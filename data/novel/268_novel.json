 "text": "THE OCTOPUS\n\nA Story of California\n\nby Frank Norris\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK 1\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nJust after passing Caraher's saloon, on the County Road that ran south\nfrom Bonneville, and that divided the Broderson ranch from that of Los\nMuertos, Presley was suddenly aware of the faint and prolonged blowing\nof a steam whistle that he knew must come from the railroad shops near\nthe depot at Bonneville. In starting out from the ranch house that\nmorning, he had forgotten his watch, and was now perplexed to know\nwhether the whistle was blowing for twelve or for one o'clock. He hoped\nthe former. Early that morning he had decided to make a long excursion\nthrough the neighbouring country, partly on foot and partly on his\nbicycle, and now noon was come already, and as yet he had hardly\nstarted. As he was leaving the house after breakfast, Mrs. Derrick had\nasked him to go for the mail at Bonneville, and he had not been able to\nrefuse.\n\nHe took a firmer hold of the cork grips of his handlebars--the road\nbeing in a wretched condition after the recent hauling of the crop--and\nquickened his pace. He told himself that, no matter what the time was,\nhe would not stop for luncheon at the ranch house, but would push on\nto Guadalajara and have a Spanish dinner at Solotari's, as he had\noriginally planned.\n\nThere had not been much of a crop to haul that year. Half of the wheat\non the Broderson ranch had failed entirely, and Derrick himself had\nhardly raised more than enough to supply seed for the winter's sowing.\nBut such little hauling as there had been had reduced the roads\nthereabouts to a lamentable condition, and, during the dry season of the\npast few months, the layer of dust had deepened and thickened to such\nan extent that more than once Presley was obliged to dismount and trudge\nalong on foot, pushing his bicycle in front of him.\n\nIt was the last half of September, the very end of the dry season, and\nall Tulare County, all the vast reaches of the San Joaquin Valley--in\nfact all South Central California, was bone dry, parched, and baked\nand crisped after four months of cloudless weather, when the day seemed\nalways at noon, and the sun blazed white hot over the valley from the\nCoast Range in the west to the foothills of the Sierras in the east.\n\nAs Presley drew near to the point where what was known as the Lower Road\nstruck off through the Rancho de Los Muertos, leading on to Guadalajara,\nhe came upon one of the county watering-tanks, a great, iron-hooped\ntower of wood, straddling clumsily on its four uprights by the roadside.\nSince the day of its completion, the storekeepers and retailers of\nBonneville had painted their advertisements upon it. It was a landmark.\nIn that reach of level fields, the white letters upon it could be read\nfor miles. A watering-trough stood near by, and, as he was very thirsty,\nPresley resolved to stop for a moment to get a drink.\n\nHe drew abreast of the tank and halted there, leaning his bicycle\nagainst the fence. A couple of men in white overalls were repainting\nthe surface of the tank, seated on swinging platforms that hung by hooks\nfrom the roof. They were painting a sign--an advertisement. It was all\nbut finished and read, “S. Behrman, Real Estate, Mortgages, Main Street,\nBonneville, Opposite the Post Office.” On the horse-trough that stood\nin the shadow of the tank was another freshly painted inscription: “S.\nBehrman Has Something To Say To You.”\n\nAs Presley straightened up after drinking from the faucet at one end of\nthe horse-trough, the watering-cart itself laboured into view around\nthe turn of the Lower Road. Two mules and two horses, white with dust,\nstrained leisurely in the traces, moving at a snail's pace, their limp\nears marking the time; while perched high upon the seat, under a yellow\ncotton wagon umbrella, Presley recognised Hooven, one of Derrick's\ntenants, a German, whom every one called “Bismarck,” an excitable little\nman with a perpetual grievance and an endless flow of broken English.\n\n“Hello, Bismarck,” said Presley, as Hooven brought his team to a\nstandstill by the tank, preparatory to refilling.\n\n“Yoost der men I look for, Mist'r Praicely,” cried the other, twisting\nthe reins around the brake. “Yoost one minute, you wait, hey? I wanta\ntalk mit you.”\n\nPresley was impatient to be on his way again. A little more time wasted,\nand the day would be lost. He had nothing to do with the management\nof the ranch, and if Hooven wanted any advice from him, it was so much\nbreath wasted. These uncouth brutes of farmhands and petty ranchers,\ngrimed with the soil they worked upon, were odious to him beyond words.\nNever could he feel in sympathy with them, nor with their lives, their\nways, their marriages, deaths, bickerings, and all the monotonous round\nof their sordid existence.\n\n“Well, you must be quick about it, Bismarck,” he answered sharply. “I'm\nlate for dinner, as it is.”\n\n“Soh, now. Two minuten, und I be mit you.” He drew down the overhanging\nspout of the tank to the vent in the circumference of the cart and\npulled the chain that let out the water. Then he climbed down from the\nseat, jumping from the tire of the wheel, and taking Presley by the arm\nled him a few steps down the road.\n\n“Say,” he began. “Say, I want to hef some converzations mit you. Yoost\nder men I want to see. Say, Caraher, he tole me dis morgen--say, he tole\nme Mist'r Derrick gowun to farm der whole demn rench hisseluf der next\nyahr. No more tenants. Say, Caraher, he tole me all der tenants get der\nsach; Mist'r Derrick gowun to work der whole demn rench hisseluf, hey?\nME, I get der sach alzoh, hey? You hef hear about dose ting? Say, me, I\nhef on der ranch been sieben yahr--seven yahr. Do I alzoh----”\n\n“You'll have to see Derrick himself or Harran about that, Bismarck,”\n interrupted Presley, trying to draw away. “That's something outside of\nme entirely.”\n\nBut Hooven was not to be put off. No doubt he had been meditating his\nspeech all the morning, formulating his words, preparing his phrases.\n\n“Say, no, no,” he continued. “Me, I wanta stay bei der place; seven yahr\nI hef stay. Mist'r Derrick, he doand want dot I should be ge-sacked.\nWho, den, will der ditch ge-tend? Say, you tell 'um Bismarck hef gotta\nsure stay bei der place. Say, you hef der pull mit der Governor. You\nspeak der gut word for me.”\n\n“Harran is the man that has the pull with his father, Bismarck,”\n answered Presley. “You get Harran to speak for you, and you're all\nright.”\n\n“Sieben yahr I hef stay,” protested Hooven, “and who will der ditch\nge-tend, und alle dem cettles drive?”\n\n“Well, Harran's your man,” answered Presley, preparing to mount his\nbicycle.\n\n“Say, you hef hear about dose ting?”\n\n“I don't hear about anything, Bismarck. I don't know the first thing\nabout how the ranch is run.”\n\n“UND DER PIPE-LINE GE-MEND,” Hooven burst out, suddenly remembering a\nforgotten argument. He waved an arm. “Ach, der pipe-line bei der Mission\nGreek, und der waater-hole for dose cettles. Say, he doand doo ut\nHIMSELLUF, berhaps, I doand tink.”\n\n“Well, talk to Harran about it.”\n\n“Say, he doand farm der whole demn rench bei hisseluf. Me, I gotta\nstay.”\n\nBut on a sudden the water in the cart gushed over the sides from the\nvent in the top with a smart sound of splashing. Hooven was forced to\nturn his attention to it. Presley got his wheel under way.\n\n“I hef some converzations mit Herran,” Hooven called after him. “He\ndoand doo ut bei hisseluf, den, Mist'r Derrick; ach, no. I stay bei der\nrench to drive dose cettles.”\n\nHe climbed back to his seat under the wagon umbrella, and, as he\nstarted his team again with great cracks of his long whip, turned to the\npainters still at work upon the sign and declared with some defiance:\n\n“Sieben yahr; yais, sir, seiben yahr I hef been on dis rench. Git oop,\nyou mule you, hoop!”\n\nMeanwhile Presley had turned into the Lower Road. He was now on\nDerrick's land, division No. I, or, as it was called, the Home ranch,\nof the great Los Muertos Rancho. The road was better here, the dust laid\nafter the passage of Hooven's watering-cart, and, in a few minutes, he\nhad come to the ranch house itself, with its white picket fence, its few\nflower beds, and grove of eucalyptus trees. On the lawn at the side\nof the house, he saw Harran in the act of setting out the automatic\nsprinkler. In the shade of the house, by the porch, were two or three\nof the greyhounds, part of the pack that were used to hunt down\njack-rabbits, and Godfrey, Harran's prize deerhound.\n\nPresley wheeled up the driveway and met Harran by the horse-block.\nHarran was Magnus Derrick's youngest son, a very well-looking young\nfellow of twenty-three or twenty-five. He had the fine carriage that\nmarked his father, and still further resembled him in that he had the\nDerrick nose--hawk-like and prominent, such as one sees in the later\nportraits of the Duke of Wellington. He was blond, and incessant\nexposure to the sun had, instead of tanning him brown, merely heightened\nthe colour of his cheeks. His yellow hair had a tendency to curl in a\nforward direction, just in front of the ears.\n\nBeside him, Presley made the sharpest of contrasts. Presley seemed to\nhave come of a mixed origin; appeared to have a nature more composite,\na temperament more complex. Unlike Harran Derrick, he seemed more of a\ncharacter than a type. The sun had browned his face till it was almost\nswarthy. His eyes were a dark brown, and his forehead was the forehead\nof the intellectual, wide and high, with a certain unmistakable lift\nabout it that argued education, not only of himself, but of his people\nbefore him. The impression conveyed by his mouth and chin was that of\na delicate and highly sensitive nature, the lips thin and loosely shut\ntogether, the chin small and rather receding. One guessed that Presley's\nrefinement had been gained only by a certain loss of strength. One\nexpected to find him nervous, introspective, to discover that his mental\nlife was not at all the result of impressions and sensations that came\nto him from without, but rather of thoughts and reflections germinating\nfrom within. Though morbidly sensitive to changes in his physical\nsurroundings, he would be slow to act upon such sensations, would not\nprove impulsive, not because he was sluggish, but because he was merely\nirresolute. It could be foreseen that morally he was of that sort\nwho avoid evil through good taste, lack of decision, and want of\nopportunity. His temperament was that of the poet; when he told himself\nhe had been thinking, he deceived himself. He had, on such occasions,\nbeen only brooding.\n\nSome eighteen months before this time, he had been threatened with\nconsumption, and, taking advantage of a standing invitation on the part\nof Magnus Derrick, had come to stay in the dry, even climate of the San\nJoaquin for an indefinite length of time. He was thirty years old,\nand had graduated and post-graduated with high honours from an\nEastern college, where he had devoted himself to a passionate study of\nliterature, and, more especially, of poetry.\n\nIt was his insatiable ambition to write verse. But up to this time,\nhis work had been fugitive, ephemeral, a note here and there, heard,\nappreciated, and forgotten. He was in search of a subject; something\nmagnificent, he did not know exactly what; some vast, tremendous theme,\nheroic, terrible, to be unrolled in all the thundering progression of\nhexameters.\n\nBut whatever he wrote, and in whatever fashion, Presley was determined\nthat his poem should be of the West, that world's frontier of Romance,\nwhere a new race, a new people--hardy, brave, and passionate--were\nbuilding an empire; where the tumultuous life ran like fire from dawn\nto dark, and from dark to dawn again, primitive, brutal, honest, and\nwithout fear. Something (to his idea not much) had been done to catch at\nthat life in passing, but its poet had not yet arisen. The few sporadic\nattempts, thus he told himself, had only touched the keynote. He strove\nfor the diapason, the great song that should embrace in itself a whole\nepoch, a complete era, the voice of an entire people, wherein all people\nshould be included--they and their legends, their folk lore, their\nfightings, their loves and their lusts, their blunt, grim humour, their\nstoicism under stress, their adventures, their treasures found in a day\nand gambled in a night, their direct, crude speech, their generosity\nand cruelty, their heroism and bestiality, their religion and profanity,\ntheir self-sacrifice and obscenity--a true and fearless setting forth of\na passing phase of history, un-compromising, sincere; each group in its\nproper environment; the valley, the plain, and the mountain; the ranch,\nthe range, and the mine--all this, all the traits and types of every\ncommunity from the Dakotas to the Mexicos, from Winnipeg to Guadalupe,\ngathered together, swept together, welded and riven together in one\nsingle, mighty song, the Song of the West. That was what he dreamed,\nwhile things without names--thoughts for which no man had yet invented\nwords, terrible formless shapes, vague figures, colossal, monstrous,\ndistorted--whirled at a gallop through his imagination.\n\nAs Harran came up, Presley reached down into the pouches of the\nsun-bleached shooting coat he wore and drew out and handed him the\npacket of letters and papers.\n\n“Here's the mail. I think I shall go on.”\n\n“But dinner is ready,” said Harran; “we are just sitting down.”\n\nPresley shook his head. “No, I'm in a hurry. Perhaps I shall have\nsomething to eat at Guadalajara. I shall be gone all day.”\n\nHe delayed a few moments longer, tightening a loose nut on his forward\nwheel, while Harran, recognising his father's handwriting on one of the\nenvelopes, slit it open and cast his eye rapidly over its pages.\n\n“The Governor is coming home,” he exclaimed, “to-morrow morning on the\nearly train; wants me to meet him with the team at Guadalajara; AND,” he\ncried between his clenched teeth, as he continued to read, “we've lost\nthe case.”\n\n“What case? Oh, in the matter of rates?”\n\nHarran nodded, his eyes flashing, his face growing suddenly scarlet.\n\n“Ulsteen gave his decision yesterday,” he continued, reading from his\nfather's letter. “He holds, Ulsteen does, that 'grain rates as low as\nthe new figure would amount to confiscation of property, and that, on\nsuch a basis, the railroad could not be operated at a legitimate profit.\nAs he is powerless to legislate in the matter, he can only put the rates\nback at what they originally were before the commissioners made the\ncut, and it is so ordered.' That's our friend S. Behrman again,” added\nHarran, grinding his teeth. “He was up in the city the whole of the time\nthe new schedule was being drawn, and he and Ulsteen and the Railroad\nCommission were as thick as thieves. He has been up there all this last\nweek, too, doing the railroad's dirty work, and backing Ulsteen up.\n'Legitimate profit, legitimate profit,'” he broke out. “Can we raise\nwheat at a legitimate profit with a tariff of four dollars a ton for\nmoving it two hundred miles to tide-water, with wheat at eighty-seven\ncents? Why not hold us up with a gun in our faces, and say, 'hands up,'\nand be done with it?”\n\nHe dug his boot-heel into the ground and turned away to the house\nabruptly, cursing beneath his breath.\n\n“By the way,” Presley called after him, “Hooven wants to see you. He\nasked me about this idea of the Governor's of getting along without the\ntenants this year. Hooven wants to stay to tend the ditch and look after\nthe stock. I told him to see you.”\n\nHarran, his mind full of other things, nodded to say he understood.\nPresley only waited till he had disappeared indoors, so that he might\nnot seem too indifferent to his trouble; then, remounting, struck at\nonce into a brisk pace, and, turning out from the carriage gate, held\non swiftly down the Lower Road, going in the direction of Guadalajara.\nThese matters, these eternal fierce bickerings between the farmers of\nthe San Joaquin and the Pacific and Southwestern Railroad irritated him\nand wearied him. He cared for none of these things. They did not belong\nto his world. In the picture of that huge romantic West that he saw in\nhis imagination, these dissensions made the one note of harsh colour\nthat refused to enter into the great scheme of harmony. It was material,\nsordid, deadly commonplace. But, however he strove to shut his eyes to\nit or his ears to it, the thing persisted and persisted. The romance\nseemed complete up to that point. There it broke, there it failed, there\nit became realism, grim, unlovely, unyielding. To be true--and it was\nthe first article of his creed to be unflinchingly true--he could not\nignore it. All the noble poetry of the ranch--the valley--seemed in his\nmind to be marred and disfigured by the presence of certain immovable\nfacts. Just what he wanted, Presley hardly knew. On one hand, it was his\nambition to portray life as he saw it--directly, frankly, and through no\nmedium of personality or temperament. But, on the other hand, as well,\nhe wished to see everything through a rose-coloured mist--a mist that\ndulled all harsh outlines, all crude and violent colours. He told\nhimself that, as a part of the people, he loved the people and\nsympathised with their hopes and fears, and joys and griefs; and yet\nHooven, grimy and perspiring, with his perpetual grievance and his\ncontracted horizon, only revolted him. He had set himself the task of\ngiving true, absolutely true, poetical expression to the life of the\nranch, and yet, again and again, he brought up against the railroad,\nthat stubborn iron barrier against which his romance shattered itself to\nfroth and disintegrated, flying spume. His heart went out to the people,\nand his groping hand met that of a slovenly little Dutchman, whom it was\nimpossible to consider seriously. He searched for the True Romance, and,\nin the end, found grain rates and unjust freight tariffs.\n\n“But the stuff is HERE,” he muttered, as he sent his wheel rumbling\nacross the bridge over Broderson Creek. “The romance, the real romance,\nis here somewhere. I'll get hold of it yet.”\n\nHe shot a glance about him as if in search of the inspiration. By now he\nwas not quite half way across the northern and narrowest corner of Los\nMuertos, at this point some eight miles wide. He was still on the Home\nranch. A few miles to the south he could just make out the line of wire\nfence that separated it from the third division; and to the north, seen\nfaint and blue through the haze and shimmer of the noon sun, a long file\nof telegraph poles showed the line of the railroad and marked Derrick's\nnortheast boundary. The road over which Presley was travelling ran\nalmost diametrically straight. In front of him, but at a great distance,\nhe could make out the giant live-oak and the red roof of Hooven's barn\nthat stood near it.\n\nAll about him the country was flat. In all directions he could see for\nmiles. The harvest was just over. Nothing but stubble remained on the\nground. With the one exception of the live-oak by Hooven's place, there\nwas nothing green in sight. The wheat stubble was of a dirty yellow; the\nground, parched, cracked, and dry, of a cheerless brown. By the roadside\nthe dust lay thick and grey, and, on either hand, stretching on toward\nthe horizon, losing itself in a mere smudge in the distance, ran the\nillimitable parallels of the wire fence. And that was all; that and the\nburnt-out blue of the sky and the steady shimmer of the heat.\n\nThe silence was infinite. After the harvest, small though that harvest\nhad been, the ranches seemed asleep. It was as though the earth, after\nits period of reproduction, its pains of labour, had been delivered of\nthe fruit of its loins, and now slept the sleep of exhaustion.\n\nIt was the period between seasons, when nothing was being done, when the\nnatural forces seemed to hang suspended. There was no rain, there was no\nwind, there was no growth, no life; the very stubble had no force even\nto rot. The sun alone moved.\n\nToward two o'clock, Presley reached Hooven's place, two or three grimy\nframe buildings, infested with a swarm of dogs. A hog or two wandered\naimlessly about. Under a shed by the barn, a broken-down seeder lay\nrusting to its ruin. But overhead, a mammoth live-oak, the largest tree\nin all the country-side, towered superb and magnificent. Grey bunches\nof mistletoe and festoons of trailing moss hung from its bark. From its\nlowest branch hung Hooven's meat-safe, a square box, faced with wire\nscreens.\n\nWhat gave a special interest to Hooven's was the fact that here was the\nintersection of the Lower Road and Derrick's main irrigating ditch, a\nvast trench not yet completed, which he and Annixter, who worked the\nQuien Sabe ranch, were jointly constructing. It ran directly across\nthe road and at right angles to it, and lay a deep groove in the field\nbetween Hooven's and the town of Guadalajara, some three miles farther\non. Besides this, the ditch was a natural boundary between two divisions\nof the Los Muertos ranch, the first and fourth.\n\nPresley now had the choice of two routes. His objective point was the\nspring at the headwaters of Broderson Creek, in the hills on the\neastern side of the Quien Sabe ranch. The trail afforded him a short cut\nthitherward. As he passed the house, Mrs. Hooven came to the door, her\nlittle daughter Hilda, dressed in a boy's overalls and clumsy boots, at\nher skirts. Minna, her oldest daughter, a very pretty girl, whose\nlove affairs were continually the talk of all Los Muertos, was visible\nthrough a window of the house, busy at the week's washing. Mrs. Hooven\nwas a faded, colourless woman, middle-aged and commonplace, and offering\nnot the least characteristic that would distinguish her from a thousand\nother women of her class and kind. She nodded to Presley, watching\nhim with a stolid gaze from under her arm, which she held across her\nforehead to shade her eyes.\n\nBut now Presley exerted himself in good earnest. His bicycle flew.\nHe resolved that after all he would go to Guadalajara. He crossed the\nbridge over the irrigating ditch with a brusque spurt of hollow sound,\nand shot forward down the last stretch of the Lower Road that yet\nintervened between Hooven's and the town. He was on the fourth division\nof the ranch now, the only one whereon the wheat had been successful, no\ndoubt because of the Little Mission Creek that ran through it. But he no\nlonger occupied himself with the landscape. His only concern was to get\non as fast as possible. He had looked forward to spending nearly the\nwhole day on the crest of the wooded hills in the northern corner of the\nQuien Sabe ranch, reading, idling, smoking his pipe. But now he would\ndo well if he arrived there by the middle of the afternoon. In a few\nmoments he had reached the line fence that marked the limits of the\nranch. Here were the railroad tracks, and just beyond--a huddled mass of\nroofs, with here and there an adobe house on its outskirts--the little\ntown of Guadalajara. Nearer at hand, and directly in front of Presley,\nwere the freight and passenger depots of the P. and S. W., painted in\nthe grey and white, which seemed to be the official colours of all the\nbuildings owned by the corporation. The station was deserted. No trains\npassed at this hour. From the direction of the ticket window, Presley\nheard the unsteady chittering of the telegraph key. In the shadow of\none of the baggage trucks upon the platform, the great yellow cat that\nbelonged to the agent dozed complacently, her paws tucked under her\nbody. Three flat cars, loaded with bright-painted farming machines,\nwere on the siding above the station, while, on the switch below, a huge\nfreight engine that lacked its cow-catcher sat back upon its monstrous\ndriving-wheels, motionless, solid, drawing long breaths that were\npunctuated by the subdued sound of its steam-pump clicking at exact\nintervals.\n\nBut evidently it had been decreed that Presley should be stopped at\nevery point of his ride that day, for, as he was pushing his bicycle\nacross the tracks, he was surprised to hear his name called. “Hello,\nthere, Mr. Presley. What's the good word?”\n\nPresley looked up quickly, and saw Dyke, the engineer, leaning on\nhis folded arms from the cab window of the freight engine. But at the\nprospect of this further delay, Presley was less troubled. Dyke and he\nwere well acquainted and the best of friends. The picturesqueness of the\nengineer's life was always attractive to Presley, and more than once he\nhad ridden on Dyke's engine between Guadalajara and Bonneville. Once,\neven, he had made the entire run between the latter town and San\nFrancisco in the cab.\n\nDyke's home was in Guadalajara. He lived in one of the remodelled 'dobe\ncottages, where his mother kept house for him. His wife had died some\nfive years before this time, leaving him a little daughter, Sidney, to\nbring up as best he could. Dyke himself was a heavy built, well-looking\nfellow, nearly twice the weight of Presley, with great shoulders and\nmassive, hairy arms, and a tremendous, rumbling voice.\n\n“Hello, old man,” answered Presley, coming up to the engine. “What are\nyou doing about here at this time of day? I thought you were on the\nnight service this month.”\n\n“We've changed about a bit,” answered the other. “Come up here and sit\ndown, and get out of the sun. They've held us here to wait orders,” he\nexplained, as Presley, after leaning his bicycle against the tender,\nclimbed to the fireman's seat of worn green leather. “They are changing\nthe run of one of the crack passenger engines down below, and are\nsending her up to Fresno. There was a smash of some kind on the\nBakersfield division, and she's to hell and gone behind her time. I\nsuppose when she comes, she'll come a-humming. It will be stand clear\nand an open track all the way to Fresno. They have held me here to let\nher go by.”\n\nHe took his pipe, an old T. D. clay, but coloured to a beautiful shiny\nblack, from the pocket of his jumper and filled and lit it.\n\n“Well, I don't suppose you object to being held here,” observed Presley.\n“Gives you a chance to visit your mother and the little girl.”\n\n“And precisely they choose this day to go up to Sacramento,” answered\nDyke. “Just my luck. Went up to visit my brother's people. By the way,\nmy brother may come down here--locate here, I mean--and go into the\nhop-raising business. He's got an option on five hundred acres just back\nof the town here. He says there is going to be money in hops. I don't\nknow; may be I'll go in with him.”\n\n“Why, what's the matter with railroading?”\n\nDyke drew a couple of puffs on his pipe, and fixed Presley with a\nglance.\n\n“There's this the matter with it,” he said; “I'm fired.”\n\n“Fired! You!” exclaimed Presley, turning abruptly toward him. “That's\nwhat I'm telling you,” returned Dyke grimly.\n\n“You don't mean it. Why, what for, Dyke?”\n\n“Now, YOU tell me what for,” growled the other savagely. “Boy and man,\nI've worked for the P. and S. W. for over ten years, and never one yelp\nof a complaint did I ever hear from them. They know damn well they've\nnot got a steadier man on the road. And more than that, more than that,\nI don't belong to the Brotherhood. And when the strike came along, I\nstood by them--stood by the company. You know that. And you know, and\nthey know, that at Sacramento that time, I ran my train according to\nschedule, with a gun in each hand, never knowing when I was going over a\nmined culvert, and there was talk of giving me a gold watch at the\ntime. To hell with their gold watches! I want ordinary justice and fair\ntreatment. And now, when hard times come along, and they are cutting\nwages, what do they do? Do they make any discrimination in my case? Do\nthey remember the man that stood by them and risked his life in their\nservice? No. They cut my pay down just as off-hand as they do the pay\nof any dirty little wiper in the yard. Cut me along with--listen to\nthis--cut me along with men that they had BLACK-LISTED; strikers that\nthey took back because they were short of hands.” He drew fiercely on\nhis pipe. “I went to them, yes, I did; I went to the General Office, and\nate dirt. I told them I was a family man, and that I didn't see how\nI was going to get along on the new scale, and I reminded them of my\nservice during the strike. The swine told me that it wouldn't be fair\nto discriminate in favour of one man, and that the cut must apply to all\ntheir employees alike. Fair!” he shouted with laughter. “Fair! Hear the\nP. and S. W. talking about fairness and discrimination. That's good,\nthat is. Well, I got furious. I was a fool, I suppose. I told them that,\nin justice to myself, I wouldn't do first-class work for third-class\npay. And they said, 'Well, Mr. Dyke, you know what you can do.' Well, I\ndid know. I said, 'I'll ask for my time, if you please,' and they gave\nit to me just as if they were glad to be shut of me. So there you are,\nPresley. That's the P. & S. W. Railroad Company of California. I am on\nmy last run now.”\n\n“Shameful,” declared Presley, his sympathies all aroused, now that the\ntrouble concerned a friend of his. “It's shameful, Dyke. But,” he added,\nan idea occurring to him, “that don't shut you out from work. There are\nother railroads in the State that are not controlled by the P. and S.\nW.”\n\nDyke smote his knee with his clenched fist.\n\n“NAME ONE.”\n\nPresley was silent. Dyke's challenge was unanswerable. There was a lapse\nin their talk, Presley drumming on the arm of the seat, meditating on\nthis injustice; Dyke looking off over the fields beyond the town, his\nfrown lowering, his teeth rasping upon his pipestem. The station agent\ncame to the door of the depot, stretching and yawning. On ahead of the\nengine, the empty rails of the track, reaching out toward the horizon,\nthrew off visible layers of heat. The telegraph key clicked incessantly.\n\n“So I'm going to quit,” Dyke remarked after a while, his anger somewhat\nsubsided. “My brother and I will take up this hop ranch. I've saved a\ngood deal in the last ten years, and there ought to be money in hops.”\n\nPresley went on, remounting his bicycle, wheeling silently through the\ndeserted streets of the decayed and dying Mexican town. It was the hour\nof the siesta. Nobody was about. There was no business in the town. It\nwas too close to Bonneville for that. Before the railroad came, and\nin the days when the raising of cattle was the great industry of\nthe country, it had enjoyed a fierce and brilliant life. Now it was\nmoribund. The drug store, the two bar-rooms, the hotel at the corner of\nthe old Plaza, and the shops where Mexican “curios” were sold to those\noccasional Eastern tourists who came to visit the Mission of San Juan,\nsufficed for the town's activity.\n\nAt Solotari's, the restaurant on the Plaza, diagonally across from the\nhotel, Presley ate his long-deferred Mexican dinner--an omelette in\nSpanish-Mexican style, frijoles and tortillas, a salad, and a glass\nof white wine. In a corner of the room, during the whole course of his\ndinner, two young Mexicans (one of whom was astonishingly handsome,\nafter the melodramatic fashion of his race) and an old fellow! the\ncentenarian of the town, decrepit beyond belief, sang an interminable\nlove-song to the accompaniment of a guitar and an accordion.\n\nThese Spanish-Mexicans, decayed, picturesque, vicious, and romantic,\nnever failed to interest Presley. A few of them still remained in\nGuadalajara, drifting from the saloon to the restaurant, and from the\nrestaurant to the Plaza, relics of a former generation, standing for a\ndifferent order of things, absolutely idle, living God knew how, happy\nwith their cigarette, their guitar, their glass of mescal, and their\nsiesta. The centenarian remembered Fremont and Governor Alvarado, and\nthe bandit Jesus Tejeda, and the days when Los Muertos was a Spanish\ngrant, a veritable principality, leagues in extent, and when there\nwas never a fence from Visalia to Fresno. Upon this occasion, Presley\noffered the old man a drink of mescal, and excited him to talk of the\nthings he remembered. Their talk was in Spanish, a language with which\nPresley was familiar.\n\n“De La Cuesta held the grant of Los Muertos in those days,” the\ncentenarian said; “a grand man. He had the power of life and death over\nhis people, and there was no law but his word. There was no thought of\nwheat then, you may believe. It was all cattle in those days, sheep,\nhorses--steers, not so many--and if money was scarce, there was always\nplenty to eat, and clothes enough for all, and wine, ah, yes, by the\nvat, and oil too; the Mission Fathers had that. Yes, and there was wheat\nas well, now that I come to think; but a very little--in the field north\nof the Mission where now it is the Seed ranch; wheat fields were there,\nand also a vineyard, all on Mission grounds. Wheat, olives, and the\nvine; the Fathers planted those, to provide the elements of the Holy\nSacrament--bread, oil, and wine, you understand. It was like that, those\nindustries began in California--from the Church; and now,” he put his\nchin in the air, “what would Father Ullivari have said to such a crop\nas Senor Derrick plants these days? Ten thousand acres of wheat! Nothing\nbut wheat from the Sierra to the Coast Range. I remember when De La\nCuesta was married. He had never seen the young lady, only her miniature\nportrait, painted”--he raised a shoulder--“I do not know by whom, small,\na little thing to be held in the palm. But he fell in love with that,\nand marry her he would. The affair was arranged between him and the\ngirl's parents. But when the time came that De La Cuesta was to go to\nMonterey to meet and marry the girl, behold, Jesus Tejeda broke in upon\nthe small rancheros near Terrabella. It was no time for De La Cuesta to\nbe away, so he sent his brother Esteban to Monterey to marry the girl by\nproxy for him. I went with Esteban. We were a company, nearly a hundred\nmen. And De La Cuesta sent a horse for the girl to ride, white, pure\nwhite; and the saddle was of red leather; the head-stall, the bit,\nand buckles, all the metal work, of virgin silver. Well, there was\na ceremony in the Monterey Mission, and Esteban, in the name of his\nbrother, was married to the girl. On our way back, De La Cuesta rode\nout to meet us. His company met ours at Agatha dos Palos. Never will\nI forget De La Cuesta's face as his eyes fell upon the girl. It was a\nlook, a glance, come and gone like THAT,” he snapped his fingers. “No\none but I saw it, but I was close by. There was no mistaking that look.\nDe La Cuesta was disappointed.”\n\n“And the girl?” demanded Presley.\n\n“She never knew. Ah, he was a grand gentleman, De La Cuesta. Always he\ntreated her as a queen. Never was husband more devoted, more respectful,\nmore chivalrous. But love?” The old fellow put his chin in the air,\nshutting his eyes in a knowing fashion. “It was not there. I could tell.\nThey were married over again at the Mission San Juan de Guadalajara--OUR\nMission--and for a week all the town of Guadalajara was in fete. There\nwere bull-fights in the Plaza--this very one--for five days, and to each\nof his tenants-in-chief, De La Cuesta gave a horse, a barrel of tallow,\nan ounce of silver, and half an ounce of gold dust. Ah, those were days.\nThat was a gay life. This”--he made a comprehensive gesture with his\nleft hand--“this is stupid.”\n\n“You may well say that,” observed Presley moodily, discouraged by the\nother's talk. All his doubts and uncertainty had returned to him. Never\nwould he grasp the subject of his great poem. To-day, the life was\ncolourless. Romance was dead. He had lived too late. To write of the\npast was not what he desired. Reality was what he longed for, things\nthat he had seen. Yet how to make this compatible with romance. He rose,\nputting on his hat, offering the old man a cigarette. The centenarian\naccepted with the air of a grandee, and extended his horn snuff-box.\nPresley shook his head.\n\n“I was born too late for that,” he declared, “for that, and for many\nother things. Adios.”\n\n“You are travelling to-day, senor?”\n\n“A little turn through the country, to get the kinks out of the\nmuscles,” Presley answered. “I go up into the Quien Sabe, into the high\ncountry beyond the Mission.”\n\n“Ah, the Quien Sabe rancho. The sheep are grazing there this week.”\n\nSolotari, the keeper of the restaurant, explained:\n\n“Young Annixter sold his wheat stubble on the ground to the sheep\nraisers off yonder;” he motioned eastward toward the Sierra foothills.\n“Since Sunday the herd has been down. Very clever, that young Annixter.\nHe gets a price for his stubble, which else he would have to burn, and\nalso manures his land as the sheep move from place to place. A true\nYankee, that Annixter, a good gringo.”\n\nAfter his meal, Presley once more mounted his bicycle, and leaving the\nrestaurant and the Plaza behind him, held on through the main street of\nthe drowsing town--the street that farther on developed into the road\nwhich turned abruptly northward and led onward through the hop-fields\nand the Quien Sabe ranch toward the Mission of San Juan.\n\nThe Home ranch of the Quien Sabe was in the little triangle bounded on\nthe south by the railroad, on the northwest by Broderson Creek, and on\nthe east by the hop fields and the Mission lands. It was traversed in\nall directions, now by the trail from Hooven's, now by the irrigating\nditch--the same which Presley had crossed earlier in the day--and again\nby the road upon which Presley then found himself. In its centre were\nAnnixter's ranch house and barns, topped by the skeleton-like tower of\nthe artesian well that was to feed the irrigating ditch. Farther on,\nthe course of Broderson Creek was marked by a curved line of grey-green\nwillows, while on the low hills to the north, as Presley advanced, the\nancient Mission of San Juan de Guadalajara, with its belfry tower and\nred-tiled roof, began to show itself over the crests of the venerable\npear trees that clustered in its garden.\n\nWhen Presley reached Annixter's ranch house, he found young Annixter\nhimself stretched in his hammock behind the mosquito-bar on the front\nporch, reading “David Copperfield,” and gorging himself with dried\nprunes.\n\nAnnixter--after the two had exchanged greetings--complained of terrific\ncolics all the preceding night. His stomach was out of whack, but\nyou bet he knew how to take care of himself; the last spell, he had\nconsulted a doctor at Bonneville, a gibbering busy-face who had filled\nhim up to the neck with a dose of some hogwash stuff that had made him\nworse--a healthy lot the doctors knew, anyhow. HIS case was peculiar. HE\nknew; prunes were what he needed, and by the pound.\n\nAnnixter, who worked the Quien Sabe ranch--some four thousand acres\nof rich clay and heavy loams--was a very young man, younger even than\nPresley, like him a college graduate. He looked never a year older than\nhe was. He was smooth-shaven and lean built. But his youthful appearance\nwas offset by a certain male cast of countenance, the lower lip thrust\nout, the chin large and deeply cleft. His university course had hardened\nrather than polished him. He still remained one of the people, rough\nalmost to insolence, direct in speech, intolerant in his opinions,\nrelying upon absolutely no one but himself; yet, with all this, of\nan astonishing degree of intelligence, and possessed of an executive\nability little short of positive genius. He was a ferocious worker,\nallowing himself no pleasures, and exacting the same degree of energy\nfrom all his subordinates. He was widely hated, and as widely trusted.\nEvery one spoke of his crusty temper and bullying disposition,\ninvariably qualifying the statement with a commendation of his resources\nand capabilities. The devil of a driver, a hard man to get along with,\nobstinate, contrary, cantankerous; but brains! No doubt of that; brains\nto his boots. One would like to see the man who could get ahead of him\non a deal. Twice he had been shot at, once from ambush on Osterman's\nranch, and once by one of his own men whom he had kicked from the\nsacking platform of his harvester for gross negligence. At college,\nhe had specialised on finance, political economy, and scientific\nagriculture. After his graduation (he stood almost at the very top of\nhis class) he had returned and obtained the degree of civil engineer.\nThen suddenly he had taken a notion that a practical knowledge of law\nwas indispensable to a modern farmer. In eight months he did the work of\nthree years, studying for his bar examinations. His method of study was\ncharacteristic. He reduced all the material of his text-books to notes.\nTearing out the leaves of these note-books, he pasted them upon the\nwalls of his room; then, in his shirt-sleeves, a cheap cigar in his\nteeth, his hands in his pockets, he walked around and around the room,\nscowling fiercely at his notes, memorising, devouring, digesting. At\nintervals, he drank great cupfuls of unsweetened, black coffee. When the\nbar examinations were held, he was admitted at the very head of all the\napplicants, and was complimented by the judge. Immediately afterwards,\nhe collapsed with nervous prostration; his stomach “got out of whack,”\n and he all but died in a Sacramento boarding-house, obstinately refusing\nto have anything to do with doctors, whom he vituperated as a rabble\nof quacks, dosing himself with a patent medicine and stuffing himself\nalmost to bursting with liver pills and dried prunes.\n\nHe had taken a trip to Europe after this sickness to put himself\ncompletely to rights. He intended to be gone a year, but returned at\nthe end of six weeks, fulminating abuse of European cooking. Nearly his\nentire time had been spent in Paris; but of this sojourn he had brought\nback but two souvenirs, an electro-plated bill-hook and an empty bird\ncage which had tickled his fancy immensely.\n\nHe was wealthy. Only a year previous to this his father--a widower, who\nhad amassed a fortune in land speculation--had died, and Annixter, the\nonly son, had come into the inheritance.\n\nFor Presley, Annixter professed a great admiration, holding in deep\nrespect the man who could rhyme words, deferring to him whenever there\nwas question of literature or works of fiction. No doubt, there was\nnot much use in poetry, and as for novels, to his mind, there were only\nDickens's works. Everything else was a lot of lies. But just the same,\nit took brains to grind out a poem. It wasn't every one who could rhyme\n“brave” and “glaive,” and make sense out of it. Sure not.\n\nBut Presley's case was a notable exception. On no occasion was\nAnnixter prepared to accept another man's opinion without reserve.\nIn conversation with him, it was almost impossible to make any direct\nstatement, however trivial, that he would accept without either\nmodification or open contradiction. He had a passion for violent\ndiscussion. He would argue upon every subject in the range of\nhuman knowledge, from astronomy to the tariff, from the doctrine of\npredestination to the height of a horse. Never would he admit himself to\nbe mistaken; when cornered, he would intrench himself behind the remark,\n“Yes, that's all very well. In some ways, it is, and then, again, in\nsome ways, it ISN'T.”\n\nSingularly enough, he and Presley were the best of friends. More than\nonce, Presley marvelled at this state of affairs, telling himself\nthat he and Annixter had nothing in common. In all his circle of\nacquaintances, Presley was the one man with whom Annixter had never\nquarrelled. The two men were diametrically opposed in temperament.\nPresley was easy-going; Annixter, alert. Presley was a confirmed\ndreamer, irresolute, inactive, with a strong tendency to melancholy;\nthe young farmer was a man of affairs, decisive, combative, whose\nonly reflection upon his interior economy was a morbid concern in\nthe vagaries of his stomach. Yet the two never met without a mutual\npleasure, taking a genuine interest in each other's affairs, and often\nputting themselves to great inconvenience to be of trifling service to\nhelp one another.\n\nAs a last characteristic, Annixter pretended to be a woman-hater, for\nno other reason than that he was a very bull-calf of awkwardness in\nfeminine surroundings. Feemales! Rot! There was a fine way for a man to\nwaste his time and his good money, lally gagging with a lot of feemales.\nNo, thank you; none of it in HIS, if you please. Once only he had an\naffair--a timid, little creature in a glove-cleaning establishment in\nSacramento, whom he had picked up, Heaven knew how. After his return\nto his ranch, a correspondence had been maintained between the two,\nAnnixter taking the precaution to typewrite his letters, and never\naffixing his signature, in an excess of prudence. He furthermore made\ncarbon copies of all his letters, filing them away in a compartment\nof his safe. Ah, it would be a clever feemale who would get him into a\nmess. Then, suddenly smitten with a panic terror that he had committed\nhimself, that he was involving himself too deeply, he had abruptly sent\nthe little woman about her business. It was his only love affair. After\nthat, he kept himself free. No petticoats should ever have a hold on\nhim. Sure not.\n\nAs Presley came up to the edge of the porch, pushing his bicycle in\nfront of him, Annixter excused himself for not getting up, alleging that\nthe cramps returned the moment he was off his back.\n\n“What are you doing up this way?” he demanded.\n\n“Oh, just having a look around,” answered Presley. “How's the ranch?”\n\n“Say,” observed the other, ignoring his question, “what's this I hear\nabout Derrick giving his tenants the bounce, and working Los Muertos\nhimself--working ALL his land?”\n\nPresley made a sharp movement of impatience with his free hand. “I've\nheard nothing else myself since morning. I suppose it must be so.”\n\n“Huh!” grunted Annixter, spitting out a prune stone. “You give Magnus\nDerrick my compliments and tell him he's a fool.” “What do you mean?”\n\n“I suppose Derrick thinks he's still running his mine, and that the same\nprinciples will apply to getting grain out of the earth as to getting\ngold. Oh, let him go on and see where he brings up. That's right,\nthere's your Western farmer,” he exclaimed contemptuously. “Get the\nguts out of your land; work it to death; never give it a rest. Never\nalternate your crop, and then when your soil is exhausted, sit down and\nroar about hard times.”\n\n“I suppose Magnus thinks the land has had rest enough these last two dry\nseasons,” observed Presley. “He has raised no crop to speak of for two\nyears. The land has had a good rest.”\n\n“Ah, yes, that sounds well,” Annixter contradicted, unwilling to be\nconvinced. “In a way, the land's been rested, and then, again, in a way,\nit hasn't.”\n\nBut Presley, scenting an argument, refrained from answering, and\nbethought himself of moving on.\n\n“I'm going to leave my wheel here for a while, Buck,” he said, “if you\ndon't mind. I'm going up to the spring, and the road is rough between\nhere and there.”\n\n“Stop in for dinner on your way back,” said Annixter. “There'll be a\nvenison steak. One of the boys got a deer over in the foothills last\nweek. Out of season, but never mind that. I can't eat it. This stomach\nof mine wouldn't digest sweet oil to-day. Get here about six.”\n\n“Well, maybe I will, thank you,” said Presley, moving off. “By the way,”\n he added, “I see your barn is about done.”\n\n“You bet,” answered Annixter. “In about a fortnight now she'll be all\nready.”\n\n“It's a big barn,” murmured Presley, glancing around the angle of the\nhouse toward where the great structure stood.\n\n“Guess we'll have to have a dance there before we move the stock in,”\n observed Annixter. “That's the custom all around here.”\n\nPresley took himself off, but at the gate Annixter called after him, his\nmouth full of prunes, “Say, take a look at that herd of sheep as you go\nup. They are right off here to the east of the road, about half a mile\nfrom here. I guess that's the biggest lot of sheep YOU ever saw. You\nmight write a poem about 'em. Lamb--ram; sheep graze--sunny days. Catch\non?”\n\nBeyond Broderson Creek, as Presley advanced, tramping along on foot now,\nthe land opened out again into the same vast spaces of dull brown earth,\nsprinkled with stubble, such as had been characteristic of Derrick's\nranch. To the east the reach seemed infinite, flat, cheerless,\nheat-ridden, unrolling like a gigantic scroll toward the faint shimmer\nof the distant horizons, with here and there an isolated live-oak to\nbreak the sombre monotony. But bordering the road to the westward, the\nsurface roughened and raised, clambering up to the higher ground, on the\ncrest of which the old Mission and its surrounding pear trees were now\nplainly visible.\n\nJust beyond the Mission, the road bent abruptly eastward, striking off\nacross the Seed ranch. But Presley left the road at this point, going\non across the open fields. There was no longer any trail. It was toward\nthree o'clock. The sun still spun, a silent, blazing disc, high in the\nheavens, and tramping through the clods of uneven, broken plough was\nfatiguing work. The slope of the lowest foothills begun, the surface of\nthe country became rolling, and, suddenly, as he topped a higher ridge,\nPresley came upon the sheep.\n\nAlready he had passed the larger part of the herd--an intervening rise\nof ground having hidden it from sight. Now, as he turned half way about,\nlooking down into the shallow hollow between him and the curve of the\ncreek, he saw them very plainly. The fringe of the herd was some two\nhundred yards distant, but its farther side, in that illusive shimmer of\nhot surface air, seemed miles away. The sheep were spread out roughly\nin the shape of a figure eight, two larger herds connected by a smaller,\nand were headed to the southward, moving slowly, grazing on the wheat\nstubble as they proceeded. But the number seemed incalculable. Hundreds\nupon hundreds upon hundreds of grey, rounded backs, all exactly alike,\nhuddled, close-packed, alive, hid the earth from sight. It was no longer\nan aggregate of individuals. It was a mass--a compact, solid, slowly\nmoving mass, huge, without form, like a thick-pressed growth of\nmushrooms, spreading out in all directions over the earth. From it there\narose a vague murmur, confused, inarticulate, like the sound of very\ndistant surf, while all the air in the vicinity was heavy with the warm,\nammoniacal odour of the thousands of crowding bodies.\n\nAll the colours of the scene were sombre--the brown of the earth, the\nfaded yellow of the dead stubble, the grey of the myriad of undulating\nbacks. Only on the far side of the herd, erect, motionless--a single\nnote of black, a speck, a dot--the shepherd stood, leaning upon an empty\nwater-trough, solitary, grave, impressive.\n\nFor a few moments, Presley stood, watching. Then, as he started to move\non, a curious thing occurred. At first, he thought he had heard some one\ncall his name. He paused, listening; there was no sound but the vague\nnoise of the moving sheep. Then, as this first impression passed, it\nseemed to him that he had been beckoned to. Yet nothing stirred; except\nfor the lonely figure beyond the herd there was no one in sight. He\nstarted on again, and in half a dozen steps found himself looking over\nhis shoulder. Without knowing why, he looked toward the shepherd; then\nhalted and looked a second time and a third. Had the shepherd called\nto him? Presley knew that he had heard no voice. Brusquely, all his\nattention seemed riveted upon this distant figure. He put one forearm\nover his eyes, to keep off the sun, gazing across the intervening herd.\nSurely, the shepherd had called him. But at the next instant he started,\nuttering an exclamation under his breath. The far-away speck of black\nbecame animated. Presley remarked a sweeping gesture. Though the man\nhad not beckoned to him before, there was no doubt that he was beckoning\nnow. Without any hesitation, and singularly interested in the incident,\nPresley turned sharply aside and hurried on toward the shepherd,\nskirting the herd, wondering all the time that he should answer the call\nwith so little question, so little hesitation.\n\nBut the shepherd came forward to meet Presley, followed by one of his\ndogs. As the two men approached each other, Presley, closely studying\nthe other, began to wonder where he had seen him before. It must have\nbeen a very long time ago, upon one of his previous visits to the ranch.\nCertainly, however, there was something familiar in the shepherd's face\nand figure. When they came closer to each other, and Presley could see\nhim more distinctly, this sense of a previous acquaintance was increased\nand sharpened.\n\nThe shepherd was a man of about thirty-five. He was very lean and spare.\nHis brown canvas overalls were thrust into laced boots. A cartridge belt\nwithout any cartridges encircled his waist. A grey flannel shirt, open\nat the throat, showed his breast, tanned and ruddy. He wore no hat. His\nhair was very black and rather long. A pointed beard covered his chin,\ngrowing straight and fine from the hollow cheeks. The absence of any\ncovering for his head was, no doubt, habitual with him, for his face was\nas brown as an Indian's--a ruddy brown quite different from Presley's\ndark olive. To Presley's morbidly keen observation, the general\nimpression of the shepherd's face was intensely interesting. It was\nuncommon to an astonishing degree. Presley's vivid imagination chose to\nsee in it the face of an ascetic, of a recluse, almost that of a young\nseer. So must have appeared the half-inspired shepherds of the Hebraic\nlegends, the younger prophets of Israel, dwellers in the wilderness,\nbeholders of visions, having their existence in a continual dream,\ntalkers with God, gifted with strange powers.\n\nSuddenly, at some twenty paces distant from the approaching shepherd,\nPresley stopped short, his eyes riveted upon the other.\n\n“Vanamee!” he exclaimed.\n\nThe shepherd smiled and came forward, holding out his hands, saying, “I\nthought it was you. When I saw you come over the hill, I called you.”\n\n“But not with your voice,” returned Presley. “I knew that some one\nwanted me. I felt it. I should have remembered that you could do that\nkind of thing.”\n\n“I have never known it to fail. It helps with the sheep.”\n\n“With the sheep?”\n\n“In a way. I can't tell exactly how. We don't understand these things\nyet. There are times when, if I close my eyes and dig my fists into\nmy temples, I can hold the entire herd for perhaps a minute. Perhaps,\nthough, it's imagination, who knows? But it's good to see you again. How\nlong has it been since the last time? Two, three, nearly five years.”\n\nIt was more than that. It was six years since Presley and Vanamee had\nmet, and then it had been for a short time only, during one of the\nshepherd's periodical brief returns to that part of the country. During\na week he and Presley had been much together, for the two were devoted\nfriends. Then, as abruptly, as mysteriously as he had come, Vanamee\ndisappeared. Presley awoke one morning to find him gone. Thus, it had\nbeen with Vanamee for a period of sixteen years. He lived his life in\nthe unknown, one could not tell where--in the desert, in the mountains,\nthroughout all the vast and vague South-west, solitary, strange. Three,\nfour, five years passed. The shepherd would be almost forgotten. Never\nthe most trivial scrap of information as to his whereabouts reached Los\nMuertos. He had melted off into the surface-shimmer of the desert, into\nthe mirage; he sank below the horizons; he was swallowed up in the waste\nof sand and sage. Then, without warning, he would reappear, coming in\nfrom the wilderness, emerging from the unknown. No one knew him well. In\nall that countryside he had but three friends, Presley, Magnus Derrick,\nand the priest at the Mission of San Juan de Guadalajara, Father Sarria.\nHe remained always a mystery, living a life half-real, half-legendary.\nIn all those years he did not seem to have grown older by a single day.\nAt this time, Presley knew him to be thirty-six years of age. But since\nthe first day the two had met, the shepherd's face and bearing had, to\nhis eyes, remained the same. At this moment, Presley was looking into\nthe same face he had first seen many, many years ago. It was a face\nstamped with an unspeakable sadness, a deathless grief, the permanent\nimprint of a tragedy long past, but yet a living issue. Presley told\nhimself that it was impossible to look long into Vanamee's eyes without\nknowing that here was a man whose whole being had been at one time\nshattered and riven to its lowest depths, whose life had suddenly\nstopped at a certain moment of its development.\n\nThe two friends sat down upon the ledge of the watering-trough, their\neyes wandering incessantly toward the slow moving herd, grazing on the\nwheat stubble, moving southward as they grazed.\n\n“Where have you come from this time?” Presley had asked. “Where have you\nkept yourself?”\n\nThe other swept the horizon to the south and east with a vague gesture.\n\n“Off there, down to the south, very far off. So many places that I can't\nremember. I went the Long Trail this time; a long, long ways. Arizona,\nThe Mexicos, and, then, afterwards, Utah and Nevada, following the\nhorizon, travelling at hazard. Into Arizona first, going in by Monument\nPass, and then on to the south, through the country of the Navajos, down\nby the Aga Thia Needle--a great blade of red rock jutting from out the\ndesert, like a knife thrust. Then on and on through The Mexicos, all\nthrough the Southwest, then back again in a great circle by Chihuahua\nand Aldama to Laredo, to Torreon, and Albuquerque. From there across\nthe Uncompahgre plateau into the Uintah country; then at last due west\nthrough Nevada to California and to the valley of the San Joaquin.” His\nvoice lapsed to a monotone, his eyes becoming fixed; he continued to\nspeak as though half awake, his thoughts elsewhere, seeing again in the\neye of his mind the reach of desert and red hill, the purple mountain,\nthe level stretch of alkali, leper white, all the savage, gorgeous\ndesolation of the Long Trail.\n\nHe ignored Presley for the moment, but, on the other hand, Presley\nhimself gave him but half his attention. The return of Vanamee had\nstimulated the poet's memory. He recalled the incidents of Vanamee's\nlife, reviewing again that terrible drama which had uprooted his soul,\nwhich had driven him forth a wanderer, a shunner of men, a sojourner in\nwaste places. He was, strangely enough, a college graduate and a man of\nwide reading and great intelligence, but he had chosen to lead his own\nlife, which was that of a recluse.\n\nOf a temperament similar in many ways to Presley's, there were\ncapabilities in Vanamee that were not ordinarily to be found in the\nrank and file of men. Living close to nature, a poet by instinct, where\nPresley was but a poet by training, there developed in him a great\nsensitiveness to beauty and an almost abnormal capacity for great\nhappiness and great sorrow; he felt things intensely, deeply. He never\nforgot. It was when he was eighteen or nineteen, at the formative and\nmost impressionable period of his life, that he had met Angele Varian.\nPresley barely remembered her as a girl of sixteen, beautiful almost\nbeyond expression, who lived with an aged aunt on the Seed ranch back of\nthe Mission. At this moment he was trying to recall how she looked, with\nher hair of gold hanging in two straight plaits on either side of her\nface, making three-cornered her round, white forehead; her wonderful\neyes, violet blue, heavy lidded, with their astonishing upward slant\ntoward the temples, the slant that gave a strange, oriental cast to her\nface, perplexing, enchanting. He remembered the Egyptian fulness of the\nlips, the strange balancing movement of her head upon her slender neck,\nthe same movement that one sees in a snake at poise. Never had he seen a\ngirl more radiantly beautiful, never a beauty so strange, so troublous,\nso out of all accepted standards. It was small wonder that Vanamee had\nloved her, and less wonder, still, that his love had been so intense, so\npassionate, so part of himself. Angele had loved him with a love no\nless than his own. It was one of those legendary passions that sometimes\noccur, idyllic, untouched by civilisation, spontaneous as the growth of\ntrees, natural as dew-fall, strong as the firm-seated mountains.\n\nAt the time of his meeting with Angele, Vanamee was living on the Los\nMuertos ranch. It was there he had chosen to spend one of his college\nvacations. But he preferred to pass it in out-of-door work, sometimes\nherding cattle, sometimes pitching hay, sometimes working with pick\nand dynamite-stick on the ditches in the fourth division of the ranch,\nriding the range, mending breaks in the wire fences, making himself\ngenerally useful. College bred though he was, the life pleased him. He\nwas, as he desired, close to nature, living the full measure of life, a\nworker among workers, taking enjoyment in simple pleasures, healthy in\nmind and body. He believed in an existence passed in this fashion in the\ncountry, working hard, eating full, drinking deep, sleeping dreamlessly.\n\nBut every night, after supper, he saddled his pony and rode over to the\ngarden of the old Mission. The 'dobe dividing wall on that side, which\nonce had separated the Mission garden and the Seed ranch, had long since\ncrumbled away, and the boundary between the two pieces of ground was\nmarked only by a line of venerable pear trees. Here, under these trees,\nhe found Angele awaiting him, and there the two would sit through the\nhot, still evening, their arms about each other, watching the moon\nrise over the foothills, listening to the trickle of the water in the\nmoss-encrusted fountain in the garden, and the steady croak of the great\nfrogs that lived in the damp north corner of the enclosure. Through all\none summer the enchantment of that new-found, wonderful love, pure and\nuntainted, filled the lives of each of them with its sweetness. The\nsummer passed, the harvest moon came and went. The nights were very\ndark. In the deep shade of the pear trees they could no longer see each\nother. When they met at the rendezvous, Vanamee found her only with his\ngroping hands. They did not speak, mere words were useless between them.\nSilently as his reaching hands touched her warm body, he took her in his\narms, searching for her lips with his. Then one night the tragedy had\nsuddenly leaped from out the shadow with the abruptness of an explosion.\n\nIt was impossible afterwards to reconstruct the manner of its\noccurrence. To Angele's mind--what there was left of it--the matter\nalways remained a hideous blur, a blot, a vague, terrible confusion.\nNo doubt they two had been watched; the plan succeeded too well for any\nother supposition. One moonless night, Angele, arriving under the\nblack shadow of the pear trees a little earlier than usual, found the\napparently familiar figure waiting for her. All unsuspecting she gave\nherself to the embrace of a strange pair of arms, and Vanamee arriving\nbut a score of moments later, stumbled over her prostrate body, inert\nand unconscious, in the shadow of the overspiring trees.\n\nWho was the Other? Angele was carried to her home on the Seed ranch,\ndelirious, all but raving, and Vanamee, with knife and revolver ready,\nranged the country-side like a wolf. He was not alone. The whole county\nrose, raging, horror-struck. Posse after posse was formed, sent out, and\nreturned, without so much as a clue. Upon no one could even the shadow\nof suspicion be thrown. The Other had withdrawn into an impenetrable\nmystery. There he remained. He never was found; he never was so much\nas heard of. A legend arose about him, this prowler of the night, this\nstrange, fearful figure, with an unseen face, swooping in there from\nout the darkness, come and gone in an instant, but leaving behind him a\ntrack of terror and death and rage and undying grief. Within the year,\nin giving birth to the child, Angele had died.\n\nThe little babe was taken by Angele's parents, and Angele was buried\nin the Mission garden near to the aged, grey sun dial. Vanamee stood by\nduring the ceremony, but half conscious of what was going forward. At\nthe last moment he had stepped forward, looked long into the dead face\nframed in its plaits of gold hair, the hair that made three-cornered\nthe round, white forehead; looked again at the closed eyes, with their\nperplexing upward slant toward the temples, oriental, bizarre; at the\nlips with their Egyptian fulness; at the sweet, slender neck; the long,\nslim hands; then abruptly turned about. The last clods were filling the\ngrave at a time when he was already far away, his horse's head turned\ntoward the desert.\n\nFor two years no syllable was heard of him. It was believed that he had\nkilled himself. But Vanamee had no thought of that. For two years he\nwandered through Arizona, living in the desert, in the wilderness, a\nrecluse, a nomad, an ascetic. But, doubtless, all his heart was in the\nlittle coffin in the Mission garden. Once in so often he must come\nback thither. One day he was seen again in the San Joaquin. The priest,\nFather Sarria, returning from a visit to the sick at Bonneville, met him\non the Upper Road. Eighteen years had passed since Angele had died, but\nthe thread of Vanamee's life had been snapped. Nothing remained now\nbut the tangled ends. He had never forgotten. The long, dull ache, the\npoignant grief had now become a part of him. Presley knew this to be so.\n\nWhile Presley had been reflecting upon all this, Vanamee had continued\nto speak. Presley, however, had not been wholly inattentive. While\nhis memory was busy reconstructing the details of the drama of the\nshepherd's life, another part of his brain had been swiftly registering\npicture after picture that Vanamee's monotonous flow of words struck\noff, as it were, upon a steadily moving scroll. The music of the\nunfamiliar names that occurred in his recital was a stimulant to the\npoet's imagination. Presley had the poet's passion for expressive,\nsonorous names. As these came and went in Vanamee's monotonous\nundertones, like little notes of harmony in a musical progression, he\nlistened, delighted with their resonance.--Navajo, Quijotoa, Uintah,\nSonora, Laredo, Uncompahgre--to him they were so many symbols. It was\nhis West that passed, unrolling there before the eye of his mind:\nthe open, heat-scourged round of desert; the mesa, like a vast altar,\nshimmering purple in the royal sunset; the still, gigantic mountains,\nheaving into the sky from out the canyons; the strenuous, fierce life\nof isolated towns, lost and forgotten, down there, far off, below the\nhorizon. Abruptly his great poem, his Song of the West, leaped up again\nin his imagination. For the moment, he all but held it. It was there,\nclose at hand. In another instant he would grasp it.\n\n“Yes, yes,” he exclaimed, “I can see it all. The desert, the mountains,\nall wild, primordial, untamed. How I should have loved to have been with\nyou. Then, perhaps, I should have got hold of my idea.”\n\n“Your idea?”\n\n“The great poem of the West. It's that which I want to write. Oh, to\nput it all into hexameters; strike the great iron note; sing the vast,\nterrible song; the song of the People; the forerunners of empire!”\n\nVanamee understood him perfectly. He nodded gravely.\n\n“Yes, it is there. It is Life, the primitive, simple, direct Life,\npassionate, tumultuous. Yes, there is an epic there.”\n\nPresley caught at the word. It had never before occurred to him.\n\n“Epic, yes, that's it. It is the epic I'm searching for. And HOW I\nsearch for it. You don't know. It is sometimes almost an agony. Often\nand often I can feel it right there, there, at my finger-tips, but I\nnever quite catch it. It always eludes me. I was born too late. Ah, to\nget back to that first clear-eyed view of things, to see as Homer saw,\nas Beowulf saw, as the Nibelungen poets saw. The life is here, the same\nas then; the Poem is here; my West is here; the primeval, epic life\nis here, here under our hands, in the desert, in the mountain, on the\nranch, all over here, from Winnipeg to Guadalupe. It is the man who is\nlacking, the poet; we have been educated away from it all. We are out of\ntouch. We are out of tune.”\n\nVanamee heard him to the end, his grave, sad face thoughtful and\nattentive. Then he rose.\n\n“I am going over to the Mission,” he said, “to see Father Sarria. I have\nnot seen him yet.”\n\n“How about the sheep?”\n\n“The dogs will keep them in hand, and I shall not be gone long. Besides\nthat, I have a boy here to help. He is over yonder on the other side of\nthe herd. We can't see him from here.”\n\nPresley wondered at the heedlessness of leaving the sheep so slightly\nguarded, but made no comment, and the two started off across the field\nin the direction of the Mission church.\n\n“Well, yes, it is there--your epic,” observed Vanamee, as they went\nalong. “But why write? Why not LIVE in it? Steep oneself in the heat of\nthe desert, the glory of the sunset, the blue haze of the mesa and the\ncanyon.”\n\n“As you have done, for instance?”\n\nVanamee nodded.\n\n“No, I could not do that,” declared Presley; “I want to go back, but not\nso far as you. I feel that I must compromise. I must find expression.\nI could not lose myself like that in your desert. When its vastness\noverwhelmed me, or its beauty dazzled me, or its loneliness weighed down\nupon me, I should have to record my impressions. Otherwise, I should\nsuffocate.”\n\n“Each to his own life,” observed Vanamee.\n\nThe Mission of San Juan, built of brown 'dobe blocks, covered with\nyellow plaster, that at many points had dropped away from the walls,\nstood on the crest of a low rise of the ground, facing to the south. A\ncovered colonnade, paved with round, worn bricks, from whence opened the\ndoors of the abandoned cells, once used by the monks, adjoined it on the\nleft. The roof was of tiled half-cylinders, split longitudinally, and\nlaid in alternate rows, now concave, now convex. The main body of the\nchurch itself was at right angles to the colonnade, and at the point of\nintersection rose the belfry tower, an ancient campanile, where swung\nthe three cracked bells, the gift of the King of Spain. Beyond the\nchurch was the Mission garden and the graveyard that overlooked the Seed\nranch in a little hollow beyond.\n\nPresley and Vanamee went down the long colonnade to the last door next\nthe belfry tower, and Vanamee pulled the leather thong that hung from\na hole in the door, setting a little bell jangling somewhere in the\ninterior. The place, but for this noise, was shrouded in a Sunday\nstillness, an absolute repose. Only at intervals, one heard the trickle\nof the unseen fountain, and the liquid cooing of doves in the garden.\n\nFather Sarria opened the door. He was a small man, somewhat stout, with\na smooth and shiny face. He wore a frock coat that was rather dirty,\nslippers, and an old yachting cap of blue cloth, with a broken leather\nvizor. He was smoking a cheap cigar, very fat and black.\n\nBut instantly he recognised Vanamee. His face went all alight with\npleasure and astonishment. It seemed as if he would never have finished\nshaking both his hands; and, as it was, he released but one of them,\npatting him affectionately on the shoulder with the other. He was\nvoluble in his welcome, talking partly in Spanish, partly in English. So\nhe had come back again, this great fellow, tanned as an Indian, lean as\nan Indian, with an Indian's long, black hair. But he had not changed,\nnot in the very least. His beard had not grown an inch. Aha! The rascal,\nnever to give warning, to drop down, as it were, from out the sky. Such\na hermit! To live in the desert! A veritable Saint Jerome. Did a lion\nfeed him down there in Arizona, or was it a raven, like Elijah? The good\nGod had not fattened him, at any rate, and, apropos, he was just about\nto dine himself. He had made a salad from his own lettuce. The two would\ndine with him, eh? For this, my son, that was lost is found again.\n\nBut Presley excused himself. Instinctively, he felt that Sarria and\nVanamee wanted to talk of things concerning which he was an outsider. It\nwas not at all unlikely that Vanamee would spend half the night before\nthe high altar in the church.\n\nHe took himself away, his mind still busy with Vanamee's extraordinary\nlife and character. But, as he descended the hill, he was startled by\na prolonged and raucous cry, discordant, very harsh, thrice repeated at\nexact intervals, and, looking up, he saw one of Father Sarria's peacocks\nbalancing himself upon the topmost wire of the fence, his long tail\ntrailing, his neck outstretched, filling the air with his stupid outcry,\nfor no reason than the desire to make a noise.\n\nAbout an hour later, toward four in the afternoon, Presley reached the\nspring at the head of the little canyon in the northeast corner of the\nQuien Sabe ranch, the point toward which he had been travelling since\nearly in the forenoon. The place was not without its charm. Innumerable\nlive-oaks overhung the canyon, and Broderson Creek--there a mere\nrivulet, running down from the spring--gave a certain coolness to the\nair. It was one of the few spots thereabouts that had survived the\ndry season of the last year. Nearly all the other springs had dried\ncompletely, while Mission Creek on Derrick's ranch was nothing better\nthan a dusty cutting in the ground, filled with brittle, concave flakes\nof dried and sun-cracked mud.\n\nPresley climbed to the summit of one of the hills--the highest--that\nrose out of the canyon, from the crest of which he could see for thirty,\nfifty, sixty miles down the valley, and, filling his pipe, smoked lazily\nfor upwards of an hour, his head empty of thought, allowing himself to\nsuccumb to a pleasant, gentle inanition, a little drowsy comfortable in\nhis place, prone upon the ground, warmed just enough by such sunlight\nas filtered through the live-oaks, soothed by the good tobacco and the\nprolonged murmur of the spring and creek. By degrees, the sense of his\nown personality became blunted, the little wheels and cogs of thought\nmoved slower and slower; consciousness dwindled to a point, the animal\nin him stretched itself, purring. A delightful numbness invaded his mind\nand his body. He was not asleep, he was not awake, stupefied merely,\nlapsing back to the state of the faun, the satyr.\n\nAfter a while, rousing himself a little, he shifted his position and,\ndrawing from the pocket of his shooting coat his little tree-calf\nedition of the Odyssey, read far into the twenty-first book, where,\nafter the failure of all the suitors to bend Ulysses's bow, it is\nfinally put, with mockery, into his own hands. Abruptly the drama of\nthe story roused him from all his languor. In an instant he was the\npoet again, his nerves tingling, alive to every sensation, responsive\nto every impression. The desire of creation, of composition, grew big\nwithin him. Hexameters of his own clamoured, tumultuous, in his brain.\nNot for a long time had he “felt his poem,” as he called this sensation,\nso poignantly. For an instant he told himself that he actually held it.\n\nIt was, no doubt, Vanamee's talk that had stimulated him to this\npoint. The story of the Long Trail, with its desert and mountain, its\ncliff-dwellers, its Aztec ruins, its colour, movement, and romance,\nfilled his mind with picture after picture. The epic defiled before his\nvision like a pageant. Once more, he shot a glance about him, as if in\nsearch of the inspiration, and this time he all but found it. He rose to\nhis feet, looking out and off below him.\n\nAs from a pinnacle, Presley, from where he now stood, dominated the\nentire country. The sun had begun to set, everything in the range of his\nvision was overlaid with a sheen of gold.\n\nFirst, close at hand, it was the Seed ranch, carpeting the little hollow\nbehind the Mission with a spread of greens, some dark, some vivid,\nsome pale almost to yellowness. Beyond that was the Mission itself,\nits venerable campanile, in whose arches hung the Spanish King's bells,\nalready glowing ruddy in the sunset. Farther on, he could make out\nAnnixter's ranch house, marked by the skeleton-like tower of the\nartesian well, and, a little farther to the east, the huddled, tiled\nroofs of Guadalajara. Far to the west and north, he saw Bonneville very\nplain, and the dome of the courthouse, a purple silhouette against the\nglare of the sky. Other points detached themselves, swimming in a golden\nmist, projecting blue shadows far before them; the mammoth live-oak by\nHooven's, towering superb and magnificent; the line of eucalyptus trees,\nbehind which he knew was the Los Muertos ranch house--his home; the\nwatering-tank, the great iron-hooped tower of wood that stood at the\njoining of the Lower Road and the County Road; the long wind-break of\npoplar trees and the white walls of Caraher's saloon on the County Road.\n\nBut all this seemed to be only foreground, a mere array of\naccessories--a mass of irrelevant details. Beyond Annixter's, beyond\nGuadalajara, beyond the Lower Road, beyond Broderson Creek, on to the\nsouth and west, infinite, illimitable, stretching out there under the\nsheen of the sunset forever and forever, flat, vast, unbroken, a huge\nscroll, unrolling between the horizons, spread the great stretches of\nthe ranch of Los Muertos, bare of crops, shaved close in the recent\nharvest. Near at hand were hills, but on that far southern horizon only\nthe curve of the great earth itself checked the view. Adjoining Los\nMuertos, and widening to the west, opened the Broderson ranch. The\nOsterman ranch to the northwest carried on the great sweep of landscape;\nranch after ranch. Then, as the imagination itself expanded under the\nstimulus of that measureless range of vision, even those great ranches\nresolved themselves into mere foreground, mere accessories, irrelevant\ndetails. Beyond the fine line of the horizons, over the curve of the\nglobe, the shoulder of the earth, were other ranches, equally vast, and\nbeyond these, others, and beyond these, still others, the immensities\nmultiplying, lengthening out vaster and vaster. The whole gigantic\nsweep of the San Joaquin expanded, Titanic, before the eye of the mind,\nflagellated with heat, quivering and shimmering under the sun's red eye.\nAt long intervals, a faint breath of wind out of the south passed slowly\nover the levels of the baked and empty earth, accentuating the silence,\nmarking off the stillness. It seemed to exhale from the land itself, a\nprolonged sigh as of deep fatigue. It was the season after the harvest,\nand the great earth, the mother, after its period of reproduction, its\npains of labour, delivered of the fruit of its loins, slept the sleep\nof exhaustion, the infinite repose of the colossus, benignant, eternal,\nstrong, the nourisher of nations, the feeder of an entire world. Ha!\nthere it was, his epic, his inspiration, his West, his thundering\nprogression of hexameters. A sudden uplift, a sense of exhilaration, of\nphysical exaltation appeared abruptly to sweep Presley from his feet. As\nfrom a point high above the world, he seemed to dominate a universe, a\nwhole order of things. He was dizzied, stunned, stupefied, his morbid\nsupersensitive mind reeling, drunk with the intoxication of mere\nimmensity. Stupendous ideas for which there were no names drove headlong\nthrough his brain. Terrible, formless shapes, vague figures, gigantic,\nmonstrous, distorted, whirled at a gallop through his imagination.\n\nHe started homeward, still in his dream, descending from the hill,\nemerging from the canyon, and took the short cut straight across the\nQuien Sabe ranch, leaving Guadalajara far to his left. He tramped\nsteadily on through the wheat stubble, walking fast, his head in a\nwhirl.\n\nNever had he so nearly grasped his inspiration as at that moment on the\nhilltop. Even now, though the sunset was fading, though the wide reach\nof valley was shut from sight, it still kept him company. Now the\ndetails came thronging back--the component parts of his poem, the signs\nand symbols of the West. It was there, close at hand, he had been in\ntouch with it all day. It was in the centenarian's vividly coloured\nreminiscences--De La Cuesta, holding his grant from the Spanish crown,\nwith his power of life and death; the romance of his marriage; the white\nhorse with its pillion of red leather and silver bridle mountings; the\nbull-fights in the Plaza; the gifts of gold dust, and horses and tallow.\nIt was in Vanamee's strange history, the tragedy of his love; Angele\nVarian, with her marvellous loveliness; the Egyptian fulness of her\nlips, the perplexing upward slant of her violet eyes, bizarre, oriental;\nher white forehead made three cornered by her plaits of gold hair; the\nmystery of the Other; her death at the moment of her child's birth.\nIt was in Vanamee's flight into the wilderness; the story of the Long\nTrail, the sunsets behind the altar-like mesas, the baking desolation of\nthe deserts; the strenuous, fierce life of forgotten towns, down there,\nfar off, lost below the horizons of the southwest; the sonorous music of\nunfamiliar names--Quijotoa, Uintah, Sonora, Laredo, Uncompahgre. It\nwas in the Mission, with its cracked bells, its decaying walls, its\nvenerable sun dial, its fountain and old garden, and in the Mission\nFathers themselves, the priests, the padres, planting the first wheat\nand oil and wine to produce the elements of the Sacrament--a trinity of\ngreat industries, taking their rise in a religious rite.\n\nAbruptly, as if in confirmation, Presley heard the sound of a bell from\nthe direction of the Mission itself. It was the de Profundis, a note\nof the Old World; of the ancient regime, an echo from the hillsides\nof mediaeval Europe, sounding there in this new land, unfamiliar and\nstrange at this end-of-the-century time.\n\nBy now, however, it was dark. Presley hurried forward. He came to the\nline fence of the Quien Sabe ranch. Everything was very still. The stars\nwere all out. There was not a sound other than the de Profundis, still\nsounding from very far away. At long intervals the great earth sighed\ndreamily in its sleep. All about, the feeling of absolute peace\nand quiet and security and untroubled happiness and content seemed\ndescending from the stars like a benediction. The beauty of his poem,\nits idyl, came to him like a caress; that alone had been lacking. It was\nthat, perhaps, which had left it hitherto incomplete. At last he was\nto grasp his song in all its entity. But suddenly there was an\ninterruption. Presley had climbed the fence at the limit of the\nQuien Sabe ranch. Beyond was Los Muertos, but between the two ran the\nrailroad. He had only time to jump back upon the embankment when, with\na quivering of all the earth, a locomotive, single, unattached, shot\nby him with a roar, filling the air with the reek of hot oil, vomiting\nsmoke and sparks; its enormous eye, cyclopean, red, throwing a glare far\nin advance, shooting by in a sudden crash of confused thunder; filling\nthe night with the terrific clamour of its iron hoofs.\n\nAbruptly Presley remembered. This must be the crack passenger engine\nof which Dyke had told him, the one delayed by the accident on the\nBakersfield division and for whose passage the track had been opened all\nthe way to Fresno.\n\nBefore Presley could recover from the shock of the irruption, while the\nearth was still vibrating, the rails still humming, the engine was far\naway, flinging the echo of its frantic gallop over all the valley. For a\nbrief instant it roared with a hollow diapason on the Long Trestle over\nBroderson Creek, then plunged into a cutting farther on, the quivering\nglare of its fires losing itself in the night, its thunder abruptly\ndiminishing to a subdued and distant humming. All at once this ceased.\nThe engine was gone.\n\nBut the moment the noise of the engine lapsed, Presley--about to start\nforward again--was conscious of a confusion of lamentable sounds that\nrose into the night from out the engine's wake. Prolonged cries of\nagony, sobbing wails of infinite pain, heart-rending, pitiful.\n\nThe noises came from a little distance. He ran down the track, crossing\nthe culvert, over the irrigating ditch, and at the head of the long\nreach of track--between the culvert and the Long Trestle--paused\nabruptly, held immovable at the sight of the ground and rails all about\nhim.\n\nIn some way, the herd of sheep--Vanamee's herd--had found a breach in\nthe wire fence by the right of way and had wandered out upon the tracks.\nA band had been crossing just at the moment of the engine's passage. The\npathos of it was beyond expression. It was a slaughter, a massacre of\ninnocents. The iron monster had charged full into the midst, merciless,\ninexorable. To the right and left, all the width of the right of way,\nthe little bodies had been flung; backs were snapped against the fence\nposts; brains knocked out. Caught in the barbs of the wire, wedged in,\nthe bodies hung suspended. Under foot it was terrible. The black blood,\nwinking in the starlight, seeped down into the clinkers between the ties\nwith a prolonged sucking murmur.\n\nPresley turned away, horror-struck, sick at heart, overwhelmed with a\nquick burst of irresistible compassion for this brute agony he could not\nrelieve. The sweetness was gone from the evening, the sense of peace,\nof security, and placid contentment was stricken from the landscape. The\nhideous ruin in the engine's path drove all thought of his poem from his\nmind. The inspiration vanished like a mist. The de Profundis had ceased\nto ring.\n\nHe hurried on across the Los Muertos ranch, almost running, even putting\nhis hands over his ears till he was out of hearing distance of that\nall but human distress. Not until he was beyond ear-shot did he pause,\nlooking back, listening. The night had shut down again. For a moment the\nsilence was profound, unbroken.\n\nThen, faint and prolonged, across the levels of the ranch, he heard the\nengine whistling for Bonneville. Again and again, at rapid intervals in\nits flying course, it whistled for road crossings, for sharp curves, for\ntrestles; ominous notes, hoarse, bellowing, ringing with the accents of\nmenace and defiance; and abruptly Presley saw again, in his imagination,\nthe galloping monster, the terror of steel and steam, with its single\neye, cyclopean, red, shooting from horizon to horizon; but saw it now\nas the symbol of a vast power, huge, terrible, flinging the echo of\nits thunder over all the reaches of the valley, leaving blood and\ndestruction in its path; the leviathan, with tentacles of steel\nclutching into the soil, the soulless Force, the iron-hearted Power, the\nmonster, the Colossus, the Octopus.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nOn the following morning, Harran Derrick was up and about by a little\nafter six o'clock, and a quarter of an hour later had breakfast in the\nkitchen of the ranch house, preferring not to wait until the Chinese\ncook laid the table in the regular dining-room. He scented a hard\nday's work ahead of him, and was anxious to be at it betimes. He was\npractically the manager of Los Muertos, and, with the aid of his foreman\nand three division superintendents, carried forward nearly the entire\ndirection of the ranch, occupying himself with the details of his\nfather's plans, executing his orders, signing contracts, paying bills,\nand keeping the books.\n\nFor the last three weeks little had been done. The crop--such as\nit was--had been harvested and sold, and there had been a general\nrelaxation of activity for upwards of a month. Now, however, the fall\nwas coming on, the dry season was about at its end; any time after the\ntwentieth of the month the first rains might be expected, softening the\nground, putting it into condition for the plough. Two days before this,\nHarran had notified his superintendents on Three and Four to send in\nsuch grain as they had reserved for seed. On Two the wheat had not even\nshown itself above the ground, while on One, the Home ranch, which was\nunder his own immediate supervision, the seed had already been graded\nand selected.\n\nIt was Harran's intention to commence blue-stoning his seed that day, a\ndelicate and important process which prevented rust and smut appearing\nin the crop when the wheat should come up. But, furthermore, he wanted\nto find time to go to Guadalajara to meet the Governor on the morning\ntrain. His day promised to be busy.\n\nBut as Harran was finishing his last cup of coffee, Phelps, the foreman\non the Home ranch, who also looked after the storage barns where the\nseed was kept, presented himself, cap in hand, on the back porch by the\nkitchen door.\n\n“I thought I'd speak to you about the seed from Four, sir,” he said.\n“That hasn't been brought in yet.”\n\nHarran nodded.\n\n“I'll see about it. You've got all the blue-stone you want, have you,\nPhelps?” and without waiting for an answer he added, “Tell the stableman\nI shall want the team about nine o'clock to go to Guadalajara. Put them\nin the buggy. The bays, you understand.” When the other had gone,\nHarran drank off the rest of his coffee, and, rising, passed through the\ndining-room and across a stone-paved hallway with a glass roof into the\noffice just beyond.\n\nThe office was the nerve-centre of the entire ten thousand acres of\nLos Muertos, but its appearance and furnishings were not in the least\nsuggestive of a farm. It was divided at about its middle by a wire\nrailing, painted green and gold, and behind this railing were the\nhigh desks where the books were kept, the safe, the letter-press and\nletter-files, and Harran's typewriting machine. A great map of Los\nMuertos with every water-course, depression, and elevation, together\nwith indications of the varying depths of the clays and loams in the\nsoil, accurately plotted, hung against the wall between the windows,\nwhile near at hand by the safe was the telephone.\n\nBut, no doubt, the most significant object in the office was the\nticker. This was an innovation in the San Joaquin, an idea of shrewd,\nquick-witted young Annixter, which Harran and Magnus Derrick had been\nquick to adopt, and after them Broderson and Osterman, and many others\nof the wheat growers of the county. The offices of the ranches were\nthus connected by wire with San Francisco, and through that city with\nMinneapolis, Duluth, Chicago, New York, and at last, and most important\nof all, with Liverpool. Fluctuations in the price of the world's crop\nduring and after the harvest thrilled straight to the office of Los\nMuertos, to that of the Quien Sabe, to Osterman's, and to Broderson's.\nDuring a flurry in the Chicago wheat pits in the August of that year,\nwhich had affected even the San Francisco market, Harran and Magnus had\nsat up nearly half of one night watching the strip of white tape jerking\nunsteadily from the reel. At such moments they no longer felt their\nindividuality. The ranch became merely the part of an enormous whole,\na unit in the vast agglomeration of wheat land the whole world round,\nfeeling the effects of causes thousands of miles distant--a drought on\nthe prairies of Dakota, a rain on the plains of India, a frost on the\nRussian steppes, a hot wind on the llanos of the Argentine.\n\nHarran crossed over to the telephone and rang six bells, the call for\nthe division house on Four. It was the most distant, the most isolated\npoint on all the ranch, situated at its far southeastern extremity,\nwhere few people ever went, close to the line fence, a dot, a speck,\nlost in the immensity of the open country. By the road it was eleven\nmiles distant from the office, and by the trail to Hooven's and the\nLower Road all of nine.\n\n“How about that seed?” demanded Harran when he had got Cutter on the\nline.\n\nThe other made excuses for an unavoidable delay, and was adding that he\nwas on the point of starting out, when Harran cut in with:\n\n“You had better go the trail. It will save a little time and I am in\na hurry. Put your sacks on the horses' backs. And, Cutter, if you see\nHooven when you go by his place, tell him I want him, and, by the way,\ntake a look at the end of the irrigating ditch when you get to it. See\nhow they are getting along there and if Billy wants anything. Tell him\nwe are expecting those new scoops down to-morrow or next day and to get\nalong with what he has until then.... How's everything on Four? ...\nAll right, then. Give your seed to Phelps when you get here if I am not\nabout. I am going to Guadalajara to meet the Governor. He's coming down\nto-day. And that makes me think; we lost the case, you know. I had a\nletter from the Governor yesterday.... Yes, hard luck. S. Behrman did\nus up. Well, good-bye, and don't lose any time with that seed. I want to\nblue-stone to-day.”\n\nAfter telephoning Cutter, Harran put on his hat, went over to the barns,\nand found Phelps. Phelps had already cleaned out the vat which was to\ncontain the solution of blue-stone, and was now at work regrading the\nseed. Against the wall behind him ranged the row of sacks. Harran cut\nthe fastenings of these and examined the contents carefully, taking\nhandfuls of wheat from each and allowing it to run through his fingers,\nor nipping the grains between his nails, testing their hardness.\n\nThe seed was all of the white varieties of wheat and of a very high\ngrade, the berries hard and heavy, rigid and swollen with starch.\n\n“If it was all like that, sir, hey?” observed Phelps.\n\nHarran put his chin in the air.\n\n“Bread would be as good as cake, then,” he answered, going from sack\nto sack, inspecting the contents and consulting the tags affixed to the\nmouths.\n\n“Hello,” he remarked, “here's a red wheat. Where did this come from?”\n\n“That's that red Clawson we sowed to the piece on Four, north the\nMission Creek, just to see how it would do here. We didn't get a very\ngood catch.”\n\n“We can't do better than to stay by White Sonora and Propo,” remarked\nHarran. “We've got our best results with that, and European millers like\nit to mix with the Eastern wheats that have more gluten than ours. That\nis, if we have any wheat at all next year.”\n\nA feeling of discouragement for the moment bore down heavily upon him.\nAt intervals this came to him and for the moment it was overpowering.\nThe idea of “what's-the-use” was upon occasion a veritable oppression.\nEverything seemed to combine to lower the price of wheat. The extension\nof wheat areas always exceeded increase of population; competition was\ngrowing fiercer every year. The farmer's profits were the object of\nattack from a score of different quarters. It was a flock of vultures\ndescending upon a common prey--the commission merchant, the elevator\ncombine, the mixing-house ring, the banks, the warehouse men, the\nlabouring man, and, above all, the railroad. Steadily the Liverpool\nbuyers cut and cut and cut. Everything, every element of the world's\nmarkets, tended to force down the price to the lowest possible figure at\nwhich it could be profitably farmed. Now it was down to eighty-seven.\nIt was at that figure the crop had sold that year; and to think that the\nGovernor had seen wheat at two dollars and five cents in the year of the\nTurko-Russian War!\n\nHe turned back to the house after giving Phelps final directions,\ngloomy, disheartened, his hands deep in his pockets, wondering what was\nto be the outcome. So narrow had the margin of profit shrunk that a\ndry season meant bankruptcy to the smaller farmers throughout all the\nvalley. He knew very well how widespread had been the distress the last\ntwo years. With their own tenants on Los Muertos, affairs had reached\nthe stage of desperation. Derrick had practically been obliged to\n“carry” Hooven and some of the others. The Governor himself had made\nalmost nothing during the last season; a third year like the last, with\nthe price steadily sagging, meant nothing else but ruin.\n\nBut here he checked himself. Two consecutive dry seasons in California\nwere almost unprecedented; a third would be beyond belief, and the\ncomplete rest for nearly all the land was a compensation. They had\nmade no money, that was true; but they had lost none. Thank God, the\nhomestead was free of mortgage; one good season would more than make up\nthe difference.\n\nHe was in a better mood by the time he reached the driveway that led up\nto the ranch house, and as he raised his eyes toward the house itself,\nhe could not but feel that the sight of his home was cheering. The ranch\nhouse was set in a great grove of eucalyptus, oak, and cypress, enormous\ntrees growing from out a lawn that was as green, as fresh, and as\nwell-groomed as any in a garden in the city. This lawn flanked all one\nside of the house, and it was on this side that the family elected to\nspend most of its time. The other side, looking out upon the Home ranch\ntoward Bonneville and the railroad, was but little used. A deep porch\nran the whole length of the house here, and in the lower branches of a\nlive-oak near the steps Harran had built a little summer house for his\nmother. To the left of the ranch house itself, toward the County Road,\nwas the bunk-house and kitchen for some of the hands. From the steps of\nthe porch the view to the southward expanded to infinity. There was not\nso much as a twig to obstruct the view. In one leap the eye reached\nthe fine, delicate line where earth and sky met, miles away. The flat\nmonotony of the land, clean of fencing, was broken by one spot only, the\nroof of the Division Superintendent's house on Three--a mere speck, just\ndarker than the ground. Cutter's house on Four was not even in sight.\nThat was below the horizon.\n\nAs Harran came up he saw his mother at breakfast. The table had been set\non the porch and Mrs. Derrick, stirring her coffee with one hand, held\nopen with the other the pages of Walter Pater's “Marius.” At her feet,\nPrincess Nathalie, the white Angora cat, sleek, over-fed, self-centred,\nsat on her haunches, industriously licking at the white fur of her\nbreast, while near at hand, by the railing of the porch, Presley\npottered with a new bicycle lamp, filling it with oil, adjusting the\nwicks.\n\nHarran kissed his mother and sat down in a wicker chair on the porch,\nremoving his hat, running his fingers through his yellow hair.\n\nMagnus Derrick's wife looked hardly old enough to be the mother of two\nsuch big fellows as Harran and Lyman Derrick. She was not far into the\nfifties, and her brown hair still retained much of its brightness. She\ncould yet be called pretty. Her eyes were large and easily assumed a\nlook of inquiry and innocence, such as one might expect to see in a\nyoung girl. By disposition she was retiring; she easily obliterated\nherself. She was not made for the harshness of the world, and yet she\nhad known these harshnesses in her younger days. Magnus had married her\nwhen she was twenty-one years old, at a time when she was a graduate\nof some years' standing from the State Normal School and was teaching\nliterature, music, and penmanship in a seminary in the town of\nMarysville. She overworked herself here continually, loathing the strain\nof teaching, yet clinging to it with a tenacity born of the knowledge\nthat it was her only means of support. Both her parents were dead; she\nwas dependent upon herself. Her one ambition was to see Italy and\nthe Bay of Naples. The “Marble Faun,” Raphael's “Madonnas” and “Il\nTrovatore” were her beau ideals of literature and art. She dreamed of\nItaly, Rome, Naples, and the world's great “art-centres.” There was no\ndoubt that her affair with Magnus had been a love-match, but Annie Payne\nwould have loved any man who would have taken her out of the droning,\nheart-breaking routine of the class and music room. She had followed his\nfortunes unquestioningly. First at Sacramento, during the turmoil of\nhis political career, later on at Placerville in El Dorado County, after\nDerrick had interested himself in the Corpus Christi group of mines, and\nfinally at Los Muertos, where, after selling out his fourth interest\nin Corpus Christi, he had turned rancher and had “come in” on the new\ntracts of wheat land just thrown open by the railroad. She had lived\nhere now for nearly ten years. But never for one moment since the time\nher glance first lost itself in the unbroken immensity of the ranches\nhad she known a moment's content. Continually there came into her\npretty, wide-open eyes--the eyes of a young doe--a look of uneasiness,\nof distrust, and aversion. Los Muertos frightened her. She remembered\nthe days of her young girlhood passed on a farm in eastern Ohio--five\nhundred acres, neatly partitioned into the water lot, the cow pasture,\nthe corn lot, the barley field, and wheat farm; cosey, comfortable,\nhome-like; where the farmers loved their land, caressing it, coaxing it,\nnourishing it as though it were a thing almost conscious; where the seed\nwas sown by hand, and a single two-horse plough was sufficient for the\nentire farm; where the scythe sufficed to cut the harvest and the grain\nwas thrashed with flails.\n\nBut this new order of things--a ranch bounded only by the horizons,\nwhere, as far as one could see, to the north, to the east, to the south\nand to the west, was all one holding, a principality ruled with iron and\nsteam, bullied into a yield of three hundred and fifty thousand bushels,\nwhere even when the land was resting, unploughed, unharrowed, and\nunsown, the wheat came up--troubled her, and even at times filled her\nwith an undefinable terror. To her mind there was something inordinate\nabout it all; something almost unnatural. The direct brutality of ten\nthousand acres of wheat, nothing but wheat as far as the eye could see,\nstunned her a little. The one-time writing-teacher of a young ladies'\nseminary, with her pretty deer-like eyes and delicate fingers, shrank\nfrom it. She did not want to look at so much wheat. There was something\nvaguely indecent in the sight, this food of the people, this elemental\nforce, this basic energy, weltering here under the sun in all the\nunconscious nakedness of a sprawling, primordial Titan.\n\nThe monotony of the ranch ate into her heart hour by hour, year by year.\nAnd with it all, when was she to see Rome, Italy, and the Bay of Naples?\nIt was a different prospect truly. Magnus had given her his promise\nthat once the ranch was well established, they two should travel. But\ncontinually he had been obliged to put her off, now for one reason, now\nfor another; the machine would not as yet run of itself, he must still\nfeel his hand upon the lever; next year, perhaps, when wheat should go\nto ninety, or the rains were good. She did not insist. She obliterated\nherself, only allowing, from time to time, her pretty, questioning eyes\nto meet his. In the meantime she retired within herself. She surrounded\nherself with books. Her taste was of the delicacy of point lace. She\nknew her Austin Dobson by heart. She read poems, essays, the ideas\nof the seminary at Marysville persisting in her mind. “Marius the\nEpicurean,” “The Essays of Elia,” “Sesame and Lilies,” “The Stones of\nVenice,” and the little toy magazines, full of the flaccid banalities of\nthe “Minor Poets,” were continually in her hands.\n\nWhen Presley had appeared on Los Muertos, she had welcomed his arrival\nwith delight. Here at last was a congenial spirit. She looked forward\nto long conversations with the young man on literature, art, and ethics.\nBut Presley had disappointed her. That he--outside of his few chosen\ndeities--should care little for literature, shocked her beyond words.\nHis indifference to “style,” to elegant English, was a positive affront.\nHis savage abuse and open ridicule of the neatly phrased rondeaux and\nsestinas and chansonettes of the little magazines was to her mind\na wanton and uncalled-for cruelty. She found his Homer, with its\nslaughters and hecatombs and barbaric feastings and headstrong passions,\nviolent and coarse. She could not see with him any romance, any poetry\nin the life around her; she looked to Italy for that. His “Song of the\nWest,” which only once, incoherent and fierce, he had tried to explain\nto her, its swift, tumultous life, its truth, its nobility and savagery,\nits heroism and obscenity had revolted her.\n\n“But, Presley,” she had murmured, “that is not literature.”\n\n“No,” he had cried between his teeth, “no, thank God, it is not.”\n\nA little later, one of the stablemen brought the buggy with the team of\nbays up to the steps of the porch, and Harran, putting on a different\ncoat and a black hat, took himself off to Guadalajara. The morning was\nfine; there was no cloud in the sky, but as Harran's buggy drew away\nfrom the grove of trees about the ranch house, emerging into the open\ncountry on either side of the Lower Road, he caught himself looking\nsharply at the sky and the faint line of hills beyond the Quien Sabe\nranch. There was a certain indefinite cast to the landscape that to\nHarran's eye was not to be mistaken. Rain, the first of the season, was\nnot far off.\n\n“That's good,” he muttered, touching the bays with the whip, “we can't\nget our ploughs to hand any too soon.”\n\nThese ploughs Magnus Derrick had ordered from an Eastern manufacturer\nsome months before, since he was dissatisfied with the results obtained\nfrom the ones he had used hitherto, which were of local make. However,\nthere had been exasperating and unexpected delays in their shipment.\nMagnus and Harran both had counted upon having the ploughs in their\nimplement barns that very week, but a tracer sent after them had only\nresulted in locating them, still en route, somewhere between The Needles\nand Bakersfield. Now there was likelihood of rain within the week.\nPloughing could be undertaken immediately afterward, so soon as the\nground was softened, but there was a fair chance that the ranch would\nlie idle for want of proper machinery.\n\nIt was ten minutes before train time when Harran reached the depot at\nGuadalajara. The San Francisco papers of the preceding day had arrived\non an earlier train. He bought a couple from the station agent and\nlooked them over till a distant and prolonged whistle announced the\napproach of the down train.\n\nIn one of the four passengers that alighted from the train, he\nrecognised his father. He half rose in his seat, whistling shrilly\nbetween his teeth, waving his hand, and Magnus Derrick, catching sight\nof him, came forward quickly.\n\nMagnus--the Governor--was all of six feet tall, and though now well\ntoward his sixtieth year, was as erect as an officer of cavalry. He was\nbroad in proportion, a fine commanding figure, imposing an immediate\nrespect, impressing one with a sense of gravity, of dignity and a\ncertain pride of race. He was smooth-shaven, thin-lipped, with a\nbroad chin, and a prominent hawk-like nose--the characteristic of\nthe family--thin, with a high bridge, such as one sees in the later\nportraits of the Duke of Wellington. His hair was thick and iron-grey,\nand had a tendency to curl in a forward direction just in front of his\nears. He wore a top-hat of grey, with a wide brim, and a frock coat, and\ncarried a cane with a yellowed ivory head.\n\nAs a young man it had been his ambition to represent his native\nState--North Carolina--in the United States Senate. Calhoun was his\n“great man,” but in two successive campaigns he had been defeated.\nHis career checked in this direction, he had come to California in the\nfifties. He had known and had been the intimate friend of such men as\nTerry, Broderick, General Baker, Lick, Alvarado, Emerich, Larkin, and,\nabove all, of the unfortunate and misunderstood Ralston. Once he had\nbeen put forward as the Democratic candidate for governor, but failed\nof election. After this Magnus had definitely abandoned politics and had\ninvested all his money in the Corpus Christi mines. Then he had sold\nout his interest at a small profit--just in time to miss his chance of\nbecoming a multi-millionaire in the Comstock boom--and was looking\nfor reinvestments in other lines when the news that “wheat had been\ndiscovered in California” was passed from mouth to mouth. Practically\nit amounted to a discovery. Dr. Glenn's first harvest of wheat in\nColusa County, quietly undertaken but suddenly realised with dramatic\nabruptness, gave a new matter for reflection to the thinking men of the\nNew West. California suddenly leaped unheralded into the world's market\nas a competitor in wheat production. In a few years her output of wheat\nexceeded the value of her out-put of gold, and when, later on, the\nPacific and Southwestern Railroad threw open to settlers the rich lands\nof Tulare County--conceded to the corporation by the government as a\nbonus for the construction of the road--Magnus had been quick to seize\nthe opportunity and had taken up the ten thousand acres of Los Muertos.\nWherever he had gone, Magnus had taken his family with him. Lyman had\nbeen born at Sacramento during the turmoil and excitement of Derrick's\ncampaign for governor, and Harran at Shingle Springs, in El Dorado\nCounty, six years later.\n\nBut Magnus was in every sense the “prominent man.” In whatever circle he\nmoved he was the chief figure. Instinctively other men looked to him\nas the leader. He himself was proud of this distinction; he assumed the\ngrand manner very easily and carried it well. As a public speaker he was\none of the last of the followers of the old school of orators. He even\ncarried the diction and manner of the rostrum into private life. It was\nsaid of him that his most colloquial conversation could be taken down\nin shorthand and read off as an admirable specimen of pure, well-chosen\nEnglish. He loved to do things upon a grand scale, to preside, to\ndominate. In his good humour there was something Jovian. When angry,\neverybody around him trembled. But he had not the genius for detail,\nwas not patient. The certain grandiose lavishness of his disposition\noccupied itself more with results than with means. He was always ready\nto take chances, to hazard everything on the hopes of colossal returns.\nIn the mining days at Placerville there was no more redoubtable poker\nplayer in the county. He had been as lucky in his mines as in his\ngambling, sinking shafts and tunnelling in violation of expert theory\nand finding “pay” in every case. Without knowing it, he allowed himself\nto work his ranch much as if he was still working his mine. The\nold-time spirit of '49, hap-hazard, unscientific, persisted in his mind.\nEverything was a gamble--who took the greatest chances was most apt to\nbe the greatest winner. The idea of manuring Los Muertos, of husbanding\nhis great resources, he would have scouted as niggardly, Hebraic,\nungenerous.\n\nMagnus climbed into the buggy, helping himself with Harran's\noutstretched hand which he still held. The two were immensely fond\nof each other, proud of each other. They were constantly together and\nMagnus kept no secrets from his favourite son.\n\n“Well, boy.”\n\n“Well, Governor.”\n\n“I am very pleased you came yourself, Harran. I feared that you might be\ntoo busy and send Phelps. It was thoughtful.”\n\nHarran was about to reply, but at that moment Magnus caught sight of the\nthree flat cars loaded with bright-painted farming machines which still\nremained on the siding above the station. He laid his hands on the reins\nand Harran checked the team.\n\n“Harran,” observed Magnus, fixing the machinery with a judicial frown,\n“Harran, those look singularly like our ploughs. Drive over, boy.”\n\nThe train had by this time gone on its way and Harran brought the team\nup to the siding.\n\n“Ah, I was right,” said the Governor. “'Magnus Derrick, Los Muertos,\nBonneville, from Ditson & Co., Rochester.' These are ours, boy.”\n\nHarran breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\n“At last,” he answered, “and just in time, too. We'll have rain before\nthe week is out. I think, now that I am here, I will telephone Phelps to\nsend the wagon right down for these. I started blue-stoning to-day.”\n\nMagnus nodded a grave approval.\n\n“That was shrewd, boy. As to the rain, I think you are well informed; we\nwill have an early season. The ploughs have arrived at a happy moment.”\n\n“It means money to us, Governor,” remarked Harran.\n\nBut as he turned the horses to allow his father to get into the buggy\nagain, the two were surprised to hear a thick, throaty voice wishing\nthem good-morning, and turning about were aware of S. Behrman, who had\ncome up while they were examining the ploughs. Harran's eyes flashed\non the instant and through his nostrils he drew a sharp, quick breath,\nwhile a certain rigour of carriage stiffened the set of Magnus Derrick's\nshoulders and back. Magnus had not yet got into the buggy, but stood\nwith the team between him and S. Behrman, eyeing him calmly across the\nhorses' backs. S. Behrman came around to the other side of the buggy and\nfaced Magnus.\n\nHe was a large, fat man, with a great stomach; his cheek and the upper\npart of his thick neck ran together to form a great tremulous jowl,\nshaven and blue-grey in colour; a roll of fat, sprinkled with sparse\nhair, moist with perspiration, protruded over the back of his collar.\nHe wore a heavy black moustache. On his head was a round-topped hat of\nstiff brown straw, highly varnished. A light-brown linen vest, stamped\nwith innumerable interlocked horseshoes, covered his protuberant\nstomach, upon which a heavy watch chain of hollow links rose and fell\nwith his difficult breathing, clinking against the vest buttons of\nimitation mother-of-pearl.\n\nS. Behrman was the banker of Bonneville. But besides this he was many\nother things. He was a real estate agent. He bought grain; he dealt in\nmortgages. He was one of the local political bosses, but more important\nthan all this, he was the representative of the Pacific and Southwestern\nRailroad in that section of Tulare County. The railroad did little\nbusiness in that part of the country that S. Behrman did not supervise,\nfrom the consignment of a shipment of wheat to the management of a\ndamage suit, or even to the repair and maintenance of the right of\nway. During the time when the ranchers of the county were fighting the\ngrain-rate case, S. Behrman had been much in evidence in and about\nthe San Francisco court rooms and the lobby of the legislature in\nSacramento. He had returned to Bonneville only recently, a decision\nadverse to the ranchers being foreseen. The position he occupied on\nthe salary list of the Pacific and Southwestern could not readily be\ndefined, for he was neither freight agent, passenger agent, attorney,\nreal-estate broker, nor political servant, though his influence in all\nthese offices was undoubted and enormous. But for all that, the ranchers\nabout Bonneville knew whom to look to as a source of trouble. There was\nno denying the fact that for Osterman, Broderson, Annixter and Derrick,\nS. Behrman was the railroad.\n\n“Mr. Derrick, good-morning,” he cried as he came up. “Good-morning,\nHarran. Glad to see you back, Mr. Derrick.” He held out a thick hand.\n\nMagnus, head and shoulders above the other, tall, thin, erect, looked\ndown upon S. Behrman, inclining his head, failing to see his extended\nhand.\n\n“Good-morning, sir,” he observed, and waited for S. Behrman's further\nspeech.\n\n“Well, Mr. Derrick,” continued S. Behrman, wiping the back of his neck\nwith his handkerchief, “I saw in the city papers yesterday that our case\nhad gone against you.”\n\n“I guess it wasn't any great news to YOU,” commented Harran, his face\nscarlet. “I guess you knew which way Ulsteen was going to jump after\nyour very first interview with him. You don't like to be surprised in\nthis sort of thing, S. Behrman.”\n\n“Now, you know better than that, Harran,” remonstrated S. Behrman\nblandly. “I know what you mean to imply, but I ain't going to let it\nmake me get mad. I wanted to say to your Governor--I wanted to say to\nyou, Mr. Derrick--as one man to another--letting alone for the minute\nthat we were on opposite sides of the case--that I'm sorry you didn't\nwin. Your side made a good fight, but it was in a mistaken cause. That's\nthe whole trouble. Why, you could have figured out before you ever went\ninto the case that such rates are confiscation of property. You must\nallow us--must allow the railroad--a fair interest on the investment.\nYou don't want us to go into the receiver's hands, do you now, Mr.\nDerrick?”\n\n“The Board of Railroad Commissioners was bought,” remarked Magnus\nsharply, a keen, brisk flash glinting in his eye.\n\n“It was part of the game,” put in Harran, “for the Railroad Commission\nto cut rates to a ridiculous figure, far below a REASONABLE figure, just\nso that it WOULD be confiscation. Whether Ulsteen is a tool of yours or\nnot, he had to put the rates back to what they were originally.”\n\n“If you enforced those rates, Mr. Harran,” returned S. Behrman calmly,\n“we wouldn't be able to earn sufficient money to meet operating\nexpenses or fixed charges, to say nothing of a surplus left over to pay\ndividends----”\n\n“Tell me when the P. and S. W. ever paid dividends.”\n\n“The lowest rates,” continued S. Behrman, “that the legislature\ncan establish must be such as will secure us a fair interest on our\ninvestment.”\n\n“Well, what's your standard? Come, let's hear it. Who is to say what's a\nfair rate? The railroad has its own notions of fairness sometimes.”\n\n“The laws of the State,” returned S. Behrman, “fix the rate of interest\nat seven per cent. That's a good enough standard for us. There is no\nreason, Mr. Harran, why a dollar invested in a railroad should not earn\nas much as a dollar represented by a promissory note--seven per cent.\nBy applying your schedule of rates we would not earn a cent; we would be\nbankrupt.”\n\n“Interest on your investment!” cried Harran, furious. “It's fine to talk\nabout fair interest. I know and you know that the total earnings of the\nP. and S. W.--their main, branch and leased lines for last year--was\nbetween nineteen and twenty millions of dollars. Do you mean to say that\ntwenty million dollars is seven per cent. of the original cost of the\nroad?”\n\nS. Behrman spread out his hands, smiling.\n\n“That was the gross, not the net figure--and how can you tell what was\nthe original cost of the road?” “Ah, that's just it,” shouted Harran,\nemphasising each word with a blow of his fist upon his knee, his eyes\nsparkling, “you take cursed good care that we don't know anything about\nthe original cost of the road. But we know you are bonded for treble\nyour value; and we know this: that the road COULD have been built\nfor fifty-four thousand dollars per mile and that you SAY it cost you\neighty-seven thousand. It makes a difference, S. Behrman, on which of\nthese two figures you are basing your seven per cent.”\n\n“That all may show obstinacy, Harran,” observed S. Behrman vaguely, “but\nit don't show common sense.”\n\n“We are threshing out old straw, I believe, gentlemen,” remarked Magnus.\n“The question was thoroughly sifted in the courts.”\n\n“Quite right,” assented S. Behrman. “The best way is that the railroad\nand the farmer understand each other and get along peaceably. We are\nboth dependent on each other. Your ploughs, I believe, Mr. Derrick.” S.\nBehrman nodded toward the flat cars.\n\n“They are consigned to me,” admitted Magnus.\n\n“It looks a trifle like rain,” observed S. Behrman, easing his neck and\njowl in his limp collar. “I suppose you will want to begin ploughing\nnext week.”\n\n“Possibly,” said Magnus.\n\n“I'll see that your ploughs are hurried through for you then, Mr.\nDerrick. We will route them by fast freight for you and it won't cost\nyou anything extra.”\n\n“What do you mean?” demanded Harran. “The ploughs are here. We have\nnothing more to do with the railroad. I am going to have my wagons down\nhere this afternoon.”\n\n“I am sorry,” answered S. Behrman, “but the cars are going north,\nnot, as you thought, coming FROM the north. They have not been to San\nFrancisco yet.”\n\nMagnus made a slight movement of the head as one who remembers a fact\nhitherto forgotten. But Harran was as yet unenlightened.\n\n“To San Francisco!” he answered, “we want them here--what are you\ntalking about?”\n\n“Well, you know, of course, the regulations,” answered S. Behrman.\n“Freight of this kind coming from the Eastern points into the State must\ngo first to one of our common points and be reshipped from there.”\n\nHarran did remember now, but never before had the matter so struck\nhome. He leaned back in his seat in dumb amazement for the instant.\nEven Magnus had turned a little pale. Then, abruptly, Harran broke out\nviolent and raging.\n\n“What next? My God, why don't you break into our houses at night? Why\ndon't you steal the watch out of my pocket, steal the horses out of the\nharness, hold us up with a shot-gun; yes, 'stand and deliver; your money\nor your life.' Here we bring our ploughs from the East over your lines,\nbut you're not content with your long-haul rate between Eastern points\nand Bonneville. You want to get us under your ruinous short-haul rate\nbetween Bonneville and San Francisco, AND RETURN. Think of it! Here's a\nload of stuff for Bonneville that can't stop at Bonneville, where it\nis consigned, but has got to go up to San Francisco first BY WAY OF\nBonneville, at forty cents per ton and then be reshipped from San\nFrancisco back to Bonneville again at FIFTY-ONE cents per ton, the\nshort-haul rate. And we have to pay it all or go without. Here are the\nploughs right here, in sight of the land they have got to be used\non, the season just ready for them, and we can't touch them. Oh,” he\nexclaimed in deep disgust, “isn't it a pretty mess! Isn't it a farce!\nthe whole dirty business!”\n\nS. Behrman listened to him unmoved, his little eyes blinking under his\nfat forehead, the gold chain of hollow links clicking against the pearl\nbuttons of his waistcoat as he breathed.\n\n“It don't do any good to let loose like that, Harran,” he said at\nlength. “I am willing to do what I can for you. I'll hurry the ploughs\nthrough, but I can't change the freight regulation of the road.”\n\n“What's your blackmail for this?” vociferated Harran. “How much do you\nwant to let us go? How much have we got to pay you to be ALLOWED to use\nour own ploughs--what's your figure? Come, spit it out.”\n\n“I see you are trying to make me angry, Harran,” returned S. Behrman,\n“but you won't succeed. Better give up trying, my boy. As I said, the\nbest way is to have the railroad and the farmer get along amicably. It\nis the only way we can do business. Well, s'long, Governor, I must trot\nalong. S'long, Harran.” He took himself off.\n\nBut before leaving Guadalajara Magnus dropped into the town's small\ngrocery store to purchase a box of cigars of a certain Mexican brand,\nunprocurable elsewhere. Harran remained in the buggy.\n\nWhile he waited, Dyke appeared at the end of the street, and, seeing\nDerrick's younger son, came over to shake hands with him. He explained\nhis affair with the P. and S. W., and asked the young man what he\nthought of the expected rise in the price of hops.\n\n“Hops ought to be a good thing,” Harran told him. “The crop in Germany\nand in New York has been a dead failure for the last three years, and\nso many people have gone out of the business that there's likely to be a\nshortage and a stiff advance in the price. They ought to go to a dollar\nnext year. Sure, hops ought to be a good thing. How's the old lady and\nSidney, Dyke?”\n\n“Why, fairly well, thank you, Harran. They're up to Sacramento just now\nto see my brother. I was thinking of going in with my brother into this\nhop business. But I had a letter from him this morning. He may not be\nable to meet me on this proposition. He's got other business on hand. If\nhe pulls out--and he probably will--I'll have to go it alone, but I'll\nhave to borrow. I had thought with his money and mine we would have\nenough to pull off the affair without mortgaging anything. As it is, I\nguess I'll have to see S. Behrman.”\n\n“I'll be cursed if I would!” exclaimed Harran.\n\n“Well, S. Behrman is a screw,” admitted the engineer, “and he is\n'railroad' to his boots; but business is business, and he would have to\nstand by a contract in black and white, and this chance in hops is too\ngood to let slide. I guess we'll try it on, Harran. I can get a good\nforeman that knows all about hops just now, and if the deal pays--well,\nI want to send Sid to a seminary up in San Francisco.”\n\n“Well, mortgage the crops, but don't mortgage the homestead, Dyke,” said\nHarran. “And, by the way, have you looked up the freight rates on hops?”\n\n“No, I haven't yet,” answered Dyke, “and I had better be sure of that,\nhadn't I? I hear that the rate is reasonable, though.”\n\n“You be sure to have a clear understanding with the railroad first about\nthe rate,” Harran warned him.\n\nWhen Magnus came out of the grocery store and once more seated himself\nin the buggy, he said to Harran, “Boy, drive over here to Annixter's\nbefore we start home. I want to ask him to dine with us to-night.\nOsterman and Broderson are to drop in, I believe, and I should like to\nhave Annixter as well.”\n\nMagnus was lavishly hospitable. Los Muertos's doors invariably stood\nopen to all the Derricks' neighbours, and once in so often Magnus had a\nfew of his intimates to dinner.\n\nAs Harran and his father drove along the road toward Annixter's ranch\nhouse, Magnus asked about what had happened during his absence.\n\nHe inquired after his wife and the ranch, commenting upon the work on\nthe irrigating ditch. Harran gave him the news of the past week, Dyke's\ndischarge, his resolve to raise a crop of hops; Vanamee's return, the\nkilling of the sheep, and Hooven's petition to remain upon the ranch as\nMagnus's tenant. It needed only Harran's recommendation that the German\nshould remain to have Magnus consent upon the instant. “You know more\nabout it than I, boy,” he said, “and whatever you think is wise shall be\ndone.”\n\nHarran touched the bays with the whip, urging them to their briskest\npace. They were not yet at Annixter's and he was anxious to get back to\nthe ranch house to supervise the blue-stoning of his seed.\n\n“By the way, Governor,” he demanded suddenly, “how is Lyman getting on?”\n\nLyman, Magnus's eldest son, had never taken kindly toward ranch life. He\nresembled his mother more than he did Magnus, and had inherited from her\na distaste for agriculture and a tendency toward a profession. At a time\nwhen Harran was learning the rudiments of farming, Lyman was entering\nthe State University, and, graduating thence, had spent three years\nin the study of law. But later on, traits that were particularly his\nfather's developed. Politics interested him. He told himself he was\na born politician, was diplomatic, approachable, had a talent for\nintrigue, a gift of making friends easily and, most indispensable of\nall, a veritable genius for putting influential men under obligations to\nhimself. Already he had succeeded in gaining for himself two important\noffices in the municipal administration of San Francisco--where he\nhad his home--sheriff's attorney, and, later on, assistant district\nattorney. But with these small achievements he was by no means\nsatisfied. The largeness of his father's character, modified in Lyman\nby a counter-influence of selfishness, had produced in him an inordinate\nambition. Where his father during his political career had considered\nhimself only as an exponent of principles he strove to apply, Lyman saw\nbut the office, his own personal aggrandisement. He belonged to the new\nschool, wherein objects were attained not by orations before senates\nand assemblies, but by sessions of committees, caucuses, compromises\nand expedients. His goal was to be in fact what Magnus was only in\nname--governor. Lyman, with shut teeth, had resolved that some day he\nwould sit in the gubernatorial chair in Sacramento.\n\n“Lyman is doing well,” answered Magnus. “I could wish he was more\npronounced in his convictions, less willing to compromise, but I believe\nhim to be earnest and to have a talent for government and civics. His\nambition does him credit, and if he occupied himself a little more with\nmeans and a little less with ends, he would, I am sure, be the ideal\nservant of the people. But I am not afraid. The time will come when the\nState will be proud of him.”\n\nAs Harran turned the team into the driveway that led up to Annixter's\nhouse, Magnus remarked:\n\n“Harran, isn't that young Annixter himself on the porch?”\n\nHarran nodded and remarked:\n\n“By the way, Governor, I wouldn't seem too cordial in your invitation to\nAnnixter. He will be glad to come, I know, but if you seem to want him\ntoo much, it is just like his confounded obstinacy to make objections.”\n\n“There is something in that,” observed Magnus, as Harran drew up at the\nporch of the house. “He is a queer, cross-grained fellow, but in many\nways sterling.”\n\nAnnixter was lying in the hammock on the porch, precisely as Presley\nhad found him the day before, reading “David Copperfield” and stuffing\nhimself with dried prunes. When he recognised Magnus, however, he got\nup, though careful to give evidence of the most poignant discomfort. He\nexplained his difficulty at great length, protesting that his stomach\nwas no better than a spongebag. Would Magnus and Harran get down and\nhave a drink? There was whiskey somewhere about.\n\nMagnus, however, declined. He stated his errand, asking Annixter to come\nover to Los Muertos that evening for seven o'clock dinner. Osterman and\nBroderson would be there.\n\nAt once Annixter, even to Harran's surprise, put his chin in the\nair, making excuses, fearing to compromise himself if he accepted too\nreadily. No, he did not think he could get around--was sure of it, in\nfact. There were certain businesses he had on hand that evening. He had\npractically made an appointment with a man at Bonneville; then, too,\nhe was thinking of going up to San Francisco to-morrow and needed his\nsleep; would go to bed early; and besides all that, he was a very sick\nman; his stomach was out of whack; if he moved about it brought the\ngripes back. No, they must get along without him.\n\nMagnus, knowing with whom he had to deal, did not urge the point, being\nconvinced that Annixter would argue over the affair the rest of the\nmorning. He re-settled himself in the buggy and Harran gathered up the\nreins.\n\n“Well,” he observed, “you know your business best. Come if you can. We\ndine at seven.”\n\n“I hear you are going to farm the whole of Los Muertos this season,”\n remarked Annixter, with a certain note of challenge in his voice.\n\n“We are thinking of it,” replied Magnus.\n\nAnnixter grunted scornfully.\n\n“Did you get the message I sent you by Presley?” he began.\n\nTactless, blunt, and direct, Annixter was quite capable of calling even\nMagnus a fool to his face. But before he could proceed, S. Behrman in\nhis single buggy turned into the gate, and driving leisurely up to the\nporch halted on the other side of Magnus's team.\n\n“Good-morning, gentlemen,” he remarked, nodding to the two Derricks as\nthough he had not seen them earlier in the day. “Mr. Annixter, how do\nyou do?”\n\n“What in hell do YOU want?” demanded Annixter with a stare.\n\nS. Behrman hiccoughed slightly and passed a fat hand over his waistcoat.\n\n“Why, not very much, Mr. Annixter,” he replied, ignoring the\nbelligerency in the young ranchman's voice, “but I will have to lodge\na protest against you, Mr. Annixter, in the matter of keeping your line\nfence in repair. The sheep were all over the track last night, this\nside the Long Trestle, and I am afraid they have seriously disturbed our\nballast along there. We--the railroad--can't fence along our right of\nway. The farmers have the prescriptive right of that, so we have to look\nto you to keep your fence in repair. I am sorry, but I shall have to\nprotest----” Annixter returned to the hammock and stretched himself out\nin it to his full length, remarking tranquilly:\n\n“Go to the devil!”\n\n“It is as much to your interest as to ours that the safety of the\npublic----”\n\n“You heard what I said. Go to the devil!”\n\n“That all may show obstinacy, Mr. Annixter, but----”\n\nSuddenly Annixter jumped up again and came to the edge of the porch; his\nface flamed scarlet to the roots of his stiff yellow hair. He thrust out\nhis jaw aggressively, clenching his teeth.\n\n“You,” he vociferated, “I'll tell you what you are. You're a--a--a PIP!”\n\nTo his mind it was the last insult, the most outrageous calumny. He had\nno worse epithet at his command.\n\n“----may show obstinacy,” pursued S. Behrman, bent upon finishing the\nphrase, “but it don't show common sense.”\n\n“I'll mend my fence, and then, again, maybe I won't mend my fence,”\n shouted Annixter. “I know what you mean--that wild engine last night.\nWell, you've no right to run at that speed in the town limits.”\n\n“How the town limits? The sheep were this side the Long Trestle.”\n\n“Well, that's in the town limits of Guadalajara.” “Why, Mr. Annixter,\nthe Long Trestle is a good two miles out of Guadalajara.”\n\nAnnixter squared himself, leaping to the chance of an argument.\n\n“Two miles! It's not a mile and a quarter. No, it's not a mile. I'll\nleave it to Magnus here.”\n\n“Oh, I know nothing about it,” declared Magnus, refusing to be involved.\n\n“Yes, you do. Yes, you do, too. Any fool knows how far it is from\nGuadalajara to the Long Trestle. It's about five-eighths of a mile.”\n\n“From the depot of the town,” remarked S. Behrman placidly, “to the head\nof the Long Trestle is about two miles.”\n\n“That's a lie and you know it's a lie,” shouted the other, furious at\nS. Behrman's calmness, “and I can prove it's a lie. I've walked that\ndistance on the Upper Road, and I know just how fast I walk, and if I\ncan walk four miles in one hour.”\n\nMagnus and Harran drove on, leaving Annixter trying to draw S. Behrman\ninto a wrangle.\n\nWhen at length S. Behrman as well took himself away, Annixter returned\nto his hammock, finished the rest of his prunes and read another chapter\nof “Copperfield.” Then he put the book, open, over his face and went to\nsleep.\n\nAn hour later, toward noon, his own terrific snoring woke him up\nsuddenly, and he sat up, rubbing his face and blinking at the sunlight.\nThere was a bad taste in his mouth from sleeping with it wide open, and\ngoing into the dining-room of the house, he mixed himself a drink of\nwhiskey and soda and swallowed it in three great gulps. He told himself\nthat he felt not only better but hungry, and pressed an electric button\nin the wall near the sideboard three times to let the kitchen--situated\nin a separate building near the ranch house--know that he was ready for\nhis dinner. As he did so, an idea occurred to him. He wondered if Hilma\nTree would bring up his dinner and wait on the table while he ate it.\n\nIn connection with his ranch, Annixter ran a dairy farm on a very small\nscale, making just enough butter and cheese for the consumption of the\nranch's PERSONNEL. Old man Tree, his wife, and his daughter Hilma looked\nafter the dairy. But there was not always work enough to keep the three\nof them occupied and Hilma at times made herself useful in other ways.\nAs often as not she lent a hand in the kitchen, and two or three times\na week she took her mother's place in looking after Annixter's house,\nmaking the beds, putting his room to rights, bringing his meals up\nfrom the kitchen. For the last summer she had been away visiting with\nrelatives in one of the towns on the coast. But the week previous to\nthis she had returned and Annixter had come upon her suddenly one day\nin the dairy, making cheese, the sleeves of her crisp blue shirt waist\nrolled back to her very shoulders. Annixter had carried away with him a\nclear-cut recollection of these smooth white arms of hers, bare to the\nshoulder, very round and cool and fresh. He would not have believed that\na girl so young should have had arms so big and perfect. To his surprise\nhe found himself thinking of her after he had gone to bed that night,\nand in the morning when he woke he was bothered to know whether he had\ndreamed about Hilma's fine white arms over night. Then abruptly he\nhad lost patience with himself for being so occupied with the subject,\nraging and furious with all the breed of feemales--a fine way for a\nman to waste his time. He had had his experience with the timid little\ncreature in the glove-cleaning establishment in Sacramento. That was\nenough. Feemales! Rot! None of them in HIS, thank you. HE had seen Hilma\nTree give him a look in the dairy. Aha, he saw through her! She was\ntrying to get a hold on him, was she? He would show her. Wait till\nhe saw her again. He would send her about her business in a hurry. He\nresolved upon a terrible demeanour in the presence of the dairy girl--a\ngreat show of indifference, a fierce masculine nonchalance; and when,\nthe next morning, she brought him his breakfast, he had been smitten\ndumb as soon as she entered the room, glueing his eyes upon his\nplate, his elbows close to his side, awkward, clumsy, overwhelmed with\nconstraint.\n\nWhile true to his convictions as a woman-hater and genuinely despising\nHilma both as a girl and as an inferior, the idea of her worried him.\nMost of all, he was angry with himself because of his inane sheepishness\nwhen she was about. He at first had told himself that he was a fool not\nto be able to ignore her existence as hitherto, and then that he was a\ngreater fool not to take advantage of his position. Certainly he had not\nthe remotest idea of any affection, but Hilma was a fine looking girl.\nHe imagined an affair with her.\n\nAs he reflected upon the matter now, scowling abstractedly at the button\nof the electric bell, turning the whole business over in his mind, he\nremembered that to-day was butter-making day and that Mrs. Tree would\nbe occupied in the dairy. That meant that Hilma would take her place. He\nturned to the mirror of the sideboard, scrutinising his reflection with\ngrim disfavour. After a moment, rubbing the roughened surface of his\nchin the wrong way, he muttered to his image in the glass:\n\n“That a mug! Good Lord! what a looking mug!” Then, after a moment's\nsilence, “Wonder if that fool feemale will be up here to-day.”\n\nHe crossed over into his bedroom and peeped around the edge of the\nlowered curtain. The window looked out upon the skeleton-like tower of\nthe artesian well and the cook-house and dairy-house close beside it. As\nhe watched, he saw Hilma come out from the cook-house and hurry across\ntoward the kitchen. Evidently, she was going to see about his dinner.\nBut as she passed by the artesian well, she met young Delaney, one of\nAnnixter's hands, coming up the trail by the irrigating ditch, leading\nhis horse toward the stables, a great coil of barbed wire in his gloved\nhands and a pair of nippers thrust into his belt. No doubt, he had been\nmending the break in the line fence by the Long Trestle. Annixter saw\nhim take off his wide-brimmed hat as he met Hilma, and the two stood\nthere for some moments talking together. Annixter even heard Hilma\nlaughing very gayly at something Delaney was saying. She patted his\nhorse's neck affectionately, and Delaney, drawing the nippers from his\nbelt, made as if to pinch her arm with them. She caught at his wrist\nand pushed him away, laughing again. To Annixter's mind the pair seemed\nastonishingly intimate. Brusquely his anger flamed up.\n\nAh, that was it, was it? Delaney and Hilma had an understanding between\nthemselves. They carried on their affair right out there in the open,\nunder his very eyes. It was absolutely disgusting. Had they no sense\nof decency, those two? Well, this ended it. He would stop that sort of\nthing short off; none of that on HIS ranch if he knew it. No, sir. He\nwould pack that girl off before he was a day older. He wouldn't have\nthat kind about the place. Not much! She'd have to get out. He would\ntalk to old man Tree about it this afternoon. Whatever happened, HE\ninsisted upon morality.\n\n“And my dinner!” he suddenly exclaimed. “I've got to wait and go\nhungry--and maybe get sick again--while they carry on their disgusting\nlove-making.”\n\nHe turned about on the instant, and striding over to the electric bell,\nrang it again with all his might.\n\n“When that feemale gets up here,” he declared, “I'll just find out why\nI've got to wait like this. I'll take her down, to the Queen's taste.\nI'm lenient enough, Lord knows, but I don't propose to be imposed upon\nALL the time.”\n\nA few moments later, while Annixter was pretending to read the county\nnewspaper by the window in the dining-room, Hilma came in to set the\ntable. At the time Annixter had his feet cocked on the window ledge and\nwas smoking a cigar, but as soon as she entered the room he--without\npremeditation--brought his feet down to the floor and crushed out the\nlighted tip of his cigar under the window ledge. Over the top of the\npaper he glanced at her covertly from time to time.\n\nThough Hilma was only nineteen years old, she was a large girl with\nall the development of a much older woman. There was a certain generous\namplitude to the full, round curves of her hips and shoulders that\nsuggested the precocious maturity of a healthy, vigorous animal life\npassed under the hot southern sun of a half-tropical country. She\nwas, one knew at a glance, warm-blooded, full-blooded, with an even,\ncomfortable balance of temperament. Her neck was thick, and sloped to\nher shoulders, with full, beautiful curves, and under her chin and\nunder her ears the flesh was as white and smooth as floss satin, shading\nexquisitely to a faint delicate brown on her nape at the roots of her\nhair. Her throat rounded to meet her chin and cheek, with a soft swell\nof the skin, tinted pale amber in the shadows, but blending by barely\nperceptible gradations to the sweet, warm flush of her cheek. This\ncolour on her temples was just touched with a certain blueness where\nthe flesh was thin over the fine veining underneath. Her eyes were light\nbrown, and so wide open that on the slightest provocation the full disc\nof the pupil was disclosed; the lids--just a fraction of a shade darker\nthan the hue of her face--were edged with lashes that were almost black.\nWhile these lashes were not long, they were thick and rimmed her eyes\nwith a fine, thin line. Her mouth was rather large, the lips shut\ntight, and nothing could have been more graceful, more charming than the\noutline of these full lips of hers, and her round white chin, modulating\ndownward with a certain delicious roundness to her neck, her throat and\nthe sweet feminine amplitude of her breast. The slightest movement of\nher head and shoulders sent a gentle undulation through all this\nbeauty of soft outlines and smooth surfaces, the delicate amber shadows\ndeepening or fading or losing themselves imperceptibly in the pretty\nrose-colour of her cheeks, or the dark, warm-tinted shadow of her thick\nbrown hair.\n\nHer hair seemed almost to have a life of its own, almost Medusa-like,\nthick, glossy and moist, lying in heavy, sweet-smelling masses over her\nforehead, over her small ears with their pink lobes, and far down upon\nher nape. Deep in between the coils and braids it was of a bitumen\nbrownness, but in the sunlight it vibrated with a sheen like tarnished\ngold.\n\nLike most large girls, her movements were not hurried, and this\nindefinite deliberateness of gesture, this slow grace, this certain ease\nof attitude, was a charm that was all her own.\n\nBut Hilma's greatest charm of all was her simplicity--a simplicity that\nwas not only in the calm regularity of her face, with its statuesque\nevenness of contour, its broad surface of cheek and forehead and the\nmasses of her straight smooth hair, but was apparent as well in the long\nline of her carriage, from her foot to her waist and the single deep\nswell from her waist to her shoulder. Almost unconsciously she dressed\nin harmony with this note of simplicity, and on this occasion wore a\nskirt of plain dark blue calico and a white shirt waist crisp from the\nlaundry.\n\nAnd yet, for all the dignity of this rigourous simplicity, there were\nabout Hilma small contradictory suggestions of feminine daintiness,\ncharming beyond words. Even Annixter could not help noticing that her\nfeet were narrow and slender, and that the little steel buckles of her\nlow shoes were polished bright, and that her fingertips and nails were\nof a fine rosy pink.\n\nHe found himself wondering how it was that a girl in Hilma's position\nshould be able to keep herself so pretty, so trim, so clean and\nfeminine, but he reflected that her work was chiefly in the dairy, and\neven there of the lightest order. She was on the ranch more for the sake\nof being with her parents than from any necessity of employment. Vaguely\nhe seemed to understand that, in that great new land of the West, in the\nopen-air, healthy life of the ranches, where the conditions of earning\na livelihood were of the easiest, refinement among the younger women was\neasily to be found--not the refinement of education, nor culture, but\nthe natural, intuitive refinement of the woman, not as yet defiled and\ncrushed out by the sordid, strenuous life-struggle of over-populated\ndistricts. It was the original, intended and natural delicacy of an\nelemental existence, close to nature, close to life, close to the great,\nkindly earth.\n\nAs Hilma laid the table-spread, her arms opened to their widest reach,\nthe white cloth setting a little glisten of reflected light underneath\nthe chin, Annixter stirred in his place uneasily.\n\n“Oh, it's you, is it, Miss Hilma?” he remarked, for the sake of saying\nsomething. “Good-morning. How do you do?”\n\n“Good-morning, sir,” she answered, looking up, resting for a moment on\nher outspread palms. “I hope you are better.”\n\nHer voice was low in pitch and of a velvety huskiness, seeming to come\nmore from her chest than from her throat.\n\n“Well, I'm some better,” growled Annixter. Then suddenly he demanded,\n“Where's that dog?”\n\nA decrepit Irish setter sometimes made his appearance in and about the\nranch house, sleeping under the bed and eating when anyone about the\nplace thought to give him a plate of bread.\n\nAnnixter had no particular interest in the dog. For weeks at a time he\nignored its existence. It was not his dog. But to-day it seemed as if he\ncould not let the subject rest. For no reason that he could explain even\nto himself, he recurred to it continually. He questioned Hilma minutely\nall about the dog. Who owned him? How old did she think he was? Did she\nimagine the dog was sick? Where had he got to? Maybe he had crawled\noff to die somewhere. He recurred to the subject all through the meal;\napparently, he could talk of nothing else, and as she finally went away\nafter clearing off the table, he went onto the porch and called after\nher:\n\n“Say, Miss Hilma.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“If that dog turns up again you let me know.”\n\n“Very well, sir.”\n\nAnnixter returned to the dining-room and sat down in the chair he had\njust vacated. “To hell with the dog!” he muttered, enraged, he could not\ntell why.\n\nWhen at length he allowed his attention to wander from Hilma Tree, he\nfound that he had been staring fixedly at a thermometer upon the wall\nopposite, and this made him think that it had long been his intention\nto buy a fine barometer, an instrument that could be accurately depended\non. But the barometer suggested the present condition of the weather and\nthe likelihood of rain. In such case, much was to be done in the way of\ngetting the seed ready and overhauling his ploughs and drills. He had\nnot been away from the house in two days. It was time to be up and\ndoing. He determined to put in the afternoon “taking a look around,”\n and have a late supper. He would not go to Los Muertos; he would ignore\nMagnus Derrick's invitation. Possibly, though, it might be well to run\nover and see what was up.\n\n“If I do,” he said to himself, “I'll ride the buckskin.” The buckskin\nwas a half-broken broncho that fought like a fiend under the saddle\nuntil the quirt and spur brought her to her senses. But Annixter\nremembered that the Trees' cottage, next the dairy-house, looked out\nupon the stables, and perhaps Hilma would see him while he was mounting\nthe horse and be impressed with his courage.\n\n“Huh!” grunted Annixter under his breath, “I should like to see that\nfool Delaney try to bust that bronch. That's what I'D like to see.”\n\nHowever, as Annixter stepped from the porch of the ranch house, he was\nsurprised to notice a grey haze over all the sky; the sunlight was\ngone; there was a sense of coolness in the air; the weather-vane on the\nbarn--a fine golden trotting horse with flamboyant mane and tail--was\nveering in a southwest wind. Evidently the expected rain was close at\nhand.\n\nAnnixter crossed over to the stables reflecting that he could ride the\nbuckskin to the Trees' cottage and tell Hilma that he would not be home\nto supper. The conference at Los Muertos would be an admirable excuse\nfor this, and upon the spot he resolved to go over to the Derrick ranch\nhouse, after all.\n\nAs he passed the Trees' cottage, he observed with satisfaction that\nHilma was going to and fro in the front room. If he busted the buckskin\nin the yard before the stable she could not help but see. Annixter found\nthe stableman in the back of the barn greasing the axles of the buggy,\nand ordered him to put the saddle on the buckskin.\n\n“Why, I don't think she's here, sir,” answered the stableman, glancing\ninto the stalls. “No, I remember now. Delaney took her out just after\ndinner. His other horse went lame and he wanted to go down by the Long\nTrestle to mend the fence. He started out, but had to come back.”\n\n“Oh, Delaney got her, did he?”\n\n“Yes, sir. He had a circus with her, but he busted her right enough.\nWhen it comes to horse, Delaney can wipe the eye of any cow-puncher in\nthe county, I guess.”\n\n“He can, can he?” observed Annixter. Then after a silence, “Well, all\nright, Billy; put my saddle on whatever you've got here. I'm going over\nto Los Muertos this afternoon.”\n\n“Want to look out for the rain, Mr. Annixter,” remarked Billy. “Guess\nwe'll have rain before night.”\n\n“I'll take a rubber coat,” answered Annixter. “Bring the horse up to the\nranch house when you're ready.”\n\nAnnixter returned to the house to look for his rubber coat in deep\ndisgust, not permitting himself to glance toward the dairy-house and\nthe Trees' cottage. But as he reached the porch he heard the telephone\nringing his call. It was Presley, who rang up from Los Muertos. He had\nheard from Harran that Annixter was, perhaps, coming over that evening.\nIf he came, would he mind bringing over his--Presley's--bicycle. He had\nleft it at the Quien Sabe ranch the day before and had forgotten to come\nback that way for it.\n\n“Well,” objected Annixter, a surly note in his voice, “I WAS going to\nRIDE over.” “Oh, never mind, then,” returned Presley easily. “I was to\nblame for forgetting it. Don't bother about it. I'll come over some of\nthese days and get it myself.”\n\nAnnixter hung up the transmitter with a vehement wrench and stamped out\nof the room, banging the door. He found his rubber coat hanging in the\nhallway and swung into it with a fierce movement of the shoulders that\nall but started the seams. Everything seemed to conspire to thwart him.\nIt was just like that absent-minded, crazy poet, Presley, to forget his\nwheel. Well, he could come after it himself. He, Annixter, would ride\nSOME horse, anyhow. When he came out upon the porch he saw the wheel\nleaning against the fence where Presley had left it. If it stayed there\nmuch longer the rain would catch it. Annixter ripped out an oath. At\nevery moment his ill-humour was increasing. Yet, for all that, he went\nback to the stable, pushing the bicycle before him, and countermanded\nhis order, directing the stableman to get the buggy ready. He himself\ncarefully stowed Presley's bicycle under the seat, covering it with a\ncouple of empty sacks and a tarpaulin carriage cover.\n\nWhile he was doing this, the stableman uttered an exclamation and paused\nin the act of backing the horse into the shafts, holding up a hand,\nlistening.\n\nFrom the hollow roof of the barn and from the thick velvet-like padding\nof dust over the ground outside, and from among the leaves of the few\nnearby trees and plants there came a vast, monotonous murmur that seemed\nto issue from all quarters of the horizon at once, a prolonged and\nsubdued rustling sound, steady, even, persistent.\n\n“There's your rain,” announced the stableman. “The first of the season.”\n\n“And I got to be out in it,” fumed Annixter, “and I suppose those swine\nwill quit work on the big barn now.”\n\nWhen the buggy was finally ready, he put on his rubber coat, climbed in,\nand without waiting for the stableman to raise the top, drove out into\nthe rain, a new-lit cigar in his teeth. As he passed the dairy-house, he\nsaw Hilma standing in the doorway, holding out her hand to the rain, her\nface turned upward toward the grey sky, amused and interested at this\nfirst shower of the wet season. She was so absorbed that she did not see\nAnnixter, and his clumsy nod in her direction passed unnoticed.\n\n“She did it on purpose,” Annixter told himself, chewing fiercely on his\ncigar. “Cuts me now, hey? Well, this DOES settle it. She leaves this\nranch before I'm a day older.”\n\nHe decided that he would put off his tour of inspection till the next\nday. Travelling in the buggy as he did, he must keep to the road which\nled to Derrick's, in very roundabout fashion, by way of Guadalajara.\nThis rain would reduce the thick dust of the road to two feet of viscid\nmud. It would take him quite three hours to reach the ranch house on Los\nMuertos. He thought of Delaney and the buckskin and ground his teeth.\nAnd all this trouble, if you please, because of a fool feemale girl. A\nfine way for him to waste his time. Well, now he was done with it. His\ndecision was taken now. She should pack.\n\nSteadily the rain increased. There was no wind. The thick veil of\nwet descended straight from sky to earth, blurring distant outlines,\nspreading a vast sheen of grey over all the landscape. Its volume became\ngreater, the prolonged murmuring note took on a deeper tone. At the\ngate to the road which led across Dyke's hop-fields toward Guadalajara,\nAnnixter was obliged to descend and raise the top of the buggy. In doing\nso he caught the flesh of his hand in the joint of the iron elbow that\nsupported the top and pinched it cruelly. It was the last misery, the\nculmination of a long train of wretchedness. On the instant he hated\nHilma Tree so fiercely that his sharply set teeth all but bit his cigar\nin two.\n\nWhile he was grabbing and wrenching at the buggy-top, the water from\nhis hat brim dripping down upon his nose, the horse, restive under the\ndrench of the rain, moved uneasily.\n\n“Yah-h-h you!” he shouted, inarticulate with exasperation.\n“You--you--Gor-r-r, wait till I get hold of you. WHOA, you!”\n\nBut there was an interruption. Delaney, riding the buckskin, came around\na bend in the road at a slow trot and Annixter, getting into the buggy\nagain, found himself face to face with him.\n\n“Why, hello, Mr. Annixter,” said he, pulling up. “Kind of sort of wet,\nisn't it?”\n\nAnnixter, his face suddenly scarlet, sat back in his place abruptly,\nexclaiming:\n\n“Oh--oh, there you are, are you?”\n\n“I've been down there,” explained Delaney, with a motion of his head\ntoward the railroad, “to mend that break in the fence by the Long\nTrestle and I thought while I was about it I'd follow down along the\nfence toward Guadalajara to see if there were any more breaks. But I\nguess it's all right.”\n\n“Oh, you guess it's all right, do you?” observed Annixter through his\nteeth.\n\n“Why--why--yes,” returned the other, bewildered at the truculent ring\nin Annixter's voice. “I mended that break by the Long Trestle just now\nand----\n\n“Well, why didn't you mend it a week ago?” shouted Annixter wrathfully.\n“I've been looking for you all the morning, I have, and who told you you\ncould take that buckskin? And the sheep were all over the right of way\nlast night because of that break, and here that filthy pip, S. Behrman,\ncomes down here this morning and wants to make trouble for me.” Suddenly\nhe cried out, “What do I FEED you for? What do I keep you around here\nfor? Think it's just to fatten up your carcass, hey?”\n\n“Why, Mr. Annixter----” began Delaney.\n\n“And don't TALK to me,” vociferated the other, exciting himself with his\nown noise. “Don't you say a word to me even to apologise. If I've spoken\nto you once about that break, I've spoken fifty times.”\n\n“Why, sir,” declared Delaney, beginning to get indignant, “the sheep did\nit themselves last night.”\n\n“I told you not to TALK to me,” clamoured Annixter.\n\n“But, say, look here----”\n\n“Get off the ranch. You get off the ranch. And taking that buckskin\nagainst my express orders. I won't have your kind about the place,\nnot much. I'm easy-going enough, Lord knows, but I don't propose to be\nimposed on ALL the time. Pack off, you understand and do it lively. Go\nto the foreman and tell him I told him to pay you off and then clear\nout. And, you hear me,” he concluded, with a menacing outthrust of his\nlower jaw, “you hear me, if I catch you hanging around the ranch house\nafter this, or if I so much as see you on Quien Sabe, I'll show you the\nway off of it, my friend, at the toe of my boot. Now, then, get out of\nthe way and let me pass.”\n\nAngry beyond the power of retort, Delaney drove the spurs into the\nbuckskin and passed the buggy in a single bound. Annixter gathered up\nthe reins and drove on muttering to himself, and occasionally looking\nback to observe the buckskin flying toward the ranch house in a\nspattering shower of mud, Delaney urging her on, his head bent down\nagainst the falling rain.\n\n“Huh,” grunted Annixter with grim satisfaction, a certain sense of good\nhumour at length returning to him, “that just about takes the saleratus\nout of YOUR dough, my friend.”\n\nA little farther on, Annixter got out of the buggy a second time to open\nanother gate that let him out upon the Upper Road, not far distant from\nGuadalajara. It was the road that connected that town with Bonneville\nand that ran parallel with the railroad tracks. On the other side of the\ntrack he could see the infinite extension of the brown, bare land of\nLos Muertos, turning now to a soft, moist welter of fertility under\nthe insistent caressing of the rain. The hard, sun-baked clods were\ndecomposing, the crevices between drinking the wet with an eager,\nsucking noise. But the prospect was dreary; the distant horizons were\nblotted under drifting mists of rain; the eternal monotony of the earth\nlay open to the sombre low sky without a single adornment, without a\nsingle variation from its melancholy flatness. Near at hand the wires\nbetween the telegraph poles vibrated with a faint humming under the\nmultitudinous fingering of the myriad of falling drops, striking among\nthem and dripping off steadily from one to another. The poles themselves\nwere dark and swollen and glistening with wet, while the little cones of\nglass on the transverse bars reflected the dull grey light of the end of\nthe afternoon.\n\nAs Annixter was about to drive on, a freight train passed, coming\nfrom Guadalajara, going northward toward Bonneville, Fresno and San\nFrancisco. It was a long train, moving slowly, methodically, with a\nmeasured coughing of its locomotive and a rhythmic cadence of its trucks\nover the interstices of the rails. On two or three of the flat cars near\nits end, Annixter plainly saw Magnus Derrick's ploughs, their bright\ncoating of red and green paint setting a single brilliant note in all\nthis array of grey and brown.\n\nAnnixter halted, watching the train file past, carrying Derrick's\nploughs away from his ranch, at this very time of the first rain,\nwhen they would be most needed. He watched it, silent, thoughtful, and\nwithout articulate comment. Even after it passed he sat in his place a\nlong time, watching it lose itself slowly in the distance, its prolonged\nrumble diminishing to a faint murmur. Soon he heard the engine sounding\nits whistle for the Long Trestle.\n\nBut the moving train no longer carried with it that impression of terror\nand destruction that had so thrilled Presley's imagination the night\nbefore. It passed slowly on its way with a mournful roll of wheels, like\nthe passing of a cortege, like a file of artillery-caissons charioting\ndead bodies; the engine's smoke enveloping it in a mournful veil,\nleaving a sense of melancholy in its wake, moving past there,\nlugubrious, lamentable, infinitely sad under the grey sky and under\nthe grey mist of rain which continued to fall with a subdued, rustling\nsound, steady, persistent, a vast monotonous murmur that seemed to come\nfrom all quarters of the horizon at once.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nWhen Annixter arrived at the Los Muertos ranch house that same evening,\nhe found a little group already assembled in the dining-room. Magnus\nDerrick, wearing the frock coat of broadcloth that he had put on for\nthe occasion, stood with his back to the fireplace. Harran sat close at\nhand, one leg thrown over the arm of his chair. Presley lounged on the\nsofa, in corduroys and high laced boots, smoking cigarettes. Broderson\nleaned on his folded arms at one corner of the dining table, and\nGenslinger, editor and proprietor of the principal newspaper of the\ncounty, the “Bonneville Mercury,” stood with his hat and driving gloves\nunder his arm, opposite Derrick, a half-emptied glass of whiskey and\nwater in his hand.\n\nAs Annixter entered he heard Genslinger observe: “I'll have a leader in\nthe 'Mercury' to-morrow that will interest you people. There's some talk\nof your ranch lands being graded in value this winter. I suppose you\nwill all buy?”\n\nIn an instant the editor's words had riveted upon him the attention of\nevery man in the room. Annixter broke the moment's silence that followed\nwith the remark:\n\n“Well, it's about time they graded these lands of theirs.”\n\nThe question in issue in Genslinger's remark was of the most vital\ninterest to the ranchers around Bonneville and Guadalajara. Neither\nMagnus Derrick, Broderson, Annixter, nor Osterman actually owned all\nthe ranches which they worked. As yet, the vast majority of these wheat\nlands were the property of the P. and S. W. The explanation of this\ncondition of affairs went back to the early history of the Pacific and\nSouthwestern, when, as a bonus for the construction of the road, the\nnational government had granted to the company the odd numbered sections\nof land on either side of the proposed line of route for a distance of\ntwenty miles. Indisputably, these sections belonged to the P. and S. W.\nThe even-numbered sections being government property could be and had\nbeen taken up by the ranchers, but the railroad sections, or, as they\nwere called, the “alternate sections,” would have to be purchased direct\nfrom the railroad itself.\n\nBut this had not prevented the farmers from “coming in” upon that part\nof the San Joaquin. Long before this the railroad had thrown open these\nlands, and, by means of circulars, distributed broadcast throughout the\nState, had expressly invited settlement thereon. At that time patents\nhad not been issued to the railroad for their odd-numbered sections, but\nas soon as the land was patented the railroad would grade it in value\nand offer it for sale, the first occupants having the first chance of\npurchase. The price of these lands was to be fixed by the price the\ngovernment put upon its own adjoining lands--about two dollars and a\nhalf per acre.\n\nWith cultivation and improvement the ranches must inevitably appreciate\nin value. There was every chance to make fortunes. When the railroad\nlands about Bonneville had been thrown open, there had been almost a\nrush in the matter of settlement, and Broderson, Annixter, Derrick, and\nOsterman, being foremost with their claims, had secured the pick of the\ncountry. But the land once settled upon, the P. and S. W. seemed to be\nin no hurry as to fixing exactly the value of its sections included in\nthe various ranches and offering them for sale. The matter dragged along\nfrom year to year, was forgotten for months together, being only brought\nto mind on such occasions as this, when the rumour spread that the\nGeneral Office was about to take definite action in the affair.\n\n“As soon as the railroad wants to talk business with me,” observed\nAnnixter, “about selling me their interest in Quien Sabe, I'm ready.\nThe land has more than quadrupled in value. I'll bet I could sell it\nto-morrow for fifteen dollars an acre, and if I buy of the railroad for\ntwo and a half an acre, there's boodle in the game.”\n\n“For two and a half!” exclaimed Genslinger. “You don't suppose the\nrailroad will let their land go for any such figure as that, do you?\nWherever did you get that idea?”\n\n“From the circulars and pamphlets,” answered Harran, “that the railroad\nissued to us when they opened these lands. They are pledged to that.\nEven the P. and S. W. couldn't break such a pledge as that. You are new\nin the country, Mr. Genslinger. You don't remember the conditions upon\nwhich we took up this land.”\n\n“And our improvements,” exclaimed Annixter. “Why, Magnus and I have\nput about five thousand dollars between us into that irrigating ditch\nalready. I guess we are not improving the land just to make it valuable\nfor the railroad people. No matter how much we improve the land, or how\nmuch it increases in value, they have got to stick by their agreement on\nthe basis of two-fifty per acre. Here's one case where the P. and S. W.\nDON'T get everything in sight.”\n\nGenslinger frowned, perplexed.\n\n“I AM new in the country, as Harran says,” he answered, “but it seems\nto me that there's no fairness in that proposition. The presence of the\nrailroad has helped increase the value of your ranches quite as much\nas your improvements. Why should you get all the benefit of the rise\nin value and the railroad nothing? The fair way would be to share it\nbetween you.”\n\n“I don't care anything about that,” declared Annixter. “They agreed to\ncharge but two-fifty, and they've got to stick to it.”\n\n“Well,” murmured Genslinger, “from what I know of the affair, I don't\nbelieve the P. and S. W. intends to sell for two-fifty an acre, at all.\nThe managers of the road want the best price they can get for everything\nin these hard times.”\n\n“Times aren't ever very hard for the railroad,” hazards old Broderson.\n\nBroderson was the oldest man in the room. He was about sixty-five years\nof age, venerable, with a white beard, his figure bent earthwards with\nhard work.\n\nHe was a narrow-minded man, painfully conscientious in his statements\nlest he should be unjust to somebody; a slow thinker, unable to let a\nsubject drop when once he had started upon it. He had no sooner uttered\nhis remark about hard times than he was moved to qualify it.\n\n“Hard times,” he repeated, a troubled, perplexed note in his voice;\n“well, yes--yes. I suppose the road DOES have hard times, maybe.\nEverybody does--of course. I didn't mean that exactly. I believe in\nbeing just and fair to everybody. I mean that we've got to use their\nlines and pay their charges good years AND bad years, the P. and S. W.\nbeing the only road in the State. That is--well, when I say the only\nroad--no, I won't say the ONLY road. Of course there are other roads.\nThere's the D. P. and M. and the San Francisco and North Pacific, that\nruns up to Ukiah. I got a brother-in-law in Ukiah. That's not much of a\nwheat country round Ukiah though they DO grow SOME wheat there, come to\nthink. But I guess it's too far north. Well, of course there isn't MUCH.\nPerhaps sixty thousand acres in the whole county--if you include barley\nand oats. I don't know; maybe it's nearer forty thousand. I don't\nremember very well. That's a good many years ago. I----”\n\nBut Annixter, at the end of all patience, turned to Genslinger, cutting\nshort the old man:\n\n“Oh, rot! Of course the railroad will sell at two-fifty,” he cried.\n“We've got the contracts.”\n\n“Look to them, then, Mr. Annixter,” retorted Genslinger significantly,\n“look to them. Be sure that you are protected.”\n\nSoon after this Genslinger took himself away, and Derrick's Chinaman\ncame in to set the table.\n\n“What do you suppose he meant?” asked Broderson, when Genslinger was\ngone.\n\n“About this land business?” said Annixter. “Oh, I don't know. Some tom\nfool idea. Haven't we got their terms printed in black and white in\ntheir circulars? There's their pledge.”\n\n“Oh, as to pledges,” murmured Broderson, “the railroad is not always TOO\nmuch hindered by those.”\n\n“Where's Osterman?” demanded Annixter, abruptly changing the subject as\nif it were not worth discussion. “Isn't that goat Osterman coming down\nhere to-night?”\n\n“You telephoned him, didn't you, Presley?” inquired Magnus.\n\nPresley had taken Princess Nathalie upon his knee stroking her long,\nsleek hair, and the cat, stupefied with beatitude, had closed her eyes\nto two fine lines, clawing softly at the corduroy of Presley's trousers\nwith alternate paws.\n\n“Yes, sir,” returned Presley. “He said he would be here.”\n\nAnd as he spoke, young Osterman arrived.\n\nHe was a young fellow, but singularly inclined to baldness. His ears,\nvery red and large, stuck out at right angles from either side of his\nhead, and his mouth, too, was large--a great horizontal slit beneath\nhis nose. His cheeks were of a brownish red, the cheek bones a little\nsalient. His face was that of a comic actor, a singer of songs, a man\nnever at a loss for an answer, continually striving to make a laugh.\nBut he took no great interest in ranching and left the management of\nhis land to his superintendents and foremen, he, himself, living in\nBonneville. He was a poser, a wearer of clothes, forever acting a part,\nstriving to create an impression, to draw attention to himself. He\nwas not without a certain energy, but he devoted it to small ends, to\nperfecting himself in little accomplishments, continually running after\nsome new thing, incapable of persisting long in any one course. At one\nmoment his mania would be fencing; the next, sleight-of-hand tricks;\nthe next, archery. For upwards of one month he had devoted himself to\nlearning how to play two banjos simultaneously, then abandoning this\nhad developed a sudden passion for stamped leather work and had made a\nquantity of purses, tennis belts, and hat bands, which he presented to\nyoung ladies of his acquaintance. It was his policy never to make an\nenemy. He was liked far better than he was respected. People spoke of\nhim as “that goat Osterman,” or “that fool Osterman kid,” and invited\nhim to dinner. He was of the sort who somehow cannot be ignored. If only\nbecause of his clamour he made himself important. If he had one abiding\ntrait, it was his desire of astonishing people, and in some way,\nbest known to himself, managed to cause the circulation of the most\nextraordinary stories wherein he, himself, was the chief actor. He\nwas glib, voluble, dexterous, ubiquitous, a teller of funny stories, a\ncracker of jokes.\n\nNaturally enough, he was heavily in debt, but carried the burden of it\nwith perfect nonchalance. The year before S. Behrman had held mortgages\nfor fully a third of his crop and had squeezed him viciously for\ninterest. But for all that, Osterman and S. Behrman were continually\nseen arm-in-arm on the main street of Bonneville. Osterman was\naccustomed to slap S. Behrman on his fat back, declaring:\n\n“You're a good fellow, old jelly-belly, after all, hey?”\n\nAs Osterman entered from the porch, after hanging his cavalry poncho and\ndripping hat on the rack outside, Mrs. Derrick appeared in the door that\nopened from the dining-room into the glass-roofed hallway just beyond.\nOsterman saluted her with effusive cordiality and with ingratiating\nblandness.\n\n“I am not going to stay,” she explained, smiling pleasantly at the group\nof men, her pretty, wide-open brown eyes, with their look of inquiry and\ninnocence, glancing from face to face, “I only came to see if you wanted\nanything and to say how do you do.”\n\nShe began talking to old Broderson, making inquiries as to his wife, who\nhad been sick the last week, and Osterman turned to the company, shaking\nhands all around, keeping up an incessant stream of conversation.\n\n“Hello, boys and girls. Hello, Governor. Sort of a gathering of the\nclans to-night. Well, if here isn't that man Annixter. Hello, Buck. What\ndo you know? Kind of dusty out to-night.”\n\nAt once Annixter began to get red in the face, retiring towards a corner\nof the room, standing in an awkward position by the case of stuffed\nbirds, shambling and confused, while Mrs. Derrick was present, standing\nrigidly on both feet, his elbows close to his sides. But he was angry\nwith Osterman, muttering imprecations to himself, horribly vexed that\nthe young fellow should call him “Buck” before Magnus's wife. This goat\nOsterman! Hadn't he any sense, that fool? Couldn't he ever learn how to\nbehave before a feemale? Calling him “Buck” like that while Mrs. Derrick\nwas there. Why a stable-boy would know better; a hired man would have\nbetter manners. All through the dinner that followed Annixter was out of\nsorts, sulking in his place, refusing to eat by way of vindicating his\nself-respect, resolving to bring Osterman up with a sharp turn if he\ncalled him “Buck” again.\n\nThe Chinaman had made a certain kind of plum pudding for dessert, and\nAnnixter, who remembered other dinners at the Derrick's, had been saving\nhimself for this, and had meditated upon it all through the meal. No\ndoubt, it would restore all his good humour, and he believed his stomach\nwas so far recovered as to be able to stand it.\n\nBut, unfortunately, the pudding was served with a sauce that he\nabhorred--a thick, gruel-like, colourless mixture, made from plain water\nand sugar. Before he could interfere, the Chinaman had poured a quantity\nof it upon his plate.\n\n“Faugh!” exclaimed Annixter. “It makes me sick. Such--such SLOOP. Take\nit away. I'll have mine straight, if you don't mind.”\n\n“That's good for your stomach, Buck,” observed young Osterman; “makes it\ngo down kind of sort of slick; don't you see? Sloop, hey? That's a good\nname.”\n\n“Look here, don't you call me Buck. You don't seem to have any sense,\nand, besides, it ISN'T good for my stomach. I know better. What do YOU\nknow about my stomach, anyhow? Just looking at sloop like that makes me\nsick.”\n\nA little while after this the Chinaman cleared away the dessert and\nbrought in coffee and cigars. The whiskey bottle and the syphon of\nsoda-water reappeared. The men eased themselves in their places, pushing\nback from the table, lighting their cigars, talking of the beginning\nof the rains and the prospects of a rise in wheat. Broderson began an\nelaborate mental calculation, trying to settle in his mind the exact\ndate of his visit to Ukiah, and Osterman did sleight-of-hand tricks with\nbread pills. But Princess Nathalie, the cat, was uneasy. Annixter was\noccupying her own particular chair in which she slept every night. She\ncould not go to sleep, but spied upon him continually, watching his\nevery movement with her lambent, yellow eyes, clear as amber.\n\nThen, at length, Magnus, who was at the head of the table, moved in his\nplace, assuming a certain magisterial attitude. “Well, gentlemen,” he\nobserved, “I have lost my case against the railroad, the grain-rate\ncase. Ulsteen decided against me, and now I hear rumours to the effect\nthat rates for the hauling of grain are to be advanced.”\n\nWhen Magnus had finished, there was a moment's silence, each member of\nthe group maintaining his attitude of attention and interest. It was\nHarran who first spoke.\n\n“S. Behrman manipulated the whole affair. There's a big deal of some\nkind in the air, and if there is, we all know who is back of it; S.\nBehrman, of course, but who's back of him? It's Shelgrim.”\n\nShelgrim! The name fell squarely in the midst of the conversation,\nabrupt, grave, sombre, big with suggestion, pregnant with huge\nassociations. No one in the group who was not familiar with it; no one,\nfor that matter, in the county, the State, the whole reach of the West,\nthe entire Union, that did not entertain convictions as to the man who\ncarried it; a giant figure in the end-of-the-century finance, a product\nof circumstance, an inevitable result of conditions, characteristic,\ntypical, symbolic of ungovernable forces. In the New Movement, the New\nFinance, the reorganisation of capital, the amalgamation of powers,\nthe consolidation of enormous enterprises--no one individual was more\nconstantly in the eye of the world; no one was more hated, more dreaded,\nno one more compelling of unwilling tribute to his commanding genius, to\nthe colossal intellect operating the width of an entire continent than\nthe president and owner of the Pacific and Southwestern.\n\n“I don't think, however, he has moved yet,” said Magnus.\n\n“The thing for us, then,” exclaimed Osterman, “is to stand from under\nbefore he does.”\n\n“Moved yet!” snorted Annixter. “He's probably moved so long ago that\nwe've never noticed it.”\n\n“In any case,” hazarded Magnus, “it is scarcely probable that the\ndeal--whatever it is to be--has been consummated. If we act quickly,\nthere may be a chance.”\n\n“Act quickly! How?” demanded Annixter. “Good Lord! what can you do?\nWe're cinched already. It all amounts to just this: YOU CAN'T BUCK\nAGAINST THE RAILROAD. We've tried it and tried it, and we are stuck\nevery time. You, yourself, Derrick, have just lost your grain-rate\ncase. S. Behrman did you up. Shelgrim owns the courts. He's got men like\nUlsteen in his pocket. He's got the Railroad Commission in his\npocket. He's got the Governor of the State in his pocket. He keeps\na million-dollar lobby at Sacramento every minute of the time the\nlegislature is in session; he's got his own men on the floor of the\nUnited States Senate. He has the whole thing organised like an army\ncorps. What ARE you going to do? He sits in his office in San Francisco\nand pulls the strings and we've got to dance.”\n\n“But--well--but,” hazarded Broderson, “but there's the Interstate\nCommerce Commission. At least on long-haul rates they----”\n\n“Hoh, yes, the Interstate Commerce Commission,” shouted Annixter,\nscornfully, “that's great, ain't it? The greatest Punch and Judy; show\non earth. It's almost as good as the Railroad Commission. There never\nwas and there never will be a California Railroad Commission not in the\npay of the P. and S. W.”\n\n“It is to the Railroad Commission, nevertheless,” remarked Magnus, “that\nthe people of the State must look for relief. That is our only hope.\nOnce elect Commissioners who would be loyal to the people, and the whole\nsystem of excessive rates falls to the ground.”\n\n“Well, why not HAVE a Railroad Commission of our own, then?” suddenly\ndeclared young Osterman.\n\n“Because it can't be done,” retorted Annixter. “YOU CAN'T BUCK AGAINST\nTHE RAILROAD and if you could you can't organise the farmers in the San\nJoaquin. We tried it once, and it was enough to turn your stomach. The\nrailroad quietly bought delegates through S. Behrman and did us up.”\n\n“Well, that's the game to play,” said Osterman decisively, “buy\ndelegates.”\n\n“It's the only game that seems to win,” admitted Harran gloomily. “Or\never will win,” exclaimed Osterman, a sudden excitement seeming to take\npossession of him. His face--the face of a comic actor, with its great\nslit of mouth and stiff, red ears--went abruptly pink.\n\n“Look here,” he cried, “this thing is getting desperate. We've fought\nand fought in the courts and out and we've tried agitation and--and all\nthe rest of it and S. Behrman sacks us every time. Now comes the time\nwhen there's a prospect of a big crop; we've had no rain for two years\nand the land has had a long rest. If there is any rain at all this\nwinter, we'll have a bonanza year, and just at this very moment when\nwe've got our chance--a chance to pay off our mortgages and get clear of\ndebt and make a strike--here is Shelgrim making a deal to cinch us and\nput up rates. And now here's the primaries coming off and a new Railroad\nCommission going in. That's why Shelgrim chose this time to make his\ndeal. If we wait till Shelgrim pulls it off, we're done for, that's\nflat. I tell you we're in a fix if we don't keep an eye open. Things are\ngetting desperate. Magnus has just said that the key to the whole thing\nis the Railroad Commission. Well, why not have a Commission of our own?\nNever mind how we get it, let's get it. If it's got to be bought, let's\nbuy it and put our own men on it and dictate what the rates will be.\nSuppose it costs a hundred thousand dollars. Well, we'll get back more\nthan that in cheap rates.”\n\n“Mr. Osterman,” said Magnus, fixing the young man with a swift glance,\n“Mr. Osterman, you are proposing a scheme of bribery, sir.”\n\n“I am proposing,” repeated Osterman, “a scheme of bribery. Exactly so.”\n\n“And a crazy, wild-eyed scheme at that,” said Annixter gruffly. “Even\nsupposing you bought a Railroad Commission and got your schedule of low\nrates, what happens? The P. and S. W. crowd get out an injunction and\ntie you up.”\n\n“They would tie themselves up, too. Hauling at low rates is better than\nno hauling at all. The wheat has got to be moved.” “Oh, rot!” cried\nAnnixter. “Aren't you ever going to learn any sense? Don't you know\nthat cheap transportation would benefit the Liverpool buyers and not us?\nCan't it be FED into you that you can't buck against the railroad? When\nyou try to buy a Board of Commissioners don't you see that you'll have\nto bid against the railroad, bid against a corporation that can chuck\nout millions to our thousands? Do you think you can bid against the P.\nand S. W.?”\n\n“The railroad don't need to know we are in the game against them till\nwe've got our men seated.”\n\n“And when you've got them seated, what's to prevent the corporation\nbuying them right over your head?”\n\n“If we've got the right kind of men in they could not be bought that\nway,” interposed Harran. “I don't know but what there's something in\nwhat Osterman says. We'd have the naming of the Commission and we'd name\nhonest men.”\n\nAnnixter struck the table with his fist in exasperation.\n\n“Honest men!” he shouted; “the kind of men you could get to go into such\na scheme would have to be DIS-honest to begin with.”\n\nBroderson, shifting uneasily in his place, fingering his beard with a\nvague, uncertain gesture, spoke again:\n\n“It would be the CHANCE of them--our Commissioners--selling out against\nthe certainty of Shelgrim doing us up. That is,” he hastened to add,\n“ALMOST a certainty; pretty near a certainty.”\n\n“Of course, it would be a chance,” exclaimed Osterman. “But it's come\nto the point where we've got to take chances, risk a big stake to make a\nbig strike, and risk is better than sure failure.”\n\n“I can be no party to a scheme of avowed bribery and corruption, Mr.\nOsterman,” declared Magnus, a ring of severity in his voice. “I am\nsurprised, sir, that you should even broach the subject in my hearing.”\n\n“And,” cried Annixter, “it can't be done.”\n\n“I don't know,” muttered Harran, “maybe it just wants a little spark\nlike this to fire the whole train.”\n\nMagnus glanced at his son in considerable surprise. He had not\nexpected this of Harran. But so great was his affection for his son, so\naccustomed had he become to listening to his advice, to respecting his\nopinions, that, for the moment, after the first shock of surprise and\ndisappointment, he was influenced to give a certain degree of attention\nto this new proposition. He in no way countenanced it. At any moment he\nwas prepared to rise in his place and denounce it and Osterman both. It\nwas trickery of the most contemptible order, a thing he believed to be\nunknown to the old school of politics and statesmanship to which he was\nproud to belong; but since Harran, even for one moment, considered it,\nhe, Magnus, who trusted Harran implicitly, would do likewise--if it was\nonly to oppose and defeat it in its very beginnings.\n\nAnd abruptly the discussion began. Gradually Osterman, by dint of his\nclamour, his strident reiteration, the plausibility of his glib, ready\nassertions, the ease with which he extricated himself when apparently\ndriven to a corner, completely won over old Broderson to his way of\nthinking. Osterman bewildered him with his volubility, the lightning\nrapidity with which he leaped from one subject to another, garrulous,\nwitty, flamboyant, terrifying the old man with pictures of the swift\napproach of ruin, the imminence of danger.\n\nAnnixter, who led the argument against him--loving argument though he\ndid--appeared to poor advantage, unable to present his side effectively.\nHe called Osterman a fool, a goat, a senseless, crazy-headed jackass,\nbut was unable to refute his assertions. His debate was the clumsy\nheaving of brickbats, brutal, direct. He contradicted everything\nOsterman said as a matter of principle, made conflicting assertions,\ndeclarations that were absolutely inconsistent, and when Osterman or\nHarran used these against him, could only exclaim:\n\n“Well, in a way it's so, and then again in a way it isn't.”\n\nBut suddenly Osterman discovered a new argument. “If we swing this\ndeal,” he cried, “we've got old jelly-belly Behrman right where we want\nhim.”\n\n“He's the man that does us every time,” cried Harran. “If there is dirty\nwork to be done in which the railroad doesn't wish to appear, it is\nS. Behrman who does it. If the freight rates are to be 'adjusted' to\nsqueeze us a little harder, it is S. Behrman who regulates what we can\nstand. If there's a judge to be bought, it is S. Behrman who does\nthe bargaining. If there is a jury to be bribed, it is S. Behrman\nwho handles the money. If there is an election to be jobbed, it is S.\nBehrman who manipulates it. It's Behrman here and Behrman there. It is\nBehrman we come against every time we make a move. It is Behrman who has\nthe grip of us and will never let go till he has squeezed us bone dry.\nWhy, when I think of it all sometimes I wonder I keep my hands off the\nman.”\n\nOsterman got on his feet; leaning across the table, gesturing wildly\nwith his right hand, his serio-comic face, with its bald forehead\nand stiff, red ears, was inflamed with excitement. He took the floor,\ncreating an impression, attracting all attention to himself, playing to\nthe gallery, gesticulating, clamourous, full of noise.\n\n“Well, now is your chance to get even,” he vociferated. “It is now or\nnever. You can take it and save the situation for yourselves and all\nCalifornia or you can leave it and rot on your own ranches. Buck, I know\nyou. I know you're not afraid of anything that wears skin. I know you've\ngot sand all through you, and I know if I showed you how we could put\nour deal through and seat a Commission of our own, you wouldn't hang\nback. Governor, you're a brave man. You know the advantage of prompt and\nfearless action. You are not the sort to shrink from taking chances. To\nplay for big stakes is just your game--to stake a fortune on the turn\nof a card. You didn't get the reputation of being the strongest poker\nplayer in El Dorado County for nothing. Now, here's the biggest gamble\nthat ever came your way. If we stand up to it like men with guts in us,\nwe'll win out. If we hesitate, we're lost.”\n\n“I don't suppose you can help playing the goat, Osterman,” remarked\nAnnixter, “but what's your idea? What do you think we can do? I'm not\nsaying,” he hastened to interpose, “that you've anyways convinced me by\nall this cackling. I know as well as you that we are in a hole. But I\nknew that before I came here to-night. YOU'VE not done anything to make\nme change my mind. But just what do you propose? Let's hear it.”\n\n“Well, I say the first thing to do is to see Disbrow. He's the political\nboss of the Denver, Pueblo, and Mojave road. We will have to get in with\nthe machine some way and that's particularly why I want Magnus with us.\nHe knows politics better than any of us and if we don't want to get sold\nagain we will have to have some one that's in the know to steer us.”\n\n“The only politics I understand, Mr. Osterman,” answered Magnus sternly,\n“are honest politics. You must look elsewhere for your political\nmanager. I refuse to have any part in this matter. If the Railroad\nCommission can be nominated legitimately, if your arrangements can be\nmade without bribery, I am with you to the last iota of my ability.”\n\n“Well, you can't get what you want without paying for it,” contradicted\nAnnixter.\n\nBroderson was about to speak when Osterman kicked his foot under the\ntable. He, himself, held his peace. He was quick to see that if he could\ninvolve Magnus and Annixter in an argument, Annixter, for the mere love\nof contention, would oppose the Governor and, without knowing it, would\ncommit himself to his--Osterman's--scheme.\n\nThis was precisely what happened. In a few moments Annixter was\ndeclaring at top voice his readiness to mortgage the crop of Quien Sabe,\nif necessary, for the sake of “busting S. Behrman.” He could see no\ngreat obstacle in the way of controlling the nominating convention so\nfar as securing the naming of two Railroad Commissioners was concerned.\nTwo was all they needed. Probably it WOULD cost money. You didn't get\nsomething for nothing. It would cost them all a good deal more if they\nsat like lumps on a log and played tiddledy-winks while Shelgrim sold\nout from under them. Then there was this, too: the P. and S. W. were\nhard up just then. The shortage on the State's wheat crop for the last\ntwo years had affected them, too. They were retrenching in expenditures\nall along the line. Hadn't they just cut wages in all departments? There\nwas this affair of Dyke's to prove it. The railroad didn't always act as\na unit, either. There was always a party in it that opposed spending too\nmuch money. He would bet that party was strong just now. He was kind of\nsick himself of being kicked by S. Behrman. Hadn't that pip turned up on\nhis ranch that very day to bully him about his own line fence? Next he\nwould be telling him what kind of clothes he ought to wear. Harran had\nthe right idea. Somebody had got to be busted mighty soon now and he\ndidn't propose that it should be he.\n\n“Now you are talking something like sense,” observed Osterman. “I\nthought you would see it like that when you got my idea.”\n\n“Your idea, YOUR idea!” cried Annixter. “Why, I've had this idea myself\nfor over three years.”\n\n“What about Disbrow?” asked Harran, hastening to interrupt. “Why do we\nwant to see Disbrow?”\n\n“Disbrow is the political man for the Denver, Pueblo, and Mojave,”\n answered Osterman, “and you see it's like this: the Mojave road don't\nrun up into the valley at all. Their terminus is way to the south of us,\nand they don't care anything about grain rates through the San Joaquin.\nThey don't care how anti-railroad the Commission is, because the\nCommission's rulings can't affect them. But they divide traffic with the\nP. and S. W. in the southern part of the State and they have a good\ndeal of influence with that road. I want to get the Mojave road, through\nDisbrow, to recommend a Commissioner of our choosing to the P. and S. W.\nand have the P. and S. W. adopt him as their own.”\n\n“Who, for instance?”\n\n“Darrell, that Los Angeles man--remember?”\n\n“Well, Darrell is no particular friend of Disbrow,” said Annixter. “Why\nshould Disbrow take him up?”\n\n“PREE-cisely,” cried Osterman. “We make it worth Disbrow's while to do\nit. We go to him and say, 'Mr. Disbrow, you manage the politics for the\nMojave railroad, and what you say goes with your Board of Directors. We\nwant you to adopt our candidate for Railroad Commissioner for the third\ndistrict. How much do you want for doing it?' I KNOW we can buy Disbrow.\nThat gives us one Commissioner. We need not bother about that any\nmore. In the first district we don't make any move at all. We let the\npolitical managers of the P. and S. W. nominate whoever they like.\nThen we concentrate all our efforts to putting in our man in the second\ndistrict. There is where the big fight will come.”\n\n“I see perfectly well what you mean, Mr. Osterman,” observed Magnus,\n“but make no mistake, sir, as to my attitude in this business. You may\ncount me as out of it entirely.”\n\n“Well, suppose we win,” put in Annixter truculently, already\nacknowledging himself as involved in the proposed undertaking; “suppose\nwe win and get low rates for hauling grain. How about you, then? You\ncount yourself IN then, don't you? You get all the benefit of lower\nrates without sharing any of the risks we take to secure them. No,\nnor any of the expense, either. No, you won't dirty your fingers with\nhelping us put this deal through, but you won't be so cursed particular\nwhen it comes to sharing the profits, will you?”\n\nMagnus rose abruptly to his full height, the nostrils of his thin,\nhawk-like nose vibrating, his smooth-shaven face paler than ever.\n\n“Stop right where you are, sir,” he exclaimed. “You forget yourself,\nMr. Annixter. Please understand that I tolerate such words as you have\npermitted yourself to make use of from no man, not even from my guest. I\nshall ask you to apologise.”\n\nIn an instant he dominated the entire group, imposing a respect that was\nas much fear as admiration. No one made response. For the moment he was\nthe Master again, the Leader. Like so many delinquent school-boys, the\nothers cowered before him, ashamed, put to confusion, unable to find\ntheir tongues. In that brief instant of silence following upon Magnus's\noutburst, and while he held them subdued and over-mastered, the fabric\nof their scheme of corruption and dishonesty trembled to its base. It\nwas the last protest of the Old School, rising up there in denunciation\nof the new order of things, the statesman opposed to the politician;\nhonesty, rectitude, uncompromising integrity, prevailing for the last\ntime against the devious manoeuvring, the evil communications, the\nrotten expediency of a corrupted institution.\n\nFor a few seconds no one answered. Then, Annixter, moving abruptly and\nuneasily in his place, muttered:\n\n“I spoke upon provocation. If you like, we'll consider it unsaid. I\ndon't know what's going to become of us--go out of business, I presume.”\n\n“I understand Magnus all right,” put in Osterman. “He don't have to\ngo into this thing, if it's against his conscience. That's all right.\nMagnus can stay out if he wants to, but that won't prevent us going\nahead and seeing what we can do. Only there's this about it.” He turned\nagain to Magnus, speaking with every degree of earnestness, every\nappearance of conviction. “I did not deny, Governor, from the very start\nthat this would mean bribery. But you don't suppose that I like the idea\neither. If there was one legitimate hope that was yet left untried,\nno matter how forlorn it was, I would try it. But there's not. It\nis literally and soberly true that every means of help--every honest\nmeans--has been attempted. Shelgrim is going to cinch us. Grain rates\nare increasing, while, on the other hand, the price of wheat is sagging\nlower and lower all the time. If we don't do something we are ruined.”\n\nOsterman paused for a moment, allowing precisely the right number of\nseconds to elapse, then altering and lowering his voice, added:\n\n“I respect the Governor's principles. I admire them. They do him every\ndegree of credit.” Then, turning directly to Magnus, he concluded with,\n“But I only want you to ask yourself, sir, if, at such a crisis, one\nought to think of oneself, to consider purely personal motives in such a\ndesperate situation as this? Now, we want you with us, Governor; perhaps\nnot openly, if you don't wish it, but tacitly, at least. I won't ask\nyou for an answer to-night, but what I do ask of you is to consider this\nmatter seriously and think over the whole business. Will you do it?”\n\nOsterman ceased definitely to speak, leaning forward across the table,\nhis eyes fixed on Magnus's face. There was a silence. Outside, the rain\nfell continually with an even, monotonous murmur. In the group of men\naround the table no one stirred nor spoke. They looked steadily at\nMagnus, who, for the moment, kept his glance fixed thoughtfully upon the\ntable before him. In another moment he raised his head and looked from\nface to face around the group. After all, these were his neighbours,\nhis friends, men with whom he had been upon the closest terms of\nassociation. In a way they represented what now had come to be his\nworld. His single swift glance took in the men, one after another.\nAnnixter, rugged, crude, sitting awkwardly and uncomfortably in his\nchair, his unhandsome face, with its outthrust lower lip and deeply\ncleft masculine chin, flushed and eager, his yellow hair disordered,\nthe one tuft on the crown standing stiffly forth like the feather in an\nIndian's scalp lock; Broderson, vaguely combing at his long beard with a\npersistent maniacal gesture, distressed, troubled and uneasy; Osterman,\nwith his comedy face, the face of a music-hall singer, his head bald\nand set off by his great red ears, leaning back in his place, softly\ncracking the knuckle of a forefinger, and, last of all and close to his\nelbow, his son, his support, his confidant and companion, Harran, so\nlike himself, with his own erect, fine carriage, his thin, beak-like\nnose and his blond hair, with its tendency to curl in a forward\ndirection in front of the ears, young, strong, courageous, full of the\npromise of the future years. His blue eyes looked straight into his\nfather's with what Magnus could fancy a glance of appeal. Magnus could\nsee that expression in the faces of the others very plainly. They looked\nto him as their natural leader, their chief who was to bring them out\nfrom this abominable trouble which was closing in upon them, and in them\nall he saw many types. They--these men around his table on that night\nof the first rain of a coming season--seemed to stand in his imagination\nfor many others--all the farmers, ranchers, and wheat growers of the\ngreat San Joaquin. Their words were the words of a whole community;\ntheir distress, the distress of an entire State, harried beyond the\nbounds of endurance, driven to the wall, coerced, exploited, harassed to\nthe limits of exasperation. “I will think of it,” he said, then hastened\nto add, “but I can tell you beforehand that you may expect only a\nrefusal.”\n\nAfter Magnus had spoken, there was a prolonged silence. The conference\nseemed of itself to have come to an end for that evening. Presley\nlighted another cigarette from the butt of the one he had been smoking,\nand the cat, Princess Nathalie, disturbed by his movement and by a whiff\nof drifting smoke, jumped from his knee to the floor and picking her way\nacross the room to Annixter, rubbed gently against his legs, her tail\nin the air, her back delicately arched. No doubt she thought it time\nto settle herself for the night, and as Annixter gave no indication of\nvacating his chair, she chose this way of cajoling him into ceding his\nplace to her. But Annixter was irritated at the Princess's attentions,\nmisunderstanding their motive.\n\n“Get out!” he exclaimed, lifting his feet to the rung of the chair.\n“Lord love me, but I sure do hate a cat.”\n\n“By the way,” observed Osterman, “I passed Genslinger by the gate as I\ncame in to-night. Had he been here?”\n\n“Yes, he was here,” said Harran, “and--” but Annixter took the words out\nof his mouth.\n\n“He says there's some talk of the railroad selling us their sections\nthis winter.”\n\n“Oh, he did, did he?” exclaimed Osterman, interested at once. “Where did\nhe hear that?”\n\n“Where does a railroad paper get its news? From the General Office, I\nsuppose.”\n\n“I hope he didn't get it straight from headquarters that the land was to\nbe graded at twenty dollars an acre,” murmured Broderson.\n\n“What's that?” demanded Osterman. “Twenty dollars! Here, put me on,\nsomebody. What's all up? What did Genslinger say?”\n\n“Oh, you needn't get scared,” said Annixter. “Genslinger don't know,\nthat's all. He thinks there was no understanding that the price of the\nland should not be advanced when the P. and S. W. came to sell to us.”\n\n“Oh,” muttered Osterman relieved. Magnus, who had gone out into the\noffice on the other side of the glass-roofed hallway, returned with a\nlong, yellow envelope in his hand, stuffed with newspaper clippings and\nthin, closely printed pamphlets.\n\n“Here is the circular,” he remarked, drawing out one of the pamphlets.\n“The conditions of settlement to which the railroad obligated itself are\nvery explicit.”\n\nHe ran over the pages of the circular, then read aloud:\n\n“'The Company invites settlers to go upon its lands before patents are\nissued or the road is completed, and intends in such cases to sell to\nthem in preference to any other applicants and at a price based upon the\nvalue of the land without improvements,' and on the other page here,” he\nremarked, “they refer to this again. 'In ascertaining the value of the\nlands, any improvements that a settler or any other person may have on\nthe lands will not be taken into consideration, neither will the price\nbe increased in consequence thereof.... Settlers are thus insured that\nin addition to being accorded the first privilege of purchase, at the\ngraded price, they will also be protected in their improvements.'\nAnd here,” he commented, “in Section IX. it reads, 'The lands are not\nuniform in price, but are offered at various figures from $2.50 upward\nper acre. Usually land covered with tall timber is held at $5.00 per\nacre, and that with pine at $10.00. Most is for sale at $2.50 and\n$5.00.”\n\n“When you come to read that carefully,” hazarded old Broderson,\n“it--it's not so VERY REASSURING. 'MOST is for sale at two-fifty an\nacre,' it says. That don't mean 'ALL,' that only means SOME. I wish now\nthat I had secured a more iron-clad agreement from the P. and S. W. when\nI took up its sections on my ranch, and--and Genslinger is in a position\nto know the intentions of the railroad. At least, he--he--he is in TOUCH\nwith them. All newspaper men are. Those, I mean, who are subsidised by\nthe General Office. But, perhaps, Genslinger isn't subsidised, I don't\nknow. I--I am not sure. Maybe--perhaps”\n\n“Oh, you don't know and you do know, and maybe and perhaps, and you're\nnot so sure,” vociferated Annixter. “How about ignoring the value of our\nimprovements? Nothing hazy about THAT statement, I guess. It says in so\nmany words that any improvements we make will not be considered when the\nland is appraised and that's the same thing, isn't it? The unimproved\nland is worth two-fifty an acre; only timber land is worth more and\nthere's none too much timber about here.”\n\n“Well, one thing at a time,” said Harran. “The thing for us now is to\nget into this primary election and the convention and see if we can push\nour men for Railroad Commissioners.”\n\n“Right,” declared Annixter. He rose, stretching his arms above his head.\n“I've about talked all the wind out of me,” he said. “Think I'll be\nmoving along. It's pretty near midnight.”\n\nBut when Magnus's guests turned their attention to the matter of\nreturning to their different ranches, they abruptly realised that the\ndownpour had doubled and trebled in its volume since earlier in the\nevening. The fields and roads were veritable seas of viscid mud, the\nnight absolutely black-dark; assuredly not a night in which to venture\nout. Magnus insisted that the three ranchers should put up at Los\nMuertos. Osterman accepted at once, Annixter, after an interminable\ndiscussion, allowed himself to be persuaded, in the end accepting as\nthough granting a favour. Broderson protested that his wife, who was not\nwell, would expect him to return that night and would, no doubt, fret\nif he did not appear. Furthermore, he lived close by, at the junction\nof the County and Lower Road. He put a sack over his head and shoulders,\npersistently declining Magnus's offered umbrella and rubber coat, and\nhurried away, remarking that he had no foreman on his ranch and had to\nbe up and about at five the next morning to put his men to work.\n\n“Fool!” muttered Annixter when the old man had gone. “Imagine farming a\nranch the size of his without a foreman.”\n\nHarran showed Osterman and Annixter where they were to sleep, in\nadjoining rooms. Magnus soon afterward retired.\n\nOsterman found an excuse for going to bed, but Annixter and Harran\nremained in the latter's room, in a haze of blue tobacco smoke, talking,\ntalking. But at length, at the end of all argument, Annixter got up,\nremarking:\n\n“Well, I'm going to turn in. It's nearly two o'clock.”\n\nHe went to his room, closing the door, and Harran, opening his window to\nclear out the tobacco smoke, looked out for a moment across the country\ntoward the south.\n\nThe darkness was profound, impenetrable; the rain fell with an\nuninterrupted roar. Near at hand one could hear the sound of dripping\neaves and foliage and the eager, sucking sound of the drinking earth,\nand abruptly while Harran stood looking out, one hand upon the upraised\nsash, a great puff of the outside air invaded the room, odourous with\nthe reek of the soaking earth, redolent with fertility, pungent, heavy,\ntepid. He closed the window again and sat for a few moments on the edge\nof the bed, one shoe in his hand, thoughtful and absorbed, wondering if\nhis father would involve himself in this new scheme, wondering if, after\nall, he wanted him to.\n\nBut suddenly he was aware of a commotion, issuing from the direction\nof Annixter's room, and the voice of Annixter himself upraised in\nexpostulation and exasperation. The door of the room to which Annixter\nhad been assigned opened with a violent wrench and an angry voice\nexclaimed to anybody who would listen:\n\n“Oh, yes, funny, isn't it? In a way, it's funny, and then, again, in a\nway it isn't.”\n\nThe door banged to so that all the windows of the house rattled in their\nframes.\n\nHarran hurried out into the dining-room and there met Presley and his\nfather, who had been aroused as well by Annixter's clamour. Osterman was\nthere, too, his bald head gleaming like a bulb of ivory in the light of\nthe lamp that Magnus carried.\n\n“What's all up?” demanded Osterman. “Whatever in the world is the matter\nwith Buck?”\n\nConfused and terrible sounds came from behind the door of Annixter's\nroom. A prolonged monologue of grievance, broken by explosions of wrath\nand the vague noise of some one in a furious hurry. All at once and\nbefore Harran had a chance to knock on the door, Annixter flung it open.\nHis face was blazing with anger, his outthrust lip more prominent than\never, his wiry, yellow hair in disarray, the tuft on the crown sticking\nstraight into the air like the upraised hackles of an angry hound.\nEvidently he had been dressing himself with the most headlong rapidity;\nhe had not yet put on his coat and vest, but carried them over his arm,\nwhile with his disengaged hand he kept hitching his suspenders over his\nshoulders with a persistent and hypnotic gesture. Without a moment's\npause he gave vent to his indignation in a torrent of words.\n\n“Ah, yes, in my bed, sloop, aha! I know the man who put it there,” he\nwent on, glaring at Osterman, “and that man is a PIP. Sloop! Slimy,\ndisgusting stuff; you heard me say I didn't like it when the Chink\npassed it to me at dinner--and just for that reason you put it in my\nbed, and I stick my feet into it when I turn in. Funny, isn't it? Oh,\nyes, too funny for any use. I'd laugh a little louder if I was you.”\n\n“Well, Buck,” protested Harran, as he noticed the hat in Annixter's\nhand, “you're not going home just for----”\n\nAnnixter turned on him with a shout.\n\n“I'll get plumb out of here,” he trumpeted. “I won't stay here another\nminute.”\n\nHe swung into his waistcoat and coat, scrabbling at the buttons in the\nviolence of his emotions. “And I don't know but what it will make me\nsick again to go out in a night like this. NO, I won't stay. Some things\nare funny, and then, again, there are some things that are not. Ah, yes,\nsloop! Well, that's all right. I can be funny, too, when you come to\nthat. You don't get a cent of money out of me. You can do your dirty\nbribery in your own dirty way. I won't come into this scheme at all.\nI wash my hands of the whole business. It's rotten and it's wild-eyed;\nit's dirt from start to finish; and you'll all land in State's prison.\nYou can count me out.”\n\n“But, Buck, look here, you crazy fool,” cried Harran, “I don't know who\nput that stuff in your bed, but I'm not going; to let you go back to\nQuien Sabe in a rain like this.”\n\n“I know who put it in,” clamoured the other, shaking his fists, “and\ndon't call me Buck and I'll do as I please. I WILL go back home. I'll\nget plumb out of here. Sorry I came. Sorry I ever lent myself to such a\ndisgusting, dishonest, dirty bribery game as this all to-night. I won't\nput a dime into it, no, not a penny.”\n\nHe stormed to the door leading out upon the porch, deaf to all reason.\nHarran and Presley followed him, trying to dissuade him from going home\nat that time of night and in such a storm, but Annixter was not to be\nplacated. He stamped across to the barn where his horse and buggy had\nbeen stabled, splashing through the puddles under foot, going out of his\nway to drench himself, refusing even to allow Presley and Harran to help\nhim harness the horse.\n\n“What's the use of making a fool of yourself, Annixter?” remonstrated\nPresley, as Annixter backed the horse from the stall. “You act just like\na ten-year-old boy. If Osterman wants to play the goat, why should you\nhelp him out?”\n\n“He's a PIP,” vociferated Annixter. “You don't understand, Presley. It\nruns in my family to hate anything sticky. It's--it's--it's heredity.\nHow would you like to get into bed at two in the morning and jam your\nfeet down into a slimy mess like that? Oh, no. It's not so funny then.\nAnd you mark my words, Mr. Harran Derrick,” he continued, as he climbed\ninto the buggy, shaking the whip toward Harran, “this business we talked\nover to-night--I'm OUT of it. It's yellow. It's too CURSED dishonest.”\n\nHe cut the horse across the back with the whip and drove out into the\npelting rain. In a few seconds the sound of his buggy wheels was lost in\nthe muffled roar of the downpour.\n\nHarran and Presley closed the barn and returned to the house, sheltering\nthemselves under a tarpaulin carriage cover. Once inside, Harran went to\nremonstrate with Osterman, who was still up. Magnus had again retired.\nThe house had fallen quiet again.\n\nAs Presley crossed the dining-room on the way to his own apartment in\nthe second story of the house, he paused for a moment, looking about\nhim. In the dull light of the lowered lamps, the redwood panelling of\nthe room showed a dark crimson as though stained with blood. On the\nmassive slab of the dining table the half-emptied glasses and bottles\nstood about in the confusion in which they had been left, reflecting\nthemselves deep into the polished wood; the glass doors of the case of\nstuffed birds was a subdued shimmer; the many-coloured Navajo blanket\nover the couch seemed a mere patch of brown.\n\nAround the table the chairs in which the men had sat throughout the\nevening still ranged themselves in a semi-circle, vaguely suggestive of\nthe conference of the past few hours, with all its possibilities of good\nand evil, its significance of a future big with portent. The room was\nstill. Only on the cushions of the chair that Annixter had occupied, the\ncat, Princess Nathalie, at last comfortably settled in her accustomed\nplace, dozed complacently, her paws tucked under her breast, filling the\ndeserted room with the subdued murmur of her contented purr.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nOn the Quien Sabe ranch, in one of its western divisions, near the line\nfence that divided it from the Osterman holding, Vanamee was harnessing\nthe horses to the plough to which he had been assigned two days before,\na stable-boy from the division barn helping him.\n\nPromptly discharged from the employ of the sheep-raisers after the\nlamentable accident near the Long Trestle, Vanamee had presented himself\nto Harran, asking for employment. The season was beginning; on all\nthe ranches work was being resumed. The rain had put the ground into\nadmirable condition for ploughing, and Annixter, Broderson, and Osterman\nall had their gangs at work. Thus, Vanamee was vastly surprised to find\nLos Muertos idle, the horses still in the barns, the men gathering in\nthe shade of the bunk-house and eating-house, smoking, dozing, or going\naimlessly about, their arms dangling. The ploughs for which Magnus and\nHarran were waiting in a fury of impatience had not yet arrived, and\nsince the management of Los Muertos had counted upon having these in\nhand long before this time, no provision had been made for keeping the\nold stock in repair; many of these old ploughs were useless, broken, and\nout of order; some had been sold. It could not be said definitely\nwhen the new ploughs would arrive. Harran had decided to wait one week\nlonger, and then, in case of their non-appearance, to buy a consignment\nof the old style of plough from the dealers in Bonneville. He could\nafford to lose the money better than he could afford to lose the season.\n\nFailing of work on Los Muertos, Vanamee had gone to Quien Sabe.\nAnnixter, whom he had spoken to first, had sent him across the ranch\nto one of his division superintendents, and this latter, after\nassuring himself of Vanamee's familiarity with horses and his previous\nexperience--even though somewhat remote--on Los Muertos, had taken him\non as a driver of one of the gang ploughs, then at work on his division.\n\nThe evening before, when the foreman had blown his whistle at six\no'clock, the long line of ploughs had halted upon the instant, and the\ndrivers, unharnessing their teams, had taken them back to the division\nbarns--leaving the ploughs as they were in the furrows. But an hour\nafter daylight the next morning the work was resumed. After breakfast,\nVanamee, riding one horse and leading the others, had returned to\nthe line of ploughs together with the other drivers. Now he was busy\nharnessing the team. At the division blacksmith shop--temporarily put\nup--he had been obliged to wait while one of his lead horses was shod,\nand he had thus been delayed quite five minutes. Nearly all the other\nteams were harnessed, the drivers on their seats, waiting for the\nforeman's signal.\n\n“All ready here?” inquired the foreman, driving up to Vanamee's team in\nhis buggy.\n\n“All ready, sir,” answered Vanamee, buckling the last strap.\n\nHe climbed to his seat, shaking out the reins, and turning about, looked\nback along the line, then all around him at the landscape inundated with\nthe brilliant glow of the early morning.\n\nThe day was fine. Since the first rain of the season, there had been no\nother. Now the sky was without a cloud, pale blue, delicate, luminous,\nscintillating with morning. The great brown earth turned a huge flank to\nit, exhaling the moisture of the early dew. The atmosphere, washed clean\nof dust and mist, was translucent as crystal. Far off to the east, the\nhills on the other side of Broderson Creek stood out against the pallid\nsaffron of the horizon as flat and as sharply outlined as if pasted on\nthe sky. The campanile of the ancient Mission of San Juan seemed as fine\nas frost work. All about between the horizons, the carpet of the land\nunrolled itself to infinity. But now it was no longer parched with heat,\ncracked and warped by a merciless sun, powdered with dust. The rain had\ndone its work; not a clod that was not swollen with fertility, not a\nfissure that did not exhale the sense of fecundity. One could not take\na dozen steps upon the ranches without the brusque sensation that\nunderfoot the land was alive; roused at last from its sleep, palpitating\nwith the desire of reproduction. Deep down there in the recesses of\nthe soil, the great heart throbbed once more, thrilling with passion,\nvibrating with desire, offering itself to the caress of the plough,\ninsistent, eager, imperious. Dimly one felt the deep-seated trouble of\nthe earth, the uneasy agitation of its members, the hidden tumult of\nits womb, demanding to be made fruitful, to reproduce, to disengage the\neternal renascent germ of Life that stirred and struggled in its loins.\n\nThe ploughs, thirty-five in number, each drawn by its team of ten,\nstretched in an interminable line, nearly a quarter of a mile in length,\nbehind and ahead of Vanamee. They were arranged, as it were, en echelon,\nnot in file--not one directly behind the other, but each succeeding\nplough its own width farther in the field than the one in front of it.\nEach of these ploughs held five shears, so that when the entire company\nwas in motion, one hundred and seventy-five furrows were made at the\nsame instant. At a distance, the ploughs resembled a great column of\nfield artillery. Each driver was in his place, his glance alternating\nbetween his horses and the foreman nearest at hand. Other foremen, in\ntheir buggies or buckboards, were at intervals along the line, like\nbattery lieutenants. Annixter himself, on horseback, in boots and\ncampaign hat, a cigar in his teeth, overlooked the scene.\n\nThe division superintendent, on the opposite side of the line, galloped\npast to a position at the head. For a long moment there was a silence. A\nsense of preparedness ran from end to end of the column. All things were\nready, each man in his place. The day's work was about to begin.\n\nSuddenly, from a distance at the head of the line came the shrill\ntrilling of a whistle. At once the foreman nearest Vanamee repeated it,\nat the same time turning down the line, and waving one arm. The signal\nwas repeated, whistle answering whistle, till the sounds lost themselves\nin the distance. At once the line of ploughs lost its immobility, moving\nforward, getting slowly under way, the horses straining in the traces. A\nprolonged movement rippled from team to team, disengaging in its passage\na multitude of sounds---the click of buckles, the creak of straining\nleather, the subdued clash of machinery, the cracking of whips, the deep\nbreathing of nearly four hundred horses, the abrupt commands and cries\nof the drivers, and, last of all, the prolonged, soothing murmur of\nthe thick brown earth turning steadily from the multitude of advancing\nshears.\n\nThe ploughing thus commenced, continued. The sun rose higher. Steadily\nthe hundred iron hands kneaded and furrowed and stroked the brown, humid\nearth, the hundred iron teeth bit deep into the Titan's flesh. Perched\non his seat, the moist living reins slipping and tugging in his hands,\nVanamee, in the midst of this steady confusion of constantly varying\nsensation, sight interrupted by sound, sound mingling with sight, on\nthis swaying, vibrating seat, quivering with the prolonged thrill of the\nearth, lapsed to a sort of pleasing numbness, in a sense, hypnotised by\nthe weaving maze of things in which he found himself involved. To keep\nhis team at an even, regular gait, maintaining the precise interval,\nto run his furrows as closely as possible to those already made by the\nplough in front--this for the moment was the entire sum of his duties.\nBut while one part of his brain, alert and watchful, took cognisance of\nthese matters, all the greater part was lulled and stupefied with the\nlong monotony of the affair.\n\nThe ploughing, now in full swing, enveloped him in a vague, slow-moving\nwhirl of things. Underneath him was the jarring, jolting, trembling\nmachine; not a clod was turned, not an obstacle encountered, that he did\nnot receive the swift impression of it through all his body, the very\nfriction of the damp soil, sliding incessantly from the shiny surface of\nthe shears, seemed to reproduce itself in his finger-tips and along the\nback of his head. He heard the horse-hoofs by the myriads crushing down\neasily, deeply, into the loam, the prolonged clinking of trace-chains,\nthe working of the smooth brown flanks in the harness, the clatter of\nwooden hames, the champing of bits, the click of iron shoes against\npebbles, the brittle stubble of the surface ground crackling and\nsnapping as the furrows turned, the sonorous, steady breaths wrenched\nfrom the deep, labouring chests, strap-bound, shining with sweat,\nand all along the line the voices of the men talking to the horses.\nEverywhere there were visions of glossy brown backs, straining, heaving,\nswollen with muscle; harness streaked with specks of froth, broad,\ncup-shaped hoofs, heavy with brown loam, men's faces red with tan, blue\noveralls spotted with axle-grease; muscled hands, the knuckles whitened\nin their grip on the reins, and through it all the ammoniacal smell of\nthe horses, the bitter reek of perspiration of beasts and men, the\naroma of warm leather, the scent of dead stubble--and stronger and more\npenetrating than everything else, the heavy, enervating odour of the\nupturned, living earth.\n\nAt intervals, from the tops of one of the rare, low swells of the land,\nVanamee overlooked a wider horizon. On the other divisions of Quien Sabe\nthe same work was in progress. Occasionally he could see another column\nof ploughs in the adjoining division--sometimes so close at hand that\nthe subdued murmur of its movements reached his ear; sometimes so\ndistant that it resolved itself into a long, brown streak upon the\ngrey of the ground. Farther off to the west on the Osterman ranch other\ncolumns came and went, and, once, from the crest of the highest swell on\nhis division, Vanamee caught a distant glimpse of the Broderson ranch.\nThere, too, moving specks indicated that the ploughing was under way.\nAnd farther away still, far off there beyond the fine line of the\nhorizons, over the curve of the globe, the shoulder of the earth, he\nknew were other ranches, and beyond these others, and beyond these still\nothers, the immensities multiplying to infinity.\n\nEverywhere throughout the great San Joaquin, unseen and unheard, a\nthousand ploughs up-stirred the land, tens of thousands of shears\nclutched deep into the warm, moist soil.\n\nIt was the long stroking caress, vigorous, male, powerful, for which the\nEarth seemed panting. The heroic embrace of a multitude of iron hands,\ngripping deep into the brown, warm flesh of the land that quivered\nresponsive and passionate under this rude advance, so robust as to be\nalmost an assault, so violent as to be veritably brutal. There, under\nthe sun and under the speckless sheen of the sky, the wooing of\nthe Titan began, the vast primal passion, the two world-forces, the\nelemental Male and Female, locked in a colossal embrace, at grapples in\nthe throes of an infinite desire, at once terrible and divine, knowing\nno law, untamed, savage, natural, sublime.\n\nFrom time to time the gang in which Vanamee worked halted on the signal\nfrom foreman or overseer. The horses came to a standstill, the vague\nclamour of the work lapsed away. Then the minutes passed. The whole work\nhung suspended. All up and down the line one demanded what had happened.\nThe division superintendent galloped past, perplexed and anxious. For\nthe moment, one of the ploughs was out of order, a bolt had slipped,\na lever refused to work, or a machine had become immobilised in heavy\nground, or a horse had lamed himself. Once, even, toward noon, an entire\nplough was taken out of the line, so out of gear that a messenger had to\nbe sent to the division forge to summon the machinist.\n\nAnnixter had disappeared. He had ridden farther on to the other\ndivisions of his ranch, to watch the work in progress there. At twelve\no'clock, according to his orders, all the division superintendents put\nthemselves in communication with him by means of the telephone wires\nthat connected each of the division houses, reporting the condition\nof the work, the number of acres covered, the prospects of each plough\ntraversing its daily average of twenty miles.\n\nAt half-past twelve, Vanamee and the rest of the drivers ate their\nlunch in the field, the tin buckets having been distributed to them that\nmorning after breakfast. But in the evening, the routine of the previous\nday was repeated, and Vanamee, unharnessing his team, riding one horse\nand leading the others, returned to the division barns and bunk-house.\n\nIt was between six and seven o'clock. The half hundred men of the gang\nthrew themselves upon the supper the Chinese cooks had set out in the\nshed of the eating-house, long as a bowling alley, unpainted, crude, the\nseats benches, the table covered with oil cloth. Overhead a half-dozen\nkerosene lamps flared and smoked.\n\nThe table was taken as if by assault; the clatter of iron knives upon\nthe tin plates was as the reverberation of hail upon a metal roof. The\nploughmen rinsed their throats with great draughts of wine, and, their\nelbows wide, their foreheads flushed, resumed the attack upon the beef\nand bread, eating as though they would never have enough. All up and\ndown the long table, where the kerosene lamps reflected themselves deep\nin the oil-cloth cover, one heard the incessant sounds of mastication,\nand saw the uninterrupted movement of great jaws. At every moment one\nor another of the men demanded a fresh portion of beef, another pint of\nwine, another half-loaf of bread. For upwards of an hour the gang ate.\nIt was no longer a supper. It was a veritable barbecue, a crude and\nprimitive feasting, barbaric, homeric.\n\nBut in all this scene Vanamee saw nothing repulsive. Presley would\nhave abhorred it--this feeding of the People, this gorging of the human\nanimal, eager for its meat. Vanamee, simple, uncomplicated, living so\nclose to nature and the rudimentary life, understood its significance.\nHe knew very well that within a short half-hour after this meal the\nmen would throw themselves down in their bunks to sleep without moving,\ninert and stupefied with fatigue, till the morning. Work, food, and\nsleep, all life reduced to its bare essentials, uncomplex, honest,\nhealthy. They were strong, these men, with the strength of the soil they\nworked, in touch with the essential things, back again to the starting\npoint of civilisation, coarse, vital, real, and sane.\n\nFor a brief moment immediately after the meal, pipes were lit, and\nthe air grew thick with fragrant tobacco smoke. On a corner of the\ndining-room table, a game of poker was begun. One of the drivers, a\nSwede, produced an accordion; a group on the steps of the bunk-house\nlistened, with alternate gravity and shouts of laughter, to the\nacknowledged story-teller of the gang. But soon the men began to turn\nin, stretching themselves at full length on the horse blankets in the\nracklike bunks. The sounds of heavy breathing increased steadily, lights\nwere put out, and before the afterglow had faded from the sky, the gang\nwas asleep.\n\nVanamee, however, remained awake. The night was fine, warm; the sky\nsilver-grey with starlight. By and by there would be a moon. In the\nfirst watch after the twilight, a faint puff of breeze came up out\nof the south. From all around, the heavy penetrating smell of the\nnew-turned earth exhaled steadily into the darkness. After a while, when\nthe moon came up, he could see the vast brown breast of the earth turn\ntoward it. Far off, distant objects came into view: The giant oak tree\nat Hooven's ranch house near the irrigating ditch on Los Muertos, the\nskeleton-like tower of the windmill on Annixter's Home ranch, the clump\nof willows along Broderson Creek close to the Long Trestle, and, last of\nall, the venerable tower of the Mission of San Juan on the high ground\nbeyond the creek.\n\nThitherward, like homing pigeons, Vanamee's thoughts turned\nirresistibly. Near to that tower, just beyond, in the little hollow,\nhidden now from his sight, was the Seed ranch where Angele Varian\nhad lived. Straining his eyes, peering across the intervening levels,\nVanamee fancied he could almost see the line of venerable pear trees\nin whose shadow she had been accustomed to wait for him. On many such\na night as this he had crossed the ranches to find her there. His mind\nwent back to that wonderful time of his life sixteen years before\nthis, when Angele was alive, when they two were involved in the sweet\nintricacies of a love so fine, so pure, so marvellous that it seemed to\nthem a miracle, a manifestation, a thing veritably divine, put into the\nlife of them and the hearts of them by God Himself. To that they had\nbeen born. For this love's sake they had come into the world, and\nthe mingling of their lives was to be the Perfect Life, the intended,\nordained union of the soul of man with the soul of woman, indissoluble,\nharmonious as music, beautiful beyond all thought, a foretaste of\nHeaven, a hostage of immortality.\n\nNo, he, Vanamee, could never, never forget, never was the edge of his\ngrief to lose its sharpness, never would the lapse of time blunt the\ntooth of his pain. Once more, as he sat there, looking off across the\nranches, his eyes fixed on the ancient campanile of the Mission church,\nthe anguish that would not die leaped at his throat, tearing at his\nheart, shaking him and rending him with a violence as fierce and as\nprofound as if it all had been but yesterday. The ache returned to his\nheart a physical keen pain; his hands gripped tight together, twisting,\ninterlocked, his eyes filled with tears, his whole body shaken and riven\nfrom head to heel.\n\nHe had lost her. God had not meant it, after all. The whole matter had\nbeen a mistake. That vast, wonderful love that had come upon them had\nbeen only the flimsiest mockery. Abruptly Vanamee rose. He knew the\nnight that was before him. At intervals throughout the course of his\nprolonged wanderings, in the desert, on the mesa, deep in the canon,\nlost and forgotten on the flanks of unnamed mountains, alone under the\nstars and under the moon's white eye, these hours came to him, his grief\nrecoiling upon him like the recoil of a vast and terrible engine.\nThen he must fight out the night, wrestling with his sorrow, praying\nsometimes, incoherent, hardly conscious, asking “Why” of the night and\nof the stars.\n\nSuch another night had come to him now. Until dawn he knew he must\nstruggle with his grief, torn with memories, his imagination assaulted\nwith visions of a vanished happiness. If this paroxysm of sorrow was to\nassail him again that night, there was but one place for him to be. He\nwould go to the Mission--he would see Father Sarria; he would pass the\nnight in the deep shadow of the aged pear trees in the Mission garden.\n\nHe struck out across Quien Sabe, his face, the face of an ascetic, lean,\nbrown, infinitely sad, set toward the Mission church. In about an hour\nhe reached and crossed the road that led northward from Guadalajara\ntoward the Seed ranch, and, a little farther on, forded Broderson Creek\nwhere it ran through one corner of the Mission land. He climbed the\nhill and halted, out of breath from his brisk wall, at the end of the\ncolonnade of the Mission itself.\n\nUntil this moment Vanamee had not trusted himself to see the Mission at\nnight. On the occasion of his first daytime visit with Presley, he had\nhurried away even before the twilight had set in, not daring for the\nmoment to face the crowding phantoms that in his imagination filled the\nMission garden after dark. In the daylight, the place had seemed\nstrange to him. None of his associations with the old building and its\nsurroundings were those of sunlight and brightness. Whenever, during his\nlong sojourns in the wilderness of the Southwest, he had called up the\npicture in the eye of his mind, it had always appeared to him in the dim\nmystery of moonless nights, the venerable pear trees black with shadow,\nthe fountain a thing to be heard rather than seen.\n\nBut as yet he had not entered the garden. That lay on the other side of\nthe Mission. Vanamee passed down the colonnade, with its uneven pavement\nof worn red bricks, to the last door by the belfry tower, and rang the\nlittle bell by pulling the leather thong that hung from a hole in the\ndoor above the knob.\n\nBut the maid-servant, who, after a long interval opened the door,\nblinking and confused at being roused from her sleep, told Vanamee that\nSarria was not in his room. Vanamee, however, was known to her as the\npriest's protege and great friend, and she allowed him to enter, telling\nhim that, no doubt, he would find Sarria in the church itself. The\nservant led the way down the cool adobe passage to a larger room that\noccupied the entire width of the bottom of the belfry tower, and whence\na flight of aged steps led upward into the dark. At the foot of the\nstairs was a door opening into the church. The servant admitted Vanamee,\nclosing the door behind her.\n\nThe interior of the Mission, a great oblong of white-washed adobe with\na flat ceiling, was lighted dimly by the sanctuary lamp that hung from\nthree long chains just over the chancel rail at the far end of the\nchurch, and by two or three cheap kerosene lamps in brackets of\nimitation bronze. All around the walls was the inevitable series of\npictures representing the Stations of the Cross. They were of a\nhideous crudity of design and composition, yet were wrought out with an\ninnocent, unquestioning sincerity that was not without its charm. Each\npicture framed alike in gilt, bore its suitable inscription in staring\nblack letters. “Simon, The Cyrenean, Helps Jesus to Carry His Cross.”\n “Saint Veronica Wipes the Face of Jesus.” “Jesus Falls for the Fourth\nTime,” and so on. Half-way up the length of the church the pews began,\ncoffin-like boxes of blackened oak, shining from years of friction, each\nwith its door; while over them, and built out from the wall, was the\npulpit, with its tarnished gilt sounding-board above it, like the raised\ncover of a great hat-box. Between the pews, in the aisle, the violent\nvermilion of a strip of ingrain carpet assaulted the eye. Farther on\nwere the steps to the altar, the chancel rail of worm-riddled oak, the\nhigh altar, with its napery from the bargain counters of a San Francisco\nstore, the massive silver candlesticks, each as much as one man could\nlift, the gift of a dead Spanish queen, and, last, the pictures of the\nchancel, the Virgin in a glory, a Christ in agony on the cross, and\nSt. John the Baptist, the patron saint of the Mission, the San Juan\nBautista, of the early days, a gaunt grey figure, in skins, two fingers\nupraised in the gesture of benediction.\n\nThe air of the place was cool and damp, and heavy with the flat, sweet\nscent of stale incense smoke. It was of a vault-like stillness, and the\nclosing of the door behind Vanamee reechoed from corner to corner with a\nprolonged reverberation of thunder.\n\nHowever, Father Sarria was not in the church. Vanamee took a couple of\nturns the length of the aisle, looking about into the chapels on either\nside of the chancel. But the building was deserted. The priest had been\nthere recently, nevertheless, for the altar furniture was in disarray,\nas though he had been rearranging it but a moment before. On both sides\nof the church and half-way up their length, the walls were pierced by\nlow archways, in which were massive wooden doors, clamped with iron\nbolts. One of these doors, on the pulpit side of the church, stood ajar,\nand stepping to it and pushing it wide open, Vanamee looked diagonally\nacross a little patch of vegetables--beets, radishes, and lettuce--to\nthe rear of the building that had once contained the cloisters, and\nthrough an open window saw Father Sarria diligently polishing the silver\ncrucifix that usually stood on the high altar. Vanamee did not call\nto the priest. Putting a finger to either temple, he fixed his eyes\nsteadily upon him for a moment as he moved about at his work. In a few\nseconds he closed his eyes, but only part way. The pupils contracted;\nhis forehead lowered to an expression of poignant intensity. Soon\nafterward he saw the priest pause abruptly in the act of drawing the\ncover over the crucifix, looking about him from side to side. He turned\nagain to his work, and again came to a stop, perplexed, curious. With\nuncertain steps, and evidently wondering why he did so, he came to the\ndoor of the room and opened it, looking out into the night. Vanamee,\nhidden in the deep shadow of the archway, did not move, but his eyes\nclosed, and the intense expression deepened on his face. The priest\nhesitated, moved forward a step, turned back, paused again, then came\nstraight across the garden patch, brusquely colliding with Vanamee,\nstill motionless in the recess of the archway.\n\nSarria gave a great start, catching his breath.\n\n“Oh--oh, it's you. Was it you I heard calling? No, I could not have\nheard--I remember now. What a strange power! I am not sure that it is\nright to do this thing, Vanamee. I--I HAD to come. I do not know why.\nIt is a great force--a power--I don't like it. Vanamee, sometimes it\nfrightens me.”\n\nVanamee put his chin in the air.\n\n“If I had wanted to, sir, I could have made you come to me from back\nthere in the Quien Sabe ranch.”\n\nThe priest shook his head.\n\n“It troubles me,” he said, “to think that my own will can count for so\nlittle. Just now I could not resist. If a deep river had been between\nus, I must have crossed it. Suppose I had been asleep now?” “It would\nhave been all the easier,” answered Vanamee. “I understand as little of\nthese things as you. But I think if you had been asleep, your power of\nresistance would have been so much the more weakened.”\n\n“Perhaps I should not have waked. Perhaps I should have come to you in\nmy sleep.”\n\n“Perhaps.”\n\nSarria crossed himself. “It is occult,” he hazarded. “No; I do not like\nit. Dear fellow,” he put his hand on Vanamee's shoulder, “don't--call\nme that way again; promise. See,” he held out his hand, “I am all of a\ntremble. There, we won't speak of it further. Wait for me a moment. I\nhave only to put the cross in its place, and a fresh altar cloth, and\nthen I am done. To-morrow is the feast of The Holy Cross, and I am\npreparing against it. The night is fine. We will smoke a cigar in the\ncloister garden.”\n\nA few moments later the two passed out of the door on the other side of\nthe church, opposite the pulpit, Sarria adjusting a silk skull cap\non his tonsured head. He wore his cassock now, and was far more the\nchurchman in appearance than when Vanamee and Presley had seen him on a\nformer occasion.\n\nThey were now in the cloister garden. The place was charming. Everywhere\ngrew clumps of palms and magnolia trees. A grapevine, over a century\nold, occupied a trellis in one angle of the walls which surrounded the\ngarden on two sides. Along the third side was the church itself, while\nthe fourth was open, the wall having crumbled away, its site marked\nonly by a line of eight great pear trees, older even than the grapevine,\ngnarled, twisted, bearing no fruit. Directly opposite the pear trees,\nin the south wall of the garden, was a round, arched portal, whose gate\ngiving upon the esplanade in front of the Mission was always closed.\nSmall gravelled walks, well kept, bordered with mignonette, twisted\nabout among the flower beds, and underneath the magnolia trees. In the\ncentre was a little fountain in a stone basin green with moss, while\njust beyond, between the fountain and the pear trees, stood what was\nleft of a sun dial, the bronze gnomon, green with the beatings of\nthe weather, the figures on the half-circle of the dial worn away,\nillegible.\n\nBut on the other side of the fountain, and directly opposite the door\nof the Mission, ranged against the wall, were nine graves--three with\nheadstones, the rest with slabs. Two of Sarria's predecessors were\nburied here; three of the graves were those of Mission Indians. One was\nthought to contain a former alcalde of Guadalajara; two more held the\nbodies of De La Cuesta and his young wife (taking with her to the grave\nthe illusion of her husband's love), and the last one, the ninth, at\nthe end of the line, nearest the pear trees, was marked by a little\nheadstone, the smallest of any, on which, together with the proper\ndates--only sixteen years apart--was cut the name “Angele Varian.”\n\nBut the quiet, the repose, the isolation of the little cloister garden\nwas infinitely delicious. It was a tiny corner of the great valley that\nstretched in all directions around it--shut off, discreet, romantic, a\ngarden of dreams, of enchantments, of illusions. Outside there, far\noff, the great grim world went clashing through its grooves, but in\nhere never an echo of the grinding of its wheels entered to jar upon the\nsubdued modulation of the fountain's uninterrupted murmur.\n\nSarria and Vanamee found their way to a stone bench against the side\nwall of the Mission, near the door from which they had just issued,\nand sat down, Sarria lighting a cigar, Vanamee rolling and smoking\ncigarettes in Mexican fashion.\n\nAll about them widened the vast calm night. All the stars were out. The\nmoon was coming up. There was no wind, no sound. The insistent flowing\nof the fountain seemed only as the symbol of the passing of time, a\nthing that was understood rather than heard, inevitable, prolonged. At\nlong intervals, a faint breeze, hardly more than a breath, found its way\ninto the garden over the enclosing walls, and passed overhead, spreading\neverywhere the delicious, mingled perfume of magnolia blossoms, of\nmignonette, of moss, of grass, and all the calm green life silently\nteeming within the enclosure of the walls.\n\nFrom where he sat, Vanamee, turning his head, could look out underneath\nthe pear trees to the north. Close at hand, a little valley lay between\nthe high ground on which the Mission was built, and the line of low\nhills just beyond Broderson Creek on the Quien Sabe. In here was the\nSeed ranch, which Angele's people had cultivated, a unique and beautiful\nstretch of five hundred acres, planted thick with roses, violets,\nlilies, tulips, iris, carnations, tube-roses, poppies, heliotrope--all\nmanner and description of flowers, five hundred acres of them, solid,\nthick, exuberant; blooming and fading, and leaving their seed or slips\nto be marketed broadcast all over the United States. This had been the\nvocation of Angele's parents--raising flowers for their seeds. All over\nthe country the Seed ranch was known. Now it was arid, almost dry, but\nwhen in full flower, toward the middle of summer, the sight of these\nhalf-thousand acres royal with colour--vermilion, azure, flaming\nyellow--was a marvel. When an east wind blew, men on the streets of\nBonneville, nearly twelve miles away, could catch the scent of this\nvalley of flowers, this chaos of perfume.\n\nAnd into this life of flowers, this world of colour, this atmosphere\noppressive and clogged and cloyed and thickened with sweet odour, Angele\nhad been born. There she had lived her sixteen years. There she had\ndied. It was not surprising that Vanamee, with his intense, delicate\nsensitiveness to beauty, his almost abnormal capacity for great\nhappiness, had been drawn to her, had loved her so deeply.\n\nShe came to him from out of the flowers, the smell of the roses in her\nhair of gold, that hung in two straight plaits on either side of her\nface; the reflection of the violets in the profound dark blue of her\neyes, perplexing, heavy-lidded, almond-shaped, oriental; the aroma\nand the imperial red of the carnations in her lips, with their almost\nEgyptian fulness; the whiteness of the lilies, the perfume of the\nlilies, and the lilies' slender balancing grace in her neck. Her hands\ndisengaged the odour of the heliotropes. The folds of her dress gave off\nthe enervating scent of poppies. Her feet were redolent of hyacinths.\n\nFor a long time after sitting down upon the bench, neither the priest\nnor Vanamee spoke. But after a while Sarria took his cigar from his\nlips, saying:\n\n“How still it is! This is a beautiful old garden, peaceful, very quiet.\nSome day I shall be buried here. I like to remember that; and you, too,\nVanamee.”\n\n“Quien sabe?”\n\n“Yes, you, too. Where else? No, it is better here, yonder, by the side\nof the little girl.”\n\n“I am not able to look forward yet, sir. The things that are to be are\nsomehow nothing to me at all. For me they amount to nothing.”\n\n“They amount to everything, my boy.”\n\n“Yes, to one part of me, but not to the part of me that belonged to\nAngele--the best part. Oh, you don't know,” he exclaimed with a sudden\nmovement, “no one can understand. What is it to me when you tell me that\nsometime after I shall die too, somewhere, in a vague place you call\nHeaven, I shall see her again? Do you think that the idea of that ever\nmade any one's sorrow easier to bear? Ever took the edge from any one's\ngrief?”\n\n“But you believe that----”\n\n“Oh, believe, believe!” echoed the other. “What do I believe? I don't\nknow. I believe, or I don't believe. I can remember what she WAS, but\nI cannot hope what she will be. Hope, after all, is only memory seen\nreversed. When I try to see her in another life--whatever you call\nit--in Heaven--beyond the grave--this vague place of yours; when I try\nto see her there, she comes to my imagination only as what she was,\nmaterial, earthly, as I loved her. Imperfect, you say; but that is as\nI saw her, and as I saw her, I loved her; and as she WAS, material,\nearthly, imperfect, she loved me. It's that, that I want,” he exclaimed.\n“I don't want her changed. I don't want her spiritualised, exalted,\nglorified, celestial. I want HER. I think it is only this feeling that\nhas kept me from killing myself. I would rather be unhappy in the\nmemory of what she actually was, than be happy in the realisation of her\ntransformed, changed, made celestial. I am only human. Her soul! That\nwas beautiful, no doubt. But, again, it was something very vague,\nintangible, hardly more than a phrase. But the touch of her hand was\nreal, the sound of her voice was real, the clasp of her arms about my\nneck was real. Oh,” he cried, shaken with a sudden wrench of passion,\n“give those back to me. Tell your God to give those back to me--the\nsound of her voice, the touch of her hand, the clasp of her dear arms,\nREAL, REAL, and then you may talk to me of Heaven.”\n\nSarria shook his head. “But when you meet her again,” he observed, “in\nHeaven, you, too, will be changed. You will see her spiritualised, with\nspiritual eyes. As she is now, she does not appeal to you. I understand\nthat. It is because, as you say, you are only human, while she is\ndivine. But when you come to be like her, as she is now, you will know\nher as she really is, not as she seemed to be, because her voice was\nsweet, because her hair was pretty, because her hand was warm in yours.\nVanamee, your talk is that of a foolish child. You are like one of\nthe Corinthians to whom Paul wrote. Do you remember? Listen now. I can\nrecall the words, and such words, beautiful and terrible at the same\ntime, such a majesty. They march like soldiers with trumpets. 'But some\nman will say'--as you have said just now--'How are the dead raised up?\nAnd with what body do they come? Thou fool! That which thou sowest is\nnot quickened except it die, and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not\nthat body that shall be, but bare grain. It may chance of wheat, or of\nsome other grain. But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and\nto every seed his own body.... It is sown a natural body; it is raised\na spiritual body.' It is because you are a natural body that you cannot\nunderstand her, nor wish for her as a spiritual body, but when you are\nboth spiritual, then you shall know each other as you are--know as you\nnever knew before. Your grain of wheat is your symbol of immortality.\nYou bury it in the earth. It dies, and rises again a thousand times more\nbeautiful. Vanamee, your dear girl was only a grain of humanity that\nwe have buried here, and the end is not yet. But all this is so old, so\nold. The world learned it a thousand years ago, and yet each man that\nhas ever stood by the open grave of any one he loved must learn it all\nover again from the beginning.”\n\nVanamee was silent for a moment, looking off with unseeing eyes between\nthe trunks of the pear trees, over the little valley.\n\n“That may all be as you say,” he answered after a while. “I have not\nlearned it yet, in any case. Now, I only know that I love her--oh, as if\nit all were yesterday--and that I am suffering, suffering, always.”\n\nHe leaned forward, his head supported on his clenched fists, the\ninfinite sadness of his face deepening like a shadow, the tears brimming\nin his deep-set eyes. A question that he must ask, which involved\nthe thing that was scarcely to be thought of, occurred to him at this\nmoment. After hesitating for a long moment, he said:\n\n“I have been away a long time, and I have had no news of this place\nsince I left. Is there anything to tell, Father? Has any discovery been\nmade, any suspicion developed, as to--the Other?”\n\nThe priest shook his head.\n\n“Not a word, not a whisper. It is a mystery. It always will be.”\n\nVanamee clasped his head between his clenched fists, rocking himself to\nand fro.\n\n“Oh, the terror of it,” he murmured. “The horror of it. And she--think\nof it, Sarria, only sixteen, a little girl; so innocent, that she never\nknew what wrong meant, pure as a little child is pure, who believed that\nall things were good; mature only in her love. And to be struck down\nlike that, while your God looked down from Heaven and would not take her\npart.” All at once he seemed to lose control of himself. One of those\nfuries of impotent grief and wrath that assailed him from time to time,\nblind, insensate, incoherent, suddenly took possession of him. A\ntorrent of words issued from his lips, and he flung out an arm, the\nfist clenched, in a fierce, quick gesture, partly of despair, partly of\ndefiance, partly of supplication. “No, your God would not take her part.\nWhere was God's mercy in that? Where was Heaven's protection in that?\nWhere was the loving kindness you preach about? Why did God give her\nlife if it was to be stamped out? Why did God give her the power of love\nif it was to come to nothing? Sarria, listen to me. Why did God make\nher so divinely pure if He permitted that abomination? Ha!” he exclaimed\nbitterly, “your God! Why, an Apache buck would have been more merciful.\nYour God! There is no God. There is only the Devil. The Heaven you pray\nto is only a joke, a wretched trick, a delusion. It is only Hell that is\nreal.”\n\nSarria caught him by the arm.\n\n“You are a fool and a child,” he exclaimed, “and it is blasphemy that\nyou are saying. I forbid it. You understand? I forbid it.”\n\nVanamee turned on him with a sudden cry. “Then, tell your God to give\nher back to me!”\n\nSarria started away from him, his eyes widening in astonishment,\nsurprised out of all composure by the other's outburst. Vanamee's\nswarthy face was pale, the sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes were marked\nwith great black shadows. The priest no longer recognised him. The\nface, that face of the ascetic, lean, framed in its long black hair and\npointed beard, was quivering with the excitement of hallucination. It\nwas the face of the inspired shepherds of the Hebraic legends, living\nclose to nature, the younger prophets of Israel, dwellers in the\nwilderness, solitary, imaginative, believing in the Vision, having\nstrange delusions, gifted with strange powers. In a brief second of\nthought, Sarria understood. Out into the wilderness, the vast arid\ndesert of the Southwest, Vanamee had carried his grief. For days, for\nweeks, months even, he had been alone, a solitary speck lost in the\nimmensity of the horizons; continually he was brooding, haunted with his\nsorrow, thinking, thinking, often hard put to it for food. The body was\nill-nourished, and the mind, concentrated forever upon one subject, had\nrecoiled upon itself, had preyed upon the naturally nervous temperament,\ntill the imagination had become exalted, morbidly active, diseased,\nbeset with hallucinations, forever in search of the manifestation, of\nthe miracle. It was small wonder that, bringing a fancy so distorted\nback to the scene of a vanished happiness, Vanamee should be racked with\nthe most violent illusions, beset in the throes of a veritable hysteria.\n\n“Tell your God to give her back to me,” he repeated with fierce\ninsistence.\n\nIt was the pitch of mysticism, the imagination harassed and goaded\nbeyond the normal round, suddenly flipping from the circumference,\nspinning off at a tangent, out into the void, where all things seemed\npossible, hurtling through the dark there, groping for the supernatural,\nclamouring for the miracle. And it was also the human, natural protest\nagainst the inevitable, the irrevocable; the spasm of revolt under the\nsting of death, the rebellion of the soul at the victory of the grave.\n\n“He can give her back to me if He only will,” Vanamee cried. “Sarria,\nyou must help me. I tell you--I warn you, sir, I can't last much longer\nunder it. My head is all wrong with it--I've no more hold on my mind.\nSomething must happen or I shall lose my senses. I am breaking down\nunder it all, my body and my mind alike. Bring her to me; make God show\nher to me. If all tales are true, it would not be the first time. If I\ncannot have her, at least let me see her as she was, real, earthly, not\nher spirit, her ghost. I want her real self, undefiled again. If this is\ndementia, then let me be demented. But help me, you and your God; create\nthe delusion, do the miracle.”\n\n“Stop!” cried the priest again, shaking him roughly by the shoulder.\n“Stop. Be yourself. This is dementia; but I shall NOT let you be\ndemented. Think of what you are saying. Bring her back to you! Is\nthat the way of God? I thought you were a man; this is the talk of a\nweak-minded girl.”\n\nVanamee stirred abruptly in his place, drawing a long breath and looking\nabout him vaguely, as if he came to himself.\n\n“You are right,” he muttered. “I hardly know what I am saying at times.\nBut there are moments when my whole mind and soul seem to rise up in\nrebellion against what has happened; when it seems to me that I am\nstronger than death, and that if I only knew how to use the strength\nof my will, concentrate my power of thought--volition--that I could--I\ndon't know--not call her back--but--something----”\n\n“A diseased and distorted mind is capable of hallucinations, if that is\nwhat you mean,” observed Sarria.\n\n“Perhaps that is what I mean. Perhaps I want only the delusion, after\nall.”\n\nSarria did not reply, and there was a long silence. In the damp south\ncorners of the walls a frog began to croak at exact intervals. The\nlittle fountain rippled monotonously, and a magnolia flower dropped from\none of the trees, falling straight as a plummet through the motionless\nair, and settling upon the gravelled walk with a faint rustling sound.\nOtherwise the stillness was profound.\n\nA little later, the priest's cigar, long since out, slipped from his\nfingers to the ground. He began to nod gently. Vanamee touched his arm.\n\n“Asleep, sir?”\n\nThe other started, rubbing his eyes.\n\n“Upon my word, I believe I was.”\n\n“Better go to bed, sir. I am not tired. I think I shall sit out here a\nlittle longer.”\n\n“Well, perhaps I would be better off in bed. YOUR bed is always ready\nfor you here whenever you want to use it.”\n\n“No--I shall go back to Quien Sabe--later. Good-night, sir.”\n\n“Good-night, my boy.”\n\nVanamee was left alone. For a long time he sat motionless in his place,\nhis elbows on his knees, his chin propped in his hands. The minutes\npassed--then the hours. The moon climbed steadily higher among the\nstars. Vanamee rolled and smoked cigarette after cigarette, the blue\nhaze of smoke hanging motionless above his head, or drifting in slowly\nweaving filaments across the open spaces of the garden.\n\nBut the influence of the old enclosure, this corner of romance and\nmystery, this isolated garden of dreams, savouring of the past, with its\nlegends, its graves, its crumbling sun dial, its fountain with its rime\nof moss, was not to be resisted. Now that the priest had left him, the\nsame exaltation of spirit that had seized upon Vanamee earlier in the\nevening, by degrees grew big again in his mind and imagination. His\nsorrow assaulted him like the flagellations of a fine whiplash, and his\nlove for Angele rose again in his heart, it seemed to him never so deep,\nso tender, so infinitely strong. No doubt, it was his familiarity with\nthe Mission garden, his clear-cut remembrance of it, as it was in the\ndays when he had met Angele there, tallying now so exactly with the\nreality there under his eyes, that brought her to his imagination so\nvividly. As yet he dared not trust himself near her grave, but, for the\nmoment, he rose and, his hands clasped behind him, walked slowly from\npoint to point amid the tiny gravelled walks, recalling the incidents of\neighteen years ago. On the bench he had quitted he and Angele had often\nsat. Here by the crumbling sun dial, he recalled the night when he had\nkissed her for the first time. Here, again, by the rim of the fountain,\nwith its fringe of green, she once had paused, and, baring her arm to\nthe shoulder, had thrust it deep into the water, and then withdrawing\nit, had given it to him to kiss, all wet and cool; and here, at last,\nunder the shadow of the pear trees they had sat, evening after evening,\nlooking off over the little valley below them, watching the night build\nitself, dome-like, from horizon to zenith.\n\nBrusquely Vanamee turned away from the prospect. The Seed ranch was dark\nat this time of the year, and flowerless. Far off toward its centre, he\nhad caught a brief glimpse of the house where Angele had lived, and a\nfaint light burning in its window. But he turned from it sharply. The\ndeep-seated travail of his grief abruptly reached the paroxysm. With\nlong strides he crossed the garden and reentered the Mission church\nitself, plunging into the coolness of its atmosphere as into a bath.\nWhat he searched for he did not know, or, rather, did not define. He\nknew only that he was suffering, that a longing for Angele, for some\nobject around which his great love could enfold itself, was tearing\nat his heart with iron teeth. He was ready to be deluded; craved the\nhallucination; begged pitifully for the illusion; anything rather than\nthe empty, tenantless night, the voiceless silence, the vast loneliness\nof the overspanning arc of the heavens.\n\nBefore the chancel rail of the altar, under the sanctuary lamp, Vanamee\nsank upon his knees, his arms folded upon the rail, his head bowed down\nupon them. He prayed, with what words he could not say for what he did\nnot understand--for help, merely, for relief, for an Answer to his cry.\n\nIt was upon that, at length, that his disordered mind concentrated\nitself, an Answer--he demanded, he implored an Answer. Not a vague\nvisitation of Grace, not a formless sense of Peace; but an Answer,\nsomething real, even if the reality were fancied, a voice out of the\nnight, responding to his, a hand in the dark clasping his groping\nfingers, a breath, human, warm, fragrant, familiar, like a soft, sweet\ncaress on his shrunken cheeks. Alone there in the dim half-light of\nthe decaying Mission, with its crumbling plaster, its naive crudity\nof ornament and picture, he wrestled fiercely with his desires--words,\nfragments of sentences, inarticulate, incoherent, wrenched from his\ntight-shut teeth.\n\nBut the Answer was not in the church. Above him, over the high altar,\nthe Virgin in a glory, with downcast eyes and folded hands, grew vague\nand indistinct in the shadow, the colours fading, tarnished by centuries\nof incense smoke. The Christ in agony on the Cross was but a lamentable\nvision of tormented anatomy, grey flesh, spotted with crimson. The St.\nJohn, the San Juan Bautista, patron saint of the Mission, the gaunt\nfigure in skins, two fingers upraised in the gesture of benediction,\ngazed stolidly out into the half-gloom under the ceiling, ignoring the\nhuman distress that beat itself in vain against the altar rail below,\nand Angele remained as before--only a memory, far distant, intangible,\nlost.\n\nVanamee rose, turning his back upon the altar with a vague gesture of\ndespair. He crossed the church, and issuing from the low-arched door\nopposite the pulpit, once more stepped out into the garden. Here, at\nleast, was reality. The warm, still air descended upon him like a cloak,\ngrateful, comforting, dispelling the chill that lurked in the damp mould\nof plaster and crumbling adobe.\n\nBut now he found his way across the garden on the other side of the\nfountain, where, ranged against the eastern wall, were nine graves.\nHere Angele was buried, in the smallest grave of them all, marked by the\nlittle headstone, with its two dates, only sixteen years apart. To this\nspot, at last, he had returned, after the years spent in the desert, the\nwilderness--after all the wanderings of the Long Trail. Here, if ever,\nhe must have a sense of her nearness. Close at hand, a short four feet\nunder that mound of grass, was the form he had so often held in the\nembrace of his arms; the face, the very face he had kissed, that face\nwith the hair of gold making three-cornered the round white forehead,\nthe violet-blue eyes, heavy-lidded, with their strange oriental slant\nupward toward the temples; the sweet full lips, almost Egyptian in their\nfulness--all that strange, perplexing, wonderful beauty, so troublous,\nso enchanting, so out of all accepted standards.\n\nHe bent down, dropping upon one knee, a hand upon the headstone, and\nread again the inscription. Then instinctively his hand left the stone\nand rested upon the low mound of turf, touching it with the softness of\na caress; and then, before he was aware of it, he was stretched at full\nlength upon the earth, beside the grave, his arms about the low mound,\nhis lips pressed against the grass with which it was covered. The\npent-up grief of nearly twenty years rose again within his heart, and\noverflowed, irresistible, violent, passionate. There was no one to\nsee, no one to hear. Vanamee had no thought of restraint. He no longer\nwrestled with his pain--strove against it. There was even a sense of\nrelief in permitting himself to be overcome. But the reaction from this\noutburst was equally violent. His revolt against the inevitable, his\nprotest against the grave, shook him from head to foot, goaded him\nbeyond all bounds of reason, hounded him on and into the domain of\nhysteria, dementia. Vanamee was no longer master of himself--no longer\nknew what he was doing.\n\nAt first, he had been content with merely a wild, unreasoned cry to\nHeaven that Angele should be restored to him, but the vast egotism that\nseems to run through all forms of disordered intelligence gave his\nfancy another turn. He forgot God. He no longer reckoned with Heaven. He\narrogated their powers to himself--struggled to be, of his own unaided\nmight, stronger than death, more powerful than the grave. He had\ndemanded of Sarria that God should restore Angele to him, but now he\nappealed directly to Angele herself. As he lay there, his arms clasped\nabout her grave, she seemed so near to him that he fancied she MUST\nhear. And suddenly, at this moment, his recollection of his strange\ncompelling power--the same power by which he had called Presley to him\nhalf-way across the Quien Sabe ranch, the same power which had brought\nSarria to his side that very evening--recurred to him. Concentrating his\nmind upon the one object with which it had so long been filled, Vanamee,\nhis eyes closed, his face buried in his arms, exclaimed:\n\n“Come to me--Angele--don't you hear? Come to me.”\n\nBut the Answer was not in the Grave. Below him the voiceless Earth lay\nsilent, moveless, withholding the secret, jealous of that which it held\nso close in its grip, refusing to give up that which had been confided\nto its keeping, untouched by the human anguish that above there, on its\nsurface, clutched with despairing hands at a grave long made. The Earth\nthat only that morning had been so eager, so responsive to the lightest\nsummons, so vibrant with Life, now at night, holding death within its\nembrace, guarding inviolate the secret of the Grave, was deaf to all\nentreaty, refused the Answer, and Angele remained as before, only a\nmemory, far distant, intangible, lost.\n\nVanamee lifted his head, looking about him with unseeing eyes, trembling\nwith the exertion of his vain effort. But he could not as yet allow\nhimself to despair. Never before had that curious power of attraction\nfailed him. He felt himself to be so strong in this respect that he\nwas persuaded if he exerted himself to the limit of his capacity,\nsomething--he could not say what--must come of it. If it was only\na self-delusion, an hallucination, he told himself that he would be\ncontent.\n\nAlmost of its own accord, his distorted mind concentrated itself again,\nevery thought, all the power of his will riveting themselves upon\nAngele. As if she were alive, he summoned her to him. His eyes, fixed\nupon the name cut into the headstone, contracted, the pupils growing\nsmall, his fists shut tight, his nerves braced rigid.\n\nFor a few seconds he stood thus, breathless, expectant, awaiting the\nmanifestation, the Miracle. Then, without knowing why, hardly conscious\nof what was transpiring, he found that his glance was leaving the\nheadstone, was turning from the grave. Not only this, but his whole\nbody was following the direction of his eyes. Before he knew it, he was\nstanding with his back to Angele's grave, was facing the north, facing\nthe line of pear trees and the little valley where the Seed ranch lay.\nAt first, he thought this was because he had allowed his will to weaken,\nthe concentrated power of his mind to grow slack. And once more turning\ntoward the grave, he banded all his thoughts together in a consummate\neffort, his teeth grinding together, his hands pressed to his forehead.\nHe forced himself to the notion that Angele was alive, and to this\ncreature of his imagination he addressed himself:\n\n“Angele!” he cried in a low voice; “Angele, I am calling you--do you\nhear? Come to me--come to me now, now.”\n\nInstead of the Answer he demanded, that inexplicable counter-influence\ncut across the current of his thought. Strive as he would against it,\nhe must veer to the north, toward the pear trees. Obeying it, he turned,\nand, still wondering, took a step in that direction, then another and\nanother. The next moment he came abruptly to himself, in the black\nshadow of the pear trees themselves, and, opening his eyes, found\nhimself looking off over the Seed ranch, toward the little house in the\ncentre where Angele had once lived.\n\nPerplexed, he returned to the grave, once more calling upon the\nresources of his will, and abruptly, so soon as these reached a certain\npoint, the same cross-current set in. He could no longer keep his eyes\nupon the headstone, could no longer think of the grave and what it held.\nHe must face the north; he must be drawn toward the pear trees, and\nthere left standing in their shadow, looking out aimlessly over the Seed\nranch, wondering, bewildered. Farther than this the influence never\ndrew him, but up to this point--the line of pear trees--it was not to be\nresisted.\n\nFor a time the peculiarity of the affair was of more interest to Vanamee\nthan even his own distress of spirit, and once or twice he repeated the\nattempt, almost experimentally, and invariably with the same result: so\nsoon as he seemed to hold Angele in the grip of his mind, he was moved\nto turn about toward the north, and hurry toward the pear trees on the\ncrest of the hill that over-looked the little valley.\n\nBut Vanamee's unhappiness was too keen this night for him to dwell long\nupon the vagaries of his mind. Submitting at length, and abandoning the\ngrave, he flung himself down in the black shade of the pear trees, his\nchin in his hands, and resigned himself finally and definitely to the\ninrush of recollection and the exquisite grief of an infinite regret.\n\nTo his fancy, she came to him again. He put himself back many years. He\nremembered the warm nights of July and August, profoundly still, the\nsky encrusted with stars, the little Mission garden exhaling the mingled\nperfumes that all through the scorching day had been distilled under\nthe steady blaze of a summer's sun. He saw himself as another person,\narriving at this, their rendezvous. All day long she had been in\nhis mind. All day long he had looked forward to this quiet hour that\nbelonged to her. It was dark. He could see nothing, but, by and by,\nhe heard a step, a gentle rustle of the grass on the slope of the hill\npressed under an advancing foot. Then he saw the faint gleam of pallid\ngold of her hair, a barely visible glow in the starlight, and heard the\nmurmur of her breath in the lapse of the over-passing breeze. And then,\nin the midst of the gentle perfumes of the garden, the perfumes of the\nmagnolia flowers, of the mignonette borders, of the crumbling walls,\nthere expanded a new odour, or the faint mingling of many odours, the\nsmell of the roses that lingered in her hair, of the lilies that exhaled\nfrom her neck, of the heliotrope that disengaged itself from her hands\nand arms, and of the hyacinths with which her little feet were redolent,\nAnd then, suddenly, it was herself--her eyes, heavy-lidded, violet blue,\nfull of the love of him; her sweet full lips speaking his name; her\nhands clasping his hands, his shoulders, his neck--her whole dear body\ngiving itself into his embrace; her lips against his; her hands holding\nhis head, drawing his face down to hers.\n\nVanamee, as he remembered all this, flung out an arm with a cry of pain,\nhis eyes searching the gloom, all his mind in strenuous mutiny against\nthe triumph of Death. His glance shot swiftly out across the night,\nunconsciously following the direction from which Angele used to come to\nhim.\n\n“Come to me now,” he exclaimed under his breath, tense and rigid with\nthe vast futile effort of his will. “Come to me now, now. Don't you hear\nme, Angele? You must, you must come.”\n\nSuddenly Vanamee returned to himself with the abruptness of a blow.\nHis eyes opened. He half raised himself from the ground. Swiftly his\nscattered wits readjusted themselves. Never more sane, never more\nhimself, he rose to his feet and stood looking off into the night across\nthe Seed ranch.\n\n“What was it?” he murmured, bewildered.\n\nHe looked around him from side to side, as if to get in touch with\nreality once more. He looked at his hands, at the rough bark of the pear\ntree next which he stood, at the streaked and rain-eroded walls of\nthe Mission and garden. The exaltation of his mind calmed itself; the\nunnatural strain under which he laboured slackened. He became thoroughly\nmaster of himself again, matter-of-fact, practical, keen.\n\nBut just so sure as his hands were his own, just so sure as the bark\nof the pear tree was rough, the mouldering adobe of the Mission walls\ndamp--just so sure had Something occurred. It was vague, intangible,\nappealing only to some strange, nameless sixth sense, but none the less\nperceptible. His mind, his imagination, sent out from him across the\nnight, across the little valley below him, speeding hither and thither\nthrough the dark, lost, confused, had suddenly paused, hovering, had\nfound Something. It had not returned to him empty-handed. It had come\nback, but now there was a change--mysterious, illusive. There were no\nwords for this that had transpired. But for the moment, one thing only\nwas certain. The night was no longer voiceless, the dark was no longer\nempty. Far off there, beyond the reach of vision, unlocalised, strange,\na ripple had formed on the still black pool of the night, had formed,\nflashed one instant to the stars, then swiftly faded again. The night\nshut down once more. There was no sound--nothing stirred.\n\nFor the moment, Vanamee stood transfixed, struck rigid in his place,\nstupefied, his eyes staring, breathless with utter amazement. Then,\nstep by step, he shrank back into the deeper shadow, treading with the\ninfinite precaution of a prowling leopard. A qualm of something very\nmuch like fear seized upon him. But immediately on the heels of this\nfirst impression came the doubt of his own senses. Whatever had happened\nhad been so ephemeral, so faint, so intangible, that now he wondered\nif he had not deceived himself, after all. But the reaction followed.\nSurely, there had been Something. And from that moment began for him\nthe most poignant uncertainty of mind. Gradually he drew back into the\ngarden, holding his breath, listening to every faintest sound, walking\nupon tiptoe. He reached the fountain, and wetting his hands, passed them\nacross his forehead and eyes. Once more he stood listening. The silence\nwas profound.\n\nTroubled, disturbed, Vanamee went away, passing out of the garden,\ndescending the hill. He forded Broderson Creek where it intersected the\nroad to Guadalajara, and went on across Quien Sabe, walking slowly,\nhis head bent down, his hands clasped behind his back, thoughtful,\nperplexed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nAt seven o'clock, in the bedroom of his ranch house, in the\nwhite-painted iron bedstead with its blue-grey army blankets and red\ncounterpane, Annixter was still asleep, his face red, his mouth open,\nhis stiff yellow hair in wild disorder. On the wooden chair at the\nbed-head, stood the kerosene lamp, by the light of which he had been\nreading the previous evening. Beside it was a paper bag of dried prunes,\nand the limp volume of “Copperfield,” the place marked by a slip of\npaper torn from the edge of the bag.\n\nAnnixter slept soundly, making great work of the business, unable to\ntake even his rest gracefully. His eyes were shut so tight that the skin\nat their angles was drawn into puckers. Under his pillow, his two\nhands were doubled up into fists. At intervals, he gritted his teeth\nferociously, while, from time to time, the abrupt sound of his snoring\ndominated the brisk ticking of the alarm clock that hung from the brass\nknob of the bed-post, within six inches of his ear.\n\nBut immediately after seven, this clock sprung its alarm with the\nabruptness of an explosion, and within the second, Annixter had hurled\nthe bed-clothes from him and flung himself up to a sitting posture on\nthe edge of the bed, panting and gasping, blinking at the light, rubbing\nhis head, dazed and bewildered, stupefied at the hideous suddenness with\nwhich he had been wrenched from his sleep.\n\nHis first act was to take down the alarm clock and stifle its prolonged\nwhirring under the pillows and blankets. But when this had been done, he\ncontinued to sit stupidly on the edge of the bed, curling his toes away\nfrom the cold of the floor; his half-shut eyes, heavy with sleep, fixed\nand vacant, closing and opening by turns. For upwards of three minutes\nhe alternately dozed and woke, his head and the whole upper half of his\nbody sagging abruptly sideways from moment to moment. But at length,\ncoming more to himself, he straightened up, ran his fingers through his\nhair, and with a prodigious yawn, murmured vaguely:\n\n“Oh, Lord! Oh-h, LORD!”\n\nHe stretched three or four times, twisting about in his place, curling\nand uncurling his toes, muttering from time to time between two yawns:\n\n“Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!”\n\nHe stared about the room, collecting his thoughts, readjusting himself\nfor the day's work.\n\nThe room was barren, the walls of tongue-and-groove sheathing--alternate\nbrown and yellow boards--like the walls of a stable, were adorned with\ntwo or three unframed lithographs, the Christmas “souvenirs” of weekly\nperiodicals, fastened with great wire nails; a bunch of herbs or\nflowers, lamentably withered and grey with dust, was affixed to the\nmirror over the black walnut washstand by the window, and a yellowed\nphotograph of Annixter's combined harvester--himself and his men in a\ngroup before it--hung close at hand. On the floor, at the bedside and\nbefore the bureau, were two oval rag-carpet rugs. In the corners of\nthe room were muddy boots, a McClellan saddle, a surveyor's transit, an\nempty coal-hod and a box of iron bolts and nuts. On the wall over the\nbed, in a gilt frame, was Annixter's college diploma, while on the\nbureau, amid a litter of hair-brushes, dirty collars, driving gloves,\ncigars and the like, stood a broken machine for loading shells.\n\nIt was essentially a man's room, rugged, uncouth, virile, full of the\nodours of tobacco, of leather, of rusty iron; the bare floor hollowed by\nthe grind of hob-nailed boots, the walls marred by the friction of heavy\nthings of metal. Strangely enough, Annixter's clothes were disposed\nof on the single chair with the precision of an old maid. Thus he had\nplaced them the night before; the boots set carefully side by side, the\ntrousers, with the overalls still upon them, neatly folded upon the seat\nof the chair, the coat hanging from its back.\n\nThe Quien Sabe ranch house was a six-room affair, all on one floor. By\nno excess of charity could it have been called a home. Annixter was a\nwealthy man; he could have furnished his dwelling with quite as much\nelegance as that of Magnus Derrick. As it was, however, he considered\nhis house merely as a place to eat, to sleep, to change his clothes\nin; as a shelter from the rain, an office where business was\ntransacted--nothing more.\n\nWhen he was sufficiently awake, Annixter thrust his feet into a pair of\nwicker slippers, and shuffled across the office adjoining his bedroom,\nto the bathroom just beyond, and stood under the icy shower a few\nminutes, his teeth chattering, fulminating oaths at the coldness of the\nwater. Still shivering, he hurried into his clothes, and, having pushed\nthe button of the electric bell to announce that he was ready for\nbreakfast, immediately plunged into the business of the day. While he\nwas thus occupied, the butcher's cart from Bonneville drove into\nthe yard with the day's supply of meat. This cart also brought the\nBonneville paper and the mail of the previous night. In the bundle of\ncorrespondence that the butcher handed to Annixter that morning, was a\ntelegram from Osterman, at that time on his second trip to Los Angeles.\nIt read:\n\n\n“Flotation of company in this district assured. Have secured services of\ndesirable party. Am now in position to sell you your share stock, as per\noriginal plan.”\n\n\nAnnixter grunted as he tore the despatch into strips. “Well,” he\nmuttered, “that part is settled, then.”\n\nHe made a little pile of the torn strips on the top of the unlighted\nstove, and burned them carefully, scowling down into the flicker of\nfire, thoughtful and preoccupied.\n\nHe knew very well what Osterman referred to by “Flotation of company,”\n and also who was the “desirable party” he spoke of.\n\nUnder protest, as he was particular to declare, and after interminable\nargument, Annixter had allowed himself to be reconciled with Osterman,\nand to be persuaded to reenter the proposed political “deal.” A\ncommittee had been formed to finance the affair--Osterman, old\nBroderson, Annixter himself, and, with reservations, hardly more than\na looker-on, Harran Derrick. Of this committee, Osterman was considered\nchairman. Magnus Derrick had formally and definitely refused his\nadherence to the scheme. He was trying to steer a middle course. His\nposition was difficult, anomalous. If freight rates were cut through the\nefforts of the members of the committee, he could not very well avoid\ntaking advantage of the new schedule. He would be the gainer, though\nsharing neither the risk nor the expense. But, meanwhile, the days were\npassing; the primary elections were drawing nearer. The committee could\nnot afford to wait, and by way of a beginning, Osterman had gone to Los\nAngeles, fortified by a large sum of money--a purse to which Annixter,\nBroderson and himself had contributed. He had put himself in touch with\nDisbrow, the political man of the Denver, Pueblo and Mojave road, and\nhad had two interviews with him. The telegram that Annixter received\nthat morning was to say that Disbrow had been bought over, and would\nadopt Parrell as the D., P. and M. candidate for Railroad Commissioner\nfrom the third district.\n\nOne of the cooks brought up Annixter's breakfast that morning, and he\nwent through it hastily, reading his mail at the same time and glancing\nover the pages of the “Mercury,” Genslinger's paper. The “Mercury,”\n Annixter was persuaded, received a subsidy from the Pacific and\nSouthwestern Railroad, and was hardly better than the mouthpiece\nby which Shelgrim and the General Office spoke to ranchers about\nBonneville.\n\nAn editorial in that morning's issue said:\n\n“It would not be surprising to the well-informed, if the long-deferred\nre-grade of the value of the railroad sections included in the Los\nMuertos, Quien Sabe, Osterman and Broderson properties was made before\nthe first of the year. Naturally, the tenants of these lands feel an\ninterest in the price which the railroad will put upon its holdings,\nand it is rumoured they expect the land will be offered to them for\ntwo dollars and fifty cents per acre. It needs no seventh daughter of a\nseventh daughter to foresee that these gentlemen will be disappointed.”\n\n“Rot!” vociferated Annixter to himself as he finished. He rolled the\npaper into a wad and hurled it from him.\n\n“Rot! rot! What does Genslinger know about it? I stand on my agreement\nwith the P. and S. W.--from two fifty to five dollars an acre--there\nit is in black and white. The road IS obligated. And my improvements! I\nmade the land valuable by improving it, irrigating it, draining it, and\ncultivating it. Talk to ME. I know better.”\n\nThe most abiding impression that Genslinger's editorial made upon him\nwas, that possibly the “Mercury” was not subsidised by the corporation\nafter all. If it was; Genslinger would not have been led into making\nhis mistake as to the value of the land. He would have known that the\nrailroad was under contract to sell at two dollars and a half an acre,\nand not only this, but that when the land was put upon the market, it\nwas to be offered to the present holders first of all. Annixter called\nto mind the explicit terms of the agreement between himself and the\nrailroad, and dismissed the matter from his mind. He lit a cigar, put on\nhis hat and went out.\n\nThe morning was fine, the air nimble, brisk. On the summit of the\nskeleton-like tower of the artesian well, the windmill was turning\nsteadily in a breeze from the southwest. The water in the irrigating\nditch was well up. There was no cloud in the sky. Far off to the east\nand west, the bulwarks of the valley, the Coast Range and the foothills\nof the Sierras stood out, pale amethyst against the delicate pink and\nwhite sheen of the horizon. The sunlight was a veritable flood, crystal,\nlimpid, sparkling, setting a feeling of gayety in the air, stirring up\nan effervescence in the blood, a tumult of exuberance in the veins.\n\nBut on his way to the barns, Annixter was obliged to pass by the open\ndoor of the dairy-house. Hilma Tree was inside, singing at her work;\nher voice of a velvety huskiness, more of the chest than of the throat,\nmingling with the liquid dashing of the milk in the vats and churns, and\nthe clear, sonorous clinking of the cans and pans. Annixter turned into\nthe dairy-house, pausing on the threshold, looking about him. Hilma\nstood bathed from head to foot in the torrent of sunlight that poured in\nupon her from the three wide-open windows. She was charming, delicious,\nradiant of youth, of health, of well-being. Into her eyes, wide open,\nbrown, rimmed with their fine, thin line of intense black lashes, the\nsun set a diamond flash; the same golden light glowed all around her\nthick, moist hair, lambent, beautiful, a sheen of almost metallic\nlustre, and reflected itself upon her wet lips, moving with the words\nof her singing. The whiteness of her skin under the caress of this hale,\nvigorous morning light was dazzling, pure, of a fineness beyond words.\nBeneath the sweet modulation of her chin, the reflected light from the\nburnished copper vessel she was carrying set a vibration of pale gold.\nOverlaying the flush of rose in her cheeks, seen only when she stood\nagainst the sunlight, was a faint sheen of down, a lustrous floss,\ndelicate as the pollen of a flower, or the impalpable powder of a moth's\nwing. She was moving to and fro about her work, alert, joyous, robust;\nand from all the fine, full amplitude of her figure, from her thick\nwhite neck, sloping downward to her shoulders, from the deep, feminine\nswell of her breast, the vigorous maturity of her hips, there was\ndisengaged a vibrant note of gayety, of exuberant animal life, sane,\nhonest, strong. She wore a skirt of plain blue calico and a shirtwaist\nof pink linen, clean, trim; while her sleeves turned back to her\nshoulders, showed her large, white arms, wet with milk, redolent and\nfragrant with milk, glowing and resplendent in the early morning light.\n\nOn the threshold, Annixter took off his hat.\n\n“Good morning, Miss Hilma.”\n\nHilma, who had set down the copper can on top of the vat, turned about\nquickly.\n\n“Oh, GOOD morning, sir;” and, unconsciously, she made a little gesture\nof salutation with her hand, raising it part way toward her head, as a\nman would have done.\n\n“Well,” began Annixter vaguely, “how are you getting along down here?”\n\n“Oh, very fine. To-day, there is not so much to do. We drew the whey\nhours ago, and now we are just done putting the curd to press. I have\nbeen cleaning. See my pans. Wouldn't they do for mirrors, sir? And the\ncopper things. I have scrubbed and scrubbed. Oh, you can look into the\ntiniest corners, everywhere, you won't find so much as the littlest\nspeck of dirt or grease. I love CLEAN things, and this room is my own\nparticular place. Here I can do just as I please, and that is, to keep\nthe cement floor, and the vats, and the churns and the separators, and\nespecially the cans and coppers, clean; clean, and to see that the milk\nis pure, oh, so that a little baby could drink it; and to have the air\nalways sweet, and the sun--oh, lots and lots of sun, morning, noon and\nafternoon, so that everything shines. You know, I never see the sun set\nthat it don't make me a little sad; yes, always, just a little. Isn't\nit funny? I should want it to be day all the time. And when the day is\ngloomy and dark, I am just as sad as if a very good friend of mine had\nleft me. Would you believe it? Just until within a few years, when I\nwas a big girl, sixteen and over, mamma had to sit by my bed every night\nbefore I could go to sleep. I was afraid in the dark. Sometimes I am\nnow. Just imagine, and now I am nineteen--a young lady.”\n\n“You were, hey?” observed Annixter, for the sake of saying something.\n“Afraid in the dark? What of--ghosts?”\n\n“N-no; I don't know what. I wanted the light, I wanted----” She drew\na deep breath, turning towards the window and spreading her pink\nfinger-tips to the light. “Oh, the SUN. I love the sun. See, put your\nhand there--here on the top of the vat--like that. Isn't it warm? Isn't\nit fine? And don't you love to see it coming in like that through the\nwindows, floods of it; and all the little dust in it shining? Where\nthere is lots of sunlight, I think the people must be very good. It's\nonly wicked people that love the dark. And the wicked things are always\ndone and planned in the dark, I think. Perhaps, too, that's why I hate\nthings that are mysterious--things that I can't see, that happen in the\ndark.” She wrinkled her nose with a little expression of aversion. “I\nhate a mystery. Maybe that's why I am afraid in the dark--or was. I\nshouldn't like to think that anything could happen around me that I\ncouldn't see or understand or explain.”\n\nShe ran on from subject to subject, positively garrulous, talking in her\nlow-pitched voice of velvety huskiness for the mere enjoyment of putting\nher ideas into speech, innocently assuming that they were quite as\ninteresting to others as to herself. She was yet a great child, ignoring\nthe fact that she had ever grown up, taking a child's interest in her\nimmediate surroundings, direct, straightforward, plain. While speaking,\nshe continued about her work, rinsing out the cans with a mixture of hot\nwater and soda, scouring them bright, and piling them in the sunlight on\ntop of the vat.\n\nObliquely, and from between his narrowed lids, Annixter scrutinised her\nfrom time to time, more and more won over by her adorable freshness,\nher clean, fine youth. The clumsiness that he usually experienced in the\npresence of women was wearing off. Hilma Tree's direct simplicity put\nhim at his ease. He began to wonder if he dared to kiss Hilma, and if\nhe did dare, how she would take it. A spark of suspicion flickered up\nin his mind. Did not her manner imply, vaguely, an invitation? One\nnever could tell with feemales. That was why she was talking so much, no\ndoubt, holding him there, affording the opportunity. Aha! She had best\nlook out, or he would take her at her word.\n\n“Oh, I had forgotten,” suddenly exclaimed Hilma, “the very thing I\nwanted to show you--the new press. You remember I asked for one last\nmonth? This is it. See, this is how it works. Here is where the curds\ngo; look. And this cover is screwed down like this, and then you work\nthe lever this way.” She grasped the lever in both hands, throwing her\nweight upon it, her smooth, bare arm swelling round and firm with the\neffort, one slim foot, in its low shoe set off with the bright, steel\nbuckle, braced against the wall.\n\n“My, but that takes strength,” she panted, looking up at him and\nsmiling. “But isn't it a fine press? Just what we needed.”\n\n“And,” Annixter cleared his throat, “and where do you keep the cheeses\nand the butter?” He thought it very likely that these were in the cellar\nof the dairy.\n\n“In the cellar,” answered Hilma. “Down here, see?” She raised the flap\nof the cellar door at the end of the room. “Would you like to see? Come\ndown; I'll show you.”\n\nShe went before him down into the cool obscurity underneath, redolent\nof new cheese and fresh butter. Annixter followed, a certain excitement\nbeginning to gain upon him. He was almost sure now that Hilma wanted him\nto kiss her. At all events, one could but try. But, as yet, he was not\nabsolutely sure. Suppose he had been mistaken in her; suppose she should\nconsider herself insulted and freeze him with an icy stare. Annixter\nwinced at the very thought of it. Better let the whole business go, and\nget to work. He was wasting half the morning. Yet, if she DID want to\ngive him the opportunity of kissing her, and he failed to take advantage\nof it, what a ninny she would think him; she would despise him for being\nafraid. He afraid! He, Annixter, afraid of a fool, feemale girl. Why,\nhe owed it to himself as a man to go as far as he could. He told himself\nthat that goat Osterman would have kissed Hilma Tree weeks ago. To test\nhis state of mind, he imagined himself as having decided to kiss her,\nafter all, and at once was surprised to experience a poignant qualm of\nexcitement, his heart beating heavily, his breath coming short. At the\nsame time, his courage remained with him. He was not afraid to try. He\nfelt a greater respect for himself because of this. His self-assurance\nhardened within him, and as Hilma turned to him, asking him to taste\na cut from one of the ripe cheeses, he suddenly stepped close to her,\nthrowing an arm about her shoulders, advancing his head.\n\nBut at the last second, he bungled, hesitated; Hilma shrank from him,\nsupple as a young reed; Annixter clutched harshly at her arm, and trod\nhis full weight upon one of her slender feet, his cheek and chin barely\ntouching the delicate pink lobe of one of her ears, his lips brushing\nmerely a fold of her shirt waist between neck and shoulder. The thing\nwas a failure, and at once he realised that nothing had been further\nfrom Hilma's mind than the idea of his kissing her.\n\nShe started back from him abruptly, her hands nervously clasped against\nher breast, drawing in her breath sharply and holding it with a little,\ntremulous catch of the throat that sent a quivering vibration the length\nof her smooth, white neck. Her eyes opened wide with a childlike look,\nmore of astonishment than anger. She was surprised, out of all measure,\ndiscountenanced, taken all aback, and when she found her breath, gave\nvoice to a great “Oh” of dismay and distress.\n\nFor an instant, Annixter stood awkwardly in his place, ridiculous,\nclumsy, murmuring over and over again:\n\n“Well--well--that's all right--who's going to hurt you? You needn't be\nafraid--who's going to hurt you--that's all right.”\n\nThen, suddenly, with a quick, indefinite gesture of one arm, he\nexclaimed:\n\n“Good-bye, I--I'm sorry.”\n\nHe turned away, striding up the stairs, crossing the dairy-room, and\nregained the open air, raging and furious. He turned toward the barns,\nclapping his hat upon his head, muttering the while under his breath:\n\n“Oh, you goat! You beastly fool PIP. Good LORD, what an ass you've made\nof yourself now!”\n\nSuddenly he resolved to put Hilma Tree out of his thoughts. The matter\nwas interfering with his work. This kind of thing was sure not earning\nany money. He shook himself as though freeing his shoulders of an\nirksome burden, and turned his entire attention to the work nearest at\nhand.\n\nThe prolonged rattle of the shinglers' hammers upon the roof of the big\nbarn attracted him, and, crossing over between the ranch house and the\nartesian well, he stood for some time absorbed in the contemplation\nof the vast building, amused and interested with the confusion of\nsounds--the clatter of hammers, the cadenced scrape of saws, and the\nrhythmic shuffle of planes--that issued from the gang of carpenters who\nwere at that moment putting the finishing touches upon the roof and rows\nof stalls. A boy and two men were busy hanging the great sliding door at\nthe south end, while the painters--come down from Bonneville early that\nmorning--were engaged in adjusting the spray and force engine, by means\nof which Annixter had insisted upon painting the vast surfaces of\nthe barn, condemning the use of brushes and pots for such work as\nold-fashioned and out-of-date.\n\nHe called to one of the foremen, to ask when the barn would be entirely\nfinished, and was told that at the end of the week the hay and stock\ncould be installed.\n\n“And a precious long time you've been at it, too,” Annixter declared.\n\n“Well, you know the rain----”\n\n“Oh, rot the rain! I work in the rain. You and your unions make me\nsick.”\n\n“But, Mr. Annixter, we couldn't have begun painting in the rain. The job\nwould have been spoiled.”\n\n“Hoh, yes, spoiled. That's all very well. Maybe it would, and then,\nagain, maybe it wouldn't.”\n\nBut when the foreman had left him, Annixter could not forbear a growl\nof satisfaction. It could not be denied that the barn was superb,\nmonumental even. Almost any one of the other barns in the county could\nbe swung, bird-cage fashion, inside of it, with room to spare. In every\nsense, the barn was precisely what Annixter had hoped of it. In his\npleasure over the success of his idea, even Hilma for the moment was\nforgotten.\n\n“And, now,” murmured Annixter, “I'll give that dance in it. I'll make\n'em sit up.”\n\nIt occurred to him that he had better set about sending out the\ninvitations for the affair. He was puzzled to decide just how the thing\nshould be managed, and resolved that it might be as well to consult\nMagnus and Mrs. Derrick.\n\n“I want to talk of this telegram of the goat's with Magnus, anyhow,”\n he said to himself reflectively, “and there's things I got to do in\nBonneville before the first of the month.”\n\nHe turned about on his heel with a last look at the barn, and set off\ntoward the stable. He had decided to have his horse saddled and ride\nover to Bonneville by way of Los Muertos. He would make a day of it,\nwould see Magnus, Harran, old Broderson and some of the business men of\nBonneville.\n\nA few moments later, he rode out of the barn and the stable-yard, a\nfresh cigar between his teeth, his hat slanted over his face against the\nrays of the sun, as yet low in the east. He crossed the irrigating ditch\nand gained the trail--the short cut over into Los Muertos, by way\nof Hooven's. It led south and west into the low ground overgrown by\ngrey-green willows by Broderson Creek, at this time of the rainy season\na stream of considerable volume, farther on dipping sharply to pass\nunderneath the Long Trestle of the railroad. On the other side of the\nright of way, Annixter was obliged to open the gate in Derrick's line\nfence. He managed this without dismounting, swearing at the horse\nthe while, and spurring him continually. But once inside the gate he\ncantered forward briskly.\n\nThis part of Los Muertos was Hooven's holding, some five hundred acres\nenclosed between the irrigating ditch and Broderson Creek, and half\nthe way across, Annixter came up with Hooven himself, busily at work\nreplacing a broken washer in his seeder. Upon one of the horses hitched\nto the machine, her hands gripped tightly upon the harness of the\ncollar, Hilda, his little daughter, with her small, hob-nailed boots\nand boy's canvas overalls, sat, exalted and petrified with ecstasy and\nexcitement, her eyes wide opened, her hair in a tangle.\n\n“Hello, Bismarck,” said Annixter, drawing up beside him. “What are\nYOU doing here? I thought the Governor was going to manage without his\ntenants this year.”\n\n“Ach, Meest'r Ennixter,” cried the other, straightening up. “Ach, dat's\nyou, eh? Ach, you bedt he doand menege mitout me. Me, I gotta stay.\nI talk der straighd talk mit der Governor. I fix 'em. Ach, you bedt.\nSieben yahr I hef bei der rench ge-stopped; yais, sir. Efery oder\nsohn-of-a-guhn bei der plaice ged der sach bud me. Eh? Wat you tink von\ndose ting?”\n\n“I think that's a crazy-looking monkey-wrench you've got there,”\n observed Annixter, glancing at the instrument in Hooven's hand.\n\n“Ach, dot wrainch,” returned Hooven. “Soh! Wail, I tell you dose ting\nnow whair I got 'em. Say, you see dot wrainch. Dat's not Emericen\nwrainch at alle. I got 'em at Gravelotte der day we licked der stuffun\noudt der Frainch, ach, you bedt.

Emerica, dat's my gountry now,\nund dere,” he pointed behind him to the house under the mammoth oak tree\non the Lower Road, “dat's my home. Dat's goot enough Vaterland for me.”\n\nAnnixter gathered up the reins, about to go on.\n\n“So you like America, do you, Bismarck?” he said. “Who do you vote for?”\n\n“Emerica? I doand know,” returned the other, insistently. “Dat's my\nhome yonder. Dat's my Vaterland. Alle von we Shairmens yoost like dot.\nShairmany, dot's hell oaf some fine plaice, sure. Budt der Vaterland iss\nvhair der home und der wife und kinder iss. Eh? Yes? Voad? Ach, no. Me,\nI nef'r voad. I doand bodder der haid mit dose ting. I maig der wheat\ngrow, und ged der braid fur der wife und Hilda, dot's all. Dot's me;\ndot's Bismarck.”\n\n“Good-bye,” commented Annixter, moving off.\n\nHooven, the washer replaced, turned to his work again, starting up the\nhorses. The seeder advanced, whirring.\n\n“Ach, Hilda, leedle girl,” he cried, “hold tight bei der shdrap on. Hey\nMULE! Hoop! Gedt oop, you.”\n\nAnnixter cantered on. In a few moments, he had crossed Broderson Creek\nand had entered upon the Home ranch of Los Muertos. Ahead of him, but so\nfar off that the greater portion of its bulk was below the horizon, he\ncould see the Derricks' home, a roof or two between the dull green of\ncypress and eucalyptus. Nothing else was in sight. The brown earth,\nsmooth, unbroken, was as a limitless, mud-coloured ocean. The silence\nwas profound.\n\nThen, at length, Annixter's searching eye made out a blur on the horizon\nto the northward; the blur concentrated itself to a speck; the speck\ngrew by steady degrees to a spot, slowly moving, a note of dull colour,\nbarely darker than the land, but an inky black silhouette as it topped a\nlow rise of ground and stood for a moment outlined against the pale blue\nof the sky. Annixter turned his horse from the road and rode across the\nranch land to meet this new object of interest. As the spot grew larger,\nit resolved itself into constituents, a collection of units; its\nshape grew irregular, fragmentary. A disintegrated, nebulous confusion\nadvanced toward Annixter, preceded, as he discovered on nearer approach,\nby a medley of faint sounds. Now it was no longer a spot, but a column,\na column that moved, accompanied by spots. As Annixter lessened the\ndistance, these spots resolved themselves into buggies or men on\nhorseback that kept pace with the advancing column. There were horses in\nthe column itself. At first glance, it appeared as if there were nothing\nelse, a riderless squadron tramping steadily over the upturned plough\nland of the ranch. But it drew nearer. The horses were in lines, six\nabreast, harnessed to machines. The noise increased, defined itself.\nThere was a shout or two; occasionally a horse blew through his nostrils\nwith a prolonged, vibrating snort. The click and clink of metal work was\nincessant, the machines throwing off a continual rattle of wheels and\ncogs and clashing springs. The column approached nearer; was close at\nhand. The noises mingled to a subdued uproar, a bewildering confusion;\nthe impact of innumerable hoofs was a veritable rumble. Machine after\nmachine appeared; and Annixter, drawing to one side, remained for\nnearly ten minutes watching and interested, while, like an array of\nchariots--clattering, jostling, creaking, clashing, an interminable\nprocession, machine succeeding machine, six-horse team succeeding\nsix-horse team--bustling, hurried--Magnus Derrick's thirty-three grain\ndrills, each with its eight hoes, went clamouring past, like an\nadvance of military, seeding the ten thousand acres of the great ranch;\nfecundating the living soil; implanting deep in the dark womb of the\nEarth the germ of life, the sustenance of a whole world, the food of an\nentire People.\n\nWhen the drills had passed, Annixter turned and rode back to the Lower\nRoad, over the land now thick with seed. He did not wonder that the\nseeding on Los Muertos seemed to be hastily conducted. Magnus and Harran\nDerrick had not yet been able to make up the time lost at the beginning\nof the season, when they had waited so long for the ploughs to arrive.\nThey had been behindhand all the time. On Annixter's ranch, the land\nhad not only been harrowed, as well as seeded, but in some cases,\ncross-harrowed as well. The labour of putting in the vast crop was\nover. Now there was nothing to do but wait, while the seed silently\ngerminated; nothing to do but watch for the wheat to come up.\n\nWhen Annixter reached the ranch house of Los Muertos, under the shade\nof the cypress and eucalyptus trees, he found Mrs. Derrick on the porch,\nseated in a long wicker chair. She had been washing her hair, and the\nlight brown locks that yet retained so much of their brightness, were\ncarefully spread in the sun over the back of her chair. Annixter could\nnot but remark that, spite of her more than fifty years, Annie Derrick\nwas yet rather pretty. Her eyes were still those of a young girl, just\ntouched with an uncertain expression of innocence and inquiry, but as\nher glance fell upon him, he found that that expression changed to one\nof uneasiness, of distrust, almost of aversion.\n\nThe night before this, after Magnus and his wife had gone to bed, they\nhad lain awake for hours, staring up into the dark, talking, talking.\nMagnus had not long been able to keep from his wife the news of the\ncoalition that was forming against the railroad, nor the fact that this\ncoalition was determined to gain its ends by any means at its command.\nHe had told her of Osterman's scheme of a fraudulent election to seat a\nBoard of Railroad Commissioners, who should be nominees of the farming\ninterests. Magnus and his wife had talked this matter over and over\nagain; and the same discussion, begun immediately after supper the\nevening before, had lasted till far into the night.\n\nAt once, Annie Derrick had been seized with a sudden terror lest Magnus,\nafter all, should allow himself to be persuaded; should yield to the\npressure that was every day growing stronger. None better than she knew\nthe iron integrity of her husband's character. None better than she\nremembered how his dearest ambition, that of political preferment, had\nbeen thwarted by his refusal to truckle, to connive, to compromise with\nhis ideas of right. Now, at last, there seemed to be a change. Long\ncontinued oppression, petty tyranny, injustice and extortion had driven\nhim to exasperation. S. Behrman's insults still rankled. He seemed\nnearly ready to countenance Osterman's scheme. The very fact that he\nwas willing to talk of it to her so often and at such great length, was\nproof positive that it occupied his mind. The pity of it, the tragedy\nof it! He, Magnus, the “Governor,” who had been so staunch, so rigidly\nupright, so loyal to his convictions, so bitter in his denunciation of\nthe New Politics, so scathing in his attacks on bribery and corruption\nin high places; was it possible that now, at last, he could be\nbrought to withhold his condemnation of the devious intrigues of the\nunscrupulous, going on there under his very eyes? That Magnus should not\ncommand Harran to refrain from all intercourse with the conspirators,\nhad been a matter of vast surprise to Mrs. Derrick. Time was when Magnus\nwould have forbidden his son to so much as recognise a dishonourable\nman.\n\nBut besides all this, Derrick's wife trembled at the thought of\nher husband and son engaging in so desperate a grapple with the\nrailroad--that great monster, iron-hearted, relentless, infinitely\npowerful. Always it had issued triumphant from the fight; always S.\nBehrman, the Corporation's champion, remained upon the field as victor,\nplacid, unperturbed, unassailable. But now a more terrible struggle than\nany hitherto loomed menacing over the rim of the future; money was to be\nspent like water; personal reputations were to be hazarded in the issue;\nfailure meant ruin in all directions, financial ruin, moral ruin,\nruin of prestige, ruin of character. Success, to her mind, was almost\nimpossible. Annie Derrick feared the railroad. At night, when everything\nelse was still, the distant roar of passing trains echoed across Los\nMuertos, from Guadalajara, from Bonneville, or from the Long Trestle,\nstraight into her heart. At such moments she saw very plainly the\ngalloping terror of steam and steel, with its single eye, cyclopean,\nred, shooting from horizon to horizon, symbol of a vast power, huge and\nterrible; the leviathan with tentacles of steel, to oppose which meant\nto be ground to instant destruction beneath the clashing wheels. No,\nit was better to submit, to resign oneself to the inevitable. She\nobliterated herself, shrinking from the harshness of the world,\nstriving, with vain hands, to draw her husband back with her.\n\nJust before Annixter's arrival, she had been sitting, thoughtful, in her\nlong chair, an open volume of poems turned down upon her lap, her glance\nlosing itself in the immensity of Los Muertos that, from the edge of\nthe lawn close by, unrolled itself, gigantic, toward the far, southern\nhorizon, wrinkled and serrated after the season's ploughing. The earth,\nhitherto grey with dust, was now upturned and brown. As far as the eye\ncould reach, it was empty of all life, bare, mournful, absolutely still;\nand, as she looked, there seemed to her morbid imagination--diseased\nand disturbed with long brooding, sick with the monotony of repeated\nsensation--to be disengaged from all this immensity, a sense of a vast\noppression, formless, disquieting. The terror of sheer bigness grew\nslowly in her mind; loneliness beyond words gradually enveloped her. She\nwas lost in all these limitless reaches of space. Had she been abandoned\nin mid-ocean, in an open boat, her terror could hardly have been\ngreater. She felt vividly that certain uncongeniality which, when all is\nsaid, forever remains between humanity and the earth which supports it.\nShe recognised the colossal indifference of nature, not hostile, even\nkindly and friendly, so long as the human ant-swarm was submissive,\nworking with it, hurrying along at its side in the mysterious march\nof the centuries. Let, however, the insect rebel, strive to make head\nagainst the power of this nature, and at once it became relentless, a\ngigantic engine, a vast power, huge, terrible; a leviathan with a heart\nof steel, knowing no compunction, no forgiveness, no tolerance; crushing\nout the human atom with sound less calm, the agony of destruction\nsending never a jar, never the faintest tremour through all that\nprodigious mechanism of wheels and cogs.\n\nSuch thoughts as these did not take shape distinctly in her mind. She\ncould not have told herself exactly what it was that disquieted her. She\nonly received the vague sensation of these things, as it were a breath\nof wind upon her face, confused, troublous, an indefinite sense of\nhostility in the air.\n\nThe sound of hoofs grinding upon the gravel of the driveway brought her\nto herself again, and, withdrawing her gaze from the empty plain of\nLos Muertos, she saw young Annixter stopping his horse by the carriage\nsteps. But the sight of him only diverted her mind to the other\ntrouble. She could not but regard him with aversion. He was one of the\nconspirators, was one of the leaders in the battle that impended; no\ndoubt, he had come to make a fresh attempt to win over Magnus to the\nunholy alliance.\n\nHowever, there was little trace of enmity in her greeting. Her hair was\nstill spread, like a broad patch of back, and she made that her excuse\nfor not getting up. In answer to Annixter's embarrassed inquiry after\nMagnus, she sent the Chinese cook to call him from the office; and\nAnnixter, after tying his horse to the ring driven into the trunk of one\nof the eucalyptus trees, came up to the porch, and, taking off his hat,\nsat down upon the steps.\n\n“Is Harran anywhere about?” he asked. “I'd like to see Harran, too.”\n\n“No,” said Mrs. Derrick, “Harran went to Bonneville early this morning.”\n\nShe glanced toward Annixter nervously, without turning her head, lest\nshe should disturb her outspread hair.\n\n“What is it you want to see Mr. Derrick about?” she inquired hastily.\n“Is it about this plan to elect a Railroad Commission? Magnus does not\napprove of it,” she declared with energy. “He told me so last night.”\n\nAnnixter moved about awkwardly where he sat, smoothing down with his\nhand the one stiff lock of yellow hair that persistently stood up from\nhis crown like an Indian's scalp-lock. At once his suspicions were all\naroused. Ah! this feemale woman was trying to get a hold on him, trying\nto involve him in a petticoat mess, trying to cajole him. Upon the\ninstant, he became very crafty; an excess of prudence promptly congealed\nhis natural impulses. In an actual spasm of caution, he scarcely trusted\nhimself to speak, terrified lest he should commit himself to something.\nHe glanced about apprehensively, praying that Magnus might join them\nspeedily, relieving the tension.\n\n“I came to see about giving a dance in my new barn,” he answered,\nscowling into the depths of his hat, as though reading from notes he had\nconcealed there. “I wanted to ask how I should send out the invites. I\nthought of just putting an ad. in the 'Mercury.'”\n\nBut as he spoke, Presley had come up behind Annixter in time to get the\ndrift of the conversation, and now observed:\n\n“That's nonsense, Buck. You're not giving a public ball. You MUST send\nout invitations.”\n\n“Hello, Presley, you there?” exclaimed Annixter, turning round. The two\nshook hands.\n\n“Send out invitations?” repeated Annixter uneasily. “Why must I?”\n\n“Because that's the only way to do.”\n\n“It is, is it?” answered Annixter, perplexed and troubled. No other\nman of his acquaintance could have so contradicted Annixter without\nprovoking a quarrel upon the instant. Why the young rancher, irascible,\nobstinate, belligerent, should invariably defer to the poet, was an\ninconsistency never to be explained. It was with great surprise that\nMrs. Derrick heard him continue:\n\n“Well, I suppose you know what you're talking about, Pres. Must have\nwritten invites, hey?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“Typewritten?”\n\n“Why, what an ass you are, Buck,” observed Presley calmly. “Before\nyou get through with it, you will probably insult three-fourths of the\npeople you intend to invite, and have about a hundred quarrels on your\nhands, and a lawsuit or two.”\n\nHowever, before Annixter could reply, Magnus came out on the porch,\nerect, grave, freshly shaven. Without realising what he was doing,\nAnnixter instinctively rose to his feet. It was as though Magnus was a\ncommander-in-chief of an unseen army, and he a subaltern. There was some\nlittle conversation as to the proposed dance, and then Annixter found an\nexcuse for drawing the Governor aside. Mrs. Derrick watched the two with\neyes full of poignant anxiety, as they slowly paced the length of the\ngravel driveway to the road gate, and stood there, leaning upon it,\ntalking earnestly; Magnus tall, thin-lipped, impassive, one hand in the\nbreast of his frock coat, his head bare, his keen, blue eyes fixed upon\nAnnixter's face. Annixter came at once to the main point.\n\n“I got a wire from Osterman this morning, Governor, and, well--we've got\nDisbrow. That means that the Denver, Pueblo and Mojave is back of us.\nThere's half the fight won, first off.”\n\n“Osterman bribed him, I suppose,” observed Magnus.\n\nAnnixter raised a shoulder vexatiously.\n\n“You've got to pay for what you get,” he returned. “You don't get\nsomething for nothing, I guess. Governor,” he went on, “I don't see how\nyou can stay out of this business much longer. You see how it will be.\nWe're going to win, and I don't see how you can feel that it's right of\nyou to let us do all the work and stand all the expense. There's never\nbeen a movement of any importance that went on around you that you\nweren't the leader in it. All Tulare County, all the San Joaquin, for\nthat matter, knows you. They want a leader, and they are looking to you.\nI know how you feel about politics nowadays. But, Governor, standards\nhave changed since your time; everybody plays the game now as we are\nplaying it--the most honourable men. You can't play it any other way,\nand, pshaw! if the right wins out in the end, that's the main thing. We\nwant you in this thing, and we want you bad. You've been chewing on this\naffair now a long time. Have you made up your mind? Do you come in? I\ntell you what, you've got to look at these things in a large way. You've\ngot to judge by results. Well, now, what do you think? Do you come in?”\n\nMagnus's glance left Annixter's face, and for an instant sought the\nground. His frown lowered, but now it was in perplexity, rather than in\nanger. His mind was troubled, harassed with a thousand dissensions.\n\nBut one of Magnus's strongest instincts, one of his keenest desires,\nwas to be, if only for a short time, the master. To control men had\never been his ambition; submission of any kind, his greatest horror. His\nenergy stirred within him, goaded by the lash of his anger, his sense\nof indignity, of insult. Oh for one moment to be able to strike back,\nto crush his enemy, to defeat the railroad, hold the Corporation in the\ngrip of his fist, put down S. Behrman, rehabilitate himself, regain his\nself-respect. To be once more powerful, to command, to dominate. His\nthin lips pressed themselves together; the nostrils of his prominent\nhawk-like nose dilated, his erect, commanding figure stiffened\nunconsciously. For a moment, he saw himself controlling the situation,\nthe foremost figure in his State, feared, respected, thousands of\nmen beneath him, his ambition at length gratified; his career, once\napparently brought to naught, completed; success a palpable achievement.\nWhat if this were his chance, after all, come at last after all these\nyears. His chance! The instincts of the old-time gambler, the most\nredoubtable poker player of El Dorado County, stirred at the word.\nChance! To know it when it came, to recognise it as it passed fleet as a\nwind-flurry, grip at it, catch at it, blind, reckless, staking all upon\nthe hazard of the issue, that was genius. Was this his Chance? All of\na sudden, it seemed to him that it was. But his honour! His cherished,\nlifelong integrity, the unstained purity of his principles? At this late\ndate, were they to be sacrificed? Could he now go counter to all the\nfirm built fabric of his character? How, afterward, could he bear to\nlook Harran and Lyman in the face? And, yet--and, yet--back swung the\npendulum--to neglect his Chance meant failure; a life begun in promise,\nand ended in obscurity, perhaps in financial ruin, poverty even. To\nseize it meant achievement, fame, influence, prestige, possibly great\nwealth.\n\n“I am so sorry to interrupt,” said Mrs. Derrick, as she came up. “I hope\nMr. Annixter will excuse me, but I want Magnus to open the safe for me.\nI have lost the combination, and I must have some money. Phelps is going\ninto town, and I want him to pay some bills for me. Can't you come right\naway, Magnus? Phelps is ready and waiting.”\n\nAnnixter struck his heel into the ground with a suppressed oath.\nAlways these fool feemale women came between him and his plans, mixing\nthemselves up in his affairs. Magnus had been on the very point of\nsaying something, perhaps committing himself to some course of action,\nand, at precisely the wrong moment, his wife had cut in. The opportunity\nwas lost. The three returned toward the ranch house; but before saying\ngood-bye, Annixter had secured from Magnus a promise to the effect that,\nbefore coming to a definite decision in the matter under discussion, he\nwould talk further with him.\n\nPresley met him at the porch. He was going into town with Phelps, and\nproposed to Annixter that he should accompany them.\n\n“I want to go over and see old Broderson,” Annixter objected.\n\nBut Presley informed him that Broderson had gone to Bonneville earlier\nin the morning. He had seen him go past in his buckboard. The three men\nset off, Phelps and Annixter on horseback, Presley on his bicycle.\n\nWhen they had gone, Mrs. Derrick sought out her husband in the office\nof the ranch house. She was at her prettiest that morning, her cheeks\nflushed with excitement, her innocent, wide-open eyes almost girlish.\nShe had fastened her hair, still moist, with a black ribbon tied at the\nback of her head, and the soft mass of light brown reached to below her\nwaist, making her look very young.\n\n“What was it he was saying to you just now,” she exclaimed, as she came\nthrough the gate in the green-painted wire railing of the office. “What\nwas Mr. Annixter saying? I know. He was trying to get you to join him,\ntrying to persuade you to be dishonest, wasn't that it? Tell me, Magnus,\nwasn't that it?”\n\nMagnus nodded.\n\nHis wife drew close to him, putting a hand on his shoulder.\n\n“But you won't, will you? You won't listen to him again; you won't so\nmuch as allow him--anybody--to even suppose you would lend yourself to\nbribery? Oh, Magnus, I don't know what has come over you these last few\nweeks. Why, before this, you would have been insulted if any one thought\nyou would even consider anything like dishonesty. Magnus, it would break\nmy heart if you joined Mr. Annixter and Mr. Osterman. Why, you couldn't\nbe the same man to me afterward; you, who have kept yourself so clean\ntill now. And the boys; what would Lyman say, and Harran, and every one\nwho knows you and respects you, if you lowered yourself to be just a\npolitical adventurer!”\n\nFor a moment, Derrick leaned his head upon his hand, avoiding her gaze.\nAt length, he said, drawing a deep breath: “I am troubled, Annie. These\nare the evil days. I have much upon my mind.”\n\n“Evil days or not,” she insisted, “promise me this one thing, that you\nwill not join Mr. Annixter's scheme.” She had taken his hand in both of\nhers and was looking into his face, her pretty eyes full of pleading.\n\n“Promise me,” she repeated; “give me your word. Whatever happens, let me\nalways be able to be proud of you, as I always have been. Give me your\nword. I know you never seriously thought of joining Mr. Annixter, but I\nam so nervous and frightened sometimes. Just to relieve my mind, Magnus,\ngive me your word.”\n\n“Why--you are right,” he answered. “No, I never thought seriously of it.\nOnly for a moment, I was ambitious to be--I don't know what--what I\nhad hoped to be once--well, that is over now. Annie, your husband is a\ndisappointed man.”\n\n“Give me your word,” she insisted. “We can talk about other things\nafterward.”\n\nAgain Magnus wavered, about to yield to his better instincts and to the\nentreaties of his wife. He began to see how perilously far he had gone\nin this business. He was drifting closer to it every hour. Already he\nwas entangled, already his foot was caught in the mesh that was being\nspun. Sharply he recoiled. Again all his instincts of honesty revolted.\nNo, whatever happened, he would preserve his integrity. His wife was\nright. Always she had influenced his better side. At that moment,\nMagnus's repugnance of the proposed political campaign was at its pitch\nof intensity. He wondered how he had ever allowed himself to so much\nas entertain the idea of joining with the others. Now, he would\nwrench free, would, in a single instant of power, clear himself of all\ncompromising relations. He turned to his wife. Upon his lips trembled\nthe promise she implored. But suddenly there came to his mind the\nrecollection of his new-made pledge to Annixter. He had given his word\nthat before arriving at a decision he would have a last interview with\nhim. To Magnus, his given word was sacred. Though now he wanted to, he\ncould not as yet draw back, could not promise his wife that he would\ndecide to do right. The matter must be delayed a few days longer.\n\nLamely, he explained this to her. Annie Derrick made but little response\nwhen he had done. She kissed his forehead and went out of the room,\nuneasy, depressed, her mind thronging with vague fears, leaving Magnus\nbefore his office desk, his head in his hands, thoughtful, gloomy,\nassaulted by forebodings.\n\nMeanwhile, Annixter, Phelps, and Presley continued on their way toward\nBonneville. In a short time they had turned into the County Road by\nthe great watering-tank, and proceeded onward in the shade of the\ninterminable line of poplar trees, the wind-break that stretched along\nthe roadside bordering the Broderson ranch. But as they drew near to\nCaraher's saloon and grocery, about half a mile outside of Bonneville,\nthey recognised Harran's horse tied to the railing in front of it.\nAnnixter left the others and went in to see Harran.\n\n“Harran,” he said, when the two had sat down on either side of one of\nthe small tables, “you've got to make up your mind one way or another\npretty soon. What are you going to do? Are you going to stand by and see\nthe rest of the Committee spending money by the bucketful in this thing\nand keep your hands in your pockets? If we win, you'll benefit just as\nmuch as the rest of us. I suppose you've got some money of your own--you\nhave, haven't you? You are your father's manager, aren't you?”\n\nDisconcerted at Annixter's directness, Harran stammered an affirmative,\nadding:\n\n“It's hard to know just what to do. It's a mean position for me, Buck. I\nwant to help you others, but I do want to play fair. I don't know how to\nplay any other way. I should like to have a line from the Governor as\nto how to act, but there's no getting a word out of him these days. He\nseems to want to let me decide for myself.”\n\n“Well, look here,” put in Annixter. “Suppose you keep out of the thing\ntill it's all over, and then share and share alike with the Committee on\ncampaign expenses.”\n\nHarran fell thoughtful, his hands in his pockets, frowning moodily at\nthe toe of his boot. There was a silence. Then:\n\n“I don't like to go it blind,” he hazarded. “I'm sort of sharing the\nresponsibility of what you do, then. I'm a silent partner. And, then--I\ndon't want to have any difficulties with the Governor. We've always got\nalong well together. He wouldn't like it, you know, if I did anything\nlike that.” “Say,” exclaimed Annixter abruptly, “if the Governor says\nhe will keep his hands off, and that you can do as you please, will you\ncome in? For God's sake, let us ranchers act together for once. Let's\nstand in with each other in ONE fight.”\n\nWithout knowing it, Annixter had touched the right spring.\n\n“I don't know but what you're right,” Harran murmured vaguely. His\nsense of discouragement, that feeling of what's-the-use, was never more\noppressive. All fair means had been tried. The wheat grower was at last\nwith his back to the wall. If he chose his own means of fighting, the\nresponsibility must rest upon his enemies, not on himself.\n\n“It's the only way to accomplish anything,” he continued, “standing in\nwith each other... well,... go ahead and see what you can do. If the\nGovernor is willing, I'll come in for my share of the campaign fund.”\n\n“That's some sense,” exclaimed Annixter, shaking him by the hand. “Half\nthe fight is over already. We've got Disbrow you know; and the next\nthing is to get hold of some of those rotten San Francisco bosses.\nOsterman will----” But Harran interrupted him, making a quick gesture\nwith his hand.\n\n“Don't tell me about it,” he said. “I don't want to know what you and\nOsterman are going to do. If I did, I shouldn't come in.”\n\nYet, for all this, before they said good-bye Annixter had obtained\nHarran's promise that he would attend the next meeting of the Committee,\nwhen Osterman should return from Los Angeles and make his report. Harran\nwent on toward Los Muertos. Annixter mounted and rode into Bonneville.\n\nBonneville was very lively at all times. It was a little city of some\ntwenty or thirty thousand inhabitants, where, as yet, the city hall, the\nhigh school building, and the opera house were objects of civic\npride. It was well governed, beautifully clean, full of the energy and\nstrenuous young life of a new city. An air of the briskest activity\npervaded its streets and sidewalks. The business portion of the town,\ncentring about Main Street, was always crowded. Annixter, arriving at\nthe Post Office, found himself involved in a scene of swiftly\nshifting sights and sounds. Saddle horses, farm wagons--the inevitable\nStudebakers--buggies grey with the dust of country roads, buckboards\nwith squashes and grocery packages stowed under the seat, two-wheeled\nsulkies and training carts, were hitched to the gnawed railings and\nzinc-sheathed telegraph poles along the curb. Here and there, on the\nedge of the sidewalk, were bicycles, wedged into bicycle racks painted\nwith cigar advertisements. Upon the asphalt sidewalk itself, soft and\nsticky with the morning's heat, was a continuous movement. Men with\nlarge stomachs, wearing linen coats but no vests, laboured ponderously\nup and down. Girls in lawn skirts, shirt waists, and garden hats, went\nto and fro, invariably in couples, coming in and out of the drug store,\nthe grocery store, and haberdasher's, or lingering in front of the Post\nOffice, which was on a corner under the I.O.O.F. hall. Young men, in\nshirt sleeves, with brown, wicker cuff-protectors over their forearms,\nand pencils behind their ears, bustled in front of the grocery store,\nanxious and preoccupied. A very old man, a Mexican, in ragged white\ntrousers and bare feet, sat on a horse-block in front of the barber\nshop, holding a horse by a rope around its neck. A Chinaman went by,\nteetering under the weight of his market baskets slung on a pole across\nhis shoulders. In the neighbourhood of the hotel, the Yosemite House,\ntravelling salesmen, drummers for jewelry firms of San Francisco,\ncommercial agents, insurance men, well-dressed, metropolitan, debonair,\nstood about cracking jokes, or hurried in and out of the flapping white\ndoors of the Yosemite barroom. The Yosemite 'bus and City 'bus passed\nup the street, on the way from the morning train, each with its two or\nthree passengers. A very narrow wagon, belonging to the Cole & Colemore\nHarvester Works, went by, loaded with long strips of iron that made a\nhorrible din as they jarred over the unevenness of the pavement. The\nelectric car line, the city's boast, did a brisk business, its cars\nwhirring from end to end of the street, with a jangling of bells and\na moaning plaint of gearing. On the stone bulkheads of the grass plat\naround the new City Hall, the usual loafers sat, chewing tobacco,\nswapping stories. In the park were the inevitable array of nursemaids,\nskylarking couples, and ragged little boys. A single policeman, in grey\ncoat and helmet, friend and acquaintance of every man and woman in the\ntown, stood by the park entrance, leaning an elbow on the fence post,\ntwirling his club.\n\nBut in the centre of the best business block of the street was a\nthree-story building of rough brown stone, set off with plate glass\nwindows and gold-lettered signs. One of these latter read, “Pacific and\nSouthwestern Railroad, Freight and Passenger Office,” while another much\nsmaller, beneath the windows of the second story bore the inscription,\n“P. and S. W. Land Office.”\n\nAnnixter hitched his horse to the iron post in front of this building,\nand tramped up to the second floor, letting himself into an office\nwhere a couple of clerks and bookkeepers sat at work behind a high wire\nscreen. One of these latter recognised him and came forward.\n\n“Hello,” said Annixter abruptly, scowling the while. “Is your boss in?\nIs Ruggles in?”\n\nThe bookkeeper led Annixter to the private office in an adjoining room,\nushering him through a door, on the frosted glass of which was painted\nthe name, “Cyrus Blakelee Ruggles.” Inside, a man in a frock coat,\nshoestring necktie, and Stetson hat, sat writing at a roller-top desk.\nOver this desk was a vast map of the railroad holdings in the country\nabout Bonneville and Guadalajara, the alternate sections belonging to\nthe Corporation accurately plotted. Ruggles was cordial in his welcome\nof Annixter. He had a way of fiddling with his pencil continually while\nhe talked, scribbling vague lines and fragments of words and names on\nstray bits of paper, and no sooner had Annixter sat down than he had\nbegun to write, in full-bellied script, ANN ANN all over his blotting\npad.\n\n“I want to see about those lands of mine--I mean of yours--of the\nrailroad's,” Annixter commenced at once. “I want to know when I can buy.\nI'm sick of fooling along like this.”\n\n“Well, Mr. Annixter,” observed Ruggles, writing a great L before the\nANN, and finishing it off with a flourishing D. “The lands”--he crossed\nout one of the N's and noted the effect with a hasty glance--“the lands\nare practically yours. You have an option on them indefinitely, and, as\nit is, you don't have to pay the taxes.”\n\n“Rot your option! I want to own them,” Annixter declared. “What have you\npeople got to gain by putting off selling them to us. Here this thing\nhas dragged along for over eight years. When I came in on Quien Sabe,\nthe understanding was that the lands--your alternate sections--were to\nbe conveyed to me within a few months.”\n\n“The land had not been patented to us then,” answered Ruggles.\n\n“Well, it has been now, I guess,” retorted Annixter.\n\n“I'm sure I couldn't tell you, Mr. Annixter.”\n\nAnnixter crossed his legs weariedly.\n\n“Oh, what's the good of lying, Ruggles? You know better than to talk\nthat way to me.”\n\nRuggles's face flushed on the instant, but he checked his answer and\nlaughed instead.\n\n“Oh, if you know so much about it--” he observed.\n\n“Well, when are you going to sell to me?”\n\n“I'm only acting for the General Office, Mr. Annixter,” returned\nRuggles. “Whenever the Directors are ready to take that matter up, I'll\nbe only too glad to put it through for you.”\n\n“As if you didn't know. Look here, you're not talking to old Broderson.\nWake up, Ruggles. What's all this talk in Genslinger's rag about the\ngrading of the value of our lands this winter and an advance in the\nprice?”\n\nRuggles spread out his hands with a deprecatory gesture.\n\n“I don't own the 'Mercury,'” he said.\n\n“Well, your company does.”\n\n“If it does, I don't know anything about it.”\n\n“Oh, rot! As if you and Genslinger and S. Behrman didn't run the whole\nshow down here. Come on, let's have it, Ruggles. What does S. Behrman\npay Genslinger for inserting that three-inch ad. of the P. and S. W. in\nhis paper? Ten thousand a year, hey?”\n\n“Oh, why not a hundred thousand and be done with it?” returned the\nother, willing to take it as a joke.\n\nInstead of replying, Annixter drew his check-book from his inside\npocket.\n\n“Let me take that fountain pen of yours,” he said. Holding the book on\nhis knee he wrote out a check, tore it carefully from the stub, and laid\nit on the desk in front of Ruggles.\n\n“What's this?” asked Ruggles.\n\n“Three-fourths payment for the sections of railroad land included in my\nranch, based on a valuation of two dollars and a half per acre. You can\nhave the balance in sixty-day notes.”\n\nRuggles shook his head, drawing hastily back from the check as though it\ncarried contamination.\n\n“I can't touch it,” he declared. “I've no authority to sell to you yet.”\n\n“I don't understand you people,” exclaimed Annixter. “I offered to buy\nof you the same way four years ago and you sang the same song. Why, it\nisn't business. You lose the interest on your money. Seven per cent. of\nthat capital for four years--you can figure it out. It's big money.”\n\n“Well, then, I don't see why you're so keen on parting with it. You can\nget seven per cent. the same as us.”\n\n“I want to own my own land,” returned Annixter. “I want to feel that\nevery lump of dirt inside my fence is my personal property. Why, the\nvery house I live in now--the ranch house--stands on railroad ground.”\n\n“But, you've an option”\n\n“I tell you I don't want your cursed option. I want ownership; and it's\nthe same with Magnus Derrick and old Broderson and Osterman and all the\nranchers of the county. We want to own our land, want to feel we can do\nas we blame please with it. Suppose I should want to sell Quien Sabe. I\ncan't sell it as a whole till I've bought of you. I can't give anybody a\nclear title. The land has doubled in value ten times over again since I\ncame in on it and improved it. It's worth easily twenty an acre now. But\nI can't take advantage of that rise in value so long as you won't sell,\nso long as I don't own it. You're blocking me.”\n\n“But, according to you, the railroad can't take advantage of the rise in\nany case. According to you, you can sell for twenty dollars, but we can\nonly get two and a half.”\n\n“Who made it worth twenty?” cried Annixter. “I've improved it up to\nthat figure. Genslinger seems to have that idea in his nut, too. Do you\npeople think you can hold that land, untaxed, for speculative purposes\nuntil it goes up to thirty dollars and then sell out to some one\nelse--sell it over our heads? You and Genslinger weren't in office when\nthose contracts were drawn. You ask your boss, you ask S. Behrman, he\nknows. The General Office is pledged to sell to us in preference to any\none else, for two and a half.”\n\n“Well,” observed Ruggles decidedly, tapping the end of his pencil on his\ndesk and leaning forward to emphasise his words, “we're not selling NOW.\nThat's said and signed, Mr. Annixter.”\n\n“Why not? Come, spit it out. What's the bunco game this time?”\n\n“Because we're not ready. Here's your check.”\n\n“You won't take it?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I'll make it a cash payment, money down--the whole of it--payable to\nCyrus Blakelee Ruggles, for the P. and S. W.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Third and last time.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Oh, go to the devil!”\n\n“I don't like your tone, Mr. Annixter,” returned Ruggles, flushing\nangrily. “I don't give a curse whether you like it or not,” retorted\nAnnixter, rising and thrusting the check into his pocket, “but never you\nmind, Mr. Ruggles, you and S. Behrman and Genslinger and Shelgrim and\nthe whole gang of thieves of you--you'll wake this State of California\nup some of these days by going just one little bit too far, and there'll\nbe an election of Railroad Commissioners of, by, and for the people,\nthat'll get a twist of you, my bunco-steering friend--you and your\nbackers and cappers and swindlers and thimble-riggers, and smash you,\nlock, stock, and barrel. That's my tip to you and be damned to you, Mr.\nCyrus Blackleg Ruggles.”\n\nAnnixter stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him, and\nRuggles, trembling with anger, turned to his desk and to the blotting\npad written all over with the words LANDS, TWENTY DOLLARS, TWO AND A\nHALF, OPTION, and, over and over again, with great swelling curves and\nflourishes, RAILROAD, RAILROAD, RAILROAD.\n\nBut as Annixter passed into the outside office, on the other side of\nthe wire partition he noted the figure of a man at the counter in\nconversation with one of the clerks. There was something familiar to\nAnnixter's eye about the man's heavy built frame, his great shoulders\nand massive back, and as he spoke to the clerk in a tremendous, rumbling\nvoice, Annixter promptly recognised Dyke.\n\nThere was a meeting. Annixter liked Dyke, as did every one else in\nand about Bonneville. He paused now to shake hands with the discharged\nengineer and to ask about his little daughter, Sidney, to whom he knew\nDyke was devotedly attached.\n\n“Smartest little tad in Tulare County,” asserted Dyke. “She's getting\nprettier every day, Mr. Annixter. THERE'S a little tad that was just\nborn to be a lady. Can recite the whole of 'Snow Bound' without ever\nstopping. You don't believe that, maybe, hey? Well, it's true. She'll be\njust old enough to enter the Seminary up at Marysville next winter, and\nif my hop business pays two per cent. on the investment, there's where\nshe's going to go.”\n\n“How's it coming on?” inquired Annixter.\n\n“The hop ranch? Prime. I've about got the land in shape, and I've\nengaged a foreman who knows all about hops. I've been in luck. Everybody\nwill go into the business next year when they see hops go to a dollar,\nand they'll overstock the market and bust the price. But I'm going to\nget the cream of it now. I say two per cent. Why, Lord love you, it\nwill pay a good deal more than that. It's got to. It's cost more than\nI figured to start the thing, so, perhaps, I may have to borrow\nsomewheres; but then on such a sure game as this--and I do want to make\nsomething out of that little tad of mine.”\n\n“Through here?” inquired Annixter, making ready to move off.\n\n“In just a minute,” answered Dyke. “Wait for me and I'll walk down the\nstreet with you.”\n\nAnnixter grumbled that he was in a hurry, but waited, nevertheless,\nwhile Dyke again approached the clerk.\n\n“I shall want some empty cars of you people this fall,” he explained.\n“I'm a hop-raiser now, and I just want to make sure what your rates on\nhops are. I've been told, but I want to make sure. Savvy?” There was a\nlong delay while the clerk consulted the tariff schedules, and Annixter\nfretted impatiently. Dyke, growing uneasy, leaned heavily on his elbows,\nwatching the clerk anxiously. If the tariff was exorbitant, he saw his\nplans brought to naught, his money jeopardised, the little tad, Sidney,\ndeprived of her education. He began to blame himself that he had not\nlong before determined definitely what the railroad would charge for\nmoving his hops. He told himself he was not much of a business man; that\nhe managed carelessly.\n\n“Two cents,” suddenly announced the clerk with a certain surly\nindifference.\n\n“Two cents a pound?”\n\n“Yes, two cents a pound--that's in car-load lots, of course. I won't\ngive you that rate on smaller consignments.”\n\n“Yes, car-load lots, of course... two cents. Well, all right.”\n\nHe turned away with a great sigh of relief.\n\n“He sure did have me scared for a minute,” he said to Annixter, as the\ntwo went down to the street, “fiddling and fussing so long. Two cents\nis all right, though. Seems fair to me. That fiddling of his was all\nput on. I know 'em, these railroad heelers. He knew I was a discharged\nemployee first off, and he played the game just to make me seem small\nbecause I had to ask favours of him. I don't suppose the General Office\ntips its slavees off to act like swine, but there's the feeling through\nthe whole herd of them. 'Ye got to come to us. We let ye live only so\nlong as we choose, and what are ye going to do about it? If ye don't\nlike it, git out.'”\n\nAnnixter and the engineer descended to the street and had a drink at the\nYosemite bar, and Annixter went into the General Store while Dyke\nbought a little pair of red slippers for Sidney. Before the salesman had\nwrapped them up, Dyke slipped a dime into the toe of each with a wink at\nAnnixter.\n\n“Let the little tad find 'em there,” he said behind his hand in a hoarse\nwhisper. “That'll be one on Sid.”\n\n“Where to now?” demanded Annixter as they regained the street. “I'm\ngoing down to the Post Office and then pull out for the ranch. Going my\nway?”\n\nDyke hesitated in some confusion, tugging at the ends of his fine blonde\nbeard.\n\n“No, no. I guess I'll leave you here. I've got--got other things to do\nup the street. So long.”\n\nThe two separated, and Annixter hurried through the crowd to the Post\nOffice, but the mail that had come in on that morning's train was\nunusually heavy. It was nearly half an hour before it was distributed.\nNaturally enough, Annixter placed all the blame of the delay upon the\nrailroad, and delivered himself of some pointed remarks in the midst of\nthe waiting crowd. He was irritated to the last degree when he finally\nemerged upon the sidewalk again, cramming his mail into his pockets. One\ncause of his bad temper was the fact that in the bundle of Quien Sabe\nletters was one to Hilma Tree in a man's handwriting.\n\n“Huh!” Annixter had growled to himself, “that pip Delaney. Seems now\nthat I'm to act as go-between for 'em. Well, maybe that feemale girl\ngets this letter, and then, again, maybe she don't.”\n\nBut suddenly his attention was diverted. Directly opposite the Post\nOffice, upon the corner of the street, stood quite the best business\nbuilding of which Bonneville could boast. It was built of Colusa\ngranite, very solid, ornate, imposing. Upon the heavy plate of the\nwindow of its main floor, in gold and red letters, one read the words:\n“Loan and Savings Bank of Tulare County.” It was of this bank that S.\nBehrman was president. At the street entrance of the building was a\ncurved sign of polished brass, fixed upon the angle of the masonry; this\nsign bore the name, “S. Behrman,” and under it in smaller letters were\nthe words, “Real Estate, Mortgages.”\n\nAs Annixter's glance fell upon this building, he was surprised to see\nDyke standing upon the curb in front of it, apparently reading from a\nnewspaper that he held in his hand. But Annixter promptly discovered\nthat he was not reading at all. From time to time the former engineer\nshot a swift glance out of the corner of his eye up and down the street.\nAnnixter jumped at a conclusion. An idea suddenly occurred to him. Dyke\nwas watching to see if he was observed--was waiting an opportunity when\nno one who knew him should be in sight. Annixter stepped back a little,\ngetting a telegraph pole somewhat between him and the other. Very\ninterested, he watched what was going on. Pretty soon Dyke thrust\nthe paper into his pocket and sauntered slowly to the windows of a\nstationery store, next the street entrance of S. Behrman's offices. For\na few seconds he stood there, his back turned, seemingly absorbed in\nthe display, but eyeing the street narrowly nevertheless; then he turned\naround, gave a last look about and stepped swiftly into the doorway\nby the great brass sign. He disappeared. Annixter came from behind the\ntelegraph pole with a flush of actual shame upon his face. There had\nbeen something so slinking, so mean, in the movements and manner of this\ngreat, burly honest fellow of an engineer, that he could not help but\nfeel ashamed for him. Circumstances were such that a simple business\ntransaction was to Dyke almost culpable, a degradation, a thing to be\nconcealed.\n\n“Borrowing money of S. Behrman,” commented Annixter, “mortgaging your\nlittle homestead to the railroad, putting your neck in the halter. Poor\nfool! The pity of it. Good Lord, your hops must pay you big, now, old\nman.”\n\nAnnixter lunched at the Yosemite Hotel, and then later on, toward the\nmiddle of the afternoon, rode out of the town at a canter by the way\nof the Upper Road that paralleled the railroad tracks and that ran\ndiametrically straight between Bonneville and Guadalajara. About\nhalf-way between the two places he overtook Father Sarria trudging back\nto San Juan, his long cassock powdered with dust. He had a wicker crate\nin one hand, and in the other, in a small square valise, the materials\nfor the Holy Sacrament. Since early morning the priest had covered\nnearly fifteen miles on foot, in order to administer Extreme Unction to\na moribund good-for-nothing, a greaser, half Indian, half Portuguese,\nwho lived in a remote corner of Osterman's stock range, at the head of\na canon there. But he had returned by way of Bonneville to get a crate\nthat had come for him from San Diego. He had been notified of its\narrival the day before.\n\nAnnixter pulled up and passed the time of day with the priest.\n\n“I don't often get up your way,” he said, slowing down his horse to\naccommodate Sarria's deliberate plodding. Sarria wiped the perspiration\nfrom his smooth, shiny face.\n\n“You? Well, with you it is different,” he answered. “But there are a\ngreat many Catholics in the county--some on your ranch. And so few come\nto the Mission. At High Mass on Sundays, there are a few--Mexicans and\nSpaniards from Guadalajara mostly; but weekdays, for matins, vespers,\nand the like, I often say the offices to an empty church--'the voice\nof one crying in the wilderness.' You Americans are not good churchmen.\nSundays you sleep--you read the newspapers.”\n\n“Well, there's Vanamee,” observed Annixter. “I suppose he's there early\nand late.”\n\nSarria made a sharp movement of interest.\n\n“Ah, Vanamee--a strange lad; a wonderful character, for all that. If\nthere were only more like him. I am troubled about him. You know I am a\nvery owl at night. I come and go about the Mission at all hours. Within\nthe week, three times I have seen Vanamee in the little garden by the\nMission, and at the dead of night. He had come without asking for me. He\ndid not see me. It was strange. Once, when I had got up at dawn to ring\nfor early matins, I saw him stealing away out of the garden. He must\nhave been there all the night. He is acting queerly. He is pale; his\ncheeks are more sunken than ever. There is something wrong with him. I\ncan't make it out. It is a mystery. Suppose you ask him?”\n\n“Not I. I've enough to bother myself about. Vanamee is crazy in the\nhead. Some morning he will turn up missing again, and drop out of sight\nfor another three years. Best let him alone, Sarria. He's a crank. How\nis that greaser of yours up on Osterman's stock range?”\n\n“Ah, the poor fellow--the poor fellow,” returned the other, the tears\ncoming to his eyes. “He died this morning--as you might say, in my arms,\npainfully, but in the faith, in the faith. A good fellow.”\n\n“A lazy, cattle-stealing, knife-in-his-boot Dago.”\n\n“You misjudge him. A really good fellow on better acquaintance.”\n\nAnnixter grunted scornfully. Sarria's kindness and good-will toward the\nmost outrageous reprobates of the ranches was proverbial. He practically\nsupported some half-dozen families that lived in forgotten cabins, lost\nand all but inaccessible, in the far corners of stock range and\ncanyon. This particular greaser was the laziest, the dirtiest, the most\nworthless of the lot. But in Sarria's mind, the lout was an object of\naffection, sincere, unquestioning. Thrice a week the priest, with a\nbasket of provisions--cold ham, a bottle of wine, olives, loaves of\nbread, even a chicken or two--toiled over the interminable stretch of\ncountry between the Mission and his cabin. Of late, during the rascal's\nsickness, these visits had been almost daily. Hardly once did the priest\nleave the bedside that he did not slip a half-dollar into the palm of\nhis wife or oldest daughter. And this was but one case out of many.\n\nHis kindliness toward animals was the same. A horde of mange-corroded\ncurs lived off his bounty, wolfish, ungrateful, often marking him with\ntheir teeth, yet never knowing the meaning of a harsh word. A burro,\nover-fed, lazy, incorrigible, browsed on the hill back of the Mission,\nobstinately refusing to be harnessed to Sarria's little cart, squealing\nand biting whenever the attempt was made; and the priest suffered him,\nsubmitting to his humour, inventing excuses for him, alleging that the\nburro was foundered, or was in need of shoes, or was feeble from extreme\nage. The two peacocks, magnificent, proud, cold-hearted, resenting all\nfamiliarity, he served with the timorous, apologetic affection of a\nqueen's lady-in-waiting, resigned to their disdain, happy if only they\ncondescended to enjoy the grain he spread for them.\n\nAt the Long Trestle, Annixter and the priest left the road and took the\ntrail that crossed Broderson Creek by the clumps of grey-green willows\nand led across Quien Sabe to the ranch house, and to the Mission farther\non. They were obliged to proceed in single file here, and Annixter,\nwho had allowed the priest to go in front, promptly took notice of the\nwicker basket he carried. Upon his inquiry, Sarria became confused. “It\nwas a basket that he had had sent down to him from the city.”\n\n“Well, I know--but what's in it?”\n\n“Why--I'm sure--ah, poultry--a chicken or two.”\n\n“Fancy breed?”\n\n“Yes, yes, that's it, a fancy breed.” At the ranch house, where they\narrived toward five o'clock, Annixter insisted that the priest should\nstop long enough for a glass of sherry. Sarria left the basket and his\nsmall black valise at the foot of the porch steps, and sat down in a\nrocker on the porch itself, fanning himself with his broad-brimmed hat,\nand shaking the dust from his cassock. Annixter brought out the decanter\nof sherry and glasses, and the two drank to each other's health.\n\nBut as the priest set down his glass, wiping his lips with a murmur of\nsatisfaction, the decrepit Irish setter that had attached himself\nto Annixter's house came out from underneath the porch, and nosed\nvigorously about the wicker basket. He upset it. The little peg holding\ndown the cover slipped, the basket fell sideways, opening as it fell,\nand a cock, his head enclosed in a little chamois bag such as are used\nfor gold watches, struggled blindly out into the open air. A second,\nsimilarly hooded, followed. The pair, stupefied in their headgear, stood\nrigid and bewildered in their tracks, clucking uneasily. Their tails\nwere closely sheared. Their legs, thickly muscled, and extraordinarily\nlong, were furnished with enormous cruel-looking spurs. The breed\nwas unmistakable. Annixter looked once at the pair, then shouted with\nlaughter.\n\n“'Poultry'--'a chicken or two'--'fancy breed'--ho! yes, I should think\nso. Game cocks! Fighting cocks! Oh, you old rat! You'll be a dry nurse\nto a burro, and keep a hospital for infirm puppies, but you will fight\ngame cocks. Oh, Lord! Why, Sarria, this is as good a grind as I ever\nheard. There's the Spanish cropping out, after all.”\n\nSpeechless with chagrin, the priest bundled the cocks into the basket\nand catching up the valise, took himself abruptly away, almost running\ntill he had put himself out of hearing of Annixter's raillery. And even\nten minutes later, when Annixter, still chuckling, stood upon the porch\nsteps, he saw the priest, far in the distance, climbing the slope of\nthe high ground, in the direction of the Mission, still hurrying on at\na great pace, his cassock flapping behind him, his head bent; to\nAnnixter's notion the very picture of discomfiture and confusion.\n\nAs Annixter turned about to reenter the house, he found himself almost\nface to face with Hilma Tree. She was just going in at the doorway, and\na great flame of the sunset, shooting in under the eaves of the porch,\nenveloped her from her head, with its thick, moist hair that hung low\nover her neck, to her slim feet, setting a golden flash in the little\nsteel buckles of her low shoes. She had come to set the table for\nAnnixter's supper. Taken all aback by the suddenness of the encounter,\nAnnixter ejaculated an abrupt and senseless, “Excuse me.” But Hilma,\nwithout raising her eyes, passed on unmoved into the dining-room,\nleaving Annixter trying to find his breath, and fumbling with the brim\nof his hat, that he was surprised to find he had taken from his head.\nResolutely, and taking a quick advantage of his opportunity, he followed\nher into the dining-room.\n\n“I see that dog has turned up,” he announced with brisk cheerfulness.\n“That Irish setter I was asking about.”\n\nHilma, a swift, pink flush deepening the delicate rose of her cheeks,\ndid not reply, except by nodding her head. She flung the table-cloth out\nfrom under her arms across the table, spreading it smooth, with quick\nlittle caresses of her hands. There was a moment's silence. Then\nAnnixter said:\n\n“Here's a letter for you.” He laid it down on the table near her, and\nHilma picked it up. “And see here, Miss Hilma,” Annixter continued,\n“about that--this morning--I suppose you think I am a first-class\nmucker. If it will do any good to apologise, why, I will. I want to be\nfriends with you. I made a bad mistake, and started in the wrong way.\nI don't know much about women people. I want you to forget about\nthat--this morning, and not think I am a galoot and a mucker. Will you\ndo it? Will you be friends with me?”\n\nHilma set the plate and coffee cup by Annixter's place before answering,\nand Annixter repeated his question. Then she drew a deep, quick breath,\nthe flush in her cheeks returning.\n\n“I think it was--it was so wrong of you,” she murmured. “Oh! you don't\nknow how it hurt me. I cried--oh, for an hour.”\n\n“Well, that's just it,” returned Annixter vaguely, moving his head\nuneasily. “I didn't know what kind of a girl you were--I mean, I made\na mistake. I thought it didn't make much difference. I thought all\nfeemales were about alike.”\n\n“I hope you know now,” murmured Hilma ruefully. “I've paid enough to\nhave you find out. I cried--you don't know. Why, it hurt me worse than\nanything I can remember. I hope you know now.” “Well, I do know now,” he\nexclaimed.\n\n“It wasn't so much that you tried to do--what you did,” answered Hilma,\nthe single deep swell from her waist to her throat rising and falling in\nher emotion. “It was that you thought that you could--that anybody could\nthat wanted to--that I held myself so cheap. Oh!” she cried, with a\nsudden sobbing catch in her throat, “I never can forget it, and you\ndon't know what it means to a girl.”\n\n“Well, that's just what I do want,” he repeated. “I want you to forget\nit and have us be good friends.”\n\nIn his embarrassment, Annixter could think of no other words. He kept\nreiterating again and again during the pauses of the conversation:\n\n“I want you to forget it. Will you? Will you forget it--that--this\nmorning, and have us be good friends?”\n\nHe could see that her trouble was keen. He was astonished that the\nmatter should be so grave in her estimation. After all, what was it that\na girl should be kissed? But he wanted to regain his lost ground.\n\n“Will you forget it, Miss Hilma? I want you to like me.”\n\nShe took a clean napkin from the sideboard drawer and laid it down by\nthe plate.\n\n“I--I do want you to like me,” persisted Annixter. “I want you to forget\nall about this business and like me.”\n\nHilma was silent. Annixter saw the tears in her eyes.\n\n“How about that? Will you forget it? Will you--will--will you LIKE me?”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“No,” she said.\n\n“No what? You won't like me? Is that it?”\n\nHilma, blinking at the napkin through her tears, nodded to say, Yes,\nthat was it. Annixter hesitated a moment, frowning, harassed and\nperplexed.\n\n“You don't like me at all, hey?”\n\nAt length Hilma found her speech. In her low voice, lower and more\nvelvety than ever, she said:\n\n“No--I don't like you at all.”\n\nThen, as the tears suddenly overpowered her, she dashed a hand across\nher eyes, and ran from the room and out of doors.\n\nAnnixter stood for a moment thoughtful, his protruding lower lip thrust\nout, his hands in his pocket.\n\n“I suppose she'll quit now,” he muttered. “Suppose she'll leave the\nranch--if she hates me like that. Well, she can go--that's all--she can\ngo. Fool feemale girl,” he muttered between his teeth, “petticoat mess.”\n He was about to sit down to his supper when his eye fell upon the\nIrish setter, on his haunches in the doorway. There was an expectant,\ningratiating look on the dog's face. No doubt, he suspected it was time\nfor eating.\n\n“Get out--YOU!” roared Annixter in a tempest of wrath.\n\nThe dog slunk back, his tail shut down close, his ears drooping, but\ninstead of running away, he lay down and rolled supinely upon his back,\nthe very image of submission, tame, abject, disgusting. It was the one\nthing to drive Annixter to a fury. He kicked the dog off the porch in\na rolling explosion of oaths, and flung himself down to his seat before\nthe table, fuming and panting.\n\n“Damn the dog and the girl and the whole rotten business--and now,” he\nexclaimed, as a sudden fancied qualm arose in his stomach, “now, it's\nall made me sick. Might have known it. Oh, it only lacked that to wind\nup the whole day. Let her go, I don't care, and the sooner the better.”\n\nHe countermanded the supper and went to bed before it was dark, lighting\nhis lamp, on the chair near the head of the bed, and opening his\n“Copperfield” at the place marked by the strip of paper torn from the\nbag of prunes. For upward of an hour he read the novel, methodically\nswallowing one prune every time he reached the bottom of a page. About\nnine o'clock he blew out the lamp and, punching up his pillow, settled\nhimself for the night.\n\nThen, as his mind relaxed in that strange, hypnotic condition that\ncomes just before sleep, a series of pictures of the day's doings passed\nbefore his imagination like the roll of a kinetoscope.\n\nFirst, it was Hilma Tree, as he had seen her in the\ndairy-house--charming, delicious, radiant of youth, her thick, white\nneck with its pale amber shadows under the chin; her wide, open eyes\nrimmed with fine, black lashes; the deep swell of her breast and hips,\nthe delicate, lustrous floss on her cheek, impalpable as the pollen of\na flower. He saw her standing there in the scintillating light of the\nmorning, her smooth arms wet with milk, redolent and fragrant of milk,\nher whole, desirable figure moving in the golden glory of the sun,\nsteeped in a lambent flame, saturated with it, glowing with it, joyous\nas the dawn itself.\n\nThen it was Los Muertos and Hooven, the sordid little Dutchman, grimed\nwith the soil he worked in, yet vividly remembering a period of military\nglory, exciting himself with recollections of Gravelotte and the\nKaiser, but contented now in the country of his adoption, defining the\nFatherland as the place where wife and children lived. Then came the\nranch house of Los Muertos, under the grove of cypress and eucalyptus,\nwith its smooth, gravelled driveway and well-groomed lawns; Mrs. Derrick\nwith her wide-opened eyes, that so easily took on a look of uneasiness,\nof innocence, of anxious inquiry, her face still pretty, her brown hair\nthat still retained so much of its brightness spread over her chair\nback, drying in the sun; Magnus, erect as an officer of cavalry,\nsmooth-shaven, grey, thin-lipped, imposing, with his hawk-like nose and\nforward-curling grey hair; Presley with his dark face, delicate mouth\nand sensitive, loose lips, in corduroys and laced boots, smoking\ncigarettes--an interesting figure, suggestive of a mixed origin, morbid,\nexcitable, melancholy, brooding upon things that had no names. Then\nit was Bonneville, with the gayety and confusion of Main Street,\nthe whirring electric cars, the zinc-sheathed telegraph poles, the\nbuckboards with squashes stowed under the seats; Ruggles in frock coat,\nStetson hat and shoe-string necktie, writing abstractedly upon his\nblotting pad; Dyke, the engineer, big-boned. Powerful, deep-voiced,\ngood-natured, with his fine blonde beard and massive arms, rehearsing\nthe praises of his little daughter Sidney, guided only by the one\nambition that she should be educated at a seminary, slipping a dime into\nthe toe of her diminutive slipper, then, later, overwhelmed with shame,\nslinking into S. Behrman's office to mortgage his homestead to the\nheeler of the corporation that had discharged him. By suggestion,\nAnnixter saw S. Behrman, too, fat, with a vast stomach, the check and\nneck meeting to form a great, tremulous jowl, the roll of fat over his\ncollar, sprinkled with sparse, stiff hairs; saw his brown, round-topped\nhat of varnished straw, the linen vest stamped with innumerable\ninterlocked horseshoes, the heavy watch chain, clinking against the\npearl vest buttons; invariably placid, unruffled, never losing his\ntemper, serene, unassailable, enthroned.\n\nThen, at the end of all, it was the ranch again, seen in a last brief\nglance before he had gone to bed; the fecundated earth, calm at last,\nnursing the emplanted germ of life, ruddy with the sunset, the horizons\npurple, the small clamour of the day lapsing into quiet, the great,\nstill twilight, building itself, dome-like, toward the zenith. The barn\nfowls were roosting in the trees near the stable, the horses crunching\ntheir fodder in the stalls, the day's work ceasing by slow degrees; and\nthe priest, the Spanish churchman, Father Sarria, relic of a departed\nregime, kindly, benign, believing in all goodness, a lover of his\nfellows and of dumb animals, yet, for all that, hurrying away in\nconfusion and discomfiture, carrying in one hand the vessels of the Holy\nCommunion and in the other a basket of game cocks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nIt was high noon, and the rays of the sun, that hung poised directly\noverhead in an intolerable white glory, fell straight as plummets upon\nthe roofs and streets of Guadalajara. The adobe walls and sparse brick\nsidewalks of the drowsing town radiated the heat in an oily, quivering\nshimmer. The leaves of the eucalyptus trees around the Plaza drooped\nmotionless, limp and relaxed under the scorching, searching blaze.\nThe shadows of these trees had shrunk to their smallest circumference,\ncontracting close about the trunks. The shade had dwindled to the\nbreadth of a mere line. The sun was everywhere. The heat exhaling\nfrom brick and plaster and metal met the heat that steadily descended\nblanketwise and smothering, from the pale, scorched sky. Only the\nlizards--they lived in chinks of the crumbling adobe and in interstices\nof the sidewalk--remained without, motionless, as if stuffed, their eyes\nclosed to mere slits, basking, stupefied with heat. At long intervals\nthe prolonged drone of an insect developed out of the silence, vibrated\na moment in a soothing, somnolent, long note, then trailed slowly into\nthe quiet again. Somewhere in the interior of one of the 'dobe houses a\nguitar snored and hummed sleepily. On the roof of the hotel a group of\npigeons cooed incessantly with subdued, liquid murmurs, very plaintive;\na cat, perfectly white, with a pink nose and thin, pink lips, dozed\ncomplacently on a fence rail, full in the sun. In a corner of the Plaza\nthree hens wallowed in the baking hot dust their wings fluttering,\nclucking comfortably.\n\nAnd this was all. A Sunday repose prevailed the whole moribund town,\npeaceful, profound. A certain pleasing numbness, a sense of grateful\nenervation exhaled from the scorching plaster. There was no movement, no\nsound of human business. The faint hum of the insect, the intermittent\nmurmur of the guitar, the mellow complainings of the pigeons, the\nprolonged purr of the white cat, the contented clucking of the\nhens--all these noises mingled together to form a faint, drowsy bourdon,\nprolonged, stupefying, suggestive of an infinite quiet, of a calm,\ncomplacent life, centuries old, lapsing gradually to its end under the\ngorgeous loneliness of a cloudless, pale blue sky and the steady fire of\nan interminable sun.\n\nIn Solotari's Spanish-Mexican restaurant, Vanamee and Presley sat\nopposite each other at one of the tables near the door, a bottle of\nwhite wine, tortillas, and an earthen pot of frijoles between them. They\nwere the sole occupants of the place. It was the day that Annixter had\nchosen for his barn-dance and, in consequence, Quien Sabe was in fete\nand work suspended. Presley and Vanamee had arranged to spend the day in\neach other's company, lunching at Solotari's and taking a long tramp in\nthe afternoon. For the moment they sat back in their chairs, their meal\nall but finished. Solotari brought black coffee and a small carafe of\nmescal, and retiring to a corner of the room, went to sleep.\n\nAll through the meal Presley had been wondering over a certain change he\nobserved in his friend. He looked at him again.\n\nVanamee's lean, spare face was of an olive pallor. His long, black hair,\nsuch as one sees in the saints and evangelists of the pre-Raphaelite\nartists, hung over his ears. Presley again remarked his pointed beard,\nblack and fine, growing from the hollow cheeks. He looked at his face,\na face like that of a young seer, like a half-inspired shepherd of\nthe Hebraic legends, a dweller in the wilderness, gifted with strange\npowers. He was dressed as when Presley had first met him, herding his\nsheep, in brown canvas overalls, thrust into top boots; grey flannel\nshirt, open at the throat, showing the breast ruddy with tan; the waist\nencircled with a cartridge belt, empty of cartridges.\n\nBut now, as Presley took more careful note of him, he was surprised to\nobserve a certain new look in Vanamee's deep-set eyes. He remembered now\nthat all through the morning Vanamee had been singularly reserved.\nHe was continually drifting into reveries, abstracted, distrait.\nIndubitably, something of moment had happened.\n\nAt length Vanamee spoke. Leaning back in his chair, his thumbs in his\nbelt, his bearded chin upon his breast, his voice was the even monotone\nof one speaking in his sleep.\n\nHe told Presley in a few words what had happened during the first\nnight he had spent in the garden of the old Mission, of the Answer,\nhalf-fancied, half-real, that had come to him.\n\n“To no other person but you would I speak of this,” he said, “but you,\nI think, will understand--will be sympathetic, at least, and I feel the\nneed of unburdening myself of it to some one. At first I would not trust\nmy own senses. I was sure I had deceived myself, but on a second\nnight it happened again. Then I was afraid--or no, not afraid, but\ndisturbed--oh, shaken to my very heart's core. I resolved to go no\nfurther in the matter, never again to put it to test. For a long time I\nstayed away from the Mission, occupying myself with my work, keeping\nit out of my mind. But the temptation was too strong. One night I found\nmyself there again, under the black shadow of the pear trees calling for\nAngele, summoning her from out the dark, from out the night. This time\nthe Answer was prompt, unmistakable. I cannot explain to you what it\nwas, nor how it came to me, for there was no sound. I saw absolutely\nnothing but the empty night. There was no moon. But somewhere off there\nover the little valley, far off, the darkness was troubled; that ME\nthat went out upon my thought--out from the Mission garden, out over the\nvalley, calling for her, searching for her, found, I don't know what,\nbut found a resting place--a companion. Three times since then I have\ngone to the Mission garden at night. Last night was the third time.”\n\nHe paused, his eyes shining with excitement. Presley leaned forward\ntoward him, motionless with intense absorption.\n\n“Well--and last night,” he prompted.\n\nVanamee stirred in his seat, his glance fell, he drummed an instant upon\nthe table.\n\n“Last night,” he answered, “there was--there was a change. The Answer\nwas--” he drew a deep breath--“nearer.”\n\n“You are sure?”\n\nThe other smiled with absolute certainty.\n\n“It was not that I found the Answer sooner, easier. I could not be\nmistaken. No, that which has troubled the darkness, that which has\nentered into the empty night--is coming nearer to me--physically nearer,\nactually nearer.”\n\nHis voice sank again. His face like the face of younger prophets, the\nseers, took on a half-inspired expression. He looked vaguely before him\nwith unseeing eyes.\n\n“Suppose,” he murmured, “suppose I stand there under the pear trees\nat night and call her again and again, and each time the Answer comes\nnearer and nearer and I wait until at last one night, the supreme night\nof all, she--she----”\n\nSuddenly the tension broke. With a sharp cry and a violent uncertain\ngesture of the hand Vanamee came to himself.\n\n“Oh,” he exclaimed, “what is it? Do I dare? What does it mean? There are\ntimes when it appals me and there are times when it thrills me with\na sweetness and a happiness that I have not known since she died. The\nvagueness of it! How can I explain it to you, this that happens when I\ncall to her across the night--that faint, far-off, unseen tremble in the\ndarkness, that intangible, scarcely perceptible stir. Something neither\nheard nor seen, appealing to a sixth sense only. Listen, it is something\nlike this: On Quien Sabe, all last week, we have been seeding the earth.\nThe grain is there now under the earth buried in the dark, in the black\nstillness, under the clods. Can you imagine the first--the very first\nlittle quiver of life that the grain of wheat must feel after it is\nsown, when it answers to the call of the sun, down there in the dark of\nthe earth, blind, deaf; the very first stir from the inert, long, long\nbefore any physical change has occurred,--long before the microscope\ncould discover the slightest change,--when the shell first tightens with\nthe first faint premonition of life? Well, it is something as illusive\nas that.” He paused again, dreaming, lost in a reverie, then, just above\na whisper, murmured:\n\n“'That which thou sowest is not quickened except it die,'... and she,\nAngele... died.”\n\n“You could not have been mistaken?” said Presley. “You were sure that\nthere was something? Imagination can do so much and the influence of the\nsurroundings was strong. How impossible it would be that anything SHOULD\nhappen. And you say you heard nothing, saw nothing.”\n\n“I believe,” answered Vanamee, “in a sixth sense, or, rather, a whole\nsystem of other unnamed senses beyond the reach of our understanding.\nPeople who live much alone and close to nature experience the sensation\nof it. Perhaps it is something fundamental that we share with plants and\nanimals. The same thing that sends the birds south long before the first\ncolds, the same thing that makes the grain of wheat struggle up to meet\nthe sun. And this sense never deceives. You may see wrong, hear wrong,\nbut once touch this sixth sense and it acts with absolute fidelity, you\nare certain. No, I hear nothing in the Mission garden. I see nothing,\nnothing touches me, but I am CERTAIN for all that.”\n\nPresley hesitated for a moment, then he asked:\n\n“Shall you go back to the garden again? Make the test again?” “I don't\nknow.”\n\n“Strange enough,” commented Presley, wondering.\n\nVanamee sank back in his chair, his eyes growing vacant again:\n\n“Strange enough,” he murmured.\n\nThere was a long silence. Neither spoke nor moved. There, in that\nmoribund, ancient town, wrapped in its siesta, flagellated with heat,\ndeserted, ignored, baking in a noon-day silence, these two strange men,\nthe one a poet by nature, the other by training, both out of tune with\ntheir world, dreamers, introspective, morbid, lost and unfamiliar at\nthat end-of-the-century time, searching for a sign, groping and baffled\namidst the perplexing obscurity of the Delusion, sat over empty wine\nglasses, silent with the pervading silence that surrounded them, hearing\nonly the cooing of doves and the drone of bees, the quiet so profound,\nthat at length they could plainly distinguish at intervals the puffing\nand coughing of a locomotive switching cars in the station yard of\nBonneville.\n\nIt was, no doubt, this jarring sound that at length roused Presley from\nhis lethargy. The two friends rose; Solotari very sleepily came forward;\nthey paid for the luncheon, and stepping out into the heat and glare of\nthe streets of the town, passed on through it and took the road that led\nnorthward across a corner of Dyke's hop fields. They were bound for the\nhills in the northeastern corner of Quien Sabe. It was the same walk\nwhich Presley had taken on the previous occasion when he had first met\nVanamee herding the sheep. This encompassing detour around the whole\ncountry-side was a favorite pastime of his and he was anxious that\nVanamee should share his pleasure in it.\n\nBut soon after leaving Guadalajara, they found themselves upon the land\nthat Dyke had bought and upon which he was to raise his famous crop of\nhops. Dyke's house was close at hand, a very pleasant little cottage,\npainted white, with green blinds and deep porches, while near it and yet\nin process of construction, were two great storehouses and a drying and\ncuring house, where the hops were to be stored and treated. All about\nwere evidences that the former engineer had already been hard at\nwork. The ground had been put in readiness to receive the crop and a\nbewildering, innumerable multitude of poles, connected with a maze of\nwire and twine, had been set out. Farther on at a turn of the road, they\ncame upon Dyke himself, driving a farm wagon loaded with more poles.\nHe was in his shirt sleeves, his massive, hairy arms bare to the elbow,\nglistening with sweat, red with heat. In his bell-like, rumbling voice,\nhe was calling to his foreman and a boy at work in stringing the poles\ntogether. At sight of Presley and Vanamee he hailed them jovially,\naddressing them as “boys,” and insisting that they should get into the\nwagon with him and drive to the house for a glass of beer. His mother\nhad only the day before returned from Marysville, where she had been\nlooking up a seminary for the little tad. She would be delighted to see\nthe two boys; besides, Vanamee must see how the little tad had grown\nsince he last set eyes on her; wouldn't know her for the same little\ngirl; and the beer had been on ice since morning. Presley and Vanamee\ncould not well refuse.\n\nThey climbed into the wagon and jolted over the uneven ground through\nthe bare forest of hop-poles to the house. Inside they found Mrs.\nDyke, an old lady with a very gentle face, who wore a cap and a very\nold-fashioned gown with hoop skirts, dusting the what-not in a corner of\nthe parlor. The two men were presented and the beer was had from off the\nice.\n\n“Mother,” said Dyke, as he wiped the froth from his great blond beard,\n“ain't Sid anywheres about? I want Mr. Vanamee to see how she has grown.\nSmartest little tad in Tulare County, boys. Can recite the whole of\n'Snow Bound,' end to end, without skipping or looking at the book. Maybe\nyou don't believe that. Mother, ain't I right--without skipping a line,\nhey?”\n\nMrs. Dyke nodded to say that it was so, but explained that Sidney was\nin Guadalajara. In putting on her new slippers for the first time the\nmorning before, she had found a dime in the toe of one of them and had\nhad the whole house by the ears ever since till she could spend it.\n\n“Was it for licorice to make her licorice water?” inquired Dyke gravely.\n\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Dyke. “I made her tell me what she was going to get\nbefore she went, and it was licorice.”\n\nDyke, though his mother protested that he was foolish and that Presley\nand Vanamee had no great interest in “young ones,” insisted upon showing\nthe visitors Sidney's copy-books. They were monuments of laborious,\nelaborate neatness, the trite moralities and ready-made aphorisms of the\nphilanthropists and publicists, repeated from page to page with wearying\ninsistence. “I, too, am an American Citizen. S. D.,” “As the Twig is\nBent the Tree is Inclined,” “Truth Crushed to Earth Will Rise Again,”\n “As for Me, Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death,” and last of all, a\nstrange intrusion amongst the mild, well-worn phrases, two legends. “My\nmotto--Public Control of Public Franchises,” and “The P. and S. W. is\nan Enemy of the State.”\n\n“I see,” commented Presley, “you mean the little tad to understand 'the\nsituation' early.”\n\n“I told him he was foolish to give that to Sid to copy,” said Mrs.\nDyke, with indulgent remonstrance. “What can she understand of public\nfranchises?”\n\n“Never mind,” observed Dyke, “she'll remember it when she grows up and\nwhen the seminary people have rubbed her up a bit, and then she'll\nbegin to ask questions and understand. And don't you make any mistake,\nmother,” he went on, “about the little tad not knowing who her dad's\nenemies are. What do you think, boys? Listen, here. Precious little I've\never told her of the railroad or how I was turned off, but the other\nday I was working down by the fence next the railroad tracks and Sid was\nthere. She'd brought her doll rags down and she was playing house behind\na pile of hop poles. Well, along comes a through freight--mixed train\nfrom Missouri points and a string of empties from New Orleans,--and when\nit had passed, what do you suppose the tad did? SHE didn't know I was\nwatching her. She goes to the fence and spits a little spit after the\ncaboose and puts out her little head and, if you'll believe me, HISSES\nat the train; and mother says she does that same every time she sees a\ntrain go by, and never crosses the tracks that she don't spit her little\nspit on 'em. What do you THINK of THAT?”\n\n“But I correct her every time,” protested Mrs. Dyke seriously. “Where\nshe picked up the trick of hissing I don't know. No, it's not funny. It\nseems dreadful to see a little girl who's as sweet and gentle as can\nbe in every other way, so venomous. She says the other little girls at\nschool and the boys, too, are all the same way. Oh, dear,” she sighed,\n“why will the General Office be so unkind and unjust? Why, I couldn't\nbe happy, with all the money in the world, if I thought that even one\nlittle child hated me--hated me so that it would spit and hiss at me.\nAnd it's not one child, it's all of them, so Sidney says; and think of\nall the grown people who hate the road, women and men, the whole county,\nthe whole State, thousands and thousands of people. Don't the managers\nand the directors of the road ever think of that? Don't they ever think\nof all the hate that surrounds them, everywhere, everywhere, and the\ngood people that just grit their teeth when the name of the road is\nmentioned? Why do they want to make the people hate them? No,” she\nmurmured, the tears starting to her eyes, “No, I tell you, Mr. Presley,\nthe men who own the railroad are wicked, bad-hearted men who don't care\nhow much the poor people suffer, so long as the road makes its eighteen\nmillion a year. They don't care whether the people hate them or love\nthem, just so long as they are afraid of them. It's not right and God\nwill punish them sooner or later.”\n\nA little after this the two young men took themselves away, Dyke\nobligingly carrying them in the wagon as far as the gate that opened\ninto the Quien Sabe ranch. On the way, Presley referred to what Mrs.\nDyke had said and led Dyke, himself, to speak of the P. and S. W.\n\n“Well,” Dyke said, “it's like this, Mr. Presley. I, personally, haven't\ngot the right to kick. With you wheat-growing people I guess it's\ndifferent, but hops, you see, don't count for much in the State. It's\nsuch a little business that the road don't want to bother themselves to\ntax it. It's the wheat growers that the road cinches. The rates on hops\nARE FAIR. I've got to admit that; I was in to Bonneville a while ago to\nfind out. It's two cents a pound, and Lord love you, that's reasonable\nenough to suit any man. No,” he concluded, “I'm on the way to make money\nnow. The road sacking me as they did was, maybe, a good thing for me,\nafter all. It came just at the right time. I had a bit of money put by\nand here was the chance to go into hops with the certainty that hops\nwould quadruple and quintuple in price inside the year. No, it was my\nchance, and though they didn't mean it by a long chalk, the railroad\npeople did me a good turn when they gave me my time--and the tad'll\nenter the seminary next fall.”\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour after they had said goodbye to the one-time\nengineer, Presley and Vanamee, tramping briskly along the road that led\nnorthward through Quien Sabe, arrived at Annixter's ranch house. At once\nthey were aware of a vast and unwonted bustle that revolved about the\nplace. They stopped a few moments looking on, amused and interested in\nwhat was going forward.\n\nThe colossal barn was finished. Its freshly white-washed sides glared\nintolerably in the sun, but its interior was as yet innocent of paint\nand through the yawning vent of the sliding doors came a delicious\nodour of new, fresh wood and shavings. A crowd of men--Annixter's farm\nhands--were swarming all about it. Some were balanced on the topmost\nrounds of ladders, hanging festoons of Japanese lanterns from tree\nto tree, and all across the front of the barn itself. Mrs. Tree, her\ndaughter Hilma and another woman were inside the barn cutting into long\nstrips bolt after bolt of red, white and blue cambric and directing\nhow these strips should be draped from the ceiling and on the walls;\neverywhere resounded the tapping of tack hammers. A farm wagon drove\nup loaded to overflowing with evergreens and with great bundles of\npalm leaves, and these were immediately seized upon and affixed as\nsupplementary decorations to the tri-coloured cambric upon the inside\nwalls of the barn. Two of the larger evergreen trees were placed on\neither side the barn door and their tops bent over to form an arch. In\nthe middle of this arch it was proposed to hang a mammoth pasteboard\nescutcheon with gold letters, spelling the word WELCOME. Piles of\nchairs, rented from I.O.O.F. hall in Bonneville, heaped themselves in\nan apparently hopeless entanglement on the ground; while at the far\nextremity of the barn a couple of carpenters clattered about the\nimpromptu staging which was to accommodate the band.\n\nThere was a strenuous gayety in the air; everybody was in the best of\nspirits. Notes of laughter continually interrupted the conversation\non every hand. At every moment a group of men involved themselves in\nuproarious horse-play. They passed oblique jokes behind their hands\nto each other--grossly veiled double-meanings meant for the women--and\nbellowed with laughter thereat, stamping on the ground. The relations\nbetween the sexes grew more intimate, the women and girls pushing the\nyoung fellows away from their sides with vigorous thrusts of their\nelbows. It was passed from group to group that Adela Vacca, a division\nsuperintendent's wife, had lost her garter; the daughter of the foreman\nof the Home ranch was kissed behind the door of the dairy-house.\n\nAnnixter, in execrable temper, appeared from time to time, hatless, his\nstiff yellow hair in wild disorder. He hurried between the barn and the\nranch house, carrying now a wickered demijohn, now a case of wine, now\na basket of lemons and pineapples. Besides general supervision, he had\nelected to assume the responsibility of composing the punch--something\nstiff, by jingo, a punch that would raise you right out of your boots; a\nregular hairlifter.\n\nThe harness room of the barn he had set apart for: himself and\nintimates. He had brought a long table down from the house and upon\nit had set out boxes of cigars, bottles of whiskey and of beer and\nthe great china bowls for the punch. It would be no fault of his, he\ndeclared, if half the number of his men friends were not uproarious\nbefore they left. His barn dance would be the talk of all Tulare County\nfor years to come. For this one day he had resolved to put all thoughts\nof business out of his head. For the matter of that, things were going\nwell enough. Osterman was back from Los Angeles with a favourable\nreport as to his affair with Disbrow and Darrell. There had been another\nmeeting of the committee. Harran Derrick had attended. Though he had\ntaken no part in the discussion, Annixter was satisfied. The Governor\nhad consented to allow Harran to “come in,” if he so desired, and\nHarran had pledged himself to share one-sixth of the campaign expenses,\nproviding these did not exceed a certain figure.\n\nAs Annixter came to the door of the barn to shout abuse at the\ndistraught Chinese cook who was cutting up lemons in the kitchen, he\ncaught sight of Presley and Vanamee and hailed them.\n\n“Hello, Pres,” he called. “Come over here and see how she looks;” he\nindicated the barn with a movement of his head. “Well, we're getting\nready for you tonight,” he went on as the two friends came up. “But\nhow we are going to get straightened out by eight o'clock I don't know.\nWould you believe that pip Caraher is short of lemons--at this last\nminute and I told him I'd want three cases of 'em as much as a month\nago, and here, just when I want a good lively saddle horse to get around\non, somebody hikes the buckskin out the corral. STOLE her, by jingo.\nI'll have the law on that thief if it breaks me--and a sixty-dollar\nsaddle 'n' head-stall gone with her; and only about half the number of\nJap lanterns that I ordered have shown up and not candles enough for\nthose. It's enough to make a dog sick. There's nothing done that you\ndon't do yourself, unless you stand over these loafers with a club. I'm\nsick of the whole business--and I've lost my hat; wish to God I'd never\ndreamed of givin' this rotten fool dance. Clutter the whole place up\nwith a lot of feemales. I sure did lose my presence of mind when I got\nTHAT idea.”\n\nThen, ignoring the fact that it was he, himself, who had called the\nyoung men to him, he added:\n\n“Well, this is my busy day. Sorry I can't stop and talk to you longer.”\n\nHe shouted a last imprecation at the Chinaman and turned back into the\nbarn. Presley and Vanamee went on, but Annixter, as he crossed the floor\nof the barn, all but collided with Hilma Tree, who came out from one of\nthe stalls, a box of candles in her arms.\n\nGasping out an apology, Annixter reentered the harness room, closing the\ndoor behind him, and forgetting all the responsibility of the moment,\nlit a cigar and sat down in one of the hired chairs, his hands in his\npockets, his feet on the table, frowning thoughtfully through the blue\nsmoke.\n\nAnnixter was at last driven to confess to himself that he could not get\nthe thought of Hilma Tree out of his mind. Finally she had “got a hold\non him.” The thing that of all others he most dreaded had happened. A\nfeemale girl had got a hold on him, and now there was no longer for him\nany such thing as peace of mind. The idea of the young woman was with\nhim continually. He went to bed with it; he got up with it. At every\nmoment of the day he was pestered with it. It interfered with his work,\ngot mixed up in his business. What a miserable confession for a man to\nmake; a fine way to waste his time. Was it possible that only the other\nday he had stood in front of the music store in Bonneville and seriously\nconsidered making Hilma a present of a music-box? Even now, the very\nthought of it made him flush with shame, and this after she had told\nhim plainly that she did not like him. He was running after her--he,\nAnnixter! He ripped out a furious oath, striking the table with his boot\nheel. Again and again he had resolved to put the whole affair from out\nhis mind. Once he had been able to do so, but of late it was becoming\nharder and harder with every successive day. He had only to close his\neyes to see her as plain as if she stood before him; he saw her in a\nglory of sunlight that set a fine tinted lustre of pale carnation and\ngold on the silken sheen of her white skin, her hair sparkled with it,\nher thick, strong neck, sloping to her shoulders with beautiful, full\ncurves, seemed to radiate the light; her eyes, brown, wide, innocent\nin expression, disclosing the full disc of the pupil upon the slightest\nprovocation, flashed in this sunlight like diamonds.\n\nAnnixter was all bewildered. With the exception of the timid little\ncreature in the glove-cleaning establishment in Sacramento, he had had\nno acquaintance with any woman. His world was harsh, crude, a world of\nmen only--men who were to be combatted, opposed--his hand was against\nnearly every one of them. Women he distrusted with the instinctive\ndistrust of the overgrown schoolboy. Now, at length, a young woman had\ncome into his life. Promptly he was struck with discomfiture, annoyed\nalmost beyond endurance, harassed, bedevilled, excited, made angry and\nexasperated. He was suspicious of the woman, yet desired her, totally\nignorant of how to approach her, hating the sex, yet drawn to the\nindividual, confusing the two emotions, sometimes even hating Hilma as\na result of this confusion, but at all times disturbed, vexed, irritated\nbeyond power of expression.\n\nAt length, Annixter cast his cigar from him and plunged again into the\nwork of the day. The afternoon wore to evening, to the accompaniment\nof wearying and clamorous endeavour. In some unexplained fashion,\nthe labour of putting the great barn in readiness for the dance was\naccomplished; the last bolt of cambric was hung in place from the\nrafters. The last evergreen tree was nailed to the joists of the\nwalls; the last lantern hung, the last nail driven into the musicians'\nplatform. The sun set. There was a great scurry to have supper and\ndress. Annixter, last of all the other workers, left the barn in the\ndusk of twilight. He was alone; he had a saw under one arm, a bag of\ntools was in his hand. He was in his shirt sleeves and carried his coat\nover his shoulder; a hammer was thrust into one of his hip pockets. He\nwas in execrable temper. The day's work had fagged him out. He had not\nbeen able to find his hat.\n\n“And the buckskin with sixty dollars' worth of saddle gone, too,” he\ngroaned. “Oh, ain't it sweet?”\n\nAt his house, Mrs. Tree had set out a cold supper for him, the\ninevitable dish of prunes serving as dessert. After supper Annixter\nbathed and dressed. He decided at the last moment to wear his usual\ntown-going suit, a sack suit of black, made by a Bonneville tailor. But\nhis hat was gone. There were other hats he might have worn, but because\nthis particular one was lost he fretted about it all through his\ndressing and then decided to have one more look around the barn for it.\n\nFor over a quarter of an hour he pottered about the barn, going from\nstall to stall, rummaging the harness room and feed room, all to no\npurpose. At last he came out again upon the main floor, definitely\ngiving up the search, looking about him to see if everything was in\norder.\n\nThe festoons of Japanese lanterns in and around the barn were not yet\nlighted, but some half-dozen lamps, with great, tin reflectors, that\nhung against the walls, were burning low. A dull half light pervaded the\nvast interior, hollow, echoing, leaving the corners and roof thick with\nimpenetrable black shadows. The barn faced the west and through the open\nsliding doors was streaming a single bright bar from the after-glow,\nincongruous and out of all harmony with the dull flare of the kerosene\nlamps.\n\nAs Annixter glanced about him, he saw a figure step briskly out of the\nshadows of one corner of the building, pause for the fraction of one\ninstant in the bar of light, then, at sight of him, dart back again.\nThere was a sound of hurried footsteps.\n\nAnnixter, with recollections of the stolen buckskin in his mind, cried\nout sharply:\n\n“Who's there?”\n\nThere was no answer. In a second his pistol was in his hand.\n\n“Who's there? Quick, speak up or I'll shoot.”\n\n“No, no, no, don't shoot,” cried an answering voice. “Oh, be careful.\nIt's I--Hilma Tree.”\n\nAnnixter slid the pistol into his pocket with a great qualm of\napprehension. He came forward and met Hilma in the doorway.\n\n“Good Lord,” he murmured, “that sure did give me a start. If I HAD\nshot----”\n\nHilma stood abashed and confused before him. She was dressed in a white\norgandie frock of the most rigorous simplicity and wore neither flower\nnor ornament. The severity of her dress made her look even larger than\nusual, and even as it was her eyes were on a level with Annixter's.\nThere was a certain fascination in the contradiction of stature and\ncharacter of Hilma--a great girl, half-child as yet, but tall as a man\nfor all that.\n\nThere was a moment's awkward silence, then Hilma explained:\n\n“I--I came back to look for my hat. I thought I left it here this\nafternoon.”\n\n“And I was looking for my hat,” cried Annixter. “Funny enough, hey?”\n\nThey laughed at this as heartily as children might have done. The\nconstraint of the situation was a little relaxed and Annixter, with\nsudden directness, glanced sharply at the young woman and demanded:\n\n“Well, Miss Hilma, hate me as much as ever?”\n\n“Oh, no, sir,” she answered, “I never said I hated you.”\n\n“Well,--dislike me, then; I know you said that.”\n\n“I--I disliked what you did--TRIED to do. It made me angry and it hurt\nme. I shouldn't have said what I did that time, but it was your fault.”\n\n“You mean you shouldn't have said you didn't like me?” asked Annixter.\n“Why?”\n\n“Well, well,--I don't--I don't DISlike anybody,” admitted Hilma.\n\n“Then I can take it that you don't dislike ME? Is that it?”\n\n“I don't dislike anybody,” persisted Hilma.\n\n“Well, I asked you more than that, didn't I?” queried Annixter uneasily.\n“I asked you to like me, remember, the other day. I'm asking you that\nagain, now. I want you to like me.”\n\nHilma lifted her eyes inquiringly to his. In her words was an\nunmistakable ring of absolute sincerity. Innocently she inquired:\n\n“Why?”\n\nAnnixter was struck speechless. In the face of such candour, such\nperfect ingenuousness, he was at a loss for any words.\n\n“Well--well,” he stammered, “well--I don't know,” he suddenly burst out.\n“That is,” he went on, groping for his wits, “I can't quite say why.”\n The idea of a colossal lie occurred to him, a thing actually royal.\n\n“I like to have the people who are around me like me,” he declared.\n“I--I like to be popular, understand? Yes, that's it,” he continued,\nmore reassured. “I don't like the idea of any one disliking me. That's\nthe way I am. It's my nature.”\n\n“Oh, then,” returned Hilma, “you needn't bother. No, I don't dislike\nyou.”\n\n“Well, that's good,” declared Annixter judicially. “That's good. But\nhold on,” he interrupted, “I'm forgetting. It's not enough to not\ndislike me. I want you to like me. How about THAT?”\n\nHilma paused for a moment, glancing vaguely out of the doorway toward\nthe lighted window of the dairy-house, her head tilted.\n\n“I don't know that I ever thought about that,” she said.\n\n“Well, think about it now,” insisted Annixter.\n\n“But I never thought about liking anybody particularly,” she observed.\n“It's because I like everybody, don't you see?”\n\n“Well, you've got to like some people more than other people,” hazarded\nAnnixter, “and I want to be one of those 'some people,' savvy? Good\nLord, I don't know how to say these fool things. I talk like a galoot\nwhen I get talking to feemale girls and I can't lay my tongue to\nanything that sounds right. It isn't my nature. And look here, I lied\nwhen I said I liked to have people like me--to be popular. Rot! I don't\ncare a curse about people's opinions of me. But there's a few\npeople that are more to me than most others--that chap Presley, for\ninstance--and those people I DO want to have like me. What they think\ncounts. Pshaw! I know I've got enemies; piles of them. I could name you\nhalf a dozen men right now that are naturally itching to take a shot at\nme. How about this ranch? Don't I know, can't I hear the men growling\noaths under their breath after I've gone by? And in business ways, too,”\n he went on, speaking half to himself, “in Bonneville and all over the\ncounty there's not a man of them wouldn't howl for joy if they got a\nchance to down Buck Annixter. Think I care? Why, I LIKE it. I run my\nranch to suit myself and I play my game my own way. I'm a 'driver,'\nI know it, and a 'bully,' too. Oh, I know what they call me--'a brute\nbeast, with a twist in my temper that would rile up a new-born lamb,'\nand I'm 'crusty' and 'pig-headed' and 'obstinate.' They say all that,\nbut they've got to say, too, that I'm cleverer than any man-jack in the\nrunning. There's nobody can get ahead of me.” His eyes snapped. “Let 'em\ngrind their teeth. They can't 'down' me. When I shut my fist there's\nnot one of them can open it. No, not with a CHISEL.” He turned to Hilma\nagain. “Well, when a man's hated as much as that, it stands to reason,\ndon't it, Miss Hilma, that the few friends he has got he wants to keep?\nI'm not such an entire swine to the people that know me best--that\njackass, Presley, for instance. I'd put my hand in the fire to do him\na real service. Sometimes I get kind of lonesome; wonder if you would\nunderstand? It's my fault, but there's not a horse about the place that\ndon't lay his ears back when I get on him; there's not a dog don't put\nhis tail between his legs as soon as I come near him. The cayuse isn't\nfoaled yet here on Quien Sabe that can throw me, nor the dog whelped\nthat would dare show his teeth at me. I kick that Irish setter every\ntime I see him--but wonder what I'd do, though, if he didn't slink so\nmuch, if he wagged his tail and was glad to see me? So it all comes to\nthis: I'd like to have you--well, sort of feel that I was a good friend\nof yours and like me because of it.”\n\nThe flame in the lamp on the wall in front of Hilma stretched upward\ntall and thin and began to smoke. She went over to where the lamp hung\nand, standing on tip-toe, lowered the wick. As she reached her hand\nup, Annixter noted how the sombre, lurid red of the lamp made a warm\nreflection on her smooth, round arm.\n\n“Do you understand?” he queried.\n\n“Yes, why, yes,” she answered, turning around. “It's very good of you to\nwant to be a friend of mine. I didn't think so, though, when you tried\nto kiss me. But maybe it's all right since you've explained things. You\nsee I'm different from you. I like everybody to like me and I like to\nlike everybody. It makes one so much happier. You wouldn't believe it,\nbut you ought to try it, sir, just to see. It's so good to be good to\npeople and to have people good to you. And everybody has always been\nso good to me. Mamma and papa, of course, and Billy, the stableman, and\nMontalegre, the Portugee foreman, and the Chinese cook, even, and Mr.\nDelaney--only he went away--and Mrs. Vacca and her little----”\n\n“Delaney, hey?” demanded Annixter abruptly. “You and he were pretty good\nfriends, were you?”\n\n“Oh, yes,” she answered. “He was just as GOOD to me. Every day in the\nsummer time he used to ride over to the Seed ranch back of the Mission\nand bring me a great armful of flowers, the prettiest things, and I used\nto pretend to pay him for them with dollars made of cheese that I cut\nout of the cheese with a biscuit cutter. It was such fun. We were the\nbest of friends.”\n\n“There's another lamp smoking,” growled Annixter. “Turn it down, will\nyou?--and see that somebody sweeps this floor here. It's all littered up\nwith pine needles. I've got a lot to do. Good-bye.”\n\n“Good-bye, sir.”\n\nAnnixter returned to the ranch house, his teeth clenched, enraged, his\nface flushed.\n\n“Ah,” he muttered, “Delaney, hey? Throwing it up to me that I fired\nhim.” His teeth gripped together more fiercely than ever. “The best\nof friends, hey? By God, I'll have that girl yet. I'll show that\ncow-puncher. Ain't I her employer, her boss? I'll show her--and Delaney,\ntoo. It would be easy enough--and then Delaney can have her--if he wants\nher--after me.”\n\nAn evil light flashing from under his scowl, spread over his face. The\nmale instincts of possession, unreasoned, treacherous, oblique, came\ntwisting to the surface. All the lower nature of the man, ignorant of\nwomen, racked at one and the same time with enmity and desire, roused\nitself like a hideous and abominable beast. And at the same moment,\nHilma returned to her house, humming to herself as she walked, her white\ndress glowing with a shimmer of faint saffron light in the last ray of\nthe after-glow.\n\nA little after half-past seven, the first carry-all, bearing the\ndruggist of Bonneville and his women-folk, arrived in front of the new\nbarn. Immediately afterward an express wagon loaded down with a\nswarming family of Spanish-Mexicans, gorgeous in red and yellow colours,\nfollowed. Billy, the stableman, and his assistant took charge of the\nteams, unchecking the horses and hitching them to a fence back of the\nbarn. Then Caraher, the saloon-keeper, in “derby” hat, “Prince Albert”\n coat, pointed yellow shoes and inevitable red necktie, drove into the\nyard on his buckboard, the delayed box of lemons under the seat. It\nlooked as if the whole array of invited guests was to arrive in one\nunbroken procession, but for a long half-hour nobody else appeared.\nAnnixter and Caraher withdrew to the harness room and promptly involved\nthemselves in a wrangle as to the make-up of the famous punch. From time\nto time their voices could be heard uplifted in clamorous argument.\n\n“Two quarts and a half and a cupful of chartreuse.”\n\n“Rot, rot, I know better. Champagne straight and a dash of brandy.”\n\nThe druggist's wife and sister retired to the feed room, where a bureau\nwith a swinging mirror had been placed for the convenience of the women.\nThe druggist stood awkwardly outside the door of the feed room, his coat\ncollar turned up against the draughts that drifted through the barn, his\nface troubled, debating anxiously as to the propriety of putting on his\ngloves. The Spanish-Mexican family, a father, mother and five children\nand sister-in-law, sat rigid on the edges of the hired chairs, silent,\nconstrained, their eyes lowered, their elbows in at their sides,\nglancing furtively from under their eyebrows at the decorations or\nwatching with intense absorption young Vacca, son of one of the division\nsuperintendents, who wore a checked coat and white thread gloves and\nwho paced up and down the length of the barn, frowning, very important,\nwhittling a wax candle over the floor to make it slippery for dancing.\n\nThe musicians arrived, the City Band of Bonneville--Annixter having\nmanaged to offend the leader of the “Dirigo” Club orchestra, at the very\nlast moment, to such a point that he had refused his services. These\nmembers of the City Band repaired at once to their platform in the\ncorner. At every instant they laughed uproariously among themselves,\njoshing one of their number, a Frenchman, whom they called “Skeezicks.”\n Their hilarity reverberated in a hollow, metallic roll among the rafters\noverhead. The druggist observed to young Vacca as he passed by that he\nthought them pretty fresh, just the same.\n\n“I'm busy, I'm very busy,” returned the young man, continuing on his\nway, still frowning and paring the stump of candle.\n\n“Two quarts 'n' a half. Two quarts 'n' a half.”\n\n“Ah, yes, in a way, that's so; and then, again, in a way, it ISN'T. I\nknow better.”\n\nAll along one side of the barn were a row of stalls, fourteen of them,\nclean as yet, redolent of new cut wood, the sawdust still in the cracks\nof the flooring. Deliberately the druggist went from one to the other,\npausing contemplatively before each. He returned down the line and again\ntook up his position by the door of the feed room, nodding his head\njudicially, as if satisfied. He decided to put on his gloves.\n\nBy now it was quite dark. Outside, between the barn and the ranch houses\none could see a group of men on step-ladders lighting the festoons of\nJapanese lanterns. In the darkness, only their faces appeared here and\nthere, high above the ground, seen in a haze of red, strange, grotesque.\nGradually as the multitude of lanterns were lit, the light spread.\nThe grass underfoot looked like green excelsior. Another group of men\ninvaded the barn itself, lighting the lamps and lanterns there. Soon\nthe whole place was gleaming with points of light. Young Vacca, who had\ndisappeared, returned with his pockets full of wax candles. He resumed\nhis whittling, refusing to answer any questions, vociferating that he\nwas busy.\n\nOutside there was a sound of hoofs and voices. More guests had arrived.\nThe druggist, seized with confusion, terrified lest he had put on his\ngloves too soon, thrust his hands into his pockets. It was Cutter,\nMagnus Derrick's division superintendent, who came, bringing his wife\nand her two girl cousins. They had come fifteen miles by the trail from\nthe far distant division house on “Four” of Los Muertos and had ridden\non horseback instead of driving. Mrs. Cutter could be heard declaring\nthat she was nearly dead and felt more like going to bed than dancing.\nThe two girl cousins, in dresses of dotted Swiss over blue sateen, were\ndoing their utmost to pacify her. She could be heard protesting from\nmoment to moment. One distinguished the phrases “straight to my bed,”\n “back nearly broken in two,” “never wanted to come in the first place.”\n The druggist, observing Cutter take a pair of gloves from Mrs. Cutter's\nreticule, drew his hands from his pockets.\n\nBut abruptly there was an interruption. In the musicians' corner\na scuffle broke out. A chair was overturned. There was a noise of\nimprecations mingled with shouts of derision. Skeezicks, the Frenchman,\nhad turned upon the joshers.\n\n“Ah, no,” he was heard to exclaim, “at the end of the end it is too\nmuch. Kind of a bad canary--we will go to see about that. Aha, let him\nclose up his face before I demolish it with a good stroke of the fist.”\n\nThe men who were lighting the lanterns were obliged to intervene before\nhe could be placated.\n\nHooven and his wife and daughters arrived. Minna was carrying little\nHilda, already asleep, in her arms. Minna looked very pretty, striking\neven, with her black hair, pale face, very red lips and greenish-blue\neyes. She was dressed in what had been Mrs. Hooven's wedding gown, a\ncheap affair of “farmer's satin.” Mrs. Hooven had pendent earrings\nof imitation jet in her ears. Hooven was wearing an old frock coat of\nMagnus Derrick's, the sleeves too long, the shoulders absurdly too wide.\nHe and Cutter at once entered into an excited conversation as to the\nownership of a certain steer.\n\n“Why, the brand----”\n\n“Ach, Gott, der brendt,” Hooven clasped his head, “ach, der brendt, dot\nmaks me laugh some laughs. Dot's goot--der brendt--doand I see um--shoor\nder boole mit der bleck star bei der vore-head in der middle oaf. Any\nsomeones you esk tell you dot is mein boole. You esk any someones. Der\nbrendt? To hell mit der brendt. You aindt got some memorie aboudt does\nting I guess nodt.”\n\n“Please step aside, gentlemen,” said young Vacca, who was still making\nthe rounds of the floor.\n\nHooven whirled about. “Eh? What den,” he exclaimed, still excited,\nwilling to be angry at any one for the moment. “Doand you push soh, you.\nI tink berhapz you doand OWN dose barn, hey?”\n\n“I'm busy, I'm very busy.” The young man pushed by with grave\npreoccupation.\n\n“Two quarts 'n' a half. Two quarts 'n' a half.”\n\n“I know better. That's all rot.”\n\nBut the barn was filling up rapidly. At every moment there was a rattle\nof a newly arrived vehicle from outside. Guest after guest appeared\nin the doorway, singly or in couples, or in families, or in garrulous\nparties of five and six. Now it was Phelps and his mother from Los\nMuertos, now a foreman from Broderson's with his family, now a gayly\napparelled clerk from a Bonneville store, solitary and bewildered,\nlooking for a place to put his hat, now a couple of Spanish-Mexican\ngirls from Guadalajara with coquettish effects of black and yellow about\ntheir dress, now a group of Osterman's tenants, Portuguese, swarthy,\nwith plastered hair and curled mustaches, redolent of cheap perfumes.\nSarria arrived, his smooth, shiny face glistening with perspiration. He\nwore a new cassock and carried his broad-brimmed hat under his arm. His\nappearance made quite a stir. He passed from group to group, urbane,\naffable, shaking hands right and left; he assumed a set smile of\namiability which never left his face the whole evening.\n\nBut abruptly there was a veritable sensation. From out the little crowd\nthat persistently huddled about the doorway came Osterman. He wore\na dress-suit with a white waistcoat and patent leather pumps--what\na wonder! A little qualm of excitement spread around the barn. One\nexchanged nudges of the elbow with one's neighbour, whispering earnestly\nbehind the hand. What astonishing clothes! Catch on to the coat-tails!\nIt was a masquerade costume, maybe; that goat Osterman was such a\njosher, one never could tell what he would do next.\n\nThe musicians began to tune up. From their corner came a medley of\nmellow sounds, the subdued chirps of the violins, the dull bourdon of\nthe bass viol, the liquid gurgling of the flageolet and the deep-toned\nsnarl of the big horn, with now and then a rasping stridulating of the\nsnare drum. A sense of gayety began to spread throughout the assembly.\nAt every moment the crowd increased. The aroma of new-sawn timber\nand sawdust began to be mingled with the feminine odour of sachet and\nflowers. There was a babel of talk in the air--male baritone and soprano\nchatter--varied by an occasional note of laughter and the swish of\nstiffly starched petticoats. On the row of chairs that went around three\nsides of the wall groups began to settle themselves. For a long time\nthe guests huddled close to the doorway; the lower end of the floor\nwas crowded! the upper end deserted; but by degrees the lines of white\nmuslin and pink and blue sateen extended, dotted with the darker figures\nof men in black suits. The conversation grew louder as the timidity of\nthe early moments wore off. Groups at a distance called back and forth;\nconversations were carried on at top voice. Once, even a whole party\nhurried across the floor from one side of the barn to the other.\n\nAnnixter emerged from the harness room, his face red with wrangling. He\ntook a position to the right of the door, shaking hands with newcomers,\ninviting them over and over again to cut loose and whoop it along. Into\nthe ears of his more intimate male acquaintances he dropped a word as\nto punch and cigars in the harness room later on, winking with vast\nintelligence. Ranchers from remoter parts of the country appeared:\nGarnett, from the Ruby rancho, Keast, from the ranch of the same name,\nGethings, of the San Pablo, Chattern, of the Bonanza, and others and\nstill others, a score of them--elderly men, for the most part, bearded,\nslow of speech, deliberate, dressed in broadcloth. Old Broderson, who\nentered with his wife on his arm, fell in with this type, and with them\ncame a certain Dabney, of whom nothing but his name was known, a silent\nold man, who made no friends, whom nobody knew or spoke to, who was seen\nonly upon such occasions as this, coming from no one knew where, going,\nno one cared to inquire whither.\n\nBetween eight and half-past, Magnus Derrick and his family were seen.\nMagnus's entry caused no little impression. Some said: “There's the\nGovernor,” and called their companions' attention to the thin,\nerect figure, commanding, imposing, dominating all in his immediate\nneighbourhood. Harran came with him, wearing a cut-away suit of black.\nHe was undeniably handsome, young and fresh looking, his cheeks highly\ncoloured, quite the finest looking of all the younger men; blond,\nstrong, with that certain courtliness of manner that had always made him\nliked. He took his mother upon his arm and conducted her to a seat by\nthe side of Mrs. Broderson.\n\nAnnie Derrick was very pretty that evening. She was dressed in a grey\nsilk gown with a collar of pink velvet. Her light brown hair that yet\nretained so much of its brightness was transfixed by a high, shell comb,\nvery Spanish. But the look of uneasiness in her large eyes--the eyes of\na young girl--was deepening every day. The expression of innocence\nand inquiry which they so easily assumed, was disturbed by a faint\nsuggestion of aversion, almost of terror. She settled herself in her\nplace, in the corner of the hall, in the rear rank of chairs, a little\nfrightened by the glare of lights, the hum of talk and the shifting\ncrowd, glad to be out of the way, to attract no attention, willing to\nobliterate herself.\n\nAll at once Annixter, who had just shaken hands with Dyke, his mother\nand the little tad, moved abruptly in his place, drawing in his breath\nsharply. The crowd around the great, wide-open main door of the barn had\nsomewhat thinned out and in the few groups that still remained there he\nhad suddenly recognised Mr. and Mrs. Tree and Hilma, making their way\ntowards some empty seats near the entrance of the feed room.\n\nIn the dusky light of the barn earlier in the evening, Annixter had not\nbeen able to see Hilma plainly. Now, however, as she passed before his\neyes in the glittering radiance of the lamps and lanterns, he caught\nhis breath in astonishment. Never had she appeared more beautiful in his\neyes. It did not seem possible that this was the same girl whom he saw\nevery day in and around the ranch house and dairy, the girl of simple\ncalico frocks and plain shirt waists, who brought him his dinner, who\nmade up his bed. Now he could not take his eyes from her. Hilma, for\nthe first time, was wearing her hair done high upon her head. The thick,\nsweet-smelling masses, bitumen brown in the shadows, corruscated like\ngolden filaments in the light. Her organdie frock was long, longer than\nany she had yet worn. It left a little of her neck and breast bare and\nall of her arm.\n\nAnnixter muttered an exclamation. Such arms! How did she manage to\nkeep them hid on ordinary occasions. Big at the shoulder, tapering with\ndelicious modulations to the elbow and wrist, overlaid with a delicate,\ngleaming lustre. As often as she turned her head the movement sent\na slow undulation over her neck and shoulders, the pale amber-tinted\nshadows under her chin, coming and going over the creamy whiteness of\nthe skin like the changing moire of silk. The pretty rose colour of\nher cheek had deepened to a pale carnation. Annixter, his hands clasped\nbehind him, stood watching.\n\nIn a few moments Hilma was surrounded by a group of young men,\nclamouring for dances. They came from all corners of the barn, leaving\nthe other girls precipitately, almost rudely. There could be little\ndoubt as to who was to be the belle of the occasion. Hilma's little\ntriumph was immediate, complete. Annixter could hear her voice from time\nto time, its usual velvety huskiness vibrating to a note of exuberant\ngayety.\n\nAll at once the orchestra swung off into a march--the Grand March. There\nwas a great rush to secure “partners.” Young Vacca, still going the\nrounds, was pushed to one side. The gayly apparelled clerk from the\nBonneville store lost his head in the confusion. He could not find\nhis “partner.” He roamed wildly about the barn, bewildered, his eyes\nrolling. He resolved to prepare an elaborate programme card on the\nback of an old envelope. Rapidly the line was formed, Hilma and Harran\nDerrick in the lead, Annixter having obstinately refused to engage\nin either march, set or dance the whole evening. Soon the confused\nshuffling of feet settled to a measured cadence; the orchestra blared\nand wailed, the snare drum, rolling at exact intervals, the cornet\nmarking the time. It was half-past eight o'clock.\n\nAnnixter drew a long breath:\n\n“Good,” he muttered, “the thing is under way at last.”\n\nSingularly enough, Osterman also refused to dance. The week before\nhe had returned from Los Angeles, bursting with the importance of his\nmission. He had been successful. He had Disbrow “in his pocket.” He\nwas impatient to pose before the others of the committee as a skilful\npolitical agent, a manipulator. He forgot his attitude of the early part\nof the evening when he had drawn attention to himself with his wonderful\nclothes. Now his comic actor's face, with its brownish-red cheeks,\nprotuberant ears and horizontal slit of a mouth, was overcast\nwith gravity. His bald forehead was seamed with the wrinkles of\nresponsibility. He drew Annixter into one of the empty stalls and began\nan elaborate explanation, glib, voluble, interminable, going over again\nin detail what he had reported to the committee in outline.\n\n“I managed--I schemed--I kept dark--I lay low----”\n\nBut Annixter refused to listen.\n\n“Oh, rot your schemes. There's a punch in the harness room that will\nmake the hair grow on the top of your head in the place where the hair\nought to grow. Come on, we'll round up some of the boys and walk into\nit.”\n\nThey edged their way around the hall outside “The Grand March,” toward\nthe harness room, picking up on their way Caraher, Dyke, Hooven and old\nBroderson. Once in the harness room, Annixter shot the bolt.\n\n“That affair outside,” he observed, “will take care of itself, but\nhere's a little orphan child that gets lonesome without company.”\n\nAnnixter began ladling the punch, filling the glasses.\n\nOsterman proposed a toast to Quien Sabe and the Biggest Barn. Their\nelbows crooked in silence. Old Broderson set down his glass, wiping his\nlong beard and remarking:\n\n“That--that certainly is very--very agreeable. I remember a punch I\ndrank on Christmas day in '83, or no, it was '84--anyhow, that punch--it\nwas in Ukiah--'TWAS '83--” He wandered on aimlessly, unable to stop\nhis flow of speech, losing himself in details, involving his talk in a\nhopeless maze of trivialities to which nobody paid any attention.\n\n“I don't drink myself,” observed Dyke, “but just a taste of that with\na lot of water wouldn't be bad for the little tad. She'd think it was\nlemonade.” He was about to mix a glass for Sidney, but thought better of\nit at the last moment.\n\n“It's the chartreuse that's lacking,” commented Caraher, lowering at\nAnnixter. The other flared up on the instant.\n\n“Rot, rot. I know better. In some punches it goes; and then, again, in\nothers it don't.”\n\nBut it was left to Hooven to launch the successful phrase:\n\n“Gesundheit,” he exclaimed, holding out his second glass. After\ndrinking, he replaced it on the table with a long breath. “Ach Gott!”\n he cried, “dat poonsch, say I tink dot poonsch mek some demn goot\nvertilizer, hey?”\n\nFertiliser! The others roared with laughter.\n\n“Good eye, Bismarck,” commented Annixter. The name had a great success.\nThereafter throughout the evening the punch was invariably spoken of as\nthe “Fertiliser.” Osterman, having spilt the bottom of a glassful on\nthe floor, pretended that he saw shoots of grain coming up on the spot.\nSuddenly he turned upon old Broderson. “I'm bald, ain't I? Want to know\nhow I lost my hair? Promise you won't ask a single other question and\nI'll tell you. Promise your word of honour.”\n\n“Eh? What--wh--I--I don't understand. Your hair? Yes, I'll promise. How\ndid you lose it?”\n\n“It was bit off.”\n\nThe other gazed at him stupefied; his jaw dropped. The company shouted,\nand old Broderson, believing he had somehow accomplished a witticism,\nchuckled in his beard, wagging his head. But suddenly he fell grave,\nstruck with an idea. He demanded:\n\n“Yes--I know--but--but what bit it off?”\n\n“Ah,” vociferated Osterman, “that's JUST what you promised not to ask.”\n\nThe company doubled up with hilarity. Caraher leaned against the door,\nholding his sides, but Hooven, all abroad, unable to follow, gazed from\nface to face with a vacant grin, thinking it was still a question of his\nfamous phrase.\n\n“Vertilizer, hey? Dots some fine joke, hey? You bedt.”\n\nWhat with the noise of their talk and laughter, it was some time before\nDyke, first of all, heard a persistent knocking on the bolted door. He\ncalled Annixter's attention to the sound. Cursing the intruder, Annixter\nunbolted and opened the door. But at once his manner changed.\n\n“Hello. It's Presley. Come in, come in, Pres.”\n\nThere was a shout of welcome from the others. A spirit of effusive\ncordiality had begun to dominate the gathering. Annixter caught sight of\nVanamee back of Presley, and waiving for the moment the distinction of\nemployer and employee, insisted that both the friends should come in.\n\n“Any friend of Pres is my friend,” he declared.\n\nBut when the two had entered and had exchanged greetings, Presley drew\nAnnixter aside.\n\n“Vanamee and I have just come from Bonneville,” he explained. “We saw\nDelaney there. He's got the buckskin, and he's full of bad whiskey and\ndago-red. You should see him; he's wearing all his cow-punching outfit,\nhair trousers, sombrero, spurs and all the rest of it, and he has\nstrapped himself to a big revolver. He says he wasn't invited to your\nbarn dance but that he's coming over to shoot up the place. He says you\npromised to show him off Quien Sabe at the toe of your boot and that\nhe's going to give you the chance to-night!” “Ah,” commented Annixter,\nnodding his head, “he is, is he?”\n\nPresley was disappointed. Knowing Annixter's irascibility, he had\nexpected to produce a more dramatic effect. He began to explain the\ndanger of the business. Delaney had once knifed a greaser in the\nPanamint country. He was known as a “bad” man. But Annixter refused to\nbe drawn.\n\n“All right,” he said, “that's all right. Don't tell anybody else. You\nmight scare the girls off. Get in and drink.”\n\nOutside the dancing was by this time in full swing. The orchestra\nwas playing a polka. Young Vacca, now at his fiftieth wax candle, had\nbrought the floor to the slippery surface of glass. The druggist was\ndancing with one of the Spanish-Mexican girls with the solemnity of an\nautomaton, turning about and about, always in the same direction, his\neyes glassy, his teeth set. Hilma Tree was dancing for the second time\nwith Harran Derrick. She danced with infinite grace. Her cheeks were\nbright red, her eyes half-closed, and through her parted lips she drew\nfrom time to time a long, tremulous breath of pure delight. The music,\nthe weaving colours, the heat of the air, by now a little oppressive,\nthe monotony of repeated sensation, even the pain of physical fatigue\nhad exalted all her senses. She was in a dreamy lethargy of happiness.\nIt was her “first ball.” She could have danced without stopping until\nmorning. Minna Hooven and Cutter were “promenading.” Mrs. Hooven, with\nlittle Hilda already asleep on her knees, never took her eyes from\nher daughter's gown. As often as Minna passed near her she vented an\nenergetic “pst! pst!” The metal tip of a white draw string was showing\nfrom underneath the waist of Minna's dress. Mrs. Hooven was on the point\nof tears.\n\nThe solitary gayly apparelled clerk from Bonneville was in a fever of\nagitation. He had lost his elaborate programme card. Bewildered, beside\nhimself with trepidation, he hurried about the room, jostled by the\ndancing couples, tripping over the feet of those who were seated;\nhe peered distressfully under the chairs and about the floor, asking\nanxious questions.\n\nMagnus Derrick, the centre of a listening circle of ranchers--Garnett\nfrom the Ruby rancho, Keast from the ranch of the same name, Gethings\nand Chattern of the San Pablo and Bonanza--stood near the great open\ndoorway of the barn, discussing the possibility of a shortage in the\nworld's wheat crop for the next year.\n\nAbruptly the orchestra ceased playing with a roll of the snare drum, a\nflourish of the cornet and a prolonged growl of the bass viol. The\ndance broke up, the couples hurrying to their seats, leaving the gayly\napparelled clerk suddenly isolated in the middle of the floor, rolling\nhis eyes. The druggist released the Spanish-Mexican girl with mechanical\nprecision out amidst the crowd of dancers. He bowed, dropping his chin\nupon his cravat; throughout the dance neither had hazarded a word.\nThe girl found her way alone to a chair, but the druggist, sick from\ncontinually revolving in the same direction, walked unsteadily toward\nthe wall. All at once the barn reeled around him; he fell down. There\nwas a great laugh, but he scrambled to his feet and disappeared abruptly\nout into the night through the doorway of the barn, deathly pale, his\nhand upon his stomach.\n\nDabney, the old man whom nobody knew, approached the group of ranchers\naround Magnus Derrick and stood, a little removed, listening gravely\nto what the governor was saying, his chin sunk in his collar, silent,\noffering no opinions.\n\nBut the leader of the orchestra, with a great gesture of his violin bow,\ncried out:\n\n“All take partners for the lancers and promenade around the hall!”\n\nHowever, there was a delay. A little crowd formed around the musicians'\nplatform; voices were raised; there was a commotion. Skeezicks, who\nplayed the big horn, accused the cornet and the snare-drum of stealing\nhis cold lunch. At intervals he could be heard expostulating:\n\n“Ah, no! at the end of the end! Render me the sausages, you, or less I\nbreak your throat! Aha! I know you. You are going to play me there a\nbad farce. My sausages and the pork sandwich, else I go away from this\nplace!”\n\nHe made an exaggerated show of replacing his big horn in its case, but\nthe by-standers raised a great protest. The sandwiches and one sausage\nwere produced; the other had disappeared. In the end Skeezichs allowed\nhimself to be appeased. The dance was resumed.\n\nHalf an hour later the gathering in the harness room was considerably\nreinforced. It was the corner of the barn toward which the male guests\nnaturally gravitated. Harran Derrick, who only cared to dance with Hilma\nTree, was admitted. Garnett from the Ruby rancho and Gethings from\nthe San Pablo, came in a little afterwards. A fourth bowl of punch was\nmixed, Annixter and Caraher clamouring into each other's face as to its\ningredients. Cigars were lighted. Soon the air of the room became blue\nwith an acrid haze of smoke. It was very warm. Ranged in their chairs\naround the side of the room, the guests emptied glass after glass.\n\nVanamee alone refused to drink. He sat a little to one side,\ndisassociating himself from what was going forward, watching the others\ncalmly, a little contemptuously, a cigarette in his fingers.\n\nHooven, after drinking his third glass, however, was afflicted with a\ngreat sadness; his breast heaved with immense sighs. He asserted that he\nwas “obbressed;” Cutter had taken his steer. He retired to a corner and\nseated himself in a heap on his chair, his heels on the rungs, wiping\nthe tears from his eyes, refusing to be comforted. Old Broderson\nstartled Annixter, who sat next to him, out of all measure by suddenly\nwinking at him with infinite craftiness.\n\n“When I was a lad in Ukiah,” he whispered hoarsely, “I was a devil of a\nfellow with the girls; but Lordy!” he nudged him slyly, “I wouldn't have\nit known!”\n\nOf those who were drinking, Annixter alone retained all his wits. Though\nkeeping pace with the others, glass for glass, the punch left him solid\nupon his feet, clear-headed. The tough, cross-grained fibre of him\nseemed proof against alcohol. Never in his life had he been drunk. He\nprided himself upon his power of resistance. It was his nature.\n\n“Say!” exclaimed old Broderson, gravely addressing the company, pulling\nat his beard uneasily--“say! I--I--listen! I'm a devil of a fellow with\nthe girls.” He wagged his head doggedly, shutting his eyes in a knowing\nfashion. “Yes, sir, I am. There was a young lady in Ukiah--that was\nwhen I was a lad of seventeen. We used to meet in the cemetery in the\nafternoons. I was to go away to school at Sacramento, and the afternoon\nI left we met in the cemetery and we stayed so long I almost missed the\ntrain. Her name was Celestine.”\n\nThere was a pause. The others waited for the rest of the story.\n\n“And afterwards?” prompted Annixter.\n\n“Afterwards? Nothing afterwards. I never saw her again. Her name was\nCelestine.”\n\nThe company raised a chorus of derision, and Osterman cried ironically:\n\n“Say! THAT'S a pretty good one! Tell us another.”\n\nThe old man laughed with the rest, believing he had made another hit. He\ncalled Osterman to him, whispering in his ear:\n\n“Sh! Look here! Some night you and I will go up to San Francisco--hey?\nWe'll go skylarking. We'll be gay. Oh, I'm a--a--a rare old BUCK, I am!\nI ain't too old. You'll see.”\n\nAnnixter gave over the making of the fifth bowl of punch to Osterman,\nwho affirmed that he had a recipe for a “fertiliser” from Solotari\nthat would take the plating off the ladle. He left him wrangling with\nCaraher, who still persisted in adding chartreuse, and stepped out into\nthe dance to see how things were getting on.\n\nIt was the interval between two dances. In and around a stall at the\nfarther end of the floor, where lemonade was being served, was a great\nthrong of young men. Others hurried across the floor singly or by twos\nand threes, gingerly carrying overflowing glasses to their “partners,”\n sitting in long rows of white and blue and pink against the opposite\nwall, their mothers and older sisters in a second dark-clothed rank\nbehind them. A babel of talk was in the air, mingled with gusts of\nlaughter. Everybody seemed having a good time. In the increasing heat\nthe decorations of evergreen trees and festoons threw off a pungent\naroma that suggested a Sunday-school Christmas festival. In the other\nstalls, lower down the barn, the young men had brought chairs, and in\nthese deep recesses the most desperate love-making was in progress, the\nyoung man, his hair neatly parted, leaning with great solicitation over\nthe girl, his “partner” for the moment, fanning her conscientiously, his\narm carefully laid along the back of her chair.\n\nBy the doorway, Annixter met Sarria, who had stepped out to smoke a fat,\nblack cigar. The set smile of amiability was still fixed on the priest's\nsmooth, shiny face; the cigar ashes had left grey streaks on the front\nof his cassock. He avoided Annixter, fearing, no doubt, an allusion\nto his game cocks, and took up his position back of the second rank of\nchairs by the musicians' stand, beaming encouragingly upon every one who\ncaught his eye.\n\nAnnixter was saluted right and left as he slowly went the round of the\nfloor. At every moment he had to pause to shake hands and to listen to\ncongratulations upon the size of his barn and the success of his dance.\nBut he was distrait, his thoughts elsewhere; he did not attempt to\nhide his impatience when some of the young men tried to engage him in\nconversation, asking him to be introduced to their sisters, or their\nfriends' sisters. He sent them about their business harshly, abominably\nrude, leaving a wake of angry disturbance behind him, sowing the seeds\nof future quarrels and renewed unpopularity. He was looking for Hilma\nTree.\n\nWhen at last he came unexpectedly upon her, standing near where Mrs.\nTree was seated, some half-dozen young men hovering uneasily in her\nneighbourhood, all his audacity was suddenly stricken from him; his\ngruffness, his overbearing insolence vanished with an abruptness that\nleft him cold. His old-time confusion and embarrassment returned to him.\nInstead of speaking to her as he intended, he affected not to see her,\nbut passed by, his head in the air, pretending a sudden interest in a\nJapanese lantern that was about to catch fire.\n\nBut he had had a single distinct glimpse of her, definite, precise,\nand this glimpse was enough. Hilma had changed. The change was\nsubtle, evanescent, hard to define, but not the less unmistakable. The\nexcitement, the enchanting delight, the delicious disturbance of “the\nfirst ball,” had produced its result. Perhaps there had only been this\nlacking. It was hard to say, but for that brief instant of time Annixter\nwas looking at Hilma, the woman. She was no longer the young girl upon\nwhom he might look down, to whom he might condescend, whose little,\ninfantile graces were to be considered with amused toleration.\n\nWhen Annixter returned to the harness room, he let himself into a\nclamour of masculine hilarity. Osterman had, indeed, made a marvellous\n“fertiliser,” whiskey for the most part, diluted with champagne and\nlemon juice. The first round of this drink had been welcomed with\na salvo of cheers. Hooven, recovering his spirits under its violent\nstimulation, spoke of “heving ut oudt mit Cudder, bei Gott,” while\nOsterman, standing on a chair at the end of the room, shouted for a\n“few moments quiet, gentlemen,” so that he might tell a certain story\nhe knew. But, abruptly, Annixter discovered that the liquors--the\nchampagne, whiskey, brandy, and the like--were running low. This would\nnever do. He felt that he would stand disgraced if it could be\nsaid afterward that he had not provided sufficient drink at his\nentertainment. He slipped out, unobserved, and, finding two of his ranch\nhands near the doorway, sent them down to the ranch house to bring up\nall the cases of “stuff” they found there.\n\nHowever, when this matter had been attended to, Annixter did not\nimmediately return to the harness room. On the floor of the barn a\nsquare dance was under way, the leader of the City Band calling the\nfigures. Young Vacca indefatigably continued the rounds of the barn,\nparing candle after candle, possessed with this single idea of duty,\npushing the dancers out of his way, refusing to admit that the floor was\nyet sufficiently slippery. The druggist had returned indoors, and leaned\ndejected and melancholy against the wall near the doorway, unable to\ndance, his evening's enjoyment spoiled. The gayly apparelled clerk from\nBonneville had just involved himself in a deplorable incident. In a\nsearch for his handkerchief, which he had lost while trying to find his\nprogramme card, he had inadvertently wandered into the feed room, set\napart as the ladies' dressing room, at the moment when Mrs. Hooven,\nhaving removed the waist of Minna's dress, was relacing her corsets.\nThere was a tremendous scene. The clerk was ejected forcibly, Mrs.\nHooven filling all the neighbourhood with shrill expostulation. A young\nman, Minna's “partner,” who stood near the feed room door, waiting for\nher to come out, had invited the clerk, with elaborate sarcasm, to step\noutside for a moment; and the clerk, breathless, stupefied, hustled from\nhand to hand, remained petrified, with staring eyes, turning about and\nabout, looking wildly from face to face, speechless, witless, wondering\nwhat had happened.\n\nBut the square dance was over. The City Band was just beginning to play\na waltz. Annixter assuring himself that everything was going all right,\nwas picking his way across the floor, when he came upon Hilma Tree quite\nalone, and looking anxiously among the crowd of dancers.\n\n“Having a good time, Miss Hilma?” he demanded, pausing for a moment.\n\n“Oh, am I, JUST!” she exclaimed. “The best time--but I don't know what\nhas become of my partner. See! I'm left all alone--the only time this\nwhole evening,” she added proudly. “Have you seen him--my partner, sir?\nI forget his name. I only met him this evening, and I've met SO many\nI can't begin to remember half of them. He was a young man from\nBonneville--a clerk, I think, because I remember seeing him in a store\nthere, and he wore the prettiest clothes!”\n\n“I guess he got lost in the shuffle,” observed Annixter. Suddenly an\nidea occurred to him. He took his resolution in both hands. He clenched\nhis teeth.\n\n“Say! look here, Miss Hilma. What's the matter with you and I stealing\nthis one for ourselves? I don't mean to dance. I don't propose to make\na jumping-jack of myself for some galoot to give me the laugh, but we'll\nwalk around. Will you? What do you say?”\n\nHilma consented.\n\n“I'm not so VERY sorry I missed my dance with that--that--little clerk,”\n she said guiltily. “I suppose that's very bad of me, isn't it?”\n\nAnnixter fulminated a vigorous protest.\n\n“I AM so warm!” murmured Hilma, fanning herself with her handkerchief;\n“and, oh! SUCH a good time as I have had! I was so afraid that I would\nbe a wall-flower and sit up by mamma and papa the whole evening; and\nas it is, I have had every single dance, and even some dances I had to\nsplit. Oh-h!” she breathed, glancing lovingly around the barn, noting\nagain the festoons of tri-coloured cambric, the Japanese lanterns,\nflaring lamps, and “decorations” of evergreen; “oh-h! it's all so\nlovely, just like a fairy story; and to think that it can't last but for\none little evening, and that to-morrow morning one must wake up to the\nevery-day things again!”\n\n“Well,” observed Annixter doggedly, unwilling that she should forget\nwhom she ought to thank, “I did my best, and my best is as good as\nanother man's, I guess.”\n\nHilma overwhelmed him with a burst of gratitude which he gruffly\npretended to deprecate. Oh, that was all right. It hadn't cost him much.\nHe liked to see people having a good time himself, and the crowd did\nseem to be enjoying themselves. What did SHE think? Did things look\nlively enough? And how about herself--was she enjoying it?\n\nStupidly Annixter drove the question home again, at his wits' end as to\nhow to make conversation. Hilma protested volubly she would never forget\nthis night, adding:\n\n“Dance! Oh, you don't know how I love it! I didn't know myself. I could\ndance all night and never stop once!”\n\nAnnixter was smitten with uneasiness. No doubt this “promenading” was\nnot at all to her taste. Wondering what kind of a spectacle he was about\nto make of himself, he exclaimed:\n\n“Want to dance now?”\n\n“Oh, yes!” she returned.\n\nThey paused in their walk, and Hilma, facing him, gave herself into\nhis arms. Annixter shut his teeth, the perspiration starting from his\nforehead. For five years he had abandoned dancing. Never in his best\ndays had it been one of his accomplishments.\n\nThey hesitated a moment, waiting to catch the time from the musicians.\nAnother couple bore down upon them at precisely the wrong moment,\njostling them out of step. Annixter swore under his breath. His arm\nstill about the young woman, he pulled her over to one corner.\n\n“Now,” he muttered, “we'll try again.”\n\nA second time, listening to the one-two-three, one-two-three cadence of\nthe musicians, they endeavoured to get under way. Annixter waited the\nfraction of a second too long and stepped on Hilma's foot. On the third\nattempt, having worked out of the corner, a pair of dancers bumped into\nthem once more, and as they were recovering themselves another couple\ncaromed violently against Annixter so that he all but lost his footing.\nHe was in a rage. Hilma, very embarrassed, was trying not to laugh, and\nthus they found themselves, out in the middle of the floor, continually\njostled from their position, holding clumsily to each other, stammering\nexcuses into one another's faces, when Delaney arrived.\n\nHe came with the suddenness of an explosion. There was a commotion by\nthe doorway, a rolling burst of oaths, a furious stamping of hoofs, a\nwild scramble of the dancers to either side of the room, and there he\nwas. He had ridden the buckskin at a gallop straight through the doorway\nand out into the middle of the floor of the barn.\n\nOnce well inside, Delaney hauled up on the cruel spade-bit, at the same\ntime driving home the spurs, and the buckskin, without halting in her\ngait, rose into the air upon her hind feet, and coming down again with a\nthunder of iron hoofs upon the hollow floor, lashed out with both heels\nsimultaneously, her back arched, her head between her knees. It was the\nrunning buck, and had not Delaney been the hardest buster in the county,\nwould have flung him headlong like a sack of sand. But he eased off the\nbit, gripping the mare's flanks with his knees, and the buckskin, having\nlong since known her master, came to hand quivering, the bloody spume\ndripping from the bit upon the slippery floor.\n\nDelaney had arrayed himself with painful elaboration, determined to\nlook the part, bent upon creating the impression, resolved that his\nappearance at least should justify his reputation of being “bad.”\n Nothing was lacking--neither the campaign hat with upturned brim, nor\nthe dotted blue handkerchief knotted behind the neck, nor the heavy\ngauntlets stitched with red, nor--this above all--the bear-skin\n“chaparejos,” the hair trousers of the mountain cowboy, the pistol\nholster low on the thigh. But for the moment this holster was empty,\nand in his right hand, the hammer at full cock, the chamber loaded,\nthe puncher flourished his teaser, an army Colt's, the lamplight dully\nreflected in the dark blue steel.\n\nIn a second of time the dance was a bedlam. The musicians stopped with a\ndiscord, and the middle of the crowded floor bared itself instantly. It\nwas like sand blown from off a rock; the throng of guests, carried by an\nimpulse that was not to be resisted, bore back against the sides of\nthe barn, overturning chairs, tripping upon each other, falling down,\nscrambling to their feet again, stepping over one another, getting\nbehind each other, diving under chairs, flattening themselves against\nthe wall--a wild, clamouring pell-mell, blind, deaf, panic-stricken;\na confused tangle of waving arms, torn muslin, crushed flowers, pale\nfaces, tangled legs, that swept in all directions back from the centre\nof the floor, leaving Annixter and Hilma, alone, deserted, their arms\nabout each other, face to face with Delaney, mad with alcohol, bursting\nwith remembered insult, bent on evil, reckless of results.\n\nAfter the first scramble for safety, the crowd fell quiet for the\nfraction of an instant, glued to the walls, afraid to stir, struck dumb\nand motionless with surprise and terror, and in the instant's silence\nthat followed Annixter, his eyes on Delaney, muttered rapidly to Hilma:\n\n“Get back, get away to one side. The fool MIGHT shoot.”\n\nThere was a second's respite afforded while Delaney occupied himself\nin quieting the buckskin, and in that second of time, at this moment of\ncrisis, the wonderful thing occurred. Hilma, turning from Delaney, her\nhands clasped on Annixter's arm, her eyes meeting his, exclaimed:\n\n“You, too!”\n\nAnd that was all; but to Annixter it was a revelation. Never more alive\nto his surroundings, never more observant, he suddenly understood. For\nthe briefest lapse of time he and Hilma looked deep into each other's\neyes, and from that moment on, Annixter knew that Hilma cared.\n\nThe whole matter was brief as the snapping of a finger. Two words and\na glance and all was done. But as though nothing had occurred, Annixter\npushed Hilma from him, repeating harshly:\n\n“Get back, I tell you. Don't you see he's got a gun? Haven't I enough on\nmy hands without you?”\n\nHe loosed her clasp and his eyes once more on Delaney, moved diagonally\nbackwards toward the side of the barn, pushing Hilma from him. In\nthe end he thrust her away so sharply that she gave back with a long\nstagger; somebody caught her arm and drew her in, leaving Annixter alone\nonce more in the middle of the floor, his hands in his coat pockets,\nwatchful, alert, facing his enemy.\n\nBut the cow-puncher was not ready to come to grapples yet. Fearless,\nhis wits gambolling under the lash of the alcohol, he wished to make the\nmost of the occasion, maintaining the suspense, playing for the gallery.\nBy touches of the hand and knee he kept the buckskin in continual,\nnervous movement, her hoofs clattering, snorting, tossing her head,\nwhile he, himself, addressing himself to Annixter, poured out a torrent\nof invective.\n\n“Well, strike me blind if it ain't old Buck Annixter! He was going to\nshow me off Quien Sabe at the toe of his boot, was he? Well, here's\nyour chance,--with the ladies to see you do it. Gives a dance, does\nhe, high-falutin' hoe-down in his barn and forgets to invite his old\nbroncho-bustin' friend. But his friend don't forget him; no, he don't.\nHe remembers little things, does his broncho-bustin' friend. Likes to\nsee a dance hisself on occasion, his friend does. Comes anyhow, trustin'\nhis welcome will be hearty; just to see old Buck Annixter dance, just to\nshow Buck Annixter's friends how Buck can dance--dance all by hisself, a\nlittle hen-on-a-hot-plate dance when his broncho-bustin' friend asks\nhim so polite. A little dance for the ladies, Buck. This feature of\nthe entertainment is alone worth the price of admission. Tune up, Buck.\nAttention now! I'll give you the key.”\n\nHe “fanned” his revolver, spinning it about his index finger by the\ntrigger-guard with incredible swiftness, the twirling weapon a mere blur\nof blue steel in his hand. Suddenly and without any apparent cessation\nof the movement, he fired, and a little splinter of wood flipped into\nthe air at Annixter's feet.\n\n“Time!” he shouted, while the buckskin reared to the report. “Hold\non--wait a minute. This place is too light to suit. That big light\nyonder is in my eyes. Look out, I'm going to throw lead.”\n\nA second shot put out the lamp over the musicians' stand. The assembled\nguests shrieked, a frantic, shrinking quiver ran through the crowd like\nthe huddling of frightened rabbits in their pen.\n\nAnnixter hardly moved. He stood some thirty paces from the buster,\nhis hands still in his coat pockets, his eyes glistening, watchful.\nExcitable and turbulent in trifling matters, when actual bodily danger\nthreatened he was of an abnormal quiet.\n\n“I'm watching you,” cried the other. “Don't make any mistake about that.\nKeep your hands in your COAT pockets, if you'd like to live a little\nlonger, understand? And don't let me see you make a move toward your hip\nor your friends will be asked to identify you at the morgue to-morrow\nmorning. When I'm bad, I'm called the Undertaker's Friend, so I am, and\nI'm that bad to-night that I'm scared of myself. They'll have to revise\nthe census returns before I'm done with this place. Come on, now, I'm\ngetting tired waiting. I come to see a dance.”\n\n“Hand over that horse, Delaney,” said Annixter, without raising his\nvoice, “and clear out.”\n\nThe other affected to be overwhelmed with infinite astonishment, his\neyes staring. He peered down from the saddle.\n\n“Wh-a-a-t!” he exclaimed; “wh-a-a-t did you say? Why, I guess you must\nbe looking for trouble; that's what I guess.”\n\n“There's where you're wrong, m'son,” muttered Annixter, partly to\nDelaney, partly to himself. “If I was looking for trouble there wouldn't\nbe any guess-work about it.”\n\nWith the words he began firing. Delaney had hardly entered the barn\nbefore Annixter's plan had been formed. Long since his revolver was\nin the pocket of his coat, and he fired now through the coat itself,\nwithout withdrawing his hands.\n\nUntil that moment Annixter had not been sure of himself. There was\nno doubt that for the first few moments of the affair he would\nhave welcomed with joy any reasonable excuse for getting out of the\nsituation. But the sound of his own revolver gave him confidence. He\nwhipped it from his pocket and fired again.\n\nAbruptly the duel began, report following report, spurts of pale blue\nsmoke jetting like the darts of short spears between the two men,\nexpanding to a haze and drifting overhead in wavering strata. It was\nquite probable that no thought of killing each other suggested itself to\neither Annixter or Delaney. Both fired without aiming very deliberately.\nTo empty their revolvers and avoid being hit was the desire common to\nboth. They no longer vituperated each other. The revolvers spoke for\nthem.\n\nLong after, Annixter could recall this moment. For years he could\nwith but little effort reconstruct the scene--the densely packed crowd\nflattened against the sides of the barn, the festoons of lanterns, the\nmingled smell of evergreens, new wood, sachets, and powder smoke;\nthe vague clamour of distress and terror that rose from the throng of\nguests, the squealing of the buckskin, the uneven explosions of the\nrevolvers, the reverberation of trampling hoofs, a brief glimpse of\nHarran Derrick's excited face at the door of the harness room, and\nin the open space in the centre of the floor, himself and Delaney,\nmanoeuvring swiftly in a cloud of smoke.\n\nAnnixter's revolver contained but six cartridges. Already it seemed to\nhim as if he had fired twenty times. Without doubt the next shot was\nhis last. Then what? He peered through the blue haze that with every\ndischarge thickened between him and the buster. For his own safety\nhe must “place” at least one shot. Delaney's chest and shoulders rose\nsuddenly above the smoke close upon him as the distraught buckskin\nreared again. Annixter, for the first time during the fight, took\ndefinite aim, but before he could draw the trigger there was a great\nshout and he was aware of the buckskin, the bridle trailing, the saddle\nempty, plunging headlong across the floor, crashing into the line of\nchairs. Delaney was scrambling off the floor. There was blood on the\nbuster's wrist and he no longer carried his revolver. Suddenly he turned\nand ran. The crowd parted right and left before him as he made toward\nthe doorway. He disappeared.\n\nTwenty men promptly sprang to the buckskin's head, but she broke away,\nand wild with terror, bewildered, blind, insensate, charged into the\ncorner of the barn by the musicians' stand. She brought up against the\nwall with cruel force and with impact of a sack of stones; her head was\ncut. She turned and charged again, bull-like, the blood streaming from\nher forehead. The crowd, shrieking, melted before her rush. An old\nman was thrown down and trampled. The buckskin trod upon the dragging\nbridle, somersaulted into a confusion of chairs in one corner, and came\ndown with a terrific clatter in a wild disorder of kicking hoofs and\nsplintered wood. But a crowd of men fell upon her, tugging at the bit,\nsitting on her head, shouting, gesticulating. For five minutes she\nstruggled and fought; then, by degrees, she recovered herself, drawing\ngreat sobbing breaths at long intervals that all but burst the girths,\nrolling her eyes in bewildered, supplicating fashion, trembling in every\nmuscle, and starting and shrinking now and then like a young girl in\nhysterics. At last she lay quiet. The men allowed her to struggle to her\nfeet. The saddle was removed and she was led to one of the empty stalls,\nwhere she remained the rest of the evening, her head low, her pasterns\nquivering, turning her head apprehensively from time to time, showing\nthe white of one eye and at long intervals heaving a single prolonged\nsigh.\n\nAnd an hour later the dance was progressing as evenly as though nothing\nin the least extraordinary had occurred. The incident was closed--that\nabrupt swoop of terror and impending death dropping down there from out\nthe darkness, cutting abruptly athwart the gayety of the moment, come\nand gone with the swiftness of a thunderclap. Many of the women had gone\nhome, taking their men with them; but the great bulk of the crowd still\nremained, seeing no reason why the episode should interfere with the\nevening's enjoyment, resolved to hold the ground for mere bravado, if\nfor nothing else. Delaney would not come back, of that everybody was\npersuaded, and in case he should, there was not found wanting fully half\na hundred young men who would give him a dressing down, by jingo! They\nhad been too surprised to act when Delaney had first appeared, and\nbefore they knew where they were at, the buster had cleared out. In\nanother minute, just another second, they would have shown him--yes,\nsir, by jingo!--ah, you bet!\n\nOn all sides the reminiscences began to circulate. At least one man in\nevery three had been involved in a gun fight at some time of his life.\n“Ah, you ought to have seen in Yuba County one time--” “Why, in Butte\nCounty in the early days--” “Pshaw! this to-night wasn't anything! Why,\nonce in a saloon in Arizona when I was there--” and so on, over and over\nagain. Osterman solemnly asserted that he had seen a greaser sawn in two\nin a Nevada sawmill. Old Broderson had witnessed a Vigilante lynching in\n'55 on California Street in San Francisco. Dyke recalled how once in his\nengineering days he had run over a drunk at a street crossing. Gethings\nof the San Pablo had taken a shot at a highwayman. Hooven had bayonetted\na French Chasseur at Sedan. An old Spanish-Mexican, a centenarian from\nGuadalajara, remembered Fremont's stand on a mountain top in San Benito\nCounty. The druggist had fired at a burglar trying to break into\nhis store one New Year's eve. Young Vacca had seen a dog shot in\nGuadalajara. Father Sarria had more than once administered the\nsacraments to Portuguese desperadoes dying of gunshot wounds. Even the\nwomen recalled terrible scenes. Mrs. Cutter recounted to an interested\ngroup how she had seen a claim jumped in Placer County in 1851, when\nthree men were shot, falling in a fusillade of rifle shots, and expiring\nlater upon the floor of her kitchen while she looked on. Mrs. Dyke\nhad been in a stage hold-up, when the shotgun messenger was murdered.\nStories by the hundreds went the round of the company. The air was\nsurcharged with blood, dying groans, the reek of powder smoke, the crack\nof rifles. All the legends of '49, the violent, wild life of the early\ndays, were recalled to view, defiling before them there in an endless\nprocession under the glare of paper lanterns and kerosene lamps.\n\nBut the affair had aroused a combative spirit amongst the men of the\nassembly. Instantly a spirit of aggression, of truculence, swelled up\nunderneath waistcoats and starched shirt bosoms. More than one offender\nwas promptly asked to “step outside.” It was like young bucks excited\nby an encounter of stags, lowering their horns upon the slightest\nprovocation, showing off before the does and fawns. Old quarrels were\nremembered. One sought laboriously for slights and insults, veiled in\nordinary conversation. The sense of personal honour became refined to\na delicate, fine point. Upon the slightest pretext there was a haughty\ndrawing up of the figure, a twisting of the lips into a smile of scorn.\nCaraher spoke of shooting S. Behrman on sight before the end of the\nweek. Twice it became necessary to separate Hooven and Cutter, renewing\ntheir quarrel as to the ownership of the steer. All at once Minna\nHooven's “partner” fell upon the gayly apparelled clerk from\nBonneville, pummelling him with his fists, hustling him out of the hall,\nvociferating that Miss Hooven had been grossly insulted. It took three\nmen to extricate the clerk from his clutches, dazed, gasping, his collar\nunfastened and sticking up into his face, his eyes staring wildly into\nthe faces of the crowd.\n\nBut Annixter, bursting with pride, his chest thrown out, his chin in\nthe air, reigned enthroned in a circle of adulation. He was the Hero. To\nshake him by the hand was an honour to be struggled for. One clapped\nhim on the back with solemn nods of approval. “There's the BOY for you;”\n “There was nerve for you;” “What's the matter with Annixter?” “How about\nTHAT for sand, and how was THAT for a SHOT?” “Why, Apache Kid couldn't\nhave bettered that.” “Cool enough.” “Took a steady eye and a sure hand\nto make a shot like that.” “There was a shot that would be told about in\nTulare County fifty years to come.”\n\nAnnixter had refrained from replying, all ears to this conversation,\nwondering just what had happened. He knew only that Delaney had run,\nleaving his revolver and a spatter of blood behind him. By degrees,\nhowever, he ascertained that his last shot but one had struck Delaney's\npistol hand, shattering it and knocking the revolver from his grip. He\nwas overwhelmed with astonishment. Why, after the shooting began he\nhad not so much as seen Delaney with any degree of plainness. The whole\naffair was a whirl.\n\n“Well, where did YOU learn to shoot THAT way?” some one in the crowd\ndemanded. Annixter moved his shoulders with a gesture of vast unconcern.\n\n“Oh,” he observed carelessly, “it's not my SHOOTING that ever worried\nME, m'son.”\n\nThe crowd gaped with delight. There was a great wagging of heads.\n\n“Well, I guess not.”\n\n“No, sir, not much.”\n\n“Ah, no, you bet not.”\n\nWhen the women pressed around him, shaking his hands, declaring that\nhe had saved their daughters' lives, Annixter assumed a pose of superb\ndeprecation, the modest self-obliteration of the chevalier. He delivered\nhimself of a remembered phrase, very elegant, refined. It was Lancelot\nafter the tournament, Bayard receiving felicitations after the battle.\n\n“Oh, don't say anything about it,” he murmured. “I only did what any man\nwould have done in my place.”\n\nTo restore completely the equanimity of the company, he announced\nsupper. This he had calculated as a tremendous surprise. It was to have\nbeen served at mid-night, but the irruption of Delaney had dislocated\nthe order of events, and the tables were brought in an hour ahead of\ntime. They were arranged around three sides of the barn and were loaded\ndown with cold roasts of beef, cold chickens and cold ducks, mountains\nof sandwiches, pitchers of milk and lemonade, entire cheeses, bowls\nof olives, plates of oranges and nuts. The advent of this supper was\nreceived with a volley of applause. The musicians played a quick step.\nThe company threw themselves upon the food with a great scraping of\nchairs and a vast rustle of muslins, tarletans, and organdies; soon\nthe clatter of dishes was a veritable uproar. The tables were taken by\nassault. One ate whatever was nearest at hand, some even beginning with\noranges and nuts and ending with beef and chicken. At the end the paper\ncaps were brought on, together with the ice cream. All up and down the\ntables the pulled “crackers” snapped continually like the discharge of\ninnumerable tiny rifles.\n\nThe caps of tissue paper were put on--“Phrygian Bonnets,” “Magicians'\nCaps,” “Liberty Caps;” the young girls looked across the table at their\nvis-a-vis with bursts of laughter and vigorous clapping of the hands.\n\nThe harness room crowd had a table to themselves, at the head of which\nsat Annixter and at the foot Harran. The gun fight had sobered\nPresley thoroughly. He sat by the side of Vanamee, who ate but little,\npreferring rather to watch the scene with calm observation, a little\ncontemptuous when the uproar around the table was too boisterous,\nsavouring of intoxication. Osterman rolled bullets of bread and shot\nthem with astonishing force up and down the table, but the others--Dyke,\nold Broderson, Caraher, Harran Derrick, Hooven, Cutter, Garnett of the\nRuby rancho, Keast from the ranch of the same name, Gethings of the San\nPablo, and Chattern of the Bonanza--occupied themselves with eating as\nmuch as they could before the supper gave out. At a corner of the table,\nspeechless, unobserved, ignored, sat Dabney, of whom nothing was known\nbut his name, the silent old man who made no friends. He ate and drank\nquietly, dipping his sandwich in his lemonade.\n\nOsterman ate all the olives he could lay his hands on, a score of them,\nfifty of them, a hundred of them. He touched no crumb of anything else.\nOld Broderson stared at him, his jaw fallen. Osterman declared he had\nonce eaten a thousand on a bet. The men called each others' attention to\nhim. Delighted to create a sensation, Osterman persevered. The contents\nof an entire bowl disappeared in his huge, reptilian slit of a mouth.\nHis cheeks of brownish red were extended, his bald forehead glistened.\nColics seized upon him. His stomach revolted. It was all one with him.\nHe was satisfied, contented. He was astonishing the people.\n\n“Once I swallowed a tree toad.” he told old Broderson, “by mistake.\nI was eating grapes, and the beggar lived in me three weeks. In rainy\nweather he would sing. You don't believe that,” he vociferated. “Haven't\nI got the toad at home now in a bottle of alcohol.”\n\nAnd the old man, never doubting, his eyes starting, wagged his head in\namazement.\n\n“Oh, yes,” cried Caraher, the length of the table, “that's a pretty good\none. Tell us another.”\n\n“That reminds me of a story,” hazarded old Broderson uncertainly; “once\nwhen I was a lad in Ukiah, fifty years.”\n\n“Oh, yes,” cried half a dozen voices, “THAT'S a pretty good one. Tell us\nanother.”\n\n“Eh--wh--what?” murmured Broderson, looking about him. “I--I don't know.\nIt was Ukiah. You--you--you mix me all up.”\n\nAs soon as supper was over, the floor was cleared again. The guests\nclamoured for a Virginia reel. The last quarter of the evening, the time\nof the most riotous fun, was beginning. The young men caught the\ngirls who sat next to them. The orchestra dashed off into a rollicking\nmovement. The two lines were formed. In a second of time the dance\nwas under way again; the guests still wearing the Phrygian bonnets and\nliberty caps of pink and blue tissue paper.\n\nBut the group of men once more adjourned to the harness room. Fresh\nboxes of cigars were opened; the seventh bowl of fertiliser was mixed.\nOsterman poured the dregs of a glass of it upon his bald head, declaring\nthat he could feel the hair beginning to grow.\n\nBut suddenly old Broderson rose to his feet.\n\n“Aha,” he cackled, “I'M going to have a dance, I am. Think I'm too\nold? I'll show you young fellows. I'm a regular old ROOSTER when I get\nstarted.”\n\nHe marched out into the barn, the others following, holding their sides.\nHe found an aged Mexican woman by the door and hustled her, all confused\nand giggling, into the Virginia reel, then at its height. Every one\ncrowded around to see. Old Broderson stepped off with the alacrity of a\ncolt, snapping his fingers, slapping his thigh, his mouth widening in\nan excited grin. The entire company of the guests shouted. The City Band\nredoubled their efforts; and the old man, losing his head, breathless,\ngasping, dislocated his stiff joints in his efforts. He became\npossessed, bowing, scraping, advancing, retreating, wagging his beard,\ncutting pigeons' wings, distraught with the music, the clamour, the\napplause, the effects of the fertiliser.\n\nAnnixter shouted:\n\n“Nice eye, Santa Claus.”\n\nBut Annixter's attention wandered. He searched for Hilma Tree, having\nstill in mind the look in her eyes at that swift moment of danger. He\nhad not seen her since then. At last he caught sight of her. She was not\ndancing, but, instead, was sitting with her “partner” at the end of the\nbarn near her father and mother, her eyes wide, a serious expression on\nher face, her thoughts, no doubt, elsewhere. Annixter was about to go to\nher when he was interrupted by a cry.\n\nOld Broderson, in the midst of a double shuffle, had clapped his hand\nto his side with a gasp, which he followed by a whoop of anguish. He\nhad got a stitch or had started a twinge somewhere. With a gesture\nof resignation, he drew himself laboriously out of the dance, limping\nabominably, one leg dragging. He was heard asking for his wife. Old Mrs.\nBroderson took him in charge. She jawed him for making an exhibition of\nhimself, scolding as though he were a ten-year-old.\n\n“Well, I want to know!” she exclaimed, as he hobbled off, dejected and\nmelancholy, leaning upon her arm, “thought he had to dance, indeed! What\nnext? A gay old grandpa, this. He'd better be thinking of his coffin.”\n\nIt was almost midnight. The dance drew towards its close in a storm\nof jubilation. The perspiring musicians toiled like galley slaves; the\nguests singing as they danced.\n\nThe group of men reassembled in the harness room. Even Magnus Derrick\ncondescended to enter and drink a toast. Presley and Vanamee, still\nholding themselves aloof, looked on, Vanamee more and more disgusted.\nDabney, standing to one side, overlooked and forgotten, continued to\nsip steadily at his glass, solemn, reserved. Garnett of the Ruby rancho,\nKeast from the ranch of the same name, Gethings of the San Pablo, and\nChattern of the Bonanza, leaned back in their chairs, their waist-coats\nunbuttoned, their legs spread wide, laughing--they could not tell why.\nOther ranchers, men whom Annixter had never seen, appeared in the room,\nwheat growers from places as far distant as Goshen and Pixley; young men\nand old, proprietors of veritable principalities, hundreds of thousands\nof acres of wheat lands, a dozen of them, a score of them; men who were\nstrangers to each other, but who made it a point to shake hands with\nMagnus Derrick, the “prominent man” of the valley. Old Broderson, whom\nevery one had believed had gone home, returned, though much sobered, and\ntook his place, refusing, however, to drink another spoonful.\n\nSoon the entire number of Annixter's guests found themselves in two\ncompanies, the dancers on the floor of the barn, frolicking through the\nlast figures of the Virginia reel and the boisterous gathering of men in\nthe harness room, downing the last quarts of fertiliser. Both assemblies\nhad been increased. Even the older people had joined in the dance, while\nnearly every one of the men who did not dance had found their way into\nthe harness room. The two groups rivalled each other in their noise. Out\non the floor of the barn was a very whirlwind of gayety, a tempest of\nlaughter, hand-clapping and cries of amusement. In the harness room\nthe confused shouting and singing, the stamping of heavy feet, set a\nquivering reverberation in the oil of the kerosene lamps, the flame of\nthe candles in the Japanese lanterns flaring and swaying in the gusts\nof hilarity. At intervals, between the two, one heard the music, the\nwailing of the violins, the vigorous snarling of the cornet, and the\nharsh, incessant rasping of the snare drum.\n\nAnd at times all these various sounds mingled in a single vague\nnote, huge, clamorous, that rose up into the night from the colossal,\nreverberating compass of the barn and sent its echoes far off across the\nunbroken levels of the surrounding ranches, stretching out to infinity\nunder the clouded sky, calm, mysterious, still.\n\nAnnixter, the punch bowl clasped in his arms, was pouring out the last\nspoonful of liquor into Caraher's glass when he was aware that some one\nwas pulling at the sleeve of his coat. He set down the punch bowl.\n\n“Well, where did YOU come from?” he demanded.\n\nIt was a messenger from Bonneville, the uniformed boy that the telephone\ncompany employed to carry messages. He had just arrived from town on his\nbicycle, out of breath and panting.\n\n“Message for you, sir. Will you sign?”\n\nHe held the book to Annixter, who signed the receipt, wondering.\n\nThe boy departed, leaving a thick envelope of yellow paper in Annixter's\nhands, the address typewritten, the word “Urgent” written in blue pencil\nin one corner.\n\nAnnixter tore it open. The envelope contained other sealed envelopes,\nsome eight or ten of them, addressed to Magnus Derrick, Osterman,\nBroderson, Garnett, Keast, Gethings, Chattern, Dabney, and to Annixter\nhimself.\n\nStill puzzled, Annixter distributed the envelopes, muttering to himself:\n\n“What's up now?”\n\nThe incident had attracted attention. A comparative quiet followed, the\nguests following the letters with their eyes as they were passed around\nthe table. They fancied that Annixter had arranged a surprise.\n\nMagnus Derrick, who sat next to Annixter, was the first to receive his\nletter. With a word of excuse he opened it.\n\n“Read it, read it, Governor,” shouted a half-dozen voices. “No secrets,\nyou know. Everything above board here to-night.”\n\nMagnus cast a glance at the contents of the letter, then rose to his\nfeet and read:\n\n\n     Magnus Derrick,\n         Bonneville, Tulare Co., Cal.\n\n\n     Dear Sir:\n\n     By regrade of October 1st, the value of the railroad land you\n     occupy, included in your ranch of Los Muertos, has been fixed at\n     $27.00 per acre.  The land is now for sale at that price to any\n     one.\n\n                           Yours, etc.,\n                   CYRUS BLAKELEE RUGGLES,\n                           Land Agent, P. and S. W. R. R.\n\n                   S. BEHRMAN,\n                           Local Agent, P. and S. W. R. R.\n\nIn the midst of the profound silence that followed, Osterman was heard\nto exclaim grimly:\n\n“THAT'S a pretty good one. Tell us another.”\n\nBut for a long moment this was the only remark.\n\nThe silence widened, broken only by the sound of torn paper as Annixter,\nOsterman, old Broderson, Garnett, Keast, Gethings, Chattern, and Dabney\nopened and read their letters. They were all to the same effect, almost\nword for word like the Governor's. Only the figures and the proper names\nvaried. In some cases the price per acre was twenty-two dollars. In\nAnnixter's case it was thirty.\n\n“And--and the company promised to sell to me, to--to all of us,” gasped\nold Broderson, “at TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF an acre.”\n\nIt was not alone the ranchers immediately around Bonneville who would\nbe plundered by this move on the part of the Railroad. The “alternate\nsection” system applied throughout all the San Joaquin. By striking at\nthe Bonneville ranchers a terrible precedent was established. Of\nthe crowd of guests in the harness room alone, nearly every man was\naffected, every man menaced with ruin. All of a million acres was\nsuddenly involved.\n\nThen suddenly the tempest burst. A dozen men were on their feet in an\ninstant, their teeth set, their fists clenched, their faces purple with\nrage. Oaths, curses, maledictions exploded like the firing of successive\nmines. Voices quivered with wrath, hands flung upward, the fingers\nhooked, prehensile, trembled with anger. The sense of wrongs, the\ninjustices, the oppression, extortion, and pillage of twenty years\nsuddenly culminated and found voice in a raucous howl of execration.\nFor a second there was nothing articulate in that cry of savage\nexasperation, nothing even intelligent. It was the human animal hounded\nto its corner, exploited, harried to its last stand, at bay, ferocious,\nterrible, turning at last with bared teeth and upraised claws to meet\nthe death grapple. It was the hideous squealing of the tormented brute,\nits back to the wall, defending its lair, its mate and its whelps, ready\nto bite, to rend, to trample, to batter out the life of The Enemy in a\nprimeval, bestial welter of blood and fury.\n\nThe roar subsided to intermittent clamour, in the pauses of which the\nsounds of music and dancing made themselves audible once more.\n\n“S. Behrman again,” vociferated Harran Derrick.\n\n“Chose his moment well,” muttered Annixter. “Hits his hardest when we're\nall rounded up having a good time.”\n\n“Gentlemen, this is ruin.”\n\n“What's to be done now?”\n\n“FIGHT! My God! do you think we are going to stand this? Do you think we\nCAN?”\n\nThe uproar swelled again. The clearer the assembly of ranchers\nunderstood the significance of this move on the part of the Railroad,\nthe more terrible it appeared, the more flagrant, the more intolerable.\nWas it possible, was it within the bounds of imagination that this\ntyranny should be contemplated? But they knew--past years had driven\nhome the lesson--the implacable, iron monster with whom they had to\ndeal, and again and again the sense of outrage and oppression lashed\nthem to their feet, their mouths wide with curses, their fists clenched\ntight, their throats hoarse with shouting.\n\n“Fight! How fight? What ARE you going to do?”\n\n“If there's a law in this land”\n\n“If there is, it is in Shelgrim's pocket. Who owns the courts in\nCalifornia? Ain't it Shelgrim?”\n\n“God damn him.”\n\n“Well, how long are you going to stand it? How long before you'll settle\nup accounts with six inches of plugged gas-pipe?”\n\n“And our contracts, the solemn pledges of the corporation to sell to us\nfirst of all----”\n\n“And now the land is for sale to anybody.”\n\n“Why, it is a question of my home. Am I to be turned out? Why, I have\nput eight thousand dollars into improving this land.”\n\n“And I six thousand, and now that I have, the Railroad grabs it.”\n\n“And the system of irrigating ditches that Derrick and I have been\nlaying out. There's thousands of dollars in that!”\n\n“I'll fight this out till I've spent every cent of my money.”\n\n“Where? In the courts that the company owns?”\n\n“Think I am going to give in to this? Think I am to get off my land? By\nGod, gentlemen, law or no law, railroad or no railroad, I--WILL--NOT.”\n\n“Nor I.”\n\n“Nor I.”\n\n“Nor I.”\n\n“This is the last. Legal means first; if those fail--the shotgun.”\n\n“They can kill me. They can shoot me down, but I'll die--die fighting\nfor my home--before I'll give in to this.”\n\nAt length Annixter made himself heard:\n\n“All out of the room but the ranch owners,” he shouted. “Hooven,\nCaraher, Dyke, you'll have to clear out. This is a family affair.\nPresley, you and your friend can remain.”\n\nReluctantly the others filed through the door. There remained in the\nharness room--besides Vanamee and Presley--Magnus Derrick, Annixter, old\nBroderson Harran, Garnett from the Ruby rancho, Keast from the ranch of\nthe same name, Gethings of the San Pablo, Chattern of the Bonanza, about\na score of others, ranchers from various parts of the county, and, last\nof all, Dabney, ignored, silent, to whom nobody spoke and who, as yet,\nhad not uttered a word. But the men who had been asked to leave the\nharness room spread the news throughout the barn. It was repeated from\nlip to lip. One by one the guests dropped out of the dance. Groups were\nformed. By swift degrees the gayety lapsed away. The Virginia reel\nbroke up. The musicians ceased playing, and in the place of the noisy,\neffervescent revelry of the previous half hour, a subdued murmur filled\nall the barn, a mingling of whispers, lowered voices, the coming and\ngoing of light footsteps, the uneasy shifting of positions, while from\nbehind the closed doors of the harness room came a prolonged, sullen\nhum of anger and strenuous debate. The dance came to an abrupt end.\nThe guests, unwilling to go as yet, stunned, distressed, stood clumsily\nabout, their eyes vague, their hands swinging at their sides, looking\nstupidly into each others' faces. A sense of impending calamity,\noppressive, foreboding, gloomy, passed through the air overhead in the\nnight, a long shiver of anguish and of terror, mysterious, despairing.\n\nIn the harness room, however, the excitement continued unchecked. One\nrancher after another delivered himself of a torrent of furious words.\nThere was no order, merely the frenzied outcry of blind fury. One spirit\nalone was common to all--resistance at whatever cost and to whatever\nlengths.\n\nSuddenly Osterman leaped to his feet, his bald head gleaming in the\nlamp-light, his red ears distended, a flood of words filling his great,\nhorizontal slit of a mouth, his comic actor's face flaming. Like the\nhero of a melodrama, he took stage with a great sweeping gesture.\n\n“ORGANISATION,” he shouted, “that must be our watch-word. The curse\nof the ranchers is that they fritter away their strength. Now, we must\nstand together, now, NOW. Here's the crisis, here's the moment. Shall we\nmeet it? I CALL FOR THE LEAGUE. Not next week, not to-morrow, not in the\nmorning, but now, now, now, this very moment, before we go out of that\ndoor. Every one of us here to join it, to form the beginnings of a vast\norganisation, banded together to death, if needs be, for the protection\nof our rights and homes. Are you ready? Is it now or never? I call for\nthe League.”\n\nInstantly there was a shout. With an actor's instinct, Osterman had\nspoken at the precise psychological moment. He carried the others off\ntheir feet, glib, dexterous, voluble. Just what was meant by the League\nthe others did not know, but it was something, a vague engine, a machine\nwith which to fight. Osterman had not done speaking before the room rang\nwith outcries, the crowd of men shouting, for what they did not know.\n\n“The League! The League!”\n\n“Now, to-night, this moment; sign our names before we leave.”\n\n“He's right. Organisation! The League!”\n\n“We have a committee at work already,” Osterman vociferated. “I am a\nmember, and also Mr. Broderson, Mr. Annixter, and Mr. Harran Derrick.\nWhat our aims are we will explain to you later. Let this committee\nbe the nucleus of the League--temporarily, at least. Trust us. We are\nworking for you and with you. Let this committee be merged into the\nlarger committee of the League, and for President of the League”--he\npaused the fraction of a second--“for President there can be but one\nname mentioned, one man to whom we all must look as leader--Magnus\nDerrick.”\n\nThe Governor's name was received with a storm of cheers. The harness\nroom reechoed with shouts of:\n\n“Derrick! Derrick!”\n\n“Magnus for President!”\n\n“Derrick, our natural leader.”\n\n“Derrick, Derrick, Derrick for President.”\n\nMagnus rose to his feet. He made no gesture. Erect as a cavalry officer,\ntall, thin, commanding, he dominated the crowd in an instant. There was\na moment's hush. “Gentlemen,” he said, “if organisation is a good word,\nmoderation is a better one. The matter is too grave for haste. I would\nsuggest that we each and severally return to our respective homes for\nthe night, sleep over what has happened, and convene again to-morrow,\nwhen we are calmer and can approach this affair in a more judicious\nmood. As for the honour with which you would inform me, I must affirm\nthat that, too, is a matter for grave deliberation. This League is but\na name as yet. To accept control of an organisation whose principles are\nnot yet fixed is a heavy responsibility. I shrink from it--”\n\nBut he was allowed to proceed no farther. A storm of protest developed.\nThere were shouts of:\n\n“No, no. The League to-night and Derrick for President.”\n\n“We have been moderate too long.”\n\n“The League first, principles afterward.”\n\n“We can't wait,” declared Osterman. “Many of us cannot attend a meeting\nto-morrow. Our business affairs would prevent it. Now we are all\ntogether. I propose a temporary chairman and secretary be named and\na ballot be taken. But first the League. Let us draw up a set of\nresolutions to stand together, for the defence of our homes, to death,\nif needs be, and each man present affix his signature thereto.”\n\nHe subsided amidst vigorous applause. The next quarter of an hour was\na vague confusion, every one talking at once, conversations going on\nin low tones in various corners of the room. Ink, pens, and a sheaf of\nfoolscap were brought from the ranch house. A set of resolutions was\ndraughted, having the force of a pledge, organising the League of\nDefence. Annixter was the first to sign. Others followed, only a few\nholding back, refusing to join till they had thought the matter over.\nThe roll grew; the paper circulated about the table; each signature was\nwelcomed by a salvo of cheers. At length, it reached Harran Derrick, who\nsigned amid tremendous uproar. He released the pen only to shake a score\nof hands.\n\n“Now, Magnus Derrick.”\n\n“Gentlemen,” began the Governor, once more rising, “I beg of you to\nallow me further consideration. Gentlemen--”\n\nHe was interrupted by renewed shouting.\n\n“No, no, now or never. Sign, join the League.”\n\n“Don't leave us. We look to you to help.”\n\nBut presently the excited throng that turned their faces towards the\nGovernor were aware of a new face at his elbow. The door of the harness\nroom had been left unbolted and Mrs. Derrick, unable to endure the\nheart-breaking suspense of waiting outside, had gathered up all her\ncourage and had come into the room. Trembling, she clung to Magnus's\narm, her pretty light-brown hair in disarray, her large young girl's\neyes wide with terror and distrust. What was about to happen she did not\nunderstand, but these men were clamouring for Magnus to pledge himself\nto something, to some terrible course of action, some ruthless,\nunscrupulous battle to the death with the iron-hearted monster of\nsteel and steam. Nerved with a coward's intrepidity, she, who so easily\nobliterated herself, had found her way into the midst of this frantic\ncrowd, into this hot, close room, reeking of alcohol and tobacco smoke,\ninto this atmosphere surcharged with hatred and curses. She seized her\nhusband's arm imploring, distraught with terror.\n\n“No, no,” she murmured; “no, don't sign.”\n\nShe was the feather caught in the whirlwind. En masse, the crowd surged\ntoward the erect figure of the Governor, the pen in one hand, his wife's\nfingers in the other, the roll of signatures before him. The clamour\nwas deafening; the excitement culminated brusquely. Half a hundred\nhands stretched toward him; thirty voices, at top pitch, implored,\nexpostulated, urged, almost commanded. The reverberation of the shouting\nwas as the plunge of a cataract.\n\nIt was the uprising of The People; the thunder of the outbreak of\nrevolt; the mob demanding to be led, aroused at last, imperious,\nresistless, overwhelming. It was the blind fury of insurrection, the\nbrute, many-tongued, red-eyed, bellowing for guidance, baring its teeth,\nunsheathing its claws, imposing its will with the abrupt, resistless\npressure of the relaxed piston, inexorable, knowing no pity.\n\n“No, no,” implored Annie Derrick. “No, Magnus, don't sign.”\n\n“He must,” declared Harran, shouting in her ear to make himself heard,\n“he must. Don't you understand?”\n\nAgain the crowd surged forward, roaring. Mrs. Derrick was swept back,\npushed to one side. Her husband no longer belonged to her. She paid the\npenalty for being the wife of a great man. The world, like a colossal\niron wedge, crushed itself between. She was thrust to the wall. The\nthrong of men, stamping, surrounded Magnus; she could no longer see him,\nbut, terror-struck, she listened. There was a moment's lull, then a vast\nthunder of savage jubilation. Magnus had signed.\n\nHarran found his mother leaning against the wall, her hands shut over\nher ears; her eyes, dilated with fear, brimming with tears. He led her\nfrom the harness room to the outer room, where Mrs. Tree and Hilma took\ncharge of her, and then, impatient, refusing to answer the hundreds of\nanxious questions that assailed him, hurried back to the harness room.\nAlready the balloting was in progress, Osterman acting as temporary\nchairman on the very first ballot he was made secretary of the League\npro tem., and Magnus unanimously chosen for its President. An executive\ncommittee was formed, which was to meet the next day at the Los Muertos\nranch house.\n\nIt was half-past one o'clock. In the barn outside the greater number of\nthe guests had departed. Long since the musicians had disappeared. There\nonly remained the families of the ranch owners involved in the meeting\nin the harness room. These huddled in isolated groups in corners of the\ngarish, echoing barn, the women in their wraps, the young men with\ntheir coat collars turned up against the draughts that once more made\nthemselves felt.\n\nFor a long half hour the loud hum of eager conversation continued to\nissue from behind the door of the harness room. Then, at length, there\nwas a prolonged scraping of chairs. The session was over. The men came\nout in groups, searching for their families.\n\nAt once the homeward movement began. Every one was worn out. Some of the\nranchers' daughters had gone to sleep against their mothers' shoulders.\n\nBilly, the stableman, and his assistant were awakened, and the teams\nwere hitched up. The stable yard was full of a maze of swinging lanterns\nand buggy lamps. The horses fretted, champing the bits; the carry-alls\ncreaked with the straining of leather and springs as they received their\nloads. At every instant one heard the rattle of wheels as vehicle after\nvehicle disappeared in the night.\n\nA fine, drizzling rain was falling, and the lamps began to show dim in a\nvague haze of orange light.\n\nMagnus Derrick was the last to go. At the doorway of the barn he found\nAnnixter, the roll of names--which it had been decided he was to keep\nin his safe for the moment--under his arm. Silently the two shook hands.\nMagnus departed. The grind of the wheels of his carry-all grated sharply\non the gravel of the driveway in front of the ranch house, then, with\na hollow roll across a little plank bridge, gained the roadway. For a\nmoment the beat of the horses' hoofs made itself heard on the roadway.\nIt ceased. Suddenly there was a great silence.\n\nAnnixter, in the doorway of the great barn, stood looking about him\nfor a moment, alone, thoughtful. The barn was empty. That astonishing\nevening had come to an end. The whirl of things and people, the crowd\nof dancers, Delaney, the gun fight, Hilma Tree, her eyes fixed on him\nin mute confession, the rabble in the harness room, the news of the\nregrade, the fierce outburst of wrath, the hasty organising of the\nLeague, all went spinning confusedly through his recollection. But he\nwas exhausted. Time enough in the morning to think it all over. By now\nit was raining sharply. He put the roll of names into his inside pocket,\nthrew a sack over his head and shoulders, and went down to the ranch\nhouse.\n\nBut in the harness room, lighted by the glittering lanterns and flaring\nlamps, in the midst of overturned chairs, spilled liquor, cigar stumps,\nand broken glasses, Vanamee and Presley still remained talking, talking.\nAt length, they rose, and came out upon the floor of the barn and stood\nfor a moment looking about them.\n\nBilly, the stableman, was going the rounds of the walls, putting out\nlight after light. By degrees, the vast interior was growing dim. Upon\nthe roof overhead the rain drummed incessantly, the eaves dripping.\nThe floor was littered with pine needles, bits of orange peel, ends and\nfragments of torn organdies and muslins and bits of tissue paper from\nthe “Phrygian Bonnets” and “Liberty Caps.” The buckskin mare in the\nstall, dozing on three legs, changed position with a long sigh. The\nsweat stiffening the hair upon her back and loins, as it dried, gave off\na penetrating, ammoniacal odour that mingled with the stale perfume of\nsachet and wilted flowers.\n\nPresley and Vanamee stood looking at the deserted barn. There was a long\nsilence. Then Presley said:\n\n“Well... what do you think of it all?”\n\n“I think,” answered Vanamee slowly, “I think that there was a dance in\nBrussels the night before Waterloo.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nIn his office at San Francisco, seated before a massive desk of polished\nredwood, very ornate, Lyman Derrick sat dictating letters to his\ntypewriter, on a certain morning early in the spring of the year.\nThe subdued monotone of his voice proceeded evenly from sentence to\nsentence, regular, precise, businesslike.\n\n“I have the honour to acknowledge herewith your favour of the 14th\ninstant, and in reply would state----”\n\n“Please find enclosed draft upon New Orleans to be applied as per our\nunderstanding----”\n\n“In answer to your favour No. 1107, referring to the case of the City\nand County of San Francisco against Excelsior Warehouse & Storage Co., I\nwould say----”\n\nHis voice continued, expressionless, measured, distinct. While he spoke,\nhe swung slowly back and forth in his leather swivel chair, his elbows\nresting on the arms, his pop eyes fixed vaguely upon the calendar on\nthe opposite wall, winking at intervals when he paused, searching for a\nword.\n\n“That's all for the present,” he said at length.\n\nWithout reply, the typewriter rose and withdrew, thrusting her pencil\ninto the coil of her hair, closing the door behind her, softly,\ndiscreetly.\n\nWhen she had gone, Lyman rose, stretching himself putting up three\nfingers to hide his yawn. To further loosen his muscles, he took a\ncouple of turns the length of he room, noting with satisfaction its fine\nappointments, the padded red carpet, the dull olive green tint of the\nwalls, the few choice engravings--portraits of Marshall, Taney, Field,\nand a coloured lithograph--excellently done--of the Grand Canyon of the\nColorado--the deep-seated leather chairs, the large and crowded bookcase\n(topped with a bust of James Lick, and a huge greenish globe), the waste\nbasket of woven coloured grass, made by Navajo Indians, the massive\nsilver inkstand on the desk, the elaborate filing cabinet, complete in\nevery particular, and the shelves of tin boxes, padlocked, impressive,\ngrave, bearing the names of clients, cases and estates.\n\nHe was between thirty-one and thirty-five years of age. Unlike Harran,\nhe resembled his mother, but he was much darker than Annie Derrick\nand his eyes were much fuller, the eyeball protruding, giving him a\npop-eyed, foreign expression, quite unusual and unexpected. His hair was\nblack, and he wore a small, tight, pointed mustache, which he was in the\nhabit of pushing delicately upward from the corners of his lips with the\nball of his thumb, the little finger extended. As often as he made this\ngesture, he prefaced it with a little twisting gesture of the forearm in\norder to bring his cuff into view, and, in fact, this movement by itself\nwas habitual.\n\nHe was dressed carefully, his trousers creased, a pink rose in his\nlapel. His shoes were of patent leather, his cutaway coat was of very\nrough black cheviot, his double-breasted waistcoat of tan covered cloth\nwith buttons of smoked pearl. An Ascot scarf--a great puff of heavy\nblack silk--was at his neck, the knot transfixed by a tiny golden pin\nset off with an opal and four small diamonds.\n\nAt one end of the room were two great windows of plate glass, and\npausing at length before one of these, Lyman selected a cigarette from\nhis curved box of oxydized silver, lit it and stood looking down and\nout, willing to be idle for a moment, amused and interested in the view.\n\nHis office was on the tenth floor of the EXCHANGE BUILDING, a beautiful,\ntower-like affair of white stone, that stood on the corner of Market\nStreet near its intersection with Kearney, the most imposing office\nbuilding of the city.\n\nBelow him the city swarmed tumultuous through its grooves, the\ncable-cars starting and stopping with a gay jangling of bells and a\nstrident whirring of jostled glass windows. Drays and carts clattered\nover the cobbles, and an incessant shuffling of thousands of feet rose\nfrom the pavement. Around Lotta's fountain the baskets of the flower\nsellers, crammed with chrysanthemums, violets, pinks, roses, lilies,\nhyacinths, set a brisk note of colour in the grey of the street.\n\nBut to Lyman's notion the general impression of this centre of the\ncity's life was not one of strenuous business activity. It was a\ncontinuous interest in small things, a people ever willing to be amused\nat trifles, refusing to consider serious matters--good-natured,\nallowing themselves to be imposed upon, taking life easily--generous,\ncompanionable, enthusiastic; living, as it were, from day to day, in a\nplace where the luxuries of life were had without effort; in a city that\noffered to consideration the restlessness of a New York, without its\nearnestness; the serenity of a Naples, without its languor; the romance\nof a Seville, without its picturesqueness.\n\nAs Lyman turned from the window, about to resume his work, the office\nboy appeared at the door.\n\n“The man from the lithograph company, sir,” announced the boy.\n\n“Well, what does he want?” demanded Lyman, adding, however, upon the\ninstant: “Show him in.”\n\nA young man entered, carrying a great bundle, which he deposited on a\nchair, with a gasp of relief, exclaiming, all out of breath:\n\n“From the Standard Lithograph Company.”\n\n“What is?”\n\n“Don't know,” replied the other. “Maps, I guess.”\n\n“I don't want any maps. Who sent them? I guess you're mistaken.” Lyman\ntore the cover from the top of the package, drawing out one of a great\nmany huge sheets of white paper, folded eight times. Suddenly, he\nuttered an exclamation:\n\n“Ah, I see. They ARE maps. But these should not have come here. They are\nto go to the regular office for distribution.” He wrote a new direction\non the label of the package: “Take them to that address,” he went on.\n“I'll keep this one here. The others go to that address. If you see Mr.\nDarrell, tell him that Mr. Derrick--you get the name--Mr. Derrick may\nnot be able to get around this afternoon, but to go ahead with any\nbusiness just the same.”\n\nThe young man departed with the package and Lyman, spreading out the map\nupon the table, remained for some time studying it thoughtfully.\n\nIt was a commissioner's official railway map of the State of California,\ncompleted to March 30th of that year. Upon it the different railways\nof the State were accurately plotted in various colours, blue, green,\nyellow. However, the blue, the yellow, and the green were but brief\ntraceries, very short, isolated, unimportant. At a little distance\nthese could hardly be seen. The whole map was gridironed by a vast,\ncomplicated network of red lines marked P. and S. W. R. R. These\ncentralised at San Francisco and thence ramified and spread north, east,\nand south, to every quarter of the State. From Coles, in the topmost\ncorner of the map, to Yuma in the lowest, from Reno on one side to San\nFrancisco on the other, ran the plexus of red, a veritable system of\nblood circulation, complicated, dividing, and reuniting, branching,\nsplitting, extending, throwing out feelers, off-shoots, tap roots,\nfeeders--diminutive little blood suckers that shot out from the main\njugular and went twisting up into some remote county, laying hold\nupon some forgotten village or town, involving it in one of a myriad\nbranching coils, one of a hundred tentacles, drawing it, as it were,\ntoward that centre from which all this system sprang.\n\nThe map was white, and it seemed as if all the colour which should have\ngone to vivify the various counties, towns, and cities marked upon\nit had been absorbed by that huge, sprawling organism, with its ruddy\narteries converging to a central point. It was as though the State had\nbeen sucked white and colourless, and against this pallid background the\nred arteries of the monster stood out, swollen with life-blood, reaching\nout to infinity, gorged to bursting; an excrescence, a gigantic parasite\nfattening upon the life-blood of an entire commonwealth.\n\nHowever, in an upper corner of the map appeared the names of the three\nnew commissioners: Jones McNish for the first district, Lyman Derrick\nfor the second, and James Darrell for the third.\n\nNominated in the Democratic State convention in the fall of the\npreceding year, Lyman, backed by the coteries of San Francisco bosses\nin the pay of his father's political committee of ranchers, had been\nelected together with Darrell, the candidate of the Pueblo and Mojave\nroad, and McNish, the avowed candidate of the Pacific and Southwestern.\nDarrell was rabidly against the P. and S. W., McNish rabidly for it.\nLyman was supposed to be the conservative member of the board, the\nranchers' candidate, it was true, and faithful to their interests, but\na calm man, deliberative, swayed by no such violent emotions as his\ncolleagues.\n\nOsterman's dexterity had at last succeeded in entangling Magnus\ninextricably in the new politics. The famous League, organised in\nthe heat of passion the night of Annixter's barn dance, had been\nconsolidated all through the winter months. Its executive committee, of\nwhich Magnus was chairman, had been, through Osterman's manipulation,\nmerged into the old committee composed of Broderson, Annixter, and\nhimself. Promptly thereat he had resigned the chairmanship of this\ncommittee, thus leaving Magnus at its head. Precisely as Osterman had\nplanned, Magnus was now one of them. The new committee accordingly had\ntwo objects in view: to resist the attempted grabbing of their lands by\nthe Railroad, and to push forward their own secret scheme of electing a\nboard of railroad commissioners who should regulate wheat rates so as\nto favour the ranchers of the San Joaquin. The land cases were promptly\ntaken to the courts and the new grading--fixing the price of the lands\nat twenty and thirty dollars an acre instead of two--bitterly and\nstubbornly fought. But delays occurred, the process of the law was\ninterminable, and in the intervals the committee addressed itself to the\nwork of seating the “Ranchers' Commission,” as the projected Board of\nCommissioners came to be called.\n\nIt was Harran who first suggested that his brother, Lyman, be put\nforward as the candidate for this district. At once the proposition had\na great success. Lyman seemed made for the place. While allied by every\ntie of blood to the ranching interests, he had never been identified\nwith them. He was city-bred. The Railroad would not be over-suspicious\nof him. He was a good lawyer, a good business man, keen, clear-headed,\nfar-sighted, had already some practical knowledge of politics, having\nserved a term as assistant district attorney, and even at the present\nmoment occupying the position of sheriff's attorney. More than all, he\nwas the son of Magnus Derrick; he could be relied upon, could be trusted\nimplicitly to remain loyal to the ranchers' cause.\n\nThe campaign for Railroad Commissioner had been very interesting. At\nthe very outset Magnus's committee found itself involved in corrupt\npolitics. The primaries had to be captured at all costs and by any\nmeans, and when the convention assembled it was found necessary to buy\noutright the votes of certain delegates. The campaign fund raised by\ncontributions from Magnus, Annixter, Broderson, and Osterman was drawn\nupon to the extent of five thousand dollars.\n\nOnly the committee knew of this corruption. The League, ignoring\nways and means, supposed as a matter of course that the campaign was\nhonorably conducted.\n\nFor a whole week after the consummation of this part of the deal, Magnus\nhad kept to his house, refusing to be seen, alleging that he was\nill, which was not far from the truth. The shame of the business, the\nloathing of what he had done, were to him things unspeakable. He could\nno longer look Harran in the face. He began a course of deception\nwith his wife. More than once, he had resolved to break with the whole\naffair, resigning his position, allowing the others to proceed without\nhim. But now it was too late. He was pledged. He had joined the League.\nHe was its chief, and his defection might mean its disintegration at the\nvery time when it needed all its strength to fight the land cases. More\nthan a mere deal in bad politics was involved. There was the land grab.\nHis withdrawal from an unholy cause would mean the weakening, perhaps\nthe collapse, of another cause that he believed to be righteous as truth\nitself. He was hopelessly caught in the mesh. Wrong seemed indissolubly\nknitted into the texture of Right. He was blinded, dizzied, overwhelmed,\ncaught in the current of events, and hurried along he knew not where. He\nresigned himself.\n\nIn the end, and after much ostentatious opposition on the part of the\nrailroad heelers, Lyman was nominated and subsequently elected.\n\nWhen this consummation was reached Magnus, Osterman, Broderson, and\nAnnixter stared at each other. Their wildest hopes had not dared to fix\nthemselves upon so easy a victory as this. It was not believable that\nthe corporation would allow itself to be fooled so easily, would rush\nopen-eyed into the trap. How had it happened?\n\nOsterman, however, threw his hat into the air with wild whoops of\ndelight. Old Broderson permitted himself a feeble cheer. Even Magnus\nbeamed satisfaction. The other members of the League, present at the\ntime, shook hands all around and spoke of opening a few bottles on the\nstrength of the occasion. Annixter alone was recalcitrant.\n\n“It's too easy,” he declared. “No, I'm not satisfied. Where's Shelgrim\nin all this? Why don't he show his hand, damn his soul? The thing is\nyellow, I tell you. There's a big fish in these waters somewheres. I\ndon't know his name, and I don't know his game, but he's moving round\noff and on, just out of sight. If you think you've netted him, I DON'T,\nthat's all I've got to say.”\n\nBut he was jeered down as a croaker. There was the Commission. He\ncouldn't get around that, could he? There was Darrell and Lyman Derrick,\nboth pledged to the ranches. Good Lord, he was never satisfied. He'd be\nobstinate till the very last gun was fired. Why, if he got drowned in a\nriver he'd float upstream just to be contrary.\n\nIn the course of time, the new board was seated. For the first few\nmonths of its term, it was occupied in clearing up the business left\nover by the old board and in the completion of the railway map. But\nnow, the decks were cleared. It was about to address itself to the\nconsideration of a revision of the tariff for the carriage of grain\nbetween the San Joaquin Valley and tide-water.\n\nBoth Lyman and Darrell were pledged to an average ten per cent. cut of\nthe grain rates throughout the entire State.\n\nThe typewriter returned with the letters for Lyman to sign, and he put\naway the map and took up his morning's routine of business, wondering,\nthe while, what would become of his practice during the time he was\ninvolved in the business of the Ranchers' Railroad Commission.\n\nBut towards noon, at the moment when Lyman was drawing off a glass of\nmineral water from the siphon that stood at his elbow, there was an\ninterruption. Some one rapped vigorously upon the door, which was\nimmediately after opened, and Magnus and Harran came in, followed by\nPresley.\n\n“Hello, hello!” cried Lyman, jumping up, extending his hands, “why,\nhere's a surprise. I didn't expect you all till to-night. Come in, come\nin and sit down. Have a glass of sizz-water, Governor.”\n\nThe others explained that they had come up from Bonneville the night\nbefore, as the Executive Committee of the League had received a despatch\nfrom the lawyers it had retained to fight the Railroad, that the judge\nof the court in San Francisco, where the test cases were being tried,\nmight be expected to hand down his decision the next day.\n\nVery soon after the announcement of the new grading of the ranchers'\nlands, the corporation had offered, through S. Behrman, to lease the\ndisputed lands to the ranchers at a nominal figure. The offer had been\nangrily rejected, and the Railroad had put up the lands for sale at\nRuggles's office in Bonneville. At the exorbitant price named, buyers\npromptly appeared--dummy buyers, beyond shadow of doubt, acting either\nfor the Railroad or for S. Behrman--men hitherto unknown in the county,\nmen without property, without money, adventurers, heelers. Prominent\namong them, and bidding for the railroad's holdings included on\nAnnixter's ranch, was Delaney.\n\nThe farce of deeding the corporation's sections to these fictitious\npurchasers was solemnly gone through with at Ruggles's office, the\nRailroad guaranteeing them possession. The League refused to allow the\nsupposed buyers to come upon the land, and the Railroad, faithful to\nits pledge in the matter of guaranteeing its dummies possession, at once\nbegan suits in ejectment in the district court in Visalia, the county\nseat.\n\nIt was the preliminary skirmish, the reconnaisance in force, the\ncombatants feeling each other's strength, willing to proceed with\ncaution, postponing the actual death-grip for a while till each had\nstrengthened its position and organised its forces.\n\nDuring the time the cases were on trial at Visalia, S. Behrman was much\nin evidence in and about the courts. The trial itself, after tedious\npreliminaries, was brief. The ranchers lost. The test cases were\nimmediately carried up to the United States Circuit Court in San\nFrancisco. At the moment the decision of this court was pending.\n\n“Why, this is news,” exclaimed Lyman, in response to the Governor's\nannouncement; “I did not expect them to be so prompt. I was in court\nonly last week and there seemed to be no end of business ahead. I\nsuppose you are very anxious?”\n\nMagnus nodded. He had seated himself in one of Lyman's deep chairs, his\ngrey top-hat, with its wide brim, on the floor beside him. His coat of\nblack broad-cloth that had been tightly packed in his valise, was yet\nwrinkled and creased; his trousers were strapped under his high boots.\nAs he spoke, he stroked the bridge of his hawklike nose with his bent\nforefinger.\n\nLeaning-back in his chair, he watched his two sons with secret delight.\nTo his eye, both were perfect specimens of their class, intelligent,\nwell-looking, resourceful. He was intensely proud of them. He was never\nhappier, never more nearly jovial, never more erect, more military, more\nalert, and buoyant than when in the company of his two sons. He honestly\nbelieved that no finer examples of young manhood existed throughout the\nentire nation.\n\n“I think we should win in this court,” Harran observed, watching the\nbubbles break in his glass. “The investigation has been much more\ncomplete than in the Visalia trial. Our case this time is too good. It\nhas made too much talk. The court would not dare render a decision for\nthe Railroad. Why, there's the agreement in black and white--and the\ncirculars the Railroad issued. How CAN one get around those?”\n\n“Well, well, we shall know in a few hours now,” remarked Magnus.\n\n“Oh,” exclaimed Lyman, surprised, “it is for this morning, then. Why\naren't you at the court?”\n\n“It seemed undignified, boy,” answered the Governor. “We shall know soon\nenough.”\n\n“Good God!” exclaimed Harran abruptly, “when I think of what is\ninvolved. Why, Lyman, it's our home, the ranch house itself, nearly all\nLos Muertos, practically our whole fortune, and just now when there is\npromise of an enormous crop of wheat. And it is not only us. There are\nover half a million acres of the San Joaquin involved. In some cases of\nthe smaller ranches, it is the confiscation of the whole of the\nrancher's land. If this thing goes through, it will absolutely beggar\nnearly a hundred men. Broderson wouldn't have a thousand acres to his\nname. Why, it's monstrous.”\n\n“But the corporations offered to lease these lands,” remarked Lyman.\n“Are any of the ranchers taking up that offer--or are any of them buying\noutright?”\n\n“Buying! At the new figure!” exclaimed Harran, “at twenty and thirty an\nacre! Why, there's not one in ten that CAN. They are land-poor. And as\nfor leasing--leasing land they virtually own--no, there's precious few\nare doing that, thank God! That would be acknowledging the railroad's\nownership right away--forfeiting their rights for good. None of the\nLEAGUERS are doing it, I know. That would be the rankest treachery.”\n\nHe paused for a moment, drinking the rest of the mineral water, then\ninterrupting Lyman, who was about to speak to Presley, drawing him into\nthe conversation through politeness, said: “Matters are just romping\nright along to a crisis these days. It's a make or break for the wheat\ngrowers of the State now, no mistake. Here are the land cases and the\nnew grain tariff drawing to a head at about the same time. If we win our\nland cases, there's your new freight rates to be applied, and then all\nis beer and skittles. Won't the San Joaquin go wild if we pull it off,\nand I believe we will.”\n\n“How we wheat growers are exploited and trapped and deceived at\nevery turn,” observed Magnus sadly. “The courts, the capitalists, the\nrailroads, each of them in turn hoodwinks us into some new and wonderful\nscheme, only to betray us in the end. Well,” he added, turning to Lyman,\n“one thing at least we can depend on. We will cut their grain rates for\nthem, eh, Lyman?”\n\nLyman crossed his legs and settled himself in his office chair.\n\n“I have wanted to have a talk with you about that, sir,” he said. “Yes,\nwe will cut the rates--an average 10 per cent. cut throughout the\nState, as we are pledged. But I am going to warn you, Governor, and you,\nHarran; don't expect too much at first. The man who, even after twenty\nyears' training in the operation of railroads, can draw an equitable,\nsmoothly working schedule of freight rates between shipping point and\ncommon point, is capable of governing the United States. What with main\nlines, and leased lines, and points of transfer, and the laws governing\ncommon carriers, and the rulings of the Inter-State Commerce Commission,\nthe whole matter has become so confused that Vanderbilt himself couldn't\nstraighten it out. And how can it be expected that railroad commissions\nwho are chosen--well, let's be frank--as ours was, for instance, from\nout a number of men who don't know the difference between a switching\ncharge and a differential rate, are going to regulate the whole business\nin six months' time? Cut rates; yes, any fool can do that; any fool can\nwrite one dollar instead of two, but if you cut too low by a fraction of\none per cent. and if the railroad can get out an injunction, tie you\nup and show that your new rate prevents the road being operated at a\nprofit, how are you any better off?”\n\n“Your conscientiousness does you credit, Lyman,” said the Governor. “I\nrespect you for it, my son. I know you will be fair to the railroad.\nThat is all we want. Fairness to the corporation is fairness to the\nfarmer, and we won't expect you to readjust the whole matter out of\nhand. Take your time. We can afford to wait.”\n\n“And suppose the next commission is a railroad board, and reverses all\nour figures?”\n\nThe one-time mining king, the most redoubtable poker player of Calaveras\nCounty, permitted himself a momentary twinkle of his eyes.\n\n“By then it will be too late. We will, all of us, have made our fortunes\nby then.”\n\nThe remark left Presley astonished out of all measure He never could\naccustom himself to these strange lapses in the Governor's character.\nMagnus was by nature a public man, judicious, deliberate, standing firm\nfor principle, yet upon rare occasion, by some such remark as this, he\nwould betray the presence of a sub-nature of recklessness, inconsistent,\nall at variance with his creeds and tenets.\n\nAt the very bottom, when all was said and done, Magnus remained the\nForty-niner. Deep down in his heart the spirit of the Adventurer yet\npersisted. “We will all of us have made fortunes by then.” That was it\nprecisely. “After us the deluge.” For all his public spirit, for all his\nchampionship of justice and truth, his respect for law, Magnus remained\nthe gambler, willing to play for colossal stakes, to hazard a fortune on\nthe chance of winning a million. It was the true California spirit\nthat found expression through him, the spirit of the West, unwilling to\noccupy itself with details, refusing to wait, to be patient, to achieve\nby legitimate plodding; the miner's instinct of wealth acquired in a\nsingle night prevailed, in spite of all. It was in this frame of mind\nthat Magnus and the multitude of other ranchers of whom he was a type,\nfarmed their ranches. They had no love for their land. They were not\nattached to the soil. They worked their ranches as a quarter of a\ncentury before they had worked their mines. To husband the resources of\ntheir marvellous San Joaquin, they considered niggardly, petty, Hebraic.\nTo get all there was out of the land, to squeeze it dry, to exhaust it,\nseemed their policy. When, at last, the land worn out, would refuse to\nyield, they would invest their money in something else; by then, they\nwould all have made fortunes. They did not care. “After us the deluge.”\n\nLyman, however, was obviously uneasy, willing to change the subject. He\nrose to his feet, pulling down his cuffs.\n\n“By the way,” he observed, “I want you three to lunch with me to-day\nat my club. It is close by. You can wait there for news of the court's\ndecision as well as anywhere else, and I should like to show you the\nplace. I have just joined.”\n\nAt the club, when the four men were seated at a small table in the round\nwindow of the main room, Lyman's popularity with all classes was very\napparent. Hardly a man entered that did not call out a salutation to\nhim, some even coming over to shake his hand. He seemed to be every\nman's friend, and to all he seemed equally genial. His affability, even\nto those whom he disliked, was unfailing.\n\n“See that fellow yonder,” he said to Magnus, indicating a certain\nmiddle-aged man, flamboyantly dressed, who wore his hair long, who\nwas afflicted with sore eyes, and the collar of whose velvet coat was\nsprinkled with dandruff, “that's Hartrath, the artist, a man absolutely\ndevoid of even the commonest decency. How he got in here is a mystery to\nme.”\n\nYet, when this Hartrath came across to say “How do you do” to Lyman,\nLyman was as eager in his cordiality as his warmest friend could have\nexpected.\n\n“Why the devil are you so chummy with him, then?” observed Harran when\nHartrath had gone away.\n\nLyman's explanation was vague. The truth of the matter was, that\nMagnus's oldest son was consumed by inordinate ambition. Political\npreferment was his dream, and to the realisation of this dream\npopularity was an essential. Every man who could vote, blackguard or\ngentleman, was to be conciliated, if possible. He made it his study to\nbecome known throughout the entire community--to put influential men\nunder obligations to himself. He never forgot a name or a face. With\neverybody he was the hail-fellow-well-met. His ambition was not trivial.\nIn his disregard for small things, he resembled his father. Municipal\noffice had no attraction for him. His goal was higher. He had planned\nhis life twenty years ahead. Already Sheriff's Attorney, Assistant\nDistrict Attorney and Railroad Commissioner, he could, if he desired,\nattain the office of District Attorney itself. Just now, it was a\nquestion with him whether or not it would be politic to fill this\noffice. Would it advance or sidetrack him in the career he had outlined\nfor himself? Lyman wanted to be something better than District Attorney,\nbetter than Mayor, than State Senator, or even than member of the United\nStates Congress. He wanted to be, in fact, what his father was only in\nname--to succeed where Magnus had failed. He wanted to be governor\nof the State. He had put his teeth together, and, deaf to all other\nconsiderations, blind to all other issues, he worked with the infinite\nslowness, the unshakable tenacity of the coral insect to this one end.\n\nAfter luncheon was over, Lyman ordered cigars and liqueurs, and with\nthe three others returned to the main room of the club. However, their\nformer place in the round window was occupied. A middle-aged man,\nwith iron grey hair and moustache, who wore a frock coat and a white\nwaistcoat, and in some indefinable manner suggested a retired naval\nofficer, was sitting at their table smoking a long, thin cigar. At sight\nof him, Presley became animated. He uttered a mild exclamation:\n\n“Why, isn't that Mr. Cedarquist?”\n\n“Cedarquist?” repeated Lyman Derrick. “I know him well. Yes, of course,\nit is,” he continued. “Governor, you must know him. He is one of our\nrepresentative men. You would enjoy talking to him. He was the head of\nthe big Atlas Iron Works. They have shut down recently, you know.\nNot failed exactly, but just ceased to be a paying investment, and\nCedarquist closed them out. He has other interests, though. He's a rich\nman--a capitalist.”\n\nLyman brought the group up to the gentleman in question and introduced\nthem. “Mr. Magnus Derrick, of course,” observed Cedarquist, as he took\nthe Governor's hand. “I've known you by repute for some time, sir. This\nis a great pleasure, I assure you.” Then, turning to Presley, he added:\n“Hello, Pres, my boy. How is the great, the very great Poem getting on?”\n\n“It's not getting on at all, sir,” answered Presley, in some\nembarrassment, as they all sat down. “In fact, I've about given up the\nidea. There's so much interest in what you might call 'living issues'\ndown at Los Muertos now, that I'm getting further and further from it\nevery day.”\n\n“I should say as much,” remarked the manufacturer, turning towards\nMagnus. “I'm watching your fight with Shelgrim, Mr. Derrick, with every\ndegree of interest.” He raised his drink of whiskey and soda. “Here's\nsuccess to you.”\n\nAs he replaced his glass, the artist Hartrath joined the group\nuninvited. As a pretext, he engaged Lyman in conversation. Lyman, he\nbelieved, was a man with a “pull” at the City Hall. In connection with a\nprojected Million-Dollar Fair and Flower Festival, which at that moment\nwas the talk of the city, certain statues were to be erected, and\nHartrath bespoke Lyman's influence to further the pretensions of a\nsculptor friend of his, who wished to be Art Director of the affair. In\nthe matter of this Fair and Flower Festival, Hartrath was not lacking in\nenthusiasm. He addressed the others with extravagant gestures, blinking\nhis inflamed eyelids.\n\n“A million dollars,” he exclaimed. “Hey! think of that. Why, do you know\nthat we have five hundred thousand practically pledged already? Talk\nabout public spirit, gentlemen, this is the most public-spirited city\non the continent. And the money is not thrown away. We will have Eastern\nvisitors here by the thousands--capitalists--men with money to invest.\nThe million we spend on our fair will be money in our pockets. Ah, you\nshould see how the women of this city are taking hold of the matter.\nThey are giving all kinds of little entertainments, teas, 'Olde Tyme\nSinging Skules,' amateur theatricals, gingerbread fetes, all for the\nbenefit of the fund, and the business men, too--pouring out their money\nlike water. It is splendid, splendid, to see a community so patriotic.”\n\nThe manufacturer, Cedarquist, fixed the artist with a glance of\nmelancholy interest.\n\n“And how much,” he remarked, “will they contribute--your gingerbread\nwomen and public-spirited capitalists, towards the blowing up of the\nruins of the Atlas Iron Works?”\n\n“Blowing up? I don't understand,” murmured the artist, surprised. “When\nyou get your Eastern capitalists out here with your Million-Dollar\nFair,” continued Cedarquist, “you don't propose, do you, to let them see\na Million-Dollar Iron Foundry standing idle, because of the indifference\nof San Francisco business men? They might ask pertinent questions,\nyour capitalists, and we should have to answer that our business men\npreferred to invest their money in corner lots and government bonds,\nrather than to back up a legitimate, industrial enterprise. We don't\nwant fairs. We want active furnaces. We don't want public statues, and\nfountains, and park extensions and gingerbread fetes. We want business\nenterprise. Isn't it like us? Isn't it like us?” he exclaimed sadly.\n“What a melancholy comment! San Francisco! It is not a city--it is a\nMidway Plaisance. California likes to be fooled. Do you suppose Shelgrim\ncould convert the whole San Joaquin Valley into his back yard otherwise?\nIndifference to public affairs--absolute indifference, it stamps us all.\nOur State is the very paradise of fakirs. You and your Million-Dollar\nFair!” He turned to Hartrath with a quiet smile. “It is just such men\nas you, Mr. Hartrath, that are the ruin of us. You organise a sham of\ntinsel and pasteboard, put on fool's cap and bells, beat a gong at a\nstreet corner, and the crowd cheers you and drops nickels into your hat.\nYour ginger-bread fete; yes, I saw it in full blast the other night on\nthe grounds of one of your women's places on Sutter Street. I was on my\nway home from the last board meeting of the Atlas Company. A gingerbread\nfete, my God! and the Atlas plant shutting down for want of financial\nbacking. A million dollars spent to attract the Eastern investor, in\norder to show him an abandoned rolling mill, wherein the only activity\nis the sale of remnant material and scrap steel.”\n\nLyman, however, interfered. The situation was becoming strained. He\ntried to conciliate the three men--the artist, the manufacturer, and the\nfarmer, the warring elements. But Hartrath, unwilling to face the enmity\nthat he felt accumulating against him, took himself away. A picture of\nhis--“A Study of the Contra Costa Foot-hills”--was to be raffled in the\nclub rooms for the benefit of the Fair. He, himself, was in charge of\nthe matter. He disappeared.\n\nCedarquist looked after him with contemplative interest. Then, turning\nto Magnus, excused himself for the acridity of his words.\n\n“He's no worse than many others, and the people of this State and city\nare, after all, only a little more addle-headed than other Americans.”\n It was his favourite topic. Sure of the interest of his hearers, he\nunburdened himself.\n\n“If I were to name the one crying evil of American life, Mr. Derrick,”\n he continued, “it would be the indifference of the better people to\npublic affairs. It is so in all our great centres. There are other great\ntrusts, God knows, in the United States besides our own dear P. and S.\nW. Railroad. Every State has its own grievance. If it is not a railroad\ntrust, it is a sugar trust, or an oil trust, or an industrial trust,\nthat exploits the People, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ALLOW IT. The indifference\nof the People is the opportunity of the despot. It is as true as that\nthe whole is greater than the part, and the maxim is so old that it is\ntrite--it is laughable. It is neglected and disused for the sake of\nsome new ingenious and complicated theory, some wonderful scheme of\nreorganisation, but the fact remains, nevertheless, simple, fundamental,\neverlasting. The People have but to say 'No,' and not the strongest\ntyranny, political, religious, or financial, that was ever organised,\ncould survive one week.”\n\nThe others, absorbed, attentive, approved, nodding their heads in\nsilence as the manufacturer finished.\n\n“That's one reason, Mr. Derrick,” the other resumed after a moment, “why\nI have been so glad to meet you. You and your League are trying to say\n'No' to the trust. I hope you will succeed. If your example will rally\nthe People to your cause, you will. Otherwise--” he shook his head.\n\n“One stage of the fight is to be passed this very day,” observed Magnus.\n“My sons and myself are expecting hourly news from the City Hall, a\ndecision in our case is pending.”\n\n“We are both of us fighters, it seems, Mr. Derrick,” said Cedarquist.\n“Each with his particular enemy. We are well met, indeed, the farmer and\nthe manufacturer, both in the same grist between the two millstones\nof the lethargy of the Public and the aggression of the Trust, the two\ngreat evils of modern America. Pres, my boy, there is your epic poem\nready to hand.”\n\nBut Cedarquist was full of another idea. Rarely did so favourable an\nopportunity present itself for explaining his theories, his ambitions.\nAddressing himself to Magnus, he continued:\n\n“Fortunately for myself, the Atlas Company was not my only investment.\nI have other interests. The building of ships--steel sailing ships--has\nbeen an ambition of mine,--for this purpose, Mr. Derrick, to carry\nAmerican wheat. For years, I have studied this question of American\nwheat, and at last, I have arrived at a theory. Let me explain. At\npresent, all our California wheat goes to Liverpool, and from that port\nis distributed over the world. But a change is coming. I am sure of it.\nYou young men,” he turned to Presley, Lyman, and Harran, “will live to\nsee it. Our century is about done. The great word of this nineteenth\ncentury has been Production. The great word of the twentieth century\nwill be--listen to me, you youngsters--Markets. As a market for our\nProduction--or let me take a concrete example--as a market for our\nWHEAT, Europe is played out. Population in Europe is not increasing fast\nenough to keep up with the rapidity of our production. In some cases,\nas in France, the population is stationary. WE, however, have gone on\nproducing wheat at a tremendous rate.\n\n“The result is over-production. We supply more than Europe can eat, and\ndown go the prices. The remedy is NOT in the curtailing of our wheat\nareas, but in this, we MUST HAVE NEW MARKETS, GREATER MARKETS. For years\nwe have been sending our wheat from East to West, from California to\nEurope. But the time will come when we must send it from West to East.\nWe must march with the course of empire, not against it. I mean, we\nmust look to China. Rice in China is losing its nutritive quality. The\nAsiatics, though, must be fed; if not on rice, then on wheat. Why, Mr.\nDerrick, if only one-half the population of China ate a half ounce of\nflour per man per day all the wheat areas in California could not feed\nthem. Ah, if I could only hammer that into the brains of every rancher\nof the San Joaquin, yes, and of every owner of every bonanza farm in\nDakota and Minnesota. Send your wheat to China; handle it yourselves;\ndo away with the middleman; break up the Chicago wheat pits and elevator\nrings and mixing houses. When in feeding China you have decreased the\nEuropean shipments, the effect is instantaneous. Prices go up in Europe\nwithout having the least effect upon the prices in China. We hold the\nkey, we have the wheat,--infinitely more than we ourselves can eat.\nAsia and Europe must look to America to be fed. What fatuous neglect of\nopportunity to continue to deluge Europe with our surplus food when the\nEast trembles upon the verge of starvation!”\n\nThe two men, Cedarquist and Magnus, continued the conversation a little\nfurther. The manufacturer's idea was new to the Governor. He was greatly\ninterested. He withdrew from the conversation. Thoughtful, he leaned\nback in his place, stroking the bridge of his beak-like nose with a\ncrooked forefinger.\n\nCedarquist turned to Harran and began asking details as to the\nconditions of the wheat growers of the San Joaquin. Lyman still\nmaintained an attitude of polite aloofness, yawning occasionally behind\nthree fingers, and Presley was left to the company of his own thoughts.\n\nThere had been a day when the affairs and grievances of the farmers of\nhis acquaintance--Magnus, Annixter, Osterman, and old Broderson--had\nfilled him only with disgust. His mind full of a great, vague epic poem\nof the West, he had kept himself apart, disdainful of what he chose to\nconsider their petty squabbles. But the scene in Annixter's harness room\nhad thrilled and uplifted him. He was palpitating with excitement all\nthrough the succeeding months. He abandoned the idea of an epic poem. In\nsix months he had not written a single verse. Day after day he trembled\nwith excitement as the relations between the Trust and League became\nmore and more strained. He saw the matter in its true light. It was\ntypical. It was the world-old war between Freedom and Tyranny, and at\ntimes his hatred of the railroad shook him like a crisp and withered\nreed, while the languid indifference of the people of the State to the\nquarrel filled him with a blind exasperation.\n\nBut, as he had once explained to Vanamee, he must find expression. He\nfelt that he would suffocate otherwise. He had begun to keep a journal.\nAs the inclination spurred him, he wrote down his thoughts and ideas in\nthis, sometimes every day, sometimes only three or four times a month.\nAlso he flung aside his books of poems--Milton, Tennyson, Browning, even\nHomer--and addressed himself to Mill, Malthus, Young, Poushkin, Henry\nGeorge, Schopenhauer. He attacked the subject of Social Inequality with\nunbounded enthusiasm. He devoured, rather than read, and emerged from\nthe affair, his mind a confused jumble of conflicting notions, sick with\nover-effort, raging against injustice and oppression, and with not one\nsane suggestion as to remedy or redress.\n\nThe butt of his cigarette scorched his fingers and roused him from his\nbrooding. In the act of lighting another, he glanced across the room\nand was surprised to see two very prettily dressed young women in the\ncompany of an older gentleman, in a long frock coat, standing before\nHartrath's painting, examining it, their heads upon one side.\n\nPresley uttered a murmur of surprise. He, himself, was a member of the\nclub, and the presence of women within its doors, except on special\noccasions, was not tolerated. He turned to Lyman Derrick for an\nexplanation, but this other had also seen the women and abruptly\nexclaimed:\n\n“I declare, I had forgotten about it. Why, this is Ladies' Day, of\ncourse.”\n\n“Why, yes,” interposed Cedarquist, glancing at the women over his\nshoulder. “Didn't you know? They let 'em in twice a year, you remember,\nand this is a double occasion. They are going to raffle Hartrath's\npicture,--for the benefit of the Gingerbread Fair. Why, you are not\nup to date, Lyman. This is a sacred and religious rite,--an important\npublic event.”\n\n“Of course, of course,” murmured Lyman. He found means to survey Harran\nand Magnus. Certainly, neither his father nor his brother were dressed\nfor the function that impended. He had been stupid. Magnus invariably\nattracted attention, and now with his trousers strapped under his boots,\nhis wrinkled frock coat--Lyman twisted his cuffs into sight with an\nimpatient, nervous movement of his wrists, glancing a second time at\nhis brother's pink face, forward curling, yellow hair and clothes of\na country cut. But there was no help for it. He wondered what were the\nclub regulations in the matter of bringing in visitors on Ladies' Day.\n“Sure enough, Ladies' Day,” he remarked, “I am very glad you struck it,\nGovernor. We can sit right where we are. I guess this is as good a place\nas any to see the crowd. It's a good chance to see all the big guns of\nthe city. Do you expect your people here, Mr. Cedarquist?”\n\n“My wife may come, and my daughters,” said the manufacturer.\n\n“Ah,” murmured Presley, “so much the better. I was going to give myself\nthe pleasure of calling upon your daughters, Mr. Cedarquist, this\nafternoon.”\n\n“You can save your carfare, Pres,” said Cedarquist, “you will see them\nhere.”\n\nNo doubt, the invitations for the occasion had appointed one o'clock as\nthe time, for between that hour and two, the guests arrived in an almost\nunbroken stream. From their point of vantage in the round window of the\nmain room, Magnus, his two sons, and Presley looked on very interested.\nCedarquist had excused himself, affirming that he must look out for his\nwomen folk.\n\nOf every ten of the arrivals, seven, at least, were ladies. They\nentered the room--this unfamiliar masculine haunt, where their husbands,\nbrothers, and sons spent so much of their time--with a certain show of\nhesitancy and little, nervous, oblique glances, moving their heads from\nside to side like a file of hens venturing into a strange barn. They\ncame in groups, ushered by a single member of the club, doing the\nhonours with effusive bows and polite gestures, indicating the various\nobjects of interest, pictures, busts, and the like, that decorated the\nroom.\n\nFresh from his recollections of Bonneville, Guadalajara, and the dance\nin Annixter's barn, Presley was astonished at the beauty of these women\nand the elegance of their toilettes. The crowd thickened rapidly. A\nmurmur of conversation arose, subdued, gracious, mingled with the soft\nrustle of silk, grenadines, velvet. The scent of delicate perfumes\nspread in the air, Violet de Parme, Peau d'Espagne. Colours of the most\nharmonious blends appeared and disappeared at intervals in the slowly\nmoving press, touches of lavender-tinted velvets, pale violet crepes and\ncream-coloured appliqued laces.\n\nThere seemed to be no need of introductions. Everybody appeared to\nbe acquainted. There was no awkwardness, no constraint. The assembly\ndisengaged an impression of refined pleasure. On every hand, innumerable\ndialogues seemed to go forward easily and naturally, without break or\ninterruption, witty, engaging, the couple never at a loss for repartee.\nA third party was gracefully included, then a fourth. Little groups were\nformed,--groups that divided themselves, or melted into other groups,\nor disintegrated again into isolated pairs, or lost themselves in\nthe background of the mass,--all without friction, without\nembarrassment,--the whole affair going forward of itself, decorous,\ntactful, well-bred.\n\nAt a distance, and not too loud, a stringed orchestra sent up a pleasing\nhum. Waiters, with brass buttons on their full dress coats, went from\ngroup to group, silent, unobtrusive, serving salads and ices.\n\nBut the focus of the assembly was the little space before Hartrath's\npainting. It was called “A Study of the Contra Costa Foothills,” and\nwas set in a frame of natural redwood, the bark still adhering. It was\nconspicuously displayed on an easel at the right of the entrance to the\nmain room of the club, and was very large. In the foreground, and to\nthe left, under the shade of a live-oak, stood a couple of reddish cows,\nknee-deep in a patch of yellow poppies, while in the right-hand corner,\nto balance the composition, was placed a girl in a pink dress and white\nsunbonnet, in which the shadows were indicated by broad dashes of pale\nblue paint. The ladies and young girls examined the production with\nlittle murmurs of admiration, hazarding remembered phrases,\nsearching for the exact balance between generous praise and critical\ndiscrimination, expressing their opinions in the mild technicalities of\nthe Art Books and painting classes. They spoke of atmospheric effects,\nof middle distance, of “chiaro-oscuro,” of fore-shortening, of the\ndecomposition of light, of the subordination of individuality to\nfidelity of interpretation.\n\nOne tall girl, with hair almost white in its blondness, having observed\nthat the handling of the masses reminded her strongly of Corot, her\ncompanion, who carried a gold lorgnette by a chain around her neck,\nanswered:\n\n“Ah! Millet, perhaps, but not Corot.”\n\nThis verdict had an immediate success. It was passed from group to\ngroup. It seemed to imply a delicate distinction that carried conviction\nat once. It was decided formally that the reddish brown cows in the\npicture were reminiscent of Daubigny, and that the handling of the\nmasses was altogether Millet, but that the general effect was not quite\nCorot.\n\nPresley, curious to see the painting that was the subject of so much\ndiscussion, had left the group in the round window, and stood close by\nHartrath, craning his head over the shoulders of the crowd, trying to\ncatch a glimpse of the reddish cows, the milk-maid and the blue painted\nfoothills. He was suddenly aware of Cedarquist's voice in his ear, and,\nturning about, found himself face to face with the manufacturer, his\nwife and his two daughters.\n\nThere was a meeting. Salutations were exchanged, Presley shaking hands\nall around, expressing his delight at seeing his old friends once more,\nfor he had known the family from his boyhood, Mrs. Cedarquist being his\naunt. Mrs. Cedarquist and her two daughters declared that the air of Los\nMuertos must certainly have done him a world of good. He was stouter,\nthere could be no doubt of it. A little pale, perhaps. He was fatiguing\nhimself with his writing, no doubt. Ah, he must take care. Health was\neverything, after all. Had he been writing any more verse? Every month\nthey scanned the magazines, looking for his name.\n\nMrs. Cedarquist was a fashionable woman, the president or chairman of\na score of clubs. She was forever running after fads, appearing\ncontinually in the society wherein she moved with new and astounding\nproteges--fakirs whom she unearthed no one knew where, discovering them\nlong in advance of her companions. Now it was a Russian Countess, with\ndirty finger nails, who travelled throughout America and borrowed money;\nnow an Aesthete who possessed a wonderful collection of topaz gems, who\nsubmitted decorative schemes for the interior arrangement of houses and\nwho “received” in Mrs. Cedarquist's drawing-rooms dressed in a white\nvelvet cassock; now a widow of some Mohammedan of Bengal or Rajputana,\nwho had a blue spot in the middle of her forehead and who solicited\ncontributions for her sisters in affliction; now a certain bearded poet,\nrecently back from the Klondike; now a decayed musician who had been\nejected from a young ladies' musical conservatory of Europe because\nof certain surprising pamphlets on free love, and who had come to San\nFrancisco to introduce the community to the music of Brahms; now a\nJapanese youth who wore spectacles and a grey flannel shirt and who,\nat intervals, delivered himself of the most astonishing poems, vague,\nunrhymed, unmetrical lucubrations, incoherent, bizarre; now a Christian\nScientist, a lean, grey woman, whose creed was neither Christian nor\nscientific; now a university professor, with the bristling beard of\nan anarchist chief-of-section, and a roaring, guttural voice, whose\nintenseness left him gasping and apoplectic; now a civilised Cherokee\nwith a mission; now a female elocutionist, whose forte was Byron's Songs\nof Greece; now a high caste Chinaman; now a miniature painter; now a\ntenor, a pianiste, a mandolin player, a missionary, a drawing master,\na virtuoso, a collector, an Armenian, a botanist with a new flower, a\ncritic with a new theory, a doctor with a new treatment.\n\nAnd all these people had a veritable mania for declamation and fancy\ndress. The Russian Countess gave talks on the prisons of Siberia,\nwearing the headdress and pinchbeck ornaments of a Slav bride; the\nAesthete, in his white cassock, gave readings on obscure questions\nof art and ethics. The widow of India, in the costume of her caste,\ndescribed the social life of her people at home. The bearded poet,\nperspiring in furs and boots of reindeer skin, declaimed verses of his\nown composition about the wild life of the Alaskan mining camps. The\nJapanese youth, in the silk robes of the Samurai two-sworded nobles,\nread from his own works--“The flat-bordered earth, nailed down at night,\nrusting under the darkness,” “The brave, upright rains that came down\nlike errands from iron-bodied yore-time.” The Christian Scientist, in\nfunereal, impressive black, discussed the contra-will and pan-psychic\nhylozoism. The university professor put on a full dress suit and lisle\nthread gloves at three in the afternoon and before literary clubs and\ncircles bellowed extracts from Goethe and Schiler in the German, shaking\nhis fists, purple with vehemence. The Cherokee, arrayed in fringed\nbuckskin and blue beads, rented from a costumer, intoned folk songs of\nhis people in the vernacular. The elocutionist in cheese-cloth toga and\ntin bracelets, rendered “The Isles of Greece, where burning Sappho\nloved and sung.” The Chinaman, in the robes of a mandarin, lectured\non Confucius. The Armenian, in fez and baggy trousers, spoke of the\nUnspeakable Turk. The mandolin player, dressed like a bull fighter, held\nmusical conversaziones, interpreting the peasant songs of Andalusia.\n\nIt was the Fake, the eternal, irrepressible Sham; glib, nimble,\nubiquitous, tricked out in all the paraphernalia of imposture, an\nendless defile of charlatans that passed interminably before the gaze of\nthe city, marshalled by “lady presidents,” exploited by clubs of women,\nby literary societies, reading circles, and culture organisations. The\nattention the Fake received, the time devoted to it, the money which it\nabsorbed, were incredible. It was all one that impostor after impostor\nwas exposed; it was all one that the clubs, the circles, the societies\nwere proved beyond doubt to have been swindled. The more the Philistine\npress of the city railed and guyed, the more the women rallied to\nthe defence of their protege of the hour. That their favourite was\npersecuted, was to them a veritable rapture. Promptly they invested the\napostle of culture with the glamour of a martyr.\n\nThe fakirs worked the community as shell-game tricksters work a county\nfair, departing with bursting pocket-books, passing on the word to the\nnext in line, assured that the place was not worked out, knowing well\nthat there was enough for all.\n\nMore frequently the public of the city, unable to think of more than one\nthing at one time, prostrated itself at the feet of a single apostle,\nbut at other moments, such as the present, when a Flower Festival or a\nMillion-Dollar Fair aroused enthusiasm in all quarters, the occasion\nwas one of gala for the entire Fake. The decayed professors, virtuosi,\nlitterateurs, and artists thronged to the place en masse. Their clamour\nfilled all the air. On every hand one heard the scraping of violins,\nthe tinkling of mandolins, the suave accents of “art talks,” the\nincoherencies of poets, the declamation of elocutionists, the\ninarticulate wanderings of the Japanese, the confused mutterings of the\nCherokee, the guttural bellowing of the German university professor, all\nin the name of the Million-Dollar Fair. Money to the extent of hundreds\nof thousands was set in motion.\n\nMrs. Cedarquist was busy from morning until night. One after another,\nshe was introduced to newly arrived fakirs. To each poet, to each\nlitterateur, to each professor she addressed the same question:\n\n“How long have you known you had this power?”\n\nShe spent her days in one quiver of excitement and jubilation. She\nwas “in the movement.” The people of the city were awakening to a\nRealisation of the Beautiful, to a sense of the higher needs of life.\nThis was Art, this was Literature, this was Culture and Refinement. The\nRenaissance had appeared in the West.\n\nShe was a short, rather stout, red-faced, very much over-dressed little\nwoman of some fifty years. She was rich in her own name, even before\nher marriage, being a relative of Shelgrim himself and on familiar terms\nwith the great financier and his family. Her husband, while deploring\nthe policy of the railroad, saw no good reason for quarrelling with\nShelgrim, and on more than one occasion had dined at his house. On this\noccasion, delighted that she had come upon a “minor poet,” she insisted\nupon presenting him to Hartrath.\n\n“You two should have so much in common,” she explained.\n\nPresley shook the flaccid hand of the artist, murmuring\nconventionalities, while Mrs. Cedarquist hastened to say:\n\n“I am sure you know Mr. Presley's verse, Mr. Hartrath. You should,\nbelieve me. You two have much in common. I can see so much that is alike\nin your modes of interpreting nature. In Mr. Presley's sonnet, 'The\nBetter Part,' there is the same note as in your picture, the same\nsincerity of tone, the same subtlety of touch, the same nuances,--ah.”\n\n“Oh, my dear Madame,” murmured the artist, interrupting Presley's\nimpatient retort; “I am a mere bungler. You don't mean quite that, I am\nsure. I am too sensitive. It is my cross. Beauty,” he closed his sore\neyes with a little expression of pain, “beauty unmans me.”\n\nBut Mrs. Cedarquist was not listening. Her eyes were fixed on the\nartist's luxuriant hair, a thick and glossy mane, that all but covered\nhis coat collar.\n\n“Leonine!” she murmured-- “leonine! Like Samson of old.”\n\nHowever, abruptly bestirring herself, she exclaimed a second later:\n\n“But I must run away. I am selling tickets for you this afternoon, Mr.\nHartrath. I am having such success. Twenty-five already. Mr. Presley,\nyou will take two chances, I am sure, and, oh, by the way, I have such\ngood news. You know I am one of the lady members of the subscription\ncommittee for our Fair, and you know we approached Mr. Shelgrim for a\ndonation to help along. Oh, such a liberal patron, a real Lorenzo di'\nMedici. In the name of the Pacific and Southwestern he has subscribed,\nthink of it, five thousand dollars; and yet they will talk of the\nmeanness of the railroad.”\n\n“Possibly it is to his interest,” murmured Presley. “The fairs and\nfestivals bring people to the city over his railroad.”\n\nBut the others turned on him, expostulating.\n\n“Ah, you Philistine,” declared Mrs. Cedarquist. “And this from YOU!,\nPresley; to attribute such base motives----”\n\n“If the poets become materialised, Mr. Presley,” declared Hartrath,\n“what can we say to the people?”\n\n“And Shelgrim encourages your million-dollar fairs and fetes,” said a\nvoice at Presley's elbow, “because it is throwing dust in the people's\neyes.”\n\nThe group turned about and saw Cedarquist, who had come up unobserved\nin time to catch the drift of the talk. But he spoke without bitterness;\nthere was even a good-humoured twinkle in his eyes.\n\n“Yes,” he continued, smiling, “our dear Shelgrim promotes your fairs,\nnot only as Pres says, because it is money in his pocket, but because\nit amuses the people, distracts their attention from the doings of his\nrailroad. When Beatrice was a baby and had little colics, I used to\njingle my keys in front of her nose, and it took her attention from the\npain in her tummy; so Shelgrim.”\n\nThe others laughed good-humouredly, protesting, nevertheless, and Mrs.\nCedarquist shook her finger in warning at the artist and exclaimed:\n\n“The Philistines be upon thee, Samson!”\n\n“By the way,” observed Hartrath, willing to change the subject, “I hear\nyou are on the Famine Relief Committee. Does your work progress?”\n\n“Oh, most famously, I assure you,” she said. “Such a movement as we\nhave started. Those poor creatures. The photographs of them are simply\ndreadful. I had the committee to luncheon the other day and we passed\nthem around. We are getting subscriptions from all over the State, and\nMr. Cedarquist is to arrange for the ship.”\n\nThe Relief Committee in question was one of a great number that had been\nformed in California--and all over the Union, for the matter of that--to\nprovide relief for the victims of a great famine in Central India. The\nwhole world had been struck with horror at the reports of suffering\nand mortality in the affected districts, and had hastened to send aid.\nCertain women of San Francisco, with Mrs. Cedarquist at their head, had\norganised a number of committees, but the manufacturer's wife turned the\nmeetings of these committees into social affairs--luncheons, teas, where\none discussed the ways and means of assisting the starving Asiatics over\nteacups and plates of salad.\n\nShortly afterward a mild commotion spread throughout the assemblage of\nthe club's guests. The drawing of the numbers in the raffle was about to\nbe made. Hartrath, in a flurry of agitation, excused himself. Cedarquist\ntook Presley by the arm.\n\n“Pres, let's get out of this,” he said. “Come into the wine room and I\nwill shake you for a glass of sherry.”\n\nThey had some difficulty in extricating themselves. The main room where\nthe drawing was to take place suddenly became densely thronged. All the\nguests pressed eagerly about the table near the picture, upon which one\nof the hall boys had just placed a ballot box containing the numbers.\nThe ladies, holding their tickets in their hands, pushed forward. A\nstaccato chatter of excited murmurs arose. “What became of Harran and\nLyman and the Governor?” inquired Presley.\n\nLyman had disappeared, alleging a business engagement, but Magnus and\nhis younger son had retired to the library of the club on the floor\nabove. It was almost deserted. They were deep in earnest conversation.\n\n“Harran,” said the Governor, with decision, “there is a deal, there, in\nwhat Cedarquist says. Our wheat to China, hey, boy?”\n\n“It is certainly worth thinking of, sir.”\n\n“It appeals to me, boy; it appeals to me. It's big and there's a fortune\nin it. Big chances mean big returns; and I know--your old father isn't a\nback number yet, Harran--I may not have so wide an outlook as our friend\nCedarquist, but I am quick to see my chance. Boy, the whole East is\nopening, disintegrating before the Anglo-Saxon. It is time that bread\nstuffs, as well, should make markets for themselves in the Orient. Just\nat this moment, too, when Lyman will scale down freight rates so we can\nhaul to tidewater at little cost.”\n\nMagnus paused again, his frown beetling, and in the silence the\nexcited murmur from the main room of the club, the soprano chatter of a\nmultitude of women, found its way to the deserted library.\n\n“I believe it's worth looking into, Governor,” asserted Harran.\n\nMagnus rose, and, his hands behind him, paced the floor of the library\na couple of times, his imagination all stimulated and vivid. The\ngreat gambler perceived his Chance, the kaleidoscopic shifting of\ncircumstances that made a Situation. It had come silently, unexpectedly.\nHe had not seen its approach. Abruptly he woke one morning to see the\ncombination realised. But also he saw a vision. A sudden and abrupt\nrevolution in the Wheat. A new world of markets discovered, the matter\nas important as the discovery of America. The torrent of wheat was to be\ndiverted, flowing back upon itself in a sudden, colossal eddy, stranding\nthe middleman, the ENTRE-PRENEUR, the elevator-and mixing-house men\ndry and despairing, their occupation gone. He saw the farmer suddenly\nemancipated, the world's food no longer at the mercy of the speculator,\nthousands upon thousands of men set free of the grip of Trust and ring\nand monopoly acting for themselves, selling their own wheat, organising\ninto one gigantic trust, themselves, sending their agents to all the\nentry ports of China. Himself, Annixter, Broderson and Osterman would\npool their issues. He would convince them of the magnificence of the new\nmovement. They would be its pioneers. Harran would be sent to Hong Kong\nto represent the four. They would charter--probably buy--a ship, perhaps\none of Cedarquist's, American built, the nation's flag at the peak, and\nthe sailing of that ship, gorged with the crops from Broderson's and\nOsterman's ranches, from Quien Sabe and Los Muertos, would be like the\nsailing of the caravels from Palos. It would mark a new era; it would\nmake an epoch.\n\nWith this vision still expanding before the eye of his mind, Magnus,\nwith Harran at his elbow, prepared to depart.\n\nThey descended to the lower floor and involved themselves for a moment\nin the throng of fashionables that blocked the hallway and the entrance\nto the main room, where the numbers of the raffle were being drawn. Near\nthe head of the stairs they encountered Presley and Cedarquist, who had\njust come out of the wine room.\n\nMagnus, still on fire with the new idea, pressed a few questions upon\nthe manufacturer before bidding him good-bye. He wished to talk further\nupon the great subject, interested as to details, but Cedarquist was\nvague in his replies. He was no farmer, he hardly knew wheat when he saw\nit, only he knew the trend of the world's affairs; he felt them to be\nsetting inevitably eastward.\n\nHowever, his very vagueness was a further inspiration to the Governor.\nHe swept details aside. He saw only the grand coup, the huge results,\nthe East conquered, the march of empire rolling westward, finally\narriving at its starting point, the vague, mysterious Orient.\n\nHe saw his wheat, like the crest of an advancing billow, crossing the\nPacific, bursting upon Asia, flooding the Orient in a golden torrent. It\nwas the new era. He had lived to see the death of the old and the birth\nof the new; first the mine, now the ranch; first gold, now wheat. Once\nagain he became the pioneer, hardy, brilliant, taking colossal chances,\nblazing the way, grasping a fortune--a million in a single day. All the\nbigness of his nature leaped up again within him. At the magnitude of\nthe inspiration he felt young again, indomitable, the leader at last,\nking of his fellows, wresting from fortune at this eleventh hour, before\nhis old age, the place of high command which so long had been denied\nhim. At last he could achieve.\n\nAbruptly Magnus was aware that some one had spoken his name. He looked\nabout and saw behind him, at a little distance, two gentlemen, strangers\nto him. They had withdrawn from the crowd into a little recess.\nEvidently having no women to look after, they had lost interest in the\nafternoon's affair. Magnus realised that they had not seen him. One of\nthem was reading aloud to his companion from an evening edition of that\nday's newspaper. It was in the course of this reading that Magnus caught\nthe sound of his name. He paused, listening, and Presley, Harran and\nCedarquist followed his example. Soon they all understood. They were\nlistening to the report of the judge's decision, for which Magnus was\nwaiting--the decision in the case of the League vs. the Railroad. For\nthe moment, the polite clamour of the raffle hushed itself--the winning\nnumber was being drawn. The guests held their breath, and in the ensuing\nsilence Magnus and the others heard these words distinctly:\n\n“.... It follows that the title to the lands in question is in the\nplaintiff--the Pacific and Southwestern Railroad, and the defendants\nhave no title, and their possession is wrongful. There must be findings\nand judgment for the plaintiff, and it is so ordered.”\n\nIn spite of himself, Magnus paled. Harran shut his teeth with an oath.\nTheir exaltation of the previous moment collapsed like a pyramid of\ncards. The vision of the new movement of the wheat, the conquest of the\nEast, the invasion of the Orient, seemed only the flimsiest mockery.\nWith a brusque wrench, they were snatched back to reality. Between\nthem and the vision, between the fecund San Joaquin, reeking with\nfruitfulness, and the millions of Asia crowding toward the verge of\nstarvation, lay the iron-hearted monster of steel and steam, implacable,\ninsatiable, huge--its entrails gorged with the life blood that it\nsucked from an entire commonwealth, its ever hungry maw glutted with the\nharvests that should have fed the famished bellies of the whole world of\nthe Orient.\n\nBut abruptly, while the four men stood there, gazing into each other's\nfaces, a vigorous hand-clapping broke out. The raffle of Hartrath's\npicture was over, and as Presley turned about he saw Mrs. Cedarquist\nand her two daughters signalling eagerly to the manufacturer, unable to\nreach him because of the intervening crowd. Then Mrs. Cedarquist raised\nher voice and cried:\n\n“I've won. I've won.”\n\nUnnoticed, and with but a brief word to Cedarquist, Magnus and Harran\nwent down the marble steps leading to the street door, silent, Harran's\narm tight around his father's shoulder.\n\nAt once the orchestra struck into a lively air. A renewed murmur of\nconversation broke out, and Cedarquist, as he said good-bye to Presley,\nlooked first at the retreating figures of the ranchers, then at the\ngayly dressed throng of beautiful women and debonair young men, and\nindicating the whole scene with a single gesture, said, smiling sadly as\nhe spoke:\n\n“Not a city, Presley, not a city, but a Midway Plaisance.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nUnderneath the Long Trestle where Broderson Creek cut the line of the\nrailroad and the Upper Road, the ground was low and covered with a\nsecond growth of grey green willows. Along the borders of the creek were\noccasional marshy spots, and now and then Hilma Tree came here to gather\nwater-cresses, which she made into salads.\n\nThe place was picturesque, secluded, an oasis of green shade in all the\nlimitless, flat monotony of the surrounding wheat lands. The creek had\neroded deep into the little gully, and no matter how hot it was on the\nbaking, shimmering levels of the ranches above, down here one always\nfound one's self enveloped in an odorous, moist coolness. From time to\ntime, the incessant murmur of the creek, pouring over and around the\nlarger stones, was interrupted by the thunder of trains roaring out\nupon the trestle overhead, passing on with the furious gallop of their\nhundreds of iron wheels, leaving in the air a taint of hot oil, acrid\nsmoke, and reek of escaping steam.\n\nOn a certain afternoon, in the spring of the year, Hilma was returning\nto Quien Sabe from Hooven's by the trail that led from Los Muertos to\nAnnixter's ranch houses, under the trestle. She had spent the afternoon\nwith Minna Hooven, who, for the time being, was kept indoors because of\na wrenched ankle. As Hilma descended into the gravel flats and thickets\nof willows underneath the trestle, she decided that she would gather\nsome cresses for her supper that night. She found a spot around the base\nof one of the supports of the trestle where the cresses grew thickest,\nand plucked a couple of handfuls, washing them in the creek and pinning\nthem up in her handkerchief. It made a little, round, cold bundle, and\nHilma, warm from her walk, found a delicious enjoyment in pressing the\ndamp ball of it to her cheeks and neck.\n\nFor all the change that Annixter had noted in her upon the occasion of\nthe barn dance, Hilma remained in many things a young child. She was\nnever at loss for enjoyment, and could always amuse herself when left\nalone. Just now, she chose to drink from the creek, lying prone on the\nground, her face half-buried in the water, and this, not because she was\nthirsty, but because it was a new way to drink. She imagined herself a\nbelated traveller, a poor girl, an outcast, quenching her thirst at the\nwayside brook, her little packet of cresses doing duty for a bundle of\nclothes. Night was coming on. Perhaps it would storm. She had nowhere to\ngo. She would apply at a hut for shelter.\n\nAbruptly, the temptation to dabble her feet in the creek presented\nitself to her. Always she had liked to play in the water. What a delight\nnow to take off her shoes and stockings and wade out into the shallows\nnear the bank! She had worn low shoes that afternoon, and the dust of\nthe trail had filtered in above the edges. At times, she felt the grit\nand grey sand on the soles of her feet, and the sensation had set\nher teeth on edge. What a delicious alternative the cold, clean water\nsuggested, and how easy it would be to do as she pleased just then, if\nonly she were a little girl. In the end, it was stupid to be grown up.\n\nSitting upon the bank, one finger tucked into the heel of her shoe,\nHilma hesitated. Suppose a train should come! She fancied she could see\nthe engineer leaning from the cab with a great grin on his face, or the\nbrakeman shouting gibes at her from the platform. Abruptly she blushed\nscarlet. The blood throbbed in her temples. Her heart beat. Since the\nfamous evening of the barn dance, Annixter had spoken to her but twice.\nHilma no longer looked after the ranch house these days. The thought of\nsetting foot within Annixter's dining-room and bed-room terrified her,\nand in the end her mother had taken over that part of her work. Of the\ntwo meetings with the master of Quien Sabe, one had been a mere exchange\nof good mornings as the two happened to meet over by the artesian well;\nthe other, more complicated, had occurred in the dairy-house again,\nAnnixter, pretending to look over the new cheese press, asking about\ndetails of her work. When this had happened on that previous occasion,\nending with Annixter's attempt to kiss her, Hilma had been talkative\nenough, chattering on from one subject to another, never at a loss for a\ntheme. But this last time was a veritable ordeal. No sooner had\nAnnixter appeared than her heart leaped and quivered like that of the\nhound-harried doe. Her speech failed her. Throughout the whole brief\ninterview she had been miserably tongue-tied, stammering monosyllables,\nconfused, horribly awkward, and when Annixter had gone away, she had\nfled to her little room, and bolting the door, had flung herself face\ndownward on the bed and wept as though her heart were breaking, she did\nnot know why.\n\nThat Annixter had been overwhelmed with business all through the winter\nwas an inexpressible relief to Hilma. His affairs took him away from the\nranch continually. He was absent sometimes for weeks, making trips\nto San Francisco, or to Sacramento, or to Bonneville. Perhaps he was\nforgetting her, overlooking her; and while, at first, she told herself\nthat she asked nothing better, the idea of it began to occupy her mind.\nShe began to wonder if it was really so.\n\nShe knew his trouble. Everybody did. The news of the sudden forward\nmovement of the Railroad's forces, inaugurating the campaign, had flared\nwhite-hot and blazing all over the country side. To Hilma's notion,\nAnnixter's attitude was heroic beyond all expression. His courage in\nfacing the Railroad, as he had faced Delaney in the barn, seemed to her\nthe pitch of sublimity. She refused to see any auxiliaries aiding him in\nhis fight. To her imagination, the great League, which all the ranchers\nwere joining, was a mere form. Single-handed, Annixter fronted the\nmonster. But for him the corporation would gobble Quien Sabe, as a\nwhale would a minnow. He was a hero who stood between them all and\ndestruction. He was a protector of her family. He was her champion.\nShe began to mention him in her prayers every night, adding a further\npetition to the effect that he would become a good man, and that he\nshould not swear so much, and that he should never meet Delaney again.\n\nHowever, as Hilma still debated the idea of bathing her feet in the\ncreek, a train did actually thunder past overhead--the regular evening\nOverland,--the through express, that never stopped between Bakersfield\nand Fresno. It stormed by with a deafening clamour, and a swirl of\nsmoke, in a long succession of way-coaches, and chocolate coloured\nPullmans, grimy with the dust of the great deserts of the Southwest.\nThe quivering of the trestle's supports set a tremble in the ground\nunderfoot. The thunder of wheels drowned all sound of the flowing of the\ncreek, and also the noise of the buckskin mare's hoofs descending from\nthe trail upon the gravel about the creek, so that Hilma, turning about\nafter the passage of the train, saw Annixter close at hand, with the\nabruptness of a vision.\n\nHe was looking at her, smiling as he rarely did, the firm line of his\nout-thrust lower lip relaxed good-humouredly. He had taken off his\ncampaign hat to her, and though his stiff, yellow hair was twisted\ninto a bristling mop, the little persistent tuft on the crown, usually\ndefiantly erect as an Apache's scalp-lock, was nowhere in sight.\n\n“Hello, it's you, is it, Miss Hilma?” he exclaimed, getting down from\nthe buckskin, and allowing her to drink.\n\nHilma nodded, scrambling to her feet, dusting her skirt with nervous\npats of both hands.\n\nAnnixter sat down on a great rock close by and, the loop of the bridle\nover his arm, lit a cigar, and began to talk. He complained of the heat\nof the day, the bad condition of the Lower Road, over which he had come\non his way from a committee meeting of the League at Los Muertos; of\nthe slowness of the work on the irrigating ditch, and, as a matter of\ncourse, of the general hard times.\n\n“Miss Hilma,” he said abruptly, “never you marry a ranchman. He's never\nout of trouble.”\n\nHilma gasped, her eyes widening till the full round of the pupil was\ndisclosed. Instantly, a certain, inexplicable guiltiness overpowered her\nwith incredible confusion. Her hands trembled as she pressed the bundle\nof cresses into a hard ball between her palms.\n\nAnnixter continued to talk. He was disturbed and excited himself at\nthis unexpected meeting. Never through all the past winter months of\nstrenuous activity, the fever of political campaigns, the harrowing\ndelays and ultimate defeat in one law court after another, had he\nforgotten the look in Hilma's face as he stood with one arm around\nher on the floor of his barn, in peril of his life from the buster's\nrevolver. That dumb confession of Hilma's wide-open eyes had been enough\nfor him. Yet, somehow, he never had had a chance to act upon it. During\nthe short period when he could be on his ranch Hilma had always managed\nto avoid him. Once, even, she had spent a month, about Christmas time,\nwith her mother's father, who kept a hotel in San Francisco.\n\nNow, to-day, however, he had her all to himself. He would put an end\nto the situation that troubled him, and vexed him, day after day,\nmonth after month. Beyond question, the moment had come for something\ndefinite, he could not say precisely what. Readjusting his cigar between\nhis teeth, he resumed his speech. It suited his humour to take the girl\ninto his confidence, following an instinct which warned him that this\nwould bring about a certain closeness of their relations, a certain\nintimacy.\n\n“What do you think of this row, anyways, Miss Hilma,--this railroad\nfuss in general? Think Shelgrim and his rushers are going to jump Quien\nSabe--are going to run us off the ranch?”\n\n“Oh, no, sir,” protested Hilma, still breathless. “Oh, no, indeed not.”\n\n“Well, what then?”\n\nHilma made a little uncertain movement of ignorance.\n\n“I don't know what.”\n\n“Well, the League agreed to-day that if the test cases were lost in\nthe Supreme Court--you know we've appealed to the Supreme Court, at\nWashington--we'd fight.”\n\n“Fight?”\n\n“Yes, fight.”\n\n“Fight like--like you and Mr. Delaney that time with--oh, dear--with\nguns?”\n\n“I don't know,” grumbled Annixter vaguely. “What do YOU think?”\n\nHilma's low-pitched, almost husky voice trembled a little as she\nreplied, “Fighting--with guns--that's so terrible. Oh, those revolvers\nin the barn! I can hear them yet. Every shot seemed like the explosion\nof tons of powder.”\n\n“Shall we clear out, then? Shall we let Delaney have possession, and S.\nBehrman, and all that lot? Shall we give in to them?”\n\n“Never, never,” she exclaimed, her great eyes flashing.\n\n“YOU wouldn't like to be turned out of your home, would you, Miss Hilma,\nbecause Quien Sabe is your home isn't it? You've lived here ever since\nyou were as big as a minute. You wouldn't like to have S. Behrman and\nthe rest of 'em turn you out?”\n\n“N-no,” she murmured. “No, I shouldn't like that. There's mamma and----”\n\n“Well, do you think for one second I'm going to let 'em?” cried\nAnnixter, his teeth tightening on his cigar. “You stay right where\nyou are. I'll take care of you, right enough. Look here,” he demanded\nabruptly, “you've no use for that roaring lush, Delaney, have you?”\n “I think he is a wicked man,” she declared. “I know the Railroad has\npretended to sell him part of the ranch, and he lets Mr. S. Behrman and\nMr. Ruggles just use him.”\n\n“Right. I thought you wouldn't be keen on him.”\n\nThere was a long pause. The buckskin began blowing among the pebbles,\nnosing for grass, and Annixter shifted his cigar to the other corner of\nhis mouth.\n\n“Pretty place,” he muttered, looking around him. Then he added: “Miss\nHilma, see here, I want to have a kind of talk with you, if you don't\nmind. I don't know just how to say these sort of things, and if I get\nall balled up as I go along, you just set it down to the fact that I've\nnever had any experience in dealing with feemale girls; understand? You\nsee, ever since the barn dance--yes, and long before then--I've been\nthinking a lot about you. Straight, I have, and I guess you know it.\nYou're about the only girl that I ever knew well, and I guess,” he\ndeclared deliberately, “you're about the only one I want to know.\nIt's my nature. You didn't say anything that time when we stood there\ntogether and Delaney was playing the fool, but, somehow, I got the idea\nthat you didn't want Delaney to do for me one little bit; that if he'd\ngot me then you would have been sorrier than if he'd got any one else.\nWell, I felt just that way about you. I would rather have had him shoot\nany other girl in the room than you; yes, or in the whole State. Why, if\nanything should happen to you, Miss Hilma--well, I wouldn't care to go\non with anything. S. Behrman could jump Quien Sabe, and welcome. And\nDelaney could shoot me full of holes whenever he got good and ready.\nI'd quit. I'd lay right down. I wouldn't care a whoop about anything any\nmore. You are the only girl for me in the whole world. I didn't think so\nat first. I didn't want to. But seeing you around every day, and seeing\nhow pretty you were, and how clever, and hearing your voice and all,\nwhy, it just got all inside of me somehow, and now I can't think of\nanything else. I hate to go to San Francisco, or Sacramento, or Visalia,\nor even Bonneville, for only a day, just because you aren't there, in\nany of those places, and I just rush what I've got to do so as I can\nget back here. While you were away that Christmas time, why, I was as\nlonesome as--oh, you don't know anything about it. I just scratched off\nthe days on the calendar every night, one by one, till you got back.\nAnd it just comes to this, I want you with me all the time. I want you\nshould have a home that's my home, too. I want to take care of you, and\nhave you all for myself, you understand. What do you say?”\n\nHilma, standing up before him, retied a knot in her handkerchief bundle\nwith elaborate precaution, blinking at it through her tears.\n\n“What do you say, Miss Hilma?” Annixter repeated. “How about that? What\ndo you say?”\n\nJust above a whisper, Hilma murmured:\n\n“I--I don't know.”\n\n“Don't know what? Don't you think we could hit it off together?”\n\n“I don't know.”\n\n“I know we could, Hilma. I don't mean to scare you. What are you crying\nfor?” “I don't know.”\n\nAnnixter got up, cast away his cigar, and dropping the buckskin's\nbridle, came and stood beside her, putting a hand on her shoulder. Hilma\ndid not move, and he felt her trembling. She still plucked at the knot\nof the handkerchief. “I can't do without you, little girl,” Annixter\ncontinued, “and I want you. I want you bad. I don't get much fun out of\nlife ever. It, sure, isn't my nature, I guess. I'm a hard man. Everybody\nis trying to down me, and now I'm up against the Railroad. I'm fighting\n'em all, Hilma, night and day, lock, stock, and barrel, and I'm fighting\nnow for my home, my land, everything I have in the world. If I win out,\nI want somebody to be glad with me. If I don't--I want somebody to be\nsorry for me, sorry with me,--and that somebody is you. I am dog-tired\nof going it alone. I want some one to back me up. I want to feel you\nalongside of me, to give me a touch of the shoulder now and then. I'm\ntired of fighting for THINGS--land, property, money. I want to fight for\nsome PERSON--somebody beside myself. Understand? want to feel that it\nisn't all selfishness--that there are other interests than mine in the\ngame--that there's some one dependent on me, and that's thinking of me\nas I'm thinking of them--some one I can come home to at night and put my\narm around--like this, and have her put her two arms around me--like--”\n He paused a second, and once again, as it had been in that moment\nof imminent peril, when he stood with his arm around her, their eyes\nmet,--“put her two arms around me,” prompted Annixter, half smiling,\n“like--like what, Hilma?”\n\n“I don't know.”\n\n“Like what, Hilma?” he insisted.\n\n“Like--like this?” she questioned. With a movement of infinite\ntenderness and affection she slid her arms around his neck, still crying\na little.\n\nThe sensation of her warm body in his embrace, the feeling of her\nsmooth, round arm, through the thinness of her sleeve, pressing against\nhis cheek, thrilled Annixter with a delight such as he had never known.\nHe bent his head and kissed her upon the nape of her neck, where the\ndelicate amber tint melted into the thick, sweet smelling mass of her\ndark brown hair. She shivered a little, holding him closer, ashamed\nas yet to look up. Without speech, they stood there for a long minute,\nholding each other close. Then Hilma pulled away from him, mopping her\ntear-stained cheeks with the little moist ball of her handkerchief.\n\n“What do you say? Is it a go?” demanded Annixter jovially.\n\n“I thought I hated you all the time,” she said, and the velvety\nhuskiness of her voice never sounded so sweet to him.\n\n“And I thought it was that crockery smashing goat of a lout of a\ncow-puncher.”\n\n“Delaney? The idea! Oh, dear! I think it must always have been you.”\n\n“Since when, Hilma?” he asked, putting his arm around her. “Ah, but it\nis good to have you, my girl,” he exclaimed, delighted beyond words that\nshe permitted this freedom. “Since when? Tell us all about it.”\n\n“Oh, since always. It was ever so long before I came to think of\nyou--to, well, to think about--I mean to remember--oh, you know what I\nmean. But when I did, oh, THEN!”\n\n“Then what?”\n\n“I don't know--I haven't thought--that way long enough to know.”\n\n“But you said you thought it must have been me always.”\n\n“I know; but that was different--oh, I'm all mixed up. I'm so nervous\nand trembly now. Oh,” she cried suddenly, her face overcast with a look\nof earnestness and great seriousness, both her hands catching at his\nwrist, “Oh, you WILL be good to me, now, won't you? I'm only a little,\nlittle child in so many ways, and I've given myself to you, all in a\nminute, and I can't go back of it now, and it's for always. I don't know\nhow it happened or why. Sometimes I think I didn't wish it, but now it's\ndone, and I am glad and happy. But NOW if you weren't good to me--oh,\nthink of how it would be with me. You are strong, and big, and rich, and\nI am only a servant of yours, a little nobody, but I've given all I had\nto you--myself--and you must be so good to me now. Always remember\nthat. Be good to me and be gentle and kind to me in LITTLE things,--in\neverything, or you will break my heart.”\n\nAnnixter took her in his arms. He was speechless. No words that he had\nat his command seemed adequate. All he could say was:\n\n“That's all right, little girl. Don't you be frightened. I'll take care\nof you. That's all right, that's all right.”\n\nFor a long time they sat there under the shade of the great trestle,\ntheir arms about each other, speaking only at intervals. An hour passed.\nThe buckskin, finding no feed to her taste, took the trail stablewards,\nthe bridle dragging. Annixter let her go. Rather than to take his arm\nfrom around Hilma's waist he would have lost his whole stable. At last,\nhowever, he bestirred himself and began to talk. He thought it time to\nformulate some plan of action.\n\n“Well, now, Hilma, what are we going to do?”\n\n“Do?” she repeated. “Why, must we do anything? Oh, isn't this enough?”\n\n“There's better ahead,” he went on. “I want to fix you up somewhere\nwhere you can have a bit of a home all to yourself. Let's see;\nBonneville wouldn't do. There's always a lot of yaps about there\nthat know us, and they would begin to cackle first off. How about San\nFrancisco. We might go up next week and have a look around. I would find\nrooms you could take somewheres, and we would fix 'em up as lovely as\nhow-do-you-do.”\n\n“Oh, but why go away from Quien Sabe?” she protested. “And, then, so\nsoon, too. Why must we have a wedding trip, now that you are so busy?\nWouldn't it be better--oh, I tell you, we could go to Monterey after\nwe were married, for a little week, where mamma's people live, and then\ncome back here to the ranch house and settle right down where we are and\nlet me keep house for you. I wouldn't even want a single servant.”\n\nAnnixter heard and his face grew troubled.\n\n“Hum,” he said, “I see.”\n\nHe gathered up a handful of pebbles and began snapping them carefully\ninto the creek. He fell thoughtful. Here was a phase of the affair he\nhad not planned in the least. He had supposed all the time that Hilma\ntook his meaning. His old suspicion that she was trying to get a hold on\nhim stirred again for a moment. There was no good of such talk as\nthat. Always these feemale girls seemed crazy to get married, bent on\ncomplicating the situation.\n\n“Isn't that best?” said Hilma, glancing at him.\n\n“I don't know,” he muttered gloomily.\n\n“Well, then, let's not. Let's come right back to Quien Sabe without\ngoing to Monterey. Anything that you want I want.”\n\n“I hadn't thought of it in just that way,” he observed.\n\n“In what way, then?”\n\n“Can't we--can't we wait about this marrying business?”\n\n“That's just it,” she said gayly. “I said it was too soon. There would\nbe so much to do between whiles. Why not say at the end of the summer?”\n\n“Say what?”\n\n“Our marriage, I mean.”\n\n“Why get married, then? What's the good of all that fuss about it? I\ndon't go anything upon a minister puddling round in my affairs. What's\nthe difference, anyhow? We understand each other. Isn't that enough?\nPshaw, Hilma, I'M no marrying man.”\n\nShe looked at him a moment, bewildered, then slowly she took his\nmeaning. She rose to her feet, her eyes wide, her face paling with\nterror. He did not look at her, but he could hear the catch in her\nthroat.\n\n“Oh!” she exclaimed, with a long, deep breath, and again “Oh!” the back\nof her hand against her lips.\n\nIt was a quick gasp of a veritable physical anguish. Her eyes brimmed\nover. Annixter rose, looking at her.\n\n“Well?” he said, awkwardly, “Well?”\n\nHilma leaped back from him with an instinctive recoil of her whole\nbeing, throwing out her hands in a gesture of defence, fearing she knew\nnot what. There was as yet no sense of insult in her mind, no outraged\nmodesty. She was only terrified. It was as though searching for wild\nflowers she had come suddenly upon a snake.\n\nShe stood for an instant, spellbound, her eyes wide, her bosom swelling;\nthen, all at once, turned and fled, darting across the plank that\nserved for a foot bridge over the creek, gaining the opposite bank and\ndisappearing with a brisk rustle of underbrush, such as might have been\nmade by the flight of a frightened fawn.\n\nAbruptly Annixter found himself alone. For a moment he did not move,\nthen he picked up his campaign hat, carefully creased its limp crown and\nput it on his head and stood for a moment, looking vaguely at the ground\non both sides of him. He went away without uttering a word, without\nchange of countenance, his hands in his pockets, his feet taking great\nstrides along the trail in the direction of the ranch house.\n\nHe had no sight of Hilma again that evening, and the next morning he\nwas up early and did not breakfast at the ranch house. Business of the\nLeague called him to Bonneville to confer with Magnus and the firm of\nlawyers retained by the League to fight the land-grabbing cases. An\nappeal was to be taken to the Supreme Court at Washington, and it was to\nbe settled that day which of the cases involved should be considered as\ntest cases.\n\nInstead of driving or riding into Bonneville, as he usually did,\nAnnixter took an early morning train, the Bakersfield-Fresno local at\nGuadalajara, and went to Bonneville by rail, arriving there at twenty\nminutes after seven and breakfasting by appointment with Magnus Derrick\nand Osterman at the Yosemite House, on Main Street.\n\nThe conference of the committee with the lawyers took place in a front\nroom of the Yosemite, one of the latter bringing with him his clerk, who\nmade a stenographic report of the proceedings and took carbon copies\nof all letters written. The conference was long and complicated, the\nbusiness transacted of the utmost moment, and it was not until two\no'clock that Annixter found himself at liberty.\n\nHowever, as he and Magnus descended into the lobby of the hotel, they\nwere aware of an excited and interested group collected about the swing\ndoors that opened from the lobby of the Yosemite into the bar of the\nsame name. Dyke was there--even at a distance they could hear the\nreverberation of his deep-toned voice, uplifted in wrath and furious\nexpostulation. Magnus and Annixter joined the group wondering, and all\nat once fell full upon the first scene of a drama.\n\nThat same morning Dyke's mother had awakened him according to his\ninstructions at daybreak. A consignment of his hop poles from the north\nhad arrived at the freight office of the P. and S. W. in Bonneville, and\nhe was to drive in on his farm wagon and bring them out. He would have a\nbusy day.\n\n“Hello, hello,” he said, as his mother pulled his ear to arouse him;\n“morning, mamma.”\n\n“It's time,” she said, “after five already. Your breakfast is on the\nstove.”\n\nHe took her hand and kissed it with great affection. He loved his mother\ndevotedly, quite as much as he did the little tad. In their little\ncottage, in the forest of green hops that surrounded them on every hand,\nthe three led a joyous and secluded life, contented, industrious, happy,\nasking nothing better. Dyke, himself, was a big-hearted, jovial man who\nspread an atmosphere of good-humour wherever he went. In the evenings he\nplayed with Sidney like a big boy, an older brother, lying on the bed,\nor the sofa, taking her in his arms. Between them they had invented a\ngreat game. The ex-engineer, his boots removed, his huge legs in the\nair, hoisted the little tad on the soles of his stockinged feet like a\ncircus acrobat, dandling her there, pretending he was about to let\nher fall. Sidney, choking with delight, held on nervously, with little\nscreams and chirps of excitement, while he shifted her gingerly from one\nfoot to another, and thence, the final act, the great gallery play, to\nthe palm of one great hand. At this point Mrs. Dyke was called in, both\nfather and daughter, children both, crying out that she was to come in\nand look, look. She arrived out of breath from the kitchen, the potato\nmasher in her hand. “Such children,” she murmured, shaking her head at\nthem, amused for all that, tucking the potato masher under her arm and\nclapping her hands. In the end, it was part of the game that Sidney\nshould tumble down upon Dyke, whereat he invariably vented a great\nbellow as if in pain, declaring that his ribs were broken. Gasping, his\neyes shut, he pretended to be in the extreme of dissolution--perhaps\nhe was dying. Sidney, always a little uncertain, amused but distressed,\nshook him nervously, tugging at his beard, pushing open his eyelid with\none finger, imploring him not to frighten her, to wake up and be good.\n\nOn this occasion, while yet he was half-dressed, Dyke tiptoed into his\nmother's room to look at Sidney fast asleep in her little iron cot, her\narm under her head, her lips parted. With infinite precaution he kissed\nher twice, and then finding one little stocking, hung with its mate very\nneatly over the back of a chair, dropped into it a dime, rolled up in a\nwad of paper. He winked all to himself and went out again, closing the\ndoor with exaggerated carefulness.\n\nHe breakfasted alone, Mrs. Dyke pouring his coffee and handing him his\nplate of ham and eggs, and half an hour later took himself off in his\nspringless, skeleton wagon, humming a tune behind his beard and cracking\nthe whip over the backs of his staid and solid farm horses.\n\nThe morning was fine, the sun just coming up. He left Guadalajara,\nsleeping and lifeless, on his left, and going across lots, over an\nangle of Quien Sabe, came out upon the Upper Road, a mile below the\nLong Trestle. He was in great spirits, looking about him over the brown\nfields, ruddy with the dawn. Almost directly in front of him, but far\noff, the gilded dome of the court-house at Bonneville was glinting\nradiant in the first rays of the sun, while a few miles distant,\ntoward the north, the venerable campanile of the Mission San Juan stood\nsilhouetted in purplish black against the flaming east. As he proceeded,\nthe great farm horses jogging forward, placid, deliberate, the country\nside waked to another day. Crossing the irrigating ditch further on, he\nmet a gang of Portuguese, with picks and shovels over their shoulders,\njust going to work. Hooven, already abroad, shouted him a “Goot mornun”\n from behind the fence of Los Muertos. Far off, toward the southwest,\nin the bare expanse of the open fields, where a clump of eucalyptus\nand cypress trees set a dark green note, a thin stream of smoke rose\nstraight into the air from the kitchen of Derrick's ranch houses.\n\nBut a mile or so beyond the Long Trestle he was surprised to see Magnus\nDerrick's protege, the one-time shepherd, Vanamee, coming across Quien\nSabe, by a trail from one of Annixter's division houses. Without knowing\nexactly why, Dyke received the impression that the young man had not\nbeen in bed all of that night.\n\nAs the two approached each other, Dyke eyed the young fellow. He was\ndistrustful of Vanamee, having the country-bred suspicion of any person\nhe could not understand. Vanamee was, beyond doubt, no part of the life\nof ranch and country town. He was an alien, a vagabond, a strange fellow\nwho came and went in mysterious fashion, making no friends, keeping\nto himself. Why did he never wear a hat, why indulge in a fine,\nblack, pointed beard, when either a round beard or a mustache was the\ninvariable custom? Why did he not cut his hair? Above all, why did he\nprowl about so much at night? As the two passed each other, Dyke, for\nall his good-nature, was a little blunt in his greeting and looked back\nat the ex-shepherd over his shoulder.\n\nDyke was right in his suspicion. Vanamee's bed had not been disturbed\nfor three nights. On the Monday of that week he had passed the entire\nnight in the garden of the Mission, overlooking the Seed ranch, in the\nlittle valley. Tuesday evening had found him miles away from that\nspot, in a deep arroyo in the Sierra foothills to the eastward, while\nWednesday he had slept in an abandoned 'dobe on Osterman's stock range,\ntwenty miles from his resting place of the night before.\n\nThe fact of the matter was that the old restlessness had once more\nseized upon Vanamee. Something began tugging at him; the spur of some\nunseen rider touched his flank. The instinct of the wanderer woke and\nmoved. For some time now he had been a part of the Los Muertos staff. On\nQuien Sabe, as on the other ranches, the slack season was at hand. While\nwaiting for the wheat to come up no one was doing much of anything.\nVanamee had come over to Los Muertos and spent most of his days on\nhorseback, riding the range, rounding up and watching the cattle in the\nfourth division of the ranch. But if the vagabond instinct now roused\nitself in the strange fellow's nature, a counter influence had also set\nin. More and more Vanamee frequented the Mission garden after nightfall,\nsometimes remaining there till the dawn began to whiten, lying prone on\nthe ground, his chin on his folded arms, his eyes searching the darkness\nover the little valley of the Seed ranch, watching, watching. As the\ndays went by, he became more reticent than ever. Presley often came to\nfind him on the stock range, a lonely figure in the great wilderness\nof bare, green hillsides, but Vanamee no longer took him into his\nconfidence. Father Sarria alone heard his strange stories.\n\nDyke drove on toward Bonneville, thinking over the whole matter. He\nknew, as every one did in that part of the country, the legend of\nVanamee and Angele, the romance of the Mission garden, the mystery\nof the Other, Vanamee's flight to the deserts of the southwest, his\nperiodic returns, his strange, reticent, solitary character, but, like\nmany another of the country people, he accounted for Vanamee by a short\nand easy method. No doubt, the fellow's wits were turned. That was the\nlong and short of it.\n\nThe ex-engineer reached the Post Office in Bonneville towards eleven\no'clock, but he did not at once present his notice of the arrival of\nhis consignment at Ruggles's office. It entertained him to indulge in an\nhour's lounging about the streets. It was seldom he got into town, and\nwhen he did he permitted himself the luxury of enjoying his evident\npopularity. He met friends everywhere, in the Post Office, in the drug\nstore, in the barber shop and around the court-house. With each one he\nheld a moment's conversation; almost invariably this ended in the same\nway:\n\n“Come on 'n have a drink.”\n\n“Well, I don't care if I do.”\n\nAnd the friends proceeded to the Yosemite bar, pledging each other with\npunctilious ceremony. Dyke, however, was a strictly temperate man.\nHis life on the engine had trained him well. Alcohol he never touched,\ndrinking instead ginger ale, sarsaparilla-and-iron--soft drinks.\n\nAt the drug store, which also kept a stock of miscellaneous stationery,\nhis eye was caught by a “transparent slate,” a child's toy, where upon\na little pane of frosted glass one could trace with considerable\nelaboration outline figures of cows, ploughs, bunches of fruit and even\nrural water mills that were printed on slips of paper underneath.\n\n“Now, there's an idea, Jim,” he observed to the boy behind the\nsoda-water fountain; “I know a little tad that would just about jump out\nof her skin for that. Think I'll have to take it with me.”\n\n“How's Sidney getting along?” the other asked, while wrapping up the\npackage.\n\nDyke's enthusiasm had made of his little girl a celebrity throughout\nBonneville.\n\nThe ex-engineer promptly became voluble, assertive, doggedly emphatic.\n\n“Smartest little tad in all Tulare County, and more fun! A regular whole\nshow in herself.”\n\n“And the hops?” inquired the other.\n\n“Bully,” declared Dyke, with the good-natured man's readiness to talk of\nhis private affairs to any one who would listen. “Bully. I'm dead sure\nof a bonanza crop by now. The rain came JUST right. I actually don't\nknow as I can store the crop in those barns I built, it's going to be so\nbig. That foreman of mine was a daisy. Jim, I'm going to make money in\nthat deal. After I've paid off the mortgage--you know I had to mortgage,\nyes, crop and homestead both, but I can pay it off and all the interest\nto boot, lovely,--well, and as I was saying, after all expenses are paid\noff I'll clear big money, m' son. Yes, sir. I KNEW there was boodle in\nhops. You know the crop is contracted for already. Sure, the foreman\nmanaged that. He's a daisy. Chap in San Francisco will take it all and\nat the advanced price. I wanted to hang on, to see if it wouldn't go to\nsix cents, but the foreman said, 'No, that's good enough.' So I signed.\nAin't it bully, hey?”\n\n“Then what'll you do?”\n\n“Well, I don't know. I'll have a lay-off for a month or so and take the\nlittle tad and mother up and show 'em the city--'Frisco--until it's\ntime for the schools to open, and then we'll put Sid in the seminary at\nMarysville. Catch on?”\n\n“I suppose you'll stay right by hops now?”\n\n“Right you are, m'son. I know a good thing when I see it. There's plenty\nothers going into hops next season. I set 'em the example. Wouldn't be\nsurprised if it came to be a regular industry hereabouts. I'm planning\nahead for next year already. I can let the foreman go, now that I've\nlearned the game myself, and I think I'll buy a piece of land off Quien\nSabe and get a bigger crop, and build a couple more barns, and, by\nGeorge, in about five years time I'll have things humming. I'm going to\nmake MONEY, Jim.”\n\nHe emerged once more into the street and went up the block leisurely,\nplanting his feet squarely. He fancied that he could feel he was\nconsidered of more importance nowadays. He was no longer a subordinate,\nan employee. He was his own man, a proprietor, an owner of land,\nfurthering a successful enterprise. No one had helped him; he had\nfollowed no one's lead. He had struck out unaided for himself, and his\nsuccess was due solely to his own intelligence, industry, and foresight.\nHe squared his great shoulders till the blue gingham of his jumper all\nbut cracked. Of late, his great blond beard had grown and the work in\nthe sun had made his face very red. Under the visor of his cap--relic of\nhis engineering days--his blue eyes twinkled with vast good-nature. He\nfelt that he made a fine figure as he went by a group of young girls in\nlawns and muslins and garden hats on their way to the Post Office. He\nwondered if they looked after him, wondered if they had heard that he\nwas in a fair way to become a rich man.\n\nBut the chronometer in the window of the jewelry store warned him that\ntime was passing. He turned about, and, crossing the street, took his\nway to Ruggles's office, which was the freight as well as the land\noffice of the P. and S. W. Railroad.\n\nAs he stood for a moment at the counter in front of the wire partition,\nwaiting for the clerk to make out the order for the freight agent at the\ndepot, Dyke was surprised to see a familiar figure in conference with\nRuggles himself, by a desk inside the railing.\n\nThe figure was that of a middle-aged man, fat, with a great stomach,\nwhich he stroked from time to time. As he turned about, addressing a\nremark to the clerk, Dyke recognised S. Behrman. The banker, railroad\nagent, and political manipulator seemed to the ex-engineer's eyes to be\nmore gross than ever. His smooth-shaven jowl stood out big and tremulous\non either side of his face; the roll of fat on the nape of his neck,\nsprinkled with sparse, stiff hairs, bulged out with greater prominence.\nHis great stomach, covered with a light brown linen vest, stamped with\ninnumerable interlocked horseshoes, protruded far in advance, enormous,\naggressive. He wore his inevitable round-topped hat of stiff brown\nstraw, varnished so bright that it reflected the light of the office\nwindows like a helmet, and even from where he stood Dyke could hear his\nloud breathing and the clink of the hollow links of his watch chain upon\nthe vest buttons of imitation pearl, as his stomach rose and fell.\n\nDyke looked at him with attention. There was the enemy, the\nrepresentative of the Trust with which Derrick's League was locking\nhorns. The great struggle had begun to invest the combatants with\ninterest. Daily, almost hourly, Dyke was in touch with the ranchers,\nthe wheat-growers. He heard their denunciations, their growls of\nexasperation and defiance. Here was the other side--this placid, fat\nman, with a stiff straw hat and linen vest, who never lost his\ntemper, who smiled affably upon his enemies, giving them good advice,\ncommiserating with them in one defeat after another, never ruffled,\nnever excited, sure of his power, conscious that back of him was the\nMachine, the colossal force, the inexhaustible coffers of a mighty\norganisation, vomiting millions to the League's thousands.\n\nThe League was clamorous, ubiquitous, its objects known to every urchin\non the streets, but the Trust was silent, its ways inscrutable, the\npublic saw only results. It worked on in the dark, calm, disciplined,\nirresistible. Abruptly Dyke received the impression of the multitudinous\nramifications of the colossus. Under his feet the ground seemed mined;\ndown there below him in the dark the huge tentacles went silently\ntwisting and advancing, spreading out in every direction, sapping the\nstrength of all opposition, quiet, gradual, biding the time to reach up\nand out and grip with a sudden unleashing of gigantic strength.\n\n“I'll be wanting some cars of you people before the summer is out,”\n observed Dyke to the clerk as he folded up and put away the order that\nthe other had handed him. He remembered perfectly well that he had\narranged the matter of transporting his crop some months before, but\nhis role of proprietor amused him and he liked to busy himself again and\nagain with the details of his undertaking.\n\n“I suppose,” he added, “you'll be able to give 'em to me. There'll be\na big wheat crop to move this year and I don't want to be caught in any\ncar famine.”\n\n“Oh, you'll get your cars,” murmured the other.\n\n“I'll be the means of bringing business your way,” Dyke went on; “I've\ndone so well with my hops that there are a lot of others going into\nthe business next season. Suppose,” he continued, struck with an\nidea, “suppose we went into some sort of pool, a sort of shippers'\norganisation, could you give us special rates, cheaper rates--say a cent\nand a half?”\n\nThe other looked up.\n\n“A cent and a half! Say FOUR cents and a half and maybe I'll talk\nbusiness with you.”\n\n“Four cents and a half,” returned Dyke, “I don't see it. Why, the\nregular rate is only two cents.”\n\n“No, it isn't,” answered the clerk, looking him gravely in the eye,\n“it's five cents.”\n\n“Well, there's where you are wrong, m'son,” Dyke retorted, genially.\n“You look it up. You'll find the freight on hops from Bonneville\nto 'Frisco is two cents a pound for car load lots. You told me that\nyourself last fall.”\n\n“That was last fall,” observed the clerk. There was a silence. Dyke shot\na glance of suspicion at the other. Then, reassured, he remarked:\n\n“You look it up. You'll see I'm right.”\n\nS. Behrman came forward and shook hands politely with the ex-engineer.\n\n“Anything I can do for you, Mr. Dyke?”\n\nDyke explained. When he had done speaking, the clerk turned to S.\nBehrman and observed, respectfully:\n\n“Our regular rate on hops is five cents.”\n\n“Yes,” answered S. Behrman, pausing to reflect; “yes, Mr. Dyke, that's\nright--five cents.”\n\nThe clerk brought forward a folder of yellow paper and handed it\nto Dyke. It was inscribed at the top “Tariff Schedule No. 8,” and\nunderneath these words, in brackets, was a smaller inscription,\n“SUPERSEDES NO. 7 OF AUG. 1”\n\n“See for yourself,” said S. Behrman. He indicated an item under the head\nof “Miscellany.”\n\n“The following rates for carriage of hops in car load lots,” read Dyke,\n“take effect June 1, and will remain in force until superseded by a\nlater tariff. Those quoted beyond Stockton are subject to changes in\ntraffic arrangements with carriers by water from that point.”\n\nIn the list that was printed below, Dyke saw that the rate for hops\nbetween Bonneville or Guadalajara and San Francisco was five cents.\n\nFor a moment Dyke was confused. Then swiftly the matter became clear in\nhis mind. The Railroad had raised the freight on hops from two cents to\nfive.\n\nAll his calculations as to a profit on his little investment he had\nbased on a freight rate of two cents a pound. He was under contract to\ndeliver his crop. He could not draw back. The new rate ate up every cent\nof his gains. He stood there ruined.\n\n“Why, what do you mean?” he burst out. “You promised me a rate of two\ncents and I went ahead with my business with that understanding. What do\nyou mean?”\n\nS. Behrman and the clerk watched him from the other side of the counter.\n\n“The rate is five cents,” declared the clerk doggedly.\n\n“Well, that ruins me,” shouted Dyke. “Do you understand? I won't make\nfifty cents. MAKE! Why, I will OWE,--I'll be--be--That ruins me, do you\nunderstand?”\n\nThe other, raised a shoulder.\n\n“We don't force you to ship. You can do as you like. The rate is five\ncents.”\n\n“Well--but--damn you, I'm under contract to deliver. What am I going to\ndo? Why, you told me--you promised me a two-cent rate.”\n\n“I don't remember it,” said the clerk. “I don't know anything about\nthat. But I know this; I know that hops have gone up. I know the German\ncrop was a failure and that the crop in New York wasn't worth the\nhauling. Hops have gone up to nearly a dollar. You don't suppose we\ndon't know that, do you, Mr. Dyke?”\n\n“What's the price of hops got to do with you?”\n\n“It's got THIS to do with us,” returned the other with a sudden\naggressiveness, “that the freight rate has gone up to meet the price.\nWe're not doing business for our health. My orders are to raise your\nrate to five cents, and I think you are getting off easy.”\n\nDyke stared in blank astonishment. For the moment, the audacity of\nthe affair was what most appealed to him. He forgot its personal\napplication.\n\n“Good Lord,” he murmured, “good Lord! What will you people do next? Look\nhere. What's your basis of applying freight rates, anyhow?” he suddenly\nvociferated with furious sarcasm. “What's your rule? What are you guided\nby?”\n\nBut at the words, S. Behrman, who had kept silent during the heat of the\ndiscussion, leaned abruptly forward. For the only time in his knowledge,\nDyke saw his face inflamed with anger and with the enmity and contempt\nof all this farming element with whom he was contending.\n\n“Yes, what's your rule? What's your basis?” demanded Dyke, turning\nswiftly to him.\n\nS. Behrman emphasised each word of his reply with a tap of one\nforefinger on the counter before him:\n\n“All--the--traffic--will--bear.”\n\nThe ex-engineer stepped back a pace, his fingers on the ledge of the\ncounter, to steady himself. He felt himself grow pale, his heart became\na mere leaden weight in his chest, inert, refusing to beat.\n\nIn a second the whole affair, in all its bearings, went speeding before\nthe eye of his imagination like the rapid unrolling of a panorama. Every\ncent of his earnings was sunk in this hop business of his. More than\nthat, he had borrowed money to carry it on, certain of success--borrowed\nof S. Behrman, offering his crop and his little home as security. Once\nhe failed to meet his obligations, S. Behrman would foreclose. Not only\nwould the Railroad devour every morsel of his profits, but also it would\ntake from him his home; at a blow he would be left penniless and without\na home. What would then become of his mother--and what would become\nof the little tad? She, whom he had been planning to educate like a\nveritable lady. For all that year he had talked of his ambition for his\nlittle daughter to every one he met. All Bonneville knew of it. What\na mark for gibes he had made of himself. The workingman turned farmer!\nWhat a target for jeers--he who had fancied he could elude the Railroad!\nHe remembered he had once said the great Trust had overlooked his little\nenterprise, disdaining to plunder such small fry. He should have known\nbetter than that. How had he ever imagined the Road would permit him to\nmake any money?\n\nAnger was not in him yet; no rousing of the blind, white-hot wrath that\nleaps to the attack with prehensile fingers, moved him. The blow merely\ncrushed, staggered, confused.\n\nHe stepped aside to give place to a coatless man in a pink shirt, who\nentered, carrying in his hands an automatic door-closing apparatus.\n\n“Where does this go?” inquired the man.\n\nDyke sat down for a moment on a seat that had been removed from a\nworn-out railway car to do duty in Ruggles's office. On the back of a\nyellow envelope he made some vague figures with a stump of blue pencil,\nmultiplying, subtracting, perplexing himself with many errors.\n\nS. Behrman, the clerk, and the man with the door-closing apparatus\ninvolved themselves in a long argument, gazing intently at the top panel\nof the door. The man who had come to fix the apparatus was unwilling to\nguarantee it, unless a sign was put on the outside of the door, warning\nincomers that the door was self-closing. This sign would cost fifteen\ncents extra.\n\n“But you didn't say anything about this when the thing was ordered,”\n declared S. Behrman. “No, I won't pay it, my friend. It's an\novercharge.”\n\n“You needn't think,” observed the clerk, “that just because you are\ndealing with the Railroad you are going to work us.”\n\nGenslinger came in, accompanied by Delaney. S. Behrman and the\nclerk, abruptly dismissing the man with the door-closing machine, put\nthemselves behind the counter and engaged in conversation with these\ntwo. Genslinger introduced Delaney. The buster had a string of horses he\nwas shipping southward. No doubt he had come to make arrangements with\nthe Railroad in the matter of stock cars. The conference of the four men\nwas amicable in the extreme.\n\nDyke, studying the figures on the back of the envelope, came forward\nagain. Absorbed only in his own distress, he ignored the editor and the\ncow-puncher.\n\n“Say,” he hazarded, “how about this? I make out----\n\n“We've told you what our rates are, Mr. Dyke,” exclaimed the clerk\nangrily. “That's all the arrangement we will make. Take it or leave it.”\n He turned again to Genslinger, giving the ex-engineer his back.\n\nDyke moved away and stood for a moment in the centre of the room,\nstaring at the figures on the envelope.\n\n“I don't see,” he muttered, “just what I'm going to do. No, I don't see\nwhat I'm going to do at all.”\n\nRuggles came in, bringing with him two other men in whom Dyke recognised\ndummy buyers of the Los Muertos and Osterman ranchos. They brushed by\nhim, jostling his elbow, and as he went out of the door he heard them\nexchange jovial greetings with Delaney, Genslinger, and S. Behrman.\n\nDyke went down the stairs to the street and proceeded onward aimlessly\nin the direction of the Yosemite House, fingering the yellow envelope\nand looking vacantly at the sidewalk.\n\nThere was a stoop to his massive shoulders. His great arms dangled\nloosely at his sides, the palms of his hands open.\n\nAs he went along, a certain feeling of shame touched him. Surely his\npredicament must be apparent to every passer-by. No doubt, every one\nrecognised the unsuccessful man in the very way he slouched along. The\nyoung girls in lawns, muslins, and garden hats, returning from the Post\nOffice, their hands full of letters, must surely see in him the type of\nthe failure, the bankrupt.\n\nThen brusquely his tardy rage flamed up. By God, NO, it was not his\nfault; he had made no mistake. His energy, industry, and foresight had\nbeen sound. He had been merely the object of a colossal trick, a sordid\ninjustice, a victim of the insatiate greed of the monster, caught and\nchoked by one of those millions of tentacles suddenly reaching up from\nbelow, from out the dark beneath his feet, coiling around his throat,\nthrottling him, strangling him, sucking his blood. For a moment he\nthought of the courts, but instantly laughed at the idea. What court was\nimmune from the power of the monster? Ah, the rage of helplessness, the\nfury of impotence! No help, no hope,--ruined in a brief instant--he a\nveritable giant, built of great sinews, powerful, in the full tide of\nhis manhood, having all his health, all his wits. How could he now\nface his home? How could he tell his mother of this catastrophe?\nAnd Sidney--the little tad; how could he explain to her this\nwretchedness--how soften her disappointment? How keep the tears from\nout her eyes--how keep alive her confidence in him--her faith in his\nresources?\n\nBitter, fierce, ominous, his wrath loomed up in his heart. His fists\ngripped tight together, his teeth clenched. Oh, for a moment to have\nhis hand upon the throat of S. Behrman, wringing the breath from him,\nwrenching out the red life of him--staining the street with the blood\nsucked from the veins of the People!\n\nTo the first friend that he met, Dyke told the tale of the tragedy,\nand to the next, and to the next. The affair went from mouth to mouth,\nspreading with electrical swiftness, overpassing and running ahead of\nDyke himself, so that by the time he reached the lobby of the Yosemite\nHouse, he found his story awaiting him. A group formed about him. In\nhis immediate vicinity business for the instant was suspended. The group\nswelled. One after another of his friends added themselves to it. Magnus\nDerrick joined it, and Annixter. Again and again, Dyke recounted the\nmatter, beginning with the time when he was discharged from the same\ncorporation's service for refusing to accept an unfair wage. His voice\nquivered with exasperation; his heavy frame shook with rage; his eyes\nwere injected, bloodshot; his face flamed vermilion, while his deep\nbass rumbled throughout the running comments of his auditors like the\nthunderous reverberation of diapason.\n\nFrom all points of view, the story was discussed by those who listened\nto him, now in the heat of excitement, now calmly, judicially. One\nverdict, however, prevailed. It was voiced by Annixter: “You're stuck.\nYou can roar till you're black in the face, but you can't buck against\nthe Railroad. There's nothing to be done.” “You can shoot the ruffian,\nyou can shoot S. Behrman,” clamoured one of the group. “Yes, sir; by the\nLord, you can shoot him.”\n\n“Poor fool,” commented Annixter, turning away.\n\nNothing to be done. No, there was nothing to be done--not one thing.\nDyke, at last alone and driving his team out of the town, turned\nthe business confusedly over in his mind from end to end. Advice,\nsuggestion, even offers of financial aid had been showered upon him from\nall directions. Friends were not wanting who heatedly presented to his\nconsideration all manner of ingenious plans, wonderful devices. They\nwere worthless. The tentacle held fast. He was stuck.\n\nBy degrees, as his wagon carried him farther out into the country, and\nopen empty fields, his anger lapsed, and the numbness of bewilderment\nreturned. He could not look one hour ahead into the future; could\nformulate no plans even for the next day. He did not know what to do. He\nwas stuck.\n\nWith the limpness and inertia of a sack of sand, the reins slipping\nloosely in his dangling fingers, his eyes fixed, staring between the\nhorses' heads, he allowed himself to be carried aimlessly along. He\nresigned himself. What did he care? What was the use of going on? He was\nstuck.\n\nThe team he was driving had once belonged to the Los Muertos stables and\nunguided as the horses were, they took the county road towards Derrick's\nranch house. Dyke, all abroad, was unaware of the fact till, drawn\nby the smell of water, the horses halted by the trough in front of\nCaraher's saloon.\n\nThe ex-engineer dismounted, looking about him, realising where he was.\nSo much the worse; it did not matter. Now that he had come so far it was\nas short to go home by this route as to return on his tracks. Slowly he\nunchecked the horses and stood at their heads, watching them drink.\n\n“I don't see,” he muttered, “just what I am going to do.”\n\nCaraher appeared at the door of his place, his red face, red beard, and\nflaming cravat standing sharply out from the shadow of the doorway. He\ncalled a welcome to Dyke.\n\n“Hello, Captain.”\n\nDyke looked up, nodding his head listlessly.\n\n“Hello, Caraher,” he answered.\n\n“Well,” continued the saloonkeeper, coming forward a step, “what's the\nnews in town?”\n\nDyke told him. Caraher's red face suddenly took on a darker colour. The\nred glint in his eyes shot from under his eyebrows. Furious, he vented a\nrolling explosion of oaths.\n\n“And now it's your turn,” he vociferated. “They ain't after only the big\nwheat-growers, the rich men. By God, they'll even pick the poor man's\npocket. Oh, they'll get their bellies full some day. It can't last\nforever. They'll wake up the wrong kind of man some morning, the man\nthat's got guts in him, that will hit back when he's kicked and that\nwill talk to 'em with a torch in one hand and a stick of dynamite in the\nother.” He raised his clenched fists in the air. “So help me, God,”\n he cried, “when I think it all over I go crazy, I see red. Oh, if the\npeople only knew their strength. Oh, if I could wake 'em up. There's not\nonly Shelgrim, but there's others. All the magnates, all the butchers,\nall the blood-suckers, by the thousands. Their day will come, by God, it\nwill.”\n\nBy now, the ex-engineer and the bar-keeper had retired to the saloon\nback of the grocery to talk over the details of this new outrage. Dyke,\nstill a little dazed, sat down by one of the tables, preoccupied, saying\nbut little, and Caraher as a matter of course set the whiskey bottle at\nhis elbow.\n\nIt happened that at this same moment, Presley, returning to Los Muertos\nfrom Bonneville, his pockets full of mail, stopped in at the grocery to\nbuy some black lead for his bicycle. In the saloon, on the other side\nof the narrow partition, he overheard the conversation between Dyke and\nCaraher. The door was open. He caught every word distinctly.\n\n“Tell us all about it, Dyke,” urged Caraher.\n\nFor the fiftieth time Dyke told the story. Already it had crystallised\ninto a certain form. He used the same phrases with each repetition, the\nsame sentences, the same words. In his mind it became set. Thus he would\ntell it to any one who would listen from now on, week after week, year\nafter year, all the rest of his life--“And I based my calculations on a\ntwo-cent rate. So soon as they saw I was to make money they doubled\nthe tariff--all the traffic would bear--and I mortgaged to S.\nBehrman--ruined me with a turn of the hand--stuck, cinched, and not one\nthing to be done.”\n\nAs he talked, he drank glass after glass of whiskey, and the honest\nrage, the open, above-board fury of his mind coagulated, thickened, and\nsunk to a dull, evil hatred, a wicked, oblique malevolence. Caraher,\nsure now of winning a disciple, replenished his glass.\n\n“Do you blame us now,” he cried, “us others, the Reds? Ah, yes, it's\nall very well for your middle class to preach moderation. I could do it,\ntoo. You could do it, too, if your belly was fed, if your property\nwas safe, if your wife had not been murdered if your children were not\nstarving. Easy enough then to preach law-abiding methods, legal redress,\nand all such rot. But how about US?” he vociferated. “Ah, yes, I'm a\nloud-mouthed rum-seller, ain't I? I'm a wild-eyed striker, ain't I?\nI'm a blood-thirsty anarchist, ain't I? Wait till you've seen your\nwife brought home to you with the face you used to kiss smashed in by a\nhorse's hoof--killed by the Trust, as it happened to me. Then talk about\nmoderation! And you, Dyke, black-listed engineer, discharged employee,\nruined agriculturist, wait till you see your little tad and your mother\nturned out of doors when S. Behrman forecloses. Wait till you see 'em\ngetting thin and white, and till you hear your little girl ask you why\nyou all don't eat a little more and that she wants her dinner and you\ncan't give it to her. Wait till you see--at the same time that\nyour family is dying for lack of bread--a hundred thousand acres of\nwheat--millions of bushels of food--grabbed and gobbled by the Railroad\nTrust, and then talk of moderation. That talk is just what the Trust\nwants to hear. It ain't frightened of that. There's one thing only it\ndoes listen to, one thing it is frightened of--the people with dynamite\nin their hands,--six inches of plugged gaspipe. THAT talks.”\n\nDyke did not reply. He filled another pony of whiskey and drank it in\ntwo gulps. His frown had lowered to a scowl, his face was a dark red,\nhis head had sunk, bull-like, between his massive shoulders; without\nwinking he gazed long and with troubled eyes at his knotted, muscular\nhands, lying open on the table before him, idle, their occupation gone.\n\nPresley forgot his black lead. He listened to Caraher. Through the open\ndoor he caught a glimpse of Dyke's back, broad, muscled, bowed down, the\ngreat shoulders stooping.\n\nThe whole drama of the doubled freight rate leaped salient and distinct\nin the eye of his mind. And this was but one instance, an isolated case.\nBecause he was near at hand he happened to see it. How many others were\nthere, the length and breadth of the State? Constantly this sort of\nthing must occur--little industries choked out in their very beginnings,\nthe air full of the death rattles of little enterprises, expiring\nunobserved in far-off counties, up in canyons and arroyos of the\nfoothills, forgotten by every one but the monster who was daunted by the\nmagnitude of no business, however great, who overlooked no opportunity\nof plunder, however petty, who with one tentacle grabbed a hundred\nthousand acres of wheat, and with another pilfered a pocketful of\ngrowing hops.\n\nHe went away without a word, his head bent, his hands clutched tightly\non the cork grips of the handle bars of his bicycle. His lips were\nwhite. In his heart a blind demon of revolt raged tumultuous, shrieking\nblasphemies.\n\nAt Los Muertos, Presley overtook Annixter. As he guided his wheel up the\ndriveway to Derrick's ranch house, he saw the master of Quien Sabe and\nHarran in conversation on the steps of the porch. Magnus stood in the\ndoorway, talking to his wife.\n\nOccupied with the press of business and involved in the final conference\nwith the League's lawyers on the eve of the latter's departure for\nWashington, Annixter had missed the train that was to take him back to\nGuadalajara and Quien Sabe. Accordingly, he had accepted the Governor's\ninvitation to return with him on his buck-board to Los Muertos, and\nbefore leaving Bonneville had telephoned to his ranch to have young\nVacca bring the buckskin, by way of the Lower Road, to meet him at\nLos Muertos. He found her waiting there for him, but before going on,\ndelayed a few moments to tell Harran of Dyke's affair.\n\n“I wonder what he will do now?” observed Harran when his first outburst\nof indignation had subsided.\n\n“Nothing,” declared Annixter. “He's stuck.”\n\n“That eats up every cent of Dyke's earnings,” Harran went on. “He has\nbeen ten years saving them. Oh, I told him to make sure of the Railroad\nwhen he first spoke to me about growing hops.”\n\n“I've just seen him,” said Presley, as he joined the others. “He was at\nCaraher's. I only saw his back. He was drinking at a table and his back\nwas towards me. But the man looked broken--absolutely crushed. It is\nterrible, terrible.”\n\n“He was at Caraher's, was he?” demanded Annixter.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Drinking, hey?”\n\n“I think so. Yes, I saw a bottle.”\n\n“Drinking at Caraher's,” exclaimed Annixter, rancorously; “I can see HIS\nfinish.”\n\nThere was a silence. It seemed as if nothing more was to be said. They\npaused, looking thoughtfully on the ground.\n\nIn silence, grim, bitter, infinitely sad, the three men as if at that\nmoment actually standing in the bar-room of Caraher's roadside saloon,\ncontemplated the slow sinking, the inevitable collapse and submerging\nof one of their companions, the wreck of a career, the ruin of an\nindividual; an honest man, strong, fearless, upright, struck down by a\ncolossal power, perverted by an evil influence, go reeling to his ruin.\n\n“I see his finish,” repeated Annixter. “Exit Dyke, and score another\ntally for S. Behrman, Shelgrim and Co.”\n\nHe moved away impatiently, loosening the tie-rope with which the\nbuckskin was fastened. He swung himself up.\n\n“God for us all,” he declared as he rode away, “and the devil take the\nhindmost. Good-bye, I'm going home. I still have one a little longer.”\n\nHe galloped away along the Lower Road, in the direction of Quien Sabe,\nemerging from the grove of cypress and eucalyptus about the ranch house,\nand coming out upon the bare brown plain of the wheat land, stretching\naway from him in apparent barrenness on either hand.\n\nIt was late in the day, already his shadow was long upon the padded dust\nof the road in front of him. On ahead, a long ways off, and a little to\nthe north, the venerable campanile of the Mission San Juan was glinting\nradiant in the last rays of the sun, while behind him, towards the\nnorth and west, the gilded dome of the courthouse at Bonneville stood\nsilhouetted in purplish black against the flaming west. Annixter spurred\nthe buck-skin forward. He feared he might be late to his supper. He\nwondered if it would be brought to him by Hilma.\n\nHilma! The name struck across in his brain with a pleasant, glowing\ntremour. All through that day of activity, of strenuous business, the\nminute and cautious planning of the final campaign in the great war of\nthe League and the Trust, the idea of her and the recollection of her\nhad been the undercurrent of his thoughts. At last he was alone. He\ncould put all other things behind him and occupy himself solely with\nher.\n\nIn that glory of the day's end, in that chaos of sunshine, he saw her\nagain. Unimaginative, crude, direct, his fancy, nevertheless, placed\nher before him, steeped in sunshine, saturated with glorious light,\nbrilliant, radiant, alluring. He saw the sweet simplicity of her\ncarriage, the statuesque evenness of the contours of her figure, the\nsingle, deep swell of her bosom, the solid masses of her hair. He\nremembered the small contradictory suggestions of feminine daintiness he\nhad so often remarked about her, her slim, narrow feet, the little steel\nbuckles of her low shoes, the knot of black ribbon she had begun to wear\nof late on the back of her head, and he heard her voice, low-pitched,\nvelvety, a sweet, murmuring huskiness that seemed to come more from her\nchest than from her throat.\n\nThe buckskin's hoofs clattered upon the gravelly flats of Broderson's\nCreek underneath the Long Trestle. Annixter's mind went back to the\nscene of the previous evening, when he had come upon her at this place.\nHe set his teeth with anger and disappointment. Why had she not been\nable to understand? What was the matter with these women, always set\nupon this marrying notion? Was it not enough that he wanted her more\nthan any other girl he knew and that she wanted him? She had said as\nmuch. Did she think she was going to be mistress of Quien Sabe? Ah, that\nwas it. She was after his property, was for marrying him because of his\nmoney. His unconquerable suspicion of the woman, his innate distrust\nof the feminine element would not be done away with. What fathomless\nduplicity was hers, that she could appear so innocent. It was almost\nunbelievable; in fact, was it believable?\n\nFor the first time doubt assailed him. Suppose Hilma was indeed all\nthat she appeared to be. Suppose it was not with her a question of his\nproperty, after all; it was a poor time to think of marrying him for his\nproperty when all Quien Sabe hung in the issue of the next few months.\nSuppose she had been sincere. But he caught himself up. Was he to be\nfooled by a feemale girl at this late date? He, Buck Annixter, crafty,\nhard-headed, a man of affairs? Not much. Whatever transpired he would\nremain the master.\n\nHe reached Quien Sabe in this frame of mind. But at this hour, Annixter,\nfor all his resolutions, could no longer control his thoughts. As he\nstripped the saddle from the buckskin and led her to the watering trough\nby the stable corral, his heart was beating thick at the very notion\nof being near Hilma again. It was growing dark, but covertly he glanced\nhere and there out of the corners of his eyes to see if she was anywhere\nabout. Annixter--how, he could not tell--had become possessed of the\nidea that Hilma would not inform her parents of what had passed between\nthem the previous evening under the Long Trestle. He had no idea that\nmatters were at an end between himself and the young woman. He must\napologise, he saw that clearly enough, must eat crow, as he told\nhimself. Well, he would eat crow. He was not afraid of her any longer,\nnow that she had made her confession to him. He would see her as soon as\npossible and get this business straightened out, and begin again from a\nnew starting point. What he wanted with Hilma, Annixter did not define\nclearly in his mind. At one time he had known perfectly well what he\nwanted. Now, the goal of his desires had become vague. He could not say\nexactly what it was. He preferred that things should go forward without\nmuch idea of consequences; if consequences came, they would do so\nnaturally enough, and of themselves; all that he positively knew was\nthat Hilma occupied his thoughts morning, noon, and night; that he was\nhappy when he was with her, and miserable when away from her.\n\nThe Chinese cook served his supper in silence. Annixter ate and drank\nand lighted a cigar, and after his meal sat on the porch of his house,\nsmoking and enjoying the twilight. The evening was beautiful, warm, the\nsky one powder of stars. From the direction of the stables he heard one\nof the Portuguese hands picking a guitar.\n\nBut he wanted to see Hilma. The idea of going to bed without at least a\nglimpse of her became distasteful to him. Annixter got up and descending\nfrom the porch began to walk aimlessly about between the ranch\nbuildings, with eye and ear alert. Possibly he might meet her\nsomewheres.\n\nThe Trees' little house, toward which inevitably Annixter directed\nhis steps, was dark. Had they all gone to bed so soon? He made a\nwide circuit about it, listening, but heard no sound. The door of the\ndairy-house stood ajar. He pushed it open, and stepped into the odorous\ndarkness of its interior. The pans and deep cans of polished metal\nglowed faintly from the corners and from the walls. The smell of new\ncheese was pungent in his nostrils. Everything was quiet. There was\nnobody there. He went out again, closing the door, and stood for a\nmoment in the space between the dairy-house and the new barn, uncertain\nas to what he should do next.\n\nAs he waited there, his foreman came out of the men's bunk house, on the\nother side of the kitchens, and crossed over toward the barn. “Hello,\nBilly,” muttered Annixter as he passed.\n\n“Oh, good evening, Mr. Annixter,” said the other, pausing in front of\nhim. “I didn't know you were back. By the way,” he added, speaking as\nthough the matter was already known to Annixter, “I see old man Tree and\nhis family have left us. Are they going to be gone long? Have they left\nfor good?”\n\n“What's that?” Annixter exclaimed. “When did they go? Did all of them\ngo, all three?”\n\n“Why, I thought you knew. Sure, they all left on the afternoon train for\nSan Francisco. Cleared out in a hurry--took all their trunks. Yes, all\nthree went--the young lady, too. They gave me notice early this morning.\nThey ain't ought to have done that. I don't know who I'm to get to run\nthe dairy on such short notice. Do you know any one, Mr. Annixter?”\n\n“Well, why in hell did you let them go?” vociferated Annixter. “Why\ndidn't you keep them here till I got back? Why didn't you find out if\nthey were going for good? I can't be everywhere. What do I feed you for\nif it ain't to look after things I can't attend to?”\n\nHe turned on his heel and strode away straight before him, not caring\nwhere he was going. He tramped out from the group of ranch buildings;\nholding on over the open reach of his ranch, his teeth set, his heels\ndigging furiously into the ground. The minutes passed. He walked on\nswiftly, muttering to himself from time to time.\n\n“Gone, by the Lord. Gone, by the Lord. By the Lord Harry, she's cleared\nout.”\n\nAs yet his head was empty of all thought. He could not steady his wits\nto consider this new turn of affairs. He did not even try.\n\n“Gone, by the Lord,” he exclaimed. “By the Lord, she's cleared out.”\n\nHe found the irrigating ditch, and the beaten path made by the ditch\ntenders that bordered it, and followed it some five minutes; then struck\noff at right angles over the rugged surface of the ranch land, to where\na great white stone jutted from the ground. There he sat down, and\nleaning forward, rested his elbows on his knees, and looked out vaguely\ninto the night, his thoughts swiftly readjusting themselves.\n\nHe was alone. The silence of the night, the infinite repose of the\nflat, bare earth--two immensities--widened around and above him like\nillimitable seas. A grey half-light, mysterious, grave, flooded downward\nfrom the stars.\n\nAnnixter was in torment. Now, there could be no longer any doubt--now it\nwas Hilma or nothing. Once out of his reach, once lost to him, and the\nrecollection of her assailed him with unconquerable vehemence. Much as\nshe had occupied his mind, he had never realised till now how vast had\nbeen the place she had filled in his life. He had told her as much, but\neven then he did not believe it.\n\nSuddenly, a bitter rage against himself overwhelmed him as he thought of\nthe hurt he had given her the previous evening. He should have managed\ndifferently. How, he did not know, but the sense of the outrage he had\nput upon her abruptly recoiled against him with cruel force. Now, he was\nsorry for it, infinitely sorry, passionately sorry. He had hurt her.\nHe had brought the tears to her eyes. He had so flagrantly insulted her\nthat she could no longer bear to breathe the same air with him. She had\ntold her parents all. She had left Quien Sabe--had left him for good,\nat the very moment when he believed he had won her. Brute, beast that he\nwas, he had driven her away.\n\nAn hour went by; then two, then four, then six. Annixter still sat in\nhis place, groping and battling in a confusion of spirit, the like of\nwhich he had never felt before. He did not know what was the matter with\nhim. He could not find his way out of the dark and out of the turmoil\nthat wheeled around him. He had had no experience with women. There was\nno precedent to guide him. How was he to get out of this? What was the\nclew that would set everything straight again?\n\nThat he would give Hilma up, never once entered his head. Have her he\nwould. She had given herself to him. Everything should have been easy\nafter that, and instead, here he was alone in the night, wrestling with\nhimself, in deeper trouble than ever, and Hilma farther than ever away\nfrom him.\n\nIt was true, he might have Hilma, even now, if he was willing to marry\nher. But marriage, to his mind, had been always a vague, most remote\npossibility, almost as vague and as remote as his death,--a thing that\nhappened to some men, but that would surely never occur to him, or, if\nit did, it would be after long years had passed, when he was older, more\nsettled, more mature--an event that belonged to the period of his middle\nlife, distant as yet.\n\nHe had never faced the question of his marriage. He had kept it at an\nimmense distance from him. It had never been a part of his order of\nthings. He was not a marrying man.\n\nBut Hilma was an ever-present reality, as near to him as his right hand.\nMarriage was a formless, far distant abstraction. Hilma a tangible,\nimminent fact. Before he could think of the two as one; before he could\nconsider the idea of marriage, side by side with the idea of Hilma,\nmeasureless distances had to be traversed, things as disassociated in\nhis mind as fire and water, had to be fused together; and between the\ntwo he was torn as if upon a rack.\n\nSlowly, by imperceptible degrees, the imagination, unused, unwilling\nmachine, began to work. The brain's activity lapsed proportionately.\nHe began to think less, and feel more. In that rugged composition,\nconfused, dark, harsh, a furrow had been driven deep, a little seed\nplanted, a little seed at first weak, forgotten, lost in the lower dark\nplaces of his character.\n\nBut as the intellect moved slower, its functions growing numb, the\nidea of self dwindled. Annixter no longer considered himself; no longer\nconsidered the notion of marriage from the point of view of his own\ncomfort, his own wishes, his own advantage. He realised that in his\nnewfound desire to make her happy, he was sincere. There was something\nin that idea, after all. To make some one happy--how about that now? It\nwas worth thinking of.\n\nFar away, low down in the east, a dim belt, a grey light began to whiten\nover the horizon. The tower of the Mission stood black against it. The\ndawn was coming. The baffling obscurity of the night was passing. Hidden\nthings were coming into view.\n\nAnnixter, his eyes half-closed, his chin upon his fist, allowed his\nimagination full play. How would it be if he should take Hilma into\nhis life, this beautiful young girl, pure as he now knew her to be;\ninnocent, noble with the inborn nobility of dawning womanhood? An\noverwhelming sense of his own unworthiness suddenly bore down upon him\nwith crushing force, as he thought of this. He had gone about the\nwhole affair wrongly. He had been mistaken from the very first. She was\ninfinitely above him. He did not want--he should not desire to be the\nmaster. It was she, his servant, poor, simple, lowly even, who should\ncondescend to him.\n\nAbruptly there was presented to his mind's eye a picture of the years to\ncome, if he now should follow his best, his highest, his most unselfish\nimpulse. He saw Hilma, his own, for better or for worse, for richer or\nfor poorer, all barriers down between them, he giving himself to her as\nfreely, as nobly, as she had given herself to him. By a supreme effort,\nnot of the will, but of the emotion, he fought his way across that\nvast gulf that for a time had gaped between Hilma and the idea of his\nmarriage. Instantly, like the swift blending of beautiful colours, like\nthe harmony of beautiful chords of music, the two ideas melted into one,\nand in that moment into his harsh, unlovely world a new idea was born.\nAnnixter stood suddenly upright, a mighty tenderness, a gentleness\nof spirit, such as he had never conceived of, in his heart strained,\nswelled, and in a moment seemed to burst. Out of the dark furrows of\nhis soul, up from the deep rugged recesses of his being, something rose,\nexpanding. He opened his arms wide. An immense happiness overpowered\nhim. Actual tears came to his eyes. Without knowing why, he was not\nashamed of it. This poor, crude fellow, harsh, hard, narrow, with his\nunlovely nature, his fierce truculency, his selfishness, his obstinacy,\nabruptly knew that all the sweetness of life, all the great vivifying\neternal force of humanity had burst into life within him.\n\nThe little seed, long since planted, gathering strength quietly, had at\nlast germinated.\n\nThen as the realisation of this hardened into certainty, in the growing\nlight of the new day that had just dawned for him, Annixter uttered a\ncry. Now at length, he knew the meaning of it all.\n\n“Why--I--I, I LOVE her,” he cried. Never until then had it occurred to\nhim. Never until then, in all his thoughts of Hilma, had that great word\npassed his lips.\n\nIt was a Memnonian cry, the greeting of the hard, harsh image of man,\nrough-hewn, flinty, granitic, uttering a note of joy, acclaiming the new\nrisen sun.\n\nBy now it was almost day. The east glowed opalescent. All about him\nAnnixter saw the land inundated with light. But there was a change.\nOvernight something had occurred. In his perturbation the change seemed\nto him, at first, elusive, almost fanciful, unreal. But now as the light\nspread, he looked again at the gigantic scroll of ranch lands unrolled\nbefore him from edge to edge of the horizon. The change was not\nfanciful. The change was real. The earth was no longer bare. The land\nwas no longer barren,--no longer empty, no longer dull brown. All at\nonce Annixter shouted aloud.\n\nThere it was, the Wheat, the Wheat! The little seed long planted,\ngerminating in the deep, dark furrows of the soil, straining, swelling,\nsuddenly in one night had burst upward to the light. The wheat had\ncome up. It was there before him, around him, everywhere, illimitable,\nimmeasurable. The winter brownness of the ground was overlaid with a\nlittle shimmer of green. The promise of the sowing was being fulfilled.\nThe earth, the loyal mother, who never failed, who never disappointed,\nwas keeping her faith again. Once more the strength of nations was\nrenewed. Once more the force of the world was revivified. Once more\nthe Titan, benignant, calm, stirred and woke, and the morning abruptly\nblazed into glory upon the spectacle of a man whose heart leaped\nexuberant with the love of a woman, and an exulting earth gleaming\ntranscendent with the radiant magnificence of an inviolable pledge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nPresley's room in the ranch house of Los Muertos was in the second story\nof the building. It was a corner room; one of its windows facing the\nsouth, the other the east. Its appointments were of the simplest. In\none angle was the small white painted iron bed, covered with a white\ncounterpane. The walls were hung with a white paper figured with knots\nof pale green leaves, very gay and bright. There was a straw matting\non the floor. White muslin half-curtains hung in the windows, upon\nthe sills of which certain plants bearing pink waxen flowers of which\nPresley did not know the name, grew in oblong green boxes. The walls\nwere unadorned, save by two pictures, one a reproduction of the “Reading\nfrom Homer,” the other a charcoal drawing of the Mission of San Juan de\nGuadalajara, which Presley had made himself. By the east window stood\nthe plainest of deal tables, innocent of any cloth or covering, such as\nmight have been used in a kitchen. It was Presley's work table, and was\ninvariably littered with papers, half-finished manuscripts, drafts of\npoems, notebooks, pens, half-smoked cigarettes, and the like. Near at\nhand, upon a shelf, were his books. There were but two chairs in the\nroom--the straight backed wooden chair, that stood in front of the\ntable, angular, upright, and in which it was impossible to take one's\nease, and the long comfortable wicker steamer chair, stretching its\nlength in front of the south window. Presley was immensely fond of\nthis room. It amused and interested him to maintain its air of rigorous\nsimplicity and freshness. He abhorred cluttered bric-a-brac and\nmeaningless objets d'art. Once in so often he submitted his room to a\nvigorous inspection; setting it to rights, removing everything but the\nessentials, the few ornaments which, in a way, were part of his life.\n\nHis writing had by this time undergone a complete change. The notes for\nhis great Song of the West, the epic poem he once had hoped to write\nhe had flung aside, together with all the abortive attempts at its\nbeginning. Also he had torn up a great quantity of “fugitive” verses,\npreserving only a certain half-finished poem, that he called “The\nToilers.” This poem was a comment upon the social fabric, and had been\ninspired by the sight of a painting he had seen in Cedarquist's art\ngallery. He had written all but the last verse.\n\nOn the day that he had overheard the conversation between Dyke and\nCaraher, in the latter's saloon, which had acquainted him with the\nmonstrous injustice of the increased tariff, Presley had returned to Los\nMuertos, white and trembling, roused to a pitch of exaltation, the like\nof which he had never known in all his life. His wrath was little short\nof even Caraher's. He too “saw red”; a mighty spirit of revolt heaved\ntumultuous within him. It did not seem possible that this outrage could\ngo on much longer. The oppression was incredible; the plain story of\nit set down in truthful statement of fact would not be believed by the\noutside world.\n\nHe went up to his little room and paced the floor with clenched fists\nand burning face, till at last, the repression of his contending\nthoughts all but suffocated him, and he flung himself before his table\nand began to write. For a time, his pen seemed to travel of itself;\nwords came to him without searching, shaping themselves into\nphrases,--the phrases building themselves up to great, forcible\nsentences, full of eloquence, of fire, of passion. As his prose grew\nmore exalted, it passed easily into the domain of poetry. Soon the\ncadence of his paragraphs settled to an ordered beat and rhythm, and in\nthe end Presley had thrust aside his journal and was once more writing\nverse.\n\nHe picked up his incomplete poem of “The Toilers,” read it hastily a\ncouple of times to catch its swing, then the Idea of the last verse--the\nIdea for which he so long had sought in vain--abruptly springing to his\nbrain, wrote it off without so much as replenishing his pen with ink.\nHe added still another verse, bringing the poem to a definite close,\nresuming its entire conception, and ending with a single majestic\nthought, simple, noble, dignified, absolutely convincing.\n\nPresley laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair, with the\ncertainty that for one moment he had touched untrod heights. His hands\nwere cold, his head on fire, his heart leaping tumultuous in his breast.\n\nNow at last, he had achieved. He saw why he had never grasped the\ninspiration for his vast, vague, IMPERSONAL Song of the West. At the\ntime when he sought for it, his convictions had not been aroused; he\nhad not then cared for the People. His sympathies had not been touched.\nSmall wonder that he had missed it. Now he was of the People; he had\nbeen stirred to his lowest depths. His earnestness was almost a frenzy.\nHe BELIEVED, and so to him all things were possible at once.\n\nThen the artist in him reasserted itself. He became more interested in\nhis poem, as such, than in the cause that had inspired it. He went over\nit again, retouching it carefully, changing a word here and there, and\nimproving its rhythm. For the moment, he forgot the People, forgot his\nrage, his agitation of the previous hour, he remembered only that he had\nwritten a great poem.\n\nThen doubt intruded. After all, was it so great? Did not its sublimity\noverpass a little the bounds of the ridiculous? Had he seen true? Had he\nfailed again? He re-read the poem carefully; and it seemed all at once\nto lose force.\n\nBy now, Presley could not tell whether what he had written was true\npoetry or doggerel. He distrusted profoundly his own judgment. He must\nhave the opinion of some one else, some one competent to judge. He could\nnot wait; to-morrow would not do. He must know to a certainty before he\ncould rest that night.\n\nHe made a careful copy of what he had written, and putting on his hat\nand laced boots, went down stairs and out upon the lawn, crossing over\nto the stables. He found Phelps there, washing down the buckboard.\n\n“Do you know where Vanamee is to-day?” he asked the latter. Phelps put\nhis chin in the air.\n\n“Ask me something easy,” he responded. “He might be at Guadalajara, or\nhe might be up at Osterman's, or he might be a hundred miles away from\neither place. I know where he ought to be, Mr. Presley, but that ain't\nsaying where the crazy gesabe is. He OUGHT to be range-riding over east\nof Four, at the head waters of Mission Creek.”\n\n“I'll try for him there, at all events,” answered Presley. “If you see\nHarran when he comes in, tell him I may not be back in time for supper.”\n\nPresley found the pony in the corral, cinched the saddle upon him, and\nwent off over the Lower Road, going eastward at a brisk canter.\n\nAt Hooven's he called a “How do you do” to Minna, whom he saw lying in a\nslat hammock under the mammoth live oak, her foot in bandages; and\nthen galloped on over the bridge across the irrigating ditch, wondering\nvaguely what would become of such a pretty girl as Minna, and if in\nthe end she would marry the Portuguese foreman in charge of the\nditching-gang. He told himself that he hoped she would, and that\nspeedily. There was no lack of comment as to Minna Hooven about the\nranches. Certainly she was a good girl, but she was seen at all hours\nhere and there about Bonneville and Guadalajara, skylarking with the\nPortuguese farm hands of Quien Sabe and Los Muertos. She was very\npretty; the men made fools of themselves over her. Presley hoped they\nwould not end by making a fool of her.\n\nJust beyond the irrigating ditch, Presley left the Lower Road, and\nfollowing a trail that branched off southeasterly from this point, held\non across the Fourth Division of the ranch, keeping the Mission Creek\non his left. A few miles farther on, he went through a gate in a barbed\nwire fence, and at once engaged himself in a system of little arroyos\nand low rolling hills, that steadily lifted and increased in size as\nhe proceeded. This higher ground was the advance guard of the Sierra\nfoothills, and served as the stock range for Los Muertos. The hills were\nhuge rolling hummocks of bare ground, covered only by wild oats. At\nlong intervals, were isolated live oaks. In the canyons and arroyos, the\nchaparral and manzanita grew in dark olive-green thickets. The ground\nwas honey-combed with gopher-holes, and the gophers themselves were\neverywhere. Occasionally a jack rabbit bounded across the open, from one\ngrowth of chaparral to another, taking long leaps, his ears erect. High\noverhead, a hawk or two swung at anchor, and once, with a startling rush\nof wings, a covey of quail flushed from the brush at the side of the\ntrail.\n\nOn the hillsides, in thinly scattered groups were the cattle, grazing\ndeliberately, working slowly toward the water-holes for their evening\ndrink, the horses keeping to themselves, the colts nuzzling at their\nmothers' bellies, whisking their tails, stamping their unshod feet. But\nonce in a remoter field, solitary, magnificent, enormous, the short hair\ncurling tight upon his forehead, his small red eyes twinkling, his vast\nneck heavy with muscles, Presley came upon the monarch, the king,\nthe great Durham bull, maintaining his lonely state, unapproachable,\naustere.\n\nPresley found the one-time shepherd by a water-hole, in a far distant\ncorner of the range. He had made his simple camp for the night. His\nblue-grey army blanket lay spread under a live oak, his horse grazed\nnear at hand. He himself sat on his heels before a little fire of\ndead manzanita roots, cooking his coffee and bacon. Never had Presley\nconceived so keen an impression of loneliness as his crouching figure\npresented. The bald, bare landscape widened about him to infinity.\nVanamee was a spot in it all, a tiny dot, a single atom of human\norganisation, floating endlessly on the ocean of an illimitable nature.\n\nThe two friends ate together, and Vanamee, having snared a brace of\nquails, dressed and then roasted them on a sharpened stick. After\neating, they drank great refreshing draughts from the water-hole. Then,\nat length, Presley having lit his cigarette, and Vanamee his pipe, the\nformer said:\n\n“Vanamee, I have been writing again.”\n\nVanamee turned his lean ascetic face toward him, his black eyes fixed\nattentively.\n\n“I know,” he said, “your journal.”\n\n“No, this is a poem. You remember, I told you about it once. 'The\nToilers,' I called it.”\n\n“Oh, verse! Well, I am glad you have gone back to it. It is your natural\nvehicle.”\n\n“You remember the poem?” asked Presley. “It was unfinished.”\n\n“Yes, I remember it. There was better promise in it than anything you\never wrote. Now, I suppose, you have finished it.”\n\nWithout reply, Presley brought it from out the breast pocket of his\nshooting coat. The moment seemed propitious. The stillness of the vast,\nbare hills was profound. The sun was setting in a cloudless brazier of\nred light; a golden dust pervaded all the landscape. Presley read his\npoem aloud. When he had finished, his friend looked at him.\n\n“What have you been doing lately?” he demanded. Presley, wondering, told\nof his various comings and goings.\n\n“I don't mean that,” returned the other. “Something has happened to you,\nsomething has aroused you. I am right, am I not? Yes, I thought so. In\nthis poem of yours, you have not been trying to make a sounding piece of\nliterature. You wrote it under tremendous stress. Its very imperfections\nshow that. It is better than a mere rhyme. It is an Utterance--a\nMessage. It is Truth. You have come back to the primal heart of things,\nand you have seen clearly. Yes, it is a great poem.”\n\n“Thank you,” exclaimed Presley fervidly. “I had begun to mistrust\nmyself.”\n\n“Now,” observed Vanamee, “I presume you will rush it into print. To have\nformulated a great thought, simply to have accomplished, is not enough.”\n\n“I think I am sincere,” objected Presley. “If it is good it will do good\nto others. You said yourself it was a Message. If it has any value, I do\nnot think it would be right to keep it back from even a very small and\nmost indifferent public.”\n\n“Don't publish it in the magazines at all events,” Vanamee answered.\n“Your inspiration has come FROM the People. Then let it go straight TO\nthe People--not the literary readers of the monthly periodicals, the\nrich, who would only be indirectly interested. If you must publish it,\nlet it be in the daily press. Don't interrupt. I know what you will say.\nIt will be that the daily press is common, is vulgar, is undignified;\nand I tell you that such a poem as this of yours, called as it is, 'The\nToilers,' must be read BY the Toilers. It MUST BE common; it must be\nvulgarised. You must not stand upon your dignity with the People, if you\nare to reach them.”\n\n“That is true, I suppose,” Presley admitted, “but I can't get rid of the\nidea that it would be throwing my poem away. The great magazine gives me\nsuch--a--background; gives me such weight.”\n\n“Gives YOU such weight, gives you such background. Is it YOURSELF you\nthink of? You helper of the helpless. Is that your sincerity? You must\nsink yourself; must forget yourself and your own desire of fame, of\nadmitted success. It is your POEM, your MESSAGE, that must\nprevail,--not YOU, who wrote it. You preach a doctrine of abnegation, of\nself-obliteration, and you sign your name to your words as high on the\ntablets as you can reach, so that all the world may see, not the poem,\nbut the poet. Presley, there are many like you. The social reformer\nwrites a book on the iniquity of the possession of land, and out of the\nproceeds, buys a corner lot. The economist who laments the hardships of\nthe poor, allows himself to grow rich upon the sale of his book.”\n\nBut Presley would hear no further.\n\n“No,” he cried, “I know I am sincere, and to prove it to you, I will\npublish my poem, as you say, in the daily press, and I will accept no\nmoney for it.”\n\nThey talked on for about an hour, while the evening wore away. Presley\nvery soon noticed that Vanamee was again preoccupied. More than ever\nof late, his silence, his brooding had increased. By and by he rose\nabruptly, turning his head to the north, in the direction of the Mission\nchurch of San Juan. “I think,” he said to Presley, “that I must be\ngoing.”\n\n“Going? Where to at this time of night?”\n\n“Off there.” Vanamee made an uncertain gesture toward the north.\n“Good-bye,” and without another word he disappeared in the grey of the\ntwilight. Presley was left alone wondering. He found his horse, and,\ntightening the girths, mounted and rode home under the sheen of the\nstars, thoughtful, his head bowed. Before he went to bed that night\nhe sent “The Toilers” to the Sunday Editor of a daily newspaper in San\nFrancisco.\n\nUpon leaving Presley, Vanamee, his thumbs hooked into his empty\ncartridge belt, strode swiftly down from the hills of the Los Muertos\nstock-range and on through the silent town of Guadalajara. His lean,\nswarthy face, with its hollow cheeks, fine, black, pointed beard,\nand sad eyes, was set to the northward. As was his custom, he was\nbareheaded, and the rapidity of his stride made a breeze in his long,\nblack hair. He knew where he was going. He knew what he must live\nthrough that night.\n\nAgain, the deathless grief that never slept leaped out of the shadows,\nand fastened upon his shoulders. It was scourging him back to that scene\nof a vanished happiness, a dead romance, a perished idyl,--the Mission\ngarden in the shade of the venerable pear trees.\n\nBut, besides this, other influences tugged at his heart. There was a\nmystery in the garden. In that spot the night was not always empty, the\ndarkness not always silent. Something far off stirred and listened to\nhis cry, at times drawing nearer to him. At first this presence had\nbeen a matter for terror; but of late, as he felt it gradually drawing\nnearer, the terror had at long intervals given place to a feeling of an\nalmost ineffable sweetness. But distrusting his own senses, unwilling\nto submit himself to such torturing, uncertain happiness, averse to the\nterrible confusion of spirit that followed upon a night spent in the\ngarden, Vanamee had tried to keep away from the place. However, when the\nsorrow of his life reassailed him, and the thoughts and recollections of\nAngele brought the ache into his heart, and the tears to his eyes, the\ntemptation to return to the garden invariably gripped him close. There\nwere times when he could not resist. Of themselves, his footsteps turned\nin that direction. It was almost as if he himself had been called.\n\nGuadalajara was silent, dark. Not even in Solotari's was there a light.\nThe town was asleep. Only the inevitable guitar hummed from an unseen\n'dobe. Vanamee pushed on. The smell of the fields and open country, and\na distant scent of flowers that he knew well, came to his nostrils,\nas he emerged from the town by way of the road that led on towards the\nMission through Quien Sabe. On either side of him lay the brown earth,\nsilently nurturing the implanted seed. Two days before it had rained\ncopiously, and the soil, still moist, disengaged a pungent aroma of\nfecundity.\n\nVanamee, following the road, passed through the collection of buildings\nof Annixter's home ranch. Everything slept. At intervals, the aer-motor\non the artesian well creaked audibly, as it turned in a languid breeze\nfrom the northeast. A cat, hunting field-mice, crept from the shadow\nof the gigantic barn and paused uncertainly in the open, the tip of\nher tail twitching. From within the barn itself came the sound of the\nfriction of a heavy body and a stir of hoofs, as one of the dozing cows\nlay down with a long breath.\n\nVanamee left the ranch house behind him and proceeded on his way. Beyond\nhim, to the right of the road, he could make out the higher ground in\nthe Mission enclosure, and the watching tower of the Mission itself. The\nminutes passed. He went steadily forward. Then abruptly he paused, his\nhead in the air, eye and ear alert. To that strange sixth sense of his,\nresponsive as the leaves of the sensitive plant, had suddenly come the\nimpression of a human being near at hand. He had neither seen nor\nheard, but for all that he stopped an instant in his tracks; then, the\nsensation confirmed, went on again with slow steps, advancing warily.\n\nAt last, his swiftly roving eyes lighted upon an object, just darker\nthan the grey-brown of the night-ridden land. It was at some distance\nfrom the roadside. Vanamee approached it cautiously, leaving the road,\ntreading carefully upon the moist clods of earth underfoot. Twenty paces\ndistant, he halted.\n\nAnnixter was there, seated upon a round, white rock, his back towards\nhim. He was leaning forward, his elbows on his knees, his chin in his\nhands. He did not move. Silent, motionless, he gazed out upon the flat,\nsombre land.\n\nIt was the night wherein the master of Quien Sabe wrought out his\nsalvation, struggling with Self from dusk to dawn. At the moment when\nVanamee came upon him, the turmoil within him had only begun. The\nheart of the man had not yet wakened. The night was young, the dawn far\ndistant, and all around him the fields of upturned clods lay bare and\nbrown, empty of all life, unbroken by a single green shoot.\n\nFor a moment, the life-circles of these two men, of so widely differing\ncharacters, touched each other, there in the silence of the night under\nthe stars. Then silently Vanamee withdrew, going on his way, wondering\nat the trouble that, like himself, drove this hardheaded man of affairs,\nuntroubled by dreams, out into the night to brood over an empty land.\n\nThen speedily he forgot all else. The material world drew off from him.\nReality dwindled to a point and vanished like the vanishing of a star\nat moonrise. Earthly things dissolved and disappeared, as a strange,\nunnamed essence flowed in upon him. A new atmosphere for him pervaded\nhis surroundings. He entered the world of the Vision, of the Legend, of\nthe Miracle, where all things were possible. He stood at the gate of the\nMission garden.\n\nAbove him rose the ancient tower of the Mission church. Through the\narches at its summit, where swung the Spanish queen's bells, he saw the\nslow-burning stars. The silent bats, with flickering wings, threw their\ndancing shadows on the pallid surface of the venerable facade.\n\nNot the faintest chirring of a cricket broke the silence. The bees were\nasleep. In the grasses, in the trees, deep in the calix of punka flower\nand magnolia bloom, the gnats, the caterpillars, the beetles, all the\nmicroscopic, multitudinous life of the daytime drowsed and dozed. Not\neven the minute scuffling of a lizard over the warm, worn pavement of\nthe colonnade disturbed the infinite repose, the profound stillness.\nOnly within the garden, the intermittent trickling of the fountain made\nitself heard, flowing steadily, marking off the lapse of seconds,\nthe progress of hours, the cycle of years, the inevitable march of\ncenturies. At one time, the doorway before which Vanamee now stood had\nbeen hermetically closed. But he, himself, had long since changed that.\nHe stood before it for a moment, steeping himself in the mystery and\nromance of the place, then raising he latch, pushed open the gate,\nentered, and closed it softly behind him. He was in the cloister garden.\n\nThe stars were out, strewn thick and close in the deep blue of the sky,\nthe milky way glowing like a silver veil. Ursa Major wheeled gigantic\nin the north. The great nebula in Orion was a whorl of shimmering star\ndust. Venus flamed a lambent disk of pale saffron, low over the horizon.\nFrom edge to edge of the world marched the constellations, like the\nprogress of emperors, and from the innumerable glory of their courses a\nmysterious sheen of diaphanous light disengaged itself, expanding over\nall the earth, serene, infinite, majestic.\n\nThe little garden revealed itself but dimly beneath the brooding light,\nonly half emerging from the shadow. The polished surfaces of the leaves\nof the pear trees winked faintly back the reflected light as the trees\njust stirred in the uncertain breeze. A blurred shield of silver marked\nthe ripples of the fountain. Under the flood of dull blue lustre, the\ngravelled walks lay vague amid the grasses, like webs of white satin\non the bed of a lake. Against the eastern wall the headstones of the\ngraves, an indistinct procession of grey cowls ranged themselves.\n\nVanamee crossed the garden, pausing to kiss the turf upon Angele's\ngrave. Then he approached the line of pear trees, and laid himself down\nin their shadow, his chin propped upon his hands, his eyes wandering\nover the expanse of the little valley that stretched away from the foot\nof the hill upon which the Mission was built.\n\nOnce again he summoned the Vision. Once again he conjured up the\nIllusion. Once again, tortured with doubt, racked with a deathless\ngrief, he craved an Answer of the night. Once again, mystic that he\nwas, he sent his mind out from him across the enchanted sea of the\nSupernatural. Hope, of what he did not know, roused up within him.\nSurely, on such a night as this, the hallucination must define itself.\nSurely, the Manifestation must be vouchsafed.\n\nHis eyes closed, his will girding itself to a supreme effort, his senses\nexalted to a state of pleasing numbness, he called upon Angele to come\nto him, his voiceless cry penetrating far out into that sea of faint,\nephemeral light that floated tideless over the little valley beneath\nhim. Then motionless, prone upon the ground, he waited.\n\nMonths had passed since that first night when, at length, an Answer had\ncome to Vanamee. At first, startled out of all composure, troubled and\nstirred to his lowest depths, because of the very thing for which he\nsought, he resolved never again to put his strange powers to the test.\nBut for all that, he had come a second night to the garden, and a third,\nand a fourth. At last, his visits were habitual. Night after night\nhe was there, surrendering himself to the influences of the place,\ngradually convinced that something did actually answer when he called.\nHis faith increased as the winter grew into spring. As the spring\nadvanced and the nights became shorter, it crystallised into certainty.\nWould he have her again, his love, long dead? Would she come to him once\nmore out of the grave, out of the night? He could not tell; he could\nonly hope. All that he knew was that his cry found an answer, that his\noutstretched hands, groping in the darkness, met the touch of other\nfingers. Patiently he waited. The nights became warmer as the spring\ndrew on. The stars shone clearer. The nights seemed brighter. For nearly\na month after the occasion of his first answer nothing new occurred.\nSome nights it failed him entirely; upon others it was faint, illusive.\n\nThen, at last, the most subtle, the barest of perceptible changes began.\nHis groping mind far-off there, wandering like a lost bird over the\nvalley, touched upon some thing again, touched and held it and this\ntime drew it a single step closer to him. His heart beating, the blood\nsurging in his temples, he watched with the eyes of his imagination,\nthis gradual approach. What was coming to him? Who was coming to him?\nShrouded in the obscurity of the night, whose was the face now turned\ntowards his? Whose the footsteps that with such infinite slowness drew\nnearer to where he waited? He did not dare to say.\n\nHis mind went back many years to that time before the tragedy of\nAngele's death, before the mystery of the Other. He waited then as he\nwaited now. But then he had not waited in vain. Then, as now, he had\nseemed to feel her approach, seemed to feel her drawing nearer and\nnearer to their rendezvous. Now, what would happen? He did not know. He\nwaited. He waited, hoping all things. He waited, believing all things.\nHe waited, enduring all things. He trusted in the Vision.\n\nMeanwhile, as spring advanced, the flowers in the Seed ranch began\nto come to life. Over the five hundred acres whereon the flowers were\nplanted, the widening growth of vines and bushes spread like the waves\nof a green sea. Then, timidly, colours of the faintest tints began to\nappear. Under the moonlight, Vanamee saw them expanding, delicate\npink, faint blue, tenderest variations of lavender and yellow, white\nshimmering with reflections of gold, all subdued and pallid in the\nmoonlight.\n\nBy degrees, the night became impregnated with the perfume of the\nflowers. Illusive at first, evanescent as filaments of gossamer; then\nas the buds opened, emphasising itself, breathing deeper, stronger. An\nexquisite mingling of many odours passed continually over the Mission,\nfrom the garden of the Seed ranch, meeting and blending with the aroma\nof its magnolia buds and punka blossoms.\n\nAs the colours of the flowers of the Seed ranch deepened, and as their\nodours penetrated deeper and more distinctly, as the starlight of each\nsucceeding night grew brighter and the air became warmer, the illusion\ndefined itself. By imperceptible degrees, as Vanamee waited under the\nshadows of the pear trees, the Answer grew nearer and nearer. He saw\nnothing but the distant glimmer of the flowers. He heard nothing but\nthe drip of the fountain. Nothing moved about him but the invisible,\nslow-passing breaths of perfume; yet he felt the approach of the Vision.\n\nIt came first to about the middle of the Seed ranch itself, some half\na mile away, where the violets grew; shrinking, timid flowers, hiding\nclose to the ground. Then it passed forward beyond the violets, and drew\nnearer and stood amid the mignonette, hardier blooms that dared\nlook heavenward from out the leaves. A few nights later it left the\nmignonette behind, and advanced into the beds of white iris that pushed\nmore boldly forth from the earth, their waxen petals claiming the\nattention. It advanced then a long step into the proud, challenging\nbeauty of the carnations and roses; and at last, after many nights,\nVanamee felt that it paused, as if trembling at its hardihood, full\nin the superb glory of the royal lilies themselves, that grew on the\nextreme border of the Seed ranch nearest to him. After this, there was\na certain long wait. Then, upon a dark midnight, it advanced again.\nVanamee could scarcely repress a cry. Now, the illusion emerged from the\nflowers. It stood, not distant, but unseen, almost at the base of the\nhill upon whose crest he waited, in a depression of the ground where the\nshadows lay thickest. It was nearly within earshot.\n\nThe nights passed. The spring grew warmer. In the daytime intermittent\nrains freshened all the earth. The flowers of the Seed ranch grew\nrapidly. Bud after bud burst forth, while those already opened expanded\nto full maturity. The colour of the Seed ranch deepened.\n\nOne night, after hours of waiting, Vanamee felt upon his cheek the touch\nof a prolonged puff of warm wind, breathing across the little valley\nfrom out the east. It reached the Mission garden and stirred the\nbranches of the pear trees. It seemed veritably to be compounded of\nthe very essence of the flowers. Never had the aroma been so sweet, so\npervasive. It passed and faded, leaving in its wake an absolute silence.\nThen, at length, the silence of the night, that silence to which Vanamee\nhad so long appealed, was broken by a tiny sound. Alert, half-risen from\nthe ground, he listened; for now, at length, he heard something. The\nsound repeated itself. It came from near at hand, from the thick shadow\nat the foot of the hill. What it was, he could not tell, but it did not\nbelong to a single one of the infinite similar noises of the place with\nwhich he was so familiar. It was neither the rustle of a leaf, the snap\nof a parted twig, the drone of an insect, the dropping of a magnolia\nblossom. It was a vibration merely, faint, elusive, impossible of\ndefinition; a minute notch in the fine, keen edge of stillness.\n\nAgain the nights passed. The summer stars became brighter. The warmth\nincreased. The flowers of the Seed ranch grew still more. The five\nhundred acres of the ranch were carpeted with them.\n\nAt length, upon a certain midnight, a new light began to spread in\nthe sky. The thin scimitar of the moon rose, veiled and dim behind the\nearth-mists. The light increased. Distant objects, until now hidden,\ncame into view, and as the radiance brightened, Vanamee, looking down\nupon the little valley, saw a spectacle of incomparable beauty. All the\nbuds of the Seed ranch had opened. The faint tints of the flowers had\ndeepened, had asserted themselves. They challenged the eye. Pink became\na royal red. Blue rose into purple. Yellow flamed into orange. Orange\nglowed golden and brilliant. The earth disappeared under great bands and\nfields of resplendent colour. Then, at length, the moon abruptly soared\nzenithward from out the veiling mist, passing from one filmy haze to\nanother. For a moment there was a gleam of a golden light, and Vanamee,\nhis eyes searching the shade at the foot of the hill, felt his heart\nsuddenly leap, and then hang poised, refusing to beat. In that instant\nof passing light, something had caught his eye. Something that moved,\ndown there, half in and half out of the shadow, at the hill's foot.\nIt had come and gone in an instant. The haze once more screened the\nmoonlight. The shade again engulfed the vision. What was it he had seen?\nHe did not know. So brief had been that movement, the drowsy brain had\nnot been quick enough to interpret the cipher message of the eye. Now\nit was gone. But something had been there. He had seen it. Was it the\nlifting of a strand of hair, the wave of a white hand, the flutter of a\ngarment's edge? He could not tell, but it did not belong to any of those\nsights which he had seen so often in that place. It was neither the\nglancing of a moth's wing, the nodding of a wind-touched blossom, nor\nthe noiseless flitting of a bat. It was a gleam merely, faint, elusive,\nimpossible of definition, an intangible agitation, in the vast, dim blur\nof the darkness.\n\nAnd that was all. Until now no single real thing had occurred, nothing\nthat Vanamee could reduce to terms of actuality, nothing he could put\ninto words. The manifestation, when not recognisable to that strange\nsixth sense of his, appealed only to the most refined, the most delicate\nperception of eye and ear. It was all ephemeral, filmy, dreamy, the\nmystic forming of the Vision--the invisible developing a concrete\nnucleus, the starlight coagulating, the radiance of the flowers\nthickening to something actual; perfume, the most delicious fragrance,\nbecoming a tangible presence.\n\nBut into that garden the serpent intruded. Though cradled in the slow\nrhythm of the dream, lulled by this beauty of a summer's night, heavy\nwith the scent of flowers, the silence broken only by a rippling\nfountain, the darkness illuminated by a world of radiant blossoms,\nVanamee could not forget the tragedy of the Other; that terror of many\nyears ago,--that prowler of the night, that strange, fearful figure with\nthe unseen face, swooping in there from out the darkness, gone in\nan instant, yet leaving behind the trail and trace of death and of\npollution.\n\nNever had Vanamee seen this more clearly than when leaving Presley on\nthe stock range of Los Muertos, he had come across to the Mission garden\nby way of the Quien Sabe ranch.\n\nIt was the same night in which Annixter out-watched the stars, coming,\nat last, to himself.\n\nAs the hours passed, the two men, far apart, ignoring each other, waited\nfor the Manifestation,--Annixter on the ranch, Vanamee in the garden.\n\nProne upon his face, under the pear trees, his forehead buried in the\nhollow of his arm, Vanamee lay motionless. For the last time, raising\nhis head, he sent his voiceless cry out into the night across the\nmulti-coloured levels of the little valley, calling upon the miracle,\nsummoning the darkness to give Angele back to him, resigning himself to\nthe hallucination. He bowed his head upon his arm again and waited. The\nminutes passed. The fountain dripped steadily. Over the hills a haze of\nsaffron light foretold the rising of the full moon. Nothing stirred. The\nsilence was profound.\n\nThen, abruptly, Vanamee's right hand shut tight upon his wrist.\nThere--there it was. It began again, his invocation was answered. Far\noff there, the ripple formed again upon the still, black pool of\nthe night. No sound, no sight; vibration merely, appreciable by some\nsublimated faculty of the mind as yet unnamed. Rigid, his nerves taut,\nmotionless, prone on the ground, he waited.\n\nIt advanced with infinite slowness. Now it passed through the beds of\nviolets, now through the mignonette. A moment later, and he knew it\nstood among the white iris. Then it left those behind. It was in the\nsplendour of the red roses and carnations. It passed like a moving star\ninto the superb abundance, the imperial opulence of the royal lilies.\nIt was advancing slowly, but there was no pause. He held his breath, not\ndaring to raise his head. It passed beyond the limits of the Seed ranch,\nand entered the shade at the foot of the hill below him. Would it come\nfarther than this? Here it had always stopped hitherto, stopped for a\nmoment, and then, in spite of his efforts, had slipped from his grasp\nand faded back into the night. But now he wondered if he had been\nwilling to put forth his utmost strength, after all. Had there not\nalways been an element of dread in the thought of beholding the mystery\nface to face? Had he not even allowed the Vision to dissolve, the Answer\nto recede into the obscurity whence it came?\n\nBut never a night had been so beautiful as this. It was the full period\nof the spring. The air was a veritable caress. The infinite repose\nof the little garden, sleeping under the night, was delicious beyond\nexpression. It was a tiny corner of the world, shut off, discreet,\ndistilling romance, a garden of dreams, of enchantments.\n\nBelow, in the little valley, the resplendent colourations of the million\nflowers, roses, lilies, hyacinths, carnations, violets, glowed like\nincandescence in the golden light of the rising moon. The air was thick\nwith the perfume, heavy with it, clogged with it. The sweetness\nfilled the very mouth. The throat choked with it. Overhead wheeled the\nillimitable procession of the constellations. Underfoot, the earth was\nasleep. The very flowers were dreaming. A cathedral hush overlay all\nthe land, and a sense of benediction brooded low,--a divine kindliness\nmanifesting itself in beauty, in peace, in absolute repose.\n\nIt was a time for visions. It was the hour when dreams come true, and\nlying deep in the grasses beneath the pear trees, Vanamee, dizzied with\nmysticism, reaching up and out toward the supernatural, felt, as it\nwere, his mind begin to rise upward from out his body. He passed into a\nstate of being the like of which he had not known before. He felt that\nhis imagination was reshaping itself, preparing to receive an impression\nnever experienced until now. His body felt light to him, then it\ndwindled, vanished. He saw with new eyes, heard with new ears, felt with\na new heart.\n\n“Come to me,” he murmured.\n\nThen slowly he felt the advance of the Vision. It was approaching. Every\ninstant it drew gradually nearer. At last, he was to see. It had left\nthe shadow at the base of the hill; it was on the hill itself. Slowly,\nsteadily, it ascended the slope; just below him there, he heard a faint\nstirring. The grasses rustled under the touch of a foot. The leaves\nof the bushes murmured, as a hand brushed against them; a slender twig\ncreaked. The sounds of approach were more distinct. They came nearer.\nThey reached the top of the hill. They were within whispering distance.\n\nVanamee, trembling, kept his head buried in his arm. The sounds, at\nlength, paused definitely. The Vision could come no nearer. He raised\nhis head and looked. The moon had risen. Its great shield of gold\nstood over the eastern horizon. Within six feet of Vanamee, clear and\ndistinct, against the disk of the moon, stood the figure of a young\ngirl. She was dressed in a gown of scarlet silk, with flowing sleeves,\nsuch as Japanese wear, embroidered with flowers and figures of\nbirds worked in gold threads. On either side of her face, making\nthree-cornered her round, white forehead, hung the soft masses of her\nhair of gold. Her hands hung limply at her sides. But from between her\nparted lips--lips of almost an Egyptian fulness--her breath came slow\nand regular, and her eyes, heavy lidded, slanting upwards toward the\ntemples, perplexing, oriental, were closed. She was asleep.\n\nFrom out this life of flowers, this world of colour, this atmosphere\noppressive with perfume, this darkness clogged and cloyed, and thickened\nwith sweet odours, she came to him. She came to him from out of the\nflowers, the smell of the roses in her hair of gold, the aroma and the\nimperial red of the carnations in her lips, the whiteness of the lilies,\nthe perfume of the lilies, and the lilies' slender, balancing grace in\nher neck. Her hands disengaged the scent of the heliotrope. The folds of\nher scarlet gown gave off the enervating smell of poppies. Her feet were\nredolent of hyacinth. She stood before him, a Vision realised--a dream\ncome true. She emerged from out the invisible. He beheld her, a figure\nof gold and pale vermilion, redolent of perfume, poised motionless in\nthe faint saffron sheen of the new-risen moon. She, a creation of sleep,\nwas herself asleep. She, a dream, was herself dreaming.\n\nCalled forth from out the darkness, from the grip of the earth, the\nembrace of the grave, from out the memory of corruption, she rose into\nlight and life, divinely pure. Across that white forehead was no smudge,\nno trace of an earthly pollution--no mark of a terrestrial dishonour.\nHe saw in her the same beauty of untainted innocence he had known in his\nyouth. Years had made no difference with her. She was still young.\nIt was the old purity that returned, the deathless beauty, the\never-renascent life, the eternal consecrated and immortal youth. For a\nfew seconds, she stood there before him, and he, upon the ground at her\nfeet, looked up at her, spellbound. Then, slowly she withdrew. Still\nasleep, her eyelids closed, she turned from him, descending the slope.\nShe was gone.\n\nVanamee started up, coming, as it were, to himself, looking wildly about\nhim. Sarria was there.\n\n“I saw her,” said the priest. “It was Angele, the little girl, your\nAngele's daughter. She is like her mother.”\n\nBut Vanamee scarcely heard. He walked as if in a trance, pushing by\nSarria, going forth from the garden. Angele or Angele's daughter, it was\nall one with him. It was She. Death was overcome. The grave vanquished.\nLife, ever-renewed, alone existed. Time was naught; change was naught;\nall things were immortal but evil; all things eternal but grief.\n\nSuddenly, the dawn came; the east burned roseate toward the zenith.\nVanamee walked on, he knew not where. The dawn grew brighter. At length,\nhe paused upon the crest of a hill overlooking the ranchos, and cast his\neye below him to the southward. Then, suddenly flinging up his arms, he\nuttered a great cry.\n\nThere it was. The Wheat! The Wheat! In the night it had come up. It was\nthere, everywhere, from margin to margin of the horizon. The earth, long\nempty, teemed with green life. Once more the pendulum of the seasons\nswung in its mighty arc, from death back to life. Life out of death,\neternity rising from out dissolution. There was the lesson. Angele was\nnot the symbol, but the PROOF of immortality. The seed dying, rotting\nand corrupting in the earth; rising again in life unconquerable, and\nin immaculate purity,--Angele dying as she gave birth to her little\ndaughter, life springing from her death,--the pure, unconquerable,\ncoming forth from the defiled. Why had he not had the knowledge of God?\nThou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die. So the\nseed had died. So died Angele. And that which thou sowest, thou sowest\nnot that body that shall be, but bare grain. It may chance of wheat, or\nof some other grain. The wheat called forth from out the darkness,\nfrom out the grip of the earth, of the grave, from out corruption,\nrose triumphant into light and life. So Angele, so life, so also the\nresurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption. It is raised in\nincorruption. It is sown in dishonour. It is raised in glory. It is sown\nin weakness. It is raised in power. Death was swallowed up in Victory.\n\nThe sun rose. The night was over. The glory of the terrestrial was one,\nand the glory of the celestial was another. Then, as the glory of sun\nbanished the lesser glory of moon and stars, Vanamee, from his mountain\ntop, beholding the eternal green life of the growing Wheat, bursting its\nbonds, and in his heart exulting in his triumph over the grave, flung\nout his arms with a mighty shout:\n\n“Oh, Death, where is thy sting? Oh, Grave, where is thy victory?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nPresley's Socialistic poem, “The Toilers,” had an enormous success. The\neditor of the Sunday supplement of the San Francisco paper to which\nit was sent, printed it in Gothic type, with a scare-head title so\ndecorative as to be almost illegible, and furthermore caused the poem to\nbe illustrated by one of the paper's staff artists in a most impressive\nfashion. The whole affair occupied an entire page. Thus advertised, the\npoem attracted attention. It was promptly copied in New York, Boston,\nand Chicago papers. It was discussed, attacked, defended, eulogised,\nridiculed. It was praised with the most fulsome adulation; assailed with\nthe most violent condemnation. Editorials were written upon it. Special\narticles, in literary pamphlets, dissected its rhetoric and prosody.\nThe phrases were quoted,--were used as texts for revolutionary sermons,\nreactionary speeches. It was parodied; it was distorted so as to read as\nan advertisement for patented cereals and infants' foods. Finally,\nthe editor of an enterprising monthly magazine reprinted the poem,\nsupplementing it by a photograph and biography of Presley himself.\n\nPresley was stunned, bewildered. He began to wonder at himself. Was\nhe actually the “greatest American poet since Bryant”? He had had no\nthought of fame while composing “The Toilers.” He had only been moved\nto his heart's foundations,--thoroughly in earnest, seeing clearly,--and\nhad addressed himself to the poem's composition in a happy moment when\nwords came easily to him, and the elaboration of fine sentences was not\ndifficult. Was it thus fame was achieved? For a while he was tempted\nto cross the continent and go to New York and there come unto his own,\nenjoying the triumph that awaited him. But soon he denied himself this\ncheap reward. Now he was too much in earnest. He wanted to help his\nPeople, the community in which he lived--the little world of the San\nJoaquin, at grapples with the Railroad. The struggle had found its poet.\nHe told himself that his place was here. Only the words of the manager\nof a lecture bureau troubled him for a moment. To range the entire\nnation, telling all his countrymen of the drama that was working itself\nout on this fringe of the continent, this ignored and distant Pacific\nCoast, rousing their interest and stirring them up to action--appealed\nto him. It might do great good. To devote himself to “the Cause,”\n accepting no penny of remuneration; to give his life to loosing the grip\nof the iron-hearted monster of steel and steam would be beyond question\nheroic. Other States than California had their grievances. All over the\ncountry the family of cyclops was growing. He would declare himself the\nchampion of the People in their opposition to the Trust. He would be an\napostle, a prophet, a martyr of Freedom.\n\nBut Presley was essentially a dreamer, not a man of affairs. He\nhesitated to act at this precise psychological moment, striking while\nthe iron was yet hot, and while he hesitated, other affairs near at hand\nbegan to absorb his attention.\n\nOne night, about an hour after he had gone to bed, he was awakened by\nthe sound of voices on the porch of the ranch house, and, descending,\nfound Mrs. Dyke there with Sidney. The ex-engineer's mother was talking\nto Magnus and Harran, and crying as she talked. It seemed that Dyke was\nmissing. He had gone into town early that afternoon with the wagon and\nteam, and was to have been home for supper. By now it was ten o'clock\nand there was no news of him. Mrs. Dyke told how she first had gone\nto Quien Sabe, intending to telephone from there to Bonneville, but\nAnnixter was in San Francisco, and in his absence the house was\nlocked up, and the over-seer, who had a duplicate key, was himself\nin Bonneville. She had telegraphed three times from Guadalajara to\nBonneville for news of her son, but without result. Then, at last,\ntortured with anxiety, she had gone to Hooven's, taking Sidney with her,\nand had prevailed upon “Bismarck” to hitch up and drive her across Los\nMuertos to the Governor's, to beg him to telephone into Bonneville, to\nknow what had become of Dyke.\n\nWhile Harran rang up Central in town, Mrs. Dyke told Presley and Magnus\nof the lamentable change in Dyke.\n\n“They have broken my son's spirit, Mr. Derrick,” she said. “If you were\nonly there to see. Hour after hour, he sits on the porch with his hands\nlying open in his lap, looking at them without a word. He won't look\nme in the face any more, and he don't sleep. Night after night, he has\nwalked the floor until morning. And he will go on that way for days\ntogether, very silent, without a word, and sitting still in his chair,\nand then, all of a sudden, he will break out--oh, Mr. Derrick, it is\nterrible--into an awful rage, cursing, swearing, grinding his teeth,\nhis hands clenched over his head, stamping so that the house shakes, and\nsaying that if S. Behrman don't give him back his money, he will kill\nhim with his two hands. But that isn't the worst, Mr. Derrick. He goes\nto Mr. Caraher's saloon now, and stays there for hours, and listens\nto Mr. Caraher. There is something on my son's mind; I know there\nis--something that he and Mr. Caraher have talked over together, and\nI can't find out what it is. Mr. Caraher is a bad man, and my son has\nfallen under his influence.” The tears filled her eyes. Bravely, she\nturned to hide them, turning away to take Sidney in her arms, putting\nher head upon the little girl's shoulder.\n\n“I--I haven't broken down before, Mr. Derrick,” she said, “but after we\nhave been so happy in our little house, just us three--and the future\nseemed so bright--oh, God will punish the gentlemen who own the railroad\nfor being so hard and cruel.”\n\nHarran came out on the porch, from the telephone, and she interrupted\nherself, fixing her eyes eagerly upon him.\n\n“I think it is all right, Mrs. Dyke,” he said, reassuringly. “We know\nwhere he is, I believe. You and the little tad stay here, and Hooven and\nI will go after him.”\n\nAbout two hours later, Harran brought Dyke back to Los Muertos in\nHooven's wagon. He had found him at Caraher's saloon, very drunk.\n\nThere was nothing maudlin about Dyke's drunkenness. In him the alcohol\nmerely roused the spirit of evil, vengeful, reckless.\n\nAs the wagon passed out from under the eucalyptus trees about the ranch\nhouse, taking Mrs. Dyke, Sidney, and the one-time engineer back to the\nhop ranch, Presley leaning from his window heard the latter remark:\n\n“Caraher is right. There is only one thing they listen to, and that's\ndynamite.”\n\nThe following day Presley drove Magnus over to Guadalajara to take the\ntrain for San Francisco. But after he had said good-bye to the Governor,\nhe was moved to go on to the hop ranch to see the condition of affairs\nin that quarter. He returned to Los Muertos overwhelmed with sadness and\ntrembling with anger. The hop ranch that he had last seen in the full\ntide of prosperity was almost a ruin. Work had evidently been abandoned\nlong since. Weeds were already choking the vines. Everywhere the poles\nsagged and drooped. Many had even fallen, dragging the vines with them,\nspreading them over the ground in an inextricable tangle of dead\nleaves, decaying tendrils, and snarled string. The fence was broken;\nthe unfinished storehouse, which never was to see completion, was a\nlamentable spectacle of gaping doors and windows--a melancholy skeleton.\nLast of all, Presley had caught a glimpse of Dyke himself, seated in\nhis rocking chair on the porch, his beard and hair unkempt, motionless,\nlooking with vague eyes upon his hands that lay palm upwards and idle in\nhis lap.\n\nMagnus on his way to San Francisco was joined at Bonneville by Osterman.\nUpon seating himself in front of the master of Los Muertos in the\nsmoking-car of the train, this latter, pushing back his hat and\nsmoothing his bald head, observed:\n\n“Governor, you look all frazeled out. Anything wrong these days?”\n\nThe other answered in the negative, but, for all that, Osterman was\nright. The Governor had aged suddenly. His former erectness was\ngone, the broad shoulders stooped a little, the strong lines of his\nthin-lipped mouth were relaxed, and his hand, as it clasped over the\nyellowed ivory knob of his cane, had an unwonted tremulousness not\nhitherto noticeable. But the change in Magnus was more than physical.\nAt last, in the full tide of power, President of the League, known and\ntalked of in every county of the State, leader in a great struggle,\nconsulted, deferred to as the “Prominent Man,” at length attaining that\nposition, so long and vainly sought for, he yet found no pleasure in\nhis triumph, and little but bitterness in life. His success had come by\ndevious methods, had been reached by obscure means.\n\nHe was a briber. He could never forget that. To further his ends,\ndisinterested, public-spirited, even philanthropic as those were, he\nhad connived with knavery, he, the politician of the old school, of such\nrigorous integrity, who had abandoned a “career” rather than compromise\nwith honesty. At this eleventh hour, involved and entrapped in the\nfine-spun web of a new order of things, bewildered by Osterman's\ndexterity, by his volubility and glibness, goaded and harassed beyond\nthe point of reason by the aggression of the Trust he fought, he had at\nlast failed. He had fallen he had given a bribe. He had thought that,\nafter all, this would make but little difference with him. The affair\nwas known only to Osterman, Broderson, and Annixter; they would not\njudge him, being themselves involved. He could still preserve a bold\nfront; could still hold his head high. As time went on the affair would\nlose its point.\n\nBut this was not so. Some subtle element of his character had forsaken\nhim. He felt it. He knew it. Some certain stiffness that had given him\nall his rigidity, that had lent force to his authority, weight to his\ndominance, temper to his fine, inflexible hardness, was diminishing\nday by day. In the decisions which he, as President of the League, was\ncalled upon to make so often, he now hesitated. He could no longer\nbe arrogant, masterful, acting upon his own judgment, independent of\nopinion. He began to consult his lieutenants, asking their advice,\ndistrusting his own opinions. He made mistakes, blunders, and when those\nwere brought to his notice, took refuge in bluster. He knew it to be\nbluster--knew that sooner or later his subordinates would recognise it\nas such. How long could he maintain his position? So only he could keep\nhis grip upon the lever of control till the battle was over, all would\nbe well. If not, he would fall, and, once fallen, he knew that now,\nbriber that he was, he would never rise again.\n\nHe was on his way at this moment to the city to consult with Lyman as\nto a certain issue of the contest between the Railroad and the ranchers,\nwhich, of late, had been brought to his notice.\n\nWhen appeal had been taken to the Supreme Court by the League's\nExecutive Committee, certain test cases had been chosen, which should\nrepresent all the lands in question. Neither Magnus nor Annixter had\nso appealed, believing, of course, that their cases were covered by the\ntest cases on trial at Washington. Magnus had here blundered again, and\nthe League's agents in San Francisco had written to warn him that the\nRailroad might be able to take advantage of a technicality, and by\npretending that neither Quien Sabe nor Los Muertos were included in the\nappeal, attempt to put its dummy buyers in possession of the two ranches\nbefore the Supreme Court handed down its decision. The ninety days\nallowed for taking this appeal were nearly at an end and after then the\nRailroad could act. Osterman and Magnus at once decided to go up to the\ncity, there joining Annixter (who had been absent from Quien Sabe for\nthe last ten days), and talk the matter over with Lyman. Lyman, because\nof his position as Commissioner, might be cognisant of the Railroad's\nplans, and, at the same time, could give sound legal advice as to what\nwas to be done should the new rumour prove true.\n\n“Say,” remarked Osterman, as the train pulled out of the Bonneville\nstation, and the two men settled themselves for the long journey, “say\nGovernor, what's all up with Buck Annixter these days? He's got a bean\nabout something, sure.”\n\n“I had not noticed,” answered Magnus. “Mr. Annixter has been away\nsome time lately. I cannot imagine what should keep him so long in San\nFrancisco.”\n\n“That's it,” said Osterman, winking. “Have three guesses. Guess right\nand you get a cigar. I guess g-i-r-l spells Hilma Tree. And a little\nwhile ago she quit Quien Sabe and hiked out to 'Frisco. So did Buck.\nDo I draw the cigar? It's up to you.” “I have noticed her,” observed\nMagnus. “A fine figure of a woman. She would make some man a good wife.”\n\n“Hoh! Wife! Buck Annixter marry! Not much. He's gone a-girling at last,\nold Buck! It's as funny as twins. Have to josh him about it when I see\nhim, sure.”\n\nBut when Osterman and Magnus at last fell in with Annixter in the\nvestibule of the Lick House, on Montgomery Street, nothing could be got\nout of him. He was in an execrable humour. When Magnus had broached the\nsubject of business, he had declared that all business could go to pot,\nand when Osterman, his tongue in his cheek, had permitted himself a\nmost distant allusion to a feemale girl, Annixter had cursed him for a\n“busy-face” so vociferously and tersely, that even Osterman was cowed.\n\n“Well,” insinuated Osterman, “what are you dallying 'round 'Frisco so\nmuch for?”\n\n“Cat fur, to make kitten-breeches,” retorted Annixter with oracular\nvagueness.\n\nTwo weeks before this time, Annixter had come up to the city and\nhad gone at once to a certain hotel on Bush Street, behind the First\nNational Bank, that he knew was kept by a family connection of the\nTrees. In his conjecture that Hilma and her parents would stop here, he\nwas right. Their names were on the register. Ignoring custom, Annixter\nmarched straight up to their rooms, and before he was well aware of it,\nwas “eating crow” before old man Tree.\n\nHilma and her mother were out at the time. Later on, Mrs. Tree returned\nalone, leaving Hilma to spend the day with one of her cousins who lived\nfar out on Stanyan Street in a little house facing the park.\n\nBetween Annixter and Hilma's parents, a reconciliation had been\neffected, Annixter convincing them both of his sincerity in wishing to\nmake Hilma his wife. Hilma, however, refused to see him. As soon as\nshe knew he had followed her to San Francisco she had been unwilling\nto return to the hotel and had arranged with her cousin to spend an\nindefinite time at her house.\n\nShe was wretchedly unhappy during all this time; would not set foot out\nof doors, and cried herself to sleep night after night. She detested the\ncity. Already she was miserably homesick for the ranch. She remembered\nthe days she had spent in the little dairy-house, happy in her work,\nmaking butter and cheese; skimming the great pans of milk, scouring the\ncopper vessels and vats, plunging her arms, elbow deep, into the white\ncurds; coming and going in that atmosphere of freshness, cleanliness,\nand sunlight, gay, singing, supremely happy just because the sun shone.\nShe remembered her long walks toward the Mission late in the afternoons,\nher excursions for cresses underneath the Long Trestle, the crowing of\nthe cocks, the distant whistle of the passing trains, the faint sounding\nof the Angelus. She recalled with infinite longing the solitary expanse\nof the ranches, the level reaches between the horizons, full of light\nand silence; the heat at noon, the cloudless iridescence of the sunrise\nand sunset. She had been so happy in that life! Now, all those days were\npassed. This crude, raw city, with its crowding houses all of wood\nand tin, its blotting fogs, its uproarious trade winds, disturbed and\nsaddened her. There was no outlook for the future.\n\nAt length, one day, about a week after Annixter's arrival in the city,\nshe was prevailed upon to go for a walk in the park. She went alone,\nputting on for the first time the little hat of black straw with its\npuff of white silk her mother had bought for her, a pink shirtwaist, her\nbelt of imitation alligator skin, her new skirt of brown cloth, and her\nlow shoes, set off with their little steel buckles.\n\nShe found a tiny summer house, built in Japanese fashion, around a\ndiminutive pond, and sat there for a while, her hands folded in her lap,\namused with watching the goldfish, wishing--she knew not what.\n\nWithout any warning, Annixter sat down beside her. She was too\nfrightened to move. She looked at him with wide eyes that began to fill\nwith tears.\n\n“Oh,” she said, at last, “oh--I didn't know.”\n\n“Well,” exclaimed Annixter, “here you are at last. I've been watching\nthat blamed house till I was afraid the policeman would move me on. By\nthe Lord,” he suddenly cried, “you're pale. You--you, Hilma, do you feel\nwell?”\n\n“Yes--I am well,” she faltered.\n\n“No, you're not,” he declared. “I know better. You are coming back to\nQuien Sabe with me. This place don't agree with you. Hilma, what's\nall the matter? Why haven't you let me see you all this time? Do you\nknow--how things are with me? Your mother told you, didn't she? Do you\nknow how sorry I am? Do you know that I see now that I made the mistake\nof my life there, that time, under the Long Trestle? I found it out the\nnight after you went away. I sat all night on a stone out on the ranch\nsomewhere and I don't know exactly what happened, but I've been a\ndifferent man since then. I see things all different now. Why, I've only\nbegun to live since then. I know what love means now, and instead of\nbeing ashamed of it, I'm proud of it. If I never was to see you again I\nwould be glad I'd lived through that night, just the same. I just woke\nup that night. I'd been absolutely and completely selfish up to the\nmoment I realised I really loved you, and now, whether you'll let me\nmarry you or not, I mean to live--I don't know, in a different way. I've\nGOT to live different. I--well--oh, I can't make you understand, but\njust loving you has changed my life all around. It's made it easier\nto do the straight, clean thing. I want to do it, it's fun doing it.\nRemember, once I said I was proud of being a hard man, a driver, of\nbeing glad that people hated me and were afraid of me? Well, since I've\nloved you I'm ashamed of it all. I don't want to be hard any more, and\nnobody is going to hate me if I can help it. I'm happy and I want other\npeople so. I love you,” he suddenly exclaimed; “I love you, and if you\nwill forgive me, and if you will come down to such a beast as I am,\nI want to be to you the best a man can be to a woman, Hilma. Do you\nunderstand, little girl? I want to be your husband.”\n\nHilma looked at the goldfishes through her tears.\n\n“Have you got anything to say to me, Hilma?” he asked, after a while.\n\n“I don't know what you want me to say,” she murmured.\n\n“Yes, you do,” he insisted. “I've followed you 'way up here to hear it.\nI've waited around in these beastly, draughty picnic grounds for over a\nweek to hear it. You know what I want to hear, Hilma.”\n\n“Well--I forgive you,” she hazarded.\n\n“That will do for a starter,” he answered. “But that's not IT.”\n\n“Then, I don't know what.”\n\n“Shall I say it for you?”\n\nShe hesitated a long minute, then:\n\n“You mightn't say it right,” she replied.\n\n“Trust me for that. Shall I say it for you, Hilma?”\n\n“I don't know what you'll say.”\n\n“I'll say what you are thinking of. Shall I say it?”\n\nThere was a very long pause. A goldfish rose to the surface of the\nlittle pond, with a sharp, rippling sound. The fog drifted overhead.\nThere was nobody about.\n\n“No,” said Hilma, at length. “I--I--I can say it for myself. I--” All\nat once she turned to him and put her arms around his neck. “Oh, DO you\nlove me?” she cried. “Is it really true? Do you mean every word of it?\nAnd you are sorry and you WILL be good to me if I will be your wife? You\nwill be my dear, dear husband?”\n\nThe tears sprang to Annixter's eyes. He took her in his arms and held\nher there for a moment. Never in his life had he felt so unworthy, so\nundeserving of this clean, pure girl who forgave him and trusted his\nspoken word and believed him to be the good man he could only wish to\nbe. She was so far above him, so exalted, so noble that he should have\nbowed his forehead to her feet, and instead, she took him in her arms,\nbelieving him to be good, to be her equal. He could think of no words\nto say. The tears overflowed his eyes and ran down upon his cheeks. She\ndrew away from him and held him a second at arm's length, looking at\nhim, and he saw that she, too, had been crying.\n\n“I think,” he said, “we are a couple of softies.”\n\n“No, no,” she insisted. “I want to cry and want you to cry, too. Oh,\ndear, I haven't a handkerchief.”\n\n“Here, take mine.”\n\nThey wiped each other's eyes like two children and for a long time sat\nin the deserted little Japanese pleasure house, their arms about each\nother, talking, talking, talking.\n\nOn the following Saturday they were married in an uptown Presbyterian\nchurch, and spent the week of their honeymoon at a small, family hotel\non Sutter Street. As a matter of course, they saw the sights of the city\ntogether. They made the inevitable bridal trip to the Cliff House and\nspent an afternoon in the grewsome and made-to-order beauties of\nSutro's Gardens; they went through Chinatown, the Palace Hotel, the\npark museum--where Hilma resolutely refused to believe in the Egyptian\nmummy--and they drove out in a hired hack to the Presidio and the Golden\nGate.\n\nOn the sixth day of their excursions, Hilma abruptly declared they had\nhad enough of “playing out,” and must be serious and get to work.\n\nThis work was nothing less than the buying of the furniture and\nappointments for the rejuvenated ranch house at Quien Sabe, where they\nwere to live. Annixter had telegraphed to his overseer to have the\nbuilding repainted, replastered, and reshingled and to empty the rooms\nof everything but the telephone and safe. He also sent instructions to\nhave the dimensions of each room noted down and the result forwarded\nto him. It was the arrival of these memoranda that had roused Hilma to\naction.\n\nThen ensued a most delicious week. Armed with formidable lists, written\nby Annixter on hotel envelopes, they two descended upon the department\nstores of the city, the carpet stores, the furniture stores. Right and\nleft they bought and bargained, sending each consignment as soon as\npurchased to Quien Sabe. Nearly an entire car load of carpets, curtains,\nkitchen furniture, pictures, fixtures, lamps, straw matting, chairs, and\nthe like were sent down to the ranch, Annixter making a point that their\nnew home should be entirely equipped by San Francisco dealers.\n\nThe furnishings of the bedroom and sitting-room were left to the very\nlast. For the former, Hilma bought a “set” of pure white enamel, three\nchairs, a washstand and bureau, a marvellous bargain of thirty dollars,\ndiscovered by wonderful accident at a “Friday Sale.” The bed was a\npiece by itself, bought elsewhere, but none the less a wonder. It was of\nbrass, very brave and gay, and actually boasted a canopy! They bought\nit complete, just as it stood in the window of the department store and\nHilma was in an ecstasy over its crisp, clean, muslin curtains, spread,\nand shams. Never was there such a bed, the luxury of a princess, such a\nbed as she had dreamed about her whole life.\n\nNext the appointments of the sitting-room occupied her--since Annixter,\nhimself, bewildered by this astonishing display, unable to offer a\nsingle suggestion himself, merely approved of all she bought. In the\nsitting-room was to be a beautiful blue and white paper, cool straw\nmatting, set off with white wool rugs, a stand of flowers in the window,\na globe of goldfish, rocking chairs, a sewing machine, and a great,\nround centre table of yellow oak whereon should stand a lamp covered\nwith a deep shade of crinkly red tissue paper. On the walls were to hang\nseveral pictures--lovely affairs, photographs from life, all properly\ntinted--of choir boys in robes, with beautiful eyes; pensive young girls\nin pink gowns, with flowing yellow hair, drooping over golden harps; a\ncoloured reproduction of “Rouget de Lisle, Singing the Marseillaise,”\n and two “pieces” of wood carving, representing a quail and a wild duck,\nhung by one leg in the midst of game bags and powder horns,--quite\nmasterpieces, both.\n\nAt last everything had been bought, all arrangements made, Hilma's\ntrunks packed with her new dresses, and the tickets to Bonneville\nbought.\n\n“We'll go by the Overland, by Jingo,” declared Annixter across the\ntable to his wife, at their last meal in the hotel where they had been\nstopping; “no way trains or locals for us, hey?”\n\n“But we reach Bonneville at SUCH an hour,” protested Hilma. “Five in the\nmorning!”\n\n“Never mind,” he declared, “we'll go home in PULLMAN'S, Hilma. I'm not\ngoing to have any of those slobs in Bonneville say I didn't know how to\ndo the thing in style, and we'll have Vacca meet us with the team. No,\nsir, it is Pullman's or nothing. When it comes to buying furniture, I\ndon't shine, perhaps, but I know what's due my wife.”\n\nHe was obdurate, and late one afternoon the couple boarded the\nTranscontinental (the crack Overland Flyer of the Pacific and\nSouthwestern) at the Oakland mole. Only Hilma's parents were there to\nsay good-bye. Annixter knew that Magnus and Osterman were in the city,\nbut he had laid his plans to elude them. Magnus, he could trust to be\ndignified, but that goat Osterman, one could never tell what he would do\nnext. He did not propose to start his journey home in a shower of rice.\nAnnixter marched down the line of cars, his hands encumbered with wicker\ntelescope baskets, satchels, and valises, his tickets in his mouth, his\nhat on wrong side foremost, Hilma and her parents hurrying on behind\nhim, trying to keep up. Annixter was in a turmoil of nerves lest\nsomething should go wrong; catching a train was always for him a little\ncrisis. He rushed ahead so furiously that when he had found his Pullman\nhe had lost his party. He set down his valises to mark the place and\ncharged back along the platform, waving his arms.\n\n“Come on,” he cried, when, at length, he espied the others. “We've no\nmore time.”\n\nHe shouldered and urged them forward to where he had set his valises,\nonly to find one of them gone. Instantly he raised an outcry. Aha, a\nfine way to treat passengers! There was P. and S. W. management for\nyou. He would, by the Lord, he would--but the porter appeared in the\nvestibule of the car to placate him. He had already taken his valises\ninside.\n\nAnnixter would not permit Hilma's parents to board the car, declaring\nthat the train might pull out any moment. So he and his wife, following\nthe porter down the narrow passage by the stateroom, took their places\nand, raising the window, leaned out to say good-bye to Mr. and Mrs.\nTree. These latter would not return to Quien Sabe. Old man Tree had\nfound a business chance awaiting him in the matter of supplying his\nrelative's hotel with dairy products. But Bonneville was not too far\nfrom San Francisco; the separation was by no means final.\n\nThe porters began taking up the steps that stood by the vestibule of\neach sleeping-car.\n\n“Well, have a good time, daughter,” observed her father; “and come up to\nsee us whenever you can.”\n\nFrom beyond the enclosure of the depot's reverberating roof came the\nmeasured clang of a bell.\n\n“I guess we're off,” cried Annixter. “Good-bye, Mrs. Tree.”\n\n“Remember your promise, Hilma,” her mother hastened to exclaim, “to\nwrite every Sunday afternoon.”\n\nThere came a prolonged creaking and groan of straining wood and iron\nwork, all along the length of the train. They all began to cry their\ngood-byes at once. The train stirred, moved forward, and gathering slow\nheadway, rolled slowly out into the sunlight. Hilma leaned out of the\nwindow and as long as she could keep her mother in sight waved her\nhandkerchief. Then at length she sat back in her seat and looked at her\nhusband.\n\n“Well,” she said.\n\n“Well,” echoed Annixter, “happy?” for the tears rose in her eyes.\n\nShe nodded energetically, smiling at him bravely.\n\n“You look a little pale,” he declared, frowning uneasily; “feel well?”\n\n“Pretty well.”\n\nPromptly he was seized with uneasiness. “But not ALL well, hey? Is that\nit?”\n\nIt was true that Hilma had felt a faint tremour of seasickness on the\nferry-boat coming from the city to the Oakland mole. No doubt a little\nnausea yet remained with her. But Annixter refused to accept this\nexplanation. He was distressed beyond expression.\n\n“Now you're going to be sick,” he cried anxiously.\n\n“No, no,” she protested, “not a bit.”\n\n“But you said you didn't feel very well. Where is it you feel sick?”\n\n“I don't know. I'm not sick. Oh, dear me, why will you bother?”\n\n“Headache?”\n\n“Not the least.”\n\n“You feel tired, then. That's it. No wonder, the way rushed you 'round\nto-day.”\n\n“Dear, I'm NOT tired, and I'm NOT sick, and I'm all RIGHT.”\n\n“No, no; I can tell. I think we'd best have the berth made up and you\nlie down.”\n\n“That would be perfectly ridiculous.”\n\n“Well, where is it you feel sick? Show me; put your hand on the place.\nWant to eat something?”\n\nWith elaborate minuteness, he cross-questioned her, refusing to let the\nsubject drop, protesting that she had dark circles under her eyes; that\nshe had grown thinner.\n\n“Wonder if there's a doctor on board,” he murmured, looking uncertainly\nabout the car. “Let me see your tongue. I know--a little whiskey is what\nyou want, that and some pru----”\n\n“No, no, NO,” she exclaimed. “I'm as well as I ever was in all my life.\nLook at me. Now, tell me, do l look likee a sick lady?”\n\nHe scrutinised her face distressfully.\n\n“Now, don't I look the picture of health?” she challenged.\n\n“In a way you do,” he began, “and then again----”\n\nHilma beat a tattoo with her heels upon the floor, shutting her\nfists, the thumbs tucked inside. She closed her eyes, shaking her head\nenergetically.\n\n“I won't listen, I won't listen, I won't listen,” she cried.\n\n“But, just the same----”\n\n“Gibble--gibble--gibble,” she mocked. “I won't Listen, I won't listen.”\n She put a hand over his mouth. “Look, here's the dining-car waiter, and\nthe first call for supper, and your wife is hungry.”\n\nThey went forward and had supper in the diner, while the long train, now\nout upon the main line, settled itself to its pace, the prolonged, even\ngallop that it would hold for the better part of the week, spinning out\nthe miles as a cotton spinner spins thread.\n\nIt was already dark when Antioch was left behind. Abruptly the sunset\nappeared to wheel in the sky and readjusted itself to the right of the\ntrack behind Mount Diablo, here visible almost to its base. The train\nhad turned southward. Neroly was passed, then Brentwood, then Byron.\nIn the gathering dusk, mountains began to build themselves up on either\nhand, far off, blocking the horizon. The train shot forward, roaring.\nBetween the mountains the land lay level, cut up into farms, ranches.\nThese continually grew larger; growing wheat began to appear, billowing\nin the wind of the train's passage. The mountains grew higher, the\nland richer, and by the time the moon rose, the train was well into the\nnorthernmost limits of the valley of the San Joaquin.\n\nAnnixter had engaged an entire section, and after he and his wife went\nto bed had the porter close the upper berth. Hilma sat up in bed to\nsay her prayers, both hands over her face, and then kissing Annixter\ngood-night, went to sleep with the directness of a little child, holding\nhis hand in both her own.\n\nAnnixter, who never could sleep on the train, dozed and tossed and\nfretted for hours, consulting his watch and time-table whenever there\nwas a stop; twice he rose to get a drink of ice water, and between\nwhiles was forever sitting up in the narrow berth, stretching himself\nand yawning, murmuring with uncertain relevance:\n\n“Oh, Lord! Oh-h-h LORD!”\n\nThere were some dozen other passengers in the car--a lady with three\nchildren, a group of school-teachers, a couple of drummers, a stout\ngentleman with whiskers, and a well-dressed young man in a plaid\ntravelling cap, whom Annixter had observed before supper time reading\nDaudet's “Tartarin” in the French.\n\nBut by nine o'clock, all these people were in their berths.\nOccasionally, above the rhythmic rumble of the wheels, Annixter could\nhear one of the lady's children fidgeting and complaining. The stout\ngentleman snored monotonously in two notes, one a rasping bass, the\nother a prolonged treble. At intervals, a brakeman or the passenger\nconductor pushed down the aisle, between the curtains, his red and\nwhite lamp over his arm. Looking out into the car Annixter saw in an end\nsection where the berths had not been made up, the porter, in his white\nduck coat, dozing, his mouth wide open, his head on his shoulder.\n\nThe hours passed. Midnight came and went. Annixter, checking off the\nstations, noted their passage of Modesto, Merced, and Madeira. Then,\nafter another broken nap, he lost count. He wondered where they were.\nHad they reached Fresno yet? Raising the window curtain, he made a shade\nwith both hands on either side of his face and looked out. The night was\nthick, dark, clouded over. A fine rain was falling, leaving horizontal\nstreaks on the glass of the outside window. Only the faintest grey blur\nindicated the sky. Everything else was impenetrable blackness.\n\n“I think sure we must have passed Fresno,” he muttered. He looked at his\nwatch. It was about half-past three. “If we have passed Fresno,” he said\nto himself, “I'd better wake the little girl pretty soon. She'll need\nabout an hour to dress. Better find out for sure.”\n\nHe drew on his trousers and shoes, got into his coat, and stepped out\ninto the aisle. In the seat that had been occupied by the porter,\nthe Pullman conductor, his cash box and car-schedules before him, was\nchecking up his berths, a blue pencil behind his ear.\n\n“What's the next stop, Captain?” inquired Annixter, coming up. “Have we\nreached Fresno yet?”\n\n“Just passed it,” the other responded, looking at Annixter over his\nspectacles.\n\n“What's the next stop?”\n\n“Goshen. We will be there in about forty-five minutes.”\n\n“Fair black night, isn't it?”\n\n“Black as a pocket. Let's see, you're the party in upper and lower 9.”\n\nAnnixter caught at the back of the nearest seat, just in time to prevent\na fall, and the conductor's cash box was shunted off the surface of the\nplush seat and came clanking to the floor. The Pintsch lights overhead\nvibrated with blinding rapidity in the long, sliding jar that ran\nthrough the train from end to end, and the momentum of its speed\nsuddenly decreasing, all but pitched the conductor from his seat. A\nhideous ear-splitting rasp made itself heard from the clamped-down\nWestinghouse gear underneath, and Annixter knew that the wheels had\nceased to revolve and that the train was sliding forward upon the\nmotionless flanges.\n\n“Hello, hello,” he exclaimed, “what's all up now?”\n\n“Emergency brakes,” declared the conductor, catching up his cash box and\nthrusting his papers and tickets into it. “Nothing much; probably a cow\non the track.”\n\nHe disappeared, carrying his lantern with him.\n\nBut the other passengers, all but the stout gentleman, were awake; heads\nwere thrust from out the curtains, and Annixter, hurrying back to Hilma,\nwas assailed by all manner of questions.\n\n“What was that?”\n\n“Anything wrong?”\n\n“What's up, anyways?”\n\nHilma was just waking as Annixter pushed the curtain aside.\n\n“Oh, I was so frightened. What's the matter, dear?” she exclaimed.\n\n“I don't know,” he answered. “Only the emergency brakes. Just a cow on\nthe track, I guess. Don't get scared. It isn't anything.”\n\nBut with a final shriek of the Westinghouse appliance, the train came to\na definite halt.\n\nAt once the silence was absolute. The ears, still numb with the\nlong-continued roar of wheels and clashing iron, at first refused to\nregister correctly the smaller noises of the surroundings. Voices came\nfrom the other end of the car, strange and unfamiliar, as though heard\nat a great distance across the water. The stillness of the night outside\nwas so profound that the rain, dripping from the car roof upon the\nroad-bed underneath, was as distinct as the ticking of a clock.\n\n“Well, we've sure stopped,” observed one of the drummers.\n\n“What is it?” asked Hilma again. “Are you sure there's nothing wrong?”\n\n“Sure,” said Annixter. Outside, underneath their window, they heard the\nsound of hurried footsteps crushing into the clinkers by the side of the\nties. They passed on, and Annixter heard some one in the distance shout:\n\n“Yes, on the other side.”\n\nThen the door at the end of their car opened and a brakeman with a red\nbeard ran down the aisle and out upon the platform in front. The forward\ndoor closed. Everything was quiet again. In the stillness the fat\ngentleman's snores made themselves heard once more.\n\nThe minutes passed; nothing stirred. There was no sound but the dripping\nrain. The line of cars lay immobilised and inert under the night. One of\nthe drummers, having stepped outside on the platform for a look around,\nreturned, saying:\n\n“There sure isn't any station anywheres about and no siding. Bet you\nthey have had an accident of some kind.”\n\n“Ask the porter.”\n\n“I did. He don't know.”\n\n“Maybe they stopped to take on wood or water, or something.”\n\n“Well, they wouldn't use the emergency brakes for that, would they? Why,\nthis train stopped almost in her own length. Pretty near slung me out\nthe berth. Those were the emergency brakes. I heard some one say so.”\n\nFrom far out towards the front of the train, near the locomotive,\ncame the sharp, incisive report of a revolver; then two more almost\nsimultaneously; then, after a long interval, a fourth.\n\n“Say, that's SHOOTING. By God, boys, they're shooting. Say, this is a\nhold-up.”\n\nInstantly a white-hot excitement flared from end to end of the\ncar. Incredibly sinister, heard thus in the night, and in the rain,\nmysterious, fearful, those four pistol shots started confusion from out\nthe sense of security like a frightened rabbit hunted from her burrow.\nWide-eyed, the passengers of the car looked into each other's faces. It\nhad come to them at last, this, they had so often read about. Now they\nwere to see the real thing, now they were to face actuality, face this\ndanger of the night, leaping in from out the blackness of the roadside,\nmasked, armed, ready to kill. They were facing it now. They were held\nup.\n\nHilma said nothing, only catching Annixter's hand, looking squarely into\nhis eyes.\n\n“Steady, little girl,” he said. “They can't hurt you. I won't leave you.\nBy the Lord,” he suddenly exclaimed, his excitement getting the better\nof him for a moment. “By the Lord, it's a hold-up.”\n\nThe school-teachers were in the aisle of the car, in night gown,\nwrapper, and dressing sack, huddled together like sheep, holding on to\neach other, looking to the men, silently appealing for protection. Two\nof them were weeping, white to the lips.\n\n“Oh, oh, oh, it's terrible. Oh, if they only won't hurt me.”\n\nBut the lady with the children looked out from her berth, smiled\nreassuringly, and said:\n\n“I'm not a bit frightened. They won't do anything to us if we keep\nquiet. I've my watch and jewelry all ready for them in my little black\nbag, see?”\n\nShe exhibited it to the passengers. Her children were all awake. They\nwere quiet, looking about them with eager faces, interested and amused\nat this surprise. In his berth, the fat gentleman with whiskers snored\nprofoundly.\n\n“Say, I'm going out there,” suddenly declared one of the drummers,\nflourishing a pocket revolver.\n\nHis friend caught his arm.\n\n“Don't make a fool of yourself, Max,” he said.\n\n“They won't come near us,” observed the well-dressed young man; “they\nare after the Wells-Fargo box and the registered mail. You won't do any\ngood out there.”\n\nBut the other loudly protested. No; he was going out. He didn't propose\nto be buncoed without a fight. He wasn't any coward.\n\n“Well, you don't go, that's all,” said his friend, angrily. “There's\nwomen and children in this car. You ain't going to draw the fire here.”\n\n“Well, that's to be thought of,” said the other, allowing himself to be\npacified, but still holding his pistol.\n\n“Don't let him open that window,” cried Annixter sharply from his place\nby Hilma's side, for the drummer had made as if to open the sash in one\nof the sections that had not been made up.\n\n“Sure, that's right,” said the others. “Don't open any windows. Keep\nyour head in. You'll get us all shot if you aren't careful.”\n\nHowever, the drummer had got the window up and had leaned out before the\nothers could interfere and draw him away.\n\n“Say, by jove,” he shouted, as he turned back to the car, “our engine's\ngone. We're standing on a curve and you can see the end of the train.\nShe's gone, I tell you. Well, look for yourself.”\n\nIn spite of their precautions, one after another, his friends looked\nout. Sure enough, the train was without a locomotive.\n\n“They've done it so we can't get away,” vociferated the drummer with\nthe pistol. “Now, by jiminy-Christmas, they'll come through the cars and\nstand us up. They'll be in here in a minute. LORD! WHAT WAS THAT?”\n\nFrom far away up the track, apparently some half-mile ahead of the\ntrain, came the sound of a heavy explosion. The windows of the car\nvibrated with it.\n\n“Shooting again.”\n\n“That isn't shooting,” exclaimed Annixter. “They've pulled the express\nand mail car on ahead with the engine and now they are dynamiting her\nopen.”\n\n“That must be it. Yes, sure, that's just what they are doing.”\n\nThe forward door of the car opened and closed and the school-teachers\nshrieked and cowered. The drummer with the revolver faced about, his\neyes bulging. However, it was only the train conductor, hatless, his\nlantern in his hand. He was soaked with rain. He appeared in the aisle.\n\n“Is there a doctor in this car?” he asked.\n\nPromptly the passengers surrounded him, voluble with questions. But he\nwas in a bad temper.\n\n“I don't know anything more than you,” he shouted angrily. “It was a\nhold-up. I guess you know that, don't you? Well, what more do you want\nto know? I ain't got time to fool around. They cut off our express car\nand have cracked it open, and they shot one of our train crew, that's\nall, and I want a doctor.”\n\n“Did they shoot him--kill him, do you mean?”\n\n“Is he hurt bad?”\n\n“Did the men get away?”\n\n“Oh, shut up, will you all?” exclaimed the conductor.\n\n“What do I know? Is there a DOCTOR in this car, that's what I want to\nknow?”\n\nThe well-dressed young man stepped forward.\n\n“I'm a doctor,” he said. “Well, come along then,” returned the\nconductor, in a surly voice, “and the passengers in this car,” he added,\nturning back at the door and nodding his head menacingly, “will go back\nto bed and STAY there. It's all over and there's nothing to see.”\n\nHe went out, followed by the young doctor.\n\nThen ensued an interminable period of silence. The entire train seemed\ndeserted. Helpless, bereft of its engine, a huge, decapitated monster it\nlay, half-way around a curve, rained upon, abandoned.\n\nThere was more fear in this last condition of affairs, more terror\nin the idea of this prolonged line of sleepers, with their nickelled\nfittings, their plate glass, their upholstery, vestibules, and the like,\nloaded down with people, lost and forgotten in the night and the rain,\nthan there had been when the actual danger threatened.\n\nWhat was to become of them now? Who was there to help them? Their engine\nwas gone; they were helpless. What next was to happen?\n\nNobody came near the car. Even the porter had disappeared. The wait\nseemed endless, and the persistent snoring of the whiskered gentleman\nrasped the nerves like the scrape of a file.\n\n“Well, how long are we going to stick here now?” began one of the\ndrummers. “Wonder if they hurt the engine with their dynamite?”\n\n“Oh, I know they will come through the car and rob us,” wailed the\nschool-teachers.\n\nThe lady with the little children went back to bed, and Annixter,\nassured that the trouble was over, did likewise. But nobody slept. From\nberth to berth came the sound of suppressed voices talking it all over,\nformulating conjectures. Certain points seemed to be settled upon, no\none knew how, as indisputable. The highwaymen had been four in number\nand had stopped the train by pulling the bell cord. A brakeman had\nattempted to interfere and had been shot. The robbers had been on the\ntrain all the way from San Francisco. The drummer named Max remembered\nto have seen four “suspicious-looking characters” in the smoking-car\nat Lathrop, and had intended to speak to the conductor about them. This\ndrummer had been in a hold-up before, and told the story of it over and\nover again.\n\nAt last, after what seemed to have been an hour's delay, and when the\ndawn had already begun to show in the east, the locomotive backed on to\nthe train again with a reverberating jar that ran from car to car. At\nthe jolting, the school-teachers screamed in chorus, and the whiskered\ngentleman stopped snoring and thrust his head from his curtains,\nblinking at the Pintsch lights. It appeared that he was an Englishman.\n\n“I say,” he asked of the drummer named Max, “I say, my friend, what\nplace is this?”\n\nThe others roared with derision.\n\n“We were HELD UP, sir, that's what we were. We were held up and you\nslept through it all. You missed the show of your life.”\n\nThe gentleman fixed the group with a prolonged gaze. He said never a\nword, but little by little he was convinced that the drummers told the\ntruth. All at once he grew wrathful, his face purpling. He withdrew his\nhead angrily, buttoning his curtains together in a fury. The cause of\nhis rage was inexplicable, but they could hear him resettling himself\nupon his pillows with exasperated movements of his head and shoulders.\nIn a few moments the deep bass and shrill treble of his snoring once\nmore sounded through the car.\n\nAt last the train got under way again, with useless warning blasts of\nthe engine's whistle. In a few moments it was tearing away through\nthe dawn at a wonderful speed, rocking around curves, roaring across\nculverts, making up time.\n\nAnd all the rest of that strange night the passengers, sitting up in\ntheir unmade beds, in the swaying car, lighted by a strange mingling of\npallid dawn and trembling Pintsch lights, rushing at break-neck speed\nthrough the misty rain, were oppressed by a vision of figures of terror,\nfar behind them in the night they had left, masked, armed, galloping\ntoward the mountains pistol in hand, the booty bound to the saddle\nbow, galloping, galloping on, sending a thrill of fear through all the\ncountry side.\n\nThe young doctor returned. He sat down in the smoking-room, lighting a\ncigarette, and Annixter and the drummers pressed around him to know the\nstory of the whole affair.\n\n“The man is dead,” he declared, “the brakeman. He was shot through the\nlungs twice. They think the fellow got away with about five thousand in\ngold coin.”\n\n“The fellow? Wasn't there four of them?”\n\n“No; only one. And say, let me tell you, he had his nerve with him. It\nseems he was on the roof of the express car all the time, and going as\nfast as we were, he jumped from the roof of the car down on to the coal\non the engine's tender, and crawled over that and held up the men in the\ncab with his gun, took their guns from 'em and made 'em stop the train.\nEven ordered 'em to use the emergency gear, seems he knew all about it.\nThen he went back and uncoupled the express car himself.\n\n“While he was doing this, a brakeman--you remember that brakeman that\ncame through here once or twice--had a red mustache.”\n\n“THAT chap?” “Sure. Well, as soon as the train stopped, this brakeman\nguessed something was wrong and ran up, saw the fellow cutting off the\nexpress car and took a couple of shots at him, and the fireman says\nthe fellow didn't even take his hand off the coupling-pin; just turned\naround as cool as how-do-you-do and NAILED the brakeman right there.\nThey weren't five feet apart when they began shooting. The brakeman had\ncome on him unexpected, had no idea he was so close.”\n\n“And the express messenger, all this time?”\n\n“Well, he did his best. Jumped out with his repeating shot-gun, but the\nfellow had him covered before he could turn round. Held him up and took\nhis gun away from him. Say, you know I call that nerve, just the same.\nOne man standing up a whole train-load, like that. Then, as soon as he'd\ncut the express car off, he made the engineer run her up the track about\nhalf a mile to a road crossing, WHERE HE HAD A HORSE TIED. What do you\nthink of that? Didn't he have it all figured out close? And when he got\nthere, he dynamited the safe and got the Wells-Fargo box. He took five\nthousand in gold coin; the messenger says it was railroad money that the\ncompany were sending down to Bakersfield to pay off with. It was in a\nbag. He never touched the registered mail, nor a whole wad of greenbacks\nthat were in the safe, but just took the coin, got on his horse, and lit\nout. The engineer says he went to the east'ard.”\n\n“He got away, did he?”\n\n“Yes, but they think they'll get him. He wore a kind of mask, but the\nbrakeman recognised him positively. We got his ante-mortem statement.\nThe brakeman said the fellow had a grudge against the road. He was a\ndischarged employee, and lives near Bonneville.”\n\n“Dyke, by the Lord!” exclaimed Annixter.\n\n“That's the name,” said the young doctor.\n\nWhen the train arrived at Bonneville, forty minutes behind time, it\nlanded Annixter and Hilma in the midst of the very thing they most\nwished to avoid--an enormous crowd. The news that the Overland had been\nheld up thirty miles south of Fresno, a brakeman killed and the safe\nlooted, and that Dyke alone was responsible for the night's work,\nhad been wired on ahead from Fowler, the train conductor throwing the\ndespatch to the station agent from the flying train.\n\nBefore the train had come to a standstill under the arched roof of the\nBonneville depot, it was all but taken by assault. Annixter, with Hilma\non his arm, had almost to fight his way out of the car. The depot was\nblack with people. S. Behrman was there, Delaney, Cyrus Ruggles, the\ntown marshal, the mayor. Genslinger, his hat on the back of his\nhead, ranged the train from cab to rear-lights, note-book in hand,\ninterviewing, questioning, collecting facts for his extra. As Annixter\ndescended finally to the platform, the editor, alert as a black-and-tan\nterrier, his thin, osseous hands quivering with eagerness, his brown,\ndry face working with excitement, caught his elbow.\n\n“Can I have your version of the affair, Mr. Annixter?”\n\nAnnixter turned on him abruptly.\n\n“Yes!” he exclaimed fiercely. “You and your gang drove Dyke from his job\nbecause he wouldn't work for starvation wages. Then you raised freight\nrates on him and robbed him of all he had. You ruined him and drove him\nto fill himself up with Caraher's whiskey. He's only taken back what you\nplundered him of, and now you're going to hound him over the State,\nhunt him down like a wild animal, and bring him to the gallows at San\nQuentin. That's my version of the affair, Mister Genslinger, but it's\nworth your subsidy from the P. and S. W. to print it.”\n\nThere was a murmur of approval from the crowd that stood around, and\nGenslinger, with an angry shrug of one shoulder, took himself away.\n\nAt length, Annixter brought Hilma through the crowd to where young Vacca\nwas waiting with the team. However, they could not at once start for\nthe ranch, Annixter wishing to ask some questions at the freight office\nabout a final consignment of chairs. It was nearly eleven o'clock before\nthey could start home. But to gain the Upper Road to Quien Sabe, it was\nnecessary to traverse all of Main Street, running through the heart of\nBonneville.\n\nThe entire town seemed to be upon the sidewalks. By now the rain was\nover and the sun shining. The story of the hold-up--the work of a man\nwhom every one knew and liked--was in every mouth. How had Dyke come to\ndo it? Who would have believed it of him? Think of his poor mother\nand the little tad. Well, after all, he was not so much to blame; the\nrailroad people had brought it on themselves. But he had shot a man\nto death. Ah, that was a serious business. Good-natured, big,\nbroad-shouldered, jovial Dyke, the man they knew, with whom they had\nshaken hands only yesterday, yes, and drank with him. He had shot a man,\nkilled him, had stood there in the dark and in the rain while they\nwere asleep in their beds, and had killed a man. Now where was he?\nInstinctively eyes were turned eastward, over the tops of the houses,\nor down vistas of side streets to where the foot-hills of the mountains\nrose dim and vast over the edge of the valley. He was in amongst them;\nsomewhere, in all that pile of blue crests and purple canyons he was\nhidden away. Now for weeks of searching, false alarms, clews, trailings,\nwatchings, all the thrill and heart-bursting excitement of a man-hunt.\nWould he get away? Hardly a man on the sidewalks of the town that day\nwho did not hope for it.\n\nAs Annixter's team trotted through the central portion of the town,\nyoung Vacca pointed to a denser and larger crowd around the rear\nentrance of the City Hall. Fully twenty saddle horses were tied to\nthe iron rail underneath the scant, half-grown trees near by, and as\nAnnixter and Hilma drove by, the crowd parted and a dozen men with\nrevolvers on their hips pushed their way to the curbstone, and, mounting\ntheir horses, rode away at a gallop.\n\n“It's the posse,” said young Vacca.\n\nOutside the town limits the ground was level. There was nothing to\nobstruct the view, and to the north, in the direction of Osterman's\nranch, Vacca made out another party of horsemen, galloping eastward, and\nbeyond these still another.\n\n“There're the other posses,” he announced. “That further one is Archie\nMoore's. He's the sheriff. He came down from Visalia on a special engine\nthis morning.”\n\nWhen the team turned into the driveway to the ranch house, Hilma uttered\na little cry, clasping her hands joyfully. The house was one glitter\nof new white paint, the driveway had been freshly gravelled, the\nflower-beds replenished. Mrs. Vacca and her daughter, who had been busy\nputting on the finishing touches, came to the door to welcome them.\n\n“What's this case here?” asked Annixter, when, after helping his wife\nfrom the carry-all, his eye fell upon a wooden box of some three by five\nfeet that stood on the porch and bore the red Wells-Fargo label.\n\n“It came here last night, addressed to you, sir,” exclaimed Mrs. Vacca.\n“We were sure it wasn't any of your furniture, so we didn't open it.”\n\n“Oh, maybe it's a wedding present,” exclaimed Hilma, her eyes sparkling.\n\n“Well, maybe it is,” returned her husband. “Here, m' son, help me in\nwith this.”\n\nAnnixter and young Vacca bore the case into the sitting-room of the\nhouse, and Annixter, hammer in hand, attacked it vigorously. Vacca\ndiscreetly withdrew on signal from his mother, closing the door after\nhim. Annixter and his wife were left alone.\n\n“Oh, hurry, hurry,” cried Hilma, dancing around him.\n\n“I want to see what it is. Who do you suppose could have sent it to us?\nAnd so heavy, too. What do you think it can be?”\n\nAnnixter put the claw of the hammer underneath the edge of the board top\nand wrenched with all his might. The boards had been clamped together by\na transverse bar and the whole top of the box came away in one piece.\nA layer of excelsior was disclosed, and on it a letter addressed by\ntypewriter to Annixter. It bore the trade-mark of a business firm of Los\nAngeles. Annixter glanced at this and promptly caught it up before Hilma\ncould see, with an exclamation of intelligence.\n\n“Oh, I know what this is,” he observed, carelessly trying to restrain\nher busy hands. “It isn't anything. Just some machinery. Let it go.”\n But already she had pulled away the excelsior. Underneath, in temporary\nracks, were two dozen Winchester repeating rifles.\n\n“Why--what--what--” murmured Hilma blankly.\n\n“Well, I told you not to mind,” said Annixter. “It isn't anything. Let's\nlook through the rooms.”\n\n“But you said you knew what it was,” she protested, bewildered. “You\nwanted to make believe it was machinery. Are you keeping anything from\nme? Tell me what it all means. Oh, why are you getting--these?”\n\nShe caught his arm, looking with intense eagerness into his face. She\nhalf understood already. Annixter saw that.\n\n“Well,” he said, lamely, “YOU know--it may not come to anything at all,\nbut you know--well, this League of ours--suppose the Railroad tries to\njump Quien Sabe or Los Muertos or any of the other ranches--we made up\nour minds--the Leaguers have--that we wouldn't let it. That's all.”\n\n“And I thought,” cried Hilma, drawing back fearfully from the case of\nrifles, “and I thought it was a wedding present.”\n\nAnd that was their home-coming, the end of their bridal trip. Through\nthe terror of the night, echoing with pistol shots, through that scene\nof robbery and murder, into this atmosphere of alarms, a man-hunt\norganising, armed horsemen silhouetted against the horizons, cases of\nrifles where wedding presents should have been, Annixter brought his\nyoung wife to be mistress of a home he might at any moment be called\nupon to defend with his life.\n\nThe days passed. Soon a week had gone by. Magnus Derrick and Osterman\nreturned from the city without any definite idea as to the Corporation's\nplans. Lyman had been reticent. He knew nothing as to the progress of\nthe land cases in Washington. There was no news. The Executive Committee\nof the League held a perfunctory meeting at Los Muertos at which nothing\nbut routine business was transacted. A scheme put forward by Osterman\nfor a conference with the railroad managers fell through because of the\nrefusal of the company to treat with the ranchers upon any other basis\nthan that of the new grading. It was impossible to learn whether or not\nthe company considered Los Muertos, Quien Sabe, and the ranches around\nBonneville covered by the test cases then on appeal.\n\nMeanwhile there was no decrease in the excitement that Dyke's hold-up\nhad set loose over all the county. Day after day it was the one topic of\nconversation, at street corners, at cross-roads, over dinner tables, in\noffice, bank, and store. S. Behrman placarded the town with a notice\nof $500.00 reward for the ex-engineer's capture, dead or alive, and the\nexpress company supplemented this by another offer of an equal amount.\nThe country was thick with parties of horsemen, armed with rifles\nand revolvers, recruited from Visalia, Goshen, and the few railroad\nsympathisers around Bonneville and Guadlajara. One after another of\nthese returned, empty-handed, covered with dust and mud, their horses\nexhausted, to be met and passed by fresh posses starting out to continue\nthe pursuit. The sheriff of Santa Clara County sent down his bloodhounds\nfrom San Jose--small, harmless-looking dogs, with a terrific bay--to\nhelp in the chase. Reporters from the San Francisco papers appeared,\ninterviewing every one, sometimes even accompanying the searching bands.\nHorse hoofs clattered over the roads at night; bells were rung, the\n“Mercury” issued extra after extra; the bloodhounds bayed, gun butts\nclashed on the asphalt pavements of Bonneville; accidental discharges of\nrevolvers brought the whole town into the street; farm hands called\nto each other across the fences of ranch-divisions--in a word, the\ncountry-side was in an uproar.\n\nAnd all to no effect. The hoof-marks of Dyke's horse had been traced in\nthe mud of the road to within a quarter of a mile of the foot-hills and\nthere irretrievably lost. Three days after the hold-up, a sheep-herder\nwas found who had seen the highwayman on a ridge in the higher\nmountains, to the northeast of Taurusa. And that was absolutely all.\nRumours were thick, promising clews were discovered, new trails taken\nup, but nothing transpired to bring the pursuers and pursued any closer\ntogether. Then, after ten days of strain, public interest began to flag.\nIt was believed that Dyke had succeeded in getting away. If this was\ntrue, he had gone to the southward, after gaining the mountains, and\nit would be his intention to work out of the range somewhere near the\nsouthern part of the San Joaquin, near Bakersfield. Thus, the sheriffs,\nmarshals, and deputies decided. They had hunted too many criminals in\nthese mountains before not to know the usual courses taken. In time,\nDyke MUST come out of the mountains to get water and provisions. But\nthis time passed, and from not one of the watched points came any word\nof his appearance. At last the posses began to disband. Little by little\nthe pursuit was given up.\n\nOnly S. Behrman persisted. He had made up his mind to bring Dyke in. He\nsucceeded in arousing the same degree of determination in Delaney--by\nnow, a trusted aide of the Railroad--and of his own cousin, a real\nestate broker, named Christian, who knew the mountains and had once been\nmarshal of Visalia in the old stock-raising days. These two went into\nthe Sierras, accompanied by two hired deputies, and carrying with them a\nmonth's provisions and two of the bloodhounds loaned by the Santa Clara\nsheriff.\n\nOn a certain Sunday, a few days after the departure of Christian and\nDelaney, Annixter, who had been reading “David Copperfield” in his\nhammock on the porch of the ranch house, put down the book and went to\nfind Hilma, who was helping Louisa Vacca set the table for dinner. He\nfound her in the dining-room, her hands full of the gold-bordered china\nplates, only used on special occasions and which Louisa was forbidden to\ntouch.\n\nHis wife was more than ordinarily pretty that day. She wore a dress of\nflowered organdie over pink sateen with pink ribbons about her waist and\nneck, and on her slim feet the low shoes she always affected, with their\nsmart, bright buckles. Her thick, brown, sweet-smelling hair was\nheaped high upon her head and set off with a bow of black velvet, and\nunderneath the shadow of its coils, her wide-open eyes, rimmed with\nthe thin, black line of her lashes, shone continually, reflecting\nthe sunlight. Marriage had only accentuated the beautiful maturity of\nHilma's figure--now no longer precocious--defining the single, deep\nswell from her throat to her waist, the strong, fine amplitude of her\nhips, the sweet feminine undulation of her neck and shoulders. Her\ncheeks were pink with health, and her large round arms carried the\npiled-up dishes with never a tremour. Annixter, observant enough where\nhis wife was concerned noted how the reflection of the white china set a\nglow of pale light underneath her chin.\n\n“Hilma,” he said, “I've been wondering lately about things. We're so\nblamed happy ourselves it won't do for us to forget about other people\nwho are down, will it? Might change our luck. And I'm just likely to\nforget that way, too. It's my nature.”\n\nHis wife looked up at him joyfully. Here was the new Annixter,\ncertainly.\n\n“In all this hullabaloo about Dyke,” he went on “there's some one nobody\nain't thought about at all. That's MRS. Dyke--and the little tad. I\nwouldn't be surprised if they were in a hole over there. What do you\nsay we drive over to the hop ranch after dinner and see if she wants\nanything?”\n\nHilma put down the plates and came around the table and kissed him\nwithout a word.\n\nAs soon as their dinner was over, Annixter had the carry-all hitched\nup, and, dispensing with young Vacca, drove over to the hop ranch with\nHilma.\n\nHilma could not keep back the tears as they passed through the\nlamentable desolation of the withered, brown vines, symbols of perished\nhopes and abandoned effort, and Annixter swore between his teeth.\n\nThough the wheels of the carry-all grated loudly on the roadway in front\nof the house, nobody came to the door nor looked from the windows. The\nplace seemed tenantless, infinitely lonely, infinitely sad. Annixter\ntied the team, and with Hilma approached the wide-open door, scuffling\nand tramping on the porch to attract attention. Nobody stirred. A Sunday\nstillness pervaded the place. Outside, the withered hop-leaves rustled\nlike dry paper in the breeze. The quiet was ominous. They peered into\nthe front room from the doorway, Hilma holding her husband's hand. Mrs.\nDyke was there. She sat at the table in the middle of the room, her\nhead, with its white hair, down upon her arm. A clutter of unwashed\ndishes were strewed over the red and white tablecloth. The unkempt room,\nonce a marvel of neatness, had not been cleaned for days. Newspapers,\nGenslinger's extras and copies of San Francisco and Los Angeles dailies\nwere scattered all over the room. On the table itself were crumpled\nyellow telegrams, a dozen of them, a score of them, blowing about in the\ndraught from the door. And in the midst of all this disarray, surrounded\nby the published accounts of her son's crime, the telegraphed answers\nto her pitiful appeals for tidings fluttering about her head, the\nhighwayman's mother, worn out, abandoned and forgotten, slept through\nthe stillness of the Sunday afternoon.\n\nNeither Hilma nor Annixter ever forgot their interview with Mrs. Dyke\nthat day. Suddenly waking, she had caught sight of Annixter, and at once\nexclaimed eagerly:\n\n“Is there any news?”\n\nFor a long time afterwards nothing could be got from her. She was numb\nto all other issues than the one question of Dyke's capture. She did not\nanswer their questions nor reply to their offers of assistance. Hilma\nand Annixter conferred together without lowering their voices, at her\nvery elbow, while she looked vacantly at the floor, drawing one hand\nover the other in a persistent, maniacal gesture. From time to time she\nwould start suddenly from her chair, her eyes wide, and as if all at\nonce realising Annixter's presence, would cry out:\n\n“Is there any news?”\n\n“Where is Sidney, Mrs. Dyke?” asked Hilma for the fourth time. “Is she\nwell? Is she taken care of?”\n\n“Here's the last telegram,” said Mrs. Dyke, in a loud, monotonous voice.\n“See, it says there is no news. He didn't do it,” she moaned, rocking\nherself back and forth, drawing one hand over the other, “he didn't do\nit, he didn't do it, he didn't do it. I don't know where he is.”\n\nWhen at last she came to herself, it was with a flood of tears. Hilma\nput her arms around the poor, old woman, as she bowed herself again upon\nthe table, sobbing and weeping.\n\n“Oh, my son, my son,” she cried, “my own boy, my only son! If I could\nhave died for you to have prevented this. I remember him when he was\nlittle. Such a splendid little fellow, so brave, so loving, with never\nan unkind thought, never a mean action. So it was all his life. We were\nnever apart. It was always 'dear little son,' and 'dear mammy' between\nus--never once was he unkind, and he loved me and was the gentlest\nson to me. And he was a GOOD man. He is now, he is now. They don't\nunderstand him. They are not even sure that he did this. He never\nmeant it. They don't know my son. Why, he wouldn't have hurt a kitten.\nEverybody loved him. He was driven to it. They hounded him down, they\nwouldn't let him alone. He was not right in his mind. They hounded him\nto it,” she cried fiercely, “they hounded him to it. They drove him and\ngoaded him till he couldn't stand it any longer, and now they mean to\nkill him for turning on them. They are hunting him with dogs; night\nafter night I have stood on the porch and heard the dogs baying far off.\nThey are tracking my boy with dogs like a wild animal. May God never\nforgive them.” She rose to her feet, terrible, her white hair unbound.\n“May God punish them as they deserve, may they never prosper--on my\nknees I shall pray for it every night--may their money be a curse to\nthem, may their sons, their first-born, only sons, be taken from them in\ntheir youth.”\n\nBut Hilma interrupted, begging her to be silent, to be quiet. The tears\ncame again then and the choking sobs. Hilma took her in her arms.\n\n“Oh, my little boy, my little boy,” she cried. “My only son, all that I\nhad, to have come to this! He was not right in his mind or he would have\nknown it would break my heart. Oh, my son, my son, if I could have died\nfor you.”\n\nSidney came in, clinging to her dress, weeping, imploring her not to\ncry, protesting that they never could catch her papa, that he would come\nback soon. Hilma took them both, the little child and the broken-down\nold woman, in the great embrace of her strong arms, and they all three\nsobbed together.\n\nAnnixter stood on the porch outside, his back turned, looking straight\nbefore him into the wilderness of dead vines, his teeth shut hard, his\nlower lip thrust out.\n\n“I hope S. Behrman is satisfied with all this,” he muttered. “I hope he\nis satisfied now, damn his soul!”\n\nAll at once an idea occurred to him. He turned about and reentered the\nroom.\n\n“Mrs Dyke,” he began, “I want you and Sidney to come over and live at\nQuien Sabe. I know--you can't make me believe that the reporters and\nofficers and officious busy-faces that pretend to offer help just so as\nthey can satisfy their curiosity aren't nagging you to death. I want you\nto let me take care of you and the little tad till all this trouble of\nyours is over with. There's plenty of place for you. You can have the\nhouse my wife's people used to live in. You've got to look these things\nin the face. What are you going to do to get along? You must be very\nshort of money. S. Behrman will foreclose on you and take the whole\nplace in a little while, now. I want you to let me help you, let Hilma\nand me be good friends to you. It would be a privilege.”\n\nMrs. Dyke tried bravely to assume her pride, insisting that she could\nmanage, but her spirit was broken. The whole affair ended unexpectedly,\nwith Annixter and Hilma bringing Dyke's mother and little girl back to\nQuien Sabe in the carry-all.\n\nMrs. Dyke would not take with her a stick of furniture nor a single\nornament. It would only serve to remind her of a vanished happiness. She\npacked a few clothes of her own and Sidney's in a little trunk, Hilma\nhelping her, and Annixter stowed the trunk under the carry-all's back\nseat. Mrs. Dyke turned the key in the door of the house and Annixter\nhelped her to her seat beside his wife. They drove through the sear,\nbrown hop vines. At the angle of the road Mrs. Dyke turned around and\nlooked back at the ruin of the hop ranch, the roof of the house just\nshowing above the trees. She never saw it again.\n\nAs soon as Annixter and Hilma were alone, after their return to Quien\nSabe--Mrs. Dyke and Sidney having been installed in the Trees' old\nhouse--Hilma threw her arms around her husband's neck.\n\n“Fine,” she exclaimed, “oh, it was fine of you, dear to think of them\nand to be so good to them. My husband is such a GOOD man. So unselfish.\nYou wouldn't have thought of being kind to Mrs. Dyke and Sidney a little\nwhile ago. You wouldn't have thought of them at all. But you did now,\nand it's just because you love me true, isn't it? Isn't it? And because\nit's made you a better man. I'm so proud and glad to think it's so. It\nis so, isn't it? Just because you love me true.”\n\n“You bet it is, Hilma,” he told her.\n\nAs Hilma and Annixter were sitting down to the supper which they found\nwaiting for them, Louisa Vacca came to the door of the dining-room\nto say that Harran Derrick had telephoned over from Los Muertos for\nAnnixter, and had left word for him to ring up Los Muertos as soon as he\ncame in.\n\n“He said it was important,” added Louisa Vacca.\n\n“Maybe they have news from Washington,” suggested Hilma.\n\nAnnixter would not wait to have supper, but telephoned to Los Muertos\nat once. Magnus answered the call. There was a special meeting of the\nExecutive Committee of the League summoned for the next day, he told\nAnnixter. It was for the purpose of considering the new grain tariff\nprepared by the Railroad Commissioners. Lyman had written that the\nschedule of this tariff had just been issued, that he had not been able\nto construct it precisely according to the wheat-growers' wishes,\nand that he, himself, would come down to Los Muertos and explain its\napparent discrepancies. Magnus said Lyman would be present at the\nsession.\n\nAnnixter, curious for details, forbore, nevertheless, to question. The\nconnection from Los Muertos to Quien Sabe was made through Bonneville,\nand in those troublesome times no one could be trusted. It could not\nbe known who would overhear conversations carried on over the lines.\nHe assured Magnus that he would be on hand. The time for the Committee\nmeeting had been set for seven o'clock in the evening, in order to\naccommodate Lyman, who wrote that he would be down on the evening train,\nbut would be compelled, by pressure of business, to return to the city\nearly the next morning.\n\nAt the time appointed, the men composing the Committee gathered about\nthe table in the dining-room of the Los Muertos ranch house. It was\nalmost a reproduction of the scene of the famous evening when Osterman\nhad proposed the plan of the Ranchers' Railroad Commission. Magnus\nDerrick sat at the head of the table, in his buttoned frock coat.\nWhiskey bottles and siphons of soda-water were within easy reach.\nPresley, who by now was considered the confidential friend of every\nmember of the Committee, lounged as before on the sofa, smoking\ncigarettes, the cat Nathalie on his knee. Besides Magnus and Annixter,\nOsterman was present, and old Broderson and Harran; Garnet from the\nRuby Rancho and Gethings of the San Pablo, who were also members of the\nExecutive Committee, were on hand, preoccupied, bearded men, smoking\nblack cigars, and, last of all, Dabney, the silent old man, of whom\nlittle was known but his name, and who had been made a member of the\nCommittee, nobody could tell why.\n\n“My son Lyman should be here, gentlemen, within at least ten minutes.\nI have sent my team to meet him at Bonneville,” explained Magnus, as he\ncalled the meeting to order. “The Secretary will call the roll.”\n\nOsterman called the roll, and, to fill in the time, read over the\nminutes of the previous meeting. The treasurer was making his report as\nto the funds at the disposal of the League when Lyman arrived.\n\nMagnus and Harran went forward to meet him, and the Committee rather\nawkwardly rose and remained standing while the three exchanged\ngreetings, the members, some of whom had never seen their commissioner,\neyeing him out of the corners of their eyes.\n\nLyman was dressed with his usual correctness. His cravat was of the\nlatest fashion, his clothes of careful design and unimpeachable fit. His\nshoes, of patent leather, reflected the lamplight, and he carried a\ndrab overcoat over his arm. Before being introduced to the Committee, he\nexcused himself a moment and ran to see his mother, who waited for him\nin the adjoining sitting-room. But in a few moments he returned, asking\npardon for the delay.\n\nHe was all affability; his protruding eyes, that gave such an unusual,\nforeign appearance to his very dark face, radiated geniality. He was\nevidently anxious to please, to produce a good impression upon the\ngrave, clumsy farmers before whom he stood. But at the same time,\nPresley, watching him from his place on the sofa, could imagine that he\nwas rather nervous. He was too nimble in his cordiality, and the little\ngestures he made in bringing his cuffs into view and in touching the\nends of his tight, black mustache with the ball of his thumb were\nrepeated with unnecessary frequency.\n\n“Mr. Broderson, my son, Lyman, my eldest son. Mr. Annixter, my son,\nLyman.”\n\nThe Governor introduced him to the ranchers, proud of Lyman's good\nlooks, his correct dress, his ease of manner. Lyman shook hands all\naround, keeping up a flow of small talk, finding a new phrase for each\nmember, complimenting Osterman, whom he already knew, upon his talent\nfor organisation, recalling a mutual acquaintance to the mind of old\nBroderson. At length, however, he sat down at the end of the table,\nopposite his brother. There was a silence.\n\nMagnus rose to recapitulate the reasons for the extra session of the\nCommittee, stating again that the Board of Railway Commissioners which\nthey--the ranchers--had succeeded in seating had at length issued the\nnew schedule of reduced rates, and that Mr. Derrick had been obliging\nenough to offer to come down to Los Muertos in person to acquaint the\nwheat-growers of the San Joaquin with the new rates for the carriage of\ntheir grain.\n\nBut Lyman very politely protested, addressing his father punctiliously\nas “Mr. Chairman,” and the other ranchers as “Gentlemen of the Executive\nCommittee of the League.” He had no wish, he said, to disarrange the\nregular proceedings of the Committee. Would it not be preferable to\ndefer the reading of his report till “new business” was called for?\nIn the meanwhile, let the Committee proceed with its usual work. He\nunderstood the necessarily delicate nature of this work, and would be\npleased to withdraw till the proper time arrived for him to speak.\n\n“Good deal of backing and filling about the reading of a column of\nfigures,” muttered Annixter to the man at his elbow.\n\nLyman “awaited the Committee's decision.” He sat down, touching the ends\nof his mustache.\n\n“Oh, play ball,” growled Annixter.\n\nGethings rose to say that as the meeting had been called solely for the\npurpose of hearing and considering the new grain tariff, he was of the\nopinion that routine business could be dispensed with and the schedule\nread at once. It was so ordered.\n\nLyman rose and made a long speech. Voluble as Osterman himself, he,\nnevertheless, had at his command a vast number of ready-made phrases,\nthe staples of a political speaker, the stock in trade of the commercial\nlawyer, which rolled off his tongue with the most persuasive fluency.\nBy degrees, in the course of his speech, he began to insinuate the idea\nthat the wheat-growers had never expected to settle their difficulties\nwith the Railroad by the work of a single commission; that they\nhad counted upon a long, continued campaign of many years, railway\ncommission succeeding railway commission, before the desired low rates\nshould be secured; that the present Board of Commissioners was only the\nbeginning and that too great results were not expected from them. All\nthis he contrived to mention casually, in the talk, as if it were a\nforegone conclusion, a matter understood by all.\n\nAs the speech continued, the eyes of the ranchers around the table were\nfixed with growing attention upon this well-dressed, city-bred young\nman, who spoke so fluently and who told them of their own intentions. A\nfeeling of perplexity began to spread, and the first taint of distrust\ninvaded their minds.\n\n“But the good work has been most auspiciously inaugurated,” continued\nLyman. “Reforms so sweeping as the one contemplated cannot be\naccomplished in a single night. Great things grow slowly, benefits to\nbe permanent must accrue gradually. Yet, in spite of all this, your\ncommissioners have done much. Already the phalanx of the enemy\nis pierced, already his armour is dinted. Pledged as were your\ncommissioners to an average ten per cent. reduction in rates for the\ncarriage of grain by the Pacific and Southwestern Railroad, we have\nrigidly adhered to the demands of our constituency, we have obeyed the\nPeople. The main problem has not yet been completely solved; that is\nfor later, when we shall have gathered sufficient strength to attack the\nenemy in his very stronghold; BUT AN AVERAGE TEN PER CENT. CUT HAS BEEN\nMADE ALL OVER THE STATE. We have made a great advance, have taken a\ngreat step forward, and if the work is carried ahead, upon the lines\nlaid down by the present commissioners and their constituents, there\nis every reason to believe that within a very few years equitable and\nstable rates for the shipment of grain from the San Joaquin Valley to\nStockton, Port Costa, and tidewater will be permanently imposed.”\n\n“Well, hold on,” exclaimed Annixter, out of order and ignoring the\nGovernor's reproof, “hasn't your commission reduced grain rates in the\nSan Joaquin?”\n\n“We have reduced grain rates by ten per cent. all over the State,”\n rejoined Lyman. “Here are copies of the new schedule.”\n\nHe drew them from his valise and passed them around the table.\n\n“You see,” he observed, “the rate between Mayfield and Oakland, for\ninstance, has been reduced by twenty-five cents a ton.”\n\n“Yes--but--but--” said old Broderson, “it is rather unusual, isn't it,\nfor wheat in that district to be sent to Oakland?” “Why, look here,”\n exclaimed Annixter, looking up from the schedule, “where is there any\nreduction in rates in the San Joaquin--from Bonneville and Guadalajara,\nfor instance? I don't see as you've made any reduction at all. Is this\nright? Did you give me the right schedule?”\n\n“Of course, ALL the points in the State could not be covered at once,”\n returned Lyman. “We never expected, you know, that we could cut rates in\nthe San Joaquin the very first move; that is for later. But you will see\nwe made very material reductions on shipments from the upper Sacramento\nValley; also the rate from Ione to Marysville has been reduced eighty\ncents a ton.”\n\n“Why, rot,” cried Annixter, “no one ever ships wheat that way.”\n\n“The Salinas rate,” continued Lyman, “has been lowered seventy-five\ncents; the St. Helena rate fifty cents, and please notice the very\ndrastic cut from Red Bluff, north, along the Oregon route, to the Oregon\nState Line.”\n\n“Where not a carload of wheat is shipped in a year,” commented Gethings\nof the San Pablo.\n\n“Oh, you will find yourself mistaken there, Mr. Gethings,” returned\nLyman courteously. “And for the matter of that, a low rate would\nstimulate wheat-production in that district.”\n\nThe order of the meeting was broken up, neglected; Magnus did not even\npretend to preside. In the growing excitement over the inexplicable\nschedule, routine was not thought of. Every one spoke at will.\n\n“Why, Lyman,” demanded Magnus, looking across the table to his son, “is\nthis schedule correct? You have not cut rates in the San Joaquin at all.\nWe--these gentlemen here and myself, we are no better off than we were\nbefore we secured your election as commissioner.”\n\n“We were pledged to make an average ten per cent. cut, sir----” “It IS\nan average ten per cent. cut,” cried Osterman. “Oh, yes, that's plain.\nIt's an average ten per cent. cut all right, but you've made it by\ncutting grain rates between points where practically no grain is\nshipped. We, the wheat-growers in the San Joaquin, where all the wheat\nis grown, are right where we were before. The Railroad won't lose a\nnickel. By Jingo, boys,” he glanced around the table, “I'd like to know\nwhat this means.”\n\n“The Railroad, if you come to that,” returned Lyman, “has already lodged\na protest against the new rate.”\n\nAnnixter uttered a derisive shout.\n\n“A protest! That's good, that is. When the P. and S. W. objects to rates\nit don't 'protest,' m' son. The first you hear from Mr. Shelgrim is\nan injunction from the courts preventing the order for new rates from\ntaking effect. By the Lord,” he cried angrily, leaping to his feet, “I\nwould like to know what all this means, too. Why didn't you reduce our\ngrain rates? What did we elect you for?”\n\n“Yes, what did we elect you for?” demanded Osterman and Gethings, also\ngetting to their feet.\n\n“Order, order, gentlemen,” cried Magnus, remembering the duties of his\noffice and rapping his knuckles on the table. “This meeting has been\nallowed to degenerate too far already.”\n\n“You elected us,” declared Lyman doggedly, “to make an average ten\nper cent. cut on grain rates. We have done it. Only because you don't\nbenefit at once, you object. It makes a difference whose ox is gored, it\nseems.”\n\n“Lyman!”\n\nIt was Magnus who spoke. He had drawn himself to his full six feet. His\neyes were flashing direct into his son's. His voice rang with severity.\n\n“Lyman, what does this mean?”\n\nThe other spread out his hands.\n\n“As you see, sir. We have done our best. I warned you not to expect too\nmuch. I told you that this question of transportation was difficult.\nYou would not wish to put rates so low that the action would amount to\nconfiscation of property.”\n\n“Why did you not lower rates in the valley of the San Joaquin?”\n\n“That was not a PROMINENT issue in the affair,” responded Lyman,\ncarefully emphasising his words. “I understand, of course, it was to\nbe approached IN TIME. The main point was AN AVERAGE TEN PER CENT.\nREDUCTION. Rates WILL be lowered in the San Joaquin. The ranchers around\nBonneville will be able to ship to Port Costa at equitable rates, but so\nradical a measure as that cannot be put through in a turn of the hand.\nWe must study----”\n\n“You KNEW the San Joaquin rate was an issue,” shouted Annixter, shaking\nhis finger across the table. “What do we men who backed you care about\nrates up in Del Norte and Siskiyou Counties? Not a whoop in hell. It was\nthe San Joaquin rate we were fighting for, and we elected you to reduce\nthat. You didn't do it and you don't intend to, and, by the Lord Harry,\nI want to know why.”\n\n“You'll know, sir--” began Lyman.\n\n“Well, I'll tell you why,” vociferated Osterman. “I'll tell you why.\nIt's because we have been sold out. It's because the P. and S. W. have\nhad their spoon in this boiling. It's because our commissioners have\nbetrayed us. It's because we're a set of damn fool farmers and have been\ncinched again.”\n\nLyman paled under his dark skin at the direct attack. He evidently had\nnot expected this so soon. For the fraction of one instant he lost his\npoise. He strove to speak, but caught his breath, stammering.\n\n“What have you to say, then?” cried Harran, who, until now, had not\nspoken.\n\n“I have this to say,” answered Lyman, making head as best he might,\n“that this is no proper spirit in which to discuss business. The\nCommission has fulfilled its obligations. It has adjusted rates to\nthe best of its ability. We have been at work for two months on the\npreparation of this schedule----”\n\n“That's a lie,” shouted Annixter, his face scarlet; “that's a lie. That\nschedule was drawn in the offices of the Pacific and Southwestern and\nyou know it. It's a scheme of rates made for the Railroad and by the\nRailroad and you were bought over to put your name to it.”\n\nThere was a concerted outburst at the words. All the men in the room\nwere on their feet, gesticulating and vociferating.\n\n“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” cried Magnus, “are we schoolboys, are we\nruffians of the street?”\n\n“We're a set of fool farmers and we've been betrayed,” cried Osterman.\n\n“Well, what have you to say? What have you to say?” persisted Harran,\nleaning across the table toward his brother. “For God's sake, Lyman,\nyou've got SOME explanation.”\n\n“You've misunderstood,” protested Lyman, white and trembling. “You've\nmisunderstood. You've expected too much. Next year,--next year,--soon\nnow, the Commission will take up the--the Commission will consider the\nSan Joaquin rate. We've done our best, that is all.”\n\n“Have you, sir?” demanded Magnus.\n\nThe Governor's head was in a whirl; a sensation, almost of faintness,\nhad seized upon him. Was it possible? Was it possible?\n\n“Have you done your best?” For a second he compelled Lyman's eye.\nThe glances of father and son met, and, in spite of his best efforts,\nLyman's eyes wavered. He began to protest once more, explaining the\nmatter over again from the beginning. But Magnus did not listen. In\nthat brief lapse of time he was convinced that the terrible thing had\nhappened, that the unbelievable had come to pass. It was in the air.\nBetween father and son, in some subtle fashion, the truth that was a\nlie stood suddenly revealed. But even then Magnus would not receive it.\nLyman do this! His son, his eldest son, descend to this! Once more and\nfor the last time he turned to him and in his voice there was that ring\nthat compelled silence.\n\n“Lyman,” he said, “I adjure you--I--I demand of you as you are my son\nand an honourable man, explain yourself. What is there behind all this?\nIt is no longer as Chairman of the Committee I speak to you, you a\nmember of the Railroad Commission. It is your father who speaks, and I\naddress you as my son. Do you understand the gravity of this crisis;\ndo you realise the responsibility of your position; do you not see the\nimportance of this moment? Explain yourself.”\n\n“There is nothing to explain.”\n\n“You have not reduced rates in the San Joaquin? You have not reduced\nrates between Bonneville and tidewater?”\n\n“I repeat, sir, what I said before. An average ten per cent. cut----”\n\n“Lyman, answer me, yes or no. Have you reduced the Bonneville rate?”\n\n“It could not be done so soon. Give us time. We----”\n\n“Yes or no! By God, sir, do you dare equivocate with me? Yes or no; have\nyou reduced the Bonneville rate?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“And answer ME,” shouted Harran, leaning far across the table, “answer\nME. Were you paid by the Railroad to leave the San Joaquin rate\nuntouched?”\n\nLyman, whiter than ever, turned furious upon his brother.\n\n“Don't you dare put that question to me again.”\n\n“No, I won't,” cried Harran, “because I'll TELL you to your villain's\nface that you WERE paid to do it.”\n\nOn the instant the clamour burst forth afresh. Still on their feet, the\nranchers had, little by little, worked around the table, Magnus alone\nkeeping his place. The others were in a group before Lyman, crowding\nhim, as it were, to the wall, shouting into his face with menacing\ngestures. The truth that was a lie, the certainty of a trust betrayed, a\npledge ruthlessly broken, was plain to every one of them.\n\n“By the Lord! men have been shot for less than this,” cried Osterman.\n“You've sold us out, you, and if you ever bring that dago face of yours\non a level with mine again, I'll slap it.”\n\n“Keep your hands off,” exclaimed Lyman quickly, the aggressiveness of\nthe cornered rat flaming up within him. “No violence. Don't you go too\nfar.”\n\n“How much were you paid? How much were you paid?” vociferated Harran.\n\n“Yes, yes, what was your price?” cried the others. They were beside\nthemselves with anger; their words came harsh from between their set\nteeth; their gestures were made with their fists clenched.\n\n“You know the Commission acted in good faith,” retorted Lyman. “You know\nthat all was fair and above board.”\n\n“Liar,” shouted Annixter; “liar, bribe-eater. You were bought and paid\nfor,” and with the words his arm seemed almost of itself to leap out\nfrom his shoulder. Lyman received the blow squarely in the face and the\nforce of it sent him staggering backwards toward the wall. He tripped\nover his valise and fell half way, his back supported against the closed\ndoor of the room. Magnus sprang forward. His son had been struck, and\nthe instincts of a father rose up in instant protest; rose for a moment,\nthen forever died away in his heart. He checked the words that flashed\nto his mind. He lowered his upraised arm. No, he had but one son.\nThe poor, staggering creature with the fine clothes, white face, and\nblood-streaked lips was no longer his. A blow could not dishonour him\nmore than he had dishonoured himself.\n\nBut Gethings, the older man, intervened, pulling Annixter back, crying:\n\n“Stop, this won't do. Not before his father.”\n\n“I am no father to this man, gentlemen,” exclaimed Magnus. “From now on,\nI have but one son. You, sir,” he turned to Lyman, “you, sir, leave my\nhouse.”\n\nLyman, his handkerchief to his lips, his smart cravat in disarray,\ncaught up his hat and coat. He was shaking with fury, his protruding\neyes were blood-shot. He swung open the door.\n\n“Ruffians,” he shouted from the threshold, “ruffians, bullies. Do your\nown dirty business yourselves after this. I'm done with you. How is it,\nall of a sudden you talk about honour? How is it that all at once you're\nso clean and straight? You weren't so particular at Sacramento just\nbefore the nominations. How was the Board elected? I'm a bribe-eater,\nam I? Is it any worse than GIVING a bribe? Ask Magnus Derrick what he\nthinks about that. Ask him how much he paid the Democratic bosses at\nSacramento to swing the convention.”\n\nHe went out, slamming the door.\n\nPresley followed. The whole affair made him sick at heart, filled him\nwith infinite disgust, infinite weariness. He wished to get away from it\nall. He left the dining-room and the excited, clamouring men behind him\nand stepped out on the porch of the ranch house, closing the door behind\nhim. Lyman was nowhere in sight. Presley was alone. It was late, and\nafter the lamp-heated air of the dining-room, the coolness of the night\nwas delicious, and its vast silence, after the noise and fury of the\ncommittee meeting, descended from the stars like a benediction. Presley\nstepped to the edge of the porch, looking off to southward.\n\nAnd there before him, mile after mile, illimitable, covering the earth\nfrom horizon to horizon, lay the Wheat. The growth, now many days old,\nwas already high from the ground. There it lay, a vast, silent ocean,\nshimmering a pallid green under the moon and under the stars; a mighty\nforce, the strength of nations, the life of the world. There in the\nnight, under the dome of the sky, it was growing steadily. To Presley's\nmind, the scene in the room he had just left dwindled to paltry\ninsignificance before this sight. Ah, yes, the Wheat--it was over this\nthat the Railroad, the ranchers, the traitor false to his trust, all\nthe members of an obscure conspiracy, were wrangling. As if human\nagency could affect this colossal power! What were these heated, tiny\nsquabbles, this feverish, small bustle of mankind, this minute swarming\nof the human insect, to the great, majestic, silent ocean of the Wheat\nitself! Indifferent, gigantic, resistless, it moved in its appointed\ngrooves. Men, Liliputians, gnats in the sunshine, buzzed impudently in\ntheir tiny battles, were born, lived through their little day, died, and\nwere forgotten; while the Wheat, wrapped in Nirvanic calm, grew steadily\nunder the night, alone with the stars and with God.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nJack-rabbits were a pest that year and Presley occasionally found\namusement in hunting them with Harran's half-dozen greyhounds, following\nthe chase on horseback. One day, between two and three months after\nLyman s visit to Los Muertos, as he was returning toward the ranch house\nfrom a distant and lonely quarter of Los Muertos, he came unexpectedly\nupon a strange sight.\n\nSome twenty men, Annixter's and Osterman's tenants, and small ranchers\nfrom east of Guadalajara--all members of the League--were going through\nthe manual of arms under Harran Derrick's supervision. They were all\nequipped with new Winchester rifles. Harran carried one of these himself\nand with it he illustrated the various commands he gave. As soon as one\nof the men under his supervision became more than usually proficient, he\nwas told off to instruct a file of the more backward. After the manual\nof arms, Harran gave the command to take distance as skirmishers, and\nwhen the line had opened out so that some half-dozen feet intervened\nbetween each man, an advance was made across the field, the men stooping\nlow and snapping the hammers of their rifles at an imaginary enemy.\n\nThe League had its agents in San Francisco, who watched the movements\nof the Railroad as closely as was possible, and some time before this,\nAnnixter had received word that the Marshal and his deputies were coming\ndown to Bonneville to put the dummy buyers of his ranch in possession.\nThe report proved to be but the first of many false alarms, but it\nhad stimulated the League to unusual activity, and some three or four\nhundred men were furnished with arms and from time to time were drilled\nin secret.\n\nAmong themselves, the ranchers said that if the Railroad managers did\nnot believe they were terribly in earnest in the stand they had taken,\nthey were making a fatal mistake.\n\nHarran reasserted this statement to Presley on the way home to the\nranch house that same day. Harran had caught up with him by the time he\nreached the Lower Road, and the two jogged homeward through the miles of\nstanding wheat.\n\n“They may jump the ranch, Pres,” he said, “if they try hard enough, but\nthey will never do it while I am alive. By the way,” he added, “you know\nwe served notices yesterday upon S. Behrman and Cy. Ruggles to quit the\ncountry. Of course, they won't do it, but they won't be able to say they\ndidn't have warning.”\n\nAbout an hour later, the two reached the ranch house, but as Harran rode\nup the driveway, he uttered an exclamation.\n\n“Hello,” he said, “something is up. That's Genslinger's buckboard.”\n\nIn fact, the editor's team was tied underneath the shade of a giant\neucalyptus tree near by. Harran, uneasy under this unexpected visit of\nthe enemy's friend, dismounted without stabling his horse, and went at\nonce to the dining-room, where visitors were invariably received. But\nthe dining-room was empty, and his mother told him that Magnus and\nthe editor were in the “office.” Magnus had said they were not to be\ndisturbed.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, the editor had driven up to the porch and had\nasked Mrs. Derrick, whom he found reading a book of poems on the porch,\nif he could see Magnus. At the time, the Governor had gone with Phelps\nto inspect the condition of the young wheat on Hooven's holding, but\nwithin half an hour he returned, and Genslinger had asked him for a “few\nmoments' talk in private.”\n\nThe two went into the “office,” Magnus locking the door behind him.\n“Very complete you are here, Governor,” observed the editor in his\nalert, jerky manner, his black, bead-like eyes twinkling around the room\nfrom behind his glasses. “Telephone, safe, ticker, account-books--well,\nthat's progress, isn't it? Only way to manage a big ranch these days.\nBut the day of the big ranch is over. As the land appreciates in value,\nthe temptation to sell off small holdings will be too strong. And then\nthe small holding can be cultivated to better advantage. I shall have an\neditorial on that some day.”\n\n“The cost of maintaining a number of small holdings,” said Magnus,\nindifferently, “is, of course, greater than if they were all under one\nmanagement.”\n\n“That may be, that may be,” rejoined the other.\n\nThere was a long pause. Genslinger leaned back in his chair and rubbed\na knee. Magnus, standing erect in front of the safe, waited for him to\nspeak.\n\n“This is an unfortunate business, Governor,” began the editor, “this\nmisunderstanding between the ranchers and the Railroad. I wish it could\nbe adjusted. HERE are two industries that MUST be in harmony with one\nanother, or we all go to pot.”\n\n“I should prefer not to be interviewed on the subject, Mr. Genslinger,”\n said Magnus.\n\n“Oh, no, oh, no. Lord love you, Governor, I don't want to interview you.\nWe all know how you stand.”\n\nAgain there was a long silence. Magnus wondered what this little man,\nusually so garrulous, could want of him. At length, Genslinger began\nagain. He did not look at Magnus, except at long intervals.\n\n“About the present Railroad Commission,” he remarked. “That was an\ninteresting campaign you conducted in Sacramento and San Francisco.”\n\nMagnus held his peace, his hands shut tight. Did Genslinger know of\nLyman's disgrace? Was it for this he had come? Would the story of it be\nthe leading article in to-morrow's Mercury?\n\n“An interesting campaign,” repeated Genslinger, slowly; “a very\ninteresting campaign. I watched it with every degree of interest. I saw\nits every phase, Mr. Derrick.”\n\n“The campaign was not without its interest,” admitted Magnus.\n\n“Yes,” said Genslinger, still more deliberately, “and some phases of it\nwere--more interesting than others, as, for instance, let us say the\nway in which you--personally--secured the votes of certain chairmen of\ndelegations--NEED I particularise further? Yes, those men--the way\nyou got their votes. Now, THAT I should say, Mr. Derrick, was the most\ninteresting move in the whole game--to you. Hm, curious,” he murmured,\nmusingly. “Let's see. You deposited two one-thousand dollar bills and\nfour five-hundred dollar bills in a box--three hundred and eight was\nthe number--in a box in the Safety Deposit Vaults in San Francisco, and\nthen--let's see, you gave a key to this box to each of the gentlemen\nin question, and after the election the box was empty. Now, I call that\ninteresting--curious, because it's a new, safe, and highly ingenious\nmethod of bribery. How did you happen to think of it, Governor?”\n\n“Do you know what you are doing, sir?” Magnus burst forth. “Do you know\nwhat you are insinuating, here, in my own house?”\n\n“Why, Governor,” returned the editor, blandly, “I'm not INSINUATING\nanything. I'm talking about what I KNOW.”\n\n“It's a lie.”\n\nGenslinger rubbed his chin reflectively.\n\n“Well,” he answered, “you can have a chance to prove it before the Grand\nJury, if you want to.”\n\n“My character is known all over the State,” blustered Magnus. “My\npolitics are pure politics. My----”\n\n“No one needs a better reputation for pure politics than the man who\nsets out to be a briber,” interrupted Genslinger, “and I might as well\ntell you, Governor, that you can't shout me down. I can put my hand\non the two chairmen you bought before it's dark to-day. I've had their\ndepositions in my safe for the last six weeks. We could make the arrests\nto-morrow, if we wanted. Governor, you sure did a risky thing when you\nwent into that Sacramento fight, an awful risky thing. Some men can\nafford to have bribery charges preferred against them, and it don't hurt\none little bit, but YOU--Lord, it would BUST you, Governor, bust you\ndead. I know all about the whole shananigan business from A to Z, and\nif you don't believe it--here,” he drew a long strip of paper from his\npocket, “here's a galley proof of the story.”\n\nMagnus took it in his hands. There, under his eyes, scare-headed,\ndouble-leaded, the more important clauses printed in bold type, was the\ndetailed account of the “deal” Magnus had made with the two delegates.\nIt was pitiless, remorseless, bald. Every statement was substantiated,\nevery statistic verified with Genslinger's meticulous love for\nexactness. Besides all that, it had the ring of truth. It was exposure,\nruin, absolute annihilation.\n\n“That's about correct, isn't it?” commented Genslinger, as Derrick\nfinished reading. Magnus did not reply. “I think it is correct enough,”\n the editor continued. “But I thought it would only be fair to you to let\nyou see it before it was published.”\n\nThe one thought uppermost in Derrick's mind, his one impulse of the\nmoment was, at whatever cost, to preserve his dignity, not to allow\nthis man to exult in the sight of one quiver of weakness, one trace of\ndefeat, one suggestion of humiliation. By an effort that put all his\niron rigidity to the test, he forced himself to look straight into\nGenslinger's eyes.\n\n“I congratulate you,” he observed, handing back the proof, “upon your\njournalistic enterprise. Your paper will sell to-morrow.” “Oh, I\ndon't know as I want to publish this story,” remarked the editor,\nindifferently, putting away the galley. “I'm just like that. The fun\nfor me is running a good story to earth, but once I've got it, I lose\ninterest. And, then, I wouldn't like to see you--holding the position\nyou do, President of the League and a leading man of the county--I\nwouldn't like to see a story like this smash you over. It's worth\nmore to you to keep it out of print than for me to put it in. I've got\nnothing much to gain but a few extra editions, but you--Lord, you would\nlose everything. Your committee was in the deal right enough. But your\nLeague, all the San Joaquin Valley, everybody in the State believes the\ncommissioners were fairly elected.”\n\n“Your story,” suddenly exclaimed Magnus, struck with an idea, “will\nbe thoroughly discredited just so soon as the new grain tariff is\npublished. I have means of knowing that the San Joaquin rate--the issue\nupon which the board was elected--is not to be touched. Is it likely the\nranchers would secure the election of a board that plays them false?”\n\n“Oh, we know all about that,” answered Genslinger, smiling. “You thought\nyou were electing Lyman easily. You thought you had got the Railroad to\nwalk right into your trap. You didn't understand how you could pull off\nyour deal so easily. Why, Governor, LYMAN WAS PLEDGED TO THE RAILROAD\nTWO YEARS AGO. He was THE ONE PARTICULAR man the corporation wanted for\ncommissioner. And your people elected him--saved the Railroad all the\ntrouble of campaigning for him. And you can't make any counter charge\nof bribery there. No, sir, the corporation don't use such amateurish\nmethods as that. Confidentially and between us two, all that the\nRailroad has done for Lyman, in order to attach him to their interests,\nis to promise to back him politically in the next campaign for Governor.\nIt's too bad,” he continued, dropping his voice, and changing his\nposition. “It really is too bad to see good men trying to bunt a stone\nwall over with their bare heads. You couldn't have won at any stage of\nthe game. I wish I could have talked to you and your friends before you\nwent into that Sacramento fight. I could have told you then how little\nchance you had. When will you people realise that you can't buck against\nthe Railroad? Why, Magnus, it's like me going out in a paper boat and\nshooting peas at a battleship.”\n\n“Is that all you wished to see me about, Mr. Genslinger?” remarked\nMagnus, bestirring himself. “I am rather occupied to-day.” “Well,”\n returned the other, “you know what the publication of this article would\nmean for you.” He paused again, took off his glasses, breathed on them,\npolished the lenses with his handkerchief and readjusted them on his\nnose. “I've been thinking, Governor,” he began again, with renewed\nalertness, and quite irrelevantly, “of enlarging the scope of the\n'Mercury.' You see, I'm midway between the two big centres of the State,\nSan Francisco and Los Angeles, and I want to extend the 'Mercury's'\nsphere of influence as far up and down the valley as I can. I want to\nillustrate the paper. You see, if I had a photo-engraving plant of\nmy own, I could do a good deal of outside jobbing as well, and the\ninvestment would pay ten per cent. But it takes money to make money.\nI wouldn't want to put in any dinky, one-horse affair. I want a good\nplant. I've been figuring out the business. Besides the plant, there\nwould be the expense of a high grade paper. Can't print half-tones on\nanything but coated paper, and that COSTS. Well, what with this and with\nthat and running expenses till the thing began to pay, it would cost\nme about ten thousand dollars, and I was wondering if, perhaps, you\ncouldn't see your way clear to accommodating me.”\n\n“Ten thousand?”\n\n“Yes. Say five thousand down, and the balance within sixty days.”\n\nMagnus, for the moment blind to what Genslinger had in mind, turned on\nhim in astonishment.\n\n“Why, man, what security could you give me for such an amount?”\n\n“Well, to tell the truth,” answered the editor, “I hadn't thought much\nabout securities. In fact, I believed you would see how greatly it was\nto your advantage to talk business with me. You see, I'm not going to\nprint this article about you, Governor, and I'm not going to let it get\nout so as any one else can print it, and it seems to me that one good\nturn deserves another. You understand?”\n\nMagnus understood. An overwhelming desire suddenly took possession of\nhim to grip this blackmailer by the throat, to strangle him where he\nstood; or, if not, at least to turn upon him with that old-time terrible\nanger, before which whole conventions had once cowered. But in the same\nmoment the Governor realised this was not to be. Only its righteousness\nhad made his wrath terrible; only the justice of his anger had made him\nfeared. Now the foundation was gone from under his feet; he had knocked\nit away himself. Three times feeble was he whose quarrel was unjust.\nBefore this country editor, this paid speaker of the Railroad, he stood,\nconvicted. The man had him at his mercy. The detected briber could not\nresent an insult. Genslinger rose, smoothing his hat.\n\n“Well,” he said, “of course, you want time to think it over, and you\ncan't raise money like that on short notice. I'll wait till Friday noon\nof this week. We begin to set Saturday's paper at about four, Friday\nafternoon, and the forms are locked about two in the morning. I hope,”\n he added, turning back at the door of the room, “that you won't find\nanything disagreeable in your Saturday morning 'Mercury,' Mr. Derrick.”\n\nHe went out, closing the door behind him, and in a moment, Magnus heard\nthe wheels of his buckboard grating on the driveway.\n\nThe following morning brought a letter to Magnus from Gethings, of the\nSan Pueblo ranch, which was situated very close to Visalia. The letter\nwas to the effect that all around Visalia, upon the ranches affected by\nthe regrade of the Railroad, men were arming and drilling, and that the\nstrength of the League in that quarter was undoubted. “But to refer,”\n continued the letter, “to a most painful recollection. You will, no\ndoubt, remember that, at the close of our last committee meeting,\nspecific charges were made as to fraud in the nomination and election\nof one of our commissioners, emanating, most unfortunately, from the\ncommissioner himself. These charges, my dear Mr. Derrick, were directed\nat yourself. How the secrets of the committee have been noised about,\nI cannot understand. You may be, of course, assured of my own\nunquestioning confidence and loyalty. However, I regret exceedingly\nto state not only that the rumour of the charges referred to above is\nspreading in this district, but that also they are made use of by the\nenemies of the League. It is to be deplored that some of the Leaguers\nthemselves--you know, we number in our ranks many small farmers,\nignorant Portuguese and foreigners--have listened to these stories\nand have permitted a feeling of uneasiness to develop among them. Even\nthough it were admitted that fraudulent means had been employed in the\nelections, which, of course, I personally do not admit, I do not think\nit would make very much difference in the confidence which the vast\nmajority of the Leaguers repose in their chiefs. Yet we have so insisted\nupon the probity of our position as opposed to Railroad chicanery,\nthat I believe it advisable to quell this distant suspicion at once; to\npublish a denial of these rumoured charges would only be to give them\ntoo much importance. However, can you not write me a letter, stating\nexactly how the campaign was conducted, and the commission nominated and\nelected? I could show this to some of the more disaffected, and it would\nserve to allay all suspicion on the instant. I think it would be well\nto write as though the initiative came, not from me, but from yourself,\nignoring this present letter. I offer this only as a suggestion, and\nwill confidently endorse any decision you may arrive at.”\n\nThe letter closed with renewed protestations of confidence.\n\nMagnus was alone when he read this. He put it carefully away in the\nfiling cabinet in his office, and wiped the sweat from his forehead and\nface. He stood for one moment, his hands rigid at his sides, his fists\nclinched.\n\n“This is piling up,” he muttered, looking blankly at the opposite wall.\n“My God, this is piling up. What am I to do?”\n\nAh, the bitterness of unavailing regret, the anguish of compromise with\nconscience, the remorse of a bad deed done in a moment of excitement.\nAh, the humiliation of detection, the degradation of being caught,\ncaught like a schoolboy pilfering his fellows' desks, and, worse\nthan all, worse than all, the consciousness of lost self-respect, the\nknowledge of a prestige vanishing, a dignity impaired, knowledge that\nthe grip which held a multitude in check was trembling, that control\nwas wavering, that command was being weakened. Then the little tricks\nto deceive the crowd, the little subterfuges, the little pretences that\nkept up appearances, the lies, the bluster, the pose, the strut, the\ngasconade, where once was iron authority; the turning of the head so\nas not to see that which could not be prevented; the suspicion of\nsuspicion, the haunting fear of the Man on the Street, the uneasiness\nof the direct glance, the questioning as to motives--why had this been\nsaid, what was meant by that word, that gesture, that glance?\n\nWednesday passed, and Thursday. Magnus kept to himself, seeing no\nvisitors, avoiding even his family. How to break through the mesh of the\nnet, how to regain the old position, how to prevent discovery? If there\nwere only some way, some vast, superhuman effort by which he could rise\nin his old strength once more, crushing Lyman with one hand, Genslinger\nwith the other, and for one more moment, the last, to stand supreme\nagain, indomitable, the leader; then go to his death, triumphant at the\nend, his memory untarnished, his fame undimmed. But the plague-spot\nwas in himself, knitted forever into the fabric of his being. Though\nGenslinger should be silenced, though Lyman should be crushed, though\neven the League should overcome the Railroad, though he should be the\nacknowledged leader of a resplendent victory, yet the plague-spot\nwould remain. There was no success for him now. However conspicuous\nthe outward achievement, he, he himself, Magnus Derrick, had failed,\nmiserably and irredeemably.\n\nPetty, material complications intruded, sordid considerations. Even if\nGenslinger was to be paid, where was the money to come from? His legal\nbattles with the Railroad, extending now over a period of many years,\nhad cost him dear; his plan of sowing all of Los Muertos to wheat,\ndischarging the tenants, had proved expensive, the campaign resulting\nin Lyman's election had drawn heavily upon his account. All along he\nhad been relying upon a “bonanza crop” to reimburse him. It was not\nbelievable that the Railroad would “jump” Los Muertos, but if this\nshould happen, he would be left without resources. Ten thousand dollars!\nCould he raise the amount? Possibly. But to pay it out to a blackmailer!\nTo be held up thus in road-agent fashion, without a single means of\nredress! Would it not cripple him financially? Genslinger could do\nhis worst. He, Magnus, would brave it out. Was not his character above\nsuspicion?\n\nWas it? This letter of Gethings's. Already the murmur of uneasiness\nmade itself heard. Was this not the thin edge of the wedge? How the\npublication of Genslinger's story would drive it home! How the spark of\nsuspicion would flare into the blaze of open accusation! There would be\ninvestigations. Investigation! There was terror in the word. He could\nnot stand investigation. Magnus groaned aloud, covering his head with\nhis clasped hands. Briber, corrupter of government, ballot-box stuffer,\ndescending to the level of back-room politicians, of bar-room heelers,\nhe, Magnus Derrick, statesman of the old school, Roman in his iron\nintegrity, abandoning a career rather than enter the “new politics,”\n had, in one moment of weakness, hazarding all, even honour, on a single\nstake, taking great chances to achieve great results, swept away the\nwork of a lifetime.\n\nGambler that he was, he had at last chanced his highest stake, his\npersonal honour, in the greatest game of his life, and had lost.\n\nIt was Presley's morbidly keen observation that first noticed the\nevidence of a new trouble in the Governor's face and manner. Presley was\nsure that Lyman's defection had not so upset him. The morning after the\ncommittee meeting, Magnus had called Harran and Annie Derrick into the\noffice, and, after telling his wife of Lyman's betrayal, had forbidden\neither of them to mention his name again. His attitude towards his\nprodigal son was that of stern, unrelenting resentment. But now, Presley\ncould not fail to detect traces of a more deep-seated travail. Something\nwas in the wind, the times were troublous. What next was about to\nhappen? What fresh calamity impended?\n\nOne morning, toward the very end of the week, Presley woke early in his\nsmall, white-painted iron bed. He hastened to get up and dress. There\nwas much to be done that day. Until late the night before, he had\nbeen at work on a collection of some of his verses, gathered from the\nmagazines in which they had first appeared. Presley had received a\nliberal offer for the publication of these verses in book form. “The\nToilers” was to be included in this book, and, indeed, was to give it\nits name--“The Toilers and Other Poems.” Thus it was that, until the\nprevious midnight, he had been preparing the collection for publication,\nrevising, annotating, arranging. The book was to be sent off that\nmorning.\n\nBut also Presley had received a typewritten note from Annixter, inviting\nhim to Quien Sabe that same day. Annixter explained that it was Hilma's\nbirthday, and that he had planned a picnic on the high ground of his\nranch, at the headwaters of Broderson Creek. They were to go in the\ncarry-all, Hilma, Presley, Mrs. Dyke, Sidney, and himself, and were to\nmake a day of it. They would leave Quien Sabe at ten in the morning.\nPresley had at once resolved to go. He was immensely fond of\nAnnixter--more so than ever since his marriage with Hilma and the\nastonishing transformation of his character. Hilma, as well, was\ndelightful as Mrs. Annixter; and Mrs. Dyke and the little tad had always\nbeen his friends. He would have a good time.\n\nBut nobody was to go into Bonneville that morning with the mail, and if\nhe wished to send his manuscript, he would have to take it in himself.\nHe had resolved to do this, getting an early start, and going on\nhorseback to Quien Sabe, by way of Bonneville.\n\nIt was barely six o'clock when Presley sat down to his coffee and eggs\nin the dining-room of Los Muertos. The day promised to be hot, and\nfor the first time, Presley had put on a new khaki riding suit, very\nEnglish-looking, though in place of the regulation top-boots, he wore\nhis laced knee-boots, with a great spur on the left heel. Harran joined\nhim at breakfast, in his working clothes of blue canvas. He was bound\nfor the irrigating ditch to see how the work was getting on there.\n\n“How is the wheat looking?” asked Presley.\n\n“Bully,” answered the other, stirring his coffee. “The Governor has had\nhis usual luck. Practically, every acre of the ranch was sown to\nwheat, and everywhere the stand is good. I was over on Two, day before\nyesterday, and if nothing happens, I believe it will go thirty sacks\nto the acre there. Cutter reports that there are spots on Four where we\nwill get forty-two or three. Hooven, too, brought up some wonderful fine\nears for me to look at. The grains were just beginning to show. Some of\nthe ears carried twenty grains. That means nearly forty bushels of wheat\nto every acre. I call it a bonanza year.”\n\n“Have you got any mail?” said Presley, rising. “I'm going into town.”\n\nHarran shook his head, and took himself away, and Presley went down to\nthe stable-corral to get his pony.\n\nAs he rode out of the stable-yard and passed by the ranch house, on\nthe driveway, he was surprised to see Magnus on the lowest step of the\nporch.\n\n“Good morning, Governor,” called Presley. “Aren't you up pretty early?”\n\n“Good morning, Pres, my boy.” The Governor came forward and, putting his\nhand on the pony's withers, walked along by his side.\n\n“Going to town, Pres?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, sir. Can I do anything for you, Governor?”\n\nMagnus drew a sealed envelope from his pocket.\n\n“I wish you would drop in at the office of the Mercury for me,” he said,\n“and see Mr. Genslinger personally, and give him this envelope. It is a\npackage of papers, but they involve a considerable sum of money, and\nyou must be careful of them. A few years ago, when our enmity was not so\nstrong, Mr. Genslinger and I had some business dealings with each\nother. I thought it as well just now, considering that we are so openly\nopposed, to terminate the whole affair, and break off relations. We came\nto a settlement a few days ago. These are the final papers. They must be\ngiven to him in person, Presley. You understand.”\n\nPresley cantered on, turning into the county road and holding northward\nby the mammoth watering tank and Broderson's popular windbreak. As he\npassed Caraher's, he saw the saloon-keeper in the doorway of his place,\nand waved him a salutation which the other returned.\n\nBy degrees, Presley had come to consider Caraher in a more favourable\nlight. He found, to his immense astonishment, that Caraher knew\nsomething of Mill and Bakounin, not, however, from their books, but\nfrom extracts and quotations from their writings, reprinted in the\nanarchistic journals to which he subscribed. More than once, the two had\nheld long conversations, and from Caraher's own lips, Presley heard\nthe terrible story of the death of his wife, who had been accidentally\nkilled by Pinkertons during a “demonstration” of strikers. It invested\nthe saloon-keeper, in Presley's imagination, with all the dignity of the\ntragedy. He could not blame Caraher for being a “red.” He even wondered\nhow it was the saloon-keeper had not put his theories into practice, and\nadjusted his ancient wrong with his “six inches of plugged gas-pipe.”\n Presley began to conceive of the man as a “character.”\n\n“You wait, Mr. Presley,” the saloon-keeper had once said, when Presley\nhad protested against his radical ideas. “You don't know the Railroad\nyet. Watch it and its doings long enough, and you'll come over to my way\nof thinking, too.”\n\nIt was about half-past seven when Presley reached Bonneville. The\nbusiness part of the town was as yet hardly astir; he despatched his\nmanuscript, and then hurried to the office of the “Mercury.” Genslinger,\nas he feared, had not yet put in appearance, but the janitor of the\nbuilding gave Presley the address of the editor's residence, and it was\nthere he found him in the act of sitting down to breakfast. Presley was\nhardly courteous to the little man, and abruptly refused his offer of a\ndrink. He delivered Magnus's envelope to him and departed.\n\nIt had occurred to him that it would not do to present himself at Quien\nSabe on Hilma's birthday, empty-handed, and, on leaving Genslinger's\nhouse, he turned his pony's head toward the business part of the town\nagain pulling up in front of the jeweller's, just as the clerk was\ntaking down the shutters.\n\nAt the jeweller's, he purchased a little brooch for Hilma and at the\ncigar stand in the lobby of the Yosemite House, a box of superfine\ncigars, which, when it was too late, he realised that the master\nof Quien Sabe would never smoke, holding, as he did, with defiant\ninconsistency, to miserable weeds, black, bitter, and flagrantly\ndoctored, which he bought, three for a nickel, at Guadalajara.\n\nPresley arrived at Quien Sabe nearly half an hour behind the appointed\ntime; but, as he had expected, the party were in no way ready to start.\nThe carry-all, its horses covered with white fly-nets, stood under a\ntree near the house, young Vacca dozing on the seat. Hilma and Sidney,\nthe latter exuberant with a gayety that all but brought the tears to\nPresley's eyes, were making sandwiches on the back porch. Mrs. Dyke was\nnowhere to be seen, and Annixter was shaving himself in his bedroom.\n\nThis latter put a half-lathered face out of the window as Presley\ncantered through the gate, and waved his razor with a beckoning motion.\n\n“Come on in, Pres,” he cried. “Nobody's ready yet. You're hours ahead of\ntime.”\n\nPresley came into the bedroom, his huge spur clinking on the straw\nmatting. Annixter was without coat, vest or collar, his blue silk\nsuspenders hung in loops over either hip, his hair was disordered, the\ncrown lock stiffer than ever.\n\n“Glad to see you, old boy,” he announced, as Presley came in. “No, don't\nshake hands, I'm all lather. Here, find a chair, will you? I won't be\nlong.”\n\n“I thought you said ten o'clock,” observed Presley, sitting down on the\nedge of the bed.\n\n“Well, I did, but----”\n\n“But, then again, in a way, you didn't, hey?” his friend interrupted.\n\nAnnixter grunted good-humouredly, and turned to strop his razor. Presley\nlooked with suspicious disfavour at his suspenders.\n\n“Why is it,” he observed, “that as soon as a man is about to get\nmarried, he buys himself pale blue suspenders, silk ones? Think of it.\nYou, Buck Annixter, with sky-blue, silk suspenders. It ought to be a\nstrap and a nail.”\n\n“Old fool,” observed Annixter, whose repartee was the heaving of brick\nbats. “Say,” he continued, holding the razor from his face, and jerking\nhis head over his shoulder, while he looked at Presley's reflection\nin his mirror; “say, look around. Isn't this a nifty little room? We\nrefitted the whole house, you know. Notice she's all painted?”\n\n“I have been looking around,” answered Presley, sweeping the room with a\nseries of glances. He forebore criticism. Annixter was so boyishly proud\nof the effect that it would have been unkind to have undeceived him.\nPresley looked at the marvellous, department-store bed of brass, with\nits brave, gay canopy; the mill-made wash-stand, with its pitcher and\nbowl of blinding red and green china, the straw-framed lithographs of\nsymbolic female figures against the multi-coloured, new wall-paper; the\ninadequate spindle chairs of white and gold; the sphere of tissue paper\nhanging from the gas fixture, and the plumes of pampas grass tacked\nto the wall at artistic angles, and overhanging two astonishing oil\npaintings, in dazzling golden frames.\n\n“Say, how about those paintings, Pres?” inquired Annixter a little\nuneasily. “I don't know whether they're good or not. They were painted\nby a three-fingered Chinaman in Monterey, and I got the lot for thirty\ndollars, frames thrown in. Why, I think the frames alone are worth\nthirty dollars.”\n\n“Well, so do I,” declared Presley. He hastened to change the subject.\n\n“Buck,” he said, “I hear you've brought Mrs. Dyke and Sidney to live\nwith you. You know, I think that's rather white of you.”\n\n“Oh, rot, Pres,” muttered Annixter, turning abruptly to his shaving.\n\n“And you can't fool me, either, old man,” Presley continued. “You're\ngiving this picnic as much for Mrs. Dyke and the little tad as you are\nfor your wife, just to cheer them up a bit.”\n\n“Oh, pshaw, you make me sick.”\n\n“Well, that's the right thing to do, Buck, and I'm as glad for your sake\nas I am for theirs. There was a time when you would have let them all go\nto grass, and never so much as thought of them. I don't want to seem to\nbe officious, but you've changed for the better, old man, and I guess\nI know why. She--” Presley caught his friend's eye, and added gravely,\n“She's a good woman, Buck.”\n\nAnnixter turned around abruptly, his face flushing under its lather.\n\n“Pres,” he exclaimed, “she's made a man of me. I was a machine before,\nand if another man, or woman, or child got in my way, I rode 'em down,\nand I never DREAMED of anybody else but myself. But as soon as I woke up\nto the fact that I really loved her, why, it was glory hallelujah all in\na minute, and, in a way, I kind of loved everybody then, and wanted to\nbe everybody's friend. And I began to see that a fellow can't live\nFOR himself any more than he can live BY himself. He's got to think of\nothers. If he's got brains, he's got to think for the poor ducks that\nhaven't 'em, and not give 'em a boot in the backsides because they\nhappen to be stupid; and if he's got money, he's got to help those that\nare busted, and if he's got a house, he's got to think of those that\nain't got anywhere to go. I've got a whole lot of ideas since I began\nto love Hilma, and just as soon as I can, I'm going to get in and HELP\npeople, and I'm going to keep to that idea the rest of my natural life.\nThat ain't much of a religion, but it's the best I've got, and Henry\nWard Beecher couldn't do any more than that. And it's all come about\nbecause of Hilma, and because we cared for each other.”\n\nPresley jumped up, and caught Annixter about the shoulders with one\narm, gripping his hand hard. This absurd figure, with dangling silk\nsuspenders, lathered chin, and tearful eyes, seemed to be suddenly\ninvested with true nobility. Beside this blundering struggle to do\nright, to help his fellows, Presley's own vague schemes, glittering\nsystems of reconstruction, collapsed to ruin, and he himself, with all\nhis refinement, with all his poetry, culture, and education, stood, a\nbungler at the world's workbench.\n\n“You're all RIGHT, old man,” he exclaimed, unable to think of anything\nadequate. “You're all right. That's the way to talk, and here, by the\nway, I brought you a box of cigars.”\n\nAnnixter stared as Presley laid the box on the edge of the washstand.\n\n“Old fool,” he remarked, “what in hell did you do that for?”\n\n“Oh, just for fun.”\n\n“I suppose they're rotten stinkodoras, or you wouldn't give 'em away.”\n\n“This cringing gratitude--” Presley began.\n\n“Shut up,” shouted Annixter, and the incident was closed.\n\nAnnixter resumed his shaving, and Presley lit a cigarette.\n\n“Any news from Washington?” he queried.\n\n“Nothing that's any good,” grunted Annixter. “Hello,” he added, raising\nhis head, “there's somebody in a hurry for sure.”\n\nThe noise of a horse galloping so fast that the hoof-beats sounded in\none uninterrupted rattle, abruptly made itself heard. The noise was\ncoming from the direction of the road that led from the Mission to Quien\nSabe. With incredible swiftness, the hoof-beats drew nearer. There was\nthat in their sound which brought Presley to his feet. Annixter threw\nopen the window.\n\n“Runaway,” exclaimed Presley.\n\nAnnixter, with thoughts of the Railroad, and the “Jumping” of the ranch,\nflung his hand to his hip pocket.\n\n“What is it, Vacca?” he cried.\n\nYoung Vacca, turning in his seat in the carryall, was looking up the\nroad. All at once, he jumped from his place, and dashed towards the\nwindow. “Dyke,” he shouted. “Dyke, it's Dyke.”\n\nWhile the words were yet in his mouth, the sound of the hoof-beats rose\nto a roar, and a great, bell-toned voice shouted:\n\n“Annixter, Annixter, Annixter!”\n\nIt was Dyke's voice, and the next instant he shot into view in the open\nsquare in front of the house.\n\n“Oh, my God!” cried Presley.\n\nThe ex-engineer threw the horse on its haunches, springing from the\nsaddle; and, as he did so, the beast collapsed, shuddering, to the\nground. Annixter sprang from the window, and ran forward, Presley\nfollowing.\n\nThere was Dyke, hatless, his pistol in his hand, a gaunt terrible figure\nthe beard immeasurably long, the cheeks fallen in, the eyes sunken. His\nclothes ripped and torn by weeks of flight and hiding in the chaparral,\nwere ragged beyond words, the boots were shreds of leather, bloody to\nthe ankle with furious spurring.\n\n“Annixter,” he shouted, and again, rolling his sunken eyes, “Annixter,\nAnnixter!”\n\n“Here, here,” cried Annixter.\n\nThe other turned, levelling his pistol.\n\n“Give me a horse, give me a horse, quick, do you hear? Give me a horse,\nor I'll shoot.”\n\n“Steady, steady. That won't do. You know me, Dyke. We're friends here.”\n\nThe other lowered his weapon.\n\n“I know, I know,” he panted. “I'd forgotten. I'm unstrung, Mr. Annixter,\nand I'm running for my life. They're not ten minutes behind me.”\n\n“Come on, come on,” shouted Annixter, dashing stablewards, his\nsuspenders flying.\n\n“Here's a horse.”\n\n“Mine?” exclaimed Presley. “He wouldn't carry you a mile.”\n\nAnnixter was already far ahead, trumpeting orders.\n\n“The buckskin,” he yelled. “Get her out, Billy. Where's the stable-man?\nGet out that buckskin. Get out that saddle.”\n\nThen followed minutes of furious haste, Presley, Annixter, Billy the\nstable-man, and Dyke himself, darting hither and thither about the\nyellow mare, buckling, strapping, cinching, their lips pale, their\nfingers trembling with excitement.\n\n“Want anything to eat?” Annixter's head was under the saddle flap as he\ntore at the cinch. “Want anything to eat? Want any money? Want a gun?”\n\n“Water,” returned Dyke. “They've watched every spring. I'm killed with\nthirst.”\n\n“There's the hydrant. Quick now.”\n\n“I got as far as the Kern River, but they turned me back,” he said\nbetween breaths as he drank.\n\n“Don't stop to talk.”\n\n“My mother, and the little tad----”\n\n“I'm taking care of them. They're stopping with me.”\n\nHere?\n\n“You won't see 'em; by the Lord, you won't. You'll get away. Where's\nthat back cinch strap, BILLY? God damn it, are you going to let him be\nshot before he can get away? Now, Dyke, up you go. She'll kill herself\nrunning before they can catch you.”\n\n“God bless you, Annixter. Where's the little tad? Is she well, Annixter,\nand the mother? Tell them----”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes. All clear, Pres? Let her have her own gait, Dyke.\nYou're on the best horse in the county now. Let go her head, Billy. Now,\nDyke,--shake hands? You bet I will. That's all right. Yes, God bless\nyou. Let her go. You're OFF.”\n\nAnswering the goad of the spur, and already quivering with the\nexcitement of the men who surrounded her, the buckskin cleared the\nstable-corral in two leaps; then, gathering her legs under her, her head\nlow, her neck stretched out, swung into the road from out the driveway\ndisappearing in a blur of dust.\n\nWith the agility of a monkey, young Vacca swung himself into the\nframework of the artesian well, clambering aloft to its very top. He\nswept the country with a glance.\n\n“Well?” demanded Annixter from the ground. The others cocked their heads\nto listen.\n\n“I see him; I see him!” shouted Vacca. “He's going like the devil. He's\nheaded for Guadalajara.”\n\n“Look back, up the road, toward the Mission. Anything there?”\n\nThe answer came down in a shout of apprehension.\n\n“There's a party of men. Three or four--on horse-back. There's dogs with\n'em. They're coming this way. Oh, I can hear the dogs. And, say, oh,\nsay, there's another party coming down the Lower Road, going towards\nGuadalajara, too. They got guns. I can see the shine of the barrels.\nAnd, oh, Lord, say, there's three more men on horses coming down on\nthe jump from the hills on the Los Muertos stock range. They're making\ntowards Guadalajara. And I can hear the courthouse bell in Bonneville\nringing. Say, the whole county is up.”\n\nAs young Vacca slid down to the ground, two small black-and-tan hounds,\nwith flapping ears and lolling tongues, loped into view on the road in\nfront of the house. They were grey with dust, their noses were to the\nground. At the gate where Dyke had turned into the ranch house\ngrounds, they halted in confusion a moment. One started to follow the\nhighwayman's trail towards the stable corral, but the other, quartering\nover the road with lightning swiftness, suddenly picked up the new\nscent leading on towards Guadalajara. He tossed his head in the air, and\nPresley abruptly shut his hands over his ears.\n\nAh, that terrible cry! deep-toned, reverberating like the bourdon of a\ngreat bell. It was the trackers exulting on the trail of the pursued,\nthe prolonged, raucous howl, eager, ominous, vibrating with the alarm of\nthe tocsin, sullen with the heavy muffling note of death. But close upon\nthe bay of the hounds, came the gallop of horses. Five men, their eyes\nupon the hounds, their rifles across their pommels, their horses reeking\nand black with sweat, swept by in a storm of dust, glinting hoofs, and\nstreaming manes.\n\n“That was Delaney's gang,” exclaimed Annixter. “I saw him.”\n\n“The other was that chap Christian,” said Vacca, “S. Behrman's cousin.\nHe had two deputies with him; and the chap in the white slouch hat was\nthe sheriff from Visalia.”\n\n“By the Lord, they aren't far behind,” declared Annixter.\n\nAs the men turned towards the house again they saw Hilma and Mrs. Dyke\nin the doorway of the little house where the latter lived. They were\nlooking out, bewildered, ignorant of what had happened. But on the\nporch of the Ranch house itself, alone, forgotten in the excitement,\nSidney--the little tad--stood, with pale face and serious, wide-open\neyes. She had seen everything, and had understood. She said nothing. Her\nhead inclined towards the roadway, she listened to the faint and distant\nbaying of the dogs.\n\nDyke thundered across the railway tracks by the depot at Guadalajara not\nfive minutes ahead of his pursuers. Luck seemed to have deserted him.\nThe station, usually so quiet, was now occupied by the crew of a freight\ntrain that lay on the down track; while on the up line, near at hand and\nheaded in the same direction, was a detached locomotive, whose engineer\nand fireman recognized him, he was sure, as the buckskin leaped across\nthe rails.\n\nHe had had no time to formulate a plan since that morning, when,\ntortured with thirst, he had ventured near the spring at the headwaters\nof Broderson Creek, on Quien Sabe, and had all but fallen into the hands\nof the posse that had been watching for that very move. It was useless\nnow to regret that he had tried to foil pursuit by turning back on\nhis tracks to regain the mountains east of Bonneville. Now Delaney was\nalmost on him. To distance that posse, was the only thing to be thought\nof now. It was no longer a question of hiding till pursuit should flag;\nthey had driven him out from the shelter of the mountains, down into\nthis populous countryside, where an enemy might be met with at every\nturn of the road. Now it was life or death. He would either escape or be\nkilled. He knew very well that he would never allow himself to be taken\nalive. But he had no mind to be killed--to turn and fight--till escape\nwas blocked. His one thought was to leave pursuit behind.\n\nWeeks of flight had sharpened Dyke's every sense. As he turned into the\nUpper Road beyond Guadalajara, he saw the three men galloping down from\nDerrick's stock range, making for the road ahead of him. They would cut\nhim off there. He swung the buckskin about. He must take the Lower\nRoad across Los Muertos from Guadalajara, and he must reach it before\nDelaney's dogs and posse. Back he galloped, the buckskin measuring her\nlength with every leap. Once more the station came in sight. Rising in\nhis stirrups, he looked across the fields in the direction of the Lower\nRoad. There was a cloud of dust there. From a wagon? No, horses on\nthe run, and their riders were armed! He could catch the flash of gun\nbarrels. They were all closing in on him, converging on Guadalajara by\nevery available road. The Upper Road west of Guadalajara led straight to\nBonneville. That way was impossible. Was he in a trap? Had the time for\nfighting come at last?\n\nBut as Dyke neared the depot at Guadalajara, his eye fell upon the\ndetached locomotive that lay quietly steaming on the up line, and with\na thrill of exultation, he remembered that he was an engineer born and\nbred. Delaney's dogs were already to be heard, and the roll of hoofs on\nthe Lower Road was dinning in his ears, as he leaped from the buckskin\nbefore the depot. The train crew scattered like frightened sheep before\nhim, but Dyke ignored them. His pistol was in his hand as, once more on\nfoot, he sprang toward the lone engine.\n\n“Out of the cab,” he shouted. “Both of you. Quick, or I'll kill you\nboth.”\n\nThe two men tumbled from the iron apron of the tender as Dyke swung\nhimself up, dropping his pistol on the floor of the cab and reaching\nwith the old instinct for the familiar levers. The great compound hissed\nand trembled as the steam was released, and the huge drivers stirred,\nturning slowly on the tracks. But there was a shout. Delaney's posse,\ndogs and men, swung into view at the turn of the road, their figures\nleaning over as they took the curve at full speed. Dyke threw everything\nwide open and caught up his revolver. From behind came the challenge of\na Winchester. The party on the Lower Road were even closer than Delaney.\nThey had seen his manoeuvre, and the first shot of the fight shivered\nthe cab windows above the engineer's head.\n\nBut spinning futilely at first, the drivers of the engine at last caught\nthe rails. The engine moved, advanced, travelled past the depot and\nthe freight train, and gathering speed, rolled out on the track beyond.\nSmoke, black and boiling, shot skyward from the stack; not a joint that\ndid not shudder with the mighty strain of the steam; but the great iron\nbrute--one of Baldwin's newest and best--came to call, obedient and\ndocile as soon as ever the great pulsing heart of it felt a master hand\nupon its levers. It gathered its speed, bracing its steel muscles, its\nthews of iron, and roared out upon the open track, filling the air with\nthe rasp of its tempest-breath, blotting the sunshine with the belch\nof its hot, thick smoke. Already it was lessening in the distance, when\nDelaney, Christian, and the sheriff of Visalia dashed up to the station.\n\nThe posse had seen everything.\n\n“Stuck. Curse the luck!” vociferated the cow-Puncher.\n\nBut the sheriff was already out of the saddle and into the telegraph\noffice.\n\n“There's a derailing switch between here and Pixley, isn't there?” he\ncried.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Wire ahead to open it. We'll derail him there. Come on;” he turned to\nDelaney and the others. They sprang into the cab of the locomotive that\nwas attached to the freight train.\n\n“Name of the State of California,” shouted the sheriff to the bewildered\nengineer. “Cut off from your train.”\n\nThe sheriff was a man to be obeyed without hesitating. Time was not\nallowed the crew of the freight train for debating as to the right or\nthe wrong of requisitioning the engine, and before anyone thought of the\nsafety or danger of the affair, the freight engine was already flying\nout upon the down line, hot in pursuit of Dyke, now far ahead upon the\nup track.\n\n“I remember perfectly well there's a derailing switch between here and\nPixley,” shouted the sheriff above the roar of the locomotive. “They use\nit in case they have to derail runaway engines. It runs right off into\nthe country. We'll pile him up there. Ready with your guns, boys.”\n\n“If we should meet another train coming up on this track----” protested\nthe frightened engineer.\n\n“Then we'd jump or be smashed. Hi! look! There he is.” As the freight\nengine rounded a curve, Dyke's engine came into view, shooting on some\nquarter of a mile ahead of them, wreathed in whirling smoke.\n\n“The switch ain't much further on,” clamoured the engineer. “You can see\nPixley now.”\n\nDyke, his hand on the grip of the valve that controlled the steam, his\nhead out of the cab window, thundered on. He was back in his old place\nagain; once more he was the engineer; once more he felt the engine\nquiver under him; the familiar noises were in his ears; the familiar\nbuffeting of the wind surged, roaring at his face; the familiar odours\nof hot steam and smoke reeked in his nostrils, and on either side of\nhim, parallel panoramas, the two halves of the landscape sliced, as it\nwere, in two by the clashing wheels of his engine, streamed by in green\nand brown blurs.\n\nHe found himself settling to the old position on the cab seat, leaning\non his elbow from the window, one hand on the controller. All at once,\nthe instinct of the pursuit that of late had become so strong within\nhim, prompted him to shoot a glance behind. He saw the other engine on\nthe down line, plunging after him, rocking from side to side with the\nfury of its gallop. Not yet had he shaken the trackers from his heels;\nnot yet was he out of the reach of danger. He set his teeth and,\nthrowing open the fire-door, stoked vigorously for a few moments. The\nindicator of the steam gauge rose; his speed increased; a glance at\nthe telegraph poles told him he was doing his fifty miles an hour. The\nfreight engine behind him was never built for that pace. Barring the\nterrible risk of accident, his chances were good.\n\nBut suddenly--the engineer dominating the highway-man--he shut off his\nsteam and threw back his brake to the extreme notch. Directly ahead\nof him rose a semaphore, placed at a point where evidently a derailing\nswitch branched from the line. The semaphore's arm was dropped over the\ntrack, setting the danger signal that showed the switch was open.\n\nIn an instant, Dyke saw the trick. They had meant to smash him here;\nhad been clever enough, quick-witted enough to open the switch, but had\nforgotten the automatic semaphore that worked simultaneously with the\nmovement of the rails. To go forward was certain destruction. Dyke\nreversed. There was nothing for it but to go back. With a wrench and a\nspasm of all its metal fibres, the great compound braced itself, sliding\nwith rigid wheels along the rails. Then, as Dyke applied the reverse,\nit drew back from the greater danger, returning towards the less.\nInevitably now the two engines, one on the up, the other on the down\nline, must meet and pass each other.\n\nDyke released the levers, reaching for his revolver. The engineer once\nmore became the highwayman, in peril of his life. Now, beyond all doubt,\nthe time for fighting was at hand.\n\nThe party in the heavy freight engine, that lumbered after in pursuit,\ntheir eyes fixed on the smudge of smoke on ahead that marked the path of\nthe fugitive, suddenly raised a shout.\n\n“He's stopped. He's broke down. Watch, now, and see if he jumps off.”\n\n“Broke NOTHING. HE'S COMING BACK. Ready, now, he's got to pass us.”\n\nThe engineer applied the brakes, but the heavy freight locomotive, far\nless mobile than Dyke's flyer, was slow to obey. The smudge on the rails\nahead grew swiftly larger.\n\n“He's coming. He's coming--look out, there's a shot. He's shooting\nalready.”\n\nA bright, white sliver of wood leaped into the air from the sooty window\nsill of the cab.\n\n“Fire on him! Fire on him!”\n\nWhile the engines were yet two hundred yards apart, the duel began, shot\nanswering shot, the sharp staccato reports punctuating the thunder of\nwheels and the clamour of steam.\n\nThen the ground trembled and rocked; a roar as of heavy ordnance\ndeveloped with the abruptness of an explosion. The two engines passed\neach other, the men firing the while, emptying their revolvers,\nshattering wood, shivering glass, the bullets clanging against the metal\nwork as they struck and struck and struck. The men leaned from the\ncabs towards each other, frantic with excitement, shouting curses, the\nengines rocking, the steam roaring; confusion whirling in the scene\nlike the whirl of a witch's dance, the white clouds of steam, the black\neddies from the smokestack, the blue wreaths from the hot mouths of\nrevolvers, swirling together in a blinding maze of vapour, spinning\naround them, dazing them, dizzying them, while the head rang with\nhideous clamour and the body twitched and trembled with the leap and jar\nof the tumult of machinery.\n\nRoaring, clamouring, reeking with the smell of powder and hot oil,\nspitting death, resistless, huge, furious, an abrupt vision of chaos,\nfaces, rage-distorted, peering through smoke, hands gripping outward\nfrom sudden darkness, prehensile, malevolent; terrible as thunder, swift\nas lightning, the two engines met and passed.\n\n“He's hit,” cried Delaney. “I know I hit him. He can't go far now. After\nhim again. He won't dare go through Bonneville.”\n\nIt was true. Dyke had stood between cab and tender throughout all the\nduel, exposed, reckless, thinking only of attack and not of defence, and\na bullet from one of the pistols had grazed his hip. How serious was the\nwound he did not know, but he had no thought of giving up. He tore back\nthrough the depot at Guadalajara in a storm of bullets, and, clinging to\nthe broken window ledge of his cab, was carried towards Bonneville, on\nover the Long Trestle and Broderson Creek and through the open country\nbetween the two ranches of Los Muertos and Quien Sabe.\n\nBut to go on to Bonneville meant certain death. Before, as well as\nbehind him, the roads were now blocked. Once more he thought of the\nmountains. He resolved to abandon the engine and make another final\nattempt to get into the shelter of the hills in the northernmost corner\nof Quien Sabe. He set his teeth. He would not give in. There was one\nmore fight left in him yet. Now to try the final hope.\n\nHe slowed the engine down, and, reloading his revolver, jumped from the\nplatform to the road. He looked about him, listening. All around him\nwidened an ocean of wheat. There was no one in sight.\n\nThe released engine, alone, unattended, drew slowly away from him,\njolting ponderously over the rail joints. As he watched it go, a certain\nindefinite sense of abandonment, even in that moment, came over Dyke.\nHis last friend, that also had been his first, was leaving him. He\nremembered that day, long ago, when he had opened the throttle of his\nfirst machine. To-day, it was leaving him alone, his last friend turning\nagainst him. Slowly it was going back towards Bonneville, to the shops\nof the Railroad, the camp of the enemy, that enemy that had ruined\nhim and wrecked him. For the last time in his life, he had been the\nengineer. Now, once more, he became the highwayman, the outlaw against\nwhom all hands were raised, the fugitive skulking in the mountains,\nlistening for the cry of dogs.\n\nBut he would not give in. They had not broken him yet. Never, while he\ncould fight, would he allow S. Behrman the triumph of his capture.\n\nHe found his wound was not bad. He plunged into the wheat on Quien Sabe,\nmaking northward for a division house that rose with its surrounding\ntrees out of the wheat like an island. He reached it, the blood\nsquelching in his shoes. But the sight of two men, Portuguese\nfarm-hands, staring at him from an angle of the barn, abruptly roused\nhim to action. He sprang forward with peremptory commands, demanding a\nhorse.\n\nAt Guadalajara, Delaney and the sheriff descended from the freight\nengine.\n\n“Horses now,” declared the sheriff. “He won't go into Bonneville, that's\ncertain. He'll leave the engine between here and there, and strike off\ninto the country. We'll follow after him now in the saddle. Soon as he\nleaves his engine, HE'S on foot. We've as good as got him now.”\n\nTheir horses, including even the buckskin mare that Dyke had ridden,\nwere still at the station. The party swung themselves up, Delaney\nexclaiming, “Here's MY mount,” as he bestrode the buckskin.\n\nAt Guadalajara, the two bloodhounds were picked up again. Urging the\njaded horses to a gallop, the party set off along the Upper Road,\nkeeping a sharp lookout to right and left for traces of Dyke's\nabandonment of the engine.\n\nThree miles beyond the Long Trestle, they found S. Behrman holding his\nsaddle horse by the bridle, and looking attentively at a trail that had\nbeen broken through the standing wheat on Quien Sabe. The party drew\nrein.\n\n“The engine passed me on the tracks further up, and empty,” said S.\nBehrman. “Boys, I think he left her here.”\n\nBut before anyone could answer, the bloodhounds gave tongue again, as\nthey picked up the scent.\n\n“That's him,” cried S. Behrman. “Get on, boys.”\n\nThey dashed forward, following the hounds. S. Behrman laboriously\nclimbed to his saddle, panting, perspiring, mopping the roll of fat over\nhis coat collar, and turned in after them, trotting along far in the\nrear, his great stomach and tremulous jowl shaking with the horse's\ngait.\n\n“What a day,” he murmured. “What a day.”\n\nDyke's trail was fresh, and was followed as easily as if made on\nnew-fallen snow. In a short time, the posse swept into the open\nspace around the division house. The two Portuguese were still there,\nwide-eyed, terribly excited.\n\nYes, yes, Dyke had been there not half an hour since, had held them up,\ntaken a horse and galloped to the northeast, towards the foothills at\nthe headwaters of Broderson Creek.\n\nOn again, at full gallop, through the young wheat, trampling it under\nthe flying hoofs; the hounds hot on the scent, baying continually; the\nmen, on fresh mounts, secured at the division house, bending forward in\ntheir saddles, spurring relentlessly. S. Behrman jolted along far in the\nrear.\n\nAnd even then, harried through an open country, where there was no place\nto hide, it was a matter of amazement how long a chase the highwayman\nled them. Fences were passed; fences whose barbed wire had been slashed\napart by the fugitive's knife. The ground rose under foot; the hills\nwere at hand; still the pursuit held on. The sun, long past the\nmeridian, began to turn earthward. Would night come on before they were\nup with him?\n\n“Look! Look! There he is! Quick, there he goes!”\n\nHigh on the bare slope of the nearest hill, all the posse, looking in\nthe direction of Delaney's gesture, saw the figure of a horseman emerge\nfrom an arroyo, filled with chaparral, and struggle at a labouring\ngallop straight up the slope. Suddenly, every member of the party\nshouted aloud. The horse had fallen, pitching the rider from the saddle.\nThe man rose to his feet, caught at the bridle, missed it and the horse\ndashed on alone. The man, pausing for a second looked around, saw the\nchase drawing nearer, then, turning back, disappeared in the chaparral.\nDelaney raised a great whoop.\n\n“We've got you now.” Into the slopes and valleys of the hills dashed\nthe band of horsemen, the trail now so fresh that it could be easily\ndiscerned by all. On and on it led them, a furious, wild scramble\nstraight up the slopes. The minutes went by. The dry bed of a rivulet\nwas passed; then another fence; then a tangle of manzanita; a meadow of\nwild oats, full of agitated cattle; then an arroyo, thick with chaparral\nand scrub oaks, and then, without warning, the pistol shots ripped out\nand ran from rider to rider with the rapidity of a gatling discharge,\nand one of the deputies bent forward in the saddle, both hands to his\nface, the blood jetting from between his fingers.\n\nDyke was there, at bay at last, his back against a bank of rock, the\nroots of a fallen tree serving him as a rampart, his revolver smoking in\nhis hand.\n\n“You're under arrest, Dyke,” cried the sheriff. “It's not the least use\nto fight. The whole country is up.”\n\nDyke fired again, the shot splintering the foreleg of the horse the\nsheriff rode.\n\nThe posse, four men all told--the wounded deputy having crawled out\nof the fight after Dyke's first shot--fell back after the preliminary\nfusillade, dismounted, and took shelter behind rocks and trees. On that\nrugged ground, fighting from the saddle was impracticable. Dyke, in the\nmeanwhile, held his fire, for he knew that, once his pistol was empty,\nhe would never be allowed time to reload.\n\n“Dyke,” called the sheriff again, “for the last time, I summon you to\nsurrender.”\n\nDyke did not reply. The sheriff, Delaney, and the man named Christian\nconferred together in a low voice. Then Delaney and Christian left\nthe others, making a wide detour up the sides of the arroyo, to gain a\nposition to the left and somewhat to the rear of Dyke.\n\nBut it was at this moment that S. Behrman arrived. It could not be said\nwhether it was courage or carelessness that brought the Railroad's agent\nwithin reach of Dyke's revolver. Possibly he was really a brave man;\npossibly occupied with keeping an uncertain seat upon the back of his\nlabouring, scrambling horse, he had not noticed that he was so close\nupon that scene of battle. He certainly did not observe the posse lying\nupon the ground behind sheltering rocks and trees, and before anyone\ncould call a warning, he had ridden out into the open, within thirty\npaces of Dyke's intrenchment.\n\nDyke saw. There was the arch-enemy; the man of all men whom he most\nhated; the man who had ruined him, who had exasperated him and driven\nhim to crime, and who had instigated tireless pursuit through all those\npast terrible weeks. Suddenly, inviting death, he leaped up and forward;\nhe had forgotten all else, all other considerations, at the sight of\nthis man. He would die, gladly, so only that S. Behrman died before him.\n\n“I've got YOU, anyway,” he shouted, as he ran forward.\n\nThe muzzle of the weapon was not ten feet from S. Behrman's huge stomach\nas Dyke drew the trigger. Had the cartridge exploded, death, certain and\nswift, would have followed, but at this, of all moments, the revolver\nmissed fire.\n\nS. Behrman, with an unexpected agility, leaped from the saddle, and,\nkeeping his horse between him and Dyke, ran, dodging and ducking, from\ntree to tree. His first shot a failure, Dyke fired again and again at\nhis enemy, emptying his revolver, reckless of consequences. His every\nshot went wild, and before he could draw his knife, the whole posse was\nupon him.\n\nWithout concerted plans, obeying no signal but the promptings of the\nimpulse that snatched, unerring, at opportunity--the men, Delaney and\nChristian from one side, the sheriff and the deputy from the other,\nrushed in. They did not fire. It was Dyke alive they wanted. One of them\nhad a riata snatched from a saddle-pommel, and with this they tried to\nbind him.\n\nThe fight was four to one--four men with law on their side, to one\nwounded freebooter, half-starved, exhausted by days and nights of\npursuit, worn down with loss of sleep, thirst, privation, and the\ngrinding, nerve-racking consciousness of an ever-present peril.\n\nThey swarmed upon him from all sides, gripping at his legs, at his\narms, his throat, his head, striking, clutching, kicking, falling to\nthe ground, rolling over and over, now under, now above, now staggering\nforward, now toppling back. Still Dyke fought. Through that scrambling,\nstruggling group, through that maze of twisting bodies, twining arms,\nstraining legs, S. Behrman saw him from moment to moment, his face\nflaming, his eyes bloodshot, his hair matted with sweat. Now he was\ndown, pinned under, two men across his legs, and now half-way up again,\nstruggling to one knee. Then upright again, with half his enemies\nhanging on his back. His colossal strength seemed doubled; when his\narms were held, he fought bull-like with his head. A score of times, it\nseemed as if they were about to secure him finally and irrevocably, and\nthen he would free an arm, a leg, a shoulder, and the group that, for\nthe fraction of an instant, had settled, locked and rigid, on its prey,\nwould break up again as he flung a man from him, reeling and bloody, and\nhe himself twisting, squirming, dodging, his great fists working like\npistons, backed away, dragging and carrying the others with him.\n\nMore than once, he loosened almost every grip, and for an instant stood\nnearly free, panting, rolling his eyes, his clothes torn from his body,\nbleeding, dripping with sweat, a terrible figure, nearly free. The\nsheriff, under his breath, uttered an exclamation:\n\n“By God, he'll get away yet.”\n\nS. Behrman watched the fight complacently.\n\n“That all may show obstinacy,” he commented, “but it don't show common\nsense.”\n\nYet, however Dyke might throw off the clutches and fettering embraces\nthat encircled him, however he might disintegrate and scatter the band\nof foes that heaped themselves upon him, however he might gain one\ninstant of comparative liberty, some one of his assailants always hung,\ndoggedly, blindly to an arm, a leg, or a foot, and the others, drawing a\nsecond's breath, closed in again, implacable, unconquerable, ferocious,\nlike hounds upon a wolf.\n\nAt length, two of the men managed to bring Dyke's wrists close enough\ntogether to allow the sheriff to snap the handcuffs on. Even then, Dyke,\nclasping his hands, and using the handcuffs themselves as a weapon,\nknocked down Delaney by the crushing impact of the steel bracelets upon\nthe cow-puncher's forehead. But he could no longer protect himself from\nattacks from behind, and the riata was finally passed around his body,\npinioning his arms to his sides. After this it was useless to resist.\n\nThe wounded deputy sat with his back to a rock, holding his broken jaw\nin both hands. The sheriff's horse, with its splintered foreleg, would\nhave to be shot. Delaney's head was cut from temple to cheekbone. The\nright wrist of the sheriff was all but dislocated. The other deputy was\nso exhausted he had to be helped to his horse. But Dyke was taken.\n\nHe himself had suddenly lapsed into semi-unconsciousness, unable to\nwalk. They sat him on the buckskin, S. Behrman supporting him, the\nsheriff, on foot, leading the horse by the bridle. The little procession\nformed, and descended from the hills, turning in the direction of\nBonneville. A special train, one car and an engine, would be made up\nthere, and the highwayman would sleep in the Visalia jail that night.\n\nDelaney and S. Behrman found themselves in the rear of the cavalcade as\nit moved off. The cow-puncher turned to his chief:\n\n“Well, captain,” he said, still panting, as he bound up his forehead;\n“well--we GOT him.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nOsterman cut his wheat that summer before any of the other ranchers,\nand as soon as his harvest was over organized a jack-rabbit drive.\nLike Annixter's barn-dance, it was to be an event in which all the\ncountry-side should take part. The drive was to begin on the most\nwestern division of the Osterman ranch, whence it would proceed towards\nthe southeast, crossing into the northern part of Quien Sabe--on which\nAnnixter had sown no wheat--and ending in the hills at the headwaters of\nBroderson Creek, where a barbecue was to be held.\n\nEarly on the morning of the day of the drive, as Harran and Presley were\nsaddling their horses before the stables on Los Muertos, the foreman,\nPhelps, remarked:\n\n“I was into town last night, and I hear that Christian has been after\nRuggles early and late to have him put him in possession here on Los\nMuertos, and Delaney is doing the same for Quien Sabe.”\n\nIt was this man Christian, the real estate broker, and cousin of S.\nBehrman, one of the main actors in the drama of Dyke's capture, who\nhad come forward as a purchaser of Los Muertos when the Railroad had\nregraded its holdings on the ranches around Bonneville.\n\n“He claims, of course,” Phelps went on, “that when he bought Los Muertos\nof the Railroad he was guaranteed possession, and he wants the place in\ntime for the harvest.”\n\n“That's almost as thin,” muttered Harran as he thrust the bit into his\nhorse's mouth, “as Delaney buying Annixter's Home ranch. That slice\nof Quien Sabe, according to the Railroad's grading, is worth about ten\nthousand dollars; yes, even fifteen, and I don't believe Delaney is\nworth the price of a good horse. Why, those people don't even try to\npreserve appearances. Where would Christian find the money to buy Los\nMuertos? There's no one man in all Bonneville rich enough to do it.\nDamned rascals! as if we didn't see that Christian and Delaney are\nS. Behrman's right and left hands. Well, he'll get 'em cut off,” he\ncried with sudden fierceness, “if he comes too near the machine.”\n\n“How is it, Harran,” asked Presley as the two young men rode out of the\nstable yard, “how is it the Railroad gang can do anything before the\nSupreme Court hands down a decision?”\n\n“Well, you know how they talk,” growled Harran. “They have claimed that\nthe cases taken up to the Supreme Court were not test cases as WE claim\nthey ARE, and that because neither Annixter nor the Governor appealed,\nthey've lost their cases by default. It's the rottenest kind of sharp\npractice, but it won't do any good. The League is too strong. They won't\ndare move on us yet awhile. Why, Pres, the moment they'd try to jump\nany of these ranches around here, they would have six hundred rifles\ncracking at them as quick as how-do-you-do. Why, it would take a\nregiment of U. S. soldiers to put any one of us off our land. No, sir;\nthey know the League means business this time.”\n\nAs Presley and Harran trotted on along the county road they continually\npassed or overtook other horsemen, or buggies, carry-alls, buck-boards\nor even farm wagons, going in the same direction. These were full of the\nfarming people from all the country round about Bonneville, on their way\nto the rabbit drive--the same people seen at the barn-dance--in their\nSunday finest, the girls in muslin frocks and garden hats, the men with\nlinen dusters over their black clothes; the older women in prints\nand dotted calicoes. Many of these latter had already taken off their\nbonnets--the day was very hot--and pinning them in newspapers, stowed\nthem under the seats. They tucked their handkerchiefs into the collars\nof their dresses, or knotted them about their fat necks, to keep out\nthe dust. From the axle trees of the vehicles swung carefully covered\nbuckets of galvanised iron, in which the lunch was packed. The\nyounger children, the boys with great frilled collars, the girls with\nill-fitting shoes cramping their feet, leaned from the sides of buggy\nand carry-all, eating bananas and “macaroons,” staring about with\nox-like stolidity. Tied to the axles, the dogs followed the horses'\nhoofs with lolling tongues coated with dust.\n\nThe California summer lay blanket-wise and smothering over all the\nland. The hills, bone-dry, were browned and parched. The grasses and\nwild-oats, sear and yellow, snapped like glass filaments under foot. The\nroads, the bordering fences, even the lower leaves and branches of the\ntrees, were thick and grey with dust. All colour had been burned from\nthe landscape, except in the irrigated patches, that in the waste of\nbrown and dull yellow glowed like oases.\n\nThe wheat, now close to its maturity, had turned from pale yellow to\ngolden yellow, and from that to brown. Like a gigantic carpet, it spread\nitself over all the land. There was nothing else to be seen but the\nlimitless sea of wheat as far as the eye could reach, dry, rustling,\ncrisp and harsh in the rare breaths of hot wind out of the southeast.\nAs Harran and Presley went along the county road, the number of vehicles\nand riders increased. They overtook and passed Hooven and his family\nin the former's farm wagon, a saddled horse tied to the back board. The\nlittle Dutchman, wearing the old frock coat of Magnus Derrick, and a\nnew broad-brimmed straw hat, sat on the front seat with Mrs. Hooven. The\nlittle girl Hilda, and the older daughter Minna, were behind them on a\nboard laid across the sides of the wagon. Presley and Harran stopped to\nshake hands. “Say,” cried Hooven, exhibiting an old, but extremely well\nkept, rifle, “say, bei Gott, me, I tek some schatz at dose rebbit, you\nbedt. Ven he hef shtop to run und sit oop soh, bei der hind laigs on, I\noop mit der guhn und--bing! I cetch um.”\n\n“The marshals won't allow you to shoot, Bismarck,” observed Presley,\nlooking at Minna.\n\nHooven doubled up with merriment.\n\n“Ho! dot's hell of some fine joak. Me, I'M ONE OAF DOSE MAIRSCHELL\nMINE-SELLUF,” he roared with delight, beating his knee. To his notion,\nthe joke was irresistible. All day long, he could be heard repeating it.\n“Und Mist'r Praicelie, he say, 'Dose mairschell woand led you schoot,\nBismarck,' und ME, ach Gott, ME, aindt I mine-selluf one oaf dose\nmairschell?”\n\nAs the two friends rode on, Presley had in his mind the image of Minna\nHooven, very pretty in a clean gown of pink gingham, a cheap straw\nsailor hat from a Bonneville store on her blue black hair. He remembered\nher very pale face, very red lips and eyes of greenish blue,--a pretty\ngirl certainly, always trailing a group of men behind her. Her love\naffairs were the talk of all Los Muertos.\n\n“I hope that Hooven girl won't go to the bad,” Presley said to Harran.\n\n“Oh, she's all right,” the other answered. “There's nothing vicious\nabout Minna, and I guess she'll marry that foreman on the ditch gang,\nright enough.”\n\n“Well, as a matter of course, she's a good girl,” Presley hastened\nto reply, “only she's too pretty for a poor girl, and too sure of her\nprettiness besides. That's the kind,” he continued, “who would find it\npretty easy to go wrong if they lived in a city.”\n\nAround Caraher's was a veritable throng. Saddle horses and buggies by\nthe score were clustered underneath the shed or hitched to the railings\nin front of the watering trough. Three of Broderson's Portuguese tenants\nand a couple of workmen from the railroad shops in Bonneville were on\nthe porch, already very drunk.\n\nContinually, young men, singly or in groups, came from the door-way,\nwiping their lips with sidelong gestures of the hand. The whole place\nexhaled the febrile bustle of the saloon on a holiday morning.\n\nThe procession of teams streamed on through Bonneville, reenforced\nat every street corner. Along the Upper Road from Quien Sabe and\nGuadalajara came fresh auxiliaries, Spanish-Mexicans from the town\nitself,--swarthy young men on capering horses, dark-eyed girls and\nmatrons, in red and black and yellow, more Portuguese in brand-new\noveralls, smoking long thin cigars. Even Father Sarria appeared.\n\n“Look,” said Presley, “there goes Annixter and Hilma. He's got his\nbuckskin back.” The master of Quien Sabe, in top laced boots and\ncampaign hat, a cigar in his teeth, followed along beside the carry-all.\nHilma and Mrs. Derrick were on the back seat, young Vacca driving.\nHarran and Presley bowed, taking off their hats.\n\n“Hello, hello, Pres,” cried Annixter, over the heads of the intervening\ncrowd, standing up in his stirrups and waving a hand, “Great day! What a\nmob, hey? Say when this thing is over and everybody starts to walk into\nthe barbecue, come and have lunch with us. I'll look for you, you and\nHarran. Hello, Harran, where's the Governor?”\n\n“He didn't come to-day,” Harran shouted back, as the crowd carried him\nfurther away from Annixter. “Left him and old Broderson at Los Muertos.”\n\nThe throng emerged into the open country again, spreading out upon the\nOsterman ranch. From all directions could be seen horses and buggies\ndriving across the stubble, converging upon the rendezvous. Osterman's\nRanch house was left to the eastward; the army of the guests hurrying\nforward--for it began to be late--to where around a flag pole, flying\na red flag, a vast crowd of buggies and horses was already forming. The\nmarshals began to appear. Hooven, descending from the farm wagon, pinned\nhis white badge to his hat brim and mounted his horse. Osterman, in\nmarvellous riding clothes of English pattern, galloped up and down upon\nhis best thoroughbred, cracking jokes with everybody, chaffing, joshing,\nhis great mouth distended in a perpetual grin of amiability.\n\n“Stop here, stop here,” he vociferated, dashing along in front of\nPresley and Harran, waving his crop. The procession came to a halt,\nthe horses' heads pointing eastward. The line began to be formed. The\nmarshals perspiring, shouting, fretting, galloping about, urging this\none forward, ordering this one back, ranged the thousands of conveyances\nand cavaliers in a long line, shaped like a wide open crescent. Its\nwings, under the command of lieutenants, were slightly advanced. Far out\nbefore its centre Osterman took his place, delighted beyond expression\nat his conspicuousness, posing for the gallery, making his horse dance.\n\n“Wail, aindt dey gowun to gommence den bretty soohn,” exclaimed Mrs.\nHooven, who had taken her husband's place on the forward seat of the\nwagon.\n\n“I never was so warm,” murmured Minna, fanning herself with her hat. All\nseemed in readiness. For miles over the flat expanse of stubble, curved\nthe interminable lines of horses and vehicles. At a guess, nearly five\nthousand people were present. The drive was one of the largest ever\nheld. But no start was made; immobilized, the vast crescent stuck\nmotionless under the blazing sun. Here and there could be heard voices\nuplifted in jocular remonstrance.\n\n“Oh, I say, get a move on, somebody.”\n\n“ALL aboard.”\n\n“Say, I'll take root here pretty soon.”\n\nSome took malicious pleasure in starting false alarms.\n\n“Ah, HERE we go.”\n\n“Off, at last.”\n\n“We're off.”\n\nInvariably these jokes fooled some one in the line. An old man, or some\nold woman, nervous, hard of hearing, always gathered up the reins and\nstarted off, only to be hustled and ordered back into the line by the\nnearest marshal. This manoeuvre never failed to produce its effect of\nhilarity upon those near at hand. Everybody laughed at the blunderer,\nthe joker jeering audibly.\n\n“Hey, come back here.”\n\n“Oh, he's easy.”\n\n“Don't be in a hurry, Grandpa.”\n\n“Say, you want to drive all the rabbits yourself.”\n\nLater on, a certain group of these fellows started a huge “josh.”\n\n“Say, that's what we're waiting for, the 'do-funny.'”\n\n“The do-funny?”\n\n“Sure, you can't drive rabbits without the 'do-funny.'”\n\n“What's the do-funny?”\n\n“Oh, say, she don't know what the do-funny is. We can't start without\nit, sure. Pete went back to get it.”\n\n“Oh, you're joking me, there's no such thing.”\n\n“Well, aren't we WAITING for it?”\n\n“Oh, look, look,” cried some women in a covered rig. “See, they are\nstarting already 'way over there.”\n\nIn fact, it did appear as if the far extremity of the line was in\nmotion. Dust rose in the air above it.\n\n“They ARE starting. Why don't we start?”\n\n“No, they've stopped. False alarm.”\n\n“They've not, either. Why don't we move?”\n\nBut as one or two began to move off, the nearest marshal shouted\nwrathfully:\n\n“Get back there, get back there.”\n\n“Well, they've started over there.”\n\n“Get back, I tell you.”\n\n“Where's the 'do-funny?'”\n\n“Say, we're going to miss it all. They've all started over there.”\n\nA lieutenant came galloping along in front of the line, shouting:\n\n“Here, what's the matter here? Why don't you start?”\n\nThere was a great shout. Everybody simultaneously uttered a prolonged\n“Oh-h.”\n\n“We're off.”\n\n“Here we go for sure this time.”\n\n“Remember to keep the alignment,” roared the lieutenant. “Don't go too\nfast.”\n\nAnd the marshals, rushing here and there on their sweating horses to\npoints where the line bulged forward, shouted, waving their arms: “Not\ntoo fast, not too fast....Keep back here....Here, keep closer together\nhere. Do you want to let all the rabbits run back between you?”\n\nA great confused sound rose into the air,--the creaking of axles, the\njolt of iron tires over the dry clods, the click of brittle stubble\nunder the horses' hoofs, the barking of dogs, the shouts of conversation\nand laughter.\n\nThe entire line, horses, buggies, wagons, gigs, dogs, men and boys on\nfoot, and armed with clubs, moved slowly across the fields, sending up\na cloud of white dust, that hung above the scene like smoke. A brisk\ngaiety was in the air. Everyone was in the best of humor, calling\nfrom team to team, laughing, skylarking, joshing. Garnett, of the\nRuby Rancho, and Gethings, of the San Pablo, both on horseback, found\nthemselves side by side. Ignoring the drive and the spirit of the\noccasion, they kept up a prolonged and serious conversation on an\nexpected rise in the price of wheat. Dabney, also on horseback, followed\nthem, listening attentively to every word, but hazarding no remark.\n\nMrs. Derrick and Hilma sat in the back seat of the carry-all, behind\nyoung Vacca. Mrs. Derrick, a little disturbed by such a great concourse\nof people, frightened at the idea of the killing of so many rabbits,\ndrew back in her place, her young-girl eyes troubled and filled with\na vague distress. Hilma, very much excited, leaned from the carry-all,\nanxious to see everything, watching for rabbits, asking innumerable\nquestions of Annixter, who rode at her side.\n\nThe change that had been progressing in Hilma, ever since the night of\nthe famous barn-dance, now seemed to be approaching its climax; first\nthe girl, then the woman, last of all the Mother. Conscious dignity, a\nnew element in her character, developed. The shrinking, the timidity of\nthe girl just awakening to the consciousness of sex, passed away from\nher. The confusion, the troublous complexity of the woman, a mystery\neven to herself, disappeared. Motherhood dawned, the old simplicity\nof her maiden days came back to her. It was no longer a simplicity of\nignorance, but of supreme knowledge, the simplicity of the perfect, the\nsimplicity of greatness. She looked the world fearlessly in the eyes.\nAt last, the confusion of her ideas, like frightened birds, re-settling,\nadjusted itself, and she emerged from the trouble calm, serene,\nentering into her divine right, like a queen into the rule of a realm of\nperpetual peace.\n\nAnd with this, with the knowledge that the crown hung poised above\nher head, there came upon Hilma a gentleness infinitely beautiful,\ninfinitely pathetic; a sweetness that touched all who came near her\nwith the softness of a caress. She moved surrounded by an invisible\natmosphere of Love. Love was in her wide-opened brown eyes, Love--the\ndim reflection of that descending crown poised over her head--radiated\nin a faint lustre from her dark, thick hair. Around her beautiful neck,\nsloping to her shoulders with full, graceful curves, Love lay encircled\nlike a necklace--Love that was beyond words, sweet, breathed from\nher parted lips. From her white, large arms downward to her pink\nfinger-tips--Love, an invisible electric fluid, disengaged itself,\nsubtle, alluring. In the velvety huskiness of her voice, Love vibrated\nlike a note of unknown music.\n\nAnnixter, her uncouth, rugged husband, living in this influence of a\nwife, who was also a mother, at all hours touched to the quick by this\nsense of nobility, of gentleness and of love, the instincts of a father\nalready clutching and tugging at his heart, was trembling on the verge\nof a mighty transformation. The hardness and inhumanity of the man was\nfast breaking up. One night, returning late to the Ranch house, after\na compulsory visit to the city, he had come upon Hilma asleep. He had\nnever forgotten that night. A realization of his boundless happiness in\nthis love he gave and received, the thought that Hilma TRUSTED him, a\nknowledge of his own unworthiness, a vast and humble thankfulness that\nhis God had chosen him of all men for this great joy, had brought him\nto his knees for the first time in all his troubled, restless life\nof combat and aggression. He prayed, he knew not what,--vague words,\nwordless thoughts, resolving fiercely to do right, to make some return\nfor God's gift thus placed within his hands.\n\nWhere once Annixter had thought only of himself, he now thought only of\nHilma. The time when this thought of another should broaden and widen\ninto thought of OTHERS, was yet to come; but already it had expanded to\ninclude the unborn child--already, as in the case of Mrs. Dyke, it had\nbroadened to enfold another child and another mother bound to him by no\nties other than those of humanity and pity. In time, starting from this\npoint it would reach out more and more till it should take in all men\nand all women, and the intolerant selfish man, while retaining all\nof his native strength, should become tolerant and generous, kind and\nforgiving.\n\nFor the moment, however, the two natures struggled within him. A fight\nwas to be fought, one more, the last, the fiercest, the attack of the\nenemy who menaced his very home and hearth, was to be resisted. Then,\npeace attained, arrested development would once more proceed.\n\nHilma looked from the carry-all, scanning the open plain in front of the\nadvancing line of the drive.\n\n“Where are the rabbits?” she asked of Annixter. “I don't see any at\nall.”\n\n“They are way ahead of us yet,” he said. “Here, take the glasses.”\n\nHe passed her his field glasses, and she adjusted them.\n\n“Oh, yes,” she cried, “I see. I can see five or six, but oh, so far\noff.”\n\n“The beggars run 'way ahead, at first.”\n\n“I should say so. See them run,--little specks. Every now and then they\nsit up, their ears straight up, in the air.”\n\n“Here, look, Hilma, there goes one close by.”\n\nFrom out of the ground apparently, some twenty yards distant, a\ngreat jack sprang into view, bounding away with tremendous leaps, his\nblack-tipped ears erect. He disappeared, his grey body losing itself\nagainst the grey of the ground.\n\n“Oh, a big fellow.”\n\n“Hi, yonder's another.”\n\n“Yes, yes, oh, look at him run.” From off the surface of the ground,\nat first apparently empty of all life, and seemingly unable to afford\nhiding place for so much as a field-mouse, jack-rabbits started up at\nevery moment as the line went forward. At first, they appeared singly\nand at long intervals; then in twos and threes, as the drive continued\nto advance. They leaped across the plain, and stopped in the distance,\nsitting up with straight ears, then ran on again, were joined by others;\nsank down flush to the soil--their ears flattened; started up again,\nran to the side, turned back once more, darted away with incredible\nswiftness, and were lost to view only to be replaced by a score of\nothers.\n\nGradually, the number of jacks to be seen over the expanse of stubble in\nfront of the line of teams increased. Their antics were infinite. No two\nacted precisely alike. Some lay stubbornly close in a little depression\nbetween two clods, till the horses' hoofs were all but upon them,\nthen sprang out from their hiding-place at the last second. Others ran\nforward but a few yards at a time, refusing to take flight, scenting a\ngreater danger before them than behind. Still others, forced up at the\nlast moment, doubled with lightning alacrity in their tracks, turning\nback to scuttle between the teams, taking desperate chances. As often as\nthis occurred, it was the signal for a great uproar.\n\n“Don't let him get through; don t let him get through.”\n\n“Look out for him, there he goes.”\n\nHorns were blown, bells rung, tin pans clamorously beaten. Either the\njack escaped, or confused by the noise, darted back again, fleeing\naway as if his life depended on the issue of the instant. Once even, a\nbewildered rabbit jumped fair into Mrs. Derrick's lap as she sat in the\ncarry-all, and was out again like a flash.\n\n“Poor frightened thing,” she exclaimed; and for a long time afterward,\nshe retained upon her knees the sensation of the four little paws\nquivering with excitement, and the feel of the trembling furry body,\nwith its wildly beating heart, pressed against her own.\n\nBy noon the number of rabbits discernible by Annixter's field glasses\non ahead was far into the thousands. What seemed to be ground resolved\nitself, when seen through the glasses, into a maze of small, moving\nbodies, leaping, ducking, doubling, running back and forth--a wilderness\nof agitated ears, white tails and twinkling legs. The outside wings of\nthe curved line of vehicles began to draw in a little; Osterman's ranch\nwas left behind, the drive continued on over Quien Sabe.\n\nAs the day advanced, the rabbits, singularly enough, became less wild.\nWhen flushed, they no longer ran so far nor so fast, limping off instead\na few feet at a time, and crouching down, their ears close upon their\nbacks. Thus it was, that by degrees the teams began to close up on the\nmain herd. At every instant the numbers increased. It was no longer\nthousands, it was tens of thousands. The earth was alive with rabbits.\n\nDenser and denser grew the throng. In all directions nothing was to be\nseen but the loose mass of the moving jacks. The horns of the crescent\nof teams began to contract. Far off the corral came into sight. The\ndisintegrated mass of rabbits commenced, as it were, to solidify, to\ncoagulate. At first, each jack was some three feet distant from his\nnearest neighbor, but this space diminished to two feet, then to one,\nthen to but a few inches. The rabbits began leaping over one another.\n\nThen the strange scene defined itself. It was no longer a herd covering\nthe earth. It was a sea, whipped into confusion, tossing incessantly,\nleaping, falling, agitated by unseen forces. At times the unexpected\ntameness of the rabbits all at once vanished. Throughout certain\nportions of the herd eddies of terror abruptly burst forth. A panic\nspread; then there would ensue a blind, wild rushing together of\nthousands of crowded bodies, and a furious scrambling over backs,\ntill the scuffing thud of innumerable feet over the earth rose to a\nreverberating murmur as of distant thunder, here and there pierced by\nthe strange, wild cry of the rabbit in distress.\n\nThe line of vehicles was halted. To go forward now meant to trample\nthe rabbits under foot. The drive came to a standstill while the herd\nentered the corral. This took time, for the rabbits were by now too\ncrowded to run. However, like an opened sluice-gate, the extending\nflanks of the entrance of the corral slowly engulfed the herd. The mass,\npacked tight as ever, by degrees diminished, precisely as a pool of\nwater when a dam is opened. The last stragglers went in with a rush, and\nthe gate was dropped.\n\n“Come, just have a lock in here,” called Annixter.\n\nHilma, descending from the carry-all and joined by Presley and Harran,\napproached and looked over the high board fence.\n\n“Oh, did you ever see anything like that?” she exclaimed.\n\nThe corral, a really large enclosure, had proved all too small for\nthe number of rabbits collected by the drive. Inside it was a living,\nmoving, leaping, breathing, twisting mass. The rabbits were packed two,\nthree, and four feet deep. They were in constant movement; those beneath\nstruggling to the top, those on top sinking and disappearing below\ntheir fellows. All wildness, all fear of man, seemed to have entirely\ndisappeared. Men and boys reaching over the sides of the corral, picked\nup a jack in each hand, holding them by the ears, while two reporters\nfrom San Francisco papers took photographs of the scene. The noise made\nby the tens of thousands of moving bodies was as the noise of wind in a\nforest, while from the hot and sweating mass there rose a strange odor,\npenetrating, ammoniacal, savouring of wild life.\n\nOn signal, the killing began. Dogs that had been brought there for that\npurpose when let into the corral refused, as had been half expected,\nto do the work. They snuffed curiously at the pile, then backed off,\ndisturbed, perplexed. But the men and boys--Portuguese for the most\npart--were more eager. Annixter drew Hilma away, and, indeed, most of\nthe people set about the barbecue at once.\n\nIn the corral, however, the killing went forward. Armed with a club in\neach hand, the young fellows from Guadalajara and Bonneville, and the\nfarm boys from the ranches, leaped over the rails of the corral. They\nwalked unsteadily upon the myriad of crowding bodies underfoot, or, as\nspace was cleared, sank almost waist deep into the mass that leaped and\nsquirmed about them. Blindly, furiously, they struck and struck. The\nAnglo-Saxon spectators round about drew back in disgust, but the hot,\ndegenerated blood of Portuguese, Mexican, and mixed Spaniard boiled up\nin excitement at this wholesale slaughter.\n\nBut only a few of the participants of the drive cared to look on. All\nthe guests betook themselves some quarter of a mile farther on into the\nhills.\n\nThe picnic and barbecue were to be held around the spring where\nBroderson Creek took its rise. Already two entire beeves were roasting\nthere; teams were hitched, saddles removed, and men, women, and\nchildren, a great throng, spread out under the shade of the live oaks. A\nvast confused clamour rose in the air, a babel of talk, a clatter of\ntin plates, of knives and forks. Bottles were uncorked, napkins and\noil-cloths spread over the ground. The men lit pipes and cigars, the\nwomen seized the occasion to nurse their babies.\n\nOsterman, ubiquitous as ever, resplendent in his boots and English\nriding breeches, moved about between the groups, keeping up an endless\nflow of talk, cracking jokes, winking, nudging, gesturing, putting his\ntongue in his cheek, never at a loss for a reply, playing the goat.\n\n“That josher, Osterman, always at his monkey-shines, but a good fellow\nfor all that; brainy too. Nothing stuck up about him either, like Magnus\nDerrick.”\n\n“Everything all right, Buck?” inquired Osterman, coming up to where\nAnnixter, Hilma and Mrs. Derrick were sitting down to their lunch.\n\n“Yes, yes, everything right. But we've no cork-screw.”\n\n“No screw-cork--no scare-crow? Here you are,” and he drew from his\npocket a silver-plated jack-knife with a cork-screw attachment. Harran\nand Presley came up, bearing between them a great smoking, roasted\nportion of beef just off the fire. Hilma hastened to put forward a huge\nchina platter.\n\nOsterman had a joke to crack with the two boys, a joke that was rather\nbroad, but as he turned about, the words almost on his lips, his glance\nfell upon Hilma herself, whom he had not seen for more than two months.\n\nShe had handed Presley the platter, and was now sitting with her back\nagainst the tree, between two boles of the roots. The position was a\nlittle elevated and the supporting roots on either side of her were\nlike the arms of a great chair--a chair of state. She sat thus, as on\na throne, raised above the rest, the radiance of the unseen crown of\nmotherhood glowing from her forehead, the beauty of the perfect woman\nsurrounding her like a glory.\n\nAnd the josh died away on Osterman's lips, and unconsciously and swiftly\nhe bared his head. Something was passing there in the air about him that\nhe did not understand, something, however, that imposed reverence and\nprofound respect. For the first time in his life, embarrassment seized\nupon him, upon this joker, this wearer of clothes, this teller of funny\nstories, with his large, red ears, bald head and comic actor's face. He\nstammered confusedly and took himself away, for the moment abstracted,\nserious, lost in thought.\n\nBy now everyone was eating. It was the feeding of the People, elemental,\ngross, a great appeasing of appetite, an enormous quenching of thirst.\nQuarters of beef, roasts, ribs, shoulders, haunches were consumed,\nloaves of bread by the thousands disappeared, whole barrels of wine went\ndown the dry and dusty throats of the multitude. Conversation lagged\nwhile the People ate, while hunger was appeased. Everybody had their\nfill. One ate for the sake of eating, resolved that there should be\nnothing left, considering it a matter of pride to exhibit a clean plate.\n\nAfter dinner, preparations were made for games. On a flat plateau at the\ntop of one of the hills the contestants were to strive. There was to be\na footrace of young girls under seventeen, a fat men's race, the younger\nfellows were to put the shot, to compete in the running broad jump, and\nthe standing high jump, in the hop, skip, and step and in wrestling.\n\nPresley was delighted with it all. It was Homeric, this feasting, this\nvast consuming of meat and bread and wine, followed now by games of\nstrength. An epic simplicity and directness, an honest Anglo-Saxon mirth\nand innocence, commended it. Crude it was; coarse it was, but no\ntaint of viciousness was here. These people were good people, kindly,\nbenignant even, always readier to give than to receive, always more\nwilling to help than to be helped. They were good stock. Of such was the\nbackbone of the nation--sturdy Americans everyone of them. Where else\nin the world round were such strong, honest men, such strong, beautiful\nwomen?\n\nAnnixter, Harran, and Presley climbed to the level plateau where the\ngames were to be held, to lay out the courses, and mark the distances.\nIt was the very place where once Presley had loved to lounge entire\nafternoons, reading his books of poems, smoking and dozing. From this\nhigh point one dominated the entire valley to the south and west. The\nview was superb. The three men paused for a moment on the crest of the\nhill to consider it.\n\nYoung Vacca came running and panting up the hill after them, calling for\nAnnixter.\n\n“Well, well, what is it?”\n\n“Mr. Osterman's looking for you, sir, you and Mr. Harran. Vanamee,\nthat cow-boy over at Derrick's, has just come from the Governor with a\nmessage. I guess it's important.”\n\n“Hello, what's up now?” muttered Annixter, as they turned back.\n\nThey found Osterman saddling his horse in furious haste. Near-by him was\nVanamee holding by the bridle an animal that was one lather of sweat.\nA few of the picnickers were turning their heads curiously in that\ndirection. Evidently something of moment was in the wind.\n\n“What's all up?” demanded Annixter, as he and Harran, followed by\nPresley, drew near.\n\n“There's hell to pay,” exclaimed Osterman under his breath. “Read that.\nVanamee just brought it.”\n\nHe handed Annixter a sheet of note paper, and turned again to the\ncinching of his saddle.\n\n“We've got to be quick,” he cried. “They've stolen a march on us.”\n\nAnnixter read the note, Harran and Presley looking over his shoulder.\n\n“Ah, it's them, is it,” exclaimed Annixter.\n\nHarran set his teeth. “Now for it,” he exclaimed. “They've been to your\nplace already, Mr. Annixter,” said Vanamee. “I passed by it on my way\nup. They have put Delaney in possession, and have set all your furniture\nout in the road.”\n\nAnnixter turned about, his lips white. Already Presley and Harran had\nrun to their horses.\n\n“Vacca,” cried Annixter, “where's Vacca? Put the saddle on the buckskin,\nQUICK. Osterman, get as many of the League as are here together at THIS\nspot, understand. I'll be back in a minute. I must tell Hilma this.”\n\nHooven ran up as Annixter disappeared. His little eyes were blazing, he\nwas dragging his horse with him.\n\n“Say, dose fellers come, hey? Me, I'm alretty, see I hev der guhn.”\n\n“They've jumped the ranch, little girl,” said Annixter, putting one arm\naround Hilma. “They're in our house now. I'm off. Go to Derrick's and\nwait for me there.”\n\nShe put her arms around his neck.\n\n“You're going?” she demanded.\n\n“I must. Don't be frightened. It will be all right. Go to Derrick's\nand--good-bye.”\n\nShe said never a word. She looked once long into his eyes, then kissed\nhim on the mouth.\n\nMeanwhile, the news had spread. The multitude rose to its feet. Women\nand men, with pale faces, looked at each other speechless, or broke\nforth into inarticulate exclamations. A strange, unfamiliar murmur took\nthe place of the tumultuous gaiety of the previous moments. A sense of\ndread, of confusion, of impending terror weighed heavily in the air.\nWhat was now to happen?\n\nWhen Annixter got back to Osterman, he found a number of the Leaguers\nalready assembled. They were all mounted. Hooven was there and Harran,\nand besides these, Garnett of the Ruby ranch and Gethings of the San\nPablo, Phelps the foreman of Los Muertos, and, last of all, Dabney,\nsilent as ever, speaking to no one. Presley came riding up.\n\n“Best keep out of this, Pres,” cried Annixter.\n\n“Are we ready?” exclaimed Gethings.\n\n“Ready, ready, we're all here.”\n\n“ALL. Is this all of us?” cried Annixter. “Where are the six hundred men\nwho were going to rise when this happened?”\n\nThey had wavered, these other Leaguers. Now, when the actual crisis\nimpended, they were smitten with confusion. Ah, no, they were not going\nto stand up and be shot at just to save Derrick's land. They were\nnot armed. What did Annixter and Osterman take them for? No, sir; the\nRailroad had stolen a march on them. After all his big talk Derrick had\nallowed them to be taken by surprise. The only thing to do was to call\na meeting of the Executive Committee. That was the only thing. As for\ngoing down there with no weapons in their hands, NO, sir. That was\nasking a little TOO much. “Come on, then, boys,” shouted Osterman,\nturning his back on the others. “The Governor says to meet him at\nHooven's. We'll make for the Long Trestle and strike the trail to\nHooven's there.”\n\nThey set off. It was a terrible ride. Twice during the scrambling\ndescent from the hills, Presley's pony fell beneath him. Annixter, on\nhis buckskin, and Osterman, on his thoroughbred, good horsemen both,\nled the others, setting a terrific pace. The hills were left behind.\nBroderson Creek was crossed and on the levels of Quien Sabe, straight\nthrough the standing wheat, the nine horses, flogged and spurred,\nstretched out to their utmost. Their passage through the wheat sounded\nlike the rip and tear of a gigantic web of cloth. The landscape on\neither hand resolved itself into a long blur. Tears came to the eyes,\nflying pebbles, clods of earth, grains of wheat flung up in the flight,\nstung the face like shot. Osterman's thoroughbred took the second\ncrossing of Broderson's Creek in a single leap. Down under the Long\nTrestle tore the cavalcade in a shower of mud and gravel; up again on\nthe further bank, the horses blowing like steam engines; on into the\ntrail to Hooven's, single file now, Presley's pony lagging, Hooven's\nhorse bleeding at the eyes, the buckskin, game as a fighting cock,\ncatching her second wind, far in the lead now, distancing even the\nEnglish thoroughbred that Osterman rode.\n\nAt last Hooven's unpainted house, beneath the enormous live oak tree,\ncame in sight. Across the Lower Road, breaking through fences and into\nthe yard around the house, thundered the Leaguers. Magnus was waiting\nfor them.\n\nThe riders dismounted, hardly less exhausted than their horses.\n\n“Why, where's all the men?” Annixter demanded of Magnus.\n\n“Broderson is here and Cutter,” replied the Governor, “no one else. I\nthought YOU would bring more men with you.”\n\n“There are only nine of us.”\n\n“And the six hundred Leaguers who were going to rise when this\nhappened!” exclaimed Garnett, bitterly.\n\n“Rot the League,” cried Annixter. “It's gone to pot--went to pieces at\nthe first touch.”\n\n“We have been taken by surprise, gentlemen, after all,” said Magnus.\n“Totally off our guard. But there are eleven of us. It is enough.”\n\n“Well, what's the game? Has the marshal come? How many men are with\nhim?”\n\n“The United States marshal from San Francisco,” explained Magnus, “came\ndown early this morning and stopped at Guadalajara. We learned it all\nthrough our friends in Bonneville about an hour ago. They telephoned\nme and Mr. Broderson. S. Behrman met him and provided about a dozen\ndeputies. Delaney, Ruggles, and Christian joined them at Guadalajara.\nThey left Guadalajara, going towards Mr. Annixter's ranch house on Quien\nSabe. They are serving the writs in ejectment and putting the dummy\nbuyers in possession. They are armed. S. Behrman is with them.”\n\n“Where are they now?”\n\n“Cutter is watching them from the Long Trestle. They returned to\nGuadalajara. They are there now.”\n\n“Well,” observed Gethings, “From Guadalajara they can only go to two\nplaces. Either they will take the Upper Road and go on to Osterman's\nnext, or they will take the Lower Road to Mr. Derrick's.”\n\n“That is as I supposed,” said Magnus. “That is why I wanted you to come\nhere. From Hooven's, here, we can watch both roads simultaneously.”\n\n“Is anybody on the lookout on the Upper Road?”\n\n“Cutter. He is on the Long Trestle.”\n\n“Say,” observed Hooven, the instincts of the old-time soldier stirring\nhim, “say, dose feller pretty demn schmart, I tink. We got to put some\npicket way oudt bei der Lower Roadt alzoh, und he tek dose glassus\nMist'r Ennixt'r got bei um. Say, look at dose irregation ditsch.\nDot ditsch he run righd across BOTH dose road, hey? Dat's some fine\nentrenchment, you bedt. We fighd um from dose ditsch.”\n\nIn fact, the dry irrigating ditch was a natural trench, admirably suited\nto the purpose, crossing both roads as Hooven pointed out and barring\napproach from Guadalajara to all the ranches save Annixter's--which had\nalready been seized.\n\nGethings departed to join Cutter on the Long Trestle, while Phelps and\nHarran, taking Annixter's field glasses with them, and mounting their\nhorses, went out towards Guadalajara on the Lower Road to watch for the\nmarshal's approach from that direction.\n\nAfter the outposts had left them, the party in Hooven's cottage looked\nto their weapons. Long since, every member of the League had been in\nthe habit of carrying his revolver with him. They were all armed and, in\naddition, Hooven had his rifle. Presley alone carried no weapon.\n\nThe main room of Hooven's house, in which the Leaguers were now\nassembled, was barren, poverty-stricken, but tolerably clean. An old\nclock ticked vociferously on a shelf. In one corner was a bed, with a\npatched, faded quilt. In the centre of the room, straddling over the\nbare floor, stood a pine table. Around this the men gathered, two or\nthree occupying chairs, Annixter sitting sideways on the table, the rest\nstanding.\n\n“I believe, gentlemen,” said Magnus, “that we can go through this day\nwithout bloodshed. I believe not one shot need be fired. The Railroad\nwill not force the issue, will not bring about actual fighting. When\nthe marshal realises that we are thoroughly in earnest, thoroughly\ndetermined, I am convinced that he will withdraw.”\n\nThere were murmurs of assent.\n\n“Look here,” said Annixter, “if this thing can by any means be settled\npeaceably, I say let's do it, so long as we don't give in.”\n\nThe others stared. Was this Annixter who spoke--the Hotspur of the\nLeague, the quarrelsome, irascible fellow who loved and sought a\nquarrel? Was it Annixter, who now had been the first and only one\nof them all to suffer, whose ranch had been seized, whose household\npossessions had been flung out into the road?\n\n“When you come right down to it,” he continued, “killing a man, no\nmatter what he's done to you, is a serious business. I propose we make\none more attempt to stave this thing off. Let's see if we can't get to\ntalk with the marshal himself; at any rate, warn him of the danger of\ngoing any further. Boys, let's not fire the first shot. What do you\nsay?”\n\nThe others agreed unanimously and promptly; and old Broderson, tugging\nuneasily at his long beard, added:\n\n“No--no--no violence, no UNNECESSARY violence, that is. I should hate\nto have innocent blood on my hands--that is, if it IS innocent. I don't\nknow, that S. Behrman--ah, he is a--a--surely he had innocent blood on\nHIS head. That Dyke affair, terrible, terrible; but then Dyke WAS in the\nwrong--driven to it, though; the Railroad did drive him to it. I want to\nbe fair and just to everybody.”\n\n“There's a team coming up the road from Los Muertos,” announced Presley\nfrom the door.\n\n“Fair and just to everybody,” murmured old Broderson, wagging his head,\nfrowning perplexedly. “I don't want to--to--to harm anybody unless they\nharm me.”\n\n“Is the team going towards Guadalajara?” enquired Garnett, getting up\nand coming to the door.\n\n“Yes, it's a Portuguese, one of the garden truck men.”\n\n“We must turn him back,” declared Osterman. “He can't go through here.\nWe don't want him to take any news on to the marshal and S. Behrman.”\n\n“I'll turn him back,” said Presley.\n\nHe rode out towards the market cart, and the others, watching from\nthe road in front of Hooven's, saw him halt it. An excited interview\nfollowed. They could hear the Portuguese expostulating volubly, but in\nthe end he turned back.\n\n“Martial law on Los Muertos, isn't it?” observed Osterman. “Steady all,”\n he exclaimed as he turned about, “here comes Harran.”\n\nHarran rode up at a gallop. The others surrounded him.\n\n“I saw them,” he cried. “They are coming this way. S. Behrman and\nRuggles are in a two-horse buggy. All the others are on horseback. There\nare eleven of them. Christian and Delaney are with them. Those two have\nrifles. I left Hooven watching them.”\n\n“Better call in Gethings and Cutter right away,” said Annixter. “We'll\nneed all our men.”\n\n“I'll call them in,” Presley volunteered at once. “Can I have the\nbuckskin? My pony is about done up.”\n\nHe departed at a brisk gallop, but on the way met Gethings and Cutter\nreturning. They, too, from their elevated position, had observed the\nmarshal's party leaving Guadalajara by the Lower Road. Presley told them\nof the decision of the Leaguers not to fire until fired upon.\n\n“All right,” said Gethings. “But if it comes to a gun-fight, that means\nit's all up with at least one of us. Delaney never misses his man.”\n\nWhen they reached Hooven's again, they found that the Leaguers had\nalready taken their position in the ditch. The plank bridge across it\nhad been torn up. Magnus, two long revolvers lying on the embankment\nin front of him, was in the middle, Harran at his side. On either side,\nsome five feet intervening between each man, stood the other Leaguers,\ntheir revolvers ready. Dabney, the silent old man, had taken off his\ncoat.\n\n“Take your places between Mr. Osterman and Mr. Broderson,” said Magnus,\nas the three men rode up. “Presley,” he added, “I forbid you to take any\npart in this affair.”\n\n“Yes, keep him out of it,” cried Annixter from his position at the\nextreme end of the line. “Go back to Hooven's house, Pres, and look\nafter the horses,” he added. “This is no business of yours. And keep\nthe road behind us clear. Don't let ANY ONE come near, not ANY ONE,\nunderstand?”\n\nPresley withdrew, leading the buckskin and the horses that Gethings and\nCutter had ridden. He fastened them under the great live oak and then\ncame out and stood in the road in front of the house to watch what was\ngoing on.\n\nIn the ditch, shoulder deep, the Leaguers, ready, watchful, waited in\nsilence, their eyes fixed on the white shimmer of the road leading to\nGuadalajara.\n\n“Where's Hooven?” enquired Cutter.\n\n“I don't know,” Osterman replied. “He was out watching the Lower Road\nwith Harran Derrick. Oh, Harran,” he called, “isn't Hooven coming in?”\n\n“I don't know what he is waiting for,” answered Harran. “He was to have\ncome in just after me. He thought maybe the marshal's party might make a\nfeint in this direction, then go around by the Upper Road, after all. He\nwanted to watch them a little longer. But he ought to be here now.”\n\n“Think he'll take a shot at them on his own account?”\n\n“Oh, no, he wouldn't do that.”\n\n“Maybe they took him prisoner.”\n\n“Well, that's to be thought of, too.”\n\nSuddenly there was a cry. Around the bend of the road in front of them\ncame a cloud of dust. From it emerged a horse's head.\n\n“Hello, hello, there's something.”\n\n“Remember, we are not to fire first.”\n\n“Perhaps that's Hooven; I can't see. Is it? There only seems to be one\nhorse.”\n\n“Too much dust for one horse.”\n\nAnnixter, who had taken his field glasses from Harran, adjusted them to\nhis eyes.\n\n“That's not them,” he announced presently, “nor Hooven either. That's\na cart.” Then after another moment, he added, “The butcher's cart from\nGuadalajara.”\n\nThe tension was relaxed. The men drew long breaths, settling back in\ntheir places.\n\n“Do we let him go on, Governor?”\n\n“The bridge is down. He can't go by and we must not let him go back. We\nshall have to detain him and question him. I wonder the marshal let him\npass.”\n\nThe cart approached at a lively trot.\n\n“Anybody else in that cart, Mr. Annixter?” asked Magnus. “Look\ncarefully. It may be a ruse. It is strange the marshal should have let\nhim pass.”\n\nThe Leaguers roused themselves again. Osterman laid his hand on his\nrevolver.\n\n“No,” called Annixter, in another instant, “no, there's only one man in\nit.”\n\nThe cart came up, and Cutter and Phelps, clambering from the ditch,\nstopped it as it arrived in front of the party.\n\n“Hey--what--what?” exclaimed the young butcher, pulling up. “Is that\nbridge broke?”\n\nBut at the idea of being held, the boy protested at top voice, badly\nfrightened, bewildered, not knowing what was to happen next.\n\n“No, no, I got my meat to deliver. Say, you let me go. Say, I ain't got\nnothing to do with you.”\n\nHe tugged at the reins, trying to turn the cart about. Cutter, with his\njack-knife, parted the reins just back of the bit.\n\n“You'll stay where you are, m' son, for a while. We're not going to hurt\nyou. But you are not going back to town till we say so. Did you pass\nanybody on the road out of town?”\n\nIn reply to the Leaguers' questions, the young butcher at last told\nthem he had passed a two-horse buggy and a lot of men on horseback just\nbeyond the railroad tracks. They were headed for Los Muertos.\n\n“That's them, all right,” muttered Annixter. “They're coming by this\nroad, sure.”\n\nThe butcher's horse and cart were led to one side of the road, and the\nhorse tied to the fence with one of the severed lines. The butcher,\nhimself, was passed over to Presley, who locked him in Hooven's barn.\n\n“Well, what the devil,” demanded Osterman, “has become of Bismarck?”\n\nIn fact, the butcher had seen nothing of Hooven. The minutes were\npassing, and still he failed to appear.\n\n“What's he up to, anyways?”\n\n“Bet you what you like, they caught him. Just like that crazy Dutchman\nto get excited and go too near. You can always depend on Hooven to lose\nhis head.”\n\nFive minutes passed, then ten. The road towards Guadalajara lay empty,\nbaking and white under the sun.\n\n“Well, the marshal and S. Behrman don't seem to be in any hurry,\neither.”\n\n“Shall I go forward and reconnoitre, Governor?” asked Harran.\n\nBut Dabney, who stood next to Annixter, touched him on the shoulder and,\nwithout speaking, pointed down the road. Annixter looked, then suddenly\ncried out:\n\n“Here comes Hooven.”\n\nThe German galloped into sight, around the turn of the road, his rifle\nlaid across his saddle. He came on rapidly, pulled up, and dismounted at\nthe ditch.\n\n“Dey're commen,” he cried, trembling with excitement. “I watch um long\ndime bei der side oaf der roadt in der busches. Dey shtop bei der gate\noder side der relroadt trecks and talk long dime mit one n'udder. Den\ndey gome on. Dey're gowun sure do zum monkey-doodle pizeness. Me, I see\nGritschun put der kertridges in his guhn. I tink dey gowun to gome MY\nblace first. Dey gowun to try put me off, tek my home, bei Gott.”\n\n“All right, get down in here and keep quiet, Hooven. Don't fire\nunless----”\n\n“Here they are.”\n\nA half-dozen voices uttered the cry at once.\n\nThere could be no mistake this time. A buggy, drawn by two horses, came\ninto view around the curve of the road. Three riders accompanied it,\nand behind these, seen at intervals in a cloud of dust were\ntwo--three--five--six others.\n\nThis, then, was S. Behrman with the United States marshal and his posse.\nThe event that had been so long in preparation, the event which it had\nbeen said would never come to pass, the last trial of strength, the last\nfight between the Trust and the People, the direct, brutal grapple of\narmed men, the law defied, the Government ignored, behold, here it was\nclose at hand.\n\nOsterman cocked his revolver, and in the profound silence that had\nfallen upon the scene, the click was plainly audible from end to end of\nthe line.\n\n“Remember our agreement, gentlemen,” cried Magnus, in a warning voice.\n“Mr. Osterman, I must ask you to let down the hammer of your weapon.”\n\nNo one answered. In absolute quiet, standing motionless in their places,\nthe Leaguers watched the approach of the marshal.\n\nFive minutes passed. The riders came on steadily. They drew nearer.\nThe grind of the buggy wheels in the grit and dust of the road, and the\nprolonged clatter of the horses' feet began to make itself heard. The\nLeaguers could distinguish the faces of their enemies.\n\nIn the buggy were S. Behrman and Cyrus Ruggles, the latter driving.\nA tall man in a frock coat and slouched hat--the marshal, beyond\nquestion--rode at the left of the buggy; Delaney, carrying a Winchester,\nat the right. Christian, the real estate broker, S. Behrman's cousin,\nalso with a rifle, could be made out just behind the marshal. Back of\nthese, riding well up, was a group of horsemen, indistinguishable in the\ndust raised by the buggy's wheels.\n\nSteadily the distance between the Leaguers and the posse diminished.\n\n“Don't let them get too close, Governor,” whispered Harran.\n\nWhen S. Behrman's buggy was about one hundred yards distant from the\nirrigating ditch, Magnus sprang out upon the road, leaving his revolvers\nbehind him. He beckoned Garnett and Gethings to follow, and the three\nranchers, who, with the exception of Broderson, were the oldest men\npresent, advanced, without arms, to meet the marshal.\n\nMagnus cried aloud:\n\n“Halt where you are.”\n\nFrom their places in the ditch, Annixter, Osterman, Dabney, Harran,\nHooven, Broderson, Cutter, and Phelps, their hands laid upon their\nrevolvers, watched silently, alert, keen, ready for anything.\n\nAt the Governor's words, they saw Ruggles pull sharply on the reins. The\nbuggy came to a standstill, the riders doing likewise. Magnus approached\nthe marshal, still followed by Garnett and Gethings, and began to speak.\nHis voice was audible to the men in the ditch, but his words could not\nbe made out. They heard the marshal reply quietly enough and the two\nshook hands. Delaney came around from the side of the buggy, his horse\nstanding before the team across the road. He leaned from the saddle,\nlistening to what was being said, but made no remark. From time to time,\nS. Behrman and Ruggles, from their seats in the buggy, interposed a\nsentence or two into the conversation, but at first, so far as the\nLeaguers could discern, neither Magnus nor the marshal paid them any\nattention. They saw, however, that the latter repeatedly shook his head\nand once they heard him exclaim in a loud voice:\n\n“I only know my duty, Mr. Derrick.”\n\nThen Gethings turned about, and seeing Delaney close at hand, addressed\nan unheard remark to him. The cow-puncher replied curtly and the words\nseemed to anger Gethings. He made a gesture, pointing back to the\nditch, showing the intrenched Leaguers to the posse. Delaney appeared\nto communicate the news that the Leaguers were on hand and prepared to\nresist, to the other members of the party. They all looked toward the\nditch and plainly saw the ranchers there, standing to their arms.\n\nBut meanwhile Ruggles had addressed himself more directly to Magnus, and\nbetween the two an angry discussion was going forward. Once even Harran\nheard his father exclaim:\n\n“The statement is a lie and no one knows it better than yourself.”\n\n“Here,” growled Annixter to Dabney, who stood next him in the ditch,\n“those fellows are getting too close. Look at them edging up. Don't\nMagnus see that?”\n\nThe other members of the marshal's force had come forward from their\nplaces behind the buggy and were spread out across the road. Some of\nthem were gathered about Magnus, Garnett, and Gethings; and some were\ntalking together, looking and pointing towards the ditch. Whether acting\nupon signal or not, the Leaguers in the ditch could not tell, but it\nwas certain that one or two of the posse had moved considerably forward.\nBesides this, Delaney had now placed his horse between Magnus and the\nditch, and two others riding up from the rear had followed his example.\nThe posse surrounded the three ranchers, and by now, everybody was\ntalking at once.\n\n“Look here,” Harran called to Annixter, “this won't do. I don't like the\nlooks of this thing. They all seem to be edging up, and before we know\nit they may take the Governor and the other men prisoners.”\n\n“They ought to come back,” declared Annixter.\n\n“Somebody ought to tell them that those fellows are creeping up.”\n\nBy now, the angry argument between the Governor and Ruggles had become\nmore heated than ever. Their voices were raised; now and then they made\nfurious gestures.\n\n“They ought to come back,” cried Osterman. “We couldn't shoot now if\nanything should happen, for fear of hitting them.”\n\n“Well, it sounds as though something were going to happen pretty soon.”\n\nThey could hear Gethings and Delaney wrangling furiously; another deputy\njoined in.\n\n“I'm going to call the Governor back,” exclaimed Annixter, suddenly\nclambering out of the ditch. “No, no,” cried Osterman, “keep in the\nditch. They can't drive us out if we keep here.”\n\nHooven and Harran, who had instinctively followed Annixter, hesitated\nat Osterman's words and the three halted irresolutely on the road before\nthe ditch, their weapons in their hands.\n\n“Governor,” shouted Harran, “come on back. You can't do anything.”\n\nStill the wrangle continued, and one of the deputies, advancing a little\nfrom out the group, cried out:\n\n“Keep back there! Keep back there, you!”\n\n“Go to hell, will you?” shouted Harran on the instant. “You're on my\nland.”\n\n“Oh, come back here, Harran,” called Osterman. “That ain't going to do\nany good.”\n\n“There--listen,” suddenly exclaimed Harran. “The Governor is calling us.\nCome on; I'm going.”\n\nOsterman got out of the ditch and came forward, catching Harran by the\narm and pulling him back.\n\n“He didn't call. Don't get excited. You'll ruin everything. Get back\ninto the ditch again.”\n\nBut Cutter, Phelps, and the old man Dabney, misunderstanding what\nwas happening, and seeing Osterman leave the ditch, had followed his\nexample. All the Leaguers were now out of the ditch, and a little way\ndown the road, Hooven, Osterman, Annixter, and Harran in front, Dabney,\nPhelps, and Cutter coming up from behind.\n\n“Keep back, you,” cried the deputy again.\n\nIn the group around S. Behrman's buggy, Gethings and Delaney were yet\nquarrelling, and the angry debate between Magnus, Garnett, and the\nmarshal still continued.\n\nTill this moment, the real estate broker, Christian, had taken no part\nin the argument, but had kept himself in the rear of the buggy. Now,\nhowever, he pushed forward. There was but little room for him to pass,\nand, as he rode by the buggy, his horse scraped his flank against the\nhub of the wheel. The animal recoiled sharply, and, striking against\nGarnett, threw him to the ground. Delaney's horse stood between the\nbuggy and the Leaguers gathered on the road in front of the ditch; the\nincident, indistinctly seen by them, was misinterpreted.\n\nGarnett had not yet risen when Hooven raised a great shout:\n\n“HOCH, DER KAISER! HOCH, DER VATERLAND!”\n\nWith the words, he dropped to one knee, and sighting his rifle\ncarefully, fired into the group of men around the buggy.\n\nInstantly the revolvers and rifles seemed to go off of themselves. Both\nsides, deputies and Leaguers, opened fire simultaneously. At first, it\nwas nothing but a confused roar of explosions; then the roar lapsed to\nan irregular, quick succession of reports, shot leaping after shot;\nthen a moment's silence, and, last of all, regular as clock-ticks, three\nshots at exact intervals. Then stillness.\n\nDelaney, shot through the stomach, slid down from his horse, and, on\nhis hands and knees, crawled from the road into the standing wheat.\nChristian fell backward from the saddle toward the buggy, and hung\nsuspended in that position, his head and shoulders on the wheel, one\nstiff leg still across his saddle. Hooven, in attempting to rise from\nhis kneeling position, received a rifle ball squarely in the throat, and\nrolled forward upon his face. Old Broderson, crying out, “Oh, they've\nshot me, boys,” staggered sideways, his head bent, his hands rigid at\nhis sides, and fell into the ditch. Osterman, blood running from his\nmouth and nose, turned about and walked back. Presley helped him across\nthe irrigating ditch and Osterman laid himself down, his head on his\nfolded arms. Harran Derrick dropped where he stood, turning over on his\nface, and lay motionless, groaning terribly, a pool of blood forming\nunder his stomach. The old man Dabney, silent as ever, received his\ndeath, speechless. He fell to his knees, got up again, fell once more,\nand died without a word. Annixter, instantly killed, fell his length\nto the ground, and lay without movement, just as he had fallen, one arm\nacross his face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nOn their way to Derrick's ranch house, Hilma and Mrs. Derrick heard the\nsounds of distant firing.\n\n“Stop!” cried Hilma, laying her hand upon young Vacca's arm. “Stop the\nhorses. Listen, what was that?”\n\nThe carry-all came to a halt and from far away across the rustling wheat\ncame the faint rattle of rifles and revolvers.\n\n“Say,” cried Vacca, rolling his eyes, “oh, say, they're fighting over\nthere.”\n\nMrs. Derrick put her hands over her face.\n\n“Fighting,” she cried, “oh, oh, it's terrible. Magnus is there--and\nHarran.”\n\n“Where do you think it is?” demanded Hilma. “That's over toward\nHooven's.”\n\n“I'm going. Turn back. Drive to Hooven's, quick.”\n\n“Better not, Mrs. Annixter,” protested the young man. “Mr. Annixter said\nwe were to go to Derrick's. Better keep away from Hooven's if there's\ntrouble there. We wouldn't get there till it's all over, anyhow.”\n\n“Yes, yes, let's go home,” cried Mrs. Derrick, “I'm afraid. Oh, Hilma,\nI'm afraid.”\n\n“Come with me to Hooven's then.”\n\n“There, where they are fighting? Oh, I couldn't. I--I can't. It would be\nall over before we got there as Vacca says.”\n\n“Sure,” repeated young Vacca.\n\n“Drive to Hooven's,” commanded Hilma. “If you won't, I'll walk there.”\n She threw off the lap-robes, preparing to descend. “And you,” she\nexclaimed, turning to Mrs. Derrick, “how CAN you--when Harran and your\nhusband may be--may--are in danger.”\n\nGrumbling, Vacca turned the carry-all about and drove across the open\nfields till he reached the road to Guadalajara, just below the Mission.\n\n“Hurry!” cried Hilma.\n\nThe horses started forward under the touch of the whip. The ranch houses\nof Quien Sabe came in sight.\n\n“Do you want to stop at the house?” inquired Vacca over his shoulder.\n\n“No, no; oh, go faster--make the horses run.”\n\nThey dashed through the houses of the Home ranch.\n\n“Oh, oh,” cried Hilma suddenly, “look, look there. Look what they have\ndone.”\n\nVacca pulled the horses up, for the road in front of Annixter's house\nwas blocked.\n\nA vast, confused heap of household effects was there--chairs, sofas,\npictures, fixtures, lamps. Hilma's little home had been gutted;\neverything had been taken from it and ruthlessly flung out upon the\nroad, everything that she and her husband had bought during that\nwonderful week after their marriage. Here was the white enamelled “set”\n of the bedroom furniture, the three chairs, wash-stand and bureau,--the\nbureau drawers falling out, spilling their contents into the dust; there\nwere the white wool rugs of the sitting-room, the flower stand, with its\npots all broken, its flowers wilting; the cracked goldfish globe, the\nfishes already dead; the rocking chair, the sewing machine, the great\nround table of yellow oak, the lamp with its deep shade of crinkly\nred tissue paper, the pretty tinted photographs that had hung on the\nwall--the choir boys with beautiful eyes, the pensive young girls in\npink gowns--the pieces of wood carving that represented quails and\nducks, and, last of all, its curtains of crisp, clean muslin, cruelly\ntorn and crushed--the bed, the wonderful canopied bed so brave and gay,\nof which Hilma had been so proud, thrust out there into the common road,\ntorn from its place, from the discreet intimacy of her bridal chamber,\nviolated, profaned, flung out into the dust and garish sunshine for all\nmen to stare at, a mockery and a shame.\n\nTo Hilma it was as though something of herself, of her person, had been\nthus exposed and degraded; all that she held sacred pilloried, gibbeted,\nand exhibited to the world's derision. Tears of anguish sprang to her\neyes, a red flame of outraged modesty overspread her face.\n\n“Oh,” she cried, a sob catching her throat, “oh, how could they do it?”\n But other fears intruded; other greater terrors impended.\n\n“Go on,” she cried to Vacca, “go on quickly.”\n\nBut Vacca would go no further. He had seen what had escaped Hilma's\nattention, two men, deputies, no doubt, on the porch of the ranch house.\nThey held possession there, and the evidence of the presence of the\nenemy in this raid upon Quien Sabe had daunted him.\n\n“No, SIR,” he declared, getting out of the carry-all, “I ain't going to\ntake you anywhere where you're liable to get hurt. Besides, the road's\nblocked by all this stuff. You can't get the team by.”\n\nHilma sprang from the carry-all.\n\n“Come,” she said to Mrs. Derrick.\n\nThe older woman, trembling, hesitating, faint with dread, obeyed, and\nHilma, picking her way through and around the wreck of her home, set off\nby the trail towards the Long Trestle and Hooven's.\n\nWhen she arrived, she found the road in front of the German's house,\nand, indeed, all the surrounding yard, crowded with people. An\noverturned buggy lay on the side of the road in the distance, its horses\nin a tangle of harness, held by two or three men. She saw Caraher's\nbuckboard under the live oak and near it a second buggy which she\nrecognised as belonging to a doctor in Guadalajara.\n\n“Oh, what has happened; oh, what has happened?” moaned Mrs. Derrick.\n\n“Come,” repeated Hilma. The young girl took her by the hand and together\nthey pushed their way through the crowd of men and women and entered the\nyard.\n\nThe throng gave way before the two women, parting to right and left\nwithout a word.\n\n“Presley,” cried Mrs. Derrick, as she caught sight of him in the doorway\nof the house, “oh, Presley, what has happened? Is Harran safe? Is Magnus\nsafe? Where are they?”\n\n“Don't go in, Mrs. Derrick,” said Presley, coming forward, “don't go\nin.”\n\n“Where is my husband?” demanded Hilma.\n\nPresley turned away and steadied himself against the jamb of the door.\n\nHilma, leaving Mrs. Derrick, entered the house. The front room was full\nof men. She was dimly conscious of Cyrus Ruggles and S. Behrman, both\ndeadly pale, talking earnestly and in whispers to Cutter and Phelps.\nThere was a strange, acrid odour of an unfamiliar drug in the air.\nOn the table before her was a satchel, surgical instruments, rolls of\nbandages, and a blue, oblong paper box full of cotton. But above the\nhushed noises of voices and footsteps, one terrible sound made itself\nheard--the prolonged, rasping sound of breathing, half choked, laboured,\nagonised.\n\n“Where is my husband?” she cried. She pushed the men aside. She saw\nMagnus, bareheaded, three or four men lying on the floor, one half\nnaked, his body swathed in white bandages; the doctor in shirt sleeves,\non one knee beside a figure of a man stretched out beside him.\n\nGarnett turned a white face to her.\n\n“Where is my husband?”\n\nThe other did not reply, but stepped aside and Hilma saw the dead body\nof her husband lying upon the bed. She did not cry out. She said no\nword. She went to the bed, and sitting upon it, took Annixter's head\nin her lap, holding it gently between her hands. Thereafter she did\nnot move, but sat holding her dead husband's head in her lap, looking\nvaguely about from face to face of those in the room, while, without\na sob, without a cry, the great tears filled her wide-opened eyes and\nrolled slowly down upon her cheeks.\n\nOn hearing that his wife was outside, Magnus came quickly forward. She\nthrew herself into his arms.\n\n“Tell me, tell me,” she cried, “is Harran--is----”\n\n“We don't know yet,” he answered. “Oh, Annie----”\n\nThen suddenly the Governor checked himself. He, the indomitable, could\nnot break down now.\n\n“The doctor is with him,” he said; “we are doing all we can. Try and be\nbrave, Annie. There is always hope. This is a terrible day's work. God\nforgive us all.”\n\nShe pressed forward, but he held her back.\n\n“No, don't see him now. Go into the next room. Garnett, take care of\nher.”\n\nBut she would not be denied. She pushed by Magnus, and, breaking\nthrough the group that surrounded her son, sank on her knees beside him,\nmoaning, in compassion and terror.\n\nHarran lay straight and rigid upon the floor, his head propped by a\npillow, his coat that had been taken off spread over his chest. One leg\nof his trousers was soaked through and through with blood. His eyes were\nhalf-closed, and with the regularity of a machine, the eyeballs twitched\nand twitched. His face was so white that it made his yellow hair look\nbrown, while from his opened mouth, there issued that loud and terrible\nsound of guttering, rasping, laboured breathing that gagged and choked\nand gurgled with every inhalation.\n\n“Oh, Harrie, Harrie,” called Mrs. Derrick, catching at one of his hands.\n\nThe doctor shook his head.\n\n“He is unconscious, Mrs. Derrick.”\n\n“Where was he--where is--the--the----”\n\n“Through the lungs.”\n\n“Will he get well? Tell me the truth.”\n\n“I don't know. Mrs. Derrick.”\n\nShe had all but fainted, and the old rancher, Garnett, half-carrying,\nhalf-leading her, took her to the one adjoining room--Minna Hooven's\nbedchamber. Dazed, numb with fear, she sat down on the edge of the bed,\nrocking herself back and forth, murmuring:\n\n“Harrie, Harrie, oh, my son, my little boy.”\n\nIn the outside room, Presley came and went, doing what he could to be of\nservice, sick with horror, trembling from head to foot.\n\nThe surviving members of both Leaguers and deputies--the warring\nfactions of the Railroad and the People--mingled together now with no\nthought of hostility. Presley helped the doctor to cover Christian's\nbody. S. Behrman and Ruggles held bowls of water while Osterman was\nattended to. The horror of that dreadful business had driven all other\nconsiderations from the mind. The sworn foes of the last hour had no\nthought of anything but to care for those whom, in their fury, they had\nshot down. The marshal, abandoning for that day the attempt to serve the\nwrits, departed for San Francisco.\n\nThe bodies had been brought in from the road where they fell. Annixter's\ncorpse had been laid upon the bed; those of Dabney and Hooven,\nwhose wounds had all been in the face and head, were covered with a\ntablecloth. Upon the floor, places were made for the others. Cutter\nand Ruggles rode into Guadalajara to bring out the doctor there, and to\ntelephone to Bonneville for others.\n\nOsterman had not at any time since the shooting, lost consciousness.\nHe lay upon the floor of Hooven's house, bare to the waist, bandages\nof adhesive tape reeved about his abdomen and shoulder. His eyes were\nhalf-closed. Presley, who looked after him, pending the arrival of a\nhack from Bonneville that was to take him home, knew that he was in\nagony.\n\nBut this poser, this silly fellow, this cracker of jokes, whom no one\nhad ever taken very seriously, at the last redeemed himself. When at\nlength, the doctor had arrived, he had, for the first time, opened his\neyes.\n\n“I can wait,” he said. “Take Harran first.” And when at length, his turn\nhad come, and while the sweat rolled from his forehead as the doctor\nbegan probing for the bullet, he had reached out his free arm and taken\nPresley's hand in his, gripping it harder and harder, as the probe\nentered the wound. His breath came short through his nostrils; his face,\nthe face of a comic actor, with its high cheek bones, bald forehead,\nand salient ears, grew paler and paler, his great slit of a mouth shut\ntight, but he uttered no groan.\n\nWhen the worst anguish was over and he could find breath to speak, his\nfirst words had been:\n\n“Were any of the others badly hurt?”\n\nAs Presley stood by the door of the house after bringing in a pail of\nwater for the doctor, he was aware of a party of men who had struck\noff from the road on the other side of the irrigating ditch and were\nadvancing cautiously into the field of wheat. He wondered what it meant\nand Cutter, coming up at that moment, Presley asked him if he knew.\n\n“It's Delaney,” said Cutter. “It seems that when he was shot he crawled\noff into the wheat. They are looking for him there.”\n\nPresley had forgotten all about the buster and had only a vague\nrecollection of seeing him slide from his horse at the beginning of the\nfight. Anxious to know what had become of him, he hurried up and joined\nthe party of searchers.\n\n“We better look out,” said one of the young men, “how we go fooling\naround in here. If he's alive yet he's just as liable as not to think\nwe're after him and take a shot at us.”\n\n“I guess there ain't much fight left in him,” another answered. “Look at\nthe wheat here.”\n\n“Lord! He's bled like a stuck pig.”\n\n“Here's his hat,” abruptly exclaimed the leader of the party. “He can't\nbe far off. Let's call him.”\n\nThey called repeatedly without getting any answer, then proceeded\ncautiously. All at once the men in advance stopped so suddenly that\nthose following carromed against them. There was an outburst of\nexclamation.\n\n“Here he is!”\n\n“Good Lord! Sure, that's him.”\n\n“Poor fellow, poor fellow.”\n\nThe cow-puncher lay on his back, deep in the wheat, his knees drawn up,\nhis eyes wide open, his lips brown. Rigidly gripped in one hand was his\nempty revolver.\n\nThe men, farm hands from the neighbouring ranches, young fellows from\nGuadalajara, drew back in instinctive repulsion. One at length ventured\nnear, peering down into the face.\n\n“Is he dead?” inquired those in the rear.\n\n“I don't know.”\n\n“Well, put your hand on his heart.” “No! I--I don't want to.”\n\n“What you afraid of?”\n\n“Well, I just don't want to touch him, that's all. It's bad luck. YOU\nfeel his heart.”\n\n“You can't always tell by that.”\n\n“How can you tell, then? Pshaw, you fellows make me sick. Here, let me\nget there. I'll do it.”\n\nThere was a long pause, as the other bent down and laid his hand on the\ncow-puncher's breast.\n\n“Well?”\n\n“I can't tell. Sometimes I think I feel it beat and sometimes I don't. I\nnever saw a dead man before.”\n\n“Well, you can't tell by the heart.”\n\n“What's the good of talking so blame much. Dead or not, let's carry him\nback to the house.”\n\nTwo or three ran back to the road for planks from the broken bridge.\nWhen they returned with these a litter was improvised, and throwing\ntheir coats over the body, the party carried it back to the road. The\ndoctor was summoned and declared the cow-puncher to have been dead over\nhalf an hour.\n\n“What did I tell you?” exclaimed one of the group.\n\n“Well, I never said he wasn't dead,” protested the other. “I only said\nyou couldn't always tell by whether his heart beat or not.”\n\nBut all at once there was a commotion. The wagon containing Mrs. Hooven,\nMinna, and little Hilda drove up.\n\n“Eh, den, my men,” cried Mrs. Hooven, wildly interrogating the faces of\nthe crowd. “Whadt has happun? Sey, den, dose vellers, hev dey hurdt my\nmen, eh, whadt?”\n\nShe sprang from the wagon, followed by Minna with Hilda in her arms. The\ncrowd bore back as they advanced, staring at them in silence.\n\n“Eh, whadt has happun, whadt has happun?” wailed Mrs. Hooven, as she\nhurried on, her two hands out before her, the fingers spread wide. “Eh,\nHooven, eh, my men, are you alle righdt?”\n\nShe burst into the house. Hooven's body had been removed to an adjoining\nroom, the bedroom of the house, and to this room Mrs. Hooven--Minna\nstill at her heels--proceeded, guided by an instinct born of the\noccasion. Those in the outside room, saying no word, made way for them.\nThey entered, closing the door behind them, and through all the rest\nof that terrible day, no sound nor sight of them was had by those who\ncrowded into and about that house of death. Of all the main actors of\nthe tragedy of the fight in the ditch, they remained the least noted,\nobtruded themselves the least upon the world's observation. They were,\nfor the moment, forgotten.\n\nBut by now Hooven's house was the centre of an enormous crowd. A vast\nconcourse of people from Bonneville, from Guadalajara, from the ranches,\nswelled by the thousands who had that morning participated in the rabbit\ndrive, surged about the place; men and women, young boys, young girls,\nfarm hands, villagers, townspeople, ranchers, railroad employees,\nMexicans, Spaniards, Portuguese. Presley, returning from the search for\nDelaney's body, had to fight his way to the house again.\n\nAnd from all this multitude there rose an indefinable murmur. As\nyet, there was no menace in it, no anger. It was confusion merely,\nbewilderment, the first long-drawn “oh!” that greets the news of some\ngreat tragedy. The people had taken no thought as yet. Curiosity was\ntheir dominant impulse. Every one wanted to see what had been done;\nfailing that, to hear of it, and failing that, to be near the scene of\nthe affair. The crowd of people packed the road in front of the house\nfor nearly a quarter of a mile in either direction. They balanced\nthemselves upon the lower strands of the barbed wire fence in their\neffort to see over each others' shoulders; they stood on the seats of\ntheir carts, buggies, and farm wagons, a few even upon the saddles of\ntheir riding horses. They crowded, pushed, struggled, surged forward and\nback without knowing why, converging incessantly upon Hooven's house.\n\nWhen, at length, Presley got to the gate, he found a carry-all drawn up\nbefore it. Between the gate and the door of the house a lane had been\nformed, and as he paused there a moment, a group of Leaguers, among\nwhom were Garnett and Gethings, came slowly from the door carrying\nold Broderson in their arms. The doctor, bareheaded and in his shirt\nsleeves, squinting in the sunlight, attended them, repeating at every\nstep:\n\n“Slow, slow, take it easy, gentlemen.”\n\nOld Broderson was unconscious. His face was not pale, no bandages could\nbe seen. With infinite precautions, the men bore him to the carry-all\nand deposited him on the back seat; the rain flaps were let down on one\nside to shut off the gaze of the multitude.\n\nBut at this point a moment of confusion ensued. Presley, because of half\na dozen people who stood in his way, could not see what was going on.\nThere were exclamations, hurried movements. The doctor uttered a sharp\ncommand and a man ran back to the house returning on the instant with\nthe doctor's satchel. By this time, Presley was close to the wheels of\nthe carry-all and could see the doctor inside the vehicle bending over\nold Broderson.\n\n“Here it is, here it is,” exclaimed the man who had been sent to the\nhouse.\n\n“I won't need it,” answered the doctor, “he's dying now.”\n\nAt the words a great hush widened throughout the throng near at hand.\nSome men took off their hats.\n\n“Stand back,” protested the doctor quietly, “stand back, good people,\nplease.”\n\nThe crowd bore back a little. In the silence, a woman began to sob. The\nseconds passed, then a minute. The horses of the carry-all shifted their\nfeet and whisked their tails, driving off the flies. At length, the\ndoctor got down from the carry-all, letting down the rain-flaps on that\nside as well.\n\n“Will somebody go home with the body?” he asked. Gethings stepped\nforward and took his place by the driver. The carry-all drove away.\n\nPresley reentered the house. During his absence it had been cleared of\nall but one or two of the Leaguers, who had taken part in the fight.\nHilma still sat on the bed with Annixter's head in her lap. S. Behrman,\nRuggles, and all the railroad party had gone. Osterman had been taken\naway in a hack and the tablecloth over Dabney's body replaced with\na sheet. But still unabated, agonised, raucous, came the sounds of\nHarran's breathing. Everything possible had already been done. For the\nmoment it was out of the question to attempt to move him. His mother and\nfather were at his side, Magnus, with a face of stone, his look fixed on\nthose persistently twitching eyes, Annie Derrick crouching at her son's\nside, one of his hands in hers, fanning his face continually with the\ncrumpled sheet of an old newspaper.\n\nPresley on tip-toes joined the group, looking on attentively. One of the\nsurgeons who had been called from Bonneville stood close by, watching\nHarran's face, his arms folded.\n\n“How is he?” Presley whispered.\n\n“He won't live,” the other responded.\n\nBy degrees the choke and gurgle of the breathing became more irregular\nand the lids closed over the twitching eyes. All at once the breath\nceased. Magnus shot an inquiring glance at the surgeon.\n\n“He is dead, Mr. Derrick,” the surgeon replied.\n\nAnnie Derrick, with a cry that rang through all the house, stretched\nherself over the body of her son, her head upon his breast, and the\nGovernor's great shoulders bowed never to rise again.\n\n“God help me and forgive me,” he groaned.\n\nPresley rushed from the house, beside himself with grief, with horror,\nwith pity, and with mad, insensate rage. On the porch outside Caraher\nmet him.\n\n“Is he--is he--” began the saloon-keeper.\n\n“Yes, he's dead,” cried Presley. “They're all dead, murdered, shot down,\ndead, dead, all of them. Whose turn is next?”\n\n“That's the way they killed my wife, Presley.”\n\n“Caraher,” cried Presley, “give me your hand. I've been wrong all the\ntime. The League is wrong. All the world is wrong. You are the only one\nof us all who is right. I'm with you from now on. BY GOD, I TOO, I'M A\nRED!”\n\nIn course of time, a farm wagon from Bonneville arrived at Hooven's. The\nbodies of Annixter and Harran were placed in it, and it drove down the\nLower Road towards the Los Muertos ranch houses.\n\nThe bodies of Delaney and Christian had already been carried to\nGuadalajara and thence taken by train to Bonneville.\n\nHilma followed the farm wagon in the Derricks' carry-all, with Magnus\nand his wife. During all that ride none of them spoke a word. It had\nbeen arranged that, since Quien Sabe was in the hands of the Railroad,\nHilma should come to Los Muertos. To that place also Annixter's body was\ncarried.\n\nLater on in the day, when it was almost evening, the undertaker's black\nwagon passed the Derricks' Home ranch on its way from Hooven's and\nturned into the county road towards Bonneville. The initial excitement\nof the affair of the irrigating ditch had died down; the crowd long\nsince had dispersed. By the time the wagon passed Caraher's saloon, the\nsun had set. Night was coming on.\n\nAnd the black wagon went on through the darkness, unattended, ignored,\nsolitary, carrying the dead body of Dabney, the silent old man of whom\nnothing was known but his name, who made no friends, whom nobody knew or\nspoke to, who had come from no one knew whence and who went no one knew\nwhither.\n\nTowards midnight of that same day, Mrs. Dyke was awakened by the sounds\nof groaning in the room next to hers. Magnus Derrick was not so\noccupied by Harran's death that he could not think of others who were in\ndistress, and when he had heard that Mrs. Dyke and Sidney, like Hilma,\nhad been turned out of Quien Sabe, he had thrown open Los Muertos to\nthem.\n\n“Though,” he warned them, “it is precarious hospitality at the best.”\n\nUntil late, Mrs. Dyke had sat up with Hilma, comforting her as best she\ncould, rocking her to and fro in her arms, crying with her, trying to\nquiet her, for once having given way to her grief, Hilma wept with a\nterrible anguish and a violence that racked her from head to foot, and\nat last, worn out, a little child again, had sobbed herself to sleep in\nthe older woman's arms, and as a little child, Mrs. Dyke had put her to\nbed and had retired herself.\n\nAroused a few hours later by the sounds of a distress that was physical,\nas well as mental, Mrs. Dyke hurried into Hilma's room, carrying the\nlamp with her. Mrs. Dyke needed no enlightenment. She woke Presley and\nbesought him to telephone to Bonneville at once, summoning a doctor.\nThat night Hilma in great pain suffered a miscarriage.\n\nPresley did not close his eyes once during the night; he did not even\nremove his clothes. Long after the doctor had departed and that house\nof tragedy had quieted down, he still remained in his place by the open\nwindow of his little room, looking off across the leagues of growing\nwheat, watching the slow kindling of the dawn. Horror weighed\nintolerably upon him. Monstrous things, huge, terrible, whose names he\nknew only too well, whirled at a gallop through his imagination, or rose\nspectral and grisly before the eyes of his mind. Harran dead, Annixter\ndead, Broderson dead, Osterman, perhaps, even at that moment dying.\nWhy, these men had made up his world. Annixter had been his best friend,\nHarran, his almost daily companion; Broderson and Osterman were familiar\nto him as brothers. They were all his associates, his good friends, the\ngroup was his environment, belonging to his daily life. And he, standing\nthere in the dust of the road by the irrigating ditch, had seen them\nshot. He found himself suddenly at his table, the candle burning at\nhis elbow, his journal before him, writing swiftly, the desire for\nexpression, the craving for outlet to the thoughts that clamoured\ntumultuous at his brain, never more insistent, more imperious. Thus he\nwrote:\n\n“Dabney dead, Hooven dead, Harran dead, Annixter dead, Broderson dead,\nOsterman dying, S. Behrman alive, successful; the Railroad in possession\nof Quien Sabe. I saw them shot. Not twelve hours since I stood there at\nthe irrigating ditch. Ah, that terrible moment of horror and confusion!\npowder smoke--flashing pistol barrels--blood stains--rearing horses--men\nstaggering to their death--Christian in a horrible posture, one rigid\nleg high in the air across his saddle--Broderson falling sideways into\nthe ditch--Osterman laying himself down, his head on his arms, as if\ntired, tired out. These things, I have seen them. The picture of this\nday's work is from henceforth part of my mind, part of ME. They have\ndone it, S. Behrman and the owners of the railroad have done it, while\nall the world looked on, while the people of these United States looked\non. Oh, come now and try your theories upon us, us of the ranchos, us,\nwho have suffered, us, who KNOW. Oh, talk to US now of the 'rights\nof Capital,' talk to US of the Trust, talk to US of the 'equilibrium\nbetween the classes.' Try your ingenious ideas upon us. WE KNOW. I\ncannot tell whether or not your theories are excellent. I do not know if\nyour ideas are plausible. I do not know how practical is your scheme of\nsociety. I do not know if the Railroad has a right to our lands, but I\nDO know that Harran is dead, that Annixter is dead, that Broderson is\ndead, that Hooven is dead, that Osterman is dying, and that S. Behrman\nis alive, successful, triumphant; that he has ridden into possession of\na principality over the dead bodies of five men shot down by his hired\nassociates.\n\n“I can see the outcome. The Railroad will prevail. The Trust will\noverpower us. Here in this corner of a great nation, here, on the edge\nof the continent, here, in this valley of the West, far from the great\ncentres, isolated, remote, lost, the great iron hand crushes life from\nus, crushes liberty and the pursuit of happiness from us, and our little\nstruggles, our moment's convulsion of death agony causes not one jar in\nthe vast, clashing machinery of the nation's life; a fleck of grit in\nthe wheels, perhaps, a grain of sand in the cogs--the momentary creak\nof the axle is the mother's wail of bereavement, the wife's cry of\nanguish--and the great wheel turns, spinning smooth again, even again,\nand the tiny impediment of a second, scarce noticed, is forgotten. Make\nthe people believe that the faint tremour in their great engine is a\nmenace to its function? What a folly to think of it. Tell them of the\ndanger and they will laugh at you. Tell them, five years from now,\nthe story of the fight between the League of the San Joaquin and the\nRailroad and it will not be believed. What! a pitched battle between\nFarmer and Railroad, a battle that cost the lives of seven men?\nImpossible, it could not have happened. Your story is fiction--is\nexaggerated.\n\n“Yet it is Lexington--God help us, God enlighten us, God rouse us from\nour lethargy--it is Lexington; farmers with guns in their hands fighting\nfor Liberty. Is our State of California the only one that has its\nancient and hereditary foe? Are there no other Trusts between the oceans\nthan this of the Pacific and Southwestern Railroad? Ask yourselves, you\nof the Middle West, ask yourselves, you of the North, ask yourselves,\nyou of the East, ask yourselves, you of the South--ask yourselves, every\ncitizen of every State from Maine to Mexico, from the Dakotas to the\nCarolinas, have you not the monster in your boundaries? If it is not a\nTrust of transportation, it is only another head of the same Hydra.\nIs not our death struggle typical? Is it not one of many, is it\nnot symbolical of the great and terrible conflict that is going on\neverywhere in these United States? Ah, you people, blind, bound,\ntricked, betrayed, can you not see it? Can you not see how the monsters\nhave plundered your treasures and holding them in the grip of their\niron claws, dole them out to you only at the price of your blood, at the\nprice of the lives of your wives and your little children? You give your\nbabies to Moloch for the loaf of bread you have kneaded yourselves.\nYou offer your starved wives to Juggernaut for the iron nail you have\nyourselves compounded.”\n\nHe spent the night over his journal, writing down such thoughts as\nthese or walking the floor from wall to wall, or, seized at times with\nunreasoning horror and blind rage, flinging himself face downward upon\nhis bed, vowing with inarticulate cries that neither S. Behrman nor\nShelgrim should ever live to consummate their triumph.\n\nMorning came and with it the daily papers and news. Presley did not even\nglance at the “Mercury.” Bonneville published two other daily journals\nthat professed to voice the will and reflect the temper of the people\nand these he read eagerly.\n\nOsterman was yet alive and there were chances of his recovery. The\nLeague--some three hundred of its members had gathered at Bonneville\nover night and were patrolling the streets and, still resolved to\nkeep the peace, were even guarding the railroad shops and buildings.\nFurthermore, the Leaguers had issued manifestoes, urging all citizens\nto preserve law and order, yet summoning an indignation meeting to be\nconvened that afternoon at the City Opera House.\n\nIt appeared from the newspapers that those who obstructed the marshal\nin the discharge of his duty could be proceeded against by the District\nAttorney on information or by bringing the matter before the Grand Jury.\nBut the Grand Jury was not at that time in session, and it was known\nthat there were no funds in the marshal's office to pay expenses for the\nsummoning of jurors or the serving of processes. S. Behrman and Ruggles\nin interviews stated that the Railroad withdrew entirely from the fight;\nthe matter now, according to them, was between the Leaguers and the\nUnited States Government; they washed their hands of the whole business.\nThe ranchers could settle with Washington. But it seemed that Congress\nhad recently forbade the use of troops for civil purposes; the whole\nmatter of the League-Railroad contest was evidently for the moment to be\nleft in status quo.\n\nBut to Presley's mind the most important piece of news that morning was\nthe report of the action of the Railroad upon hearing of the battle.\n\nInstantly Bonneville had been isolated. Not a single local train was\nrunning, not one of the through trains made any halt at the station. The\nmails were not moved. Further than this, by some arrangement difficult\nto understand, the telegraph operators at Bonneville and Guadalajara,\nacting under orders, refused to receive any telegrams except those\nemanating from railway officials. The story of the fight, the story\ncreating the first impression, was to be told to San Francisco and the\noutside world by S. Behrman, Ruggles, and the local P. and S. W. agents.\n\nAn hour before breakfast, the undertakers arrived and took charge of the\nbodies of Harran and Annixter. Presley saw neither Hilma, Magnus, nor\nMrs. Derrick. The doctor came to look after Hilma. He breakfasted with\nMrs. Dyke and Presley, and from him Presley learned that Hilma would\nrecover both from the shock of her husband's death and from her\nmiscarriage of the previous night.\n\n“She ought to have her mother with her,” said the physician. “She does\nnothing but call for her or beg to be allowed to go to her. I have tried\nto get a wire through to Mrs. Tree, but the company will not take it,\nand even if I could get word to her, how could she get down here? There\nare no trains.”\n\nBut Presley found that it was impossible for him to stay at Los Muertos\nthat day. Gloom and the shadow of tragedy brooded heavy over the place.\nA great silence pervaded everything, a silence broken only by the\nsubdued coming and going of the undertaker and his assistants. When\nPresley, having resolved to go into Bonneville, came out through the\ndoorway of the house, he found the undertaker tying a long strip of\ncrape to the bell-handle.\n\nPresley saddled his pony and rode into town. By this time, after long\nhours of continued reflection upon one subject, a sombre brooding\nmalevolence, a deep-seated desire of revenge, had grown big within his\nmind. The first numbness had passed off; familiarity with what had been\ndone had blunted the edge of horror, and now the impulse of retaliation\nprevailed. At first, the sullen anger of defeat, the sense of outrage,\nhad only smouldered, but the more he brooded, the fiercer flamed his\nrage. Sudden paroxysms of wrath gripped him by the throat; abrupt\noutbursts of fury injected his eyes with blood. He ground his teeth, his\nmouth filled with curses, his hands clenched till they grew white and\nbloodless. Was the Railroad to triumph then in the end? After all those\nmonths of preparation, after all those grandiloquent resolutions, after\nall the arrogant presumption of the League! The League! what a farce;\nwhat had it amounted to when the crisis came? Was the Trust to crush\nthem all so easily? Was S. Behrman to swallow Los Muertos? S. Behrman!\nPresley saw him plainly, huge, rotund, white; saw his jowl tremulous and\nobese, the roll of fat over his collar sprinkled with sparse hairs, the\ngreat stomach with its brown linen vest and heavy watch chain of hollow\nlinks, clinking against the buttons of imitation pearl. And this man was\nto crush Magnus Derrick--had already stamped the life from such men as\nHarran and Annixter. This man, in the name of the Trust, was to grab Los\nMuertos as he had grabbed Quien Sabe, and after Los Muertos, Broderson's\nranch, then Osterman's, then others, and still others, the whole valley,\nthe whole State.\n\nPresley beat his forehead with his clenched fist as he rode on.\n\n“No,” he cried, “no, kill him, kill him, kill him with my hands.”\n\nThe idea of it put him beside himself. Oh, to sink his fingers deep into\nthe white, fat throat of the man, to clutch like iron into the great\npuffed jowl of him, to wrench out the life, to batter it out, strangle\nit out, to pay him back for the long years of extortion and oppression,\nto square accounts for bribed jurors, bought judges, corrupted\nlegislatures, to have justice for the trick of the Ranchers' Railroad\nCommission, the charlatanism of the “ten per cent. cut,” the ruin of\nDyke, the seizure of Quien Sabe, the murder of Harran, the assassination\nof Annixter!\n\nIt was in such mood that he reached Caraher's. The saloon-keeper had\njust opened his place and was standing in his doorway, smoking his pipe.\nPresley dismounted and went in and the two had a long talk.\n\nWhen, three hours later, Presley came out of the saloon and rode\non towards Bonneville, his face was very pale, his lips shut tight,\nresolute, determined. His manner was that of a man whose mind is made\nup. The hour for the mass meeting at the Opera House had been set for\none o'clock, but long before noon the street in front of the building\nand, in fact, all the streets in its vicinity, were packed from side to\nside with a shifting, struggling, surging, and excited multitude. There\nwere few women in the throng, but hardly a single male inhabitant of\neither Bonneville or Guadalajara was absent. Men had even come from\nVisalia and Pixley. It was no longer the crowd of curiosity seekers that\nhad thronged around Hooven's place by the irrigating ditch; the People\nwere no longer confused, bewildered. A full realisation of just what had\nbeen done the day before was clear now in the minds of all. Business was\nsuspended; nearly all the stores were closed. Since early morning the\nmembers of the League had put in an appearance and rode from point to\npoint, their rifles across their saddle pommels. Then, by ten o'clock,\nthe streets had begun to fill up, the groups on the corners grew\nand merged into one another; pedestrians, unable to find room on\nthe sidewalks, took to the streets. Hourly the crowd increased till\nshoulders touched and elbows, till free circulation became impeded, then\ncongested, then impossible. The crowd, a solid mass, was wedged tight\nfrom store front to store front. And from all this throng, this single\nunit, this living, breathing organism--the People--there rose a droning,\nterrible note. It was not yet the wild, fierce clamour of riot and\ninsurrection, shrill, high pitched; but it was a beginning, the growl of\nthe awakened brute, feeling the iron in its flank, heaving up its head\nwith bared teeth, the throat vibrating to the long, indrawn snarl of\nwrath.\n\nThus the forenoon passed, while the people, their bulk growing hourly\nvaster, kept to the streets, moving slowly backward and forward,\noscillating in the grooves of the thoroughfares, the steady, low-pitched\ngrowl rising continually into the hot, still air.\n\nThen, at length, about twelve o'clock, the movement of the throng\nassumed definite direction. It set towards the Opera House. Presley, who\nhad left his pony at the City livery stable, found himself caught in\nthe current and carried slowly forward in its direction. His arms were\npinioned to his sides by the press, the crush against his body was all\nbut rib-cracking, he could hardly draw his breath. All around him rose\nand fell wave after wave of faces, hundreds upon hundreds, thousands\nupon thousands, red, lowering, sullen. All were set in one direction and\nslowly, slowly they advanced, crowding closer, till they almost touched\none another. For reasons that were inexplicable, great, tumultuous\nheavings, like ground-swells of an incoming tide, surged over and\nthrough the multitude. At times, Presley, lifted from his feet, was\nswept back, back, back, with the crowd, till the entrance of the Opera\nHouse was half a block away; then, the returning billow beat back again\nand swung him along, gasping, staggering, clutching, till he was landed\nonce more in the vortex of frantic action in front of the foyer. Here\nthe waves were shorter, quicker, the crushing pressure on all sides of\nhis body left him without strength to utter the cry that rose to his\nlips; then, suddenly the whole mass of struggling, stamping,\nfighting, writhing men about him seemed, as it were, to rise, to lift,\nmultitudinous, swelling, gigantic. A mighty rush dashed Presley forward\nin its leap. There was a moment's whirl of confused sights, congested\nfaces, opened mouths, bloodshot eyes, clutching hands; a moment's\noutburst of furious sound, shouts, cheers, oaths; a moment's jam wherein\nPresley veritably believed his ribs must snap like pipestems and he\nwas carried, dazed, breathless, helpless, an atom on the crest of\na storm-driven wave, up the steps of the Opera House, on into the\nvestibule, through the doors, and at last into the auditorium of the\nhouse itself.\n\nThere was a mad rush for places; men disdaining the aisle, stepped\nfrom one orchestra chair to another, striding over the backs of seats,\nleaving the print of dusty feet upon the red plush cushions. In a\ntwinkling the house was filled from stage to topmost gallery. The\naisles were packed solid, even on the edge of the stage itself men were\nsitting, a black fringe on either side of the footlights.\n\nThe curtain was up, disclosing a half-set scene,--the flats, leaning at\nperilous angles,--that represented some sort of terrace, the pavement,\nalternate squares of black and white marble, while red, white, and\nyellow flowers were represented as growing from urns and vases. A long,\ndouble row of chairs stretched across the scene from wing to wing,\nflanking a table covered with a red cloth, on which was set a pitcher of\nwater and a speaker's gavel.\n\nPromptly these chairs were filled up with members of the League,\nthe audience cheering as certain well-known figures made their\nappearance--Garnett of the Ruby ranch, Gethings of the San Pablo, Keast\nof the ranch of the same name, Chattern of the Bonanza, elderly men,\nbearded, slow of speech, deliberate.\n\nGarnett opened the meeting; his speech was plain, straightforward,\nmatter-of-fact. He simply told what had happened. He announced that\ncertain resolutions were to be drawn up. He introduced the next speaker.\n\nThis one pleaded for moderation. He was conservative. All along he had\nopposed the idea of armed resistance except as the very last resort.\nHe “deplored” the terrible affair of yesterday. He begged the people\nto wait in patience, to attempt no more violence. He informed them that\narmed guards of the League were, at that moment, patrolling Los Muertos,\nBroderson's, and Osterman's. It was well known that the United States\nmarshal confessed himself powerless to serve the writs. There would be\nno more bloodshed.\n\n“We have had,” he continued, “bloodshed enough, and I want to say right\nhere that I am not so sure but what yesterday's terrible affair might\nhave been avoided. A gentleman whom we all esteem, who from the first\nhas been our recognised leader, is, at this moment, mourning the loss of\na young son, killed before his eyes. God knows that I sympathise, as do\nwe all, in the affliction of our President. I am sorry for him. My heart\ngoes out to him in this hour of distress, but, at the same time, the\nposition of the League must be defined. We owe it to ourselves, we owe\nit to the people of this county. The League armed for the very purpose\nof preserving the peace, not of breaking it. We believed that with six\nhundred armed and drilled men at our disposal, ready to muster at a\nmoment's call, we could so overawe any attempt to expel us from our\nlands that such an attempt would not be made until the cases pending\nbefore the Supreme Court had been decided. If when the enemy appeared in\nour midst yesterday they had been met by six hundred rifles, it is not\nconceivable that the issue would have been forced. No fight would have\nensued, and to-day we would not have to mourn the deaths of four of our\nfellow-citizens. A mistake has been made and we of the League must not\nbe held responsible.”\n\nThe speaker sat down amidst loud applause from the Leaguers and less\npronounced demonstrations on the part of the audience.\n\nA second Leaguer took his place, a tall, clumsy man, half-rancher,\nhalf-politician.\n\n“I want to second what my colleague has just said,” he began. “This\nmatter of resisting the marshal when he tried to put the Railroad\ndummies in possession on the ranches around here, was all talked over\nin the committee meetings of the League long ago. It never was our\nintention to fire a single shot. No such absolute authority as was\nassumed yesterday was delegated to anybody. Our esteemed President is\nall right, but we all know that he is a man who loves authority and who\nlikes to go his own gait without accounting to anybody. We--the rest of\nus Leaguers--never were informed as to what was going on. We supposed,\nof course, that watch was being kept on the Railroad so as we wouldn't\nbe taken by surprise as we were yesterday. And it seems no watch was\nkept at all, or if there was, it was mighty ineffective. Our idea was to\nforestall any movement on the part of the Railroad and then when we\nknew the marshal was coming down, to call a meeting of our Executive\nCommittee and decide as to what should be done. We ought to have had\ntime to call out the whole League. Instead of that, what happens? While\nwe're all off chasing rabbits, the Railroad is allowed to steal a march\non us and when it is too late, a handful of Leaguers is got together and\na fight is precipitated and our men killed. I'M sorry for our President,\ntoo. No one is more so, but I want to put myself on record as believing\nhe did a hasty and inconsiderate thing. If he had managed right, he\ncould have had six hundred men to oppose the Railroad and there would\nnot have been any gun fight or any killing. He DIDN'T manage right and\nthere WAS a killing and I don't see as how the League ought to be\nheld responsible. The idea of the League, the whole reason why it\nwas organised, was to protect ALL the ranches of this valley from the\nRailroad, and it looks to me as if the lives of our fellow-citizens\nhad been sacrificed, not in defending ALL of our ranches, but just in\ndefence of one of them--Los Muertos--the one that Mr. Derrick owns.”\n\nThe speaker had no more than regained his seat when a man was seen\npushing his way from the back of the stage towards Garnett. He handed\nthe rancher a note, at the same time whispering in his ear. Garnett read\nthe note, then came forward to the edge of the stage, holding up his\nhand. When the audience had fallen silent he said:\n\n“I have just received sad news. Our friend and fellow-citizen, Mr.\nOsterman, died this morning between eleven and twelve o'clock.”\n\nInstantly there was a roar. Every man in the building rose to his feet,\nshouting, gesticulating. The roar increased, the Opera House trembled\nto it, the gas jets in the lighted chandeliers vibrated to it. It was a\nraucous howl of execration, a bellow of rage, inarticulate, deafening.\n\nA tornado of confusion swept whirling from wall to wall and the madness\nof the moment seized irresistibly upon Presley. He forgot himself; he no\nlonger was master of his emotions or his impulses. All at once he found\nhimself upon the stage, facing the audience, flaming with excitement,\nhis imagination on fire, his arms uplifted in fierce, wild gestures,\nwords leaping to his mind in a torrent that could not be withheld.\n\n“One more dead,” he cried, “one more. Harran dead, Annixter dead,\nBroderson dead, Dabney dead, Osterman dead, Hooven dead; shot down,\nkilled, killed in the defence of their homes, killed in the defence of\ntheir rights, killed for the sake of liberty. How long must it go on?\nHow long must we suffer? Where is the end; what is the end? How long\nmust the iron-hearted monster feed on our life's blood? How long must\nthis terror of steam and steel ride upon our necks? Will you never be\nsatisfied, will you never relent, you, our masters, you, our lords,\nyou, our kings, you, our task-masters, you, our Pharoahs. Will you never\nlisten to that command 'LET MY PEOPLE GO'? Oh, that cry ringing down the\nages. Hear it, hear it. It is the voice of the Lord God speaking in his\nprophets. Hear it, hear it--'Let My people go!' Rameses heard it in his\npylons at Thebes, Caesar heard it on the Palatine, the Bourbon Louis\nheard it at Versailles, Charles Stuart heard it at Whitehall, the white\nCzar heard it in the Kremlin,--'LET MY PEOPLE GO.' It is the cry of the\nnations, the great voice of the centuries; everywhere it is raised. The\nvoice of God is the voice of the People. The people cry out 'Let us, the\nPeople, God's people, go.' You, our masters, you, our kings, you, our\ntyrants, don't you hear us? Don't you hear God speaking in us? Will you\nnever let us go? How long at length will you abuse our patience? How\nlong will you drive us? How long will you harass us? Will nothing daunt\nyou? Does nothing check you? Do you not know that to ignore our cry\ntoo long is to wake the Red Terror? Rameses refused to listen to it\nand perished miserably. Caesar refused to listen and was stabbed in\nthe Senate House. The Bourbon Louis refused to listen and died on the\nguillotine; Charles Stuart refused to listen and died on the block; the\nwhite Czar refused to listen and was blown up in his own capital. Will\nyou let it come to that? Will you drive us to it? We who boast of our\nland of freedom, we who live in the country of liberty? Go on as you\nhave begun and it WILL come to that. Turn a deaf ear to that cry of 'Let\nMy people go' too long and another cry will be raised, that you cannot\nchoose but hear, a cry that you cannot shut out. It will be the cry of\nthe man on the street, the 'a la Bastille' that wakes the Red Terror and\nunleashes Revolution. Harassed, plundered, exasperated, desperate, the\npeople will turn at last as they have turned so many, many times before.\nYou, our lords, you, our task-masters, you, our kings; you have caught\nyour Samson, you have made his strength your own. You have shorn\nhis head; you have put out his eyes; you have set him to turn your\nmillstones, to grind the grist for your mills; you have made him a shame\nand a mock. Take care, oh, as you love your lives, take care, lest some\nday calling upon the Lord his God he reach not out his arms for the\npillars of your temples.”\n\nThe audience, at first bewildered, confused by this unexpected\ninvective, suddenly took fire at his last words. There was a roar of\napplause; then, more significant than mere vociferation, Presley's\nlisteners, as he began to speak again, grew suddenly silent. His next\nsentences were uttered in the midst of a profound stillness.\n\n“They own us, these task-masters of ours; they own our homes, they own\nour legislatures. We cannot escape from them. There is no redress. We\nare told we can defeat them by the ballot-box. They own the ballot-box.\nWe are told that we must look to the courts for redress; they own the\ncourts. We know them for what they are,--ruffians in politics, ruffians\nin finance, ruffians in law, ruffians in trade, bribers, swindlers, and\ntricksters. No outrage too great to daunt them, no petty larceny too\nsmall to shame them; despoiling a government treasury of a million\ndollars, yet picking the pockets of a farm hand of the price of a loaf\nof bread.\n\n“They swindle a nation of a hundred million and call it Financiering;\nthey levy a blackmail and call it Commerce; they corrupt a legislature\nand call it Politics; they bribe a judge and call it Law; they hire\nblacklegs to carry out their plans and call it Organisation; they\nprostitute the honour of a State and call it Competition.\n\n“And this is America. We fought Lexington to free ourselves; we fought\nGettysburg to free others. Yet the yoke remains; we have only shifted it\nto the other shoulder. We talk of liberty--oh, the farce of it, oh,\nthe folly of it! We tell ourselves and teach our children that we have\nachieved liberty, that we no longer need fight for it. Why, the fight is\njust beginning and so long as our conception of liberty remains as it is\nto-day, it will continue.\n\n“For we conceive of Liberty in the statues we raise to her as a\nbeautiful woman, crowned, victorious, in bright armour and white robes,\na light in her uplifted hand--a serene, calm, conquering goddess. Oh,\nthe farce of it, oh, the folly of it! Liberty is NOT a crowned goddess,\nbeautiful, in spotless garments, victorious, supreme. Liberty is the Man\nIn the Street, a terrible figure, rushing through powder smoke, fouled\nwith the mud and ordure of the gutter, bloody, rampant, brutal, yelling\ncurses, in one hand a smoking rifle, in the other, a blazing torch.\n\n“Freedom is NOT given free to any who ask; Liberty is not born of the\ngods. She is a child of the People, born in the very height and heat of\nbattle, born from death, stained with blood, grimed with powder. And she\ngrows to be not a goddess, but a Fury, a fearful figure, slaying friend\nand foe alike, raging, insatiable, merciless, the Red Terror.”\n\nPresley ceased speaking. Weak, shaking, scarcely knowing what he was\nabout, he descended from the stage. A prolonged explosion of applause\nfollowed, the Opera House roaring to the roof, men cheering, stamping,\nwaving their hats. But it was not intelligent applause. Instinctively as\nhe made his way out, Presley knew that, after all, he had not once held\nthe hearts of his audience. He had talked as he would have written; for\nall his scorn of literature, he had been literary. The men who listened\nto him, ranchers, country people, store-keepers, attentive though they\nwere, were not once sympathetic. Vaguely they had felt that here was\nsomething which other men--more educated--would possibly consider\neloquent. They applauded vociferously but perfunctorily, in order to\nappear to understand.\n\nPresley, for all his love of the people, saw clearly for one moment\nthat he was an outsider to their minds. He had not helped them nor their\ncause in the least; he never would.\n\nDisappointed, bewildered, ashamed, he made his way slowly from the Opera\nHouse and stood on the steps outside, thoughtful, his head bent.\n\nHe had failed, thus he told himself. In that moment of crisis, that at\nthe time he believed had been an inspiration, he had failed. The people\nwould not consider him, would not believe that he could do them service.\nThen suddenly he seemed to remember. The resolute set of his lips\nreturned once more. Pushing his way through the crowded streets, he went\non towards the stable where he had left his pony.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Opera House, a great commotion had occurred. Magnus\nDerrick had appeared.\n\nOnly a sense of enormous responsibility, of gravest duty could have\nprevailed upon Magnus to have left his house and the dead body of his\nson that day. But he was the President of the League, and never since\nits organisation had a meeting of such importance as this one been held.\nHe had been in command at the irrigating ditch the day before. It was\nhe who had gathered the handful of Leaguers together. It was he who must\nbear the responsibility of the fight.\n\nWhen he had entered the Opera House, making his way down the central\naisle towards the stage, a loud disturbance had broken out, partly\napplause, partly a meaningless uproar. Many had pressed forward to shake\nhis hand, but others were not found wanting who, formerly his staunch\nsupporters, now scenting opposition in the air, held back, hesitating,\nafraid to compromise themselves by adhering to the fortunes of a man\nwhose actions might be discredited by the very organisation of which he\nwas the head.\n\nDeclining to take the chair of presiding officer which Garnett offered\nhim, the Governor withdrew to an angle of the stage, where he was joined\nby Keast.\n\nThis one, still unalterably devoted to Magnus, acquainted him briefly\nwith the tenor of the speeches that had been made.\n\n“I am ashamed of them, Governor,” he protested indignantly, “to lose\ntheir nerve now! To fail you now! it makes my blood boil. If you had\nsucceeded yesterday, if all had gone well, do you think we would have\nheard of any talk of 'assumption of authority,' or 'acting without\nadvice and consent'? As if there was any time to call a meeting of the\nExecutive Committee. If you hadn't acted as you did, the whole county\nwould have been grabbed by the Railroad. Get up, Governor, and bring 'em\nall up standing. Just tear 'em all to pieces, show 'em that you are the\nhead, the boss. That's what they need. That killing yesterday has shaken\nthe nerve clean out of them.”\n\nFor the instant the Governor was taken all aback. What, his lieutenants\nwere failing him? What, he was to be questioned, interpolated upon\nyesterday's “irrepressible conflict”? Had disaffection appeared in\nthe ranks of the League--at this, of all moments? He put from him his\nterrible grief. The cause was in danger. At the instant he was the\nPresident of the League only, the chief, the master. A royal anger\nsurged within him, a wide, towering scorn of opposition. He would\ncrush this disaffection in its incipiency, would vindicate himself and\nstrengthen the cause at one and the same time. He stepped forward and\nstood in the speaker's place, turning partly toward the audience, partly\ntoward the assembled Leaguers.\n\n“Gentlemen of the League,” he began, “citizens of Bonneville”\n\nBut at once the silence in which the Governor had begun to speak was\nbroken by a shout. It was as though his words had furnished a signal. In\na certain quarter of the gallery, directly opposite, a man arose, and in\na voice partly of derision, partly of defiance, cried out:\n\n“How about the bribery of those two delegates at Sacramento? Tell us\nabout that. That's what we want to hear about.”\n\nA great confusion broke out. The first cry was repeated not only by\nthe original speaker, but by a whole group of which he was but a part.\nOthers in the audience, however, seeing in the disturbance only the\nclamour of a few Railroad supporters, attempted to howl them down,\nhissing vigorously and exclaiming:\n\n“Put 'em out, put 'em out.”\n\n“Order, order,” called Garnett, pounding with his gavel. The whole Opera\nHouse was in an uproar.\n\nBut the interruption of the Governor's speech was evidently not\nunpremeditated. It began to look like a deliberate and planned attack.\nPersistently, doggedly, the group in the gallery vociferated: “Tell us\nhow you bribed the delegates at Sacramento. Before you throw mud at the\nRailroad, let's see if you are clean yourself.”\n\n“Put 'em out, put 'em out.”\n\n“Briber, briber--Magnus Derrick, unconvicted briber! Put him out.”\n\nKeast, beside himself with anger, pushed down the aisle underneath where\nthe recalcitrant group had its place and, shaking his fist, called up at\nthem:\n\n“You were paid to break up this meeting. If you have anything to\nsay; you will be afforded the opportunity, but if you do not let the\ngentleman proceed, the police will be called upon to put you out.”\n\nBut at this, the man who had raised the first shout leaned over the\nbalcony rail, and, his face flaming with wrath, shouted:\n\n“YAH! talk to me of your police. Look out we don't call on them first\nto arrest your President for bribery. You and your howl about law and\njustice and corruption! Here”--he turned to the audience--“read about\nhim, read the story of how the Sacramento convention was bought by\nMagnus Derrick, President of the San Joaquin League. Here's the facts\nprinted and proved.”\n\nWith the words, he stooped down and from under his seat dragged forth a\ngreat package of extra editions of the “Bonneville Mercury,” not an hour\noff the presses. Other equally large bundles of the paper appeared in\nthe hands of the surrounding group. The strings were cut and in handfuls\nand armfuls the papers were flung out over the heads of the audience\nunderneath. The air was full of the flutter of the newly printed sheets.\nThey swarmed over the rim of the gallery like clouds of monstrous,\nwinged insects, settled upon the heads and into the hands of the\naudience, were passed swiftly from man to man, and within five minutes\nof the first outbreak every one in the Opera House had read Genslinger's\ndetailed and substantiated account of Magnus Derrick's “deal” with the\npolitical bosses of the Sacramento convention.\n\nGenslinger, after pocketing the Governor's hush money, had “sold him\nout.”\n\nKeast, one quiver of indignation, made his way back upon the stage. The\nLeaguers were in wild confusion. Half the assembly of them were on their\nfeet, bewildered, shouting vaguely. From proscenium wall to foyer, the\nOpera House was a tumult of noise. The gleam of the thousands of the\n“Mercury” extras was like the flash of white caps on a troubled sea.\n\nKeast faced the audience.\n\n“Liars,” he shouted, striving with all the power of his voice to\ndominate the clamour, “liars and slanderers. Your paper is the paid\norgan of the corporation. You have not one shadow of proof to back you\nup. Do you choose this, of all times, to heap your calumny upon the head\nof an honourable gentleman, already prostrated by your murder of his\nson? Proofs--we demand your proofs!”\n\n“We've got the very assemblymen themselves,” came back the answering\nshout. “Let Derrick speak. Where is he hiding? If this is a lie, let him\ndeny it. Let HIM DISPROVE the charge.” “Derrick, Derrick,” thundered the\nOpera House.\n\nKeast wheeled about. Where was Magnus? He was not in sight upon the\nstage. He had disappeared. Crowding through the throng of Leaguers,\nKeast got from off the stage into the wings. Here the crowd was no less\ndense. Nearly every one had a copy of the “Mercury.” It was being read\naloud to groups here and there, and once Keast overheard the words,\n“Say, I wonder if this is true, after all?”\n\n“Well, and even if it was,” cried Keast, turning upon the speaker,\n“we should be the last ones to kick. In any case, it was done for our\nbenefit. It elected the Ranchers' Commission.”\n\n“A lot of benefit we got out of the Ranchers' Commission,” retorted the\nother.\n\n“And then,” protested a third speaker, “that ain't the way to do--if he\nDID do it--bribing legislatures. Why, we were bucking against corrupt\npolitics. We couldn't afford to be corrupt.”\n\nKeast turned away with a gesture of impatience. He pushed his way\nfarther on. At last, opening a small door in a hallway back of the\nstage, he came upon Magnus.\n\nThe room was tiny. It was a dressing-room. Only two nights before it\nhad been used by the leading actress of a comic opera troupe which\nhad played for three nights at Bonneville. A tattered sofa and limping\ntoilet table occupied a third of the space. The air was heavy with the\nsmell of stale grease paint, ointments, and sachet. Faded photographs\nof young women in tights and gauzes ornamented the mirror and the walls.\nUnderneath the sofa was an old pair of corsets. The spangled skirt of a\npink dress, turned inside out, hung against the wall.\n\nAnd in the midst of such environment, surrounded by an excited group\nof men who gesticulated and shouted in his very face, pale, alert,\nagitated, his thin lips pressed tightly together, stood Magnus Derrick.\n\n“Here,” cried Keast, as he entered, closing the door behind him,\n“where's the Governor? Here, Magnus, I've been looking for you. The\ncrowd has gone wild out there. You've got to talk 'em down. Come out\nthere and give those blacklegs the lie. They are saying you are hiding.”\n\nBut before Magnus could reply, Garnett turned to Keast.\n\n“Well, that's what we want him to do, and he won't do it.”\n\n“Yes, yes,” cried the half-dozen men who crowded around Magnus, “yes,\nthat's what we want him to do.”\n\nKeast turned to Magnus.\n\n“Why, what's all this, Governor?” he exclaimed. “You've got to answer\nthat. Hey? why don't you give 'em the lie?”\n\n“I--I,” Magnus loosened the collar about his throat “it is a lie. I will\nnot stoop--I would not--would be--it would be beneath my--my--it would\nbe beneath me.”\n\nKeast stared in amazement. Was this the Great Man the Leader,\nindomitable, of Roman integrity, of Roman valour, before whose voice\nwhole conventions had quailed? Was it possible he was AFRAID to face\nthose hired villifiers?\n\n“Well, how about this?” demanded Garnett suddenly. “It is a lie, isn't\nit? That Commission was elected honestly, wasn't it?”\n\n“How dare you, sir!” Magnus burst out. “How dare you question me--call\nme to account! Please understand, sir, that I tolerate----”\n\n“Oh, quit it!” cried a voice from the group. “You can't scare us,\nDerrick. That sort of talk was well enough once, but it don't go any\nmore. We want a yes or no answer.”\n\nIt was gone--that old-time power of mastery, that faculty of command.\nThe ground crumbled beneath his feet. Long since it had been, by his own\nhand, undermined. Authority was gone. Why keep up this miserable sham\nany longer? Could they not read the lie in his face, in his voice? What\na folly to maintain the wretched pretence! He had failed. He was ruined.\nHarran was gone. His ranch would soon go; his money was gone. Lyman\nwas worse than dead. His own honour had been prostituted. Gone, gone,\neverything he held dear, gone, lost, and swept away in that fierce\nstruggle. And suddenly and all in a moment the last remaining shells\nof the fabric of his being, the sham that had stood already wonderfully\nlong, cracked and collapsed.\n\n“Was the Commission honestly elected?” insisted Garnett. “Were the\ndelegates--did you bribe the delegates?”\n\n“We were obliged to shut our eyes to means,” faltered Magnus. “There\nwas no other way to--” Then suddenly and with the last dregs of his\nresolution, he concluded with: “Yes, I gave them two thousand dollars\neach.”\n\n“Oh, hell! Oh, my God!” exclaimed Keast, sitting swiftly down upon the\nragged sofa.\n\nThere was a long silence. A sense of poignant embarrassment descended\nupon those present. No one knew what to say or where to look. Garnett,\nwith a laboured attempt at nonchalance, murmured:\n\n“I see. Well, that's what I was trying to get at. Yes, I see.”\n\n“Well,” said Gethings at length, bestirring himself, “I guess I'LL go\nhome.”\n\nThere was a movement. The group broke up, the men making for the door.\nOne by one they went out. The last to go was Keast. He came up to Magnus\nand shook the Governor's limp hand.\n\n“Good-bye, Governor,” he said. “I'll see you again pretty soon. Don't\nlet this discourage you. They'll come around all right after a while. So\nlong.”\n\nHe went out, shutting the door.\n\nAnd seated in the one chair of the room, Magnus Derrick remained a long\ntime, looking at his face in the cracked mirror that for so many years\nhad reflected the painted faces of soubrettes, in this atmosphere of\nstale perfume and mouldy rice powder.\n\nIt had come--his fall, his ruin. After so many years of integrity and\nhonest battle, his life had ended here--in an actress's dressing-room,\ndeserted by his friends, his son murdered, his dishonesty known, an old\nman, broken, discarded, discredited, and abandoned. Before nightfall of\nthat day, Bonneville was further excited by an astonishing bit of news.\nS. Behrman lived in a detached house at some distance from the town,\nsurrounded by a grove of live oak and eucalyptus trees. At a little\nafter half-past six, as he was sitting down to his supper, a bomb was\nthrown through the window of his dining-room, exploding near the doorway\nleading into the hall. The room was wrecked and nearly every window\nof the house shattered. By a miracle, S. Behrman, himself, remained\nuntouched.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nOn a certain afternoon in the early part of July, about a month after\nthe fight at the irrigating ditch and the mass meeting at Bonneville,\nCedarquist, at the moment opening his mail in his office in San\nFrancisco, was genuinely surprised to receive a visit from Presley.\n\n“Well, upon my word, Pres,” exclaimed the manufacturer, as the young man\ncame in through the door that the office boy held open for him, “upon\nmy word, have you been sick? Sit down, my boy. Have a glass of sherry. I\nalways keep a bottle here.”\n\nPresley accepted the wine and sank into the depths of a great leather\nchair near by.\n\n“Sick?” he answered. “Yes, I have been sick. I'm sick now. I'm gone to\npieces, sir.”\n\nHis manner was the extreme of listlessness--the listlessness of great\nfatigue. “Well, well,” observed the other. “I'm right sorry to hear\nthat. What's the trouble, Pres?”\n\n“Oh, nerves mostly, I suppose, and my head, and insomnia, and\nweakness, a general collapse all along the line, the doctor tells\nme. 'Over-cerebration,' he says; 'over-excitement.' I fancy I rather\nnarrowly missed brain fever.”\n\n“Well, I can easily suppose it,” answered Cedarquist gravely, “after all\nyou have been through.”\n\nPresley closed his eyes--they were sunken in circles of dark brown\nflesh--and pressed a thin hand to the back of his head.\n\n“It is a nightmare,” he murmured. “A frightful nightmare, and it's not\nover yet. You have heard of it all only through the newspaper reports.\nBut down there, at Bonneville, at Los Muertos--oh, you can have no idea\nof it, of the misery caused by the defeat of the ranchers and by this\ndecision of the Supreme Court that dispossesses them all. We had gone on\nhoping to the last that we would win there. We had thought that in the\nSupreme Court of the United States, at least, we could find justice. And\nthe news of its decision was the worst, last blow of all. For Magnus it\nwas the last--positively the very last.”\n\n“Poor, poor Derrick,” murmured Cedarquist. “Tell me about him, Pres. How\ndoes he take it? What is he going to do?”\n\n“It beggars him, sir. He sunk a great deal more than any of us believed\nin his ranch, when he resolved to turn off most of the tenants and farm\nthe ranch himself. Then the fight he made against the Railroad in the\nCourts and the political campaign he went into, to get Lyman on\nthe Railroad Commission, took more of it. The money that Genslinger\nblackmailed him of, it seems, was about all he had left. He had been\ngambling--you know the Governor--on another bonanza crop this year to\nrecoup him. Well, the bonanza came right enough--just in time for S.\nBehrman and the Railroad to grab it. Magnus is ruined.”\n\n“What a tragedy! what a tragedy!” murmured the other. “Lyman turning\nrascal, Harran killed, and now this; and all within so short a time--all\nat the SAME time, you might almost say.”\n\n“If it had only killed him,” continued Presley; “but that is the worst\nof it.”\n\n“How the worst?”\n\n“I'm afraid, honestly, I'm afraid it is going to turn his wits,\nsir. It's broken him; oh, you should see him, you should see him. A\nshambling, stooping, trembling old man, in his dotage already. He sits\nall day in the dining-room, turning over papers, sorting them, tying\nthem up, opening them again, forgetting them--all fumbling and mumbling\nand confused. And at table sometimes he forgets to eat. And, listen,\nyou know, from the house we can hear the trains whistling for the Long\nTrestle. As often as that happens the Governor seems to be--oh, I don't\nknow, frightened. He will sink his head between his shoulders, as though\nhe were dodging something, and he won't fetch a long breath again till\nthe train is out of hearing. He seems to have conceived an abject,\nunreasoned terror of the Railroad.”\n\n“But he will have to leave Los Muertos now, of course?”\n\n“Yes, they will all have to leave. They have a fortnight more. The few\ntenants that were still on Los Muertos are leaving. That is one thing\nthat brings me to the city. The family of one of the men who was\nkilled--Hooven was his name--have come to the city to find work. I\nthink they are liable to be in great distress, unless they have been\nwonderfully lucky, and I am trying to find them in order to look after\nthem.”\n\n“You need looking after yourself, Pres.”\n\n“Oh, once away from Bonneville and the sight of the ruin there, I'm\nbetter. But I intend to go away. And that makes me think, I came to ask\nyou if you could help me. If you would let me take passage on one of\nyour wheat ships. The Doctor says an ocean voyage would set me up.”\n\n“Why, certainly, Pres,” declared Cedarquist. “But I'm sorry you'll have\nto go. We expected to have you down in the country with us this winter.”\n\nPresley shook his head. “No,” he answered. “I must go. Even if I had all\nmy health, I could not bring myself to stay in California just now. If\nyou can introduce me to one of your captains--”\n\n“With pleasure. When do you want to go? You may have to wait a few\nweeks. Our first ship won't clear till the end of the month.”\n\n“That would do very well. Thank you, sir.”\n\nBut Cedarquist was still interested in the land troubles of the\nBonneville farmers, and took the first occasion to ask:\n\n“So, the Railroad are in possession on most of the ranches?” “On all\nof them,” returned Presley. “The League went all to pieces, so soon as\nMagnus was forced to resign. The old story--they got quarrelling among\nthemselves. Somebody started a compromise party, and upon that issue\na new president was elected. Then there were defections. The Railroad\noffered to lease the lands in question to the ranchers--the ranchers\nwho owned them,” he exclaimed bitterly, “and because the terms were\nnominal--almost nothing--plenty of the men took the chance of saving\nthemselves. And, of course, once signing the lease, they acknowledged\nthe Railroad's title. But the road would not lease to Magnus. S. Behrman\ntakes over Los Muertos in a few weeks now.”\n\n“No doubt, the road made over their title in the property to him,”\n observed Cedarquist, “as a reward of his services.”\n\n“No doubt,” murmured Presley wearily. He rose to go.\n\n“By the way,” said Cedarquist, “what have you on hand for, let us say,\nFriday evening? Won't you dine with us then? The girls are going to the\ncountry Monday of next week, and you probably won't see them again for\nsome time if you take that ocean voyage of yours.”\n\n“I'm afraid I shall be very poor company, sir,” hazarded Presley.\n“There's no 'go,' no life in me at all these days. I am like a clock\nwith a broken spring.”\n\n“Not broken, Pres, my boy;” urged the other, “only run down. Try and see\nif we can't wind you up a bit. Say that we can expect you. We dine at\nseven.”\n\n“Thank you, sir. Till Friday at seven, then.”\n\nRegaining the street, Presley sent his valise to his club (where he had\nengaged a room) by a messenger boy, and boarded a Castro Street car.\nBefore leaving Bonneville, he had ascertained, by strenuous enquiry,\nMrs. Hooven's address in the city, and thitherward he now directed his\nsteps.\n\nWhen Presley had told Cedarquist that he was ill, that he was jaded,\nworn out, he had only told half the truth. Exhausted he was, nerveless,\nweak, but this apathy was still invaded from time to time with fierce\nincursions of a spirit of unrest and revolt, reactions, momentary\nreturns of the blind, undirected energy that at one time had prompted\nhim to a vast desire to acquit himself of some terrible deed of\nreadjustment, just what, he could not say, some terrifying martyrdom,\nsome awe-inspiring immolation, consummate, incisive, conclusive. He\nfancied himself to be fired with the purblind, mistaken heroism of the\nanarchist, hurling his victim to destruction with full knowledge that\nthe catastrophe shall sweep him also into the vortex it creates.\n\nBut his constitutional irresoluteness obstructed his path continually;\nbrain-sick, weak of will, emotional, timid even, he temporised,\nprocrastinated, brooded; came to decisions in the dark hours of the\nnight, only to abandon them in the morning.\n\nOnce only he had ACTED. And at this moment, as he was carried through\nthe windy, squalid streets, he trembled at the remembrance of it. The\nhorror of “what might have been” incompatible with the vengeance\nwhose minister he fancied he was, oppressed him. The scene perpetually\nreconstructed itself in his imagination. He saw himself under the shade\nof the encompassing trees and shrubbery, creeping on his belly toward\nthe house, in the suburbs of Bonneville, watching his chances, seizing\nopportunities, spying upon the lighted windows where the raised curtains\nafforded a view of the interior. Then had come the appearance in the\nglare of the gas of the figure of the man for whom he waited. He saw\nhimself rise and run forward. He remembered the feel and weight in his\nhand of Caraher's bomb--the six inches of plugged gas pipe. His upraised\narm shot forward. There was a shiver of smashed window-panes, then--a\nvoid--a red whirl of confusion, the air rent, the ground rocking,\nhimself flung headlong, flung off the spinning circumference of things\nout into a place of terror and vacancy and darkness. And then after a\nlong time the return of reason, the consciousness that his feet were set\nupon the road to Los Muertos, and that he was fleeing terror-stricken,\ngasping, all but insane with hysteria. Then the never-to-be-forgotten\nnight that ensued, when he descended into the pit, horrified at what\nhe supposed he had done, at one moment ridden with remorse, at another\nraging against his own feebleness, his lack of courage, his wretched,\nvacillating spirit. But morning had come, and with it the knowledge that\nhe had failed, and the baser assurance that he was not even remotely\nsuspected. His own escape had been no less miraculous than that of his\nenemy, and he had fallen on his knees in inarticulate prayer, weeping,\npouring out his thanks to God for the deliverance from the gulf to the\nvery brink of which his feet had been drawn.\n\nAfter this, however, there had come to Presley a deep-rooted suspicion\nthat he was--of all human beings, the most wretched--a failure.\nEverything to which he had set his mind failed--his great epic, his\nefforts to help the people who surrounded him, even his attempted\ndestruction of the enemy, all these had come to nothing. Girding his\nshattered strength together, he resolved upon one last attempt to live\nup to the best that was in him, and to that end had set himself to lift\nout of the despair into which they had been thrust, the bereaved family\nof the German, Hooven.\n\nAfter all was over, and Hooven, together with the seven others who had\nfallen at the irrigating ditch, was buried in the Bonneville cemetery,\nMrs. Hooven, asking no one's aid or advice, and taking with her Minna\nand little Hilda, had gone to San Francisco--had gone to find work,\nabandoning Los Muertos and her home forever. Presley only learned of the\ndeparture of the family after fifteen days had elapsed.\n\nAt once, however, the suspicion forced itself upon him that Mrs.\nHooven--and Minna, too for the matter of that--country-bred, ignorant of\ncity ways, might easily come to grief in the hard, huge struggle of city\nlife. This suspicion had swiftly hardened to a conviction, acting at\nlast upon which Presley had followed them to San Francisco, bent upon\nfinding and assisting them.\n\nThe house to which Presley was led by the address in his memorandum book\nwas a cheap but fairly decent hotel near the power house of the Castro\nStreet cable. He inquired for Mrs. Hooven.\n\nThe landlady recollected the Hoovens perfectly.\n\n“German woman, with a little girl-baby, and an older daughter, sure.\nThe older daughter was main pretty. Sure I remember them, but they ain't\nhere no more. They left a week ago. I had to ask them for their room.\nAs it was, they owed a week's room-rent. Mister, I can't afford----”\n\n“Well, do you know where they went? Did you hear what address they had\ntheir trunk expressed to?”\n\n“Ah, yes, their trunk,” vociferated the woman, clapping her hands to her\nhips, her face purpling. “Their trunk, ah, sure. I got their trunk, and\nwhat are you going to do about it? I'm holding it till I get my money.\nWhat have you got to say about it? Let's hear it.”\n\nPresley turned away with a gesture of discouragement, his heart sinking.\nOn the street corner he stood for a long time, frowning in trouble and\nperplexity. His suspicions had been only too well founded. So long ago\nas a week, the Hoovens had exhausted all their little store of money.\nFor seven days now they had been without resources, unless, indeed, work\nhad been found; “and what,” he asked himself, “what work in God's name\ncould they find to do here in the city?”\n\nSeven days! He quailed at the thought of it. Seven days without money,\nknowing not a soul in all that swarming city. Ignorant of city life as\nboth Minna and her mother were, would they even realise that there were\ninstitutions built and generously endowed for just such as they? He\nknew them to have their share of pride, the dogged sullen pride of the\npeasant; even if they knew of charitable organisations, would they,\ncould they bring themselves to apply there? A poignant anxiety thrust\nitself sharply into Presley's heart. Where were they now? Where had they\nslept last night? Where breakfasted this morning? Had there even been\nany breakfast this morning? Had there even been any bed last night?\nLost, and forgotten in the plexus of the city's life, what had befallen\nthem? Towards what fate was the ebb tide of the streets drifting them?\n\nWas this to be still another theme wrought out by iron hands upon the\nold, the world-old, world-wide keynote? How far were the consequences\nof that dreadful day's work at the irrigating ditch to reach? To what\nlength was the tentacle of the monster to extend?\n\nPresley returned toward the central, the business quarter of the city,\nalternately formulating and dismissing from his mind plan after plan\nfor the finding and aiding of Mrs. Hooven and her daughters. He reached\nMontgomery Street, and turned toward his club, his imagination once more\nreviewing all the causes and circumstances of the great battle of which\nfor the last eighteen months he had been witness.\n\nAll at once he paused, his eye caught by a sign affixed to the wall just\ninside the street entrance of a huge office building, and smitten with\nan idea, stood for an instant motionless, upon the sidewalk, his eyes\nwide, his fists shut tight.\n\nThe building contained the General Office of the Pacific and\nSouthwestern Railroad. Large though it was, it nevertheless, was not\npretentious, and during his visits to the city, Presley must have passed\nit, unheeding, many times.\n\nBut for all that it was the stronghold of the enemy--the centre of all\nthat vast ramifying system of arteries that drained the life-blood\nof the State; the nucleus of the web in which so many lives, so many\nfortunes, so many destinies had been enmeshed. From this place--so he\ntold himself--had emanated that policy of extortion, oppression and\ninjustice that little by little had shouldered the ranchers from their\nrights, till, their backs to the wall, exasperated and despairing they\nhad turned and fought and died. From here had come the orders to S.\nBehrman, to Cyrus Ruggles and to Genslinger, the orders that had brought\nDyke to a prison, that had killed Annixter, that had ruined Magnus, that\nhad corrupted Lyman. Here was the keep of the castle, and here, behind\none of those many windows, in one of those many offices, his hand upon\nthe levers of his mighty engine, sat the master, Shelgrim himself.\n\nInstantly, upon the realisation of this fact an ungovernable desire\nseized upon Presley, an inordinate curiosity. Why not see, face to face,\nthe man whose power was so vast, whose will was so resistless, whose\npotency for evil so limitless, the man who for so long and so\nhopelessly they had all been fighting. By reputation he knew him to\nbe approachable; why should he not then approach him? Presley took his\nresolution in both hands. If he failed to act upon this impulse, he knew\nhe would never act at all. His heart beating, his breath coming short,\nhe entered the building, and in a few moments found himself seated in an\nante-room, his eyes fixed with hypnotic intensity upon the frosted pane\nof an adjoining door, whereon in gold letters was inscribed the word,\n“PRESIDENT.”\n\nIn the end, Presley had been surprised to find that Shelgrim was still\nin. It was already very late, after six o'clock, and the other offices\nin the building were in the act of closing. Many of them were already\ndeserted. At every instant, through the open door of the ante-room,\nhe caught a glimpse of clerks, office boys, book-keepers, and other\nemployees hurrying towards the stairs and elevators, quitting business\nfor the day. Shelgrim, it seemed, still remained at his desk, knowing no\nfatigue, requiring no leisure.\n\n“What time does Mr. Shelgrim usually go home?” inquired Presley of the\nyoung man who sat ruling forms at the table in the ante-room.\n\n“Anywhere between half-past six and seven,” the other answered, adding,\n“Very often he comes back in the evening.”\n\nAnd the man was seventy years old. Presley could not repress a murmur of\nastonishment. Not only mentally, then, was the President of the P. and\nS. W. a giant. Seventy years of age and still at his post, holding there\nwith the energy, with a concentration of purpose that would have wrecked\nthe health and impaired the mind of many men in the prime of their\nmanhood.\n\nBut the next instant Presley set his teeth.\n\n“It is an ogre's vitality,” he said to himself. “Just so is the\nman-eating tiger strong. The man should have energy who has sucked the\nlife-blood from an entire People.”\n\nA little electric bell on the wall near at hand trilled a warning. The\nyoung man who was ruling forms laid down his pen, and opening the\ndoor of the President's office, thrust in his head, then after a word\nexchanged with the unseen occupant of the room, he swung the door wide,\nsaying to Presley:\n\n“Mr. Shelgrim will see you, sir.”\n\nPresley entered a large, well lighted, but singularly barren office. A\nwell-worn carpet was on the floor, two steel engravings hung against the\nwall, an extra chair or two stood near a large, plain, littered table.\nThat was absolutely all, unless he excepted the corner wash-stand,\non which was set a pitcher of ice water, covered with a clean, stiff\nnapkin. A man, evidently some sort of manager's assistant, stood at the\nend of the table, leaning on the back of one of the chairs. Shelgrim\nhimself sat at the table.\n\nHe was large, almost to massiveness. An iron-grey beard and a mustache\nthat completely hid the mouth covered the lower part of his face. His\neyes were a pale blue, and a little watery; here and there upon his face\nwere moth spots. But the enormous breadth of the shoulders was what, at\nfirst, most vividly forced itself upon Presley's notice. Never had\nhe seen a broader man; the neck, however, seemed in a manner to have\nsettled into the shoulders, and furthermore they were humped and\nrounded, as if to bear great responsibilities, and great abuse.\n\nAt the moment he was wearing a silk skull-cap, pushed to one side and\na little awry, a frock coat of broadcloth, with long sleeves, and a\nwaistcoat from the lower buttons of which the cloth was worn and, upon\nthe edges, rubbed away, showing the metal underneath. At the top this\nwaistcoat was unbuttoned and in the shirt front disclosed were two pearl\nstuds.\n\nPresley, uninvited, unnoticed apparently, sat down. The assistant\nmanager was in the act of making a report. His voice was not lowered,\nand Presley heard every word that was spoken.\n\nThe report proved interesting. It concerned a book-keeper in the\noffice of the auditor of disbursements. It seems he was at most times\nthoroughly reliable, hard-working, industrious, ambitious. But at long\nintervals the vice of drunkenness seized upon the man and for three days\nrode him like a hag. Not only during the period of this intemperance,\nbut for the few days immediately following, the man was useless, his\nwork untrustworthy. He was a family man and earnestly strove to rid\nhimself of his habit; he was, when sober, valuable. In consideration of\nthese facts, he had been pardoned again and again.\n\n“You remember, Mr. Shelgrim,” observed the manager, “that you have more\nthan once interfered in his behalf, when we were disposed to let him go.\nI don't think we can do anything with him, sir. He promises to reform\ncontinually, but it is the same old story. This last time we saw nothing\nof him for four days. Honestly, Mr. Shelgrim, I think we ought to let\nTentell out. We can't afford to keep him. He is really losing us too\nmuch money. Here's the order ready now, if you care to let it go.”\n\nThere was a pause. Presley all attention, listened breathlessly. The\nassistant manager laid before his President the typewritten order in\nquestion. The silence lengthened; in the hall outside, the wrought-iron\ndoor of the elevator cage slid to with a clash. Shelgrim did not look at\nthe order. He turned his swivel chair about and faced the windows behind\nhim, looking out with unseeing eyes. At last he spoke:\n\n“Tentell has a family, wife and three children. How much do we pay him?”\n\n“One hundred and thirty.”\n\n“Let's double that, or say two hundred and fifty. Let's see how that\nwill do.”\n\n“Why--of course--if you say so, but really, Mr. Shelgrim”\n\n“Well, we'll try that, anyhow.”\n\nPresley had not time to readjust his perspective to this new point of\nview of the President of the P. and S. W. before the assistant manager\nhad withdrawn. Shelgrim wrote a few memoranda on his calendar pad, and\nsigned a couple of letters before turning his attention to Presley. At\nlast, he looked up and fixed the young man with a direct, grave glance.\nHe did not smile. It was some time before he spoke. At last, he said:\n\n“Well, sir.”\n\nPresley advanced and took a chair nearer at hand. Shelgrim turned and\nfrom his desk picked up and consulted Presley's card. Presley observed\nthat he read without the use of glasses.\n\n“You,” he said, again facing about, “you are the young man who wrote the\npoem called 'The Toilers.'”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“It seems to have made a great deal of talk. I've read it, and I've seen\nthe picture in Cedarquist's house, the picture you took the idea from.”\n\nPresley, his senses never more alive, observed that, curiously enough,\nShelgrim did not move his body. His arms moved, and his head, but\nthe great bulk of the man remained immobile in its place, and as the\ninterview proceeded and this peculiarity emphasised itself, Presley\nbegan to conceive the odd idea that Shelgrim had, as it were, placed his\nbody in the chair to rest, while his head and brain and hands went\non working independently. A saucer of shelled filberts stood near his\nelbow, and from time to time he picked up one of these in a great thumb\nand forefinger and put it between his teeth.\n\n“I've seen the picture called 'The Toilers,'” continued Shelgrim, “and\nof the two, I like the picture better than the poem.”\n\n“The picture is by a master,” Presley hastened to interpose.\n\n“And for that reason,” said Shelgrim, “it leaves nothing more to be\nsaid. You might just as well have kept quiet. There's only one best way\nto say anything. And what has made the picture of 'The Toilers' great is\nthat the artist said in it the BEST that could be said on the subject.”\n\n“I had never looked at it in just that light,” observed Presley. He\nwas confused, all at sea, embarrassed. What he had expected to find in\nShelgrim, he could not have exactly said. But he had been prepared\nto come upon an ogre, a brute, a terrible man of blood and iron, and\ninstead had discovered a sentimentalist and an art critic. No standards\nof measurement in his mental equipment would apply to the actual man,\nand it began to dawn upon him that possibly it was not because these\nstandards were different in kind, but that they were lamentably\ndeficient in size. He began to see that here was the man not only great,\nbut large; many-sided, of vast sympathies, who understood with equal\nintelligence, the human nature in an habitual drunkard, the ethics of\na masterpiece of painting, and the financiering and operation of ten\nthousand miles of railroad.\n\n“I had never looked at it in just that light,” repeated Presley. “There\nis a great deal in what you say.”\n\n“If I am to listen,” continued Shelgrim, “to that kind of talk, I prefer\nto listen to it first hand. I would rather listen to what the great\nFrench painter has to say, than to what YOU have to say about what he\nhas already said.”\n\nHis speech, loud and emphatic at first, when the idea of what he had to\nsay was fresh in his mind, lapsed and lowered itself at the end of his\nsentences as though he had already abandoned and lost interest in that\nthought, so that the concluding words were indistinct, beneath the grey\nbeard and mustache. Also at times there was the faintest suggestion of a\nlisp.\n\n“I wrote that poem,” hazarded Presley, “at a time when I was terribly\nupset. I live,” he concluded, “or did live on the Los Muertos ranch in\nTulare County--Magnus Derrick's ranch.”\n\n“The Railroad's ranch LEASED to Mr. Derrick,” observed Shelgrim.\n\nPresley spread out his hands with a helpless, resigned gesture.\n\n“And,” continued the President of the P. and S. W. with grave intensity,\nlooking at Presley keenly, “I suppose you believe I am a grand old\nrascal.”\n\n“I believe,” answered Presley, “I am persuaded----” He hesitated,\nsearching for his words.\n\n“Believe this, young man,” exclaimed Shelgrim, laying a thick powerful\nforefinger on the table to emphasise his words, “try to believe this--to\nbegin with--THAT RAILROADS BUILD THEMSELVES. Where there is a demand\nsooner or later there will be a supply. Mr. Derrick, does he grow his\nwheat? The Wheat grows itself. What does he count for? Does he supply\nthe force? What do I count for? Do I build the Railroad? You are dealing\nwith forces, young man, when you speak of Wheat and the Railroads, not\nwith men. There is the Wheat, the supply. It must be carried to feed\nthe People. There is the demand. The Wheat is one force, the Railroad,\nanother, and there is the law that governs them--supply and demand. Men\nhave only little to do in the whole business. Complications may arise,\nconditions that bear hard on the individual--crush him maybe--BUT THE\nWHEAT WILL BE CARRIED TO FEED THE PEOPLE as inevitably as it will grow.\nIf you want to fasten the blame of the affair at Los Muertos on any one\nperson, you will make a mistake. Blame conditions, not men.”\n\n“But--but,” faltered Presley, “you are the head, you control the road.”\n\n“You are a very young man. Control the road! Can I stop it? I can\ngo into bankruptcy if you like. But otherwise if I run my road, as a\nbusiness proposition, I can do nothing. I can not control it. It is\na force born out of certain conditions, and I--no man--can stop it or\ncontrol it. Can your Mr. Derrick stop the Wheat growing? He can burn his\ncrop, or he can give it away, or sell it for a cent a bushel--just as I\ncould go into bankruptcy--but otherwise his Wheat must grow. Can any one\nstop the Wheat? Well, then no more can I stop the Road.”\n\nPresley regained the street stupefied, his brain in a whirl. This new\nidea, this new conception dumfounded him. Somehow, he could not deny\nit. It rang with the clear reverberation of truth. Was no one, then, to\nblame for the horror at the irrigating ditch? Forces, conditions,\nlaws of supply and demand--were these then the enemies, after all? Not\nenemies; there was no malevolence in Nature. Colossal indifference\nonly, a vast trend toward appointed goals. Nature was, then, a gigantic\nengine, a vast cyclopean power, huge, terrible, a leviathan with a heart\nof steel, knowing no compunction, no forgiveness, no tolerance; crushing\nout the human atom standing in its way, with nirvanic calm, the agony of\ndestruction sending never a jar, never the faintest tremour through all\nthat prodigious mechanism of wheels and cogs. He went to his club and\nate his supper alone, in gloomy agitation. He was sombre, brooding, lost\nin a dark maze of gloomy reflections. However, just as he was rising\nfrom the table an incident occurred that for the moment roused him and\nsharply diverted his mind.\n\nHis table had been placed near a window and as he was sipping his\nafter-dinner coffee, he happened to glance across the street. His eye\nwas at once caught by the sight of a familiar figure. Was it Minna\nHooven? The figure turned the street corner and was lost to sight; but\nit had been strangely like. On the moment, Presley had risen from the\ntable and, clapping on his hat, had hurried into the streets, where the\nlamps were already beginning to shine.\n\nBut search though he would, Presley could not again come upon the young\nwoman, in whom he fancied he had seen the daughter of the unfortunate\nGerman. At last, he gave up the hunt, and returning to his club--at this\nhour almost deserted--smoked a few cigarettes, vainly attempted to\nread from a volume of essays in the library, and at last, nervous,\ndistraught, exhausted, retired to his bed.\n\nBut none the less, Presley had not been mistaken. The girl whom he had\ntried to follow had been indeed Minna Hooven.\n\nWhen Minna, a week before this time, had returned to the lodging house\non Castro Street, after a day's unsuccessful effort to find employment,\nand was told that her mother and Hilda had gone, she was struck\nspeechless with surprise and dismay. She had never before been in any\ntown larger than Bonneville, and now knew not which way to turn nor how\nto account for the disappearance of her mother and little Hilda. That\nthe landlady was on the point of turning them out, she understood, but\nit had been agreed that the family should be allowed to stay yet one\nmore day, in the hope that Minna would find work. Of this she reminded\nthe land-lady. But this latter at once launched upon her such a torrent\nof vituperation, that the girl was frightened to speechless submission.\n\n“Oh, oh,” she faltered, “I know. I am sorry. I know we owe you money,\nbut where did my mother go? I only want to find her.”\n\n“Oh, I ain't going to be bothered,” shrilled the other. “How do I know?”\n\nThe truth of the matter was that Mrs. Hooven, afraid to stay in the\nvicinity of the house, after her eviction, and threatened with arrest by\nthe landlady if she persisted in hanging around, had left with the\nwoman a note scrawled on an old blotter, to be given to Minna when\nshe returned. This the landlady had lost. To cover her confusion, she\naffected a vast indignation, and a turbulent, irascible demeanour.\n\n“I ain't going to be bothered with such cattle as you,” she vociferated\nin Minna's face. “I don't know where your folks is. Me, I only have\ndealings with honest people. I ain't got a word to say so long as the\nrent is paid. But when I'm soldiered out of a week's lodging, then I'm\ndone. You get right along now. I don't know you. I ain't going to have\nmy place get a bad name by having any South of Market Street chippies\nhanging around. You get along, or I'll call an officer.”\n\nMinna sought the street, her head in a whirl. It was about five o'clock.\nIn her pocket was thirty-five cents, all she had in the world. What now?\n\nAll at once, the Terror of the City, that blind, unreasoned fear that\nonly the outcast knows, swooped upon her, and clutched her vulture-wise,\nby the throat.\n\nHer first few days' experience in the matter of finding employment, had\ntaught her just what she might expect from this new world upon which she\nhad been thrown. What was to become of her? What was she to do, where\nwas she to go? Unanswerable, grim questions, and now she no longer had\nherself to fear for. Her mother and the baby, little Hilda, both of them\nequally unable to look after themselves, what was to become of them,\nwhere were they gone? Lost, lost, all of them, herself as well. But she\nrallied herself, as she walked along. The idea of her starving, of her\nmother and Hilda starving, was out of all reason. Of course, it would\nnot come to that, of course not. It was not thus that starvation came.\nSomething would happen, of course, it would--in time. But meanwhile,\nmeanwhile, how to get through this approaching night, and the next few\ndays. That was the thing to think of just now.\n\nThe suddenness of it all was what most unnerved her. During all the\nnineteen years of her life, she had never known what it meant to shift\nfor herself. Her father had always sufficed for the family; he had taken\ncare of her, then, all of a sudden, her father had been killed, her\nmother snatched from her. Then all of a sudden there was no help\nanywhere. Then all of a sudden a terrible voice demanded of her, “Now\njust what can you do to keep yourself alive?” Life faced her; she looked\nthe huge stone image squarely in the lustreless eyes.\n\nIt was nearly twilight. Minna, for the sake of avoiding observation--for\nit seemed to her that now a thousand prying glances followed\nher--assumed a matter-of-fact demeanour, and began to walk briskly\ntoward the business quarter of the town.\n\nShe was dressed neatly enough, in a blue cloth skirt with a blue plush\nbelt, fairly decent shoes, once her mother's, a pink shirt waist, and\njacket and a straw sailor. She was, in an unusual fashion, pretty. Even\nher troubles had not dimmed the bright light of her pale, greenish-blue\neyes, nor faded the astonishing redness of her lips, nor hollowed her\nstrangely white face. Her blue-black hair was trim. She carried her\nwell-shaped, well-rounded figure erectly. Even in her distress, she\nobserved that men looked keenly at her, and sometimes after her as she\nwent along. But this she noted with a dim sub-conscious faculty. The\nreal Minna, harassed, terrified, lashed with a thousand anxieties, kept\nmurmuring under her breath:\n\n“What shall I do, what shall I do, oh, what shall I do, now?”\n\nAfter an interminable walk, she gained Kearney Street, and held it till\nthe well-lighted, well-kept neighbourhood of the shopping district\ngave place to the vice-crowded saloons and concert halls of the Barbary\nCoast. She turned aside in avoidance of this, only to plunge into the\npurlieus of Chinatown, whence only she emerged, panic-stricken and out\nof breath, after a half hour of never-to-be-forgotten terrors, and at a\ntime when it had grown quite dark.\n\nOn the corner of California and Dupont streets, she stood a long moment,\npondering.\n\n“I MUST do something,” she said to herself. “I must do SOMETHING.” She\nwas tired out by now, and the idea occurred to her to enter the Catholic\nchurch in whose shadow she stood, and sit down and rest. This she did.\nThe evening service was just being concluded. But long after the priests\nand altar boys had departed from the chancel, Minna still sat in the\ndim, echoing interior, confronting her desperate situation as best she\nmight.\n\nTwo or three hours later, the sexton woke her. The church was being\nclosed; she must leave. Once more, chilled with the sharp night air,\nnumb with long sitting in the same attitude, still oppressed with\ndrowsiness, confused, frightened, Minna found herself on the pavement.\nShe began to be hungry, and, at length, yielding to the demand that\nevery moment grew more imperious, bought and eagerly devoured a\nfive-cent bag of fruit. Then, once more she took up the round of\nwalking.\n\nAt length, in an obscure street that branched from Kearney Street, near\nthe corner of the Plaza, she came upon an illuminated sign, bearing the\ninscription, “Beds for the Night, 15 and 25 cents.”\n\nFifteen cents! Could she afford it? It would leave her with only that\nmuch more, that much between herself and a state of privation of which\nshe dared not think; and, besides, the forbidding look of the building\nfrightened her. It was dark, gloomy, dirty, a place suggestive of\nobscure crimes and hidden terrors. For twenty minutes or half an hour,\nshe hesitated, walking twice and three times around the block. At last,\nshe made up her mind. Exhaustion such as she had never known, weighed\nlike lead upon her shoulders and dragged at her heels. She must sleep.\nShe could not walk the streets all night. She entered the door-way under\nthe sign, and found her way up a filthy flight of stairs. At the top, a\nman in a blue checked “jumper” was filling a lamp behind a high desk. To\nhim Minna applied.\n\n“I should like,” she faltered, “to have a room--a bed for the night. One\nof those for fifteen cents will be good enough, I think.”\n\n“Well, this place is only for men,” said the man, looking up from the\nlamp.\n\n“Oh,” said Minna, “oh--I--I didn't know.”\n\nShe looked at him stupidly, and he, with equal stupidity, returned the\ngaze. Thus, for a long moment, they held each other's eyes.\n\n“I--I didn't know,” repeated Minna.\n\n“Yes, it's for men,” repeated the other. She slowly descended the\nstairs, and once more came out upon the streets.\n\nAnd upon those streets that, as the hours advanced, grew more and more\ndeserted, more and more silent, more and more oppressive with the\nsense of the bitter hardness of life towards those who have no means of\nliving, Minna Hooven spent the first night of her struggle to keep\nher head above the ebb-tide of the city's sea, into which she had been\nplunged.\n\nMorning came, and with it renewed hunger. At this time, she had found\nher way uptown again, and towards ten o'clock was sitting upon a bench\nin a little park full of nurse-maids and children. A group of the maids\ndrew their baby-buggies to Minna's bench, and sat down, continuing a\nconversation they had already begun. Minna listened. A friend of one of\nthe maids had suddenly thrown up her position, leaving her “madame” in\nwhat would appear to have been deserved embarrassment.\n\n“Oh,” said Minna, breaking in, and lying with sudden unwonted fluency,\n“I am a nurse-girl. I am out of a place. Do you think I could get that\none?”\n\nThe group turned and fixed her--so evidently a country girl--with a\nsupercilious indifference.\n\n“Well, you might try,” said one of them. “Got good references?”\n\n“References?” repeated Minna blankly. She did not know what this meant.\n\n“Oh, Mrs. Field ain't the kind to stick about references,” spoke up the\nother, “she's that soft. Why, anybody could work her.”\n\n“I'll go there,” said Minna. “Have you the address?” It was told to her.\n\n“Lorin,” she murmured. “Is that out of town?”\n\n“Well, it's across the Bay.”\n\n“Across the Bay.”\n\n“Um. You're from the country, ain't you?”\n\n“Yes. How--how do I get there? Is it far?”\n\n“Well, you take the ferry at the foot of Market Street, and then the\ntrain on the other side. No, it ain't very far. Just ask any one down\nthere. They'll tell you.”\n\nIt was a chance; but Minna, after walking down to the ferry slips, found\nthat the round trip would cost her twenty cents. If the journey\nproved fruitless, only a dime would stand between her and the end\nof everything. But it was a chance; the only one that had, as yet,\npresented itself. She made the trip.\n\nAnd upon the street-railway cars, upon the ferryboats, on the\nlocomotives and way-coaches of the local trains, she was reminded of\nher father's death, and of the giant power that had reduced her to her\npresent straits, by the letters, P. and S. W. R. R. To her mind, they\noccurred everywhere. She seemed to see them in every direction. She\nfancied herself surrounded upon every hand by the long arms of the\nmonster.\n\nMinute after minute, her hunger gnawed at her. She could not keep\nher mind from it. As she sat on the boat, she found herself curiously\nscanning the faces of the passengers, wondering how long since such\na one had breakfasted, how long before this other should sit down to\nlunch.\n\nWhen Minna descended from the train, at Lorin on the other side of the\nBay, she found that the place was one of those suburban towns, not yet\nbecome fashionable, such as may be seen beyond the outskirts of any\nlarge American city. All along the line of the railroad thereabouts,\nhouses, small villas--contractors' ventures--were scattered, the\nadvantages of suburban lots and sites for homes being proclaimed in\nseven-foot letters upon mammoth bill-boards close to the right of\nway. Without much trouble, Minna found the house to which she had been\ndirected, a pretty little cottage, set back from the street and shaded\nby palms, live oaks, and the inevitable eucalyptus. Her heart warmed at\nthe sight of it. Oh, to find a little niche for herself here, a home,\na refuge from those horrible city streets, from the rat of famine, with\nits relentless tooth. How she would work, how strenuously she would\nendeavour to please, how patient of rebuke she would be, how faithful,\nhow conscientious. Nor were her pretensions altogether false; upon her,\nwhile at home, had devolved almost continually the care of the baby\nHilda, her little sister. She knew the wants and needs of children.\n\nHer heart beating, her breath failing, she rang the bell set squarely in\nthe middle of the front door.\n\nThe lady of the house herself, an elderly lady, with pleasant, kindly\nface, opened the door. Minna stated her errand.\n\n“But I have already engaged a girl,” she said.\n\n“Oh,” murmured Minna, striving with all her might to maintain\nappearances. “Oh--I thought perhaps--” She turned away.\n\n“I'm sorry,” said the lady. Then she added, “Would you care to look\nafter so many as three little children, and help around in light\nhousework between whiles?”\n\n“Yes, ma'am.” “Because my sister--she lives in North Berkeley, above\nhere--she's looking far a girl. Have you had lots of experience? Got\ngood references?”\n\n“Yes, ma'am.”\n\n“Well, I'll give you the address. She lives up in North Berkeley.”\n\nShe turned back into the house a moment, and returned, handing Minna a\ncard.\n\n“That's where she lives--careful not to BLOT it, child, the ink's wet\nyet--you had better see her.”\n\n“Is it far? Could I walk there?”\n\n“My, no; you better take the electric cars, about six blocks above\nhere.”\n\nWhen Minna arrived in North Berkeley, she had no money left. By a cruel\nmistake, she had taken a car going in the wrong direction, and though\nher error was rectified easily enough, it had cost her her last\nfive-cent piece. She was now to try her last hope. Promptly it crumbled\naway. Like the former, this place had been already filled, and Minna\nleft the door of the house with the certainty that her chance had\ncome to naught, and that now she entered into the last struggle with\nlife--the death struggle--shorn of her last pitiful defence, her last\nsafeguard, her last penny.\n\nAs she once more resumed her interminable walk, she realised she\nwas weak, faint; and she knew that it was the weakness of complete\nexhaustion, and the faintness of approaching starvation. Was this the\nend coming on? Terror of death aroused her.\n\n“I MUST, I MUST do something, oh, anything. I must have something to\neat.”\n\nAt this late hour, the idea of pawning her little jacket occurred to\nher, but now she was far away from the city and its pawnshops, and there\nwas no getting back.\n\nShe walked on. An hour passed. She lost her sense of direction, became\nconfused, knew not where she was going, turned corners and went up\nby-streets without knowing why, anything to keep moving, for she fancied\nthat so soon as she stood still, the rat in the pit of her stomach\ngnawed more eagerly.\n\nAt last, she entered what seemed to be, if not a park, at least\nsome sort of public enclosure. There were many trees; the place was\nbeautiful; well-kept roads and walks led sinuously and invitingly\nunderneath the shade. Through the trees upon the other side of a wide\nexpanse of turf, brown and sear under the summer sun, she caught a\nglimpse of tall buildings and a flagstaff. The whole place had a vaguely\npublic, educational appearance, and Minna guessed, from certain notices\naffixed to the trees, warning the public against the picking of flowers,\nthat she had found her way into the grounds of the State University. She\nwent on a little further. The path she was following led her, at length,\ninto a grove of gigantic live oaks, whose lower branches all but swept\nthe ground. Here the grass was green, the few flowers in bloom, the\nshade very thick. A more lovely spot she had seldom seen. Near at hand\nwas a bench, built around the trunk of the largest live oak, and here,\nat length, weak from hunger, exhausted to the limits of her endurance,\ndespairing, abandoned, Minna Hooven sat down to enquire of herself what\nnext she could do.\n\nBut once seated, the demands of the animal--so she could believe--became\nmore clamorous, more insistent. To eat, to rest, to be safely housed\nagainst another night, above all else, these were the things she craved;\nand the craving within her grew so mighty that she crisped her poor,\nstarved hands into little fists, in an agony of desire, while the tears\nran from her eyes, and the sobs rose thick from her breast and struggled\nand strangled in her aching throat.\n\nBut in a few moments Minna was aware that a woman, apparently of some\nthirty years of age, had twice passed along the walk in front of the\nbench where she sat, and now, as she took more notice of her, she\nremembered that she had seen her on the ferry-boat coming over from the\ncity.\n\nThe woman was gowned in silk, tightly corseted, and wore a hat of rather\nostentatious smartness. Minna became convinced that the person was\nwatching her, but before she had a chance to act upon this conviction\nshe was surprised out of all countenance by the stranger coming up to\nwhere she sat and speaking to her.\n\n“Here is a coincidence,” exclaimed the new-comer, as she sat down;\n“surely you are the young girl who sat opposite me on the boat. Strange\nI should come across you again. I've had you in mind ever since.”\n\nOn this nearer view Minna observed that the woman's face bore\nrather more than a trace of enamel and that the atmosphere about was\nimpregnated with sachet. She was not otherwise conspicuous, but there\nwas a certain hardness about her mouth and a certain droop of fatigue\nin her eyelids which, combined with an indefinite self-confidence of\nmanner, held Minna's attention.\n\n“Do you know,” continued the woman, “I believe you are in trouble. I\nthought so when I saw you on the boat, and I think so now. Are you? Are\nyou in trouble? You're from the country, ain't you?”\n\nMinna, glad to find a sympathiser, even in this chance acquaintance,\nadmitted that she was in distress; that she had become separated from\nher mother, and that she was indeed from the country.\n\n“I've been trying to find a situation,” she hazarded in conclusion,\n“but I don't seem to succeed. I've never been in a city before, except\nBonneville.”\n\n“Well, it IS a coincidence,” said the other. “I know I wasn't drawn to\nyou for nothing. I am looking for just such a young girl as you. You\nsee, I live alone a good deal and I've been wanting to find a nice,\nbright, sociable girl who will be a sort of COMPANION to me. Understand?\nAnd there's something about you that I like. I took to you the moment I\nsaw you on the boat. Now shall we talk this over?”\n\nTowards the end of the week, one afternoon, as Presley was returning\nfrom his club, he came suddenly face to face with Minna upon a street\ncorner.\n\n“Ah,” he cried, coming toward her joyfully. “Upon my word, I had almost\ngiven you up. I've been looking everywhere for you. I was afraid you\nmight not be getting along, and I wanted to see if there was anything\nI could do. How are your mother and Hilda? Where are you stopping? Have\nyou got a good place?”\n\n“I don't know where mamma is,” answered Minna. “We got separated, and I\nnever have been able to find her again.”\n\nMeanwhile, Presley had been taking in with a quick eye the details of\nMinna's silk dress, with its garniture of lace, its edging of velvet,\nits silver belt-buckle. Her hair was arranged in a new way and on her\nhead was a wide hat with a flare to one side, set off with a gilt buckle\nand a puff of bright blue plush. He glanced at her sharply.\n\n“Well, but--but how are you getting on?” he demanded.\n\nMinna laughed scornfully.\n\n“I?” she cried. “Oh, I'VE gone to hell. It was either that or\nstarvation.”\n\nPresley regained his room at the club, white and trembling. Worse than\nthe worst he had feared had happened. He had not been soon enough to\nhelp. He had failed again. A superstitious fear assailed him that he\nwas, in a manner, marked; that he was foredoomed to fail. Minna had\ncome--had been driven to this; and he, acting too late upon his tardy\nresolve, had not been able to prevent it. Were the horrors, then, never\nto end? Was the grisly spectre of consequence to forever dance in his\nvision? Were the results, the far-reaching results of that battle at\nthe irrigating ditch to cross his path forever? When would the affair\nbe terminated, the incident closed? Where was that spot to which the\ntentacle of the monster could not reach?\n\nBy now, he was sick with the dread of it all. He wanted to get away, to\nbe free from that endless misery, so that he might not see what he\ncould no longer help. Cowardly he now knew himself to be. He thought of\nhimself only with loathing.\n\nBitterly self-contemptuous that he could bring himself to a\nparticipation in such trivialities, he began to dress to keep his\nengagement to dine with the Cedarquists.\n\nHe arrived at the house nearly half an hour late, but before he could\ntake off his overcoat, Mrs. Cedarquist appeared in the doorway of the\ndrawing-room at the end of the hall. She was dressed as if to go out.\n\n“My DEAR Presley,” she exclaimed, her stout, over-dressed body bustling\ntoward him with a great rustle of silk. “I never was so glad. You poor,\ndear poet, you are thin as a ghost. You need a better dinner than I can\ngive you, and that is just what you are to have.”\n\n“Have I blundered?” Presley hastened to exclaim. “Did not Mr. Cedarquist\nmention Friday evening?”\n\n“No, no, no,” she cried; “it was he who blundered. YOU blundering in\na social amenity! Preposterous! No; Mr. Cedarquist forgot that we were\ndining out ourselves to-night, and when he told me he had asked you\nhere for the same evening, I fell upon the man, my dear, I did actually,\ntooth and nail. But I wouldn't hear of his wiring you. I just dropped\na note to our hostess, asking if I could not bring you, and when I told\nher who you WERE, she received the idea with, oh, empressement. So,\nthere it is, all settled. Cedarquist and the girls are gone on ahead,\nand you are to take the old lady like a dear, dear poet. I believe I\nhear the carriage. Allons! En voiture!”\n\nOnce settled in the cool gloom of the coupe, odorous of leather and\nupholstery, Mrs. Cedarquist exclaimed:\n\n“And I've never told you who you were to dine with; oh, a personage,\nreally. Fancy, you will be in the camp of your dearest foes. You are\nto dine with the Gerard people, one of the Vice-Presidents of your bete\nnoir, the P. and S. W. Railroad.”\n\nPresley started, his fists clenching so abruptly as to all but split his\nwhite gloves. He was not conscious of what he said in reply, and Mrs.\nCedarquist was so taken up with her own endless stream of talk that she\ndid not observe his confusion.\n\n“Their daughter Honora is going to Europe next week; her mother is to\ntake her, and Mrs. Gerard is to have just a few people to dinner--very\ninformal, you know--ourselves, you and, oh, I don't know, two or three\nothers. Have you ever seen Honora? The prettiest little thing, and\nwill she be rich? Millions, I would not dare say how many. Tiens. Nous\nvoici.”\n\nThe coupe drew up to the curb, and Presley followed Mrs. Cedarquist up\nthe steps to the massive doors of the great house. In a confused daze,\nhe allowed one of the footmen to relieve him of his hat and coat; in a\ndaze he rejoined Mrs. Cedarquist in a room with a glass roof, hung with\npictures, the art gallery, no doubt, and in a daze heard their names\nannounced at the entrance of another room, the doors of which were hung\nwith thick, blue curtains.\n\nHe entered, collecting his wits for the introductions and presentations\nthat he foresaw impended.\n\nThe room was very large, and of excessive loftiness. Flat, rectagonal\npillars of a rose-tinted, variegated marble, rose from the floor almost\nflush with the walls, finishing off at the top with gilded capitals of\na Corinthian design, which supported the ceiling. The ceiling itself,\ninstead of joining the walls at right angles, curved to meet them, a\ndevice that produced a sort of dome-like effect. This ceiling was a maze\nof golden involutions in very high relief, that adjusted themselves to\nform a massive framing for a great picture, nymphs and goddesses, white\ndoves, golden chariots and the like, all wreathed about with clouds and\ngarlands of roses. Between the pillars around the sides of the room\nwere hangings of silk, the design--of a Louis Quinze type--of beautiful\nsimplicity and faultless taste. The fireplace was a marvel. It reached\nfrom floor to ceiling; the lower parts, black marble, carved into\ncrouching Atlases, with great muscles that upbore the superstructure.\nThe design of this latter, of a kind of purple marble, shot through\nwith white veinings, was in the same style as the design of the\nsilk hangings. In its midst was a bronze escutcheon, bearing an\nundecipherable monogram and a Latin motto. Andirons of brass, nearly six\nfeet high, flanked the hearthstone.\n\nThe windows of the room were heavily draped in sombre brocade and ecru\nlace, in which the initials of the family were very beautifully worked.\nBut directly opposite the fireplace, an extra window, lighted from\nthe adjoining conservatory, threw a wonderful, rich light into the\napartment. It was a Gothic window of stained glass, very large, the\ncentre figures being armed warriors, Parsifal and Lohengrin; the one\nwith a banner, the other with a swan. The effect was exquisite, the\nwindow a veritable masterpiece, glowing, flaming, and burning with a\nhundred tints and colours--opalescent, purple, wine-red, clouded pinks,\nroyal blues, saffrons, violets so dark as to be almost black.\n\nUnder foot, the carpet had all the softness of texture of grass; skins\n(one of them of an enormous polar bear) and rugs of silk velvet were\nspread upon the floor. A Renaissance cabinet of ebony, many feet taller\nthan Presley's head, and inlaid with ivory and silver, occupied one\ncorner of the room, while in its centre stood a vast table of Flemish\noak, black, heavy as iron, massive. A faint odour of sandalwood\npervaded the air. From the conservatory near-by, came the splashing of\na fountain. A row of electric bulbs let into the frieze of the walls\nbetween the golden capitals, and burning dimly behind hemispheres of\nclouded glass, threw a subdued light over the whole scene.\n\nMrs. Gerard came forward.\n\n“This is Mr. Presley, of course, our new poet of whom we are all so\nproud. I was so afraid you would be unable to come. You have given me a\nreal pleasure in allowing me to welcome you here.”\n\nThe footman appeared at her elbow.\n\n“Dinner is served, madame,” he announced.\n\n*****\n\nWhen Mrs. Hooven had left the boarding-house on Castro Street, she\nhad taken up a position on a neighbouring corner, to wait for Minna's\nreappearance. Little Hilda, at this time hardly more than six years of\nage, was with her, holding to her hand.\n\nMrs. Hooven was by no means an old woman, but hard work had aged her.\nShe no longer had any claim to good looks. She no longer took much\ninterest in her personal appearance. At the time of her eviction\nfrom the Castro Street boarding-house, she wore a faded black bonnet,\ngarnished with faded artificial flowers of dirty pink. A plaid shawl\nwas about her shoulders. But this day of misfortune had set Mrs. Hooven\nadrift in even worse condition than her daughter. Her purse, containing\na miserable handful of dimes and nickels, was in her trunk, and her\ntrunk was in the hands of the landlady. Minna had been allowed such\nreprieve as her thirty-five cents would purchase. The destitution of\nMrs. Hooven and her little girl had begun from the very moment of her\neviction.\n\nWhile she waited for Minna, watching every street car and every\napproaching pedestrian, a policeman appeared, asked what she did, and,\nreceiving no satisfactory reply, promptly moved her on.\n\nMinna had had little assurance in facing the life struggle of the city.\nMrs. Hooven had absolutely none. In her, grief, distress, the pinch of\npoverty, and, above all, the nameless fear of the turbulent, fierce life\nof the streets, had produced a numbness, an embruted, sodden, silent,\nspeechless condition of dazed mind, and clogged, unintelligent speech.\nShe was dumb, bewildered, stupid, animated but by a single impulse. She\nclung to life, and to the life of her little daughter Hilda, with the\nblind tenacity of purpose of a drowning cat.\n\nThus, when ordered to move on by the officer, she had silently obeyed,\nnot even attempting to explain her situation. She walked away to the\nnext street-crossing. Then, in a few moments returned, taking up her\nplace on the corner near the boarding-house, spying upon the approaching\ncable cars, peeping anxiously down the length of the sidewalks.\n\nOnce more, the officer ordered her away, and once more, unprotesting,\nshe complied. But when for the third time the policeman found her on\nthe forbidden spot, he had lost his temper. This time when Mrs. Hooven\ndeparted, he had followed her, and when, bewildered, persistent, she had\nattempted to turn back, he caught her by the shoulder.\n\n“Do you want to get arrested, hey?” he demanded. “Do you want me to lock\nyou up? Say, do you, speak up?”\n\nThe ominous words at length reached Mrs. Hooven's comprehension.\nArrested! She was to be arrested. The countrywoman's fear of the Jail\nnipped and bit eagerly at her unwilling heels. She hurried off, thinking\nto return to her post after the policeman should have gone away. But\nwhen, at length, turning back, she tried to find the boarding-house, she\nsuddenly discovered that she was on an unfamiliar street. Unwittingly,\nno doubt, she had turned a corner. She could not retrace her steps. She\nand Hilda were lost.\n\n“Mammy, I'm tired,” Hilda complained.\n\nHer mother picked her up.\n\n“Mammy, where're we gowun, mammy?”\n\nWhere, indeed? Stupefied, Mrs. Hooven looked about her at the endless\nblocks of buildings, the endless procession of vehicles in the streets,\nthe endless march of pedestrians on the sidewalks. Where was Minna;\nwhere was she and her baby to sleep that night? How was Hilda to be fed?\n\nShe could not stand still. There was no place to sit down; but one thing\nwas left, walk.\n\nAh, that via dolorosa of the destitute, that chemin de la croix of the\nhomeless. Ah, the mile after mile of granite pavement that MUST be, MUST\nbe traversed. Walk they must. Move, they must; onward, forward, whither\nthey cannot tell; why, they do not know. Walk, walk, walk with bleeding\nfeet and smarting joints; walk with aching back and trembling knees;\nwalk, though the senses grow giddy with fatigue, though the eyes droop\nwith sleep, though every nerve, demanding rest, sets in motion its tiny\nalarm of pain. Death is at the end of that devious, winding maze of\npaths, crossed and re-crossed and crossed again. There is but one goal\nto the via dolorosa; there is no escape from the central chamber of that\nlabyrinth. Fate guides the feet of them that are set therein. Double on\ntheir steps though they may, weave in and out of the myriad corners of\nthe city's streets, return, go forward, back, from side to side, here,\nthere, anywhere, dodge, twist, wind, the central chamber where Death\nsits is reached inexorably at the end.\n\nSometimes leading and sometimes carrying Hilda, Mrs. Hooven set off\nupon her objectless journey. Block after block she walked, street after\nstreet. She was afraid to stop, because of the policemen. As often as\nshe so much as slackened her pace, she was sure to see one of these\nterrible figures in the distance, watching her, so it seemed to her,\nwaiting for her to halt for the fraction of a second, in order that he\nmight have an excuse to arrest her.\n\nHilda fretted incessantly.\n\n“Mammy, where're we gowun? Mammy, I'm tired.” Then, at last, for the\nfirst time, that plaint that stabbed the mother's heart:\n\n“Mammy, I'm hungry.”\n\n“Be qui-ut, den,” said Mrs. Hooven. “Bretty soon we'll hev der subber.”\n\nPassers-by on the sidewalk, men and women in the great six o'clock\nhomeward march, jostled them as they went along. With dumb, dull\ncuriousness, she looked into one after another of the limitless stream\nof faces, and she fancied she saw in them every emotion but pity. The\nfaces were gay, were anxious, were sorrowful, were mirthful, were lined\nwith thought, or were merely flat and expressionless, but not one was\nturned toward her in compassion. The expressions of the faces might be\nvarious, but an underlying callousness was discoverable beneath every\nmask. The people seemed removed from her immeasurably; they were\ninfinitely above her. What was she to them, she and her baby, the\ncrippled outcasts of the human herd, the unfit, not able to survive,\nthrust out on the heath to perish?\n\nTo beg from these people did not yet occur to her. There was no pride,\nhowever, in the matter. She would have as readily asked alms of so many\nsphinxes.\n\nShe went on. Without willing it, her feet carried her in a wide circle.\nSoon she began to recognise the houses; she had been in that street\nbefore. Somehow, this was distasteful to her; so, striking off at right\nangles, she walked straight before her for over a dozen blocks. By now,\nit was growing darker. The sun had set. The hands of a clock on the\npower-house of a cable line pointed to seven. No doubt, Minna had come\nlong before this time, had found her mother gone, and had--just what had\nshe done, just what COULD she do? Where was her daughter now? Walking\nthe streets herself, no doubt. What was to become of Minna, pretty\ngirl that she was, lost, houseless and friendless in the maze of these\nstreets? Mrs. Hooven, roused from her lethargy, could not repress an\nexclamation of anguish. Here was misfortune indeed; here was calamity.\nShe bestirred herself, and remembered the address of the boarding-house.\nShe might inquire her way back thither. No doubt, by now the policeman\nwould be gone home for the night. She looked about. She was in the\ndistrict of modest residences, and a young man was coming toward her,\ncarrying a new garden hose looped around his shoulder.\n\n“Say, Meest'r; say, blease----”\n\nThe young man gave her a quick look and passed on, hitching the coil\nof hose over his shoulder. But a few paces distant, he slackened in his\nwalk and fumbled in his vest pocket with his fingers. Then he came back\nto Mrs. Hooven and put a quarter into her hand.\n\nMrs. Hooven stared at the coin stupefied. The young man disappeared.\nHe thought, then, that she was begging. It had come to that; she,\nindependent all her life, whose husband had held five hundred acres of\nwheat land, had been taken for a beggar. A flush of shame shot to her\nface. She was about to throw the money after its giver. But at the\nmoment, Hilda again exclaimed:\n\n“Mammy, I'm hungry.”\n\nWith a movement of infinite lassitude and resigned acceptance of the\nsituation, Mrs. Hooven put the coin in her pocket. She had no right to\nbe proud any longer. Hilda must have food.\n\nThat evening, she and her child had supper at a cheap restaurant in\na poor quarter of the town, and passed the night on the benches of a\nlittle uptown park.\n\nUnused to the ways of the town, ignorant as to the customs and\npossibilities of eating-houses, she spent the whole of her quarter upon\nsupper for herself and Hilda, and had nothing left wherewith to buy a\nlodging.\n\nThe night was dreadful; Hilda sobbed herself to sleep on her mother's\nshoulder, waking thereafter from hour to hour, to protest, though\nwrapped in her mother's shawl, that she was cold, and to enquire why\nthey did not go to bed. Drunken men snored and sprawled near at hand.\nTowards morning, a loafer, reeking of alcohol, sat down beside her,\nand indulged in an incoherent soliloquy, punctuated with oaths and\nobscenities. It was not till far along towards daylight that she fell\nasleep.\n\nShe awoke to find it broad day. Hilda--mercifully--slept. Her mother's\nlimbs were stiff and lame with cold and damp; her head throbbed. She\nmoved to another bench which stood in the rays of the sun, and for a\nlong two hours sat there in the thin warmth, till the moisture of the\nnight that clung to her clothes was evaporated.\n\nA policeman came into view. She woke Hilda, and carrying her in her\narms, took herself away.\n\n“Mammy,” began Hilda as soon as she was well awake; “Mammy, I'm hungry.\nI want mein breakfest.”\n\n“Sure, sure, soon now, leedle tochter.”\n\nShe herself was hungry, but she had but little thought of that. How was\nHilda to be fed? She remembered her experience of the previous day, when\nthe young man with the hose had given her money. Was it so easy, then,\nto beg? Could charity be had for the asking? So it seemed; but all that\nwas left of her sturdy independence revolted at the thought. SHE beg!\nSHE hold out the hand to strangers!\n\n“Mammy, I'm hungry.”\n\nThere was no other way. It must come to that in the end. Why temporise,\nwhy put off the inevitable? She sought out a frequented street where men\nand women were on their way to work. One after another, she let them\ngo by, searching their faces, deterred at the very last moment by some\ntrifling variation of expression, a firm set mouth, a serious, level\neyebrow, an advancing chin. Then, twice, when she had made a choice, and\nbrought her resolution to the point of speech, she quailed, shrinking,\nher ears tingling, her whole being protesting against the degradation.\nEvery one must be looking at her. Her shame was no doubt the object of\nan hundred eyes.\n\n“Mammy, I'm hungry,” protested Hilda again.\n\nShe made up her mind. What, though, was she to say? In what words did\nbeggars ask for assistance?\n\nShe tried to remember how tramps who had appeared at her back door\non Los Muertos had addressed her; how and with what formula certain\nmendicants of Bonneville had appealed to her. Then, having settled upon\na phrase, she approached a whiskered gentleman with a large stomach,\nwalking briskly in the direction of the town.\n\n“Say, den, blease hellup a boor womun.”\n\nThe gentleman passed on.\n\n“Perhaps he doand hear me,” she murmured.\n\nTwo well-dressed women advanced, chattering gayly.\n\n“Say, say, den, blease hellup a boor womun.”\n\nOne of the women paused, murmuring to her companion, and from her purse\nextracted a yellow ticket which she gave to Mrs. Hooven with voluble\nexplanations. But Mrs. Hooven was confused, she did not understand. What\ncould the ticket mean? The women went on their way.\n\nThe next person to whom she applied was a young girl of about eighteen,\nvery prettily dressed.\n\n“Say, say, den, blease hellup a boor womun.”\n\nIn evident embarrassment, the young girl paused and searched in her\nlittle pocketbook. “I think I have--I think--I have just ten cents here\nsomewhere,” she murmured again and again.\n\nIn the end, she found a dime, and dropped it into Mrs. Hooven's palm.\n\nThat was the beginning. The first step once taken, the others became\neasy. All day long, Mrs. Hooven and Hilda followed the streets, begging,\nbegging. Here it was a nickel, there a dime, here a nickel again. But\nshe was not expert in the art, nor did she know where to buy food the\ncheapest; and the entire day's work resulted only in barely enough for\ntwo meals of bread, milk, and a wretchedly cooked stew. Tuesday night\nfound the pair once more shelterless.\n\nOnce more, Mrs. Hooven and her baby passed the night on the park\nbenches. But early on Wednesday morning, Mrs. Hooven found herself\nassailed by sharp pains and cramps in her stomach. What was the\ncause she could not say; but as the day went on, the pains increased,\nalternating with hot flushes over all her body, and a certain weakness\nand faintness. As the day went on, the pain and the weakness increased.\nWhen she tried to walk, she found she could do so only with the greatest\ndifficulty. Here was fresh misfortune. To beg, she must walk. Dragging\nherself forward a half-block at a time, she regained the street once\nmore. She succeeded in begging a couple of nickels, bought a bag of\napples from a vender, and, returning to the park, sank exhausted upon a\nbench.\n\nHere she remained all day until evening, Hilda alternately whimpering\nfor her bread and milk, or playing languidly in the gravel walk at her\nfeet. In the evening, she started out again. This time, it was bitter\nhard. Nobody seemed inclined to give. Twice she was “moved on” by\npolicemen. Two hours' begging elicited but a single dime. With this, she\nbought Hilda's bread and milk, and refusing herself to eat, returned to\nthe bench--the only home she knew--and spent the night shivering with\ncold, burning with fever.\n\nFrom Wednesday morning till Friday evening, with the exception of the\nfew apples she had bought, and a quarter of a loaf of hard bread that\nshe found in a greasy newspaper--scraps of a workman's dinner--Mrs.\nHooven had nothing to eat. In her weakened condition, begging became\nhourly more difficult, and such little money as was given her, she\nresolutely spent on Hilda's bread and milk in the morning and evening.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, she was very weak, indeed. Her eyes troubled her.\nShe could no longer see distinctly, and at times there appeared to\nher curious figures, huge crystal goblets of the most graceful shapes,\nfloating and swaying in the air in front of her, almost within arm's\nreach. Vases of elegant forms, made of shimmering glass, bowed and\ncourtesied toward her. Glass bulbs took graceful and varying shapes\nbefore her vision, now rounding into globes, now evolving into\nhour-glasses, now twisting into pretzel-shaped convolutions.\n\n“Mammy, I'm hungry,” insisted Hilda, passing her hands over her face.\nMrs. Hooven started and woke. It was Friday evening. Already the street\nlamps were being lit.\n\n“Gome, den, leedle girl,” she said, rising and taking Hilda's hand.\n“Gome, den, we go vind subber, hey?”\n\nShe issued from the park and took a cross street, directly away from the\nlocality where she had begged the previous days. She had had no success\nthere of late. She would try some other quarter of the town. After a\nweary walk, she came out upon Van Ness Avenue, near its junction with\nMarket Street. She turned into the avenue, and went on toward the Bay,\npainfully traversing block after block, begging of all whom she met (for\nshe no longer made any distinction among the passers-by).\n\n“Say, say, den, blease hellup a boor womun.”\n\n“Mammy, mammy, I'm hungry.”\n\nIt was Friday night, between seven and eight. The great deserted avenue\nwas already dark. A sea fog was scudding overhead, and by degrees\ndescending lower. The warmth was of the meagerest, and the street lamps,\nbirds of fire in cages of glass, fluttered and danced in the prolonged\ngusts of the trade wind that threshed and weltered in the city streets\nfrom off the ocean.\n\n*****\n\nPresley entered the dining-room of the Gerard mansion with little Miss\nGerard on his arm. The other guests had preceded them--Cedarquist with\nMrs. Gerard; a pale-faced, languid young man (introduced to Presley\nas Julian Lambert) with Presley's cousin Beatrice, one of the twin\ndaughters of Mr. and Mrs. Cedarquist; his brother Stephen, whose\nhair was straight as an Indian's, but of a pallid straw color, with\nBeatrice's sister; Gerard himself, taciturn, bearded, rotund, loud of\nbreath, escorted Mrs. Cedarquist. Besides these, there were one or two\nother couples, whose names Presley did not remember.\n\nThe dining-room was superb in its appointments. On three sides of the\nroom, to the height of some ten feet, ran a continuous picture, an oil\npainting, divided into long sections by narrow panels of black oak. The\npainting represented the personages in the Romaunt de la Rose, and\nwas conceived in an atmosphere of the most delicate, most ephemeral\nallegory. One saw young chevaliers, blue-eyed, of elemental beauty\nand purity; women with crowns, gold girdles, and cloudy wimples; young\ngirls, entrancing in their loveliness, wearing snow-white kerchiefs,\ntheir golden hair unbound and flowing, dressed in white samite, bearing\narmfuls of flowers; the whole procession defiling against a background\nof forest glades, venerable oaks, half-hidden fountains, and fields of\nasphodel and roses.\n\nOtherwise, the room was simple. Against the side of the wall unoccupied\nby the picture stood a sideboard of gigantic size, that once had adorned\nthe banquet hall of an Italian palace of the late Renaissance. It was\nblack with age, and against its sombre surfaces glittered an array of\nheavy silver dishes and heavier cut-glass bowls and goblets.\n\nThe company sat down to the first course of raw Blue Point oysters,\nserved upon little pyramids of shaved ice, and the two butlers at once\nbegan filling the glasses of the guests with cool Haut Sauterne.\n\nMrs. Gerard, who was very proud of her dinners, and never able to resist\nthe temptation of commenting upon them to her guests, leaned across to\nPresley and Mrs. Cedarquist, murmuring, “Mr. Presley, do you find that\nSauterne too cold? I always believe it is so bourgeois to keep such\na delicate wine as Sauterne on the ice, and to ice Bordeaux or\nBurgundy--oh, it is nothing short of a crime.”\n\n“This is from your own vineyard, is it not?” asked Julian Lambert. “I\nthink I recognise the bouquet.”\n\nHe strove to maintain an attitude of fin gourmet, unable to refrain from\ncomment upon the courses as they succeeded one another.\n\nLittle Honora Gerard turned to Presley:\n\n“You know,” she explained, “Papa has his own vineyards in southern\nFrance. He is so particular about his wines; turns up his nose at\nCalifornia wines. And I am to go there next summer. Ferrieres is the\nname of the place where our vineyards are, the dearest village!” She was\na beautiful little girl of a dainty porcelain type, her colouring low\nin tone. She wore no jewels, but her little, undeveloped neck and\nshoulders, of an exquisite immaturity, rose from the tulle bodice of her\nfirst decollete gown.\n\n“Yes,” she continued; “I'm to go to Europe for the first time. Won't it\nbe gay? And I am to have my own bonne, and Mamma and I are to travel--so\nmany places, Baden, Homburg, Spa, the Tyrol. Won't it be gay?”\n\nPresley assented in meaningless words. He sipped his wine mechanically,\nlooking about that marvellous room, with its subdued saffron lights,\nits glitter of glass and silver, its beautiful women in their elaborate\ntoilets, its deft, correct servants; its array of tableware--cut glass,\nchased silver, and Dresden crockery. It was Wealth, in all its outward\nand visible forms, the signs of an opulence so great that it need never\nbe husbanded. It was the home of a railway “Magnate,” a Railroad King.\nFor this, then, the farmers paid. It was for this that S. Behrman turned\nthe screw, tightened the vise. It was for this that Dyke had been driven\nto outlawry and a jail. It was for this that Lyman Derrick had been\nbought, the Governor ruined and broken, Annixter shot down, Hooven\nkilled.\n\nThe soup, puree a la Derby, was served, and at the same time, as hors\nd'oeuvres, ortolan patties, together with a tiny sandwich made of\nbrowned toast and thin slices of ham, sprinkled over with Parmesan\ncheese. The wine, so Mrs. Gerard caused it to be understood, was Xeres,\nof the 1815 vintage.\n\n*****\n\nMrs. Hooven crossed the avenue. It was growing late. Without knowing\nit, she had come to a part of the city that experienced beggars shunned.\nThere was nobody about. Block after block of residences stretched\naway on either hand, lighted, full of people. But the sidewalks were\ndeserted.\n\n“Mammy,” whimpered Hilda. “I'm tired, carry me.”\n\nUsing all her strength, Mrs. Hooven picked her up and moved on\naimlessly.\n\nThen again that terrible cry, the cry of the hungry child appealing to\nthe helpless mother:\n\n“Mammy, I'm hungry.”\n\n“Ach, Gott, leedle girl,” exclaimed Mrs. Hooven, holding her close to\nher shoulder, the tears starting from her eyes. “Ach, leedle tochter.\nDoand, doand, doand. You praik my hairt. I cen't vind any subber. We got\nnoddings to eat, noddings, noddings.”\n\n“When do we have those bread'n milk again, Mammy?”\n\n“To-morrow--soon--py-and-py, Hilda. I doand know what pecome oaf us now,\nwhat pecome oaf my leedle babby.”\n\nShe went on, holding Hilda against her shoulder with one arm as best she\nmight, one hand steadying herself against the fence railings along the\nsidewalk. At last, a solitary pedestrian came into view, a young man\nin a top hat and overcoat, walking rapidly. Mrs. Hooven held out a\nquivering hand as he passed her.\n\n“Say, say, den, Meest'r, blease hellup a boor womun.”\n\nThe other hurried on.\n\n*****\n\nThe fish course was grenadins of bass and small salmon, the latter\nstuffed, and cooked in white wine and mushroom liquor.\n\n“I have read your poem, of course, Mr. Presley,” observed Mrs. Gerard.\n“'The Toilers,' I mean. What a sermon you read us, you dreadful young\nman. I felt that I ought at once to 'sell all that I have and give to\nthe poor.' Positively, it did stir me up. You may congratulate yourself\nupon making at least one convert. Just because of that poem Mrs.\nCedarquist and I have started a movement to send a whole shipload of\nwheat to the starving people in India. Now, you horrid reactionnaire,\nare you satisfied?”\n\n“I am very glad,” murmured Presley.\n\n“But I am afraid,” observed Mrs. Cedarquist, “that we may be too late.\nThey are dying so fast, those poor people. By the time our ship reaches\nIndia the famine may be all over.”\n\n“One need never be afraid of being 'too late' in the matter of helping\nthe destitute,” answered Presley. “Unfortunately, they are always a\nfixed quantity. 'The poor ye have always with you.'”\n\n“How very clever that is,” said Mrs. Gerard.\n\nMrs. Cedarquist tapped the table with her fan in mild applause.\n\n“Brilliant, brilliant,” she murmured, “epigrammatical.”\n\n“Honora,” said Mrs. Gerard, turning to her daughter, at that moment in\nconversation with the languid Lambert, “Honora, entends-tu, ma cherie,\nl'esprit de notre jeune Lamartine.”\n\n*****\n\nMrs. Hooven went on, stumbling from street to street, holding Hilda to\nher breast. Famine gnawed incessantly at her stomach; walk though she\nmight, turn upon her tracks up and down the streets, back to the avenue\nagain, incessantly and relentlessly the torture dug into her vitals.\nShe was hungry, hungry, and if the want of food harassed and rended\nher, full-grown woman that she was, what must it be in the poor, starved\nstomach of her little girl? Oh, for some helping hand now, oh, for one\nlittle mouthful, one little nibble! Food, food, all her wrecked body\nclamoured for nourishment; anything to numb those gnawing teeth--an\nabandoned loaf, hard, mouldered; a half-eaten fruit, yes, even the\nrefuse of the gutter, even the garbage of the ash heap. On she went,\npeering into dark corners, into the areaways, anywhere, everywhere,\nwatching the silent prowling of cats, the intent rovings of stray\ndogs. But she was growing weaker; the pains and cramps in her stomach\nreturned. Hilda's weight bore her to the pavement. More than once a\ngreat giddiness, a certain wheeling faintness all but overcame her.\nHilda, however, was asleep. To wake her would only mean to revive her to\nthe consciousness of hunger; yet how to carry her further? Mrs. Hooven\nbegan to fear that she would fall with her child in her arms. The terror\nof a collapse upon those cold pavements glistening with fog-damp roused\nher; she must make an effort to get through the night. She rallied all\nher strength, and pausing a moment to shift the weight of her baby to\nthe other arm, once more set off through the night. A little while later\nshe found on the edge of the sidewalk the peeling of a banana. It had\nbeen trodden upon and it was muddy, but joyfully she caught it up.\n\n“Hilda,” she cried, “wake oop, leedle girl. See, loog den, dere's\nsomedings to eat. Look den, hey? Dat's goot, ain't it? Zum bunaner.”\n\nBut it could not be eaten. Decayed, dirty, all but rotting, the stomach\nturned from the refuse, nauseated.\n\n“No, no,” cried Hilda, “that's not good. I can't eat it. Oh, Mammy,\nplease gif me those bread'n milk.”\n\n*****\n\nBy now the guests of Mrs. Gerard had come to the entrees--Londonderry\npheasants, escallops of duck, and rissolettes a la pompadour. The wine\nwas Chateau Latour.\n\nAll around the table conversations were going forward gayly. The good\nwines had broken up the slight restraint of the early part of the\nevening and a spirit of good humour and good fellowship prevailed. Young\nLambert and Mr. Gerard were deep in reminiscences of certain mutual\nduck-shooting expeditions. Mrs. Gerard and Mrs. Cedarquist discussed\na novel--a strange mingling of psychology, degeneracy, and analysis\nof erotic conditions--which had just been translated from the Italian.\nStephen Lambert and Beatrice disputed over the merits of a Scotch collie\njust given to the young lady. The scene was gay, the electric bulbs\nsparkled, the wine flashing back the light. The entire table was a vague\nglow of white napery, delicate china, and glass as brilliant as crystal.\nBehind the guests the serving-men came and went, filling the glasses\ncontinually, changing the covers, serving the entrees, managing the\ndinner without interruption, confusion, or the slightest unnecessary\nnoise.\n\nBut Presley could find no enjoyment in the occasion. From that picture\nof feasting, that scene of luxury, that atmosphere of decorous,\nwell-bred refinement, his thoughts went back to Los Muertos and Quien\nSabe and the irrigating ditch at Hooven's. He saw them fall, one by one,\nHarran, Annixter, Osterman, Broderson, Hooven. The clink of the wine\nglasses was drowned in the explosion of revolvers. The Railroad might\nindeed be a force only, which no man could control and for which no man\nwas responsible, but his friends had been killed, but years of extortion\nand oppression had wrung money from all the San Joaquin, money that had\nmade possible this very scene in which he found himself. Because Magnus\nhad been beggared, Gerard had become Railroad King; because the farmers\nof the valley were poor, these men were rich.\n\nThe fancy grew big in his mind, distorted, caricatured, terrible.\nBecause the farmers had been killed at the irrigation ditch, these\nothers, Gerard and his family, fed full. They fattened on the blood of\nthe People, on the blood of the men who had been killed at the ditch.\nIt was a half-ludicrous, half-horrible “dog eat dog,” an unspeakable\ncannibalism. Harran, Annixter, and Hooven were being devoured there\nunder his eyes. These dainty women, his cousin Beatrice and little Miss\nGerard, frail, delicate; all these fine ladies with their small fingers\nand slender necks, suddenly were transfigured in his tortured mind into\nharpies tearing human flesh. His head swam with the horror of it, the\nterror of it. Yes, the People WOULD turn some day, and turning, rend\nthose who now preyed upon them. It would be “dog eat dog” again, with\npositions reversed, and he saw for one instant of time that splendid\nhouse sacked to its foundations, the tables overturned, the pictures\ntorn, the hangings blazing, and Liberty, the red-handed Man in the\nStreet, grimed with powder smoke, foul with the gutter, rush yelling,\ntorch in hand, through every door.\n\n*****\n\nAt ten o'clock Mrs. Hooven fell.\n\nLuckily she was leading Hilda by the hand at the time and the little\ngirl was not hurt. In vain had Mrs. Hooven, hour after hour, walked the\nstreets. After a while she no longer made any attempt to beg; nobody was\nstirring, nor did she even try to hunt for food with the stray dogs and\ncats. She had made up her mind to return to the park in order to\nsit upon the benches there, but she had mistaken the direction, and\nfollowing up Sacramento Street, had come out at length, not upon the\npark, but upon a great vacant lot at the very top of the Clay Street\nhill. The ground was unfenced and rose above her to form the cap of the\nhill, all overgrown with bushes and a few stunted live oaks. It was in\ntrying to cross this piece of ground that she fell. She got upon her\nfeet again.\n\n“Ach, Mammy, did you hurt yourself?” asked Hilda.\n\n“No, no.”\n\n“Is that house where we get those bread'n milk?”\n\nHilda pointed to a single rambling building just visible in the night,\nthat stood isolated upon the summit of the hill in a grove of trees.\n\n“No, no, dere aindt no braid end miluk, leedle tochter.”\n\nHilda once more began to sob.\n\n“Ach, Mammy, please, PLEASE, I want it. I'm hungry.”\n\nThe jangled nerves snapped at last under the tension, and Mrs. Hooven,\nsuddenly shaking Hilda roughly, cried out: “Stop, stop. Doand say ut\negen, you. My Gott, you kill me yet.”\n\nBut quick upon this came the reaction. The mother caught her little\ngirl to her, sinking down upon her knees, putting her arms around her,\nholding her close.\n\n“No, no, gry all so mudge es you want. Say dot you are hongry. Say ut\negen, say ut all de dime, ofer end ofer egen. Say ut, poor, starfing,\nleedle babby. Oh, mein poor, leedle tochter. My Gott, oh, I go crazy\nbretty soon, I guess. I cen't hellup you. I cen't ged you noddings to\neat, noddings, noddings. Hilda, we gowun to die togedder. Put der arms\nroundt me, soh, tighd, leedle babby. We gowun to die, we gowun to vind\nPopper. We aindt gowun to be hongry eny more.”\n\n“Vair we go now?” demanded Hilda.\n\n“No places. Mommer's soh tiredt. We stop heir, leedle while, end rest.”\n\nUnderneath a large bush that afforded a little shelter from the wind,\nMrs. Hooven lay down, taking Hilda in her arms and wrapping her shawl\nabout her. The infinite, vast night expanded gigantic all around them.\nAt this elevation they were far above the city. It was still. Close\noverhead whirled the chariots of the fog, galloping landward, smothering\nlights, blurring outlines. Soon all sight of the town was shut out; even\nthe solitary house on the hilltop vanished. There was nothing left but\ngrey, wheeling fog, and the mother and child, alone, shivering in a\nlittle strip of damp ground, an island drifting aimlessly in empty\nspace.\n\nHilda's fingers touched a leaf from the bush and instinctively closed\nupon it and carried it to her mouth.\n\n“Mammy,” she said, “I'm eating those leaf. Is those good?”\n\nHer mother did not reply.\n\n“You going to sleep, Mammy?” inquired Hilda, touching her face.\n\nMrs. Hooven roused herself a little.\n\n“Hey? Vat you say? Asleep? Yais, I guess I wass asleep.”\n\nHer voice trailed unintelligibly to silence again. She was not, however,\nasleep. Her eyes were open. A grateful numbness had begun to creep over\nher, a pleasing semi-insensibility. She no longer felt the pain and\ncramps of her stomach, even the hunger was ceasing to bite.\n\n*****\n\n“These stuffed artichokes are delicious, Mrs. Gerard,” murmured young\nLambert, wiping his lips with a corner of his napkin. “Pardon me for\nmentioning it, but your dinner must be my excuse.”\n\n“And this asparagus--since Mr. Lambert has set the bad example,”\n observed Mrs. Cedarquist, “so delicate, such an exquisite flavour. How\ndo you manage?”\n\n“We get all our asparagus from the southern part of the State, from one\nparticular ranch,” explained Mrs. Gerard. “We order it by wire and get\nit only twenty hours after cutting. My husband sees to it that it is\nput on a special train. It stops at this ranch just to take on our\nasparagus. Extravagant, isn't it, but I simply cannot eat asparagus that\nhas been cut more than a day.”\n\n“Nor I,” exclaimed Julian Lambert, who posed as an epicure. “I can tell\nto an hour just how long asparagus has been picked.”\n\n“Fancy eating ordinary market asparagus,” said Mrs. Gerard, “that has\nbeen fingered by Heaven knows how many hands.”\n\n*****\n\n“Mammy, mammy, wake up,” cried Hilda, trying to push open Mrs. Hooven's\neyelids, at last closed. “Mammy, don't. You're just trying to frighten\nme.”\n\nFeebly Hilda shook her by the shoulder. At last Mrs. Hooven's lips\nstirred. Putting her head down, Hilda distinguished the whispered words:\n\n“I'm sick. Go to schleep....Sick....Noddings to eat.”\n\n*****\n\nThe dessert was a wonderful preparation of alternate layers of biscuit\nglaces, ice cream, and candied chestnuts.\n\n“Delicious, is it not?” observed Julian Lambert, partly to himself,\npartly to Miss Cedarquist. “This Moscovite fouette--upon my word, I have\nnever tasted its equal.”\n\n“And you should know, shouldn't you?” returned the young lady.\n\n*****\n\n“Mammy, mammy, wake up,” cried Hilda. “Don't sleep so. I'm frightenedt.”\n\nRepeatedly she shook her; repeatedly she tried to raise the inert\neyelids with the point of her finger. But her mother no longer stirred.\nThe gaunt, lean body, with its bony face and sunken eye-sockets, lay\nback, prone upon the ground, the feet upturned and showing the ragged,\nworn soles of the shoes, the forehead and grey hair beaded with fog, the\npoor, faded bonnet awry, the poor, faded dress soiled and torn. Hilda\ndrew close to her mother, kissing her face, twining her arms around\nher neck. For a long time, she lay that way, alternately sobbing and\nsleeping. Then, after a long time, there was a stir. She woke from a\ndoze to find a police officer and two or three other men bending over\nher. Some one carried a lantern. Terrified, smitten dumb, she was unable\nto answer the questions put to her. Then a woman, evidently a mistress\nof the house on the top of the hill, arrived and took Hilda in her arms\nand cried over her.\n\n“I'll take the little girl,” she said to the police officer.\n\n“But the mother, can you save her? Is she too far gone?”\n\n“I've sent for a doctor,” replied the other.\n\n*****\n\nJust before the ladies left the table, young Lambert raised his glass of\nMadeira. Turning towards the wife of the Railroad King, he said:\n\n“My best compliments for a delightful dinner.”\n\n*****\n\nThe doctor who had been bending over Mrs. Hooven, rose.\n\n“It's no use,” he said; “she has been dead some time--exhaustion from\nstarvation.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nOn Division Number Three of the Los Muertos ranch the wheat had already\nbeen cut, and S. Behrman on a certain morning in the first week of\nAugust drove across the open expanse of stubble toward the southwest,\nhis eyes searching the horizon for the feather of smoke that would\nmark the location of the steam harvester. However, he saw nothing. The\nstubble extended onward apparently to the very margin of the world.\n\nAt length, S. Behrman halted his buggy and brought out his field glasses\nfrom beneath the seat. He stood up in his place and, adjusting the\nlenses, swept the prospect to the south and west. It was the same as\nthough the sea of land were, in reality, the ocean, and he, lost in an\nopen boat, were scanning the waste through his glasses, looking for the\nsmoke of a steamer, hull down, below the horizon. “Wonder,” he muttered,\n“if they're working on Four this morning?”\n\nAt length, he murmured an “Ah” of satisfaction. Far to the south into\nthe white sheen of sky, immediately over the horizon, he made out a\nfaint smudge--the harvester beyond doubt.\n\nThither S. Behrman turned his horse's head. It was all of an hour's\ndrive over the uneven ground and through the crackling stubble, but at\nlength he reached the harvester. He found, however, that it had been\nhalted. The sack sewers, together with the header-man, were stretched\non the ground in the shade of the machine, while the engineer and\nseparator-man were pottering about a portion of the works.\n\n“What's the matter, Billy?” demanded S. Behrman reining up.\n\nThe engineer turned about.\n\n“The grain is heavy in here. We thought we'd better increase the speed\nof the cup-carrier, and pulled up to put in a smaller sprocket.”\n\nS. Behrman nodded to say that was all right, and added a question.\n\n“How is she going?”\n\n“Anywheres from twenty-five to thirty sacks to the acre right along\nhere; nothing the matter with THAT I guess.”\n\n“Nothing in the world, Bill.”\n\nOne of the sack sewers interposed:\n\n“For the last half hour we've been throwing off three bags to the\nminute.”\n\n“That's good, that's good.”\n\nIt was more than good; it was “bonanza,” and all that division of the\ngreat ranch was thick with just such wonderful wheat. Never had Los\nMuertos been more generous, never a season more successful. S. Behrman\ndrew a long breath of satisfaction. He knew just how great was his share\nin the lands which had just been absorbed by the corporation he served,\njust how many thousands of bushels of this marvellous crop were his\nproperty. Through all these years of confusion, bickerings, open\nhostility and, at last, actual warfare he had waited, nursing his\npatience, calm with the firm assurance of ultimate success. The end, at\nlength, had come; he had entered into his reward and saw himself at last\ninstalled in the place he had so long, so silently coveted; saw himself\nchief of a principality, the Master of the Wheat.\n\nThe sprocket adjusted, the engineer called up the gang and the men took\ntheir places. The fireman stoked vigorously, the two sack sewers resumed\ntheir posts on the sacking platform, putting on the goggles that kept\nthe chaff from their eyes. The separator-man and header-man gripped\ntheir levers.\n\nThe harvester, shooting a column of thick smoke straight upward,\nvibrating to the top of the stack, hissed, clanked, and lurched forward.\nInstantly, motion sprang to life in all its component parts; the header\nknives, cutting a thirty-six foot swath, gnashed like teeth; beltings\nslid and moved like smooth flowing streams; the separator whirred,\nthe agitator jarred and crashed; cylinders, augers, fans, seeders and\nelevators, drapers and chaff-carriers clattered, rumbled, buzzed, and\nclanged. The steam hissed and rasped; the ground reverberated a hollow\nnote, and the thousands upon thousands of wheat stalks sliced and\nslashed in the clashing shears of the header, rattled like dry rushes in\na hurricane, as they fell inward, and were caught up by an endless belt,\nto disappear into the bowels of the vast brute that devoured them.\n\nIt was that and no less. It was the feeding of some prodigious monster,\ninsatiable, with iron teeth, gnashing and threshing into the fields\nof standing wheat; devouring always, never glutted, never satiated,\nswallowing an entire harvest, snarling and slobbering in a welter of\nwarm vapour, acrid smoke, and blinding, pungent clouds of chaff. It\nmoved belly-deep in the standing grain, a hippopotamus, half-mired in\nriver ooze, gorging rushes, snorting, sweating; a dinosaur wallowing\nthrough thick, hot grasses, floundering there, crouching, grovelling\nthere as its vast jaws crushed and tore, and its enormous gullet\nswallowed, incessant, ravenous, and inordinate.\n\nS. Behrman, very much amused, changed places with one of the sack\nsewers, allowing him to hold his horse while he mounted the sacking\nplatform and took his place. The trepidation and jostling of the machine\nshook him till his teeth chattered in his head. His ears were shocked\nand assaulted by a myriad-tongued clamour, clashing steel, straining\nbelts, jarring woodwork, while the impalpable chaff powder from the\nseparators settled like dust in his hair, his ears, eyes, and mouth.\n\nDirectly in front of where he sat on the platform was the chute from\nthe cleaner, and from this into the mouth of a half-full sack spouted an\nunending gush of grain, winnowed, cleaned, threshed, ready for the mill.\n\nThe pour from the chute of the cleaner had for S. Behrman an immense\nsatisfaction. Without an instant's pause, a thick rivulet of wheat\nrolled and dashed tumultuous into the sack. In half a minute--sometimes\nin twenty seconds--the sack was full, was passed over to the second\nsewer, the mouth reeved up, and the sack dumped out upon the ground, to\nbe picked up by the wagons and hauled to the railroad.\n\nS. Behrman, hypnotised, sat watching that river of grain. All that\nshrieking, bellowing machinery, all that gigantic organism, all the\nmonths of labour, the ploughing, the planting, the prayers for rain, the\nyears of preparation, the heartaches, the anxiety, the foresight, all\nthe whole business of the ranch, the work of horses, of steam, of men\nand boys, looked to this spot--the grain chute from the harvester into\nthe sacks. Its volume was the index of failure or success, of riches or\npoverty. And at this point, the labour of the rancher ended. Here, at\nthe lip of the chute, he parted company with his grain, and from here\nthe wheat streamed forth to feed the world. The yawning mouths of the\nsacks might well stand for the unnumbered mouths of the People, all\nagape for food; and here, into these sacks, at first so lean, so\nflaccid, attenuated like starved stomachs, rushed the living stream\nof food, insistent, interminable, filling the empty, fattening the\nshrivelled, making it sleek and heavy and solid.\n\nHalf an hour later, the harvester stopped again. The men on the sacking\nplatform had used up all the sacks. But S. Behrman's foreman, a new\nman on Los Muertos, put in an appearance with the report that the wagon\nbringing a fresh supply was approaching.\n\n“How is the grain elevator at Port Costa getting on, sir?”\n\n“Finished,” replied S. Behrman.\n\nThe new master of Los Muertos had decided upon accumulating his grain in\nbulk in a great elevator at the tide-water port, where the grain ships\nfor Liverpool and the East took on their cargoes. To this end, he had\nbought and greatly enlarged a building at Port Costa, that was already\nin use for that purpose, and to this elevator all the crop of Los\nMuertos was to be carried. The P. and S. W. made S. Behrman a special\nrate.\n\n“By the way,” said S. Behrman to his superintendent, “we're in luck.\nFallon's buyer was in Bonneville yesterday. He's buying for Fallon and\nfor Holt, too. I happened to run into him, and I've sold a ship load.”\n\n“A ship load!”\n\n“Of Los Muertos wheat. He's acting for some Indian Famine Relief\nCommittee--lot of women people up in the city--and wanted a whole cargo.\nI made a deal with him. There's about fifty thousand tons of disengaged\nshipping in San Francisco Bay right now, and ships are fighting for\ncharters. I wired McKissick and got a long distance telephone from him\nthis morning. He got me a barque, the 'Swanhilda.' She'll dock day after\nto-morrow, and begin loading.”\n\n“Hadn't I better take a run up,” observed the superintendent, “and keep\nan eye on things?”\n\n“No,” answered S. Behrman, “I want you to stop down here, and see that\nthose carpenters hustle the work in the ranch house. Derrick will be\nout by then. You see this deal is peculiar. I'm not selling to any\nmiddle-man--not to Fallon's buyer. He only put me on to the thing. I'm\nacting direct with these women people, and I've got to have some hand in\nshipping this stuff myself. But I made my selling figure cover the price\nof a charter. It's a queer, mixed-up deal, and I don't fancy it much,\nbut there's boodle in it. I'll go to Port Costa myself.”\n\nA little later on in the day, when S. Behrman had satisfied himself that\nhis harvesting was going forward favourably, he reentered his buggy\nand driving to the County Road turned southward towards the Los Muertos\nranch house. He had not gone far, however, before he became aware of\na familiar figure on horse-back, jogging slowly along ahead of him. He\nrecognised Presley; he shook the reins over his horse's back and very\nsoon ranging up by the side of the young man passed the time of day with\nhim.\n\n“Well, what brings you down here again, Mr. Presley?” he observed. “I\nthought we had seen the last of you.”\n\n“I came down to say good-bye to my friends,” answered Presley shortly.\n\n“Going away?”\n\n“Yes--to India.”\n\n“Well, upon my word. For your health, hey?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You LOOK knocked up,” asserted the other. “By the way,” he added, “I\nsuppose you've heard the news?”\n\nPresley shrank a little. Of late the reports of disasters had followed\nso swiftly upon one another that he had begun to tremble and to quail at\nevery unexpected bit of information.\n\n“What news do you mean?” he asked.\n\n“About Dyke. He has been convicted. The judge sentenced him for life.”\n\nFor life! Riding on by the side of this man through the ranches by\nthe County Road, Presley repeated these words to himself till the full\neffect of them burst at last upon him.\n\nJailed for life! No outlook. No hope for the future. Day after day, year\nafter year, to tread the rounds of the same gloomy monotony. He saw the\ngrey stone walls, the iron doors; the flagging of the “yard” bare of\ngrass or trees--the cell, narrow, bald, cheerless; the prison garb, the\nprison fare, and round all the grim granite of insuperable barriers,\nshutting out the world, shutting in the man with outcasts, with the\npariah dogs of society, thieves, murderers, men below the beasts, lost\nto all decency, drugged with opium, utter reprobates. To this, Dyke\nhad been brought, Dyke, than whom no man had been more honest, more\ncourageous, more jovial. This was the end of him, a prison; this was his\nfinal estate, a criminal.\n\nPresley found an excuse for riding on, leaving S. Behrman behind him.\nHe did not stop at Caraher's saloon, for the heat of his rage had long\nsince begun to cool, and dispassionately, he saw things in their true\nlight. For all the tragedy of his wife's death, Caraher was none the\nless an evil influence among the ranchers, an influence that worked only\nto the inciting of crime. Unwilling to venture himself, to risk his own\nlife, the anarchist saloon-keeper had goaded Dyke and Presley both to\nmurder; a bad man, a plague spot in the world of the ranchers, poisoning\nthe farmers' bodies with alcohol and their minds with discontent.\n\nAt last, Presley arrived at the ranch house of Los Muertos. The place\nwas silent; the grass on the lawn was half dead and over a foot high;\nthe beginnings of weeds showed here and there in the driveway. He tied\nhis horse to a ring in the trunk of one of the larger eucalyptus trees\nand entered the house.\n\nMrs. Derrick met him in the dining-room. The old look of uneasiness,\nalmost of terror, had gone from her wide-open brown eyes. There was in\nthem instead, the expression of one to whom a contingency, long\ndreaded, has arrived and passed. The stolidity of a settled grief, of an\nirreparable calamity, of a despair from which there was no escape was in\nher look, her manner, her voice. She was listless, apathetic, calm with\nthe calmness of a woman who knows she can suffer no further.\n\n“We are going away,” she told Presley, as the two sat down at opposite\nends of the dining table. “Just Magnus and myself--all there is left\nof us. There is very little money left; Magnus can hardly take care of\nhimself, to say nothing of me. I must look after him now. We are going\nto Marysville.”\n\n“Why there?”\n\n“You see,” she explained, “it happens that my old place is vacant in\nthe Seminary there. I am going back to teach--literature.” She smiled\nwearily. “It is beginning all over again, isn't it? Only there is\nnothing to look forward to now. Magnus is an old man already, and I must\ntake care of him.”\n\n“He will go with you, then,” Presley said, “that will be some comfort to\nyou at least.”\n\n“I don't know,” she said slowly, “you have not seen Magnus lately.”\n\n“Is he--how do you mean? Isn't he any better?”\n\n“Would you like to see him? He is in the office. You can go right in.”\n\nPresley rose. He hesitated a moment, then:\n\n“Mrs. Annixter,” he asked, “Hilma--is she still with you? I should like\nto see her before I go.” “Go in and see Magnus,” said Mrs. Derrick. “I\nwill tell her you are here.”\n\nPresley stepped across the stone-paved hallway with the glass roof,\nand after knocking three times at the office door pushed it open and\nentered.\n\nMagnus sat in the chair before the desk and did not look up as Presley\nentered. He had the appearance of a man nearer eighty than sixty. All\nthe old-time erectness was broken and bent. It was as though the muscles\nthat once had held the back rigid, the chin high, had softened and\nstretched. A certain fatness, the obesity of inertia, hung heavy around\nthe hips and abdomen, the eye was watery and vague, the cheeks and chin\nunshaven and unkempt, the grey hair had lost its forward curl towards\nthe temples and hung thin and ragged around the ears. The hawk-like\nnose seemed hooked to meet the chin; the lips were slack, the mouth\nhalf-opened.\n\nWhere once the Governor had been a model of neatness in his dress, the\nfrock coat buttoned, the linen clean, he now sat in his shirt sleeves,\nthe waistcoat open and showing the soiled shirt. His hands were stained\nwith ink, and these, the only members of his body that yet appeared to\nretain their activity, were busy with a great pile of papers,--oblong,\nlegal documents, that littered the table before him. Without a moment's\ncessation, these hands of the Governor's came and went among the papers,\ndeft, nimble, dexterous.\n\nMagnus was sorting papers. From the heap upon his left hand he selected\na document, opened it, glanced over it, then tied it carefully, and laid\nit away upon a second pile on his right hand. When all the papers were\nin one pile, he reversed the process, taking from his right hand to\nplace upon his left, then back from left to right again, then once more\nfrom right to left. He spoke no word, he sat absolutely still, even\nhis eyes did not move, only his hands, swift, nervous, agitated, seemed\nalive.\n\n“Why, how are you, Governor?” said Presley, coming forward. Magnus\nturned slowly about and looked at him and at the hand in which he shook\nhis own.\n\n“Ah,” he said at length, “Presley...yes.”\n\nThen his glance fell, and he looked aimlessly about upon the floor.\n“I've come to say good-bye, Governor,” continued Presley, “I'm going\naway.”\n\n“Going away...yes, why it's Presley. Good-day, Presley.”\n\n“Good-day, Governor. I'm going away. I've come to say good-bye.”\n\n“Good-bye?” Magnus bent his brows, “what are you saying good-bye for?”\n\n“I'm going away, sir.”\n\nThe Governor did not answer. Staring at the ledge of the desk, he seemed\nlost in thought. There was a long silence. Then, at length, Presley\nsaid:\n\n“How are you getting on, Governor?”\n\nMagnus looked up slowly.\n\n“Why it's Presley,” he said. “How do you do, Presley.”\n\n“Are you getting on all right, sir?”\n\n“Yes,” said Magnus after a while, “yes, all right. I am going away. I've\ncome to say good-bye. No--” He interrupted himself with a deprecatory\nsmile, “YOU said THAT, didn't you?”\n\n“Well, you are going away, too, your wife tells me.”\n\n“Yes, I'm going away. I can't stay on...” he hesitated a long time,\ngroping for the right word, “I can't stay on--on--what's the name of\nthis place?”\n\n“Los Muertos,” put in Presley.\n\n“No, it isn't. Yes, it is, too, that's right, Los Muertos. I don't know\nwhere my memory has gone to of late.”\n\n“Well, I hope you will be better soon, Governor.”\n\nAs Presley spoke the words, S. Behrman entered the room, and the\nGovernor sprang up with unexpected agility and stood against the wall,\ndrawing one long breath after another, watching the railroad agent with\nintent eyes.\n\nS. Behrman saluted both men affably and sat down near the desk, drawing\nthe links of his heavy watch chain through his fat fingers.\n\n“There wasn't anybody outside when I knocked, but I heard your voice in\nhere, Governor, so I came right in. I wanted to ask you, Governor, if\nmy carpenters can begin work in here day after to-morrow. I want to take\ndown that partition there, and throw this room and the next into one. I\nguess that will be O. K., won't it? You'll be out of here by then, won't\nyou?”\n\nThere was no vagueness about Magnus's speech or manner now. There was\nthat same alertness in his demeanour that one sees in a tamed lion in\nthe presence of its trainer.\n\n“Yes, yes,” he said quickly, “you can send your men here. I will be gone\nby to-morrow.”\n\n“I don't want to seem to hurry you, Governor.” “No, you will not hurry\nme. I am ready to go now.”\n\n“Anything I can do for you, Governor?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Yes, there is, Governor,” insisted S. Behrman. “I think now that all is\nover we ought to be good friends. I think I can do something for you. We\nstill want an assistant in the local freight manager's office. Now, what\ndo you say to having a try at it? There's a salary of fifty a month goes\nwith it. I guess you must be in need of money now, and there's always\nthe wife to support; what do you say? Will you try the place?”\n\nPresley could only stare at the man in speechless wonder. What was he\ndriving at? What reason was there back of this new move, and why should\nit be made thus openly and in his hearing? An explanation occurred to\nhim. Was this merely a pleasantry on the part of S. Behrman, a way of\nenjoying to the full his triumph; was he testing the completeness of\nhis victory, trying to see just how far he could go, how far beneath his\nfeet he could push his old-time enemy?\n\n“What do you say?” he repeated. “Will you try the place?”\n\n“You--you INSIST?” inquired the Governor.\n\n“Oh, I'm not insisting on anything,” cried S. Behrman. “I'm offering you\na place, that's all. Will you take it?”\n\n“Yes, yes, I'll take it.”\n\n“You'll come over to our side?”\n\n“Yes, I'll come over.”\n\n“You'll have to turn 'railroad,' understand?”\n\n“I'll turn railroad.”\n\n“Guess there may be times when you'll have to take orders from me.”\n\n“I'll take orders from you.”\n\n“You'll have to be loyal to railroad, you know. No funny business.”\n\n“I'll be loyal to the railroad.”\n\n“You would like the place then?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nS. Behrman turned from Magnus, who at once resumed his seat and began\nagain to sort his papers.\n\n“Well, Presley,” said the railroad agent: “I guess I won't see you\nagain.”\n\n“I hope not,” answered the other.\n\n“Tut, tut, Presley, you know you can't make me angry.”\n\nHe put on his hat of varnished straw and wiped his fat forehead with\nhis handkerchief. Of late, he had grown fatter than ever, and the linen\nvest, stamped with a multitude of interlocked horseshoes, strained tight\nits imitation pearl buttons across the great protuberant stomach.\n\nPresley looked at the man a moment before replying.\n\nBut a few weeks ago he could not thus have faced the great enemy of the\nfarmers without a gust of blind rage blowing tempestuous through all his\nbones. Now, however, he found to his surprise that his fury had\nlapsed to a profound contempt, in which there was bitterness, but no\ntruculence. He was tired, tired to death of the whole business.\n\n“Yes,” he answered deliberately, “I am going away. You have ruined this\nplace for me. I couldn't live here where I should have to see you, or\nthe results of what you have done, whenever I stirred out of doors.”\n\n“Nonsense, Presley,” answered the other, refusing to become angry.\n“That's foolishness, that kind of talk; though, of course, I understand\nhow you feel. I guess it was you, wasn't it, who threw that bomb into my\nhouse?”\n\n“It was.”\n\n“Well, that don't show any common sense, Presley,” returned S. Behrman\nwith perfect aplomb. “What could you have gained by killing me?”\n\n“Not so much probably as you have gained by killing Harran and Annixter.\nBut that's all passed now. You're safe from me.” The strangeness of this\ntalk, the oddity of the situation burst upon him and he laughed aloud.\n“It don't seem as though you could be brought to book, S. Behrman, by\nanybody, or by any means, does it? They can't get at you through the\ncourts,--the law can't get you, Dyke's pistol missed fire for just your\nbenefit, and you even escaped Caraher's six inches of plugged gas pipe.\nJust what are we going to do with you?”\n\n“Best give it up, Pres, my boy,” returned the other. “I guess there\nain't anything can touch me. Well, Magnus,” he said, turning once more\nto the Governor. “Well, I'll think over what you say, and let you know\nif I can get the place for you in a day or two. You see,” he added,\n“you're getting pretty old, Magnus Derrick.”\n\nPresley flung himself from the room, unable any longer to witness the\ndepths into which Magnus had fallen. What other scenes of degradation\nwere enacted in that room, how much further S. Behrman carried the\nhumiliation, he did not know. He suddenly felt that the air of the\noffice was choking him.\n\nHe hurried up to what once had been his own room. On his way he could\nnot but note that much of the house was in disarray, a great packing-up\nwas in progress; trunks, half-full, stood in the hallways, crates and\ncases in a litter of straw encumbered the rooms. The servants came and\nwent with armfuls of books, ornaments, articles of clothing.\n\nPresley took from his room only a few manuscripts and note-books, and a\nsmall valise full of his personal effects; at the doorway he paused and,\nholding the knob of the door in his hand, looked back into the room a\nvery long time.\n\nHe descended to the lower floor and entered the dining-room. Mrs.\nDerrick had disappeared. Presley stood for a long moment in front of the\nfireplace, looking about the room, remembering the scenes that he had\nwitnessed there--the conference when Osterman had first suggested the\nfight for Railroad Commissioner and then later the attack on Lyman\nDerrick and the sudden revelation of that inconceivable treachery. But\nas he stood considering these things a door to his right opened and\nHilma entered the room.\n\nPresley came forward, holding out his hand, all unable to believe his\neyes. It was a woman, grave, dignified, composed, who advanced to meet\nhim. Hilma was dressed in black, the cut and fashion of the gown severe,\nalmost monastic. All the little feminine and contradictory daintinesses\nwere nowhere to be seen. Her statuesque calm evenness of contour\nyet remained, but it was the calmness of great sorrow, of infinite\nresignation. Beautiful she still remained, but she was older. The\nseriousness of one who has gained the knowledge of the world--knowledge\nof its evil--seemed to envelope her. The calm gravity of a great\nsuffering past, but not forgotten, sat upon her. Not yet twenty-one, she\nexhibited the demeanour of a woman of forty.\n\nThe one-time amplitude of her figure, the fulness of hip and shoulder,\nthe great deep swell from waist to throat were gone. She had grown\nthinner and, in consequence, seemed unusually, almost unnaturally tall.\nHer neck was slender, the outline of her full lips and round chin was a\nlittle sharp; her arms, those wonderful, beautiful arms of hers, were\na little shrunken. But her eyes were as wide open as always, rimmed\nas ever by the thin, intensely black line of the lashes and her brown,\nfragrant hair was still thick, still, at times, glittered and coruscated\nin the sun. When she spoke, it was with the old-time velvety huskiness\nof voice that Annixter had learned to love so well.\n\n“Oh, it is you,” she said, giving him her hand. “You were good to want\nto see me before you left. I hear that you are going away.”\n\nShe sat down upon the sofa.\n\n“Yes,” Presley answered, drawing a chair near to her, “yes, I felt I\ncould not stay--down here any longer. I am going to take a long ocean\nvoyage. My ship sails in a few days. But you, Mrs. Annixter, what are\nyou going to do? Is there any way I can serve you?”\n\n“No,” she answered, “nothing. Papa is doing well. We are living here\nnow.”\n\n“You are well?”\n\nShe made a little helpless gesture with both her hands, smiling very\nsadly.\n\n“As you see,” she answered.\n\nAs he talked, Presley was looking at her intently. Her dignity was a new\nelement in her character and the certain slender effect of her figure,\nemphasised now by the long folds of the black gown she wore, carried it\nalmost superbly. She conveyed something of the impression of a queen in\nexile. But she had lost none of her womanliness; rather, the contrary.\nAdversity had softened her, as well as deepened her. Presley saw that\nvery clearly. Hilma had arrived now at her perfect maturity; she had\nknown great love and she had known great grief, and the woman that had\nawakened in her with her affection for Annixter had been strengthened\nand infinitely ennobled by his death. What if things had been different?\nThus, as he conversed with her, Presley found himself wondering. Her\nsweetness, her beautiful gentleness, and tenderness were almost like\npalpable presences. It was almost as if a caress had been laid softly\nupon his cheek, as if a gentle hand closed upon his. Here, he knew, was\nsympathy; here, he knew, was an infinite capacity for love.\n\nThen suddenly all the tired heart of him went out towards her. A longing\nto give the best that was in him to the memory of her, to be strong and\nnoble because of her, to reshape his purposeless, half-wasted life with\nher nobility and purity and gentleness for his inspiration leaped all at\nonce within him, leaped and stood firm, hardening to a resolve stronger\nthan any he had ever known.\n\nFor an instant he told himself that the suddenness of this new emotion\nmust be evidence of its insincerity. He was perfectly well aware that\nhis impulses were abrupt and of short duration. But he knew that this\nwas not sudden. Without realising it, he had been from the first drawn\nto Hilma, and all through these last terrible days, since the time he\nhad seen her at Los Muertos, just after the battle at the ditch, she had\nobtruded continually upon his thoughts. The sight of her to-day, more\nbeautiful than ever, quiet, strong, reserved, had only brought matters\nto a culmination.\n\n“Are you,” he asked her, “are you so unhappy, Hilma, that you can look\nforward to no more brightness in your life?”\n\n“Unless I could forget--forget my husband,” she answered, “how can I\nbe happy? I would rather be unhappy in remembering him than happy in\nforgetting him. He was my whole world, literally and truly. Nothing\nseemed to count before I knew him, and nothing can count for me now,\nafter I have lost him.”\n\n“You think now,” he answered, “that in being happy again you would be\ndisloyal to him. But you will find after a while--years from now--that\nit need not be so. The part of you that belonged to your husband can\nalways keep him sacred, that part of you belongs to him and he to it.\nBut you are young; you have all your life to live yet. Your sorrow need\nnot be a burden to you. If you consider it as you should--as you WILL\nsome day, believe me--it will only be a great help to you. It will make\nyou more noble, a truer woman, more generous.”\n\n“I think I see,” she answered, “and I never thought about it in that\nlight before.”\n\n“I want to help you,” he answered, “as you have helped me. I want to be\nyour friend, and above all things I do not want to see your life wasted.\nI am going away and it is quite possible I shall never see you again,\nbut you will always be a help to me.”\n\n“I do not understand,” she answered, “but I know you mean to be very,\nvery kind to me. Yes, I hope when you come back--if you ever do--you\nwill still be that. I do not know why you should want to be so kind,\nunless--yes, of course--you were my husband's dearest friend.”\n\nThey talked a little longer, and at length Presley rose.\n\n“I cannot bring myself to see Mrs. Derrick again,” he said. “It would\nonly serve to make her very unhappy. Will you explain that to her? I\nthink she will understand.”\n\n“Yes,” answered Hilma. “Yes, I will.”\n\nThere was a pause. There seemed to be nothing more for either of them to\nsay. Presley held out his hand.\n\n“Good-bye,” she said, as she gave him hers.\n\nHe carried it to his lips.\n\n“Good-bye,” he answered. “Good-bye and may God bless you.”\n\nHe turned away abruptly and left the room. But as he was quietly making\nhis way out of the house, hoping to get to his horse unobserved, he came\nsuddenly upon Mrs. Dyke and Sidney on the porch of the house. He had\nforgotten that since the affair at the ditch, Los Muertos had been a\nhome to the engineer's mother and daughter.\n\n“And you, Mrs. Dyke,” he asked as he took her hand, “in this break-up of\neverything, where do you go?”\n\n“To the city,” she answered, “to San Francisco. I have a sister there\nwho will look after the little tad.”\n\n“But you, how about yourself, Mrs. Dyke?”\n\nShe answered him in a quiet voice, monotonous, expressionless:\n\n“I am going to die very soon, Mr. Presley. There is no reason why I\nshould live any longer. My son is in prison for life, everything is over\nfor me, and I am tired, worn out.”\n\n“You mustn't talk like that, Mrs. Dyke,” protested Presley, “nonsense;\nyou will live long enough to see the little tad married.” He tried to\nbe cheerful. But he knew his words lacked the ring of conviction. Death\nalready overshadowed the face of the engineer's mother. He felt that\nshe spoke the truth, and as he stood there speaking to her for the last\ntime, his arm about little Sidney's shoulder, he knew that he was seeing\nthe beginnings of the wreck of another family and that, like Hilda\nHooven, another baby girl was to be started in life, through no fault of\nhers, fearfully handicapped, weighed down at the threshold of existence\nwith a load of disgrace. Hilda Hooven and Sidney Dyke, what was to be\ntheir histories? the one, sister of an outcast; the other, daughter of\na convict. And he thought of that other young girl, the little Honora\nGerard, the heiress of millions, petted, loved, receiving adulation from\nall who came near to her, whose only care was to choose from among\nthe multitude of pleasures that the world hastened to present to her\nconsideration.\n\n“Good-bye,” he said, holding out his hand.\n\n“Good-bye.”\n\n“Good-bye, Sidney.”\n\nHe kissed the little girl, clasped Mrs. Dyke's hand a moment with his;\nthen, slinging his satchel about his shoulders by the long strap with\nwhich it was provided, left the house, and mounting his horse rode away\nfrom Los Muertos never to return.\n\nPresley came out upon the County Road. At a little distance to his left\nhe could see the group of buildings where once Broderson had lived.\nThese were being remodelled, at length, to suit the larger demands of\nthe New Agriculture. A strange man came out by the road gate; no doubt,\nthe new proprietor. Presley turned away, hurrying northwards along the\nCounty Road by the mammoth watering-tank and the long wind-break of\npoplars.\n\nHe came to Caraher's place. There was no change here. The saloon had\nweathered the storm, indispensable to the new as well as to the old\nregime. The same dusty buggies and buckboards were tied under the shed,\nand as Presley hurried by he could distinguish Caraher's voice, loud as\never, still proclaiming his creed of annihilation.\n\nBonneville Presley avoided. He had no associations with the town. He\nturned aside from the road, and crossing the northwest corner of Los\nMuertos and the line of the railroad, turned back along the Upper Road\ntill he came to the Long Trestle and Annixter's,--Silence, desolation,\nabandonment.\n\nA vast stillness, profound, unbroken, brooded low over all the place. No\nliving thing stirred. The rusted wind-mill on the skeleton-like tower of\nthe artesian well was motionless; the great barn empty; the windows of\nthe ranch house, cook house, and dairy boarded up. Nailed upon a tree\nnear the broken gateway was a board, white painted, with stencilled\nletters, bearing the inscription:\n\n“Warning. ALL PERSONS FOUND TRESPASSING ON THESE PREMISES WILL BE\nPROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. By order P. and S. W. R.\nR.”\n\nAs he had planned, Presley reached the hills by the head waters of\nBroderson's Creek late in the afternoon. Toilfully he climbed them,\nreached the highest crest, and turning about, looked long and for the\nlast time at all the reach of the valley unrolled beneath him. The land\nof the ranches opened out forever and forever under the stimulus of that\nmeasureless range of vision. The whole gigantic sweep of the San Joaquin\nexpanded Titanic before the eye of the mind, flagellated with heat,\nquivering and shimmering under the sun's red eye. It was the season\nafter the harvest, and the great earth, the mother, after its period of\nreproduction, its pains of labour, delivered of the fruit of its loins,\nslept the sleep of exhaustion in the infinite repose of the colossus,\nbenignant, eternal, strong, the nourisher of nations, the feeder of an\nentire world.\n\nAnd as Presley looked there came to him strong and true the sense and\nthe significance of all the enigma of growth. He seemed for one\ninstant to touch the explanation of existence. Men were nothings, mere\nanimalculae, mere ephemerides that fluttered and fell and were forgotten\nbetween dawn and dusk. Vanamee had said there was no death. But for one\nsecond Presley could go one step further. Men were naught, death was\nnaught, life was naught; FORCE only existed--FORCE that brought men\ninto the world, FORCE that crowded them out of it to make way for\nthe succeeding generation, FORCE that made the wheat grow, FORCE that\ngarnered it from the soil to give place to the succeeding crop.\n\nIt was the mystery of creation, the stupendous miracle of recreation;\nthe vast rhythm of the seasons, measured, alternative, the sun and the\nstars keeping time as the eternal symphony of reproduction swung in\nits tremendous cadences like the colossal pendulum of an almighty\nmachine--primordial energy flung out from the hand of the Lord God\nhimself, immortal, calm, infinitely strong.\n\nBut as he stood thus looking down upon the great valley he was aware of\nthe figure of a man, far in the distance, moving steadily towards the\nMission of San Juan. The man was hardly more than a dot, but there was\nsomething unmistakably familiar in his gait; and besides this, Presley\ncould fancy that he was hatless. He touched his pony with his spur. The\nman was Vanamee beyond all doubt, and a little later Presley, descending\nthe maze of cow-paths and cattle-trails that led down towards the\nBroderson Creek, overtook his friend.\n\nInstantly Presley was aware of an immense change. Vanamee's face was\nstill that of an ascetic, still glowed with the rarefied intelligence of\na young seer, a half-inspired shepherd-prophet of Hebraic legends; but\nthe shadow of that great sadness which for so long had brooded over\nhim was gone; the grief that once he had fancied deathless was, indeed,\ndead, or rather swallowed up in a victorious joy that radiated like\nsunlight at dawn from the deep-set eyes, and the hollow, swarthy cheeks.\nThey talked together till nearly sundown, but to Presley's questions\nas to the reasons for Vanamee's happiness, the other would say nothing.\nOnce only he allowed himself to touch upon the subject.\n\n“Death and grief are little things,” he said. “They are transient.\nLife must be before death, and joy before grief. Else there are no such\nthings as death or grief. These are only negatives. Life is positive.\nDeath is only the absence of life, just as night is only the absence of\nday, and if this is so, there is no such thing as death. There is only\nlife, and the suppression of life, that we, foolishly, say is death.\n'Suppression,' I say, not extinction. I do not say that life returns.\nLife never departs. Life simply IS. For certain seasons, it is hidden in\nthe dark, but is that death, extinction, annihilation? I take it, thank\nGod, that it is not. Does the grain of wheat, hidden for certain seasons\nin the dark, die? The grain we think is dead RESUMES AGAIN; but how? Not\nas one grain, but as twenty. So all life. Death is only real for all the\ndetritus of the world, for all the sorrow, for all the injustice,\nfor all the grief. Presley, the good never dies; evil dies, cruelty,\noppression, selfishness, greed--these die; but nobility, but love, but\nsacrifice, but generosity, but truth, thank God for it, small as they\nare, difficult as it is to discover them--these live forever, these are\neternal. You are all broken, all cast down by what you have seen in this\nvalley, this hopeless struggle, this apparently hopeless despair. Well,\nthe end is not yet. What is it that remains after all is over, after the\ndead are buried and the hearts are broken? Look at it all from the vast\nheight of humanity--'the greatest good to the greatest numbers.' What\nremains? Men perish, men are corrupted, hearts are rent asunder, but\nwhat remains untouched, unassailable, undefiled? Try to find that, not\nonly in this, but in every crisis of the world's life, and you will\nfind, if your view be large enough, that it is not evil, but good, that\nin the end remains.”\n\nThere was a long pause. Presley, his mind full of new thoughts, held his\npeace, and Vanamee added at length:\n\n“I believed Angele dead. I wept over her grave; mourned for her as dead\nin corruption. She has come back to me, more beautiful than ever. Do not\nask me any further. To put this story, this idyl, into words, would, for\nme, be a profanation. This must suffice you. Angele has returned to me,\nand I am happy. Adios.”\n\nHe rose suddenly. The friends clasped each other's hands.\n\n“We shall probably never meet again,” said Vanamee; “but if these are\nthe last words I ever speak to you, listen to them, and remember them,\nbecause I know I speak the truth. Evil is short-lived. Never judge of\nthe whole round of life by the mere segment you can see. The whole is,\nin the end, perfect.”\n\nAbruptly he took himself away. He was gone. Presley, alone, thoughtful,\nhis hands clasped behind him, passed on through the ranches--here\nteeming with ripened wheat--his face set from them forever.\n\nNot so Vanamee. For hours he roamed the countryside, now through the\ndeserted cluster of buildings that had once been Annixter's home;\nnow through the rustling and, as yet, uncut wheat of Quien Sabe! now\ntreading the slopes of the hills far to the north, and again following\nthe winding courses of the streams. Thus he spent the night.\n\nAt length, the day broke, resplendent, cloudless. The night was passed.\nThere was all the sparkle and effervescence of joy in the crystal\nsunlight as the dawn expanded roseate, and at length flamed dazzling to\nthe zenith when the sun moved over the edge of the world and looked down\nupon all the earth like the eye of God the Father.\n\nAt the moment, Vanamee stood breast-deep in the wheat in a solitary\ncorner of the Quien Sabe rancho. He turned eastward, facing the\ncelestial glory of the day and sent his voiceless call far from him\nacross the golden grain out towards the little valley of flowers.\n\nSwiftly the answer came. It advanced to meet him. The flowers of the\nSeed ranch were gone, dried and parched by the summer's sun, shedding\ntheir seed by handfuls to be sown again and blossom yet another time.\nThe Seed ranch was no longer royal with colour. The roses, the lilies,\nthe carnations, the hyacinths, the poppies, the violets, the mignonette,\nall these had vanished, the little valley was without colour; where once\nit had exhaled the most delicious perfume, it was now odourless. Under\nthe blinding light of the day it stretched to its hillsides, bare,\nbrown, unlovely. The romance of the place had vanished, but with it had\nvanished the Vision.\n\nIt was no longer a figment of his imagination, a creature of dreams that\nadvanced to meet Vanamee. It was Reality--it was Angele in the flesh,\nvital, sane, material, who at last issued forth from the entrance of the\nlittle valley. Romance had vanished, but better than romance was here.\nNot a manifestation, not a dream, but her very self. The night was\ngone, but the sun had risen; the flowers had disappeared, but strong,\nvigorous, noble, the wheat had come.\n\nIn the wheat he waited for her. He saw her coming. She was simply\ndressed. No fanciful wreath of tube-roses was about her head now, no\nstrange garment of red and gold enveloped her now. It was no longer\nan ephemeral illusion of the night, evanescent, mystic, but a simple\ncountry girl coming to meet her lover. The vision of the night had been\nbeautiful, but what was it compared to this? Reality was better than\nRomance. The simple honesty of a loving, trusting heart was better than\na legend of flowers, an hallucination of the moonlight. She came nearer.\nBathed in sunlight, he saw her face to face, saw her hair hanging in two\nstraight plaits on either side of her face, saw the enchanting fulness\nof her lips, the strange, balancing movement of her head upon her\nslender neck. But now she was no longer asleep. The wonderful eyes,\nviolet blue, heavy-lidded, with their perplexing, oriental slant towards\nthe temples, were wide open and fixed upon his.\n\nFrom out the world of romance, out of the moonlight and the star sheen,\nout of the faint radiance of the lilies and the still air heavy with\nperfume, she had at last come to him. The moonlight, the flowers, and\nthe dream were all vanished away. Angele was realised in the Wheat. She\nstood forth in the sunlight, a fact, and no longer a fancy.\n\nHe ran forward to meet her and she held out her arms to him. He caught\nher to him, and she, turning her face to his, kissed him on the mouth.\n\n“I love you, I love you,” she murmured.\n\n*****\n\nUpon descending from his train at Port Costa, S. Behrman asked to be\ndirected at once to where the bark “Swanhilda” was taking on grain.\nThough he had bought and greatly enlarged his new elevator at this port,\nhe had never seen it. The work had been carried on through agents, S.\nBehrman having far too many and more pressing occupations to demand\nhis presence and attention. Now, however, he was to see the concrete\nevidence of his success for the first time.\n\nHe picked his way across the railroad tracks to the line of warehouses\nthat bordered the docks, numbered with enormous Roman numerals and full\nof grain in bags. The sight of these bags of grain put him in mind of\nthe fact that among all the other shippers he was practically alone\nin his way of handling his wheat. They handled the grain in bags;\nhe, however, preferred it in the bulk. Bags were sometimes four cents\napiece, and he had decided to build his elevator and bulk his grain\ntherein, rather than to incur this expense. Only a small part of his\nwheat--that on Number Three division--had been sacked. All the rest,\npractically two-thirds of the entire harvest of Los Muertos, now found\nitself warehoused in his enormous elevator at Port Costa.\n\nTo a certain degree it had been the desire of observing the working of\nhis system of handling the wheat in bulk that had drawn S. Behrman to\nPort Costa. But the more powerful motive had been curiosity, not to say\ndownright sentiment. So long had he planned for this day of triumph,\nso eagerly had he looked forward to it, that now, when it had come, he\nwished to enjoy it to its fullest extent, wished to miss no feature of\nthe disposal of the crop. He had watched it harvested, he had watched it\nhauled to the railway, and now would watch it as it poured into the hold\nof the ship, would even watch the ship as she cleared and got under way.\n\nHe passed through the warehouses and came out upon the dock that ran\nparallel with the shore of the bay. A great quantity of shipping was in\nview, barques for the most part, Cape Horners, great, deep sea tramps,\nwhose iron-shod forefeet had parted every ocean the world round from\nRangoon to Rio Janeiro, and from Melbourne to Christiania. Some were\nstill in the stream, loaded with wheat to the Plimsoll mark, ready\nto depart with the next tide. But many others laid their great flanks\nalongside the docks and at that moment were being filled by derrick\nand crane with thousands upon thousands of bags of wheat. The scene was\nbrisk; the cranes creaked and swung incessantly with a rattle of\nchains; stevedores and wharfingers toiled and perspired; boatswains\nand dock-masters shouted orders, drays rumbled, the water lapped at\nthe piles; a group of sailors, painting the flanks of one of the great\nships, raised an occasional chanty; the trade wind sang aeolian in the\ncordages, filling the air with the nimble taint of salt. All around were\nthe noises of ships and the feel and flavor of the sea.\n\nS. Behrman soon discovered his elevator. It was the largest structure\ndiscernible, and upon its red roof, in enormous white letters, was his\nown name. Thither, between piles of grain bags, halted drays, crates\nand boxes of merchandise, with an occasional pyramid of salmon cases, S.\nBehrman took his way. Cabled to the dock, close under his elevator, lay\na great ship with lofty masts and great spars. Her stern was toward him\nas he approached, and upon it, in raised golden letters, he could read\nthe words “Swanhilda--Liverpool.”\n\nHe went aboard by a very steep gangway and found the mate on the quarter\ndeck. S. Behrman introduced himself.\n\n“Well,” he added, “how are you getting on?”\n\n“Very fairly, sir,” returned the mate, who was an Englishman. “We'll\nhave her all snugged down tight by this time, day after to-morrow. It's\na great saving of time shunting the stuff in her like that, and three\nmen can do the work of seven.”\n\n“I'll have a look 'round, I believe,” returned S. Behrman.\n\n“Right--oh,” answered the mate with a nod.\n\nS. Behrman went forward to the hatch that opened down into the vast hold\nof the ship. A great iron chute connected this hatch with the elevator,\nand through it was rushing a veritable cataract of wheat.\n\nIt came from some gigantic bin within the elevator itself, rushing down\nthe confines of the chute to plunge into the roomy, gloomy interior\nof the hold with an incessant, metallic roar, persistent, steady,\ninevitable. No men were in sight. The place was deserted. No human\nagency seemed to be back of the movement of the wheat. Rather, the\ngrain seemed impelled with a force of its own, a resistless, huge force,\neager, vivid, impatient for the sea.\n\nS. Behrman stood watching, his ears deafened with the roar of the hard\ngrains against the metallic lining of the chute. He put his hand once\ninto the rushing tide, and the contact rasped the flesh of his fingers\nand like an undertow drew his hand after it in its impetuous dash.\n\nCautiously he peered down into the hold. A musty odour rose to his\nnostrils, the vigorous, pungent aroma of the raw cereal. It was dark. He\ncould see nothing; but all about and over the opening of the hatch the\nair was full of a fine, impalpable dust that blinded the eyes and choked\nthe throat and nostrils.\n\nAs his eyes became used to the shadows of the cavern below him, he\nbegan to distinguish the grey mass of the wheat, a great expanse, almost\nliquid in its texture, which, as the cataract from above plunged into\nit, moved and shifted in long, slow eddies. As he stood there, this\ncataract on a sudden increased in volume. He turned about, casting his\neyes upward toward the elevator to discover the cause. His foot caught\nin a coil of rope, and he fell headforemost into the hold.\n\nThe fall was a long one and he struck the surface of the wheat with\nthe sodden impact of a bundle of damp clothes. For the moment he was\nstunned. All the breath was driven from his body. He could neither\nmove nor cry out. But, by degrees, his wits steadied themselves and his\nbreath returned to him. He looked about and above him. The daylight in\nthe hold was dimmed and clouded by the thick, chaff-dust thrown off by\nthe pour of grain, and even this dimness dwindled to twilight at a short\ndistance from the opening of the hatch, while the remotest quarters were\nlost in impenetrable blackness. He got upon his feet only to find that\nhe sunk ankle deep in the loose packed mass underfoot.\n\n“Hell,” he muttered, “here's a fix.”\n\nDirectly underneath the chute, the wheat, as it poured in, raised itself\nin a conical mound, but from the sides of this mound it shunted\naway incessantly in thick layers, flowing in all directions with the\nnimbleness of water. Even as S. Behrman spoke, a wave of grain poured\naround his legs and rose rapidly to the level of his knees. He stepped\nquickly back. To stay near the chute would soon bury him to the waist.\n\nNo doubt, there was some other exit from the hold, some companion ladder\nthat led up to the deck. He scuffled and waded across the wheat, groping\nin the dark with outstretched hands. With every inhalation he choked,\nfilling his mouth and nostrils more with dust than with air. At times he\ncould not breathe at all, but gagged and gasped, his lips distended. But\nsearch as he would he could find no outlet to the hold, no stairway,\nno companion ladder. Again and again, staggering along in the black\ndarkness, he bruised his knuckles and forehead against the iron sides\nof the ship. He gave up the attempt to find any interior means of escape\nand returned laboriously to the space under the open hatchway. Already\nhe could see that the level of the wheat was raised.\n\n“God,” he said, “this isn't going to do at all.” He uttered a great\nshout. “Hello, on deck there, somebody. For God's sake.”\n\nThe steady, metallic roar of the pouring wheat drowned out his voice. He\ncould scarcely hear it himself above the rush of the cataract. Besides\nthis, he found it impossible to stay under the hatch. The flying grains\nof wheat, spattering as they fell, stung his face like wind-driven\nparticles of ice. It was a veritable torture; his hands smarted with it.\nOnce he was all but blinded. Furthermore, the succeeding waves of wheat,\nrolling from the mound under the chute, beat him back, swirling and\ndashing against his legs and knees, mounting swiftly higher, carrying\nhim off his feet.\n\nOnce more he retreated, drawing back from beneath the hatch. He stood\nstill for a moment and shouted again. It was in vain. His voice returned\nupon him, unable to penetrate the thunder of the chute, and horrified,\nhe discovered that so soon as he stood motionless upon the wheat, he\nsank into it. Before he knew it, he was knee-deep again, and a long\nswirl of grain sweeping outward from the ever-breaking, ever-reforming\npyramid below the chute, poured around his thighs, immobolising him.\n\nA frenzy of terror suddenly leaped to life within him. The horror of\ndeath, the Fear of The Trap, shook him like a dry reed. Shouting, he\ntore himself free of the wheat and once more scrambled and struggled\ntowards the hatchway. He stumbled as he reached it and fell directly\nbeneath the pour. Like a storm of small shot, mercilessly, pitilessly,\nthe unnumbered multitude of hurtling grains flagellated and beat and\ntore his flesh. Blood streamed from his forehead and, thickening with\nthe powder-like chaff-dust, blinded his eyes. He struggled to his feet\nonce more. An avalanche from the cone of wheat buried him to his thighs.\nHe was forced back and back and back, beating the air, falling, rising,\nhowling for aid. He could no longer see; his eyes, crammed with dust,\nsmarted as if transfixed with needles whenever he opened them. His mouth\nwas full of the dust, his lips were dry with it; thirst tortured him,\nwhile his outcries choked and gagged in his rasped throat.\n\nAnd all the while without stop, incessantly, inexorably, the wheat, as\nif moving with a force all its own, shot downward in a prolonged roar,\npersistent, steady, inevitable.\n\nHe retreated to a far corner of the hold and sat down with his back\nagainst the iron hull of the ship and tried to collect his thoughts, to\ncalm himself. Surely there must be some way of escape; surely he was not\nto die like this, die in this dreadful substance that was neither solid\nnor fluid. What was he to do? How make himself heard?\n\nBut even as he thought about this, the cone under the chute broke again\nand sent a great layer of grain rippling and tumbling toward him. It\nreached him where he sat and buried his hand and one foot.\n\nHe sprang up trembling and made for another corner.\n\n“By God,” he cried, “by God, I must think of something pretty quick!”\n\nOnce more the level of the wheat rose and the grains began piling deeper\nabout him. Once more he retreated. Once more he crawled staggering to\nthe foot of the cataract, screaming till his ears sang and his eyeballs\nstrained in their sockets, and once more the relentless tide drove him\nback.\n\nThen began that terrible dance of death; the man dodging, doubling,\nsquirming, hunted from one corner to another, the wheat slowly,\ninexorably flowing, rising, spreading to every angle, to every nook\nand cranny. It reached his middle. Furious and with bleeding hands and\nbroken nails, he dug his way out to fall backward, all but exhausted,\ngasping for breath in the dust-thickened air. Roused again by the slow\nadvance of the tide, he leaped up and stumbled away, blinded with the\nagony in his eyes, only to crash against the metal hull of the vessel.\nHe turned about, the blood streaming from his face, and paused to\ncollect his senses, and with a rush, another wave swirled about his\nankles and knees. Exhaustion grew upon him. To stand still meant to\nsink; to lie or sit meant to be buried the quicker; and all this in the\ndark, all this in an air that could scarcely be breathed, all this while\nhe fought an enemy that could not be gripped, toiling in a sea that\ncould not be stayed.\n\nGuided by the sound of the falling wheat, S. Behrman crawled on hands\nand knees toward the hatchway. Once more he raised his voice in a shout\nfor help. His bleeding throat and raw, parched lips refused to utter\nbut a wheezing moan. Once more he tried to look toward the one patch of\nfaint light above him. His eye-lids, clogged with chaff, could no longer\nopen. The Wheat poured about his waist as he raised himself upon his\nknees.\n\nReason fled. Deafened with the roar of the grain, blinded and made dumb\nwith its chaff, he threw himself forward with clutching fingers, rolling\nupon his back, and lay there, moving feebly, the head rolling from side\nto side. The Wheat, leaping continuously from the chute, poured around\nhim. It filled the pockets of the coat, it crept up the sleeves and\ntrouser legs, it covered the great, protuberant stomach, it ran at last\nin rivulets into the distended, gasping mouth. It covered the face. Upon\nthe surface of the Wheat, under the chute, nothing moved but the Wheat\nitself. There was no sign of life. Then, for an instant, the surface\nstirred. A hand, fat, with short fingers and swollen veins, reached up,\nclutching, then fell limp and prone. In another instant it was covered.\nIn the hold of the “Swanhilda” there was no movement but the widening\nripples that spread flowing from the ever-breaking, ever-reforming\ncone; no sound, but the rushing of the Wheat that continued to plunge\nincessantly from the iron chute in a prolonged roar, persistent, steady,\ninevitable.\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe “Swanhilda” cast off from the docks at Port Costa two days after\nPresley had left Bonneville and the ranches and made her way up to San\nFrancisco, anchoring in the stream off the City front. A few hours after\nher arrival, Presley, waiting at his club, received a despatch from\nCedarquist to the effect that she would clear early the next morning and\nthat he must be aboard of her before midnight.\n\nHe sent his trunks aboard and at once hurried to Cedarquist's office to\nsay good-bye. He found the manufacturer in excellent spirits.\n\n“What do you think of Lyman Derrick now, Presley?” he said, when Presley\nhad sat down. “He's in the new politics with a vengeance, isn't he? And\nour own dear Railroad openly acknowledges him as their candidate. You've\nheard of his canvass.”\n\n“Yes, yes,” answered Presley. “Well, he knows his business best.”\n\nBut Cedarquist was full of another idea: his new venture--the organizing\nof a line of clipper wheat ships for Pacific and Oriental trade--was\nprospering.\n\n“The 'Swanhilda' is the mother of the fleet, Pres. I had to buy HER, but\nthe keel of her sister ship will be laid by the time she discharges at\nCalcutta. We'll carry our wheat into Asia yet. The Anglo-Saxon started\nfrom there at the beginning of everything and it's manifest destiny that\nhe must circle the globe and fetch up where he began his march. You are\nup with procession, Pres, going to India this way in a wheat ship that\nflies American colours. By the way, do you know where the money is to\ncome from to build the sister ship of the 'Swanhilda'? From the sale\nof the plant and scrap iron of the Atlas Works. Yes, I've given it up\ndefinitely, that business. The people here would not back me up. But I'm\nworking off on this new line now. It may break me, but we'll try it on.\nYou know the 'Million Dollar Fair' was formally opened yesterday. There\nis,” he added with a wink, “a Midway Pleasance in connection with the\nthing. Mrs. Cedarquist and our friend Hartrath 'got up a subscription'\nto construct a figure of California--heroic size--out of dried apricots.\nI assure you,” he remarked With prodigious gravity, “it is a real work\nof art and quite a 'feature' of the Fair. Well, good luck to you, Pres.\nWrite to me from Honolulu, and bon voyage. My respects to the hungry\nHindoo. Tell him 'we're coming, Father Abraham, a hundred thousand\nmore.' Tell the men of the East to look out for the men of the West. The\nirrepressible Yank is knocking at the doors of their temples and he will\nwant to sell 'em carpet-sweepers for their harems and electric light\nplants for their temple shrines. Good-bye to you.”\n\n“Good-bye, sir.”\n\n“Get fat yourself while you're about it, Presley,” he observed, as the\ntwo stood up and shook hands.\n\n“There shouldn't be any lack of food on a wheat ship. Bread enough,\nsurely.”\n\n“Little monotonous, though. 'Man cannot live by bread alone.' Well,\nyou're really off. Good-bye.”\n\n“Good-bye, sir.”\n\nAnd as Presley issued from the building and stepped out into the street,\nhe was abruptly aware of a great wagon shrouded in white cloth, inside\nof which a bass drum was being furiously beaten. On the cloth, in great\nletters, were the words:\n\n“Vote for Lyman Derrick, Regular Republican Nominee for Governor of\nCalifornia.”\n\n*****\n\nThe “Swanhilda” lifted and rolled slowly, majestically on the ground\nswell of the Pacific, the water hissing and boiling under her forefoot,\nher cordage vibrating and droning in the steady rush of the trade winds.\nIt was drawing towards evening and her lights had just been set.\nThe master passed Presley, who was leaning over the rail smoking a\ncigarette, and paused long enough to remark:\n\n“The land yonder, if you can make it out, is Point Gordo, and if you\nwere to draw a line from our position now through that point and carry\nit on about a hundred miles further, it would just about cross Tulare\nCounty not very far from where you used to live.”\n\n“I see,” answered Presley, “I see. Thanks. I am glad to know that.”\n\nThe master passed on, and Presley, going up to the quarter deck, looked\nlong and earnestly at the faint line of mountains that showed vague and\nbluish above the waste of tumbling water.\n\nThose were the mountains of the Coast range and beyond them was what\nonce had been his home. Bonneville was there, and Guadalajara and\nLos Muertos and Quien Sabe, the Mission of San Juan, the Seed ranch,\nAnnixter's desolated home and Dyke's ruined hop-fields.\n\nWell, it was all over now, that terrible drama through which he had\nlived. Already it was far distant from him; but once again it rose in\nhis memory, portentous, sombre, ineffaceable. He passed it all in review\nfrom the day of his first meeting with Vanamee to the day of his parting\nwith Hilma. He saw it all--the great sweep of country opening to view\nfrom the summit of the hills at the head waters of Broderson's Creek;\nthe barn dance at Annixter's, the harness room with its jam of furious\nmen; the quiet garden of the Mission; Dyke's house, his flight upon the\nengine, his brave fight in the chaparral; Lyman Derrick at bay in the\ndining-room of the ranch house; the rabbit drive; the fight at the\nirrigating ditch, the shouting mob in the Bonneville Opera House. The\ndrama was over. The fight of Ranch and Railroad had been wrought out\nto its dreadful close. It was true, as Shelgrim had said, that forces\nrather than men had locked horns in that struggle, but for all that the\nmen of the Ranch and not the men of the Railroad had suffered. Into the\nprosperous valley, into the quiet community of farmers, that galloping\nmonster, that terror of steel and steam had burst, shooting athwart the\nhorizons, flinging the echo of its thunder over all the ranches of the\nvalley, leaving blood and destruction in its path.\n\nYes, the Railroad had prevailed. The ranches had been seized in the\ntentacles of the octopus; the iniquitous burden of extortionate freight\nrates had been imposed like a yoke of iron. The monster had killed\nHarran, had killed Osterman, had killed Broderson, had killed Hooven. It\nhad beggared Magnus and had driven him to a state of semi-insanity after\nhe had wrecked his honour in the vain attempt to do evil that good might\ncome. It had enticed Lyman into its toils to pluck from him his manhood\nand his honesty, corrupting him and poisoning him beyond redemption; it\nhad hounded Dyke from his legitimate employment and had made of him\na highwayman and criminal. It had cast forth Mrs. Hooven to starve to\ndeath upon the City streets. It had driven Minna to prostitution. It had\nslain Annixter at the very moment when painfully and manfully he had at\nlast achieved his own salvation and stood forth resolved to do right, to\nact unselfishly and to live for others. It had widowed Hilma in the very\ndawn of her happiness. It had killed the very babe within the mother's\nwomb, strangling life ere yet it had been born, stamping out the spark\nordained by God to burn through all eternity.\n\nWhat then was left? Was there no hope, no outlook for the future, no\nrift in the black curtain, no glimmer through the night? Was good to be\nthus overthrown? Was evil thus to be strong and to prevail? Was nothing\nleft?\n\nThen suddenly Vanamee's words came back to his mind. What was the larger\nview, what contributed the greatest good to the greatest numbers? What\nwas the full round of the circle whose segment only he beheld? In the\nend, the ultimate, final end of all, what was left? Yes, good issued\nfrom this crisis, untouched, unassailable, undefiled.\n\nMen--motes in the sunshine--perished, were shot down in the very noon\nof life, hearts were broken, little children started in life lamentably\nhandicapped; young girls were brought to a life of shame; old women died\nin the heart of life for lack of food. In that little, isolated group of\nhuman insects, misery, death, and anguish spun like a wheel of fire.\n\nBUT THE WHEAT REMAINED. Untouched, unassailable, undefiled, that mighty\nworld-force, that nourisher of nations, wrapped in Nirvanic calm,\nindifferent to the human swarm, gigantic, resistless, moved onward in\nits appointed grooves. Through the welter of blood at the irrigation\nditch, through the sham charity and shallow philanthropy of famine\nrelief committees, the great harvest of Los Muertos rolled like a\nflood from the Sierras to the Himalayas to feed thousands of starving\nscarecrows on the barren plains of India.\n\nFalseness dies; injustice and oppression in the end of everything\nfade and vanish away. Greed, cruelty, selfishness, and inhumanity are\nshort-lived; the individual suffers, but the race goes on. Annixter\ndies, but in a far distant corner of the world a thousand lives are\nsaved. The larger view always and through all shams, all wickednesses,\ndiscovers the Truth that will, in the end, prevail, and all things,\nsurely, inevitably, resistlessly work together for good.",
