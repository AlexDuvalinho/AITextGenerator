It belongs to\nHugo’s cousins, and you can get it for a song.”\n\nThe reasons she gave for its being obtainable on these terms--its\nremoteness from a station, its lack of electric light, hot-water pipes,\nand other vulgar necessities--were exactly those pleading in its\nfavor with two romantic Americans perversely in search of the economic\ndrawbacks which were associated, in their tradition, with unusual\narchitectural felicities.\n\n“I should never believe I was living in an old house unless I was\nthoroughly uncomfortable,” Ned Boyne, the more extravagant of the two,\nhad jocosely insisted; “the least hint of ‘convenience’ would make me\nthink it had been bought out of an exhibition, with the pieces numbered,\nand set up again.” And they had proceeded to enumerate, with humorous\nprecision, their various suspicions and exactions, refusing to believe\nthat the house their cousin recommended was REALLY Tudor till they\nlearned it had no heating system, or that the village church was\nliterally in the grounds till she assured them of the deplorable\nuncertainty of the water-supply.\n\n“It’s too uncomfortable to be true!” Edward Boyne had continued to exult\nas the avowal of each disadvantage was successively wrung from her; but\nhe had cut short his rhapsody to ask, with a sudden relapse to distrust:\n“And the ghost? You’ve been concealing from us the fact that there is no\nghost!”\n\nMary, at the moment, had laughed with him, yet almost with her laugh,\nbeing possessed of several sets of independent perceptions, had noted a\nsudden flatness of tone in Alida’s answering hilarity.\n\n“Oh, Dorsetshire’s full of ghosts, you know.”\n\n“Yes, yes; but that won’t do. I don’t want to have to drive ten miles\nto see somebody else’s ghost. I want one of my own on the premises. IS\nthere a ghost at Lyng?”\n\nHis rejoinder had made Alida laugh again, and it was then that she had\nflung back tantalizingly: “Oh, there IS one, of course, but you’ll never\nknow it.”\n\n“Never know it?” Boyne pulled her up. “But what in the world constitutes\na ghost except the fact of its being known for one?”\n\n“I can’t say. But that’s the story.”\n\n“That there’s a ghost, but that nobody knows it’s a ghost?”\n\n“Well--not till afterward, at any rate.”\n\n“Till afterward?”\n\n“Not till long, long afterward.”\n\n“But if it’s once been identified as an unearthly visitant, why hasn’t\nits signalement been handed down in the family? How has it managed to\npreserve its incognito?”\n\nAlida could only shake her head. “Don’t ask me. But it has.”\n\n“And then suddenly--” Mary spoke up as if from some cavernous depth of\ndivination--“suddenly, long afterward, one says to one’s self, ‘THAT WAS\nit?’”\n\nShe was oddly startled at the sepulchral sound with which her question\nfell on the banter of the other two, and she saw the shadow of the same\nsurprise flit across Alida’s clear pupils. “I suppose so. One just has\nto wait.”\n\n“Oh, hang waiting!” Ned broke in. “Life’s too short for a ghost who can\nonly be enjoyed in retrospect. Can’t we do better than that, Mary?”\n\nBut it turned out that in the event they were not destined to, for\nwithin three months of their conversation with Mrs. Stair they were\nestablished at Lyng, and the life they had yearned for to the point of\nplanning it out in all its daily details had actually begun for them.\n\nIt was to sit, in the thick December dusk, by just such a wide-hooded\nfireplace, under just such black oak rafters, with the sense that beyond\nthe mullioned panes the downs were darkening to a deeper solitude: it\nwas for the ultimate indulgence in such sensations that Mary Boyne had\nendured for nearly fourteen years the soul-deadening ugliness of the\nMiddle West, and that Boyne had ground on doggedly at his engineering\ntill, with a suddenness that still made her blink, the prodigious\nwindfall of the Blue Star Mine had put them at a stroke in possession\nof life and the leisure to taste it. They had never for a moment meant\ntheir new state to be one of idleness; but they meant to give themselves\nonly to harmonious activities. She had her vision of painting and\ngardening (against a background of gray walls), he dreamed of the\nproduction of his long-planned book on the “Economic Basis of\nCulture”; and with such absorbing work ahead no existence could be too\nsequestered; they could not get far enough from the world, or plunge\ndeep enough into the past.\n\nDorsetshire had attracted them from the first by a semblance of\nremoteness out of all proportion to its geographical position. But\nto the Boynes it was one of the ever-recurring wonders of the whole\nincredibly compressed island--a nest of counties, as they put it--that\nfor the production of its effects so little of a given quality went\nso far: that so few miles made a distance, and so short a distance a\ndifference.\n\n“It’s that,” Ned had once enthusiastically explained, “that gives such\ndepth to their effects, such relief to their least contrasts. They’ve\nbeen able to lay the butter so thick on every exquisite mouthful.”\n\nThe butter had certainly been laid on thick at Lyng: the old gray house,\nhidden under a shoulder of the downs, had almost all the finer marks of\ncommerce with a protracted past. The mere fact that it was neither large\nnor exceptional made it, to the Boynes, abound the more richly in\nits special sense--the sense of having been for centuries a deep, dim\nreservoir of life. The life had probably not been of the most vivid\norder: for long periods, no doubt, it had fallen as noiselessly into\nthe past as the quiet drizzle of autumn fell, hour after hour, into the\ngreen fish-pond between the yews; but these back-waters of existence\nsometimes breed, in their sluggish depths, strange acuities of emotion,\nand Mary Boyne had felt from the first the occasional brush of an\nintenser memory.\n\nThe feeling had never been stronger than on the December afternoon when,\nwaiting in the library for the belated lamps, she rose from her seat and\nstood among the shadows of the hearth. Her husband had gone off, after\nluncheon, for one of his long tramps on the downs. She had noticed of\nlate that he preferred to be unaccompanied on these occasions; and,\nin the tried security of their personal relations, had been driven\nto conclude that his book was bothering him, and that he needed the\nafternoons to turn over in solitude the problems left from the morning’s\nwork. Certainly the book was not going as smoothly as she had imagined\nit would, and the lines of perplexity between his eyes had never been\nthere in his engineering days. Then he had often looked fagged to the\nverge of illness, but the native demon of “worry” had never branded his\nbrow. Yet the few pages he had so far read to her--the introduction, and\na synopsis of the opening chapter--gave evidences of a firm possession\nof his subject, and a deepening confidence in his powers.\n\nThe fact threw her into deeper perplexity, since, now that he had done\nwith “business” and its disturbing contingencies, the one other possible\nelement of anxiety was eliminated. Unless it were his health, then?\nBut physically he had gained since they had come to Dorsetshire, grown\nrobuster, ruddier, and fresher-eyed. It was only within a week that she\nhad felt in him the undefinable change that made her restless in his\nabsence, and as tongue-tied in his presence as though it were SHE who\nhad a secret to keep from him!\n\nThe thought that there WAS a secret somewhere between them struck her\nwith a sudden smart rap of wonder, and she looked about her down the\ndim, long room.\n\n“Can it be the house?” she mused.\n\nThe room itself might have been full of secrets. They seemed to be\npiling themselves up, as evening fell, like the layers and layers of\nvelvet shadow dropping from the low ceiling, the dusky walls of books,\nthe smoke-blurred sculpture of the hooded hearth.\n\n“Why, of course--the house is haunted!” she reflected.\n\nThe ghost--Alida’s imperceptible ghost--after figuring largely in the\nbanter of their first month or two at Lyng, had been gradually discarded\nas too ineffectual for imaginative use. Mary had, indeed, as became the\ntenant of a haunted house, made the customary inquiries among her few\nrural neighbors, but, beyond a vague, “They du say so, Ma’am,” the\nvillagers had nothing to impart. The elusive specter had apparently\nnever had sufficient identity for a legend to crystallize about it,\nand after a time the Boynes had laughingly set the matter down to their\nprofit-and-loss account, agreeing that Lyng was one of the few houses\ngood enough in itself to dispense with supernatural enhancements.\n\n“And I suppose, poor, ineffectual demon, that’s why it beats its\nbeautiful wings in vain in the void,” Mary had laughingly concluded.\n\n“Or, rather,” Ned answered, in the same strain, “why, amid so much\nthat’s ghostly, it can never affirm its separate existence as THE\nghost.” And thereupon their invisible housemate had finally dropped out\nof their references, which were numerous enough to make them promptly\nunaware of the loss.\n\nNow, as she stood on the hearth, the subject of their earlier curiosity\nrevived in her with a new sense of its meaning--a sense gradually\nacquired through close daily contact with the scene of the lurking\nmystery. It was the house itself, of course, that possessed the\nghost-seeing faculty, that communed visually but secretly with its own\npast; and if one could only get into close enough communion with the\nhouse, one might surprise its secret, and acquire the ghost-sight on\none’s own account. Perhaps, in his long solitary hours in this very\nroom, where she never trespassed till the afternoon, her husband HAD\nacquired it already, and was silently carrying the dread weight of\nwhatever it had revealed to him. Mary was too well-versed in the code of\nthe spectral world not to know that one could not talk about the ghosts\none saw: to do so was almost as great a breach of good-breeding as to\nname a lady in a club. But this explanation did not really satisfy her.\n“What, after all, except for the fun of the frisson,” she reflected,\n“would he really care for any of their old ghosts?” And thence she was\nthrown back once more on the fundamental dilemma: the fact that one’s\ngreater or less susceptibility to spectral influences had no particular\nbearing on the case, since, when one DID see a ghost at Lyng, one did\nnot know it.\n\n“Not till long afterward,” Alida Stair had said. Well, supposing Ned HAD\nseen one when they first came, and had known only within the last week\nwhat had happened to him? More and more under the spell of the hour, she\nthrew back her searching thoughts to the early days of their tenancy,\nbut at first only to recall a gay confusion of unpacking, settling,\narranging of books, and calling to each other from remote corners of the\nhouse as treasure after treasure of their habitation revealed itself to\nthem. It was in this particular connection that she presently recalled\na certain soft afternoon of the previous October, when, passing from the\nfirst rapturous flurry of exploration to a detailed inspection of the\nold house, she had pressed (like a novel heroine) a panel that opened at\nher touch, on a narrow flight of stairs leading to an unsuspected flat\nledge of the roof--the roof which, from below, seemed to slope away on\nall sides too abruptly for any but practised feet to scale.\n\nThe view from this hidden coign was enchanting, and she had flown down\nto snatch Ned from his papers and give him the freedom of her discovery.\nShe remembered still how, standing on the narrow ledge, he had passed\nhis arm about her while their gaze flew to the long, tossed horizon-line\nof the downs, and then dropped contentedly back to trace the arabesque\nof yew hedges about the fish-pond, and the shadow of the cedar on the\nlawn.\n\n“And now the other way,” he had said, gently turning her about within\nhis arm; and closely pressed to him, she had absorbed, like some long,\nsatisfying draft, the picture of the gray-walled court, the squat lions\non the gates, and the lime-avenue reaching up to the highroad under the\ndowns.\n\nIt was just then, while they gazed and held each other, that she had\nfelt his arm relax, and heard a sharp “Hullo!” that made her turn to\nglance at him.\n\nDistinctly, yes, she now recalled she had seen, as she glanced, a shadow\nof anxiety, of perplexity, rather, fall across his face; and, following\nhis eyes, had beheld the figure of a man--a man in loose, grayish\nclothes, as it appeared to her--who was sauntering down the lime-avenue\nto the court with the tentative gait of a stranger seeking his way. Her\nshort-sighted eyes had given her but a blurred impression of slightness\nand grayness, with something foreign, or at least unlocal, in the cut of\nthe figure or its garb; but her husband had apparently seen more--seen\nenough to make him push past her with a sharp “Wait!” and dash down the\ntwisting stairs without pausing to give her a hand for the descent.\n\nA slight tendency to dizziness obliged her, after a provisional clutch\nat the chimney against which they had been leaning, to follow him down\nmore cautiously; and when she had reached the attic landing she paused\nagain for a less definite reason, leaning over the oak banister to\nstrain her eyes through the silence of the brown, sun-flecked depths\nbelow. She lingered there till, somewhere in those depths, she heard\nthe closing of a door; then, mechanically impelled, she went down the\nshallow flights of steps till she reached the lower hall.\n\nThe front door stood open on the mild sunlight of the court, and\nhall and court were empty. The library door was open, too, and after\nlistening in vain for any sound of voices within, she quickly crossed\nthe threshold, and found her husband alone, vaguely fingering the papers\non his desk.\n\nHe looked up, as if surprised at her precipitate entrance, but the\nshadow of anxiety had passed from his face, leaving it even, as she\nfancied, a little brighter and clearer than usual.\n\n“What was it? Who was it?” she asked.\n\n“Who?” he repeated, with the surprise still all on his side.\n\n“The man we saw coming toward the house.”\n\nHe seemed honestly to reflect. “The man? Why, I thought I saw Peters;\nI dashed after him to say a word about the stable-drains, but he had\ndisappeared before I could get down.”\n\n“Disappeared? Why, he seemed to be walking so slowly when we saw him.”\n\nBoyne shrugged his shoulders. “So I thought; but he must have got up\nsteam in the interval. What do you say to our trying a scramble up\nMeldon Steep before sunset?”\n\nThat was all. At the time the occurrence had been less than nothing,\nhad, indeed, been immediately obliterated by the magic of their first\nvision from Meldon Steep, a height which they had dreamed of climbing\never since they had first seen its bare spine heaving itself above the\nlow roof of Lyng. Doubtless it was the mere fact of the other incident’s\nhaving occurred on the very day of their ascent to Meldon that had kept\nit stored away in the unconscious fold of association from which it now\nemerged; for in itself it had no mark of the portentous. At the moment\nthere could have been nothing more natural than that Ned should dash\nhimself from the roof in the pursuit of dilatory tradesmen. It was the\nperiod when they were always on the watch for one or the other of the\nspecialists employed about the place; always lying in wait for them,\nand dashing out at them with questions, reproaches, or reminders. And\ncertainly in the distance the gray figure had looked like Peters.\n\nYet now, as she reviewed the rapid scene, she felt her husband’s\nexplanation of it to have been invalidated by the look of anxiety on his\nface. Why had the familiar appearance of Peters made him anxious?\nWhy, above all, if it was of such prime necessity to confer with that\nauthority on the subject of the stable-drains, had the failure to find\nhim produced such a look of relief? Mary could not say that any one\nof these considerations had occurred to her at the time, yet, from the\npromptness with which they now marshaled themselves at her summons, she\nhad a sudden sense that they must all along have been there, waiting\ntheir hour.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nWeary with her thoughts, she moved toward the window. The library was\nnow completely dark, and she was surprised to see how much faint light\nthe outer world still held.\n\nAs she peered out into it across the court, a figure shaped itself in\nthe tapering perspective of bare lines: it looked a mere blot of deeper\ngray in the grayness, and for an instant, as it moved toward her, her\nheart thumped to the thought, “It’s the ghost!”\n\nShe had time, in that long instant, to feel suddenly that the man of\nwhom, two months earlier, she had a brief distant vision from the roof\nwas now, at his predestined hour, about to reveal himself as NOT\nhaving been Peters; and her spirit sank under the impending fear of the\ndisclosure. But almost with the next tick of the clock the ambiguous\nfigure, gaining substance and character, showed itself even to her weak\nsight as her husband’s; and she turned away to meet him, as he entered,\nwith the confession of her folly.\n\n“It’s really too absurd,” she laughed out from the threshold, “but I\nnever CAN remember!”\n\n“Remember what?” Boyne questioned as they drew together.\n\n“That when one sees the Lyng ghost one never knows it.”\n\nHer hand was on his sleeve, and he kept it there, but with no response\nin his gesture or in the lines of his fagged, preoccupied face.\n\n“Did you think you’d seen it?” he asked, after an appreciable interval.\n\n“Why, I actually took YOU for it, my dear, in my mad determination to\nspot it!”\n\n“Me--just now?” His arm dropped away, and he turned from her with a\nfaint echo of her laugh. “Really, dearest, you’d better give it up, if\nthat’s the best you can do.”\n\n“Yes, I give it up--I give it up. Have YOU?” she asked, turning round on\nhim abruptly.\n\nThe parlor-maid had entered with letters and a lamp, and the light\nstruck up into Boyne’s face as he bent above the tray she presented.\n\n“Have YOU?” Mary perversely insisted, when the servant had disappeared\non her errand of illumination.\n\n“Have I what?” he rejoined absently, the light bringing out the sharp\nstamp of worry between his brows as he turned over the letters.\n\n“Given up trying to see the ghost.” Her heart beat a little at the\nexperiment she was making.\n\nHer husband, laying his letters aside, moved away into the shadow of the\nhearth.\n\n“I never tried,” he said, tearing open the wrapper of a newspaper.\n\n“Well, of course,” Mary persisted, “the exasperating thing is that\nthere’s no use trying, since one can’t be sure till so long afterward.”\n\nHe was unfolding the paper as if he had hardly heard her; but after a\npause, during which the sheets rustled spasmodically between his hands,\nhe lifted his head to say abruptly, “Have you any idea HOW LONG?”\n\nMary had sunk into a low chair beside the fireplace. From her seat\nshe looked up, startled, at her husband’s profile, which was darkly\nprojected against the circle of lamplight.\n\n“No; none. Have YOU?” she retorted, repeating her former phrase with an\nadded keenness of intention.\n\nBoyne crumpled the paper into a bunch, and then inconsequently turned\nback with it toward the lamp.\n\n“Lord, no! I only meant,” he explained, with a faint tinge of\nimpatience, “is there any legend, any tradition, as to that?”\n\n“Not that I know of,” she answered; but the impulse to add, “What makes\nyou ask?” was checked by the reappearance of the parlor-maid with tea\nand a second lamp.\n\nWith the dispersal of shadows, and the repetition of the daily domestic\noffice, Mary Boyne felt herself less oppressed by that sense of\nsomething mutely imminent which had darkened her solitary afternoon. For\na few moments she gave herself silently to the details of her task, and\nwhen she looked up from it she was struck to the point of bewilderment\nby the change in her husband’s face. He had seated himself near the\nfarther lamp, and was absorbed in the perusal of his letters; but was it\nsomething he had found in them, or merely the shifting of her own point\nof view, that had restored his features to their normal aspect? The\nlonger she looked, the more definitely the change affirmed itself. The\nlines of painful tension had vanished, and such traces of fatigue as\nlingered were of the kind easily attributable to steady mental effort.\nHe glanced up, as if drawn by her gaze, and met her eyes with a smile.\n\n“I’m dying for my tea, you know; and here’s a letter for you,” he said.\n\nShe took the letter he held out in exchange for the cup she proffered\nhim, and, returning to her seat, broke the seal with the languid gesture\nof the reader whose interests are all inclosed in the circle of one\ncherished presence.\n\nHer next conscious motion was that of starting to her feet, the letter\nfalling to them as she rose, while she held out to her husband a long\nnewspaper clipping.\n\n“Ned! What’s this? What does it mean?”\n\nHe had risen at the same instant, almost as if hearing her cry before\nshe uttered it; and for a perceptible space of time he and she studied\neach other, like adversaries watching for an advantage, across the space\nbetween her chair and his desk.\n\n“What’s what? You fairly made me jump!” Boyne said at length, moving\ntoward her with a sudden, half-exasperated laugh. The shadow of\napprehension was on his face again, not now a look of fixed foreboding,\nbut a shifting vigilance of lips and eyes that gave her the sense of his\nfeeling himself invisibly surrounded.\n\nHer hand shook so that she could hardly give him the clipping.\n\n“This article--from the ‘Waukesha Sentinel’--that a man named Elwell has\nbrought suit against you--that there was something wrong about the Blue\nStar Mine. I can’t understand more than half.”\n\nThey continued to face each other as she spoke, and to her astonishment,\nshe saw that her words had the almost immediate effect of dissipating\nthe strained watchfulness of his look.\n\n“Oh, THAT!” He glanced down the printed slip, and then folded it with\nthe gesture of one who handles something harmless and familiar. “What’s\nthe matter with you this afternoon, Mary? I thought you’d got bad news.”\n\nShe stood before him with her undefinable terror subsiding slowly under\nthe reassuring touch of his composure.\n\n“You knew about this, then--it’s all right?”\n\n“Certainly I knew about it; and it’s all right.”\n\n“But what IS it? I don’t understand. What does this man accuse you of?”\n\n“Oh, pretty nearly every crime in the calendar.” Boyne had tossed the\nclipping down, and thrown himself comfortably into an arm-chair near\nthe fire. “Do you want to hear the story? It’s not particularly\ninteresting--just a squabble over interests in the Blue Star.”\n\n“But who is this Elwell? I don’t know the name.”\n\n“Oh, he’s a fellow I put into it--gave him a hand up. I told you all\nabout him at the time.”\n\n“I daresay. I must have forgotten.” Vainly she strained back among her\nmemories. “But if you helped him, why does he make this return?”\n\n“Oh, probably some shyster lawyer got hold of him and talked him over.\nIt’s all rather technical and complicated. I thought that kind of thing\nbored you.”\n\nHis wife felt a sting of compunction. Theoretically, she deprecated the\nAmerican wife’s detachment from her husband’s professional interests,\nbut in practice she had always found it difficult to fix her attention\non Boyne’s report of the transactions in which his varied interests\ninvolved him. Besides, she had felt from the first that, in a community\nwhere the amenities of living could be obtained only at the cost of\nefforts as arduous as her husband’s professional labors, such brief\nleisure as they could command should be used as an escape from immediate\npreoccupations, a flight to the life they always dreamed of living. Once\nor twice, now that this new life had actually drawn its magic circle\nabout them, she had asked herself if she had done right; but hitherto\nsuch conjectures had been no more than the retrospective excursions of\nan active fancy. Now, for the first time, it startled her a little\nto find how little she knew of the material foundation on which her\nhappiness was built.\n\nShe glanced again at her husband, and was reassured by the composure\nof his face; yet she felt the need of more definite grounds for her\nreassurance.\n\n“But doesn’t this suit worry you? Why have you never spoken to me about\nit?”\n\nHe answered both questions at once: “I didn’t speak of it at first\nbecause it DID worry me--annoyed me, rather. But it’s all ancient\nhistory now. Your correspondent must have got hold of a back number of\nthe ‘Sentinel.’”\n\nShe felt a quick thrill of relief. “You mean it’s over? He’s lost his\ncase?”\n\nThere was a just perceptible delay in Boyne’s reply. “The suit’s been\nwithdrawn--that’s all.”\n\nBut she persisted, as if to exonerate herself from the inward charge of\nbeing too easily put off. “Withdrawn because he saw he had no chance?”\n\n“Oh, he had no chance,” Boyne answered.\n\nShe was still struggling with a dimly felt perplexity at the back of her\nthoughts.\n\n“How long ago was it withdrawn?”\n\nHe paused, as if with a slight return of his former uncertainty. “I’ve\njust had the news now; but I’ve been expecting it.”\n\n“Just now--in one of your letters?”\n\n“Yes; in one of my letters.”\n\nShe made no answer, and was aware only, after a short interval of\nwaiting, that he had risen, and strolling across the room, had placed\nhimself on the sofa at her side. She felt him, as he did so, pass an arm\nabout her, she felt his hand seek hers and clasp it, and turning slowly,\ndrawn by the warmth of his cheek, she met the smiling clearness of his\neyes.\n\n“It’s all right--it’s all right?” she questioned, through the flood of\nher dissolving doubts; and “I give you my word it never was righter!” he\nlaughed back at her, holding her close.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nOne of the strangest things she was afterward to recall out of all the\nnext day’s incredible strangeness was the sudden and complete recovery\nof her sense of security.\n\nIt was in the air when she woke in her low-ceilinged, dusky room; it\naccompanied her down-stairs to the breakfast-table, flashed out at her\nfrom the fire, and re-duplicated itself brightly from the flanks of the\nurn and the sturdy flutings of the Georgian teapot. It was as if, in\nsome roundabout way, all her diffused apprehensions of the previous\nday, with their moment of sharp concentration about the newspaper\narticle,--as if this dim questioning of the future, and startled return\nupon the past,--had between them liquidated the arrears of some haunting\nmoral obligation. If she had indeed been careless of her husband’s\naffairs, it was, her new state seemed to prove, because her faith in him\ninstinctively justified such carelessness; and his right to her faith\nhad overwhelmingly affirmed itself in the very face of menace and\nsuspicion. She had never seen him more untroubled, more naturally and\nunconsciously in possession of himself, than after the cross-examination\nto which she had subjected him: it was almost as if he had been aware of\nher lurking doubts, and had wanted the air cleared as much as she did.\n\nIt was as clear, thank Heaven! as the bright outer light that surprised\nher almost with a touch of summer when she issued from the house for her\ndaily round of the gardens. She had left Boyne at his desk, indulging\nherself, as she passed the library door, by a last peep at his quiet\nface, where he bent, pipe in his mouth, above his papers, and now she\nhad her own morning’s task to perform. The task involved on such charmed\nwinter days almost as much delighted loitering about the different\nquarters of her demesne as if spring were already at work on shrubs and\nborders. There were such inexhaustible possibilities still before her,\nsuch opportunities to bring out the latent graces of the old place,\nwithout a single irreverent touch of alteration, that the winter months\nwere all too short to plan what spring and autumn executed. And her\nrecovered sense of safety gave, on this particular morning, a peculiar\nzest to her progress through the sweet, still place. She went first to\nthe kitchen-garden, where the espaliered pear-trees drew complicated\npatterns on the walls, and pigeons were fluttering and preening about\nthe silvery-slated roof of their cot. There was something wrong about\nthe piping of the hothouse, and she was expecting an authority from\nDorchester, who was to drive out between trains and make a diagnosis of\nthe boiler. But when she dipped into the damp heat of the greenhouses,\namong the spiced scents and waxy pinks and reds of old-fashioned\nexotics,--even the flora of Lyng was in the note!--she learned that the\ngreat man had not arrived, and the day being too rare to waste in an\nartificial atmosphere, she came out again and paced slowly along the\nspringy turf of the bowling-green to the gardens behind the house. At\ntheir farther end rose a grass terrace, commanding, over the fish-pond\nand the yew hedges, a view of the long house-front, with its twisted\nchimney-stacks and the blue shadows of its roof angles, all drenched in\nthe pale gold moisture of the air.\n\nSeen thus, across the level tracery of the yews, under the suffused,\nmild light, it sent her, from its open windows and hospitably smoking\nchimneys, the look of some warm human presence, of a mind slowly ripened\non a sunny wall of experience. She had never before had so deep a sense\nof her intimacy with it, such a conviction that its secrets were\nall beneficent, kept, as they said to children, “for one’s good,” so\ncomplete a trust in its power to gather up her life and Ned’s into the\nharmonious pattern of the long, long story it sat there weaving in the\nsun.\n\nShe heard steps behind her, and turned, expecting to see the gardener,\naccompanied by the engineer from Dorchester. But only one figure was\nin sight, that of a youngish, slightly built man, who, for reasons she\ncould not on the spot have specified, did not remotely resemble her\npreconceived notion of an authority on hot-house boilers. The\nnew-comer, on seeing her, lifted his hat, and paused with the air of a\ngentleman--perhaps a traveler--desirous of having it immediately known\nthat his intrusion is involuntary. The local fame of Lyng occasionally\nattracted the more intelligent sight-seer, and Mary half-expected to see\nthe stranger dissemble a camera, or justify his presence by producing\nit. But he made no gesture of any sort, and after a moment she asked,\nin a tone responding to the courteous deprecation of his attitude: “Is\nthere any one you wish to see?”\n\n“I came to see Mr. Boyne,” he replied. His intonation, rather than his\naccent, was faintly American, and Mary, at the familiar note, looked\nat him more closely. The brim of his soft felt hat cast a shade on his\nface, which, thus obscured, wore to her short-sighted gaze a look of\nseriousness, as of a person arriving “on business,” and civilly but\nfirmly aware of his rights.\n\nPast experience had made Mary equally sensible to such claims; but she\nwas jealous of her husband’s morning hours, and doubtful of his having\ngiven any one the right to intrude on them.\n\n“Have you an appointment with Mr. Boyne?” she asked.\n\nHe hesitated, as if unprepared for the question.\n\n“Not exactly an appointment,” he replied.\n\n“Then I’m afraid, this being his working-time, that he can’t receive you\nnow. Will you give me a message, or come back later?”\n\nThe visitor, again lifting his hat, briefly replied that he would come\nback later, and walked away, as if to regain the front of the house. As\nhis figure receded down the walk between the yew hedges, Mary saw him\npause and look up an instant at the peaceful house-front bathed in faint\nwinter sunshine; and it struck her, with a tardy touch of compunction,\nthat it would have been more humane to ask if he had come from a\ndistance, and to offer, in that case, to inquire if her husband could\nreceive him. But as the thought occurred to her he passed out of\nsight behind a pyramidal yew, and at the same moment her attention was\ndistracted by the approach of the gardener, attended by the bearded\npepper-and-salt figure of the boiler-maker from Dorchester.\n\nThe encounter with this authority led to such far-reaching issues that\nthey resulted in his finding it expedient to ignore his train, and\nbeguiled Mary into spending the remainder of the morning in absorbed\nconfabulation among the greenhouses. She was startled to find, when the\ncolloquy ended, that it was nearly luncheon-time, and she half expected,\nas she hurried back to the house, to see her husband coming out to meet\nher. But she found no one in the court but an under-gardener raking\nthe gravel, and the hall, when she entered it, was so silent that she\nguessed Boyne to be still at work behind the closed door of the library.\n\nNot wishing to disturb him, she turned into the drawing-room, and there,\nat her writing-table, lost herself in renewed calculations of the outlay\nto which the morning’s conference had committed her. The knowledge that\nshe could permit herself such follies had not yet lost its novelty; and\nsomehow, in contrast to the vague apprehensions of the previous days, it\nnow seemed an element of her recovered security, of the sense that, as\nNed had said, things in general had never been “righter.”\n\nShe was still luxuriating in a lavish play of figures when the\nparlor-maid, from the threshold, roused her with a dubiously worded\ninquiry as to the expediency of serving luncheon. It was one of their\njokes that Trimmle announced luncheon as if she were divulging a\nstate secret, and Mary, intent upon her papers, merely murmured an\nabsent-minded assent.\n\nShe felt Trimmle wavering expressively on the threshold as if in rebuke\nof such offhand acquiescence; then her retreating steps sounded down the\npassage, and Mary, pushing away her papers, crossed the hall, and went\nto the library door. It was still closed, and she wavered in her turn,\ndisliking to disturb her husband, yet anxious that he should not exceed\nhis normal measure of work. As she stood there, balancing her impulses,\nthe esoteric Trimmle returned with the announcement of luncheon, and\nMary, thus impelled, opened the door and went into the library.\n\nBoyne was not at his desk, and she peered about her, expecting to\ndiscover him at the book-shelves, somewhere down the length of the room;\nbut her call brought no response, and gradually it became clear to her\nthat he was not in the library.\n\nShe turned back to the parlor-maid.\n\n“Mr. Boyne must be up-stairs. Please tell him that luncheon is ready.”\n\nThe parlor-maid appeared to hesitate between the obvious duty of obeying\norders and an equally obvious conviction of the foolishness of\nthe injunction laid upon her. The struggle resulted in her saying\ndoubtfully, “If you please, Madam, Mr. Boyne’s not up-stairs.”\n\n“Not in his room? Are you sure?”\n\n“I’m sure, Madam.”\n\nMary consulted the clock. “Where is he, then?”\n\n“He’s gone out,” Trimmle announced, with the superior air of one who has\nrespectfully waited for the question that a well-ordered mind would have\nfirst propounded.\n\nMary’s previous conjecture had been right, then. Boyne must have gone to\nthe gardens to meet her, and since she had missed him, it was clear that\nhe had taken the shorter way by the south door, instead of going round\nto the court. She crossed the hall to the glass portal opening directly\non the yew garden, but the parlor-maid, after another moment of inner\nconflict, decided to bring out recklessly, “Please, Madam, Mr. Boyne\ndidn’t go that way.”\n\nMary turned back. “Where DID he go? And when?”\n\n“He went out of the front door, up the drive, Madam.” It was a matter of\nprinciple with Trimmle never to answer more than one question at a time.\n\n“Up the drive? At this hour?” Mary went to the door herself, and\nglanced across the court through the long tunnel of bare limes. But\nits perspective was as empty as when she had scanned it on entering the\nhouse.\n\n“Did Mr. Boyne leave no message?” she asked.\n\nTrimmle seemed to surrender herself to a last struggle with the forces\nof chaos.\n\n“No, Madam. He just went out with the gentleman.”\n\n“The gentleman? What gentleman?” Mary wheeled about, as if to front this\nnew factor.\n\n“The gentleman who called, Madam,” said Trimmle, resignedly.\n\n“When did a gentleman call? Do explain yourself, Trimmle!”\n\nOnly the fact that Mary was very hungry, and that she wanted to consult\nher husband about the greenhouses, would have caused her to lay so\nunusual an injunction on her attendant; and even now she was detached\nenough to note in Trimmle’s eye the dawning defiance of the respectful\nsubordinate who has been pressed too hard.\n\n“I couldn’t exactly say the hour, Madam, because I didn’t let the\ngentleman in,” she replied, with the air of magnanimously ignoring the\nirregularity of her mistress’s course.\n\n“You didn’t let him in?”\n\n“No, Madam. When the bell rang I was dressing, and Agnes--”\n\n“Go and ask Agnes, then,” Mary interjected. Trimmle still wore her\nlook of patient magnanimity. “Agnes would not know, Madam, for she had\nunfortunately burnt her hand in trying the wick of the new lamp from\ntown--” Trimmle, as Mary was aware, had always been opposed to the new\nlamp--“and so Mrs. Dockett sent the kitchen-maid instead.”\n\nMary looked again at the clock. “It’s after two! Go and ask the\nkitchen-maid if Mr. Boyne left any word.”\n\nShe went into luncheon without waiting, and Trimmle presently brought\nher there the kitchen-maid’s statement that the gentleman had called\nabout one o’clock, that Mr. Boyne had gone out with him without leaving\nany message. The kitchen-maid did not even know the caller’s name, for\nhe had written it on a slip of paper, which he had folded and handed to\nher, with the injunction to deliver it at once to Mr. Boyne.\n\nMary finished her luncheon, still wondering, and when it was over,\nand Trimmle had brought the coffee to the drawing-room, her wonder had\ndeepened to a first faint tinge of disquietude. It was unlike Boyne\nto absent himself without explanation at so unwonted an hour, and the\ndifficulty of identifying the visitor whose summons he had apparently\nobeyed made his disappearance the more unaccountable. Mary Boyne’s\nexperience as the wife of a busy engineer, subject to sudden calls and\ncompelled to keep irregular hours, had trained her to the philosophic\nacceptance of surprises; but since Boyne’s withdrawal from business he\nhad adopted a Benedictine regularity of life. As if to make up for the\ndispersed and agitated years, with their “stand-up” lunches and dinners\nrattled down to the joltings of the dining-car, he cultivated the last\nrefinements of punctuality and monotony, discouraging his wife’s fancy\nfor the unexpected; and declaring that to a delicate taste there were\ninfinite gradations of pleasure in the fixed recurrences of habit.\n\nStill, since no life can completely defend itself from the unforeseen,\nit was evident that all Boyne’s precautions would sooner or later prove\nunavailable, and Mary concluded that he had cut short a tiresome visit\nby walking with his caller to the station, or at least accompanying him\nfor part of the way.\n\nThis conclusion relieved her from farther preoccupation, and she went\nout herself to take up her conference with the gardener. Thence she\nwalked to the village post-office, a mile or so away; and when she\nturned toward home, the early twilight was setting in.\n\nShe had taken a foot-path across the downs, and as Boyne, meanwhile,\nhad probably returned from the station by the highroad, there was little\nlikelihood of their meeting on the way. She felt sure, however, of his\nhaving reached the house before her; so sure that, when she entered it\nherself, without even pausing to inquire of Trimmle, she made directly\nfor the library. But the library was still empty, and with an unwonted\nprecision of visual memory she immediately observed that the papers on\nher husband’s desk lay precisely as they had lain when she had gone in\nto call him to luncheon.\n\nThen of a sudden she was seized by a vague dread of the unknown. She had\nclosed the door behind her on entering, and as she stood alone in the\nlong, silent, shadowy room, her dread seemed to take shape and sound,\nto be there audibly breathing and lurking among the shadows. Her\nshort-sighted eyes strained through them, half-discerning an actual\npresence, something aloof, that watched and knew; and in the recoil from\nthat intangible propinquity she threw herself suddenly on the bell-rope\nand gave it a desperate pull.\n\nThe long, quavering summons brought Trimmle in precipitately with a\nlamp, and Mary breathed again at this sobering reappearance of the\nusual.\n\n“You may bring tea if Mr. Boyne is in,” she said, to justify her ring.\n\n“Very well, Madam. But Mr. Boyne is not in,” said Trimmle, putting down\nthe lamp.\n\n“Not in? You mean he’s come back and gone out again?”\n\n“No, Madam. He’s never been back.”\n\nThe dread stirred again, and Mary knew that now it had her fast.\n\n“Not since he went out with--the gentleman?”\n\n“Not since he went out with the gentleman.”\n\n“But who WAS the gentleman?” Mary gasped out, with the sharp note of\nsome one trying to be heard through a confusion of meaningless noises.\n\n“That I couldn’t say, Madam.” Trimmle, standing there by the lamp,\nseemed suddenly to grow less round and rosy, as though eclipsed by the\nsame creeping shade of apprehension.\n\n“But the kitchen-maid knows--wasn’t it the kitchen-maid who let him in?”\n\n“She doesn’t know either, Madam, for he wrote his name on a folded\npaper.”\n\nMary, through her agitation, was aware that they were both designating\nthe unknown visitor by a vague pronoun, instead of the conventional\nformula which, till then, had kept their allusions within the bounds of\ncustom. And at the same moment her mind caught at the suggestion of the\nfolded paper.\n\n“But he must have a name! Where is the paper?”\n\nShe moved to the desk, and began to turn over the scattered documents\nthat littered it. The first that caught her eye was an unfinished letter\nin her husband’s hand, with his pen lying across it, as though dropped\nthere at a sudden summons.\n\n“My dear Parvis,”--who was Parvis?--“I have just received your letter\nannouncing Elwell’s death, and while I suppose there is now no farther\nrisk of trouble, it might be safer--”\n\nShe tossed the sheet aside, and continued her search; but no folded\npaper was discoverable among the letters and pages of manuscript which\nhad been swept together in a promiscuous heap, as if by a hurried or a\nstartled gesture.\n\n“But the kitchen-maid SAW him. Send her here,” she commanded, wondering\nat her dullness in not thinking sooner of so simple a solution.\n\nTrimmle, at the behest, vanished in a flash, as if thankful to be out\nof the room, and when she reappeared, conducting the agitated underling,\nMary had regained her self-possession, and had her questions pat.\n\nThe gentleman was a stranger, yes--that she understood. But what had he\nsaid? And, above all, what had he looked like? The first question was\neasily enough answered, for the disconcerting reason that he had said so\nlittle--had merely asked for Mr. Boyne, and, scribbling something on a\nbit of paper, had requested that it should at once be carried in to him.\n\n“Then you don’t know what he wrote? You’re not sure it WAS his name?”\n\nThe kitchen-maid was not sure, but supposed it was, since he had written\nit in answer to her inquiry as to whom she should announce.\n\n“And when you carried the paper in to Mr. Boyne, what did he say?”\n\nThe kitchen-maid did not think that Mr. Boyne had said anything, but she\ncould not be sure, for just as she had handed him the paper and he was\nopening it, she had become aware that the visitor had followed her\ninto the library, and she had slipped out, leaving the two gentlemen\ntogether.\n\n“But then, if you left them in the library, how do you know that they\nwent out of the house?”\n\nThis question plunged the witness into momentary inarticulateness,\nfrom which she was rescued by Trimmle, who, by means of ingenious\ncircumlocutions, elicited the statement that before she could cross the\nhall to the back passage she had heard the gentlemen behind her, and had\nseen them go out of the front door together.\n\n“Then, if you saw the gentleman twice, you must be able to tell me what\nhe looked like.”\n\nBut with this final challenge to her powers of expression it became\nclear that the limit of the kitchen-maid’s endurance had been reached.\nThe obligation of going to the front door to “show in” a visitor was\nin itself so subversive of the fundamental order of things that it had\nthrown her faculties into hopeless disarray, and she could only stammer\nout, after various panting efforts at evocation, “His hat, mum, was\ndifferent-like, as you might say--”\n\n“Different? How different?” Mary flashed out at her, her own mind, in\nthe same instant, leaping back to an image left on it that morning, but\ntemporarily lost under layers of subsequent impressions.\n\n“His hat had a wide brim, you mean? and his face was pale--a youngish\nface?” Mary pressed her, with a white-lipped intensity of interrogation.\nBut if the kitchen-maid found any adequate answer to this challenge,\nit was swept away for her listener down the rushing current of her own\nconvictions. The stranger--the stranger in the garden! Why had Mary not\nthought of him before? She needed no one now to tell her that it was he\nwho had called for her husband and gone away with him. But who was he,\nand why had Boyne obeyed his call?\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nIt leaped out at her suddenly, like a grin out of the dark, that they\nhad often called England so little--“such a confoundedly hard place to\nget lost in.”\n\nA CONFOUNDEDLY HARD PLACE TO GET LOST IN! That had been her husband’s\nphrase. And now, with the whole machinery of official investigation\nsweeping its flash-lights from shore to shore, and across the dividing\nstraits; now, with Boyne’s name blazing from the walls of every town\nand village, his portrait (how that wrung her!) hawked up and down the\ncountry like the image of a hunted criminal; now the little compact,\npopulous island, so policed, surveyed, and administered, revealed itself\nas a Sphinx-like guardian of abysmal mysteries, staring back into his\nwife’s anguished eyes as if with the malicious joy of knowing something\nthey would never know!\n\nIn the fortnight since Boyne’s disappearance there had been no word of\nhim, no trace of his movements. Even the usual misleading reports that\nraise expectancy in tortured bosoms had been few and fleeting. No one\nbut the bewildered kitchen-maid had seen him leave the house, and no one\nelse had seen “the gentleman” who accompanied him. All inquiries in the\nneighborhood failed to elicit the memory of a stranger’s presence that\nday in the neighborhood of Lyng. And no one had met Edward Boyne, either\nalone or in company, in any of the neighboring villages, or on the road\nacross the downs, or at either of the local railway-stations. The sunny\nEnglish noon had swallowed him as completely as if he had gone out into\nCimmerian night.\n\nMary, while every external means of investigation was working at its\nhighest pressure, had ransacked her husband’s papers for any trace of\nantecedent complications, of entanglements or obligations unknown to\nher, that might throw a faint ray into the darkness. But if any such\nhad existed in the background of Boyne’s life, they had disappeared as\ncompletely as the slip of paper on which the visitor had written his\nname. There remained no possible thread of guidance except--if it were\nindeed an exception--the letter which Boyne had apparently been in the\nact of writing when he received his mysterious summons. That letter,\nread and reread by his wife, and submitted by her to the police, yielded\nlittle enough for conjecture to feed on.\n\n“I have just heard of Elwell’s death, and while I suppose there is now\nno farther risk of trouble, it might be safer--” That was all. The “risk\nof trouble” was easily explained by the newspaper clipping which had\napprised Mary of the suit brought against her husband by one of his\nassociates in the Blue Star enterprise. The only new information\nconveyed in the letter was the fact of its showing Boyne, when he wrote\nit, to be still apprehensive of the results of the suit, though he\nhad assured his wife that it had been withdrawn, and though the letter\nitself declared that the plaintiff was dead. It took several weeks\nof exhaustive cabling to fix the identity of the “Parvis” to whom the\nfragmentary communication was addressed, but even after these inquiries\nhad shown him to be a Waukesha lawyer, no new facts concerning the\nElwell suit were elicited. He appeared to have had no direct concern\nin it, but to have been conversant with the facts merely as an\nacquaintance, and possible intermediary; and he declared himself unable\nto divine with what object Boyne intended to seek his assistance.\n\nThis negative information, sole fruit of the first fortnight’s feverish\nsearch, was not increased by a jot during the slow weeks that followed.\nMary knew that the investigations were still being carried on, but she\nhad a vague sense of their gradually slackening, as the actual march of\ntime seemed to slacken. It was as though the days, flying horror-struck\nfrom the shrouded image of the one inscrutable day, gained assurance as\nthe distance lengthened, till at last they fell back into their normal\ngait. And so with the human imaginations at work on the dark event. No\ndoubt it occupied them still, but week by week and hour by hour it grew\nless absorbing, took up less space, was slowly but inevitably crowded\nout of the foreground of consciousness by the new problems perpetually\nbubbling up from the vaporous caldron of human experience.\n\nEven Mary Boyne’s consciousness gradually felt the same lowering of\nvelocity. It still swayed with the incessant oscillations of conjecture;\nbut they were slower, more rhythmical in their beat. There were moments\nof overwhelming lassitude when, like the victim of some poison which\nleaves the brain clear, but holds the body motionless, she saw herself\ndomesticated with the Horror, accepting its perpetual presence as one of\nthe fixed conditions of life.\n\nThese moments lengthened into hours and days, till she passed into a\nphase of stolid acquiescence. She watched the familiar routine of life\nwith the incurious eye of a savage on whom the meaningless processes of\ncivilization make but the faintest impression. She had come to regard\nherself as part of the routine, a spoke of the wheel, revolving with its\nmotion; she felt almost like the furniture of the room in which she sat,\nan insensate object to be dusted and pushed about with the chairs and\ntables. And this deepening apathy held her fast at Lyng, in spite of\nthe urgent entreaties of friends and the usual medical recommendation of\n“change.” Her friends supposed that her refusal to move was inspired by\nthe belief that her husband would one day return to the spot from which\nhe had vanished, and a beautiful legend grew up about this imaginary\nstate of waiting. But in reality she had no such belief: the depths of\nanguish inclosing her were no longer lighted by flashes of hope. She was\nsure that Boyne would never come back, that he had gone out of her sight\nas completely as if Death itself had waited that day on the threshold.\nShe had even renounced, one by one, the various theories as to his\ndisappearance which had been advanced by the press, the police, and her\nown agonized imagination. In sheer lassitude her mind turned from these\nalternatives of horror, and sank back into the blank fact that he was\ngone.\n\nNo, she would never know what had become of him--no one would ever know.\nBut the house KNEW; the library in which she spent her long, lonely\nevenings knew. For it was here that the last scene had been enacted,\nhere that the stranger had come, and spoken the word which had caused\nBoyne to rise and follow him. The floor she trod had felt his tread; the\nbooks on the shelves had seen his face; and there were moments when the\nintense consciousness of the old, dusky walls seemed about to break out\ninto some audible revelation of their secret. But the revelation\nnever came, and she knew it would never come. Lyng was not one of the\ngarrulous old houses that betray the secrets intrusted to them. Its\nvery legend proved that it had always been the mute accomplice, the\nincorruptible custodian of the mysteries it had surprised. And Mary\nBoyne, sitting face to face with its portentous silence, felt the\nfutility of seeking to break it by any human means.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n“I don’t say it WASN’T straight, yet don’t say it WAS straight. It was\nbusiness.”\n\nMary, at the words, lifted her head with a start, and looked intently at\nthe speaker.\n\nWhen, half an hour before, a card with “Mr. Parvis” on it had been\nbrought up to her, she had been immediately aware that the name had been\na part of her consciousness ever since she had read it at the head of\nBoyne’s unfinished letter. In the library she had found awaiting her a\nsmall neutral-tinted man with a bald head and gold eye-glasses, and it\nsent a strange tremor through her to know that this was the person to\nwhom her husband’s last known thought had been directed.\n\nParvis, civilly, but without vain preamble,--in the manner of a man who\nhas his watch in his hand,--had set forth the object of his visit.\nHe had “run over” to England on business, and finding himself in the\nneighborhood of Dorchester, had not wished to leave it without paying\nhis respects to Mrs. Boyne; without asking her, if the occasion offered,\nwhat she meant to do about Bob Elwell’s family.\n\nThe words touched the spring of some obscure dread in Mary’s bosom.\nDid her visitor, after all, know what Boyne had meant by his unfinished\nphrase? She asked for an elucidation of his question, and noticed at\nonce that he seemed surprised at her continued ignorance of the subject.\nWas it possible that she really knew as little as she said?\n\n“I know nothing--you must tell me,” she faltered out; and her visitor\nthereupon proceeded to unfold his story. It threw, even to her confused\nperceptions, and imperfectly initiated vision, a lurid glare on the\nwhole hazy episode of the Blue Star Mine. Her husband had made his money\nin that brilliant speculation at the cost of “getting ahead” of some one\nless alert to seize the chance; the victim of his ingenuity was young\nRobert Elwell, who had “put him on” to the Blue Star scheme.\n\nParvis, at Mary’s first startled cry, had thrown her a sobering glance\nthrough his impartial glasses.\n\n“Bob Elwell wasn’t smart enough, that’s all; if he had been, he might\nhave turned round and served Boyne the same way. It’s the kind of thing\nthat happens every day in business. I guess it’s what the scientists\ncall the survival of the fittest,” said Mr. Parvis, evidently pleased\nwith the aptness of his analogy.\n\nMary felt a physical shrinking from the next question she tried to\nframe; it was as though the words on her lips had a taste that nauseated\nher.\n\n“But then--you accuse my husband of doing something dishonorable?”\n\nMr. Parvis surveyed the question dispassionately. “Oh, no, I don’t.\nI don’t even say it wasn’t straight.” He glanced up and down the long\nlines of books, as if one of them might have supplied him with the\ndefinition he sought. “I don’t say it WASN’T straight, and yet I don’t\nsay it WAS straight. It was business.” After all, no definition in his\ncategory could be more comprehensive than that.\n\nMary sat staring at him with a look of terror. He seemed to her like the\nindifferent, implacable emissary of some dark, formless power.\n\n“But Mr. Elwell’s lawyers apparently did not take your view, since I\nsuppose the suit was withdrawn by their advice.”\n\n“Oh, yes, they knew he hadn’t a leg to stand on, technically. It was\nwhen they advised him to withdraw the suit that he got desperate. You\nsee, he’d borrowed most of the money he lost in the Blue Star, and he\nwas up a tree. That’s why he shot himself when they told him he had no\nshow.”\n\nThe horror was sweeping over Mary in great, deafening waves.\n\n“He shot himself? He killed himself because of THAT?”\n\n“Well, he didn’t kill himself, exactly. He dragged on two months before\nhe died.” Parvis emitted the statement as unemotionally as a gramophone\ngrinding out its “record.”\n\n“You mean that he tried to kill himself, and failed? And tried again?”\n\n“Oh, he didn’t have to try again,” said Parvis, grimly.\n\nThey sat opposite each other in silence, he swinging his eye-glass\nthoughtfully about his finger, she, motionless, her arms stretched along\nher knees in an attitude of rigid tension.\n\n“But if you knew all this,” she began at length, hardly able to force\nher voice above a whisper, “how is it that when I wrote you at the\ntime of my husband’s disappearance you said you didn’t understand his\nletter?”\n\nParvis received this without perceptible discomfiture. “Why, I didn’t\nunderstand it--strictly speaking. And it wasn’t the time to talk\nabout it, if I had. The Elwell business was settled when the suit was\nwithdrawn. Nothing I could have told you would have helped you to find\nyour husband.”\n\nMary continued to scrutinize him. “Then why are you telling me now?”\n\nStill Parvis did not hesitate. “Well, to begin with, I supposed you\nknew more than you appear to--I mean about the circumstances of Elwell’s\ndeath. And then people are talking of it now; the whole matter’s been\nraked up again. And I thought, if you didn’t know, you ought to.”\n\nShe remained silent, and he continued: “You see, it’s only come out\nlately what a bad state Elwell’s affairs were in. His wife’s a proud\nwoman, and she fought on as long as she could, going out to work, and\ntaking sewing at home, when she got too sick--something with the heart,\nI believe. But she had his bedridden mother to look after, and the\nchildren, and she broke down under it, and finally had to ask for help.\nThat attracted attention to the case, and the papers took it up, and a\nsubscription was started. Everybody out there liked Bob Elwell, and most\nof the prominent names in the place are down on the list, and people\nbegan to wonder why--”\n\nParvis broke off to fumble in an inner pocket. “Here,” he continued,\n“here’s an account of the whole thing from the ‘Sentinel’--a little\nsensational, of course. But I guess you’d better look it over.”\n\nHe held out a newspaper to Mary, who unfolded it slowly, remembering,\nas she did so, the evening when, in that same room, the perusal of\na clipping from the “Sentinel” had first shaken the depths of her\nsecurity.\n\nAs she opened the paper, her eyes, shrinking from the glaring\nhead-lines, “Widow of Boyne’s Victim Forced to Appeal for Aid,” ran down\nthe column of text to two portraits inserted in it. The first was\nher husband’s, taken from a photograph made the year they had come to\nEngland. It was the picture of him that she liked best, the one that\nstood on the writing-table up-stairs in her bedroom. As the eyes in the\nphotograph met hers, she felt it would be impossible to read what was\nsaid of him, and closed her lids with the sharpness of the pain.\n\n“I thought if you felt disposed to put your name down--” she heard\nParvis continue.\n\nShe opened her eyes with an effort, and they fell on the other portrait.\nIt was that of a youngish man, slightly built, in rough clothes, with\nfeatures somewhat blurred by the shadow of a projecting hat-brim. Where\nhad she seen that outline before? She stared at it confusedly, her heart\nhammering in her throat and ears. Then she gave a cry.\n\n“This is the man--the man who came for my husband!”\n\nShe heard Parvis start to his feet, and was dimly aware that she had\nslipped backward into the corner of the sofa, and that he was bending\nabove her in alarm. With an intense effort she straightened herself, and\nreached out for the paper, which she had dropped.\n\n“It’s the man! I should know him anywhere!” she cried in a voice that\nsounded in her own ears like a scream.\n\nParvis’s voice seemed to come to her from far off, down endless,\nfog-muffled windings.\n\n“Mrs. Boyne, you’re not very well. Shall I call somebody? Shall I get a\nglass of water?”\n\n“No, no, no!” She threw herself toward him, her hand frantically\nclenching the newspaper. “I tell you, it’s the man! I KNOW him! He spoke\nto me in the garden!”\n\nParvis took the journal from her, directing his glasses to the portrait.\n“It can’t be, Mrs. Boyne. It’s Robert Elwell.”\n\n“Robert Elwell?” Her white stare seemed to travel into space. “Then it\nwas Robert Elwell who came for him.”\n\n“Came for Boyne? The day he went away?” Parvis’s voice dropped as hers\nrose. He bent over, laying a fraternal hand on her, as if to coax her\ngently back into her seat. “Why, Elwell was dead! Don’t you remember?”\n\nMary sat with her eyes fixed on the picture, unconscious of what he was\nsaying.\n\n“Don’t you remember Boyne’s unfinished letter to me--the one you found\non his desk that day? It was written just after he’d heard of Elwell’s\ndeath.” She noticed an odd shake in Parvis’s unemotional voice. “Surely\nyou remember that!” he urged her.\n\nYes, she remembered: that was the profoundest horror of it. Elwell had\ndied the day before her husband’s disappearance; and this was Elwell’s\nportrait; and it was the portrait of the man who had spoken to her in\nthe garden. She lifted her head and looked slowly about the library. The\nlibrary could have borne witness that it was also the portrait of the\nman who had come in that day to call Boyne from his unfinished letter.\nThrough the misty surgings of her brain she heard the faint boom\nof half-forgotten words--words spoken by Alida Stair on the lawn at\nPangbourne before Boyne and his wife had ever seen the house at Lyng, or\nhad imagined that they might one day live there.\n\n“This was the man who spoke to me,” she repeated.\n\nShe looked again at Parvis. He was trying to conceal his disturbance\nunder what he imagined to be an expression of indulgent commiseration;\nbut the edges of his lips were blue. “He thinks me mad; but I’m not\nmad,” she reflected; and suddenly there flashed upon her a way of\njustifying her strange affirmation.\n\nShe sat quiet, controlling the quiver of her lips, and waiting till she\ncould trust her voice to keep its habitual level; then she said, looking\nstraight at Parvis: “Will you answer me one question, please? When was\nit that Robert Elwell tried to kill himself?”\n\n“When--when?” Parvis stammered.\n\n“Yes; the date. Please try to remember.”\n\nShe saw that he was growing still more afraid of her. “I have a reason,”\n she insisted gently.\n\n“Yes, yes. Only I can’t remember. About two months before, I should\nsay.”\n\n“I want the date,” she repeated.\n\nParvis picked up the newspaper. “We might see here,” he said, still\nhumoring her. He ran his eyes down the page. “Here it is. Last\nOctober--the--”\n\nShe caught the words from him. “The 20th, wasn’t it?” With a sharp look\nat her, he verified. “Yes, the 20th. Then you DID know?”\n\n“I know now.” Her white stare continued to travel past him. “Sunday, the\n20th--that was the day he came first.”\n\nParvis’s voice was almost inaudible. “Came HERE first?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You saw him twice, then?”\n\n“Yes, twice.” She breathed it at him with dilated eyes. “He came first\non the 20th of October. I remember the date because it was the day\nwe went up Meldon Steep for the first time.” She felt a faint gasp\nof inward laughter at the thought that but for that she might have\nforgotten.\n\nParvis continued to scrutinize her, as if trying to intercept her gaze.\n\n“We saw him from the roof,” she went on. “He came down the lime-avenue\ntoward the house. He was dressed just as he is in that picture. My\nhusband saw him first. He was frightened, and ran down ahead of me; but\nthere was no one there. He had vanished.”\n\n“Elwell had vanished?” Parvis faltered.\n\n“Yes.” Their two whispers seemed to grope for each other. “I couldn’t\nthink what had happened. I see now. He TRIED to come then; but he wasn’t\ndead enough--he couldn’t reach us. He had to wait for two months; and\nthen he came back again--and Ned went with him.”\n\nShe nodded at Parvis with the look of triumph of a child who has\nsuccessfully worked out a difficult puzzle. But suddenly she lifted her\nhands with a desperate gesture, pressing them to her bursting temples.\n\n“Oh, my God! I sent him to Ned--I told him where to go! I sent him to\nthis room!” she screamed out.\n\nShe felt the walls of the room rush toward her, like inward falling\nruins; and she heard Parvis, a long way off, as if through the ruins,\ncrying to her, and struggling to get at her. But she was numb to his\ntouch, she did not know what he was saying. Through the tumult she heard\nbut one clear note, the voice of Alida Stair, speaking on the lawn at\nPangbourne.\n\n“You won’t know till afterward,” it said. “You won’t know till long,\nlong afterward.”\n\n\nThe End of Afterward\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FULNESS OF LIFE\n\nDecember 1893\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nFor hours she had lain in a kind of gentle torpor, not unlike that sweet\nlassitude which masters one in the hush of a midsummer noon, when the\nheat seems to have silenced the very birds and insects, and, lying sunk\nin the tasselled meadow-grasses, one looks up through a level roofing\nof maple-leaves at the vast shadowless, and unsuggestive blue. Now and\nthen, at ever-lengthening intervals, a flash of pain darted through her,\nlike the ripple of sheet-lightning across such a midsummer sky; but it\nwas too transitory to shake her stupor, that calm, delicious, bottomless\nstupor into which she felt herself sinking more and more deeply, without\na disturbing impulse of resistance, an effort of reattachment to the\nvanishing edges of consciousness.\n\nThe resistance, the effort, had known their hour of violence; but\nnow they were at an end. Through her mind, long harried by grotesque\nvisions, fragmentary images of the life that she was leaving, tormenting\nlines of verse, obstinate presentments of pictures once beheld,\nindistinct impressions of rivers, towers, and cupolas, gathered in the\nlength of journeys half forgotten--through her mind there now only moved\na few primal sensations of colorless well-being; a vague satisfaction\nin the thought that she had swallowed her noxious last draught of\nmedicine... and that she should never again hear the creaking of her\nhusband’s boots--those horrible boots--and that no one would come to\nbother her about the next day’s dinner... or the butcher’s book....\n\nAt last even these dim sensations spent themselves in the thickening\nobscurity which enveloped her; a dusk now filled with pale geometric\nroses, circling softly, interminably before her, now darkened to a\nuniform blue-blackness, the hue of a summer night without stars. And\ninto this darkness she felt herself sinking, sinking, with the gentle\nsense of security of one upheld from beneath. Like a tepid tide it\nrose around her, gliding ever higher and higher, folding in its velvety\nembrace her relaxed and tired body, now submerging her breast and\nshoulders, now creeping gradually, with soft inexorableness, over her\nthroat to her chin, to her ears, to her mouth.... Ah, now it was rising\ntoo high; the impulse to struggle was renewed;... her mouth was full;...\nshe was choking.... Help!\n\n“It is all over,” said the nurse, drawing down the eyelids with official\ncomposure.\n\nThe clock struck three. They remembered it afterward. Someone opened the\nwindow and let in a blast of that strange, neutral air which walks\nthe earth between darkness and dawn; someone else led the husband into\nanother room. He walked vaguely, like a blind man, on his creaking\nboots.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nShe stood, as it seemed, on a threshold, yet no tangible gateway was in\nfront of her. Only a wide vista of light, mild yet penetrating as the\ngathered glimmer of innumerable stars, expanded gradually before her\neyes, in blissful contrast to the cavernous darkness from which she had\nof late emerged.\n\nShe stepped forward, not frightened, but hesitating, and as her eyes\nbegan to grow more familiar with the melting depths of light about her,\nshe distinguished the outlines of a landscape, at first swimming in\nthe opaline uncertainty of Shelley’s vaporous creations, then gradually\nresolved into distincter shape--the vast unrolling of a sunlit plain,\naerial forms of mountains, and presently the silver crescent of a\nriver in the valley, and a blue stencilling of trees along its\ncurve--something suggestive in its ineffable hue of an azure background\nof Leonardo’s, strange, enchanting, mysterious, leading on the eye and\nthe imagination into regions of fabulous delight. As she gazed, her\nheart beat with a soft and rapturous surprise; so exquisite a promise\nshe read in the summons of that hyaline distance.\n\n“And so death is not the end after all,” in sheer gladness she heard\nherself exclaiming aloud. “I always knew that it couldn’t be. I believed\nin Darwin, of course. I do still; but then Darwin himself said that he\nwasn’t sure about the soul--at least, I think he did--and Wallace was a\nspiritualist; and then there was St. George Mivart--”\n\nHer gaze lost itself in the ethereal remoteness of the mountains.\n\n“How beautiful! How satisfying!” she murmured. “Perhaps now I shall\nreally know what it is to live.”\n\nAs she spoke she felt a sudden thickening of her heart-beats, and\nlooking up she was aware that before her stood the Spirit of Life.\n\n“Have you never really known what it is to live?” the Spirit of Life\nasked her.\n\n“I have never known,” she replied, “that fulness of life which we all\nfeel ourselves capable of knowing; though my life has not been without\nscattered hints of it, like the scent of earth which comes to one\nsometimes far out at sea.”\n\n“And what do you call the fulness of life?” the Spirit asked again.\n\n“Oh, I can’t tell you, if you don’t know,” she said, almost\nreproachfully. “Many words are supposed to define it--love and sympathy\nare those in commonest use, but I am not even sure that they are the\nright ones, and so few people really know what they mean.”\n\n“You were married,” said the Spirit, “yet you did not find the fulness\nof life in your marriage?”\n\n“Oh, dear, no,” she replied, with an indulgent scorn, “my marriage was a\nvery incomplete affair.”\n\n“And yet you were fond of your husband?”\n\n“You have hit upon the exact word; I was fond of him, yes, just as I\nwas fond of my grandmother, and the house that I was born in, and my old\nnurse. Oh, I was fond of him, and we were counted a very happy couple.\nBut I have sometimes thought that a woman’s nature is like a great house\nfull of rooms: there is the hall, through which everyone passes in going\nin and out; the drawing-room, where one receives formal visits; the\nsitting-room, where the members of the family come and go as they list;\nbut beyond that, far beyond, are other rooms, the handles of whose doors\nperhaps are never turned; no one knows the way to them, no one knows\nwhither they lead; and in the innermost room, the holy of holies, the\nsoul sits alone and waits for a footstep that never comes.”\n\n“And your husband,” asked the Spirit, after a pause, “never got beyond\nthe family sitting-room?”\n\n“Never,” she returned, impatiently; “and the worst of it was that he was\nquite content to remain there. He thought it perfectly beautiful, and\nsometimes, when he was admiring its commonplace furniture, insignificant\nas the chairs and tables of a hotel parlor, I felt like crying out to\nhim: ‘Fool, will you never guess that close at hand are rooms full of\ntreasures and wonders, such as the eye of man hath not seen, rooms that\nno step has crossed, but that might be yours to live in, could you but\nfind the handle of the door?’”\n\n“Then,” the Spirit continued, “those moments of which you lately spoke,\nwhich seemed to come to you like scattered hints of the fulness of life,\nwere not shared with your husband?”\n\n“Oh, no--never. He was different. His boots creaked, and he always\nslammed the door when he went out, and he never read anything but\nrailway novels and the sporting advertisements in the papers--and--and,\nin short, we never understood each other in the least.”\n\n“To what influence, then, did you owe those exquisite sensations?”\n\n“I can hardly tell. Sometimes to the perfume of a flower; sometimes to a\nverse of Dante or of Shakespeare; sometimes to a picture or a sunset,\nor to one of those calm days at sea, when one seems to be lying in\nthe hollow of a blue pearl; sometimes, but rarely, to a word spoken by\nsomeone who chanced to give utterance, at the right moment, to what I\nfelt but could not express.”\n\n“Someone whom you loved?” asked the Spirit.\n\n“I never loved anyone, in that way,” she said, rather sadly, “nor was\nI thinking of any one person when I spoke, but of two or three who, by\ntouching for an instant upon a certain chord of my being, had called\nforth a single note of that strange melody which seemed sleeping in my\nsoul. It has seldom happened, however, that I have owed such feelings to\npeople; and no one ever gave me a moment of such happiness as it was my\nlot to feel one evening in the Church of Or San Michele, in Florence.”\n\n“Tell me about it,” said the Spirit.\n\n“It was near sunset on a rainy spring afternoon in Easter week. The\nclouds had vanished, dispersed by a sudden wind, and as we entered the\nchurch the fiery panes of the high windows shone out like lamps through\nthe dusk. A priest was at the high altar, his white cope a livid spot in\nthe incense-laden obscurity, the light of the candles flickering up and\ndown like fireflies about his head; a few people knelt near by. We stole\nbehind them and sat down on a bench close to the tabernacle of Orcagna.\n\n“Strange to say, though Florence was not new to me, I had never been in\nthe church before; and in that magical light I saw for the first time\nthe inlaid steps, the fluted columns, the sculptured bas-reliefs and\ncanopy of the marvellous shrine. The marble, worn and mellowed by the\nsubtle hand of time, took on an unspeakable rosy hue, suggestive in\nsome remote way of the honey-colored columns of the Parthenon, but more\nmystic, more complex, a color not born of the sun’s inveterate kiss,\nbut made up of cryptal twilight, and the flame of candles upon martyrs’\ntombs, and gleams of sunset through symbolic panes of chrysoprase and\nruby; such a light as illumines the missals in the library of Siena,\nor burns like a hidden fire through the Madonna of Gian Bellini in the\nChurch of the Redeemer, at Venice; the light of the Middle Ages, richer,\nmore solemn, more significant than the limpid sunshine of Greece.\n\n“The church was silent, but for the wail of the priest and the\noccasional scraping of a chair against the floor, and as I sat there,\nbathed in that light, absorbed in rapt contemplation of the marble\nmiracle which rose before me, cunningly wrought as a casket of ivory and\nenriched with jewel-like incrustations and tarnished gleams of gold, I\nfelt myself borne onward along a mighty current, whose source seemed to\nbe in the very beginning of things, and whose tremendous waters gathered\nas they went all the mingled streams of human passion and endeavor.\nLife in all its varied manifestations of beauty and strangeness seemed\nweaving a rhythmical dance around me as I moved, and wherever the spirit\nof man had passed I knew that my foot had once been familiar.\n\n“As I gazed the mediaeval bosses of the tabernacle of Orcagna seemed to\nmelt and flow into their primal forms so that the folded lotus of\nthe Nile and the Greek acanthus were braided with the runic knots and\nfish-tailed monsters of the North, and all the plastic terror and beauty\nborn of man’s hand from the Ganges to the Baltic quivered and mingled\nin Orcagna’s apotheosis of Mary. And so the river bore me on, past the\nalien face of antique civilizations and the familiar wonders of Greece,\ntill I swam upon the fiercely rushing tide of the Middle Ages, with its\nswirling eddies of passion, its heaven-reflecting pools of poetry\nand art; I heard the rhythmic blow of the craftsmen’s hammers in the\ngoldsmiths’ workshops and on the walls of churches, the party-cries of\narmed factions in the narrow streets, the organ-roll of Dante’s verse,\nthe crackle of the fagots around Arnold of Brescia, the twitter of\nthe swallows to which St. Francis preached, the laughter of the\nladies listening on the hillside to the quips of the Decameron, while\nplague-struck Florence howled beneath them--all this and much more I\nheard, joined in strange unison with voices earlier and more remote,\nfierce, passionate, or tender, yet subdued to such awful harmony that\nI thought of the song that the morning stars sang together and felt as\nthough it were sounding in my ears. My heart beat to suffocation, the\ntears burned my lids, the joy, the mystery of it seemed too intolerable\nto be borne. I could not understand even then the words of the song; but\nI knew that if there had been someone at my side who could have heard it\nwith me, we might have found the key to it together.\n\n“I turned to my husband, who was sitting beside me in an attitude of\npatient dejection, gazing into the bottom of his hat; but at that moment\nhe rose, and stretching his stiffened legs, said, mildly: ‘Hadn’t we\nbetter be going? There doesn’t seem to be much to see here, and you know\nthe table d’hote dinner is at half-past six o’clock.”\n\n\nHer recital ended, there was an interval of silence; then the Spirit of\nLife said: “There is a compensation in store for such needs as you have\nexpressed.”\n\n“Oh, then you DO understand?” she exclaimed. “Tell me what compensation,\nI entreat you!”\n\n“It is ordained,” the Spirit answered, “that every soul which seeks\nin vain on earth for a kindred soul to whom it can lay bare its inmost\nbeing shall find that soul here and be united to it for eternity.”\n\nA glad cry broke from her lips. “Ah, shall I find him at last?” she\ncried, exultant.\n\n“He is here,” said the Spirit of Life.\n\nShe looked up and saw that a man stood near whose soul (for in that\nunwonted light she seemed to see his soul more clearly than his face)\ndrew her toward him with an invincible force.\n\n“Are you really he?” she murmured.\n\n“I am he,” he answered.\n\nShe laid her hand in his and drew him toward the parapet which overhung\nthe valley.\n\n“Shall we go down together,” she asked him, “into that marvellous\ncountry; shall we see it together, as if with the self-same eyes, and\ntell each other in the same words all that we think and feel?”\n\n“So,” he replied, “have I hoped and dreamed.”\n\n“What?” she asked, with rising joy. “Then you, too, have looked for me?”\n\n“All my life.”\n\n“How wonderful! And did you never, never find anyone in the other world\nwho understood you?”\n\n“Not wholly--not as you and I understand each other.”\n\n“Then you feel it, too? Oh, I am happy,” she sighed.\n\nThey stood, hand in hand, looking down over the parapet upon the\nshimmering landscape which stretched forth beneath them into sapphirine\nspace, and the Spirit of Life, who kept watch near the threshold, heard\nnow and then a floating fragment of their talk blown backward like the\nstray swallows which the wind sometimes separates from their migratory\ntribe.\n\n“Did you never feel at sunset--”\n\n“Ah, yes; but I never heard anyone else say so. Did you?”\n\n“Do you remember that line in the third canto of the ‘Inferno?’”\n\n“Ah, that line--my favorite always. Is it possible--”\n\n“You know the stooping Victory in the frieze of the Nike Apteros?”\n\n“You mean the one who is tying her sandal? Then you have noticed, too,\nthat all Botticelli and Mantegna are dormant in those flying folds of\nher drapery?”\n\n“After a storm in autumn have you never seen--”\n\n“Yes, it is curious how certain flowers suggest certain painters--the\nperfume of the incarnation, Leonardo; that of the rose, Titian; the\ntuberose, Crivelli--”\n\n“I never supposed that anyone else had noticed it.”\n\n“Have you never thought--”\n\n“Oh, yes, often and often; but I never dreamed that anyone else had.”\n\n“But surely you must have felt--”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes; and you, too--”\n\n“How beautiful! How strange--”\n\nTheir voices rose and fell, like the murmur of two fountains answering\neach other across a garden full of flowers. At length, with a certain\ntender impatience, he turned to her and said: “Love, why should we\nlinger here? All eternity lies before us. Let us go down into that\nbeautiful country together and make a home for ourselves on some blue\nhill above the shining river.”\n\nAs he spoke, the hand she had forgotten in his was suddenly withdrawn,\nand he felt that a cloud was passing over the radiance of her soul.\n\n“A home,” she repeated, slowly, “a home for you and me to live in for\nall eternity?”\n\n“Why not, love? Am I not the soul that yours has sought?”\n\n“Y-yes--yes, I know--but, don’t you see, home would not be like home to\nme, unless--”\n\n“Unless?” he wonderingly repeated.\n\nShe did not answer, but she thought to herself, with an impulse of\nwhimsical inconsistency, “Unless you slammed the door and wore creaking\nboots.”\n\nBut he had recovered his hold upon her hand, and by imperceptible\ndegrees was leading her toward the shining steps which descended to the\nvalley.\n\n“Come, O my soul’s soul,” he passionately implored; “why delay a moment?\nSurely you feel, as I do, that eternity itself is too short to hold such\nbliss as ours. It seems to me that I can see our home already. Have\nI not always seem it in my dreams? It is white, love, is it not, with\npolished columns, and a sculptured cornice against the blue? Groves\nof laurel and oleander and thickets of roses surround it; but from the\nterrace where we walk at sunset, the eye looks out over woodlands and\ncool meadows where, deep-bowered under ancient boughs, a stream goes\ndelicately toward the river. Indoors our favorite pictures hang upon the\nwalls and the rooms are lined with books. Think, dear, at last we shall\nhave time to read them all. With which shall we begin? Come, help me to\nchoose. Shall it be ‘Faust’ or the ‘Vita Nuova,’ the ‘Tempest’ or ‘Les\nCaprices de Marianne,’ or the thirty-first canto of the ‘Paradise,’ or\n‘Epipsychidion’ or ‘Lycidas’? Tell me, dear, which one?”\n\nAs he spoke he saw the answer trembling joyously upon her lips; but it\ndied in the ensuing silence, and she stood motionless, resisting the\npersuasion of his hand.\n\n“What is it?” he entreated.\n\n“Wait a moment,” she said, with a strange hesitation in her voice. “Tell\nme first, are you quite sure of yourself? Is there no one on earth whom\nyou sometimes remember?”\n\n“Not since I have seen you,” he replied; for, being a man, he had indeed\nforgotten.\n\nStill she stood motionless, and he saw that the shadow deepened on her\nsoul.\n\n“Surely, love,” he rebuked her, “it was not that which troubled you? For\nmy part I have walked through Lethe. The past has melted like a cloud\nbefore the moon. I never lived until I saw you.”\n\nShe made no answer to his pleadings, but at length, rousing herself with\na visible effort, she turned away from him and moved toward the Spirit\nof Life, who still stood near the threshold.\n\n“I want to ask you a question,” she said, in a troubled voice.\n\n“Ask,” said the Spirit.\n\n“A little while ago,” she began, slowly, “you told me that every soul\nwhich has not found a kindred soul on earth is destined to find one\nhere.”\n\n“And have you not found one?” asked the Spirit.\n\n“Yes; but will it be so with my husband’s soul also?”\n\n“No,” answered the Spirit of Life, “for your husband imagined that\nhe had found his soul’s mate on earth in you; and for such delusions\neternity itself contains no cure.”\n\nShe gave a little cry. Was it of disappointment or triumph?\n\n“Then--then what will happen to him when he comes here?”\n\n“That I cannot tell you. Some field of activity and happiness he will\ndoubtless find, in due measure to his capacity for being active and\nhappy.”\n\nShe interrupted, almost angrily: “He will never be happy without me.”\n\n“Do not be too sure of that,” said the Spirit.\n\nShe took no notice of this, and the Spirit continued: “He will not\nunderstand you here any better than he did on earth.”\n\n“No matter,” she said; “I shall be the only sufferer, for he always\nthought that he understood me.”\n\n“His boots will creak just as much as ever--”\n\n“No matter.”\n\n“And he will slam the door--”\n\n“Very likely.”\n\n“And continue to read railway novels--”\n\nShe interposed, impatiently: “Many men do worse than that.”\n\n“But you said just now,” said the Spirit, “that you did not love him.”\n\n“True,” she answered, simply; “but don’t you understand that I shouldn’t\nfeel at home without him? It is all very well for a week or two--but for\neternity! After all, I never minded the creaking of his boots, except\nwhen my head ached, and I don’t suppose it will ache HERE; and he\nwas always so sorry when he had slammed the door, only he never COULD\nremember not to. Besides, no one else would know how to look after him,\nhe is so helpless. His inkstand would never be filled, and he would\nalways be out of stamps and visiting-cards. He would never remember to\nhave his umbrella re-covered, or to ask the price of anything before he\nbought it. Why, he wouldn’t even know what novels to read. I always had\nto choose the kind he liked, with a murder or a forgery and a successful\ndetective.”\n\nShe turned abruptly to her kindred soul, who stood listening with a mien\nof wonder and dismay.\n\n“Don’t you see,” she said, “that I can’t possibly go with you?”\n\n“But what do you intend to do?” asked the Spirit of Life.\n\n“What do I intend to do?” she returned, indignantly. “Why, I mean to\nwait for my husband, of course. If he had come here first HE would have\nwaited for me for years and years; and it would break his heart not to\nfind me here when he comes.” She pointed with a contemptuous gesture\nto the magic vision of hill and vale sloping away to the translucent\nmountains. “He wouldn’t give a fig for all that,” she said, “if he\ndidn’t find me here.”\n\n“But consider,” warned the Spirit, “that you are now choosing for\neternity. It is a solemn moment.”\n\n“Choosing!” she said, with a half-sad smile. “Do you still keep up here\nthat old fiction about choosing? I should have thought that YOU knew\nbetter than that. How can I help myself? He will expect to find me here\nwhen he comes, and he would never believe you if you told him that I had\ngone away with someone else--never, never.”\n\n“So be it,” said the Spirit. “Here, as on earth, each one must decide\nfor himself.”\n\nShe turned to her kindred soul and looked at him gently, almost\nwistfully. “I am sorry,” she said. “I should have liked to talk with\nyou again; but you will understand, I know, and I dare say you will find\nsomeone else a great deal cleverer--”\n\nAnd without pausing to hear his answer she waved him a swift farewell\nand turned back toward the threshold.\n\n“Will my husband come soon?” she asked the Spirit of Life.\n\n“That you are not destined to know,” the Spirit replied.\n\n“No matter,” she said, cheerfully; “I have all eternity to wait in.”\n\nAnd still seated alone on the threshold, she listens for the creaking of\nhis boots.\n\n\nThe End of The Fulness of Life\n\n\n\n\n\nA VENETIAN NIGHT’S ENTERTAINMENT\n\nDecember 1903\n\n\n\nThis is the story that, in the dining-room of the old Beacon Street\nhouse (now the Aldebaran Club), Judge Anthony Bracknell, of the famous\nEast India firm of Bracknell & Saulsbee, when the ladies had withdrawn\nto the oval parlour (and Maria’s harp was throwing its gauzy web of\nsound across the Common), used to relate to his grandsons, about the\nyear that Buonaparte marched upon Moscow.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n“Him Venice!” said the Lascar with the big earrings; and Tony Bracknell,\nleaning on the high gunwale of his father’s East Indiaman, the Hepzibah\nB., saw far off, across the morning sea, a faint vision of towers and\ndomes dissolved in golden air.\n\nIt was a rare February day of the year 1760, and a young Tony, newly\nof age, and bound on the grand tour aboard the crack merchantman of old\nBracknell’s fleet, felt his heart leap up as the distant city trembled\ninto shape. VENICE! The name, since childhood, had been a magician’s\nwand to him. In the hall of the old Bracknell house at Salem there hung\na series of yellowing prints which Uncle Richard Saulsbee had brought\nhome from one of his long voyages: views of heathen mosques and palaces,\nof the Grand Turk’s Seraglio, of St. Peter’s Church in Rome; and, in\na corner--the corner nearest the rack where the old flintlocks hung--a\nbusy merry populous scene, entitled: ST. MARK’S SQUARE IN VENICE. This\npicture, from the first, had singularly taken little Tony’s fancy. His\nunformulated criticism on the others was that they lacked action.\nTrue, in the view of St. Peter’s an experienced-looking gentleman in\na full-bottomed wig was pointing out the fairly obvious monument to a\nbashful companion, who had presumably not ventured to raise his eyes to\nit; while, at the doors of the Seraglio, a group of turbaned infidels\nobserved with less hesitancy the approach of a veiled lady on a camel.\nBut in Venice so many things were happening at once--more, Tony was\nsure, than had ever happened in Boston in a twelve-month or in Salem in\na long lifetime. For here, by their garb, were people of every nation\non earth, Chinamen, Turks, Spaniards, and many more, mixed with a\nparti-coloured throng of gentry, lacqueys, chapmen, hucksters, and tall\npersonages in parsons’ gowns who stalked through the crowd with an air\nof mastery, a string of parasites at their heels. And all these people\nseemed to be diverting themselves hugely, chaffering with the hucksters,\nwatching the antics of trained dogs and monkeys, distributing doles\nto maimed beggars or having their pockets picked by slippery-looking\nfellows in black--the whole with such an air of ease and good-humour\nthat one felt the cut-purses to be as much a part of the show as the\ntumbling acrobats and animals.\n\nAs Tony advanced in years and experience this childish mumming lost\nits magic; but not so the early imaginings it had excited. For the old\npicture had been but the spring-board of fancy, the first step of a\ncloud-ladder leading to a land of dreams. With these dreams the name\nof Venice remained associated; and all that observation or report\nsubsequently brought him concerning the place seemed, on a sober\nwarranty of fact, to confirm its claim to stand midway between\nreality and illusion. There was, for instance, a slender Venice glass,\ngold-powdered as with lily-pollen or the dust of sunbeams, that,\nstanding in the corner cabinet betwixt two Lowestoft caddies, seemed,\namong its lifeless neighbours, to palpitate like an impaled butterfly.\nThere was, farther, a gold chain of his mother’s, spun of that same\nsun-pollen, so thread-like, impalpable, that it slipped through the\nfingers like light, yet so strong that it carried a heavy pendant which\nseemed held in air as if by magic. MAGIC! That was the word which the\nthought of Venice evoked. It was the kind of place, Tony felt, in which\nthings elsewhere impossible might naturally happen, in which two and two\nmight make five, a paradox elope with a syllogism, and a conclusion give\nthe lie to its own premiss. Was there ever a young heart that did not,\nonce and again, long to get away into such a world as that? Tony, at\nleast, had felt the longing from the first hour when the axioms in\nhis horn-book had brought home to him his heavy responsibilities as a\nChristian and a sinner. And now here was his wish taking shape before\nhim, as the distant haze of gold shaped itself into towers and domes\nacross the morning sea!\n\nThe Reverend Ozias Mounce, Tony’s governor and bear-leader, was just\nputting a hand to the third clause of the fourth part of a sermon\non Free-Will and Predestination as the Hepzibah B.’s anchor rattled\noverboard. Tony, in his haste to be ashore, would have made one plunge\nwith the anchor; but the Reverend Ozias, on being roused from his\nlucubrations, earnestly protested against leaving his argument in\nsuspense. What was the trifle of an arrival at some Papistical\nforeign city, where the very churches wore turbans like so many\nMoslem idolators, to the important fact of Mr. Mounce’s summing up his\nconclusions before the Muse of Theology took flight? He should be happy,\nhe said, if the tide served, to visit Venice with Mr. Bracknell the next\nmorning.\n\nThe next morning, ha!--Tony murmured a submissive “Yes, sir,” winked at\nthe subjugated captain, buckled on his sword, pressed his hat down\nwith a flourish, and before the Reverend Ozias had arrived at his next\ndeduction, was skimming merrily shoreward in the Hepzibah’s gig.\n\nA moment more and he was in the thick of it! Here was the very world of\nthe old print, only suffused with sunlight and colour, and bubbling\nwith merry noises. What a scene it was! A square enclosed in fantastic\npainted buildings, and peopled with a throng as fantastic: a bawling,\nlaughing, jostling, sweating mob, parti-coloured, parti-speeched,\ncrackling and sputtering under the hot sun like a dish of fritters over\na kitchen fire. Tony, agape, shouldered his way through the press, aware\nat once that, spite of the tumult, the shrillness, the gesticulation,\nthere was no undercurrent of clownishness, no tendency to horse-play,\nas in such crowds on market-day at home, but a kind of facetious suavity\nwhich seemed to include everybody in the circumference of one huge joke.\nIn such an air the sense of strangeness soon wore off, and Tony was\nbeginning to feel himself vastly at home, when a lift of the tide bore\nhim against a droll-looking bell-ringing fellow who carried above his\nhead a tall metal tree hung with sherbet-glasses.\n\nThe encounter set the glasses spinning and three or four spun off and\nclattered to the stones. The sherbet-seller called on all the saints,\nand Tony, clapping a lordly hand to his pocket, tossed him a ducat by\nmistake for a sequin. The fellow’s eyes shot out of their orbits,\nand just then a personable-looking young man who had observed the\ntransaction stepped up to Tony and said pleasantly, in English:\n\n“I perceive, sir, that you are not familiar with our currency.”\n\n“Does he want more?” says Tony, very lordly; whereat the other laughed\nand replied: “You have given him enough to retire from his business and\nopen a gaming-house over the arcade.”\n\nTony joined in the laugh, and this incident bridging the preliminaries,\nthe two young men were presently hobnobbing over a glass of Canary in\nfront of one of the coffee-houses about the square. Tony counted\nhimself lucky to have run across an English-speaking companion who was\ngood-natured enough to give him a clue to the labyrinth; and when he had\npaid for the Canary (in the coin his friend selected) they set out\nagain to view the town. The Italian gentleman, who called himself Count\nRialto, appeared to have a very numerous acquaintance, and was able to\npoint out to Tony all the chief dignitaries of the state, the men of ton\nand ladies of fashion, as well as a number of other characters of a kind\nnot openly mentioned in taking a census of Salem.\n\nTony, who was not averse from reading when nothing better offered,\nhad perused the “Merchant of Venice” and Mr. Otway’s fine tragedy; but\nthough these pieces had given him a notion that the social usages of\nVenice differed from those at home, he was unprepared for the surprising\nappearance and manners of the great people his friend named to him. The\ngravest Senators of the Republic went in prodigious striped trousers,\nshort cloaks and feathered hats. One nobleman wore a ruff and doctor’s\ngown, another a black velvet tunic slashed with rose-colour; while the\nPresident of the dreaded Council of Ten was a terrible strutting fellow\nwith a rapier-like nose, a buff leather jerkin and a trailing scarlet\ncloak that the crowd was careful not to step on.\n\nIt was all vastly diverting, and Tony would gladly have gone on forever;\nbut he had given his word to the captain to be at the landing-place at\nsunset, and here was dusk already creeping over the skies! Tony was a\nman of honour; and having pressed on the Count a handsome damascened\ndagger selected from one of the goldsmiths’ shops in a narrow street\nlined with such wares, he insisted on turning his face toward the\nHepzibah’s gig. The Count yielded reluctantly; but as they came out\nagain on the square they were caught in a great throng pouring toward\nthe doors of the cathedral.\n\n“They go to Benediction,” said the Count. “A beautiful sight, with many\nlights and flowers. It is a pity you cannot take a peep at it.”\n\nTony thought so too, and in another minute a legless beggar had pulled\nback the leathern flap of the cathedral door, and they stood in a\nhaze of gold and perfume that seemed to rise and fall on the mighty\nundulations of the organ. Here the press was as thick as without; and as\nTony flattened himself against a pillar, he heard a pretty voice at his\nelbow:--“Oh, sir, oh, sir, your sword!”\n\nHe turned at sound of the broken English, and saw a girl who matched the\nvoice trying to disengage her dress from the tip of his scabbard.\nShe wore one of the voluminous black hoods which the Venetian ladies\naffected, and under its projecting eaves her face spied out at him as\nsweet as a nesting bird.\n\nIn the dusk their hands met over the scabbard, and as she freed herself\na shred of her lace flounce clung to Tony’s enchanted fingers. Looking\nafter her, he saw she was on the arm of a pompous-looking graybeard in\na long black gown and scarlet stockings, who, on perceiving the\nexchange of glances between the young people, drew the lady away with a\nthreatening look.\n\nThe Count met Tony’s eye with a smile. “One of our Venetian beauties,”\n said he; “the lovely Polixena Cador. She is thought to have the finest\neyes in Venice.”\n\n“She spoke English,” stammered Tony.\n\n“Oh--ah--precisely: she learned the language at the Court of Saint\nJames’s, where her father, the Senator, was formerly accredited as\nAmbassador. She played as an infant with the royal princes of England.”\n\n“And that was her father?”\n\n“Assuredly: young ladies of Donna Polixena’s rank do not go abroad save\nwith their parents or a duenna.”\n\nJust then a soft hand slid into Tony’s. His heart gave a foolish bound,\nand he turned about half-expecting to meet again the merry eyes under\nthe hood; but saw instead a slender brown boy, in some kind of fanciful\npage’s dress, who thrust a folded paper between his fingers and vanished\nin the throng. Tony, in a tingle, glanced surreptitiously at the Count,\nwho appeared absorbed in his prayers. The crowd, at the ringing of a\nbell, had in fact been overswept by a sudden wave of devotion; and Tony\nseized the moment to step beneath a lighted shrine with his letter.\n\n“I am in dreadful trouble and implore your help. Polixena”--he read;\nbut hardly had he seized the sense of the words when a hand fell on his\nshoulder, and a stern-looking man in a cocked hat, and bearing a kind of\nrod or mace, pronounced a few words in Venetian.\n\nTony, with a start, thrust the letter in his breast, and tried to jerk\nhimself free; but the harder he jerked the tighter grew the other’s\ngrip, and the Count, presently perceiving what had happened, pushed\nhis way through the crowd, and whispered hastily to his companion: “For\nGod’s sake, make no struggle. This is serious. Keep quiet and do as I\ntell you.”\n\nTony was no chicken-heart. He had something of a name for pugnacity\namong the lads of his own age at home, and was not the man to stand in\nVenice what he would have resented in Salem; but the devil of it was\nthat this black fellow seemed to be pointing to the letter in his\nbreast; and this suspicion was confirmed by the Count’s agitated\nwhisper.\n\n“This is one of the agents of the Ten.--For God’s sake, no outcry.” He\nexchanged a word or two with the mace-bearer and again turned to Tony.\n“You have been seen concealing a letter about your person--”\n\n“And what of that?” says Tony furiously.\n\n“Gently, gently, my master. A letter handed to you by the page of Donna\nPolixena Cador.--A black business! Oh, a very black business! This Cador\nis one of the most powerful nobles in Venice--I beseech you, not a word,\nsir! Let me think--deliberate--”\n\nHis hand on Tony’s shoulder, he carried on a rapid dialogue with the\npotentate in the cocked hat.\n\n“I am sorry, sir--but our young ladies of rank are as jealously guarded\nas the Grand Turk’s wives, and you must be answerable for this scandal.\nThe best I can do is to have you taken privately to the Palazzo Cador,\ninstead of being brought before the Council. I have pleaded your youth\nand inexperience”--Tony winced at this--“and I think the business may\nstill be arranged.”\n\nMeanwhile the agent of the Ten had yielded his place to a sharp-featured\nshabby-looking fellow in black, dressed somewhat like a lawyer’s clerk,\nwho laid a grimy hand on Tony’s arm, and with many apologetic gestures\nsteered him through the crowd to the doors of the church. The Count held\nhim by the other arm, and in this fashion they emerged on the square,\nwhich now lay in darkness save for the many lights twinkling under the\narcade and in the windows of the gaming-rooms above it.\n\nTony by this time had regained voice enough to declare that he would go\nwhere they pleased, but that he must first say a word to the mate of the\nHepzibah, who had now been awaiting him some two hours or more at the\nlanding-place.\n\nThe Count repeated this to Tony’s custodian, but the latter shook his\nhead and rattled off a sharp denial.\n\n“Impossible, sir,” said the Count. “I entreat you not to insist. Any\nresistance will tell against you in the end.”\n\nTony fell silent. With a rapid eye he was measuring his chances of\nescape. In wind and limb he was more than a mate for his captors, and\nboyhood’s ruses were not so far behind him but he felt himself equal to\noutwitting a dozen grown men; but he had the sense to see that at a cry\nthe crowd would close in on him. Space was what he wanted: a clear ten\nyards, and he would have laughed at Doge and Council. But the throng was\nthick as glue, and he walked on submissively, keeping his eye alert for\nan opening. Suddenly the mob swerved aside after some new show. Tony’s\nfist shot out at the black fellow’s chest, and before the latter could\nright himself the young New Englander was showing a clean pair of heels\nto his escort. On he sped, cleaving the crowd like a flood-tide in\nGloucester bay, diving under the first arch that caught his eye,\ndashing down a lane to an unlit water-way, and plunging across a narrow\nhump-back bridge which landed him in a black pocket between walls. But\nnow his pursuers were at his back, reinforced by the yelping mob. The\nwalls were too high to scale, and for all his courage Tony’s breath came\nshort as he paced the masonry cage in which ill-luck had landed him.\nSuddenly a gate opened in one of the walls, and a slip of a servant\nwench looked out and beckoned him. There was no time to weigh chances.\nTony dashed through the gate, his rescuer slammed and bolted it, and the\ntwo stood in a narrow paved well between high houses.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe servant picked up a lantern and signed to Tony to follow her. They\nclimbed a squalid stairway of stone, felt their way along a corridor,\nand entered a tall vaulted room feebly lit by an oil-lamp hung from\nthe painted ceiling. Tony discerned traces of former splendour in his\nsurroundings, but he had no time to examine them, for a figure started\nup at his approach and in the dim light he recognized the girl who was\nthe cause of all his troubles.\n\nShe sprang toward him with outstretched hands, but as he advanced her\nface changed and she shrank back abashed.\n\n“This is a misunderstanding--a dreadful misunderstanding,” she cried\nout in her pretty broken English. “Oh, how does it happen that you are\nhere?”\n\n“Through no choice of my own, madam, I assure you!” retorted Tony, not\nover-pleased by his reception.\n\n“But why--how--how did you make this unfortunate mistake?”\n\n“Why, madam, if you’ll excuse my candour, I think the mistake was\nyours--”\n\n“Mine?”\n\n--“in sending me a letter--”\n\n“YOU--a letter?”\n\n--“by a simpleton of a lad, who must needs hand it to me under your\nfather’s very nose--”\n\nThe girl broke in on him with a cry. “What! It was YOU who received my\nletter?” She swept round on the little maid-servant and submerged her\nunder a flood of Venetian. The latter volleyed back in the same jargon,\nand as she did so, Tony’s astonished eye detected in her the doubleted\npage who had handed him the letter in Saint Mark’s.\n\n“What!” he cried, “the lad was this girl in disguise?”\n\nPolixena broke off with an irrepressible smile; but her face clouded\ninstantly and she returned to the charge.\n\n“This wicked, careless girl--she has ruined me, she will be my undoing!\nOh, sir, how can I make you understand? The letter was not intended\nfor you--it was meant for the English Ambassador, an old friend of my\nmother’s, from whom I hoped to obtain assistance--oh, how can I ever\nexcuse myself to you?”\n\n“No excuses are needed, madam,” said Tony, bowing; “though I am\nsurprised, I own, that any one should mistake me for an ambassador.”\n\nHere a wave of mirth again overran Polixena’s face. “Oh, sir, you\nmust pardon my poor girl’s mistake. She heard you speaking English,\nand--and--I had told her to hand the letter to the handsomest foreigner\nin the church.” Tony bowed again, more profoundly. “The English\nAmbassador,” Polixena added simply, “is a very handsome man.”\n\n“I wish, madam, I were a better proxy!”\n\nShe echoed his laugh, and then clapped her hands together with a look\nof anguish. “Fool that I am! How can I jest at such a moment? I am in\ndreadful trouble, and now perhaps I have brought trouble on you also--\nOh, my father! I hear my father coming!” She turned pale and leaned\ntremblingly upon the little servant.\n\nFootsteps and loud voices were in fact heard outside, and a moment\nlater the red-stockinged Senator stalked into the room attended by\nhalf-a-dozen of the magnificoes whom Tony had seen abroad in the square.\nAt sight of him, all clapped hands to their swords and burst into\nfurious outcries; and though their jargon was unintelligible to the\nyoung man, their tones and gestures made their meaning unpleasantly\nplain. The Senator, with a start of anger, first flung himself on the\nintruder; then, snatched back by his companions, turned wrathfully on\nhis daughter, who, at his feet, with outstretched arms and streaming\nface, pleaded her cause with all the eloquence of young distress.\nMeanwhile the other nobles gesticulated vehemently among themselves,\nand one, a truculent-looking personage in ruff and Spanish cape, stalked\napart, keeping a jealous eye on Tony. The latter was at his wit’s\nend how to comport himself, for the lovely Polixena’s tears had\nquite drowned her few words of English, and beyond guessing that the\nmagnificoes meant him a mischief he had no notion what they would be at.\n\nAt this point, luckily, his friend Count Rialto suddenly broke in on\nthe scene, and was at once assailed by all the tongues in the room. He\npulled a long face at sight of Tony, but signed to the young man to be\nsilent, and addressed himself earnestly to the Senator. The latter, at\nfirst, would not draw breath to hear him; but presently, sobering,\nhe walked apart with the Count, and the two conversed together out of\nearshot.\n\n“My dear sir,” said the Count, at length turning to Tony with a\nperturbed countenance, “it is as I feared, and you are fallen into a\ngreat misfortune.”\n\n“A great misfortune! A great trap, I call it!” shouted Tony, whose\nblood, by this time, was boiling; but as he uttered the word the\nbeautiful Polixena cast such a stricken look on him that he blushed up\nto the forehead.\n\n“Be careful,” said the Count, in a low tone. “Though his Illustriousness\ndoes not speak your language, he understands a few words of it, and--”\n\n“So much the better!” broke in Tony; “I hope he will understand me if I\nask him in plain English what is his grievance against me.”\n\nThe Senator, at this, would have burst forth again; but the Count,\nstepping between, answered quickly: “His grievance against you is that\nyou have been detected in secret correspondence with his daughter, the\nmost noble Polixena Cador, the betrothed bride of this gentleman, the\nmost illustrious Marquess Zanipolo--” and he waved a deferential hand at\nthe frowning hidalgo of the cape and ruff.\n\n“Sir,” said Tony, “if that is the extent of my offence, it lies with\nthe young lady to set me free, since by her own avowal--” but here he\nstopped short, for, to his surprise, Polixena shot a terrified glance at\nhim.\n\n“Sir,” interposed the Count, “we are not accustomed in Venice to take\nshelter behind a lady’s reputation.”\n\n“No more are we in Salem,” retorted Tony in a white heat. “I was merely\nabout to remark that, by the young lady’s avowal, she has never seen me\nbefore.”\n\nPolixena’s eyes signalled her gratitude, and he felt he would have died\nto defend her.\n\nThe Count translated his statement, and presently pursued: “His\nIllustriousness observes that, in that case, his daughter’s misconduct\nhas been all the more reprehensible.”\n\n“Her misconduct? Of what does he accuse her?”\n\n“Of sending you, just now, in the church of Saint Mark’s, a letter which\nyou were seen to read openly and thrust in your bosom. The incident\nwas witnessed by his Illustriousness the Marquess Zanipolo, who, in\nconsequence, has already repudiated his unhappy bride.”\n\nTony stared contemptuously at the black Marquess. “If his\nIllustriousness is so lacking in gallantry as to repudiate a lady on so\ntrivial a pretext, it is he and not I who should be the object of her\nfather’s resentment.”\n\n“That, my dear young gentleman, is hardly for you to decide. Your only\nexcuse being your ignorance of our customs, it is scarcely for you to\nadvise us how to behave in matters of punctilio.”\n\nIt seemed to Tony as though the Count were going over to his enemies,\nand the thought sharpened his retort.\n\n“I had supposed,” said he, “that men of sense had much the same\nbehaviour in all countries, and that, here as elsewhere, a gentleman\nwould be taken at his word. I solemnly affirm that the letter I was seen\nto read reflects in no way on the honour of this young lady, and has in\nfact nothing to do with what you suppose.”\n\nAs he had himself no notion what the letter was about, this was as far\nas he dared commit himself.\n\nThere was another brief consultation in the opposing camp, and the\nCount then said:--“We all know, sir, that a gentleman is obliged to meet\ncertain enquiries by a denial; but you have at your command the means of\nimmediately clearing the lady. Will you show the letter to her father?”\n\nThere was a perceptible pause, during which Tony, while appearing to\nlook straight before him, managed to deflect an interrogatory glance\ntoward Polixena. Her reply was a faint negative motion, accompanied by\nunmistakable signs of apprehension.\n\n“Poor girl!” he thought, “she is in a worse case than I imagined, and\nwhatever happens I must keep her secret.”\n\nHe turned to the Senator with a deep bow. “I am not,” said he, “in the\nhabit of showing my private correspondence to strangers.”\n\nThe Count interpreted these words, and Donna Polixena’s father, dashing\nhis hand on his hilt, broke into furious invective, while the Marquess\ncontinued to nurse his outraged feelings aloof.\n\nThe Count shook his head funereally. “Alas, sir, it is as I feared.\nThis is not the first time that youth and propinquity have led to fatal\nimprudence. But I need hardly, I suppose, point out the obligation\nincumbent upon you as a man of honour.”\n\nTony stared at him haughtily, with a look which was meant for the\nMarquess. “And what obligation is that?”\n\n“To repair the wrong you have done--in other words, to marry the lady.”\n\nPolixena at this burst into tears, and Tony said to himself: “Why in\nheaven does she not bid me show the letter?” Then he remembered that it\nhad no superscription, and that the words it contained, supposing them\nto have been addressed to himself, were hardly of a nature to disarm\nsuspicion. The sense of the girl’s grave plight effaced all thought of\nhis own risk, but the Count’s last words struck him as so preposterous\nthat he could not repress a smile.\n\n“I cannot flatter myself,” said he, “that the lady would welcome this\nsolution.”\n\nThe Count’s manner became increasingly ceremonious. “Such modesty,”\n he said, “becomes your youth and inexperience; but even if it were\njustified it would scarcely alter the case, as it is always assumed in\nthis country that a young lady wishes to marry the man whom her father\nhas selected.”\n\n“But I understood just now,” Tony interposed, “that the gentleman yonder\nwas in that enviable position.”\n\n“So he was, till circumstances obliged him to waive the privilege in\nyour favour.”\n\n“He does me too much honour; but if a deep sense of my unworthiness\nobliges me to decline--”\n\n“You are still,” interrupted the Count, “labouring under a\nmisapprehension. Your choice in the matter is no more to be consulted\nthan the lady’s. Not to put too fine a point on it, it is necessary that\nyou should marry her within the hour.”\n\nTony, at this, for all his spirit, felt the blood run thin in his veins.\nHe looked in silence at the threatening visages between himself and the\ndoor, stole a side-glance at the high barred windows of the apartment,\nand then turned to Polixena, who had fallen sobbing at her father’s\nfeet.\n\n“And if I refuse?” said he.\n\nThe Count made a significant gesture. “I am not so foolish as to\nthreaten a man of your mettle. But perhaps you are unaware what the\nconsequences would be to the lady.”\n\nPolixena, at this, struggling to her feet, addressed a few impassioned\nwords to the Count and her father; but the latter put her aside with an\nobdurate gesture.\n\nThe Count turned to Tony. “The lady herself pleads for you--at what\ncost you do not guess--but as you see it is vain. In an hour his\nIllustriousness’s chaplain will be here. Meanwhile his Illustriousness\nconsents to leave you in the custody of your betrothed.”\n\nHe stepped back, and the other gentlemen, bowing with deep ceremony to\nTony, stalked out one by one from the room. Tony heard the key turn in\nthe lock, and found himself alone with Polixena.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe girl had sunk into a chair, her face hidden, a picture of shame\nand agony. So moving was the sight that Tony once again forgot his own\nextremity in the view of her distress. He went and kneeled beside her,\ndrawing her hands from her face.\n\n“Oh, don’t make me look at you!” she sobbed; but it was on his bosom\nthat she hid from his gaze. He held her there a breathing-space, as\nhe might have clasped a weeping child; then she drew back and put him\ngently from her.\n\n“What humiliation!” she lamented.\n\n“Do you think I blame you for what has happened?”\n\n“Alas, was it not my foolish letter that brought you to this plight? And\nhow nobly you defended me! How generous it was of you not to show the\nletter! If my father knew I had written to the Ambassador to save me\nfrom this dreadful marriage his anger against me would be even greater.”\n\n“Ah--it was that you wrote for?” cried Tony with unaccountable relief.\n\n“Of course--what else did you think?”\n\n“But is it too late for the Ambassador to save you?”\n\n“From YOU?” A smile flashed through her tears. “Alas, yes.” She drew\nback and hid her face again, as though overcome by a fresh wave of\nshame.\n\nTony glanced about him. “If I could wrench a bar out of that window--”\n he muttered.\n\n“Impossible! The court is guarded. You are a prisoner, alas.--Oh, I must\nspeak!” She sprang up and paced the room. “But indeed you can scarce\nthink worse of me than you do already--”\n\n“I think ill of you?”\n\n“Alas, you must! To be unwilling to marry the man my father has chosen\nfor me--”\n\n“Such a beetle-browed lout! It would be a burning shame if you married\nhim.”\n\n“Ah, you come from a free country. Here a girl is allowed no choice.”\n\n“It is infamous, I say--infamous!”\n\n“No, no--I ought to have resigned myself, like so many others.”\n\n“Resigned yourself to that brute! Impossible!”\n\n“He has a dreadful name for violence--his gondolier has told my little\nmaid such tales of him! But why do I talk of myself, when it is of you I\nshould be thinking?”\n\n“Of me, poor child?” cried Tony, losing his head.\n\n“Yes, and how to save you--for I CAN save you! But every moment\ncounts--and yet what I have to say is so dreadful.”\n\n“Nothing from your lips could seem dreadful.”\n\n“Ah, if he had had your way of speaking!”\n\n“Well, now at least you are free of him,” said Tony, a little wildly;\nbut at this she stood up and bent a grave look on him.\n\n“No, I am not free,” she said; “but you are, if you will do as I tell\nyou.”\n\nTony, at this, felt a sudden dizziness; as though, from a mad flight\nthrough clouds and darkness, he had dropped to safety again, and the\nfall had stunned him.\n\n“What am I to do?” he said.\n\n“Look away from me, or I can never tell you.”\n\nHe thought at first that this was a jest, but her eyes commanded him,\nand reluctantly he walked away and leaned in the embrasure of the\nwindow. She stood in the middle of the room, and as soon as his back\nwas turned she began to speak in a quick monotonous voice, as though she\nwere reciting a lesson.\n\n“You must know that the Marquess Zanipolo, though a great noble, is\nnot a rich man. True, he has large estates, but he is a desperate\nspendthrift and gambler, and would sell his soul for a round sum of\nready money.--If you turn round I shall not go on!--He wrangled horribly\nwith my father over my dowry--he wanted me to have more than either of\nmy sisters, though one married a Procurator and the other a grandee\nof Spain. But my father is a gambler too--oh, such fortunes as are\nsquandered over the arcade yonder! And so--and so--don’t turn, I implore\nyou--oh, do you begin to see my meaning?”\n\nShe broke off sobbing, and it took all his strength to keep his eyes\nfrom her.\n\n“Go on,” he said.\n\n“Will you not understand? Oh, I would say anything to save you! You\ndon’t know us Venetians--we’re all to be bought for a price. It is\nnot only the brides who are marketable--sometimes the husbands sell\nthemselves too. And they think you rich--my father does, and the\nothers--I don’t know why, unless you have shown your money too\nfreely--and the English are all rich, are they not? And--oh, oh--do you\nunderstand? Oh, I can’t bear your eyes!”\n\nShe dropped into a chair, her head on her arms, and Tony in a flash was\nat her side.\n\n“My poor child, my poor Polixena!” he cried, and wept and clasped her.\n\n“You ARE rich, are you not? You would promise them a ransom?” she\npersisted.\n\n“To enable you to marry the Marquess?”\n\n“To enable you to escape from this place. Oh, I hope I may never see\nyour face again.” She fell to weeping once more, and he drew away and\npaced the floor in a fever.\n\nPresently she sprang up with a fresh air of resolution, and pointed to a\nclock against the wall. “The hour is nearly over. It is quite true that\nmy father is gone to fetch his chaplain. Oh, I implore you, be warned by\nme! There is no other way of escape.”\n\n“And if I do as you say--?”\n\n“You are safe! You are free! I stake my life on it.”\n\n“And you--you are married to that villain?”\n\n“But I shall have saved you. Tell me your name, that I may say it to\nmyself when I am alone.”\n\n“My name is Anthony. But you must not marry that fellow.”\n\n“You forgive me, Anthony? You don’t think too badly of me?”\n\n“I say you must not marry that fellow.”\n\nShe laid a trembling hand on his arm. “Time presses,” she adjured him,\n“and I warn you there is no other way.”\n\nFor a moment he had a vision of his mother, sitting very upright, on a\nSunday evening, reading Dr. Tillotson’s sermons in the best parlour at\nSalem; then he swung round on the girl and caught both her hands in his.\n“Yes, there is,” he cried, “if you are willing. Polixena, let the priest\ncome!”\n\nShe shrank back from him, white and radiant. “Oh, hush, be silent!” she\nsaid.\n\n“I am no noble Marquess, and have no great estates,” he cried. “My\nfather is a plain India merchant in the colony of Massachusetts--but if\nyou--”\n\n“Oh, hush, I say! I don’t know what your long words mean. But I bless\nyou, bless you, bless you on my knees!” And she knelt before him, and\nfell to kissing his hands.\n\nHe drew her up to his breast and held her there.\n\n“You are willing, Polixena?” he said.\n\n“No, no!” She broke from him with outstretched hands. “I am not willing.\nYou mistake me. I must marry the Marquess, I tell you!”\n\n“On my money?” he taunted her; and her burning blush rebuked him.\n\n“Yes, on your money,” she said sadly.\n\n“Why? Because, much as you hate him, you hate me still more?”\n\nShe was silent.\n\n“If you hate me, why do you sacrifice yourself for me?” he persisted.\n\n“You torture me! And I tell you the hour is past.”\n\n“Let it pass. I’ll not accept your sacrifice. I will not lift a finger\nto help another man to marry you.”\n\n“Oh, madman, madman!” she murmured.\n\nTony, with crossed arms, faced her squarely, and she leaned against the\nwall a few feet off from him. Her breast throbbed under its lace and\nfalbalas, and her eyes swam with terror and entreaty.\n\n“Polixena, I love you!” he cried.\n\nA blush swept over her throat and bosom, bathing her in light to the\nverge of her troubled brows.\n\n“I love you! I love you!” he repeated.\n\nAnd now she was on his breast again, and all their youth was in their\nlips. But her embrace was as fleeting as a bird’s poise and before he\nknew it he clasped empty air, and half the room was between them.\n\nShe was holding up a little coral charm and laughing. “I took it from\nyour fob,” she said. “It is of no value, is it? And I shall not get any\nof the money, you know.”\n\nShe continued to laugh strangely, and the rouge burned like fire in her\nashen face.\n\n“What are you talking of?” he said.\n\n“They never give me anything but the clothes I wear. And I shall never\nsee you again, Anthony!” She gave him a dreadful look. “Oh, my poor boy,\nmy poor love--‘I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, POLIXENA!’”\n\nHe thought she had turned light-headed, and advanced to her with\nsoothing words; but she held him quietly at arm’s length, and as he\ngazed he read the truth in her face.\n\nHe fell back from her, and a sob broke from him as he bowed his head on\nhis hands.\n\n“Only, for God’s sake, have the money ready, or there may be foul play\nhere,” she said.\n\nAs she spoke there was a great tramping of steps outside and a burst of\nvoices on the threshold.\n\n“It is all a lie,” she gasped out, “about my marriage, and the Marquess,\nand the Ambassador, and the Senator--but not, oh, not about your danger\nin this place--or about my love,” she breathed to him. And as the key\nrattled in the door she laid her lips on his brow.\n\nThe key rattled, and the door swung open--but the black-cassocked\ngentleman who stepped in, though a priest indeed, was no votary of\nidolatrous rites, but that sound orthodox divine, the Reverend Ozias\nMounce, looking very much perturbed at his surroundings, and very much\non the alert for the Scarlet Woman. He was supported, to his evident\nrelief, by the captain of the Hepzibah B., and the procession was closed\nby an escort of stern-looking fellows in cocked hats and small-swords,\nwho led between them Tony’s late friends the magnificoes, now as sorry a\nlooking company as the law ever landed in her net.\n\nThe captain strode briskly into the room, uttering a grunt of\nsatisfaction as he clapped eyes on Tony.\n\n“So, Mr. Bracknell,” said he, “you have been seeing the Carnival with\nthis pack of mummers, have you? And this is where your pleasuring has\nlanded you? H’m--a pretty establishment, and a pretty lady at the head\nof it.” He glanced about the apartment and doffed his hat with mock\nceremony to Polixena, who faced him like a princess.\n\n“Why, my girl,” said he, amicably, “I think I saw you this morning in\nthe square, on the arm of the Pantaloon yonder; and as for that Captain\nSpavent--” and he pointed a derisive finger at the Marquess--“I’ve\nwatched him drive his bully’s trade under the arcade ever since I\nfirst dropped anchor in these waters. Well, well,” he continued, his\nindignation subsiding, “all’s fair in Carnival, I suppose, but this\ngentleman here is under sailing orders, and I fear we must break up your\nlittle party.”\n\nAt this Tony saw Count Rialto step forward, looking very small and\nexplanatory, and uncovering obsequiously to the captain.\n\n“I can assure you, sir,” said the Count in his best English, “that this\nincident is the result of an unfortunate misunderstanding, and if you\nwill oblige us by dismissing these myrmidons, any of my friends\nhere will be happy to offer satisfaction to Mr. Bracknell and his\ncompanions.”\n\nMr. Mounce shrank visibly at this, and the captain burst into a loud\nguffaw.\n\n“Satisfaction?” says he. “Why, my cock, that’s very handsome of you,\nconsidering the rope’s at your throats. But we’ll not take advantage of\nyour generosity, for I fear Mr. Bracknell has already trespassed on\nit too long. You pack of galley-slaves, you!” he spluttered suddenly,\n“decoying young innocents with that devil’s bait of yours--” His eye\nfell on Polixena, and his voice softened unaccountably. “Ah, well, we\nmust all see the Carnival once, I suppose,” he said. “All’s well that\nends well, as the fellow says in the play; and now, if you please, Mr.\nBracknell, if you’ll take the reverend gentleman’s arm there, we’ll\nbid adieu to our hospitable entertainers, and right about face for the\nHepzibah.”\n\n\nThe End of A Venetian Night’s Entertainment\n\n\n\n\n\nXINGU\n\nDecember, 1911\n\n\nMrs. Ballinger is one of the ladies who pursue Culture in bands, as\nthough it were dangerous to meet alone. To this end she had founded\nthe Lunch Club, an association composed of herself and several other\nindomitable huntresses of erudition. The Lunch Club, after three or four\nwinters of lunching and debate, had acquired such local distinction that\nthe entertainment of distinguished strangers became one of its accepted\nfunctions; in recognition of which it duly extended to the celebrated\n“Osric Dane,” on the day of her arrival in Hillbridge, an invitation to\nbe present at the next meeting.\n\nThe Club was to meet at Mrs. Ballinger’s. The other members, behind\nher back, were of one voice in deploring her unwillingness to cede\nher rights in favor of Mrs. Plinth, whose house made a more impressive\nsetting for the entertainment of celebrities; while, as Mrs. Leveret\nobserved, there was always the picture-gallery to fall back on.\n\nMrs. Plinth made no secret of sharing this view. She had always regarded\nit as one of her obligations to entertain the Lunch Club’s distinguished\nguests. Mrs. Plinth was almost as proud of her obligations as she was\nof her picture-gallery; she was in fact fond of implying that the one\npossession implied the other, and that only a woman of her wealth\ncould afford to live up to a standard as high as that which she had set\nherself. An all-round sense of duty, roughly adaptable to various ends,\nwas, in her opinion, all that Providence exacted of the more humbly\nstationed; but the power which had predestined Mrs. Plinth to keep\nfootmen clearly intended her to maintain an equally specialized staff of\nresponsibilities. It was the more to be regretted that Mrs. Ballinger,\nwhose obligations to society were bounded by the narrow scope of two\nparlour-maids, should have been so tenacious of the right to entertain\nOsric Dane.\n\nThe question of that lady’s reception had for a month past profoundly\nmoved the members of the Lunch Club. It was not that they felt\nthemselves unequal to the task, but that their sense of the opportunity\nplunged them into the agreeable uncertainty of the lady who weighs the\nalternatives of a well-stocked wardrobe. If such subsidiary members as\nMrs. Leveret were fluttered by the thought of exchanging ideas with the\nauthor of “The Wings of Death,” no forebodings of the kind disturbed the\nconscious adequacy of Mrs. Plinth, Mrs. Ballinger and Miss Van Vluyck.\n“The Wings of Death” had, in fact, at Miss Van Vluyck’s suggestion, been\nchosen as the subject of discussion at the last club meeting, and\neach member had thus been enabled to express her own opinion or to\nappropriate whatever seemed most likely to be of use in the comments\nof the others. Mrs. Roby alone had abstained from profiting by the\nopportunity thus offered; but it was now openly recognised that, as a\nmember of the Lunch Club, Mrs. Roby was a failure. “It all comes,” as\nMiss Van Vluyck put it, “of accepting a woman on a man’s estimation.”\n Mrs. Roby, returning to Hillbridge from a prolonged sojourn in exotic\nregions--the other ladies no longer took the trouble to remember\nwhere--had been emphatically commended by the distinguished biologist,\nProfessor Foreland, as the most agreeable woman he had ever met; and the\nmembers of the Lunch Club, awed by an encomium that carried the weight\nof a diploma, and rashly assuming that the Professor’s social sympathies\nwould follow the line of his scientific bent, had seized the chance of\nannexing a biological member. Their disillusionment was complete. At\nMiss Van Vluyck’s first off-hand mention of the pterodactyl Mrs. Roby\nhad confusedly murmured: “I know so little about metres--” and after\nthat painful betrayal of incompetence she had prudently withdrawn from\nfarther participation in the mental gymnastics of the club.\n\n“I suppose she flattered him,” Miss Van Vluyck summed up--“or else it’s\nthe way she does her hair.”\n\nThe dimensions of Miss Van Vluyck’s dining-room having restricted the\nmembership of the club to six, the non-conductiveness of one member was\na serious obstacle to the exchange of ideas, and some wonder had already\nbeen expressed that Mrs. Roby should care to live, as it were, on the\nintellectual bounty of the others. This feeling was augmented by the\ndiscovery that she had not yet read “The Wings of Death.” She owned\nto having heard the name of Osric Dane; but that--incredible as it\nappeared--was the extent of her acquaintance with the celebrated\nnovelist. The ladies could not conceal their surprise, but Mrs.\nBallinger, whose pride in the club made her wish to put even Mrs. Roby\nin the best possible light, gently insinuated that, though she had not\nhad time to acquaint herself with “The Wings of Death,” she must at\nleast be familiar with its equally remarkable predecessor, “The Supreme\nInstant.”\n\nMrs. Roby wrinkled her sunny brows in a conscientious effort of memory,\nas a result of which she recalled that, oh, yes, she HAD seen the book\nat her brother’s, when she was staying with him in Brazil, and had even\ncarried it off to read one day on a boating party; but they had all\ngot to shying things at each other in the boat, and the book had gone\noverboard, so she had never had the chance--\n\nThe picture evoked by this anecdote did not advance Mrs. Roby’s credit\nwith the club, and there was a painful pause, which was broken by\nMrs. Plinth’s remarking: “I can understand that, with all your other\npursuits, you should not find much time for reading; but I should have\nthought you might at least have GOT UP ‘The Wings of Death’ before Osric\nDane’s arrival.”\n\nMrs. Roby took this rebuke good-humouredly. She had meant, she owned\nto glance through the book; but she had been so absorbed in a novel of\nTrollope’s that--\n\n“No one reads Trollope now,” Mrs. Ballinger interrupted impatiently.\n\nMrs. Roby looked pained. “I’m only just beginning,” she confessed.\n\n“And does he interest you?” Mrs. Plinth inquired.\n\n“He amuses me.”\n\n“Amusement,” said Mrs. Plinth sententiously, “is hardly what I look for\nin my choice of books.”\n\n“Oh, certainly, ‘The Wings of Death’ is not amusing,” ventured Mrs.\nLeveret, whose manner of putting forth an opinion was like that of an\nobliging salesman with a variety of other styles to submit if his first\nselection does not suit.\n\n“Was it MEANT to be?” enquired Mrs. Plinth, who was fond of asking\nquestions that she permitted no one but herself to answer. “Assuredly\nnot.”\n\n“Assuredly not--that is what I was going to say,” assented Mrs. Leveret,\nhastily rolling up her opinion and reaching for another. “It was meant\nto--to elevate.”\n\nMiss Van Vluyck adjusted her spectacles as though they were the black\ncap of condemnation. “I hardly see,” she interposed, “how a book steeped\nin the bitterest pessimism can be said to elevate, however much it may\ninstruct.”\n\n“I meant, of course, to instruct,” said Mrs. Leveret, flurried by the\nunexpected distinction between two terms which she had supposed to be\nsynonymous. Mrs. Leveret’s enjoyment of the Lunch Club was frequently\nmarred by such surprises; and not knowing her own value to the other\nladies as a mirror for their mental complacency she was sometimes\ntroubled by a doubt of her worthiness to join in their debates. It was\nonly the fact of having a dull sister who thought her clever that saved\nher from a sense of hopeless inferiority.\n\n“Do they get married in the end?” Mrs. Roby interposed.\n\n“They--who?” the Lunch Club collectively exclaimed.\n\n“Why, the girl and man. It’s a novel, isn’t it? I always think that’s\nthe one thing that matters. If they’re parted it spoils my dinner.”\n\nMrs. Plinth and Mrs. Ballinger exchanged scandalised glances, and the\nlatter said: “I should hardly advise you to read ‘The Wings of Death,’\nin that spirit. For my part, when there are so many books that one HAS\nto read, I wonder how any one can find time for those that are merely\namusing.”\n\n“The beautiful part of it,” Laura Glyde murmured, “is surely just\nthis--that no one can tell HOW ‘The Wings of Death’ ends. Osric Dane,\novercome by the dread significance of her own meaning, has mercifully\nveiled it--perhaps even from herself--as Apelles, in representing the\nsacrifice of Iphigenia, veiled the face of Agamemnon.”\n\n“What’s that? Is it poetry?” whispered Mrs. Leveret nervously to Mrs.\nPlinth, who, disdaining a definite reply, said coldly: “You should\nlook it up. I always make it a point to look things up.” Her tone\nadded--“though I might easily have it done for me by the footman.”\n\n“I was about to say,” Miss Van Vluyck resumed, “that it must always be a\nquestion whether a book CAN instruct unless it elevates.”\n\n“Oh--” murmured Mrs. Leveret, now feeling herself hopelessly astray.\n\n“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Ballinger, scenting in Miss Van Vluyck’s tone\na tendency to depreciate the coveted distinction of entertaining Osric\nDane; “I don’t know that such a question can seriously be raised as to a\nbook which has attracted more attention among thoughtful people than any\nnovel since ‘Robert Elsmere.’”\n\n“Oh, but don’t you see,” exclaimed Laura Glyde, “that it’s just the\ndark hopelessness of it all--the wonderful tone-scheme of black on\nblack--that makes it such an artistic achievement? It reminded me so\nwhen I read it of Prince Rupert’s MANIÈRE NOIRE... the book is etched,\nnot painted, yet one feels the colour values so intensely...”\n\n“Who is HE?” Mrs. Leveret whispered to her neighbour. “Some one she’s\nmet abroad?”\n\n“The wonderful part of the book,” Mrs. Ballinger conceded, “is that it\nmay be looked at from so many points of view. I hear that as a study of\ndeterminism Professor Lupton ranks it with ‘The Data of Ethics.’”\n\n“I’m told that Osric Dane spent ten years in preparatory studies\nbefore beginning to write it,” said Mrs. Plinth. “She looks up\neverything--verifies everything. It has always been my principle, as\nyou know. Nothing would induce me, now, to put aside a book before I’d\nfinished it, just because I can buy as many more as I want.”\n\n“And what do YOU think of ‘The Wings of Death’?” Mrs. Roby abruptly\nasked her.\n\nIt was the kind of question that might be termed out of order, and the\nladies glanced at each other as though disclaiming any share in such a\nbreach of discipline. They all knew that there was nothing Mrs. Plinth\nso much disliked as being asked her opinion of a book. Books were\nwritten to read; if one read them what more could be expected? To be\nquestioned in detail regarding the contents of a volume seemed to her\nas great an outrage as being searched for smuggled laces at the Custom\nHouse. The club had always respected this idiosyncrasy of Mrs. Plinth’s.\nSuch opinions as she had were imposing and substantial: her mind, like\nher house, was furnished with monumental “pieces” that were not meant\nto be suddenly disarranged; and it was one of the unwritten rules of\nthe Lunch Club that, within her own province, each member’s habits\nof thought should be respected. The meeting therefore closed with\nan increased sense, on the part of the other ladies, of Mrs. Roby’s\nhopeless unfitness to be one of them.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nMrs. Leveret, on the eventful day, had arrived early at Mrs.\nBallinger’s, her volume of Appropriate Allusions in her pocket.\n\nIt always flustered Mrs. Leveret to be late at the Lunch Club: she liked\nto collect her thoughts and gather a hint, as the others assembled, of\nthe turn the conversation was likely to take. To-day, however, she\nfelt herself completely at a loss; and even the familiar contact of\nAppropriate Allusions, which stuck into her as she sat down, failed to\ngive her any reassurance. It was an admirable little volume, compiled\nto meet all the social emergencies; so that, whether on the occasion\nof Anniversaries, joyful or melancholy (as the classification ran),\nof Banquets, social or municipal, or of Baptisms, Church of England\nor sectarian, its student need never be at a loss for a pertinent\nreference. Mrs. Leveret, though she had for years devoutly conned its\npages, valued it, however, rather for its moral support than for its\npractical services; for though in the privacy of her own room she\ncommanded an army of quotations, these invariably deserted her at the\ncritical moment, and the only line she retained--CANST THOU DRAW OUT\nLEVIATHAN WITH A HOOK?--was one she had never yet found the occasion to\napply.\n\nTo-day she felt that even the complete mastery of the volume would\nhardly have insured her self-possession; for she thought it probable,\neven if she DID, in some miraculous way, remember an Allusion, it would\nbe only to find that Osric Dane used a different volume (Mrs. Leveret\nwas convinced that literary people always carried them), and would\nconsequently not recognise her quotations.\n\nMrs. Leveret’s sense of being adrift was intensified by the appearance\nof Mrs. Ballinger’s drawing-room. To a careless eye its aspect was\nunchanged; but those acquainted with Mrs. Ballinger’s way of\narranging her books would instantly have detected the marks of recent\nperturbation. Mrs. Ballinger’s province, as a member of the Lunch Club,\nwas the Book of the Day. On that, whatever it was, from a novel to\na treatise on experimental psychology, she was confidently,\nauthoritatively “up.” What became of last year’s books, or last week’s\neven; what she did with the “subjects” she had previously professed with\nequal authority; no one had ever yet discovered. Her mind was an hotel\nwhere facts came and went like transient lodgers, without leaving their\naddress behind, and frequently without paying for their board. It was\nMrs. Ballinger’s boast that she was “abreast with the Thought of the\nDay,” and her pride that this advanced position should be expressed by\nthe books on her drawing-room table. These volumes, frequently renewed,\nand almost always damp from the press, bore names generally unfamiliar\nto Mrs. Leveret, and giving her, as she furtively scanned them, a\ndisheartening glimpse of new fields of knowledge to be breathlessly\ntraversed in Mrs. Ballinger’s wake. But to-day a number of\nmaturer-looking volumes were adroitly mingled with the primeurs of the\npress--Karl Marx jostled Professor Bergson, and the “Confessions of St.\nAugustine” lay beside the last work on “Mendelism”; so that even to Mrs.\nLeveret’s fluttered perceptions it was clear that Mrs. Ballinger didn’t\nin the least know what Osric Dane was likely to talk about, and had\ntaken measures to be prepared for anything. Mrs. Leveret felt like a\npassenger on an ocean steamer who is told that there is no immediate\ndanger, but that she had better put on her life-belt.\n\nIt was a relief to be roused from these forebodings by Miss Van Vluyck’s\narrival.\n\n“Well, my dear,” the new-comer briskly asked her hostess, “what subjects\nare we to discuss to-day?”\n\nMrs. Ballinger was furtively replacing a volume of Wordsworth by a copy\nof Verlaine. “I hardly know,” she said somewhat nervously. “Perhaps we\nhad better leave that to circumstances.”\n\n“Circumstances?” said Miss Van Vluyck drily. “That means, I suppose,\nthat Laura Glyde will take the floor as usual, and we shall be deluged\nwith literature.”\n\nPhilanthropy and statistics were Miss Van Vluyck’s province, and she\nnaturally resented any tendency to divert their guest’s attention from\nthese topics.\n\nMrs. Plinth at this moment appeared.\n\n“Literature?” she protested in a tone of remonstrance. “But this is\nperfectly unexpected. I understood we were to talk of Osric Dane’s\nnovel.”\n\nMrs. Ballinger winced at the discrimination, but let it pass. “We can\nhardly make that our chief subject--at least not TOO intentionally,” she\nsuggested. “Of course we can let our talk DRIFT in that direction; but\nwe ought to have some other topic as an introduction, and that is what\nI wanted to consult you about. The fact is, we know so little of Osric\nDane’s tastes and interests that it is difficult to make any special\npreparation.”\n\n“It may be difficult,” said Mrs. Plinth with decision, “but it is\nabsolutely necessary. I know what that happy-go-lucky principle\nleads to. As I told one of my nieces the other day, there are certain\nemergencies for which a lady should always be prepared. It’s in shocking\ntaste to wear colours when one pays a visit of condolence, or a last\nyear’s dress when there are reports that one’s husband is on the wrong\nside of the market; and so it is with conversation. All I ask is that I\nshould know beforehand what is to be talked about; then I feel sure of\nbeing able to say the proper thing.”\n\n“I quite agree with you,” Mrs. Ballinger anxiously assented; “but--”\n\nAnd at that instant, heralded by the fluttered parlour-maid, Osric Dane\nappeared upon the threshold.\n\nMrs. Leveret told her sister afterward that she had known at a glance\nwhat was coming. She saw that Osric Dane was not going to meet them\nhalf way. That distinguished personage had indeed entered with an air of\ncompulsion not calculated to promote the easy exercise of hospitality.\nShe looked as though she were about to be photographed for a new edition\nof her books.\n\nThe desire to propitiate a divinity is generally in inverse ratio to its\nresponsiveness, and the sense of discouragement produced by Osric Dane’s\nentrance visibly increased the Lunch Club’s eagerness to please her. Any\nlingering idea that she might consider herself under an obligation to\nher entertainers was at once dispelled by her manner: as Mrs. Leveret\nsaid afterward to her sister, she had a way of looking at you that made\nyou feel as if there was something wrong with your hat. This evidence\nof greatness produced such an immediate impression on the ladies that a\nshudder of awe ran through them when Mrs. Roby, as their hostess led\nthe great personage into the dining-room, turned back to whisper to the\nothers: “What a brute she is!”\n\nThe hour about the table did not tend to correct this verdict. It was\npassed by Osric Dane in the silent deglutition of Mrs. Ballinger’s menu,\nand by the members of the Club in the emission of tentative platitudes\nwhich their guest seemed to swallow as perfunctorily as the successive\ncourses of the luncheon.\n\nMrs. Ballinger’s deplorable delay in fixing a topic had thrown the\nClub into a mental disarray which increased with the return to the\ndrawing-room, where the actual business of discussion was to open. Each\nlady waited for the other to speak; and there was a general shock\nof disappointment when their hostess opened the conversation by the\npainfully commonplace inquiry: “Is this your first visit to Hillbridge?”\n\nEven Mrs. Leveret was conscious that this was a bad beginning; and a\nvague impulse of deprecation made Miss Glyde interject: “It is a very\nsmall place indeed.”\n\nMrs. Plinth bristled. “We have a great many representative people,” she\nsaid, in the tone of one who speaks for her order.\n\nOsric Dane turned to her thoughtfully. “What do they represent?” she\nasked.\n\nMrs. Plinth’s constitutional dislike to being questioned was intensified\nby her sense of unpreparedness; and her reproachful glance passed the\nquestion on to Mrs. Ballinger.\n\n“Why,” said that lady, glancing in turn at the other members, “as a\ncommunity I hope it is not too much to say that we stand for culture.”\n\n“For art--” Miss Glyde eagerly interjected.\n\n“For art and literature,” Mrs. Ballinger emended.\n\n“And for sociology, I trust,” snapped Miss Van Vluyck.\n\n“We have a standard,” said Mrs. Plinth, feeling herself suddenly secure\non the vast expanse of a generalisation: and Mrs. Leveret, thinking\nthere must be room for more than one on so broad a statement, took\ncourage to murmur: “Oh, certainly; we have a standard.”\n\n“The object of our little club,” Mrs. Ballinger continued, “is to\nconcentrate the highest tendencies of Hillbridge--to centralise and\nfocus its complex intellectual effort.”\n\nThis was felt to be so happy that the ladies drew an almost audible\nbreath of relief.\n\n“We aspire,” the President went on, “to stand for what is highest in\nart, literature and ethics.”\n\nOsric Dane again turned to her. “What ethics?” she asked.\n\nA tremor of apprehension encircled the room. None of the ladies required\nany preparation to pronounce on a question of morals; but when they\nwere called ethics it was different. The club, when fresh from\nthe “Encyclopaedia Britannica,” the “Reader’s Handbook” or Smith’s\n“Classical Dictionary,” could deal confidently with any subject; but\nwhen taken unawares it had been known to define agnosticism as a heresy\nof the Early Church and Professor Froude as a distinguished histologist;\nand such minor members as Mrs. Leveret still secretly regarded ethics as\nsomething vaguely pagan.\n\nEven to Mrs. Ballinger, Osric Dane’s question was unsettling, and there\nwas a general sense of gratitude when Laura Glyde leaned forward to say,\nwith her most sympathetic accent: “You must excuse us, Mrs. Dane, for\nnot being able, just at present, to talk of anything but ‘The Wings of\nDeath.’”\n\n“Yes,” said Miss Van Vluyck, with a sudden resolve to carry the war into\nthe enemy’s camp. “We are so anxious to know the exact purpose you had\nin mind in writing your wonderful book.”\n\n“You will find,” Mrs. Plinth interposed, “that we are not superficial\nreaders.”\n\n“We are eager to hear from you,” Miss Van Vluyck continued, “if\nthe pessimistic tendency of the book is an expression of your own\nconvictions or--”\n\n“Or merely,” Miss Glyde hastily thrust in, “a sombre background brushed\nin to throw your figures into more vivid relief. ARE you not primarily\nplastic?”\n\n“I have always maintained,” Mrs. Ballinger interposed, “that you\nrepresent the purely objective method--”\n\nOsric Dane helped herself critically to coffee. “How do you define\nobjective?” she then inquired.\n\nThere was a flurried pause before Laura Glyde intensely murmured: “In\nreading YOU we don’t define, we feel.”\n\nOsric Dane smiled. “The cerebellum,” she remarked, “is not infrequently\nthe seat of the literary emotions.” And she took a second lump of sugar.\n\nThe sting that this remark was vaguely felt to conceal was almost\nneutralised by the satisfaction of being addressed in such technical\nlanguage.\n\n“Ah, the cerebellum,” said Miss Van Vluyck complacently. “The Club took\na course in psychology last winter.”\n\n“Which psychology?” asked Osric Dane.\n\nThere was an agonising pause, during which each member of the Club\nsecretly deplored the distressing inefficiency of the others. Only Mrs.\nRoby went on placidly sipping her chartreuse. At last Mrs. Ballinger\nsaid, with an attempt at a high tone: “Well, really, you know, it was\nlast year that we took psychology, and this winter we have been so\nabsorbed in--”\n\nShe broke off, nervously trying to recall some of the Club’s\ndiscussions; but her faculties seemed to be paralysed by the petrifying\nstare of Osric Dane. What HAD the club been absorbed in lately? Mrs.\nBallinger, with a vague purpose of gaining time, repeated slowly: “We’ve\nbeen so intensely absorbed in--”\n\nMrs. Roby put down her liqueur glass and drew near the group with a\nsmile.\n\n“In Xingu?” she gently prompted.\n\nA thrill ran through the other members. They exchanged confused\nglances, and then, with one accord, turned a gaze of mingled relief\nand interrogation on their unexpected rescuer. The expression of each\ndenoted a different phase of the same emotion. Mrs. Plinth was the first\nto compose her features to an air of reassurance: after a moment’s hasty\nadjustment her look almost implied that it was she who had given the\nword to Mrs. Ballinger.\n\n“Xingu, of course!” exclaimed the latter with her accustomed promptness,\nwhile Miss Van Vluyck and Laura Glyde seemed to be plumbing the depths\nof memory, and Mrs. Leveret, feeling apprehensively for Appropriate\nAllusions, was somehow reassured by the uncomfortable pressure of its\nbulk against her person.\n\nOsric Dane’s change of countenance was no less striking than that of\nher entertainers. She too put down her coffee-cup, but with a look of\ndistinct annoyance: she too wore, for a brief moment, what Mrs. Roby\nafterward described as the look of feeling for something in the back\nof her head; and before she could dissemble these momentary signs of\nweakness, Mrs. Roby, turning to her with a deferential smile, had said:\n“And we’ve been so hoping that to-day you would tell us just what you\nthink of it.”\n\nOsric Dane received the homage of the smile as a matter of course; but\nthe accompanying question obviously embarrassed her, and it became clear\nto her observers that she was not quick at shifting her facial scenery.\nIt was as though her countenance had so long been set in an expression\nof unchallenged superiority that the muscles had stiffened, and refused\nto obey her orders.\n\n“Xingu--” she murmured, as if seeking in her turn to gain time.\n\nMrs. Roby continued to press her. “Knowing how engrossing the subject\nis, you will understand how it happens that the Club has let everything\nelse go to the wall for the moment. Since we took up Xingu I might\nalmost say--were it not for your books--that nothing else seems to us\nworth remembering.”\n\nOsric Dane’s stern features were darkened rather than lit up by an\nuneasy smile. “I am glad to hear there is one exception,” she gave out\nbetween narrowed lips.\n\n“Oh, of course,” Mrs. Roby said prettily; “but as you have shown us\nthat--so very naturally!--you don’t care to talk about your own things,\nwe really can’t let you off from telling us exactly what you think about\nXingu; especially,” she added, with a persuasive smile, “as some people\nsay that one of your last books was simply saturated with it.”\n\nIt was an IT, then--the assurance sped like fire through the parched\nminds of the other members. In their eagerness to gain the least\nlittle clue to Xingu they almost forgot the joy of assisting at the\ndiscomfiture of Mrs. Dane.\n\nThe latter reddened nervously under her antagonist’s direct assault.\n“May I ask,” she faltered out in an embarrassed tone, “to which of my\nbooks you refer?”\n\nMrs. Roby did not falter. “That’s just what I want you to tell us;\nbecause, though I was present, I didn’t actually take part.”\n\n“Present at what?” Mrs. Dane took her up; and for an instant the\ntrembling members of the Lunch Club thought that the champion Providence\nhad raised up for them had lost a point. But Mrs. Roby explained herself\ngaily: “At the discussion, of course. And so we’re dreadfully anxious to\nknow just how it was that you went into the Xingu.”\n\nThere was a portentous pause, a silence so big with incalculable dangers\nthat the members with one accord checked the words on their lips, like\nsoldiers dropping their arms to watch a single combat between their\nleaders. Then Mrs. Dane gave expression to their inmost dread by saying\nsharply: “Ah--you say THE Xingu, do you?”\n\nMrs. Roby smiled undauntedly. “It IS a shade pedantic, isn’t it?\nPersonally, I always drop the article; but I don’t know how the other\nmembers feel about it.”\n\nThe other members looked as though they would willingly have dispensed\nwith this deferential appeal to their opinion, and Mrs. Roby, after a\nbright glance about the group, went on: “They probably think, as I do,\nthat nothing really matters except the thing itself--except Xingu.”\n\nNo immediate reply seemed to occur to Mrs. Dane, and Mrs. Ballinger\ngathered courage to say: “Surely every one must feel that about Xingu.”\n\nMrs. Plinth came to her support with a heavy murmur of assent, and Laura\nGlyde breathed emotionally: “I have known cases where it has changed a\nwhole life.”\n\n“It has done me worlds of good,” Mrs. Leveret interjected, seeming\nto herself to remember that she had either taken it or read it in the\nwinter before.\n\n“Of course,” Mrs. Roby admitted, “the difficulty is that one must give\nup so much time to it. It’s very long.”\n\n“I can’t imagine,” said Miss Van Vluyck tartly, “grudging the time given\nto such a subject.”\n\n“And deep in places,” Mrs. Roby pursued; (so then it was a book!) “And\nit isn’t easy to skip.”\n\n“I never skip,” said Mrs. Plinth dogmatically.\n\n“Ah, it’s dangerous to, in Xingu. Even at the start there are places\nwhere one can’t. One must just wade through.”\n\n“I should hardly call it WADING,” said Mrs. Ballinger sarcastically.\n\nMrs. Roby sent her a look of interest. “Ah--you always found it went\nswimmingly?”\n\nMrs. Ballinger hesitated. “Of course there are difficult passages,” she\nconceded modestly.\n\n“Yes; some are not at all clear--even,” Mrs. Roby added, “if one is\nfamiliar with the original.”\n\n“As I suppose you are?” Osric Dane interposed, suddenly fixing her with\na look of challenge.\n\nMrs. Roby met it by a deprecating smile. “Oh, it’s really not difficult\nup to a certain point; though some of the branches are very little\nknown, and it’s almost impossible to get at the source.”\n\n“Have you ever tried?” Mrs. Plinth enquired, still distrustful of Mrs.\nRoby’s thoroughness.\n\nMrs. Roby was silent for a moment; then she replied with lowered lids:\n“No--but a friend of mine did; a very brilliant man; and he told me it\nwas best for women--not to...”\n\nA shudder ran around the room. Mrs. Leveret coughed so that the\nparlour-maid, who was handing the cigarettes, should not hear; Miss Van\nVluyck’s face took on a nauseated expression, and Mrs. Plinth looked as\nif she were passing some one she did not care to bow to. But the most\nremarkable result of Mrs. Roby’s words was the effect they produced on\nthe Lunch Club’s distinguished guest. Osric Dane’s impassive features\nsuddenly melted to an expression of the warmest human sympathy, and\nedging her chair toward Mrs. Roby’s she asked: “Did he really? And--did\nyou find he was right?”\n\nMrs. Ballinger, in whom annoyance at Mrs. Roby’s unwonted assumption\nof prominence was beginning to displace gratitude for the aid she had\nrendered, could not consent to her being allowed, by such dubious means,\nto monopolise the attention of their guest. If Osric Dane had not enough\nself-respect to resent Mrs. Roby’s flippancy, at least the Lunch Club\nwould do so in the person of its President.\n\nMrs. Ballinger laid her hand on Mrs. Roby’s arm. “We must not forget,”\n she said with a frigid amiability, “that absorbing as Xingu is to US, it\nmay be less interesting to--”\n\n“Oh, no, on the contrary, I assure you,” Osric Dane energetically\nintervened.\n\n“--to others,” Mrs. Ballinger finished firmly; “and we must not allow\nour little meeting to end without persuading Mrs. Dane to say a few\nwords to us on a subject which, to-day, is much more present in all our\nthoughts. I refer, of course, to ‘The Wings of Death.’”\n\nThe other members, animated by various degrees of the same sentiment,\nand encouraged by the humanised mien of their redoubtable guest,\nrepeated after Mrs. Ballinger: “Oh, yes, you really MUST talk to us a\nlittle about your book.”\n\nOsric Dane’s expression became as bored, though not as haughty, as when\nher work had been previously mentioned. But before she could respond\nto Mrs. Ballinger’s request, Mrs. Roby had risen from her seat, and was\npulling her veil down over her frivolous nose.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” she said, advancing toward her hostess with outstretched\nhand, “but before Mrs. Dane begins I think I’d better run away.\nUnluckily, as you know, I haven’t read her books, so I should be at a\nterrible disadvantage among you all; and besides, I’ve an engagement to\nplay bridge.”\n\nIf Mrs. Roby had simply pleaded her ignorance of Osric Dane’s works as\na reason for withdrawing, the Lunch Club, in view of her recent prowess,\nmight have approved such evidence of discretion; but to couple this\nexcuse with the brazen announcement that she was foregoing the privilege\nfor the purpose of joining a bridge-party, was only one more instance of\nher deplorable lack of discrimination.\n\nThe ladies were disposed, however, to feel that her departure--now\nthat she had performed the sole service she was ever likely to render\nthem--would probably make for greater order and dignity in the impending\ndiscussion, besides relieving them of the sense of self-distrust which\nher presence always mysteriously produced. Mrs. Ballinger therefore\nrestricted herself to a formal murmur of regret, and the other members\nwere just grouping themselves comfortably about Osric Dane when the\nlatter, to their dismay, started up from the sofa on which she had been\ndeferentially enthroned.\n\n“Oh wait--do wait, and I’ll go with you!” she called out to Mrs. Roby;\nand, seizing the hands of the disconcerted members, she administered\na series of farewell pressures with the mechanical haste of a\nrailway-conductor punching tickets.\n\n“I’m so sorry--I’d quite forgotten--” she flung back at them from the\nthreshold; and as she joined Mrs. Roby, who had turned in surprise at\nher appeal, the other ladies had the mortification of hearing her say,\nin a voice which she did not take the pains to lower: “If you’ll let\nme walk a little way with you, I should so like to ask you a few more\nquestions about Xingu...”\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe incident had been so rapid that the door closed on the departing\npair before the other members had had time to understand what was\nhappening. Then a sense of the indignity put upon them by Osric Dane’s\nunceremonious desertion began to contend with the confused feeling that\nthey had been cheated out of their due without exactly knowing how or\nwhy.\n\nThere was an awkward silence, during which Mrs. Ballinger, with a\nperfunctory hand, rearranged the skilfully grouped literature at which\nher distinguished guest had not so much as glanced; then Miss Van Vluyck\ntartly pronounced: “Well, I can’t say that I consider Osric Dane’s\ndeparture a great loss.”\n\nThis confession crystallised the fluid resentment of the other members,\nand Mrs. Leveret exclaimed: “I do believe she came on purpose to be\nnasty!”\n\nIt was Mrs. Plinth’s private opinion that Osric Dane’s attitude toward\nthe Lunch Club might have been very different had it welcomed her in the\nmajestic setting of the Plinth drawing-rooms; but not liking to reflect\non the inadequacy of Mrs. Ballinger’s establishment she sought a\nround-about satisfaction in depreciating her savoir faire.\n\n“I said from the first that we ought to have had a subject ready. It’s\nwhat always happens when you’re unprepared. Now if we’d only got up\nXingu--”\n\nThe slowness of Mrs. Plinth’s mental processes was always allowed for\nby the Club; but this instance of it was too much for Mrs. Ballinger’s\nequanimity.\n\n“Xingu!” she scoffed. “Why, it was the fact of our knowing so much more\nabout it than she did--unprepared though we were--that made Osric Dane\nso furious. I should have thought that was plain enough to everybody!”\n\nThis retort impressed even Mrs. Plinth, and Laura Glyde, moved by an\nimpulse of generosity, said: “Yes, we really ought to be grateful\nto Mrs. Roby for introducing the topic. It may have made Osric Dane\nfurious, but at least it made her civil.”\n\n“I am glad we were able to show her,” added Miss Van Vluyck, “that a\nbroad and up-to-date culture is not confined to the great intellectual\ncentres.”\n\nThis increased the satisfaction of the other members, and they began\nto forget their wrath against Osric Dane in the pleasure of having\ncontributed to her defeat.\n\nMiss Van Vluyck thoughtfully rubbed her spectacles. “What surprised me\nmost,” she continued, “was that Fanny Roby should be so up on Xingu.”\n\nThis frank admission threw a slight chill on the company, but Mrs.\nBallinger said with an air of indulgent irony: “Mrs. Roby always has the\nknack of making a little go a long way; still, we certainly owe her a\ndebt for happening to remember that she’d heard of Xingu.” And this was\nfelt by the other members to be a graceful way of cancelling once for\nall the Club’s obligation to Mrs. Roby.\n\nEven Mrs. Leveret took courage to speed a timid shaft of irony: “I fancy\nOsric Dane hardly expected to take a lesson in Xingu at Hillbridge!”\n\nMrs. Ballinger smiled. “When she asked me what we represented--do you\nremember?--I wish I’d simply said we represented Xingu!”\n\nAll the ladies laughed appreciatively at this sally, except Mrs. Plinth,\nwho said, after a moment’s deliberation: “I’m not sure it would have\nbeen wise to do so.”\n\nMrs. Ballinger, who was already beginning to feel as if she had\nlaunched at Osric Dane the retort which had just occurred to her, looked\nironically at Mrs. Plinth. “May I ask why?” she enquired.\n\nMrs. Plinth looked grave. “Surely,” she said, “I understood from Mrs.\nRoby herself that the subject was one it was as well not to go into too\ndeeply?”\n\nMiss Van Vluyck rejoined with precision: “I think that applied only to\nan investigation of the origin of the--of the--“; and suddenly she found\nthat her usually accurate memory had failed her. “It’s a part of the\nsubject I never studied myself,” she concluded lamely.\n\n“Nor I,” said Mrs. Ballinger.\n\nLaura Glyde bent toward them with widened eyes. “And yet it\nseems--doesn’t it?--the part that is fullest of an esoteric\nfascination?”\n\n“I don’t know on what you base that,” said Miss Van Vluyck\nargumentatively.\n\n“Well, didn’t you notice how intensely interested Osric Dane became\nas soon as she heard what the brilliant foreigner--he WAS a foreigner,\nwasn’t he?--had told Mrs. Roby about the origin--the origin of the\nrite--or whatever you call it?”\n\nMrs. Plinth looked disapproving, and Mrs. Ballinger visibly wavered.\nThen she said in a decisive tone: “It may not be desirable to touch on\nthe--on that part of the subject in general conversation; but, from the\nimportance it evidently has to a woman of Osric Dane’s distinction,\nI feel as if we ought not to be afraid to discuss it among\nourselves--without gloves--though with closed doors, if necessary.”\n\n“I’m quite of your opinion,” Miss Van Vluyck came briskly to her\nsupport; “on condition, that is, that all grossness of language is\navoided.”\n\n“Oh, I’m sure we shall understand without that,” Mrs. Leveret tittered;\nand Laura Glyde added significantly: “I fancy we can read between the\nlines,” while Mrs. Ballinger rose to assure herself that the doors were\nreally closed.\n\nMrs. Plinth had not yet given her adhesion. “I hardly see,” she\nbegan, “what benefit is to be derived from investigating such peculiar\ncustoms--”\n\nBut Mrs. Ballinger’s patience had reached the extreme limit of tension.\n“This at least,” she returned; “that we shall not be placed again in the\nhumiliating position of finding ourselves less up on our own subjects\nthan Fanny Roby!”\n\nEven to Mrs. Plinth this argument was conclusive. She peered furtively\nabout the room and lowered her commanding tones to ask: “Have you got a\ncopy?”\n\n“A--a copy?” stammered Mrs. Ballinger. She was aware that the other\nmembers were looking at her expectantly, and that this answer was\ninadequate, so she supported it by asking another question. “A copy of\nwhat?”\n\nHer companions bent their expectant gaze on Mrs. Plinth, who, in turn,\nappeared less sure of herself than usual. “Why, of--of--the book,” she\nexplained.\n\n“What book?” snapped Miss Van Vluyck, almost as sharply as Osric Dane.\n\nMrs. Ballinger looked at Laura Glyde, whose eyes were interrogatively\nfixed on Mrs. Leveret. The fact of being deferred to was so new to\nthe latter that it filled her with an insane temerity. “Why, Xingu, of\ncourse!” she exclaimed.\n\nA profound silence followed this direct challenge to the resources\nof Mrs. Ballinger’s library, and the latter, after glancing nervously\ntoward the Books of the Day, returned in a deprecating voice: “It’s not\na thing one cares to leave about.”\n\n“I should think NOT!” exclaimed Mrs. Plinth.\n\n“It IS a book, then?” said Miss Van Vluyck.\n\nThis again threw the company into disarray, and Mrs. Ballinger, with an\nimpatient sigh, rejoined: “Why--there IS a book--naturally...”\n\n“Then why did Miss Glyde call it a religion?”\n\nLaura Glyde started up. “A religion? I never--”\n\n“Yes, you did,” Miss Van Vluyck insisted; “you spoke of rites; and Mrs.\nPlinth said it was a custom.”\n\nMiss Glyde was evidently making a desperate effort to reinforce her\nstatement; but accuracy of detail was not her strongest point. At length\nshe began in a deep murmur: “Surely they used to do something of the\nkind at the Eleusinian mysteries--”\n\n“Oh--” said Miss Van Vluyck, on the verge of disapproval; and Mrs.\nPlinth protested: “I understood there was to be no indelicacy!”\n\nMrs. Ballinger could not control her irritation. “Really, it is too\nbad that we should not be able to talk the matter over quietly among\nourselves. Personally, I think that if one goes into Xingu at all--”\n\n“Oh, so do I!” cried Miss Glyde.\n\n“And I don’t see how one can avoid doing so, if one wishes to keep up\nwith the Thought of the Day--”\n\nMrs. Leveret uttered an exclamation of relief. “There--that’s it!” she\ninterposed.\n\n“What’s it?” the President curtly took her up.\n\n“Why--it’s a--a Thought: I mean a philosophy.”\n\nThis seemed to bring a certain relief to Mrs. Ballinger and Laura Glyde,\nbut Miss Van Vluyck said dogmatically: “Excuse me if I tell you that\nyou’re all mistaken. Xingu happens to be a language.”\n\n“A language!” the Lunch Club cried.\n\n“Certainly. Don’t you remember Fanny Roby’s saying that there were\nseveral branches, and that some were hard to trace? What could that\napply to but dialects?”\n\nMrs. Ballinger could no longer restrain a contemptuous laugh. “Really,\nif the Lunch Club has reached such a pass that it has to go to Fanny\nRoby for instruction on a subject like Xingu, it had almost better cease\nto exist!”\n\n“It’s really her fault for not being clearer,” Laura Glyde put in.\n\n“Oh, clearness and Fanny Roby!” Mrs. Ballinger shrugged. “I daresay we\nshall find she was mistaken on almost every point.”\n\n“Why not look it up?” said Mrs. Plinth.\n\nAs a rule this recurrent suggestion of Mrs. Plinth’s was ignored in the\nheat of discussion, and only resorted to afterward in the privacy of\neach member’s home. But on the present occasion the desire to ascribe\ntheir own confusion of thought to the vague and contradictory nature of\nMrs. Roby’s statements caused the members of the Lunch Club to utter a\ncollective demand for a book of reference.\n\nAt this point the production of her treasured volume gave Mrs. Leveret,\nfor a moment, the unusual experience of occupying the centre front; but\nshe was not able to hold it long, for Appropriate Allusions contained no\nmention of Xingu.\n\n“Oh, that’s not the kind of thing we want!” exclaimed Miss Van Vluyck.\nShe cast a disparaging glance over Mrs. Ballinger’s assortment of\nliterature, and added impatiently: “Haven’t you any useful books?”\n\n“Of course I have,” replied Mrs. Ballinger indignantly; “but I keep them\nin my husband’s dressing-room.”\n\nFrom this region, after some difficulty and delay, the parlour-maid\nproduced the W-Z volume of an Encyclopaedia and, in deference to the\nfact that the demand for it had come from Miss Van Vluyck, laid the\nponderous tome before her.\n\nThere was a moment of painful suspense while Miss Van Vluyck rubbed her\nspectacles, adjusted them, and turned to Z; and a murmur of surprise\nwhen she said: “It isn’t here.”\n\n“I suppose,” said Mrs. Plinth, “it’s not fit to be put in a book of\nreference.”\n\n“Oh, nonsense!” exclaimed Mrs. Ballinger. “Try X.”\n\nMiss Van Vluyck turned back through the volume, peering short-sightedly\nup and down the pages, till she came to a stop and remained motionless,\nlike a dog on a point.\n\n“Well, have you found it?” Mrs. Ballinger enquired, after a considerable\ndelay.\n\n“Yes. I’ve found it,” said Miss Van Vluyck in a queer voice.\n\nMrs. Plinth hastily interposed: “I beg you won’t read it aloud if\nthere’s anything offensive.”\n\nMiss Van Vluyck, without answering, continued her silent scrutiny.\n\n“Well, what IS it?” exclaimed Laura Glyde excitedly.\n\n“DO tell us!” urged Mrs. Leveret, feeling that she would have something\nawful to tell her sister.\n\nMiss Van Vluyck pushed the volume aside and turned slowly toward the\nexpectant group.\n\n“It’s a river.”\n\n“A RIVER?”\n\n“Yes: in Brazil. Isn’t that where she’s been living?”\n\n“Who? Fanny Roby? Oh, but you must be mistaken. You’ve been reading the\nwrong thing,” Mrs. Ballinger exclaimed, leaning over her to seize the\nvolume.\n\n“It’s the only XINGU in the Encyclopaedia; and she HAS been living in\nBrazil,” Miss Van Vluyck persisted.\n\n“Yes: her brother has a consulship there,” Mrs. Leveret eagerly\ninterposed.\n\n“But it’s too ridiculous! I--we--why we ALL remember studying Xingu last\nyear--or the year before last,” Mrs. Ballinger stammered.\n\n“I thought I did when YOU said so,” Laura Glyde avowed.\n\n“I said so?” cried Mrs. Ballinger.\n\n“Yes. You said it had crowded everything else out of your mind.”\n\n“Well, YOU said it had changed your whole life!”\n\n“For that matter, Miss Van Vluyck said she had never grudged the time\nshe’d given it.”\n\nMrs. Plinth interposed: “I made it clear that I knew nothing whatever of\nthe original.”\n\nMrs. Ballinger broke off the dispute with a groan. “Oh, what does it\nall matter if she’s been making fools of us? I believe Miss Van Vluyck’s\nright--she was talking of the river all the while!”\n\n“How could she? It’s too preposterous,” Miss Glyde exclaimed.\n\n“Listen.” Miss Van Vluyck had repossessed herself of the Encyclopaedia,\nand restored her spectacles to a nose reddened by excitement. “‘The\nXingu, one of the principal rivers of Brazil, rises on the plateau of\nMato Grosso, and flows in a northerly direction for a length of no less\nthan one thousand one hundred and eighteen miles, entering the Amazon\nnear the mouth of the latter river. The upper course of the Xingu is\nauriferous and fed by numerous branches. Its source was first discovered\nin 1884 by the German explorer von den Steinen, after a difficult and\ndangerous expedition through a region inhabited by tribes still in the\nStone Age of culture.’”\n\nThe ladies received this communication in a state of stupefied silence\nfrom which Mrs. Leveret was the first to rally. “She certainly DID speak\nof its having branches.”\n\nThe word seemed to snap the last thread of their incredulity. “And of\nits great length,” gasped Mrs. Ballinger.\n\n“She said it was awfully deep, and you couldn’t skip--you just had to\nwade through,” Miss Glyde subjoined.\n\nThe idea worked its way more slowly through Mrs. Plinth’s compact\nresistances. “How could there be anything improper about a river?” she\ninquired.\n\n“Improper?”\n\n“Why, what she said about the source--that it was corrupt?”\n\n“Not corrupt, but hard to get at,” Laura Glyde corrected. “Some\none who’d been there had told her so. I daresay it was the explorer\nhimself--doesn’t it say the expedition was dangerous?”\n\n“‘Difficult and dangerous,’” read Miss Van Vluyck.\n\nMrs. Ballinger pressed her hands to her throbbing temples. “There’s\nnothing she said that wouldn’t apply to a river--to this river!” She\nswung about excitedly to the other members. “Why, do you remember her\ntelling us that she hadn’t read ‘The Supreme Instant’ because she’d\ntaken it on a boating party while she was staying with her brother,\nand some one had ‘shied’ it overboard--‘shied’ of course was her own\nexpression?”\n\nThe ladies breathlessly signified that the expression had not escaped\nthem.\n\n“Well--and then didn’t she tell Osric Dane that one of her books was\nsimply saturated with Xingu? Of course it was, if some of Mrs. Roby’s\nrowdy friends had thrown it into the river!”\n\nThis surprising reconstruction of the scene in which they had just\nparticipated left the members of the Lunch Club inarticulate. At length\nMrs. Plinth, after visibly labouring with the problem, said in a heavy\ntone: “Osric Dane was taken in too.”\n\nMrs. Leveret took courage at this. “Perhaps that’s what Mrs. Roby did\nit for. She said Osric Dane was a brute, and she may have wanted to give\nher a lesson.”\n\nMiss Van Vluyck frowned. “It was hardly worth while to do it at our\nexpense.”\n\n“At least,” said Miss Glyde with a touch of bitterness, “she succeeded\nin interesting her, which was more than we did.”\n\n“What chance had we?” rejoined Mrs. Ballinger. “Mrs. Roby monopolised\nher from the first. And THAT, I’ve no doubt, was her purpose--to give\nOsric Dane a false impression of her own standing in the Club. She would\nhesitate at nothing to attract attention: we all know how she took in\npoor Professor Foreland.”\n\n“She actually makes him give bridge-teas every Thursday,” Mrs. Leveret\npiped up.\n\nLaura Glyde struck her hands together. “Why, this is Thursday, and it’s\nTHERE she’s gone, of course; and taken Osric with her!”\n\n“And they’re shrieking over us at this moment,” said Mrs. Ballinger\nbetween her teeth.\n\nThis possibility seemed too preposterous to be admitted. “She would\nhardly dare,” said Miss Van Vluyck, “confess the imposture to Osric\nDane.”\n\n“I’m not so sure: I thought I saw her make a sign as she left. If she\nhadn’t made a sign, why should Osric Dane have rushed out after her?”\n\n“Well, you know, we’d all been telling her how wonderful Xingu was, and\nshe said she wanted to find out more about it,” Mrs. Leveret said, with\na tardy impulse of justice to the absent.\n\nThis reminder, far from mitigating the wrath of the other members, gave\nit a stronger impetus.\n\n“Yes--and that’s exactly what they’re both laughing over now,” said\nLaura Glyde ironically.\n\nMrs. Plinth stood up and gathered her expensive furs about her\nmonumental form. “I have no wish to criticise,” she said; “but unless\nthe Lunch Club can protect its members against the recurrence of\nsuch--such unbecoming scenes, I for one--”\n\n“Oh, so do I!” agreed Miss Glyde, rising also.\n\nMiss Van Vluyck closed the Encyclopaedia and proceeded to button herself\ninto her jacket. “My time is really too valuable--” she began.\n\n“I fancy we are all of one mind,” said Mrs. Ballinger, looking\nsearchingly at Mrs. Leveret, who looked at the others.\n\n“I always deprecate anything like a scandal--” Mrs. Plinth continued.\n\n“She has been the cause of one to-day!” exclaimed Miss Glyde.\n\nMrs. Leveret moaned: “I don’t see how she COULD!” and Miss Van Vluyck\nsaid, picking up her note-book: “Some women stop at nothing.”\n\n“--but if,” Mrs. Plinth took up her argument impressively, “anything\nof the kind had happened in MY house” (it never would have, her tone\nimplied), “I should have felt that I owed it to myself either to ask for\nMrs. Roby’s resignation--or to offer mine.”\n\n“Oh, Mrs. Plinth--” gasped the Lunch Club.\n\n“Fortunately for me,” Mrs. Plinth continued with an awful magnanimity,\n“the matter was taken out of my hands by our President’s decision that\nthe right to entertain distinguished guests was a privilege vested in\nher office; and I think the other members will agree that, as she was\nalone in this opinion, she ought to be alone in deciding on the best way\nof effacing its--its really deplorable consequences.”\n\nA deep silence followed this unexpected outbreak of Mrs. Plinth’s\nlong-stored resentment.\n\n“I don’t see why I should be expected to ask her to resign--” Mrs.\nBallinger at length began; but Laura Glyde turned back to remind her:\n“You know she made you say that you’d got on swimmingly in Xingu.”\n\nAn ill-timed giggle escaped from Mrs. Leveret, and Mrs. Ballinger\nenergetically continued “--but you needn’t think for a moment that I’m\nafraid to!”\n\nThe door of the drawing-room closed on the retreating backs of the\nLunch Club, and the President of that distinguished association, seating\nherself at her writing-table, and pushing away a copy of “The Wings\nof Death” to make room for her elbow, drew forth a sheet of the club’s\nnote-paper, on which she began to write: “My dear Mrs. Roby--”\n\n\nThe End of Xingu\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nJune 1908\n\n\nI had always thought Jack Gisburn rather a cheap genius--though a good\nfellow enough--so it was no great surprise to me to hear that, in the\nheight of his glory, he had dropped his painting, married a rich widow,\nand established himself in a villa on the Riviera. (Though I rather\nthought it would have been Rome or Florence.)\n\n“The height of his glory”--that was what the women called it. I can hear\nMrs. Gideon Thwing--his last Chicago sitter--deploring his unaccountable\nabdication. “Of course it’s going to send the value of my picture ‘way\nup; but I don’t think of that, Mr. Rickham--the loss to Arrt is all I\nthink of.” The word, on Mrs. Thwing’s lips, multiplied its RS as though\nthey were reflected in an endless vista of mirrors. And it was not only\nthe Mrs. Thwings who mourned. Had not the exquisite Hermia Croft, at the\nlast Grafton Gallery show, stopped me before Gisburn’s “Moon-dancers” to\nsay, with tears in her eyes: “We shall not look upon its like again”?\n\nWell!--even through the prism of Hermia’s tears I felt able to face the\nfact with equanimity. Poor Jack Gisburn! The women had made him--it was\nfitting that they should mourn him. Among his own sex fewer regrets\nwere heard, and in his own trade hardly a murmur. Professional jealousy?\nPerhaps. If it were, the honour of the craft was vindicated by little\nClaude Nutley, who, in all good faith, brought out in the Burlington a\nvery handsome “obituary” on Jack--one of those showy articles stocked\nwith random technicalities that I have heard (I won’t say by whom)\ncompared to Gisburn’s painting. And so--his resolve being apparently\nirrevocable--the discussion gradually died out, and, as Mrs. Thwing had\npredicted, the price of “Gisburns” went up.\n\nIt was not till three years later that, in the course of a few weeks’\nidling on the Riviera, it suddenly occurred to me to wonder why Gisburn\nhad given up his painting. On reflection, it really was a tempting\nproblem. To accuse his wife would have been too easy--his fair sitters\nhad been denied the solace of saying that Mrs. Gisburn had “dragged him\ndown.” For Mrs. Gisburn--as such--had not existed till nearly a year\nafter Jack’s resolve had been taken. It might be that he had married\nher--since he liked his ease--because he didn’t want to go on painting;\nbut it would have been hard to prove that he had given up his painting\nbecause he had married her.\n\nOf course, if she had not dragged him down, she had equally, as Miss\nCroft contended, failed to “lift him up”--she had not led him back to\nthe easel. To put the brush into his hand again--what a vocation for\na wife! But Mrs. Gisburn appeared to have disdained it--and I felt it\nmight be interesting to find out why.\n\nThe desultory life of the Riviera lends itself to such purely academic\nspeculations; and having, on my way to Monte Carlo, caught a glimpse\nof Jack’s balustraded terraces between the pines, I had myself borne\nthither the next day.\n\nI found the couple at tea beneath their palm-trees; and Mrs. Gisburn’s\nwelcome was so genial that, in the ensuing weeks, I claimed it\nfrequently. It was not that my hostess was “interesting”: on that point\nI could have given Miss Croft the fullest reassurance. It was just\nbecause she was NOT interesting--if I may be pardoned the bull--that I\nfound her so. For Jack, all his life, had been surrounded by interesting\nwomen: they had fostered his art, it had been reared in the hot-house\nof their adulation. And it was therefore instructive to note what effect\nthe “deadening atmosphere of mediocrity” (I quote Miss Croft) was having\non him.\n\nI have mentioned that Mrs. Gisburn was rich; and it was immediately\nperceptible that her husband was extracting from this circumstance a\ndelicate but substantial satisfaction. It is, as a rule, the people who\nscorn money who get most out of it; and Jack’s elegant disdain of\nhis wife’s big balance enabled him, with an appearance of perfect\ngood-breeding, to transmute it into objects of art and luxury. To the\nlatter, I must add, he remained relatively indifferent; but he was\nbuying Renaissance bronzes and eighteenth-century pictures with a\ndiscrimination that bespoke the amplest resources.\n\n“Money’s only excuse is to put beauty into circulation,” was one of\nthe axioms he laid down across the Sèvres and silver of an exquisitely\nappointed luncheon-table, when, on a later day, I had again run over\nfrom Monte Carlo; and Mrs. Gisburn, beaming on him, added for my\nenlightenment: “Jack is so morbidly sensitive to every form of beauty.”\n\nPoor Jack! It had always been his fate to have women say such things of\nhim: the fact should be set down in extenuation. What struck me now\nwas that, for the first time, he resented the tone. I had seen him, so\noften, basking under similar tributes--was it the conjugal note that\nrobbed them of their savour? No--for, oddly enough, it became apparent\nthat he was fond of Mrs. Gisburn--fond enough not to see her absurdity.\nIt was his own absurdity he seemed to be wincing under--his own attitude\nas an object for garlands and incense.\n\n“My dear, since I’ve chucked painting people don’t say that stuff about\nme--they say it about Victor Grindle,” was his only protest, as he rose\nfrom the table and strolled out onto the sunlit terrace.\n\nI glanced after him, struck by his last word. Victor Grindle was, in\nfact, becoming the man of the moment--as Jack himself, one might put it,\nhad been the man of the hour. The younger artist was said to have formed\nhimself at my friend’s feet, and I wondered if a tinge of jealousy\nunderlay the latter’s mysterious abdication. But no--for it was not\ntill after that event that the rose Dubarry drawing-rooms had begun to\ndisplay their “Grindles.”\n\nI turned to Mrs. Gisburn, who had lingered to give a lump of sugar to\nher spaniel in the dining-room.\n\n“Why HAS he chucked painting?” I asked abruptly.\n\nShe raised her eyebrows with a hint of good-humoured surprise.\n\n“Oh, he doesn’t HAVE to now, you know; and I want him to enjoy himself,”\n she said quite simply.\n\nI looked about the spacious white-panelled room, with its FAMILLE-VERTE\nvases repeating the tones of the pale damask curtains, and its\neighteenth-century pastels in delicate faded frames.\n\n“Has he chucked his pictures too? I haven’t seen a single one in the\nhouse.”\n\nA slight shade of constraint crossed Mrs. Gisburn’s open countenance.\n“It’s his ridiculous modesty, you know. He says they’re not fit to have\nabout; he’s sent them all away except one--my portrait--and that I have\nto keep upstairs.”\n\nHis ridiculous modesty--Jack’s modesty about his pictures? My curiosity\nwas growing like the bean-stalk. I said persuasively to my hostess: “I\nmust really see your portrait, you know.”\n\nShe glanced out almost timorously at the terrace where her husband,\nlounging in a hooded chair, had lit a cigar and drawn the Russian\ndeerhound’s head between his knees.\n\n“Well, come while he’s not looking,” she said, with a laugh that tried\nto hide her nervousness; and I followed her between the marble Emperors\nof the hall, and up the wide stairs with terra-cotta nymphs poised among\nflowers at each landing.\n\nIn the dimmest corner of her boudoir, amid a profusion of delicate and\ndistinguished objects, hung one of the familiar oval canvases, in the\ninevitable garlanded frame. The mere outline of the frame called up all\nGisburn’s past!\n\nMrs. Gisburn drew back the window-curtains, moved aside a JARDINIÈRE\nfull of pink azaleas, pushed an arm-chair away, and said: “If you stand\nhere you can just manage to see it. I had it over the mantel-piece, but\nhe wouldn’t let it stay.”\n\nYes--I could just manage to see it--the first portrait of Jack’s I\nhad ever had to strain my eyes over! Usually they had the place\nof honour--say the central panel in a pale yellow or rose Dubarry\ndrawing-room, or a monumental easel placed so that it took the light\nthrough curtains of old Venetian point. The more modest place became the\npicture better; yet, as my eyes grew accustomed to the half-light, all\nthe characteristic qualities came out--all the hesitations disguised\nas audacities, the tricks of prestidigitation by which, with such\nconsummate skill, he managed to divert attention from the real business\nof the picture to some pretty irrelevance of detail. Mrs. Gisburn,\npresenting a neutral surface to work on--forming, as it were, so\ninevitably the background of her own picture--had lent herself in an\nunusual degree to the display of this false virtuosity. The picture\nwas one of Jack’s “strongest,” as his admirers would have put it--it\nrepresented, on his part, a swelling of muscles, a congesting of\nveins, a balancing, straddling and straining, that reminded one of the\ncircus-clown’s ironic efforts to lift a feather. It met, in short, at\nevery point the demand of lovely woman to be painted “strongly” because\nshe was tired of being painted “sweetly”--and yet not to lose an atom of\nthe sweetness.\n\n“It’s the last he painted, you know,” Mrs. Gisburn said with pardonable\npride. “The last but one,” she corrected herself--“but the other doesn’t\ncount, because he destroyed it.”\n\n“Destroyed it?” I was about to follow up this clue when I heard a\nfootstep and saw Jack himself on the threshold.\n\nAs he stood there, his hands in the pockets of his velveteen coat, the\nthin brown waves of hair pushed back from his white forehead, his\nlean sunburnt cheeks furrowed by a smile that lifted the tips of a\nself-confident moustache, I felt to what a degree he had the same\nquality as his pictures--the quality of looking cleverer than he was.\n\nHis wife glanced at him deprecatingly, but his eyes travelled past her\nto the portrait.\n\n“Mr. Rickham wanted to see it,” she began, as if excusing herself. He\nshrugged his shoulders, still smiling.\n\n“Oh, Rickham found me out long ago,” he said lightly; then, passing his\narm through mine: “Come and see the rest of the house.”\n\nHe showed it to me with a kind of naive suburban pride: the bath-rooms,\nthe speaking-tubes, the dress-closets, the trouser-presses--all the\ncomplex simplifications of the millionaire’s domestic economy. And\nwhenever my wonder paid the expected tribute he said, throwing out\nhis chest a little: “Yes, I really don’t see how people manage to live\nwithout that.”\n\nWell--it was just the end one might have foreseen for him. Only he was,\nthrough it all and in spite of it all--as he had been through, and in\nspite of, his pictures--so handsome, so charming, so disarming, that one\nlonged to cry out: “Be dissatisfied with your leisure!” as once one had\nlonged to say: “Be dissatisfied with your work!”\n\nBut, with the cry on my lips, my diagnosis suffered an unexpected check.\n\n“This is my own lair,” he said, leading me into a dark plain room at\nthe end of the florid vista. It was square and brown and leathery: no\n“effects”; no bric-a-brac, none of the air of posing for reproduction in\na picture weekly--above all, no least sign of ever having been used as a\nstudio.\n\nThe fact brought home to me the absolute finality of Jack’s break with\nhis old life.\n\n“Don’t you ever dabble with paint any more?” I asked, still looking\nabout for a trace of such activity.\n\n“Never,” he said briefly.\n\n“Or water-colour--or etching?”\n\nHis confident eyes grew dim, and his cheeks paled a little under their\nhandsome sunburn.\n\n“Never think of it, my dear fellow--any more than if I’d never touched a\nbrush.”\n\nAnd his tone told me in a flash that he never thought of anything else.\n\nI moved away, instinctively embarrassed by my unexpected discovery; and\nas I turned, my eye fell on a small picture above the mantel-piece--the\nonly object breaking the plain oak panelling of the room.\n\n“Oh, by Jove!” I said.\n\nIt was a sketch of a donkey--an old tired donkey, standing in the rain\nunder a wall.\n\n“By Jove--a Stroud!” I cried.\n\nHe was silent; but I felt him close behind me, breathing a little\nquickly.\n\n“What a wonder! Made with a dozen lines--but on everlasting foundations.\nYou lucky chap, where did you get it?”\n\nHe answered slowly: “Mrs. Stroud gave it to me.”\n\n“Ah--I didn’t know you even knew the Strouds. He was such an inflexible\nhermit.”\n\n“I didn’t--till after.... She sent for me to paint him when he was\ndead.”\n\n“When he was dead? You?”\n\nI must have let a little too much amazement escape through my surprise,\nfor he answered with a deprecating laugh: “Yes--she’s an awful\nsimpleton, you know, Mrs. Stroud. Her only idea was to have him done by\na fashionable painter--ah, poor Stroud! She thought it the surest way\nof proclaiming his greatness--of forcing it on a purblind public. And at\nthe moment I was THE fashionable painter.”\n\n“Ah, poor Stroud--as you say. Was THAT his history?”\n\n“That was his history. She believed in him, gloried in him--or thought\nshe did. But she couldn’t bear not to have all the drawing-rooms with\nher. She couldn’t bear the fact that, on varnishing days, one could\nalways get near enough to see his pictures. Poor woman! She’s just a\nfragment groping for other fragments. Stroud is the only whole I ever\nknew.”\n\n“You ever knew? But you just said--”\n\nGisburn had a curious smile in his eyes.\n\n“Oh, I knew him, and he knew me--only it happened after he was dead.”\n\nI dropped my voice instinctively. “When she sent for you?”\n\n“Yes--quite insensible to the irony. She wanted him vindicated--and by\nme!”\n\nHe laughed again, and threw back his head to look up at the sketch\nof the donkey. “There were days when I couldn’t look at that\nthing--couldn’t face it. But I forced myself to put it here; and now\nit’s cured me--cured me. That’s the reason why I don’t dabble any more,\nmy dear Rickham; or rather Stroud himself is the reason.”\n\nFor the first time my idle curiosity about my companion turned into a\nserious desire to understand him better.\n\n“I wish you’d tell me how it happened,” I said.\n\nHe stood looking up at the sketch, and twirling between his fingers a\ncigarette he had forgotten to light. Suddenly he turned toward me.\n\n“I’d rather like to tell you--because I’ve always suspected you of\nloathing my work.”\n\nI made a deprecating gesture, which he negatived with a good-humoured\nshrug.\n\n“Oh, I didn’t care a straw when I believed in myself--and now it’s an\nadded tie between us!”\n\nHe laughed slightly, without bitterness, and pushed one of the deep\narm-chairs forward. “There: make yourself comfortable--and here are the\ncigars you like.”\n\nHe placed them at my elbow and continued to wander up and down the room,\nstopping now and then beneath the picture.\n\n“How it happened? I can tell you in five minutes--and it didn’t take\nmuch longer to happen.... I can remember now how surprised and pleased\nI was when I got Mrs. Stroud’s note. Of course, deep down, I had always\nFELT there was no one like him--only I had gone with the stream, echoed\nthe usual platitudes about him, till I half got to think he was a\nfailure, one of the kind that are left behind. By Jove, and he WAS left\nbehind--because he had come to stay! The rest of us had to let ourselves\nbe swept along or go under, but he was high above the current--on\neverlasting foundations, as you say.\n\n“Well, I went off to the house in my most egregious mood--rather moved,\nLord forgive me, at the pathos of poor Stroud’s career of failure being\ncrowned by the glory of my painting him! Of course I meant to do the\npicture for nothing--I told Mrs. Stroud so when she began to stammer\nsomething about her poverty. I remember getting off a prodigious phrase\nabout the honour being MINE--oh, I was princely, my dear Rickham! I was\nposing to myself like one of my own sitters.\n\n“Then I was taken up and left alone with him. I had sent all my traps in\nadvance, and I had only to set up the easel and get to work. He had been\ndead only twenty-four hours, and he died suddenly, of heart disease,\nso that there had been no preliminary work of destruction--his face\nwas clear and untouched. I had met him once or twice, years before, and\nthought him insignificant and dingy. Now I saw that he was superb.\n\n“I was glad at first, with a merely aesthetic satisfaction: glad to have\nmy hand on such a ‘subject.’ Then his strange life-likeness began\nto affect me queerly--as I blocked the head in I felt as if he were\nwatching me do it. The sensation was followed by the thought: if he WERE\nwatching me, what would he say to my way of working? My strokes began to\ngo a little wild--I felt nervous and uncertain.\n\n“Once, when I looked up, I seemed to see a smile behind his close\ngrayish beard--as if he had the secret, and were amusing himself by\nholding it back from me. That exasperated me still more. The secret?\nWhy, I had a secret worth twenty of his! I dashed at the canvas\nfuriously, and tried some of my bravura tricks. But they failed me,\nthey crumbled. I saw that he wasn’t watching the showy bits--I couldn’t\ndistract his attention; he just kept his eyes on the hard passages\nbetween. Those were the ones I had always shirked, or covered up with\nsome lying paint. And how he saw through my lies!\n\n“I looked up again, and caught sight of that sketch of the donkey\nhanging on the wall near his bed. His wife told me afterward it was the\nlast thing he had done--just a note taken with a shaking hand, when he\nwas down in Devonshire recovering from a previous heart attack. Just\na note! But it tells his whole history. There are years of patient\nscornful persistence in every line. A man who had swum with the current\ncould never have learned that mighty up-stream stroke....\n\n“I turned back to my work, and went on groping and muddling; then I\nlooked at the donkey again. I saw that, when Stroud laid in the first\nstroke, he knew just what the end would be. He had possessed his\nsubject, absorbed it, recreated it. When had I done that with any of my\nthings? They hadn’t been born of me--I had just adopted them....\n\n“Hang it, Rickham, with that face watching me I couldn’t do another\nstroke. The plain truth was, I didn’t know where to put it--I HAD NEVER\nKNOWN. Only, with my sitters and my public, a showy splash of colour\ncovered up the fact--I just threw paint into their faces.... Well, paint\nwas the one medium those dead eyes could see through--see straight to\nthe tottering foundations underneath. Don’t you know how, in talking\na foreign language, even fluently, one says half the time not what one\nwants to but what one can? Well--that was the way I painted; and as he\nlay there and watched me, the thing they called my ‘technique’ collapsed\nlike a house of cards. He didn’t sneer, you understand, poor Stroud--he\njust lay there quietly watching, and on his lips, through the gray\nbeard, I seemed to hear the question: ‘Are you sure you know where\nyou’re coming out?’\n\n“If I could have painted that face, with that question on it, I should\nhave done a great thing. The next greatest thing was to see that I\ncouldn’t--and that grace was given me. But, oh, at that minute, Rickham,\nwas there anything on earth I wouldn’t have given to have Stroud alive\nbefore me, and to hear him say: ‘It’s not too late--I’ll show you how’?\n\n“It WAS too late--it would have been, even if he’d been alive. I packed\nup my traps, and went down and told Mrs. Stroud. Of course I didn’t\ntell her THAT--it would have been Greek to her. I simply said I couldn’t\npaint him, that I was too moved. She rather liked the idea--she’s so\nromantic! It was that that made her give me the donkey. But she was\nterribly upset at not getting the portrait--she did so want him ‘done’\nby some one showy! At first I was afraid she wouldn’t let me off--and at\nmy wits’ end I suggested Grindle. Yes, it was I who started Grindle: I\ntold Mrs. Stroud he was the ‘coming’ man, and she told somebody else,\nand so it got to be true.... And he painted Stroud without wincing; and\nshe hung the picture among her husband’s things....”\n\nHe flung himself down in the arm-chair near mine, laid back his head,\nand clasping his arms beneath it, looked up at the picture above the\nchimney-piece.\n\n“I like to fancy that Stroud himself would have given it to me, if he’d\nbeen able to say what he thought that day.”\n\nAnd, in answer to a question I put half-mechanically--“Begin again?”\n he flashed out. “When the one thing that brings me anywhere near him is\nthat I knew enough to leave off?”\n\nHe stood up and laid his hand on my shoulder with a laugh. “Only the\nirony of it is that I AM still painting--since Grindle’s doing it\nfor me! The Strouds stand alone, and happen once--but there’s no\nexterminating our kind of art.”\n\n\nThe End of The Verdict\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE RECKONING\n\nAugust, 1902\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n“The marriage law of the new dispensation will be: THOU SHALT NOT BE\nUNFAITHFUL--TO THYSELF.”\n\nA discreet murmur of approval filled the studio, and through the haze of\ncigarette smoke Mrs. Clement Westall, as her husband descended from his\nimprovised platform, saw him merged in a congratulatory group of ladies.\nWestall’s informal talks on “The New Ethics” had drawn about him an\neager following of the mentally unemployed--those who, as he had once\nphrased it, liked to have their brain-food cut up for them. The talks\nhad begun by accident. Westall’s ideas were known to be “advanced,” but\nhitherto their advance had not been in the direction of publicity. He\nhad been, in his wife’s opinion, almost pusillanimously careful not\nto let his personal views endanger his professional standing. Of late,\nhowever, he had shown a puzzling tendency to dogmatize, to throw down\nthe gauntlet, to flaunt his private code in the face of society; and the\nrelation of the sexes being a topic always sure of an audience, a few\nadmiring friends had persuaded him to give his after-dinner opinions a\nlarger circulation by summing them up in a series of talks at the Van\nSideren studio.\n\nThe Herbert Van Siderens were a couple who subsisted, socially, on\nthe fact that they had a studio. Van Sideren’s pictures were chiefly\nvaluable as accessories to the MISE EN SCÈNE which differentiated his\nwife’s “afternoons” from the blighting functions held in long New York\ndrawing-rooms, and permitted her to offer their friends whiskey-and-soda\ninstead of tea. Mrs. Van Sideren, for her part, was skilled in making\nthe most of the kind of atmosphere which a lay-figure and an easel\ncreate; and if at times she found the illusion hard to maintain, and\nlost courage to the extent of almost wishing that Herbert could paint,\nshe promptly overcame such moments of weakness by calling in some fresh\ntalent, some extraneous re-enforcement of the “artistic” impression. It\nwas in quest of such aid that she had seized on Westall, coaxing him,\nsomewhat to his wife’s surprise, into a flattered participation in her\nfraud. It was vaguely felt, in the Van Sideren circle, that all the\naudacities were artistic, and that a teacher who pronounced marriage\nimmoral was somehow as distinguished as a painter who depicted\npurple grass and a green sky. The Van Sideren set were tired of the\nconventional color-scheme in art and conduct.\n\nJulia Westall had long had her own views on the immorality of marriage;\nshe might indeed have claimed her husband as a disciple. In the early\ndays of their union she had secretly resented his disinclination to\nproclaim himself a follower of the new creed; had been inclined to tax\nhim with moral cowardice, with a failure to live up to the convictions\nfor which their marriage was supposed to stand. That was in the\nfirst burst of propagandism, when, womanlike, she wanted to turn her\ndisobedience into a law. Now she felt differently. She could hardly\naccount for the change, yet being a woman who never allowed her impulses\nto remain unaccounted for, she tried to do so by saying that she did not\ncare to have the articles of her faith misinterpreted by the vulgar. In\nthis connection, she was beginning to think that almost every one was\nvulgar; certainly there were few to whom she would have cared to intrust\nthe defence of so esoteric a doctrine. And it was precisely at this\npoint that Westall, discarding his unspoken principles, had chosen to\ndescend from the heights of privacy, and stand hawking his convictions\nat the street-corner!\n\nIt was Una Van Sideren who, on this occasion, unconsciously focussed\nupon herself Mrs. Westall’s wandering resentment. In the first place,\nthe girl had no business to be there. It was “horrid”--Mrs. Westall\nfound herself slipping back into the old feminine vocabulary--simply\n“horrid” to think of a young girl’s being allowed to listen to such\ntalk. The fact that Una smoked cigarettes and sipped an occasional\ncocktail did not in the least tarnish a certain radiant innocency which\nmade her appear the victim, rather than the accomplice, of her parents’\nvulgarities. Julia Westall felt in a hot helpless way that something\nought to be done--that some one ought to speak to the girl’s mother. And\njust then Una glided up.\n\n“Oh, Mrs. Westall, how beautiful it was!” Una fixed her with large\nlimpid eyes. “You believe it all, I suppose?” she asked with seraphic\ngravity.\n\n“All--what, my dear child?”\n\nThe girl shone on her. “About the higher life--the freer expansion of\nthe individual--the law of fidelity to one’s self,” she glibly recited.\n\nMrs. Westall, to her own wonder, blushed a deep and burning blush.\n\n“My dear Una,” she said, “you don’t in the least understand what it’s\nall about!”\n\nMiss Van Sideren stared, with a slowly answering blush. “Don’t YOU,\nthen?” she murmured.\n\nMrs. Westall laughed. “Not always--or altogether! But I should like some\ntea, please.”\n\nUna led her to the corner where innocent beverages were dispensed. As\nJulia received her cup she scrutinized the girl more carefully. It was\nnot such a girlish face, after all--definite lines were forming under\nthe rosy haze of youth. She reflected that Una must be six-and-twenty,\nand wondered why she had not married. A nice stock of ideas she would\nhave as her dower! If THEY were to be a part of the modern girl’s\ntrousseau--\n\nMrs. Westall caught herself up with a start. It was as though some one\nelse had been speaking--a stranger who had borrowed her own voice: she\nfelt herself the dupe of some fantastic mental ventriloquism. Concluding\nsuddenly that the room was stifling and Una’s tea too sweet, she set\ndown her cup, and looked about for Westall: to meet his eyes had long\nbeen her refuge from every uncertainty. She met them now, but only,\nas she felt, in transit; they included her parenthetically in a larger\nflight. She followed the flight, and it carried her to a corner to which\nUna had withdrawn--one of the palmy nooks to which Mrs. Van Sideren\nattributed the success of her Saturdays. Westall, a moment later, had\novertaken his look, and found a place at the girl’s side. She bent\nforward, speaking eagerly; he leaned back, listening, with the\ndepreciatory smile which acted as a filter to flattery, enabling him\nto swallow the strongest doses without apparent grossness of appetite.\nJulia winced at her own definition of the smile.\n\n\nOn the way home, in the deserted winter dusk, Westall surprised his wife\nby a sudden boyish pressure of her arm. “Did I open their eyes a bit?\nDid I tell them what you wanted me to?” he asked gaily.\n\nAlmost unconsciously, she let her arm slip from his. “What I wanted--?”\n\n“Why, haven’t you--all this time?” She caught the honest wonder of his\ntone. “I somehow fancied you’d rather blamed me for not talking more\nopenly--before-- You’ve made me feel, at times, that I was sacrificing\nprinciples to expediency.”\n\nShe paused a moment over her reply; then she asked quietly: “What made\nyou decide not to--any longer?”\n\nShe felt again the vibration of a faint surprise. “Why--the wish to\nplease you!” he answered, almost too simply.\n\n“I wish you would not go on, then,” she said abruptly.\n\nHe stopped in his quick walk, and she felt his stare through the\ndarkness.\n\n“Not go on--?”\n\n“Call a hansom, please. I’m tired,” broke from her with a sudden rush of\nphysical weariness.\n\nInstantly his solicitude enveloped her. The room had been infernally\nhot--and then that confounded cigarette smoke--he had noticed once or\ntwice that she looked pale--she mustn’t come to another Saturday. She\nfelt herself yielding, as she always did, to the warm influence of his\nconcern for her, the feminine in her leaning on the man in him with a\nconscious intensity of abandonment. He put her in the hansom, and her\nhand stole into his in the darkness. A tear or two rose, and she let\nthem fall. It was so delicious to cry over imaginary troubles!\n\nThat evening, after dinner, he surprised her by reverting to the subject\nof his talk. He combined a man’s dislike of uncomfortable questions\nwith an almost feminine skill in eluding them; and she knew that if he\nreturned to the subject he must have some special reason for doing so.\n\n“You seem not to have cared for what I said this afternoon. Did I put\nthe case badly?”\n\n“No--you put it very well.”\n\n“Then what did you mean by saying that you would rather not have me go\non with it?”\n\nShe glanced at him nervously, her ignorance of his intention deepening\nher sense of helplessness.\n\n“I don’t think I care to hear such things discussed in public.”\n\n“I don’t understand you,” he exclaimed. Again the feeling that his\nsurprise was genuine gave an air of obliquity to her own attitude. She\nwas not sure that she understood herself.\n\n“Won’t you explain?” he said with a tinge of impatience. Her eyes\nwandered about the familiar drawing-room which had been the scene of so\nmany of their evening confidences. The shaded lamps, the quiet-colored\nwalls hung with mezzotints, the pale spring flowers scattered here and\nthere in Venice glasses and bowls of old Sèvres, recalled, she hardly\nknew why, the apartment in which the evenings of her first marriage had\nbeen passed--a wilderness of rosewood and upholstery, with a picture of\na Roman peasant above the mantel-piece, and a Greek slave in “statuary\nmarble” between the folding-doors of the back drawing-room. It was a\nroom with which she had never been able to establish any closer relation\nthan that between a traveller and a railway station; and now, as\nshe looked about at the surroundings which stood for her deepest\naffinities--the room for which she had left that other room--she was\nstartled by the same sense of strangeness and unfamiliarity. The prints,\nthe flowers, the subdued tones of the old porcelains, seemed to typify a\nsuperficial refinement that had no relation to the deeper significances\nof life.\n\nSuddenly she heard her husband repeating his question.\n\n“I don’t know that I can explain,” she faltered.\n\nHe drew his arm-chair forward so that he faced her across the hearth.\nThe light of a reading-lamp fell on his finely drawn face, which had\na kind of surface-sensitiveness akin to the surface-refinement of its\nsetting.\n\n“Is it that you no longer believe in our ideas?” he asked.\n\n“In our ideas--?”\n\n“The ideas I am trying to teach. The ideas you and I are supposed to\nstand for.” He paused a moment. “The ideas on which our marriage was\nfounded.”\n\nThe blood rushed to her face. He had his reasons, then--she was sure now\nthat he had his reasons! In the ten years of their marriage, how\noften had either of them stopped to consider the ideas on which it was\nfounded? How often does a man dig about the basement of his house to\nexamine its foundation? The foundation is there, of course--the house\nrests on it--but one lives abovestairs and not in the cellar. It\nwas she, indeed, who in the beginning had insisted on reviewing the\nsituation now and then, on recapitulating the reasons which justified\nher course, on proclaiming, from time to time, her adherence to the\nreligion of personal independence; but she had long ceased to feel\nthe need of any such ideal standards, and had accepted her marriage as\nfrankly and naturally as though it had been based on the primitive needs\nof the heart, and needed no special sanction to explain or justify it.\n\n“Of course I still believe in our ideas!” she exclaimed.\n\n“Then I repeat that I don’t understand. It was a part of your theory\nthat the greatest possible publicity should be given to our view of\nmarriage. Have you changed your mind in that respect?”\n\nShe hesitated. “It depends on circumstances--on the public one is\naddressing. The set of people that the Van Siderens get about them don’t\ncare for the truth or falseness of a doctrine. They are attracted simply\nby its novelty.”\n\n“And yet it was in just such a set of people that you and I met, and\nlearned the truth from each other.”\n\n“That was different.”\n\n“In what way?”\n\n“I was not a young girl, to begin with. It is perfectly unfitting that\nyoung girls should be present at--at such times--should hear such things\ndiscussed--”\n\n“I thought you considered it one of the deepest social wrongs that such\nthings never ARE discussed before young girls; but that is beside\nthe point, for I don’t remember seeing any young girl in my audience\nto-day--”\n\n“Except Una Van Sideren!”\n\nHe turned slightly and pushed back the lamp at his elbow.\n\n“Oh, Miss Van Sideren--naturally--”\n\n“Why naturally?”\n\n“The daughter of the house--would you have had her sent out with her\ngoverness?”\n\n“If I had a daughter I should not allow such things to go on in my\nhouse!”\n\nWestall, stroking his mustache, leaned back with a faint smile. “I fancy\nMiss Van Sideren is quite capable of taking care of herself.”\n\n“No girl knows how to take care of herself--till it’s too late.”\n\n“And yet you would deliberately deny her the surest means of\nself-defence?”\n\n“What do you call the surest means of self-defence?”\n\n“Some preliminary knowledge of human nature in its relation to the\nmarriage tie.”\n\nShe made an impatient gesture. “How should you like to marry that kind\nof a girl?”\n\n“Immensely--if she were my kind of girl in other respects.”\n\nShe took up the argument at another point.\n\n“You are quite mistaken if you think such talk does not affect young\ngirls. Una was in a state of the most absurd exaltation--” She broke\noff, wondering why she had spoken.\n\nWestall reopened a magazine which he had laid aside at the beginning\nof their discussion. “What you tell me is immensely flattering to my\noratorical talent--but I fear you overrate its effect. I can assure you\nthat Miss Van Sideren doesn’t have to have her thinking done for her.\nShe’s quite capable of doing it herself.”\n\n“You seem very familiar with her mental processes!” flashed unguardedly\nfrom his wife.\n\nHe looked up quietly from the pages he was cutting.\n\n“I should like to be,” he answered. “She interests me.”\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIf there be a distinction in being misunderstood, it was one denied to\nJulia Westall when she left her first husband. Every one was ready to\nexcuse and even to defend her. The world she adorned agreed that John\nArment was “impossible,” and hostesses gave a sigh of relief at the\nthought that it would no longer be necessary to ask him to dine.\n\nThere had been no scandal connected with the divorce: neither side\nhad accused the other of the offence euphemistically described as\n“statutory.” The Arments had indeed been obliged to transfer their\nallegiance to a State which recognized desertion as a cause for divorce,\nand construed the term so liberally that the seeds of desertion were\nshown to exist in every union. Even Mrs. Arment’s second marriage did\nnot make traditional morality stir in its sleep. It was known that she\nhad not met her second husband till after she had parted from the first,\nand she had, moreover, replaced a rich man by a poor one. Though Clement\nWestall was acknowledged to be a rising lawyer, it was generally felt\nthat his fortunes would not rise as rapidly as his reputation. The\nWestalls would probably always have to live quietly and go out to\ndinner in cabs. Could there be better evidence of Mrs. Arment’s complete\ndisinterestedness?\n\nIf the reasoning by which her friends justified her course was somewhat\ncruder and less complex than her own elucidation of the matter, both\nexplanations led to the same conclusion: John Arment was impossible. The\nonly difference was that, to his wife, his impossibility was something\ndeeper than a social disqualification. She had once said, in ironical\ndefence of her marriage, that it had at least preserved her from\nthe necessity of sitting next to him at dinner; but she had not then\nrealized at what cost the immunity was purchased. John Arment was\nimpossible; but the sting of his impossibility lay in the fact that he\nmade it impossible for those about him to be other than himself. By\nan unconscious process of elimination he had excluded from the world\neverything of which he did not feel a personal need: had become, as it\nwere, a climate in which only his own requirements survived. This might\nseem to imply a deliberate selfishness; but there was nothing deliberate\nabout Arment. He was as instinctive as an animal or a child. It was this\nchildish element in his nature which sometimes for a moment unsettled\nhis wife’s estimate of him. Was it possible that he was simply\nundeveloped, that he had delayed, somewhat longer than is usual, the\nlaborious process of growing up? He had the kind of sporadic shrewdness\nwhich causes it to be said of a dull man that he is “no fool”; and it\nwas this quality that his wife found most trying. Even to the naturalist\nit is annoying to have his deductions disturbed by some unforeseen\naberrancy of form or function; and how much more so to the wife whose\nestimate of herself is inevitably bound up with her judgment of her\nhusband!\n\nArment’s shrewdness did not, indeed, imply any latent intellectual\npower; it suggested, rather, potentialities of feeling, of suffering,\nperhaps, in a blind rudimentary way, on which Julia’s sensibilities\nnaturally declined to linger. She so fully understood her own\nreasons for leaving him that she disliked to think they were not as\ncomprehensible to her husband. She was haunted, in her analytic moments,\nby the look of perplexity, too inarticulate for words, with which he had\nacquiesced to her explanations.\n\nThese moments were rare with her, however. Her marriage had been too\nconcrete a misery to be surveyed philosophically. If she had been\nunhappy for complex reasons, the unhappiness was as real as though it\nhad been uncomplicated. Soul is more bruisable than flesh, and Julia was\nwounded in every fibre of her spirit. Her husband’s personality seemed\nto be closing gradually in on her, obscuring the sky and cutting off\nthe air, till she felt herself shut up among the decaying bodies of\nher starved hopes. A sense of having been decoyed by some world-old\nconspiracy into this bondage of body and soul filled her with despair.\nIf marriage was the slow life-long acquittal of a debt contracted in\nignorance, then marriage was a crime against human nature. She, for one,\nwould have no share in maintaining the pretence of which she had been a\nvictim: the pretence that a man and a woman, forced into the narrowest\nof personal relations, must remain there till the end, though they\nmay have outgrown the span of each other’s natures as the mature tree\noutgrows the iron brace about the sapling.\n\nIt was in the first heat of her moral indignation that she had met\nClement Westall. She had seen at once that he was “interested,” and had\nfought off the discovery, dreading any influence that should draw her\nback into the bondage of conventional relations. To ward off the peril\nshe had, with an almost crude precipitancy, revealed her opinions to\nhim. To her surprise, she found that he shared them. She was attracted\nby the frankness of a suitor who, while pressing his suit, admitted that\nhe did not believe in marriage. Her worst audacities did not seem to\nsurprise him: he had thought out all that she had felt, and they had\nreached the same conclusion. People grew at varying rates, and the yoke\nthat was an easy fit for the one might soon become galling to the other.\nThat was what divorce was for: the readjustment of personal relations.\nAs soon as their necessarily transitive nature was recognized they would\ngain in dignity as well as in harmony. There would be no farther need\nof the ignoble concessions and connivances, the perpetual sacrifice of\npersonal delicacy and moral pride, by means of which imperfect marriages\nwere now held together. Each partner to the contract would be on his\nmettle, forced to live up to the highest standard of self-development,\non pain of losing the other’s respect and affection. The low nature\ncould no longer drag the higher down, but must struggle to rise, or\nremain alone on its inferior level. The only necessary condition to a\nharmonious marriage was a frank recognition of this truth, and a solemn\nagreement between the contracting parties to keep faith with themselves,\nand not to live together for a moment after complete accord had ceased\nto exist between them. The new adultery was unfaithfulness to self.\n\nIt was, as Westall had just reminded her, on this understanding that\nthey had married. The ceremony was an unimportant concession to social\nprejudice: now that the door of divorce stood open, no marriage need\nbe an imprisonment, and the contract therefore no longer involved any\ndiminution of self-respect. The nature of their attachment placed\nthem so far beyond the reach of such contingencies that it was easy to\ndiscuss them with an open mind; and Julia’s sense of security made her\ndwell with a tender insistence on Westall’s promise to claim his release\nwhen he should cease to love her. The exchange of these vows seemed\nto make them, in a sense, champions of the new law, pioneers in the\nforbidden realm of individual freedom: they felt that they had somehow\nachieved beatitude without martyrdom.\n\nThis, as Julia now reviewed the past, she perceived to have been her\ntheoretical attitude toward marriage. It was unconsciously, insidiously,\nthat her ten years of happiness with Westall had developed another\nconception of the tie; a reversion, rather, to the old instinct of\npassionate dependency and possessorship that now made her blood revolt\nat the mere hint of change. Change? Renewal? Was that what they\nhad called it, in their foolish jargon? Destruction, extermination\nrather--this rending of a myriad fibres interwoven with another’s being!\nAnother? But he was not other! He and she were one, one in the mystic\nsense which alone gave marriage its significance. The new law was not\nfor them, but for the disunited creatures forced into a mockery of\nunion. The gospel she had felt called on to proclaim had no bearing on\nher own case.... She sent for the doctor and told him she was sure she\nneeded a nerve tonic.\n\nShe took the nerve tonic diligently, but it failed to act as a sedative\nto her fears. She did not know what she feared; but that made her\nanxiety the more pervasive. Her husband had not reverted to the subject\nof his Saturday talks. He was unusually kind and considerate, with a\nsoftening of his quick manner, a touch of shyness in his consideration,\nthat sickened her with new fears. She told herself that it was because\nshe looked badly--because he knew about the doctor and the nerve\ntonic--that he showed this deference to her wishes, this eagerness to\nscreen her from moral draughts; but the explanation simply cleared the\nway for fresh inferences.\n\nThe week passed slowly, vacantly, like a prolonged Sunday. On Saturday\nthe morning post brought a note from Mrs. Van Sideren. Would dear Julia\nask Mr. Westall to come half an hour earlier than usual, as there was to\nbe some music after his “talk”? Westall was just leaving for his office\nwhen his wife read the note. She opened the drawing-room door and called\nhim back to deliver the message.\n\nHe glanced at the note and tossed it aside. “What a bore! I shall have\nto cut my game of racquets. Well, I suppose it can’t be helped. Will you\nwrite and say it’s all right?”\n\nJulia hesitated a moment, her hand stiffening on the chair-back against\nwhich she leaned.\n\n“You mean to go on with these talks?” she asked.\n\n“I--why not?” he returned; and this time it struck her that his surprise\nwas not quite unfeigned. The discovery helped her to find words.\n\n“You said you had started them with the idea of pleasing me--”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“I told you last week that they didn’t please me.”\n\n“Last week? Oh--” He seemed to make an effort of memory. “I thought you\nwere nervous then; you sent for the doctor the next day.”\n\n“It was not the doctor I needed; it was your assurance--”\n\n“My assurance?”\n\nSuddenly she felt the floor fail under her. She sank into the chair with\na choking throat, her words, her reasons slipping away from her like\nstraws down a whirling flood.\n\n“Clement,” she cried, “isn’t it enough for you to know that I hate it?”\n\nHe turned to close the door behind them; then he walked toward her and\nsat down. “What is it that you hate?” he asked gently.\n\nShe had made a desperate effort to rally her routed argument.\n\n“I can’t bear to have you speak as if--as if--our marriage--were like\nthe other kind--the wrong kind. When I heard you there, the other\nafternoon, before all those inquisitive gossiping people, proclaiming\nthat husbands and wives had a right to leave each other whenever they\nwere tired--or had seen some one else--”\n\nWestall sat motionless, his eyes fixed on a pattern of the carpet.\n\n“You HAVE ceased to take this view, then?” he said as she broke\noff. “You no longer believe that husbands and wives ARE justified in\nseparating--under such conditions?”\n\n“Under such conditions?” she stammered. “Yes--I still believe that--but\nhow can we judge for others? What can we know of the circumstances--?”\n\nHe interrupted her. “I thought it was a fundamental article of our\ncreed that the special circumstances produced by marriage were not to\ninterfere with the full assertion of individual liberty.” He paused a\nmoment. “I thought that was your reason for leaving Arment.”\n\nShe flushed to the forehead. It was not like him to give a personal turn\nto the argument.\n\n“It was my reason,” she said simply.\n\n“Well, then--why do you refuse to recognize its validity now?”\n\n“I don’t--I don’t--I only say that one can’t judge for others.”\n\nHe made an impatient movement. “This is mere hair-splitting. What you\nmean is that, the doctrine having served your purpose when you needed\nit, you now repudiate it.”\n\n“Well,” she exclaimed, flushing again, “what if I do? What does it\nmatter to us?”\n\nWestall rose from his chair. He was excessively pale, and stood before\nhis wife with something of the formality of a stranger.\n\n“It matters to me,” he said in a low voice, “because I do NOT repudiate\nit.”\n\n“Well--?”\n\n“And because I had intended to invoke it as”--\n\nHe paused and drew his breath deeply. She sat silent, almost deafened by\nher heart-beats.\n\n--“as a complete justification of the course I am about to take.”\n\nJulia remained motionless. “What course is that?” she asked.\n\nHe cleared his throat. “I mean to claim the fulfilment of your promise.”\n\nFor an instant the room wavered and darkened; then she recovered a\ntorturing acuteness of vision. Every detail of her surroundings pressed\nupon her: the tick of the clock, the slant of sunlight on the wall, the\nhardness of the chair-arms that she grasped, were a separate wound to\neach sense.\n\n“My promise--” she faltered.\n\n“Your part of our mutual agreement to set each other free if one or the\nother should wish to be released.”\n\nShe was silent again. He waited a moment, shifting his position\nnervously; then he said, with a touch of irritability: “You acknowledge\nthe agreement?”\n\nThe question went through her like a shock. She lifted her head to it\nproudly. “I acknowledge the agreement,” she said.\n\n“And--you don’t mean to repudiate it?”\n\nA log on the hearth fell forward, and mechanically he advanced and\npushed it back.\n\n“No,” she answered slowly, “I don’t mean to repudiate it.”\n\nThere was a pause. He remained near the hearth, his elbow resting on the\nmantel-shelf. Close to his hand stood a little cup of jade that he had\ngiven her on one of their wedding anniversaries. She wondered vaguely if\nhe noticed it.\n\n“You intend to leave me, then?” she said at length.\n\nHis gesture seemed to deprecate the crudeness of the allusion.\n\n“To marry some one else?”\n\nAgain his eye and hand protested. She rose and stood before him.\n\n“Why should you be afraid to tell me? Is it Una Van Sideren?”\n\nHe was silent.\n\n“I wish you good luck,” she said.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nShe looked up, finding herself alone. She did not remember when or how\nhe had left the room, or how long afterward she had sat there. The fire\nstill smouldered on the hearth, but the slant of sunlight had left the\nwall.\n\nHer first conscious thought was that she had not broken her word, that\nshe had fulfilled the very letter of their bargain. There had been no\ncrying out, no vain appeal to the past, no attempt at temporizing or\nevasion. She had marched straight up to the guns.\n\nNow that it was over, she sickened to find herself alive. She looked\nabout her, trying to recover her hold on reality. Her identity seemed to\nbe slipping from her, as it disappears in a physical swoon. “This is my\nroom--this is my house,” she heard herself saying. Her room? Her house?\nShe could almost hear the walls laugh back at her.\n\nShe stood up, a dull ache in every bone. The silence of the room\nfrightened her. She remembered, now, having heard the front door close\na long time ago: the sound suddenly re-echoed through her brain. Her\nhusband must have left the house, then--her HUSBAND? She no longer knew\nin what terms to think: the simplest phrases had a poisoned edge. She\nsank back into her chair, overcome by a strange weakness. The clock\nstruck ten--it was only ten o’clock! Suddenly she remembered that\nshe had not ordered dinner... or were they dining out that evening?\nDINNER--DINING OUT--the old meaningless phraseology pursued her! She\nmust try to think of herself as she would think of some one else, a some\none dissociated from all the familiar routine of the past, whose wants\nand habits must gradually be learned, as one might spy out the ways of a\nstrange animal...\n\nThe clock struck another hour--eleven. She stood up again and walked\nto the door: she thought she would go up stairs to her room. HER room?\nAgain the word derided her. She opened the door, crossed the narrow\nhall, and walked up the stairs. As she passed, she noticed Westall’s\nsticks and umbrellas: a pair of his gloves lay on the hall table. The\nsame stair-carpet mounted between the same walls; the same old French\nprint, in its narrow black frame, faced her on the landing. This visual\ncontinuity was intolerable. Within, a gaping chasm; without, the same\nuntroubled and familiar surface. She must get away from it before she\ncould attempt to think. But, once in her room, she sat down on the\nlounge, a stupor creeping over her...\n\nGradually her vision cleared. A great deal had happened in the\ninterval--a wild marching and countermarching of emotions, arguments,\nideas--a fury of insurgent impulses that fell back spent upon\nthemselves. She had tried, at first, to rally, to organize these chaotic\nforces. There must be help somewhere, if only she could master the inner\ntumult. Life could not be broken off short like this, for a whim, a\nfancy; the law itself would side with her, would defend her. The law?\nWhat claim had she upon it? She was the prisoner of her own choice: she\nhad been her own legislator, and she was the predestined victim of\nthe code she had devised. But this was grotesque, intolerable--a mad\nmistake, for which she could not be held accountable! The law she had\ndespised was still there, might still be invoked... invoked, but to what\nend? Could she ask it to chain Westall to her side? SHE had been\nallowed to go free when she claimed her freedom--should she show less\nmagnanimity than she had exacted? Magnanimity? The word lashed her with\nits irony--one does not strike an attitude when one is fighting for\nlife! She would threaten, grovel, cajole... she would yield anything to\nkeep her hold on happiness. Ah, but the difficulty lay deeper! The law\ncould not help her--her own apostasy could not help her. She was the\nvictim of the theories she renounced. It was as though some giant\nmachine of her own making had caught her up in its wheels and was\ngrinding her to atoms...\n\nIt was afternoon when she found herself out-of-doors. She walked with\nan aimless haste, fearing to meet familiar faces. The day was radiant,\nmetallic: one of those searching American days so calculated to\nreveal the shortcomings of our street-cleaning and the excesses of our\narchitecture. The streets looked bare and hideous; everything stared\nand glittered. She called a passing hansom, and gave Mrs. Van Sideren’s\naddress. She did not know what had led up to the act; but she found\nherself suddenly resolved to speak, to cry out a warning. It was too\nlate to save herself--but the girl might still be told. The hansom\nrattled up Fifth Avenue; she sat with her eyes fixed, avoiding\nrecognition. At the Van Siderens’ door she sprang out and rang the bell.\nAction had cleared her brain, and she felt calm and self-possessed. She\nknew now exactly what she meant to say.\n\nThe ladies were both out... the parlor-maid stood waiting for a card.\nJulia, with a vague murmur, turned away from the door and lingered a\nmoment on the sidewalk. Then she remembered that she had not paid the\ncab-driver. She drew a dollar from her purse and handed it to him.\nHe touched his hat and drove off, leaving her alone in the long empty\nstreet. She wandered away westward, toward strange thoroughfares, where\nshe was not likely to meet acquaintances. The feeling of aimlessness had\nreturned. Once she found herself in the afternoon torrent of Broadway,\nswept past tawdry shops and flaming theatrical posters, with a\nsuccession of meaningless faces gliding by in the opposite direction...\n\nA feeling of faintness reminded her that she had not eaten since\nmorning. She turned into a side street of shabby houses, with rows of\nash-barrels behind bent area railings. In a basement window she saw the\nsign LADIES’ RESTAURANT: a pie and a dish of doughnuts lay against the\ndusty pane like petrified food in an ethnological museum. She entered,\nand a young woman with a weak mouth and a brazen eye cleared a table for\nher near the window. The table was covered with a red and white cotton\ncloth and adorned with a bunch of celery in a thick tumbler and a\nsalt-cellar full of grayish lumpy salt. Julia ordered tea, and sat a\nlong time waiting for it. She was glad to be away from the noise and\nconfusion of the streets. The low-ceilinged room was empty, and two or\nthree waitresses with thin pert faces lounged in the background staring\nat her and whispering together. At last the tea was brought in a\ndiscolored metal teapot. Julia poured a cup and drank it hastily. It was\nblack and bitter, but it flowed through her veins like an elixir. She\nwas almost dizzy with exhilaration. Oh, how tired, how unutterably tired\nshe had been!\n\nShe drank a second cup, blacker and bitterer, and now her mind was once\nmore working clearly. She felt as vigorous, as decisive, as when she had\nstood on the Van Siderens’ door-step--but the wish to return there had\nsubsided. She saw now the futility of such an attempt--the humiliation\nto which it might have exposed her... The pity of it was that she did\nnot know what to do next. The short winter day was fading, and she\nrealized that she could not remain much longer in the restaurant without\nattracting notice. She paid for her tea and went out into the street.\nThe lamps were alight, and here and there a basement shop cast an\noblong of gas-light across the fissured pavement. In the dusk there was\nsomething sinister about the aspect of the street, and she hastened back\ntoward Fifth Avenue. She was not used to being out alone at that hour.\n\nAt the corner of Fifth Avenue she paused and stood watching the stream\nof carriages. At last a policeman caught sight of her and signed to her\nthat he would take her across. She had not meant to cross the street,\nbut she obeyed automatically, and presently found herself on the\nfarther corner. There she paused again for a moment; but she fancied the\npoliceman was watching her, and this sent her hastening down the nearest\nside street... After that she walked a long time, vaguely... Night had\nfallen, and now and then, through the windows of a passing carriage, she\ncaught the expanse of an evening waistcoat or the shimmer of an opera\ncloak...\n\nSuddenly she found herself in a familiar street. She stood still a\nmoment, breathing quickly. She had turned the corner without noticing\nwhither it led; but now, a few yards ahead of her, she saw the house\nin which she had once lived--her first husband’s house. The blinds were\ndrawn, and only a faint translucence marked the windows and the transom\nabove the door. As she stood there she heard a step behind her, and a\nman walked by in the direction of the house. He walked slowly, with a\nheavy middle-aged gait, his head sunk a little between the shoulders,\nthe red crease of his neck visible above the fur collar of his overcoat.\nHe crossed the street, went up the steps of the house, drew forth a\nlatch-key, and let himself in...\n\nThere was no one else in sight. Julia leaned for a long time against the\narea-rail at the corner, her eyes fixed on the front of the house. The\nfeeling of physical weariness had returned, but the strong tea still\nthrobbed in her veins and lit her brain with an unnatural clearness.\nPresently she heard another step draw near, and moving quickly away, she\ntoo crossed the street and mounted the steps of the house. The impulse\nwhich had carried her there prolonged itself in a quick pressure of the\nelectric bell--then she felt suddenly weak and tremulous, and grasped\nthe balustrade for support. The door opened and a young footman with\na fresh inexperienced face stood on the threshold. Julia knew in an\ninstant that he would admit her.\n\n“I saw Mr. Arment going in just now,” she said. “Will you ask him to see\nme for a moment?”\n\nThe footman hesitated. “I think Mr. Arment has gone up to dress for\ndinner, madam.”\n\nJulia advanced into the hall. “I am sure he will see me--I will not\ndetain him long,” she said. She spoke quietly, authoritatively, in the\ntone which a good servant does not mistake. The footman had his hand on\nthe drawing-room door.\n\n“I will tell him, madam. What name, please?”\n\nJulia trembled: she had not thought of that. “Merely say a lady,” she\nreturned carelessly.\n\nThe footman wavered and she fancied herself lost; but at that instant\nthe door opened from within and John Arment stepped into the hall. He\ndrew back sharply as he saw her, his florid face turning sallow with\nthe shock; then the blood poured back to it, swelling the veins on his\ntemples and reddening the lobes of his thick ears.\n\nIt was long since Julia had seen him, and she was startled at the change\nin his appearance. He had thickened, coarsened, settled down into\nthe enclosing flesh. But she noted this insensibly: her one conscious\nthought was that, now she was face to face with him, she must not let\nhim escape till he had heard her. Every pulse in her body throbbed with\nthe urgency of her message.\n\nShe went up to him as he drew back. “I must speak to you,” she said.\n\nArment hesitated, red and stammering. Julia glanced at the footman, and\nher look acted as a warning. The instinctive shrinking from a “scene”\n predominated over every other impulse, and Arment said slowly: “Will you\ncome this way?”\n\nHe followed her into the drawing-room and closed the door. Julia, as she\nadvanced, was vaguely aware that the room at least was unchanged: time\nhad not mitigated its horrors. The contadina still lurched from the\nchimney-breast, and the Greek slave obstructed the threshold of the\ninner room. The place was alive with memories: they started out from\nevery fold of the yellow satin curtains and glided between the angles of\nthe rosewood furniture. But while some subordinate agency was carrying\nthese impressions to her brain, her whole conscious effort was centred\nin the act of dominating Arment’s will. The fear that he would refuse\nto hear her mounted like fever to her brain. She felt her purpose melt\nbefore it, words and arguments running into each other in the heat of\nher longing. For a moment her voice failed her, and she imagined herself\nthrust out before she could speak; but as she was struggling for a word,\nArment pushed a chair forward, and said quietly: “You are not well.”\n\nThe sound of his voice steadied her. It was neither kind nor unkind--a\nvoice that suspended judgment, rather, awaiting unforeseen developments.\nShe supported herself against the back of the chair and drew a deep\nbreath. “Shall I send for something?” he continued, with a cold\nembarrassed politeness.\n\nJulia raised an entreating hand. “No--no--thank you. I am quite well.”\n\nHe paused midway toward the bell and turned on her. “Then may I ask--?”\n\n“Yes,” she interrupted him. “I came here because I wanted to see you.\nThere is something I must tell you.”\n\nArment continued to scrutinize her. “I am surprised at that,” he said.\n“I should have supposed that any communication you may wish to make\ncould have been made through our lawyers.”\n\n“Our lawyers!” She burst into a little laugh. “I don’t think they could\nhelp me--this time.”\n\nArment’s face took on a barricaded look. “If there is any question of\nhelp--of course--”\n\nIt struck her, whimsically, that she had seen that look when some shabby\ndevil called with a subscription-book. Perhaps he thought she wanted him\nto put his name down for so much in sympathy--or even in money...\nThe thought made her laugh again. She saw his look change slowly to\nperplexity. All his facial changes were slow, and she remembered,\nsuddenly, how it had once diverted her to shift that lumbering scenery\nwith a word. For the first time it struck her that she had been cruel.\n“There IS a question of help,” she said in a softer key: “you can help\nme; but only by listening... I want to tell you something...”\n\nArment’s resistance was not yielding. “Would it not be easier\nto--write?” he suggested.\n\nShe shook her head. “There is no time to write... and it won’t take\nlong.” She raised her head and their eyes met. “My husband has left me,”\n she said.\n\n“Westall--?” he stammered, reddening again.\n\n“Yes. This morning. Just as I left you. Because he was tired of me.”\n\nThe words, uttered scarcely above a whisper, seemed to dilate to the\nlimit of the room. Arment looked toward the door; then his embarrassed\nglance returned to Julia.\n\n“I am very sorry,” he said awkwardly.\n\n“Thank you,” she murmured.\n\n“But I don’t see--”\n\n“No--but you will--in a moment. Won’t you listen to me? Please!”\n Instinctively she had shifted her position putting herself between\nhim and the door. “It happened this morning,” she went on in short\nbreathless phrases. “I never suspected anything--I thought we\nwere--perfectly happy... Suddenly he told me he was tired of me... there\nis a girl he likes better... He has gone to her...” As she spoke, the\nlurking anguish rose upon her, possessing her once more to the exclusion\nof every other emotion. Her eyes ached, her throat swelled with it, and\ntwo painful tears burnt a way down her face.\n\nArment’s constraint was increasing visibly. “This--this is very\nunfortunate,” he began. “But I should say the law--”\n\n“The law?” she echoed ironically. “When he asks for his freedom?”\n\n“You are not obliged to give it.”\n\n“You were not obliged to give me mine--but you did.”\n\nHe made a protesting gesture.\n\n“You saw that the law couldn’t help you--didn’t you?” she went on.\n“That is what I see now. The law represents material rights--it can’t go\nbeyond. If we don’t recognize an inner law... the obligation that love\ncreates... being loved as well as loving... there is nothing to\nprevent our spreading ruin unhindered... is there?” She raised her head\nplaintively, with the look of a bewildered child. “That is what I see\nnow... what I wanted to tell you. He leaves me because he’s tired... but\nI was not tired; and I don’t understand why he is. That’s the dreadful\npart of it--the not understanding: I hadn’t realized what it meant.\nBut I’ve been thinking of it all day, and things have come back to\nme--things I hadn’t noticed... when you and I...” She moved closer to\nhim, and fixed her eyes on his with the gaze that tries to reach beyond\nwords. “I see now that YOU didn’t understand--did you?”\n\nTheir eyes met in a sudden shock of comprehension: a veil seemed to be\nlifted between them. Arment’s lip trembled.\n\n“No,” he said, “I didn’t understand.”\n\nShe gave a little cry, almost of triumph. “I knew it! I knew it! You\nwondered--you tried to tell me--but no words came... You saw your life\nfalling in ruins... the world slipping from you... and you couldn’t\nspeak or move!”\n\nShe sank down on the chair against which she had been leaning. “Now I\nknow--now I know,” she repeated.\n\n“I am very sorry for you,” she heard Arment stammer.\n\nShe looked up quickly. “That’s not what I came for. I don’t want you to\nbe sorry. I came to ask you to forgive me... for not understanding that\nYOU didn’t understand... That’s all I wanted to say.” She rose with a\nvague sense that the end had come, and put out a groping hand toward the\ndoor.\n\nArment stood motionless. She turned to him with a faint smile.\n\n“You forgive me?”\n\n“There is nothing to forgive--”\n\n“Then will you shake hands for good-by?” She felt his hand in hers: it\nwas nerveless, reluctant.\n\n“Good-by,” she repeated. “I understand now.”\n\nShe opened the door and passed out into the hall. As she did so, Arment\ntook an impulsive step forward; but just then the footman, who was\nevidently alive to his obligations, advanced from the background to let\nher out. She heard Arment fall back. The footman threw open the door,\nand she found herself outside in the darkness.\n\nThe End of The Reckoning\n\n\n\n\n\nVERSE\n\n\n\n\nBOTTICELLI’S MADONNA IN THE LOUVRE.\n\n\n     WHAT strange presentiment, O Mother, lies\n     On thy waste brow and sadly-folded lips,\n     Forefeeling the Light’s terrible eclipse\n     On Calvary, as if love made thee wise,\n     And thou couldst read in those dear infant eyes\n     The sorrow that beneath their smiling sleeps,\n     And guess what bitter tears a mother weeps\n     When the cross darkens her unclouded skies?\n\n     Sad Lady, if some mother, passing thee,\n     Should feel a throb of thy foreboding pain,\n     And think--“My child at home clings so to me,\n     With the same smile... and yet in vain, in vain,\n     Since even this Jesus died on Calvary”--\n     Say to her then: “He also rose again.”\n\n\n\n\nTHE TOMB OF ILARIA GIUNIGI.\n\n\n     ILARIA, thou that wert so fair and dear\n     That death would fain disown thee, grief made wise\n     With prophecy thy husband’s widowed eyes\n     And bade him call the master’s art to rear\n     Thy perfect image on the sculptured bier,\n     With dreaming lids, hands laid in peaceful guise\n     Beneath the breast that seems to fall and rise,\n     And lips that at love’s call should answer, “Here!”\n\n     First-born of the Renascence, when thy soul\n     Cast the sweet robing of the flesh aside,\n     Into these lovelier marble limbs it stole,\n     Regenerate in art’s sunrise clear and wide\n     As saints who, having kept faith’s raiment whole,\n     Change it above for garments glorified.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SONNET.\n\n     PURE form, that like some chalice of old time\n        Contain’st the liquid of the poet’s thought\n        Within thy curving hollow, gem-enwrought\n        With interwoven traceries of rhyme,\n     While o’er thy brim the bubbling fancies climb,\n        What thing am I, that undismayed have sought\n        To pour my verse with trembling hand untaught\n        Into a shape so small yet so sublime?\n     Because perfection haunts the hearts of men,\n        Because thy sacred chalice gathered up\n        The wine of Petrarch, Shakspere, Shelley--then\n     Receive these tears of failure as they drop\n        (Sole vintage of my life), since I am fain\n        To pour them in a consecrated cup.\n\n\n\n\nTWO BACKGROUNDS.\n\n\n     I. LA VIERGE AU DONATEUR.\n\n\n     HERE  by the ample river’s argent sweep,\n     Bosomed in tilth and vintage to her walls,\n     A tower-crowned Cybele in armored sleep\n     The city lies, fat plenty in her halls,\n     With calm, parochial spires that hold in fee\n     The friendly gables clustered at their base,\n     And, equipoised o’er tower and market-place,\n     The Gothic minster’s winged immensity;\n     And in that narrow burgh, with equal mood,\n     Two placid hearts, to all life’s good resigned,\n     Might, from the altar to the lych-gate, find\n     Long years of peace and dreamless plenitude.\n\n\n     II. MONA LISA.\n\n\n     Yon strange blue city crowns a scarped steep\n     No mortal foot hath bloodlessly essayed;\n     Dreams and illusions beacon from its keep,\n     But at the gate an Angel bares his blade;\n     And tales are told of those who thought to gain\n     At dawn its ramparts; but when evening fell\n     Far off they saw each fading pinnacle\n     Lit with wild lightnings from the heaven of pain;\n     Yet there two souls, whom life’s perversities\n     Had mocked with want in plenty, tears in mirth,\n     Might meet in dreams, ungarmented of earth,\n     And drain Joy’s awful chalice to the lees.\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIENCE.\n\n\n     I.\n\n     LIKE Crusoe with the bootless gold we stand\n     Upon the desert verge of death, and say:\n     “What shall avail the woes of yesterday\n     To buy to-morrow’s wisdom, in the land\n     Whose currency is strange unto our hand?\n     In life’s small market they have served to pay\n     Some late-found rapture, could we but delay\n     Till Time hath matched our means to our demand.”\n\n     But otherwise Fate wills it, for, behold,\n     Our gathered strength of individual pain,\n     When Time’s long alchemy hath made it gold,\n     Dies with us--hoarded all these years in vain,\n     Since those that might be heir to it the mould\n     Renew, and coin themselves new griefs again.\n\n\n     II.\n\n     O, Death, we come full-handed to thy gate,\n     Rich with strange burden of the mingled years,\n     Gains and renunciations, mirth and tears,\n     And love’s oblivion, and remembering hate,\n     Nor know we what compulsion laid such freight\n     Upon our souls--and shall our hopes and fears\n     Buy nothing of thee, Death?  Behold our wares,\n     And sell us the one joy for which we wait.\n     Had we lived longer, life had such for sale,\n     With the last coin of sorrow purchased cheap,\n     But now we stand before thy shadowy pale,\n     And all our longings lie within thy keep--\n     Death, can it be the years shall naught avail?\n\n     “Not so,” Death answered, “they shall purchase sleep.”\n\n\n\n\nCHARTRES.\n\n\n     I.\n\n     IMMENSE, august, like some Titanic bloom,\n        The mighty choir unfolds its lithic core,\n     Petalled with panes of azure, gules and or,\n        Splendidly lambent in the Gothic gloom,\n     And stamened with keen flamelets that illume\n        The pale high-altar.  On the prayer-worn floor,\n     By surging worshippers thick-thronged of yore,\n        A few brown crones, familiars of the tomb,\n     The stranded driftwood of Faith’s ebbing sea--\n        For these alone the finials fret the skies,\n     The topmost bosses shake their blossoms free,\n        While from the triple portals, with grave eyes,\n     Tranquil, and fixed upon eternity,\n        The cloud of witnesses still testifies.\n\n\n     II.\n\n     The crimson panes like blood-drops stigmatize\n        The western floor.  The aisles are mute and cold.\n     A rigid fetich in her robe of gold\n        The Virgin of the Pillar, with blank eyes,\n     Enthroned beneath her votive canopies,\n        Gathers a meagre remnant to her fold.\n     The rest is solitude; the church, grown old,\n        Stands stark and gray beneath the burning skies.\n     Wellnigh again its mighty frame-work grows\n        To be a part of nature’s self, withdrawn\n     From hot humanity’s impatient woes;\n        The floor is ridged like some rude mountain lawn,\n     And in the east one giant window shows\n        The roseate coldness of an Alp at dawn.\n\n\n\n\nLIFE.\n\n\n     LIFE, like a marble block, is given to all,\n     A blank, inchoate mass of years and days,\n     Whence one with ardent chisel swift essays\n     Some shape of strength or symmetry to call;\n     One shatters it in bits to mend a wall;\n     One in a craftier hand the chisel lays,\n     And one, to wake the mirth in Lesbia’s gaze,\n     Carves it apace in toys fantastical.\n\n     But least is he who, with enchanted eyes\n     Filled with high visions of fair shapes to be,\n     Muses which god he shall immortalize\n     In the proud Parian’s perpetuity,\n     Till twilight warns him from the punctual skies\n     That the night cometh wherein none shall see.\n\n\n\n\nAN AUTUMN SUNSET\n\n\n     I\n\n     LEAGUERED in fire\n     The wild black promontories of the coast extend\n     Their savage silhouettes;\n     The sun in universal carnage sets,\n     And, halting higher,\n     The motionless storm-clouds mass their sullen threats,\n     Like an advancing mob in sword-points penned,\n     That, balked, yet stands at bay.\n     Mid-zenith hangs the fascinated day\n     In wind-lustrated hollows crystalline,\n     A wan valkyrie whose wide pinions shine\n     Across the ensanguined ruins of the fray,\n     And in her lifted hand swings high o’erhead,\n     Above the waste of war,\n     The silver torch-light of the evening star\n     Wherewith to search the faces of the dead.\n\n\n     II\n\n     Lagooned in gold,\n     Seem not those jetty promontories rather\n     The outposts of some ancient land forlorn,\n     Uncomforted of morn,\n     Where old oblivions gather,\n     The melancholy, unconsoling fold\n     Of all things that go utterly to death\n     And mix no more, no more\n     With life’s perpetually awakening breath?\n     Shall Time not ferry me to such a shore,\n     Over such sailless seas,\n     To walk with hope’s slain importunities\n     In miserable marriage?  Nay, shall not\n     All things be there forgot,\n     Save the sea’s golden barrier and the black\n     Closecrouching promontories?\n     Dead to all shames, forgotten of all glories,\n     Shall I not wander there, a shadow’s shade,\n     A spectre self-destroyed,\n     So purged of all remembrance and sucked back\n     Into the primal void,\n     That should we on that shore phantasmal meet\n     I should not know the coming of your feet?",
