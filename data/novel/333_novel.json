There was no\nidler question, none more hopelessly impossible and unprofitable to\nanswer.  It is one of the many vanities of criticism to promise\nimmortality to the authors that it praises, to patronise a writer with\nthe assurance that our great-grandchildren, whose time and tastes are\nthus frivolously mortgaged, will read his works with delight.  But 'there\nis no antidote against the opium of time, which temporally considereth\nall things: our fathers find their graves in our short memories, and\nsadly tell us how we may be buried in our survivors.'  Let us make sure\nthat our sons will care for Homer before we pledge a more distant\ngeneration to a newer cult.\n\nNevertheless, without handling the prickly question of literary\nimmortality, it is easy to recognise that the literary reputation of\nRobert Louis Stevenson is made of good stuff.  His fame has spread, as\nlasting fame is wont to do, from the few to the many.  Fifteen years ago\nhis essays and fanciful books of travel were treasured by a small and\ndiscerning company of admirers; long before he chanced to fell the\nBritish public with _Treasure Island_ and _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ he\nhad shown himself a delicate marksman.  And although large editions are\nnothing, standard editions, richly furnished and complete, are worthy of\nremark.  Stevenson is one of the very few authors in our literary history\nwho have been honoured during their lifetime by the appearance of such an\nedition; the best of his public, it would seem, do not only wish to read\nhis works, but to possess them, and all of them, at the cost of many\npounds, in library form.  It would be easy to mention more voluminous and\nmore popular authors than Stevenson whose publishers could not find five\nsubscribers for an adventure like this.  He has made a brave beginning in\nthat race against Time which all must lose.\n\nIt is not in the least necessary, after all, to fortify ourselves with\nthe presumed consent of our poor descendants, who may have a world of\nother business to attend to, in order to establish Stevenson in the\nposition of a great writer.  Let us leave that foolish trick to the\npoliticians, who never claim that they are right--merely that they will\nwin at the next elections.  Literary criticism has standards other than\nthe suffrage; it is possible enough to say something of the literary\nquality of a work that appeared yesterday.  Stevenson himself was\nsingularly free from the vanity of fame; 'the best artist,' he says\ntruly, 'is not the man who fixes his eye on posterity, but the one who\nloves the practice of his art.'  He loved, if ever man did, the practice\nof his art; and those who find meat and drink in the delight of watching\nand appreciating the skilful practice of the literary art, will abandon\nthemselves to the enjoyment of his masterstrokes without teasing their\nunborn and possibly illiterate posterity to answer solemn questions.  Will\na book live?  Will a cricket match live?  Perhaps not, and yet both be\nfine achievements.\n\nIt is not easy to estimate the loss to letters by his early death.  In\nthe dedication of _Prince Otto_ he says, 'Well, we will not give in that\nwe are finally beaten. . . . I still mean to get my health again; I still\npurpose, by hook or crook, this book or the next, to launch a\nmasterpiece.'  It would be a churlish or a very dainty critic who should\ndeny that he has launched masterpieces, but whether he ever launched his\nmasterpiece is an open question.  Of the story that he was writing just\nbefore his death he is reported to have said that 'the goodness of it\nfrightened him.'  A goodness that frightened him will surely not be\nvisible, like Banquo's ghost, to only one pair of eyes.  His greatest was\nperhaps yet to come.  Had Dryden died at his age, we should have had none\nof the great satires; had Scott died at his age, we should have had no\nWaverley Novels.  Dying at the height of his power, and in the full tide\nof thought and activity, he seems almost to have fulfilled the aspiration\nand unconscious prophecy of one of the early essays:\n\n   'Does not life go down with a better grace foaming in full body over a\n   precipice, than miserably straggling to an end in sandy deltas?\n\n   'When the Greeks made their fine saying that those whom the gods love\n   die young, I cannot help believing that they had this sort of death\n   also in their eye.  For surely, at whatever age it overtake the man,\n   this is to die young.  Death has not been suffered to take so much as\n   an illusion from his heart.  In the hot-fit of life, a-tiptoe on the\n   highest point of being, he passes at a bound on to the other side.  The\n   noise of the mallet and chisel is scarcely quenched, the trumpets are\n   hardly done blowing, when, trailing with him clouds of glory, this\n   happy starred, full-blooded spirit shoots into the spiritual land.'\n\nBut we on this side are the poorer--by how much we can never know.  What\nstrengthens the conviction that he might yet have surpassed himself and\ndwarfed his own best work is, certainly no immaturity, for the flavour of\nwisdom and old experience hangs about his earliest writings, but a vague\nsense awakened by that brilliant series of books, so diverse in theme, so\nslight often in structure and occasions so gaily executed, that here was\na finished literary craftsman, who had served his period of\napprenticeship and was playing with his tools.  The pleasure of wielding\nthe graven tool, the itch of craftsmanship, was strong upon him, and many\nof the works he has left are the overflow of a laughing energy,\narabesques carved on the rock in the artist's painless hours.\n\nAll art, it is true, is play of a sort; the 'sport-impulse' (to translate\na German phrase) is deep at the root of the artist's power; Sophocles,\nShakespeare, Moliere, and Goethe, in a very profound sense, make game of\nlife.  But to make game of life was to each of these the very loftiest\nand most imperative employ to be found for him on this planet; to hold\nthe mirror up to Nature so that for the first time she may see herself;\nto 'be a candle-holder and look on' at the pageantry which, but for the\ncandle-holder, would huddle along in the undistinguishable blackness,\nfilled them with the pride of place.  Stevenson had the sport-impulse at\nthe depths of his nature, but he also had, perhaps he had inherited, an\ninstinct for work in more blockish material, for lighthouse-building and\niron-founding.  In a 'Letter to a Young Artist,' contributed to a\nmagazine years ago, he compares the artist in paint or in words to the\nkeeper of a booth at the world's fair, dependent for his bread on his\nsuccess in amusing others.  In his volume of poems he almost apologises\nfor his excellence in literature:\n\n   'Say not of me, that weakly I declined\n   The labours of my sires, and fled the sea,\n   The towers we founded, and the lamps we lit,\n   To play at home with paper like a child;\n   But rather say: _In the afternoon of time_\n   _A strenuous family dusted from its hands_\n   _The sand of granite_, _and beholding far_\n   _Along the sounding coasts its pyramids_\n   _And tall memorials catch the dying sun_,\n   _Smiled well-content_, _and to this childish task_\n   _Around the fire addressed its evening hours_.'\n\nSome of his works are, no doubt, best described as paper-games.  In _The\nWrong Box_, for instance, there is something very like the card-game\ncommonly called 'Old Maid'; the odd card is a superfluous corpse, and\neach dismayed recipient in turn assumes a disguise and a pseudonym and\nbravely passes on that uncomfortable inheritance.  It is an admirable\nfarce, hardly touched with grimness, unshaken by the breath of reality,\nfull of fantastic character; the strange funeral procession is attended\nby shouts of glee at each of its stages, and finally melts into space.\n\nBut, when all is said, it is not with work of this kind that Olympus is\nstormed; art must be brought closer into relation with life, these airy\nand delightful freaks of fancy must be subdued to a serious scheme if\nthey are to serve as credentials for a seat among the immortals.  The\ndecorative painter, whose pencil runs so freely in limning these half-\nhuman processions of outlined fauns and wood-nymphs, is asked at last to\npaint an easel picture.\n\nStevenson is best where he shows most restraint, and his peculiarly rich\nfancy, which ran riot at the suggestion of every passing whim, gave him,\nwhat many a modern writer sadly lacks, plenty to restrain, an exuberant\nfield for self-denial.  Here was an opportunity for art and labour; the\nluxuriance of the virgin forests of the West may be clipped and pruned\nfor a lifetime with no fear of reducing them to the trim similitude of a\nDutch garden.  His bountiful and generous nature could profit by a spell\nof training that would emaciate a poorer stock.  From the first, his\ndelight in earth and the earth-born was keen and multiform; his zest in\nlife\n\n      'put a spirit of youth in everything,\n   That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him;'\n\nand his fancy, light and quick as a child's, made of the world around him\nan enchanted pleasance.  The realism, as it is called, that deals only\nwith the banalities and squalors of life, and weaves into the mesh of its\nstory no character but would make you yawn if you passed ten minutes with\nhim in a railway-carriage, might well take a lesson from this man, if it\nhad the brains.  Picture to yourself (it is not hard) an average suburb\nof London.  The long rows of identical bilious brick houses, with the\ninevitable lace curtains, a symbol merely of the will and power to wash;\nthe awful nondescript object, generally under glass, in the front\nwindow--the shrine of the unknown god of art; the sombre invariable\ncitizen, whose garb gives no suggestion of his occupation or his tastes--a\nperson, it would seem, only by courtesy; the piano-organ the music of the\nday, and the hideous voice of the vendor of half-penny papers the music\nof the night; could anything be less promising than such a row of houses\nfor the theatre of romance?  Set a realist to walk down one of these\nstreets: he will inquire about milk-bills and servants' wages, latch-keys\nand Sunday avocations, and come back with a tale of small meannesses and\npetty respectabilities, written in the approved modern fashion.  Yet\nStevenson, it seems likely, could not pass along such a line of brick\nbandboxes without having his pulses set a-throbbing by the imaginative\npossibilities of the place.  Of his own Lieutenant Brackenbury Rich he\nsays:\n\n   'The succession of faces in the lamplight stirred the lieutenant's\n   imagination; and it seemed to him as if he could walk for ever in that\n   stimulating city atmosphere and surrounded by the mystery of four\n   million private lives.  He glanced at the houses and marvelled what\n   was passing behind those warmly lighted windows; he looked into face\n   after face, and saw them each intent upon some unknown interest,\n   criminal or kindly.'\n\nIt was that same evening that Prince Florizel's friend, under the name of\nMr. Morris, was giving a party in one of the houses of West Kensington.\nIn one at least of the houses of that brick wilderness human spirits were\nbeing tested as on an anvil, and most of them tossed aside.  So also, in,\n_The Rajah's Diamond_, it was a quiet suburban garden that witnessed the\nsudden apparition of Mr. Harry Hartley and his treasures precipitated\nover the wall; it was in the same garden that the Rev. Simon Rolles\nsuddenly, to his own surprise, became a thief.  A monotony of bad\nbuilding is no doubt a bad thing, but it cannot paralyse the activities\nor frustrate the agonies of the mind of man.\n\nTo a man with Stevenson's live and searching imagination, every work of\nhuman hands became vocal with possible associations.  Buildings\npositively chattered to him; the little inn at Queensferry, which even\nfor Scott had meant only mutton and currant jelly, with cranberries 'vera\nweel preserved,' gave him the cardinal incident of _Kidnapped_.  How\nshould the world ever seem dull or sordid to one whom a railway-station\nwould take into its confidence, to whom the very flagstones of the\npavement told their story, in whose mind 'the effect of night, of any\nflowing water, of lighted cities, of the peep of day, of ships, of the\nopen ocean,' called up 'an army of anonymous desires and pleasures'?  To\nhave the 'golden-tongued Romance with serene lute' for a mistress and\nfamiliar is to be fortified against the assaults of tedium.\n\nHis attitude towards the surprising and momentous gifts of life was one\nprolonged passion of praise and joy.  There is none of his books that\nreads like the meditations of an invalid.  He has the readiest sympathy\nfor all exhibitions of impulsive energy; his heart goes out to a sailor,\nand leaps into ecstasy over a generous adventurer or buccaneer.  Of one\nof his earlier books he says: 'From the negative point of view I flatter\nmyself this volume has a certain stamp.  Although it runs to considerably\nupwards of two hundred pages, it contains not a single reference to the\nimbecility of God's universe, nor so much as a single hint that I could\nhave made a better one myself.'  And this was an omission that he never\nremedied in his later works.  Indeed, his zest in life, whether lived in\nthe back gardens of a town or on the high seas, was so great that it\nseems probable the writer would have been lost had the man been dowered\nwith better health.\n\n   'Whereas my birth and spirit rather took\n      The way that takes the town,\n   Thou didst betray me to a ling'ring book,\n      And wrap me in a gown,'\n\nsays George Herbert, who, in his earlier ambitions, would fain have\nruffled it with the best at the court of King James.  But from Stevenson,\nalthough not only the town, but oceans and continents, beckoned him to\ndeeds, no such wail escaped.  His indomitable cheerfulness was never\nembarked in the cock-boat of his own prosperity.  A high and simple\ncourage shines through all his writings.  It is supposed to be a normal\nhuman feeling for those who are hale to sympathize with others who are in\npain.  Stevenson reversed the position, and there is no braver spectacle\nin literature than to see him not asking others to lower their voices in\nhis sick-room, but raising his own voice that he may make them feel at\nease and avoid imposing his misfortunes on their notice.  'Once when I\nwas groaning aloud with physical pain,' he says in the essay on _Child's\nPlay_, 'a young gentleman came into the room and nonchalantly inquired if\nI had seen his bow and arrow.  He made no account of my groans, which he\naccepted, as he had to accept so much else, as a piece of the\ninexplicable conduct of his elders; and, like a wise young gentleman, he\nwould waste no wonder on the subject.'  Was there ever a passage like\nthis?  The sympathy of the writer is wholly with the child, and the\nchild's absolute indifference to his own sufferings.  It might have been\nsafely predicted that this man, should he ever attain to pathos, would be\nfree from the facile, maudlin pathos of the hired sentimentalist.\n\nAnd so also with what Dr. Johnson has called 'metaphysical distresses.'\nIt is striking enough to observe how differently the quiet monasteries of\nthe Carthusian and Trappist brotherhoods affected Matthew Arnold and\nRobert Louis Stevenson.  In his well-known elegiac stanzas Matthew Arnold\nlikens his own state to that of the monks:\n\n   'Wandering between two worlds, one dead,\n   The other powerless to be born,\n   With nowhere yet to rest my head,\n   Like these on earth I wait forlorn.\n   Their faith, my tears, the world deride--\n   I come to shed them at their side.'\n\nTo Stevenson, on the other hand, our Lady of the Snows is a mistaken\ndivinity, and the place a monument of chilly error,--for once in a way he\ntakes it on himself to be a preacher, his temperament gives voice in a\ncreed:\n\n   'And ye, O brethren, what if God,\n   When from Heaven's top He spies abroad,\n   And sees on this tormented stage\n   The noble war of mankind rage,\n   What if His vivifying eye,\n   O monks, should pass your corner by?\n   For still the Lord is Lord of might;\n   In deeds, in deeds, He takes delight;\n   The plough, the spear, the laden barks,\n   The field, the founded city, marks;\n   He marks the smiler of the streets,\n   The singer upon garden seats;\n   He sees the climber in the rocks;\n   To Him, the shepherd folds his flocks;\n   For those He loves that underprop\n   With daily virtues Heaven's top,\n   And bear the falling sky with ease,\n   Unfrowning Caryatides.\n   Those He approves that ply the trade,\n   That rock the child, that wed the maid,\n   That with weak virtues, weaker hands,\n   Sow gladness on the peopled lands,\n   And still with laughter, song, and shout\n   Spin the great wheel of earth about.\n\n   But ye?--O ye who linger still\n   Here in your fortress on the hill,\n   With placid face, with tranquil breath,\n   The unsought volunteers of death,\n   Our cheerful General on high\n   With careless looks may pass you by!'\n\nAnd the fact of death, which has damped and darkened the writings of so\nmany minor poets, does not cast a pallor on his conviction.  Life is of\nvalue only because it can be spent, or given; and the love of God coveted\nthe position, and assumed mortality.  If a man treasure and hug his life,\none thing only is certain, that he will be robbed some day, and cut the\npitiable and futile figure of one who has been saving candle-ends in a\nhouse that is on fire.  Better than this to have a foolish spendthrift\nblaze and the loving cup going round.  Stevenson speaks almost with a\npersonal envy of the conduct of the four marines of the _Wager_.  There\nwas no room for them in the boat, and they were left on a desert island\nto a certain death.  'They were soldiers, they said, and knew well enough\nit was their business to die; and as their comrades pulled away, they\nstood upon the beach, gave three cheers, and cried, \"God bless the King!\"\nNow, one or two of those who were in the boat escaped, against all\nlikelihood, to tell the story.  That was a great thing for us'--even when\nlife is extorted it may be given nobly, with ceremony and courtesy.  So\nstrong was Stevenson's admiration for heroic graces like these that in\nthe requiem that appears in his poems he speaks of an ordinary death as\nof a hearty exploit, and draws his figures from lives of adventure and\ntoil:\n\n   'Under the wide and starry sky\n   Dig the grave and let me lie.\n   Glad did I live and gladly die,\n      And I laid me down with a will.\n   This be the verse you grave for me:\n   _Here he lies where he longed to be_,\n   _Home is the sailor_, _home from the sea_,\n      _And the hunter home from the hill_.'\n\nThis man should surely have been honoured with the pomp and colour and\nmusic of a soldier's funeral.\n\nThe most remarkable feature of the work he has left is its singular\ncombination of style and romance.  It has so happened, and the accident\nhas gained almost the strength of a tradition, that the most assiduous\nfollowers of romance have been careless stylists.  They have trusted to\nthe efficacy of their situation and incident, and have too often cared\nlittle about the manner of its presentation.  By an odd piece of irony\nstyle has been left to the cultivation of those who have little or\nnothing to tell.  Sir Walter Scott himself, with all his splendid\nromantic and tragic gifts, often, in Stevenson's perfectly just phrase,\n'fobs us off with languid and inarticulate twaddle.'  He wrote carelessly\nand genially, and then breakfasted, and began the business of the day.\nBut Stevenson, who had romance tingling in every vein of his body, set\nhimself laboriously and patiently to train his other faculty, the faculty\nof style.\n\nI.  STYLE.--Let no one say that 'reading and writing comes by nature,'\nunless he is prepared to be classed with the foolish burgess who said it\nfirst.  A poet is born, not made,--so is every man,--but he is born raw.\nStevenson's life was a grave devotion to the education of himself in the\nart of writing,\n\n   'The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne,\n   Thassay so hard, so sharp the conquering.'\n\nThose who deny the necessity, or decry the utility, of such an education,\nare generally deficient in a sense of what makes good literature--they\nare 'word-deaf,' as others are colour-blind.  All writing is a kind of\nword-weaving; a skilful writer will make a splendid tissue out of the\ndiverse fibres of words.  But to care for words, to select them\njudiciously and lovingly, is not in the least essential to all writing,\nall speaking; for the sad fact is this, that most of us do our thinking,\nour writing, and our speaking in phrases, not in words.  The work of a\nfeeble writer is always a patchwork of phrases, some of them borrowed\nfrom the imperial texture of Shakespeare and Milton, others picked up\nfrom the rags in the street.  We make our very kettle-holders of pieces\nof a king's carpet.  How many overworn quotations from Shakespeare\nsuddenly leap into meaning and brightness when they are seen in their\ncontext!  'The cry is still, \"They come!\"'--'More honoured in the breach\nthan the observance,'--the sight of these phrases in the splendour of\ntheir dramatic context in _Macbeth_ and _Hamlet_ casts shame upon their\ndaily degraded employments.  But the man of affairs has neither the time\nto fashion his speech, nor the knowledge to choose his words, so he\nborrows his sentences ready-made, and applies them in rough haste to\npurposes that they do not exactly fit.  Such a man inevitably repeats,\nlike the cuckoo, monotonous catchwords, and lays his eggs of thought in\nthe material that has been woven into consistency by others.  It is a\nmatter of natural taste, developed and strengthened by continual\npractice, to avoid being the unwitting slave of phrases.\n\nThe artist in words, on the other hand, although he is a lover of fine\nphrases, in his word-weaving experiments uses no shoddy, but cultivates\nhis senses of touch and sight until he can combine the raw fibres in\nnovel and bewitching patterns.  To this end he must have two things: a\nfine sense, in the first place, of the sound, value, meaning, and\nassociations of individual words, and next, a sense of harmony,\nproportion, and effect in their combination.  It is amazing what nobility\na mere truism is often found to possess when it is clad with a garment\nthus woven.\n\nStevenson had both these sensitive capabilities in a very high decree.\nHis careful choice of epithet and name have even been criticised as\nlending to some of his narrative-writing an excessive air of\ndeliberation.  His daintiness of diction is best seen in his earlier\nwork; thereafter his writing became more vigorous and direct, fitter for\nits later uses, but never unillumined by felicities that cause a thrill\nof pleasure to the reader.  Of the value of words he had the acutest\nappreciation.  _Virginibus Puerisque_, his first book of essays, is\ncrowded with happy hits and subtle implications conveyed in a single\nword.  'We have all heard,' he says in one of these, 'of cities in South\nAmerica built upon the side of fiery mountains, and how, even in this\ntremendous neighbourhood, the inhabitants are not a jot more impressed by\nthe solemnity of mortal conditions than if they were delving gardens in\nthe greenest corner of England.'  You can feel the ground shake and see\nthe volcano tower above you at that word '_tremendous_ neighbourhood.'\nSomething of the same double reference to the original and acquired\nmeanings of a word is to be found in such a phrase as 'sedate\nelectrician,' for one who in a back office wields all the lights of a\ncity; or in that description of one drawing near to death, who is spoken\nof as groping already with his hands 'on the face of the _impassable_.'\n\nThe likeness of this last word to a very different word, '_impassive_,'\nis made to do good literary service in suggesting the sphinx-like image\nof death.  Sometimes, as here, this subtle sense of double meanings\nalmost leads to punning.  In _Across the Plains_ Stevenson narrates how a\nbet was transacted at a railway-station, and subsequently, he supposes,\n'_liquidated_ at the bar.'  This is perhaps an instance of the excess of\na virtue, but it is an excess to be found plentifully in the works of\nMilton.\n\nHis loving regard for words bears good fruit in his later and more\nstirring works.  He has a quick ear and appreciation for live phrases on\nthe lips of tramps, beach-combers, or Americans.  In _The Beach of\nFalesa_ the sea-captain who introduces the new trader to the South\nPacific island where the scene of the story is laid, gives a brief\ndescription of the fate of the last dealer in copra.  It may serve as a\nsingle illustration of volumes of racy, humorous, and imaginative slang;\n\n   '\"Do you catch a bit of white there to the east'ard?\" the captain\n   continued.  \"That's your house. . . . When old Adams saw it, he took\n   and shook me by the hand.  'I've dropped into a soft thing here,' says\n   he.  'So you have,' says I. . . . Poor Johnny!  I never saw him again\n   but the once . . . and the next time we came round there he was dead\n   and buried.  I took and put up a bit of stick to him: 'John Adams,\n   _obit_ eighteen and sixty-eight.  Go thou and do likewise.'  I missed\n   that man.  I never could see much harm in Johnny.\"\n\n   '\"What did he die of?\" I inquired.\n\n   '\"Some kind of sickness,\" says the captain.  \"It appears it took him\n   sudden.  Seems he got up in the night, and filled up on Pain-Killer\n   and Kennedy's Discovery.  No go--he was booked beyond Kennedy.  Then\n   he had tried to open a case of gin.  No go again: not strong enough. .\n   . . Poor John!\"'\n\nThere is a world of abrupt, homely talk like this to be found in the\nspeech of Captain Nares and of Jim Pinkerton in _The Wrecker_; and a\nwealth of Scottish dialect, similar in effect, in _Kidnapped_,\n_Catriona_, and many other stories.  It was a delicate ear and a sense\ntrained by practice that picked up these vivid turns of speech, some of\nthem perhaps heard only once, and a mind given to dwell on words, that\nremembered them for years, and brought them out when occasion arose.\n\nBut the praise of Stevenson's style cannot be exhausted in a description\nof his use of individual words or his memory of individual phrases.  His\nmastery of syntax, the orderly and emphatic arrangement of words in\nsentences, a branch of art so seldom mastered, was even greater.  And\nhere he could owe no great debt to his romantic predecessors in prose.\nDumas, it is true, is a master of narrative, but he wrote in French, and\na style will hardly bear expatriation.  Scott's sentences are, many of\nthem, shambling, knock-kneed giants.  Stevenson harked further back for\nhis models, and fed his style on the most vigorous of the prose writers\nof the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the golden age of\nEnglish prose.  'What English those fellows wrote!' says Fitzgerald in\none of his letters; 'I cannot read the modern mechanique after them.'  And\nhe quotes a passage from Harrington's _Oceana_:\n\n   'This free-born Nation lives not upon the dole or Bounty of One Man,\n   but distributing her Annual Magistracies and Honours with her own\n   hand, is herself King People.'\n\nIt was from writers of Harrington's time and later that Stevenson learned\nsomething of his craft.  Bunyan and Defoe should be particularly\nmentioned, and that later excellent worthy, Captain Charles Johnson, who\ncompiled the ever-memorable _Lives of Pirates and Highwaymen_.  Mr.\nGeorge Meredith is the chief of those very few modern writers whose\ninfluence may be detected in his style.\n\nHowever it was made, and whencesoever the material or suggestion\nborrowed, he came by a very admirable instrument for the telling of\nstories.  Those touches of archaism that are so frequent with him, the\nslightly unusual phrasing, or unexpected inversion of the order of words,\nshow a mind alert in its expression, and give the sting of novelty even\nto the commonplaces of narrative or conversation.  A nimble literary tact\nwill work its will on the phrases of current small-talk, remoulding them\nnearer to the heart's desire, transforming them to its own stamp.  This\nwas what Stevenson did, and the very conversations that pass between his\ncharacters have an air of distinction that is all his own.  His books are\nfull of brilliant talk--talk real and convincing enough in its purport\nand setting, but purged of the languors and fatuities of actual\ncommonplace conversation.  It is an enjoyment like that to be obtained\nfrom a brilliant exhibition of fencing, clean and dexterous, to assist at\nthe talking bouts of David Balfour and Miss Grant, Captain Nares and Mr.\nDodd, Alexander Mackellar and the Master of Ballantrae, Prince Otto and\nSir John Crabtree, or those wholly admirable pieces of special pleading\nto be found in _A Lodging for the Night_ and _The Sire de Maletroit's\nDoor_.  But people do not talk like this in actual life--''tis true, 'tis\npity; and pity 'tis, 'tis true.'  They do not; in actual life\nconversation is generally so smeared and blurred with stupidities, so\ninvaded and dominated by the spirit of dulness, so liable to swoon into\nmeaninglessness, that to turn to Stevenson's books is like an escape into\nmountain air from the stagnant vapours of a morass.  The exact\nreproduction of conversation as it occurs in life can only be undertaken\nby one whose natural dulness feels itself incommoded by wit and fancy as\nby a grit in the eye.  Conversation is often no more than a nervous habit\nof body, like twiddling the thumbs, and to record each particular remark\nis as much as to describe each particular twiddle.  Or in its more\nintellectual uses, when speech is employed, for instance, to conceal our\nthoughts, how often is it a world too wide for the shrunken nudity of the\nthought it is meant to veil, and thrown over it, formless, flabby, and\nblack--like a tarpaulin!  It is pleasant to see thought and feeling\ndressed for once in the trim, bright raiment Stevenson devises for them.\n\nThere is an indescribable air of distinction, which is, and is not, one\nand the same thing with style, breathing from all his works.  Even when\nhe is least inspired, his bearing and gait could never be mistaken for\nanother man's.  All that he writes is removed by the width of the spheres\nfrom the possibility of commonplace, and he avoids most of the snares and\npitfalls of genius with noble and unconscious skill.\n\nIf he ever fell into one of these--which may perhaps be doubted--it was\nthrough too implicit a confidence in the powers of style.  His open\nletter to the Rev. Dr. Hyde in vindication of Father Damien is perhaps\nhis only literary mistake.  It is a matchless piece of scorn and\ninvective, not inferior in skill to anything he ever wrote.  But that it\nwas well done is no proof that it should have been done at all.  'I\nremember Uzzah and am afraid,' said the wise Erasmus, when he was urged\nto undertake the defence of Holy Church; 'it is not every one who is\npermitted to support the Ark of the Covenant.'  And the only disquietude\nsuggested by Stevenson's letter is a doubt whether he really has a claim\nto be Father Damien's defender, whether Father Damien had need of the\nassistance of a literary freelance.  The Saint who was bitten in the hand\nby a serpent shook it off into the fire and stood unharmed.  As it was in\nthe Mediterranean so it was also in the Pacific, and there is something\nofficious in the intrusion of a spectator, something irrelevant in the\nplentiful pronouns of the first person singular to be found sprinkled\nover Stevenson's letter.  The curse spoken in Eden, 'Upon thy belly shalt\nthou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life,' surely\ncovered by anticipation the case of the Rev. Dr. Hyde.\n\nII.  ROMANCE.--The faculty of romance, the greatest of the gifts showered\non Stevenson's cradle by the fairies, will suffer no course of\ndevelopment; the most that can be done with it is to preserve it on from\nchildhood unblemished and undiminished.  It is of a piece with\nStevenson's romantic ability that his own childhood never ended; he could\npass back into that airy world without an effort.  In his stories his\nimagination worked on the old lines, but it became conscious of its\nworking.  And the highest note of these stories is not drama, nor\ncharacter, but romance.  In one of his essays he defines the highest\nachievement of romance to be the embodiment of 'character, thought, or\nemotion in some act or attitude that shall be remarkably striking to the\nmind's eye.'  His essay on Victor Hugo shows how keenly conscious he was\nthat narrative romance can catch and embody emotions and effects that are\nfor ever out of the reach of the drama proper, and of the essay or\nhomily, just as they are out of the reach of sculpture and painting.  Now,\nit is precisely in these effects that the chief excellence of romance\nresides; it was the discovery of a world of these effects, insusceptible\nof treatment by the drama, neglected entirely by the character-novel,\nwhich constituted the Romantic revival of the end of last century.  'The\nartistic result of a romance,' says Stevenson, 'what is left upon the\nmemory by any powerful and artistic novel, is something so complicated\nand refined that it is difficult to put a name upon it, and yet something\nas simple as nature. . . .  The fact is, that art is working far ahead of\nlanguage as well as of science, realizing for us, by all manner of\nsuggestions and exaggerations, effects for which as yet we have no direct\nname, for the reason that these effects do not enter very largely into\nthe necessities of life.  Hence alone is that suspicion of vagueness that\noften hangs about the purpose of a romance; it is clear enough to us in\nthought, but we are not used to consider anything clear until we are able\nto formulate it in words, and analytical language has not been\nsufficiently shaped to that end.'  He goes on to point out that there is\nan epical value about every great romance, an underlying idea, not\npresentable always in abstract or critical terms, in the stories of such\nmasters of pure romance as Victor Hugo and Nathaniel Hawthorne.\n\nThe progress of romance in the present century has consisted chiefly in\nthe discovery of new exercises of imagination and new subtle effects in\nstory.  Fielding, as Stevenson says, did not understand that the nature\nof a landscape or the spirit of the times could count for anything in a\nstory; all his actions consist of a few simple personal elements.  With\nScott vague influences that qualify a man's personality begin to make a\nlarge claim; 'the individual characters begin to occupy a comparatively\nsmall proportion of that canvas on which armies manoeuvre and great hills\npile themselves upon each other's shoulders.'  And the achievements of\nthe great masters since Scott--Hugo, Dumas, Hawthorne, to name only those\nin Stevenson's direct line of ancestry--have added new realms to the\ndomain of romance.\n\nWhat are the indescribable effects that romance, casting far beyond\nproblems of character and conduct, seeks to realise?  What is the nature\nof the great informing, underlying idea that animates a truly great\nromance--_The Bride of Lammermoor_, _Monte Cristo_, _Les Miserables_,\n_The Scarlet Letter_, _The Master of Ballantrae_?  These questions can\nonly be answered by de-forming the impression given by each of these\nworks to present it in the chop-logic language of philosophy.  But an\napproach to an answer may be made by illustration.\n\nIn his _American Notebooks_ Nathaniel Hawthorne used to jot down subjects\nfor stories as they struck him.  His successive entries are like the\nsouls of stories awaiting embodiment, which many of them never received;\nthey bring us very near to the workings of the mind of a great master.\nHere are some of them:\n\n   'A sketch to be given of a modern reformer, a type of the extreme\n   doctrines on the subject of slaves, cold water, and the like.  He goes\n   about the streets haranguing most eloquently, and is on the point of\n   making many converts, when his labours are suddenly interrupted by the\n   appearance of the keeper of a madhouse whence he has escaped.  Much\n   may be made of this idea.'\n\n   'The scene of a story or sketch to be laid within the light of a\n   street lantern; the time when the lamp is near going out; and the\n   catastrophe to be simultaneous with the last flickering gleam.'\n\n   'A person to be writing a tale and to find it shapes itself against\n   his intentions; that the characters act otherwise than he thought, and\n   a catastrophe comes which he strives in vain to avert.  It might\n   shadow forth his own fate--he having made himself one of the\n   personages.'\n\n   'Two persons to be expecting some occurrence and watching for the two\n   principal actors in it, and to find that the occurrence is even then\n   passing, and that they themselves are the two actors.'\n\n   'A satire on ambition and fame from a statue of snow.'\n\nHawthorne used this idea in one of his sketches.\n\n   'A moral philosopher to buy a slave, or otherwise get possession of a\n   human being, and to use him for the sake of experiment by trying the\n   operation of a certain vice on him.'\n\nM. Bourget, the French romancer, has made use of this idea in his novel\ncalled _Le Disciple_. Only it is not a slave, but a young girl whom he\npretends to love, that is the subject of the moral philosopher's\nexperiment; and a noisy war has been waged round the book in France.\nHawthorne would plainly have seized the romantic essence of the idea and\nwould have avoided the boneyard of 'problem morality.'\n\n   'A story the principal personage of which shall seem always on the\n   point of entering on the scene, but shall never appear.'\n\nThis is the device that gives fascination to the figures of Richelieu in\n_Marion Delorme_, and of Captain Flint in _Treasure Island_.\n\n   'The majesty of death to be exemplified in a beggar, who, after being\n   seen humble and cringing in the streets of a city for many years, at\n   length by some means or other gets admittance into a rich man's\n   mansion, and there dies--assuming state, and striking awe into the\n   breasts of those who had looked down upon him.'\n\nThese are all excellent instances of the sort of idea that gives life to\na romance--of acts or attitudes that stamp themselves upon the mind's\neye.  Some of them appeal chiefly to the mind's eye, others are of value\nchiefly as symbols.  But, for the most part, the romantic kernel of a\nstory is neither pure picture nor pure allegory, it can neither be\npainted nor moralised.  It makes its most irresistible appeal neither to\nthe eye that searches for form and colour, nor to the reason that seeks\nfor abstract truth, but to the blood, to all that dim instinct of danger,\nmystery, and sympathy in things that is man's oldest inheritance--to the\nsuperstitions of the heart.  Romance vindicates the supernatural against\nscience and rescues it from the palsied tutelage of morality.\n\nStevenson's work is a gallery of romantic effects that haunt the memory.\nSome of these are directly pictorial: the fight in the round-house on\nboard the brig _Covenant_; the duel between the two brothers of\nBallantrae in the island of light thrown up by the candles from that\nabyss of windless night; the flight of the Princess Seraphina through the\ndark mazes of the wood,--all these, although they carry with them\nsubtleties beyond the painter's art, yet have something of picture in\nthem.  But others make entrance to the corridors of the mind by blind and\nsecret ways, and there awaken the echoes of primaeval fear.  The cry of\nthe parrot--'Pieces of eight'--the tapping of the stick of the blind\npirate Pew as he draws near the inn-parlour, and the similar effects of\ninexplicable terror wrought by the introduction of the blind catechist in\n_Kidnapped_, and of the disguise of a blind leper in _The Black Arrow_,\nare beyond the reach of any but the literary form of romantic art.  The\nlast appearance of Pew, in the play of _Admiral Guinea_, written in\ncollaboration with Mr. W. E. Henley, is perhaps the masterpiece of all\nthe scenes of terror.  The blind ruffian's scream of panic fear, when he\nputs his groping hand into the burning flame of the candle in the room\nwhere he believed that he was unseen, and so realises that his every\nmovement is being silently watched, is indeed 'the horrors come alive.'\n\nThe animating principle or idea of Stevenson's longer stories is never to\nbe found in their plot, which is generally built carelessly and\ndisjointedly enough around the central romantic situation or conception.\nThe main situation in _The Wrecker_ is a splendid product of romantic\naspiration, but the structure of the story is incoherent and ineffective,\nso that some of the best passages in the book--the scenes in Paris, for\ninstance--have no business there at all.  The story in _Kidnapped_ and\n_Catriona_ wanders on in a single thread, like the pageant of a dream,\nand the reader feels and sympathises with the author's obvious difficulty\nin leading it back to the scene of the trial and execution of James\nStewart.  _The Master of Ballantrae_ is stamped with a magnificent unity\nof conception, but the story illuminates that conception by a series of\nscattered episodes.\n\nThat lurid embodiment of fascinating evil, part vampire, part\nMephistopheles, whose grand manner and heroic abilities might have made\nhim a great and good man but for 'the malady of not wanting,' is the\nlight and meaning of the whole book.  Innocent and benevolent lives are\nthrown in his way that he may mock or distort or shatter them.  Stevenson\nnever came nearer than in this character to the sublime of power.\n\nBut an informing principle of unity is more readily to be apprehended in\nthe shorter stories, and it is a unity not so much of plot as of\nimpression and atmosphere.  His islands, whether situated in the Pacific\nor off the coast of Scotland, have each of them a climate of its own, and\nthe character of the place seems to impose itself on the incidents that\noccur, dictating subordination or contrast.  The events that happen\nwithin the limits of one of these magic isles could in every case be cut\noff from the rest of the story and framed as a separate work of art.  The\nlong starvation of David Balfour on the island of Earraid, the sharks of\ncrime and monsters of blasphemy that break the peace of the shining\ntropical lagoons in _Treasure Island_ and _The Ebb Tide_, the captivity\non the Bass Rock in _Catriona_, the supernatural terrors that hover and\nmutter over the island of _The Merry Men_--these imaginations are plainly\ngenerated by the scenery against which they are thrown; each is in some\nsort the genius of the place it inhabits.\n\nIn his search for the treasures of romance, Stevenson adventured freely\nenough into the realm of the supernatural.\n\nWhen he is handling the superstitions of the Scottish people, he allows\nhis humorous enjoyment of their extravagance to peep out from behind the\nsolemn dialect in which they are dressed.  The brief tale of _Thrawn\nJanet_, and Black Andy's story of Tod Lapraik in _Catriona_, are\ngrotesque imaginations of the school of _Tam o' Shanter_ rather than of\nthe school of Shakespeare, who deals in no comedy ghosts.  They are\nturnip-lanterns swayed by a laughing urchin, proud of the fears he can\nawaken.  Even _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ and the story\nof _The Bottle Imp_ are manufactured bogeys, that work on the nerves and\nnot on the heart, whatever may be said by those who insist on seeing\nallegory in what is only dream-fantasy.  The supernatural must be rooted\ndeeper than these in life and experience if it is to reach an imposing\nstature: the true ghost is the shadow of a man.  And Stevenson shows a\nsense of this in two of his very finest stories, the exquisite idyll of\n_Will o' the Mill_ and the grim history of _Markheim_.  Each of these\nstories is the work of a poet, by no means of a goblin-fancier.  The\npersonification of Death is as old as poetry; it is wrought with moving\ngentleness in that last scene in the arbour of Will's inn.  The wafted\nscent of the heliotropes, which had never been planted in the garden\nsince Marjory's death, the light in the room that had been hers, prelude\nthe arrival at the gate of the stranger's carriage, with the black pine\ntops standing above it like plumes.  And Will o' the Mill makes the\nacquaintance of his physician and friend, and goes at last upon his\ntravels.  In the other story, Markheim meets with his own double in the\nhouse of the dealer in curiosities, whom he has murdered.  It is not such\na double as Rossetti prayed for to the god of Sleep:\n\n   'Ah! might I, by thy good grace,\n      Groping in the windy stair\n   (Darkness and the breath of space\n      Like loud waters everywhere),\n   Meeting mine own image there\n         Face to face,\n   Send it from that place to her!'\n\nbut a clear-eyed critic of the murderer, not unfriendly, who lays bare\nbefore him his motives and history.  At the close of that wonderful\nconversation, one of the most brilliant of its author's achievements,\nMarkheim gives himself into the hands of the police.  These two stories,\nwhen compared with the others, serve to show how Stevenson's imagination\nquickened and strengthened when it played full upon life.  For his best\nromantic effects, like all great romance, are illuminative of life, and\nno mere idle games.\n\nIII.  MORALITY.--His genius, like the genius of Nathaniel Hawthorne, was\ndoubly rich in the spirit of romance and in a wise and beautiful\nmorality.  But the irresponsible caprices of his narrative fancy\nprevented his tales from being the appropriate vehicles of his morality.\nHe has left no work--unless the two short stories mentioned above be\nregarded as exceptions--in which romance and morality are welded into a\nsingle perfect whole, nothing that can be put beside _The Scarlet Letter_\nor _The Marble Faun_ for deep insight and magic fancy joined in one.\nHence his essays, containing as they do the gist of his reflective\nwisdom, are ranked by some critics above his stories.\n\nA novel cannot, of course, be moral as an action is moral; there is no\nquestion in art of police regulations or conformity to established codes,\nbut rather of insight both deep and wide.  Polygamy and monogamy, suttee,\nthuggism, and cannibalism, are all acceptable to the romancer, whose\nbusiness is with the heart of a man in all times and places.  He is not\nbound to display allegiance to particular moral laws of the kind that can\nbe broken; he is bound to show his consciousness of that wider moral\norder which can no more be broken by crime than the law of gravitation\ncan be broken by the fall of china--the morality without which life would\nbe impossible; the relations, namely, of human beings to each other, the\nfeelings, habits, and thoughts that are the web of society.  For the\nappreciation of morality in this wider sense high gifts of imagination\nare necessary.  Shakespeare could never have drawn Macbeth, and thereby\nmade apparent the awfulness of murder, without some sympathy for the\nmurderer--the sympathy of intelligence.  These gifts of imagination and\nsympathy belong to Stevenson in a very high degree; in all his romances\nthere are gleams from time to time of wise and subtle reflection upon\nlife, from the eternal side of things, which shine the more luminously\nthat they spring from the events and situations with no suspicion of\nhomily.  In _The Black Arrow_, Dick Shelton begs from the Duke of\nGloucester the life of the old shipmaster Arblaster, whose ship he had\ntaken and accidentally wrecked earlier in the story.  The Duke of\nGloucester, who, in his own words, 'loves not mercy nor mercy-mongers,'\nyields the favour reluctantly.  Then Dick turns to Arblaster.\n\n   '\"Come,\" said Dick, \"a life is a life, old shrew, and it is more than\n   ships or liquor.  Say you forgive me, for if your life is worth\n   nothing to you, it hath cost me the beginnings of my fortune.  Come, I\n   have paid for it dearly, be not so churlish.\"\n\n   '\"An I had my ship,\" said Arblaster, \"I would 'a' been forth and safe\n   on the high seas--I and my man Tom.  But ye took my ship, gossip, and\n   I'm a beggar; and for my man Tom, a knave fellow in russet shot him\n   down, 'Murrain,' quoth he, and spake never again.  'Murrain' was the\n   last of his words, and the poor spirit of him passed.  'A will never\n   sail no more, will my Tom.\"\n\n   'Dick was seized with unavailing penitence and pity; he sought to take\n   the skipper's hand, but Arblaster avoided his touch.\n\n   '\"Nay,\" said he, \"let be.  Y' have played the devil with me, and let\n   that content you.\"\n\n   'The words died in Richard's throat.  He saw, through tears, the poor\n   old man, bemused with liquor and sorrow, go shambling away, with bowed\n   head, across the snow, and the unnoticed dog whimpering at his heels;\n   and for the first time began to understand the desperate game that we\n   play in life, and how a thing once done is not to be changed or\n   remedied by any penitence.'\n\nA similar wisdom that goes to the heart of things is found on the lips of\nthe spiritual visitant in Markheim.\n\n   '\"Murder is to me no special category,\" replied the other.  \"All sins\n   are murder, even as all life is war.  I behold your race, like\n   starving mariners on a raft, plucking crusts out of the hands of\n   famine, and feeding on each other's lives.  I follow sins beyond the\n   moment of their acting; I find in all that the last consequence is\n   death; and to my eyes the pretty maid, who thwarts her mother with\n   such taking graces on a question of a ball, drips no less visibly with\n   human gore than such a murderer as yourself.\"'\n\nThe wide outlook on humanity that expresses itself in passages like these\nis combined in Stevenson with a vivid interest in, and quick appreciation\nof, character.  The variety of the characters that he has essayed to draw\nis enormous, and his successes, for the purposes of his stories, are\nmany.  Yet with all this, the number of lifelike portraits, true to a\nhair, that are to be found in his works is very small indeed.  In the\ngolden glow of romance, character is always subject to be idealised; it\nis the effect of character seen at particular angles and in special\nlights, natural or artificial, that Stevenson paints; he does not attempt\nto analyse the complexity of its elements, but boldly projects into it\ncertain principles, and works from those.  It has often been said of\nScott that he could not draw a lady who was young and beautiful; the\nglamour of chivalry blinded him, he lowered his eyes and described his\nemotions and aspirations.  Something of the same disability afflicted\nStevenson in the presence of a ruffian.  He loved heroic vice only less\nthan he loved heroic virtue, and was always ready to idealise his\nvillains, to make of them men who, like the Master of Ballantrae, 'lived\nfor an idea.'  Even the low and lesser villainy of Israel Hands, in the\ngreat scene where he climbs the mast to murder the hero of _Treasure\nIsland_, breathes out its soul in a creed:\n\n   '\"For thirty years,\" he said, \"I've sailed the seas, and seen good and\n   bad, better and worse, provisions running out, knives going, and what\n   not.  Well, now I tell you, I never seen good come o' goodness yet.\n   Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don't bite; them's my\n   views--Amen, so be it.\"'\n\nJohn Silver, that memorable pirate, with a face like a ham and an eye\nlike a fragment of glass stuck into it, leads a career of wholehearted\ncrime that can only be described as sparkling.  His unalloyed maleficence\nis adorned with a thousand graces of manner.  Into the dark and fetid\nmarsh that is an evil heart, where low forms of sentiency are hardly\ndistinguishable from the all-pervading mud, Stevenson never peered,\nunless it were in the study of Huish in _The Ebb Tide_.\n\nOf his women, let women speak.  They are traditionally accredited with an\nintuition of one another's hearts, although why, if woman was created for\nman, as the Scriptures assure us, the impression that she makes on him\nshould not count for as much as the impression she makes on some other\nwoman, is a question that cries for solution.  Perhaps the answer is that\ndisinterested curiosity, which is one means of approach to the knowledge\nof character, although only one, is a rare attitude for man to assume\ntowards the other sex.  Stevenson's curiosity was late in awaking; the\nheroine of _The Black Arrow_ is dressed in boy's clothes throughout the\ncourse of the story, and the novelist thus saved the trouble of\ndescribing the demeanour of a girl.  Mrs. Henry, in _The Master of\nBallantrae_, is a charming veiled figure, drawn in the shadow; Miss\nBarbara Grant and Catriona in the continuation of _Kidnapped_ are real\nenough to have made many suitors for their respective hands among male\nreaders of the book;--but that is nothing, reply the critics of the other\nparty: a walking doll will find suitors.  The question must stand over\nuntil some definite principles of criticism have been discovered to guide\nus among these perilous passes.\n\nOne character must never be passed over in an estimate of Stevenson's\nwork.  The hero of his longest work is not David Balfour, in whom the\npawky Lowland lad, proud and precise, but 'a very pretty gentleman,' is\ntransfigured at times by traits that he catches, as narrator of the\nstory, from its author himself.  But Alan Breek Stewart is a greater\ncreation, and a fine instance of that wider morality that can seize by\nsympathy the soul of a wild Highland clansman.  'Impetuous, insolent,\nunquenchable,' a condoner of murder (for 'them that havenae dipped their\nhands in any little difficulty should be very mindful of the case of them\nthat have'), a confirmed gambler, as quarrel-some as a turkey-cock, and\nas vain and sensitive as a child, Alan Breek is one of the most lovable\ncharacters in all literature; and his penetration--a great part of which\nhe learned, to take his own account of it, by driving cattle 'through a\nthrong lowland country with the black soldiers at his tail'--blossoms\ninto the most delightful reflections upon men and things.\n\nThe highest ambitions of a novelist are not easily attainable.  To\ncombine incident, character, and romance in a uniform whole, to alternate\ntelling dramatic situation with effects of poetry and suggestion, to\nbreathe into the entire conception a profound wisdom, construct it with\nabsolute unity, and express it in perfect style,--this thing has never\nyet been done.  A great part of Stevenson's subtle wisdom of life finds\nits readiest outlet in his essays.  In these, whatever their occasion, he\nshows himself the clearest-eyed critic of human life, never the dupe of\nthe phrases and pretences, the theories and conventions, that distort the\nvision of most writers and thinkers.  He has an unerring instinct for\nrealities, and brushes aside all else with rapid grace.  In his lately\npublished _Amateur Emigrant_ he describes one of his fellow-passengers to\nAmerica:\n\n   'In truth it was not whisky that had ruined him; he was ruined long\n   before for all good human purposes but conversation.  His eyes were\n   sealed by a cheap school-book materialism.  He could see nothing in\n   the world but money and steam engines.  He did not know what you meant\n   by the word happiness.  He had forgotten the simple emotions of\n   childhood, and perhaps never encountered the delights of youth.  He\n   believed in production, that useful figment of economy, as if it had\n   been real, like laughter; and production, without prejudice to liquor,\n   was his god and guide.'\n\nThis sense of the realities of the world,--laughter, happiness, the\nsimple emotions of childhood, and others,--makes Stevenson an admirable\ncritic of those social pretences that ape the native qualities of the\nheart.  The criticism on organised philanthropy contained in the essay on\n_Beggars_ is not exhaustive, it is expressed paradoxically, but is it\nuntrue?\n\n   'We should wipe two words from our vocabulary: gratitude and charity.\n   In real life, help is given out of friendship, or it is not valued; it\n   is received from the hand of friendship, or it is resented.  We are\n   all too proud to take a naked gift; we must seem to pay it, if in\n   nothing else, then with the delights of our society.  Here, then, is\n   the pitiful fix of the rich man; here is that needle's eye in which he\n   stuck already in the days of Christ, and still sticks to-day, firmer,\n   if possible, than ever; that he has the money, and lacks the love\n   which should make his money acceptable.  Here and now, just as of old\n   in Palestine, he has the rich to dinner, it is with the rich that he\n   takes his pleasure: and when his turn comes to be charitable, he looks\n   in vain for a recipient.  His friends are not poor, they do not want;\n   the poor are not his friends, they will not take.  To whom is he to\n   give?  Where to find--note this phrase--the Deserving Poor?  Charity\n   is (what they call) centralised; offices are hired; societies founded,\n   with secretaries paid or unpaid: the hunt of the Deserving Poor goes\n   merrily forward.  I think it will take a more than merely human\n   secretary to disinter that character.  What! a class that is to be in\n   want from no fault of its own, and yet greedily eager to receive from\n   strangers; and to be quite respectable, and at the same time quite\n   devoid of self-respect; and play the most delicate part of friendship,\n   and yet never be seen; and wear the form of man, and yet fly in the\n   face of all the laws of human nature:--and all this, in the hope of\n   getting a belly-god burgess through a needle's eye!  Oh, let him\n   stick, by all means; and let his polity tumble in the dust; and let\n   his epitaph and all his literature (of which my own works begin to\n   form no inconsiderable part) be abolished even from the history of\n   man!  For a fool of this monstrosity of dulness there can be no\n   salvation; and the fool who looked for the elixir of life was an angel\n   of reason to the fool who looks for the Deserving Poor.'\n\nAn equal sense of the realities of life and death gives the force of a\nnatural law to the pathos of _Old Mortality_, that essay in which\nStevenson pays passionate tribute to the memory of his early friend, who\n'had gone to ruin with a kingly abandon, like one who condescended; but\nonce ruined, with the lights all out, he fought as for a kingdom.'  The\nwhole description, down to the marvellous quotation from Bunyan that\ncloses it, is one of the sovereign passages of modern literature; the\npathos of it is pure and elemental, like the rush of a cleansing wind, or\nthe onset of the legions commanded by\n\n   'The mighty Mahmud, Allah-breathing Lord,\n   That all the misbelieving and black Horde\n      Of Fears and Sorrows that infest the Soul\n   Scatters before him with his whirlwind Sword.'\n\nLastly, to bring to an end this imperfect review of the works of a writer\nwho has left none greater behind him, Stevenson excels at what is perhaps\nthe most delicate of literary tasks and the utmost test, where it is\nsuccessfully encountered, of nobility,--the practice, namely, of self-\nrevelation and self-delineation.  To talk much about oneself with detail,\ncomposure, and ease, with no shadow of hypocrisy and no whiff or taint of\nindecent familiarity, no puling and no posing,--the shores of the sea of\nliterature are strewn with the wrecks and forlorn properties of those who\nhave adventured on this dangerous attempt.  But a criticism of Stevenson\nis happy in this, that from the writer it can pass with perfect trust and\nperfect fluency to the man.  He shares with Goldsmith and Montaigne, his\nown favourite, the happy privilege of making lovers among his readers.\n'To be the most beloved of English writers--what a title that is for a\nman!' says Thackeray of Goldsmith.  In such matters, a dispute for pre-\neminence in the captivation of hearts would be unseemly; it is enough to\nsay that Stevenson too has his lovers among those who have accompanied\nhim on his _Inland Voyage_, or through the fastnesses of the Cevennes in\nthe wake of Modestine.  He is loved by those that never saw his face; and\none who has sealed that dizzy height of ambition may well be content,\nwithout the impertinent assurance that, when the Japanese have taken\nLondon and revised the contents of the British Museum, the yellow scribes\nwhom they shall set to produce a new edition of the _Biographie\nUniverselle_ will include in their entries the following\nitem:--'_Stevenson_, _R. L._  _A prolific writer of stories among the\naborigines_.  _Flourished before the Coming of the Japanese_. _His works\nare lost_.'\n\nTHE END\n\nBILLING AND SONS, LTD., PRINTERS, GUILDFORD",
