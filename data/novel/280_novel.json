Four times at least it occurs as a\nplace-name.  There is a parish of Stevenston in Cunningham; a second\nplace of the name in the Barony of Bothwell in Lanark; a third on Lyne,\nabove Drochil Castle; the fourth on the Tyne, near Traprain Law.\nStevenson of Stevenson (co. Lanark) swore fealty to Edward I in 1296, and\nthe last of that family died after the Restoration.  Stevensons of\nHirdmanshiels, in Midlothian, rode in the Bishops’ Raid of Aberlady,\nserved as jurors, stood bail for neighbours—Hunter of Polwood, for\ninstance—and became extinct about the same period, or possibly earlier.\nA Stevenson of Luthrie and another of Pitroddie make their bows, give\ntheir names, and vanish.  And by the year 1700 it does not appear that\nany acre of Scots land was vested in any Stevenson. {2a}\n\nHere is, so far, a melancholy picture of backward progress, and a family\nposting towards extinction.  But the law (however administered, and I am\nbound to aver that, in Scotland, ‘it couldna weel be waur’) acts as a\nkind of dredge, and with dispassionate impartiality brings up into the\nlight of day, and shows us for a moment, in the jury-box or on the\ngallows, the creeping things of the past.  By these broken glimpses we\nare able to trace the existence of many other and more inglorious\nStevensons, picking a private way through the brawl that makes Scots\nhistory.  They were members of Parliament for Peebles, Stirling,\nPittenweem, Kilrenny, and Inverurie.  We find them burgesses of\nEdinburgh; indwellers in Biggar, Perth, and Dalkeith.  Thomas was the\nforester of Newbattle Park, Gavin was a baker, John a maltman, Francis a\nchirurgeon, and ‘Schir William’ a priest.  In the feuds of Humes and\nHeatleys, Cunninghams, Montgomeries, Mures, Ogilvies, and Turnbulls, we\nfind them inconspicuously involved, and apparently getting rather better\nthan they gave.  Schir William (reverend gentleman) was cruellie\nslaughtered on the Links of Kincraig in 1582; James (‘in the mill-town of\nRoberton’), murdered in 1590; Archibald (‘in Gallowfarren’), killed with\nshots of pistols and hagbuts in 1608.  Three violent deaths in about\nseventy years, against which we can only put the case of Thomas, servant\nto Hume of Cowden Knowes, who was arraigned with his two young masters\nfor the death of the Bastard of Mellerstanes in 1569.  John (‘in\nDalkeith’) stood sentry without Holyrood while the banded lords were\ndespatching Rizzio within.  William, at the ringing of Perth bell, ran\nbefore Gowrie House ‘with ane sword, and, entering to the yearde, saw\nGeorge Craiggingilt with ane twa-handit sword and utheris nychtbouris; at\nquilk time James Boig cryit ower ane wynds, “Awa hame! ye will all be\nhangit”’—a piece of advice which William took, and immediately\n‘depairtit.’  John got a maid with child to him in Biggar, and seemingly\ndeserted her; she was hanged on the Castle Hill for infanticide, June\n1614; and Martin, elder in Dalkeith, eternally disgraced the name by\nsigning witness in a witch trial, 1661.  These are two of our black\nsheep. {3a}  Under the Restoration, one Stevenson was a bailie in\nEdinburgh, and another the lessee of the Canonmills.  There were at the\nsame period two physicians of the name in Edinburgh, one of whom, Dr.\nArchibald, appears to have been a famous man in his day and generation.\nThe Court had continual need of him; it was he who reported, for\ninstance, on the state of Rumbold; and he was for some time in the\nenjoyment of a pension of a thousand pounds Scots (about eighty pounds\nsterling) at a time when five hundred pounds is described as ‘an opulent\nfuture.’  I do not know if I should be glad or sorry that he failed to\nkeep favour; but on 6th January 1682 (rather a cheerless New Year’s\npresent) his pension was expunged. {4a}  There need be no doubt, at\nleast, of my exultation at the fact that he was knighted and recorded\narms.  Not quite so genteel, but still in public life, Hugh was\nUnder-Clerk to the Privy Council, and liked being so extremely.  I gather\nthis from his conduct in September 1681, when, with all the lords and\ntheir servants, he took the woful and soul-destroying Test, swearing it\n‘word by word upon his knees.’  And, behold! it was in vain, for Hugh was\nturned out of his small post in 1684. {4b}  Sir Archibald and Hugh were\nboth plainly inclined to be trimmers; but there was one witness of the\nname of Stevenson who held high the banner of the Covenant—John,\n‘Land-Labourer, {4c} in the parish of Daily, in Carrick,’ that ‘eminently\npious man.’  He seems to have been a poor sickly soul, and shows himself\ndisabled with scrofula, and prostrate and groaning aloud with fever; but\nthe enthusiasm of the martyr burned high within him.\n\n‘I was made to take joyfully the spoiling of my goods, and with pleasure\nfor His name’s sake wandered in deserts and in mountains, in dens and\ncaves of the earth.  I lay four months in the coldest season of the year\nin a haystack in my father’s garden, and a whole February in the open\nfields not far from Camragen, and this I did without the least prejudice\nfrom the night air; one night, when lying in the fields near to the\nCarrick-Miln, I was all covered with snow in the morning.  Many nights\nhave I lain with pleasure in the churchyard of Old Daily, and made a\ngrave my pillow; frequently have I resorted to the old walls about the\nglen, near to Camragen, and there sweetly rested.’  The visible band of\nGod protected and directed him.  Dragoons were turned aside from the\nbramble-bush where he lay hidden.  Miracles were performed for his\nbehoof.  ‘I got a horse and a woman to carry the child, and came to the\nsame mountain, where I wandered by the mist before; it is commonly known\nby the name of Kellsrhins: when we came to go up the mountain, there came\non a great rain, which we thought was the occasion of the child’s\nweeping, and she wept so bitterly, that all we could do could not divert\nher from it, so that she was ready to burst.  When we got to the top of\nthe mountain, where the Lord had been formerly kind to my soul in prayer,\nI looked round me for a stone, and espying one, I went and brought it.\nWhen the woman with me saw me set down the stone, she smiled, and asked\nwhat I was going to do with it.  I told her I was going to set it up as\nmy Ebenezer, because hitherto, and in that place, the Lord had formerly\nhelped, and I hoped would yet help.  The rain still continuing, the child\nweeping bitterly, I went to prayer, and no sooner did I cry to God, but\nthe child gave over weeping, and when we got up from prayer, the rain was\npouring down on every side, but in the way where we were to go there fell\nnot one drop; the place not rained on was as big as an ordinary avenue.’\nAnd so great a saint was the natural butt of Satan’s persecutions.  ‘I\nretired to the fields for secret prayer about mid-night.  When I went to\npray I was much straitened, and could not get one request, but “Lord\npity,” “Lord help”; this I came over frequently; at length the terror of\nSatan fell on me in a high degree, and all I could say even then\nwas—“Lord help.”  I continued in the duty for some time, notwithstanding\nof this terror.  At length I got up to my feet, and the terror still\nincreased; then the enemy took me by the arm-pits, and seemed to lift me\nup by my arms.  I saw a loch just before me, and I concluded he designed\nto throw me there by force; and had he got leave to do so, it might have\nbrought a great reproach upon religion. {7a}  But it was otherwise\nordered, and the cause of piety escaped that danger. {7b}\n\nOn the whole, the Stevensons may be described as decent, reputable folk,\nfollowing honest trades—millers, maltsters, and doctors, playing the\ncharacter parts in the Waverley Novels with propriety, if without\ndistinction; and to an orphan looking about him in the world for a\npotential ancestry, offering a plain and quite unadorned refuge, equally\nfree from shame and glory.  John, the land-labourer, is the one living\nand memorable figure, and he, alas! cannot possibly be more near than a\ncollateral.  It was on August 12, 1678, that he heard Mr. John Welsh on\nthe Craigdowhill, and ‘took the heavens, earth, and sun in the firmament\nthat was shining on us, as also the ambassador who made the offer, and\n_the clerk who raised the psalms_, to witness that I did give myself away\nto the Lord in a personal and perpetual covenant never to be forgotten’;\nand already, in 1675, the birth of my direct ascendant was registered in\nGlasgow.  So that I have been pursuing ancestors too far down; and John\nthe land-labourer is debarred me, and I must relinquish from the trophies\nof my house his _rare soul-strengthening and comforting cordial_.  It is\nthe same case with the Edinburgh bailie and the miller of the Canonmills,\nworthy man! and with that public character, Hugh the Under-Clerk, and,\nmore than all, with Sir Archibald, the physician, who recorded arms.  And\nI am reduced to a family of inconspicuous maltsters in what was then the\nclean and handsome little city on the Clyde.\n\nThe name has a certain air of being Norse.  But the story of Scottish\nnomenclature is confounded by a continual process of translation and\nhalf-translation from the Gaelic which in olden days may have been\nsometimes reversed.  Roy becomes Reid; Gow, Smith.  A great Highland clan\nuses the name of Robertson; a sept in Appin that of Livingstone; Maclean\nin Glencoe answers to Johnstone at Lockerby.  And we find such hybrids as\nMacalexander for Macallister.  There is but one rule to be deduced: that\nhowever uncompromisingly Saxon a name may appear, you can never be sure\nit does not designate a Celt.  My great-grandfather wrote the name\n_Stevenson_ but pronounced it _Steenson_, after the fashion of the\nimmortal minstrel in _Redgauntlet_; and this elision of a medial\nconsonant appears a Gaelic process; and, curiously enough, I have come\nacross no less than two Gaelic forms: _John Macstophane cordinerius in\nCrossraguel_, 1573, and _William M’Steen_ in Dunskeith (co. Ross), 1605.\nStevenson, Steenson, Macstophane, M’Steen: which is the original? which\nthe translation?  Or were these separate creations of the patronymic,\nsome English, some Gaelic?  The curiously compact territory in which we\nfind them seated—Ayr, Lanark, Peebles, Stirling, Perth, Fife, and the\nLothians—would seem to forbid the supposition. {9a}\n\n‘STEVENSON—or according to tradition of one of the proscribed of the clan\nMacGregor, who was born among the willows or in a hill-side\nsheep-pen—“Son of my love,” a heraldic bar sinister, but history reveals\na reason for the birth among the willows far other than the sinister\naspect of the name’: these are the dark words of Mr. Cosmo Innes; but\nhistory or tradition, being interrogated, tells a somewhat tangled tale.\nThe heir of Macgregor of Glenorchy, murdered about 1858 by the Argyll\nCampbells, appears to have been the original ‘Son of my love’; and his\nmore loyal clansmen took the name to fight under.  It may be supposed the\nstory of their resistance became popular, and the name in some sort\nidentified with the idea of opposition to the Campbells.  Twice\nafterwards, on some renewed aggression, in 1502 and 1552, we find the\nMacgregors again banding themselves into a sept of ‘Sons of my love’; and\nwhen the great disaster fell on them in 1603, the whole original legend\nreappears, and we have the heir of Alaster of Glenstrae born ‘among the\nwillows’ of a fugitive mother, and the more loyal clansmen again rallying\nunder the name of Stevenson.  A story would not be told so often unless\nit had some base in fact; nor (if there were no bond at all between the\nRed Macgregors and the Stevensons) would that extraneous and somewhat\nuncouth name be so much repeated in the legends of the Children of the\nMist.\n\nBut I am enabled, by my very lively and obliging correspondent, Mr.\nGeorge A. Macgregor Stevenson of New York, to give an actual instance.\nHis grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather, and\ngreat-great-great-grandfather, all used the names of Macgregor and\nStevenson as occasion served; being perhaps Macgregor by night and\nStevenson by day.  The great-great-great-grandfather was a mighty man of\nhis hands, marched with the clan in the ‘Forty-five, and returned with\n_spolia opima_ in the shape of a sword, which he had wrested from an\nofficer in the retreat, and which is in the possession of my\ncorrespondent to this day.  His great-grandson (the grandfather of my\ncorrespondent), being converted to Methodism by some wayside preacher,\ndiscarded in a moment his name, his old nature, and his political\nprinciples, and with the zeal of a proselyte sealed his adherence to the\nProtestant Succession by baptising his next son George.  This George\nbecame the publisher and editor of the _Wesleyan Times_.  His children\nwere brought up in ignorance of their Highland pedigree; and my\ncorrespondent was puzzled to overhear his father speak of him as a true\nMacgregor, and amazed to find, in rummaging about that peaceful and pious\nhouse, the sword of the Hanoverian officer.  After he was grown up and\nwas better informed of his descent, ‘I frequently asked my father,’ he\nwrites, ‘why he did not use the name of Macgregor; his replies were\nsignificant, and give a picture of the man: “It isn’t a good _Methodist_\nname.  You can use it, but it will do you no _good_.”  Yet the old\ngentleman, by way of pleasantry, used to announce himself to friends as\n“Colonel Macgregor.”’\n\nHere, then, are certain Macgregors habitually using the name of\nStevenson, and at last, under the influence of Methodism, adopting it\nentirely.  Doubtless a proscribed clan could not be particular; they took\na name as a man takes an umbrella against a shower; as Rob Roy took\nCampbell, and his son took Drummond.  But this case is different;\nStevenson was not taken and left—it was consistently adhered to.  It does\nnot in the least follow that all Stevensons are of the clan Alpin; but it\ndoes follow that some may be.  And I cannot conceal from myself the\npossibility that James Stevenson in Glasgow, my first authentic ancestor,\nmay have had a Highland _alias_ upon his conscience and a claymore in his\nback parlour.\n\nTo one more tradition I may allude, that we are somehow descended from a\nFrench barber-surgeon who came to St. Andrews in the service of one of\nthe Cardinal Beatons.  No details were added.  But the very name of\nFrance was so detested in my family for three generations, that I am\ntempted to suppose there may be something in it. {12a}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I: DOMESTIC ANNALS\n\n\nIt is believed that in 1665, James Stevenson in Nether Carsewell, parish\nof Neilston, county of Renfrew, and presumably a tenant farmer, married\none Jean Keir; and in 1675, without doubt, there was born to these two a\nson Robert, possibly a maltster in Glasgow.  In 1710, Robert married, for\na second time, Elizabeth Cumming, and there was born to them, in 1720,\nanother Robert, certainly a maltster in Glasgow.  In 1742, Robert the\nsecond married Margaret Fulton (Margret, she called herself), by whom he\nhad ten children, among whom were Hugh, born February 1749, and Alan,\nborn June 1752.\n\nWith these two brothers my story begins.  Their deaths were simultaneous;\ntheir lives unusually brief and full.  Tradition whispered me in\nchildhood they were the owners of an islet near St. Kitts; and it is\ncertain they had risen to be at the head of considerable interests in the\nWest Indies, which Hugh managed abroad and Alan at home, at an age when\nothers are still curveting a clerk’s stool.  My kinsman, Mr. Stevenson of\nStirling, has heard his father mention that there had been ‘something\nromantic’ about Alan’s marriage: and, alas! he has forgotten what.  It\nwas early at least.  His wife was Jean, daughter of David Lillie, a\nbuilder in Glasgow, and several times ‘Deacon of the Wrights’: the date\nof the marriage has not reached me; but on 8th June 1772, when Robert,\nthe only child of the union, was born, the husband and father had scarce\npassed, or had not yet attained, his twentieth year.  Here was a youth\nmaking haste to give hostages to fortune.  But this early scene of\nprosperity in love and business was on the point of closing.\n\nThere hung in the house of this young family, and successively in those\nof my grandfather and father, an oil painting of a ship of many tons\nburthen.  Doubtless the brothers had an interest in the vessel; I was\ntold she had belonged to them outright; and the picture was preserved\nthrough years of hardship, and remains to this day in the possession of\nthe family, the only memorial of my great-grandsire Alan.  It was on this\nship that he sailed on his last adventure, summoned to the West Indies by\nHugh.  An agent had proved unfaithful on a serious scale; and it used to\nbe told me in my childhood how the brothers pursued him from one island\nto another in an open boat, were exposed to the pernicious dews of the\ntropics, and simultaneously struck down.  The dates and places of their\ndeaths (now before me) would seem to indicate a more scattered and\nprolonged pursuit: Hugh, on the 16th April 1774, in Tobago, within sight\nof Trinidad; Alan, so late as 26th May, and so far away as ‘Santt\nKittes,’ in the Leeward Islands—both, says the family Bible, ‘of a\nfiver’(!).  The death of Hugh was probably announced by Alan in a letter,\nto which we may refer the details of the open boat and the dew.  Thus, at\nleast, in something like the course of post, both were called away, the\none twenty-five, the other twenty-two; their brief generation became\nextinct, their short-lived house fell with them; and ‘in these lawless\nparts and lawless times’—the words are my grandfather’s—their property\nwas stolen or became involved.  Many years later, I understand some small\nrecovery to have been made; but at the moment almost the whole means of\nthe family seem to have perished with the young merchants.  On the 27th\nApril, eleven days after Hugh Stevenson, twenty-nine before Alan, died\nDavid Lillie, the Deacon of the Wrights; so that mother and son were\norphaned in one month.  Thus, from a few scraps of paper bearing little\nbeyond dates, we construct the outlines of the tragedy that shadowed the\ncradle of Robert Stevenson.\n\nJean Lillie was a young woman of strong sense, well fitted to contend\nwith poverty, and of a pious disposition, which it is like that these\nmisfortunes heated.  Like so many other widowed Scots-women, she vowed\nher son should wag his head in a pulpit; but her means were inadequate to\nher ambition.  A charity school, and some time under a Mr. M’Intyre, ‘a\nfamous linguist,’ were all she could afford in the way of education to\nthe would-be minister.  He learned no Greek; in one place he mentions\nthat the Orations of Cicero were his highest book in Latin; in another\nthat he had ‘delighted’ in Virgil and Horace; but his delight could never\nhave been scholarly.  This appears to have been the whole of his training\nprevious to an event which changed his own destiny and moulded that of\nhis descendants—the second marriage of his mother.\n\nThere was a Merchant-Burgess of Edinburgh of the name of Thomas Smith.\nThe Smith pedigree has been traced a little more particularly than the\nStevensons’, with a similar dearth of illustrious names.  One character\nseems to have appeared, indeed, for a moment at the wings of history: a\nskipper of Dundee who smuggled over some Jacobite big-wig at the time of\nthe ‘Fifteen, and was afterwards drowned in Dundee harbour while going on\nboard his ship.  With this exception, the generations of the Smiths\npresent no conceivable interest even to a descendant; and Thomas, of\nEdinburgh, was the first to issue from respectable obscurity.  His\nfather, a skipper out of Broughty Ferry, was drowned at sea while Thomas\nwas still young.  He seems to have owned a ship or two—whalers, I\nsuppose, or coasters—and to have been a member of the Dundee Trinity\nHouse, whatever that implies.  On his death the widow remained in\nBroughty, and the son came to push his future in Edinburgh.  There is a\nstory told of him in the family which I repeat here because I shall have\nto tell later on a similar, but more perfectly authenticated, experience\nof his stepson, Robert Stevenson.  Word reached Thomas that his mother\nwas unwell, and he prepared to leave for Broughty on the morrow.  It was\nbetween two and three in the morning, and the early northern daylight was\nalready clear, when he awoke and beheld the curtains at the bed-foot\ndrawn aside and his mother appear in the interval, smile upon him for a\nmoment, and then vanish.  The sequel is stereo-type; he took the time by\nhis watch, and arrived at Broughty to learn it was the very moment of her\ndeath.  The incident is at least curious in having happened to such a\nperson—as the tale is being told of him.  In all else, he appears as a\nman ardent, passionate, practical, designed for affairs and prospering in\nthem far beyond the average.  He founded a solid business in lamps and\noils, and was the sole proprietor of a concern called the Greenside\nCompany’s Works—‘a multifarious concern it was,’ writes my cousin,\nProfessor Swan, ‘of tinsmiths, coppersmiths, brass-founders, blacksmiths,\nand japanners.’  He was also, it seems, a shipowner and underwriter.  He\nbuilt himself ‘a land’—Nos. 1 and 2 Baxter’s Place, then no such\nunfashionable neighbourhood—and died, leaving his only son in easy\ncircumstances, and giving to his three surviving daughters portions of\nfive thousand pounds and upwards.  There is no standard of success in\nlife; but in one of its meanings, this is to succeed.\n\nIn what we know of his opinions, he makes a figure highly characteristic\nof the time.  A high Tory and patriot, a captain—so I find it in my\nnotes—of Edinburgh Spearmen, and on duty in the Castle during the Muir\nand Palmer troubles, he bequeathed to his descendants a bloodless sword\nand a somewhat violent tradition, both long preserved.  The judge who sat\non Muir and Palmer, the famous Braxfield, let fall from the bench the\n_obiter dictum_—‘I never liked the French all my days, but now I hate\nthem.’  If Thomas Smith, the Edinburgh Spearman, were in court, he must\nhave been tempted to applaud.  The people of that land were his\nabhorrence; he loathed Buonaparte like Antichrist.  Towards the end he\nfell into a kind of dotage; his family must entertain him with games of\ntin soldiers, which he took a childish pleasure to array and overset; but\nthose who played with him must be upon their guard, for if his side,\nwhich was always that of the English against the French, should chance to\nbe defeated, there would be trouble in Baxter’s Place.  For these\nopinions he may almost be said to have suffered.  Baptised and brought up\nin the Church of Scotland, he had, upon some conscientious scruple,\njoined the communion of the Baptists.  Like other Nonconformists, these\nwere inclined to the Liberal side in politics, and, at least in the\nbeginning, regarded Buonaparte as a deliverer.  From the time of his\njoining the Spearmen, Thomas Smith became in consequence a bugbear to his\nbrethren in the faith.   ‘They that take the sword shall perish with the\nsword,’ they told him; they gave him ‘no rest’; ‘his position became\nintolerable’; it was plain he must choose between his political and his\nreligious tenets; and in the last years of his life, about 1812, he\nreturned to the Church of his fathers.\n\nAugust 1786 was the date of his chief advancement, when, having designed\na system of oil lights to take the place of the primitive coal fires\nbefore in use, he was dubbed engineer to the newly-formed Board of\nNorthern Lighthouses.  Not only were his fortunes bettered by the\nappointment, but he was introduced to a new and wider field for the\nexercise of his abilities, and a new way of life highly agreeable to his\nactive constitution.  He seems to have rejoiced in the long journeys, and\nto have combined them with the practice of field sports.  ‘A tall, stout\nman coming ashore with his gun over his arm’—so he was described to my\nfather—the only description that has come down to me by a light-keeper\nold in the service.  Nor did this change come alone.  On the 9th July of\nthe same year, Thomas Smith had been left for the second time a widower.\nAs he was still but thirty-three years old, prospering in his affairs,\nnewly advanced in the world, and encumbered at the time with a family of\nchildren, five in number, it was natural that he should entertain the\nnotion of another wife.  Expeditious in business, he was no less so in\nhis choice; and it was not later than June 1787—for my grandfather is\ndescribed as still in his fifteenth year—that he married the widow of\nAlan Stevenson.\n\nThe perilous experiment of bringing together two families for once\nsucceeded.  Mr. Smith’s two eldest daughters, Jean and Janet, fervent in\npiety, unwearied in kind deeds, were well qualified both to appreciate\nand to attract the stepmother; and her son, on the other hand, seems to\nhave found immediate favour in the eyes of Mr. Smith.  It is, perhaps,\neasy to exaggerate the ready-made resemblances; the tired woman must have\ndone much to fashion girls who were under ten; the man, lusty and\nopinionated, must have stamped a strong impression on the boy of fifteen.\nBut the cleavage of the family was too marked, the identity of character\nand interest produced between the two men on the one hand, and the three\nwomen on the other, was too complete to have been the result of influence\nalone.  Particular bonds of union must have pre-existed on each side.\nAnd there is no doubt that the man and the boy met with common ambitions,\nand a common bent, to the practice of that which had not so long before\nacquired the name of civil engineering.\n\nFor the profession which is now so thronged, famous, and influential, was\nthen a thing of yesterday.  My grandfather had an anecdote of Smeaton,\nprobably learned from John Clerk of Eldin, their common friend.  Smeaton\nwas asked by the Duke of Argyll to visit the West Highland coast for a\nprofessional purpose.  He refused, appalled, it seems, by the rough\ntravelling.  ‘You can recommend some other fit person?’ asked the Duke.\n‘No,’ said Smeaton, ‘I’m sorry I can’t.’  ‘What!’ cried the Duke, ‘a\nprofession with only one man in it!  Pray, who taught you?’  ‘Why,’ said\nSmeaton, ‘I believe I may say I was self-taught, an’t please your grace.’\nSmeaton, at the date of Thomas Smith’s third marriage, was yet living;\nand as the one had grown to the new profession from his place at the\ninstrument-maker’s, the other was beginning to enter it by the way of his\ntrade.  The engineer of to-day is confronted with a library of acquired\nresults; tables and formulae to the value of folios full have been\ncalculated and recorded; and the student finds everywhere in front of him\nthe footprints of the pioneers.  In the eighteenth century the field was\nlargely unexplored; the engineer must read with his own eyes the face of\nnature; he arose a volunteer, from the workshop or the mill, to undertake\nworks which were at once inventions and adventures.  It was not a science\nthen—it was a living art; and it visibly grew under the eyes and between\nthe hands of its practitioners.\n\nThe charm of such an occupation was strongly felt by stepfather and\nstepson.  It chanced that Thomas Smith was a reformer; the superiority of\nhis proposed lamp and reflectors over open fires of coal secured his\nappointment; and no sooner had he set his hand to the task than the\ninterest of that employment mastered him.  The vacant stage on which he\nwas to act, and where all had yet to be created—the greatness of the\ndifficulties, the smallness of the means intrusted him—would rouse a man\nof his disposition like a call to battle.  The lad introduced by marriage\nunder his roof was of a character to sympathise; the public usefulness of\nthe service would appeal to his judgment, the perpetual need for fresh\nexpedients stimulate his ingenuity.  And there was another attraction\nwhich, in the younger man at least, appealed to, and perhaps first\naroused, a profound and enduring sentiment of romance: I mean the\nattraction of the life.  The seas into which his labours carried the new\nengineer were still scarce charted, the coasts still dark; his way on\nshore was often far beyond the convenience of any road; the isles in\nwhich he must sojourn were still partly savage.  He must toss much in\nboats; he must often adventure on horseback by the dubious bridle-track\nthrough unfrequented wildernesses; he must sometimes plant his lighthouse\nin the very camp of wreckers; and he was continually enforced to the\nvicissitudes of outdoor life.  The joy of my grandfather in this career\nwas strong as the love of woman.  It lasted him through youth and\nmanhood, it burned strong in age, and at the approach of death his last\nyearning was to renew these loved experiences.  What he felt himself he\ncontinued to attribute to all around him.  And to this supposed sentiment\nin others I find him continually, almost pathetically, appealing; often\nin vain.\n\nSnared by these interests, the boy seems to have become almost at once\nthe eager confidant and adviser of his new connection; the Church, if he\nhad ever entertained the prospect very warmly, faded from his view; and\nat the age of nineteen I find him already in a post of some authority,\nsuperintending the construction of the lighthouse on the isle of Little\nCumbrae, in the Firth of Clyde.  The change of aim seems to have caused\nor been accompanied by a change of character.  It sounds absurd to couple\nthe name of my grandfather with the word indolence; but the lad who had\nbeen destined from the cradle to the Church, and who had attained the age\nof fifteen without acquiring more than a moderate knowledge of Latin, was\nat least no unusual student.  And from the day of his charge at Little\nCumbrae he steps before us what he remained until the end, a man of the\nmost zealous industry, greedy of occupation, greedy of knowledge, a stern\nhusband of time, a reader, a writer, unflagging in his task of\nself-improvement.  Thenceforward his summers were spent directing works\nand ruling workmen, now in uninhabited, now in half-savage islands; his\nwinters were set apart, first at the Andersonian Institution, then at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh to improve himself in mathematics, chemistry,\nnatural history, agriculture, moral philosophy, and logic; a bearded\nstudent—although no doubt scrupulously shaved.  I find one reference to\nhis years in class which will have a meaning for all who have studied in\nScottish Universities.  He mentions a recommendation made by the\nprofessor of logic.  ‘The high-school men,’ he writes, ‘and _bearded men\nlike myself_, were all attention.’  If my grandfather were throughout\nlife a thought too studious of the art of getting on, much must be\nforgiven to the bearded and belated student who looked across, with a\nsense of difference, at ‘the high-school men.’  Here was a gulf to be\ncrossed; but already he could feel that he had made a beginning, and that\nmust have been a proud hour when he devoted his earliest earnings to the\nrepayment of the charitable foundation in which he had received the\nrudiments of knowledge.\n\nIn yet another way he followed the example of his father-in-law, and from\n1794 to 1807, when the affairs of the Bell Rock made it necessary for him\nto resign, he served in different corps of volunteers.  In the last of\nthese he rose to a position of distinction, no less than captain of the\nGrenadier Company, and his colonel, in accepting his resignation,\nentreated he would do them ‘the favour of continuing as an honorary\nmember of a corps which has been so much indebted for your zeal and\nexertions.’\n\nTo very pious women the men of the house are apt to appear worldly.  The\nwife, as she puts on her new bonnet before church, is apt to sigh over\nthat assiduity which enabled her husband to pay the milliner’s bill.  And\nin the household of the Smiths and Stevensons the women were not only\nextremely pious, but the men were in reality a trifle worldly.  Religious\nthey both were; conscious, like all Scots, of the fragility and unreality\nof that scene in which we play our uncomprehended parts; like all Scots,\nrealising daily and hourly the sense of another will than ours and a\nperpetual direction in the affairs of life.  But the current of their\nendeavours flowed in a more obvious channel.  They had got on so far; to\nget on further was their next ambition—to gather wealth, to rise in\nsociety, to leave their descendants higher than themselves, to be (in\nsome sense) among the founders of families.  Scott was in the same town\nnourishing similar dreams.  But in the eyes of the women these dreams\nwould be foolish and idolatrous.\n\nI have before me some volumes of old letters addressed to Mrs. Smith and\nthe two girls, her favourites, which depict in a strong light their\ncharacters and the society in which they moved.\n\n    ‘My very dear and much esteemed Friend,’ writes one correspondent,\n    ‘this day being the anniversary of our acquaintance, I feel inclined\n    to address you; but where shall I find words to express the fealings\n    of a graitful _Heart_, first to the Lord who graiciously inclined you\n    on this day last year to notice an afflicted Strainger providentially\n    cast in your way far from any Earthly friend? . . .  Methinks I shall\n    hear him say unto you, “Inasmuch as ye shewed kindness to my\n    afflicted handmaiden, ye did it unto me.”’\n\nThis is to Jean; but the same afflicted lady wrote indifferently to Jean,\nto Janet, and to Ms. Smith, whom she calls ‘my Edinburgh mother.’  It is\nplain the three were as one person, moving to acts of kindness, like the\nGraces, inarmed.  Too much stress must not be laid on the style of this\ncorrespondence; Clarinda survived, not far away, and may have met the\nladies on the Calton Hill; and many of the writers appear, underneath the\nconventions of the period, to be genuinely moved.  But what unpleasantly\nstrikes a reader is, that these devout unfortunates found a revenue in\ntheir devotion.  It is everywhere the same tale; on the side of the\nsoft-hearted ladies, substantial acts of help; on the side of the\ncorrespondents, affection, italics, texts, ecstasies, and imperfect\nspelling.  When a midwife is recommended, not at all for proficiency in\nher important art, but because she has ‘a sister whom I [the\ncorrespondent] esteem and respect, and [who] is a spiritual daughter of\nmy Hond Father in the Gosple,’ the mask seems to be torn off, and the\nwages of godliness appear too openly.  Capacity is a secondary matter in\na midwife, temper in a servant, affection in a daughter, and the\nrepetition of a shibboleth fulfils the law.  Common decency is at times\nforgot in the same page with the most sanctified advice and aspiration.\nThus I am introduced to a correspondent who appears to have been at the\ntime the housekeeper at Invermay, and who writes to condole with my\ngrandmother in a season of distress.  For nearly half a sheet she keeps\nto the point with an excellent discretion in language then suddenly\nbreaks out:\n\n    ‘It was fully my intention to have left this at Martinmass, but the\n    Lord fixes the bounds of our habitation.  I have had more need of\n    patience in my situation here than in any other, partly from the very\n    violent, unsteady, deceitful temper of the Mistress of the Family,\n    and also from the state of the house.  It was in a train of repair\n    when I came here two years ago, and is still in Confusion.  There is\n    above six Thousand Pounds’ worth of Furniture come from London to be\n    put up when the rooms are completely finished; and then, woe be to\n    the Person who is Housekeeper at Invermay!’\n\nAnd by the tail of the document, which is torn, I see she goes on to ask\nthe bereaved family to seek her a new place.  It is extraordinary that\npeople should have been so deceived in so careless an impostor; that a\nfew sprinkled ‘God willings’ should have blinded them to the essence of\nthis venomous letter; and that they should have been at the pains to bind\nit in with others (many of them highly touching) in their memorial of\nharrowing days.  But the good ladies were without guile and without\nsuspicion; they were victims marked for the axe, and the religious\nimpostors snuffed up the wind as they drew near.\n\nI have referred above to my grandmother; it was no slip of the pen: for\nby an extraordinary arrangement, in which it is hard not to suspect the\nmanaging hand of a mother, Jean Smith became the wife of Robert\nStevenson.  Mrs. Smith had failed in her design to make her son a\nminister, and she saw him daily more immersed in business and worldly\nambition.  One thing remained that she might do: she might secure for him\na godly wife, that great means of sanctification; and she had two under\nher hand, trained by herself, her dear friends and daughters both in law\nand love—Jean and Janet.  Jean’s complexion was extremely pale, Janet’s\nwas florid; my grandmother’s nose was straight, my great-aunt’s aquiline;\nbut by the sound of the voice, not even a son was able to distinguish one\nfrom other.  The marriage of a man of twenty-seven and a girl of twenty\nwho have lived for twelve years as brother and sister, is difficult to\nconceive.  It took place, however, and thus in 1799 the family was still\nfurther cemented by the union of a representative of the male or worldly\nelement with one of the female and devout.\n\nThis essential difference remained unbridged, yet never diminished the\nstrength of their relation.  My grandfather pursued his design of\nadvancing in the world with some measure of success; rose to distinction\nin his calling, grew to be the familiar of members of Parliament, judges\nof the Court of Session, and ‘landed gentlemen’; learned a ready address,\nhad a flow of interesting conversation, and when he was referred to as ‘a\nhighly respectable _bourgeois_,’ resented the description.  My\ngrandmother remained to the end devout and unambitious, occupied with her\nBible, her children, and her house; easily shocked, and associating\nlargely with a clique of godly parasites.  I do not know if she called in\nthe midwife already referred to; but the principle on which that lady was\nrecommended, she accepted fully.  The cook was a godly woman, the butcher\na Christian man, and the table suffered.  The scene has been often\ndescribed to me of my grandfather sawing with darkened countenance at\nsome indissoluble joint—‘Preserve me, my dear, what kind of a reedy,\nstringy beast is this?’—of the joint removed, the pudding substituted and\nuncovered; and of my grandmother’s anxious glance and hasty, deprecatory\ncomment, ‘Just mismanaged!’  Yet with the invincible obstinacy of soft\nnatures, she would adhere to the godly woman and the Christian man, or\nfind others of the same kidney to replace them.  One of her confidants\nhad once a narrow escape; an unwieldy old woman, she had fallen from an\noutside stair in a close of the Old Town; and my grandmother rejoiced to\ncommunicate the providential circumstance that a baker had been passing\nunderneath with his bread upon his head.  ‘I would like to know what kind\nof providence the baker thought it!’ cried my grandfather.\n\nBut the sally must have been unique.  In all else that I have heard or\nread of him, so far from criticising, he was doing his utmost to honour\nand even to emulate his wife’s pronounced opinions.  In the only letter\nwhich has come to my hand of Thomas Smith’s, I find him informing his\nwife that he was ‘in time for afternoon church’; similar assurances or\ncognate excuses abound in the correspondence of Robert Stevenson; and it\nis comical and pretty to see the two generations paying the same court to\na female piety more highly strung: Thomas Smith to the mother of Robert\nStevenson—Robert Stevenson to the daughter of Thomas Smith.  And if for\nonce my grandfather suffered himself to be hurried, by his sense of\nhumour and justice, into that remark about the case of Providence and the\nBaker, I should be sorry for any of his children who should have stumbled\ninto the same attitude of criticism.  In the apocalyptic style of the\nhousekeeper of Invermay, woe be to that person!  But there was no fear;\nhusband and sons all entertained for the pious, tender soul the same\nchivalrous and moved affection.  I have spoken with one who remembered\nher, and who had been the intimate and equal of her sons, and I found\nthis witness had been struck, as I had been, with a sense of\ndisproportion between the warmth of the adoration felt and the nature of\nthe woman, whether as described or observed.  She diligently read and\nmarked her Bible; she was a tender nurse; she had a sense of humour under\nstrong control; she talked and found some amusement at her (or rather at\nher husband’s) dinner-parties.  It is conceivable that even my\ngrandmother was amenable to the seductions of dress; at least, I find her\nhusband inquiring anxiously about ‘the gowns from Glasgow,’ and very\ncareful to describe the toilet of the Princess Charlotte, whom he had\nseen in church ‘in a Pelisse and Bonnet of the same colour of cloth as\nthe Boys’ Dress jackets, trimmed with blue satin ribbons; the hat or\nBonnet, Mr. Spittal said, was a Parisian slouch, and had a plume of three\nwhite feathers.’  But all this leaves a blank impression, and it is\nrather by reading backward in these old musty letters, which have moved\nme now to laughter and now to impatience, that I glean occasional\nglimpses of how she seemed to her contemporaries, and trace (at work in\nher queer world of godly and grateful parasites) a mobile and responsive\nnature.  Fashion moulds us, and particularly women, deeper than we\nsometimes think; but a little while ago, and, in some circles, women\nstood or fell by the degree of their appreciation of old pictures; in the\nearly years of the century (and surely with more reason) a character like\nthat of my grandmother warmed, charmed, and subdued, like a strain of\nmusic, the hearts of the men of her own household.  And there is little\ndoubt that Mrs. Smith, as she looked on at the domestic life of her son\nand her stepdaughter, and numbered the heads in their increasing nursery,\nmust have breathed fervent thanks to her Creator.\n\nYet this was to be a family unusually tried; it was not for nothing that\none of the godly women saluted Miss Janet Smith as ‘a veteran in\naffliction’; and they were all before middle life experienced in that\nform of service.  By the 1st of January 1808, besides a pair of\nstill-born twins, children had been born and still survived to the young\ncouple.  By the 11th two were gone; by the 28th a third had followed, and\nthe two others were still in danger.  In the letters of a former\nnurserymaid—I give her name, Jean Mitchell, _honoris causa_—we are\nenabled to feel, even at this distance of time, some of the bitterness of\nthat month of bereavement.\n\n    ‘I have this day received,’ she writes to Miss Janet, ‘the melancholy\n    news of my dear babys’ deaths.  My heart is like to break for my dear\n    Mrs. Stevenson.  O may she be supported on this trying occasion!  I\n    hope her other three babys will be spared to her.  O, Miss Smith, did\n    I think when I parted from my sweet babys that I never was to see\n    them more?’  ‘I received,’ she begins her next, ‘the mournful news of\n    my dear Jessie’s death.  I also received the hair of my three sweet\n    babys, which I will preserve as dear to their memorys and as a token\n    of Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson’s friendship and esteem.  At my leisure\n    hours, when the children are in bed, they occupy all my thoughts, I\n    dream of them.  About two weeks ago I dreamed that my sweet little\n    Jessie came running to me in her usual way, and I took her in my\n    arms.  O my dear babys, were mortal eyes permitted to see them in\n    heaven, we would not repine nor grieve for their loss.’\n\nBy the 29th of February, the Reverend John Campbell, a man of obvious\nsense and human value, but hateful to the present biographer, because he\nwrote so many letters and conveyed so little information, summed up this\nfirst period of affliction in a letter to Miss Smith: ‘Your dear sister\nbut a little while ago had a full nursery, and the dear blooming\ncreatures sitting around her table filled her breast with hope that one\nday they should fill active stations in society and become an ornament in\nthe Church below.  But ah!’\n\nNear a hundred years ago these little creatures ceased to be, and for not\nmuch less a period the tears have been dried.  And to this day, looking\nin these stitched sheaves of letters, we hear the sound of many\nsoft-hearted women sobbing for the lost.  Never was such a massacre of\nthe innocents; teething and chincough and scarlet fever and smallpox ran\nthe round; and little Lillies, and Smiths, and Stevensons fell like moths\nabout a candle; and nearly all the sympathetic correspondents deplore and\nrecall the little losses of their own.  ‘It is impossible to describe the\nHeavnly looks of the Dear Babe the three last days of his life,’ writes\nMrs. Laurie to Mrs. Smith.  ‘Never—never, my dear aunt, could I wish to\neface the rememberance of this Dear Child.  Never, never, my dear aunt!’\nAnd so soon the memory of the dead and the dust of the survivors are\nburied in one grave.\n\nThere was another death in 1812; it passes almost unremarked; a single\nfuneral seemed but a small event to these ‘veterans in affliction’; and\nby 1816 the nursery was full again.  Seven little hopefuls enlivened the\nhouse; some were growing up; to the elder girl my grandfather already\nwrote notes in current hand at the tail of his letters to his wife: and\nto the elder boys he had begun to print, with laborious care, sheets of\nchildish gossip and pedantic applications.  Here, for instance, under\ndate of 26th May 1816, is part of a mythological account of London, with\na moral for the three gentlemen, ‘Messieurs Alan, Robert, and James\nStevenson,’ to whom the document is addressed:\n\n    ‘There are many prisons here like Bridewell, for, like other large\n    towns, there are many bad men here as well as many good men.  The\n    natives of London are in general not so tall and strong as the people\n    of Edinburgh, because they have not so much pure air, and instead of\n    taking porridge they eat cakes made with sugar and plums.  Here you\n    have thousands of carts to draw timber, thousands of coaches to take\n    you to all parts of the town, and thousands of boats to sail on the\n    river Thames.  But you must have money to pay, otherwise you can get\n    nothing.  Now the way to get money is, become clever men and men of\n    education, by being good scholars.’\n\nFrom the same absence, he writes to his wife on a Sunday:\n\n    ‘It is now about eight o’clock with me, and I imagine you to be busy\n    with the young folks, hearing the questions [_Anglicé_, catechism],\n    and indulging the boys with a chapter from the large Bible, with\n    their interrogations and your answers in the soundest doctrine.  I\n    hope James is getting his verse as usual, and that Mary is not\n    forgetting her little _hymn_.  While Jeannie will be reading\n    Wotherspoon, or some other suitable and instructive book, I presume\n    our friend, Aunt Mary, will have just arrived with the news of _a\n    throng kirk_ [a crowded church] and a great sermon.  You may mention,\n    with my compliments to my mother, that I was at St. Paul’s to-day,\n    and attended a very excellent service with Mr. James Lawrie.  The\n    text was “Examine and see that ye be in the faith.”’\n\nA twinkle of humour lights up this evocation of the distant scene—the\nhumour of happy men and happy homes.  Yet it is penned upon the threshold\nof fresh sorrow.  James and Mary—he of the verse and she of the hymn—did\nnot much more than survive to welcome their returning father.  On the\n25th, one of the godly women writes to Janet:\n\n    ‘My dearest beloved madam, when I last parted from you, you was so\n    affected with your affliction [you? or I?] could think of nothing\n    else.  But on Saturday, when I went to inquire after your health, how\n    was I startled to hear that dear James was gone!  Ah, what is this?\n    My dear benefactors, doing so much good to many, to the Lord,\n    suddenly to be deprived of their most valued comforts!  I was thrown\n    into great perplexity, could do nothing but murmur, why these things\n    were done to such a family.  I could not rest, but at midnight,\n    whether spoken [or not] it was presented to my mind—“Those whom ye\n    deplore are walking with me in white.”  I conclude from this the Lord\n    saying to sweet Mrs. Stevenson: “I gave them to be brought up for me:\n    well done, good and faithful! they are fully prepared, and now I must\n    present them to my father and your father, to my God and your God.”’\n\nIt would be hard to lay on flattery with a more sure and daring hand.  I\nquote it as a model of a letter of condolence; be sure it would console.\nVery different, perhaps quite as welcome, is this from a lighthouse\ninspector to my grandfather:\n\n    ‘In reading your letter the trickling tear ran down ray cheeks in\n    silent sorrow for your departed dear ones, my sweet little friends.\n    Well do I remember, and you will call to mind, their little innocent\n    and interesting stories.  Often have they come round me and taken me\n    by the hand, but alas!  I am no more destined to behold them.’\n\nThe child who is taken becomes canonised, and the looks of the homeliest\nbabe seem in the retrospect ‘heavenly the three last days of his life.’\nBut it appears that James and Mary had indeed been children more than\nusually engaging; a record was preserved a long while in the family of\ntheir remarks and ‘little innocent and interesting stories,’ and the blow\nand the blank were the more sensible.\n\nEarly the next month Robert Stevenson must proceed upon his voyage of\ninspection, part by land, part by sea.  He left his wife plunged in low\nspirits; the thought of his loss, and still more of her concern, was\ncontinually present in his mind, and he draws in his letters home an\ninteresting picture of his family relations:\n\n                      ‘_Windygates Inn_, _Monday_ (_Postmark July_ 16_th_)\n\n    ‘MY DEAREST JEANNIE,—While the people of the inn are getting me a\n    little bit of something to eat, I sit down to tell you that I had a\n    most excellent passage across the water, and got to Wemyss at\n    mid-day.  I hope the children will be very good, and that Robert will\n    take a course with you to learn his Latin lessons daily; he may,\n    however, read English in company.  Let them have strawberries on\n    Saturdays.’\n\n                                              ‘_Westhaven_, 17_th_ _July_.\n\n    ‘I have been occupied to-day at the harbour of Newport, opposite\n    Dundee, and am this far on my way to Arbroath.  You may tell the boys\n    that I slept last night in Mr. Steadman’s tent.  I found my bed\n    rather hard, but the lodgings were otherwise extremely comfortable.\n    The encampment is on the Fife side of the Tay, immediately opposite\n    to Dundee.  From the door of the tent you command the most beautiful\n    view of the Firth, both up and down, to a great extent.  At night all\n    was serene and still, the sky presented the most beautiful appearance\n    of bright stars, and the morning was ushered in with the song of many\n    little birds.’\n\n                                               ‘_Aberdeen_, _July_ 19_th_.\n\n    ‘I hope, my dear, that you are going out of doors regularly and\n    taking much exercise.  I would have you to _make the markets\n    daily_—and by all means to take a seat in the coach once or twice in\n    the week and see what is going on in town.  [The family were at the\n    sea-side.]  It will be good not to be too great a stranger to the\n    house.  It will be rather painful at first, but as it is to be done,\n    I would have you not to be too strange to the house in town.\n\n    ‘Tell the boys that I fell in with a soldier—his name is\n    Henderson—who was twelve years with Lord Wellington and other\n    commanders.  He returned very lately with only eightpence-halfpenny\n    in his pocket, and found his father and mother both in life, though\n    they had never heard from him, nor he from them.  He carried my\n    great-coat and umbrella a few miles.’\n\n                                            ‘_Fraserburgh_, _July_ 20_th_.\n\n    ‘Fraserburgh is the same dull place which [Auntie] Mary and Jeannie\n    found it.  As I am travelling along the coast which they are\n    acquainted with, you had better cause Robert bring down the map from\n    Edinburgh; and it will be a good exercise in geography for the young\n    folks to trace my course.  I hope they have entered upon the writing.\n    The library will afford abundance of excellent books, which I wish\n    you would employ a little.  I hope you are doing me the favour to go\n    much out with the boys, which will do you much good and prevent them\n    from getting so very much overheated.’\n\n                         [_To the Boys—Printed_.]\n\n    ‘When I had last the pleasure of writing to you, your dear little\n    brother James and your sweet little sister Mary were still with us.\n    But it has pleased God to remove them to another and a better world,\n    and we must submit to the will of Providence.  I must, however,\n    request of you to think sometimes upon them, and to be very careful\n    not to do anything that will displease or vex your mother.  It is\n    therefore proper that you do not roamp [Scottish indeed] too much\n    about, and that you learn your lessons.’\n\n    ‘I went to Fraserburgh and visited Kinnaird Head Lighthouse, which I\n    found in good order.  All this time I travelled upon good roads, and\n    paid many a toll-man by the way; but from Fraserburgh to Banff there\n    is no toll-bars, and the road is so bad that I had to walk up and\n    down many a hill, and for want of bridges the horses had to drag the\n    chaise up to the middle of the wheels in water.  At Banff I saw a\n    large ship of 300 tons lying on the sands upon her beam-ends, and a\n    wreck for want of a good harbour.  Captain Wilson—to whom I beg my\n    compliments—will show you a ship of 300 tons.  At the towns of\n    Macduff, Banff, and Portsoy, many of the houses are built of marble,\n    and the rocks on this part of the coast or sea-side are marble.  But,\n    my dear Boys, unless marble be polished and dressed, it is a very\n    coarse-looking stone, and has no more beauty than common rock.  As a\n    proof of this, ask the favour of your mother to take you to Thomson’s\n    Marble Works in South Leith, and you will see marble in all its\n    stages, and perhaps you may there find Portsoy marble!  The use I\n    wish to make of this is to tell you that, without education, a man is\n    just like a block of rough, unpolished marble.  Notice, in proof of\n    this, how much Mr. Neill and Mr. M’Gregor [the tutor] know, and\n    observe how little a man knows who is not a good scholar.  On my way\n    to Fochabers I passed through many thousand acres of Fir timber, and\n    saw many deer running in these woods.’\n\n                            [_To Mrs. Stevenson_.]\n\n                                              ‘_Inverness_, _July_ 21_st_.\n\n    ‘I propose going to church in the afternoon, and as I have\n    breakfasted late, I shall afterwards take a walk, and dine about six\n    o’clock.  I do not know who is the clergyman here, but I shall think\n    of you all.  I travelled in the mail-coach [from Banff] almost alone.\n    While it was daylight I kept the top, and the passing along a country\n    I had never before seen was a considerable amusement.  But, my dear,\n    you are all much in my thoughts, and many are the objects which\n    recall the recollection of our tender and engaging children we have\n    so recently lost.  We must not, however, repine.  I could not for a\n    moment wish any change of circumstances in their case; and in every\n    comparative view of their state, I see the Lord’s goodness in\n    removing them from an evil world to an abode of bliss; and I must\n    earnestly hope that you may be enabled to take such a view of this\n    affliction as to live in the happy prospect of our all meeting again\n    to part no more—and that under such considerations you are getting up\n    your spirits.  I wish you would walk about, and by all means go to\n    town, and do not sit much at home.’\n\n                                              ‘_Inverness_, _July_ 23_rd_.\n\n    ‘I am duly favoured with your much-valued letter, and I am happy to\n    find that you are so much with my mother, because that sort of\n    variety has a tendency to occupy the mind, and to keep it from\n    brooding too much upon one subject.  Sensibility and tenderness are\n    certainly two of the most interesting and pleasing qualities of the\n    mind.  These qualities are also none of the least of the many\n    endearingments of the female character.  But if that kind of sympathy\n    and pleasing melancholy, which is familiar to us under distress, be\n    much indulged, it becomes habitual, and takes such a hold of the mind\n    as to absorb all the other affections, and unfit us for the duties\n    and proper enjoyments of life.  Resignation sinks into a kind of\n    peevish discontent.  I am far, however, from thinking there is the\n    least danger of this in your case, my dear; for you have been on all\n    occasions enabled to look upon the fortunes of this life as under the\n    direction of a higher power, and have always preserved that propriety\n    and consistency of conduct in all circumstances which endears your\n    example to your family in particular, and to your friends.  I am\n    therefore, my dear, for you to go out much, and to go to the house\n    up-stairs [he means to go up-stairs in the house, to visit the place\n    of the dead children], and to put yourself in the way of the visits\n    of your friends.  I wish you would call on the Miss Grays, and it\n    would be a good thing upon a Saturday to dine with my mother, and\n    take Meggy and all the family with you, and let them have their\n    strawberries in town.  The tickets of one of the _old-fashioned\n    coaches_ would take you all up, and if the evening were good, they\n    could all walk down, excepting Meggy and little David.’\n\n                                    ‘_Inverness_, _July_ 25_th_, 11 _p.m._\n\n    ‘Captain Wemyss, of Wemyss, has come to Inverness to go the voyage\n    with me, and as we are sleeping in a double-bedded room, I must no\n    longer transgress.  You must remember me the best way you can to the\n    children.’\n\n                       ‘_On board of the Lighthouse Yacht_, _July_ 29_th_.\n\n    ‘I got to Cromarty yesterday about mid-day, and went to church.  It\n    happened to be the sacrament there, and I heard a Mr. Smith at that\n    place conclude the service with a very suitable exhortation.  There\n    seemed a great concourse of people, but they had rather an\n    unfortunate day for them at the tent, as it rained a good deal.\n    After drinking tea at the inn, Captain Wemyss accompanied me on\n    board, and we sailed about eight last night.  The wind at present\n    being rather a beating one, I think I shall have an opportunity of\n    standing into the bay of Wick, and leaving this letter to let you\n    know my progress and that I am well.’\n\n                         ‘_Lighthouse Yacht_, _Stornoway_, _August_ 4_th_.\n\n    ‘To-day we had prayers on deck as usual when at sea.  I read the 14th\n    chapter, I think, of Job.  Captain Wemyss has been in the habit of\n    doing this on board his own ship, agreeably to the Articles of War.\n    Our passage round the Cape [Cape Wrath] was rather a cross one, and\n    as the wind was northerly, we had a pretty heavy sea, but upon the\n    whole have made a good passage, leaving many vessels behind us in\n    Orkney.  I am quite well, my dear; and Captain Wemyss, who has much\n    spirit, and who is much given to observation, and a perfect\n    enthusiast in his profession, enlivens the voyage greatly.  Let me\n    entreat you to move about much, and take a walk with the boys to\n    Leith.  I think they have still many places to see there, and I wish\n    you would indulge them in this respect.  Mr. Scales is the best\n    person I know for showing them the sailcloth-weaving, etc., and he\n    would have great pleasure in undertaking this.  My dear, I trust soon\n    to be with you, and that through the goodness of God we shall meet\n    all well.’\n\n    ‘There are two vessels lying here with emigrants for America, each\n    with eighty people on board, at all ages, from a few days to upwards\n    of sixty!

This has, upon the whole, been a\n    very good voyage, and Captain Wemyss, who enjoys it much, has been an\n    excellent companion; we met with pleasure, and shall part with\n    regret.’\n\nStrange that, after his long experience, my grandfather should have\nlearned so little of the attitude and even the dialect of the\nspiritually-minded; that after forty-four years in a most religious\ncircle, he could drop without sense of incongruity from a period of\naccepted phrases to ‘trust his wife was _getting up her spirits_,’ or\nthink to reassure her as to the character of Captain Wemyss by mentioning\nthat he had read prayers on the deck of his frigate ‘_agreeably to the\nArticles of War_’!  Yet there is no doubt—and it is one of the most\nagreeable features of the kindly series—that he was doing his best to\nplease, and there is little doubt that he succeeded.  Almost all my\ngrandfather’s private letters have been destroyed.  This correspondence\nhas not only been preserved entire, but stitched up in the same covers\nwith the works of the godly women, the Reverend John Campbell, and the\npainful Mrs. Ogle.  I did not think to mention the good dame, but she\ncomes in usefully as an example.  Amongst the treasures of the ladies of\nmy family, her letters have been honoured with a volume to themselves.  I\nread about a half of them myself; then handed over the task to one of\nstauncher resolution, with orders to communicate any fact that should be\nfound to illuminate these pages.  Not one was found; it was her only art\nto communicate by post second-rate sermons at second-hand; and such, I\ntake it, was the correspondence in which my grandmother delighted.  If I\nam right, that of Robert Stevenson, with his quaint smack of the\ncontemporary ‘Sandford and Merton,’ his interest in the whole page of\nexperience, his perpetual quest, and fine scent of all that seems\nromantic to a boy, his needless pomp of language, his excellent good\nsense, his unfeigned, unstained, unwearied human kindliness, would seem\nto her, in a comparison, dry and trivial and worldly.  And if these\nletters were by an exception cherished and preserved, it would be for one\nor both of two reasons—because they dealt with and were bitter-sweet\nreminders of a time of sorrow; or because she was pleased, perhaps\ntouched, by the writer’s guileless efforts to seem spiritually-minded.\n\nAfter this date there were two more births and two more deaths, so that\nthe number of the family remained unchanged; in all five children\nsurvived to reach maturity and to outlive their parents.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II: THE SERVICE OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS\n\n\nI\n\n\nIt were hard to imagine a contrast more sharply defined than that between\nthe lives of the men and women of this family: the one so chambered, so\ncentred in the affections and the sensibilities; the other so active,\nhealthy, and expeditious.  From May to November, Thomas Smith and Robert\nStevenson were on the mail, in the saddle, or at sea; and my grandfather,\nin particular, seems to have been possessed with a demon of activity in\ntravel.  In 1802, by direction of the Northern Lighthouse Board, he had\nvisited the coast of England from St. Bees, in Cumberland, and round by\nthe Scilly Islands to some place undecipherable by me; in all a distance\nof 2500 miles.  In 1806 I find him starting ‘on a tour round the south\ncoast of England, from the Humber to the Severn.’  Peace was not long\ndeclared ere he found means to visit Holland, where he was in time to\nsee, in the navy-yard at Helvoetsluys, ‘about twenty of Bonaparte’s\n_English flotilla_ lying in a state of decay, the object of curiosity to\nEnglishmen.’  By 1834 he seems to have been acquainted with the coast of\nFrance from Dieppe to Bordeaux; and a main part of his duty as Engineer\nto the Board of Northern Lights was one round of dangerous and laborious\ntravel.\n\nIn 1786, when Thomas Smith first received the appointment, the extended\nand formidable coast of Scotland was lighted at a single point—the Isle\nof May, in the jaws of the Firth of Forth, where, on a tower already a\nhundred and fifty years old, an open coal-fire blazed in an iron\nchauffer.  The whole archipelago, thus nightly plunged in darkness, was\nshunned by sea-going vessels, and the favourite courses were north about\nShetland and west about St. Kilda.  When the Board met, four new lights\nformed the extent of their intentions—Kinnaird Head, in Aberdeenshire, at\nthe eastern elbow of the coast; North Ronaldsay, in Orkney, to keep the\nnorth and guide ships passing to the south’ard of Shetland; Island Glass,\non Harris, to mark the inner shore of the Hebrides and illuminate the\nnavigation of the Minch; and the Mull of Kintyre.  These works were to be\nattempted against obstacles, material and financial, that might have\nstaggered the most bold.  Smith had no ship at his command till 1791; the\nroads in those outlandish quarters where his business lay were scarce\npassable when they existed, and the tower on the Mull of Kintyre stood\neleven months unlighted while the apparatus toiled and foundered by the\nway among rocks and mosses.  Not only had towers to be built and\napparatus transplanted; the supply of oil must be maintained, and the men\nfed, in the same inaccessible and distant scenes; a whole service, with\nits routine and hierarchy, had to be called out of nothing; and a new\ntrade (that of lightkeeper) to be taught, recruited, and organised.  The\nfunds of the Board were at the first laughably inadequate.  They embarked\non their career on a loan of twelve hundred pounds, and their income in\n1789, after relief by a fresh Act of Parliament, amounted to less than\nthree hundred.  It must be supposed that the thoughts of Thomas Smith, in\nthese early years, were sometimes coloured with despair; and since he\nbuilt and lighted one tower after another, and created and bequeathed to\nhis successors the elements of an excellent administration, it may be\nconceded that he was not after all an unfortunate choice for a first\nengineer.\n\nWar added fresh complications.  In 1794 Smith came ‘very near to be\ntaken’ by a French squadron.  In 1813 Robert Stevenson was cruising about\nthe neighbourhood of Cape Wrath in the immediate fear of Commodore\nRogers.  The men, and especially the sailors, of the lighthouse service\nmust be protected by a medal and ticket from the brutal activity of the\npress-gang.  And the zeal of volunteer patriots was at times\nembarrassing.\n\n    ‘I set off on foot,’ writes my grandfather, ‘for Marazion, a town at\n    the head of Mount’s Bay, where I was in hopes of getting a boat to\n    freight.  I had just got that length, and was making the necessary\n    inquiry, when a young man, accompanied by several idle-looking\n    fellows, came up to me, and in a hasty tone said, “Sir, in the king’s\n    name I seize your person and papers.”  To which I replied that I\n    should be glad to see his authority, and know the reason of an\n    address so abrupt.  He told me the want of time prevented his taking\n    regular steps, but that it would be necessary for me to return to\n    Penzance, as I was suspected of being a French spy.  I proposed to\n    submit my papers to the nearest Justice of Peace, who was immediately\n    applied to, and came to the inn where I was.  He seemed to be greatly\n    agitated, and quite at a loss how to proceed.  The complaint\n    preferred against me was “that I had examined the Longships\n    Lighthouse with the most minute attention, and was no less particular\n    in my inquiries at the keepers of the lighthouse regarding the sunk\n    rocks lying off the Land’s End, with the sets of the currents and\n    tides along the coast: that I seemed particularly to regret the\n    situation of the rocks called the Seven Stones, and the loss of a\n    beacon which the Trinity Board had caused to be fixed on the Wolf\n    Rock; that I had taken notes of the bearings of several sunk rocks,\n    and a drawing of the lighthouse, and of Cape Cornwall.  Further, that\n    I had refused the honour of Lord Edgecombe’s invitation to dinner,\n    offering as an apology that I had some particular business on hand.”’\n\nMy grandfather produced in answer his credentials and letter of credit;\nbut the justice, after perusing them, ‘very gravely observed that they\nwere “musty bits of paper,”’ and proposed to maintain the arrest.  Some\nmore enlightened magistrates at Penzance relieved him of suspicion and\nleft him at liberty to pursue his journey,—‘which I did with so much\neagerness,’ he adds, ‘that I gave the two coal lights on the Lizard only\na very transient look.’\n\nLighthouse operations in Scotland differed essentially in character from\nthose in England.  The English coast is in comparison a habitable, homely\nplace, well supplied with towns; the Scottish presents hundreds of miles\nof savage islands and desolate moors.  The Parliamentary committee of\n1834, profoundly ignorant of this distinction, insisted with my\ngrandfather that the work at the various stations should be let out on\ncontract ‘in the neighbourhood,’ where sheep and deer, and gulls and\ncormorants, and a few ragged gillies, perhaps crouching in a bee-hive\nhouse, made up the only neighbours.  In such situations repairs and\nimprovements could only be overtaken by collecting (as my grandfather\nexpressed it) a few ‘lads,’ placing them under charge of a foreman, and\ndespatching them about the coast as occasion served.  The particular\ndanger of these seas increased the difficulty.  The course of the\nlighthouse tender lies amid iron-bound coasts, among tide-races, the\nwhirlpools of the Pentland Firth, flocks of islands, flocks of reefs,\nmany of them uncharted.  The aid of steam was not yet.  At first in\nrandom coasting sloop, and afterwards in the cutter belonging to the\nservice, the engineer must ply and run amongst these multiplied dangers,\nand sometimes late into the stormy autumn.  For pages together my\ngrandfather’s diary preserves a record of these rude experiences; of hard\nwinds and rough seas; and of ‘the try-sail and storm-jib, those old\nfriends which I never like to see.’  They do not tempt to quotation, but\nit was the man’s element, in which he lived, and delighted to live, and\nsome specimen must be presented.  On Friday, September 10th, 1830, the\n_Regent_ lying in Lerwick Bay, we have this entry: ‘The gale increases,\nwith continued rain.’  On the morrow, Saturday, 11th, the weather\nappeared to moderate, and they put to sea, only to be driven by evening\ninto Levenswick.  There they lay, ‘rolling much,’ with both anchors ahead\nand the square yard on deck, till the morning of Saturday, 18th.\nSaturday and Sunday they were plying to the southward with a ‘strong\nbreeze and a heavy sea,’ and on Sunday evening anchored in Otterswick.\n‘Monday, 20th, it blows so fresh that we have no communication with the\nshore.  We see Mr. Rome on the beach, but we cannot communicate with him.\nIt blows “mere fire,” as the sailors express it.’  And for three days\nmore the diary goes on with tales of davits unshipped, high seas, strong\ngales from the southward, and the ship driven to refuge in Kirkwall or\nDeer Sound.  I have many a passage before me to transcribe, in which my\ngrandfather draws himself as a man of minute and anxious exactitude about\ndetails.  It must not be forgotten that these voyages in the tender were\nthe particular pleasure and reward of his existence; that he had in him a\nreserve of romance which carried him delightedly over these hardships and\nperils; that to him it was ‘great gain’ to be eight nights and seven days\nin the savage bay of Levenswick—to read a book in the much agitated\ncabin—to go on deck and hear the gale scream in his ears, and see the\nlandscape dark with rain and the ship plunge at her two anchors—and to\nturn in at night and wake again at morning, in his narrow berth, to the\nglamorous and continued voices of the gale.\n\nHis perils and escapes were beyond counting.  I shall only refer to two:\nthe first, because of the impression made upon himself; the second, from\nthe incidental picture it presents of the north islanders.  On the 9th\nOctober 1794 he took passage from Orkney in the sloop _Elizabeth_ of\nStromness.  She made a fair passage till within view of Kinnaird Head,\nwhere, as she was becalmed some three miles in the offing, and wind\nseemed to threaten from the south-east, the captain landed him, to\ncontinue his journey more expeditiously ashore.  A gale immediately\nfollowed, and the _Elizabeth_ was driven back to Orkney and lost with all\nhands.  The second escape I have been in the habit of hearing related by\nan eye-witness, my own father, from the earliest days of childhood.  On a\nSeptember night, the _Regent_ lay in the Pentland Firth in a fog and a\nviolent and windless swell.  It was still dark, when they were alarmed by\nthe sound of breakers, and an anchor was immediately let go.  The peep of\ndawn discovered them swinging in desperate proximity to the Isle of Swona\n{54a} and the surf bursting close under their stern.  There was in this\nplace a hamlet of the inhabitants, fisher-folk and wreckers; their huts\nstood close about the head of the beach.  All slept; the doors were\nclosed, and there was no smoke, and the anxious watchers on board ship\nseemed to contemplate a village of the dead.  It was thought possible to\nlaunch a boat and tow the _Regent_ from her place of danger; and with\nthis view a signal of distress was made and a gun fired with a red-hot\npoker from the galley.  Its detonation awoke the sleepers.  Door after\ndoor was opened, and in the grey light of the morning fisher after fisher\nwas seen to come forth, yawning and stretching himself, nightcap on head.\nFisher after fisher, I wrote, and my pen tripped; for it should rather\nstand wrecker after wrecker.  There was no emotion, no animation, it\nscarce seemed any interest; not a hand was raised; but all callously\nawaited the harvest of the sea, and their children stood by their side\nand waited also.  To the end of his life, my father remembered that\namphitheatre of placid spectators on the beach; and with a special and\nnatural animosity, the boys of his own age.  But presently a light air\nsprang up, and filled the sails, and fainted, and filled them again; and\nlittle by little the _Regent_ fetched way against the swell, and clawed\noff shore into the turbulent firth.\n\nThe purpose of these voyages was to effect a landing on open beaches or\namong shelving rocks, not for persons only, but for coals and food, and\nthe fragile furniture of light-rooms.  It was often impossible.  In 1831\nI find my grandfather ‘hovering for a week’ about the Pentland Skerries\nfor a chance to land; and it was almost always difficult.  Much knack and\nenterprise were early developed among the seamen of the service; their\nmanagement of boats is to this day a matter of admiration; and I find my\ngrandfather in his diary depicting the nature of their excellence in one\nhappily descriptive phrase, when he remarks that Captain Soutar had\nlanded ‘the small stores and nine casks of oil _with all the activity of\na smuggler_.’  And it was one thing to land, another to get on board\nagain.  I have here a passage from the diary, where it seems to have been\ntouch-and-go.  ‘I landed at Tarbetness, on the eastern side of the point,\nin a _mere gale or blast of wind_ from west-south-west, at 2 p.m.  It\nblew so fresh that the captain, in a kind of despair, went off to the\nship, leaving myself and the steward ashore.  While I was in the\nlight-room, I felt it shaking and waving, not with the tremor of the Bell\nRock, but with the _waving of a tree_!  This the light-keepers seemed to\nbe quite familiar to, the principal keeper remarking that “it was very\npleasant,” perhaps meaning interesting or curious.  The captain worked\nthe vessel into smooth water with admirable dexterity, and I got on board\nagain about 6 p.m. from the other side of the point.’  But not even the\ndexterity of Soutar could prevail always; and my grandfather must at\ntimes have been left in strange berths and with but rude provision.  I\nmay instance the case of my father, who was storm-bound three days upon\nan islet, sleeping in the uncemented and unchimneyed houses of the\nislanders, and subsisting on a diet of nettle-soup and lobsters.\n\nThe name of Soutar has twice escaped my pen, and I feel I owe him a\nvignette.  Soutar first attracted notice as mate of a praam at the Bell\nRock, and rose gradually to be captain of the _Regent_.  He was active,\nadmirably skilled in his trade, and a man incapable of fear.  Once, in\nLondon, he fell among a gang of confidence-men, naturally deceived by his\nrusticity and his prodigious accent.  They plied him with drink—a\nhopeless enterprise, for Soutar could not be made drunk; they proposed\ncards, and Soutar would not play.  At last, one of them, regarding him\nwith a formidable countenance, inquired if he were not frightened?  ‘I’m\nno’ very easy fleyed,’ replied the captain.  And the rooks withdrew after\nsome easier pigeon.  So many perils shared, and the partial familiarity\nof so many voyages, had given this man a stronghold in my grandfather’s\nestimation; and there is no doubt but he had the art to court and please\nhim with much hypocritical skill.  He usually dined on Sundays in the\ncabin.  He used to come down daily after dinner for a glass of port or\nwhisky, often in his full rig of sou’-wester, oilskins, and long boots;\nand I have often heard it described how insinuatingly he carried himself\non these appearances, artfully combining the extreme of deference with a\nblunt and seamanlike demeanour.  My father and uncles, with the devilish\npenetration of the boy, were far from being deceived; and my father,\nindeed, was favoured with an object-lesson not to be mistaken.  He had\ncrept one rainy night into an apple-barrel on deck, and from this place\nof ambush overheard Soutar and a comrade conversing in their oilskins.\nThe smooth sycophant of the cabin had wholly disappeared, and the boy\nlistened with wonder to a vulgar and truculent ruffian.  Of Soutar, I may\nsay _tantum vidi_, having met him in the Leith docks now more than thirty\nyears ago, when he abounded in the praises of my grandfather, encouraged\nme (in the most admirable manner) to pursue his footprints, and left\nimpressed for ever on my memory the image of his own Bardolphian nose.\nHe died not long after.\n\nThe engineer was not only exposed to the hazards of the sea; he must\noften ford his way by land to remote and scarce accessible places, beyond\nreach of the mail or the post-chaise, beyond even the tracery of the\nbridle-path, and guided by natives across bog and heather.  Up to 1807 my\ngrand-father seems to have travelled much on horseback; but he then gave\nup the idea—‘such,’ he writes with characteristic emphasis and capital\nletters, ‘is the Plague of Baiting.’  He was a good pedestrian; at the\nage of fifty-eight I find him covering seventeen miles over the moors of\nthe Mackay country in less than seven hours, and that is not bad\ntravelling for a scramble.  The piece of country traversed was already a\nfamiliar track, being that between Loch Eriboll and Cape Wrath; and I\nthink I can scarce do better than reproduce from the diary some traits of\nhis first visit.  The tender lay in Loch Eriboll; by five in the morning\nthey sat down to breakfast on board; by six they were ashore—my\ngrandfather, Mr. Slight an assistant, and Soutar of the jolly nose, and\nhad been taken in charge by two young gentlemen of the neighbourhood and\na pair of gillies.  About noon they reached the Kyle of Durness and\npassed the ferry.  By half-past three they were at Cape Wrath—not yet\nknown by the emphatic abbreviation of ‘The Cape’—and beheld upon all\nsides of them unfrequented shores, an expanse of desert moor, and the\nhigh-piled Western Ocean.  The site of the tower was chosen.  Perhaps it\nis by inheritance of blood, but I know few things more inspiriting than\nthis location of a lighthouse in a designated space of heather and air,\nthrough which the sea-birds are still flying.  By 9 p.m. the return\njourney had brought them again to the shores of the Kyle.  The night was\ndirty, and as the sea was high and the ferry-boat small, Soutar and Mr.\nStevenson were left on the far side, while the rest of the party embarked\nand were received into the darkness.  They made, in fact, a safe though\nan alarming passage; but the ferryman refused to repeat the adventure;\nand my grand-father and the captain long paced the beach, impatient for\ntheir turn to pass, and tormented with rising anxiety as to the fate of\ntheir companions.  At length they sought the shelter of a shepherd’s\nhouse.  ‘We had miserable up-putting,’ the diary continues, ‘and on both\nsides of the ferry much anxiety of mind.  Our beds were clean straw, and\nbut for the circumstance of the boat, I should have slept as soundly as\never I did after a walk through moss and mire of sixteen hours.’\n\nTo go round the lights, even to-day, is to visit past centuries.  The\ntide of tourists that flows yearly in Scotland, vulgarising all where it\napproaches, is still defined by certain barriers.  It will be long ere\nthere is a hotel at Sumburgh or a hydropathic at Cape Wrath; it will be\nlong ere any _char-à-banc_, laden with tourists, shall drive up to Barra\nHead or Monach, the Island of the Monks.  They are farther from London\nthan St. Petersburg, and except for the towers, sounding and shining all\nnight with fog-bells and the radiance of the light-room, glittering by\nday with the trivial brightness of white paint, these island and moorland\nstations seem inaccessible to the civilisation of to-day, and even to the\nend of my grandfather’s career the isolation was far greater.  There ran\nno post at all in the Long Island; from the light-house on Barra Head a\nboat must be sent for letters as far as Tobermory, between sixty and\nseventy miles of open sea; and the posts of Shetland, which had surprised\nSir Walter Scott in 1814, were still unimproved in 1833, when my\ngrandfather reported on the subject.  The group contained at the time a\npopulation of 30,000 souls, and enjoyed a trade which had increased in\ntwenty years seven-fold, to between three and four thousand tons.  Yet\nthe mails were despatched and received by chance coasting vessels at the\nrate of a penny a letter; six and eight weeks often elapsed between\nopportunities, and when a mail was to be made up, sometimes at a moment’s\nnotice, the bellman was sent hastily through the streets of Lerwick.\nBetween Shetland and Orkney, only seventy miles apart, there was ‘no\ntrade communication whatever.’\n\nSuch was the state of affairs, only sixty years ago, with the three\nlargest clusters of the Scottish Archipelago; and forty-seven years\nearlier, when Thomas Smith began his rounds, or forty-two, when Robert\nStevenson became conjoined with him in these excursions, the barbarism\nwas deep, the people sunk in superstition, the circumstances of their\nlife perhaps unique in history.  Lerwick and Kirkwall, like Guam or the\nBay of Islands, were but barbarous ports where whalers called to take up\nand to return experienced seamen.  On the outlying islands the clergy\nlived isolated, thinking other thoughts, dwelling in a different country\nfrom their parishioners, like missionaries in the South Seas.  My\ngrandfather’s unrivalled treasury of anecdote was never written down; it\nembellished his talk while he yet was, and died with him when he died;\nand such as have been preserved relate principally to the islands of\nRonaldsay and Sanday, two of the Orkney group.  These bordered on one of\nthe water-highways of civilisation; a great fleet passed annually in\ntheir view, and of the shipwrecks of the world they were the scene and\ncause of a proportion wholly incommensurable to their size.  In one year,\n1798, my grandfather found the remains of no fewer than five vessels on\nthe isle of Sanday, which is scarcely twelve miles long.\n\n    ‘Hardly a year passed,’ he writes, ‘without instances of this kind;\n    for, owing to the projecting points of this strangely formed island,\n    the lowness and whiteness of its eastern shores, and the wonderful\n    manner in which the scanty patches of land are intersected with lakes\n    and pools of water, it becomes, even in daylight, a deception, and\n    has often been fatally mistaken for an open sea.  It had even become\n    proverbial with some of the inhabitants to observe that “if wrecks\n    were to happen, they might as well be sent to the poor isle of Sanday\n    as anywhere else.”  On this and the neighbouring islands the\n    inhabitants had certainly had their share of wrecked goods, for the\n    eye is presented with these melancholy remains in almost every form.\n    For example, although quarries are to be met with generally in these\n    islands, and the stones are very suitable for building dykes\n    (_Anglicé_, walls), yet instances occur of the land being enclosed,\n    even to a considerable extent, with ship-timbers.  The author has\n    actually seen a park (_Anglicé_, meadow) paled round chiefly with\n    cedar-wood and mahogany from the wreck of a Honduras-built ship; and\n    in one island, after the wreck of a ship laden with wine, the\n    inhabitants have been known to take claret to their barley-meal\n    porridge.  On complaining to one of the pilots of the badness of his\n    boat’s sails, he replied to the author with some degree of\n    pleasantry, “Had it been His will that you came na’ here wi’ your\n    lights, we might ‘a’ had better sails to our boats, and more o’ other\n    things.”  It may further be mentioned that when some of Lord Dundas’s\n    farms are to be let in these islands a competition takes place for\n    the lease, and it is _bona fide_ understood that a much higher rent\n    is paid than the lands would otherwise give were it not for the\n    chance of making considerably by the agency and advantages attending\n    shipwrecks on the shores of the respective farms.’\n\nThe people of North Ronaldsay still spoke Norse, or, rather, mixed it\nwith their English.  The walls of their huts were built to a great\nthickness of rounded stones from the sea-beach; the roof flagged, loaded\nwith earth, and perforated by a single hole for the escape of smoke.  The\ngrass grew beautifully green on the flat house-top, where the family\nwould assemble with their dogs and cats, as on a pastoral lawn; there\nwere no windows, and in my grandfather’s expression, ‘there was really no\ndemonstration of a house unless it were the diminutive door.’  He once\nlanded on Ronaldsay with two friends.  The inhabitants crowded and\npressed so much upon the strangers that the bailiff, or resident factor\nof the island, blew with his ox-horn, calling out to the natives to stand\noff and let the gentlemen come forward to the laird; upon which one of\nthe islanders, as spokesman, called out, “God ha’e us, man! thou needsna\nmak’ sic a noise.  It’s no’ every day we ha’e _three hatted men_ on our\nisle.”’  When the Surveyor of Taxes came (for the first time, perhaps) to\nSanday, and began in the King’s name to complain of the unconscionable\nswarms of dogs, and to menace the inhabitants with taxation, it chanced\nthat my grandfather and his friend, Dr. Patrick Neill, were received by\nan old lady in a Ronaldsay hut.  Her hut, which was similar to the model\ndescribed, stood on a Ness, or point of land jutting into the sea.  They\nwere made welcome in the firelit cellar, placed ‘in _casey_ or\nstraw-worked chairs, after the Norwegian fashion, with arms, and a canopy\noverhead,’ and given milk in a wooden dish.  These hospitalities attended\nto, the old lady turned at once to Dr. Neill, whom she took for the\nSurveyor of Taxes.  ‘Sir,’ said she, ‘gin ye’ll tell the King that I\ncanna keep the Ness free o’ the Bangers (sheep) without twa hun’s, and\ntwa guid hun’s too, he’ll pass me threa the tax on dugs.’\n\nThis familiar confidence, these traits of engaging simplicity, are\ncharacters of a secluded people.  Mankind—and, above all, islanders—come\nvery swiftly to a bearing, and find very readily, upon one convention or\nanother, a tolerable corporate life.  The danger is to those from\nwithout, who have not grown up from childhood in the islands, but appear\nsuddenly in that narrow horizon, life-sized apparitions.  For these no\nbond of humanity exists, no feeling of kinship is awakened by their\nperil; they will assist at a shipwreck, like the fisher-folk of Lunga, as\nspectators, and when the fatal scene is over, and the beach strewn with\ndead bodies, they will fence their fields with mahogany, and, after a\ndecent grace, sup claret to their porridge.  It is not wickedness: it is\nscarce evil; it is only, in its highest power, the sense of isolation and\nthe wise disinterestedness of feeble and poor races.  Think how many\nviking ships had sailed by these islands in the past, how many vikings\nhad landed, and raised turmoil, and broken up the barrows of the dead,\nand carried off the wines of the living; and blame them, if you are able,\nfor that belief (which may be called one of the parables of the devil’s\ngospel) that a man rescued from the sea will prove the bane of his\ndeliverer.  It might be thought that my grandfather, coming there\nunknown, and upon an employment so hateful to the inhabitants, must have\nrun the hazard of his life.  But this were to misunderstand.  He came\nfranked by the laird and the clergyman; he was the King’s officer; the\nwork was ‘opened with prayer by the Rev. Walter Trail, minister of the\nparish’; God and the King had decided it, and the people of these pious\nislands bowed their heads.  There landed, indeed, in North Ronaldsay,\nduring the last decade of the eighteenth century, a traveller whose life\nseems really to have been imperilled.  A very little man of a swarthy\ncomplexion, he came ashore, exhausted and unshaved, from a long boat\npassage, and lay down to sleep in the home of the parish schoolmaster.\nBut he had been seen landing.  The inhabitants had identified him for a\nPict, as, by some singular confusion of name, they called the dark and\ndwarfish aboriginal people of the land.  Immediately the obscure ferment\nof a race-hatred, grown into a superstition, began to work in their\nbosoms, and they crowded about the house and the room-door with fearful\nwhisperings.  For some time the schoolmaster held them at bay, and at\nlast despatched a messenger to call my grand-father.  He came: he found\nthe islanders beside themselves at this unwelcome resurrection of the\ndead and the detested; he was shown, as adminicular of testimony, the\ntraveller’s uncouth and thick-soled boots; he argued, and finding\nargument unavailing, consented to enter the room and examine with his own\neyes the sleeping Pict.  One glance was sufficient: the man was now a\nmissionary, but he had been before that an Edinburgh shopkeeper with whom\nmy grandfather had dealt.  He came forth again with this report, and the\nfolk of the island, wholly relieved, dispersed to their own houses.  They\nwere timid as sheep and ignorant as limpets; that was all.  But the Lord\ndeliver us from the tender mercies of a frightened flock!\n\nI will give two more instances of their superstition.  When Sir Walter\nScott visited the Stones of Stennis, my grandfather put in his pocket a\nhundred-foot line, which he unfortunately lost.\n\n    ‘Some years afterwards,’ he writes, ‘one of my assistants on a visit\n    to the Stones of Stennis took shelter from a storm in a cottage close\n    by the lake; and seeing a box-measuring-line in the bole or sole of\n    the cottage window, he asked the woman where she got this well-known\n    professional appendage.  She said: “O sir, ane of the bairns fand it\n    lang syne at the Stanes; and when drawing it out we took fright, and\n    thinking it had belanged to the fairies, we threw it into the bole,\n    and it has layen there ever since.”’\n\nThis is for the one; the last shall be a sketch by the master hand of\nScott himself:\n\n    ‘At the village of Stromness, on the Orkney main island, called\n    Pomona, lived, in 1814, an aged dame called Bessie Millie, who helped\n    out her subsistence by selling favourable winds to mariners.  He was\n    a venturous master of a vessel who left the roadstead of Stromness\n    without paying his offering to propitiate Bessie Millie!  Her fee was\n    extremely moderate, being exactly sixpence, for which she boiled her\n    kettle and gave the bark the advantage of her prayers, for she\n    disclaimed all unlawful acts.  The wind thus petitioned for was sure,\n    she said, to arrive, though occasionally the mariners had to wait\n    some time for it.  The woman’s dwelling and appearance were not\n    unbecoming her pretensions.  Her house, which was on the brow of the\n    steep hill on which Stromness is founded, was only accessible by a\n    series of dirty and precipitous lanes, and for exposure might have\n    been the abode of Eolus himself, in whose commodities the inhabitant\n    dealt.  She herself was, as she told us, nearly one hundred years\n    old, withered and dried up like a mummy.  A clay-coloured kerchief,\n    folded round her neck, corresponded in colour to her corpse-like\n    complexion.  Two light blue eyes that gleamed with a lustre like that\n    of insanity, an utterance of astonishing rapidity, a nose and chin\n    that almost met together, and a ghastly expression of cunning, gave\n    her the effect of Hecate.  Such was Bessie Millie, to whom the\n    mariners paid a sort of tribute with a feeling between jest and\n    earnest.’\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nFrom about the beginning of the century up to 1807 Robert Stevenson was\nin partnership with Thomas Smith.  In the last-named year the partnership\nwas dissolved; Thomas Smith returning to his business, and my grandfather\nbecoming sole engineer to the Board of Northern Lights.\n\nI must try, by excerpts from his diary and correspondence, to convey to\nthe reader some idea of the ardency and thoroughness with which he threw\nhimself into the largest and least of his multifarious engagements in\nthis service.  But first I must say a word or two upon the life of\nlightkeepers, and the temptations to which they are more particularly\nexposed.  The lightkeeper occupies a position apart among men.  In\nsea-towers the complement has always been three since the deplorable\nbusiness in the Eddystone, when one keeper died, and the survivor,\nsignalling in vain for relief, was compelled to live for days with the\ndead body.  These usually pass their time by the pleasant human expedient\nof quarrelling; and sometimes, I am assured, not one of the three is on\nspeaking terms with any other.  On shore stations, which on the Scottish\ncoast are sometimes hardly less isolated, the usual number is two, a\nprincipal and an assistant.  The principal is dissatisfied with the\nassistant, or perhaps the assistant keeps pigeons, and the principal\nwants the water from the roof.  Their wives and families are with them,\nliving cheek by jowl.  The children quarrel; Jockie hits Jimsie in the\neye, and the mothers make haste to mingle in the dissension.  Perhaps\nthere is trouble about a broken dish; perhaps Mrs. Assistant is more\nhighly born than Mrs. Principal and gives herself airs; and the men are\ndrawn in and the servants presently follow.  ‘Church privileges have been\ndenied the keeper’s and the assistant’s servants,’ I read in one case,\nand the eminently Scots periphrasis means neither more nor less than\nexcommunication, ‘on account of the discordant and quarrelsome state of\nthe families.  The cause, when inquired into, proves to be\n_tittle_-_tattle_ on both sides.’  The tender comes round; the foremen\nand artificers go from station to station; the gossip flies through the\nwhole system of the service, and the stories, disfigured and exaggerated,\nreturn to their own birthplace with the returning tender.  The English\nBoard was apparently shocked by the picture of these dissensions.  ‘When\nthe Trinity House can,’ I find my grandfather writing at Beachy Head, in\n1834, ‘they do not appoint two keepers, they disagree so ill.  A man who\nhas a family is assisted by his family; and in this way, to my experience\nand present observation, the business is very much neglected.  One keeper\nis, in my view, a bad system.  This day’s visit to an English lighthouse\nconvinces me of this, as the lightkeeper was walking on a staff with the\ngout, and the business performed by one of his daughters, a girl of\nthirteen or fourteen years of age.’  This man received a hundred a year!\nIt shows a different reading of human nature, perhaps typical of Scotland\nand England, that I find in my grandfather’s diary the following pregnant\nentry: ‘_The lightkeepers_, _agreeing ill_, _keep one another to their\nduty_.’  But the Scottish system was not alone founded on this cynical\nopinion.  The dignity and the comfort of the northern lightkeeper were\nboth attended to.  He had a uniform to ‘raise him in his own estimation,\nand in that of his neighbour, which is of consequence to a person of\ntrust.  The keepers,’ my grandfather goes on, in another place, ‘are\nattended to in all the detail of accommodation in the best style as\nshipmasters; and this is believed to have a sensible effect upon their\nconduct, and to regulate their general habits as members of society.’  He\nnotes, with the same dip of ink, that ‘the brasses were not clean, and\nthe persons of the keepers not _trig’_; and thus we find him writing to a\nculprit: ‘I have to complain that you are not cleanly in your person, and\nthat your manner of speech is ungentle, and rather inclines to rudeness.\nYou must therefore take a different view of your duties as a\nlightkeeper.’  A high ideal for the service appears in these expressions,\nand will be more amply illustrated further on.  But even the Scottish\nlightkeeper was frail.  During the unbroken solitude of the winter\nmonths, when inspection is scarce possible, it must seem a vain toil to\npolish the brass hand-rail of the stair, or to keep an unrewarded vigil\nin the light-room; and the keepers are habitually tempted to the\nbeginnings of sloth, and must unremittingly resist.  He who temporises\nwith his conscience is already lost.  I must tell here an anecdote that\nillustrates the difficulties of inspection.  In the days of my uncle\nDavid and my father there was a station which they regarded with\njealousy.  The two engineers compared notes and were agreed.  The tower\nwas always clean, but seemed always to bear traces of a hasty cleansing,\nas though the keepers had been suddenly forewarned.  On inquiry, it\nproved that such was the case, and that a wandering fiddler was the\nunfailing harbinger of the engineer.  At last my father was storm-stayed\none Sunday in a port at the other side of the island.  The visit was\nquite overdue, and as he walked across upon the Monday morning he\npromised himself that he should at last take the keepers unprepared.\nThey were both waiting for him in uniform at the gate; the fiddler had\nbeen there on Saturday!\n\nMy grandfather, as will appear from the following extracts, was much a\nmartinet, and had a habit of expressing himself on paper with an almost\nstartling emphasis.  Personally, with his powerful voice, sanguine\ncountenance, and eccentric and original locutions, he was well qualified\nto inspire a salutary terror in the service.\n\n    ‘I find that the keepers have, by some means or another, got into the\n    way of cleaning too much with rotten-stone and oil.  I take the\n    principal keeper to _task_ on this subject, and make him bring a\n    clean towel and clean one of the brazen frames, which leaves the\n    towel in an odious state.  This towel I put up in a sheet of paper,\n    seal, and take with me to confront Mr. Murdoch, who has just left the\n    station.’  ‘This letter’—a stern enumeration of complaints—‘to lie a\n    week on the light-room book-place, and to be put in the Inspector’s\n    hands when he comes round.’  ‘It is the most painful thing that can\n    occur for me to have a correspondence of this kind with any of the\n    keepers; and when I come to the Lighthouse, instead of having the\n    satisfaction to meet them with approbation, it is distressing when\n    one is obliged to put on a most angry countenance and demeanour; but\n    from such culpable negligence as you have shown there is no avoiding\n    it.  I hold it as a fixed maxim that, when a man or a family put on a\n    slovenly appearance in their houses, stairs, and lanterns, I always\n    find their reflectors, burners, windows, and light in general, ill\n    attended to; and, therefore, I must insist on cleanliness\n    throughout.’  ‘I find you very deficient in the duty of the high\n    tower.  You thus place your appointment as Principal Keeper in\n    jeopardy; and I think it necessary, as an old servant of the Board,\n    to put you upon your guard once for all at this time.  I call upon\n    you to recollect what was formerly and is now said to you.  The state\n    of the backs of the reflectors at the high tower was disgraceful, as\n    I pointed out to you on the spot.  They were as if spitten upon, and\n    greasy finger-marks upon the back straps.  I demand an explanation of\n    this state of things.’  ‘The cause of the Commissioners dismissing\n    you is expressed in the minute; and it must be a matter of regret to\n    you that you have been so much engaged in smuggling, and also that\n    the Reports relative to the cleanliness of the Lighthouse, upon being\n    referred to, rather added to their unfavourable opinion.’  ‘I do not\n    go into the dwelling-house, but severely chide the lightkeepers for\n    the disagreement that seems to subsist among them.’  ‘The families of\n    the two lightkeepers here agree very ill.  I have effected a\n    reconciliation for the present.’  ‘Things are in a very _humdrum_\n    state here.  There is no painting, and in and out of doors no taste\n    or tidiness displayed.  Robert’s wife _greets_ and M’Gregor’s scolds;\n    and Robert is so down-hearted that he says he is unfit for duty.  I\n    told him that if he was to mind wives’ quarrels, and to take them up,\n    the only way was for him and M’Gregor to go down to the point like\n    Sir G. Grant and Lord Somerset.’  ‘I cannot say that I have\n    experienced a more unpleasant meeting than that of the lighthouse\n    folks this morning, or ever saw a stronger example of unfeeling\n    barbarity than the conduct which the ---s exhibited.  These two\n    cold-hearted persons, not contented with having driven the daughter\n    of the poor nervous woman from her father’s house, _both_ kept\n    _pouncing_ at her, lest she should forget her great misfortune.\n    Write me of their conduct.  Do not make any communication of the\n    state of these families at Kinnaird Head, as this would be like\n    _Tale-bearing_.’\n\nThere is the great word out.  Tales and Tale-bearing, always with the\nemphatic capitals, run continually in his correspondence.  I will give\nbut two instances:—\n\n    ‘Write to David [one of the lightkeepers] and caution him to be more\n    prudent how he expresses himself.  Let him attend his duty to the\n    Lighthouse and his family concerns, and give less heed to\n    Tale-bearers.’  ‘I have not your last letter at hand to quote its\n    date; but, if I recollect, it contains some kind of tales, which\n    nonsense I wish you would lay aside, and notice only the concerns of\n    your family and the important charge committed to you.’\n\nApparently, however, my grandfather was not himself inaccessible to the\nTale-bearer, as the following indicates:\n\n    ‘In walking along with Mr. --- , I explain to him that I should be\n    under the necessity of looking more closely into the business here\n    from his conduct at Buddonness, which had given an instance of\n    weakness in the Moral principle which had staggered my opinion of\n    him.  His answer was, “That will be with regard to the lass?”  I told\n    him I was to enter no farther with him upon the subject.’  ‘Mr.\n    Miller appears to be master and man.  I am sorry about this foolish\n    fellow.  Had I known his train, I should not, as I did, have rather\n    forced him into the service.  Upon finding the windows in the state\n    they were, I turned upon Mr. Watt, and especially upon Mr. Stewart.\n    The latter did not appear for a length of time to have visited the\n    light-room.  On asking the cause—did Mr. Watt and him (_sic_)\n    disagree; he said no; but he had got very bad usage from the\n    assistant, “who was a very obstreperous man.”  I could not bring Mr.\n    Watt to put in language his objections to Miller; all I could get was\n    that, he being your friend, and saying he was unwell, he did not like\n    to complain or to push the man; that the man seemed to have no liking\n    to anything like work; that he was unruly; that, being an educated\n    man, he despised them.  I was, however, determined to have out of\n    these _unwilling_ witnesses the language alluded to.  I fixed upon\n    Mr. Stewart as chief; he hedged.  My curiosity increased, and I\n    urged.  Then he said, “What would I think, just exactly, of Mr. Watt\n    being called an Old B-?”  You may judge of my surprise.  There was\n    not another word uttered.  This was quite enough, as coming from a\n    person I should have calculated upon quite different behaviour from.\n    It spoke a volume of the man’s mind and want of principle.’  ‘Object\n    to the keeper keeping a Bull-Terrier dog of ferocious appearance.  It\n    is dangerous, as we land at all times of the night.’  ‘Have only to\n    complain of the storehouse floor being spotted with oil.  Give orders\n    for this being instantly rectified, so that on my return to-morrow I\n    may see things in good order.’  ‘The furniture of both houses wants\n    much rubbing.  Mrs. ---’s carpets are absurd beyond anything I have\n    seen.  I want her to turn the fenders up with the bottom to the\n    fireplace: the carpets, when not likely to be in use, folded up and\n    laid as a hearthrug partly under the fender.’\n\nMy grandfather was king in the service to his finger-tips.  All should go\nin his way, from the principal lightkeeper’s coat to the assistant’s\nfender, from the gravel in the garden-walks to the bad smell in the\nkitchen, or the oil-spots on the store-room floor.  It might be thought\nthere was nothing more calculated to awake men’s resentment, and yet his\nrule was not more thorough than it was beneficent.  His thought for the\nkeepers was continual, and it did not end with their lives.  He tried to\nmanage their successions; he thought no pains too great to arrange\nbetween a widow and a son who had succeeded his father; he was often\nharassed and perplexed by tales of hardship; and I find him writing,\nalmost in despair, of their improvident habits and the destitution that\nawaited their families upon a death.  ‘The house being completely\nfurnished, they come into possession without necessaries, and they go out\nNAKED.  The insurance seems to have failed, and what next is to be\ntried?’  While they lived he wrote behind their backs to arrange for the\neducation of their children, or to get them other situations if they\nseemed unsuitable for the Northern Lights.  When he was at a lighthouse\non a Sunday he held prayers and heard the children read.  When a keeper\nwas sick, he lent him his horse and sent him mutton and brandy from the\nship.  ‘The assistant’s wife having been this morning confined, there was\nsent ashore a bottle of sherry and a few rusks—a practice which I have\nalways observed in this service,’ he writes.  They dwelt, many of them,\nin uninhabited isles or desert forelands, totally cut off from shops.\nMany of them were, besides, fallen into a rustic dishabitude of life, so\nthat even when they visited a city they could scarce be trusted with\ntheir own affairs, as (for example) he who carried home to his children,\nthinking they were oranges, a bag of lemons.  And my grandfather seems to\nhave acted, at least in his early years, as a kind of gratuitous agent\nfor the service.  Thus I find him writing to a keeper in 1806, when his\nmind was already preoccupied with arrangements for the Bell Rock: ‘I am\nmuch afraid I stand very unfavourably with you as a man of promise, as I\nwas to send several things of which I believe I have more than once got\nthe memorandum.  All I can say is that in this respect you are not\nsingular.  This makes me no better; but really I have been driven about\nbeyond all example in my past experience, and have been essentially\nobliged to neglect my own urgent affairs.’  No servant of the Northern\nLights came to Edinburgh but he was entertained at Baxter’s Place to\nbreakfast.  There, at his own table, my grandfather sat down delightedly\nwith his broad-spoken, homespun officers.  His whole relation to the\nservice was, in fact, patriarchal; and I believe I may say that\nthroughout its ranks he was adored.  I have spoken with many who knew\nhim; I was his grandson, and their words may have very well been words of\nflattery; but there was one thing that could not be affected, and that\nwas the look and light that came into their faces at the name of Robert\nStevenson.\n\nIn the early part of the century the foreman builder was a young man of\nthe name of George Peebles, a native of Anstruther.  My grandfather had\nplaced in him a very high degree of confidence, and he was already\ndesignated to be foreman at the Bell Rock, when, on Christmas-day 1806,\non his way home from Orkney, he was lost in the schooner _Traveller_.\nThe tale of the loss of the _Traveller_ is almost a replica of that of\nthe _Elizabeth_ of Stromness; like the _Elizabeth_ she came as far as\nKinnaird Head, was then surprised by a storm, driven back to Orkney, and\nbilged and sank on the island of Flotta.  It seems it was about the dusk\nof the day when the ship struck, and many of the crew and passengers were\ndrowned.  About the same hour, my grandfather was in his office at the\nwriting-table; and the room beginning to darken, he laid down his pen and\nfell asleep.  In a dream he saw the door open and George Peebles come in,\n‘reeling to and fro, and staggering like a drunken man,’ with water\nstreaming from his head and body to the floor.  There it gathered into a\nwave which, sweeping forward, submerged my grandfather.  Well, no matter\nhow deep; versions vary; and at last he awoke, and behold it was a dream!\nBut it may be conceived how profoundly the impression was written even on\nthe mind of a man averse from such ideas, when the news came of the wreck\non Flotta and the death of George.\n\nGeorge’s vouchers and accounts had perished with himself; and it appeared\nhe was in debt to the Commissioners.  But my grandfather wrote to Orkney\ntwice, collected evidence of his disbursements, and proved him to be\nseventy pounds ahead.  With this sum, he applied to George’s brothers,\nand had it apportioned between their mother and themselves.  He\napproached the Board and got an annuity of £5 bestowed on the widow\nPeebles; and we find him writing her a long letter of explanation and\nadvice, and pressing on her the duty of making a will.  That he should\nthus act executor was no singular instance.  But besides this we are able\nto assist at some of the stages of a rather touching experiment; no less\nthan an attempt to secure Charles Peebles heir to George’s favour.  He is\ndespatched, under the character of ‘a fine young man’; recommended to\ngentlemen for ‘advice, as he’s a stranger in your place, and indeed to\nthis kind of charge, this being his first outset as Foreman’; and for a\nlong while after, the letter-book, in the midst of that thrilling first\nyear of the Bell Rock, is encumbered with pages of instruction and\nencouragement.  The nature of a bill, and the precautions that are to be\nobserved about discounting it, are expounded at length and with\nclearness.  ‘You are not, I hope, neglecting, Charles, to work the\nharbour at spring-tides; and see that you pay the greatest attention to\nget the well so as to supply the keeper with water, for he is a very\nhelpless fellow, and so unfond of hard work that I fear he could do ill\nto keep himself in water by going to the other side for it.’—‘With regard\nto spirits, Charles, I see very little occasion for it.’  These abrupt\napostrophes sound to me like the voice of an awakened conscience; but\nthey would seem to have reverberated in vain in the ears of Charles.\nThere was trouble in Pladda, his scene of operations; his men ran away\nfrom him, there was at least a talk of calling in the Sheriff.  ‘I fear,’\nwrites my grandfather, ‘you have been too indulgent, and I am sorry to\nadd that men do not answer to be too well treated, a circumstance which I\nhave experienced, and which you will learn as you go on in business.’  I\nwonder, was not Charles Peebles himself a case in point?  Either death,\nat least, or disappointment and discharge, must have ended his service in\nthe Northern Lights; and in later correspondence I look in vain for any\nmention of his name—Charles, I mean, not Peebles: for as late as 1839 my\ngrandfather is patiently writing to another of the family: ‘I am sorry\nyou took the trouble of applying to me about your son, as it lies quite\nout of my way to forward his views in the line of his profession as a\nDraper.’\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nA professional life of Robert Stevenson has been already given to the\nworld by his son David, and to that I would refer those interested in\nsuch matters.  But my own design, which is to represent the man, would be\nvery ill carried out if I suffered myself or my reader to forget that he\nwas, first of all and last of all, an engineer.  His chief claim to the\nstyle of a mechanical inventor is on account of the Jib or Balance Crane\nof the Bell Rock, which are beautiful contrivances.  But the great merit\nof this engineer was not in the field of engines.  He was above all\nthings a projector of works in the face of nature, and a modifier of\nnature itself.  A road to be made, a tower to be built, a harbour to be\nconstructed, a river to be trained and guided in its channel—these were\nthe problems with which his mind was continually occupied; and for these\nand similar ends he travelled the world for more than half a century,\nlike an artist, note-book in hand.\n\nHe once stood and looked on at the emptying of a certain oil-tube; he did\nso watch in hand, and accurately timed the operation; and in so doing\noffered the perfect type of his profession.  The fact acquired might\nnever be of use: it was acquired: another link in the world’s huge chain\nof processes was brought down to figures and placed at the service of the\nengineer.  ‘The very term mensuration sounds _engineer-like_,’ I find him\nwriting; and in truth what the engineer most properly deals with is that\nwhich can be measured, weighed, and numbered.  The time of any operation\nin hours and minutes, its cost in pounds, shillings, and pence, the\nstrain upon a given point in foot-pounds—these are his conquests, with\nwhich he must continually furnish his mind, and which, after he has\nacquired them, he must continually apply and exercise.  They must be not\nonly entries in note-books, to be hurriedly consulted; in the actor’s\nphrase, he must be _stale_ in them; in a word of my grandfather’s, they\nmust be ‘fixed in the mind like the ten fingers and ten toes.’\n\nThese are the certainties of the engineer; so far he finds a solid\nfooting and clear views.  But the province of formulas and constants is\nrestricted.  Even the mechanical engineer comes at last to an end of his\nfigures, and must stand up, a practical man, face to face with the\ndiscrepancies of nature and the hiatuses of theory.  After the machine is\nfinished, and the steam turned on, the next is to drive it; and\nexperience and an exquisite sympathy must teach him where a weight should\nbe applied or a nut loosened.  With the civil engineer, more properly so\ncalled (if anything can be proper with this awkward coinage), the\nobligation starts with the beginning.  He is always the practical man.\nThe rains, the winds and the waves, the complexity and the fitfulness of\nnature, are always before him.  He has to deal with the unpredictable,\nwith those forces (in Smeaton’s phrase) that ‘are subject to no\ncalculation’; and still he must predict, still calculate them, at his\nperil.  His work is not yet in being, and he must foresee its influence:\nhow it shall deflect the tide, exaggerate the waves, dam back the\nrain-water, or attract the thunderbolt.  He visits a piece of sea-board;\nand from the inclination and soil of the beach, from the weeds and\nshell-fish, from the configuration of the coast and the depth of\nsoundings outside, he must deduce what magnitude of waves is to be looked\nfor.  He visits a river, its summer water babbling on shallows; and he\nmust not only read, in a thousand indications, the measure of winter\nfreshets, but be able to predict the violence of occasional great floods.\nNay, and more; he must not only consider that which is, but that which\nmay be.  Thus I find my grandfather writing, in a report on the North Esk\nBridge: ‘A less waterway might have sufficed, but the _valleys may come\nto be meliorated by drainage_.’  One field drained after another through\nall that confluence of vales, and we come to a time when they shall\nprecipitate by so much a more copious and transient flood, as the gush of\nthe flowing drain-pipe is superior to the leakage of a peat.\n\nIt is plain there is here but a restricted use for formulas.  In this\nsort of practice, the engineer has need of some transcendental sense.\nSmeaton, the pioneer, bade him obey his ‘feelings’; my father, that\n‘power of estimating obscure forces which supplies a coefficient of its\nown to every rule.’  The rules must be everywhere indeed; but they must\neverywhere be modified by this transcendental coefficient, everywhere\nbent to the impression of the trained eye and the _feelings_ of the\nengineer.  A sentiment of physical laws and of the scale of nature, which\nshall have been strong in the beginning and progressively fortified by\nobservation, must be his guide in the last recourse.  I had the most\nopportunity to observe my father.  He would pass hours on the beach,\nbrooding over the waves, counting them, noting their least deflection,\nnoting when they broke.  On Tweedside, or by Lyne or Manor, we have spent\ntogether whole afternoons; to me, at the time, extremely wearisome; to\nhim, as I am now sorry to think, bitterly mortifying.  The river was to\nme a pretty and various spectacle; I could not see—I could not be made to\nsee—it otherwise.  To my father it was a chequer-board of lively forces,\nwhich he traced from pool to shallow with minute appreciation and\nenduring interest.  ‘That bank was being under-cut,’ he might say.  ‘Why?\nSuppose you were to put a groin out here, would not the _filum fluminis_\nbe cast abruptly off across the channel? and where would it impinge upon\nthe other shore? and what would be the result?  Or suppose you were to\nblast that boulder, what would happen?  Follow it—use the eyes God has\ngiven you—can you not see that a great deal of land would be reclaimed\nupon this side?’  It was to me like school in holidays; but to him, until\nI had worn him out with my invincible triviality, a delight.  Thus he\npored over the engineer’s voluminous handy-book of nature; thus must,\ntoo, have pored my grand-father and uncles.\n\nBut it is of the essence of this knowledge, or this knack of mind, to be\nlargely incommunicable.  ‘It cannot be imparted to another,’ says my\nfather.  The verbal casting-net is thrown in vain over these evanescent,\ninferential relations. Hence the insignificance of much engineering\nliterature.  So far as the science can be reduced to formulas or\ndiagrams, the book is to the point; so far as the art depends on intimate\nstudy of the ways of nature, the author’s words will too often be found\nvapid.  This fact—that engineering looks one way, and literature\nanother—was what my grand-father overlooked.  All his life long, his pen\nwas in his hand, piling up a treasury of knowledge, preparing himself\nagainst all possible contingencies.  Scarce anything fell under his\nnotice but he perceived in it some relation to his work, and chronicled\nit in the pages of his journal in his always lucid, but sometimes inexact\nand wordy, style.  The Travelling Diary (so he called it) was kept in\nfascicles of ruled paper, which were at last bound up, rudely indexed,\nand put by for future reference.  Such volumes as have reached me contain\na surprising medley: the whole details of his employment in the Northern\nLights and his general practice; the whole biography of an enthusiastic\nengineer.  Much of it is useful and curious; much merely otiose; and much\ncan only be described as an attempt to impart that which cannot be\nimparted in words.  Of such are his repeated and heroic descriptions of\nreefs; monuments of misdirected literary energy, which leave upon the\nmind of the reader no effect but that of a multiplicity of words and the\nsuggested vignette of a lusty old gentleman scrambling among tangle.  It\nis to be remembered that he came to engineering while yet it was in the\negg and without a library, and that he saw the bounds of that profession\nwiden daily.  He saw iron ships, steamers, and the locomotive engine,\nintroduced.  He lived to travel from Glasgow to Edinburgh in the inside\nof a forenoon, and to remember that he himself had ‘often been twelve\nhours upon the journey, and his grand-father (Lillie) two days’!  The\nprofession was still but in its second generation, and had already broken\ndown the barriers of time and space.  Who should set a limit to its\nfuture encroachments?  And hence, with a kind of sanguine pedantry, he\npursued his design of ‘keeping up with the day’ and posting himself and\nhis family on every mortal subject.  Of this unpractical idealism we\nshall meet with many instances; there was not a trade, and scarce an\naccomplishment, but he thought it should form part of the outfit of an\nengineer; and not content with keeping an encyclopaedic diary himself, he\nwould fain have set all his sons to work continuing and extending it.\nThey were more happily inspired.  My father’s engineering pocket-book was\nnot a bulky volume; with its store of pregnant notes and vital formulas,\nit served him through life, and was not yet filled when he came to die.\nAs for Robert Stevenson and the Travelling Diary, I should be ungrateful\nto complain, for it has supplied me with many lively traits for this and\nsubsequent chapters; but I must still remember much of the period of my\nstudy there as a sojourn in the Valley of the Shadow.\n\nThe duty of the engineer is twofold—to design the work, and to see the\nwork done.  We have seen already something of the vociferous thoroughness\nof the man, upon the cleaning of lamps and the polishing of reflectors.\nIn building, in road-making, in the construction of bridges, in every\ndetail and byway of his employments, he pursued the same ideal.\nPerfection (with a capital P and violently under-scored) was his design.\nA crack for a penknife, the waste of ‘six-and-thirty shillings,’ ‘the\nloss of a day or a tide,’ in each of these he saw and was revolted by the\nfinger of the sloven; and to spirits intense as his, and immersed in\nvital undertakings, the slovenly is the dishonest, and wasted time is\ninstantly translated into lives endangered.  On this consistent idealism\nthere is but one thing that now and then trenches with a touch of\nincongruity, and that is his love of the picturesque.  As when he laid\nout a road on Hogarth’s line of beauty; bade a foreman be careful, in\nquarrying, not ‘to disfigure the island’; or regretted in a report that\n‘the great stone, called the _Devil in the Hole_, was blasted or broken\ndown to make road-metal, and for other purposes of the work.’\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III: THE BUILDING OF THE BELL ROCK\n\n\nOff the mouths of the Tay and the Forth, thirteen miles from Fifeness,\neleven from Arbroath, and fourteen from the Red Head of Angus, lies the\nInchcape or Bell Rock.  It extends to a length of about fourteen hundred\nfeet, but the part of it discovered at low water to not more than four\nhundred and twenty-seven.  At a little more than half-flood in fine\nweather the seamless ocean joins over the reef, and at high-water springs\nit is buried sixteen feet.  As the tide goes down, the higher reaches of\nthe rock are seen to be clothed by _Conferva rupestris_ as by a sward of\ngrass; upon the more exposed edges, where the currents are most swift and\nthe breach of the sea heaviest, Baderlock or Henware flourishes; and the\ngreat Tangle grows at the depth of several fathoms with luxuriance.\nBefore man arrived, and introduced into the silence of the sea the smoke\nand clangour of a blacksmith’s shop, it was a favourite resting-place of\nseals.  The crab and lobster haunt in the crevices; and limpets, mussels,\nand the white buckie abound.\n\nAccording to a tradition, a bell had been once hung upon this rock by an\nabbot of Arbroath, {91a} ‘and being taken down by a sea-pirate, a year\nthereafter he perished upon the same rock, with ship and goods, in the\nrighteous judgment of God.’  From the days of the abbot and the\nsea-pirate no man had set foot upon the Inchcape, save fishers from the\nneighbouring coast, or perhaps—for a moment, before the surges swallowed\nthem—the unfortunate victims of shipwreck.  The fishers approached the\nrock with an extreme timidity; but their harvest appears to have been\ngreat, and the adventure no more perilous than lucrative.  In 1800, on\nthe occasion of my grandfather’s first landing, and during the two or\nthree hours which the ebb-tide and the smooth water allowed them to pass\nupon its shelves, his crew collected upwards of two hundredweight of old\nmetal: pieces of a kedge anchor and a cabin stove, crowbars, a hinge and\nlock of a door, a ship’s marking-iron, a piece of a ship’s caboose, a\nsoldier’s bayonet, a cannon ball, several pieces of money, a shoe-buckle,\nand the like.  Such were the spoils of the Bell Rock.\n\nFrom 1794 onward, the mind of my grandfather had been exercised with the\nidea of a light upon this formidable danger.  To build a tower on a sea\nrock, eleven miles from shore, and barely uncovered at low water of\nneaps, appeared a fascinating enterprise.  It was something yet\nunattempted, unessayed; and even now, after it has been lighted for more\nthan eighty years, it is still an exploit that has never been repeated.\n{92a}  My grandfather was, besides, but a young man, of an experience\ncomparatively restricted, and a reputation confined to Scotland; and when\nhe prepared his first models, and exhibited them in Merchants’ Hall, he\ncan hardly be acquitted of audacity.  John Clerk of Eldin stood his\nfriend from the beginning, kept the key of the model room, to which he\ncarried ‘eminent strangers,’ and found words of counsel and encouragement\nbeyond price.  ‘Mr. Clerk had been personally known to Smeaton, and used\noccasionally to speak of him to me,’ says my grandfather; and again: ‘I\nfelt regret that I had not the opportunity of a greater range of practice\nto fit me for such an undertaking; but I was fortified by an expression\nof my friend Mr. Clerk in one of our conversations. “This work,” said he,\n“is unique, and can be little forwarded by experience of ordinary masonic\noperations.  In this case Smeaton’s ‘Narrative’ must be the text-book,\nand energy and perseverance the pratique.”’\n\nA Bill for the work was introduced into Parliament and lost in the Lords\nin 1802–3.  John Rennie was afterwards, at my grandfather’s suggestion,\ncalled in council, with the style of chief engineer.  The precise meaning\nattached to these words by any of the parties appears irrecoverable.\nChief engineer should have full authority, full responsibility, and a\nproper share of the emoluments; and there were none of these for Rennie.\nI find in an appendix a paper which resumes the controversy on this\nsubject; and it will be enough to say here that Rennie did not design the\nBell Rock, that he did not execute it, and that he was not paid for it.\n{94a}  From so much of the correspondence as has come down to me, the\nacquaintance of this man, eleven years his senior, and already famous,\nappears to have been both useful and agreeable to Robert Stevenson.  It\nis amusing to find my grandfather seeking high and low for a brace of\npistols which his colleague had lost by the way between Aberdeen and\nEdinburgh; and writing to Messrs. Dollond, ‘I have not thought it\nnecessary to trouble Mr. Rennie with this order, but _I beg you will see\nto get two minutes of him as he passes your door_’—a proposal calculated\nrather from the latitude of Edinburgh than from London, even in 1807.  It\nis pretty, too, to observe with what affectionate regard Smeaton was held\nin mind by his immediate successors.  ‘Poor old fellow,’ writes Rennie to\nStevenson, ‘I hope he will now and then take a peep at us, and inspire\nyou with fortitude and courage to brave all difficulties and dangers to\naccomplish a work which will, if successful, immortalise you in the\nannals of fame.’  The style might be bettered, but the sentiment is\ncharming.\n\nSmeaton was, indeed, the patron saint of the Bell Rock.  Undeterred by\nthe sinister fate of Winstanley, he had tackled and solved the problem of\nthe Eddystone; but his solution had not been in all respects perfect.  It\nremained for my grand-father to outdo him in daring, by applying to a\ntidal rock those principles which had been already justified by the\nsuccess of the Eddystone, and to perfect the model by more than one\nexemplary departure.  Smeaton had adopted in his floors the principle of\nthe arch; each therefore exercised an outward thrust upon the walls,\nwhich must be met and combated by embedded chains.  My grandfather’s\nflooring-stones, on the other hand, were flat, made part of the outer\nwall, and were keyed and dovetailed into a central stone, so as to bind\nthe work together and be positive elements of strength.  In 1703\nWinstanley still thought it possible to erect his strange pagoda, with\nits open gallery, its florid scrolls and candlesticks: like a rich man’s\nfolly for an ornamental water in a park.  Smeaton followed; then\nStevenson in his turn corrected such flaws as were left in Smeaton’s\ndesign; and with his improvements, it is not too much to say the model\nwas made perfect.  Smeaton and Stevenson had between them evolved and\nfinished the sea-tower.  No subsequent builder has departed in anything\nessential from the principles of their design.  It remains, and it seems\nto us as though it must remain for ever, an ideal attained.  Every stone\nin the building, it may interest the reader to know, my grandfather had\nhimself cut out in the model; and the manner in which the courses were\nfitted, joggled, trenailed, wedged, and the bond broken, is intricate as\na puzzle and beautiful by ingenuity.\n\nIn 1806 a second Bill passed both Houses, and the preliminary works were\nat once begun.  The same year the Navy had taken a great harvest of\nprizes in the North Sea, one of which, a Prussian fishing dogger,\nflat-bottomed and rounded at the stem and stern, was purchased to be a\nfloating lightship, and re-named the _Pharos_.  By July 1807 she was\noverhauled, rigged for her new purpose, and turned into the lee of the\nIsle of May.  ‘It was proposed that the whole party should meet in her\nand pass the night; but she rolled from side to side in so extraordinary\na manner, that even the most seahardy fled.  It was humorously observed\nof this vessel that she was in danger of making a round turn and\nappearing with her keel uppermost; and that she would even turn a\nhalf-penny if laid upon deck.’  By two o’clock on the morning of the 15th\nJuly this purgatorial vessel was moored by the Bell Rock.\n\nA sloop of forty tons had been in the meantime built at Leith, and named\nthe _Smeaton_; by the 7th of August my grandfather set sail in her—\n\n    ‘carrying with him Mr. Peter Logan, foreman builder, and five\n    artificers selected from their having been somewhat accustomed to the\n    sea, the writer being aware of the distressing trial which the\n    floating light would necessarily inflict upon landsmen from her\n    rolling motion.  Here he remained till the 10th, and, as the weather\n    was favourable, a landing was effected daily, when the workmen were\n    employed in cutting the large seaweed from the sites of the\n    lighthouse and beacon, which were respectively traced with pickaxes\n    upon the rock.  In the meantime the crew of the _Smeaton_ was\n    employed in laying down the several sets of moorings within about\n    half a mile of the rock for the convenience of vessels.  The\n    artificers, having, fortunately, experienced moderate weather,\n    returned to the workyard of Arbroath with a good report of their\n    treatment afloat; when their comrades ashore began to feel some\n    anxiety to see a place of which they had heard so much, and to change\n    the constant operations with the iron and mallet in the process of\n    hewing for an occasional tide’s work on the rock, which they figured\n    to themselves as a state of comparative ease and comfort.’\n\nI am now for many pages to let my grandfather speak for himself, and tell\nin his own words the story of his capital achievement.  The tall quarto\nof 533 pages from which the following narrative has been dug out is\npractically unknown to the general reader, yet good judges have perceived\nits merit, and it has been named (with flattering wit) ‘The Romance of\nStone and Lime’ and ‘The Robinson Crusoe of Civil Engineering.’  The\ntower was but four years in the building; it took Robert Stevenson, in\nthe midst of his many avocations, no less than fourteen to prepare the\n_Account_.  The title-page is a solid piece of literature of upwards of a\nhundred words; the table of contents runs to thirteen pages; and the\ndedication (to that revered monarch, George IV) must have cost him no\nlittle study and correspondence.  Walter Scott was called in council, and\noffered one miscorrection which still blots the page.  In spite of all\nthis pondering and filing, there remain pages not easy to construe, and\ninconsistencies not easy to explain away.  I have sought to make these\ndisappear, and to lighten a little the baggage with which my grandfather\nmarches; here and there I have rejointed and rearranged a sentence,\nalways with his own words, and all with a reverent and faithful hand; and\nI offer here to the reader the true Monument of Robert Stevenson with a\nlittle of the moss removed from the inscription, and the Portrait of the\nartist with some superfluous canvas cut away.\n\n\n\nI—OPERATIONS OF 1807\n\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 16th Aug.]\n\nEverything being arranged for sailing to the rock on Saturday the 15th,\nthe vessel might have proceeded on the Sunday; but understanding that\nthis would not be so agreeable to the artificers it was deferred until\nMonday.  Here we cannot help observing that the men allotted for the\noperations at the rock seemed to enter upon the undertaking with a degree\nof consideration which fully marked their opinion as to the hazardous\nnature of the undertaking on which they were about to enter.  They went\nin a body to church on Sunday, and whether it was in the ordinary course,\nor designed for the occasion, the writer is not certain, but the service\nwas, in many respects, suitable to their circumstances.\n\n                                                       [Monday, 17th Aug.]\n\nThe tide happening to fall late in the evening of Monday the 17th, the\nparty, counting twenty-four in number, embarked on board of the _Smeaton_\nabout ten o’clock p.m., and sailed from Arbroath with a gentle breeze at\nwest.  Our ship’s colours having been flying all day in compliment to the\ncommencement of the work, the other vessels in the harbour also saluted,\nwhich made a very gay appearance.  A number of the friends and\nacquaintances of those on board having been thus collected, the piers,\nthough at a late hour, were perfectly crowded, and just as the _Smeaton_\ncleared the harbour, all on board united in giving three hearty cheers,\nwhich were returned by those on shore in such good earnest, that, in the\nstill of the evening, the sound must have been heard in all parts of the\ntown, re-echoing from the walls and lofty turrets of the venerable Abbey\nof Aberbrothwick.  The writer felt much satisfaction at the manner of\nthis parting scene, though he must own that the present rejoicing was, on\nhis part, mingled with occasional reflections upon the responsibility of\nhis situation, which extended to the safety of all who should be engaged\nin this perilous work.  With such sensations he retired to his cabin; but\nas the artificers were rather inclined to move about the deck than to\nremain in their confined berths below, his repose was transient, and the\nvessel being small every motion was necessarily heard.  Some who were\nmusically inclined occasionally sung; but he listened with peculiar\npleasure to the sailor at the helm, who hummed over Dibdin’s\ncharacteristic air:—\n\n    ‘They say there’s a Providence sits up aloft,\n    To keep watch for the life of poor Jack.’\n\n                                                      [Tuesday, 18th Aug.]\n\nThe weather had been very gentle all night, and, about four in the\nmorning of the 18th, the _Smeaton_ anchored.  Agreeably to an arranged\nplan of operations, all hands were called at five o’clock a.m., just as\nthe highest part of the Bell Rock began to show its sable head among the\nlight breakers, which occasionally whitened with the foaming sea.  The\ntwo boats belonging to the floating light attended the _Smeaton_, to\ncarry the artificers to the rock, as her boat could only accommodate\nabout six or eight sitters.  Every one was more eager than his neighbour\nto leap into the boats and it required a good deal of management on the\npart of the coxswains to get men unaccustomed to a boat to take their\nplaces for rowing and at the same time trimming her properly.  The\nlanding-master and foreman went into one boat, while the writer took\ncharge of another, and steered it to and from the rock.  This became the\nmore necessary in the early stages of the work, as places could not be\nspared for more than two, or at most three seamen to each boat, who were\nalways stationed, one at the bow, to use the boat-hook in fending or\npushing off, and the other at the aftermost oar, to give the proper time\nin rowing, while the middle oars were double-banked, and rowed by the\nartificers.\n\nAs the weather was extremely fine, with light airs of wind from the east,\nwe landed without difficulty upon the central part of the rock at\nhalf-past five, but the water had not yet sufficiently left it for\ncommencing the work.  This interval, however, did not pass unoccupied.\nThe first and last of all the principal operations at the Bell Rock were\naccompanied by three hearty cheers from all hands, and, on occasions like\nthe present, the steward of the ship attended, when each man was regaled\nwith a glass of rum.  As the water left the rock about six, some began to\nbore the holes for the great bats or holdfasts, for fixing the beams of\nthe Beacon-house, while the smith was fully attended in laying out the\nsite of his forge, upon a somewhat sheltered spot of the rock, which also\nrecommended itself from the vicinity of a pool of water for tempering his\nirons.  These preliminary steps occupied about an hour, and as nothing\nfurther could be done during this tide towards fixing the forge, the\nworkmen gratified their curiosity by roaming about the rock, which they\ninvestigated with great eagerness till the tide overflowed it.  Those who\nhad been sick picked dulse (_Fucus palmatus_), which they ate with much\nseeming appetite; others were more intent upon collecting limpets for\nbait, to enjoy the amusement of fishing when they returned on board of\nthe vessel.  Indeed, none came away empty-handed, as everything found\nupon the Bell Rock was considered valuable, being connected with some\ninteresting association.  Several coins, and numerous bits of shipwrecked\niron, were picked up, of almost every description; and, in particular, a\nmarking-iron lettered JAMES—a circumstance of which it was thought proper\nto give notice to the public, as it might lead to the knowledge of some\nunfortunate shipwreck, perhaps unheard of till this simple occurrence led\nto the discovery.  When the rock began to be overflowed, the\nlanding-master arranged the crews of the respective boats, appointing\ntwelve persons to each.  According to a rule which the writer had laid\ndown to himself, he was always the last person who left the rock.\n\nIn a short time the Bell Rock was laid completely under water, and the\nweather being extremely fine, the sea was so smooth that its place could\nnot be pointed out from the appearance of the surface—a circumstance\nwhich sufficiently demonstrates the dangerous nature of this rock, even\nduring the day, and in the smoothest and calmest state of the sea.\nDuring the interval between the morning and the evening tides, the\nartificers were variously employed in fishing and reading; others were\nbusy in drying and adjusting their wet clothes, and one or two amused\ntheir companions with the violin and German flute.\n\nAbout seven in the evening the signal bell for landing on the rock was\nagain rung, when every man was at his quarters.  In this service it was\nthought more appropriate to use the bell than to _pipe_ to quarters, as\nthe use of this instrument is less known to the mechanic than the sound\nof the bell.  The landing, as in the morning, was at the eastern harbour.\nDuring this tide the seaweed was pretty well cleared from the site of the\noperations, and also from the tracks leading to the different\nlanding-places; for walking upon the rugged surface of the Bell Rock,\nwhen covered with seaweed, was found to be extremely difficult and even\ndangerous.  Every hand that could possibly be occupied now employed in\nassisting the smith to fit up the apparatus for his forge.  At 9 p.m. the\nboats returned to the tender, after other two hours’ work, in the same\norder as formerly—perhaps as much gratified with the success that\nattended the work of this day as with any other in the whole course of\nthe operations.  Although it could not he said that the fatigues of this\nday had been great, yet all on board retired early to rest.  The sea\nbeing calm, and no movement on deck, it was pretty generally remarked in\nthe morning that the bell awakened the greater number on board from their\nfirst sleep; and though this observation was not altogether applicable to\nthe writer himself, yet he was not a little pleased to find that thirty\npeople could all at once become so reconciled to a night’s quarters\nwithin a few hundred paces of the Bell Rock.\n\n                                                    [Wednesday, 19th Aug.]\n\nBeing extremely anxious at this time to get forward with fixing the\nsmith’s forge, on which the progress of the work at present depended, the\nwriter requested that he might be called at daybreak to learn the\nlanding-master’s opinion of the weather from the appearance of the rising\nsun, a criterion by which experienced seamen can generally judge pretty\naccurately of the state of the weather for the following day.  About five\no’clock, on coming upon deck, the sun’s upper limb or disc had just begun\nto appear as if rising from the ocean, and in less than a minute he was\nseen in the fullest splendour; but after a short interval he was\nenveloped in a soft cloudy sky, which was considered emblematical of fine\nweather.  His rays had not yet sufficiently dispelled the clouds which\nhid the land from view, and the Bell Rock being still overflowed, the\nwhole was one expanse of water.  This scene in itself was highly\ngratifying; and, when the morning bell was tolled, we were gratified with\nthe happy forebodings of good weather and the expectation of having both\na morning and an evening tide’s work on the rock.\n\nThe boat which the writer steered happened to be the last which\napproached the rock at this tide; and, in standing up in the stern, while\nat some distance, to see how the leading boat entered the creek, he was\nastonished to observe something in the form of a human figure, in a\nreclining posture, upon one of the ledges of the rock.  He immediately\nsteered the boat through a narrow entrance to the eastern harbour, with a\nthousand unpleasant sensations in his mind.  He thought a vessel or boat\nmust have been wrecked upon the rock during the night; and it seemed\nprobable that the rock might be strewed with dead bodies, a spectacle\nwhich could not fail to deter the artificers from returning so freely to\ntheir work.  In the midst of these reveries the boat took the ground at\nan improper landing-place; but, without waiting to push her off, he leapt\nupon the rock, and making his way hastily to the spot which had privately\ngiven him alarm, he had the satisfaction to ascertain that he had only\nbeen deceived by the peculiar situation and aspect of the smith’s anvil\nand block, which very completely represented the appearance of a lifeless\nbody upon the rock.  The writer carefully suppressed his feelings, the\nsimple mention of which might have had a bad effect upon the artificers,\nand his haste passed for an anxiety to examine the apparatus of the\nsmith’s forge, left in an unfinished state at evening tide.\n\nIn the course of this morning’s work two or three apparently distant\npeals of thunder were heard, and the atmosphere suddenly became thick and\nfoggy.  But as the _Smeaton_, our present tender, was moored at no great\ndistance from the rock, the crew on board continued blowing with a horn,\nand occasionally fired a musket, so that the boats got to the ship\nwithout difficulty.\n\n                                                     [Thursday, 20th Aug.]\n\nThe wind this morning inclined from the north-east, and the sky had a\nheavy and cloudy appearance, but the sea was smooth, though there was an\nundulating motion on, the surface, which indicated easterly winds, and\noccasioned a slight surf upon the rock.  But the boats found no\ndifficulty in landing at the western creek at half-past seven, and, after\na good tide’s work, left it again about a quarter from eleven.  In the\nevening the artificers landed at half-past seven, and continued till\nhalf-past eight, having completed the fixing of the smith’s forge, his\nvice, and a wooden board or bench, which were also batted to a ledge of\nthe rock, to the great joy of all, under a salute of three hearty cheers.\nFrom an oversight on the part of the smith, who had neglected to bring\nhis tinder-box and matches from the vessel, the work was prevented from\nbeing continued for at least an hour longer.\n\nThe smith’s shop was, of course, in _open space_: the large bellows were\ncarried to and from the rock every tide, for the serviceable condition of\nwhich, together with the tinder-box, fuel, and embers of the former fire,\nthe smith was held responsible.  Those who have been placed in situations\nto feel the inconveniency and want of this useful artisan, will be able\nto appreciate his value in a case like the present.  It often happened,\nto our annoyance and disappointment, in the early state of the work, when\nthe smith was in the middle of a _favourite heat_ in making some useful\narticle, or in sharpening the tools, after the flood-tide had obliged the\npickmen to strike work, a sea would come rolling over the rocks, dash out\nthe fire, and endanger his indispensable implement, the bellows.  If the\nsea was smooth, while the smith often stood at work knee-deep in water,\nthe tide rose by imperceptible degrees, first cooling the exterior of the\nfireplace, or hearth, and then quietly blackening and extinguishing the\nfire from below.  The writer has frequently been amused at the perplexing\nanxiety of the blacksmith when coaxing his fire and endeavouring to avert\nthe effects of the rising tide.\n\n                                                       [Friday, 21st Aug.]\n\nEverything connected with the forge being now completed, the artificers\nfound no want of sharp tools, and the work went forward with great\nalacrity and spirit.  It was also alleged that the rock had a more\nhabitable appearance from the volumes of smoke which ascended from the\nsmith’s shop and the busy noise of his anvil, the operations of the\nmasons, the movements of the boats, and shipping at a distance—all\ncontributed to give life and activity to the scene.  This noise and\ntraffic had, however, the effect of almost completely banishing the herd\nof seals which had hitherto frequented the rock as a resting-place during\nthe period of low water.  The rock seemed to be peculiarly adapted to\ntheir habits, for, excepting two or three days at neap-tides, a part of\nit always dries at low water—at least, during the summer season—and as\nthere was good fishing-ground in the neighbourhood, without a human being\nto disturb or molest them, it had become a very favourite residence of\nthese amphibious animals, the writer having occasionally counted from\nfifty to sixty playing about the rock at a time.  But when they came to\nbe disturbed every tide, and their seclusion was broken in upon by the\nkindling of great fires, together with the beating of hammers and picks\nduring low water, after hovering about for a time, they changed their\nplace, and seldom more than one or two were to be seen about the rock\nupon the more detached outlayers which dry partially, whence they seemed\nto look with that sort of curiosity which is observable in these animals\nwhen following a boat.\n\n                                                     [Saturday, 22nd Aug.]\n\nHitherto the artificers had remained on board the _Smeaton_, which was\nmade fast to one of the mooring buoys at a distance only of about a\nquarter of a mile from the rock, and, of course, a very great conveniency\nto the work.  Being so near, the seamen could never be mistaken as to the\nprogress of the tide, or state of the sea upon the rock, nor could the\nboats be much at a loss to pull on board of the vessel during fog, or\neven in very rough weather; as she could be cast loose from her moorings\nat pleasure, and brought to the lee side of the rock.  But the _Smeaton_\nbeing only about forty register tons, her accommodations were extremely\nlimited.  It may, therefore, be easily imagined that an addition of\ntwenty-four persons to her own crew must have rendered the situation of\nthose on board rather uncomfortable.  The only place for the men’s\nhammocks on board being in the hold, they were unavoidably much crowded:\nand if the weather had required the hatches to be fastened down, so great\na number of men could not possibly have been accommodated.  To add to\nthis evil, the _co-boose_ or cooking-place being upon deck, it would not\nhave been possible to have cooked for so large a company in the event of\nbad weather.\n\nThe stock of water was now getting short, and some necessaries being also\nwanted for the floating light, the _Smeaton_ was despatched for Arbroath;\nand the writer, with the artificers at the same time shifted their\nquarters from her to the floating light.\n\nAlthough the rock barely made its appearance at this period of the tides\ntill eight o’clock, yet, having now a full mile to row from the floating\nlight to the rock, instead of about a quarter of a mile from the moorings\nof the _Smeaton_, it was necessary to be earlier astir, and to form\ndifferent arrangements; breakfast was accordingly served up at seven\no’clock this morning.  From the excessive motion of the floating light,\nthe writer had looked forward rather with anxiety to the removal of the\nworkmen to this ship.  Some among them, who had been congratulating\nthemselves upon having become sea-hardy while on board the _Smeaton_, had\na complete relapse upon returning to the floating light.  This was the\ncase with the writer.  From the spacious and convenient berthage of the\nfloating light, the exchange to the artificers was, in this respect, much\nfor the better.  The boats were also commodious, measuring sixteen feet\nin length on the keel, so that, in fine weather, their complement of\nsitters was sixteen persons for each, with which, however, they were\nrather crowded, but she could not stow two boats of larger dimensions.\nWhen there was what is called a breeze of wind, and a swell in the sea,\nthe proper number for each boat could not, with propriety, be rated at\nmore than twelve persons.\n\nWhen the tide-bell rung the boats were hoisted out, and two active seamen\nwere employed to keep them from receiving damage alongside.  The floating\nlight being very buoyant, was so quick in her motions that when those who\nwere about to step from her gunwale into a boat, placed themselves upon a\ncleat or step on the ship’s side, with the man or rail ropes in their\nhands, they had often to wait for some time till a favourable opportunity\noccurred for stepping into the boat.  While in this situation, with the\nvessel rolling from side to side, watching the proper time for letting go\nthe man-ropes, it required the greatest dexterity and presence of mind to\nleap into the boats.  One who was rather awkward would often wait a\nconsiderable period in this position: at one time his side of the ship\nwould be so depressed that he would touch the boat to which he belonged,\nwhile the next sea would elevate him so much that he would see his\ncomrades in the boat on the opposite side of the ship, his friends in the\none boat calling to him to ‘Jump,’ while those in the boat on the other\nside, as he came again and again into their view, would jocosely say,\n‘Are you there yet?  You seem to enjoy a swing.’  In this situation it\nwas common to see a person upon each side of the ship for a length of\ntime, waiting to quit his hold.\n\nOn leaving the rock to-day a trial of seamanship was proposed amongst the\nrowers, for by this time the artificers had become tolerably expert in\nthis exercise.  By inadvertency some of the oars provided had been made\nof fir instead of ash, and although a considerable stock had been laid\nin, the workmen, being at first awkward in the art, were constantly\nbreaking their oars; indeed it was no uncommon thing to see the broken\nblades of a pair of oars floating astern, in the course of a passage from\nthe rock to the vessel.  The men, upon the whole, had but little work to\nperform in the course of a day; for though they exerted themselves\nextremely hard while on the rock, yet, in the early state of the\noperations, this could not be continued for more than three or four hours\nat a time, and as their rations were large—consisting of one pound and a\nhalf of beef, one pound of ship biscuit, eight ounces oatmeal, two ounces\nbarley, two ounces butter, three quarts of small beer, with vegetables\nand salt—they got into excellent spirits when free of sea-sickness.  The\nrowing of the boats against each other became a favourite amusement,\nwhich was rather a fortunate circumstance, as it must have been attended\nwith much inconvenience had it been found necessary to employ a\nsufficient number of sailors for this purpose.  The writer, therefore,\nencouraged the spirit of emulation, and the speed of their respective\nboats became a favourite topic.  Premiums for boat-races were instituted,\nwhich were contended for with great eagerness, and the respective crews\nkept their stations in the boats with as much precision as they kept\ntheir beds on board of the ship.  With these and other pastimes, when the\nweather was favourable, the time passed away among the inmates of the\nforecastle and waist of the ship.  The writer looks back with interest\nupon the hours of solitude which he spent in this lonely ship with his\nsmall library.\n\nThis being the first Saturday that the artificers were afloat, all hands\nwere served with a glass of rum and water at night, to drink the sailors’\nfavourite toast of ‘Wives and Sweethearts.’  It was customary, upon these\noccasions, for the seamen and artificers to collect in the galley, when\nthe musical instruments were put in requisition: for, according to\ninvariable practice, every man must play a tune, sing a song, or tell a\nstory.\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 23rd Aug.]\n\nHaving, on the previous evening, arranged matters with the landing-master\nas to the business of the day, the signal was rung for all hands at\nhalf-past seven this morning.  In the early state of the spring-tides the\nartificers went to the rock before breakfast, but as the tides fell later\nin the day, it became necessary to take this meal before leaving the\nship.  At eight o’clock all hands were assembled on the quarter-deck for\nprayers, a solemnity which was gone through in as orderly a manner as\ncircumstances would admit.  When the weather permitted, the flags of the\nship were hung up as an awning or screen, forming the quarter-deck into a\ndistinct compartment; the pendant was also hoisted at the mainmast, and a\nlarge ensign flag was displayed over the stern; and lastly, the ship’s\ncompanion, or top of the staircase, was covered with the _flag proper_ of\nthe Lighthouse Service, on which the Bible was laid.  A particular toll\nof the bell called all hands to the quarter-deck, when the writer read a\nchapter of the Bible, and, the whole ship’s company being uncovered, he\nalso read the impressive prayer composed by the Reverend Dr. Brunton, one\nof the ministers of Edinburgh.\n\nUpon concluding this service, which was attended with becoming reverence\nand attention, all on board retired to their respective berths to\nbreakfast, and, at half-past nine, the bell again rung for the artificers\nto take their stations in their respective boats.  Some demur having been\nevinced on board about the propriety of working on Sunday, which had\nhitherto been touched upon as delicately as possible, all hands being\ncalled aft, the writer, from the quarter-deck, stated generally the\nnature of the service, expressing his hopes that every man would feel\nhimself called upon to consider the erection of a lighthouse on the Bell\nRock, in every point of view, as a work of necessity and mercy.  He knew\nthat scruples had existed with some, and these had, indeed, been fairly\nand candidly urged before leaving the shore; but it was expected that,\nafter having seen the critical nature of the rock, and the necessity of\nthe measure, every man would now be satisfied of the propriety of\nembracing all opportunities of landing on the rock when the state of the\nweather would permit.  The writer further took them to witness that it\ndid not proceed from want of respect for the appointments and established\nforms of religion that he had himself adopted the resolution of attending\nthe Bell Rock works on the Sunday; but, as he hoped, from a conviction\nthat it was his bounden duty, on the strictest principles of morality.\nAt the same time it was intimated that, if any were of a different\nopinion, they should be perfectly at liberty to hold their sentiments\nwithout the imputation of contumacy or disobedience; the only difference\nwould be in regard to the pay.\n\nUpon stating this much, he stepped into his boat, requesting all who were\nso disposed to follow him.  The sailors, from their habits, found no\nscruple on this subject, and all of the artificers, though a little\ntardy, also embarked, excepting four of the masons, who, from the\nbeginning, mentioned that they would decline working on Sundays.  It may\nhere be noticed that throughout the whole of the operations it was\nobservable that the men wrought, if possible, with more keenness upon the\nSundays than at other times from an impression that they were engaged in\na work of imperious necessity, which required every possible exertion.\nOn returning to the floating light, after finishing the tide’s work, the\nboats were received by the part of the ship’s crew left on board with the\nusual attention of handing ropes to the boats and helping the artificers\non board; but the four masons who had absented themselves from the work\ndid not appear upon deck.\n\n                                                       [Monday, 24th Aug.]\n\nThe boats left the floating light at a quarter-past nine o’clock this\nmorning, and the work began at three-quarters past nine; but as the\nneap-tides were approaching the working time at the rock became gradually\nshorter, and it was now with difficulty that two and a half hours’ work\ncould be got.  But so keenly had the workmen entered into the spirit of\nthe beacon-house operations, that they continued to bore the holes in the\nrock till some of them were knee-deep in water.\n\nThe operations at this time were entirely directed to the erection of the\nbeacon, in which every man felt an equal interest, as at this critical\nperiod the slightest casualty to any of the boats at the rock might have\nbeen fatal to himself individually, while it was perhaps peculiar to the\nwriter more immediately to feel for the safety of the whole.  Each log or\nupright beam of the beacon was to be fixed to the rock by two strong and\nmassive bats or stanchions of iron.  These bats, for the fixture of the\nprincipal and diagonal beams and bracing chains, required fifty-four\nholes, each measuring two inches in diameter and eighteen inches in\ndepth.  There had already been so considerable a progress made in boring\nand excavating the holes that the writer’s hopes of getting the beacon\nerected this year began to be more and more confirmed, although it was\nnow advancing towards what was considered the latter end of the proper\nworking season at the Bell Rock.  The foreman joiner, Mr. Francis Watt,\nwas accordingly appointed to attend at the rock to-day, when the\nnecessary levels were taken for the step or seat of each particular beam\nof the beacon, that they might be cut to their respective lengths, to\nsuit the inequalities of the rock; several of the stanchions were also\ntried into their places, and other necessary observations made, to\nprevent mistakes on the application of the apparatus, and to facilitate\nthe operations when the beams came to be set up, which would require to\nbe done in the course of a single tide.\n\n                                                      [Tuesday, 25th Aug.]\n\nWe had now experienced an almost unvaried tract of light airs of easterly\nwind, with clear weather in the fore-part of the day and fog in the\nevenings.  To-day, however, it sensibly changed; when the wind came to\nthe south-west, and blew a fresh breeze.  At nine a.m. the bell rung, and\nthe boats were hoisted out, and though the artificers were now pretty\nwell accustomed to tripping up and down the sides of the floating light,\nyet it required more seamanship this morning than usual.  It therefore\nafforded some merriment to those who had got fairly seated in their\nrespective boats to see the difficulties which attended their companions,\nand the hesitating manner in which they quitted hold of the man-ropes in\nleaving the ship.  The passage to the rock was tedious, and the boats did\nnot reach it till half-past ten.\n\nIt being now the period of neap-tides, the water only partially left the\nrock, and some of the men who were boring on the lower ledges of the site\nof the beacon stood knee-deep in water.  The situation of the smith\nto-day was particularly disagreeable, but his services were at all times\nindispensable.  As the tide did not leave the site of the forge, he stood\nin the water, and as there was some roughness on the surface it was with\nconsiderable difficulty that, with the assistance of the sailors, he was\nenabled to preserve alive his fire; and, while his feet were immersed in\nwater, his face was not only scorched but continually exposed to volumes\nof smoke, accompanied with sparks from the fire, which were occasionally\nset up owing to the strength and direction of the wind.\n\n                                                    [Wednesday, 26th Aug.]\n\nThe wind had shifted this morning to N.N.W., with rain, and was blowing\nwhat sailors call a fresh breeze.  To speak, perhaps, somewhat more\nintelligibly to the general reader, the wind was such that a fishing-boat\ncould just carry full sail.  But as it was of importance, specially in\nthe outset of the business, to keep up the spirit of enterprise for\nlanding on all practicable occasions, the writer, after consulting with\nthe landing-master, ordered the bell to be rung for embarking, and at\nhalf-past eleven the boats reached the rock, and left it again at a\nquarter-past twelve, without, however, being able to do much work, as the\nsmith could not be set to work from the smallness of the ebb and the\nstrong breach of sea, which lashed with great force among the bars of the\nforge.\n\nJust as we were about to leave the rock the wind shifted to the S.W.,\nand, from a fresh gale, it became what seamen term a hard gale, or such\nas would have required the fisherman to take in two or three reefs in his\nsail.  It is a curious fact that the respective tides of ebb and flood\nare apparent upon the shore about an hour and a half sooner than at the\ndistance of three or four miles in the offing.  But what seems chiefly\ninteresting here is that the tides around this small sunken rock should\nfollow exactly the same laws as on the extensive shores of the mainland.\nWhen the boats left the Bell Rock to-day it was overflowed by the\nflood-tide, but the floating light did not swing round to the flood-tide\nfor more than an hour afterwards.  Under this disadvantage the boats had\nto struggle with the ebb-tide and a hard gale of wind, so that it was\nwith the greatest difficulty that they reached the floating light.  Had\nthis gale happened in spring-tides when the current was strong we must\nhave been driven to sea in a very helpless condition.\n\nThe boat which the writer steered was considerably behind the other, one\nof the masons having unluckily broken his oar.  Our prospect of getting\non board, of course, became doubtful, and our situation was rather\nperilous, as the boat shipped so much sea that it occupied two of the\nartificers to bale and clear her of water.  When the oar gave way we were\nabout half a mile from the ship, but, being fortunately to windward, we\ngot into the wake of the floating light, at about 250 fathoms astern,\njust as the landing-master’s boat reached the vessel.  He immediately\nstreamed or floated a life-buoy astern, with a line which was always in\nreadiness, and by means of this useful implement the boat was towed\nalongside of the floating light, where, from her rolling motion, it\nrequired no small management to get safely on board, as the men were much\nworn out with their exertions in pulling from the rock.  On the present\noccasion the crews of both boats were completely drenched with spray, and\nthose who sat upon the bottom of the boats to bale them were sometimes\npretty deep in the water before it could be cleared out.  After getting\non board, all hands were allowed an extra dram, and, having shifted and\ngot a warm and comfortable dinner, the affair, it is believed, was little\nmore thought of.\n\n                                                     [Thursday, 27th Aug.]\n\nThe tides were now in that state which sailors term the dead of the neap,\nand it was not expected that any part of the rock would be seen above\nwater to-day; at any rate, it was obvious, from the experience of\nyesterday, that no work could be done upon it, and therefore the\nartificers were not required to land.  The wind was at west, with light\nbreezes, and fine clear weather; and as it was an object with the writer\nto know the actual state of the Bell Rock at neap-tides, he got one of\nthe boats manned, and, being accompanied by the landing-master, went to\nit at a quarter-past twelve.  The parts of the rock that appeared above\nwater being very trifling, were covered by every wave, so that no landing\nwas made.  Upon trying the depth of water with a boathook, particularly\non the sites of the lighthouse and beacon, on the former, at low water,\nthe depth was found to be three feet, and on the central parts of the\nlatter it was ascertained to be two feet eight inches.  Having made these\nremarks, the boat returned to the ship at two p.m., and the weather being\ngood, the artificers were found amusing themselves with fishing.  The\n_Smeaton_ came from Arbroath this afternoon, and made fast to her\nmoorings, having brought letters and newspapers, with parcels of clean\nlinen, etc., for the workmen, who were also made happy by the arrival of\nthree of their comrades from the workyard ashore.  From these men they\nnot only received all the news of the workyard, but seemed themselves to\nenjoy great pleasure in communicating whatever they considered to be\ninteresting with regard to the rock.  Some also got letters from their\nfriends at a distance, the postage of which for the men afloat was always\nfree, so that they corresponded the more readily.\n\nThe site of the building having already been carefully traced out with\nthe pick-axe, the artificers this day commenced the excavation of the\nrock for the foundation or first course of the lighthouse.  Four men only\nwere employed at this work, while twelve continued at the site of the\nbeacon-house, at which every possible opportunity was embraced, till this\nessential art of the operations should be completed.\n\n                                                    [Wednesday, 2nd Sept.]\n\nThe floating light’s bell rung this morning at half-past four o’clock, as\na signal for the boats to be got ready, and the landing took place at\nhalf-past five.  In passing the _Smeaton_ at her moorings near the rock,\nher boat followed with eight additional artificers who had come from\nArbroath with her at last trip, but there being no room for them in the\nfloating light’s boats, they had continued on board.  The weather did not\nlook very promising in the morning, the wind blowing pretty fresh from\nW.S.W.: and had it not been that the writer calculated upon having a\nvessel so much at command, in all probability he would not have ventured\nto land.  The _Smeaton_ rode at what sailors call a _salvagee_, with a\ncross-head made fast to the floating buoy.  This kind of attachment was\nfound to be more convenient than the mode of passing the hawser through\nthe ring of the buoy when the vessel was to be made fast.  She had then\nonly to be steered very close to the buoy, when the salvagee was laid\nhold of with a boat-hook, and the _bite_ of the hawser thrown over the\ncross-head.  But the salvagee, by this method, was always left at the\nbuoy, and was, of course, more liable to chafe and wear than a hawser\npassed through the ring, which could be wattled with canvas, and shifted\nat pleasure.  The salvagee and cross method is, however, much practised;\nbut the experience of this morning showed it to be very unsuitable for\nvessels riding in an exposed situation for any length of time.\n\nSoon after the artificers landed they commenced work; but the wind coming\nto blow hard, the _Smeaton’s_ boat and crew, who had brought their\ncomplement of eight men to the rock, went off to examine her riding\nropes, and see that they were in proper order.  The boat had no sooner\nreached the vessel than she went adrift, carrying the boat along with\nher.  By the time that she was got round to make a tack towards the rock,\nshe had drifted at least three miles to leeward, with the praam-boat\nastern; and, having both the wind and a tide against her, the writer\nperceived, with no little anxiety, that she could not possibly return to\nthe rock till long after its being overflowed; for, owing to the anomaly\nof the tides formerly noticed, the Bell Rock is completely under water\nwhen the ebb abates to the offing.\n\nIn this perilous predicament, indeed, he found himself placed between\nhope and despair—but certainly the latter was by much the most\npredominant feeling of his mind—situate upon a sunken rock in the middle\nof the ocean, which, in the progress of the flood-tide, was to be laid\nunder water to the depth of at least twelve feet in a stormy sea.  There\nwere this morning thirty-two persons in all upon the rock, with only two\nboats, whose complement, even in good weather, did not exceed twenty-four\nsitters; but to row to the floating light with so much wind, and in so\nheavy a sea, a complement of eight men for each boat was as much as\ncould, with propriety, be attempted, so that, in this way, about one-half\nof our number was unprovided for.  Under these circumstances, had the\nwriter ventured to despatch one of the boats in expectation of either\nworking the _Smeaton_ sooner up towards the rock, or in hopes of getting\nher boat brought to our assistance, this must have given an immediate\nalarm to the artificers, each of whom would have insisted upon taking to\nhis own boat, and leaving the eight artificers belonging to the _Smeaton_\nto their chance.  Of course a scuffle might have ensued, and it is hard\nto say, in the ardour of men contending for life, where it might have\nended.  It has even been hinted to the writer that a party of the\n_pickmen_ were determined to keep exclusively to their own boat against\nall hazards.\n\nThe unfortunate circumstance of the _Smeaton_ and her boat having drifted\nwas, for a considerable time, only known to the writer and to the\nlanding-master, who removed to the farther point of the rock, where he\nkept his eye steadily upon the progress of the vessel.  While the\nartificers were at work, chiefly in sitting or kneeling postures,\nexcavating the rock, or boring with the jumpers, and while their numerous\nhammers, with the sound of the smith’s anvil, continued, the situation of\nthings did not appear so awful.  In this state of suspense, with almost\ncertain destruction at hand, the water began to rise upon those who were\nat work on the lower parts of the sites of the beacon and lighthouse.\nFrom the run of sea upon the rock, the forge fire was also sooner\nextinguished this morning than usual, and the volumes of smoke having\nceased, objects in every direction became visible from all parts of the\nrock.  After having had about three ‘hours’ work, the men began, pretty\ngenerally, to make towards their respective boats for their jackets and\nstockings, when, to their astonishment, instead of three, they found only\ntwo boats, the third being adrift with the _Smeaton_.  Not a word was\nuttered by any one, but all appeared to be silently calculating their\nnumbers, and looking to each other with evident marks of perplexity\ndepicted in their countenances.  The landing-master, conceiving that\nblame might be attached to him for allowing the boat to leave the rock,\nstill kept at a distance.  At this critical moment the author was\nstanding upon an elevated part of Smith’s Ledge, where he endeavoured to\nmark the progress of the _Smeaton_, not a little surprised that her crew\ndid not cut the praam adrift, which greatly retarded her way, and amazed\nthat some effort was not making to bring at least the boat, and attempt\nour relief.  The workmen looked steadfastly upon the writer, and turned\noccasionally towards the vessel, still far to leeward. {122a}  All this\npassed in the most perfect silence, and the melancholy solemnity of the\ngroup made an impression never to be effaced from his mind.\n\nThe writer had all along been considering of various schemes—providing\nthe men could be kept under command—which might be put in practice for\nthe general safety, in hopes that the _Smeaton_ might be able to pick up\nthe boats to leeward, when they were obliged to leave the rock.  He was,\naccordingly, about to address the artificers on the perilous nature of\ntheir circumstances, and to propose that all hands should unstrip their\nupper clothing when the higher parts of the rock were laid under water;\nthat the seamen should remove every unnecessary weight and encumbrance\nfrom the boats; that a specified number of men should go into each boat,\nand that the remainder should hang by the gunwales, while the boats were\nto be rowed gently towards the _Smeaton_, as the course to the _Pharos_,\nor floating light, lay rather to windward of the rock.  But when he\nattempted to speak his mouth was so parched that his tongue refused\nutterance, and he now learned by experience that the saliva is as\nnecessary as the tongue itself for speech.  He turned to one of the pools\non the rock and lapped a little water, which produced immediate relief.\nBut what was his happiness, when on rising from this unpleasant beverage,\nsome one called out, ‘A boat! a boat!’ and, on looking around, at no\ngreat distance, a large boat was seen through the haze making towards the\nrock.  This at once enlivened and rejoiced every heart.  The timeous\nvisitor proved to be James Spink, the Bell Rock pilot, who had come\nexpress from Arbroath with letters.  Spink had for some time seen the\n_Smeaton_, and had even supposed, from the state of the weather, that all\nhands were on board of her till he approached more nearly and observed\npeople upon the rock; but not supposing that the assistance of his boat\nwas necessary to carry the artificers off the rock, he anchored on the\nlee-side and began to fish, waiting, as usual, till the letters were sent\nfor, as the pilot-boat was too large and unwieldy for approaching the\nrock when there was any roughness or run of the sea at the entrance of\nthe landing creeks.\n\nUpon this fortunate change of circumstances, sixteen of the artificers\nwere sent, at two trips, in one of the boats, with instructions for Spink\nto proceed with them to the floating light.  This being accomplished, the\nremaining sixteen followed in the two boats belonging to the service of\nthe rock.  Every one felt the most perfect happiness at leaving the Bell\nRock this morning, though a very hard and even dangerous passage to the\nfloating light still awaited us, as the wind by this time had increased\nto a pretty hard gale, accompanied with a considerable swell of sea.\nEvery one was as completely drenched in water as if he had been dragged\nastern of the boats.  The writer, in particular, being at the helm,\nfound, on getting on board, that his face and ears were completely coated\nwith a thin film of salt from the sea spray, which broke constantly over\nthe bows of the boat.  After much baling of water and severe work at the\noars, the three boats reached the floating light, where some new\ndifficulties occurred in getting on board in safety, owing partly to the\nexhausted state of the men, and partly to the violent rolling of the\nvessel.\n\nAs the tide flowed, it was expected that the _Smeaton_ would have got to\nwindward; but, seeing that all was safe, after tacking for several hours\nand making little progress, she bore away for Arbroath, with the\npraam-boat.  As there was now too much wind for the pilot-boat to return\nto Arbroath, she was made fast astern of the floating light, and the crew\nremained on board till next day, when the weather moderated.  There can\nbe very little doubt that the appearance of James Spink with his boat on\nthis critical occasion was the means of preventing the loss of lives at\nthe rock this morning.  When these circumstances, some years afterwards,\ncame to the knowledge of the Board, a small pension was ordered to our\nfaithful pilot, then in his seventieth year; and he still continues to\nwear the uniform clothes and badge of the Lighthouse service.  Spink is a\nremarkably strong man, whose _tout ensemble_ is highly characteristic of\na North-country fisherman.  He usually dresses in a _pé-jacket_, cut\nafter a particular fashion, and wears a large, flat, blue bonnet.  A\nstriking likeness of Spink in his pilot-dress, with the badge or insignia\non his left arm which is characteristic of the boatmen in the service of\nthe Northern Lights, has been taken by Howe, and is in the writer’s\npossession.\n\n                                                     [Thursday, 3rd Sept.]\n\nThe bell rung this morning at five o’clock, but the writer must\nacknowledge, from the circumstances of yesterday, that its sound was\nextremely unwelcome.  This appears also to have been the feelings of the\nartificers, for when they came to be mustered, out of twenty-six, only\neight, besides the foreman and seamen, appeared upon deck to accompany\nthe writer to the rock.  Such are the baneful effects of anything like\nmisfortune or accident connected with a work of this description.  The\nuse of argument to persuade the men to embark in cases of this kind would\nhave been out of place, as it is not only discomfort, or even the risk of\nthe loss of a limb, but life itself that becomes the question.  The\nboats, notwithstanding the thinness of our ranks, left the vessel at\nhalf-past five.  The rough weather of yesterday having proved but a\nsummer’s gale, the wind came to-day in gentle breezes; yet, the\natmosphere being cloudy, it a not a very favourable appearance.  The\nboats reached the rock at six a.m., and the eight artificers who landed\nwere employed in clearing out the bat-holes for the beacon-house, and had\na very prosperous tide of four hours’ work, being the longest yet\nexperienced by half an hour.\n\nThe boats left the rock again at ten o’clock, and the weather having\ncleared up as we drew near the vessel, the eighteen artificers who had\nremained on board were observed upon deck, but as the boats approached\nthey sought their way below, being quite ashamed of their conduct.  This\nwas the only instance of refusal to go to the rock which occurred during\nthe whole progress of the work, excepting that of the four men who\ndeclined working upon Sunday, a case which the writer did not conceive to\nbe at all analogous to the present.  It may here be mentioned, much to\nthe credit of these four men, that they stood foremost in embarking for\nthe rock this morning.\n\n                                                     [Saturday, 5th Sept.]\n\nIt was fortunate that a landing was not attempted this evening, for at\neight o’clock the wind shifted to E.S.E., and at ten it had become a hard\ngale, when fifty fathoms of the floating light’s hempen cable were veered\nout.  The gale still increasing, the ship rolled and laboured\nexcessively, and at midnight eighty fathoms of cable were veered out;\nwhile the sea continued to strike the vessel with a degree of force which\nhad not before been experienced.\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 6th Sept.]\n\nDuring the last night there was little rest on board of the _Pharos_, and\ndaylight, though anxiously wished for, brought no relief, as the gale\ncontinued with unabated violence.  The sea struck so hard upon the\nvessel’s bows that it rose in great quantities, or in ‘green seas,’ as\nthe sailors termed it, which were carried by the wind as far aft as the\nquarter-deck, and not infrequently over the stern of the ship altogether.\nIt fell occasionally so heavily on the skylight of the writer’s cabin,\nthough so far aft as to be within five feet of the helm, that the glass\nwas broken to pieces before the dead-light could be got into its place,\nso that the water poured down in great quantities.  In shutting out the\nwater, the admission of light was prevented, and in the morning all\ncontinued in the most comfortless state of darkness.  About ten o’clock\na.m. the wind shifted to N.E., and blew, if possible, harder than before,\nand it was accompanied by a much heavier swell of sea.  In the course of\nthe gale, the part of the cable in the hause-hole had been so often\nshifted that nearly the whole length of one of her hempen cables, of 120\nfathoms, had been veered out, besides the chain-moorings.  The cable, for\nits preservation, was also carefully served or wattled with pieces of\ncanvas round the windlass, and with leather well greased in the\nhause-hole.  In this state things remained during the whole day, every\nsea which struck the vessel—and the seas followed each other in close\nsuccession—causing her to shake, and all on board occasionally to\ntremble.  At each of these strokes of the sea the rolling and pitching of\nthe vessel ceased for a time, and her motion was felt as if she had\neither broke adrift before the wind or were in the act of sinking; but,\nwhen another sea came, she ranged up against it with great force, and\nthis became the regular intimation of our being still riding at anchor.\n\nAbout eleven o’clock, the writer with some difficulty got out of bed,\nbut, in attempting to dress, he was thrown twice upon the floor at the\nopposite end of the cabin.  In an undressed state he made shift to get\nabout half-way up the companion-stairs, with an intention to observe the\nstate of the sea and of the ship upon deck; but he no sooner looked over\nthe companion than a heavy sea struck the vessel, which fell on the\nquarter-deck, and rushed downstairs in the officers’ cabin in so\nconsiderable a quantity that it was found necessary to lift one of the\nscuttles in the floor, to let the water into the limbers of the ship, as\nit dashed from side to side in such a manner as to run into the lower\ntier of beds.  Having been foiled in this attempt, and being completely\nwetted, he again got below and went to bed.  In this state of the weather\nthe seamen had to move about the necessary or indispensable duties of the\nship with the most cautious use both of hands and feet, while it required\nall the art of the landsman to keep within the precincts of his bed.  The\nwriter even found himself so much tossed about that it became necessary,\nin some measure, to shut himself in bed, in order to avoid being thrown\nupon the floor.  Indeed, such was the motion of the ship that it seemed\nwholly impracticable to remain in any other than a lying posture.  On\ndeck the most stormy aspect presented itself, while below all was wet and\ncomfortless.\n\n About two o’clock p.m. a great alarm was given throughout the ship from\nthe effects of a very heavy sea which struck her, and almost filled the\nwaist, pouring down into the berths below, through every chink and\ncrevice of the hatches and skylights.  From the motion of the vessel\nbeing thus suddenly deadened or checked, and from the flowing in of the\nwater above, it is believed there was not an individual on board who did\nnot think, at the moment, that the vessel had foundered, and was in the\nact of sinking.  The writer could withstand this no longer, and as soon\nas she again began to range to the sea he determined to make another\neffort to get upon deck.  In the first instance, however, he groped his\nway in darkness from his own cabin through the berths of the officers,\nwhere all was quietness.  He next entered the galley and other\ncompartments occupied by the artificers.  Here also all was shut up in\ndarkness, the fire having been drowned out in the early part of the gale.\nSeveral of the artificers were employed in prayer, repeating psalms and\nother devotional exercises in a full tone of voice; others protesting\nthat, if they should fortunately get once more on shore, no one should\never see them afloat again.  With the assistance of the landing-master,\nthe writer made his way, holding on step by step, among the numerous\nimpediments which lay in the way.  Such was the creaking noise of the\nbulk-heads or partitions, the dashing of the water, and the whistling\nnoise of the winds, that it was hardly possible to break in upon such a\nconfusion of sounds.  In one or two instances, anxious and repeated\ninquiries were made by the artificers as to the state of things upon\ndeck, to which the captain made the usual answer, that it could not blow\nlong in this way, and that we must soon have better weather.  The next\nberth in succession, moving forward in the ship, was that allotted for\nthe seamen.  Here the scene was considerably different.  Having reached\nthe middle of this darksome berth without its inmates being aware of any\nintrusion, the writer had the consolation of remarking that, although\nthey talked of bad weather and the cross accidents of the sea, yet the\nconversation was carried on in that sort of tone and manner which bespoke\nan ease and composure of mind highly creditable to them and pleasing to\nhim.  The writer immediately accosted the seamen about the state of the\nship.  To these inquiries they replied that the vessel being light, and\nhaving but little hold of the water, no top-rigging, with excellent\nground-tackle, and everything being fresh and new, they felt perfect\nconfidence in their situation.\n\nIt being impossible to open any of the hatches in the fore part of the\nship in communicating with the deck, the watch was changed by passing\nthrough the several berths to the companion-stair leading to the\nquarter-deck.  The writer, therefore, made the best of his way aft, and,\non a second attempt to look out, he succeeded, and saw indeed an\nastonishing sight.  The sea or waves appeared to be ten or fifteen feet\nin height of unbroken water, and every approaching billow seemed as if it\nwould overwhelm our vessel, but she continued to rise upon the waves and\nto fall between the seas in a very wonderful manner.  It seemed to be\nonly those seas which caught her in the act of rising which struck her\nwith so much violence and threw such quantities of water aft.  On deck\nthere was only one solitary individual looking out, to give the alarm in\nthe event of the ship breaking from her moorings.  The seaman on watch\ncontinued only two hours; he who kept watch at this time was a tall,\nslender man of a black complexion; he had no greatcoat nor over-all of\nany kind, but was simply dressed in his ordinary jacket and trousers; his\nhat was tied under his chin with a napkin, and he stood aft the foremast,\nto which he had lashed himself with a gasket or small rope round his\nwaist, to prevent his falling upon deck or being washed overboard.  When\nthe writer looked up, he appeared to smile, which afforded a further\nsymptom of the confidence of the crew in their ship.  This person on\nwatch was as completely wetted as if he had been drawn through the sea,\nwhich was given as a reason for his not putting on a greatcoat, that he\nmight wet as few of his clothes as possible, and have a dry shift when he\nwent below.  Upon deck everything that was movable was out of sight,\nhaving either been stowed below, previous to the gale, or been washed\noverboard.  Some trifling parts of the quarter boards were damaged by the\nbreach of the sea; and one of the boats upon deck was about one-third\nfull of water, the oyle-hole or drain having been accidently stopped up,\nand part of her gunwale had received considerable injury.  These\nobservations were hastily made, and not without occasionally shutting the\ncompanion, to avoid being wetted by the successive seas which broke over\nthe bows and fell upon different parts of the deck according to the\nimpetus with which the waves struck the vessel.  By this time it was\nabout three o’clock in the afternoon, and the gale, which had now\ncontinued with unabated force for twenty-seven hours, had not the least\nappearance of going off.\n\nIn the dismal prospect of undergoing another night like the last, and\nbeing in imminent hazard of parting from our cable, the writer thought it\nnecessary to advise with the master and officers of the ship as to the\nprobable event of the vessel’s drifting from her moorings.  They\nseverally gave it as their opinion that we had now every chance of riding\nout the gale, which, in all probability, could not continue with the same\nfury many hours longer; and that even if she should part from her anchor,\nthe storm-sails had been laid to hand, and could be bent in a very short\ntime.  They further stated that from the direction of the wind being\nN.E., she would sail up the Firth of Forth to Leith Roads.  But if this\nshould appear doubtful, after passing the Island and Light of May, it\nmight be advisable at once to steer for Tyningham Sands, on the western\nside of Dunbar, and there run the vessel ashore.  If this should happen\nat the time of high-water, or during the ebbing of the tide, they were of\nopinion, from the flatness and strength of the floating light, that no\ndanger would attend her taking the ground, even with a very heavy sea.\nThe writer, seeing the confidence which these gentlemen possessed with\nregard to the situation of things, found himself as much relieved with\nthis conversation as he had previously been with the seeming indifference\nof the forecastle men, and the smile of the watch upon deck, though\nliterally lashed to the foremast.  From this time he felt himself almost\nperfectly at ease; at any rate, he was entirely resigned to the ultimate\nresult.\n\nAbout six o’clock in the evening the ship’s company was heard moving upon\ndeck, which on the present occasion was rather the cause of alarm.  The\nwriter accordingly rang his bell to know what was the matter, when he was\ninformed by the steward that the weather looked considerably better, and\nthat the men upon deck were endeavouring to ship the smoke-funnel of the\ngalley that the people might get some meat.  This was a more favourable\naccount than had been anticipated.  During the last twenty-one hours he\nhimself had not only had nothing to eat, but he had almost never passed a\nthought on the subject.  Upon the mention of a change of weather, he sent\nthe steward to learn how the artificers felt, and on his return he stated\nthat they now seemed to be all very happy, since the cook had begun to\nlight the galley-fire and make preparations for the suet-pudding of\nSunday, which was the only dish to be attempted for the mess, from the\nease with which it could both be cooked and served up.\n\nThe principal change felt upon the ship as the wind abated was her\nincreased rolling motion, but the pitching was much diminished, and now\nhardly any sea came farther aft than the foremast: but she rolled so\nextremely hard as frequently to dip and take in water over the gunwales\nand rails in the waist.  By nine o’clock all hands had been refreshed by\nthe exertions of the cook and steward, and were happy in the prospect of\nthe worst of the gale being over.  The usual complement of men was also\nnow set on watch, and more quietness was experienced throughout the ship.\nAlthough the previous night had been a very restless one, it had not the\neffect of inducing repose in the writer’s berth on the succeeding night;\nfor having been so much tossed about in bed during the last thirty hours,\nhe found no easy spot to turn to, and his body was all sore to the touch,\nwhich ill accorded with the unyielding materials with which his bed-place\nwas surrounded.\n\n                                                       [Monday, 7th Sept.]\n\nThis morning, about eight o’clock, the writer was agreeably surprised to\nsee the scuttle of his cabin sky-light removed, and the bright rays of\nthe sun admitted.  Although the ship continued to roll excessively, and\nthe sea was still running very high, yet the ordinary business on board\nseemed to be going forward on deck.  It was impossible to steady a\ntelescope, so as to look minutely at the progress of the waves and trace\ntheir breach upon the Bell Rock; but the height to which the\ncross-running waves rose in sprays when they met each other was truly\ngrand, and the continued roar and noise of the sea was very perceptible\nto the ear.  To estimate the height of the sprays at forty or fifty feet\nwould surely be within the mark.  Those of the workmen who were not much\nafflicted with sea-sickness, came upon deck, and the wetness below being\ndried up, the cabins were again brought into a habitable state.  Every\none seemed to meet as if after a long absence, congratulating his\nneighbour upon the return of good weather.  Little could be said as to\nthe comfort of the vessel, but after riding out such a gale, no one felt\nthe least doubt or hesitation as to the safety and good condition of her\nmoorings.  The master and mate were extremely anxious, however, to heave\nin the hempen cable, and see the state of the clinch or iron ring of the\nchain-cable.  But the vessel rolled at such a rate that the seamen could\nnot possibly keep their feet at the windlass nor work the hand-spikes,\nthough it had been several times attempted since the gale took off.\n\nAbout twelve noon, however, the vessel’s motion was observed to be\nconsiderably less, and the sailors were enabled to walk upon deck with\nsome degree of freedom.  But, to the astonishment of every one, it was\nsoon discovered that the floating light was adrift!  The windlass was\ninstantly manned, and the men soon gave out that there was no strain upon\nthe cable.  The mizzen sail, which was bent for the occasional purpose of\nmaking the vessel ride more easily to the tide, was immediately set, and\nthe other sails were also hoisted in a short time, when, in no small\nconsternation, we bore away about one mile to the south-westward of the\nformer station, and there let go the best bower anchor and cable in\ntwenty fathoms water, to ride until the swell of the sea should fall,\nwhen it might be practicable to grapple for the moorings, and find a\nbetter anchorage for the ship.\n\n                                                     [Tuesday, 15th Sept.]\n\nThis morning, at five a.m., the bell rung as a signal for landing upon\nthe rock, a sound which, after a lapse of ten days, it is believed was\nwelcomed by every one on board.  There being a heavy breach of sea at the\neastern creek, we landed, though not without difficulty, on the western\nside, every one seeming more eager than another to get upon the rock; and\nnever did hungry men sit down to a hearty meal with more appetite than\nthe artificers began to pick the dulse from the rocks.  This marine plant\nhad the effect of reviving the sickly, and seemed to be no less relished\nby those who were more hardy.\n\nWhile the water was ebbing, and the men were roaming in quest of their\nfavourite morsel, the writer was examining the effects of the storm upon\nthe forge and loose apparatus left upon the rock.  Six large blocks of\ngranite which had been landed, by way of experiment, on the 1st instant,\nwere now removed from their places and, by the force of the sea, thrown\nover a rising ledge into a hole at the distance of twelve or fifteen\npaces from the place on which they had been landed.  This was a pretty\ngood evidence both of the violence of the storm and the agitation of the\nsea upon the rock.  The safety of the smith’s forge was always an object\nof essential regard.  The ash-pan of the hearth or fireplace, with its\nweighty cast-iron back, had been washed from their places of supposed\nsecurity; the chains of attachment had been broken, and these ponderous\narticles were found at a very considerable distance in a hole on the\nwestern side of the rock; while the tools and picks of the Aberdeen\nmasons were scattered about in every direction.  It is, however,\nremarkable that not a single article was ultimately lost.\n\nThis being the night on which the floating light was advertised to be\nlighted, it was accordingly exhibited, to the great joy of every one.\n\n                                                   [Wednesday, 16th Sept.]\n\nThe writer was made happy to-day by the return of the Lighthouse yacht\nfrom a voyage to the Northern Lighthouses.  Having immediately removed on\nboard of this fine vessel of eighty-one tons register, the artificers\ngladly followed; for, though they found themselves more pinched for\naccommodation on board of the yacht, and still more so in the _Smeaton_,\nyet they greatly preferred either of these to the _Pharos_, or floating\nlight, on account of her rolling motion, though in all respects fitted up\nfor their conveniency.\n\nThe writer called them to the quarter-deck and informed them that, having\nbeen one mouth afloat, in terms of their agreement they were now at\nliberty to return to the workyard at Arbroath if they preferred this to\ncontinuing at the Bell Rock.  But they replied that, in the prospect of\nsoon getting the beacon erected upon the rock, and having made a change\nfrom the floating light, they were now perfectly reconciled to their\nsituation, and would remain afloat till the end of the working season.\n\n                                                    [Thursday, 17th Sept.]\n\nThe wind was at N.E. this morning, and though they were only light airs,\nyet there was a pretty heavy swell coming ashore upon the rock.  The\nboats landed at half-past seven o’clock a.m., at the creek on the\nsouthern side of the rock, marked Port Hamilton.  But as one of the boats\nwas in the act of entering this creek, the seaman at the bow-oar, who had\njust entered the service, having inadvertently expressed some fear from a\nheavy sea which came rolling towards the boat, and one of the artificers\nhaving at the same time looked round and missed a stroke with his oar,\nsuch a preponderance was thus given to the rowers upon the opposite side\nthat when the wave struck the boat it threw her upon a ledge of shelving\nrocks, where the water left her, and she having _kanted_ to seaward, the\nnext wave completely filled her with water.  After making considerable\nefforts the boat was again got afloat in the proper track of the creek,\nso that we landed without any other accident than a complete ducking.\nThere being no possibility of getting a shift of clothes, the artificers\nbegan with all speed to work, so as to bring themselves into heat, while\nthe writer and his assistants kept as much as possible in motion.  Having\nremained more than an hour upon the rock, the boats left it at half-past\nnine; and, after getting on board, the writer recommended to the\nartificers, as the best mode of getting into a state of comfort, to strip\noff their wet clothes and go to bed for an hour or two.  No further\ninconveniency was felt, and no one seemed to complain of the affection\ncalled ‘catching cold.’\n\n                                                      [Friday, 18th Sept.]\n\nAn important occurrence connected with the operations of this season was\nthe arrival of the _Smeaton_ at four p.m., having in tow the six\nprincipal beams of the beacon-house, together with all the stanchions and\nother work on board for fixing it on the rock.  The mooring of the\nfloating light was a great point gained, but in the erection of the\nbeacon at this late period of the season new difficulties presented\nthemselves.  The success of such an undertaking at any season was\nprecarious, because a single day of bad weather occurring before the\nnecessary fixtures could be made might sweep the whole apparatus from the\nrock.  Notwithstanding these difficulties, the writer had determined to\nmake the trial, although he could almost have wished, upon looking at the\nstate of the clouds and the direction of the wind, that the apparatus for\nthe beacon had been still in the workyard.\n\n                                                    [Saturday, 19th Sept.]\n\nThe main beams of the beacon were made up in two separate rafts, fixed\nwith bars and bolts of iron.  One of these rafts, not being immediately\nwanted, was left astern of the floating light, and the other was kept in\ntow by the _Smeaton_, at the buoy nearest to the rock.  The Lighthouse\nyacht rode at another buoy with all hands on board that could possibly be\nspared out of the floating light.  The party of artificers and seamen\nwhich landed on the rock counted altogether forty in number.  At\nhalf-past eight o’clock a derrick, or mast of thirty feet in height, was\nerected and properly supported with guy-ropes, for suspending the block\nfor raising the first principal beam of the beacon; and a winch machine\nwas also bolted down to the rock for working the purchase-tackle.\n\nUpon raising the derrick, all hands on the rock spontaneously gave three\nhearty cheers, as a favourable omen of our future exertions in pointing\nout more permanently the position of the rock.  Even to this single spar\nof timber, could it be preserved, a drowning man might lay hold.  When\nthe _Smeaton_ drifted on the 2nd of this month such a spar would have\nbeen sufficient to save us till she could have come to our relief.\n\n                                                      [Sunday, 20th Sept.]\n\nThe wind this morning was variable, but the weather continued extremely\nfavourable for the operations throughout the whole day.  At six a.m. the\nboats were in motion, and the raft, consisting of four of the six\nprincipal beams of the beacon-house, each measuring about sixteen inches\nsquare, and fifty feet in length, was towed to the rock, where it was\nanchored, that it might ground upon it as the water ebbed.  The sailors\nand artificers, including all hands, to-day counted no fewer than\nfifty-two, being perhaps the greatest number of persons ever collected\nupon the Bell Rock.  It was early in the tide when the boats reached the\nrock, and the men worked a considerable time up to their middle in water,\nevery one being more eager than his neighbour to be useful.  Even the\nfour artificers who had hitherto declined working on Sunday were to-day\nmost zealous in their exertions.  They had indeed become so convinced of\nthe precarious nature and necessity of the work that they never\nafterwards absented themselves from the rock on Sunday when a landing was\npracticable.\n\nHaving made fast a piece of very good new line, at about two-thirds from\nthe lower end of one of the beams, the purchase-tackle of the derrick was\nhooked into the turns of the line, and it was speedily raised by the\nnumber of men on the rock and the power of the winch tackle.  When this\nlog was lifted to a sufficient height, its foot, or lower end, was\n_stepped_ into the spot which had been previously prepared for it.  Two\nof the great iron stanchions were then set in their respective holes on\neach side of the beam, when a rope was passed round them and the beam, to\nprevent it from slipping till it could be more permanently fixed.  The\nderrick, or upright spar used for carrying the tackle to raise the first\nbeam, was placed in such a position as to become useful for supporting\nthe upper end of it, which now became, in its turn, the prop of the\ntackle for raising the second beam.  The whole difficulty of this\noperation was in the raising and propping of the first beam, which became\na convenient derrick for raising the second, these again a pair of shears\nfor lifting the third, and the shears a triangle for raising the fourth.\nHaving thus got four of the six principal beams set on end, it required a\nconsiderable degree of trouble to get their upper ends to fit.  Here they\nformed the apex of a cone, and were all together mortised into a large\npiece of beechwood, and secured, for the present, with ropes, in a\ntemporary manner.  During the short period of one tide all that could\nfurther be done for their security was to put a single screw-bolt through\nthe great kneed bats or stanchions on each side of the beams, and screw\nthe nut home.\n\nIn this manner these four principal beams were erected, and left in a\npretty secure state.  The men had commenced while there was about two or\nthree feet of water upon the side of the beacon, and as the sea was\nsmooth they continued the work equally long during flood-tide.  Two of\nthe boats being left at the rock to take off the joiners, who were busily\nemployed on the upper parts till two o’clock p.m., this tide’s work may\nbe said to have continued for about seven hours, which was the longest\nthat had hitherto been got upon the rock by at least three hours.\n\nWhen the first boats left the rock with the artificers employed on the\nlower part of the work during the flood-tide, the beacon had quite a\nnovel appearance.  The beams erected formed a common base of about\nthirty-three feet, meeting at the top, which was about forty-five feet\nabove the rock, and here half a dozen of the artificers were still at\nwork.  After clearing the rock the boats made a stop, when three hearty\ncheers were given, which were returned with equal goodwill by those upon\nthe beacon, from the personal interest which every one felt in the\nprosperity of this work, so intimately connected with his safety.\n\nAll hands having returned to their respective ships, they got a shift of\ndry clothes and some refreshment.  Being Sunday, they were afterwards\nconvened by signal on board of the Lighthouse yacht, when prayers were\nread; for every heart upon this occasion felt gladness, and every mind\nwas disposed to be thankful for the happy and successful termination of\nthe operations of this day.\n\n                                                      [Monday, 21st Sept.]\n\nThe remaining two principal beams were erected in the course of this\ntide, which, with the assistance of those set up yesterday, was found to\nbe a very simple operation.\n\nThe six principal beams of the beacon were thus secured, at least in a\ntemporary manner, in the course of two tides, or in the short space of\nabout eleven hours and a half.  Such is the progress that may be made\nwhen active hands and willing minds set properly to work in operations of\nthis kind.\n\n                                                     [Tuesday 22nd, Sept.]\n\nHaving now got the weighty part of this work over, and being thereby\nrelieved of the difficulty both of landing and victualling such a number\nof men, the _Smeaton_ could now be spared, and she was accordingly\ndespatched to Arbroath for a supply of water and provisions, and carried\nwith her six of the artificers who could best be spared.\n\n                                                   [Wednesday, 23rd Sept.]\n\nIn going out of the eastern harbour, the boat which the writer steered\nshipped a sea, that filled her about one-third with water.  She had also\nbeen hid for a short time, by the waves breaking upon the rock, from the\nsight of the crew of the preceding boat, who were much alarmed for our\nsafety, imagining for a time that she had gone down.\n\nThe _Smeaton_ returned from Arbroath this afternoon, but there was so\nmuch sea that she could not be made fast to her moorings, and the vessel\nwas obliged to return to Arbroath without being able either to deliver\nthe provisions or take the artificers on board.  The Lighthouse yacht was\nalso soon obliged to follow her example, as the sea was breaking heavily\nover her bows.  After getting two reefs in the mainsail, and the third or\nstorm-jib set, the wind being S.W., she bent to windward, though blowing\na hard gale, and got into St. Andrews Bay, where we passed the night\nunder the lee of Fifeness.\n\n                                                    [Thursday, 24th Sept.]\n\nAt two o’clock this morning we were in St. Andrews Bay, standing off and\non shore, with strong gales of wind at S.W.; at seven we were off the\nentrance of the Tay; at eight stood towards the rock, and at ten passed\nto leeward of it, but could not attempt a landing.  The beacon, however,\nappeared to remain in good order, and by six p.m. the vessel had again\nbeaten up to St. Andrews Bay, and got into somewhat smoother water for\nthe night.\n\n                                                      [Friday, 25th Sept.]\n\nAt seven o’clock bore away for the Bell Rock, but finding a heavy sea\nrunning on it were unable to land.  The writer, however, had the\nsatisfaction to observe, with his telescope, that everything about the\nbeacon appeared entire: and although the sea had a most frightful\nappearance, yet it was the opinion of every one that, since the erection\nof the beacon, the Bell Rock was divested of many of its terrors, and had\nit been possible to have got the boats hoisted out and manned, it might\nhave even been found practicable to land.  At six it blew so hard that it\nwas found necessary to strike the topmast and take in a third reef of the\nmainsail, and under this low canvas we soon reached St. Andrews Bay, and\ngot again under the lee of the land for the night.  The artificers, being\nsea-hardy, were quite reconciled to their quarters on board of the\nLighthouse yacht; but it is believed that hardly any consideration would\nhave induced them again to take up their abode in the floating light.\n\n                                                    [Saturday, 26th Sept.]\n\nAt daylight the yacht steered towards the Bell Rock, and at eight a.m.\nmade fast to her moorings; at ten, all hands, to the amount of thirty,\nlanded, when the writer had the happiness to find that the beacon had\nwithstood the violence of the gale and the heavy breach of sea,\neverything being found in the same state in which it had been left on the\n21st.  The artificers were now enabled to work upon the rock throughout\nthe whole day, both at low and high water, but it required the strictest\nattention to the state of the weather, in case of their being overtaken\nwith a gale, which might prevent the possibility of getting them off the\nrock.\n\nTwo somewhat memorable circumstances in the annals of the Bell Rock\nattended the operations of this day: one was the removal of Mr. James\nDove, the foreman smith, with his apparatus, from the rock to the upper\npart of the beacon, where the forge was now erected on a temporary\nplatform, laid on the cross beams or upper framing.  The other was the\nartificers having dined for the first time upon the rock, their dinner\nbeing cooked on board of the yacht, and sent to them by one of the boats.\nBut what afforded the greatest happiness and relief was the removal of\nthe large bellows, which had all along been a source of much trouble and\nperplexity, by their hampering and incommoding the boat which carried the\nsmiths and their apparatus.\n\n                                                      [Saturday, 3rd Oct.]\n\nThe wind being west to-day, the weather was very favourable for\noperations at the rock, and during the morning and evening tides, with\nthe aid of torchlight, the masons had seven hours’ work upon the site of\nthe building.  The smiths and joiners, who landed at half-past six a.m.,\ndid not leave the rock till a quarter-past eleven p.m., having been at\nwork, with little intermission, for sixteen hours and three-quarters.\nWhen the water left the rock, they were employed at the lower parts of\nthe beacon, and as the tide rose or fell, they shifted the place of their\noperations.  From these exertions, the fixing and securing of the beacon\nmade rapid advancement, as the men were now landed in the morning and\nremained throughout the day.  But, as a sudden change of weather might\nhave prevented their being taken off at the proper time of tide, a\nquantity of bread and water was always kept on the beacon.\n\nDuring this period of working at the beacon all the day, and often a\ngreat part of the night, the writer was much on board of the tender; but,\nwhile the masons could work on the rock, and frequently also while it was\ncovered by the tide, he remained on the beacon; especially during the\nnight, as he made a point of being on the rock to the latest hour, and\nwas generally the last person who stepped into the boat.  He had laid\nthis down as part of his plan of procedure; and in this way had acquired,\nin the course of the first season, a pretty complete knowledge and\nexperience of what could actually be done at the Bell Rock, under all\ncircumstances of the weather.  By this means also his assistants, and the\nartificers and mariners, got into a systematic habit of proceeding at the\ncommencement of the work, which, it is believed, continued throughout the\nwhole of the operations.\n\n                                                        [Sunday, 4th Oct.]\n\nThe external part of the beacon was now finished, with its supports and\nbracing-chains, and whatever else was considered necessary for its\nstability in so far as the season would permit; and although much was\nstill wanting to complete this fabric, yet it was in such a state that it\ncould be left without much fear of the consequences of a storm.  The\npainting of the upper part was nearly finished this afternoon; and the\n_Smeaton_ had brought off a quantity of brushwood and other articles, for\nthe purpose of heating or charring the lower part of the principal beams,\nbefore being laid over with successive coats of boiling pitch, to the\nheight of from eight to twelve feet, or as high as the rise of\nspring-tides.  A small flagstaff having also been erected to-day, a flag\nwas displayed for the first time from the beacon, by which its\nperspective effect was greatly improved.  On this, as on all like\noccasions at the Bell Rock, three hearty cheers were given; and the\nsteward served out a dram of rum to all hands, while the Lighthouse\nyacht, _Smeaton_, and floating light, hoisted their colours in compliment\nto the erection.\n\n                                                        [Monday, 5th Oct.]\n\nIn the afternoon, and just as the tide’s work was over, Mr. John Rennie,\nengineer, accompanied by his son Mr. George, on their way to the harbour\nworks of Fraserburgh, in Aberdeenshire, paid a visit to the Bell Rock, in\na boat from Arbroath.  It being then too late in the tide for landing,\nthey remained on board of the Lighthouse yacht all night, when the\nwriter, who had now been secluded from society for several weeks, enjoyed\nmuch of Mr. Rennie’s interesting conversation, both on general topics,\nand professionally upon the progress of the Bell Rock works, on which he\nwas consulted as chief engineer.\n\n                                                       [Tuesday, 6th Oct.]\n\nThe artificers landed this morning at nine, after which one of the boats\nreturned to the ship for the writer and Messrs. Rennie, who, upon\nlanding, were saluted with a display of the colours from the beacon and\nby three cheers from the workmen.  Everything was now in a prepared state\nfor leaving the rock, and giving up the works afloat for this season,\nexcepting some small articles, which would still occupy the smiths and\njoiners for a few days longer.  They accordingly shifted on board of the\n_Smeaton_, while the yacht left the rock for Arbroath, with Messrs.\nRennie, the writer, and the remainder of the artificers.  But, before\ntaking leave, the steward served out a farewell glass, when three hearty\ncheers were given, and an earnest wish expressed that everything, in the\nspring of 1808, might be found in the same state of good order as it was\nnow about to be left.\n\n\n\nII—OPERATIONS OF 1808\n\n\n                                                       [Monday, 29th Feb.]\n\nThe writer sailed from Arbroath at one a.m. in the Lighthouse yacht.  At\nseven the floating light was hailed, and all on board found to be well.\nThe crew were observed to have a very healthy-like appearance, and looked\nbetter than at the close of the works upon the rock.  They seemed only to\nregret one thing, which was the secession of their cook, Thomas\nElliot—not on account of his professional skill, but for his facetious\nand curious manner.  Elliot had something peculiar in his history, and\nwas reported by his comrades to have seen better days.  He was, however,\nhappy with his situation on board of the floating light, and, having a\ntaste for music, dancing, and acting plays, he contributed much to the\namusement of the ship’s company in their dreary abode during the winter\nmonths.  He had also recommended himself to their notice as a good\nshipkeeper, for as it did not answer Elliot to go often ashore, he had\nalways given up his turn of leave to his neighbours.  At his own desire\nhe was at length paid off, when he had a considerable balance of wages to\nreceive, which he said would be sufficient to carry him to the West\nIndies, and he accordingly took leave of the Lighthouse service.\n\n                                                      [Tuesday, 1st March]\n\nAt daybreak the Lighthouse yacht, attended by a boat from the floating\nlight, again stood towards the Bell Rock.  The weather felt extremely\ncold this morning, the thermometer being at 34 degrees, with the wind at\neast, accompanied by occasional showers of snow, and the marine barometer\nindicated 29.80.  At half-past seven the sea ran with such force upon the\nrock that it seemed doubtful if a landing could be effected.  At\nhalf-past eight, when it was fairly above water, the writer took his\nplace in the floating light’s boat with the artificers, while the yacht’s\nboat followed, according to the general rule of having two boats afloat\nin landing expeditions of this kind, that, in case of accident to one\nboat, the other might assist.  In several unsuccessful attempts the boats\nwere beat back by the breach of the sea upon the rock.  On the eastern\nside it separated into two distinct waves, which came with a sweep round\nto the western side, where they met; and at the instance of their\nconfluence the water rose in spray to a considerable height.  Watching\nwhat the sailors term a _smooth_, we caught a favourable opportunity, and\nin a very dexterous manner the boats were rowed between the two seas, and\nmade a favourable landing at the western creek.\n\nAt the latter end of last season, as was formerly noticed, the beacon was\npainted white, and from the bleaching of the weather and the sprays of\nthe sea the upper parts were kept clean; but within the range of the tide\nthe principal beams were observed to be thickly coated with a green\nstuff, the _conferva_ of botanists.  Notwithstanding the intrusion of\nthese works, which had formerly banished the numerous seals that played\nabout the rock, they were now seen in great numbers, having been in an\nalmost undisturbed state for six months.  It had now also, for the first\ntime, got some inhabitants of the feathered tribe: in particular the\nscarth or cormorant, and the large herring-gull, had made the beacon a\nresting-place, from its vicinity to their fishing-grounds.  About a dozen\nof these birds had rested upon the cross-beams, which, in some places,\nwere coated with their dung; and their flight, as the boats approached,\nwas a very unlooked-for indication of life and habitation on the Bell\nRock, conveying the momentary idea of the conversion of this fatal rock,\nfrom being a terror to the mariner, into a residence of man and a\nsafeguard to shipping.\n\nUpon narrowly examining the great iron stanchions with which the beams\nwere fixed to the rock, the writer had the satisfaction of finding that\nthere was not the least appearance of working or shifting at any of the\njoints or places of connection; and, excepting the loosening of the\nbracing-chains, everything was found in the same entire state in which it\nhad been left in the month of October.  This, in the estimation of the\nwriter, was a matter of no small importance to the future success of the\nwork.  He from that moment saw the practicability and propriety of\nfitting up the beacon, not only as a place of refuge in case of accident\nto the boats in landing, but as a residence for the artificers during the\nworking months.\n\nWhile upon the top of the beacon the writer was reminded by the\nlanding-master that the sea was running high, and that it would be\nnecessary to set off while the rock afforded anything like shelter to the\nboats, which by this time had been made fast by a long line to the\nbeacon, and rode with much agitation, each requiring two men with\nboat-hooks to keep them from striking each other, or from ranging up\nagainst the beacon.  But even under these circumstances the greatest\nconfidence was felt by every one, from the security afforded by this\ntemporary erection.  For, supposing the wind had suddenly increased to a\ngale, and that it had been found unadvisable to go into the boats; or,\nsupposing they had drifted or sprung a leak from striking upon the rocks;\nin any of these possible and not at all improbable cases, those who might\nthus have been left upon the rock had now something to lay hold of, and,\nthough occupying this dreary habitation of the sea-gull and the\ncormorant, affording only bread and water, yet _life_, would be\npreserved, and the mind would still be supported by the hope of being\nultimately relieved.\n\n                                                     [Wednesday, 25th May]\n\nOn the 25th of May the writer embarked at Arbroath, on board of the _Sir\nJoseph Banks_, for the Bell Rock, accompanied by Mr. Logan senior,\nforeman builder, with twelve masons and two smiths, together with\nthirteen seamen, including the master, mate, and steward.\n\n                                                      [Thursday, 26th May]\n\nMr. James Wilson, now commander of the _Pharos_, floating light, and\nlanding-master, in the room of Mr. Sinclair, who had left the service,\ncame into the writer’s cabin this morning at six o’clock, and intimated\nthat there was a good appearance of landing on the rock.  Everything\nbeing arranged, both boats proceeded in company, and at eight a.m. they\nreached the rock.  The lighthouse colours were immediately hoisted upon\nthe flagstaff of the beacon, a compliment which was duly returned by the\ntender and floating light, when three hearty cheers were given, and a\nglass of rum was served out to all hands to drink success to the\noperations of 1808.\n\n                                                        [Friday, 27th May]\n\nThis morning the wind was at east, blowing a fresh gale, the weather\nbeing hazy, with a considerable breach of sea setting in upon the rock.\nThe morning bell was therefore rung, in some doubt as to the\npracticability of making a landing.  After allowing the rock to get fully\nup, or to be sufficiently left by the tide, that the boats might have\nsome shelter from the range of the sea, they proceeded at 8 a.m., and\nupon the whole made a pretty good landing; and after two hours and\nthree-quarters’ work returned to the ship in safety.\n\nIn the afternoon the wind considerably increased, and, as a pretty heavy\nsea was still running, the tender rode very hard, when Mr. Taylor, the\ncommander, found it necessary to take in the bowsprit, and strike the\nfore and main topmasts, that she might ride more easily.  After\nconsulting about the state of the weather, it was resolved to leave the\nartificers on board this evening, and carry only the smiths to the rock,\nas the sharpening of the irons was rather behind, from their being so\nmuch broken and blunted by the hard and tough nature of the rock, which\nbecame much more compact and hard as the depth of excavation was\nincreased.  Besides avoiding the risk of encumbering the boats with a\nnumber of men who had not yet got the full command of the oar in a breach\nof sea, the writer had another motive for leaving them behind.  He wanted\nto examine the site of the building without interruption, and to take the\ncomparative levels of the different inequalities of its area; and as it\nwould have been painful to have seen men standing idle upon the Bell\nRock, where all moved with activity, it was judged better to leave them\non board.  The boats landed at half-past seven p.m., and the\nlanding-master, with the seamen, was employed during this tide in cutting\nthe seaweeds from the several paths leading to the landing-places, to\nrender walking more safe, for, from the slippery state of the surface of\nthe rock, many severe tumbles had taken place.  In the meantime the\nwriter took the necessary levels, and having carefully examined the site\nof the building and considered all its parts, it still appeared to be\nnecessary to excavate to the average depth of fourteen inches over the\nwhole area of the foundation.\n\n                                                      [Saturday, 28th May]\n\nThe wind still continued from the eastward with a heavy swell; and to-day\nit was accompanied with foggy weather and occasional showers of rain.\nNotwithstanding this, such was the confidence which the erection of the\nbeacon had inspired that the boats landed the artificers on the rock\nunder very unpromising circumstances, at half-past eight, and they\ncontinued at work till half-past eleven, being a period of three hours,\nwhich was considered a great tide’s work in the present low state of the\nfoundation.  Three of the masons on board were so afflicted with\nsea-sickness that they had not been able to take any food for almost\nthree days, and they were literally assisted into the boats this morning\nby their companions.  It was, however, not a little surprising to see how\nspeedily these men revived upon landing on the rock and eating a little\ndulse.  Two of them afterwards assisted the sailors in collecting the\nchips of stone and carrying them out of the way of the pickmen; but the\nthird complained of a pain in his head, and was still unable to do\nanything.  Instead of returning to the tender with the boats, these three\nmen remained on the beacon all day, and had their victuals sent to them\nalong with the smiths’.  From Mr. Dove, the foreman smith, they had much\nsympathy, for he preferred remaining on the beacon at all hazards, to be\nhimself relieved from the malady of sea-sickness.  The wind continuing\nhigh, with a heavy sea, and the tide falling late, it was not judged\nproper to land the artificers this evening, but in the twilight the boats\nwere sent to fetch the people on board who had been left on the rock.\n\n                                                        [Sunday, 29th May]\n\nThe wind was from the S.W. to-day, and the signal-bell rung, as usual,\nabout an hour before the period for landing on the rock.  The writer was\nrather surprised, however, to hear the landing-master repeatedly call,\n‘All hands for the rock!’ and, coming on deck, he was disappointed to\nfind the seamen only in the boats.  Upon inquiry, it appeared that some\nmisunderstanding had taken place about the wages of the artificers for\nSundays.  They had preferred wages for seven days statedly to the former\nmode of allowing a day for each tide’s work on Sunday, as they did not\nlike the appearance of working for double or even treble wages on Sunday,\nand would rather have it understood that their work on that day arose\nmore from the urgency of the case than with a view to emolument.  This\nhaving been judged creditable to their religious feelings, and readily\nadjusted to their wish, the boats proceeded to the rock, and the work\ncommenced at nine a.m.\n\n                                                        [Monday, 30th May]\n\nMr. Francis Watt commenced, with five joiners, to fit up a temporary\nplatform upon the beacon, about twenty-five feet above the highest part\nof the rock.  This platform was to be used as the site of the smith’s\nforge, after the beacon should be fitted up as a barrack; and here also\nthe mortar was to be mixed and prepared for the building, and it was\naccordingly termed the Mortar Gallery.\n\nThe landing-master’s crew completed the discharging from the _Smeaton_ of\nher cargo of the cast-iron rails and timber.  It must not here be omitted\nto notice that the _Smeaton_ took in ballast from the Bell Rock,\nconsisting of the shivers or chips of stone produced by the workmen in\npreparing the site of the building, which were now accumulating in great\nquantities on the rock.  These the boats loaded, after discharging the\niron.  The object in carrying off these chips, besides ballasting the\nvessel, was to get them permanently out of the way, as they were apt to\nshift about from place to place with every gale of wind; and it often\nrequired a considerable time to clear the foundation a second time of\nthis rubbish.  The circumstance of ballasting a ship at the Bell Rock\nafforded great entertainment, especially to the sailors; and it was\nperhaps with truth remarked that the _Smeaton_ was the first vessel that\nhad ever taken on board ballast at the Bell Rock.  Mr. Pool, the\ncommander of this vessel, afterwards acquainted the writer that, when the\nballast was landed upon the quay at Leith, many persons carried away\nspecimens of it, as part of a cargo from the Bell Rock; when he added,\nthat such was the interest excited, from the number of specimens carried\naway, that some of his friends suggested that he should have sent the\nwhole to the Cross of Edinburgh, where each piece might have sold for a\npenny.\n\n                                                       [Tuesday, 31st May]\n\nIn the evening the boats went to the rock, and brought the joiners and\nsmiths, and their sickly companions, on board of the tender.  These also\nbrought with them two baskets full of fish, which they had caught at\nhigh-water from the beacon, reporting, at the same time, to their\ncomrades, that the fish were swimming in such numbers over the rock at\nhigh-water that it was completely hid from their sight, and nothing seen\nbut the movement of thousands of fish.  They were almost exclusively of\nthe species called the podlie, or young coal-fish.  This discovery, made\nfor the first time to-day by the workmen, was considered fortunate, as an\nadditional circumstance likely to produce an inclination among the\nartificers to take up their residence in the beacon, when it came to be\nfitted up as a barrack.\n\n                                                       [Tuesday, 7th June]\n\nAt three o’clock in the morning the ship’s bell was rung as the signal\nfor landing at the rock.  When the landing was to be made before\nbreakfast, it was customary to give each of the artificers and seamen a\ndram and a biscuit, and coffee was prepared by the steward for the\ncabins.  Exactly at four o’clock the whole party landed from three boats,\nincluding one of those belonging to the floating light, with a part of\nthat ship’s crew, which always attended the works in moderate weather.\nThe landing-master’s boat, called the _Seaman_, but more commonly called\nthe _Lifeboat_, took the lead.  The next boat, called the _Mason_, was\ngenerally steered by the writer; while the floating light’s boat,\n_Pharos_, was under the management of the boatswain of that ship.\n\nHaving now so considerable a party of workmen and sailors on the rock, it\nmay be proper here to notice how their labours were directed.\nPreparations having been made last month for the erection of a second\nforge upon the beacon, the smiths commenced their operations both upon\nthe lower and higher platforms.  They were employed in sharpening the\npicks and irons for the masons, and in making bats and other apparatus of\nvarious descriptions connected with the fitting of the railways.  The\nlanding-master’s crew were occupied in assisting the millwrights in\nlaying the railways to hand.  Sailors, of all other descriptions of men,\nare the most accommodating in the use of their hands.  They worked freely\nwith the boring-irons, and assisted in all the operations of the\nrailways, acting by turns as boatmen, seamen, and artificers.  We had no\nsuch character on the Bell Rock as the common labourer.  All the\noperations of this department were cheerfully undertaken by the seamen,\nwho, both on the rock and on shipboard, were the inseparable companions\nof every work connected with the erection of the Bell Rock Lighthouse.\nIt will naturally be supposed that about twenty-five masons, occupied\nwith their picks in executing and preparing the foundation of the\nlighthouse, in the course of a tide of about three hours, would make a\nconsiderable impression upon an area even of forty-two feet in diameter.\nBut in proportion as the foundation was deepened, the rock was found to\nbe much more hard and difficult to work, while the baling and pumping of\nwater became much more troublesome.  A joiner was kept almost constantly\nemployed in fitting the picks to their handles, which, as well as the\npoints to the irons, were very frequently broken.\n\nThe Bell Rock this morning presented by far the most busy and active\nappearance it had exhibited since the erection of the principal beams of\nthe beacon.  The surface of the rock was crowded with men, the two forges\nflaming, the one above the other, upon the beacon, while the anvils\nthundered with the rebounding noise of their wooden supports, and formed\na curious contrast with the occasional clamour of the surges.  The wind\nwas westerly, and the weather being extremely agreeable, as soon after\nbreakfast as the tide had sufficiently overflowed the rock to float the\nboats over it, the smiths, with a number of the artificers, returned to\nthe beacon, carrying their fishing-tackle along with them.  In the course\nof the forenoon, the beacon exhibited a still more extraordinary\nappearance than the rock had done in the morning.  The sea being smooth,\nit seemed to be afloat upon the water, with a number of men supporting\nthemselves in all the variety of attitude and position: while, from the\nupper part of this wooden house, the volumes of smoke which ascended from\nthe forges gave the whole a very curious and fanciful appearance.\n\nIn the course of this tide it was observed that a heavy swell was setting\nin from the eastward, and the appearance of the sky indicated a change of\nweather, while the wind was shifting about.  The barometer also had\nfallen from 30 in. to 29.6.  It was, therefore, judged prudent to shift\nthe vessel to the S.W. or more distant buoy.  Her bowsprit was also soon\nafterwards taken in, the topmasts struck, and everything made _snug_, as\nseamen term it, for a gale.  During the course of the night the wind\nincreased and shifted to the eastward, when the vessel rolled very hard,\nand the sea often broke over her bows with great force.\n\n                                                     [Wednesday, 8th June]\n\nAlthough the motion of the tender was much less than that of the floating\nlight—at least, in regard to the rolling motion—yet she _sended_, or\npitched, much.  Being also of a very handsome build, and what seamen term\nvery _clean aft_, the sea often struck the counter with such force that\nthe writer, who possessed the aftermost cabin, being unaccustomed to this\nnew vessel, could not divest himself of uneasiness; for when her stern\nfell into the sea, it struck with so much violence as to be more like the\nresistance of a rock than the sea.  The water, at the same time, often\nrushed with great force up the rudder-case, and, forcing up the valve of\nthe water-closet, the floor of his cabin was at times laid under water.\nThe gale continued to increase, and the vessel rolled and pitched in such\na manner that the hawser by which the tender was made fast to the buoy\nsnapped, and she went adrift.  In the act of swinging round to the wind\nshe shipped a very heavy sea, which greatly alarmed the artificers, who\nimagined that we had got upon the rock; but this, from the direction of\nthe wind, was impossible.  The writer, however, sprung upon deck, where\nhe found the sailors busily employed in rigging out the bowsprit and in\nsetting sail.  From the easterly direction of the wind, it was considered\nmost advisable to steer for the Firth of Forth, and there wait a change\nof weather.  At two p.m. we accordingly passed the Isle of May, at six\nanchored in Leith Roads, and at eight the writer landed, when he came in\nupon his friends, who were not a little surprised at his unexpected\nappearance, which gave an instantaneous alarm for the safety of things at\nthe Bell Rock.\n\n                                                      [Thursday, 9th June]\n\nThe wind still continued to blow very hard at E. by N., and the _Sir\nJoseph Banks_ rode heavily, and even drifted with both anchors ahead, in\nLeith Roads.  The artificers did not attempt to leave the ship last\nnight; but there being upwards of fifty people on board, and the decks\ngreatly lumbered with the two large boats, they were in a very crowded\nand impatient state on board.  But to-day they got ashore, and amused\nthemselves by walking about the streets of Edinburgh, some in very humble\napparel, from having only the worst of their jackets with them, which,\nthough quite suitable for their work, were hardly fit for public\ninspection, being not only tattered, but greatly stained with the red\ncolour of the rock.\n\n                                                       [Friday, 10th June]\n\nTo-day the wind was at S.E., with light breezes and foggy weather.  At\nsix a.m. the writer again embarked for the Bell Rock, when the vessel\nimmediately sailed.  At eleven p.m., there being no wind, the\nkedge-anchor was _let go_ off Anstruther, one of the numerous towns on\nthe coast of Fife, where we waited the return of the tide.\n\n                                                     [Saturday, 11th June]\n\nAt six a.m. the _Sir Joseph_ got under weigh, and at eleven was again\nmade fast to the southern buoy at the Bell Rock.  Though it was now late\nin the tide, the writer, being anxious to ascertain the state of things\nafter the gale, landed with the artificers to the number of forty-four.\nEverything was found in an entire state; but, as the tide was nearly\ngone, only half an hour’s work had been got when the site of the building\nwas overflowed.  In the evening the boats again landed at nine, and after\na good tide’s work of three hours with torchlight, the work was left off\nat midnight.  To the distant shipping the appearance of things under\nnight on the Bell Rock, when the work was going forward, must have been\nvery remarkable, especially to those who were strangers to the\noperations.  Mr. John Reid, principal lightkeeper, who also acted as\nmaster of the floating light during the working months at the rock,\ndescribed the appearance of numerous lights situated so low in the water,\nwhen seen at the distance of two or three miles, as putting him in mind\nof Milton’s description of the fiends in the lower regions, adding, ‘for\nit seems greatly to surpass Will-o’-the-Wisp, or any of those earthly\nspectres of which we have so often heard.’\n\n                                                       [Monday, 13th June]\n\nFrom the difficulties attending the landing on the rock, owing to the\nbreach of sea which had for days past been around it, the artificers\nshowed some backwardness at getting into the boats this morning; but\nafter a little explanation this was got over.  It was always observable\nthat for some time after anything like danger had occurred at the rock,\nthe workmen became much more cautious, and on some occasions their\ntimidity was rather troublesome.  It fortunately happened, however, that\nalong with the writer’s assistants and the sailors there were also some\nof the artificers themselves who felt no such scruples, and in this way\nthese difficulties were the more easily surmounted.  In matters where\nlife is in danger it becomes necessary to treat even unfounded prejudices\nwith tenderness, as an accident, under certain circumstances, would not\nonly have been particularly painful to those giving directions, but have\nproved highly detrimental to the work, especially in the early stages of\nits advancement.\n\nAt four o’clock fifty-eight persons landed; but the tides being extremely\nlanguid, the water only left the higher parts of the rock, and no work\ncould be done at the site of the building.  A third forge was, however,\nput in operation during a short time, for the greater conveniency of\nsharpening the picks and irons, and for purposes connected with the\npreparations for fixing the railways on the rock.  The weather towards\nthe evening became thick and foggy, and there was hardly a breath of wind\nto ruffle the surface of the water.  Had it not, therefore, been for the\nnoise from the anvils of the smiths who had been left on the beacon\nthroughout the day, which afforded a guide for the boats, a landing could\nnot have been attempted this evening, especially with such a company of\nartificers.  This circumstance confirmed the writer’s opinion with regard\nto the propriety of connecting large bells to be rung with machinery in\nthe lighthouse, to be tolled day and night during the continuance of\nfoggy weather.\n\n                                                     [Thursday, 23rd June]\n\nThe boats landed this evening, when the artificers had again two hours’\nwork.  The weather still continuing very thick and foggy, more difficulty\nwas experienced in getting on board of the vessels to-night than had\noccurred on any previous occasion, owing to a light breeze of wind which\ncarried the sound of the bell, and the other signals made on board of the\nvessels, away from the rock.  Having fortunately made out the position of\nthe sloop _Smeaton_ at the N.E. buoy—to which we were much assisted by\nthe barking of the ship’s dog,—we parted with the _Smeaton’s_ boat, when\nthe boats of the tender took a fresh departure for that vessel, which lay\nabout half a mile to the south-westward.  Yet such is the very deceiving\nstate of the tides, that, although there was a small binnacle and compass\nin the landing-master’s boat, we had, nevertheless, passed the _Sir\nJoseph_ a good way, when, fortunately, one of the sailors catched the\nsound of a blowing-horn.  The only fire-arms on board were a pair of\nswivels of one-inch calibre; but it is quite surprising how much the\nsound is lost in foggy weather, as the report was heard but at a very\nshort distance.  The sound from the explosion of gunpowder is so\ninstantaneous that the effect of the small guns was not so good as either\nthe blowing of a horn or the tolling of a bell, which afforded a more\nconstant and steady direction for the pilot.\n\n                                                     [Wednesday, 6th July]\n\nLanded on the rock with the three boats belonging to the tender at five\np.m., and began immediately to bale the water out of the foundation-pit\nwith a number of buckets, while the pumps were also kept in action with\nrelays of artificers and seamen.  The work commenced upon the higher\nparts of the foundation as the water left them, but it was now pretty\ngenerally reduced to a level.  About twenty men could be conveniently\nemployed at each pump, and it is quite astonishing in how short a time so\ngreat a body of water could be drawn off.  The water in the\nfoundation-pit at this time measured about two feet in depth, on an area\nof forty-two feet in diameter, and yet it was drawn off in the course of\nabout half an hour.  After this the artificers commenced with their picks\nand continued at work for two hours and a half, some of the sailors being\nat the same time busily employed in clearing the foundation of chips and\nin conveying the irons to and from the smiths on the beacon, where they\nwere sharped.  At eight o’clock the sea broke in upon us and overflowed\nthe foundation-pit, when the boats returned to the tender.\n\n                                                      [Thursday, 7th July]\n\nThe landing-master’s bell rung this morning about four o’clock, and at\nhalf-past five, the foundation being cleared, the work commenced on the\nsite of the building.  But from the moment of landing, the squad of\njoiners and millwrights was at work upon the higher parts of the rock in\nlaying the railways, while the anvils of the smith resounded on the\nbeacon, and such columns of smoke ascended from the forges that they were\noften mistaken by strangers at a distance for a ship on fire.  After\ncontinuing three hours at work the foundation of the building was again\noverflowed, and the boats returned to the ship at half-past eight\no’clock. the masons and pickmen had, at this period, a pretty long day on\nboard of the tender, but the smiths and joiners were kept constantly at\nwork upon the beacon, the stability and great conveniency of which had\nnow been so fully shown that no doubt remained as to the propriety of\nfitting it up as a barrack.  The workmen were accordingly employed,\nduring the period of high-water, in making preparations for this purpose.\n\nThe foundation-pit now assumed the appearance of a great platform, and\nthe late tides had been so favourable that it became apparent that the\nfirst course, consisting of a few irregular and detached stones for\nmaking up certain inequalities in the interior parts of the site of the\nbuilding, might be laid in the course of the present spring-tides.\nHaving been enabled to-day to get the dimensions of the foundation, or\nfirst stone, accurately taken, a mould was made of its figure, when the\nwriter left the rock, after the tide’s work of this morning, in a fast\nrowing-boat for Arbroath; and, upon landing, two men were immediately set\nto work upon one of the blocks from Mylnefield quarry, which was prepared\nin the course of the following day, as the stone-cutters relieved each\nother, and worked both night and day, so that it was sent off in one of\nthe stone-lighters without delay.\n\n                                                      [Saturday, 9th July]\n\nThe site of the foundation-stone was very difficult to work, from its\ndepth in the rock; but being now nearly prepared, it formed a very\nagreeable kind of pastime at high-water for all hands to land the stone\nitself upon the rock.  The landing-master’s crew and artificers\naccordingly entered with great spirit into this operation.  The stone was\nplaced upon the deck of the _Hedderwick_ praam-boat, which had just been\nbrought from Leith, and was decorated with colours for the occasion.\nFlags were also displayed from the shipping in the offing, and upon the\nbeacon.  Here the writer took his station with the greater part of the\nartificers, who supported themselves in every possible position while the\nboats towed the praam from her moorings and brought her immediately over\nthe site of the building, where her grappling anchors were let go.  The\nstone was then lifted off the deck by a tackle hooked into a Lewis bat\ninserted into it, when it was gently lowered into the water and grounded\non the site of the building, amidst the cheering acclamations of about\nsixty persons.\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 10th July]\n\nAt eleven o’clock the foundation-stone was laid to hand.  It was of a\nsquare form, containing about twenty cubic feet, and had the figures, or\ndate, of 1808 simply cut upon it with a chisel.  A derrick, or spar of\ntimber, having been erected at the edge of the hole and guyed with ropes,\nthe stone was then hooked to the tackle and lowered into its place, when\nthe writer, attended by his assistants—Mr. Peter Logan, Mr. Francis Watt,\nand Mr. James Wilson,—applied the square, the level, and the mallet, and\npronounced the following benediction: ‘May the great Architect of the\nUniverse complete and bless this building,’ on which three hearty cheers\nwere given, and success to the future operations was drunk with the\ngreatest enthusiasm.\n\n                                                      [Tuesday, 26th July]\n\nThe wind being at S.E. this evening, we had a pretty heavy swell of sea\nupon the rock, and some difficulty attended our getting off in safety, as\nthe boats got aground in the creek and were in danger of being upset.\nUpon extinguishing the torchlights, about twelve in number, the darkness\nof the night seemed quite horrible; the water being also much charged\nwith the phosphorescent appearance which is familiar to every one on\nshipboard, the waves, as they dashed upon the rock, were in some degree\nlike so much liquid flame.  The scene, upon the whole, was truly awful!\n\n                                                    [Wednesday, 27th July]\n\nIn leaving the rock this evening everything, after the torches were\nextinguished, had the same dismal appearance as last night, but so\nperfectly acquainted were the landing-master and his crew with the\nposition of things at the rock, that comparatively little inconveniency\nwas experienced on these occasions when the weather was moderate; such is\nthe effect of habit, even in the most unpleasant situations.  If, for\nexample, it had been proposed to a person accustomed to a city life, at\nonce to take up his quarters off a sunken reef and land upon it in boats\nat all hours of the night, the proposition must have appeared quite\nimpracticable and extravagant; but this practice coming progressively\nupon the artificers, it was ultimately undertaken with the greatest\nalacrity.  Notwithstanding this, however, it must be acknowledged that it\nwas not till after much labour and peril, and many an anxious hour, that\nthe writer is enabled to state that the site of the Bell Rock Lighthouse\nis fully prepared for the first entire course of the building.\n\n                                                       [Friday, 12th Aug.]\n\nThe artificers landed this morning at half-past ten, and after an hour\nand a half’s work eight stones were laid, which completed the first\nentire course of the building, consisting of 123 blocks, the last of\nwhich was laid with three hearty cheers.\n\n                                                    [Saturday, 10th Sept.]\n\nLanded at nine a.m., and by a quarter-past twelve noon twenty-three\nstones had been laid.  The works being now somewhat elevated by the lower\ncourses, we got quit of the very serious inconvenience of pumping water\nto clear the foundation-pit.  This gave much facility to the operations,\nand was noticed with expressions of as much happiness by the artificers\nas the seamen had shown when relieved of the continual trouble of\ncarrying the smith’s bellows off the rock prior to the erection of the\nbeacon.\n\n                                                   [Wednesday, 21st Sept.]\n\nMr. Thomas Macurich, mate of the _Smeaton_, and James Scott, one of the\ncrew, a young man about eighteen years of age, immediately went into\ntheir boat to make fast a hawser to the ring in the top of the floating\nbuoy of the moorings, and were forthwith to proceed to land their cargo,\nso much wanted, at the rock.  The tides at this period were very strong,\nand the mooring-chain, when sweeping the ground, had caught hold of a\nrock or piece of wreck by which the chain was so shortened that when the\ntide flowed the buoy got almost under water, and little more than the\nring appeared at the surface.  When Macurich and Scott were in the act of\nmaking the hawser fast to the ring, the chain got suddenly disentangled\nat the bottom, and this large buoy, measuring about seven feet in height\nand three feet in diameter at the middle, tapering to both ends, being\nwhat seamen term a _Nun-buoy_, vaulted or sprung up with such force that\nit upset the boat, which instantly filled with water.  Mr. Macurich, with\nmuch exertion, succeeded in getting hold of the boat’s gunwale, still\nabove the surface of the water, and by this means was saved; but the\nyoung man Scott was unfortunately drowned.  He had in all probability\nbeen struck about the head by the ring of the buoy, for although\nsurrounded with the oars and the thwarts of the boat which floated near\nhim, yet he seemed entirely to want the power of availing himself of such\nassistance, and appeared to be quite insensible, while Pool, the master\nof the _Smeaton_, called loudly to him; and before assistance could be\ngot from the tender, he was carried away by the strength of the current\nand disappeared.\n\nThe young man Scott was a great favourite in the service, having had\nsomething uncommonly mild and complaisant in his manner; and his loss was\ntherefore universally regretted.  The circumstances of his case were also\npeculiarly distressing to his mother, as her husband, who was a seaman,\nhad for three years past been confined to a French prison, and the\ndeceased was the chief support of the family.  In order in some measure\nto make up the loss to the poor woman for the monthly aliment regularly\nallowed her by her late son, it was suggested that a younger boy, a\nbrother of the deceased, might be taken into the service.  This appeared\nto be rather a delicate proposition, but it was left to the\nlanding-master to arrange according to circumstances; such was the\nresignation, and at the same time the spirit, of the poor woman, that she\nreadily accepted the proposal, and in a few days the younger Scott was\nactually afloat in the place of his brother.  On representing this\ndistressing case to the Board, the Commissioners were pleased to grant an\nannuity of £5 to Scott’s mother.\n\nThe _Smeaton_, not having been made fast to the buoy, had, with the\nebb-tide, drifted to leeward a considerable way eastward of the rock, and\ncould not, till the return of the flood-tide, be worked up to her\nmoorings, so that the present tide was lost, notwithstanding all\nexertions which had been made both ashore and afloat with this cargo.\nThe artificers landed at six a.m.; but, as no materials could be got upon\nthe rock this morning, they were employed in boring trenail holes and in\nvarious other operations, and after four hours’ work they returned on\nboard the tender.  When the _Smeaton_ got up to her moorings, the\nlanding-master’s crew immediately began to unload her.  There being too\nmuch wind for towing the praams in the usual way, they were warped to the\nrock in the most laborious manner by their windlasses, with successive\ngrapplings and hawsers laid out for this purpose.  At six p.m. the\nartificers landed, and continued at work till half-past ten, when the\nremaining seventeen stones were laid which completed the third entire\ncourse, or fourth of the lighthouse, with which the building operations\nwere closed for the season.\n\n\n\nIII—OPERATIONS OF 1809\n\n\n                                                     [Wednesday, 24th May]\n\nThe last night was the first that the writer, had passed in his old\nquarters on board of the floating light for about twelve months, when the\nweather was so fine and the sea so smooth that even here he felt but\nlittle or no motion, excepting at the turn of the tide, when the vessel\ngets into what the seamen term the _trough of the sea_.  At six a.m. Mr.\nWatt, who conducted the operations of the railways and beacon-house, had\nlanded with nine artificers.  At half-past one p.m. Mr. Peter Logan had\nalso landed with fifteen masons, and immediately proceeded to set up the\ncrane.  The sheer-crane or apparatus for lifting the stones out of the\npraam-boats at the eastern creek had been already erected, and the\nrailways now formed about two-thirds of an entire circle round the\nbuilding: some progress had likewise been made with the reach towards the\nwestern landing-place.  The floors being laid, the beacon now assumed the\nappearance of a habitation.  The _Smeaton_ was at her moorings, with the\n_Fernie_ praam-boat astern, for which she was laying down moorings, and\nthe tender being also at her station, the Bell Rock had again put on its\nformer busy aspect.\n\n                                                     [Wednesday, 31st May]\n\nThe landing-master’s bell, often no very favourite sound, rung at six\nthis morning; but on this occasion, it is believed, it was gladly\nreceived by all on board, as the welcome signal of the return of better\nweather.  The masons laid thirteen stones to-day, which the seamen had\nlanded, together with other building materials.  During these twenty-four\nhours the wind was from the south, blowing fresh breezes, accompanied\nwith showers of snow.  In the morning the snow showers were so thick that\nit was with difficulty the landing-master, who always steered the leading\nboat, could make his way to the rock through the drift.  But at the Bell\nRock neither snow nor rain, nor fog nor wind, retarded the progress of\nthe work, if unaccompanied by a heavy swell or breach of the sea.\n\nThe weather during the months of April and May had been uncommonly\nboisterous, and so cold that the thermometer seldom exceeded 40°, while\nthe barometer was generally about 29.50.  We had not only hail and sleet,\nbut the snow on the last day of May lay on the decks and rigging of the\nship to the depth of about three inches; and, although now entering upon\nthe month of June, the length of the day was the chief indication of\nsummer.  Yet such is the effect of habit, and such was the expertness of\nthe landing-master’s crew, that, even in this description of weather,\nseldom a tide’s work was lost.  Such was the ardour and zeal of the heads\nof the several departments at the rock, including Mr. Peter Logan,\nforeman builder, Mr. Francis Watt, foreman millwright, and Captain\nWilson, landing-master, that it was on no occasion necessary to address\nthem, excepting in the way of precaution or restraint.  Under these\ncircumstances, however, the writer not unfrequently felt considerable\nanxiety, of which this day’s experience will afford an example.\n\n                                                      [Thursday, 1st June]\n\nThis morning, at a quarter-past eight, the artificers were landed as\nusual, and, after three hours and three-quarters’ work, five stones were\nlaid, the greater part of this tide having been taken up in completing\nthe boring and trenailing of the stones formerly laid.  At noon the\nwriter, with the seamen and artificers, proceeded to the tender, leaving\non the beacon the joiners, and several of those who were troubled with\nsea-sickness—among whom was Mr. Logan, who remained with Mr.\nWatt—counting altogether eleven persons.  During the first and middle\nparts of these twenty-four hours the wind was from the east, blowing what\nthe seamen term ‘fresh breezes’; but in the afternoon it shifted to\nE.N.E., accompanied with so heavy a swell of sea that the _Smeaton_ and\ntender struck their topmasts, launched in their bolt-sprits, and ‘made\nall snug’ for a gale.  At four p.m. the _Smeaton_ was obliged to slip her\nmoorings, and passed the tender, drifting before the wind, with only the\nforesail set.  In passing, Mr. Pool hailed that he must run for the Firth\nof Forth to prevent the vessel from ‘riding under.’\n\nOn board of the tender the writer’s chief concern was about the eleven\nmen left upon the beacon.  Directions were accordingly given that\neverything about the vessel should be put in the best possible state, to\npresent as little resistance to the wind as possible, that she might have\nthe better chance of riding out the gale.  Among these preparations the\nbest bower cable was bent, so as to have a second anchor in readiness in\ncase the mooring-hawser should give way, that every means might be used\nfor keeping the vessel within sight of the prisoners on the beacon, and\nthereby keep them in as good spirits as possible.  From the same motive\nthe boats were kept afloat that they might be less in fear of the vessel\nleaving her station.  The landing-master had, however, repeatedly\nexpressed his anxiety for the safety of the boats, and wished much to\nhave them hoisted on board.  At seven p.m. one of the boats, as he\nfeared, was unluckily filled with sea from a wave breaking into her, and\nit was with great difficulty that she could be baled out and got on\nboard, with the loss of her oars, rudder, and loose thwarts.  Such was\nthe motion of the ship that in taking this boat on board her gunwale was\nstove in, and she otherwise received considerable damage.  Night\napproached, but it was still found quite impossible to go near the rock.\nConsulting, therefore, the safety of the second boat, she also was\nhoisted on board of the tender.\n\nAt this time the cabins of the beacon were only partially covered, and\nhad neither been provided with bedding nor a proper fireplace, while the\nstock of provisions was but slender.  In these uncomfortable\ncircumstances the people on the beacon were left for the night, nor was\nthe situation of those on board of the tender much better.  The rolling\nand pitching motion of the ship was excessive; and, excepting to those\nwho had been accustomed to a residence in the floating light, it seemed\nquite intolerable.  Nothing was heard but the hissing of the winds and\nthe creaking of the bulkheads or partitions of the ship; the night was,\ntherefore, spent in the most unpleasant reflections upon the condition of\nthe people on the beacon, especially in the prospect of the tender being\ndriven from her moorings.  But, even in such a case, it afforded some\nconsolation that the stability of the fabric was never doubted, and that\nthe boats of the floating light were at no great distance, and ready to\nrender the people on the rock the earliest assistance which the weather\nwould permit.  The writer’s cabin being in the sternmost part of the\nship, which had what sailors term a good entry, or was sharp built, the\nsea, as before noticed, struck her counter with so much violence that the\nwater, with a rushing noise, continually forced its way up the\nrudder-case, lifted the valve of the water-closet, and overran the cabin\nfloor.  In these circumstances daylight was eagerly looked for, and\nhailed with delight, as well by those afloat as by the artificers upon\nthe rock.\n\n                                                        [Friday, 2nd June]\n\nIn the course of the night the writer held repeated conversations with\nthe officer on watch, who reported that the weather continued much in the\nsame state, and that the barometer still indicated 29.20 inches.  At six\na.m. the landing-master considered the weather to have somewhat\nmoderated; and, from certain appearances of the sky, he was of opinion\nthat a change for the better would soon take place.  He accordingly\nproposed to attempt a landing at low-water, and either get the people off\nthe rock, or at least ascertain what state they were in.  At nine a.m. he\nleft the vessel with a boat well manned, carrying with him a supply of\ncooked provisions and a tea-kettle full of mulled port wine for the\npeople on the beacon, who had not had any regular diet for about thirty\nhours, while they were exposed during that period, in a great measure,\nboth to the winds and the sprays of the sea.  The boat having succeeded\nin landing, she returned at eleven a.m. with the artificers, who had got\noff with considerable difficulty, and who were heartily welcomed by all\non board.\n\nUpon inquiry it appeared that three of the stones last laid upon the\nbuilding had been partially lifted from their beds by the force of the\nsea, and were now held only by the trenails, and that the cast-iron\nsheer-crane had again been thrown down and completely broken.  With\nregard to the beacon, the sea at high-water had lifted part of the mortar\ngallery or lowest floor, and washed away all the lime-casks and other\nmovable articles from it; but the principal parts of this fabric had\nsustained no damage.  On pressing Messrs. Logan and Watt on the situation\nof things in the course of the night, Mr. Logan emphatically said: ‘That\nthe beacon had an _ill-faured_ {171a} _twist_ when the sea broke upon it\nat high-water, but that they were not very apprehensive of danger.’  On\ninquiring as to how they spent the night, it appeared that they had made\nshift to keep a small fire burning, and by means of some old sails\ndefended themselves pretty well from the sea sprays.\n\nIt was particularly mentioned that by the exertions of James Glen, one of\nthe joiners, a number of articles were saved from being washed off the\nmortar gallery.  Glen was also very useful in keeping up the spirits of\nthe forlorn party.  In the early part of life he had undergone many\ncurious adventures at sea, which he now recounted somewhat after the\nmanner of the tales of the _Arabian Nights_.  When one observed that the\nbeacon was a most comfortless lodging, Glen would presently introduce\nsome of his exploits and hardships, in comparison with which the state of\nthings at the beacon bore an aspect of comfort and happiness.  Looking to\ntheir slender stock of provisions, and their perilous and uncertain\nchance of speedy relief, he would launch out into an account of one of\nhis expeditions in the North Sea, when the vessel, being much disabled in\na storm, was driven before the wind with the loss of almost all their\nprovisions; and the ship being much infested with rats, the crew hunted\nthese vermin with great eagerness to help their scanty allowance.  By\nsuch means Glen had the address to make his companions, in some measure,\nsatisfied, or at least passive, with regard to their miserable prospects\nupon this half-tide rock in the middle of the ocean.  This incident is\nnoticed, more particularly, to show the effects of such a happy turn of\nmind, even under the most distressing and ill-fated circumstances.\n\n                                                     [Saturday, 17th June]\n\nAt eight a.m. the artificers and sailors, forty-five in number, landed on\nthe rock, and after four hours’ work seven stones were laid.  The\nremainder of this tide, from the threatening appearance of the weather,\nwas occupied in trenailing and making all things as secure as possible.\nAt twelve noon the rock and building were again overflowed, when the\nmasons and seamen went on board of the tender, but Mr. Watt, with his\nsquad of ten men, remained on the beacon throughout the day.  As it blew\nfresh from the N.W. in the evening, it was found impracticable either to\nland the building artificers or to take the artificers off the beacon,\nand they were accordingly left there all night, but in circumstances very\ndifferent from those of the 1st of this month.  The house, being now in a\nmore complete state, was provided with bedding, and they spent the night\npretty well, though they complained of having been much disturbed at the\ntime of high-water by the shaking and tremulous motion of their house and\nby the plashing noise of the sea upon mortar gallery.  Here James Glen’s\nversatile powers were again at work in cheering up those who seemed to be\nalarmed, and in securing everything as far as possible.  On this occasion\nhe had only to recall to the recollections of some of them the former\nnight which they had spent on the beacon, the wind and sea being then\nmuch higher, and their habitation in a far less comfortable state.\n\nThe wind still continuing to blow fresh from the N.W., at five p.m. the\nwriter caused a signal to be made from the tender for the _Smeaton and\nPatriot_ to slip their moorings, when they ran for Lunan Bay, an\nanchorage on the east side of the Redhead.  Those on board of the tender\nspent but a very rough night, and perhaps slept less soundly than their\ncompanions on the beacon, especially as the wind was at N.W., which\ncaused the vessel to ride with her stern towards the Bell Rock; so that,\nin the event of anything giving way, she could hardly have escaped being\nstranded upon it.\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 18th June]\n\nThe weather having moderated to-day, the wind shifted to the westward.\nAt a quarter-past nine a.m. the artificers landed from the tender and had\nthe pleasure to find their friends who had been left on the rock quite\nhearty, alleging that the beacon was the preferable quarters of the two.\n\n                                                     [Saturday, 24th June]\n\nMr. Peter Logan, the foreman builder, and his squad, twenty-one in\nnumber, landed this morning at three o’clock, and continued at work four\nhours and a quarter, and after laying seventeen stones returned to the\ntender.  At six a.m. Mr. Francis Watt and his squad of twelve men landed,\nand proceeded with their respective operations at the beacon and\nrailways, and were left on the rock during the whole day without the\nnecessity of having any communication with the tender, the kitchen of the\nbeacon-house being now fitted up.  It was to-day, also, that Peter\nFortune—a most obliging and well-known character in the Lighthouse\nservice—was removed from the tender to the beacon as cook and steward,\nwith a stock of provisions as ample as his limited store-room would\nadmit.\n\nWhen as many stones were built as comprised this day’s work, the demand\nfor mortar was proportionally increased, and the task of the\nmortar-makers on these occasions was both laborious and severe.  This\noperation was chiefly performed by John Watt—a strong, active quarrier by\nprofession,—who was a perfect character in his way, and extremely zealous\nin his department.  While the operations of the mortar-makers continued,\nthe forge upon the gallery was not generally in use; but, as the working\nhours of the builders extended with the height of the building, the forge\ncould not be so long wanted, and then a sad confusion often ensued upon\nthe circumscribed floor of the mortar gallery, as the operations of Watt\nand his assistants trenched greatly upon those of the smiths.  Under\nthese circumstances the boundary of the smiths was much circumscribed,\nand they were personally annoyed, especially in blowy weather, with the\ndust of the lime in its powdered state.  The mortar-makers, on the other\nhand, were often not a little distressed with the heat of the fire and\nthe sparks elicited on the anvil, and not unaptly complained that they\nwere placed between the ‘devil and the deep sea.’\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 25th June]\n\nThe work being now about ten feet in height, admitted of a rope-ladder\nbeing distended {174a} between the beacon and the building.  By this\n‘Jacob’s Ladder,’ as the seamen termed it, a communication was kept up\nwith the beacon while the rock was considerably under water.  One end of\nit being furnished with tackle-blocks, was fixed to the beams of the\nbeacon, at the level of the mortar gallery, while the further end was\nconnected with the upper course of the building by means of two Lewis\nbats which were lifted from course to course as the work advanced.  In\nthe same manner a rope furnished with a travelling pulley was distended\nfor the purpose of transporting the mortar-buckets, and other light\narticles between the beacon and the building, which also proved a great\nconveniency to the work.  At this period the rope-ladder and tackle for\nthe mortar had a descent from the beacon to the building; by and by they\nwere on a level, and towards the end of the season, when the solid part\nhad attained its full height, the ascent was from the mortar gallery to\nthe building.\n\n                                                       [Friday, 30th June]\n\nThe artificers landed on the rock this morning at a quarter-past six, and\nremained at work five hours.  The cooking apparatus being now in full\noperation, all hands had breakfast on the beacon at the usual hour, and\nremained there throughout the day.  The crane upon the building had to be\nraised to-day from the eighth to the ninth course, an operation which now\nrequired all the strength that could be mustered for working the\nguy-tackles; for as the top of the crane was at this time about\nthirty-five feet above the rock, it became much more unmanageable.  While\nthe beam was in the act of swinging round from one guy to another, a\ngreat strain was suddenly brought upon the opposite tackle, with the end\nof which the artificers had very improperly neglected to take a turn\nround some stationary object, which would have given them the complete\ncommand of the tackle.  Owing to this simple omission, the crane got a\npreponderancy to one side, and fell upon the building with a terrible\ncrash.  The surrounding artificers immediately flew in every direction to\nget out of its way; but Michael Wishart, the principal builder, having\nunluckily stumbled upon one of the uncut trenails, fell upon his back.\nHis body fortunately got between the movable beam and the upright shaft\nof the crane, and was thus saved; but his feet got entangled with the\nwheels of the crane and were severely injured.  Wishart, being a robust\nyoung man, endured his misfortune with wonderful firmness; he was laid\nupon one of the narrow framed beds of the beacon and despatched in a boat\nto the tender, where the writer was when this accident happened, not a\nlittle alarmed on missing the crane from the top of the building, and at\nthe same time seeing a boat rowing towards the vessel with great speed.\nWhen the boat came alongside with poor Wishart, stretched upon a bed\ncovered with blankets, a moment of great anxiety followed, which was,\nhowever, much relieved when, on stepping into the boat, he was accosted\nby Wishart, though in a feeble voice, and with an aspect pale as death\nfrom excessive bleeding.  Directions having been immediately given to the\ncoxswain to apply to Mr. Kennedy at the workyard to procure the best\nsurgical aid, the boat was sent off without delay to Arbroath.  The\nwriter then landed at the rock, when the crane was in a very short time\ngot into its place and again put in a working state.\n\n                                                        [Monday, 3rd July]\n\nThe writer having come to Arbroath with the yacht, had an opportunity of\nvisiting Michael Wishart, the artificer who had met with so severe an\naccident at the rock on the 30th ult., and had the pleasure to find him\nin a state of recovery.  From Dr. Stevenson’s account, under whose charge\nhe had been placed, hopes were entertained that amputation would not be\nnecessary, as his patient still kept free of fever or any appearance of\nmortification; and Wishart expressed a hope that he might, at least, be\nultimately capable of keeping the light at the Bell Rock, as it was not\nnow likely that he would assist further in building the house.\n\n                                                      [Saturday, 8th July]\n\nIt was remarked to-day, with no small demonstration of joy, that the\ntide, being neap, did not, for the first time, overflow the building at\nhigh-water.  Flags were accordingly hoisted on the beacon-house, and\ncrane on the top of the building, which were repeated from the floating\nlight, Lighthouse yacht, tender, _Smeaton_, _Patriot_, and the two\npraams.  A salute of three guns was also fired from the yacht at\nhigh-water, when, all the artificers being collected on the top of the\nbuilding, three cheers were given in testimony of this important\ncircumstance.  A glass of rum was then served out to all hands on the\nrock and on board of the respective ships.\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 16th July]\n\nBesides laying, boring, trenailing, wedging, and grouting thirty-two\nstones, several other operations were proceeded with on the rock at\nlow-water, when some of the artificers were employed at the railways, and\nat high-water at the beacon-house.  The seamen having prepared a quantity\nof tarpaulin, or cloth laid over with successive coats of hot tar, the\njoiners had just completed the covering of the roof with it.  This sort\nof covering was lighter and more easily managed than sheet-lead in such a\nsituation.  As a further defence against the weather the whole exterior\nof this temporary residence was painted with three coats of white-lead\npaint.  Between the timber framing of the habitable part of the beacon\nthe interstices were to be stuffed with moss, as a light substance that\nwould resist dampness and check sifting winds; the whole interior was\nthen to be lined with green baize cloth, so that both without and within\nthe cabins were to have a very comfortable appearance.\n\nAlthough the building artificers generally remained on the rock\nthroughout the day, and the millwrights, joiners, and smiths, while their\nnumber was considerable, remained also during the night, yet the tender\nhad hitherto been considered as their night quarters.  But the wind\nhaving in the course of the day shifted to the N.W., and as the passage\nto the tender, in the boats, was likely to be attended with difficulty,\nthe whole of the artificers, with Mr. Logan, the foreman, preferred\nremaining all night on the beacon, which had of late become the solitary\nabode of George-Forsyth, a jobbing upholsterer, who had been employed in\nlining the beacon-house with cloth and in fitting up the bedding.\nForsyth was a tall, thin, and rather loose-made man, who had an utter\naversion at climbing upon the trap-ladders of the beacon, but especially\nat the process of boating, and the motion of the ship, which he said ‘was\ndeath itself.’  He therefore pertinaciously insisted with the\nlanding-master in being left upon the beacon, with a small black dog as\nhis only companion.  The writer, however, felt some delicacy in leaving a\nsingle individual upon the rock, who must have been so very helpless in\ncase of accident.  This fabric had, from the beginning, been rather\nintended by the writer to guard against accident from the loss or damage\nof a boat, and as a place for making mortar, a smith’s shop, and a store\nfor tools during the working months, than as permanent quarters; nor was\nit at all meant to be possessed until tile joiner-work was completely\nfinished, and his own cabin, and that for the foreman, in readiness, when\nit was still to be left to the choice of the artificers to occupy the\ntender or the beacon.  He, however, considered Forsyth’s partiality and\nconfidence in the latter as rather a fortunate occurrence.\n\n                                                    [Wednesday, 19th July]\n\nThe whole of the artificers, twenty-three in number, now removed of their\nown accord from the tender, to lodge in the beacon, together with Peter\nFortune, a person singularly adapted for a residence of this kind, both\nfrom the urbanity of his manners and the versatility of his talents.\nFortune, in his person, was of small stature, and rather corpulent.\nBesides being a good Scots cook, he had acted both as groom and\nhouse-servant; he had been a soldier, a sutler, a writer’s clerk, and an\napothecary, from which he possessed the art of writing and suggesting\nrecipes, and had hence, also, perhaps, acquired a turn for making\ncollections in natural history.  But in his practice in surgery on the\nBell Rock, for which he received an annual fee of three guineas, he is\nsupposed to have been rather partial to the use of the lancet.  In short,\nPeter was the _factotum_ of the beacon-house, where he ostensibly acted\nin the several capacities of cook, steward, surgeon, and barber, and kept\na statement of the rations or expenditure of the provisions with the\nstrictest integrity.\n\nIn the present important state of the building, when it had just attained\nthe height of sixteen feet, and the upper courses, and especially the\nimperfect one, were in the wash of the heaviest seas, an express boat\narrived at the rock with a letter from Mr. Kennedy, of the workyard,\nstating that in consequence of the intended expedition to Walcheren, an\nembargo had been laid on shipping at all the ports of Great Britain: that\nboth the _Smeaton_ and _Patriot_ were detained at Arbroath, and that but\nfor the proper view which Mr. Ramsey, the port officer, had taken of his\norders, neither the express boat nor one which had been sent with\nprovisions and necessaries for the floating light would have been\npermitted to leave the harbour.  The writer set off without delay for\nArbroath, and on landing used every possible means with the official\npeople, but their orders were deemed so peremptory that even boats were\nnot permitted to sail from any port upon the coast.  In the meantime, the\ncollector of the Customs at Montrose applied to the Board at Edinburgh,\nbut could, of himself, grant no relief to the Bell Rock shipping.\n\nAt this critical period Mr. Adam Duff, then Sheriff of Forfarshire, now\nof the county of Edinburgh, and _ex officio_ one of the Commissioners of\nthe Northern Lighthouses, happened to be at Arbroath.  Mr. Duff took an\nimmediate interest in representing the circumstances of the case to the\nBoard of Customs at Edinburgh.  But such were the doubts entertained on\nthe subject that, on having previously received the appeal from the\ncollector at Montrose, the case had been submitted to the consideration\nof the Lords of the Treasury, whose decision was now waited for.\n\nIn this state of things the writer felt particularly desirous to get the\nthirteenth course finished, that the building might be in a more secure\nstate in the event of bad weather.  An opportunity was therefore embraced\non the 25th, in sailing with provisions for the floating light, to carry\nthe necessary stones to the rock for this purpose, which were landed and\nbuilt on the 26th and 27th.  But so closely was the watch kept up that a\nCustom-house officer was always placed on board of the _Smeaton_ and\n_Patriot_ while they were afloat, till the embargo was especially removed\nfrom the lighthouse vessels.  The artificers at the Bell Rock had been\nreduced to fifteen, who were regularly supplied with provisions, along\nwith the crew of the floating light, mainly through the port officer’s\nliberal interpretation of his orders.\n\n                                                       [Tuesday, 1st Aug.]\n\nThere being a considerable swell and breach of sea upon the rock\nyesterday, the stones could not be got landed till the day following,\nwhen the wind shifted to the southward and the weather improved.  But\nto-day no less than seventy-eight blocks of stone were landed, of which\nforty were built, which completed the fourteenth and part of the\nfifteenth courses.  The number of workmen now resident in the\nbeacon-house was augmented to twenty-four, including the landing-master’s\ncrew from the tender and the boat’s crew from the floating light, who\nassisted at landing the stones.  Those daily at work upon the rock at\nthis period amounted to forty-six.  A cabin had been laid out for the\nwriter on the beacon, but his apartment had been the last which was\nfinished, and he had not yet taken possession of it; for though he\ngenerally spent the greater part of the day, at this time, upon the rock,\nyet he always slept on board of the tender.\n\n                                                       [Friday, 11th Aug.]\n\nThe wind was at S. E. on the 11th, and there was so very heavy a swell of\nsea upon the rock that no boat could approach it.\n\n                                                     [Saturday, 12th Aug.]\n\nThe gale still continuing from the S.E., the sea broke with great\nviolence both upon the building and the beacon.  The former being\ntwenty-three feet in height, the upper part of the crane erected on it\nhaving been lifted from course to course as the building advanced, was\nnow about thirty-six feet above the rock.  From observations made on the\nrise of the sea by this crane, the artificers were enabled to estimate\nits height to be about fifty feet above the rock, while the sprays fell\nwith a most alarming noise upon their cabins.  At low-water, in the\nevening, a signal was made from the beacon, at the earnest desire of some\nof the artificers, for the boats to come to the rock; and although this\ncould not be effected without considerable hazard, it was, however,\naccomplished, when twelve of their number, being much afraid, applied to\nthe foreman to be relieved, and went on board of the tender.  But the\nremaining fourteen continued on the rock, with Mr. Peter Logan, the\nforeman builder.  Although this rule of allowing an option to every man\neither to remain on the rock or return to the tender was strictly adhered\nto, yet, as it would have been extremely inconvenient to have the men\nparcelled out in this manner, it became necessary to embrace the first\nopportunity of sending those who had left the beacon to the workyard,\nwith as little appearance of intention as possible, lest it should hurt\ntheir feelings, or prevent others from acting according to their wishes,\neither in landing on the rock or remaining on the beacon.\n\n                                                      [Tuesday, 15th Aug.]\n\nThe wind had fortunately shifted to the S.W. this morning, and though a\nconsiderable breach was still upon the rock, yet the landing-master’s\ncrew were enabled to get one praam-boat, lightly loaded with five stones,\nbrought in safety to the western creek; these stones were immediately\nlaid by the artificers, who gladly embraced the return of good weather to\nproceed with their operations.  The writer had this day taken possession\nof his cabin in the beacon-house.  It was small, but commodious, and was\nfound particularly convenient in coarse and blowing weather, instead of\nbeing obliged to make a passage to the tender in an open boat at all\ntimes, both during the day and the night, which was often attended with\nmuch difficulty and danger.\n\n                                                     [Saturday, 19th Aug.]\n\nFor some days past the weather had been occasionally so thick and foggy\nthat no small difficulty was experienced in going even between the rock\nand the tender, though quite at hand.  But the floating light’s boat lost\nher way so far in returning on board that the first land she made, after\nrowing all night, was Fifeness, a distance of about fourteen miles.  The\nweather having cleared in the morning, the crew stood off again for the\nfloating light, and got on board in a half-famished and much exhausted\nstate, having been constantly rowing for about sixteen hours.\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 20th Aug.]\n\nThe weather being very favourable to-day, fifty-three stones were landed,\nand the builders were not a little gratified in having built the\ntwenty-second course, consisting of fifty-one stones, being the first\ncourse which had been completed in one day.  This, as a matter of course,\nproduced three hearty cheers.  At twelve noon prayers were read for the\nfirst time on the Bell Rock; those present, counting thirty, were crowded\ninto the upper apartment of the beacon, where the writer took a central\nposition, while two of the artificers, joining hands, supported the\nBible.\n\n                                                       [Friday, 25th Aug.]\n\nTo-day the artificers laid forty-five stones, which completed the\ntwenty-fourth course, reckoning above the first entire one, and the\ntwenty-sixth above the rock.  This finished the solid part of the\nbuilding, and terminated the height of the outward casing of granite,\nwhich is thirty-one feet six inches above the rock or site of the\nfoundation-stone, and about seventeen feet above high-water of\nspring-tides.  Being a particular crisis in the progress of the\nlighthouse, the landing and laying of the last stone for the season was\nobserved with the usual ceremonies.\n\nFrom observations often made by the writer, in so far as such can be\nascertained, it appears that no wave in the open seas, in an unbroken\nstate, rises more than from seven to nine feet above the general surface\nof the ocean.  The Bell Rock Lighthouse may therefore now be considered\nat from eight to ten feet above the height of the waves; and, although\nthe sprays and heavy seas have often been observed, in the present state\nof the building, to rise to the height of fifty feet, and fall with a\ntremendous noise on the beacon-house, yet such seas were not likely to\nmake any impression on a mass of solid masonry, containing about 1400\ntons,\n\n                                                    [Wednesday, 30th Aug.]\n\nThe whole of the artificers left the rock at mid-day, when the tender\nmade sail for Arbroath, which she reached about six p.m.  The vessel\nbeing decorated with colours, and having fired a salute of three guns on\napproaching the harbour, the workyard artificers, with a multitude of\npeople, assembled at the harbour, when mutual cheering and\ncongratulations took place between those afloat and those on the quays.\nThe tender had now, with little exception, been six months on the station\nat the Bell Rock, and during the last four months few of the squad of\nbuilders had been ashore.  In particular, Mr. Peter Logan, the foreman,\nand Mr. Robert Selkirk, principal builder, had never once left the rock.\nThe artificers, having made good wages during their stay, like seamen\nupon a return voyage, were extremely happy, and spent the evening with\nmuch innocent mirth and jollity.\n\nIn reflecting upon the state of the matters at the Bell Rock during the\nworking months, when the writer was much with the artificers, nothing can\nequal the happy manner in which these excellent workmen spent their time.\nThey always went from Arbroath to their arduous task cheering and they\ngenerally returned in the same hearty state.  While at the rock, between\nthe tides, they amused themselves in reading, fishing, music, playing\ncards, draughts, etc., or in sporting with one another.  In the workyard\nat Arbroath the young men were almost, without exception, employed in the\nevening at school, in writing and arithmetic, and not a few were learning\narchitectural drawing, for which they had every convenience and facility,\nand were, in a very obliging manner, assisted in their studies by Mr.\nDavid Logan, clerk of the works.  It therefore affords the most pleasing\nreflections to look back upon the pursuits of about sixty individuals who\nfor years conducted themselves, on all occasions, in a sober and rational\nmanner.\n\n\n\nIV—OPERATIONS OF 1810\n\n\n                                                      [Thursday, 10th May]\n\nThe wind had shifted to-day to W.N.W., when the writer, with considerable\ndifficulty, was enabled to land upon the rock for the first time this\nseason, at ten a.m.  Upon examining the state of the building, and\napparatus in general, he had the satisfaction to find everything in good\norder.  The mortar in all the joints was perfectly entire.  The building,\nnow thirty feet in height, was thickly coated with _fuci_ to the height\nof about fifteen feet, calculating from the rock: on the eastern side,\nindeed, the growth of seaweed was observable to the full height of thirty\nfeet, and even on the top or upper bed of the last-laid course,\nespecially towards the eastern side, it had germinated, so as to render\nwalking upon it somewhat difficult.\n\nThe beacon-house was in a perfectly sound state, and apparently just as\nit had been left in the month of November.  But the tides being neap, the\nlower parts, particularly where the beams rested on the rock, could not\nnow be seen.  The floor of the mortar gallery having been already laid\ndown by Mr. Watt and his men on a former visit, was merely soaked with\nthe sprays; but the joisting-beams which supported it had, in the course\nof the winter, been covered with a fine downy conferva produced by the\nrange of the sea.  They were also a good deal whitened with the mute of\nthe cormorant and other sea-fowls, which had roosted upon the beacon in\nwinter.  Upon ascending to the apartments, it was found that the motion\nof the sea had thrown open the door of the cook-house: this was only shut\nwith a single latch, that in case of shipwreck at the Bell Rock the\nmariner might find ready access to the shelter of this forlorn\nhabitation, where a supply of provisions was kept; and being within two\nmiles and a half of the floating light, a signal could readily be\nobserved, when a boat might be sent to his relief as the weather\npermitted.  An arrangement for this purpose formed one of the\ninstructions on board of the floating light, but happily no instance\noccurred for putting it in practice.  The hearth or fireplace of the\ncook-house was built of brick in as secure a manner as possible, to\nprevent accident from fire; but some of the plaster-work had shaken\nloose, from its damp state and the tremulous motion of the beacon in\nstormy weather.  The writer next ascended to the floor which was occupied\nby the cabins of himself and his assistants, which were in tolerably good\norder, having only a damp and musty smell.  The barrack for the\nartificers, over all, was next visited; it had now a very dreary and\ndeserted appearance when its former thronged state was recollected.  In\nsome parts the water had come through the boarding, and had discoloured\nthe lining of green cloth, but it was, nevertheless, in a good habitable\ncondition.  While the seamen were employed in landing a stock of\nprovisions, a few of the artificers set to work with great eagerness to\nsweep and clean the several apartments.  The exterior of the beacon was,\nin the meantime, examined, and found in perfect order.  The painting,\nthough it had a somewhat blanched appearance, adhered firmly both on the\nsides and roof, and only two or three panes of glass were broken in the\ncupola, which had either been blown out by the force of the wind, or\nperhaps broken by sea-fowl.\n\nHaving on this occasion continued upon the building and beacon a\nconsiderable time after the tide had begun to flow, the artificers were\noccupied in removing the forge from the top of the building, to which the\ngangway or wooden bridge gave great facility; and, although it stretched\nor had a span of forty-two feet, its construction was extremely simple,\nwhile the road-way was perfectly firm and steady.  In returning from this\nvisit to the rock every one was pretty well soused in spray before\nreaching the tender at two o’clock p.m., where things awaited the landing\nparty in as comfortable a way as such a situation would admit.\n\n                                                        [Friday, 11th May]\n\nThe wind was still easterly, accompanied with rather a heavy swell of sea\nfor the operations in hand.  A landing was, however, made this morning,\nwhen the artificers were immediately employed in scraping the seaweed off\nthe upper course of the building, in order to apply the moulds of the\nfirst course of the staircase, that the joggle-holes might be marked off\nin the upper course of the solid.  This was also necessary previously to\nthe writer’s fixing the position of the entrance door, which was\nregulated chiefly by the appearance of the growth of the seaweed on the\nbuilding, indicating the direction of the heaviest seas, on the opposite\nside of which the door was placed.  The landing-master’s crew succeeded\nin towing into the creek on the western side of the rock the praam-boat\nwith the balance-crane, which had now been on board of the praam for five\ndays.  The several pieces of this machine, having been conveyed along the\nrailways upon the waggons to a position immediately under the bridge,\nwere elevated to its level, or thirty feet above the rock, in the\nfollowing manner.  A chain-tackle was suspended over a pulley from the\ncross-beam connecting the tops of the kingposts of the bridge, which was\nworked by a winch-machine with wheel, pinion, and barrel, round which\nlast the chain was wound.  This apparatus was placed on the beacon side\nof the bridge, at the distance of about twelve feet from the cross-beam\nand pulley in the middle of the bridge.  Immediately under the cross-beam\na hatch was formed in the roadway of the bridge, measuring seven feet in\nlength and five feet in breadth, made to shut with folding boards like a\ndouble door, through which stones and other articles were raised; the\nfolding doors were then let down, and the stone or load was gently\nlowered upon a waggon which was wheeled on railway trucks towards the\nlighthouse.  In this manner the several castings of the balance-crane\nwere got up to the top of the solid of the building.\n\nThe several apartments of the beacon-house having been cleaned out and\nsupplied with bedding, a sufficient stock of provisions was put into the\nstore, when Peter Fortune, formerly noticed, lighted his fire in the\nbeacon for the first time this season.  Sixteen artificers at the same\ntime mounted to their barrack-room, and all the foremen of the works also\ntook possession of their cabin, all heartily rejoiced at getting rid of\nthe trouble of boating and the sickly motion of the tender.\n\n                                                      [Saturday, 12th May]\n\nThe wind was at E.N.E., blowing so fresh, and accompanied with so much\nsea, that no stones could be landed to-day.  The people on the rock,\nhowever, were busily employed in screwing together the balance-crane,\ncutting out the joggle-holes in the upper course, and preparing all\nthings for commencing the building operations.\n\n                                                        [Sunday, 13th May]\n\nThe weather still continues boisterous, although the barometer has all\nthe while stood at about 30 inches.  Towards evening the wind blew so\nfresh at E. by S. that the boats both of the _Smeaton_ and tender were\nobliged to be hoisted in, and it was feared that the _Smeaton_ would have\nto slip her moorings.  The people on the rock were seen busily employed,\nand had the balance-crane apparently ready for use, but no communication\ncould be had with them to-day.\n\n                                                        [Monday, 14th May]\n\nThe wind continued to blow so fresh, and the _Smeaton_ rode so heavily\nwith her cargo, that at noon a signal was made for her getting under\nweigh, when she stood towards Arbroath; and on board of the tender we are\nstill without any communication with the people on the rock, where the\nsea was seen breaking over the top of the building in great sprays, and\nraging with much agitation among the beams of the beacon.\n\n                                                      [Thursday, 17th May]\n\nThe wind, in the course of the day, had shifted from north to west; the\nsea being also considerably less, a boat landed on the rock at six p.m.,\nfor the first time since the 11th, with the provisions and water brought\noff by the _Patriot_.  The inhabitants of the beacon were all well, but\ntired above measure for want of employment, as the balance-crane and\napparatus was all in readiness.  Under these circumstances they felt no\nless desirous of the return of good weather than those afloat, who were\ncontinually tossed with the agitation of the sea.  The writer, in\nparticular, felt himself almost as much fatigued and worn-out as he had\nbeen at any period since the commencement of the work.  The very backward\nstate of the weather at so advanced a period of the season unavoidably\ncreated some alarm, lest he should be overtaken with bad weather at a\nlate period of the season, with the building operations in an unfinished\nstate.  These apprehensions were, no doubt, rather increased by the\ninconveniences of his situation afloat, as the tender rolled and pitched\nexcessively at times.  This being also his first off-set for the season,\nevery bone of his body felt sore with preserving a sitting posture while\nhe endeavoured to pass away the time in reading; as for writing, it was\nwholly impracticable.  He had several times entertained thoughts of\nleaving the station for a few days and going into Arbroath with the\ntender till the weather should improve; but as the artificers had been\nlanded on the rock he was averse to this at the commencement of the\nseason, knowing also that he would be equally uneasy in every situation\ntill the first cargo was landed: and he therefore resolved to continue at\nhis post until this should be effected.\n\n                                                        [Friday, 18th May]\n\nThe wind being now N.W., the sea was considerably run down, and this\nmorning at five o’clock the landing-master’s crew, thirteen in number,\nleft the tender; and having now no detention with the landing of\nartificers, they proceeded to unmoor the _Hedderwick_ praam-boat, and\ntowed her alongside of the _Smeaton_: and in the course of the day\ntwenty-three blocks of stone, three casks of pozzolano, three of sand,\nthree of lime, and one of Roman cement, together with three bundles of\ntrenails and three of wedges, were all landed on the rock and raised the\ntop of the building by means of the tackle suspended from the cross-beam\non the middle of the bridge.  The stones were then moved along the bridge\non the waggon to the building within reach of the balance-crane, with\nwhich they were laid in their respective places on the building.  The\nmasons immediately thereafter proceeded to bore the trenail-holes into\nthe course below, and otherwise to complete the one in hand.  When the\nfirst stone was to be suspended by the balance-crane, the bell on the\nbeacon was rung, and all the artificers and seamen were collected on the\nbuilding.  Three hearty cheers were given while it was lowered into its\nplace, and the steward served round a glass of rum, when success was\ndrunk to the further progress of the building.\n\n                                                        [Sunday, 20th May]\n\nThe wind was southerly to-day, but there was much less sea than\nyesterday, and the landing-master’s crew were enabled to discharge and\nland twenty-three pieces of stone and other articles for the work.  The\nartificers had completed the laying of the twenty-seventh or first course\nof the staircase this morning, and in the evening they finished the\nboring, trenailing, wedging, and grouting it with mortar.  At twelve\no’clock noon the beacon-house bell was rung, and all hands were collected\non the top of the building, where prayers were read for the first time on\nthe lighthouse, which forcibly struck every one, and had, upon the whole,\na very impressive effect.\n\nFrom the hazardous situation of the beacon-house with regard to fire,\nbeing composed wholly of timber, there was no small risk from accident:\nand on this account one of the most steady of the artificers was\nappointed to see that the fire of the cooking-house, and the lights in\ngeneral, were carefully extinguished at stated hours.\n\n                                                        [Monday, 4th June]\n\nThis being the birthday of our much-revered Sovereign King George III,\nnow in the fiftieth year of his reign, the shipping of the Lighthouse\nservice were this morning decorated with colours according to the taste\nof their respective captains.  Flags were also hoisted upon the\nbeacon-house and balance-crane on the top of the building.  At twelve\nnoon a salute was fired from the tender, when the King’s health was\ndrunk, with all the honours, both on the rock and on board of the\nshipping.\n\n                                                       [Tuesday, 5th June]\n\nAs the lighthouse advanced in height, the cubical contents of the stones\nwere less, but they had to be raised to a greater height; and the walls,\nbeing thinner, were less commodious for the necessary machinery and the\nartificers employed, which considerably retarded the work.  Inconvenience\nwas also occasionally experienced from the men dropping their coats,\nhats, mallets, and other tools, at high-water, which were carried away by\nthe tide; and the danger to the people themselves was now greatly\nincreased.  Had any of them fallen from the beacon or building at\nhigh-water, while the landing-master’s crew were generally engaged with\nthe craft at a distance, it must have rendered the accident doubly\npainful to those on the rock, who at this time had no boat, and\nconsequently no means of rendering immediate and prompt assistance.  In\nsuch cases it would have been too late to have got a boat by signal from\nthe tender.  A small boat, which could be lowered at pleasure, was\ntherefore suspended by a pair of davits projected from the cook-house,\nthe keel being about thirty feet from the rock.  This boat, with its\ntackle was put under the charge of James Glen, of whose exertions on the\nbeacon mention has already been made, and who, having in early life been\na seaman, was also very expert in the management of a boat.  A life-buoy\nwas likewise suspended from the bridge, to which a coil of line two\nhundred fathoms in length was attached, which could be let out to a\nperson falling into the water, or to the people in the boat, should they\nnot be able to work her with the oars.\n\n                                                       [Tuesday, 7th June]\n\nTo-day twelve stones were landed on the rock, being the remainder of the\n_Patriot’s_ cargo; and the artificers built the thirty-ninth course,\nconsisting of fourteen stones.  The Bell Rock works had now a very busy\nappearance, as the lighthouse was daily getting more into form.  Besides\nthe artificers and their cook, the writer and his servant were also\nlodged on the beacon, counting in all twenty-nine; and at low-water the\nlanding-master’s crew, consisting of from twelve to fifteen seamen, were\nemployed in transporting the building materials, working the landing\napparatus on the rock, and dragging the stone waggons along the railways.\n\n                                                        [Friday, 8th June]\n\nIn the course of this day the weather varied much.  In the morning it was\ncalm, in the middle part of the day there were light airs of wind from\nthe south, and in the evening fresh breezes from the east.  The barometer\nin the writer’s cabin in the beacon-house oscillated from 30 inches to\n30.42, and the weather was extremely pleasant.  This, in any situation,\nforms one of the chief comforts of life; but, as may easily be conceived,\nit was doubly so to people stuck, as it were, upon a pinnacle in the\nmiddle of the ocean.\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 10th June]\n\nOne of the praam-boats had been brought to the rock with eleven stones,\nnotwithstanding the perplexity which attended the getting of those\nformerly landed taken up to the building.  Mr. Peter Logan, the foreman\nbuilder, interposed, and prevented this cargo from being delivered; but\nthe landing-master’s crew were exceedingly averse to this arrangement,\nfrom an idea that “ill luck” would in future attend the praam, her cargo,\nand those who navigated her, from thus reversing her voyage.  It may be\nnoticed that this was the first instance of a praam-boat having been sent\nfrom the Bell Rock with any part of her cargo on board, and was\nconsidered so uncommon an occurrence that it became a topic of\nconversation among the seamen and artificers.\n\n                                                      [Tuesday, 12th June]\n\nTo-day the stones formerly sent from the rock were safely landed,\nnotwithstanding the augury of the seamen in consequence of their being\nsent away two days before.\n\n                                                     [Thursday, 14th June]\n\nTo-day twenty-seven stones and eleven joggle-pieces were landed, part of\nwhich consisted of the forty-seventh course, forming the storeroom floor.\nThe builders were at work this morning by four o’clock, in the hopes of\nbeing able to accomplish the laying of the eighteen stones of this\ncourse.  But at eight o’clock in the evening they had still two to lay,\nand as the stones of this course were very unwieldy, being six feet in\nlength, they required much precaution and care both in lifting and laying\nthem.  It was only on the writer’s suggestion to Mr. Logan that the\nartificers were induced to leave off, as they had intended to complete\nthis floor before going to bed.  The two remaining stones were, however,\nlaid in their places without mortar when the bell on the beacon was rung,\nand, all hands being collected on the top of the building, three hearty\ncheers were given on covering the first apartment.  The steward then\nserved out a dram to each, when the whole retired to their barrack much\nfatigued, but with the anticipation of the most perfect repose even in\nthe “hurricane-house,” amidst the dashing seas on the Bell Rock.\n\nWhile the workmen were at breakfast and dinner it was the writer’s usual\npractice to spend his time on the walls of the building, which,\nnotwithstanding the narrowness of the track, nevertheless formed his\nprincipal walk when the rock was under water.  But this afternoon he had\nhis writing-desk set upon the storeroom floor, when he wrote to Mrs.\nStevenson—certainly the first letter dated from the Bell Rock\n_Lighthouse_—giving a detail of the fortunate progress of the work with\nan assurance that the lighthouse would soon be completed at the rate at\nwhich it now proceeded; and, the _Patriot_ having sailed for Arbroath in\nthe evening, he felt no small degree of pleasure in despatching this\ncommunication to his family.\n\nThe weather still continuing favourable for the operations at the rock,\nthe work proceeded with much energy, through the exertions both of the\nseamen and artificers.  For the more speedy and effectual working of the\nseveral tackles in raising the materials as the building advanced in\nheight, and there being a great extent of railway to attend to, which\nrequired constant repairs, two additional millwrights were added to the\ncomplement on the rock, which, including the writer, now counted\nthirty-one in all.  So crowded was the men’s barrack that the beds were\nranged five tier in height, allowing only about one foot eight inches for\neach bed.  The artificers commenced this morning at five o’clock, and, in\nthe course of the day, they laid the forty-eighth and forty-ninth\ncourses, consisting each of sixteen blocks.  From the favourable state of\nthe weather, and the regular manner in which the work now proceeded, the\nartificers had generally from four to seven extra hours’ work, which,\nincluding their stated wages of 3s. 4d., yielded them from 5s. 4d. to\nabout 6s. 10d. per day besides their board; even the postage of their\nletters was paid while they were at the Bell Rock.  In these advantages\nthe foremen also shared, having about double the pay and amount of\npremiums of the artificers.  The seamen being less out of their element\nin the Bell Rock operations than the landsmen, their premiums consisted\nin a slump sum payable at the end of the season, which extended from\nthree to ten guineas.\n\nAs the laying of the floors was somewhat tedious, the landing-master and\nhis crew had got considerably beforehand with the building artificers in\nbringing materials faster to the rock than they could be built.  The\nseamen having, therefore, some spare time, were occasionally employed\nduring fine weather in dredging or grappling for the several mushroom\nanchors and mooring-chains which had been lost in the vicinity of the\nBell Rock during the progress of the work by the breaking loose and\ndrifting of the floating buoys.  To encourage their exertions in this\nsearch, five guineas were offered as a premium for each set they should\nfind; and, after much patient application, they succeeded to-day in\nhooking one of these lost anchors with its chain.\n\nIt was a general remark at the Bell Rock, as before noticed, that fish\nwere never plenty in its neighbourhood excepting in good weather.\nIndeed, the seamen used to speculate about the state of the weather from\ntheir success in fishing.  When the fish disappeared at the rock, it was\nconsidered a sure indication that a gale was not far off, as the fish\nseemed to seek shelter in deeper water from the roughness of the sea\nduring these changes in the weather.  At this time the rock, at\nhigh-water, was completely covered with podlies, or the fry of the\ncoal-fish, about six or eight inches in length.  The artificers sometimes\noccupied half an hour after breakfast and dinner in catching these little\nfishes, but were more frequently supplied from the boats of the tender.\n\n                                                     [Saturday, 16th June]\n\nThe landing-master having this day discharged the _Smeaton_ and loaded\nthe _Hedderwick and Dickie_ praam-boats with nineteen stones, they were\ntowed to their respective moorings, when Captain Wilson, in consequence\nof the heavy swell of sea, came in his boat to the beacon-house to\nconsult with the writer as to the propriety of venturing the loaded\npraam-boats with their cargoes to the rock while so much sea was running.\nAfter some dubiety expressed on the subject, in which the ardent mind of\nthe landing-master suggested many arguments in favour of his being able\nto convey the praams in perfect safety, it was acceded to.  In bad\nweather, and especially on occasions of difficulty like the present, Mr.\nWilson, who was an extremely active seaman, measuring about five feet\nthree inches in height, of a robust habit, generally dressed himself in\nwhat he called a _monkey jacket_, made of thick duffle cloth, with a pair\nof Dutchman’s petticoat trousers, reaching only to his knees, where they\nwere met with a pair of long water-tight boots; with this dress, his\nglazed hat, and his small brass speaking trumpet in his hand, he bade\ndefiance to the weather.  When he made his appearance in this most\nsuitable attire for the service his crew seemed to possess additional\nlife, never failing to use their utmost exertions when the captain put on\nhis _storm rigging_.  They had this morning commenced loading the\npraam-boats at four o’clock, and proceeded to tow them into the eastern\nlanding-place, which was accomplished with much dexterity, though not\nwithout the risk of being thrown, by the force of the sea, on certain\nprojecting ledges of the rock.  In such a case the loss even of a single\nstone would have greatly retarded the work.  For the greater safety in\nentering the creek it was necessary to put out several warps and\nguy-ropes to guide the boats into its narrow and intricate entrance; and\nit frequently happened that the sea made a clean breach over the praams,\nwhich not only washed their decks, but completely drenched the crew in\nwater.\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 17th June]\n\nIt was fortunate, in the present state of the weather, that the fiftieth\ncourse was in a sheltered spot, within the reach of the tackle of the\nwinch-machine upon the bridge; a few stones were stowed upon the bridge\nitself, and the remainder upon the building, which kept the artificers at\nwork.  The stowing of the materials upon the rock was the department of\nAlexander Brebner, mason, who spared no pains in attending to the safety\nof the stones, and who, in the present state of the work, when the stones\nwere landed faster than could be built, generally worked till the water\nrose to his middle.  At one o’clock to-day the bell rung for prayers, and\nall hands were collected into the upper barrack-room of the beacon-house,\nwhen the usual service was performed.\n\nThe wind blew very hard in the course of last night from N.E., and to-day\nthe sea ran so high that no boat could approach the rock.  During the\ndinner-hour, when the writer was going to the top of the building as\nusual, but just as he had entered the door and was about to ascend the\nladder, a great noise was heard overhead, and in an instant he was soused\nin water from a sea which had most unexpectedly come over the walls,\nthough now about fifty-eight feet in height.  On making his retreat he\nfound himself completely whitened by the lime, which had mixed with the\nwater while dashing down through the different floors; and, as nearly as\nhe could guess, a quantity equal to about a hogshead had come over the\nwalls, and now streamed out at the door.  After having shifted himself,\nhe again sat down in his cabin, the sea continuing to run so high that\nthe builders did not resume their operations on the walls this afternoon.\nThe incident just noticed did not create more surprise in the mind of the\nwriter than the sublime appearance of the waves as they rolled\nmajestically over the rock.  This scene he greatly enjoyed while sitting\nat his cabin window; each wave approached the beacon like a vast scroll\nunfolding; and in passing discharged a quantity of air, which he not only\ndistinctly felt, but was even sufficient to lift the leaves of a book\nwhich lay before him.  These waves might be ten or twelve feet in height,\nand about 250 feet in length, their smaller end being towards the north,\nwhere the water was deep, and they were opened or cut through by the\ninterposition of the building and beacon.  The gradual manner in which\nthe sea, upon these occasions, is observed to become calm or to subside,\nis a very remarkable feature of this phenomenon.  For example, when a\ngale is succeeded by a calm, every third or fourth wave forms one of\nthese great seas, which occur in spaces of from three to five minutes, as\nnoted by the writer’s watch; but in the course of the next tide they\nbecome less frequent, and take off so as to occur only in ten or fifteen\nminutes; and, singular enough, at the third tide after such gales, the\nwriter has remarked that only one or two of these great waves appear in\nthe course of the whole tide.\n\n                                                      [Tuesday, 19th June]\n\nThe 19th was a very unpleasant and disagreeable day, both for the seamen\nand artificers, as it rained throughout with little intermission from\nfour a.m. till eleven p.m., accompanied with thunder and lightning,\nduring which period the work nevertheless continued unremittingly, and\nthe builders laid the fifty-first and fifty-second courses.  This state\nof weather was no less severe upon the mortar-makers, who required to\ntemper or prepare the mortar of a thicker or thinner consistency, in some\nmeasure, according to the state of the weather.  From the elevated\nposition of the building, the mortar gallery on the beacon was now much\nlower, and the lime-buckets were made to traverse upon a rope distended\nbetween it and the building.  On occasions like the present, however,\nthere was often a difference of opinion between the builders and the\nmortar-makers.  John Watt, who had the principal charge of the mortar,\nwas a most active worker, but, being somewhat of an irascible temper, the\nbuilders occasionally amused themselves at his expense; for while he was\neagerly at work with his large iron-shod pestle in the mortar-tub, they\noften sent down contradictory orders, some crying, ‘Make it a little\nstiffer, or thicker, John,’ while others called out to make it ‘thinner,’\nto which he generally returned very speedy and sharp replies, so that\nthese conversations at times were rather amusing.\n\nDuring wet weather the situation of the artificers on the top of the\nbuilding was extremely disagreeable; for although their work did not\nrequire great exertion, yet, as each man had his particular part to\nperform, either in working the crane or in laying the stones, it required\nthe closest application and attention, not only on the part of Mr. Peter\nLogan, the foreman, who was constantly on the walls, but also of the\nchief workmen.  Robert Selkirk, the principal builder, for example, had\nevery stone to lay in its place.  David Cumming, a mason, had the charge\nof working the tackle of the balance-weight, and James Scott, also a\nmason, took charge of the purchase with which the stones were laid; while\nthe pointing the joints of the walls with cement was intrusted to William\nReid and William Kennedy, who stood upon a scaffold suspended over the\nwalls in rather a frightful manner.  The least act of carelessness or\ninattention on the part of any of these men might have been fatal, not\nonly to themselves, but also to the surrounding workmen, especially if\nany accident had happened to the crane itself, while the material damage\nor loss of a single stone would have put an entire stop to the operations\nuntil another could have been brought from Arbroath.  The artificers,\nhaving wrought seven and a half hours of extra time to-day, had 3s. 9d.\nof extra pay, while the foremen had 7s. 6d. over and above their stated\npay and board.  Although, therefore, the work was both hazardous and\nfatiguing, yet, the encouragement being considerable, they were always\nvery cheerful, and perfectly reconciled to the confinement and other\ndisadvantages of the place.\n\nDuring fine weather, and while the nights were short, the duty on board\nof the floating light was literally nothing but a waiting on, and\ntherefore one of her boats, with a crew of five men, daily attended the\nrock, but always returned to the vessel at night.  The carpenter,\nhowever, was one of those who was left on board of the ship, as he also\nacted in the capacity of assistant lightkeeper, being, besides, a person\nwho was apt to feel discontent and to be averse to changing his quarters,\nespecially to work with the millwrights and joiners at the rock, who\noften, for hours together, wrought knee-deep, and not unfrequently up to\nthe middle, in water.  Mr. Watt having about this time made a requisition\nfor another hand, the carpenter was ordered to attend the rock in the\nfloating light’s boat.  This he did with great reluctance, and found so\nmuch fault that he soon got into discredit with his messmates.  On this\noccasion he left the Lighthouse service, and went as a sailor in a vessel\nbound for America—a step which, it is believed, he soon regretted, as, in\nthe course of things, he would, in all probability, have accompanied Mr.\nJohn Reid, the principal lightkeeper of the floating light, to the Bell\nRock Lighthouse as his principal assistant.  The writer had a wish to be\nof service to this man, as he was one of those who came off to the\nfloating light in the month of September 1807, while she was riding at\nsingle anchor after the severe gale of the 7th, at a time when it was\nhardly possible to make up this vessel’s crew; but the crossness of his\nmanner prevented his reaping the benefit of such intentions.\n\n                                                       [Friday, 22nd June]\n\nThe building operations had for some time proceeded more slowly, from the\nhigher parts of the lighthouse requiring much longer time than an equal\ntonnage of the lower courses.  The duty of the landing-master’s crew had,\nupon the whole, been easy of late; for though the work was occasionally\nirregular, yet the stones being lighter, they were more speedily lifted\nfrom the hold of the stone vessel to the deck of the praam-boat, and\nagain to the waggons on the railway, after which they came properly under\nthe charge of the foreman builder.  It is, however, a strange, though not\nan uncommon, feature in the human character, that, when people have least\nto complain of, they are most apt to become dissatisfied, as was now the\ncase with the seamen employed in the Bell Rock service about their\nrations of beer.  Indeed, ever since the carpenter of the floating light,\nformerly noticed, had been brought to the rock, expressions of discontent\nhad been manifested upon various occasions.  This being represented to\nthe writer, he sent for Captain Wilson, the landing-master, and Mr.\nTaylor, commander of the tender, with whom he talked over the subject.\nThey stated that they considered the daily allowance of the seamen in\nevery respect ample, and that, the work being now much lighter than\nformerly, they had no just ground for complaint; Mr. Taylor adding that,\nif those who now complained ‘were even to be fed upon soft bread and\nturkeys, they would not think themselves right.’  At twelve noon the work\nof the landing-master’s crew was completed for the day; but at four\no’clock, while the rock was under water, those on the beacon were\nsurprised by the arrival of a boat from the tender without any signal\nhaving been made from the beacon.  It brought the following note to the\nwriter from the landing-master’s crew:—\n\n                                               ‘_Sir Joseph Banks Tender_.\n\n    ‘SIR,—We are informed by our masters that our allowance is to be as\n    before, and it is not sufficient to serve us, for we have been at\n    work since four o’clock this morning, and we have come on board to\n    dinner, and there is no beer for us before to-morrow morning, to\n    which a sufficient answer is required before we go from the beacon;\n    and we are, Sir, your most obedient servants.’\n\nOn reading this, the writer returned a verbal message, intimating that an\nanswer would be sent on board of the tender, at the same time ordering\nthe boat instantly to quit the beacon.  He then addressed the following\nnote to the landing-master:—\n\n                                      ‘_Beacon-house_, 22_nd_ _June_ 1810,\n                                                       _Five o’clock p.m_.\n\n    ‘SIR,—I have just now received a letter purporting to be from the\n    landing-master’s crew and seamen on board of the _Sir Joseph Banks_,\n    though without either date or signature; in answer to which I enclose\n    a statement of the daily allowance of provisions for the seamen in\n    this service, which you will post up in the ship’s galley, and at\n    seven o’clock this evening I will come on board to inquire into this\n    unexpected and most unnecessary demand for an additional allowance of\n    beer.  In the enclosed you will not find any alteration from the\n    original statement, fixed in the galley at the beginning of the\n    season.  I have, however, judged this mode of giving your people an\n    answer preferable to that of conversing with them on the beacon. —I\n    am, Sir, your most obedient servant,\n\n                                                         ROBERT STEVENSON.\n\n    ‘To CAPTAIN WILSON.’\n\n    ‘_Beacon House_, 22_nd_ _June_ 1810.—Schedule of the daily allowance\n    of provisions to be served out on board of the _Sir Joseph Banks_\n    tender: “1½ lb. beef; 1 lb. bread; 8 oz. oatmeal; 2 oz. barley; 2 oz.\n    butter; 3 quarts beer; vegetables and salt no stated allowance.  When\n    the seamen are employed in unloading the _Smeaton_ and _Patriot_, a\n    draught of beer is, as formerly, to be allowed from the stock of\n    these vessels.  Further, in wet and stormy weather, or when the work\n    commences very early in the morning, or continues till a late hour at\n    night, a glass of spirits will also be served out to the crew as\n    heretofore, on the requisition of the landing-master.”\n\n                                                        ROBERT STEVENSON.’\n\nOn writing this letter and schedule, a signal was made on the beacon for\nthe landing-master’s boat, which immediately came to the rock, and the\nschedule was afterwards stuck up in the tender’s galley.  When sufficient\ntime had been allowed to the crew to consider of their conduct, a second\nsignal was made for a boat, and at seven o’clock the writer left the Bell\nRock, after a residence of four successive weeks in the beacon-house.\nThe first thing which occupied his attention on board of the tender was\nto look round upon the lighthouse, which he saw, with some degree of\nemotion and surprise, now vying in height with the beacon-house; for\nalthough he had often viewed it from the extremity of the western railway\non the rock, yet the scene, upon the whole, seemed far more interesting\nfrom the tender’s moorings at the distance of about half a mile.\n\nThe _Smeaton_ having just arrived at her moorings with a cargo, a signal\nwas made for Captain Pool to come on board of the tender, that he might\nbe at hand to remove from the service any of those who might persist in\ntheir discontented conduct.  One of the two principal leaders in this\naffair, the master of one of the praam-boats, who had also steered the\nboat which brought the letter to the beacon, was first called upon deck,\nand asked if he had read the statement fixed up in the galley this\nafternoon, and whether he was satisfied with it.  He replied that he had\nread the paper, but was not satisfied, as it held out no alteration in\nthe allowance, on which he was immediately ordered into the _Smeaton’s_\nboat.  The next man called had but lately entered the service, and, being\nalso interrogated as to his resolution, he declared himself to be of the\nsame mind with the praam-master, and was also forthwith ordered into the\nboat.  The writer, without calling any more of the seamen, went forward\nto the gangway, where they were collected and listening to what was\npassing upon deck.  He addressed them at the hatchway, and stated that\ntwo of their companions had just been dismissed the service and sent on\nboard of the _Smeaton_ to be conveyed to Arbroath.  He therefore wished\neach man to consider for himself how far it would be proper, by any\nunreasonableness of conduct, to place themselves in a similar situation,\nespecially as they were aware that it was optional in him either to\ndismiss them or send them on board a man-of-war.  It might appear that\nmuch inconveniency would be felt at the rock by a change of hands at this\ncritical period, by checking for a time the progress of a building so\nintimately connected with the best interests of navigation; yet this\nwould be but of a temporary nature, while the injury to themselves might\nbe irreparable.  It was now therefore, required of any man who, in this\ndisgraceful manner, chose to leave the service, that he should instantly\nmake his appearance on deck while the _Smeaton’s_ boat was alongside.\nBut those below having expressed themselves satisfied with their\nsituation-viz., William Brown, George Gibb, Alexander Scott, John Dick,\nRobert Couper, Alexander Shephard, James Grieve, David Carey, William\nPearson, Stuart Eaton, Alexander Lawrence, and John Spink—were\naccordingly considered as having returned to their duty.  This\ndisposition to mutiny, which had so strongly manifested itself, being now\nhappily suppressed, Captain Pool got orders to proceed for Arbroath Bay,\nand land the two men he had on board, and to deliver the following letter\nat the office of the workyard:—\n\n                              ‘_On board of the Tender off the Bell Rock_,\n                                  22_nd_ _June_ 1810, _eight o’clock p.m._\n\n    ‘DEAR SIR,—A discontented and mutinous spirit having manifested\n    itself of late among the landing-master’s crew, they struck work\n    to-day and demanded an additional allowance of beer, and I have found\n    it necessary to dismiss D---d and M---e, who are now sent on shore\n    with the _Smeaton_.  You will therefore be so good as to pay them\n    their wages, including this day only.  Nothing can be more\n    unreasonable than the conduct of the seamen on this occasion, as the\n    landing-master’s crew not only had their allowance on board of the\n    tender, but, in the course of this day, they had drawn no fewer than\n    twenty-four quart pots of beer from the stock of the _Patriot_ while\n    unloading her. —I remain, yours truly,\n\n                                                         ROBERT STEVENSON.\n\n    ‘To Mr. LACHLAN KENNEDY,\n          Bell Rock Office, Arbroath.’\n\nOn despatching this letter to Mr. Kennedy, the writer returned to the\nbeacon about nine o’clock, where this afternoon’s business had produced\nmany conjectures, especially when the _Smeaton_ got under weigh, instead\nof proceeding to land her cargo.  The bell on the beacon being rung, the\nartificers were assembled on the bridge, when the affair was explained to\nthem.  He, at the same time, congratulated them upon the first appearance\nof mutiny being happily set at rest by the dismissal of its two principal\nabettors.\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 24th June]\n\nAt the rock the landing of the materials and the building operations of\nthe light-room store went on successfully, and in a way similar to those\nof the provision store.  To-day it blew fresh breezes; but the seamen\nnevertheless landed twenty-eight stones, and the artificers built the\nfifty-eighth and fifty-ninth courses.  The works were visited by Mr.\nMurdoch, junior, from Messrs. Boulton and Watt’s works of Soho.  He\nlanded just as the bell rung for prayers, after which the writer enjoyed\nmuch pleasure from his very intelligent conversation; and, having been\nalmost the only stranger he had seen for some weeks, he parted with him,\nafter a short interview, with much regret.\n\n                                                     [Thursday, 28th June]\n\nLast night the wind had shifted to north-east, and, blowing fresh, was\naccompanied with a heavy surf upon the rock.  Towards high-water it had a\nvery grand and wonderful appearance.  Waves of considerable magnitude\nrose as high as the solid or level of the entrance-door, which, being\nopen to the south-west, was fortunately to the leeward; but on the\nwindward side the sprays flew like lightning up the sloping sides of the\nbuilding; and although the walls were now elevated sixty-four feet above\nthe rock, and about fifty-two feet from high-water mark, yet the\nartificers were nevertheless wetted, and occasionally interrupted, in\ntheir operations on the top of the walls.  These appearances were, in a\ngreat measure, new at the Bell Rock, there having till of late been no\nbuilding to conduct the seas, or object to compare with them.  Although,\nfrom the description of the Eddystone Lighthouse, the mind was prepared\nfor such effects, yet they were not expected to the present extent in the\nsummer season; the sea being most awful to-day, whether observed from the\nbeacon or the building.  To windward, the sprays fell from the height\nabove noticed in the most wonderful cascades, and streamed down the walls\nof the building in froth as white as snow.  To leeward of the lighthouse\nthe collision or meeting of the waves produced a pure white kind of\n_drift_; it rose about thirty feet in height, like a fine downy mist,\nwhich, in its fall, fell upon the face and hands more like a dry powder\nthan a liquid substance.  The effect of these seas, as they raged among\nthe beams and dashed upon the higher parts of the beacon, produced a\ntemporary tremulous motion throughout the whole fabric, which to a\nstranger must have been frightful.\n\n                                                        [Sunday, 1st July]\n\nThe writer had now been at the Bell Rock since the latter end of May, or\nabout six weeks, during four of which he had been a constant inhabitant\nof the beacon without having been once off the rock.  After witnessing\nthe laying of the sixty-seventh or second course of the bedroom\napartment, he left the rock with the tender and went ashore, as some\narrangements were to be made for the future conduct of the works at\nArbroath, which were soon to be brought to a close; the landing-master’s\ncrew having, in the meantime, shifted on board of the _Patriot_.  In\nleaving the rock, the writer kept his eyes fixed upon the lighthouse,\nwhich had recently got into the form of a house, having several tiers or\nstories of windows.  Nor was he unmindful of his habitation in the\nbeacon—now far overtopped by the masonry,—where he had spent several\nweeks in a kind of active retirement, making practical experiment of the\nfewness of the positive wants of man.  His cabin measured not more than\nfour feet three inches in breadth on the floor; and though, from the\noblique direction of the beams of the beacon, it widened towards the top,\nyet it did not admit of the full extension of his arms when he stood on\nthe floor; while its length was little more than sufficient for\nsuspending a cot-bed during the night, calculated for being triced up to\nthe roof through the day, which left free room for the admission of\noccasional visitants.  His folding table was attached with hinges,\nimmediately under the small window of the apartment, and his books,\nbarometer, thermometer, portmanteau, and two or three camp-stools, formed\nthe bulk of his movables.  His diet being plain, the paraphernalia of the\ntable were proportionally simple; though everything had the appearance of\ncomfort, and even of neatness, the walls being covered with green cloth\nformed into panels with red tape, and his bed festooned with curtains of\nyellow cotton-stuff.  If, in speculating upon the abstract wants of man\nin such a state of exclusion, one were reduced to a single book, the\nSacred Volume—whether considered for the striking diversity of its story,\nthe morality of its doctrine, or the important truths of its gospel—would\nhave proved by far the greatest treasure.\n\n                                                        [Monday, 2nd July]\n\nIn walking over the workyard at Arbroath this morning, the writer found\nthat the stones of the course immediately under the cornice were all in\nhand, and that a week’s work would now finish the whole, while the\nintermediate courses lay ready numbered and marked for shipping to the\nrock.  Among other subjects which had occupied his attention to-day was a\nvisit from some of the relations of George Dall, a young man who had been\nimpressed near Dundee in the month of February last; a dispute had arisen\nbetween the magistrates of that burgh and the Regulating Officer as to\nhis right of impressing Dall, who was _bonâ fide_ one of the protected\nseamen in the Bell Rock service.  In the meantime, the poor lad was\ndetained, and ultimately committed to the prison of Dundee, to remain\nuntil the question should be tried before the Court of Session.  His\nfriends were naturally very desirous to have him relieved upon bail.\nBut, as this was only to be done by the judgment of the Court, all that\ncould be said was that his pay and allowances should be continued in the\nsame manner as if he had been upon the sick-list.  The circumstances of\nDall’s case were briefly these:—He had gone to see some of his friends in\nthe neighbourhood of Dundee, in winter, while the works were suspended,\nhaving got leave of absence from Mr. Taylor, who commanded the Bell Rock\ntender, and had in his possession one of the Protection Medals.\nUnfortunately, however, for Dall, the Regulating Officer thought proper\nto disregard these documents, as, according to the strict and literal\ninterpretation of the Admiralty regulations, a seaman does not stand\nprotected unless he is actually on board of his ship, or in a boat\nbelonging to her, or has the Admiralty protection in his possession.\nThis order of the Board, however, cannot be rigidly followed in practice;\nand therefore, when the matter is satisfactorily stated to the Regulating\nOfficer, the impressed man is generally liberated.  But in Dall’s case\nthis was peremptorily refused, and he was retained at the instance of the\nmagistrates.  The writer having brought the matter under the\nconsideration of the Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouses, they\nauthorised it to be tried on the part of the Lighthouse Board, as one of\nextreme hardship.  The Court, upon the first hearing, ordered Dall to be\nliberated from prison; and the proceedings never went further.\n\n                                                     [Wednesday, 4th July]\n\nBeing now within twelve courses of being ready for building the cornice,\nmeasures were taken for getting the stones of it and the parapet-wall of\nthe light-room brought from Edinburgh, where, as before noticed, they had\nbeen prepared and were in readiness for shipping.  The honour of\nconveying the upper part of the lighthouse, and of landing the last stone\nof the building on the rock, was considered to belong to Captain Pool of\nthe _Smeaton_, who had been longer in the service than the master of the\n_Patriot_.  The _Smeaton_ was, therefore, now partly loaded with old\niron, consisting of broken railways and other lumber which had been lying\nabout the rock.  After landing these at Arbroath, she took on board James\nCraw, with his horse and cart, which could now be spared at the workyard,\nto be employed in carting the stones from Edinburgh to Leith.  Alexander\nDavidson and William Kennedy, two careful masons, were also sent to take\ncharge of the loading of the stones at Greenside, and stowing them on\nboard of the vessel at Leith.  The writer also went on board, with a view\nto call at the Bell Rock and to take his passage up the Firth of Forth.\nThe wind, however, coming to blow very fresh from the eastward, with\nthick and foggy weather, it became necessary to reef the mainsail and set\nthe second jib.  When in the act of making a tack towards the tender, the\nsailors who worked the head-sheets were, all of a sudden, alarmed with\nthe sound of the smith’s hammer and anvil on the beacon, and had just\ntime to put the ship about to save her from running ashore on the\nnorthwestern point of the rock, marked ‘James Craw’s Horse.’  On looking\ntowards the direction from whence the sound came, the building and\nbeacon-house were seen, with consternation, while the ship was hailed by\nthose on the rock, who were no less confounded at seeing the near\napproach of the _Smeaton_; and, just as the vessel cleared the danger,\nthe smith and those in the mortar gallery made signs in token of their\nhappiness at our fortunate escape.  From this occurrence the writer had\nan experimental proof of the utility of the large bells which were in\npreparation to be rung by the machinery of the revolving light; for, had\nit not been the sound of the smith’s anvil, the _Smeaton_, in all\nprobability, would have been wrecked upon the rock.  In case the vessel\nhad struck, those on board might have been safe, having now the\nbeacon-house, as a place of refuge; but the vessel, which was going at a\ngreat velocity, must have suffered severely, and it was more than\nprobable that the horse would have been drowned, there being no means of\ngetting him out of the vessel.  Of this valuable animal and his master we\nshall take an opportunity of saying more in another place.\n\n                                                      [Thursday, 5th July]\n\nThe weather cleared up in the course of the night, but the wind shifted\nto the N.E. and blew very fresh.  From the force of the wind, being now\nthe period of spring-tides, a very heavy swell was experienced at the\nrock.  At two o’clock on the following morning the people on the beacon\nwere in a state of great alarm about their safety, as the sea had broke\nup part of the floor of the mortar gallery!, which was thus cleared of\nthe lime-casks and other buoyant articles; and, the alarm-bell being\nrung, all hands were called to render what assistance was in their power\nfor the safety of themselves and the materials.  At this time some would\nwillingly have left the beacon and gone into the building: the sea,\nhowever, ran so high that there was no passage along the bridge of\ncommunication, and, when the interior of the lighthouse came to be\nexamined in the morning, it appeared that great quantities of water had\ncome over the walls—now eighty feet in height—and had run down through\nthe several apartments and out at the entrance door.\n\nThe upper course of the lighthouse at the workyard of Arbroath was\ncompleted on the 6th, and the whole of the stones were, therefore, now\nready for being shipped to the rock.  From the present state of the works\nit was impossible that the two squads of artificers at Arbroath and the\nBell Rock could meet together at this period; and as in public works of\nthis kind, which had continued for a series of years, it is not customary\nto allow the men to separate without what is termed a “finishing-pint,”\nfive guineas were for this purpose placed at the disposal of Mr. David\nLogan, clerk of works.  With this sum the stone-cutters at Arbroath had a\nmerry meeting in their barrack, collected their sweethearts and friends,\nand concluded their labours with a dance.  It was remarked, however, that\ntheir happiness on this occasion was not without alloy.  The\nconsideration of parting and leaving a steady and regular employment, to\ngo in quest of work and mix with other society, after having been\nharmoniously lodged for years together in one large “guildhall or\nbarrack,” was rather painful.\n\n                                                        [Friday, 6th July]\n\nWhile the writer was at Edinburgh he was fortunate enough to meet with\nMrs. Dickson, only daughter of the late celebrated Mr. Smeaton, whose\nworks at the Eddystone Lighthouse had been of such essential consequence\nto the operations at the Bell Rock.  Even her own elegant accomplishments\nare identified with her father’s work, she having herself made the\ndrawing of the vignette on the title-page of the _Narrative of the\nEddystone Lighthouse_.  Every admirer of the works of that singularly\neminent man must also feel an obligation to her for the very\ncomprehensive and distinct account given of his life, which is attached\nto his reports, published, in three volumes quarto, by the Society of\nCivil Engineers.  Mrs. Dickson, being at this time returning from a tour\nto the Hebrides and Western Highlands of Scotland, had heard of the Bell\nRock works, and from their similarity to those of the Eddystone was\nstrongly impressed with a desire of visiting the spot.  But on inquiring\nfor the writer at Edinburgh, and finding from him that the upper part of\nthe lighthouse, consisting of nine courses, might be seen in the\nimmediate vicinity, and also that one of the vessels which, in compliment\nto her father’s memory, had been named the _Smeaton_, might also now be\nseen in Leith, she considered herself extremely fortunate; and having\nfirst visited the works at Greenside, she afterwards went to Leith to see\nthe _Smeaton_, then loading for the Bell Rock.  On stepping on board,\nMrs. Dickson seemed to be quite overcome with so many concurrent\ncircumstances, tending in a peculiar manner to revive and enliven the\nmemory of her departed father, and, on leaving the vessel, she would not\nbe restrained from presenting the crew with a piece of money.  The\n_Smeaton_ had been named spontaneously, from a sense of the obligation\nwhich a public work of the description of the Bell Rock owed to the\nlabours and abilities of Mr. Smeaton.  The writer certainly never could\nhave anticipated the satisfaction which he this day felt in witnessing\nthe pleasure it afforded to the only representative of this great man’s\nfamily.\n\n                                                       [Friday, 20th July]\n\nThe gale from the N.E. still continued so strong, accompanied with a\nheavy sea, that the _Patriot_ could not approach her moorings; and\nalthough the tender still kept her station, no landing was made to-day at\nthe rock.  At high-water it was remarked that the spray rose to the\nheight of about sixty feet upon the building.  The _Smeaton_ now lay in\nLeith loaded, but, the wind and weather being so unfavourable for her\ngetting down the Firth, she did not sail till this afternoon.  It may be\nhere proper to notice that the loading of the centre of the light-room\nfloor, or last principal stone of the building, did not fail, when put on\nboard, to excite an interest among those connected with the work.  When\nthe stone was laid upon the cart to be conveyed to Leith, the seamen\nfixed an ensign-staff and flag into the circular hole in the centre of\nthe stone, and decorated their own hats, and that of James Craw, the Bell\nRock carter, with ribbons; even his faithful and trusty horse Brassey was\nornamented with bows and streamers of various colours.  The masons also\nprovided themselves with new aprons, and in this manner the cart was\nattended in its progress to the ship.  When the cart came opposite the\nTrinity House of Leith, the officer of that corporation made his\nappearance dressed in his uniform, with his staff of office; and when it\nreached the harbour, the shipping in the different tiers where the\n_Smeaton_ lay hoisted their colours, manifesting by these trifling\nceremonies the interest with which the progress of this work was regarded\nby the public, as ultimately tending to afford safety and protection to\nthe mariner.  The wind had fortunately shifted to the S.W., and about\nfive o’clock this afternoon the _Smeaton_ reached the Bell Rock.\n\n                                                       [Friday, 27th July]\n\nThe artificers had finished the laying of the balcony course, excepting\nthe centre-stone of the light-room floor, which, like the centres of the\nother floors, could not be laid in its place till after the removal of\nthe foot and shaft of the balance-crane.  During the dinner-hour, when\nthe men were off work the writer generally took some exercise by walking\nround the walls when the rock was under water; but to-day his boundary\nwas greatly enlarged, for, instead of the narrow wall as a path, he felt\nno small degree of pleasure in walking round the balcony and passing out\nand in at the space allotted for the light-room door.  In the labours of\nthis day both the artificers and seamen felt their work to be extremely\neasy compared with what it had been for some days past.\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 29th July]\n\nCaptain Wilson and his crew had made preparations for landing the last\nstone, and, as may well be supposed, this was a day of great interest at\nthe Bell Rock.  ‘That it might lose none of its honours,’ as he expressed\nhimself, the _Hedderwick_ praam-boat, with which the first stone of the\nbuilding had been landed, was appointed also to carry the last.  At seven\no’clock this evening the seamen hoisted three flags upon the\n_Hedderwick_, when the colours of the _Dickie_ praam-boat, tender,\n_Smeaton_, floating light, beacon-house, and lighthouse were also\ndisplayed; and, the weather being remarkably fine, the whole presented a\nvery gay appearance, and, in connection with the associations excited,\nthe effect was very pleasing.  The praam which carried the stone was\ntowed by the seamen in gallant style to the rock, and, on its arrival,\ncheers were given as a finale to the landing department.\n\n                                                       [Monday, 30th July]\n\nThe ninetieth or last course of the building having been laid to-day,\nwhich brought the masonry to the height of one hundred and two feet six\ninches, the lintel of the light-room door, being the finishing-stone of\nthe exterior walls, was laid with due formality by the writer, who, at\nthe same time, pronounced the following benediction: “May the Great\nArchitect of the Universe, under whose blessing this perilous work has\nprospered, preserve it as a guide to the mariner.”\n\n                                                        [Friday, 3rd Aug.]\n\nAt three p.m., the necessary preparations having been made, the\nartificers commenced the completing of the floors of the several\napartments, and at seven o’clock the centre-stone of the light-room floor\nwas laid, which may be held as finishing the masonry of this important\nnational edifice.  After going through the usual ceremonies observed by\nthe brotherhood on occasions of this kind, the writer, addressing himself\nto the artificers and seamen who were present, briefly alluded to the\nutility of the undertaking as a monument of the wealth of British\ncommerce, erected through the spirited measures of the Commissioners of\nthe Northern Lighthouses by means of the able assistance of those who now\nsurrounded him.  He then took an opportunity of stating that toward those\nconnected with this arduous work he would ever retain the most heartfelt\nregard in all their interests.\n\n                                                      [Saturday, 4th Aug.]\n\nWhen the bell was rung as usual on the beacon this morning, every one\nseemed as if he were at a loss what to make of himself.  At this period\nthe artificers at the rock consisted of eighteen masons, two joiners, one\nmillwright, one smith, and one mortar-maker, besides Messrs. Peter Logan\nand Francis Watt, foremen, counting in all twenty-five; and matters were\narranged for proceeding to Arbroath this afternoon with all hands.  The\n_Sir Joseph Banks_ tender had by this time been afloat, with little\nintermission, for six months, during greater part of which the artificers\nhad been almost constantly off at the rock, and were now much in want of\nnecessaries of almost every description.  Not a few had lost different\narticles of clothing, which had dropped into the sea from the beacon and\nbuilding.  Some wanted jackets; others, from want of hats, wore\nnightcaps; each was, in fact, more or less curtailed in his wardrobe, and\nit must be confessed that at best the party were but in a very tattered\ncondition.  This morning was occupied in removing the artificers and\ntheir bedding on board of the tender; and although their personal luggage\nwas easily shifted, the boats had, nevertheless, many articles to remove\nfrom the beacon-house, and were consequently employed in this service\ntill eleven a.m.  All hands being collected and just ready to embark, as\nthe water had nearly overflowed the rock, the writer, in taking leave,\nafter alluding to the harmony which had ever marked the conduct of those\nemployed on the Bell Rock, took occasion to compliment the great zeal,\nattention, and abilities of Mr. Peter Logan and Mr. Francis Watt,\nforemen; Captain James Wilson, landing-master; and Captain David Taylor,\ncommander of the tender, who, in their several departments, had so\nfaithfully discharged the duties assigned to them, often under\ncircumstances the most difficult and trying.  The health of these\ngentlemen was drunk with much warmth of feeling by the artificers and\nseamen, who severally expressed the satisfaction they had experienced in\nacting under them; after which the whole party left the rock.\n\nIn sailing past the floating light mutual compliments were made by a\ndisplay of flags between that vessel and the tender; and at five p.m. the\nlatter vessel entered the harbour of Arbroath, where the party were\nheartily welcomed by a numerous company of spectators, who had collected\nto see the artificers arrive after so long an absence from the port.  In\nthe evening the writer invited the foremen and captains of the service,\ntogether with Mr. David Logan, clerk of works at Arbroath, and Mr.\nLachlan Kennedy, engineer’s clerk and book-keeper, and some of their\nfriends, to the principal inn, where the evening was spent very happily;\nand after ‘His Majesty’s Health’ and ‘The Commissioners of the Northern\nLighthouses’ had been given, ‘Stability to the Bell Rock Lighthouse’ was\nhailed as a standing toast in the Lighthouse service.\n\n                                                        [Sunday, 5th Aug.]\n\nThe author has formerly noticed the uniformly decent and orderly\ndeportment of the artificers who were employed at the Bell Rock\nLighthouse, and to-day, it is believed, they very generally attended\nchurch, no doubt with grateful hearts for the narrow escapes from\npersonal danger which all of them had more or less experienced during\ntheir residence at the rock.\n\n                                                      [Tuesday, 14th Aug.]\n\nThe _Smeaton_ sailed to-day at one p.m., having on board sixteen\nartificers, with Mr. Peter Logan, together with a supply of provisions\nand necessaries, who left the harbour pleased and happy to find\nthemselves once more afloat in the Bell Rock service.  At seven o’clock\nthe tender was made fast to her moorings, when the artificers landed on\nthe rock and took possession of their old quarters in the beacon-house,\nwith feelings very different from those of 1807, when the works\ncommenced.\n\nThe barometer for some days past had been falling from 29.90, and to-day\nit was 29.50, with the wind at N.E., which, in the course of this day,\nincreased to a strong gale accompanied with a sea which broke with great\nviolence upon the rock.  At twelve noon the tender rode very heavily at\nher moorings, when her chain broke at about ten fathoms from the ships\nbows. The kedge-anchor was immediately let go, to hold her till the\nfloating buoy and broken chain should be got on board.  But while this\nwas in operation the hawser of the kedge was chafed through on the rocky\nbottom and parted, when the vessel was again adrift.  Most fortunately,\nhowever, she cast off with her head from the rock, and narrowly cleared\nit, when she sailed up the Firth of Forth to wait the return of better\nweather.  The artificers were thus left upon the rock with so heavy a sea\nrunning that it was ascertained to have risen to a height of eighty feet\non the building.  Under such perilous circumstances it would be difficult\nto describe the feelings of those who, at this time, were cooped up in\nthe beacon in so forlorn a situation, with the sea not only raging under\nthem, but occasionally falling from a great height upon the roof of their\ntemporary lodging, without even the attending vessel in view to afford\nthe least gleam of hope in the event of any accident.  It is true that\nthey now had the masonry of the lighthouse to resort to, which, no doubt,\nlessened the actual danger of their situation; but the building was still\nwithout a roof, and the deadlights, or storm-shutters, not being yet\nfitted, the windows of the lower story were stove in and broken, and at\nhigh-water the sea ran in considerable quantities out at the entrance\ndoor.\n\n                                                     [Thursday, 16th Aug.]\n\nThe gale continues with unabated violence to-day, and the sprays rise to\na still greater height, having been carried over the masonry of the\nbuilding, or about ninety feet above the level of the sea.  At four\no’clock this morning it was breaking into the cook’s berth, when he rang\nthe alarm-bell, and all hands turned out to attend to their personal\nsafety.  The floor of the smith’s, or mortar gallery, was now completely\nburst up by the force of the sea, when the whole of the deals and the\nremaining articles upon the floor were swept away, such as the cast-iron\nmortar-tubs, the iron hearth of the forge, the smith’s bellows, and even\nhis anvil were thrown down upon the rock.  Before the tide rose to its\nfull height to-day some of the artificers passed along the bridge into\nthe lighthouse, to observe the effects of the sea upon it, and they\nreported that they had felt a slight tremulous motion in the building\nwhen great seas struck it in a certain direction, about high-water mark.\nOn this occasion the sprays were again observed to wet the balcony, and\neven to come over the parapet wall into the interior of the light-room.\n\n                                                     [Thursday, 23rd Aug.]\n\nThe wind being at W.S.W., and the weather more moderate, both the tender\nand the _Smeaton_ got to their moorings on the 23rd, when all hands were\nemployed in transporting the sash-frames from on board of the _Smeaton_\nto the rock.  In the act of setting up one of these frames upon the\nbridge, it was unguardedly suffered to lose its balance, and in saving it\nfrom damage Captain Wilson met with a severe bruise in the groin, on the\nseat of a gun-shot wound received in the early part of his life.  This\naccident laid him aside for several days.\n\n                                                       [Monday, 27th Aug.]\n\nThe sash-frames of the light-room, eight in number, and weighing each 254\npounds, having been got safely up to the top of the building, were ranged\non the balcony in the order in which they were numbered for their places\non the top of the parapet-wall; and the balance-crane, that useful\nmachine having now lifted all the heavier articles, was unscrewed and\nlowered, to use the landing-master’s phrase, ‘in mournful silence.’\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 2nd Sept.]\n\nThe steps of the stair being landed, and all the weightier articles of\nthe light-room got up to the balcony, the wooden bridge was now to be\nremoved, as it had a very powerful effect upon the beacon when a heavy\nsea struck it, and could not possibly have withstood the storms of a\nwinter.  Everything having been cleared from the bridge, and nothing left\nbut the two principal beams with their horizontal braces, James Glen, at\nhigh-water, proceeded with a saw to cut through the beams at the end next\nthe beacon, which likewise disengaged their opposite extremity, inserted\na few inches into the building.  The frame was then gently lowered into\nthe water, and floated off to the _Smeaton_ to be towed to Arbroath, to\nbe applied as part of the materials in the erection of the lightkeepers’\nhouses.  After the removal of the bridge, the aspect of things at the\nrock was much altered.  The beacon-house and building had both a naked\nlook to those accustomed to their former appearance; a curious optical\ndeception was also remarked, by which the lighthouse seemed to incline\nfrom the perpendicular towards the beacon.  The horizontal rope-ladder\nbefore noticed was again stretched to preserve the communication, and the\nartificers were once more obliged to practise the awkward and straddling\nmanner of their passage between them during 1809.\n\nAt twelve noon the bell rung for prayers, after which the artificers went\nto dinner, when the writer passed along the rope-ladder to the\nlighthouse, and went through the several apartments, which were now\ncleared of lumber.  In the afternoon all hands were summoned to the\ninterior of the house, when he had the satisfaction of laying the upper\nstep of the stair, or last stone of the building.  This ceremony\nconcluded with three cheers, the sound of which had a very loud and\nstrange effect within the walls of the lighthouse.  At six o’clock Mr.\nPeter Logan and eleven of the artificers embarked with the writer for\nArbroath, leaving Mr. James Glen with the special charge of the beacon\nand railways, Mr. Robert Selkirk with the building, with a few artificers\nto fit the temporary windows to render the house habitable.\n\n                                                       [Sunday, 14th Oct.]\n\nOn returning from his voyage to the Northern Lighthouses, the writer\nlanded at the Bell Rock on Sunday, the 14th of October, and had the\npleasure to find, from the very favourable state of the weather, that the\nartificers had been enabled to make great progress with the fitting-up of\nthe light-room.\n\n                                                       [Friday, 19th Oct.]\n\nThe light-room work had proceeded, as usual, to-day under the direction\nof Mr. Dove, assisted in the plumber-work by Mr. John Gibson, and in the\nbrazier-work by Mr. Joseph Fraser; while Mr. James Slight, with the\njoiners, were fitting up the storm-shuttters of the windows.  In these\nseveral departments the artificers were at work till seven o’clock p.m.,\nand it being then dark, Mr. Dove gave orders to drop work in the\nlight-room; and all hands proceeded from thence to the beacon-house, when\nCharles Henderson, smith, and Henry Dickson, brazier, left the work\ntogether.  Being both young men, who had been for several weeks upon the\nrock, they had become familiar, and even playful, on the most difficult\nparts about the beacon and building.  This evening they were trying to\noutrun each other in descending from the light-room, when Henderson led\nthe way; but they were in conversation with each other till they came to\nthe rope-ladder distended between the entrance-door of the lighthouse and\nthe beacon.  Dickson, on reaching the cook-room, was surprised at not\nseeing his companion, and inquired hastily for Henderson.  Upon which the\ncook replied, ‘Was he before you upon the rope-ladder?’  Dickson\nanswered, ‘Yes; and I thought I heard something fall.’  Upon this the\nalarm was given, and links were immediately lighted, with which the\nartificers descended on the legs of the beacon, as near the surface of\nthe water as possible, it being then about full tide, and the sea\nbreaking to a considerable height upon the building, with the wind at\nS.S.E.  But, after watching till low-water, and searching in every\ndirection upon the rock, it appeared that poor Henderson must have\nunfortunately fallen through the rope-ladder, and been washed into the\ndeep water.\n\nThe deceased had passed along this rope-ladder many hundred times, both\nby day and night, and the operations in which he was employed being\nnearly finished, he was about to leave the rock when this melancholy\ncatastrophe took place.  The unfortunate loss of Henderson cast a deep\ngloom upon the minds of all who were at the rock, and it required some\nmanagement on the part of those who had charge to induce the people to\nremain patiently at their work; as the weather now became more\nboisterous, and the nights long, they found their habitation extremely\ncheerless, while the winds were howling about their ears, and the waves\nlashing with fury against the beams of their insulated habitation.\n\n                                                      [Tuesday, 23rd Oct.]\n\nThe wind had shifted in the night to N.W., and blew a fresh gale, while\nthe sea broke with violence upon the rock.  It was found impossible to\nland, but the writer, from the boat, hailed Mr. Dove, and directed the\nball to be immediately fixed.  The necessary preparations were\naccordingly made, while the vessel made short tacks on the southern side\nof the rock, in comparatively smooth water.  At noon Mr. Dove, assisted\nby Mr. James Slight, Mr. Robert Selkirk, Mr. James Glen, and Mr. John\nGibson, plumber, with considerable difficulty, from the boisterous state\nof the weather, got the gilded ball screwed on, measuring two feet in\ndiameter, and forming the principal ventilator at the upper extremity of\nthe cupola of the light-room.  At Mr. Hamilton’s desire, a salute of\nseven guns was fired on this occasion, and, all hands being called to the\nquarter-deck, ‘Stability to the Bell Rock Lighthouse’ was not forgotten.\n\n                                                      [Tuesday, 30th Oct.]\n\nOn reaching the rock it was found that a very heavy sea still ran upon\nit; but the writer having been disappointed on two former occasions, and,\nas the erection of the house might now be considered complete, there\nbeing nothing wanted externally, excepting some of the storm-shutters for\nthe defence of the windows, he was the more anxious at this time to\ninspect it.  Two well-manned boats were therefore ordered to be in\nattendance; and, after some difficulty, the wind being at N.N.E., they\ngot safely into the western creek, though not without encountering\nplentiful sprays.  It would have been impossible to have attempted a\nlanding to-day, under any other circumstances than with boats perfectly\nadapted to the purpose, and with seamen who knew every ledge of the rock,\nand even the length of the sea-weeds at each particular spot, so as to\ndip their oars into the water accordingly, and thereby prevent them from\ngetting entangled.  But what was of no less consequence to the safety of\nthe party, Captain Wilson, who always steered the boat, had a perfect\nknowledge of the set of the different waves, while the crew never shifted\ntheir eyes from observing his motions, and the strictest silence was\npreserved by every individual except himself.\n\nOn entering the house, the writer had the pleasure to find it in a\nsomewhat habitable condition, the lower apartments being closed in with\ntemporary windows, and fitted with proper storm-shutters.  The lowest\napartment at the head of the staircase was occupied with water, fuel, and\nprovisions, put up in a temporary way until the house could be furnished\nwith proper utensils.  The second, or light-room store, was at present\nmuch encumbered with various tools and apparatus for the use of the\nworkmen.  The kitchen immediately over this had, as yet, been supplied\nonly with a common ship’s caboose and plate-iron funnel, while the\nnecessary cooking utensils had been taken from the beacon.  The bedroom\nwas for the present used as the joiners’ workshop, and the strangers’\nroom, immediately under the light-room, was occupied by the artificers,\nthe beds being ranged in tiers, as was done in the barrack of the beacon.\nThe light-room, though unprovided with its machinery, being now covered\nover with the cupola, glazed and painted, had a very complete and cleanly\nappearance.  The balcony was only as yet fitted with a temporary rail,\nconsisting of a few iron stanchions, connected with ropes; and in this\nstate it was necessary to leave it during the winter.\n\nHaving gone over the whole of the low-water works on the rock, the\nbeacon, and lighthouse, and being satisfied that only the most untoward\naccident in the landing of the machinery could prevent the exhibition of\nthe light in the course of the winter, Mr. John Reid, formerly of the\nfloating light, was now put in charge of the lighthouse as principal\nkeeper; Mr. James Slight had charge of the operations of the artificers,\nwhile Mr. James Dove and the smiths, having finished the frame of the\nlight-room, left the rock for the present.  With these arrangements the\nwriter bade adieu to the works for the season.  At eleven a.m. the tide\nwas far advanced; and there being now little or no shelter for the boats\nat the rock, they had to be pulled through the breach of sea, which came\non board in great quantities, and it was with extreme difficulty that\nthey could be kept in the proper direction of the landing-creek.  On this\noccasion he may be permitted to look back with gratitude on the many\nescapes made in the course of this arduous undertaking, now brought so\nnear to a successful conclusion.\n\n                                                        [Monday, 5th Nov.]\n\nOn Monday, the 5th, the yacht again visited the rock, when Mr. Slight and\nthe artificers returned with her to the workyard, where a number of\nthings were still to prepare connected with the temporary fitting up of\nthe accommodation for the lightkeepers.  Mr. John Reid and Peter Fortune\nwere now the only inmates of the house.  This was the smallest number of\npersons hitherto left in the lighthouse.  As four lightkeepers were to be\nthe complement, it was intended that three should always be at the rock.\nIts present inmates, however, could hardly have been better selected for\nsuch a situation; Mr. Reid being a person possessed of the strictest\nnotions of duty and habits of regularity from long service on board of a\nman-of-war, while Mr. Fortune had one of the most happy and contented\ndispositions imaginable.\n\n                                                      [Tuesday, 13th Nov.]\n\nFrom Saturday the 10th till Tuesday the 13th, the wind had been from N.E.\nblowing a heavy gale; but to-day, the weather having greatly moderated,\nCaptain Taylor, who now commanded the _Smeaton_, sailed at two o’clock\na.m. for the Bell Rock.  At five the floating light was hailed and found\nto be all well.  Being a fine moonlight morning, the seamen were changed\nfrom the one ship to the other.  At eight, the _Smeaton_ being off the\nrock, the boats were manned, and taking a supply of water, fuel, and\nother necessaries, landed at the western side, when Mr. Reid and Mr.\nFortune were found in good health and spirits.\n\nMr. Reid stated that during the late gales, particularly on Friday, the\n30th, the wind veering from S.E. to N.E., both he and Mr. Fortune\nsensibly felt the house tremble when particular seas struck, about the\ntime of high-water; the former observing that it was a tremor of that\nsort which rather tended to convince him that everything about the\nbuilding was sound, and reminded him of the effect produced when a good\nlog of timber is struck sharply with a mallet; but, with every confidence\nin the stability of the building, he nevertheless confessed that, in so\nforlorn a situation, they were not insensible to those emotions which, he\nemphatically observed, ‘made a man look back upon his former life.’\n\n                                                   [1881 Friday, 1st Feb.]\n\nThe day, long wished for, on which the mariner was to see a light\nexhibited on the Bell Rock at length arrived.  Captain Wilson, as usual,\nhoisted the float’s lanterns to the topmast on the evening of the 1st of\nFebruary; but the moment that the light appeared on the rock, the crew,\ngiving three cheers, lowered them, and finally extinguished the lights.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n         Printed by T. and A.

All we know about\nthe engineer family is that it was sprung from a stock of Westland Whigs\nsettled in the latter part of the seventeenth century in the parish of\nNeilston, as mentioned at the beginning of the next chapter.  It may be\nnoted that the Ayrshire parish of Stevenston, the lands of which are said\nto have received the name in the twelfth century, lies within thirteen\nmiles south-west of this place.

Repeated attempts had been\nmade to mark the place with beacons, but all efforts were unavailing (one\nsuch beacon having been carried away within eight days of its erection)\nuntil Robert Stevenson conceived and carried out the idea of the stone\ntower.  But the number of vessels actually lost upon the reef was as\nnothing to those that were cast away in fruitless efforts to avoid it.\nPlaced right in the fairway of two navigations, and one of these the\nentrance to the only harbour of refuge between the Downs and the Moray\nFirth, it breathed abroad along the whole coast an atmosphere of terror\nand perplexity; and no ship sailed that part of the North Sea at night,\nbut what the ears of those on board would be strained to catch the\nroaring of the seas on the Bell Rock.\n\n{92a}  The particular event which concentrated Mr. Stevenson’s attention\non the problem of the Bell Rock was the memorable gale of December 1799,\nwhen, among many other vessels, H.M.S. _York_, a seventy-four-gun ship,\nwent down with all hands on board.  Shortly after this disaster Mr.\nStevenson made a careful survey, and prepared his models for a stone\ntower, the idea of which was at first received with pretty general\nscepticism, Smeaton’s Eddystone tower could not be cited as affording a\nparallel, for there the rock is not submerged even at high-water, while\nthe problem of the Bell Rock was to build a tower of masonry on a sunken\nreef far distant from land, covered at every tide to a depth of twelve\nfeet or more, and having thirty-two fathoms’ depth of water within a mile\nof its eastern edge.\n\n{94a}  The grounds for the rejection of the Bill by the House of Lords in\n1802–3 had been that the extent of coast over which dues were proposed to\nbe levied would be too great.  Before going to Parliament again, the\nBoard of Northern Lights, desiring to obtain support and corroboration\nfor Mr. Stevenson’s views, consulted first Telford, who was unable to\ngive the matter his attention, and then (on Stevenson’s suggestion)\nRennie, who concurred in affirming the practicability of a stone tower,\nand supported the Bill when it came again before Parliament in 1806.\nRennie was afterwards appointed by the Commissioners as advising\nengineer, whom Stevenson might consult in cases of emergency.  It seems\ncertain that the title of chief engineer had in this instance no more\nmeaning than the above.  Rennie, in point of fact, proposed certain\nmodifications in Stevenson’s plans, which the latter did not accept;\nnevertheless Rennie continued to take a kindly interest in the work, and\nthe two engineers remained in friendly correspondence during its\nprogress.  The official view taken by the Board as to the quarter in\nwhich lay both the merit and the responsibility of the work may be\ngathered from a minute of the Commissioners at their first meeting held\nafter Stevenson died; in which they record their regret ‘at the death of\nthis zealous, faithful, and able officer, _to whom is due the honour of\nconceiving and executing the Bell Rock Lighthouse_.’  The matter is\nbriefly summed up in the _Life_ of Robert Stevenson by his son David\nStevenson (A. & C. Black, 1878), and fully discussed, on the basis of\nofficial facts and figures, by the same writer in a letter to the _Civil\nEngineers’ and Architects’ Journal_, 1862.\n\n{122a}  ‘Nothing was said, but I was _looked out of countenance_,’ he\nsays in a letter.\n\n{171a}  Ill-formed—ugly.—[R. L. S.]\n\n{174a}  This is an incurable illusion of my grandfather’s; he always\nwrites ‘distended’ for ‘extended.’—[R. L. S.]",
