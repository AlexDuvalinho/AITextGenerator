All our arts and occupations lie wholly on the\nsurface; it is on the surface that we perceive their beauty, fitness, and\nsignificance; and to pry below is to be appalled by their emptiness and\nshocked by the coarseness of the strings and pulleys.  In a similar way,\npsychology itself, when pushed to any nicety, discovers an abhorrent\nbaldness, but rather from the fault of our analysis than from any poverty\nnative to the mind.  And perhaps in æsthetics the reason is the same:\nthose disclosures which seem fatal to the dignity of art seem so perhaps\nonly in the proportion of our ignorance; and those conscious and\nunconscious artifices which it seems unworthy of the serious artist to\nemploy were yet, if we had the power to trace them to their springs,\nindications of a delicacy of the sense finer than we conceive, and hints\nof ancient harmonies in nature.  This ignorance at least is largely\nirremediable.  We shall never learn the affinities of beauty, for they\nlie too deep in nature and too far back in the mysterious history of man.\nThe amateur, in consequence, will always grudgingly receive details of\nmethod, which can be stated but never can wholly be explained; nay, on\nthe principle laid down in _Hudibras_, that\n\n             ‘Still the less they understand,\n    The more they admire the sleight-of-hand,’\n\nmany are conscious at each new disclosure of a diminution in the ardour\nof their pleasure.  I must therefore warn that well-known character, the\ngeneral reader, that I am here embarked upon a most distasteful business:\ntaking down the picture from the wall and looking on the back; and, like\nthe inquiring child, pulling the musical cart to pieces.\n\n1.  _Choice of Words_.—The art of literature stands apart from among its\nsisters, because the material in which the literary artist works is the\ndialect of life; hence, on the one hand, a strange freshness and\nimmediacy of address to the public mind, which is ready prepared to\nunderstand it; but hence, on the other, a singular limitation.  The\nsister arts enjoy the use of a plastic and ductile material, like the\nmodeller’s clay; literature alone is condemned to work in mosaic with\nfinite and quite rigid words.  You have seen these blocks, dear to the\nnursery: this one a pillar, that a pediment, a third a window or a vase.\nIt is with blocks of just such arbitrary size and figure that the\nliterary architect is condemned to design the palace of his art.  Nor is\nthis all; for since these blocks, or words, are the acknowledged currency\nof our daily affairs, there are here possible none of those suppressions\nby which other arts obtain relief, continuity, and vigour: no\nhieroglyphic touch, no smoothed impasto, no inscrutable shadow, as in\npainting; no blank wall, as in architecture; but every word, phrase,\nsentence, and paragraph must move in a logical progression, and convey a\ndefinite conventional import.\n\nNow the first merit which attracts in the pages of a good writer, or the\ntalk of a brilliant conversationalist, is the apt choice and contrast of\nthe words employed.  It is, indeed, a strange art to take these blocks,\nrudely conceived for the purpose of the market or the bar, and by tact of\napplication touch them to the finest meanings and distinctions, restore\nto them their primal energy, wittily shift them to another issue, or make\nof them a drum to rouse the passions.  But though this form of merit is\nwithout doubt the most sensible and seizing, it is far from being equally\npresent in all writers.  The effect of words in Shakespeare, their\nsingular justice, significance, and poetic charm, is different, indeed,\nfrom the effect of words in Addison or Fielding.  Or, to take an example\nnearer home, the words in Carlyle seem electrified into an energy of\nlineament, like the faces of men furiously moved; whilst the words in\nMacaulay, apt enough to convey his meaning, harmonious enough in sound,\nyet glide from the memory like undistinguished elements in a general\neffect.  But the first class of writers have no monopoly of literary\nmerit.  There is a sense in which Addison is superior to Carlyle; a sense\nin which Cicero is better than Tacitus, in which Voltaire excels\nMontaigne: it certainly lies not in the choice of words; it lies not in\nthe interest or value of the matter; it lies not in force of intellect,\nof poetry, or of humour.  The three first are but infants to the three\nsecond; and yet each, in a particular point of literary art, excels his\nsuperior in the whole.  What is that point?\n\n2.  _The Web_.—Literature, although it stands apart by reason of the\ngreat destiny and general use of its medium in the affairs of men, is yet\nan art like other arts.  Of these we may distinguish two great classes:\nthose arts, like sculpture, painting, acting, which are representative,\nor, as used to be said very clumsily, imitative; and those, like\narchitecture, music, and the dance, which are self-sufficient, and merely\npresentative.  Each class, in right of this distinction, obeys principles\napart; yet both may claim a common ground of existence, and it may be\nsaid with sufficient justice that the motive and end of any art whatever\nis to make a pattern; a pattern, it may be, of colours, of sounds, of\nchanging attitudes, geometrical figures, or imitative lines; but still a\npattern.  That is the plane on which these sisters meet; it is by this\nthat they are arts; and if it be well they should at times forget their\nchildish origin, addressing their intelligence to virile tasks, and\nperforming unconsciously that necessary function of their life, to make a\npattern, it is still imperative that the pattern shall be made.\n\nMusic and literature, the two temporal arts, contrive their pattern of\nsounds in time; or, in other words, of sounds and pauses.  Communication\nmay be made in broken words, the business of life be carried on with\nsubstantives alone; but that is not what we call literature; and the true\nbusiness of the literary artist is to plait or weave his meaning,\ninvolving it around itself; so that each sentence, by successive phrases,\nshall first come into a kind of knot, and then, after a moment of\nsuspended meaning, solve and clear itself.  In every properly constructed\nsentence there should be observed this knot or hitch; so that (however\ndelicately) we are led to foresee, to expect, and then to welcome the\nsuccessive phrases.  The pleasure may be heightened by an element of\nsurprise, as, very grossly, in the common figure of the antithesis, or,\nwith much greater subtlety, where an antithesis is first suggested and\nthen deftly evaded.  Each phrase, besides, is to be comely in itself; and\nbetween the implication and the evolution of the sentence there should be\na satisfying equipoise of sound; for nothing more often disappoints the\near than a sentence solemnly and sonorously prepared, and hastily and\nweakly finished.  Nor should the balance be too striking and exact, for\nthe one rule is to be infinitely various; to interest, to disappoint, to\nsurprise, and yet still to gratify; to be ever changing, as it were, the\nstitch, and yet still to give the effect of an ingenious neatness.\n\nThe conjurer juggles with two oranges, and our pleasure in beholding him\nsprings from this, that neither is for an instant overlooked or\nsacrificed.  So with the writer.  His pattern, which is to please the\nsupersensual ear, is yet addressed, throughout and first of all, to the\ndemands of logic.  Whatever be the obscurities, whatever the intricacies\nof the argument, the neatness of the fabric must not suffer, or the\nartist has been proved unequal to his design.  And, on the other hand, no\nform of words must be selected, no knot must be tied among the phrases,\nunless knot and word be precisely what is wanted to forward and\nilluminate the argument; for to fail in this is to swindle in the game.\nThe genius of prose rejects the _cheville_ no less emphatically than the\nlaws of verse; and the _cheville_, I should perhaps explain to some of my\nreaders, is any meaningless or very watered phrase employed to strike a\nbalance in the sound.  Pattern and argument live in each other; and it is\nby the brevity, clearness, charm, or emphasis of the second, that we\njudge the strength and fitness of the first.\n\nStyle is synthetic; and the artist, seeking, so to speak, a peg to plait\nabout, takes up at once two or more elements or two or more views of the\nsubject in hand; combines, implicates, and contrasts them; and while, in\none sense, he was merely seeking an occasion for the necessary knot, he\nwill be found, in the other, to have greatly enriched the meaning, or to\nhave transacted the work of two sentences in the space of one.  In the\nchange from the successive shallow statements of the old chronicler to\nthe dense and luminous flow of highly synthetic narrative, there is\nimplied a vast amount of both philosophy and wit.  The philosophy we\nclearly see, recognising in the synthetic writer a far more deep and\nstimulating view of life, and a far keener sense of the generation and\naffinity of events.  The wit we might imagine to be lost; but it is not\nso, for it is just that wit, these perpetual nice contrivances, these\ndifficulties overcome, this double purpose attained, these two oranges\nkept simultaneously dancing in the air, that, consciously or not, afford\nthe reader his delight.  Nay, and this wit, so little recognised, is the\nnecessary organ of that philosophy which we so much admire.  That style\nis therefore the most perfect, not, as fools say, which is the most\nnatural, for the most natural is the disjointed babble of the chronicler;\nbut which attains the highest degree of elegant and pregnant implication\nunobtrusively; or if obtrusively, then with the greatest gain to sense\nand vigour.  Even the derangement of the phrases from their (so-called)\nnatural order is luminous for the mind; and it is by the means of such\ndesigned reversal that the elements of a judgment may be most pertinently\nmarshalled, or the stages of a complicated action most perspicuously\nbound into one.\n\nThe web, then, or the pattern: a web at once sensuous and logical, an\nelegant and pregnant texture: that is style, that is the foundation of\nthe art of literature.  Books indeed continue to be read, for the\ninterest of the fact or fable, in which this quality is poorly\nrepresented, but still it will be there.  And, on the other hand, how\nmany do we continue to peruse and reperuse with pleasure whose only merit\nis the elegance of texture?  I am tempted to mention Cicero; and since\nMr. Anthony Trollope is dead, I will.  It is a poor diet for the mind, a\nvery colourless and toothless ‘criticism of life’; but we enjoy the\npleasure of a most intricate and dexterous pattern, every stitch a model\nat once of elegance and of good sense; and the two oranges, even if one\nof them be rotten, kept dancing with inimitable grace.\n\nUp to this moment I have had my eye mainly upon prose; for though in\nverse also the implication of the logical texture is a crowning beauty,\nyet in verse it may be dispensed with.  You would think that here was a\ndeath-blow to all I have been saying; and far from that, it is but a new\nillustration of the principle involved.  For if the versifier is not\nbound to weave a pattern of his own, it is because another pattern has\nbeen formally imposed upon him by the laws of verse.  For that is the\nessence of a prosody.  Verse may be rhythmical; it may be merely\nalliterative; it may, like the French, depend wholly on the (quasi)\nregular recurrence of the rhyme; or, like the Hebrew, it may consist in\nthe strangely fanciful device of repeating the same idea.  It does not\nmatter on what principle the law is based, so it be a law.  It may be\npure convention; it may have no inherent beauty; all that we have a right\nto ask of any prosody is, that it shall lay down a pattern for the\nwriter, and that what it lays down shall be neither too easy nor too\nhard.  Hence it comes that it is much easier for men of equal facility to\nwrite fairly pleasing verse than reasonably interesting prose; for in\nprose the pattern itself has to be invented, and the difficulties first\ncreated before they can be solved.  Hence, again, there follows the\npeculiar greatness of the true versifier: such as Shakespeare, Milton,\nand Victor Hugo, whom I place beside them as versifier merely, not as\npoet.  These not only knit and knot the logical texture of the style with\nall the dexterity and strength of prose; they not only fill up the\npattern of the verse with infinite variety and sober wit; but they give\nus, besides, a rare and special pleasure, by the art, comparable to that\nof counterpoint, with which they follow at the same time, and now\ncontrast, and now combine, the double pattern of the texture and the\nverse.  Here the sounding line concludes; a little further on, the\nwell-knit sentence; and yet a little further, and both will reach their\nsolution on the same ringing syllable.  The best that can be offered by\nthe best writer of prose is to show us the development of the idea and\nthe stylistic pattern proceed hand in hand, sometimes by an obvious and\ntriumphant effort, sometimes with a great air of ease and nature.  The\nwriter of verse, by virtue of conquering another difficulty, delights us\nwith a new series of triumphs.  He follows three purposes where his rival\nfollowed only two; and the change is of precisely the same nature as that\nfrom melody to harmony.  Or if you prefer to return to the juggler,\nbehold him now, to the vastly increased enthusiasm of the spectators,\njuggling with three oranges instead of two.  Thus it is: added\ndifficulty, added beauty; and the pattern, with every fresh element,\nbecoming more interesting in itself.\n\nYet it must not be thought that verse is simply an addition; something is\nlost as well as something gained; and there remains plainly traceable, in\ncomparing the best prose with the best verse, a certain broad distinction\nof method in the web.  Tight as the versifier may draw the knot of logic,\nyet for the ear he still leaves the tissue of the sentence floating\nsomewhat loose.  In prose, the sentence turns upon a pivot, nicely\nbalanced, and fits into itself with an obtrusive neatness like a puzzle.\nThe ear remarks and is singly gratified by this return and balance; while\nin verse it is all diverted to the measure.  To find comparable passages\nis hard; for either the versifier is hugely the superior of the rival,\nor, if he be not, and still persist in his more delicate enterprise, he\nfails to be as widely his inferior.  But let us select them from the\npages of the same writer, one who was ambidexter; let us take, for\ninstance, Rumour’s Prologue to the Second Part of _Henry IV._, a fine\nflourish of eloquence in Shakespeare’s second manner, and set it side by\nside with Falstaff’s praise of sherris, act iv. scene iii.; or let us\ncompare the beautiful prose spoken throughout by Rosalind and Orlando;\ncompare, for example, the first speech of all, Orlando’s speech to Adam,\nwith what passage it shall please you to select—the Seven Ages from the\nsame play, or even such a stave of nobility as Othello’s farewell to war;\nand still you will be able to perceive, if you have an ear for that class\nof music, a certain superior degree of organisation in the prose; a\ncompacter fitting of the parts; a balance in the swing and the return as\nof a throbbing pendulum.  We must not, in things temporal, take from\nthose who have little, the little that they have; the merits of prose are\ninferior, but they are not the same; it is a little kingdom, but an\nindependent.\n\n3.  _Rhythm of the Phrase_.—Some way back, I used a word which still\nawaits an application.  Each phrase, I said, was to be comely; but what\nis a comely phrase?  In all ideal and material points, literature, being\na representative art, must look for analogies to painting and the like;\nbut in what is technical and executive, being a temporal art, it must\nseek for them in music.  Each phrase of each sentence, like an air or a\nrecitative in music, should be so artfully compounded out of long and\nshort, out of accented and unaccented, as to gratify the sensual ear.\nAnd of this the ear is the sole judge.  It is impossible to lay down\nlaws.  Even in our accentual and rhythmic language no analysis can find\nthe secret of the beauty of a verse; how much less, then, of those\nphrases, such as prose is built of, which obey no law but to be lawless\nand yet to please?  The little that we know of verse (and for my part I\nowe it all to my friend Professor Fleeming Jenkin) is, however,\nparticularly interesting in the present connection.  We have been\naccustomed to describe the heroic line as five iambic feet, and to be\nfilled with pain and confusion whenever, as by the conscientious\nschoolboy, we have heard our own description put in practice.\n\n    ‘All night | the dreàd | less àn | gel ùn | pursùed,’ {21}\n\ngoes the schoolboy; but though we close our ears, we cling to our\ndefinition, in spite of its proved and naked insufficiency.  Mr. Jenkin\nwas not so easily pleased, and readily discovered that the heroic line\nconsists of four groups, or, if you prefer the phrase, contains four\npauses:\n\n    ‘All night | the dreadless | angel | unpursued.’\n\nFour groups, each practically uttered as one word: the first, in this\ncase, an iamb; the second, an amphibrachys; the third, a trochee; and the\nfourth, an amphimacer; and yet our schoolboy, with no other liberty but\nthat of inflicting pain, had triumphantly scanned it as five iambs.\nPerceive, now, this fresh richness of intricacy in the web; this fourth\norange, hitherto unremarked, but still kept flying with the others.  What\nhad seemed to be one thing it now appears is two; and, like some puzzle\nin arithmetic, the verse is made at the same time to read in fives and to\nread in fours.\n\nBut again, four is not necessary.  We do not, indeed, find verses in six\ngroups, because there is not room for six in the ten syllables; and we do\nnot find verses of two, because one of the main distinctions of verse\nfrom prose resides in the comparative shortness of the group; but it is\neven common to find verses of three.  Five is the one forbidden number;\nbecause five is the number of the feet; and if five were chosen, the two\npatterns would coincide, and that opposition which is the life of verse\nwould instantly be lost.  We have here a clue to the effect of\npolysyllables, above all in Latin, where they are so common and make so\nbrave an architecture in the verse; for the polysyllable is a group of\nNature’s making.  If but some Roman would return from Hades (Martial, for\nchoice), and tell me by what conduct of the voice these thundering verses\nshould be uttered—‘_Aut Lacedæmonium Tarentum_,’ for a case in point—I\nfeel as if I should enter at last into the full enjoyment of the best of\nhuman verses.\n\nBut, again, the five feet are all iambic, or supposed to be; by the mere\ncount of syllables the four groups cannot be all iambic; as a question of\nelegance, I doubt if any one of them requires to be so; and I am certain\nthat for choice no two of them should scan the same.  The singular beauty\nof the verse analysed above is due, so far as analysis can carry us,\npart, indeed, to the clever repetition of L, D, and N, but part to this\nvariety of scansion in the groups.  The groups which, like the bar in\nmusic, break up the verse for utterance, fall uniambically; and in\ndeclaiming a so-called iambic verse, it may so happen that we never utter\none iambic foot.  And yet to this neglect of the original beat there is a\nlimit.\n\n    ‘Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts,’ {24}\n\nis, with all its eccentricities, a good heroic line; for though it\nscarcely can be said to indicate the beat of the iamb, it certainly\nsuggests no other measure to the ear.  But begin\n\n    ‘Mother Athens, eye of Greece,’\n\nor merely ‘Mother Athens,’ and the game is up, for the trochaic beat has\nbeen suggested.  The eccentric scansion of the groups is an adornment;\nbut as soon as the original beat has been forgotten, they cease\nimplicitly to be eccentric.  Variety is what is sought; but if we destroy\nthe original mould, one of the terms of this variety is lost, and we fall\nback on sameness.  Thus, both as to the arithmetical measure of the\nverse, and the degree of regularity in scansion, we see the laws of\nprosody to have one common purpose: to keep alive the opposition of two\nschemes simultaneously followed; to keep them notably apart, though still\ncoincident; and to balance them with such judicial nicety before the\nreader, that neither shall be unperceived and neither signally prevail.\n\nThe rule of rhythm in prose is not so intricate.  Here, too, we write in\ngroups, or phrases, as I prefer to call them, for the prose phrase is\ngreatly longer and is much more nonchalantly uttered than the group in\nverse; so that not only is there a greater interval of continuous sound\nbetween the pauses, but, for that very reason, word is linked more\nreadily to word by a more summary enunciation.  Still, the phrase is the\nstrict analogue of the group, and successive phrases, like successive\ngroups, must differ openly in length and rhythm.  The rule of scansion in\nverse is to suggest no measure but the one in hand; in prose, to suggest\nno measure at all.  Prose must be rhythmical, and it may be as much so as\nyou will; but it must not be metrical.  It may be anything, but it must\nnot be verse.  A single heroic line may very well pass and not disturb\nthe somewhat larger stride of the prose style; but one following another\nwill produce an instant impression of poverty, flatness, and\ndisenchantment.  The same lines delivered with the measured utterance of\nverse would perhaps seem rich in variety.  By the more summary\nenunciation proper to prose, as to a more distant vision, these niceties\nof difference are lost.  A whole verse is uttered as one phrase; and the\near is soon wearied by a succession of groups identical in length.  The\nprose writer, in fact, since he is allowed to be so much less harmonious,\nis condemned to a perpetually fresh variety of movement on a larger\nscale, and must never disappoint the ear by the trot of an accepted\nmetre.  And this obligation is the third orange with which he has to\njuggle, the third quality which the prose writer must work into his\npattern of words.  It may be thought perhaps that this is a quality of\nease rather than a fresh difficulty; but such is the inherently\nrhythmical strain of the English language, that the bad writer—and must I\ntake for example that admired friend of my boyhood, Captain Reid?—the\ninexperienced writer, as Dickens in his earlier attempts to be\nimpressive, and the jaded writer, as any one may see for himself, all\ntend to fall at once into the production of bad blank verse.  And here it\nmay be pertinently asked, Why bad?  And I suppose it might be enough to\nanswer that no man ever made good verse by accident, and that no verse\ncan ever sound otherwise than trivial when uttered with the delivery of\nprose.  But we can go beyond such answers.  The weak side of verse is the\nregularity of the beat, which in itself is decidedly less impressive than\nthe movement of the nobler prose; and it is just into this weak side, and\nthis alone, that our careless writer falls.  A peculiar density and mass,\nconsequent on the nearness of the pauses, is one of the chief good\nqualities of verse; but this our accidental versifier, still following\nafter the swift gait and large gestures of prose, does not so much as\naspire to imitate.  Lastly, since he remains unconscious that he is\nmaking verse at all, it can never occur to him to extract those effects\nof counterpoint and opposition which I have referred to as the final\ngrace and justification of verse, and, I may add, of blank verse in\nparticular.\n\n4.  _Contents of the Phrase_.—Here is a great deal of talk about\nrhythm—and naturally; for in our canorous language rhythm is always at\nthe door.  But it must not be forgotten that in some languages this\nelement is almost, if not quite, extinct, and that in our own it is\nprobably decaying.  The even speech of many educated Americans sounds the\nnote of danger.  I should see it go with something as bitter as despair,\nbut I should not be desperate.  As in verse no element, not even rhythm,\nis necessary, so, in prose also, other sorts of beauty will arise and\ntake the place and play the part of those that we outlive.  The beauty of\nthe expected beat in verse, the beauty in prose of its larger and more\nlawless melody, patent as they are to English hearing, are already silent\nin the ears of our next neighbours; for in France the oratorical accent\nand the pattern of the web have almost or altogether succeeded to their\nplaces; and the French prose writer would be astounded at the labours of\nhis brother across the Channel, and how a good quarter of his toil, above\nall _invita Minerva_, is to avoid writing verse.  So wonderfully far\napart have races wandered in spirit, and so hard it is to understand the\nliterature next door!\n\nYet French prose is distinctly better than English; and French verse,\nabove all while Hugo lives, it will not do to place upon one side.  What\nis more to our purpose, a phrase or a verse in French is easily\ndistinguishable as comely or uncomely.  There is then another element of\ncomeliness hitherto overlooked in this analysis: the contents of the\nphrase.  Each phrase in literature is built of sounds, as each phrase in\nmusic consists of notes.  One sound suggests, echoes, demands, and\nharmonises with another; and the art of rightly using these concordances\nis the final art in literature.  It used to be a piece of good advice to\nall young writers to avoid alliteration; and the advice was sound, in so\nfar as it prevented daubing.  None the less for that, was it abominable\nnonsense, and the mere raving of those blindest of the blind who will not\nsee.  The beauty of the contents of a phrase, or of a sentence, depends\nimplicitly upon alliteration and upon assonance.  The vowel demands to be\nrepeated; the consonant demands to be repeated; and both cry aloud to be\nperpetually varied.  You may follow the adventures of a letter through\nany passage that has particularly pleased you; find it, perhaps, denied a\nwhile, to tantalise the ear; find it fired again at you in a whole\nbroadside; or find it pass into congenerous sounds, one liquid or labial\nmelting away into another.  And you will find another and much stranger\ncircumstance.  Literature is written by and for two senses: a sort of\ninternal ear, quick to perceive ‘unheard melodies’; and the eye, which\ndirects the pen and deciphers the printed phrase.  Well, even as there\nare rhymes for the eye, so you will find that there are assonances and\nalliterations; that where an author is running the open A, deceived by\nthe eye and our strange English spelling, he will often show a tenderness\nfor the flat A; and that where he is running a particular consonant, he\nwill not improbably rejoice to write it down even when it is mute or\nbears a different value.\n\nHere, then, we have a fresh pattern—a pattern, to speak grossly, of\nletters—which makes the fourth preoccupation of the prose writer, and the\nfifth of the versifier.  At times it is very delicate and hard to\nperceive, and then perhaps most excellent and winning (I say perhaps);\nbut at times again the elements of this literal melody stand more boldly\nforward and usurp the ear.  It becomes, therefore, somewhat a matter of\nconscience to select examples; and as I cannot very well ask the reader\nto help me, I shall do the next best by giving him the reason or the\nhistory of each selection.  The two first, one in prose, one in verse, I\nchose without previous analysis, simply as engaging passages that had\nlong re-echoed in my ear.\n\n‘I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and\nunbreathed, that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but slinks out\nof the race where that immortal garland is to be run for, not without\ndust and heat.’ {33}  Down to ‘virtue,’ the current S and R are both\nannounced and repeated unobtrusively, and by way of a grace-note that\nalmost inseparable group PVF is given entire. {34}  The next phrase is a\nperiod of repose, almost ugly in itself, both S and R still audible, and\nB given as the last fulfilment of PVF.  In the next four phrases, from\n‘that never’ down to ‘run for,’ the mask is thrown off, and, but for a\nslight repetition of the F and V, the whole matter turns, almost too\nobtrusively, on S and R; first S coming to the front, and then R.  In the\nconcluding phrase all these favourite letters, and even the flat A, a\ntimid preference for which is just perceptible, are discarded at a blow\nand in a bundle; and to make the break more obvious, every word ends with\na dental, and all but one with T, for which we have been cautiously\nprepared since the beginning.  The singular dignity of the first clause,\nand this hammer-stroke of the last, go far to make the charm of this\nexquisite sentence.  But it is fair to own that S and R are used a little\ncoarsely.\n\n‘In Xanady did Kubla Khan               (KĂNDL)\n   A stately pleasure dome decree,      (KDLSR)\nWhere Alph the sacred river ran,        (KĂNDLSR)\nThrough caverns measureless to man,     (KĂNLSR)\n   Down to a sunless sea.’ {35}         (NDLS)\n\n\n\nHere I have put the analysis of the main group alongside the lines; and\nthe more it is looked at, the more interesting it will seem.  But there\nare further niceties.  In lines two and four, the current S is most\ndelicately varied with Z.  In line three, the current flat A is twice\nvaried with the open A, already suggested in line two, and both times\n(‘where’ and ‘sacred’) in conjunction with the current R.  In the same\nline F and V (a harmony in themselves, even when shorn of their comrade\nP) are admirably contrasted.  And in line four there is a marked\nsubsidiary M, which again was announced in line two.  I stop from\nweariness, for more might yet be said.\n\nMy next example was recently quoted from Shakespeare as an example of the\npoet’s colour sense.  Now, I do not think literature has anything to do\nwith colour, or poets anyway the better of such a sense; and I instantly\nattacked this passage, since ‘purple’ was the word that had so pleased\nthe writer of the article, to see if there might not be some literary\nreason for its use.  It will be seen that I succeeded amply; and I am\nbound to say I think the passage exceptional in Shakespeare—exceptional,\nindeed, in literature; but it was not I who chose it.\n\n    ‘The BaRge she sat iN, like a BURNished throNe\n    BURNT oN the water: the POOP was BeateN gold,\n    PURPle the sails and so PUR* Fumèd that     * per\n    The wiNds were love-sick with them.’ {36}\n\nIt may be asked why I have put the F of ‘perfumèd’ in capitals; and I\nreply, because this change from P to F is the completion of that from B\nto P, already so adroitly carried out.  Indeed, the whole passage is a\nmonument of curious ingenuity; and it seems scarce worth while to\nindicate the subsidiary S, L, and W.  In the same article, a second\npassage from Shakespeare was quoted, once again as an example of his\ncolour sense:\n\n    ‘A mole cinque-spotted like the crimson drops\n    I’ the bottom of a cowslip.’ {37a}\n\nIt is very curious, very artificial, and not worth while to analyse at\nlength: I leave it to the reader.  But before I turn my back on\nShakespeare, I should like to quote a passage, for my own pleasure, and\nfor a very model of every technical art:\n\n    But in the wind and tempest of her frown,\n                         W. P. V.{37b} F. (st) (ow)\n    Distinction with a loud and powerful fan,\n                         W. P. F. (st) (ow) L.\n\n    Puffing at all, winnows the light away;\n                         W. P. F. L.\n    And what hath mass and matter by itself\n                         W. F. L. M. A.\n    Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.’ {38}\n                         V. L. M.\n\nFrom these delicate and choice writers I turned with some curiosity to a\nplayer of the big drum—Macaulay.  I had in hand the two-volume edition,\nand I opened at the beginning of the second volume.  Here was what I\nread:\n\n‘The violence of revolutions is generally proportioned to the degree of\nthe maladministration which has produced them.  It is therefore not\nstrange that the government of Scotland, having been during many years\ngreatly more corrupt than the government of England, should have fallen\nwith a far heavier ruin.  The movement against the last king of the house\nof Stuart was in England conservative, in Scotland destructive.  The\nEnglish complained not of the law, but of the violation of the law.’\n\nThis was plain-sailing enough; it was our old friend PVF, floated by the\nliquids in a body; but as I read on, and turned the page, and still found\nPVF with his attendant liquids, I confess my mind misgave me utterly.\nThis could be no trick of Macaulay’s; it must be the nature of the\nEnglish tongue.  In a kind of despair, I turned half-way through the\nvolume; and coming upon his lordship dealing with General Cannon, and\nfresh from Claverhouse and Killiecrankie, here, with elucidative\nspelling, was my reward:\n\n    ‘Meanwhile the disorders of Kannon’s Kamp went on inKreasing.  He\n    Kalled a Kouncil of war to Konsider what Kourse it would be advisable\n    to taKe.  But as soon as the Kouncil had met, a preliminary Kuestion\n    was raised.  The army was almost eKsKlusively a Highland army.  The\n    recent vKktory had been won eKsKlusively by Highland warriors.  Great\n    chie_f_s who had brought siKs or Se_v_en hundred _f_ighting men into\n    the _f_ield did not think it _f_air that they should be out_v_oted by\n    gentlemen _f_rom Ireland, and _f_rom the Low Kountries, who bore\n    indeed King James’s Kommission, and were Kalled Kolonels and\n    Kaptains, but who were Kolonels without regiments and Kaptains\n    without Kompanies.’\n\nA moment of FV in all this world of K’s!  It was not the English\nlanguage, then, that was an instrument of one string, but Macaulay that\nwas an incomparable dauber.\n\nIt was probably from this barbaric love of repeating the same sound,\nrather than from any design of clearness, that he acquired his irritating\nhabit of repeating words; I say the one rather than the other, because\nsuch a trick of the ear is deeper-seated and more original in man than\nany logical consideration.  Few writers, indeed, are probably conscious\nof the length to which they push this melody of letters.  One, writing\nvery diligently, and only concerned about the meaning of his words and\nthe rhythm of his phrases, was struck into amazement by the eager triumph\nwith which he cancelled one expression to substitute another.  Neither\nchanged the sense; both being mono-syllables, neither could affect the\nscansion; and it was only by looking back on what he had already written\nthat the mystery was solved: the second word contained an open A, and for\nnearly half a page he had been riding that vowel to the death.\n\nIn practice, I should add, the ear is not always so exacting; and\nordinary writers, in ordinary moments, content themselves with avoiding\nwhat is harsh, and here and there, upon a rare occasion, buttressing a\nphrase, or linking two together, with a patch of assonance or a momentary\njingle of alliteration.  To understand how constant is this preoccupation\nof good writers, even where its results are least obtrusive, it is only\nnecessary to turn to the bad.  There, indeed, you will find cacophony\nsupreme, the rattle of incongruous consonants only relieved by the\njaw-breaking hiatus, and whole phrases not to be articulated by the\npowers of man.\n\n_Conclusion_.—We may now briefly enumerate the elements of style.  We\nhave, peculiar to the prose writer, the task of keeping his phrases\nlarge, rhythmical, and pleasing to the ear, without ever allowing them to\nfall into the strictly metrical: peculiar to the versifier, the task of\ncombining and contrasting his double, treble, and quadruple pattern, feet\nand groups, logic and metre—harmonious in diversity: common to both, the\ntask of artfully combining the prime elements of language into phrases\nthat shall be musical in the mouth; the task of weaving their argument\ninto a texture of committed phrases and of rounded periods—but this\nparticularly binding in the case of prose: and, again common to both, the\ntask of choosing apt, explicit, and communicative words.  We begin to see\nnow what an intricate affair is any perfect passage; how many faculties,\nwhether of taste or pure reason, must be held upon the stretch to make\nit; and why, when it is made, it should afford us so complete a pleasure.\nFrom the arrangement of according letters, which is altogether arabesque\nand sensual, up to the architecture of the elegant and pregnant sentence,\nwhich is a vigorous act of the pure intellect, there is scarce a faculty\nin man but has been exercised.  We need not wonder, then, if perfect\nsentences are rare, and perfect pages rarer.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MORALITY OF THE PROFESSION OF LETTERS {47a}\n\n\nThe profession of letters has been lately debated in the public prints;\nand it has been debated, to put the matter mildly, from a point of view\nthat was calculated to surprise high-minded men, and bring a general\ncontempt on books and reading.  Some time ago, in particular, a lively,\npleasant, popular writer {47b} devoted an essay, lively and pleasant like\nhimself, to a very encouraging view of the profession.  We may be glad\nthat his experience is so cheering, and we may hope that all others, who\ndeserve it, shall be as handsomely rewarded; but I do not think we need\nbe at all glad to have this question, so important to the public and\nourselves, debated solely on the ground of money.  The salary in any\nbusiness under heaven is not the only, nor indeed the first, question.\nThat you should continue to exist is a matter for your own consideration;\nbut that your business should be first honest, and second useful, are\npoints in which honour and morality are concerned.  If the writer to whom\nI refer succeeds in persuading a number of young persons to adopt this\nway of life with an eye set singly on the livelihood, we must expect them\nin their works to follow profit only, and we must expect in consequence,\nif he will pardon me the epithets, a slovenly, base, untrue, and empty\nliterature.  Of that writer himself I am not speaking: he is diligent,\nclean, and pleasing; we all owe him periods of entertainment, and he has\nachieved an amiable popularity which he has adequately deserved.  But the\ntruth is, he does not, or did not when he first embraced it, regard his\nprofession from this purely mercenary side.  He went into it, I shall\nventure to say, if not with any noble design, at least in the ardour of a\nfirst love; and he enjoyed its practice long before he paused to\ncalculate the wage.  The other day an author was complimented on a piece\nof work, good in itself and exceptionally good for him, and replied, in\nterms unworthy of a commercial traveller that as the book was not briskly\nselling he did not give a copper farthing for its merit.  It must not be\nsupposed that the person to whom this answer was addressed received it as\na profession of faith; he knew, on the other hand, that it was only a\nwhiff of irritation; just as we know, when a respectable writer talks of\nliterature as a way of life, like shoemaking, but not so useful, that he\nis only debating one aspect of a question, and is still clearly conscious\nof a dozen others more important in themselves and more central to the\nmatter in hand.  But while those who treat literature in this penny-wise\nand virtue-foolish spirit are themselves truly in possession of a better\nlight, it does not follow that the treatment is decent or improving,\nwhether for themselves or others.  To treat all subjects in the highest,\nthe most honourable, and the pluckiest spirit, consistent with the fact,\nis the first duty of a writer.  If he be well paid, as I am glad to hear\nhe is, this duty becomes the more urgent, the neglect of it the more\ndisgraceful.  And perhaps there is no subject on which a man should speak\nso gravely as that industry, whatever it may be, which is the occupation\nor delight of his life; which is his tool to earn or serve with; and\nwhich, if it be unworthy, stamps himself as a mere incubus of dumb and\ngreedy bowels on the shoulders of labouring humanity.  On that subject\nalone even to force the note might lean to virtue’s side.  It is to be\nhoped that a numerous and enterprising generation of writers will follow\nand surpass the present one; but it would be better if the stream were\nstayed, and the roll of our old, honest English books were closed, than\nthat esurient book-makers should continue and debase a brave tradition,\nand lower, in their own eyes, a famous race.  Better that our serene\ntemples were deserted than filled with trafficking and juggling priests.\n\nThere are two just reasons for the choice of any way of life: the first\nis inbred taste in the chooser; the second some high utility in the\nindustry selected.  Literature, like any other art, is singularly\ninteresting to the artist; and, in a degree peculiar to itself among the\narts, it is useful to mankind.  These are the sufficient justifications\nfor any young man or woman who adopts it as the business of his life.  I\nshall not say much about the wages.  A writer can live by his writing.\nIf not so luxuriously as by other trades, then less luxuriously.  The\nnature of the work he does all day will more affect his happiness than\nthe quality of his dinner at night.  Whatever be your calling, and\nhowever much it brings you in the year, you could still, you know, get\nmore by cheating.  We all suffer ourselves to be too much concerned about\na little poverty; but such considerations should not move us in the\nchoice of that which is to be the business and justification of so great\na portion of our lives; and like the missionary, the patriot, or the\nphilosopher, we should all choose that poor and brave career in which we\ncan do the most and best for mankind.  Now Nature, faithfully followed,\nproves herself a careful mother.  A lad, for some liking to the jingle of\nwords, betakes himself to letters for his life; by-and-by, when he learns\nmore gravity, he finds that he has chosen better than he knew; that if he\nearns little, he is earning it amply; that if he receives a small wage,\nhe is in a position to do considerable services; that it is in his power,\nin some small measure, to protect the oppressed and to defend the truth.\nSo kindly is the world arranged, such great profit may arise from a small\ndegree of human reliance on oneself, and such, in particular, is the\nhappy star of this trade of writing, that it should combine pleasure and\nprofit to both parties, and be at once agreeable, like fiddling, and\nuseful, like good preaching.\n\nThis is to speak of literature at its highest; and with the four great\nelders who are still spared to our respect and admiration, with Carlyle,\nRuskin, Browning, and Tennyson before us, it would be cowardly to\nconsider it at first in any lesser aspect.  But while we cannot follow\nthese athletes, while we may none of us, perhaps, be very vigorous, very\noriginal, or very wise, I still contend that, in the humblest sort of\nliterary work, we have it in our power either to do great harm or great\ngood.  We may seek merely to please; we may seek, having no higher gift,\nmerely to gratify the idle nine days’ curiosity of our contemporaries; or\nwe may essay, however feebly, to instruct.  In each of these we shall\nhave to deal with that remarkable art of words which, because it is the\ndialect of life, comes home so easily and powerfully to the minds of men;\nand since that is so, we contribute, in each of these branches, to build\nup the sum of sentiments and appreciations which goes by the name of\nPublic Opinion or Public Feeling.  The total of a nation’s reading, in\nthese days of daily papers, greatly modifies the total of the nation’s\nspeech; and the speech and reading, taken together, form the efficient\neducational medium of youth.  A good man or woman may keep a youth some\nlittle while in clearer air; but the contemporary atmosphere is\nall-powerful in the end on the average of mediocre characters.  The\ncopious Corinthian baseness of the American reporter or the Parisian\n_chroniquear_, both so lightly readable, must exercise an incalculable\ninfluence for ill; they touch upon all subjects, and on all with the same\nungenerous hand; they begin the consideration of all, in young and\nunprepared minds, in an unworthy spirit; on all, they supply some\npungency for dull people to quote.  The mere body of this ugly matter\noverwhelms the rare utterances of good men; the sneering, the selfish,\nand the cowardly are scattered in broad sheets on every table, while the\nantidote, in small volumes, lies unread upon the shelf.  I have spoken of\nthe American and the French, not because they are so much baser, but so\nmuch more readable, than the English; their evil is done more\neffectively, in America for the masses, in French for the few that care\nto read; but with us as with them, the duties of literature are daily\nneglected, truth daily perverted and suppressed, and grave subjects daily\ndegraded in the treatment.  The journalist is not reckoned an important\nofficer; yet judge of the good he might do, the harm he does; judge of it\nby one instance only: that when we find two journals on the reverse sides\nof politics each, on the same day, openly garbling a piece of news for\nthe interest of its own party, we smile at the discovery (no discovery\nnow!) as over a good joke and pardonable stratagem.  Lying so open is\nscarce lying, it is true; but one of the things that we profess to teach\nour young is a respect for truth; and I cannot think this piece of\neducation will be crowned with any great success, so long as some of us\npractise and the rest openly approve of public falsehood.\n\nThere are two duties incumbent upon any man who enters on the business of\nwriting: truth to the fact and a good spirit in the treatment.  In every\ndepartment of literature, though so low as hardly to deserve the name,\ntruth to the fact is of importance to the education and comfort of\nmankind, and so hard to preserve, that the faithful trying to do so will\nlend some dignity to the man who tries it.  Our judgments are based upon\ntwo things: first, upon the original preferences of our soul; but,\nsecond, upon the mass of testimony to the nature of God, man, and the\nuniverse which reaches us, in divers manners, from without.  For the most\npart these divers manners are reducible to one, all that we learn of past\ntimes and much that we learn of our own reaching us through the medium of\nbooks or papers, and even he who cannot read learning from the same\nsource at second-hand and by the report of him who can.  Thus the sum of\nthe contemporary knowledge or ignorance of good and evil is, in large\nmeasure, the handiwork of those who write.  Those who write have to see\nthat each man’s knowledge is, as near as they can make it, answerable to\nthe facts of life; that he shall not suppose himself an angel or a\nmonster; nor take this world for a hell; nor be suffered to imagine that\nall rights are concentred in his own caste or country, or all veracities\nin his own parochial creed.  Each man should learn what is within him,\nthat he may strive to mend; he must be taught what is without him, that\nhe may be kind to others.  It can never be wrong to tell him the truth;\nfor, in his disputable state, weaving as he goes his theory of life,\nsteering himself, cheering or reproving others, all facts are of the\nfirst importance to his conduct; and even if a fact shall discourage or\ncorrupt him, it is still best that he should know it; for it is in this\nworld as it is, and not in a world made easy by educational suppressions,\nthat he must win his way to shame or glory.  In one word, it must always\nbe foul to tell what is false; and it can never be safe to suppress what\nis true.  The very fact that you omit may be the fact which somebody was\nwanting, for one man’s meat is another man’s poison, and I have known a\nperson who was cheered by the perusal of _Candide_.  Every fact is a part\nof that great puzzle we must set together; and none that comes directly\nin a writer’s path but has some nice relations, unperceivable by him, to\nthe totality and bearing of the subject under hand.  Yet there are\ncertain classes of fact eternally more necessary than others, and it is\nwith these that literature must first bestir itself.  They are not hard\nto distinguish, nature once more easily leading us; for the necessary,\nbecause the efficacious, facts are those which are most interesting to\nthe natural mind of man.  Those which are coloured, picturesque, human,\nand rooted in morality, and those, on the other hand, which are clear,\nindisputable, and a part of science, are alone vital in importance,\nseizing by their interest, or useful to communicate.  So far as the\nwriter merely narrates, he should principally tell of these.  He should\ntell of the kind and wholesome and beautiful elements of our life; he\nshould tell unsparingly of the evil and sorrow of the present, to move us\nwith instances: he should tell of wise and good people in the past, to\nexcite us by example; and of these he should tell soberly and truthfully,\nnot glossing faults, that we may neither grow discouraged with ourselves\nnor exacting to our neighbours.  So the body of contemporary literature,\nephemeral and feeble in itself, touches in the minds of men the springs\nof thought and kindness, and supports them (for those who will go at all\nare easily supported) on their way to what is true and right.  And if, in\nany degree, it does so now, how much more might it do so if the writers\nchose!  There is not a life in all the records of the past but, properly\nstudied, might lend a hint and a help to some contemporary.  There is not\na juncture in to-day’s affairs but some useful word may yet be said of\nit.  Even the reporter has an office, and, with clear eyes and honest\nlanguage, may unveil injustices and point the way to progress.  And for a\nlast word: in all narration there is only one way to be clever, and that\nis to be exact.  To be vivid is a secondary quality which must presuppose\nthe first; for vividly to convey a wrong impression is only to make\nfailure conspicuous.\n\nBut a fact may be viewed on many sides; it may be chronicled with rage,\ntears, laughter, indifference, or admiration, and by each of these the\nstory will be transformed to something else.  The newspapers that told of\nthe return of our representatives from Berlin, even if they had not\ndiffered as to the facts, would have sufficiently differed by their\nspirits; so that the one description would have been a second ovation,\nand the other a prolonged insult.  The subject makes but a trifling part\nof any piece of literature, and the view of the writer is itself a fact\nmore important because less disputable than the others.  Now this spirit\nin which a subject is regarded, important in all kinds of literary work,\nbecomes all-important in works of fiction, meditation, or rhapsody; for\nthere it not only colours but itself chooses the facts; not only modifies\nbut shapes the work.  And hence, over the far larger proportion of the\nfield of literature, the health or disease of the writer’s mind or\nmomentary humour forms not only the leading feature of his work, but is,\nat bottom, the only thing he can communicate to others.  In all works of\nart, widely speaking, it is first of all the author’s attitude that is\nnarrated, though in the attitude there be implied a whole experience and\na theory of life.  An author who has begged the question and reposes in\nsome narrow faith cannot, if he would, express the whole or even many of\nthe sides of this various existence; for, his own life being maim, some\nof them are not admitted in his theory, and were only dimly and\nunwillingly recognised in his experience.  Hence the smallness, the\ntriteness, and the inhumanity in works of merely sectarian religion; and\nhence we find equal although unsimilar limitation in works inspired by\nthe spirit of the flesh or the despicable taste for high society.  So\nthat the first duty of any man who is to write is intellectual.\nDesignedly or not, he has so far set himself up for a leader of the minds\nof men; and he must see that his own mind is kept supple, charitable, and\nbright.  Everything but prejudice should find a voice through him; he\nshould see the good in all things; where he has even a fear that he does\nnot wholly understand, there he should be wholly silent; and he should\nrecognise from the first that he has only one tool in his workshop, and\nthat tool is sympathy. {64}\n\nThe second duty, far harder to define, is moral.  There are a thousand\ndifferent humours in the mind, and about each of them, when it is\nuppermost, some literature tends to be deposited.  Is this to be allowed?\nNot certainly in every case, and yet perhaps in more than rigourists\nwould fancy.  It were to be desired that all literary work, and chiefly\nworks of art, issued from sound, human, healthy, and potent impulses,\nwhether grave or laughing, humorous, romantic, or religious.\n\nYet it cannot be denied that some valuable books are partially insane;\nsome, mostly religious, partially inhuman; and very many tainted with\nmorbidity and impotence.  We do not loathe a masterpiece although we gird\nagainst its blemishes.  We are not, above all, to look for faults, but\nmerits.  There is no book perfect, even in design; but there are many\nthat will delight, improve, or encourage the reader.  On the one hand,\nthe Hebrew psalms are the only religious poetry on earth; yet they\ncontain sallies that savour rankly of the man of blood.  On the other\nhand, Alfred de Musset had a poisoned and a contorted nature; I am only\nquoting that generous and frivolous giant, old Dumas, when I accuse him\nof a bad heart; yet, when the impulse under which he wrote was purely\ncreative, he could give us works like _Carmosine_ or _Fantasio_, in which\nthe last note of the romantic comedy seems to have been found again to\ntouch and please us.  When Flaubert wrote _Madame Bovary_, I believe he\nthought chiefly of a somewhat morbid realism; and behold! the book turned\nin his hands into a masterpiece of appalling morality.  But the truth is,\nwhen books are conceived under a great stress, with a soul of ninefold\npower, nine times heated and electrified by effort, the conditions of our\nbeing are seized with such an ample grasp, that, even should the main\ndesign be trivial or base, some truth and beauty cannot fail to be\nexpressed.  Out of the strong comes forth sweetness; but an ill thing\npoorly done is an ill thing top and bottom.  And so this can be no\nencouragement to knock-kneed, feeble-wristed scribes, who must take their\nbusiness conscientiously or be ashamed to practise it.\n\nMan is imperfect; yet, in his literature, he must express himself and his\nown views and preferences; for to do anything else is to do a far more\nperilous thing than to risk being immoral: it is to be sure of being\nuntrue.  To ape a sentiment, even a good one, is to travesty a sentiment;\nthat will not be helpful.  To conceal a sentiment, if you are sure you\nhold it, is to take a liberty with truth.  There is probably no point of\nview possible to a sane man but contains some truth and, in the true\nconnection, might be profitable to the race.  I am not afraid of the\ntruth, if any one could tell it me, but I am afraid of parts of it\nimpertinently uttered.  There is a time to dance and a time to mourn; to\nbe harsh as well as to be sentimental; to be ascetic as well as to\nglorify the appetites; and if a man were to combine all these extremes\ninto his work, each in its place and proportion, that work would be the\nworld’s masterpiece of morality as well as of art.  Partiality is\nimmorality; for any book is wrong that gives a misleading picture of the\nworld and life.  The trouble is that the weakling must be partial; the\nwork of one proving dank and depressing; of another, cheap and vulgar; of\na third, epileptically sensual; of a fourth, sourly ascetic.  In\nliterature as in conduct, you can never hope to do exactly right.  All\nyou can do is to make as sure as possible; and for that there is but one\nrule.  Nothing should be done in a hurry that can be done slowly.  It is\nno use to write a book and put it by for nine or even ninety years; for\nin the writing you will have partly convinced yourself; the delay must\nprecede any beginning; and if you meditate a work of art, you should\nfirst long roll the subject under the tongue to make sure you like the\nflavour, before you brew a volume that shall taste of it from end to end;\nor if you propose to enter on the field of controversy, you should first\nhave thought upon the question under all conditions, in health as well as\nin sickness, in sorrow as well as in joy.  It is this nearness of\nexamination necessary for any true and kind writing, that makes the\npractice of the art a prolonged and noble education for the writer.\n\nThere is plenty to do, plenty to say, or to say over again, in the\nmeantime.  Any literary work which conveys faithful facts or pleasing\nimpressions is a service to the public.  It is even a service to be\nthankfully proud of having rendered.  The slightest novels are a blessing\nto those in distress, not chloroform itself a greater.  Our fine old\nsea-captain’s life was justified when Carlyle soothed his mind with _The\nKing’s Own_ or _Newton Forster_.  To please is to serve; and so far from\nits being difficult to instruct while you amuse, it is difficult to do\nthe one thoroughly without the other.  Some part of the writer or his\nlife will crop out in even a vapid book; and to read a novel that was\nconceived with any force is to multiply experience and to exercise the\nsympathies.\n\nEvery article, every piece of verse, every essay, every _entre-filet_, is\ndestined to pass, however swiftly, through the minds of some portion of\nthe public, and to colour, however transiently, their thoughts.  When any\nsubject falls to be discussed, some scribbler on a paper has the\ninvaluable opportunity of beginning its discussion in a dignified and\nhuman spirit; and if there were enough who did so in our public press,\nneither the public nor the Parliament would find it in their minds to\ndrop to meaner thoughts.  The writer has the chance to stumble, by the\nway, on something pleasing, something interesting, something encouraging,\nwere it only to a single reader.  He will be unfortunate, indeed, if he\nsuit no one.  He has the chance, besides, to stumble on something that a\ndull person shall be able to comprehend; and for a dull person to have\nread anything and, for that once, comprehended it, makes a marking epoch\nin his education.\n\nHere, then, is work worth doing and worth trying to do well.  And so, if\nI were minded to welcome any great accession to our trade, it should not\nbe from any reason of a higher wage, but because it was a trade which was\nuseful in a very great and in a very high degree; which every honest\ntradesman could make more serviceable to mankind in his single strength;\nwhich was difficult to do well and possible to do better every year;\nwhich called for scrupulous thought on the part of all who practised it,\nand hence became a perpetual education to their nobler natures; and\nwhich, pay it as you please, in the large majority of the best cases will\nstill be underpaid.  For surely, at this time of day in the nineteenth\ncentury, there is nothing that an honest man should fear more timorously\nthan getting and spending more than he deserves.\n\n\n\n\nBOOKS WHICH HAVE INFLUENCED ME {75a}\n\n\nThe Editor {75b} has somewhat insidiously laid a trap for his\ncorrespondents, the question put appearing at first so innocent, truly\ncutting so deep.  It is not, indeed, until after some reconnaissance and\nreview that the writer awakes to find himself engaged upon something in\nthe nature of autobiography, or, perhaps worse, upon a chapter in the\nlife of that little, beautiful brother whom we once all had, and whom we\nhave all lost and mourned, the man we ought to have been, the man we\nhoped to be.  But when word has been passed (even to an editor), it\nshould, if possible, be kept; and if sometimes I am wise and say too\nlittle, and sometimes weak and say too much, the blame must lie at the\ndoor of the person who entrapped me.\n\nThe most influential books, and the truest in their influence, are works\nof fiction.  They do not pin the reader to a dogma, which he must\nafterwards discover to be inexact; they do not teach him a lesson, which\nhe must afterwards unlearn.  They repeat, they rearrange, they clarify\nthe lessons of life; they disengage us from ourselves, they constrain us\nto the acquaintance of others; and they show us the web of experience,\nnot as we can see it for ourselves, but with a singular change—that\nmonstrous, consuming _ego_ of ours being, for the nonce, struck out.  To\nbe so, they must be reasonably true to the human comedy; and any work\nthat is so serves the turn of instruction.  But the course of our\neducation is answered best by those poems and romances where we breathe a\nmagnanimous atmosphere of thought and meet generous and pious characters.\nShakespeare has served me best.  Few living friends have had upon me an\ninfluence so strong for good as Hamlet or Rosalind.  The last character,\nalready well beloved in the reading, I had the good fortune to see, I\nmust think, in an impressionable hour, played by Mrs. Scott Siddons.\nNothing has ever more moved, more delighted, more refreshed me; nor has\nthe influence quite passed away.  Kent’s brief speech over the dying Lear\nhad a great effect upon my mind, and was the burthen of my reflections\nfor long, so profoundly, so touchingly generous did it appear in sense,\nso overpowering in expression.  Perhaps my dearest and best friend\noutside of Shakespeare is D’Artagnan—the elderly D’Artagnan of the\n_Vicomte de Bragelonne_.  I know not a more human soul, nor, in his way,\na finer; I shall be very sorry for the man who is so much of a pedant in\nmorals that he cannot learn from the Captain of Musketeers.  Lastly, I\nmust name the _Pilgrim’s Progress_, a book that breathes of every\nbeautiful and valuable emotion.\n\nBut of works of art little can be said; their influence is profound and\nsilent, like the influence of nature; they mould by contact; we drink\nthem up like water, and are bettered, yet know not how.  It is in books\nmore specifically didactic that we can follow out the effect, and\ndistinguish and weigh and compare.  A book which has been very\ninfluential upon me fell early into my hands, and so may stand first,\nthough I think its influence was only sensible later on, and perhaps\nstill keeps growing, for it is a book not easily outlived: the _Essais_\nof Montaigne.  That temperate and genial picture of life is a great gift\nto place in the hands of persons of to-day; they will find in these\nsmiling pages a magazine of heroism and wisdom, all of an antique strain;\nthey will have their ‘linen decencies’ and excited orthodoxies fluttered,\nand will (if they have any gift of reading) perceive that these have not\nbeen fluttered without some excuse and ground of reason; and (again if\nthey have any gift of reading) they will end by seeing that this old\ngentleman was in a dozen ways a finer fellow, and held in a dozen ways a\nnobler view of life, than they or their contemporaries.\n\nThe next book, in order of time, to influence me, was the New Testament,\nand in particular the Gospel according to St. Matthew.  I believe it\nwould startle and move any one if they could make a certain effort of\nimagination and read it freshly like a book, not droningly and dully like\na portion of the Bible.  Any one would then be able to see in it those\ntruths which we are all courteously supposed to know and all modestly\nrefrain from applying.  But upon this subject it is perhaps better to be\nsilent.\n\nI come next to Whitman’s _Leaves of Grass_, a book of singular service, a\nbook which tumbled the world upside down for me, blew into space a\nthousand cobwebs of genteel and ethical illusion, and, having thus shaken\nmy tabernacle of lies, set me back again upon a strong foundation of all\nthe original and manly virtues.  But it is, once more, only a book for\nthose who have the gift of reading.  I will be very frank—I believe it is\nso with all good books except, perhaps, fiction.  The average man lives,\nand must live, so wholly in convention, that gunpowder charges of the\ntruth are more apt to discompose than to invigorate his creed.  Either he\ncries out upon blasphemy and indecency, and crouches the closer round\nthat little idol of part-truths and part-conveniences which is the\ncontemporary deity, or he is convinced by what is new, forgets what is\nold, and becomes truly blasphemous and indecent himself.  New truth is\nonly useful to supplement the old; rough truth is only wanted to expand,\nnot to destroy, our civil and often elegant conventions.  He who cannot\njudge had better stick to fiction and the daily papers.  There he will\nget little harm, and, in the first at least, some good.\n\nClose upon the back of my discovery of Whitman, I came under the\ninfluence of Herbert Spencer.  No more persuasive rabbi exists, and few\nbetter.  How much of his vast structure will bear the touch of time, how\nmuch is clay and how much brass, it were too curious to inquire.  But his\nwords, if dry, are always manly and honest; there dwells in his pages a\nspirit of highly abstract joy, plucked naked like an algebraic symbol but\nstill joyful; and the reader will find there a _caput mortuum_ of piety,\nwith little indeed of its loveliness, but with most of its essentials;\nand these two qualities make him a wholesome, as his intellectual vigour\nmakes him a bracing, writer.  I should be much of a hound if I lost my\ngratitude to Herbert Spencer.\n\n_Goethe’s Life_, by Lewes, had a great importance for me when it first\nfell into my hands—a strange instance of the partiality of man’s good and\nman’s evil.  I know no one whom I less admire than Goethe; he seems a\nvery epitome of the sins of genius, breaking open the doors of private\nlife, and wantonly wounding friends, in that crowning offence of\n_Werther_, and in his own character a mere pen-and-ink Napoleon,\nconscious of the rights and duties of superior talents as a Spanish\ninquisitor was conscious of the rights and duties of his office.  And yet\nin his fine devotion to his art, in his honest and serviceable friendship\nfor Schiller, what lessons are contained!  Biography, usually so false to\nits office, does here for once perform for us some of the work of\nfiction, reminding us, that is, of the truly mingled tissue of man’s\nnature, and how huge faults and shining virtues cohabit and persevere in\nthe same character.  History serves us well to this effect, but in the\noriginals, not in the pages of the popular epitomiser, who is bound, by\nthe very nature of his task, to make us feel the difference of epochs\ninstead of the essential identity of man, and even in the originals only\nto those who can recognise their own human virtues and defects in strange\nforms, often inverted and under strange names, often interchanged.\nMartial is a poet of no good repute, and it gives a man new thoughts to\nread his works dispassionately, and find in this unseemly jester’s\nserious passages the image of a kind, wise, and self-respecting\ngentleman.  It is customary, I suppose, in reading Martial, to leave out\nthese pleasant verses; I never heard of them, at least, until I found\nthem for myself; and this partiality is one among a thousand things that\nhelp to build up our distorted and hysterical conception of the great\nRoman Empire.\n\nThis brings us by a natural transition to a very noble book—the\n_Meditations_ of Marcus Aurelius.  The dispassionate gravity, the noble\nforgetfulness of self, the tenderness of others, that are there expressed\nand were practised on so great a scale in the life of its writer, make\nthis book a book quite by itself.  No one can read it and not be moved.\nYet it scarcely or rarely appeals to the feelings—those very mobile,\nthose not very trusty parts of man.  Its address lies further back: its\nlesson comes more deeply home; when you have read, you carry away with\nyou a memory of the man himself; it is as though you had touched a loyal\nhand, looked into brave eyes, and made a noble friend; there is another\nbond on you thenceforward, binding you to life and to the love of virtue.\n\nWordsworth should perhaps come next.  Every one has been influenced by\nWordsworth, and it is hard to tell precisely how.  A certain innocence, a\nrugged austerity of joy, a sight of the stars, ‘the silence that is in\nthe lonely hills,’ something of the cold thrill of dawn, cling to his\nwork and give it a particular address to what is best in us.  I do not\nknow that you learn a lesson; you need not—Mill did not—agree with any\none of his beliefs; and yet the spell is cast.  Such are the best\nteachers; a dogma learned is only a new error—the old one was perhaps as\ngood; but a spirit communicated is a perpetual possession.  These best\nteachers climb beyond teaching to the plane of art; it is themselves, and\nwhat is best in themselves, that they communicate.\n\nI should never forgive myself if I forgot _The Egoist_.  It is art, if\nyou like, but it belongs purely to didactic art, and from all the novels\nI have read (and I have read thousands) stands in a place by itself.\nHere is a Nathan for the modern David; here is a book to send the blood\ninto men’s faces.  Satire, the angry picture of human faults, is not\ngreat art; we can all be angry with our neighbour; what we want is to be\nshown, not his defects, of which we are too conscious, but his merits, to\nwhich we are too blind.  And _The Egoist_ is a satire; so much must be\nallowed; but it is a satire of a singular quality, which tells you\nnothing of that obvious mote, which is engaged from first to last with\nthat invisible beam.  It is yourself that is hunted down; these are your\nown faults that are dragged into the day and numbered, with lingering\nrelish, with cruel cunning and precision.  A young friend of Mr.\nMeredith’s (as I have the story) came to him in an agony.  ‘This is too\nbad of you,’ he cried.  ‘Willoughby is me!’  ‘No, my dear fellow,’ said\nthe author; ‘he is all of us.’\n\nI have read _The Egoist_ five or six times myself, and I mean to read it\nagain; for I am like the young friend of the anecdote—I think Willoughby\nan unmanly but a very serviceable exposure of myself.\n\nI suppose, when I am done, I shall find that I have forgotten much that\nwas most influential, as I see already I have forgotten Thoreau, and\nHazlitt, whose paper ‘On the Spirit of Obligations’ was a turning-point\nin my life, and Penn, whose little book of aphorisms had a brief but\nstrong effect on me, and Mitford’s _Tales of Old Japan_, wherein I\nlearned for the first time the proper attitude of any rational man to his\ncountry’s laws—a secret found, and kept, in the Asiatic islands.  That I\nshould commemorate all is more than I can hope or the Editor could ask.\nIt will be more to the point, after having said so much upon improving\nbooks, to say a word or two about the improvable reader.  The gift of\nreading, as I have called it, is not very common, nor very generally\nunderstood.  It consists, first of all, in a vast intellectual\nendowment—a free grace, I find I must call it—by which a man rises to\nunderstand that he is not punctually right, nor those from whom he\ndiffers absolutely wrong.  He may hold dogmas; he may hold them\npassionately; and he may know that others hold them but coldly, or hold\nthem differently, or hold them not at all.  Well, if he has the gift of\nreading, these others will be full of meat for him.  They will see the\nother side of propositions and the other side of virtues.  He need not\nchange his dogma for that, but he may change his reading of that dogma,\nand he must supplement and correct his deductions from it.  A human\ntruth, which is always very much a lie, hides as much of life as it\ndisplays.  It is men who hold another truth, or, as it seems to us,\nperhaps, a dangerous lie, who can extend our restricted field of\nknowledge, and rouse our drowsy consciences.  Something that seems quite\nnew, or that seems insolently false or very dangerous, is the test of a\nreader.  If he tries to see what it means, what truth excuses it, he has\nthe gift, and let him read.  If he is merely hurt, or offended, or\nexclaims upon his author’s folly, he had better take to the daily papers;\nhe will never be a reader.\n\nAnd here, with the aptest illustrative force, after I have laid down my\npart-truth, I must step in with its opposite.  For, after all, we are\nvessels of a very limited content.  Not all men can read all books; it is\nonly in a chosen few that any man will find his appointed food; and the\nfittest lessons are the most palatable, and make themselves welcome to\nthe mind.  A writer learns this early, and it is his chief support; he\ngoes on unafraid, laying down the law; and he is sure at heart that most\nof what he says is demonstrably false, and much of a mingled strain, and\nsome hurtful, and very little good for service; but he is sure besides\nthat when his words fall into the hands of any genuine reader, they will\nbe weighed and winnowed, and only that which suits will be assimilated;\nand when they fall into the hands of one who cannot intelligently read,\nthey come there quite silent and inarticulate, falling upon deaf ears,\nand his secret is kept as if he had not written.\n\n\n\n\nA NOTE ON REALISM {93}\n\n\nStyle is the invariable mark of any master; and for the student who does\nnot aspire so high as to be numbered with the giants, it is still the one\nquality in which he may improve himself at will.  Passion, wisdom,\ncreative force, the power of mystery or colour, are allotted in the hour\nof birth, and can be neither learned nor simulated.  But the just and\ndexterous use of what qualities we have, the proportion of one part to\nanother and to the whole, the elision of the useless, the accentuation of\nthe important, and the preservation of a uniform character from end to\nend—these, which taken together constitute technical perfection, are to\nsome degree within the reach of industry and intellectual courage.  What\nto put in and what to leave out; whether some particular fact be\norganically necessary or purely ornamental; whether, if it be purely\nornamental, it may not weaken or obscure the general design; and finally,\nwhether, if we decide to use it, we should do so grossly and notably, or\nin some conventional disguise: are questions of plastic style continually\nrearising.  And the sphinx that patrols the highways of executive art has\nno more unanswerable riddle to propound.\n\nIn literature (from which I must draw my instances) the great change of\nthe past century has been effected by the admission of detail.  It was\ninaugurated by the romantic Scott; and at length, by the semi-romantic\nBalzac and his more or less wholly unromantic followers, bound like a\nduty on the novelist.  For some time it signified and expressed a more\nample contemplation of the conditions of man’s life; but it has recently\n(at least in France) fallen into a merely technical and decorative stage,\nwhich it is, perhaps, still too harsh to call survival.  With a movement\nof alarm, the wiser or more timid begin to fall a little back from these\nextremities; they begin to aspire after a more naked, narrative\narticulation; after the succinct, the dignified, and the poetic; and as a\nmeans to this, after a general lightening of this baggage of detail.\nAfter Scott we beheld the starveling story—once, in the hands of\nVoltaire, as abstract as a parable—begin to be pampered upon facts.  The\nintroduction of these details developed a particular ability of hand; and\nthat ability, childishly indulged, has led to the works that now amaze us\non a railway journey.  A man of the unquestionable force of M. Zola\nspends himself on technical successes.  To afford a popular flavour and\nattract the mob, he adds a steady current of what I may be allowed to\ncall the rancid.  That is exciting to the moralist; but what more\nparticularly interests the artist is this tendency of the extreme of\ndetail, when followed as a principle, to degenerate into mere\n_feux-de-joie_ of literary tricking.  The other day even M. Daudet was to\nbe heard babbling of audible colours and visible sounds.\n\nThis odd suicide of one branch of the realists may serve to remind us of\nthe fact which underlies a very dusty conflict of the critics.  All\nrepresentative art, which can be said to live, is both realistic and\nideal; and the realism about which we quarrel is a matter purely of\nexternals.  It is no especial cultus of nature and veracity, but a mere\nwhim of veering fashion, that has made us turn our back upon the larger,\nmore various, and more romantic art of yore.  A photographic exactitude\nin dialogue is now the exclusive fashion; but even in the ablest hands it\ntells us no more—I think it even tells us less—than Molière, wielding his\nartificial medium, has told to us and to all time of Alceste or Orgon,\nDorine or Chrysale.  The historical novel is forgotten.  Yet truth to the\nconditions of man’s nature and the conditions of man’s life, the truth of\nliterary art, is free of the ages.  It may be told us in a carpet comedy,\nin a novel of adventure, or a fairy tale.  The scene may be pitched in\nLondon, on the sea-coast of Bohemia, or away on the mountains of Beulah.\nAnd by an odd and luminous accident, if there is any page of literature\ncalculated to awake the envy of M. Zola, it must be that _Troilus and\nCressida_ which Shakespeare, in a spasm of unmanly anger with the world,\ngrafted on the heroic story of the siege of Troy.\n\nThis question of realism, let it then be clearly understood, regards not\nin the least degree the fundamental truth, but only the technical method,\nof a work of art.  Be as ideal or as abstract as you please, you will be\nnone the less veracious; but if you be weak, you run the risk of being\ntedious and inexpressive; and if you be very strong and honest, you may\nchance upon a masterpiece.\n\nA work of art is first cloudily conceived in the mind; during the period\nof gestation it stands more clearly forward from these swaddling mists,\nputs on expressive lineaments, and becomes at length that most faultless,\nbut also, alas! that incommunicable product of the human mind, a\nperfected design.  On the approach to execution all is changed.  The\nartist must now step down, don his working clothes, and become the\nartisan.  He now resolutely commits his airy conception, his delicate\nAriel, to the touch of matter; he must decide, almost in a breath, the\nscale, the style, the spirit, and the particularity of execution of his\nwhole design.\n\nThe engendering idea of some works is stylistic; a technical\npreoccupation stands them instead of some robuster principle of life.\nAnd with these the execution is but play; for the stylistic problem is\nresolved beforehand, and all large originality of treatment wilfully\nforegone.  Such are the verses, intricately designed, which we have\nlearnt to admire, with a certain smiling admiration, at the hands of Mr.\nLang and Mr. Dobson; such, too, are those canvases where dexterity or\neven breadth of plastic style takes the place of pictorial nobility of\ndesign.  So, it may be remarked, it was easier to begin to write _Esmond_\nthan _Vanity Fair_, since, in the first, the style was dictated by the\nnature of the plan; and Thackeray, a man probably of some indolence of\nmind, enjoyed and got good profit of this economy of effort.  But the\ncase is exceptional.  Usually in all works of art that have been\nconceived from within outwards, and generously nourished from the\nauthor’s mind, the moment in which he begins to execute is one of extreme\nperplexity and strain.  Artists of indifferent energy and an imperfect\ndevotion to their own ideal make this ungrateful effort once for all;\nand, having formed a style, adhere to it through life.  But those of a\nhigher order cannot rest content with a process which, as they continue\nto employ it, must infallibly degenerate towards the academic and the\ncut-and-dried.  Every fresh work in which they embark is the signal for a\nfresh engagement of the whole forces of their mind; and the changing\nviews which accompany the growth of their experience are marked by still\nmore sweeping alterations in the manner of their art.  So that criticism\nloves to dwell upon and distinguish the varying periods of a Raphael, a\nShakespeare, or a Beethoven.\n\nIt is, then, first of all, at this initial and decisive moment when\nexecution is begun, and thenceforth only in a less degree, that the ideal\nand the real do indeed, like good and evil angels, contend for the\ndirection of the work.  Marble, paint, and language, the pen, the needle,\nand the brush, all have their grossnesses, their ineffable impotences,\ntheir hours, if I may so express myself, of insubordination.  It is the\nwork and it is a great part of the delight of any artist to contend with\nthese unruly tools, and now by brute energy, now by witty expedient, to\ndrive and coax them to effect his will.  Given these means, so laughably\ninadequate, and given the interest, the intensity, and the multiplicity\nof the actual sensation whose effect he is to render with their aid, the\nartist has one main and necessary resource which he must, in every case\nand upon any theory, employ.  He must, that is, suppress much and omit\nmore.  He must omit what is tedious or irrelevant, and suppress what is\ntedious and necessary.  But such facts as, in regard to the main design,\nsubserve a variety of purposes, he will perforce and eagerly retain.  And\nit is the mark of the very highest order of creative art to be woven\nexclusively of such.  There, any fact that is registered is contrived a\ndouble or a treble debt to pay, and is at once an ornament in its place,\nand a pillar in the main design.  Nothing would find room in such a\npicture that did not serve, at once, to complete the composition, to\naccentuate the scheme of colour, to distinguish the planes of distance,\nand to strike the note of the selected sentiment; nothing would be\nallowed in such a story that did not, at the same time, expedite the\nprogress of the fable, build up the characters, and strike home the moral\nor the philosophical design.  But this is unattainable.  As a rule, so\nfar from building the fabric of our works exclusively with these, we are\nthrown into a rapture if we think we can muster a dozen or a score of\nthem, to be the plums of our confection.  And hence, in order that the\ncanvas may be filled or the story proceed from point to point, other\ndetails must be admitted.  They must be admitted, alas! upon a doubtful\ntitle; many without marriage robes.  Thus any work of art, as it proceeds\ntowards completion, too often—I had almost written always—loses in force\nand poignancy of main design.  Our little air is swamped and dwarfed\namong hardly relevant orchestration; our little passionate story drowns\nin a deep sea of descriptive eloquence or slipshod talk.\n\nBut again, we are rather more tempted to admit those particulars which we\nknow we can describe; and hence those most of all which, having been\ndescribed very often, have grown to be conventionally treated in the\npractice of our art.  These we choose, as the mason chooses the acanthus\nto adorn his capital, because they come naturally to the accustomed hand.\nThe old stock incidents and accessories, tricks of workmanship and\nschemes of composition (all being admirably good, or they would long have\nbeen forgotten) haunt and tempt our fancy, offer us ready-made but not\nperfectly appropriate solutions for any problem that arises, and wean us\nfrom the study of nature and the uncompromising practice of art.  To\nstruggle, to face nature, to find fresh solutions, and give expression to\nfacts which have not yet been adequately or not yet elegantly expressed,\nis to run a little upon the danger of extreme self-love.  Difficulty sets\na high price upon achievement; and the artist may easily fall into the\nerror of the French naturalists, and consider any fact as welcome to\nadmission if it be the ground of brilliant handiwork; or, again, into the\nerror of the modern landscape-painter, who is apt to think that\ndifficulty overcome and science well displayed can take the place of what\nis, after all, the one excuse and breath of art—charm.  A little further,\nand he will regard charm in the light of an unworthy sacrifice to\nprettiness, and the omission of a tedious passage as an infidelity to\nart.\n\nWe have now the matter of this difference before us.  The idealist, his\neye singly fixed upon the greater outlines, loves rather to fill up the\ninterval with detail of the conventional order, briefly touched, soberly\nsuppressed in tone, courting neglect.  But the realist, with a fine\nintemperance, will not suffer the presence of anything so dead as a\nconvention; he shall have all fiery, all hot-pressed from nature, all\ncharactered and notable, seizing the eye.  The style that befits either\nof these extremes, once chosen, brings with it its necessary disabilities\nand dangers.  The immediate danger of the realist is to sacrifice the\nbeauty and significance of the whole to local dexterity, or, in the\ninsane pursuit of completion, to immolate his readers under facts; but he\ncomes in the last resort, and as his energy declines, to discard all\ndesign, abjure all choice, and, with scientific thoroughness, steadily to\ncommunicate matter which is not worth learning.  The danger of the\nidealist is, of course, to become merely null and lose all grip of fact,\nparticularity, or passion.\n\nWe talk of bad and good.  Everything, indeed, is good which is conceived\nwith honesty and executed with communicative ardour.  But though on\nneither side is dogmatism fitting, and though in every case the artist\nmust decide for himself, and decide afresh and yet afresh for each\nsucceeding work and new creation; yet one thing may be generally said,\nthat we of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, breathing as we do\nthe intellectual atmosphere of our age, are more apt to err upon the side\nof realism than to sin in quest of the ideal.  Upon that theory it may be\nwell to watch and correct our own decisions, always holding back the hand\nfrom the least appearance of irrelevant dexterity, and resolutely fixed\nto begin no work that is not philosophical, passionate, dignified,\nhappily mirthful, or, at the last and least, romantic in design.\n\n\n\n\nMY FIRST BOOK: ‘TREASURE ISLAND’ {111}\n\n\nIt was far indeed from being my first book, for I am not a novelist\nalone.  But I am well aware that my paymaster, the Great Public, regards\nwhat else I have written with indifference, if not aversion; if it call\nupon me at all, it calls on me in the familiar and indelible character;\nand when I am asked to talk of my first book, no question in the world\nbut what is meant is my first novel.\n\nSooner or later, somehow, anyhow, I was bound to write a novel.  It seems\nvain to ask why.  Men are born with various manias: from my earliest\nchildhood, it was mine to make a plaything of imaginary series of events;\nand as soon as I was able to write, I became a good friend to the\npaper-makers.  Reams upon reams must have gone to the making of\n‘Rathillet,’ ‘The Pentland Rising,’ {112} ‘The King’s Pardon’ (otherwise\n‘Park Whitehead’), ‘Edward Daven,’ ‘A Country Dance,’ and ‘A Vendetta in\nthe West’; and it is consolatory to remember that these reams are now all\nashes, and have been received again into the soil.  I have named but a\nfew of my ill-fated efforts, only such indeed as came to a fair bulk ere\nthey were desisted from; and even so they cover a long vista of years.\n‘Rathillet’ was attempted before fifteen, ‘The Vendetta’ at twenty-nine,\nand the succession of defeats lasted unbroken till I was thirty-one.  By\nthat time, I had written little books and little essays and short\nstories; and had got patted on the back and paid for them—though not\nenough to live upon.  I had quite a reputation, I was the successful man;\nI passed my days in toil, the futility of which would sometimes make my\ncheek to burn—that I should spend a man’s energy upon this business, and\nyet could not earn a livelihood: and still there shone ahead of me an\nunattained ideal: although I had attempted the thing with vigour not less\nthan ten or twelve times, I had not yet written a novel.  All—all my\npretty ones—had gone for a little, and then stopped inexorably like a\nschoolboy’s watch.  I might be compared to a cricketer of many years’\nstanding who should never have made a run.  Anybody can write a short\nstory—a bad one, I mean—who has industry and paper and time enough; but\nnot every one may hope to write even a bad novel.  It is the length that\nkills.\n\nThe accepted novelist may take his novel up and put it down, spend days\nupon it in vain, and write not any more than he makes haste to blot.  Not\nso the beginner.  Human nature has certain rights; instinct—the instinct\nof self-preservation—forbids that any man (cheered and supported by the\nconsciousness of no previous victory) should endure the miseries of\nunsuccessful literary toil beyond a period to be measured in weeks.\nThere must be something for hope to feed upon.  The beginner must have a\nslant of wind, a lucky vein must be running, he must be in one of those\nhours when the words come and the phrases balance of themselves—_even to\nbegin_.  And having begun, what a dread looking forward is that until the\nbook shall be accomplished!  For so long a time, the slant is to continue\nunchanged, the vein to keep running, for so long a time you must keep at\ncommand the same quality of style: for so long a time your puppets are to\nbe always vital, always consistent, always vigorous!  I remember I used\nto look, in those days, upon every three-volume novel with a sort of\nveneration, as a feat—not possibly of literature—but at least of physical\nand moral endurance and the courage of Ajax.\n\nIn the fated year I came to live with my father and mother at Kinnaird,\nabove Pitlochry.  Then I walked on the red moors and by the side of the\ngolden burn; the rude, pure air of our mountains inspirited, if it did\nnot inspire us, and my wife and I projected a joint volume of logic\nstories, for which she wrote ‘The Shadow on the Bed,’ and I turned out\n‘Thrawn Janet,’ and a first draft of ‘The Merry Men.’  I love my native\nair, but it does not love me; and the end of this delightful period was a\ncold, a fly-blister, and a migration by Strathairdle and Glenshee to the\nCastleton of Braemar.\n\nThere it blew a good deal and rained in a proportion; my native air was\nmore unkind than man’s ingratitude, and I must consent to pass a good\ndeal of my time between four walls in a house lugubriously known as the\nLate Miss McGregor’s Cottage.  And now admire the finger of\npredestination.  There was a schoolboy in the Late Miss McGregor’s\nCottage, home from the holidays, and much in want of ‘something craggy to\nbreak his mind upon.’  He had no thought of literature; it was the art of\nRaphael that received his fleeting suffrages; and with the aid of pen and\nink and a shilling box of water colours, he had soon turned one of the\nrooms into a picture gallery.  My more immediate duty towards the gallery\nwas to be showman; but I would sometimes unbend a little, join the artist\n(so to speak) at the easel, and pass the afternoon with him in a generous\nemulation, making coloured drawings.  On one of these occasions, I made\nthe map of an island; it was elaborately and (I thought) beautifully\ncoloured; the shape of it took my fancy beyond expression; it contained\nharbours that pleased me like sonnets; and with the unconsciousness of\nthe predestined, I ticketed my performance ‘Treasure Island.’  I am told\nthere are people who do not care for maps, and find it hard to believe.\nThe names, the shapes of the woodlands, the courses of the roads and\nrivers, the prehistoric footsteps of man still distinctly traceable up\nhill and down dale, the mills and the ruins, the ponds and the ferries,\nperhaps the _Standing Stone_ or the _Druidic Circle_ on the heath; here\nis an inexhaustible fund of interest for any man with eyes to see or\ntwopence-worth of imagination to understand with!  No child but must\nremember laying his head in the grass, staring into the infinitesimal\nforest and seeing it grow populous with fairy armies.\n\nSomewhat in this way, as I paused upon my map of ‘Treasure Island,’ the\nfuture character of the book began to appear there visibly among\nimaginary woods; and their brown faces and bright weapons peeped out upon\nme from unexpected quarters, as they passed to and fro, fighting and\nhunting treasure, on these few square inches of a flat projection.  The\nnext thing I knew I had some papers before me and was writing out a list\nof chapters.  How often have I done so, and the thing gone no further!\nBut there seemed elements of success about this enterprise.  It was to be\na story for boys; no need of psychology or fine writing; and I had a boy\nat hand to be a touchstone.  Women were excluded.  I was unable to handle\na brig (which the _Hispaniola_ should have been), but I thought I could\nmake shift to sail her as a schooner without public shame.  And then I\nhad an idea for John Silver from which I promised myself funds of\nentertainment; to take an admired friend of mine (whom the reader very\nlikely knows and admires as much as I do), to deprive him of all his\nfiner qualities and higher graces of temperament, to leave him with\nnothing but his strength, his courage, his quickness, and his magnificent\ngeniality, and to try to express these in terms of the culture of a raw\ntarpaulin.  Such psychical surgery is, I think, a common way of ‘making\ncharacter’; perhaps it is, indeed, the only way.  We can put in the\nquaint figure that spoke a hundred words with us yesterday by the\nwayside; but do we know him?  Our friend, with his infinite variety and\nflexibility, we know—but can we put him in?  Upon the first, we must\nengraft secondary and imaginary qualities, possibly all wrong; from the\nsecond, knife in hand, we must cut away and deduct the needless\narborescence of his nature, but the trunk and the few branches that\nremain we may at least be fairly sure of.\n\nOn a chill September morning, by the cheek of a brisk fire, and the rain\ndrumming on the window, I began _The Sea Cook_, for that was the original\ntitle.  I have begun (and finished) a number of other books, but I cannot\nremember to have sat down to one of them with more complacency.  It is\nnot to be wondered at, for stolen waters are proverbially sweet.  I am\nnow upon a painful chapter.  No doubt the parrot once belonged to\nRobinson Crusoe.  No doubt the skeleton is conveyed from Poe.  I think\nlittle of these, they are trifles and details; and no man can hope to\nhave a monopoly of skeletons or make a corner in talking birds.  The\nstockade, I am told, is from _Masterman Ready_.  It may be, I care not a\njot.  These useful writers had fulfilled the poet’s saying: departing,\nthey had left behind them Footprints on the sands of time, Footprints\nwhich perhaps another—and I was the other!  It is my debt to Washington\nIrving that exercises my conscience, and justly so, for I believe\nplagiarism was rarely carried farther.  I chanced to pick up the _Tales\nof a Traveller_ some years ago with a view to an anthology of prose\nnarrative, and the book flew up and struck me: Billy Bones, his chest,\nthe company in the parlour, the whole inner spirit, and a good deal of\nthe material detail of my first chapters—all were there, all were the\nproperty of Washington Irving.  But I had no guess of it then as I sat\nwriting by the fireside, in what seemed the spring-tides of a somewhat\npedestrian inspiration; nor yet day by day, after lunch, as I read aloud\nmy morning’s work to the family.  It seemed to me original as sin; it\nseemed to belong to me like my right eye.  I had counted on one boy, I\nfound I had two in my audience.  My father caught fire at once with all\nthe romance and childishness of his original nature.  His own stories,\nthat every night of his life he put himself to sleep with, dealt\nperpetually with ships, roadside inns, robbers, old sailors, and\ncommercial travellers before the era of steam.  He never finished one of\nthese romances; the lucky man did not require to!  But in _Treasure\nIsland_ he recognised something kindred to his own imagination; it was\n_his_ kind of picturesque; and he not only heard with delight the daily\nchapter, but set himself acting to collaborate.  When the time came for\nBilly Bones’s chest to be ransacked, he must have passed the better part\nof a day preparing, on the back of a legal envelope, an inventory of its\ncontents, which I exactly followed; and the name of ‘Flint’s old\nship’—the _Walrus_—was given at his particular request.  And now who\nshould come dropping in, _ex machinâ_, but Dr. Japp, like the disguised\nprince who is to bring down the curtain upon peace and happiness in the\nlast act; for he carried in his pocket, not a horn or a talisman, but a\npublisher—had, in fact, been charged by my old friend, Mr. Henderson, to\nunearth new writers for _Young Folks_.  Even the ruthlessness of a united\nfamily recoiled before the extreme measure of inflicting on our guest the\nmutilated members of _The Sea Cook_; at the same time, we would by no\nmeans stop our readings; and accordingly the tale was begun again at the\nbeginning, and solemnly re-delivered for the benefit of Dr. Japp.  From\nthat moment on, I have thought highly of his critical faculty; for when\nhe left us, he carried away the manuscript in his portmanteau.\n\nHere, then, was everything to keep me up, sympathy, help, and now a\npositive engagement.  I had chosen besides a very easy style.  Compare it\nwith the almost contemporary ‘Merry Men’, one reader may prefer the one\nstyle, one the other—’tis an affair of character, perhaps of mood; but no\nexpert can fail to see that the one is much more difficult, and the other\nmuch easier to maintain.  It seems as though a full-grown experienced man\nof letters might engage to turn out _Treasure Island_ at so many pages a\nday, and keep his pipe alight.  But alas! this was not my case.  Fifteen\ndays I stuck to it, and turned out fifteen chapters; and then, in the\nearly paragraphs of the sixteenth, ignominiously lost hold.  My mouth was\nempty; there was not one word of _Treasure Island_ in my bosom; and here\nwere the proofs of the beginning already waiting me at the ‘Hand and\nSpear’!  Then I corrected them, living for the most part alone, walking\non the heath at Weybridge in dewy autumn mornings, a good deal pleased\nwith what I had done, and more appalled than I can depict to you in words\nat what remained for me to do.  I was thirty-one; I was the head of a\nfamily; I had lost my health; I had never yet paid my way, never yet made\n£200 a year; my father had quite recently bought back and cancelled a\nbook that was judged a failure: was this to be another and last fiasco?\nI was indeed very close on despair; but I shut my mouth hard, and during\nthe journey to Davos, where I was to pass the winter, had the resolution\nto think of other things and bury myself in the novels of M. de\nBoisgobey.  Arrived at my destination, down I sat one morning to the\nunfinished tale; and behold! it flowed from me like small talk; and in a\nsecond tide of delighted industry, and again at a rate of a chapter a\nday, I finished _Treasure Island_.  It had to be transcribed almost\nexactly; my wife was ill; the schoolboy remained alone of the faithful;\nand John Addington Symonds (to whom I timidly mentioned what I was\nengaged on) looked on me askance.  He was at that time very eager I\nshould write on the characters of Theophrastus: so far out may be the\njudgments of the wisest men.  But Symonds (to be sure) was scarce the\nconfidant to go to for sympathy on a boy’s story.  He was large-minded;\n‘a full man,’ if there was one; but the very name of my enterprise would\nsuggest to him only capitulations of sincerity and solecisms of style.\nWell! he was not far wrong.\n\n_Treasure Island_—it was Mr. Henderson who deleted the first title, _The\nSea Cook_—appeared duly in the story paper, where it figured in the\nignoble midst, without woodcuts, and attracted not the least attention.\nI did not care.  I liked the tale myself, for much the same reason as my\nfather liked the beginning: it was my kind of picturesque.  I was not a\nlittle proud of John Silver, also; and to this day rather admire that\nsmooth and formidable adventurer.  What was infinitely more exhilarating,\nI had passed a landmark; I had finished a tale, and written ‘The End’\nupon my manuscript, as I had not done since ‘The Pentland Rising,’ when I\nwas a boy of sixteen not yet at college.  In truth it was so by a set of\nlucky accidents; had not Dr. Japp come on his visit, had not the tale\nflowed from me with singular case, it must have been laid aside like its\npredecessors, and found a circuitous and unlamented way to the fire.\nPurists may suggest it would have been better so.  I am not of that mind.\nThe tale seems to have given much pleasure, and it brought (or, was the\nmeans of bringing) fire and food and wine to a deserving family in which\nI took an interest.  I need scarcely say I mean my own.\n\nBut the adventures of _Treasure Island_ are not yet quite at an end.  I\nhad written it up to the map.  The map was the chief part of my plot.\nFor instance, I had called an islet ‘Skeleton Island,’ not knowing what I\nmeant, seeking only for the immediate picturesque, and it was to justify\nthis name that I broke into the gallery of Mr. Poe and stole Flint’s\npointer.  And in the same way, it was because I had made two harbours\nthat the _Hispaniola_ was sent on her wanderings with Israel Hands.  The\ntime came when it was decided to republish, and I sent in my manuscript,\nand the map along with it, to Messrs. Cassell.  The proofs came, they\nwere corrected, but I heard nothing of the map.  I wrote and asked; was\ntold it had never been received, and sat aghast.  It is one thing to draw\na map at random, set a scale in one corner of it at a venture, and write\nup a story to the measurements.  It is quite another to have to examine a\nwhole book, make an inventory of all the allusions contained in it, and\nwith a pair of compasses, painfully design a map to suit the data.  I did\nit; and the map was drawn again in my father’s office, with\nembellishments of blowing whales and sailing ships, and my father himself\nbrought into service a knack he had of various writing, and elaborately\n_forged_ the signature of Captain Flint, and the sailing directions of\nBilly Bones.  But somehow it was never _Treasure Island_ to me.\n\nI have said the map was the most of the plot.  I might almost say it was\nthe whole.  A few reminiscences of Poe, Defoe, and Washington Irving, a\ncopy of Johnson’s _Buccaneers_, the name of the Dead Man’s Chest from\nKingsley’s _At Last_, some recollections of canoeing on the high seas,\nand the map itself, with its infinite, eloquent suggestion, made up the\nwhole of my materials.  It is, perhaps, not often that a map figures so\nlargely in a tale, yet it is always important.  The author must know his\ncountryside, whether real or imaginary, like his hand; the distances, the\npoints of the compass, the place of the sun’s rising, the behaviour of\nthe moon, should all be beyond cavil.  And how troublesome the moon is!\nI have come to grief over the moon in _Prince Otto_, and so soon as that\nwas pointed out to me, adopted a precaution which I recommend to other\nmen—I never write now without an almanack.  With an almanack, and the map\nof the country, and the plan of every house, either actually plotted on\npaper or already and immediately apprehended in the mind, a man may hope\nto avoid some of the grossest possible blunders.  With the map before\nhim, he will scarce allow the sun to set in the east, as it does in _The\nAntiquary_.  With the almanack at hand, he will scarce allow two\nhorsemen, journeying on the most urgent affair, to employ six days, from\nthree of the Monday morning till late in the Saturday night, upon a\njourney of, say, ninety or a hundred miles, and before the week is out,\nand still on the same nags, to cover fifty in one day, as may be read at\nlength in the inimitable novel of _Rob Roy_.  And it is certainly well,\nthough far from necessary, to avoid such ‘croppers.’  But it is my\ncontention—my superstition, if you like—that who is faithful to his map,\nand consults it, and draws from it his inspiration, daily and hourly,\ngains positive support, and not mere negative immunity from accident.\nThe tale has a root there; it grows in that soil; it has a spine of its\nown behind the words.  Better if the country be real, and he has walked\nevery foot of it and knows every milestone.  But even with imaginary\nplaces, he will do well in the beginning to provide a map; as he studies\nit, relations will appear that he had not thought upon; he will discover\nobvious, though unsuspected, short-cuts and footprints for his\nmessengers; and even when a map is not all the plot, as it was in\n_Treasure Island_, it will be found to be a mine of suggestion.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GENESIS OF ‘THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE’\n\n\nI was walking one night in the verandah of a small house in which I\nlived, outside the hamlet of Saranac.  It was winter; the night was very\ndark; the air extraordinary clear and cold, and sweet with the purity of\nforests.  From a good way below, the river was to be heard contending\nwith ice and boulders: a few lights appeared, scattered unevenly among\nthe darkness, but so far away as not to lessen the sense of isolation.\nFor the making of a story here were fine conditions.  I was besides moved\nwith the spirit of emulation, for I had just finished my third or fourth\nperusal of _The Phantom Ship_.  ‘Come,’ said I to my engine, ‘let us make\na tale, a story of many years and countries, of the sea and the land,\nsavagery and civilisation; a story that shall have the same large\nfeatures, and may be treated in the same summary elliptic method as the\nbook you have been reading and admiring.’  I was here brought up with a\nreflection exceedingly just in itself, but which, as the sequel shows, I\nfailed to profit by.  I saw that Marryat, not less than Homer, Milton,\nand Virgil, profited by the choice of a familiar and legendary subject;\nso that he prepared his readers on the very title-page; and this set me\ncudgelling my brains, if by any chance I could hit upon some similar\nbelief to be the centre-piece of my own meditated fiction.  In the course\nof this vain search there cropped up in my memory a singular case of a\nburied and resuscitated fakir, which I had been often told by an uncle of\nmine, then lately dead, Inspector-General John Balfour.\n\nOn such a fine frosty night, with no wind and the thermometer below zero,\nthe brain works with much vivacity; and the next moment I had seen the\ncircumstance transplanted from India and the tropics to the Adirondack\nwilderness and the stringent cold of the Canadian border.  Here then,\nalmost before I had begun my story, I had two countries, two of the ends\nof the earth involved: and thus though the notion of the resuscitated man\nfailed entirely on the score of general acceptation, or even (as I have\nsince found) acceptability, it fitted at once with my design of a tale of\nmany lands; and this decided me to consider further of its possibilities.\nThe man who should thus be buried was the first question: a good man,\nwhose return to life would be hailed by the reader and the other\ncharacters with gladness?  This trenched upon the Christian picture, and\nwas dismissed.  If the idea, then, was to be of any use at all for me, I\nhad to create a kind of evil genius to his friends and family, take him\nthrough many disappearances, and make this final restoration from the pit\nof death, in the icy American wilderness, the last and the grimmest of\nthe series.  I need not tell my brothers of the craft that I was now in\nthe most interesting moment of an author’s life; the hours that followed\nthat night upon the balcony, and the following nights and days, whether\nwalking abroad or lying wakeful in my bed, were hours of unadulterated\njoy.  My mother, who was then living with me alone, perhaps had less\nenjoyment; for, in the absence of my wife, who is my usual helper in\nthese times of parturition, I must spur her up at all seasons to hear me\nrelate and try to clarify my unformed fancies.\n\nAnd while I was groping for the fable and the character required, behold\nI found them lying ready and nine years old in my memory.  Pease porridge\nhot, pease porridge cold, pease porridge in the pot, nine years old.  Was\nthere ever a more complete justification of the rule of Horace?  Here,\nthinking of quite other things, I had stumbled on the solution, or\nperhaps I should rather say (in stagewright phrase) the Curtain or final\nTableau of a story conceived long before on the moors between Pitlochry\nand Strathardle, conceived in Highland rain, in the blend of the smell of\nheather and bog-plants, and with a mind full of the Athole correspondence\nand the memories of the dumlicide Justice.  So long ago, so far away it\nwas, that I had first evoked the faces and the mutual tragic situation of\nthe men of Durrisdeer.\n\nMy story was now world-wide enough: Scotland, India, and America being\nall obligatory scenes.  But of these India was strange to me except in\nbooks; I had never known any living Indian save a Parsee, a member of my\nclub in London, equally civilised, and (to all seeing) equally accidental\nwith myself.  It was plain, thus far, that I should have to get into\nIndia and out of it again upon a foot of fairy lightness; and I believe\nthis first suggested to me the idea of the Chevalier Burke for a\nnarrator.  It was at first intended that he should be Scottish, and I was\nthen filled with fears that he might prove only the degraded shadow of my\nown Alan Breck.  Presently, however, it began to occur to me it would be\nlike my Master to curry favour with the Prince’s Irishmen; and that an\nIrish refugee would have a particular reason to find himself in India\nwith his countryman, the unfortunate Lally.  Irish, therefore, I decided\nhe should be, and then, all of a sudden, I was aware of a tall shadow\nacross my path, the shadow of Barry Lyndon.  No man (in Lord Foppington’s\nphrase) of a nice morality could go very deep with my Master: in the\noriginal idea of this story conceived in Scotland, this companion had\nbeen besides intended to be worse than the bad elder son with whom (as it\nwas then meant) he was to visit Scotland; if I took an Irishman, and a\nvery bad Irishman, in the midst of the eighteenth century, how was I to\nevade Barry Lyndon?  The wretch besieged me, offering his services; he\ngave me excellent references; he proved that he was highly fitted for the\nwork I had to do; he, or my own evil heart, suggested it was easy to\ndisguise his ancient livery wit a little lace and a few frogs and\nbuttons, so that Thackeray himself should hardly recognise him.  And then\nof a sudden there came to me memories of a young Irishman, with whom I\nwas once intimate, and had spent long nights walking and talking with,\nupon a very desolate coast in a bleak autumn: I recalled him as a youth\nof an extraordinary moral simplicity—almost vacancy; plastic to any\ninfluence, the creature of his admirations: and putting such a youth in\nfancy into the career of a soldier of fortune, it occurred to me that he\nwould serve my turn as well as Mr. Lyndon, and in place of entering into\ncompetition with the Master, would afford a slight though a distinct\nrelief.  I know not if I have done him well, though his moral\ndissertations always highly entertained me: but I own I have been\nsurprised to find that he reminded some critics of Barry Lyndon after\nall. . . .\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO ‘THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE’ {145}\n\n\nAlthough an old, consistent exile, the editor of the following pages\nrevisits now and again the city of which he exults to be a native; and\nthere are few things more strange, more painful, or more salutary, than\nsuch revisitations.  Outside, in foreign spots, he comes by surprise and\nawakens more attention than he had expected; in his own city, the\nrelation is reversed, and he stands amazed to be so little recollected.\nElsewhere he is refreshed to see attractive faces, to remark possible\nfriends; there he scouts the long streets, with a pang at heart, for the\nfaces and friends that are no more.  Elsewhere he is delighted with the\npresence of what is new, there tormented by the absence of what is old.\nElsewhere he is content to be his present self; there he is smitten with\nan equal regret for what he once was and for what he once hoped to be.\n\nHe was feeling all this dimly, as he drove from the station, on his last\nvisit; he was feeling it still as he alighted at the door of his friend\nMr. Johnstone Thomson, W.S., with whom he was to stay.  A hearty welcome,\na face not altogether changed, a few words that sounded of old days, a\nlaugh provoked and shared, a glimpse in passing of the snowy cloth and\nbright decanters and the Piranesis on the dining-room wall, brought him\nto his bed-room with a somewhat lightened cheer, and when he and Mr.\nThomson sat down a few minutes later, cheek by jowl, and pledged the past\nin a preliminary bumper, he was already almost consoled, he had already\nalmost forgiven himself his two unpardonable errors, that he should ever\nhave left his native city, or ever returned to it.\n\n‘I have something quite in your way,’ said Mr. Thomson.  ‘I wished to do\nhonour to your arrival; because, my dear fellow, it is my own youth that\ncomes back along with you; in a very tattered and withered state, to be\nsure, but—well!—all that’s left of it.’\n\n‘A great deal better than nothing,’ said the editor.  ‘But what is this\nwhich is quite in my way?’\n\n‘I was coming to that,’ said Mr. Thomson: ‘Fate has put it in my power to\nhonour your arrival with something really original by way of dessert.  A\nmystery.’\n\n‘A mystery?’ I repeated.\n\n‘Yes,’ said his friend, ‘a mystery.  It may prove to be nothing, and it\nmay prove to be a great deal.  But in the meanwhile it is truly\nmysterious, no eye having looked on it for near a hundred years; it is\nhighly genteel, for it treats of a titled family; and it ought to be\nmelodramatic, for (according to the superscription) it is concerned with\ndeath.’\n\n‘I think I rarely heard a more obscure or a more promising annunciation,’\nthe other remarked.  ‘But what is It?’\n\n‘You remember my predecessor’s, old Peter M‘Brair’s business?’\n\n‘I remember him acutely; he could not look at me without a pang of\nreprobation, and he could not feel the pang without betraying it.  He was\nto me a man of a great historical interest, but the interest was not\nreturned.’\n\n‘Ah well, we go beyond him,’ said Mr. Thomson.  ‘I daresay old Peter knew\nas little about this as I do.  You see, I succeeded to a prodigious\naccumulation of old law-papers and old tin boxes, some of them of Peter’s\nhoarding, some of his father’s, John, first of the dynasty, a great man\nin his day.  Among other collections were all the papers of the\nDurrisdeers.’\n\n‘The Durrisdeers!’ cried I.  ‘My dear fellow, these may be of the\ngreatest interest.  One of them was out in the ’45; one had some strange\npassages with the devil—you will find a note of it in Law’s _Memorials_,\nI think; and there was an unexplained tragedy, I know not what, much\nlater, about a hundred years ago—‘\n\n‘More than a hundred years ago,’ said Mr. Thomson.  ‘In 1783.’\n\n‘How do you know that?  I mean some death.’\n\n‘Yes, the lamentable deaths of my lord Durrisdeer and his brother, the\nMaster of Ballantrae (attainted in the troubles),’ said Mr. Thomson with\nsomething the tone of a man quoting.  ‘Is that it?’\n\n‘To say truth,’ said I, ‘I have only seen some dim reference to the\nthings in memoirs; and heard some traditions dimmer still, through my\nuncle (whom I think you knew).  My uncle lived when he was a boy in the\nneighbourhood of St. Bride’s; he has often told me of the avenue closed\nup and grown over with grass, the great gates never opened, the last lord\nand his old maid sister who lived in the back parts of the house, a\nquiet, plain, poor, hum-drum couple it would seem—but pathetic too, as\nthe last of that stirring and brave house—and, to the country folk,\nfaintly terrible from some deformed traditions.’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Mr. Thomson.  Henry Graeme Durie, the last lord, died in\n1820; his sister, the Honourable Miss Katherine Durie, in ’27; so much I\nknow; and by what I have been going over the last few days, they were\nwhat you say, decent, quiet people and not rich.  To say truth, it was a\nletter of my lord’s that put me on the search for the packet we are going\nto open this evening.  Some papers could not be found; and he wrote to\nJack M‘Brair suggesting they might be among those sealed up by a Mr.\nMackellar.  M‘Brair answered, that the papers in question were all in\nMackellar’s own hand, all (as the writer understood) of a purely\nnarrative character; and besides, said he, “I am bound not to open them\nbefore the year 1889.”  You may fancy if these words struck me: I\ninstituted a hunt through all the M‘Brair repositories; and at last hit\nupon that packet which (if you have had enough wine) I propose to show\nyou at once.’\n\nIn the smoking-room, to which my host now led me, was a packet, fastened\nwith many seals and enclosed in a single sheet of strong paper thus\nendorsed:—\n\n    Papers relating to the lives and lamentable deaths of the late Lord\n    Durisdeer, and his elder brother James, commonly called Master of\n    Ballantrae, attainted in the troubles: entrusted into the hands of\n    John M‘Brair in the Lawnmarket of Edinburgh, W.S.; this 20th day of\n    September Anno Domini 1789; by him to be kept secret until the\n    revolution of one hundred years complete, or until the 20th day of\n    September 1889: the same compiled and written by me,\n\n                                                        EPHRAIM MACKELLAR,\n                                _For near forty years Land Steward on the_\n                                                _estates of His Lordship_.\n\nAs Mr. Thomson is a married man, I will not say what hour had struck when\nwe laid down the last of the following pages; but I will give a few words\nof what ensued.\n\n‘Here,’ said Mr. Thomson, ‘is a novel ready to your hand: all you have to\ndo is to work up the scenery, develop the characters, and improve the\nstyle.’\n\n‘My dear fellow,’ said I, ‘they are just the three things that I would\nrather die than set my hand to.  It shall be published as it stands.’\n\n‘But it’s so bald,’ objected Mr. Thomson.\n\n‘I believe there is nothing so noble as baldness,’ replied I, ‘and I am\nsure there is nothing so interesting.  I would have all literature bald,\nand all authors (if you like) but one.’\n\n‘Well, well,’ said Mr. Thomson, ‘we shall see.’\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n         Printed by T. and A.
