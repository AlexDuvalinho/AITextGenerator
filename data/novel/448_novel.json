Having\nrecognised that there are no phenomena of which the first cause\nis still accessible, science has resumed the examination of her\nancient certitudes, and has proved their fragility.  To-day she\nsees her ancient principles vanishing one by one.  Mechanics is\nlosing its axioms, and matter, formerly the eternal substratum of\nthe worlds, becomes a simple aggregate of ephemeral forces in\ntransitory condensation.\n\nDespite its conjectural side, by virtue of which it to some\nextent escapes the severest form of criticism, history has not\nbeen free from this universal revision.  There is no longer a\nsingle one of its phases of which we can say that it is certainly\nknown.  What appeared to be definitely acquired is now once more\nput in question.\n\nAmong the events whose study seemed completed was the French\nRevolution.  Analysed by several generations of writers, one\nmight suppose it to be perfectly elucidated.  What new thing can\nbe said of it, except in modification of some of its details?\n\nAnd yet its most positive defenders are beginning to hesitate in\ntheir judgments.  Ancient evidence proves to be far from\nimpeccable.  The faith in dogmas once held sacred is shaken.  The\nlatest literature of the Revolution betrays these uncertainties.\nHaving related, men are more and more chary of drawing\nconclusions.\n\nNot only are the heroes of this great drama discussed without\nindulgence, but thinkers are asking whether the new dispensation\nwhich followed the ancien regime would not have established\nitself naturally, without violence, in the course of progressive\ncivilisation.  The results obtained no longer seem in\ncorrespondence either with their immediate cost or with the\nremoter consequences which the Revolution evoked from the\npossibilities of history.\n\nSeveral causes have led to the revision of this tragic period.\nTime has calmed passions, numerous documents have gradually\nemerged from the archives, and the historian is learning to\ninterpret them independently.\n\nBut it is perhaps modern psychology that has most effectually\ninfluenced our ideas, by enabling us more surely to read men and\nthe motives of their conduct.\n\nAmong those of its discoveries which are henceforth applicable to\nhistory we must mention, above all, a more profound understanding\nof ancestral influences, the laws which rule the actions of the\ncrowd, data relating to the disaggregation of personality, mental\ncontagion, the unconscious formation of beliefs, and the\ndistinction between the various forms of logic.\n\nTo tell the truth, these applications of science, which are\nutilised in this book, have not been so utilised hitherto.\nHistorians have generally stopped short at the study of\ndocuments, and even that study is sufficient to excite the doubts\nof which I have spoken.\n\n\nThe great events which shape the destinies of peoples--\nrevolutions, for example, and the outbreak of religious beliefs--\nare sometimes so difficult to explain that one must limit oneself\nto a mere statement.\n\nFrom the time of my first historical researches I have been\nstruck by the impenetrable aspect of certain essential phenomena,\nthose relating to the genesis of beliefs especially; I felt\nconvinced that something fundamental was lacking that was\nessential to their interpretation.  Reason having said all it\ncould say, nothing more could be expected of it, and other means\nmust be sought of comprehending what had not been elucidated.\n\nFor a long time these important questions remained obscure to me.\nExtended travel, devoted to the study of the remnants of vanished\ncivilisations, had not done much to throw light upon them.\n\nReflecting upon it continually, I was forced to recognise that\nthe problem was composed of a series of other problems, which I\nshould have to study separately.  This I did for a period of\ntwenty years, presenting the results of my researches in a\nsuccession of volumes.\n\nOne of the first was devoted to the study of the psychological\nlaws of the evolution of peoples.  Having shown that the\nhistoric races--that is, the races formed by the hazards of\nhistory--finally acquired psychological characteristics as stable\nas their anatomical characteristics, I attempted to explain how a\npeople transforms its institutions, its languages, and its arts.\nI explained in the same work why it was that individual\npersonalities, under the influence of sudden variations of\nenvironment, might be entirely disaggregated.\n\nBut besides the fixed collectivities formed by the peoples, there\nare mobile and transitory collectivities known as crowds.  Now\nthese crowds or mobs, by the aid of which the great movements of\nhistory are accomplished, have characteristics absolutely\ndifferent from those of the individuals who compose them.  What\nare these characteristics, and how are they evolved?  This new\nproblem was examined in The Psychology of the Crowd.\n\nOnly after these studies did I begin to perceive certain\ninfluences which had escaped me.\n\nBut this was not all.  Among the most important factors of\nhistory one was preponderant--the factor of beliefs.  How are\nthese beliefs born, and are they really rational and voluntary,\nas was long taught?  Are they not rather unconscious and\nindependent of all reason?  A difficult question, which I dealt\nwith in my last book, Opinions and Beliefs.\n\nSo long as psychology regards beliefs as voluntary and rational\nthey will remain inexplicable.  Having proved that they are\nusually irrational and always involuntary, I was able to propound\nthe solution of this important problem; how it was that beliefs\nwhich no reason could justify were admitted without\ndifficulty by the most enlightened spirits of all ages.\n\nThe solution of the historical difficulties which had so long\nbeen sought was thenceforth obvious.  I arrived at the conclusion\nthat beside the rational logic which conditions thought, and was\nformerly regarded as our sole guide, there exist very different\nforms of logic: affective logic, collective logic, and mystic\nlogic, which usually overrule the reason and engender the\ngenerative impulses of our conduct.\n\nThis fact well established, it seemed to me evident that if a\ngreat number of historical events are often uncomprehended, it is\nbecause we seek to interpret them in the light of a logic which\nin reality has very little influence upon their genesis.\n\n\nAll these researches, which are here summed up in a few lines,\ndemanded long years for their accomplishment.  Despairing of\ncompleting them, I abandoned them more than once to return to\nthose labours of the laboratory in which one is always sure of\nskirting the truth and of acquiring fragments at least of\ncertitude.\n\nBut while it is very interesting to explore the world of material\nphenomena, it is still more so to decipher men, for which reason\nI have always been led back to psychology.\n\nCertain principles deduced from my researches appearing likely to\nprove fruitful, I resolved to apply them to the study of concrete\ninstances, and was thus led to deal with the Psychology of\nRevolutions--notably that of the French Revolution.\n\nProceeding in the analysis of our great Revolution, the\ngreater part of the opinions determined by the reading of books\ndeserted me one by one, although I had considered them\nunshakable.\n\nTo explain this period we must consider it as a whole, as many\nhistorians have done.  It is composed of phenomena simultaneous\nbut independent of one another.\n\nEach of its phases reveals events engendered by psychological\nlaws working with the regularity of clockwork.  The actors in\nthis great drama seem to move like the characters of a previously\ndetermined drama.  Each says what he must say, acts as he is\nbound to act.\n\nTo be sure, the actors in the revolutionary drama differed from\nthose of a written drama in that they had not studied their\nparts, but these were dictated by invisible forces.\n\nPrecisely because they were subjected to the inevitable\nprogression of logics incomprehensible to them we see them as\ngreatly astonished by the events of which they were the heroes as\nare we ourselves.  Never did they suspect the invisible powers\nwhich forced them to act.  They were the masters neither of their\nfury nor their weakness.  They spoke in the name of reason,\npretending to be guided by reason, but in reality it was by no\nmeans reason that impelled them.\n\n``The decisions for which we are so greatly reproached,'' wrote\nBillaud-Varenne, ``were more often than otherwise not intended or\ndesired by us two days or even one day beforehand: the crisis\nalone evoked them.''\n\nNot that we must consider the events of the Revolution as\ndominated by an imperious fatality.  The readers of our works\nwill know that we recognise in the man of superior qualities the\nrole of averting fatalities.  But he can dissociate himself\nonly from a few of such, and is often powerless before the\nsequence of events which even at their origin could scarcely be\nruled.  The scientist knows how to destroy the microbe before it\nhas time to act, but he knows himself powerless to prevent the\nevolution of the resulting malady.\n\n\nWhen any question gives rise to violently contradictory opinions\nwe may be sure that it belongs to the province of beliefs and not\nto that of knowledge.\n\nWe have shown in a preceding work that belief, of unconscious\norigin and independent of all reason, can never be influenced by\nreason.\n\nThe Revolution, the work of believers, has seldom been judged by\nany but believers.  Execrated by some and praised by others, it\nhas remained one of those dogmas which are accepted or rejected\nas a whole, without the intervention of rational logic.\n\nAlthough in its beginnings a religious or political revolution\nmay very well be supported by rational elements, it is developed\nonly by the aid of mystic and affective elements which are\nabsolutely foreign to reason.\n\nThe historians who have judged the events of the French\nRevolution in the name of rational logic could not comprehend\nthem, since this form of logic did not dictate them.  As the\nactors of these events themselves understood them but ill, we\nshall not be far from the truth in saying that our\nRevolution was a phenomenon equally misunderstood by those\nwho caused it and by those who have described it.  At no period\nof history did men so little grasp the present, so greatly ignore\nthe past, and so poorly divine the future.\n\n\n. . . The power of the Revolution did not reside in the\nprinciples--which for that matter were anything but novel--which\nit sought to propagate, nor in the institutions which it sought\nto found.  The people cares very little for institutions and even\nless for doctrines.  That the Revolution was potent indeed, that\nit made France accept the violence, the murders, the ruin and the\nhorror of a frightful civil war, that finally it defended itself\nvictoriously against a Europe in arms, was due to the fact that\nit had founded not a new system of government but a new religion.\n\nNow history shows us how irresistible is the might of a strong\nbelief.  Invincible Rome herself had to bow before the armies of\nnomad shepherds illuminated by the faith of Mahommed.  For the\nsame reason the kings of Europe could not resist the\ntatterdemalion soldiers of the Convention.  Like all apostles,\nthey were ready to immolate themselves in the sole end of\npropagating their beliefs, which according to their dream were to\nrenew the world.\n\nThe religion thus founded had the force of other religions, if\nnot their duration.  Yet it did not perish without leaving\nindelible traces, and its influence is active still.\n\n\nWe shall not consider the Revolution as a clean sweep in\nhistory, as its apostles believed it.  We know that to\ndemonstrate their intention of creating a world distinct from the\nold they initiated a new era and professed to break entirely with\nall vestiges of the past.\n\nBut the past never dies.  It is even more truly within us than\nwithout us.  Against their will the reformers of the Revolution\nremained saturated with the past, and could only continue, under\nother names, the traditions of the monarchy, even exaggerating\nthe autocracy and centralisation of the old system.  Tocqueville\nhad no difficulty in proving that the Revolution did little but\noverturn that which was about to fall.\n\nIf in reality the Revolution destroyed but little it favoured the\nfruition of certain ideas which continued thenceforth to develop.\n\nThe fraternity and liberty which it proclaimed never greatly\nseduced the peoples, but equality became their gospel: the pivot\nof socialism and of the entire evolution of modern democratic\nideas.  We may therefore say that the Revolution did not end with\nthe advent of the Empire, nor with the successive restorations\nwhich followed it.  Secretly or in the light of day it has slowly\nunrolled itself and still affects men's minds.\n\n\nThe study of the French Revolution to which a great part of this\nbook is devoted will perhaps deprive the reader of more than one\nillusion, by proving to him that the books which recount the\nhistory of the Revolution contain in reality a mass of legends\nvery remote from reality.\n\nThese legends will doubtless retain more life than history\nitself.  Do not regret this too greatly.  It may interest a few\nphilosophers to know the truth, but the peoples will always\nprefer dreams.  Synthetising their ideal, such dreams will always\nconstitute powerful motives of action.  One would lose courage\nwere it not sustained by false ideas, said Fontenelle.  Joan of\nArc, the Giants of the Convention, the Imperial epic--all these\ndazzling images of the past will always remain sources of hope in\nthe gloomy hours that follow defeat.  They form part of that\npatrimony of illusions left us by our fathers, whose power is\noften greater than that of reality.  The dream, the ideal, the\nlegend--in a word, the unreal--it is that which shapes history.\n\n\nPART I\n\nTHE PSYCHOLOGICAL ELEMENTS OF REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS\n\n\n\nBOOK I\n\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF REVOLUTIONS\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nSCIENTIFIC AND POLITICAL REVOLUTIONS\n\n1.  Classification of Revolutions.\n\nWe generally apply the term revolution to sudden political\nchanges, but the expression may be employed to denote all sudden\ntransformations, or transformations apparently sudden, whether of\nbeliefs, ideas, or doctrines.\n\nWe have considered elsewhere the part played by the rational,\naffective, and mystic factors in the genesis of the opinions and\nbeliefs which determine conduct.  We need not therefore return to\nthe subject here.\n\nA revolution may finally become a belief, but it often commences\nunder the action of perfectly rational motives: the suppression\nof crying abuses, of a detested despotic government, or an\nunpopular sovereign, &c.\n\nAlthough the origin of a revolution may be perfectly rational, we\nmust not forget that the reasons invoked in preparing for it do\nnot influence the crowd until they have been transformed\ninto sentiments.  Rational logic can point to the abuses to be\ndestroyed, but to move the multitude its hopes must be awakened.\nThis can only be effected by the action of the affective and\nmystic elements which give man the power to act.  At the time of\nthe French Revolution, for example, rational logic, in the hands\nof the philosophers, demonstrated the inconveniences of the\nancien regime, and excited the desire to change it.  Mystic\nlogic inspired belief in the virtues of a society created in all\nits members according to certain principles.  Affective logic\nunchained the passions confined by the bonds of ages and led to\nthe worst excesses.  Collective logic ruled the clubs and the\nAssemblies and impelled their members to actions which neither\nrational nor affective nor mystic logic would ever have caused\nthem to commit.\n\nWhatever its origin, a revolution is not productive of results\nuntil it has sunk into the soul of the multitude.  Then events\nacquire special forms resulting from the peculiar psychology of\ncrowds.  Popular movements for this reason have characteristics\nso pronounced that the description of one will enable us to\ncomprehend the others.\n\nThe multitude is, therefore, the agent of a revolution; but not\nits point of departure.  The crowd represents an amorphous being\nwhich can do nothing, and will nothing, without a head to lead\nit.  It will quickly exceed the impulse once received, but it\nnever creates it.\n\nThe sudden political revolutions which strike the historian most\nforcibly are often the least important.  The great revolutions\nare those of manners and thought.  Changing the name of a\ngovernment does not transform the mentality of a people.  To\noverthrow the institutions of a people is not to re-shape its\nsoul.\n\nThe true revolutions, those which transform the destinies of the\npeoples, are most frequently accomplished so slowly that the\nhistorians can hardly point to their beginnings.  The term\nevolution is, therefore, far more appropriate than revolution.\n\nThe various elements we have enumerated as entering into the\ngenesis of the majority of revolutions will not suffice to\nclassify them.  Considering only the designed object, we will\ndivide them into scientific revolutions, political revolutions,\nand religious revolutions.\n\n2.  Scientific Revolutions.\n\n\nScientific revolutions are by far the most important.  Although\nthey attract but little attention, they are often fraught with\nremote consequences, such as are not engendered by political\nrevolutions.  We will therefore put them first, although we\ncannot study them here.\n\nFor instance, if our conceptions of the universe have profoundly\nchanged since the time of the Revolution, it is because\nastronomical discoveries and the application of experimental\nmethods have revolutionised them, by demonstrating that\nphenomena, instead of being conditioned by the caprices of the\ngods, are ruled by invariable laws.\n\nSuch revolutions are fittingly spoken of as evolution, on account\nof their slowness.  But there are others which, although of the\nsame order, deserve the name of revolution by reason of their\nrapidity: we may instance the theories of Darwin,\noverthrowing the whole science of biology in a few years; the\ndiscoveries of Pasteur, which revolutionised medicine during the\nlifetime of their author; and the theory of the dissociation of\nmatter, proving that the atom, formerly supposed to be eternal,\nis not immune from the laws which condemn all the elements of the\nuniverse to decline and perish.\n\nThese scientific revolutions in the domain of ideas are purely\nintellectual.  Our sentiments and beliefs do not affect them.\nMen submit to them without discussing them.  Their results being\ncontrollable by experience, they escape all criticism.\n\n\n3.  Political Revolutions.\n\n\nBeneath and very remote from these scientific revolutions, which\ngenerate the progress of civilisations, are the religious and\npolitical revolutions, which have no kinship with them.  While\nscientific revolutions derive solely from rational elements,\npolitical and religious beliefs are sustained almost exclusively\nby affective and mystic factors.  Reason plays only a feeble part\nin their genesis.\n\nI insisted at some length in my book Opinions and Beliefs on\nthe affective and mystic origin of beliefs, showing that a\npolitical or religious belief constitutes an act of faith\nelaborated in unconsciousness, over which, in spite of all\nappearances, reason has no hold.  I also showed that belief often\nreaches such a degree of intensity that nothing can be opposed to\nit.  The man hypnotised by his faith becomes an Apostle, ready to\nsacrifice his interests, his happiness, and even his life for the\ntriumph of his faith.  The absurdity of his belief matters\nlittle; for him it is a burning reality.  Certitudes of mystic\norigin possess the marvellous power of entire domination over\nthought, and can only be affected by time.\n\nBy the very fact that it is regarded as an absolute truth a\nbelief necessarily becomes intolerant.  This explains the\nviolence, hatred, and persecution which were the habitual\naccompaniments of the great political and religious revolutions,\nnotably of the Reformation and the French Revolution.\n\nCertain periods of French history remain incomprehensible if we\nforget the affective and mystic origin of beliefs, their\nnecessary intolerance, the impossibility of reconciling them when\nthey come into mutual contact, and, finally, the power conferred\nby mystic beliefs upon the sentiments which place themselves at\ntheir service.\n\nThe foregoing conceptions are too novel as yet to have modified\nthe mentality of the historians.  They will continue to attempt\nto explain, by means of rational logic, a host of phenomena which\nare foreign to it.\n\nEvents such as the Reformation, which overwhelmed France for a\nperiod of fifty years, were in no wise determined by rational\ninfluences.  Yet rational influences are always invoked in\nexplanation, even in the most recent works.  Thus, in the\nGeneral History of Messrs. Lavisse and Rambaud, we read the\nfollowing explanation of the Reformation:--\n\n``It was a spontaneous movement, born here and there amidst the\npeople, from the reading of the Gospels and the free individual\nreflections which were suggested to simple persons by an\nextremely pious conscience and a very bold reasoning power.''\n\nContrary to the assertion of these historians, we may say with\ncertainty, in the first place, that such movements are never\nspontaneous, and secondly, that reason takes no part in their\nelaboration.\n\nThe force of the political and religious beliefs which have moved\nthe world resides precisely in the fact that, being born of\naffective and mystic elements, they are neither created nor\ndirected by reason.\n\nPolitical or religious beliefs have a common origin and obey the\nsame laws.  They are formed not with the aid of reason, but more\noften contrary to all reason.  Buddhism, Islamism, the\nReformation, Jacobinism, Socialism, &c., seem very different\nforms of thought.  Yet they have identical affective and mystic\nbases, and obey a logic that has no affinity with rational logic.\n\nPolitical revolutions may result from beliefs established in the\nminds of men, but many other causes produce them.  The word\ndiscontent sums them up.  As soon as discontent is generalised a\nparty is formed which often becomes strong enough to struggle\nagainst the Government.\n\nDiscontent must generally have been accumulating for a long time\nin order to produce its effects.  For this reason a revolution\ndoes not always represent a phenomenon in process of termination\nfollowed by another which is commencing but rather a continuous\nphenomenon, having somewhat accelerated its evolution.  All the\nmodern revolutions, however, have been abrupt movements,\nentailing the instantaneous overthrow of governments.  Such, for\nexample, were the Brazilian, Portuguese, Turkish, and Chinese\nrevolutions.\n\nTo the contrary of what might be supposed, the very conservative\npeoples are addicted to the most violent revolutions.  Being\nconservative, they are not able to evolve slowly, or to adapt\nthemselves to variations of environment, so that when the\ndiscrepancy becomes too extreme they are bound to adapt\nthemselves suddenly.  This sudden evolution constitutes a\nrevolution.\n\nPeoples able to adapt themselves progressively do not always\nescape revolution.  It was only by means of a revolution that the\nEnglish, in 1688, were able to terminate the struggle which had\ndragged on for a century between the monarchy, which sought to\nmake itself absolute, and the nation, which claimed the right to\ngovern itself through the medium of its representatives.\n\nThe great revolutions have usually commenced from the top, not\nfrom the bottom; but once the people is unchained it is to the\npeople that revolution owes its might.\n\nIt is obvious that revolutions have never taken place, and will\nnever take place, save with the aid of an important fraction of\nthe army.  Royalty did not disappear in France on the day when\nLouis XVI. was guillotined, but at the precise moment when his\nmutinous troops refused to defend him.\n\nIt is more particularly by mental contagion that armies become\ndisaffected, being indifferent enough at heart to the established\norder of things.  As soon as the coalition of a few officers had\nsucceeded in overthrowing the Turkish Government the Greek\nofficers thought to imitate them and to change their government,\nalthough there was no analogy between the two regimes.\n\nA military movement may overthrow a government--and in the\nSpanish republics the Government is hardly ever destroyed by any\nother means--but if the revolution is to be productive of great\nresults it must always be based upon general discontent and\ngeneral hopes.\n\nUnless it is universal and excessive, discontent alone is not\nsufficient to bring about a revolution.  It is easy to lead a\nhandful of men to pillage, destroy, and massacre, but to raise a\nwhole people, or any great portion of that people, calls for the\ncontinuous or repeated action of leaders.  These exaggerate the\ndiscontent; they persuade the discontented that the government is\nthe sole cause of all the trouble, especially of the prevailing\ndearth, and assure men that the new system proposed by them will\nengender an age of felicity.  These ideas germinate, propagating\nthemselves by suggestion and contagion, and the moment arrives\nwhen the revolution is ripe.\n\nIn this fashion the Christian Revolution and the French\nRevolution were prepared.  That the latter was effected in a few\nyears, while the first required many, was due to the fact that\nthe French Revolution promptly had an armed force at its\ndisposal, while Christianity was long in winning material power.\nIn the beginning its only adepts were the lowly, the poor, and\nthe slaves, filled with enthusiasm by the prospect of seeing\ntheir miserable life transformed into an eternity of delight.  By\na phenomenon of contagion from below, of which history affords us\nmore than one example, the doctrine finally invaded the upper\nstrata of the nation, but it was a long time before an\nemperor considered the new faith sufficiently widespread to be\nadopted as the official religion.\n\n\n4.  The Results of Political Revolutions.\n\n\nWhen a political party is triumphant it naturally seeks to\norganise society in accordance with its interests.  The\norganisation will differ accordingly as the revolution has been\neffected by the soldiers, the Radicals, or the Conservatives, &c.\n\nThe new laws and institutions will depend on the interests of the\ntriumphant party and of the classes which have assisted it--the\nclergy for instance.\n\nIf the revolution has triumphed only after a violent struggle, as\nwas the case with the French Revolution, the victors will reject\nat one sweep the whole arsenal of the old law.  The supporters of\nthe fallen regime will be persecuted, exiled, or exterminated.\n\nThe maximum of violence in these persecutions is attained when\nthe triumphant party is defending a belief in addition to its\nmaterial interests.  Then the conquered need hope for no pity.\nThus may be explained the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, the\nautodafes of the Inquisition, the executions of the\nConvention, and the recent laws against the religious\ncongregations in France.\n\nThe absolute power which is assumed by the victors leads them\nsometimes to extreme measures, such as the Convention's decree\nthat gold was to be replaced by paper, that goods were to be sold\nat determined prices, &c.  Very soon it runs up against a wall of\nunavoidable necessities, which turn opinion against its tyranny,\nand finally leave it defenceless before attack, as befell at the\nend of the French Revolution.  The same thing happened\nrecently to a Socialist Australian ministry composed almost\nexclusively of working-men.  It enacted laws so absurd, and\naccorded such privileges to the trade unions, that public opinion\nrebelled against it so unanimously that in three months it was\noverthrown.\n\nBut the cases we have considered are exceptional.  The majority\nof revolutions have been accomplished in order to place a new\nsovereign in power.  Now this sovereign knows very well that the\nfirst condition of maintaining his power consists in not too\nexclusively favouring a single class, but in seeking to\nconciliate all.  To do this he will establish a sort of\nequilibrium between them, so as not to be dominated by any one of\nthese classes.  To allow one class to become predominant is to\ncondemn himself presently to accept that class as his master.\nThis law is one of the most certain of political psychology.  The\nkings of France understood it very well when they struggled so\nenergetically against the encroachments first of the nobility and\nthen of the clergy.  If they had not done so their fate would\nhave been that of the German Emperors of the Middle Ages, who,\nexcommunicated by the Pope, were reduced, like Henry IV. at\nCanossa, to make a pilgrimage and humbly to sue for the Pope's\nforgiveness.\n\nThis same law has continually been verified during the course of\nhistory.  When at the end of the Roman Empire the military caste\nbecame preponderant, the emperors depended entirely upon their\nsoldiers, who appointed and deposed them at will.\n\nIt was therefore a great advantage for France that she was so\nlong governed by a monarch almost absolute, supposed to\nhold his power by divine right, and surrounded therefore by a\nconsiderable prestige.  Without such an authority he could have\ncontrolled neither the feudal nobility, nor the clergy, nor the\nparliaments.  If Poland, towards the end of the sixteenth\ncentury, had also possessed an absolute and respected monarchy,\nshe would not have descended the path of decadence which led to\nher disappearance from the map of Europe.\n\nWe have shewn in this chapter that political revolutions may be\naccompanied by important social transformations.  We shall soon\nsee how slight are these transformations compared to those\nproduced by religious revolutions.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nRELIGIOUS REVOLUTIONS\n\n1.  The importance of the study of Religious Revolutions in\nrespect of the comprehension of the great Political Revolutions.\n\n\nA portion of this work will be devoted to the French Revolution.\nIt was full of acts of violence which naturally had their\npsychological causes.\n\nThese exceptional events will always fill us with astonishment,\nand we even feel them to be inexplicable.  They become\ncomprehensible, however, if we consider that the French\nRevolution, constituting a new religion, was bound to obey the\nlaws which condition the propagation of all beliefs.  Its fury\nand its hecatombs will then become intelligible.\n\nIn studying the history of a great religious revolution, that of\nthe Reformation, we shall see that a number of psychological\nelements which figured therein were equally active during the\nFrench Revolution.  In both we observe the insignificant bearing\nof the rational value of a belief upon its propagation, the\ninefficacy of persecution, the impossibility of tolerance between\ncontrary beliefs, and the violence and the desperate struggles\nresulting from the conflict of different faiths.  We also observe\nthe exploitation of a belief by interests quite independent\nof that belief.  Finally we see that it is impossible to modify\nthe convictions of men without also modifying their existence.\n\nThese phenomena verified, we shall see plainly why the gospel of\nthe Revolution was propagated by the same methods as all the\nreligious gospels, notably that of Calvin.  It could not have\nbeen propagated otherwise.\n\nBut although there are close analogies between the genesis of a\nreligious revolution, such as the Reformation, and that of a\ngreat political revolution like our own, their remote\nconsequences are very different, which explains the difference of\nduration which they display.  In religious revolutions no\nexperience can reveal to the faithful that they are deceived,\nsince they would have to go to heaven to make the discovery.  In\npolitical revolutions experience quickly demonstrates the error\nof a false doctrine and forces men to abandon it.\n\nThus at the end of the Directory the application of Jacobin\nbeliefs had led France to such a degree of ruin, poverty, and\ndespair that the wildest Jacobins themselves had to renounce\ntheir system.  Nothing survived of their theories except a few\nprinciples which cannot be verified by experience, such as the\nuniversal happiness which equality should bestow upon humanity.\n\n\n2.  The beginnings of the Reformation and its first disciples.\n\n\nThe Reformation was finally to exercise a profound influence upon\nthe sentiments and moral ideas of a great proportion of mankind.\nModest in its beginnings, it was at first a simple struggle\nagainst the abuses of the clergy, and, from a practical point of\nview, a return to the prescriptions of the Gospel.  It never\nconstituted, as has been claimed, an aspiration towards freedom\nof thought.  Calvin was as intolerant as Robespierre, and all the\ntheorists of the age considered that the religion of subjects\nmust be that of the prince who governed them.  Indeed in every\ncountry where the Reformation was established the sovereign\nreplaced the Pope of Rome, with the same rights and the same\npowers.\n\nIn France, in default of publicity and means of communication,\nthe new faith spread slowly enough at first.  It was about 1520\nthat Luther recruited a few adepts, and only towards 1535 was the\nnew belief sufficiently widespread for men to consider it\nnecessary to burn its disciples.\n\nIn conformity with a well-known psychological law, these\nexecutions merely favoured the propagation of the Reformation.\nIts first followers included priests and magistrates, but were\nprincipally obscure artisans.  Their conversion was effected\nalmost exclusively by mental contagion and suggestion.\n\nAs soon as a new belief extends itself, we see grouped round it\nmany persons who are indifferent to the belief, but who find in\nit a pretext or opportunity for gratifying their passions or\ntheir greed.  This phenomenon was observed at the time of the\nReformation in many countries, notably in Germany and in England.\n\nLuther having taught that the clergy had no need of wealth, the\nGerman lords found many merits in a faith which enabled them to\nseize upon the goods of the Church.  Henry VIII. enriched\nhimself by a similar operation.  Sovereigns who were often\nmolested by the Pope could as a rule only look favourably upon a\ndoctrine which added religious powers to their political powers\nand made each of them a Pope.  Far from diminishing the\nabsolutism of rulers, the Reformation only exaggerated it.\n\n\n3.  Rational value of the doctrines of the Reformation.\n\n\nThe Reformation overturned all Europe, and came near to ruining\nFrance, of which it made a battle-field for a period of fifty\nyears.  Never did a cause so insignificant from the rational\npoint of view produce such great results.\n\nHere is one of the innumerable proofs of the fact that beliefs\nare propagated independently of all reason.  The theological\ndoctrines which aroused men's passions so violently, and notably\nthose of Calvin, are not even worthy of examination in the light\nof rational logic.\n\nGreatly concerned about his salvation, having an excessive fear\nof the devil, which his confessor was unable to allay, Luther\nsought the surest means of pleasing God that he might avoid Hell.\n\nHaving commenced by denying the Pope the right to sell\nindulgences, he presently entirely denied his authority, and that\nof the Church, condemned religious ceremonies, confession, and\nthe worship of the saints, and declared that Christians should\nhave no rules of conduct other than the Bible.  He also\nconsidered that no one could be saved without the grace of God.\n\nThis last theory, known as that of predestination, was in Luther\nrather uncertain, but was stated precisely by Calvin, who made it\nthe very foundation of a doctrine to which the majority of\nProtestants are still subservient.  According to him: ``From\nall eternity God has predestined certain men to be burned and\nothers to be saved.''  Why this monstrous iniquity?  Simply\nbecause ``it is the will of God.''\n\nThus according to Calvin, who for that matter merely developed\ncertain assertions of St. Augustine, an all-powerful God would\namuse Himself by creating living beings simply in order to burn\nthem during all eternity, without paying any heed to their acts\nor merits.  It is marvellous that such revolting insanity could\nfor such a length of time subjugate so many minds--marvellous\nthat it does so still.[1]\n\n\n\n[1] The doctrine of predestination is still taught in Protestant\ncatechisms, as is proved by the following passage extracted from\nthe last edition of an official catechism for which I sent to\nEdinburgh:\n\n``By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some\nmen and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life, and\nothers foreordained to everlasting death.\n\n``These angels and men, thus predestinated and foreordained, are\nparticularly and unchangeably designed; and their number is so\ncertain and definite that it cannot be either increased or\ndiminished.\n\n``Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God, before\nthe foundation of the world was laid, according to His eternal\nand immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure\nof His will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, out of\nHis mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or\ngood works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing\nin the creature, as conditions, or causes moving him thereunto;\nand all to the praise of his glorious grace.\n\n``As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath He, by the\neternal and most free purpose of His will, foreordained all the\nmeans thereunto.  Wherefore they who are elected being fallen in\nAdam, are redeemed by Christ; are effectually called unto faith\nin Christ by His spirit working in due season; are justified,\nadopted, sanctified, and kept by His power through faith unto\nsalvation.  Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually\ncalled, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect\nonly.''\n\n\n\nThe psychology of Calvin is not without affinity with that of\nRobespierre.  Like the latter, the master of the pure truth, he\nsent to death those who would not accept his doctrines.  God, he\nstated, wishes ``that one should put aside all humanity when it\nis a question of striving for his glory.''\n\nThe case of Calvin and his disciples shows that matters which\nrationally are the most contradictory become perfectly reconciled\nin minds which are hypnotised by a belief.  In the eyes of\nrational logic, it seems impossible to base a morality upon the\ntheory of predestination, since whatever they do men are sure of\nbeing either saved or damned.  However, Calvin had no difficulty\nin erecting a most severe morality upon this totally illogical\nbasis.  Considering themselves the elect of God, his disciples\nwere so swollen by pride and the sense of their own dignity that\nthey felt obliged to serve as models in their conduct.\n\n\n4.  Propagation of the Reformation.\n\n\nThe new faith was propagated not by speech, still less by process\nof reasoning, but by the mechanism described in our preceding\nwork: that is, by the influence of affirmation, repetition,\nmental contagion, and prestige.  At a much later date\nrevolutionary ideas were spread over France in the same fashion.\n\nPersecution, as we have already remarked, only favoured this\npropagation.  Each execution led to fresh conversions, as was\nseen in the early years of the Christian Church.  Anne Dubourg,\nParliamentary councillor, condemned to be burned alive, marched\nto the stake exhorting the crowd to be converted.  ``His\nconstancy,'' says a witness, ``made more Protestants among the\nyoung men of the colleges than the books of Calvin.''\n\nTo prevent the condemned from speaking to the people their\ntongues were cut out before they were burned.  The horror of\ntheir sufferings was increased by attaching the victims to an\niron chain, which enabled the executioners to plunge them into\nthe fire and withdraw them several times in succession.\n\nBut nothing induced the Protestants to retract, even the offer of\nan amnesty after they had felt the fire.\n\nIn 1535 Francis I., forsaking his previous tolerance, ordered six\nfires to be lighted simultaneously in Paris.  The Convention, as\nwe know, limited itself to a single guillotine in the same city.\nIt is probable that the sufferings of the victims were not very\nexcruciating; the insensibility of the Christian martyrs had\nalready been remarked.  Believers are hypnotised by their faith,\nand we know to-day that certain forms of hypnotism engender\ncomplete insensibility.\n\nThe new faith progressed rapidly.  In 1560 there were two\nthousand reformed churches in France, and many great lords, at\nfirst indifferent enough, adhered to the new doctrine.\n\n\n5.  Conflict between different religious beliefs--Impossibility\nof Tolerance.\n\n\nI have already stated that intolerance is always an accompaniment\nof powerful religious beliefs.  Political and religious\nrevolutions furnish us with numerous proofs of this fact, and\nshow us also that the mutual intolerance of sectaries of the same\nreligion is always much greater than that of the defenders\nof remote and alien faiths, such as Islamism and Christianity.\nIn fact, if we consider the faiths for whose sake France was so\nlong rent asunder, we shall find that they did not differ on any\nbut accessory points.  Catholics and Protestants adored exactly\nthe same God, and only differed in their manner of adoring Him.\nIf reason had played the smallest part in the elaboration of\ntheir belief, it could easily have proved to them that it must be\nquite indifferent to God whether He sees men adore Him in this\nfashion or in that.\n\nReason being powerless to affect the brain of the convinced,\nProtestants and Catholics continued their ferocious conflicts.\nAll the efforts of their sovereigns to reconcile them were in\nvain.  Catherine de Medicis, seeing the party of the Reformed\nChurch increasing day by day in spite of persecution, and\nattracting a considerable number of nobles and magistrates,\nthought to disarm them by convoking at Poissy, in 1561, an\nassembly of bishops and pastors with the object of fusing the two\ndoctrines.  Such an enterprise indicated that the queen, despite\nher subtlety, knew nothing of the laws of mystic logic.  Not in\nall history can one cite an example of a belief destroyed or\nreduced by means of refutation.  Catherine did not even know that\nalthough toleration is with difficulty possible between\nindividuals, it is impossible between collectivities.  Her\nattempt failed completely.  The assembled theologians hurled\ntexts and insults at one another's heads, but no one was moved.\nCatherine thought to succeed better in 1562 by promulgating an\nedict according Protestants the right to unite in the public\ncelebration of their cult.\n\nThis tolerance, very admirable from a philosophical point of\nview, but not at all wise from the political standpoint, had no\nother result beyond exasperating both parties.  In the Midi,\nwhere the Protestants were strongest, they persecuted the\nCatholics, sought to convert them by violence, cut their throats\nif they did not succeed, and sacked their cathedrals.  In the\nregions where the Catholics were more numerous the Reformers\nsuffered like persecutions.\n\nSuch hostilities as these inevitably engendered civil war.  Thus\narose the so-called religious wars, which so long spilled the\nblood of France.  The cities were ravaged, the inhabitants\nmassacred, and the struggle rapidly assumed that special quality\nof ferocity peculiar to religious or political conflicts, which,\nat a later date, was to reappear in the wars of La Vendee.\n\nOld men, women, and children, all were exterminated.  A certain\nBaron d'Oppede, first president of the Parliament of Aix, had\nalready set an example by killing 3,000 persons in the space of\nten days, with refinements of cruelty, and destroying three\ncities and twenty-two villages.  Montluc, a worthy forerunner of\nCarrier, had the Calvinists thrown living into the wells until\nthese were full.  The Protestants were no more humane.  They did\nnot spare even the Catholic churches, and treated the tombs and\nstatues just as the delegates of the Convention were to treat the\nroyal tombs of Saint Denis.\n\nUnder the influence of these conflicts France was progressively\ndisintegrated, and at the end of the reign of Henri III. was\nparcelled out into veritable little confederated municipal\nrepublics, forming so many sovereign states.  The royal power was\nvanishing.  The States of Blois claimed to dictate their wishes\nto Henri III., who had fled from his capital.  In 1577 the\ntraveller Lippomano, who traversed France, saw important cities--\nOrleans, Tours, Blois, Poitiers--entirely devastated, the\ncathedrals and churches in ruins, and the tombs shattered.  This\nwas almost the state of France at the end of the Directory.\n\nAmong the events of this epoch, that which has left the darkest\nmemory, although it was not perhaps the most murderous, was the\nmassacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572, ordered, according to the\nhistorians, by Catherine de Medicis and Charles IX.\n\nOne does not require a very profound knowledge of psychology to\nrealise that no sovereign could have ordered such an event.  St.\nBartholomew's Day was not a royal but a popular crime.  Catherine\nde Medicis, believing her existence and that of the king\nthreatened by a plot directed by four or five Protestant leaders\nthen in Paris, sent men to kill them in their houses, according\nto the summary fashion of the time.  The massacre which followed\nis very well explained by M. Battifol in the following terms:--\n\n``At the report of what was afoot the rumour immediately ran\nthrough Paris that the Huguenots were being massacred; Catholic\ngentlemen, soldiers of the guard, archers, men of the people, in\nshort all Paris, rushed into the streets, arms in hand, in order\nto participate in the execution, and the general massacre\ncommenced, to the sound of ferocious cries of `The\nHuguenots! Kill, kill!'  They were struck down, they were\ndrowned, they were hanged.  All that were known as heretics were\nso served.  Two thousand persons were killed in Paris.''\n\nBy contagion, the people of the provinces imitated those of\nParis, and six to eight thousand Protestants were slain.\n\nWhen time had somewhat cooled religious passions, all the\nhistorians, even the Catholics, spoke of St. Bartholomew's Day\nwith indignation.  They thus showed how difficult it is for the\nmentality of one epoch to understand that of another.\n\nFar from being criticised, St. Bartholomew's Day provoked an\nindescribable enthusiasm throughout the whole of Catholic Europe.\n\nPhilip II. was delirious with joy when he heard the news, and the\nKing of France received more congratulations than if he had won a\ngreat battle.\n\nBut it was Pope Gregory XIII. above all who manifested the\nkeenest satisfaction.  He had a medal struck to commemorate the\nhappy event,[2] ordered joy-fires to be lit and cannon fired,\ncelebrated several masses, and sent for the painter Vasari to\ndepict on the walls of the Vatican the principal scenes of\ncarnage.  Further, he sent to the King of France an ambassador\ninstructed to felicitate that monarch upon his fine action.  It\nis historical details of this kind that enable us to comprehend\nthe mind of the believer.  The Jacobins of the Terror had a\nmentality very like that of Gregory XIII.\n\n\n\n[2] The medal must have been distributed pretty widely, for the\ncabinet of medals at the Bibliotheque Nationale possesses\nthree examples: one in gold, one in silver, and one in copper.\nThis medal, reproduced by Bonnani in his Numism. Pontific.\n(vol. i. p. 336), represents on one side Gregory XIII., and on\nthe other an angel striking Huguenots with a sword.  The exergue\nis Ugonotorum strages, that is, Massacre of the Huguenots.\n(The word strages may be translated by carnage or massacre, a\nsense which it possesses in Cicero and Livy; or again by\ndisaster, ruin, a sense attributed to it in Virgil and Tacitus.)\n\n\n\nNaturally the Protestants were not indifferent to such a\nhecatomb, and they made such progress that in 1576 Henri III. was\nreduced to granting them, by the Edict of Beaulieu, entire\nliberty of worship, eight strong places, and, in the Parliaments,\nChambers composed half of Catholics and half of Huguenots.\n\nThese forced concessions did not lead to peace.  A Catholic\nLeague was created, having the Duke of Guise at its head, and the\nconflict continued.  But it could not last for ever.  We know how\nHenri IV. put an end to it, at least for a time, by his\nabjuration in 1593, and by the Edict of Nantes.\n\nThe struggle was quieted but not terminated.  Under Louis XIII.\nthe Protestants were still restless, and in 1627 Richelieu was\nobliged to besiege La Rochelle, where 15,000 Protestants\nperished.  Afterwards, possessing more political than religious\nfeeling, the famous Cardinal proved extremely tolerant toward the\nReformers.\n\nThis tolerance could not last.  Contrary beliefs cannot come into\ncontact without seeking to annihilate each other, as soon as one\nfeels capable of dominating the other.  Under Louis XIV. the\nProtestants had become by far the weaker, and were forced to\nrenounce the struggle and live at peace.  Their number was then\nabout 1,200,000, and they possessed more than 600 churches,\nserved by about 700 pastors.  The presence of these\nheretics on French soil was intolerable to the Catholic clergy,\nwho endeavoured to persecute them in various ways.  As these\npersecutions had little result, Louis XIV. resorted to\ndragonnading them in 1685, when many individuals perished, but\nwithout further result.  Under the pressure of the clergy,\nnotably of Bossuett, the Edict of Nantes was revoked, and the\nProtestants were forced to accept conversion or to leave France.\nThis disastrous emigration lasted a long time, and is said to\nhave cost France 400,000 inhabitants, men of notable energy,\nsince they had the courage to listen to their conscience rather\nthan their interests.\n\n\n6.  The results of Religious Revolutions.\n\n\nIf religious revolutions were judged only by the gloomy story of\nthe Reformation, we should be forced to regard them as highly\ndisastrous.  But all have not played a like part, the civilising\ninfluence of certain among them being considerable.\n\nBy giving a people moral unity they greatly increase its material\npower.  We see this notably when a new faith, brought by\nMohammed, transforms the petty and impotent tribes of Arabia into\na formidable nation.\n\nSuch a new religious belief does not merely render a people\nhomogeneous.  It attains a result that no philosophy, no code\never attained: it sensibly transforms what is almost\nunchangeable, the sentiments of a race.\n\nWe see this at the period when the most powerful religious\nrevolution recorded by history overthrew paganism to substitute a\nGod who came from the plains of Galilee.  The new ideal demanded\nthe renunciation of all the joys of existence in order to\nacquire the eternal happiness of heaven.  No doubt such an ideal\nwas readily accepted by the poor, the enslaved, the disinherited\nwho were deprived of all the joys of life here below, to whom an\nenchanting future was offered in exchange for a life without\nhope.  But the austere existence so easily embraced by the poor\nwas also embraced by the rich.  In this above all was the power\nof the new faith manifested.\n\nNot only did the Christian revolution transform manners: it also\nexercised, for a space of two thousand years, a preponderating\ninfluence over civilisation.  Directly a religious faith triumphs\nall the elements of civilisation naturally adapt themselves to\nit, so that civilisation is rapidly transformed.  Writers,\nartists and philosophers merely symbolise, in their works, the\nideas of the new faith.\n\nWhen any religious or political faith whatsoever has triumphed,\nnot only is reason powerless to affect it, but it even finds\nmotives which impel it to interpret and so justify the faith in\nquestion, and to strive to impose it upon others.  There were\nprobably as many theologians and orators in the time of Moloch,\nto prove the utility of human sacrifices, as there were at other\nperiods to glorify the Inquisition, the massacre of St.\nBartholomew, and the hecatombs of the Terror.\n\nWe must not hope to see peoples possessed by strong beliefs\nreadily achieve tolerance.  The only people who attained to\ntoleration in the ancient world were the polytheists.  The\nnations which practise toleration at the present time are those\nthat might well be termed polytheistical, since, as in England\nand America, they are divided into innumerable sects.\nUnder identical names they really adore very different deities.\n\nThe multiplicity of beliefs which results in such toleration\nfinally results also in weakness.  We therefore come to a\npsychological problem not hitherto resolved: how to possess a\nfaith at once powerful and tolerant.\n\nThe foregoing brief explanation reveals the large part played by\nreligious revolutions and the power of beliefs.  Despite their\nslight rational value they shape history, and prevent the peoples\nfrom remaining a mass of individuals without cohesion or\nstrength.  Man has needed them at all times to orientate his\nthought and guide his conduct.  No philosophy has as yet\nsucceeded in replacing them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE ACTION OF GOVERNMENTS IN REVOLUTIONS\n\n1.  The feeble resistance of Governments in time of Revolution.\n\nMany modern nations--France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Poland,\nJapan, Turkey, Portugal, &c.--have known revolutions within the\nlast century.  These were usually characterised by their\ninstantaneous quality and the facility with which the governments\nattacked were overthrown.\n\nThe instantaneous nature of these revolutions is explained by the\nrapidity of mental contagion due to modern methods of publicity.\nThe slight resistance of the governments attacked is more\nsurprising.  It implies a total inability to comprehend and\nforesee created by a blind confidence in their own strength.\n\nThe facility with which governments fall is not however a new\nphenomenon.  It has been proved more than once, not only in\nautocratic systems, which are always overturned by palace\nconspiracies, but also in governments perfectly instructed in the\nstate of public opinion by the press and their own agents.\n\nAmong these instantaneous downfalls one of the most striking was\nthat which followed the Ordinances of Charles X.  This monarch\nwas, as we know, overthrown in four days.  His minister\nPolignac had taken no measures of defence, and the king was so\nconfident of the tranquillity of Paris that he had gone hunting.\nThe army was not in the least hostile, as in the reign of Louis\nXVI., but the troops, badly officered, disbanded before the\nattacks of a few insurgents.\n\nThe overthrow of Louis-Philippe was still more typical, since it\ndid not result from any arbitrary action on the part of the\nsovereign.  This monarch was not surrounded by the hatred which\nfinally surrounded Charles X., and his fall was the result of an\ninsignificant riot which could easily have been repressed.\n\nHistorians, who can hardly comprehend how a solidly constituted\ngovernment, supported by an imposing army, can be overthrown by a\nfew rioters, naturally attributed the fall of Louis-Philippe to\ndeep-seated causes.  In reality the incapacity of the generals\nentrusted with his defence was the real cause of his fall.\n\nThis case is one of the most instructive that could be cited, and\nis worthy of a moment's consideration.  It has been perfectly\ninvestigated by General Bonnal, in the light of the notes of an\neye-witness, General Elchingen.  Thirty-six thousand troops were\nthen in Paris, but the weakness and incapacity of their officers\nmade it impossible to use them.  Contradictory orders were given,\nand finally the troops were forbidden to fire on the people, who,\nmoreover--and nothing could have been more dangerous--were\npermitted to mingle with the troops.  The riot succeeded without\nfighting and forced the king to abdicate.\n\nApplying to the preceding case our knowledge of the\npsychology of crowds, General Bonnal shows how easily the riot\nwhich overthrew Louis-Philippe could have been controlled.  He\nproves, notably, that if the commanding officers had not\ncompletely lost their heads quite a small body of troops could\nhave prevented the insurgents from invading the Chamber of\nDeputies.  This last, composed of monarchists, would certainly\nhave proclaimed the Count of Paris under the regency of his\nmother.\n\nSimilar phenomena were observable in the revolutions of Spain and\nPortugal.\n\nThese facts show the role of petty accessory circumstances\nin great events, and prove that one must not speak too readily of\nthe general laws of history.  Without the riot which overthrew\nLouis-Philippe, we should probably have seen neither the Republic\nof 1848, nor the Second Empire, nor Sedan, nor the invasion, nor\nthe loss of Alsace.\n\nIn the revolutions of which I have just been speaking the army\nwas of no assistance to the government, but did not turn against\nit.  It sometimes happens otherwise.  It is often the army which\neffects the revolution, as in Turkey and Portugal.  The\ninnumerable revolutions of the Latin republics of America are\neffected by the army.\n\nWhen a revolution is effected by an army the new rulers naturally\nfall under its domination.  I have already recalled the fact that\nthis was the case at the end of the Roman Empire, when the\nemperors were made and unmade by the soldiery.\n\nThe same thing has sometimes been witnessed in modern times.  The\nfollowing extract from a newspaper, with reference to the\nGreek revolution, shows what becomes of a government dominated by\nits army:--\n\n``One day it was announced that eighty officers of the navy would\nsend in their resignations if the government did not dismiss the\nleaders of whom they complained.  Another time it was the\nagricultural labourers on a farm (metairie) belonging to the\nCrown Prince who demanded the partition of the soil among them.\nThe navy protested against the promotion promised to Colonel\nZorbas.  Colonel Zorbas, after a week of discussion with\nLieutenant Typaldos, treated with the President of the Council as\none power with another.  During this time the Federation of the\ncorporations abused the officers of the navy.  A deputy demanded\nthat these officers and their families should be treated as\nbrigands.  When Commander Miaoulis fired on the rebels, the\nsailors, who first of all had obeyed Typaldos, returned to duty.\nThis is no longer the harmonious Greece of Pericles and\nThemistocles.  It is a hideous camp of Agramant.''\n\nA revolution cannot be effected without the assistance or at\nleast the neutrality of the army, but it often happens that the\nmovement commences without it.  This was the case with the\nrevolutions of 1830 and 1848, and that of 1870, which overthrew\nthe Empire after the humiliation of France by the surrender of\nSedan.\n\nThe majority of revolutions take place in the capitals, and by\nmeans of contagion spread through the country; but this is not a\nconstant rule.  We know that during the French Revolution La\nVendee, Brittany, and the Midi revolted spontaneously against\nParis.\n\n\n2.  How the resistance of Governments may overcome Revolution.\n\n\nIn the greater number of the revolutions enumerated above, we\nhave seen governments perish by their weakness.  As soon as they\nwere touched they fell.\n\nThe Russian Revolution proved that a government which defends\nitself energetically may finally triumph.\n\nNever was revolution more menacing to the government.  After the\ndisasters suffered in the Orient, and the severities of a too\noppressive autocratic regime, all classes of society, including a\nportion of the army and the fleet, had revolted.  The railways,\nposts, and telegraph services had struck, so that communications\nbetween the various portions of the vast empire were interrupted.\n\nThe rural class itself, forming the majority of the nation, began\nto feel the influence of the revolutionary propaganda.  The lot\nof the peasants was wretched.  They were obliged, by the system\nof the mir, to cultivate soil which they could not acquire.  The\ngovernment resolved immediately to conciliate this large class of\npeasants by turning them into proprietors.  Special laws forced\nthe landlords to sell the peasants a portion of their lands, and\nbanks intended to lend the buyers the necessary purchase-money\nwere created.  The sums lent were to be repaid by small annuities\ndeducted from the product of the sale of the crops.\n\nAssured of the neutrality of the peasants, the government could\ncontend with the fanatics who were burning the towns, throwing\nbombs among the crowds, and waging a merciless warfare.  All\nthose who could be taken were killed.  Such extermination is the\nonly method discovered since the beginning of the world by which\na society can be protected against the rebels who wish to destroy\nit.\n\nThe victorious government understood moreover the necessity of\nsatisfying the legitimate claims of the enlightened portion of\nthe nation.  It created a parliament instructed to prepare laws\nand control expenditure.\n\nThe history of the Russian Revolution shows us how a government,\nall of whose natural supports have crumbled in succession, can,\nwith wisdom and firmness, triumph over the most formidable\nobstacles.  It has been very justly said that governments are not\noverthrown, but that they commit suicide.\n\n\n3.  Revolutions effected by Governments.--Examples:\nChina, Turkey, &c.\n\n\nGovernments almost invariably fight revolutions; they hardly ever\ncreate them.  Representing the needs of the moment and general\nopinion, they follow the reformers timidly; they do not precede\nthem.  Sometimes, however, certain governments have attempted\nthose sudden reforms which we know as revolutions.  The stability\nor instability of the national mind decrees the success or\nfailure of such attempts.\n\nThey succeed when the people on whom the government seeks to\nimpose new institutions is composed of semi-barbarous tribes,\nwithout fixed laws, without solid traditions; that is to say,\nwithout a settled national mind.  Such was the condition of\nRussia in the days of Peter the Great.  We know how he sought to\nEuropeanise the semi-Asiatic populations by means of force.\n\nJapan is another example of a revolution effected by a\ngovernment, but it was her machinery, not her mind that was\nreformed.\n\nIt needs a very powerful autocrat, seconded by a man of genius,\nto succeed, even partially, in such a task.  More often than not\nthe reformer finds that the whole people rises up against him.\nThen, to the contrary of what befalls in an ordinary revolution,\nthe autocrat is revolutionary and the people is conservative.\nBut an attentive study will soon show you that the peoples are\nalways extremely conservative.\n\nFailure is the rule with these attempts.  Whether effected by the\nupper classes or the lower, revolutions do not change the souls\nof peoples that have been a long time established.  They only\nchange those things that are worn by time and ready to fall.\n\nChina is at the present time making a very interesting but\nimpossible experiment, in seeking, by means of the government,\nsuddenly to renew the institutions of the country.  The\nrevolution which overturned the dynasty of her ancient sovereigns\nwas the indirect consequence of the discontent provoked by\nreforms which the government had sought to impose with a view to\nameliorating the condition of China.  The suppression of opium\nand gaming, the reform of the army, and the creation of schools,\ninvolved an increase of taxation which, as well as the reforms\nthemselves, greatly indisposed the general opinion.\n\nA few cultured Chinese educated in the schools of Europe profited\nby this discontent to raise the people and proclaim a republic,\nan institution of which the Chinese could have had no conception.\n\nIt surely cannot long survive, for the impulse which has given\nbirth to it is not a movement of progress, but of reaction.  The\nword republic, to the Chinaman intellectualised by his European\neducation, is simply synonymous with the rejection of the yoke of\nlaws, rules, and long-established restraints.  Cutting off his\npigtail, covering his head with a cap, and calling himself a\nRepublican, the young Chinaman thinks to give the rein to all his\ninstincts.  This is more or less the idea of a republic that a\nlarge part of the French people entertained at the time of the\ngreat Revolution.\n\nChina will soon discover the fate that awaits a society deprived\nof the armour slowly wrought by the past.  After a few years of\nbloody anarchy it will be necessary to establish a power whose\ntyranny will inevitably be far severer than that which was\noverthrown.  Science has not yet discovered the magic ring\ncapable of saving a society without discipline.  There is no need\nto impose discipline when it has become hereditary, but when the\nprimitive instincts have been allowed to destroy the barriers\npainfully erected by slow ancestral labours, they cannot be\nreconstituted save by an energetic tyranny.\n\nAs a proof of these assertions we may instance an experiment\nanalogous to that undertaken by China; that recently attempted by\nTurkey.  A few years ago young men instructed in European schools\nand full of good intentions succeeded, with the aid of a\nnumber of officers, in overthrowing a Sultan whose tyranny seemed\ninsupportable.  Having acquired our robust Latin faith in the\nmagic power of formulae, they thought they could establish the\nrepresentative system in a country half-civilised, profoundly\ndivided by religious hatred, and peopled by divers races.\n\nThe attempt has not prospered hitherto.  The authors of the\nreformation had to learn that despite their liberalism they were\nforced to govern by methods very like those employed by the\ngovernment overthrown.  They could neither prevent summary\nexecutions nor wholesale massacres of Christians, nor could they\nremedy a single abuse.\n\nIt would be unjust to reproach them.  What in truth could they\nhave done to change a people whose traditions have been fixed so\nlong, whose religious passions are so intense, and whose\nMohammedans, although in the minority, legitimately claim to\ngovern the sacred city of their faith according to their code?\nHow prevent Islam from remaining the State religion in a country\nwhere civil law and religious law are not yet plainly separated,\nand where faith in the Koran is the only tie by which the idea of\nnationality can be maintained?\n\nIt was difficult to destroy such a state of affairs, so that we\nwere bound to see the re-establishment of an autocratic\norganisation with an appearance of constitutionalism--that is to\nsay, practically the old system once again.  Such attempts afford\na good example of the fact that a people cannot choose its\ninstitutions until it has transformed its mind.\n\n\n4.  Social elements which survive the changes of Government after\nRevolution.\n\n\nWhat we shall say later on as to the stable foundation of the\nnational soul will enable us to appreciate the force of systems\nof government that have been long established, such as ancient\nmonarchies.  A monarch may easily be overthrown by conspirators,\nbut these latter are powerless against the principles which the\nmonarch represents.  Napoleon at his fall was replaced not by his\nnatural heir, but by the heir of kings.  The latter incarnated an\nancient principle, while the son of the Emperor personified ideas\nthat were as yet imperfectly established in men's minds.\n\nFor the same reason a minister, however able, however great the\nservices he has rendered to his country, can very rarely\noverthrow his Sovereign.  Bismarck himself could not have done\nso.  This great minister had single-handed created the unity of\nGermany, yet his master had only to touch him with his finger and\nhe vanished.  A man is as nothing before a principle supported by\nopinion.\n\nBut even when, for various reasons, the principle incarnated by a\ngovernment is annihilated with that government, as happened at\nthe time of the French Revolution, all the elements of social\norganisation do not perish at the same time.\n\nIf we knew nothing of France but the disturbances of the last\nhundred years and more we might suppose the country to live in a\nstate of profound anarchy.  Now her economic, industrial, and\neven her political life manifests, on the contrary, a continuity\nthat seems to be independent of all revolutions and governments.\n\nThe fact is that beside the great events of which history treats\nare the little facts of daily life which the books neglect to\ntell.  They are ruled by imperious necessities which halt for no\nman.  Their total mass forms the real framework of the life of\nthe people.\n\nWhile the study of great events shows us that the nominal\ngovernment of France has been frequently changed in the space of\na century, an examination of the little daily events will prove,\non the contrary, that her real government has been little\naltered.\n\nWho in truth are the real rulers of a people?  Kings and\nministers, no doubt, in the great crises of national life, but\nthey play no part whatever in the little realities which make up\nthe life of every day.  The real directing forces of a country\nare the administrations, composed of impersonal elements which\nare never affected by the changes of government.  Conservative of\ntraditions, they are anonymous and lasting, and constitute an\noccult power before which all others must eventually bow.  Their\naction has even increased to such a degree that, as we shall\npresently show, there is a danger that they may form an anonymous\nState more powerful than the official State.  France has thus\ncome to be governed by heads of departments and government\nclerks.  The more we study the history of revolutions the more we\ndiscover that they change practically nothing but the label.  To\ncreate a revolution is easy, but to change the soul of a people\nis difficult indeed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE PART PLAYED BY THE PEOPLE IN REVOLUTIONS\n\n1.  The stability and malleability of the national mind.\n\nThe knowledge of a people at any given moment of its history\ninvolves an understanding of its environment and above all of its\npast.  Theoretically one may deny that past, as did the men of\nthe Revolution, as many men of the present day have done, but its\ninfluence remains indestructible.\n\nIn the past, built up by slow accumulations of centuries, was\nformed the aggregation of thoughts, sentiments, traditions, and\nprejudices constituting the national mind which makes the\nstrength of a race.  Without it no progress is possible.  Each\ngeneration would necessitate a fresh beginning.\n\nThe aggregate composing the soul of a people is solidly\nestablished only if it possesses a certain rigidity, but this\nrigidity must not pass a certain limit, or there would be no such\nthing as malleability.\n\nWithout rigidity the ancestral soul would have no fixity, and\nwithout malleability it could not adapt itself to the changes of\nenvironment resulting from the progress of civilization.\n\nExcessive malleability of the national mind impels a people to\nincessant revolutions.  Excess of rigidity leads it to\ndecadence.  Living species, like the races of humanity, disappear\nwhen, too fixedly established by a long past, they become\nincapable of adapting themselves to new conditions of existence.\n\nFew peoples have succeeded in effecting a just equilibrium\nbetween these two contrary qualities of stability and\nmalleability.  The Romans in antiquity and the English in modern\ntimes may be cited among those who have best attained it.\n\nThe peoples whose mind is most fixed and established often effect\nthe most violent revolutions.  Not having succeeded in evolving\nprogressively, in adapting themselves to changes of environment,\nthey are forced to adapt themselves violently when such\nadaptation becomes indispensable.\n\nStability is only acquired very slowly.  The history of a race is\nabove all the story of its long efforts to establish its mind.\nSo long as it has not succeeded it forms a horde of barbarians\nwithout cohesion and strength.  After the invasions of the end of\nthe Roman Empire France took several centuries to form a national\nsoul.\n\nShe finally achieved one; but in the course of centuries this\nsoul finally became too rigid.  With a little more malleability,\nthe ancient monarchy would have been slowly transformed as it was\nelsewhere, and we should have avoided, together with the\nRevolution and its consequences, the heavy task of remaking a\nnational soul.\n\nThe preceding considerations show us the part of race in the\ngenesis of revolutions, and explain why the same revolutions will\nproduce such different effects in different countries; why, for\nexample, the ideas of the French Revolution, welcomed with\nsuch enthusiasm by some peoples, were rejected by others.\n\nCertainly England, although a very stable country, has suffered\ntwo revolutions and slain a king; but the mould of her mental\narmour was at once stable enough to retain the acquisitions of\nthe past and malleable enough to modify them only within the\nnecessary limits.  Never did England dream, as did the men of the\nFrench Revolution, of destroying the ancestral heritage in order\nto erect a new society in the name of reason.\n\n``While the Frenchman,'' writes M. A. Sorel, ``despised his\ngovernment, detested his clergy, hated the nobility, and revolted\nagainst the laws, the Englishman was proud of his religion, his\nconstitution, his aristocracy, his House of Lords.  These were\nlike so many towers of the formidable Bastille in which he\nentrenched himself, under the British standard, to judge Europe\nand cover her with contempt.  He admitted that the command was\ndisputed inside the fort, but no stranger must approach.''\n\nThe influence of race in the destiny of the peoples appears\nplainly in the history of the perpetual revolutions of the\nSpanish republics of South America.  Composed of half-castes,\nthat is to say, of individuals whose diverse heredities have\ndissociated their ancestral characteristics, these populations\nhave no national soul and therefore no stability.  A people of\nhalf-castes is always ungovernable.\n\nIf we would learn more of the differences of political capacity\nwhich the racial factor creates we must examine the same nation\nas governed by two races successively.\n\nThe event is not rare in history.  It has been manifested in a\nstriking manner of late in Cuba and the Philippines, which passed\nsuddenly from the rule of Spain to that of the United States.\n\nWe know in what anarchy and poverty Cuba existed under Spanish\nrule; we know, too, to what a degree of prosperity the island was\nbrought in a few years when it fell into the hands of the United\nStates.\n\nThe same experience was repeated in the Philippines, which for\ncenturies had been governed by Spain.  Finally the country was no\nmore than a vast jungle, the home of epidemics of every kind,\nwhere a miserable population vegetated without commerce or\nindustry.  After a few years of American rule the country was\nentirely transformed: malaria, yellow fever, plague and cholera\nhad entirely disappeared.  The swamps were drained; the country\nwas covered with railways, factories and schools.  In thirteen\nyears the mortality was reduced by two-thirds.\n\nIt is to such examples that we must refer the theorist who has\nnot yet grasped the profound significance of the word race, and\nhow far the ancestral soul of a people rules over its destiny.\n\n\n2.  How the people regards Revolution.\n\n\nThe part of the people has been the same in all revolutions.  It\nis never the people that conceives them nor directs them.  Its\nactivity is released by means of leaders.\n\nOnly when the direct interests of the people are involved do we\nsee, as recently in Champagne, any fraction of the people rising\nspontaneously.  A movement thus localised constitutes a mere\nriot.\n\nRevolution is easy when the leaders are very influential.  Of\nthis Portugal and Brazil have recently furnished proofs.  But new\nideas penetrate the people very slowly indeed.  Generally it\naccepts a revolution without knowing why, and when by chance it\ndoes succeed in understanding why, the revolution is over long\nago.\n\nThe people will create a revolution because it is persuaded to do\nso, but it does not understand very much of the ideas of its\nleaders; it interprets them in its own fashion, and this fashion\nis by no means that of the true authors of the revolution.  The\nFrench Revolution furnished a striking example of this fact.\n\nThe Revolution of 1789 had as its real object the substitution of\nthe power of the nobility by that of the bourgeoisie; that is,\nan old elite which had become incapable was to be replaced\nby a new elite which did possess capacity.\n\nThere was little question of the people in this first phase of\nthe Revolution.  The sovereignty of the people was proclaimed,\nbut it amounted only to the right of electing its\nrepresentatives.\n\nExtremely illiterate, not hoping, like the middle classes, to\nascend the social scale, not in any way feeling itself the equal\nof the nobles, and not aspiring ever to become their equal, the\npeople had views and interests very different to those of the\nupper classes of society.\n\nThe struggles of the assembly with the royal power led it to call\nfor the intervention of the people in these struggles.  It\nintervened more and more, and the bourgeois revolution rapidly\nbecame a popular revolution.\n\nAn idea having no force of its own, and acting only by virtue of\npossessing an affective and mystic substratum which supports it,\nthe theoretical ideas of the bourgeoisie, before they could act\non the people, had to be transformed into a new and very definite\nfaith, springing from obvious practical interests.\n\nThis transformation was rapidly effected when the people heard\nthe men envisaged by it as the Government assuring it that it was\nthe equal of its former masters.  It began to regard itself as a\nvictim, and proceeded to pillage, burn, and massacre, imagining\nthat in so doing it was exercising a right.\n\nThe great strength of the revolutionary principles was that they\ngave a free course to the instincts of primitive barbarity which\nhad been restrained by the secular and inhibitory action of\nenvironment, tradition, and law.\n\nAll the social bonds that formerly contained the multitude were\nday by day dissolving, so that it conceived a notion of unlimited\npower, and the joy of seeing its ancient masters ferreted out and\ndespoiled.  Having become the sovereign people, were not all\nthings permissible to it?\n\nThe motto of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, a true manifestation\nof hope and faith at the beginning of the Revolution, soon merely\nserved to cover a legal justification of the sentiments of\njealousy, cupidity, and hatred of superiors, the true motives of\ncrowds unrestrained by discipline.  This is why the Revolution so\nsoon ended in disorder, violence, and anarchy.\n\nFrom the moment when the Revolution descended from the middle to\nthe lower classes of society, it ceased to be a domination of the\ninstinctive by the rational, and became, on the contrary,\nthe effort of the instinctive to overpower the rational.\n\nThis legal triumph of the atavistic instincts was terrible.  The\nwhole effort of societies an effort indispensable to their\ncontinued existence--had always been to restrain, thanks to the\npower of tradition, customs, and codes, certain natural instincts\nwhich man has inherited from his primitive animality.  It is\npossible to dominate them--and the more a people does overcome\nthem the more civilised it is--but they cannot be destroyed.  The\ninfluence of various exciting causes will readily result in their\nreappearance.\n\nThis is why the liberation of popular passions is so dangerous.\nThe torrent, once escaped from its bed, does not return until it\nhas spread devastation far and wide.  ``Woe to him who stirs up\nthe dregs of a nation,'' said Rivarol at the beginning of the\nRevolution.  ``There is no age of enlightenment for the\npopulace.''\n\n\n3. The supposed Part of the People during Revolution.\n\n\nThe laws of the psychology of crowds show us that the people\nnever acts without leaders, and that although it plays a\nconsiderable part in revolutions by following and exaggerating\nthe impulses received, it never directs its own movements.\n\nIn all political revolutions we discover the action of leaders.\nThey do not create the ideas which serve as the basis of\nrevolutions, but they utilise them as a means of action.  Ideas,\nleaders, armies, and crowds constitute four elements which all\nhave their part to play in revolutions.\n\nThe crowd, roused by the leaders, acts especially by means of its\nmass.  Its action is comparable to that of the shell which\nperforates an armour-plate by the momentum of a force it did not\ncreate.  Rarely does the crowd understand anything of the\nrevolutions accomplished with its assistance.  It obediently\nfollows its leaders without even trying to find out what they\nwant.  It overthrew Charles X. because of his Ordinances without\nhaving any idea of the contents of the latter, and would have\nbeen greatly embarrassed had it been asked at a later date why it\noverthrew Louis-Philippe.\n\nDeceived by appearances, many authors, from Michelet to Aulard,\nhave supposed that the people effected our great Revolution.\n\n``The principal actor,'' said Michelet, ``is the people.''\n\n``It is an error to say,'' writes M. Aulard, ``that the French\nRevolution was effected by a few distinguished people or a few\nheroes. . . .  I believe that in the whole history of the period\nincluded between 1789 and 1799 not a single person stands out who\nled or shaped events: neither Louis XVI. nor Mirabeau nor Danton\nnor Robespierre.  Must we say that it was the French people that\nwas the real hero of the French Revolution?  Yes--provided we see\nthe French people not as a multitude but as a number of organised\ngroups.''\n\nAnd in a recent work M. A. Cochin insists on this conception of\npopular action.\n\n``And here is the wonder:  Michelet is right.  In proportion as\nwe know them better the facts seem to consecrate the fiction:\nthis crowd, without chiefs and without laws, the very image of\nchaos, did for five years govern and command, speak and act, with\na precision, a consistency, and an entirety that were\nmarvellous.  Anarchy gave lessons in order and discipline to the\ndefeated party of order . . . twenty-five millions of men, spread\nover an area of 30,000 square leagues, acted as one.''\n\nCertainly if this simultaneous conduct of the people had been\nspontaneous, as the author supposes, it would have been\nmarvellous.  M. Aulard himself understands very well the\nimpossibilities of such a phenomenon, for he is careful, in\nspeaking of the people, to say that he is speaking of groups, and\nthat these groups may have been guided by leaders:--\n\n``And what, then, cemented the national unity?  Who saved this\nnation, attacked by the king and rent by civil war?  Was it\nDanton?  Was it Robespierre?  Was it Carnot?  Certainly these\nindividual men were of service: but unity was in fact maintained\nand independence assured by the grouping of the French into\ncommunes and popular societies--people's clubs.  It was the\nmunicipal and Jacobin organisation of France that forced the\ncoalition of Europe to retreat.  But in each group, if we look\nmore closely, there were two or three individuals more capable\nthan the rest, who, whether leaders or led, executed decisions\nand had the appearance of leaders, but who (if, for instance, we\nread the proceedings of the people's clubs) seem to us to have\ndrawn their strength far more from their group than from\nthemselves.\n\nM. Aulard's mistake consists in supposing that all these groups\nwere derived ``from a spontaneous movement of fraternity and\nreason.''  France at that time was covered with thousands of\nlittle clubs, receiving a single impulsion from the great\nJacobin Club of Paris, and obeying it with perfect docility.\nThis is what reality teaches us, though the illusions of the\nJacobins do not permit them to accept the fact.[3]\n\n\n\n[3] In the historical manuals which M. Aulard has prepared for\nthe use of classes in collaboration with M. Debidour the\nrole attributed to the people as an entity is even more\nmarked.  We see it intervening continually and spontaneously;\nhere are a few examples:--\n\nThe ``Day'' of June the 20th:  ``The king dismissed the\nGirondist members.  The people of Paris, indignant, rose\nspontaneously and invaded the Tuileries.''\n\nThe ``Day'' of August 10th:  ``The Legislative Assembly dared\nnot overthrow it; it was the people of Paris, aided by the\nFederals of the Departments, who effected this revolution at the\nprice of its blood.''\n\nThe conflict of the Girondists and the Mountain:  ``This\ndiscord in the face of the enemy was dangerous.  The people put\nan end to it on the days of the 31st of May and the 2nd of June,\n1793, when it forced the Convention to expel the leaders of the\nGironde from its midst and to decree their arrest.''\n\n\n\n4.  The Popular Entity and its Constituent Elements.\n\n\nIn order to answer to certain theoretical conceptions the people\nwas erected into a mystic entity, endowed with all the powers and\nall the virtues, incessantly praised by the politicians, and\noverwhelmed with flattery.  We shall see what we are to make of\nthis conception of the part played by the people in the French\nRevolution.\n\nTo the Jacobins of this epoch, as to those of our own days, this\npopular entity constitutes a superior personality possessing the\nattributes, peculiar to divinities, of never having to answer for\nits actions and never making a mistake.  Its wishes must be\nhumbly acceded.  The people may kill, burn, ravage, commit the\nmost frightful cruelties, glorify its hero to-day and throw him\ninto the gutter to-morrow; it is all one; the politicians will\nnot cease to vaunt its virtues, its high wisdom, and to bow to\nits every decision.[4]\n\n\n\n[4] These pretensions do at least seem to be growing untenable to\nthe more advanced republicans.\n\n``The rage with the socialists'' writes M. Clemenceau, ``is to\nendow with all the virtues, as though by a superhuman reason, the\ncrowd whose reason cannot be much to boast of.''  The famous\nstatesman might say more correctly that reason not only cannot be\nprominent in the crowd but is practically nonexistent.\n\n\n\n\nNow in what does this entity really consist, this mysterious\nfetich which revolutionists have revered for more than a century?\n\nIt may be decomposed into two distinct categories.  The first\nincludes the peasants, traders, and workers of all sorts who need\ntranquillity and order that they may exercise their calling.\nThis people forms the majority, but a majority which never caused\na revolution.  Living in laborious silence, it is ignored by the\nhistorians.\n\nThe second category, which plays a capital part in all national\ndisturbances, consists of a subversive social residue dominated\nby a criminal mentality.  Degenerates of alcoholism and poverty,\nthieves, beggars, destitute ``casuals,'' indifferent workers\nwithout employment--these constitute the dangerous bulk of the\narmies of insurrection.\n\nThe fear of punishment prevents many of them from becoming\ncriminals at ordinary times, but they do become criminals as soon\nas they can exercise their evil instincts without danger.\n\nTo this sinister substratum are due the massacres which stain all\nrevolutions.\n\nIt was this class which, guided by its leaders, continually\ninvaded the great revolutionary Assemblies.  These regiments of\ndisorder had no other ideal than that of massacre, pillage, and\nincendiarism.  Their indifference to theories and principles was\ncomplete.\n\nTo the elements recruited from the lowest dregs of the populace\nare added, by way of contagion, a host of idle and indifferent\npersons who are simply drawn into the movement.  They shout\nbecause there are men shouting, and revolt because there is a\nrevolt, without having the vaguest idea of the cause of shouting\nor revolution.  The suggestive power of their environment\nabsolutely hypnotises them, and impels them to action.\n\nThese noisy and maleficent crowds, the kernel of all\ninsurrections, from antiquity to our own times, are the only\ncrowds known to the orator.  To the orator they are the sovereign\npeople.  As a matter of fact this sovereign people is principally\ncomposed of the lower populace of whom Thiers said:--\n\n``Since the time when Tacitus saw it applaud the crimes of the\nemperors the vile populace has not changed.  These barbarians who\nswarm at the bottom of societies are always ready to stain the\npeople with every crime, at the beck of every power, and to the\ndishonour of every cause.''\n\nAt no period of history was the role of the lowest elements\nof the population exercised in such a lasting fashion as in the\nFrench Revolution.\n\nThe massacres began as soon as the beast was unchained--that is,\nfrom 1789, long before the Convention.  They were carried\nout with all possible refinements of cruelty.  During the killing\nof September the prisoners were slowly chopped to bits by sabre-\ncuts in order to prolong their agonies and amuse the spectators,\nwho experienced the greatest delight before the spectacle of the\nconvulsions of the victims and their shrieks of agony.\n\nSimilar scenes were observed all over France, even in the early\ndays of the Revolution, although the foreign war did not excuse\nthem then, nor any other pretext.\n\nFrom March to September a whole series of burnings, killings, and\npillagings drenched all France in blood.  Taine cites one hundred\nand twenty such cases.  Rouen, Lyons, Strasbourg, &c., fell into\nthe power of the populace.\n\nThe Mayor of Troyes, his eyes destroyed by blows of scissors, was\nmurdered after hours of suffering.  The Colonel of Dragoons\nBelzuce was cut to pieces while living.  In many places the\nhearts of the victims were torn out and carried about the cities\non the point of a pike.\n\nSuch is the behaviour of the base populace so soon as imprudent\nhands have broken the network of constraints which binds its\nancestral savagery.  It meets with every indulgence because it is\nin the interests of the politicians to flatter it.  But let us\nfor a moment suppose the thousands of beings who constitute it\ncondensed into one single being.  The personality thus formed\nwould appear as a cruel and narrow and abominable monster, more\nhorrible than the bloodiest tyrants of history.\n\nThis impulsive and ferocious people has always been easily\ndominated so soon as a strong power has opposed it.  If its\nviolence is unlimited, so is its servility.  All the despotisms\nhave had it for their servant.  The Caesars are certain of\nbeing acclaimed by it, whether they are named Caligula, Nero,\nMarat, Robespierre, or Boulanger.\n\nBeside these destructive hordes whose action during revolution is\ncapital, there exists, as we have already remarked, the mass of\nthe true people, which asks only the right to labour.  It\nsometimes benefits by revolutions, but never causes them.  The\nrevolutionary theorists know little of it and distrust it, aware\nof its traditional and conservative basis.  The resistant nucleus\nof a country, it makes the strength and continuity of the latter.\n\nExtremely docile through fear, easily influenced by its leaders,\nit will momentarily commit every excess while under their\ninfluence, but the ancestral inertia of the race will soon take\ncharge again, which is the reason why it so quickly tires of\nrevolution.  Its traditional soul quickly incites it to oppose\nitself to anarchy when the latter goes too far.  At such times it\nseeks the leader who will restore order.\n\nThis people, resigned and peaceable, has evidently no very lofty\nnor complicated political conceptions.  Its governmental ideal is\nalways very simple, is something very like dictatorship.  This is\nwhy, from the times of the Greeks to our own, dictatorship has\nalways followed anarchy.  It followed it after the first\nRevolution, when Bonaparte was acclaimed, and again when, despite\nopposition, four successive plebiscites raised Louis Napoleon to\nthe head of the republic, ratified his coup d'etat,\nre-established the Empire, and in 1870, before the war, approved\nof his rule.\n\nDoubtless in these last instances the people was deceived.  But\nwithout the revolutionary conspiracies which led to disorder, it\nwould not have been impelled to seek the means of escape\ntherefrom.\n\nThe facts recalled in this chapter must not be forgotten if we\nwish fully to comprehend the various roles of the people\nduring revolution.  Its action is considerable, but very unlike\nthat imagined by the legends whose repetition alone constitutes\ntheir vitality.\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\nTHE FORMS OF MENTALITY PREVALENT DURING REVOLUTION\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nINDIVIDUAL VARIATIONS OF CHARACTER IN TIME OF REVOLUTION\n\n1.  Transformations of Personality.\n\nI have dwelt at length elsewhere upon a certain theory of\ncharacter, without which it is absolutely impossible to\nunderstand divers transformations or inconsistencies of conduct\nwhich occur at certain moments, notably in time of revolution.\nHere are the principal points of this theory:\n\nEvery individual possesses, besides his habitual mentality,\nwhich, when the environment does not alter, is almost constant,\nvarious possibilities of character which may be evoked by passing\nevents.\n\nThe people who surround us are the creatures of certain\ncircumstances, but not of all circumstances.  Our ego consists of\nthe association of innumerable cellular egos, the residues of\nancestral personalities.  By their combination they form an\nequilibrium which is fairly permanent when the social environment\ndoes not vary.  As soon as this environment is considerably\nmodified, as in time of insurrection, this equilibrium is broken,\nand the dissociated elements constitute, by a fresh aggregation,\na new personality, which is manifested by ideas, feelings, and\nactions very different from those formerly observed in the same\nindividual.  Thus it is that during the Terror we see honest\nbourgeois and peaceful magistrates who were noted for their\nkindness turned into bloodthirsty fanatics.\n\nUnder the influence of environment the old personality may\ntherefore give place to one entirely new.  For this reason the\nactors in great religious and political crises often seem of a\ndifferent essence to ourselves; yet they do not differ from us;\nthe repetition of the same events would bring back the same men.\n\nNapoleon perfectly understood these possibilities of character\nwhen he said, in Saint Helena:--\n\n``It is because I know just how great a part chance plays in our\npolitical decisions, that I have always been without prejudices,\nand very indulgent as to the part men have taken during our\ndisturbances. . . .  In time of revolution one can only say what\none has done; it would not be wise to say that one could not have\ndone otherwise. . . .  Men are difficult to understand if we want\nto be just. . . .  Do they know themselves?  Do they account for\nthemselves very clearly?  There are virtues and vices of\ncircumstance.''\n\nWhen the normal personality has been disaggregated under the\ninfluence of certain events, how does the new personality form\nitself?  By several means, the most active of which is the\nacquisition of a strong belief.  This orientates all the elements\nof the understanding, as the magnet collects into regular\ncurves the filings of a magnetic metal.\n\nThus were formed the personalities observed in times of great\ncrises: the Crusades, the Reformation, the Revolution notably.\n\nAt normal times the environment varies little, so that as a rule\nwe see only a single personality in the individuals that surround\nus.  Sometimes, however, it happens that we observe several,\nwhich in certain circumstances may replace one another.\n\nThese personalities may be contradictory and even inimical.  This\nphenomenon, exceptional under normal conditions, is considerably\naccentuated in certain pathological conditions.  Morbid\npsychology has recorded several examples of multiple personality\nin a single subject, such as the cases cited by Morton Prince and\nPierre Janet.\n\nIn all these variations of personality it is not the intelligence\nwhich is modified, but the feelings, whose association forms the\ncharacter.\n\n\n2.  Elements of Character Predominant in Time of Revolution.\n\n\nDuring revolution we see several sentiments developed which are\ncommonly repressed, but to which the destruction of social\nconstraints gives a free vent.\n\nThese constraints, consisting of the law, morality, and\ntradition, are not always completely broken.  Some survive the\nupheaval and serve to some extent to damp the explosion of\ndangerous sentiments.\n\nThe most powerful of these restraints is the soul of the race.\nThis determines a manner of seeing, feeling, and willing\ncommon to the majority of the individuals of the same people; it\nconstitutes a hereditary custom, and nothing is more powerful\nthan the ties of custom.\n\nThis racial influence limits the variations of a people and\ndetermines its destiny within certain limits in spite of all\nsuperficial changes.\n\nFor example, to take only the instances of history, it would seem\nthat the mentality of France must have varied enormously during a\nsingle century.  In a few years it passed from the Revolution to\nCaesarism, returned to the monarchy, effected another\nRevolution, and then summoned a new Caesar.  In reality only\nthe outsides of things had changed.\n\nWe cannot insist further here on the limits of national\nvariability, but must now consider the influence of certain\naffective elements, whose development during revolution\ncontributes to modify individual or collective personalities.  In\nparticular I will mention hatred, fear, ambition, jealousy or\nenvy, vanity, and enthusiasm.  We observe their influence during\nseveral of the upheavals of history, notably during the course of\nthe French Revolution, which will furnish us with most of our\nexamples.\n\nHatred.--The hatred of persons, institutions, and things which\nanimated the men of the Revolution is one of these affective\nphenomena which are the more striking the more one studies their\npsychology.  They detested, not only their enemies, but the\nmembers of their own party.  ``If one were to accept\nunreservedly,'' said a recent writer, ``the judgments which they\nexpressed of one another, we should have to conclude that they\nwere all traitors and boasters, all incapable and corrupt,\nall assassins or tyrants.''  We know with what hatred, scarcely\nappeased by the death of their enemies, men persecuted the\nGirondists, Dantonists, Hebertists, Robespierrists, &c.\n\nOne of the chief causes of this feeling resided in the fact that\nthese furious sectaries, being apostles in possession of the\nabsolute verity, were unable, like all believers, to tolerate the\nsight of infidels.  A mystic or sentimental certitude is always\naccompanied by the need of forcing itself on others, is never\nconvinced, and does not shrink from wholesale slaughter when it\nhas the power to commit it.\n\nIf the hatreds that divided the men of the Revolution had been of\nrational origin they would not have lasted long, but, arising\nfrom affective and mystic factors, men could neither forget nor\nforgive.  Their sources being identical in the different parties,\nthey manifested themselves on every hand with identical violence.\n\nIt has been proved, by means of documents, that the Girondists\nwere no less sanguinary than the Montagnards.  They were the\nfirst to declare, with Petion, that the vanquished parties\nshould perish.  They also, according to M. Aulard, attempted to\njustify the massacres of September.  The Terror must not be\nconsidered simply as a means of defence, but as the general\nprocess of destruction to which triumphant believers have always\ntreated their detested enemies.  Men who can put up with the\ngreatest divergence of ideas cannot tolerate differences of\nbelief.\n\nIn religious or political warfare the vanquished can hope for no\nquarter.  From Sulla, who cut the throats of two hundred senators\nand five or six thousand Romans, to the men who suppressed the\nCommune, and shot down more than twenty thousand after\ntheir victory, this bloody law has never failed.  Proved over and\nover again in the past, it will doubtless be so in the future.\n\nThe hatreds of the Revolution did not arise entirely from\ndivergence of belief.  Other sentiments--envy, ambition, and\nself-love--also engendered them.  The rivalry of individuals\naspiring to power led the chiefs of the various groups in\nsuccession to the scaffold.\n\nWe must remember, moreover, that the need of division and the\nhatred resulting therefrom seem to be constituent elements of the\nLatin mind.  They cost our Gaulish ancestors their independence,\nand had already struck Caesar.\n\n``No city,'' he said, ``but was divided into two factions; no\ncanton, no village, no house in which the spirit of party did not\nbreathe.  It was very rarely that a year went by without a city\ntaking up arms to attack or repulse its neighbours.''\n\nAs man has only recently entered upon the age of knowledge, and\nhas always hitherto been guided by sentiments and beliefs, we may\nconceive the vast importance of hatred as a factor of his\nhistory.\n\nCommandant Colin, professor at the College of War, remarks in the\nfollowing terms on the importance of this feeling during certain\nwars:--\n\n``In war more than at any other time there is no better inspiring\nforce than hatred; it was hatred that made Blucher victorious\nover Napoleon.  Analyse the most wonderful manoeuvres, the most\ndecisive operations, and if they are not the work of an\nexceptional man, a Frederick or a Napoleon, you will find they\nare inspired by passion more than by calculation.  What\nwould the war of 1870 have been without the hatred which we bore\nthe Germans?''\n\nThe writer might have added that the intense hatred of the\nJapanese for the Russians, who had so humiliated them, might be\nclassed among the causes of their success.  The Russian soldiers,\nignorant of the very existence of the Japanese, had no animosity\nagainst them, which was one of the reasons of their failure.\n\nThere was assuredly a good deal of talk of fraternity at the time\nof the Revolution, and there is even more to-day.  Pacificism,\nhumanitarianism, and solidarity have become catchwords of the\nadvanced parties, but we know how profound are the hatreds\nconcealed beneath these terms, and what dangers overhang our\nmodern society.\n\nFear.--Fear plays almost as large a part in revolutions as\nhatred.  During the French Revolution there were many examples of\ngreat individual courage and many exhibitions of collective\ncowardice.\n\nFacing the scaffold, the men of the Convention were always brave\nin the extreme; but before the threats of the rioters who invaded\nthe Assembly they constantly exhibited an excessive\npusillanimity, obeying the most absurd injunctions, as we shall\nsee if we re-read the history of the revolutionary Assemblies.\n\nAll the forms of fear were observed at this period.  One of the\nmost widespread was the fear of appearing moderate.  Members of\nthe Assemblies, public prosecutors, representatives ``on\nmission,'' judges of the revolutionary tribunals, &c., all sought\nto appear more advanced than their rivals.  Fear was one of the\nprincipal elements of the crimes committed at this period.\nIf by some miracle it could have been eliminated from the\nrevolutionary Assemblies, their conduct would have been quite\nother than it was, and the Revolution itself would have taken a\nvery different direction.\n\nAmbition, Envy, Vanity, &c.--In normal times the influence of\nthese various affective elements is forcibly contained by social\nnecessities.  Ambition, for instance, is necessarily limited in a\nhierarchical form of society.  Although the soldier does\nsometimes become a general, it is only after a long term of\nservice.  In time of revolution, on the other hand, there is no\nneed to wait.  Every one may reach the upper ranks almost\nimmediately, so that all ambitions are violently aroused.  The\nhumblest man believes himself fitted for the highest employments,\nand by this very fact his vanity grows out of all measure.\n\nAll the passions being more or less aroused, including ambition\nand vanity, we see the development of jealousy and envy of those\nwho have succeeded more quickly than others.\n\nThe effect of jealousy, always important in times of revolution,\nwas especially so during the great French Revolution.  Jealousy\nof the nobility constituted one of its most important factors.\nThe middle classes had increased in capacity and wealth, to the\npoint of surpassing the nobility.  Although they mingled with the\nnobles more and more, they felt, none the less, that they were\nheld at a distance, and this they keenly resented.  This frame of\nmind had unconsciously made the bourgeoisie keen supporters of\nthe philosophic doctrine of equality.\n\nWounded self-love and jealousy were thus the causes of\nhatreds that we can scarcely conceive today, when the social\ninfluence of the nobility is so small.  Many members of the\nConvention--Carrier, Marat, and others--remembered with anger\nthat they had once occupied subordinate positions in the\nestablishments of great nobles.  Mme. Roland was never able to\nforget that, when she and her mother were invited to the house of\na great lady under the ancien regime, they had been sent to\ndine in the servants' quarters.\n\nThe philosopher Rivarol has very well described in the following\npassage, already cited by Taine, the influence of wounded self-\nlove and jealousy upon the revolutionary hatreds:--\n\n``It is not,'' he writes, ``the taxes, nor the lettres de\ncachet, nor any of the other abuses of authority; it is not the\nsins of the intendants, nor the long and ruinous delays of\njustice, that has most angered the nation; it is the prejudices\nof the nobility for which it has exhibited the greatest hatred.\nWhat proves this clearly is the fact that it is the bourgeois,\nthe men of letters, the men of money, in fact all those who are\njealous of the nobility, who have raised the poorer inhabitants\nof the cities against them, and the peasants in the country\ndistricts.''\n\nThis very true statement partly justifies the saying of Napoleon:\n\n``Vanity made the Revolution; liberty was only the pretext.''\n\nEnthusiasm.--The enthusiasm of the founders of the Revolution\nequalled that of the apostles of the faith of Mohammed.  And it\nwas really a religion that the bourgeois of the first Assembly\nthought to found.  They thought to have destroyed an old\nworld, and to have built a new one upon its ruins.  Never\ndid illusion more seductive fire the hearts of men.  Equality and\nfraternity, proclaimed by the new dogmas, were to bring the reign\nof eternal happiness to all the peoples.  Man had broken for ever\nwith a past of barbarity and darkness.  The regenerated world\nwould in future be illuminated by the lucid radiance of pure\nreason.  On all hands the most brilliant oratorical formulae\nsaluted the expected dawn.\n\nThat this enthusiasm was so soon replaced by violence was due to\nthe fact that the awakening was speedy and terrible.  One can\nreadily conceive the indignant fury with which the apostles of\nthe Revolution attacked the daily obstacles opposed to the\nrealisation of their dreams.  They had sought to reject the past,\nto forget tradition, to make man over again.  But the past\nreappeared incessantly, and men refused to change.  The\nreformers, checked in their onward march, would not give in.\nThey sought to impose by force a dictatorship which speedily made\nmen regret the system abolished, and finally led to its return.\n\nIt is to be remarked that although the enthusiasm of the first\ndays did not last in the revolutionary Assemblies, it survived\nvery much longer in the armies, and constituted their chief\nstrength.  To tell the truth, the armies of the Revolution were\nrepublican long before France became so, and remained republican\nlong after France had ceased to be so.\n\nThe variations of character considered in this chapter, being\nconditioned by certain common aspirations and identical changes\nof environment, finally became concrete in a small number\nof fairly homogeneous mentalities.  Speaking only of the more\ncharacteristic, we may refer them to four types: the Jacobin,\nmystic, revolutionary, and criminal mentalities.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE MYSTIC MENTALITY AND THE JACOBIN MENTALITY\n\n1.  Classification of Mentalities predominant in Time of\nRevolution.\n\nThe classifications without which the study of the sciences is\nimpossible must necessarily establish the discontinuous in the\ncontinuous, and for that reason are to a certain extent\nartificial.  But they are necessary, since the continuous is only\naccessible in the form of the discontinuous.\n\nTo create broad distinctions between the various mentalities\nobservable in time of revolution, as we are about to do, is\nobviously to separate elements which encroach upon one another,\nwhich are fused or superimposed.  We must resign ourselves to\nlosing a little in exactitude in order to gain in lucidity.  The\nfundamental types enumerated at the end of the preceding chapter,\nand which we are about to describe, synthetise groups which would\nescape analysis were we to attempt to study them in all their\ncomplexity.\n\nWe have shown that man is influenced by different logics, which\nunder normal conditions exist in juxtaposition, without mutually\ninfluencing one another.  Under the action of various events they\nenter into mutual conflict, and the irreducible differences\nwhich divide them are visibly manifested, involving considerable\nindividual and social upheavals.\n\nMystic logic, which we shall presently consider as it appears in\nthe Jacobin mind, plays a very important part.  But it is not\nalone in its action.  The other forms of logic--affective logic,\ncollective logic, and rational logic--may predominate according\nto circumstances.\n\n\n2.  The Mystic Mentality.\n\n\nLeaving aside for the moment the influence of affective,\nrational, and collective logic, we will occupy ourselves solely\nwith the considerable part played by the mystic elements which\nhave prevailed in so many revolutions, and notably in the French\nRevolution.\n\nThe chief characteristic of the mystic temperament consists in\nthe attribution of a mysterious power to superior beings or\nforces, which are incarnated in the form of idols, fetiches,\nwords, or formulae.\n\nThe mystic spirit is at the bottom of all the religious and most\npolitical beliefs.  These latter would often vanish could we\ndeprive them of the mystic elements which are their chief\nsupport.\n\nGrafted on the sentiments and passionate impulses which it\ndirects, mystic logic constitutes the might of the great popular\nmovements.  Men who would be by no means ready to allow\nthemselves to be killed for the best of reasons will readily\nsacrifice their lives to a mystic ideal which has become an\nobject of adoration.\n\nThe principles of the Revolution speedily inspired a wave of\nmystic enthusiasm analogous to those provoked by the various\nreligious beliefs which had preceded it.  All they did was to\nchange the orientation of a mental ancestry which the\ncenturies had solidified.\n\nSo there is nothing astonishing in the savage zeal of the men of\nthe Convention.  Their mystic mentality was the same as that of\nthe Protestants at the time of the Reformation.  The principal\nheroes of the Terror--Couthon, Saint-Just, Robespierre, &c.--were\nApostles.  Like Polyeuctes, destroying the altars of the false\ngods to propagate his faith, they dreamed of converting the\nglobe.  Their enthusiasm spilled itself over the earth.\nPersuaded that their magnificent formulae were sufficient to\noverturn thrones, they did not hesitate to declare war upon\nkings.  And as a strong faith is always superior to a doubtful\nfaith, they victoriously faced all Europe.\n\nThe mystic spirit of the leaders of the Revolution was betrayed\nin the least details of their public life.  Robespierre,\nconvinced that he was supported by the Almighty, assured his\nhearers in a speech that the Supreme Being had ``decreed the\nRepublic since the beginning of time.''  In his quality of High\nPontiff of a State religion he made the Convention vote a decree\ndeclaring that ``the French People recognises the existence of\nthe Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul.''  At the\nfestival of this Supreme Being, seated on a kind of throne, he\npreached a lengthy sermon.\n\nThe Jacobin Club, directed by Robespierre, finally assumed all\nthe functions of a council.  There Maximilien proclaimed ``the\nidea of a Great Being who watches over oppressed innocence and\nwho punishes triumphant crime.''\n\nAll the heretics who criticised the Jacobin orthodoxy were\nexcommunicated--that is, were sent to the Revolutionary Tribunal,\nwhich they left only for the scaffold.\n\nThe mystic mentality of which Robespierre was the most celebrated\nrepresentative did not die with him.  Men of identical mentality\nare to be found among the French politicians of to-day.  The old\nreligious beliefs no longer rule their minds, but they are the\ncreatures of political creeds which they would very soon force on\nothers, as did Robespierre, if they had the chance of so doing.\nAlways ready to kill if killing would spread their faith, the\nmystics of all ages have employed the same means of persuasion as\nsoon as they have become the masters.\n\nIt is therefore quite natural that Robespierre should still have\nmany admirers.  Minds moulded like his are to be met with in\ntheir thousands.  His conceptions were not guillotined with him.\nOld as humanity, they will only disappear with the last believer.\n\nThis mystic aspect of all revolutions has escaped the majority of\nthe historians.  They will persist for a long time yet in trying\nto explain by means of rational logic a host of phenomena which\nhave nothing to do with reason.  I have already cited a passage\nfrom the history of MM. Lavisse and Rambaud, in which the\nReformation is explained as ``the result of the free individual\nreflections suggested to simple folk by an extremely pious\nconscience, and a bold and courageous reason.''\n\nSuch movements are never comprehended by those who imagine that\ntheir origin is rational.  Political or religious, the beliefs\nwhich have moved the world possess a common origin and\nfollow the same laws.  They are formed, not by the reason, but\nmore often contrary to reason.  Buddhism, Christianity, Islamism,\nthe Reformation, sorcery, Jacobinism, socialism, spiritualism,\n&c., seem very different forms of belief, but they have, I\nrepeat, identical mystic and affective bases, and obey forms of\nlogic which have no affinity with rational logic.  Their might\nresides precisely in the fact that reason has as little power to\ncreate them as to transform them.\n\nThe mystic mentality of our modern political apostles is strongly\nmarked in an article dealing with one of our recent ministers,\nwhich I cite from a leading journal:\n\n``One may ask into what category does M. A----fall?  Could we\nsay, for instance, that he belongs to the group of unbelievers?\nFar from it!  Certainly M. A---- has not adopted any positive\nfaith; certainly he curses Rome and Geneva, rejecting all the\ntraditional dogmas and all the known Churches.  But if he makes a\nclean sweep it is in order to found his own Church on the ground\nso cleared, a Church more dogmatic than all the rest; and his own\ninquisition, whose brutal intolerance would have no reason to\nenvy the most notorious of Torquemadas.\n\n`` `We cannot,' he says, `allow such a thing as scholastic\nneutrality.  We demand lay instruction in all its plenitude, and\nare consequently the enemies of educational liberty.'  If he does\nnot suggest erecting the stake and the pyre, it is only on\naccount of the evolution of manners, which he is forced to take\ninto account to a certain extent, whether he will or no.  But,\nnot being able to commit men to the torture, he invokes the\nsecular arm to condemn their doctrines to death.  This is exactly\nthe point of view of the great inquisitors.  It is the same\nattack upon thought.  This freethinker has so free a spirit that\nevery philosophy he does not accept appears to him, not only\nridiculous and grotesque, but criminal.  He flatters himself that\nhe alone is in possession of the absolute truth.  Of this he is\nso entirely sure that everyone who contradicts him seems to him\nan execrable monster and a public enemy.  He does not suspect for\na moment that after all his personal views are only hypotheses,\nand that he is all the more laughable for claiming a Divine right\nfor them precisely because they deny divinity.  Or, at least,\nthey profess to do so; but they re-establish it in another shape,\nwhich immediately makes one regret the old.  M. A---- is a\nsectary of the goddess Reason, of whom he has made a Moloch, an\noppressive deity hungry for sacrifice.  No more liberty of\nthought for any one except for himself and his friends; such is\nthe free thought of M. A----.  The outlook is truly attractive.\nBut perhaps too many idols have been cast down during the last\nfew centuries for men to bow before this one.''\n\nWe must hope for the sake of liberty that these gloomy fanatics\nwill never finally become our masters.\n\nGiven the silent power of reason over mystic beliefs, it is quite\nuseless to seek to discuss, as is so often done, the rational\nvalue of revolutionary or political ideas.  Only their influence\ncan interest us.  It matters little that the theories of the\nsupposed equality of men, the original goodness of mankind, the\npossibility of re-making society by means of laws, have\nbeen given the lie by observation and experience.  These empty\nillusions must be counted among the most potent motives of action\nthat humanity has known.\n\n\n3.  The Jacobin Mentality.\n\n\nAlthough the term ``Jacobin mentality'' does not really belong to\nany true classification, I employ it here because it sums up a\nclearly defined combination which constitutes a veritable\npsychological species.\n\nThis mentality dominates the men of the French Revolution, but is\nnot peculiar to them, as it still represents one of the most\nactive elements in our politics.\n\nThe mystic mentality which we have already considered is an\nessential factor of the Jacobin mind, but it is not in itself\nenough to constitute that mind.  Other elements, which we shall\nnow examine, must be added.\n\nThe Jacobins do not in the least suspect their mysticism.  On the\ncontrary, they profess to be guided solely by pure reason.\nDuring the Revolution they invoked reason incessantly, and\nconsidered it as their only guide to conduct.\n\nThe majority of historians have adopted this rationalist\nconception of the Jacobin mind, and Taine fell into the same\nerror.  It is in the abuse of rationalism that he seeks the\norigin of a great proportion of the acts of the Jacobins.  The\npages in which he has dealt with the subject contain many truths,\nhowever, and as they are in other ways very remarkable, I\nreproduce the most important passages here:--\n\n``Neither exaggerated self-love nor dogmatic reasoning is\nrare in the human species.  In all countries these two roots of\nthe Jacobin spirit subsist, secret and indestructible. . . .  At\ntwenty years of age, when a young man is entering into the world,\nhis reason is stimulated simultaneously with his pride. In the\nfirst place, whatever society he may move in, it is contemptible\nto pure reason, for it has not been constructed by a philosophic\nlegislator according to a principle, but successive generations\nhave arranged it according to their multiple and ever-changing\nneeds.  It is not the work of logic, but of history, and the\nyoung reasoner shrugs his shoulders at the sight of this old\nbuilding, whose site is arbitrary, whose architecture is\nincoherent, and whose inconveniences are obvious. . . .  The\nmajority of young people, above all those who have their way to\nmake, are more or less Jacobin on leaving college. . . .\nJacobinism is born of social decomposition just as mushrooms are\nborn of a fermenting soil.  Consider the authentic monuments of\nits thought--the speeches of Robespierre and Saint-Just, the\ndebates of the Legislative Assembly and the Convention, the\nharangues, addresses, and reports of Girondists and Montagnards.\nNever did men speak so much to say so little; the empty verbiage\nand swollen emphasis swamp any truth there may be beneath their\nmonotony and their turgidity.  The Jacobin is full of respect for\nthe phantoms of his reasoning brain; in his eyes they are more\nreal than living men, and their suffrage is the only suffrage he\nrecognises--he will march onward in all sincerity at the head of\na procession of imaginary followers.  The millions of\nmetaphysical wills which he has created in the image of his own\nwill sustain him by their unanimous assent, and he will\nproject outwards, like a chorus of triumph and acclamation, the\ninward echo of his own voice.''\n\nWhile admiring Taine's description, I think he has not exactly\ngrasped the psychology of the Jacobin.\n\nThe mind of the true Jacobin, at the time of the Revolution as\nnow, was composed of elements which we must analyse if we are to\nunderstand its function.\n\nThis analysis will show in the first place that the Jacobin is\nnot a rationalist, but a believer.  Far from building his belief\non reason, he moulds reason to his belief, and although his\nspeeches are steeped in rationalism he employs it very little in\nhis thoughts and his conduct.\n\nA Jacobin who reasoned as much as he is accused of reasoning\nwould be sometimes accessible to the voice of reason.  Now,\nobservation proves, from the time of the Revolution to our own\ndays, that the Jacobin is never influenced by reasoning, however\njust, and it is precisely here that his strength resides.\n\nAnd why is he not accessible to reason?  Simply because his\nvision of things, always extremely limited, does not permit of\nhis resisting the powerful and passionate impulses which guide\nhim.\n\nThese two elements, feeble reason and strong passions, would not\nof themselves constitute the Jacobin mind.  There is another.\n\nPassion supports convictions, but hardly ever creates them.  Now,\nthe true Jacobin has forcible convictions.  What is to sustain\nthem?  Here the mystic elements whose action we have already\nstudied come into play.  The Jacobin is a mystic who has\nreplaced the old divinities by new gods.  Imbued with the power\nof words and formulae, he attributes to these a mysterious\npower.  To serve these exigent divinities he does not shrink from\nthe most violent measures.  The laws voted by our modern Jacobins\nfurnish a proof of this fact.\n\nThe Jacobin mentality is found especially in narrow and\npassionate characters.  It implies, in fact, a narrow and rigid\nmind, inaccessible to all criticism and to all considerations but\nthose of faith.\n\nThe mystic and affective elements which dominate the mind of the\nJacobin condemn him to an extreme simplicity.  Grasping only the\nsuperficial relations of things, nothing prevents him from taking\nfor realities the chimerical images which are born of his\nimagination.  The sequence of phenomena and their results escape\nhim.  He never raises his eyes from his dream.\n\nAs we may see, it is not by the development of his logical reason\nthat the Jacobin exceeds.  He possesses very little logic of this\nkind, and therefore he often becomes dangerous.  Where a superior\nman would hesitate or halt the Jacobin, who has placed his feeble\nreason at the service of his impulses, goes forward with\ncertainty.\n\nSo that although the Jacobin is a great reasoner, this does not\nmean that he is in the least guided by reason.  When he imagines\nhe is being led by reason it is really his passions and his\nmysticism that lead him.  Like all those who are convinced and\nhemmed in by the walls of faith, he can never escape therefrom.\n\nA true aggressive theologian, he is astonishingly like the\ndisciples of Calvin described in a previous chapter.  Hypnotised\nby their faith, nothing could deter them from their object.  All\nthose who contradicted their articles of faith were considered\nworthy of death.  They too seemed to be powerful reasoners.\nIgnorant, like the Jacobins, of the secret forces that led them,\nthey believed that reason was their sole guide, while in reality\nthey were the slaves of mysticism and passion.\n\nThe truly rationalistic Jacobin would be incomprehensible, and\nwould merely make reason despair.  The passionate and mystical\nJacobin is, on the contrary, easily intelligible.\n\nWith these three elements--a very weak reasoning power, very\nstrong passions, and an intense mysticism--we have the true\npsychological components of the mind of the Jacobin.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY AND CRIMINAL MENTALITIES\n\n1.  The Revolutionary Mentality.\n\nWe have just seen that the mystic elements are one of the\ncomponents of the Jacobin mentality.  We shall now see that they\nenter into another form of mentality which is also clearly\ndefined, the revolutionary mentality.\n\nIn all ages societies have contained a certain number of restless\nspirits, unstable and discontented, ready to rebel against any\nestablished order of affairs.  They are actuated by the mere love\nof revolt, and if some magic power could realise all their\ndesires they would simply revolt again.\n\nThis special mentality often results from a faulty adaptation of\nthe individual to his surroundings, or from an excess of\nmysticism, but it may also be merely a question of temperament or\narise from pathological disturbances.\n\nThe need of revolt presents very different degrees of intensity,\nfrom simple discontent expressed in words directed against men\nand things to the need of destroying them.  Sometimes the\nindividual turns upon himself the revolutionary frenzy that he\ncannot otherwise exercise.  Russia is full of these madmen,\nwho, not content with committing arson or throwing bombs at\nhazard into the crowd, finally mutilate themselves, like the\nSkopzis and other analogous sects.\n\nThese perpetual rebels are generally highly suggestible beings,\nwhose mystic mentality is obsessed by fixed ideas.  Despite the\napparent energy indicated by their actions they are really weak\ncharacters, and are incapable of mastering themselves\nsufficiently to resist the impulses that rule them.  The mystic\nspirit which animates them furnishes pretexts for their violence,\nand enables them to regard themselves as great reformers.\n\nIn normal times the rebels which every society contains are\nrestrained by the laws, by their environment--in short, by all\nthe usual social constraints, and therefore remain undetected.\nBut as soon as a time of disturbance begins these constraints\ngrow weaker, and the rebel can give a free reign to his\ninstincts.  He then becomes the accredited leader of a movement.\nThe motive of the revolution matters little to him; he will give\nhis life indifferently for the red flag or the white, or for the\nliberation of a country which he has heard vaguely mentioned.\n\nThe revolutionary spirit is not always pushed to the extremes\nwhich render it dangerous.  When, instead of deriving from\naffective or mystic impulses, it has an intellectual origin, it\nmay become a source of progress.  It is thanks to those spirits\nwho are sufficiently independent to be intellectually\nrevolutionary that a civilisation is able to escape from the yoke\nof tradition and habit when this becomes too heavy.  The\nsciences, arts, and industries especially have progressed by\nthe aid of such men.  Galileo, Lavoisier, Darwin, and Pasteur\nwere such revolutionaries.\n\nAlthough it is not necessary that a nation should possess any\nlarge number of such spirits, it is very necessary that it should\npossess some.  Without them men would still be living in caves.\n\nThe revolutionary audacity which results in discoveries implies\nvery rare faculties.  It necessitates notably an independence of\nmind sufficient to escape from the influence of current opinions,\nand a judgement that can grasp, under superficial analogies, the\nhidden realities.  This form of revolutionary spirit is creative,\nwhile that examined above is destructive.\n\nThe revolutionary mentality may, therefore, be compared to\ncertain physiological states in the life of the individual which\nare normally useful, but which, when exaggerated, take a\npathological form which is always hurtful.\n\n\n2.  The Criminal Mentality.\n\n\nAll the civilised societies inevitably drag behind them a residue\nof degenerates, of the unadapted, of persons affected by various\ntaints.  Vagabonds, beggars, fugitives from justice, thieves,\nassassins, and starving creatures that live from day to day, may\nconstitute the criminal population of the great cities.  In\nordinary times these waste products of civilisation are more or\nless restrained by the police.  During revolution nothing\nrestrains them, and they can easily gratify their instincts to\nmurder and plunder.  In the dregs of society the revolutionaries\nof all times are sure of finding recruits.  Eager only to kill\nand to plunder, little matters to them the cause they are\nsworn to defend.  If the chances of murder and pillage are better\nin the party attacked, they will promptly change their colours.\n\nTo these criminals, properly so called, the incurable plague of\nall societies, we must add the class of semi-criminals.\nWrongdoers on occasion, they never rebel so long as the fear of\nthe established order restrains them, but as soon as it weakens\nthey enrol themselves in the army of revolution.\n\nThese two categories--habitual and occasional criminals--form an\narmy of disorder which is fit for nothing but the creation of\ndisorder.  All the revolutionaries, all the founders of religious\nor political leagues, have constantly counted on their support.\n\nWe have already stated that this population, with its criminal\nmentality, exercised a considerable influence during the French\nRevolution.  It always figured in the front rank of the riots\nwhich occurred almost daily.  Certain historians have spoken with\nrespect and emotion of the way in which the sovereign people\nenforced its will upon the Convention, invading the hall armed\nwith pikes, the points of which were sometimes decorated with\nnewly severed heads.  If we analyse the elements composing the\npretended delegations of the sovereign people, we shall find\nthat, apart from a small number of simple souls who submitted to\nthe impulses of the leaders, the mass was almost entirely formed\nof the bandits of whom I have been speaking.  To them were due\nthe innumerable murders of which the massacres of September and\nthe killing of the Princesse de Lamballe were merely typical.\n\nThey terrorised all the great Assemblies, from the Constituent\nAssembly to the Convention, and for ten years they helped to\nravage France.  If by some miracle this army of criminals could\nhave been eliminated, the progress of the Revolution would have\nbeen very different.  They stained it with blood from its dawn to\nits decline.  Reason could do nothing with them but they could do\nmuch against reason.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF REVOLUTIONARY CROWDS\n\n1.  General Characteristics of the Crowd.\n\nWhatever their origin, revolutions do not produce their full\neffects until they have penetrated the soul of the multitude.\nThey therefore represent a consequence of the psychology of\ncrowds.\n\nAlthough I have studied collective psychology at length in\nanother volume, I must here recall its principal laws.\n\nMan, as part of a multitude, is a very different being from the\nsame man as an isolated individual.  His conscious individuality\nvanishes in the unconscious personality of the crowd.\n\nMaterial contact is not absolutely necessary to produce in the\nindividual the mentality of the crowd.  Common passions and\nsentiments, provoked by certain events, are often sufficient to\ncreate it.\n\nThe collective mind, momentarily formed, represents a very\nspecial kind of aggregate.  Its chief peculiarity is that it is\nentirely dominated by unconscious elements, and is subject to a\npeculiar collective logic.\n\nAmong the other characteristics of crowds, we must note their\ninfinite credulity and exaggerated sensibility, their short-\nsightedness, and their incapacity to respond to the influences of\nreason.  Affirmation, contagion, repetition, and prestige\nconstitute almost the only means of persuading them.  Reality and\nexperience have no effect upon them.  The multitude will admit\nanything; nothing is impossible in the eyes of the crowd.\n\nBy reason of the extreme sensibility of crowds, their sentiments,\ngood or bad, are always exaggerated.  This exaggeration increases\nstill further in times of revolution.  The least excitement will\nthen lead the multitude to act with the utmost fury.  Their\ncredulity, so great even in the normal state, is still further\nincreased; the most improbable statements are accepted.  Arthur\nYoung relates that when he visited the springs near Clermont, at\nthe time of the French Revolution, his guide was stopped by the\npeople, who were persuaded that he had come by order of the Queen\nto mine and blow up the town.  The most horrible tales concerning\nthe Royal Family were circulated, depicting it as a nest of\nghouls and vampires.\n\nThese various characteristics show that man in the crowd descends\nto a very low degree in the scale of civilisation.  He becomes a\nsavage, with all a savage's faults and qualities, with all his\nmomentary violence, enthusiasm, and heroism.  In the intellectual\ndomain a crowd is always inferior to the isolated unit.  In the\nmoral and sentimental domain it may be his superior.  A crowd\nwill commit a crime as readily as an act of abnegation.\n\nPersonal characteristics vanish in the crowd, which exerts an\nextraordinary influence upon the individuals which form it.  The\nmiser becomes generous, the sceptic a believer, the honest\nman a criminal, the coward a hero.  Examples of such\ntransformations abounded during the great Revolution.\n\nAs part of a jury or a parliament, the collective man renders\nverdicts or passes laws of which he would never have dreamed in\nhis isolated condition.\n\nOne of the most notable consequences of the influence of a\ncollectivity upon the individuals who compose it is the\nunification of their sentiments and wills.  This psychological\nunity confers a remarkable force upon crowds.\n\nThe formation of such a mental unity results chiefly from the\nfact that in a crowd gestures and actions are extremely\ncontagious.  Acclamations of hatred, fury, or love are\nimmediately approved and repeated.\n\nWhat is the origin of these common sentiments, this common will?\nThey are propagated by contagion, but a point of departure is\nnecessary before this contagion can take effect.  Without a\nleader the crowd is an amorphous entity incapable of action.\n\nA knowledge of the laws relating to the psychology of crowds is\nindispensable to the interpretation of the elements of our\nRevolution, and to a comprehension of the conduct of\nrevolutionary assemblies, and the singular transformations of the\nindividuals who form part of them.  Pushed by the unconscious\nforces of the collective soul, they more often than not say what\nthey did not intend, and vote what they would not have wished to\nvote.\n\nAlthough the laws of collective psychology have sometimes been\ndivined instinctively by superior statesmen, the majority of\nGovernments have not understood and do not understand\nthem.  It is because they do not understand them that so many of\nthem have fallen so easily.  When we see the facility with which\ncertain Governments were overthrown by an insignificant riot--as\nhappened in the case of the monarchy of Louis-Philippe--the\ndangers of an ignorance of collective psychology are evident.\nThe marshal in command of the troops in 1848, which were more\nthan sufficient to defend the king, certainly did not understand\nthat the moment he allowed the crowd to mingle with the troops\nthe latter, paralysed by suggestion and contagion, would cease to\ndo their duty.  Neither did he know that as the multitude is\nextremely sensible to prestige it needs a great display of force\nto impress it, and that such a display will at once suppress\nhostile demonstrations.  He was equally ignorant of the fact that\nall gatherings should be dispersed immediately.  All these things\nhave been taught by experience, but in 1848 these lessons had not\nbeen grasped.  At the time of the great Revolution the psychology\nof crowds was even less understood.\n\n\n2.  How the Stability of the Racial Mind limits the Oscillations\nof the Mind of the Crowd.\n\n\nA people can in a sense be likened to a crowd.  It possesses\ncertain characteristics, but the oscillations of these\ncharacteristics are limited by the soul or mind of the race.  The\nmind of the race has a fixity unknown to the transitory mind of\nthe crowd.\n\nWhen a people possesses an ancestral soul established by a long\npast the soul of the crowd is always dominated thereby.\n\nA people differs from a crowd also in that it is composed of a\ncollection of groups, each having different interests and\npassions.  In a crowd properly so-called--a popular assembly, for\nexample--there are unities which may belong to very different\nsocial categories.\n\nA people sometimes seems as mobile as a crowd, but we must not\nforget that behind its mobility, its enthusiasms, its violence\nand destructiveness, the extremely tenacious and conservative\ninstincts of the racial mind persist.  The history of the\nRevolution and the century which has followed shows how the\nconservative spirit finally overcomes the spirit of destruction.\nMore than one system of government which the people has shattered\nhas been restored by the people.\n\nIt is not as easy to work upon the mind of the people--that is,\nthe mind of the race--as on the mind of a crowd.  The means of\naction are indirect and slower (journals, conferences, speeches,\nbooks, &c.).  The elements of persuasion always come under the\nheadings already given: affirmation, repetition, prestige, and\ncontagion.\n\nMental contagion may affect a whole people instantaneously, but\nmore often it operates slowly, creeping from group to group.\nThus was the Reformation propagated in France.\n\nA people is far less excitable than a crowd; but certain events--\nnational insults, threats of invasion, &c.--may arouse it\ninstantly.  Such a phenomenon was observed on several occasions\nduring the Revolution, notably at the time of the insolent\nmanifesto issued by the Duke of Brunswick.  The Duke knew little\nindeed of the psychology of the French race when he\nproffered his threats.  Not only did he considerably prejudice\nthe cause of Louis XVI.; but he also damaged his own, since his\nintervention raised from the soil an army eager to fight him.\n\nThis sudden explosion of feeling throughout a whole race has been\nobserved in all nations.  Napoleon did not understand the power\nof such explosions when he invaded Spain and Russia.  One may\neasily disaggregate the facile mind of a crowd, but one can do\nnothing before the permanent soul of a race.  Certainly the\nRussian peasant is a very indifferent being, gross and narrow by\nnature, yet at the first news of invasion he was transformed.\nOne may judge of this fact on reading a letter written by\nElizabeth, wife of the Emperor Alexander I.\n\n``From the moment when Napoleon had crossed our frontiers it was\nas though an electric spark had spread through all Russia; and if\nthe immensity of its area had made it possible for the news to\npenetrate simultaneously to every corner of the Empire a cry of\nindignation would have arisen so terrible that I believe it would\nhave resounded to the ends of the earth.  As Napoleon advances\nthis feeling is growing yet stronger.  Old men who have lost all\nor nearly all their goods are saying:  `We shall find a way of\nliving.  Anything is preferable to a shameful peace.'  Women all\nof whose kin are in the army regard the dangers they are running\nas secondary, and fear nothing but peace.  Happily this peace,\nwhich would be the death-warrant of Russia, will not be\nnegotiated; the Emperor does not conceive of such an idea, and\neven if he would he could not.  This is the heroic side of our\nposition.''\n\nThe Empress describes to her mother the two following traits,\nwhich give some idea of the degree of resistance of which the\nsoul of the Russian is capable:--\n\n``The Frenchmen had caught some unhappy peasants in Moscow, whom\nthey thought to force to serve in their ranks, and in order that\nthey should not be able to escape they branded their hands as one\nbrands horses in the stud.  One of them asked what this mark\nmeant; he was told it signified that he was a French soldier.\n`What!  I am a soldier of the Emperor of the French!' he said.\nAnd immediately he took his hatchet, cut off his hand, and threw\nit at the feet of those present, saying, `Take it--there's your\nmark!'\n\n``At Moscow, too, the French had taken a score of peasants of\nwhom they wished to make an example in order to frighten the\nvillagers, who were picking off the French foraging parties and\nwere making war as well as the detachments of regular troops.\nThey ranged them against a wall and read their sentence in\nRussian.  They waited for them to beg for mercy: instead of that\nthey took farewell of one another and made their sign of the\ncross.  The French fired on the first of them; they waited for\nthe rest to beg for pardon in their terror, and to promise to\nchange their conduct.  They fired on the second, and on the\nthird, and so on all the twenty, without a single one having\nattempted to implore the clemency of the enemy.  Napoleon has\nnot once had the pleasure of profaning this word in Russia.''\n\nAmong the characteristics of the popular mind we must mention\nthat in all peoples and all ages it has been saturated\nwith mysticism.  The people will always be convinced that\nsuperior beings--divinities, Governments, or great men--have the\npower to change things at will.  This mystic side produces an\nintense need of adoration.  The people must have a fetich, either\na man or a doctrine.  This is why, when threatened with anarchy,\nit calls for a Messiah to save it.\n\nLike the crowd, but more slowly, the people readily passes from\nadoration to hatred.  A man may be the hero of the people at one\nperiod, and finally earn its curses.  These variations of popular\nopinion concerning political personalities may be observed in all\ntimes.  The history of Cromwell furnishes us with a very curious\nexample.[5]\n\n\n[5] After having overthrown a dynasty and refused a crown he was\nburied like a king among kings.  Two years later his body was\ntorn from the tomb, and his head, cut off by the executioner, was\nexposed above the gate of the House of Parliament.  A little\nwhile ago a statue was raised to him.  The old anarchist turned\nautocrat now figures in the gallery of demigods.\n\n\n\n4.  The Role of the Leader in Revolutionary Movements.\n\n\nAll the varieties of crowds--homogeneous and heterogeneous,\nassemblies, peoples, clubs, &c.--are, as we have often repeated,\naggregates incapable of unity and action so long as they find no\nmaster to lead them.\n\nI have shown elsewhere, making use of certain physiological\nexperiments, that the unconscious collective mind of the crowd\nseems bound up with the mind of the leader.  The latter gives it\na single will and imposes absolute obedience.\n\nThe leader acts especially through suggestion.  His success\ndepends on his fashion of provoking this suggestion.  Many\nexperiments have shown to what point a collectivity may be\nsubjected to suggestion.[6]\n\n\n[6] Among the numerous experiments made to prove this fact one of\nthe most remarkable was performed on the pupils of his class by\nProfessor Glosson and published in the Revue Scientifique for\nOctober 28, 1899.\n\n``I prepared a bottle filled with distilled water carefully\nwrapped in cotton and packed in a box.  After several other\nexperiments I stated that I wished to measure the rapidity with\nwhich an odour would diffuse itself through the air, and asked\nthose present to raise their hands the moment they perceived the\nodour. . . .  I took out the bottle and poured the water on the\ncotton, turning my head away during the operation, then took up a\nstop-watch and awaited the result. . . .  I explained that I was\nabsolutely sure that no one present had ever smelt the odour of\nthe chemical composition I had spilt. . . .  At the end of\nfifteen seconds the majority of those in front had held up their\nhands, and in forty seconds the odour had reached the back of the\nhall by fairly regular waves.  About three-quarters of those\npresent declared that they perceived the odour.  A larger number\nwould doubtless have succumbed to suggestion, if at the end of a\nminute I had not been forced to stop the experiment, some of\nthose in the front rows being unpleasantly affected by the odour,\nand wishing to leave the hall.''\n\n\n\nAccording to the suggestions of the leaders, the multitude will\nbe calm, furious, criminal, or heroic.  These various suggestions\nmay sometimes appear to present a rational aspect, but they will\nonly appear to be reasonable.  A crowd is in reality inaccessible\nto reason; the only ideas capable of influencing it will always\nbe sentiments evoked in the form of images.\n\nThe history of the Revolution shows on every page how easily the\nmultitude follows the most contradictory impulses given by\nits different leaders.  We see it applaud just as vigorously at\nthe triumph of the Girondists, the Hebertists, the Dantonists,\nand the Terrorists as at their successive downfalls.  One may be\nquite sure, also, that the crowd understood nothing of these\nevents.\n\nAt a distance one can only confusedly perceive the part played by\nthe leaders, for they commonly work in the shade.  To grasp this\nclearly we must study them in contemporary events.  We shall then\nsee how readily the leader can provoke the most violent popular\nmovements.  We are not thinking here of the strikes of the\npostmen or railway men, in which the discontent of the employees\nmight intervene, but of events in which the crowd was not in the\nleast interested.  Such, for example, was the popular rising\nprovoked by a few Socialist leaders amidst the Parisian populace\non the morrow of the execution of Ferrer, in Spain.  The French\ncrowd had never heard of Ferrer.  In Spain his execution was\nalmost unnoticed.  In Paris the incitements of a few leaders\nsufficed to hurl a regular popular army upon the Spanish Embassy,\nwith the intention of burning it.  Part of the garrison had to be\nemployed to protect it.  Energetically repulsed, the assailants\ncontented themselves with sacking a few shops and building some\nbarricades.\n\nAt the same time, the leaders gave another proof of their\ninfluence.  Finally understanding that the burning of a foreign\nembassy might be extremely dangerous, they ordered a pacific\ndemonstration for the following day, and were as faithfully\nobeyed as if they had ordered the most violent riot.  No\nexample could better show the importance of leaders and the\nsubmission of the crowd\n\nThe historians who, from Michelet to M. Aulard, have represented\nthe revolutionary crowd as having acted on its own initiative,\nwithout leaders, do not comprehend its psychology.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ASSEMBLIES\n\n1.  Psychological Characteristics of the great Revolutionary\nAssemblies.\n\nA great political assembly, a parliament for example, is a crowd,\nbut a crowd which sometimes fails in effectual action on account\nof the contrary sentiments of the hostile groups composing it.\n\nThe presence of these groups, actuated by different interests,\nmust make us consider an assembly as formed of superimposed and\nheterogeneous crowds, each obeying its particular leaders.  The\nlaw of the mental unity of crowds is manifested only in each\ngroup, and it is only as a result of exceptional circumstances\nthat the different groups act with a single intention.\n\nEach group in an assembly represents a single being.  The\nindividuals contributing to the formation of this being are no\nlonger themselves, and will unhesitatingly vote against their\nconvictions and their wishes.  On the eve of the day when Louis\nXVI. was to be condemned Vergniaud protested with indignation\nagainst the suggestion that he should vote for his death; but he\ndid so vote on the following day.\n\nThe action of a group consists chiefly in fortifying hesitating\nopinions.  All feeble individual convictions become confirmed\nupon becoming collective.\n\nLeaders of great repute or unusual violence can sometimes, by\nacting on all the groups of an assembly, make them a single\ncrowd.  The majority of the members of the Convention enacted\nmeasures entirely contrary to their opinions under the influence\nof a very small number of such leaders.\n\nCollectivities have always given way before active sectaries.\nThe history of the revolutionary Assemblies shows how\npusillanimous they were, despite the boldness of their language\nrespecting kings, before the leaders of the popular riots.  The\ninvasion of a band of energumens commanded by an imperious leader\nwas enough to make them vote then and there the most absurd and\ncontradictory measures.\n\nAn assembly, having the characteristics of a crowd, will, like a\ncrowd, be extreme in its sentiments.  Excessive in its violence,\nit will be excessive in its cowardice.  In general it will be\ninsolent to the weak and servile before the strong.\n\nWe remember the fearful humility of the Parliament when the\nyouthful Louis XIV. entered, whip in hand, to pronounce his brief\nspeech.  We know with what increasing impertinence the\nConstituent Assembly treated Louis XVI. as it felt that he was\nbecoming defenceless.  Finally, we recall the terror of the\nConvention under the reign of Robespierre.\n\nThis characteristic of assemblies being a general law, the\nconvocation of an assembly by a sovereign when his power is\nfailing must be regarded as a gross error in psychology.  The\nassembling of the States General cost the life of Louis\nXVI.  It all but lost Henry III. his throne, when, obliged to\nleave Paris, he had the unhappy idea of assembling the Estates at\nBlois.  Conscious of the weakness of the king, the Estates at\nonce spoke as masters of the situation, modifying taxes,\ndismissing officials, and claiming that their decisions should\nhave the force of law.\n\nThis progressive exaggeration of sentiments was plainly\ndemonstrated in all the assemblies of the Revolution.  The\nConstituent Assembly, at first extremely respectful toward the\nroyal authority and its prerogatives, finally proclaimed itself a\nsovereign Assembly, and treated Louis XVI as a mere official.\nThe Convention, after relatively moderate beginnings, ended with\na preliminary form of the Terror, when judgments were still\nsurrounded by certain legal guarantees: then, quickly increasing\nits powers, it enacted a law depriving all accused persons of the\nright of defence, permitting their condemnation upon the mere\nsuspicion of being suspect.  Yielding more and more to its\nsanguinary frenzy, it finally decimated itself.  Girondists,\nHebertists, Dantonists, and Robespierrists successively ended\ntheir careers at the hands of the executioner.\n\nThis exaggeration of the sentiments of assemblies explains why\nthey were always so little able to control their own destinies\nand why they so often arrived at conclusions exactly contrary to\nthe ends proposed.  Catholic and royalist, the Constituent\nAssembly, instead of the constitutional monarchy it wished to\nestablish and the religion it wished to defend, rapidly led\nFrance to a violent republic and the persecution of the clergy.\n\nPolitical assemblies are composed, as we have seen, of\nheterogeneous groups, but they have sometimes been formed of\nhomogeneous groups, as, for instance, certain of the clubs, which\nplayed so enormous a part during the Revolution, and whose\npsychology deserves a special examination.\n\n\n2.  The Psychology of the Revolutionary Clubs.\n\n\nSmall assemblies of men possessing the same opinions, the same\nbeliefs, and the same interests, which eliminate all dissentient\nvoices, differ from the great assemblies by the unity of their\nsentiments and therefore their wills.  Such were the communes,\nthe religious congregations, the corporations, and the clubs\nduring the Revolution, the secret societies during the first half\nof the nineteenth century, and the Freemasons and syndicalists of\nto-day.\n\nThe points of difference between a heterogeneous assembly and a\nhomogeneous club must be thoroughly grasped if we are to\ncomprehend the progress of the French Revolution.  Until the\nDirectory and especially during the Convention the Revolution was\ndirected by the clubs.\n\nDespite the unity of will due to the absence of dissident parties\nthe clubs obey the laws of the psychology of crowds.  They are\nconsequently subjugated by leaders.  This we see especially in\nthe Jacobin Club, which was dominated by Robespierre.\n\nThe function of the leader of a club, a homogeneous crowd, is far\nmore difficult than that of a leader of a heterogeneous crowd.\nThe latter may easily be led by harping on a small number of\nstrings, but in a homogeneous group like a club, whose\nsentiments and interests are identical, the leader must\nknow how to humour them and is often himself led.\n\nPart of the strength of homogeneous agglomerations resides in\ntheir anonymity.  We know that during the Commune of 1871 a few\nanonymous orders sufficed to effect the burning of the finest\nmonuments of Paris: the Hotel de Ville, the Tuileries, the\nCour des Comptes, the buildings of the Legion of Honour, &c.  A\nbrief order from the anonymous committees, ``Burn Finances, burn\nTuileries,'' &c., was immediately executed.  An unlooked-for\nchance only saved the Louvre and its collections.  We know too\nwhat religious attention is in our days accorded to the most\nabsurd injunctions of the anonymous leaders of the trades unions.\n\nThe clubs of Paris and the insurrectionary Commune were not less\nscrupulously obeyed at the time of the Revolution.  An order\nemanating from these was sufficient to hurl upon the Assembly a\npopular army which dictated its wishes.\n\nSumming up the history of the Convention in another chapter, we\nshall see how frequent were these irruptions, and with what\nservility the Assembly, which according to the legends was so\npowerful bowed itself before the most imperative injunctions of a\nhandful of rioters.  Instructed by experience, the Directory\nclosed the clubs and put an end to the invasion of the populace\nby energetically shooting them down.\n\nThe Convention had early grasped the superiority of homogeneous\ngroups over heterogeneous assemblies in matters of government,\nwhich is why it subdivided itself into committees composed each\nof a limited number of individuals.  These committees--of\nPublic Safety, of Finance, &c.--formed small sovereign assemblies\nin the midst of the larger Assembly.  Their power was held in\ncheck only by that of the clubs.\n\nThe preceding considerations show the power of groups over the\nwills of the members composing them.  If the group is\nhomogeneous, this action is considerable; if it is heterogeneous,\nit is less considerable but may still become important, either\nbecause the more powerful groups of an assembly will dominate\nthose whose cohesion is weaker or because certain contagious\nsentiments will often extend themselves to all the members of an\nassembly.\n\nA memorable example of this influence of groups occurred at the\ntime of the Revolution, when, on the night of the 4th of August,\nthe nobles voted, on the proposition of one of their members, the\nabandonment of feudal privileges.  Yet we know that the\nRevolution resulted in part from the refusal of the clergy and\nthe nobles to renounce their privileges.  Why did they refuse to\nrenounce them at first?  Simply because men in a crowd do not act\nas the same men singly.  Individually no member of the nobility\nwould ever have abandoned his rights.\n\nOf this influence of assemblies upon their members Napoleon at\nSt. Helena cited some curious examples:  ``Nothing was more\ncommon than to meet with men at this period quite unlike the\nreputation that their acts and words would seem to justify.  For\ninstance, one might have supposed Monge to be a terrible fellow;\nwhen war was decided upon he mounted the tribune of the Jacobins\nand declared that he would give his two daughters to the two\nfirst soldiers to be wounded by the enemy.  He wanted the\nnobles to be killed, &c.  Now, Monge was the most gentle and\nfeeble of men, and wouldn't have had a chicken killed if he had\nhad to do it with his own hands, or even to have it done in his\npresence.''\n\n\n3.  A Suggested Explanation of the Progressive Exaggeration of\nSentiments in Assemblies.\n\n\nIf collective sentiments were susceptible of exact quantitative\nmeasurement, we might translate them by a curve which, after a\nfirst gradual ascent, runs upward with extreme rapidity and then\nfalls almost vertically.  The equation of this curve might be\ncalled the equation of the variations of collective sentiments\nsubjected to a constant excitation.\n\nIt is not always easy to explain the acceleration of certain\nsentiments under the influence of a constant exciting cause.\nPerhaps, however, one may say that if the laws of psychology are\ncomparable to those of mechanics, a cause of invariable\ndimensions acting in a continuous fashion will rapidly increase\nthe intensity of a sentiment.  We know, for example, that a force\nwhich is constant in dimension and direction, such as gravity\nacting upon a mass, will cause an accelerated movement.  The\nspeed of a free object falling in space under the influence of\ngravity will be about 32 feet during the first second, 64 feet\nduring the next, 96 feet during the next, &c.  It would be easy,\nwere the moving body allowed to fall from a sufficient height, to\ngive it a velocity sufficient to perforate a plate of steel.\n\nBut although this explanation is applicable to the acceleration\nof a sentiment subjected to a constant exciting cause, it\ndoes not tell us why the effects of acceleration finally and\nsuddenly cease.  Such a fall is only comprehensible if we bring\nin physiological factors--that is, if we remember that pleasure,\nlike pain, cannot exceed certain limits, and that all sensations,\nwhen too violent, result in the paralysis of sensation.  Our\norganism can only support a certain maximum of joy, pain, or\neffort, and it cannot support that maximum for long together.\nThe hand which grasps a dynamometer soon exhausts its effort, and\nis obliged suddenly to let go.\n\nThe study of the causes of the rapid disappearance of certain\ngroups of sentiments in assemblies will remind us of the fact\nthat beside the party which is predominant by means of its\nstrength or prestige there are others whose sentiments,\nrestrained by this force or prestige, have not reached their full\ndevelopment.  Some chance circumstance may somewhat weaken the\nprevailing party, when immediately the suppressed sentiments of\nthe adverse parties may become preponderant.  The Mountain\nlearned this lesson after Thermidor.\n\nAll analogies that we may seek to establish between the laws of\nmaterial phenomena and those which condition the evolution of\naffective and mystic factors are evidently extremely rough.  They\nmust be so until the mechanism of the cerebral functions is\nbetter understood than it is to-day.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\nTHE FRENCH REVOLUTION\n\n\nBOOK I\n\nTHE ORIGINS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE OPINIONS OF HISTORIANS CONCERNING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\n\n1.  The Historians of the Revolution.\n\nThe most contradictory opinions have been expressed respecting\nthe French Revolution, and although only a century separates us\nfrom the period in question it seems impossible as yet to judge\nit calmly.  For de Maistre it was ``a satanic piece of work,''\nand ``never was the action of the spirit of darkness so evidently\nmanifested.''  For the modern Jacobins it has regenerated the\nhuman race.\n\nForeigners who live in France still regard it as a subject to be\navoided in conversation.\n\n``Everywhere,'' writes Barrett Wendell, ``this memory and these\ntraditions are still endowed with such vitality that few persons\nare capable of considering them dispassionately.  They still\nexcite both enthusiasm and resentment; they are still regarded\nwith a loyal and ardent spirit of partisanship.  The better you\ncome to understand France the more clearly you see that even to-\nday no study of the Revolution strikes any Frenchman as\nhaving been impartial.''\n\nThis observation is perfectly correct.  To be interpretable with\nequity, the events of the past must no longer be productive of\nresults and must not touch the religious or political beliefs\nwhose inevitable intolerance I have denoted.\n\nWe must not therefore be surprised that historians express very\ndifferent ideas respecting the Revolution.  For a long time to\ncome some will still see in it one of the most sinister events of\nhistory, while to others it will remain one of the most glorious.\n\nAll writers on the subject have believed that they have related\nits course with impartiality, but in general they have merely\nsupported contradictory theories of peculiar simplicity.  The\ndocuments being innumerable and contradictory, their conscious or\nunconscious choice has readily enabled them to justify their\nrespective theories.\n\nThe older historians of the Revolution--Thiers, Quinet, and,\ndespite his talent, Michelet himself, are somewhat eclipsed to-\nday.  Their doctrines were by no means complicated; a historic\nfatalism prevails generally in their work.  Thiers regarded the\nRevolution as the result of several centuries of absolute\nmonarchy, and the Terror as the necessary consequence of foreign\ninvasion.  Quinet described the excesses of 1793 as the result of\na long-continued despotism, but declared that the tyranny of the\nConvention was unnecessary, and hampered the work of the\nRevolution.  Michelet saw in this last merely the work of the\npeople, whom he blindly admired, and commenced the glorification\ncontinued by other historians.\n\nThe former reputation of all these historians has been to a great\nextent effaced by that of Taine.  Although equally impassioned,\nhe threw a brilliant light upon the revolutionary period, and it\nwill doubtless be long before his work is superseded.\n\nWork so important is bound to show faults.  Taine is admirable in\nthe representation of facts and persons, but he attempts to judge\nby the standard of rational logic events which were not dictated\nby reason, and which, therefore, he cannot interpret.  His\npsychology, excellent when it is merely descriptive, is very weak\nas soon as it becomes explanatory.  To affirm that Robespierre\nwas a pedantic ``swotter'' is not to reveal the causes of his\nabsolute power over the Convention, at a time when he had spent\nseveral months in decimating it with perfect impunity.  It has\nvery justly been said of Taine that he saw well and understood\nlittle.\n\nDespite these restrictions his work is highly remarkable and has\nnot been equalled.  We may judge of his immense influence by the\nexasperation which he causes among the faithful defenders of\nJacobin orthodoxy, of which M. Aulard, professor at the Sorbonne,\nis to-day the high priest.  The latter has devoted two years to\nwriting a pamphlet against Taine, every line of which is steeped\nin passion.  All this time spent in rectifying a few material\nerrors which are not really significant has only resulted in the\nperpetration of the very same errors.\n\nReviewing his work, M. A. Cochin shows that M. Aulard has at\nleast on every other occasion been deceived by his quotations,\nwhereas Taine erred far more rarely.  The same historian shows\nalso that we must not trust M. Aulard's sources.\n\n``These sources--proceedings, pamphlets, journals, and the\nspeeches and writings of patriots--are precisely the authentic\npublications of patriotism, edited by patriots, and edited, as a\nrule, for the benefit of the public.  He ought to have seen in\nall this simply the special pleading of the defendant: he had,\nbefore his eyes, a ready-made history of the Revolution, which\npresents, side by side with each of the acts of the `People,'\nfrom the massacres of September to the law of Prairial, a ready-\nmade explanation according to the republican system of defence.''\n\nPerhaps the fairest criticism that one can make of the work of\nTaine is that it was left incomplete.  He studied more especially\nthe role of the populace and its leaders during the\nrevolutionary period.  This inspired him with pages vibrating\nwith an indignation which we can still admire, but several\nimportant aspects of the Revolution escaped him.\n\nWhatever one may think of the Revolution, an irreducible\ndifference will always exist between historians of the school of\nTaine and those of the school of M. Aulard.  The latter regards\nthe sovereign people as admirable, while the former shows us that\nwhen abandoned to its instincts and liberated from all social\nrestraint it relapses into primitive savagery.  The conception of\nM. Aulard, entirely contrary to the lessons of the psychology of\ncrowds, is none the less a religious dogma in the eyes of modern\nJacobins.  They write of the Revolution according to the methods\nof believers, and take for learned works the arguments of virtual\ntheologians.\n\n2.  The Theory of Fatalism in respect of the Revolution.\n\n\nAdvocates and detractors of the Revolution often admit the\nfatality of revolutionary events.  This theory is well\nsynthetised in the following passage from the History of the\nRevolution, by Emile Olivier:--\n\n``No man could oppose it.  The blame belongs neither to those who\nperished nor to those who survived; there was no individual force\ncapable of changing the elements and of foreseeing the events\nwhich were born of the nature of things and circumstances.''\n\nTaine himself inclines to this idea:--\n\n``At the moment when the States General were opened the course of\nideas and events was not only determined but even visible.  Each\ngeneration unwittingly bears within itself its future and its\npast; from the latter its destinies might have been foretold long\nbefore the issue.''\n\nOther modern authors, who profess no more indulgence for the\nviolence of the revolutionaries than did Taine, are equally\nconvinced of this fatality.  M. Sorel, after recalling the saying\nof Bossuet concerning the revolutions of antiquity:  ``Everything\nis surprising if we only consider particular causes, and yet\neverything goes forward in regular sequence,'' expresses an\nintention which he very imperfectly realises: ``to show in the\nRevolution, which seems to some the subversion and to others the\nregeneration of the old European world, the natural and necessary\nresult of the history of Europe, and to show, moreover, that this\nrevolution had no result--not even the most unexpected--that did\nnot ensue from this history, and was not explained by the\nprecedents of the ancien regime.''\n\nGuizot also had formerly attempted to prove that our Revolution,\nwhich he quite wrongly compared to that of England, was perfectly\nnatural and effected no innovations:--\n\n``Far from having broken with the natural course of events in\nEurope, neither the English revolution nor our own did, intended,\nor said anything that had not been said, intended, and done a\nhundred years before its outbreak.\n\n`` . . . Whether we regard the general doctrines of the two\nrevolutions or the application made of them--whether we deal with\nthe government of the State or with the civil legislation, with\nproperty or with persons, with liberty or with power, we shall\nfind nothing of which the invention can be attributed to them,\nnothing that will not be encountered elsewhere, or that was not\nat least originated in times which we qualify as normal.''\n\nAll these assertions merely recall the banal law that a\nphenomenon is simply the consequence of previous phenomena.  Such\nvery general propositions do not teach us much.\n\nWe must not try to explain too many events by the principle of\nfatality adopted by so many historians.  I have elsewhere\ndiscussed the significance of such fatalities, and have shown\nthat the whole effort of civilisation consists in trying to\nescape therefrom.  Certainly history is full of necessities, but\nit is also full of contingent facts which were, and might not\nhave been.  Napoleon himself, on St. Helena, enumerated six\ncircumstances which might have checked his prodigious career.  He\nrelated, notably, that on taking a bath at Auxonne, in 1786, he\nonly escaped death by the fortuitous presence of a sandbank.  If\nBonaparte had died, then we may admit that another general would\nhave arisen, and might have become dictator.  But what would have\nbecome of the Imperial epic and its consequences without\nthe man of genius who led our victorious armies into all the\ncapitals of Europe?\n\nIt is permissible to consider the Revolution as being partly a\nnecessity, but it was above all--which is what the fatalistic\nwriters already cited do not show us--a permanent struggle\nbetween theorists who were imbued with a new ideal, and the\neconomic, social, and political laws which ruled mankind, and\nwhich they did not understand.  Not understanding them, they\nsought in vain to direct the course of events, were exasperated\nat their failure, and finally committed every species of\nviolence.  They decreed that the paper money known as assignats\nshould be accepted as the equivalent of gold, and all their\nthreats could not prevent the fictitious value of such money\nfalling almost to nothing.  They decreed the law of the maximum,\nand it merely increased the evils it was intended to remedy.\nRobespierre declared before the Convention ``that all the sans-\nculottes will be paid at the expense of the public treasury,\nwhich will be fed by the rich,'' and in spite of requisitions and\nthe guillotine the treasury remained empty.\n\nHaving broken all human restraints, the men of the Revolution\nfinally discovered that a society cannot live without them; but\nwhen they sought to create them anew they saw that even the\nstrongest society, though supported by the fear of the\nguillotine, could not replace the discipline which the past had\nslowly built up in the minds of men.  As for understanding the\nevolution of society, or judging men's hearts and minds, or\nforeseeing the consequences of the laws they enacted, they\nscarcely attempted to do so.\n\nThe events of the Revolution did not ensue from\nirreducible necessities.  They were far more the consequence of\nJacobin principles than of circumstances, and might have been\nquite other than they were.  Would the Revolution have followed\nthe same path if Louis XVI. had been better advised, or if the\nConstituent Assembly had been less cowardly in times of popular\ninsurrection?  The theory of revolutionary fatality is only\nuseful to justify violence by presenting it as inevitable.\n\nWhether we are dealing with science or with history we must\nbeware of the ignorance which takes shelter under the shibboleth\nof fatalism Nature was formerly full of a host of fatalities\nwhich science is slowly contriving to avoid.  The function of the\nsuperior man is, as I have shown elsewhere, to avert such\nfatalities.\n\n\n3.  The Hesitations of recent Historians of the Revolution.\n\n\nThe historians whose ideas we have examined in the preceding\nchapter were extremely positive in their special pleading.\nConfined within the limits of belief, they did not attempt to\npenetrate the domain of knowledge.  A monarchical writer was\nviolently hostile to the Revolution, and a liberal writer was its\nviolent apologist.\n\nAt the present time we can see the commencement of a movement\nwhich will surely lead to the study of the Revolution as one of\nthose scientific phenomena into which the opinions and beliefs of\na writer enter so little that the reader does not even suspect\nthem.\n\nThis period has not yet come into being; we are still in the\nperiod of doubt.  The liberal writers who used to be so positive\nare now so no longer.  One may judge of this new state of\nmind by the following extracts from recent authors:--\n\nM. Hanotaux, having vaunted the utility of the Revolution, asks\nwhether its results were not bought too dearly, and adds:--\n\n``History hesitates, and will, for a long time yet, hesitate to\nanswer.''\n\nM. Madelin is equally dubious in the book he has recently\npublished:--\n\n``I have never felt sufficient authority to form, even in my\ninmost conscience, a categorical judgment on so complex a\nphenomenon as the French Revolution.  To-day I find it even more\ndifficult to form a brief judgement.  Causes, facts, and\nconsequences seem to me to be still extremely debatable\nsubjects.''\n\nOne may obtain a still better idea of the transformation of the\nold ideas concerning the Revolution by perusing the latest\nwritings of its official defenders.  While they professed\nformerly to justify every act of violence by representing it as a\nsimple act of defence, they now confine themselves to pleading\nextenuating circumstances.  I find a striking proof of this new\nframe of mind in the history of France for the use of schools,\npublished by MM. Aulard and Debidour.  Concerning the Terror we\nread the following lines:--\n\n``Blood flowed in waves; there were acts of injustice and crimes\nwhich were useless from the point of view of national defence,\nand odious.  But men had lost their heads in the tempest, and,\nharassed by a thousand dangers, the patriots struck out in their\nrage.''\n\nWe shall see in another part of this work that the first of the\ntwo authors whom I have cited is, in spite of his\nuncompromising Jacobinism, by no means indulgent toward the men\nformerly qualified as the ``Giants of the Convention.''\n\nThe judgments of foreigners upon our Revolution are usually\ndistinctly severe, and we cannot be surprised when we remember\nhow Europe suffered during the twenty years of upheaval in\nFrance.\n\nThe Germans in particular have been most severe.  Their opinion\nis summed up in the following lines by M. Faguet:--\n\n``Let us say it courageously and patriotically, for patriotism\nconsists above all in telling the truth to one's own country:\nGermany sees in France, with regard to the past, a people who,\nwith the great words `liberty' and `fraternity' in its mouth,\noppressed, trampled, murdered, pillaged, and fleeced her for\nfifteen years; and with regard to the present, a people who, with\nthe same words on its banners, is organising a despotic,\noppressive, mischievous, and ruinous democracy, which none would\nseek to imitate.  This is what Germany may well see in France;\nand this, according to her books and journals, is, we may assure\nourselves, what she does see.''\n\nFor the rest, whatever the worth of the verdicts pronounced upon\nthe French Revolution, we may be certain that the writers of the\nfuture will consider it as an event as passionately interesting\nas it is instructive.\n\nA Government bloodthirsty enough to guillotine old men of eighty\nyears, young girls, and little children: which covered France\nwith ruins, and yet succeeded in repulsing Europe in arms; an\narchduchess of Austria, Queen of France, dying on the\nscaffold, and a few years later another archduchess, her\nrelative, replacing her on the same throne and marrying a sub-\nlieutenant, turned Emperor--here are tragedies unique in human\nhistory.  The psychologists, above all, will derive lessons from\na history hitherto so little studied by them.  No doubt they will\nfinally discover that psychology can make no progress until it\nrenounces chimerical theories and laboratory experiments in order\nto study the events and the men who surround us.[7]\n\n\n\n[7] This advice is far from being banal.  The psychologists of\nthe day pay very little attention to the world about them, and\nare even surprised that any one should study it.  I have come\nacross an interesting proof of this indifferent frame of mind in\na review of one of my books which appeared in the Revue\nphilosophique and was inspired by the editor of the review.  The\nauthor reproaches me with ``exploring the world and the\nnewspapers rather than books.''\n\nI most gladly accept this reproach.  The manifold facts of the\njournals and the realities of the world are far more instructive\nthan philosophical lucubrations such as the Revue is stuffed\nwith.\n\nPhilosophers are beginning to see the puerility of such\nreproaches.  It was certainly of the forty volumes of this\nfastidious publication that Mr. William James was thinking when\nhe wrote that all these dissertations simply represented ``a\nstring of facts clumsily observed and a few quarrelsome\ndiscussions.''  Although he is the author of the best known\ntreatise on psychology extant, the eminent thinker realises ``the\nfragility of a science that oozes metaphysical criticism at every\njoint.''  For more than twenty years I have tried to interest\npsychologists in the study of realities, but the stream of\nuniversity metaphysics is hardly yet turned aside, although it\nhas lost its former force\n\n\n\n4.  Impartiality in History.\n\n\nImpartiality has always been considered as the most essential\nquality of the historian.  All historians since Tacitus have\nassured us that they are impartial.\n\nIn reality the writer sees events as the painter sees a\nlandscape--that is, through his own temperament; through his\ncharacter and the mind of the race.\n\nA number of artists, placed before the same landscape, would\nnecessarily interpret it in as many different fashions.  Some\nwould lay stress upon details neglected by others.  Each\nreproduction would thus be a personal work--that is to say, would\nbe interpreted by a certain form of sensibility.\n\nIt is the same with the writer.  We can no more speak of the\nimpartiality of the historian than we can speak of the\nimpartiality of the painter.\n\nCertainly the historian may confine himself to the reproduction\nof documents, and this is the present tendency.  But these\ndocuments, for periods as near us as the Revolution, are so\nabundant that a man's whole life would not suffice to go through\nthem.  Therefore the historian must make a choice.\n\nConsciously sometimes, but more often unconsciously, the author\nwill select the material which best corresponds with his\npolitical, moral, and social opinions.\n\nIt is therefore impossible, unless he contents himself with\nsimple chronologies summing up each event with a few words and a\ndate, to produce a truly impartial volume of history.  No author\ncould be impartial; and it is not to be regretted.  The claim to\nimpartiality, so common to-day, results in those flat, gloomy,\nand prodigiously wearisome works which render the comprehension\nof a period completely impossible.\n\nShould the historian, under a pretext of impartiality, abstain\nfrom judging men--that is, from speaking in tones of admiration\nor reprobation?\n\nThis question, I admit, allows of two very different solutions,\neach of which is perfectly correct, according to the point of\nview assumed--that of the moralist or that of the psychologist.\n\nThe moralist must think exclusively of the interest of society,\nand must judge men only according to that interest.  By the very\nfact that it exists and wishes to continue to exist a society is\nobliged to admit a certain number of rules, to have an\nindestructible standard of good and evil, and consequently to\ncreate very definite distinctions between vice and virtue.  It\nthus finally creates average types, to which the man of the\nperiod approaches more or less closely, and from which he cannot\ndepart very widely without peril to society.\n\nIt is by such similar types and the rules derived from social\nnecessities that the moralist must judge the men of the past.\nPraising those which were useful and blaming the rest, he thus\nhelps to form the moral types which are indispensable to the\nprogress of civilisation and which may serve others as models.\nPoets such as Corneille, for example, create heroes superior to\nthe majority of men, and possibly inimitable; but they thereby\nhelp greatly to stimulate our efforts.  The example of heroes\nmust always be set before a people in order to ennoble its mind.\n\nSuch is the moralist's point of view.  That of the psychologist\nwould be quite different.  While a society has no right to be\ntolerant, because its first duty is to live, the psychologist may\nremain indifferent.  Considering things as a scientist, he no\nlonger asks their utilitarian value, but seeks merely to explain\nthem.\n\nHis situation is that of the observer before any phenomenon.  It\nis obviously difficult to read in cold blood that Carrier ordered\nhis victims to be buried up to the neck so that they might then\nbe blinded and subjected to horrible torments.  Yet if we wish to\ncomprehend such acts we must be no more indignant than the\nnaturalist before the spider slowly devouring a fly.  As soon as\nthe reason is moved it is no longer reason, and can explain\nnothing.\n\nThe functions of the historian and the psychologist are not, as\nwe see, identical, but of both we may demand the endeavour, by a\nwise interpretation of the facts, to discover, under the visible\nevidences, the invisible forces which determine them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE PSYCHOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE ANCIEN REGIME\n\n1.  The Absolute Monarchy and the Bases of the Ancien Regime.\n\nMany historians assure us that the Revolution was directed\nagainst the autocracy of the monarchy.  In reality the kings of\nFrance had ceased to be absolute monarchs long before its\noutbreak.\n\nOnly very late in history--not until the reign of Louis XIV.--did\nthey finally obtain incontestable power.  All the preceding\nsovereigns, even the most powerful, such as Francis I., for\nexample, had to sustain a constant struggle either against the\nseigneurs, or the clergy, or the parliaments, and they did not\nalways win.  Francis himself had not sufficient power to protect\nhis most intimate friends against the Sorbonne and the\nParliament.  His friend and councillor Berquin, having offended\nthe Sorbonne, was arrested upon the order of the latter body.\nThe king ordered his release, which was refused.  He was obliged\nto send archers to remove him from the Conciergerie, and could\nfind no other means of protecting him than that of keeping him\nbeside him in the Louvre.  The Sorbonne by no means considered\nitself beaten.  Profiting by the king's absence, it\narrested Berquin again and had him tried by Parliament.\nCondemned at ten in the morning, he was burned alive at noon.\n\nBuilt up very gradually, the power of the kings of France was not\nabsolute until the time of Louis XIV.  It then rapidly declined,\nand it would be truly difficult to speak of the absolutism of\nLouis XVI.\n\nThis pretended master was the slave of his court, his ministers,\nthe clergy, and the nobles.  He did what they forced him to do\nand rarely what he wished.  Perhaps no Frenchman was so little\nfree as the king.\n\nThe great power of the monarchy resided originally in the Divine\norigin which was attributed to it, and in the traditions which\nhad accumulated during the ages.  These formed the real social\nframework of the country.\n\nThe true cause of the disappearance of the ancien regime was\nsimply the weakening of the traditions which served as its\nfoundations.  When after repeated criticism it could find no more\ndefenders, the ancien regime crumbled like a building whose\nfoundations have been destroyed.\n\n\n2.  The Inconveniences of the Ancien Regime\n\n\nA long-established system of government will always finally seem\nacceptable to the people governed.  Habit masks its\ninconveniences, which appear only when men begin to think.  Then\nthey ask how they could ever have supported them.  The truly\nunhappy man is the man who believes himself miserable.\n\nIt was precisely this belief which was gaining ground at the time\nof the Revolution, under the influence of the writers whose work\nwe shall presently study.  Then the imperfections of the\nancien regime stared all men in the face.  They were\nnumerous; it is enough to mention a few.\n\nDespite the apparent authority of the central power, the kingdom,\nformed by the successive conquest of independent provinces, was\ndivided into territories each of which had its own laws and\ncustoms, and each of which paid different imposts.  Internal\ncustoms-houses separated them.  The unity of France was thus\nsomewhat artificial.  It represented an aggregate of various\ncountries which the repeated efforts of the kings, including\nLouis XIV., had not succeeded in wholly unifying.  The most\nuseful effect of the Revolution was this very unification.\n\nTo such material divisions were added social divisions\nconstituted by different classes--nobles, clergy, and the Third\nEstate, whose rigid barriers could only with the utmost\ndifficulty be crossed.\n\nRegarding the division of the classes as one of its sources of\npower, the ancien regime had rigorously maintained that\ndivision.  This became the principal cause of the hatreds which\nthe system inspired.  Much of the violence of the triumphant\nbourgeoisie represented vengeance for a long past of disdain\nand oppression.  The wounds of self-love are the most difficult\nof all to forget.  The Third Estate had suffered many such\nwounds.  At a meeting of the States General in 1614, at which its\nrepresentatives were obliged to remain bareheaded on their knees,\none member of the Third Estate having dared to say that the three\norders were like three brothers, the spokesman of the nobles\nreplied ``that there was no fraternity between it and the Third;\nthat the nobles did not wish the children of cobblers and\ntanners to call them their brothers.''\n\nDespite the march of enlightenment the nobles and the clergy\nobstinately preserved their privileges and their demands, no\nlonger justifiable now that these classes had ceased to render\nservices.\n\nKept from the exercise of public functions by the royal power,\nwhich distrusted them, and progressively replaced by a\nbourgeoisie which was more and more learned and capable, the\nsocial role of nobility and clergy was only an empty show.\nThis point has been luminously expounded by Taine:--\n\n``Since the nobility, having lost its special capacity, and the\nThird Estate, having acquired general capacity, were now on a\nlevel in respect of education and aptitudes, the inequality which\ndivided them had become hurtful and useless.  Instituted by\ncustom, it was no longer ratified by the consciousness, and the\nThird Estate was with reason angered by privileges which nothing\njustified, neither the capacity of the nobles nor the incapacity\nof the bourgeoisie.''\n\nBy reason of the rigidity of castes established by a long past we\ncannot see what could have persuaded the nobles and the clergy to\nrenounce their privileges.  Certainly they did finally abandon\nthem one memorable evening, when events forced them to do so; but\nthen it was too late, and the Revolution, unchained, was pursuing\nits course.\n\nIt is certain that modern progress would successively have\nestablished all that the Revolution effected--the equality of\ncitizens before the law, the suppression of the privileges of\nbirth, &c.  Despite the conservative spirit of the Latins, these\nthings would have been won, as they were by the majority\nof the peoples.  We might in this manner have been saved twenty\nyears of warfare and devastation; but we must have had a\ndifferent mental constitution, and, above all, different\nstatesmen.\n\nThe profound hostility of the bourgeoisie against the classes\nmaintained above it by tradition was one of the great factors of\nthe Revolution, and perfectly explains why, after its triumph,\nthe first class despoiled the vanquished of their wealth.  They\nbehaved as conquerors--like William the Conqueror, who, after the\nconquest of England, distributed the soil among his soldiers.\n\nBut although the bourgeoisie detested the nobility they had no\nhatred for royalty, and did not regard it as revocable.  The\nmaladdress of the king and his appeals to foreign powers only\nvery gradually made him unpopular.\n\nThe first Assembly never dreamed of founding a republic.\nExtremely royalist, in fact, it thought simply to substitute a\nconstitutional for an absolute monarchy.  Only the consciousness\nof its increasing power exasperated it against the resistance of\nthe king; but it dared not overthrow him.\n\n\n3.  Life under the Ancien Regime.\n\n\nIt is difficult to form a very clear idea of life under the\nancien regime, and, above all, of the real situation of the\npeasants.\n\nThe writers who defend the Revolution as theologians defend\nreligious dogmas draw such gloomy pictures of the existence of\nthe peasants under the ancien regime that we ask ourselves\nhow it was that all these unhappy creatures had not died\nof hunger long before.  A good example of this style of writing\nmay be found in a book by M. A. Rambaud, formerly professor at\nthe Sorbonne, published under the title History of the French\nRevolution.  One notices especially an engraving bearing the\nlegend, Poverty of Peasants under Louis XIV.  In the foreground\na man is fighting some dogs for some bones, which for that matter\nare already quite fleshless.  Beside him a wretched fellow is\ntwisting himself and compressing his stomach.  Farther back a\nwoman lying on the ground is eating grass.  At the back of the\nlandscape figures of which one cannot say whether they are\ncorpses or persons starving are also stretched on the soil.  As\nan example of the administration of the ancien regime the\nsame author assures us that ``a place in the police cost 300\nlivres and brought in 400,000.''  Such figures surely indicate a\ngreat disinterestedness on the part of those who sold such\nproductive employment!  He also informs us ``that it cost only\n120 livres to get people arrested,'' and that ``under Louis XV.\nmore than 150,000 lettres de cachet were distributed.''\n\nThe majority of books dealing with the Revolution are conceived\nwith as little impartiality and critical spirit, which is one\nreason why this period is really so little known to us.\n\nCertainly there is no lack of documents, but they are absolutely\ncontradictory.  To the celebrated description of La Bruyere we\nmay oppose the enthusiastic picture drawn by the English\ntraveller Young of the prosperous condition of the peasants of\nsome of the French provinces.\n\nWere they really crushed by taxation, and did they, as has been\nstated, pay four-fifths of their revenue instead of a fifth as\nto-day?  Impossible to say with certainty.  One capital fact,\nhowever, seems to prove that under the ancien regime the\nsituation of the inhabitants of the rural districts could not\nhave been so very wretched, since it seems established that more\nthan a third of the soil had been bought by peasants.\n\nWe are better informed as to the financial system.  It was very\noppressive and extremely complicated.  The budgets usually showed\ndeficits, and the imposts of all kinds were raised by tyrannical\nfarmers-general.  At the very moment of the Revolution this\ncondition of the finances became the cause of universal\ndiscontent, which is expressed in the cahiers of the States\nGeneral.  Let us remark that these cahiers did not represent a\nprevious state of affairs, but an actual condition due to a\ncrisis of poverty produced by the bad harvest of 1788 and the\nhard winter of 1789.  What would these cahiers have told us had\nthey been written ten years earlier?\n\nDespite these unfavourable circumstances the cahiers contained\nno revolutionary ideas.  The most advanced merely asked that\ntaxes should be imposed only with the consent of the States\nGeneral and paid by all alike.  The same cahiers sometimes\nexpressed a wish that the power of the king should be limited by\na Constitution defining his rights and those of the nation.  If\nthese wishes had been granted a constitutional monarchy could\nvery easily have been substituted for the absolute monarchy, and\nthe Revolution would probably have been avoided.\n\nUnhappily, the nobility and the clergy were too strong and Louis\nXVI. too weak for such a solution to be possible.\n\nMoreover, it would have been rendered extremely difficult by the\ndemands of the bourgeoisie, who claimed to substitute themselves\nfor the nobles, and were the real authors of the Revolution.  The\nmovement started by the middle classes rapidly exceeded their\nhopes, needs, and aspirations.  They had claimed equality for\ntheir own profit, but the people also demanded equality.  The\nRevolution thus finally became the popular government which it\nwas not and had no intention of becoming at the outset.\n\n\n4.  Evolution of Monarchical Feeling during the Revolution.\n\n\nDespite the slow evolution of the affective elements, it is\ncertain that during the Revolution the sentiments, not of the\npeople only, but also of the revolutionary Assemblies with regard\nto the monarchy, underwent a very rapid change.  Between the\nmoment when the legislators of the first Assembly surrounded\nLouis XVI. with respect and the moment when his head was cut off\na very few years had elapsed.\n\nThese changes, superficial rather than profound, were in reality\na mere transposition of sentiments of the same order.  The love\nwhich the men of this period professed for the king was\ntransferred to the new Government which had inherited his power.\nThe mechanism of such a transfer may easily be demonstrated.\n\nUnder the ancien regime, the sovereign, holding his power by\nDivine right, was for this reason invested with a kind of\nsupernatural power.  His people looked up to him from every\ncorner of the country.\n\nThis mystic belief in the absolute power of royalty was shattered\nonly when repeated experience proved that the power attributed to\nthe adored being was fictitious.  He then lost his prestige.\nNow, when prestige is lost the crowd will not forgive the fallen\nidol for deluding them, and seek anew the idol without which they\ncannot exist.\n\nFrom the outset of the Revolution numerous facts, which were\ndaily repeated, revealed to the most fervent believers the fact\nthat royalty no longer possessed any power, and that there were\nother powers capable, not only of contending with royalty, but\npossessed of superior force.\n\nWhat, for instance, was thought of the royal power by the\nmultitudes who saw the king held in check by the Assembly, and\nincapable, in the heart of Paris, of defending his strongest\nfortress against the attacks of armed bands?\n\nThe royal weakness thus being obvious, the power of the Assembly\nwas increasing.  Now, in the eyes of the crowd weakness has no\nprestige; it turns always to force.\n\nIn the Assemblies feeling was very fluid, but did not evolve very\nrapidly, for which reason the monarchical faith survived the\ntaking of the Bastille the flight of the king, and his\nunderstanding with foreign sovereigns.\n\nThe royalist faith was still so powerful that the Parisian riots\nand the events which led to the execution of Louis XVI. were not\nenough finally to destroy, in the provinces, the species\nof secular piety which enveloped the old monarchy.[8]\n\n\n\n[8] As an instance of the depth of this hereditary love of the\npeople for its kings, Michelet relates the following fact, which\noccurred in the reign of Louis XV.:  ``When it was known in Paris\nthat Louis XV., who had left for the army, was detained ill at\nMetz, it was night.  People got up and ran tumultuously hither\nand thither without knowing where they were going; the churches\nwere opened in the middle of the night . . . people assembled at\nevery cross-road, jostling and questioning one another without\nknowing what they were after.  In several churches the priest who\nwas reciting the prayer for the king's health was stopped by his\ntears, and the people replied by sobs and cries. . . .  The\ncourier who brought the news of his convalescence was embraced\nand almost stifled; people kissed his horse, and led him in\ntriumph. . . .  Every street resounded with a cry of joy:  `The\nking is healed.' ''\n\n\n\n\nIt persisted in a great part of France during the whole of the\nRevolution, and was the origin of the royalist conspiracies and\ninsurrections in various departments which the Convention had\nsuch trouble to suppress.  The royalist faith had disappeared in\nParis, where the weakness of the king was too plainly visible;\nbut in the provinces the royal power, representing God on earth,\nstill retained its prestige.\n\nThe royalist sentiments of the people must have been deeply\nrooted to survive the guillotine.  The royalist movements\npersisted, indeed, during the whole of the Revolution, and were\naccentuated under the Directory, when forty-nine departments sent\nroyalist deputies to Paris, which provoked the Directory to the\ncoup d'etat of Fructidor.\n\nThis monarchical-feeling, with difficulty repressed by the\nRevolution, contributed to the success of Bonaparte when he came\nto occupy the throne of the ancient kings, and in great measure\nto re-establish the ancien regime.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nMENTAL ANARCHY AT THE TIME OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE INFLUENCE\nATTRIBUTED TO THE PHILOSOPHERS\n\n1.  Origin and Propagation of Revolutionary Ideas.\n\nThe outward life of men in every age is moulded upon an inward\nlife consisting of a framework of traditions, sentiments, and\nmoral influences which direct their conduct and maintain certain\nfundamental notions which they accept without discussion.\n\nLet the resistance of this social framework weaken, and ideas\nwhich could have had no force before will germinate and develop.\nCertain theories whose success was enormous at the time of the\nRevolution would have encountered an impregnable wall two\ncenturies earlier.\n\nThe aim of these considerations is to recall to the reader the\nfact that the outward events of revolutions are always a\nconsequence of invisible transformations which have slowly gone\nforward in men's minds.  Any profound study of a revolution\nnecessitates a study of the mental soil upon which the ideas that\ndirect its course have to germinate.\n\nGenerally slow in the extreme, the evolution of ideas is often\ninvisible for a whole generation.  Its extent can only be grasped\nby comparing the mental condition of the same social\nclasses at the two extremities of the curve which the mind has\nfollowed.  To realise the different conceptions of royalty\nentertained by educated men under Louis XIV. and Louis XVI., we\nmust compare the political theories of Bossuet and Turgot.\n\nBossuet expressed the general conceptions of his time concerning\nthe absolute monarchy when he based the authority of a Government\nupon the will of God, ``sole judge of the actions of kings,\nalways irresponsible before men.''  Religious faith was then as\nstrong as the monarchical faith from which it seemed inseparable,\nand no philosopher could have shaken it.\n\nThe writings of the reforming ministers of Louis XVI., those of\nTurgot, for instance, are animated by quite another spirit.  Of\nthe Divine right of kings there is hardly a word, and the rights\nof the peoples begin to be clearly defined.\n\nMany events had contributed to prepare for such an evolution--\nunfortunate wars, famines, imposts, general poverty at the end of\nthe reign of Louis XV., &c.  Slowly destroyed, respect for\nmonarchical authority was replaced by a mental revolt which was\nready to manifest itself as soon as occasion should arise.\n\nWhen once the mental framework commences to crumble the end comes\nrapidly.  This is why at the time of the Revolution ideas were so\nquickly propagated which were by no means new, but which until\nthen had exerted no influence, as they had not fallen on fruitful\nground.\n\nYet the ideas which were then so attractive and effectual had\noften been expressed.  For a long time they had inspired the\npolitics of England.  Two thousand years earlier the Greek and\nLatin authors had written in defence of liberty, had\ncursed tyrants, and proclaimed the rights of popular sovereignty.\n\nThe middle classes who effected the Revolution, although, like\ntheir fathers, they had learned all these things in text-books,\nwere not in any degree moved by them, because the moment when\nsuch ideas could move them had not arrived.  How should the\npeople have been impressed by them at a time when all men were\naccustomed to regard all hierarchies as natural necessities?\n\nThe actual influence of the philosophers in the genesis of the\nRevolution was not that which was attributed to them.  They\nrevealed nothing new, but they developed the critical spirit\nwhich no dogma can resist once the way is prepared for its\ndownfall.\n\nUnder the influence of this developing critical spirit things\nwhich were no longer very greatly respected came to be respected\nless and less.  When tradition and prestige had disappeared the\nsocial edifice suddenly fell.\n\nThis progressive disaggregation finally descended to the people,\nbut was not commenced by the people.  The people follows\nexamples, but never sets them.\n\nThe philosophers, who could not have exerted any influence over\nthe people, did exert a great influence over the enlightened\nportion of the nation.  The unemployed nobility, who had long\nbeen ousted from their old functions, and who were consequently\ninclined to be censorious, followed their leadership.  Incapable\nof foresight, the nobles were the first to break with the\ntraditions that were their only raison d'etre.  As steeped\nin humanitarianism and rationalism as the bourgeoisie of to-\nday, they continually sapped their own privileges by their\ncriticisms.  As to-day, the most ardent reformers were found\namong the favourites of fortune.  The aristocracy encouraged\ndissertations on the social contract, the rights of man, and the\nequality of citizens.  At the theatre it applauded plays which\ncriticised privileges, the arbitrariness and the incapacity of\nmen in high places, and abuses of all kinds.\n\nAs soon as men lose confidence in the foundations of the mental\nframework which guides their conduct they feel at first uneasy\nand then discontented.  All classes felt their old motives of\naction gradually disappearing.  Things that had seemed sacred for\ncenturies were now sacred no longer.\n\nThe censorious spirit of the nobility and of the writers of the\nday would not have sufficed to move the heavy load of tradition,\nbut that its action was added to that of other powerful\ninfluences.  We have already stated, in citing Bossuet, that\nunder the ancien regime the religious and civil governments,\nwidely separated in our days, were intimately connected.  To\ninjure one was inevitably to injure the other.  Now, even before\nthe monarchical idea was shaken the force of religious tradition\nwas greatly diminished among cultivated men.  The constant\nprogress of knowledge had sent an increasing number of minds from\ntheology to science by opposing the truth observed to the truth\nrevealed.\n\nThis mental evolution, although as yet very vague, was sufficient\nto show that the traditions which for so many centuries had\nguided men had not the value which had been attributed to them,\nand that it would soon be necessary to replace them.\n\nBut where discover the new elements which might; take the place\nof tradition?  Where seek the magic ring which would raise a new\nsocial edifice on the remains of that which no longer contented\nmen?\n\nMen were agreed in attributing to reason the power that tradition\nand the gods seemed to have lost.  How could its force be\ndoubted?  Its discoveries having been innumerable, was it not\nlegitimate to suppose that by applying it to the construction of\nsocieties it would entirely transform them?  Its possible\nfunction increased very rapidly in the thoughts of the more\nenlightened, in proportion as tradition seemed more and more to\nbe distrusted.\n\nThe sovereign power attributed to reason must be regarded as the\nculminating idea which not only engendered the Revolution but\ngoverned it throughout.  During the whole Revolution men gave\nthemselves up to the most persevering efforts to break with the\npast, and to erect society upon a new plan dictated by logic.\n\nSlowly filtering downward, the rationalistic theories of the\nphilosophers meant to the people simply that all the things which\nhad been regarded as worthy of respect were now no longer worthy.\n\nMen being declared equal, the old masters need no longer be\nobeyed.\n\nThe multitude easily succeeded in ceasing to respect what the\nupper classes themselves no longer respected.  When the barrier\nof respect was down the Revolution was accomplished.\n\nThe first result of this new mentality was a general\ninsubordination.  Mme. Vigee Lebrun relates that on the\npromenade at Longchamps men of the people leaped on the\nfootboards of the carriages, saying, ``Next year you will be\nbehind and we shall be inside.''\n\nThe populace was not alone in manifesting insubordination and\ndiscontent.  These sentiments were general on the eve of the\nRevolution.  ``The lesser clergy,'' says Taine, ``are hostile to\nthe prelates; the provincial gentry to the nobility of the court;\nthe vassals to the seigneurs; the peasants to the townsmen,'' &c.\n\nThis state of mind, which had been communicated from the nobles\nand clergy to the people, also invaded the army.  At the moment\nthe States General were opened Necker said:  ``We are not sure of\nthe troops.''  The officers were becoming humanitarian and\nphilosophical.  The soldiers, recruited from the lowest class of\nthe population, did not philosophise, but they no longer obeyed.\n\nIn their feeble minds the ideas of equality meant simply the\nsuppression of all leaders and masters, and therefore of all\nobedience.  In 1790 more than twenty regiments threatened their\nofficers, and sometimes, as at Nancy, threw them into prison.\n\nThe mental anarchy which, after spreading through all the classes\nof society, finally invaded the army was the principal cause of\nthe disappearance of the ancien regime.  ``It was the\ndefection of the army affected by the ideas of the Third\nEstate,'' wrote Rivarol, ``that destroyed royalty.''\n\n\n2.  The supposed Influence of the Philosophers of the Eighteenth\nCentury upon the Genesis of the Revolution--Their dislike of\nDemocracy.\n\n\nAlthough the philosophers who have been supposed the inspirers of\nthe French Revolution did attack certain privileges and\nabuses, we must not for that reason regard them as partisans of\npopular government.  Democracy, whose role in Greek history\nwas familiar to them, was generally highly antipathetic to them.\nThey were not ignorant of the destruction and violence which are\nits invariable accompaniments, and knew that in the time of\nAristotle it was already defined as ``a State in which\neverything, even the law, depends on the multitude set up as a\ntyrant and governed by a few declamatory speakers.''\n\nPierre Bayle, the true forerunner of Voltaire, recalled in the\nfollowing terms the consequences of popular government in\nAthens:--\n\n``If one considers this history, which displays at great length\nthe tumult of the assemblies, the factions dividing the city, the\nseditious disturbing it, the most illustrious subjects\npersecuted, exiled, and punished by death at the will of a\nviolent windbag, one would conclude that this people, which so\nprided itself on its liberty, was really the slave of a small\nnumber of caballers, whom they called demagogues, and who made it\nturn now in this direction, now in that, as their passions\nchanged, almost as the sea heaps the waves now one way, now\nanother, according to the winds which trouble it.  You will seek\nin vain in Macedonia, which was a monarchy, for as many examples\nof tyranny as Athenian history will afford.''\n\nMontesquieu had no greater admiration for the democracy.  Having\ndescribed the three forms of government--republican, monarchical,\nand despotic--he shows very clearly what popular government may\nlead to:--\n\n``Men were free with laws; men would fain be free without\nthem; what was a maxim is called severity; what was order is\ncalled hindrance.  Formerly the welfare of individuals\nconstituted the public wealth, but now the public wealth becomes\nthe patrimony of individuals.  The republic is spoil, and its\nstrength is merely the power of a few citizens and the licence of\nall.''\n\n``. . . Little petty tyrants spring up who have all the vices of\na single tyrant.  Very soon what is left of liberty becomes\nuntenable; a single tyrant arises, and the people loses all, even\nthe advantages of corruption.\n\n``Democracy has therefore two extremes to avoid; the extreme of\nthe spirit of equality leads to the despotism of a single person,\nas the despotism of a single person leads to conquest.''\n\nThe ideal of Montesquieu was the English constitutional\ngovernment, which prevented the monarchy from degenerating into\ndespotism.  Otherwise the influence of this philosopher at the\nmoment of the Revolution was very slight.\n\nAs for the Encyclopaedists, to whom such a considerable\nrole is attributed, they hardly dealt with politics,\nexcepting d'Holbach, a liberal monarchist like Voltaire and\nDiderot.  They wrote chiefly in defence of individual liberty,\nopposing the encroachments of the Church, at that time extremely\nintolerant and inimical to philosophers.  Being neither\nSocialists nor democrats, the Revolution could not utilise any of\ntheir principles.\n\nVoltaire himself was by no means a partisan of democracy.\n\n``Democracy,'' he said, ``seems only to suit a very small\ncountry, and even then it must be fortunately situated.\nLittle as it may be, it will make many mistakes, because it will\nbe composed of men.  Discord will prevail there as in a convent\nfull of monks; but there will be no St. Bartholomew's day, no\nIrish massacres, no Sicilian Vespers, no Inquisition, no\ncondemnation to the galleys for having taken water from the sea\nwithout paying for it; unless we suppose this republic to be\ncomposed of devils in a corner of hell.''\n\nAll these men who are supposed to have inspired the Revolution\nhad opinions which were far from subversive, and it is really\ndifficult to see that they had any real influence on the\ndevelopment of the revolutionary movement.  Rousseau was one of\nthe very few democratic philosophers of his age, which is why his\nContrat Social became the Bible of the men of the Terror.  It\nseemed to furnish the rational justification necessary to excuse\nthe acts deriving from unconscious mystic and affective impulses\nwhich no philosophy had inspired.\n\nTo be quite truthful, the democratic instincts of Rousseau were\nby no means above suspicion.  He himself considered that his\nprojects for social reorganisation, based upon popular\nsovereignty, could be applied only to a very small State; and\nwhen the Poles asked him for a draft democratic Constitution he\nadvised them to choose a hereditary monarch.\n\nAmong the theories of Rousseau that relating to the perfection of\nthe primitive social state had a great success.  He asserted,\ntogether with various writers of his time, that primitive mankind\nwas perfect; it was corrupted only by society.  By modifying\nsociety by means of good laws one might bring back the\nhappiness of the early world.  Ignorant of all psychology, he\nbelieved that men were the same throughout time and space and\nthat they could all be ruled by the same laws and institutions.\nThis was then the general belief.  ``The vices and virtues of the\npeople,'' wrote Helvetius, ``are always a necessary effect of its\nlegislation. . . .  How can we doubt that virtue is in the case\nof all peoples the result of the wisdom, more or less perfect, of\nthe administration?''\n\nThere could be no greater mistake.\n\n\n3.  The Philosophical Ideas of the Bourgeoisie at the Time of\nthe Revolution.\n\n\nIt is by no means easy to say just what were the social and\npolitical conceptions of a Frenchman of the middle classes at the\nmoment of the Revolution.  They might be reduced to a few\nformulae concerning fraternity, equality, and popular\ngovernment, summed up in the celebrated Declaration of the Rights\nof Man, of which we shall have occasion to quote a few passages.\n\nThe philosophers of the eighteenth century do not seem to have\nbeen very highly rated by the men of the Revolution.  Rarely are\nthey quoted in the speeches of the time.  Hypnotised by their\nclassical memories of Greece and Rome, the new legislators re-\nread their Plato and their Plutarch.  They wished to revive the\nconstitution of Sparta, with its manners, its frugal habits, and\nits laws.\n\nLycurgus, Solon, Miltiades, Manlius Torquatus, Brutus, Mucius\nScaevola, even the fabulous Minos himself, became as familiar\nin the tribune as in the theatre, and the public went crazy over\nthem.  The shades of the heroes of antiquity hovered over\nthe revolutionary assemblies.  Posterity alone has replaced them\nby the shades of the philosophers of the eighteenth century.\n\nWe shall see that in reality the men of this period, generally\nrepresented as bold innovators guided by subtle philosophers,\nprofessed to effect no innovations whatever, but to return to a\npast long buried in the mists of history, and which, moreover,\nthey scarcely ever in the least understood.\n\nThe more reasonable, who did not go so far back for their models,\naimed merely at adopting the English constitutional system, of\nwhich Montesquieu and Voltaire had sung the praises, and which\nall nations were finally to imitate without violent crises.\n\nTheir ambitions were confined to a desire to perfect the existing\nmonarchy, not to overthrow it.  But in time of revolution men\noften take a very different path from that they propose to take.\nAt the time of the convocation of the States General no one would\never have supposed that a revolution of peaceful bourgeoisie\nand men of letters would rapidly be transformed into one of the\nmost sanguinary dictatorships of history.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nPSYCHOLOGICAL ILLUSIONS RESPECTING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\n\n1. Illusions respecting Primitive Man, the Return to a State of\nNature, and the Psychology of the People.\n\nWe have already repeated, and shall again repeat, that the errors\nof a doctrine do not hinder its propagation, so that all we have\nto consider here is its influence upon men's minds.\n\nBut although the criticism of erroneous doctrines is seldom of\npractical utility, it is extremely interesting from a\npsychological point of view.  The philosopher who wishes to\nunderstand the working of men's minds should always carefully\nconsider the illusions which they live with.  Never, perhaps, in\nthe course of history have these illusions appeared so profound\nand so numerous as during the Revolution.\n\nOne of the most prominent was the singular conception of the\nnature of our first ancestors and primitive societies.\nAnthropology not having as yet revealed the conditions of our\nremoter forbears, men supposed, being influenced by the legends\nof the Bible, that man had issued perfect from the hands of the\nCreator.  The first societies were models which were afterwards\nruined by civilisation, but to which mankind must return.\nThe return to the state of nature was very soon the general cry.\n``The fundamental principle of all morality, of which I have\ntreated in my writings,'' said Rousseau, ``is that man is a being\nnaturally good, loving justice and order.''\n\nModern science, by determining, from the surviving remnants, the\nconditions of life of our first ancestors, has long ago shown the\nerror of this doctrine.  Primitive man has become an ignorant and\nferocious brute, as ignorant as the modern savage of goodness,\nmorality, and pity.  Governed only by his instinctive impulses,\nhe throws himself on his prey when hunger drives him from his\ncave, and falls upon his enemy the moment he is aroused by\nhatred.  Reason, not being born, could have no hold over his\ninstincts.\n\nThe aim of civilisation, contrary to all revolutionary beliefs,\nhas been not to return to the state of nature but to escape from\nit.  It was precisely because the Jacobins led mankind back to\nthe primitive condition by destroying all the social restraints\nwithout which no civilisation can exist that they transformed a\npolitical society into a barbarian horde.\n\nThe ideas of these theorists concerning the nature of man were\nabout as valuable as those of a Roman general concerning the\npower of omens.  Yet their influence as motives of action was\nconsiderable.  The Convention was always inspired by such ideas.\n\nThe errors concerning our primitive ancestors were excusable\nenough, since before modern discoveries had shown us the real\nconditions of their existence these were absolutely unknown.  But\nthe absolute ignorance of human psychology displayed by the men\nof the Revolution is far less easy to understand.\n\nIt would really seem as though the philosophers and writers of\nthe eighteenth century must have been totally deficient in the\nsmallest faculty of observation.  They lived amidst their\ncontemporaries without seeing them and without understanding\nthem.  Above all, they had not a suspicion of the true nature of\nthe popular mind.  The man of the people always appeared to them\nin the likeness of the chimerical model created by their dreams.\nAs ignorant of psychology as of the teachings of history, they\nconsidered the plebeian man as naturally good, affectionate,\ngrateful, and always ready to listen to reason.\n\nThe speeches delivered by members of the Assembly show how\nprofound were these illusions.  When the peasants began to burn\nthe chateaux they were greatly astonished, and addressed\nthem in sentimental harangues, praying them to cease, in order\nnot to ``give pain to their good king,'' and adjured them ``to\nsurprise him by their virtues.''\n\n\n2.  Illusions respecting the Possibility of separating Man from\nhis Past and the Power of Transformation attributed to the Law.\n\n\nOne of the principles which served as a foundation for the\nrevolutionary institutions was that man may readily be cut off\nfrom his past, and that a society may be re-made in all its parts\nby means of institutions.  Persuaded in the light of reason that,\nexcept for the primitive ages which were to serve as models, the\npast represented an inheritance of errors and superstitions, the\nlegislators of the day resolved to break entirely with that past.\n\nThe better to emphasise their intention, they founded a\nnew era, transformed the calendar, and changed the names of the\nmonths and seasons.\n\nSupposing all men to be alike, they thought they could legislate\nfor the human race.  Condorcet imagined that he was expressing an\nevident truth when he said:  ``A good law must be good for all\nmen, just as a geometrical proposition is true for all.''\n\nThe theorists of the Revolution never perceived, behind the world\nof visible things, the secret springs which moved them.  A\ncentury of biological progress was needed to show how grievous\nwere their mistakes, and how wholly a being of whatever species\ndepends on its past.\n\nWith the influence of the past, the reformers of the Revolution\nwere always clashing, without ever understanding it.  They wanted\nto annihilate it, but were annihilated by it instead.\n\nThe faith of law-makers in the absolute power of laws and\ninstitutions, rudely shaken by the end of the Revolution, was\nabsolute at its outbreak.  Gregoire said from the tribune of\nthe Constituent Assembly, without provoking the least\nastonishment:  ``We could if we would change religion, but we do\nnot want to.''  We know that they did want to later, and we know\nhow miserably their attempt failed.\n\nYet the Jacobins had in their hands all the elements of success.\nThanks to the completest of tyrannies, all obstacles were\nremoved, and the laws which it pleased them to impose were always\naccepted.  After ten years of violence, of destruction and\nburning and pillage and massacre and general upheaval,\ntheir impotence was revealed so startlingly that they fell into\nuniversal reprobation.  The dictator then invoked by the whole of\nFrance was obliged to re-establish the greater part of that which\nhad been destroyed.\n\nThe attempt of the Jacobins to re-fashion society in the name of\npure reason constitutes an experiment of the highest interest.\nProbably mankind will never have occasion to repeat it on so vast\na scale.\n\nAlthough the lesson was a terrible one, it does not seem to have\nbeen sufficient for a considerable class of minds, since even in\nour days we hear Socialists propose to rebuild society from top\nto bottom according to their chimerical plans.\n\n\n3.  Illusions respecting the Theoretical Value of the great\nRevolutionary Principles.\n\nThe fundamental principles on which the Revolution was based in\norder to create a new dispensation are contained in the\nDeclarations of Rights which were formulated successively in\n1789, 1793, and 1795.  All three Declarations agree in\nproclaiming that ``the principle of sovereignty resides in the\nnation.''\n\nFor the rest, the three Declarations differ on several points,\nnotably in the matter of equality.  That of 1789 simply states\n(Article 1):  ``Men are born and remain free and having equal\nrights.''  That of 1793 goes farther, and assures us (Article 3):\n\n``All men are equal by nature.''  That of 1795 is more modest and\nsays (Article 3):  ``Equality consists in the law being the same\nfor all.''  Besides this, having mentioned rights, the third\nDeclaration considers it useful to speak of duties.  Its\nmorality is simply that of the Gospel.  Article 2 says:  ``All\nthe duties of a man and a citizen derive from these two\nprinciples engraved on all hearts by nature: do not do unto\nothers that which you would not they should do unto you; do\nconstantly unto others the good you would wish to receive from\nthem.''\n\nThe essential portions of these proclamations, the only portions\nwhich have really survived, were those relating to equality and\npopular sovereignty.\n\nDespite the weakness of its rational meaning, the part played by\nthe Republican device, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, was\nconsiderable.\n\nThis magic formula, which is still left engraven on many of our\nwalls until it shall be engraven on our hearts, has really\npossessed the supernatural power attributed to certain words by\nthe old sorcerers.\n\nThanks to the new hopes excited by its promises, its power of\nexpansion was considerable.  Thousands of men lost their lives\nfor it.  Even in our days, when a revolution breaks out in any\npart of the world, the same formula is always invoked.\n\nIts choice was happy in the extreme.  It belongs to the category\nof indefinite dream-evoking sentences, which every one is free to\ninterpret according to his own desires, hatreds, and hopes.  In\nmatters of faith the real sense of words matters very little; it\nis the meaning attached to them that makes their importance.\n\nOf the three principles of the revolutionary device, equality was\nmost fruitful of consequences.  We shall see in another part of\nthis book that it is almost the only one which still\nsurvives, and is still productive of effects.\n\nIt was certainly not the Revolution that introduced the idea of\nequality into the world.  Without going back even to the Greek\nrepublics, we may remark that the theory of equality was taught\nin the clearest fashion by Christianity and Islamism.  All men,\nsubjects of the one God, were equal before Him, and judged solely\naccording to their merits.  The dogma of the equality of souls\nbefore God was an essential dogma with Mohammedans as well as\nwith Christians.\n\nBut to proclaim a principle is not enough to secure its\nobservation.  The Christian Church soon renounced its theoretical\nequality, and the men of the Revolution only remembered it in\ntheir speeches.\n\nThe sense of the term ``equality'' varies according to the\npersons using it.  It often conceals sentiments very contrary to\nits real sense, and then represents the imperious need of having\nno one above one, joined to the no less lively desire to feel\nabove others.  With the Jacobins of the Revolution, as with those\nof our days, the word ``equality'' simply involves a jealous\nhatred of all superiority.  To efface superiority, such men\npretend to unify manners, customs, and situations.  All\ndespotisms but that exercised by themselves seem odious.\n\nNot being able to avoid the natural inequalities, they deny them.\n\nThe second Declaration of Rights, that of 1793, affirms, contrary\nto the evidence, that ``all men are equal by nature.''\n\nIt would seem that in many of the men of the Revolution\nthe ardent desire for equality merely concealed an intense need\nof inequalities.  Napoleon was obliged to re-establish titles of\nnobility and decorations for their benefit.  Having shown that it\nwas among the most rabid revolutionists that he found the most\ndocile instruments of domination, Taine continues:--\n\n``Suddenly, through all their preaching of liberty and equality,\nappeared their authoritative instincts, their need of commanding,\neven as subordinates, and also, in most cases, an appetite for\nmoney or for pleasure.  Between the delegate of the Committee of\nPublic Safety and the minister, prefect, or subprefect of the\nEmpire the difference is small: it is the same man under the two\ncostumes, first en carmagnole, then in the braided coat.''\n\nThe dogma of equality had as its first consequence the\nproclamation of popular sovereignty by the bourgeoisie.  This\nsovereignty remained otherwise highly theoretical during the\nwhole Revolution.\n\nThe principle of authority was the lasting legacy of the\nRevolution.  The two terms ``liberty'' and ``fraternity'' which\naccompany it in the republican device had never much influence.\nWe may even say that they had none during the Revolution and the\nEmpire, but merely served to decorate men's speeches.\n\nTheir influence was hardly more considerable later.  Fraternity\nwas never practised and the peoples have never cared much for\nliberty.  To-day our working-men have completely surrendered it\nto their unions.\n\nTo sum up: although the Republican motto has been little\napplied it has exerted a very great influence.  Of the French\nRevolution practically nothing has remained in the popular mind\nbut the three celebrated words which sum up its gospel, and which\nits armies spread over Europe.\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\nTHE RATIONAL, AFFECTIVE, MYSTIC, AND COLLECTIVE INFLUENCES ACTIVE\nDURING THE REVOLUTION\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY\n\n1.  Psychological Influences active during the French Revolution.\n\nThe genesis of the French Revolution, as well as its duration,\nwas conditioned by elements of a rational, affective, mystic, and\ncollective nature, each category of which was ruled by a\ndifferent logic.  It is, as I have said, because they have not\nbeen able to dissociate the respective influences of these\nfactors that so many historians have interpreted this period so\nindifferently\n\nThe rational element usually invoked as an explanation exerted in\nreality but a very slight influence.  It prepared the way for the\nRevolution, but maintained it only at the outset, while it was\nstill exclusively middle-class.  Its action was manifested by\nmany measures of the time, such as the proposals to reform the\ntaxes, the suppression of the privileges of a useless nobility,\n&c.\n\nAs soon as the Revolution reached the people, the influence of\nthe rational elements speedily vanished before that of the\naffective and collective elements.  As for the mystic elements,\nthe foundation of the revolutionary faith, they made the army\nfanatical and propagated the new belief throughout the world.\n\nWe shall see these various elements as they appeared in events\nand in the psychology of individuals.  Perhaps the most important\nwas the mystic element.  The Revolution cannot be clearly\ncomprehended--we cannot repeat it too often--unless it is\nconsidered as the formation of a religious belief.  What I have\nsaid elsewhere of all beliefs applies equally to the Revolution.\nReferring, for instance, to the chapter on the Reformation, the\nreader will see that it presents more than one analogy with the\nRevolution.\n\nHaving wasted so much time in demonstrating the slight rational\nvalue of beliefs, the philosophers are to-day beginning to\nunderstand their function better.  They have been forced to admit\nthat these are the only factors which possess an influence\nsufficient to transform all the elements of a civilisation.\n\nThey impose themselves on men apart from reason and have the\npower to polarise men's thoughts and feelings in one direction.\nPure reason had never such a power, for men were never\nimpassioned by reason.\n\nThe religious form rapidly assumed by the Revolution explains its\npower of expansion and the prestige which it possessed and has\nretained.\n\nFew historians have understood that this great monument ought to\nbe regarded as the foundation of a new religion.  The penetrating\nmind of Tocqueville, I believe, was the first to perceive as\nmuch.\n\n``The French Revolution,'' he wrote, ``was a political revolution\nwhich operated in the manner of and assumed something of the\naspect of a religious revolution.  See by what regular and\ncharacteristic traits it finally resembled the latter: not only\ndid it spread itself far and wide like a religious revolution,\nbut, like the latter, it spread itself by means of preaching and\npropaganda.  A political revolution which inspires proselytes,\nwhich is preached as passionately to foreigners as it is\naccomplished at home: consider what a novel spectacle was this.''\n\nThe religious side of the Revolution being granted, the\naccompanying fury and devastation are easily explained.  History\nshows us that such are always the accompaniments of the birth of\nreligions.  The Revolution was therefore certain to provoke the\nviolence and intolerance the triumphant deities demand from their\nadepts.  It overturned all Europe for twenty years, ruined\nFrance, caused the death of millions of men, and cost the country\nseveral invasions: but it is as a rule only at the cost of such\ncatastrophes that a people can change its beliefs.\n\nAlthough the mystic element is always the foundation of beliefs,\ncertain affective and rational elements are quickly added\nthereto.  A belief thus serves to group sentiments and passions\nand interests which belong to the affective domain.  Reason then\nenvelops the whole, seeking to justify events in which, however,\nit played no part whatever.\n\nAt the moment of the Revolution every one, according to his\naspirations, dressed the new belief in a different rational\nvesture.  The peoples saw in it only the suppression of the\nreligious and political despotisms and hierarchies under\nwhich they had so often suffered.  Writers like Goethe and\nthinkers like Kant imagined that they saw in it the triumph of\nreason.  Foreigners like Humboldt came to France ``to breathe the\nair of liberty and to assist at the obsequies of despotism.''\n\nThese intellectual illusions did not last long.  The evolution of\nthe drama soon revealed the true foundations of the dream.\n\n\n2.  Dissolution of the Ancien Regime.  The assembling of the\nStates General.\n\n\nBefore they are realised in action, revolutions are sketched out\nin men's thoughts.  Prepared by the causes already studied, the\nFrench Revolution commenced in reality with the reign of Louis\nXVI.  More discontented and censorious every day, the middle\nclasses added claim to claim.  Everybody was calling for reform.\n\nLouis XVI. thoroughly understood the utility of reform, but he\nwas too weak to impose it on the clergy and the nobility.  He\ncould not even retain his reforming ministers, Malesherbes and\nTurgot.  What with famines and increased taxation, the poverty of\nall classes increased, and the huge pensions drawn by the Court\nformed a shocking contrast to the general distress.\n\nThe notables convoked to attempt to remedy the financial\nsituation refused a system of equal taxation, and granted only\ninsignificant reforms which the Parliament did not even consent\nto register.  It had to be dissolved.  The provincial Parliaments\nmade common cause with that of Paris, and were also dissolved.\nBut they led opinion, and in all parts of France promoted\nthe demand for a meeting of the States General, which had not\nbeen convoked for nearly two hundred years.\n\nThe decision was taken:  5,000,000 Frenchmen, of whom 100,000\nwere ecclesiastics and 150,000 nobles, sent their\nrepresentatives.  There were in all 1,200 deputies, of whom 578\nwere of the Third Estate, consisting chiefly of magistrates,\nadvocates, and physicians.  Of the 300 deputies of the clergy,\n200, of plebeian origin, threw in their lot with the Third Estate\nagainst the nobility and clergy.\n\nFrom the first sessions a psychological conflict broke out\nbetween the deputies of different social conditions and\n(therefore) different mentalities.  The magnificent costumes of\nthe privileged deputies contrasted in a humiliating fashion with\nthe sombre fashions of the Third Estate.\n\nAt the first session the members of the nobility and the clergy\n were covered, according to the prerogatives of their class,\nbefore the king.  Those of the Third Estate wished to imitate\nthem, but the privileged members protested.  On the following day\nmore protests of wounded self-love were heard.  The deputies of\nthe Third Estate invited those of the nobility and the clergy who\nwere sitting in separate halls to join them for the verification\nof their powers.  The nobles refused.  The negotiations lasted\nmore than a month.  Finally, the deputies of the Third Estate, on\nthe proposition of the Abbe Sieyes, considering that\nthey represented 95 per cent. of the nation, declared themselves\nconstituted as a National Assembly.  From that moment the\nRevolution pursued its course.\n\n\n3.  The Constituent Assembly.\n\n\nThe power of a political assembly resides, above all, in the\nweakness of its adversaries.  Astonished by the slight resistance\nencountered, and carried away by the ascendancy of a handful of\norators, the Constituent Assembly, from its earliest sessions,\nspoke and acted as a sovereign body.  Notably it arrogated to\nitself the power of decreeing imposts, a serious encroachment\nupon the prerogatives of the royal power.\n\nThe resistance of Louis XVI. was feeble enough.  He simply had\nthe hall in which the States assembled closed.  The deputies then\nmet in the hall of the tennis-court, and took the oath that they\nwould not separate until the Constitution of the kingdom was an\nestablished fact.\n\nThe majority of the deputies of the clergy went with them.  The\nking revoked the decision of the Assembly, and ordered the\ndeputies to retire.  The Marquis de Dreux-Breze, the Grand\nMaster of Ceremonies, having invited them to obey the order of\nthe sovereign, the President of the Assembly declared ``that the\nnation assembled cannot receive orders,'' and Mirabeau replied to\nthe envoy of the sovereign that, being united by the will of the\npeople, the Assembly would only withdraw at the point of the\nbayonet.  Again the king gave way.\n\nOn the 9th of June the meeting of deputies took the title of the\nConstituent Assembly.  For the first time in centuries the king\nwas forced to recognise the existence of a new power, formerly\nignored--that of the people, represented by its elected\nrepresentatives.  The absolute monarchy was no more.\n\nFeeling himself more and more seriously threatened, Louis XVI.\nsummoned to Versailles a number of regiments composed of foreign\nmercenaries.  The Assembly demanded the withdrawal of the troops.\n\nThe king refused, and dismissed Necker, replacing him by the\nMarshal de Broglie, reputed to be an extremely authoritative\nperson.\n\nBut the Assembly had able supporters.  Camille Desmoulins and\nothers harangued the crowd in all directions, calling it to the\ndefence of liberty.  They sounded the tocsin, organised a militia\nof 12,000 men, took muskets and cannon from the Invalides, and on\nthe 14th of July the armed bands marched upon the Bastille.  The\nfortress, barely defended, capitulated in a few hours.  Seven\nprisoners were found within it, of whom one was an idiot and four\nwere accused of forgery.\n\nThe Bastille, the prison of many victims of arbitrary power,\nsymbolised the royal power to many minds; but the people who\ndemolished it had not suffered by it.  Scarcely any but members\nof the nobility were imprisoned there.\n\nThe influence exercised by the taking of this fortress has\ncontinued to our days.  Serious historians like M. Rambaud assure\nus that ``the taking of the Bastille is a culminating fact in the\nhistory, not of France only but of all Europe, and inaugurates a\nnew epoch in the history of the world.''\n\nSuch credulity is a little excessive.  The importance of the\nevent lay simply in the psychological fact that for the first\ntime the people received an obvious proof of the weakness of an\nauthority which had lately been formidable.\n\nWhen the principle of authority is injured in the public mind it\ndissolves very rapidly.  What might not one demand of a king who\ncould not defend his principal fortress against popular attacks?\nThe master regarded as all-powerful had ceased to be so.\n\nThe taking of the Bastille was the beginning of one of those\nphenomena of mental contagion which abound in the history of the\nRevolution.  The foreign mercenary troops, although they could\nscarcely be interested in the movement, began to show symptoms of\nmutiny.  Louis XVI. was reduced to accepting their disbandment.\nHe recalled Necker, went to the Hotel de Ville, sanctioned by\nhis presence the accomplished facts, and accepted from La\nFayette, commandant of the National Guard, the new cockade of\nred, white, and blue which allied the colours of Paris to those\nof the king.\n\nAlthough the riot which ended in the taking of the Bastille can\nby no means be regarded as ``a culminating fact in history,'' it\ndoes mark the precise moment of the commencement of popular\ngovernment.  The armed people thenceforth intervened daily in the\ndeliberations of the revolutionary Assemblies, and seriously\ninfluenced their conduct.\n\nThis intervention of the people in conformity with the dogma of\nits sovereignty has provoked the respectful admiration of many\nhistorians of the Revolution.  Even a superficial study of the\npsychology of crowds would speedily have shown them that the\nmystic entity which they call the people was merely translating\nthe will of a few leaders.  It is not correct to say that the\npeople took the Bastille, attacked the Tuileries, invaded the\nConvention, &c., but that certain leaders--generally by\nmeans of the clubs--united armed bands of the populace, which\nthey led against the Bastille, the Tuileries, &c.  During the\nRevolution the same crowds attacked or defended the most contrary\nparties, according to the leaders who happened to be at their\nheads.  A crowd never has any opinion but that of its leaders.\n\nExample constituting one of the most potent forms of suggestion,\nthe taking of the Bastille was inevitably followed by the\ndestruction of other fortresses.  Many chateaux were regarded as\nso many little Bastilles, and in order to imitate the Parisians\nwho had destroyed theirs the peasants began to burn them.  They\ndid so with the greater fury because the seigneurial homes\ncontained the titles of feudal dues.  It was a species of\nJacquerie.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly, so proud and haughty towards the king,\nwas, like all the revolutionary assemblies which followed it,\nextremely pusillanimous before the people.\n\nHoping to put an end to the disorders of the night of August 4th,\nit voted, on the proposition of a member of the nobility, the\nComte de Noailles, the abolition of seigneurial rights.  Although\nthis measure suppressed at one stroke the privileges of the\nnobles, it was voted with tears and embracings.  Such accesses of\nsentimental enthusiasm are readily explained when we recall how\ncontagious emotion is in a crowd, above all in an assembly\noppressed by fear.\n\nIf the renunciation of their rights had been effected by the\nnobility a few years earlier, the Revolution would doubtless have\nbeen avoided, but it was now too late.  To give way only when one\nis forced to do so merely increases the demands of those\nto whom one yields.  In politics one should always look ahead and\ngive way long before one is forced to do so.\n\nLouis XVI. hesitated for two months to ratify the decisions voted\nby the Assembly on the night of the 4th of August.  He had\nretired to Versailles.  The leaders sent thither a band of 7,000\nor 8,000 men and women of the people, assuring them that the\nroyal residence contained great stores of bread.  The railings of\nthe palace were forced, some of the bodyguard were killed, and\nthe king and all his family were led back to Paris in the midst\nof a shrieking crowd, many of whom bore on the ends of their\npikes the heads of the soldiers massacred.  The dreadful journey\nlasted six hours.  These events constituted what are known as the\n``days'' of October.\n\nThe popular power increased, and in reality the king, like the\nwhole assembly, was henceforth in the hands of the people--that\nis, at the mercy of the clubs and their leaders.  This popular\npower was to prevail for nearly ten years, and the Revolution was\nto be almost entirely its work.\n\nWhile proclaiming that the people constituted the only sovereign,\nthe Assembly was greatly embarrassed by riots which went far\nbeyond its theoretical expectations.  It had supposed that order\nwould be restored while it fabricated a Constitution destined to\nassure the eternal happiness of mankind.\n\nWe know that during the whole duration of the Revolution one of\nthe chief occupations of the assemblies was to make, unmake, and\nremake Constitutions.  The theorists attributed to them then, as\nthey do to-day, the power of transforming society; the\nAssembly, therefore, could not neglect its task.  In the meantime\nit published a solemn Declaration of the Rights of Man which\nsummarised its principles.\n\nThe Constitution, proclamations, declarations, and speeches had\nnot the slightest effect on the popular movements, nor on the\ndissentients who daily increased in number in the heart of the\nAssembly.  The latter became more and more subjected to the\nascendancy of the advanced party, which was supported by the\nclubs.  Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and later Marat and\nHebert, violently excited the populace by their harangues and\ntheir journals.  The Assembly was rapidly going down the slope\nthat leads to extremes.\n\nDuring all these disorders the finances of the country were not\nimproving.  Finally convinced that philanthropic speeches would\nnot alter their lamentable condition, and seeing that bankruptcy\nthreatened, the Assembly decreed, on the 2nd of November, 1789,\nthe confiscation of the goods of the Church.  Their revenues,\nconsisting of the tithes collected from the faithful, amounted to\nsome L8,000,000, and their value was estimated at about\nL120,000,000.  They were divided among some hundreds of\nprelates, Court abbes, &c., who owned a quarter of all France.\nThese goods, henceforth entitled is ``national domains,'' formed\nthe guarantee of the assignats, the first issue of which was\nfor 400,000,000 francs (L16,000,000 sterling).  The public\naccepted them at the outset, but they multiplied so under the\nDirectory and the Convention, which issued 45,000,000,000 francs\nin this form (L1,800,000,000 sterling), that an assignat of\n100 livres was finally worth only a few halfpence.\n\nStimulated by his advisers, the feeble Louis attempted in\nvain to struggle against the decrees of the Assembly by refusing\nto sanction them.\n\nUnder the influence of the daily suggestions of the leaders and\nthe power of mental contagion the revolutionary movement was\nspreading everywhere independently of the Assembly and often even\nagainst it.\n\nIn the towns and villages revolutionary municipalities were\ninstituted, protected by the local National Guards.  Those of\nneighbouring towns commenced to make mutual arrangements to\ndefend themselves should need arise.  Thus federations were\nformed, which were soon rolled into one; this sent 14,000\nNational Guards to Paris, who assembled on the Champ-de-Mars on\nthe 14th of July, 1790.  There the king swore to maintain the\nConstitution decreed by the National Assembly.\n\nDespite this vain oath it became more evident every day that no\nagreement was possible between the hereditary principles of the\nmonarchy and those proclaimed by the Assembly.\n\nFeeling himself completely powerless, the king thought only of\nflight.  Arrested at Varennes and brought back a prisoner to\nParis, he was shut up in the Tuileries.  The Assembly, although\nstill extremely royalist, suspended him from power, and decided\nto assume the sole charge of the government.\n\nNever did sovereign find himself in a position so difficult as\nthat of Louis at the time of his flight.  The genius of a\nRichelieu would hardly have extricated him.  The only element of\ndefence on which he could have relied had from the beginning\nabsolutely failed him.\n\nDuring the whole duration of the Constituent Assembly the\nimmense majority of Frenchmen and of the Assembly remained\nroyalist, so that had the sovereign accepted a liberal monarchy\nhe could perhaps have remained in power.  It would seem that\nLouis had little to promise in order to come to an agreement with\nthe Assembly.\n\nLittle, perhaps, but with his structure of mind that little was\nstrictly impossible.  All the shades of his forbears would have\nrisen up in front of him had he consented to modify the mechanism\nof the monarchy inherited from so many ancestors.  And even had\nhe attempted to do so, the opposition of his family, the clergy,\nthe nobles, and the Court could never have been surmounted.  The\nancient castes on which the monarchy rested, the nobility and the\nclergy, were then almost as powerful as the monarch himself.\nEvery time it seemed as though he might yield to the injunctions\nof the Assembly it was because he was constrained to do so by\nforce, and to attempt to gain time.  His appeals to alien Powers\nrepresented the resolution of a desperate man who had seen all\nhis natural defences fail him.\n\nHe, and especially the queen, entertained the strangest illusions\nas to the possible assistance of Austria, for centuries the rival\nof France.  If Austria indolently consented to come to his aid,\nit was only in the hope of receiving a great reward.  Mercy gave\nhim to understand that the payment expected consisted of Alsace,\nthe Alps, and Navarre.\n\nThe leaders of the clubs, finding the Assembly too royalist, sent\nthe people against it.  A petition was signed, inviting the\nAssembly to convoke a new constituent power to proceed to the\ntrial of Louis XVI.\n\nMonarchical in spite of all, and finding that the Revolution was\nassuming a character far too demagogic, the Assembly resolved to\ndefend itself against the actions of the people.  A battalion of\nthe National Guard, commanded by La Fayette, was sent to the\nChamp-de-Mars, where the crowd was assembled, to disperse it.\nFifty of those present were killed.\n\nThe Assembly did not long persist in its feeble resistance.\nExtremely fearful of the people, it increased its arrogance\ntowards the king, depriving him every day of some part of his\nprerogatives and authority.  He was now scarcely more than a mere\nofficial obliged to execute the wishes of others.\n\nThe Assembly had imagined that it would be able to exercise the\nauthority of which it had deprived the king, but such a task was\ninfinitely above its resources.  A power so divided is always\nweak.  ``I know nothing more terrible,'' said Mirabeau, ``than\nthe sovereign authority of six hundred persons.''\n\nHaving flattered itself that it could combine in itself all the\npowers of the State, and exercise them as Louis XVI. had done,\nthe Assembly very soon exercised none whatever.\n\nAs its authority failed anarchy increased.  The popular leaders\ncontinually stirred up the people.  Riot and insurrection became\nthe sole power.  Every day the Assembly was invaded by rowdy and\nimperious delegations which operated by means of threats and\ndemands.\n\nAll these popular movements, which the Assembly, under the stress\nof fear, invariably obeyed, had nothing spontaneous about them.\nThey simply represented the manifestations of new powers--the\nclubs and the Commune--which had been set up beside the\nAssembly.\n\nThe most powerful of these clubs was the Jacobin, which had\nquickly created more than five hundred branches in the country,\nall of which were under the orders of the central body.  Its\ninfluence remained preponderant during the whole duration of the\nRevolution.  It was the master of the Assembly, and then of\nFrance, its only rival the insurrectionary Commune, whose power\nwas exercised only in Paris.\n\nThe weakness of the national Assembly and all its failures had\nmade it extremely unpopular.  It became conscious of this, and,\nfeeling that it was every day more powerless, decided to hasten\nthe creation of the new Constitution in order that it might\ndissolve.  Its last action, which was tactless enough, was to\ndecree that no member of the Constituent Assembly should be\nelected to the Legislative Assembly.  The members of the latter\nwere thus deprived of the experience acquired by their\npredecessors.\n\nThe Constitution was completed on the 3rd of September, 1791, and\naccepted on the 13th by the king, to whom the Assembly had\nrestored his powers.\n\nThis Constitution organised a representative Government,\ndelegating the legislative power to deputies elected by the\npeople, and the executive power to the king, whose right of veto\nover the decrees of the Assembly was recognised.  New\ndepartmental divisions were substituted for the old provinces.\nThe imposts were abolished, and replaced by direct and indirect\ntaxes, which are still in force.\n\nThe Assembly, which had just altered the territorial divisions\nand overthrown all the old social organisation, thought\nitself powerful enough to transform the religious organisation of\nthe country also.  It claimed notably that the members of the\nclergy should be elected by the people, and should be thus\nwithdrawn from the influence of their supreme head, the Pope.\n\nThis civil constitution of the clergy was the origin of religious\nstruggles and persecutions which lasted until the days of the\nConsulate.  Two-thirds of the priests refused the oath demanded\nof them.\n\nDuring the three years which represented the life of the\nConstituent Assembly the Revolution had produced considerable\nresults.  The principal result was perhaps the beginning of the\ntransference to the Third Estate of the riches of the privileged\nclasses.  In this way while interests were created to be defended\nfervent adherents were raised up to the new regime.  A\nRevolution supported by the gratification of acquired appetites\nis bound to be powerful.  The Third Estate, which had supplanted\nthe nobles, and the peasants, who had bought the national\ndomains, would readily understand that the restoration of the\nancien regime would despoil them of all their advantages.\nThe energetic defence of the Revolution was merely the defence of\ntheir own fortunes.\n\nThis is why we see, during part of the Revolution, nearly half\nthe departments vainly rising against the despotism that crushed\nthem.  The Republicans triumphed over all opposition.  They were\nextremely powerful in that they had to defend, not only a new\nideal, but new material interests.  We shall see that the\ninfluence of these two factors lasted during the whole of the\nRevolution, and contributed powerfully to the establishment of\nthe Empire.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY\n\n1.  Political Events during the Life of the Legislative Assembly.\n\nBefore examining the mental characteristics of the Legislative\nAssembly let us briefly sum up the considerable political events\nwhich marked its short year's life.  They naturally played an\nimportant part in respect of its psychological manifestations.\n\nExtremely monarchical, the Legislative Assembly had no more idea\nthan its predecessor of destroying the monarchy.  The king\nappeared to it to be slightly suspect, but it still hoped to be\nable to retain him on the throne.\n\nUnhappily for him, Louis was incessantly begging for intervention\nfrom abroad.  Shut up in the Tuileries, defended only by his\nSwiss Guards, the timid sovereign was drifting among contrary\ninfluences.  He subsidised journals intended to modify public\nopinion, but the obscure ``penny-a-liners'' who edited them knew\nnothing of acting on the mind of the crowd.  Their only means of\npersuasion was to menace with the gallows all the partisans of\nthe Revolution, and to predict the invasion of France by an army\nwhich would rescue the king.\n\nRoyalty no longer counted on anything but the foreign\nCourts.  The nobles were emigrating.  Prussia, Austria, and\nRussia were threatening France with a war of invasion.  The Court\nfavoured their lead.  To the coalition of the three kings against\nFrance the Jacobin Club proposed to oppose a league of peoples.\nThe Girondists were then, with the Jacobins, at the head of the\nrevolutionary movement.  They incited the masses to arm\nthemselves--600,000 volunteers were equipped.  The Court accepted\na Girondist minister.  Dominated by him, Louis XVI. was obliged\nto propose to the Assembly a war against Austria.  It was\nimmediately agreed to.\n\nIn declaring war the king was not sincere.  The queen revealed\nthe French plans of campaign and the secret deliberations of the\nCouncil to the Austrians.\n\nThe beginnings of the struggle were disastrous.  Several columns\nof troops, attacked by panic, disbanded.  Stimulated by the\nclubs, and persuaded--justly, for that matter--that the king was\nconspiring with the enemies of France, the population of the\nfaubourgs rose in insurrection.  Its leaders, the Jacobins, and\nabove all Danton, sent to the Tuileries on the 20th of June a\npetition threatening the king with revocation.  It then invaded\nthe Tuileries, heaping invectives on the sovereign.\n\nFatality impelled Louis toward his tragic destiny.  While the\nthreats of the Jacobins against royalty had roused many of the\ndepartments to indignation, it was learned that a Prussian army\nhad arrived on the frontiers of Lorraine.\n\nThe hope of the king and queen respecting the help to be obtained\nfrom abroad was highly chimerical.  Marie-Antoinette\nsuffered from an absolute illusion as to the psychology of the\nAustrian and the French peoples.  Seeing France terrorised by a\nfew energumens, she supposed that it would be equally easy to\nterrify the Parisians, and by means of threats to lead them back\nunder the king's authority.  Inspired by her, Fersen undertook to\npublish the manifesto of the Duke of Brunswick, threatening Paris\nwith ``total subversion if the royal family were molested.''\n\nThe effect produced was diametrically opposite to that intended.\nThe manifesto aroused indignation against the monarch, who was\nregarded as an accomplice, and increased his unpopularity.  From\nthat day he was marked for the scaffold.\n\nCarried away by Danton, the delegates of the sections installed\nthemselves at the Hotel de Ville as an insurrectionary\nCommune, which arrested the commandant of the National Guard, who\nwas devoted to the king, sounded the tocsin, equipped the\nNational Guard, and on the 10th of August hurled them, with the\npopulace, against the Tuileries.  The regiments called in by\nLouis disbanded themselves.  Soon none were left to defend him\nbut his Swiss and a few gentlemen.  Nearly all were killed.  Left\nalone, the king took refuge with the Assembly.  The crowds\ndemanded his denouncement.  The Legislative Assembly decreed his\nsuspension and left a future Assembly, the Convention, to decide\nupon his fate.\n\n\n2.  Mental Characteristics of the Legislative Assembly.\n\n\nThe Legislative Assembly, formed of new men, presented quite a\nspecial interest from the psychological point of view.\nFew assemblies have offered in such a degree the characteristics\nof the political collectivity.\n\nIt comprised seven hundred and fifty deputies, divided into pure\nroyalists, constitutional royalists, republicans, Girondists, and\nMontagnards.  Advocates and men of letters formed the majority.\nIt also contained, but in smaller numbers, superior officers,\npriests, and a very few scientists.\n\nThe philosophical conceptions of the members of this Assembly\nseem rudimentary enough.  Many were imbued with Rousseau's idea\nof a return to a state of nature.  But all, like their\npredecessors, were dominated more especially by recollections of\nGreek and Latin antiquity.  Cato, Brutus, Gracchus, Plutarch,\nMarcus Aurelius, and Plato, continually evoked, furnished the\nimages of their speech.  When the orator wished to insult Louis\nXVI. he called him Caligula.\n\nIn hoping to destroy tradition they were revolutionaries, but in\nclaiming to return to a remote past they showed themselves\nextremely reactionary.\n\nFor the rest, all these theories had very little influence on\ntheir conduct.  Reason was continually figuring in their\nspeeches, but never in their actions.  These were always\ndominated by those affective and mystic elements whose potency we\nhave so often demonstrated.\n\nThe psychological characteristics of the Legislative Assembly\nwere those of the Constituent Assembly, but were greatly\naccentuated.  They may be summed up in four words:\nimpressionability, mobility, timidity, and weakness.\n\nThis mobility and impressionability are revealed in the constant\nvariability of their conduct.  One day they exchange noisy\ninvective and blows.  On the following day we see them ``throwing\nthemselves into one another's arms with torrents of tears.''\nThey eagerly applaud an address demanding the punishment of those\nwho have petitioned for the king's dethronement, and the same day\naccord the honours of the session to a delegation which has come\nto demand his downfall.\n\nThe pusillanimity and weakness of the Assembly in the face of\nthreats was extreme.  Although royalist it voted the suspension\nof the king, and on the demand of the Commune delivered him, with\nhis family, to be imprisoned in the Temple,\n\nThanks to its weakness, it was as incapable as the Constituent\nAssembly of exercising any power, and allowed itself to be\ndominated by the Commune and the clubs, which were directed by\nsuch influential leaders as Hebert, Tallien, Rossignol, Marat,\nRobespierre, &c.\n\nUntil Thermidor, 1794, the insurrectionary Commune constituted\nthe chief power in the State, and behaved precisely as if it had\nbeen charged with the government of Paris.\n\nIt was the Commune that demanded the imprisonment of Louis XVI.\nin the tower of the Temple, when the Assembly wished to imprison\nhim in the palace of the Luxembourg.  It was the Commune again\nthat filled the prisons with suspects, and then ordered them to\nbe killed.\n\nWe know with what refinements of cruelty a handful of some 150\nbandits, paid at the rate of 24 livres a day, and directed by a\nfew members of the Commune, exterminated some 1,200 persons in\nfour days.  This crime was known as the massacre of September.\nThe mayor of Paris, Petion, received the band of assassins with\nrespect, and gave them drink.  A few Girondists protested\nsomewhat, but the Jacobins were silent.\n\nThe terrorised Assembly affected at first to ignore the\nmassacres, which were encouraged by several of its more\ninfluential deputies, notably Couthon and Billaud-Varenne.  When\nat last it decided to condemn them it was without attempting to\nprevent their continuation.\n\nConscious of its impotence, the Legislative Assembly dissolved\nitself a fortnight later in order to give way to the Convention.\n\nIts work was obviously disastrous, not in intention but in fact.\nRoyalist, it abandoned the monarchy; humanitarian, it allowed the\nmassacres of September; pacific, it pushed France into a\nformidable war, thus showing that a weak Government always ends\nby bringing ruin upon its country.\n\nThe history of the two previous revolutionary Assemblies proves\nonce more to what point events carry within them their inevitable\nconsequences.  They constitute a train of necessities of which we\ncan sometimes choose the first, but which then evolve without\nconsulting us.  We are free to make a decision, but powerless to\navert its consequences.\n\nThe first measures of the Constituent Assembly were rational and\nvoluntary, but the results which followed were beyond all will or\nreason or foresight.\n\nWhich of the men of 1789 would have ventured to desire or predict\nthe death of Louis XVI., the wars of La Vendee, the Terror, the\npermanent guillotine and the final anarchy, or the ensuing return\nto tradition and order, guided by the iron hand of a soldier?\n\nIn the development of events which ensued from the early actions\nof the revolutionary Assemblies the most striking, perhaps, was\nthe rise and development of the government of the crowd--of mob\nrule.\n\nBehind the facts which we have been considering--the taking of\nthe Bastille, the invasion of Versailles, the massacres of\nSeptember, the attack on the Tuileries, the murder of the Swiss\nGuards, and the downfall and imprisonment of the king--we can\nreadily perceive the laws affecting the psychology of crowds and\ntheir leaders.\n\nWe shall now see that the power of the multitude will\nprogressively increase, overcome all other powers, and finally\nreplace them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE CONVENTION\n\n1.  The Legend of the Convention.\n\nThe history of the Convention is not merely fertile in\npsychological documents.  It also shows how powerless the\nwitnesses of any period and even their immediate successors are\nto form an exact idea of the events which they have witnessed,\nand the men who have surrounded them.\n\nMore than a century has elapsed since the Revolution, and men are\nonly just beginning to form judgments concerning this period\nwhich, if still often doubtful enough, are slightly more accurate\nthan of old.\n\nThis happens, not only because new documents are being drawn from\nthe archives, but because the legends which enveloped that\nsanguinary period in a magical cloud are gradually vanishing with\nthe passage of time.\n\nPerhaps the most tenacious legend of all was that which until\nformerly used to surround the personages to whom our fathers\napplied the glorious epithet, ``the Giants of the Convention.''\n\nThe struggles of the Convention against France in insurrection\nand Europe in arms produced such an impression that the heroes of\nthis formidable struggle seemed to belong to a race of supermen\nor Titans.\n\nThe epithet ``giant'' seemed justified so long as the events of\nthe period were confused and massed together.  Regarded as\nconnected when it was simply simultaneous, the work of the armies\nwas confounded with that of the Convention.  The glory of the\nfirst recoiled upon the second, and served as an excuse for the\nhecatombs of the Terror, the ferocity of the civil war, and the\ndevastation of France.\n\nUnder the penetrating scrutiny of modern criticism, the\nheterogeneous mass of events has been slowly disentangled.  The\narmies of the Republic have retained their old prestige, but we\nhave been forced to recognise that the men of the Convention,\nabsorbed entirely by their intestine conflicts, had very little\nto do with their victories.  At the most two or three members of\nthe committees of the Assembly were concerned with the armies,\nand the fact that they were victorious was due, apart from their\nnumbers and the talents of their young generals, to the\nenthusiasm with which a new faith had inspired them.\n\nIn a later chapter, devoted to the revolutionary armies, we shall\nsee how they conquered Europe in arms.  They set out inspired by\nthe ideas of liberty and equality which constituted the new\ngospel, and once on the frontiers, which were to keep them so\nlong, they retained a special mentality, very different from that\nof the Government, which they first knew nothing of and\nafterwards despised.\n\nHaving no part whatever in their victories, the men of the\nConvention contented themselves with legislating at hazard\naccording to the injunctions of the leaders who directed them,\nand who claimed to be regenerating France by means of the\nguillotine.\n\nBut it was thanks to these valiant armies that the history of the\nConvention was transformed into an apotheosis which affected\nseveral generations with a religious respect which even to-day is\nhardly extinct.\n\nStudying in detail the psychology of the ``Giants'' of the\nConvention, we find their magnitude shrink very rapidly.  They\nwere in general extremely mediocre.  Their most fervent\ndefenders, such as M. Aulard, are obliged to admit as much.\n\nThis is how M. Aulard puts it in his History of the French\nRevolution:--\n\n``It has been said that the generation which from 1789 to 1799\ndid such great and terrible things was a generation of giants,\nor, to put it more plainly, that it was a generation more\ndistinguished than that which preceded it or that which followed.\n\nThis is a retrospective illusion.  The citizens who formed the\nmunicipal and Jacobin or nationalist groups by which the\nRevolution was effected do not seem to have been superior, either\nin enlightenment or in talents, to the Frenchmen of the time of\nLouis XV. or of Louis Philippe.  Were those exceptionally gifted\nwhose names history has retained because they appeared on the\nstage of Paris, or because they were the most brilliant orators\nof the various revolutionary Assemblies?  Mirabeau, up to a\ncertain point, deserved the title of genius; but as to the rest--\nRobespierre, Danton, Vergniaud--had they truly more talent, for\nexample, than our modern orators?  In 1793, in the time of the\nsupposed `giants,' Mme. Roland wrote in her memoirs:  `France was\nas though drained of men; their dearth during this revolution is\ntruly surprising; there have scarcely been any but pigmies.' ''\n\nIf after considering the men of the Convention individually we\nconsider them in a body, we may say that they did not shine\neither by intelligence or by virtue or by courage.  Never did a\nbody of men manifest such pusillanimity.  They had no courage\nsave in their speeches or in respect of remote dangers.  This\nAssembly, so proud and threatening in its speech when addressing\nroyalty, was perhaps the most timid and docile political\ncollectivity that the world has ever known.  We see it slavishly\nobedient to the orders of the clubs and the Commune, trembling\nbefore the popular delegations which invaded it daily, and\nobeying the injunctions of the rioters to the point of handing\nover to them its most brilliant members.  The Convention affords\nthe world a melancholy spectacle, voting, at the popular behest,\nlaws so absurd that it is obliged to annul them as soon as the\nrioters have quitted the hall.\n\nFew Assemblies have given proof of such weakness.  When we wish\nto show how low a popular Government can fall we have only to\npoint to the Convention.\n\n\n2.  Results of the Triumph of the Jacobin Religion\n\n\nAmong the causes that gave the Convention its special\nphysiognomy, one of the most important was the definite\nestablishment of a revolutionary religion.  A dogma which was at\nfirst in process of formation was at last finally erected.\n\nThis dogma was composed of an aggregate of somewhat inconsistent\nelements.  Nature, the rights of man, liberty, equality, the\nsocial contract, hatred of tyrants, and popular sovereignty\nformed the articles of a gospel which, to its disciples, was\nabove discussion.  The new truths had found apostles who were\ncertain of their power, and who finally, like believers all the\nworld over, sought to impose them by force.  No heed should be\ntaken of the opinion of unbelievers; they all deserved to be\nexterminated.\n\nThe hatred of heretics having been always, as we have seen, in\nrespect of the Reformation, an irreducible characteristic of\ngreat beliefs, we can readily comprehend the intolerance of the\nJacobin religion.\n\nThe history of the Reformation proves also that the conflict\nbetween two allied beliefs is very bitter.  We must not,\ntherefore, be astonished that in the Convention the Jacobins\nfought furiously against the other republicans, whose faith\nhardly differed from their own.\n\nThe propaganda of the new apostles was very energetic.  To\nconvert the provinces they sent thither zealous disciples\nescorted by guillotines.  The inquisitors of the new faith would\nhave no paltering with error.  As Robespierre said, ``The\nrepublic is the destruction of everything that is opposed to\nit.''  What matter that the country refused to be regenerated?\nIt should be regenerated despite itself.  ``We will make a\ncemetery of France,'' said Carrier, ``rather than fail to\nregenerate it in our own way.''\n\nThe Jacobin policy derived from the new faith was very simple.\nIt consisted in a sort of equalitarian Socialism, directed by a\ndictatorship which would brook no opposition.\n\nOf practical ideas consistent with the economic necessities and\nthe true nature of man, the theorists who ruled France would have\nnothing to say.  Speech and the guillotine sufficed them.  Their\nspeeches were childish.  ``Never a fact,'' says Taine, ``nothing\nbut abstractions, strings of sentences about Nature, reason, the\npeople, tyrants, liberty: like so many puffed-out balloons\nuselessly jostling in space.  If we did not know that it all\nended in practical and dreadful results, we should think they\nwere games of logic, school exercises, academical demonstrations,\nideological combinations.''\n\nThe theories of the Jacobins amounted practically to an absolute\ntyranny.  To them it seemed evident that a sovereign State must\nbe obeyed without discussion by citizens rendered equal as to\nconditions and fortune.\n\nThe power with which they invested themselves was far greater\nthan that of the monarchs who had preceded them.  They fixed the\nprices of merchandise and arrogated the right to dispose of the\nlife and property of citizens.\n\nTheir confidence in the regenerative virtues of the revolutionary\nfaith was such that after having declared war upon kings they\ndeclared war upon the gods.  A calendar was established from\nwhich the saints were banished.  They created a new divinity,\nReason, whose worship was celebrated in Notre-Dame, with\nceremonies which were in many ways identical with those of the\nCatholic faith, upon the altar of the ``late Holy Virgin.''  This\ncult lasted until Robespierre substituted a personal religion of\nwhich he constituted himself the high priest.\n\nThe sole masters of France, the Jacobins and their\ndisciples were able to plunder the country with impunity,\nalthough they were never in the majority anywhere.\n\nTheir numbers are not easy to determine exactly.  We know only\nthat they were very small.  Taine valued them at 5,000 in Paris,\namong 700,000 inhabitants; in Besancon 300 among 300,000; and\nin all France about 300,000.\n\n``A small feudality of brigands, set over a conquered France,''\naccording to the words of the same author, they were able, in\nspite of their small numbers, to dominate the country, and this\nfor several reasons.  In the first place, their faith gave them a\nconsiderable strength.  Then, because they represented the\nGovernment, and for centuries the French had obeyed those who\nwere in command.  Finally, because it was believed that to\noverthrow them would be to bring back the ancien regime,\nwhich was greatly dreaded by the numerous purchasers of the\nnational domains.  Their tyranny must have grown frightful indeed\nto force so many departments to rise against them.\n\nThe first factor of their power was very important.  In the\nconflict between powerful faiths and weak faiths victory never\nfalls to the latter.  A powerful faith creates strong wills,\nwhich will always overpower weak wills.  That the Jacobins\nthemselves did finally perish was because their accumulated\nviolence had bound together thousands of weak wills whose united\nweight overbalanced their own strong wills.\n\nIt is true that the Girondists, whom the Jacobins persecuted with\nso much hatred, had also well-established beliefs, but in the\nstruggle which ensued their education told against them,\ntogether with their respect for certain traditions and the rights\nof others, scruples which did not in the least trouble their\nadversaries.\n\n``The majority of the sentiments of the Girondists,'' writes\nEmile Ollivier, ``were delicate and generous; those of the\nJacobin mob were low, gross, and brutal.  The name of Vergniaud,\ncompared with that of the `divine' Marat, measures a gulf which\nnothing could span.''\n\nDominating the Convention at the outset by the superiority of\ntheir talents and their eloquence, the Girondists soon fell under\nthe domination of the Montagnards--worthless energumens, who\ncarried little weight, but were always active, and who knew how\nto excite the passions of the populace.  It was violence and not\ntalent that impressed the Assemblies.\n\n\n3.  Mental Characteristics of the Convention.\n\n\nBeside the characteristics common to all assemblies there are\nsome created by influences of environment and circumstances,\nwhich give any particular assembly of men a special physiognomy.\nMost of the characteristics observable in the Constituent and\nLegislative Assemblies reappeared, in an exaggerated form, in the\nConvention.\n\nThis Assembly comprised about seven hundred and fifty deputies,\nof whom rather more than a third had sat in the Constituent or\nthe Legislative Assembly.  By terrorising the population the\nJacobins contrived to triumph at the elections.  The majority of\nthe electors, six millions out of seven, preferred to abstain\nfrom voting.\n\nAs to the professions, the Assembly contained a large number of\nlawyers, advocates, notaries, bailiffs, ex-magistrates, and a few\nliterary men.\n\nThe mentality of the Convention was not homogeneous.  Now, an\nassembly composed of individuals of widely different characters\nsoon splits up into a number of groups.  The Convention very\nearly contained three--the Gironde, the Mountain, and the Plain.\nThe constitutional monarchists had almost disappeared.\n\nThe Gironde and the Mountain, extreme parties, consisted of about\na hundred members apiece, who successively became leaders.  In\nthe Mountain were the most advanced members:  Couthon, Herault\nde Sechelles, Danton, Camille Desmoulins, Marat, Collot\nd'Herbois, Billaud-Varennes, Barras, Saint-Just, Fouche,\nTallien, Carrier, Robespierre, &c.  In the Gironde were Brissot,\nPetion, Condorcet, Vergniaud, &c.\n\nThe five hundred other members of the Assembly--that is, the\ngreat majority--constituted what was known as the Plain.\n\nThis latter formed a floating mass, silent, undecided, and timid;\nready to follow every impulse and to be carried away by the\nexcitement of the moment.  It gave ear indifferently to the\nstronger of the two preceding groups.  After obeying the Gironde\nfor some time it allowed itself to be led away by the Mountain,\nwhen the latter triumphed over its enemy.  This was a natural\nconsequence of the law already stated, by which the weak\ninvariably fall under the dominion of the stronger wills.\n\nThe influence of great manipulators of men was displayed\nin a high degree during the Convention.  It was constantly led by\na violent minority of narrow minds, whose intense convictions\nlent them great strength.\n\nA brutal and audacious minority will always lead a fearful and\nirresolute majority.  This explains the constant tendency toward\nextremes to be observed in all revolutionary assemblies.  The\nhistory of the Convention verifies once more the law of\nacceleration studied in another chapter.\n\nThe men of the Convention were thus bound to pass from moderation\nto greater and greater violence.  Finally they decimated\nthemselves.  Of the 180 Girondists who at the outset led the\nConvention 140 were killed or fled, and finally the most\nfanatical of the Terrorists, Robespierre, reigned alone over a\nterrified crowd of servile representatives.\n\nYet it was among the five hundred members of the majority,\nuncertain and floating as it was, that the intelligence and\nexperience were to be found.  The technical committees to whom\nthe useful work of the Convention was due were recruited from the\nPlain.\n\nMore or less indifferent to politics, the members of the Plain\nwere chiefly anxious that no one should pay particular attention\nto them.  Shut up in their committees, they showed themselves as\nlittle as possible in the Assembly, which explains why the\nsessions of the Convention contained barely a third of the\ndeputies.\n\nUnhappily, as often happens, these intelligent and honest men\nwere completely devoid of character, and the fear which always\ndominated them made them vote for the worst of the\nmeasures introduced by their dreaded masters.\n\nThe men of the Plain voted for everything they were ordered to\nvote for--the creation of the Revolutionary Tribunal, the Terror,\n&c.  It was with their assistance that the Mountain crushed the\nGironde, and Robespierre destroyed the Hebertists and\nDantonists.  Like all weak people, they followed the strong.  The\ngentle philanthropists who composed the Plain, and constituted\nthe majority of the Assembly, contributed, by their\npusillanimity, to bring about the frightful excesses of the\nConvention.\n\nThe psychological note always prevailing in the Convention was a\nhorrible fear.  It was more especially through fear that men cut\noff one another's heads, in the doubtful hope of keeping their\nown on their shoulders.\n\nSuch a fear was, of course, very comprehensible.  The unhappy\ndeputies deliberated amid the hootings and vociferations of the\ntribunes.  At every moment veritable savages, armed with pikes,\ninvaded the Assembly, and the majority of the members no longer\ndared to attend the sessions.  When by chance they did go it was\nonly to vote in silence according to the orders of the Mountain,\nwhich was only a third as numerous.\n\nThe fear which dominated the latter, although less visible, was\njust as profound.  Men destroyed their enemies, not only because\nthey were shallow fanatics, but because they were convinced that\ntheir own existence was threatened.  The judges of the\nrevolutionary Tribunals trembled no less.  They would have\nwillingly acquitted Danton, and the widow of Camille\nDesmoulins, and many others.  They dared not.\n\nBut it was above all when Robespierre became the sole master that\nthe phantom of fear oppressed the Assembly.  It has truly been\nsaid that a glance from the master made his colleagues shrink\nwith fear.  On their faces one read ``the pallor of fear and the\nabandon of despair.''\n\nAll feared Robespierre and Robespierre feared all.  It was\nbecause he feared conspiracies against him that he cut off men's\nheads, and it was also through fear that others allowed him to do\nso.\n\nThe memoirs of members of the Convention show plainly what a\nhorrible memory they retained of this gloomy period.  Questioned\ntwenty years later, says Taine, on the true aim and the intimate\nthoughts of the Committee of Public Safety, Barrere replied:--\n\n``We had only one feeling, that of self-preservation; only one\ndesire, that of preserving our lives, which each of us believed\nto be threatened.  You had your neighbour's head cut off so that\nyour neighbour should not have you yourself guillotined.''\n\nThe history of the Convention constitutes one of the most\nstriking examples that could be given of the influence of leaders\nand of fear upon an assembly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF THE CONVENTION\n\n1.  The activity of the Clubs and the Commune during the\nConvention.\n\nDuring the whole of its existence the Convention was governed by\nthe leaders of the clubs and of the Commune.\n\nWe have already seen what was their influence on the preceding\nAssemblies.  It became overwhelming during the Convention.  The\nhistory of this latter is in reality that of the clubs and the\nCommune which dominated it.  They enslaved, not only the\nConvention, but also all France.  Numerous little provincial\nclubs, directed by that of the capital, supervised magistrates,\ndenounced suspects, and undertook the execution of all the\nrevolutionary orders.\n\nWhen the clubs or the Commune had decided upon certain measures\nthey had them voted by the Assembly then and there.  If the\nAssembly resisted, they sent their armed delegations thither--\nthat is, armed bands recruited from the scum of the populace.\nThey conveyed injunctions which were always slavishly obeyed.\nThe Commune was so sure of its strength that it even demanded of\nthe Convention the immediate expulsion of deputies who displeased\nit.\n\nWhile the Convention was composed generally of educated\nmen, the members of the Commune and the clubs comprised a\nmajority of small shopkeepers, labourers, and artisans, incapable\nof personal opinions, and always guided by their leaders--Danton,\nCamille Desmoulins, Robespierre, &c.\n\nOf the two powers, clubs and insurrectionary Commune, the latter\nexercised the greater influence in Paris, because it had made for\nitself a revolutionary army.  It held under its orders forty-\neight committees of National Guards, who asked nothing more than\nto kill, sack, and, above all, plunder.\n\nThe tyranny with which the Commune crushed Paris was frightful.\nFor example, it delegated to a certain cobbler, Chalandon by\nname, the right of surveillance over a portion of the capital--a\nright implying the power to send to the Revolutionary Tribunal,\nand therefore to the guillotine, all those whom he suspected.\nCertain streets were thus almost depopulated by him.\n\nThe Convention struggled feebly against the Commune at the\noutset, but did not prolong its resistance.  The culminating\npoint of the conflict occurred when the Convention wished to\narrest Hebert, the friend of the Commune, and the latter sent\narmed bands who threatened the Assembly and demanded the\nexpulsion of the Girondists who had provoked the measure.  Upon\nthe Convention refusing the Commune besieged it on June 2, 1798,\nby means of its revolutionary army, which was under the orders of\nHanriot.  Terrified, the Assembly gave up twenty-seven of its\nmembers.  The Commune immediately sent a delegation ironically to\nfelicitate it upon its obedience.\n\nAfter the fall of the Girondists the Convention submitted itself\ncompletely to the injunctions of the omnipotent Commune.  The\nlatter decreed the levy of a revolutionary army, to be\naccompanied by a tribunal and a guillotine, which was to traverse\nthe whole of France in order to execute suspects.\n\nOnly towards the end of its existence, after the fall of\nRobespierre, did the Convention contrive to escape from the yoke\nof the Jacobins and the Commune.  It closed the Jacobin club and\nguillotined its leading members.\n\nDespite such sanctions the leaders still continued to excite the\npopulace and hurl it against the Convention.  In Germinal and\nPrairial it underwent regular sieges.  Armed delegations even\nsucceeded in forcing the Convention to vote the re-establishment\nof the Commune and the convocation of a new Assembly, a measure\nwhich the Convention hastened to annul the moment the insurgents\nhad withdrawn.  Ashamed of its fear, it sent for regiments which\ndisarmed the faubourgs and made nearly ten thousand arrests.\nTwenty-six leaders of the movement were put to death, and six\ndeputies who were concerned in the riot were guillotined.\n\nBut the Convention did not resist to any purpose.  When it was no\nlonger led by the clubs and the Commune it obeyed the Committee\nof Public Safety and voted its decrees without discussion.\n\n``The Convention,'' writes H.  Williams, ``which spoke of nothing\nless than having all the princes and kings of Europe brought to\nits feet loaded with chains, was made prisoner in its own\nsanctuary by a handful of mercenaries.''\n\n\n2.  The Government of France during the Convention--The Terror.\n\n\nAs soon as it assembled in 1792 the Convention began by decreeing\nthe abolition of royalty, and in spite of the hesitation of a\ngreat number of its members, who knew that the provinces were\nroyalist, it proclaimed the Republic.\n\nIntimately persuaded that such a proclamation would transform the\ncivilised world, it instituted a new era and a new calendar.  The\nyear I. of this era marked the dawn of a world in which reason\nalone was to reign.  It was inaugurated by the trial of Louis\nXVI., a measure which was ordered by the Commune, but which the\nmajority of the Convention did not desire.\n\nAt its outset, in fact, the Convention was governed by its\nrelatively moderate elements, the Girondists.  The president and\nthe secretaries had been chosen among the best known of this\nparty.  Robespierre, who was later to become the absolute master\nof the Convention, possessed so little influence at this time\nthat he obtained only six votes for the presidency, while\nPetion received two hundred and thirty-five.\n\nThe Montagnards had at first only a very slight influence.  Their\npower was of later growth.  When they were in power there was no\nlonger room in the Convention for moderate members.\n\nDespite their minority the Montagnards found a way to force the\nAssembly to bring Louis to trial.  This was at once a victory\nover the Girondists, the condemnation of all kings, and a final\ndivorce between the old order and the new.\n\nTo bring about the trial they manoeuvred very skilfully,\nbombarding the Convention with petitions from the provinces, and\nsending a deputation from the insurrectional Commune of Paris,\nwhich demanded a trial.\n\nAccording to a characteristic common to the Assemblies of the\nRevolution, that of yielding to threats and always doing the\ncontrary of what they wished, the men of the Convention dared not\nresist.  The trial was decided upon.\n\nThe Girondists, who individually would not have wished for the\ndeath of the king, voted for it out of fear once they were\nassembled.  Hoping to save his own head, the Duc d'Orleans,\nLouis' cousin, voted with them.  If, on mounting the scaffold on\nJanuary 21, 1793, Louis had had that vision of the future which\nwe attribute to the gods, he would have seen following him, one\nby one, the greater number of the Girondists whose weakness had\nbeen unable to defend him.\n\nRegarded only from the purely utilitarian point of view, the\nexecution of the king was one of the mistakes of the Revolution.\nIt engendered civil war and armed Europe against France.  In the\nConvention itself his death gave rise to intestine struggles,\nwhich finally led to the triumph of the Montagnards and the\nexpulsion of the Girondists.\n\nThe measures passed under the influence of the Montagnards\nfinally became so despotic that sixty departments, comprising the\nWest and the South, revolted.  The insurrection, which was headed\nby many of the expelled deputies, would perhaps have succeeded\nhad not the compromising assistance of the royalists caused men\nto fear the return of the ancien regime.  At Toulon, in fact, the\ninsurgents acclaimed Louis XVII.\n\nThe civil war thus begun lasted during the greater part of the\nlife of the Revolution.  It was fought with the utmost savagery.\nOld men, women, children, all were massacred, and villages and\ncrops were burned.  In the Vendee alone the number of the killed\nwas reckoned at something between half a million and a million.\n\nCivil war was soon followed by foreign war.  The Jacobins thought\nto remedy all these ills by creating a new Constitution.  It was\nalways a tradition with all the revolutionary assemblies to\nbelieve in the magic virtues of formula.  In France this\nconviction has never been affected by the failure of experiments.\n\n``A robust faith,'' writes one of the great admirers of the\nRevolution, M. Rambaud, ``sustained the Convention in this\nlabour; it believed firmly that when it had formulated in a law\nthe principles of the Revolution its enemies would be confounded,\nor, still better, converted, and that the advent of justice would\ndisarm the insurgents.''\n\nDuring its lifetime the Convention drafted two Constitutions--\nthat of 1793, or the year I., and that of 1795, or the year III.\nThe first was never applied, an absolute dictatorship very soon\nreplacing it; the second created the Directory.\n\nThe Convention contained a large number of lawyers and men of\naffairs, who promptly comprehended the impossibility of\ngovernment by means of a large Assembly.  They soon divided the\nConvention into small committees, each of which had an\nindependent existence--business committees, committees of\nlegislation, finance, agriculture, arts, &c.  These committees\nprepared the laws which the Assembly usually voted with its eyes\nclosed.\n\nThanks to them, the work of the Convention was not purely\ndestructive.  They drafted many very useful measures, creating\nimportant colleges, establishing the metric system, &c.  The\nmajority of the members of the Assembly, as we have already seen,\ntook refuge in these committees in order to evade the political\nconflict which would have endangered their heads.\n\nAbove the business committees, which had nothing to do with\npolitics, was the Committee of Public Safety, instituted in\nApril, 1793, and composed of nine members.  Directed at first by\nDanton, and in the July of the same year by Robespierre, it\ngradually absorbed all the powers of government, including that\nof giving orders to ministers and generals.  Carnot directed the\noperations of the war, Cambon the finances, and Saint-Just and\nCollot-d'Herbois the general policy.\n\nAlthough the laws voted by the technical committees were often\nvery wise, and constituted the lasting work of the Convention,\nthose which the Assembly voted in a body under the threats of the\ndelegations which invaded it were manifestly ridiculous.\n\nAmong these laws, which were not greatly in the interests of the\npublic or of the Convention itself, were the law of the maximum,\nvoted in September, 1793, which pretended to fix the price of\nprovisions, and which merely established a continual dearth; the\ndestruction of the royal tombs at Saint-Denis; the trial\nof the queen, the systematic devastation of the Vendee by\nfire, the establishment of the Revolutionary Tribunal, &c.\n\nThe Terror was the chief means of government during the\nConvention.  Commencing in September, 1793, it reigned for six\nmonths--that is, until the death of Robespierre.  Vainly did\ncertain Jacobins-- Danton, Camille Desmoulins, Herault de\nSechelles, &c.--propose that clemency should be given a trial.\nThe only result of this proposition was that its authors were\nsent to the scaffold.  It was merely the lassitude of the public\nthat finally put an end to this shameful period.\n\nThe successive struggles of the various parties in the Convention\nand its tendency towards extremes eliminated one by one the men\nof importance who had once played their part therein.  Finally it\nfell under the exclusive domination of Robespierre.  While the\nConvention was disorganising and ravaging France, the armies were\nwinning brilliant victories.  They had seized the left bank of\nthe Rhine, Belgium, and Holland.  The treaty of Basle ratified\nthese conquests.\n\nWe have already mentioned, and we shall return to the matter\nagain, that the work of the armies must be considered absolutely\napart from that of the Convention.  Contemporaries understood\nthis perfectly, but to-day it is often forgotten.\n\nWhen the Convention was dissolved, in 1795, after lasting for\nthree years, it was regarded with universal distrust.  The\nperpetual plaything of popular caprice, it had not succeeded in\npacifying France, but had plunged her into anarchy.  The\ngeneral opinion respecting the Convention is well summed up in a\nletter written in July, 1799, by the Swedish charge\nd'affaires, Baron Drinkmann:  ``I venture to hope that no people\nwill ever be governed by the will of more cruel and imbecile\nscoundrels than those that have ruled France since the beginning\nof her new liberty.''\n\n\n3.  The End of the Convention.  The Beginnings of the Directory.\n\n\nAt the end of its existence, the Convention, always trusting to\nthe power of formulae, drafted a new Constitution, that of the\nyear III., intended to replace that of 1793, which had never been\nput into execution.  The legislative power was to be shared by a\nso-called Council of Ancients composed of 150 members, and a\ncouncil of deputies numbering 500.  The executive power was\nconfided to a Directory of five members, who were appointed by\nthe Ancients upon nomination by the Five Hundred, and renewed\nevery year by the election of one of their number.  It was\nspecified that two-thirds of the members of the new Assembly\nshould be chosen from among the deputies of the Convention.  This\nprudent measure was not very efficacious, as only ten departments\nremained faithful to the Jacobins.\n\nTo avoid the election of royalists, the Convention had decided to\nbanish all emigres in perpetuity.\n\nThe announcement of this Constitution did not produce the\nanticipated effect upon the public.  It had no effect upon the\npopular riots, which continued.  One of the most important was\nthat which threatened the Convention on the 5th of October, 1795.\n\nThe leaders hurled a veritable army upon the Assembly.\nBefore such provocation, the Convention finally decided to defend\nitself, and sent for troops, entrusting the command to Barras.\n\nBonaparte, who was then beginning to emerge from obscurity, was\nentrusted with the task of repression.  With such a leader action\nwas swift and energetic.  Vigorously pounded with ball near the\nchurch at St. Roch, the insurgents fled, leaving some hundreds of\ndead on the spot.\n\nThis action, which displayed a firmness to which the Convention\nwas little habituated, was only due to the celerity of the\nmilitary operations, for while these were being carried out the\ninsurgents had sent delegates to the Assembly, which, as usual,\nshowed itself quite ready to yield to them.\n\nThe repression of this riot constituted the last important act of\nthe Convention.  On the 26th of October, 1795, it declared its\nmission terminated, and gave way to the Directory.\n\nWe have already laid stress upon some of the psychological\nlessons furnished by the government of the Convention.  One of\nthe most striking of these is the impotence of violence to\ndominate men's minds in permanence.\n\nNever did any Government possess such formidable means of action,\nyet in spite of the permanent guillotine, despite the delegates\nsent with the guillotine into the provinces, despite its\nDraconian laws, the Convention had to struggle perpetually\nagainst riots, insurrections, and conspiracies.  The cities, the\ndepartments, and the faubourgs of Paris were continually rising\nin revolt, although heads were falling by the thousand.\n\nThis Assembly, which thought itself sovereign, fought against the\ninvincible forces which were fixed in men's minds, and which\nmaterial constraint was powerless to overcome.  Of these hidden\nmotive forces it never understood the power, and it struggled\nagainst them in vain.  In the end the invisible forces triumphed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nINSTANCES OF REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE\n\n1.  Psychological Causes of Revolutionary Violence.\n\nWe have shown in the course of the preceding chapters that the\nrevolutionary theories constituted a new faith.\n\nHumanitarian and sentimental, they exalted liberty and\nfraternity.  But, as in many religions, we can observe a complete\ncontradiction between doctrine and action.  In practice no\nliberty was tolerated, and fraternity was quickly replaced by\nfrenzied massacres.\n\nThis opposition between principles and conduct results from the\nintolerance which accompanies all beliefs.  A religion may be\nsteeped in humanitarianism and forbearance, but its sectaries\nwill always want to impose it on others by force, so that\nviolence is the inevitable result.\n\nThe cruelties of the Revolution were thus the inherent results of\nthe propagation of the new dogmas.  The Inquisition, the\nreligious wars of France, St. Bartholomew's Day, the revocation\nof the Edict of Nantes, the ``Dragonnades,'' the persecution of\nthe Jansenists, &c., belonged to the same family as the Terror\nand derived from the same psychological sources.\n\nLouis XIV. was not a cruel king, yet under the impulse of\nhis faith he drove hundreds of thousands of Protestants out of\nFrance, after first shooting down a considerable number and\nsending others to the galleys.\n\nThe methods of persuasion adopted by all believers are by no\nmeans a consequence of their fear of the dissentient opposition.\nProtestants and Jansenists were anything but dangerous under\nLouis XIV.  Intolerance arises above all from the indignation\nexperienced by a mind which is convinced that it possesses the\nmost dazzling verities against the men who deny those truths, and\nwho are surely not acting in good faith.  How can one support\nerror when one has the necessary strength to wipe it out?\n\nThus have reasoned the believers of all ages.  Thus reasoned\nLouis XIV. and the men of the Terror.  These latter also were\nconvinced that they were in possession of absolute truths, which\nthey believed to be obvious, and whose triumph was certain to\nregenerate humanity.  Could they be more tolerant toward their\nadversaries than the Church and the kings of France had been\ntoward heretics?\n\nWe are forced to believe that terror is a method which all\nbelievers regard as a necessity, since from the beginning of the\nages religious codes have always been based upon terror.  To\nforce men to observe their prescriptions, believers have sought\nto terrify them with threats of an eternal hell of torments.\n\nThe apostles of the Jacobin belief behaved as their fathers had\ndone, and employed the same methods.  If similar events occurred\nagain we should see identical actions repeated.  If a new\nbelief--Socialism, for example--were to triumph to-morrow, it\nwould be led to employ methods of propaganda like those of\nthe Inquisition and the Terror.\n\nBut were we to regard the Jacobin Terror solely as the result of\na religious movement, we should not completely apprehend it.\nAround a triumphant religious belief, as we saw in the case of\nthe Reformation, gather a host of individual interests which are\ndependent on that belief.  The Terror was directed by a few\nfanatical apostles, but beside this small number of ardent\nproselytes, whose narrow minds dreamed of regenerating the world,\nwere great numbers of men who lived only to enrich themselves.\nThey rallied readily around the first victorious leader who\npromised to enable them to enjoy the results of their pillage.\n\n``The Terrorists of the Revolution,'' writes Albert Sorel,\n``resorted to the Terror because they wished to remain in power,\nand were incapable of doing so by other means.  They employed it\nfor their own salvation, and after the event they stated that\ntheir motive was the salvation of the State.  Before it became a\nsystem it was a means of government, and the system was only\ninvented to justify the means.''\n\nWe may thus fully agree with the following verdict on the Terror,\nwritten by Emile Ollivier in his work on the Revolution:  ``The\nTerror was above all a Jacquerie, a regularised pillage, the\nvastest enterprise of theft that any association of criminals has\never organised.''\n\n\n2.  The Revolutionary Tribunals.\n\n\nThe Revolutionary Tribunals constituted the principal means of\naction of the Terror.  Besides that of Paris, created at the\ninstigation of Danton, and which a year afterwards sent\nits founder to the guillotine, France was covered with\nsuch tribunals.\n\n``One hundred and seventy-eight tribunals,'' says Taine, ``of\nwhich 40 were perambulant, pronounced death sentences in all\nparts of the country, which were carried out instantly on the\nspot.  Between the 16th of April, 1793, and the 9th of Thermidor\nin the year II. that of Paris guillotined 2,625 persons, and the\nprovincial judges worked as hard as those of Paris.  In the\nlittle town of Orange alone 331 persons were guillotined.  In the\ncity of Arras 299 men and 93 women were guillotined. . . .  In\nthe city of Lyons alone the revolutionary commissioner admitted\nto 1,684 executions. . . .  The total number of these murders has\nbeen put at 17,000, among whom were 1,200 women, of whom a number\nwere octogenarians.''\n\nAlthough the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris claimed only 2,625\nvictims, it must not be forgotten that all the suspects had\nalready been summarily massacred during the ``days'' of\nSeptember.\n\nThe Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris, a mere instrument of the\nCommittee of Public Safety, limited itself in reality, as\nFouquier-Tinville justly remarked during his trial, to executing\nits orders.  It surrounded itself at first with a few legal forms\nwhich did not long survive.  Interrogatory, defence, witnesses--\nall were finally suppressed.  Moral proof--that is, mere\nsuspicion--sufficed to procure condemnation.  The president\nusually contented himself with putting a vague question to the\naccused.  To work more rapidly still, Fouquier-Tinville proposed\nto have the guillotine installed on the same premises as the\nTribunal.\n\nThis Tribunal sent indiscriminately to the scaffold all the\naccused persons arrested by reason of party hatred, and very\nsoon, in the hands of Robespierre, it constituted an instrument\nof the bloodiest tyranny.  When Danton, one of its founders,\nbecame its victim, he justly asked pardon of God and men, before\nmounting the scaffold for having assisted to create such a\nTribunal.\n\nNothing found mercy before it: neither the genius of Lavoisier,\nnor the gentleness of Lucile Desmoulins, nor the merit of\nMalesherbes.  ``So much talent,'' said Benjamin Constant,\n``massacred by the most cowardly and brutish of men!''\n\nTo find any excuse for the Revolutionary Tribunal, we must return\nto our conception of the religious mentality of the Jacobins, who\nfounded and directed it.  It was a piece of work comparable in\nits spirit and its aim to the Inquisition.  The men who furnished\nits victims--Robespierre, Saint-Just, and Couthon--believed\nthemselves the benefactors of the human race in suppressing all\ninfidels, the enemies of the faith that was to regenerate the\nearth.\n\nThe executions during the Terror did not affect the members of\nthe aristocracy only, since 4,000 peasants and 3,000 working-men\nwere guillotined.\n\nGiven the emotion produced in Paris in our days by a capital\nexecution, one might suppose that the execution of so many\npersons at one time would produce a very great emotion.  But\nhabit had so dulled sensibility that people paid but little\nattention to the matter at last.  Mothers would take their\nchildren to see people guillotined as to-day they take them to\nthe marionette theatre.\n\nThe daily spectacle of executions made the men of the time\nvery indifferent to death.  All mounted the scaffold with perfect\ntranquillity, the Girondists singing the Marseillaise as they\nclimbed the steps.\n\nThis resignation resulted from the law of habitude, which very\nrapidly dulls emotion.  To judge by the fact that royalist\nrisings were taking place daily, the prospect of the guillotine\nno longer terrified men.  Things happened as though the Terror\nterrorised no one.  Terror is an efficacious psychological\nprocess so long as it does not last.  The real terror resides far\nmore in threats than in their realisation.\n\n\n3.  The Terror in the Provinces.\n\n\nThe executions of the Revolutionary Tribunals in the provinces\nrepresented only a portion of the massacres effected in the\ndepartments during the Terror.  The revolutionary army, composed\nof vagabonds and brigands, marched through France killing and\npillaging.  Its method of procedure is well indicated by the\nfollowing passage from Taine:--\n\n``At Bedouin, a town of 2,000 inhabitants, where unknown hands\nhad cut down the tree of liberty, 433 houses were demolished or\nfired, 16 persons were guillotined, and 47 shot down; all the\nother inhabitants were expelled and reduced to living as\nvagabonds in the mountains, and to taking shelter in caverns\nwhich they hollowed out of the earth.''\n\nThe fate of the wretches sent before the Revolutionary Tribunals\nwas no better.  The first mockery of trial was quickly\nsuppressed.  At Nantes, Carrier drowned and shot down according\nto his fancy nearly 5,000 persons--men, women, and children.\n\nThe details of these massacres figured in the Moniteur\nafter the reaction of Thermidor.  I cite a few lines:--\n\n``I saw,'' says Thomas, ``after the taking of Noirmoutier, men\nand women and old people burned alive . . . women violated, girls\nof fourteen and fifteen, and massacred afterward, and tender\nbabes thrown from bayonet to bayonet; children who were taken\nfrom beside their mothers stretched out on the ground.''\n\nIn the same number we read a deposition by one Julien, relating\nhow Carrier forced his victims to dig their graves and to allow\nthemselves to be buried alive.  The issue of October 15, 1794,\ncontained a report by Merlin de Thionville proving that the\ncaptain of the vessel le Destin had received orders to embark\nforty-one victims to be drowned--``among them a blind man of 78,\ntwelve women, twelve girls, and fourteen children, of whom ten\nwere from 10 to 6 and five at the breast.''\n\nIn the course of Carrier's trial (Moniteur, December 30, 1794)\nit was proved that he ``had given orders to drown and shoot women\nand children, and had ordered General Haxo to exterminate all the\ninhabitants of La Vendee and to burn down their dwellings.''\n\nCarrier, like all wholesale murderers, took an intense joy in\nseeing his victims suffer.  ``In the department in which I hunted\nthe priests,'' he said, ``I have never laughed so much or\nexperienced such pleasure as in watching their dying grimaces''\n(Moniteur, December 22, 1794).\n\nCarrier was tried to satisfy the reaction of Thermidor.  But\nthe massacres of Nantes were repeated in many other towns.\nFouche slew more than 2,000 persons at Lyons, and so many were\nkilled at Toulon that the population fell from 29,000 to 7,000 in\na few months.\n\nWe must say in defence of Carrier, Freron, Fouche and all\nthese sinister persons, that they were incessantly stimulated by\nthe Committee of Public Safety.  Carrier gave proof of this\nduring his trial.\n\n``I admit,'' said he (Moniteur, December 24, 1794), ``that 150\nor 200 prisoners were shot every day, but it was by order of the\ncommission.  I informed the Convention that the brigands were\nbeing shot down by hundreds, and it applauded this letter, and\nordered its insertion in the Bulletin.  What were these deputies\ndoing then who are so furious against me now?  They were\napplauding.  Why did they still keep me `on mission'?  Because I\nwas then the saviour of the country, and now I am a bloodthirsty\nman.''\n\nUnhappily for him, Carrier did not know, as he remarked in the\nsame speech, that only seven or eight persons led the Convention.\n\nBut the terrorised Assembly approved of all that these seven or\neight ordered, so that they could say nothing in reply to\nCarrier's argument.  He certainly deserved to be guillotined, but\nthe whole Convention deserved to be guillotined with him, since\nit had approved of the massacres.\n\nThe defence of Carrier, justified by the letters of the\nCommittee, by which the representatives ``on mission'' were\nincessantly stimulated, shows that the violence of the Terror\nresulted from a system, and not, as has sometimes been claimed,\nfrom the initiative of a few individuals.\n\nThe thirst for destruction during the Terror was by no means\nassuaged by the destruction of human beings only; there was an\neven greater destruction of inanimate things.  The true believer\nis always an iconoclast.  Once in power, he destroys with equal\nzeal the enemies of his faith and the images, temples, and\nsymbols which recall the faith attacked.\n\nWe know that the first action of the Emperor Theodosius when\nconverted to the Christian religion was to break down the\nmajority of the temples which for six thousand years had been\nbuilt beside the Nile.  We must not, therefore, be surprised to\nsee the leaders of the Revolution attacking the monuments and\nworks of art which for them were the vestiges of an abhorred\npast.\n\nStatues, manuscripts, stained glass windows, and plate were\nfrenziedly broken.  When Fouche, the future Duke of Otranto\nunder Napoleon, and minister under Louis XVIII., was sent as\ncommissary of the Convention to the Nievre, he ordered the\ndemolition of all the towers of the chateaux and the\nbelfries of the churches ``because they wounded equality.''\n\nRevolutionary vandalism expended itself even on the tomb.\nFollowing a report read by Barrere to the Convention, the\nmagnificent royal tombs at Saint-Denis, among which was the\nadmirable mausoleum of Henri II., by Germain Pilon, were smashed\nto pieces, the coffins emptied, and the body of Turenne sent to\nthe Museum as a curiosity, after one of the keepers had extracted\nthe teeth in order to sell them as curiosities.  The moustache\nand beard of Henri IV. were also torn out.\n\nIt is impossible to witness such comparatively enlightened\nmen consenting to the destruction of the artistic patriotism of\nFrance without a feeling of sadness.  To excuse them, we must\nremember that intense beliefs give rise to the worst excesses,\nand also that the Convention, almost daily invaded by rioters,\nalways yielded to the popular will.\n\nThis glowing record of devastation proves, not only the power of\nfanaticism: it shows us what becomes of men who are liberated\nfrom all social restraints, and of the country which falls into\ntheir hands.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE ARMIES OF THE REVOLUTION\n\n1.  The Revolutionary Assemblies and the Armies.\n\nIf nothing were known of the revolutionary Assemblies, and\nnotably of the Convention, beyond their internal dissensions,\ntheir weakness, and their acts of violence, their memory would\nindeed be a gloomy one.\n\nBut even for its enemies this bloodstained epoch must always\nretain an undeniable glory, thanks to the success of its armies.\nWhen the Convention dissolved France was already the greater by\nBelgium and the territories on the left bank of the Rhine.\n\nRegarding the Convention as a whole, it seems equitable to credit\nit with the victories of the armies of France, but if we analyse\nthis whole in order to study each of its elements separately\ntheir independence will at once be obvious.  It is at once\napparent that the Convention had a very small share in the\nmilitary events of the time.  The armies on the frontier and the\nrevolutionary Assemblies in Paris formed two separate worlds,\nwhich had very little influence over one another, and which\nregarded matters in a very different light.\n\nWe have seen that the Convention was a weak Government, which\nchanged its ideas daily, according to popular impulse; it was\nreally an example of the profoundest anarchy.  It directed\nnothing, but was itself continually directed; how, then, could it\nhave commanded armies?\n\nCompletely absorbed in its intestine quarrels, the Assembly had\nabandoned all military questions to a special committee, which\nwas directed almost single-handed by Carnot, and whose real\nfunction was to furnish the troops with provisions and\nammunition.  The merit of Carnot consisted in the fact that\nbesides directing over 752,000 men at the disposal of France,\nupon points which were strategically valuable, he also advised\nthe generals of the armies to take the offensive, and to preserve\na strict discipline.\n\nThe sole share of the Assembly in the defence of the country was\nthe decree of the general levy.  In the face of the numerous\nenemies then threatening France, no Government could have avoided\nsuch a measure.  For some little time, too, the Assembly had sent\nrepresentatives to the armies instructed to decapitate certain\ngenerals, but this policy was soon abandoned.\n\nAs a matter of fact the military activities of the Assembly were\nalways extremely slight.  The armies, thanks to their numbers,\ntheir enthusiasm, and the tactics devised by their youthful\ngenerals, achieved their victories unaided.  They fought and\nconquered independently of the Convention.\n\n\n2.  The Struggle of Europe against the Revolution.\n\n\nBefore enumerating the various psychological factors which\ncontributed to the successes of the revolutionary armies, it will\nbe useful briefly to recall the origin and the development of the\nwar against Europe.\n\nAt the commencement of the Revolution the foreign sovereigns\nregarded with satisfaction the difficulties of the French\nmonarchy, which they had long regarded as a rival power.  The\nKing of Prussia, believing France to be greatly enfeebled,\nthought to enrich himself at her expense, so he proposed to the\nEmperor of Austria to help Louis on condition of receiving\nFlanders and Alsace as an indemnity.  The two sovereigns signed\nan alliance against France in February, 1792.  The French\nanticipated attack by declaring war upon Austria, under the\ninfluence of the Girondists.  The French army was at the outset\nsubjected to several checks.  The allies penetrated into\nChampagne, and came within 130 miles of Paris.  Dumouriez'\nvictory at Valmy forced them to retire.\n\nAlthough 300 French and 200 Prussians only were killed in this\nbattle, it had very significant results.  The fact that an army\nreputed invincible had been forced to retreat gave boldness to\nthe young revolutionary troops, and everywhere they took the\noffensive.  In a few weeks the soldiers of Valmy had chased the\nAustrians out of Belgium, where they were welcomed as liberators.\n\nBut it was under the Convention that the war assumed such\nimportance.  At the beginning of 1793 the Assembly declared that\nBelgium was united to France.  From this resulted a conflict with\nEngland which lasted for twenty-two years.\n\nAssembled at Antwerp in April, 1793, the representatives of\nEngland, Prussia, and Austria resolved to dismember France.  The\nPrussians were to seize Alsace and Lorraine; the Austrians,\nFlanders and Artois; the English, Dunkirk.  The Austrian\nambassador proposed to crush the Revolution by terror,\n``by exterminating practically the whole of the party directing\nthe nation.''  In the face of such declarations France had\nperforce to conquer or to perish.\n\nDuring this first coalition, between 1793 and 1797, France had to\nfight on all her frontiers, from the Pyrenees to the north.\n\nAt the outset she lost her former conquests, and suffered several\nreverses.  The Spaniards took Perpignan and Bayonne; the English,\nToulon; and the Austrians, Valenciennes.  It was then that the\nConvention, towards the end of 1793, ordered a general levy of\nall Frenchmen between the ages of eighteen and forty, and\nsucceeded in sending to the frontiers a total of some 750,000\nmen.  The old regiments of the royal army were combined with\nbattalions of volunteers and conscripts.\n\nThe allies were repulsed, and Maubeuge was relieved after the\nvictory of Wattigny, which was gained by Jourdan.  Hoche rescued\nLorraine.  France took the offensive, reconquering Belgium and\nthe left bank of the Rhine.  Jourdan defeated the Austrians at\nFleurus, drove them back upon the Rhine, and occupied Cologne and\nCoblentz.  Holland was invaded.  The allied sovereigns resigned\nthemselves to suing for peace, and recognised the French\nconquests.\n\nThe successes of the French were favoured by the fact that the\nenemy never put their whole heart into the affair, as they were\npreoccupied by the partition of Poland, which they effected in\n1793-5.  Each Power wished to be on the spot in order to obtain\nmore territory.  This motive had already caused the King\nof Prussia to retire after the battle of Valmy in 1792.\n\nThe hesitations of the allies and their mutual distrust were\nextremely advantageous to the French.  Had the Austrians marched\nupon Paris in the summer of 1793, ``we should,'' said General\nThiebault, ``have lost a hundred times for one.  They alone\nsaved us, by giving us time to make soldiers, officers, and\ngenerals.''\n\nAfter the treaty of Basle, France had no important adversaries on\nthe Continent, save the Austrians.  It was then that the\nDirectory attacked Austria in Italy.  Bonaparte was entrusted\nwith the charge of this campaign.  After a year of fighting, from\nApril, 1796, to April, 1797, he forced the last enemies of France\nto demand peace.\n\n\n3.  Psychological and Military Factors which determined the\nSuccess of the Revolutionary Armies.\n\n\nTo realise the causes of the success of the revolutionary armies\nwe must remember the prodigious enthusiasm, endurance, and\nabnegation of these ragged and often barefoot troops.  Thoroughly\nsteeped in revolutionary principles, they felt that they were the\napostles of a new religion, which was destined to regenerate the\nworld.\n\nThe history of the armies of the Revolution recalls that of the\nnomads of Arabia, who, excited to fanaticism by the ideals of\nMohammed, were transformed into formidable armies which rapidly\nconquered a portion of the old Roman world.  An analogous faith\nendowed the Republican soldiers with a heroism and intrepidity\nwhich never failed them, and which no reverse could shake\nWhen the Convention gave place to the Directory they had\nliberated the country, and had carried a war of invasion into the\nenemy's territory.  At this period the soldiers were the only\ntrue Republicans left in France.\n\nFaith is contagious, and the Revolution was regarded as a new\nera, so that several of the nations invaded, oppressed by the\nabsolutism of their monarchs, welcomed the invaders as\nliberators.  The inhabitants of Savoy ran out to meet the troops.\n\nAt Mayence the crowd welcomed them with enthusiasm planted trees\nof liberty, and formed a Convention in imitation of that of\nParis.\n\nSo long as the armies of the Revolution had to deal with peoples\nbent under the yoke of absolute monarchy, and having no personal\nideal to defend, their success was relatively easy.  But when\nthey entered into conflict with peoples who had an ideal as\nstrong as their own victory became far more difficult.\n\nThe new ideal of liberty and equality was capable of seducing\npeoples who had no precise convictions, and were suffering from\nthe despotism of their masters, but it was naturally powerless\nagainst those who possessed a potent ideal of their own which had\nbeen long established in their minds.  For this reason Bretons\nand Vendeeans, whose religious and monarchical sentiments were\nextremely powerful, successfully struggled for years against the\narmies of the Republic.\n\nIn March, 1793, the insurrections of the Vendee and Brittany\nhad spread to ten departments.  The Vendeeans in Poitou\nand the Chouans in Brittany put 80,000 men in the field.\n\nThe conflicts between contrary ideals--that is, between beliefs\nin which reason can play no part--are always pitiless, and the\nstruggle with the Vendee immediately assumed the ferocious\nsavagery always observable in religious wars.  It lasted until\nthe end of 1795, when Hoche finally ``pacified'' the country.\nThis pacification was the simple result of the practical\nextermination of its defenders.\n\n``After two years of civil war,'' writes Molinari, ``the\nVendee was no more than a hideous heap of ruins.  About\n900,000 individuals--men, women, children, and aged people--had\nperished, and the small number of those who had escaped massacre\ncould scarcely find food or shelter.  The fields were devastated,\nthe hedges and walls destroyed, and the houses burned.''\n\nBesides their faith, which so often rendered them invincible, the\nsoldiers of the Revolution had usually the advantage of being led\nby remarkable generals, full of ardour and formed on the battle-\nfield.\n\nThe majority of the former leaders of the army, being nobles, had\nemigrated so that a new body of officers had to be organised.\nThe result was that those gifted with innate military aptitudes\nhad a chance of showing them, and passed through all the grades\nof rank in a few months.  Hoche, for instance, a corporal in\n1789, was a general of division and commander of an army at the\nage of twenty-five.  The extreme youth of these leaders resulted\nin a spirit of aggression to which the armies opposed to them\nwere not accustomed.  Selected only according to merit,\nand hampered by no traditions, no routine, they quickly succeeded\nin working out a tactics suited to the new necessities.\n\nOf soldiers without experience opposed to seasoned professional\ntroops, drilled and trained according to the methods in use\neverywhere since the Seven Years' War, one could not expect\ncomplicated manoeuvres.\n\nAttacks were delivered simply by great masses of troops.  Thanks\nto the numbers of the men at the disposal of their generals, the\nconsiderable gaps provoked by this efficacious but barbarous\nprocedure could be rapidly filled.\n\nDeep masses of men attacked the enemy with the bayonet, and\nquickly routed men accustomed to methods which were more careful\nof the lives of soldiers.  The slow rate of fire in those days\nrendered the French tactics relatively easy of employment.  It\ntriumphed, but at the cost of enormous losses.  It has been\ncalculated that between 1792 and 1800 the French army left more\nthan a third of its effective force on the battle-field (700,000\nmen out of 2,000,000).\n\nExamining events from a psychological point of view, we shall\ncontinue to elicit the consequences from the facts on which they\nare consequent.\n\nA study of the revolutionary crowds in Paris and in the armies\npresents very different but readily interpreted pictures.\n\nWe have proved that crowds, unable to reason, obey simply their\nimpulses, which are always changing, but we have also seen that\nthey are readily capable of heroism, that their altruism is often\nhighly developed, and that it is easy to find thousands of\nmen ready to give their lives for a belief.\n\nPsychological characteristics so diverse must naturally,\naccording to the circumstances, lead to dissimilar and even\nabsolutely contradictory actions.  The history of the Convention\nand its armies proves as much.  It shows us crowds composed of\nsimilar elements acting so differently in Paris and on the\nfrontiers that one can hardly believe the same people can be in\nquestion.\n\nIn Paris the crowds were disorderly, violent, murderous, and so\nchangeable in their demands as to make all government impossible.\n\nIn the armies the picture was entirely different.  The same\nmultitudes of unaccustomed men, restrained by the orderly\nelements of a laborious peasant population, standardised by\nmilitary discipline, and inspired by contagious enthusiasm,\nheroically supported privations, disdained perils, and\ncontributed to form that fabulous strain which triumphed over the\nmost redoubtable troops in Europe.\n\nThese facts are among those which should always be invoked to\nshow the force of discipline.  It transforms men.  Liberated from\nits influence, peoples and armies become barbarian hordes.\n\nThis truth is daily and increasingly forgotten.  Ignoring the\nfundamental laws of collective logic, we give way more and more\nto shifting popular impulses, instead of learning to direct them.\n\nThe multitude must be shown the road to follow; it is not for\nthem to choose it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nPSYCHOLOGY OF THE LEADERS OF THE REVOLUTION\n\n\n1.  Mentality of the Men of the Revolution.  The respective\nInfluence of Violent and Feeble Characters.\n\nMen judge with their intelligence, and are guided by their\ncharacters.  To understand a man fully one must separate these\ntwo elements.\n\nDuring the great periods of activity--and the revolutionary\nmovements naturally belong to such periods--character always\ntakes the first rank.\n\nHaving in several chapters described the various mentalities\nwhich predominate in times of disturbance, we need not return to\nthe subject now.  They constitute general types which are\nnaturally modified by each man's inherited and acquired\npersonality.\n\nWe have seen what an important part was played by the mystic\nelement in the Jacobin mentality, and the ferocious fanaticism to\nwhich it led the sectaries of the new faith.\n\nWe have also seen that all the members of the Assemblies were not\nfanatics.  These latter were even in the minority, since in the\nmost sanguinary of the revolutionary assemblies the great\nmajority was composed of timid and moderate men of neutral\ncharacter.  Before Thermidor the members of this group\nvoted from fear with the violent and after Thermidor with the\nmoderate deputies.\n\nIn time of revolution, as at other times, these neutral\ncharacters, obeying the most contrary impulses, are always the\nmost numerous.  They are also as dangerous in reality as the\nviolent characters.  The force of the latter is supported by the\nweakness of the former.\n\nIn all revolutions, and in particularly in the French Revolution,\nwe observe a small minority of narrow but decided minds which\nimperiously dominate an immense majority of men who are often\nvery intelligent but are lacking in character\n\nBesides the fanatical apostles and the feeble characters, a\nrevolution always produces individuals who merely think how to\nprofit thereby.  These were numerous during the French\nRevolution.  Their aim was simply to utilise circumstances so as\nto enrich themselves.  Such were Barras, Tallien, Fouche,\nBarrere, and many more.  Their politics consisted simply in\nserving the strong against the weak.\n\nFrom the outset of the Revolution these ``arrivists,'' as one\nwould call them to-day, were numerous.  Camille Desmoulins wrote\nin 1792:  ``Our Revolution has its roots only in the egotism and\nself-love of each individual, of the combination of which the\ngeneral interest is composed.''\n\nIf we add to these indications the observations contained in\nanother chapter concerning the various forms of mentality to be\nobserved in times of political upheaval, we shall obtain a\ngeneral idea of the character of the men of the Revolution.  We\nshall now apply the principles already expounded to the\nmost remarkable personages of the revolutionary period.\n\n\n2.  Psychology of the Commissaries or Representatives ``on\nMission.''\n\n\nIn Paris the conduct of the members of the Convention was always\ndirected, restrained, or excited by the action of their\ncolleagues, and that of their environment.\n\nTo judge them properly we should observe them when left to\nthemselves and uncontrolled, when they possessed full liberty.\nSuch were the representatives who were sent ``on mission'' into\nthe departments by the Convention.\n\nThe power of these delegates was absolute.  No censure\nembarrassed them.  Functionaries and magistrates had perforce to\nobey them.\n\nA representative ``on mission'' ``requisitions,'' sequestrates,\nor confiscates as seems good to him; taxes, imprisons, deports,\nor decapitates as he thinks fit, and in his own district he is a\n''pasha.''\n\nRegarding themselves as ``pashas,'' they displayed themselves\n``drawn in carriages with six horses, surrounded by guards;\nsitting at sumptuous tables with thirty covers, eating to the\nsound of music, with a following of players, courtezans, and\nmercenaries. . . .''  At Lyons ``the solemn appearance of Collot\nd'Herbois is like that of the Grand Turk.  No one can come into\nhis presence without three repeated requests; a string of\napartments precedes his reception-room, and no one approaches\nnearer than fifteen paces.''\n\nOne can picture the immense vanity of these dictators as\nthey solemnly entered the towns, surrounded by guards, men whose\ngesture was enough to cause heads to fall.\n\nPetty lawyers without clients, doctors without patients,\nunfrocked clergymen, obscure attorneys, who had formerly known\nthe most colourless of lives, were suddenly made the equals of\nthe most powerful tyrants of history.  Guillotining, drowning,\nshooting without mercy, at the hazard of their fancy, they were\nraised from their former humble condition to the level of the\nmost celebrated potentates.\n\nNever did Nero or Heliogabalus surpass in tyranny the\nrepresentatives of the Convention.  Laws and customs always\nrestrained the former to a certain extent.  Nothing restrained\nthe commissaries.\n\n``Fouche,'' writes Taine, ``lorgnette in hand, watched the\nbutchery of 210 inhabitants of Lyons from his window.  Collot,\nLaporte, and Fouche feasted on days of execution (fusillades),\nand at the sound of each discharge sprang up with cries of joy,\nwaving their hats.''\n\nAmong the representatives ``on mission'' who exhibit this\nmurderous mentality we may cite as a type the ex-cure Lebon,\nwho, having become possessed of supreme power, ravaged Arras and\nCambrai.  His example, with that of Carrier, contributes to show\nwhat man can become when he escapes from the yoke of law and\ntradition.  The cruelty of the ferocious commissary was\ncomplicated by Sadism; the scaffold was raised under his windows,\nso that he, his wife, and his helpers could rejoice in the\ncarnage.  At the foot of the guillotine a drinking-booth was\nestablished where the sans-culottes could come to drink.\nTo amuse them the executioner would group on the pavement, in\nridiculous attitudes, the naked bodies of the decapitated.\n\n``The reading of the two volumes of his trial, printed at Amiens\nin 1795, may be counted as a nightmare.  During twenty sessions\nthe survivors of the hecatombs of Arras and Cambrai passed\nthrough the ancient hall of the bailiwick at Amiens, where the\nex-member of the Convention was tried.  What these phantoms in\nmourning related is unheard of.  Entire streets dispeopled;\nnonagenarians and girls of sixteen decapitated after a mockery of\na trial; death buffeted, insulted, adorned, rejoiced in;\nexecutions to music; battalions of children recruited to guard\nthe scaffold; the debauchery, the cynicism, the refinements of an\ninsane satrap; a romance by Sade turned epic; it seems, as we\nwatch the unpacking of these horrors, that a whole country, long\nterrorised, is at last disgorging its terror and revenging itself\nfor its cowardice by overwhelming the wretch there, the scapegoat\nof an abhorred and vanished system.''\n\nThe only defence of the ex-clergyman was that he had obeyed\norders.  The facts with which he was reproached had long been\nknown, and the Convention had in no wise blamed him for them.\n\nI have already spoken of the vanity of the deputies ``on\nmission,'' who were suddenly endowed with a power greater than\nthat of the most powerful despots; but this vanity is not enough\nto explain their ferocity.\n\nThat arose from other sources.  Apostles of a severe faith, the\ndelegates of the Convention, like the inquisitors of the Holy\nOffice, could feel, can have felt, no pity for their victims.\nFreed, moreover, from all the bonds of tradition and law,\nthey could give rein to the most savage instincts that primitive\nanimality has left in us.\n\nCivilisation restrains these instincts, but they never die.  The\nneed to kill which makes the hunter is a permanent proof of this.\n\nM. Cunisset-Carnot has expressed in the following lines the grip\nof this hereditary tendency, which, in the pursuit of the most\nharmless game, re-awakens the barbarian in every hunter:--\n\n``The pleasure of killing for killing's sake is, one may say,\nuniversal; it is the basis of the hunting instinct, for it must\nbe admitted that at present, in civilised countries, the need to\nlive no longer counts for anything in its propagation.  In\nreality we are continuing an action which was imperiously imposed\nupon our savage ancestors by the harsh necessities of existence,\nduring which they had either to kill or die of hunger, while to-\nday there is no longer any legitimate excuse for it.  But so it\nis, and we can do nothing; probably we shall never break the\nchains of a slavery which has bound us for so long.  We cannot\nprevent ourselves from feeling an intense, often passionate,\npleasure in shedding the blood of animals towards whom, when the\nlove of the chase possesses us, we lose all feeling of pity.  The\ngentlest and prettiest creatures, the song-birds, the charm of\nour springtime, fall to our guns or are choked in our snares, and\nnot a shudder of pity troubles our pleasure at seeing them\nterrified, bleeding, writhing in the horrible suffering we\ninflict on them, seeking to flee on their poor broken paws or\ndesperately beating their wings, which can no longer support\nthem. . . .  The excuse is the impulse of that imperious\natavism which the best of us have not the strength to resist.''\n\nAt ordinary times this singular atavism, restrained by fear of\nthe laws, can only be exercised on animals.  When codes are no\nlonger operative it immediately applies itself to man, which is\nwhy so many terrorists took an intense pleasure in killing.\nCarrier's remark concerning the joy he felt in contemplating the\nfaces of his victims during their torment is very typical.  In\nmany civilised men ferocity is a restrained instinct, but it is\nby no means eliminated.\n\n\n3.  Danton and Robespierre.\n\n\nDanton and Robespierre represented the two principal personages\nof the Revolution.  I shall say little of the former: his\npsychology, besides being simple, is familiar.  A club orator\nfirstly, impulsive and violent, he showed himself always ready to\nexcite the people.  Cruel only in his speeches, he often\nregretted their effects.  From the outset he shone in the first\nrank, while his future rival, Robespierre, was vegetating almost\nin the lowest.\n\nAt one given moment Danton became the soul of the Revolution, but\nhe was deficient in tenacity and fixity of conduct.  Moreover, he\nwas needy, while Robespierre was not.  The continuous fanaticism\nof the latter defeated the intermittent efforts of the former.\nNevertheless, it was an amazing spectacle to see so powerful a\ntribune sent to the scaffold by his pale, venemous enemy and\nmediocre rival.\n\nRobespierre, the most influential man of the Revolution and the\nmost frequently studied, is yet the least explicable.  It is\ndifficult to understand the prodigious influence which\ngave him the power of life and death, not only over the enemies\nof the Revolution but also over colleagues who could not have\nbeen considered as enemies of the existing Government.\n\nWe certainly cannot explain the matter by saying with Taine that\nRobespierre was a pedant lost in abstractions, nor by asserting\nwith the Michelet that he succeeded on account of his principles,\nnor by repeating with his contemporary Williams that ``one of the\nsecrets of his government was to take men marked by opprobrium or\nsoiled with crime as stepping-stones to his ambition.''\n\nIt is impossible to regard his eloquence as the cause of his\nsuccess.  His eyes protected by goggles, he painfully read his\nspeeches, which were composed of cold and indefinite\nabstractions.  The Assembly contained orators who possessed an\nimmensely superior talent, such as Danton and the Girondists; yet\nit was Robespierre who destroyed them.\n\nWe have really no acceptable explanation of the ascendancy which\nthe dictator finally obtained.  Without influence in the National\nAssembly, he gradually became the master of the Convention and of\nthe Jacobins.  ``When he reached the Committee of Public Safety\nhe was already,'' said Billaud-Varennes, ``the most important\nperson in France.''\n\n``His history,'' writes Michelet, ``is prodigious, far more\nmarvellous than that of Bonaparte.  The threads, the wheels, the\npreparation of forces, are far less visible.  It is an honest\nman, an austere but pious figure, of middling talents, that\nshoots up one morning, borne upward by I know not what cataclysm.\nThere is nothing like it in the Arabian Nights.  And in a moment\nhe goes higher than the throne.  He is set upon the altar.\nAstonishing story!''\n\nCertainly circumstances helped him considerably.  People turned\nto him as to the master of whom all felt the need.  But then he\nwas already there, and what we wish to discover is the cause of\nhis rapid ascent.  I would willingly suppose in him the existence\nof a species of personal fascination which escapes us to-day.\nHis successes with women might be quoted in support of this\ntheory.  On the days when he speaks ``the passages are choked\nwith women . . . there are seven or eight hundred in the\ntribunes, and with what transports they applaud!  At the\nJacobins, when he speaks there are sobs and cries of emotion, and\nmen stamp as though they would bring the hall down.''  A young\nwidow, Mme. de Chalabre, possessed of sixteen hundred pounds a\nyear, sends him burning love-letters and is eager to marry him.\n\nWe cannot seek in his character for the causes of his popularity.\nA hypochondriac by temperament, of mediocre intelligence,\nincapable of grasping realities, confined to abstractions, crafty\nand dissimulating, his prevailing note was an excessive pride\nwhich increased until his last day.  High priest of a new faith,\nhe believed himself sent on earth by God to establish the\nreign of virtue.  He received writings stating ``that he\nwas the Messiah whom the Eternal Being had promised to reform\nthe world.''\n\nFull of literary pretensions, he laboriously polished his\nspeeches.  His profound jealousy of other orators or men of\nletters, such as Camille Desmoulins, caused their death.\n\n``Those who were particularly the objects of the tyrant's rage,''\nwrites the author already cited, ``were the men of letters.  With\nregard to them the jealousy of a colleague was mingled with the\nfury of the oppressor; for the hatred with which he persecuted\nthem was caused less by their resistance to his despotism than by\ntheir talents, which eclipsed his.''\n\nThe contempt of the dictator for his colleagues was immense and\nalmost unconcealed.  Giving audience to Barras at the hour of his\ntoilet, he finished shaving, spitting in the direction of his\ncolleague as though he did not exist, and disdaining to reply to\nhis questions.\n\nHe regarded the bourgeoisie and the deputies with the same\nhateful disdain.  Only the multitude found grace in his eyes.\n``When the sovereign people exercises its power,'' he said, ``we\ncan only bow before it.  In all it does all is virtue and truth,\nand no excess, error, or crime is possible.''\n\nRobespierre suffered from the persecution mania.  That he had\nothers' heads cut off was not only because he had a mission as an\napostle, but because he believed himself hemmed in by enemies and\nconspirators.  ``Great as was the cowardice of his colleagues\nwhere he was concerned,'' writes M. Sorel, ``the fear he had of\nthem was still greater.''\n\nHis dictatorship, absolute during five months, is a striking\nexample of the power of certain leaders.  We can understand that\na tyrant backed by an army can easily destroy whom he pleases,\nbut that a single man should succeed in sending to death a large\nnumber of his equals is a thing that is not easily explained.\n\nThe power of Robespierre was so absolute that he was able to send\nto the Tribunal, and therefore to the scaffold, the most eminent\ndeputies: Desmoulins, Hebert, Danton, and many another.  The\nbrilliant Girondists melted away before him.  He attacked even\nthe terrible Commune, guillotined its leaders, and replaced it by\na new Commune obedient to his orders.\n\nIn order to rid himself more quickly of the men who displeased\nhim he induced the Convention to enact the law of Prairial, which\npermitted the execution of mere suspects, and by means of which\nhe had 1,373 heads cut off in Paris in forty-nine days.  His\ncolleagues, the victims of an insane terror, no longer slept at\nhome; scarcely a hundred deputies were present at sessions.\nDavid said:  ``I do not believe twenty of us members of the\nMountain will be left.''\n\nIt was his very excess of confidence in his own powers and in the\ncowardice of the Convention that lost Robespierre his life.\nHaving attempted to make them vote a measure which would permit\ndeputies to be sent before the Revolutionary Tribunal, which\nmeant the scaffold, without the authorisation of the Assembly, on\nan order from the governing Committee, several Montagnards\nconspired with some members of the Plain to overthrow him.\nTallien, knowing himself marked down for early execution, and\nhaving therefore nothing to lose, accused him loudly of tyranny.\nRobespierre wished to defend himself by reading a speech which he\nhad long had in hand, but he learned to his cost that although it\nis possible to destroy men in the name of logic it is not\npossible to lead an assembly by means of logic.  The\nshouts of the conspirators drowned his voice; the cry ``Down with\nthe tyrant!'' quickly repeated, thanks to mental contagion, by\nmany of the members present, was enough to complete his downfall.\nWithout losing a moment the Assembly decreed his accusation.\n\nThe Commune having wished to save him, the Assembly outlawed him.\nStruck by this magic formula, he was definitely lost.\n\n``This cry of outlawry,'' writes Williams, ``at this period\nproduced the same effect on a Frenchman as the cry of pestilence;\nthe outlaw became civilly excommunicated, and it was as though\nmen believed that they would be contaminated passing through the\nair which he had breathed.  Such was the effect it produced upon\nthe gunners who had trained their cannon against the Convention.\nWithout receiving further orders, merely on hearing that the\nCommune was `outside the law,' they immediately turned their\nbatteries about.''\n\nRobespierre and all his band--Saint-Just, the president of the\nRevolutionary Tribunal, the mayor of the Commune, &c.,--were\nguillotined on the 10th of Thermidor to the number of twenty-one.\n\nTheir execution was followed on the morrow by a fresh batch of\nseventy Jacobins, and on the next day by thirteen.  The Terror,\nwhich had lasted ten months, was at an end.\n\nThe downfall of the Jacobin edifice in Thermidor is one of the\nmost curious psychological events of the revolutionary period.\nNone of the Montagnards who had worked for the downfall of\nRobespierre had for a moment dreamed that it would mark the end\nof the Terror.\n\nTallien, Barras, Fouche, &c., overthrew Robespierre as he had\noverthrown Hebert, Danton, the Girondists, and many others.\nBut when the acclamations of the crowd told them that the death\nof Robespierre was regarded as having put an end to the Terror\nthey acted as though such had been their intention.  They were\nthe more obliged to do so in that the Plain--that is, the great\nmajority of the Assembly--which had allowed itself to be\ndecimated by Robespierre, now rebelled furiously against the\nsystem it had so long acclaimed even while it abhorred it.\nNothing is more terrible than a body of men who have been afraid\nand are afraid no longer.  The Plain revenged itself for being\nterrorised by the Mountain, and terrorised that body in turn.\n\nThe servility of the colleagues of Robespierre in the Convention\nwas by no means based upon any feeling of sympathy for him.  The\ndictator filled them with an unspeakable alarm, but beneath the\nmarks of admiration and enthusiasm which they lavished on him out\nof fear was concealed an intense hatred.  We can gather as much\nby reading the reports of various deputies inserted in the\nMoniteur of August 11, 15, and 29, 1794, and notably that on\n``the conspiracy of the triumvirs, Robespierre, Couthon, and\nSaint-Just.''  Never did slaves heap such invectives on a fallen\nmaster.\n\nWe learn that ``these monsters had for some time been renewing\nthe most horrible prescriptions of Marius and Sulla.''\nRobespierre is represented as a most frightful scoundrel; we are\nassured that ``like Caligula, he would soon have asked the French\npeople to worship his horse . . .  He sought security in\nthe execution of all who aroused his slightest suspicion.''\n\nThese reports forget to add that the power of Robespierre\nobtained no support, as did that of the Marius and Sulla to whom\nthey allude, from a powerful army, but merely from the repeated\nadhesion of the members of the Convention.  Without their\nextreme timidity the power of the dictator could not have lasted\na single day.\n\nRobespierre was one of the most odious tyrants of history, but he\nis distinguished from all others in that he made himself a tyrant\nwithout soldiers.\n\nWe may sum up his doctrines by saying that he was the most\nperfect incarnation, save perhaps Saint-Just, of the Jacobin\nfaith, in all its narrow logic, its intense mysticism, and its\ninflexible rigidity.  He has admirers even to-day.  M. Hamel\ndescribes him as ``the martyr of Thermidor.''  There has been\nsome talk of erecting a monument to him.  I would willingly\nsubscribe to such a purpose, feeling that it is useful to\npreserve proofs of the blindness of the crowd, and of the\nextraordinary docility of which an assembly is capable when the\nleader knows how to handle it.  His statue would recall the\npassionate cries of admiration and enthusiasm with which the\nConvention acclaimed the most threatening measures of the\ndictator, on the very eve of the day when it was about to cast\nhim down.\n\n\n4.  Fouquier-Tinville, Marat, Billaud-Varenne, &c.\n\n\nI shall devote a paragraph to certain revolutionists who were\nfamous for the development of their most sanguinary instincts.\nTheir ferocity was complicated by other sentiments, by\nfear and hatred, which could but fortify it.\n\nFouquier-Tinville, the public prosecutor of the Revolutionary\nTribunal, was one of those who have left the most sinister\nmemories.  This magistrate, formerly reputed for his kindness,\nand who became the bloodthirsty creature whose memory evokes such\nrepulsion, has already served me as an example in other works,\nwhen I have wished to show the transformation of certain natures\nin time of revolution.\n\nNeedy in the extreme at the moment of the fall of the monarchy,\nhe had everything to hope from a social upheaval and nothing to\nlose.  He was one of those men whom a period of disorder will\nalways find ready to sustain it.\n\nThe Convention abandoned its powers to him.  He had to pronounce\nupon the fate of nearly two thousand accused, among whom were\nMarie-Antoinette, the Girondists, Danton, Hebert, &c.  He had\nall the suspects brought before him executed, and did not scruple\nto betray his former protectors.  As soon as one of them fell\ninto his power--Camille Desmoulins, Danton, or another--he would\nplead against him.\n\nFouquier-Tinville had a very inferior mind, which the Revolution\nbrought to the top.  Under normal conditions, hedged about by\nprofessional rules, his destiny would have been that of a\npeaceable and obscure magistrate.  This was precisely the lot of\nhis deputy, or substitute, at the Tribunal, Gilbert-Liendon.\n``He should,'' writes M. Durel, ``have inspired the same horror\nas his colleague, yet he completed his career in the upper ranks\nof the Imperial magistracy.''\n\nOne of the great benefits of an organised society is that it does\nrestrain these dangerous characters, whom nothing but social\nrestraints can hold.\n\nFouquier-Tinville died without understanding why he was\ncondemned, and from the revolutionary point of view his\ncondemnation was not justifiable.  Had he not merely zealously\nexecuted the orders of his superiors?  It is impossible to class\nhim with the representatives who were sent into the provinces,\nwho could not be supervised.  The delegates of the Convention\nexamined all his sentences and approved of them up to the last.\nIf his cruelty and his summary fashion of trying the prisoners\nbefore him had not been encouraged by his chiefs, he could not\nhave remained in power.  In condemning Fouquier-Tinville, the\nConvention condemned its own frightful system of government.  It\nunderstood this fact, and sent to the scaffold a number of\nTerrorists whom Fouquier-Tinville had merely served as a faithful\nagent.\n\nBeside Fouquier-Tinville we may set Dumas, who presided over the\nRevolutionary Tribunal, and who also displayed an excessive\ncruelty, which was whetted by an intense fear.  He never went out\nwithout two loaded pistols, barricaded himself in his house, and\nonly spoke to visitors through a wicket.  His distrust of\neverybody, including his own wife, was absolute.  He even\nimprisoned the latter, and was about to have her executed when\nThermidor arrived.\n\nAmong the men whom the Convention brought to light, Billaud-\nVarenne was one of the wildest and, most brutal.  He may be\nregarded as a perfect type of bestial ferocity.\n\n``In these hours of fruitful anger and heroic anguish he\nremained calm, acquitting himself methodically of his task--and\nit was a frightful task: he appeared officially at the massacres\nof the Abbaye, congratulated the assassins, and promised them\nmoney; upon which he went home as if he had merely been taking a\nwalk.  We see him as president of the Jacobin Club, president of\nthe Convention, and member of the Committee of Public Safety; he\ndrags the Girondists to the scaffold: he drags the queen thither,\nand his former patron, Danton, said of him, `Billaud has a dagger\nunder his tongue.'  He approves of the cannonades at Lyons, the\ndrownings at Nantes, the massacres at Arras; he organises the\npitiless commission of Orange; he is concerned in the laws of\nPrairial; he eggs on Fouquier-Tinville; on all decrees of death\nis his name, often the first; he signs before his colleagues; he\nis without pity, without emotion, without enthusiasm; when others\nare frightened, hesitate, and draw back, he goes his way,\nspeaking in turgid sentences, `shaking his lion's mane'--for to\nmake his cold and impassive face more in harmony with the\nexuberance that surrounds him he now decks himself in a yellow\nwig which would make one laugh were it on any but the sinister\nhead of Billaud-Varenne.  When Robespierre, Saint-Just, and\nCouthon are threatened in turn, he deserts them and goes over to\nthe enemy, and pushes them under the knife. . . .  Why?  What is\nhis aim?  No one knows; he is not in any way ambitious; he\ndesires neither power nor money.''\n\nI do not think it would be difficult to answer why.  The thirst\nfor blood, of which we have already spoken, and which is very\ncommon among certain criminals, perfectly explains the\nconduct of Billaud-Varennes.  Bandits of this type kill for the\nsake of killing, as sportsmen shoot game--for the very pleasure\nof exercising their taste for destruction.  In ordinary times men\nendowed with these homicidal tendencies refrain, generally from\nfear of the policeman and the scaffold.  When they are able to\ngive them free vent nothing can stop them.  Such was the case\nwith Billaud-Varenne and many others.\n\nThe psychology of Marat is rather more complicated, not only\nbecause his craving for murder was combined with other elements--\nwounded self-love, ambition, mystic beliefs, &c.--but also\nbecause we must regard him as a semi-lunatic, affected by\nmegalomania, and haunted by fixed ideas.\n\nBefore the Revolution he had advanced great scientific\npretensions, but no one attached much importance to his\nmaunderings.  Dreaming of place and honour, he had only obtained\na very subordinate situation in the household of a great noble.\nThe Revolution opened up an unhoped-for future.  Swollen with\nhatred of the old social system which had not recognised his\nmerits, he put himself at the head of the most violent section of\nthe people.  Having publicly glorified the massacres of\nSeptember, he founded a journal which denounced everybody and\nclamoured incessantly for executions.\n\nSpeaking continually of the interests of the people, Marat became\ntheir idol.  The majority of his colleagues heartily despised\nhim.  Had he escaped the knife of Charlotte Corday, he certainly\nwould not have escaped that of the guillotine.\n\n\n5.  The Destiny of those Members of the Convention who survived\nthe Revolution.\n\n\nBeside the members of the Convention whose psychology presents\nparticular characteristics there were others--Barras, Fouche,\nTallien, Merlin de Thionville, &c.--completely devoid of\nprinciples or belief, who only sought to enrich themselves.\n\nThey sought to build up enormous fortunes out of the public\nmisery.  In ordinary times they would have been qualified as\nsimple scoundrels, but in periods of revolution all standards\nof vice and virtue seem to disappear.\n\nAlthough a few Jacobins remained fanatics, the majority renounced\ntheir convictions as soon as they had obtained riches, and became\nthe faithful courtiers of Napoleon.  Cambaceres, who, on\naddressing Louis XVI. in prison, called him Louis Capet, under\nthe Empire required his friends to call him ``Highness'' in\npublic and ``Monseigneur'' in private, thus displaying the\nenvious feeling which accompanied the craving for equality in\nmany of the Jacobins.\n\n``The majority of the Jacobins,'' writes M. Madelin ``were\ngreatly enriched, and like Chabot, Bazire, Merlin, Barras,\nBoursault, Tallien, Barrere, &c., possessed chateaux and\nestates.  Those who were not wealthy as yet were soon to become\nso. . .  In the Committee of the year III. alone the staff of the\nThermidorian party comprised a future prince, 13 future counts, 5\nfuture barons, 7 future senators of the Empire, and 6 future\nCouncillors of State, and beside them in the Convention there\nwere, between the future Duke of Otranto to the future Count\nRegnault, no less than 50 democrats who fifteen years\nlater possessed titles, coats of arms, plumes, carriages,\nendowments, entailed estates, hotels, and chateaux.\nFouche died worth L600,000.''\n\nThe privileges of the ancien regime which had been so\nbitterly decried were thus very soon re-established for the\nbenefit of the bourgeoisie.  To arrive at this result it was\nnecessary to ruin France, to burn entire provinces, to multiply\nsuffering, to plunge innumerable families into despair, to\noverturn Europe, and to destroy men by the hundred thousand on\nthe field of battle.\n\nIn closing this chapter we will recall what we have already said\nconcerning the possibility of judging the men of this period.\n\nAlthough the moralist is forced to deal severely with certain\nindividuals, because he judges them by the types which society\nmust respect if it is to succeed in maintaining itself, the\npsychologist is not in the same case.  His aim is to understand,\nand criticism vanishes before a complete comprehension.\n\nThe human mind is a very fragile mechanism, and the marionettes\nwhich dance upon the stage of history are rarely able to resist\nthe imperious forces which impel them.  Heredity, environment,\nand circumstances are imperious masters.  No one can say with\ncertainty what would have been his conduct in the place of the\nmen whose actions he endeavours to interpret.\n\n\n\nBOOK III\n\nTHE CONFLICT BETWEEN ANCESTRAL INFLUENCES AND REVOLUTIONARY\nPRINCIPLES\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE LAST CONVULSIONS OF ANARCHY--THE DIRECTORY\n\n1.  The Psychology of the Directory.\n\nAs the various revolutionary assemblies were composed in part of\nthe same men, one might suppose that their psychology would be\nvery similar.\n\nAt ordinary periods this would have been so, for a constant\nenvironment means constancy of character.  But when circumstances\nchange as rapidly as they did under the Revolution, character\nmust perforce transform itself to adapt itself thereto.  Such was\nthe case with the Directory.\n\nThe Directory comprised several distinct assemblies: two large\nchambers, consisting of different categories of deputies, and one\nvery small chamber, which consisted of the five Directors.\n\nThe two larger Assemblies remind one strongly of the Convention\nby their weakness.  They were no longer forced to obey popular\nriots, as these were energetically prevented by the Directors,\nbut they yielded without discussion to the dictatorial\ninjunctions of the latter.\n\nThe first deputies to be elected were mostly moderates.  Everyone\nwas weary of the Jacobin tyranny.  The new Assembly dreamed of\nrebuilding the ruins with which France was covered, and\nestablishing a liberal government without violence.\n\nBut by one of those fatalities which were a law of the\nRevolution, and which prove that the course of events is often\nsuperior to men's wills, these deputies, like their predecessors,\nmay be said always to have done the contrary of what they wished\nto do.  They hoped to be moderate, and they were violent; they\nwanted to eliminate the influence of the Jacobins, and they\nallowed themselves to be led by them; they thought to repair the\nruins of the country and they succeeded only in adding others to\nthem; they aspired to religious peace, and they finally\npersecuted and massacred the priests with greater rigour than\nduring the Terror.\n\nThe psychology of the little assembly formed by the five\nDirectors was very different from that of the Chamber of\nDeputies.  Encountering fresh difficulties daily, the directors\nwere forced to resolve them, while the large Assemblies, without\ncontact with realities, had only their aspirations.\n\nThe prevailing thought of the Directors was very simple.  Highly\nindifferent to principles, they wished above all to remain the\nmasters of France.  To attain that result they did not shrink\nfrom resorting to the most illegitimate measures, even annulling\nthe elections of a great number of the departments when these\nembarrassed them.\n\nFeeling themselves incapable of reorganising France, they left\nher to herself.  By their despotism they contrived to dominate\nher, but they never governed her.  Now, what France needed more\nthan anything at this juncture was to be governed.\n\nThe convention has left behind it the reputation of a strong\nGovernment, and the Directory that of a weak Government.  The\ncontrary is true: it was the Directory that was the strong\nGovernment.\n\nPsychologically we may readily explain the difference between the\nGovernment of the Directory and that of the preceding Assemblies\nby recalling the fact that a gathering of six hundred to seven\nhundred persons may well suffer from waves of contagious\nenthusiasm, as on the night of the 4th of August, or even\nimpulses of energetic will-power, such as that which launched\ndefiance against the kings of Europe.  But such impulses are too\nephemeral to possess any great force.  A committee of five\nmembers, easily dominated by the will of one, is far more\nsusceptible of continuous resolution--that is, of perseverance in\na settled line of conduct.\n\nThe Government of the Directory proved to be always incapable of\ngoverning, but it never lacked a strong will.  Nothing\nrestraining it, neither respect for law nor consideration for the\ncitizens, nor love of the public welfare, it was able to impose\nupon France a despotism more crushing than that of any Government\nsince the beginning of the Revolution, not excepting the Terror.\n\nAlthough it utilised methods analogous to those of the\nConvention, and ruled France in the most tyrannical manner, the\nDirectory, no more than the Convention, was never the master of\nFrance.\n\nThis fact, which I have already noted, proves once more the\nimpotence of material constraint to dominate moral forces.  It\ncannot be too often repeated that the true guide of mankind is\nthe moral scaffolding erected by his ancestors.\n\nAccustomed to live in an organised society, supported by codes\nand respected traditions, we can with difficulty represent to\nourselves the condition of a nation deprived of such a basis.  As\na general thing we only see the irksome side of our environment,\ntoo readily forgetting that society can exist only on condition\nof imposing certain restraints, and that laws, manners, and\ncustom constitute a check upon the natural instincts of barbarism\nwhich never entirely perishes.\n\nThe history of the Convention and the Directory which followed it\nshows plainly to what degree disorder may overcome a nation\ndeprived of its ancient structure, and having for guide only the\nartificial combinations of an insufficient reason.\n\n\n2.  Despotic Government of the Directory.  Recrudescence of the\nTerror.\n\n\nWith the object of diverting attention, occupying the army, and\nobtaining resources by the pillage of neighbouring countries, the\nDirectors decided to resume the wars of conquest which had\nsucceeded under the Convention.\n\nThese continued during the life time of the Directory.  The\narmies won a rich booty, especially in Italy.\n\nSome of the invaded populations were so simple as to suppose that\nthese invasions were undertaken in their interest.  They were not\nlong in discovering that all military operations were\naccompanied by crushing taxes and the pillage of churches, public\ntreasuries, &c.\n\nThe final consequence of this policy of conquest was the\nformation of a new coalition against France, which lasted until\n1801.\n\nIndifferent to the state of the country and incapable of\nreorganising it, the Directors were principally concerned in\nstruggling against an incessant series of conspiracies in order\nto keep in power.\n\nThis task was enough to occupy their leisure, for the political\nparties had not disarmed.  Anarchy had reached such a point that\nall were calling for a hand powerful enough to restore order.\nEveryone felt, the Directors included, that the republican system\ncould not last much longer.\n\nSome dreamed of re-establishing royalty, others the Terrorist\nsystem, while others waited for a general.  Only the purchasers\nof the national property feared a change of Government.\n\nThe unpopularity of the Directory increased daily, and when in\nMay, 1797, the third part of the Assembly had to be renewed, the\nmajority of those elected were hostile to the system.\n\nThe Directors were not embarrassed by a little thing like that.\nThey annulled the elections in 49 departments; 154 of the new\ndeputies were invalidated and expelled, 53 condemned to\ndeportation.  Among these latter figured the most illustrious\nnames of the Revolution:  Portalis, Carnot, Tronson du Coudray,\n&c.\n\nTo intimidate the electors, military commissions condemned to\ndeath, rather at random, 160 persons, and sent to Guiana 330, of\nwhom half speedily died.  The emigres and priests who\nhad returned to France were violently expelled.  This was known\nas the coup d'etat of Fructidor.\n\nThis coup, which struck more especially at the moderates, was\nnot the only one of its kind; another quickly followed.  The\nDirectors, finding the Jacobin deputies too numerous, annulled\nthe elections of sixty of them.\n\nThe preceding facts displayed the tyrannical temper of the\nDirectors, but this appeared even more plainly in the details of\ntheir measures.  The new masters of France also proved to be as\nbloodthirsty as the most ferocious deputies of the Terror.\n\nThe guillotine was not re-established as a permanency, but\nreplaced by deportation under conditions which left the victims\nlittle chance of survival.  Sent to Rochefort in cages of iron\nbars, exposed to all the severities of the weather, they were\nthen packed into boats.\n\n``Between the decks of the Decade and the Bayonnaise,''\nsays Taine, ``the miserable prisoners, suffocated by the lack of\nair and the torrid heat, bullied and fleeced, died of hunger or\nasphyxia, and Guiana completed the work of the voyage: of 193\ntaken thither by the Decade 39 were left alive at the end of\ntwenty-two months; of 120 taken by the Bayonnaise 1 remained.\n\nObserving everywhere a Catholic renascence, and imagining that\nthe clergy were conspiring against them, the Directors deported\nor sent to the galleys in one year 1,448 priests, to say nothing\nof a large number who were summarily executed.  The Terror was in\nreality completely re-established.\n\nThe autocratic despotism of the Directory was exercised in all\nthe branches of the administration, notably the finances.  Thus,\nhaving need of six hundred million francs, it forced the\ndeputies, always docile, to vote a progressive impost, which\nyielded, however, only twelve millions.  Being presently in the\nsame condition, it decreed a forced loan of a hundred millions,\nwhich resulted in the closing of workshops, the stoppage of\nbusiness, and the dismissal of domestics.  It was only at the\nprice of absolute ruin that forty millions could be obtained.\n\nTo assure itself of domination in the provinces the Directory\ncaused a so-called law of hostages to be passed, according to\nwhich a list of hostages, responsible for all offences, was drawn\nup in each commune.\n\nIt is easy to understand what hatred such a system provoked.  At\nthe end of 1799 fourteen departments were in revolt and forty-six\nwere ready to rise.  If the Directory had lasted the dissolution\nof society would have been complete.\n\nFor that matter, this dissolution was far advanced.  Finances,\nadministration, everything was crumbling.  The receipts of the\nTreasury, consisting of depreciated assignats fallen to a\nhundredth part of their original value, were negligible.  Holders\nof Government stock and officers could no longer obtain payment.\n\nFrance at this time gave travellers the impression of a country\nravaged by war and abandoned by its inhabitants.  The broken\nbridges and dykes and ruined buildings made all traffic\nimpossible.  The roads, long deserted, were infested by brigands.\n\nCertain departments could only be crossed at the price of buying\na safe-conduct from the leaders of these bands.  Industry\nand commerce were annihilated.  In Lyons 13,000 workshops and\nmills out of 15,000 had been forced to close.  Lille, Havre,\nBordeaux, Lyons, Marseilles, &c., were like dead cities.  Poverty\nand famine were general.\n\nThe moral disorganisation was no less terrible.  Luxury and the\ncraving for pleasure, costly dinners, jewels, and extravagant\nhouseholds were the appanage of a new society composed entirely\nof stock-jobbers, army contractors, and shady financiers enriched\nby pillage.  They gave Paris that superficial aspect of luxury\nand gaiety which has deluded so many historians of this period,\nbecause the insolent prodigality displayed covered the general\nmisery.\n\nThe chronicles of the Directory as told in books help to show us\nof what lies the web of history is woven.  The theatre has lately\ngot hold of this period, of which the fashions are still\nimitated.  It has left the memory of a joyous period of re-birth\nafter the gloomy drama of the Terror.  In reality the drama of\nthe Directory was hardly an improvement on the Terror and was\nquite as sanguinary.  Finally, it inspired such loathing that the\nDirectors, feeling that it could not last, sought themselves for\nthe dictator capable of replacing it and also of protecting them.\n\n\n3.  The Advent of Bonaparte.\n\n\nWe have seen that at the end of the Directory the anarchy and\ndisorganisation were such that every one was desperately calling\nfor the man of energy capable of re-establishing order.  As early\nas 1795 a number of deputies had thought for a moment of re-\nestablishing royalty.  Louis XVIII., having been tactless\nenough to declare that he would restore the ancien regime in\nits entirety, return all property to its original owners, and\npunish the men of the Revolution, was immediately thrown over.\nThe senseless expedition of Quiberon finally alienated the\nsupporters of the future sovereign.  The royalists gave a proof\nduring the whole of the Revolution of an incapacity and a\nnarrowness of mind which justified most of the measures taken\nagainst them.\n\nThe monarchy being impossible, it was necessary to find a\ngeneral.  Only one existed whose name carried weight--Bonaparte.\nThe campaign in Italy had just made him famous.  Having crossed\nthe Alps, he had marched from victory to victory, penetrated to\nMilan and Venice, and everywhere obtained important war\ncontributions.  He then made towards Vienna, and was only twenty-\nfive leagues from its gates when the Emperor of Austria decided\nto sue for peace.\n\nBut great as was his renown, the young general did not consider\nit sufficient.  To increase it he persuaded the Directory that\nthe power of England could be shaken by an invasion of Egypt, and\nin May, 1798, he embarked at Toulon.\n\nThis need of increasing his prestige arose from a very sound\npsychological conception which he clearly expounded at St.\nHelena:--\n\n``The most influential and enlightened generals had long been\npressing the general of Italy to take steps to place himself at\nthe head of the Republic.  He refused; he was not yet strong\nenough to walk quite alone.  He had ideas upon the art of\ngoverning and upon what was necessary to a great nation\nwhich were so different from those of the men of the\nRevolution and the assemblies that, not being able to act alone,\nhe feared to compromise his character.  He determined to set out\nfor Egypt, but resolved to reappear if circumstances should arise\nto render his presence useful or necessary.''\n\nBonaparte did not stay long in Egypt.  Recalled by his friends,\nhe landed at Frejus, and the announcement of his return provoked\nuniversal enthusiasm.  There were illuminations everywhere.\nFrance collaborated in advance in the coup d'etat prepared\nby two Directors and the principal ministers.  The plot was\norganised in three weeks.  Its execution on the 18th of Brumaire\nwas accomplished with the greatest ease.\n\nAll parties experienced the greatest delight at being rid of the\nsinister gangs who had so long oppressed and exploited the\ncountry.  The French were doubtless about to enter upon a\ndespotic system of government, but it could not be so intolerable\nas that which had been endured for so many years.\n\nThe history of the coup d'etat of Brumaire justifies all\nthat we have already said of the impossibility of forming exact\njudgments of events which apparently are fully understood and\nattested by no matter how many witnesses.\n\nWe know what ideas people had thirty years ago concerning the\ncoup of Brumaire.  It was regarded as a crime committed by the\nambition of a man who was supported by his army.  As a matter of\nfact the army played no part whatever in the affair.  The little\nbody of men who expelled the few recalcitrant deputies were not\nsoldiers even, but the gendarmes of the Assembly itself.  The\ntrue author of the coup d'etat was the Government itself, with\nthe complicity of all France.\n\n\n4.  Causes of the Duration of the Revolution.\n\n\nIf we limit the Revolution to the time necessary for the conquest\nof its fundamental principles--equality before the law, free\naccess to public functions, popular sovereignty, control of\nexpenditures, &c.--we may say that it lasted only a few months.\nTowards the middle of 1789 all this was accomplished, and during\nthe years that followed nothing was added to it, yet the\nRevolution lasted much longer.\n\nConfining the duration to the dates admitted by the official\nhistorians, we see it persisting until the advent of Bonaparte, a\nspace of some ten years.\n\nWhy did this period of disorganisation and violence follow the\nestablishment of the new principles?  We need not seek the cause\nin the foreign war, which might on several occasions have been\nterminated, thanks to the divisions of the allies and the\nconstant victories of the French; neither must we look for it in\nthe sympathy of Frenchmen for the revolutionary Government.\nNever was rule more cordially hated and despised than that of the\nAssemblies.  By its revolts as well as by its repeated votes a\ngreat part of the nation displayed the horror with which it\nregarded the system.\n\nThis last point, the aversion of France for the revolutionary\nregime, so long misunderstood, has been well displayed by\nrecent historians.  The author of the last book published on the\nRevolution, M. Madelin, has well summarised their opinion in the\nfollowing words:--\n\n``As early as 1793 a party by no means numerous had seized upon\nFrance, the Revolution, and the Republic.  Now, three-quarters of\nFrance longed for the Revolution to be checked, or rather\ndelivered from its odious exploiters; but these held the unhappy\ncountry by a thousand means. . . .  As the Terror was essential\nto them if they were to rule, they struck at whomsoever seemed at\nany given moment to be opposed to the Terror, were they the best\nservants of the Revolution.''\n\nUp to the end of the Directory the government was exercised by\nJacobins, who merely desired to retain, along with the supreme\npower, the riches they had accumulated by murder and pillage, and\nwere ready to surrender France to any one who would guarantee\nthem free possession of these.  That they negotiated the coup\nd'etat of Brumaire with Napoleon was simply to the fact that\nthey had not been able to realise their wishes with regard to\nLouis XVIII.\n\nBut how explain the fact that a Government so tyrannical and so\ndishonoured was able to survive for so many years?\n\nIt was not merely because the revolutionary religion still\nsurvived in men's minds, nor because it was forced on them by\nmeans of persecution and bloodshed, but especially, as I have\nalready stated, on account of the great interest which a large\nportion of the population had in maintaining it.\n\nThis point is fundamental.  If the Revolution had remained a\ntheoretical religion, it would probably have been of short\nduration.  But the belief which had just been founded very\nquickly emerged from the domain of pure theory.\n\nThe Revolution did not confine itself to despoiling the monarchy,\nthe nobility, and the clergy of their powers of government.  In\nthrowing into the hands of the bourgeoisie and the large\nnumbers of peasantry the wealth and the employments of the old\nprivileged classes it had at the same stroke turned them into\nobstinate supporters of the revolutionary system.  All those who\nhad acquired the property of which the nobles and clergy had been\ndespoiled had obtained lands and chateaux at low prices, and\nwere terrified lest the restoration of the monarchy should force\nthem to make general restitution.\n\nIt was largely for these reasons that a Government which, at any\nnormal period, would never have been endured, was able to survive\nuntil a master should re-establish order, while promising to\nmaintain not only the moral but also the material conquests of\nthe Revolution.  Bonaparte realised these anxieties, and was\npromptly and enthusiastically welcomed.  Material conquests which\nwere still contestable and theoretical principles which were\nstill fragile were by him incorporated in institutions and the\nlaws.  It is an error to say that the Revolution terminated with\nhis advent.  Far from destroying it, he ratified and consolidated\nit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE RESTORATION OF ORDER.  THE CONSULAR REPUBLIC\n\n1.  How the Work of the Revolution was Confirmed by the\nConsulate.\n\nThe history of the Consulate is as rich as the preceding period\nin psychological material.  In the first place it shows us that\nthe work of a powerful individual is superior to that of a\ncollectivity.  Bonaparte immediately replaced the bloody anarchy\nin which the Republic had for ten years been writhing by a period\nof order.  That which none of the four Assemblies of the\nRevolution had been able to realise, despite the most violent\noppression, a single man accomplished in a very short space of\ntime.\n\nHis authority immediately put an end to all the Parisian\ninsurrections and the attempts at monarchical resistance, and re-\nestablished the moral unity of France, so profoundly divided by\nintense hatreds.  Bonaparte replaced an unorganised collective\ndespotism by a perfectly organised individual despotism.\nEveryone gained thereby, for his tyranny was infinitely less\nheavy than that which had been endured for ten long years.  We\nmust suppose, moreover, that it was unwelcome to very few, as it\nwas very soon accepted with immense enthusiasm.\n\nWe know better to-day than to repeat with the old historians that\nBonaparte overthrew the Republic.  On the contrary, he retained\nof it all that could be retained, and never would have been\nretained without him, by establishing all the practicable work of\nthe Revolution--the abolition of privileges, equality before the\nlaw, &c.--in institutions and codes of law.  The Consular\nGovernment continued, moreover, to call itself the Republic.\n\nIt is infinitely probable that without the Consulate a\nmonarchical restoration would have terminated the Directory, and\nwould have wiped out the greater part of the work of the\nRevolution.  Let us suppose Bonaparte erased from history.  No\none, I think, will imagine that the Directory could have survived\nthe universal weariness of its rule.  It would certainly have\nbeen overturned by the royalist conspiracies which were breaking\nout daily, and Louis XVIII. would probably have ascended the\nthrone.  Certainly he was to mount it sixteen years later, but\nduring this interval Bonaparte gave such force to the principles\nof the Revolution, by establishing them in laws and customs, that\nthe restored sovereign dared not touch them, nor restore the\nproperty of the returned emigres.\n\nMatters would have been very different had Louis XVIII.\nimmediately followed the Directory.  He would have brought with\nhim all the absolutism of the ancien regime, and fresh\nrevolutions would have been necessary to abolish it.  We know\nthat a mere attempt to return to the past overthrew Charles X.\n\nIt would be a little ingenuous to complain of the tyranny\nof Bonaparte.  Under the ancien regime Frenchmen had\nsupported every species of tyranny, and the Republic had created\na despotism even heavier than that of the monarchy.  Despotism\nwas then a normal condition, which aroused no protest save when\nit was accompanied by disorder.\n\nA constant law of the psychology of crowds shows them as creating\nanarchy, and then seeking the master who will enable them to\nemerge therefrom.  Bonaparte was this master.\n\n\n2.  The Reorganisation of France by the Consulate.\n\n\nUpon assuming power Bonaparte undertook a colossal task.  All was\nin ruins; all was to be rebuilt.  On the morrow of the coup of\nBrumaire he drafted, almost single-handed, the Constitution\ndestined to give him the absolute power which was to enable him\nto reorganise the country and to prevail over the factions.  In a\nmonth it was completed.\n\nThis Constitution, known as that of the year VIII., survived,\nwith slight modifications, until the end of his reign.  The\nexecutive power was the attribute of three Consuls, two of whom\npossessed a consultative voice only.  The first Consul,\nBonaparte, was therefore sole master of France.  He appointed\nministers, councillors of state, ambassadors, magistrates, and\nother officials, and decided upon peace or war.  The legislative\npower was his also, since only he could initiate the laws, which\nwere subsequently submitted to three Assemblies--the Council of\nState, the Tribunate, and the Legislative Corps.  A fourth\nAssembly, the Senate, acted effectually as the guardian of\nthe Constitution.\n\nDespotic as he was and became, Bonaparte always called the other\nConsuls about him before proceeding with the most trivial\nmeasure.  The Legislative Corps did not exercise much influence\nduring his reign, but he signed no decrees of any kind without\nfirst discussing them with the Council of State.  This Council,\ncomposed of the most enlightened and learned men of France,\nprepared laws, which were then presented to the Legislative\nCorps, which could criticise them very freely, since voting was\nsecret.  Presided over by Bonaparte, the Council of State was a\nkind of sovereign tribunal, judging even the actions of\nministers.[9]\n\n\n\n[9] Napoleon naturally often overruled the Council of State, but\nby no means always did so.  In one instance, reported in the\nMemorial de Sainte-Helene, he was the only one of his own\nopinion, and accepted that of the majority in the following\nterms:  ``Gentlemen, matters are decided here by majority, and\nbeing alone, I must give way; but I declare that in my conscience\nI yield only to form.  You have reduced me to silence, but in no\nway convinced me.''\n\nAnother day the Emperor, interrupted three times in the\nexpression of his opinion, addressed himself to the speaker who\nhad just interrupted him:  ``Sir, I have not yet finished; I beg\nyou to allow me to continue.  After all, it seems to me that\nevery one has a perfect right to express his opinion here.''\n\n``The Emperor, contrary to the accepted opinion, was so far from\nabsolute, and so easy with his Council of State, that he often\nresumed a discussion, or even annulled a decision, because one of\nthe members of the Council had since, in private, given him fresh\nreasons, or had urged that the Emperor's personal opinion had\ninfluenced the majority.''\n\n\n\n\nThe new master had great confidence in this Council, as it was\ncomposed more particularly of eminent jurists, each of whom dealt\nwith his own speciality.  He was too good a psychologist not to\nentertain the greatest suspicion of large and incompetent\nassemblies of popular origin, whose disastrous results had been\nobvious to him during the whole of the Revolution.\n\nWishing to govern for the people, but never with its assistance,\nBonaparte accorded it no part in the government, reserving to it\nonly the right of voting, once for all, for or against the\nadoption of the new Constitution.  He only in rare instances had\nrecourse to universal suffrage.  The members of the Legislative\nCorps recruited themselves, and were not elected by the people.\n\nIn creating a Constitution intended solely to fortify his own\npower, the First Consul had no illusion that it would serve to\nrestore the country.  Consequently, while he was drafting it he\nalso undertook the enormous task of the administrative, judicial,\nand financial reorganisation of France.  The various powers were\ncentralised in Paris.  Each department was directed by a prefect,\nassisted by a consul-general; the arrondissement by a sub-\nprefect, assisted by a council; the commune by a mayor, assisted\nby a municipal council.  All were appointed by the ministers, and\nnot by election, as under the Republic.\n\nThis system, which created the omnipotent State and a powerful\ncentralisation, was retained by all subsequent Governments and is\npreserved to-day.  Centralisation being, in spite of its\ndrawbacks, the only means of avoiding local tyrannies in a\ncountry profoundly divided within itself, has always been\nmaintained.\n\nThis organisation, based on a profound knowledge of the soul of\nthe French people, immediately restored that tranquillity and\norder which had for so long been unknown.\n\nTo complete the mental pacification of the country, the political\nexiles were recalled and the churches restored to the faithful.\n\nContinuing to rebuild the social edifice, Bonaparte busied\nhimself also with the drafting of a code, the greater part of\nwhich consisted of customs borrowed from the ancien regime.\nIt was, as has been said, a sort of transition or compromise\nbetween the old law and the new.\n\nConsidering the enormous task accomplished by the First Consul in\nso short a time, we realise that he had need, before all, of a\nConstitution according him absolute power.  If all the measures\nby which he restored France had been submitted to assemblies of\nattorneys, he could never have extricated the country from the\ndisorder into which it had fallen.\n\nThe Constitution of the year VIII. obviously transformed the\nRepublic into a monarchy at least as absolute as the ``Divine\nright'' monarchy of Louis XIV.  Being the only Constitution\nadapted to the needs of the moment, it represented a\npsychological necessity.\n\n\n3.  Psychological Elements which determined the Success of the\nWork of the Consulate.\n\n\nAll the external forces which act upon men--economic, historical,\ngeographical, &c.--may be finally translated into psychological\nforces.  These psychological forces a ruler must understand in\norder to govern.  The Revolutionary Assemblies were completely\nignorant of them; Bonaparte knew how to employ them.\n\nThe various Assemblies, the Convention notably, were composed of\nconflicting parties.  Napoleon understood that to dominate them\nhe must not belong to any one of these parties.  Very well aware\nthat the value of a country is disseminated among the superior\nintelligences of the various parties, he tried to utilise them\nall.  His agents of government--ministers, priests, magistrates,\n&c.--were taken indifferently from among the Liberals, Royalists,\nJacobites, &c., having regard only to their capacities.\n\nWhile accepting the assistance of men of the ancien regime,\nBonaparte took care to make it understood that he intended to\nmaintain the fundamental principles of the Revolution.\nNevertheless many Royalists rallied round the new Government.\n\nOne of the most remarkable feats of the Consulate, from the\npsychological point of view, was the restoration of religious\npeace.  France was far more divided by religious disagreement\nthan by political differences.  The systematic destruction of a\nportion of the Vendee had almost completely terminated the\nstruggle by force of arms, but without pacifying men's minds.  As\nonly one man, and he the head of Christianity, could assist in\nthis pacification, Bonaparte did not hesitate to treat with him.\nHis concordat was the work of a real psychologist, who knew that\nmoral forces do not use violence, and the great danger of\npersecuting such.  While conciliating the clergy he contrived to\nplace them under his own domination.  The bishops were to\nbe appointed and remunerated by the State, so that he would still\nbe master.\n\nThe religious policy of Napoleon had a bearing which escapes our\nmodern Jacobins.  Blinded by their narrow fanaticism, they do not\nunderstand that to detach the Church from the Government is to\ncreate a state within the State, so that they are liable to find\nthemselves opposed by a formidable caste, directed by a master\noutside France, and necessarily hostile to France.  To give one's\nenemies a liberty they did not possess is extremely dangerous.\nNever would Napoleon, nor any of the sovereigns who preceded him,\nhave consented to make the clergy independent of the State, as\nthey have become to-day.\n\nThe difficulties of Bonaparte the First Consul were far greater\nthan those he had to surmount after his coronation.  Only a\nprofound knowledge of men enabled him to triumph over them.  The\nfuture master was far from being the master as yet.  Many\ndepartments were still in insurrection.  Brigandage persisted,\nand the Midi was ravaged by the struggles of partisans.\nBonaparte, as Consul, had to conciliate and handle Talleyrand,\nFouche, and a number of generals who thought themselves his\nequal.  Even his brothers conspired against his power.  Napoleon,\nas Emperor, had no hostile party to face, but as Consul he\nhad to combat all the parties and to hold the balance equal among\nthem.  This must indeed have been a difficult task, since during\nthe last century very few Governments have succeeded in\naccomplishing it.\n\nThe success of such an undertaking demanded an extremely subtle\nmixture of finesse, firmness, and diplomacy.  Not feeling\nhimself powerful enough as yet, Bonaparte the Consul made a rule,\naccording to his own expression, ``of governing men as the\ngreater number wish to be governed.''  As Emperor he often\nmanaged to govern them according to his own ideal.\n\nWe have travelled a long way since the time when historians, in\ntheir singular blindness, and great poets, who possessed more\ntalent than psychology, would hold forth in indignant accents\nagainst the coup d'etat of Brumaire.  What profound\nillusions underlay the assertion that ``France lay fair in\nMessidor's great sun''!  And other illusions no less profound\nunderlay such verdicts as that of Victor Hugo concerning this\nperiod.  We have seen that the ``Crime of Brumaire'' had as an\nenthusiastic accomplice, not only the Government itself but the\nwhole of France, which it delivered from anarchy.\n\nOne may wonder how intelligent men could so misjudge a period of\nhistory which is nevertheless so clear.  It was doubtless because\nthey saw events through their own convictions, and we know what\ntransformations the truth may suffer for the man who is\nimprisoned in the valleys of belief.  The most luminous facts are\nobscured, and the history of events is the history of his dreams.\n\nThe psychologist who desires to understand the period which we\nhave so briefly sketched can only do so if, being attached to no\nparty, he stands clear of the passions which are the soul of\nparties.  He will never dream of recriminating a past which was\ndictated by such imperious necessities.  Certainly Napoleon has\ncost France dear: his epic was terminated by two invasions, and\nthere was yet to be a third, whose consequences are felt\neven to-day, when the prestige which he exerted even from the\ntomb set upon the throne the inheritor of his name.\n\nAll these events are narrowly connected in their origin.  They\nrepresent the price of that capital phenomenon in the evolution\nof a people, a change of ideal.  Man can never make the attempt\nto break suddenly with his ancestors without profoundly affecting\nthe course of his own history.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nPOLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN TRADITIONS AND\nREVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES DURING THE LAST CENTURY\n\n1.  The Psychological Causes of the continued Revolutionary\nMovements to which France has been subject.\n\nIn examining, in a subsequent chapter, the evolution of\nrevolutionary ideas during the last century, we shall see that\nduring more than fifty years they very slowly spread through the\nvarious strata of society.\n\nDuring the whole of this period the great majority of the people\nand the bourgeoisie rejected them, and their diffusion was\neffected only by a very limited number of apostles.  But their\ninfluence, thanks principally to the faults of Governments, was\nsufficient to provoke several revolutions.  We shall examine\nthese briefly when we have examined the psychological influences\nwhich gave them birth.\n\nThe history of our political upheavals during the last century is\nenough to prove, even if we did not yet realise the fact, that\nmen are governed by their mentalities far more than by the\ninstitutions which their rulers endeavour to force upon them.\n\nThe successive revolutions which France has suffered have been\nthe consequences of struggles between two portions of the\nnation whose mentalities are different.  One is religious and\nmonarchical and is dominated by long ancestral influences; the\nother is subjected to the same influences, but gives them a\nrevolutionary form.\n\nFrom the commencement of the Revolution the struggle between\ncontrary mentalities was plainly manifested.  We have seen that\nin spite of the most frightful repression insurrections and\nconspiracies lasted until the end of the Directory.  They proved\nthat the traditions of the past had left profound roots in the\npopular soul.  At a certain moment sixty departments were in\nrevolt against the new Government, and were only repressed by\nrepeated massacres on a vast scale.\n\nTo establish some sort of compromise between the ancien\nregime and the new ideals was the most difficult of the\nproblems which Bonaparte had to resolve.  He had to discover\ninstitutions which would suit the two mentalities into which\nFrance was divided.  He succeeded, as we have seen, by\nconciliatory measures, and also by dressing very ancient things\nin new names.\n\nHis reign was one of those rare periods of French history during\nwhich the mental unity of France was complete.\n\nThis unity could not outlive him.  On the morrow of his fall all\nthe old parties reappeared, and have survived until the present\nday.  Some attach themselves to traditional influences; others\nviolently reject them.\n\nIf this long conflict had been between believers and the\nindifferent, it could not have lasted, for indifference is\nalways tolerant; but the struggle was really between two\ndifferent beliefs.  The lay Church very soon assumed a religious\naspect, and its pretended rationalism has become, especially in\nrecent years, a barely attenuated form of the narrowest clerical\nspirit.  Now, we have shown that no conciliation is possible\nbetween dissimilar religious beliefs.  The clericals when in\npower could not therefore show themselves more tolerant towards\nfreethinkers than these latter are to-day toward the clericals.\n\nThese divisions, determined by differences of belief, were\ncomplicated by the addition of the political conceptions derived\nfrom those beliefs.\n\nMany simple souls have for long believed that the real history of\nFrance began with the year I. of the Republic.  This rudimentary\nconception is at last dying out.  Even the most rigid\nrevolutionaries renounce it,[10] and are quite willing to\nrecognise that the past was something better than an epoch of\nblack barbarism dominated by low superstitions.\n\n\n\n[10] We may judge of the recent evolution of ideas upon this\npoint by the following passage from a speech by M. Jaures,\ndelivered in the Chamber of Deputies:  ``The greatness of to-day\nis built of the efforts of past centuries.  France is not\ncontained in a day nor in an epoch, but in the succession of all\ndays, all periods, all her twilights and all her dawns.''\n\n\n\n\nThe religious origin of most of the political beliefs held in\nFrance inspires their adepts with an inextinguishable hatred\nwhich always strikes foreigners with amazement.\n\n``Nothing is more obvious, nothing is more certain,'' writes Mr.\nBarret-Wendell, in his book on France, ``than this fact: that not\nonly have the royalists, revolutionaries, and Bonapartists\nalways been mortally opposed to one another, but that, owing to\nthe passionate ardour of the French character, they have always\nentertained a profound intellectual horror for one another.  Men\nwho believe themselves in possession of the truth cannot refrain\nfrom affirming that those who do not think with them are\ninstruments of error.\n\n``Each party will gravely inform you that the advocates of the\nadverse cause are afflicted by a dense stupidity or are\nconsciously dishonest.  Yet when you meet these latter, who will\nsay exactly the same things as their detractors, you cannot but\nrecognise, in all good faith, that they are neither stupid nor\ndishonest.''\n\nThis reciprocal execration of the believers of each party has\nalways facilitated the overthrow of Governments and ministers in\nFrance.  The parties in the minority will never refuse to ally\nthemselves against the triumphant party.  We know that a great\nnumber of revolutionary Socialists have been elected to the\npresent Chamber only by the aid of the monarchists, who are still\nas unintelligent as they were at the time of the Revolution.\n\nOur religious and political differences do not constitute the\nonly cause of dissension in France.  They are held by men\npossessing that particular mentality which I have already\ndescribed under the name of the revolutionary mentality.  We have\nseen that each period always presents a certain number of\nindividuals ready to revolt against the established order of\nthings, whatever that may be, even though it may realise all\ntheir desires.\n\nThe intolerance of the parties in France, and their desire to\nseize upon power, are further favoured by the conviction, so\nprevalent under the Revolution, that societies can be remade by\nmeans of laws.  The modern State, whatever its leader, has\ninherited in the eyes of the multitudes and their leaders the\nmystic power attributed to the ancient kings, when these latter\nwere regarded as an incarnation of the Divine will.  Not only the\npeople is inspired by this confidence in the power of Government;\nall our legislators entertain it also.[11]\n\n\n\n[11] After the publication of an article of mine concerning\nlegislative illusions, I received from one of our most eminent\npoliticians, M. Boudenot the senator, a letter from which I\nextract the following passage:  ``Twenty years passed in the\nChamber and the Senate have shown me how right you are.  How many\ntimes I have heard my colleagues say:  `The Government ought to\nprevent this, order that,' &c.  What would you have? there are\nfourteen centuries of monarchical atavism in our blood.''\n\n\n\n\nLegislating always, politicians never realise that as\ninstitutions are effects, and not causes, they have no virtue in\nthemselves.  Heirs to the great revolutionary illusion, they do\nnot see that man is created by a past whose foundations we are\npowerless to reshape.\n\nThe conflict between the principles dividing France, which has\nlasted more than a century, will doubtless continue for a long\ntime yet, and no one can foresee what fresh upheavals it may\nengender.  No doubt if before our era the Athenians could have\ndivined that their social dissensions would have led to the\nenslavement of Greece, they would have renounced them; but how\ncould they have foreseen as much?  M. Guiraud justly writes:  ``A\ngeneration of men very rarely realises the task which it\nis accomplishing.  It is preparing for the future; but this\nfuture is often the contrary of what it wishes.''\n\n\n2.  Summary of a Century's Revolutionary Movement in France.\n\n\nThe psychological causes of the revolutionary movements which\nFrance has seen during the past century having been explained, it\nwill now suffice to present a summary picture of these successive\nrevolutions.\n\nThe sovereigns in coalition having defeated Napoleon, they\nreduced France to her former limits, and placed Louis XVIII., the\nonly possible sovereign, on the throne.\n\nBy a special charter the new king accepted the position of a\nconstitutional monarch under a representative system of\ngovernment.  He recognised all the conquests of the Revolution:\nthe civil Code, equality before the law, liberty of worship,\nirrevocability of the sale of national property, &c.  The right\nof suffrage, however, was limited to those paying a certain\namount in taxes.\n\nThis liberal Constitution was opposed by the ultra-royalists.\nReturned emigres, they wanted the restitution of the national\nproperty, and the re-establishment of their ancient privileges.\n\nFearing that such a reaction might cause a new revolution, Louis\nXVIII. was reduced to dissolving the Chamber.  The election\nhaving returned moderate deputies, he was able to continue to\ngovern with the same principles, understanding very well that any\nattempt to govern the French by the ancien regime would be\nenough to provoke a general rebellion.\n\nUnfortunately, his death, in 1824, placed Charles X., formerly\nComte d'Artois, on the throne.  Extremely narrow, incapable of\nunderstanding the new world which surrounded him, and boasting\nthat he had not modified his ideas since 1789, he prepared a\nseries of reactionary laws--a law by which an indemnity of forty\nmillions sterling was to be paid to emigres; a law of sacrilege;\nand laws establishing the rights of primogeniture, the\npreponderance of the clergy, &c.\n\nThe majority of the deputies showing themselves daily more\nopposed to his projects, in 1830 he enacted Ordinances dissolving\nthe Chamber, suppressing the liberty of the Press, and preparing\nfor the restoration of the ancien regime.\n\nThe effect was immediate.  This autocratic action provoked a\ncoalition of the leaders of all parties.  Republicans,\nBonapartists, Liberals, Royalists--all united in order to raise\nthe Parisian populace.  Four days after the publication of the\nOrdinances the insurgents were masters of the capital, and\nCharles X. fled to England.\n\nThe leaders of the movement--Thiers, Casimir-Perier, La Fayette,\n&c.--summoned to Paris Louis-Philippe, of whose existence the\npeople were scarcely aware, and declared him king of the French.\n\nBetween the indifference of the people and the hostility of the\nnobles, who had remained faithful to the legitimate dynasty, the\nnew king relied chiefly upon the bourgeoisie.  An electoral law\nhaving reduced the electors to less than 200,000, this class\nplayed an exclusive part in the government.\n\nThe situation of the sovereign was not easy.  He had to struggle\nsimultaneously against the legitimist supporters of Henry\nV. the grandson of Charles X., and the Bonapartists, who\nrecognised as their head Louis-Napoleon, the Emperor's nephew,\nand finally against the republicans.\n\nBy means of their secret societies, analogous to the clubs of the\nRevolution, the latter provoked numerous riots at various\nintervals between 1830 and 1840, but these were easily repressed.\n\nThe clericals and legitimists, on their side, did not cease their\nintrigues.  The Duchess de Berry, the mother of Henry V., tried\nin vain to raise the Vendee.  As to the clergy, their demands\nfinally made them so intolerable that an insurrection broke out,\nin the course of which the palace of the archbishop of Paris was\nsacked.\n\nThe republicans as a party were not very dangerous, as the\nChamber sided with the king in the struggle against them.  The\nminister Guizot, who advocated a strong central power, declared\nthat two things were indispensable to government--``reason and\ncannon.''  The famous statesman was surely somewhat deluded as to\nthe necessity or efficacy of reason.\n\nDespite this strong central power, which in reality was not\nstrong, the republicans, and above all the Socialists, continued\nto agitate.  One of the most influential, Louis Blanc, claimed\nthat it was the duty of the Government to procure work for every\ncitizen.  The Catholic party, led by Lacordaire and Montalembert,\nunited with the Socialists--as to-day in Belgium--to oppose the\nGovernment.\n\nA campaign in favour of electoral reform ended in 1848 in a fresh\nriot, which unexpectedly overthrew Louis-Philippe.\n\nHis fall was far less justifiable than that of Charles X.  There\nwas little with which he could be reproached.  Doubtless he was\nsuspicious of universal suffrage, but the French Revolution had\nmore than once been quite suspicious of it.  Louis-Philippe not\nbeing, like the Directory, an absolute ruler, could not, as the\nlatter had done, annul unfavourable elections.\n\nA provisional Government was installed in the Hotel de Ville,\nto replace the fallen monarchy.  It proclaimed the Republic,\nestablished universal suffrage, and decreed that the people\nshould proceed to the election of a National Assembly of nine\nhundred members.\n\nFrom the first days of its existence the new Government found\nitself the victim of socialistic manoeuvres and riots.\n\nThe psychological phenomena observed during the first Revolution\nwere now to be witnessed again.  Clubs were formed, whose leaders\nsent the people from time to time against the Assembly, for\nreasons which were generally quite devoid of common sense--for\nexample, to force the Government to support an insurrection in\nPoland, &c.\n\nIn the hope of satisfying the Socialists, every day more noisy\nand exigent, the Assembly organised national workshops, in which\nthe workers were occupied in various forms of labour.  In these\n100,000 men cost the State more than L40,000 weekly.  Their\nclaim to receive pay without working for it forced the Assembly\nto close the workshops.\n\nThis measure was the origin of a formidable insurrection, 50,000\nworkers revolting.  The Assembly, terrified, confided all\nthe executive powers to General Cavaignac.  There was a four-days\nbattle with the insurgents, during which three generals and the\nArchbishop of Paris were killed; 3,000 prisoners were deported by\nthe Assembly to Algeria, and revolutionary Socialism was\nannihilated for a space of fifty years.\n\nThese events brought Government stock down from 116 to 50 francs.\nBusiness was at a standstill.  The peasants, who thought\nthemselves threatened by the Socialists, and the bourgeois,\nwhose taxes the Assembly had increased by half, turned against\nthe Republic, and when Louis-Napoleon promised to re-establish\norder he found himself welcomed with enthusiasm.  A candidate for\nthe position of President of the Republic, who according to the\nnew Constitution must be elected by the whole body of citizens,\nhe was chosen by 5,500,000 votes.\n\nVery soon at odds with the Chamber, the prince decided on a coup\nd'etat.  The Assembly was dissolved; 30,000 persons were\narrested, 10,000 deported, and a hundred deputies were exiled.\n\nThis coup d'etat, although summary, was very favourably\nreceived, for when submitted to a plebiscite it received\n7,500,000 votes out of 8,000,000.\n\nOn the 2nd of November, 1852, Napoleon had himself named Emperor\nby an even greater majority:  The horror which the generality of\nFrenchmen felt for demagogues and Socialists had restored the\nEmpire.\n\nIn the first part of its existence it constituted an absolute\nGovernment, and during the latter half a liberal Government.\nAfter eighteen years of rule the Emperor was overthrown by the\nrevolution of the 4th of September, 1870, after the capitulation\nof Sedan.\n\nSince that time revolutionary movements have been rare; the only\none of importance was the revolution of March, 1871, which\nresulted in the burning of many of the monuments of Paris and the\nexecution of about 20,000 insurgents.\n\nAfter the war of 1870 the electors, who, amid so many disasters,\ndid not know which way to turn, sent a great number of Orleanist\nand legitimist deputies to the Constituent Assembly.  Unable to\nagree upon the establishment of a monarchy, they appointed M.\nThiers President of the Republic, later replacing him by Marshal\nMacMahon.  In 1876 the new elections, like all those that have\nfollowed, sent a majority of republicans to the Chamber.\n\nThe various assemblies which have succeeded to this have always\nbeen divided into numerous parties, which have provoked\ninnumerable changes of ministry.\n\nHowever, thanks to the equilibrium resulting from this division\nof parties, we have for forty years enjoyed comparative quiet.\nFour Presidents of the Republic have been overthrown without\nrevolution, and the riots that have occurred, such as those of\nChampagne and the Midi, have not had serious consequences.\n\nA great popular movement, in 1888, did nearly overthrow the\nRepublic for the benefit of General Boulanger, but it has\nsurvived and triumphed over the attacks of all parties.\n\nVarious reasons contribute to the maintenance of the present\nRepublic.  In the first place, of the conflicting factions\nnone is strong enough to crush the rest.  In the second place,\nthe head of the State being purely decorative, and possessing no\npower, it is impossible to attribute to him the evils from which\nthe country may suffer, and to feel sure that matters would be\ndifferent were he overthrown.  Finally, as the supreme power is\ndistributed among thousands of hands, responsibilities are so\ndisseminated that it would be difficult to know where to begin.\nA tyrant can be overthrown, but what can be done against a host\nof little anonymous tyrannies?\n\nIf we wished to sum up in a word the great transformations which\nhave been effected in France by a century of riots and\nrevolutions, we might say that individual tyranny, which was weak\nand therefore easily overthrown, has been replaced by collective\ntyrannies, which are very strong and difficult to destroy.  To a\npeople avid of equality and habituated to hold its Governments\nresponsible for every event individual tyranny seemed\ninsupportable, while a collective tyranny is readily endured,\nalthough generally much more severe.\n\nThe extension of the tyranny of the State has therefore been the\nfinal result of all our revolutions, and the common\ncharacteristic of all systems of government which we have known\nin France.  This form of tyranny may be regarded as a racial\nideal, since successive upheavals of France have only fortified\nit.  Statism is the real political system of the Latin peoples,\nand the only system that receives all suffrages.  The other forms\nof government--republic, monarchy, empire--represent empty\nlabels, powerless shadows.\n\n\nPART III\n\nTHE RECENT EVOLUTION OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE PROGRESS OF DEMOCRATIC BELIEFS SINCE THE REVOLUTION\n\n1.  Gradual Propagation of Democratic Ideas after the Revolution.\n\nIdeas which are firmly established, incrusted, as it were, in\nmen's minds, continue to act for several generations.  Those\nwhich resulted from the French Revolution were, like others,\nsubject to this law.\n\nAlthough the life of the Revolution as a Government was short,\nthe influence of its principles was, on the contrary, very long-\nlived.  Becoming a form of religious belief, they profoundly\nmodified the orientation of the sentiments and ideas of several\ngenerations.\n\nDespite a few intervals, the French Revolution has continued up\nto the present, and still survives.  The role of Napoleon\nwas not confined to overturning the world, changing the map of\nEurope, and remaking the exploits of Alexander.  The new rights\nof the people, created by the Revolution and established by its\ninstitutions, have exercised a profound influence.  The military\nwork of the conqueror was soon dissolved, but the revolutionary\nprinciples which he contributed to propagate have survived him.\n\nThe various restorations which followed the Empire caused men at\nfirst to become somewhat forgetful of the principles of the\nRevolution.  For fifty years this propagation was far from rapid.\nOne might almost have supposed that the people had forgotten\nthem.  Only a small number of theorists maintained their\ninfluence.  Heirs to the ``simplicist'' spirit of the Jacobins,\nbelieving, like them, that societies can be remade from top to\nbottom by the laws, and persuaded that the Empire had only\ninterrupted the task of revolution, they wished to resume it.\n\nWhile waiting until they could recommence, they attempted to\nspread the principles of the Revolution by means of their\nwritings.  Faithful imitators of the men of the Revolution, they\nnever stopped to ask if their schemes for reform were in\nconformity with human nature.  They too were erecting a\nchimerical society for an ideal man, and were persuaded that the\napplication of their dreams would regenerate the human species.\n\nDeprived of all constructive power, the theorists of all the ages\nhave always been very ready to destroy.  Napoleon at St. Helena\nstated that ``if there existed a monarchy of granite the\nidealists and theorists would manage to reduce it to powder.''\n\nAmong the galaxy of dreamers such as Saint-Simon, Fourier, Pierre\nLeroux, Louis Blanc, Quinet, &c., we find that only Auguste Comte\nunderstood that a transformation of manners and ideas must\nprecede political reorganisation.\n\nFar from favouring the diffusion of democratic ideas, the\nprojects of reform of the theorists of this period merely impeded\ntheir progress.  Communistic Socialism, which several of\nthem professed would restore the Revolution, finally alarmed the\nbourgeoisie and even the working-classes.  We have already seen\nthat the fear of their ideas was one of the principal causes of\nthe restoration of the Empire.\n\nIf none of the chimerical lucubrations of the writers of the\nfirst half of the nineteenth century deserve to be discussed, it\nis none the less interesting to examine them in order to observe\nthe part played by religious and moral ideas which to-day are\nregarded with contempt.  Persuaded that a new society could not,\nany more than the societies of old, be built up without religious\nand moral beliefs, the reformers were always endeavouring to\nfound such beliefs.\n\nBut on what could they be based?  Evidently on reason.  By means\nof reason men create complicated machines: why not therefore a\nreligion and a morality, things which are apparently so simple?\nNot one of them suspected the fact that no religious or moral\nbelief ever had rational logic as its basis.  Auguste Comte saw\nno more clearly.  We know that he founded a so-called positivist\nreligion, which still has a few followers.  Scientists were to\nform a clergy directed by a new Pope, who was to replace the\nCatholic Pope.\n\nAll these conceptions--political, religious, or moral--had, I\nrepeat, no other results for a long time than to turn the\nmultitude away from democratic principles.\n\nIf these principles did finally become widespread, it was not on\naccount of the theorists, but because new conditions of life had\narisen.  Thanks to the discoveries of science, industry developed\nand led to the erection of immense factories.  Economic\nnecessities increasingly dominated the wills of Governments and\nthe people and finally created a favourable soil for the\nextension of Socialism, and above all of Syndicalism, the modern\nforms of democratic ideas.\n\n\n2.  The Unequal Influence of the Three Fundamental Principles of\nthe Revolution.\n\n\nThe heritage of the Revolution is summed up in its entirety in\nthe one phrase--Liberty, equality, and Fraternity.  The\nprinciple of equality, as we have seen, has exerted a powerful\ninfluence, but the two others did not share its lot.\n\nAlthough the sense of these terms seems clear enough, they were\ncomprehended in very different fashions according to men and\ntimes.  We know that the various interpretation of the same words\nby persons of different mentality has been one of the most\nfrequent causes of the conflicts of history.\n\nTo the member of the Convention liberty signified merely the\nexercise of its unlimited despotism.  To a young modern\n``intellectual'' the same word means a general release from\neverything irksome: tradition, law, superiority, &c.  To the\nmodern Jacobin liberty consists especially in the right to\npersecute his adversaries.\n\nAlthough political orators still occasionally mention liberty in\ntheir speeches, they have generally ceased to evoke fraternity.\nIt is the conflict of the different classes and not their\nalliance that they teach to-day.  Never did a more profound\nhatred divide the various strata of society and the political\nparties which lead them.\n\nBut while liberty has become very doubtful and fraternity has\ncompletely vanished, the principle of equality has grown\nunchecked.  It has been supreme in all the political upheavals of\nwhich France has been the stage during the last century, and has\nreached such a development that our political and social life,\nour laws, manners, and customs are at least in theory based on\nthis principle.  It constitutes the real legacy of the\nRevolution.  The craving for equality, not only before the law,\nbut in position and fortune, is the very pivot of the last\nproduct of democracy:  Socialism.  This craving is so powerful\nthat it is spreading in all directions, although in contradiction\nwith all biological and economic laws.  It is a new phase of the\ninterrupted struggle of the sentiments against reason, in which\nreason so rarely triumphs.\n\n\n2.  The Democracy of the ``Intellectuals'' and Popular Democracy.\n\n\nAll ideas that have hitherto caused an upheaval of the world of\nmen have been subject to two laws: they evolve slowly, and they\ncompletely change their sense according to the mentalities in\nwhich they find reception.\n\nA doctrine may be compared to a living being.  It subsists only\nby process of transformation.  The books are necessarily silent\nupon these variations, so that the phase of things which they\nestablish belongs only to the past.  They do not reflect the\nimage of the living, but of the dead.  The written statement of a\ndoctrine often represents the most negligible side of that\ndoctrine.\n\nI have shown in another work how institutions, arts, and\nlanguages are modified in passing from one people to another, and\nhow the laws of these transformations differ from the truth as\nstated in books.  I allude to this matter now merely to show why,\nin examining the subject of democratic ideas, we occupy ourselves\nso little with the text of doctrines, and seek only for the\npsychological elements of which they constitute the vestment, and\nthe reactions which they provoke in the various categories of men\nwho have accepted them.\n\nModified rapidly by men of different mentalities, the original\ntheory is soon no more than a label which denotes something quite\nunlike itself.\n\nApplicable to religious beliefs, these principles are equally so\nto political beliefs.  When a man speaks of democracy, for\nexample, must we inquire what this word means to various peoples,\nand also whether in the same people there is not a great\ndifference between the democracy of the ``intellectuals'' and\npopular democracy.\n\nIn confining ourselves now to the consideration of this latter\npoint we shall readily perceive that the democratic ideas to be\nfound in books and journals are purely the theories of literary\npeople, of which the people know nothing, and by the application\nof which they would have nothing to gain.  Although the working-\nman possesses the theoretical right of passing the barriers which\nseparate him from the upper classes by a whole series of\ncompetitions and examinations, his chance of reaching them is in\nreality extremely slight.\n\nThe democracy of the lettered classes has no other object than to\nset up a selection which shall recruit the directing classes\nexclusively from themselves.  I should have nothing to say\nagainst this if the selection were real.  It would then\nconstitute the application of the maxim of Napoleon:  ``The true\nmethod of government is to employ the aristocracy, but under the\nforms of democracy.''\n\nUnhappily the democracy of the ``intellectuals'' would simply\nlead to the substitution of the Divine right of kings by the\nDivine right of a petty oligarchy, which is too often narrow and\ntyrannical.  Liberty cannot be created by replacing a tyranny.\n\nPopular democracy by no means aims at manufacturing rulers.\nDominated entirely by the spirit of equality and the desire to\nameliorate the lot of the workers, it rejects the idea of\nfraternity, and exhibits no anxiety in respect of liberty.  No\ngovernment is conceivable to popular democracy except in the form\nof an autocracy.  We see this, not only in history, which shows\nus that since the Revolution all despotic Governments have been\nvigorously acclaimed, but also in the autocratic fashion in which\nthe workers' trades unions are conducted.\n\nThis profound distinction between the democracy of the lettered\nclasses and popular democracy is far more obvious to the workers\nthan to the intellectuals.  In their mentalities there is nothing\nin common; the two classes do not speak the same language.  The\nsyndicalists emphatically assert to-day that no alliance could\npossibly exist between them and the politicians of the\nbourgeoisie.  This assertion is strictly true.\n\nIt was always so, and this, no doubt, is why popular\ndemocracy, from Plato's to our own times, has never been defended\nby the great thinkers.\n\nThis fact has greatly struck Emile Faguet.  ``Almost all the\nthinkers of the nineteenth century,'' he says, ``were not\ndemocrats.  When I was writing my Politiques et moralistes du\nXIXe siecle this was my despair.  I could not find one who had\nbeen a democrat; yet I was extremely anxious to find one so that\nI could give the democratic doctrine as formulated by him.''\n\nThe eminent writer might certainly have found plenty of\nprofessional politicians, but these latter rarely belong to the\ncategory of thinkers.\n\n\n2.  Natural Inequalities and Democratic Equalisation.\n\n\nThe difficulty of reconciling democratic equalisation with\nnatural inequalities constitutes one of the most difficult\nproblems of the present hour.  We know what are the desires of\ndemocracy.  Let us see what Nature replies to these demands.\n\nThe democratic ideas which have so often shaken the world from\nthe heroic ages of Greece to modern times are always clashing\nwith natural inequalities.  Some observers have held, with\nHelvetius, that the inequality between men is created by\neducation.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Nature does not know such a thing as\nequality.  She distributes unevenly genius, beauty, health,\nvigour, intelligence, and all the qualities which confer on their\npossessors a superiority over their fellows.\n\nNo theory can alter these discrepancies, so that democratic\ndoctrines will remain confined to words until the laws of\nheredity consent to unify the capacities of men.\n\nCan we suppose that societies will ever succeed in establishing\nartificially the equality refused by Nature?\n\nA few theorists have believed for a long time that education\nmight effect a general levelling.  Many years of experience have\nshown the depth of this illusion.\n\nIt would not, however, be impossible for a triumphant Socialism\nto establish equality for a time by rigorously eliminating all\nsuperior individuals.  One can easily foresee what would become\nof a people that had suppressed its best individuals while\nsurrounded by other nations progressing by means of their best\nindividuals.\n\nNot only does Nature not know equality, but since the beginning\nof the ages she has always realised progress by means of\nsuccessive differentiations--that is to say, by increasing\ninequalities.  These alone could raise the obscure cell of the\nearly geological periods to the superior beings whose inventions\nwere to change the face of the earth.\n\nThe same phenomenon is to be observed in societies.  The forms of\ndemocracy which select the better elements of the popular classes\nfinally result in the creation of an intellectual aristocracy, a\nresult the contrary of the dream of the pure theorists, to beat\ndown the superior elements of society to the level of the\ninferior elements.\n\nOn the side of natural law, which is hostile to theories of\nequality, are the conditions of modern progress.  Science and\nindustry demand more and more considerable intellectual\nefforts, so that mental inequalities and the differences of\nsocial condition which spring from them cannot but become\naccentuated.\n\nWe therefore observe this striking phenomenon: as laws and\ninstitutions seek to level individuals the progress of\ncivilisation tends still further to differentiate them.  From the\npeasant to the feudal baron the intellectual difference was not\ngreat, but from the working-man to the engineer it is immense and\nis increasing daily.\n\nCapacity being the principal factor of progress, the capable of\neach class rise while the mediocre remain stationary or sink.\nWhat could laws do in the face of such inevitable necessities?\n\nIn vain do the incapable pretend that, representing number, they\nalso represent force.  Deprived of the superior brains by whose\nresearches all workers profit, they would speedily sink into\npoverty and anarchy.\n\nThe capital role of the elect in modern civilisation seems\ntoo obvious to need pointing out.  In the case of civilised\nnations and barbarian peoples, which contain similar averages of\nmediocrities, the superiority of the former arises solely from\nthe superior minds which they contain.  The United States have\nunderstood this so thoroughly that they forbid the immigration of\nChinese workers, whose capacity is identical with that of\nAmerican workers, and who, working for lower wages, tend to\ncreate a formidable competition with the latter.  Despite these\nevidences we see the antagonism between the multitude and the\nelect increasing day by day.  At no period were the elect more\nnecessary, yet never were they supported with such difficulty.\n\nOne of the most solid foundations of Socialism is an intense\nhatred of the elect.  Its adepts always forget that scientific,\nartistic, and industrial progress, which creates the strength of\na country and the prosperity of millions of workers, is due\nsolely to a small number of superior brains.\n\nIf the worker makes three times as much to-day as he did a\nhundred years ago, and enjoys commodities then unknown to great\nnobles, he owes it entirely to the elect.\n\nSuppose that by some miracle Socialism had been universally\naccepted a century ago.  Risk, speculation, initiative--in a\nword, all the stimulants of human activity--being suppressed, no\nprogress would have been possible, and the worker would have\nremained as poor as he was.  Men would merely have established\nthat equality in poverty desired by the jealousy and envy of a\nhost of mediocre minds.  Humanity will never renounce the\nprogress of civilisation to satisfy so low an ideal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE RESULTS OF DEMOCRATIC EVOLUTION\n\n1.  The Influence upon Social Evolution of Theories of no\nRational Value.\n\nWe have seen that natural laws do not agree with the aspirations\nof democracy.  We know, also, that such a statement has never\naffected doctrines already in men's minds.  The man led by a\nbelief never troubles about its real value.\n\nThe philosopher who studies a belief must obviously discuss its\nrational content, but he is more concerned with its influences\nupon the general mind.\n\nApplied to the interpretation of all the great beliefs of\nhistory, the importance of this distinction is at once evident.\nJupiter, Moloch, Vishnu, Allah, and so many other divinities,\nwere, no doubt, from the rational point of view, mere illusions,\nyet their effect upon the life of the peoples has been\nconsiderable.\n\nThe same distinction is applicable to the beliefs which prevailed\nduring the Middle Ages.  Equally illusory, they nevertheless\nexercised as profound an influence as if they had corresponded\nwith realities.\n\nIf any one doubts this, let him compare the domination of the\nRoman Empire and that of the Church of Rome.  The first was\nperfectly real and tangible, and implied no illusion.  The\nsecond, while its foundations were entirely chimerical, was fully\nas powerful.  Thanks to it, during the long night of the Middle\nAges, semi-barbarous peoples acquired those social bonds and\nrestraints and that national soul without which there is no\ncivilisation.\n\nThe power possessed by the Church proves, again, that the power\nof certain illusions is sufficiently great to create, at least\nmomentarily, sentiments as contrary to the interests of the\nindividual as they are to that of society--such as the love of\nthe monastic life, the desire for martyrdom, the crusades, the\nreligious wars, &c.\n\nThe application to democratic and socialistic ideas of the\npreceding considerations shows that it matters little that these\nideas have no defensible basis.  They impress and influence men's\nminds, and that is sufficient.  Their results may be disastrous\nin the extreme, but we cannot prevent them.\n\nThe apostles of the new doctrines are quite wrong in taking so\nmuch trouble to find a rational basis for their aspirations.\nThey would be far more convincing were they to confine themselves\nto making affirmations and awakening hopes.  Their real strength\nresides in the religious mentality which is inherent in the heart\nof man, and which during the ages has only changed its object.\n\nLater on we shall consider from a philosophical point of view\nvarious consequences of the democratic evolution whose course we\nsee accelerating.  We may say in respect of the Church in the\nMiddle Ages that it had the power of profoundly influencing the\nmentality of men.  Examining certain results of the\ndemocratic doctrines, we shall see that the power of these is no\nless than that of the Church.\n\n\n2.  The Jacobin Spirit and the Mentality created by Democratic\nBeliefs.\n\n\nExisting generations have inherited, not only the revolutionary\nprinciples but also the special mentality which achieves their\nsuccess.\n\nDescribing this mentality when we were examining the Jacobin\nspirit, we saw that it always endeavours to impose by force\nillusions which it regards as the truth.  The Jacobin spirit has\nfinally become so general in France and in other Latin countries\nthat it has affected all political parties, even the most\nconservative.  The bourgeoisie is strongly affected by it, and\nthe people still more so.\n\nThis increase of the Jacobin spirit has resulted in the fact that\npolitical conceptions, institutions, and laws tend to impose\nthemselves by force.  Syndicalism, peaceful enough in other\ncountries, immediately assumed in France an uncompromising and\nanarchical aspect, which betrayed itself in the shape of riots,\nsabotage, and incendiarism.\n\nNot to be repressed by timid Governments, the Jacobin spirit\nproduces melancholy ravages in minds of mediocre capacity.  At a\nrecent congress of railway men a third of the delegates voted\napproval of sabotage, and one of the secretaries of the\nCongress began his speech by saying:  ``I send all saboteurs my\nfraternal greeting and all my admiration.''\n\nThis general mentality engenders an increasing anarchy.  That\nFrance is not in a permanent state of anarchy is, as I have\nalready remarked, due to the fact that the parties by which she\nis divided produce something like equilibrium.  They are animated\nby a mortal hatred for one another, but none of them is strong\nenough to enslave its rivals.\n\nThis Jacobin intolerance is spreading to such an extent that the\nrulers themselves employ without scruple the most revolutionary\ntactics with regard to their enemies, violently persecuting any\nparty that offers the least resistance, and even despoiling it of\nits property.  Our rulers to-day behave as the ancient conquerors\nused; the vanquished have nothing to hope from the victors.\n\nFar from being peculiar to the lower orders, intolerance is\nequally prominent among the ruling classes.  Michelet remarked\nlong ago that the violence of the cultivated classes is often\ngreater than that of the people.  It is true that they do not\nbreak the street lamps, but they are ready enough to cause heads\nto be broken.  The worst violence of the revolution was the work\nof cultivated bourgeoisie--professors, lawyers, &c., possessors\nof that classical education which is supposed to soften the\nmanners.  It has not done so in these days, any more than it did\nof old.  One can make sure of this by reading the advanced\njournals, whose contributors and editors are recruited chiefly\nfrom among the professors of the University.\n\nTheir books are as violent as their articles, and one wonders how\nsuch favourites of fortune can have secreted such stores of\nhatred.\n\nOne would find it hard to credit them did they assure us that\nthey were consumed by an intense passion for altruism.  One\nmight more readily admit that apart from a narrow religious\nmentality the hope of being remarked by the mighty ones of the\nday, or of creating a profitable popularity, is the only\npossible explanation of the violence recommended in their\nwritten propaganda.\n\nI have already, in one of my preceding works, cited some passages\nfrom a book written by a professor at the College of France, in\nwhich the author incites the people to seize upon the riches of\nthe bourgeoisie, whom he furiously abuses, and have arrived at\nthe conclusion that a new revolution would readily find among the\nauthors of such books the Marats, Robespierres, and Carriers whom\nit might require.\n\nThe Jacobin religion--above all in its Socialist form--has all\nthe power of the ancient faiths over feeble minds Blinded by\ntheir faith, they believe that reason is their guide, but are\nreally actuated solely by their passions and their dreams.\n\nThe evolution of democratic ideas has thus produced not only the\npolitical results already mentioned, but also a considerable\neffect upon the mentality of modern men.\n\nIf the ancient dogmas have long ago exhausted their power, the\ntheories of democracy are far from having lost theirs, and we see\ntheir consequences increasing daily.  One of the chief results\nhas been the general hatred of superiority.\n\nThis hatred of whatever passes the average in social fortune or\nintelligence is to-day general in all classes, from the working-\nclasses to the upper strata of the bourgeoisie.  The results\nare envy, detraction, and a love of attack, of raillery, of\npersecution, and a habit of attributing all actions to low\nmotives, of refusing to believe in probity, disinterestedness,\nand intelligence.\n\nConversation, among the people as among the most cultivated\nFrenchmen, is stamped with the craze for abasing and abusing\neverything and everyone.  Even the greatest of the dead do not\nescape this tendency.  Never were so many books written to\ndepreciate the merit of famous men, men who were formerly\nregarded as the most precious patrimony of their country.\n\nEnvy and hatred seem from all time to have been inseparable from\ndemocratic theories, but the spread of these sentiments has never\nbeen so great as to-day.  It strikes all observers.\n\n``There is a low demagogic instinct,'' writes M. Bourdeau,\n``without any moral inspiration, which dreams of pulling humanity\ndown to the lowest level, and for which any superiority, even of\nculture, is an offence to society. . . it is the sentiment of\nignoble equality which animated the Jacobin butchers when they\nstruck off the head of a Lavoisier or a Chenier.\n\nThis hatred of superiority, the most prominent element in the\nmodern progress of Socialism, is not the only characteristic of\nthe new spirit created by democratic ideas.\n\nOther consequences, although indirect, are not less profound.\nSuch, for example, are the progress of ``statism,'' the\ndiminution of the power of the bourgeoisie, the increasing\nactivity of financiers, the conflict of the classes, the\nvanishing of the old social constraints, and the degradation\nof morality.\n\nAll these effects are displayed in a general insubordination and\nanarchy.  The son revolts against the father, the employee\nagainst his patron, the soldier against his officers.\nDiscontent, hatred, and envy reign throughout.\n\nA social movement which continues is necessarily like a machine\nin movement which accelerates its motion.  We shall therefore\nfind that the results of this mentality will become yet more\nimportant.  It is betrayed from time to time by incidents whose\ngravity is daily increasing--railway strikes, postmen's strikes,\nexplosions on board ironclads, &c.  A propos of the destruction\nof the Liberte, which cost more than two million pounds and\nslew two hundred men in the space of a minute, an ex-Minister of\nMarine, M. de Lanessan, expresses himself as follows:--\n\n''The evil that is gnawing at our fleet is the same as that which\nis devouring our army, our public administrations, our\nparliamentary system, our governmental system, and the whole\nfabric of our society.  This evil is anarchy--that is to say,\nsuch a disorder of minds and things that nothing is done as\nreason would dictate, and no one behaves as his professional or\nmoral duty should require him to behave.''\n\nOn the subject of the catastrophe of the Liberte, which\nfollowed that of the Iena, M. Felix Roussel said, in a\nspeech delivered as president of the municipal council of\nParis:--\n\n``The causes of the evil are not peculiar to our day.  The evil\nis more general, and bears a triple name: irresponsibility,\nindiscipline, and anarchy.''\n\nThese quotations, which state facts with which everyone is\nfamiliar, show that the staunchest upholders of the republican\nsystem themselves recognise the progress of social\ndisorganisation.[12]  Everyone sees it, while he is conscious of\nhis own impotence to change anything.  It results, in fact, from\nmental influences whose power is greater than that of our wills.\n\n\n\n[12] This disorder is the same in all the Government departments\nInteresting examples will be found in a report of M. Dausset to\nthe Municipal Council:--\n\n``The service of the public highways, which ought above all to be\nnoted for its rapid execution, is, on the contrary, the very type\nof red-tape, bureaucratic, and ink-slinging administration,\npossessing men and money and wasting both in tasks which are\noften useless, for lack of order, initiative, and method--in a\nword, of organisation.\n\nSpeaking then of the directors of departments, each of whom works\nas he pleases, and after his own fashion, he adds:--\n\n``These important persons completely ignore one another; they\nprepare and execute their plans without knowing anything of what\ntheir neighbours are doing; there is no one above them to group\nand co-ordinate their work.''  This is why a road is often torn\nup, repaired, and then torn up again a few days later, because\nthe departments dealing with the supply of water, gas,\nelectricity, and the sewers are mutually jealous, and never\nattempt to work together.  This anarchy and indiscipline\nnaturally cost enormous sums of money, and a private firm which\noperated in this manner would soon find itself bankrupt.\n\n\n\n3.  Universal Suffrage and its Representatives.\n\n\nAmong the dogmas of democracy perhaps the most fundamental of all\nand the most attractive is that of universal suffrage.  It gives\nthe masses the idea of equality, since for a moment at least rich\nand poor, learned and ignorant, are equal before the electoral\nurn.  The minister elbows the least of his servants, and during\nthis brief moment the power of one is as great as the others.\n\nAll Governments, including that of the Revolution, have feared\nuniversal suffrage.  At a first glance, indeed, the objections\nwhich suggests themselves are numerous.  The idea that the\nmultitude could usefully choose the men capable of governing,\nthat individuals of indifferent morality, feeble knowledge, and\nnarrow minds should possess, by the sole fact of number, a\ncertain talent for judging the candidate proposed for its\nselection is surely a shocking one.\n\nFrom a rational point of view the suffrage of numbers is to a\ncertain extent justified if we think with Pascal.\n\n``Plurality is the best way, because it is visible and has\nstrength to make itself obeyed; it is, however, the advice of the\nless able.''\n\nAs universal suffrage cannot in our times be replaced by any\nother institution, we must accept it and try to adapt it.  It is\naccordingly useless to protest against it or to repeat with the\nqueen Marie Caroline, at the time of her struggle with Napoleon:\n``Nothing is more dreadful than to govern men in this enlightened\ncentury, when every cobbler reasons and criticises the\nGovernment.''\n\nTo tell the truth, the objections are not always as great as they\nappear.  The laws of the psychology of crowds being admitted, it\nis very doubtful whether a limited suffrage would give a much\nbetter choice of men than that obtained by universal suffrage.\n\nThese same psychological laws also show us that so-called\nuniversal suffrage is in reality a pure fiction.  The crowd, save\nin very rare cases, has no opinion but that of its leaders.\nUniversal suffrage really represents the most limited of\nsuffrages.\n\nThere justly resides its real danger.  Universal suffrage is made\ndangerous by the fact that the leaders who are its masters are\nthe creatures of little local committees analogous to the clubs\nof the Revolution.  The leader who canvasses for a mandate is\nchosen by them.\n\nOnce nominated, he exercises an absolute local power, on\ncondition of satisfying the interests of his committees.  Before\nthis necessity the general interest of the country disappears\nalmost totally from the mind of the elected representative.\n\nNaturally the committees, having need of docile servants, do not\nchoose for this task individuals gifted with a lofty intelligence\nnor, above all, with a very high morality.  They must have men\nwithout character, without social position, and always docile.\n\nBy reason of these necessities the servility of the deputy in\nrespect of these little groups which patronise him, and without\nwhich he would be no one, is absolute.  He will speak and vote\njust as his committee tells him.  His political ideal may be\nexpressed in a few words: it is to obey, that he may retain his\npost.\n\nSometimes, rarely indeed, and only when by name or position or\nwealth he has a great prestige, a superior character may impose\nhimself upon the popular vote by overcoming the tyranny of the\nimpudent minorities which constitute the local committees.\n\nDemocratic countries like France are only apparently governed by\nuniversal suffrage.  For this reason is it that so many measures\nare passed which do not interest the people and which the people\nnever demanded.  Such were the purchase of the Western railways,\nthe laws respecting congregations, &c.  These absurd\nmanifestations merely translated the demands of fanatical local\ncommittees, and were imposed upon deputies whom they had chosen.\n\nWe may judge of the influence of these committees when we see\nmoderate deputies forced to patronise the anarchical\ndestroyers of arsenals, to ally themselves with anti-militarists,\nand, in a word, to obey the most atrocious demands in order to\nensure re-election.  The will of the lowest elements of democracy\nhas thus created among the elected representatives manners and a\nmorality which we can but recognise are of the lowest.  The\npolitician is the man in public employment, and as Nietzsche\nsays:--\n\n``Where public employment begins there begins also the clamour of\nthe great comedians and the buzzing of venomous flies. . . .  The\ncomedian always believes in that which makes him obtain his best\neffects, in that which impels the people to believe in him.  To-\nmorrow he will have a new faith, and the day after to-morrow yet\nanother. . . .  All that is great has its being far from public\nemployment and glory.''\n\n\n4.  The Craving for Reforms.\n\n\nThe craze for reforms imposed suddenly by means of decrees is one\nof the most disastrous conceptions of the Jacobin spirit, one of\nthe formidable legacies left by the Revolution.  It is among the\nprincipal factors of all the incessant political upheavals of the\nlast century in France.\n\nOne of the psychological causes of this intense thirst for\nreforms arises from the difficulty of determining the real causes\nof the evils complained of.  The need of explanation creates\nfictitious causes of the simplest nature.  Therefore the remedies\nalso appear simple.\n\nFor forty years we have incessantly been passing reforms, each of\nwhich is a little revolution in itself.  In spite of all these,\nor rather because of them, the French have evolved almost\nas little as any race in Europe.\n\nThe slowness of our actual evolution may be seen if we compare\nthe principal elements of our social life--commerce, industry,\n&c.--with those of other nations.  The progress of other\nnations--of the Germans especially--then appears enormous, while\nour own has been very slow.\n\nOur administrative, industrial, and commercial organisation is\nconsiderably out of date, and is no longer equal to our new\nneeds.  Our industry is not prospering; our marine is declining.\nEven in our own colonies we cannot compete with foreign\ncountries, despite the enormous pecuniary subventions accorded by\nthe State.  M. Cruppi, an ex-Minister of Commerce, has insisted\non this melancholy decline in a recent book.  Falling into the\nusual errors, he believed it easy to remedy this inferiority by\nnew laws.\n\nAll politicians share the same opinion, which is why we progress\nso slowly.  Each party is persuaded that by means of reforms all\nevils could be remedied.  This conviction results in struggles\nsuch as have made France the most divided country in the world\nand the most subject to anarchy.\n\nNo one yet seems to understand that individuals and their\nmethods, not regulations, make the value of a people.  The\nefficacious reforms are not the revolutionary reforms but the\ntrifling ameliorations of every day accumulated in course of\ntime.  The great social changes, like the great geological\nchanges, are effected by the daily addition of minute causes.\nThe economic history of Germany during the last forty\nyears proves in a striking manner the truth of this law.\n\nMany important events which seem to depend more or less on\nhazard--as battles, for example--are themselves subject to this\nlaw of the accumulation of small causes.  No doubt the decisive\nstruggle is sometimes terminated in a day or less, but many\nminute efforts, slowly accumulated, are essential to victory.  We\nhad a painful experience of this in 1870, and the Russians have\nlearned it more recently.  Barely half an hour did Admiral Togo\nneed to annihilate the Russian fleet, at the battle of Tsushima,\nwhich finally decided the fate of Japan, but thousands of little\nfactors, small and remote, determined that success.  Causes not\nless numerous engendered the defeat of the Russians--a\nbureaucracy as complicated as ours, and as irresponsible;\nlamentable material, although paid for by its weight in gold; a\nsystem of graft at every degree of the social hierarchy, and\ngeneral indifference to the interests of the country.\n\nUnhappily the progress in little things which by their total make\nup the greatness of a nation is rarely apparent, produces no\nimpression on the public, and cannot serve the interests of\npoliticians at elections.  These latter care nothing for such\nmatters, and permit the accumulation, in the countries subject to\ntheir influence, of the little successive disorganisations which\nfinally result in great downfalls.\n\n\n5.  Social Distinctions in Democracies and Democratic Ideas in\nVarious Countries.\n\n\nWhen men were divided into castes and differentiated chiefly by\nbirth, social distinctions were generally accepted as the\nconsequences of an unavoidable natural law.\n\nAs soon as the old social divisions were destroyed the\ndistinctions of the classes appeared artificial, and for that\nreason ceased to be tolerated.\n\nThe necessity of equality being theoretical, we have seen among\ndemocratic peoples the rapid development of artificial\ninequalities, permitting their possessors to make for themselves\na plainly visible supremacy.  Never was the thirst for titles and\ndecorations so general as to-day.\n\nIn really democratic countries, such as the United States, titles\nand decorations do not exert much influence, and fortune alone\ncreates distinctions.  It is only by exception that we see\nwealthy young American girls allying themselves to the old names\nof the European aristocracy.  They are then instinctively\nemploying the only means which will permit a young race to\nacquire a past that will establish its moral framework.\n\nBut in a general fashion the aristocracy that we see springing up\nin America is by no means founded on titles and decorations.\nPurely financial, it does not provoke much jealousy, because\nevery one hopes one day to form part of it.\n\nWhen, in his book on democracy in America, Toqueville spoke of\nthe general aspiration towards equality he did not realise that\nthe prophesied equality would end in the classification of men\nfounded exclusively on the number of dollars possessed by them.\nNo other exists in the United States, and it will doubtless one\nday be the same in Europe.\n\nAt present we cannot possibly regard France as a democratic\ncountry save on paper, and here we feel the necessity, already\nreferred to, of examining the various ideas which in different\ncountries are expressed by the word ``democracy.''\n\nOf truly democratic nations we can practically mention only\nEngland and the United States.  There, democracy occurs in\ndifferent forms, but the same principles are observed--notably, a\nperfect toleration of all opinions.  Religious persecutions are\nunknown.  Real superiority easily reveals itself in the various\nprofessions which any one can enter at any age if he possesses\nthe necessary capacity.  There is no barrier to individual\neffort.\n\nIn such countries men believe themselves equal because all have\nthe idea that they are free to attain the same position.  The\nworkman knows he can become foreman, and then engineer.  Forced\nto begin on the lower rungs of the ladder instead of high up the\nscale, as in France, the engineer does not regard himself as made\nof different stuff to the rest of mankind.  It is the same in all\nprofessions.  This is why the class hatred, so intense in Europe,\nis so little developed in England and America.\n\nIn France the democracy is practically non-existent save in\nspeeches.  A system of competitions and examinations, which must\nbe worked through in youth, firmly closes the door upon the\nliberal professions, and creates inimical and separate classes.\n\nThe Latin democracies are therefore purely theoretical.  The\nabsolutism of the State has replaced monarchical absolutism, but\nit is no less severe.  The aristocracy of fortune has replaced\nthat of birth, and its privileges are no less considerable.\n\nMonarchies and democracies differ far more in form than in\nsubstance.  It is only the variable mentality of men that varies\ntheir effects.  All the discussions as to various systems of\ngovernment are really of no interest, for these have no special\nvirtue of themselves.  Their value will always depend on that of\nthe people governed.  A people effects great and rapid progress\nwhen it discovers that it is the sum of the personal efforts of\neach individual and not the system of government that determines\nthe rank of a nation in the world.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE NEW FORMS OF DEMOCRATIC BELIEF\n\n1.  The Conflict between Capital and Labour.\n\nWhile our legislators are reforming and legislating at hazard,\nthe natural evolution of the world is slowly pursuing its course.\nNew interests arise, the economic competition between nation and\nnation increases in severity, the working-classes are bestirring\nthemselves, and on all sides we see the birth of formidable\nproblems which the harangues of the politicians will never\nresolve.\n\nAmong these new problems one of the most complicated will be the\nproblem of the conflict between labour and capital.  It is\nbecoming acute even in such a country of tradition as England.\nWorkingmen are ceasing to respect the collective contracts which\nformerly constituted their charter, strikes are declared for\ninsignificant motives, and unemployment and pauperism are\nattaining disquieting proportions.\n\nIn America these strikes would finally have affected all\nindustries but that the very excess of the evil created a remedy.\nDuring the last ten years the industrial leaders have organised\ngreat employers' federations, which have become powerful enough\nto force the workers to submit to arbitration.\n\nThe labour question is complicated in France by the\nintervention of numerous foreign workers, which the stagnation of\nour population has rendered necessary.[13]  This stagnation will\nalso make it difficult for France to contend with her rivals,\nwhose soil will soon no longer be able to nourish its\ninhabitants, who, following one of the oldest laws of history,\nwill necessarily invade the less densely peopled countries.\n\n\n\n[13] Population of the Great Powers:--\n                    1789.       1906.\n\nRussia  ... ...  28,000,000 129,000,000\nGermany ... ...  28,000,000  57,000,000\nAustria ... ...  18,000,000  44,000,000\nEngland ... ...  12,000,000  40,000,000\nFrance  ... ...  26,000,000  39,000,000\n\n\n\n\nThese conflicts between the workers and employers of the same\nnation will be rendered still more acute by the increasing\neconomic struggle between the Asiatics, whose needs are small,\nand who can therefore produce manufactured articles at very low\nprices, and the Europeans, whose needs are many.  For twenty-five\nyears I have laid stress upon this point.  General Hamilton, ex-\nmilitary attache to the Japanese army, who foresaw the\nJapanese victories long before the outbreak of hostilities,\nwrites as follows in an essay translated by General Langlois:--\n\n``The Chinaman, such as I have seen him in Manchuria, is capable\nof destroying the present type of worker of the white races.  He\nwill drive him off the face of the earth.  The Socialists, who\npreach equality to the labourer, are far from thinking what would\nbe the practical result of carrying out their theories.  Is it,\nthen, the destiny of the white races to disappear in the long\nrun?  In my humble opinion this destiny depends upon one\nsingle factor:  Shall we or shall we not have the good sense to\nclose our ears to speeches which present war and preparation for\nwar as a useless evil?\n\n``I believe the workers must choose.  Given the present\nconstitution of the world, they must cultivate in their children\nthe military ideal, and accept gracefully the cost and trouble\nwhich militarism entails, or they will be let in for a cruel\nstruggle for life with a rival worker of whose success there is\nnot the slightest doubt.  There is only one means of refusing\nAsiatics the right to emigrate, to lower wages by competition,\nand to live in our midst, and that is the sword.  If Americans\nand Europeans forget that their privileged position is held only\nby force of arms, Asia will soon have taken her revenge.''\n\nWe know that in America the invasion of Chinese and Japanese,\nowing to the competition between them and the workers of white\nrace, has become a national calamity.  In Europe the invasion is\ncommencing, but has not as yet gone far.  But already Chinese\nemigrants have formed important colonies in certain centres--\nLondon, Cardiff, Liverpool, &c.  They have provoked several riots\nby working for low wages.  Their appearance has always lowered\nsalaries.\n\nBut these problems belong to the future, and those of the present\nare so disquieting that it is useless at the moment to occupy\nourselves with others.\n\n\n2.  The Evolution of the Working-Classes and the Syndicalist\nMovement.\n\n\nThe most important democratic problem of the day will perhaps\nresult from the recent development of the working-class\nengendered by the Syndicalist or Trades Union movement.\n\nThe aggregation of similar interests known as Syndicalism has\nrapidly assumed such enormous developments in all countries that\nit may be called world-wide.  Certain corporations have budgets\ncomparable to those of small States.  Some German leagues have\nbeen cited as having saved over three millions sterling in\nsubscriptions.\n\nThe extension of the labour movement in all countries shows that\nit is not, like Socialism, a dream of Utopian theorists, but the\nresult of economic necessities.  In its aim, its means of action,\nand its tendencies, Syndicalism presents no kinship with\nSocialism.  Having sufficiently explained it in my Political\nPsychology, it will suffice here to recall in a few words the\ndifference between the two doctrines.\n\nSocialism would obtain possession of all industries, and have\nthem managed by the State, which would distribute the products\nequally between the citizens.  Syndicalism, on the other hand,\nwould entirely eliminate the action of the State, and divide\nsociety into small professional groups which would be\nself-governing.\n\nAlthough despised by the Syndicalists and violently attacked by\nthem, the Socialists are trying to ignore the conflict, but it is\nrapidly becoming too obvious to be concealed.  The political\ninfluence which the Socialists still possess will soon escape\nthem.\n\nIf Syndicalism is everywhere increasing at the expense of\nSocialism, it is, I repeat, because this corporative movement,\nalthough a renewal of the past, synthetises certain needs\nborn of the specialisation of modern industry.\n\nWe see its manifestations under a great variety of circumstances.\nIn France its success has not as yet been as great as elsewhere.\nHaving taken the revolutionary form already mentioned, it has\nfallen, at least for the time being, into the hands of the\nanarchists, who care as little for Syndicalism as for any sort of\norganisation, and are simply using the new doctrine in an attempt\nto destroy modern society.  Socialists, Syndicalists, and\nanarchists, although directed by entirely different conceptions,\nare thus collaborating in the same eventual aim--the violent\nsuppression of the ruling classes and the pillage of their\nwealth.\n\nThe Syndicalist doctrine does not in any way derive from the\nprinciples of Revolution.  On many points it is entirely in\ncontradiction with the Revolution.  Syndicalism represents rather\na return to certain forms of collective organisation similar to\nthe guilds or corporations proscribed by the Revolution.  It thus\nconstitutes one of those federations which the Revolution\ncondemned.  It entirely rejects the State centralisation which\nthe Revolution established.\n\nSyndicalism cares nothing for the democratic principles of\nliberty, equality, and fraternity.  The Syndicalists demand of\ntheir members an absolute discipline which eliminates all\nliberty.\n\nNot being as yet strong enough to exercise mutual tyranny, the\nsyndicates so far profess sentiments in respect of one another\nwhich might by a stretch be called fraternal.  But as soon as\nthey are sufficiently powerful, when their contrary interests\nwill necessarily enter into conflict, as during the Syndicalist\nperiod of the old Italian republics--Florence and Siena, for\nexample--the present fraternity will speedily be forgotten, and\nequality will be replaced by the despotism of the most powerful.\n\nSuch a future seems near at hand.  The new power is increasing\nvery rapidly, and finds the Governments powerless before it, able\nto defend themselves only by yielding to every demand--an odious\npolicy, which may serve for the moment, but which heavily\ncompromises the future.\n\nIt was, however, to this poor recourse that the English\nGovernment recently resorted in its struggle against the Miners'\nUnion, which threatened to suspend the industrial life of\nEngland.  The Union demanded a minimum wage for its members, but\nthey were not bound to furnish a minimum of work.\n\nAlthough such a demand was inadmissible, the Government agreed to\npropose to Parliament a law to sanction such a measure.  We may\nprofitably read the weighty words pronounced by Mr. Balfour\nbefore the House of Commons:--\n\n``The country has never in its so long and varied history had to\nface a danger of this nature and this importance.\n\n``We are confronted with the strange and sinister spectacle of a\nmere organisation threatening to paralyse--and paralysing in a\nlarge measure--the commerce and manufactures of a community which\nlives by commerce and manufacture.\n\n``The power possessed by the miners is in the present state of\nthe law almost unlimited.  Have we ever seen the like of it?  Did\never feudal baron exert a comparable tyranny?  Was there\never an American trust which served the rights which it holds\nfrom the law with such contempt of the general interest?  The\nvery degree of perfection to which we have brought our laws, our\nsocial organisation, the mutual relation between the various\nprofessions and industries, exposes us more than our predecessors\nin ruder ages to the grave peril which at present threatens\nsociety. . . .  We are witnesses at the present moment of the\nfirst manifestation of the power of elements which, if we are not\nheedful, will submerge the whole of society. . . .  The attitude\nof the Government in yielding to the injunction of the miners\ngives some appearance of reality to the victory of those who are\npitting themselves against society.''\n\n\n3.  Why certain modern Democratic Governments are gradually\nbeing transformed into Governments by Administrative Castes.\n\n\nAnarchy and the social conflicts resulting from democratic ideas\nare to-day impelling some Governments towards an unforeseen\ncourse of evolution which will end by leaving them only a nominal\npower.  This development, of which I shall briefly denote the\neffects, is effected spontaneously under the stress of those\nimperious necessities which are still the chief controlling power\nof events.\n\nThe Governments of democratic countries to-day consist of the\nrepresentatives elected by universal suffrage.  They vote laws,\nand appoint and dismiss ministers chosen from themselves, and\nprovisionally entrusted with the executive power.  These\nministers are naturally often replaced, since a vote will do\nit.  Those who follow them, belonging to a different\nparty, will govern according to different principles.\n\nIt might at first seem that a country thus pulled to and fro by\nvarious influences could have no continuity or stability.  But in\nspite of all these conditions of instability a democratic\nGovernment like that of France works with fair regularity.  How\nexplain such a phenomenon?\n\nIts interpretation, which is very simple, results from the fact\nthat the ministers who have the appearance of governing really\ngovern the country only to a very limited extent.  Strictly\nlimited and circumscribed, their power is exercised principally\nin speeches which are hardly noticed and in a few inorganic\nmeasures.\n\nBut behind the superficial authority of ministers, without force\nor duration, the playthings of every demand of the politician, an\nanonymous power is secretly at work whose might is continually\nincreasing the administrations.  Possessing traditions, a\nhierarchy, and continuity, they are a power against which, as the\nministers quickly realise, they are incapable of struggling.[14]\nResponsibility is so divided in the administrative machine that a\nminister may never find himself opposed by any person of\nimportance.  His momentary impulses are checked by a network of\nregulations, customs, and decrees, which are continually quoted\nto him, and which he knows so little that he dare not infringe\nthem.\n\n\n\n[14] The impotence of ministers in their own departments has been\nwell described by one of them, M. Cruppi, in a recent book.  The\nmost ardent wishes of the minister being immediately paralysed by\nhis department, he promptly ceases to struggle against it.\n\n\n\n\nThis diminution of the power of democratic Governments can\nonly develop.  One of the most constant laws of history is that\nof which I have already spoken:  Immediately any one class\nbecomes preponderant--nobles, clergy, army, or the people--it\nspeedily tends to enslave others.  Such were the Roman armies,\nwhich finally appointed and overthrew the emperors; such were the\nclergy, against whom the kings of old could hardly struggle; such\nwere the States General, which at the moment of Revolution\nspeedily absorbed all the powers of government, and supplanted\nthe monarchy.\n\nThe caste of functionaries is destined to furnish a fresh proof\nof the truth of this law.  Preponderant already, they are\nbeginning to speak loudly, to make threats, and even to indulge\nin strikes, such as that of the postmen, which was quickly\nfollowed by that of the Government railway employees.  The\nadministrative power thus forms a little State within the State,\nand if its present rate of revolution continues it will soon\nconstitute the only power in the State.  Under a Socialist\nGovernment there would be no other power.  All our revolutions\nwould then have resulted in stripping the king of his powers and\nhis throne in order to bestow them upon the irresponsible,\nanonymous and despotic class of Government clerks.\n\nTo foresee the issue of all the conflicts which threaten to cloud\nthe future is impossible.  We must steer clear of pessimism as of\noptimism; all we can say is that necessity will always finally\nbring things to an equilibrium.  The world pursues its way\nwithout bothering itself with our speeches, and sooner or later\nwe manage to adapt ourselves to the variations of our\nenvironment.  The difficulty is to do so without too much\nfriction, and above all to resist the chimerical conceptions of\ndreamers.  Always powerless to re-organise the world, they have\noften contrived to upset it.\n\nAthens, Rome, Florence, and many other cities which formerly\nshone in history, were victims of these terrible theorists.  The\nresults of their influence has always been the same--anarchy,\ndictatorship, and decadence.\n\nBut such lessons will not affect the numerous Catilines of the\npresent day.  They do not yet see that the movements unchained by\ntheir ambitions threaten to submerge them.  All these Utopians\nhave awakened impossible hopes in the mind of the crowd, excited\ntheir appetites, and sapped the dykes which have been slowly\nerected during the centuries to restrain them.\n\nThe struggle of the blind multitudes against the elect is one of\nthe continuous facts of history, and the triumph of popular\nsovereignties without counterpoise has already marked the end of\nmore than one civilisation.  The elect create, the plebs\ndestroys.  As soon as the first lose their hold the latter begins\nits precious work.\n\nThe great civilisations have only prospered by dominating their\nlower elements.  It is not only in Greece that anarchy,\ndictatorship, invasion, and, finally, the loss of independence\nhas resulted from the despotism of a democracy.  Individual\ntyranny is always born of collective tyranny.  It ended the first\ncycle of the greatness of Rome; the Barbarians achieved the\nsecond.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe principal revolutions of history have been studied in this\nvolume.  But we have dealt more especially with the most\nimportant of all--that which for more than twenty years\noverwhelmed all Europe, and whose echoes are still to be heard.\n\nThe French Revolution is an inexhaustible mine of psychological\ndocuments.  No period of the life of humanity has presented such\na mass of experience, accumulated in so short a time.\n\nOn each page of this great drama we have found numerous\napplications of the principles expounded in my various works,\nconcerning the transitory mentality of crowds and the permanent\nsoul of the peoples, the action of beliefs, the influence of\nmystic, affective, and collective elements, and the conflict\nbetween the various forms of logic.\n\nThe Revolutionary Assemblies illustrate all the known laws of the\npsychology of crowds.  Impulsive and timid, they are dominated by\na small number of leaders, and usually act in a sense contrary to\nthe wishes of their individual members.\n\nThe Royalist Constituent Assembly destroyed an ancient monarchy;\nthe humanitarian Legislative Assembly allowed the massacres of\nSeptember.  The same pacific body led France into the most\nformidable campaigns.\n\nThere were similar contradictions during the Convention.  The\nimmense majority of its members abhorred violence.  Sentimental\nphilosophers, they exalted equality, fraternity, and liberty, yet\nended by exerting the most terrible despotism.\n\nThe same contradictions were visible during the Directory.\nExtremely moderate in their intentions at the outset, the\nAssemblies were continually effecting bloodthirsty coups\nd'etat.  They wished to re-establish religious peace, and\nfinally sent thousands of priests into imprisonment.  They wished\nto repair the ruins which covered France, and only succeeded in\nadding to them.\n\nThus there was always a complete contradiction between the\nindividual wills of the men of the revolutionary period and the\ndeeds of the Assemblies of which they were units.\n\nThe truth is that they obeyed invisible forces of which they were\nnot the masters.  Believing that they acted in the name of pure\nreason, they were really subject to mystic, affective, and\ncollective influences, incomprehensible to them, and which we are\nonly to-day beginning to understand.\n\n\nIntelligence has progressed in the course of the ages, and has\nopened a marvellous outlook to man, although his character, the\nreal foundation of his mind, and the sure motive of his actions,\nhas scarcely changed.  Overthrown one moment, it reappears the\nnext.  Human nature must be accepted as it is.\n\nThe founders of the Revolution did not resign themselves to the\nfacts of human nature.  For the first time in the history\nof humanity they attempted to transform men and society in the\nname of reason.\n\nNever was any undertaking commenced with such chances of success.\nThe theorists, who claimed to effect it, had a power in their\nhands greater than that of any despot.\n\nYet, despite this power, despite the success of the armies,\ndespite Draconian laws and repeated coups d'etat, the\nRevolution merely heaped ruin upon ruin, and ended in a\ndictatorship.\n\nSuch an attempt was not useless, since experience is necessary to\nthe education of the peoples.  Without the Revolution it would\nhave been difficult to prove that pure reason does not enable us\nto change human nature, and, consequently, that no society can be\nrebuilt by the will of legislators, however absolute their power.\n\n\nCommenced by the middle classes for their own profit, the\nRevolution speedily became a popular movement, and at the same\ntime a struggle of the instinctive against the rational, a revolt\nagainst all the constraints which make civilisation out of\nbarbarism.  It was by relying on the principle of popular\nsovereignty that the reformers attempted to impose their\ndoctrines.  Guided by leaders, the people intervened incessantly\nin the deliberations of the Assemblies, and committed the most\nsanguinary acts of violence.\n\nThe history of the multitudes during the Revolution is eminently\ninstructive.  It shows the error of the politicians who attribute\nall the virtues to the popular soul.\n\nThe facts of the Revolution teach us, on the contrary, that a\npeople freed from social constraints, the foundations of\ncivilisation, and abandoned to its instinctive impulses, speedily\nrelapses into its ancestral savagery.  Every popular revolution\nwhich succeeds in triumphing is a temporary return to barbarism.\nIf the Commune of 1871 had lasted, it would have repeated the\nTerror.  Not having the power to kill so many people, it had to\nconfine itself to burning the principal monuments of the capital.\n\nThe Revolution represents the conflict of psychological forces\nliberated from the bonds whose function it is to restrain them.\nPopular instincts, Jacobin beliefs, ancestral influences,\nappetites, and passions unloosed, all these various influences\nengaged in a furious mutual conflict for the space of ten years,\nduring which time they soaked France in blood and covered the\nland with ruins.\n\nSeen from a distance, this seems to be the whole upshot of the\nRevolution.  There was nothing homogeneous about it.  One must\nresort to analysis before one can understand and grasp the great\ndrama and display the impulses which continually actuated its\nheroes.  In normal times we are guided by the various forms of\nlogic--rational, affective, collective, and mystic--which more or\nless perfectly balance one another.  During seasons of upheaval\nthey enter into conflict, and man is no longer himself.\n\n\nWe have by no means undervalued in this work the importance of\ncertain acquisitions of the Revolution in respect of the rights\nof the people.  But with many other historians, we are\nforced to admit that the prize gained at the cost of such ruin\nand bloodshed would have been obtained at a later date without\neffort, by the mere progress of civilisation.  For a few years\ngained, what a load of material disaster, what moral\ndisintegration!  We are still suffering as a result of the\nlatter.  These brutal pages in the book of history will take long\nto efface: they are not effaced as yet.\n\nOur young men of to-day seem to prefer action to thought.\nDisdaining the sterile dissertations of the philosophers, they\ntake no interest in vain speculation concerning matters whose\nessential nature remains unknown.\n\nAction is certainly an excellent thing, and all real progress is\na result of action, but it is only useful when properly directed.\nThe men of the Revolution were assuredly men of action, yet the\nillusions which they accepted as guides led them to disaster.\n\nAction is always hurtful when, despising realities, it professes\nviolently to change the course of events.  One cannot experiment\nwith society as with apparatus in a laboratory.  Our political\nupheavals show us what such social errors may cost.\n\nAlthough the lesson of the Revolution was extremely categorical,\nmany unpractical spirits, hallucinated by their dreams, are\nhoping to recommence it.  Socialism, the modern synthesis of this\nhope, would be a regression to lower forms of evolution, for it\nwould paralyse the greatest sources of our activity.  By\nreplacing individual initiative and responsibility by collective\ninitiative and responsibility mankind would descend several steps\non the scale of human values.\n\nThe present time is hardly favourable to such experiments.  While\ndreamers are pursuing their dreams, exciting appetites and the\npassions of the multitude, the peoples are every day arming\nthemselves more powerfully.  All feel that amid the universal\ncompetition of the present time there is no room for weak\nnations.\n\nIn the centre of Europe a formidable military Power is increasing\nin strength, and aspiring to dominate the world, in order to find\noutlets for its goods, and for an increasing population, which it\nwill soon be unable to nourish.\n\nIf we continue to shatter our cohesion by intestine struggles,\nparty rivalries, base religious persecutions, and laws which\nfetter industrial development, our part in the world will soon be\nover.  We shall have to make room for peoples more solidly knit,\nwho have been able to adapt themselves to natural necessities\ninstead of pretending to turn back upon their course.  The\npresent does not repeat the past, and the details of history are\nfull of unforeseen consequences; but in their main lines events\nare conditioned by eternal laws.\n\n\n\nINDEX\n\nAbsolute monarchy, the\nAcceleration of forces of violence\nAdministrations, real ruling forces\nAffective logic\nAffirmation, power of\nAlexander I of Russia\nAlsace loss of\nAmbition, as a motive of revolution\nAnarchy, followed by dictatorship; mental\nAncestral soul\nAncien regime, bases of the; inconveniences of; life under;\ndissolution of\nAncients, Council of\nAnti-clerical laws\nArmies, of the Republic; character of; victories of; causes of\nsuccess\nArmy, role of, in revolution; in 1789\nAssemblies, the Revolutionary; psychology of; obedient to the\nclubs; see National, Constituent, Legislative Assemblies,\nConvention, &c.\nAssignats\nAugustine, St.\nAulaud, M.\nAustria, revolution in; royalist illusions as to her attitude;\nattacks the Republic\n\nBalfour, Rt.
