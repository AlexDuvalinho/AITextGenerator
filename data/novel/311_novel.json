 "text": "BUNNER SISTERS\n\nBy Edith Wharton\n\nScribner's Magazine 60 (Oct. 1916): 439-58; 60 (Nov. 1916): 575-96.\n\n\n\n\nPART I\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nIn the days when New York's traffic moved at the pace of the drooping\nhorse-car, when society applauded Christine Nilsson at the Academy of\nMusic and basked in the sunsets of the Hudson River School on the walls\nof the National Academy of Design, an inconspicuous shop with a\nsingle show-window was intimately and favourably known to the feminine\npopulation of the quarter bordering on Stuyvesant Square.\n\nIt was a very small shop, in a shabby basement, in a side-street\nalready doomed to decline; and from the miscellaneous display behind the\nwindow-pane, and the brevity of the sign surmounting it (merely “Bunner\nSisters” in blotchy gold on a black ground) it would have been difficult\nfor the uninitiated to guess the precise nature of the business carried\non within. But that was of little consequence, since its fame was so\npurely local that the customers on whom its existence depended were\nalmost congenitally aware of the exact range of “goods” to be found at\nBunner Sisters'.\n\nThe house of which Bunner Sisters had annexed the basement was a private\ndwelling with a brick front, green shutters on weak hinges, and a\ndress-maker's sign in the window above the shop. On each side of its\nmodest three stories stood higher buildings, with fronts of brown stone,\ncracked and blistered, cast-iron balconies and cat-haunted grass-patches\nbehind twisted railings. These houses too had once been private, but now\na cheap lunchroom filled the basement of one, while the other announced\nitself, above the knotty wistaria that clasped its central balcony, as\nthe Mendoza Family Hotel. It was obvious from the chronic cluster\nof refuse-barrels at its area-gate and the blurred surface of its\ncurtainless windows, that the families frequenting the Mendoza Hotel\nwere not exacting in their tastes; though they doubtless indulged in\nas much fastidiousness as they could afford to pay for, and rather more\nthan their landlord thought they had a right to express.\n\nThese three houses fairly exemplified the general character of the\nstreet, which, as it stretched eastward, rapidly fell from shabbiness to\nsqualor, with an increasing frequency of projecting sign-boards, and of\nswinging doors that softly shut or opened at the touch of red-nosed men\nand pale little girls with broken jugs. The middle of the street was\nfull of irregular depressions, well adapted to retain the long swirls of\ndust and straw and twisted paper that the wind drove up and down its sad\nuntended length; and toward the end of the day, when traffic had been\nactive, the fissured pavement formed a mosaic of coloured hand-bills,\nlids of tomato-cans, old shoes, cigar-stumps and banana skins, cemented\ntogether by a layer of mud, or veiled in a powdering of dust, as the\nstate of the weather determined.\n\nThe sole refuge offered from the contemplation of this depressing waste\nwas the sight of the Bunner Sisters' window. Its panes were always\nwell-washed, and though their display of artificial flowers, bands of\nscalloped flannel, wire hat-frames, and jars of home-made preserves, had\nthe undefinable greyish tinge of objects long preserved in the show-case\nof a museum, the window revealed a background of orderly counters and\nwhite-washed walls in pleasant contrast to the adjoining dinginess.\n\nThe Bunner sisters were proud of the neatness of their shop and content\nwith its humble prosperity. It was not what they had once imagined it\nwould be, but though it presented but a shrunken image of their earlier\nambitions it enabled them to pay their rent and keep themselves alive\nand out of debt; and it was long since their hopes had soared higher.\n\nNow and then, however, among their greyer hours there came one not\nbright enough to be called sunny, but rather of the silvery twilight hue\nwhich sometimes ends a day of storm. It was such an hour that Ann Eliza,\nthe elder of the firm, was soberly enjoying as she sat one January\nevening in the back room which served as bedroom, kitchen and parlour\nto herself and her sister Evelina. In the shop the blinds had been drawn\ndown, the counters cleared and the wares in the window lightly covered\nwith an old sheet; but the shop-door remained unlocked till Evelina, who\nhad taken a parcel to the dyer's, should come back.\n\nIn the back room a kettle bubbled on the stove, and Ann Eliza had laid a\ncloth over one end of the centre table, and placed near the green-shaded\nsewing lamp two tea-cups, two plates, a sugar-bowl and a piece of pie.\nThe rest of the room remained in a greenish shadow which discreetly\nveiled the outline of an old-fashioned mahogany bedstead surmounted by a\nchromo of a young lady in a night-gown who clung with eloquently-rolling\neyes to a crag described in illuminated letters as the Rock of Ages;\nand against the unshaded windows two rocking-chairs and a sewing-machine\nwere silhouetted on the dusk.\n\nAnn Eliza, her small and habitually anxious face smoothed to unusual\nserenity, and the streaks of pale hair on her veined temples shining\nglossily beneath the lamp, had seated herself at the table, and was\ntying up, with her usual fumbling deliberation, a knobby object wrapped\nin paper. Now and then, as she struggled with the string, which was too\nshort, she fancied she heard the click of the shop-door, and paused\nto listen for her sister; then, as no one came, she straightened her\nspectacles and entered into renewed conflict with the parcel. In honour\nof some event of obvious importance, she had put on her double-dyed and\ntriple-turned black silk. Age, while bestowing on this garment a patine\nworthy of a Renaissance bronze, had deprived it of whatever curves the\nwearer's pre-Raphaelite figure had once been able to impress on it;\nbut this stiffness of outline gave it an air of sacerdotal state which\nseemed to emphasize the importance of the occasion.\n\nSeen thus, in her sacramental black silk, a wisp of lace turned over\nthe collar and fastened by a mosaic brooch, and her face smoothed into\nharmony with her apparel, Ann Eliza looked ten years younger than behind\nthe counter, in the heat and burden of the day. It would have been as\ndifficult to guess her approximate age as that of the black silk, for\nshe had the same worn and glossy aspect as her dress; but a faint tinge\nof pink still lingered on her cheek-bones, like the reflection of sunset\nwhich sometimes colours the west long after the day is over.\n\nWhen she had tied the parcel to her satisfaction, and laid it with\nfurtive accuracy just opposite her sister's plate, she sat down, with an\nair of obviously-assumed indifference, in one of the rocking-chairs near\nthe window; and a moment later the shop-door opened and Evelina entered.\n\nThe younger Bunner sister, who was a little taller than her elder, had\na more pronounced nose, but a weaker slope of mouth and chin. She still\npermitted herself the frivolity of waving her pale hair, and its\ntight little ridges, stiff as the tresses of an Assyrian statue,\nwere flattened under a dotted veil which ended at the tip of her\ncold-reddened nose. In her scant jacket and skirt of black cashmere she\nlooked singularly nipped and faded; but it seemed possible that under\nhappier conditions she might still warm into relative youth.\n\n“Why, Ann Eliza,” she exclaimed, in a thin voice pitched to chronic\nfretfulness, “what in the world you got your best silk on for?”\n\nAnn Eliza had risen with a blush that made her steel-browed spectacles\nincongruous.\n\n“Why, Evelina, why shouldn't I, I sh'ld like to know? Ain't it your\nbirthday, dear?” She put out her arms with the awkwardness of habitually\nrepressed emotion.\n\nEvelina, without seeming to notice the gesture, threw back the jacket\nfrom her narrow shoulders.\n\n“Oh, pshaw,” she said, less peevishly. “I guess we'd better give up\nbirthdays. Much as we can do to keep Christmas nowadays.”\n\n“You hadn't oughter say that, Evelina. We ain't so badly off as all\nthat. I guess you're cold and tired. Set down while I take the kettle\noff: it's right on the boil.”\n\nShe pushed Evelina toward the table, keeping a sideward eye on her\nsister's listless movements, while her own hands were busy with the\nkettle. A moment later came the exclamation for which she waited.\n\n“Why, Ann Eliza!” Evelina stood transfixed by the sight of the parcel\nbeside her plate.\n\nAnn Eliza, tremulously engaged in filling the teapot, lifted a look of\nhypocritical surprise.\n\n“Sakes, Evelina! What's the matter?”\n\nThe younger sister had rapidly untied the string, and drawn from\nits wrappings a round nickel clock of the kind to be bought for a\ndollar-seventy-five.\n\n“Oh, Ann Eliza, how could you?” She set the clock down, and the sisters\nexchanged agitated glances across the table.\n\n“Well,” the elder retorted, “AIN'T it your birthday?”\n\n“Yes, but--”\n\n“Well, and ain't you had to run round the corner to the Square every\nmorning, rain or shine, to see what time it was, ever since we had to\nsell mother's watch last July? Ain't you, Evelina?”\n\n“Yes, but--”\n\n“There ain't any buts. We've always wanted a clock and now we've got\none: that's all there is about it. Ain't she a beauty, Evelina?” Ann\nEliza, putting back the kettle on the stove, leaned over her sister's\nshoulder to pass an approving hand over the circular rim of the clock.\n“Hear how loud she ticks. I was afraid you'd hear her soon as you come\nin.”\n\n“No. I wasn't thinking,” murmured Evelina.\n\n“Well, ain't you glad now?” Ann Eliza gently reproached her. The rebuke\nhad no acerbity, for she knew that Evelina's seeming indifference was\nalive with unexpressed scruples.\n\n“I'm real glad, sister; but you hadn't oughter. We could have got on\nwell enough without.”\n\n“Evelina Bunner, just you sit down to your tea. I guess I know what\nI'd oughter and what I'd hadn't oughter just as well as you do--I'm old\nenough!”\n\n“You're real good, Ann Eliza; but I know you've given up something you\nneeded to get me this clock.”\n\n“What do I need, I'd like to know? Ain't I got a best black silk?” the\nelder sister said with a laugh full of nervous pleasure.\n\nShe poured out Evelina's tea, adding some condensed milk from the jug,\nand cutting for her the largest slice of pie; then she drew up her own\nchair to the table.\n\nThe two women ate in silence for a few moments before Evelina began to\nspeak again. “The clock is perfectly lovely and I don't say it ain't a\ncomfort to have it; but I hate to think what it must have cost you.”\n\n“No, it didn't, neither,” Ann Eliza retorted. “I got it dirt cheap, if\nyou want to know. And I paid for it out of a little extra work I did the\nother night on the machine for Mrs. Hawkins.”\n\n“The baby-waists?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“There, I knew it! You swore to me you'd buy a new pair of shoes with\nthat money.”\n\n“Well, and s'posin' I didn't want 'em--what then? I've patched up the\nold ones as good as new--and I do declare, Evelina Bunner, if you ask me\nanother question you'll go and spoil all my pleasure.”\n\n“Very well, I won't,” said the younger sister.\n\nThey continued to eat without farther words. Evelina yielded to her\nsister's entreaty that she should finish the pie, and poured out a\nsecond cup of tea, into which she put the last lump of sugar; and\nbetween them, on the table, the clock kept up its sociable tick.\n\n“Where'd you get it, Ann Eliza?” asked Evelina, fascinated.\n\n“Where'd you s'pose? Why, right round here, over acrost the Square, in\nthe queerest little store you ever laid eyes on. I saw it in the window\nas I was passing, and I stepped right in and asked how much it was, and\nthe store-keeper he was real pleasant about it. He was just the nicest\nman. I guess he's a German. I told him I couldn't give much, and he\nsaid, well, he knew what hard times was too. His name's Ramy--Herman\nRamy: I saw it written up over the store. And he told me he used to work\nat Tiff'ny's, oh, for years, in the clock-department, and three years\nago he took sick with some kinder fever, and lost his place, and when\nhe got well they'd engaged somebody else and didn't want him, and so he\nstarted this little store by himself. I guess he's real smart, and he\nspoke quite like an educated man--but he looks sick.”\n\nEvelina was listening with absorbed attention. In the narrow lives of\nthe two sisters such an episode was not to be under-rated.\n\n“What you say his name was?” she asked as Ann Eliza paused.\n\n“Herman Ramy.”\n\n“How old is he?”\n\n“Well, I couldn't exactly tell you, he looked so sick--but I don't\nb'lieve he's much over forty.”\n\nBy this time the plates had been cleared and the teapot emptied, and\nthe two sisters rose from the table. Ann Eliza, tying an apron over\nher black silk, carefully removed all traces of the meal; then, after\nwashing the cups and plates, and putting them away in a cupboard, she\ndrew her rocking-chair to the lamp and sat down to a heap of mending.\nEvelina, meanwhile, had been roaming about the room in search of\nan abiding-place for the clock. A rosewood what-not with ornamental\nfret-work hung on the wall beside the devout young lady in dishabille,\nand after much weighing of alternatives the sisters decided to dethrone\na broken china vase filled with dried grasses which had long stood\non the top shelf, and to put the clock in its place; the vase, after\nfarther consideration, being relegated to a small table covered with\nblue and white beadwork, which held a Bible and prayer-book, and an\nillustrated copy of Longfellow's poems given as a school-prize to their\nfather.\n\nThis change having been made, and the effect studied from every angle\nof the room, Evelina languidly put her pinking-machine on the table,\nand sat down to the monotonous work of pinking a heap of black silk\nflounces. The strips of stuff slid slowly to the floor at her side, and\nthe clock, from its commanding altitude, kept time with the dispiriting\nclick of the instrument under her fingers.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe purchase of Evelina's clock had been a more important event in the\nlife of Ann Eliza Bunner than her younger sister could divine. In the\nfirst place, there had been the demoralizing satisfaction of finding\nherself in possession of a sum of money which she need not put into the\ncommon fund, but could spend as she chose, without consulting Evelina,\nand then the excitement of her stealthy trips abroad, undertaken on the\nrare occasions when she could trump up a pretext for leaving the shop;\nsince, as a rule, it was Evelina who took the bundles to the dyer's,\nand delivered the purchases of those among their customers who were too\ngenteel to be seen carrying home a bonnet or a bundle of pinking--so\nthat, had it not been for the excuse of having to see Mrs. Hawkins's\nteething baby, Ann Eliza would hardly have known what motive to allege\nfor deserting her usual seat behind the counter.\n\nThe infrequency of her walks made them the chief events of her life.\nThe mere act of going out from the monastic quiet of the shop into the\ntumult of the streets filled her with a subdued excitement which grew\ntoo intense for pleasure as she was swallowed by the engulfing roar\nof Broadway or Third Avenue, and began to do timid battle with their\nincessant cross-currents of humanity. After a glance or two into the\ngreat show-windows she usually allowed herself to be swept back into the\nshelter of a side-street, and finally regained her own roof in a state\nof breathless bewilderment and fatigue; but gradually, as her nerves\nwere soothed by the familiar quiet of the little shop, and the click\nof Evelina's pinking-machine, certain sights and sounds would detach\nthemselves from the torrent along which she had been swept, and she\nwould devote the rest of the day to a mental reconstruction of the\ndifferent episodes of her walk, till finally it took shape in her\nthought as a consecutive and highly-coloured experience, from which, for\nweeks afterwards, she would detach some fragmentary recollection in the\ncourse of her long dialogues with her sister.\n\nBut when, to the unwonted excitement of going out, was added the\nintenser interest of looking for a present for Evelina, Ann Eliza's\nagitation, sharpened by concealment, actually preyed upon her rest;\nand it was not till the present had been given, and she had unbosomed\nherself of the experiences connected with its purchase, that she could\nlook back with anything like composure to that stirring moment of\nher life. From that day forward, however, she began to take a certain\ntranquil pleasure in thinking of Mr. Ramy's small shop, not unlike her\nown in its countrified obscurity, though the layer of dust which\ncovered its counter and shelves made the comparison only superficially\nacceptable. Still, she did not judge the state of the shop severely, for\nMr. Ramy had told her that he was alone in the world, and lone men, she\nwas aware, did not know how to deal with dust. It gave her a good deal\nof occupation to wonder why he had never married, or if, on the other\nhand, he were a widower, and had lost all his dear little children;\nand she scarcely knew which alternative seemed to make him the more\ninteresting. In either case, his life was assuredly a sad one; and she\npassed many hours in speculating on the manner in which he probably\nspent his evenings. She knew he lived at the back of his shop, for she\nhad caught, on entering, a glimpse of a dingy room with a tumbled bed;\nand the pervading smell of cold fry suggested that he probably did his\nown cooking. She wondered if he did not often make his tea with water\nthat had not boiled, and asked herself, almost jealously, who looked\nafter the shop while he went to market. Then it occurred to her as\nlikely that he bought his provisions at the same market as Evelina;\nand she was fascinated by the thought that he and her sister might\nconstantly be meeting in total unconsciousness of the link between them.\nWhenever she reached this stage in her reflexions she lifted a furtive\nglance to the clock, whose loud staccato tick was becoming a part of her\ninmost being.\n\nThe seed sown by these long hours of meditation germinated at last in\nthe secret wish to go to market some morning in Evelina's stead. As\nthis purpose rose to the surface of Ann Eliza's thoughts she shrank back\nshyly from its contemplation. A plan so steeped in duplicity had never\nbefore taken shape in her crystalline soul. How was it possible for her\nto consider such a step? And, besides, (she did not possess sufficient\nlogic to mark the downward trend of this “besides”), what excuse could\nshe make that would not excite her sister's curiosity? From this second\nquery it was an easy descent to the third: how soon could she manage to\ngo?\n\nIt was Evelina herself, who furnished the necessary pretext by awaking\nwith a sore throat on the day when she usually went to market. It was\na Saturday, and as they always had their bit of steak on Sunday the\nexpedition could not be postponed, and it seemed natural that Ann Eliza,\nas she tied an old stocking around Evelina's throat, should announce her\nintention of stepping round to the butcher's.\n\n“Oh, Ann Eliza, they'll cheat you so,” her sister wailed.\n\nAnn Eliza brushed aside the imputation with a smile, and a few minutes\nlater, having set the room to rights, and cast a last glance at the\nshop, she was tying on her bonnet with fumbling haste.\n\nThe morning was damp and cold, with a sky full of sulky clouds that\nwould not make room for the sun, but as yet dropped only an occasional\nsnow-flake. In the early light the street looked its meanest and most\nneglected; but to Ann Eliza, never greatly troubled by any untidiness\nfor which she was not responsible, it seemed to wear a singularly\nfriendly aspect.\n\nA few minutes' walk brought her to the market where Evelina made her\npurchases, and where, if he had any sense of topographical fitness, Mr.\nRamy must also deal.\n\nAnn Eliza, making her way through the outskirts of potato-barrels and\nflabby fish, found no one in the shop but the gory-aproned butcher who\nstood in the background cutting chops.\n\nAs she approached him across the tesselation of fish-scales, blood and\nsaw-dust, he laid aside his cleaver and not unsympathetically asked:\n“Sister sick?”\n\n“Oh, not very--jest a cold,” she answered, as guiltily as if Evelina's\nillness had been feigned. “We want a steak as usual, please--and my\nsister said you was to be sure to give me jest as good a cut as if it\nwas her,” she added with child-like candour.\n\n“Oh, that's all right.” The butcher picked up his weapon with a grin.\n“Your sister knows a cut as well as any of us,” he remarked.\n\nIn another moment, Ann Eliza reflected, the steak would be cut and\nwrapped up, and no choice left her but to turn her disappointed steps\ntoward home. She was too shy to try to delay the butcher by such\nconversational arts as she possessed, but the approach of a deaf old\nlady in an antiquated bonnet and mantle gave her her opportunity.\n\n“Wait on her first, please,” Ann Eliza whispered. “I ain't in any\nhurry.”\n\nThe butcher advanced to his new customer, and Ann Eliza, palpitating in\nthe back of the shop, saw that the old lady's hesitations between liver\nand pork chops were likely to be indefinitely prolonged. They were still\nunresolved when she was interrupted by the entrance of a blowsy\nIrish girl with a basket on her arm. The newcomer caused a momentary\ndiversion, and when she had departed the old lady, who was evidently as\nintolerant of interruption as a professional story-teller, insisted on\nreturning to the beginning of her complicated order, and weighing\nanew, with an anxious appeal to the butcher's arbitration, the relative\nadvantages of pork and liver. But even her hesitations, and the\nintrusion on them of two or three other customers, were of no avail,\nfor Mr. Ramy was not among those who entered the shop; and at last Ann\nEliza, ashamed of staying longer, reluctantly claimed her steak, and\nwalked home through the thickening snow.\n\nEven to her simple judgment the vanity of her hopes was plain, and in\nthe clear light that disappointment turns upon our actions she wondered\nhow she could have been foolish enough to suppose that, even if Mr. Ramy\n<i>did</i> go to that particular market, he would hit on the same day and hour\nas herself.\n\n\nThere followed a colourless week unmarked by farther incident. The old\nstocking cured Evelina's throat, and Mrs. Hawkins dropped in once or\ntwice to talk of her baby's teeth; some new orders for pinking were\nreceived, and Evelina sold a bonnet to the lady with puffed sleeves. The\nlady with puffed sleeves--a resident of “the Square,” whose name they\nhad never learned, because she always carried her own parcels home--was\nthe most distinguished and interesting figure on their horizon. She was\nyoungish, she was elegant (as the title they had given her implied), and\nshe had a sweet sad smile about which they had woven many histories; but\neven the news of her return to town--it was her first apparition\nthat year--failed to arouse Ann Eliza's interest. All the small daily\nhappenings which had once sufficed to fill the hours now appeared to her\nin their deadly insignificance; and for the first time in her long years\nof drudgery she rebelled at the dullness of her life. With Evelina such\nfits of discontent were habitual and openly proclaimed, and Ann Eliza\nstill excused them as one of the prerogatives of youth. Besides, Evelina\nhad not been intended by Providence to pine in such a narrow life: in\nthe original plan of things, she had been meant to marry and have a\nbaby, to wear silk on Sundays, and take a leading part in a Church\ncircle. Hitherto opportunity had played her false; and for all her\nsuperior aspirations and carefully crimped hair she had remained as\nobscure and unsought as Ann Eliza. But the elder sister, who had long\nsince accepted her own fate, had never accepted Evelina's. Once a\npleasant young man who taught in Sunday-school had paid the younger\nMiss Bunner a few shy visits. That was years since, and he had speedily\nvanished from their view. Whether he had carried with him any of\nEvelina's illusions, Ann Eliza had never discovered; but his attentions\nhad clad her sister in a halo of exquisite possibilities.\n\nAnn Eliza, in those days, had never dreamed of allowing herself the\nluxury of self-pity: it seemed as much a personal right of Evelina's as\nher elaborately crinkled hair. But now she began to transfer to herself\na portion of the sympathy she had so long bestowed on Evelina. She had\nat last recognized her right to set up some lost opportunities of her\nown; and once that dangerous precedent established, they began to crowd\nupon her memory.\n\nIt was at this stage of Ann Eliza's transformation that Evelina, looking\nup one evening from her work, said suddenly: “My! She's stopped.”\n\nAnn Eliza, raising her eyes from a brown merino seam, followed her\nsister's glance across the room. It was a Monday, and they always wound\nthe clock on Sundays.\n\n“Are you sure you wound her yesterday, Evelina?”\n\n“Jest as sure as I live. She must be broke. I'll go and see.”\n\nEvelina laid down the hat she was trimming, and took the clock from its\nshelf.\n\n“There--I knew it! She's wound jest as TIGHT--what you suppose's\nhappened to her, Ann Eliza?”\n\n“I dunno, I'm sure,” said the elder sister, wiping her spectacles before\nproceeding to a close examination of the clock.\n\nWith anxiously bent heads the two women shook and turned it, as though\nthey were trying to revive a living thing; but it remained unresponsive\nto their touch, and at length Evelina laid it down with a sigh.\n\n“Seems like somethin' DEAD, don't it, Ann Eliza? How still the room is!”\n\n“Yes, ain't it?”\n\n“Well, I'll put her back where she belongs,” Evelina continued, in the\ntone of one about to perform the last offices for the departed. “And I\nguess,” she added, “you'll have to step round to Mr. Ramy's to-morrow,\nand see if he can fix her.”\n\nAnn Eliza's face burned. “I--yes, I guess I'll have to,” she stammered,\nstooping to pick up a spool of cotton which had rolled to the floor. A\nsudden heart-throb stretched the seams of her flat alpaca bosom, and a\npulse leapt to life in each of her temples.\n\nThat night, long after Evelina slept, Ann Eliza lay awake in the\nunfamiliar silence, more acutely conscious of the nearness of the\ncrippled clock than when it had volubly told out the minutes. The next\nmorning she woke from a troubled dream of having carried it to Mr.\nRamy's, and found that he and his shop had vanished; and all through the\nday's occupations the memory of this dream oppressed her.\n\nIt had been agreed that Ann Eliza should take the clock to be repaired\nas soon as they had dined; but while they were still at table a\nweak-eyed little girl in a black apron stabbed with innumerable pins\nburst in on them with the cry: “Oh, Miss Bunner, for mercy's sake! Miss\nMellins has been took again.”\n\nMiss Mellins was the dress-maker upstairs, and the weak-eyed child one\nof her youthful apprentices.\n\nAnn Eliza started from her seat. “I'll come at once. Quick, Evelina, the\ncordial!”\n\nBy this euphemistic name the sisters designated a bottle of cherry\nbrandy, the last of a dozen inherited from their grandmother, which they\nkept locked in their cupboard against such emergencies. A moment later,\ncordial in hand, Ann Eliza was hurrying upstairs behind the weak-eyed\nchild.\n\nMiss Mellins' “turn” was sufficiently serious to detain Ann Eliza for\nnearly two hours, and dusk had fallen when she took up the depleted\nbottle of cordial and descended again to the shop. It was empty, as\nusual, and Evelina sat at her pinking-machine in the back room. Ann\nEliza was still agitated by her efforts to restore the dress-maker, but\nin spite of her preoccupation she was struck, as soon as she entered, by\nthe loud tick of the clock, which still stood on the shelf where she had\nleft it.\n\n“Why, she's going!” she gasped, before Evelina could question her about\nMiss Mellins. “Did she start up again by herself?”\n\n“Oh, no; but I couldn't stand not knowing what time it was, I've got so\naccustomed to having her round; and just after you went upstairs Mrs.\nHawkins dropped in, so I asked her to tend the store for a minute, and\nI clapped on my things and ran right round to Mr. Ramy's. It turned out\nthere wasn't anything the matter with her--nothin' on'y a speck of dust\nin the works--and he fixed her for me in a minute and I brought her\nright back. Ain't it lovely to hear her going again? But tell me about\nMiss Mellins, quick!”\n\nFor a moment Ann Eliza found no words. Not till she learned that she had\nmissed her chance did she understand how many hopes had hung upon\nit. Even now she did not know why she had wanted so much to see the\nclock-maker again.\n\n“I s'pose it's because nothing's ever happened to me,” she thought, with\na twinge of envy for the fate which gave Evelina every opportunity\nthat came their way. “She had the Sunday-school teacher too,” Ann\nEliza murmured to herself; but she was well-trained in the arts of\nrenunciation, and after a scarcely perceptible pause she plunged into a\ndetailed description of the dress-maker's “turn.”\n\nEvelina, when her curiosity was roused, was an insatiable questioner,\nand it was supper-time before she had come to the end of her enquiries\nabout Miss Mellins; but when the two sisters had seated themselves at\ntheir evening meal Ann Eliza at last found a chance to say: “So she on'y\nhad a speck of dust in her.”\n\nEvelina understood at once that the reference was not to Miss Mellins.\n“Yes--at least he thinks so,” she answered, helping herself as a matter\nof course to the first cup of tea.\n\n“On'y to think!” murmured Ann Eliza.\n\n“But he isn't SURE,” Evelina continued, absently pushing the teapot\ntoward her sister. “It may be something wrong with the--I forget what he\ncalled it. Anyhow, he said he'd call round and see, day after to-morrow,\nafter supper.”\n\n“Who said?” gasped Ann Eliza.\n\n“Why, Mr. Ramy, of course. I think he's real nice, Ann Eliza. And I\ndon't believe he's forty; but he DOES look sick. I guess he's pretty\nlonesome, all by himself in that store. He as much as told me so, and\nsomehow”--Evelina paused and bridled--“I kinder thought that maybe his\nsaying he'd call round about the clock was on'y just an excuse. He said\nit just as I was going out of the store. What you think, Ann Eliza?”\n\n“Oh, I don't har'ly know.” To save herself, Ann Eliza could produce\nnothing warmer.\n\n“Well, I don't pretend to be smarter than other folks,” said Evelina,\nputting a conscious hand to her hair, “but I guess Mr. Herman Ramy\nwouldn't be sorry to pass an evening here, 'stead of spending it all\nalone in that poky little place of his.”\n\nHer self-consciousness irritated Ann Eliza.\n\n“I guess he's got plenty of friends of his own,” she said, almost\nharshly.\n\n“No, he ain't, either. He's got hardly any.”\n\n“Did he tell you that too?” Even to her own ears there was a faint sneer\nin the interrogation.\n\n“Yes, he did,” said Evelina, dropping her lids with a smile. “He seemed\nto be just crazy to talk to somebody--somebody agreeable, I mean. I\nthink the man's unhappy, Ann Eliza.”\n\n“So do I,” broke from the elder sister.\n\n“He seems such an educated man, too. He was reading the paper when\nI went in. Ain't it sad to think of his being reduced to that little\nstore, after being years at Tiff'ny's, and one of the head men in their\nclock-department?”\n\n“He told you all that?”\n\n“Why, yes. I think he'd a' told me everything ever happened to him if\nI'd had the time to stay and listen. I tell you he's dead lonely, Ann\nEliza.”\n\n“Yes,” said Ann Eliza.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nTwo days afterward, Ann Eliza noticed that Evelina, before they sat down\nto supper, pinned a crimson bow under her collar; and when the meal\nwas finished the younger sister, who seldom concerned herself with the\nclearing of the table, set about with nervous haste to help Ann Eliza in\nthe removal of the dishes.\n\n“I hate to see food mussing about,” she grumbled. “Ain't it hateful\nhaving to do everything in one room?”\n\n“Oh, Evelina, I've always thought we was so comfortable,” Ann Eliza\nprotested.\n\n“Well, so we are, comfortable enough; but I don't suppose there's any\nharm in my saying I wisht we had a parlour, is there? Anyway, we might\nmanage to buy a screen to hide the bed.”\n\nAnn Eliza coloured. There was something vaguely embarrassing in\nEvelina's suggestion.\n\n“I always think if we ask for more what we have may be taken from us,”\n she ventured.\n\n“Well, whoever took it wouldn't get much,” Evelina retorted with a laugh\nas she swept up the table-cloth.\n\nA few moments later the back room was in its usual flawless order and\nthe two sisters had seated themselves near the lamp. Ann Eliza had taken\nup her sewing, and Evelina was preparing to make artificial flowers.\nThe sisters usually relegated this more delicate business to the long\nleisure of the summer months; but to-night Evelina had brought out the\nbox which lay all winter under the bed, and spread before her a bright\narray of muslin petals, yellow stamens and green corollas, and a tray of\nlittle implements curiously suggestive of the dental art. Ann Eliza made\nno remark on this unusual proceeding; perhaps she guessed why, for that\nevening her sister had chosen a graceful task.\n\nPresently a knock on the outer door made them look up; but Evelina, the\nfirst on her feet, said promptly: “Sit still. I'll see who it is.”\n\nAnn Eliza was glad to sit still: the baby's petticoat that she was\nstitching shook in her fingers.\n\n“Sister, here's Mr. Ramy come to look at the clock,” said Evelina, a\nmoment later, in the high drawl she cultivated before strangers; and\na shortish man with a pale bearded face and upturned coat-collar came\nstiffly into the room.\n\nAnn Eliza let her work fall as she stood up. “You're very welcome, I'm\nsure, Mr. Ramy. It's real kind of you to call.”\n\n“Nod ad all, ma'am.” A tendency to illustrate Grimm's law in the\ninterchange of his consonants betrayed the clockmaker's nationality, but\nhe was evidently used to speaking English, or at least the particular\nbranch of the vernacular with which the Bunner sisters were familiar.\n“I don't like to led any clock go out of my store without being sure it\ngives satisfaction,” he added.\n\n“Oh--but we were satisfied,” Ann Eliza assured him.\n\n“But I wasn't, you see, ma'am,” said Mr. Ramy looking slowly about the\nroom, “nor I won't be, not till I see that clock's going all right.”\n\n“May I assist you off with your coat, Mr. Ramy?” Evelina interposed. She\ncould never trust Ann Eliza to remember these opening ceremonies.\n\n“Thank you, ma'am,” he replied, and taking his thread-bare over-coat and\nshabby hat she laid them on a chair with the gesture she imagined the\nlady with the puffed sleeves might make use of on similar occasions.\nAnn Eliza's social sense was roused, and she felt that the next act\nof hospitality must be hers. “Won't you suit yourself to a seat?” she\nsuggested. “My sister will reach down the clock; but I'm sure she's all\nright again. She's went beautiful ever since you fixed her.”\n\n“Dat's good,” said Mr. Ramy. His lips parted in a smile which showed a\nrow of yellowish teeth with one or two gaps in it; but in spite of this\ndisclosure Ann Eliza thought his smile extremely pleasant: there was\nsomething wistful and conciliating in it which agreed with the pathos\nof his sunken cheeks and prominent eyes. As he took the lamp, the light\nfell on his bulging forehead and wide skull thinly covered with grayish\nhair. His hands were pale and broad, with knotty joints and square\nfinger-tips rimmed with grime; but his touch was as light as a woman's.\n\n“Well, ladies, dat clock's all right,” he pronounced.\n\n“I'm sure we're very much obliged to you,” said Evelina, throwing a\nglance at her sister.\n\n“Oh,” Ann Eliza murmured, involuntarily answering the admonition.\nShe selected a key from the bunch that hung at her waist with her\ncutting-out scissors, and fitting it into the lock of the cupboard,\nbrought out the cherry brandy and three old-fashioned glasses engraved\nwith vine-wreaths.\n\n“It's a very cold night,” she said, “and maybe you'd like a sip of this\ncordial. It was made a great while ago by our grandmother.”\n\n“It looks fine,” said Mr. Ramy bowing, and Ann Eliza filled the glasses.\nIn her own and Evelina's she poured only a few drops, but she filled\ntheir guest's to the brim. “My sister and I seldom take wine,” she\nexplained.\n\nWith another bow, which included both his hostesses, Mr. Ramy drank off\nthe cherry brandy and pronounced it excellent.\n\nEvelina meanwhile, with an assumption of industry intended to put\ntheir guest at ease, had taken up her instruments and was twisting a\nrose-petal into shape.\n\n“You make artificial flowers, I see, ma'am,” said Mr. Ramy with\ninterest. “It's very pretty work. I had a lady-vriend in Shermany dat\nused to make flowers.” He put out a square finger-tip to touch the\npetal.\n\nEvelina blushed a little. “You left Germany long ago, I suppose?”\n\n“Dear me yes, a goot while ago. I was only ninedeen when I come to the\nStates.”\n\nAfter this the conversation dragged on intermittently till Mr. Ramy,\npeering about the room with the short-sighted glance of his race, said\nwith an air of interest: “You're pleasantly fixed here; it looks real\ncosy.” The note of wistfulness in his voice was obscurely moving to Ann\nEliza.\n\n“Oh, we live very plainly,” said Evelina, with an affectation of\ngrandeur deeply impressive to her sister. “We have very simple tastes.”\n\n“You look real comfortable, anyhow,” said Mr. Ramy. His bulging eyes\nseemed to muster the details of the scene with a gentle envy. “I wisht\nI had as good a store; but I guess no blace seems home-like when you're\nalways alone in it.”\n\nFor some minutes longer the conversation moved on at this desultory\npace, and then Mr. Ramy, who had been obviously nerving himself for\nthe difficult act of departure, took his leave with an abruptness\nwhich would have startled anyone used to the subtler gradations\nof intercourse. But to Ann Eliza and her sister there was nothing\nsurprising in his abrupt retreat. The long-drawn agonies of preparing to\nleave, and the subsequent dumb plunge through the door, were so usual in\ntheir circle that they would have been as much embarrassed as Mr. Ramy\nif he had tried to put any fluency into his adieux.\n\nAfter he had left both sisters remained silent for a while; then\nEvelina, laying aside her unfinished flower, said: “I'll go and lock\nup.”\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nIntolerably monotonous seemed now to the Bunner sisters the treadmill\nroutine of the shop, colourless and long their evenings about the lamp,\naimless their habitual interchange of words to the weary accompaniment\nof the sewing and pinking machines.\n\nIt was perhaps with the idea of relieving the tension of their mood\nthat Evelina, the following Sunday, suggested inviting Miss Mellins to\nsupper. The Bunner sisters were not in a position to be lavish of the\nhumblest hospitality, but two or three times in the year they shared\ntheir evening meal with a friend; and Miss Mellins, still flushed with\nthe importance of her “turn,” seemed the most interesting guest they\ncould invite.\n\nAs the three women seated themselves at the supper-table, embellished by\nthe unwonted addition of pound cake and sweet pickles, the dress-maker's\nsharp swarthy person stood out vividly between the neutral-tinted\nsisters. Miss Mellins was a small woman with a glossy yellow face and\na frizz of black hair bristling with imitation tortoise-shell pins. Her\nsleeves had a fashionable cut, and half a dozen metal bangles rattled\non her wrists. Her voice rattled like her bangles as she poured forth a\nstream of anecdote and ejaculation; and her round black eyes jumped with\nacrobatic velocity from one face to another. Miss Mellins was always\nhaving or hearing of amazing adventures. She had surprised a burglar in\nher room at midnight (though how he got there, what he robbed her\nof, and by what means he escaped had never been quite clear to her\nauditors); she had been warned by anonymous letters that her grocer (a\nrejected suitor) was putting poison in her tea; she had a customer who\nwas shadowed by detectives, and another (a very wealthy lady) who\nhad been arrested in a department store for kleptomania; she had been\npresent at a spiritualist seance where an old gentleman had died in a\nfit on seeing a materialization of his mother-in-law; she had escaped\nfrom two fires in her night-gown, and at the funeral of her first cousin\nthe horses attached to the hearse had run away and smashed the coffin,\nprecipitating her relative into an open man-hole before the eyes of his\ndistracted family.\n\nA sceptical observer might have explained Miss Mellins's proneness to\nadventure by the fact that she derived her chief mental nourishment from\nthe Police Gazette and the Fireside Weekly; but her lot was cast in a\ncircle where such insinuations were not likely to be heard, and where\nthe title-role in blood-curdling drama had long been her recognized\nright.\n\n“Yes,” she was now saying, her emphatic eyes on Ann Eliza, “you may not\nbelieve it, Miss Bunner, and I don't know's I should myself if anybody\nelse was to tell me, but over a year before ever I was born, my mother\nshe went to see a gypsy fortune-teller that was exhibited in a tent on\nthe Battery with the green-headed lady, though her father warned her\nnot to--and what you s'pose she told her? Why, she told her these very\nwords--says she: 'Your next child'll be a girl with jet-black curls, and\nshe'll suffer from spasms.'”\n\n“Mercy!” murmured Ann Eliza, a ripple of sympathy running down her\nspine.\n\n“D'you ever have spasms before, Miss Mellins?” Evelina asked.\n\n“Yes, ma'am,” the dress-maker declared. “And where'd you suppose I had\n'em? Why, at my cousin Emma McIntyre's wedding, her that married the\napothecary over in Jersey City, though her mother appeared to her in a\ndream and told her she'd rue the day she done it, but as Emma said,\nshe got more advice than she wanted from the living, and if she was to\nlisten to spectres too she'd never be sure what she'd ought to do and\nwhat she'd oughtn't; but I will say her husband took to drink, and she\nnever was the same woman after her fust baby--well, they had an elegant\nchurch wedding, and what you s'pose I saw as I was walkin' up the aisle\nwith the wedding percession?”\n\n“Well?” Ann Eliza whispered, forgetting to thread her needle.\n\n“Why, a coffin, to be sure, right on the top step of the chancel--Emma's\nfolks is 'piscopalians and she would have a church wedding, though HIS\nmother raised a terrible rumpus over it--well, there it set, right in\nfront of where the minister stood that was going to marry 'em, a coffin\ncovered with a black velvet pall with a gold fringe, and a 'Gates Ajar'\nin white camellias atop of it.”\n\n“Goodness,” said Evelina, starting, “there's a knock!”\n\n“Who can it be?” shuddered Ann Eliza, still under the spell of Miss\nMellins's hallucination.\n\nEvelina rose and lit a candle to guide her through the shop. They heard\nher turn the key of the outer door, and a gust of night air stirred the\nclose atmosphere of the back room; then there was a sound of vivacious\nexclamations, and Evelina returned with Mr. Ramy.\n\nAnn Eliza's heart rocked like a boat in a heavy sea, and the\ndress-maker's eyes, distended with curiosity, sprang eagerly from face\nto face.\n\n“I just thought I'd call in again,” said Mr. Ramy, evidently somewhat\ndisconcerted by the presence of Miss Mellins. “Just to see how the\nclock's behaving,” he added with his hollow-cheeked smile.\n\n“Oh, she's behaving beautiful,” said Ann Eliza; “but we're real glad to\nsee you all the same. Miss Mellins, let me make you acquainted with Mr.\nRamy.”\n\nThe dress-maker tossed back her head and dropped her lids in\ncondescending recognition of the stranger's presence; and Mr. Ramy\nresponded by an awkward bow. After the first moment of constraint a\nrenewed sense of satisfaction filled the consciousness of the three\nwomen. The Bunner sisters were not sorry to let Miss Mellins see that\nthey received an occasional evening visit, and Miss Mellins was clearly\nenchanted at the opportunity of pouring her latest tale into a new ear.\nAs for Mr. Ramy, he adjusted himself to the situation with greater ease\nthan might have been expected, and Evelina, who had been sorry that he\nshould enter the room while the remains of supper still lingered on\nthe table, blushed with pleasure at his good-humored offer to help her\n“glear away.”\n\nThe table cleared, Ann Eliza suggested a game of cards; and it was after\neleven o'clock when Mr. Ramy rose to take leave. His adieux were so much\nless abrupt than on the occasion of his first visit that Evelina was\nable to satisfy her sense of etiquette by escorting him, candle in hand,\nto the outer door; and as the two disappeared into the shop Miss Mellins\nplayfully turned to Ann Eliza.\n\n“Well, well, Miss Bunner,” she murmured, jerking her chin in the\ndirection of the retreating figures, “I'd no idea your sister was\nkeeping company. On'y to think!”\n\nAnn Eliza, roused from a state of dreamy beatitude, turned her timid\neyes on the dress-maker.\n\n“Oh, you're mistaken, Miss Mellins. We don't har'ly know Mr. Ramy.”\n\nMiss Mellins smiled incredulously. “You go 'long, Miss Bunner. I guess\nthere'll be a wedding somewheres round here before spring, and I'll be\nreal offended if I ain't asked to make the dress. I've always seen her\nin a gored satin with rooshings.”\n\nAnn Eliza made no answer. She had grown very pale, and her eyes lingered\nsearchingly on Evelina as the younger sister re-entered the room.\nEvelina's cheeks were pink, and her blue eyes glittered; but it seemed\nto Ann Eliza that the coquettish tilt of her head regrettably emphasized\nthe weakness of her receding chin. It was the first time that Ann\nEliza had ever seen a flaw in her sister's beauty, and her involuntary\ncriticism startled her like a secret disloyalty.\n\nThat night, after the light had been put out, the elder sister knelt\nlonger than usual at her prayers. In the silence of the darkened\nroom she was offering up certain dreams and aspirations whose brief\nblossoming had lent a transient freshness to her days. She wondered\nnow how she could ever have supposed that Mr. Ramy's visits had another\ncause than the one Miss Mellins suggested. Had not the sight of Evelina\nfirst inspired him with a sudden solicitude for the welfare of the\nclock? And what charms but Evelina's could have induced him to repeat\nhis visit? Grief held up its torch to the frail fabric of Ann Eliza's\nillusions, and with a firm heart she watched them shrivel into ashes;\nthen, rising from her knees full of the chill joy of renunciation, she\nlaid a kiss on the crimping pins of the sleeping Evelina and crept under\nthe bedspread at her side.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nDuring the months that followed, Mr. Ramy visited the sisters with\nincreasing frequency. It became his habit to call on them every Sunday\nevening, and occasionally during the week he would find an excuse for\ndropping in unannounced as they were settling down to their work beside\nthe lamp. Ann Eliza noticed that Evelina now took the precaution of\nputting on her crimson bow every evening before supper, and that she\nhad refurbished with a bit of carefully washed lace the black silk\nwhich they still called new because it had been bought a year after Ann\nEliza's.\n\nMr. Ramy, as he grew more intimate, became less conversational, and\nafter the sisters had blushingly accorded him the privilege of a pipe he\nbegan to permit himself long stretches of meditative silence that\nwere not without charm to his hostesses. There was something at once\nfortifying and pacific in the sense of that tranquil male presence in\nan atmosphere which had so long quivered with little feminine doubts and\ndistresses; and the sisters fell into the habit of saying to each other,\nin moments of uncertainty: “We'll ask Mr. Ramy when he comes,” and of\naccepting his verdict, whatever it might be, with a fatalistic readiness\nthat relieved them of all responsibility.\n\nWhen Mr. Ramy drew the pipe from his mouth and became, in his turn,\nconfidential, the acuteness of their sympathy grew almost painful to the\nsisters. With passionate participation they listened to the story of his\nearly struggles in Germany, and of the long illness which had been the\ncause of his recent misfortunes. The name of the Mrs. Hochmuller (an old\ncomrade's widow) who had nursed him through his fever was greeted with\nreverential sighs and an inward pang of envy whenever it recurred in his\nbiographical monologues, and once when the sisters were alone Evelina\ncalled a responsive flush to Ann Eliza's brow by saying suddenly,\nwithout the mention of any name: “I wonder what she's like?”\n\nOne day toward spring Mr. Ramy, who had by this time become as much a\npart of their lives as the letter-carrier or the milkman, ventured the\nsuggestion that the ladies should accompany him to an exhibition of\nstereopticon views which was to take place at Chickering Hall on the\nfollowing evening.\n\nAfter their first breathless “Oh!” of pleasure there was a silence\nof mutual consultation, which Ann Eliza at last broke by saying: “You\nbetter go with Mr. Ramy, Evelina. I guess we don't both want to leave\nthe store at night.”\n\nEvelina, with such protests as politeness demanded, acquiesced in this\nopinion, and spent the next day in trimming a white chip bonnet with\nforget-me-nots of her own making. Ann Eliza brought out her mosaic\nbrooch, a cashmere scarf of their mother's was taken from its linen\ncerements, and thus adorned Evelina blushingly departed with Mr. Ramy,\nwhile the elder sister sat down in her place at the pinking-machine.\n\nIt seemed to Ann Eliza that she was alone for hours, and she was\nsurprised, when she heard Evelina tap on the door, to find that the\nclock marked only half-past ten.\n\n“It must have gone wrong again,” she reflected as she rose to let her\nsister in.\n\nThe evening had been brilliantly interesting, and several striking\nstereopticon views of Berlin had afforded Mr. Ramy the opportunity of\nenlarging on the marvels of his native city.\n\n“He said he'd love to show it all to me!” Evelina declared as Ann Eliza\nconned her glowing face. “Did you ever hear anything so silly? I didn't\nknow which way to look.”\n\nAnn Eliza received this confidence with a sympathetic murmur.\n\n“My bonnet IS becoming, isn't it?” Evelina went on irrelevantly, smiling\nat her reflection in the cracked glass above the chest of drawers.\n\n“You're jest lovely,” said Ann Eliza.\n\n\nSpring was making itself unmistakably known to the distrustful New\nYorker by an increased harshness of wind and prevalence of dust, when\none day Evelina entered the back room at supper-time with a cluster of\njonquils in her hand.\n\n“I was just that foolish,” she answered Ann Eliza's wondering glance, “I\ncouldn't help buyin' 'em. I felt as if I must have something pretty to\nlook at right away.”\n\n“Oh, sister,” said Ann Eliza, in trembling sympathy. She felt that\nspecial indulgence must be conceded to those in Evelina's state since\nshe had had her own fleeting vision of such mysterious longings as the\nwords betrayed.\n\nEvelina, meanwhile, had taken the bundle of dried grasses out of the\nbroken china vase, and was putting the jonquils in their place with\ntouches that lingered down their smooth stems and blade-like leaves.\n\n“Ain't they pretty?” she kept repeating as she gathered the flowers into\na starry circle. “Seems as if spring was really here, don't it?”\n\nAnn Eliza remembered that it was Mr. Ramy's evening.\n\nWhen he came, the Teutonic eye for anything that blooms made him turn at\nonce to the jonquils.\n\n“Ain't dey pretty?” he said. “Seems like as if de spring was really\nhere.”\n\n“Don't it?” Evelina exclaimed, thrilled by the coincidence of their\nthought. “It's just what I was saying to my sister.”\n\nAnn Eliza got up suddenly and moved away; she remembered that she had\nnot wound the clock the day before. Evelina was sitting at the table;\nthe jonquils rose slenderly between herself and Mr. Ramy.\n\n“Oh,” she murmured with vague eyes, “how I'd love to get away somewheres\ninto the country this very minute--somewheres where it was green and\nquiet. Seems as if I couldn't stand the city another day.” But Ann Eliza\nnoticed that she was looking at Mr. Ramy, and not at the flowers.\n\n“I guess we might go to Cendral Park some Sunday,” their visitor\nsuggested. “Do you ever go there, Miss Evelina?”\n\n“No, we don't very often; leastways we ain't been for a good while.” She\nsparkled at the prospect. “It would be lovely, wouldn't it, Ann Eliza?”\n\n“Why, yes,” said the elder sister, coming back to her seat.\n\n“Well, why don't we go next Sunday?” Mr. Ramy continued. “And we'll\ninvite Miss Mellins too--that'll make a gosy little party.”\n\nThat night when Evelina undressed she took a jonquil from the vase\nand pressed it with a certain ostentation between the leaves of her\nprayer-book. Ann Eliza, covertly observing her, felt that Evelina was\nnot sorry to be observed, and that her own acute consciousness of the\nact was somehow regarded as magnifying its significance.\n\nThe following Sunday broke blue and warm. The Bunner sisters were\nhabitual church-goers, but for once they left their prayer-books on the\nwhat-not, and ten o'clock found them, gloved and bonneted, awaiting Miss\nMellins's knock. Miss Mellins presently appeared in a glitter of jet\nsequins and spangles, with a tale of having seen a strange man prowling\nunder her windows till he was called off at dawn by a confederate's\nwhistle; and shortly afterward came Mr. Ramy, his hair brushed with more\nthan usual care, his broad hands encased in gloves of olive-green kid.\n\nThe little party set out for the nearest street-car, and a flutter of\nmingled gratification and embarrassment stirred Ann Eliza's bosom when\nit was found that Mr. Ramy intended to pay their fares. Nor did he fail\nto live up to this opening liberality; for after guiding them through\nthe Mall and the Ramble he led the way to a rustic restaurant where,\nalso at his expense, they fared idyllically on milk and lemon-pie.\n\nAfter this they resumed their walk, strolling on with the slowness of\nunaccustomed holiday-makers from one path to another--through budding\nshrubberies, past grass-banks sprinkled with lilac crocuses, and under\nrocks on which the forsythia lay like sudden sunshine. Everything about\nher seemed new and miraculously lovely to Ann Eliza; but she kept her\nfeelings to herself, leaving it to Evelina to exclaim at the hepaticas\nunder the shady ledges, and to Miss Mellins, less interested in the\nvegetable than in the human world, to remark significantly on the\nprobable history of the persons they met. All the alleys were thronged\nwith promenaders and obstructed by perambulators; and Miss Mellins's\nrunning commentary threw a glare of lurid possibilities over the placid\nfamily groups and their romping progeny.\n\nAnn Eliza was in no mood for such interpretations of life; but, knowing\nthat Miss Mellins had been invited for the sole purpose of keeping her\ncompany she continued to cling to the dress-maker's side, letting\nMr. Ramy lead the way with Evelina. Miss Mellins, stimulated by the\nexcitement of the occasion, grew more and more discursive, and\nher ceaseless talk, and the kaleidoscopic whirl of the crowd, were\nunspeakably bewildering to Ann Eliza. Her feet, accustomed to the\nslippered ease of the shop, ached with the unfamiliar effort of walking,\nand her ears with the din of the dress-maker's anecdotes; but every\nnerve in her was aware of Evelina's enjoyment, and she was determined\nthat no weariness of hers should curtail it. Yet even her heroism shrank\nfrom the significant glances which Miss Mellins presently began to\ncast at the couple in front of them: Ann Eliza could bear to connive at\nEvelina's bliss, but not to acknowledge it to others.\n\nAt length Evelina's feet also failed her, and she turned to suggest\nthat they ought to be going home. Her flushed face had grown pale with\nfatigue, but her eyes were radiant.\n\nThe return lived in Ann Eliza's memory with the persistence of an evil\ndream. The horse-cars were packed with the returning throng, and they\nhad to let a dozen go by before they could push their way into one that\nwas already crowded. Ann Eliza had never before felt so tired. Even Miss\nMellins's flow of narrative ran dry, and they sat silent, wedged between\na negro woman and a pock-marked man with a bandaged head, while the car\nrumbled slowly down a squalid avenue to their corner. Evelina and Mr.\nRamy sat together in the forward part of the car, and Ann Eliza could\ncatch only an occasional glimpse of the forget-me-not bonnet and the\nclock-maker's shiny coat-collar; but when the little party got out at\ntheir corner the crowd swept them together again, and they walked back\nin the effortless silence of tired children to the Bunner sisters'\nbasement. As Miss Mellins and Mr. Ramy turned to go their various ways\nEvelina mustered a last display of smiles; but Ann Eliza crossed the\nthreshold in silence, feeling the stillness of the little shop reach out\nto her like consoling arms.\n\nThat night she could not sleep; but as she lay cold and rigid at her\nsister's side, she suddenly felt the pressure of Evelina's arms, and\nheard her whisper: “Oh, Ann Eliza, warn't it heavenly?”\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nFor four days after their Sunday in the Park the Bunner sisters had no\nnews of Mr. Ramy. At first neither one betrayed her disappointment and\nanxiety to the other; but on the fifth morning Evelina, always the first\nto yield to her feelings, said, as she turned from her untasted tea: “I\nthought you'd oughter take that money out by now, Ann Eliza.”\n\nAnn Eliza understood and reddened. The winter had been a fairly\nprosperous one for the sisters, and their slowly accumulated savings\nhad now reached the handsome sum of two hundred dollars; but the\nsatisfaction they might have felt in this unwonted opulence had been\nclouded by a suggestion of Miss Mellins's that there were dark rumours\nconcerning the savings bank in which their funds were deposited. They\nknew Miss Mellins was given to vain alarms; but her words, by the sheer\nforce of repetition, had so shaken Ann Eliza's peace that after long\nhours of midnight counsel the sisters had decided to advise with\nMr. Ramy; and on Ann Eliza, as the head of the house, this duty\nhad devolved. Mr. Ramy, when consulted, had not only confirmed the\ndress-maker's report, but had offered to find some safe investment which\nshould give the sisters a higher rate of interest than the suspected\nsavings bank; and Ann Eliza knew that Evelina alluded to the suggested\ntransfer.\n\n“Why, yes, to be sure,” she agreed. “Mr. Ramy said if he was us he\nwouldn't want to leave his money there any longer'n he could help.”\n\n“It was over a week ago he said it,” Evelina reminded her.\n\n“I know; but he told me to wait till he'd found out for sure about that\nother investment; and we ain't seen him since then.”\n\nAnn Eliza's words released their secret fear. “I wonder what's happened\nto him,” Evelina said. “You don't suppose he could be sick?”\n\n“I was wondering too,” Ann Eliza rejoined; and the sisters looked down\nat their plates.\n\n“I should think you'd oughter do something about that money pretty\nsoon,” Evelina began again.\n\n“Well, I know I'd oughter. What would you do if you was me?”\n\n“If I was YOU,” said her sister, with perceptible emphasis and a rising\nblush, “I'd go right round and see if Mr. Ramy was sick. YOU could.”\n\nThe words pierced Ann Eliza like a blade. “Yes, that's so,” she said.\n\n“It would only seem friendly, if he really IS sick. If I was you I'd go\nto-day,” Evelina continued; and after dinner Ann Eliza went.\n\nOn the way she had to leave a parcel at the dyer's, and having performed\nthat errand she turned toward Mr. Ramy's shop. Never before had she felt\nso old, so hopeless and humble. She knew she was bound on a love-errand\nof Evelina's, and the knowledge seemed to dry the last drop of young\nblood in her veins. It took from her, too, all her faded virginal\nshyness; and with a brisk composure she turned the handle of the\nclock-maker's door.\n\nBut as she entered her heart began to tremble, for she saw Mr. Ramy, his\nface hidden in his hands, sitting behind the counter in an attitude of\nstrange dejection. At the click of the latch he looked up slowly, fixing\na lustreless stare on Ann Eliza. For a moment she thought he did not\nknow her.\n\n“Oh, you're sick!” she exclaimed; and the sound of her voice seemed to\nrecall his wandering senses.\n\n“Why, if it ain't Miss Bunner!” he said, in a low thick tone; but he\nmade no attempt to move, and she noticed that his face was the colour of\nyellow ashes.\n\n“You ARE sick,” she persisted, emboldened by his evident need of help.\n“Mr. Ramy, it was real unfriendly of you not to let us know.”\n\nHe continued to look at her with dull eyes. “I ain't been sick,” he\nsaid. “Leastways not very: only one of my old turns.” He spoke in a slow\nlaboured way, as if he had difficulty in getting his words together.\n\n“Rheumatism?” she ventured, seeing how unwillingly he seemed to move.\n\n“Well--somethin' like, maybe. I couldn't hardly put a name to it.”\n\n“If it WAS anything like rheumatism, my grandmother used to make a\ntea--” Ann Eliza began: she had forgotten, in the warmth of the moment,\nthat she had only come as Evelina's messenger.\n\nAt the mention of tea an expression of uncontrollable repugnance passed\nover Mr. Ramy's face. “Oh, I guess I'm getting on all right. I've just\ngot a headache to-day.”\n\nAnn Eliza's courage dropped at the note of refusal in his voice.\n\n“I'm sorry,” she said gently. “My sister and me'd have been glad to do\nanything we could for you.”\n\n“Thank you kindly,” said Mr. Ramy wearily; then, as she turned to the\ndoor, he added with an effort: “Maybe I'll step round to-morrow.”\n\n“We'll be real glad,” Ann Eliza repeated. Her eyes were fixed on a dusty\nbronze clock in the window. She was unaware of looking at it at\nthe time, but long afterward she remembered that it represented a\nNewfoundland dog with his paw on an open book.\n\nWhen she reached home there was a purchaser in the shop, turning over\nhooks and eyes under Evelina's absent-minded supervision. Ann Eliza\npassed hastily into the back room, but in an instant she heard her\nsister at her side.\n\n“Quick! I told her I was goin' to look for some smaller hooks--how is\nhe?” Evelina gasped.\n\n“He ain't been very well,” said Ann Eliza slowly, her eyes on Evelina's\neager face; “but he says he'll be sure to be round to-morrow night.”\n\n“He will? Are you telling me the truth?”\n\n“Why, Evelina Bunner!”\n\n“Oh, I don't care!” cried the younger recklessly, rushing back into the\nshop.\n\nAnn Eliza stood burning with the shame of Evelina's self-exposure. She\nwas shocked that, even to her, Evelina should lay bare the nakedness of\nher emotion; and she tried to turn her thoughts from it as though its\nrecollection made her a sharer in her sister's debasement.\n\nThe next evening, Mr. Ramy reappeared, still somewhat sallow and\nred-lidded, but otherwise his usual self. Ann Eliza consulted him about\nthe investment he had recommended, and after it had been settled that he\nshould attend to the matter for her he took up the illustrated volume of\nLongfellow--for, as the sisters had learned, his culture soared beyond\nthe newspapers--and read aloud, with a fine confusion of consonants, the\npoem on “Maidenhood.” Evelina lowered her lids while he read. It was a\nvery beautiful evening, and Ann Eliza thought afterward how different\nlife might have been with a companion who read poetry like Mr. Ramy.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nDuring the ensuing weeks Mr. Ramy, though his visits were as frequent as\never, did not seem to regain his usual spirits. He complained frequently\nof headache, but rejected Ann Eliza's tentatively proffered remedies,\nand seemed to shrink from any prolonged investigation of his symptoms.\nJuly had come, with a sudden ardour of heat, and one evening, as the\nthree sat together by the open window in the back room, Evelina said:\n“I dunno what I wouldn't give, a night like this, for a breath of real\ncountry air.”\n\n“So would I,” said Mr. Ramy, knocking the ashes from his pipe. “I'd like\nto be setting in an arbour dis very minute.”\n\n“Oh, wouldn't it be lovely?”\n\n“I always think it's real cool here--we'd be heaps hotter up where Miss\nMellins is,” said Ann Eliza.\n\n“Oh, I daresay--but we'd be heaps cooler somewhere else,” her sister\nsnapped: she was not infrequently exasperated by Ann Eliza's furtive\nattempts to mollify Providence.\n\nA few days later Mr. Ramy appeared with a suggestion which enchanted\nEvelina. He had gone the day before to see his friend, Mrs. Hochmuller,\nwho lived in the outskirts of Hoboken, and Mrs. Hochmuller had proposed\nthat on the following Sunday he should bring the Bunner sisters to spend\nthe day with her.\n\n“She's got a real garden, you know,” Mr. Ramy explained, “wid trees and\na real summer-house to set in; and hens and chickens too. And it's an\nelegant sail over on de ferry-boat.”\n\nThe proposal drew no response from Ann Eliza. She was still oppressed by\nthe recollection of her interminable Sunday in the Park; but, obedient\nto Evelina's imperious glance, she finally faltered out an acceptance.\n\nThe Sunday was a very hot one, and once on the ferry-boat Ann Eliza\nrevived at the touch of the salt breeze, and the spectacle of the\ncrowded waters; but when they reached the other shore, and stepped out\non the dirty wharf, she began to ache with anticipated weariness. They\ngot into a street-car, and were jolted from one mean street to another,\ntill at length Mr. Ramy pulled the conductor's sleeve and they got out\nagain; then they stood in the blazing sun, near the door of a crowded\nbeer-saloon, waiting for another car to come; and that carried them out\nto a thinly settled district, past vacant lots and narrow brick houses\nstanding in unsupported solitude, till they finally reached an almost\nrural region of scattered cottages and low wooden buildings that looked\nlike village “stores.” Here the car finally stopped of its own accord,\nand they walked along a rutty road, past a stone-cutter's yard with a\nhigh fence tapestried with theatrical advertisements, to a little red\nhouse with green blinds and a garden paling. Really, Mr. Ramy had not\ndeceived them. Clumps of dielytra and day-lilies bloomed behind the\npaling, and a crooked elm hung romantically over the gable of the house.\n\nAt the gate Mrs. Hochmuller, a broad woman in brick-brown merino, met\nthem with nods and smiles, while her daughter Linda, a flaxen-haired\ngirl with mottled red cheeks and a sidelong stare, hovered inquisitively\nbehind her. Mrs. Hochmuller, leading the way into the house, conducted\nthe Bunner sisters the way to her bedroom. Here they were invited to\nspread out on a mountainous white featherbed the cashmere mantles under\nwhich the solemnity of the occasion had compelled them to swelter,\nand when they had given their black silks the necessary twitch\nof readjustment, and Evelina had fluffed out her hair before a\nlooking-glass framed in pink-shell work, their hostess led them to a\nstuffy parlour smelling of gingerbread. After another ceremonial pause,\nbroken by polite enquiries and shy ejaculations, they were shown into\nthe kitchen, where the table was already spread with strange-looking\nspice-cakes and stewed fruits, and where they presently found themselves\nseated between Mrs. Hochmuller and Mr. Ramy, while the staring Linda\nbumped back and forth from the stove with steaming dishes.\n\nTo Ann Eliza the dinner seemed endless, and the rich fare strangely\nunappetizing. She was abashed by the easy intimacy of her hostess's\nvoice and eye. With Mr. Ramy Mrs. Hochmuller was almost flippantly\nfamiliar, and it was only when Ann Eliza pictured her generous form bent\nabove his sick-bed that she could forgive her for tersely addressing him\nas “Ramy.” During one of the pauses of the meal Mrs. Hochmuller laid her\nknife and fork against the edges of her plate, and, fixing her eyes\non the clock-maker's face, said accusingly: “You hat one of dem turns\nagain, Ramy.”\n\n“I dunno as I had,” he returned evasively.\n\nEvelina glanced from one to the other. “Mr. Ramy HAS been sick,” she\nsaid at length, as though to show that she also was in a position to\nspeak with authority. “He's complained very frequently of headaches.”\n\n“Ho!--I know him,” said Mrs. Hochmuller with a laugh, her eyes still on\nthe clock-maker. “Ain't you ashamed of yourself, Ramy?”\n\nMr. Ramy, who was looking at his plate, said suddenly one word which the\nsisters could not understand; it sounded to Ann Eliza like “Shwike.”\n\nMrs. Hochmuller laughed again. “My, my,” she said, “wouldn't you think\nhe'd be ashamed to go and be sick and never dell me, me that nursed him\ntroo dat awful fever?”\n\n“Yes, I SHOULD,” said Evelina, with a spirited glance at Ramy; but he\nwas looking at the sausages that Linda had just put on the table.\n\nWhen dinner was over Mrs. Hochmuller invited her guests to step out of\nthe kitchen-door, and they found themselves in a green enclosure, half\ngarden, half orchard. Grey hens followed by golden broods clucked under\nthe twisted apple-boughs, a cat dozed on the edge of an old well, and\nfrom tree to tree ran the network of clothes-line that denoted Mrs.\nHochmuller's calling. Beyond the apple trees stood a yellow summer-house\nfestooned with scarlet runners; and below it, on the farther side of\na rough fence, the land dipped down, holding a bit of woodland in\nits hollow. It was all strangely sweet and still on that hot Sunday\nafternoon, and as she moved across the grass under the apple-boughs Ann\nEliza thought of quiet afternoons in church, and of the hymns her mother\nhad sung to her when she was a baby.\n\nEvelina was more restless. She wandered from the well to the\nsummer-house and back, she tossed crumbs to the chickens and disturbed\nthe cat with arch caresses; and at last she expressed a desire to go\ndown into the wood.\n\n“I guess you got to go round by the road, then,” said Mrs. Hochmuller.\n“My Linda she goes troo a hole in de fence, but I guess you'd tear your\ndress if you was to dry.”\n\n“I'll help you,” said Mr. Ramy; and guided by Linda the pair walked\nalong the fence till they reached a narrow gap in its boards. Through\nthis they disappeared, watched curiously in their descent by the\ngrinning Linda, while Mrs. Hochmuller and Ann Eliza were left alone in\nthe summer-house.\n\nMrs. Hochmuller looked at her guest with a confidential smile. “I guess\ndey'll be gone quite a while,” she remarked, jerking her double chin\ntoward the gap in the fence. “Folks like dat don't never remember about\nde dime.” And she drew out her knitting.\n\nAnn Eliza could think of nothing to say.\n\n“Your sister she thinks a great lot of him, don't she?” her hostess\ncontinued.\n\nAnn Eliza's cheeks grew hot. “Ain't you a teeny bit lonesome away out\nhere sometimes?” she asked. “I should think you'd be scared nights, all\nalone with your daughter.”\n\n“Oh, no, I ain't,” said Mrs. Hochmuller. “You see I take in\nwashing--dat's my business--and it's a lot cheaper doing it out here dan\nin de city: where'd I get a drying-ground like dis in Hobucken? And den\nit's safer for Linda too; it geeps her outer de streets.”\n\n“Oh,” said Ann Eliza, shrinking. She began to feel a distinct aversion\nfor her hostess, and her eyes turned with involuntary annoyance to the\nsquare-backed form of Linda, still inquisitively suspended on the fence.\nIt seemed to Ann Eliza that Evelina and her companion would never return\nfrom the wood; but they came at length, Mr. Ramy's brow pearled with\nperspiration, Evelina pink and conscious, a drooping bunch of ferns in\nher hand; and it was clear that, to her at least, the moments had been\nwinged.\n\n“D'you suppose they'll revive?” she asked, holding up the ferns; but\nAnn Eliza, rising at her approach, said stiffly: “We'd better be getting\nhome, Evelina.”\n\n“Mercy me! Ain't you going to take your coffee first?” Mrs. Hochmuller\nprotested; and Ann Eliza found to her dismay that another long\ngastronomic ceremony must intervene before politeness permitted them\nto leave. At length, however, they found themselves again on the\nferry-boat. Water and sky were grey, with a dividing gleam of sunset\nthat sent sleek opal waves in the boat's wake. The wind had a cool tarry\nbreath, as though it had travelled over miles of shipping, and the hiss\nof the water about the paddles was as delicious as though it had been\nsplashed into their tired faces.\n\nAnn Eliza sat apart, looking away from the others. She had made up her\nmind that Mr. Ramy had proposed to Evelina in the wood, and she was\nsilently preparing herself to receive her sister's confidence that\nevening.\n\nBut Evelina was apparently in no mood for confidences. When they reached\nhome she put her faded ferns in water, and after supper, when she had\nlaid aside her silk dress and the forget-me-not bonnet, she remained\nsilently seated in her rocking-chair near the open window. It was long\nsince Ann Eliza had seen her in so uncommunicative a mood.\n\n\nThe following Saturday Ann Eliza was sitting alone in the shop when the\ndoor opened and Mr. Ramy entered. He had never before called at that\nhour, and she wondered a little anxiously what had brought him.\n\n“Has anything happened?” she asked, pushing aside the basketful of\nbuttons she had been sorting.\n\n“Not's I know of,” said Mr. Ramy tranquilly. “But I always close up the\nstore at two o'clock Saturdays at this season, so I thought I might as\nwell call round and see you.”\n\n“I'm real glad, I'm sure,” said Ann Eliza; “but Evelina's out.”\n\n“I know dat,” Mr. Ramy answered. “I met her round de corner. She told me\nshe got to go to dat new dyer's up in Forty-eighth Street. She won't be\nback for a couple of hours, har'ly, will she?”\n\nAnn Eliza looked at him with rising bewilderment. “No, I guess not,” she\nanswered; her instinctive hospitality prompting her to add: “Won't you\nset down jest the same?”\n\nMr. Ramy sat down on the stool beside the counter, and Ann Eliza\nreturned to her place behind it.\n\n“I can't leave the store,” she explained.\n\n“Well, I guess we're very well here.” Ann Eliza had become suddenly\naware that Mr. Ramy was looking at her with unusual intentness.\nInvoluntarily her hand strayed to the thin streaks of hair on her\ntemples, and thence descended to straighten the brooch beneath her\ncollar.\n\n“You're looking very well to-day, Miss Bunner,” said Mr. Ramy, following\nher gesture with a smile.\n\n“Oh,” said Ann Eliza nervously. “I'm always well in health,” she added.\n\n“I guess you're healthier than your sister, even if you are less\nsizeable.”\n\n“Oh, I don't know. Evelina's a mite nervous sometimes, but she ain't a\nbit sickly.”\n\n“She eats heartier than you do; but that don't mean nothing,” said Mr.\nRamy.\n\nAnn Eliza was silent. She could not follow the trend of his thought, and\nshe did not care to commit herself farther about Evelina before she\nhad ascertained if Mr. Ramy considered nervousness interesting or the\nreverse.\n\nBut Mr. Ramy spared her all farther indecision.\n\n“Well, Miss Bunner,” he said, drawing his stool closer to the counter,\n“I guess I might as well tell you fust as last what I come here for\nto-day. I want to get married.”\n\nAnn Eliza, in many a prayerful midnight hour, had sought to strengthen\nherself for the hearing of this avowal, but now that it had come she\nfelt pitifully frightened and unprepared. Mr. Ramy was leaning with both\nelbows on the counter, and she noticed that his nails were clean and\nthat he had brushed his hat; yet even these signs had not prepared her!\n\nAt last she heard herself say, with a dry throat in which her heart was\nhammering: “Mercy me, Mr. Ramy!”\n\n“I want to get married,” he repeated. “I'm too lonesome. It ain't good\nfor a man to live all alone, and eat noding but cold meat every day.”\n\n“No,” said Ann Eliza softly.\n\n“And the dust fairly beats me.”\n\n“Oh, the dust--I know!”\n\nMr. Ramy stretched one of his blunt-fingered hands toward her. “I wisht\nyou'd take me.”\n\nStill Ann Eliza did not understand. She rose hesitatingly from her seat,\npushing aside the basket of buttons which lay between them; then she\nperceived that Mr. Ramy was trying to take her hand, and as their\nfingers met a flood of joy swept over her. Never afterward, though\nevery other word of their interview was stamped on her memory beyond\nall possible forgetting, could she recall what he said while their hands\ntouched; she only knew that she seemed to be floating on a summer sea,\nand that all its waves were in her ears.\n\n“Me--me?” she gasped.\n\n“I guess so,” said her suitor placidly. “You suit me right down to the\nground, Miss Bunner. Dat's the truth.”\n\nA woman passing along the street paused to look at the shop-window, and\nAnn Eliza half hoped she would come in; but after a desultory inspection\nshe went on.\n\n“Maybe you don't fancy me?” Mr. Ramy suggested, discountenanced by Ann\nEliza's silence.\n\nA word of assent was on her tongue, but her lips refused it. She must\nfind some other way of telling him.\n\n“I don't say that.”\n\n“Well, I always kinder thought we was suited to one another,” Mr.\nRamy continued, eased of his momentary doubt. “I always liked de quiet\nstyle--no fuss and airs, and not afraid of work.” He spoke as though\ndispassionately cataloguing her charms.\n\nAnn Eliza felt that she must make an end. “But, Mr. Ramy, you don't\nunderstand. I've never thought of marrying.”\n\nMr. Ramy looked at her in surprise. “Why not?”\n\n“Well, I don't know, har'ly.” She moistened her twitching lips. “The\nfact is, I ain't as active as I look. Maybe I couldn't stand the care.\nI ain't as spry as Evelina--nor as young,” she added, with a last great\neffort.\n\n“But you do most of de work here, anyways,” said her suitor doubtfully.\n\n“Oh, well, that's because Evelina's busy outside; and where there's only\ntwo women the work don't amount to much. Besides, I'm the oldest; I have\nto look after things,” she hastened on, half pained that her simple ruse\nshould so readily deceive him.\n\n“Well, I guess you're active enough for me,” he persisted. His calm\ndetermination began to frighten her; she trembled lest her own should be\nless staunch.\n\n“No, no,” she repeated, feeling the tears on her lashes. “I couldn't,\nMr. Ramy, I couldn't marry. I'm so surprised. I always thought it\nwas Evelina--always. And so did everybody else. She's so bright and\npretty--it seemed so natural.”\n\n“Well, you was all mistaken,” said Mr. Ramy obstinately.\n\n“I'm so sorry.”\n\nHe rose, pushing back his chair.\n\n“You'd better think it over,” he said, in the large tone of a man who\nfeels he may safely wait.\n\n“Oh, no, no. It ain't any sorter use, Mr. Ramy. I don't never mean to\nmarry. I get tired so easily--I'd be afraid of the work. And I have\nsuch awful headaches.” She paused, racking her brain for more convincing\ninfirmities.\n\n“Headaches, do you?” said Mr. Ramy, turning back.\n\n“My, yes, awful ones, that I have to give right up to. Evelina has to do\neverything when I have one of them headaches. She has to bring me my tea\nin the mornings.”\n\n“Well, I'm sorry to hear it,” said Mr. Ramy.\n\n“Thank you kindly all the same,” Ann Eliza murmured. “And please\ndon't--don't--” She stopped suddenly, looking at him through her tears.\n\n“Oh, that's all right,” he answered. “Don't you fret, Miss Gunner.\nFolks have got to suit themselves.” She thought his tone had grown more\nresigned since she had spoken of her headaches.\n\nFor some moments he stood looking at her with a hesitating eye, as\nthough uncertain how to end their conversation; and at length she found\ncourage to say (in the words of a novel she had once read): “I don't\nwant this should make any difference between us.”\n\n“Oh, my, no,” said Mr. Ramy, absently picking up his hat.\n\n“You'll come in just the same?” she continued, nerving herself to\nthe effort. “We'd miss you awfully if you didn't. Evelina, she--” She\npaused, torn between her desire to turn his thoughts to Evelina, and the\ndread of prematurely disclosing her sister's secret.\n\n“Don't Miss Evelina have no headaches?” Mr. Ramy suddenly asked.\n\n“My, no, never--well, not to speak of, anyway. She ain't had one for\nages, and when Evelina IS sick she won't never give in to it,” Ann Eliza\ndeclared, making some hurried adjustments with her conscience.\n\n“I wouldn't have thought that,” said Mr. Ramy.\n\n“I guess you don't know us as well as you thought you did.”\n\n“Well, no, that's so; maybe I don't. I'll wish you good day, Miss\nBunner”; and Mr. Ramy moved toward the door.\n\n“Good day, Mr. Ramy,” Ann Eliza answered.\n\nShe felt unutterably thankful to be alone. She knew the crucial moment\nof her life had passed, and she was glad that she had not fallen below\nher own ideals. It had been a wonderful experience; and in spite of\nthe tears on her cheeks she was not sorry to have known it. Two facts,\nhowever, took the edge from its perfection: that it had happened in the\nshop, and that she had not had on her black silk.\n\nShe passed the next hour in a state of dreamy ecstasy. Something had\nentered into her life of which no subsequent empoverishment could rob\nit: she glowed with the same rich sense of possessorship that once, as\na little girl, she had felt when her mother had given her a gold locket\nand she had sat up in bed in the dark to draw it from its hiding-place\nbeneath her night-gown.\n\nAt length a dread of Evelina's return began to mingle with these\nmusings. How could she meet her younger sister's eye without betraying\nwhat had happened? She felt as though a visible glory lay on her, and\nshe was glad that dusk had fallen when Evelina entered. But her fears\nwere superfluous. Evelina, always self-absorbed, had of late lost all\ninterest in the simple happenings of the shop, and Ann Eliza, with\nmingled mortification and relief, perceived that she was in no danger of\nbeing cross-questioned as to the events of the afternoon. She was\nglad of this; yet there was a touch of humiliation in finding that the\nportentous secret in her bosom did not visibly shine forth. It struck\nher as dull, and even slightly absurd, of Evelina not to know at last\nthat they were equals.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nMr. Ramy, after a decent interval, returned to the shop; and Ann Eliza,\nwhen they met, was unable to detect whether the emotions which seethed\nunder her black alpaca found an echo in his bosom. Outwardly he made no\nsign. He lit his pipe as placidly as ever and seemed to relapse without\neffort into the unruffled intimacy of old. Yet to Ann Eliza's initiated\neye a change became gradually perceptible. She saw that he was beginning\nto look at her sister as he had looked at her on that momentous\nafternoon: she even discerned a secret significance in the turn of his\ntalk with Evelina. Once he asked her abruptly if she should like\nto travel, and Ann Eliza saw that the flush on Evelina's cheek was\nreflected from the same fire which had scorched her own.\n\nSo they drifted on through the sultry weeks of July. At that season the\nbusiness of the little shop almost ceased, and one Saturday morning Mr.\nRamy proposed that the sisters should lock up early and go with him for\na sail down the bay in one of the Coney Island boats.\n\nAnn Eliza saw the light in Evelina's eye and her resolve was instantly\ntaken.\n\n“I guess I won't go, thank you kindly; but I'm sure my sister will be\nhappy to.”\n\nShe was pained by the perfunctory phrase with which Evelina urged her to\naccompany them; and still more by Mr. Ramy's silence.\n\n“No, I guess I won't go,” she repeated, rather in answer to herself than\nto them. “It's dreadfully hot and I've got a kinder headache.”\n\n“Oh, well, I wouldn't then,” said her sister hurriedly. “You'd better\njest set here quietly and rest.”\n\n“Yes, I'll rest,” Ann Eliza assented.\n\nAt two o'clock Mr. Ramy returned, and a moment later he and Evelina left\nthe shop. Evelina had made herself another new bonnet for the occasion,\na bonnet, Ann Eliza thought, almost too youthful in shape and colour.\nIt was the first time it had ever occurred to her to criticize Evelina's\ntaste, and she was frightened at the insidious change in her attitude\ntoward her sister.\n\nWhen Ann Eliza, in later days, looked back on that afternoon she felt\nthat there had been something prophetic in the quality of its solitude;\nit seemed to distill the triple essence of loneliness in which all her\nafter-life was to be lived. No purchasers came; not a hand fell on\nthe door-latch; and the tick of the clock in the back room ironically\nemphasized the passing of the empty hours.\n\nEvelina returned late and alone. Ann Eliza felt the coming crisis in the\nsound of her footstep, which wavered along as if not knowing on what it\ntrod. The elder sister's affection had so passionately projected itself\ninto her junior's fate that at such moments she seemed to be living\ntwo lives, her own and Evelina's; and her private longings shrank into\nsilence at the sight of the other's hungry bliss. But it was evident\nthat Evelina, never acutely alive to the emotional atmosphere about her,\nhad no idea that her secret was suspected; and with an assumption of\nunconcern that would have made Ann Eliza smile if the pang had been less\npiercing, the younger sister prepared to confess herself.\n\n“What are you so busy about?” she said impatiently, as Ann Eliza,\nbeneath the gas-jet, fumbled for the matches. “Ain't you even got time\nto ask me if I'd had a pleasant day?”\n\nAnn Eliza turned with a quiet smile. “I guess I don't have to. Seems to\nme it's pretty plain you have.”\n\n“Well, I don't know. I don't know HOW I feel--it's all so queer. I\nalmost think I'd like to scream.”\n\n“I guess you're tired.”\n\n“No, I ain't. It's not that. But it all happened so suddenly, and the\nboat was so crowded I thought everybody'd hear what he was saying.--Ann\nEliza,” she broke out, “why on earth don't you ask me what I'm talking\nabout?”\n\nAnn Eliza, with a last effort of heroism, feigned a fond\nincomprehension.\n\n“What ARE you?”\n\n“Why, I'm engaged to be married--so there! Now it's out! And it happened\nright on the boat; only to think of it! Of course I wasn't exactly\nsurprised--I've known right along he was going to sooner or later--on'y\nsomehow I didn't think of its happening to-day. I thought he'd never get\nup his courage. He said he was so 'fraid I'd say no--that's what kep'\nhim so long from asking me. Well, I ain't said yes YET--leastways I told\nhim I'd have to think it over; but I guess he knows. Oh, Ann Eliza, I'm\nso happy!” She hid the blinding brightness of her face.\n\nAnn Eliza, just then, would only let herself feel that she was glad. She\ndrew down Evelina's hands and kissed her, and they held each other. When\nEvelina regained her voice she had a tale to tell which carried their\nvigil far into the night. Not a syllable, not a glance or gesture of\nRamy's, was the elder sister spared; and with unconscious irony she\nfound herself comparing the details of his proposal to her with those\nwhich Evelina was imparting with merciless prolixity.\n\nThe next few days were taken up with the embarrassed adjustment of their\nnew relation to Mr. Ramy and to each other. Ann Eliza's ardour carried\nher to new heights of self-effacement, and she invented late duties in\nthe shop in order to leave Evelina and her suitor longer alone in the\nback room. Later on, when she tried to remember the details of those\nfirst days, few came back to her: she knew only that she got up each\nmorning with the sense of having to push the leaden hours up the same\nlong steep of pain.\n\nMr. Ramy came daily now. Every evening he and his betrothed went out\nfor a stroll around the Square, and when Evelina came in her cheeks were\nalways pink. “He's kissed her under that tree at the corner, away from\nthe lamp-post,” Ann Eliza said to herself, with sudden insight into\nunconjectured things. On Sundays they usually went for the whole\nafternoon to the Central Park, and Ann Eliza, from her seat in the\nmortal hush of the back room, followed step by step their long slow\nbeatific walk.\n\nThere had been, as yet, no allusion to their marriage, except that\nEvelina had once told her sister that Mr. Ramy wished them to invite\nMrs. Hochmuller and Linda to the wedding. The mention of the laundress\nraised a half-forgotten fear in Ann Eliza, and she said in a tone of\ntentative appeal: “I guess if I was you I wouldn't want to be very great\nfriends with Mrs. Hochmuller.”\n\nEvelina glanced at her compassionately. “I guess if you was me you'd\nwant to do everything you could to please the man you loved. It's\nlucky,” she added with glacial irony, “that I'm not too grand for\nHerman's friends.”\n\n“Oh,” Ann Eliza protested, “that ain't what I mean--and you know it\nain't. Only somehow the day we saw her I didn't think she seemed like\nthe kinder person you'd want for a friend.”\n\n“I guess a married woman's the best judge of such matters,” Evelina\nreplied, as though she already walked in the light of her future state.\n\nAnn Eliza, after that, kept her own counsel. She saw that Evelina wanted\nher sympathy as little as her admonitions, and that already she counted\nfor nothing in her sister's scheme of life. To Ann Eliza's idolatrous\nacceptance of the cruelties of fate this exclusion seemed both natural\nand just; but it caused her the most lively pain. She could not divest\nher love for Evelina of its passionate motherliness; no breath of reason\ncould lower it to the cool temperature of sisterly affection.\n\nShe was then passing, as she thought, through the novitiate of her pain;\npreparing, in a hundred experimental ways, for the solitude awaiting her\nwhen Evelina left. It was true that it would be a tempered loneliness.\nThey would not be far apart. Evelina would “run in” daily from the\nclock-maker's; they would doubtless take supper with her on Sundays. But\nalready Ann Eliza guessed with what growing perfunctoriness her sister\nwould fulfill these obligations; she even foresaw the day when, to get\nnews of Evelina, she should have to lock the shop at nightfall and go\nherself to Mr. Ramy's door. But on that contingency she would not dwell.\n“They can come to me when they want to--they'll always find me here,”\n she simply said to herself.\n\nOne evening Evelina came in flushed and agitated from her stroll around\nthe Square. Ann Eliza saw at once that something had happened; but the\nnew habit of reticence checked her question.\n\nShe had not long to wait. “Oh, Ann Eliza, on'y to think what he says--”\n (the pronoun stood exclusively for Mr. Ramy). “I declare I'm so upset I\nthought the people in the Square would notice me. Don't I look queer? He\nwants to get married right off--this very next week.”\n\n“Next week?”\n\n“Yes. So's we can move out to St. Louis right away.”\n\n“Him and you--move out to St. Louis?”\n\n“Well, I don't know as it would be natural for him to want to go out\nthere without me,” Evelina simpered. “But it's all so sudden I don't\nknow what to think. He only got the letter this morning. <i>Do</i> I look\nqueer, Ann Eliza?” Her eye was roving for the mirror.\n\n“No, you don't,” said Ann Eliza almost harshly.\n\n“Well, it's a mercy,” Evelina pursued with a tinge of disappointment.\n“It's a regular miracle I didn't faint right out there in the Square.\nHerman's so thoughtless--he just put the letter into my hand without a\nword. It's from a big firm out there--the Tiff'ny of St. Louis, he says\nit is--offering him a place in their clock-department. Seems they heard\nof him through a German friend of his that's settled out there. It's a\nsplendid opening, and if he gives satisfaction they'll raise him at the\nend of the year.”\n\nShe paused, flushed with the importance of the situation, which seemed\nto lift her once for all above the dull level of her former life.\n\n“Then you'll have to go?” came at last from Ann Eliza.\n\nEvelina stared. “You wouldn't have me interfere with his prospects,\nwould you?”\n\n“No--no. I on'y meant--has it got to be so soon?”\n\n“Right away, I tell you--next week. Ain't it awful?” blushed the bride.\n\nWell, this was what happened to mothers. They bore it, Ann Eliza mused;\nso why not she? Ah, but they had their own chance first; she had had no\nchance at all. And now this life which she had made her own was going\nfrom her forever; had gone, already, in the inner and deeper sense, and\nwas soon to vanish in even its outward nearness, its surface-communion\nof voice and eye. At that moment even the thought of Evelina's happiness\nrefused her its consolatory ray; or its light, if she saw it, was too\nremote to warm her. The thirst for a personal and inalienable tie, for\npangs and problems of her own, was parching Ann Eliza's soul: it seemed\nto her that she could never again gather strength to look her loneliness\nin the face.\n\nThe trivial obligations of the moment came to her aid. Nursed in\nidleness her grief would have mastered her; but the needs of the shop\nand the back room, and the preparations for Evelina's marriage, kept the\ntyrant under.\n\nMiss Mellins, true to her anticipations, had been called on to aid in\nthe making of the wedding dress, and she and Ann Eliza were bending one\nevening over the breadths of pearl-grey cashmere which in spite of the\ndress-maker's prophetic vision of gored satin, had been judged most\nsuitable, when Evelina came into the room alone.\n\nAnn Eliza had already had occasion to notice that it was a bad sign when\nMr. Ramy left his affianced at the door. It generally meant that Evelina\nhad something disturbing to communicate, and Ann Eliza's first glance\ntold her that this time the news was grave.\n\nMiss Mellins, who sat with her back to the door and her head bent over\nher sewing, started as Evelina came around to the opposite side of the\ntable.\n\n“Mercy, Miss Evelina! I declare I thought you was a ghost, the way you\ncrep' in. I had a customer once up in Forty-ninth Street--a lovely young\nwoman with a thirty-six bust and a waist you could ha' put into her\nwedding ring--and her husband, he crep' up behind her that way jest for\na joke, and frightened her into a fit, and when she come to she was a\nraving maniac, and had to be taken to Bloomingdale with two doctors and\na nurse to hold her in the carriage, and a lovely baby on'y six weeks\nold--and there she is to this day, poor creature.”\n\n“I didn't mean to startle you,” said Evelina.\n\nShe sat down on the nearest chair, and as the lamp-light fell on her\nface Ann Eliza saw that she had been crying.\n\n“You do look dead-beat,” Miss Mellins resumed, after a pause of\nsoul-probing scrutiny. “I guess Mr. Ramy lugs you round that Square too\noften. You'll walk your legs off if you ain't careful. Men don't never\nconsider--they're all alike. Why, I had a cousin once that was engaged\nto a book-agent--”\n\n“Maybe we'd better put away the work for to-night, Miss Mellins,” Ann\nEliza interposed. “I guess what Evelina wants is a good night's rest.”\n\n“That's so,” assented the dress-maker. “Have you got the back breadths\nrun together, Miss Bunner? Here's the sleeves. I'll pin 'em together.”\n She drew a cluster of pins from her mouth, in which she seemed to\nsecrete them as squirrels stow away nuts. “There,” she said, rolling up\nher work, “you go right away to bed, Miss Evelina, and we'll set up a\nlittle later to-morrow night. I guess you're a mite nervous, ain't you?\nI know when my turn comes I'll be scared to death.”\n\nWith this arch forecast she withdrew, and Ann Eliza, returning to the\nback room, found Evelina still listlessly seated by the table. True to\nher new policy of silence, the elder sister set about folding up the\nbridal dress; but suddenly Evelina said in a harsh unnatural voice:\n“There ain't any use in going on with that.”\n\nThe folds slipped from Ann Eliza's hands.\n\n“Evelina Bunner--what you mean?”\n\n“Jest what I say. It's put off.”\n\n“Put off--what's put off?”\n\n“Our getting married. He can't take me to St. Louis. He ain't got money\nenough.” She brought the words out in the monotonous tone of a child\nreciting a lesson.\n\nAnn Eliza picked up another breadth of cashmere and began to smooth it\nout. “I don't understand,” she said at length.\n\n“Well, it's plain enough. The journey's fearfully expensive, and we've\ngot to have something left to start with when we get out there. We've\ncounted up, and he ain't got the money to do it--that's all.”\n\n“But I thought he was going right into a splendid place.”\n\n“So he is; but the salary's pretty low the first year, and board's very\nhigh in St. Louis. He's jest got another letter from his German friend,\nand he's been figuring it out, and he's afraid to chance it. He'll have\nto go alone.”\n\n“But there's your money--have you forgotten that? The hundred dollars in\nthe bank.”\n\nEvelina made an impatient movement. “Of course I ain't forgotten it.\nOn'y it ain't enough. It would all have to go into buying furniture,\nand if he was took sick and lost his place again we wouldn't have a cent\nleft. He says he's got to lay by another hundred dollars before he'll be\nwilling to take me out there.”\n\nFor a while Ann Eliza pondered this surprising statement; then she\nventured: “Seems to me he might have thought of it before.”\n\nIn an instant Evelina was aflame. “I guess he knows what's right as well\nas you or me. I'd sooner die than be a burden to him.”\n\nAnn Eliza made no answer. The clutch of an unformulated doubt had\nchecked the words on her lips. She had meant, on the day of her sister's\nmarriage, to give Evelina the other half of their common savings; but\nsomething warned her not to say so now.\n\nThe sisters undressed without farther words. After they had gone to bed,\nand the light had been put out, the sound of Evelina's weeping came to\nAnn Eliza in the darkness, but she lay motionless on her own side of the\nbed, out of contact with her sister's shaken body. Never had she felt so\ncoldly remote from Evelina.\n\nThe hours of the night moved slowly, ticked off with wearisome\ninsistence by the clock which had played so prominent a part in their\nlives. Evelina's sobs still stirred the bed at gradually lengthening\nintervals, till at length Ann Eliza thought she slept. But with the dawn\nthe eyes of the sisters met, and Ann Eliza's courage failed her as she\nlooked in Evelina's face.\n\nShe sat up in bed and put out a pleading hand.\n\n“Don't cry so, dearie. Don't.”\n\n“Oh, I can't bear it, I can't bear it,” Evelina moaned.\n\nAnn Eliza stroked her quivering shoulder. “Don't, don't,” she repeated.\n“If you take the other hundred, won't that be enough? I always meant to\ngive it to you. On'y I didn't want to tell you till your wedding day.”\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nEvelina's marriage took place on the appointed day. It was celebrated\nin the evening, in the chantry of the church which the sisters attended,\nand after it was over the few guests who had been present repaired to\nthe Bunner Sisters' basement, where a wedding supper awaited them. Ann\nEliza, aided by Miss Mellins and Mrs. Hawkins, and consciously supported\nby the sentimental interest of the whole street, had expended her utmost\nenergy on the decoration of the shop and the back room. On the table a\nvase of white chrysanthemums stood between a dish of oranges and bananas\nand an iced wedding-cake wreathed with orange-blossoms of the bride's\nown making. Autumn leaves studded with paper roses festooned the\nwhat-not and the chromo of the Rock of Ages, and a wreath of yellow\nimmortelles was twined about the clock which Evelina revered as the\nmysterious agent of her happiness.\n\nAt the table sat Miss Mellins, profusely spangled and bangled, her head\nsewing-girl, a pale young thing who had helped with Evelina's outfit,\nMr. and Mrs. Hawkins, with Johnny, their eldest boy, and Mrs. Hochmuller\nand her daughter.\n\nMrs. Hochmuller's large blonde personality seemed to pervade the room\nto the effacement of the less amply-proportioned guests. It was rendered\nmore impressive by a dress of crimson poplin that stood out from her in\norgan-like folds; and Linda, whom Ann Eliza had remembered as an\nuncouth child with a sly look about the eyes, surprised her by a sudden\nblossoming into feminine grace such as sometimes follows on a gawky\ngirlhood. The Hochmullers, in fact, struck the dominant note in the\nentertainment. Beside them Evelina, unusually pale in her grey cashmere\nand white bonnet, looked like a faintly washed sketch beside a brilliant\nchromo; and Mr. Ramy, doomed to the traditional insignificance of the\nbridegroom's part, made no attempt to rise above his situation.\nEven Miss Mellins sparkled and jingled in vain in the shadow of\nMrs. Hochmuller's crimson bulk; and Ann Eliza, with a sense of vague\nforeboding, saw that the wedding feast centred about the two guests she\nhad most wished to exclude from it. What was said or done while they\nall sat about the table she never afterward recalled: the long hours\nremained in her memory as a whirl of high colours and loud voices, from\nwhich the pale presence of Evelina now and then emerged like a drowned\nface on a sunset-dabbled sea.\n\nThe next morning Mr. Ramy and his wife started for St. Louis, and Ann\nEliza was left alone. Outwardly the first strain of parting was tempered\nby the arrival of Miss Mellins, Mrs. Hawkins and Johnny, who dropped in\nto help in the ungarlanding and tidying up of the back room. Ann Eliza\nwas duly grateful for their kindness, but the “talking over” on which\nthey had evidently counted was Dead Sea fruit on her lips; and just\nbeyond the familiar warmth of their presences she saw the form of\nSolitude at her door.\n\nAnn Eliza was but a small person to harbour so great a guest, and a\ntrembling sense of insufficiency possessed her. She had no high musings\nto offer to the new companion of her hearth. Every one of her thoughts\nhad hitherto turned to Evelina and shaped itself in homely easy words;\nof the mighty speech of silence she knew not the earliest syllable.\n\nEverything in the back room and the shop, on the second day after\nEvelina's going, seemed to have grown coldly unfamiliar. The whole\naspect of the place had changed with the changed conditions of Ann\nEliza's life. The first customer who opened the shop-door startled her\nlike a ghost; and all night she lay tossing on her side of the bed,\nsinking now and then into an uncertain doze from which she would\nsuddenly wake to reach out her hand for Evelina. In the new silence\nsurrounding her the walls and furniture found voice, frightening her\nat dusk and midnight with strange sighs and stealthy whispers. Ghostly\nhands shook the window shutters or rattled at the outer latch, and once\nshe grew cold at the sound of a step like Evelina's stealing through the\ndark shop to die out on the threshold. In time, of course, she found\nan explanation for these noises, telling herself that the bedstead was\nwarping, that Miss Mellins trod heavily overhead, or that the thunder of\npassing beer-waggons shook the door-latch; but the hours leading up to\nthese conclusions were full of the floating terrors that harden into\nfixed foreboding. Worst of all were the solitary meals, when she\nabsently continued to set aside the largest slice of pie for Evelina,\nand to let the tea grow cold while she waited for her sister to help\nherself to the first cup. Miss Mellins, coming in on one of these sad\nrepasts, suggested the acquisition of a cat; but Ann Eliza shook\nher head. She had never been used to animals, and she felt the vague\nshrinking of the pious from creatures divided from her by the abyss of\nsoullessness.\n\nAt length, after ten empty days, Evelina's first letter came.\n\n“My dear Sister,” she wrote, in her pinched Spencerian hand, “it seems\nstrange to be in this great City so far from home alone with him I have\nchosen for life, but marriage has its solemn duties which those who are\nnot can never hope to understand, and happier perhaps for this reason,\nlife for them has only simple tasks and pleasures, but those who must\ntake thought for others must be prepared to do their duty in whatever\nstation it has pleased the Almighty to call them. Not that I have cause\nto complain, my dear Husband is all love and devotion, but being absent\nall day at his business how can I help but feel lonesome at times, as\nthe poet says it is hard for they that love to live apart, and I often\nwonder, my dear Sister, how you are getting along alone in the store,\nmay you never experience the feelings of solitude I have underwent since\nI came here. We are boarding now, but soon expect to find rooms and\nchange our place of Residence, then I shall have all the care of a\nhousehold to bear, but such is the fate of those who join their Lot with\nothers, they cannot hope to escape from the burdens of Life, nor would\nI ask it, I would not live alway but while I live would always pray for\nstrength to do my duty. This city is not near as large or handsome as\nNew York, but had my lot been cast in a Wilderness I hope I should\nnot repine, such never was my nature, and they who exchange their\nindependence for the sweet name of Wife must be prepared to find all is\nnot gold that glitters, nor I would not expect like you to drift down\nthe stream of Life unfettered and serene as a Summer cloud, such is\nnot my fate, but come what may will always find in me a resigned and\nprayerful Spirit, and hoping this finds you as well as it leaves me, I\nremain, my dear Sister,\n\n“Yours truly,\n\n“EVELINA B. RAMY.”\n\n\nAnn Eliza had always secretly admired the oratorical and impersonal tone\nof Evelina's letters; but the few she had previously read, having been\naddressed to school-mates or distant relatives, had appeared in the\nlight of literary compositions rather than as records of personal\nexperience. Now she could not but wish that Evelina had laid aside her\nswelling periods for a style more suited to the chronicling of homely\nincidents. She read the letter again and again, seeking for a clue to\nwhat her sister was really doing and thinking; but after each reading\nshe emerged impressed but unenlightened from the labyrinth of Evelina's\neloquence.\n\nDuring the early winter she received two or three more letters of the\nsame kind, each enclosing in its loose husk of rhetoric a smaller kernel\nof fact. By dint of patient interlinear study, Ann Eliza gathered from\nthem that Evelina and her husband, after various costly experiments in\nboarding, had been reduced to a tenement-house flat; that living in St.\nLouis was more expensive than they had supposed, and that Mr. Ramy was\nkept out late at night (why, at a jeweller's, Ann Eliza wondered?) and\nfound his position less satisfactory than he had been led to expect.\nToward February the letters fell off; and finally they ceased to come.\n\nAt first Ann Eliza wrote, shyly but persistently, entreating for more\nfrequent news; then, as one appeal after another was swallowed up in the\nmystery of Evelina's protracted silence, vague fears began to assail the\nelder sister. Perhaps Evelina was ill, and with no one to nurse her but\na man who could not even make himself a cup of tea! Ann Eliza recalled\nthe layer of dust in Mr. Ramy's shop, and pictures of domestic disorder\nmingled with the more poignant vision of her sister's illness. But\nsurely if Evelina were ill Mr. Ramy would have written. He wrote a\nsmall neat hand, and epistolary communication was not an insuperable\nembarrassment to him. The too probable alternative was that both\nthe unhappy pair had been prostrated by some disease which left them\npowerless to summon her--for summon her they surely would, Ann Eliza\nwith unconscious cynicism reflected, if she or her small economies could\nbe of use to them! The more she strained her eyes into the mystery, the\ndarker it grew; and her lack of initiative, her inability to imagine\nwhat steps might be taken to trace the lost in distant places, left her\nbenumbed and helpless.\n\nAt last there floated up from some depth of troubled memory the name\nof the firm of St. Louis jewellers by whom Mr. Ramy was employed. After\nmuch hesitation, and considerable effort, she addressed to them a timid\nrequest for news of her brother-in-law; and sooner than she could have\nhoped the answer reached her.\n\n“DEAR MADAM,\n\n“In reply to yours of the 29th ult. we beg to state the party you refer\nto was discharged from our employ a month ago. We are sorry we are\nunable to furnish you wish his address.\n\n“Yours Respectfully,\n\n“LUDWIG AND HAMMERBUSCH.”\n\n\nAnn Eliza read and re-read the curt statement in a stupor of distress.\nShe had lost her last trace of Evelina. All that night she lay awake,\nrevolving the stupendous project of going to St. Louis in search of her\nsister; but though she pieced together her few financial possibilities\nwith the ingenuity of a brain used to fitting odd scraps into patch-work\nquilts, she woke to the cold daylight fact that she could not raise the\nmoney for her fare. Her wedding gift to Evelina had left her without any\nresources beyond her daily earnings, and these had steadily dwindled as\nthe winter passed. She had long since renounced her weekly visit to the\nbutcher, and had reduced her other expenses to the narrowest measure;\nbut the most systematic frugality had not enabled her to put by any\nmoney. In spite of her dogged efforts to maintain the prosperity of the\nlittle shop, her sister's absence had already told on its business.\nNow that Ann Eliza had to carry the bundles to the dyer's herself, the\ncustomers who called in her absence, finding the shop locked, too often\nwent elsewhere. Moreover, after several stern but unavailing efforts,\nshe had had to give up the trimming of bonnets, which in Evelina's hands\nhad been the most lucrative as well as the most interesting part of the\nbusiness. This change, to the passing female eye, robbed the shop window\nof its chief attraction; and when painful experience had convinced the\nregular customers of the Bunner Sisters of Ann Eliza's lack of millinery\nskill they began to lose faith in her ability to curl a feather or even\n“freshen up” a bunch of flowers. The time came when Ann Eliza had almost\nmade up her mind to speak to the lady with puffed sleeves, who had\nalways looked at her so kindly, and had once ordered a hat of Evelina.\nPerhaps the lady with puffed sleeves would be able to get her a little\nplain sewing to do; or she might recommend the shop to friends. Ann\nEliza, with this possibility in view, rummaged out of a drawer the\nfly-blown remainder of the business cards which the sisters had ordered\nin the first flush of their commercial adventure; but when the lady with\npuffed sleeves finally appeared she was in deep mourning, and wore\nso sad a look that Ann Eliza dared not speak. She came in to buy some\nspools of black thread and silk, and in the doorway she turned back to\nsay: “I am going away to-morrow for a long time. I hope you will have a\npleasant winter.” And the door shut on her.\n\nOne day not long after this it occurred to Ann Eliza to go to Hoboken in\nquest of Mrs. Hochmuller. Much as she shrank from pouring her distress\ninto that particular ear, her anxiety had carried her beyond such\nreluctance; but when she began to think the matter over she was faced by\na new difficulty. On the occasion of her only visit to Mrs. Hochmuller,\nshe and Evelina had suffered themselves to be led there by Mr. Ramy;\nand Ann Eliza now perceived that she did not even know the name of the\nlaundress's suburb, much less that of the street in which she lived.\nBut she must have news of Evelina, and no obstacle was great enough to\nthwart her.\n\nThough she longed to turn to some one for advice she disliked to expose\nher situation to Miss Mellins's searching eye, and at first she could\nthink of no other confidant. Then she remembered Mrs. Hawkins, or\nrather her husband, who, though Ann Eliza had always thought him a\ndull uneducated man, was probably gifted with the mysterious masculine\nfaculty of finding out people's addresses. It went hard with Ann Eliza\nto trust her secret even to the mild ear of Mrs. Hawkins, but at least\nshe was spared the cross-examination to which the dress-maker would\nhave subjected her. The accumulating pressure of domestic cares had so\ncrushed in Mrs. Hawkins any curiosity concerning the affairs of others\nthat she received her visitor's confidence with an almost masculine\nindifference, while she rocked her teething baby on one arm and with the\nother tried to check the acrobatic impulses of the next in age.\n\n“My, my,” she simply said as Ann Eliza ended. “Keep still now, Arthur:\nMiss Bunner don't want you to jump up and down on her foot to-day. And\nwhat are you gaping at, Johnny? Run right off and play,” she added,\nturning sternly to her eldest, who, because he was the least naughty,\nusually bore the brunt of her wrath against the others.\n\n“Well, perhaps Mr. Hawkins can help you,” Mrs. Hawkins continued\nmeditatively, while the children, after scattering at her bidding,\nreturned to their previous pursuits like flies settling down on the\nspot from which an exasperated hand has swept them. “I'll send him right\nround the minute he comes in, and you can tell him the whole story. I\nwouldn't wonder but what he can find that Mrs. Hochmuller's address in\nthe d'rectory. I know they've got one where he works.”\n\n“I'd be real thankful if he could,” Ann Eliza murmured, rising from her\nseat with the factitious sense of lightness that comes from imparting a\nlong-hidden dread.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nMr. Hawkins proved himself worthy of his wife's faith in his capacity.\nHe learned from Ann Eliza as much as she could tell him about Mrs.\nHochmuller and returned the next evening with a scrap of paper bearing\nher address, beneath which Johnny (the family scribe) had written in a\nlarge round hand the names of the streets that led there from the ferry.\n\nAnn Eliza lay awake all that night, repeating over and over again the\ndirections Mr. Hawkins had given her. He was a kind man, and she knew\nhe would willingly have gone with her to Hoboken; indeed she read in his\ntimid eye the half-formed intention of offering to accompany her--but on\nsuch an errand she preferred to go alone.\n\nThe next Sunday, accordingly, she set out early, and without much\ntrouble found her way to the ferry. Nearly a year had passed since her\nprevious visit to Mrs. Hochmuller, and a chilly April breeze smote her\nface as she stepped on the boat. Most of the passengers were huddled\ntogether in the cabin, and Ann Eliza shrank into its obscurest corner,\nshivering under the thin black mantle which had seemed so hot in July.\nShe began to feel a little bewildered as she stepped ashore, but a\npaternal policeman put her into the right car, and as in a dream she\nfound herself retracing the way to Mrs. Hochmuller's door. She had told\nthe conductor the name of the street at which she wished to get out,\nand presently she stood in the biting wind at the corner near the\nbeer-saloon, where the sun had once beat down on her so fiercely. At\nlength an empty car appeared, its yellow flank emblazoned with the name\nof Mrs. Hochmuller's suburb, and Ann Eliza was presently jolting past\nthe narrow brick houses islanded between vacant lots like giant piles in\na desolate lagoon. When the car reached the end of its journey she got\nout and stood for some time trying to remember which turn Mr. Ramy had\ntaken. She had just made up her mind to ask the car-driver when he shook\nthe reins on the backs of his lean horses, and the car, still empty,\njogged away toward Hoboken.\n\nAnn Eliza, left alone by the roadside, began to move cautiously\nforward, looking about for a small red house with a gable overhung by an\nelm-tree; but everything about her seemed unfamiliar and forbidding. One\nor two surly looking men slouched past with inquisitive glances, and she\ncould not make up her mind to stop and speak to them.\n\nAt length a tow-headed boy came out of a swinging door suggestive of\nillicit conviviality, and to him Ann Eliza ventured to confide\nher difficulty. The offer of five cents fired him with an instant\nwillingness to lead her to Mrs. Hochmuller, and he was soon trotting\npast the stone-cutter's yard with Ann Eliza in his wake.\n\nAnother turn in the road brought them to the little red house, and\nhaving rewarded her guide Ann Eliza unlatched the gate and walked up to\nthe door. Her heart was beating violently, and she had to lean against\nthe door-post to compose her twitching lips: she had not known till that\nmoment how much it was going to hurt her to speak of Evelina to Mrs.\nHochmuller. As her agitation subsided she began to notice how much the\nappearance of the house had changed. It was not only that winter had\nstripped the elm, and blackened the flower-borders: the house itself had\na debased and deserted air. The window-panes were cracked and dirty, and\none or two shutters swung dismally on loosened hinges.\n\nShe rang several times before the door was opened. At length an Irish\nwoman with a shawl over her head and a baby in her arms appeared on the\nthreshold, and glancing past her into the narrow passage Ann Eliza saw\nthat Mrs. Hochmuller's neat abode had deteriorated as much within as\nwithout.\n\nAt the mention of the name the woman stared. “Mrs. who, did ye say?”\n\n“Mrs. Hochmuller. This is surely her house?”\n\n“No, it ain't neither,” said the woman turning away.\n\n“Oh, but wait, please,” Ann Eliza entreated. “I can't be mistaken. I\nmean the Mrs. Hochmuller who takes in washing. I came out to see her\nlast June.”\n\n“Oh, the Dutch washerwoman is it--her that used to live here? She's been\ngone two months and more. It's Mike McNulty lives here now. Whisht!” to\nthe baby, who had squared his mouth for a howl.\n\nAnn Eliza's knees grew weak. “Mrs. Hochmuller gone? But where has she\ngone? She must be somewhere round here. Can't you tell me?”\n\n“Sure an' I can't,” said the woman. “She wint away before iver we come.”\n\n“Dalia Geoghegan, will ye bring the choild in out av the cowld?” cried\nan irate voice from within.\n\n“Please wait--oh, please wait,” Ann Eliza insisted. “You see I must find\nMrs. Hochmuller.”\n\n“Why don't ye go and look for her thin?” the woman returned, slamming\nthe door in her face.\n\nShe stood motionless on the door-step, dazed by the immensity of her\ndisappointment, till a burst of loud voices inside the house drove her\ndown the path and out of the gate.\n\nEven then she could not grasp what had happened, and pausing in the road\nshe looked back at the house, half hoping that Mrs. Hochmuller's once\ndetested face might appear at one of the grimy windows.\n\nShe was roused by an icy wind that seemed to spring up suddenly from the\ndesolate scene, piercing her thin dress like gauze; and turning away she\nbegan to retrace her steps. She thought of enquiring for Mrs. Hochmuller\nat some of the neighbouring houses, but their look was so unfriendly\nthat she walked on without making up her mind at which door to ring.\nWhen she reached the horse-car terminus a car was just moving off toward\nHoboken, and for nearly an hour she had to wait on the corner in the\nbitter wind. Her hands and feet were stiff with cold when the car at\nlength loomed into sight again, and she thought of stopping somewhere\non the way to the ferry for a cup of tea; but before the region of\nlunch-rooms was reached she had grown so sick and dizzy that the thought\nof food was repulsive. At length she found herself on the ferry-boat, in\nthe soothing stuffiness of the crowded cabin; then came another interval\nof shivering on a street-corner, another long jolting journey in a\n“cross-town” car that smelt of damp straw and tobacco; and lastly, in\nthe cold spring dusk, she unlocked her door and groped her way through\nthe shop to her fireless bedroom.\n\nThe next morning Mrs. Hawkins, dropping in to hear the result of the\ntrip, found Ann Eliza sitting behind the counter wrapped in an old\nshawl.\n\n“Why, Miss Bunner, you're sick! You must have fever--your face is just\nas red!”\n\n“It's nothing. I guess I caught cold yesterday on the ferry-boat,” Ann\nEliza acknowledged.\n\n“And it's jest like a vault in here!” Mrs. Hawkins rebuked her. “Let me\nfeel your hand--it's burning. Now, Miss Bunner, you've got to go right\nto bed this very minute.”\n\n“Oh, but I can't, Mrs. Hawkins.” Ann Eliza attempted a wan smile. “You\nforget there ain't nobody but me to tend the store.”\n\n“I guess you won't tend it long neither, if you ain't careful,” Mrs.\nHawkins grimly rejoined. Beneath her placid exterior she cherished\na morbid passion for disease and death, and the sight of Ann Eliza's\nsuffering had roused her from her habitual indifference. “There ain't\nso many folks comes to the store anyhow,” she went on with unconscious\ncruelty, “and I'll go right up and see if Miss Mellins can't spare one\nof her girls.”\n\nAnn Eliza, too weary to resist, allowed Mrs. Hawkins to put her to\nbed and make a cup of tea over the stove, while Miss Mellins, always\ngood-naturedly responsive to any appeal for help, sent down the\nweak-eyed little girl to deal with hypothetical customers.\n\nAnn Eliza, having so far abdicated her independence, sank into sudden\napathy. As far as she could remember, it was the first time in her life\nthat she had been taken care of instead of taking care, and there was\na momentary relief in the surrender. She swallowed the tea like an\nobedient child, allowed a poultice to be applied to her aching chest and\nuttered no protest when a fire was kindled in the rarely used grate; but\nas Mrs. Hawkins bent over to “settle” her pillows she raised herself on\nher elbow to whisper: “Oh, Mrs. Hawkins, Mrs. Hochmuller warn't there.”\n The tears rolled down her cheeks.\n\n“She warn't there? Has she moved?”\n\n“Over two months ago--and they don't know where she's gone. Oh what'll I\ndo, Mrs. Hawkins?”\n\n“There, there, Miss Bunner. You lay still and don't fret. I'll ask Mr.\nHawkins soon as ever he comes home.”\n\nAnn Eliza murmured her gratitude, and Mrs. Hawkins, bending down, kissed\nher on the forehead. “Don't you fret,” she repeated, in the voice with\nwhich she soothed her children.\n\nFor over a week Ann Eliza lay in bed, faithfully nursed by her two\nneighbours, while the weak-eyed child, and the pale sewing girl who\nhad helped to finish Evelina's wedding dress, took turns in minding the\nshop. Every morning, when her friends appeared, Ann Eliza lifted her\nhead to ask: “Is there a letter?” and at their gentle negative sank back\nin silence. Mrs. Hawkins, for several days, spoke no more of her promise\nto consult her husband as to the best way of tracing Mrs. Hochmuller;\nand dread of fresh disappointment kept Ann Eliza from bringing up the\nsubject.\n\nBut the following Sunday evening, as she sat for the first time\nbolstered up in her rocking-chair near the stove, while Miss Mellins\nstudied the Police Gazette beneath the lamp, there came a knock on the\nshop-door and Mr. Hawkins entered.\n\nAnn Eliza's first glance at his plain friendly face showed her he had\nnews to give, but though she no longer attempted to hide her anxiety\nfrom Miss Mellins, her lips trembled too much to let her speak.\n\n“Good evening, Miss Bunner,” said Mr. Hawkins in his dragging voice.\n“I've been over to Hoboken all day looking round for Mrs. Hochmuller.”\n\n“Oh, Mr. Hawkins--you HAVE?”\n\n“I made a thorough search, but I'm sorry to say it was no use. She's\nleft Hoboken--moved clear away, and nobody seems to know where.”\n\n“It was real good of you, Mr. Hawkins.” Ann Eliza's voice struggled up\nin a faint whisper through the submerging tide of her disappointment.\n\nMr. Hawkins, in his embarrassed sense of being the bringer of bad news,\nstood before her uncertainly; then he turned to go. “No trouble at all,”\n he paused to assure her from the doorway.\n\nShe wanted to speak again, to detain him, to ask him to advise her; but\nthe words caught in her throat and she lay back silent.\n\nThe next day she got up early, and dressed and bonneted herself with\ntwitching fingers. She waited till the weak-eyed child appeared, and\nhaving laid on her minute instructions as to the care of the shop, she\nslipped out into the street. It had occurred to her in one of the weary\nwatches of the previous night that she might go to Tiffany's and make\nenquiries about Ramy's past. Possibly in that way she might obtain some\ninformation that would suggest a new way of reaching Evelina. She was\nguiltily aware that Mrs. Hawkins and Miss Mellins would be angry with\nher for venturing out of doors, but she knew she should never feel any\nbetter till she had news of Evelina.\n\nThe morning air was sharp, and as she turned to face the wind she felt\nso weak and unsteady that she wondered if she should ever get as far\nas Union Square; but by walking very slowly, and standing still now and\nthen when she could do so without being noticed, she found herself at\nlast before the jeweller's great glass doors.\n\nIt was still so early that there were no purchasers in the shop, and\nshe felt herself the centre of innumerable unemployed eyes as she moved\nforward between long lines of show-cases glittering with diamonds and\nsilver.\n\nShe was glancing about in the hope of finding the clock-department\nwithout having to approach one of the impressive gentlemen who paced\nthe empty aisles, when she attracted the attention of one of the most\nimpressive of the number.\n\nThe formidable benevolence with which he enquired what he could do\nfor her made her almost despair of explaining herself; but she finally\ndisentangled from a flurry of wrong beginnings the request to be shown\nto the clock-department.\n\nThe gentleman considered her thoughtfully. “May I ask what style of\nclock you are looking for? Would it be for a wedding-present, or--?”\n\nThe irony of the allusion filled Ann Eliza's veins with sudden strength.\n“I don't want to buy a clock at all. I want to see the head of the\ndepartment.”\n\n“Mr. Loomis?” His stare still weighed her--then he seemed to brush aside\nthe problem she presented as beneath his notice. “Oh, certainly. Take\nthe elevator to the second floor. Next aisle to the left.” He waved her\ndown the endless perspective of show-cases.\n\nAnn Eliza followed the line of his lordly gesture, and a swift ascent\nbrought her to a great hall full of the buzzing and booming of thousands\nof clocks. Whichever way she looked, clocks stretched away from her in\nglittering interminable vistas: clocks of all sizes and voices, from the\nbell-throated giant of the hallway to the chirping dressing-table toy;\ntall clocks of mahogany and brass with cathedral chimes; clocks\nof bronze, glass, porcelain, of every possible size, voice and\nconfiguration; and between their serried ranks, along the polished\nfloor of the aisles, moved the languid forms of other gentlemanly\nfloor-walkers, waiting for their duties to begin.\n\nOne of them soon approached, and Ann Eliza repeated her request. He\nreceived it affably.\n\n“Mr. Loomis? Go right down to the office at the other end.” He pointed\nto a kind of box of ground glass and highly polished panelling.\n\nAs she thanked him he turned to one of his companions and said something\nin which she caught the name of Mr. Loomis, and which was received with\nan appreciative chuckle. She suspected herself of being the object of\nthe pleasantry, and straightened her thin shoulders under her mantle.\n\nThe door of the office stood open, and within sat a gray-bearded man at\na desk. He looked up kindly, and again she asked for Mr. Loomis.\n\n“I'm Mr. Loomis. What can I do for you?”\n\nHe was much less portentous than the others, though she guessed him\nto be above them in authority; and encouraged by his tone she seated\nherself on the edge of the chair he waved her to.\n\n“I hope you'll excuse my troubling you, sir. I came to ask if you could\ntell me anything about Mr. Herman Ramy. He was employed here in the\nclock-department two or three years ago.”\n\nMr. Loomis showed no recognition of the name.\n\n“Ramy? When was he discharged?”\n\n“I don't har'ly know. He was very sick, and when he got well his place\nhad been filled. He married my sister last October and they went to St.\nLouis, I ain't had any news of them for over two months, and she's my\nonly sister, and I'm most crazy worrying about her.”\n\n“I see.” Mr. Loomis reflected. “In what capacity was Ramy employed\nhere?” he asked after a moment.\n\n“He--he told us that he was one of the heads of the clock-department,”\n Ann Eliza stammered, overswept by a sudden doubt.\n\n“That was probably a slight exaggeration. But I can tell you about him\nby referring to our books. The name again?”\n\n“Ramy--Herman Ramy.”\n\nThere ensued a long silence, broken only by the flutter of leaves as\nMr. Loomis turned over his ledgers. Presently he looked up, keeping his\nfinger between the pages.\n\n“Here it is--Herman Ramy. He was one of our ordinary workmen, and left\nus three years and a half ago last June.”\n\n“On account of sickness?” Ann Eliza faltered.\n\nMr. Loomis appeared to hesitate; then he said: “I see no mention of\nsickness.” Ann Eliza felt his compassionate eyes on her again. “Perhaps\nI'd better tell you the truth. He was discharged for drug-taking. A\ncapable workman, but we couldn't keep him straight. I'm sorry to have to\ntell you this, but it seems fairer, since you say you're anxious about\nyour sister.”\n\nThe polished sides of the office vanished from Ann Eliza's sight, and\nthe cackle of the innumerable clocks came to her like the yell of waves\nin a storm. She tried to speak but could not; tried to get to her feet,\nbut the floor was gone.\n\n“I'm very sorry,” Mr. Loomis repeated, closing the ledger. “I remember\nthe man perfectly now. He used to disappear every now and then, and turn\nup again in a state that made him useless for days.”\n\nAs she listened, Ann Eliza recalled the day when she had come on Mr.\nRamy sitting in abject dejection behind his counter. She saw again the\nblurred unrecognizing eyes he had raised to her, the layer of dust\nover everything in the shop, and the green bronze clock in the window\nrepresenting a Newfoundland dog with his paw on a book. She stood up\nslowly.\n\n“Thank you. I'm sorry to have troubled you.”\n\n“It was no trouble. You say Ramy married your sister last October?”\n\n“Yes, sir; and they went to St. Louis right afterward. I don't know how\nto find her. I thought maybe somebody here might know about him.”\n\n“Well, possibly some of the workmen might. Leave me your name and I'll\nsend you word if I get on his track.”\n\nHe handed her a pencil, and she wrote down her address; then she walked\naway blindly between the clocks.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nMr. Loomis, true to his word, wrote a few days later that he had\nenquired in vain in the work-shop for any news of Ramy; and as she\nfolded this letter and laid it between the leaves of her Bible, Ann\nEliza felt that her last hope was gone. Miss Mellins, of course, had\nlong since suggested the mediation of the police, and cited from her\nfavourite literature convincing instances of the supernatural ability of\nthe Pinkerton detective; but Mr. Hawkins, when called in council, dashed\nthis project by remarking that detectives cost something like twenty\ndollars a day; and a vague fear of the law, some half-formed vision of\nEvelina in the clutch of a blue-coated “officer,” kept Ann Eliza from\ninvoking the aid of the police.\n\nAfter the arrival of Mr. Loomis's note the weeks followed each other\nuneventfully. Ann Eliza's cough clung to her till late in the spring,\nthe reflection in her looking-glass grew more bent and meagre, and her\nforehead sloped back farther toward the twist of hair that was fastened\nabove her parting by a comb of black India-rubber.\n\nToward spring a lady who was expecting a baby took up her abode at the\nMendoza Family Hotel, and through the friendly intervention of Miss\nMellins the making of some of the baby-clothes was entrusted to Ann\nEliza. This eased her of anxiety for the immediate future; but she had\nto rouse herself to feel any sense of relief. Her personal welfare was\nwhat least concerned her. Sometimes she thought of giving up the shop\naltogether; and only the fear that, if she changed her address, Evelina\nmight not be able to find her, kept her from carrying out this plan.\n\nSince she had lost her last hope of tracing her sister, all the\nactivities of her lonely imagination had been concentrated on the\npossibility of Evelina's coming back to her. The discovery of Ramy's\nsecret filled her with dreadful fears. In the solitude of the shop\nand the back room she was tortured by vague pictures of Evelina's\nsufferings. What horrors might not be hidden beneath her silence? Ann\nEliza's great dread was that Miss Mellins should worm out of her what\nshe had learned from Mr. Loomis. She was sure Miss Mellins must have\nabominable things to tell about drug-fiends--things she did not have\nthe strength to hear. “Drug-fiend”--the very word was Satanic; she\ncould hear Miss Mellins roll it on her tongue. But Ann Eliza's own\nimagination, left to itself, had begun to people the long hours with\nevil visions. Sometimes, in the night, she thought she heard herself\ncalled: the voice was her sister's, but faint with a nameless terror.\nHer most peaceful moments were those in which she managed to convince\nherself that Evelina was dead. She thought of her then, mournfully but\nmore calmly, as thrust away under the neglected mound of some unknown\ncemetery, where no headstone marked her name, no mourner with flowers\nfor another grave paused in pity to lay a blossom on hers. But this\nvision did not often give Ann Eliza its negative relief; and always,\nbeneath its hazy lines, lurked the dark conviction that Evelina was\nalive, in misery and longing for her.\n\nSo the summer wore on. Ann Eliza was conscious that Mrs. Hawkins and\nMiss Mellins were watching her with affectionate anxiety, but the\nknowledge brought no comfort. She no longer cared what they felt or\nthought about her. Her grief lay far beyond touch of human healing, and\nafter a while she became aware that they knew they could not help her.\nThey still came in as often as their busy lives permitted, but their\nvisits grew shorter, and Mrs. Hawkins always brought Arthur or the baby,\nso that there should be something to talk about, and some one whom she\ncould scold.\n\nThe autumn came, and the winter. Business had fallen off again, and but\nfew purchasers came to the little shop in the basement. In January Ann\nEliza pawned her mother's cashmere scarf, her mosaic brooch, and the\nrosewood what-not on which the clock had always stood; she would\nhave sold the bedstead too, but for the persistent vision of Evelina\nreturning weak and weary, and not knowing where to lay her head.\n\nThe winter passed in its turn, and March reappeared with its galaxies of\nyellow jonquils at the windy street corners, reminding Ann Eliza of the\nspring day when Evelina had come home with a bunch of jonquils in her\nhand. In spite of the flowers which lent such a premature brightness to\nthe streets the month was fierce and stormy, and Ann Eliza could get\nno warmth into her bones. Nevertheless, she was insensibly beginning to\ntake up the healing routine of life. Little by little she had grown used\nto being alone, she had begun to take a languid interest in the one or\ntwo new purchasers the season had brought, and though the thought\nof Evelina was as poignant as ever, it was less persistently in the\nforeground of her mind.\n\nLate one afternoon she was sitting behind the counter, wrapped in her\nshawl, and wondering how soon she might draw down the blinds and retreat\ninto the comparative cosiness of the back room. She was not thinking of\nanything in particular, except perhaps in a hazy way of the lady with\nthe puffed sleeves, who after her long eclipse had reappeared the day\nbefore in sleeves of a new cut, and bought some tape and needles. The\nlady still wore mourning, but she was evidently lightening it, and Ann\nEliza saw in this the hope of future orders. The lady had left the shop\nabout an hour before, walking away with her graceful step toward Fifth\nAvenue. She had wished Ann Eliza good day in her usual affable way, and\nAnn Eliza thought how odd it was that they should have been acquainted\nso long, and yet that she should not know the lady's name. From this\nconsideration her mind wandered to the cut of the lady's new sleeves,\nand she was vexed with herself for not having noted it more carefully.\nShe felt Miss Mellins might have liked to know about it. Ann Eliza's\npowers of observation had never been as keen as Evelina's, when the\nlatter was not too self-absorbed to exert them. As Miss Mellins always\nsaid, Evelina could “take patterns with her eyes”: she could have cut\nthat new sleeve out of a folded newspaper in a trice! Musing on these\nthings, Ann Eliza wished the lady would come back and give her another\nlook at the sleeve. It was not unlikely that she might pass that way,\nfor she certainly lived in or about the Square. Suddenly Ann Eliza\nremarked a small neat handkerchief on the counter: it must have dropped\nfrom the lady's purse, and she would probably come back to get it. Ann\nEliza, pleased at the idea, sat on behind the counter and watched the\ndarkening street. She always lit the gas as late as possible, keeping\nthe box of matches at her elbow, so that if any one came she could apply\na quick flame to the gas-jet. At length through the deepening dusk she\ndistinguished a slim dark figure coming down the steps to the shop. With\na little warmth of pleasure about her heart she reached up to light the\ngas. “I do believe I'll ask her name this time,” she thought. She raised\nthe flame to its full height, and saw her sister standing in the door.\n\nThere she was at last, the poor pale shade of Evelina, her thin face\nblanched of its faint pink, the stiff ripples gone from her hair, and a\nmantle shabbier than Ann Eliza's drawn about her narrow shoulders. The\nglare of the gas beat full on her as she stood and looked at Ann Eliza.\n\n“Sister--oh, Evelina! I knowed you'd come!”\n\nAnn Eliza had caught her close with a long moan of triumph. Vague\nwords poured from her as she laid her cheek against Evelina's--trivial\ninarticulate endearments caught from Mrs. Hawkins's long discourses to\nher baby.\n\nFor a while Evelina let herself be passively held; then she drew back\nfrom her sister's clasp and looked about the shop. “I'm dead tired.\nAin't there any fire?” she asked.\n\n“Of course there is!” Ann Eliza, holding her hand fast, drew her into\nthe back room. She did not want to ask any questions yet: she simply\nwanted to feel the emptiness of the room brimmed full again by the one\npresence that was warmth and light to her.\n\nShe knelt down before the grate, scraped some bits of coal and kindling\nfrom the bottom of the coal-scuttle, and drew one of the rocking-chairs\nup to the weak flame. “There--that'll blaze up in a minute,” she said.\nShe pressed Evelina down on the faded cushions of the rocking-chair,\nand, kneeling beside her, began to rub her hands.\n\n“You're stone-cold, ain't you? Just sit still and warm yourself while I\nrun and get the kettle. I've got something you always used to fancy for\nsupper.” She laid her hand on Evelina's shoulder. “Don't talk--oh, don't\ntalk yet!” she implored. She wanted to keep that one frail second of\nhappiness between herself and what she knew must come.\n\nEvelina, without a word, bent over the fire, stretching her thin hands\nto the blaze and watching Ann Eliza fill the kettle and set the supper\ntable. Her gaze had the dreamy fixity of a half-awakened child's.\n\nAnn Eliza, with a smile of triumph, brought a slice of custard pie from\nthe cupboard and put it by her sister's plate.\n\n“You do like that, don't you? Miss Mellins sent it down to me this\nmorning. She had her aunt from Brooklyn to dinner. Ain't it funny it\njust so happened?”\n\n“I ain't hungry,” said Evelina, rising to approach the table.\n\nShe sat down in her usual place, looked about her with the same\nwondering stare, and then, as of old, poured herself out the first cup\nof tea.\n\n“Where's the what-not gone to?” she suddenly asked.\n\nAnn Eliza set down the teapot and rose to get a spoon from the cupboard.\nWith her back to the room she said: “The what-not? Why, you see, dearie,\nliving here all alone by myself it only made one more thing to dust; so\nI sold it.”\n\nEvelina's eyes were still travelling about the familiar room. Though\nit was against all the traditions of the Bunner family to sell any\nhousehold possession, she showed no surprise at her sister's answer.\n\n“And the clock? The clock's gone too.”\n\n“Oh, I gave that away--I gave it to Mrs. Hawkins. She's kep' awake so\nnights with that last baby.”\n\n“I wish you'd never bought it,” said Evelina harshly.\n\nAnn Eliza's heart grew faint with fear. Without answering, she crossed\nover to her sister's seat and poured her out a second cup of tea. Then\nanother thought struck her, and she went back to the cupboard and took\nout the cordial. In Evelina's absence considerable draughts had been\ndrawn from it by invalid neighbours; but a glassful of the precious\nliquid still remained.\n\n“Here, drink this right off--it'll warm you up quicker than anything,”\n Ann Eliza said.\n\nEvelina obeyed, and a slight spark of colour came into her cheeks.\nShe turned to the custard pie and began to eat with a silent voracity\ndistressing to watch. She did not even look to see what was left for Ann\nEliza.\n\n“I ain't hungry,” she said at last as she laid down her fork. “I'm only\nso dead tired--that's the trouble.”\n\n“Then you'd better get right into bed. Here's my old plaid\ndressing-gown--you remember it, don't you?” Ann Eliza laughed, recalling\nEvelina's ironies on the subject of the antiquated garment. With\ntrembling fingers she began to undo her sister's cloak. The dress\nbeneath it told a tale of poverty that Ann Eliza dared not pause to\nnote. She drew it gently off, and as it slipped from Evelina's shoulders\nit revealed a tiny black bag hanging on a ribbon about her neck. Evelina\nlifted her hand as though to screen the bag from Ann Eliza; and the\nelder sister, seeing the gesture, continued her task with lowered eyes.\nShe undressed Evelina as quickly as she could, and wrapping her in the\nplaid dressing-gown put her to bed, and spread her own shawl and her\nsister's cloak above the blanket.\n\n“Where's the old red comfortable?” Evelina asked, as she sank down on\nthe pillow.\n\n“The comfortable? Oh, it was so hot and heavy I never used it after you\nwent--so I sold that too. I never could sleep under much clothes.”\n\nShe became aware that her sister was looking at her more attentively.\n\n“I guess you've been in trouble too,” Evelina said.\n\n“Me? In trouble? What do you mean, Evelina?”\n\n“You've had to pawn the things, I suppose,” Evelina continued in a weary\nunmoved tone. “Well, I've been through worse than that. I've been to\nhell and back.”\n\n“Oh, Evelina--don't say it, sister!” Ann Eliza implored, shrinking\nfrom the unholy word. She knelt down and began to rub her sister's feet\nbeneath the bedclothes.\n\n“I've been to hell and back--if I AM back,” Evelina repeated. She\nlifted her head from the pillow and began to talk with a sudden feverish\nvolubility. “It began right away, less than a month after we were\nmarried. I've been in hell all that time, Ann Eliza.” She fixed her eyes\nwith passionate intentness on Ann Eliza's face. “He took opium. I didn't\nfind it out till long afterward--at first, when he acted so strange, I\nthought he drank. But it was worse, much worse than drinking.”\n\n“Oh, sister, don't say it--don't say it yet! It's so sweet just to have\nyou here with me again.”\n\n“I must say it,” Evelina insisted, her flushed face burning with a kind\nof bitter cruelty. “You don't know what life's like--you don't know\nanything about it--setting here safe all the while in this peaceful\nplace.”\n\n“Oh, Evelina--why didn't you write and send for me if it was like that?”\n\n“That's why I couldn't write. Didn't you guess I was ashamed?”\n\n“How could you be? Ashamed to write to Ann Eliza?”\n\nEvelina raised herself on her thin elbow, while Ann Eliza, bending over,\ndrew a corner of the shawl about her shoulder.\n\n“Do lay down again. You'll catch your death.”\n\n“My death? That don't frighten me! You don't know what I've been\nthrough.” And sitting upright in the old mahogany bed, with flushed\ncheeks and chattering teeth, and Ann Eliza's trembling arm clasping the\nshawl about her neck, Evelina poured out her story. It was a tale\nof misery and humiliation so remote from the elder sister's innocent\nexperiences that much of it was hardly intelligible to her. Evelina's\ndreadful familiarity with it all, her fluency about things which Ann\nEliza half-guessed and quickly shuddered back from, seemed even more\nalien and terrible than the actual tale she told. It was one thing--and\nheaven knew it was bad enough!--to learn that one's sister's husband was\na drug-fiend; it was another, and much worse thing, to learn from that\nsister's pallid lips what vileness lay behind the word.\n\nEvelina, unconscious of any distress but her own, sat upright, shivering\nin Ann Eliza's hold, while she piled up, detail by detail, her dreary\nnarrative.\n\n“The minute we got out there, and he found the job wasn't as good as he\nexpected, he changed. At first I thought he was sick--I used to try to\nkeep him home and nurse him. Then I saw it was something different.\nHe used to go off for hours at a time, and when he came back his eyes\nkinder had a fog over them. Sometimes he didn't har'ly know me, and\nwhen he did he seemed to hate me. Once he hit me here.” She touched her\nbreast. “Do you remember, Ann Eliza, that time he didn't come to see us\nfor a week--the time after we all went to Central Park together--and you\nand I thought he must be sick?”\n\nAnn Eliza nodded.\n\n“Well, that was the trouble--he'd been at it then. But nothing like as\nbad. After we'd been out there about a month he disappeared for a whole\nweek. They took him back at the store, and gave him another chance; but\nthe second time they discharged him, and he drifted round for ever so\nlong before he could get another job. We spent all our money and had to\nmove to a cheaper place. Then he got something to do, but they hardly\npaid him anything, and he didn't stay there long. When he found out\nabout the baby--”\n\n“The baby?” Ann Eliza faltered.\n\n“It's dead--it only lived a day. When he found out about it, he got mad,\nand said he hadn't any money to pay doctors' bills, and I'd better\nwrite to you to help us. He had an idea you had money hidden away that\nI didn't know about.” She turned to her sister with remorseful eyes. “It\nwas him that made me get that hundred dollars out of you.”\n\n“Hush, hush. I always meant it for you anyhow.”\n\n“Yes, but I wouldn't have taken it if he hadn't been at me the whole\ntime. He used to make me do just what he wanted. Well, when I said I\nwouldn't write to you for more money he said I'd better try and earn\nsome myself. That was when he struck me.... Oh, you don't know what I'm\ntalking about yet!... I tried to get work at a milliner's, but I was so\nsick I couldn't stay. I was sick all the time. I wisht I'd ha' died, Ann\nEliza.”\n\n“No, no, Evelina.”\n\n“Yes, I do. It kept getting worse and worse. We pawned the furniture,\nand they turned us out because we couldn't pay the rent; and so then we\nwent to board with Mrs. Hochmuller.”\n\nAnn Eliza pressed her closer to dissemble her own tremor. “Mrs.\nHochmuller?”\n\n“Didn't you know she was out there? She moved out a month after we did.\nShe wasn't bad to me, and I think she tried to keep him straight--but\nLinda--”\n\n“Linda--?”\n\n“Well, when I kep' getting worse, and he was always off, for days at a\ntime, the doctor had me sent to a hospital.”\n\n“A hospital? Sister--sister!”\n\n“It was better than being with him; and the doctors were real kind to\nme. After the baby was born I was very sick and had to stay there a good\nwhile. And one day when I was laying there Mrs. Hochmuller came in as\nwhite as a sheet, and told me him and Linda had gone off together and\ntaken all her money. That's the last I ever saw of him.” She broke off\nwith a laugh and began to cough again.\n\nAnn Eliza tried to persuade her to lie down and sleep, but the rest of\nher story had to be told before she could be soothed into consent. After\nthe news of Ramy's flight she had had brain fever, and had been sent\nto another hospital where she stayed a long time--how long she couldn't\nremember. Dates and days meant nothing to her in the shapeless ruin of\nher life. When she left the hospital she found that Mrs. Hochmuller had\ngone too. She was penniless, and had no one to turn to. A lady visitor\nat the hospital was kind, and found her a place where she did housework;\nbut she was so weak they couldn't keep her. Then she got a job as\nwaitress in a down-town lunch-room, but one day she fainted while she\nwas handing a dish, and that evening when they paid her they told her\nshe needn't come again.\n\n“After that I begged in the streets”--(Ann Eliza's grasp again grew\ntight)--“and one afternoon last week, when the matinees was coming out,\nI met a man with a pleasant face, something like Mr. Hawkins, and he\nstopped and asked me what the trouble was. I told him if he'd give me\nfive dollars I'd have money enough to buy a ticket back to New York, and\nhe took a good look at me and said, well, if that was what I wanted he'd\ngo straight to the station with me and give me the five dollars there.\nSo he did--and he bought the ticket, and put me in the cars.”\n\nEvelina sank back, her face a sallow wedge in the white cleft of the\npillow. Ann Eliza leaned over her, and for a long time they held each\nother without speaking.\n\nThey were still clasped in this dumb embrace when there was a step in\nthe shop and Ann Eliza, starting up, saw Miss Mellins in the doorway.\n\n“My sakes, Miss Bunner! What in the land are you doing? Miss\nEvelina--Mrs. Ramy--it ain't you?”\n\nMiss Mellins's eyes, bursting from their sockets, sprang from Evelina's\npallid face to the disordered supper table and the heap of worn clothes\non the floor; then they turned back to Ann Eliza, who had placed herself\non the defensive between her sister and the dress-maker.\n\n“My sister Evelina has come back--come back on a visit. She was taken\nsick in the cars on the way home--I guess she caught cold--so I made her\ngo right to bed as soon as ever she got here.”\n\nAnn Eliza was surprised at the strength and steadiness of her voice.\nFortified by its sound she went on, her eyes on Miss Mellins's baffled\ncountenance: “Mr. Ramy has gone west on a trip--a trip connected with\nhis business; and Evelina is going to stay with me till he comes back.”\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nWhat measure of belief her explanation of Evelina's return obtained\nin the small circle of her friends Ann Eliza did not pause to enquire.\nThough she could not remember ever having told a lie before, she adhered\nwith rigid tenacity to the consequences of her first lapse from truth,\nand fortified her original statement with additional details whenever a\nquestioner sought to take her unawares.\n\nBut other and more serious burdens lay on her startled conscience. For\nthe first time in her life she dimly faced the awful problem of\nthe inutility of self-sacrifice. Hitherto she had never thought\nof questioning the inherited principles which had guided her life.\nSelf-effacement for the good of others had always seemed to her both\nnatural and necessary; but then she had taken it for granted that it\nimplied the securing of that good. Now she perceived that to refuse the\ngifts of life does not ensure their transmission to those for whom they\nhave been surrendered; and her familiar heaven was unpeopled. She felt\nshe could no longer trust in the goodness of God, and there was only a\nblack abyss above the roof of Bunner Sisters.\n\nBut there was little time to brood upon such problems. The care of\nEvelina filled Ann Eliza's days and nights. The hastily summoned doctor\nhad pronounced her to be suffering from pneumonia, and under his care\nthe first stress of the disease was relieved. But her recovery was only\npartial, and long after the doctor's visits had ceased she continued to\nlie in bed, too weak to move, and seemingly indifferent to everything\nabout her.\n\nAt length one evening, about six weeks after her return, she said to her\nsister: “I don't feel's if I'd ever get up again.”\n\nAnn Eliza turned from the kettle she was placing on the stove. She was\nstartled by the echo the words woke in her own breast.\n\n“Don't you talk like that, Evelina! I guess you're on'y tired out--and\ndisheartened.”\n\n“Yes, I'm disheartened,” Evelina murmured.\n\nA few months earlier Ann Eliza would have met the confession with a word\nof pious admonition; now she accepted it in silence.\n\n“Maybe you'll brighten up when your cough gets better,” she suggested.\n\n“Yes--or my cough'll get better when I brighten up,” Evelina retorted\nwith a touch of her old tartness.\n\n“Does your cough keep on hurting you jest as much?”\n\n“I don't see's there's much difference.”\n\n“Well, I guess I'll get the doctor to come round again,” Ann Eliza said,\ntrying for the matter-of-course tone in which one might speak of sending\nfor the plumber or the gas-fitter.\n\n“It ain't any use sending for the doctor--and who's going to pay him?”\n\n“I am,” answered the elder sister. “Here's your tea, and a mite of\ntoast. Don't that tempt you?”\n\nAlready, in the watches of the night, Ann Eliza had been tormented by\nthat same question--who was to pay the doctor?--and a few days before\nshe had temporarily silenced it by borrowing twenty dollars of Miss\nMellins. The transaction had cost her one of the bitterest struggles\nof her life. She had never borrowed a penny of any one before, and the\npossibility of having to do so had always been classed in her mind\namong those shameful extremities to which Providence does not let\ndecent people come. But nowadays she no longer believed in the personal\nsupervision of Providence; and had she been compelled to steal the money\ninstead of borrowing it, she would have felt that her conscience was the\nonly tribunal before which she had to answer. Nevertheless, the actual\nhumiliation of having to ask for the money was no less bitter; and she\ncould hardly hope that Miss Mellins would view the case with the\nsame detachment as herself. Miss Mellins was very kind; but she not\nunnaturally felt that her kindness should be rewarded by according\nher the right to ask questions; and bit by bit Ann Eliza saw Evelina's\nmiserable secret slipping into the dress-maker's possession.\n\nWhen the doctor came she left him alone with Evelina, busying herself in\nthe shop that she might have an opportunity of seeing him alone on his\nway out. To steady herself she began to sort a trayful of buttons, and\nwhen the doctor appeared she was reciting under her breath: “Twenty-four\nhorn, two and a half cards fancy pearl...” She saw at once that his look\nwas grave.\n\nHe sat down on the chair beside the counter, and her mind travelled\nmiles before he spoke.\n\n“Miss Bunner, the best thing you can do is to let me get a bed for your\nsister at St. Luke's.”\n\n“The hospital?”\n\n“Come now, you're above that sort of prejudice, aren't you?” The doctor\nspoke in the tone of one who coaxes a spoiled child. “I know how devoted\nyou are--but Mrs. Ramy can be much better cared for there than here.\nYou really haven't time to look after her and attend to your business as\nwell. There'll be no expense, you understand--”\n\nAnn Eliza made no answer. “You think my sister's going to be sick a good\nwhile, then?” she asked.\n\n“Well, yes--possibly.”\n\n“You think she's very sick?”\n\n“Well, yes. She's very sick.”\n\nHis face had grown still graver; he sat there as though he had never\nknown what it was to hurry.\n\nAnn Eliza continued to separate the pearl and horn buttons. Suddenly she\nlifted her eyes and looked at him. “Is she going to die?”\n\nThe doctor laid a kindly hand on hers. “We never say that, Miss Bunner.\nHuman skill works wonders--and at the hospital Mrs. Ramy would have\nevery chance.”\n\n“What is it? What's she dying of?”\n\nThe doctor hesitated, seeking to substitute a popular phrase for the\nscientific terminology which rose to his lips.\n\n“I want to know,” Ann Eliza persisted.\n\n“Yes, of course; I understand. Well, your sister has had a hard\ntime lately, and there is a complication of causes, resulting in\nconsumption--rapid consumption. At the hospital--”\n\n“I'll keep her here,” said Ann Eliza quietly.\n\nAfter the doctor had gone she went on for some time sorting the buttons;\nthen she slipped the tray into its place on a shelf behind the counter\nand went into the back room. She found Evelina propped upright against\nthe pillows, a flush of agitation on her cheeks. Ann Eliza pulled up the\nshawl which had slipped from her sister's shoulders.\n\n“How long you've been! What's he been saying?”\n\n“Oh, he went long ago--he on'y stopped to give me a prescription. I was\nsorting out that tray of buttons. Miss Mellins's girl got them all mixed\nup.”\n\nShe felt Evelina's eyes upon her.\n\n“He must have said something: what was it?”\n\n“Why, he said you'd have to be careful--and stay in bed--and take this\nnew medicine he's given you.”\n\n“Did he say I was going to get well?”\n\n“Why, Evelina!”\n\n“What's the use, Ann Eliza? You can't deceive me. I've just been up to\nlook at myself in the glass; and I saw plenty of 'em in the hospital\nthat looked like me. They didn't get well, and I ain't going to.” Her\nhead dropped back. “It don't much matter--I'm about tired. On'y there's\none thing--Ann Eliza--”\n\nThe elder sister drew near to the bed.\n\n“There's one thing I ain't told you. I didn't want to tell you yet\nbecause I was afraid you might be sorry--but if he says I'm going to\ndie I've got to say it.” She stopped to cough, and to Ann Eliza it now\nseemed as though every cough struck a minute from the hours remaining to\nher.\n\n“Don't talk now--you're tired.”\n\n“I'll be tireder to-morrow, I guess. And I want you should know. Sit\ndown close to me--there.”\n\nAnn Eliza sat down in silence, stroking her shrunken hand.\n\n“I'm a Roman Catholic, Ann Eliza.”\n\n“Evelina--oh, Evelina Bunner! A Roman Catholic--YOU? Oh, Evelina, did HE\nmake you?”\n\nEvelina shook her head. “I guess he didn't have no religion; he never\nspoke of it. But you see Mrs. Hochmuller was a Catholic, and so when I\nwas sick she got the doctor to send me to a Roman Catholic hospital,\nand the sisters was so good to me there--and the priest used to come and\ntalk to me; and the things he said kep' me from going crazy. He seemed\nto make everything easier.”\n\n“Oh, sister, how could you?” Ann Eliza wailed. She knew little of the\nCatholic religion except that “Papists” believed in it--in itself a\nsufficient indictment. Her spiritual rebellion had not freed her from\nthe formal part of her religious belief, and apostasy had always seemed\nto her one of the sins from which the pure in mind avert their thoughts.\n\n“And then when the baby was born,” Evelina continued, “he christened it\nright away, so it could go to heaven; and after that, you see, I had to\nbe a Catholic.”\n\n“I don't see--”\n\n“Don't I have to be where the baby is? I couldn't ever ha' gone there if\nI hadn't been made a Catholic. Don't you understand that?”\n\nAnn Eliza sat speechless, drawing her hand away. Once more she\nfound herself shut out of Evelina's heart, an exile from her closest\naffections.\n\n“I've got to go where the baby is,” Evelina feverishly insisted.\n\nAnn Eliza could think of nothing to say; she could only feel that\nEvelina was dying, and dying as a stranger in her arms. Ramy and the\nday-old baby had parted her forever from her sister.\n\nEvelina began again. “If I get worse I want you to send for a priest.\nMiss Mellins'll know where to send--she's got an aunt that's a Catholic.\nPromise me faithful you will.”\n\n“I promise,” said Ann Eliza.\n\nAfter that they spoke no more of the matter; but Ann Eliza now\nunderstood that the little black bag about her sister's neck, which\nshe had innocently taken for a memento of Ramy, was some kind of\nsacrilegious amulet, and her fingers shrank from its contact when she\nbathed and dressed Evelina. It seemed to her the diabolical instrument\nof their estrangement.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nSpring had really come at last. There were leaves on the ailanthus-tree\nthat Evelina could see from her bed, gentle clouds floated over it in\nthe blue, and now and then the cry of a flower-seller sounded from the\nstreet.\n\nOne day there was a shy knock on the back-room door, and Johnny Hawkins\ncame in with two yellow jonquils in his fist. He was getting bigger and\nsquarer, and his round freckled face was growing into a smaller copy of\nhis father's. He walked up to Evelina and held out the flowers.\n\n“They blew off the cart and the fellow said I could keep 'em. But you\ncan have 'em,” he announced.\n\nAnn Eliza rose from her seat at the sewing-machine and tried to take the\nflowers from him.\n\n“They ain't for you; they're for her,” he sturdily objected; and Evelina\nheld out her hand for the jonquils.\n\nAfter Johnny had gone she lay and looked at them without speaking. Ann\nEliza, who had gone back to the machine, bent her head over the seam she\nwas stitching; the click, click, click of the machine sounded in her ear\nlike the tick of Ramy's clock, and it seemed to her that life had gone\nbackward, and that Evelina, radiant and foolish, had just come into the\nroom with the yellow flowers in her hand.\n\nWhen at last she ventured to look up, she saw that her sister's head\nhad drooped against the pillow, and that she was sleeping quietly. Her\nrelaxed hand still held the jonquils, but it was evident that they had\nawakened no memories; she had dozed off almost as soon as Johnny had\ngiven them to her. The discovery gave Ann Eliza a startled sense of the\nruins that must be piled upon her past. “I don't believe I could have\nforgotten that day, though,” she said to herself. But she was glad that\nEvelina had forgotten.\n\nEvelina's disease moved on along the usual course, now lifting her on a\nbrief wave of elation, now sinking her to new depths of weakness.\nThere was little to be done, and the doctor came only at lengthening\nintervals. On his way out he always repeated his first friendly\nsuggestion about sending Evelina to the hospital; and Ann Eliza always\nanswered: “I guess we can manage.”\n\nThe hours passed for her with the fierce rapidity that great joy or\nanguish lends them. She went through the days with a sternly smiling\nprecision, but she hardly knew what was happening, and when night-fall\nreleased her from the shop, and she could carry her work to Evelina's\nbedside, the same sense of unreality accompanied her, and she still\nseemed to be accomplishing a task whose object had escaped her memory.\n\nOnce, when Evelina felt better, she expressed a desire to make some\nartificial flowers, and Ann Eliza, deluded by this awakening interest,\ngot out the faded bundles of stems and petals and the little tools and\nspools of wire. But after a few minutes the work dropped from Evelina's\nhands and she said: “I'll wait until to-morrow.”\n\nShe never again spoke of the flower-making, but one day, after watching\nAnn Eliza's laboured attempt to trim a spring hat for Mrs. Hawkins, she\ndemanded impatiently that the hat should be brought to her, and in a\ntrice had galvanized the lifeless bow and given the brim the twist it\nneeded.\n\nThese were rare gleams; and more frequent were the days of speechless\nlassitude, when she lay for hours silently staring at the window, shaken\nonly by the hard incessant cough that sounded to Ann Eliza like the\nhammering of nails into a coffin.\n\nAt length one morning Ann Eliza, starting up from the mattress at the\nfoot of the bed, hastily called Miss Mellins down, and ran through the\nsmoky dawn for the doctor. He came back with her and did what he could\nto give Evelina momentary relief; then he went away, promising to\nlook in again before night. Miss Mellins, her head still covered with\ncurl-papers, disappeared in his wake, and when the sisters were alone\nEvelina beckoned to Ann Eliza.\n\n“You promised,” she whispered, grasping her sister's arm; and Ann Eliza\nunderstood. She had not yet dared to tell Miss Mellins of Evelina's\nchange of faith; it had seemed even more difficult than borrowing the\nmoney; but now it had to be done. She ran upstairs after the dress-maker\nand detained her on the landing.\n\n“Miss Mellins, can you tell me where to send for a priest--a Roman\nCatholic priest?”\n\n“A priest, Miss Bunner?”\n\n“Yes. My sister became a Roman Catholic while she was away. They were\nkind to her in her sickness--and now she wants a priest.” Ann Eliza\nfaced Miss Mellins with unflinching eyes.\n\n“My aunt Dugan'll know. I'll run right round to her the minute I get my\npapers off,” the dress-maker promised; and Ann Eliza thanked her.\n\nAn hour or two later the priest appeared. Ann Eliza, who was watching,\nsaw him coming down the steps to the shop-door and went to meet him. His\nexpression was kind, but she shrank from his peculiar dress, and from\nhis pale face with its bluish chin and enigmatic smile. Ann Eliza\nremained in the shop. Miss Mellins's girl had mixed the buttons again\nand she set herself to sort them. The priest stayed a long time with\nEvelina. When he again carried his enigmatic smile past the counter, and\nAnn Eliza rejoined her sister, Evelina was smiling with something of the\nsame mystery; but she did not tell her secret.\n\nAfter that it seemed to Ann Eliza that the shop and the back room no\nlonger belonged to her. It was as though she were there on sufferance,\nindulgently tolerated by the unseen power which hovered over Evelina\neven in the absence of its minister. The priest came almost daily; and\nat last a day arrived when he was called to administer some rite of\nwhich Ann Eliza but dimly grasped the sacramental meaning. All she knew\nwas that it meant that Evelina was going, and going, under this alien\nguidance, even farther from her than to the dark places of death.\n\nWhen the priest came, with something covered in his hands, she crept\ninto the shop, closing the door of the back room to leave him alone with\nEvelina.\n\nIt was a warm afternoon in May, and the crooked ailanthus-tree rooted in\na fissure of the opposite pavement was a fountain of tender green. Women\nin light dresses passed with the languid step of spring; and presently\nthere came a man with a hand-cart full of pansy and geranium plants who\nstopped outside the window, signalling to Ann Eliza to buy.\n\nAn hour went by before the door of the back room opened and the priest\nreappeared with that mysterious covered something in his hands. Ann\nEliza had risen, drawing back as he passed. He had doubtless divined her\nantipathy, for he had hitherto only bowed in going in and out; but to\nday he paused and looked at her compassionately.\n\n“I have left your sister in a very beautiful state of mind,” he said in\na low voice like a woman's. “She is full of spiritual consolation.”\n\nAnn Eliza was silent, and he bowed and went out. She hastened back to\nEvelina's bed, and knelt down beside it. Evelina's eyes were very\nlarge and bright; she turned them on Ann Eliza with a look of inner\nillumination.\n\n“I shall see the baby,” she said; then her eyelids fell and she dozed.\n\nThe doctor came again at nightfall, administering some last palliatives;\nand after he had gone Ann Eliza, refusing to have her vigil shared by\nMiss Mellins or Mrs. Hawkins, sat down to keep watch alone.\n\nIt was a very quiet night. Evelina never spoke or opened her eyes,\nbut in the still hour before dawn Ann Eliza saw that the restless hand\noutside the bed-clothes had stopped its twitching. She stooped over and\nfelt no breath on her sister's lips.\n\n\nThe funeral took place three days later. Evelina was buried in\nCalvary Cemetery, the priest assuming the whole care of the necessary\narrangements, while Ann Eliza, a passive spectator, beheld with stony\nindifference this last negation of her past.\n\nA week afterward she stood in her bonnet and mantle in the doorway of\nthe little shop. Its whole aspect had changed. Counter and shelves were\nbare, the window was stripped of its familiar miscellany of artificial\nflowers, note-paper, wire hat-frames, and limp garments from the dyer's;\nand against the glass pane of the doorway hung a sign: “This store to\nlet.”\n\nAnn Eliza turned her eyes from the sign as she went out and locked the\ndoor behind her. Evelina's funeral had been very expensive, and Ann\nEliza, having sold her stock-in-trade and the few articles of furniture\nthat remained to her, was leaving the shop for the last time. She had\nnot been able to buy any mourning, but Miss Mellins had sewed some crape\non her old black mantle and bonnet, and having no gloves she slipped her\nbare hands under the folds of the mantle.\n\nIt was a beautiful morning, and the air was full of a warm sunshine that\nhad coaxed open nearly every window in the street, and summoned to the\nwindow-sills the sickly plants nurtured indoors in winter. Ann Eliza's\nway lay westward, toward Broadway; but at the corner she paused and\nlooked back down the familiar length of the street. Her eyes rested a\nmoment on the blotched “Bunner Sisters” above the empty window of the\nshop; then they travelled on to the overflowing foliage of the Square,\nabove which was the church tower with the dial that had marked the hours\nfor the sisters before Ann Eliza had bought the nickel clock. She looked\nat it all as though it had been the scene of some unknown life, of which\nthe vague report had reached her: she felt for herself the only remote\npity that busy people accord to the misfortunes which come to them by\nhearsay.\n\nShe walked to Broadway and down to the office of the house-agent to whom\nshe had entrusted the sub-letting of the shop. She left the key with\none of his clerks, who took it from her as if it had been any one of a\nthousand others, and remarked that the weather looked as if spring\nwas really coming; then she turned and began to move up the great\nthoroughfare, which was just beginning to wake to its multitudinous\nactivities.\n\nShe walked less rapidly now, studying each shop window as she passed,\nbut not with the desultory eye of enjoyment: the watchful fixity of her\ngaze overlooked everything but the object of its quest. At length she\nstopped before a small window wedged between two mammoth buildings,\nand displaying, behind its shining plate-glass festooned with muslin,\na varied assortment of sofa-cushions, tea-cloths, pen-wipers, painted\ncalendars and other specimens of feminine industry. In a corner of\nthe window she had read, on a slip of paper pasted against the pane:\n“Wanted, a Saleslady,” and after studying the display of fancy articles\nbeneath it, she gave her mantle a twitch, straightened her shoulders and\nwent in.\n\nBehind a counter crowded with pin-cushions, watch-holders and other\nneedlework trifles, a plump young woman with smooth hair sat sewing bows\nof ribbon on a scrap basket. The little shop was about the size of the\none on which Ann Eliza had just closed the door; and it looked as fresh\nand gay and thriving as she and Evelina had once dreamed of making\nBunner Sisters. The friendly air of the place made her pluck up courage\nto speak.\n\n“Saleslady? Yes, we do want one. Have you any one to recommend?” the\nyoung woman asked, not unkindly.\n\nAnn Eliza hesitated, disconcerted by the unexpected question; and the\nother, cocking her head on one side to study the effect of the bow she\nhad just sewed on the basket, continued: “We can't afford more than\nthirty dollars a month, but the work is light. She would be expected to\ndo a little fancy sewing between times. We want a bright girl: stylish,\nand pleasant manners. You know what I mean. Not over thirty, anyhow; and\nnice-looking. Will you write down the name?”\n\nAnn Eliza looked at her confusedly. She opened her lips to explain, and\nthen, without speaking, turned toward the crisply-curtained door.\n\n“Ain't you going to leave the AD-dress?” the young woman called out\nafter her. Ann Eliza went out into the thronged street. The great city,\nunder the fair spring sky, seemed to throb with the stir of innumerable\nbeginnings. She walked on, looking for another shop window with a sign\nin it.\n\n\nTHE END.",
