 "text": "FALK\n\nA REMINISCENCE\n\n\nBy Joseph Conrad\n\n\n\nSeveral of us, all more or less connected with the sea, were dining in\na small river-hostelry not more than thirty miles from London, and less\nthan twenty from that shallow and dangerous puddle to which our coasting\nmen give the grandiose name of “German Ocean.” And through the wide\nwindows we had a view of the Thames; an enfilading view down the Lower\nHope Reach. But the dinner was execrable, and all the feast was for the\neyes.\n\nThat flavour of salt-water which for so many of us had been the very\nwater of life permeated our talk. He who hath known the bitterness of\nthe Ocean shall have its taste forever in his mouth. But one or two\nof us, pampered by the life of the land, complained of hunger. It was\nimpossible to swallow any of that stuff. And indeed there was a strange\nmustiness in everything. The wooden dining-room stuck out over the mud\nof the shore like a lacustrine dwelling; the planks of the floor seemed\nrotten; a decrepit old waiter tottered pathetically to and fro before\nan antediluvian and worm-eaten sideboard; the chipped plates might have\nbeen disinterred from some kitchen midden near an inhabited lake; and\nthe chops recalled times more ancient still. They brought forcibly to\none’s mind the night of ages when the primeval man, evolving the first\nrudiments of cookery from his dim consciousness, scorched lumps of flesh\nat a fire of sticks in the company of other good fellows; then, gorged\nand happy, sat him back among the gnawed bones to tell his artless tales\nof experience--the tales of hunger and hunt--and of women, perhaps!\n\nBut luckily the wine happened to be as old as the waiter. So,\ncomparatively empty, but upon the whole fairly happy, we sat back and\ntold our artless tales. We talked of the sea and all its works. The\nsea never changes, and its works for all the talk of men are wrapped in\nmystery. But we agreed that the times were changed. And we talked of old\nships, of sea-accidents, of break-downs, dismastings; and of a man who\nbrought his ship safe to Liverpool all the way from the River Platte\nunder a jury rudder. We talked of wrecks, of short rations and of\nheroism--or at least of what the newspapers would have called heroism\nat sea--a manifestation of virtues quite different from the heroism of\nprimitive times. And now and then falling silent all together we gazed\nat the sights of the river.\n\nA P. & O. boat passed bound down. “One gets jolly good dinners on board\nthese ships,” remarked one of our band. A man with sharp eyes read\nout the name on her bows: Arcadia. “What a beautiful model of a ship!”\n murmured some of us. She was followed by a small cargo steamer, and the\nflag they hauled down aboard while we were looking showed her to be a\nNorwegian. She made an awful lot of smoke; and before it had quite blown\naway, a high-sided, short, wooden barque, in ballast and towed by a\npaddle-tug, appeared in front of the windows. All her hands were forward\nbusy setting up the headgear; and aft a woman in a red hood, quite alone\nwith the man at the wheel, paced the length of the poop back and forth,\nwith the grey wool of some knitting work in her hands.\n\n“German I should think,” muttered one. “The skipper has his wife on\nboard,” remarked another; and the light of the crimson sunset all\nablaze behind the London smoke, throwing a glow of Bengal light upon the\nbarque’s spars, faded away from the Hope Reach.\n\nThen one of us, who had not spoken before, a man of over fifty, that had\ncommanded ships for a quarter of a century, looking after the barque now\ngliding far away, all black on the lustre of the river, said:\n\nThis reminds me of an absurd episode in my life, now many years ago,\nwhen I got first the command of an iron barque, loading then in a\ncertain Eastern seaport. It was also the capital of an Eastern kingdom,\nlying up a river as might be London lies up this old Thames of ours.\nNo more need be said of the place; for this sort of thing might have\nhappened anywhere where there are ships, skippers, tugboats, and orphan\nnieces of indescribable splendour. And the absurdity of the episode\nconcerns only me, my enemy Falk, and my friend Hermann.\n\nThere seemed to be something like peculiar emphasis on the words “My\nfriend Hermann,” which caused one of us (for we had just been speaking\nof heroism at sea) to say idly and nonchalantly:\n\n“And was this Hermann a hero?”\n\nNot at all, said our grizzled friend. No hero at all. He was a\nSchiff-fuhrer: Ship-conductor. That’s how they call a Master Mariner\nin Germany. I prefer our way. The alliteration is good, and there is\nsomething in the nomenclature that gives to us as a body the sense\nof corporate existence: Apprentice, Mate, Master, in the ancient and\nhonourable craft of the sea. As to my friend Hermann, he might have\nbeen a consummate master of the honourable craft, but he was called\nofficially Schiff-fuhrer, and had the simple, heavy appearance of a\nwell-to-do farmer, combined with the good-natured shrewdness of a small\nshopkeeper. With his shaven chin, round limbs, and heavy eyelids he did\nnot look like a toiler, and even less like an adventurer of the sea.\nStill, he toiled upon the seas, in his own way, much as a shopkeeper\nworks behind his counter. And his ship was the means by which he\nmaintained his growing family.\n\nShe was a heavy, strong, blunt-bowed affair, awakening the ideas of\nprimitive solidity, like the wooden plough of our forefathers. And there\nwere, about her, other suggestions of a rustic and homely nature. The\nextraordinary timber projections which I have seen in no other vessel\nmade her square stern resemble the tail end of a miller’s waggon. But\nthe four stern ports of her cabin, glazed with six little greenish panes\neach, and framed in wooden sashes painted brown, might have been the\nwindows of a cottage in the country. The tiny white curtains and the\ngreenery of flower pots behind the glass completed the resemblance. On\none or two occasions when passing under stern I had detected from my\nboat a round arm in the act of tilting a watering pot, and the bowed\nsleek head of a maiden whom I shall always call Hermann’s niece, because\nas a matter of fact I’ve never heard her name, for all my intimacy with\nthe family.\n\nThis, however, sprang up later on. Meantime in common with the rest\nof the shipping in that Eastern port, I was left in no doubt as to\nHermann’s notions of hygienic clothing. Evidently he believed in\nwearing good stout flannel next his skin. On most days little frocks and\npinafores could be seen drying in the mizzen rigging of his ship, or\na tiny row of socks fluttering on the signal halyards; but once a\nfortnight the family washing was exhibited in force. It covered the\npoop entirely. The afternoon breeze would incite to a weird and flabby\nactivity all that crowded mass of clothing, with its vague suggestions\nof drowned, mutilated and flattened humanity. Trunks without heads waved\nat you arms without hands; legs without feet kicked fantastically with\ncollapsible flourishes; and there were long white garments that, taking\nthe wind fairly through their neck openings edged with lace, became for\na moment violently distended as by the passage of obese and invisible\nbodies. On these days you could make out that ship at a great distance\nby the multi-coloured grotesque riot going on abaft her mizzen mast.\n\nShe had her berth just ahead of me, and her name was Diana,--Diana not\nof Ephesus but of Bremen. This was proclaimed in white letters a foot\nlong spaced widely across the stern (somewhat like the lettering of a\nshop-sign) under the cottage windows. This ridiculously unsuitable name\nstruck one as an impertinence towards the memory of the most charming\nof goddesses; for, apart from the fact that the old craft was physically\nincapable of engaging in any sort of chase, there was a gang of four\nchildren belonging to her. They peeped over the rail at passing boats\nand occasionally dropped various objects into them. Thus, sometime\nbefore I knew Hermann to speak to, I received on my hat a horrid\nrag-doll belonging to Hermann’s eldest daughter. However, these\nyoungsters were upon the whole well behaved. They had fair heads, round\neyes, round little knobby noses, and they resembled their father a good\ndeal.\n\nThis Diana of Bremen was a most innocent old ship, and seemed to know\nnothing of the wicked sea, as there are on shore households that know\nnothing of the corrupt world. And the sentiments she suggested were\nunexceptionable and mainly of a domestic order. She was a home. All\nthese dear children had learned to walk on her roomy quarter-deck. In\nsuch thoughts there is something pretty, even touching. Their teeth, I\nshould judge, they had cut on the ends of her running gear. I have\nmany times observed the baby Hermann (Nicholas) engaged in gnawing the\nwhipping of the fore-royal brace. Nicholas’ favourite place of residence\nwas under the main fife-rail. Directly he was let loose he would\ncrawl off there, and the first seaman who came along would bring him,\ncarefully held aloft in tarry hands, back to the cabin door. I fancy\nthere must have been a standing order to that effect. In the course of\nthese transportations the baby, who was the only peppery person in the\nship, tried to smite these stalwart young German sailors on the face.\n\nMrs. Hermann, an engaging, stout housewife, wore on board baggy blue\ndresses with white dots. When, as happened once or twice I caught her at\nan elegant little wash-tub rubbing hard on white collars, baby’s socks,\nand Hermann’s summer neckties, she would blush in girlish confusion, and\nraising her wet hands greet me from afar with many friendly nods. Her\nsleeves would be rolled up to the elbows, and the gold hoop of her\nwedding ring glittered among the soapsuds. Her voice was pleasant, she\nhad a serene brow, smooth bands of very fair hair, and a good-humoured\nexpression of the eyes. She was motherly and moderately talkative. When\nthis simple matron smiled, youthful dimples broke out on her fresh broad\ncheeks. Hermann’s niece on the other hand, an orphan and very silent, I\nnever saw attempt a smile. This, however, was not gloom on her part but\nthe restraint of youthful gravity.\n\nThey had carried her about with them for the last three years, to help\nwith the children and be company for Mrs. Hermann, as Hermann mentioned\nonce to me. It had been very necessary while they were all little, he\nhad added in a vexed manner. It was her arm and her sleek head that\nI had glimpsed one morning, through the stern-windows of the cabin,\nhovering over the pots of fuchsias and mignonette; but the first time I\nbeheld her full length I surrendered to her proportions. They fix her\nin my mind, as great beauty, great intelligence, quickness of wit\nor kindness of heart might have made some her other woman equally\nmemorable.\n\nWith her it was form and size. It was her physical personality that had\nthis imposing charm. She might have been witty, intelligent, and kind to\nan exceptional degree. I don’t know, and this is not to the point. All\nI know is that she was built on a magnificent scale. Built is the only\nword. She was constructed, she was erected, as it were, with a regal\nlavishness. It staggered you to see this reckless expenditure of\nmaterial upon a chit of a girl. She was youthful and also perfectly\nmature, as though she had been some fortunate immortal. She was heavy\ntoo, perhaps, but that’s nothing. It only added to that notion of\npermanence. She was barely nineteen. But such shoulders! Such round\narms! Such a shadowing forth of mighty limbs when with three long\nstrides she pounced across the deck upon the overturned Nicholas--it’s\nperfectly indescribable! She seemed a good, quiet girl, vigilant as\nto Lena’s needs, Gustav’s tumbles, the state of Carl’s dear little\nnose--conscientious, hardworking, and all that. But what magnificent\nhair she had! Abundant, long, thick, of a tawny colour. It had the sheen\nof precious metals. She wore it plaited tightly into one single tress\nhanging girlishly down her back and its end reached down to her waist.\nThe massiveness of it surprised you. On my word it reminded one of a\nclub. Her face was big, comely, of an unruffled expression. She had a\ngood complexion, and her blue eyes were so pale that she appeared to\nlook at the world with the empty white candour of a statue. You could\nnot call her good-looking. It was something much more impressive.\nThe simplicity of her apparel, the opulence of her form, her imposing\nstature, and the extraordinary sense of vigorous life that seemed to\nemanate from her like a perfume exhaled by a flower, made her beautiful\nwith a beauty of a rustic and olympian order. To watch her reaching up\nto the clothes-line with both arms raised high above her head, caused\nyou to fall a musing in a strain of pagan piety. Excellent Mrs.\nHermann’s baggy cotton gowns had some sort of rudimentary frills at neck\nand bottom, but this girl’s print frocks hadn’t even a wrinkle; nothing\nbut a few straight folds in the skirt falling to her feet, and these,\nwhen she stood still, had a severe and statuesque quality. She was\ninclined naturally to be still whether sitting or standing. However, I\ndon’t mean to say she was statuesque. She was too generously alive; but\nshe could have stood for an allegoric statue of the Earth. I don’t mean\nthe worn-out earth of our possession, but a young Earth, a virginal\nplanet undisturbed by the vision of a future teeming with the monstrous\nforms of life and death, clamorous with the cruel battles of hunger and\nthought.\n\nThe worthy Hermann himself was not very entertaining, though his English\nwas fairly comprehensible. Mrs. Hermann, who always let off one speech\nat least at me in an hospitable, cordial tone (and in Platt-Deutsch I\nsuppose) I could not understand. As to their niece, however satisfactory\nto look upon (and she inspired you somehow with a hopeful view as to\nthe prospects of mankind) she was a modest and silent presence, mostly\nengaged in sewing, only now and then, as I observed, falling over that\nwork into a state of maidenly meditation. Her aunt sat opposite her,\nsewing also, with her feet propped on a wooden footstool. On the other\nside of the deck Hermann and I would get a couple of chairs out of the\ncabin and settle down to a smoking match, accompanied at long intervals\nby the pacific exchange of a few words. I came nearly every evening.\nHermann I would find in his shirt sleeves. As soon as he returned from\nthe shore on board his ship he commenced operations by taking off his\ncoat; then he put on his head an embroidered round cap with a tassel,\nand changed his boots for a pair of cloth slippers. Afterwards he smoked\nat the cabin-door, looking at his children with an air of civic virtue,\ntill they got caught one after another and put to bed in various\nstaterooms. Lastly, we would drink some beer in the cabin, which\nwas furnished with a wooden table on cross legs, and with black\nstraight-backed chairs--more like a farm kitchen than a ship’s cuddy.\nThe sea and all nautical affairs seemed very far removed from the\nhospitality of this exemplary family.\n\nAnd I liked this because I had a rather worrying time on board my own\nship. I had been appointed ex-officio by the British Consul to take\ncharge of her after a man who had died suddenly, leaving for the\nguidance of his successor some suspiciously unreceipted bills, a few\ndry-dock estimates hinting at bribery, and a quantity of vouchers for\nthree years’ extravagant expenditure; all these mixed up together in a\ndusty old violin-case lined with ruby velvet. I found besides a large\naccount-book, which, when opened, hopefully turned out to my infinite\nconsternation to be filled with verses--page after page of rhymed\ndoggerel of a jovial and improper character, written in the neatest\nminute hand I ever did see. In the same fiddle-case a photograph of my\npredecessor, taken lately in Saigon, represented in front of a garden\nview, and in company of a female in strange draperies, an elderly,\nsquat, rugged man of stern aspect in a clumsy suit of black broadcloth,\nand with the hair brushed forward above the temples in a manner\nreminding one of a boar’s tusks. Of a fiddle, however, the only trace\non board was the case, its empty husk as it were; but of the two last\nfreights the ship had indubitably earned of late, there were not even\nthe husks left. It was impossible to say where all that money had gone\nto. It wasn’t on board. It had not been remitted home; for a letter\nfrom the owners, preserved in a desk evidently by the merest accident,\ncomplained mildly enough that they had not been favoured by a scratch\nof the pen for the last eighteen months. There were next to no stores on\nboard, not an inch of spare rope or a yard of canvas. The ship had been\nrun bare, and I foresaw no end of difficulties before I could get her\nready for sea.\n\nAs I was young then--not thirty yet--I took myself and my troubles very\nseriously. The old mate, who had acted as chief mourner at the captain’s\nfuneral, was not particularly pleased at my coming. But the fact is the\nfellow was not legally qualified for command, and the Consul was bound,\nif at all possible, to put a properly certificated man on board. As to\nthe second mate, all I can say his name was Tottersen, or something like\nthat. His practice was to wear on his head, in that tropical climate, a\nmangy fur cap. He was, without exception, the stupidest man I had ever\nseen on board ship. And he looked it too. He looked so confoundedly\nstupid that it was a matter of surprise for me when he answered to his\nname.\n\nI drew no great comfort from their company, to say the least of it;\nwhile the prospect of making a long sea passage with those two fellows\nwas depressing. And my other thoughts in solitude could not be of a\ngay complexion. The crew was sickly, the cargo was coming very slow; I\nforesaw I would have lots of trouble with the charterers, and doubted\nwhether they would advance me enough money for the ship’s expenses.\nTheir attitude towards me was unfriendly. Altogether I was not getting\non. I would discover at odd times (generally about midnight) that I\nwas totally inexperienced, greatly ignorant of business, and hopelessly\nunfit for any sort of command; and when the steward had to be taken to\nthe hospital ill with choleraic symptoms I felt bereaved of the only\ndecent person at the after end of the ship. He was fully expected to\nrecover, but in the meantime had to be replaced by some sort of servant.\nAnd on the recommendation of a certain Schomberg, the proprietor of the\nsmaller of the two hotels in the place, I engaged a Chinaman. Schomberg,\na brawny, hairy Alsatian, and an awful gossip, assured me that it was\nall right. “First-class boy that. Came in the suite of his Excellency\nTseng the Commissioner--you know. His Excellency Tseng lodged with me\nhere for three weeks.”\n\nHe mouthed the Chinese Excellency at me with great unction, though\nthe specimen of the “suite” did not seem very promising. At the time,\nhowever, I did not know what an untrustworthy humbug Schomberg was. The\n“boy” might have been forty or a hundred and forty for all you could\ntell--one of those Chinamen of the death’s-head type of face and\ncompletely inscrutable. Before the end of the third day he had revealed\nhimself as a confirmed opium-smoker, a gambler, a most audacious thief,\nand a first-class sprinter. When he departed at the top of his speed\nwith thirty-two golden sovereigns of my own hard-earned savings it was\nthe last straw. I had reserved that money in case my difficulties came\nto the worst. Now it was gone I felt as poor and naked as a fakir. I\nclung to my ship, for all the bother she caused me, but what I could not\nbear were the long lonely evenings in her cuddy, where the atmosphere,\nmade smelly by a leaky lamp, was agitated by the snoring of the mate.\nThat fellow shut himself up in his stuffy cabin punctually at eight, and\nmade gross and revolting noises like a water-logged trump. It was odious\nnot to be able to worry oneself in comfort on board one’s own ship.\nEverything in this world, I reflected, even the command of a nice little\nbarque, may be made a delusion and a snare for the unwary spirit of\npride in man.\n\nFrom such reflections I was glad to make any escape on board that Bremen\nDiana. There apparently no whisper of the world’s iniquities had ever\npenetrated. And yet she lived upon the wide sea: and the sea tragic\nand comic, the sea with its horrors and its peculiar scandals, the sea\npeopled by men and ruled by iron necessity is indubitably a part of the\nworld. But that patriarchal old tub, like some saintly retreat, echoed\nnothing of it. She was world proof. Her venerable innocence apparently\nhad put a restraint on the roaring lusts of the sea. And yet I have\nknown the sea too long to believe in its respect for decency. An\nelemental force is ruthlessly frank. It may, of course, have been\nHermann’s skilful seamanship, but to me it looked as if the allied\noceans had refrained from smashing these high bulwarks, unshipping\nthe lumpy rudder, frightening the children, and generally opening this\nfamily’s eyes out of sheer reticence. It looked like reticence. The\nruthless disclosure was in the end left for a man to make; a man strong\nand elemental enough and driven to unveil some secrets of the sea by the\npower of a simple and elemental desire.\n\nThis, however, occurred much later, and meantime I took sanctuary in\nthat serene old ship early every evening. The only person on board that\nseemed to be in trouble was little Lena, and in due course I perceived\nthat the health of the rag-doll was more than delicate. This object led\na sort of “in extremis” existence in a wooden box placed against the\nstarboard mooring-bitts, tended and nursed with the greatest sympathy\nand care by all the children, who greatly enjoyed pulling long faces and\nmoving with hushed footsteps. Only the baby--Nicholas--looked on with a\ncold, ruffianly leer, as if he had belonged to another tribe altogether.\nLena perpetually sorrowed over the box, and all of them were in deadly\nearnest. It was wonderful the way these children would work up their\ncompassion for that bedraggled thing I wouldn’t have touched with a pair\nof tongs. I suppose they were exercising and developing their racial\nsentimentalism by the means of that dummy. I was only surprised that\nMrs. Hermann let Lena cherish and hug that bundle of rags to that\nextent, it was so disreputably and completely unclean. But Mrs. Hermann\nwould raise her fine womanly eyes from her needlework to look on with\namused sympathy, and did not seen to see it, somehow, that this\nobject of affection was a disgrace to the ship’s purity. Purity, not\ncleanliness, is the word. It was pushed so far that I seemed to detect\nin this too a sentimental excess, as if dirt had been removed in\nvery love. It is impossible to give you an idea of such a meticulous\nneatness. It was as if every morning that ship had been arduously\nexplored with--with toothbrushes. Her very bowsprit three times a week\nhad its toilette made with a cake of soap and a piece of soft flannel.\nArrayed--I _must_ say arrayed--arrayed artlessly in dazzling white paint\nas to wood and dark green as to ironwork the simple-minded distribution\nof these colours evoked the images of simple-minded peace, of arcadian\nfelicity; and the childish comedy of disease and sorrow struck me\nsometimes as an abominably real blot upon that ideal state.\n\nI enjoyed it greatly, and on my part I brought a little mild excitement\ninto it. Our intimacy arose from the pursuit of that thief. It was in\nthe evening, and Hermann, who, contrary to his habits, had stayed on\nshore late that day, was extricating himself backwards out of a little\ngharry on the river bank, opposite his ship, when the hunt passed.\nRealising the situation as though he had eyes in his shoulder-blades, he\njoined us with a leap and took the lead. The Chinaman fled silent like\na rapid shadow on the dust of an extremely oriental road. I followed. A\nlong way in the rear my mate whooped like a savage. A young moon threw\na bashful light on a plain like a monstrous waste ground: the\narchitectural mass of a Buddhist temple far away projected itself\nin dead black on the sky. We lost the thief of course; but in my\ndisappointment I had to admire Hermann’s presence of mind. The velocity\nthat stodgy man developed in the interests of a complete stranger earned\nmy warm gratitude--there was something truly cordial in his exertions.\n\nHe seemed as vexed as myself at our failure, and would hardly listen to\nmy thanks. He said it was “nothings,” and invited me on the spot to\ncome on board his ship and drink a glass of beer with him. We poked\nsceptically for a while amongst the bushes, peered without conviction\ninto a ditch or two. There was not a sound: patches of slime glimmered\nfeebly amongst the reeds. Slowly we trudged back, drooping under the\nthin sickle of the moon, and I heard him mutter to himself, “Himmel!\nZwei und dreissig Pfund!” He was impressed by the figure of my loss. For\na long time we had ceased to hear the mate’s whoops and yells.\n\nThen he said to me, “Everybody has his troubles,” and as we went on\nremarked that he would never have known anything of mine hadn’t he by an\nextraordinary chance been detained on shore by Captain Falk. He didn’t\nlike to stay late ashore--he added with a sigh. The something doleful in\nhis tone I put to his sympathy with my misfortune, of course.\n\nOn board the Diana Mrs. Hermann’s fine eyes expressed much interest and\ncommiseration. We had found the two women sewing face to face under the\nopen skylight in the strong glare of the lamp. Hermann walked in first,\nstarting in the very doorway to pull off his coat, and encouraging\nme with loud, hospitable ejaculations: “Come in! This way! Come in,\ncaptain!” At once, coat in hand, he began to tell his wife all about\nit. Mrs. Hermann put the palms of her plump hands together; I smiled\nand bowed with a heavy heart: the niece got up from her sewing to\nbring Hermann’s slippers and his embroidered calotte, which he assumed\npontifically, talking (about me) all the time. Billows of white stuff\nlay between the chairs on the cabin floor; I caught the words “Zwei und\ndreissig Pfund” repeated several times, and presently came the beer,\nwhich seemed delicious to my throat, parched with running and the\nemotions of the chase.\n\nI didn’t get away till well past midnight, long after the women had\nretired. Hermann had been trading in the East for three years or more,\ncarrying freights of rice and timber mostly. His ship was well known in\nall the ports from Vladivostok to Singapore. She was his own property.\nThe profits had been moderate, but the trade answered well enough while\nthe children were small yet. In another year or so he hoped he would\nbe able to sell the old Diana to a firm in Japan for a fair price. He\nintended to return home, to Bremen, by mail boat, second class, with\nMrs. Hermann and the children. He told me all this stolidly, with slow\npuffs at his pipe. I was sorry when knocking the ashes out he began\nto rub his eyes. I would have sat with him till morning. What had I to\nhurry on board my own ship for? To face the broken rifled drawer in my\nstate-room. Ugh! The very thought made me feel unwell.\n\nI became their daily guest, as you know. I think that Mrs. Hermann from\nthe first looked upon me as a romantic person. I did not, of course,\ntear my hair _coram populo_ over my loss, and she took it for lordly\nindifference. Afterwards, I daresay, I did tell them some of my\nadventures--such as they were--and they marvelled greatly at the extent\nof my experience. Hermann would translate what he thought the most\nstriking passages. Getting up on his legs, and as if delivering a\nlecture on a phenomenon, he addressed himself, with gestures, to the two\nwomen, who would let their sewing sink slowly on their laps. Meantime\nI sat before a glass of Hermann’s beer, trying to look modest. Mrs.\nHermann would glance at me quickly, emit slight “Ach’s!” The girl never\nmade a sound. Never. But she too would sometimes raise her pale eyes\nto look at me in her unseeing gentle way. Her glance was by no means\nstupid; it beamed out soft and diffuse as the moon beams upon a\nlandscape--quite differently from the scrutinising inspection of the\nstars. You were drowned in it, and imagined yourself to appear blurred.\nAnd yet this same glance when turned upon Christian Falk must have been\nas efficient as the searchlight of a battle-ship.\n\nFalk was the other assiduous visitor on board, but from his behaviour\nhe might have been coming to see the quarter-deck capstan. He certainly\nused to stare at it a good deal when keeping us company outside the\ncabin door, with one muscular arm thrown over the back of the chair, and\nhis big shapely legs, in very tight white trousers, extended far out and\nending in a pair of black shoes as roomy as punts. On arrival he would\nshake Hermann’s hand with a mutter, bow to the women, and take up his\ncareless and misanthropic attitude by our side. He departed abruptly,\nwith a jump, going through the performance of grunts, handshakes, bow,\nas if in a panic. Sometimes, with a sort of discreet and convulsive\neffort, he approached the women and exchanged a few low words with them,\nhalf a dozen at most. On these occasions Hermann’s usual stare became\npositively glassy and Mrs. Hermann’s kind countenance would colour up.\nThe girl herself never turned a hair.\n\nFalk was a Dane or perhaps a Norwegian, I can’t tell now. At all events\nhe was a Scandinavian of some sort, and a bloated monopolist to boot.\nIt is possible he was unacquainted with the word, but he had a clear\nperception of the thing itself. His tariff of charges for towing ships\nin and out was the most brutally inconsiderate document of the sort I\nhad ever seen. He was the commander and owner of the only tug-boat on\nthe river, a very trim white craft of 150 tons or more, as elegantly\nneat as a yacht, with a round wheel-house rising like a glazed turret\nhigh above her sharp bows, and with one slender varnished pole mast\nforward. I daresay there are yet a few shipmasters afloat who remember\nFalk and his tug very well. He extracted his pound and a half of\nflesh from each of us merchant-skippers with an inflexible sort of\nindifference which made him detested and even feared. Schomberg used to\nremark: “I won’t talk about the fellow. I don’t think he has six drinks\nfrom year’s end to year’s end in my place. But my advice is, gentlemen,\ndon’t you have anything to do with him, if you can help it.”\n\nThis advice, apart from unavoidable business relations, was easy to\nfollow because Falk intruded upon no one. It seems absurd to compare a\ntugboat skipper to a centaur: but he reminded me somehow of an engraving\nin a little book I had as a boy, which represented centaurs at a stream,\nand there was one, especially in the foreground, prancing bow and arrows\nin hand, with regular severe features and an immense curled wavy beard,\nflowing down his breast. Falk’s face reminded me of that centaur.\nBesides, he was a composite creature. Not a man-horse, it is true, but\na man-boat. He lived on board his tug, which was always dashing up and\ndown the river from early morn till dewy eve.\n\nIn the last rays of the setting sun, you could pick out far away down\nthe reach his beard borne high up on the white structure, foaming up\nstream to anchor for the night. There was the white-clad man’s body, and\nthe rich brown patch of the hair, and nothing below the waist but the\n‘thwart-ship white lines of the bridge-screens, that lead the eye to the\nsharp white lines of the bows cleaving the muddy water of the river.\n\nSeparated from his boat to me at least he seemed incomplete. The tug\nherself without his head and torso on the bridge looked mutilated as it\nwere. But he left her very seldom. All the time I remained in harbour\nI saw him only twice on shore. On the first occasion it was at my\ncharterers, where he came in misanthropically to get paid for towing out\na French barque the day before. The second time I could hardly believe\nmy eyes, for I beheld him reclining under his beard in a cane-bottomed\nchair in the billiard-room of Schomberg’s hotel.\n\nIt was very funny to see Schomberg ignoring him pointedly. The\nartificiality of it contrasted strongly with Falk’s natural unconcern.\nThe big Alsatian talked loudly with his other customers, going from one\nlittle table to the other, and passing Falk’s place of repose with his\neyes fixed straight ahead. Falk sat there with an untouched glass at his\nelbow. He must have known by sight and name every white man in the room,\nbut he never addressed a word to anybody. He acknowledged my presence by\na drop of his eyelids, and that was all. Sprawling there in the chair,\nhe would, now and again, draw the palms of both his hands down his face,\ngiving at the same time a slight, almost imperceptible, shudder.\n\nIt was a habit he had, and of course I was perfectly familiar with it,\nsince you could not remain an hour in his company without being made to\nwonder at such a movement breaking some long period of stillness. It was\na passionate and inexplicable gesture. He used to make it at all sorts\nof times; as likely as not after he had been listening to little Lena’s\nchatter about the suffering doll, for instance. The Hermann children\nalways besieged him about his legs closely, though, in a gentle way, he\nshrank from them a little. He seemed, however, to feel a great affection\nfor the whole family. For Hermann himself especially. He sought his\ncompany. In this case, for instance, he must have been waiting for him,\nbecause as soon as he appeared Falk rose hastily, and they went out\ntogether. Then Schomberg expounded in my hearing to three or four people\nhis theory that Falk was after Captain Hermann’s niece, and asserted\nconfidently that nothing would come of it. It was the same last year\nwhen Captain Hermann was loading here, he said.\n\nNaturally, I did not believe Schomberg, but I own that for a time I\nobserved closely what went on. All I discovered was some impatience on\nHermann’s part. At the sight of Falk, stepping over the gangway, the\nexcellent man would begin to mumble and chew between his teeth something\nthat sounded like German swear-words. However, as I’ve said, I’m not\nfamiliar with the language, and Hermann’s soft, round-eyed countenance\nremained unchanged. Staring stolidly ahead he greeted him with, “Wie\ngehts,” or in English, “How are you?” with a throaty enunciation. The\ngirl would look up for an instant and move her lips slightly: Mrs.\nHermann let her hands rest on her lap to talk volubly to him for a\nminute or so in her pleasant voice before she went on with her sewing\nagain. Falk would throw himself into a chair, stretch his big legs, as\nlike as not draw his hands down his face passionately. As to myself, he\nwas not pointedly impertinent: it was rather as though he could not be\nbothered with such trifles as my existence; and the truth is that being\na monopolist he was under no necessity to be amiable. He was sure to get\nhis own extortionate terms out of me for towage whether he frowned\nor smiled. As a matter of fact, he did neither: but before many days\nelapsed he managed to astonish me not a little and to set Schomberg’s\ntongue clacking more than ever.\n\nIt came about in this way. There was a shallow bar at the mouth of the\nriver which ought to have been kept down, but the authorities of the\nState were piously busy gilding afresh the great Buddhist Pagoda just\nthen, and I suppose had no money to spare for dredging operations. I\ndon’t know how it may be now, but at the time I speak of that sandbank\nwas a great nuisance to the shipping. One of its consequences was that\nvessels of a certain draught of water, like Hermann’s or mine, could not\ncomplete their loading in the river. After taking in as much as possible\nof their cargo, they had to go outside to fill up. The whole procedure\nwas an unmitigated bore. When you thought you had as much on board as\nyour ship could carry safely over the bar, you went and gave notice to\nyour agents. They, in their turn, notified Falk that so-and-so was ready\nto go out. Then Falk (ostensibly when it fitted in with his other work,\nbut, if the truth were known, simply when his arbitrary spirit moved\nhim), after ascertaining carefully in the office that there was enough\nmoney to meet his bill, would come along unsympathetically, glaring\nat you with his yellow eyes from the bridge, and would drag you out\ndishevelled as to rigging, lumbered as to the decks, with unfeeling\nhaste, as if to execution. And he would force you too to take the end of\nhis own wire hawser, for the use of which there was of course an extra\ncharge. To your shouted remonstrances against that extortion this\ntowering trunk with one hand on the engine-room telegraph only shook its\nbearded head above the splash, the racket, and the clouds of smoke\nin which the tug, backing and filling in the smother of churning\npaddle-wheels behaved like a ferocious and impatient creature. He had\nher manned by the cheekiest gang of lascars I ever did see, whom he\nallowed to bawl at you insolently, and, once fast, he plucked you out\nof your berth as if he did not care what he smashed. Eighteen miles down\nthe river you had to go behind him, and then three more along the\ncoast to where a group of uninhabited rocky islets enclosed a sheltered\nanchorage. There you would have to lie at single anchor with your naked\nspars showing to seaward over these barren fragments of land scattered\nupon a very intensely blue sea. There was nothing to look at besides but\na bare coast, the muddy edge of the brown plain with the sinuosities\nof the river you had left, traced in dull green, and the Great Pagoda\nuprising lonely and massive with shining curves and pinnacles like the\ngorgeous and stony efflorescence of tropical rocks. You had nothing to\ndo but to wait fretfully for the balance of your cargo, which was sent\nout of the river with the greatest irregularity. And it was open to\nyou to console yourself with the thought that, after all, this stage\nof bother meant that your departure from these shores was indeed\napproaching at last.\n\nWe both had to go through that stage, Hermann and I, and there was a\nsort of tacit emulation between the ships as to which should be ready\nfirst. We kept on neck and neck almost to the finish, when I won\nthe race by going personally to give notice in the forenoon; whereas\nHermann, who was very slow in making up his mind to go ashore, did not\nget to the agents’ office till late in the day. They told him there that\nmy ship was first on turn for next morning, and I believe he told them\nhe was in no hurry. It suited him better to go the day after.\n\nThat evening, on board the Diana, he sat with his plump knees well\napart, staring and puffing at the curved mouthpiece of his pipe.\nPresently he spoke with some impatience to his niece about putting the\nchildren to bed. Mrs. Hermann, who was talking to Falk, stopped short\nand looked at her husband uneasily, but the girl got up at once and\ndrove the children before her into the cabin. In a little while Mrs.\nHermann had to leave us to quell what, from the sounds inside, must have\nbeen a dangerous mutiny. At this Hermann grumbled to himself. For half\nan hour longer Falk left alone with us fidgeted on his chair, sighed\nlightly, then at last, after drawing his hands down his face, got up,\nand as if renouncing the hope of making himself understood (he hadn’t\nopened his mouth once) he said in English: “Well.... Good night,\nCaptain Hermann.” He stopped for a moment before my chair and looked\ndown fixedly; I may even say he glared: and he went so far as to make a\ndeep noise in his throat. There was in all this something so marked\nthat for the first time in our limited intercourse of nods and grunts he\nexcited in me something like interest. But next moment he disappointed\nme--for he strode away hastily without a nod even.\n\nHis manner was usually odd it is true, and I certainly did not pay much\nattention to it; but that sort of obscure intention, which seemed to\nlurk in his nonchalance like a wary old carp in a pond, had never before\ncome so near the surface. He had distinctly aroused my expectations. I\nwould have been unable to say what it was I expected, but at all events\nI did not expect the absurd developments he sprung upon me no later than\nthe break of the very next day.\n\nI remember only that there was, on that evening, enough point in his\nbehaviour to make me, after he had fled, wonder audibly what he might\nmean. To this Hermann, crossing his legs with a swing and settling\nhimself viciously away from me in his chair, said: “That fellow don’t\nknow himself what he means.”\n\nThere might have been some insight in such a remark. I said nothing,\nand, still averted, he added: “When I was here last year he was just the\nsame.” An eruption of tobacco smoke enveloped his head as if his temper\nhad exploded like gunpowder.\n\nI had half a mind to ask him point blank whether he, at least, didn’t\nknow why Falk, a notoriously unsociable man, had taken to visiting his\nship with such assiduity. After all, I reflected suddenly, it was a\nmost remarkable thing. I wonder now what Hermann would have said. As it\nturned out he didn’t let me ask. Forgetting all about Falk apparently,\nhe started a monologue on his plans for the future: the selling of the\nship, the going home; and falling into a reflective and calculating\nmood he mumbled between regular jets of smoke about the expense. The\nnecessity of disbursing passage money for all his tribe seemed to\ndisturb him in a manner that was the more striking because otherwise\nhe gave no signs of a miserly disposition. And yet he fussed over the\nprospect of that voyage home in a mail boat like a sedentary grocer\nwho has made up his mind to see the world. He was racially thrifty I\nsuppose, and for him there must have been a great novelty in finding\nhimself obliged to pay for travelling--for sea travelling which was the\nnormal state of life for the family--from the very cradle for most of\nthem. I could see he grudged prospectively every single shilling which\nmust be spent so absurdly. It was rather funny. He would become doleful\nover it, and then again, with a fretful sigh, he would suppose there\nwas nothing for it now but to take three second-class tickets--and there\nwere the four children to pay for besides. A lot of money that to spend\nat once. A big lot of money.\n\nI sat with him listening (not for the first time) to these\nheart-searchings till I grew thoroughly sleepy, and then I left him and\nturned in on board my ship. At daylight I was awakened by a yelping of\nshrill voices, accompanied by a great commotion in the water, and the\nshort, bullying blasts of a steam-whistle. Falk with his tug had come\nfor me.\n\nI began to dress. It was remarkable that the answering noise on board my\nship together with the patter of feet above my head ceased suddenly. But\nI heard more remote guttural cries which seemed to express surprise and\nannoyance. Then the voice of my mate reached me howling expostulations\nto somebody at a distance. Other voices joined, apparently indignant;\na chorus of something that sounded like abuse replied. Now and then the\nsteam-whistle screeched.\n\nAltogether that unnecessary uproar was distracting, but down there in my\ncabin I took it calmly. In another moment, I thought, I should be going\ndown that wretched river, and in another week at the most I should be\ntotally quit of the odious place and all the odious people in it.\n\nGreatly cheered by the idea, I seized the hair-brushes and looking at\nmyself in the glass began to use them. Suddenly a hush fell upon the\nnoise outside, and I heard (the ports of my cabin were thrown open)--I\nheard a deep calm voice, not on board my ship, however, hailing\nresolutely in English, but with a strong foreign twang, “Go ahead!”\n\nThere may be tides in the affairs of men which taken at the flood...\nand so on. Personally I am still on the look out for that important\nturn. I am, however, afraid that most of us are fated to flounder for\never in the dead water of a pool whose shores are arid indeed. But\nI know that there are often in men’s affairs unexpectedly--even\nirrationally--illuminating moments when an otherwise insignificant\nsound, perhaps only some perfectly commonplace gesture, suffices\nto reveal to us all the unreason, all the fatuous unreason, of our\ncomplacency. “Go ahead” are not particularly striking words even when\npronounced with a foreign accent; yet they petrified me in the very\nact of smiling at myself in the glass. And then, refusing to believe my\nears, but already boiling with indignation, I ran out of the cabin and\nup on deck.\n\nIt was incredibly true. It was perfectly true. I had no eyes for\nanything but the Diana. It was she, then, was being taken away. She was\nalready out of her berth and shooting athwart the river. “The way this\nloonatic plucked that ship out is a caution,” said the awed voice of my\nmate close to my ear. “Hey! Hallo! Falk! Hermann! What’s this infernal\ntrick?” I yelled in a fury.\n\nNobody heard me. Falk certainly could not hear me. His tug was turning\nat full speed away under the other bank. The wire hawser between her and\nthe Diana, stretched as taut as a harp-string, vibrated alarmingly.\n\nThe high black craft careened over to the awful strain. A loud crack\ncame out of her, followed by the tearing and splintering of wood.\n“There!” said the awed voice in my ear. “He’s carried away their towing\nchock.” And then, with enthusiasm, “Oh! Look! Look! sir, Look! at them\nDutchmen skipping out of the way on the forecastle. I hope to goodness\nhe’ll break a few of their shins before he’s done with ‘em.”\n\nI yelled my vain protests. The rays of the rising sun coursing level\nalong the plain warmed my back, but I was hot enough with rage. I\ncould not have believed that a simple towing operation could suggest so\nplainly the idea of abduction, of rape. Falk was simply running off with\nthe Diana.\n\nThe white tug careered out into the middle of the river. The red floats\nof her paddle-wheels revolving with mad rapidity tore up the whole reach\ninto foam. The Diana in mid-stream waltzed round with as much grace\nas an old barn, and flew after her ravisher. Through the ragged fog of\nsmoke driving headlong upon the water I had a glimpse of Falk’s square\nmotionless shoulders under a white hat as big as a cart-wheel, of his\nred face, his yellow staring eyes, his great beard. Instead of keeping\na lookout ahead, he was deliberately turning his back on the river to\nglare at his tow. The tall heavy craft, never so used before in her\nlife, seemed to have lost her senses; she took a wild sheer against her\nhelm, and for a moment came straight at us, menacing and clumsy, like\na runaway mountain. She piled up a streaming, hissing, boiling wave\nhalf-way up her blunt stem, my crew let out one great howl,--and then we\nheld our breaths. It was a near thing. But Falk had her! He had her in\nhis clutch. I fancied I could hear the steel hawser ping as it surged\nacross the Diana’s forecastle, with the hands on board of her bolting\naway from it in all directions. It was a near thing. Hermann, with his\nhair rumpled, in a snuffy flannel shirt and a pair of mustard-coloured\ntrousers, had rushed to help with the wheel. I saw his terrified round\nface; I saw his very teeth uncovered by a sort of ghastly fixed grin;\nand in a great leaping tumult of water between the two ships the Diana\nwhisked past so close that I could have flung a hair-brush at his head,\nfor, it seems, I had kept them in my hands all the time. Meanwhile\nMrs. Hermann sat placidly on the skylight, with a woollen shawl on\nher shoulders. The excellent woman in response to my indignant\ngesticulations fluttered a handkerchief, nodding and smiling in the\nkindest way imaginable. The boys, only half-dressed, were jumping about\nthe poop in great glee, displaying their gaudy braces; and Lena in a\nshort scarlet petticoat, with peaked elbows and thin bare arms, nursed\nthe rag-doll with devotion. The whole family passed before my sight as\nif dragged across a scene of unparalleled violence. The last I saw was\nHermann’s niece with the baby Hermann in her arms standing apart from\nthe others. Magnificent in her close-fitting print frock she displayed\nsomething so commanding in the manifest perfection of her figure that\nthe sun seemed to be rising for her alone. The flood of light brought\nout the opulence of her form and the vigour of her youth in a glorifying\nway. She went by perfectly motionless and as if lost in meditation; only\nthe hem of her skirt stirred in the draught; the sun rays broke on her\nsleek tawny hair; that bald-headed ruffian, Nicholas, was whacking her\non the shoulder. I saw his tiny fat arm rise and fall in a workmanlike\nmanner. And then the four cottage windows of the Diana came into view\nretreating swiftly down the river. The sashes were up, and one of the\nwhite calico curtains was fluttered straight out like a streamer above\nthe agitated water of the wake.\n\nTo be thus tricked out of one’s turn was an unheard of occurrence. In\nmy agent’s office, where I went to complain at once, they protested with\napologies they couldn’t understand how the mistake arose: but Schomberg\nwhen I dropped in later to get some tiffin, though surprised to see me,\nwas perfectly ready with an explanation. I found him seated at the end\nof a long narrow table, facing his wife--a scraggy little woman, with\nlong ringlets and a blue tooth, who smiled abroad stupidly and looked\nfrightened when you spoke to her. Between them a waggling punkah fanned\ntwenty cane-bottomed chairs and two rows of shiny plates. Three\nChinamen in white jackets loafed with napkins in their hands around that\ndesolation. Schomberg’s pet table d’hote was not much of a success that\nday. He was feeding himself ferociously and seemed to overflow with\nbitterness.\n\nHe began by ordering in a brutal voice the chops to be brought back for\nme, and turning in his chair: “Mistake they told you? Not a bit of it!\nDon’t you believe it for a moment, captain! Falk isn’t a man to make\nmistakes unless on purpose.” His firm conviction was that Falk had been\ntrying all along to curry favour on the cheap with Hermann. “On the\ncheap--mind you! It doesn’t cost him a cent to put that insult upon you,\nand Captain Hermann gets in a day ahead of your ship. Time’s money! Eh?\nYou are very friendly with Captain Hermann I believe, but a man is bound\nto be pleased at any little advantage he may get. Captain Hermann is a\ngood business man, and there’s no such thing as a friend in business. Is\nthere?” He leaned forward and began to cast stealthy glances as usual.\n“But Falk is, and always was, a miserable fellow. I would despise him.”\n\nI muttered, grumpily, that I had no particular respect for Falk.\n\n“I would despise him,” he insisted, with an appearance of anxiety which\nwould have amused me if I had not been fathoms deep in discontent. To a\nyoung man fairly conscientious and as well-meaning as only the young\nman can be, the current ill-usage of life comes with a peculiar cruelty.\nYouth that is fresh enough to believe in guilt, in innocence, and in\nitself, will always doubt whether it have not perchance deserved its\nfate. Sombre of mind and without appetite, I struggled with the\nchop while Mrs. Schomberg sat with her everlasting stupid grin and\nSchomberg’s talk gathered way like a slide of rubbish.\n\n“Let me tell you. It’s all about that girl. I don’t know what Captain\nHermann expects, but if he asked me I could tell him something about\nFalk. He’s a miserable fellow. That man is a perfect slave. That’s what\nI call him. A slave. Last year I started this table d’hote, and sent\ncards out--you know. You think he had one meal in the house? Give the\nthing a trial? Not once. He has got hold now of a Madras cook--a blamed\nfraud that I hunted out of my cookhouse with a rattan. He was not fit to\ncook for white men. No, not for the white men’s dogs either; but, see,\nany damned native that can boil a pot of rice is good enough for Mr.\nFalk. Rice and a little fish he buys for a few cents from the fishing\nboats outside is what he lives on. You would hardly credit it--eh? A\nwhite man, too....”\n\nHe wiped his lips, using the napkin with indignation, and looking at me.\nIt flashed through my mind in the midst of my depression that if all the\nmeat in the town was like these table d’hote chops, Falk wasn’t so far\nwrong. I was on the point of saying this, but Schomberg’s stare was\nintimidating. “He’s a vegetarian, perhaps,” I murmured instead.\n\n“He’s a miser. A miserable miser,” affirmed the hotel-keeper with great\nforce. “The meat here is not so good as at home--of course. And dear\ntoo. But look at me. I only charge a dollar for the tiffin, and one\ndollar and fifty cents for the dinner. Show me anything cheaper. Why am\nI doing it? There’s little profit in this game. Falk wouldn’t look\nat it. I do it for the sake of a lot of young white fellows here that\nhadn’t a place where they could get a decent meal and eat it decently in\ngood company. There’s first-rate company always at my table.”\n\nThe convinced way he surveyed the empty chairs made me feel as if I had\nintruded upon a tiffin of ghostly Presences.\n\n“A white man should eat like a white man, dash it all,” he burst out\nimpetuously. “Ought to eat meat, must eat meat. I manage to get meat for\nmy patrons all the year round. Don’t I? I am not catering for a dam’ lot\nof coolies: Have another chop captain.... No? You, boy--take away!”\n\nHe threw himself back and waited grimly for the curry. The half-closed\njalousies darkened the room pervaded by the smell of fresh whitewash:\na swarm of flies buzzed and settled in turns, and poor Mrs. Schomberg’s\nsmile seemed to express the quintessence of all the imbecility that had\never spoken, had ever breathed, had ever been fed on infamous buffalo\nmeat within these bare walls. Schomberg did not open his lips till he\nwas ready to thrust therein a spoonful of greasy rice. He rolled his\neyes ridiculously before he swallowed the hot stuff, and only then broke\nout afresh.\n\n“It is the most degrading thing. They take the dish up to the wheelhouse\nfor him with a cover on it, and he shuts both the doors before he begins\nto eat. Fact! Must be ashamed of himself. Ask the engineer. He can’t\ndo without an engineer--don’t you see--and as no respectable man can be\nexpected to put up with such a table, he allows them fifteen dollars\na month extra mess money. I assure you it is so! You just ask Mr.\nFerdinand da Costa. That’s the engineer he has now. You may have seen\nhim about my place, a delicate dark young man, with very fine eyes and a\nlittle moustache. He arrived here a year ago from Calcutta. Between you\nand me, I guess the money-lenders there must have been after him. He\nrushes here for a meal every chance he can get, for just please tell me\nwhat satisfaction is that for a well-educated young fellow to feed all\nalone in his cabin--like a wild beast? That’s what Falk expects his\nengineers to put up with for fifteen dollars extra. And the rows on\nboard every time a little smell of cooking gets about the deck! You\nwouldn’t believe! The other day da Costa got the cook to fry a steak for\nhim--a turtle steak it was too, not beef at all--and the fat caught\nor something. Young da Costa himself was telling me of it here in this\nroom. ‘Mr. Schomberg’--says he-’if I had let a cylinder cover blow off\nthrough the skylight by my negligence Captain Falk couldn’t have been\nmore savage. He frightened the cook so that he won’t put anything on the\nfire for me now.’ Poor da Costa had tears in his eyes. Only try to put\nyourself in his place, captain: a sensitive, gentlemanly young fellow.\nIs he expected to eat his food raw? But that’s your Falk all over. Ask\nany one you like. I suppose the fifteen dollars extra he has to give\nkeep on rankling--in there.”\n\nAnd Schomberg tapped his manly breast. I sat half stunned by his\nirrelevant babble. Suddenly he gripped my forearm in an impressive and\ncautious manner, as if to lead me into a very cavern of confidence.\n\n“It’s nothing but enviousness,” he said in a lowered tone, which had a\nstimulating effect upon my wearied hearing. “I don’t suppose there\nis one person in this town that he isn’t envious of. I tell you he’s\ndangerous. Even I myself am not safe from him. I know for certain he\ntried to poison....”\n\n“Oh, come now,” I cried, revolted.\n\n“But I know for certain. The people themselves came and told me of it.\nHe went about saying everywhere I was a worse pest to this town than the\ncholera. He had been talking against me ever since I opened this hotel.\nAnd he poisoned Captain Hermann’s mind too. Last time the Diana was\nloading here Captain Hermann used to come in every day for a drink or a\ncigar. This time he hasn’t been here twice in a week. How do you account\nfor that?”\n\nHe squeezed my arm till he extorted from me some sort of mumble.\n\n“He makes ten times the money I do. I’ve another hotel to fight against,\nand there is no other tug on the river. I am not in his way, am I? He\nwouldn’t be fit to run an hotel if he tried. But that’s just his nature.\nHe can’t bear to think I am making a living. I only hope it makes him\nproperly wretched. He’s like that in everything. He would like to keep a\ndecent table well enough. But no--for the sake of a few cents. Can’t do\nit. It’s too much for him. That’s what I call being a slave to it. But\nhe’s mean enough to kick up a row when his nose gets tickled a bit. See\nthat? That just paints him. Miserly and envious. You can’t account for\nit any other way. Can you? I have been studying him these three years.”\n\nHe was anxious I should assent to his theory. And indeed on thinking it\nover it would have been plausible enough if there hadn’t been always the\nessential falseness of irresponsibility in Schomberg’s chatter. However,\nI was not disposed to investigate the psychology of Falk. I was engaged\njust then in eating despondently a piece of stale Dutch cheese, being\ntoo much crushed to care what I swallowed myself, let along bothering my\nhead about Falk’s ideas of gastronomy. I could expect from their study\nno clue to his conduct in matters of business, which seemed to me\ntotally unrestrained by morality or even by the commonest sort of\ndecency. How insignificant and contemptible I must appear, for the\nfellow to dare treat me like this--I reflected suddenly, writhing in\nsilent agony. And I consigned Falk and all his peculiarities to the\ndevil with so much mental fervour as to forget Schomberg’s existence,\ntill he grabbed my arm urgently. “Well, you may think and think till\nevery hair of your head falls off, captain; but you can’t explain it in\nany other way.”\n\nFor the sake of peace and quietness I admitted hurriedly that I\ncouldn’t: persuaded that now he would leave off. But the only result was\nto make his moist face shine with the pride of cunning. He removed his\nhand for a moment to scare a black mass of flies off the sugar-basin and\ncaught hold of my arm again.\n\n“To be sure. And in the same way everybody is aware he would like to get\nmarried. Only he can’t. Let me quote you an instance. Well, two years\nago a Miss Vanlo, a very ladylike girl, came from home to keep house for\nher brother, Fred, who had an engineering shop for small repairs by\nthe water side. Suddenly Falk takes to going up to their bungalow after\ndinner, and sitting for hours in the verandah saying nothing. The poor\ngirl couldn’t tell for the life of her what to do with such a man, so\nshe would keep on playing the piano and singing to him evening after\nevening till she was ready to drop. And it wasn’t as if she had been\na strong young woman either. She was thirty, and the climate had been\nplaying the deuce with her. Then--don’t you know--Fred had to sit up with\nthem for propriety, and during whole weeks on end never got a single\nchance to get to bed before midnight. That was not pleasant for a tired\nman--was it? And besides Fred had worries then because his shop didn’t\npay and he was dropping money fast. He just longed to get away from here\nand try his luck somewhere else, but for the sake of his sister he hung\non and on till he ran himself into debt over his ears--I can tell you.\nI, myself, could show a handful of his chits for meals and drinks in\nmy drawer. I could never find out tho’ where he found all the money at\nlast. Can’t be but he must have got something out of that brother of\nhis, a coal merchant in Port Said. Anyhow he paid everybody before he\nleft, but the girl nearly broke her heart. Disappointment, of course,\nand at her age, don’t you know.... Mrs. Schomberg here was very\nfriendly with her, and she could tell you. Awful despair. Fainting\nfits. It was a scandal. A notorious scandal. To that extent that old Mr.\nSiegers--not your present charterer, but Mr. Siegers the father, the old\ngentleman who retired from business on a fortune and got buried at sea\ngoing home, _he_ had to interview Falk in his private office. He was a man\nwho could speak like a Dutch Uncle, and, besides, Messrs. Siegers had\nbeen helping Falk with a good bit of money from the start. In fact you\nmay say they made him as far as that goes. It so happened that just at\nthe time he turned up here, their firm was chartering a lot of sailing\nships every year, and it suited their business that there should be good\ntowing facilities on the river. See?... Well--there’s always an\near at the keyhole--isn’t there? In fact,” he lowered his tone\nconfidentially, “in this case a good friend of mine; a man you can see\nhere any evening; only they conversed rather low. Anyhow my friend’s\ncertain that Falk was trying to make all sorts of excuses, and old\nMr. Siegers was coughing a lot. And yet Falk wanted all the time to be\nmarried too. Why! It’s notorious the man has been longing for years to\nmake a home for himself. Only he can’t face the expense. When it comes\nto putting his hand in his pocket--it chokes him off. That’s the truth\nand no other. I’ve always said so, and everybody agrees with me by this\ntime. What do you think of that--eh?”\n\nHe appealed confidently to my indignation, but having a mind to annoy\nhim I remarked, “that it seemed to me very pitiful--if true.”\n\nHe bounced in his chair as if I had run a pin into him. I don’t know\nwhat he might have said, only at that moment we heard through the half\nopen door of the billiard-room the footsteps of two men entering from\nthe verandah, a murmur of two voices; at the sharp tapping of a coin on\na table Mrs. Schomberg half rose irresolutely. “Sit still,” he hissed at\nher, and then, in an hospitable, jovial tone, contrasting amazingly with\nthe angry glance that had made his wife sink in her chair, he cried very\nloud: “Tiffin still going on in here, gentlemen.”\n\nThere was no answer, but the voices dropped suddenly. The head Chinaman\nwent out. We heard the clink of ice in the glasses, pouring sounds, the\nshuffling of feet, the scraping of chairs. Schomberg, after wondering in\na low mutter who the devil could be there at this time of the day, got\nup napkin in hand to peep through the doorway cautiously. He retreated\nrapidly on tip-toe, and whispering behind his hand informed me that\nit was Falk, Falk himself who was in there, and, what’s more, he had\nCaptain Hermann with him.\n\nThe return of the tug from the outer Roads was unexpected but possible,\nfor Falk had taken away the Diana at half-past five, and it was now two\no’clock. Schomberg wished me to observe that neither of these men would\nspend a dollar on a tiffin, which they must have wanted. But by the time\nI was ready to leave the dining-room Falk had gone. I heard the last of\nhis big boots on the planks of the verandah. Hermann was sitting quite\nalone in the large, wooden room with the two lifeless billiard tables\nshrouded in striped covers, mopping his face diligently. He wore\nhis best go-ashore clothes, a stiff collar, black coat, large white\nwaistcoat, grey trousers. A white cotton sunshade with a cane handle\nreposed between his legs, his side whiskers were neatly brushed, his\nchin had been freshly shaved; and he only distantly resembled the\ndishevelled and terrified man in a snuffy night shirt and ignoble old\ntrousers I had seen in the morning hanging on to the wheel of the Diana.\n\nHe gave a start at my entrance, and addressed me at once in some\nconfusion, but with genuine eagerness. He was anxious to make it clear\nhe had nothing to do with what he called the “tam pizness” of the\nmorning. It was most inconvenient. He had reckoned upon another day up\nin town to settle his bills and sign certain papers. There were also\nsome few stores to come, and sundry pieces of “my ironwork,” as he\ncalled it quaintly, landed for repairs, had been left behind. Now he\nwould have to hire a native boat to take all this out to the ship. It\nwould cost five or six dollars perhaps. He had had no warning from\nFalk. Nothing.... He hit the table with his dumpy fist.... Der\nverfluchte Kerl came in the morning like a “tam’ ropper,” making a great\nnoise, and took him away. His mate was not prepared, his ship was moored\nfast--he protested it was shameful to come upon a man in that way.\nShameful! Yet such was the power Falk had on the river that when I\nsuggested in a chilling tone that he might have simply refused to have\nhis ship moved, Hermann was quite startled at the idea. I never realised\nso well before that this is an age of steam. The exclusive possession\nof a marine boiler had given Falk the whip-hand of us all. Hermann,\nrecovering, put it to me appealingly that I knew very well how unsafe it\nwas to contradict that fellow. At this I only smiled distantly.\n\n“Der Kerl!” he cried. He was sorry he had not refused. He was indeed.\nThe damage! The damage! What for all that damage! There was no occasion\nfor damage. Did I know how much damage he had done? It gave me a certain\nsatisfaction to tell him that I had heard his old waggon of a ship crack\nfore and aft as she went by. “You passed close enough to me,” I added\nsignificantly.\n\nHe threw both his hands up to heaven at the recollection. One of them\ngrasped by the middle the white parasol, and he resembled curiously\na caricature of a shop-keeping citizen in one of his own German comic\npapers. “Ach! That was dangerous,” he cried. I was amused. But directly\nhe added with an appearance of simplicity, “The side of your iron ship\nwould have been crushed in like--like this matchbox.”\n\n“Would it?” I growled, much less amused now; but by the time I had\ndecided that this remark was not meant for a dig at me he had\nworked himself into a high state of resentfulness against Falk. The\ninconvenience, the damage, the expense! Gottferdam! Devil take the\nfellow. Behind the bar Schomberg with a cigar in his teeth, pretended\nto be writing with a pencil on a large sheet of paper; and as Hermann’s\nexcitement increased it made me comfortingly aware of my own calmness\nand superiority. But it occurred to me while I listened to his\nrevilings, that after all the good man had come up in the tug. There\nperhaps--since he must come to town--he had no option. But evidently he\nhad had a drink with Falk, either accepted or offered. How was that? So\nI checked him by saying loftily that I hoped he would make Falk pay for\nevery penny of the damage.\n\n“That’s it! That’s it! Go for him,” called out Schomberg from the bar,\nflinging his pencil down and rubbing his hands.\n\nWe ignored his noise. But Hermann’s excitement suddenly went off\nthe boil as when you remove a saucepan from the fire. I urged on his\nconsideration that he had done now with Falk and Falk’s confounded tug.\nHe, Hermann, would not, perhaps, turn up again in this part of the world\nfor years to come, since he was going to sell the Diana at the end\nof this very trip (“Go home passenger in a mail boat,” he murmured\nmechanically). He was therefore safe from Falk’s malice. All he had to\ndo was to race off to his consignees and stop payment of the towage bill\nbefore Falk had the time to get in and lift the money.\n\nNothing could have been less in the spirit of my advice than the\nthoughtful way in which he set about to make his parasol stay propped\nagainst the edge of the table.\n\nWhile I watched his concentrated efforts with astonishment he threw at\nme one or two perplexed, half-shy glances. Then he sat down. “That’s all\nvery well,” he said reflectively.\n\nIt cannot be doubted that the man had been thrown off his balance by\nbeing hauled out of the harbour against his wish. His stolidity had been\nprofoundly stirred, else he would never have made up his mind to ask me\nunexpectedly whether I had not remarked that Falk had been casting eyes\nupon his niece. “No more than myself,” I answered with literal truth.\nThe girl was of the sort one necessarily casts eyes at in a sense. She\nmade no noise, but she filled most satisfactorily a good bit of space.\n\n“But you, captain, are not the same kind of man,” observed Hermann.\n\nI was not, I am happy to say, in a position to deny this. “What about\nthe lady?” I could not help asking. At this he gazed for a time into\nmy face, earnestly, and made as if to change the subject. I heard him\nbeginning to mutter something unexpected, about his children growing\nold enough to require schooling. He would have to leave them ashore with\ntheir grandmother when he took up that new command he expected to get in\nGermany.\n\nThis constant harping on his domestic arrangements was funny. I suppose\nit must have been like the prospect of a complete alteration in his\nlife. An epoch. He was going, too, to part with the Diana! He had served\nin her for years. He had inherited her. From an uncle, if I remember\nrightly. And the future loomed big before him, occupying his thought\nexclusively with all its aspects as on the eve of a venturesome\nenterprise. He sat there frowning and biting his lip, and suddenly he\nbegan to fume and fret.\n\nI discovered to my momentary amusement that he seemed to imagine I\ncould, should or ought, have caused Falk in some way to pronounce\nhimself. Such a hope was incomprehensible, but funny. Then the contact\nwith all this foolishness irritated me. I said crossly that I had seen\nno symptoms, but if there were any--since he, Hermann, was so sure--then\nit was still worse. What pleasure Falk found in humbugging people in\njust that way I couldn’t say. It was, however, my solemn duty to warn\nhim. It had lately, I said, come to my knowledge that there was a man\n(not a very long time ago either) who had been taken in just like this.\n\nAll this passed in undertones, and at this point Schomberg, exasperated\nat our secrecy, went out of the room slamming the door with a crash\nthat positively lifted us in our chairs. This, or else what I had said,\nhuffed my Hermann, He supposed, with a contemptuous toss of his head\ntowards the door which trembled yet, that I had got hold of some of\nthat man’s silly tales. It looked, indeed, as though his mind had been\nthoroughly poisoned against Schomberg. “His tales were--they were,” he\nrepeated, seeking for the word--“trash.” They were trash, he reiterated,\nand moreover I was young yet...\n\nThis horrid aspersion (I regret I am no longer exposed to that sort of\ninsult) made me huffy too. I felt ready in my own mind to back up every\nassertion of Schomberg’s and on any subject. In a moment, devil only\nknows why, Hermann and I were looking at each other most inimically.\nHe caught up his hat without more ado and I gave myself the pleasure of\ncalling after him:\n\n“Take my advice and make Falk pay for breaking up your ship. You aren’t\nlikely to get anything else out of him.”\n\nWhen I got on board my ship later on, the old mate, who was very full of\nthe events of the morning, remarked:\n\n“I saw the tug coming back from the outer Roads just before two P.M.”\n (He never by any chance used the words morning or afternoon. Always P.M.\nor A.M., log-book style.) “Smart work that. Man’s always in a state of\nhurry. He’s a regular chucker-out, ain’t he, sir? There’s a few pubs I\nknow of in the East-end of London that would be all the better for\none of his sort around the bar.” He chuckled at his joke. “A regular\nchucker-out. Now he has fired out that Dutchman head over heels, I\nsuppose our turn’s coming to-morrow morning.”\n\nWe were all on deck at break of day (even the sick--poor devils--had\ncrawled out) ready to cast off in the twinkling of an eye. Nothing\ncame. Falk did not come. At last, when I began to think that probably\nsomething had gone wrong in his engine-room, we perceived the tug going\nby, full pelt, down the river, as if we hadn’t existed. For a moment I\nentertained the wild notion that he was going to turn round in the next\nreach. Afterwards I watched his smoke appear above the plain, now here,\nnow there, according to the windings of the river. It disappeared. Then\nwithout a word I went down to breakfast. I just simply went down to\nbreakfast.\n\nNot one of us uttered a sound till the mate, after imbibing--by means\nof suction out of a saucer--his second cup of tea, exclaimed: “Where the\ndevil is the man gone to?”\n\n“Courting!” I shouted, with such a fiendish laugh that the old chap\ndidn’t venture to open his lips any more.\n\nI started to the office perfectly calm. Calm with excessive rage.\nEvidently they knew all about it already, and they treated me to a\nshow of consternation. The manager, a soft-footed, immensely obese man,\nbreathing short, got up to meet me, while all round the room the young\nclerks, bending over the papers on their desks, cast upward glances in\nmy direction. The fat man, without waiting for my complaint, wheezing\nheavily and in a tone as if he himself were incredulous, conveyed to\nme the news that Falk--Captain Falk--had declined--had absolutely\ndeclined--to tow my ship--to have anything to do with my ship--this day\nor any other day. Never!\n\nI did my best to preserve a cool appearance, but, all the same, I must\nhave shown how much taken aback I was. We were talking in the middle\nof the room. Suddenly behind my back some ass blew his nose with great\nforce, and at the same time another quill-driver jumped up and went out\non the landing hastily. It occurred to me I was cutting a foolish figure\nthere. I demanded angrily to see the principal in his private room.\n\nThe skin of Mr. Siegers’ head showed dead white between the iron grey\nstreaks of hair lying plastered cross-wise from ear to ear over the top\nof his skull in the manner of a bandage. His narrow sunken face was of\nan uniform and permanent terra-cotta colour, like a piece of pottery.\nHe was sickly, thin, and short, with wrists like a boy of ten. But from\nthat debile body there issued a bullying voice, tremendously loud, harsh\nand resonant, as if produced by some powerful mechanical contrivance\nin the nature of a fog-horn. I do not know what he did with it in\nthe private life of his home, but in the larger sphere of business it\npresented the advantage of overcoming arguments without the slightest\nmental effort, by the mere volume of sound. We had had several\npassages of arms. It took me all I knew to guard the interests of my\nowners--whom, nota bene, I had never seen--while Siegers (who had\nmade their acquaintance some years before, during a business tour in\nAustralia) pretended to the knowledge of their innermost minds, and, in\nthe character of “our very good friends,” threw them perpetually at my\nhead.\n\nHe looked at me with a jaundiced eye (there was no love lost between\nus), and declared at once that it was strange, very strange. His\npronunciation of English was so extravagant that I can’t even attempt to\nreproduce it. For instance, he said “Fferie strantch.” Combined with\nthe bellowing intonation it made the language of one’s childhood sound\nweirdly startling, and even if considered purely as a kind of unmeaning\nnoise it filled you with astonishment at first. “They had,” he\ncontinued, “been acquainted with Captain Falk for very many years, and\nnever had any reason....”\n\n“That’s why I come to you, of course,” I interrupted. “I’ve the right\nto know the meaning of this infernal nonsense.” In the half light of the\nroom, which was greenish, because of the tree-tops screening the\nwindow, I saw him writhe his meagre shoulders. It came into my head, as\ndisconnected ideas will come at all sorts of times into one’s head, that\nthis, most likely, was the very room where, if the tale were true, Falk\nhad been lectured by Mr. Siegers, the father. Mr. Siegers’ (the son’s)\noverwhelming voice, in brassy blasts, as though he had been trying to\narticulate his words through a trombone, was expressing his great regret\nat a conduct characterised by a very marked want of discretion... As I\nlived I was being lectured too! His deafening gibberish was difficult to\nfollow, but it was _my_ conduct--mine!--that... Damn! I wasn’t going to\nstand this.\n\n“What on earth are you driving at?” I asked in a passion. I put my hat\non my head (he never offered a seat to anybody), and as he seemed for\nthe moment struck dumb by my irreverence, I turned my back on him and\nmarched out. His vocal arrangements blared after me a few threats of\ncoming down on the ship for the demurrage of the lighters, and all the\nother expenses consequent upon the delays arising from my frivolity.\n\nOnce outside in the sunshine my head swam. It was no longer a question\nof mere delay. I perceived myself involved in hopeless and humiliating\nabsurdities that were leading me to something very like a disaster. “Let\nus be calm,” I muttered to myself, and ran into the shade of a\nleprous wall. From that short side-street I could see the broad main\nthoroughfare ruinous and gay, running away, away between stretches of\ndecaying masonry, bamboo fences, ranges of arcades of brick and plaster,\nhovels of lath and mud, lofty temple gates of carved timber, huts of\nrotten mats--an immensely wide thoroughfare, loosely packed as far as\nthe eye could reach with a barefooted and brown multitude paddling ankle\ndeep in the dust. For a moment I felt myself about to go out of my mind\nwith worry and desperation.\n\nSome allowance must be made for the feelings of a young man new to\nresponsibility. I thought of my crew. Half of them were ill, and I\nreally began to think that some of them would end by dying on board if\nI couldn’t get them out to sea soon. Obviously I should have to take my\nship down the river, either working under canvas or dredging with the\nanchor down; operations which, in common with many modern sailors,\nI only knew theoretically. And I almost shrank from undertaking them\nshorthanded and without local knowledge of the river bed, which is so\nnecessary for the confident handling of the ship. There were no pilots,\nno beacons, no buoys of any sort; but there was a very devil of a\ncurrent for anybody to see, no end of shoal places, and at least two\nobviously awkward turns of the channel between me and the sea. But how\ndangerous these turns were I would not tell. I didn’t even know what\nmy ship was capable of! I had never handled her in my life. A\nmisunderstanding between a man and his ship in a difficult river with no\nroom to make it up, is bound to end in trouble for the man. On the other\nhand, it must be owned I had not much reason to count upon a general run\nof good luck. And suppose I had the misfortune to pile her up high and\ndry on some beastly shoal? That would have been the final undoing of\nthat voyage. It was plain that if Falk refused to tow me out he would\nalso refuse to pull me off. This meant--what? A day lost at the\nvery best; but more likely a whole fortnight of frizzling on some\npestilential mud-flat, of desperate work, of discharging cargo; more than\nlikely it meant borrowing money at an exorbitant rate of interest--from\nthe Siegers’ gang too at that. They were a power in the port. And that\nelderly seaman of mine, Gambril, had looked pretty ghastly when I\nwent forward to dose him with quinine that morning. _He_ would certainly\ndie--not to speak of two or three others that seemed nearly as bad,\nand of the rest of them just ready to catch any tropical disease going.\nHorror, ruin and everlasting remorse. And no help. None. I had fallen\namongst a lot of unfriendly lunatics!\n\nAt any rate, if I must take my ship down myself it was my duty to\nprocure if possible some local knowledge. But that was not easy. The\nonly person I could think of for that service was a certain Johnson,\nformerly captain of a country ship, but now spliced to a country wife\nand gone utterly to the bad. I had only heard of him in the vaguest way,\nas living concealed in the thick of two hundred thousand natives, and\nonly emerging into the light of day for the purpose of hunting up some\nbrandy. I had a notion that if I could lay my hands on him I would sober\nhim on board my ship and use him for a pilot. Better than nothing. Once\na sailor always a sailor--and he had known the river for years. But in\nour Consulate (where I arrived dripping after a sharp walk) they could\ntell me nothing. The excellent young men on the staff, though willing to\nhelp me, belonged to a sphere of the white colony for which that sort of\nJohnson does not exist. Their suggestion was that I should hunt the\nman up myself with the help of the Consulate’s constable--an\nex-sergeant-major of a regiment of Hussars.\n\nThis man, whose usual duty apparently consisted in sitting behind a\nlittle table in an outer room of Consular offices, when ordered to\nassist me in my search for Johnson displayed lots of energy and a\nmarvellous amount of local knowledge of a sort. But he did not conceal\nan immense and sceptical contempt for the whole business. We explored\ntogether on that afternoon an infinity of infamous grog shops, gambling\ndens, opium dens. We walked up narrow lanes where our gharry--a tiny\nbox of a thing on wheels, attached to a jibbing Burmah pony--could by\nno means have passed. The constable seemed to be on terms of scornful\nintimacy with Maltese, with Eurasians, with Chinamen, with Klings, and\nwith the sweepers attached to a temple, with whom he talked at the gate.\nWe interviewed also through a grating in a mud wall closing a blind\nalley an immensely corpulent Italian, who, the ex-sergeant-major\nremarked to me perfunctorily, had “killed another man last year.”\n Thereupon he addressed him as “Antonio” and “Old Buck,” though that\nbloated carcase, apparently more than half filling the sort of cell\nwherein it sat, recalled rather a fat pig in a stye. Familiar and never\nunbending, the sergeant chucked--absolutely chucked--under the chin\na horribly wrinkled and shrivelled old hag propped on a stick, who had\nvolunteered some sort of information: and with the same stolid face he\nkept up an animated conversation with the groups of swathed brown women,\nwho sat smoking cheroots on the door-steps of a long range of clay\nhovels. We got out of the gharry and clambered into dwellings airy like\npacking crates, or descended into places sinister like cellars. We got\nin, we drove on, we got out again for the sole purpose, as it seemed, of\nlooking behind a heap of rubble. The sun declined; my companion was curt\nand sardonic in his answers, but it appears we were just missing Johnson\nall along. At last our conveyance stopped once more with a jerk, and the\ndriver jumping down opened the door.\n\nA black mudhole blocked the lane. A mound of garbage crowned with the\ndead body of a dog arrested us not. An empty Australian beef tin bounded\ncheerily before the toe of my boot. Suddenly we clambered through a gap\nin a prickly fence....\n\nIt was a very clean native compound: and the big native woman, with bare\nbrown legs as thick as bedposts, pursuing on all fours a silver dollar\nthat came rolling out from somewhere, was Mrs. Johnson herself. “Your\nman’s at home,” said the ex-sergeant, and stepped aside in complete\nand marked indifference to anything that might follow. Johnson--at\nhome--stood with his back to a native house built on posts and with its\nwalls made of mats. In his left hand he held a banana. Out of the right\nhe dealt another dollar into space. The woman captured this one on the\nwing, and there and then plumped down on the ground to look at us with\ngreater comfort.\n\nMy man was sallow of face, grizzled, unshaven, muddy on elbows and\nback; where the seams of his serge coat yawned you could see his white\nnakedness. The vestiges of a paper collar encircled his neck. He looked\nat us with a grave, swaying surprise. “Where do you come from?” he\nasked. My heart sank. How could I have been stupid enough to waste\nenergy and time for this?\n\nBut having already gone so far I approached a little nearer and declared\nthe purpose of my visit. He would have to come at once with me, sleep on\nboard my ship, and to-morrow, with the first of the ebb, he would give\nme his assistance in getting my ship down to the sea, without steam. A\nsix-hundred-ton barque, drawing nine feet aft. I proposed to give\nhim eighteen dollars for his local knowledge; and all the time I was\nspeaking he kept on considering attentively the various aspects of the\nbanana, holding first one side up to his eye, then the other.\n\n“You’ve forgotten to apologise,” he said at last with extreme precision.\n“Not being a gentleman yourself, you don’t know apparently when you\nintrude upon a gentleman. I am one. I wish you to understand that when I\nam in funds I don’t work, and now...”\n\nI would have pronounced him perfectly sober hadn’t he paused in great\nconcern to try and brush a hole off the knee of his trousers.\n\n“I have money--and friends. Every gentleman has. Perhaps you would like\nto know my friend? His name is Falk. You could borrow some money. Try to\nremember. F-A-L-K, Falk.” Abruptly his tone changed. “A noble heart,” he\nsaid muzzily.\n\n“Has Falk been giving you some money?” I asked, appalled by the detailed\nfinish of the dark plot.\n\n“Lent me, my good man, not given me. Lent,” he corrected suavely.\n“Met me taking the air last evening, and being as usual anxious to\noblige--Hadn’t you better go to the devil out of my compound?”\n\nAnd upon this, without other warning, he let fly with the banana which\nmissed my head, and took the constable just under the left eye. He\nrushed at the miserable Johnson, stammering with fury. They fell....\nBut why dwell on the wretchedness, the breathlessness, the degradation,\nthe senselessness, the weariness, the ridicule and humiliation\nand--and--the perspiration, of these moments? I dragged the ex-hussar\noff. He was like a wild beast. It seems he had been greatly annoyed\nat losing his free afternoon on my account. The garden of his bungalow\nrequired his personal attention, and at the slight blow of the banana\nthe brute in him had broken loose. We left Johnson on his back, still\nblack in the face, but beginning to kick feebly. Meantime, the big woman\nhad remained sitting on the ground, apparently paralysed with extreme\nterror.\n\nFor half an hour we jolted inside our rolling box, side by side, in\nprofound silence. The ex-sergeant was busy staunching the blood of a\nlong scratch on his cheek. “I hope you’re satisfied,” he said suddenly.\n“That’s what comes of all that tomfool business. If you hadn’t\nquarrelled with that tugboat skipper over some girl or other, all this\nwouldn’t have happened.”\n\n“You heard _that_ story?” I said.\n\n“Of course I heard. And I shouldn’t wonder if the Consul-General himself\ndoesn’t come to hear of it. How am I to go before him to-morrow with\nthat thing on my cheek--I want to know. Its _you_ who ought to have got\nthis!”\n\nAfter that, till the gharry stopped and he jumped out without\nleave-taking, he swore to himself steadily, horribly; muttering great,\npurposeful, trooper oaths, to which the worst a sailor can do is like\nthe prattle of a child. For my part I had just the strength to crawl\ninto Schomberg’s coffee-room, where I wrote at a little table a note to\nthe mate instructing him to get everything ready for dropping down the\nriver next day. I couldn’t face my ship. Well! she had a clever sort of\nskipper and no mistake--poor thing! What a horrid mess! I took my head\nbetween my hands. At times the obviousness of my innocence would reduce\nme to despair. What had I done? If I had done something to bring about\nthe situation I should at least have learned not to do it again. But I\nfelt guiltless to the point of imbecility. The room was empty yet;\nonly Schomberg prowled round me goggle-eyed and with a sort of awed\nrespectful curiosity. No doubt he had set the story going himself; but\nhe was a good-hearted chap, and I am really persuaded he participated in\nall my troubles. He did what he could for me. He ranged aside the heavy\nmatch-stand, set a chair straight, pushed a spittoon slightly with\nhis foot--as you show small attentions to a friend under a great\nsorrow--sighed, and at last, unable to hold his tongue:\n\n“Well! I warned you, captain. That’s what comes of running your head\nagainst Mr. Falk. Man’ll stick at nothing.”\n\nI sat without stirring, and after surveying me with a sort of\ncommiseration in his eyes he burst out in a hoarse whisper: “But for\na fine lump of a girl, she’s a fine lump of a girl.” He made a loud\nsmacking noise with his thick lips. “The finest lump of a girl that I\never...” he was going on with great unction, but for some reason or\nother broke off. I fancied myself throwing something at his head. “I\ndon’t blame you, captain. Hang me if I do,” he said with a patronising\nair.\n\n“Thank you,” I said resignedly. It was no use fighting against this\nfalse fate. I don’t know even if I was sure myself where the truth of\nthe matter began. The conviction that it would end disastrously had been\ndriven into me by all the successive shocks my sense of security had\nreceived. I began to ascribe an extraordinary potency to agents in\nthemselves powerless. It was as if Schomberg’s baseless gossip had the\npower to bring about the thing itself or the abstract enmity of Falk\ncould put my ship ashore.\n\nI have already explained how fatal this last would have been. For my\nfurther action, my youth, my inexperience, my very real concern for the\nhealth of my crew must be my excuse. The action itself, when it came,\nwas purely impulsive. It was set in movement quite undiplomatically and\nsimply by Falk’s appearance in the doorway.\n\nThe room was full by then and buzzing with voices. I had been looked\nat with curiosity by every one, but how am I to describe the sensation\nproduced by the appearance of Falk himself blocking the doorway? The\ntension of expectation could be measured by the profundity of the\nsilence that fell upon the very click of the billiard balls. As to\nSchomberg, he looked extremely frightened; he hated mortally any sort\nof row (fracas he called it) in his establishment. Fracas was bad\nfor business, he affirmed; but, in truth, this specimen of portly,\nmiddle-aged manhood was of a timid disposition. I don’t know what,\nconsidering my presence in the place, they all hoped would come of it. A\nsort of stag fight, perhaps. Or they may have supposed Falk had come in\nonly to annihilate me completely. As a matter of fact, Falk had come in\nbecause Hermann had asked him to inquire after the precious white cotton\nparasol which, in the worry and excitement of the previous day, he had\nforgotten at the table where we had held our little discussion.\n\nIt was this that gave me my opportunity. I don’t think I would have gone\nto seek Falk out. No. I don’t think so. There are limits. But there was\nan opportunity and I seized it--I have already tried to explain why. Now\nI will merely state that, in my opinion, to get his sickly crew into\nthe sea air and secure a quick despatch for his ship a skipper would be\njustified in going to any length, short of absolute crime. He should\nput his pride in his pocket; he may accept confidences; explain his\ninnocence as if it were a sin; he may take advantage of misconceptions,\nof desires and of weaknesses; he ought to conceal his horror and other\nemotions, and, if the fate of a human being, and that human being\na magnificent young girl, is strangely involved--why, he should\ncontemplate that fate (whatever it might seem to be) without turning a\nhair. And all these things I have done; the explaining, the listening,\nthe pretending--even to the discretion--and nobody, not even Hermann’s\nniece, I believe, need throw stones at me now. Schomberg at all events\nneedn’t, since from first to last, I am happy to say, there was not the\nslightest “fracas.”\n\nOvercoming a nervous contraction of the windpipe, I had managed to\nexclaim “Captain Falk!” His start of surprise was perfectly genuine, but\nafterwards he neither smiled nor scowled. He simply waited. Then, when\nI had said, “I must have a talk with you,” and had pointed to a chair\nat my table, he moved up to me, though he didn’t sit down. Schomberg,\nhowever, with a long tumbler in his hand, was making towards us\nprudently, and I discovered then the only sign of weakness in Falk. He\nhad for Schomberg a repulsion resembling that sort of physical fear\nsome people experience at the sight of a toad. Perhaps to a man so\nessentially and silently concentrated upon himself (though he could talk\nwell enough, as I was to find out presently) the other’s irrepressible\nloquacity, embracing every human being within range of the tongue, might\nhave appeared unnatural, disgusting, and monstrous. He suddenly gave\nsigns of restiveness--positively like a horse about to rear, and,\nmuttering hurriedly as if in great pain, “No. I can’t stand that\nfellow,” seemed ready to bolt. This weakness of his gave me the\nadvantage at the very start. “Verandah,” I suggested, as if rendering\nhim a service, and walked him out by the arm. We stumbled over a few\nchairs; we had the feeling of open space before us, and felt the fresh\nbreath of the river--fresh, but tainted. The Chinese theatres across the\nwater made, in the sparsely twinkling masses of gloom an Eastern town\npresents at night, blazing centres of light, and of a distant and\nhowling uproar. I felt him become suddenly tractable again like an\nanimal, like a good-tempered horse when the object that scares him is\nremoved. Yes. I felt in the darkness there how tractable he was, without\nmy conviction of his inflexibility--tenacity, rather, perhaps--being in\nthe least weakened. His very arm abandoning itself to my grasp was as\nhard as marble--like a limb of iron. But I heard a tumultuous scuffling\nof boot-soles within. The unspeakable idiots inside were crowding to the\nwindows, climbing over each other’s backs behind the blinds, billiard\ncues and all. Somebody broke a window pane, and with the sound of\nfalling glass, so suggestive of riot and devastation, Schomberg reeled\nout after us in a state of funk which had prevented his parting with his\nbrandy and soda. He must have trembled like an aspen leaf. The piece of\nice in the long tumbler he held in his hand tinkled with an effect\nof chattering teeth. “I beg you, gentlemen,” he expostulated thickly.\n“Come! Really, now, I must insist...”\n\nHow proud I am of my presence of mind! “Hallo,” I said instantly in a\nloud and naive tone, “somebody’s breaking your windows, Schomberg. Would\nyou please tell one of your boys to bring out here a pack of cards and a\ncouple of lights? And two long drinks. Will you?”\n\nTo receive an order soothed him at once. It was business. “Certainly,”\n he said in an immensely relieved tone. The night was rainy, with\nwandering gusts of wind, and while we waited for the candles Falk said,\nas if to justify his panic, “I don’t interfere in anybody’s business.\nI don’t give any occasion for talk. I am a respectable man. But this\nfellow is always making out something wrong, and can never rest till he\ngets somebody to believe him.”\n\nThis was the first of my knowledge of Falk. This desire of\nrespectability, of being like everybody else, was the only recognition\nhe vouchsafed to the organisation of mankind. For the rest he might have\nbeen the member of a herd, not of a society. Self-preservation was his\nonly concern. Not selfishness, but mere self-preservation. Selfishness\npresupposes consciousness, choice, the presence of other men; but his\ninstinct acted as though he were the last of mankind nursing that law\nlike the only spark of a sacred fire. I don’t mean to say that living\nnaked in a cavern would have satisfied him. Obviously he was\nthe creature of the conditions to which he was born. No doubt\nself-preservation meant also the preservation of these conditions. But\nessentially it meant something much more simple, natural, and powerful.\nHow shall I express it? It meant the preservation of the five senses\nof his body--let us say--taking it in its narrowest as well as in its\nwidest meaning. I think you will admit before long the justice of this\njudgment. However, as we stood there together in the dark verandah I had\njudged nothing as yet--and I had no desire to judge--which is an idle\npractice anyhow. The light was long in coming.\n\n“Of course,” I said in a tone of mutual understanding, “it isn’t exactly\na game of cards I want with you.”\n\nI saw him draw his hands down his face--the vague stir of the passionate\nand meaningless gesture; but he waited in silent patience. It was\nonly when the lights had been brought out that he opened his lips. I\nunderstood his mumble to mean that “he didn’t know any game.”\n\n“Like this Schomberg and all the other fools will have to keep off,”\n I said tearing open the pack. “Have you heard that we are universally\nsupposed to be quarrelling about a girl? You know who--of course. I am\nreally ashamed to ask, but is it possible that you do me the honour to\nthink me dangerous?”\n\nAs I said these words I felt how absurd it was and also I felt\nflattered--for, really, what else could it be? His answer, spoken in\nhis usual dispassionate undertone, made it clear that it was so, but\nnot precisely as flattering as I supposed. He thought me dangerous with\nHermann, more than with the girl herself; but, as to quarrelling, I\nsaw at once how inappropriate the word was. We had no quarrel. Natural\nforces are not quarrelsome. You can’t quarrel with the wind that\ninconveniences and humiliates you by blowing off your hat in a street\nfull of people. He had no quarrel with me. Neither would a boulder,\nfalling on my head, have had. He fell upon me in accordance with the law\nby which he was moved--not of gravitation, like a detached stone, but\nof self-preservation. Of course this is giving it a rather wide\ninterpretation. Strictly speaking, he had existed and could have existed\nwithout being married. Yet he told me that he had found it more and\nmore difficult to live alone. Yes. He told me this in his low, careless\nvoice, to such a pitch of confidence had we arrived at the end of half\nan hour.\n\nIt took me just about that time to convince him that I had never\ndreamed of marrying Hermann’s niece. Could any necessity have been more\nextravagant? And the difficulty was the greater because he was so hard\nhit that he couldn’t imagine anybody being able to remain in a state of\nindifference. Any man with eyes in his head, he seemed to think, could\nnot help coveting so much bodily magnificence. This profound belief was\nconveyed by the manner he listened sitting sideways to the table and\nplaying absently with a few cards I had dealt to him at random. And the\nmore I saw into him the more I saw of him. The wind swayed the lights\nso that his sunburnt face, whiskered to the eyes, seemed to successively\nflicker crimson at me and to go out. I saw the extraordinary breadth\nof the high cheek-bones, the perpendicular style of the features,\nthe massive forehead, steep like a cliff, denuded at the top, largely\nuncovered at the temples. The fact is I had never before seen him\nwithout his hat; but now, as if my fervour had made him hot, he had\ntaken it off and laid it gently on the floor. Something peculiar in\nthe shape and setting of his yellow eyes gave them the provoking\nsilent intensity which characterised his glance. But the face was thin,\nfurrowed, worn; I discovered that through the bush of his hair, as\nyou may detect the gnarled shape of a tree trunk lost in a dense\nundergrowth. These overgrown cheeks were sunken. It was an anchorite’s\nbony head fitted with a Capuchin’s beard and adjusted to a herculean\nbody. I don’t mean athletic. Hercules, I take it, was not an athlete. He\nwas a strong man, susceptible to female charms, and not afraid of dirt.\nAnd thus with Falk, who was a strong man. He was extremely strong, just\nas the girl (since I must think of them together) was magnificently\nattractive by the masterful power of flesh and blood, expressed in\nshape, in size, in attitude--that is by a straight appeal to the senses.\nHis mind meantime, preoccupied with respectability, quailed before\nSchomberg’s tongue and seemed absolutely impervious to my protestations;\nand I went so far as to protest that I would just as soon think of\nmarrying my mother’s (dear old lady!) faithful female cook as Hermann’s\nniece. Sooner, I protested, in my desperation, much sooner; but it did\nnot appear that he saw anything outrageous in the proposition, and in\nhis sceptical immobility he seemed to nurse the argument that at all\nevents the cook was very, very far away. It must be said that, just\nbefore, I had gone wrong by appealing to the evidence of my manner\nwhenever I called on board the Diana. I had never attempted to approach\nthe girl, or to speak to her, or even to look at her in any marked way.\nNothing could be clearer. But, as his own idea of--let us say--courting,\nseemed to consist precisely in sitting silently for hours in the\nvicinity of the beloved object, that line of argument inspired him with\ndistrust. Staring down his extended legs he let out a grunt--as much as\nto say, “That’s all very fine, but you can’t throw dust in _my_ eyes.”\n\nAt last I was exasperated into saying, “Why don’t you put the matter at\nrest by talking to Hermann?” and I added sneeringly: “You don’t expect\nme perhaps to speak for you?”\n\nTo this he said, very loud for him, “Would you?”\n\nAnd for the first time he lifted his head to look at me with wonder\nand incredulity. He lifted his head so sharply that there could be\nno mistake. I had touched a spring. I saw the whole extent of my\nopportunity, and could hardly believe in it.\n\n“Why. Speak to... Well, of course,” I proceeded very slowly, watching\nhim with great attention, for, on my word, I feared a joke. “Not,\nperhaps, to the young lady herself. I can’t speak German, you know.\nBut...”\n\nHe interrupted me with the earnest assurance that Hermann had the\nhighest opinion of me; and at once I felt the need for the greatest\npossible diplomacy at this juncture. So I demurred just enough to draw\nhim on. Falk sat up, but except for a very noticeable enlargement of the\npupils, till the irises of his eyes were reduced to two narrow yellow\nrings, his face, I should judge, was incapable of expressing excitement.\n“Oh, yes! Hermann did have the greatest...”\n\n“Take up your cards. Here’s Schomberg peeping at us through the blind!”\n I said.\n\nWe went through the motions of what might have been a game of e’carte’.\nPresently the intolerable scandalmonger withdrew, probably to inform the\npeople in the billiard-room that we two were gambling on the verandah\nlike mad.\n\nWe were not gambling, but it was a game; a game in which I felt I held\nthe winning cards. The stake, roughly speaking, was the success of the\nvoyage--for me; and he, I apprehended, had nothing to lose. Our intimacy\nmatured rapidly, and before many words had been exchanged I perceived\nthat the excellent Hermann had been making use of me. That simple and\nastute Teuton had been, it seems, holding me up to Falk in the light of\na rival. I was young enough to be shocked at so much duplicity. “Did he\ntell you that in so many words?” I asked with indignation.\n\nHermann had not. He had given hints only; and of course it had not taken\nvery much to alarm Falk; but, instead of declaring himself, he had taken\nsteps to remove the family from under my influence. He was perfectly\nstraightforward about it--as straightforward as a tile falling on your\nhead. There was no duplicity in that man; and when I congratulated\nhim on the perfection of his arrangements--even to the bribing of the\nwretched Johnson against me--he had a genuine movement of protest. Never\nbribed. He knew the man wouldn’t work as long as he had a few cents in\nhis pocket to get drunk on, and, naturally (he said-”_naturally_”) he\nlet him have a dollar or two. He was himself a sailor, he said, and\nanticipated the view another sailor, like myself, was bound to take.\nOn the other hand, he was sure that I should have to come to grief. He\nhadn’t been knocking about for the last seven years up and down that\nriver for nothing. It would have been no disgrace to me--but he asserted\nconfidently I would have had my ship very awkwardly ashore at a spot two\nmiles below the Great Pagoda....\n\nAnd with all that he had no ill-will. That was evident. This was a\ncrisis in which his only object had been to gain time--I fancy. And\npresently he mentioned that he had written for some jewellery, real good\njewellery--had written to Hong-Kong for it. It would arrive in a day or\ntwo.\n\n“Well, then,” I said cheerily, “everything is all right. All you’ve got\nto do is to present it to the lady together with your heart, and live\nhappy ever after.”\n\nUpon the whole he seemed to accept that view as far as the girl was\nconcerned, but his eyelids drooped. There was still something in the\nway. For one thing Hermann disliked him so much. As to me, on the\ncontrary, it seemed as though he could not praise me enough. Mrs.\nHermann too. He didn’t know why they disliked him so. It made everything\nmost difficult.\n\nI listened impassive, feeling more and more diplomatic. His speech was\nnot transparently clear. He was one of those men who seem to live, feel,\nsuffer in a sort of mental twilight. But as to being fascinated by the\ngirl and possessed by the desire of home life with her--it was as clear\nas daylight. So much being at stake, he was afraid of putting it to\nthe hazard of declaration. Besides, there was something else. And with\nHermann being so set against him...\n\n“I see,” I said thoughtfully, while my heart beat fast with the\nexcitement of my diplomacy. “I don’t mind sounding Hermann. In fact, to\nshow you how mistaken you were, I am ready to do all I can for you in\nthat way.”\n\nA light sigh escaped him. He drew his hands down his face, and it\nemerged, bony, unchanged of expression, as if all the tissues had\nbeen ossified. All the passion was in those big brown hands. He was\nsatisfied. Then there was that other matter. If there were anybody on\nearth it was I who could persuade Hermann to take a reasonable view! I\nhad a knowledge of the world and lots of experience. Hermann admitted\nthis himself. And then I was a sailor too. Falk thought that a sailor\nwould be able to understand certain things best....\n\nHe talked as if the Hermanns had been living all their life in a rural\nhamlet, and I alone had been capable, with my practice in life, of\na large and indulgent view of certain occurrences. That was what my\ndiplomacy was leading me to. I began suddenly to dislike it.\n\n“I say, Falk,” I asked quite brusquely, “you haven’t already a wife put\naway somewhere?”\n\nThe pain and disgust of his denial were very striking. Couldn’t I\nunderstand that he was as respectable as any white man hereabouts;\nearning his living honestly. He was suffering from my suspicion, and the\nlow undertone of his voice made his protestations sound very pathetic.\nFor a moment he shamed me, but, my diplomacy notwithstanding, I seemed\nto develop a conscience, as if in very truth it were in my power to\ndecide the success of this matrimonial enterprise. By pretending hard\nenough we come to believe anything--anything to our advantage. And I had\nbeen pretending very hard, because I meant yet to be towed safely down\nthe river. But through conscience or stupidity, I couldn’t help alluding\nto the Vanlo affair. “You acted rather badly there. Didn’t you?” was\nwhat I ventured actually to say--for the logic of our conduct is always\nat the mercy of obscure and unforeseen impulses.\n\nHis dilated pupils swerved from my face, glancing at the window with\na sort of scared fury. We heard behind the blinds the continuous\nand sudden clicking of ivory, a jovial murmur of many voices, and\nSchomberg’s deep manly laugh.\n\n“That confounded old woman of a hotel-keeper then would never, never let\nit rest!” Falk exclaimed. “Well, yes! It had happened two years ago.”\n When it came to the point he owned he couldn’t make up his mind to trust\nFred Vanlo--no sailor, a bit of a fool too. He could not trust him,\nbut, to stop his row, he had lent him enough money to pay all his debts\nbefore he left. I was greatly surprised to hear this. Then Falk could\nnot be such a miser after all. So much the better for the girl. For a\ntime he sat silent; then he picked up a card, and while looking at it he\nsaid:\n\n“You need not think of anything bad. It was an accident. I’ve been\nunfortunate once.”\n\n“Then in heaven’s name say nothing about it.”\n\nAs soon as these words were out of my mouth I fancied I had said\nsomething immoral. He shook his head negatively. It had to be told.\nHe considered it proper that the relations of the lady should know. No\ndoubt--I thought to myself--had Miss Vanlo not been thirty and damaged by\nthe climate he would have found it possible to entrust Fred Vanlo with\nthis confidence. And then the figure of Hermann’s niece appeared before\nmy mind’s eye, with the wealth of her opulent form, her rich youth, her\nlavish strength. With that powerful and immaculate vitality, her girlish\nform must have shouted aloud of life to that man, whereas poor Miss\nVanlo could only sing sentimental songs to the strumming of a piano.\n\n“And that Hermann hates me, I know it!” he cried in his undertone, with\na sudden recrudescence of anxiety. “I must tell them. It is proper that\nthey should know. You would say so yourself.”\n\nHe then murmured an utterly mysterious allusion to the necessity for\npeculiar domestic arrangements. Though my curiosity was excited I did\nnot want to hear any of his confidences. I feared he might give me a\npiece of information that would make my assumed role of match-maker\nodious--however unreal it was. I was aware that he could have the girl\nfor the asking; and keeping down a desire to laugh in his face, I\nexpressed a confident belief in my ability to argue away Hermann’s\ndislike for him. “I am sure I can make it all right,” I said. He looked\nvery pleased.\n\nAnd when we rose not a word had been said about towage! Not a word! The\ngame was won and the honour was safe. Oh! blessed white cotton umbrella!\nWe shook hands, and I was holding myself with difficulty from breaking\ninto a step dance of joy when he came back, striding all the length of\nthe verandah, and said doubtfully:\n\n“I say, captain, I have your word? You--you--won’t turn round?”\n\nHeavens! The fright he gave me. Behind his tone of doubt there was\nsomething desperate and menacing. The infatuated ass. But I was equal to\nthe situation.\n\n“My dear Falk,” I said, beginning to lie with a glibness and effrontery\nthat amazed me even at the time--“confidence for confidence.” (He had\nmade no confidences.) “I will tell you that I am already engaged to an\nextremely charming girl at home, and so you understand....”\n\nHe caught my hand and wrung it in a crushing grip.\n\n“Pardon me. I feel it every day more difficult to live alone...”\n\n“On rice and fish,” I interrupted smartly, giggling with the sheer\nnervousness of a danger escaped.\n\nHe dropped my hand as if it had become suddenly red hot. A moment of\nprofound silence ensued, as though something extraordinary had happened.\n\n“I promise you to obtain Hermann’s consent,” I faltered out at last, and\nit seemed to me that he could not help seeing through that humbugging\npromise. “If there’s anything else to get over I shall endeavour\nto stand by you,” I conceded further, feeling somehow defeated and\nover-borne; “but you must do your best yourself.”\n\n“I have been unfortunate once,” he muttered unemotionally, and turning\nhis back on me he went away, thumping slowly the plank floor as if his\nfeet had been shod with iron.\n\nNext morning, however, he was lively enough as man-boat, a combination\nof splashing and shouting; of the insolent commotion below with the\nsteady overbearing glare of the silent head-piece above. He turned us\nout most unnecessarily at an ungodly hour, but it was nearly eleven\nin the morning before he brought me up a cable’s length from Hermann’s\nship. And he did it very badly too, in a hurry, and nearly contriving to\nmiss altogether the patch of good holding ground, because, forsooth,\nhe had caught sight of Hermann’s niece on the poop. And so did I; and\nprobably as soon as he had seen her himself. I saw the modest, sleek\nglory of the tawny head, and the full, grey shape of the girlish print\nfrock she filled so perfectly, so satisfactorily, with the seduction of\nunfaltering curves--a very nymph of Diana the Huntress. And Diana the\nship sat, high-walled and as solid as an institution, on the smooth\nlevel of the water, the most uninspiring and respectable craft upon the\nseas, useful and ugly, devoted to the support of domestic virtues like\nany grocer’s shop on shore. At once Falk steamed away; for there was\nsome work for him to do. He would return in the evening.\n\nHe ranged close by us, passing out dead slow, without a hail. The beat\nof the paddle-wheels reverberating amongst the stony islets, as if from\nthe ruined walls of a vast arena, filled the anchorage confusedly with\nthe clapping sounds of a mighty and leisurely applause. Abreast of\nHermann’s ship he stopped the engines; and a profound silence reigned\nover the rocks, the shore and the sea, for the time it took him to raise\nhis hat aloft before the nymph of the grey print frock. I had snatched\nup my binoculars, and I can answer for it she didn’t stir a limb,\nstanding by the rail shapely and erect, with one of her hands grasping a\nrope at the height of her head, while the way of the tug carried slowly\npast her the lingering and profound homage of the man. There was for me\nan enormous significance in the scene, the sense of having witnessed\na solemn declaration. The die was cast. After such a manifestation he\ncouldn’t back out. And I reflected that it was nothing whatever to me\nnow. With a rush of black smoke belching suddenly out of the funnel, and\na mad swirl of paddle-wheels provoking a burst of weird and precipitated\nclapping, the tug shot out of the desolate arena. The rocky islets lay\non the sea like the heaps of a cyclopean ruin on a plain; the centipedes\nand scorpions lurked under the stones; there was not a single blade\nof grass in sight anywhere, not a single lizard sunning himself on a\nboulder by the shore. When I looked again at Hermann’s ship the girl\nhad disappeared. I could not detect the smallest dot of a bird on the\nimmense sky, and the flatness of the land continued the flatness of the\nsea to the naked line of the horizon.\n\nThis is the setting now inseparably connected with my knowledge of\nFalk’s misfortune. My diplomacy had brought me there, and now I had only\nto wait the time for taking up the role of an ambassador. My diplomacy\nwas a success; my ship was safe; old Gambril would probably live; a\nfeeble sound of a tapping hammer came intermittently from the Diana.\nDuring the afternoon I looked at times at the old homely ship, the\nfaithful nurse of Hermann’s progeny, or yawned towards the distant\ntemple of Buddha, like a lonely hillock on the plain, where shaven\npriests cherish the thoughts of that Annihilation which is the worthy\nreward of us all. Unfortunate! He had been unfortunate once. Well, that\nwas not so bad as life goes. And what the devil could be the nature\nof that misfortune? I remembered that I had known a man before who had\ndeclared himself to have fallen, years ago, a victim to misfortune; but\nthis misfortune, whose effects appeared permanent (he looked desperately\nhard up) when considered dispassionately, seemed indistinguishable from\na breach of trust. Could it be something of that nature? Apart, however,\nfrom the utter improbability that he would offer to talk of it even to\nhis future uncle-in-law, I had a strange feeling that Falk’s physique\nunfitted him for that sort of delinquency. As the person of Hermann’s\nniece exhaled the profound physical charm of feminine form, so her\nadorer’s big frame embodied to my senses the hard, straight masculinity\nthat would conceivably kill but would not condescend to cheat. The thing\nwas obvious. I might just as well have suspected the girl of a curvature\nof the spine. And I perceived that the sun was about to set.\n\nThe smoke of Falk’s tug hove in sight, far away at the mouth of the\nriver. It was time for me to assume the character of an ambassador, and\nthe negotiation would not be difficult except in the matter of keeping\nmy countenance. It was all too extravagantly nonsensical, and I\nconceived that it would be best to compose for myself a grave demeanour.\nI practised this in my boat as I went along, but the bashfulness that\ncame secretly upon me the moment I stepped on the deck of the Diana is\ninexplicable. As soon as we had exchanged greetings Hermann asked me\neagerly if I knew whether Falk had found his white parasol.\n\n“He’s going to bring it to you himself directly,” I said with great\nsolemnity. “Meantime I am charged with an important message for which he\nbegs your favourable consideration. He is in love with your niece....”\n\n“Ach So!” he hissed with an animosity that made my assumed gravity\nchange into the most genuine concern. What meant this tone? And I\nhurried on.\n\n“He wishes, with your consent of course, to ask her to marry him at\nonce--before you leave here, that is. He would speak to the Consul.”\n\nHermann sat down and smoked violently. Five minutes passed in that\nfurious meditation, and then, taking the long pipe out of his mouth,\nhe burst into a hot diatribe against Falk--against his cupidity, his\nstupidity (a fellow that can hardly be got to say “yes” or “no” to the\nsimplest question)--against his outrageous treatment of the shipping in\nport (because he saw they were at his mercy)--and against his manner\nof walking, which to his (Hermann’s) mind showed a conceit positively\nunbearable. The damage to the old Diana was not forgotten, of course,\nand there was nothing of any nature said or done by Falk (even to the\nlast offer of refreshment in the hotel) that did not seem to have been\na cause of offence. “Had the cheek” to drag him (Hermann) into that\ncoffee-room; as though a drink from him could make up for forty-seven\ndollars and fifty cents of damage in the cost of wood alone--not\ncounting two days’ work for the carpenter. Of course he would not stand\nin the girl’s way. He was going home to Germany. There were plenty of\npoor girls walking about in Germany.\n\n“He’s very much in love,” was all I found to say.\n\n“Yes,” he cried. “And it is time too after making himself and me talked\nabout ashore the last voyage I was here, and then now again; coming on\nboard every evening unsettling the girl’s mind, and saying nothing. What\nsort of conduct is that?”\n\nThe seven thousand dollars the fellow was always talking about did not,\nin his opinion, justify such behaviour. Moreover, nobody had seen them.\nHe (Hermann) seriously doubted if there were seven thousand cents, and\nthe tug, no doubt, was mortgaged up to the top of the funnel to the firm\nof Siegers. But let that pass. He wouldn’t stand in the girl’s way. Her\nhead was so turned that she had become no good to them of late. Quite\nunable even to put the children to bed without her aunt. It was bad for\nthe children; they got unruly; and yesterday he actually had to give\nGustav a thrashing.\n\nFor that, too, Falk was made responsible apparently. And looking at my\nHermann’s heavy, puffy, good-natured face, I knew he would not exert\nhimself till greatly exasperated, and, therefore, would thrash very\nhard, and being fat would resent the necessity. How Falk had managed\nto turn the girl’s head was more difficult to understand. I supposed\nHermann would know. And then hadn’t there been Miss Vanlo? It could not\nbe his silvery tongue, or the subtle seduction of his manner; he had no\nmore of what is called “manner” than an animal--which, however, on the\nother hand, is never, and can never be called vulgar. Therefore it must\nhave been his bodily appearance, exhibiting a virility of nature\nas exaggerated as his beard, and resembling a sort of constant\nruthlessness. It was seen in the very manner he lolled in the chair. He\nmeant no offence, but his intercourse was characterised by that sort of\nfrank disregard of susceptibilities a man of seven foot six, living in a\nworld of dwarfs, would naturally assume, without in the least wishing to\nbe unkind. But amongst men of his own stature, or nearly, this frank\nuse of his advantages, in such matters as the awful towage bills for\ninstance, caused much impotent gnashing of teeth. When attentively\nconsidered it seemed appalling at times. He was a strange beast. But\nmaybe women liked it. Seen in that light he was well worth taming, and\nI suppose every woman at the bottom of her heart considers herself as a\ntamer of strange beasts. But Hermann arose with precipitation to carry\nthe news to his wife. I had barely the time, as he made for the cabin\ndoor, to grab him by the seat of his inexpressibles. I begged him to\nwait till Falk in person had spoken with him. There remained some small\nmatter to talk over, as I understood.\n\nHe sat down again at once, full of suspicion.\n\n“What matter?” he said surlily. “I have had enough of his nonsense.\nThere’s no matter at all, as he knows very well; the girl has nothing in\nthe world. She came to us in one thin dress when my brother died, and I\nhave a growing family.”\n\n“It can’t be anything of that kind,” I opined. “He’s desperately\nenamoured of your niece. I don’t know why he did not say so before. Upon\nmy word, I believe it is because he was afraid to lose, perhaps, the\nfelicity of sitting near her on your quarter deck.”\n\nI intimated my conviction that his love was so great as to be in a sense\ncowardly. The effects of a great passion are unaccountable. It has\nbeen known to make a man timid. But Hermann looked at me as if I had\nfoolishly raved; and the twilight was dying out rapidly.\n\n“You don’t believe in passion, do you, Hermann?” I said cheerily. “The\npassion of fear will make a cornered rat courageous. Falk’s in a corner.\nHe will take her off your hands in one thin frock just as she came to\nyou. And after ten years’ service it isn’t a bad bargain,” I added.\n\nFar from taking offence, he resumed his air of civic virtue. The sudden\nnight came upon him while he stared placidly along the deck, bringing in\ncontact with his thick lips, and taking away again after a jet of smoke,\nthe curved mouthpiece fitted to the stem of his pipe. The night came\nupon him and buried in haste his whiskers, his globular eyes, his puffy\npale face, his fat knees and the vast flat slippers on his fatherly\nfeet. Only his short arms in respectable white shirt-sleeves remained\nvery visible, propped up like the flippers of a seal reposing on the\nstrand.\n\n“Falk wouldn’t settle anything about repairs. Told me to find out first\nhow much wood I should require and he would see,” he remarked; and after\nhe had spat peacefully in the dusk we heard over the water the beat of\nthe tug’s floats. There is, on a calm night, nothing more suggestive of\nfierce and headlong haste than the rapid sound made by the paddle-wheels\nof a boat threshing her way through a quiet sea; and the approach of\nFalk towards his fate seemed to be urged by an impatient and passionate\ndesire. The engines must have been driven to the very utmost of their\nrevolutions. We heard them slow down at last, and, vaguely, the white\nhull of the tug appeared moving against the black islets, whilst a slow\nand rhythmical clapping as of thousands of hands rose on all sides. It\nceased all at once, just before Falk brought her up. A single brusque\nsplash was followed by the long drawn rumbling of iron links running\nthrough the hawse pipe. Then a solemn silence fell upon the Roadstead.\n\n“He will soon be here,” I murmured, and after that we waited for him\nwithout a word. Meantime, raising my eyes, I beheld the glitter of a\nlofty sky above the Diana’s mastheads. The multitude of stars gathered\ninto clusters, in rows, in lines, in masses, in groups, shone all\ntogether, unanimously--and the few isolated ones, blazing by themselves\nin the midst of dark patches, seemed to be of a superior kind and of\nan inextinguishable nature. But long striding footsteps were heard\nhastening along the deck; the high bulwarks of the Diana made a deeper\ndarkness. We rose from our chairs quickly, and Falk, appearing before\nus, all in white, stood still.\n\nNobody spoke at first, as though we had been covered with confusion. His\narrival was fiery, but his white bulk, of indefinite shape and without\nfeatures, made him loom up like a man of snow.\n\n“The captain here has been telling me...” Hermann began in a homely\nand amicable voice; and Falk had a low, nervous laugh. His cool,\nnegligent undertone had no inflexions, but the strength of a powerful\nemotion made him ramble in his speech. He had always desired a home.\nIt was difficult to live alone, though he was not answerable. He was\ndomestic; there had been difficulties; but since he had seen Hermann’s\nniece he found that it had become at last impossible to live by himself.\n“I mean--impossible,” he repeated with no sort of emphasis and only with\nthe slightest of pauses, but the word fell into my mind with the force\nof a new idea.\n\n“I have not said anything to her yet,” Hermann observed quietly. And\nFalk dismissed this by a “That’s all right. Certainly. Very proper.”\n There was a necessity for perfect frankness--in marrying, especially.\nHermann seemed attentive, but he seized the first opportunity to ask us\ninto the cabin. “And by-the-by, Falk,” he said innocently, as we passed\nin, “the timber came to no less than forty-seven dollars and fifty\ncents.”\n\nFalk, uncovering his head, lingered in the passage. “Some other time,”\n he said; and Hermann nudged me angrily--I don’t know why. The girl alone\nin the cabin sat sewing at some distance from the table. Falk stopped\nshort in the doorway. Without a word, without a sign, without the\nslightest inclination of his bony head, by the silent intensity of his\nlook alone, he seemed to lay his herculean frame at her feet. Her hands\nsank slowly on her lap, and raising her clear eyes, she let her soft,\nbeaming glance enfold him from head to foot like a slow and pale caress.\nHe was very hot when he sat down; she, with bowed head, went on with her\nsewing; her neck was very white under the light of the lamp; but Falk,\nhiding his face in the palms of his hands, shuddered faintly. He drew\nthem down, even to his beard, and his uncovered eyes astonished me by\ntheir tense and irrational expression--as though he had just swallowed\na heavy gulp of alcohol. It passed away while he was binding us to\nsecrecy. Not that he cared, but he did not like to be spoken about; and\nI looked at the girl’s marvellous, at her wonderful, at her regal hair,\nplaited tight into that one astonishing and maidenly tress. Whenever she\nmoved her well-shaped head it would stir stiffly to and fro on her back.\nThe thin cotton sleeve fitted the irreproachable roundness of her\narm like a skin; and her very dress, stretched on her bust, seemed to\npalpitate like a living tissue with the strength of vitality animating\nher body. How good her complexion was, the outline of her soft cheek and\nthe small convoluted conch of her rosy ear! To pull her needle she kept\nthe little finger apart from the others; it seemed a waste of power\nto see her sewing--eternally sewing--with that industrious and precise\nmovement of her arm, going on eternally upon all the oceans, under all\nthe skies, in innumerable harbours. And suddenly I heard Falk’s voice\ndeclare that he could not marry a woman unless she knew of something\nin his life that had happened ten years ago. It was an accident. An\nunfortunate accident. It would affect the domestic arrangements of their\nhome, but, once told, it need not be alluded to again for the rest of\ntheir lives. “I should want my wife to feel for me,” he said. “It\nhas made me unhappy.” And how could he keep the knowledge of it to\nhimself--he asked us--perhaps through years and years of companionship?\nWhat sort of companionship would that be? He had thought it over. A wife\nmust know. Then why not at once? He counted on Hermann’s kindness\nfor presenting the affair in the best possible light. And Hermann’s\ncountenance, mystified before, became very sour. He stole an inquisitive\nglance at me. I shook my head blankly. Some people thought, Falk went\non, that such an experience changed a man for the rest of his life. He\ncouldn’t say. It was hard, awful, and not to be forgotten, but he did\nnot think himself a worse man than before. Only he talked in his sleep\nnow, he believed.... At last I began to think he had accidentally\nkilled some one; perhaps a friend--his own father maybe; when he went on\nto say that probably we were aware he never touched meat. Throughout he\nspoke English, of course of my account.\n\nHe swayed forward heavily.\n\nThe girl, with her hands raised before her pale eyes, was threading her\nneedle. He glanced at her, and his mighty trunk overshadowed the table,\nbringing nearer to us the breadth of his shoulders, the thickness of\nhis neck, and that incongruous, anchorite head, burnt in the desert,\nhollowed and lean as if by excesses of vigils and fasting. His beard\nflowed imposingly downwards, out of sight, between the two brown hands\ngripping the edge of the table, and his persistent glance made sombre by\nthe wide dilations of the pupils, fascinated.\n\n“Imagine to yourselves,” he said in his ordinary voice, “that I have\neaten man.”\n\nI could only ejaculate a faint “Ah!” of complete enlightenment. But\nHermann, dazed by the excessive shock, actually murmured, “Himmel! What\nfor?”\n\n“It was my terrible misfortune to do so,” said Falk in a measured\nundertone. The girl, unconscious, sewed on. Mrs. Hermann was absent\nin one of the state-rooms, sitting up with Lena, who was feverish; but\nHermann suddenly put both his hands up with a jerk. The embroidered\ncalotte fell, and, in the twinkling of an eye, he had rumpled his hair\nall ends up in a most extravagant manner. In this state he strove to\nspeak; with every effort his eyes seemed to start further out of their\nsockets; his head looked like a mop. He choked, gasped, swallowed, and\nmanaged to shriek out the one word, “Beast!”\n\nFrom that moment till Falk went out of the cabin the girl, with her\nhands folded on the work lying in her lap, never took her eyes off him.\nHis own, in the blindness of his heart, darted all over the cabin, only\nseeking to avoid the sight of Hermann’s raving. It was ridiculous, and\nwas made almost terrible by the stillness of every other person present.\nIt was contemptible, and was made appalling by the man’s over-mastering\nhorror of this awful sincerity, coming to him suddenly, with the\nconfession of such a fact. He walked with great strides; he gasped. He\nwanted to know from Falk how dared he to come and tell him this? Did he\nthink himself a proper person to be sitting in this cabin where his wife\nand children lived? Tell his niece! Expected him to tell his niece!\nHis own brother’s daughter! Shameless! Did I ever hear tell of such\nimpudence?--he appealed to me. “This man here ought to have gone and\nhidden himself out of sight instead of...”\n\n“But it’s a great misfortune for me. But it’s a great misfortune for\nme,” Falk would ejaculate from time to time.\n\nHowever, Hermann kept on running frequently against the corners of the\ntable. At last he lost a slipper, and crossing his arms on his breast,\nwalked up with one stocking foot very close to Falk, in order to ask\nhim whether he did think there was anywhere on earth a woman abandoned\nenough to mate with such a monster. “Did he? Did he? Did he?” I tried\nto restrain him. He tore himself out of my hands; he found his slipper,\nand, endeavouring to put it on, stormed standing on one leg--and Falk,\nwith a face unmoved and averted eyes, grasped all his mighty beard in\none vast palm.\n\n“Was it right then for me to die myself?” he asked thoughtfully. I laid\nmy hand on his shoulder.\n\n“Go away,” I whispered imperiously, without any clear reason for this\nadvice, except that I wished to put an end to Hermann’s odious noise.\n“Go away.”\n\nHe looked searchingly for a moment at Hermann before he made a move.\nI left the cabin too to see him out of the ship. But he hung about the\nquarter-deck.\n\n“It is my misfortune,” he said in a steady voice.\n\n“You were stupid to blurt it out in such a manner. After all, we don’t\nhear such confidences every day.”\n\n“What does the man mean?” he mused in deep undertones. “Somebody had to\ndie--but why me?”\n\nHe remained still for a time in the dark--silent; almost invisible. All\nat once he pinned my elbows to my sides. I felt utterly powerless in his\ngrip, and his voice, whispering in my ear, vibrated.\n\n“It’s worse than hunger. Captain, do you know what that means? And I\ncould kill then--or be killed. I wish the crowbar had smashed my skull\nten years ago. And I’ve got to live now. Without her. Do you understand?\nPerhaps many years. But how? What can be done? If I had allowed myself\nto look at her once I would have carried her off before that man in my\nhands--like this.”\n\nI felt myself snatched off the deck, then suddenly dropped--and I\nstaggered backwards, feeling bewildered and bruised. What a man! All was\nstill; he was gone. I heard Hermann’s voice declaiming in the cabin, and\nI went in.\n\nI could not at first make out a single word, but Mrs. Hermann, who,\nattracted by the noise, had come in some time before, with an expression\nof surprise and mild disapproval, depicted broadly on her face, was\ngiving now all the signs of profound, helpless agitation. Her husband\nshot a string of guttural words at her, and instantly putting out one\nhand to the bulkhead as if to save herself from falling, she clutched\nthe loose bosom of her dress with the other. He harangued the two women\nextraordinarily, with much of his shirt hanging out of his waist-belt,\nstamping his foot, turning from one to the other, sometimes throwing\nboth his arms together, straight up above his rumpled hair, and keeping\nthem in that position while he uttered a passage of loud denunciation;\nat others folding them tight across his breast--and then he hissed with\nindignation, elevating his shoulders and protruding his head. The girl\nwas crying.\n\nShe had not changed her attitude. From her steady eyes that, following\nFalk in his retreat, had remained fixed wistfully on the cabin door, the\ntears fell rapid, thick, on her hands, on the work in her lap, warm\nand gentle like a shower in spring. She wept without grimacing, without\nnoise--very touching, very quiet, with something more of pity than of\npain in her face, as one weeps in compassion rather than in grief--and\nHermann, before her, declaimed. I caught several times the word\n“Mensch,” man; and also “Fressen,” which last I looked up afterwards\nin my dictionary. It means “Devour.” Hermann seemed to be requesting an\nanswer of some sort from her; his whole body swayed. She remained mute\nand perfectly still; at last his agitation gained her; she put the palms\nof her hands together, her full lips parted, no sound came. His voice\nscolded shrilly, his arms went like a windmill--suddenly he shook a\nthick fist at her. She burst out into loud sobs. He seemed stupefied.\n\nMrs. Hermann rushed forward babbling rapidly. The two women fell on each\nother’s necks, and, with an arm round her niece’s waist, she led her\naway. Her own eyes were simply streaming, her face was flooded. She\nshook her head back at me negatively, I wonder why to this day. The\ngirl’s head dropped heavily on her shoulder. They disappeared.\n\nThen Hermann sat down and stared at the cabin floor.\n\n“We don’t know all the circumstances,” I ventured to break the silence.\nHe retorted tartly that he didn’t want to know of any. According to his\nideas no circumstances could excuse a crime--and certainly not such\na crime. This was the opinion generally received. The duty of a human\nbeing was to starve. Falk therefore was a beast, an animal; base, low,\nvile, despicable, shameless, and deceitful. He had been deceiving him\nsince last year. He was, however, inclined to think that Falk must\nhave gone mad quite recently; for no sane person, without necessity,\nuselessly, for no earthly reason, and regardless of another’s\nself-respect and peace of mind, would own to having devoured human\nflesh. “Why tell?” he cried. “Who was asking him?” It showed Falk’s\nbrutality because after all he had selfishly caused him (Hermann) much\npain. He would have preferred not to know that such an unclean creature\nhad been in the habit of caressing his children. He hoped I would say\nnothing of all this ashore, though. He wouldn’t like it to get about\nthat he had been intimate with an eater of men--a common cannibal. As\nto the scene he had made (which I judged quite unnecessary) he was not\ngoing to inconvenience and restrain himself for a fellow that went about\ncourting and upsetting girls’ heads, while he knew all the time that\nno decent housewifely girl could think of marrying him. At least he\n(Hermann) could not conceive how any girl could. Fancy Lena!... No,\nit was impossible. The thoughts that would come into their heads every\ntime they sat down to a meal. Horrible! Horrible!\n\n“You are too squeamish, Hermann,” I said.\n\nHe seemed to think it was eminently proper to be squeamish if the word\nmeant disgust at Falk’s conduct; and turning up his eyes sentimentally\nhe drew my attention to the horrible fate of the victims--the\nvictims of that Falk. I said that I knew nothing about them. He\nseemed surprised. Could not anybody imagine without knowing? He--for\ninstance--felt he would like to avenge them. But what if--said I--there\nhad not been any? They might have died as it were, naturally--of\nstarvation. He shuddered. But to be eaten--after death! To be devoured!\nHe gave another deep shudder, and asked suddenly, “Do you think it is\ntrue?”\n\nHis indignation and his personality together would have been enough to\nspoil the reality of the most authentic thing. When I looked at him I\ndoubted the story--but the remembrance of Falk’s words, looks, gestures,\ninvested it not only with an air of reality but with the absolute truth\nof primitive passion.\n\n“It is true just as much as you are able to make it; and exactly in the\nway you like to make it. For my part, when I hear you clamouring about\nit, I don’t believe it is true at all.”\n\nAnd I left him pondering. The men in my boat lying at the foot of\nDiana’s side ladder told me that the captain of the tug had gone away in\nhis gig some time ago.\n\nI let my fellows pull an easy stroke; because of the heavy dew the clear\nsparkle of the stars seemed to fall on me cold and wetting. There was\na sense of lurking gruesome horror somewhere in my mind, and it was\nmingled with clear and grotesque images. Schomberg’s gastronomic\ntittle-tattle was responsible for these; and I half hoped I should never\nsee Falk again. But the first thing my anchor-watchman told me was that\nthe captain of the tug was on board. He had sent his boat away and was\nnow waiting for me in the cuddy.\n\nHe was lying full length on the stern settee, his face buried in the\ncushions. I had expected to see it discomposed, contorted, despairing.\nIt was nothing of the kind; it was just as I had seen it twenty times,\nsteady and glaring from the bridge of the tug. It was immovably set and\nhungry, dominated like the whole man by the singleness of one instinct.\n\nHe wanted to live. He had always wanted to live. So we all do--but in\nus the instinct serves a complex conception, and in him this instinct\nexisted alone. There is in such simple development a gigantic force,\nand like the pathos of a child’s naive and uncontrolled desire. He wanted\nthat girl, and the utmost that can be said for him was that he wanted\nthat particular girl alone. I think I saw then the obscure beginning,\nthe seed germinating in the soil of an unconscious need, the first shoot\nof that tree bearing now for a mature mankind the flower and the fruit,\nthe infinite gradation in shades and in flavour of our discriminating\nlove. He was a child. He was as frank as a child too. He was hungry for\nthe girl, terribly hungry, as he had been terribly hungry for food.\n\nDon’t be shocked if I declare that in my belief it was the same\nneed, the same pain, the same torture. We are in his case allowed to\ncontemplate the foundation of all the emotions--that one joy which is\nto live, and the one sadness at the root of the innumerable torments.\nIt was made plain by the way he talked. He had never suffered so. It was\ngnawing, it was fire; it was there, like this! And after pointing below\nhis breastbone, he made a hard wringing motion with his hands. And I\nassure you that, seen as I saw it with my bodily eyes, it was anything\nbut laughable. And again, as he was presently to tell me (alluding to an\nearly incident of the disastrous voyage when some damaged meat had been\nflung overboard), he said that a time soon came when his heart ached\n(that was the expression he used), and he was ready to tear his hair out\nat the thought of all that rotten beef thrown away.\n\nI had heard all this; I witnessed his physical struggles, seeing the\nworking of the rack and hearing the true voice of pain. I witnessed it\nall patiently, because the moment I came into the cuddy he had called\nupon me to stand by him--and this, it seems, I had diplomatically\npromised.\n\nHis agitation was impressive and alarming in the little cabin, like the\nfloundering of a great whale driven into a shallow cove in a coast. He\nstood up; he flung himself down headlong; he tried to tear the cushion\nwith his teeth; and again hugging it fiercely to his face he let himself\nfall on the couch. The whole ship seemed to feel the shock of his\ndespair; and I contemplated with wonder the lofty forehead, the noble\ntouch of time on the uncovered temples, the unchanged hungry character\nof the face--so strangely ascetic and so incapable of portraying\nemotion.\n\nWhat should he do? He had lived by being near her. He had sat--in the\nevening--I knew?-all his life! She sewed. Her head was bent--so. Her\nhead--like this--and her arms. Ah! Had I seen? Like this.\n\nHe dropped on a stool, bowed his powerful neck whose nape was red,\nand with his hands stitched the air, ludicrous, sublimely imbecile and\ncomprehensible.\n\nAnd now he couldn’t have her? No! That was too much. After thinking too\nthat... What had he done? What was my advice? Take her by force? No?\nMustn’t he? Who was there then to kill him? For the first time I saw\none of his features move; a fighting teeth-baring curl of the lip....\n“Not Hermann, perhaps.” He lost himself in thought as though he had\nfallen out of the world.\n\nI may note that the idea of suicide apparently did not enter his head\nfor a single moment. It occurred to me to ask:\n\n“Where was it that this shipwreck of yours took place?”\n\n“Down south,” he said vaguely with a start.\n\n“You are not down south now,” I said. “Violence won’t do. They would\ntake her away from you in no time. And what was the name of the ship?”\n\n“Borgmester Dahl,” he said. “It was no shipwreck.”\n\nHe seemed to be waking up by degrees from that trance, and waking up\ncalmed.\n\n“Not a shipwreck? What was it?”\n\n“Break down,” he answered, looking more like himself every moment. By\nthis only I learned that it was a steamer. I had till then supposed they\nhad been starving in boats or on a raft--or perhaps on a barren rock.\n\n“She did not sink then?” I asked in surprise. He nodded. “We sighted the\nsouthern ice,” he pronounced dreamily.\n\n“And you alone survived?”\n\nHe sat down. “Yes. It was a terrible misfortune for me. Everything went\nwrong. All the men went wrong. I survived.”\n\nRemembering the things one reads of it was difficult to realise the true\nmeaning of his answers. I ought to have seen at once--but I did not; so\ndifficult is it for our minds, remembering so much, instructed so much,\ninformed of so much, to get in touch with the real actuality at our\nelbow. And with my head full of preconceived notions as to how a case of\n“cannibalism and suffering at sea” should be managed I said--“You were\nthen so lucky in the drawing of lots?”\n\n“Drawing of lots?” he said. “What lots? Do you think I would have\nallowed my life to go for the drawing of lots?”\n\nNot if he could help if, I perceived, no matter what other life went.\n\n“It was a great misfortune. Terrible. Awful,” he said. “Many heads went\nwrong, but the best men would live.”\n\n“The toughest, you mean,” I said. He considered the word. Perhaps it was\nstrange to him, though his English was so good.\n\n“Yes,” he asserted at last. “The best. It was everybody for himself at\nlast and the ship open to all.”\n\nThus from question to question I got the whole story. I fancy it was the\nonly way I could that night have stood by him. Outwardly at least he was\nhimself again; the first sign of it was the return of that incongruous\ntrick he had of drawing both his hands down his face--and it had its\nmeaning now, with that slight shudder of the frame and the passionate\nanguish of these hands uncovering a hungry immovable face, the wide\npupils of the intent, silent, fascinating eyes.\n\nIt was an iron steamer of a most respectable origin. The burgomaster\nof Falk’s native town had built her. She was the first steamer ever\nlaunched there. The burgomaster’s daughter had christened her. Country\npeople drove in carts from miles around to see her. He told me all this.\nHe got the berth as what we should call a chief mate. He seemed to think\nit had been a feather in his cap; and, in his own corner of the world,\nthis lover of life was of good parentage.\n\nThe burgomaster had advanced ideas in the ship-owning line. At that time\nnot every one would have known enough to think of despatching a cargo\nsteamer to the Pacific. But he loaded her with pitch-pine deals and sent\nher off to hunt for her luck. Wellington was to be the first port, I\nfancy. It doesn’t matter, because in latitude 44 d south and somewhere\nhalfway between Good Hope and New Zealand the tail shaft broke and the\npropeller dropped off.\n\nThey were steaming then with a fresh gale on the quarter and all their\ncanvas set, to help the engines. But by itself the sail power was not\nenough to keep way on her. When the propeller went the ship broached-to\nat once, and the masts got whipped overboard.\n\nThe disadvantage of being dismasted consisted in this, that they had\nnothing to hoist flags on to make themselves visible at a distance. In\nthe course of the first few days several ships failed to sight them; and\nthe gale was drifting them out of the usual track. The voyage had been,\nfrom the first, neither very successful nor very harmonious. There had\nbeen quarrels on board. The captain was a clever, melancholic man, who\nhad no unusual grip on his crew. The ship had been amply provisioned for\nthe passage, but, somehow or other, several barrels of meat were found\nspoiled on opening, and had been thrown overboard soon after leaving\nhome, as a sanitary measure. Afterwards the crew of the Borgmester Dahl\nthought of that rotten carrion with tears of regret, covetousness and\ndespair.\n\nShe drove south. To begin with, there had been an appearance of\norganisation, but soon the bonds of discipline became relaxed. A sombre\nidleness succeeded. They looked with sullen eyes at the horizon. The\ngales increased: she lay in the trough, the seas made a clean breach\nover her. On one frightful night, when they expected their hulk to turn\nover with them every moment, a heavy sea broke on board, deluged the\nstore-rooms and spoiled the best part of the remaining provisions. It\nseems the hatch had not been properly secured. This instance of neglect\nis characteristic of utter discouragement. Falk tried to inspire some\nenergy into his captain, but failed. From that time he retired more into\nhimself, always trying to do his utmost in the situation. It grew worse.\nGale succeeded gale, with black mountains of water hurling themselves on\nthe Borgmester Dahl. Some of the men never left their bunks; many became\nquarrelsome. The chief engineer, an old man, refused to speak at all to\nanybody. Others shut themselves up in their berths to cry. On calm days\nthe inert steamer rolled on a leaden sea under a murky sky, or showed,\nin sunshine, the squalor of sea waifs, the dried white salt, the rust,\nthe jagged broken places. Then the gales came again. They kept body and\nsoul together on short rations. Once, an English ship, scudding in a\nstorm, tried to stand by them, heaving-to pluckily under their lee. The\nseas swept her decks; the men in oilskins clinging to her rigging looked\nat them, and they made desperate signs over their shattered bulwarks.\nSuddenly her main-topsail went, yard and all, in a terrific squall; she\nhad to bear up under bare poles, and disappeared.\n\nOther ships had spoken them before, but at first they had refused to be\ntaken off, expecting the assistance of some steamer. There were very few\nsteamers in those latitudes then; and when they desired to leave this\ndead and drifting carcase, no ship came in sight. They had drifted south\nout of men’s knowledge. They failed to attract the attention of a lonely\nwhaler, and very soon the edge of the polar ice-cap rose from the sea\nand closed the southern horizon like a wall. One morning they were\nalarmed by finding themselves floating amongst detached pieces of ice.\nBut the fear of sinking passed away like their vigour, like their hopes;\nthe shocks of the floes knocking against the ship’s side could not\nrouse them from their apathy: and the Borgmester Dahl drifted out again\nunharmed into open water. They hardly noticed the change.\n\nThe funnel had gone overboard in one of the heavy rolls; two of their\nthree boats had disappeared, washed away in bad weather, and the davits\nswung to and fro, unsecured, with chafed rope’s ends waggling to the\nroll. Nothing was done on board, and Falk told me how he had often\nlistened to the water washing about the dark engine-room where the\nengines, stilled for ever, were decaying slowly into a mass of rust, as\nthe stilled heart decays within the lifeless body. At first, after the\nloss of the motive power, the tiller had been thoroughly secured by\nlashings. But in course of time these had rotted, chafed, rusted,\nparting one by one: and the rudder, freed, banged heavily to and fro\nnight and day, sending dull shocks through the whole frame of the\nvessel. This was dangerous. Nobody cared enough to lift a little finger.\nHe told me that even now sometimes waking up at night, he fancied he\ncould hear the dull vibrating thuds. The pintles carried away, and it\ndropped off at last.\n\nThe final catastrophe came with the sending off of their one remaining\nboat. It was Falk who had managed to preserve her intact, and now it\nwas agreed that some of the hands should sail away into the track of the\nshipping to procure assistance. She was provisioned with all the food\nthey could spare for the six who were to go. They waited for a fine day.\nIt was long in coming. At last one morning they lowered her into the\nwater.\n\nDirectly, in that demoralised crowd, trouble broke out. Two men who\nhad no business there had jumped into the boat under the pretence of\nunhooking the tackles, while some sort of squabble arose on the deck\namongst these weak, tottering spectres of a ship’s company. The\ncaptain, who had been for days living secluded and unapproachable in the\nchart-room, came to the rail. He ordered the two men to come up on board\nand menaced them with his revolver. They pretended to obey, but suddenly\ncutting the boat’s painter, gave a shove against the ship’s side and\nmade ready to hoist the sail.\n\n“Shoot, sir! Shoot them down!” cried Falk-“and I will jump overboard to\nregain the boat.” But the captain, after taking aim with an irresolute\narm, turned suddenly away.\n\nA howl of rage arose. Falk dashed into his cabin for his own pistol.\nWhen he returned it was too late. Two more men had leaped into the\nwater, but the fellows in the boat beat them off with the oars, hoisted\nthe boat’s lug and sailed away. They were never heard of again.\n\nConsternation and despair possessed the remaining ship’s company,\ntill the apathy of utter hopelessness re-asserted its sway. That day a\nfireman committed suicide, running up on deck with his throat cut from\near to ear, to the horror of all hands. He was thrown overboard. The\ncaptain had locked himself in the chart-room, and Falk, knocking vainly\nfor admittance, heard him reciting over and over again the names of his\nwife and children, not as if calling upon them or commending them to\nGod, but in a mechanical voice like an exercise of memory. Next day the\ndoors of the chart-room were swinging open to the roll of the ship, and\nthe captain had disappeared. He must during the night have jumped into\nthe sea. Falk locked both the doors and kept the keys.\n\nThe organised life of the ship had come to an end. The solidarity of\nthe men had gone. They became indifferent to each other. It was Falk\nwho took in hand the distribution of such food as remained. They boiled\ntheir boots for soup to eke out the rations, which only made their\nhunger more intolerable. Sometimes whispers of hate were heard passing\nbetween the languid skeletons that drifted endlessly to and fro, north\nand south, east and west, upon that carcase of a ship.\n\nAnd in this lies the grotesque horror of this sombre story. The last\nextremity of sailors, overtaking a small boat or a frail craft, seems\neasier to bear, because of the direct danger of the seas. The confined\nspace, the close contact, the imminent menace of the waves, seem to draw\nmen together, in spite of madness, suffering and despair. But there\nwas a ship--safe, convenient, roomy: a ship with beds, bedding, knives,\nforks, comfortable cabins, glass and china, and a complete cook’s\ngalley, pervaded, ruled and possessed by the pitiless spectre of\nstarvation. The lamp oil had been drunk, the wicks cut up for food, the\ncandles eaten. At night she floated dark in all her recesses, and full\nof fears. One day Falk came upon a man gnawing a splinter of pine wood.\nSuddenly he threw the piece of wood away, tottered to the rail, and fell\nover. Falk, too late to prevent the act, saw him claw the ship’s side\ndesperately before he went down. Next day another man did the same\nthing, after uttering horrible imprecations. But this one somehow\nmanaged to get hold of the broken rudder chains and hung on there,\nsilently. Falk set about trying to save him, and all the time the man,\nholding with both hands, looked at him anxiously with his sunken eyes.\nThen, just as Falk was ready to put his hand on him, the man let go his\nhold and sank like a stone. Falk reflected on these sights. His heart\nrevolted against the horror of death, and he said to himself that he\nwould struggle for every precious minute of his life.\n\nOne afternoon--as the survivors lay about on the after deck--the\ncarpenter, a tall man with a black beard, spoke of the last sacrifice.\nThere was nothing eatable left on board. Nobody said a word to this; but\nthat company separated quickly, these listless feeble spectres slunk\noff one by one to hide in fear of each other. Falk and the carpenter\nremained on deck together. Falk liked the big carpenter. He had been the\nbest man of the lot, helpful and ready as long as there was anything to\ndo, the longest hopeful, and had preserved to the last some vigour and\ndecision of mind.\n\nThey did not speak to each other. Henceforth no voices were to be heard\nconversing sadly on board that ship. After a time the carpenter tottered\naway forward; but later on, Falk going to drink at the fresh-water pump,\nhad the inspiration to turn his head. The carpenter had stolen upon him\nfrom behind, and, summoning all his strength, was aiming with a crowbar\na blow at the back of his skull.\n\nDodging just in time, Falk made his escape and ran into his cabin. While\nhe was loading his revolver there, he heard the sound of heavy blows\nstruck upon the bridge. The locks of the chartroom doors were slight,\nthey flew open, and the carpenter, possessing himself of the captain’s\nrevolver, fired a shot of defiance.\n\nFalk was about to go on deck and have it out at once, when he remarked\nthat one of the ports of his cabin commanded the approaches to the\nfreshwater pump. Instead of going out he remained in and secured the\ndoor. “The best man shall survive,” he said to himself--and the other,\nhe reasoned, must at some time or other come there to drink. These\nstarving men would drink often to cheat the pangs of their hunger. But\nthe carpenter too must have noticed the position of the port. They were\nthe two best men in the ship, and the game was with them. All the rest\nof the day Falk saw no one and heard no sound. At night he strained his\neyes. It was dark--he heard a rustling noise once, but he was certain\nthat no one could have come near the pump. It was to the left of his\ndeck port, and he could not have failed to see a man, for the night was\nclear and starry. He saw nothing; towards morning another faint noise\nmade him suspicious. Deliberately and quietly he unlocked his door. He\nhad not slept, and had not given way to the horror of the situation. He\nwanted to live.\n\nBut during the night the carpenter, without at all trying to approach\nthe pump, had managed to creep quietly along the starboard bulwark, and,\nunseen, had crouched down right under Falk’s deck port. When daylight\ncame he rose up suddenly, looked in, and putting his arm through the\nround brass framed opening, fired at Falk within a foot. He missed--and\nFalk, instead of attempting to seize the arm holding the weapon, opened\nhis door unexpectedly, and with the muzzle of his long revolver nearly\ntouching the other’s side, shot him dead.\n\nThe best man had survived. Both of them had at the beginning just\nstrength enough to stand on their feet, and both had displayed pitiless\nresolution, endurance, cunning and courage--all the qualities of classic\nheroism. At once Falk threw overboard the captain’s revolver. He was a\nborn monopolist. Then after the report of the two shots, followed by a\nprofound silence, there crept out into the cold, cruel dawn of Antarctic\nregions, from various hiding-places, over the deck of that dismantled\ncorpse of a ship floating on a grey sea ruled by iron necessity and with\na heart of ice--there crept into view one by one, cautious, slow, eager,\nglaring, and unclean, a band of hungry and livid skeletons. Falk faced\nthem, the possessor of the only fire-arm on board, and the second best\nman--the carpenter--was lying dead between him and them.\n\n“He was eaten, of course,” I said.\n\nHe bent his head slowly, shuddered a little, drawing his hands over his\nface, and said, “I had never any quarrel with that man. But there were\nour lives between him and me.”\n\nWhy continue the story of that ship, that story before which, with its\nfresh-water pump like a spring of death, its man with the weapon, the\nsea ruled by iron necessity, its spectral band swayed by terror and\nhope, its mute and unhearing heaven?-the fable of the Flying Dutchman\nwith its convention of crime and its sentimental retribution fades like\na graceful wreath, like a wisp of white mist. What is there to say that\nevery one of us cannot guess for himself? I believe Falk began by going\nthrough the ship, revolver in hand, to annex all the matches. Those\nstarving wretches had plenty of matches! He had no mind to have the ship\nset on fire under his feet, either from hate or from despair. He lived\nin the open, camping on the bridge, commanding all the after deck\nand the only approach to the pump. He lived! Some of the others lived\ntoo--concealed, anxious, coming out one by one from their hiding-places\nat the seductive sound of a shot. And he was not selfish. They shared,\nbut only three of them all were alive when a whaler, returning from her\ncruising ground, nearly ran over the water-logged hull of the Borgmester\nDahl, which, it seems, in the end had in some way sprung a leak in both\nher holds, but being loaded with deals could not sink.\n\n“They all died,” Falk said. “These three too, afterwards. But I would\nnot die. All died, all! under this terrible misfortune. But was I too to\nthrow away my life? Could I? Tell me, captain? I was alone there, quite\nalone, just like the others. Each man was alone. Was I to give up my\nrevolver? Who to? Or was I to throw it into the sea? What would\nhave been the good? Only the best man would survive. It was a great,\nterrible, and cruel misfortune.”\n\nHe had survived! I saw him before me as though preserved for a witness\nto the mighty truth of an unerring and eternal principle. Great beads\nof perspiration stood on his forehead. And suddenly it struck the table\nwith a heavy blow, as he fell forward throwing his hands out.\n\n“And this is worse,” he cried. “This is a worse pain! This is more\nterrible.”\n\nHe made my heart thump with the profound conviction of his cries. And\nafter he had left me alone I called up before my mental eye the image\nof the girl weeping silently, abundantly, patiently, and as if\nirresistibly. I thought of her tawny hair. I thought how, if unplaited,\nit would have covered her all round as low as the hips, like the hair of\na siren. And she had bewitched him. Fancy a man who would guard his\nown life with the inflexibility of a pitiless and immovable fate, being\nbrought to lament that once a crowbar had missed his skull! The sirens\nsing and lure to death, but this one had been weeping silently as if\nfor the pity of his life. She was the tender and voiceless siren of this\nappalling navigator. He evidently wanted to live his whole conception\nof life. Nothing else would do. And she too was a servant of that\nlife that, in the midst of death, cries aloud to our senses. She was\neminently fitted to interpret for him its feminine side. And in her own\nway, and with her own profusion of sensuous charms, she also seemed\nto illustrate the eternal truth of an unerring principle. I don’t know\nthough what sort of principle Hermann illustrated when he turned up\nearly on board my ship with a most perplexed air. It struck me, however,\nthat he too would do his best to survive. He seemed greatly calmed on\nthe subject of Falk, but still very full of it.\n\n“What is it you said I was last night? You know,” he asked after some\npreliminary talk. “Too--too--I don’t know. A very funny word.”\n\n“Squeamish?” I suggested.\n\n“Yes. What does it mean?”\n\n“That you exaggerate things--to yourself. Without inquiry, and so on.”\n\nHe seemed to turn it over in his mind. We went on talking. This Falk was\nthe plague of his life. Upsetting everybody like this! Mrs. Hermann was\nunwell rather this morning. His niece was crying still. There was nobody\nto look after the children. He struck his umbrella on the deck. She\nwould be like that for months. Fancy carrying all the way home, second\nclass, a perfectly useless girl who is crying all the time. It was\nbad for Lena too, he observed; but on what grounds I could not guess.\nPerhaps of the bad example. That child was already sorrowing and crying\nenough over the rag doll. Nicholas was really the least sentimental\nperson of the family.\n\n“Why does she weep?” I asked.\n\n“From pity,” cried Hermann.\n\nIt was impossible to make out women. Mrs. Hermann was the only one he\npretended to understand. She was very, very upset and doubtful.\n\n“Doubtful about what?” I asked.\n\nHe averted his eyes and did not answer this. It was impossible to make\nthem out. For instance, his niece was weeping for Falk. Now he (Hermann)\nwould like to wring his neck--but then... He supposed he had too\ntender a heart. “Frankly,” he asked at last, “what do you think of what\nwe heard last night, captain?”\n\n“In all these tales,” I observed, “there is always a good deal of\nexaggeration.”\n\nAnd not letting him recover from his surprise I assured him that I knew\nall the details. He begged me not to repeat them. His heart was too\ntender. They made him feel unwell. Then, looking at his feet and\nspeaking very slowly, he supposed that he need not see much of them\nafter they were married. For, indeed, he could not bear the sight of\nFalk. On the other hand it was ridiculous to take home a girl with her\nhead turned. A girl that weeps all the time and is of no help to her\naunt.\n\n“Now you will be able to do with one cabin only on your passage home,” I\nsaid.\n\n“Yes, I had thought of that,” he said brightly, almost. “Yes! Himself,\nhis wife, four children--one cabin might do. Whereas if his niece\nwent...”\n\n“And what does Mrs. Hermann say to it?” I inquired.\n\nMrs. Hermann did not know whether a man of that sort could make a girl\nhappy--she had been greatly deceived in Captain Falk. She had been very\nupset last night.\n\nThose good people did not seem to be able to retain an impression for a\nwhole twelve hours. I assured him on my own personal knowledge that\nFalk possessed in himself all the qualities to make his niece’s future\nprosperous. He said he was glad to hear this, and that he would tell his\nwife. Then the object of the visit came out. He wished me to help him to\nresume relations with Falk. His niece, he said, had expressed the hope I\nwould do so in my kindness. He was evidently anxious that I should,\nfor though he seemed to have forgotten nine-tenths of his last night’s\nopinions and the whole of his indignation, yet he evidently feared to\nbe sent to the right-about. “You told me he was very much in love,” he\nconcluded slyly, and leered in a sort of bucolic way.\n\nAs soon as he had left my ship I called Falk on board by signal--the\ntug still lying at the anchorage. He took the news with calm gravity,\nas though he had all along expected the stars to fight for him in their\ncourses.\n\nI saw them once more together, and only once--on the quarter-deck of the\nDiana. Hermann sat smoking with a shirt-sleeved elbow hooked over the\nback of his chair. Mrs. Hermann was sewing alone. As Falk stepped over\nthe gangway, Hermann’s niece, with a slight swish of the skirt and a\nswift friendly nod to me, glided past my chair.\n\nThey met in sunshine abreast of the mainmast. He held her hands and\nlooked down at them, and she looked up at him with her candid and\nunseeing glance. It seemed to me they had come together as if attracted,\ndrawn and guided to each other by a mysterious influence. They were a\ncomplete couple. In her grey frock, palpitating with life, generous of\nform, olympian and simple, she was indeed the siren to fascinate that\ndark navigator, this ruthless lover of the five senses. From afar I\nseemed to feel the masculine strength with which he grasped those hands\nshe had extended to him with a womanly swiftness. Lena, a little pale,\nnursing her beloved lump of dirty rags, ran towards her big friend; and\nthen in the drowsy silence of the good old ship Mrs. Hermann’s voice\nrang out so changed that it made me spin round in my chair to see what\nwas the matter.\n\n“Lena, come here!” she screamed. And this good-natured matron gave me a\nwavering glance, dark and full of fearsome distrust. The child ran\nback, surprised to her knee. But the two, standing before each other in\nsunlight with clasped hands, had heard nothing, had seen nothing and no\none. Three feet away from them in the shade a seaman sat on a spar, very\nbusy splicing a strop, and dipping his fingers into a tar-pot, as if\nutterly unaware of their existence.\n\nWhen I returned in command of another ship, some five years afterwards,\nMr. and Mrs. Falk had left the place. I should not wonder if Schomberg’s\ntongue had succeeded at last in scaring Falk away for good; and,\nindubitably, there was a tale still going about the town of a certain\nFalk, owner of a tug, who had won his wife at cards from the captain of\nan English ship.\n\n\nTHE END",
