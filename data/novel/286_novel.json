There was no telling\nwhat minute May might take it into her head that she was a little\nsister and reach him first.  Maybe he wanted me to do something for\nhim, and I loved to wait on Laddie.\n\n\"Ask mother if you may go with me a while.\"\n\n\"Mother doesn't care where I am, if I come when the supper bell rings.\"\n\n\"All right!\" said Laddie.\n\nHe led the way around the house, sat on the front step and took me\nbetween his knees.\n\n\"Oh, is it going to be a secret?\" I cried.\n\nSecrets with Laddie were the greatest joy in life.  He was so big and\nso handsome.  He was so much nicer than any one else in our family, or\namong our friends, that to share his secrets, run his errands, and love\nhim blindly was the greatest happiness.  Sometimes I disobeyed father\nand mother; I minded Laddie like his right hand.\n\n\"The biggest secret yet,\" he said gravely.\n\n\"Tell quick!\" I begged, holding my ear to his lips.\n\n\"Not so fast!\" said Laddie.  \"Not so fast!  I have doubts about this.\nI don't know that I should send you.  Possibly you can't find the way.\nYou may be afraid.  Above all, there is never to be a whisper.  Not to\nany one!  Do you understand?\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked.\n\n\"Something serious,\" said Laddie.  \"You see, I expected to have an hour\nor two for myself this afternoon, so I made an engagement to spend the\ntime with a Fairy Princess in our Big Woods.  Father and I broke the\nreaper taking it from the shed just now and you know how he is about\nFairies.\"\n\nI did know how he was about Fairies.  He hadn't a particle of patience\nwith them.  A Princess would be the Queen's daughter.  My father's\npeople were English, and I had heard enough talk to understand that.  I\nwas almost wild with excitement.\n\n\"Tell me the secret, hurry!\" I cried.\n\n\"It's just this,\" he said.  \"It took me a long time to coax the\nPrincess into our Big Woods.  I had to fix a throne for her to sit on;\nspread a Magic Carpet for her feet, and build a wall to screen her.\nNow, what is she going to think if I'm not there to welcome her when\nshe comes?  She promised to show me how to make sunshine on dark days.\"\n\n\"Tell father and he can have Leon help him.\"\n\n\"But it is a secret with the Princess, and it's HERS as much as mine.\nIf I tell, she may not like it, and then she won't make me her Prince\nand send me on her errands.\"\n\n\"Then you don't dare tell a breath,\" I said.\n\n\"Will you go in my place, and carry her a letter to explain why I'm not\ncoming, Little Sister?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" I said stoutly, and then my heart turned right over; for I\nnever had been in our Big Woods alone, and neither mother nor father\nwanted me to go.  Passing Gypsies sometimes laid down the fence and\nwent there to camp.  Father thought all the wolves and wildcats were\ngone, he hadn't seen any in years, but every once in a while some one\nsaid they had, and he was not quite sure yet.  And that wasn't the\nbeginning of it.  Paddy Ryan had come back from the war wrong in his\nhead.  He wore his old army overcoat summer and winter, slept on the\nground, and ate whatever he could find.  Once Laddie and Leon, hunting\nsquirrels to make broth for mother on one of her bad days, saw him in\nour Big Woods and he was eating SNAKES.  If I found Pat Ryan eating a\nsnake, it would frighten me so I would stand still and let him eat me,\nif he wanted to, and perhaps he wasn't too crazy to see how plump I\nwas.  I seemed to see swarthy, dark faces, big, sleek cats dropping\nfrom limbs, and Paddy Ryan's matted gray hair, the flying rags of the\nold blue coat, and a snake in his hands.  Laddie was slipping the\nletter into my apron pocket.  My knees threatened to let me down.\n\n\"Must I lift the leaves and hunt for her, or will she come to me?\" I\nwavered.\n\n\"That's the biggest secret of all,\" said Laddie.  \"Since the Princess\nentered them, our woods are Enchanted, and there is no telling what\nwonderful things may happen any minute.  One of them is this: whenever\nthe Princess comes there, she grows in size until she is as big as, say\nour Sally, and she fills all the place with glory, until you are so\nblinded you scarcely can see her face.\"\n\n\"What is she like, Laddie?\" I questioned, so filled with awe and\ninterest, that fear was forgotten.\n\n\"She is taller than Sally,\" said Laddie.  \"Her face is oval, and her\ncheeks are bright.  Her eyes are big moonlit pools of darkness, and\nsilken curls fall over her shoulders.  One hair is strong enough for a\nlifeline that will draw a drowning man ashore, or strangle an unhappy\none.  But you will not see her.  I'm purposely sending you early, so\nyou can do what you are told and come back to me before she even\nreaches the woods.\"\n\n\"What am I to do, Laddie?\"\n\n\"You must put one hand in your apron pocket and take the letter in it,\nand as long as you hold it tight, nothing in the world can hurt you.\nGo out our lane to the Big Woods, climb the gate and walk straight back\nthe wagon road to the water.  When you reach that, you must turn to\nyour right and go toward Hoods' until you come to the pawpaw thicket.\nGo around that, look ahead, and you'll see the biggest beech tree you\never saw.  You know a beech, don't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" I said indignantly.  \"Father taught me beech with the\nother trees.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Laddie, \"straight before you will be a purple beech,\nand under it is the throne of the Princess, the Magic Carpet, and the\nwalls I made.  Among the beech roots there is a stone hidden with moss.\nRoll the stone back and there will be a piece of bark.  Lift that, lay\nthe letter in the box you'll find, and scamper to me like flying.  I'll\nbe at the barn with father.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" said Laddie.  \"It's possible that the Fairy Queen may have\nset the Princess spinning silk for the caterpillars to weave their\nlittle houses with this winter; and if she has, she may have left a\nletter there to tell me.  If there is one, put it in your pocket, hold\nit close every step of the way, and you'll be safe coming home as you\nwere going.  But you mustn't let a soul see it; you must slip it into\nmy pocket when I'm not looking.  If you let any one see, then the Magic\nwill be spoiled, and the Fairy won't come again.\"\n\n\"No one shall see,\" I promised.\n\n\"I knew you could be trusted,\" said Laddie, kissing and hugging me\nhard.  \"Now go!  If anything gets after you that such a big girl as you\nreally wouldn't be ashamed to be afraid of, climb on a fence and call.\nI'll be listening, and I'll come flying.  Now I must hurry.  Father\nwill think it's going to take me the remainder of the day to find the\nbolts he wants.\"\n\nWe went down the front walk between the rows of hollyhocks and\ntasselled lady-slippers, out the gate, and followed the road.  Laddie\nheld one of my hands tight, and in the other I gripped the letter in my\npocket.  So long as Laddie could see me, and the lane lay between open\nfields, I wasn't afraid.  I was thinking so deeply about our woods\nbeing Enchanted, and a tiny Fairy growing big as our Sally, because she\nwas in them, that I stepped out bravely.\n\nEvery few days I followed the lane as far back as the Big Gate.  This\nstood where four fields cornered, and opened into the road leading to\nthe woods.  Beyond it, I had walked on Sunday afternoons with father\nwhile he taught me all the flowers, vines, and bushes he knew, only he\ndidn't know some of the prettiest ones; I had to have books for them,\nand I was studying to learn enough that I could find out.  Or I had\nridden on the wagon with Laddie and Leon when they went to bring wood\nfor the cookstove, outoven, and big fireplace.  But to walk!  To go all\nalone!  Not that I didn't walk by myself over every other foot of the\nacres and acres of beautiful land my father owned; but plowed fields,\ngrassy meadows, wood pasture, and the orchard were different.  I played\nin them without a thought of fear.\n\nThe only things to be careful about were a little, shiny, slender\nsnake, with a head as bright as mother's copper kettle, and a big thick\none with patterns on its back like those in Laddie's geometry books,\nand a whole rattlebox on its tail; not to eat any berry or fruit I\ndidn't know without first asking father; and always to be sure to\nmeasure how deep the water was before I waded in alone.\n\nBut our Big Woods!  Leon said the wildcats would get me there.  I sat\nin our catalpa and watched the Gypsies drive past every summer.  Mother\nhated them as hard as ever she could hate any one, because once they\nhad stolen some fine shirts, with linen bosoms, that she had made by\nhand for father, and was bleaching on the grass.  If Gypsies should be\nin our west woods to-day and steal me, she would hate them worse than\never; because my mother loved me now, even if she didn't want me when I\nwas born.\n\nBut you could excuse her for that.  She had already bathed, spanked,\nsewed for, and reared eleven babies so big and strong not one of them\never even threatened to die.  When you thought of that, you could see\nshe wouldn't be likely to implore the Almighty to send her another,\njust to make her family even numbers.  I never felt much hurt at her,\nbut some of the others I never have forgiven and maybe I never will.\nAs long as there had been eleven babies, they should have been so\naccustomed to children that they needn't all of them have objected to\nme, all except Laddie, of course.  That was the reason I loved him so\nand tried to do every single thing he wanted me to, just the way he\nliked it done.  That was why I was facing the only spot on our land\nwhere I was in the slightest afraid; because he asked me to.\n\nIf he had told me to dance a jig on the ridgepole of our barn, I would\nhave tried it.\n\nSo I clasped the note, set my teeth, and climbed over the gate.  I\nwalked fast and kept my eyes straight before me.  If I looked on either\nside, sure as life I would see something I never had before, and be\ndown digging up a strange flower, chasing a butterfly, or watching a\nbird.  Besides, if I didn't look in the fence corners that I passed,\nmaybe I wouldn't see anything to scare me.  I was going along finely,\nand feeling better every minute as I went down the bank of an old creek\nthat had gone dry, and started up the other side toward the sugar camp\nnot far from the Big Woods.  The bed was full of weeds and as I passed\nthrough, away! went Something among them.\n\nBeside the camp shed there was corded wood, and the first thing I knew,\nI was on top of it.  The next, my hand was on the note in my pocket.\nMy heart jumped until I could see my apron move, and my throat went all\nstiff and dry.  I gripped the note and waited.\n\nFather believed God would take care of him.  I was only a little girl\nand needed help much more than a man; maybe God would take care of me.\nThere was nothing wrong in carrying a letter to the Fairy Princess.  I\nthought perhaps it would help if I should kneel on the top of the\nwoodpile and ask God to not let anything get me.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the less I felt like doing it, though,\nbecause really you have no business to ask God to take care of you,\nunless you KNOW you are doing right.  This was right, but in my heart I\nalso knew that if Laddie had asked me, I would be shivering on top of\nthat cordwood on a hot August day, when it was wrong.  On the whole, I\nthought it would be more honest to leave God out of it, and take the\nrisk myself.  That made me think of the Crusaders, and the little gold\ntrinket in father's chest till.  There were four shells on it and each\none stood for a trip on foot or horseback to the Holy City when you had\nto fight almost every step of the way.  Those shells meant that my\nfather's people had gone four times, so he said; that, although it was\naway far back, still each of us had a tiny share of the blood of the\nCrusaders in our veins, and that it would make us brave and strong, and\nwhenever we were afraid, if we would think of them, we never could do a\ncowardly thing or let any one else do one before us.  He said any one\nwith Crusader blood had to be brave as Richard the Lion-hearted.\nThinking about that helped ever so much, so I gripped the note and\nturned to take one last look at the house before I made a dash for the\ngate that led into the Big Woods.\n\nBeyond our land lay the farm of Jacob Hood, and Mrs. Hood always teased\nme because Laddie had gone racing after her when I was born.  She was\nin the middle of Monday's washing, and the bluing settled in the rinse\nwater and stained her white clothes in streaks it took months to bleach\nout.  I always liked Sarah Hood for coming and dressing me, though,\nbecause our Sally, who was big enough to have done it, was upstairs\ncrying and wouldn't come down.  I liked Laddie too, because he was the\nonly one of our family who went to my mother and kissed her, said he\nwas glad, and offered to help her.  Maybe the reason he went was\nbecause he had an awful scare, but anyway he WENT, and that was enough\nfor me.\n\nYou see it was this way: no one wanted me; as there had been eleven of\nus, every one felt that was enough.  May was six years old and in\nschool, and my mother thought there never would be any more babies.\nShe had given away the cradle and divided the baby clothes among my big\nmarried sisters and brothers, and was having a fine time and enjoying\nherself the most she ever had in her life.  The land was paid for long\nago; the house she had planned, builded as she wanted it; she had a big\nteam of matched grays and a carriage with side lamps and patent leather\ntrimmings; and sometimes there was money in the bank.  I do not know\nthat there was very much, but any at all was a marvel, considering how\nmany of us there were to feed, clothe, and send to college.  Mother was\nforty-six and father was fifty; so they felt young enough yet to have a\nfine time and enjoy life, and just when things were going best, I\nannounced that I was halfway over my journey to earth.\n\nYou can't blame my mother so much.  She must have been tired of babies\nand disliked to go back and begin all over after resting six years.\nAnd you mustn't be too hard on my father if he was not just overjoyed.\nHe felt sure the cook would leave, and she did.  He knew Sally would\nobject to a baby, when she wanted to begin having beaus, so he and\nmother talked it over and sent her away for a long visit to Ohio with\nfather's people, and never told her.  They intended to leave her there\nuntil I was over the colic, at least.  They knew the big married\nbrothers and sisters would object, and they did.  They said it would be\nembarrassing for their children to be the nieces and nephews of an aunt\nor uncle younger than themselves.  They said it so often and so\nemphatically that father was provoked and mother cried.  Shelley didn't\nlike it because she was going to school in Groveville, where Lucy, one\nof our married sisters, lived, and she was afraid I would make so much\nwork she would have to give up her books and friends and remain at\nhome.  There never was a baby born who was any less wanted than I was.\nI knew as much about it as any one else, because from the day I could\nunderstand, all of them, father, mother, Shelley, Sarah Hood, every one\nwho knew, took turns telling me how badly I was not wanted, how much\ntrouble I made, and how Laddie was the only one who loved me at first.\nBecause of that I was on the cordwood trying to find courage to go\nfarther.  Over and over Laddie had told me himself.  He had been to\nvisit our big sister Elizabeth over Sunday and about eight o'clock\nMonday morning he came riding down the road, and saw the most dreadful\nthing.  There was not a curl of smoke from the chimneys, not a\ntablecloth or pillowslip on the line, not a blind raised.  Laddie said\nhis heart went--just like mine did when the Something jumped in the\ncreek bed, no doubt.  Then he laid on the whip and rode.\n\nHe flung the rein over the hitching post, leaped the fence and reached\nthe back door.  The young green girl, who was all father could get when\nthe cook left, was crying.  So were Shelley and little May, although\nshe said afterward she had a boil on her heel and there was no one to\npoultice it.  Laddie leaned against the door casing, and it is easy\nenough to understand what he thought.  He told me he had to try twice\nbefore he could speak, and then he could only ask:  \"What's the matter?\"\n\nProbably May never thought she would have the chance, but the others\nwere so busy crying harder, now that they had an audience, that she was\nfirst to tell him:  \"We have got a little sister.\"\n\n\"Great Day!\" cried Laddie.  \"You made me think we had a funeral!  Where\nis mother, and where is my Little Sister?\"\n\nHe went bolting right into mother's room and kissed her like the\ngladdest boy alive; because he was only a boy then, and he told her how\nhappy he was that she was safe, and then he ASKED for me.\n\nHe said I was the only living creature in that house who was not\nshedding tears, and I didn't begin for about six months afterward.  In\nfact, not until Shelley taught me by pinching me if she had to rock the\ncradle; then I would cry so hard mother would have to take me.  He said\nhe didn't believe I'd ever have learned by myself.\n\nHe took a pillow from the bed, fixed it in the rocking chair and laid\nme on it.  When he found that father was hitching the horses to send\nLeon for Doctor Fenner, Laddie rode back after Sarah Hood and spoiled\nher washing.  It may be that the interest he always took in me had its\nbeginning in all of them scaring him with their weeping; even Sally,\nwhom father had to telegraph to come home, was upstairs crying, and she\nwas almost a woman.  It may be that all the tears they shed over not\nwanting me so scared Laddie that he went farther in his welcome than he\never would have thought of going if he hadn't done it for joy when he\nlearned his mother was safe.  I don't care about the reason.  It is\nenough for me that from the hour of my birth Laddie named me Little\nSister, seldom called me anything else, and cared for me all he\npossibly could to rest mother.  He took me to the fields with him in\nthe morning and brought me back on the horse before him at noon.  He\ncould plow with me riding the horse, drive a reaper with me on his\nknees, and hoe corn while I slept on his coat in a fence corner.  The\nwinters he was away at college left me lonely, and when he came back\nfor a vacation I was too happy for words.  Maybe it was wrong to love\nhim most.  I knew my mother cared for and wanted me now.  And all my\nsecrets were not with Laddie.  I had one with father that I was never\nto tell so long as he lived, but it was about the one he loved best,\nnext after mother.  Perhaps I should never tell it, but I wouldn't be\nsurprised if the family knew.  I followed Laddie like a faithful dog,\nwhen I was not gripping his waving hair and riding in triumph on his\nshoulders.  He never had to go so fast he couldn't take me on his back.\nHe never was in too big a hurry to be kind.  He always had patience to\nexplain every shell, leaf, bird, and flower I asked about.  I was just\nas much his when pretty young girls were around, and the house full of\ncompany, as when we were alone.  That was the reason I was shivering on\nthe cordwood, gripping his letter and thinking of all these things in\norder to force myself to go farther.\n\nI was excited about the Fairies too.  I often had close chances of\nseeing them, but I always just missed.  Now here was Laddie writing\nletters and expecting answers; our Big Woods Enchanted, a Magic Carpet\nand the Queen's daughter becoming our size so she could speak with him.\nNo doubt the Queen had her grow big as Shelley, when she sent her on an\nerrand to tell Laddie about how to make sunshine; because she was\nafraid if she went her real size he would accidentally step on her, he\nwas so dreadfully big.\n\nOr maybe her voice was so fine he could not hear what she said.  He had\ntold me I was to hurry, and I had gone as fast as I could until\nSomething jumped; since, I had been settled on that cordwood like\nRobinson Crusoe on his desert island.  I had to get down some time; I\nmight as well start.\n\nI gripped the letter, slid to the ground, and ran toward the big gate\nstraight before me.  I climbed it, clutched the note again, and ran\nblindly down the road through the forest toward the creek.  I could\nhurry there.  On either side of it I could not have run ten steps at a\ntime.  The big trees reached so high above me it seemed as if they\nwould push through the floor of Heaven.  I tried to shut my ears and\nrun so fast I couldn't hear a sound, and so going, I soon came to the\ncreek bank.  There I turned to my right and went slower, watching for\nthe pawpaw thicket.  On leaving the road I thought I would have to\ncrawl over logs and make my way; but there seemed to be kind of a path\nnot very plain, but travelled enough to follow.  It led straight to the\nthicket.  At the edge I stopped to look for the beech.  It could be\nreached in one breathless dash, but there seemed to be a green\nenclosure, so I walked around until I found an entrance.  Once there I\nwas so amazed I stood and stared.  I was half indignant too.\n\nLaddie hadn't done a thing but make an exact copy of my playhouse under\nthe biggest maiden's-blush in our orchard.  He used the immense beech\nfor one corner, where I had the apple tree.  His Magic Carpet was\nwoolly-dog moss, and all the magic about it, was that on the damp woods\nfloor, in the deep shade, the moss had taken root and was growing as if\nit always had been there.  He had been able to cut and stick much\nlarger willow sprouts for his walls than I could, and in the wet black\nmould they didn't look as if they ever had wilted.  They were so fresh\nand green, no doubt they had taken root and were growing.  Where I had\na low bench under my tree, he had used a log; but he had hewed the top\nflat, and made a moss cover.  In each corner he had set a fern as high\nas my head.  On either side of the entrance he had planted a cluster of\ncardinal flower that was in full bloom, and around the walls in a few\nplaces thrifty bunches of Oswego tea and foxfire, that I would have\nwalked miles to secure for my wild garden under the Bartlett pear tree.\nIt was so beautiful it took my breath away.\n\n\"If the Queen's daughter doesn't like this,\" I said softly, \"she'll\nhave to go to Heaven before she finds anything better, for there can't\nbe another place on earth so pretty.\"\n\nIt was wonderful how the sound of my own voice gave me courage, even if\nit did seem a little strange.  So I hurried to the beech, knelt and\nslipped the letter in the box, and put back the bark and stone.  Laddie\nhad said that nothing could hurt me while I had the letter, so my\nprotection was gone as soon as it left my hands.\n\nThere was nothing but my feet to save me now.  I thanked goodness I was\na fine runner, and started for the pawpaw thicket.  Once there, I\npaused only one minute to see whether the way to the stream was clear,\nand while standing tense and gazing, I heard something.  For an instant\nit was every bit as bad as at the dry creek.  Then I realized that this\nwas a soft voice singing, and I forgot everything else in a glow of\ndelight.  The Princess was coming!\n\nNever in all my life was I so surprised, and astonished, and\nbewildered.  She was even larger than our Sally; her dress was pale\ngreen, like I thought a Fairy's should be; her eyes were deep and dark\nas Laddie had said, her hair hung from a part in the middle of her\nforehead over her shoulders, and if she had been in the sun, it would\nhave gleamed like a blackbird's wing.  She was just as Laddie said she\nwould be; she was so much more beautiful than you would suppose any\nwoman could be, I stood there dumbly staring.  I wouldn't have asked\nfor any one more perfectly beautiful or more like Laddie had said the\nPrincess would be; but she was no more the daughter of the Fairy Queen\nthan I was.  She was not any more of a Princess.  If father ever would\ntell all about the little bauble he kept in the till of his big chest,\nmaybe she was not as near!  She was no one on earth but one of those\nnew English people who had moved on the land that cornered with ours on\nthe northwest.  She had ridden over the roads, and been at our meeting\nhouse.  There could be no mistake.\n\nAnd neither father nor mother would want her on our place.  They didn't\nlike her family at all.  Mother called them the neighbourhood mystery,\nand father spoke of them as the Infidels.  They had dropped from\nnowhere, mother said, bought that splendid big farm, moved on and shut\nout every one.  Before any one knew people were shut out, mother,\ndressed in her finest, with Laddie driving, went in the carriage, all\nshining, to make friends with them.  This very girl opened the door and\nsaid that her mother was \"indisposed,\" and could not see callers.\n\"In-dis-posed!\" That's a good word that fills your mouth, but our\nmother didn't like having it used to her.  She said the \"saucy chit\"\nwas insulting.  Then the man came, and he said he was very sorry, but\nhis wife would see no one.  He did invite mother in, but she wouldn't\ngo.  She told us she could see past him into the house and there was\nsuch finery as never in all her days had she laid eyes on.  She said he\nwas mannerly as could be, but he had the coldest, severest face she\never saw.\n\nThey had two men and a woman servant, and no one could coax a word from\nthem, about why those people acted as they did.  They said 'orse, and\n'ouse, and Hengland.  They talked so funny you couldn't have understood\nthem anyway.  They never plowed or put in a crop.  They made everything\ninto a meadow and had more horses, cattle, and sheep than a county\nfair, and everything you ever knew with feathers, even peacocks.  We\ncould hear them scream whenever it was going to rain.  Father said they\nsounded heathenish.  I rather liked them.  The man had stacks of money\nor they couldn't have lived the way they did.  He came to our house\ntwice on business: once to see about road laws, and again about tax\nrates.  Father was mightily pleased at first, because Mr. Pryor seemed\nto have books, and to know everything, and father thought it would be\nfine to be neighbours.  But the minute Mr. Pryor finished business he\nbegan to argue that every single thing father and mother believed was\nwrong.  He said right out in plain English that God was a myth.  Father\ntold him pretty quickly that no man could say that in his house; so he\nleft suddenly and had not been back since, and father didn't want him\never to come again.\n\nThen their neighbours often saw the woman around the house and garden.\nShe looked and acted quite as well as any one, so probably she was not\nhalf so sick as my mother, who had nursed three of us through typhoid\nfever, and then had it herself when she was all tired out.  She\nwouldn't let a soul know she had a pain until she dropped over and\ncouldn't take another step, and father or Laddie carried her to bed.\nBut she went everywhere, saw all her friends, and did more good from\nher bed than any other woman in our neighbourhood could on her feet.\nSo we thought mighty little of those Pryor people.\n\nEvery one said the girl was pretty.  Then her clothes drove the other\nwomen crazy.  Some of our neighbourhood came from far down east, like\nmy mother.  Our people back a little were from over the sea, and they\nknew how things should be, to be right.  Many of the others were from\nKentucky and Virginia, and they were well dressed, proud, handsome\nwomen; none better looking anywhere.  They followed the fashions and\nspent much time and money on their clothes.  When it was Quarterly\nMeeting or the Bishop dedicated the church or they went to town on\ncourt days, you should have seen them--until Pryors came.  Then\nsomething new happened, and not a woman in our neighbourhood liked it.\nPamela Pryor didn't follow the fashions.  She set them.  If every other\nwoman made long tight sleeves to their wrists, she let hers flow to the\nelbow and filled them with silk lining, ruffled with lace.  If they\nwore high neckbands, she had none, and used a flat lace collar.  If\nthey cut their waists straight around and gathered their skirts on six\nyards full, she ran hers down to a little point front and back, that\nmade her look slenderer, and put only half as much goods in her skirt.\nMaybe Laddie rode as well as she could; he couldn't manage a horse any\nbetter, and aside from him there wasn't a man we knew who would have\ntried to ride some of the animals she did.\n\nIf she ever worked a stroke, no one knew it.  All day long she sat in\nthe parlour, the very best one, every day; or on benches under the\ntrees with embroidery frames or books, some of them fearful, big,\ndifficult looking ones, or rode over the country.  She rode in sunshine\nand she rode in storm, until you would think she couldn't see her way\nthrough her tangled black hair.  She rode through snow and in pouring\nrain, when she could have stayed out of it, if she had wanted to.  She\ndidn't seem to be afraid of anything on earth or in Heaven.  Every one\nthought she was like her father and didn't believe there was any God;\nso when she came among us at church or any public gathering, as she\nsometimes did, people were in no hurry to be friendly, while she looked\nstraight ahead and never spoke until she was spoken to, and then she\nwas precise and cold, I tell you.\n\nMen took off their hats, got out of the road when she came pounding\nalong, and stared after her like \"be-addled mummies,\" my mother said.\nBut that was all she, or any one else, could say.  The young fellows\nwere wild about her, and if they tried to sidle up to her in the hope\nthat they might lead her horse or get to hold her foot when she\nmounted, they always saw when they reached her, that she wasn't there.\n\nBut she was here!  I had seen her only a few times, but this was the\nPryor girl, just as sure as I would have known if it had been Sally.\nWhat dazed me was that she answered in every particular the description\nLaddie had given me of the Queen's daughter.  And worst of all, from\nthe day she first came among us, moving so proud and cold, blabbing old\nHannah Dover said she carried herself like a Princess--as if Hannah\nDover knew HOW a Princess carried herself!--every living soul, my\nfather even, had called her the Princess.  At first it was because she\nwas like they thought a Princess would be, but later they did it in\nmeanness, to make fun.  After they knew her name, they were used to\ncalling her the Princess, so they kept it up, but some of them were\nsecretly proud of her; because she could look, and do, and be what they\nwould have given anything to, and knew they couldn't to save them.\n\nI was never in such a fix in all my life.  She looked more as Laddie\nhad said the Princess would than you would have thought any woman\ncould, but she was Pamela Pryor, nevertheless.  Every one called her\nthe Princess, but she couldn't make reality out of that.  She just\ncouldn't be the Fairy Queen's daughter; so the letter couldn't possibly\nbe for her.\n\nShe had no business in our woods; you could see that they had plenty of\ntheir own.  She went straight to the door of the willow room and walked\nin as if she belonged there.  What if she found the hollow and took\nLaddie's letter!  Fast as I could slip over the leaves, I went back.\nShe was on the moss carpet, on her knees, and the letter was in her\nfingers.  It's a good thing to have your manners soundly thrashed into\nyou.  You've got to be scared stiff before you forget them.  I wasn't\nso afraid of her as I would have been if I had known she WAS the\nprincess, and have Laddies letter, she should not.  What had the kind\nof girl she was, from a home like hers, to teach any one from our house\nabout making sunshine?  I was at the willow wall by that time peering\nthrough, so I just parted it a little and said:  \"Please put back that\nletter where you got it.  It isn't for you.\"\n\nShe knelt on the mosses, the letter in her hand, and her face, as she\nturned to me, was rather startled; but when she saw me she laughed, and\nsaid in the sweetest voice I ever heard:  \"Are you so very sure of\nthat?\"\n\n\"Well I ought to be,\" I said.  \"I put it there.\"\n\n\"Might I inquire for whom you put it there?\"\n\n\"No ma'am!  That's a secret.\"\n\nYou should have seen the light flame in her eyes, the red deepen on her\ncheeks, and the little curl of laughter that curved her lips.\n\n\"How interesting!\" she cried.  \"I wonder now if you are not Little\nSister.\"\n\n\"I am to Laddie and our folks,\" I said.  \"You are a stranger.\"\n\nAll the dancing lights went from her face.  She looked as if she were\ngoing to cry unless she hurried up and swallowed it down hard and fast.\n\n\"That is quite true,\" she said.  \"I am a stranger.  Do you know that\nbeing a stranger is the hardest thing that can happen to any one in all\nthis world?\"\n\n\"Then why don't you open your doors, invite your neighbours in, go to\nsee them, and stop your father from saying such dreadful things?\"\n\n\"They are not my doors,\" she said, \"and could you keep your father from\nsaying anything he chooses?\"\n\nI stood and blinked at her.  Of course I wouldn't even dare try that.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" was all I could think to say.\n\nI couldn't ask her to come to our house.  I knew no one wanted her.\nBut if I couldn't speak for the others, surely I might for myself.  I\nlet go the willows and went to the door.  The Princess arose and sat on\nthe seat Laddie had made for the Queen's daughter.  It was an awful\npity to tell her she shouldn't sit there, for I had my doubts if the\nreal, true Princess would be half as lovely when she came--if she ever\ndid.  Some way the Princess, who was not a Princess, appeared so real,\nI couldn't keep from becoming confused and forgetting that she was only\njust Pamela Pryor.  Already the lovely lights had gone from her face\nuntil it made me so sad I wanted to cry, and I was no easy cry-baby\neither.  If I couldn't offer friendship for my family I would for\nmyself.\n\n\"You may call me Little Sister, if you like,\" I said.  \"I won't be a\nstranger.\"\n\n\"Why how lovely!\" cried the Princess.\n\nYou should have seen the dancing lights fly back to her eyes.  Probably\nyou won't believe this, but the first thing I knew I was beside her on\nthe throne, her arm was around me, and it's the gospel truth that she\nhugged me tight.  I just had sense enough to reach over and pick\nLaddie's letter from her fingers, and then I was on her side.  I don't\nknow what she did to me, but all at once I knew that she was dreadfully\nlonely; that she hated being a stranger; that she was sorry enough to\ncry because their house was one of mystery, and that she would open the\ndoor if she could.\n\n\"I like you,\" I said, reaching up to touch her curls.\n\nI never had seen her that I did not want to.  They were like I thought\nthey would be.  Father and Laddie and some of us had wavy hair, but\nhers was crisp--and it clung to your fingers, and wrapped around them\nand seemed to tug at your heart like it does when a baby grips you.  I\ndrew away my hand, and the hair stretched out until it was long as any\nof ours, and then curled up again, and you could see that no tins had\nstabbed into her head to make those curls.  I began trying to single\nout one hair.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" she asked.\n\n\"I want to know if only one hair is strong enough to draw a drowning\nman from the water or strangle an unhappy one,\" I said.\n\n\"Believe me, no!\" cried the Princess.  \"It would take all I have, woven\ninto a rope, to do that.\"\n\n\"Laddie knows curls that just one hair of them is strong enough,\" I\nboasted.\n\n\"I wonder now!\" said the Princess.  \"I think he must have been making\npoetry or telling Fairy tales.\"\n\n\"He was telling the truth,\" I assured her.  \"Father doesn't believe in\nFairies, and mother laughs, but Laddie and I know.  Do you believe in\nFairies?\"\n\n\"Of course I do!\" she said.\n\n\"Then you know that this COULD be an Enchanted Wood?\"\n\n\"I have found it so,\" said the Princess.\n\n\"And MAYBE this is a Magic Carpet?\"\n\n\"It surely is a Magic Carpet.\"\n\n\"And you might be the daughter of the Queen?  Your eyes are 'moonlit\npools of darkness.'  If only your hair were stronger, and you knew\nabout making sunshine!\"\n\n\"Maybe it is stronger than I think.  It never has been tested.  Perhaps\nI do know about making sunshine.  Possibly I am as true as the wood and\nthe carpet.\"\n\nI drew away and stared at her.  The longer I looked the more uncertain\nI became.  Maybe her mother was the Queen.  Perhaps that was the\nmystery.  It might be the reason she didn't want the people to see her.\nMaybe she was so busy making sunshine for the Princess to bring to\nLaddie that she had no time to sew carpet rags, and to go to quiltings,\nand funerals, and make visits.  It was hard to know what to think.\n\n\"I wish you'd tell me plain out if you are the Queen's daughter,\" I\nsaid.  \"It's most important.  You can't have this letter unless I KNOW.\nIt's the very first time Laddie ever trusted me with a letter, and I\njust can't give it to the wrong person.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you leave it where he told you?\"\n\n\"But you have gone and found the place.  You started to take it once;\nyou would again, soon as I left.\"\n\n\"Look me straight in the eyes, Little Sister,\" said the Princess\nsoftly.  \"Am I like a person who would take anything that didn't belong\nto her?\"\n\n\"No!\" I said instantly.\n\n\"How do you think I happened to come to this place?\"\n\n\"Maybe our woods are prettier than yours.\"\n\n\"How do you think I knew where the letter was?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"If I show you some others exactly like the one you have there, then\nwill you believe that is for me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\n\nI believed it anyway.  It just SEEMED so, the better you knew her.  The\nPrincess slipped her hand among the folds of the trailing pale green\nskirt, and from a hidden pocket drew other letters exactly like the one\nI held.  She opened one and ran her finger along the top line and I\nread, \"To the Princess,\" and then she pointed to the ending and it was\nmerely signed, \"Laddie,\" but all the words written between were his\nwriting.  Slowly I handed her the letter.\n\n\"You don't want me to have it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.  \"I want you to have it if Laddie wrote it for you--but\nmother and father won't, not at all.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\" she asked gently.\n\n\"Don't you know what people say about you?\"\n\n\"Some of it, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Do you think it is true?\"\n\n\"Not that you're stuck up, and hateful and proud, not that you don't\nwant to be neighbourly with other people, no, I don't think that.  But\nyour father said in our home that there was no God, and you wouldn't\nlet my mother in when she put on her best dress and went in the\ncarriage, and wanted to be friends.  I have to believe that.\"\n\n\"Yes, you can't help believing that,\" said the Princess.\n\n\"Then can't you see why you'll be likely to show Laddie the way to find\ntrouble, instead of sunshine?\"\n\n\"I can see,\" said the Princess.\n\n\"Oh Princess, you won't do it, will you?\" I cried.\n\n\"Don't you think such a big man as Laddie can take care of himself?\"\nshe asked, and the dancing lights that had begun to fade came back.\n\"Over there,\" she pointed through our woods toward the southwest,\n\"lives a man you know.  What do his neighbours call him?\"\n\n\"Stiff-necked Johnny,\" I answered promptly.\n\n\"And the man who lives next him?\"\n\n\"Pinch-fist Williams.\"\n\nHer finger veered to another neighbour's.\n\n\"The girls of that house?\"\n\n\"Giggle-head Smithsons.\"\n\n\"What about the man who lives over there?\"\n\n\"He beats his wife.\"\n\n\"And the house beyond?\"\n\n\"Mother whispers about them.  I don't know.\"\n\n\"And the woman on the hill?\"\n\n\"She doesn't do anything but gussip and make every one trouble.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" said the Princess.  \"Yet most of these people come to your\nhouse, and your family goes to theirs.  Do you suppose people they know\nnothing about are so much worse than these others?\"\n\n\"If your father will take it back about God, and your mother will let\npeople in--my mother and father both wanted to be friends, you know.\"\n\n\"That I can't possibly do,\" she said, \"but maybe I could change their\nfeelings toward me.\"\n\n\"Do it!\" I cried.  \"Oh, I'd just love you to do it!  I wish you would\ncome to our house and be friends.  Sally is pretty as you are, only a\ndifferent way, and I know she'd like you, and so would Shelley.  If\nLaddie writes you letters and comes here about sunshine, of course he'd\nbe delighted if mother knew you; because she loves him best of any of\nus.  She depends on him most as much as father.\"\n\n\"Then will you keep the secret until I have time to try--say until this\ntime next year?\"\n\n\"I'll keep it just as long as Laddie wants me to.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the Princess.  \"No wonder Laddie thinks you the finest\nLittle Sister any one ever had.\"\n\n\"Does Laddie think that?\" I asked\n\n\"He does indeed!\" said the Princess.\n\n\"Then I'm not afraid to go home,\" I said.  \"And I'll bring his letter\nthe next time he can't come.\"\n\n\"Were you scared this time?\"\n\nI told her about that Something in the dry bed, the wolves, wildcats,\nPaddy Ryan, and the Gypsies.\n\n\"You little goosie,\" said the Princess.  \"I am afraid that brother Leon\nof yours is the biggest rogue loose in this part of the country.\nDidn't it ever occur to you that people named Wolfe live over there,\nand they call that crowd next us 'wildcats,' because they just went on\nsome land and took it, and began living there without any more\npermission than real wildcats ask to enter the woods?  Do you suppose I\nwould be here, and everywhere else I want to go, if there were any\ndanger?  Did anything really harm you coming?\"\n\n\"You're harmed when you're scared until you can't breathe,\" I said.\n\"Anyway, nothing could get me coming, because I held the letter tight\nin my hand, like Laddie said.  If you'd write me one to take back, I'd\nbe safe going home.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the Princess.  \"But I've no pencil, and no paper, unless\nI use the back of one of Laddie's letters, and that wouldn't be polite.\"\n\n\"You can make new fashions,\" I said, \"but you don't know much about the\nwoods, do you?  I could fix fifty ways to send a message to Laddie.\"\n\n\"How would you?\" asked the Princess.\n\nRunning to the pawpaw bushes I pulled some big tender leaves.  Then I\ntook the bark from the box and laid a leaf on it.\n\n\"Press with one of your rings,\" I said, \"and print what you want to\nsay.  I write to the Fairies every day that way, only I use an old\nknife handle.\"\n\nShe tried.  She spoiled two or three by bearing down so hard she cut\nthe leaves.  She didn't even know enough to write on the frosty side,\nuntil she was told.  But pretty soon she got along so well she printed\nall over two big ones.  Then I took a stick and punched little holes\nand stuck a piece of foxfire bloom through.\n\n\"What makes you do that?\" she asked.\n\n\"That's the stamp,\" I explained.\n\n\"But it's my letter, and I didn't put it there.\"\n\n\"Has to be there or the Fairies won't like it,\" I said.\n\n\"Well then, let it go,\" said the Princess.\n\nI put back the bark and replaced the stone, gathered up the scattered\nleaves, and put the two with writing on between fresh ones.\n\n\"Now I must run,\" I said, \"or Laddie will think the Gypsies have got me\nsure.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you past the dry creek,\" she offered.\n\n\"You better not,\" I said.  \"I'd love to have you, but it would be best\nfor you to change their opinion, before father or mother sees you on\ntheir land.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would,\" said the Princess.  \"I'll wait here until you reach\nthe fence and then you call and I'll know you are in the open and feel\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"I am most all over being afraid now,\" I told her.\n\nJust to show her, I walked to the creek, climbed the gate and went down\nthe lane.  Almost to the road I began wondering what I could do with\nthe letter, when looking ahead I saw Laddie coming.\n\n\"I was just starting to find you.  You've been an age, child,\" he said.\n\nI held up the letter.\n\n\"No one is looking,\" I said, \"and this won't go in your pocket.\"\n\nYou should have seen his face.\n\n\"Where did you get it?\" he asked.\n\nI told him all about it.  I told him everything--about the hair that\nmaybe was stronger than she thought, and that she was going to change\nfather's and mother's opinions, and that I put the red flower on, but\nshe left it; and when I was done Laddie almost hugged the life out of\nme.  I never did see him so happy.\n\n\"If you be very, very careful never to breathe a whisper, I'll take you\nwith me some day,\" he promised.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOur Angel Boy\n\n  \"I had a brother once--a gracious boy,\n  Full of all gentleness, of calmest hope,\n  Of sweet and quiet joy,--there was the look\n  Of heaven upon his face.\"\n\n\nIt was supper time when we reached home, and Bobby was at the front\ngate to meet me.  He always hunted me all over the place when the big\nbell in the yard rang at meal time, because if he crowed nicely when he\nwas told, he was allowed to stand on the back of my chair and every\nlittle while I held up my plate and shared bites with him.  I have seen\nmany white bantams, but never another like Bobby.  My big brothers\nbought him for me in Fort Wayne, and sent him in a box, alone on the\ncars.  Father and I drove to Groveville to meet him.  The minute father\npried off the lid, Bobby hopped on the edge of the box and crowed--the\nbiggest crow you ever heard from such a mite of a body; he wasn't in\nthe least afraid of us and we were pleased about it.  You scarcely\ncould see his beady black eyes for his bushy topknot, his wing tips\ntouched the ground, his tail had two beautiful plumy feathers much\nlonger than the others, his feet were covered with feathers, and his\nknee tufts dragged.  He was the sauciest, spunkiest little fellow, and\nwhite as muslin.  We went to supper together, but no one asked where I\nhad been, and because I was so bursting full of importance, I talked\nonly to Bobby, in order to be safe.\n\nAfter supper I finished Hezekiah's trousers, and May cut his coat for\nme.  School would begin in September and our clothes were being made,\nso I used the scraps to dress him.  His suit was done by the next\nforenoon, and father never laughed harder than when Hezekiah hopped\ndown the walk to meet him dressed in pink trousers and coat.  The coat\nhad flowing sleeves like the Princess wore, so Hezekiah could fly, and\nhe seemed to like them.\n\nHis suit was such a success I began a sunbonnet, and when that was tied\non him, the folks almost had spasms.  They said he wouldn't like being\ndressed; that he would fly away to punish me, but he did no such thing.\nHe stayed around the house and was tame as ever.\n\nWhen I became tired sewing that afternoon, I went down the lane leading\nto our meadow, where Leon was killing thistles with a grubbing hoe.  I\nthought he would be glad to see me, and he was.  Every one had been\nbusy in the house, so I went to the cellar the outside way and ate all\nI wanted from the cupboard.  Then I spread two big slices of bread the\nbest I could with my fingers, putting apple butter on one, and mashed\npotatoes on the other.  Leon leaned on the hoe and watched me coming.\nHe was a hungry boy, and lonesome too, but he couldn't be forced to say\nso.\n\n\"Laddie is at work in the barn,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm going to play in the creek,\" I answered.\n\nCrossing our meadow there was a stream that had grassy banks, big\ntrees, willows, bushes and vines for shade, a solid pebbly bed; it was\nall turns and bends so that the water hurried until it bubbled and sang\nas it went; in it lived tiny fish coloured brightly as flowers, beside\nit ran killdeer, plover and solemn blue herons almost as tall as I was\ncame from the river to fish; for a place to play on an August\nafternoon, it couldn't be beaten.  The sheep had been put in the lower\npasture; so the cross old Shropshire ram was not there to bother us.\n\n\"Come to the shade,\" I said to Leon, and when we were comfortably\nseated under a big maple weighted down with trailing grapevines, I\noffered the bread.  Leon took a piece in each hand and began to eat as\nif he were starving.  Laddie would have kissed me and said:  \"What a\nfine treat!  Thank you, Little Sister.\"\n\nLeon was different.  He ate so greedily you had to know he was glad to\nget it, but he wouldn't say so, not if he never got any more.  When you\nknew him, you understood he wouldn't forget it, and he'd be certain to\ndo something nice for you before the day was over to pay back.  We sat\nthere talking about everything we saw, and at last Leon said with a\ngrin:  \"Shelley isn't getting much grape sap is she?\"\n\n\"I didn't know she wanted grape sap.\"\n\n\"She read about it in a paper.  It said to cut the vine of a wild\ngrape, catch the drippings and moisten your hair.  This would make it\nglossy and grow faster.\"\n\n\"What on earth does Shelley want with more hair than she has?\"\n\n\"Oh, she has heard it bragged on so much she thinks people would say\nmore if she could improve it.\"\n\nI looked and there was the vine, dry as could be, and a milk crock\nbeneath it.\n\n\"Didn't the silly know she had to cut the vine in the spring when the\nsap was running?\"\n\n\"Bear witness, O vine! that she did not,\" said Leon, \"and speak, ye\nvoiceless pottery, and testify that she expected to find you\noverflowing.\"\n\n\"Too bad that she's going to be disappointed.\"\n\n\"She isn't!  She's going to find ample liquid to bathe her streaming\ntresses.  Keep quiet and watch me.\"\n\nHe picked up the crock, carried it to the creek and dipped it full of\nwater.\n\n\"That's too much,\" I objected.  \"She'll know she never got a crock full\nfrom a dry vine.\"\n\n\"She'll think the vine bled itself dry for her sake.\"\n\n\"She isn't that silly.\"\n\n\"Well then, how silly is she?\" asked Leon, spilling out half.  \"About\nso?\"\n\n\"Not so bad as that.  Less yet!\"\n\n\"Anything to please the ladies,\" said Leon, pouring out more.  Then we\nsat and giggled a while.\n\n\"What are you going to do now?\" asked Leon.\n\n\"Play in the creek,\" I answered.\n\n\"All right!  I'll work near you.\"\n\nHe rolled his trousers above his knees and took the hoe, but he was in\nthe water most of the time.  We had to climb on the bank when we came\nto the deep curve, under the stump of the old oak that father cut\nbecause Pete Billings would climb it and yowl like a wildcat on cold\nwinter nights.  Pete was wrong in his head like Paddy Ryan, only worse.\nAs we passed we heard the faintest sounds, so we lay and looked, and\nthere in the dark place under the roots, where the water was deepest,\nhuddled some of the cunningest little downy wild ducks you ever saw.\nWe looked at each other and never said a word.  Leon chased them out\nwith the hoe and they swam down stream faster than old ones.  I stood\nin the shallow water behind them and kept them from going back to the\ndeep place, while Leon worked to catch them.  Every time he got one he\nbrought it to me, and I made a bag of my apron front to put them in.\nThe supper bell rang before we caught all of them.  We were dripping\nwet with creek water and perspiration, but we had the ducks, every one\nof them, and proudly started home.  I'll wager Leon was sorry he didn't\nwear aprons so he could carry them.  He did keep the last one in his\nhands, and held its little fluffy body against his cheeks every few\nminutes.\n\n\"Couldn't anything be prettier than a young duck.\"\n\n\"Except a little guinea,\" I said.\n\n\"That's so!\" said Leon.  \"They are most as pretty as quail.  I guess\nall young things that have down are about as cunning as they can be.  I\ndon't believe I know which I like best, myself.\"\n\n\"Baby killdeers.\"\n\n\"I mean tame.  Things we raise.\"\n\n\"I'll take guineas.\"\n\n\"I'll say white turkeys.  They seem so innocent.  Nothing of ours is\npretty as these.\"\n\n\"But these are wild.\"\n\n\"So they are,\" said Leon.  \"Twelve of them.  Won't mother be pleased?\"\n\nShe was not in the least.  She said we were a sight to behold; that she\nwas ashamed to be the mother of two children who didn't know tame ducks\nfrom wild ones.  She remembered instantly that Amanda Deam had set a\nspeckled Dorking hen on Mallard duck eggs, where she got the eggs, and\nwhat she paid for them.  She said the ducks had found the creek that\nflowed beside Deams' barnyard before it entered our land, and they had\nswum away from the hen, and both the hen and Amanda would be frantic.\nShe put the ducks into a basket and said to take them back soon as ever\nwe got our suppers, and we must hurry because we had to bathe and learn\nour texts for Sunday-school in the morning.\n\nWe went through the orchard, down the hill and across the meadow until\nwe came to the creek.  By that time we were tired of the basket.  It\nwas one father had woven himself of shaved and soaked hickory strips,\nand it was heavy.  The sight of water suggested the proper place for\nducks, anyway.  We talked it over and decided that they would be much\nmore comfortable swimming than in the basket, and it was more fun to\nwade than to walk, so we went above the deep place, I stood in the\ncreek to keep them from going down, and Leon poured them on the water.\nPigs couldn't have acted more contrary.  Those ducks LIKED us.  They\nwouldn't go to Deams'.  They just fought to swim back to us.  Anyway,\nwe had the worst time you ever saw.  Leon cut long switches to herd\nthem with, and both of us waded and tried to drive them, but they would\ndart under embankments and roots, and dive and hide.\n\nBefore we reached the Deams' I wished that we had carried them as\nmother told us, for we had lost three, and if we stopped to hunt them,\nmore would hide.  By the time we drove them under the floodgate\ncrossing the creek between our land and the Deams' four were gone.\nLeon left me on the gate with both switches to keep them from going\nback and he ran to call Mrs. Deam.  She had red hair and a hot temper,\nand we were not very anxious to see her, but we had to do it.  While\nLeon was gone I was thinking pretty fast and I knew exactly how things\nwould happen.  First time mother saw Mrs. Deam she would ask her if the\nducks were all right, and she would tell that four were gone.  Mother\nwould ask how many she had, and she would say twelve, then mother would\nremember that she started us with twelve in the basket--Oh what's the\nuse!  Something had to be done.  It had to be done quickly too, for I\ncould hear Amanda Deam, her boy Sammy and Leon coming across the\nbarnyard.  I looked around in despair, but when things are the very\nworst, there is almost always some way out.\n\nOn the dry straw worked between and pushing against the panels of the\nfloodgate, not far from me, I saw a big black water snake.  I took one\ngood look at it: no coppery head, no geometry patterns, no rattlebox,\nso I knew it wasn't poisonous and wouldn't bite until it was hurt, and\nif it did, all you had to do was to suck the place, and it wouldn't\namount to more than two little pricks as if pins had stuck you; but a\nbig snake was a good excuse.  I rolled from the floodgate among the\nducks, and cried, \"Snake!\" They scattered everywhere.  The snake lazily\nuncoiled and slid across the straw so slowly that--thank goodness!\nAmanda Deam got a fair look at it.  She immediately began to jump up\nand down and scream.  Leon grabbed a stick and came running to the\nwater.  I cried so he had to help me out first.\n\n\"Don't let her count them!\" I whispered.\n\nLeon gave me one swift look and all the mischief in his blue eyes\npeeped out.  He was the funniest boy you ever knew, anyway.  Mostly he\nlooked scowly and abused.  He had a grievance against everybody and\neverything.  He said none of us liked him, and we imposed on him.\nFather said that if he tanned Leon's jacket for anything, and set him\ndown to think it over, he would pout a while, then he would look\nthoughtful, suddenly his face would light up and he would go away\nsparkling; and you could depend upon it he would do the same thing\nover, or something worse, inside an hour.  When he wanted to, he could\nsmile the most winning smile, and he could coax you into anything.\nMother said she dreaded to have to borrow a dime from him, if a peddler\ncaught her without change, because she knew she'd be kept paying it\nback for the next six months.  Right now he was the busiest kind of a\nboy.\n\n\"Where is it?  Let me get a good lick at it!  Don't scare the ducks!\"\nhe would cry, and chase them from one bank to the other, while Amanda\ndanced and fought imaginary snakes.  For a woman who had seen as many\nas she must have in her life, it was too funny.  I don't think I could\nlaugh harder, or Leon and Sammy.  We enjoyed ourselves so much that at\nlast she began to be angry.  She quit dancing, and commenced hunting\nducks, for sure.  She held her skirts high, poked along the banks,\njumped the creek and didn't always get clear across.  Her hair shook\ndown, she lost a sidecomb, and she couldn't find half the ducks.\n\n\"You younguns pack right out of here,\" she said.  \"Me and Sammy can get\nthem better ourselves, and if we don't find all of them, we'll know\nwhere they are.\"\n\n\"We haven't got any of your ducks,\" I said angrily, but Leon smiled his\nmost angelic smile, and it seemed as if he were going to cry.\n\n\"Of course, if you want to accuse mother of stealing your ducks, you\ncan,\" he said plaintively, \"but I should think you'd be ashamed to do\nit, after all the trouble we took to catch them before they swam to the\nriver, where you never would have found one of them.  Come on, Little\nSister, let's go home.\"\n\nHe started and I followed.  As soon as we got around the bend we sat on\nthe bank, hung our feet in the water, leaned against each other and\nlaughed.  We just laughed ourselves almost sick.  When Amanda's face\ngot fire red, and her hair came down, and she jumped and didn't go\nquite over, she looked a perfect fright.\n\n\"Will she ever find all of them?\" I asked at last.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Leon.  \"She will comb the grass and strain the water\nuntil she gets every one.\"\n\n\"Hoo-hoo!\"\n\nI looked at Leon.  He was so intently watching an old turkey buzzard\nhanging in the air, he never heard the call that meant it was time for\nus to be home and cleaning up for Sunday.  It was difficult to hurry,\nfor after we had been soaped and scoured, we had to sit on the back\nsteps and commit to memory verses from the Bible.  At last we waded\ntoward home.  Two of the ducks we had lost swam before us all the way,\nso we knew they were alive, and all they needed was finding.\n\n\"If she hadn't accused mother of stealing her old ducks, I'd catch\nthose and carry them back to her,\" said Leon.  \"But since she thinks we\nare so mean, I'll just let her and little Sammy find them.\"\n\nThen we heard their voices as they came down the creek, so Leon reached\nme his hand and we scampered across the water and meadow, never\nstopping until we sat on the top rail of our back orchard fence.  There\nwe heard another call, but that was only two.  We sat there, rested and\nlooked at the green apples above our heads, wishing they were ripe, and\ntalking about the ducks.  We could see Mrs. Deam and Sammy coming down\nthe creek, one on each side.  We slid from the fence and ran into a\nqueer hollow that was cut into the hill between the never-fail and the\nBaldwin apple trees.\n\nThat hollow was overgrown with weeds, and full of trimmings from trees,\nstumps, everything that no one wanted any place else in the orchard.\nIt was the only unkept spot on our land, and I always wondered why\nfather didn't clean it out and make it look respectable.  I said so to\nLeon as we crouched there watching down the hill where Mrs. Deam and\nSammy hunted ducks with not such very grand success.  They seemed to\nhave so many they couldn't decide whether to go back or go on, so they\nmust have found most of them.\n\n\"You know I've always had my suspicions about this place,\" said Leon.\n\"There is somewhere on our land that people can be hidden for a long\ntime.  I can remember well enough before the war ever so long, and\nwhile it was going worst, we would find the wagon covered with more mud\nin the morning than had been on it at night; and the horses would be\nsplashed and tired.  Once I was awake in the night and heard voices.\nIt made me want a drink, so I went downstairs for it, and ran right\ninto the biggest, blackest man who ever grew.  If father and mother\nhadn't been there I'd have been scared into fits.  Next morning he was\ngone and there wasn't a whisper.  Father said I'd had bad dreams.  That\nnight the horses made another mysterious trip.  Now where did they keep\nthe black man all that day?\"\n\n\"What did they have a black man for?\"\n\n\"They were helping him run away from slavery to be free in Canada.  It\nwas all right.  I'd have done the same thing.  They helped a lot.\nFather was a friend of the Governor.  There were letters from him, and\nthere was some good reason why father stayed at home, when he was crazy\nabout the war.  I think this farm was what they called an Underground\nStation.  What I want to know is where the station was.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's here.  Let's hunt,\" I said.  \"If the black men were here\nsome time, they would have to be fed, and this is not far from the\nhouse.\"\n\nSo we took long sticks and began poking into the weeds.  Then we moved\nthe brush, and sure as you live, we found an old door with a big stone\nagainst it.  I looked at Leon and he looked at me.\n\n\"Hoo-hoo!\" came mother's voice, and that was the third call.\n\n\"Hum!  Must be for us,\" said Leon.  \"We better go as soon as we get a\nlittle dryer.\"\n\nHe slid down the bank on one side, and I on the other, and we pushed at\nthe stone.  I thought we never would get it rolled away so we could\nopen the door a crack, but when we did what we saw was most surprising.\nThere was a little room, dreadfully small, but a room.  There was\nstraw scattered over the floor, very deep on one side, where an old\nblanket showed that it had been a bed.  Across the end there was a\nshelf.  On it was a candlestick, with a half-burned candle in it, a pie\npan with some mouldy crumbs, crusts, bones in it, and a tin can.  Leon\npicked up the can and looked in.  I could see too.\n\nIt had been used for water or coffee, as the plate had for food, once,\nbut now it was stuffed full of money.  I saw Leon pull some out and\nthen shove it back, and he came to the door white as could be, shut it\nbehind him and began to push at the stone.  When we got it in place we\nput the brush over it, and fixed everything like it had been.\n\nAt last Leon said:  \"That's the time we got into something not intended\nfor us, and if father finds it out, we are in for a good thrashing.\nAre you just a blubbering baby, or are you big enough to keep still?\"\n\n\"I am old enough that I could have gone to school two years ago, and I\nwon't tell!\" I said stoutly.\n\n\"All right!  Come on then,\" said Leon.  \"I don't know but mother has\nbeen calling us.\"\n\nWe started up the orchard path at the fourth call.\n\n\"Hoo-hoo!\" answered Leon in a sick little voice to make it sound far\naway.  Must have made mother think we were on Deams' hill.  Then we\nwent on side by side.\n\n\"Say Leon, you found the Station, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Don't talk about it!\" snapped Leon.\n\nI changed the subject\n\n\"Whose money do you suppose that is?\"\n\n\"Oh crackey!  You can depend on a girl to see everything,\" groaned\nLeon.  \"Do you think you'll be able to stand the switching that job\nwill bring you, without getting sick in bed?\"\n\nNow I never had been sick in bed, and from what I had seen of other\npeople who were, I never wanted to be.  The idea of being switched\nuntil it made me sick was too much for me.  I shut my mouth tight and I\nnever opened it about the Station place.  As we reached the\nmaiden's-blush apple tree came another call, and it sounded pretty\ncross, I can tell you.  Leon reached his hand.\n\n\"Now, it's time to run.  Let me do the talking.\"\n\nWe were out of breath when we reached the back door.  There stood the\ntub on the kitchen floor, the boiler on the stove, soap, towels, and\nclean clothing on chairs.  Leon had his turn at having his ears washed\nfirst, because he could bathe himself while mother did my hair.\n\n\"Was Mrs. Deam glad to get her ducks back?\" she asked as she\nfine-combed Leon.\n\n\"Aw, you never can tell whether she's glad about anything or not,\"\ngrowled Leon.  \"You'd have thought from the way she acted, that we'd\nbeen trying to steal her ducks.  She said if she missed any she'd know\nwhere to find them.\"\n\n\"Well as I live!\" cried mother.  \"Why I wouldn't have believed that of\nAmanda Deam.  You told her you thought they were wild, of course.\"\n\n\"I didn't have a chance to tell her anything.  The minute the ducks\nstruck the water they started right back down stream, and there was a\nbig snake, and we had an awful time.  We got wet trying to head them\nback, and then we didn't find all of them.\"\n\n\"They are like little eels.  You should have helped Amanda.\"\n\n\"Well, you called so cross we thought you would come after us, so we\nhad to run.\"\n\n\"One never knows,\" sighed mother.  \"I thought you were loitering.  Of\ncourse if I had known you were having trouble with the ducks!  I think\nyou had better go back and help them.\"\n\n\"Didn't I do enough to take them home?  Can't Sammy Deam catch ducks as\nfast as I can?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said mother.  \"And I must get your bathing out of the\nway of supper.  You use the tub while I do Little Sister's hair.\"\n\nI almost hated Sunday, because of what had to be done to my hair on\nSaturday, to get ready for it.  All week it hung in two long braids\nthat were brushed and arranged each morning.  But on Saturday it had to\nbe combed with a fine comb, oiled and rolled around strips of tin until\nSunday morning.  Mother did everything thoroughly.  She raked that fine\ncomb over our scalps until she almost raised the blood.  She hadn't\ntime to fool with tangles, and we had so much hair she didn't know what\nto do with all of it, anyway.  When she was busy talking she reached\naround too far and combed across our foreheads or raked the tip of an\near.\n\nBut on Sunday morning we forgot all that, when we walked down the aisle\nwith shining curls hanging below our waists.  Mother was using the fine\ncomb, when she looked up, and there stood Mrs. Freshett.  We could see\nat a glance that she was out of breath.\n\n\"Have I beat them?\" she cried.\n\n\"Whom are you trying to beat?\" asked mother as she told May to set a\nchair for Mrs. Freshett and bring her a drink.\n\n\"The grave-kiver men,\" she said.  \"I wanted to get to you first.\"\n\n\"Well, you have,\" said mother.  \"Rest a while and then tell me.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Freshett was so excited she couldn't rest.\n\n\"I thought they were coming straight on down,\" she said, \"but they must\nhave turned off at the cross roads.  I want to do what's right by my\nchildren here or there,\" panted Mrs. Freshett, \"and these men seemed to\nthink the contrivance they was sellin' perfectly grand, an' like to be\nan aid to the soul's salvation.  Nice as it seemed, an' convincin' as\nthey talked, I couldn't get the consent of my mind to order, until I\nknowed if you was goin' to kiver your dead with the contraption.  None\nof the rest of the neighbours seem over friendly to me, an' I've told\nJosiah many's the time, that I didn't care a rap if they wa'n't, so\nlong as I had you.  Says I, 'Josiah, to my way of thinkin', she is top\ncrust in this neighbourhood, and I'm on the safe side apin' her ways\nclost as possible.'\"\n\n\"I'll gladly help you all I can,\" said my mother.\n\n\"Thanky!\" said Mrs. Freshett.  \"I knowed you would.  Josiah he says to\nme, 'Don't you be apin' nobody.'  'Josiah,' says I, 'it takes a pretty\nsmart woman in this world to realize what she doesn't know.  Now I know\nwhat I know, well enough, but all I know is like to keep me an' my\nchildren in a log cabin an' on log cabin ways to the end of our time.\nYou ain't even got the remains of the cabin you started in for a cow\nshed.'  Says I, 'Josiah, Miss Stanton knows how to get out of a cabin\nan' into a grand big palace, fit fur a queen woman.  She's a ridin' in\na shinin' kerridge, 'stid of a spring wagon.  She goes abroad dressed\nso's you men all stand starin' like cabbage heads.  All hern go to\nchurch, an' Sunday-school, an' college, an' come out on the top of the\nheap.  She does jest what I'd like to if I knowed how.  An' she ain't\ncome-uppety one morsel.'  If I was to strike acrost fields to them\nstuck-up Pryors, I'd get the door slammed in my face if 'twas the\nmissus, a sneer if 'twas the man, an' at best a nod cold as an iceberg\nif 'twas the girl.  Them as want to call her kind 'Princess,' and\nencourage her in being more stuck up 'an she was born to be, can, but\nto my mind a Princess is a person who thinks of some one besides\nherself once in a while.\"\n\n\"I don't find the Pryors easy to become acquainted with,\" said mother.\n\"I have never met the woman; I know the man very slightly; he has been\nhere on business once or twice, but the girl seems as if she would be\nnice, if one knew her.\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't have s'posed she was your kind,\" said Mrs. Freshett.\n\"If she is, I won't open my head against her any more.  Anyway, it was\nthe grave-kivers I come about.\"\n\n\"Just what is it, Mrs. Freshett?\" asked mother.\n\n\"It's two men sellin' a patent iron kiver for to protect the graves of\nyour dead from the sun an' the rain.\"\n\n\"Who wants the graves of their dead protected from the sun and the\nrain?\" demanded my mother sharply.\n\n\"I said to Josiah, 'I don't know how she'll feel about it, but I can't\ndo more than ask.'\"\n\n\"Do they carry a sample?  What is it like?\"\n\n\"Jest the len'th an' width of a grave.  They got from baby to\nsix-footer sizes.  They are cast iron like the bottom of a cook stove\non the under side, but atop they are polished so they shine somethin'\nbeautiful.  You can get them in a solid piece, or with a hole in the\ncentre about the size of a milk crock to set flowers through.  They\ncome ten to the grave, an' they are mighty stylish lookin' things.  I\nhave been savin' all I could skimp from butter, an' eggs, to get\nSamantha a organ; but says I to her:  'You are gettin' all I can do for\nyou every day; there lays your poor brother 'at ain't had a finger\nlifted for him since he was took so sudden he was gone before I knowed\nhe was goin'.'  I never can get over Henry bein' took the way he was,\nso I says: 'If this would be a nice thing to have for Henry's grave,\nand the neighbours are goin' to have them for theirn, looks to me like\nsome of the organ money will have to go, an' we'll make it up later.'\nI don't 'low for Henry to be slighted bekase he rid himself to death\ntrying to make a president out of his pa's gin'ral.\"\n\n\"You never told me how you lost your son,\" said mother, feeling so\nbadly she wiped one of my eyes full of oil.\n\n\"Law now, didn't I?\" inquired Mrs. Freshett.  \"Well mebby that is\nbekase I ain't had a chance to tell you much of anythin', your bein'\nalways so busy like, an' me not wantin' to wear out my welcome.  It was\nlike this:  All endurin' the war Henry an' me did the best we could\nwithout pa at home, but by the time it was over, Henry was most a man.\nSeemed as if when he got home, his pa was all tired out and glad to set\ndown an' rest, but Henry was afire to be up an' goin'.  His pa filled\nhim so full o' Grant, it was runnin' out of his ears.  Come the second\nrun the Gin'ral made, peered like Henry set out to 'lect him all by\nhisself.  He wore every horse on the place out, ridin' to rallies.\nSometimes he was gone three days at a stretch.  He'd git one place an'\nhear of a rally on ten miles or so furder, an' blest if he didn't ride\nplum acrost the state 'fore he got through with one trip.  He set out\nin July, and he rid right straight through to November, nigh onto every\nday of his life.  He got white, an' thin, an' narvous, from loss of\nsleep an' lack of food, an' his pa got restless, said Henry was takin'\nthe 'lection more serious 'an he ever took the war.  Last few days\nbefore votin' was cold an' raw an' Henry rid constant.  'Lection day he\ncouldn't vote, for he lacked a year of bein' o' age, an' he rid in with\na hard chill, an' white as a ghost, an' he says:  'Ma,' says he, 'I've\n'lected Grant, but I'm all tuckered out.  Put me to bed an' kiver me\nwarm.'\"\n\nI forgot the sting in my eyes watching Mrs. Freshett.  She was the\nlargest woman I knew, and strong as most men.  Her hair was black and\nglisteny, her eyes black, her cheeks red, her skin a clear, even dark\ntint.  She was handsome, she was honest, and she was in earnest over\neverything.  There was something about her, or her family, that had to\nbe told in whispers, and some of the neighbours would have nothing to\ndo with her.  But mother said Mrs. Freshett was doing the very best she\nknew, and for the sake of that, and of her children, anyone who\nwouldn't help her was not a Christian, and not to be a Christian was\nthe very worst thing that could happen to you.  I stared at her\nsteadily.  She talked straight along, so rapidly you scarcely could\nkeep up with the words; you couldn't if you wanted to think about them\nany between.  There was not a quiver in her voice, but from her eyes\nthere rolled, steadily, the biggest, roundest tears I ever saw.  They\nran down her cheeks, formed a stream in the first groove of her double\nchin, overflowed it, and dripped drop, drop, a drop at a time, on the\nbreast of her stiffly starched calico dress, and from there shot to her\nknees.\n\n\"'Twa'n't no time at all 'til he was chokin' an' burnin' red with\nfever, an' his pa and me, stout as we be, couldn't hold him down nor\nkeep him kivered.  He was speechifyin' to beat anythin' you ever heard.\nHis pa said he was repeatin' what he'd heard said by every big stump\nspeaker from Greeley to Logan.  When he got so hoarse we couldn't tell\nwhat he said any more, he jest mouthed it, an' at last he dropped back\nand laid like he was pinned to the sheets, an' I thought he was\nrestin', but 'twa'n't an hour 'til he was gone.\"\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Freshett lifted her apron, covered her face and sobbed\nuntil her broad shoulders shook.\n\n\"Oh you poor soul!\" said my mother.  \"I'm so sorry for you!\"\n\n\"I never knowed he was a-goin' until he was gone,\" she said.  \"He was\nthe only one of mine I ever lost, an' I thought it would jest lay me\nout.  I couldn't 'a' stood it at all if I hadn't 'a' knowed he was\nsaved.  I well know my Henry went straight to Heaven.  Why Miss\nStanton, he riz right up in bed at the last, and clear and strong he\njest yelled it:  'Hurrah fur Grant!'\"\n\nMy mother's fingers tightened in my hair until I thought she would pull\nout a lot, and I could feel her knees stiffen.  Leon just whooped.\nMother sprang up and ran to the door.\n\n\"Leon!\" she cried.  Then there was a slam.  \"What in the world is the\nmatter?\" she asked.\n\n\"Stepped out of the tub right on the soap, and it threw me down,\"\nexplained Leon.\n\n\"For mercy sake, be careful!\" said my mother, and shut the door.\n\nIt wasn't a minute before the knob turned and it opened again a little.\n\nI never saw mother's face look so queer, but at last she said softly:\n\"You were thinking of the grave cover for him?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I wanted to ask you before I bound myself.  I heard you lost\ntwo when the scarlet fever was ragin' an' I'm goin' to do jest what you\ndo.  If you have kivers, I will.  If you don't like them when you see\nhow bright and shiny they are, I won't get any either.\"\n\n\"I can tell you without seeing them, Mrs. Freshett,\" said my mother,\nwrapping a strand of hair around the tin so tight I slipped up my\nfingers to feel whether my neck wasn't like a buck-eye hull looks, and\nit was.  \"I don't want any cover for the graves of my dead but grass\nand flowers, and sky and clouds.  I like the rain to fall on them, and\nthe sun to shine, so that the grass and flowers will grow.  If you are\nsatisfied that the soul of Henry is safe in Heaven, that is all that is\nnecessary.  Laying a slab of iron on top of earth six feet above his\nbody will make no difference to him.  If he is singing with the angels,\nby all means save your money for the organ.\"\n\n\"I don't know about the singin', but I'd stake my last red cent he's\nstill hollerin' fur Grant.  I was kind o' took with the idea; the\nthings was so shiny and scilloped at the edges, peered like it was\npayin' considerable respect to the dead to kiver them that-a-way.\"\n\n\"What good would it do?\" asked mother.  \"The sun shining on the iron\nwould make it so hot it would burn any flower you tried to plant in the\nopening; the water couldn't reach the roots, and all that fell on the\nslab would run off and make it that much wetter at the edges.  The iron\nwould soon rust and grow dreadfully ugly lying under winter snow.\nThere is nothing at all in it, save a method to work on the feelings of\nthe living, and get them to pay their money for something that wouldn't\naffect their dead a particle.\"\n\n\"'Twould be a poor idea for me,\" said Mrs. Freshett.  \"I said to the\nmen that I wanted to honour Henry all I could, but with my bulk, I'd\nhev all I could do, come Jedgment Day, to bust my box, an' heave up the\nclods, without havin' to hist up a piece of iron an' klim from under\nit.\"\n\nMother stiffened and Leon slipped again.  He could have more accidents\nthan any boy I ever knew.  But it was only a few minutes until he came\nto mother and gave her a Bible to mark the verses he had to learn to\nrecite at Sunday-school next day.  Mother couldn't take the time when\nshe had company, so she asked if he weren't big enough to pick out ten\nproper verses and learn them by himself, and he said of course he was.\nHe took his Bible and he and May and I sat on the back steps and\nstudied our verses.  He and May were so big they had ten; but I had\nonly two, and mine were not very long.  Leon giggled half the time he\nwas studying.  I haven't found anything so very funny in the Bible.\nEvery few minutes he would whisper to himself:  \"THAT'S A GOOD ONE!\"\n\nHe took the book and heard May do hers until she had them perfectly,\nthen he went and sat on the back fence with his book and studied as I\nnever before had seen him.  Mrs. Freshett stayed so long mother had no\ntime to hear him, but he told her he had them all learned so he could\nrepeat them without a mistake.\n\nNext morning mother was busy, so she had no time then.  Father,\nShelley, and I rode on the front seat, mother, May, and Sally on the\nback, while the boys started early and walked.\n\nWhen we reached the top of the hill, the road was lined with carriages,\nwagons, spring wagons, and saddle horses.  Father found a place for our\nteam and we went down the walk between the hitching rack and the\ncemetery fence.  Mother opened the gate and knelt beside two small\ngraves covered with grass, shaded by yellow rose bushes, and marked\nwith little white stones.  She laid some flowers on each and wiped the\ndust from the carved letters with her handkerchief.  The little sisters\nwho had scarlet fever and whooping cough lay there.  Mother was still a\nminute and then she said softly:  \"'The Lord has given and the Lord has\ntaken away.  Blessed be the name of the Lord.'\"\n\nShe was very pale when she came to us, but her eyes were bright and she\nsmiled as she put her arms around as many of us as she could reach.\n\n\"What a beautiful horse!\" said Sally.  \"Look at that saddle and bridle!\nThe Pryor girl is here.\"\n\n\"Why should she come?\" asked Shelley.\n\n\"To show her fine clothes and queen it over us!\"\n\n\"Children, children!\" said mother.  \"'Judge not!'  This is a house of\nworship.  The Lord may be drawing her in His own way.  It is for us to\nhelp Him by being kind and making her welcome.\"\n\nAt the church door we parted and sat with our teachers, but for the\nfirst time as I went down the aisle I was not thinking of my linen\ndress, my patent leather slippers, and my pretty curls.  It suddenly\nseemed cheap to me to twist my hair when it was straight as a shingle,\nand cut my head on tin.  If the Lord had wanted me to have curls, my\nhair would have been like Sally's.  Seemed to me hers tried to see into\nwhat big soft curls it could roll.  May said ours was so straight it\nbent back the other way.  Anyway, I made up my mind to talk it over\nwith father and always wear braids after that, if I could get him to\ncoax mother to let me.\n\nOur church was quite new and it was beautiful.  All the casings were\noiled wood, and the walls had just a little yellow in the last skin\ncoating used to make them smooth, so they were a creamy colour, and the\nblinds were yellow.  The windows were wide open and the wind drifted\nthrough, while the birds sang as much as they ever do in August, among\nthe trees and bushes of the cemetery.  Every one had planted so many\nflowers of all kinds on the graves you could scent sweet odours.  Often\na big, black-striped, brown butterfly came sailing in through one of\nthe windows, followed the draft across the room, and out of another.  I\nwas thinking something funny: it was about what the Princess had said\nof other people, and whether hers were worse.  I looked at my father\nsitting in calm dignity in his Sunday suit and thought him quite as\nfine and handsome as mother did.  Every Sabbath he wore the same suit,\nhe sat in the same spot, he worshipped the Lord in his calm, earnest\nway.  The ministers changed, but father was as much a part of the\nservice as the Bible on the desk or the communion table.  I wondered if\npeople said things about him, and if they did, what they were.  I never\nhad heard.  Twisting in my seat, one by one I studied the faces on the\nmen's side, and then the women.  It was a mighty good-looking crowd.\nSome had finer clothes than others--that is always the way--but as a\nrule every one was clean, neat, and good to see.  From some you\nscarcely could turn away.  There was Widow Fall.  She was French, from\nVirginia, and she talked like little tinkly notes of music.  I just\nloved to hear her, and she walked like high-up royalty.  Her dress was\nalways black, with white bands at the neck and sleeves, black rustly\nsilk, and her eyes and hair were like the dress.  There was a little\nred on her cheeks and lips, and her face was always grave until she saw\nyou directly before her, and then she smiled the sweetest smile.\n\nMaybe Sarah Hood was not pretty, but there was something about her lean\nface and shining eyes that made you look twice before you were sure of\nit, and by that time you had got so used to her, you liked her better\nas she was, and wouldn't have changed her for anything.  Mrs. Fritz had\na pretty face and dresses and manners, and so did Hannah Dover, only\nshe talked too much.  So I studied them and remembered what the\nPrincess had said, and I wondered if she heard some one say that Peter\nJustice beat his wife, or if she showed it in her face and manner.  She\nreminded me of a scared cowslip that had been cut and laid in the sun\nan hour.  I don't know as that expresses it.  Perhaps a flower couldn't\nlook scared, but it could be wilted and faded.  I wondered if she ever\nhad bright hair, laughing eyes, and red in her lips and cheeks.  She\nmust have been pretty if she had.\n\nAt last I reached my mother.  There was nothing scared or faded about\nher, and she was dreadfully sick too, once in a while since she had the\nfever.  She was a little bit of a woman, coloured like a wild rose\npetal, face and body--a piece of pink porcelain Dutch, father said.\nShe had brown eyes, hair like silk, and she always had three best\ndresses.  There was one of alpaca or woollen, of black, gray or brown,\nand two silks.  Always there was a fine rustly black one with a bonnet\nand mantle to match, and then a softer, finer one of either gold brown,\nlike her hair, or dainty gray, like a dove's wing.  When these grew too\nold for fine use, she wore them to Sunday-school and had a fresh one\nfor best.  There was a new gray in her closet at home, so she put on\nthe old brown to-day, and she was lovely in it.\n\nUsually the minister didn't come for church services until\nSunday-school was half over, so the superintendent read a chapter,\nDaddy Debs prayed, and all of us stood up and sang: \"Ring Out the Joy\nBells.\"  Then the superintendent read the lesson over as impressively\nas he could.  The secretary made his report, we sang another song,\ngathered the pennies, and each teacher took a class and talked over the\nlesson a few minutes.  Then we repeated the verses we had committed to\nmemory to our teachers; the member of each class who had learned the\nnicest texts, and knew them best, was selected to recite before the\nschool.  Beginning with the littlest people, we came to the big folks.\nEach one recited two texts until they reached the class above mine.  We\nwalked to the front, stood inside the altar, made a little bow, and the\nsuperintendent kept score.  I could see that mother appeared worried\nwhen Leon's name was called for his class, for she hadn't heard him,\nand she was afraid he would forget.\n\nAmong the funny things about Leon was this: while you had to drive\nother boys of his age to recite, you almost had to hold him to keep him\nfrom it.  Father said he was born for a politician or a preacher, if he\nwould be good, and grow into the right kind of a man to do such\nresponsible work.\n\n\"I forgot several last Sabbath, so I have thirteen to-day,\" he said\npolitely.\n\nOf course no one expected anything like that.  You never knew what\nmight happen when Leon did anything.  He must have been about sixteen.\nHe was a slender lad, having almost sandy hair, like his English\ngrandfather.  He wore a white ruffled shirt with a broad collar, and\ncuffs turning back over his black jacket, and his trousers fitted his\nslight legs closely.  The wind whipped his soft black tie a little and\nruffled the light hair where it was longest and wavy above his\nforehead.  Such a perfect picture of innocence you never saw.  There\nwas one part of him that couldn't be described any better than the way\nMr. Rienzi told about his brother in his \"Address to the Romans,\" in\nMcGuffey's Sixth.  \"The look of heaven on his face\" stayed most of the\ntime; again, there was a dealish twinkle that sparkled and flashed\nwhile he was thinking up something mischievous to do.  When he was\nfighting angry, and going to thrash Absalom Saunders or die trying, he\nwas plain white and his eyes were like steel.  Mother called him\n\"Weiscope,\" half the time.  I can only spell the way that sounds, but\nit means \"white-head,\" and she always used that name when she loved him\nmost.  \"The look of heaven\" was strong on his face now.\n\n\"One,\" said the recording secretary.\n\n\"Jesus wept,\" answered Leon promptly.\n\nThere was not a sound in the church.  You could almost hear the\nbutterflies pass.  Father looked down and laid his lower lip in folds\nwith his fingers, like he did sometimes when it wouldn't behave to suit\nhim.\n\n\"Two,\" said the secretary after just a breath of pause.\n\nLeon looked over the congregation easily and then fastened his eyes on\nAbram Saunders, the father of Absalom, and said reprovingly:  \"Give not\nsleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eyelids.\"\n\nAbram straightened up suddenly and blinked in astonishment, while\nfather held fast to his lip.\n\n\"Three,\" called the secretary hurriedly.\n\nLeon shifted his gaze to Betsy Alton, who hadn't spoken to her next\ndoor neighbour in five years.\n\n\"Hatred stirreth up strife,\" he told her softly, \"but love covereth all\nsins.\"\n\nThings were so quiet it seemed as if the air would snap.\n\n\"Four.\"\n\nThe mild blue eyes travelled back to the men's side and settled on\nIsaac Thomas, a man too lazy to plow and sow land his father had left\nhim.  They were not so mild, and the voice was touched with command:\n\"Go to the ant, thou sluggard, consider her ways and be wise.\"\n\nStill that silence.\n\n\"Five,\" said the secretary hurriedly, as if he wished it were over.\nBack came the eyes to the women's side and past all question looked\nstraight at Hannah Dover.\n\n\"As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman without\ndiscretion.\"\n\n\"Six,\" said the secretary and looked appealingly at father, whose face\nwas filled with dismay.\n\nAgain Leon's eyes crossed the aisle and he looked directly at the man\nwhom everybody in the community called \"Stiff-necked Johnny.\"\n\nI think he was rather proud of it, he worked so hard to keep them doing\nit.\n\n\"Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck,\" Leon\ncommanded him.\n\nToward the door some one tittered.\n\n\"Seven,\" called the secretary hastily.\n\nLeon glanced around the room.\n\n\"But how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in\nunity,\" he announced in delighted tones as if he had found it out by\nhimself.\n\n\"Eight,\" called the secretary with something like a breath of relief.\n\nOur angel boy never had looked so angelic, and he was beaming on the\nPrincess.\n\n\"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee,\" he told her.\n\nLaddie would thrash him for that.\n\nInstantly after, \"Nine,\" he recited straight at Laddie:  \"I made a\ncovenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?\"\n\nMore than one giggled that time.\n\n\"Ten!\" came almost sharply.\n\nLeon looked scared for the first time.  He actually seemed to shiver.\nMaybe he realized at last that it was a pretty serious thing he was\ndoing.  When he spoke he said these words in the most surprised voice\nyou ever heard:  \"I was almost in all evil in the midst of the\ncongregation and assembly.\"\n\n\"Eleven.\"\n\nPerhaps these words are in the Bible.  They are not there to read the\nway Leon repeated them, for he put a short pause after the first name,\nand he glanced toward our father:  \"Jesus Christ, the SAME, yesterday,\nand to-day, and forever!\"\n\nSure as you live my mother's shoulders shook.\n\n\"Twelve.\"\n\nSuddenly Leon seemed to be forsaken.  He surely shrank in size and\nappeared abused.\n\n\"When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me\nup,\" he announced, and looked as happy over the ending as he had seemed\nforlorn at the beginning.\n\n\"Thirteen.\"\n\n\"The Lord is on my side; I will not fear; what can man do unto me?\"\ninquired Leon of every one in the church.  Then he soberly made a bow\nand walked to his seat.\n\nFather's voice broke that silence.  \"Let us kneel in prayer,\" he said.\n\nHe took a step forward, knelt, laid his hands on the altar, closed his\neyes and turned his face upward.\n\n\"Our Heavenly Father, we come before Thee in a trying situation,\" he\nsaid.  \"Thy word of truth has been spoken to us by a thoughtless boy,\nwhether in a spirit of helpfulness or of jest, Thou knowest.  Since we\nare reasoning creatures, it little matters in what form Thy truth comes\nto us; the essential thing is that we soften our hearts for its\nentrance, and grow in grace by its application.  Tears of compassion\nsuch as our dear Saviour wept are in our eyes this morning as we plead\nwith Thee to help us to apply these words to the betterment of this\ncommunity.\"\n\nThen father began to pray.  If the Lord had been standing six feet in\nfront of him, and his life had depended on what he said, he could have\nprayed no harder.  Goodness knows how fathers remember.  He began at\n\"Jesus wept\" and told about this sinful world and why He wept over it;\nthen one at a time he took those other twelve verses and hammered them\ndown where they belonged much harder than Leon ever could by merely\nlooking at people.  After that he prayed all around each one so\nfervently that those who had been hit the very worst cried aloud and\nsaid:  \"Amen!\" You wouldn't think any one could do a thing like that;\nbut I heard and saw my father do it.\n\nWhen he arose the tears were running down his cheeks, and before him\nstood Leon.  He was white as could be, but he spoke out loudly and\nclearly.\n\n\"Please forgive me, sir; I didn't intend to hurt your feelings.  Please\nevery one forgive me.  I didn't mean to offend any one.  It happened\nthrough hunting short verses.  All the short ones seemed to be like\nthat, and they made me think----\"\n\nHe got no farther.  Father must have been afraid of what he might say\nnext.  He threw his arms around Leon's shoulders, drew him to the seat,\nand with the tears still rolling, he laughed as happily as you ever\nheard, and he cried:  \"'Sweeping through the Gates!' All join in!\"\n\nYou never heard such singing in your life.  That was another wonderful\nthing.  My father didn't know the notes.  He couldn't sing; he said so\nhimself.  Neither could half the people there, yet all of them were\nsinging at the tops of their voices, and I don't believe the angels in\nHeaven could make grander music.  My father was leading:\n\n\"These, these are they, who in the conflict dire----\"\n\n\nYou could tell Emanuel Ripley had been in the war from the way he\nroared:\n\n\"Boldly have stood amidst the hottest fire----\"\n\n\nThe Widow Fall soared above all of them on the next line; her man was\nthere, and maybe she was lonely and would have been glad to go to him:\n\n\"Jesus now says, 'Come up higher----'\"\n\n\nThen my little mother:\n\n\"Washed in the blood of the Lamb----\"\n\n\nLike thunder all of them rolled into the chorus:\n\n\"Sweepin, through the gates to the New Jerusalem----\"\n\n\nYou wouldn't have been left out of that company for anything in all\nthis world, and nothing else ever could make you want to go so badly as\nto hear every one sing, straight from the heart, a grand old song like\nthat.  It is no right way to have to sit and keep still, and pay other\npeople money to sing about Heaven to you.  No matter if you can't sing\nby note, if your heart and soul are full, until they are running over,\nso that you are forced to sing as those people did, whether you can or\nnot, you are sure to be straight on the way to the Gates.\n\nBefore three lines were finished my father was keeping time like a\nchoirmaster, his face all beaming with shining light; mother was\nrocking on her toes like a wood robin on a twig at twilight, and at the\nend of the chorus she cried \"Glory!\" right out loud, and turned and\nstarted down the aisle, shaking hands with every one, singing as she\nwent.  When she reached Betsy Alton she held her hand and led her down\nthe aisle straight toward Rachel Brown.\n\nWhen Rachel saw them coming she hurried to meet them, and they shook\nhands and were glad to make up as any two people you ever saw.  It must\nhave been perfectly dreadful to see a woman every day for five years,\nand not to give her a pie, when you felt sure yours were better than\nshe could make, or loan her a new pattern, or tell her first who had a\nbaby, or was married, or dead, or anything like that.  It was no wonder\nthey felt glad.  Mother came on, and as she passed me the verses were\nall finished and every one began talking and moving.  Johnny Dover\nforgot his neck and shook hands too, and father pronounced the\nbenediction.  He always had to when the minister wasn't there, because\nhe was ordained himself, and you didn't dare pronounce the benediction\nunless you were.\n\nEvery one began talking again, and wondering if the minister wouldn't\ncome soon, and some one went out to see.  There was mother standing\nonly a few feet from the Princess, and I thought of something.  I had\nseen it done often enough, but I never had tried it myself, yet I\nwanted to so badly, there was no time to think how scared I would be.\nI took mother's hand and led her a few steps farther and said:\n\"Mother, this is my friend, Pamela Pryor.\"\n\nI believe I did it fairly well.  Mother must have been surprised, but\nshe put out her hand.\n\n\"I didn't know Miss Pryor and you were acquainted.\"\n\n\"It's only been a little while,\" I told her.  \"I met her when I was on\nsome business with the Fairies.  They know everything and they told me\nher father was busy\"--I thought she wouldn't want me to tell that he\nwas plain CROSS, where every one could hear, so I said \"busy\" for\npoliteness--\"and her mother not very strong, and that she was a good\ngirl, and dreadfully lonesome.  Can't you do something, mother?\"\n\n\"Well, I should think so!\" said mother, for her heart was soft as rose\nleaves.  Maybe you won't believe this, but it's quite true.  My mother\ntook the Princess' arm and led her to Sally and Shelley, and introduced\nher to all the girls.  By the time the minister came and mother went\nback to her seat, she had forgotten all about the \"indisposed\" word she\ndisliked, and as you live!  she invited the Princess to go home with us\nto dinner.  She stood tall and straight, her eyes very bright, and her\ncheeks a little redder than usual, as she shook hands and said a few\npleasant words that were like from a book, they fitted and were so\nright.  When mother asked her to dinner she said:  \"Thank you kindly.\nI should be glad to go, but my people expect me at home and they would\nbe uneasy.  Perhaps you would allow me to ride over some week day and\nbecome acquainted?\"\n\nMother said she would be happy to have her, and Shelley said so too,\nbut Sally was none too cordial.  She had dark curls and pink cheeks\nherself, and every one had said she was the prettiest girl in the\ncounty before Shelley began to blossom out and show what she was going\nto be.  Sally never minded that, but when the Princess came she was a\nlittle taller, and her hair was a trifle longer, and heavier, and\nblacker, and her eyes were a little larger and darker, and where Sally\nhad pink skin and red lips, the Princess was dark as olive, and her\nlips and cheeks were like red velvet.  Anyway, the Princess had said\nshe would come over; mother and Shelley had been decent to her, and\nSally hadn't been exactly insulting.  It would be a little more than\nyou could expect for her to be wild about the Princess.  I believe she\nwas pleased over having been invited to dinner, and as she was a\nstranger she couldn't know that mother had what we called the\n\"invitation habit.\"\n\nI have seen her ask from fifteen to twenty in one trip down the aisle\non Sunday morning.  She wanted them to come too; the more who came, the\nbetter she liked it.  If the hitching rack and barnyard were full on\nSunday she just beamed.  If the sermon pleased her, she invited more.\nThat morning she was feeling so good she asked seventeen; and as she\nonly had dressed six chickens--third table, backs and ham, for me as\nusual; but when the prospects were as now, I always managed to coax a\nfew gizzards from Candace; she didn't dare give me livers--they were\ncounted.  Almost everyone in the church was the happiest that morning\nthey had been in years.  When the preacher came, he breathed it from\nthe air, and it worked on him so he preached the best sermon he ever\nhad, and never knew that Leon made him do it.\n\nMaybe after all it's a good thing to tell people about their meanness\nand give them a stirring up once in a while.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nMr. Pryor's Door\n\n  \"Grief will be joy if on its edge\n  Fall soft that holiest ray,\n  Joy will be grief if no faint pledge\n  Be there of heavenly day.\"\n\n\n\"Have Sally and Peter said anything about getting married yet?\" asked\nmy big sister Lucy of mother.  Lucy was home on a visit.  She was\nbathing her baby and mother was sewing.\n\n\"Not a word!\"\n\n\"Are they engaged?\"\n\n\"Sally hasn't mentioned it.\"\n\n\"Well, can't you find out?\"\n\n\"How could I?\" asked mother.\n\n\"Why, watch them a little and see how they act when they are together.\nIf he kisses her when he leaves, of course they are engaged.\"\n\n\"It would be best to wait until Sally tells me,\" laughed mother.\n\nI heard this from the back steps.  Neither mother nor Lucy knew I was\nthere.  I went in to see if they would let me take the baby.  Of course\nthey wouldn't!  Mother took it herself.  She was rocking, and softly\nsinging my Dutch song that I loved best; I can't spell it, but it\nsounds like this:\n\n  \"Trus, trus, trill;\n  Der power rid der fill,\n  Fill sphring aveck,\n  Plodschlicter power in der dreck.\"\n\n\nOnce I asked mother to sing it in English, and she couldn't because it\ndidn't rhyme that way and the words wouldn't fit the notes; it was\njust, \"Trot, trot, trot, a boy rode a colt.  The colt sprang aside;\ndown went the boy in the dirt.\"\n\n\"Aw, don't sing my song to that little red, pug-nosed bald-head!\" I\nsaid.\n\nReally, it was a very nice baby; I only said that because I wanted to\nhold it, and mother wouldn't give it up.  I tried to coax May to the\ndam snake hunting, but she couldn't go, so I had to amuse myself.  I\nhad a doll, but I never played with it except when I was dressed up on\nSunday.  Anyway, what's the use of a doll when there's a live baby in\nthe house?  I didn't care much for my playhouse since I had seen one so\nmuch finer that Laddie had made for the Princess.  Of course I knew\nmoss wouldn't take root in our orchard as it did in the woods, neither\nwould willow cuttings or the red flowers.  Finally, I decided to go\nhunting.  I went into the garden and gathered every ripe touch-me-not\npod I could find, and all the portulaca.  Then I stripped the tiger\nlilies of each little black ball at the bases of the leaves, and took\nall the four o'clock seed there was.  Then I got my biggest alder\npopgun and started up the road toward Sarah Hood's.\n\nI was going along singing a little verse; it wasn't Dutch either; the\nold baby could have that if it wanted it.  Soon as I got from sight of\nthe house I made a powderhorn of a curled leaf, loaded my gun with\nportulaca powder, rammed in a tiger lily bullet, laid the weapon across\nmy shoulder, and stepped high and lightly as Laddie does when he's in\nthe Big Woods hunting for squirrel.  It must have been my own\nsinging--I am rather good at hearing things, but I never noticed a\nsound that time, until a voice like a rusty saw said:  \"Good morning,\nNimrod!\"\n\nI sprang from the soft dust and landed among the dog fennel of a fence\ncorner, in a flying leap.  Then I looked.  It was the Princess' father,\ntall, and gray, and grim, riding a big black horse that seemed as if it\nhad been curried with the fine comb and brushed with the grease rag.\n\n\"Good morning!\" I said when I could speak.\n\n\"Am I correct in the surmise that you are on the chase with a popgun?\"\nhe asked politely.\n\n\"Yes sir,\" I answered, getting my breath the best I could.\n\nIt came easier after I noticed he didn't seem to be angry about\nanything.\n\n\"Where is your hunting ground, and what game are you after?\" he asked\ngravely.\n\n\"You can see the great African jungle over there.  I am going to hunt\nfor lions and tigers.\"\n\nYou always must answer politely any one who speaks to you; and you get\nsoundly thrashed, at least at our house, if you don't be politest of\nall to an older person especially with white hair.  Father is extremely\nparticular about white hair.  It is a \"crown of glory,\" when it is\nfound in the way of the Lord.  Mahlon Pryor had enough crown of glory\nfor three men, but maybe his wasn't exactly glory, because he wasn't in\nthe way of the Lord.  He was in a way of his own.  He must have had\nmuch confidence in himself.  At our house we would rather trust in the\nLord.  I only told him about the lions and tigers because he asked me,\nand that was the way I played.  But you should have heard him laugh.\nYou wouldn't have supposed to see him that he could.\n\n\"Umph!\" he said at last.  \"I am a little curious about your ammunition.\nJust how to you bring down your prey?\"\n\n\"I use portulaca powder and tiger lily bullets on the tigers, and four\no'clocks on the lions,\" I said.\n\nYou could have heard him a mile, dried up as he was.\n\n\"I used to wear a red coat and ride to the hounds fox hunting,\" he\nsaid.  \"It's great sport.  Won't you take me with you to the jungle?\"\n\nI didn't want him in the least, but if any one older asks right out to\ngo with you, what can you do?  I am going to tell several things you\nwon't believe, and this is one of them:  He got off his horse, tied it\nto the fence, and climbed over after me.  He went on asking questions\nand of course I had to tell him.  Most of what he wanted to know, his\npeople should have taught him before he was ten years old, but father\nsays they do things differently in England.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be many trees in the jungle.\"\n\n\"Well, there's one, and it's about the most important on our land,\" I\ntold him.  \"Father wouldn't cut it down for a farm.  You see that\nlittle dark bag nearly as big as your fist, swinging out there on that\nlimb?  Well, every spring one of these birds, yellow as orange peel,\nwith velvet black wings, weaves a nest like that, and over on that big\nbranch, high up, one just as bright red as the other is yellow, and the\nsame black wings, builds a cradle for his babies.  Father says a red\nbird and a yellow one keeping house in the same tree is the biggest\nthing that ever happened in our family.  They come every year and that\nis their tree.  I believe father would shoot any one who drove them\naway.\"\n\n\"Your father is a gunner also?\" he asked, and I thought he was laughing\nto himself.\n\n\"He's enough of a gunner to bring mother in a wagon from Pennsylvania\nall the way here, and he kept wolves, bears, Indians, and Gypsies from\nher, and shot things for food.  Yes sir, my father can shoot if he\nwants to, better than any of our family except Laddie.\"\n\n\"And does Laddie shoot well?\"\n\n\"Laddie does everything well,\" I answered proudly.  \"He won't try to do\nanything at all, until he practises so he can do it well.\"\n\n\"Score one for Laddie,\" he said in a queer voice.\n\n\"Are you in a hurry about the lions and tigers?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" he answered.\n\n\"Well, here I always stop and let Governor Oglesby go swimming,\" I said.\n\nMr. Mahlon Pryor sat on the bank of our Little Creek, took off his hat\nand shook back his hair as if the wind felt good on his forehead.  I\nfished Dick Oglesby from the ammunition in my apron pocket, and held\nhim toward the cross old man, and he wasn't cross at all.  It's funny\nhow you come to get such wrong ideas about people.\n\n\"My big married sister who lives in Westchester sent him to me last\nChristmas,\" I explained.  \"I have another doll, great big, with a\nScotch plaid dress made from pieces of mine, but I only play with her\non Sunday when I dare not do much else.  I like Dick the best because\nhe fits my apron pocket.  Father wanted me to change his name and call\nhim Oliver P. Morton, after a friend of his, but I told him this doll\nhad to be called by the name he came with, and if he wanted me to have\none named for his friend, to get it, and I'd play with it.\"\n\n\"What did he do?\"\n\n\"He didn't want one named Morton that much.\"\n\nMr. Pryor took Dick Oglesby in his fingers and looked at his curly\nblack hair and blue eyes, his chubby outstretched arms, like a baby\nwhen it wants you to take it, and his plump little feet and the white\nshirt with red stripes all a piece of him as he was made, and said:\n\"The honourable governor of our sister state seems a little weighty; I\nam at a loss to understand how he swims.\"\n\n\"It's a new way,\" I said.  \"He just stands still and the water swims\naround him.  It's very easy for him.\"\n\nThen I carried Dick to the water, waded in and stood him against a\nstone.  Something funny happened instantly.  It always did.  I found it\nout one day when I got some apple butter on the governor giving him a\nbite of my bread, and put him in the wash bowl to soak.  He was two and\na half inches tall; but the minute you stood him in water he went down\nto about half that height and spread out to twice his size around.  You\nshould have heard Mr. Pryor.\n\n\"If you will lie on the bank and watch you'll have more to laugh at\nthan that,\" I promised.\n\nHe lay down and never paid the least attention to his clothes.  Pretty\nsoon a little chub fish came swimming around to make friends with\nGovernor Oglesby, and then a shiner and some more chub.  They nibbled\nat his hands and toes, and then went flashing away, and from under the\nstone came backing a big crayfish and seized the governor by the leg\nand started dragging him, so I had to jump in and stop it.  I took a\nshot at the crayfish with the tiger ammunition and then loaded for\nlions.\n\nWe went on until the marsh became a thicket of cattails, bulrushes,\nwillow bushes, and blue flags; then I found a path where the lions left\nthe jungle, hid Mr. Pryor and told him he must be very still or they\nwouldn't come.  At last I heard one.  I touched Mr. Pryor's sleeve to\nwarn him to keep his eyes on the trail.  Pretty soon the lion came in\nsight.  Really it was only a little gray rabbit hopping along, but when\nit was opposite us, I pinged it in the side, it jumped up and turned a\nsomersault with surprise, and squealed a funny little squeal,--well, I\nwondered if Mr. Pryor's people didn't hear him, and think he had gone\ncrazy as Paddy Ryan.  I never did hear any one laugh so.  I thought if\nhe enjoyed it like that, I'd let him shoot one.  I do May sometimes; so\nwe went to another place I knew where there was a tiger's den, and I\nloaded with tiger lily bullets, gave him the gun and showed him where\nto aim.  After we had waited a long time out came a muskrat, and\nstarted for the river.  I looked to see why Mr. Pryor didn't shoot, and\nthere he was gazing at it as if a snake had charmed him; his hands\nshaking a little, his cheeks almost red, his eyes very bright.\n\n\"Shoot!\" I whispered.  \"It won't stay all day!\"\n\nHe forgot how to push the ramrod like I showed him, so he reached out\nand tried to hit it with the gun.\n\n\"Don't do that!\" I said.\n\n\"But it's getting away!  It's getting away!\" he cried.\n\n\"Well, what if it is?\" I asked, half provoked.  \"Do you suppose I\nreally would hurt a poor little muskrat?  Maybe it has six hungry\nbabies in its home.\"\n\n\"Oh THAT way,\" he said, but he kept looking at it, so he made me think\nif I hadn't been there, he would have thrown a stone or hit it with a\nstick.  It is perfectly wonderful about how some men can't get along\nwithout killing things, such little bits of helpless creatures too.  I\nthought he'd better be got from the jungle, so I invited him to see the\nplace at the foot of the hill below our orchard where some men thought\nthey had discovered gold before the war.  They had been to California\nin '49, and although they didn't come home with millions, or anything\nelse except sick and tired, they thought they had learned enough about\ngold to know it when they saw it.\n\nI told him about it and he was interested and anxious to see the place.\nIf there had been a shovel, I am quite sure he would have gone to\ndigging.  He kept poking around with his boot toe, and he said maybe\nthe yokels didn't look good.\n\nHe said our meadow was a beautiful place, and when he praised the creek\nI told him about the wild ducks, and he laughed again.  He didn't seem\nto be the same man when we went back to the road.  I pulled some sweet\nmarsh grass and gave his horse bites, so Mr. Pryor asked if I liked\nanimals.  I said I loved horses, Laddie's best of all.  He asked about\nit and I told him.\n\n\"Hasn't your father but one thoroughbred?\"\n\n\"Father hasn't any,\" I said.  \"Flos really belongs to Laddie, and we\nare mighty glad he has her.\"\n\n\"You should have one soon, yourself,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, if the rest of them will hurry up and marry off, so the expenses\nwon't be so heavy, maybe I can.\"\n\n\"How many of you are there?\" he asked.\n\n\"Only twelve,\" I said.\n\nHe looked down the road at our house.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me you have twelve children there?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Oh no!\" I answered.  \"Some of the big boys have gone into business in\nthe cities around, and some of the girls are married.  Mother says she\nhas only to show her girls in the cities to have them snapped up like\nhot cakes.\"\n\n\"I fancy that is the truth,\" he said.  \"I've passed the one who rides\nthe little black pony and she is a picture.  A fine, healthy,\nsensible-appearing young woman!\"\n\n\"I don't think she's as pretty as your girl,\" I said.\n\n\"Perhaps I don't either,\" he replied, smiling at me.\n\nThen he mounted his horse.\n\n\"I don't remember that I ever have passed that house,\" he said,\n\"without hearing some one singing.  Does it go on all the time?\"\n\n\"Yes, unless mother is sick.\"\n\n\"And what is it all about?\"\n\n\"Oh just joy!  Gladness that we are alive, that we have things to do\nthat we like, and praising the Lord.\"\n\n\"Umph!\" said Mr. Pryor.\n\n\"It's just letting out what our hearts are full of,\" I told him.\n\"Don't you know that song:\n\n  \"'Tis the old time religion\n  And you cannot keep it still?'\"\n\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"It's an awful nice song,\" I explained.  \"After it sings about all the\nother things religion is good for, there is one line that says:  'IT'S\nGOOD FOR THOSE IN TROUBLE.'\"\n\nI looked at him straight and hard, but he only turned white and seemed\nsick.\n\n\"So?\" said Mr. Pryor.  \"Well, thank you for the most interesting\nmorning I've had this side England.  I should be delighted if you would\ncome and hunt lions in my woods with me some time.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you open the door to children?\"\n\n\"Certainly we open the door to children,\" he said, and as I live, he\nlooked so sad I couldn't help thinking he was sorry to close it against\nany one.  A mystery is the dreadfulest thing.\n\n\"Then if children don't matter, maybe I can come lion-hunting some time\nwith the Princess, after she has made the visit at our house she said\nshe would.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  I hadn't been informed that my daughter contemplated visiting\nyour house,\" he said.  \"When was it arranged?\"\n\n\"My mother invited her last Sunday.\"\n\nI didn't like the way he said:  \"O-o-o-h!\"  Some way it seemed\ninsulting to my mother.\n\n\"She did it to please me,\" I said.  \"There was a Fairy Princess told me\nthe other day that your girl felt like a stranger, and that to be a\nstranger was the hardest thing in all the world.  She sat a little way\nfrom the others, and she looked so lonely.  I pulled my mother's sleeve\nand led her to your girl and made them shake hands, and then mother HAD\nto ask her to come to dinner with us.  She always invites every one she\nmeets coming down the aisle; she couldn't help asking your girl, too.\nShe said she was expected at home, but she'd come some day and get\nacquainted.  She needn't if you object.  My mother only asked her\nbecause she thought she was lonely, and maybe she wanted to come.\"\n\nHe sat there staring straight ahead and he seemed to grow whiter, and\nolder, and colder every minute.\n\n\"Possibly she is lonely,\" he said at last.  \"This isn't much like the\nlife she left.  Perhaps she does feel herself a stranger.  It was very\nkind of your mother to invite her.  If she wants to come, I shall make\nno objections.\"\n\n\"No, but my father will,\" I said.\n\nHe straightened up as if something had hit him.  \"Why will he object?\"\n\n\"On account of what you said about God at our house,\" I told him.  \"And\nthen, too, father's people were from England, and he says real\nEnglishmen have their doors wide open, and welcome people who offer\nfriendliness.\"\n\nMr. Pryor hit his horse an awful blow.  It reared and went racing up\nthe road until I thought it was running away.  I could see I had made\nhim angry enough to burst.  Mother always tells me not to repeat\nthings; but I'm not smart enough to know what to say, so I don't see\nwhat is left but to tell what mother, or father, or Laddie says when\ngrown people ask me questions.\n\nI went home, but every one was too busy even to look at me, so I took\nBobby under my arm, hunted father, and told him all about the morning.\nI wondered what he would think.  I never found out.\n\nHe wouldn't say anything, so Bobby and I went across the lane, and\nclimbed the gate into the orchard to see if Hezekiah were there and\nwanted to fight.  He hadn't time to fight Bobby because he was busy\nchasing every wild jay from our orchard.  By the time he got that done,\nhe was tired, so he came hopping along on branches above us as Bobby\nand I went down the west fence beside the lane.\n\nIf I had been compelled to choose the side of our orchard I liked best,\nI don't know which I would have selected.  The west side--that is, the\none behind the dooryard--was running over with interesting things.  Two\ngates opened into it, one from near each corner of the yard.  Between\nthese there was quite a wide level space, where mother fed the big\nchickens and kept the hens in coops with little ones.  She had to have\nthem close enough that the big hawks were afraid to come to earth, or\nthey would take more chickens than they could pay for, by cleaning\nrabbits, snakes, and mice from the fields.  Then came a double row of\nprize peach trees; rare fruit that mother canned to take to county\nfairs.  One bore big, white freestones, and around the seed they were\npink as a rose.  One was a white cling, and one was yellow.  There was\na yellow freestone as big as a young sun, and as golden, and the\nqueerest of all was a cling purple as a beet.\n\nSometimes father read about the hairs of the head being numbered,\nbecause we were so precious in the sight of the Almighty.  Mother was\njust as particular with her purple tree; every peach on it was counted,\nand if we found one on the ground, we had to carry it to her, because\nit MIGHT be sound enough to can or spice for a fair, or she had\npromised the seed to some one halfway across the state.  At each end of\nthe peach row was an enormous big pear tree; not far from one the\nchicken house stood on the path to the barn, and beside the other the\nsmoke house with the dog kennel a yard away.  Father said there was a\ndistinct relationship between a smoke house and a dog kennel, and\nbulldogs were best.  Just at present we were out of bulldogs, but\nJones, Jenkins and Co. could make as much noise as any dog you ever\nheard.  On the left grew the plum trees all the way to the south fence,\nand I think there was one of every kind in the fruit catalogues.\nFather spent hours pruning, grafting, and fertilizing them.  He said\nthey required twice as much work as peaches.\n\nAround the other sides of the orchard were two rows of peach trees of\nevery variety; but one cling on the north was just a little the best of\nany, and we might eat all we wanted from any tree we liked, after\nfather tested them and said: \"Peaches are ripe!\"  In the middle were\nthe apple; selected trees, planted, trimmed, and cultivated like human\nbeings.  The apples were so big and fine they were picked by hand,\nwrapped in paper, packed in barrels, and all we could not use at home\nwent to J. B. White in Fort Wayne for the biggest fruit house in the\nstate.  My! but father was proud!  He always packed especially fine\nones for Mr. White's family.  He said he liked him, because he was a\nreal sandy Scotchman, who knew when an apple was right, and wasn't\nafraid to say so.\n\nOn the south side of the orchard there was the earliest June apple\ntree.  The apples were small, bright red with yellow stripes, crisp,\njuicy and sweet enough to be just right.  The tree was very large, and\nso heavy it leaned far to the northeast.\n\nThis sounds like make-believe, but it's gospel truth.  Almost two feet\nfrom the ground there was a big round growth, the size of a hash bowl.\nThe tree must have been hurt when very small and the place enlarged\nwith the trunk.  Now it made a grand step.  If you understood that no\none could keep from running the last few rods from the tree, then\nfigured on the help to be had from this step, you could see how we went\nup it like squirrels.  All the bark on the south side was worn away and\nthe trunk was smooth and shiny.  The birds loved to nest among the\nbranches, and under the peach tree in the fence corner opposite was a\nbig bed of my mother's favourite wild flowers, blue-eyed Marys.  They\nhad dainty stems from six to eight inches high and delicate heads of\nbloom made up of little flowers, two petals up, blue, two turning down,\nwhite.  Perhaps you don't know about anything prettier than that.\nThere were maiden-hair ferns among them too! and the biggest lichens\nyou ever saw on the fence, while in the hollow of a rotten rail a\nlittle chippy bird always built a hair nest.  She got the hairs at our\nbarn, for most of them were gray from our carriage horses, Ned and Jo.\nAll down that side of the orchard the fence corners were filled with\nlong grass and wild flowers, a few alder bushes left to furnish berries\nfor the birds, and wild roses for us, to keep their beauty impressed on\nus, father said.\n\nThe east end ran along the brow of a hill so steep we coasted down it\non the big meat board all winter.  The board was six inches thick, two\nand a half feet wide, and six long.  Father said slipping over ice and\nsnow gave it the good scouring it needed, and it was thick enough to\nlast all our lives, so we might play with it as we pleased.  At least\nseven of us could go skimming down that hill and halfway across the\nmeadow on it.  In the very place we slid across, in summer lay the\ncowslip bed.  The world is full of beautiful spots, but I doubt if any\nof them ever were prettier than that.  Father called it swale.  We\ndidn't sink deep, but all summer there was water standing there.  The\ngrass was long and very sweet, there were ferns and a few calamus\nflowers, and there must have been an acre of cowslips--cowslips with\nbig-veined, heartshaped, green leaves, and large pale gold flowers.  I\nused to sit on the top rail of that orchard fence and look down at\nthem, and try to figure out what God was thinking when He created them,\nand I wished that I might have been where I could watch His face as He\nworked.\n\nHalfway across the east side was a gully where Leon and I found the\nUnderground Station, and from any place along the north you looked, you\nsaw the Little Creek and the marsh.  At the same time the cowslips were\nmost golden, the marsh was blue with flags, pink with smart weed, white\nand yellow with dodder, yellow with marsh buttercups having ragged\nfrosty leaves, while the yellow and the red birds flashed above it, the\nred crying, \"Chip,\" \"Chip,\" in short, sharp notes, the yellow spilling\nmusic all over the marsh while on wing.\n\nIt would take a whole book to describe the butterflies; once in a while\nyou scared up a big, wonderful moth, large as a sparrow; and the\norchard was alive with doves, thrushes, catbirds, bluebirds, vireos,\nand orioles.  When you climbed the fence, or a tree, and kept quiet,\nand heard the music and studied the pictures, it made you feel as if\nyou had to put it into words.  I often had meeting all by myself,\nunless Bobby and Hezekiah were along, and I tried to tell God what I\nthought about things.  Probably He was so busy making more birds and\nflowers for other worlds, He never heard me; but I didn't say anything\ndisrespectful at all, so it made no difference if He did listen.  It\njust seemed as if I must tell what I thought, and I felt better, not so\nfull and restless after I had finished.\n\nAll of us were alike about that.  At that minute I knew mother was\nhumming, as she did a dozen times a day:\n\n  \"I think when I read that sweet story of old,\n    When Jesus was here among men\n  How He called little children as lambs to His fold,\n    I should like to have been with Him then.\"\n\n\nLucy would be rocking her baby and singing, \"Hush, my dear, lie still\nand slumber.\"  Candace's favourite she made up about her man who had\nbeen killed in the war, when they had been married only six weeks,\nwhich hadn't given her time to grow tired of him if he hadn't been \"all\nher fancy painted.\"  She arranged the words like \"Ben Battle was a\nsoldier bold,\" and she sang them to suit herself, and cried every\nsingle minute:\n\n  \"They wrapped him in his uniform,\n    They laid him in the tomb,\n  My aching heart I thought 'twould break,\n    But such was my sad doom.\"\n\n\nCandace just loved that song.  She sang it all the time.  Leon said our\npie always tasted salty from her tears, and he'd take a bite and smile\nat her sweetly and say:  \"How UNIFORM you get your pie, Candace!\"\n\nMay's favourite was \"Joy Bells.\"  Father would be whispering over to\nhimself the speech he was preparing to make at the next prayer-meeting.\nWe never could learn his speeches, because he read and studied so much\nit kept his head so full, he made a new one every time.  You could hear\nLaddie's deep bass booming the \"Bedouin Love Song\" for a mile; this\nminute it came rolling across the corn:\n\n  \"Open the door of thy heart,\n    And open thy chamber door,\n  And my kisses shall teach thy lips\n    The love that shall fade no more\n       Till the sun grows cold,\n       And the Stars are old,\n       And the leaves of the Judgment\n         Book unfold!\"\n\n\nI don't know how the Princess stood it.  If he had been singing that\nsong where I could hear it and I had known it was about me, as she must\nhave known he meant her, I couldn't have kept my arms from around his\nneck.  Over in the barn Leon was singing:\n\n  \"A life on the ocean wave,\n  A home on the rolling deep,\n  Where codfish waggle their tails\n  'Mid tadpoles two feet deep.\"\n\n\nThe minute he finished, he would begin reciting \"Marco Bozzaris,\" and\nyou could be sure that he would reach the last line only to commence on\nthe speech of \"Logan, Chief of the Mingoes,\" or any one of the fifty\nothers.  He could make your hair stand a little straighter than any one\nelse; the best teachers we ever had, or even Laddie, couldn't make you\nshivery and creepy as he could.  Because all of us kept going like that\nevery day, people couldn't pass without hearing, so THAT was what Mr.\nPryor meant.\n\nI had a pulpit in the southeast corner of the orchard.  I liked that\nplace best of all because from it you could see two sides at once.  The\nvery first little, old log cabin that had been on our land, the one my\nfather and mother moved into, had stood in that corner.  It was all\ngone now; but a flowerbed of tiny, purple iris, not so tall as the\ngrass, spread there, and some striped grass in the shadiest places, and\namong the flowers a lark brooded every spring.  In the fence corner\nmother's big white turkey hen always nested.  To protect her from rain\nand too hot sun, father had slipped some boards between the rails about\nthree feet from the ground.  After the turkey left, that was my pulpit.\n\nI stood there and used the top of the fence for my railing.\n\nThe little flags and all the orchard and birds were behind me; on one\nhand was the broad, grassy meadow with the creek running so swiftly, I\ncould hear it, and the breath of the cowslips came up the hill.\nStraight in front was the lane running down from the barn, crossing the\ncreek and spreading into the woods pasture, where the water ran wider\nand yet swifter, big forest trees grew, and bushes of berries, pawpaws,\nwillow, everything ever found in an Indiana thicket; grass under foot,\nand many wild flowers and ferns wherever the cattle and horses didn't\ntrample them, and bigger, wilder birds, many having names I didn't\nknow.  On the left, across the lane, was a large cornfield, with trees\nhere and there, and down the valley I could see the Big Creek coming\nfrom the west, the Big Hill with the church on top, and always the\nwhite gravestones around it.  Always too there was the sky overhead,\noften with clouds banked until you felt if you only could reach them,\nyou could climb straight to the gates that father was so fond of\nsinging about sweeping through.  Mostly there was a big hawk or a\nturkey buzzard hanging among them, just to show us that we were not so\nmuch, and that we couldn't shoot them, unless they chose to come down\nand give us a chance.\n\nI set Bobby and Hezekiah on the fence and stood between them.  \"We will\nopen service this morning by singing the thirty-fifth hymn,\" I said.\n\"Sister Dover, will you pitch the tune?\"\n\nThen I made my voice high and squeally like hers and sang:\n\n  \"Come ye that love the Lord,\n  And let your joys be known,\n  Join in a song of sweet accord,\n  And thus surround the throne.\"\n\n\nI sang all of it and then said:  \"Brother Hastings, will you lead us in\nprayer?\"\n\nThen I knelt down, and prayed Brother Hastings' prayer.  I could have\nrepeated any one of a dozen of the prayers the men of our church\nprayed, but I liked Brother Hastings' best, because it had the biggest\nwords in it.  I loved words that filled your mouth, and sounded as if\nyou were used to books.  It began sort of sing-songy and measured in\nstops, like a poetry piece:\n\n  \"Our Heavenly Father:  We come before Thee this morning,\n  Humble worms of the dust, imploring thy blessing.\n  We beseech Thee to forgive our transgressions,\n  Heal our backsliding, and love us freely.\"\n\n\nSometimes from there on it changed a little, but it always began and\nended exactly the same way.  Father said Brother Hastings was powerful\nin prayer, but he did wish he'd leave out the \"worms of the dust.\"  He\nsaid we were not \"worms of the dust\"; we were reasoning, progressive,\ninventive men and women.  He said a worm would never be anything except\na worm, but we could study and improve ourselves, help others, make\ngreat machines, paint pictures, write books, and go to an extent that\nmust almost amaze the Almighty Himself.  He said that if Brother\nHastings had done more plowing in his time, and had a little closer\nacquaintance with worms, he wouldn't be so ready to call himself and\nevery one else a worm.  Now if you are talking about cutworms or\nfishworms, father is right.  But there is that place where--\"Charles\nhis heel had raised, upon the humble worm to tread,\" and the worm\nlifted up its voice and spake thus to Charles:\n\n  \"I know I'm now among the things\n    Uncomely to your sight,\n  But, by and by, on splendid wings,\n    You'll see me high and bright.\"\n\n\nNow I'll bet a cent THAT is the kind of worm Brother Hastings said we\nwere.  I must speak to father about it.  I don't want him to be\nmistaken; and I really think he is about worms.  Of course he knows the\nkind that have wings and fly.  Brother Hastings mixed him up by saying\n\"worms of the dust\" when he should have said worms of the leaves.\nThose that go into little round cases in earth or spin cocoons on trees\nalways live on leaves, and many of them rear the head, having large\nhorns, and wave it in a manner far from humble.  So father and Brother\nHastings were both partly right, and partly wrong.\n\nWhen the prayer came to a close, where every one always said \"Amen,\" I\npunched Bobby and whispered, \"Crow, Bobby, crow!\" and he stood up and\nbrought it out strong, like he always did when I told him.  I had to\nstop the service to feed him a little wheat, to pay him for crowing;\nbut as no one was there except us, that didn't matter.  Then Hezekiah\ncrowded over for some, so I had to pretend I was Mrs. Daniels feeding\nher children caraway cake, like she always did in meeting.  If I had\nbeen the mother of children who couldn't have gone without things to\neat in church I'd have kept them at home.  Mrs. Daniels always had the\ncarpet greasy with cake crumbs wherever she sat, and mother didn't\nthink the Lord liked a dirty church any more than we would have wanted\na mussy house.  When I had Bobby and Hezekiah settled I took my text\nfrom my head, because I didn't know the meeting feeling was coming on\nme when I started, and I had brought no Bible along.\n\n\"Blessed are all men, but most blessed are they who hold their\ntempers.\"  I had to stroke Bobby a little and pat Hezekiah once in a\nwhile, to keep them from flying down and fighting, but mostly I could\ngive my attention to my sermon.\n\n\"We have only to look around us this morning to see that all men are\nblessed,\" I said.  \"The sky is big enough to cover every one.  If the\nsun gets too hot, there are trees for shade or the clouds come up for a\nwhile.  If the earth becomes too dry, it always rains before it is\neverlastingly too late.  There are birds enough to sing for every one,\nbutterflies enough to go around, and so many flowers we can't always\nkeep the cattle and horses from tramping down and even devouring\nbeautiful ones, like Daniel thought the lions would devour him--but\nthey didn't.  Wouldn't it be a good idea, O Lord, for You to shut the\ncows' mouths and save the cowslips also; they may not be worth as much\nas a man, but they are lots better looking, and they make fine greens.\nIt doesn't seem right for cows to eat flowers; but maybe it is as right\nfor them as it is for us.  The best way would be for our cattle to do\nlike that piece about the cow in the meadow exactly the same as ours:\n\n  \"'And through it ran a little brook,\n    Where oft the cows would drink,\n  And then lie down among the flowers,\n    That grew upon the brink.'\n\n\n\"You notice, O Lord, the cows did not eat the flowers in this instance;\nthey merely rested among them, and goodness knows, that's enough for\nany cow.  They had better done like the next verse, where it says:\n\n  \"'They like to lie beneath the trees,\n    All shaded by the boughs,\n  Whene'er the noontide heat came on:\n    Sure, they were happy cows!'\n\n\n\"Now, O Lord, this plainly teaches that if cows are happy, men should\nbe much more so, for like the cows, they have all Thou canst do for\nthem, and all they can do for themselves, besides.  So every man is\nblessed, because Thy bounty has provided all these things for him,\nwithout money and without price.  If some men are not so blessed as\nothers, it is their own fault, and not Yours.  You made the earth, and\nall that is therein, and You made the men.  Of course You had to make\nmen different, so each woman can tell which one belongs to her; but I\nbelieve it would have been a good idea while You were at it, if You\nwould have made all of them enough alike that they would all work.\nPerhaps it isn't polite of me to ask more of You than You saw fit to\ndo; and then, again, it may be that there are some things impossible,\neven to You.  If there is anything at all, seems as if making Isaac\nThomas work would be it.  Father says that man would rather starve and\nsee his wife and children hungry than to take off his coat, roll up his\nsleeves, and plow corn; so it was good enough for him when Leon said,\n'Go to the ant, thou sluggard,' right at him.  So, of course, Isaac is\nnot so blessed as some men, because he won't work, and thus he never\nknows whether he's going to have a big dinner on Sunday, until after\nsome one asks him, because he looks so empty.  Mother thinks it isn't\nfair to feed Isaac and send him home with his stomach full, while Mandy\nand the babies are sick and hungry.  But Isaac is some blessed, because\nhe has religion and gets real happy, and sings, and shouts, and he's\ngoing to Heaven when he dies.  He must wish he'd go soon, especially in\nwinter.\n\n\"There are men who do not have even this blessing, and to make things\nworse, O Lord, they get mad as fire and hit their horses, and look like\nall possessed.  The words of my text this morning apply especially to a\nman who has all the blessings Thou hast showered and flowered upon men\nwho work, or whose people worked and left them so much money they don't\nneed to, and yet a sadder face I never saw, or a crosser one.  He looks\nlike he was going to hit people, and he does hit his horse an awful\ncrack.  It's no way to hit a horse, not even if it balks, because it\ncan't hit back, and it's a cowardly thing to do.  If you rub their ears\nand talk to them, they come quicker, O our Heavenly Father, and if you\nhit them just because you are mad, it's a bigger sin yet.\n\n\"No man is nearly so blessed as he might be who goes around looking\nkilled with grief when he should cheer up, no matter what ails him; and\nwho shuts up his door and says his wife is sick when she isn't, and who\nscowls at every one, when he can be real pleasant if he likes, as some\nin Divine Presence can testify.  So we are going to beseech Thee, O\nLord, to lay Thy mighty hand upon the man who got mad this beautiful\nmorning and make him feel Thy might, until he will know for himself and\nnot another, that You are not a myth.  Teach him to have a pleasant\ncountenance, an open door, and to hold his temper.  Help him to come\nover to our house and be friendly with all his neighbours, and get all\nthe blessings You have provided for every one; but please don't make\nhim have any more trouble than he has now, for if You do, You'll surely\nkill him.  Have patience with him, and have mercy on him, O Lord!  Let\nus pray.\"\n\nThat time I prayed myself.  I looked into the sky just as straight and\nas far as I could see, and if I had any influence at all, I used it\nthen.  Right out loud, I just begged the Lord to get after Mr. Pryor\nand make him behave like other people, and let the Princess come to our\nhouse, and for him to come too; because I liked him heaps when he was\nlion hunting, and I wanted to go with him again the worst way.  I had\nseen him sail right over the fences on his big black horse, and when he\ndid it in England, wearing a red coat, and the dogs flew over thick\naround him, it must have looked grand, but it was mighty hard on the\nfox.  I do hope it got away.  Anyway, I prayed as hard as I could, and\nevery time I said the strongest thing I knew, I punched Bobby to crow,\nand he never came out stronger.  Then I was Sister Dover and started:\n\"Oh come let us gather at the fountain, the fountain that never goes\ndry.\"\n\nJust as I was going to pronounce the benediction like father, I heard\nsomething, so I looked around, and there went he and Dr. Fenner.  They\nwere going toward the house, and yet, they hadn't passed me.  I was not\nscared, because I knew no one was sick.  Dr. Fenner always stopped when\nhe passed, if he had a minute, and if he hadn't, mother sent some one\nto the gate with buttermilk and slices of bread and butter, and jelly\nan inch thick.  When a meal was almost cooked she heaped some on a\nplate and he ate as he drove and left the plate next time he passed.\nOften he was so dead tired, he was asleep in his buggy, and his old\ngray horse always stopped at our gate.\n\nI ended with \"Amen,\" because I wanted to know if they had been\nlistening; so I climbed the fence, ran down the lane behind the bushes,\nand hid a minute.  Sure enough they had!  I suppose I had been so in\nearnest I hadn't heard a sound, but it's a wonder Hezekiah hadn't told\nme.  He was always seeing something to make danger signals about.  He\nnever let me run on a snake, or a hawk get one of the chickens, or\nPaddy Ryan come too close.  I only wanted to know if they had gone and\nlistened, and then I intended to run straight back to Bobby and\nHezekiah; but they stopped under the greening apple tree, and what they\nsaid was so interesting I waited longer than I should, because it's\nabout the worst thing you can do to listen when older people don't\nknow.  They were talking about me.\n\n\"I can't account for her,\" said father.\n\n\"I can!\" said Dr. Fenner.  \"She is the only child I ever have had in my\npractice who managed to reach earth as all children should.  During the\nimpressionable stage, no one expected her, so there was no time spent\nin worrying, fretting, and discontent.  I don't mean that these things\nwere customary with Ruth.  No woman ever accepted motherhood in a more\nbeautiful spirit; but if she would have protested at any time, it would\nhave been then.  Instead, she lived happily, naturally, and enjoyed\nherself as she never had before.  She was in the fields, the woods, and\nthe garden constantly, which accounts for this child's outdoor\ntendencies.  Then you must remember that both of you were at top notch\nintellectually, and physically, fully matured.  She had the benefit of\nripened minds, and at a time when every faculty recently had been\nstirred by the excitement and suffering of the war.  Oh, you can\naccount for her easily enough, but I don't know what on earth you are\ngoing to do with her.  You'll have to go careful, Paul.  I warn you she\nwill not be like the others.\"\n\n\"We realize that.  Mother says she doubts if she can ever teach her to\nsew and become a housewife.\"\n\n\"She isn't cut out for a seamstress or a housewife, Paul.  Tell Ruth\nnot to try to force those things on her.  Turn her loose out of doors;\ngive her good books, and leave her alone.  You won't be disappointed in\nthe woman who evolves.\"\n\nRight there I realized what I was doing, and I turned and ran for the\npulpit with all my might.  I could always repeat things, but I couldn't\nsee much sense to the first part of that; the last was as plain as the\nnose on your face.  Dr. Fenner said they mustn't force me to sew, and\ndo housework; and mother didn't mind the Almighty any better than she\ndid the doctor.  There was nothing in this world I disliked so much as\nbeing kept indoors, and made to hem cap and apron strings so\nparticularly that I had to count the number of threads between every\nstitch, and in each stitch, so that I got all of them just exactly\neven.  I liked carpet rags a little better, because I didn't have to be\nso particular about stitches, and I always picked out all the bright,\npretty colours.\n\nMother said she could follow my work all over the floor by the bright\nspots.  Perhaps if I were not to be kept in the house I wouldn't have\nto sew any more.  That made me so happy I wondered if I couldn't\nstretch out my arms and wave them and fly.  I sat on the pulpit wishing\nI had feathers.  It made me pretty blue to have to stay on the ground\nall the time, when I wanted to be sailing up among the clouds with the\nturkey buzzards.  It called to my mind that place in McGuffey's Fifth\nwhere it says:\n\n  \"Sweet bird, thy bower is ever green,\n   Thy sky is ever clear;\n   Thou hast no sorrow in thy song,\n   No winter in thy year.\"\n\n\nOf course, I never heard a turkey buzzard sing.  Laddie said they\ncouldn't; but that didn't prove it.  He said half the members of our\nchurch couldn't sing, but they DID; and when all of them were going at\nthe tops of their voices, it was just grand.  So maybe the turkey\nbuzzard could sing if it wanted to; seemed as if it should, if Isaac\nThomas could; and anyway, it was the next verse I was thinking most\nabout:\n\n  \"Oh, could I fly, I'd fly with thee!\n   We'd make with joyful wing,\n   Our annual visit o'er the globe,\n   Companions of the spring.\"\n\n\nThat was so exciting I thought I'd just try it, so I stood on the top\nrail, spread my arms, waved them, and started.  I was bumped in fifty\nplaces when I rolled into the cowslip bed at the foot of the steep\nhill, for stones stuck out all over the side of it, and I felt pretty\nmean as I climbed back to the pulpit.\n\nThe only consolation I had was what Dr. Fenner had said.  That would be\nthe greatest possible help in managing father or mother.\n\nI was undecided about whether I would go to school, or not.  Must be\nperfectly dreadful to dress like for church, and sit still in a stuffy\nlittle room, and do your \"abs,\" and \"bes,\" and \"bis,\" and \"bos,\" all\nday long.  I could spell quite well without looking at a schoolhouse,\nand read too.  I was wondering if I ever would go at all, when I\nthought of something else.  Dr. Fenner had said to give me plenty of\ngood books.  I was wild for some that were already promised me.  Well,\nwhat would they amount to if I couldn't understand them when I got\nthem?  THAT seemed to make it sure I would be compelled to go to school\nuntil I learned enough to understand what the books contained about\nbirds, flowers, and moths, anyway; and perhaps there would be some\nhaving Fairies in them.  Of course those would be interesting.\n\nI never hated doing anything so badly, in all my life, but I could see,\nwith no one to tell me, that I had put it off as long as I dared.  I\nwould just have to start school when Leon and May went in September.\nTilly Baher, who lived across the swamp near Sarah Hood, had gone two\nwinters already, and she was only a year older, and not half my size.\nI stood on the pulpit and looked a long time in every direction, into\nthe sky the longest of all.  It was settled.  I must go; I might as\nwell start and have it over.  I couldn't look anywhere, right there at\nhome, and not see more things I didn't know about than I did.  When\nmother showed me in the city, I wouldn't be snapped up like hot cakes;\nI'd be a blockhead no one would have.  It made me so vexed to think I\nhad to go, I set Hezekiah on my shoulder, took Bobby under my arm, and\nwent to the house.  On the way, I made up my mind that I would ask\nagain, very politely, to hold the little baby, and if the rest of them\nwent and pigged it up straight along, I'd pinch it, if I got a chance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe Last Day in Eden\n\n  \"'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,\n  And coming events cast their shadows before.\"\n\n\nOf course the baby was asleep and couldn't be touched; but there was\nsome excitement, anyway.  Father had come from town with a letter from\nthe new school teacher, that said she would expect him to meet her at\nthe station next Saturday.  Mother thought she might as well get the\nroom ready and let her stay at our house, because we were most\nconvenient, and it would be the best place for her.  She said that\nevery time, and the teacher always stayed with us.  Really it was\nbecause father and mother wanted the teacher where they could know as\nmuch as possible about what was going on.  Sally didn't like having her\nat all; she said with the wedding coming, the teacher would be a\nnuisance.  Shelley had finished our school, and the Groveville high\nschool, and instead of attending college she was going to Chicago to\nstudy music.  She was so anxious over her dresses and getting started,\nshe didn't seem to think much about what was going to happen to us at\nhome; so she didn't care if Miss Amelia stayed at our house.  May said\nit would be best to have the teacher with us, because she could help us\nwith our lessons at home, and we could get ahead of the others.  May\nalready had decided that she would be at the head of her class when she\nfinished school, and every time you wanted her and couldn't find her,\nif you would look across the foot of mother's bed, May would be there\nwith a spelling book.  Once she had spelled down our school, when\nLaddie was not there.\n\n\nFather had met Peter Dover in town, and he had said that he was coming\nto see Sally, because he had something of especial importance to tell\nher.\n\n\"Did he say what it was?\" asked Sally.\n\n\"Only what I have told you,\" replied father.\n\nSally wanted to take the broom and sweep the parlour.\n\n\"It's clean as a ribbon,\" said mother.\n\n\"If you go in there, you'll wake the baby,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Will it kill it if I do?\" asked Sally.\n\n\"No, but it will make it cross as fire, so it will cry all the time\nPeter is here,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"I'll be surprised if it doesn't scream every minute anyway,\" said\nSally.\n\n\"I hope it will,\" said Lucy.  \"That will make Peter think a while\nbefore he comes so often.\"\n\nThat made Sally so angry she couldn't speak, so she went out and began\nkilling chickens.  I helped her catch them.  They were so used to me\nthey would come right to my feet when I shelled corn.\n\n\"I'm going to kill three,\" said Sally.  \"I'm going to be sure we have\nenough, but don't you tell until their heads are off.\"\n\nWhile she was working on them mother came out and asked how many she\nhad, so Sally said three.  Mother counted us and said that wasn't\nenough; there would have to be four at least.\n\nAfter she was gone Sally looked at me and said:  \"Well, for land's\nsake!\"\n\nIt was so funny she had to laugh, and by the time I caught the fourth\none, and began helping pick them, she was over being provoked and we\nhad lots of fun.\n\nThe minute I saw Peter Dover he made me think of something.  I rode his\nhorse to the barn with Leon leading it.  There we saw Laddie.\n\n\"Guess what!\" I cried.\n\n\"Never could!\" laughed Laddie, giving Peter Dover's horse a slap as it\npassed him on the way to a stall.\n\n\"Four chickens, ham, biscuit, and cake!\" I announced.\n\n\"Is it a barbecue?\" asked Laddie.\n\n\"No, the extra one is for the baby,\" said Leon.  \"Squally little runt,\nI call it.\"\n\n\"It's a nice baby!\" said Laddie.\n\n\"What do you know about it?\" demanded Leon.\n\n\"Well, considering that I started with you, and have brought up two\nothers since, I am schooled in all there is to know,\" said Laddie.\n\n\"Guess what else!\" I cried.\n\n\"More?\" said Laddie.  \"Out with it!  Don't kill me with suspense.\"\n\n\"Father is going to town Saturday to meet the new teacher and she will\nstay at our house as usual.\"\n\nLeon yelled and fell back in a manger, while Laddie held harness oil to\nhis nose.\n\n\"More!\" cried Leon, grabbing the bottle.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" asked Laddie of me earnestly.\n\n\"It's decided.  Mother said so,\" I told him.\n\n\"Name of a black cat, why?\" demanded Laddie.\n\n\"Mother said we were most convenient for the teacher.\"\n\n\"Aren't there enough of us?\" asked Leon, straightening up sniffing\nharness oil as if his life depended on it.\n\n\"Any unprejudiced person would probably say so to look in,\" said Laddie.\n\n\"I'll bet she'll be sixty and a cat,\" said Leon.  \"Won't I have fun\nwith her?\"\n\n\"Maybe so, maybe not!\" said Laddie.  \"You can't always tell, for sure.\nRemember your Alamo!  You were going to have fun with the teacher last\nyear, but she had it with you.\"\n\nLeon threw the oil bottle at him.  Laddie caught it and set it on the\nshelf.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Leon.\n\n\"I do,\" said Laddie dryly.  \"THIS is one reason.\"  He hit Peter Dover's\nhorse another slap.\n\n\"Maybe yes,\" said Leon.\n\n\"Shelley to music school, two.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Leon.  \"Peter Dovers are the greatest expense, and Peter\nwon't happen but once.  Shelley will have at least two years in school\nbefore it is her turn, and you come next, anyway.\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" cried Laddie.\n\n\"Thanky!  Your orders shall be obeyed gladly.\"\n\nHe laid down the pitchfork, went outside, closed the door, and latched\nit.  Laddie called to him, but he ran to the house.  When Laddie and I\nfinished our work, and his, and wanted to go, we had to climb the\nstairs and leave through the front door on the embankment.\n\n\"The monkey!\" said Laddie, but he didn't get mad; he just laughed.\n\nThe minute I stepped into the house and saw the parlour door closed, I\nthought of that \"something\" again.  I walked past it, but couldn't hear\nanything.  Of course mother wanted to know; and she would be very\nthankful to me if I could tell her.  I went out the front door, and\nthought deeply on the situation.  The windows were wide open, but I was\nfar below them and I could only hear a sort of murmur.  Why can't\npeople speak up loud and plain, anyway?  Of course they would sit on\nthe big haircloth sofa.  Didn't Leon call it the \"sparking bench\"?  The\nhemlock tree would be best.  I climbed quieter than a cat, for they\nbreak bark and make an awful scratching with their claws sometimes; my\nbare feet were soundless.  Up and up I went, slowly, for it was\ndreadfully rough.  They were not on the sofa.  I could see plainly\nthrough the needles.  Then I saw the spruce would have been better, for\nthey were standing in front of the parlour door and Peter had one hand\non the knob.  His other arm was around my sister Sally.  Breathlessly I\nleaned as far as I could, and watched.\n\n\"Father said he'd give me the money to buy a half interest, and furnish\na house nicely, if you said 'yes,' Sally,\" said Peter.\n\nSally leaned back all pinksome and blushful, and while she laughed at\nhim she\n\n  \"Carelessly tossed off a curl\n   That played on her delicate brow.\"\n\nexactly like Mary Dow in McGuffey's Third.\n\n\"Well, what did I SAY?\" she asked.\n\n\"Come to think of it, you didn't say anything.\"\n\nSally's face was all afire with dancing lights, and she laughed the\ngayest little laugh.\n\n\"Are you so very sure of that, Peter?\" she said.\n\n\"I'm not sure of anything,\" said Peter, \"except that I am so happy I\ncould fly.\"\n\n\"Try it, fool!\" I said to myself, deep in my throat.\n\nSally laughed again, and Peter took his other hand from the door and\nput that arm around Sally too, and he drew her to him and kissed her,\nthe longest, hardest kiss I ever saw.  I let go and rolled, tumbled,\nslid, and scratched down the hemlock tree, dropped from the last branch\nto the ground, and scampered around the house.  I reached the\ndining-room door when every one was gathering for supper.\n\n\"Mother!\" I cried.  \"Mother!  Yes!  They're engaged!  He's kissing her,\nmother!  Yes, Lucy, they're engaged!\"\n\nI rushed in to tell all of them what they would be glad to know, and if\nthere didn't stand Peter and Sally!  How they ever got through that\ndoor, and across the sitting-room before me, I don't understand.  Sally\nmade a dive at me, and I was so astonished I forgot to run, so she\ncaught me.  She started for the wood house with me, and mother\nfollowed.  Sally turned at the door and she was the whitest of anything\nyou ever saw.\n\n\"This is my affair,\" she said.  \"I'll attend to this young lady.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said mother, and as I live she turned and left me to my\nsad fate, as it says in a story book we have.  I wish when people are\ngoing to punish me, they'd take a switch and strike respectably, like\nmother does.  This thing of having some one get all over me, and not\nhaving an idea where I'm going to be hit, is the worst punishment that\nI ever had.  I'd been down the hill and up the hemlock that day,\nanyway.  I'd always been told Sally didn't want me.  She PROVED it\nright then.  Finally she quit, because she was too tired to strike\nagain, so I crept among the shavings on the work bench and went to\nsleep.  I THOUGHT they would like to know, and that I was going to\nplease them.\n\nAnyway, they found out, for by the time Sally got back Peter had told\nthem about the store, and the furnished house, and asked father for\nSally right before all of them, which father said was pretty brave; but\nPeter knew it was all right or he couldn't have come like he'd been\ndoing.\n\nAfter that, you couldn't hear anything at our house but wedding.\nSally's share of linen and bedding was all finished long ago.  Father\ntook her to Fort Wayne on the cars to buy her wedding, travelling, and\nworking dresses, and her hat, cloak, and linen, like you have when you\nmarry.\n\nIt was strange that Sally didn't want mother to go, but she said the\ntrip would tire her too much.  Mother said it was because Sally could\ncoax more dresses from father.  Anyway, mother told him to set a limit\nand stick to it.  She said she knew he hadn't done it as she got the\nfirst glimpse of Sally's face when they came back, but the child looked\nso beautiful and happy she hadn't the heart to spoil her pleasure.\n\nThe next day a sewing woman came; and all of them were shut up in the\nsitting-room, while the sewing machine just whizzed on the working\ndresses.  Sally said the wedding dress had to be made by hand.  She\nkept the room locked, and every new thing that they made was laid away\non the bed in the parlour bedroom, and none of us had a peep until\neverything was finished.  It was awfully exciting, but I wouldn't\npretend I cared, because I was huffy at her.  I told her I wouldn't\nkiss her goodbye, and I'd be GLAD when she was gone.\n\nSally said the school-ma'am simply had to go to Winters', or some place\nelse, but mother said possibly a stranger would have some ideas, and\nknow some new styles, so Sally then thought maybe they had better try\nit a few days, and she could have her place and be company when she and\nShelley left.  Shelley was rather silent and blue, and before long I\nfound her crying, because mother had told her she couldn't start for\nChicago until after the wedding, and that would make her miss six weeks\nat the start.\n\nNext day word was sent around that school was to begin the coming\nMonday; so Saturday afternoon the people who had children large enough\nto go sent the biggest of them to clean the schoolhouse.  May, Leon,\nand I went to do our share.  Just when there were about a bushel of nut\nshells, and withered apple cores, and inky paper on the floor, the\nblackboard half cleaned, and ashes trailed deep between the stove and\nthe window Billy Wilson was throwing them from, some one shouted:\n\"There comes Mr. Stanton with Her.\"\n\nAll of us dropped everything and ran to the south windows.  I tell you\nI was proud of our big white team as it came prancing down the hill,\nand the gleaming patent leather trimmings, and the brass side lamps\nshining in the sun.  Father sat very straight, driving rather fast, as\nif he would as lief get it over with, and instead of riding on the back\nseat, where mother always sat, the teacher was in front beside him, and\nshe seemed to be talking constantly.  We looked at each other and\ngroaned when father stopped at the hitching post and got out.  If we\nhad tried to see what a dreadful muss we could make, things could have\nlooked no worse.  I think father told her to wait in the carriage, but\nwe heard her cry:  \"Oh Mr. Stanton, let me see the dear children I'm to\nteach, and where I'm to work.\"\n\nHopped is the word.  She hopped from the carriage and came hopping\nafter father.  She was as tall as a clothes prop and scarcely as fat.\nThere were gray hairs coming on her temples.  Her face was sallow and\nwrinkled, and she had faded, pale-blue eyes.  Her dress was like my\nmother had worn several years before, in style, and of stiff gray\nstuff.  She made me feel that no one wanted her at home, and probably\nthat was the reason she had come so far away.\n\nEvery one stood dumb.  Mother always went to meet people and May was\nold enough to know it.  She went, but she looked exactly as she does\nwhen the wafer bursts and the quinine gets in her mouth, and she\ndoesn't dare spit it out, because it costs five dollars a bottle, and\nit's going to do her good.  Father introduced May and some of the older\nchildren, and May helped him with the others, and then he told us to\n\"dig in and work like troopers,\" and he would take Miss Pollard on home.\n\n\"Oh do let me remain and help the dear children!\" she cried.\n\n\"We can finish!\" we answered in full chorus.\n\n\"How lovely of you!\" she chirped.\n\nChirp makes you think of a bird; and in speech and manner Miss Amelia\nPollard was the most birdlike of any human being I ever have seen.  She\nhopped from the step to the walk, turned to us, her head on one side,\nplayfulness in the air around her, and shook her finger at us.\n\n\"Be extremely particular that you leave things immaculate at the\nconsummation of your labour,\" she said.  \"'Remember that cleanliness is\nnext to Godliness!'\"\n\n\"Two terms of that!\" gasped Leon, sinking on the stove hearth.  \"Behold\nJob mourning as close the ashes as he can.\"\n\nBilly Wilson had the top lid off, so he reached down and got a big\nhandful of ashes and sifted them over Leon.  But it's no fun to do\nanything like that to him; he only sank in a more dejected heap, and\nmoaned:  \"Send for Bildad and Zophar to comfort me, and more ashes,\nplease.\"\n\n\"Why does the little feathered dear touch earth at all?  Why doesn't\nshe fly?\" demanded Silas Shaw.\n\n\"I'm going to get a hundred wads ready for Monday,\" said Jimmy Hood.\n\"We can shoot them when we please.\"\n\n\"Bet ten cents you can't hit her,\" said Billy Wilson.  \"There ain't\nenough of her for a decent mark.\"\n\n\"Let's quit and go home,\" proposed Leon.  \"This will look worse than it\ndoes now by Monday night.\"\n\nThen every one began talking at once.  Suddenly May seized the poker\nand began pounding on the top of the stove for order.\n\n\"We must clean this up,\" she said.  \"We might as well finish.  Maybe\nyou'll shoot wads and do what you please, and maybe you won't.  Her\neyes went around like a cat that smells mice.  If she can spell the\nlanguage she uses, she is the best we've ever had.\"\n\nThat made us blink, and I never forgot it.  Many times afterward while\nlistening to people talk, I wondered if they could spell the words they\nused.\n\n\"Well, come on, then!\" said Leon.  He seized the broom and handed it to\nBilly Wilson, quoting as he did so, \"Work, work, my boy, be not\nafraid\"; and he told Silas Shaw as he gave him the mop, to \"Look labour\nboldly in the face!\" but he never did a thing himself, except to keep\nevery one laughing.\n\nSo we cleaned up as well as we could, and Leon strutted like Bobby,\nbecause he locked the door and carried the key.  When we reached home I\nwas sorry I hadn't gone with father, so I could have seen mother,\nSally, Candace, and Laddie when first they met the new teacher.  The\nshock showed yet!  Miss Amelia had taken off her smothery woollen dress\nand put on a black calico, but it wasn't any more cheerful.  She didn't\nknow what to do, and you could see plainly that no one knew what to do\nwith her, so they united in sending me to show her the place.  I asked\nher what she would like most to see, and she said everything was so\ncharming she couldn't decide.  I thought if she had no more choice than\nthat, one place would do as well as another, so I started for the\norchard.  Quick as we got there, I knew what to do.  I led her straight\nto our best cling peach tree, told her to climb on the fence so she\ncould reach easily, and eat all she chose.  We didn't dare shake the\ntree, because the pigs ran on the other side of the fence, and they\nchanked up every peach that fell there.  Those peaches were too good to\nfeed even father's finest Berkshires.\n\nBy the time Miss Amelia had eaten nine or ten, she was so happy to\nthink she was there, she quit tilting her head and using big words.  Of\ncourse she couldn't know how I loved to hear them, and maybe she\nthought I wouldn't know what they meant, and that they would be wasted\non me.  If she had understood how much spelling and defining I'd heard\nin my life, I guess she might have talked up as big as she could, and\nstill I'd have got most of it.  When she reached the place where she\nate more slowly, she began to talk.  She must have asked me most a\nhundred questions.  What all our names were, how old we were, if our\ngirls had lots of beaus, and if there were many men in the\nneighbourhood, and dozens of things my mother never asked any one.  She\nalways inquired if people were well, if their crops were growing, how\nmuch fruit they had, and how near their quilts were finished.\n\nI told her all about Sally and the wedding, because no one cared who\nknew it, after I had been pounded to mince-meat for telling.  She asked\nif Shelley had any beaus, and I said there wasn't any one who came like\nPeter, but every man in the neighbourhood wanted to be her beau.  Then\nshe asked about Laddie, and I was taking no risks, so I said:  \"I only\nsee him at home.  I don't know where he goes when he's away.  You'll\nhave to ask him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I never would dare,\" she said.  \"But he must.  He is so handsome!\nThe girls would just compel him to go to see them.\"\n\n\"Not if he didn't want to go,\" I said.\n\n\"You must never, never tell him I said so, but I do think he is the\nhandsomest man I ever saw.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" I said, \"and it wouldn't make any difference if I told him.\"\n\n\"Then do you mean you're going to tell him my foolish remark?\" she\ngiggled.\n\n\"No use,\" I said.  \"He knows it now.  Every time he parts his hair he\nsees how good looking he is.  He doesn't care.  He says the only thing\nthat counts with a man is to be big, strong, manly, and well educated.\"\n\n\"Is he well educated?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so, as far as he's gone,\" I answered.  \"Of course he will\ngo on being educated every day of his life, same as father.  He says it\nis all rot about 'finishing' your education.  You never do.  You learn\nmore important things each day, and by the time you are old enough to\ndie, you have almost enough sense to know how to live comfortably.\nPity, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Amelia, \"it's an awful pity, but it's the truth.  Is\nyour mother being educated too?\"\n\n\"Whole family,\" I said.  \"We learn all the time, mother most of any,\nbecause father always looks out for her.  You see, it takes so much of\nher time to manage the house, and sew, and knit, and darn, that she\ncan't study so much as the others; so father reads all the books to\nher, and tells her about everything he finds out, and so do all of us.\nJust ask her if you think she doesn't know things.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know what to ask,\" said Miss Amelia.\n\n\"Ask how long it took to make this world, who invented printing, where\nEnglish was first spoken, why Greeley changed his politics, how to make\nbluebell perfumery, cut out a dress, or cure a baby of worms.  Just ask\nher!\"\n\nMiss Amelia threw a peach stone through a fence crack and hit a pig.\nIt was a pretty neat shot.\n\n\"I don't need ask any of that,\" she said scornfully.  \"I know all of it\nnow.\"\n\n\"All right!  What is best for worms?\" I asked.\n\n\"Jayne's vermifuge,\" said Miss Amelia.\n\n\"Wrong!\" I cried.  \"That's a patent medicine.  Tea made from male fern\nroot is best, because there's no morphine in it!\"\n\nThe supper bell rang and I was glad of it.  Peaches are not very\nfilling after all, for I couldn't see but that Miss Amelia ate as much\nas any of us.  For a few minutes every one was slow in speaking, then\nmother asked about cleaning the schoolhouse, Laddie had something to\nexplain to father about corn mould, Sally and the dressmaker talked\nabout pipings--not a bird--a new way to fold goods to make trimmings,\nand soon everything was going on the same as if the new teacher were\nnot there.  I noticed that she kept her head straight, and was not\nnearly so glib-tongued and birdlike before mother and Sally as she had\nbeen at the schoolhouse.  Maybe that was why father told mother that\nnight that the new teacher would bear acquaintance.\n\nSunday was like every other Sabbath, except that I felt so sad all day\nI could have cried, but I was not going to do it.  Seemed as if I never\ncould put on shoes, and so many clothes Monday morning, quite like\nchurch, and be shut in a room for hours, to try to learn what was in\nbooks, when the world was running over with things to find out where\nyou could have your feet in water, leaves in your hair, and little\nliving creatures in your hands.  In the afternoon Miss Amelia asked\nLaddie to take her for a walk to see the creek, and the barn, and he\ncouldn't escape.\n\nI suppose our barn was exactly like hundreds of others.  It was built\nagainst an embankment so that on one side you could drive right on the\nthreshing floor with big loads of grain.  On the sunny side in the\nlower part were the sheep pens, cattle stalls, and horse mangers.  It\nwas always half bursting with overflowing grain bins and haylofts in\nthe fall; the swallows twittered under the roof until time to go south\nfor winter, as they sailed from the ventilators to their nests\nplastered against the rafters or eaves.  The big swinging doors front\nand back could be opened to let the wind blow through in a strong\ndraft.  From the east doors you could see for miles across the country.\n\nI said our barn was like others, but it was not.  There was not another\nlike it in the whole world.  Father, the boys, and the hired men always\nkept it cleaned and in proper shape every day.  The upper floor was as\nneat as some women's houses.  It was swept, the sun shone in, the winds\ndrifted through, the odours of drying hay and grain were heavy, and\nfrom the top of the natural little hill against which it stood you\ncould see for miles in all directions.\n\nThe barn was our great playhouse on Sundays.  It was clean there, we\nwere where we could be called when wanted, and we liked to climb the\nladders to the top of the haymows, walk the beams to the granaries, and\njump to the hay.  One day May came down on a snake that had been\nbrought in with a load.  I can hear her yell now, and it made her so\nfrantic she's been killing them ever since.  It was only a harmless\nlittle garter snake, but she was so surprised.\n\nMiss Amelia held her head very much on one side all the time she walked\nwith Laddie, and she was so birdlike Leon slipped him a brick and told\nhim to have her hold it to keep her down.  Seemed as if she might fly\nany minute.  She thought our barn was the nicest she ever had seen and\nthe cleanest.  When Laddie opened the doors on the east side, and she\ncould see the big, red, yellow, and green apples thick as leaves on the\ntrees in the orchard, the lane, the woods pasture, and the meadow with\nscattering trees, two running springs, and the meeting of the creeks,\nshe said it was the loveliest sight she ever saw--I mean beheld.\nLaddie liked that, so he told her about the beautiful town, and the\nlake, and the Wabash River, that our creek emptied into, and how people\ncame from other states and big cities and stayed all summer to fish,\nrow, swim, and have good times.\n\nShe asked him to take her to the meadow, but he excused himself,\nbecause he had an engagement.  So she stood in the door, and watched\nhim saddle Flos and start to the house to dress in his riding clothes.\nAfter that she didn't care a thing about the meadow, so we went back.\n\nOur house looked as if we had a party. We were all dressed in our best,\nand every one was out in the yard, garden, or orchard.  Peter and Sally\nwere under the big pearmain apple tree at the foot of the orchard,\nShelley and a half dozen beaus were everywhere.  May had her spelling\nbook in one hand and was in my big catalpa talking to Billy Stevens,\nwho was going to be her beau as soon as mother said she was old enough.\nFather was reading a wonderful new book to mother and some of the\nneighbours.  Leon was perfectly happy because no one wanted him, so he\ncould tease all of them by saying things they didn't like to hear.\nWhen Laddie came out and mounted, Leon asked him where he was going,\nand Laddie said he hadn't fully decided: he might ride to Elizabeth's,\nand not come back until Monday morning.\n\n\"You think you're pretty slick,\" said Leon.  \"But if we could see north\nto the cross road we could watch you turn west, and go past Pryors to\nshow yourself off, or try to find the Princess on the road walking or\nriding.  I know something I'm saving to tell next time you get smart,\nMr. Laddie.\"\n\nLaddie seemed annoyed and no one was quicker to see it than Leon.\n\nInstantly he jumped on the horse block, pulled down his face long as he\ncould, stretched his hands toward Laddie, and making his voice all\nwavery and tremulous, he began reciting from \"Lochiel's Warning,\" in\ntones of agonizing pleading:\n\n  \"Laddie, Laddie, beware of the day!\n   For, dark and despairing, my sight, I may seal,\n   But man cannot cover what God would reveal;\n   'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,\n   And coming events cast their shadows before.\"\n\n\nThat scared me.  I begged Leon to tell, but he wouldn't say a word\nmore.  He went and talked to Miss Amelia as friendly as you please, and\nasked her to take a walk in the orchard and get some peaches, and she\nwent flying.  He got her all she could carry and guided her to Peter\nand Sally, introduced her to Peter, and then slipped away and left her.\nThen he and Sally couldn't talk about their wedding, and Peter couldn't\nsqueeze her hand, and she couldn't fix his tie, and it was awful.\nShelley and her boys almost laughed themselves sick over it, and then\nshe cried, \"To the rescue!\" and started, so they followed.  They\ncaptured Miss Amelia and brought her back, and left her with father and\nthe wonderful book, but I'm sure she liked the orchard better.\n\nI took Grace Greenwood under my arm, Hezekiah on my shoulder, and with\nBobby at my heels went away.  I didn't want my hair pulled, or to be\nteased that day.  There was such a hardness around my heart, and such a\nlump in my throat, that I didn't care what happened to me one minute,\nand the next I knew I'd slap any one who teased me, if I were sent to\nbed for it.  As I went down the lane Peter called to me to come and see\nhim, but I knew exactly how he looked, and didn't propose to make up.\nThere was not any sense in Sally clawing me all over, when I only tried\nto help mother and Lucy find out what they wanted to know so badly.  I\nwent down the hill, crossed the creek on the stepping-stones, and\nfollowed the cowpath into the woods pasture.  It ran beside the creek\nbank through the spice thicket and blackberry patches, under pawpaw\ngroves, and beneath giant oaks and elms.  Just where the creek turned\nat the open pasture, below the church and cemetery, right at the deep\nbend, stood the biggest white oak father owned.  It was about a tree\nexactly like this that an Englishman wrote a beautiful poem in\nMcGuffey's Sixth, that begins:\n\n  \"A song to the oak, the brave old oak,\n   Who hath ruled in the greenwood long;\n   Here's health and renown to his broad green crown,\n   And his fifty arms so strong.\"\n\n\nI knew it was the same, because I counted the arms time and again, and\nthere were exactly fifty.  There was a pawpaw and spice hedge around\nthree sides of this one, and water on the other.  Wild grapes climbed\nfrom the bushes to the lower branches and trailed back to earth again.\nHere, I had two secrets I didn't propose to tell.  One was that in the\ncrotch of some tiptop branches the biggest chicken hawks you ever saw\nhad their nest, and if they took too many chickens father said they'd\nhave to be frightened a little with a gun.  I can't begin to tell how I\nloved those hawks.  They did the one thing I wanted to most, and never\ncould.  When I saw them serenely soar above the lowest of the soft\nfleecy September clouds, I was wild with envy.  I would have gone\nwithout chicken myself rather than have seen one of those splendid big\nbrown birds dropped from the skies.  I was so careful to shield them,\nthat I selected this for my especial retreat when I wanted most to be\nalone, and I carefully gathered up any offal from the nest that might\npoint out their location, and threw it into the water where it ran the\nswiftest.\n\nI parted the vines and crept where the roots of the big oak stretched\nlike bony fingers over the water, that was slowly eating under it and\nbaring its roots.  I sat on them above the water and thought.  I had\ndecided the day before about my going to school, and the day before\nthat, and many, many times before that, and here I was having to settle\nit all over again.  Doubled on the sak roots, a troubled little soul, I\nsettled it once more.\n\nNo books or teachers were needed to tell me about flowing water and\nfish, how hawks raised their broods and kept house, about the softly\ncooing doves of the spice thickets, the cuckoos slipping snakelike in\nand out of the wild crab-apple bushes, or the brown thrush's weird call\nfrom the thorn bush.  I knew what they said and did, but their names,\nwhere they came from, where they went when the wind blew and the snow\nfell--how was I going to find out that?  Worse yet were the flowers,\nbutterflies, and moths; they were mysteries past learning alone, and\nwhile the names I made up for them were pretty and suitable, I knew in\nall reason they wouldn't be the same in the books.  I had to go, but no\none will ever know what it cost.  When the supper bell rang, I sat\nstill.  I'd have to wait until at least two tables had been served,\nanyway, so I sat there and nursed my misery, looked and listened, and\nby and by I felt better.  I couldn't see or hear a thing that was\nstanding still.  Father said even the rocks grew larger year by year.\nThe trees were getting bigger, the birds were busy, and the creek was\nin a dreadful hurry to reach the river.  It was like that poetry piece\nthat says:\n\n  \"When a playful brook, you gambolled,\"\n\n(Mostly that gambolled word is said about lambs)\n\n    \"And the sunshine o'er you smiled,\n  On your banks did children loiter,\n    Looking for the spring flowers wild?\"\n\n\nThe creek was more in earnest and working harder at pushing steadily\nahead without ever stopping than anything else; and like the poetry\npiece again, it really did \"seem to smile upon us as it quickly passed\nus by.\"  I had to quit playing, and go to work some time; it made me\nsorry to think how behind I was, because I had not started two years\nbefore, when I should.  But that couldn't be helped now.  All there was\nleft was to go this time, for sure.  I got up heavily and slowly as an\nold person, and then slipped out and ran down the path to the meadow,\nbecause I could hear Leon whistle as he came to bring the cows.\n\nBy fast running I could start them home for him:  Rose, Brindle, Bess,\nand Pidy, Sukey and Muley; they had eaten all day, but they still\nsnatched bites as they went toward the gate.  I wanted to surprise Leon\nand I did.\n\n\"Getting good, ain't you?\" he asked.  \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Nothing!\" I said.  \"I just heard you coming and I thought I'd help\nyou.\"\n\n\"Where were you?\"\n\n\"Playing.\"\n\n\"You don't look as if you'd been having much fun.\"\n\n\"I don't expect ever to have any, after I begin school.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Leon.  \"It is kind of tough the first day or two, but you'll\nsoon get over it.  You should have behaved yourself, and gone when they\nstarted you two years ago.\"\n\n\"Think I don't know it?\"\n\nLeon stopped and looked at me sharply.\n\n\"I'll help you nights, if you want me to,\" he offered.\n\n\"Can I ever learn?\" I asked, almost ready to cry.\n\n\"Of course you can,\" said Leon.  \"You're smart as the others, I\nsuppose.  The sevens and nines of the multiplication table are the\nstickers, but you ought to do them if other girls can.  You needn't\nfeel bad because you are behind a little to start on; you are just that\nmuch better prepared to work, and you can soon overtake them.  You know\na lot none of the rest of us do, and some day it will come your turn to\nshow off.  Cheer up, you'll be all right.\"\n\nMen are such a comfort.  I pressed closer for more.\n\n\"Do you suppose I will?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Leon.  \"Any minute the woods, or birds, or flowers\nare mentioned your time will come; and all of us will hear you read and\nhelp nights.  I'd just as soon as not.\"\n\nThat was the most surprising thing.  He never offered to help me\nbefore.  He never acted as if he cared what became of me.  Maybe it was\nbecause Laddie always had taken such good care of me, Leon had no\nchance.  He seemed willing enough now.  I looked at him closely.\n\n\"You'll find out I'll learn things if I try,\" I boasted.  \"And you will\nfind out I don't tell secrets either.\"\n\n\"I've been waiting for you to pipe up about----\"\n\n\"Well, I haven't piped, have I?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"I am not going to either.\"\n\n\"I almost believe you.  A girl you could trust would be a funny thing\nto see.\"\n\n\"Tell me what you know about Laddie, and see if I'm funny.\"\n\n\"You'd telltale sure as life!\"\n\n\"Well, if you know it, he knows it anyway.\"\n\n\"He doesn't know WHAT I know.\"\n\n\"Well, be careful and don't worry mother.  You know how she is since\nthe fever, and father says all of us must think of her.  If it's\nanything that would bother her, don't tell before her.\"\n\n\"Say, looky here,\" said Leon, turning on me sharply, \"is all this\nsudden consideration for mother or are you legging for Laddie?\"\n\n\"For both,\" I answered stoutly.\n\n\"Mostly for Laddie, just the same.  You can't fool me, missy.  I won't\ntell you one word.\"\n\n\"You needn't!\" I answered, \"I don't care!\"\n\n\"Yes you do,\" he said.  \"You'd give anything to find out what I know,\nand then run to Laddie with it, but you can't fool me.  I'm too smart\nfor you.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said.  \"You go and tell anything on Laddie, and I'll\nwatch you, and first trick I catch you at, I'll do some telling myself,\nSmarty.\"\n\n\"That's a game more than one can play at,\" said Leon.  \"Go ahead!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe First Day of School\n\n  \"Birds in their little nests agree.\n  And why can't we?\"\n\n\n\"B-i-r-d-s, birds, i-n, in, t-h-e-i-r, their, l-i-t-t-l-e, little,\nn-e-s-t-s, nests, a-g-r-e-e, agree.\"\n\nMy feet burned in my new shoes, but most of my body was chilling as I\nstood beside Miss Amelia on the platform, before the whole school, and\nfollowed the point of her pencil, while, a letter at a time, I spelled\naloud my first sentence.  Nothing ever had happened to me as bad as\nthat.  I was not used to so much clothing.  It was like taking a colt\nfrom the woods pasture and putting it into harness for the first time.\nThat lovely September morning I followed Leon and May down the dusty\nroad, my heart sick with dread.\n\nMay was so much smaller that I could have picked her up and carried\nher.  She was a gentle, loving little thing, until some one went too\nfar, and then they got what they deserved, all at once and right away.\n\nMany of the pupils were waiting before the church.  Leon climbed the\nsteps, made a deep bow, waved toward the school building across the\nway, and what he intended to say was, \"Still sits the schoolhouse by\nthe road,\" but he was a little excited and the s's doubled his tongue,\nso that we heard:  \"Shill stits the schoolhouse by the road.\"  We just\nyelled and I forgot a little about myself.\n\nWhen Miss Amelia came to the door and rang the bell, May must have\nremembered something of how her first day felt, for as we reached the\nsteps she waited for me, took me in with her, and found me a seat.  If\nshe had not, I'm quite sure I'd have run away and fought until they\nleft me in freedom, as I had two years before.  All forenoon I had\nshivered in my seat, while classes were arranged, and the elder pupils\nwere started on their work; then Miss Amelia called me to her on the\nplatform and tried to find out how much schooling I had.  I was ashamed\nthat I knew so little, but there was no sense in her making me spell\nafter a pencil, like a baby.  I'd never seen the book she picked up.  I\ncould read the line she pointed to, and I told her so, but she said to\nspell the words; so I thought she had to be obeyed, for one poetry\npiece I know says:\n\n  \"Quickly speed your steps to school\n   And there mind your teacher's rule.\"\n\n\nI can see Miss Amelia to-day.  Her pale face was lined deeper than\never, her drab hair was dragged back tighter.  She wore a black calico\ndress with white huckleberries, and a white calico apron figured in\nlarge black apples, each having a stem and two leaves.  In dress she\nwas a fruitful person.  She had been a surprise to all of us.  Chipper\nas a sparrow, she had hopped, and chattered, and darted here and there,\nuntil the hour of opening.  Then in the stress of arranging classes and\ngetting started, all her birdlike ways slipped from her.  Stern and\nbony she stood before us, and with a cold light in her pale eyes, she\nbegan business in a manner that made Johnny Hood forget all about his\npaper wads, and Leon commenced studying like a good boy, and never even\ntried to have fun with her.  Every one was so surprised you could\nnotice it, except May, and she looked, \"I told you so!\" even in the\nback.  She had a way of doing that very thing as I never saw any one\nelse.  From the set of her head, how she carried her shoulders, the\nstiffness of her spine, and her manner of walking, if you knew her\nwell, you could tell what she thought, the same as if you saw her face.\n\nI followed that pencil point and in a husky voice repeated the letters.\nI could see Tillie Baher laughing at me from behind her geography, and\nevery one else had stopped what they were doing to watch and listen, so\nI forgot to be thankful that I even knew my a b c's.  I spelled through\nthe sentence, pronounced the words and repeated them without much\nthought as to the meaning; at that moment it didn't occur to me that\nshe had chosen the lesson because father had told her how I made\nfriends with the birds.  The night before he had been putting me\nthrough memory tests, and I had recited poem after poem, even long ones\nin the Sixth Reader, and never made one mistake when the piece was\nabout birds.  At our house, we heard next day's lessons for all ages\ngone over every night so often, that we couldn't help knowing them by\nheart, if we had any brains at all, and I just loved to get the big\nfolk's readers and learn the bird pieces.  Father had been telling her\nabout it, so for that reason she thought she would start me on the\nbirds, but I'm sure she made me spell after a pencil point, like a\nbaby, on purpose to shame me, because I was two years behind the others\nwho were near my age.  As I repeated the line Miss Amelia thought she\nsaw her chance.  She sprang to her feet, tripped a few steps toward the\ncentre of the platform, and cried:  \"Classes, attention!  Our Youngest\nPupil has just completed her first sentence.  This sentence contains a\nThought.  It is a wonderfully beautiful Thought.  A Thought that\nsuggests a great moral lesson for each of us.  'Birrrds--in their\nlittle nests--agreeee.'\"\n\nNever have I heard cooing sweetness to equal the melting tones in which\nMiss Amelia drawled those words.  Then she continued, after a good long\npause in order to give us time to allow the \"Thought\" to sink in:\n\"There is a lesson in this for all of us.  We are here in our\nschoolroom, like little birds in their nest.  Now how charming it would\nbe if all of us would follow the example of the birds, and at our work,\nand in our play, agreeee--be kind, loving, and considerate of each\nother.  Let us all remember always this wonderful truth:  'Birrrrds--in\ntheir little nests--agreeeee!'\"\n\nIn three steps I laid hold of her apron.  Only last night Leon had said\nit would come, yet whoever would have thought that I'd get a chance\nlike this, so soon.\n\n\"Ho but they don't!\" I cried.  \"They fight like anything!  Every day\nthey make the feathers fly!\"\n\nIn a backward stroke Miss Amelia's fingers, big and bony, struck my\ncheek a blow that nearly upset me.  A red wave crossed her face, and\nher eyes snapped.  I never had been so surprised in all my life.  I was\nonly going to tell her the truth.  What she had said was altogether\nfalse.  Ever since I could remember I had watched courting male birds\nfight all over the farm.  After a couple had paired, and were nest\nbuilding, the father always drove every other bird from his location.\nIn building I had seen him pecked for trying to place a twig.  I had\nseen that happen again for merely offering food to the mother, if she\ndidn't happen to be hungry, or for trying to make love to her when she\nwas brooding.  If a young bird failed to get the bite it wanted, it\nsometimes grabbed one of its nestmates by the bill, or the eye even,\nand tried to swallow it whole.  Always the oldest and strongest climbed\non top of the youngest and fooled his mammy into feeding him most by\nhaving his head highest, his mouth widest, and begging loudest.  There\ncould be no mistake.  I was so amazed I forgot the blow, as I stared at\nthe fool woman.\n\n\"I don't see why you slap me!\" I cried.  \"It's the truth!  Lots of\ntimes old birds pull out bunches of feathers fighting, and young ones\nin the nests bite each other until they squeal.\"\n\nMiss Amelia caught my shoulders and shook me as hard as she could; and\nshe proved to be stronger than you ever would have thought to look at\nher.\n\n\"Take your seat!\" she cried.  \"You are a rude, untrained child!\"\n\n\"They do fight!\" I insisted, as I held my head high and walked to my\ndesk.\n\nLeon laughed out loud, and that made everyone else.  Miss Amelia had so\nmuch to do for a few minutes that she forgot me, and I know now why\nLeon started it, at least partly.  He said afterward it was the\nfunniest sight he ever saw.  My cheek smarted and burned.  I could\nscarcely keep from feeling to learn whether it were swelling, but I\nwouldn't have shed a tear or raised my hand for anything you could\noffer.\n\nRecess was coming and I didn't know what to do.  If I went to the\nplayground, all of them would tease me; and if I sat at my desk Miss\nAmelia would have another chance at me.  That was too much to risk, so\nI followed the others outdoors, and oh joy! there came Laddie down the\nroad.  He set me on one of the posts of the hitching rack before the\nchurch, and with my arms around his neck, I sobbed out the whole story.\n\n\"She didn't understand,\" said Laddie quietly.  \"You stay here until I\ncome back.  I'll go explain to her about the birds.  Perhaps she hasn't\nwatched them as closely as you have.\"\n\nRecess was over before he returned.  He had wet his handkerchief at the\nwater bucket, and now he bathed my face and eyes, straightened my hair\nwith his pocket comb, and began unlacing my shoes.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" I asked.  \"I must wear them.  All the girls\ndo.  Only the boys are barefoot.\"\n\n\"You are excused,\" answered Laddie.  \"Three-fourths of the day is\nenough to begin on.  Miss Amelia says you may come with me.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\nLaddie was stripping off my stockings as he looked into my eyes, and\nsmiled a peculiar little smile.\n\n\"Oh Laddie!\" I cried.  \"Will you take me?  Honest!\"\n\nHe laughed again and then he rubbed my feet.\n\n\"Poor abused feet,\" he said.  \"Sometimes I wish shoes had never been\ninvented.\"\n\n\"They feel pretty good when there's ice.\"\n\n\"So they do!\" said Laddie.\n\nHe swung me to the ground, and we crossed the road, climbed the fence,\nand in a minute our redbird swamp shut the schoolhouse and cross old\nMiss Amelia from sight.  Then we turned and started straight toward our\nBig Woods.  I could scarcely keep on the ground.\n\n\"How are the others getting along?\" asked Laddie.\n\n\"She's cross as two sticks,\" I told him.  \"Johnny Hood hasn't shot one\npaper wad, and Leon hadn't done a thing until he laughed about the\nbirds, and I guess he did that to make her forget me.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried Laddie.  \"I didn't suppose the boy thought that far.\"\n\n\"Oh, you never can tell by looking at him, how far Leon is thinking,\" I\nsaid.\n\n\"That's so, too,\" said Laddie.  \"Are your feet comfortable now?\"\n\n\"Yes, but Laddie, isn't my face marked?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it is a little,\" said Laddie.  \"We'll bathe it again at the\ncreek.  We must get it fixed so mother won't notice.\"\n\n\"What will the Princess think?\"\n\n\"That you fell, perhaps,\" said Laddie.\n\n\"Do the tears show?\"\n\n\"Not at all.  We washed them all away.\"\n\n\"Did I do wrong, Laddie?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think you did.\"\n\n\"But it wasn't true, what she said.\"\n\n\"That's not the point.\"\n\nWe had reached the fence of the Big Woods.  He lifted me to the top\nrail and explained, while I combed his waving hair with my fingers.\n\n\"She didn't strike you because what you said was not so, for it was.\nShe knew instantly you were right, if she knows anything at all about\noutdoors.  This is what made her angry: it is her first day.  She\nwanted to make a good impression on her pupils, to arouse their\ninterest, and awaken their respect.  When you spoke, all of them knew\nyou were right, and she was wrong; that made her ridiculous.  Can't you\nsee how it made her look and feel?\"\n\n\"I didn't notice how she looked, but from the way she hit me, you could\ntell she felt bad enough.\"\n\n\"She surely did,\" said Laddie, kissing my cheek softly.  \"Poor little\nwoman!  What a world of things you have to learn!\"\n\n\"Shouldn't I have told her how mistaken she was?\"\n\n\"If you had gone to her alone, at recess or noon, or to-night, probably\nshe would have thanked you.  Then she could have corrected herself at\nsome convenient time and kept her dignity.\"\n\n\"Must I ask her pardon?\"\n\n\"What you should do, is to put yourself in Miss Amelia's place and try\nto understand how she felt.  Then if you think you wouldn't have liked\nany one to do to you what you did to her, you'll know.\"\n\nI hugged Laddie tight and thought fast--there was no need to think long\nto see how it was.\n\n\"I got to tell her I was wrong,\" I said.  \"Now let's go to the\nEnchanted Wood and see if we can find the Queen's daughter.\"\n\n\"All right!\" said Laddie.\n\nHe leaped the fence, swung me over, and started toward the pawpaw\nthicket.  He didn't do much going around.  He crashed through and over;\nand soon he began whistling the loveliest little dancy tune.  It made\nyour head whirl, and your toes tingle, and you knew it was singing that\nway in his heart, and he was just letting out the music.  That was why\nit made you want to dance and whirl; it was so alive.  But that wasn't\nthe way in an Enchanted Wood.  I pulled his hand.\n\n\"Laddie!\" I cautioned, \"keep in the path!  You'll step on the Fairies\nand crush a whole band with one foot.  No wonder the Queen makes her\ndaughter grow big when she sends her to you.  If you make so much\nnoise, some one will hear you, then this won't be a secret any more.\"\n\nLaddie laughed, but he stepped carefully in the path after that, and he\nsaid:  \"There are times, Little Sister, when I don't care whether this\nsecret is secret another minute or not.  Secrets don't agree with me.\nI'm too big, and broad, and too much of a man, to go creeping through\nthe woods with a secret.  I prefer to print it on a banner and ride up\nthe road waving it.\"\n\n\"Like,--'A youth who bore mid snow and ice, A banner with a strange\ndevice,'\" I said.\n\n\"That would be 'a banner with a strange device,'\" laughest Laddie.\n\"But, yes--something like!\"\n\n\"Have you told the Princess?\"\n\n\"I have!\" Laddie fairly shouted it.\n\n\"Docs SHE like secrets?\"\n\n\"No more than I do!\"\n\n\"Then why----?\"\n\n\"There you go!\" said Laddie.  \"Zeus, but the woman is beginning to\nmeasle out all over you!  You know as well as any one that there's\nsomething wrong at her house.  I don't know what it is; I can't even\nmake a sensible guess as yet, but it's worse than the neighbours think.\nIt's a thing that has driven a family from their home country, under a\nname that I have doubts about being theirs, and sent them across an\nocean, 'strangers in a strange land,' as it says in the Bible.  It's\nsomething that keeps a cultured gentleman and scholar raging up and\ndown the roads and over the country like a madman.  It shuts a\nwhite-faced, lovely, little woman from her neighbours, but I have\npassed her walking the road at night with both hands pressed against\nher heart.  Sometimes it tries the Princess past endurance and control;\nand it has her so worn and tired struggling with it that she is willing\nto carry another secret, rather than try to find strength to do\nanything that would make more trouble for her father and mother.\"\n\n\"Would it trouble them for her to know you, Laddie?\"\n\n\"So long as they don't and won't become acquainted with me, or any one,\nof course it would.\"\n\n\"Can't you force them to know you?\"\n\n\"That I can!\" said Laddie.  \"But you see, I only met the Princess a\nshort time ago, and there would be no use in raising trouble, unless\nshe will make me her Knight!\"\n\n\"But hasn't she, Laddie?\"\n\n\"Not in the very littlest least,\" said Laddie.  \"For all I know, she is\nmerely using me to help pass a lonely hour.  You see, people reared in\nEngland have ideas of class, that two or three generations spent here\nwash out.  The Princess and her family are of the unwashed British.\nFather's people have been here long enough to judge a man on his own\nmerits.\"\n\n\"You mean the Princess' family would think you're not good enough to be\nher Knight?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\"\n\n\"And we know that our family thinks they are infidels, and wicked\npeople; and that if she would have you, mother would be sick in bed\nover it.  Oh Laddie!\"\n\n\"Precisely!\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"That I must find out.\"\n\n\"When it will make so much trouble, why not forget her, and go on like\nyou did before she came?  Then, all of us were happy.  Now, it makes me\nshiver to think what will happen.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" said Laddie.  \"But look here, Little Sister, right in my\nface.  Will you ever forget the Princess?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"Then how can you ask me to?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean forget her, exactly.  I meant not come here and do\nthings that will make every one unhappy.\"\n\n\"One minute, Chick-a-Biddy,\" said Laddie.  Sometimes he called me that,\nwhen he loved me the very most of all.  I don't believe any one except\nme ever heard him do it.  \"Let me ask you this: does our father love\nour mother?\"\n\n\"Love her?\" I cried.  \"Why he just loves her to death!  He turns so\nwhite, and he suffers so, when her pain is the worst.  Love her?  And\nshe him?  Why, don't you remember the other day when he tipped her head\nagainst him and kissed her throat as he left the table; that he asked\nher if she 'loved him yet,' and she said right before all of us, 'Why\nPaul, I love you, until I scarcely can keep my fingers off you!'\nLaddie, is it like that with you and the Princess?\"\n\n\"It is with me,\" said Laddie.  \"Not with the Princess!  Now, can I\nforget her?  Can I keep away from even the chance to pass her on the\nroad?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said.  \"No, you can't, Laddie.  But can you ever make her love\nyou?\"\n\n\"It takes time to find that out,\" said Laddie.  \"I have got to try; so\nyou be a woman and keep my secret a little while longer, until I find a\nway out, but don't bother your head about it!\"\n\n\"I can't help bothering my head, Laddie.  Can't you make her understand\nthat God is not a myth?\"\n\n\"I'm none too sure what I believe myself,\" said Laddie.  \"Not that\nthere is no God--I don't mean that--but I surely don't believe all\nfather's teachings.\"\n\n\"If you believe God, do other little things matter, Laddie?\"\n\n\"I think not,\" said Laddie, \"else Heaven would be all Methodists.  As\nfor the Princess, all she has heard in her life has been against there\nbeing a God.  Now, she is learning something on the other side.  After\na while she can judge for herself.  It is for us, who profess to be a\nChristian family, to prove to her why we believe in God, and what He\ndoes for us.\"\n\n\"Well, she would think He could do a good deal, if she knew how mother\nhated asking her to come to our house; and yet she did it, beautifully\ntoo, just to give her a chance to see that very thing.  But I almost\nmade her do it.  I don't believe she ever would alone, Laddie, or at\nleast not for a long time yet.\"\n\n\"I saw that, and understood it perfectly,\" said Laddie.  \"Thank you,\nLittle Sister.\"  He picked me up and hugged me tight.  \"If I could only\nmake you see!\"\n\n\"But Laddie, I do!  I'm not a baby!  I know how people love and make\nhomes for themselves, like Sally and Peter are going to.  If it is with\nyou about the Princess as it is with father and mother, why I do know.\"\n\n\"All right!  Here we are!\" said Laddie.\n\nHe parted the willows and we stepped on the Magic Carpet, and that\nminute the Magic worked.  I forgot every awful, solemn, troublous thing\nwe had been talking about, and looked around while Laddie knelt and\nhunted for a letter, and there was none.  That meant the Princess was\ncoming, so we sat on the throne to wait.  We hadn't remembered to bathe\nmy cheek, we had been so busy when we passed the water, and I doubt if\nwe were thinking much then.  We just waited.  The willow walls waved\ngently, the moss carpet was spotted with little gold patches of\nsunlight, in the shade a few of the red flowers still bloomed, and big,\nlazy bumblebees hummed around them, or a hummingbird stood on air\nbefore them.  A sort of golden throbbing filled the woods, and my heart\nbegan to leap, why, I don't know; but I'm sure Laddie's did too, for I\nlooked at him and his eyes were shining as I never had seen them\nbefore, while his cheeks were a little red, and he was breathing like\nwhen you've been running; then suddenly his body grew tense against\nmine, and that meant she was coming.\n\nLike that first day, she came slowly through the woods, stopping here\nand there to touch the trunk of a tree, put back a branch, or bend over\na flower face.  Brown as the wood floor was her dress, and cardinal\nflowers blazed on her breast, and the same colour showed on her cheeks\nand lips.  Her eyes were like Laddie's for brightness, and she was\nbreathing the same way.  I thought sure there was going to be something\nto remember a lifetime--I was so excited I couldn't stand still.\nBefore it could happen Laddie went and said it was a \"beautiful day,\"\nand she said \"it didn't show in the woods, but the pastures needed\nrain.\"  Then she kissed me.  Well if I ever!  I sank on the throne and\nsat there.  They went on talking like that, until it was too dull to\nbear, so I slipped out and wandered away to see what I could find.\nWhen I grew tired and went back, Laddie was sitting on the Magic Carpet\nwith his back against the beech, and the Princess was on the throne\nreading from a little book, reading such interesting things that I\ndecided to listen.  After a while she came to this:\n\n  \"Thou are mated with a clown,\n  And the grossness of his nature, will have weight to bear thee\n      down.\"\n\nLaddie threw back his head, and how he laughed!  The Princess put down\nthe book and looked at him so surprised.\n\n\"Are you reading that to me because you think it appropriate?\" asked\nLaddie.\n\n\"I am reading it because it is conceded to be one of the most beautiful\npoems ever written,\" said the Princess.\n\n\"You knew when you began that you would come to those lines.\"\n\n\"I never even thought of such a thing.\"\n\n\"But you knew that is how your father would regard any relationship,\nfriendly or deeper, with me!\"\n\n\"I cannot possibly be held responsible for what my father thinks.\"\n\n\"It is natural that you should think alike.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily!  You told me recently that you didn't agree with your\nfather on many subjects.\"\n\n\"Kindly answer me this,\" said Laddie:  \"Do you feel that I'm a 'clown'\nbecause I'm not schooled to the point on all questions of good manners?\nDo you find me gross because I plow and sow?\"\n\n\"You surprise me,\" said the Princess.  \"My consenting to know and to\nspend a friendly hour with you here is sufficient answer.  I have not\nfound the slightest fault with your manners.  I have seen no suspicion\nof 'grossness' about you.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me, frankly, exactly what you do think of me?\"\n\n\"Surely!  I think you are a clean, decent man, who occasionally kindly\nconsents to put a touch of human interest into an hour, for a very\nlonely girl.  What has happened, Laddie?  This is not like you.\"\n\nLaddie sat straight and studied the beech branches.  Father said beech\ntrees didn't amount to much; but I first learned all about them from\nthat one, and what it taught me made me almost worship them always.\nThere were the big trunk with great rough spreading roots, the bark in\nlittle ridges in places, smooth purple gray between, big lichens for\nornament, the low flat branches, the waxy, wavy-edged leaves, with\nclear veins, and the delicious nuts in their little brown burrs.  The\nPrincess and I both stared at the branches and waited while a little\nbreath of air stirred the leaves, the sunshine flickered, and a cricket\nsang a sort of lonesome song.  Laddie leaned against the tree again,\nand he was thinking so hard, to look at him made me begin to repeat to\nmyself the beech part of that beautiful churchyard poem our big folks\nrecite:\n\n  \"There, at the foot of yonder nodding beech,\n   That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,\n   His listless length at noontide he would stretch,\n   And pore upon the brook that babbles by.\"\n\n\nOnly he was studying so deeply you could almost feel what was in his\nmind, and it was not about the brook at all, even if one ran close.\nSoon he began talking.\n\n\"Not so bad!\" he said.  \"You might think worse.  I admit the\ncleanliness, I strive for decency, I delight in being humanely\ninteresting, even for an hour; you might think worse, much worse!  You\nmight consider me a 'clown.'  'A country clod.'  Rather a lowdown,\ncommon thing, a 'clod,' don't you think?  And a 'clown'!  And 'gross'\non top of that!\"\n\n\"What can you mean?\" asked the Princess.\n\n\"Since you don't seem to share the estimate of me, I believe I'll tell\nyou,\" said Laddie.  \"The other day I was driving from the gravel pit\nwith a very heavy load.  The road was wide and level on either side.  A\nman came toward me on horseback.  Now the law of the road is to give\nhalf to a vehicle similar to the one you are driving, but to keep all\nof it when you are heavily loaded, if you are passing people afoot or\nhorseback.  The man took half the road, and kept it until the nose of\nhis horse touched one of the team I was driving.  I stopped and said:\n'Good morning, sir!  Do you wish to speak with me?'  He called angrily:\n'Get out of my way, you clod!'  'Sorry sir, but I can't,' I said.  'The\nlaw gives me this road when I am heavily loaded, and you are on foot or\nhorseback.'\"\n\n\"What did he do?\" asked the Princess.\n\nAnd from the way she looked I just knew she guessed the man was the\nsame one I thought of.\n\n\"He raised his whip to strike my horse,\" said Laddie.\n\n\"Ah, surely!\" said the Princess.  \"Always an arm raised to strike.  And\nyou, Man?  What did you do?\" she cried eagerly.\n\n\"I stood on my load, suddenly,\" said Laddie, \"and I called: 'Hold one\nminute!'\"\n\n\"And he?\" breathed the Princess.\n\n\"Something made him pause with his arm still raised.  I said to him:\n'You must not strike my horse.  It never has been struck, and it can't\ndefend itself.  If you want to come a few steps farther and tackle me,\ncome ahead!  I can take it or return it, as I choose.'\"\n\n\"Go on!\" said the Princess.\n\n\"That's all,\" said Laddie, \"or at least almost all.\"\n\n\"Did he strike?\"\n\n\"He did not.  He stared at me a second, and then he rode around me; but\nhe was making forceful remarks as he passed about 'country clods,' and\nthere was an interesting one about a 'gross clown.'  What you read made\nme think of it, that is all.\"\n\nThe Princess stared into the beech branches for a time and then she\nsaid:  \"I will ask your pardon for him.  He always had a domineering\ntemper, and trouble he had lately has almost driven him mad; he is\nscarcely responsible at times.  I hesitate about making him angry.\"\n\n\"I think perhaps,\" said Laddie, \"I would have done myself credit if I\nhad recognized that, and given him the road, when he made a point of\nclaiming it.\"\n\n\"Indeed no!\" cried the Princess.  \"To be beaten at the game he started\nwas exactly what he needed.  If you had turned from his way, he would\nhave considered you a clod all his life.  Since you made him go around,\nit may possibly dawn on him that you are a man.  You did the very best\nthing.\"\n\nThen she began to laugh, and how she did laugh.\n\n\"I would give my allowance for a quarter to have seen it,\" she cried.\n\"I must hurry home and tell mother.\"\n\n\"Does your mother know about me?\" he demanded.  \"Does she know that you\ncome here?\"\n\nThe Princess arose and stood very tall and straight.\n\n\"You may beg my pardon or cease to know me,\" she said.  \"Whatever led\nyou to suppose that I would know or meet you without my mother's\nknowledge?\"\n\nThen she started toward the entrance.\n\n\"One minute!\" cried Laddie.\n\nA leap carried him to her side.  He caught her hands and held them\ntight, and looked straight into her eyes.  Then he kissed her hands\nover and over.  I thought from the look on her face he might have\nkissed her cheek if he had dared risk it; but he didn't seem to notice.\nThen she stooped and kissed me, and turned toward home, while Laddie\nand I crossed the woods to the west road, and went back past the\nschoolhouse.  I was so tired Laddie tied the strings together and hung\nmy shoes across his shoulders and took me by the arm the last mile.\n\nAll of them were at home when we got there, and Miss Amelia came to the\ngate to meet us.  She was mealy-mouthed and good as pie, not at all as\nI had supposed she would be.  I wonder what Laddie said to her.  But\nthen he always could manage things for every one.  That set me to\nwondering if by any possible means he could fix them for himself.  I\nclimbed to the catalpa to think, and the more I thought, the more I\nfeared he couldn't; but still mother always says one never can tell\nuntil they try, and I knew he would try with every ounce of brain and\nmuscle in him.  I sat there until the supper bell rang, and then I\nwashed and reached the table last.  The very first thing, mother asked\nhow I bruised my face, and before I could think what to tell her, Leon\nsaid just as careless like:  \"Oh she must have run against something\nhard, playing tag at recess.\"  Laddie began talking about Peter coming\nthat night, and every one forgot me, but pretty soon I slipped a glance\nat Miss Amelia, and saw that her face was redder than mine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe Wedding Gown\n\n  \"The gay belles of fashion may boast of excelling\n    In waltz or cotillon, at whist or quadrille;\n  And seek admiration by vauntingly telling\n    Of drawing and painting, and musical skill;\n  But give me the fair one, in country or city,\n    Whose home and its duties are dear to her heart,\n  Who cheerfully warbles some rustical ditty,\n    While plying the needle with exquisite art:\n  The bright little needle, the swift-flying needle,\n    The needle directed by beauty and art.\"\n\n\nThe next morning Miss Amelia finished the chapter--that made two for\nour family.  Father always read one before breakfast--no wonder I knew\nthe Bible quite well--then we sang a song, and she made a stiff, little\nprayer.  I had my doubts about her prayers; she was on no such terms\nwith the Lord as my father.  He got right at Him and talked like a\ndoctor, and you felt he had some influence, and there was at least a\npossibility that he might get what he asked for; but Miss Amelia prayed\nas if the Lord were ten million miles away, and she would be surprised\nto pieces if she got anything she wanted.  When she asked the Almighty\nto make us good, obedient children, there was not a word she said that\nshowed she trusted either the Lord or us, or thought there was anything\nbetween us and heaven that might make us good because we wanted to be.\nYou couldn't keep your eyes from the big gad and ruler on her desk; she\noften fingered them as she prayed, and you knew from her stiff, little,\nsawed-out petition that her faith was in implements, and she'd hit you\na crack the minute she was the least angry, same as she had me the day\nbefore.  I didn't feel any too good toward her, but when the blood of\nthe Crusaders was in the veins, right must be done even if it took a\nstruggle.  I had to live up to those little gold shells on the trinket.\nFather said they knew I was coming down the line, so they put on a bird\nfor me; but I told him I would be worthy of the shells too.  This took\nabout as hard a fight for me as any Crusade would for a big, trained\nsoldier.  I had been wrong, Laddie had made me see that.  So I held up\nmy hand, and Miss Amelia saw me as she picked up Ray's arithmetic.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nI held to the desk to brace myself, and tried twice before I could\nraise my voice so that she heard.\n\n\"Please, Miss Amelia,\" I said, \"I was wrong about the birds yesterday.\nNot that they don't fight--they do!  But I was wrong to contradict you\nbefore every one, and on your first day, and if you'll only excuse me,\nthe next time you make a mistake, I'll tell you after school or at\nrecess.\"\n\nThe room was so still you could hear the others breathing.  Miss Amelia\npicked up the ruler and started toward me.  Possibly I raised my hands.\nThat would be no Crusader way, but you might do it before you had time\nto think, when the ruler was big and your head was the only place that\nwould be hit.  The last glimpse I had of her in the midst of all my\ntrouble made me think of Sabethany Perkins.\n\nSabethany died, and they buried her at the foot of the hill in our\ngraveyard before I could remember.  But her people thought heaps of\nher, and spent much money on the biggest tombstone in the cemetery, and\nplanted pinies and purple phlox on her, and went every Sunday to visit\nher.  When they moved away, they missed her so, they decided to come\nback and take her along.  The men were at work, and Leon and I went to\nsee what was going on.  They told us, and said we had better go away,\nbecause possibly things might happen that children would sleep better\nnot to see.  Strange how a thing like that makes you bound you will\nsee.  We went and sat on the fence and waited.  Soon they reached\nSabethany, but they could not seem to get her out.  They tried, and\ntried, and at last they sent for more men.  It took nine of them to\nbring her to the surface.  What little wood was left, they laid back to\nsee what made her so fearfully heavy, and there she was turned to solid\nstone.  They couldn't chip a piece off her with the shovel.  Mother\nalways said, \"For goodness sake, don't let your mouth hang open,\" and\nas a rule we kept ours shut; but you should have seen Leon's when he\nsaw Sabethany wouldn't chip off, and no doubt mine was as bad.\n\n\"When Gabriel blows his trumpet, and the dead arise and come forth,\nwhat on earth will they do with Sabethany?\" I gasped.  \"Why, she\ncouldn't fly to Heaven with wings a mile wide, and what use could they\nmake of her if she got there?\"\n\n\"I can't see a thing she'd be good for except a hitching post,\" said\nLeon, \"and I guess they don't let horses in.  Let's go home.\"\n\nHe acted sick and I felt that way; so we went, but the last glimpse of\nSabethany remained with me.\n\nAs my head went down that day, I saw that Miss Amelia looked exactly\nlike her.  You would have needed a pick-ax or a crowbar to flake off\neven a tiny speck of her.  When I had waited for my head to be cracked,\nuntil I had time to remember that a Crusader didn't dodge and hide, I\nlooked up, and there she stood with the ruler lifted; but now she had\nturned just the shade of the wattles on our fightingest turkey gobbler.\n\n\"Won't you please forgive me?\"\n\nI never knew I had said it until I heard it, and then the only way to\nbe sure was because no one else would have been likely to speak at that\ntime.\n\nMiss Amelia's arm dropped and she glared at me.  I wondered whether I\never would understand grown people; I doubted if they understood\nthemselves, for after turning to stone in a second--father said it had\ntaken Sabethany seven years--and changing to gobbler red, Miss Amelia\nsuddenly began to laugh.  To laugh, of all things!  And then, of\ncourse, every one else just yelled.  I was so mortified I dropped my\nhead again and began to cry as I never would if she'd hit me.\n\n\"Don't feel badly!\" said Miss Amelia.  \"Certainly, I'll forgive you.  I\nsee you had no intention of giving offense, so none is taken.  Get out\nyour book and study hard on another lesson.\"\n\nThat was surprising.  I supposed I'd have to do the same one over, but\nI might take a new one.  I was either getting along fast, or Miss\nAmelia had her fill of birds.  I wiped my eyes as straight in front of\nme as I could slip up my handkerchief, and began studying the first\nlesson in my reader:  \"Pretty bee, pray tell me why, thus from flower\nto flower you fly, culling sweets the livelong day, never leaving off\nto play?\"  That was a poetry piece, and it was quite cheery, although\nit was all strung together like prose, but you couldn't fool me on\npoetry; I knew it every time.  As I studied I felt better, and when\nMiss Amelia came to hear me she was good as gold.  She asked if I liked\nhoney, and I started to tell her about the queen bee, but she had no\ntime to listen, so she said I should wait until after school.  Then we\nboth forgot it, for when we reached home, the Princess' horse was\nhitched to our rack, and I fairly ran in, I was so anxious to know what\nwas happening.\n\nI was just perfectly amazed at grown people!  After all the things our\nfolks had said!  You'd have supposed that Laddie would have been locked\nin the barn; father reading the thirty second Psalm to the Princess,\nand mother on her knees asking God to open her eyes like Saul's when he\ntried to kick against the pricks, and make her to see, as he did, that\nGod was not a myth, Well, there was no one in the sitting-room or the\nparlour, but there were voices farther on; so I slipped in.  I really\nhad to slip, for there was no other place they could be except the\nparlour bedroom, and Sally's wedding things were locked up there, and\nwe were not to see until everything was finished, like I told you.\n\nWell, this was what I saw: our bedroom had been a porch once, and when\nwe had been crowded on account of all of us coming, father enclosed it\nand made a room.  But he never had taken out the window in the wall.\nSo all I had to do when I wanted to know how fast the dresses were\nbeing made, was to shove up the window above my bed, push back the\nblind, and look in.  I didn't care what she had.  I just wanted to get\nahead of her and see before she was ready, to pay her for beating me.\nI knew what she had, and I meant to tell her, and walk away with my\nnose in the air when she offered to show me; but this was different.  I\nwas wild to see what was going on because the Princess was there.  The\nroom was small, and the big cherry four-poster was very large, and all\nof them were talking, so no one paid the slightest attention to me.\n\nMother sat in the big rocking chair, with Sally on one of its arms,\nleaning against her shoulder.  Shelley and May and the sewing woman\nwere crowded between the wall and the footboard, and the others lined\nagainst the wall.  The bed was heaped in a tumble of everything a woman\never wore.  Seemed to me there was more stuff there than all the rest\nof us had, put together.  The working dresses and aprons had been made\non the machine, but there were heaps and stacks of hand-made\nunderclothes.  I could see the lovely chemise mother embroidered lying\non top of a pile of bedding, and over and over Sally had said that\nevery stitch in the wedding gown must be taken by hand.  The Princess\nstood beside the bed.  A funny little tight hat like a man's and a\nriding whip lay on a chair close by.  I couldn't see what she wore--her\nusual riding clothes probably--for she had a nip in each shoulder of a\ndress she was holding to her chin and looking down at.  After all, I\nhadn't seen everything!  Never before or since have I seen a lovelier\ndress than that.  It was what always had been wrapped in the sheet on\nthe foot of the bed and I hadn't got a peep at it.  The pale green silk\nwith tiny pink moss roses in it, that I had been thinking was the\nwedding dress, looked about right to wash the dishes in, compared with\nthis.\n\nThis was a wedding dress.  You didn't need any one to tell you.  The\nPrincess had as much red as I ever had seen in her cheeks, her eyes\nwere bright, and she was half-laughing and half-crying.\n\n\"Oh you lucky, lucky girl!\" she was saying.  \"What a perfectly\nbeautiful bride you will be!  Never have I seen a more wonderful dress!\nWhere did you get the material?\"\n\nNow we had been trained always to wait for mother to answer a visitor\nas she thought suitable, or at least to speak one at a time and not\ninterrupt; but about six of those grown people told the Princess all at\nthe same time how our oldest sister Elizabeth was married to a merchant\nwho had a store at Westchester and how he got the dress in New York,\nand gave it to Sally for her wedding present, or she never could have\nhad it.\n\nThe Princess lifted it and set it down softly.  \"Oh look!\" she cried.\n\"Look!  It will stand alone!\"\n\nThere it stood!  Silk stiff enough to stand by itself, made into a\nlittle round waist, cut with a round neck and sleeves elbow length and\nflowing almost to where Sally's knees would come.  It was a pale\npearl-gray silk crossed in bars four inches square, made up of a dim\nyellow line almost as wide as a wheat straw, with a thread of black on\neach side of it, and all over, very wide apart, were little faint\nsplashes of black as if they had been lightly painted on.  The skirt\nwas so wide it almost filled the room.  Every inch of that dress was\nlined with soft, white silk.  There was exquisite lace made into a flat\ncollar around the neck, and ruffled from sight up the inside of the\nwide sleeves.  That was the beginning.  The finish was something you\nnever saw anything like before.  It was a trimming made of white and\nyellow beads.  There was a little heading of white beads sewed into a\npattern, then a lacy fringe that was pale yellow beads, white inside,\neach an inch long, that dangled, and every bead ended with three tiny\nwhite ones.  That went around the neck, the outside of the sleeves, and\nin a pattern like a big letter V all the way around the skirt.  And\nthere it stood--alone!\n\nThe Princess, graceful as a bird and glowing like fire, danced around\nit, and touched it, and lifted the sleeves, and made the bead fringe\nswing, and laughed, and talked every second.  Sally, and mother, and\nall of them had smiled such wide smiles for so long, their faces looked\nalmost as set as Sabethany's, but of course far different.  Being dead\nwas one thing, getting ready for a wedding another.\n\nAnd it looked too as if God might be a myth, for all they cared, so\nlong as the Princess could make the wedding dress stand alone, and talk\na blue streak of things that pleased them.  It was not put on either,\nfor there stood the dress, shimmering like the inside of a pearl-lined\nshell, white as a lily, and the tinkly gold fringe.  No one COULD have\nsaid enough about it, so no matter what the Princess said, it had to be\nall right.  She kept straight on showing all of them how lovely it was,\nexactly as if they hadn't seen it before, and she had to make them\nunderstand about it, as if she felt afraid they might have missed some\nelegant touch she had seen.\n\n\"Do look how the lace falls when I raise this sleeve!  Oh how will you\nwear this and think of a man enough to say the right words in the right\nplace?\"\n\nMother laughed, and so did all of them.\n\n\"Do please show me the rest,\" begged the Princess.  \"I know there are\nslippers and a bonnet!\"\n\nSally just oozed pride.  She untied the strings and pushed the\nprettiest striped bag from a lovely pink bandbox and took out a dear\nlittle gray bonnet with white ribbons, and the yellow bead fringe, and\na bunch of white roses with a few green leaves.  These she touched\nsoftly, \"I'm not quite sure about the leaves,\" she said.\n\nThe Princess had the bonnet, turning and tilting it.\n\n\"Perfect!\" she cried.  \"Quite perfect!  You need that touch of colour,\nand it blends with everything.  How I envy you!  Oh why doesn't some\none ask me, so I can have things like these?  I think your brother is a\ngenius.  I'm going to ride to Westchester tomorrow and give him an\norder to fill for me the next time he goes to the city.  No one shows\nme such fabrics when I go, and Aunt Beatrice sends nothing from London\nI like nearly so well.  Oh!  Oh!\"\n\nShe was on her knees now, lifting the skirt to set under little white\nsatin slippers with gold buckles, and white bead buttons.  When she had\nthem arranged to suit her, she sat on the floor and kept straight on\nsaying the things my mother and sisters seemed crazy to hear.  When\nSally showed her the long white silk mitts that went with the bonnet,\nthe Princess cried:  \"Oh do ride home with me and let me give you a\nhandkerchief Aunt Beatrice sent me, to carry in your hand!\"\n\nThen her face flushed and she added without giving Sally time to say\nwhat she would do:  \"Or I can bring it the next time I come past.  It\nbelongs with these things and I have no use for it.  May I?\"\n\n\"Please do!  I'll use it for the thing I borrow.\"\n\n\"But I mean it to be a gift,\" said the Princess.  \"It was made to go\nwith these lace mitts and satin slippers.  You must take it!\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Sally.  \"If you really want me to have it,\nof course I'd love to.\"\n\n\"I'll bring it to-morrow,\" promised the Princess.  \"And I wish you'd\nlet me try a way I know to dress hair for a wedding.  Yours is so\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"You're kind, I'm sure,\" said Sally.  \"I had intended to wear it as I\nalways do, so I would appear perfectly natural to the folks; but if you\nknow a more becoming way, I could begin it now, and they would be\nfamiliar with it by that time.\"\n\n\"I shan't touch it,\" said the Princess, studying Sally's face.  \"Your\nidea is right.  You don't want to commence any new, unfamiliar style\nthat would make you seem different, just at a time when every one\nshould see how lovely you are, as you always have been.  But don't\nforget to wear something blue, and something borrowed for luck, and oh\ndo please put on one of my garters!\"\n\n\"Well for mercy sake!\" cried my mother.  \"Why?\"\n\n\"So some one will propose to me before the year is out,\" laughed the\nPrincess.  \"I think it must be the most fun of all, to make beautiful\nthings for your very own home, and lovely dresses, and be surrounded by\nfriends all eager to help you, and to arrange a house and live with a\nman you love well enough to marry, and fix for little people who might\ncome----\"\n\n\"You know perfectly there isn't a single man in the county who wouldn't\npropose to you, if you'd let him come within a mile of you,\" said\nShelley.\n\n\"When the right man comes I'll go half the mile to meet him? you may be\nsure of that; won't I, Mrs. Stanton?\" the Princess turned to mother.\n\n\"I have known girls who went even farther,\" said my mother rather dryly.\n\n\"I draw the line at half,\" laughed the Princess.  \"Now I must go; I\nhave been so long my people will be wondering what I'm doing.\"\n\nStanding in the middle of the room she put on her hat, picked up her\nwhip and gloves, and led the way to the hitching rack, while all of us\nfollowed.  At the gate stood Laddie as he had come from the field.  His\nold hat was on the back of his head, his face flushed, his collar\nloosened so that his strong white neck showed, and his sleeves were\nrolled to the elbow, as they had been all summer, and his arms were\nburned almost to blisters.  When he heard us coming he opened the gate,\nwent to the rack, untied the Princess' horse and led it beside the\nmounting block.  As she came toward him, he took off his hat and\npitched it over the fence on the grass.\n\n\"Miss Pryor, allow me to make you acquainted with my son,\" said mother.\n\nI felt as if I would blow up.  I couldn't keep my eyes from turning\ntoward the Princess.  Gee!  I could have saved my feelings.  She made\nmother the prettiest little courtsey I ever set eyes on, and then\nturned and made a deeper one to Laddie.\n\n\"I met your son in one of the village stores some time ago,\" she said.\n\"Back her one step farther, please!\"\n\nLaddie backed the horse, and quicker than you could see how it was\ndone, she flashed up the steps and sat the saddle; but as she leaned\nover the horse's neck to take the rein from Laddie, he got one level\nlook straight in the eyes that I was sure none of the others saw,\nbecause they were not watching for it, and I was.  Laddie bowed from\nthe waist, and put the reins in her fingers all in one movement.  He\ncaught the glance she gave him too; I could almost feel it like a band\npassing between them.  Then she called a laughing good-bye to all of us\nat once, and showed us how to ride right, as she flashed toward the\nLittle Hill.  That was riding, you may believe, and mother sighed as\nshe watched her.\n\n\"If I were a girl again,\" she said, \"I would ride as well as that, or\nI'd never mount a horse.\"\n\n\"She's been trained from her cradle, and her father deals in horses.\nHalf the battle in riding is a thoroughbred,\" said Laddie.  \"No such\nhorse as that ever stepped these roads before.\"\n\n\"And no such girl ever travelled them,\" said my mother, folding her\nhands one over the other on top of a post of the hitching rack.  \"I\nmust say I don't know how this is coming out, and it troubles me.\"\n\n\"Why, what's up?\" asked Laddie, covering her hands with his and looking\nher in the eyes.\n\n\"Just this,\" said my mother.  \"She's more beautiful of face and form\nthan God ought to allow any woman to be, in mercy to the men who will\nbe forced to meet her.  Her speech is highly cultured.  Her manners are\nperfect, and that is a big and unusual thing in a girl of her age.\nEvery word she said, every move she made to-day, was exactly as I would\nhave been proud to hear, and to see a daughter of mine speak and move.\nIf I had only myself to consider, I would make her my friend, because\nI'm seasoned in the ways of the world, and she could influence me only\nas I chose to allow her.  With you youngsters it is different.  You'll\nfind her captivating, and you may let her ways sway you without even\nknowing it.  All these outward things are not essential; they are\npleasing, I grant, but they have nothing to do with the one big,\nelemental fact that a Godless life is not even half a life.  I never\nyet have known any man or woman who attempted it who did not waste\nlife's grandest opportunities, and then come crawling and defeated to\nthe foot of the cross in the end, asking God's mercy where none was\ndeserved or earned.  It seems to me a craven way.  I know all about the\nforgiveness on the cross!  I know God is big enough and merciful enough\nto accept even death-bed repentance, but what is that to compare with\nlaying out your course and running it a lifetime without swerving?  I\ndetest and distrust this infidel business.  I want no child of mine\nunder its influence, or in contact with it.\"\n\n\"But when your time comes, if you said just those things to hers and\nwon her, what a triumph, little mother!\"\n\n\"'If!'\" answered mother.  \"That's always the trouble!  One can't be\nsure!  'If' I knew I could accomplish that, I would get on my knees and\nwrestle with the Lord for the salvation of the soul of a girl like\nthat, not to mention her poor, housebound mother, and that man with the\nunhappiest face I ever have seen, her father.  It's worth trying, but\nsuppose I try and fail, and at the same time find that in bringing her\namong us she has influenced some of mine to the loss of their immortal\nsouls then, what will I have done?\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said Laddie; \"mother, have you such a poor opinion of the\nthings you and father have taught us, and the lives you've lived before\nus, that you're really afraid of a slip of a girl, almost a stranger?\"\n\n\"The most attractive girl I ever have seen, and mighty willing to be no\nlonger a stranger, Lad.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't promise for the others,\" said Laddie, \"but for myself I\nwill give you my word of honour that I won't be influenced the breadth\nof one hair by her, in a doctrinal way.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said my mother.  \"And it is for you I fear.  If a young man is\ngiven the slightest encouragement by a girl like that, even his God\ncan't always hold him; and you never have made a confession of faith,\nLaddie.  It is you she will be most likely to captivate.\"\n\n\"If you think I have any chance, I'll go straight over and ask her\nfather for her this very evening,\" said Laddie, and even mother\nlaughed; then all of us started to the house, for it was almost supper\ntime.  I got ready and thought I'd take one more peep at the dress\nbefore Sally pinned it in the sheet again, and when I went back, there\nall huddled in a bunch before it stood Miss Amelia, the tears running\ndown her cheeks.\n\n\"Did Sally say you might come here?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" said Miss Amelia, \"but I've been so crazy to see I just slipped\nin to take a peep when I noticed the open door.  I'll go this minute.\nPlease don't tell her.\"\n\nI didn't say what I would do, but I didn't intend to.\n\n\"What are you crying about?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Ah, I too have known love,\" sobbed Miss Amelia.  \"Once I made a\nwedding dress, and expected to be a happy bride.\"\n\n\"Well, wasn't you?\" I asked, and knew at once it was a silly question,\nfor of course she would not be a miss, if she had not missed marrying.\n\n\"He died!\" sobbed Miss Amelia.\n\nIf he could have seen her then, I believe he'd have been glad of it;\nbut maybe he looked as bony and dejected as she did before he went; and\nhe may have turned to stone afterward, as sometimes happens.  Right\nthen I heard Sally coming, so I grabbed Miss Amelia and dragged her\nunder the fourposter, where I always hid when caught doing something I\nshouldn't.  But Sally had so much stuff she couldn't keep all of it on\nthe bed, and when she stooped and lifted the ruffle to shove a box\nunder, she pushed it right against us, and knelt to look, and there we\nwere.\n\n\"Well upon my soul!\" she cried, and sat flat on the floor, holding the\nruffle, peering in.  \"Miss Amelia!  And in tears!  Whatever is the\ntrouble?\"\n\nMiss Amelia's face was redder than any crying ever made it, and I saw\nshe wanted to kill me for getting her into such a fix, and if she\nbecame too angry probably she'd take it out on me in school the next\nday, so I thought I'd better keep her at work shedding tears.\n\n\"'HE DIED!'\"  I told Sally as pathetically as ever I could.\n\nSally dropped the ruffle instantly, but I saw her knees shake against\nthe floor.  After a while she lifted the curtain and offered Miss\nAmelia her hand.\n\n\"I was leaving my dress to show you before putting it away,\" she said.\n\nI didn't believe it; but that was what she said.  Maybe it was an\nimpulse.  Mother always said Sally was a creature of impulse.  When she\ntook off her flannel petticoat and gave it to poor little half-frozen\nAnnie Hasty, that was a good impulse, but it sent Sally to bed for a\nweek.  And when she threw a shovel of coals on Bill Ramsdell's dog,\nbecause Bill was a shiftless lout, and the dog was so starved it all\nthe time came over and sucked our eggs, that was a bad impulse, because\nit didn't do Bill a particle of good, and it hurt the dog, which would\nhave been glad to suck eggs at home, no doubt, if Bill hadn't been too\nworthless to keep hens.\n\nThat was a good impulse she had then, for she asked Miss Amelia to help\nher straighten the room, and of course that meant to fold and put away\nwedding things.  Any woman would have been wild to do that.  Then she\ntold Miss Amelia that she was going to ask father to dismiss school for\nhalf a day, and allow her to see the wedding, and she asked her if she\nwould help serve the breakfast.\n\nMiss Amelia wiped her eyes, and soon laughed and was just beaming.  I\nwould have been willing to bet my three cents for lead pencils the next\ntime the huckster came, that Sally never thought of wanting her until\nthat minute; and then she arranged for her to wait on table to keep her\nfrom trying to eat with the wedding party, because Miss Amelia had no\npretty clothes for one thing, and for another, you shouldn't act as if\nyou were hungry out in company, and she ate every meal as if she were\nbreaking a forty days' fast.  I wondered what her folks cooked at home.\n\nAfter supper Peter came, and the instant I saw him I thought of\nsomething, and it was such a teasing thought I followed around and\nwatched him harder every minute.  At last he noticed me, and put his\narms around me.\n\n\"Well, what is it, Little Sister?\" he asked.\n\nI did wish he would quit that.  No one really had a right to call me\nthat, except Laddie.  Maybe I had to put up with Peter doing it when I\nwas his sister by law, but before, the old name the preacher baptized\non me was good enough for Peter.  I was thinking about that so hard, I\ndidn't answer, and he asked again.\n\n\"I have seen Sally's wedding dress,\" I told him.\n\n\"But that's no reason why you should stare at me.\"\n\n\"That's just exactly the reason,\" I answered.  \"I was trying to see\nwhat in the world there is about you to be worth a dress like that.\"\n\nPeter laughed and laughed.  At last he said that he was not really\nworth even a calico dress; and he was so little worthy of Sally that he\nwould button her shoes, if she would let him.  He got that mixed.  The\nbuttons were on her slippers: her shoes laced.  But it showed a humble\nspirit in Peter.  Not that I care for humble spirits.  I am sure the\nCrusaders didn't have them.  I don't believe Laddie would lace even the\nPrincess' shoes, at least not to make a steady business of it.  But\nmaybe Peter and Sally had an agreement to help each other.  She was\nalways fixing his tie, and straightening his hair.  Maybe that was an\nimpulse, though, and mother said Sally would get over being so\nimpulsive when she cut her eye teeth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nWhen Sally Married Peter\n\n  \"Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,\n  Be it ever so humble there's no place like home!\n  A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,\n  Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.\"\n\n\nWhen they began arranging the house for the wedding, it could be seen\nthat they had been expecting it, and getting ready for a long time.\nFrom all the closets, shelves and chests poured heaps of new things.\nFirst, the walls were cleaned and some of them freshly papered, then\nthe windows were all washed long before regular housecleaning time, the\nfloors were scrubbed and new carpet put down.  Mother had some window\nblinds that Winfield had brought her from New York in the spring, and\nshe had laid them away; no one knew why, then.  We all knew now.  When\nmother was ready to put them up, father had a busy day and couldn't\nhelp her, and she was really provoked.  She almost cried about it, when\nLeon rode in bringing the mail, and said Hannah Dover had some exactly\nlike ours at her windows, that her son had sent from Illinois.  Father\nfelt badly enough then, for he always did everything he could to help\nmother to be first with everything; but so she wouldn't blame him, he\nsaid crosslike that if she had let him put them up when they came, as\nhe wanted to, she'd have been six months ahead.\n\nWhen they finally got ready to hang the blinds no one knew how they\nwent.  They were a beautiful shiny green, plain on one side, and on the\nother there was a silver border across the bottom and one pink rose as\nbig as a pie plate.  Mother had neglected to ask Winfield on which side\nthe rose belonged.  Father said from the way the roll ran, it went\ninside.  Mother said they were rolled that way to protect the roses,\nand that didn't prove anything.  Laddie said he would jump on a horse\nand ride round the section, and see how Hannah Dover had hers, and\nexactly opposite would be right.  Everyone laughed, but no one thought\nhe meant it.  Mother had father hold one against the window, and she\nstepped outside to see if she could tell from there.  When she came in\nshe said the flower looked mighty pretty, and she guessed that was the\nway, so father started hanging them.  He had only two up when Laddie\ncame racing down the Big Hill bareback, calling for him to stop.\n\n\"I tell you that's not right, mother!\" he said as he hurried in.\n\n\"But I went outside and father held one, and it looked real pretty,\"\nsaid mother.\n\n\"One!  Yes!\" said Laddie.  \"But have you stopped to consider how two\nrows across the house are going to look?  Nine big pink roses, with the\nsun shining on them!  Anything funnier than Dovers' front I never saw.\nAnd look here!\"\n\nLaddie picked up a blind.  \"See this plain back?  It's double coated\nlike a glaze.  That is so the sun shining through glass won't fade it.\nThe flowers would be gone in a week.  They belong inside, mother, sure\nas you live.\"\n\n\"Then when the blinds are rolled to the middle sash in the daytime no\none can see them,\" wailed mother, who was wild about pink roses.\n\n\"But at night, when they are down, you can put the curtains back enough\nto let the roses show, and think how pretty they will look then.\"\n\n\"Laddie is right!\" said father, climbing on the barrel to take down the\nones he had fixed.\n\n\"What do you think, girls?\" asked mother.\n\n\"I think the Princess is coming down the Little Hill,\" said Shelley.\n\"Hurry, father!  Take them down before she sees!  I'm sure they're\nwrong.\"\n\nFather got one all right, but tore the corner of the other.  Mother\nscolded him dreadfully cross, and he was so flustered he forgot about\nbeing on the barrel, so he stepped back the same as on the floor, and\nfell crashing.  He might have broken some of his bones, if Laddie\nhadn't seen and caught him.\n\n\"If you are SURE the flowers go inside, fix one before she comes!\"\ncried mother.\n\nFather stepped too close the edge of the chair, and by that time he\ndidn't know how to hang anything, so Laddie climbed up and had one\nnailed before the Princess stopped.  She came to bring Sally the\nhandkerchief, and it was the loveliest one any of us ever had seen.\nThere was a little patch in the middle about four inches square, and\naround it a wide ruffle of dainty lace.  It was made to carry in a hand\ncovered with white lace mitts, when you were wearing a wedding gown of\nsilver silk, lined with white.  Of course it wouldn't have been the\nslightest use for a funeral or with a cold in your head.  And it had\ncome from across the sea!  From the minute she took it by a pinch in\nthe middle, Sally carried her head so much higher than she ever had\nbefore, that you could notice the difference.\n\nLaddie went straight on nailing up the blinds, and every one he fixed\nhe let down full length so the Princess could see the roses were\ninside; he was so sure he was right.  After she had talked a few\nminutes she noticed the blinds going up.  Laddie, in a front window,\nwaved to her from the barrel.  She laughed and answered with her whip,\nand then she laughed again.\n\n\"Do you know,\" she said, \"there is the funniest thing at Dovers'.  I\nrode past on the way to Groveville this morning and they have some\nblinds like those you are putting up.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" inquired my mother.  \"Winfield sent us these from New York in\nthe spring, but I thought the hot summer sun would fade them, so I\nsaved them until the fall cleaning.  The wedding coming on makes us a\nlittle early but----\"\n\n\"Well, they may not be exactly the same,\" said the Princess.  \"I only\nsaw from the highway.\"  She meant road; there were many things she said\ndifferently.  \"Have yours big pink roses and silver scrolls inside?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said mother.\n\nThe Princess bubbled until it made you think one of those yellow oriole\nbirds had perched on her saddle.  \"That poor woman has gone and put\nhers up wrong side out.  The effect of all those big pink roses on her\nwhite house front is most amusing.  It looks as if the house were\ncovered with a particularly gaudy piece of comfort calico.  Only fancy!\"\n\nShe laughed again and rode away.  Mother came in just gasping.\n\n\"Well, for all His mercies, large and small, the Lord be praised!\" she\ncried piously, as she dropped into the big rocking chair.  \"THAT is\nwhat I consider escaping by the skin of your teeth!\"\n\nThen father and Laddie laughed, and said they thought so too.  When the\nblinds were up, the outside looked well, and you should have seen the\ninside!  The woodwork was enamelled white, and the wall paper was\nstriped in white and silver.  Every so far on the silver there was a\nlittle pink moss rose having green leaves.  The carpet was plum red and\ngreen in wide stripes, and the lace curtains were freshly washed,\nsnowy, and touched the floor.  The big rocker, the straight-backed\nchairs, and the sofa were beautiful red mahogany wood, and the seats\nshining haircloth.  If no one happened to be looking, you could sit on\na sofa arm, stick your feet out and shoot off like riding down a\nhaystack; the landing was much better.  On the sofa you bounced two\nfeet high the first time; one, the second; and a little way the third.\nOn the haystack, maybe you hit a soft spot, and maybe you struck a\nrock.  Sometimes if you got smart, and tried a new place, and your feet\ncaught in a tangle of weeds and stuck, you came up straight, pitched\nover, and landed on your head.  THEN if you struck a rock, you were\nstill, quite a while.  I was once.  But you never dared let mother see\nyou--on the sofa, I mean; she didn't care about the haystack.\n\nThere were pictures in oval black frames having fancy edges, and a\nwhatnot where all our Christmas and birthday gifts, almost too dainty\nto handle, were kept.  You fairly held your breath when you looked at\nthe nest of spun green glass, with the white dove in it, that George\nWashington Mitchell gave to Shelley.  Of course a dove's nest was never\ndeep, and round, and green, and the bird didn't have red eyes and a\nblack bill.  I thought whoever could blow glass as beautifully as that,\nmight just as easy have made it right while he was at it; but anyway,\nit was pretty.  There were pitchers, mugs, and vases, almost too\ndelicate to touch, and the cloth-covered box with braids of hair coiled\nin wreaths from the heads of the little fever and whooping cough\nsisters.\n\nLaddie asked Sally if she and Peter were going to have the ceremony\nperformed while they sat on the sofa.  Seemed the right place.  They\nhad done all their courting there, even on hot summer days; but I\nsupposed that was because Sally didn't want to be seen fixing Peter's\ntie until she was ready.  She made no bones about it then.  She fixed\nit whenever she pleased; likewise he held her hand.  Shelley said that\nwas disgusting, and you wouldn't catch her.  Leon said he bet a dollar\nhe would; and I said if he knew he'd get beaten as I did, I bet two\ndollars he wouldn't tell what he saw.  The mantel was white, with vases\nof the lovely grasses that grew beside the stream at the foot of the\nBig Hill.  Mother gathered the fanciest every fall, dried them, and\ndipped them in melted alum coloured with copperas, aniline, and indigo.\nThen she took bunches of the colours that went together best and made\nbouquets for the big vases.  They were pretty in the daytime, but at\nnight you could watch them sparkle and shimmer forever.\n\nI always thought the sitting-room was nicer than the parlour.  The\nwoodwork was white enamel there too, but the bureau and chairs were\njust cherry and not too precious to use.  They were every bit as\npretty.  The mantel was much larger.  I could stand up in the\nfireplace, and it took two men to put on an everyday log, four the\nChristmas one.  On each side were the book shelves above, and the linen\nclosets below.  The mantel set between these, and mother always used\nthe biggest, most gorgeous bouquets there, because she had so much\nroom.  The hearth was a slab of stone that came far into the room.  We\ncould sit on it and crack nuts, roast apples, chestnuts, and warm our\ncider, then sweep all the muss we made into the fire.  The wall paper\nwas white and pale pink in stripes, and on the pink were little handled\nbaskets filled with tiny flowers of different colours.  We sewed the\nrags for the carpet ourselves, and it was the prettiest thing.  One\nstripe was wide, all gray, brown, and dull colours, and the other was\npink.  There were green blinds and lace curtains here also, and nice\nbraided rugs that all of us worked on of winter evenings.  Everything\ngot spicker and spanner each day.\n\nMother said there was no use in putting down a carpet in a dining-room\nwhere you constantly fed a host, and the boys didn't clean their feet\nas carefully as they should in winter; but there were useful rags where\nthey belonged, and in our bedroom opening from it also.  The\ndining-room wall paper had a broad stripe of rich cream with pink\ncabbage roses scattered over it and a narrow pink stripe, while the\nwoodwork was something perfectly marvellous.  I didn't know what kind\nof wood it was, but a man who could turn his hand to anything, painted\nit.  First, he put on a pale yellow coat and let it dry.  Then he added\nwood brown, and while it was wet, with a coarse toothed comb, a rag,\nand his fingers, he imitated the grain, the even wood, and knotholes of\ndressed lumber, until many a time I found myself staring steadily at a\nknot to see if a worm wouldn't really come working out.  You have to\nsee a thing like that to understand how wonderful it is.  You couldn't\nsee why they washed the bedding, and took the feathers from the pillows\nand steamed them in mosquito netting bags and dried them in the shade,\nwhen Sally's was to be a morning wedding, but they did.  I even had to\ntake a bucket and gather from around the walls all the little heaps of\nrocks and shells that Uncle Abraham had sent mother from California,\ntake them out and wash and wipe them, and stack them back, with the\nfanciest ones on top.  He sent her a ring made of gold he dug himself.\nShe always kept the ring in a bottle in her bureau, and she meant to\nwear it at the wedding, with her new silk dress.  I had a new dress\ntoo.  I don't know how they got everything done.  All of them worked,\nuntil the last few days they were perfect cross patches.\n\nWhen they couldn't find another thing indoors to scour, they began on\nthe yard, orchard, barn and road.  Mother even had Leon stack the wood\npile straighter.  She said when corded wood leaned at an angle, it made\npeople seem shiftless; and she never passed a place where it looked\nthat way that her fingers didn't just itch to get at it.  He had to\npull every ragweed on each side of the road as far as our land reached,\nand lay every rail straight in the fences.  Father had to take spikes\nand our biggest maul and go to the bridges at the foot of the Big and\nthe Little Hill, and see that every plank was fast, so none of them\nwould rattle when important guests drove across.  She said she just\nsimply wouldn't have them in such a condition that Judge Pettis\ncouldn't hear himself think when he crossed; for you could tell from\nhis looks that it was very important that none of the things he thought\nshould be lost.  There wasn't a single spot about the place inside or\nout that wasn't gone over; and to lots of it you never would have known\nanything had been done if you hadn't seen, because the place was always\nin proper shape anyway; but father said mother acted just like that,\neven when her sons were married at other people's houses; and if she\nkept on getting worse, every girl she married off, by the time she\nreached me, we'd all be scoured threadbare and she'd be on the verge of\nthe grave.  May and I weeded the flowerbeds, picked all the ripe seed,\nand pulled up and burned all the stalks that were done blooming.\nFather and Laddie went over the garden carefully; they scraped the\nwalks and even shook the palings to see if one were going to come loose\nright at the last minute, when every one would be so flustrated there\nwould be no time to fix it.\n\nThen they began to talk about arrangements for the ceremony, whether we\nshould have our regular minister, or Presiding Elder Lemon, and what\npeople they were going to invite.  Just when we had planned to ask\nevery one, have the wedding in the church, and the breakfast at the\nhouse, and all drive in a joyous procession to Groveville to give them\na good send-off in walked Sally.  She had been visiting Peter's people,\nand we planned a lot while she was away.\n\n\"What's going on here?\" she asked, standing in the doorway, dangling\nher bonnet by the ties.\n\nShe never looked prettier.  Her hair had blown out in little curls\naround her face from riding, her cheeks were so pink, and her eyes so\nbright.\n\n\"We were talking about having the ceremony in the church, so every one\ncan be comfortably seated, and see and hear well,\" answered mother.\n\nSally straightened up and began jerking the roses on her bonnet far too\nroughly for artificial flowers.  Perhaps I surprised you with that\nartificial word, but I can spell and define it; it's easy divided into\nsyllables.  Goodness knows, I have seen enough flowers made from the\nhair of the dead, wax, and paper, where you get the shape, but the\ncolour never is right.  These of Sally's were much too bright, but they\nwere better than the ones made at our house.  Hers were of cloth and\nbought at a store.  You couldn't tell why, but Sally jerked her roses;\nI wished she wouldn't, because I very well knew they would be used to\ntrim my hat the next summer, and she said:  \"Well, people don't have to\nbe comfortable during a wedding ceremony; they can stand up if I can,\nand as for seeing and hearing, I'm asking a good many that I don't\nintend to have see or hear either one!\"\n\n\"My soul!\" cried mother, and she dropped her hands and her mouth fell\nopen, like she always told us we never should let ours, while she\nstared at Sally.\n\n\"I don't care!\" said Sally, straightening taller yet; her eyes began to\nshine and her lips to quiver, as if she would cry in a minute; \"I don't\ncare----!\"\n\n\"Which means, my child, that you DO care, very much,\" said father.\n\"Suppose you cease such reckless talk, and explain to us exactly what\nit is that you do want.\"\n\nSally gave her bonnet an awful jerk.  Those roses would look like sin\nbefore my turn to wear them came, and she said:  \"Well then, I do care!\nI care with all my might!  The church is all right, of course; but I\nwant to be married in my very own home!  Every one can think whatever\nthey please about their home, and so can I, and what I think is, that\nthis is the nicest and the prettiest place in all the world, and I\nbelong here----\"\n\n\nFather lifted his head, his face began to shine, and his eyes to grow\nteary; while mother started toward Sally.  She put out her hand and\nheld mother from her at arm's length, and she turned and looked behind\nher through the sitting-room and parlour, and then at us, and she\ntalked so fast you never could have understood what she said if you\nhadn't known all of it anyway, and thought exactly the same thing\nyourself.\n\n\"I have just loved this house ever since it was built,\" she said, \"and\nI've had as good times here as any girl ever had.  If any one thinks\nI'm so very anxious to leave it, and you, and mother, and all the\nothers, why it's a big mistake.  Seems as if a girl is expected to\nmarry and go to a home of her own; it's drummed into her and things\nfixed for her from the day of her birth; and of course I do like Peter,\nbut no home in the world, not even the one he provides for me, will\never be any dearer to me than my own home; and as I've always lived in\nit, I want to be married in it, and I want to stay here until the very\nlast second----\"\n\n\"You shall, my child, you shall!\" sobbed mother.\n\n\"And as for having a crowd of men that father is planning to ask,\nstaring at me, because he changes harvest help and wood chopping with\nthem, or being criticised and clawed over by some women simply because\nthey'll be angry if they don't get the chance, I just won't--so there!\nNot if I have to stand the minister against the wall, and turn our\nbacks to every one.  I think----\"\n\n\"That will do!\" said father, wiping his eyes.  \"That will do, Sally!\nYour mother and I have got a pretty clear understanding of how you\nfeel, now.  Don't excite yourself!  Your wedding shan't be used to pay\noff our scores.  You may ask exactly whom you please, want, and feel\nquite comfortable to have around you----\"\n\nThen Sally fell on mother's neck and every one cried a while; then we\nwiped up, Leon gave Sally his slate, and she came and sat beside the\ntable and began to make out a list of those she really wanted to\ninvite.  First she put down all of our family, even many away in Ohio,\nand all of Peter's, and then his friends, and hers.  Once in the list\nof girls she stopped and said:  \"If I take that beautiful imported\nhandkerchief from Pamela Pryor, I have just got to invite her.\"\n\n\"And she will outdress and outshine you at your own wedding,\" put in\nShelley.\n\n\"Let her, if she can!\" said Sally calmly.  \"She'll have to hump herself\nif she beats that dress of mine; and as for looks, I know lots of\npeople who think gray eyes, pink cheeks, and brown curls far daintier\nand prettier than red cheeks and black eyes and curls.  If she really\nis better looking than I am, it isn't her fault; God made her that way,\nand He wouldn't like us to punish her for it; and it would, because any\none can see she wants to be friends; don't you think, mother?\"--mother\nnodded--\"and besides, I think she's better looking than I am, myself!\"\n\nSally said that, and wrote down the Princess' name in big letters, and\nno one cheeped.\n\nThen she began on our neighbourhood, thinking out loud and writing what\nshe thought.  So all of us were as still, and held our breath in softly\nand waited, and Sally said slow and musing like, \"Of course we couldn't\nhave anything at THIS house without Sarah Hood.  She dressed most of us\nwhen we were born, nursed us when we were sick, helped with threshing,\ncompany, and parties, and she's just splendid anyway; we better ask all\nthe Hoods\"; so she wrote them down.  \"And it will be lonely for Widow\nWillis and the girls to see every one else here--we must have them; and\nof course Deams--Amanda is always such splendid help; and the Widow\nFall is so perfectly lovely, we want her for decorative purposes; and\nwe could scarcely leave out Shaws; they always have all of us\neverything they do; and Dr. Fenner of course; and we'll want Flo and\nAgnes Kuntz to wait on table, so their folks might as well come too----\"\n\nSo she went on taking up each family we knew, and telling what they had\ndone for us, or what we had done for them; and she found some good\nreason for inviting them, and pretty soon father settled back in his\nchair and never took his eyes from Sally's shining head as she bent\nover the slate, and then he began pulling his lower lip, like when it\nwon't behave, and his eyes danced exactly as I've seen Leon's.  I never\nhad noticed that before.\n\nSally went straight on and at last she came to Freshetts.  \"I am going\nto have all of them, too,\" she said.  \"The children are good children,\nand it will help them along to see how things are done when they are\nright; and I don't care what any one says, I LIKE Mrs. Freshett.  I'll\nask her to help work, and that will keep her from talking, and give the\nother women a chance to see that she's clean, and human, and would be a\ngood neighbour if they'd be friendly.  If we ask her, then the others\nwill.\"\n\nWhen she finished--as you live--there wasn't a soul she had left out\nexcept Bill Ramsdell, who starved his dog until it sucked our eggs, and\nIsaac Thomas, who was so lazy he wouldn't work enough to keep his wife\nand children dressed so they ever could go anywhere, but he always\nwent, even with rags flying, and got his stomach full just by talking\nabout how he loved the Lord.  To save me I couldn't see Isaac Thomas\nwithout beginning to myself:\n\n  \"'Tis the voice of the sluggard; I hear him complain,\n  You have waked me too soon, I must slumber again.\n  I passed by his garden, I saw the wild brier,\n  The thorn, and the thistle, grow broader and higher;\n  The clothes that hang on him are turning to rags;\n  And his money he wastes, till he starves or he begs.\"\n\n\nThat described Isaac to the last tatter, only he couldn't waste money;\nhe never had any.  Once I asked father what he thought Isaac would do\nwith it, if by some unforeseen working of Divine Providence, he got ten\ndollars.  Father said he could tell me exactly, because Isaac once sold\nsome timber and had a hundred all at once.  He went straight to town\nand bought Mandy a red silk dress and a brass breastpin, when she had\nno shoes.  He got the children an organ, when they were hungry; and\nhimself a plug hat.  Mandy and the children cried because he forgot\ncandy and oranges until the last cent was gone.  Father said the only\ntime Isaac ever worked since he knew him was when he saw how the hat\nlooked with his rags.  He actually helped the men fell the trees until\nhe got enough to buy a suit, the remains of which he still wore on\nSunday.  I asked father why he didn't wear the hat too, and father said\nthe loss of that hat was a blow, from which Isaac never had recovered.\nOnce at camp-meeting he laid it aside to pray his longest, most\nimpressive prayer, and an affectionate cow strayed up and licked the\nnap all off before Isaac finished, so he never could wear it again.\n\nSally said:  \"I'll be switched if I'll have that disgusting creature\naround stuffing himself on my wedding day; but if you're not in bed,\nwhen it's all over, mother, I do wish you'd send Mandy and the children\na basket.\"\n\nMother promised, and father sat and looked on and pulled his lower lip\nuntil his ears almost wiggled.  Then Sally said she wanted Laddie and\nShelley to stand at the parlour door and keep it tight shut, and seat\nevery one in the sitting-room except a special list she had made out to\nsend in there.  She wanted all our family and Peter's, and only a few\nvery close friends, but it was enough to fill the room.  She said when\nshe and Peter came downstairs every one could see how they looked when\nthey crossed the sitting-room, and for all the difference the door\nwould make, it could be left open then; she would be walled in by\npeople she wanted around her, and the others could have the fun of\nbeing there, seeing what they could, and getting all they wanted to\neat.  Father and mother said that was all right, only to say nothing\nabout the plan to shut the door; but when the time came just to close\nit and everything would be satisfactory.\n\nThen Sally took the slate upstairs to copy the list with ink, so every\none went about something, while mother crossed to father and he took\nher on his lap, and they looked at each other the longest and the\nhardest, and neither of them said a word.  After a while they cried and\nlaughed, and cried some more, and it was about as sensible as what a\nflock of geese say when they are let out of the barn and start for the\nmeadow in the morning.  Then father, all laughy and criey, said:\n\"Thank God!  Oh, thank God, the girl loves the home we have made for\nher!\"\n\nJust said it over and over, and mother kept putting in:  \"It pays,\nPaul!  It pays!\"\n\nNext day Sally put on her riding habit and fixed herself as pretty as\never she could, and went around to have a last little visit with every\none, and invited them herself, and then she wrote letters to people\naway.  Elizabeth and Lucy came home, and every one began to work.\nFather and mother went to the village in the carriage and brought home\nthe bed full of things to eat, and all we had was added, and mother\nbegan to pack butter, and save eggs for cakes, and the day before, I\nthought there wouldn't be a chicken left on the place.  They killed and\nkilled, and Sarah Hood, Amanda Deam, and Mrs. Freshett picked and\npicked.\n\n\"I'll bet a dollar we get something this time besides ribs and neck,\"\nsaid Leon.  \"How do you suppose thigh and breast would taste?\"\n\n\"I was always crazy to try the tail,\" I said.\n\n\"Much chance you got,\" sniggered Leon.  \"'Member the time that father\nasked the Presiding Elder, 'Brother Lemon, what piece of the fowl do\nyou prefer?' and he up and said: 'I'm partial to the rump, Brother\nStanton.'  There sat father bound he wouldn't give him mother's piece,\nso he pretended he couldn't find it, and forked all over the platter\nand then gave him the ribs and the thigh.  Gee, how mother scolded him\nafter the preacher had gone!  You notice father hasn't asked that\nsince.  Now, he always says: 'Do you prefer light or dark meat?'  Much\nchance you have of ever tasting a tail, if father won't even give one\nto the Presiding Elder!\"\n\n\"But as many as they are killing----\"\n\n\"Oh THIS time,\" said Leon with a flourish, \"this time we are going to\nhave livers, and breast, and thighs, AND tails, if you are beholden to\ntail.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know how we are?\"\n\n\"Well, since you have proved that you can keep your mouth shut, for a\nlittle while, anyway, I'm going to take you in on this,\" said Leon.\n\"You keep your eyes on me.  When the wedding gets going good, you watch\nme, and slip out.  That's all!  I'll be fixed to do the rest.  But mind\nthis, get out when I do.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I promised.\n\nThey must have wakened about four o'clock on the wedding day; it wasn't\nreally light when I got up.  I had some breakfast in my night dress,\nand then I was all fixed up in my new clothes, and made to sit on a\nchair, and never move for fear I would soil my dress, for no one had\ntime to do me over, and there was only one dress anyway.  There was so\nmuch to see you could keep interested just watching, and I was as\nanxious to look nice before the boys and girls, and the big people, as\nany one.\n\nEvery mantel and table and bureau was covered with flowers, and you\ncould have smelled the kitchen a mile away, I know.  The dining table\nwas set for the wedding party, our father and mother, and Peter's, and\nthe others had to wait.  You couldn't have laid the flat of your hand\non that table anywhere, it was so covered with things to eat.  Miss\nAmelia, in a dress none of us ever had seen before, a real nice white\ndress, pranced around it and smirked at every one, and waved the\npeacock feather brush to keep the flies from the jelly, preserves, jam,\nbutter, and things that were not cooked.\n\nFor hours Mrs. Freshett had stood in the kitchen on one side of the\nstove frying chicken and heaping it in baking pans in the oven, and\nAmanda Deam on the other, frying ham, while Sarah Hood cooked other\nthings, and made a wash boiler of coffee.  Everything was ready by the\ntime it should have been.  I had watched them until I was tired, when\nSally came through the room where I was, and she said I might come\nalong upstairs and see her dressed.  When we reached the door I\nwondered where she would put me, but she pushed clothing together on a\nbed, and helped me up, and that was great fun.\n\nShe had been bathed and had on her beautiful new linen underclothing\nthat mother punched full of holes and embroidered in flowers and vines,\nand Shelley was brushing her hair when some one called out:  \"The\nPrincess is coming!\"\n\nI jumped for the window, and all of them, even Sally, crowded behind.\nWell, talk about carriages!  No one ever had seen THAT one before.  It\nWAS a carriage.  And such horses!  The funny \"'orse, 'ouse\" man who\nmade the Pryor garden was driving.  He stopped at the gate, got out and\nopened a door, and the Princess' father stepped down, tall and\nstraight, all in shiny black.  He turned around and held out his hand,\nbowing double, and the Princess laid her hand in his and stepped out\ntoo.  He walked with her to the gate, made another bow, kissed her\nhand, and stepped back, and she came down the walk alone.  He got in\nthe carriage, the man closed the door, and they drove away.\n\nSally must have arranged before that the Princess was to come early,\nfor she came straight upstairs.  She wore a soft white silk dress with\nbig faded pink roses in it, and her hair was fastened at each ear with\na bunch of little pink roses.  She was lovely, but she didn't \"outdress\nor outshine\" Sally one bit, and she never even glanced at the mirror to\nsee how she looked; she began helping with Sally's hair, and to dress\nher.  When Bess Kuntz prinked so long she made every one disgusted, the\nPrincess said:  \"Oh save your trouble.  No one will look at you when\nthere's a bride in the house.\"\n\nThere was a roll almost as thick as your arm of garters that all the\nother girls wanted Sally to wear for them so they would get a chance to\nmarry that year, and Agnes Kuntz's was so large it went twice around,\nand they just laughed about it.  They put a blue ribbon on Sally's\nstays for luck, and she borrowed Peter's sister Mary's comb to hold her\nback hair.  They had the most fun, and when she was all ready except\nher dress they went away, and Sally stood in the middle of the room\ntrembling a little.  Outside you could hear carriage wheels rolling,\nthe beat of horses' hoofs, and voices crying greetings.  \"There was a\nsound of revelry,\" by day.  Mother came in hurriedly.  She wore her new\nbrown silk, with a lace collar pinned at the throat with the pin that\nhad a brown goldstone setting in it, and her precious ring was on her\nfinger.  She was dainty and pretty enough to have been a bride herself.\nShe turned Sally around slowly, touching her hair a little and her\nskirts; then she went to the closet, took out the wedding dress, put\nthe skirt over Sally's head, and she came up through the whiteness,\npink and glowing.  She slipped her arms into the sleeves, and mother\nfastened it, shook out the skirt, saw that the bead fringe hung right,\nand the lace collar lay flat, then she took Sally in her arms, held her\ntight and said: \"God bless you, dear, and keep you always.  Amen.\"\n\nThen she stepped to the door, and Peter, all shining and new, came in.\nHe hugged Sally and kissed her like it didn't make the least difference\nwhether she had on calico or a wedding dress, and he just stared, and\nstared at her, and never said a word, so at last she asked:  \"Well\nPeter, do you like my dress?\"\n\nAnd the idiot said:  \"Why Sally, I hadn't even seen it!\"\n\nThen both of them laughed, and the Presiding Elder came.\n\nI never liked to look at him very well because something had happened,\nand he had only one eye.  I always wondered if he had \"plucked it out\"\nbecause it had \"offended\" him; but if you could forget his eye, and\njust listen to his voice, it was like the sweetest music.  He married\nthose two people right there in the bedroom, all but about three words\nat the end.  I heard and saw every bit of it.  Then Sally said it was\ntime for me to go to mother, but she followed me into the boys' room\nand shut the door.  Then she knelt in her beautiful silver dress, and\nput her arms around me and said:  \"Honest, Little Sister, aren't you\ngoing to kiss me goodbye?\"\n\n\"Oh I can if you want me to,\" I said, but I didn't look at her; I\nlooked out of the window.\n\nShe laughed a breathless little catchy sort of laugh and said: \"That's\nexactly what I do want.\"\n\n\"You didn't even want me, to begin with,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"There isn't a doubt but whoever told you that, could have been in\nbetter business,\" said Sally, angry-like.  \"I was much younger then,\nand there were many things I didn't understand, and it wasn't you I\ndidn't want; it was just no baby at all.  I wouldn't have wanted a boy,\nor any other girl a bit more.  I foolishly thought we had children\nenough in this house.  I see now very plainly that we didn't, for this\nfamily never could get along without you, and I'm sorry I ever thought\nso, and I'd give anything if I hadn't struck you and----\"\n\n\"Oh be still, and go on and get married!\" I said.  I could just feel a\nregular beller coming in my throat.  \"I was only fooling to pay you up.\nI meant all the time to kiss you good-bye when the others did.  I'll\nnearly die being lonesome when you're gone----\"\n\nThen I ran for downstairs, and when I reached the door, where the steps\nwent into the sitting-room, I stopped, scared at all the people.  It\nwas like camp-meeting.  You could see the yard full through the\nwindows.  Just as I was thinking I'd go back to the boys' room, and\nfrom there into the garret, and down the back stairway, Laddie went and\nsaw me.  He came over, led me to the parlour door, put me inside, and\nthere mother took my hand and held me tight, and I couldn't see Leon\nanywhere.\n\nI was caught, but they didn't have him.  Mother never hung on as she\ndid that day.  I tried and tried to pull away, and she held tight.  It\nwas only a minute until the door opened, people crowded back, and the\nPresiding Elder, followed by Sally and Peter, came into the room, and\nthey began being married all over again.\n\nIf it hadn't grown so solemn my mother sprung a tear, I never would\nhave made it.  She just had to let me go to sop her face, because tears\nare salty, and they would turn her new brown silk front yellow.  The\nminute my hand was free, I slipped between the people and looked at the\nparlour door.  It was wedged full and more standing on chairs behind\nthem.  No one could get out there.\n\nI thought I would fail Leon sure, and then I remembered the parlour\nbedroom.  I got through that door easy as anything, and it was no trick\nat all to slip behind the blind, raise the window, and drop into\nmother's room from the sill.  From there I reached the back dining-room\ndoor easy enough, went around to the kitchen, and called Leon softly.\nHe opened the door at once and I slipped in.  He had just got there.\nWe looked all around and couldn't see where to begin at first.  There\nwas enough cooked food there to load two wagons.\n\nAn old pillow-case that had dried sage in it was lying across a chair\nand Leon picked it up and poured the sage into the wood-box, and handed\nthe case to me.  He went over and knelt before the oven, while I\nfollowed and held open the case.  Leon rolled his eyes to the ceiling\nand said so exactly like father when he is serving company that not one\nof us could have told the difference:  \"Which part of the fowl do you\nprefer, Brother Lemon?\"\n\nIt was so funny it made me snigger, but I straightened up and answered\nas well as I could:  \"I'm especially fond of the rump, Brother Stanton.\"\n\nLeon stirred the heap and piled four or five tails in the case.  I\nthought that was all I could manage before they would spoil, so I said:\n\"Do you prefer light or dark meat, Sister Abigail?\"\n\n\"I wish to choose breast,\" said Leon, simpering just like that silly\nAbigail Webster.  He put in six breasts.  Then we found them hidden\naway back in the oven in a pie pan, for the bride's table, I bet, and\nwe took two livers apiece; we didn't dare take more for fear they had\nbeen counted.  Then he threw in whatever he came to that was a first\nchoice big piece, until I was really scared, and begged him to stop;\nbut he repeated what the fox said in the story of the \"Quarrelsome\nCocks\"--\"Poco was very good, but I have not had enough yet,\" so he\npiled in pieces until I ran away with the pillow-case; then he slid in\na whole plateful of bread, another of cake, and put the plates in a tub\nof dishes under the table.  Then we took some of everything that wasn't\ntoo runny.  Just then the silence broke in the front part of the house,\nand we scooted from the back door, closing it behind us, ran to the\nwood house and climbed the ladder to the loft over the front part.\nThere we were safe as could be, we could see to the road, hear almost\neverything said in the kitchen, and \"eat our bites in peace,\" like\nPeter Justice told the Presiding Elder at the church trial that he\nwanted his wife to, the time he slapped her.  Before very long, they\nbegan calling us, and called, and called.  We hadn't an idea what they\nwanted, so we ate away.  We heard them first while I was holding over a\nback to let Leon taste kidney, and it made him blink when he got it\ngood.\n\n\"Well my soul!\" he said.  \"No wonder father didn't want to feed that to\nanother man when mother isn't very well, and likes it!  No wonder!\"\n\nThen he gave me a big bite of breast.  It was sort of dry and\ntasteless; I didn't like it.\n\n\"Why, I think neck or back beats that all to pieces!\" I said in\nsurprise.\n\n\"Fact is, they do!\" said Leon.  \"I guess the people who 'wish to choose\nbreast,' do it to get the biggest piece.\"\n\nI never had thought of it before, but of course that would be the\nreason.\n\n\"Allow me, Sister Stanton,\" said Leon, holding out a piece of thigh.\n\nThat was really chicken!  Then we went over the backs and picked out\nall the kidneys, and ate the little crusty places, and all the cake we\ncould swallow; then Leon fixed up the bag the best he could, and set it\ninside an old cracked churn and put on the lid.\n\nHe said that would do almost as well as the cellar, and the food would\nkeep until to-morrow.  I wanted to slip down and put it in the\nUnderground Station; but Leon said father must be spending a lot of\nmoney right now, and he might go there to get some, so that wouldn't be\nsafe.  Then he cleaned my face, and I told him when he got his right,\nand we slipped from the back door, crossed the Lawton blackberry patch,\nand went to the house from the orchard.  Leon took an apple and broke\nit in two, and we went in eating as if we were starving.  When father\nasked us where in this world we had been, Leon told him we thought it\nwould be so awful long before the fourth or fifth table, and we hadn't\nhad much breakfast, and we were so hungry we went and hunted something\nto eat.\n\n\"If you'd only held your horses a minute,\" said father; \"they were\ncalling you to take places at the bride's table.\"\n\nWell for land's sake!  Our mouths dropped open until it's a wonder the\ncake and chicken didn't show, and we never said a word.  There didn't\nseem to be anything to say, for Leon loved to be with grown folks, and\nto have eaten at the bride's table would have been the biggest thing\nthat ever happened to me.  At last, when I could speak, I asked who had\ntaken our places, and bless your heart if it wasn't that mealy-faced\nlittle sister of Peter's, and one of the aunts from Ohio.  They had\nfinished, and Sally was upstairs putting on her travelling dress, while\nthe guests were eating, when I heard Laddie ask the Princess to ride\nwith him and Sally's other friends, who were going to escort her to the\ndepot.\n\n\"You'll want all your horses.  What could I ride?\"\n\n\"If I find you a good horse and saddle will you go?\"\n\n\"I will.  I think it would be fine sport.\"\n\nLaddie turned and went from sight that minute.  The Princess laughed\nand kept on making friends with every one, helping wait on people,\nthinking of nice things to do, and just as the carriage was at the gate\nfor father and mother, and Sally and Peter, and every one else was\nuntying their horses to ride in the procession to the village, from\nwhere I was standing on the mounting block I saw something coming down\nthe Little Hill.  I took one look, ran to the Princess, and almost\ndragged her.\n\nUp raced Laddie, his face bright, his eyes snapping with fun.  He rode\nFlos, was leading the Princess' horse Maud, and carrying a big bundle\nunder his arm.  He leaped from the saddle and fastened both horses.\n\n\"Gracious Heaven!  What have you done?\" gasped the Princess.\n\n\"Brought your mount,\" said Laddie, quite as if he were used to going to\nPryors' after the sausage grinder or the grain sacks.  But the Princess\nwas pale and trembling.  She stepped so close she touched him, and he\nimmediately got a little closer.  You couldn't get ahead of Laddie, and\nhe didn't seem to care who saw, and neither did she.\n\n\"Tell me exactly what occurred,\" she said, just as father does when he\nmeans to whale us completely.\n\n\"I rapped at the front door,\" said Laddie.\n\n\"And who opened it?\" cried the Princess.\n\n\"Your father!\"\n\n\"My father?\"\n\n\"Yes, your father!\" said Laddie.  \"And because I was in such a hurry, I\ndidn't wait for him to speak.  I said:  'Good morning, Mr. Pryor.  I'm\none of the Stanton boys, and I came for Miss Pryor's mount and habit.\nAll the young people who are on horseback are going to ride an escort\nto the village, around my sister's bridal carriage, and Miss Pryor\nthinks she would enjoy going.  Please excuse such haste, but we only\nthis minute made the plan, and the train won't wait.'\"\n\n\"And he?\"\n\n\"He said:  'Surely!  Hold one minute.'  I stood on the step and waited,\nand I could hear him give the order to some one to get your riding\nhabit quickly, and then he blew a shrill whistle, and your horse was at\nthe gate the fastest of anything I ever saw.\"\n\n\"Did he do or say----\"\n\n\"Nothing about 'clods, and clowns, and grossness!'  Every other word he\nspoke was when I said, 'Thank you, and good morning,' and was turning\naway.  He asked:  'Did Miss Pryor say whether she preferred to ride\nhome, or shall I escort her in the carriage?'\"\n\n\"'She did not,' I answered.  'The plan was so sudden she had no time to\nthink that far.  But since she will have her horse and habit, why not\nallow my father to escort her?'  So you see, I'm going to take you\nhome,\" exulted Laddie.\n\n\"But you told him your FATHER,\" said the Princess.\n\n\"And thereby created the urgent necessity,\" said Laddie with a\nflourish, \"for speaking to him again, and telling him that my father\nhad visitors from Ohio, and couldn't leave them.  We will get all the\nfun from the day that we can; but before dusk, too early for them to\nhave any cause for cavil, 'the gross country clod' is going to take you\nhome!\"\n\nOne at a time, Laddie pounded those last words into the hitching post,\nwith his doubled fist.\n\n\"Suppose he sets the dogs on you!  You know he keeps two dreadful ones.\"\n\nLaddie just roared.  He leaned closer.\n\n\"Beaucheous Lady,\" he said, \"I have fed those same dogs and rubbed\ntheir ears so many nights lately, he'll get the surprise of his life if\nhe tries that.\"\n\nThe Princess drew away and stared at Laddie the funniest.\n\n\"On my life!\" she said at last.  \"Well for a country clod----!\"\n\nThen she turned with the habit bundle, and ran into the house.  Father\nand mother came from the front door arm in arm and walked to the\ncarriage, and Sally and Peter followed.  My, but they looked fine!  The\nPrincess had gone to the garden and gathered flowers and lined all the\nchildren in rows down each side of the walk.  They were loaded with\nblooms to throw at Sally; but when she came out, in her beautiful gray\npoplin travelling dress, trimmed in brown ribbon, the same shade as her\ncurls, her face all pink, her eyes shining, and the ties of her little\nbrown bonnet waving to her waist, she was so perfectly beautiful, every\nsingle child watched her open mouthed, gripped its flowers, and forgot\nto throw them at all.\n\nAnd this you scarcely will believe after what she had said the day she\nmade her list, and when all of us knew her heart was all torn up, Sally\njust swept along smiling at every one and calling \"good-bye\" to those\nwho had no way to ride to the village, as if leaving didn't amount to\nmuch.  At the carriage, a little white, but still smiling, she turned\nand took one long look at everything, and then she got in and called\nfor me, right out loud before every one, so I got to hold up my head as\nhigh as it would go, and step in too, and ride all the way to\nGroveville between her and Peter, and instead of holding his hand, she\nheld mine, just gripped it tight.  She gripped so hard she squeezed all\nthe soreness at her from my heart, and when she kissed me good-bye the\nvery last of all, I whispered in her ear that I wouldn't ever be angry\nany more, and I wasn't, because after she had explained I saw how it\nhad been.  It wasn't ME she didn't want; it was just no baby.\n\nAfter our carriage came Peter's people, then one father borrowed for\nthe Ohio relatives, then the other children, and all the neighbours\nfollowed, and when we reached the high hill where you turn beside the\nwoods, I saw father gather up the lines and brace himself, for Ned and\nJo were what he called \"mettlesome.\"  \"Then came a burst of thunder\nsound,\" as it says in \"Casablanca,\" and the horseback riders came\nsweeping around us, Laddie and the Princess leading.  These two rode\nahead of us, and the others lined three deep on either side, and the\nnext carriage dropped back and let them close in behind, so Sally and\nPeter were \"in the midst thereof.\"  Instead of throwing old shoes, as\nalways had been done, the Princess coaxed them to throw rice and roses,\nand every other flower pulled from the bouquets at home, and from the\ngardens we had passed.  Every one was out watching us go by, and when\nWilliam Justus rode beside the fences crying, \"Flowers for the bride!\nGive us flowers for the bride!\" some of the women were so excited they\npulled things up by the roots and gave him armloads, and he rode ahead\nand supplied Laddie and the Princess, and they kept scattering them in\nthe road until every foot of the way to Groveville was covered with\nflowers, \"the fair young flowers that lately sprang and stood.\"  He\neven made side-cuts into swampy places and gathered armloads of those\nperfectly lovely, fringy blue gentians, caught up, and filled the\ncarriage and scattered them in a wicked way, because you should only\ntake a few of those rare, late flowers that only grow from seed.\n\nSally looked just as if she had come into her own and was made for it;\nI never did see her look so pretty, but Peter sweated and acted awful\nsilly.  Father had a time with the team.  Ned and Jo became excited and\njust ranted.  They simply danced.  Laddie had braided their manes and\ntails, and they waved like silken floss in the sunshine, and the\ncarriage was freshly washed and the patent leather and brass shone, and\nwe rode flower-covered.  Ahead, Laddie and the Princess fairly tried\nthemselves.  She hadn't put on her hat or habit after all.  When Laddie\ntold her they were going to lead, she said:  \"Very well!  Then I shall\ngo as I am.  The dress makes no difference.  It's the first time I've\nhad a chance to spoil one since I left England.\"\n\nWhen the other girls saw what she was going to do, nearly every one of\nthem left off their hats and riding skirts.  Every family had saddle\nhorses those days, and when the riders came racing up they looked like\nflying flowers, they were all laughing, bloom ladened, singing and\ncalling jokes.  Ahead, Laddie and the Princess just plain showed off.\nHer horse came from England with them, and Laddie said it had Arab\nblood in it, like the one in the Fourth Reader poem, \"Fret not to roam\nthe desert now, With all thy winged speed,\" and the Princess loved her\nhorse more than that man did his.  She said she'd starve before she'd\nsell it, and if her family were starving, she'd go to work and earn\nfood for them, and keep her horse.  Laddie's was a Kentucky\nthoroughbred he'd saved money for years to buy; and he took a young one\nand trained it himself, almost like a circus horse.  Both of them COULD\nride; so that day they did.  They ran those horses neck and neck, right\nup the hill approaching Groveville, until they were almost from sight,\nthen they whirled and came sweeping back fast as the wind.  The\nPrincess' eyes were like dead coals, and her black curls streamed, the\nthin silk dress wrapped tight around her and waved back like a gossamer\nweb such as spiders spin in October.  Laddie's hair was blowing, his\ncheeks and eyes were bright, and with one eye on the Princess--she\ndidn't need it--and one on the road, he cut curves, turned, wheeled,\nand raced, and as he rode, so did she.\n\n\"Will they break their foolish necks?\" wailed mother.\n\n\"They are the handsomest couple I ever have seen in my life!\" said\nfather.\n\n\"Yes, and you two watch out, or you'll strike trouble right there,\"\nsaid Sally, leaning forward.\n\nI gave her an awful nudge.  It made me so happy I could have screamed\nto see them flying away together like that.\n\n\"Well, if that girl represents trouble,\" said father, \"God knows it\nnever before came in such charming guise.\"\n\n\"You can trust a man to forget his God and his immortal soul if a\nsufficiently beautiful woman comes along,\" said my mother dryly, and\nall of them laughed.\n\nShe didn't mean that to be funny, though.  You could always tell by the\nset of her lips and the light in her eyes.\n\nJust this side of Groveville we passed a man on horseback.  He took off\nhis hat and drew his horse to one side when Laddie and the Princess\nrode toward him.  He had a big roll of papers under his arm, to show\nthat he had been for his mail.  But I knew, so did Laddie and the\nPrincess, that he had been compelled to saddle and ride like mad, to\nreach town and come that far back in time to watch us pass; for it was\nthe Princess' father, and WATCH was exactly what he was doing; he\nwanted to see for himself.  Laddie and the Princess rode straight at\nhim, neck and neck, and then both of them made their horses drop on\ntheir knees and they waved a salute, and then they were up and away.\nOf course father and mother saw, so mother bowed, and father waved his\nwhip as we passed.  He sat there like he'd turned the same on horseback\nas Sabethany had in her coffin; but he had to see almost a mile of us\ndriving our best horses and carriages, wearing our wedding garments and\nfine raiment, and all that \"cavalcade,\" father called it, of young,\nreckless riders.  You'd have thought if there were a hint of a smile in\nhis whole being it would have shown when Sally leaned from the carriage\nto let him see that her face and clothes were as good as need be and\nsmiled a lovely smile on him, and threw him a rose.  He did leave his\nhat off and bow low, and then Shelley, always the very dickens for\ndaring, rode right up to him and laughed in his face, and she leaned\nand thrust a flower into his bony hands; you would have thought he\nwould have been simply forced to smile then, but he looked far more as\nif he would tumble over and roll from the saddle.  My heart ached for a\nman in trouble like that.  I asked the Lord to preserve us from secrets\nwe couldn't tell the neighbours!\n\nAt the station there wasn't a thing those young people didn't do.\n\nThey tied flowers and ribbons all over Sally's satchel and trunk.\n\nThey sowed rice as if it were seeding time in a wheatfield.  They\nformed a circle around Sally and Peter and as mushy as ever they could\nthey sang, \"As sure as the grass grows around the stump, You are my\ndarling sugar lump,\" while they danced.  They just smiled all the time\nno matter what was done to them.  Some of it made me angry, but I\nsuppose to be pleasant was the right way.  Sally was strong on always\ndoing the right thing, so she just laughed, and so did all of us.\nGoing home it was wilder yet, for all of them raced and showed how they\ncould ride.\n\nAt the house people were hungry again, so the table was set and they\nate up every scrap in sight, and Leon and I ate with them that time and\nsaved ours.  Then one by one the carriages, spring wagons, and\nhorseback riders went away, all the people saying Sally was the\nloveliest bride, and hers had been the prettiest wedding they'd ever\nseen, and the most good things to eat, and Laddie and the Princess went\nwith them.  When the last one was gone, and only the relatives from\nOhio were left, mother pitched on the bed, gripped her hands and cried\nas if she'd go to pieces, and father cried too, and all of us, even\nMrs. Freshett, who stayed to wash up the dishes.  She was so tickled to\nbe there, and see, and help, that mother had hard work to keep her from\nwashing the linen that same night.  She did finish the last dish, scrub\nthe kitchen floor, black the stove, and pack all the borrowed china in\ntubs, ready to be taken home, and things like that.  Mother said it was\na burning shame for any neighbourhood to let a woman get so starved out\nand lonesome she'd act that way.  She said enough was enough, and when\nMrs. Freshett had cooked all day, and washed dishes until the last\nskillet was in place, she had done as much as any neighbour ought to\ndo, and the other things she went on and did were a rebuke to us.\n\nI felt sore, weepy, and tired out.  It made me sick to think of the\nsage bag in the cracked churn, so I climbed my very own catalpa tree in\nthe corner, watched up the road for Laddie, and thought things over.\nIf I ever get married I want a dress, and a wedding exactly like that,\nbut I would like a man quite different from Peter; like Laddie would\nsuit me better.  When he rode under the tree, I dropped from a limb\ninto his arms, and went with him to the barn.  He asked me what was\ngoing on at the house, and I told him about Mrs. Freshett being a\nrebuke to us; and Laddie said she was, and he didn't believe one word\nagainst her.  When I told him mother was in bed crying like anything,\nhe said:  \"I knew that had to come when she kept up so bravely at the\nstation.  Thank the Lord, she showed her breeding by holding in until\nshe got where she had a right to cry if she pleased.\"\n\nThen I whispered for fear Leon might be around:  \"Did he set the dogs\non you?\"\n\n\"He did not,\" said Laddie, laughing softly.\n\n\"Did he call you names again?\"\n\n\"He did!\" said Laddie, \"but I started it.  You see, when we got there,\nThomas was raking the grass and he came to take the Princess' horse.\nHer father was reading on a bench under a tree.  I helped her down, and\nwalked with her to the door and said good-bye, and thanked her for the\npleasure she had added to the day for us, loudly enough that he could\nhear; then I went over to him and said:  'Good evening, Mr. Pryor.  If\nmy father knew anything about it, he would very much regret that\ncompany from Ohio detained him and compelled me to escort your daughter\nhome.  He would greatly have enjoyed the privilege, but I honestly\nbelieve that I appreciated it far more than he could.'\"\n\n\"Oh Laddie, what did he say?\"\n\n\"He arose and glared at me, and choked on it, and he tried several\ntimes, until I thought the clods were going to fly again, but at last\nhe just spluttered:  'You blathering rascal, you!' That was such a\ncompliment compared with what I thought he was going to say that I had\nto laugh.  He tried, but he couldn't keep from smiling himself, and\nthen I said:  'Please think it over, Mr. Pryor, and if you find that\nMiss Pryor has had an agreeable, entertaining day, won't you give your\nconsent for her to come among us again?  Won't you allow me to come\nhere, if it can be arranged in such a way that I intrude on no one?'\"\n\n\"Oh Laddie!\"\n\n\"He exploded in a kind of a snarl that meant, I'll see you in the Bad\nPlace first.  So I said to him:  'Thank you very much for to-day,\nanyway.  I'm sure Miss Pryor has enjoyed this day, and it has been the\nhappiest of my life--one to be remembered always.  Of course I won't\ncome here if I am unwelcome, but I am in honour bound to tell you that\nI intend to meet your daughter elsewhere, whenever I possibly can.  I\nthought it would be a better way for you to know and have us where you\ncould see what was going on, if you chose, than for us to meet without\nyour knowledge.\"\n\n\"Oh Laddie,\" I wailed, \"now you've gone and ruined everything!\"\n\n\"Not so bad as that, Little Sister,\" laughed Laddie.  \"Not half so bad!\nHe exploded in another growl, and he shook his walking stick at me, and\nhe said--guess what he said.\"\n\n\"That he would kill you,\" I panted, clinging to him.\n\n\"Right!\" said Laddie.  \"You have it exactly.  He said:  'Young man,\nI'll brain you with my walking stick if ever I meet you anywhere with\nmy daughter, when you have not come to her home and taken her with my\npermission.'\"\n\n\"What!\" I stammered.  \"What!  Oh Laddie, say it over!  Does it\nmean----?\"\n\n\"It means,\" said Laddie, squeezing me until I was near losing my\nbreath, \"it means, Little Sister, that I shall march to his door and\nask him squarely, and if it is anywhere the Princess wants to go, I\nshall take her.\"\n\n\"Like, 'See the conquering hero comes?'\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" laughed Laddie.\n\n\"What will mother say?\"\n\n\"She hasn't made up her mind yet,\" answered Laddie.\n\n\"Do you mean----?\" I gasped again.\n\n\"Of course!\" said Laddie.  \"I wasn't going to let a girl get far ahead\nof me.  The minute I knew she had told her mother, I told mine the very\nfirst chance.\"\n\n\"Mother knows that you feel about the Princess as father does about\nher?\"\n\n\"Mother knows,\" answered Laddie, \"and so does father.  I told both of\nthem.\"\n\nBoth of them knew!  And it hadn't made enough difference that any one\nliving right with them every day could have told it.  Time and work\nwill be needed to understand grown people.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe Shropshire and the Crusader\n\n  \"For, among the rich and gay,\n    Fine, and grand, and decked in laces,\n  None appear more glad then they,\n    With happier hearts, or happier faces.\"\n\n\nEvery one told mother for a week before the wedding that she would be\nsick when it was over, and sure enough she was.  She had been on her\nfeet too much, and had so many things to think about, and there had\nbeen such a dreadful amount of work for her and Candace, even after all\nthe neighbours helped, that she was sick in bed and we couldn't find a\nthing she could eat, until she was almost wild with hunger and father\nseemed as if he couldn't possibly bear it a day longer.\n\nAfter Candace had tried everything she could think of, I went up and\ntalked it over with Sarah Hood, and she came down, pretending she\nhappened in, and she tried thickened milk, toast and mulled buttermilk;\nshe kept trying for two days before she gave up.  Candace thought of\nnew things, and Mrs. Freshett came and made all the sick dishes she\nknew, but mother couldn't even taste them; so we were pretty blue, and\nwe nearly starved ourselves, for how could we sit and eat everything\nyou could mention, and mother lying there, almost crying with hunger?\n\nSaturday morning I was hanging around her room hoping maybe she could\nthink of some least little thing I could do for her, even if no more\nthan to bring a glass of water, or a late rose to lay on her pillow; it\nwould be better than not being able to do anything at all.  After a\nwhile she opened her eyes and looked at me, and I scarcely knew her.\nShe smiled the bravest she could and said:  \"Sorry for mother, dear?\"\n\nI nodded.  I couldn't say much, and she tried harder than ever to be\ncheerful and asked:  \"What are you planning to do to-day?\"\n\n\"If you can't think of one thing I can do for you, guess I'll go\nfishing,\" I said.\n\nHer eyes grew brighter and she seemed half interested.\n\n\"Why, Little Sister,\" she said, \"if you can catch some of those fish\nlike you do sometimes, I believe I could eat one of them.\"\n\nI never had such a be-hanged time getting started.  I slipped from the\nroom, and never told a soul even where I was going.  I fell over the\nshovel and couldn't find anything quick enough but my pocket to put the\nworms in, and I forgot my stringer.  At last, when I raced down the\nhill to the creek and climbed over the water of the deep place, on the\nroots of the Pete Billings yowling tree, I had only six worms, my apple\nsucker pole, my cotton cord line, and bent pin hook.  I put the first\nworm on carefully, and if ever I prayed!  Sometimes it was hard to\nunderstand about this praying business.  My mother was the best and\nmost beautiful woman who ever lived.  She was clean, and good, and\nalways helped \"the poor and needy who cluster round your door,\" like it\nsays in the poetry piece, and there never could have been a reason why\nGod would want a woman to suffer herself, when she went flying on\nhorseback even dark nights through rain or snow, to doctor other\npeople's pain, and when she gave away things like she did--why, I've\nseen her take a big piece of meat from the barrel, and a sack of meal,\nand heaps of apples and potatoes to carry to Mandy Thomas--when she\ngave away food by the wagonload at a time, God couldn't have WANTED her\nto be hungry, and yet she WAS that very minute almost crying for food;\nand I prayed, oh how I did pray! and a sneaking old back-ended crayfish\ntook my very first worm.  I just looked at the sky and said:  \"Well,\nwhen it's for a sick woman, can't You do any better than that?\"\n\nI suppose I shouldn't have said it, but if it had been your mother, how\nwould you have felt?  I pinched the next worm in two, so if a crayfish\ntook that, it wouldn't get but half.  I lay down across the roots and\npulled my bonnet far over my face and tried to see to the bottom.  I\nread in school the other day:\n\n  \"And by those little rings on the water I know\n   The fishes are merrily swimming below.\"\n\n\nThere were no rings on the water, but after a while I saw some fish\ndarting around, only they didn't seem to be hungry; for they would come\nright up and nibble a tiny bit at my worm, but they wouldn't swallow\nit.  Then one did, so I jerked with all my might, jerked so hard the\nfish and worm both flew off, and I had only the hook left.  I put on\nthe other half and tried again.  I prayed straight along, but the tears\nwould come that time, and the prayer was no powerful effort like\nBrother Hastings would have made; it was little torn up pieces mostly:\n\"O Lord, please do make only one fish bite!\"  At last one did bite\ngood, so I swung carefully that time, and landed it on the grass, but\nit was so little and it hit a stone and was killed.  I had no stringer\nto put it back in the water to keep cool, and the sun was hot that day,\nlike times in the fall.  Stretched on the roots, with it shining on my\nback, and striking the water and coming up from below, I dripped with\nheat and excitement.\n\nI threw that one away, put on another worm, and a big turtle took it,\nthe hook, and broke my line, and almost pulled me in.  I wouldn't have\nlet go if it had, for I just had to have a fish.  There was no help\nfrom the Lord in that, so I quit praying, only what I said when I\ndidn't know it.  Father said man was born a praying animal, and no\nmatter how wicked he was, if he had an accident, or saw he had just got\nto die, he cried aloud to the Lord for help and mercy before he knew\nwhat he was doing.\n\nI could hear the roosters in the barnyard, the turkey gobbler, and the\nold ganders screamed once in a while, and sometimes a bird sang a\nskimpy little fall song; nothing like spring, except the killdeers and\nlarks; they were always good to hear--and then the dinner bell rang.  I\nwished I had been where I couldn't have heard that, because I didn't\nintend going home until I had a fish that would do for mother if I\nstayed until night.  If the best one in the family had to starve, we\nmight as well all go together; but I wouldn't have known how hungry I\nwas, if the bell hadn't rung and told me the others were eating.  So I\nbent another pin and tried again.  I lost the next worm without knowing\nhow, and then I turned baby and cried right out loud.  I was so\nthirsty, the salty tears running down my cheeks tasted good, and doing\nsomething besides fishing sort of rested me; so I looked around and up\nat the sky, wiped my face on the skirt of my sunbonnet, and put on\nanother worm.  I had only one more left, and I began to wonder if I\ncould wade in and catch a fish by hand; I did teeny ones sometimes, but\nI knew the water there was far above my head, for I had measured it\noften with the pole; it wouldn't do to try that; instead of helping\nmother any, a funeral would kill her, too, so I fell back on the\nCrusaders, and tried again.\n\nStrange how thinking about them helped.  I pretended I was fighting my\nway to the Holy City, and this was the Jordan just where it met the\nsea, and I had to catch enough fish to last me during the pilgrimage\nwest or I'd never reach Jerusalem to bring home a shell for the Stanton\ncrest.  I pretended so hard, that I got braver and stronger, and asked\nthe Lord more like there was some chance of being heard.  All at once\nthere was a jerk that almost pulled me in, so I jerked too, and a big\nfish flew over my head and hit the bank behind me with a thump.  Of\ncourse by a big fish I don't mean a red horse so long as my arm, like\nthe boys bring from the river; I mean the biggest fish I ever caught\nwith a pin in our creek.  It looked like the whale that swallowed\nJonah, as it went over my head.  I laid the pole across the roots,\njumped up and turned, and I had to grab the stump to keep from falling\nin the water and dying.  There lay the fish, the biggest one I ever had\nseen, but it was flopping wildly, and it wasn't a foot from a hole in\nthe grass where a muskrat had burrowed through.  If it gave one flop\nthat way, it would slide down the hole straight back into the water;\nand between me and the fish stood our cross old Shropshire ram.  I\nalways looked to see if the sheep were in the meadow before I went to\nthe creek, but that morning I had been so crazy to get something for\nmother to eat, I never once thought of them--and there it stood!\n\nThat ram hadn't been cross at first, and father said it never would be\nif treated right, and not teased, and if it were, there would be\ntrouble for all of us.  I was having more than my share that minute,\nand it bothered me a lot almost every day.  I never dared enter a field\nany more if it were there, and now it was stamping up and down the\nbank, shaking its head, and trying to get me; with one flop the fish\nwent ALMOST in the hole, and the next a little away from it.\nEverything put together, I thought I couldn't stand it.  I never wanted\nanything as I wanted that fish, and I never hated anything as I hated\nthat sheep.  It wasn't the sheep's fault either; Leon teased it on\npurpose, just to see it chase Polly Martin; but that was more her\ndoings than his.\n\nShe was a widow and she crossed our front meadow going to her sister's.\nShe had two boys big as Laddie, and three girls, and father said they\nlived like \"the lilies of the field; they toiled not, neither did they\nspin.\"  They never looked really hungry or freezing, but they never\nplowed, or planted, they had no cattle or pigs or chickens, only a\nlittle corn for meal, and some cabbage, and wild things they shot for\nmeat, and coons to trade the skins for more powder and lead--bet they\nate the coons--never any new clothes, never clean, they or their house.\nOnce when father and mother were driving past, they saw Polly at the\nwell and they stopped for politeness sake to ask how she was, like they\nalways did with every one.  Polly had a tin cup of water and was\nsopping at her neck with a carpet rag, and when mother asked, \"How are\nyou, Mrs. Martin?\" she answered:  \"Oh I ain't very well this spring; I\ngest I got the go-backs!\"\n\nMother said Polly looked as if she'd been born with the \"go-backs,\" and\nhad given them to all her children, her home, garden, fields, and even\nthe FENCES.  We hadn't a particle of patience with such people.  When\nyou are lazy like that it is very probable that you'll live to see the\nday when your children will peep through the fence cracks and cry for\nbread.  I have seen those Martin children come mighty near doing it\nwhen the rest of us opened our dinner baskets at school; and if mother\nhadn't always put in enough so that we could divide, I bet they would.\nIf Polly Martin had walked up as if she were alive, and had been washed\nand neat, and going somewhere to do some one good, Leon never would\nhave dreamed of such a thing as training the Shropshire to bunt her.\nShe was so long and skinny, always wore a ragged shawl over her head, a\nfloppy old dress that the wind whipped out behind, and when she came to\nthe creek, she sat astride the foot log, and hunched along with her\nhands; that tickled the boys so, Leon began teasing the sheep on\npurpose to make it get her.  But inasmuch as she saw fit to go abroad\nlooking so funny, that any one could see she'd be a perfect circus if\nshe were chased, I didn't feel that it was Leon's fault.  If, like the\nlittle busy bee, she had \"improved each shining hour,\" he never would\nhave done it.  Seems to me, she brought the trouble on her own head.\n\nFirst, Leon ran at the Shropshire and then jumped aside; but soon it\ngrew so strong and quick he couldn't manage that, so he put his hat on\na stick and poked it back and forth through a fence crack, and that\nmade the ram raving mad.  At last it would butt the fence until it\nwould knock itself down, and if he dangled the hat again, get right up\nand do it over.  Father never caught Leon, so he couldn't understand\nwhat made the sheep so dreadfully cross, because he had thought it was\nquite peaceable when he bought it.  The first time it got after Polly,\nshe threw her shawl over its head, pulled up her skirts, and Leon said\nshe hit just eleven high places crossing an eighty-acre field; she came\nto the house crying, and father had to go after her shawl, and mother\ngave her a roll of butter and a cherry pie to comfort her.\n\nThe Shropshire never really got Polly, but any one could easily see\nwhat it would do to me if I dared step around that stump, and it was\ndancing and panting to begin.  If whoever wrote that \"Gentle Sheep,\npray tell me why,\" piece ever had seen a sheep acting like that, it\nwouldn't have been in the books; at least I think it wouldn't, but one\ncan't be sure.  He proved that he didn't know much about anything\noutdoors or he wouldn't have said that sheep were \"eating grass and\ndaisies white, from the morning till the night,\" when daisies are\nbitter as gall.\n\nFlop! went the fish, and its tail touched the edge of the hole.  Then I\nturned around and picked up the pole.  I put my sunbonnet over the big\nend of it, and poked it at the ram, and drew it back as Leon did his\nhat.  One more jump and mother's fish would be gone.  I stood on the\nroots and waved my bonnet.  The sheep lowered its head and came at it\nwith a rush.  I drew back the pole, and the sheep's forefeet slid over\nthe edge, and it braced and began to work to keep from going in.  The\nfish gave a big flop and went down the hole.  Then I turned Crusader\nand began to fight, and I didn't care if I were whipped black and blue,\nI meant to finish that old black-faced Shropshire.  I set the pole on\nthe back of its neck and pushed with all my might, and I got it in,\ntoo.  My, but it made a splash!  It wasn't much good at swimming\neither, and it had no chance, for I stood on the roots and pushed it\ndown, and hit it over the nose with all my might, and I didn't care how\nfar it came on the cars, or how much money it cost, it never would\nchase me, and make me lose my fish again.\n\nI didn't hear him until he splashed under the roots and then I was so\nmad I didn't see that it was Laddie; I only knew that it was someone\nwho was going to help out that miserable ram, so I struck with all my\nmight, the sheep when I could hit it, if not, the man.\n\n\"You little demon, stop!\" cried Laddie.\n\nI got in a good one right on the ram's nose.  Then Laddie dropped the\nsheep and twisted the fish pole from my fingers, and I pushed him as\nhard as I could, but he was too strong.  He lifted the sheep, pulled it\nto the bank, and rolled it, worked its jaws, and squeezed water from\nit, and worked and worked.\n\n\"I guess you've killed it!\" he said at last.\n\n\"Goody!\" I shouted.  \"Goody!  Oh but I am glad it's dead!\"\n\n\"What on earth has turned you to a fiend?\" asked Laddie, beginning work\non the sheep again.\n\n\"That ram!\" I said.  \"Ever since Leon made it cross so it would chase\nPolly Martin, it's got me oftener than her.  I can't go anywhere for\nit, and to-day it made me lose a big fish, and mother is waiting.  She\nthought maybe she could eat some.\"\n\nThen I roared; bet I sounded like Bashan's bull.\n\n\"Dear Lord!\" said Laddie dropping the sheep and taking me in his wet\narms.  \"Tell me, Biddy!  Tell me how it is.\"\n\nThen I forgot I was a Crusader, and told him all about it as well as I\ncould for choking, and when I finished he bathed my hot face, and\nhelped me from the roots.  Then he went and looked down the hole I\nshowed him and he cried out quicklike, and threw himself on the grass,\nand in a second up came the fish.  Some one had rolled a big stone in\nthe hole, so the fish was all right, not even dead yet, and Laddie said\nit was the biggest one he ever had seen taken from the creek.  Then he\nsaid if I'd forgive him and all our family, for spoiling the kind of a\nlife I had a perfect right to lead, and if I'd run to the house and get\na big bottle from the medicine case quick, he would see to it that some\nplace was fixed for that sheep where it would never bother me again.\nSo I took the fish and ran as fast as I could, but I sent May back with\nthe bottle, and did the scaling myself.  No one at our house could do\nit better, for Laddie taught me the right way long ago, when I was\nsmall, and I'd done it hundreds of times.\n\nThen I went to Candace and she put a little bit of butter and a speck\nof lard in a skillet, and cooked the fish brown.  She made a slice of\ntoast and boiled a cup of water and carried it to the door; then she\nwent in and set the table beside the bed, and I took in the tray, and\ndidn't spill a drop.  Mother never said a word; she just reached out\nand broke off a tiny speck and nibbled it, and it stayed; she tried a\nlittle bigger piece, and another, and she said:  \"Take out the bones,\nCandace!\"  She ate every scrap of that fish like the hungriest\ntraveller who ever came to our door, and the toast, and drank the hot\nwater.  Then she went into a long sleep and all of us walked tiptoe,\nand when she waked up she was better, and in a few days she could sit\nin her chair again, and she began getting Shelley ready to go to music\nschool.\n\nI have to tell you the rest, too.  Laddie made the ram come alive, and\nfather sold it the next day for more than he paid for it.  He said he\nhoped I'd forgive him for not having seen how it had been bothering me,\nand that he never would have had it on the place a day if he'd known.\nThe next time he went to town he bought me a truly little cane rod, a\nreal fishing line, several hooks, and a red bobber too lovely to put\ninto the water.  I thought I was a great person from the fuss all of\nthem made over me, until I noticed Laddie shrug his shoulders, and\nreach back and rub one, and then I remembered.\n\nI went flying, and thank goodness! he held out his arms.\n\n\"Oh Laddie!  I never did it!\" I cried.  \"I never, never did!  I\ncouldn't!  Laddie, I love you best of any one; you know I do!\"\n\n\"Of course you didn't!\" said Laddie.  \"My Little Sister wasn't anywhere\naround when that happened.  That was a poor little girl I never saw\nbefore, and she was in such trouble she didn't know WHAT she was doing.\nAnd I hope I'll never see her again,\" he ended, twisting his shoulder.\nBut he kissed me and made it all right, and really I didn't do that; I\njust simply couldn't have struck Laddie.\n\nMarrying off Sally was little worse than getting Shelley ready for\nschool.  She had to have three suits of everything, and a new dress of\neach kind, and three hats; her trunk wouldn't hold all there was to put\nin it; and father said he never could pay the bills.  He had promised\nher to go, and he didn't know what in this world to do; because he\nnever had borrowed money in his life, and he couldn't begin; for if he\ndied suddenly, that would leave mother in debt, and they might take the\nland from her.  That meant he'd spent what he had in the bank on\nSally's wedding, and all that was in the Underground Station, or maybe\nthe Station money wasn't his.\n\nJust when he was awfully bothered, mother said to never mind, she\nbelieved she could fix it.  She sent all of us into the orchard to pick\nthe fine apples that didn't keep well, and father made three trips to\ntown to sell them.  She had big jars of lard she wouldn't need before\nbutchering time came again, and she sold dried apples, peaches, and\nraspberries from last year.  She got lots of money for barrels of\nfeathers she'd saved to improve her feather beds and pillows; she said\nshe would see to that later.  Father was so tickled to get the money to\nhelp him out that he said he'd get her a pair of those wonderful new\nblue geese like Pryors had, that every one stopped to look at.  When\nthere was not quite enough yet, from somewhere mother brought out money\nthat she'd saved for a long time, from butter and eggs, and chickens,\nand turkeys, and fruit and lard, and things that belonged to her.\nFather hated to use it the worst way, but she said she'd saved it for\nan emergency, and now seemed to be the time.\n\nShe said if the child really had talent, she should be about developing\nit, and while there would be many who would have far finer things than\nShelley, still she meant her to have enough that she wouldn't be the\nworst looking one, and so ashamed she couldn't keep her mind on her\nwork.  Father said, with her face it didn't make any difference what\nshe wore, and mother said that was just like a man; it made all the\ndifference in the world what a girl wore.  Father said maybe it did to\nthe girl, and other women; what he meant was that it made none to a\nman.  Mother said the chief aim and end of a girl's life was not\nwrapped up in a man; and father said maybe not with some girls, but it\nwould be with Shelley: she was too pretty to escape.  I do wonder if\nI'm going to be too pretty to escape, when I put on long dresses.\nSometimes I look in the glass to see if it's coming, but I don't\nsuppose it's any use.  Mother says you can't tell a thing at the\ngrowing age about how a girl is going to look at eighteen.\n\nWhen everything was almost ready, Leon came in one day and said:\n\"Shelley, what about improving your hair?  Have you tried your wild\ngrape sap yet?\"\n\nShelley said:  \"Why, goodness me!  We've been so busy getting Sally\nmarried, and my clothes made, I forgot all about that.  Have you\nnoticed the crock in passing?  Is there anything in it?\"\n\n\"It was about half full, once when I went by,\" said Leon. \"I haven't\nseen it lately.\"\n\n\"Do please be a dear and look, when you go after the cows this\nevening,\" said Shelley.  \"If there's anything in it, bring it up.\"\n\n\n  \"Do it yourself for want of me,\n   The boy replied quite manfully,\"\n\nquoted Leon from \"The Little Lord and the Farmer.\"  He was always\nteasing.\n\n\"I think you're mean as dirt if you don t bring it,\" said Shelley.\n\nLeon grinned and you should have heard the nasty, teasing way he said\nmore of that same piece:\n\n  \"Anger and pride are both unwise,\n   Vinegar never catches flies----\"\n\n\nI wondered she didn't slap him.  You could see she wanted to.  \"I can\nget it myself,\" she said angrily.\n\n\"What will you give me to bring it?\" asked Leon, who never missed a\nchance to make a bargain.\n\n\"My grateful thanks.  Are they not a proper reward?\" asked Shelley.\n\n\"Thanks your foot!\" said Leon.  \"Will you bring something pretty from\nChicago for Susie Fall's Christmas present?\"\n\nEvery one laughed, but Leon never cared.  He liked Susie best of any of\nthe girls, and he wanted every one to know it.  He went straight to her\nwhenever he had a chance, and he'd already told her mother to keep all\nthe other boys away, because he meant to marry her when he grew up, and\nWidow Fall said that was fair enough, and she'd save her for him.  So\nShelley said she would get him something for Susie, and Leon brought\nthe crock.  Shelley looked at it sort of dubious-like, tipped it, and\nstared at the dirt settled in the bottom, and then stuck in her finger\nand tasted it.  She looked at Leon with a queer grin and said: \"Smarty,\nsmarty, think you're smart!\"  She threw the creek water into the swill\nbucket.  No one said a word, but Leon looked much sillier than she did.\nAfter he was gone I asked her if she would bring him a Christmas\npresent for Susie NOW, and she said she ought to bring him a pretty\nglass bottle labelled perfume, with hartshorn in it, and she would, if\nshe thought he'd smell it first.\n\nShelley felt badly about leaving mother when she wasn't very well; but\nmother said it was all right, she had Candace to keep house and May and\nme, and father, and all of us to take care of her, and it would be best\nfor Shelley to go now and work hard as she could, while she had the\nchance.  So one afternoon father took her trunk to the depot and bought\nthe tickets and got the checks, and the next day Laddie drove to\nGroveville with father and Shelley, and she was gone.  Right at the\nlast, she didn't seem to want to leave so badly, but all of them said\nshe must.  Peter's cousin, who had gone last year, was to meet her, and\nhave a room ready where she boarded if she could, and if she couldn't\nright away, then the first one who left, Shelley was to have the place,\nso they'd be together.\n\nThere were eight of us left, counting Candace and Miss Amelia, and you\nwouldn't think a house with eight people living in it would be empty,\nbut ours was.  Everything seemed to wilt.  The roses on the window\nblinds didn't look so bright as they had; mother said the only way she\ncould get along was to keep right on working.  She helped Candace all\nshe could, but she couldn't be on her feet very much, so she sat all\nday long and peeled peaches to dry, showed Candace how to jelly,\npreserve, and spice them, and peeled apples for butter and to dry,\nquantities more than we could use, but she said she always could sell\nsuch things, and with the bunch of us to educate yet, we'd need the\nmoney.\n\nWhen it grew cold enough to shut the doors, and have fire at night,\nfirst thing after supper all of us helped clear the table, then we took\nour slates and books and learned our lessons for the next day, and then\nfather lined us against the wall, all in a row from Laddie down, and he\npronounced words--easy ones that divided into syllables nicely, for me,\nharder for May, and so up until I might sit down.  For Laddie, May and\nLeon he used the geography, the Bible, Roland's history, the Christian\nAdvocate, and the Agriculturist.  My, but he had them so they could\nspell!  After that, as memory tests, all of us recited our reading\nlesson for the next day, especially the poetry pieces.  I knew most of\nthem, from hearing the big folks repeat them so often and practise the\nproper way to read them.  I could do \"Rienzi's Address to the Romans,\"\n\"Casablanca,\" \"Gray's Elegy,\" or \"Mark Antony's Speech,\" but best of\nall, I liked \"Lines to a Water-fowl.\"  When he was tired, if it were\nnot bedtime yet, all of us, boys too, sewed rags for carpet and rugs.\nLaddie braided corn husks for the kitchen and outside door mats, and\nthey were pretty, and \"very useful too,\" like the dog that got his head\npatted in McGuffey's Second.\n\nThen they picked the apples.  These had to be picked by hand, wrapped\nin soft paper, packed in barrels, and shipped to Fort Wayne.  Where\nthey couldn't reach by hand, they stood on barrels or ladders, and used\na long handled picker, so as not to bruise the fruit.  Laddie helped\nwith everything through the day, worked at his books at night, and\nwhenever he stepped outside he looked in the direction of Pryors'.  He\nclimbed to the topmost limbs of the trees with a big basket, picked it\nfull and let it down with a long piece of clothesline.  I loved to be\nin the orchard when they were working; there were plenty of summer\napples to eat yet; it was fun to watch the men, and sometimes I could\nbe useful by handing baskets or heaping up apples to be buried for us.\n\nOne night father read about a man who had been hanged for killing\nanother man, and they cut him down too soon, so he came alive, and they\nhad to hang him over; and father got all worked up about it.  He said\nthe man had suffered death the first time to \"all intents and\npurposes,\" so that fulfilled the requirements of the law, and they were\nwrong when they hanged him again.  Laddie said it was a piece of\nbungling sure enough, but the law said a man must be \"hanged by his\nneck until he was dead,\" and if he weren't dead, why, it was plain he\nhadn't fulfilled the requirements of the law, so they were forced to\nhang him again.  Father said that law was wrong; the man never should\nhave been hanged in the first place.  They talked and argued until we\nwere all excited about it, and the next evening after school Leon and I\nwere helping pick apples, and when father and Laddie went to the barn\nwith a load we sat down to rest and we thought about what they said.\n\n\"Gee, that was tough on the man!\" said Leon, \"but I guess the law is\nall right.  Of course he wouldn't want to die, and twice over at that,\nbut I don't suppose the man he killed liked to die either.  I think if\nyou take a life, it's all right to give your own to pay for it.\"\n\n\"Leon,\" I said, \"some time when you are fighting Absalom Saunders or\nLou Wicks, just awful, if you hit them too hard on some tender spot and\nkill them, would you want to die to pay for it?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want to, but I guess I'd have to,\" said Leon.  \"That's the\nlaw, and it's as good a way to make it as any.  But I'm not going to\nkill any one.  I've studied my physiology hard to find all the spots\nthat will kill.  I never hit them behind the ear, or in the pit of the\nstomach; I just black their eyes, bloody their snoots, and swat them on\nthe chin to finish off with.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose they don't study their physiologies like you do, and hit\nYOU in the wrong place, and kill you, would you want THEM hanged by the\nneck until they were dead, to pay for it?\"\n\n\"I don't think I'd want anything if I were dead,\" he said.  \"I wonder\nhow it feels to die.  Now THAT man knew.  I'd like to be hanged enough\nto find out how it goes, and then come back, and brag about it.  I\ndon't think it hurts much; I believe I'll try it.\"\n\nSo Leon took the rope Laddie lowered the baskets with, and threw it\nover a big limb.  Then he rolled up a barrel and stood on it and put my\nsunbonnet on with the crown over his face, for a black cap, and made\nthe rope into a slip noose over his head, and told me to stand back by\nthe apple tree and hold the rope tight, until he said he was hanged\nenough.  Then he stepped from the barrel.  It jerked me toward him\nabout a yard, as he came down smash! on his feet.  I held with all my\nmight, but he was too heavy--and falling that way.  So he went to\ntrying to fix some other plan, and I told him the sensible thing to do\nwould be for him to hang me, because he'd be strong enough to hold me\nand I could tell him how it felt just as well.  So we fixed me up like\nwe had him, and when Leon got the rope stretched, he wrapped it twice\naround the apple tree so it wouldn't jerk him as it had me, and when he\nsaid \"Ready,\" I stepped from the barrel.  The last thing I heard was\nLeon telling me to say when I was hanged enough.  I was so heavy, the\nrope stretched, and I went down until it almost tore off my head, and I\ncouldn't get a single breath, so of course I didn't tell him, and I\ncouldn't get on the barrel, and my tongue went out, and my chest\nswelled up, and my ears roared, and I kicked and struggled, and all the\ntime I could hear Leon laughing, and shouting to keep it up, that I was\ndying fine; only he didn't know that I really was, and at last I didn't\nfeel or know anything more.\n\nWhen I came to, I was lying on the grass, while father was pumping my\narms, and Laddie was pouring creek water on my face from his hat, and\nLeon was running around in circles, clear crazy.  I heard father tell\nhim he'd give him a scutching he'd remember to the day of his death;\nbut inasmuch as I had told Leon to do it, I had to grab father and hold\nto him tight as I could, until I got breath enough to explain how it\nhappened.  Even then I wasn't sure what he was going to do.\n\nAfter all that, when I tried to tell Leon how it felt, he just cried\nlike a baby, and he wouldn't listen to a word, even when he'd wanted to\nknow so badly.  He said if I hadn't come back, he'd have gone to the\nbarn and used the swing rope on himself, so it was a good thing I did,\nfor one funeral would have cost enough, when we needed money so badly,\nnot to mention how mother would have felt to have two of us go at once,\nlike she had before.  And anyway, it didn't amount to so awful much.\nIt was pretty bad at first, but it didn't last long, and the next day\nmy neck was only a little blue and stiff, and in three days it was all\nover, only a rough place where the rope grained the skin as I went\ndown; but I never got to tell Leon how it felt; I just couldn't talk\nhim into hearing, and it was quite interesting too; but still I easily\nsaw why the man in the paper would object to dying twice, to pay for\nkilling another man once.\n\nWhen the apples were picked and the cabbage, beets, turnips, and\npotatoes were buried, some corn dried in the garret for new meal,\npumpkins put in the cellar, the field corn all husked, and the\nbutchering done, father said the work was in such fine shape, with\nLaddie to help, and there was so much more corn than he needed for us,\nand the price was so high, and the turkeys did so well, and everything,\nthat he could pay back what mother helped him, and have quite a sum\nover.\n\nIt was Thanksgiving by that time, and all of Winfield's, Lucy's, Sally\nand Peter, and our boys came home.  We had a big time, all but Shelley;\nit was too expensive for her to come so far for one day, but mother\nsent her a box with a whole turkey for herself and her friends; and\ncake, popcorn, nuts, and just everything that wasn't too drippy.\nShelley wrote such lovely letters that mother saved them and after we\nhad eaten as much dinner as we could, she read them before we left the\ntable.\n\nI had heard most of them, but I liked to listen again, because they\nsounded so happy.  You could hear Shelley laugh on every page.  She\ntold about how Peter's cousin was waiting when the train stopped.  They\ncouldn't room together right away, but they were going to the first\nchance they had.  Shelley felt badly because they were so far apart,\nbut she was in a nice place, where she could go with other girls of the\nschool until she learned the way.  She told about her room and the\nwoman she boarded with and what she had to eat; she wrote mother not to\nworry about clothes, because most of the others were from the country,\nor small towns, and getting ready to teach, and lots of them didn't\nhave NEARLY as many or as pretty dresses as she did.  She told about\nthe big building, the classes, the professors, and of going to public\nrecitals where some of the pupils who knew enough played; and she was\nworking her fingers almost to the bone, so she could next year.  She\ntold of people she met, and how one of the teachers took a number of\ngirls in his class to see a great picture gallery.  She wrote pages\nabout a young Chicago lawyer she met there, and only a few lines about\nthe pictures, so father said as that was the best collection of art\nwork in Chicago, it was easy enough to see that Shelley had been far\nmore impressed with the man than she had been with the pictures.\nMother said she didn't see how he could say a thing like that about the\nchild.  Of course she couldn't tell in a letter about hundreds of\npictures, but it was easy enough to tell all about a man.\n\nFather got sort of spunky at that, and he said it was mighty little\nthat mattered most, that could be told about a Chicago lawyer; and\nmother had better caution Shelley to think more about her work, and\nwrite less of the man.  Mother said that would stop the child's\nconfidences completely and she'd think all the time about the man, and\nnever mention him again, so she wouldn't know what WAS going on.  She\nsaid she was glad Shelley had found pleasing, refined friends, and\nshe'd encourage her all she could in cultivating them; but of course\nshe'd caution her to be careful, and she'd tell her what the danger\nwas, and after that Shelley wrote and wrote.  Mother didn't always read\nthe letters to us, but she answered every one she got that same night.\nSometimes she pushed the pen so she jabbed the paper, and often she\nsmiled or laughed softly.\n\nI liked Thanksgiving.  We always had a house full of company, and they\ndidn't stay until we were tired of them, as they did at Christmas, and\nthere was as much to eat; the only difference was that there were no\npresents.  It wasn't nearly so much work to fix for one day as it was\nfor a week; so it wasn't so hard on mother and Candace, and father\ndidn't have to spend much money.  We were wearing all our clothes from\nlast fall that we could, and our coats from last winter to help out,\nbut we didn't care.  We had a lot of fun, and we wanted Sally and\nShelley to have fine dresses, because they were in big cities where\nthey needed them, and in due season, no doubt, we would have much more\nthan they, because, as May figured it, there would be only a few of us\nby that time, so we could have more to spend.  That looked sensible,\nand I thought it would be that way, too.  We were talking it over\ncoming from school one evening, and when we had settled it, we began to\nplay \"Dip and Fade.\"  That was a game we made up from being at church,\nand fall and spring were the only times we could play it, because then\nthe rains filled all the ditches beside the road where the dirt was\nplowed up to make the bed higher, and we had to have the water to dip\nin and fade over.\n\nWe played it like that, because it was as near as we could come to\nworking out a song Isaac Thomas sang every time he got happy.  He had a\nlot of children at home, and more who had died, from being half-fed and\nfrozen, mother thought; and he was always talking about meeting the\n\"pore innocents\" in Heaven, and singing that one song.  Every time he\nmade exactly the same speech in meeting.  It began like reciting\npoetry, only it didn't rhyme, but it sort of cut off in lines, and\nIsaac waved back and forth on his feet, and half sung it, and the rags\nwaved too, but you just couldn't feel any thrills of earnestness about\nwhat he said, because he needed washing, and to go to work and get him\nsome clothes and food to fill out his frame.  He only looked funny, and\nmade you want to laugh.  It took Emanuel Ripley to raise your hair.  I\ndon't know why men like my father, and the minister, and John Dover\nstood it; they talked over asking Isaac to keep quiet numbers of times,\nbut the minister said there were people like that in every church, they\nalways came among the Lord's anointed, and it was better to pluck out\nyour right eye than to offend one of them, and he was doubtful about\ndoing it.  So we children all knew that the grown people scarcely could\nstand Isaac's speech, and prayer, and song, and that they were afraid\nto tell him plain out that he did more harm than good.  Every meeting\nabout the third man up was Isaac, and we had to watch him wave, and\nrant, and go sing-songy:\n\n  \"Oh brethering and sistering--ah,\n  It delights my heart--ah to gather with you,\n  In this holy house of worship--ah.\n  In his sacred word--ah,\n  The Lord--ah tells us,\n  That we are all his childring--ah.\n  And now, lemme exhort you to-night--ah,\n  As one that loves you--ah,\n  To choose that good part, that Mary chose--ah,\n  That the worrrr-uld kin neither give ner take away--ah.\"\n\nThat went on until he was hoarse, then he prayed, and arose and sang\nhis song.  Other men spoke where they stood.  Isaac always walked to\nthe altar, faced the people, and he was tired out when he finished, but\nso proud of himself, so happy, and he felt so sure that his efforts\nwere worth a warm bed, sausage, pancakes, maple syrup, and coffee for\nbreakfast, that it was mighty seldom he failed to fool some one else\ninto thinking so too, and if he could, he wouldn't have to walk four\nmiles home on cold nights, with no overcoat.  In summer, mostly, they\nlet him go.  Isaac always was fattest in winter, especially during\nrevivals, but at any time mother said he looked like a sheep's carcass\nafter the buzzards had picked it.  It could be seen that he was\nperfectly strong, and could have fed and clothed himself, and Mandy and\nthe children, quite as well as our father did us, if he had wanted to\nwork, for we had the biggest family of the neighbourhood.  So we\nchildren made fun of him and we had to hold our mouths shut when he got\nup all tired and teary-like, and began to quaver:\n\n    \"Many dear childurn we know dew stan'\n    Un toon ther harps in the better lan',\n    Ther little hans frum each soundin' string,\n    Bring music sweet, wile the Anguls sing,\n    Bring music sweet, wile the Anguls sing,--\n\n      We shell meet them agin on that shore,\n      We shell meet them agin on that shore,\n      With fairer face, un angel grace,\n      Each loved un ull welcome us ther.\n\n    \"They uster mourn when the childurn died,\n    Un said goo-bye at the river side,\n    They dipped ther feet in the glidin' stream,\n    Un faded away, like a loveli dream,\n    Un faded away like a loveli dream.\"\n\n\nThen the chorus again, and then Isaac dropped on the front seat\nexhausted, and stayed there until some good-hearted woman, mostly my\nmother, felt so sorry about his shiftlessness she asked him to go home\nwith us and warmed and fed him, and put him in the traveller's bed to\nsleep.  The way we played it was this: we stood together at the edge of\na roadside puddle and sang the first verse and the chorus exactly as\nIsaac did.  Then I sang the second verse, and May was one of the \"many\ndear childurn,\" and as I came to the lines she dipped her feet in the\n\"glidin' stream,\" and for \"fading away,\" she jumped across.\n\nNow May was a careful little soul, and always watched what she was\ndoing, so she walked up a short way, chose a good place, and when I\nsang the line, she was almost birdlike, she dipped and faded so\ngracefully.  Then we laughed like dunces, and then May began to sway\nand swing, and drone through her nose for me, and I was so excited I\nnever looked.  I just dipped and faded on the spot.  I faded all right\ntoo, for I couldn't jump nearly across, and when I landed in pure clay\nthat had been covered with water for three weeks, I went down to my\nknees in mud, to my waist in water, and lost my balance and fell\nbackward.\n\nA man passing on horseback pried me out with a rail and helped me home.\nOf course he didn't know how I happened to fall in, and I was too\nchilled to talk.  I noticed May only said I fell, so I went to bed\nscorched inside with red pepper tea, and never told a word about\ndipping and fading.  Leon whispered and said he bet it was the last\ntime I would play that, so as soon as my coat and dress were washed and\ndried, and I could go back to school, I did it again, just to show him\nI was no cowardy-calf; but I had learned from May to choose a puddle I\ncould manage before I faded.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\"Even So\"\n\n  \"All things whatsoever ye would\n  That men should do to you,\n  Do ye even so to them.\"\n\n\nOur big girls and boys always made a dreadful fuss and said we would\ncatch every disease you could mention, but mother and father were set\nabout it, just like the big rocks in the hills.  They said they,\nthemselves, once had been at the mercy of the people, and they knew how\nit felt.  Mother said when they were coming here in a wagon, and she\nhad ridden until she had to walk to rest her feet, and held a big baby\nuntil her arms became so tired she drove while father took it, and when\nat last they saw a house and stopped, she said if the woman hadn't\ninvited her in, and let her cook on the stove, given her milk and eggs,\nand furnished her a bed to sleep in once in a while, she couldn't have\nreached here at all; and she never had been refused once.  Then she\nalways quoted:  \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to\nyou, do ye EVEN SO to them.\"\n\nFather said there were men who made a business of splitting hairs, and\nof finding different meanings in almost everything in the Bible.  I\nwould like to have seen any one split hairs about that, or it made to\nmean something else.  Of all the things in the Bible that you had to do\nbecause it said to, whether you liked it or not, that was the one you\nstruck oftenest in life and it took the hardest pull to obey.  It was\njust the hatefulest text of any, and made you squirm most.  There was\nno possible way to get around it.  It meant, that if you liked a\nsplinter new slate, and a sharp pencil all covered with gold paper, to\nmake pictures and write your lessons, when Clarissa Polk sat next you\nand sang so low the teacher couldn't hear until she put herself to\nsleep on it, \"I WISHT I had a slate!  I wisht I HAD a slate!  I wisht I\nhad a SLATE!  Oh I WISHT I HAD A SLATE!\"--it meant that you just had to\nwash up yours and stop making pictures yourself, and pass it over; you\neven had to smile when you offered it, if you did it right.  I seldom\ngot through it as the Lord would, for any one who loaned Clarissa a\nslate knew that it would come back with greasy, sweaty finger marks on\nit you almost had to dig a hole to wash off, and your pencil would be\nwet.  And if there were the least flaw of crystal in the pencil, she\nfound it, and bore down so hard that what she wrote never would come\noff.\n\nThe Lord always seemed bigger and more majestic to me, than at any\nother time, when I remembered that He could have known all that, and\nyet smiled as He loaned Clarissa His slate.  And that old Bible thing\nmeant, too, that if you would like it if you were travelling a long\nway, say to California to hunt gold, or even just to Indiana, to find a\nfarm fit to live on--it meant that if you were tired, hungry, and sore,\nand would want to be taken in and fed and rested, you had to let in\nother people when they reached your house.  Father and mother had been\nthrough it themselves, and they must have been tired as could be,\nbefore they reached Sarah Hood's and she took them in, and rested and\nfed them, even when they were only a short way from the top of the\nLittle Hill, where next morning they looked down and stopped the wagon,\nuntil they chose the place to build their house.  Sarah Hood came\nalong, and helped mother all day, so by night she was settled in the\nold cabin that was on the land, and ready to go to work making money to\nbuild a new one, and then a big house, and fix the farm all beautiful\nlike it was then.  They knew so well how it felt, that they kept one\nbed in the boys' room, and any man who came at dusk got his supper, to\nsleep there, and his breakfast, and there never was anything to pay.\nThe girls always scolded dreadfully about the extra washing, but mother\nsaid she slept on sheets when she came out, and some one washed them.\n\nOne time Sally said:  \"Mother, have you ever figured out how many\nhundred sheets you've washed since, to pay for that?\"\n\nMother said:  \"No, but I just hope it will make a stack high enough for\nme to climb from into Heaven.\"\n\nSally said:  \"The talk at the church always led me to think that you\nflew to Heaven.\"\n\nMother answered:  \"So I get there, I don't mind if I creep.\"\n\nThen Sally knew it was time to stop.  We always knew.  And we stopped,\ntoo!\n\nWe had heard that \"All things\" quotation, until the first two words\nwere as much as mother ever needed repeat of it any more, and we had\ncooked, washed for, and waited on people travelling, until Leon got so\nwhen he saw any one coming--of course we knew all the neighbours, and\ntheir horses and wagons and carriages--he always said:  \"Here comes\nanother 'Even So!'\"  He said we had done \"even so\" to people until it\nwas about our share, but mother said our share was going to last until\nthe Lord said, \"Well done, good and faithful servant,\" and took us\nhome.  She had much more about the stranger at the gate and\nentertaining angels unawares; why, she knew every single thing in the\nBible that meant it was her duty to feed and give a bed to any one, no\nmatter how dirty or miserable looking he was!  So when Leon came in one\nevening at dusk and said, \"There's another 'Even So' coming down the\nLittle Hill!\" all of us knew that we'd have company for the night, and\nwe had.\n\nI didn't like that man, but some of the others seemed to find him\namusing.  Maybe it was because I had nothing to do but sit and watch\nhim, and so I saw more of him than the ones who came and went all the\ntime.  As long as there was any one in the room, he complained\ndreadfully about his sore foot, and then cheered up and talked, and he\ncould tell interesting things.  He was young, but he must have been\nmost everywhere and seen everything.  He was very brave and could stand\noff three men who were going to take from him the money he was carrying\nto buy a piece of land in Illinois.  The minute the grown folks left\nthe room to milk, do the night feeding, and begin supper, he twisted in\nhis chair and looked at every door, and went and stood at the back\ndining-room window, where he could see the barn and what was out there,\nand coming back he took a peep into father's and mother's room, and\nalthough he limped dreadfully when he came, he walked like any one when\nhe went over and picked up father's gun and looked to see if it were\nloaded, and seemed mighty glad when he found it wasn't.  Father said he\ncould load in a flash when it was necessary, but he was dubious about a\nloaded gun in a house full of children.  Not one of us ever touched it,\nuntil the boys were big enough to have permission, like Laddie and Leon\nhad.  He said a gun was such a great \"moral persuader,\" that the sight\nof one was mostly all that was needed, and nobody could tell by looking\nat it whether it was loaded or not.  This man could, for he examined\nthe lock and smiled in a pleased way over it, and he never limped a\nstep going back to his chair.  He kept on complaining, until father\ntold him before bedtime that he had better rest a day or two, and\nmother said that would be a good idea.\n\nHe talked so much we couldn't do our lessons or spell very well, but it\nwas Friday and we'd have another chance Saturday, so it didn't make so\nmuch difference.  Father said the traveller must be tired and sleepy\nand Leon should take a light and show him to bed.  He stayed so long\nfather went to the foot of the stairway, and asked him why he didn't\ncome down and he said he was in bed too.  The next morning he was\nsleepy at breakfast and Laddie said it was no wonder, because Leon and\nthe traveller were talking when he went upstairs.  The man turned to\nfather and said: \"That's a mighty smart boy, Mr. Stanton.\"  Father\nfrowned and said:  \"Praise to the face is open disgrace.  I hope he\nwill be smart enough not to disgrace us, anyway.\"\n\nThe traveller said he was sure he would be, and we could see that he\nhad taken a liking to Leon, for he went with him to the barn to help do\nthe morning feeding.  They stayed so long mother sent me to call them,\nand when I got there, the man was telling Leon how foolish it was for\nboys to live on a farm; how they never would amount to anything unless\nthey went to cities, and about all the fun there was there, and how\nnice it was to travel, even along the roads, because every one fed you,\nand gave you a good bed.  He forgot that walking had made his foot\nlame, and I couldn't see, to save me, why he was going to spend his\nmoney to buy a farm, if he thought a town the only place where it was\nfit to live.\n\nHe stayed all Saturday, and father said Sunday was no suitable time to\nstart on a journey again, and the man's foot was bad when father was\naround, so it would be better to wait until Monday.  The traveller\ntagged Leon and told him what a fine fellow he was, how smart he was,\nand to prove it, Leon boasted about everything he knew, and showed the\nman all over the farm.\n\nI even saw them pass the Station in the orchard, and heard Leon brag\nhow father had been an agent for the Governor; but of course he didn't\nreally show him the place, and probably it would have made no\ndifference if he had, for all the money must have been spent on Sally's\nwedding.  Of course father might have put some there he had got since,\nor that money might never have been his at all, but it seemed as if it\nwould be, because it was on his land.\n\nSunday evening all of us attended church, but the traveller was too\ntired, so when Leon said he'd stay with him, father thought it was all\nright.  I could see no one wanted to leave the man alone in the house.\nHe said they'd go to bed early, and we came in quite late.  The lamp\nwas turned low, the door unlocked, and everything in place.  Laddie\nwent to bed without a candle, and said he'd undress and slip in easy so\nas not to waken them.\n\nIn the morning when he got up the traveller's bed hadn't been slept in,\nand neither had Leon's.  The gun was gone, and father stared at mother,\nand mother stared at Laddie, and he turned and ran straight toward the\nStation, and in a minute he was back, whiter than a plate.  He just\nsaid:  \"All gone!\"  Father and mother both sat down suddenly and hard.\nThen Laddie ran to the barn and came back and said none of the horses\nhad been taken.  Soon they went into the parlour and shut the door, and\nwhen they came out father staggered and mother looked exactly like\nSabethany.  Laddie ran to the barn, saddled Flos and rode away.  Father\nwanted to ring an alarm on the dinner bell, like he had a call arranged\nto get all the neighbours there quickly if we had sickness or trouble,\nand mother said:  \"Paul, you shall not!  He's so young!  We've got to\nkeep this as long as we can, and maybe the Lord will help us find him,\nand we can give him another chance.\"\n\nFather started to say something, and mother held up her hand and just\nsaid, \"Paul!\" and he sank back in the chair and kept still.  Mother\nalways had spoken of him as \"the Head of the Family,\" and here he\nwasn't at all!  He minded her quickly as I would.\n\nWhen Miss Amelia came downstairs they let her start to school and never\ntold her a word, but mother said May and I were not to go.  So I\nslipped out and ran through the orchard to look at the Station, and\nsure enough! the stone was rolled back, the door open and the can lying\non the floor.  I slid down and picked it up, and there was one sheet of\npaper money left in it stuck to the sides.  It was all plain as a\npikestaff.  Leon must have thought the money had been spent, and showed\nthe traveller the Station, just to brag, and he guessed there might be\nsomething there, and had gone while we were at church and taken it.  He\nhad all night the start of us, and he might have a horse waiting\nsomewhere, and be almost to Illinois by this time, and if the money\nbelonged to father, there would be no Christmas; and if it happened to\nbe the money the county gave him to pay the men who worked the roads\nevery fall, and Miss Amelia, or collections from the church, he'd have\nto pay it back, even if it put him in debt; and if he died, they might\ntake the land, like he said; and where on earth was Leon?  Knew what\nhe'd done and hiding, I bet!  He needed the thrashing he would get that\ntime, and I started out to hunt him and have it over with, so mother\nwouldn't be uneasy about him yet; and then I remembered Laddie had said\nLeon hadn't been in bed all night.  He was gone too!\n\nMaybe he wanted to try life in a city, where the traveller had said\neverything was so grand; but he must have known that he'd kill his\nmother if he went, and while he didn't kiss her so often, and talk so\nmuch as some of us, I never could see that he didn't run quite as fast\nto get her a chair or save her a step.  He was so slim and light he\ncould race for the doctor faster than Laddie or father, either one.  Of\ncourse he loved his mother, just as all of us did; he never, never\ncould go away and not let her know about it.  If he had gone, that\nwatchful-eyed man, who was lame only part of the time, had taken the\ngun and made him go.  I thought I might as well save the money he'd\noverlooked, so I gripped it tight in my hand, and put it in my apron\npocket, the same as I had Laddie's note to the Princess, and started to\nthe barn, on the chance that Leon might be hiding.  I knew precious\nwell I would, if I were in his place.  So I hunted the granaries, the\nhaymow, the stalls, then I stood on the threshing floor and cried:\n\"Leon!  If you're hiding come quick!  Mother will be sick with worrying\nand father will be so glad to see you, he won't do anything much.  Do\nplease hurry!\"\n\nThen I listened, and all I could hear was a rat gnawing at a corner of\nthe granary under the hay.  Might as well have saved its teeth, it\nwould strike a strip of tin when it got through, but of course it\ncouldn't know that.  Then I went to every hole around the haystack,\nwhere the cattle had eaten; none were deep yet, like they would be\nlater in the season, and all the way I begged of Leon to come out.\nOnce a rooster screamed, flew in my face and scared me good, but no\nLeon; so I tried the corn crib, the implement shed, and the wood house,\nclimbing the ladder with the money still gripped in one hand.  Then I\nslipped in the front door, up the stairs, and searched the garret, even\naway back where I didn't like to very well.  At last I went to the\ndining-room, and I don't think either father or mother had moved, while\nSabethany turned to stone looked good compared with them.  Seemed as if\nit would have been better if they'd cried, or scolded, or anything but\njust sit there as they did, when you could see by their moving once in\na while that they were alive.  In the kitchen Candace and May finished\nthe morning work, and both of them cried steadily.  I slipped to May,\n\"Whose money was it?\" I whispered.  \"Father's, or the county's, or the\nchurch's?\"\n\n\"All three,\" said May.\n\n\"The traveller took it.\"\n\n\"How would he find it?  None of us knew there was such a place before.\"\n\n\"Laddie seemed to know!\"\n\n\"Oh Laddie!  Father trusts him about everything.\"\n\n\"They don't think HE told?\"\n\n\"Of course not, silly.  It's Leon who is gone!\"\n\n\"Leon may have told about the Station!\" I cried.  \"He didn't touch the\nmoney.  He never touched it!\"\n\nThen I went straight to father.  Keeping a secret was one thing; seeing\nthe only father you had look like that, was another.  I held out the\nmoney.\n\n\"There's one piece old Even So didn't get, anyway,\" I said.  \"Found it\non the floor of the Station, where it was stuck to the can.  And I\nthought Leon must be hiding for fear he'd be whipped for telling, but\nI've hunted where we usually hide, and promised him everything under\nthe sun if he'd come out; but he didn't, so I guess that traveller man\nmust have used the gun to make him go along.\"\n\nFather sat and stared at me.  He never offered to touch the money, not\neven when I held it against his hand.  So I saw that money wasn't the\ntrouble, else he'd have looked quick enough to see how much I had.\nThey were thinking about Leon being gone, at least father was.  Mother\ncalled me to her and asked:  \"You knew about the Station?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"On the way back from taking Amanda Deam her ducks this summer.\"\n\n\"Leon was with you?\"\n\n\"He found it.\"\n\n\"What were you doing?\"\n\n\"Sitting on the fence eating apples.  We were wondering why that ravine\nplace wasn't cleaned up, when everywhere else was, and then Leon said\nthere might be a reason.  He told about having seen a black man, and\nthat he was hidden some place, and we hunted there and found it.  We\nrolled back the stone, and opened the door, and Leon went in, and both\nof us saw a can full of money.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"We didn't touch it, mother!  Truly we didn't!  Leon said we'd found\nsomething not intended for children, and we'd be whipped sick if we\never went near or told, and we never did, not even once, unless Leon\nwanted to boast to the traveller man, but if he showed him the place,\nhe thought sure the money had all been spent on the wedding and sending\nShelley away.\"\n\nFather's arms shot out, and his head pitched on the table.  Mother got\nup and began to walk the floor, and never went near or even touched\nhim.  I couldn't bear it.  I went and pulled his arm and put the bill\nunder his hand.\n\n\"Leon didn't take your money!  He didn't!  He didn't!  I just know he\ndidn't!  He does tricks because they are so funny, or he thinks they'll\nbe, but he doesn't steal!  He doesn't touch a single thing that is not\nhis, only melons, or chicken out of the skillet, or bread from the\ncellar; but not money and things.  I take gizzards and bread myself,\nbut I don't steal, and Leon or none of us do!  Oh father, we don't!\nNot one of us do!  Don't you remember about 'Thou shalt not,' and the\nCrusaders?  Leon's the best fighter of any of us.  I'm not sure that he\ncouldn't even whip Laddie, if he got mad enough!  Maybe he can't whip\nthe traveller if he has the gun, but, father, Leon simply couldn't take\nthe money.  Laddie will stay home and work, and all of us.  We can help\nget it back.  We can sell a lot of things.  Laddie will sell Flos\nbefore he'll see you suffer so; and all of us will give up Christmas,\nand we'll work!  We'll work as hard as ever we can, and maybe you could\nspare the little piece Joe Risdell wants to build his cabin on.  We can\nmanage about the money, father, indeed we can.  But you don't dare\nthink Leon took it!  He never did!  Why, he's yours!  Yours and\nmother's!\"\n\nFather lifted his head and reached out his arms.\n\n\"You blessing!\" he said.  \"You blessing from the Lord!\"\n\nThen he gave me a cold, stiff kiss on the forehead, went to mother,\ntook her arm, and said:  \"Come, mommy, let's go and tell the Lord about\nit, and then we'll try to make some plan.  Perhaps Laddie will be back\nwith word soon.\"\n\nBut he almost had to carry her.  Then we could hear him praying, and he\nwas so anxious, and he made it so earnest it sounded exactly like the\nLord was in our room and father was talking right to His face.  I tried\nto think, and this is what I thought: as father left the room, he\nlooked exactly as I had seen Mr. Pryor more than once, and my mother\nhad both hands gripped over her heart, and she said we must not let any\none know.  Now if something could happen to us to make my father look\nlike the Princess' and my mother hold her heart with both hands, and if\nno one were to know about it like they had said, how were we any\ndifferent from Pryors?  We might be of the Lord's anointed, but we\ncould get into the same kind of trouble the infidels could, and have\nsecrets ourselves, or at least it seemed as if it might be very nearly\nthe same, when it made father and mother look and act the way they did.\nI wondered if we'd have to leave our lovely, lovely home, cross a sea\nand be strangers in a strange land, as Laddie said; and if people would\ntalk about us, and make us feel that being a stranger was the\nloneliest, hardest thing in all the world.  Well, if mysteries are like\nthis, and we have to live with one days and years, the Lord have mercy\non us!  Then I saw the money lying on the table, so I took it and put\nit in the Bible.  Then I went out and climbed the catalpa tree to watch\nfor Laddie.\n\nSoon I saw a funny thing, such as I never before had seen.  Coming\nacross the fields, straight toward our house, sailing over the fences\nlike a bird, came the Princess on one of her horses.  Its legs\nstretched out so far its body almost touched the ground, and it lifted\nup and swept over the rails.  She took our meadow fence lengthwiselike,\nand at the hitching rack she threw the bridle over the post,\ndismounted, and then I saw she had been riding astride, like a man.  I\nran before her and opened the sitting-room door, but no one was there,\nso I went on to the dining-room.  Father had come in, and mother was\nsitting in her chair.  Both of them looked at the Princess and never\nsaid a word.\n\nShe stopped inside the dining-room door and spoke breathlessly, as if\nshe as well as the horse had raced.\n\n\"I hope I'm not intruding,\" she said, \"but a man north of us told our\nThomas in the village that robbers had taken quite a large sum of\nhidden money you held for the county, and church, and of your own, and\nyour gun, and got away while you were at church last night.  Is it\ntrue?\"\n\n\"Practically,\" said my father.\n\nThen my mother motioned toward a chair.\n\n\"You are kind to come,\" she said.  \"Won't you be seated?\"\n\nThe Princess stepped to the chair, but she gripped the back in both\nhands and stood straight, breathing fast, her eyes shining with\nexcitement, her lips and cheeks red, so lovely you just had to look,\nand look.\n\n\"No,\" she said.  \"I'll tell you why I came, and then if there is\nnothing I can do here, and no errand I can ride for you, I'll go.\nMother has heart trouble, the worst in all the world, the kind no\ndoctor can ever hope to cure, and sometimes, mostly at night, she is\ndriven to have outside air.  Last night she was unusually ill, and I\nheard her leave the house, after I'd gone to my room.  I watched from\nmy window and saw her take a seat on a bench under the nearest tree.  I\nwas moving around and often I looked to see if she were still there.\nThen the dogs began to rave, and I hurried down.  They used to run\nfree, but lately, on account of her going out, father has been forced\nto tie them at night.  They were straining at their chains, and barking\ndreadfully.  I met her at the door, but she would only say some one\npassed and gave her a fright.  When Thomas came in and told what he had\nheard, she said instantly that she had seen the man.\n\n\"She said he was about the size of Thomas, that he came from your\ndirection, that he ran when our dogs barked, but he kept beside the\nfences, and climbed over where there were trees.  He crossed our\nbarnyard and went toward the northwest.  Mother saw him distinctly as\nhe reached the road, and she said he was not a large man, he stooped\nwhen he ran, and she thought he moved like a slinking, city thief.  She\nis sure he's the man who took your money; she says he acted exactly as\nif he were trying to escape pursuit; but I was to be SURE to tell you\nthat he didn't carry a gun.  If your gun is gone, there must have been\ntwo, and the other man took that and went a different way.  Did two men\nstop here?\"\n\n\"No,\" said father.  \"Only one.\"\n\nThe Princess looked at him thoughtfully.\n\n\"Do you think, Mr. Stanton,\" she said, \"that the man who took the money\nwould burden himself with a gun?  Isn't a rifle heavy for one in flight\nto carry?\"\n\n\"It is,\" said father.  \"Your mother saw nothing of two men?\"\n\n\"Only one, and she knows he didn't carry a gun.  Except the man you\ntook in, no stranger has been noticed around here lately?\"\n\n\"No one.  We are quite careful.  Even the gun was not loaded as it\nstood; whoever took it carried the ammunition also, but he couldn't\nfire until he loaded.\"\n\nFather turned to the corner where the gun always stood and then he\nstooped and picked up two little white squares from the floor.\n\nThey were bits of unbleached muslin in which he wrapped the bullets he\nmade.\n\n\"The rifle was loaded before starting, and in a hurry,\" he said, as he\nheld up the squares of muslin.  Then he scratched a match, bent, and\nran it back and forth over the floor, and at one place there was a\nflash, and the flame went around in funny little fizzes as it caught a\ngrain of powder here and there.  \"You see the measure was overrun.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't the man naturally think the gun was loaded, and take it as it\nstood?\"\n\n\"That would be a reasonable conclusion,\" said father.\n\n\"But he looked!\" I cried.  \"That first night when you and the boys went\nto the barn, and the girls were getting supper, he looked at the gun,\nand he LIKED it when he saw it wasn't loaded.  He smiled.  And he\ndidn't limp a mite when I was the only one in the room.  He and Leon\nknew it wasn't loaded, and I guess he didn't load it, for he liked\nhaving it empty so well.\"\n\n\"Ummmm!\" said father.  \"What it would save in this world if a child\nonly knew when to talk and when to keep still.  Little Sister, the next\ntime you see a stranger examine my gun when I'm not in the room,\nsuppose you take father out alone and whisper to him about it.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n\nThe way I wished I had told that at the right time made me dizzy, but\nthen there were several good switchings I'd had for telling things,\nbesides what Sally did to me about her and Peter.  I would have enjoyed\nknowing how one could be sure.  Hereafter, it will be all right about\nthe gun, anyway.\n\n\"Could I take my horse and carry a message anywhere for you?  Are both\nyour sons riding to tell the neighbours?\"\n\nFather hesitated, but it seemed as if he stopped to think, so I just\ntold her:  \"Laddie is riding.  Leon didn't take a horse.\"\n\nFather said there was nothing she could do, so she took my hand and we\nstarted for the gate.\n\n\"I do hope they will find him, and get back the money, and give him\nwhat he deserves!\" she cried.\n\n\"Yes, father and mother are praying that they'll find him,\" I said.\n\"It doesn't seem to make the least difference to them about the money.\nFather didn't even look at a big paper piece I found where it was\nhidden.  But they are anxious about the man.  Mother says he is so\nyoung, we just must find him, and keep this a secret, and give him\nanother chance.  You won't tell, will you?\"\n\nThe Princess stood still on our walk, and then of all things!  if she\ndidn't begin to go Sabethany-like.  The colour left her cheeks and lips\nand she shivered and shook and never said one word.  I caught her arm.\n\"Say, what ails you?\" I cried.  \"You haven't gone and got heart trouble\ntoo, have you?\"\n\nShe stood there trembling, and then, wheeling suddenly, ran back into\nthe house, and went to my mother.  On her knees, the Princess buried\nher face in mother's breast and said:  \"Oh Mrs. Stanton!  Oh, if I only\ncould help you!\"\n\nShe began to cry as if something inside her had broken, and she'd shake\nto pieces.\n\nMother stared above her head at father, with her eyebrows raised high,\nand he waved his hand toward me.  Mother turned to me, but already she\nhad put her arms around the Princess, and was trying to hold her\ntogether.\n\n\"What did you tell her that made her come back?\" she asked sternlike.\n\n\"You forgot to explain that the man was so young, and you wanted to\nkeep it a secret and give him another chance,\" I said.  \"I just asked\nher not to tell.\"\n\nMother looked at father and all the colour went from her face, and she\nbegan to shake.  He stared at her, then he opened her door and lifted\nthe Princess with one arm, and mother with the other, and helped them\ninto mother's room, stepped back and closed the door.  After a while it\nopened and they came out together, with both mother's arms around the\nPrincess, and she had cried until she staggered.  Mother lifted her\nface and kissed her, when they reached the door and said:  \"Tell your\nmother I understand enough to sympathize.  Carry her my love.  I do\nwish she would give herself the comfort of asking God to help her.\"\n\n\"She does!  Oh, I'm sure she does!\" said the Princess.  \"It's father\nwho has lost all judgment and reason.\"\n\nFather went with her to the gate, and this time she needed help to\nmount her horse, and she left it to choose its way and go where it\npleased on the road.  When father came in he looked at mother, and she\nsaid:  \"I haven't the details, but she understands too well.  The Pryor\nmystery isn't much of a mystery any more.  God help their poor souls,\nand save us from suffering like that!\"\n\nShe said so little and meant so much, I couldn't figure out exactly\nwhat she did mean, but father seemed to understand.\n\n\"I've often wondered,\" he said, but he didn't say what he wondered, and\nhe hurried to the barn and saddled our best horse and came in and began\ngetting ready to ride, and we knew he would go northwest.  I went back\nto the catalpa tree and wondered myself; but it was too much for me to\nstraighten out: just why my mother wanting to give the traveller man\nanother chance would make the Princess feel like that.  If she had\nknown my mother as I did, she'd have known that she ALWAYS wanted to\ngive every man a second chance, no matter whether he was young or old.\n\nThen I saw Laddie coming down the Big Hill beside the church, but he\nwas riding so fast I thought he wouldn't want to bother with me, so I\nslid from the tree, and ran to tell mother.  She went to the door and\nwatched as he rode up, but you could see by his face he had not heard\nof them.\n\n\"Nothing, but I have some men out.  I am going east now,\" he said.  \"I\nwish, father, you would rub Flos down, blanket her, and if you can,\nwalk her slowly an hour while she cools off.  I am afraid I've ruined\nher.  How much had you there?\"\n\n\"I haven't stopped to figure,\" said father.  \"I think I'd better take\nthe horse I have ready and go on one of the northwest roads.  The Pryor\ngirl was here a few moments ago, and her mother saw a man cross their\nplace about the right time last evening.  He ran and acted suspiciously\nwhen the dogs barked.  But he was alone and he didn't have a gun.\"\n\n\"Was she sure?\"\n\n\"Positive.\"\n\n\"Then it couldn't have been our man, but I'll ride in that direction\nand start a search.  They would keep to the woods, I think!  You'd\nbetter stay with mother.  I'll ask Jacob Hood to take your place.\"\n\nSo Laddie rode away again without even going into the house, and mother\nsaid to father:  \"What can he be saying to people, that the neighbours\ndon't come?\"\n\nFather answered:  \"I don't know, but if any one can save the situation,\nLaddie will.\"\n\nMother went to bed, while father sat beside her reading aloud little\nscraps from the Bible, and they took turns praying.  From the way they\ntalked to the Lord, you could plainly see that they were reminding Him\nof all the promises He had made to take care of people, comfort those\nin trouble, and heal the broken-hearted.\n\nOne thing was so curious, I asked May if she noticed, and she had.\nWhen they had made such a fuss about money only a short while before,\nand worked so hard to get our share together, and when they would have\nto pay back all that belonged to the county and church, neither of them\never even mentioned money then.  Every minute I expected father to ask\nwhere I'd put the piece I found, and when he opened right at it, in the\nBible, he turned on past, exactly as if it were an obituary, or a piece\nof Sally's wedding dress, or baby hair from some of our heads.  He went\non hunting places where the Lord said sure and strong that He'd help\npeople who loved Him.  When either of them prayed, they asked the Lord\nto help those near them who were in trouble, as often and earnestly as\nthey begged Him to help them.  There were no people near us who were in\ntrouble that we knew of, excepting Pryors.  Hard as father and mother\nworked, you'd have thought the Lord wouldn't have minded if they asked\nonly once to get the money back, or if they forgot the neighbours, but\nthey did neither one.\n\nMay said because they were big like that was why all of us loved them\nso.\n\nI would almost freeze in the catalpa, but as I could see far in all\ndirections there, I went back, and watched the roads, and when I\nremembered what Laddie had said, I kept an eye on the fields too.  At\nalmost dusk, and frozen so stiff I could scarcely hang to the limb, I\nheard the bulldogs at Pryors' begin to rave.  They kept on steadily,\nand I thought Gypsies must be passing.  Then from the woods came a\nqueer party that started across the cornfield toward the Big Meadow in\nfront of the house, and I thought they were hunters.  I stood in the\ntree and watched until they climbed the meadow fence, and by that time\nI could see plainly.\n\nThe traveller man got over first, then Leon and the dogs, and then Mr.\nPryor handed Leon the gun, leaped over, and took it.  I looked again,\nand then fell from the tree and almost bursted.  As soon as I could get\nup, and breathe, I ran to the front door, screaming:  \"Father!  Father!\nCome open the Big Gate.  Leon's got him, but he's so tired Mr. Pryor is\ncarrying the gun, and helping him walk!\"\n\nJust like one, all of us ran; father crossed the road, and opened the\ngate.  The traveller man wouldn't look up, he just slouched along.  But\nLeon's chin was up and his head high.  He was scratched, torn, and\ndirty.  He was wheezing every breath most from his knees, and Mr. Pryor\nhalf carried him and the gun.  When they met us, Leon reached in his\ntrousers pocket and drew out a big roll of money that he held toward\nfather.  \"My fault!\" he gasped.  \"But I got it back for you.\"\n\nThen he fell over and father caught him in his arms and carried him\ninto the house, and laid him on the couch in the dining-room.\n\nMr. Pryor got down and gathered up the money from the road.  He\nfollowed into the house and set the gun in the corner.\n\n\"Don't be frightened,\" he said to mother.  \"The boy has walked all\nnight, and all day, with no sleep or food, and the gun was a heavy load\nfor him.  I gathered from what he said, when the dogs let us know they\nwere coming, that this hound took your money.  Your dog barked and\nawakened the boy and he loaded the gun and followed.  The fellow had a\ngood start and he didn't get him until near daybreak.  It's been a\nstiff pull for the youngster and he seems to feel it was his fault that\nthis cowardly cur you sheltered learned where you kept your money.  If\nthat is true, I hope you won't be hard on him!\"\n\nFather was unfastening Leon's neckband, mother was rubbing his hands,\nCandace was taking off his shoes, and May was spilling water father had\ncalled for, all over the carpet, she shook so.  When Leon drew a deep\nbreath and his head rolled on the pillow, father looked at Mr. Pryor.\nI don't think he heard all of it, but he caught the last words.\n\n\"'Hard on him!  Hard on him!'\" he said, the tears rolling down his\ncheeks.  \"'This my son, who was lost, is found!'\"\n\n\"Oh!\" shouted Mr. Pryor, slamming the money on the table.  \"Poor drivel\nto fit the circumstances.  If I stood in your boots, sir, I would rise\nup in the mighty strength of my pride and pull out foundation stones\nuntil I shook the nation!  I never envied mortal man as I envy you\nto-day!\"\n\nCandace cried out:  \"Oh look, his poor feet!  They are blistered and\nbleeding!\"\n\nMother moved down a little, gathered them in her arms, and began\nkissing them.  Father wet Leon's lips and arose.  He held out his hand,\nand Mr. Pryor took it.\n\n\"I will pray God,\" he said, \"that it may happen 'even so' to you.\"\n\nLeon opened his eyes and caught only the last words.\n\n\"You had better look out for the 'Even So's,' father,\" he said.\n\nAnd father had to laugh, but Mr. Pryor went out, and slammed the door,\nuntil I looked to see if it had cracked from top to bottom; but we\ndidn't care if it had, we were so happy over having Leon back.\n\nI went and picked up the money and carried it to father to put away,\nand that time he took it.  But even then he didn't stop to see if he\nhad all of it.\n\n\"You see!\" I said, \"I told you----\"\n\n\"You did indeed!\" said father.  \"And you almost saved our reason.\nThere are times when things we have come to feel we can't live without,\nso press us, that money seems of the greatest importance.  This is our\nlesson.  Hereafter, I and all my family, who have been through this,\nwill know that money is not even worth thinking about when the life and\nhonour of one you love hangs in the balance.  When he can understand,\nyour brother shall know of the wondrous faith his Little Sister had in\nhim.\"\n\n\"Maybe he won't like what you and mother thought.  Maybe we better not\ntell him.  I can keep secrets real well.  I have several big ones I've\nnever told, and I didn't say a word about the Station when Leon said I\nshouldn't.\"\n\n\"After this there will be no money kept on the place,\" said father.\n\"It's saving time at too great cost.  All we have goes into the bank,\nand some of us will cheerfully ride for what we want, when we need it.\nAs for not telling Leon, that is as your mother decides.  For myself, I\nbelieve I'd feel better to make a clean breast of it.\"\n\nMother heard, for she sobbed as she bathed Leon's feet, and when his\neyes came open so they'd stay a little while, he kept looking at her so\nfunny, between sips of hot milk.\n\n\"Don't CRY, mammy!\" he said.  \"I'M all right.  Sorry such a rumpus!\nLet him fool me.  Be smart as the next fellow, after this!  Know how\nglad you are to get the money!\"\n\nMother sat back on her heels and roared as I do when I step in a\nbumblebee's nest, and they get me.  Leon was growing better every\nminute, and he stared at her, and then his dealish, funny old grin\nbegan to twist his lips and he cried:  \"Oh golly!  You thought _I_\nhelped take it and went with him, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Oh my son, my son!\" wailed mother until she made me think of Absalom\nunder the oak.\n\n\"Well, I be ding-busted!\" said Leon, sort of slow and wondering-like,\nand father never opened his head to tell him that was no way to talk.\n\nMother cried more than ever, and between sobs she tried to explain that\nI heard what the traveller man had said about how bad it was to live in\nthe country; and how Leon was now at an age where she'd known boys to\nget wrong ideas, and how things looked, and in the middle of it he\nraised on his elbow and took her in his arms and said:  \"Well of all\nthe geese!  And I 'spose father was in it too!  But since it's the\nfirst time, and since it is you----!  Go to bed now, and let me\nsleep----  But see that you don't ever let this happen again.\"\n\nThen he kissed her over and over and clung to her tight and at last\ndropped back and groaned:\n\n  \"My reputation, O my reputation!\n   I've lost my reputation!\"\n\n\nShe had to laugh while the tears were still running, and father and\nLaddie looked at each other and shouted.  I guess they thought Leon was\nabout right after that.  Laddie went and bent over him and took his\nhand.\n\n\"Don't be in quite such a hurry, old man,\" he said.  \"Before you wink\nout I have got to tell you how proud I am of having a brother who is a\nreal Crusader.  The Lord knows this took nerve!  You're great, boy,\nsimply great!\"\n\nLeon grabbed Laddie's hand with both of his and held tight and laughed.\nYou could see the big tears squeeze out, although he fought to wink\nthem back.  He held to Laddie and said low-like, only for him to hear:\n\"It's all right if you stay by a while, old man.\"\n\nHe began to talk slowly.\n\n\"It was a long time before I caught up, and then I had to hide, and\nfollow until day, and he wasn't so very easy to handle.  Once I thought\nhe had me sure!  It was an awful load, but if it hadn't been for the\ngood old gun, I'd never have got him.  When we mixed up, I had fine\nluck getting that chin punch on him; good thing I worked it out so\nslick on Absalom Saunders, and while old Even So was groggy I got the\nmoney away from him, took the gun, and stood back some distance, before\nhe came out of it.  Once we had it settled who walked ahead, and who\ncarried the money and gun, we got along better, but I had to keep an\neye on him every minute.  To come through the woods was the shortest,\nbut I'm tired out, and so is he.  Getting close I most felt sorry for\nhim, he was so forlorn, and so scared about what would be done to him.\nHe stopped and pulled out another roll, and offered me all of it, if\nI'd let him go.  I didn't know whether it was really his, or part of\nfather's, so I told him he could just drop it until I found out.  Made\nhim sweat blood, but I had the gun, and he had to mind.  I was master\nthen.  So there may be more in the roll I gave father than Even So\ntook.  Father can figure up and keep what belongs to him.  Even So had\ngone away past Flannigans' before I tackled him, and I was sleepy,\ncold, and hungry; you'd have thought there'd have been a man out\nhunting, or passing on the road, but not a soul did we see 'til\nPryors'!  Say, the old man was bully!  He helped me so, I almost\nthought I belonged to him!  My! he's fine, when you know him!  After he\ncame on the job, you bet old Even So walked up.  Say, where is he?\nHave you fed him?\"\n\nLaddie looked at father, who was listening, and we all rushed to the\ndoor, but it must have been an hour, and Even So hadn't waited.  Father\nsaid it was a great pity, because a man like that shouldn't be left to\nprey on the community; but mother said she didn't want to be mixed up\nwith a trial, or to be responsible for taking the liberty of a fellow\ncreature, and father said that was exactly like a woman.  Leon went to\nsleep, but none of us thought of going to bed; we just stood around and\nlooked at him, and smiled over him, and cried about him, until you\nwould have thought he had been shipped to us in a glass case, and cost,\nmaybe, a hundred dollars.\n\nFather got out his books and figured up his own and the road money, and\nMiss Amelia's, and the church's.  Laddie didn't want her around, so he\nstopped at the schoolhouse and told her to stay at Justices' that\nnight, we'd need all our rooms; but she didn't like being sent away\nwhen there was such excitement, but every one minded Laddie when he\nsaid so for sure.\n\nWhen father had everything counted there was more than his, quite a lot\nof it, stolen from other people who sheltered the traveller no doubt,\nfather said.  We thought he wouldn't be likely to come back for it, and\nfather said he was at loss what to do with it, but Laddie said he\nwasn't--it was Leon's--he had earned it; so father said he would try to\nfind out if anything else had been stolen, and he'd keep it a year, and\nthen if no one claimed it, he would put it on interest until Leon\ndecided what he wanted to do with it.\n\nWhen you watched Leon sleep you could tell a lot more about what had\nhappened to him than he could.  He moaned, and muttered constantly, and\npanted, and felt around for the gun, and breathed like he was running\nagain, and fought until Laddie had to hold him on the couch, and\nfinally awakened him.  But it did no good; he went right off to sleep\nagain, and it happened all over.  Then father began getting his\nCrusader blood up, although he always said he was a man of peace.  But\nit was a lucky thing Even So got away; for after father had watched\nLeon a while, he said if that man had been on the premises, his fingers\nitched so to get at him, he was positive he'd have vented a little\nrighteous indignation on him that would have cost him within an inch of\nhis life.  And he'd have done it too!  He was like that.  It took a\nlot, and it was slow coming, but when he became angry enough, and felt\njustified in it, why you'd be much safer to be some one else than the\nman who provoked him.\n\nAfter ten o'clock the dog barked, some one tapped, and father went; he\nalways would open the door; you couldn't make him pretend he was\nasleep, or not at home when he was, and there stood Mr. Pryor.  He said\nthey could see the lights and they were afraid the boy was ill, and\ncould any of them help.  Father said there was nothing they could do;\nLeon was asleep.  Then Mr. Pryor said:  \"If he is off sound, so it\nwon't disturb him, I would like to see him again.\"\n\nFather told him Leon was restless, but so exhausted a railroad train\nwouldn't waken him, so Mr. Pryor came in and went to the couch.  He\ntook off his hat, like you do beside a grave, while his face slowly\ngrew whiter than his hair, and that would be snow-white; then he turned\nat last and stumbled toward the door.  Laddie held it for him, but he\ndidn't seem to remember he was there.  He muttered over and over:\n\"Why?  Why?  In the name of God, why?\"  Laddie followed to the gate to\nhelp him on his horse, because he thought he was almost out of his\nhead, but he had walked across the fields, so Laddie kept far behind\nand watched until he saw him go safely inside his own door.\n\nI think father and Laddie sat beside Leon all night.  The others went\nto sleep.  A little after daybreak, just as Laddie was starting to\nfeed, there was an awful clamour, and here came a lot of neighbours\nwith Even So.  Mr. Freshett had found him asleep in a cattle hole in\nthe straw stack, and searched him, and he had more money, and that made\nMr. Freshett sure; and as he was very strong, and had been for years a\nsoldier, and really loved to fight, he marched poor Even So back to our\nhouse.  Every few rods they met more men out searching who came with\nthem, until there were so many, our front yard and the road were\ncrowded.  Of all the sights you ever saw, Even So looked the worst.\nYou could see that he'd drop over at much more.  Those men kept crying\nthey were going to hang him; but mother went out and talked to them,\nand said they mustn't kill a man for taking only money.  She told them\nhow little it was worth compared with other things; she had Candace\nbring Even So a cup of hot coffee, lots of bread, and sausage from the\nskillet, and she said it was our money, and our lad, and we wanted\nnothing done about it.  The men didn't like it, but the traveller did.\nHe grabbed and gobbled like a beast at the hot food and cried, and\nmother said she forgave him, and to let him go.\n\nThen Mr. Freshett looked awful disappointed, and he came up to father,\nwith his back toward mother, and asked:  \"That's your say too, Mr.\nStanton?\"  Father grinned sort of rueful-like, but he said to give Even\nSo his money and let him go.  He told all about getting ours back, and\nhaving had him at the house once before.  He brought the money Leon\ntook from him, but the men said no doubt he had stolen that, and Leon\nhad earned it bringing him back, so the traveller shouldn't have it.\nThey took him away on a horse and said they'd let him go, but that\nthey'd escort him from the county.  Father told Mr. Freshett that he\nwas a little suspicious of them, and he would hold him responsible for\nthe man's life.  Mr. Freshett said that he'd give his word that the man\nwould be safe; they only wanted to make sure he wouldn't come back, and\nthat he'd be careful in the future how he abused hospitality, so they\nwent, and all of us were glad of it.\n\nI don't know what Mr. Freshett calls safe, for they took Even So to\nGroveville and locked him up until night.  Then they led him to the\nrailroad, and made him crawl back and forth through an old engine\nbeside the track, until he was blacker than any negro ever born; and\nthen they had him swallow a big dose of croton oil for his health.\nThat was the only KIND thing they did, for afterward they started him\ndown the track and told him to run, and all of them shot at his feet as\nhe went.  Hannah Freshett told me at school the next day.  Her father\nsaid Even So just howled, and flew up in the air, and ducked, and\ndodged and ran like he'd never walked a step, or was a bit tired.  We\nmade a game of it, and after that one of the boys was Even So, and the\nothers were the mob, and the one who could howl nicest, jump highest,\nand go fastest, could be \"It\" oftenest.\n\nLeon grew all right faster than you would think.  He went to school day\nafter next, and the boys were sick with envy.  They asked and asked,\nbut Leon wouldn't tell much.  He didn't seem to like to talk about it,\nand he wouldn't play the game or even watch us.  He talked a blue\nstreak about the money.  Father was going to write to every sheriff of\nthe counties along the way the man said he had come, and if he could\nfind no one before spring who had been robbed, he said Leon might do\nwhat he liked with the money.  I used to pretend it was coming to me,\nand each day I thought of a new way to spend it.  Leon was so sure he'd\nget it he marched right over and asked Mr. Pryor about a nice young\nthoroughbred horse, from his stables, and when he came back he could\nget a coltlike one so very cheap that father and Laddie looked at each\nother and gasped, and never said a word.  They figured up, and if Leon\ngot the money, he could have the horse, and save some for college, and\nfrom the start he never changed a mite about those two things he wanted\nto do with it.  He had the horse picked out and went to the field to\nfeed and pet it and make it gentle, so he could ride bareback, and\nmother said he would be almost sick if the owner of the money turned up.\n\nPulling his boots one night, father said so too, and that the thoughts\nof it worried him.  He said Mr. Pryor had shaded his price so that if\nthe money had to go, he would be tempted to see if we couldn't manage\nit ourselves.  I don't know how shading the price of a horse would make\nher feel better, but it did, and maybe Leon is going to get it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nLaddie Takes the Plunge\n\n  \"This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth\n  The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,\n  And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;\n  The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,\n  And, when he thinks, good, easy man, full surely\n  His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,\n  And then he falls, as I do.\"\n\n\n\"Watch me take the plunge!\" said Laddie.\n\n\"'Mad frenzy fires him now,'\" quoted Leon.\n\nIt was Sunday after dinner.  We had been to church and Sunday-school in\nthe forenoon, and we had a houseful of company for dinner.  All of them\nremained to spend the afternoon, because in our home it was perfectly\nlovely.  We had a big dinner with everything good to start on, and then\nwe talked and visited and told all the news.  The women exchanged new\nrecipes for cooking, advised each other about how to get more work done\nwith less worry, to doctor their sick folks, and to make their dresses.\nAt last, when every thing was talked over, and there began to be a\nquiet time, father would reach across the table, pick up a paper and\nread all the interesting things that had happened in the country during\nthe past week; the jokes too, and they made people think of funny\nstories to tell, and we just laughed.  In the Agriculturist there were\nnew ways to farm easier, to make land bear more crops; so he divided\nthat with the neighbours, also how to make gardens, and prune trees.\nBefore he finished, he always managed to work in a lot about being\nhonest, kind, and loving God.\n\nHe and mother felt so good over Leon, and by this time they were\nbeginning to see that they were mighty glad about the money too.  It\nwouldn't have been so easy to work, and earn, and pay back all that for\nour school, roads, and the church; and every day you could see plainer\nhow happy they felt that they didn't have to do it.  Because they were\nso glad about these things, they invited every one they met that day;\nbut we knew Saturday mother felt that probably she would ask a crowd,\nfrom the chickens, pie, and cake she got ready.  When the reading part\nwas over, and the women were beginning to look at the clock, and you\nknew they felt they should go home, and didn't want to, Laddie arose\nand said that, and Leon piped up like he always does and made every one\nlaugh.  Of course they looked at Laddie, and no one knew what he meant,\nso all the women and a few of the men asked him.\n\n\"Watch me, I said,\" laughed Laddie as he left the room.\n\nSoon Mrs. Dover, sitting beside the front window, cried:  \"Here he is\nat the gate!\"\n\nHe was on his horse, but he hitched it and went around the house and up\nthe back way.  Before long the stair door of the sitting-room opened,\nand there he stood.  We stared at him.  Of course he was bathed, and in\nclean clothing to start with, but he had washed and brushed some more,\nuntil he shone.  His cheeks were as smooth and as clear pink as any\ngirl's, his eyes blue-gray and big, with long lashes and heavy brows.\nHis hair was bright brown and wavy, and he was so big and broad.  He\nnever had been sick a day in his life, and he didn't look as if he ever\nwould be.\n\nAnd clothes DO make a difference.  He would have had exactly the same\nhair, face, and body, wearing a hickory shirt and denim trousers; but\nhe wouldn't have looked as he did in the clothes he wore at college,\nwhen it was Sunday there, or he was invited to a party at the\nPresident's.  I don't see how any man could possibly be handsomer or\nlook finer.  His shirt, collar, and cuffs were snow-white, like\neverything had to be before mother got through with it; his big loose\ntie almost reached his shoulders; and our men could do a thing no other\nman in the neighbourhood did: they could appear easier in the finest\nsuit they could put on than in their working clothes.\n\nMother used to say one thing she dreaded about Sunday was the evident\ntortures of the poor men squirming in boots she knew pinched them,\ncoats too tight, and collars too high.  She said they acted like\nhalf-broken colts fretting over restriction.  Always she said to father\nand the boys when they went to buy their new clothes:  \"Now, DON'T join\nthe harness fighters!  Get your clothing big enough to set your bodies\nwith comfort and ease.\"\n\nI suppose those other men would have looked like ours if their mothers\nhad told them.  You can always see that a man needs a woman to help him\nout awful bad.\n\nOf course Laddie knew he was handsome; he had to know all of them were\nlooking at him curiously, but he stood there buttoning his glove and\nlaughing to himself until Sarah Hood asked:  \"Now what are you up to?\"\n\nHe took a step toward her, ran one hand under her lanternjawed chin,\npulled her head against his side and turned up her face.\n\n\"Sarah,\" he said, \"'member the day we spoiled the washing?\"\n\nEvery one laughed.  They had made jokes about it until our friends knew\nwhat they meant.\n\n\"What are you going to spoil now?\" asked Sarah.\n\n\"The Egyptians!  The 'furriners.' I'm going right after them!\"\n\n\"Well, you could be in better business,\" said Sarah Hood sharply.\n\nLaddie laughed and squeezed her chin, and hugged her head against him.\n\n\"Listen to that, now!\" he cried.  \"My best friend going back on me.\nSarah, I thought you, of all people, would wish me luck.\"\n\n\"I do!\" she said instantly.  \"And that's the very reason I don't want\nyou mixed up with that mysterious, offish, stuck-up mess.\"\n\n\"Bless your dear heart!\" said Laddie, giving her a harder squeeze than\never.  \"You got that all wrong, Sarah.  You'll live to see the day,\nvery shortly, when you'll change every word of it.\"\n\n\"I haven't done anything but get surer about it every day for two\nyears, anyway,\" said Sarah Hood.\n\n\"Exactly!\" said Laddie, \"but wait until I have taken the plunge!  Let\nme tell you how the Pryor family strikes me.  I think he is a\nhigh-tempered, domineering man, proud as Lucifer!  For some cause, just\nor not, he is ruining his life and that of his family because he so\nfirmly believes it just; he is hiding here from his home country, his\nrelatives, and friends.  I think she is, barring you and mother, the\nhandsomest woman of her age I ever saw----\"\n\nAll of them laughed, because Sarah Hood was nearly as homely as a woman\ncould grow, and maybe other people didn't find our mother so lovely as\nwe thought her.  I once heard one of her best friends say she was\n\"distinctly plain.\"  I didn't see how she could; but she said that.\n\n\"--and the most pitiful,\" Laddie went on.  \"Sarah, what do you suppose\nsends a frail little woman pacing the yard, and up and down the road,\nsometimes in storm and rain, gripping both hands over her heart?\"\n\n\"I suppose it's some shameful thing I don't want you mixed up with!\"\nsaid Sarah Hood promptly, and people just shouted.\n\n\"Sarah,\" said Laddie, \"I've seen her closely, watched her move, and\nstudied her expression.  There's not one grain of possibility that you,\nor mother, or Mrs. Fall, or any woman here, could be any closer\nconnected with SHAME.  Shame there is,\" said Laddie, \"and what a word!\nHow it stings, burns, withers, and causes heart trouble and hiding; but\nshame in connection with that woman, more than shame thrust upon her,\nwhich might come to any of us, at any time, shame that is her error, in\nthe life of a woman having a face like hers, Sarah, I am ashamed of\nyou!  Your only excuse is that you haven't persisted as I have until\nyou got to see for yourself.\"\n\n\"I am not much on persistence in the face of a locked door, a cast-iron\nman with a big cane, and two raving bulldogs,\" said Mrs. Hood.  \"Wait,\nyoung man!  Just wait until he sets them on you.\"\n\nLaddie's head went back and how he laughed.\n\n\"Hist!  A word with you, Sarah!\" he said.  \"'Member I have a sort of\nknack with animals.  I never yet have failed with one I undertook to\nwin.  Now those bulldogs of Pryors' are as mild as kittens with a man\nwho knows the right word.  Reason I know, Sarah, I've said the word to\nthem, separately and collectively, and it worked.  There is a contrast,\nSarah, between what I say and do to those dogs, and the kicks and\ncurses they get from their owner.  I'll wager you two to one that if\nyou can get Mr. Pryor to go into a 'sic-ing' contest with me, I can\nhave his own dogs at his throat, when he can't make them do more than\nto lick my hands.\"\n\nThey laughed as if that were funny.\n\n\"Well, I didn't know about this,\" said Sarah.  \"How long have you lived\nat Pryors'?\"\n\nYou couldn't have heard what Laddie said if he'd spoken; so he waited\nuntil he could be heard, and it never worried him a speck.\n\nHe only stood and laughed too; then, \"Long enough,\" he said, \"to know\nthat all of us are making a big and cruel mistake in taking them at\ntheir word, and leaving them penned up there weltering in misery.  What\nwe should do, is to go over there, one at a time, or in a body, and\nbatter at the door of their hearts, until we break down the wall of\npride they have built around them, ease their pain, and bring them with\nus socially, if they are going to live among us.  You people who talk\nloudly and often about loving God, and 'doing unto others,' should have\ngone long ago, for Jesus' sake; I'm going for the sake of a girl, with\na face as sweet, and a heart as pure, as any accepted angel at the foot\nof the throne.  Mother, I want a cup of peach jelly, and some of that\nexceptionally fine cake you served at dinner, to take to our sick\nneighbour.\"\n\nMother left the room.\n\n\"Father, I want permission to cut and carry a generous chestnut branch,\nburred, and full fruited, to the young woman.  There is none save ours\nin this part of the country, and she may never have seen any, and be\ninterested.  And I want that article about foot disease in horses, for\nMr. Pryor.  I'll bring it back when he finishes.\"\n\nFather folded the paper and handed it to Laddie, who slipped it in his\npocket.\n\n\"Take the finest branch you can select,\" father said, and I almost fell\nover.\n\nHe had carried those trees from Ohio, before I had been born, and\nmother said for years he wrapped them in her shawl in winter and held\nan umbrella over them in summer, and father always went red and grinned\nwhen she told it.  He was wild about trees, and bushes, so he made up\nhis mind he'd have chestnuts.  He planted them one place, and if they\ndidn't like it, he dug them up and set them another where he thought\nthey could have what they needed and hadn't got the last place.\nFinally, he put them, on the fourth move, on a little sandy ridge\nacross the road from the wood yard, and that was the spot.  They shot\nup, branched, spread, and one was a male and two were females, so the\npollen flew, the burrs filled right, and we had a bag of chestnuts to\nsend each child away from home, every Christmas.  The brown leaves and\nburrs were so lovely, mother cut one of the finest branches she could\nselect and hung it above the steel engraving of \"Lincoln Freeing the\nSlaves,\" in the boys' room, and nothing in the house was looked at\noftener, or thought prettier.  That must have been what was in the back\nof Laddie's head when he wanted a branch for the Princess.\n\nMother came in with the cake and jelly in a little fancy basket, and\nLaddie said:  \"Thank you!  Now every one wish me luck!  I'm going to\nride to Pryors', knock at the door, and present these offerings with my\ncompliments.  If I'm invited in, I'm going to make the effort of my\nlife at driving the entering wedge toward social intercourse between\nPryors and their neighbours.  If I'm not, I'll be back in thirty\nminutes and tell you what happened to me.  If they refuse my gifts, you\nshall have the jelly, Sarah; I'll give Mrs. Fall the olive branch,\nbring back the paper, and eat the cake to console my wounded spirits.\"\n\nOf course every one laughed; they couldn't help it.  I watched father\nand he laughed hardest of the men, but mother was more stiff-lipped\nabout it; she couldn't help a little, though.  And I noticed some of\nthose women acted as if they had lost something.  Maybe it was a chance\nto gossip about Laddie, for he hadn't left them a thing to guess at,\nand mother says the reason gossip is so dreadful is because it is\nalways GUESSWORK.  Well, that was all fair and plain.  He had told\nthose people, our very best friends, what he thought about everything,\nthe way they acted included.  He was carrying something to each member\nof the Pryor family, and he'd left a way to return joking and\nunashamed, if they wouldn't let him in.  He had fixed things so no one\nhad anything to guess at, and it would look much worse for the Pryors\nthan it would for him, if he did come back.\n\nI wondered if he had been born that smart, or if he learned it in\ncollege.  If he did, no wonder Leon was bound to go.  Come to think of\nit, though, mother said Laddie was always like that.  She said he never\nbit her when he nursed; he never mauled her as if she couldn't be hurt\nwhen he was little, he never tore his clothes and made extra work as he\ngrew, and never in his life gave her an hour's uneasiness.  But I guess\nshe couldn't have said that about uneasiness lately, for she couldn't\nkeep from looking troubled as all of us followed to the gate to see him\nstart.\n\nHow they joked, and tried to tease him!  But they couldn't get a breath\nahead.  He shot back answers as fast as they could ask questions, while\nhe cut the branch and untied the horse.  He gave the limb and basket to\nmother to hold, kissed her good-bye, and me too, before he mounted.\nWith my arms around his neck--I never missed a chance to try to squeeze\ninto him how I loved him--I whispered:  \"Laddie, is it a secret any\nmore?\"\n\nHe threw back his head and laughed the happiest.\n\n\"Not the ghost of a secret!\" he said.  \"But you let me do the talking,\nuntil I tell you.\"  Then he went on right out loud: \"I'm riding up the\nroad waving the banner of peace.  If I suffer repulse, the same thing\nhas happened to better men before, so I'll get a different banner and\ntry again.\"\n\nLaddie mounted, swept a circle in the road, dropped Flos on her knees\nin a bow, and waved the branch.  Leon began to sing at the top of his\nvoice, \"Nothing but leaves, nothing but leaves,\" while Laddie went\nflashing up the road.\n\nThe women went back to the house; the men stood around the gate,\nwatched him from sight, talked about his horse, how he rode, and made\nwagers that he'd get shut out, like every one did, but they said if\nthat happened he wouldn't come back.  Father was annoyed.\n\n\"You heard Laddie say he'd return immediately if they wouldn't let him\nin,\" he said.  \"He's a man of his word.  He will either enter or come\nhome at once.\"\n\nIt was pitch dark and we had supper before some of them left; they\nnever stayed so late.  After we came from church, father read the\nchapter and we were ready for bed; still Laddie hadn't come back.  And\nfather liked it!  He just plain liked it!  He chuckled behind the\nAdvocate until you could see it shake; but mother had very little to\nsay, and her lips closed tight.\n\nAt bedtime he said to mother:  \"Well, they don't seem in a hurry about\nsending the boy back.\"\n\n\"Did you really think he WOULD be sent back?\" asked mother.\n\n\"Not ordinarily,\" said father, \"no!  If he had no brain, no wit, no\nculture, on an animal basis, a woman would look twice before she'd send\nhim away; but with such fanatics as Pryors, one can't always tell what\nwill happen.\"\n\n\"In a case like this, one can be reasonably certain,\" said mother.\n\n\"You don't know what social position they occupied at home.  Their\nearmarks are all good.  We've no such notions here as they have.\"\n\n\"Thank God for so much, at any rate,\" said mother.  \"How old England\nwould rise up and exult if she had a man in line with Laddie's body,\nblood and brain, to set on her throne.  This talk about class and\nsocial position makes me sick.  Men are men, and Laddie is as much\nabove the customary timber found in kings and princes, physically and\nmentally, as the sky is above the earth.  Talk me no talk about class!\nIf I catch it coming from any of mine, save you, I will beat it out of\nthem.  He has admitted he's in love with the girl; the real question\nis, whether she's fit to be his wife.\"\n\n\"I should say she appears so,\" said father.\n\n\"Drat appearances!\" cried mother.  \"When it's a question of lifetime\nmisery, and the soul's salvation of my son, if things go wrong, I've no\ntime for appearances.  I want to know!\"\n\nHe might have known he would make her angry when he laughed.  She\npunched the pillow, and wouldn't say another word; so I went to sleep,\nand didn't miss anything that time.\n\nNext morning at breakfast Laddie was beaming, and father hardly waited\nto ask the blessing before he inquired:  \"Well, how did you make it,\nson?\"\n\nLaddie laughed and answered:  \"Altogether, it might have been much\nworse.\"\n\nThat was all he would say until Miss Amelia started to school, then he\ntook me on his lap and talked as he buttoned my coat.\n\n\"Thomas met me at the gate,\" he said, \"and held my horse while I went\nto the door.  One of their women opened it, and I inquired for Mr.\nPryor.  She said he was in the field looking at the horses, so I asked\nfor Miss Pryor.  She came in a minute, so I gave her the branch, told\nher about it, and offered the jelly and cake for her mother.  The\nPrincess invited me to enter.  I told her I couldn't without her\nfather's permission, so I went to the field to see him.  The dogs were\nwith him and he had the surprise of his life when his man-eaters rolled\nat my feet, and licked my hands.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" chuckled father.\n\n\"Told Thomas they'd been overfed and didn't amount to a brass farthing;\nto take them to the woods and shoot them.  Thomas said he'd see to it\nthe very first thing in the morning, and then Mr. Pryor told him he\nwould shoot him if he did.\"\n\n\"Charming man to work for,\" said mother.\n\n\"Then I told him I'd been at the house to carry a little gift to his\nwife and daughter, and to inquire if I might visit an hour, and as he\nwas not there, I had come to the field to ask him.  Then I looked him\nin the eye and said:  'May I?'\n\n\"'I'll warrant the women asked you to come in,' he said.\n\n\"'Miss Pryor was so kind,' I answered, 'but I enter no man's house\nwithout his permission.  May I talk with your daughter an hour, and\nyour wife, if she cares to see me?'\n\n\"'It makes no earthly difference to me,' he said, which was not\ngracious, but might have been worse, so I thanked him, and went back to\nthe house.  When I knocked the second time, the Princess came, and I\ntold her the word was that it made 'no difference to her father' if I\ncame in, so she opened the door widely, took my hat and offered me a\nseat.  Then she went to the next room and said:  'Mother, father has\ngiven Mr. Stanton permission to pay us a call.  Do you feel able to\nmeet him?'  She came at once, offering her hand and saying:  'I have\nalready met Mr. Stanton so often, really, we should have the privilege\nof speaking.'\"\n\n\"What did she mean by that?\" asked mother.\n\n\"She meant that I have haunted the road passing their place for two\nyears, and she'd seen me so frequently that she came to recognize me.\"\n\n\"Umph!\" said mother.\n\n\"Laddie tell on!\" I begged.\n\n\"Well, I sharpened all the wits I had and went to work.  I never tried\nso hard in my life to be entertaining.  Of course I had to feel my way.\nI'd no idea what would interest a delicate, high-bred lady\"--mother\nsniffed again--\"so I had to search and probe, and go by guess until I\nsaw a shade of interest, then I worked in more of the same.  It was\neasy enough to talk to the Princess--all young folks have a lot in\ncommon, we could get along on fifty topics; it was different with the\nhousebound mother.  I did my best, and after a while Mr. Pryor came in.\nI asked him if any of his horses had been attacked with the trouble\nsome of the neighbours were having, and told him what it was.  He had\nthe grace to thank me.  He said he would tell Thomas not to tie his\nhorse at the public hitching rack when he went to town, and once he got\nstarted, he was wild to talk with a man, and I'd no chance to say a\nword to the women.  He was interested in our colleges, state, and\nnational laws, in land development, and everything that all live men\nare.  When a maid announced dinner I apologized for having stayed so\nlong, and excused myself, because I had been so interested, but Mrs.\nPryor merely said:  'I'm waiting to be offered your arm.'\n\n\"Well, you should have seen me drop my hat and step up.  I did my best,\nand while I talked to him a little, I made it most to the women.  Any\none could see they were starved for company, so I took the job of\nentertaining them.  I told some college jokes, funny things that had\nhappened in the neighbourhood, and everything of interest I could think\nup.  I know we were at the table for two hours with things coming and\ngoing on silver platters.\"\n\nMother sat straight suddenly.\n\n\"Just what did they have to eat, and how did they serve it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Couldn't tell if I were to be shot for it, mummy,\" said Laddie.\n\"Forgive me!  Next time I'll take notes for you.  This first plunge, I\nhad to use all my brains, not to be a bore to them; and to handle food\nand cutlery as the women did.  It's quite a process, but as they were\nserved first, I could do right by waiting.  I never was where things\nwere done quite so elaborately before.\"\n\n\"And they didn't know they would have company until you went to the\ntable?\"\n\n\"Well, they must have thought likely, there was a place for me.\"\n\n\"Umph!\" said mother.  \"Fine idea!  Then any one who drops in can be\nserved, and see that they are not a mite of trouble.  Candace, always\nan extra place after this!\"\n\nFather just shouted.\n\n\"I thought you'd get something out of it!\" he said.\n\n\"Happy to have justified your faith!\" replied mother calmly.  \"Go on,\nson!\"\n\n\"That's all!\" said Laddie.  \"We left the table and talked an hour more.\nThe women asked me to come again; he didn't say anything on that\nsubject; but when he ordered my horse, he asked the Princess if she\nwould enjoy a little exercise, and she said she would, so he told\nThomas to bring their horses, and we rode around the section, the\nPrincess and I ahead, Mr. Pryor following.  Where the road was good and\nthe light fine enough that there was no danger of laming a horse, we\ndropped back, one on either side of him, so we could talk.  Mrs. Pryor\nate the cake and said it was fine; and the 'conserve,' she called it,\ndelicious as she ever had tasted.  She said all our fruits here had\nmuch more flavour than at home; she thought it was the dryer climate\nand more sunshine.  She sent her grateful thanks, and she wants your\nrecipe before next preserving time.\"\n\nMother just beamed.  My! but she did love to have the things she\ncooked, bragged on.\n\n\"Possibly she'd like my strawberries?\" she said.\n\n\"There isn't a doubt about it,\" said Laddie.  \"I've yet to see the\nfirst person who doesn't.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" asked mother.\n\n\"I can think of nothing more at this minute,\" answered Laddie.  \"If\nanything comes to my mind later, I won't forget to tell you.  Oh yes,\nthere was one thing:  You couldn't keep Mr. Pryor from talking about\nLeon.  He must have taken a great fancy to him.  He talked until he\nworried the Princess, and she tried to keep him away from the subject,\nbut his mind seemed to run on it constantly.  When we were riding she\ntalked quite as much as he, and it will hustle us to think what the\nlittle scamp did, any bigger than they do.  Of course, father, you\nunderstood the price Mr. Pryor made on one of his very finest colts was\na joke.  There's a strain of Arab in the father--he showed me the\nrecord--and the mother is bluegrass.  There you get gentleness and\nendurance combined with speed and nerve.  I'd trade Flos for that colt\nas it stands to-day.  There's nothing better on earth in the way of\nhorse.  His offer is practically giving it away.  I know, with the\nrecords to prove its pedigree, what that colt would bring him in any\ncity market.\"\n\n\"I don't like it,\" said mother.  \"I want Leon to have a horse, but a\nboy in a first experience, and reckless as he is, doesn't need a horse\nlike that, for one thing, and what is more important, I refuse to be\nput under any obligations to Pryors.\"\n\n\"That's the reason Mr. Pryor asked anything at all for the horse.  It\nis my opinion that he would be greatly pleased to give it to Leon, if\nhe could do what he liked.\"\n\n\"Well, that's precisely the thing he can't do in this family,\" said\nmother sternly.\n\n\"What do you think, father?\" asked Laddie.\n\n\"I think Amen! to that proposition,\" said father; \"but I would have to\ntake time to thresh it out completely.  It appeals to me that Leon is\nold enough to recognize the value of the animal; and that the care of\nit would develop and strengthen his character.  It would be a\nresponsibility that would steady him.  You could teach him to tend and\nbreak it.\"\n\n\"Break it!\" cried Laddie.  \"Break it!  Why father, he's riding it\nbareback all over the Pryor meadow now, and jumping it over logs.\nWhenever he leaves, it follows him to the fence, and the Princess says\nalmost any hour of the day you look out you can see it pacing up and\ndown watching this way and whinnying for him to come.\"\n\n\"And your best judgment is----?\"\n\nLaddie laughed as he tied my hood strings.  \"Well I don't feel about\nthe Pryors as the rest of you do,\" he said.  \"If the money isn't\nclaimed inside the time you specified, I would let Leon and Mr. Pryor\nmake their own bargain.  The boy won't know for years that it is\npractically a gift, and it would please Mr. Pryor immensely.  Now run,\nor you'll be late!\"\n\nI had to go, so I didn't know how they settled it, but if they wouldn't\nlet Leon have that horse, it was downright mean.  What if we were under\nobligations to Mr. Pryor?  We were to Sarah Hood, and half the people\nwe knew, and what was more, we LIKED to be.\n\nWhen I came from school that night father had been to town.  He had an\nax and was opening a big crate, containing two of the largest, bluest\ngeese you ever saw.  Laddie said being boxed that way and seeing them\nso close made them look so big; really, they were no finer than\nPryors', where he had got the address of the place that sold them.\nMother was so pleased.  She said she had needed a new strain, for a\nlong time, to improve her feathers; now she would have pillows worth\nwhile, in a few years.  They put them in the barn where our geese\nstayed over night, and how they did scream.  That is, one of them did;\nthe other acted queerly and father said to Laddie that he was afraid\nthe trip was hard on it.  Laddie said it might have been hurt, and\nmother was worried too.  Before she had them an hour, she had sold all\nour ganders; spring had come, she had saved the blue goose eggs, set\nthem under a hen, raised the goslings with the little chickens, never\nlost one, picked them and made a new pair of pillows too fine for any\none less important than a bishop, or a judge, or Dr. Fenner to sleep\non.  Then she began saving for a featherbed.  And still the goose\ndidn't act as spry or feel as good as the gander.  He stuck up his\nhead, screamed, spread his wings and waved them, and the butts looked\nso big and hard, I was not right certain whether it would be safe to\ntease him or not.\n\nThe first person who came to see them was Sarah Hood, and she left with\nthe promise of a pair as soon as mother could raise them.  Father said\nthe only reason mother didn't divide her hair with Sarah Hood was\nbecause it was fast, and she couldn't.  Mother said gracious goodness!\nshe'd be glad to get rid of some of it if she could, and of course\nSarah should have first chance at it.  Hadn't she kept her over night\nso she could see her new home when she was rested, and didn't she come\nwith her, and help her get settled, and had she ever failed when we had\na baby, or sickness, or trouble, or thrashers, or a party?  Of course\nshe'd gladly divide, even the hair of her head, with Sarah Hood.  And\nfather said, \"Yes, he guessed she would, and come to think of it, he'd\njust as soon spare Sarah part of his,\" and then they both laughed, when\nit was nothing so very funny that I could see.\n\nThe next caller the geese had was Mrs. Freshett.  My! she thought they\nwere big and fine.  Mother promised her a couple of eggs to set under a\nhen.  Father said she was gradually coming down the scale of her\nfeelings, and before two weeks she'd give Isaac Thomas, at least, a\nquill for a pen.  Almost no one wrote with them any more, but often\nfather made a few, and showed us how to use them.  He said they were\ngone with candles, sand boxes, and snuff.  Mother said she had no use\nfor snuff, but candles were not gone, she'd make and use them to the\nday of her death, as they were the nicest light ever invented to carry\nfrom room to room, or when you only wanted to sit and think.  Father\nsaid there was really no good pen except the quill you sharpened\nyourself; and while he often used steel ones like we children had at\nschool to write to the brothers and sisters away, and his family, he\nalways kept a few choice quills in the till of his chest, and when he\nwrote a deed, or any valuable paper, where there was a deal with money,\nhe used them.  He said it lent the dignity of a past day to an\nimportant occasion.\n\nAfter mother and Mrs. Freshett had talked over every single thing about\nthe geese, and that they were like Pryors' had been settled, Mrs.\nFreshett said:  \"Since he told about it before all of us, and started\nout the way he did, would it be amiss to ask how Laddie got on at\nPryors'?\"\n\n\"Just the way I thought he would,\" said mother.  \"He stayed until all\nof us were in bed, and I'd never have known when he came in, if it were\nnot a habit of his always to come to my door to see if I'm sleeping.\nSometimes I'm wakeful, and if he pommels my pillow good, brings me a\ndrink, and rubs my head a few strokes with his strong, cool hands, I\ncan settle down and have a good night's rest.  I was awake when he\ncame, or I'd never have known.  It was almost midnight; but they sat\ntwo hours at the table, and then all of them rode.\"\n\n\"Not the Missus?\"\n\n\"Oh no!  She's not strong enough.  She really has incurable heart\ntrouble, the worst kind there is; her daughter told me so.\"\n\n\"Then they better look out,\" said Mrs. Freshett.  \"She is likely to\nkeel over at a breath.\"\n\n\"They must know it.  That's why she keeps so quiet.\"\n\n\"And they had him to supper?\"\n\n\"It was a dinner served at night.  Yes.  He took Mrs. Pryor in on his\narm, and it was like a grand party, just as they fixed for themselves,\nalone.  Waiters, and silver trays, and things carried in and out in\ncourses.\"\n\n\"My land!  Well, I s'pose he had enough schoolin' to get him through it\nall right!\"\n\nMy mother's face grew red.  She never left any one in doubt as to what\nshe meant.  Father said that \"was the Dutch of it.\"  And mother always\nanswered that if any one living could put things plainer than the\nEnglish, she would like to hear them do it.\n\n\"He certainly had,\" said mother, \"or they wouldn't have invited him to\ncome again.  And all mine, Mrs. Freshett, knew how to sit properly at\nthe table, and manage a knife, fork and napkin, before they ever took a\nmeal away from home.\"\n\n\"No 'fence,\" laughed Mrs. Freshett.  \"I meant that maybe his years of\ncollege schoolin' had give him ways more like theirs than most of us\nhave.  For all the money it takes to send a boy to college, he ought to\nget somethin' out of it more than jest fillin' his head with figgers,\nan' stars, an' oratin'; an' most always you can see that he does.\"\n\n\"It is contact with cultivated people,\" said mother.  \"You are always\ninfluenced by it, without knowing it often.\"\n\n\"Maybe you are, bein' so fine yourself,\" said Mrs. Freshett.  \"An' me\ntoo, I never get among my betters that I don't carry home a lot I put\nright into daily use, an' nobody knows it plainer.  I come here\nexpectin' to learn things that help me, an' when I go home I know I\nhave.\"\n\n\"Why, thank you,\" said mother.  \"I'm sure that is a very nice\ncompliment, and I wish I really could feel that it is well deserved.\"\n\n\"Oh I guess you do!\" said Mrs. Freshett laughing.  \"I often noticed you\nmakin' a special effort to teach puddin' heads like me somethin', an' I\nalways thank you for it.  There's a world in right teachin'.  I never\nhad any.  So all I can pick up an' hammer into mine is a gain for me\nan' them.  If my Henry had lived, an' come out anything like that boy\no' yourn an' the show he made last Sunday, I'd do well if I didn't\nswell up an' bust with pride.  An' the little tow-haired strip, takin'\nthe gun an' startin' out alone after a robber, even if he wa'n't much\nof a man, that was downright spunky.  If my boys will come out anywhere\nnear like yourn, I'll be glad.\"\n\n\"I don't know how my boys will come out,\" said mother.  \"But I work,\npray, hope, and hang to them; that's all I know to do.\"\n\n\"Well, if they don't come out right, they ought to be bumped!\" said\nMrs. Freshett.  \"After all the chances they've had!  I don' know jest\nhow Freshett was brung up, but I'd no chance at all.  My folks--well, I\nguess the less said--little pitchers, you know!  I can't see as I was\nto blame.  I was the youngest, an' I knew things was wrong.  I fought\nto go to school, an' pap let me enough that I saw how other people\nlived.  Come night I'd go to the garret, an' bar the trapdoor; but\nthere would be times when I couldn't help seein' what was goin' on.\nHow'd you like chances such as that for a girl of yourn?\"\n\n\"Dreadful!\" said mother.  \"Mrs. Freshett, please do be careful!\"\n\n\"Sure!\" laughed Mrs. Freshett.  \"I was jest goin' to tell you about me\nan' Josiah.  He come to our house one night, a stranger off the road.\nHe said he was sick, an' tired, an' could he have a bed.  Mother said,\n'No, for him to move on.'  He tried an' he couldn't.  They was\nsomethin' about him--well, you know how them things go!  I wa'n't only\nsixteen, but I felt so sorry for him, all fever burned and mumblin', I\nhelped pap put him to bed, an' doctored him all I could.  Come mornin'\nhe was a sick man.  Pap went for the county doctor, an' he took jest\none look an' says: 'Small pox!  All of ye git!'\n\n\"I was bound I wouldn't go, but pap made me, an' the doctor said he'd\nsend a man who'd had it; so I started, but I felt so bad, come a chanct\nwhen they got to Groveville, I slipped out an' went back.  The man\nhadn't come, so I set to work the best I knowed.  'Fore long Josiah was\na little better an' he asked who I was, an' where my folks went, an' I\ntold him, an' he asked WHY I came back an' I didn't know what to say,\nso I jest hung my head an' couldn't face him.  After a while he says,\n'All right!  I guess I got this sized up.  If you'll stay an' nuss me\nthrough, I'll be well enough to pull you out, by the time you get it,\nan' soon as you're able we'll splice, if you say so.'\n\n\"'Marry me, you mean?' says I.  They wa'n't ever any talk about\nmarryin' at our house.  'Sure!' says he.  'You're a mighty likely\nlookin' girl!  I'll do fair by ye.'  An' he always has, too!  But I\ndidn't feel right to let him go it blind, so I jest up and says.  'You\nwouldn't if you knowed my folks!'  'You look as decent as I do,' says\nhe; 'I'll chance it!'  Then I tole him I was as good as I was born, an'\nhe believed me, an' he always has, an' I was too!  So I nussed him, but\nI didn't make the job of it he did.  You 'member he is pitted\nconsiderable.  He was so strong I jest couldn't keep him from\ndisfigerin' himself, but he tied me.  I begged to be loose, an' he\nwouldn't listen, so I got a clean face, only three little scars, an'\nthey ain't deep to speak of.  He says he looks like a piece of side\nmeat, but say! they ain't nothin' the matter with his looks to me!\n\n\"The nuss man never did come, but the county doctor passed things in\nthe winder, till I was over the worst, an' Josiah sent for a preacher\nan' he married us through the winder--I got the writin's to show, all\nframed an' proper.  Josiah said he'd see I got all they was in it long\nthat line, anyway.  When I was well, hanged if he didn't perdooce a wad\nfrom his clothes before they burnt 'em, an' he got us new things to\nwear, an' a horse, an' wagon, an' we driv away here where we thought we\ncould start right, an' after we had the land, an' built the cabin, an'\njest as happy as heart could wish, long come a man I'd made mad once,\nan' he tole everythin' up and down.  Josiah was good about it.  He\noffered to sell the land, an' pull up an' go furder.  'What's the use?'\nsays I.  'Hundreds know it.  We can't go so far it won't be like to\nfollow us; le's stay here an' fight it.'  'All right,' says Josiah, but\ntime an' ag'in he has offered to go, if I couldn't make it.  'Hang on a\nlittle longer,' says I, every time he knew I was snubbed an' slighted.\nI never tole what he didn't notice.  I tried church, when my children\nbegan to git a size I wanted 'em to have right teachin', an' you come\nan' welcomed me an' you been my friend, an' now the others is comin'\nover at last, an' visitin' me, an' they ain't a thing more I want in\nlife.\"\n\n\"I am so glad!\" said mother.  \"Oh my dear, I am so glad!\"\n\n\"Goin' right home an' tell that to Josiah,\" said Mrs. Freshett, jumping\nup laughing and crying like, \"an' mebby I'll jest spread wings and fly!\nI never was so happy in all my life as I was Sunday, when you ast me\nbefore all of them, so cordial like, an' says I to Josiah, 'We'll go\nan' try it once,' an' we come an' nobody turned a cold shoulder on us,\nan' I wa'n't wearin' specks to see if they did, for I never knowed him\nso happy in all his days.  Orter heard him whistle goin' home, an' he's\ntryin' all them things he learned, on our place, an' you can see it\nlooks a heap better a'ready, an' now he's talkin' about buildin' in the\nspring.  I knowed he had money, but he never mentioned buildin' before,\nan' I always thought it was bekase he 'sposed likely we'd have to move\non, some time.  'Pears now as if we can settle, an' live like other\nfolks, after all these years.  I knowed ye didn't want me to talk, but\nI had to tell you!  When you ast us to the weddin', and others began\ncomin' round, says I to Josiah, 'Won't she be glad to know that my\nskirts is clear, an' I did as well as I could?'  An' he says, 'That she\nwill!  An' more am I,' says he.  'I mighty proud of you,' says he.\nProud!  Think of that!  Miss Stanton, I'd jest wade fire and blood for\nyou!\"\n\n\"Oh my dear!\" said mother.  \"What a dreadful thing to say!\"\n\n\"Gimme the chanct, an' watch if I don't,\" said Mrs. Freshett.  \"Now,\nJosiah is proud I stuck it out!  Now, I can have a house!  Now, my\nchildren can have all the show we can raise to give 'em!  I'm done\ncringin' an' dodgin'!  I've always done my best; henceforth I mean to\nhold up my head an' say so.  I sure can't be held for what was done\n'fore I was on earth, or since neither.  You've given me my show, I'm\ngoin' to take it, but if you want to know what's in my heart about you,\ngimme any kind of a chanct to prove, an' see if I don't pony right up\nto it!\"\n\nMother laughed until the tears rolled, she couldn't help it.  She took\nMrs. Freshett in her arms and hugged her tight, and kissed her mighty\nnear like she does Sarah Hood.  Mrs. Freshett threw her arms around\nmother, and looked over her shoulder, and said to me, \"Sis, when you\ngrow up, always take a chanct on welcomin' the stranger, like your maw\ndoes, an' heaven's bound to be your home!  My, but your maw is a woman\nto be proud of!\" she said, hugging mother and patting her on the back.\n\n\"All of us are proud of her!\" I boasted.\n\n\"I doubt if you are proud enough!\" cried Mrs. Freshett.  \"I have my\ndoubts!  I don't see how people livin' with her, an' seein' her every\nday, are in a shape to know jest what she can do for a person in the\nplace I was in.  I have my doubts!\"\n\nThat night when I went home from school mother was worrying over the\nblue goose.  When we went to feed, she told Leon that she was afraid it\nwas weak, and not getting enough to eat when it fed with the others.\nShe said after the work was finished, to take it out alone, and give it\nall it would eat; so when the horses were tended, the cows milked,\neverything watered, and the barn ready to close for the night, Laddie\ntook the milk to the house, while Leon and I caught the blue goose,\ncarried her to the well, and began to shell corn.  She was starved to\ndeath, almost.  She ate a whole ear in no time and looked for more, so\nLeon sent me after another.  By the time that was most gone she began\nto eat slower, and stick her bill in the air to help the grains slip\ndown, so I told Leon I thought she had enough.\n\n\"No such thing!\" said Leon.  \"You distinctly heard mother tell me to\ngive her 'all she would eat.'  She's eating, isn't she?  Go bring\nanother ear!\"\n\nSo she was, but I was doubtful about more.\n\nLeon said I better mind or he would tell mother, so I got it.  She\ndidn't begin on it with any enthusiasm.  She stuck her bill higher,\nstretched her neck longer, and she looked so funny when she did it,\nthat we just shrieked.  Then Leon reached over, took her by the bill,\nand stripped her neck to help her swallow, and as soon as he let go,\nshe began to eat again.\n\n\"You see!\" said Leon, \"she's been starved.  She can't get enough.  I\nmust help her!\"\n\nSo he did help her every little bit.  By that time we were interested\nin seeing how much she could hold; and she looked so funny that Leon\nsent me for more corn; but I told him I thought what she needed now was\nwater, so we held her to the trough, and she tried to drink, but she\ncouldn't swallow much.  We set her down beside the corn, and she went\nto eating again.\n\n\"Go it, old mill-hopper!\" cried Leon.\n\nRight then there was an awful commotion in the barn, and from the\nsquealing we knew one of the horses was loose, and fighting the others.\nWe ran to fix them, and had a time to get Jo back into his stall, and\ntied.  Before we had everything safe, the supper bell rang, and I bet\nLeon a penny I could reach the house while he shut the door and got\nthere.  We forgot every single thing about the goose.\n\nAt supper mother asked Leon if he fed the goose all she would eat, and\nI looked at him guilty-like, for I remembered we hadn't put her back.\nHe frowned at me cross as a bear, and I knew that meant he had\nremembered, and would slip back and put her inside when he finished his\nsupper, so I didn't say anything.\n\n\"I didn't feed her ALL she would eat!\" said Leon.  \"If I had, she'd be\nat it yet.  She was starved sure enough!  You never saw anything like\nthe corn she downed.\"\n\n\"Well I declare!\" said mother.  \"Now after this, take her out alone,\nfor a few days, and give her as much as she wants.\"\n\n\"All right!\" chuckled Leon, because it was a lot of fun to see her run\nher bill around, and gobble up the corn, and stick up her head.\n\nThe next day was Saturday, so after breakfast I went with Leon to drive\nthe sheep and geese to the creek to water; the trough was so high it\nwas only for the horses and cattle; when we let out the geese, the blue\none wasn't there.\n\n\"Oh Leon, did you forget to come back and put her in?\"\n\n\"Yes I did!\" he said.  \"I meant to when I looked at you to keep still,\nand I started to do it, but Sammy Deam whistled, so I went down in the\norchard to see what he wanted, and we got to planning how to get up a\nfox chase, and I stayed until father called for night, and then I ran\nand forgot all about the blame old goose.\"\n\n\"Oh Leon!  Where is she?  What will mother say? 'Spose a fox got her!\"\n\n\"It wouldn't help me any if it had, after I was to blame for leaving\nher outside.  Blast a girl!  If you ever amounted to anything, you\ncould have put her in while I fixed the horses.  At least you could\nhave told me to.\"\n\nI stood there dumblike and stared at him.  He has got the awfulest way\nof telling the truth when he is scared or provoked.  Of course I should\nhave thought of the goose when he was having such a hard fight with the\nhorses.  If I'd been like he was, I'd have told him that he was older,\nmother told HIM to do it, and it wasn't my fault; but in my heart I\nknew he did have his hands full, and if you're your brother's keeper,\nyou ought to HELP your brother remember.  So I stood gawking, while\nLeon slowly turned whiter and whiter.\n\n\"We might as well see if we can find her,\" he said at last, so slow and\nhopeless like it made my heart ache.  So he started around the straw\nstack one way, and I the other, looking into all the holes, and before\nI had gone far I had a glimpse of her, and it scared me so I screamed,\nfor her head was down, and she didn't look right.  Leon came running\nand pulled her out.  The swelled corn rolled in a little trail after\nher, and the pigs ran up and began to eat it.  Pigs are named righter\nthan anything else I know.\n\n\"Busted!\" cried Leon in tones of awe; about the worst awe you ever\nheard, and the worst bust you ever saw.\n\nFrom bill to breast she was wide open, and the hominy spilling.  We\njust stood staring at her, and then Leon began to kick the pigs;\nbecause it would be no use to kick the goose; she would never know.\nThen he took her up, carried her into the barn, and put her on the\nfloor where the other geese had stayed all night.  We stood and looked\nat her some more, as if looking and hoping would make her get up and be\nalive again.  But there's nothing in all this world so useless as\nwishing dead things would come alive; we had to do something.\n\n\"What are you going to tell mother?\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" said Leon.  \"I'm trying to think.\"\n\n\"I'll say it was as much my fault as yours.  I'll go with you.  I'll\ntake half whatever they do to you.\"\n\n\"Little fool!\" said Leon.  \"What good would that do me?\"\n\n\"Do you know what they cost?  Could you get another with some of your\nhorse money?\"\n\nI saw it coming and dodged again, before I remembered the Crusaders.\n\n\"All right!\" I said.  \"If that's the way you are going to act, Smarty,\nI'll lay all the blame on you; I won't help you a bit, and I don't care\nif you are whipped until the blood runs.\"\n\nThen I went out of the barn and slammed the door.  For a minute I felt\nbetter; but it was a short time.  I SAID that to be mean, but I did\ncare.  I cared dreadfully; I was partly to blame, and I knew it.\nComing around the barn, I met Laddie, and he saw in a flash I was in\ntrouble, so he stopped and asked:  \"What now, Chicken?\"\n\n\"Come into the barn where no one will hear us,\" I said.\n\nSo we went around the outside, entered at the door on the embankment,\nand he sat in the wheelbarrow on the threshing floor while I told him.\nI thought I felt badly enough, but after I saw Laddie, it grew worse,\nfor I remembered we were short of money that fall, that the goose was a\nfine, expensive one, and how proud mother was of her, and how she'd be\ngrieved, and that was trouble for sure.\n\n\"Run along and play!\" said Laddie, \"and don't tell any one else if you\ncan help it.  I'll hide the goose, and see if I can get another in time\nto take the place of this one, so mother won't be worried.\"\n\nI walked to the house slowly, but I was afraid to enter.  When you are\nall choked up, people are sure to see it, and ask fool questions.  So I\nwent around to the gate and stood there looking up and down the road,\nand over the meadow toward the Big Woods; and all at once, in one of\nthose high, regular bugle calls, like they mostly scream in spring, one\nof Pryors' ganders split the echoes for a mile; maybe farther.\n\nI was across the road and slinking down inside the meadow fence before\nI knew it.  There was no thought or plan.  I started for Pryors' and\nwent straight ahead, only I kept out of line with our kitchen windows.\nI tramped through the slush, ice, and crossed fields where I was afraid\nof horses; but when I got to the top of the Pryor backyard fence, I\nstuck there, for the bulldogs were loose, and came raving at me.  I was\ngoing to be eaten alive, for I didn't know the word Laddie did; and\nthose dogs climbed a fence like a person; I saw them the time Leon\nbrought back Even So.  I was thinking what a pity it was, after every\none had grown accustomed to me, and had begun loving me, that I should\nbe wasted for dog feed, when Mr. Pryor came to the door, and called\nthem; they didn't mind, so he came to the fence, and crossest you ever\nheard, every bit as bad as the dogs, he cried:  \"Whose brat are you,\nand what are you doing here?\"\n\nI meant to tell him; but you must have a minute after a thing like that.\n\n\"God of my life!\" he fairly frothed.  \"What did anybody send a dumb\nchild here for?\"\n\n\"Dumb child!\"  I didn't care if Mr. Pryor did wear a Crown of Glory.\nIt wasn't going to do him one particle of good, unless he was found in\nthe way of the Lord.  \"Dumb child!\"  I was no more dumb than he was,\nuntil his bulldogs scared me so my heart got all tangled up with my\nstomach, my lungs, and my liver.  That made me mad, and there was\nnothing that would help me to loosen up and talk fast, like losing my\ntemper.  I wondered what kind of a father he had.  If he'd been stood\nagainst the wall and made to recite, \"Speak gently,\" as often as all of\nus, perhaps he'd have remembered the verse that says:\n\n  \"Speak gently to the little child;\n    Its love be sure to gain;\n  Teach it in accents soft and mild;\n    It may not long remain.\"\n\nI should think not, if it had any chance at all to get away!  I was so\nangry by that time I meant to tell him what I thought.  Polite or not\npolite, I'd take a switching if I had to, but I wasn't going to stand\nthat.\n\n\"You haven't got any God in your life,\" I reminded him, \"and no one\nsent me here.  I came to see the Princess, because I'm in awful trouble\nand I hoped maybe she could fix up a way to help me.\"\n\n\"Ye Gods!\" he cried.  He would stick to calling on God, whether he\nbelieved in Him or not.  \"If it isn't Nimrod!  I didn't recognize you\nin all that bundling.\"\n\nProbably he didn't know it, but Nimrod was from the Bible too!  By\nbundling, he meant my hood and coat.  He helped me from the fence, sent\nthe bulldogs rolling--sure enough he did kick them, and they didn't\nlike it either--took my hand and led me straight into the house, and\nthe Princess was there, and a woman who was her mother no doubt, and he\nsaid:  \"Pamela, here is our little neighbour, and she says she's in\ntrouble, and she thinks you may be of some assistance to her.  Of\ncourse you will be glad if you can.\"\n\n\"Surely!\" said the Princess, and she introduced me to her mother, so I\nbowed the best I knew, and took off my wet mitten, dirty with climbing\nfences, to shake hands with her.  She was so gracious and lovely I\nforgot what I went after.  The Princess brought a cloth and wiped the\nwet from my shoes and stockings, and asked me if I wouldn't like a cup\nof hot tea to keep me from taking a chill.\n\n\"I've been much wetter than this,\" I told her, \"and I never have taken\na chill, and anyway my throat's too full of trouble to drink.\"\n\n\"Why, you poor child!\" said the Princess.  \"Tell me quickly!  Is your\nmother ill again?\"\n\n\"Not now, but she's going to be as soon as she finds out,\" I said, and\nthen I told them.\n\nThey all listened without a sound until I got where Leon helped the\ngoose eat, and from that on Mr. Pryor laughed until you could easily\nsee that he had very little feeling for suffering humanity.  It was\nfunny enough when we fed her, but now that she was bursted wide open\nthere was nothing amusing about it; and to roar when a visitor plainly\ntold you she was in awful trouble, didn't seem very good manners to me.\nThe Princess and her mother never even smiled; and before I had told\nnearly all of it, Thomas was called to hitch the Princess' driving\ncart, and she took me to their barnyard to choose the goose that looked\nmost like mother's, and all of them seemed like hers, so we took the\nfirst one Thomas could catch, put it into a bag in the back of the\ncart, and then we got in and started for our barn.  As we reached the\nroad, I said to her:  \"You'd better go past Dovers', for if we come\ndown our Little Hill they will see us sure; it's baking day.\"\n\n\"All right!\" said the Princess, so we went the long way round the\nsection, but goodness me! when she drove no way was far.\n\nWhen we were opposite our barn she stopped, hitched her horse to the\nfence, and we climbed over, and slipping behind the barn, carried the\ngoose around to the pen and put it in with ours.  She said she wanted\nthe broken one, because her father would enjoy seeing it.  I didn't see\nhow he could!  We were ready to slip out, when our geese began to run\nat the new one, hiss and scream, and make such a racket that Laddie and\nLeon both caught us.  They looked at the goose, at me, the Princess,\nand each other, and neither said a word.  She looked back a little bit,\nand then she laughed as hard as she could.  Leon grew red, and he\ngrinned ashamed-like, so she laughed worse than ever.  Laddie spoke to\nme:  \"You went to Mr. Pryor's and asked for that goose?\"\n\n\"She did not!\" said the Princess before I could answer.  \"She never\nasked for anything.  She was making a friendly morning call and in the\ncourse of her visit she told about the pathetic end of the goose that\nwas expected to lay the golden egg--I mean stuff the Bishop's\npillow--and as we have a large flock of blue geese, father gave her\none, and he had the best time he's had in years doing it.  I wouldn't\nhave had him miss the fun he got from it for any money.  He laughed\nlike home again.  Now I must slip away before any one sees me, and\nspoils our secret.  Leon, lad, you can go to the house and tell your\nlittle mother that the feeding stopped every pain her goose had, and\nhereafter it looks to you as if she'd be all right.\"\n\n\"Miss Pryor,\" said Leon, \"did you care about what I said at you in\nchurch that day?\"\n\n\"'Thou art all fair, my love.  There is no spot in thee.'  Well, it was\na little pointed, but since you ask a plain question, I have survived\nit.\"\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry,\" said Leon.  \"Of course I never would, if I'd known\nyou could be this nice.\"\n\nThe Princess looked at Laddie and almost gasped, and then both of them\nlaughed.  Leon saw that he had told her he was sorry he said she was\n\"fair, and no spot in her.\"\n\n\"Oh I don't mean that!\" he said.  \"What I do mean is that I thank you\nawful much for the goose, and helping me out like such a brick of a\ngood fellow, and what I wish is, that I was as old as Laddie, and he'd\nhump himself if he got to be your beau.\"\n\nThe Princess almost ran.  Laddie and I followed to the road, where he\nunhitched the horse and helped her in.  Then he stood stroking its\nneck, as he held the bridle.\n\n\"I don't know what to say!\" said Laddie.\n\n\"In such case, I would counsel silence,\" advised the Princess.\n\n\"I hope you understand how I thank you.\"\n\n\"I fail to see what for.  Father gave the goose to Little Sister.  Her\nthanks and Leon's are more than enough for him.  We had great sport.\"\n\n\"I insist on adding mine.  Deep and fervent!\"\n\n\"You take everything so serious.  Can't you see the fun of this?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Laddie.  \"But if you can, I am glad, and I'm thankful for\nanything that gives me a glimpse of you.\"\n\n\"Bye, Little Sister,\" said the Princess, and when she loosened the\nlines the mud flew a rod high.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nKeeping Christmas Our Way\n\n  \"I remember, I remember\n    How my childhood fleeted by,--\n  The mirth of its December,\n    And the warmth of its July.\"\n\n\nWhen dusk closed in it would be Christmas eve.  All day I had three\npoints--a chair beside the kitchen table, a lookout melted through the\nfrost on the front window, and the big sitting-room fireplace.\n\nAll the perfumes of Araby floated from our kitchen that day.  There was\nthat delicious smell of baking flour from big snowy loaves of bread,\nlight biscuit, golden coffee cake, and cinnamon rolls dripping a waxy\nmixture of sugar, butter, and spice, much better than the finest\nbutterscotch ever brought from the city.  There was the tempting odour\nof boiling ham and baking pies.  The air was filled with the smell of\nmore herbs and spices than I knew the names of, that went into\nmincemeat, fruit cake, plum pudding, and pies.  There was a teasing\nfragrance in the spiced vinegar heating for pickles, a reminder of\nwinesap and rambo in the boiling cider, while the newly opened bottles\nof grape juice filled the house with the tang of Concord and muscadine.\nIt seemed to me I never got nicely fixed where I could take a sly dip\nin the cake dough or snipe a fat raisin from the mincemeat but Candace\nwould say:  \"Don't you suppose the backlog is halfway down the lane?\"\n\nThen I hurried to the front window, where I could see through my melted\noutlook on the frosted pane, across the west eighty to the woods, where\nfather and Laddie were getting out the Christmas backlog.  It was too\nbitterly cold to keep me there while they worked, but Laddie said that\nif I would watch, and come to meet them, he would take me up, and I\nmight ride home among the Christmas greens on the log.\n\nSo I flattened my nose against the pane and danced and fidgeted until\nthose odours teased me back to the kitchen; and no more did I get\nnicely located beside a jar of pudding sauce than Candace would object\nto the place I had hung her stocking.  It was my task, my delightful\nall-day task, to hang the stockings.  Father had made me a peg for each\none, and I had ten feet of mantel front along which to arrange them.\nBut it was no small job to do this to every one's satisfaction.  No\nmatter what happened to any one else, Candace had to be pleased: for\ndid not she so manage that most fowls served on mother's table went\ngizzardless to the carving?  She knew and acknowledged the great\nimportance of trying cookies, pies, and cake while they were hot.  She\nwas forever overworked and tired, yet she always found time to make\ngingerbread women with currant buttons on their frocks, and pudgy\ndoughnut men with clove eyes and cigars of cinnamon.  If my own\nstocking lay on the hearth, Candace's had to go in a place that\nsatisfied her--that was one sure thing.  Besides, I had to make up to\nher for what Leon did, because she was crying into the corner of her\napron about that.\n\nHe slipped in and stole her stocking, hung it over the broomstick, and\nmarched around the breakfast table singing to the tune of--\n\n  \"Ha, ha, ha, who wouldn't go--\n    Up on the housetop click, click, click?\n  Down through the chimney,\n    With good Saint Nick----\"\n\nwords he made up himself.  He walked just fast enough that she couldn't\ncatch him, and sang as he went:\n\n  \"Ha, ha, ha, good Saint Nick,\n    Come and look at this stocking, quick!\n\n  If you undertake its length to fill,\n    You'll have to bust a ten-dollar bill.\n  Who does it belong to?  Candace Swartz.\n    Bring extra candy,--seven quarts----\"\n\n\nShe got so angry she just roared, so father made Leon stop it, but I\ncouldn't help laughing myself.  Then we had to pet her all day, so\nshe'd cheer up, and not salt the Christmas dinner with her tears.  I\nnever saw such a monkey as Leon!  I trotted out to comfort her, and\nsnipped bites, until I wore a triangle on the carpet between the\nkitchen and the mantel, the mantel and the window, and the window and\nthe kitchen, while every hour things grew more exciting.\n\nThere never had been such a flurry at our house since I could remember;\nfor to-morrow would be Christmas and bring home all the children, and a\nhouse full of guests.  My big brother, Jerry, who was a lawyer in the\ncity, was coming with his family, and so were Frank, Elizabeth, and\nLucy with theirs, and of course Sally and Peter--I wondered if she\nwould still be fixing his tie--and Shelley came yesterday, blushing\nlike a rose, and she laughed if you pointed your finger at her.\n\nSomething had happened to her in Chicago.  I wasn't so sure as I had\nbeen about a city being such a dreadful place of noise, bad air, and\nwicked people.  Nothing had hurt Shelley.  She had grown so much that\nyou could see she was larger.  Her hair and face--all of Shelley just\nshone.  Her eyes danced, she talked and laughed all the time, and she\nhugged every one who passed her.  She never loved us so before.  Leon\nsaid she must have been homesick and coming back had given her a spell.\nI did hope it would be a bad one, and last forever.  I would have liked\nfor all our family to have had a spell if it would have made them act\nand look like Shelley.  The Princess was not a speck lovelier, and she\ndidn't act any nicer.\n\nIf I could have painted, I'd have made a picture of Shelley with a\ncircle of light above her head like the one of the boy Jesus where He\ntalked with the wise men in the temple.  I asked father if he noticed\nhow much prettier and nicer she was, and he said he did.  Then I asked\nhim if he thought now, that a city was such a bad place to live in, and\nhe said where she was had nothing to do with it, the same thing would\nhappen here, or anywhere, when life's greatest experience came to a\ngirl.  That was all he would say, but figuring it out was easy.  The\ngreatest experience that happened to our girls was when they married,\nlike Sally, so it meant that Shelley had gone and fallen in love with\nthat lawyer man, and she liked sitting on the sofa with him, and no\ndoubt she fixed his ties.  But if any one thought I would tell anything\nI saw when he came they were badly mistaken.\n\nAll of us rushed around like we were crazy.  If father and mother\nhadn't held steady and kept us down, we might have raised the roof.  We\nwere all so glad about getting Leon and the money back; mother hadn't\nbeen sick since the fish cured her; the new blue goose was so like the\none that had burst, even father never noticed any difference; all the\nchildren were either home or coming, and after we had our gifts and the\nbiggest dinner we ever had, Christmas night all of us would go to the\nschoolhouse to see our school try to spell down three others to whom\nthey had sent saucy invitations to come and be beaten.\n\nMother sat in the dining-room beside the kitchen door, so that she\ncould watch the baking, brewing, pickling, and spicing.  It took four\nmen to handle the backlog, which I noticed father pronounced every year\n\"just a little the finest we ever had,\" and Laddie strung the house\nwith bittersweet, evergreens, and the most beautiful sprays of myrtle\nthat he raked from under the snow.  Father drove to town in the sleigh,\nand the list of things to be purchased mother gave him as a reminder\nwas almost a yard long.\n\nThe minute they finished the outdoor work Laddie and Leon began\nbringing in baskets of apples, golden bellflowers, green pippins, white\nwinter pearmains, Rhode Island greenings, and striped rambos all\ncovered with hoarfrost, yet not frozen, and so full of juice you had to\nbite into them carefully or they dripped and offended mother.  These\nthey washed and carried to the cellar ready for use.\n\nThen they cracked big dishes of nuts; and popped corn that popped with\nthe most resounding pops in all my experience--popped a tubful, and\nLaddie melted maple sugar and poured over it and made big balls of\nfluff and sweetness.  He took a pan and filled it with grains, selected\none at a time, the very largest and whitest, and made an especial ball,\nin the middle of which he put a lovely pink candy heart on which was\nprinted in red letters: \"How can this heart be mine, yet yours, unless\nour hearts are one?\"  He wouldn't let any of them see it except me, and\nhe only let me because he knew I'd be delighted.\n\nIt was almost dusk when father came through the kitchen loaded with\nbundles and found Candace and the girls still cooking.\n\nWe were so excited we could scarcely be gathered around the supper\ntable, and mother said we chattered until she couldn't hear herself\nthink.  After a while Laddie laid down his fork and looked at our\nfather.\n\n\"Have you any objection to my using the sleigh to-morrow night?\" he\nasked.\n\nFather looked at mother.\n\n\"Had you planned to use it, mother?\"\n\nMother said:  \"No.  If I go, I'll ride in the big sled with all of us.\nIt is such a little way, and the roads are like glass.\"\n\nSo father said politely, as he always spoke to us:  \"Then it will give\nme great pleasure for you to take it, my son.\"\n\nThat made Leon bang his fork loudly as he dared and squirm in his\nchair, for well he knew that if he had asked, the answer would have\nbeen different.  If Laddie took the sleigh he would harness carefully,\ndrive fast, but reasonably, blanket his horse, come home at the right\ntime, and put everything exactly where he found it.  But Leon would\npitch the harness on some way, race every step, never think of his\nsteaming horse, come home when there was no one so wild as he left to\nplay pranks with, and scatter the harness everywhere.  He knew our\nfather would love to trust him the same as he did Laddie.  He wouldn't\nalways prove himself trustworthy, but he envied Laddie.\n\n\"You think you'll take the Princess to the spelling bee, don't you?\" he\nsneered.\n\n\"I mean to ask her,\" replied Laddie.\n\n\"Maybe you think she'll ride in our old homemade, hickory cheesebox,\nwhen she can sail all over the country like a bird in a velvet-lined\ncutter with a real buffalo robe.\"\n\nThere was a quick catch in mother's breath and I felt her hand on my\nchair tremble.  Father's lips tightened and a frown settled on his\nface, while Laddie fairly jumped.  He went white to the lips, and one\nhand dropped on the table, palm up, the fingers closing and unclosing,\nwhile his eyes turned first to mother, and then to father, in dumb\nappeal.  We all knew that he was suffering.  No one spoke, and Leon\nhaving shot his arrow straight home, saw as people so often do in this\nworld that the damage of unkind words could not easily be repaired; so\nhe grew red in the face and squirmed uncomfortably.\n\nAt last Laddie drew a deep, quivering breath.  \"I never thought of\nthat,\" he said.  \"She has seemed happy to go with me several times when\nI asked her, but of course she might not care to ride in ours, when she\nhas such a fine sleigh of her own.\"\n\nFather's voice fairly boomed down the length of the table.\n\n\"Your mother always has found our sleigh suitable,\" he said.\n\nThe fact was, father was rarely proud of it.  He had selected the\nhickory in our woods, cut it and hauled it to the mill, cured the\nlumber, and used all his spare time for two winters making it.  With\nthe exception of having the runners turned at a factory and iron-bound\nat a smithy, he had completed it alone with great care, even to\nstaining it a beautiful cherry colour, and fitting white sheepskins\ninto the bed.  We had all watched him and been so proud of it, and now\nLeon was sneering at it.  He might just as well have undertaken to\nlaugh at father's wedding suit or to make fun of \"Clark's Commentaries.\"\n\nLaddie appealed to mother:  \"Do you think I'd better not ask her?\"\n\nHe spoke with an effort.\n\n\"Laddie, that is the first time I ever heard you propose to do any one\nan injustice,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't see how,\" said Laddie.\n\n\"It isn't giving the Princess any chance at all,\" replied mother\n\"You've just said that she has seemed pleased to accompany you before,\nnow you are proposing to cut her out of what promises to be the most\ndelightful evening of the winter, without even giving her the chance to\nsay whether she'd go with you or not.  Has she ever made you feel that\nanything you offered her or wanted to do for her was not good enough?\"\n\n\"Never!\" exclaimed Laddie fervently.\n\n\"Until she does, then, do you think it would be quite manly and\nhonourable to make decisions for her?  You say you never thought of\nanything except a pleasant time with her; possibly she feels the same.\nUnless she changes, I would scarcely let a boy's foolish tongue disturb\nher pleasure.  Moreover, as to the matter of wealth, your father may be\nas rich as hers; but they have one, we have many.  If what we spend on\nall our brood could be confined to one child, we could easily duplicate\nall her luxuries, and I think she has the good sense to realize the\nfact as quickly as any one.  I've no doubt she would gladly exchange\nhalf she has for the companionship of a sister or a brother in her\nlonely life.\"\n\nLaddie turned to father, and father's smile was happy again.  Mother\nwas little but she was mighty.  With only a few words she had made Leon\nfeel how unkind and foolish he had been, quieted Laddie's alarm, and\nsoothed the hurt father's pride had felt in that he had not been able\nto furnish her with so fine a turnout as Pryors had.\n\nNext morning when the excitement of gifts and greetings was over, and\nLaddie's morning work was all finished, he took a beautiful volume of\npoems and his popcorn ball and started across the fields due west; all\nof us knew that he was going to call on and offer them to the Princess,\nand ask to take her to the spelling bee.  I suppose Laddie thought he\nwas taking that trip alone, but really he was surrounded.  I watched\nhim from the window, and my heart went with him.  Presently father went\nand sat beside mother's chair, and stroking her hand, whispered softly:\n\"Please don't worry, little mother.  It will be all right.  Your boy\nwill come home happy.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" she answered, \"but I can't help feeling dreadfully\nnervous.  If things go wrong with Laddie, it will spoil the day.\"\n\n\"I have much faith in the Princess' good common sense,\" replied father,\n\"and considering what it means to Laddie, it would hurt me sore to lose\nit.\"\n\nMother sat still, but her lips moved so that I knew she was making soft\nlittle whispered prayers for her best loved son.  But Laddie, plowing\nthrough the drift, never dreamed that all of us were with him.  He was\nalways better looking than any other man I ever had seen, but when, two\nhours later, he stamped into the kitchen he was so much handsomer than\nusual, that I knew from the flush on his cheek and the light in his\neye, that the Princess had been kind, and by the package in his hand,\nthat she had made him a present.  He really had two, a beautiful book\nand a necktie.  I wondered to my soul if she gave him that, so she\ncould fix it!  I didn't believe she had begun on his ties at that time;\nbut of course when he loved her as he did, he wished she would.\n\nIt was the very jolliest Christmas we ever had, but the day seemed\nlong.  When night came we were in a precious bustle.  The wagon bed on\nbobs, filled with hay and covers, drawn by Ned and Jo, was brought up\nfor the family, and the sleigh made spick-and-span and drawn by\nLaddie's thoroughbred, stood beside it.  Laddie had filled the kitchen\noven with bricks and hung up a comfort at four o'clock to keep the\nPrincess warm.\n\nBecause he had to drive out of the way to bring her, Laddie wanted to\nstart early; and when he came down dressed in his college clothes, and\nlooking the manliest of men, some of the folks thought it funny to see\nhim carefully rake his hot bricks from the oven, and pin them in an old\nred breakfast shawl.  I thought it was fine, and I whispered to mother:\n\"Do you suppose that if Laddie ever marries the Princess he will be\ngood to her as he is to you?\"\n\nMother nodded with tear-dimmed eyes, but Shelley said:  \"I'll wager a\nstrong young girl like the Princess will laugh at you for babying over\nher.\"\n\n\"Why?\" inquired Laddie.  \"It is a long drive and a bitter night, and if\nyou fancy the Princess will laugh at anything I do, when I am doing the\nbest I know for her comfort, you are mistaken.  At least, that is the\nimpression she gave me this morning.\"\n\nI saw the swift glance mother shot at father, and father laid down his\npaper and said, while he pretended his glasses needed polishing:  \"Now\nthere is the right sort of a girl for you.  No foolishness about her,\nwhen she has every chance.  Hurrah for the Princess!\"\n\nIt was easy to see that she wasn't going to have nearly so hard a time\nchanging father's opinion as she would mother's.  It was not nearly a\nyear yet, and here he was changed already.  Laddie said good-bye to\nmother--he never forgot--gathered up his comfort and bricks, and\nstarted for Pryors' downright happy.  We went to the schoolhouse a\nlittle later, all of us scoured, curled, starched, and wearing our very\nbest clothes.  My! but it was fine.  There were many lights in the room\nand it was hung with greens.  There was a crowd even though it was\nearly.  On Miss Amelia's table was a volume of history that was the\nprize, and every one was looking and acting the very best he knew how,\nalthough there were cases where they didn't know so very much.\n\nOur Shelley was the handsomest girl there, until the Princess came, and\nthen they both were.  Shelley wore one of her city frocks and a quilted\nred silk hood that was one of her Christmas gifts, and she looked just\nlike a handsome doll.  She made every male creature in that room feel\nthat she was pining for him alone.  May had a gay plaid frock and curls\nnearly a yard long, and so had I, but both our frocks and curls were\nhomemade; mother would have them once in a while; father and I couldn't\nstop her.\n\nBut there was not a soul there who didn't have some sort of gift to\nrejoice over, and laughter and shouts of \"Merry Christmas!\" filled the\nroom.  It was growing late and there was some talk of choosers, when\nthe door opened and in a rush of frosty air the Princess and Laddie\nentered.  Every one stopped short and stared.\n\nThere was good reason.  The Princess looked as if she had accidentally\nstepped from a frame.  She was always lovely and beautifully dressed,\nbut to-night she was prettier and finer than ever before.  You could\nfairly hear their teeth click as some of the most envious of those\ngirls caught sight of her, for she was wearing a new hat!--a black\nvelvet store hat, fitting closely over her crown, with a rim of twisted\nvelvet, a scarlet bird's wing, and a big silver buckle.  Her dress was\nof scarlet cloth cut in forms, and it fitted as if she had been melted\nand poured into it.  It was edged around the throat, wrists, and skirt\nwith narrow bands of fur, and she wore a loose, long, silk-lined coat\nof the same material, and worst of all, furs--furs such as we had heard\nwealthy and stylish city ladies were wearing.  A golden brown cape that\nreached to her elbows, with ends falling to the knees, finished in the\ntails of some animal, and for her hands a muff as big as a nail keg.\n\nNow, there was not a girl in that room, except the Princess, an she had\nthose clothes, who wouldn't have flirted like a peacock, almost\nbursting with pride; but because the Princess had them, and they\ndidn't, they sat stolid and sullen, and cast glances at each other as\nif they were saying:  \"The stuck-up thing!\" \"Thinks she's smart, don't\nshe?\"\n\nMany of them should have gone to meet her and made her welcome, for she\nwas not of our district and really their guest.  Shelley did go, but I\nnoticed she didn't hurry.\n\nThe choosers began at once, and Laddie was the first person called for\nour side, and the Princess for the visitors'.  Every one in the room\nwas chosen on one side or the other; even my name was called, but I\nonly sat still and shook my head, for I very well knew that no one\nexcept father would remember to pronounce easy ones for me, and besides\nI was so bitterly disappointed I could scarcely have stood up.  They\nhad put me in a seat near the fire; the spellers lined either wall, and\na goodly number that refused to spell occupied the middle seats.  I\ncouldn't get a glimpse of Laddie or the home folks, or worst of all, of\nmy idolized Princess.\n\nI never could bear to find a fault with Laddie, but I sadly reflected\nthat he might as well have left me at home, if I were to be buried\nwhere I could neither hear nor see a thing.  I was just wishing it was\nsummer so I could steal out to the cemetery, and have a good visit with\nthe butterflies that always swarmed around Georgiana Jane Titcomb's\ngrave at the corner of the church.  I never knew Georgiana Jane, but\nher people must have been very fond of her, for her grave was scarlet\nwith geraniums, and pink with roses from earliest spring until frost,\nand the bright colours attracted swarms of butterflies.  I had learned\nthat if I stuck a few blossoms in my hair, rubbed some sweet smelling\nones over my hands, and knelt and kept so quiet that I fitted into the\nlandscape, the butterflies would think me a flower too, and alight on\nmy hair, dress, and my hands, even.  God never made anything more\nbeautiful than those butterflies, with their wings of brightly painted\nvelvet down, their bright eyes, their curious antennae, and their\nqueer, tickly feet.  Laddie had promised me a book telling all about\nevery kind there was, the first time he went to a city, so I was\nwishing I had it, and was among my pet beauties with it, when I\ndiscovered him bending over me.\n\nHe took my arm, and marching back to his place, helped me to the deep\nwindow seat beside him, where with my head on a level, and within a\nfoot of his, I could see everything in the whole room.  I don't know\nwhy I ever spent any time pining for the beauties of Georgiana Jane\nTitcomb's grave, even with its handsome headstone on which was carved a\nlamb standing on three feet and holding a banner over its shoulder with\nthe fourth, and the geraniums, roses, and the weeping willow that grew\nover it, thrown in.  I might have trusted Laddie.  He never had\nforgotten me; until he did, I should have kept unwavering faith.\n\nNow, I had the best place of any one in the room, and I smoothed my new\nplaid frock and shook my handmade curls just as near like Shelley as\never I could.  But it seems that most of the ointment in this world has\na fly in it, like in the Bible, for fine as my location was, I soon\nknew that I should ask Laddie to put me down, because the window behind\nme didn't fit its frame, and the night was bitter.  Before half an hour\nI was stiff with cold; but I doubt if I would have given up that\nlocation if I had known I would freeze, because this was the most fun I\nhad ever seen.\n\nMiss Amelia began with McGuffey's spelling book, and whenever some poor\nunfortunate made a bad break the crowd roared with laughter.  Peter\nJustice stood up to spell and before three rounds he was nodding on his\nfeet, so she pronounced \"sleepy\" to him.  Some one nudged Pete and he\nwaked up and spelled it, s-l-e, sle, p-e, pe, and because he really was\nso sleepy it made every one laugh.  James Whittaker spelled compromise\nwith a k, and Isaac Thomas spelled soap, s-o-a-p-e, and it was all the\nfunnier that he couldn't spell it, for from his looks you could tell\nthat he had no acquaintance with it in any shape.  Then Miss Amelia\ngave out \"marriage\" to the spooniest young man in the district, and\n\"stepfather\" to a man who was courting a widow with nine children; and\n\"coquette\" to our Shelley, who had been making sheep's eyes at Johnny\nMyers, so it took her by surprise and she joined the majority, which by\nthat time occupied seats.\n\nThere was much laughing and clapping of hands for a time, but when Miss\nAmelia had let them have their fun and thinned the lines to half a\ndozen on each side who could really spell, she began business, and\npronounced the hardest words she could find in the book, and the\nspellers caught them up and rattled them off like machines.\n\n\"Incompatibility,\" she gave out, and before the sound of her voice died\naway the Princess was spelling:  \"I-n, in, c-o-m, com, in com, p-a-t,\npat, incompat, i, incompati, b-i-l, bil, incompatibil, i,\nincompatibili, t-y, ty, incompatibility.\"\n\nThen Laddie spelled \"incomprehensibility,\" and they finished up the\n\"bilities\" and the \"alities\" with a rush and changed McGuffey's for\nWebster, with five on Laddie's side and three on the Princess', and\nwhen they quit with it, the Princess was alone, and Laddie and our\nlittle May facing her.\n\nFrom that on you could call it real spelling.  They spelled from the\ngrammars, hyperbole, synecdoche, and epizeuxis.  They spelled from the\nphysiology, chlorophyll, coccyx, arytenoid, and the names of the bones\nand nerves, and all the hard words inside you.\n\nThey tried the diseases and spelled jaundice, neurasthenia, and\ntongue-tied.  They tried all the occupations and professions, and went\nthrough the stores and spelled all sorts of hardware, china and dry\ngoods.  Each side kept cheering its own and urging them to do their\nbest, and every few minutes some man in the back of the house said\nsomething that was too funny.  When Miss Amelia pronounced \"bombazine\"\nto Laddie our side cried, \"Careful, Laddie, careful! you're out of your\nelement!\"\n\nAnd when she gave \"swivel-tree\" to the Princess, her side whispered,\n\"Go easy!  Do you know what it is?  Make her define it.\"\n\nThey branched over the country.  May met her Jonah on the mountains.\nKatahdin was too much for her, and Laddie and the Princess were left to\nfight it out alone.  I didn't think Laddie liked it.  I'm sure he never\nexpected it to turn out that way.  He must have been certain he could\nbeat her, for after he finished English there were two or three other\nlanguages he knew, and every one in the district felt that he could\nwin, and expected him to do it.  It was an awful place to put him in, I\ncould see that.  He stood a little more erect than usual, with his eyes\ntoward the Princess, and when his side kept crying, \"Keep the prize,\nLaddie!  Hold up the glory of the district!\" he ground out the words as\nif he had a spite at them for not being so hard that he would have an\nexcuse for going down.\n\nThe Princess was poised lightly on her feet, her thick curls, just\ntouching her shoulders, shining in the light; her eyes like stars, her\nperfect, dark oval face flushed a rich red, and her deep bosom rising\nand falling with excitement.  Many times in later years I have tried to\nremember when the Princess was loveliest of all, and that night always\nstands first.\n\nI was thinking fast.  Laddie was a big man.  Men were strong on purpose\nso they could bear things.  He loved the Princess so, and he didn't\nknow whether she loved him or not; and every marriageable man in three\ncounties was just aching for the chance to court her, and I didn't feel\nthat he dared risk hurting her feelings.\n\nLaddie said, to be the man who conquered the Princess and to whom she\nlifted her lips for a first kiss was worth life itself.  I made up my\nmind that night that he knew just exactly what he was talking about.  I\nthought so too.  And I seemed to understand why Laddie--Laddie in his\nyouth, strength, and manly beauty, Laddie, who boasted that there was\nnot a nerve in his body--trembled before the Princess.\n\nIt looked as if she had set herself against him and was working for the\nhonours, and if she wanted them, I didn't feel that he should chance\nbeating her, and then, too, it was beginning to be plain that it was\nnone too sure he could.  Laddie didn't seem to be the only one who had\nbeen well drilled in spelling.\n\nI held my jaws set a minute, so that I could speak without Laddie\nknowing how I was shivering, and then I whispered:  \"Except her eyes\nare softer, she looks just like a cardinal.\"\n\nLaddie nodded emphatically and moving a step nearer laid his elbow\nacross my knees.  Heavens, how they spelled!  They finished all the\nwords I ever heard and spelled like lightning through a lot of others\nthe meaning of which I couldn't imagine.  Father never gave them out at\nhome.  They spelled epiphany, gaberdine, ichthyology, gewgaw,\nkaleidoscope, and troubadour.  Then Laddie spelled one word two\ndifferent ways; and the Princess went him one better, for she spelled\nanother three.\n\nThey spelled from the Bible, Nebuchadnezzar, Potiphar, Peleg,\nBelshazzar, Abimelech, and a host of others I never heard the minister\npreach about.  Then they did the most dreadful thing of all.  \"Broom,\"\npronounced the teacher, and I began mentally, b-r-o-o-m, but Laddie\nspelled \"b-r-o-u-g-h-a-m,\" and I stared at him in a daze.  A second\nlater Miss Amelia gave out \"Beecham\" to the Princess, and again I tried\nit, b-e-e-c-h, but the Princess was spelling \"B-e-a-u-c-h-a-m-p,\" and I\nalmost fell from the window.\n\nThey kept that up until I was nearly crazy with nervousness; I forgot I\nwas half frozen.  I pulled Laddie's sleeve and whispered in his ear:\n\"Do you think she'll cry if you beat her?\"\n\nI was half crying myself, the strain had been awful.  I was torn\nbetween these dearest loves of mine.\n\n\"Seen me have any chance to beat her?\" retorted Laddie.\n\nMiss Amelia seemed to have used most of her books, and at last picked\nup an old geography and began giving out points around the coast, while\nLaddie and the Princess took turns snatching the words from her mouth\nand spelling them.  Father often did that, so Laddie was safe there.\nThey were just going it when Miss Amelia pronounced, \"Terra del Fuego,\"\nto the Princess.  \"T-e-r-r-a, Terra, d-e-l, del, F-i-e-u-g-o,\" spelled\nthe Princess, and sat down suddenly in the midst of a mighty groan from\nher side, swelled by a wail from one little home district deserter.\n\n\"Next!\" called Miss Amelia.\n\n\"T-e-r-r-a, Terra, d-e-l, del, F-e-u-g-o,\" spelled Laddie.\n\n\"Wrong!\" wailed Miss Amelia, and our side breathed one big groan in\nconcert, and I lifted up my voice in that also.  Then every one laughed\nand pretended they didn't care, and the Princess came over and shook\nhands with Laddie, and Laddie said to Miss Amelia:\n\n\"Just let me take that book a minute until I see how the thing really\ndoes go.\"  It was well done and satisfied the crowd, which clapped and\ncheered; but as I had heard him spell it many, many times for father,\nhe didn't fool me.\n\nLaddie and the Princess drew slips for the book and it fell to her.  He\nwas so pleased he kissed me as he lifted me down and never noticed I\nwas so stiff I could scarcely stand--and I did fall twice going to the\nsleigh.  My bed was warm and my room was warm, but I chilled the night\nthrough and until the next afternoon, when I grew so faint and sleepy I\ncrept to Miss Amelia's desk, half dead with fright--it was my first\ntrip to ask an excuse--and begged:  \"Oh teacher, I'm so sick.  Please\nlet me go home.\"\n\nI think one glance must have satisfied her that it was true, for she\nsaid very kindly that I might, and she would send Leon along to take\ncare of me.  But my troubles were only half over when I had her\nconsent.  It was very probable I would be called a baby and sent back\nwhen I reached home, so I refused company and started alone.  It seemed\na mile past the cemetery.  I was so tired I stopped, and leaning\nagainst the fence, peeped through at the white stones and the whiter\nmounds they covered, and wondered how my mother would feel if she were\ncompelled to lay me beside the two little whooping cough and fever\nsisters already sleeping there.  I decided that it would be so very\ndreadful, that the tears began to roll down my cheeks and freeze before\nthey fell.\n\nDown the Big Hill slowly I went.  How bare it looked then!  Only\nleafless trees and dried seed pods rattling on the bushes, the sand\nfrozen, and not a rush to be seen for the thick blanket of snow.  A few\nrods above the bridge was a footpath, smooth and well worn, that led\ndown to the creek, beaten by the feet of children who raced it every\nday and took a running slide across the ice.  I struck into the path as\nalways; but I was too stiff to run, for I tried.  I walked on the ice,\nand being almost worn out, sat on the bridge and fell to watching the\nwater bubbling under the glassy crust.  I was so dull a horse's feet\nstruck the bridge before I heard the bells--for I had bells in my ears\nthat day--and when I looked up it was the Princess--the Princess in her\nred dress and furs, with a silk hood instead of her hat, her sleigh\nlike a picture, with a buffalo robe, that it was whispered about the\ncountry, cost over a hundred dollars, and her thoroughbred mare Maud\ndancing and prancing.  \"Bless me!  Is it you, Little Sister?\" she\nasked.  \"Shall I give you a ride home?\"\n\nBefore I could scarcely realize she was there, I was beside her and she\nwas tucking the fine warm robe over me.  I lifted a pair of dull eyes\nto her face.\n\n\"Oh Princess, I am so glad you came,\" I said.  \"I don't think I could\nhave gone another step if I had frozen on the bridge.\"\n\nThe Princess bent to look in my face.  \"Why, you poor child!\" She\nexclaimed, \"you're white as death!  Where are you ill?\"\n\nI leaned on her shoulder, though ordinarily I would not have offered to\ntouch her first, and murmured:  \"I am not ill, outdoors, only dull,\nsleepy, and freezing with the cold.\"\n\n\"It was that window!\" she exclaimed.  \"I thought of it, but I trusted\nLaddie.\"\n\nThat roused me a little.\n\n\"Oh Princess,\" I cried, \"you mustn't blame Laddie!  I knew it was too\ncold, but I wouldn't tell him, because if he put me down I couldn't see\nyou, and we thought, but for your eyes being softer, you looked just\nlike a cardinal.\"\n\nThe Princess hugged me close and laughed merrily.  \"You darling!\" she\ncried.\n\nThen she shook me up sharply:  \"Don't you dare go to sleep!\" she said.\n\"I must take you home first.\"\n\nOnce there she quieted my mother's alarm, put me to bed, drove three\nmiles for Dr. Fenner and had me started nicely on the road to a month\nof lung fever, before she left.  In my delirium I spelled volumes; and\nthe miracle of it was I never missed a word until I came to \"Terra del\nFuego,\" and there I covered my lips and stoutly insisted that it was\nthe Princess' secret.\n\nTo keep me from that danger sleep on the road, she shook me up and\nasked about the spelling bee.  I thought it was the grandest thing I\nhad ever seen in my life, and I told her so.  She gathered me close and\nwhispered:  \"Tell me something, Little Sister, please.\"\n\nThe minx!  She knew I thought that a far finer title than hers.\n\n\"Would Laddie care?\" I questioned.\n\n\"Not in the least!\"\n\n\"Well then, I will.\"\n\n\"Can Laddie spell 'Terra del Fuego?'\" she whispered.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"I have heard him do it over and over for father.\"\n\nThe Princess forgot I was so sick, forgot her horse, forgot everything.\nShe threw her head back and her hands up, until her horse stopped in\nanswer to the loosened line, and she laughed and laughed.  She laughed\nuntil peal on peal re-echoed from our Big Woods clear across the west\neighty.  She laughed until her ringing notes set my slow pulses on\nfire, and started my numbed brain in one last effort.  I stood up and\ntook her lovely face between my palms, turning it until I could see\nwhether the thought that had come to me showed in her eyes, and it did.\n\n\"Oh you darling, splendid Princess!\" I cried.  \"You missed it on\npurpose to let Laddie beat!  You can spell it too!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Horn of the Hunter\n\n  \"The dusky night rides down the sky,\n    And ushers in the morn:\n  The hounds all join in glorious cry,\n    The huntsman winds his horn.\"\n\n\nLeon said our house reminded him of the mourners' bench before any one\nhad \"come through.\"  He said it was so deadly with Sally and Shelley\naway, that he had a big notion to marry Susie Fall and bring her over\nto liven things up a little.  Mother said she thought that would be a\ngood idea, and Leon started in the direction of Falls', but he only\nwent as far as Deams'.  When he came back he had a great story to tell\nabout dogs chasing their sheep, and foxes taking their geese.  Father\nsaid sheep were only safe behind securely closed doors, especially in\nwinter, and geese also.  Leon said every one hadn't as big a barn as\nours, and father said there was nothing to prevent any man from\nbuilding the sized barn he needed to shelter his creatures in safety\nand comfort, if he wanted to dig in and earn the money to put it up.\nThere was no answer to that, and Mr. Leon didn't try to make any.\nMostly, he said something to keep on talking, but sometimes he saw when\nhe had better quit.\n\nI was having a good time, myself.  Of course when the fever was the\nworst, and when I never had been sick before, it was pretty bad, but as\nsoon as I could breathe all right, there was no pain to speak of, and\nevery one was so good to me.  I could have Bobby on the footboard of my\nbed as long as I wanted him, and he would crow whenever I told him to.\nI kept Grace Greenwood beside me, and spoiled her dress making her take\nsome of each dose of medicine I did, but Shelley wrote that she was\nsaving goods and she would make her another as soon as she came home.\nI made mother put red flannel on Grace's chest and around her neck,\nuntil I could hardly find her mouth when she had to take her medicine,\nbut she swallowed it down all right, or she got her nose held, until\nshe did.  She was not nearly so sick as I was, though.  We both grew\nbetter together, and, when Dr. Fenner brought me candy, she had her\nshare.\n\nWhen I began to get well it was lovely.  Such toast, chicken broth, and\nsquirrels, as mother always had.  I even got the chicken liver,\noranges, and all of them gave me everything they had that I wanted--I\nmust almost have died to make them act like that!\n\nLaddie and father would take me up wrapped in blankets and hold me to\nrest my back.  Father would rock me and sing about \"Young Johnny,\" just\nas he had when I was little.  We always laughed at it, we knew it was a\nfool song, but we liked it.  The tune was smooth and sleepy-like and\nthe words went:\n\n  \"One day young Johnny, he did go,\n   Way down in the meadow for to mow.\n     Li-tu-di-nan-incty, tu-di-nan-incty, noddy O!\n\n   He scarce had mowed twice round the field,\n   When a pesky sarpent bit him on the heel,\n     Li-tu-di-nan-incty, tu-di-nan-incty, noddy O!\n\n   He threw the scythe upon the ground,\n   An' shut his eyes, and looked all round,\n     Li-tu-di-nan-incty, tu-di-nan-incty, noddy O!\n\n   He took the sarpent in his hand,\n   And then ran home to Molly Bland,\n     Li-tu-di-nan-incty, tu-di-nan-incty, noddy O!\n\n   O Molly dear, and don't you see,\n   This pesky sarpent that bit me?\n     Li-tu-di-nan-incty, tu-di-nan-incty, noddy O!\n\n   O Johnny dear, why did you go,\n   Way down in the meadow fot to mow?\n     Li-tu-di-nan-incty, tu-di-nan-incty, noddy O!\n\n   O Molly dear, I thought you knowed\n   'Twas daddy's grass, and it must be mowed,\n     Li-tu-di-nan-incty, tu-di-n an-incty, noddy O!\n\n   Now all young men a warning take,\n   And don't get bit by a rattlesnake.\n     Li-tu-di-nan-incty, tu-di-nan-incty, noddy O!\"\n\n\nAll of them told me stories, read to me, and Frank, one of my big\ngone-away brothers, sent me the prettiest little book.  It had a green\ncover with gold on the back, and it was full of stories and poems, not\nso very hard, because I could read every one of them, with help on a\nfew words.  The piece I liked best was poetry.  If it hadn't been for\nthat, I'm afraid, I was having such a good time, I'd have lain there\nuntil I forgot how to walk, with all of them trying to see who could be\nnicest to me.  The ones who really could, were Laddie and the Princess,\nexcept mother.  Laddie lifted me most carefully, the Princess told the\nbest stories, but after all, if the burning and choking grew so bad I\ncould scarcely stand it, mother could lay her hand on my head and say,\n\"Poor child,\" in a way that made me work to keep on breathing.  Maybe I\nonly THOUGHT I loved Laddie best.  I guess if I had been forced to take\nmy choice when I had the fever, I'd have stuck pretty tight to mother.\nEven Dr. Fenner said if I pulled through she'd have to make me.  I\nmight have been lying there yet, if it hadn't been for the book Frank\nsent me, with the poetry piece in it.  It began:\n\n  \"Somewhere on a sunny bank, buttercups are bright,\n  Somewhere 'mid the frozen grass, peeps the daisy white.\"\n\n\nI read that so often I could repeat it quite as well with the book shut\nas open, and every time I read it, I wanted outdoors worse.  In one\nplace it ran:\n\n  \"Welcome, yellow buttercups, welcome daisies white,\n  Ye are in my spirit visioned a delight.\n  Coming in the springtime of sunny hours to tell,\n  Speaking to our hearts of Him who doeth all things well.\"\n\n\nThat piece helped me out of bed, and the blue gander screaming opened\nthe door.  It was funny about it too.  I don't know WHY it worked on me\nthat way; it just kept singing in my heart all day, and I could shut my\neyes and go to sleep seeing buttercups in a gold sheet all over our Big\nHill, although there never was a single one there; and meadows full of\ndaisies, which were things father said were a pest he couldn't\ntolerate, because they spread so, and he grubbed up every one he found.\nYet that piece filled our meadow until I imagined I could roll on\ndaisies.  They might be a pest to farmers, but sheets of them were\npretty good if you were burning with fever.  Between the buttercups and\nthe daisies I left the bed with a light head and wobbly legs.\n\nOf course I wasn't an idiot.  I knew when I looked from our south\nwindow exactly what was to be seen.  The person who wrote that piece\nwas the idiot.  It sang and sounded pretty, and it pulled you up and\npushed you out, but really it was a fool thing, as I very well knew.  I\ncouldn't imagine daisies peeping through frozen grass.  Any baby should\nhave known they bloomed in July.  Skunk cabbage always came first, and\nhepatica.  If I had looked from any of our windows and seen daisies and\nbuttercups in March, I'd have fallen over with the shock.  I knew there\nwould be frozen brown earth, last year's dead leaves, caved-in apple\nand potato holes, the cabbage row almost gone, puddles of water and mud\neverywhere, and I would hear geese scream and hens sing.  And yet that\npoem kept pulling and pulling, and I was happy as a queen--I wondered\nif they were for sure; mother had doubts--the day I was wrapped in\nshawls and might sit an hour in the sun on the top board of the back\nfence, where I could see the barn, orchard, the creek and the meadow,\nas you never could in summer because of the leaves.  I wasn't looking\nfor buttercups and daisies either.  I mighty well knew there wouldn't\nbe any.\n\nBut the sun was there.  A little taste of willow, oak and maple was in\nthe air.  You could see the buds growing fat too, and you could smell\nthem.  If you opened your eyes and looked in any direction you could\nsee blue sky, big, ragged white clouds, bare trees, muddy earth with\ngrassy patches, and white spots on the shady sides where unmelted snow\nmade the icy feel in the air, even when the sun shone.  You couldn't\nhear yourself think for the clatter of the turkeys, ganders, roosters,\nhens, and everything that had a voice.  I was so crazy with it I could\nscarcely hang to the fence; I wanted to get down and scrape my wings\nlike the gobbler, and scream louder than the gander, and crow oftener\nthan the rooster.  There was everything all ice and mud.  They would\nhave frozen, if they hadn't been put in a house at night, and starved,\nif they hadn't been fed; they were not at the place where they could\nhunt and scratch, and not pay any attention to feeding time, because of\nbeing so bursting full.  They had no nests and babies to rejoice over.\nBut there they were!  And so was I!  Buttercups and daisies be-hanged!\nIce and mud really!  But if you breathed that air, and shut your eyes,\nnorth, you could see blue flags, scarlet lilies, buttercups, cattails\nand redbirds sailing over them; east, there would be apple bloom and\nsoft grass, cowslips, and bubbling water, robins, thrushes, and\nbluebirds; and south, waving corn with wild rose and alder borders, and\nsparrows, and larks on every fence rider.\n\nRight there I got that daisy thing figured out.  It wasn't that there\nwere or ever would be daisies and buttercups among the frozen grass;\nbut it was forever and always that when this FEEL came into the air,\nyou knew they were COMING.  THAT was what ailed the gander and the\ngobbler.  They hadn't a thing to be thankful for yet, but something\ninside them was swelling and pushing because of what was coming.  I\nfelt exactly as they did, because I wanted to act the same way, but I'd\nbeen sick enough to know that I'd better be thankful for the chance to\nsit on the fence, and think about buttercups and daisies.  Really, one\nold brown and purple skunk cabbage with a half-frozen bee buzzing over\nit, or a few forlorn little spring beauties, would have set me wild,\nand when a lark really did go over, away up high, and a dove began to\ncoo in the orchard, if Laddie hadn't come for me, I would have fallen\nfrom the fence.\n\nI simply had to get well and quickly too, for the wonderful time was\nbeginning.  It was all very well to lie in bed when there was nothing\nelse to do, and every one would pet me and give me things; but here was\nmaple syrup time right at the door, and the sugar camp most fun alive;\nhere was all the neighbourhood crazy mad at the foxes, and planning a\ngreat chase covering a circuit of miles before the ground thawed; here\nwas Easter and all the children coming, except Shelley--again, it would\ncost too much for only one day--and with everything beginning to hum, I\nfound out there would be more amusement outdoors than inside.  That was\nhow I came to study out the daisy piece.  There was nothing in the\nsilly, untrue lines: the pull and tug was in what they made you think\nof.\n\nI was still so weak I had to take a nap every day, so I wasn't sleepy\nas early at night, and I heard father and mother talk over a lot of\nthings before they went to bed.  After they mentioned it, I remembered\nthat we hadn't received nearly so many letters from Shelley lately, and\nmother seldom found time to read them aloud during the day and forgot,\nor her eyes were tired, at night.\n\n\"Are you worrying about Shelley?\" asked father one night.\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" answered mother.\n\n\"What do you think is the trouble?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid things are not coming out with Mr. Paget as she hoped.\"\n\n\"If they don't, she is going to be unhappy?\"\n\n\"That's putting it mildly.\"\n\n\"Well, I was doubtful in the beginning.\"\n\n\"Now hold on,\" said mother.  \"So was I; but what are you going to do?\nI can't go through the world with my girls, and meet men for them.  I\ntrained them just as carefully as possible before I started them out;\nthat was all I could do.  Shelley knows when a man appears clean,\ndecent and likable.  She knows when his calling is respectable.  She\nknows when his speech is proper, his manners correct, and his ways\nattractive.  She found this man all of these things, and she liked him\naccordingly.  At Christmas she told me about it freely.\"\n\n\"Have you any idea how far the thing has gone?\"\n\n\"She said then that she had seen him twice a week for two months.  He\nseemed very fond of her.  He had told her he cared more for her than\nany girl he ever had met, and he had asked her to come here this summer\nand pay us a visit, so she wanted to know if he might.\"\n\n\"Of course you told her yes.\"\n\n\"Certainly I told her yes.  I wish now we'd saved money and you'd gone\nto visit her and met him when she first wrote of him.  You could have\nfound out who and what he was, and with your experience you might have\npointed out signs that would have helped her to see, before it was too\nlate.\"\n\n\"What do you think is the trouble?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew!  She simply is failing to mention him in her letters;\nall the joy of living has dropped from them, she merely writes about\nher work; and now she is beginning to complain of homesickness and to\nsay that she doesn't know how to endure the city any longer.  There's\nsomething wrong.\"\n\n\"Had I better go now?\"\n\n\"Too late!\" said mother, and I could hear her throat go wrong and the\nchoke come into her voice.  \"She is deeply in love with him; he hasn't\nfound in her what he desires; probably he is not coming any more; what\ncould you do?\"\n\n\"I could go and see if there is anything I could do?\"\n\n\"She may not want you.  I'll write her to-morrow and suggest that you\nor Laddie pay her a visit and learn what she thinks.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said father.\n\nHe kissed her and went to sleep, but mother was awake yet, and she got\nup and stood looking down at the church and the two little white\ngravestones she could see from her window, until I thought she would\nfreeze, and she did nearly, for her hands were cold and the tears\nfalling when she examined my covers, and felt my face and hands before\nshe went to bed.  My, but the mother of a family like ours is never\nshort of a lot of things to think of!\n\nI had a new one myself.  Now what do you suppose there was about that\nman?\n\nOf course after having lived all her life with father and Laddie,\nShelley would know how a man should look, and act to be right; and this\none must have been right to make her bloom out in winter the way other\nthings do in spring; and now what could be wrong?  Maybe city girls\nwere prettier than Shelley.  But all women were made alike on the\noutside, and that was as far as you could see.  You couldn't find out\nwhether they had pure blood, true hearts, or clean souls.  No girl\ncould be so very much prettier than Shelley; they simply were not made\nthat way.  She knew how to behave; she had it beaten into her, like all\nof us.  And she knew her books, what our schools could teach her, and\nGroveville, and Lucy, who had city chances for years, and there never\nwas a day at our house when books and papers were not read and\ndiscussed, and your spelling was hammered into you standing in rows\nagainst the wall, and memory tests--what on earth could be the matter\nwith Shelley that a man who could make her look and act as she did at\nChristmas, would now make her unhappy?  Sometimes I wanted to be grown\nup dreadfully, and again, times like that, I wished my bed could stay\nin mother's room, and I could creep behind father's paper and go to\nsleep between his coat and vest, and have him warm my feet in his hands\nforever.\n\nThis world was too much for me.  I never worked and worried in all my\nlife as I had over Laddie and the Princess, and Laddie said I, myself,\nnever would know how I had helped him.  Of course nothing was settled;\nhe had to try to make her love him by teaching her how lovable he was.\nWe knew, because we always had known him, but she was a stranger and\nhad to learn.  It was mighty fine for him that he could force his way\npast the dogs, Thomas, the other men, her half-crazy father, and\nthrough the locked door, and go there to try to make her see, on Sunday\nnights, and week days, every single chance he could invent, and he\ncould think up more reasons for going to Pryors' than mother could for\nputting out an extra wash.\n\nNow just as I got settled a little about him, and we could see they\nreally wanted him there, at least the Princess and her mother did, and\nMr. Pryor must have been fairly decent or Laddie never would have gone;\nand the Princess came to our house to bring me things to eat, and ask\nhow mother was, and once to learn how she embroidered Sally's wedding\nchemise, and social things like that; and when father acted as if he\nliked her so much he hadn't a word to say, and mother seemed to begin\nto feel as if Laddie and the Princess could be trusted to fix it up\nabout God; and the old mystery didn't matter after all; why, here\nShelley popped up with another mystery, and it belonged to us.  But\nwhatever ailed that man I couldn't possibly think.  It had got to be\nhim, for Shelley was so all right at Christmas, it made her look that\npretty we hardly knew her.\n\nI was thinking about her until I scarcely could study my lessons, so I\ncould recite to Laddie at night, and not fall so far behind at school.\nMiss Amelia offered to hear me, but I just begged Laddie, and father\ncould see that he taught me fifty things in a lesson that you could\ntell to look at Miss Amelia, she never knew.  Why, he couldn't hear me\nread:\n\n  \"We charged upon a flock of geese,\n    And put them all to flight\n  Except one sturdy gander\n    That thought to show us fight,\"--\n\nwithout teaching me that the oldest picture in all the world was made\nof a row of geese, some of which were kinds we then had--the earth\ndidn't seem so old when you thought of that--and how a flock of geese\nonce wakened an army and saved a city, and how far wild geese could fly\nwithout alighting in migration, and everything you could think of about\ngeese, only he didn't know why eating the same grass made feathers on\ngeese and wool on sheep.  Anyway, Miss Amelia never told you a word but\nwhat was in the book, and how to read and spell it.  May said that\nfather was very much disappointed in her, and he was never going to\nhire another teacher until he met and talked with her, no matter what\nkind of letters she could send.  He was not going to help her get a\nsummer school, and O my soul!  I hope no one does, for if they do, I\nhave to go, and I'd rather die than go to school in the summer.\n\nLeon came in about that time with more fox stories.  Been in Jacob\nHood's chicken house and taken his best Dorking rooster, and father\nsaid it was time to do something.  He never said a word so long as they\ntook Deams', except they should have barn room for their geese, but\nwhen anything was the matter at Hoods' father and mother started doing\nsomething the instant they heard of it.  So father and Laddie rode\naround the neighbourhood and talked it over, and the next night they\nhad a meeting at our schoolhouse; men for miles came, and they planned\na regular old-fashioned foxchase, and every one was wild about it.\n\nLaddie told it at Pryors' and the Princess wanted to go; she asked to\ngo with him, and if you please, Mr. Pryor wanted to go too, and their\nThomas.  They attended the meeting to tell how people chase foxes in\nEngland, where they seem to hunt them most of the time.  Father said:\n\"Thank God for even a foxchase, if it will bring Mr. Pryor among his\nneighbours and help him to act sensibly.\"  They are going away fifteen\nmiles or farther, and form a big circle of men from all directions,\nsome walking in a line, and others riding to bring back any foxes that\nescape, and with dogs, and guns, they are going to rout out every one\nthey can find, and kill them so they won't take the geese, little pigs,\nlambs, and Hoods' Dorking rooster.  Laddie had a horn that Mr. Pryor\ngave him when he told him this country was showing signs of becoming\ncivilized at last; but Leon grinned and said he'd beat that.\n\nThen when you wanted him, he was in the wood house loft at work, but\nfather said he couldn't get into mischief there.  He should have seen\nthat churn when it was full of wedding breakfast!  We ate for a week\nafterward, until things were all moulded, and we didn't dare anymore.\nOne night I begged so hard and promised so faithfully he trusted me; he\ndid often, after I didn't tell about the Station; and I went to the\nloft with him, and watched him work an hour.  He had a hollow limb\nabout six inches through and fourteen long.  He had cut and burned it\nto a mere shell, and then he had scraped it with glass inside and out,\nuntil it shone like polished horn.  He had shaved the wool from a piece\nof sheepskin, soaked, stretched, and dried it, and then fitted it over\none end of the drumlike thing he had made, and tacked and bound it in a\nlittle groove at the edge.  He put the skin on damp so he could stretch\nit tight.  Then he punched a tiny hole in the middle, and pulled\nthrough it, down inside the drum, a sheepskin thong rolled in resin,\nwith a knot big enough to hold it, and not tear the head.  Then he took\nit under his arm and we slipped across the orchard below the Station,\nand went into the hollow and tried it.\n\nIt worked!  I almost fell dead with the first frightful sound.  It just\nbellowed and roared.  In only a little while he found different ways to\nmake it sound by his manner of working the tongue.  A long, steady,\neven pull got that kind of a roar.  A short, quick one made it bark.  A\npull half the length of the thong, a pause, and another pull, made it\nsound like a bark and a yelp.  To pull hard and quick, made it go\nlouder, and soft and easy made it whine.  Before he had tried it ten\nminutes he could do fifty things with it that would almost scare the\nlivers out of those nasty old foxes that were taking every one's geese,\nDorking roosters, and even baby lambs and pigs.  Of course people\ncouldn't stand that; something had to be done!\n\nEven in the Bible it says, \"Beware of the little foxes that spoil the\nvines,\" and geese, especially blue ones, Dorking roosters, lambs, and\npigs were much more valuable than mere vines; so Leon made that awful\nthing to scare the foxes from their holes that's in the Bible too,\nabout the holes I mean, not the scaring.  I wanted Leon to slip to the\nback door and make the dumb-bell--that's what he called it; if I had\nbeen naming it I would have called it the thunder-bell--go; but he\nwouldn't.  He said he didn't propose to work as he had, and then have\nsome one find out, and fix one like it.  He said he wouldn't let it\nmake a sound until the night before the chase, and then he'd raise the\ndead.  I don't know about the dead; but it was true of the living.\nFather went a foot above his chair and cried: \"Whoo-pee!\"  All of us,\neven I, when I was waiting for it, screamed as if Paddy Ryan raved at\nthe door.  Then Leon came in and showed us, and every one wanted to\nwork the dumb-bell, even mother.  Leon marched around and showed off;\nhe looked \"See the conquering hero comes,\" all over.  I never felt\nworse about being made into a girl than I did that night.\n\nI couldn't sleep for excitement, and mother said I might as well, for\nit would be at least one o'clock before they would round-up in our\nmeadow below the barn.  All the neighbours were to shut up their stock,\ntie their dogs, or lead them with chains, if they took them, so when\nthe foxes were surrounded, they could catch them alive, and save their\nskins.  I wondered how some of those chasing people, even Laddie, Leon,\nand father--think of that!  father was going too--I wondered how they\nwould have liked to have had something as much bigger than they were,\nas they were bigger than the foxes, chase them with awful noises, guns\nand dogs, and catch them alive--to save their skins.  No wonder I\ncouldn't sleep!  I guess the foxes wouldn't either, if they had known\nwhat was coming.  Maybe hereafter the mean old things would eat rabbits\nand weasels, and leave the Dorking roosters alone.\n\nMay, Candace, and Miss Amelia were going to Deams' to wait, and when\nthe round-up formed a solid line, they planned to stand outside, and\nsee the sport.  If they had been the foxes, maybe they wouldn't have\nthought it was so funny; but of course, people just couldn't have even\ntheir pigs and lambs taken.  We had to have wool to spin yarn for our\nstockings, weave our blankets and coverlids, and our Sunday winter\ndresses of white flannel with narrow black crossbars were from the\nbacks of our own sheep, and we had to have ham to fry with eggs, and\nboil for Sunday night suppers, and bacon to cook the greens with--of\ncourse it was all right.\n\nBefore it was near daylight I heard Laddie making the kitchen fire, so\nfather got right up, Leon came down, and all of them went to the barn\nto do the feeding.  I wanted to get up too, but mother said I should\nstay in bed until the house was warm, because if I took more cold I'd\nbe sick again.  At breakfast May asked father about when they should\nstart for Deams' to be ahead of the chase, and he said by ten o'clock\nat least; because a fox driven mad by pursuit, dogs, and noise, was a\nvery dangerous thing, and a bite might make hy----the same thing as a\nmad dog.  He said our back barn door opening from the threshing floor\nwould afford a fine view of the meet, but Candace, May, and Miss Amelia\nwanted to be closer.  I might go with them if they would take good care\nof me, and they promised to; but when the time came to start, there was\nsuch a queer feeling inside me, I thought maybe it was more fever, and\nwith mother would be the best place for me, so I said I wanted to watch\nfrom the barn.  Father thought that was a capital idea, because I would\nbe on the east side, where there would be no sun and wind, and it would\nbe perfectly safe; also, I really could see what was going on better\nfrom that height than on the ground.\n\nThe sun was going to shine, but it hadn't peeped above Deams'\nstrawstack when father on his best saddle horse, and Laddie on Flos,\nrode away, their eyes shining, their faces red, their blood pounding so\nit made their voices sound excited and different.  Leon was to go on\nfoot.  Father said he would ride a horse to death.  He just grinned and\nnever made a word of complaint.  Seemed funny for him.\n\n\"I was over having a little confidential chat with my horse, last\nnight,\" he said, \"and next year we'll be in the chase, and we'll show\nyou how to take fences, and cut curves; just you wait!\"\n\n\"Leon, DON'T build so on that horse,\" wailed mother.  \"I'm sure that\nmoney was stolen like ours, and the owner will claim it! I feel it in\nmy bones!\"\n\n\"Aw, shucks!\" said Leon.  \"That money is mine.  He won't either!\"\n\nWhen they started, father took Leon behind him to ride as far as the\ncounty line.  He said he would go slowly, and it wouldn't hurt the\nhorse, but Leon slipped off at Hoods', and said he'd go with their\nboys, so father let him, because light as Leon was, both of them were\nquite a load for one horse.  Laddie went to ride with the Princess.  We\ncould see people moving around in Pryors' barnyard when our men\nstarted.  Candace washed, Miss Amelia wiped the dishes, May swept, and\nall of them made the beds, and then they went to Deams', while I stayed\nwith mother.  When she thought it was time, she bundled me up warmly,\nand I went to the barn.  Father had the east doors standing open for\nme, so I could sit in the sun, hang my feet against the warm boards,\nand see every inch of our meadow where the meet was to be.  I was\nreally too warm there, and had to take off the scarf, untie my hood,\nand unbutton my coat.\n\nIt was a trifle muddy, but the frost had not left the ground yet, the\nsparrows were singing fit to burst, so were the hens.  I didn't care\nmuch for the music of the hen, but I could see she meant well.  She\nliked her nest quite as much as the red velvet bird with black wings,\nor the bubbly yellow one, and as for baby chickens, from the first peep\nthey beat a little naked, blind, wobbly tree bird, so any hen had a\nright to sing for joy because she was going to be the mother of a large\nfamily of them.  A hen had something was going to be the mother of a\nlarge family of them.  A hen had something to sing about all right, and\nso had we, when we thought of poached eggs and fried chicken.  When I\nremembered them, I saw that it was no wonder the useful hen warbled so\nproudlike; but that was all nonsense, for I don't suppose a hen ever\ntasted poached eggs, and surely she wouldn't be happy over the prospect\nof being fried.  Maybe one reason she sang was because she didn't know\nwhat was coming; I hardly think she'd be so tuneful if she did.\n\nSometimes the geese, shut in the barn, raised an awful clatter, and the\nhorses and cattle complained about being kept from the sunshine and\nfresh air.  You couldn't blame them.  It was a lovely day, and the big\nupper door the pleasantest place.  I didn't care if the fox hunters\nnever came, there was so much to see, hear, and smell.  Everything was\nbusy making signs of spring, and one could become tired of ice and snow\nafter a while, and so hungry for summer that those first days which\nwere just hints of what was coming were almost better than the real\nthing when it arrived.  Bud perfume was stronger than last week, many\ndoves and bluebirds were calling, and three days more of such sunshine\nwould make cross-country riding too muddy to be pleasant.  I sat there\nthinking; grown people never know how much children do think, they have\nso much time, and so many bothersome things to study out.  I heard it\nbehind me, a long, wailing, bellowing roar, and my hood raised right up\nwith my hair.  I was in the middle of the threshing floor in a second,\nin another at the little west door, cut into the big one, opening it a\ntiny crack to take a peep, and see how close they were.\n\nI could see nothing, but I heard a roar of dreadful sound steadily\nclosing in a circle around me.  No doubt the mean old foxes wished then\nthey had let the Dorking roosters alone.  Closer it came and more\ndreadful.  Never again did I want to hear such sounds coming at me;\neven when I knew what was making them.  And then away off, beyond\nPryors', and Hoods', and Dovers', I could see a line of tiny specks\ncoming toward me, and racing flying things that must have been people\non horses riding back and forth to give the foxes no chance to find a\nhiding place.  No chance!  Laddie and the Princess, Mr. Pryor and\nfather, and all of them were after the bad old foxes; and they were\ngoing to get them; because they'd have no chance--Not with a solid line\nof men with raving dogs surrounding them, and people on horseback\nracing after them, no! the foxes would wish now that they had left the\npigs and lambs alone.  In that awful roaring din, they would wish, Oh\nhow they would wish, they were birds and could fly!  Fly back to their\nholes like the Bible said they had, where maybe they LIKED to live, and\nno doubt they had little foxes there, that would starve when their\nmammies were caught alive, to save their skins.\n\nTo save their skins!  I could hear myself breathe, and feel my teeth\nclick, and my knees knock together.  And then!  Oh dear!  There they\ncame across our cornfield.  Two of them!  And they could fly, almost.\nAt least you could scarcely see that they touched the ground.  The mean\nold things were paying up for the pigs and lambs now.  Through the\nfence, across the road, straight toward me they came.  Almost red\nbacks, nearly white beneath, long flying tails, beautiful pointed ears,\nand long tongues, fire red, hanging from their open mouths; their sleek\nsides pulsing, and that awful din coming through the woods behind them.\nOne second, the first paused to glance toward either side, and threw\nback its head to listen.  What it saw, and heard, showed it.  I guess\nthen it was sorry it ever took people's ham, and their greens, and\ntheir blankets; and it could see and hear that it had no chance--to\nsave its skin.\n\n\"Oh Lord!  Dear Lord!  Help me!\" I prayed.\n\nIt had to be me, there was no one else.  I never had opened the big\ndoors; I thought it took a man, but when I pushed with all my\nmight--and maybe if the hairs of our heads were numbered, and the\nsparrows counted, there would be a little mercy for the foxes--I asked\nfor help; maybe I got it.  The doors went back, and I climbed up the\nladder to the haymow a few steps and clung there, praying with all my\nmight:  \"Make them come in!  Dear Lord, make them come in!  Give them a\nchance!  Help them to save their skins, O Lord!\"\n\nWith a whizz and a flash one went past me, skimmed the cider press, and\nrushed across the hay; then the other.  I fell to the floor and the\nnext thing I knew the doors were shut, and I was back at my place.  I\njust went down in a heap and leaned against the wall and shook, and\nthen I laughed and said:  \"Thank you, Lord!  Thank you for helping with\nthe door!  And the foxes!  The beautiful little red and white foxes!\nThey've got their chance!  They'll save their skins!  They'll get back\nto their holes and their babies!  Praise the Lord!\"\n\nI knew when I heard that come out, that it was exactly like my father\nsaid it when Amos Hurd was redeemed.  I never knew father to say it so\nimpressively before, because Amos had been so bad, people really were\nafraid of him, and father said if once he got started right, he would\ngo at it just as hard as he had gone at wrongdoing.  I suppose I\nshouldn't have said it about a fox, when there were the Dorkings, and\nham, and white wool dresses, and all that, but honestly, I couldn't\nremember that I cared particularly whether Amos Hurd was redeemed or\nnot; he was always lovely to children; while I never in all my life had\nwanted anything worse than I wanted those foxes to save their skins.  I\ncould hear them pant like run out dogs; and I could hear myself, and I\nhadn't been driven from my home and babies, maybe--and chased miles and\nmiles, either.\n\nThen I just shook.  They came pounding, roaring and braying right\naround the barn, and down the lane.  The little door flew open and a\nstrange man stuck in his head.\n\n\"Shut that door!\" I screamed.  \"You'll let them in on me, and they\nbite!  They're poison!  They'll kill me!\"\n\nI hadn't even thought of it before.\n\n\"See any foxes?\" cried the man.\n\n\"Two crossed our barnyard headed that way!\" I cried back, pointing\neast.  \"Shut the door!\"\n\nThe man closed it and ran calling as he went:  \"It's all right!  They\ncrossed the barnyard.  We've got them!\"\n\nI began to dance and beat my hands, and then I stopped and held my\nbreath.  They were passing, and the noise was dreadful.  They struck\nthe sides of the barn, poked around the strawstack, and something made\nme look up, and at the edge of the hay stood a fox ready to spring.  If\nit did, it would go from the door, right into the midst thereof.\nNothing but my red hood sailing straight at it, and a yell I have,\ndrove it back.  No one hit the barn again, the line closed up, and went\non at a run now, they were so anxious to meet and see what they had.\nThen came the beat of hoofs and I saw that all the riders had dropped\nback, and were behind the line of people on foot.  I watched Laddie as\nhe flew past waving to me, and I grabbed my scarf to wave at him.  The\nPrincess flashed by so swiftly I couldn't see how she looked, and then\nI heard a voice I knew cry:  \"Ep!  Ep!  Over Lad!\"  And I almost fell\ndead where I stood.  Mr. Pryor sailed right over the barnyard fence\ninto the cornfield, ripping that dumb-bell as he went, and neck and\nneck, even with him, on one of his finest horses, was our Leon.  His\nfeet were in the stirrups, he had the reins tight, he almost stood as\nhe arose, his face was crimson, his head bare, his white hair flying,\nthe grandest sight you ever saw.  At the top of my voice I screamed\nafter them, \"Ep!  Ep!  Over lad!\" and then remembered and looked to see\nif I had to chase back the foxes, but they didn't mind only me, after\nwhat they had been through.  Then I sat down suddenly again.\n\nWell!  What would father think of that!  Leon kill a horse of ours\nindeed!  There he was on one of Mr. Pryor's, worth as much as six of\nfather's no doubt, flying over fences, and the creek was coming, and\nthe bank was steep behind the barn.  I was up again straining to see.\n\n\"Ep!  Ep!  Over!\" rang the cry.\n\nThere they went!  Laddie and the Princess too.  I'll never spend\nanother cent on paper dolls, candy, raisins, or oranges.  I'll give all\nI have to help Leon buy his horse; then I'm going to begin saving for\nmine.\n\nThe line closed up, a solid wall of men with sticks, clubs and guns;\nthe dogs ranged outside, and those on horseback stopped where they\ncould see best; and inside, raced back and forth, and round and round,\nliving creatures.  I couldn't count they moved so, but even at that\ndistance I could see that some were poor little cotton tails.  The\nscared things!  A whack over the head, a backward toss, and the dogs\nwere mouthing them.  The long tailed, sleek, gracefully moving ones,\nthey were foxes, the foxes driven from their holes, and nothing on\nearth could save their skins for them now; those men meant to have them.\n\nI pulled the doors shut suddenly.  I was so sick I could scarcely\nstand.  I had to work, but at last I pushed the west doors open again.\nI don't think the Lord helped me any that time, for I knew what it\ntook--before, they just went.  Or maybe He did help me quite as much,\nbut I had harder work to do my share, because I felt so dizzy and ill.\nAnyway, they opened.  Then I climbed the upright ladder to the top\nbeam, walked it to the granary, and there I danced, pounded and yelled\nso that the foxes jumped from the hay, leaped lightly to the threshing\nfloor, and stood looking and listening.  I gave them time to hear where\nthe dreadful racket was, and then I jumped to the hay and threw the\npitchfork at them.  It came down smash! and both of them sprang from\nthe door.  When I got down the ladder and where I could see, they were\nso rested they were hiking across the cornfield like they never had\nraced a step before; and as the clamour went up behind me, that\nprobably meant the first fox had lost its beautiful red and white skin,\nthey reached our woods in safety.  The doors went shut easier, and I\nstarted to the house crying like any blubbering baby; but when mother\nturned from the east window, and I noticed her face, I forgot the foxes.\n\n\"You saw Leon!\" I cried.\n\n\"That I did!\" she exulted, rocking on her toes the same as she does at\nthe Meeting House when she is going to cry, \"Glory!\" any minute.  \"That\nI did!  Ah! the brave little chap!  Ah! the fine fellow!\"\n\nHer cheeks were the loveliest pink, and her eyes blazed.  I scarcely\nknew her.\n\n\"What will father say?\"\n\n\"If his father isn't every particle as proud of him as I am this day,\nI've a big disappointment coming,\" she answered.  \"If Mr. Pryor chose\nto let him take that fine horse, and taught him how to ride it, father\nshould be glad.\"\n\n\"If he'd gone into the creek, you wouldn't feel so fine.\"\n\n\"Ah! but he didn't!  He didn't!  He stuck to the saddle and sailed over\nin one grand, long sweep!  It was fine!  I hope--to my soul, I hope his\nfather saw it!\"\n\n\"He did!\" I said.  \"He did!  He was about halfway down the lane.  He\nwas where he could see fine.\"\n\n\"You didn't notice----?\"\n\n\"I was watching if Leon went under.  What if he had, mother?\"\n\n\"They'd have taken him out, and brought him to me, and I'd have worked\nwith all the strength and skill God has given me, and if it were\npossible to us, he would be saved, and if it were not, it would be a\nproud moment for a woman to offer a boy like that to the God who gave\nhim.  One would have nothing to be ashamed of!\"\n\n\"Could you do it, like you are now, and not cry, mother?\" I asked\nwonderingly.\n\n\"Patience no!\" said she.  \"Before long you will find out, child, that\nthe fountain head of tears and laughter lies in the same spot, deep in\na woman's heart.  Men were made for big things!  They must brave the\nwild animals, the Indians, fight the battles, ride the races, till the\nfields, build the homes.  In the making of a new country men must have\nthe thing in their souls that carried Leon across the creek.  If he had\nchecked that horse and gone to the ford, I would have fallen where I\nstood!\"\n\n\"Father crossed the ford!\"\n\n\"True!  But that's different.  He never had a chance at a horse like\nthat!  He never had time for fancy practice, and his nose would have\nbeen between the pages of a book if he had.  But remember this!  Your\nfather's hand has never faltered, and his aim has never failed.  All of\nus are here, safe and comfortable, through him.  It was your father who\nled us across the wilderness, and fended from us the wildcat, wolf, and\nIndian.  He built this house, cleared this land, and gave to all of us\nthe thing we love.  Get this in your head straight.  Your father rode a\nplow horse; he never tried flourishes in riding; but no man can stick\nin the saddle longer, ride harder, and face any danger with calmer\nfront.  If you think this is anything, you should have seen his face\nthe day he stood between me and a band of Indians, we had every reason\nto think, I had angered to the fighting point.\"\n\n\"Tell me!  Please tell me!\" I begged.\n\nAll of us had been brought up on that story, but we were crazy to hear\nit, and mother loved to tell it, so she dropped on a chair and began:\n\n\"We were alone in a cabin in the backwoods of Ohio.  Elizabeth was only\nnine months old, and father always said a mite the prettiest of any\nbaby we ever had.  Many of the others have looked quite as well to me,\nbut she was the first, and he was so proud of her he always wanted me\nto wait in the wagon until he hitched the horses, so he would get to\ntake and to carry her himself.  Well, she was in the cradle, cooing and\nlaughing, and I had my work all done, and cabin shining.  I was heating\na big poker red-hot, and burning holes into the four corners of a board\nso father could put legs in it to make me a bench.  A greasy old squaw\ncame to the door with her papoose on her back.  She wanted to trade\nberries for bread.  There were berries everywhere for the picking; I\nhad more dried than I could use in two years.  We planted only a little\npatch of wheat and father had to ride three days to carry to mill what\nhe could take on a horse.  I baked in an outoven and when it was done,\na loaf of white bread was by far the most precious thing we had to eat.\nSometimes I was caught, and forced to let it go.  Often I baked during\nthe night and hid the bread in the wheat at the barn.  There was none\nin the cabin that day and I said so.  She didn't believe me.  She set\nher papoose on the floor beside the fireplace, and went to the\ncupboard.  There wasn't a crumb there except cornbread, and she didn't\nwant that.  She said:  'Brod!  Brod!'\n\n\"She learned that from the Germans in the settlement.  I shook my head.\nThen she pulled out a big steel hunting knife, such as the whites\ntraded to the Indians so they would have no trouble in scalping us\nneatly, and walked to the cradle.  She took that knife loosely between\nher thumb and second finger and holding it directly above my baby's\nface, she swung it lightly back and forth and demanded:  'Brod!  Brod!'\n\n\"If the knife fell, it would go straight through my baby's head, and\nElizabeth was reaching her little hands and laughing.  There was only\none thing to do, and I did it.  I caught that red-hot poker from the\nfire, and stuck it so close her baby's face, that the papoose drew back\nand whimpered.  I scarcely saw how she snatched it up and left.  When\nyour father came, I told him, and we didn't know what to do.  We knew\nshe would come back and bring her band.  If we were not there, they\nwould burn the cabin, ruin our crops, kill our stock, take everything\nwe had, and we couldn't travel so far, or so fast, that on their ponies\nthey couldn't overtake us.  We endangered any one with whom we sought\nrefuge, so we gripped hands, knelt down and told the Lord all about it,\nand we felt the answer was to stay.  Father cleaned the gun, and hours\nand hours we waited.\n\n\"About ten o'clock the next day they came, forty braves in war paint\nand feathers.  I counted until I was too sick to see, then I took the\nbaby in my arms and climbed to the loft, with our big steel knife in\none hand.  If your father fell, I was to use it, first on Elizabeth,\nthen on myself.  The Indians stopped at the woodyard, and the chief of\nthe band came to the door, alone.  Your father met him with his gun in\nreach, and for a whole eternity they stood searching each other's eyes.\nI was at the trapdoor where I could see both of them.\n\n\"To the depths of my soul I enjoyed seeing Leon take the fence and\ncreek: but what was that, child, to compare with the timber that stood\nyour father like a stone wall between me and forty half-naked, paint\nbesmeared, maddened Indians?  Don't let any showing the men of to-day\ncan make set you to thinking that father isn't a king among men.  Not\nonce, but again and again in earlier days, he fended danger from me\nlike that.  I can shut my eyes and see his waving hair, his white brow,\nhis steel blue eyes, his unfaltering hand.  I don't remember that I had\ntime or even thought to pray.  I gripped the baby, and the knife, and\nwaited for the thing I must do if an arrow or a shot sailed past the\nchief and felled father.  They stood second after second, like two\nwooden men, and then slowly and deliberately the chief lighted his big\npipe, drew a few puffs and handed it to father.  He set down his gun,\ntook the pipe and quite as slowly and deliberately he looked at the\nwaiting band, at the chief, and then raised it to his lips.\n\n\"'White squaw brave!  Heap much brave!' said the chief.\n\n\"'In the strength of the Lord.  Amen!' said father.\n\n\"Then he reached his hand and the chief took it, so I came down the\nladder and stood beside father, as the Indians began to file in the\nfront door and out the back.  As they passed, every man of them made\nthe peace sign and piled in a heap, venison, fish, and game, while each\nsquaw played with the baby and gave me a gift of beads, a metal\ntrinket, or a blanket she had woven.  After that they came often, and\nbrought gifts, and if prowling Gypsies were pilfering, I could look to\nsee a big Indian loom up and seat himself at my fireside until any\ndanger was past.  I really got so I liked and depended on them, and\nfather left me in their care when he went to mill, and I was safe as\nwith him.  You have heard the story over and over, but to-day is the\ntime to impress on you that an exhibition like THIS is the veriest\nchild's play compared with what I have seen your father do repeatedly!\"\n\n\"But it was you, the chief said was brave!\"\n\nMother laughed.\n\n\"I had to be, baby,\" she said.  \"Mother had no choice.  There's only\none way to deal with an Indian.  I had lived among them all my life,\nand I knew what must be done.\"\n\n\"I think both of you were brave,\" I said, \"you, the bravest!\"\n\n\"Quite the contrary,\" laughed mother.  \"I shall have to confess that\nwhat I did happened so quickly I'd no time to think.  I only realized\nthe coal red iron was menacing the papoose when it drew back and\nwhimpered.  Father had all night to face what was coming to him, and it\nwas not one to one, but one to forty, with as many more squaws, as good\nfighters as the braves, to back them.  It was a terror but I never have\nbeen sorry we went through it together.  I have rested so securely in\nyour father ever since.\"\n\n\"And he is as safe in you,\" I insisted.\n\n\"As you will,\" said mother.  \"This world must have her women quite as\nmuch as her men.  It is shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, business.\"\n\nThe clamour in the meadow arose above our voices and brought us back to\nthe foxes.\n\n\"There goes another!\" I said, the tears beginning to roll again.\n\n\"It is heathenish business,\" said mother.  \"I don't blame you!  If\npeople were not too shiftless to care for their stuff, the foxes\nwouldn't take their chickens and geese.  They never get ours!\"\n\n\"Hoods aren't shiftless!\" I sobbed.\n\n\"There are always exceptions,\" said mother, \"and they are the exception\nin this case.\"\n\nThe door flew open and Leon ran in.  He was white with excitement, and\ntrembling.\n\n\"Mother, come and see me take a fence on Pryor's Rocket!\" he cried.\n\nMother had him in her arms.\n\n\"You little whiffet!\" she said.  \"You little tow-haired whiffet!\"\n\nBoth of them were laughing and crying at the same time, and so was I.\n\n\"I saw you take one fence and the creek, Weiscope!\" she said, holding\nhim tight, and stroking his hair.  \"That will do for to-day.  Ride the\nhorse home slowly, rub it down if they will allow you, and be sure to\nremember your manners when you leave.  To trust such a child as you\nwith so valuable a horse, and for Mr. Pryor to personally ride with you\nand help you, I think that was a big thing for a man like him to do.\"\n\n\"But, mother, he's been showing me for weeks, or I couldn't have done\nit to-day.  It was our secret to surprise you.  When I get my horse,\nI'll be able to ride a little, as well as Mr. Laddie.\"\n\n\"Leon, don't,\" said mother, gripping him tighter.\n\n\"You must bear in mind, word about that money may come any day.\"\n\n\"Aw, it won't either,\" said Leon, pulling away.  \"And say, mother, that\ndumb-bell was like country boys make in England.  He helped me hunt the\nwood and showed me, and I couldn't ride and manage it, so he had it all\nday, and you should have heard him make it rip.  Say, mother, take my\nword, he was some pumpkins in England.  I bet he ordered the Queen\naround, when he was there!\"\n\n\"No doubt!\" laughed mother, kissing him and pushing him from the door.\n\nSome people are never satisfied.  After that splendid riding and the\nperfect day, father, Leon, and Laddie came home blaming every one, and\nfinding fault, and trying to explain how it happened, that the people\nfrom the east side claimed two foxes, and there was only one left for\nthe west side, when they had seen and knew they had driven three for\nmiles.  They said they lost them in our Big Woods.\n\nI didn't care one speck.  I would as lief wear a calico dress, and let\nthe little foxes have their mammies to feed them; and I was willing to\nbet all my money that we would have as much ham, and as many greens\nnext summer as we ever had.  And if the foxes took Hoods' Dorkings\nagain, let them build a coop with safe foundations.  The way was to use\nstone and heap up dirt around it in the fall, to be perfectly sure, and\nmake it warmer.\n\nWe took care of our chickens because we had to have them.  All the year\nwe needed them, but most especially for Easter.  Mother said that was\nordained chicken time.  Turkeys for Thanksgiving, sucking pigs for\nChristmas, chickens for Easter, goose, she couldn't abide.  She thought\nit was too strong.  She said the egg was a symbol of life; of\nawakening, of birth, and the chickens came from the eggs, first ones\nabout Easter, so that proved it was chicken time.\n\nI am going to quit praying about little things I can manage myself.\nFather said no prayer would bring an answer unless you took hold and\npulled with all your being for what you wanted.  I had been intending\nfor days to ask the Lord to help me find where Leon hid his Easter\neggs.  It had been the law at our house from the very first, that for\nthe last month before Easter, aside from what mother had to have for\nthe house, all of us might gather every egg we could find and keep them\nuntil Easter.  If we could locate the hiding place of any one else, we\nmight take all theirs.  The day before Easter they were brought in,\nmother put aside what she required, and the one who had the most got to\nsell all of them and take the money.  Sometimes there were two washtubs\nfull, and what they brought was worth having, for sure.  So we watched\nall year for safe places, and when the time came we almost ran after\nthe hens with a basket.  Because Laddie and Leon were bigger they could\noutrun us, and lots of hens laid in the barn, so there the boys always\nhad first chance.  Often during the month we would find and take each\nother's eggs a dozen times.\n\nWe divided them, and hid part in different places, so that if either\nwere found there would still be some left.\n\nLaddie had his in the hopper of the cider press right on the threshing\nfloor, and as he was sure to get more than I had anyway, I usually put\nmine with his.  May had hers some place, and where Leon had his, none\nof us could find or imagine.  I almost lay awake of nights trying to\nthink, and every time I thought of a new place, the next day I would\nlook, and they wouldn't be there.  Three days before Easter, mother\nbegan to cook and get the big dinner ready, and she ran short of eggs.\nShe told me to go to the barn and tell the boys that each of them must\nsend her a dozen as quickly as they could.  Of course that was fair, if\nshe made both give up the same number.  So I went to the barn.\n\nThe lane was muddy, and as I had been sick, I wore my rubbers that\nspring.  I thought to keep out of the deep mud, where horses and cattle\ntrampled, I'd go up the front embankment, and enter the little door.\nMy feet made no sound, and it so happened that the door didn't either,\nand as I started to open it.  I saw Leon disappearing down the\nstairway, with a big sack on his back.  I thought it was corn for the\nhorses, and followed him, but he went to the cow stable door and\nstarted toward the lane, and then I thought it was for the pigs, so I\ncalled Laddie and told him about the eggs.  He said he'd give me two\ndozen of his, and Leon could pay him back.  We went together to get\nthem, and there was only one there.\n\nWasn't that exactly like Leon?  Leave ONE for the nest egg!  If he were\ndying and saw a joke or a trick, he'd stop to play it before he\nfinished, if he possibly could.  If he had no time at all, then he'd go\nwith his eyes twinkling over the thoughts of the fun it would have been\nif he possibly could have managed it.  Of course when we saw that one\nlonely egg in the cider hopper, just exactly like the \"Last Rose of\nSummer, left to pine on the stem,\" I thought of the sack Leon carried,\nand knew what had been in it.  We hurried out and tried to find him,\nbut he was swallowed up.  You couldn't see him or hear a sound of him\nanywhere.\n\nMother was as cross as she ever gets.  Right there she made a new rule,\nand it was that two dozen eggs must be brought to the house each day,\nwhether any were hidden or not.  She had to stop baking until she got\neggs.  She said a few times she had used a goose egg in custard.  I\ncould fix that.  I knew where one of our gray geese had a nest, and if\nshe'd cook any goose egg, it would be a gray one.  Of course I had\nsense enough not to take a blue one.  So I slipped from the east door,\ncrossed the yard and orchard corner, climbed the fence and went down\nthe lane.  There was the creek up and tearing.  It was half over the\nmeadow, and the floodgate between the pasture and the lane rocked with\nthe rush of water; still, I believed I could make it.  So I got on the\nfence and with my feet on the third rail, and holding by the top one, I\nwalked sidewise, and so going reached the floodgate.  It was pretty\nwobbly, but I thought I could cross on the run.  I knew I could if I\ndared jump at the other end; but there the water was over the third\nrail, and that meant above my head.\n\nIt was right at that time of spring when you felt so good you thought\nyou could do most anything, except fly--I tried that once--so I went\non.  The air was cold for all the sun shone, the smell of catkin\npollen, bursting buds, and the odour of earth steaming in the sun, was\nin every breath; the blackbirds were calling, and the doves; the\nganders looked longingly at the sky and screamed a call to every\npassing wild flock, and Deams' rooster wanted to fight all creation, if\nyou judged by the boasting he was doing from their barnyard gate.  He\nmade me think of eggs, so I set my jaws, looked straight ahead, and\nscooted across the floodgate to the post that held it and the rails of\nthe meadow fence.  I made it too, and then the fence was easy, only I\nhad to double quite short, because the water was over the third rail\nthere, but at last it was all gone, and I went to the fence corner and\nthere was the goose on the nest, laying an egg.  She had built on a\nlittle high place, among puddles, wild rose bushes, and thorns, and the\nold thing wouldn't get off.  She just sat there and stuck out her head\nand hissed and hissed.  I never noticed before that geese were so big\nand so aggravating.  I wasn't going to give up, after that floodgate,\nso I hunted a big stick, set it against her wing, pushed her off and\ngrabbed three eggs and ran.  When I got to the fence, I was in a pickle\nfor sure.  I didn't know what in the world to do with the eggs.\n\nAt last I unbuttoned my coat, put them in my apron front, gathered it\nup, and holding it between my teeth, started back.  I had to double\nmore than ever on account of the eggs, and when I reached the floodgate\nit rocked like a branch in the wind; but I had to get back, so I rested\nand listened to the larks a while.  That was a good plan.  They were\ncalling for mates, and what they said was so perfectly lovely, you\ncouldn't think of anything else; and the less you thought about how\nthat gate rocked, and how deep and swift the water ran, the better for\nyou.  At last one lark went almost from sight and he rang, twisted and\ntrilled his call, until my heart swelled so big it hurt.  I crossed on\nthe jump with no time to think at all.  That was a fine plan, for I\nmade it, but I hit the post so hard I broke the middle egg.  I was\ngoing to throw it away, but there was so much starch in my apron it\nheld like a dish, and it had been clean that morning, now the egg\nsoiled it anyway, so I ran and got home all right.\n\nMother was so pleased about the eggs she changed the apron and never\nsaid a word, except to brag on me.  She said she couldn't keep house\nwithout me, and I guess that was a fact.  I came in handy a lot of\ntimes.  But at dinner when she scolded the boys about the eggs, and\ntold them I brought the goose eggs for her custard, else there would\nhave been no pie, father broke loose, and I thought he was going to\nwhip me sure.  He told mother all about the water and the gate, and how\nI had to cross, and he said, 'it was a dispensation of Providence that\nwe didn't have a funeral instead of celebrating Easter,' so I said:\n\n\"Well, if you think I came so near drowning myself, when you rejoice\nbecause Christ is risen from the dead, you can be glad I am too, and\nthat will make it all the better.\"\n\nThe boys laughed, but father said it was no laughing matter.  I think\nthat speech saved me from going on the threshing floor, for he took me\non his lap when I thought I'd have to go, and told me never, never to\ndo anything like that again, and then he hugged me until I almost\nbroke.  Gracious!  He should have seen us going to school some days.\nWhy, we even walked the top rail when it was the only one above water,\nand we could cross the bridge if we wanted to.  At least when Laddie or\nMiss Amelia was not around, we did.\n\nLeon was so bursting full he scarcely could eat, and Laddie looked\npretty glum when he had to admit he had no eggs; so Laddie had to hand\nover the whole two dozen.  Leon didn't mind that, but he said if he\nmust, then all of us should stay in the dining-room until he brought\nthem, because of course he couldn't walk straight and get them in broad\ndaylight with us watching, and not show where they were.  Father said\nthat was fair, so Leon went out and before so very long he came back\nwith the eggs.\n\nI thought until my skull almost cracked, about where he COULD have\ngone, and I was almost to the place where the thing seemed serious\nenough that I'd ask the Lord to help me find Laddie's eggs, when mother\nsent me to the garret for red onion skins.  She had an hour to rest,\nand she was going to spend it fixing decorations for our eggs.  Of\ncourse there were always red and black aniline ones, and yellow and\nblue, but none of us ever like them half so well as those mother\ncoloured, herself.\n\nShe took the dark red skins and cut boys, girls, dogs, cats, stars,\nflowers, butterflies, fish, and everything imaginable, and wet the\nskins a little and laid them on very white eggs that had been soaked in\nalum water to cut the grease, and then wrapped light yellow skins over,\nand then darker ones, and at last layer after layer of cloth, and wet\nthat, and roasted them an hour in hot ashes and then let them cool and\ndry, before unwrapping.  When she took them out, rubbed on a little\ngrease and polished them--there they were!  They would have our names,\nflowers, birds, animals, all in pale yellow, deep rich brown, almost\nred, and perfectly beautiful colours, while you could hunt and hunt\nbefore you found everything on one egg.  And sometimes the onion skins\nslipped, and made things of themselves that she never put on.\n\nI was coming from the bin with an apron full of skins and I almost fell\nover.  I couldn't breathe for a long time.  I danced on my toes, and\nheld my mouth to keep from screaming.  On the garret floor before me\nlay a little piece of wet mud, and the faintest outline of a boot, a\nboot about Leon's size.  That was all I needed to know.  As soon as I\ncould hold steady, I took the skins to mother, slipped back and hunted\ngood; and of course I had to find them--grainsacks half full of\nthem--carried in the front door in the evening, and up the front\nstairs, where no one went until bedtime, unless there were company.\nAway back under the eaves, across the joists, behind the old clothing\nwaiting to be ripped, coloured and torn for carpet rangs and rugs, Mr.\nLeon had almost every egg that had been laid on the place for a month.\n\nNOW he'd see what he'd get for taking Laddie's!\n\nThen I stopped short.  What I thought most made me sick, but I didn't\npropose to lie in bed again for a year at least, for it had its bad\nparts as well as its good; so I went straight and whispered to Laddie.\nHe never looked pleased at all, so I knew I had been right.  He kissed\nme, and thanked me, and then said slowly:  \"It's mighty good of you,\nLittle Sister, but you see it wouldn't be FAIR.  He found mine himself,\nso he had a right to take them.  But I don't dare touch his, when you\ntell me where they are.  I never in a month of Sundays would have\nlooked for them in the house.  I was going to search the wood house and\nsmoke house this afternoon.  I can't take them.  But thank you just as\nmuch.\"\n\nThen I went to father and he laughed.  How he did laugh!\n\n\"Laddie is right!\" he said at last.  \"He didn't find them, and he\nmustn't take them.  But you may!  They're yours!  That front door\nscheme of Leon's was fairly well, but it wasn't quite good enough.  If\nhe'd cleaned his feet as he should, before he crossed mother's carpet\nand climbed the stairs, he'd have made it all right.  'His tracks\nbetrayed him,' as tracks do all of us, if we are careless enough to\nleave any.  The eggs are yours, and to-night is the time to produce\nthem.  Where do you want to hide them?\"\n\nWell of all things! and after I had stumbled on them without pestering\nthe Lord, either!  Just as slick as anything!  Mine!  I never ever\nthought of it.  But when I did think, I liked it.  The more I thought,\nthe funnier it grew.\n\n\"Under mother's bed,\" I whispered.  \"But I never can get them.  They're\nin wheat sacks, and full so high, and they'll have to be handled like\neggs.\"\n\n\"I'll do the carrying,\" laughed father.  \"Come show me!\"\n\nSo we took all those eggs, and put them under mother's bed.\n\nOf course she and Candace saw us, but they didn't hunt eggs and they'd\nnever tell.  If ever I thought I'd burst wide open!  About dusk I saw\nLeon coming from the barn carrying his hat at his side--more eggs--so I\nran like a streak and locked the front door, and then slipped back in\nthe dining-room and almost screamed, when I could hear him trying it,\nand he couldn't get in.  After a while he came in, fussed around, and\nfinally went into the sitting-room, and the key turned and he went\nupstairs.  I knew I wouldn't dare look at him when he came down, so I\ngot a reader and began on a piece I just love:\n\n  \"A nightingale made a mistake;\n    She sang a few notes out of tune:\n  Her heart was ready to break,\n    And she hid away from the moon.\"\n\n\nWhen I did get a peep, gracious but he was black!  Maybe it wasn't\ngoing to be so much fun after all.  But he had the money last year, and\nthe year before, and if he'd cleaned his feet well--I was not hunting\nhis eggs, when I found them.  \"His tracks betrayed him,\" as father\nsaid.  I was thankful supper was ready just then, and while it was\ngoing on mother said:  \"As soon as you finish, all bring in your eggs.\nI want to wrap the ones to colour to-night, and bury them in the\nfireplace so they will colour, dry, and be ready to open in the\nmorning.\"\n\nNo one said a word, but neither Laddie nor Leon looked very happy, and\nI took awful bites to keep my face straight.  When all of us finished\nMay brought a lot from the bran barrel in the smoke house, but Laddie\nand Leon only sat there and looked silly; it really was funny.\n\n\"I must have more eggs than this?\" said mother.  \"Where are they to\ncome from?\"\n\nFather nodded to me and I said:  \"From under your bed!\"\n\n\"Oh, it was you!  And I never once caught you snooping!\" cried Leon.\n\n\"Easy son!\" said father.  \"That will do.  You lost through your own\ncarelessness.  You left wet mud on the garret floor, and she saw it\nwhen mother sent her for the onion skins.  You robbed Laddie of his\nlast egg this morning; be a good loser yourself!\"\n\n\"Well, anyway, you didn't get 'em,\" said Leon to Laddie.\n\n\"And she only found them by accident!\"\n\nThen we had a big time counting all those eggs, and such another heap\nas there was to sell, after mother filled baskets to cook with and\ncolour.  When the table was cleared, Laddie and Leon made tallow\npencils from a candle and wrote all sorts of things over eggs that had\nbeen prepared to colour.  Then mother boiled them in copperas water,\nand aniline, and all the dyes she had, and the boys polished them, and\nthey stood in shining black, red, blue and yellow heaps.  The onion\nones would be done in the morning.  Leon had a goose egg and mother let\nhim keep it, so he wrote and wrote on it, until Laddie said it would be\nall writing, and no colour, and he boiled it in red, after mother\nfinished, and polished it himself.  It came out real pretty with roses\non it and lots of words he wouldn't let any of us read; but of course\nit was for Susie Fall.\n\nNext morning he slipped it to her at church.  When we got home, all of\nus were there except Shelley, and we had a big dinner and a fine time\nand Laddie stayed until after supper, before he went to Pryors'.\n\n\"How is he making it?\" asked Sally.\n\n\"You could see she was making it all right; she never looked lovelier,\nand mother said Peter was letting her spend away too much money on her\nclothes.  She told him so, but Peter just laughed and said business was\ngood, and he could afford it, and she was a fine advertisement for his\nstore when she was dressed well.\"\n\n\"All I know is,\" said mother, \"that he goes there every whipstitch, and\nthe women, at least, seem glad to have him.  He says Mr. Pryor treats\nhim decently, and that is more than he does his own family and\nservants.  He and the girl and her mother are divided about something.\nShe treats her father respectfully, but she's in sympathy with mother.\"\n\n\"Laddie can't find out what the trouble is?\"\n\n\"I don't think that he tries.\"\n\n\"Maybe he'd feel better not to know,\" said Peter.\n\n\"Possibly!\" said mother.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said father.\n\n\"You seem to be reconciled,\" said Elizabeth.\n\n\"That girl would reconcile a man to anything,\" said father.\n\n\"Not to the loss of his soul, I hope,\" said mother stiffly.\n\n\"Souls are not so easy to lose,\" said father.  \"Besides, I am counting\non Laddie saving hers.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThe Garden of the Lord\n\n  \"With what content and merriment,\n  Their days are spent, whose minds are bent\n  To follow the useful plow.\"\n\n\nThat spring I decided if school didn't stop pretty soon, I'd run away\nagain, and I didn't in the least care what they did to me.  A country\nroad was all right and it was good enough, if it had been heaped up,\nleveled and plenty of gravel put on; and of course our road would be\nfine, because father was one of the commissioners, and as long as he\nfilled that office, every road in the county would be just as fine as\nthe law would allow him to make it.  I have even heard him tell mother\nthat he \"stretched it a leetle mite,\" when he was forced to by people\nwho couldn't seem to be made to understand what was required to upbuild\na nation.  He said our language was founded on the alphabet, and to\nmaster it you had to begin with \"a\".  And he said the nation was like\nthat; it was based on townships, and when a township was clean, had\ngood roads, bridges, schoolhouses, and churches, a county was in fine\nshape, and when each county was in order, the state was right, and when\nthe state was prosperous, the nation could rejoice in its strength.\n\nHe said Atlas in the geography book, carrying the world on his back,\nwas only a symbol, but it was a good one.  He said when the county\nelected him to fill an important office, it used his shoulder as a prop\nfor the nation, so it became his business to stand firmly, and use\nevery ounce of strength and brains he had, first of all to make his own\npossessions a model, then his township, his county, and his state, and\nif every one worked together doing that, no nation on earth had our\namount of territory and such fine weather, so none of them could beat\nus.\n\nOur road was like the barn floor, where you drove: on each side was a\nwide grassy strip, and not a weed the length of our land.  All the\nrails in the fences were laid straight, the gates were solid, sound,\nand swung firmly on their beams, our fence corners were full of alders,\nwild roses, sumac, blackberry vines, masses of wild flowers beneath\nthem, and a bird for every bush.  Some of the neighbours thought that\nto drive two rails every so often, lay up the fences straight, and grub\nout the shrubs was the way, but father said they were vastly mistaken.\nHe said that was such a shortsighted proceeding, he would be ashamed to\nindulge in it.  You did get more land, but if you left no place for the\nbirds, the worms and insects devoured your crops, and you didn't raise\nhalf so much as if you furnished the birds shelter and food.  So he\nleft mulberries in the fields and fence corners and wild cherries,\nraspberries, grapes, and every little scrub apple tree from seeds sown\nby Johnny Appleseed when he crossed our land.\n\nMother said those apples were so hard a crane couldn't dent them, but\nshe never watched the birds in winter when the snow was beginning to\ncome and other things were covered up.  They swarmed over those trees\nuntil spring, for the tiny sour apples stuck just like oak leaves\nwaiting for next year's crop to push them off.  She never noticed us,\neither.  After a few frosts, we could almost get tipsy on those apples;\nthere was not a tree in our orchard that had the spicy, teasing tang of\nJohnny Appleseed's apples.  Then too, the limbs could be sawed off and\nrambo and maiden's-blush grafted on, if you wanted to; father did on\nsome of them, so there would be good apples lying beside the road for\npassers-by, and they needn't steal to get them.  You could graft red\nhaws on them too, and grow great big, little haw-apples, that were the\nprettiest things you ever saw, and the best to eat.  Father said if it\ndidn't spoil the looks of the road, he wouldn't care how many of his\nneighbours straightened their fences.  If they did, the birds would\ncome to him, and the more he had, the fewer bugs and worms he would be\ntroubled with, so he would be sure of big crops, and sound fruit.  He\nsaid he would much rather have a few good apples picked by robins or\njays, than untouched trees, loaded with wormy falling ones he could\nneither use nor sell.  He always patted my head and liked every line of\nit when I recited, sort of tearful-like and pathetic:\n\n  \"Don't kill the birds! the happy birds,\n  That bless the field and grove;\n  So innocent to look upon,\n  They claim our warmest love.\"\n\n\nThe roads crossing our land were all right, and most of the others near\nus; and a road is wonderful, if it is taking you to the woods or a\ncreek or meadow; but when it is walking you straight to a stuffy little\nschoolhouse where you must stand up to see from a window, where a\nteacher is cross as fire, like Miss Amelia, and where you eternally\nHEAR things you can't see, there comes a time about the middle of April\nwhen you had quite as soon die as to go to school any longer; and what\nyou learn there doesn't amount to a hill of beans compared with what\nyou can find out for yourself outdoors.\n\nSchoolhouses are made wrong.  If they must be, they should be built in\na woods pasture beside a stream, where you could wade, swim, and be\ncomfortable in summer, and slide and skate in winter.  The windows\nshould be cut to the floor, and stand wide open, so the birds and\nbutterflies could pass through.  You ought to learn your geography by\nclimbing a hill, walking through a valley, wading creeks, making\nislands in them, and promontories, capes, and peninsulas along the\nbank.  You should do your arithmetic sitting under trees adding\nhickory-nuts, subtracting walnuts, multiplying butternuts, and dividing\nhazelnuts.  You could use apples for fractions, and tin cups for liquid\nmeasure.  You could spell everything in sight and this would teach you\nthe words that are really used in the world.  Every single one of us\ncould spell incompatibility, but I never heard father, or the judge, or\neven the Bishop, put it in a speech.\n\nIf you simply can't have school THAT way, then you should be shut in\nblack cells, deep under the ground, where you couldn't see, or hear a\nsound, and then if they'd give you a book and candle and Miss Amelia,\nand her right-hand man, Mister Ruler, why you might learn something.\nThis way, if you sat and watched the windows you could see a bird cross\nour woods pasture to the redbird swamp every few minutes; once in a\nwhile one of my big hawks took your breath as he swept, soared, sailed,\nand circled, watching the ground below for rabbits, snakes, or\nchickens.  The skinny old blue herons crossing from the Wabash to hunt\nfrogs in the cowslip swale in our meadow, sailed so slow and so low,\nthat you could see their sharp bills stuck out in front, their uneven,\nragged looking feathers, and their long legs trailing out behind.  I\nbet if Polly Martin wore a blue calico dress so short her\nspindle-shanks showed, and flew across our farm, you couldn't tell her\nfrom a heron.\n\nThere were so many songs you couldn't decide which was which to save\nyou; it was just a pouring jumble of robins, larks, doves, blackbirds,\nsparrows, everything that came that early; the red and the yellow birds\nhad not come yet, or the catbirds or thrushes.  You could hear the\nthumping wings of the roosters in Sills' barnyard nearest the\nschoolhouse, and couldn't tell which was whipping, so you had to sit\nthere and wonder; and worst of all you must stand Miss Amelia calmly\ntelling you to pay attention to your books or you would be kept in, and\nall the time you were forced to bear torments, while you watched her\nwalk from window to window to see every speck of the fight.  One day\nthey had thumped and fought for half an hour; she had looked from every\nwindow in the room, and at last there was an awful whacking, and then\nsilence.  It grew so exciting I raised my hand, and almost before she\nnodded permission, \"Which whipped?\" I asked.\n\nMiss Amelia turned red as a beet.  Gee, but she was mad!\n\n\"I did!\" she said.  \"Or at least I will.  You may remain for it after\nschool is dismissed.\"\n\nNow if you are going to be switched, they never do it until they are\njust so angry anyway, and then they always make it as hard as they dare\nnot to stripe you, so it isn't much difference HOW provoked they are,\nit will be the same old thrashing, and it's sure to sting for an hour\nat least, so you might as well be beaten for a little more as hardly\nanything at all.  At that instant from the fence not far from my window\ncame a triumphant crow that fairly ripped across the room.\n\n\"Oh, it was the Dorking!\" I said.  \"No wonder you followed clear around\nthe room to see him thrash a Shanghai three times his size!  I bet a\ndollar it was great!\"\n\nUsually, I wouldn't have put up more than five cents, but at that time\nI had over six dollars from my Easter eggs, and no girl of my age at\nour school ever had half that much.  Miss Amelia started toward me, and\nI braced my feet so she'd get a good jolt herself, when she went to\nshake me; she never struck us over the head since Laddie talked to her\nthat first day; but John Hood's foot was in the aisle.  I thought maybe\nI'd have him for my beau when we grew up, because I bet he knew she was\ncoming, and stuck out his foot on purpose; anyway, she pitched, and had\nto catch a desk to keep off the floor, and that made her so mad at him,\nthat she forgot me, while he got his scolding; so when my turn came at\nlast, she had cooled down enough that she only marched past to her\ndesk, saying I was to remain after school.  I had to be careful after\nthat to be mighty good to May and Leon.\n\nWhen school was out they sat on the steps before the door and waited.\nMiss Amelia fussed around and there they sat.  Then her face grew more\ngobblerish than usual, and she went out and told them to go home.\nPlain as anything I heard May say It:  \"She's been awful sick, you\nknow, and mother wouldn't allow it.\"  And then Leon piped up:  \"You DID\nwatch the roosters, all the time they fought, and of course all of us\nwanted to see just as badly as you did.\"\n\nShe told them if they didn't go right home she'd bring them back and\nwhip them too; so they had to start, and leave me to my sad fate.  I\nwas afraid they had made it sadder, instead of helping me; she was so\nprovoked when she came in she was crying, and over nothing but the\nplain truth too; if we had storied on her, she'd have had some cause to\nbeller.  She arranged her table, cleaned the board, emptied the water\nbucket, and closed the windows.  Then she told me I was a rude,\nuntrained child.  I was rude, I suppose, but goodness knows, I wasn't\nuntrained; that was hard on father and mother; I had a big notion to\ntell them; and then, she never whipped me at all.  She said if I wanted\nher to love me, I mustn't be a saucy, impudent girl, and I should go\nstraight home and think it over.\n\nI went, but I was so dazed at her thinking I wanted her to love me,\nthat I hardly heard May and Leon calling; when I did I went to the\ncemetery fence and there they lay in the long grass waiting.\n\n\"If you cried, we were coming back and pitch into her,\" said Leon.\n\nThere was a pointer.  Next time, first cut she gave me, I decided to\nscream bloody murder.  But that would be no Crusader way.  There was\none thing though.  No Crusader ever sat and heard a perfectly lovely\nfight going on, and never even wondered which whipped.\n\nMay and Leon stepped one on each side, took a hand, and we ran like\nIndians, and slid down the hill between the bushes, climbed the fence,\ncrossed the pasture back of the church, and went to the creek.  There\nwe sat on a log, I told them, and we just laughed.  I didn't know what\nI could do to pay them, for they saved me sure as fate that time.\n\nI wished we lived in the woods the way it was when father and mother\nwere married and moved to Ohio.  The nearest neighbours were nine\nmiles, and there wasn't a dollar for school funds, so of course the\nchildren didn't have to go, and what their fathers and mothers taught\nthem was all they knew.  That would not have helped me much though, for\nwe never had one single teacher who knew anything to compare with what\nfather and mother did, and we never had one who was forever reading\nbooks, papers, and learning more things that help, to teach other\npeople.  I wished father had time to take our school.  It would have\nbeen some fun to go to him, because I just knew he would use the woods\nfor the room, and teach us things it would do some good to know about.\n\nI began debating whether it was a big enough thing to bother the Lord\nwith: this being penned up in the schoolhouse droning over spelling and\nnumbers, when you could smell tree bloom, flower bloom, dozens of birds\nwere nesting, and everything was beginning to hum with life.  I\ncouldn't think for that piece about \"Spring\" going over in my head:\n\n  \"I am coming, I am coming:\n    Hark! the little bee is humming:\n  See! the lark is soaring high,\n    In the bright and sunny sky;\n  All the birds are on the wing:\n    Little maiden, now is spring.\"\n\n\nI made up my mind that it was of enough importance to call for the\nbiggest prayer I could think of and that I would go up in the barn to\nthe top window, stand on a beam, and turn my face to the east, where\nJesus used to be, and I'd wrestle with the Lord for freedom, as Jacob\nwrestled with the Angel on the banks of the Jabbok in the land of\nAmmon.  I was just getting up steam to pray as hard as ever I could;\nfor days I'd been thinking of it, and I was nearly to the point where\none more killdeer crying across the sky would have sent me headlong\nfrom the schoolhouse anywhere that my feet were on earth, and the air\ndidn't smell of fried potatoes, kraut, sweat, and dogs, like it did\nwhenever you sat beside Clarissa Polk.  When I went to supper one\nnight; father had been to Groveville, and he was busy over his papers.\nAfter he finished the blessing, he seemed worried, at last he said the\nfunds were all out, and the county would make no appropriation so\nschool would have to close next week.\n\nWell that beats me!  I had faith in that prayer I was going to make,\nand here the very thing I intended to ask for happened before I prayed.\nI decided I would save the prayer until the next time I couldn't stand\nanything another minute, and then I would try it with all my might, and\nsee if it really did any good.  After supper I went out the back door,\nspread my arms wide, and ran down the orchard to the fence in great\nbounds, the fastest I ever went in my life.  I climbed my pulpit in the\ncorner and tried to see how much air my lungs would hold without\nbursting, while I waved my arms and shouted at the top of my voice:\n\"Praise ye the Lord!  Praised be His holy name!\"\n\n\"Ker-awk!\" cried an old blue heron among the cowslips below me.  I had\nalmost scared it to death, and it arose on flapping wings and paid me\nback by frightening me so I screamed as I dodged its shadow.\n\n\"What is all this?\" asked father behind me.\n\n\"Come up and take a seat, and I'll try to tell you,\" I said.\n\nSo he stepped on my pulpit and sat on the top rail, while I stood\nbetween his knees, put my arms around his neck, took off his hat and\nloosened his hair so the wind could wave it, and make his head feel\ncool and good.  His hair curled a little and it was black and fine.\nHis cheeks were pink and his eyes the brightest blue, with long lashes,\nand heavier brows than any other man I ever have seen.  He was the best\nlooking--always so clean and fresh, and you never had to be afraid of\nhim, unless you had been a bad, sinful child.  If you were all right,\nyou would walk into his arms, play with his hair, kiss him all you\npleased, and there wasn't a thing on earth you couldn't tell him,\nexcepting a secret you had promised to keep.\n\nSo I explained all this, and more too.  About how I wanted to hunt for\nthe flowers, to see which bloomed first, and watch in what order the\nbirds came, and now it was a splendid time to locate nests, because\nthere were no leaves, so I could see easily, and how glad mother would\nbe to know where the blue goose nested, and her white turkey hen;\nbecause she wanted her geese all blue, and the turkeys all white, as\nfast as she could manage.\n\nEvery little thing that troubled me or that I wanted, I told him.\n\nHe sat there and he couldn't have listened with more interest or been\nquieter if I had been a bishop, which is the biggest thing that ever\nhappened at our house; his name was Ninde and he came from Chicago to\ndedicate our church when it was new.  So father listened and thought\nand held his arms around me, and--\n\n\"And you think the Lord was at the bottom of the thing that makes you\nhappy?\"\n\n\"Well, you always go to Him about what concerns you, and you say,\n'Praise the Lord,' when things go to please you.\"\n\n\"I do indeed!\" said father.  \"But I had thought of this running short\nof school funds as a calamity.  If I had been praying about it, I would\nhave asked Him to show me a way to raise money to continue until middle\nMay at least.\"\n\n\"Oh father!\"\n\nI just crumpled up in his arms and began to cry; to save me I couldn't\nhelp it.  He held me tight.  At last he said:  \"I think you are a\nlittle overstrained this spring.  Maybe you were sicker than we knew,\nor are growing too fast.  Don't worry any more about school.  Possibly\nfather can fix it.\"\n\nNext morning when I wakened, my everyday clothes lay across the foot of\nthe bed, so I called mother and asked if I should put them on; she took\nme in her arms, and said father thought I had better be in the open,\nand I needn't go to school any more that spring.  I told her I thought\nI could bear it a few more days, now it was going to be over so soon;\nbut she said I might stay at home, father and Laddie would hear me at\nnight, and I could take my books anywhere I pleased and study when I\nchose, if I had my spelling and reading learned at evening.  NOW, say\nthe Lord doesn't help those who call on Him in faith believing!\n\nThink of being allowed to learn your lessons on the top of the granary,\nwhere you could look out of a window above the treetops, lie in the\ncool wind, and watch swallows and martins.  Think of studying in the\npulpit when the creek ran high, and the wild birds sang so sweetly you\nseemed to hear them for the first time in all your life, and hens,\nguineas, and turkeys made prime music in the orchard.  You could see\nthe buds swell, and the little blue flags push through the grass, where\nMrs. Mayer had her flowerbed, and the cowslips greening under the water\nof the swale at the foot of the hill, while there might be a Fairy\nunder any leaf.  I was so full, so swelled up and excited, that when I\ngot ready to pick up a book, I could learn a lesson in a few minutes,\ntell all about it, spell every word, and read it back, front, and\nsideways.  I never learned lessons so quick and so easy in all my life;\nfather, Laddie, and every one of them had to say so.  One night, father\nsaid to Laddie:  \"This child is furnishing evidence that our school\nsystem is wrong, and our methods of teaching far from right.\"\n\n\"Or is it merely proof that she is different,\" said Laddie, \"and you\ncan't run her through the same groove you could the rest of us?\"\n\n\"A little of both,\" said father, \"but most that the system is wrong.\nWe are not going at children in a way to gain and hold their interest,\nand make them love their work.  There must be a better way of teaching,\nand we should find different teachers.  You'll have to try the school\nnext year yourself, Laddie.\"\n\n\"I have a little plan about a piece of land I am hoping to take before\nthen,\" answered Laddie.  \"It's time for me to try my wings at making a\nliving, and land is my choice.  I have fully decided.  I stick to the\nsoil!\"\n\n\"Amen!\" cried father.  \"You please me mightily.  I hate to see sons of\nmine thriving on law, literally making their living out of the fruit of\nother men's discord.  I dislike seeing them sharpen their wits in\ntrade, buying at the lowest limit, extorting the highest.  I don't want\ntheir horizons limited by city blocks, their feet on pavements,\neverything under the sun in their heads that concerns a scheme to make\nmoney; not room for an hour's thought or study in a whole day, about\nthe really vital things of life.  After all, land and its products are\nthe basis of everything; the city couldn't exist a day unless we feed\nand clothe it.  In the things that I consider important, you are a king\namong men, with your feet on soil you own.\"\n\n\"So I figure it,\" said Laddie.\n\n\"And you are the best educated man I have reared,\" said father.  \"Take\nthis other thought with you: on land, the failure of the bank does not\nbreak you.  The fire another man's carelessness starts, does not wipe\nout your business or home.  You are not in easy reach of contagion.\nAny time you want to branch out, your mother and I will stand back of\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" said Laddie.  \"You backed none of the others.  They would\nresent it.  I'll make the best start I can myself, and as they did,\nstand alone.\"\n\nFather looked at him and smiled slowly.\n\n\"You are right, as always,\" he said.  \"I hadn't thought so far.  It\nwould make trouble.  At any rate, let me inspect and help you select\nyour land.\"\n\n\"That of course!\" said Laddie.\n\nI suspect it's not a very nice thing for me to tell, but all of us were\ntickled silly the day Miss Amelia packed her trunk and left for sure.\nMother said she never tried harder in all her days, but Miss Amelia was\nthe most distinctly unlovable person she ever had met.  She sympathized\nwith us so, she never said a word when Leon sang:\n\n  \"Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,\n    Which I gaze on so fondly to-day,\n  Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms,\n    Like fairy-gifts fading away,\n  Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art,\n    Let thy loveliness fade as it will,\n  And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart\n    Would entwine itself verdantly still--\"\n\nwhile Miss Amelia drove from sight up the Groveville road.\n\nAs he sang Leon stretched out his arms after her vanishing form.  \"I\nhope,\" he said, \"that you caught that touching reference to 'the dear\nruin,' and could anything be expressed more beautifully and poetically\nthan that 'verdantly still?'\"\n\nI feel sorry for a snake.  I like hoptoads, owls, and shitepokes.  I\nenvy a buzzard the way it can fly, and polecats are beautiful; but I\nnever could get up any sort of feeling at all for Miss Amelia, whether\nshe was birdlike or her true self.  So no one was any gladder than I\nwhen she was gone.\n\nAfter that, spring came pushing until you felt shoved.  Our family\nneeded me then.  If they never had known it before, they found out\nthere was none too many of us.  Every day I had to watch the blue\ngoose, and bring in her egg before it was chilled, carrying it\ncarefully so it would not be jarred.  I had to hunt the turkey nests\nand gather their eggs so they would be right for setting.  There had to\nbe straw carried from the stack for new nests, eggs marked, and hens\nset by the dozen.  Garden time came, so leaves had to be raked from the\nbeds and from the dooryard.  No one was busier than I; but every little\nwhile I ran away, and spent some time all by myself in the pulpit,\nunder the hawk oak, or on the roof.\n\nComing from church that Sunday, when we reached the top of the Big\nHill, mother touched father's arm.  \"Stop a minute,\" she said, and he\nchecked the horses, while we sat there and wondered why, as she looked\nand looked all over the farm, then, \"Now drive to the top of the Little\nHill and turn, and stop exactly on the place from which we first viewed\nthis land together,\" she said.  \"You know the spot, don't you?\"\n\n\"You may well believe I know it,\" said father.  \"I can hit it to the\ninch.  You see, children,\" he went on, \"your mother and I arranged\nbefore the words were said over us\"--he always put it that way--I never\nin my life heard him say, \"when we were married\"; he read so many books\nhe talked exactly like a book--\"that we would be partners in\neverything, as long as we lived.  When we decided the Ohio land was not\nquite what we wanted, she sent me farther west to prospect, while she\nstayed at home and kept the baby.  When I reached this land, found it\nfor sale, and within my means, I bought it, and started home happy.\nBefore I'd gone a mile, I turned to look back, and saw that it was\nhilly, mostly woods, and there was no computing the amount of work it\nwould require to make it what I could see in it; so I began to think\nmaybe she wouldn't like it, and to wish I had brought her, before I\nclosed the deal.  By the time I returned home, packed up, and travelled\nthis far on the way back with her, there was considerable tension in my\nfeelings--considerable tension,\" repeated father as he turned the\nhorses and began driving carefully, measuring the distance from Hoods'\nand the bridge.  At last he stopped, backed a step, and said:  \"There,\nmommy, did I hit the spot?\"\n\n\"You did!\" said mother, stepping from the carriage and walking up\nbeside him.  She raised one hand and laid it on the lamp near him.  He\nshifted the lines, picked up her hand, and held it tight.  Mother stood\nthere looking, just silently looking.  May jabbed me in the side,\nleaned over and whispered:\n\n  \"Could we but stand where Moses stood,\n    And view the landscape o'er,\n  Not our Little Creek, nor dinner getting cold,\n    Could fright us from that shore.\"\n\n\nI couldn't help giggling, but I knew that was no proper time, so I hid\nmy head in her lap and smothered the sound the best I could; but they\nwere so busy soft-soddering each other they didn't pay a bit of\nattention to us.\n\nIt was May now, all the leaves were fresh and dustless, everything that\nflowered at that time was weighted with bloom, bees hummed past,\nbutterflies sailed through the carriage, while birds at the tops of\ntheir voices, all of them, every kind there was, sang fit to split;\nfriendly, unafraid bluebirds darted around us, and talked a blue streak\nfrom every fence rider.  Made you almost crazy to know what they said.\nThe Little Creek flowed at our feet across the road, through the\nblue-flag swamp, where the red and the yellow birds lived.  You could\nsee the sun flash on the water where it emptied into the stream that\ncrossed Deams', and flowed through our pasture; and away beyond the Big\nHill arose, with the new church on top, the graveyard around it, the\nBig Creek flashing at its base.  In the valley between lay our fields,\nmeadows, the big red barn, the white house with the yard filled with\ntrees and flowering shrubs, beyond it the garden, all made up, neat and\ngrowing; and back of it the orchard in full bloom.\n\nMother looked and looked.  Suddenly she raised her face to father.\n\"Paul,\" she said, \"that first day, did you ever dream it could be made\nto look like this?\"\n\n\"No!\" said father.  \"I never did!  I saw houses, barns, and cleared\nfields; I hoped for comfort and prosperity, but I didn't know any place\ncould grow to be so beautiful, and there is something about it, even on\na rainy November day, there is something that catches me in the breast,\non the top of either of these hills, until it almost stifles me.  What\nis it, Ruth?\"\n\n\"The Home Feeling!\" said mother.  \"It is in my heart so big this\nmorning I am filled with worship.  Just filled with the spirit of\nworship.\"\n\nShe was rocking on her toes like she does when she becomes too happy at\nthe Meeting House to be quiet any longer, and cries, \"Glory!\" right out\nloud.  She pointed to the orchard, an immense orchard of big apple\ntrees in full bloom, with two rows of peach trees around the sides.  It\nlooked like a great, soft, pinkish white blanket, with a deep pink\nborder, spread lightly on the green earth.\n\n\"We planted that way because we thought it was best; how could we know\nhow it would look in bloom time?  It seems as if you came to these\nhilltops and figured on the picture you would make before you cleared,\nor fenced a field.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I did,\" said father.  \"Many's the hour, all told,\nthat I have stopped my horse on one of these hilltops and studied how\nto make the place beautiful, as well as productive.  That was a task\nyou set me, my girl.  You always considered BEAUTY as well as USE about\nthe house and garden, and wherever you worked.  I had to hold my part\nin line.\"\n\n\"You have made it all a garden,\" said mother.  \"You have made it a\ngarden growing under the smile of the Master; a very garden of the\nLord, father.\"\n\nFather drew up her hand and held it tight against his heart.\n\n\"Your praise is sweet, my girl, sweet!\" he said.  \"I have tried, God\nknows I have tried, to make it first comfortable, then beautiful, for\nall of us.  To the depths of my soul I thank Him for this hour.  I am\nglad, Oh I am so glad you like your home, Ruth!  I couldn't endure it\nif you complained, found fault and wished you lived elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Why, father!\" said my mother in the most surprised voice.  \"Why,\nfather, it would kill me to leave here.  This is ours.  We have made it\nby and through the strength of the Lord and our love for each other.\nAll my days I want to live here, and when I die, I want to lie beside\nmy blessed babies and you, Paul, down by the church we gave the land\nfor, and worked so hard to build.  I love it, Oh I love it!  See how\nclean and white the dark evergreens make the house look!  See how the\nbig chestnuts fit in and point out the yellow road.  I wish we had a\nrow the length of it!\"\n\n\"They wouldn't grow,\" said father.  \"You mind the time I had finding\nthe place those wanted to set their feet?\"\n\n\"I do indeed!\" said mother, drawing her hand and his with it where she\ncould rub her cheek against it.  \"Now we'll go home and have our dinner\nand a good rest.  I'm a happy woman this day, father, a happy, happy\nwoman.  If only one thing didn't worry me----\"\n\n\"Must there always be a 'fly in the ointment,' mother?\"\n\nShe looked at him with a smile that was like a hug and kiss, and she\nsaid:  \"I have found it so, father, and I have been happy in spite of\nit.  Where one has such wide interests, at some point there is always a\npull, but in His own day, in His own way, the Lord is going to make\neverything right.\"\n\n\"'Thy faith hath made thee whole,'\" quoted father.\n\nThen she stepped into the carriage, and he waited a second, quite long\nenough to let her see that he was perfectly willing to sit there all\nday if she wanted him to, and then he slowly and carefully drove home,\nas he always did when she was in the carriage.  Times when he had us\nchildren out alone, he went until you couldn't see the spokes in the\nwheels.  He just loved to \"speed up\" once in a while on a piece of fine\nroad to let us know how going fast felt.\n\nMother sat there trembling a little, smiling, misty-eyed.  I was\nthinking, for I knew what the \"fly in the ointment\" was.  She had a\nletter from Shelley yesterday, and she said there wasn't a reason on\nearth why father or Laddie should spend money to come to Chicago, she\nwould soon be home, she was counting the hours, and she never wanted to\nleave again.  In the start she didn't want to go at all, unless she\ncould stay three years, at the very least.  Of course it was that\ndreadful man, who had made her so beautiful and happy, and then taken\naway all the joy; how COULD a man do it?  It was the hardest thing to\nunderstand.\n\nNext morning mother was feeling fine, the world was lovely, Miss Amelia\nwas gone, May was home to help, so she began housecleaning by washing\nall the curtains.  She had been in the kitchen to show Candace how.  I\nhad all my work done, and was making friends with a robin brooding in\nmy very own catalpa tree, when Mr. Pryor rode up, tied his horse, and\nstarted toward the gate.  I knew he and father had quarrelled; that is,\nfather had told him he couldn't say \"God was a myth\" in this house, and\nhe'd gone home mad as hops; so I knew it would be something mighty\nimportant that was bringing him back.  I slid from the tree, ran and\nopened the gate, and led the way up the walk.  I opened the front door\nand asked him in, and then I did the wrong thing.  I should have taken\nhis hat, told him to be seated, and said I would see if I could find\nfather; I knew what to do, and how to do it, but because of that about\nGod, I was so excited I made a mistake.  I never took his hat, or\noffered him a chair; I just bolted into the dining-room, looking for\nfather or mother, and left the door wide open, so he thought that\nwasn't the place to sit, because I didn't give him a chair, and he\nfollowed me.  The instant I saw mother's face, I knew what I had done.\nThe dining-room was no place for particular company like him, and\nbringing him in that way didn't give her time to smooth her hair, pull\nshut her dress band at the neck, put on her collar, and shiny goldstone\npin, her white apron, and rub her little flannel rag, with rice flour\non it, on her nose to take away the shine.  I had made a mess of it.\n\nThere she came right in the door, just as she was from the tub.  Her\nhair was damp and crinkled around her face, her neckband had been close\nin stooping, so she had unfastened it, and tucked it back in a little\nV-shaped place to give her room and air.  Her cheeks were pink, her\neyes bright, her lips red as a girl's, and her neck was soft and white.\nThe V-shaped place showed a little spot like baby skin, right where her\nneck went into her chest.  Sure as father kissed her lips, he always\ntipped back her head, bent lower and kissed that spot too.  I had seen\nhundreds of them go there, and I had tried it myself, lots of times,\nand it WAS the sweetest place.  Seeing what I had done, I stopped\nbreathless.  You have to beat most everything you teach a child right\ninto it properly to keep it from making such a botch of things as that.\nI hardly dared to peep at mother, but when I did, she took my breath\nworse than the mistake I had made.\n\nCaught, she stood her ground.  She never paused a second.  Straight to\nhim she went, holding out her hand, and I could see that it was red and\nwarm from pressing the lace in the hot suds.  A something flashed over\nher, that made her more beautiful than she was in her silk dress going\nto town to help Lucy give a party, and her voice was sweet as the\nbubbling warbler on the garden fence when he was trying to coax a mate\ninto the privet bush to nest.\n\nMother asked him to be seated, so he took one of the chairs nearest\nhim, and sat holding his hat in one hand, his whip in the other.\nMother drew a chair beside the dining table, dropped her hands on each\nother, and looking in his eyes, she smiled at him.  I tell the same\nthing over about people's looks, but I haven't told of this smile of\nmother's; because I never saw exactly how it was, or what it would do\nto people, until that morning.  Then as I watched her--for how she felt\ndecided what would happen to me, after Mr. Pryor was gone I saw\nsomething I never had noticed until that minute.  She could laugh all\nover her face, before her lips parted until her teeth showed.  She was\ndoing it now.  With a wide smile running from cheek to cheek, pushing\nup a big dimple at each end, her lips barely touching, her eyes\ndancing, she sat looking at him.\n\n\"This IS the most blessed season for warming up the heart,\" she said.\n\"If you want the half of my kingdom, ask quickly.  I'm in the mood to\nbestow it.\"\n\nHow she laughed!  He just had to loosen up a little, and smile back,\neven though it looked pretty stiff.\n\n\"Well, I'll not tax you so far,\" he said.  \"I only want Mr. Stanton.\"\n\n\"But he is the whole of the kingdom, and the King to boot!\" she\nlaughed, dimpled, and flamed redder.\n\nMr. Pryor stared at her wonderingly.  You could even see the wonder,\nlike it was something you could take hold of.  I suppose he wondered\nwhat could make a woman so happy, like that.\n\n\"Lucky man!\" he said.  \"All of us are not so fortunate.\"\n\n\"Then it must be you don't covet the place or the title,\" said mother\nmore soberly.  \"Any woman will crown the man she marries, if he will\nallow her.  Paul went farther.  He compelled it.\"\n\n\"I wonder how!\" said Mr. Pryor, his eyes steadily watching mother's\nface.\n\n\"By never failing in a million little things, that taken as a whole,\nmake up one mighty big thing, on which he stands like the Rock of Ages.\"\n\n\"Yet they tell me that you are the mother of twelve children,\" he said,\nas if he marvelled at something.\n\n\"Yes!\" cried mother, and the word broke right through a bubbling laugh.\n\"Am I not fortunate above most women?  We had the grief to lose two\nlittle daughters at the ages of eight and nine, all the others I have,\nand I rejoice in them.\"\n\nShe reached out, laid a hand on me, drew me to her, and lightly touched\nmy arm, sending my spirits sky-high.  She wasn't going to do a thing to\nme, not even scold!  Mr. Pryor stared at her like Jacob Hood does at\nLaddie when he begins rolling Greek before him, so I guess what mother\nsaid must have been Greek to Mr. Pryor.\n\n\"I came to see Mr. Stanton,\" he said suddenly, and crosslike as if he\ndidn't believe a word she said, and had decided she was too foolish to\nbother with any longer; but he kept on staring.  He couldn't quit that,\nno matter how cross he was.  The funniest thing came into my mind.  I\nwondered what on earth he'd have done if she'd gone over, sat on his\nlap, put her arms around his neck, took his face between her hands and\nkissed his forehead, eyes, lips, and tousled his hair, like she does\nfather and our boys.  I'll bet all I got, he'd have turned to stonier\nstone than Sabethany.  You could see that no one ever served HIM like\nthat in all his old, cold, hard, cross, mysterious, shut-in life.  I\nwas crazy to ask, \"Say, did anybody ever kiss you?\" but I had such a\nclose escape bringing him in wrong, I thought it would be wise not to\ntake any risks so soon after.  It was enough to stand beside mother,\nand hear every word they said.  What was more, she wanted me, because\nshe kept her hand on mine, or touched my apron every little while.\n\n\"I'm so sorry!\" she said.  \"He was called to town on business.  The\nCounty Commissioners are sitting to-day.\"\n\n\"They are deciding about the Groveville bridge, and pike?\"\n\n\"Yes.  He is working so hard for them.\"\n\n\"The devil you say!  I beg pardon!  But it was about that I came.  I'm\nthree miles from there, and I'm taxed over sixty pounds for it.\"\n\n\"But you cross the bridge every time you go to town, and travel the\nroad.  Groveville is quite a resort on account of the water and lovely\ncountry.  Paul is very anxious to have the work completed before the\nsummer boarders come from surrounding cities.  We are even farther from\nit than you; but it will cost us as much.\"\n\n\"Are you insane?\" cried Mr. Pryor, not at all politely; but you could\nsee that mother was bound she wouldn't become provoked about anything,\nfor she never stopped a steady beam on him.  \"Spend all that money for\nstrangers to lazy around on a few weeks and then go!\"\n\n\"But a good bridge and fine road will add to their pleasure, and when\nthey leave, the improvements remain.  They will benefit us and our\nchildren through all the years to come.\"\n\n\"Talk about 'the land of the free'!\" cried Mr. Pryor.  \"This is a\ntax-ridden nation.  It's a beastly outrage!  Ever since I came, it's\nbeen nothing but notice of one assessment after another.  I won't pay\nit!  I won't endure it.  I'll move!\"\n\nMother let go of me, gripped her hands pretty tight together on the\ntable, and she began to talk.\n\n\"As for freedom--no man ever was, or is, or will be free,\" she said,\nquite as forcibly as he could speak.  \"You probably knew when you came\nhere that you would find a land tax-ridden from a great civil war of\nyears' duration, and from newness of vast territory to be opened up and\nimproved.  You certainly studied the situation.\"\n\n\"'Studied the situation'!\"  His whip beat across his knee.  \"'Studied\nthe situation'!  My leaving England was--er--the result of intolerable\nconditions there--in the nature of flight from things not to be\nendured.  I had only a vague idea of the States.\"\n\n\"If England is intolerable, and the United States an outrage, I don't\nknow where in this world you'll go,\" said mother softly.\n\nMr. Pryor stared at her sharply.\n\n\"Madame is pleased to be facetious,\" he said sneeringly.\n\nMother's hands parted, and one of them stretched across the table\ntoward him.\n\n\"Forgive me!\" she cried.  \"That was unkind.  I know you are in dreadful\ntrouble.  I'd give--I'd almost give this right hand to comfort you.\nI'd do nearly anything to make you feel that you need bear no burden\nalone; that we'd love to help support you.\"\n\n\"I believe you would,\" he said slowly, his eyes watching her again.  \"I\nbelieve you would.  I wonder why!\"\n\n\"All men are brothers, in the broader sense,\" said mother, \"and if\nyou'll forgive me, your face bears marks of suffering almost amounting\nto torture.\"\n\nShe stretched out the other hand.\n\n\"You couldn't possibly let us help you?\"\n\nSlowly he shook his head.\n\n\"Think again!\" urged mother.  \"A trouble shared is half over to start\nwith.  You lay a part of it on your neighbours, and your neighbours in\nthis case would be glad, glad indeed, to see you care-free and happy as\nall men should be.\"\n\n\"We'll not discuss it,\" he said.  \"You can't possibly imagine the root\nof my trouble.\"\n\n\"I shan't try!\" said mother.  \"But let me tell you this:  I don't care\nif you have betrayed your country, blasphemed your God, or killed your\nown child!  So long, as you're a living man, daily a picture of\nsuffering before me, you're a burden on my heart.  You're a load on my\nshoulders, without your consent.  I have implored God, I shall never\ncease to implore Him, until your brow clears, your head is lifted, and\nyour heart is at rest.  You can't prevent me!  This hour I shall go to\nmy closet and beg Him to have mercy on your poor soul, and when His\ntime comes, He will.  You can't help yourself, or you would have done\nso, long ago.  You must accept aid!  This must end, or there will be\ntragedy in your house.\"\n\n\"Madame, there has been!\" said Mr. Pryor, shaking as he sat.\n\n\"I recognize that,\" said mother.  \"The question is whether what has\npassed is not enough.\"\n\n\"You simply cannot understand!\" he said.\n\n\"Mr. Pryor,\" she said, \"you're in the position of a man doubly bereft.\nYou are without a country, and without a God.  Your face tells every\npasser-by how you are enjoying that kind of life.  Forgive me, if I\nspeak plainly.  I admire some things about you so much, I am venturing\npositive unkindness to try to make you see that in shutting out your\nneighbours you will surely make them think more, and worse things, than\nare true.  I haven't a doubt in my mind but that your trouble is not\none half so dreadful as you imagine while brooding over it.  We will\npass that.  Let me tell you how we feel about this road matter.  You\nsee we did our courting in Pennsylvania, married and tried Ohio, and\nthen came on here.  We took this land when it was mostly woods.  I\ncould point you to the exact spot where we stopped; we visited it\nyesterday, looked down the hill and selected the place where we would\nset this house, when we could afford to build it.  We moved into the\ncabin that was on the land first, later built a larger one, and finally\nthis home as we had planned it.  Every fruit tree, bush, vine, and\nflower we planted.  Here our children have been born, lived, loved, and\nleft us; some for the graveyard down yonder, some for homes of their\nown.  Always we have planned and striven to transform this into the\ndearest, the most beautiful spot on earth.  In making our home the best\nwe can, in improving our township, county, and state, we are doing our\nshare toward upbuilding this nation.\"\n\nShe began at the a b c's, and gave it to him straight: the whole thing,\njust as we saw it; and he listened, as if he were a prisoner, and she a\njudge telling him what he must do to gain his freedom.  She put in the\nbirds to keep away the worms, the trees to break the wind, the creeks\nto save the moisture.  She whanged him, and she banged him, up one\nside, and down the other.  She didn't stop to be mincy.  She shot\nthings at him like a man talking to another man who had plenty of sense\nbut not a particle of reason.  She gave him the reason.  She told him\nexactly why, and how, and where, and also just WHAT he must do to feel\nRIGHT toward his neighbours, his family, and his God.  No preacher ever\ntalked half so well.  Yea verily, she was as interesting as the Bishop\nhimself, and far pleasanter to look at.  When she ran short of breath,\nand out of words, she reached both hands toward him again.\n\n\"OH DO PLEASE THINK OF THESE THINGS!\" she begged.  \"Do try to believe\nthat I am a sensible person, and know what I am talking about.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Mr. Pryor, \"there's no doubt in my mind but you are the\nmost wonderful woman I ever have met.  Surely I believe you!  Surely I\nknow your plan of life is the true, the only right way.  It is one\ndegree added to my humiliation that the ban I am under keeps me from\nfriendly intercourse with so great a lady.\"\n\n\"'Lady'?\" said my mother, her eyes widening.  \"'Lady'?  Now it is you\nwho are amused.\"\n\n\"I don't understand!\" he said.  \"Certainly you are a lady, a very great\nlady.\"\n\n\"Goodness, gracious me!\" cried my mother, laughing until her dimples\nwould have held water.  \"That's the first time in all my life I was\never accused of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Again, I do not comprehend,\" said Mr. Pryor, as if vexed about all he\nwould endure.\n\nMother laughed on, and as she did so she drew back her hands and\nstudied them.  Then she looked at him again, one pink dimple flashing\nhere and there, all over her face.\n\n\"Well, to begin at the root of the matter,\" she said, \"that is an\nenormous big word that you are using lightly.  Any one in petticoats is\nnot a lady--by no means!  A lady must be born of unsullied blood for at\nleast three generations, on each side of her house.  Think for a minute\nabout where you are going to fulfil that condition.  Then she must be\ngentle by nature, and rearing.  She must know all there is to learn\nfrom books, have wide experience to cover all emergencies, she must be\nsteeped in social graces, and diplomatic by nature.  She must rise\nunruffled to any emergency, never wound, never offend, always help and\nheal, she must be perfect in deportment, virtue, wifehood and\nmotherhood.  She must be graceful, pleasing and beautiful.  She must\nhave much leisure to perfect herself in learning, graces and arts----\"\n\n\"Madame, you draw an impossible picture!\" cried Mr. Pryor.\n\n\"I draw the picture of the only woman on earth truly entitled to be\ncalled a lady.  You use a good word lightly.  I have told you what it\ntakes to make a lady--now look at me!\"\n\nHow she laughed! Mr. Pryor looked, but he didn't laugh.\n\n\"More than ever you convince me that you are a lady, indeed,\" he said.\n\nMother wiped her eyes.\n\n\"My dear man!\" she cried, \"I'm the daughter of a Dutch miller, who\nlived on a Pennsylvania mountain stream.  There never was a school\nanywhere near us, and father and mother only taught us to work.  Paul\nStanton took a grist there, and saw me.  He married me, and brought me\nhere.  He taught me to read and write.  I learned my lessons with my\nelder children.  He has always kept school in our house, every night of\nhis life.  Our children supposed it was for them; I knew it was quite\nas much for me.  While I sat at knitting or sewing, I spelled over the\nwords he gave out.  I know nothing of my ancestors, save that they came\nfrom the lowlands of Holland, down where there were cities, schools,\nand business.  They were well educated, but they would not take the\ntrouble to teach their children.  As I have spoken to you, my husband\ntaught me.  All I know I learn from him, from what he reads aloud, and\nplaces he takes me.  I exist in a twenty-mile radius, but through him,\nI know all lands, principalities and kingdoms, peoples and customs.  I\nneed never be ashamed to go, or afraid to speak, anywhere.\"\n\n\"Indeed not!\" cried Mr. Pryor.\n\n\"But when you think on the essentials of a real lady--and then picture\nme patching, with a First Reader propped before me; facing Indians,\nGypsies, wild animals--and they used to be bad enough--why, I mind one\ntime in Ohio when our first baby was only able to stand beside a chair,\nand through the rough puncheon floor a copperhead stuck up its gleam of\nbronzy gold, and shot its darting tongue within a foot of her bare leg.\nBy all accounts, a lady would have reached for her smelling salts and\ngracefully fainted away; in fact, a lady never would have been in such\na place at all.  It was my job to throw the first thing I could lay my\nhands on so straight and true that I would break that snake's neck, and\nsend its deadly fangs away from my baby.  I did it with Paul's plane,\nand neatly too!  Then I had to put the baby on the bed and tear up\nevery piece of the floor to see that the snake had not a mate in hiding\nthere, for copperheads at that season were going pairs.  Once I was\ndriven to face a big squaw, and threatened the life of her baby with a\nred-hot poker while she menaced mine with a hunting knife.  There is\nnot one cold, rough, hard experience of pioneer life that I have not\nendured.  Shoulder to shoulder, and heart to heart, I've stood beside\nmy man, and done what had to be done, to build this home, rear our\nchildren, save our property.  Many's the night I have shivered in a\nbarn doctoring sick cattle and horses we could ill afford to lose.\nTime and again I have hung on and brought things out alive, after the\nmen gave up and quit.  A lady?  How funny!\"\n\n\"The amusement is all on your part, Madame.\"\n\n\"So it seems!\" said mother.  \"But you see, I know so well how\nridiculous it is.  When I think of the life a woman must lead in order\nto be truly a lady, when I review the life I have been forced to live\nto do my share in making this home, and rearing these children, the\ncontrast is too great.  I thank God for any part I have been able to\ntake.  Had I life to live over, I see now where I could do more; but\nneighbour, believe me, my highest aspiration is to be a clean, thrifty\nhousekeeper, a bountiful cook, a faithful wife, a sympathetic mother.\nThat is life work for any woman, and to be a good woman is the greatest\nthing on earth.  Never mind about the ladies; if you can honestly say\nof me, she is a good woman, you have paid me the highest possible\ntribute.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to change, in the face of your argument,\" said Mr.\nPryor.  \"Our loved Queen on her throne is no finer lady.\"\n\nThat time mother didn't laugh.  She looked straight at him a minute and\nthen she said:  \"Well, for an Englishman, as I know them, you have said\nthe last word.  Higher praise there is none.  But believe me, I make no\nsuch claim.  To be a good wife and mother is the end toward which I\naspire.  To hold the respect and love of my husband is the greatest\nobject of my life.\"\n\n\"Then you have succeeded.  You stand a monument to wifehood; your\nchildren prove your idea of motherhood,\" said Mr. Pryor.  \"How in this\nworld have you managed it?  The members of your family whom I have seen\nare fine, interesting men and women, educated above the average.  It is\nnot idle curiosity.  I am deeply interested in knowing how such an end\ncame to be accomplished here on this farm.  I wish you would tell me\njust how you have gone about schooling your children.\"\n\n\"By educating ourselves before their coming, and with them afterward.\nSelf-control, study, work, joy of life, satisfaction with what we have\nhad, never-ending strife to go higher, and to do better--Dr. Fenner\nlaughs when I talk of these things.  He says he can take a little naked\nHottentot from the jungle, and educate it to the same degree that I can\none of mine.  I don't know; but if these things do not help before\nbirth, at least they do not hinder; and afterward, you are in the\ngroove in which you want your children to run.  With all our twelve\nthere never has been one who at nine months of age did not stop crying\nif its father lifted his finger, or tapped his foot and told it to.\nFrom the start we have rigorously guarded our speech and actions before\nthem.  From the first tiny baby my husband has taught all of them to\nread, write and cipher some, before they went to school at all.  He is\nalways watching, observing, studying: the earth, the stars, growing\nthings; he never comes to a meal but he has seen something that he has\nor will study out for all of us.  There never has been one day in our\nhome on which he did not read a new interesting article from book or\npaper; work out a big problem, or discuss some phase of politics,\nreligion, or war.  Sometimes there has been a little of all of it in\none day, always reading, spelling, and memory exercises at night.  He\nhas a sister who twice in her life has repeated the Bible as a test\nbefore a committee.  He, himself, can go through the New Testament and\nall of the Old save the books of the generations.  He always says he\nconsiders it a waste of gray matter to learn them.  He has been a\nschoolmaster, his home his schoolroom, his children, wife and helpers\nhis pupils; the common things of life as he meets them every day, the\nbooks from which we learn.\n\n\"I was ignorant at first of bookish subjects, but in his atmosphere, if\none were no student, and didn't even try to keep up, or forge ahead,\nthey would absorb much through association.  Almost always he has been\non the school board and selected the teachers; we have made a point of\nkeeping them here, at great inconvenience to ourselves, in order to\nknow as much of them as possible, and to help and guide them in their\nwork.  When the children could learn no more here, for most of them we\nhave managed the high school of Groveville, especially after our\ndaughter moved there, and for each of them we have added at least two\nyears of college, music school, or whatever the peculiar bent of the\nchild seemed to demand.\n\n\"Before any daughter has left our home for one of her own, she has been\ntaught all I know of cleanliness about a house, cookery, sewing,\ntending the sick, bathing and dressing the new born.  She has to bake\nbread, pie, cake, and cook any meat or vegetable we have.  She has had\nher bolt of muslin to make as she chose for her bedding, and linen for\nher underclothing.  The quilts she pieced and the blankets she wove\nhave been hers.  All of them have been as well provided for as we could\nafford.  They can knit, darn, patch, tuck, hem, and embroider, set a\nhen and plant a garden.  I go on a vacation and leave each of them to\nkeep house for her father a month, before she enters a home of her own.\nThey are strong, healthy girls; I hope all of them are making a good\nshowing at being useful women, and I know they are happy, so far at\nleast.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" said Mr. Pryor.\n\n\"Father takes the boys in hand and they must graduate in a straight\nfurrow, an even fence, planting and tending crops, trimming and\ngrafting trees, caring for stock, and handling plane, auger and chisel.\nEach one must select his wood, cure, fashion, and fit his own ax with a\nhandle, grind and swing it properly, as well as cradle, scythe and\nsickle.  They must be able to select good seed grain, boil sap, and\ncure meat.  They must know animals, their diseases and treatment, and\nwhen they have mastered all he can teach them, and done each thing\nproperly, they may go for their term at college, and make their choice\nof a profession.  As yet I'm sorry to say but one of them has come back\nto the land.\"\n\n\"You mean Laddie?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He has decided to be a farmer?\"\n\n\"He is determined to make the soil yield his living.\"\n\n\"I am sorry--sorry indeed to hear it,\" said Mr. Pryor.  \"He has brain\nand education to make a brilliant figure at law or statesmanship; he\nwould do well in trade.\"\n\n\"What makes you think he would not do well on land?\"\n\n\"Wasted!\" cried Mr. Pryor.  \"He would be wasted!\"\n\n\"Hold a bit!\" said mother, her face flushing as it did when she was\nvery provoked.  \"My husband is, and always has been, on land.  He is\nfar from being wasted.  He is a power in this community.  He has sons\nin cities in law and in trade.  Not one of them has the friends, and\nthe influence on his time, that his father has.  Any day he says the\nword, he can stand in legislative halls, and take any part he chooses\nin politics.  He prefers his home and family, and the work he does\nhere, but let me tell you, no son of his ever had his influence or\nopportunity, or ever will have.\"\n\n\"All this is news to me,\" said Mr. Pryor.\n\n\"You didn't expect us to come over, force our way in and tell you?\"\n\nIt was his turn to blush and he did.\n\n\"Laddie has been at our house often,\" he said.  \"He might have\nmentioned----\"\n\nMother laughed.  She was the gayest that morning.\n\n\"He 'might,' but he never would.  Neither would I if you hadn't seemed\nto think that the men who do the things Mr. Stanton REFUSES to do are\nthe ones worth while.\"\n\n\"He could accomplish much in legislative halls.\"\n\n\"He figures in the large.  He thinks that to be a commissioner, travel\nhis county and make all of it the best possible, to stand in primaries\nand choose only worthy men for all offices, is doing a much bigger work\nthan to take one place for himself, and strive only for that.  Besides,\nhe really loves his land, his house, and family.  He says no man has a\nright to bring twelve children into the world and not see personally to\nrearing and educating them.  He thinks the farm and the children too\nmuch for me, and he's sure he is doing the biggest thing for the\ncommunity at large, to go on as he does.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" said Mr. Pryor slowly.  \"He should know best.  Perhaps he\nis.\"\n\n\"I make no doubt!\" said mother, lifting her head proudly.  \"And as\nLaddie feels and has fitted himself, I look to see him go head and\nshoulders above any other son I have.  Trade is not the only way to\naccumulate.  Law is not the only path to the legislature.  Comfort,\nindependence, and freedom, such as we know here, is not found in any\ncity I ever have visited.  We think we have the best of life, and we\nare content on land.  We have not accumulated much money; we have spent\nthousands; we have had a big family for which to provide, and on\naccount of the newness of the country, taxes always have been heavy.\nBut we make no complaint.  We are satisfied.  We could have branched\noff into fifty different things after we had a fair start here.  We\ndidn't, because we preferred life as we worked it out for ourselves.\nPaul says when he leaves the city, and his horses' hoofs strike the\nroad between our fields, he always lifts his head higher, squares his\nshoulders, and feels a man among men.  To own land, and to love it, is\na wonderful thing, Mr. Pryor.\"\n\nShe made me think of something.  Ever since I had added to my quill and\narrow money, the great big lot at Easter, father had shared his chest\ntill with me.  The chest stood in our room, and in it lay his wedding\nsuit, his every Sunday clothes, his best hat with a red silk\nhandkerchief in the crown, a bundle of precious newspapers he was\nsaving on account of rare things in them he wanted for reference, and\nin the till was the wallet of ready money he kept in the house for\nunexpected expense, his deeds, insurance papers, all his particular\nprivate papers, the bunches of lead pencils, slate pencils, and the box\nof pens from which he supplied us for school.  Since I had grown so\nrich, he had gone partners with me, and I might lift the lid, open the\ntill and take out my little purse that May bought from the huckster for\nmy last birthday.  I wasn't to touch a thing, save my own, and I never\ndid; but I knew precious well what was there.\n\nIf Mr. Pryor thought my father didn't amount to much because he lived\non land; if it made him think more of him, to know that he could be in\nthe legislature if he chose, maybe he'd think still more----\n\nI lifted the papers, picked it up carefully, and slipping back quietly,\nI laid it on Mr. Pryor's knee.  He picked it up and held it a minute,\nuntil he finished what he was saying to mother, and then he looked at\nit.  Then he looked long and hard.  Then he straightened up and looked\nagain.\n\n\"God bless my soul!\" he cried.\n\nYou see when he was so astonished he didn't know what he was saying, he\ncalled on God, just as father says every one does.  I took a side look\nat mother.  Her face was a little extra flushed, but she was still\nsmiling; so I knew she wasn't angry with me, though of course she\nwouldn't have shown the thing herself.  She and father never did,\nexcept as each of us grew big enough to be taught about the Crusaders.\nFather said he didn't care the snap of his finger about it, except as\nit stood for hardihood and bravery.  But Mr. Pryor cared!  He cared\nmore than he could say.  He stared, and stared, and over and over he\nwonderingly repeated:\n\n\"God bless my soul!\"\n\n\"Where did you get the crest of the Earl of Eastbrooke, the master of\nStanton house?\" he demanded.  \"Stanton house!\" he repeated.  \"Why--why,\nthe name!  It's scarcely possible, but----\"\n\n\"But there it is!\" laughed mother.  \"A mere bauble for show and\namounting to nothing on earth save as it stands a mark for brave men\nwho have striven to conquer.\"\n\n\"Surgere tento!\" read Mr. Pryor, from the little shield.  \"Four shells!\nMadame, I know men who would give their lives to own this, and to have\nbeen born with the right to wear it.  It came to your husband in\nstraight line?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said mother, \"but generations back.  He never wore it.  He never\nwould.  He only saves it for the children.\"\n\n\"It goes to your eldest son?\"\n\n\"By rights, I suppose it should,\" said mother.  \"But father mentioned\nit the other night.  He said none of his boys had gone as he tried to\ninfluence them, unless Laddie does now in choosing land for his future,\nand if he does, his father is inclined to leave it to him, and I agree.\nAt our death it goes to Laddie I am quite sure.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope--I hope,\" said Mr. Pryor, \"that the young man has the wit\nto understand what this would mean to him in England.\"\n\n\"His wit is just about level with his father's,\" said mother.  \"He\nnever has been in England, and most probably he never will be.  I don't\nthink it means a rap more to Laddie than it does to my husband.  Laddie\nis so busy developing the manhood born in him, he has no time to chase\nthe rainbow of reflected glory, and no belief in its stability if he\nwalked in its light.  The child of my family to whom that trinket\nreally means something is Little Sister, here.  When Leon came in with\nthe thief, I thought he should have it; but after all, she is the\nstaunchest little Crusader I have.\"\n\nMr. Pryor looked me over with much interest.\n\n\"Yes, yes!  No doubt!\" he said.  \"But the male line!  This priceless\ntreasure should descend to one of the male line!  To one whose name\nwill remain Stanton!  To Laddie would be best, no doubt!  No doubt at\nall!\"\n\n\"We will think about it,\" said mother serenely as Mr. Pryor arose to go.\n\nHe apologized for staying so long, and mother said it hadn't been long,\nand asked him the nicest ever to come again.  She walked in the\nsunlight with him and pointed out the chestnuts.  She asked what he\nthought of a line of trees to shade the road, and they discussed\nwhether the pleasure they would give in summer would pay for the\ndampness they would hold in winter.  They wandered around the yard and\ninto the garden.  She sent me to bring a knife, trowel, and paper, so\nwhen he started for home, he was carrying a load of cuttings, and roots\nto plant.\n\nWhen father came from town that evening, at the first sight of him, she\nwent straight into his arms, her face beaming; she had been like a sun\nall that day.  Some of it must have been joy carried over from\nyesterday.\n\n\"Praise God, the wedge is in!\" she cried.\n\nFather held her tight, stroked her hair, and began smiling without\nhaving the least idea why, but he very well knew that whatever pleased\nher like that was going to be good news for him also.\n\n\"What has happened, mother?\" he asked.\n\n\"Mr. Pryor came over about the road and bridge tax, and oh Paul!  I've\nsaid every word to him I've been bursting to say from the very start.\nEvery single word, Paul!\"\n\n\"How did he take it?\"\n\n\"Time will tell.  Anyway, he heard it, all of it, and he went back\ncarrying a load of things to plant.  Only think of that!  Once he\nbegins planting, and watching things grow, the home feeling is bound to\ncome.  I tell you, Paul, the wedge is in!  Oh I'm so happy!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nThe Crest of Eastbrooke\n\n  \"Sow;--and look onward, upward,\n    Where the starry light appears,--\n  Where, in spite of coward's doubting,\n    Or your own heart's trembling fears,\n  You shall reap in joy the harvest\n    You have sown to-day in tears.\"\n\n\n\"Any objections to my beginning to break ground on the west eighty\nto-day?\" asked Laddie of father at breakfast Monday morning.\n\n\"I had thought we would commence on the east forty, when planning the\nwork.\"\n\n\"So had I,\" said Laddie.  \"But since I thought that, a very particular\nreason has developed for my beginning to plow the west eighty at once,\nand there is a charming little ditty I feel strongly impelled to\nwhistle every step of the way.\"\n\nFather looked at him sharply, and so, I think, did all of us.  And\nbecause we loved him deeply, we saw that his face was a trifle pale for\nhim; his clear eyes troubled, in spite of his laughing way.  He knew we\nwere studying him too, but he wouldn't have said anything that would\nmake us look and question if he had minded our doing it.  That was\nexactly like Laddie.  He meant it when he said he hated a secret.  He\nsaid there was no place on earth for a man to look for sympathy and\nlove if he couldn't find it in his own family; and he never had been so\nhappy since I had been big enough to notice his moods as he had been\nsince all of us knew about the Princess.  He didn't wait for father to\nask why he'd changed his mind about the place to begin.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, \"a very charming friend of mine expressed herself\nstrongly last night about the degrading influence of farming,\nespecially that branch of agriculture which evolves itself in a furrow;\nhence it is my none too happy work to plow the west eighty where she\ncan't look our way without seeing me; and I have got to whistle my\nfavourite 'toon' where she must stop her ears if she doesn't hear; and\nthen it will be my painful task, I fear, to endeavour to convince her\nthat I am still clean, decent, and not degraded.\"\n\n\"Oh Laddie!\" cried mother.\n\n\"Abominable foolishness!\" roared father like he does roar once in about\ntwo years.\n\n\"Isn't it now?\" asked Laddie sweetly.  \"I don't know what has got into\nher head.  She has seen me plowing fifty times since their land has\njoined ours, and she never objected before.\"\n\n\"I can tell you blessed well!\" said mother.  \"She didn't care two hoots\nhow much my son plowed, but it makes a difference when it comes to her\nlover.\"\n\n\"Maw, you speak amazing reckless,\" said Laddie, \"if I thought there was\nanything in THAT feature of the case, I'd attempt a Highland fling on\nthe ridgepole of our barn.\"\n\n\"Be serious!\" said father sternly.  \"This is no laughing matter.\"\n\n\"That's precisely why I am laughing,\" said Laddie.  \"Would it help me\nany to sit down and weep?  I trow not!  I have thought most of the\nsilent watches--by the way they are far from silent in May--and as I\nread my title clear, it's my job to plow the west eighty immejit.\"\n\nFather tried to look stern, but he just had to laugh.\n\n\"All right then, plow it!\" he said.\n\n\"What did she say?\" asked mother.\n\n\"Phew!\" Laddie threw up both hands.  \"She must have been bottled some\ntime on the subject.  The ferment was a spill of considerable\nmagnitude.  The flood rather overwhelmed me, because it was so\nunexpected.  I had been taking for granted that she accepted my\ncircumstances and surroundings as she did me.  But no, kind friends,\nfar otherwise!  She said last night, in the clearest English I ever\nheard spoken impromptu, that I was a man suitable for her friend, but I\nwould have to change my occupation before I could be received on more\nthan a friendly footing.\"\n\n\"'On more than a friendly footing'?\" repeated mother.\n\n\"You have her exact words,\" said Laddie.  \"Kindly pass the ham.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"Nothing!  I am going to plow the answer.  Please don't object to my\nbeginning this morning.\"\n\n\"You try yourself all winter to get as far as you have, and then upset\nthe bowl like this?\" cried mother.\n\n\"Softly, mummy, softly!\" said Laddie.  \"What am I to do?  I've\ndefinitely decided on my work.  I see land and life, as you and father\ntaught me, in range and in perspective far more than you've got from\nit.  You had a first hand wrestle.  The land I covet has been greatly\nimproved already.  I can do what I choose with it, making no more\nstrenuous effort than plowing; and I am proud to say that I LOVE to\nplow.  I like my feet in the soil.  I want my head in the spring air.\nI can become almost tipsy on the odours that fill my nostrils.  Music\nevolved by the Almighty is plenty good enough for me.  I'm proud of a\nspanking big team, under the control of a touch or a word.  I enjoy\nfarming, and I am going to be a farmer.  Plowing is one of the most\npleasing parts of the job.  Sowing the seed beats it a little, from an\nartistic standpoint, either is preferable to haying, threshing, or corn\ncutting: all are parts of my work, so I'm going to begin.  Mother, I\nhope you don't mind if I take your grays.  I'll be very careful; but\nthe picture I present to my girl to-day is going to go hard with her at\nbest, so I'd like to make it level best.\"\n\nHe arose, went around and knelt beside mother.  He took her, chair and\nall, in his arms:\n\n  \"Best of mothers! on my breast\n  Lean thy head, and sink to rest.\"\n\n\nShe quoted.  Mother laughed.\n\n\"Mammy,\" he asked bending toward her, \"am I clean?\"\n\n\"You goose!\" she said, putting her arms around him and holding him\ntight.\n\n\"Gander love,\" said Laddie, turning up his face for a kiss.  \"Honest\nmother, you have been through nigh unto forty years of it, tell me, can\na man be a farmer and keep neat enough not to be repulsive to a refined\nwoman?\"\n\n\"Your father is the answer,\" said mother.  \"All of you know how\nperfectly repulsive he is and always has been to me.\"\n\n\"'Repulsive,\"' said father.  \"That's an ugly word!\"\n\n\"There are a whole lot of unpleasant things that peep around corners\noccasionally,\" said Laddie.  \"But whoever of you dear people it was\nthat showed Mr. Pryor the Crest of Eastbrooke, brought out this\nparticular dragon for me to slay.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut!  Now what does that mean?\" said father.  \"Have we had a\nlittle exhibition of that especial brand of pride that goes before a\nfall?\"\n\n\"We have! and I take the tumble,\" said Laddie.  \"Watch me start!  'Jack\nfell down and broke his crown.'  Question--will 'Jill come tumbling\nafter?'\"\n\nMy heart stopped and I was shaking in my bare feet, because I wore no\nshoes to shake in.  Oh my soul!  No matter how Laddie jested I knew he\nwas almost killed; the harder he made fun, the worse he was hurt.  I\nopened my mouth to say I did it, I had to, but Leon began to talk.\n\n\"Well, I think she's smart!\" he cried.  \"If she was going to give you\nthe mitten, why didn't she do it long ago?\"\n\n\"She had to find out first whether there were a possibility of her\nwanting to keep it,\" said Laddie.\n\n\"You're sure you are all signed, sealed, and delivered on this plowing\nbusiness, are you?\" asked Leon.\n\n\"Dead sure!\" said Laddie.\n\n\"All right, if you like it!\" said Leon.  \"None for me after college!\nBut say, you can be a farmer and not plow, you know.  You go trim the\ntrees, and work at cleaner, more gentlemanly jobs.  I'll plow that\nfield.  I'd just as soon as not.  I plowed last year and you said I did\nwell, didn't you, father?\"\n\n\"Yes, on the potato patch,\" said father.  \"A cornfield is a different\nthing.  I fear you are too light.\"\n\n\"Oh but that was a year ago!\" cried Leon.\n\nHe pushed back his chair and went to father.\n\n\"Just feel my biceps now!  Most like steel!\" he boasted.  \"A fellow can\ngrow a lot in a year, and all the riding I've been doing, and all the\nexercise I've had.  Cert' I can plow that meadow.\"\n\n\"You're all right, shaver,\" said Laddie.  \"I'll not forget your offer;\nbut in this case it wouldn't help.  Either the Princess takes her\nmedicine or I take mine.  I'm going to live on land: I'm going to plow\nin plain sight of the Pryor house this week, if I have to hire to Jacob\nHood to get the chance.  May I plow, and may I take the grays, father?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said father roundly.\n\n\"Then here goes!\" said Laddie.  \"You needn't fret, mother.  I'll not\noverheat them.  I must give a concert simultaneous with this plowing\nperformance, and I'm particular about the music, so I can't go too\nfast.  Also, I'll wrap the harness.\"\n\n\"Goodness knows I'm not thinking about the horses,\" said mother.\n\n\"No, but if they turned up next Sunday, wind-broken, and with nice\nlarge patches of hair rubbed from their sides, you would be!  If you\nwere me, would you whistle, or vocalize to start on?\"\n\nMother burst right out crying and laid her face all tear-wet against\nhim.  Laddie kissed her, and wiped away the tears, teased her, and soon\nas he could he bolted from the east door; but I was closest, so I saw\nplainly that his eyes were wet too.  My soul and body!  AND I HAD DONE\nIT!  I might as well get it over.\n\n\"I showed Mr. Pryor the trinket,\" I said.\n\n\"How did you come to do that?\" asked father sternly.\n\n\"When he was talking with mother.  He told her Laddie would be 'wasted'\nfarming----\"\n\n\"Wasted?\"\n\n\"That's what he said.  Mother told him you had always farmed and you\nwere a 'power in this community.'  She told him about what you did,\nbecause you wanted to, and what you COULD do if you chose, about\nholding office, you know, and that seemed to make him think heaps more\nof you, so I thought it would be a good thing for him to know about the\nCrusaders too, and I ran and got the crest.  I THOUGHT it would\nhelp----\"\n\n\"And so it will,\" said mother.  \"They constantly make the best showing\nthey can, we might as well, too.  The trouble is they got more than\nthey expected.  They thought they could look down on us, and patronize\nus, if they came near at all; when they found we were quite as well\neducated as they, had as much land, could hold prominent offices if we\nchose, and had the right to that bauble, they veered to the other\nextreme.  Now they seem to demand that we quit work----\"\n\n\"Move to the city, 'sit on a cushion and sew a fine seam,'\" suggested\nfather.\n\n\"Exactly!\" said mother.  \"They'll have to find out we are running our\nown business; but I'm sorry it fell to Laddie to show them.  You could\nhave done it better.  It will come out all right.  The Princess is not\ngoing to lose a man like Laddie on account of how he makes his money.\"\n\n\"Don't be too confident,\" said father.  \"With people of their stripe,\nhow much money a man can earn, and at what occupation, constitute the\nwhole of life.\"\n\nShe wasn't too confident.  Yesterday she had been so happy she almost\nflew.  To-day she kept things going, and sang a lot, but nearly every\ntime you looked at her you could see her lips draw tight, a frown cross\nher forehead, and her head shake.  Pretty soon we heard a racket on the\nroad, so we went out.  There was Laddie with the matched team of\ncarriage horses and a plow.  Now, in dreadfully busy times, father let\nNed and Jo work a little, but not very much.  They were not plow\nhorses; they were roadsters.  They liked to prance, and bow their necks\nand dance to the carriage.  It shamed them to be hitched to a plow.\nThey drooped their heads and slunk along like dogs caught sucking eggs.\nBut they were a sight on the landscape.  They were lean and slender and\nyet round too, matched dapple gray on flank and side, with long\nsnow-white manes and tails.  No wonder mother didn't want them to work.\nLaddie had reached through the garden fence and hooked a bunch of red\ntulips and yellow daffodils.  The red was at Jo's ear, and the yellow\nat Ned's, and they did look fine.  So did he!  Big, strong, clean, a\nred flower in his floppy straw hat band; and after he drove through the\ngate, he began a shrill, fifelike whistle you could have heard a half\nmile:\n\n  \"See the merry farmer boy, tramp the meadows through,\n  Swing his hoe in careless joy, while dashing off the dew.\n  Bobolink in maple high, trills a note of glee,\n  Farmer boy in gay reply now whistles cheerily.\"\n\n\nThe chorus was all whistle, and it was written for folks who could.  It\nwent up until it almost split the echoes, and Laddie could easily sail\na measure above the notes.  He did it too.  As for me, I kept from\nsight.  For a week Laddie whistled and plowed.  He wore that tune\nthreadbare, and got an almost continuous pucker on his lips.  Leon said\nif he didn't stop whistling, and sing more, the girls would think he\nwas doing a prunes and prisms stunt.  So after that he sang the words,\nand whistled the chorus.  But he made no excuse to go, and he didn't\ngo, to Pryors'.  When Sunday came, he went to Westchester to see\nElizabeth, and stayed until Monday morning.  Not once that week did the\nPrincess ride past our house, or her father either.  By noon Monday\nLaddie was back in the field, and I had all I could bear.  He was\nneither whistling nor singing so much now, because he was away at the\nsouth end, where he couldn't be seen or heard at Pryors'.  He almost\nscoured the skin from him, and he wore his gloves more carefully than\nusual.  If he soiled his clothing in the least, and it looked as if he\nwould make more than his share of work, he washed the extra pieces at\nnight.\n\nTuesday morning I hurried with all my might, and then I ran to the\nfield where he was.  I climbed on the fence, sat there until he came\nup, and then I gave him some cookies.  He stopped the horses, climbed\nbeside me and ate them.  Then he put his arms around me and hugged me\ntight.\n\n\"Laddie, do you know I did it?\" I wailed.\n\n\"Did you now?\" said Laddie.  \"No, I didn't know for sure, but I had\nsuspicions.  You always have had such a fondness for that particular\npiece of tinware.\"\n\n\"But Laddie, it means so much!\"\n\n\"Doesn't it?\" said Laddie.  \"A few days ago no one could have convinced\nme that it meant anything at all to me, or ever could.  Just look at me\nnow!\"\n\n\"Don't joke, Laddie!  Something must be done.\"\n\n\"Well, ain't I doing it?\" asked Laddie.  \"Look at all these acres and\nacres of Jim-dandy plowing!\"\n\n\"Don't!\" I begged.  \"Why don't you go over there?\"\n\n\"No use, Chicken,\" said Laddie.  \"You see her exact stipulation was\nthat I must CHANGE MY OCCUPATION before I came again.\"\n\n\"What does she want you to do?\"\n\n\"Law, I think.  Unfortunately, I showed her a letter from Jerry asking\nme to enter his office this fall.\"\n\n\"Hadn't you better do it, Laddie?\"\n\n\"How would you like to be shut in little, stuffy rooms, and set to\ndroning over books and papers every hour of the day, all your life, and\nto spend the best of your brain and bodily strength straightening out\nother men's quarrels?\"\n\n\"Oh Laddie, you just couldn't!\" I cried.\n\n\"Precisely!\" said Laddie.  \"I just couldn't, and I just won't!\"\n\n\"What can you do?\"\n\n\"I might compromise on stock,\" he said.  \"I could follow the same\noccupation as her father, and with better success.  Neither he nor his\nmen get the best results from horses.  They don't understand them,\nespecially the breeds they are attempting to handle.  Most Arab\nhorsemen are tent dwellers.  They travel from one oasis to another with\ntheir stock.  At night their herds are gathered around them as\nchildren.  As children they love them, pet them, feed them.  Each is\nnamed for a divinity, a planet or a famous ruler, and the understanding\nbetween master and beast is perfect.  Honestly, Little Sister, I think\nyou have got to believe in the God of Israel, in order to say the right\nword to an Arabian horse; and I know you must believe in the God of\nlove.  A beast of that breed, jerked, kicked, and scolded is a fine\nhorse ruined.  If I owned half the stock Mr. Pryor has over there, I\ncould put it in such shape for market that I could get twice from it\nwhat his men will.\"\n\n\"Are Thomas and James rough with the horses?\"\n\n\"'Like master, like man,'\" quoted Laddie.  \"They are!  They are foolish\nwith the Kentucky strain, and fools with the Arab; and yet, that\ncombination beats the world.  But I must get on with the P.C. job.\"\n\nHe slid from the fence, took a drink from his water jug, and pulled a\nhandful of grass for each horse.  As he stood feeding them, I almost\nfell from the top rail.\n\n\"Laddie!\" I whispered.  \"Look!  Mr. Pryor is halfway across the field\non Ranger.\"\n\n\"So?\" said Laddie.  \"Now I wonder----\"\n\n\"Shall I go?\"\n\n\"No indeed!\" said Laddie.  \"Stay right where you are.  It can't be\nanything of much importance.\"\n\nAt first it didn't seem to be.  They talked about the weather, the\nsoil, the team.  Laddie scooped a handful of black earth, and holding\nit out, told Mr. Pryor all about how good it was, and why, and he\nseemed interested.  Then they talked about everything; until if he had\nbeen Jacob Hood, he would have gone away.  But just at the time when I\nexpected him to start, he looked at Laddie straight and hard.\n\n\"I missed you Sabbath evening,\" he said.\n\nThen I looked at him.  He had changed, some way.  He seemed more human,\nmore like our folks, less cold and stern.\n\n\"I sincerely hope it was unanimous,\" said Laddie.\n\nMr. Pryor had to laugh.\n\n\"It was a majority, at any rate.\"\n\nLaddie stared dazed.  You see that was kind of a joke.  An easy one,\nbecause I caught it; but we were not accustomed to expecting a jest\nfrom Mr. Pryor.  Not one of us dreamed there was a joke between his hat\ncrown and his boot soles.  Then Laddie laughed; but he sobered quickly.\n\n\"I'm mighty sorry if Mrs. Pryor missed me,\" he said.  \"I thought of\nher.  I have grown to be her devoted slave, and I hoped she liked me.\"\n\n\"You put it mildly,\" said Mr. Pryor.  \"Since you didn't come when she\nexpected you, we've had the worst time with her that we have had since\nwe reached this da--ah--er--um--this country.\"\n\n\"Could you make any suggestion?\" asked Laddie.\n\n\"I could!  I would suggest that you act like the sensible fellow I know\nyou to be, and come as usual, at your accustomed times.\"\n\n\"But I'm forbidden, man!\" cried Laddie.\n\nUgh!  Such awful things as Mr. Pryor said.\n\n\"Forbidden!\" he cried.  \"Is a man's roof his own, or is it not?  While\nI live, I propose to be the head of my family.  I invite you!  I ask\nyou!  Mrs. Pryor and I want you!  What more is necessary?\"\n\n\"TWO things,\" said Laddie, just as serenely.  \"That Miss Pryor wants\nme, and that I want to come.\"\n\n\"D'ye mean to tell me that you DON'T want to come, eh?  After the fight\nyou put up to force your way in!\"\n\nLaddie studied the sky, a whimsy smile on his lips.\n\n\"Now wasn't that a good fight?\" he inquired.  \"I'm mighty proud of it!\nBut not now, or ever, do I wish to enter your house again, if Miss\nPryor doesn't want, and welcome me.\"\n\nThen he went over, took Mr. Pryor's horse by the head, and began\nworking with its bridle.  It didn't set right some way, and Mr. Pryor\nhad jerked, spurred, and mauled, until there was a big space tramped to\nmortar.  Laddie slid his fingers beneath the leather, eased it a\nlittle, and ran his hands over the fretful creature's head.  It just\nstopped, stood still, pushed its nose under his arm, and pressed\nagainst his side.  Mr. Pryor arose in one stirrup, swung around and\nalighted.  He looped an arm through the bridle rein, and with both\nhands gripped his whipstock.\n\n\"How the devil do you do it?\" he asked, as if he were provoked.\n\n\"First, the bridle was uncomfortable; next, you surely know, Mr. Pryor,\nthat a man can transfer his mental state to his mount.\"\n\nLaddie pointed to the churned up earth.\n\n\"THAT represents your mental state; THIS\"--he slid his hand down the\nneck of the horse--\"portrays mine.\"\n\nMr. Pryor's face reddened, but Laddie was laughing so heartily he\njoined in sort of sickly-like.\n\n\"Oh I doubt if you are so damnably calm!\" he cried.\n\n\"I'm CALM enough, so far as that goes,\" said Laddie.  \"I'm not denying\nthat I've got about all the heartache I can conveniently carry.\"\n\n\"Do you mind telling me how far this affair has gone?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't a right-minded man give the woman in the case the first\nchance to answer that question?  I greatly prefer that you ask Miss\nPryor.\"\n\nIf ever I felt sorry for any one, I did then for Mr. Pryor.  He stood\nthere gripping the whip with both hands and he looked exactly as if the\nMay wind might break him into a thousand tiny pieces, and every one of\nthem would be glass.\n\n\"Um--er----\" he said at last.  \"You're right, of course, but\nunfortunately, Pamela and her mother did not agree with my motives, or\nmy course in coming to this country; and while there is no outward\ndemonstration er--um--other than Mrs. Pryor's seclusion; yet,\ner--um!--I am forced to the belief that I'm NOT in their confidence.\"\n\n\"I see!\" said Laddie.  \"And of course you love your daughter as any man\nwould love so beautiful a child, and when she is all he has----\"  I\nthought the break was coming right there, but Mr. Pryor clenched his\nwhip and put it off; still, any one watching with half an eye could see\nthat it was only put off, and not for long at that,--\"It has been my\nidea, Mr. Pryor, that the proper course for me was to see if I could\nearn any standing with your daughter.  If I could, and she gave me\npermission, then I intended coming to you the instant I knew how she\nfelt.  But in such a case as this, I don't think I shall find the\nslightest hesitation in telling you anything you want to know, that I\nam able.\"\n\n\"You don't know how you stand with her?\"\n\nLaddie took off his hat and ran his fingers through his hair.  His feet\nwere planted widely apart, and his face was sober enough for any\nfuneral now.  At last he spoke.\n\n\"I've been trying to figure that out,\" he said slowly.  \"I believe the\nsituation is as open to you as it is to me.  She was a desperately\nlonely, homesick girl, when she caught my eye and heart; and I placed\nmyself on her horizon.  In her case the women were slow in offering\nfriendship, because, on account of Mrs. Pryor's seclusion, none was\nfelt to be wanted; then Miss Pryor was different in dress and manner.\nI found a way to let her see that I wanted to be friends, and she\naccepted my friendship, and at the same time allowed it go only so far.\nOn a few rare occasions, I've met her alone, and we've talked out\nvarious phases of life together; but most of our intercourse has taken\nplace in your home, and in your presence.  You probably have seen her\nmeet and entertain her friends frequently.  I should think you would be\nmore nearly able to gauge my standing with her than I am.\"\n\n\"You haven't told her that you love her?\"\n\n\"Haven't I though?\" cried Laddie.  \"Man alive!  What do you think I'm\nmade of?  Putty?  Told her?  I've told her a thousand times.  I've said\nit, and sung it and whistled it, and looked it, and lived it.  I've\nwritten it, and ridden it, and this week I've plowed it!  Your daughter\nknows as she knows nothing else, in all this world, that she has only\nto give me one glance, one word, one gesture of invitation, to find me\nbefore her six feet of the worst demoralized beefsteak a woman ever\nundertook to handle.  Told her?  Ye Gods!  I should say I've told her!\"\n\nIf any of Pryors had been outdoors they certainly could have heard Mr.\nPryor.  How he laughed!  He shook until he tottered.  Laddie took his\narm and led him to the fence.  He lifted a broad top rail, pushed it\nbetween two others across a corner and made a nice comfortable seat for\nhim.  After a while Mr. Pryor wiped his eyes.  Laddie stood watching\nhim with a slow grin on his face.\n\n\"And she hasn't given the signal you are waiting for?\" he asked at last.\n\nLaddie slowly shook his head.\n\n\"Nary the ghost of a signal!\" he said.  \"Now we come to Sunday before\nlast.  I only intimated, vaguely, that a hint of where I stood would be\na comfort--and played Jonah.  The whale swallowed me at a gulp, and for\nall my inches, never batted an eye.  You see, a few days before I\nshowed her a letter from my brother Jerry, because I thought it might\ninterest her.  There was something in it to which I had paid little or\nno attention, about my going to the city and beginning work in his law\noffice; to cap that, evidently you had mentioned before her our prize\npiece of family tinware.  There was a culmination like a thunder clap\nin a January sky.  She said everything that was on her mind about a man\nof my size and ability doing the work I am, and then she said I must\nchange my occupation before I came again.\"\n\n\"And for answer you've split the echoes with some shrill, abominable\nair, and plowed, before her very eyes, for a week!\"\n\nThen Laddie laughed.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he said; \"that's a good one on me!  It never occurred to\nme that she would not be familiar with that air, and understand its\napplication.  Do you mean to crush me further by telling me that all my\nperfectly lovely vocalizing and whistling was lost?\"\n\n\"It was a dem irritating, challenging sort of thing,\" said Mr. Pryor.\n\"I listened to it by the hour, myself, trying to make out exactly what\nit did mean.  It seemed to combine defiance with pleading, and through\nand over all ran a note of glee that was really quite charming.\"\n\n\"You have quoted a part of it, literally,\" said Laddie.  \"'A note of\nglee'--the cry of a glad heart, at peace with all the world, busy with\ncongenial work.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't have thought you'd have been so particularly joyful.\"\n\n\"Oh, the joy was in the music,\" said Laddie.  \"That was a whistle to\nkeep up my courage.  The joy was in the song, not in me!  Last week was\nblack enough for me to satisfy the most exacting pessimist.\"\n\n\"I wish you might have seen the figure you cut!  That fine team, flower\nbedecked, and the continuous concert!\"\n\n\"But I did!\" cried Laddie.  \"We have mirrors.  That song can't be\nbeaten.  I know this team is all right, and I'm not dwarfed or\ndisfigured.  That was the pageant of summer passing in review.  It\nrepresented the tilling of the soil; the sowing of seed, garnering to\ncome later.  You buy corn and wheat, don't you?  They are vastly\nnecessary.  Much more so than the settling of quarrels that never\nshould have taken place.  Do you think your daughter found the\nspectacle at all moving?\"\n\n\"Damn you, sir, what I should do, is to lay this whip across your\nshoulders!\" cried Mr. Pryor.\n\nBut if you will believe it, he was laughing again.\n\n\"I prefer that you don't,\" said Laddie, \"or on Ranger either.  See how\nhe likes being gentled.\"\n\nThen he straightened and drew a deep breath.\n\n\"Mr. Pryor,\" he said, \"as man to man, I have got this to say to\nyou--and you may use your own discretion about repeating it to your\ndaughter:  I can offer her six feet of as sound manhood as you can find\non God's footstool.  I never in my whole life have had enough impure\nblood in my body to make even one tiny eruption on my skin.  I never\nhave been ill a day in my life.  I never have touched a woman save as I\nlifted and cared for my mother, and hers, or my sisters.  As to my\nfamily and education she can judge for herself.  I offer her the first\nand only love of my heart.  She objects to farming, because she says it\nis dirty, offensive work.  There are parts of it that are dirty.  Thank\nGod, it only soils the body, and that can be washed.  To delve and to\ndive into, and to study and to brood over the bigger half of the law\nbusiness of any city is to steep your brain in, and smirch your soul\nwith, such dirt as I would die before I'd make an occupation of\ntouching.  Will you kindly tell her that word for word, and that I\nasked you to?\"\n\nMr. Pryor was standing before I saw him rise.  He said those awful\nwords again, but between them he cried:  \"You're right!  It's the\ntruth! It's the eternal truth!\"\n\n\"It IS the truth,\" said Laddie.  \"I've only to visit the offices, and\nexamine the business of those of my family living by law, to KNOW that\nit's the truth.  Of course there's another side!  There are times when\nthere are great opportunities to do good; I recognize that.  To some\nthese may seem to overbalance that to which I object.  If they do, all\nright.  I am merely deciding for myself.  Once and for all, for me it\nis land.  It is born in me to love it, to handle it easily, to get the\nbest results from stock.  I am going to take the Merriweather place\nadjoining ours on the west, and yours on the south.  I intend to lease\nit for ten years, with purchase privilege at the end, so that if I make\nof it what I plan, my work will not be lost to me.  I had thought to\nfix up the place and begin farming.  If Miss Pryor has any use whatever\nfor me, and prefers stock, that is all right with me.  I'll go into the\nsame business she finds suitable for you.  I can start in a small way\nand develop.  I can afford a maid for her from the beginning, but I\ncouldn't clothe her as she has been accustomed to being dressed, for\nsome time.  I would do my best, however.  I know what store my mother\nsets by being well gowned.  And as a husband, I can offer your daughter\nas loving consideration as woman ever received at the hands of man.\nProvided by some miracle I could win her consent, would you even\nconsider me, and such an arrangement?\"\n\n\"Frankly sir,\" said Mr. Pryor, \"I have reached the place where I would\nbe----\" whenever you come to a long black line like that, it means that\nhe just roared a lot of words father never said, and never will--\"glad\nto!  To tell the truth, the thing you choose to jestingly refer to as\n'tinware'--I hope later to convince of the indelicacy of such\nallusion--would place you in England on a social level above any we\never occupied, or could hope to.  Your education equals ours.  You are\na physical specimen to be reckoned with, and I believe what you say of\nyourself.  There's something so clean and manly about you, it amounts\nto confirmation.  A woman should set her own valuation on that; and the\nheight of it should correspond with her knowledge of the world.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" said Laddie.  \"You are more than kind! more than generous!\"\n\n\"As to the arrangements you could make for Pamela,\" said Mr. Pryor,\n\"she's all we have.  Everything goes to her, ultimately.  She has her\nstipulated allowance now; whether in my house or yours, it would go\nwith her.  Surely you wouldn't be so callous as to object to our giving\nher anything that would please us!\"\n\n\"Why should I?\" asked Laddie.  \"That's only natural on your part.  Your\nchild is your child; no matter where or what it is, you expect to\nexercise a certain amount of loving care over it.  My father and mother\nconstantly send things to their children absent from home, and they\ntake much pleasure in doing it.  That is between you and your daughter,\nof course.  I shouldn't think of interfering.  But in the meantime,\nunless Miss Pryor has been converted to the beauties of plowing through\nmy continuous performance of over a week, I stand now exactly where I\ndid before, so far as she is concerned.  If you and Mrs. Pryor have no\nobjection to me, if you feel that you could think of me, or find for me\nany least part of a son's place in your hearts, I believe I should know\nhow to appreciate it, and how to go to work to make myself worthy of\nit.\"\n\nMr. Pryor sat down so suddenly, the rail almost broke.  I thought the\ntruth was, that he had heart trouble, himself.  He stopped up, choked\non things, flopped around, and turned so white.  I suppose he thought\nit was womanish, and a sign of weakness, and so he didn't tell, but I\nbet anything that he had it--bad!\n\n\"I'll try to make the little fool see!\" he said.\n\n\"Gently, gently!  You won't help me any in that mood,\" said Laddie.\n\"The chances are that Miss Pryor repeated what she heard from you long\nago, and what she knows you think and feel, unless you've changed\nrecently.\"\n\n\"That's the amount of it!\" cried Mr. Pryor.  \"All my life I've had a\nlot of beastly notions in my head about rank, and class, and here they\ndon't amount to a damn!  There's no place for them.  Things are\ndifferent.  Your mother, a grand, good woman, opened my eyes to many\nthings recently, and I get her viewpoint--clearly, and I agree with\nher, and with you, sir!--I agree with you!\"\n\n\"I am more than glad,\" said Laddie.  \"You certainly make a friend at\ncourt.  Thank you very much!\"\n\n\"And you will come----?\"\n\n\"The instant Miss Pryor gives me the slightest sign that I am wanted,\nand will be welcomed by her, I'll come like a Dakota blizzard!  Flos\ncan hump herself on time for once.\"\n\n\"But you won't come until she does?\"\n\n\"Man alive!  I can't!\" cried Laddie.  \"Your daughter said positively\nexactly what she meant.  It was unexpected and it hit me so hard I\ndidn't try to argue.  I simply took her at her word, her very explicit\nword.\"\n\n\"Fool!\" cried Mr. Pryor.  \"The last thing on earth any woman ever wants\nor expects is for a man to take her at her word.\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Laddie.\n\n\"She had what she said in her mind of course, but what she wanted was\nto be argued out of it!  She wanted to be convinced!\"\n\n\"I think not!  She was entirely too convincing herself,\" said Laddie.\n\"It's my guess that she has thought matters over, and that her mind is\nmade up; but I would take it as a mighty big favour if you would put\nthat little piece of special pleading squarely up to her.  Will you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Pryor, \"I will.  I'll keep cool and do my best, but I\nam so unfortunate in my temper.  I could manage slaves better than\nwomen.  This time I'll be calm, and reason things out with her, or I'll\nblow out my brains.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare!\" laughed Laddie.  \"You and I are going to get much\npleasure, comfort and profit from this world, now that we have come to\nan understanding.\"\n\nMr. Pryor arose and held out his hand.  Laddie grasped it tight, and\nthey stood there looking straight at each other, while a lark on the\nfence post close by cried, \"Spring o' ye-ar!\" at them, over and over,\nbut they never paid the least attention.\n\n\"You see,\" said Mr. Pryor, \"I've been thinking things over deeply,\ndeeply! ever since talking with your mother.  I've cut myself off from\ngoing back to England, by sacrificing much of my property in hasty\ndeparture, if by any possibility I should ever want to return, and\nthere is none, not the slightest!  There's no danger of any one\ncrossing the sea, and penetrating to this particular spot so far\ninland; we won't be molested!  And lately--lately, despite the rawness,\nand the newness, there is something about the land that takes hold,\nafter all.  I should dislike leaving now!  I found in watching some\nroots your mother gave me, that I wanted them to grow, that I very much\nhoped they would develop, and beautify our place with flowers, as yours\nis.  I find myself watching them, watching them daily, and oftener, and\nthere seems to be a sort of home feeling creeping around my heart.  I\nwish Pamela would listen to reason!  I wish she would marry you soon!\nI wish there would be little children.  Nothing else on earth would\ncome so close to comforting my wife, and me also.  Nothing!  Go ahead,\nlad, plow away!  I'll put your special pleading up to the girl.\"\n\nHe clasped Laddie's hand, mounted and rode back to the gate he had\nentered when he came.  Laddie sat on the rail, so I climbed down beside\nhim.  He put his arm around me.\n\n\"Do I feel any better?\" he asked dubiously.\n\n\"Of course you do!\" I said stoutly.  \"You feel whole heaps, and stacks,\nand piles better.  You haven't got him to fight any more, or Mrs.\nPryor.  It's now only to convince the Princess about how it's all right\nto plow.\"\n\n\"Small matter, that!\" said Laddie.  \"And easy!  Just as simple and\neasy!\"\n\n\"Have you asked the Fairies to help you?\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Laddie.  \"Also the winds, the flowers, the birds\nand the bees!  I have asked everything on earth to help me except you,\nLittle Sister.  I wonder if I have been making a mistake there?\"\n\n\"Are you mad at me, Laddie?\"\n\n\"'Cause for why?\"\n\n\"About the old crest thing!\"\n\n\"Forget it!\" laughed Laddie.  \"I have.  And anyway, in the long run, I\nmust be honest enough to admit that it may have helped.  It seems to\nhave had its influence with Mr. Pryor, no doubt it worked the same on\nMrs. Pryor, and it may be that it was because she had so much more to\nbank on than she ever expected, that the Princess felt emboldened to\nmake her demand.  It may be, you can't tell!  Anyway, it's very evident\nthat it did no real harm.  And forget my jesting, Chicken.  A man can't\nalways cry because there are tears in his heart.  I think quite as much\nof that crest as you do.  In the sum of human events, it is a big\nthing.  No one admires a Crusader more than I.  No one likes a good\nfight better.  No Crusader ever put up a stiffer battle than I have in\nthe past week while working in these fields.  Every inch of them is\nbattlefield, every furrow a separate conflict.  Gaze upon the scene of\nmy Waterloo!  When June covers it with green, it will wave over the\nresting place of my slain heart!\"\n\n\"Oh Laddie!\" I sobbed.  \"There you go again!  How can you?\"\n\n\"Whoo-pee!\" cried Laddie.  \"That's the question!  How can I?  Got to,\nLittle Sister!  There's no other way.\"\n\n\"No,\" I was forced to admit, \"there isn't.  What are we going to do\nnow?\"\n\n\"Life-saver, we'll now go to dinner,\" said Laddie.  \"Nothing except the\npartnership implied in 'we' sustains me now.  YOU'LL FIND A WAY TO HELP\nME OUT, WON'T YOU, LITTLE SISTER?\"\n\n\"OF COURSE I WILL!\" I promised, without ever stopping a minute to think\nwhat kind of a job that was going to be.\n\nDid you ever wish with all your might that something would happen, and\nwait for it, expect it, and long for it, and nothing did, until it grew\nso bad, it seemed as if you had to go on another minute you couldn't\nbear it?  Now I thought when Mr. Pryor talked to her, maybe she'd send\nfor Laddie that very same night; but send nothing!  She didn't even\nride on our road any more.  Of course her father had made a botch of\nit!  Bet I could have told her Laddie's message straighter than he did.\nI could think it over, and see exactly how he'd do.  He'd talk nicely\nabout one minute, and the first word she said, that he didn't like,\nhe'd be ranting, and using unsuitable words.  Just as like as not he\ntold her that he'd lay his whip across her shoulders, like he had\nLaddie.  Any one could see that as long as she was his daughter, she\nmight be slightly handy with whips herself; at least she wouldn't be\nlikely to stand still and tell him to go ahead and beat her.\n\nSunday Laddie went to Lucy's.  He said he was having a family reunion\non the installment plan.  Of course we laughed, but none of us missed\nthe long look he sent toward Pryors' as he mounted to start in the\nopposite direction.\n\nEverything went on.  I didn't see how it could, but it did.  It even\ngot worse, for another letter came from Shelley that made matters\nconcerning her no brighter, and while none of us talked about Laddie,\nall of us knew mighty well how we felt; and what was much worse, how he\nfelt.  Father and mother had quit worrying about God; especially\nfather.  He seemed to think that God and Laddie could be trusted to\ntake care of the Princess, and I don't know exactly what mother\nthought.  No doubt she saw she couldn't help herself, and so she\ndecided it was useless to struggle.\n\nThe plowing on the west side was almost finished, and some of the seed\nwas in.  Laddie went straight ahead flower-trimmed and whistling until\nhis face must have ached as badly as his heart.  In spite of how hard\nhe tried to laugh, and keep going, all of us could see that he fairly\nhad to stick up his head and stretch his neck like the blue goose, to\nmake the bites go down.  And you couldn't help seeing the roundness and\nthe colour go from his face, a little more every day.  My! but being in\nlove, when you couldn't have the one you loved, was the worst of all.\nI wore myself almost as thin as Laddie, hunting a Fairy to ask if she'd\nhelp me to make the Princess let Laddie go on and plow, when he was so\ncrazy about it.  I prayed beside my bed every night, until the Lord\nmust have grown so tired He quit listening to me, for I talked right up\nas impressively as I knew how, and it didn't do the least bit of good.\nI hadn't tried the one big prayer toward the east yet; but I was just\nabout to the place where I intended to do it soon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nLaddie, the Princess, and the Pie\n\n  \"O whistle, and I'll come to you, my lad.\"\n\n\nCandace was baking the very first batch of rhubarb pies for the season\nand the odour was so tempting I couldn't keep away from the kitchen\ndoor.  Now Candace was a splendid cook about chicken gizzards--the\nliver was always mother's--doughnuts and tarts, but I never really did\nbelieve she would cut into a fresh rhubarb pie, even for me.  As I\nreached for the generous big piece I thought of Laddie poor Laddie,\nplowing away at his Crusader fight, and not a hint of victory.  No one\nin the family liked rhubarb pie better than he did.  I knew there was\nno use to ask for a plate.\n\n\"Wait--oh wait!\" I cried.\n\nI ran to the woodshed, pulled a shining new shingle from a bale stacked\nthere, and held it for Candace.  Then I slipped around the house\nsoftly.  I didn't want to run any one's errands that morning.  I laid\nthe pie on the horseblock and climbed the catalpa carefully, so as not\nto frighten my robins.  They were part father's too, because robins\nwere his favourite birds; he said their song through and after rain was\nthe sweetest music on earth, and mostly he was right; so they were not\nall my robins, but they were most mine after him; and I owned the tree.\nI hunted the biggest leaf I could see, and wiped it clean on my apron,\nalthough it was early for much dust.  It covered the pie nicely,\nbecause it was the proper shape, and I held the stem with one hand to\nkeep it in place.\n\n\nIf I had made that morning myself I couldn't have done better.  It was\nsunny, spring air, but it was that cool, spicy kind that keeps you\nstopping every few minutes to see just how full you can suck your lungs\nwithout bursting.  It seemed to wash right through and through and make\nyou all over.  The longer you breathed it the clearer your head became,\nand the better you felt, until you would be possessed to try and see if\nyou really couldn't fly.  I tried that last summer, and knocked myself\ninto jelly.  You'd think once would have been enough, but there I was\ngoing down the road with Laddie's pie, and wanting with all my heart to\ntry again.\n\nSometimes I raced, but I was a little afraid the pie would shoot from\nthe shingle and it was like pulling eye teeth to go fast that morning.\nI loved the soft warm dust, that was working up on the road.  Spat!\nSpat!  I brought down my bare feet, already scratched and turning\nbrown, and laughed to myself at the velvety feel of it.  There were\nlittle puddles yet, where May and I had \"dipped and faded\" last fall,\nand it was fun to wade them.  The roadsides were covered with meadow\ngrass and clover that had slipped through the fence.  On slender green\nblades, in spot after spot, twinkled the delicate bloom of blue-eyed\ngrass.  Never in all this world was our Big Creek lovelier.  It went\nslipping, and whispering, and lipping, and lapping over the stones,\ntugging at the rushes and grasses as it washed their feet; everything\nbeside it was in masses of bloom, a blackbird was gleaming and preening\non every stone, as it plumed after its bath.  Oh there's no use to\ntry--it was just SPRING when it couldn't possibly be any better.\n\nBut even spring couldn't hold me very long that morning, for you see my\nheart was almost sick about Laddie; and if he couldn't have the girl he\nwanted, at least I could do my best to comfort him with the pie.  I was\ngoing along being very careful the more I thought about how he would\nlike it, so I was not watching the road so far ahead as I usually did.\nI always kept a lookout for Paddy Ryan, Gypsies, or Whitmore's bull.\nWhen I came to an unusually level place, and took a long glance ahead,\nmy heart turned right over and stopped still, and I looked long enough\nto be sure, and then right out loud some one said, \"I'll DO something!\"\nand as usual, I was the only one there.\n\nFor days I'd been in a ferment, like the vinegar barrel when the cider\nboils, or the yeast jar when it sets too close to the stove.  To have\nLaddie and the Princess separated was dreadful, and knowing him as I\ndid, I knew he never really would get over it.  I had tried to help\nonce, and what I had done started things going wrong; no wonder I was\nslow about deciding what to try next.  That I was going to do\nsomething, I made up my mind the instant Laddie said he was not mad at\nme; that I was his partner, and asked me to help; but exactly WHAT\nwould do any good, took careful thought.\n\nHere was my chance coming right at me.  She was far up the road, riding\nMaud like racing.  I began to breathe after a while, like you always\ndo, no matter how you are worked up, and with my brain whirling, I went\nslowly toward her.  How would I manage to stop her?  Or what could I\nsay that would help Laddie?  I was shaking, and that's the truth; but\nthrough and over it all, I was watching her too.  I only wish you might\nhave seen her that morning.  Of course the morning was part of it.  A\nmorning like that would make a fence post better looking.  Half a mile\naway you could see she was tipsy with spring as I was, or the song\nsparrows, or the crazy babbling old bobolinks on the stakes and riders.\nShe made such a bright splash against the pink fence row, with her dark\nhair, flushed cheeks, and red lips, she took my breath.  Father said\nshe was the loveliest girl in three counties, and Laddie stretched that\nto the whole world.  As she came closer, smash!  through me went the\nthought that she looked precisely as Shelley had at Christmas time; and\nShelley had been that way because she was in love with the Paget man.\nNow if the Princess was gleaming and flashing like that, for the same\nreason, there wasn't any one for her to love so far as I knew, except\nLaddie.\n\nThen smash! came another thought.  She HAD to love him!  She couldn't\nhelp herself.  She had all winter, all last summer, and no one but\nthemselves knew how long before that, and where was there any other man\nlike Laddie?  Of course she loved him!  Who so deserving of love?  Who\nelse had his dancing eyes of deep tender blue, cheeks so pink, teeth so\nwhite, such waving chestnut hair, and his height and breadth?  There\nwas no other man who could ride, swim, leap, and wrestle as he could.\nNone who could sing the notes, do the queer sums with letters having\nlittle figures at the corners in the college books, read Latin as fast\nas English, and even the Greek Bible.  Of course she loved him!  Every\none did!  Others might plod and meander, Laddie walked the tired, old\nroad that went out of sight over the hill, with as prideful a step as\nany king; his laugh was as merry as the song of the gladdest thrush,\nwhile his touch was so gentle that when mother was in dreadful pain I\nsometimes thought she would a little rather have him hold her than\nfather.\n\nNow, he was in this fearful trouble, the colour was going from his\nface, his laugh was a little strained, and the heartache almost more\nthan he could endure--and there she came!  I stepped squarely in the\nmiddle of the road so she would have to stop or ride over me, and when\nshe was close, I stood quite still.  I was watching with my eyes,\nheart, and brain, and I couldn't see that she was provoked, as she drew\nrein and cried:  \"Good morning, Little Queer Person!\"\n\nI had supposed she would say Little Sister, she had for ages, just like\nLaddie, but she must have thought it was queer for me to stop her that\nway, so she changed.  I was in for it.  I had her now, so I smiled the\nvery sweetest smile that I could think up in such a hurry, and said,\n\"Good morning,\" the very politest I ever did in all my life.  Then I\ndidn't know what to do next, but she helped me out.\n\n\"What have you there?\" she asked.\n\n\"It's a piece of the very first rhubarb pie for this spring, and I'm\ncarrying it to Laddie,\" I said, as I lifted the catalpa leaf and let\nher peep, just to show her how pie looked when it was right.  I bet she\nnever saw a nicer piece.\n\nThe Princess slid her hand down Maud's neck to quiet her prancing, and\nleaned in the saddle, her face full of interest.  I couldn't see a\ntrace of anything to discourage me; her being on our road again looked\nfavourable.  She seemed to think quite as much of that pie as I did.\nShe was the finest little thoroughbred.  She understood so well, I was\nsorry I couldn't give it to her.  It made her mouth water all right,\nfor she drew a deep breath that sort of quivered; but it was no use,\nshe didn't get that pie.\n\n\"I think it looks delicious,\" she said.  \"Are you carrying it for\nCandace?\"\n\n\"No!  She gave it to me.  It's my very own.\"\n\n\"And you're doing without it yourself to carry it to Laddie, I'll be\nbound!\" cried the Princess.\n\n\"I'd much rather,\" I said.\n\n\"Do you love Laddie so dearly?\" she asked.\n\nMy heart was full of him right then; I forgot all about when I had the\nfever, and as I never had been taught to lie, I told her what I thought\nwas the truth, and I guess it WAS:  \"Best of any one in all this world!\"\n\nThe Princess looked across the field, where she must have seen him\nfinishing the plowing, and thought that over, and I waited, sure in my\nmind, for some reason, that she would not go for a little while longer.\n\n\"I have been wanting to see you,\" she said at last.  \"In fact I think I\ncame this way hoping I'd meet you.  Do you know the words to a tune\nthat goes like this?\"\n\nThen she began to whistle \"The Merry Farmer Boy.\" I wish you might have\nheard the flourishes she put to it.\n\n\"Of course I do,\" I answered.  \"All of us were brought up on it.\"\n\n\"Well, I have some slight curiosity to learn what they are,\" she said.\n\"Would you kindly repeat them for me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.  \"This is the first verse:\n\n  \"'See the merry farmer boy tramp the meadows through,\n  Swing his hoe in careless joy while dashing off the dew.\n  Bobolink in maple high----'\n\n\"Of course you can see for yourself that they're not.  There isn't a\nsingle one of them higher than a fence post.  The person who wrote the\npiece had to put it that way so high would rhyme with reply, which is\ncoming in the next line.\"\n\n\"I see!\" said the Princess.\n\n  \"'Bobolink in maple high, trills a note of glee\n  Farmer boy a gay reply now whistles cheerily.'\n\n\n\"Then you whistle the chorus like you did it.\"\n\n\"You do indeed!\" said the Princess.  \"Proceed!\"\n\n  \"'Then the farmer boy at noon, rests beneath the shade,\n  Listening to the ceaseless tune that's thrilling through the glade.\n  Long and loud the harvest fly winds his bugle round,\n  Long, and loud, and shrill, and high, he whistles back the sound.'\"\n\n\n\"He does!  He does indeed!  I haven't a doubt about that!\" cried the\nPrincess.  \"'Long, and loud, and shrill, and high,' he whistles over\nand over the sound, until it becomes maddening.  Is that all of that\nmelodious, entrancing production?\"\n\n\"No, evening comes yet.  The last verse goes this way:\n\n  \"'When the busy day's employ, ends at dewy eve,\n  Then the happy farmer boy, doth haste his work to leave,\n  Trudging down the quiet lane, climbing o'er the hill,\n  Whistling back the changeless wail, of plaintive whip-poor-will,'--\n\nand then you do the chorus again, and if you know how well enough you\nwhistle in, 'whip-poor-will,' 'til the birds will answer you.  Laddie\noften makes them.\"\n\n\"My life!\" cried the Princess.  \"Was that he doing those bird cries?\nWhy, I hunted, and hunted, and so did father.  We'd never seen a\nwhip-poor-will.  Just fancy us!\"\n\n\"If you'd only looked at Laddie,\" I said.\n\n\"My patience!\" cried the Princess.  \"Looked at him!  There was no place\nto look without seeing him.  And that ear-splitting thing will ring in\nmy head forever, I know.\"\n\n\"Did he whistle it too high to suit you, Princess?\"\n\n\"He was perfectly welcome to whistle as he chose,\" she said, \"and also\nto plow with the carriage horses, and to bedeck them and himself with\nthe modest, shrinking red tulip and yellow daffodil.\"\n\nNow any one knows that tulips and daffodils are NOT modest and\nshrinking.  If any flowers just blaze and scream colour clear across a\ngarden, they do.  She was provoked, you could see that.\n\n\"Well, he only did it to please you,\" I said.  \"He didn't care anything\nabout it.  He never plowed that way before.  But you said he mustn't\nplow at all, and he just had to plow, there was no escaping that, so he\nmade it as fine and happy as possible to show you how nicely it could\nbe done.\"\n\n\"Greatly obliged, I'm sure!\" cried the Princess.  \"He showed me!  He\ncertainly did!  And so he feels that there's 'no escaping' plowing,\ndoes he?\"\n\nThen I knew where I was.  I'd have given every cent of mine in father's\nchest till, if mother had been in my place.  Once, for a second, I\nthought I'd ask the Princess to go with me to the house, and let mother\ntell her how it was; but if she wouldn't go, and rode away, I felt I\ncouldn't endure it, and anyway, she had said she was looking for me; so\nI gripped the shingle, dug in my toes and went at her just as nearly\nlike mother talked to her father as I could remember, and I'd been put\nthrough memory tests, and descriptive tests, nearly every night of my\nlife, so I had most of it as straight as a string.\n\n\"Well, you see, he CAN'T escape it,\" I said.  \"He'd do anything in all\nthis world for you that he possibly could; but there are some things no\nman CAN do.\"\n\n\"I didn't suppose there was anything you thought Laddie couldn't do,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"A little time back, I didn't,\" I answered.  \"But since he took the\ncarriage horses, trimmed up in flowers, and sang and whistled so\nbravely, day after day, when his heart was full of tears, why I learned\nthat there was something he just COULDN'T DO; NOT TO SAVE HIS LIFE, OR\nHIS LOVE, OR EVEN TO SAVE YOU.\"\n\n\"And of course you don't mind telling me what that is?\" coaxed the\nPrincess in her most wheedling tones.\n\n\"Not at all!  He told our family, and I heard him tell your father.\nThe thing he can't do, not even to win you, is to be shut up in a\nlittle office, in a city, where things roar, and smell, and nothing is\nlike this----\"\n\nI pointed out the orchard, hill, and meadow, so she looked where I\nshowed her--looked a long time.\n\n\"No, a city wouldn't be like this,\" she said slowly.\n\n\"And that isn't even the beginning,\" I said.  \"Maybe he could bear\nthat, men have been put in prison and lived through years and years of\nit, perhaps Laddie could too; I doubt it! but anyway the worst of it is\nthat he just couldn't, not even to save you, spend all the rest of his\nlife trying to settle other people's old fusses.  He despises a fuss.\nNot one of us ever in our lives have been able to make him quarrel,\neven one word.  He simply won't.  And if he possibly could be made to\nby any one on earth, Leon would have done it long ago, for he can start\na fuss with the side of a barn.  But he can't make Laddie fuss, and\nnobody can.  He NEVER would at school, or anywhere.  Once in a while if\na man gets so overbearing that Laddie simply can't stand it, he says:\n'Now, you'll take your medicine!'  Then he pulls off his coat, and\ncarefully, choosing the right spots, he just pounds the breath out of\nthat man, but he never stops smiling, and when he helps him up he\nalways says:  'Sorry! hope you'll excuse me, but you WOULD have it.'\nThat's what he said about you, that you had to take your medicine----\"\n\nI made a mistake there.  That made her too mad for any use.\n\n\"Oh,\" she cried, \"I do? I'll jolly well show the gentleman!\"\n\n\"Oh, you needn't take the trouble,\" I cried.  \"He's showing you!\"\n\nShe just blazed like she'd break into flame.  Any one could fuss with\nher all right; but that was the last thing on earth I wanted to do.\n\n\"You see he already knows about you,\" I explained as fast as I could\ntalk, for I was getting into an awful mess.  \"You see he knows that you\nwant him to be a lawyer, and that he must quit plowing before he can be\nmore than friends with you.  That's what he's plowing for!  If it\nwasn't for that, probably he wouldn't; be plowing at all.  He asked\nfather to let him, and he borrowed mother's horses, and he hooked the\nflowers through the fence.  Every night when he comes home, he kneels\nbeside mother and asks her if he is 'repulsive,' and she takes him in\nher arms and the tears roll down her cheeks and she says:  'Father has\nfarmed all his life, and you know how repulsive he is.'\"\n\nI ventured an upward peep.  I was doing better.  Her temper seemed to\nbe cooling, but her face was a jumble.  I couldn't find any one thing\non it that would help me, so I just stumbled ahead guessing at what to\nsay.\n\n\"He didn't WANT to do it.  He perfectly HATED it.  Those fields were\nhis Waterloo.  Every furrow was a FIGHT, but he was FORCED to show you.\"\n\n\"Exactly WHAT was he trying to show me?\"\n\n\"I can think of three things he told me,\" I answered.  \"That plowing\ncould be so managed as not to disfigure the landscape----\"\n\n\"The dunce!\" she said.\n\n\"That he could plow or do dirtier work, and not be repulsive----\"\n\n\"The idiot!\" she said.\n\n\"That if he came over there, and plowed right under your nose, when\nyou'd told him he mustn't, or he couldn't be more than friends; and\nwhen you knew that he'd much rather die and be laid beside the little\nsisters up there in the cemetery than to NOT be more than friends, why,\nyou'd see, if he did THAT, he couldn't help it, that he just MUST.\nThat he was FORCED----\"\n\n\"The soldier!\" she said.\n\n\"Oh Princess, he didn't want to!\" I cried.  \"He tells me secrets he\ndoesn't any one else, unless you.  He told me how he hated it; but he\njust had to do it.\"\n\n\"Do you know WHY?\"\n\n\"Of course!  It's the way he's MADE!  Father is like that!  He has\nchances to live in cities, make big business deals, and go to the\nlegislature at Indianapolis; I've seen his letters from his friend\nOliver P. Morton, our Governor, you know; they're in his chest till\nnow; but father can't do it, because he is made so he stays at home and\nworks for us, and this farm, and township, and county where he belongs.\nHe says if all men will do that the millennium will come to-morrow.  I\n'spose you know what the millennium is?\"\n\n\"I do!\" said the Princess.  \"But I don't know what your father and his\nfriend Oliver P. Morton have to do with Laddie.\"\n\n\"Why, everything on earth!  Laddie is father's son, you see, and he is\nmade like father.  None of our other boys is.  Not one of them loves\nland.  Leon is going away as quick as ever he finishes college; but the\nmore you educate Laddie, the better he likes to make things grow, the\nmore he loves to make the world beautiful, to be kind to every one, to\ngentle animals--why, the biggest fight he ever had, the man he whipped\n'til he most couldn't bring him back again, was one who kicked his\nhorse in the stomach.  Gee, I thought he'd killed him!  Laddie did too\nfor a while, but he only said the man deserved it.\"\n\n\"And so he did!\" cried the Princess angrily.  \"How beastly!\"\n\n\"That's one reason Laddie sticks so close to land.  He says he doesn't\nmeet nearly so many two-legged beasts in the country.  Almost every\ntime he goes to town he either gets into a fight or he sees something\nthat makes him fighting mad.  Princess, you think this beautiful, don't\nyou?\"\n\nI just pointed anywhere.  All the world was in it that morning.  You\ncouldn't look right or left and not see lovely places, hear music, and\nsmell flowers.\n\n\"Yes!  It is altogether wonderful!\" she said.\n\n\"Would you like to live among this all your life, and have your plans\nmade to fix you a place even nicer, and then be forced to leave it and\ngo to a little room in the city, and make all the money you earned off\nof how much other men fight over business, and land and such perfectly\nawful things, that they always have to be whispered when Jerry tells\nabout them?  Would you?\"\n\n\"You little dunce!\" she cried.\n\n\"I know I'm a fool.  I know I'm not telling you a single thing I\nshould!  Maybe I'm hurting Laddie far more than I'm helping him, and if\nI am, I wish I would die before I see him; but oh!  Princess, I'm\ntrying with all my might to make you understand how he feels.  He WANTS\nto do every least thing you'd like him to.  He will, almost any thing\nelse in the world, he would this--he would in a minute, but he just\nCAN'T.  All of us know he can't!  If you'd lived with him since he was\nlittle and always had known him, you wouldn't ask him to; you wouldn't\nwant him to!  You don't know what you're doing!  Mother says you don't!\nYou'll kill him if you send him to the city to live, you just will!\nYou are doing it now!  He's getting thinner and whiter every day.\nDon't!  Oh please don't do it!\"\n\nThe Princess was looking at the world.  She was gazing at it so\ndazed-like she seemed to be surprised at what she saw.  She acted as if\nshe'd never really seen it before.  She looked and she looked.  She\neven turned her horse a full circle to see all of it, and she went\naround slowly.  I stepped from one foot to the other and sweat; but I\nkept quiet and let her look.  At last when she came around, she glanced\ndown at me, and she was all melted, and lovely as any one you ever saw,\nexactly like Shelley at Christmas, and she said:  \"I don't think I ever\nsaw the world before.  I don't know that I'm so crazy about a city\nmyself, and I perfectly hate lawyers.  Come to thing of it, a lawyer\nhelped work ruin in our family, and I never have believed, I never will\nbelieve----\"\n\nShe stopped talking and began looking again.  I gave her all the time\nshe needed.  I was just straining to be wise, for mother says it takes\nthe very wisest person there is to know when to talk, and when to keep\nstill.  As I figured it, now was the time not to say another word until\nshe made up her mind about what I had told her already.  If Pryors\ndidn't know what we thought of them by that time, it wasn't mother's\nfault or mine.  As she studied things over she kept on looking.  What\nshe saw seemed to be doing her a world of good.  Her face showed it\nevery second plainer and plainer.  Pretty soon it began to look like\nshe was going to come through as Amos Hurd did when he was redeemed.\nThen, before my very eyes, it happened!  I don't know how I ever held\non to the pie or kept from shouting, \"Praise the Lord!\" as father does\nat the Meeting House when he is happiest.  Then she leaned toward me\nall wavery, and shining eyed, and bloomful, and said:  \"Did you ever\nhurt Laddie's feelings, and make him angry and sad?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I never did,\" I answered.\n\n\"But suppose you had!  What would you do?\"\n\n\"Do?  Why, I'd go to him on the run, and I'd tell him I never intended\nto hurt his feelings, and how sorry I was, and I'd give him the very\nbest kiss I could.\"\n\nThe Princess stroked Maud's neck a long time and thought while she\nstudied our farm, theirs beyond it, and at the last, the far field\nwhere Laddie was plowing.  She thought, and thought, and afraid to\ncheep, I stood gripping the shingle and waited.  Finally she said:\n\"The last time Laddie was at our house, I said to him those things he\nrepeated to you.  He went away at once, hurt and disappointed.  Now, if\nyou like, along with your precious pie, you may carry him this message\nfrom me.  You may tell him that I said I am sorry!\"\n\nI could have cried \"Glory!\" and danced and shouted there in the road,\nbut I didn't.  It was no time to lose my head.  That was all so fine\nand splendid, as far as it went, but it didn't quite cover the case.  I\nnever could have done it for myself; but for Laddie I would venture\nanything, so I looked her in the eyes, straight as a dart, and said:\n\"He'd want the kiss too, Princess!\"\n\nYou could see her stiffen in the saddle and her fingers grip the reins,\nbut I kept on staring right into her eyes.\n\n\"I could come up, you know,\" I offered.\n\nA dull red flamed in her cheeks and her lips closed tight.  One second\nshe sat very still, then a dancing light leaped sparkling into her\neyes; a flock of dimples chased each other around her lips like\nswallows circling their homing place at twilight.\n\n\"What about that wonderful pie?\" she asked me.\n\nI ran to the nearest fence corner, and laid the shingle on the gnarled\nroots of a Johnny Appleseed apple tree.  Then I set one foot on the\narch of the Princess' instep and held up my hands.  One second I\nthought she would not lift me, the next I was on her level and her lips\nmet mine in a touch like velvet woven from threads of flame.  Then with\na turn of her stout little wrist, she dropped me, and a streak went up\nour road.  Nothing so amazing and so important ever had happened to me.\nIt was an occasion that demanded something unusual.  To cry, \"Praise\nthe Lord!\" was only to repeat an hourly phrase at our house; this\ndemanded something out of the ordinary, so I said just exactly as\nfather did the day the brown mare balked with the last load of seed\nclover, when a big storm was breaking--\"Jupiter Ammon!\"\n\nWhen I had calmed down so I could, I climbed the fence, and reached\nthrough a crack for the pie.  As I followed the cool, damp furrow, and\nLaddie's whistle, clear as the lark's above the wheat, thrilled me, I\nwas almost insane with joy.  Just joy!  Pure joy!  Oh what a good world\nit was!--most of the time!  Most of the time!  Of course, there WERE\nPaget men in it.  But anyway, THIS couldn't be beaten.  I had a message\nfor Laddie from the Princess that would send him to the seventh heaven,\nwherever that was; no one at our house spent any time thinking farther\nthan the first one.  I had her kiss, that I didn't know what would do\nto him, and I also had a big piece of juicy rhubarb pie not yet\nentirely cold.  If that didn't wipe out the trouble I had made showing\nthe old crest thing, nothing ever could.  I knew even then, that men\nwere pretty hard to satisfy, but I was quite certain that Laddie would\nbe satisfied that morning.  As I hurried along I wondered whether it\nwould be better to give him my gift first, or the Princess'.  I decided\nthat joy would keep, while the pie was cold enough, with all the time I\nhad stopped; and if I told him about her first, maybe he wouldn't touch\nit at all, and it wasn't so easy as it looked to carry it to him and\nnever even once stick in my finger for the tiniest lick--joy would\nkeep; but I was going to feed him; so with shining face, I offered the\npie and stood back to see just how happy I could get.\n\n\"Mother send it?\" asked Laddie.\n\nPeople were curious that morning, as if I had a habit of stealing pie.\nI only took pieces of cut ones from the cellar when mother didn't care.\nSo I explained again that Candace gave it to me, and I was free to\nbring it.\n\n\"Oh I see!\" said Laddie.\n\nAfter nearly two weeks of work, the grays had sobered down enough to\nstand without tying; so he wound the lines around the plow handle, sat\non the beam, and laid aside his hat, having a fresh flower in the band.\nOnce he started a thing, he just simply wouldn't give up.  He\nunbuttoned his neckband until I could see his throat where it was white\nlike a woman's, took out his knife and ate that pie.  Of course we knew\nbetter than to use a knife at the table, but there was no other way in\nthe field.  He ate that pie, slowly and deliberately, and between bites\nhe talked.  I watched him with a wide grin, wondering what in this\nworld he WOULD say, in a minute.  I don't think I ever had quite such a\ngood time in all my life before, and I never expect to again.  He was\nsaying:  \"Talk about nectar and ambrosia!  Talk about the feasts of\nLucullus!  Talk about food for the Gods!\"\n\nI put on his hat, sat on the ground in front of him, and was the\nhappiest girl in the world, of that I am quite sure.  When the last\nmorsel was finished, Laddie looked at me steadily.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he said, \"I wonder if there's another man in the world who\nis blest with quite such a loving, unselfish little sister as mine?\"\nThen he answered himself:  \"No!  By all the Gods, ant half-Gods, I\nswear it--No!\"\n\nIt was grand as a Fourth of July oration or the most exciting part when\nthe Bishop dedicated our church.  I couldn't hold in another second, I\ncould hear my heart beat.\n\n\"Oh Laddie!\" I shouted, jumping up, \"that pie is only the beginning of\nthe good things I have brought you.  I have a message, and a gift\nbesides, Laddie!\"\n\n\"A message and a gift?\" Laddie repeated.  \"What!  More?\"\n\n\"Truly I have a message and a gift for you,\" I cried, \"and Laddie--they\nare from the Princess!\"\n\nHis eyes raised to mine now, and slowly he turned Sabethany-like.\n\n\"From the Princess!\" he exclaimed.  \"A message and a gift for me,\nLittle Sister?  You never would let Leon put you up to serve me a\ntrick?\"\n\nThat hurt.  He should have KNOWN I wouldn't, and besides, \"Leon feels\njust as badly about this as any of us,\" I said.  \"Have you forgotten he\noffered to plow, and let you do the clean, easy work?\"\n\n\"Forgive me!  I'm overanxious,\" said Laddie, his arms reaching for me.\n\"Go on and tell carefully, and if you truly love me, don't make a\nmistake!\"\n\nCrowding close, my arms around his neck, his crisp hair against my\nlips, I whispered my story softly, for this was such a fine and\nsplendid secret, that not even the shining blackbirds, and the pert\nrobins in the furrows were going to get to hear a word of it.  Before I\nhad finished Laddie was breathing as Flos does when he races her the\nlimit.  He sat motionless for a long time, while over his face slowly\ncrept a beauty that surpassed that of Apollo in his Greek book.\n\n\"And her gift?\"\n\nIt was only a breath.\n\n\"She helped me up, and she sent you this,\" I answered.\n\nThen I set my lips on his, and held them there a second, trying my\nlevel best to give him her very kiss, but of course I could only try.\n\n\"Oh, Laddie,\" I cried.  \"Her eyes were like when stars shine down in\nour well!  Her cheeks were like mother's damask roses!  She smelled\nlike flowers, and when her lips touched mine little stickers went all\nover me!\"\n\nThen Laddie's arms closed around me and I thought sure every bone in my\nbody was going to be broken; when he finished there wasn't a trace of\nthat kiss left for me.  Remembering it would be all I'd ever have.  It\nmade me see what would have happened to the Princess if she had been\nthere; and it was an awful pity for her to miss it, because he'd sober\ndown a lot before he reached her, but I was sure as shooting that he\nwouldn't be so crazy as to kiss her hands again.  Peter wasn't a\npatching to him!\n\nThat night Laddie rode to Pryors'.  When he brought Flos to the gate\nyou could see the shadow of your face on her shining flank; her mane\nand tail were like ravelled silk, her hoofs bright as polished horn,\nand her muzzle was clean as a ribbon.  I broke one of those rank green\nsprouts from the snowball bush and brushed away the flies, so she\nwouldn't fret, stamp, and throw dust on herself.  Then Laddie came,\nfresh from a tubbing, starched linen, dressed in his new riding suit,\nand wearing top hat and gauntlets.  He looked the very handsomest I\never had seen him; and at the same time, he seemed trembling with\ntenderness, and bursting with power.  Goodness sake!  I bet the\nPrincess took one good look and \"came down\" like Davy Crockett's coon.\nMother was on his arm and she walked clear to the gate with him.\n\n\"LADDIE, ARE YOU SURE ENOUGH TO GO?\" I heard her ask him whisper-like.\n\n\"SURE AS DEATH!\" Laddie answered.\n\nMother looked, and she had to see how it was with him; no doubt she saw\nmore than I did from having been through it herself, so she smiled kind\nof a half-sad, half-glad smile.  Then she turned to her damask rose\nbush, the one Lucy brought her from the city, and that she was so\nprecious about, that none of us dared touch it, and she searched all\nover it and carefully selected the most perfect rose.  When she\nborrowed Laddie's knife and cut the stem as long as my arm, I knew\nexactly how great and solemn the occasion was; for always before about\nsix inches had been her limit.  She held it toward him, smiling bravely\nand beautifully, but the tears were running straight down her cheeks.\n\n\"Take it to her,\" she said.  \"I think, my son, it is very like.\"\n\nLaddie took her in his arms and wiped away the tears; he told her\neverything would come out all right about God, and the mystery, even.\nThen he picked me clear off the ground, and he tried to see how near he\ncould come to cracking every bone in my body without really doing it,\nand he kissed me over and over.  It hadn't been so easy, but I guess\nyou'll admit that paid.  Then he rode away with the damask rose waving\nover his heart.  Mother and I stood beside the hitching rack and looked\nafter him, with our arms tight around each other while we tried to see\nwhich one could bawl the hardest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nThe Homing Pigeon\n\n  \"A millstone and the human heart,\n  Are ever driven round,\n  And if they've nothing else to grind,\n  They must themselves be ground.\"\n\n\nIt seemed to me that my mother was the person who really could have\nbeen excused for having heart trouble.  The more I watched her, the\nmore I wondered that she didn't.  There was her own life, the one she\nand father led, where everything went exactly as she wanted it to; and\nif there had been only themselves to think of, no people on earth could\nhave lived happier, unless the pain she sometimes suffered made them\ntrouble, and I don't think it would, for neither of them were to blame\nfor that.  They couldn't help it.  They just had it to stand, and fight\nthe stiffest they could to cure it, and mother always said she was\nbetter; every single time any one asked, she was better.  I hoped soon\nit would all be gone.  Then they could have been happy for sure, if\nsome of us hadn't popped up and kept them in hot water all the time.\n\nI can't tell you about Laddie when he came back from Pryors'.  He tore\ndown the house, then tore it up, and then threw around the pieces, and\nnone of us cared.  Every one was just laughing, shouting, and every bit\nas pleased as he was, while I was the Queen Bee.  Laddie said so,\nhimself, and if he didn't know, no one did.  Pryors had been lovely to\nhim.  When mother asked him how he made it, he answered:  \"I rode over,\npicked up the Princess and helped myself.  After I finished, I\nremembered the little unnecessary formality of asking her to marry me;\nand she said right out loud that she WOULD.  When I had time for them,\nI reached Father and Mother Pryor, and maybe it doesn't show, but\nsomewhere on my person I carry their blessing, genially and heartily\ngiven, I am proud to state.  Now, I'm only needing yours, to make me a\nking among men.\"\n\nThey gave it quite as willingly, I am sure, although you could see\nmother scringe when Laddie said \"Father and Mother Pryor.\"  I knew why.\nShe adored Laddie, like the Bible says you must adore the Almighty.\nFrom a tiny baby Laddie had taken care of her.  He used to go back,\ntake her hand, and try to help her over rough places while he still\nwore dresses.  Straight on, he had been like that; always seeing when\nthere was too much work and trying to shield her; always knowing when a\npain was coming and fighting to head it off; always remembering the\nthings the others forgot, going to her last at night, and his face\nagainst hers on her pillow the first in the morning, to learn how she\nwas before he left the house.  If you were the mother of a man like\nthat, how would you like to hear him call some one else mother, and\nhave the word slip from his tongue so slick you could see he didn't\neven realize that he had used it?  The answer would be, if you were\nhonest, that you wouldn't have liked it any more than she did.  She\nknew he had to go.  She wanted him to be happy.  She was as sure of the\nman he was going to be as she was sure of the mercy of God.  That is\nthe strongest way I know to tell it.  She was unshakably sure of the\nmercy of God, but I wasn't.  There were times when it seemed as if He\ncouldn't hear the most powerful prayer you could pray, and when instead\nof mercy, you seemed to get the last torment that could be piled on.\nTake right now.  Laddie was happy, and all of us were, in a way; and in\nanother we were almost stiff with misery.\n\nI dreaded his leaving us so, I would slip to the hawk oak and cry\nmyself sick, more than once; whether any of the others were that big\nbabies I don't know; but anyway, THEY were not his Little Sister.  I\nwas.  I always had been.  I always would be, for that matter; but there\nwas going to be a mighty big difference.  I had the poor comfort that\nI'd done the thing myself.  Maybe if it hadn't been for stopping the\nPrincess when I took him that pie, they never would have made up, and\nshe might have gone across the sea and stayed there.  Maybe she'd go\nyet, as mysteriously as she had come, and take him along.  Sometimes I\nalmost wished I hadn't tried to help him; but of course I didn't\nreally.  Then, too, I had sense enough to know that loving each other\nas they did, they wouldn't live on that close together for years and\nyears, and not find a way to make up for themselves, like they had at\nthe start.\n\nI liked Laddie saying I had made his happiness for him; but I wasn't\nsuch a fool that I didn't know he could have made it for himself just\nas well, and no doubt better.  So everything was all right with Laddie;\nand what happened to us, the day he rode away for the last time, when\nhe went to stay--what happened to us, then, was our affair.  We had to\ntake it, but every one of us dreaded it, while mother didn't know how\nto bear it, and neither did I.  Once I said to her:  \"Mother, when\nLaddie goes we'll just have to make it up to each other the best we\ncan, won't we?\"\n\n\"Oh my soul, child!\" she cried, staring at me so surprised-like.  \"Why,\nhow unspeakably selfish I have been!  No little lost sheep ever ran\nthis farm so desolate as you will be without your brother.  Forgive me\nbaby, and come here!\"\n\nGee, but we did cry it out together!  The God she believed in has wiped\naway her tears long ago; this minute I can scarcely see the paper for\nmine.  If you could call anything happiness, that was mixed with\nfeeling like that, why, then, we were happy about Laddie.  But from\nthings I heard father and mother say, I knew they could have borne his\ngoing away, and felt a trifle better than they did.  I was quite sure\nthey had stopped thinking that he was going to lose his soul, but they\ncouldn't help feeling so long as that old mystery hung over Pryors that\nhe might get into trouble through it.  Father said if it hadn't been\nfor Mr. Pryor's stubborn and perverted notions about God, he would like\nthe man immensely, and love to be friends; and if Laddie married into\nthe family we would have to be as friendly as we could anyway.  He said\nhe had such a high opinion of Mr. Pryor's integrity that he didn't\nbelieve he'd encourage Laddie to enter his family if it would involve\nthe boy in serious trouble.  Mother didn't know.  Anyway, the thing was\ndone, and by fall, no doubt, Laddie would leave us.\n\nJust when we were trying to keep a stiff upper lip before him, and\nwhistling as hard as ever he had, to brace our courage, a letter came\nfor mother from the head of the music school Shelley attended, saying\nshe was no longer fit for work, so she was being sent home at once, and\nthey would advise us to consult a specialist immediately.  Mother sat\nand stared at father, and father went to hitch the horses to drive to\nGroveville.\n\nThere's only one other day of my life that stands out as clearly as\nthat.  The house was clean as we could make it.  I finished feeding\nearly, and had most of the time to myself.  I went down to the Big\nHill, and followed the top of it to our woods.  Then I turned around,\nand started toward the road, just idling.  If I saw a lovely spot I sat\ndown and watched all around me to see if a Fairy really would go\nslipping past, or lie asleep under a leaf.  I peeked and peered softly,\ngoing from spot to spot, watching everything.  Sometimes I hung over\nthe water, and studied tiny little fish with red, yellow, and blue on\nthem, bright as flowers.  The dragonflies would alight right on me, and\nsome wore bright blue markings and some blood red.  There was a blue\nbeetle, a beautiful green fly, and how the blue wasps did flip, flirt\nand glint in the light.  So did the blackbirds and the redwings.  That\nembankment was left especially to shade the water, and to feed the\nbirds.  Every foot of it was covered with alders, wild cherry,\nhazelbush, mulberries, everything having a berry or nut.  There were\nseveral scrub apple trees, many red haws, the wild strawberries spread\nin big beds in places, and some of them were colouring.\n\nWild flowers grew everywhere, great beds were blue with calamus, and\nthe birds flocked in companies to drive away the water blacksnakes that\noften found nests, and liked eggs and bird babies.  When I came to the\nroad at last, the sun was around so the big oak on the top of the hill\nthrew its shadow across the bridge, and I lay along one edge and\nwatched the creek bottom, or else I sat up so the water flowed over my\nfeet, and looked at the embankment and the sky.  In a way, it was the\nmost peculiar day of my life.  I had plenty to think of, but I never\nthought at all.  I only lived.  I sat watching the world go past\nthrough a sort of golden haze the sun made.  When a pair of kingbirds\nand three crows chased one of my hawks pell-mell across the sky, I\nlooked on and didn't give a cent what happened.  When a big blacksnake\ndarted its head through sweet grass and cattails, and caught a frog\nthat had climbed on a mossy stone in the shade to dine on flies, I let\nit go.  Any other time I would have hunted a stick and made the snake\nlet loose.  To-day I just sat there and let things happen as they did.\n\nAt last I wandered up the road, climbed the back garden fence, and sat\non the board at the edge of a flowerbed, and to-day, I could tell to\nthe last butterfly about that garden: what was in bloom, how far things\nhad grown, and what happened.  Bobby flew under the Bartlett pear tree\nand crowed for me, but I never called him.  I sat there and lived on,\nand mostly watched the bees tumble over the bluebells.  They were\nalmost ready to be cut to put in the buttered tumblers for perfume,\nlike mother made for us.  Then I went into the house and looked at\nGrace Greenwood, but I didn't take her along.  Mother came past and\ngave me a piece of stiff yellow brocaded silk as lovely as I ever had\nseen, enough for a dress skirt; and a hand-embroidered chemise sleeve\nthat only needed a band and a button to make a petticoat for a Queen\ndoll, but I laid them away and wandered into the orchard.\n\nI dragged my bare feet through the warm grass, and finally sat under\nthe beet red peach tree.  If ever I seemed sort of lost and sorry for\nmyself, that was a good place to go; it was so easy to feel abused\nthere because you didn't dare touch those peaches.  Fluffy baby\nchickens were running around, but I didn't care; there was more than a\nbird for every tree, bluebirds especially; they just loved us and came\nearly and stayed late, and grew so friendly they nested all over the\nwood house, smoke house, and any place we fixed for them, and in every\nhollow apple limb.  Bobby came again, but I didn't pay any attention to\nhim.\n\nThen I heard the carriage cross the bridge.  I knew when it was father,\nevery single time his team touched the first plank.  So I ran like an\nIndian, and shinned up a cedar tree, scratching myself until I bled.\nAway up I stood on a limb, held to the tree and waited.  Father drove\nto the gate, and mother came out, with May, Candace, and Leon\nfollowing.  When Shelley touched the ground and straightened, any other\ntree except a spruce having limbs to hold me up, I would have fallen\nfrom it.  She looked exactly as if she had turned to tombstone with\neyes and hair alive.  She stopped a second to brush a little kiss\nacross mother's lips, to the others she said without even glancing at\nthem:  \"Oh do let me lie down a minute!  The motion of that train made\nme sick.\"\n\nWell, I should say it did!  I quit living, and began thinking in a\nhooray, and so did every one else at our house.  Once I had been sick\nand queened it over them for a while, now all of us strained ourselves\ntrying to wait on Shelley; but she wouldn't have it.  She only said she\nwas tired to death, to let her rest, and she turned her face to the\nwall and lay there.  Once she said she never wanted to see a city again\nso long as she lived.  When mother told her about Laddie and the\nPrincess to try to interest her, she never said a word; I doubted if\nshe even listened.  Father and mother looked at each other, when they\nthought no one would see, and their eyes sent big, anxious questions\nflashing back and forth.  I made up my mind I'd keep awake that night\nand hear what they said, if I had to take pins to bed with me and stick\nmyself.\n\nOnce mother said to Shelley that she was going to send for Dr. Fenner,\nand she answered:  \"All right, if you need him.  Don't you dare for me!\nI'll not see him.  All I want is a little peace and rest.\"\n\nThe idea!  Not one of us ever had spoken to mother like that before in\nall our born days.  I held my breath to see what she would do, but she\ndidn't seem to have heard it, or to notice how rude it had been.  Well,\nTHAT told about as plain as anything what we had on our hands.  I\nwandered around and NOW there was no trouble about thinking things.\nThey came in such a jumble I could get no sense from them; but one big\nblack thought came over, and over, and over, and wouldn't be put away.\nIt just stood, stayed, forced you, and made you look it in the face.\nIf Shelley weren't stopped quickly she was going up on the hill with\nthe little fever and whooping cough sisters.  There it was!  You could\ntry to think other things, to play, to work, to talk it down in the\npulpit, to sing it out in a tree, to slide down the haystack away from\nit--there it stayed!  And every glimpse you had of Shelley made it\nsurer.\n\nThere was no trouble about keeping awake that night; I couldn't sleep.\nI stood at the window and looked down the Big Hill through the soft\nwhite moonlight, and thought about it, and then I thought of mother.  I\nguess NOW you see what kind of things mothers have to face.  All day\nshe had gone around doing her work, every few minutes suggesting some\nnew thing for one of us to try, or trying it herself; all day she had\ntalked and laughed, and when Sarah Hood came she told her she thought\nShelley must be bilious, that she had travelled all night and was\nsleeping: but she would be up the first place she went, and then they\ntalked all over creation and Mrs. Hood went home and never remembered\nthat she hadn't seen Shelley.  She worked Mrs. Freshett off the same\nway, but you could see she was almost too tired to do it, so by night\nshe was nearly as white as Shelley, yet keeping things going.  When the\nhouse was still, she came into the room, and stood at the window as I\nhad, until father entered, then she turned, and I could see they were\nstaring at each other in the moonlight, as they had all day.\n\n\"She's sick?\" asked father, at last.\n\n\"Heartsick!\" said mother bitterly.\n\n\"We'd better have Doc come?\"\n\n\"She says she isn't sick, and she won't see him.\"\n\n\"She will if I put my foot down.\"\n\n\"Best not, Paul!  She'll feel better soon.  She's so young!  She must\nget over it.\"\n\nThey were silent for a long time and then father asked in a harsh\nwhisper:  \"Ruth, can she possibly have brought us to shame?\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" cried mother.  \"Let us pray.\"\n\nThen those two people knelt on each side of that bed, and I could hear\nhalf the words they muttered, until I was wild enough to scream.  I\nwished with all my heart that I hadn't listened.  I had always known it\nwas no nice way.  I must have gone to sleep after a while, but when I\nwoke up I was still thinking about it, and to save me, I couldn't quit.\nAll day, wherever I went, that question of father's kept going over in\nmy head.  I thought about it until I was almost crazy, and I just\ncouldn't see where anything about shame came in.\n\nShe was only mistaken.  She THOUGHT he loved her, and he didn't.  She\nnever could have been so bloomy, so filled with song, laughter, and\nlovely like she was, if she hadn't truly believed with all her heart\nthat he loved her.  Of course it would almost finish her to give him\nup, when she felt like that; and maybe she did wrong to let herself\ncare so much, before she was sure about him; but that would only be\nfoolish, there wouldn't be even a shadow of shame about it.  Besides,\nLaddie had done exactly the same thing.  He loved the Princess until it\nnearly killed him when he thought he had to give her up, and he loved\nher as hard as ever he could, when he hadn't an idea whether she would\nlove him back, even a tiny speck; and the person who wasn't foolish,\nand never would be, was Laddie.\n\nThe more I thought, the worse I got worked up, and I couldn't see how\nShelley was to blame for anything at all.  Love just came to her, like\nit came to Laddie.  She would hardly have knelt down and beseeched the\nLord to make her fall in love with a man she scarcely knew, and when\nshe couldn't be sure what he was going to do about it--not the Lord,\nthe man, I mean.  You could see for yourself she wouldn't do that.  I\nfinished my work, and then I tried to do things for her, and she\nwouldn't let me.  Mother told me to ask her to make Grace Greenwood the\ndress she had promised when I was so sick; so I took the Scotch plaid\nto her and reminded her, and she pushed me away and said:  \"Some time!\"\n\nI even got Grace, and showed Shelley the spills on her dress, and how\nbadly she needed a new one, but she never looked, she said: \"Oh bother!\nMy head aches.  Do let me be!\"\n\nMother was listening.  I could see her standing outside the door.\n\nShe motioned to me to come away, so I went to her and she was white as\nShelley.  She was sick too, she couldn't say a word for a minute, but\nafter a while she kissed me, I could feel the quivers in her lips, and\nshe said stifflike:  \"Never mind, she'll be better soon, then she will!\nRun play now!\"\n\nSometimes I wandered around looking at things and living dully.  I\ndidn't try to study out anything, but I must have watched closer than I\nknew, for every single thing I saw then, over that whole farm, I can\nshut my eyes and see to-day; everything, from the old hawk tilting his\ntail to steer him in soaring, to a snake catching field mice in the\ngrass, lichens on the fence, flowers, butterflies, every single thing.\nMostly I sat to watch something that promised to become interesting,\nand before I knew it, I was back on the shame question.  That's the\nmost dreadful word in the dictionary.  There's something about it that\nmakes your face burn, only to have it in your mind.\n\nLaddie said he never had met any man who knew the origin of more words\nthan father.  He could even tell every clip what nationality a man was\nfrom his name.  Hundreds of time I have heard him say to stranger\npeople, \"From your name you'd be of Scotch extraction,\" or Irish, or\nwhatever it was, and every time the person he was talking with would\nsay, \"Yes.\"  Some day away out in the field, alone, I thought I would\nask him what people first used the word \"shame,\" and just exactly what\nit did mean, and what the things were that you could do that would make\nthe people who loved you until they would die for you, ashamed of you.\n\nThinking about that and planning out what it was that I wanted to know,\ngave me another idea.  Why not ask her?  She was the only one who knew\nwhat she had done away there in the city, alone among strangers; I\nwasn't sure whether all the music a girl could learn was worth letting\nher take the chances she would have to in a big city.  From the way\nLaddie and father hated them, they were a poor place for men, and they\nmust have been much worse for girls.  Shelley knew, why not ask HER?\nMaybe I could coax her to tell me, and it would make my life much\neasier to know; and only think what was going on in father's and\nmother's heads and hearts, when I felt that way, and didn't even know\nwhat there was to be ashamed about.  She wouldn't any more than slap\nme; and sick as she was, I made up my mind not to get angry at her, or\never to tell, if she did.  I'd rather have her hit me when she was so\nsick than to have Sally beat me until she couldn't strike another lick,\njust because she was angry.  But I forgave her that, and I was never\ngoing to think of it again--only I did.\n\nMother kept sending Leon to the post-office, and she met him at the\ngate half the time herself and fairly snatched the letters from his\nhands.  Hum!  She couldn't pull the wool over my eyes.  I knew she\nhoped somehow, some way, there would be a big fat one with Paget, Legal\nAdviser, or whatever a Chicago lawyer puts on his envelopes.  Jerry's\njust say:  \"Attorney at Law.\"\n\nNo letter ever came that had Paget in the corner, or anything happened\nthat did Shelley any good.  Far otherwise!  Just before supper Leon\ncame from Groveville one evening, and all of us could see at a glance\nthat he had been crying like a baby.  He had wiped up, and was trying\nto hold in, but he was killed, next.  I nearly said, \"Well, for\nheaven's sake, another!\" when I saw him.  He slammed down a big, long\nenvelope, having printing on it, before father, and glared at it as if\nhe wanted to tear it to smithereens, and he said:  \"If you want to know\nwhy it looks like that, I buried it under a stone once; but I had to go\nback, and then I threw it as far as I could send it, into Ditton's\ngully, but after a while I hunted it up again!\"\n\nThen he keeled over on the couch mother keeps for her in the\ndining-room, and sobbed until he looked like he'd come apart.\n\nOf course all of us knew exactly what that letter was from the way he\nacted.  Mother had told him, time and again, not to set his heart so;\nfather had, too and Laddie, and every one of us, but that little\nhalf-Arab, half-Kentucky mare was the worst temptation a man who loved\nhorses could possibly have; and while father and mother stopped at good\nwork horses, and matched roadsters for the carriage, they managed to\nprize and tend them so that every one of us had been born horse-crazy,\nand we had been allowed to ride, care for, and taught to love horses\nall our lives.  Treat a horse ugly, and we'd have gone on the thrashing\nfloor ourselves.\n\nFather laid the letter face down, his hand on it, and shook his head.\n\"This is too bad!\" he said.  \"It's a burning shame, but the money, the\nexact amount, was taken from a farmer in Medina County, Ohio, by a\ntraveller he sheltered a few days, because he complained of a bad foot.\nThe description of the man who robbed us is perfect.  The money was\nfrom the sale of some prize cattle.  It will have to be returned.\"\n\n\"Just let me see the letter a minute,\" said Laddie.\n\nHe read it over thoughtfully.  He was long enough about it to have gone\nover it three times; then he looked at Leon, and his forehead creased\nin a deep frown.  The tears slid down mother's cheeks, but she didn't\nknow it, or else she'd have wiped them away.  She was never mussy about\nthe least little thing.\n\n\"Father!\" she said.  \"Father----!\"\n\nThat was as far as she could go.\n\n\"The man must have his money,\" said father, \"but we'll look into\nthis----\"\n\nHe pushed back the plates and tablecloth, and cleared his end of the\ntable.  Mother never budged to stack the plates, or straighten the\ncloth so it wouldn't be wrinkled.  Then father brought his big account\nbook from the black walnut chest in our room, some little books, and\npapers, sharpened a pencil and began going up and down the columns and\npicking out figures here and there that he set on a piece of paper.  I\nnever had seen him look either old or tired before; but he did then.\nMother noticed it too, for her lips tightened, she lifted her head,\nwiped her eyes, and pretended that she felt better.  Laddie said\nsomething about doing the feeding, and slipped out.  Just then Shelley\ncame into the room, stopped, and looked questioningly at us.  Her eyes\nopened wide, and she stared hard at Leon.\n\n\"Why what ails him?\" she asked mother.\n\n\"You remember what I wrote you about a man who robbed us, and the money\nLeon was to have, provided no owner was found in a reasonable time; and\nthe horse the boy had planned to buy, and how he had been going to\nPryors'--Oh, I think he's slipped over there once a day, and often\nthree times, all this spring!  Mr. Pryor encouraged him, let him take\nhis older horses to practise on, even went out and taught him\ncross-country riding himself----\"\n\n\"I remember!\" said Shelley.\n\nLeon sobbed out loud.  Shelley crossed the room swiftly, dropped beside\nhim and whispered something in his ear.  Quick as a shot his arm\nreached out and went around her.  She hid her head deep in the pillow\nbeside him, and they went to pieces together.  Clear to pieces!  Pretty\nsoon father had to take off his glasses and wipe them so he could see\nthe figures.  Mother took one long look at him, a short one at Leon and\nShelley, then she arose, her voice as even and smooth, and she said:\n\"While you figure, father, I'll see about supper.  I have tried to plan\nan extra good one this evening.\"\n\nShe left the room.  NOW, I guess you know about all I can tell you of\nmother!  I can't see that there's a thing left.  That was the kind of\nsoldier she was.  Talk about Crusaders, and a good fight!  All the\nblood of battle in our family wasn't on father's side, not by any\nmeans!  The Dutch could fight too!\n\nFather's pencil scraped a little, a bee that had slipped in buzzed over\nthe apple butter, while the clock ticked as if it used a hammer.  It\nwas so loud one wanted to pitch it from the window.  May and I sat\nstill as mice when the cat is near.  Candace couldn't keep away from\nthe kitchen door to save her, and where mother went I hadn't an idea,\nbut she wasn't getting an extra good supper.  Shelley and Leon were\nquieter now.  May nudged me, and I saw that his arm around her was\ngripping her tight, while her hand on his head was patting him and\nfingering his hair.\n\nCa-lumph!  Ca-lumph! came the funniest sound right on the stone walk\nleading to the east door, then a shrill whicker that made father drop\nhis pencil.  Leon was on his feet, Shelley beside him, while at the\ndoor stood Laddie grinning as if his face would split, and with her\nforefeet on the step and her nose in the room, stood the prettiest, the\nvery prettiest horse I ever saw.  She was sticking her nose toward\nLeon, whinnying softly, as she lifted one foot, and if Laddie hadn't\nbacked her, she would have walked right into the dining-room.\n\n\"Come on, Weiscope, she's yours!\" said Laddie.  \"Take her to the barn,\nand put her in one of the cow stalls, until we fix a place for her.\"\n\nLeon crossed the room, but he never touched the horse.  He threw his\narms around Laddie's neck.\n\n\"Son!  Son!  Haven't you let your feelings run away with you?  What\ndoes this mean?\" asked father sternly.\n\n\"There's nothing remarkable in a big six-footer like me buying a\nhorse,\" said Laddie.  \"I expect to purchase a number soon, and without\na cent to pay, in the bargain.  I contracted to give five hundred\ndollars for this mare.  She is worth more; but that should be\nsatisfactory all around.  I am going to earn it by putting five of Mr.\nPryor's fancy, pedigreed horses in shape for market, taking them\npersonally, and selling them to men fit to own and handle real horses.\nI get one hundred each, and my expenses for the job.  I'll have as much\nfun doing it as I ever had at anything.  It suits me far better than\nplowing, even.\"\n\nMother entered the room at a sweep, and pushed Leon aside.\n\n\"Oh you man of my heart!\" she cried.  \"You man after my own heart!\"\n\nLaddie bent and kissed her, holding her tight as he looked over her\nhead at father.\n\n\"It's all right, of course?\" he said.\n\n\"I never have known of anything quite so altogether right,\" said\nfather.  \"Thank you, lad, and God bless you!\"\n\nHe took Laddie's hand, and almost lifted him from the floor, then he\nwiped his glasses, gathered up his books with a big, deep breath of\nrelief, and went into his room.  If the others had looked to see why he\nwas gone so long, they would have seen him on his knees beside his bed\nthanking God, as usual.  Leon couldn't have come closer than when he\nsaid, \"The same yesterday, to-day, and forever,\" about father.\n\nLeon had his arms around the neck of his horse now, and he was kissing\nher, patting her, and explaining to Shelley just why no other horse was\nlike her.  He was pouring out a jumble all about the oasis of the\ndesert, the tent dwellers, quoting lines from \"The Arab to His Horse,\"\nbluegrass, and gentleness combined with spirit, while Shelley had its\nhead between her hands, stroking it and saying, \"Yes,\" to every word\nLeon told her.  Then he said: \"Just hop on her back from that top step\nand ride her to the barn, if you want to see the motion she has.\"\n\nShelley said:  \"Has a woman ever been on her back?  Won't she shy at my\nskirts?\"\n\n\"No,\" explained Leon.  \"I've been training her with a horse blanket\npinned around me, so Susie could ride her!  She'll be all right.\"\n\nSo Shelley mounted, and the horse turned her head, and tried to rub\nagainst her, as she walked away, tame as a sheep.  I wondered if she\ncould be too gentle.  If she went \"like the wind,\" as Leon said, it\ndidn't show then.  I was almost crazy to go along, and maybe Leon would\nlet me ride a little while; but I had a question that it would help me\nto know the answer and I wanted to ask father before I forgot; so I\nwaited until he came out.  When he sat down, smiled at me and said,\n\"Well, is the girl happy for brother?\"  I knew it was a good time, and\nI could ask anything I chose, so I sat on his knee and said:  \"Father,\nwhen you pray for anything that it's all perfectly right for you to\nhave, does God come down from heaven and do it Himself, or does He send\na man like Laddie to do it for him?\"\n\nFather hugged me tight, smiling the happiest.\n\n\"Why, you have the whole thing right there in a nutshell, Little\nSister,\" he said.  \"You see it's like this: the Book tells us most\ndistinctly that 'God is love.'  Now it was love that sent Laddie to\nbind himself for a long, tedious job, to give Leon his horse, wasn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" I said.  \"He wouldn't have been likely to do it if he\nhated him.  It was love, of course!\"\n\n\"Then it was God,\" said father, \"because 'God is love.'  They are one\nand the same thing.\"\n\nThen he kissed me, and THAT was settled.  So I wondered when you longed\nfor anything so hard you really felt it was worth bothering God about,\nwhether the quickest way to get it was to ask Him for it, or to try to\nput a lot of love into the heart of some person who could do what you\nwanted.  I decided it all went back to God though, for most of the time\nprobably we wouldn't know who the right one was to try to awaken love\nin.  I was mighty sure none of us ever dreamed Laddie could walk over\nto Pryors', and come back with that horse, in a way perfectly\nsatisfactory to every one, slick as an eel.\n\nYou should have seen Leon following around after Laddie, trying to do\nthings for him, taking on his work to give him more time with the\nhorses, getting up early to finish his own stunts, so he could go over\nto Pryors' and help.  Mother said it had done more to make a man of him\nthan anything that ever happened.  It helped Shelley, too.  Something\nseemed to break in her, when she cried so with Leon, because he was in\ntrouble.  Then he was so crazy to show off his horse he had Shelley\nride up and down the lane, while he ran along and led, so she got a lot\nof exercise, and it made her good and hungry.  If you don't think by\nthis time that my mother was the beatenest woman alive, I'll prove it\nto you.  When the supper bell rang there was strawberry preserves\ninstead of the apple butter, biscuit, fried chicken, and mashed\npotatoes.\n\nShe must have slapped those chickens into the skillet before they knew\ntheir heads were off.  When Shelley came to the table, for the first\ntime since she'd been home, had pink in her cheeks, and talked some,\nand ate too, mother forgot her own supper.  She fumbled over her plate,\nbut scarcely touched even the livers, and those delicious little\nkidneys in the tailpiece like Leon and I had at Sally's wedding.  When\nwe finished, and it was time for her to give the signal to arise, no\none had asked to be excused, she said:  \"Let us have a word with the\nMost High.\"  Then she bowed her head, so all of us did too.  \"O Lord,\nwe praise Thee for all Thy tender mercies, and all Thy loving kindness.\nAmen!\"\n\nOf course father always asked the blessing to begin with, and mostly it\nwas the same one, and that was all at meal time, but this was a little\nextra that mother couldn't even wait until night to tell the Almighty,\nshe was so pleased with Him.  Maybe I haven't told everything about\nher, after all.  Father must have thought that was lovely of her; he\nsurely felt as happy as she did, to see Shelley better, for he hugged\nand kissed her over and over, finishing at her neck like he always did,\nand then I be hanged, if he didn't hug and kiss every last one of\nus--tight, even the boys.  Shelley he held long and close, and patted\nher a little when he let her go.  It made me wonder if the rest of us\ndidn't get ours, so he'd have a chance at her without her noticing it.\nOne thing was perfectly clear.  If shame came to us, they were going to\nlove her, and stick tight to her right straight through it.\n\nNow that everything was cleared up so, Shelley seemed a little more\nlike herself every day, although it was bad enough yet; I thought I\nmight as well hurry up the end a little, and stop the trouble\ncompletely, so I began watching for a chance to ask her.  But I wanted\nto get her away off alone, so no one would see if she slapped me.  I\ndidn't know how long I'd have to wait.  I tried coaxing her to the\norchard to see a bluebird's nest, but she asked if bluebirds were\nbuilding any different that year, and I had to admit they were not.\nThen I tried the blue-eyed Mary bed, but she said she supposed it was\nstill under the cling peach tree, and the flower, two white petals up,\ntwo blue down, and so it was.  Just as I was beginning to think I'd\nhave to take that to the Lord in prayer, I got my chance by accident.\n\nMay and Candace were forever going snake hunting.  You would think any\none with common sense would leave them alone and be glad of the chance,\nbut no indeed!  They went nearly every day as soon as the noon work was\nfinished, and stayed until time to get supper.  They did have heaps of\nfun and wild excitement.  May was gentle, and tender with everything\nelse on earth; so I 'spose she had a right to bruise the serpent with\nher heel--really she used sticks and stones--if she wanted to.  I asked\nher how she COULD, and she said there was a place in the Bible that\ntold how a snake coaxed Eve to eat an apple, that the Lord had told her\nshe mustn't touch; and so she got us into most of the trouble there was\nin the world.  May said it was all the fault of the SNAKE to begin\nwith, and she meant to pay up every one she could find, because she had\nnone of the apple, and lots of the trouble.  Candace cried so much\nbecause Frederick Swartz had been laid in the tomb, that mother was\npleased to have her cheer up, even enough to go snake hunting.\n\nThat afternoon Mehitabel Heasty had come to visit May, so she went\nalong, and I followed.  They poked around the driftwood at the\nfloodgate behind the barn, and were giving up the place.  Candace had\ncrossed the creek and was coming back, and May had started, when she\nsaw a tiny little one and chased it.  We didn't know then that it was a\ngood thing to have snakes to eat moles, field mice, and other pests\nthat bother your crops; the Bible had no mercy on them at all, so we\nwere not saving our snakes; and anyway we had more than we needed,\nwhile some of them were too big to be safe to keep, and a few poison as\ncould be.  May began to bruise the serpent, when out of the driftwood\nwhere they hadn't found anything came its mammy, a great big\nblacksnake, maddest you ever saw, with its pappy right after her, mad\nas ever too.  Candace screamed at May to look behind her, but May was\nbusy with the snake and didn't look quick enough, so the old mammy\nstruck right in her back.  She just caught in the hem of May's skirt,\nand her teeth stuck in the goods--you know how a snake's teeth turn\nback--so she couldn't let go.  May took one look and raced down the\nbank to the crossing, through the water, and toward us, with the snake\ndragging and twisting, and trying her best to get away.  May was\nscreaming at every jump for Candace, and Mehitabel was flying up and\ndown crying:  \"Oh there's snakes in my shoes!  There's snakes in my\nshoes!\"\n\nThat was a fair sample of how much sense a Heasty ever had.  It took\nall Mehitabel's shoes could do to hold her feet, for after one went\nbarefoot all week, and never put on shoes except on Sunday or for a\nvisit, the feet became so spread out, shoes had all they could do to\nmanage them, and then mostly they pinched until they made one squirm.\nBut she jumped and said that, while May ran and screamed, and Candace\ngripped her big hickory stick and told May to stand still.  Then she\nbruised that serpent with her whole foot, for she stood on it, and\nswatted it until she broke its neck.  Then she turned ready for the\nother one, but when it saw what happened to its mate, it decided to go\nback.  Even snakes, it doesn't seem right to break up families like\nthat; so by the time Candace got the mammy killed, loose from May's\nhem, and stretched out with the back up, so she wouldn't make it rain,\nwhen Candace wasn't sure that father wanted rain, I had enough.  I went\ndown the creek until I was below the orchard, then I crossed, passed\nthe cowslip bed, climbed the hill and fence, and stopped to think what\nI would do first; and there only a few feet away was Shelley.  She was\nsitting in the shade, her knees drawn up, her hands clasped around\nthem, staring straight before her across the meadow at nothing in\nparticular, that I could see.  She jumped as if I had been a snake when\nshe saw me, then she said, \"Oh, is it you?\" like she was half glad of\nit.  My chance had come.\n\nI went to her, sat close beside her and tried snuggling up a little.\nIt worked.  She put her arm around me, drew me tight, rubbed her cheek\nagainst my head and we sat there.  I was wondering how in the world I\ncould ask her, and not get slapped.  I was growing most too big for\nthat slapping business, anyway.  We sat there; I was looking across the\nmeadow as she did, only I was watching everything that went on, so when\nI saw a grosbeak fly from the wild grape where Shelley had put the\ncrock for sap, it made me think of her hair.  She used to like to have\nme play with it so well, she'd give me pennies if I did.  I got up, and\nbegan pulling out her pins carefully.  I knew I was getting a start\nbecause right away she put up her hand to help me.\n\n\"I can get them,\" I said just as flannel-mouthed as ever I could, like\nall of us talked to her now, so I got every one and never pulled a\nmite.  When I reached over her shoulder to drop them in her lap, being\nso close I kissed her cheek.  Then I shook down her hair, spread it\nout, lifted it, parted it, and held up strands to let the air on her\nscalp.  She shivered and said: \"Mercy child, how good that does feel!\nMy head has ached lately until it's a wonder there's a hair left on it.\"\n\nSo I was pleasing her.  I never did handle hair so carefully.  I tried\nevery single thing it feels good to you to have done with your hair,\nrubbed her head gently, and to cheer her up I told her about May and\nthe snake, and what fool Mehitabel had said, and she couldn't help\nlaughing; so I had her feeling about as good as she could, for the way\nshe actually felt, but still I didn't really get ahead.  Come right to\nthe place to do it, that was no very easy question to ask a person,\nwhen you wouldn't hurt their feelings for anything; I was beginning to\nwonder if I would lose my chance, when all at once a way I could manage\npopped into my mind.\n\n\"Shelley,\" I said, \"they told you about Laddie and the Princess, didn't\nthey?\"\n\nI knew they had, but I had to make a beginning some way.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.  \"I'm glad of it!  I think she's pretty as a picture,\nand nice as she looks.  Laddie may have to hump himself to support her,\nbut if he can't get her as fine clothes as she has, her folks can help\nhim.  They seem to have plenty, and she's their only child.\"\n\n\"They're going to.  I heard Mr. Pryor ask Laddie if he'd be so unkind\nas to object to them having the pleasure of giving her things.\"\n\n\"Well, the greenhorn didn't say he would!\"\n\n\"No.  He didn't want to put his nose to the grindstone quite that\nclose.  He said it was between them.\"\n\n\"I should think so!\"\n\n\"Shelley, there's a question I've been wanting to ask some one for\nquite a while.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why, this!  You know, Laddie was in love with the Princess, like you\nare when you want to marry folks, for a long, long time, before he\ncould be sure whether she loved him back.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, now, 'spose she never had loved him, would he have had anything\nto be ashamed of?\"\n\n\"I can't see that he would.  Some one must start a courtship, or there\nwould be no marrying, and it's conceded to be the place of the man.\nNo.  He might be disappointed, or dreadfully hurt, but there would be\nno shame about it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, suppose she loved him, and wanted to marry him, and he\nhadn't loved her, or wanted her, would SHE have had anything to be\nashamed of?\"\n\n\"I don't think so!  If she was attracted by him, and thought she would\nlike him, she would have a right to go to a certain extent, to find out\nif he cared for her, and if he didn't, why, she'd just have to give him\nup.  But any sensible girl waits for a man to make the advances, and\nplenty of them, before she allows herself even to dream of loving him,\nor at least, I would.\"\n\nNow I was getting somewhere!\n\n\"Of course you would!\" I said.  \"That would be the WAY mother would,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Surely!\"\n\n\"If that Paget man you used to write about had seemed to be just what\nyou liked, you'd have waited to know if he wanted you, before you loved\nhim, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"I certainly would!\" answered Shelley.  \"Or at least, I'd have waited\nuntil I THOUGHT sure as death, I knew.  It seems that sometimes you can\nbe fooled about those things.\"\n\n\"But if you thought sure you knew, and then found out you had been\nmistaken, you wouldn't have anything to be ASHAMED of, would you?\"\n\n\"Not-on-your-life-I-wouldn't!\" cried Shelley, hammering each word into\nher right knee with her doubled fist.  \"What are you driving at,\nBlatherskite?  What have you got into your head?\"\n\n\"Oh just studying about things,\" I said, which was exactly the truth.\n\"Sally getting married last fall, and Laddie going to this, just\nstarted me to wondering.\"\n\nFooled her, too!\n\n\"Oh well, there's no harm done,\" she said.  \"The sooner you get these\nmatters straightened out, the better able you will be to take care of\nyourself.  If you ever go to a city, you'll find out that a girl needs\nconsiderable care taken of her.\"\n\n\"You could look out for yourself, Shelley?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know as I made such a glorious fist of it,\" she said,\n\"but at least, as you say, I've nothing to be ashamed of!\"\n\nI almost hugged her head off.\n\n\"Of course you haven't!\" I cried.  \"Of course you wouldn't have!\"\n\nI just kissed her over and over for joy; I was so glad my heart hurt\nfor father and mother.  Shame had not come to them!\n\n\"Now, I guess I'll run to the house and get a comb,\" I told her.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Shelley.  \"I know you are tired.\"\n\n\"I'm not in the least,\" I said.  \"Don't you remember I always use a\ncomb when I fuss with your hair?\"\n\n\"It is better,\" said Shelley.  \"Go get one.\"\n\nAs I got up to start I took a last look at her, and there was something\nin her face that I couldn't bear.  I knelt beside her, and put both\narms around her neck.\n\n\"Shelley, it's a secret,\" I said in a breathless half whisper.  \"It's a\ngreat, big secret, but I'm going to tell you.  Twice now I've had a\npowerful prayer all ready to try.  It's the kind where you go to the\nbarn, all alone, stand on that top beam below the highest window and\nlook toward the east.  You keep perfectly still, and just think with\nall your might, and you look away over where Jesus used to be, and when\nthe right feeling comes, you pray that prayer as if He stood before\nyou, and it will come true.  I KNOW it will come true.  The reason I\nknow is because twice now I've been almost ready to try it, and what I\nintended to ask for happened before I had time; so I've saved that\nprayer; but Shelley, shall I pray it about the Paget man, for you?\"\n\nShe gripped me, and she shook until she was all twisted up; you could\nhear her teeth click, she chilled so.  The tears just gushed, and she\npulled me up close and whispered right in my ear:\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nIt was only pretend about the comb; what I really wanted was to get to\nfather and mother quick.  I knew he was at the barn and he was going to\nbe too happy for words in a minute.  But as I went up the lane, I\nwasn't sure whether I'd rather pray about that Paget man or bruise him\nwith my heel like a serpent.  The only way I could fix it was to\nremember if Shelley loved him so, he must be mighty nice.  Father was\nin the wagon shovelling corn from it to a platform where it would be\nhandy to feed the pigs, so I ran and called him, and put one foot on a\nhub and raised my hands.  He pulled me up and when he saw how important\nit was, he sat on the edge of the bed, so I told him:  \"Father, you\nhaven't got a thing in the world to be ashamed of about Shelley.\"\n\n\"Praise the Lord!\" said father like I knew he would, but you should\nhave seen his face.  \"Tell me about it!\"\n\nI told him and he said:  \"Well, I don't know but this is the gladdest\nhour of my life.  Go straight and repeat to your mother exactly what\nyou've said to me.  Take her away all alone, and then forget about it,\nyou little blessing.\"\n\n\"Father, have you got too many children?\"\n\n\"No!\" he said.  \"I wish I had a dozen more, if they'd be like you.\"\n\nWhen I went up the lane I was so puffed up with importance I felt too\ndignified to run.  I strutted like our biggest turkey gobbler.  The\nonly reason you couldn't hear my wings scrape, was because through\nmistake they grew on the turkey.  If I'd had them, I would have dragged\nthem sure, and cried \"Ge-hobble-hobble!\" at every step.\n\nI took mother away alone and told her, and she asked many more\nquestions than father, but she was even gladder than he.  She almost\nhugged the breath out of me.  Sometimes I get things RIGHT, anyway!\nThen I took the comb and ran back to Shelley.\n\n\"I thought you'd forgotten me,\" she said.\n\nShe had wiped up and was looking better.  If ever I combed carefully I\ndid then.  Just when I had all the tangles out, there came mother.  She\nhad not walked that far in a long time.  I thought maybe she could\ncomfort Shelley, so I laid the comb in her lap and went to see how the\nsnake hunters were coming on.  It must be all right, when the Bible\nsays so, but the African Jungle will do for me, and a popgun is not\ngoing to scatter families.  I never felt so strongly about breaking\nhome ties in my life as I did then.  There was nothing worse.  It was\nnot where I wanted to be, so I thought I'd go back to the barn, and\nhang around father, hoping maybe he'd brag on me some more.  Going up\nthe lane I saw a wagon passing with the biggest box I ever had seen,\nand I ran to the gate to watch where it went.  It stopped at our house\nand Frank came toward me as I hurried up the road.\n\n\"Where are the folks?\" he asked, without paying the least attention to\nmy asking him over and over what was in the box.\n\n\"May and Candace are killing every snake in the driftwood behind the\nbarn, Shelley and mother are down in the orchard, and father and the\nboys are hauling corn.\"\n\n\"Go tell the boys to come quickly and keep quiet,\" he said.  \"But don't\nlet any one else know I'm here.\"\n\nThat was so exciting I almost fell over my feet running, and all three\nof them came quite as fast.  I stood back and watched, and I just\ndanced a steady hop from one foot to the other while those men got the\nbig box off the wagon and opened it.  On the side I spelled Piano, so\nof course it was for Shelley.  It was so heavy it took all six of them,\nfather and the three boys, the driver and another very stylish looking\nman to carry it.  They put it in the parlour, screwed a leg on each\ncorner, and a queer harp in the middle, then they lifted it up and set\nit on its feet, under the whatnot, and it seemed as if it filled half\nthe room.  Then Frank spread a beauteous wine coloured cover all\nembroidered in pink roses with green leaves over it, and the stylish\nman opened a lid, sat down and spread out his hands.  Frank said:\n\"Soft pedal!  Mighty soft!\"  So he smothered it down, and tried only\nenough to find that it had not been hurt coming, and then he went away\non the wagon.  Father and the boys gathered up every scrap, swept the\nwalk, and put all the things they had used back where they got them,\nlike we always did.\n\nThen Frank took a card from his pocket and tied it to the music rack,\nand it read:  \"For Shelley, from her brothers in fact, and in law.\"  To\na corner of the cover he pinned another card that read:  \"From Peter.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked father.\n\n\"That's from Peter,\" said Frank.  \"Peter is great on finishing touches.\nHe had to outdo the rest of us that much or bust.  Fact is, none of us\nthought of a cover except him.\"\n\n\"How about this?\" asked father, staring at it as if it were an animal\nthat would bite.\n\n\"Well,\" said Frank, \"it was apparent that practising her fingers to the\nbone wouldn't do Shelley much good unless she could keep it up in\nsummer, and you and mother always have done so much for the rest of us,\nand now mother isn't so strong and the expenses go on the same with\nthese youngsters; we know you were figuring on it, but we beat you.\nPut yours in the bank, and try the feel of a surplus once more.\nHaven't had much lately, have you, father?\"\n\n\"Well, not to speak of,\" said father.\n\n\"Now let's shut everything up, ring the bell to call them, and get\nShelley in here and surprise her.\"\n\n\"She's not very well,\" said father.  \"Mother thinks she worked too\nhard.\"\n\n\"She's all right now, father,\" I said.  \"She is getting pink again and\nrounder, and this will fix her grand.\"\n\nWouldn't it though!  There wasn't one anywhere, short of the city.\nEven the Princess had none.  Father hunted up a song book, opened it\nand set it on the rack.  Then all of us went out.\n\n\"We'll write to the boys, mother and I, and Shelley also,\" said father.\n\"I can't express myself just now.  This is a fine thing for all of you\nto do.\"\n\nFrank seemed to think so too, and looked rather puffed up, until Leon\nbegan telling about his horse.  When Frank found out that Laddie, who\nhad not yet branched out for himself, had given Leon much more than any\none of them had Shelley, he looked a little disappointed.  He explained\nhow the piano cost eight hundred dollars, but by paying cash all at\nonce, the man took seven hundred and fifty, so it only cost them one\nhundred and fifty a piece, and none of them felt it at all.\n\n\"Sometimes the clouds loom up pretty black, and mother and I scarcely\nknow how to go on, save for the help of the Lord, but we certainly are\nblest with good children, children we can be proud of.  Your mother\nwill like that instrument as well as Shelley, son,\" said father.\n\nFrank went out and rang the bell, tolled it, and made a big noise like\nhe always did when he came unexpectedly, and then sat on the back fence\nuntil he saw them coming, and went to meet them.  He walked between\nmother and Shelley, with an arm around each one.  If he thought Shelley\nlooked badly, he didn't mention it.  What he did say was that he was\nstarved, and to fly around and get supper.  I thought I'd burst.  They\nbegan to cook, and the boys went to feed and see Leon's horse, and then\nwe had supper.  I just sat and stared at Frank and grinned.  I couldn't\neat.\n\n\"Do finish your supper,\" said mother.  \"I never saw anything take your\nappetite like seeing your brother.  You'll be wanting a piece before\nbedtime.\"\n\nI didn't say a word, because I was afraid to, but I kept looking at\nLeon and he smiled back, and we had great fun.  Secrets are lovely.\nMother couldn't have eaten a bite if she'd known about that great\nshining thing, all full of wonderful sound, standing in our parlour.\nWhen the last slow person had finished, father said:  \"Shelley, won't\nyou step into the front room and bring me that book I borrowed from\nFrank on 'Taxation.' I want to talk over a few points.\"\n\nAll of us heard her little breathless cry, and mother said, \"There!\" as\nif she'd been listening for something, and she beat all of us to the\ndoor.  Then she cried out too, and such a time as we did have.  At last\nafter all of us had grown sensible enough to behave, Shelley sat on the\nstool, spread her fingers over the keys and played at the place father\nhad selected, and all of us sang as hard as we could:  \"Be it ever so\nhumble, There's no place like home;\" and there WAS no place like ours,\nof THAT I'm quite sure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nIn Faith Believing\n\n  \"Nor could the bright green world around\n     A joy to her impart,\n  For still she missed the eyes that made\n     The summer of her heart.\"\n\n\nSoon as she had the piano, Shelley needed only the Paget man to make\nher happy as a girl could be; and having faith in that prayer, I\ndecided to try it right away.  So I got Laddie to promise surely that\nhe'd wake me when he got up the next morning.\n\nI laid my clothes out all ready; he merely touched my foot, and I came\nto, slipped out with him, and he helped me dress.  We went to the barn\nwhen the morning was all gray.\n\n\"What the dickens have you got in your head now, Chicken?\" he asked.\n\"Is it business with the Fairies?\"\n\n\"No, this is with the Most High,\" I said solemnly, like father.  \"Go\naway and leave me alone.\"\n\n\"Well of all the queer chickens!\" he said, but he kissed me and went.\n\nI climbed the stairs to the threshing floor, then the ladder to the\nmow, walked a beam to the wall, there followed one to the east end, and\nanother to the little, high-up ventilator window.  There I stood\nlooking at the top of the world.  A gray mist was rising like steam\nfrom the earth, there was a curious colour in the east, stripes of\norange and flames of red, where the sun was coming.  I folded my hands\non the sill, faced the sky, and stood staring.  Just stood, and stood,\nnever moving a muscle.  By and by I began to think how much we loved\nShelley, how happy she had been at Christmas the way she was now, and\nhow much all of us would give in money, or time, or love, to make her\nsparkling, bubbling, happy again; so I thought and thought, gazing at\nthe sky, which every second became a grander sight.  Little cold chills\nbegan going up my back, and soon I was talking to the Lord exactly as\nif He stood before me on the reddest ray that topped our apple trees.\n\nI don't know all I said.  That's funny, for I usually remember to the\nlast word; but this time it was so important, I wanted it so badly, and\nI was so in earnest that words poured in a stream.  I began by\nreminding Him that He knew everything, and so He'd understand if what I\nasked was for the best.  Then I told Him how it looked to us, who knew\nonly a part; and then I went at Him and implored and beseeched, if it\nwould be best for Shelley, and would make her happy, to send her the\nPaget man, and to be quick about it.  When I had said the last word\nthat came to me, and begged all I thought becoming--I don't think with\nHis face, that Jesus wants us to grovel to Him, at least He looks too\ndignified to do it Himself--I just stood there, still staring.\n\nI didn't expect to see a burning bush, or a pillar of fire, or a cloud\nof flame, or even to hear a small, still voice; but I watched, so I\nwouldn't miss it if there should be anything different in that sunrise\nfrom any other I ever had seen, and there was not.  Not one thing!  It\nwas so beautiful, and I was so in earnest my heart hurt; but that was\nlike any other sunrise on a fine July morning.  There wasn't the least\nsign that Jesus had heard me, and would send the man; yet before I knew\nit, I was amazed to find the feeling creeping over me that he was\ncoming.  If I had held the letter in my hand saying he would arrive on\nthe noon train, I couldn't have grown surer.  Why, I even looked down\nthe first time I moved, to see if I had it; but I was certain anyway.\nSo I looked steadily toward the east once more and said, \"Thank you,\nwith all my heart, Lord Jesus,\" then I slowly made my way down and back\nto the house.\n\nShelley was at the orchard gate, waiting; so I knew they had missed me,\nand Laddie had told them where I was and not to call.  She had the\nstrangest look on her face, as she asked:  \"Where have you been?\"\n\nI looked straight and hard at her and said, \"It's all right, Shelley.\nHe's going to come soon\"; but I didn't think it was a thing to mouth\nover, so I twisted away from her, and ran to the kitchen to see if\nbreakfast had all been eaten.  I left Shelley standing there with her\neyes wide, also her mouth.  She looked about as intelligent as\nMehitabel Heasty, and it wouldn't have surprised me if she had begun to\njump up and down and say there were snakes in HER shoes.  No doubt you\nhave heard of people having been knocked silly; I knew she was, and so\nshe had a perfect right to look that way, until she could remember what\nshe was doing, and come back to herself.  Maybe it took her longer,\nbecause mother wasn't there, to remind her about her mouth, and I\ndidn't propose to mention it.\n\nAt breakfast, mother said father was going to drive Frank home in the\ncarriage, and if I would like, I might go along.  I would have to sit\non the back seat alone, going; but coming home I could ride beside and\nvisit with father.  I loved that, for you could see more from the front\nseat, and father would stop to explain every single thing.  He always\ngave me the money and let me pay the toll.  He would get me a drink at\nthe spring, let me wade a few minutes at Enyard's riffles, where their\ncreek, with the loveliest gravel bed, ran beside the road; and he\nalways raced like wildfire at the narrows, where for a mile the\nrailroad ran along the turnpike.\n\nWe took Frank to his office, stopped a little while to visit Lucy, and\ngive her the butter and cream mother sent, went to the store to see\nPeter, and then to the post-office.  From there we could see that the\nveranda of the hotel across the street was filled with gayly dressed\npeople, and father said that the summer boarders from big cities around\nmust be pouring in fast.  When he came out with the mail he said he\nbetter ask if the landlord did not want some of mother's corn and milk\nfed spring chickens, because last year he had paid her more than the\ngrocer.  So he drove across the street, stopped at the curb, and left\nme to hold the team.\n\nMaybe you think I wasn't proud!  I've told you about Ned and Jo, with\ntheir sharp ears, dappled sides, and silky tails, and the carriage\nalmost new, with leather seats, patent leather trimmings, and side\nlamps, so shiny you could see yourself in the brass.  We never drove\ninto the barn with one speck of mud or dust on it.  That was how\nparticular mother was.\n\nI watched the team carefully; I had to if I didn't want my neck broken;\nbut I also kept an eye on that veranda.  You could see at a glance that\nthose were stylish women.  Now my mother liked to be in fashion as well\nas any one could; so I knew she'd be mightily pleased if I could tell\nher a new place to set her comb, a different way to fasten her collar,\nor about an unusual pattern for a frock.\n\nI got my drink at the spring, father offered to stop at the riffle, but\nI was enjoying the ride so much, and I could always wade at home,\nalthough our creek was not so beautiful as Enyard's, but for common\nwading it would do; we went through the narrows, like two shakes of a\nsheep's tail, then we settled down to a slow trot, and were having the\nloveliest visit possible, when in the bundle on my lap, I saw the end\nof something that interested me.  Mr. Agnew always made our mail into a\nroll with the Advocate and the Agriculturist on the outside, and\nbecause every one was so anxious about their letters, and some of them\nmeant so much, I felt grown and important while holding the package.\n\nI was gripping it tight when I noticed the end of one letter much wider\nand fatter than any I ever had seen, so when father was not looking I\nbegan pushing it a little at one end, and pulling it at the other, to\nwork it up, until I could read the address.  I got it out so far I\nthought every minute he'd notice, and tell me not to do that, but I\ncould only see Stanton.  All of us were Stanton, so it might be for me,\nfor that matter.  Jerry might be sending me pictures, or a book, he did\nsometimes, but there was an exciting thing about it.  Besides being\nfatter than it looked right at the end, it was plastered with\nstamps--lots of them, enough to have brought it clear around the world.\nI pushed that end back, pulled out the other, and took one good look.\nI almost fell from the carriage.  I grabbed father's arm and cried:\n\"Stop!  Stop this team quick.  Stop them and see if I can read.\"\n\n\"Are you crazy, child?\" asked father, but he checked the horses.\n\n\"No, but you are going to be in a minute,\" I said.  \"Look at that!\"\n\nI yanked the letter from the bundle, and held it over.  I THOUGHT I\ncould read, but I was too scared to be sure.  I thought it said in big,\nstrong, upstanding letters, Miss Shelley Stanton, Groveville, Indiana.\nAnd in the upper corner, Blackburn, Yeats and PAGET, Counsellors of\nLaw, 37 to 39 State St., Chicago.  I put my finger on the Paget, and\nlooked into father's face.  I was no fool after all.  He was not a bit\nsurer that HE could read than I was, from the dazed way he stared.\n\n\"You see!\" I said.\n\n\"It says Paget!\" he said, like he would come nearer believing; it if he\nheard himself pronounce the word.\n\n\"I THOUGHT it said 'Paget,'\" I gasped, \"but I wanted to know if you\nthought so too.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's Paget plain enough,\" said father, but he acted like there\nwas every possibility that it might change to Jones any minute.  \"It\nsays 'Paget,' plain as print.\"\n\n\"Father!\" I cried, clutching his arm, \"father, see how fat it is!\nThere must be pages and pages!  Father, it wouldn't take all that to\ntell her he didn't like her, and he never wanted to see her again.\nWould it, father?\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem probable,\" said father.\n\n\"Father don't you think it means there's been some big mistake, and it\ntakes so much to tell how it can be fixed?\"\n\n\"It seems reasonable.\"\n\nI gripped him tighter, and maybe shook him a little.\n\n\"Father!\" I cried.  \"Father, doesn't it just look HURRY, all over?\nCan't you speed up a little?  They have all day to cool off.  Oh\nfather, won't you speed a little?\"\n\n\"That I will!\" said father.  \"Get a tight hold, and pray God it is good\nword we carry.\"\n\n\"But I prayed the one big prayer to get this,\" I said.  \"It wouldn't be\nsent if it wasn't good.  The thing to do now is to thank the Lord for\n'all his loving kindnesses,' like mother said.\"\n\n\"Drive father!  Make them go!\"\n\nAt first he only touched them up; I couldn't see that we were getting\nhome so fast; but in a minute a cornfield passed like a streak, a piece\nof woods flew by a dark blur, a bridge never had time to rattle, and we\nbegan to rock from side to side a little.  Then I gripped the top\nsupports with one hand, the mail with the other, and hung on for dear\nlife.  I took one good look at father.\n\nHis feet were on the brace, his face was clear, even white, his eyes\nsteely, and he never moved a muscle.  When Jo thought it was funny,\nthat he was loose in the pasture, and kicked up a little behind, father\ngave him a sharp cut with the whip and said: \"Steady boy!  Get along\nthere!\"\n\nSometimes he said, \"Aye, aye!  Easy!\" but he never stopped a mite.  We\nwhizzed past the church and cemetery, and scarcely touched the Big\nHill.  People ran to their doors, even to the yards, and I was sure\nthey thought we were having a runaway, but we were not.  Father began\nto stop at the lane gate, he pulled all the way past the garden, and it\nwas as much as he could do to get them slowed down so that I could jump\nout by the time we reached the hitching rack.  He tied them, and\nfollowed me into the house instead of going to the barn.  I ran ahead\ncalling: \"Shelley!  Where is Shelley?\"\n\n\"What in this world has happened, child?\" asked mother, catching my arm.\n\n\"Her letter has come!  Her Paget letter!  The one you looked for until\nyou gave up.  It's come at last!  Oh, where is she?\"\n\n\"Be calmer, child, you'll frighten her,\" said mother.\n\nMay snatched the letter from my fingers and began to read all that was\non it aloud.  I burst out crying.\n\n\"Make her give that back!\" I sobbed to father.  \"It's mine!  I found\nit.  Father, make her let me take it!\"\n\n\"Give it to her!\" said father.  \"I rather feel that it is her right to\ndeliver it.\"\n\nMay passed it back, but she looked so disappointed, that by how she\nfelt I knew how much I wanted to take it myself; so I reached my hand\nto her and said:  \"You can come along!  We'll both take it!  Oh where\nis she?\"\n\n\"She went down in the orchard,\" said mother.  \"I think probably she's\ngone back where she was the other day.\"\n\nGee, but we ran!  And there she was!  As we came up, she heard us and\nturned.\n\n\"Shelley!\" I cried.  \"Here's your letter!  Everything is all right!\nHe's coming, Shelley!  Look quick, and see when!  Mother will want to\nbegin baking right away!\"\n\nShelley looked at me, and said coolly:  \"Paddy Ryan!  What's the\nmatter?\"\n\n\"Your letter!\" I cried, shoving it right against her hands.  \"Your\nletter from Robert!  From the Paget man, you know!  I told you he was\ncoming!  Hurry, and see when!\"\n\nShe took it, and sat there staring at it, so much like father, that it\nmade me think of him, so I saw that she was going to have to come\naround to it as we did, and that one couldn't hurry her.  She just had\nto take her time to sense it.\n\n\"Shall I open it for you?\" I asked, merely to make her see that it was\ntime she was doing it herself.\n\nBlest if she didn't reach it toward me!--sort of woodenlike.  I stuck\nmy finger under the flap, gave it a rip across and emptied what was\ninside into her lap.  Bet there were six or seven letters in queer\nyellow envelopes I never before had seen any like, and on them was the\nname, Robert Paget, while in one corner it said, \"Returned Dead\nLetter\"; also there was a loose folded white sheet.  She sat staring at\nthe heap, touching one, another, and repeating \"Robert Paget?\" as she\npicked each up in turn.\n\n\"What do you suppose it means?\" she asked May.  May examined them.\n\n\"You must read the loose sheet,\" she advised.  \"No doubt that will\nexplain.\"\n\nBut Shelley never touched it.  She handled those letters and stared at\nthem.  Father and mother came through the orchard and stood together\nbehind us, so father knelt down at last, reached across Shelley's\nshoulder, picked one up and looked at it.\n\n\"Have you good word, dear?\" asked mother of Shelley.\n\n\"Why, I don't understand at all,\" said Shelley.  \"Just look at all\nthese queer letters, addressed to Mr. Paget.  Why should they be sent\nto me?  I mustn't open them.  They're not mine.  There must be some\nmistake.\"\n\n\"These are DEAD LETTERS,\" said father.  \"They've been written to you,\ncouldn't be delivered, and so were sent to the Dead Letter Office at\nWashington, which returned them to the writer, and unopened he has\nforwarded them once more to you.  You've heard of dead letters, haven't\nyou?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Shelley.  \"I don't remember just now; but there\ncouldn't be a better name.  They've come mighty near killing me.\"\n\n\"If you'd only read that note!\" urged May, putting it right into her\nfingers.\n\nShelley still sat there.\n\n\"I'm afraid of it,\" she said exactly like I'd have spoken if there had\nbeen a big rattlesnake coming right at me, when I'd nothing at hand to\nbruise it.\n\nLaddie and Leon came from the barn.  They had heard me calling, seen\nMay and me run, and then father and mother coming down, so they walked\nover.\n\n\"What's up?\" asked Leon.  \"Has Uncle Levi's will been discovered, and\ndoes mother get his Mexican mines?\"\n\n\"What have you got, Shelley?\" asked Laddie, kneeling beside her, and\npicking up one of the yellow letters.\n\n\"I hardly know,\" said Shelley.\n\n\"I brought her a big letter with all those little ones and a note in\nit, and they are from the Paget man,\" I explained to him.  \"But she\nwon't even read the note, and see what he writes.  She says she's\nafraid.\"\n\n\"Poor child!  No wonder!\" said Laddie, sitting beside her and putting\nhis arm around her.  \"Suppose I read it for you.  May I?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Shelley.  \"You read it.  Read it out loud.  I don't care.\"\n\nShe leaned against him, while he unfolded the white sheet.\n\n\"Umph!\" he said.  \"This DOES look bad for you.  It begins:  'My own\ndarling Girl.'\"\n\n\"Let me see!\" cried Shelley, suddenly straightening, and reaching her\nhand.\n\nLaddie held the page toward her, but she only looked, she didn't offer\nto touch it.\n\n\"'My own darling Girl:'\" repeated Laddie tenderly, making it mean just\nall he possibly could, because he felt so dreadfully sorry for\nher--\"'On my return to Chicago, from the trip to England I have so\noften told you I intended to make some time soon----'\"\n\n\"Did he?\" asked mother.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Shelley.  \"He couldn't talk about much else.  It was\nhis first case.  It was for a friend of his who had been robbed of\neverything in the world; honour, relatives, home, and money.  If Robert\nwon it, he got all that back for his friend and enough for\nhimself--that he could--a home of his own, you know!  Read on, Laddie!\"\n\n\"'I was horrified to find on my desk every letter I had written you\nduring my absence returned to me from the Dead Letter Office, as you\nsee.'\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" cried mother, picking up one and clutching it tight as\nif she meant to see that it didn't get away again.\n\n\"Go on!\" cried Shelley.\n\n\"'I am enclosing some of them as they came back to me, in proof of my\nstatement.  I drove at once to your boarding place and found you had\nnot been there for weeks, and your landlady was distinctly crabbed.\nThen I went to the college, only to find that you had fallen ill and\ngone to your home.  That threw me into torments, and all that keeps me\nfrom taking the first train is the thought that perhaps you refused to\naccept these letters, for some reason.  Shelley, you did not, did you?\nThere is some mistake somewhere, is there not----'\"\n\n\"One would be led to think so,\" said father sternly.  \"Seems as if he\nmight have managed some way----\"\n\n\"Don't you blame him!\" cried Shelley.  \"Can't you see it's all my\nfault?  He'd been coming regularly, and the other girls envied me; then\nhe just disappeared, and there was no word or anything, and they\nlaughed and whispered until I couldn't endure it; so I moved in with\nPeter's cousin, as I wrote you; but that left Mrs. Fleet with an empty\nroom in the middle of the term, and it made her hopping mad.  I bet\nanything she wouldn't give the postman my new address, to pay me back.\nI left it, of course.  But if I'd been half a woman, and had the\nconfidence I should have had in myself and in him----  Oh how I've\nsuffered, and punished all of you----!\"\n\n\"Never you mind about that,\" said mother, stroking Shelley's hair.\n\"Likely there isn't much in Chicago to give a girl who never had been\naway from her family before, 'confidence' in herself or any one else.\nAs for him--just disappearing like that, without a word or even a\nline----  Go on Laddie!\"\n\n\"'Surely, you knew that I was only waiting the outcome of this trip to\ntell you how dearly I love you.  Surely, you encouraged me in thinking\nyou cared for me a little, Shelley.  Only a little will do to begin\nwith----'\"\n\n\"You see, I DID have something to go on!\" cried Shelley, wiping her\neyes and straightening up.\n\n\"'No doubt you misunderstood and resented my going without coming to\nexplain, and bid you good-bye in person, but Shelley, _I_ SIMPLY DARED\nNOT.  You see, it was this way:  I got a cable about the case I was\nalways talking of, and the only man who could give the testimony I MUST\nHAVE was dying!'\"\n\n\"For land's sake!  The poor boy!\" cried mother, patting Shelley's\nshoulder.\n\n\"'An hour's delay might mean the loss of everything in the world to me,\neven you.  For if I lost any time, and the man escaped me, there was no\nhope of winning my case, and everything, even you, as I said before,\ndepended on him----'\"\n\n\"Good Lord!  I mean land!\" cried Leon.\n\n\"'If I could catch the train in an hour, I could take a boat at New\nYork, and go straight through with no loss of time.  So I wrote you a\nnote that probably said more than I would have ventured in person, and\npaid a boy to deliver it.'\"\n\n\"Kept the money and tore up the note, I bet!\" said May.\n\n\"'I wrote on the train, but found after sailing that I had rushed so I\nhad failed to post it in New York.  I kept on writing every day on the\nboat, and mailed you six at Liverpool.  All the time I have written\nfrequently; there are many more here that this envelope will not hold,\nthat I shall save until I hear from you.'\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" said father.\n\n\"'Shelley, I beat death, reached my man, got the testimony I had to\nhave, and won my case.'\"\n\n\"Glory!\" cried mother.  \"Praise the Lord!\"\n\n\"'Then I scoured England, and part of the continent, hunting some\ninterested parties; and when I was so long finding them, and still no\nword came from you, I decided to come back and get you, if you would\ncome with me, and go on with the work together.'\"\n\n\"Listen to that!  More weddings!\" cried Leon.  He dropped on his knees\nbefore Shelley.  \"Will you marry me, my pretty maid?\" he begged.\n\n\"Young man, if you cut any capers right now, I'll cuff your ears!\"\ncried father.  \"This is no proper time for your foolishness!\"\n\n\"'Shelley, I beg that you will believe me, and if you care for me in\nthe very least, telegraph if I may come.  Quick!  I'm half insane to\nsee you.  I have many things to tell you, first of all how dear you are\nto me.  Please telegraph.  Robert.'\"\n\n\"Saddle a horse, Leon!\" father cried as he unstrapped his wallet.\n\n\"Laddie, take down her message.\"\n\n\"Can you put it into ten words?\" asked Laddie.\n\n\"Mother, what would you say?\" questioned Shelley.\n\nLeon held up his fingers and curled down one with each word.  \"Say,\n'Dear Robert.  Well and happy.  Come when you get ready.'\"\n\n\"But then I won't know when he's coming,\" objected Shelley.  \"You don't\nneed to,\" said Leon.  \"You can take it for granted from that epistolary\neffusion that he won't let the grass grow under his feet while coming\nhere.  That's a bully message!  It sounds as if you weren't crazy over\nhim, and it's a big compliment to mother.  Looks as if she didn't have\nto know when people are coming--like she's ready all the time.\"\n\n\"Write it out and let me see,\" said Shelley.\n\nSo Laddie wrote it, and she looked at it a long time, it seemed to me,\nat last she said:  \"I don't like that 'get.'  It doesn't sound right.\nWouldn't 'are' be better?\"\n\n\"Come when you are ready,\" repeated Laddie.  \"Yes, that's better.\n'Get' sounds rather saucy.\"\n\n\"Why not put it, 'Come when you choose?'\" suggested mother.  \"That will\nleave a word to spare, so it won't look as if you had counted them and\nused exactly ten on purpose, and it doesn't sound as if you expected\nhim to make long preparations, like the other.  That will leave it with\nhim to start whenever he likes.\"\n\n\"Yes! yes!\" cried Shelley.  \"That's much better!  Say, 'Come when you\nchoose!'\"\n\n\"Right!\" said Laddie as he wrote it.  \"Now I'll take this!\"\n\n\"Oh no you won't!\" cried Leon.  \"Father told me to saddle my horse.\nShe's got enough speed in her to beat yours a mile.  I take that!\nDidn't you say for me to saddle, father?\"\n\n\"Such important business, I think I better,\" said Laddie, and Leon\nbegan to cry.\n\n\"I think you should both go,\" said Shelley.  \"It is so important, and\nif one goes to make a mistake, maybe the other will notice it.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's the best way,\" said mother.\n\n\"Yes, both go,\" said father.\n\nIt was like one streak when they went up the Big Hill.  Father shook\nhis head.  \"Poor judgment--that,\" he said.  \"Never run a horse up hill!\"\n\n\"But they're in such a hurry,\" Shelley reminded him.\n\n\"So they are,\" said father.  \"In this case I might have broken the rule\nmyself.  Now come all of you, and let the child get at her mail.\"\n\n\"But I want you to stay,\" said Shelley.  \"I'm so addle-pated this\nmorning.  I need my family to help me.\"\n\n\"Of course you do, child,\" said mother.  \"Families were made to cling\ntogether, and stand by each other in every circumstance of life--joy or\nsorrow.  Of course you need your family.\"\n\nMay began sorting the letters by dates so Shelley could start on the\none that had been written first.  Father ran his knife across the top\nof each, and cut all the envelopes, and Shelley took out the first and\nread it; that was the train one.  In it he told her about sending the\nboy with the note again, and explained more about how it was so very\nimportant for him to hurry, because the only man who could help him was\nso sick.  We talked it over, and all of us thought the boy had kept the\nmoney and torn up the note.  Father said the way would have been to\nsend the note and pay the boy when he came back; but Shelley said Mr.\nPaget would have been gone before the boy got back, so father saw that\nwouldn't have been the way, in such a case.\n\nNext she read one written on the boat.  He told more about sending the\nboy; how he loved her, what it would mean to both of them if he got the\nevidence he wanted and won his first case; and how much it would bring\nhis friend.  The next one told it all over again, and more.  In that he\nwrote a little about the ocean, the people on board the ship, and he\ngave Shelley the name of the place where he was going and begged her to\nwrite to him.  He told her if the ship he was on passed another, they\nwere going to stop and send back the mail.  He begged her to write\noften, and to say she forgave him for starting away without seeing her,\nas he had been forced to.\n\nThe next one was the same thing over, only a little more yet.  In the\nlast he had reached England, the important man was still living, but he\nwas almost gone, and Mr. Paget took two good witnesses, all the\nevidence he had, and went to see him; and the man saw it was no use, so\nhe made a statement, and Robert had it all written out, signed and\nwitnessed.  For the real straight sense there was in that letter, I\ncould have done as well myself.\n\nIt was a wild jumble, because Robert was so crazy over having the\nevidence that would win his case; and he told Shelley that now he was\nperfectly free to love her all she would allow him.  He said he had to\nstay a while longer to find his friend's people so they would get back\ntheir share of the money, but it was not going to be easy to locate\nthem.  You wouldn't think the world so big, but maybe it seemed smaller\nto me because as far as I could see from the top of our house, was all\nI knew about it.  After Shelley had read the letters, and the note\nagain, father heaved a big sigh that seemed to come clear from his boot\nsoles and he said:  \"Well Shelley, it looks to me as if you had found a\nMAN.  Seems to me that's a mighty important case for a young lawyer to\nbe trusted with, in a first effort.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it was for Robert's best friend, and only think, he has won!\"\n\n\"I don't see how he could have done better if he'd been old as\nMethuselah, and wise as Solomon,\" boasted mother.\n\n\"But he hasn't found the people who must have back their money,\" said\nMay.  \"He will have to go to England again.  And he wants to take you,\nShelley.  My!  You'll get to sail on a big steamer, cross the Atlantic\nOcean, and see London.  Maybe you'll even get a peep at the Queen!\"\n\nShelley was busy making a little heap of her letters; when the top one\nslid off I reached over and put it back for her.  She looked straight\nat me, and smiled the most wonderful and the most beautiful smile I\never saw on any one's face, so I said to her: \"You see! I TOLD you he\nwas coming!\"\n\n\"I can't understand it!\" said Shelley.\n\n\"YOU KNOW I told you.\"\n\n\"Of course I do!  But what made you think so?\"\n\n\"That was the answer.  Just that he was coming.\"\n\n\"What are you two talking about?\" asked mother.\n\nShelley looked at me, and waited for me to tell mother as much as I\nwanted to, of what had happened.  But I didn't think things like that\nwere to be talked about before every one, so I just said:\n\n\"Oh nothing!  Only, I told Shelley this very morning that the Paget man\nwas coming soon, and that everything was going to be all right.\"\n\n\"You did?  Well of all the world!  I can't see why.\"\n\n\"Oh something told me! I just FELT that way.\"\n\n\"More of that Fairy nonsense?\" asked father sharply.\n\n\"No.  I didn't get that from the Fairies.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind!\" said Shelley, rising, because she saw that I had\ntold all I wanted to.  \"Little Sister DID tell me this morning that he\nwas coming, that everything would be made right, and it's the queerest\nthing, but instantly I believed her.  Didn't I sing all morning,\nmother?  The first note since Robert didn't come when I expected him in\nChicago, weeks ago.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said mother.  \"That's a wonderfully strange thing.  I can't see\nwhat made you think so.\"\n\n\"Anyway, I did!\" I said.  \"Now let's go have dinner.  I'm starving.\"\n\nI caught May's hand, and ran to get away from them.  Father and mother\nwalked one on each side of Shelley, while with both hands she held her\nletters before her.  When we reached the house we just talked about\nthem all the time.  Pretty soon the boys were back, and then they told\nabout sending the telegram.  Leon vowed he gave the operator a dime\nextra to start that message with a shove, so it would go faster.\n\n\"It will go all right,\" said Laddie, \"and how it will go won't be a\ncircumstance to the way he'll come.  If there's anything we ought to\ndo, before he gets here, we should hustle.  Chicago isn't a thousand\nmiles away.  That message can reach him by two o'clock, it's probable\nhe has got ready while he was waiting, so he will start on the first\ntrain our way.  He could reach Groveville on the ten, to-morrow.  We\nbetter meet it.\"\n\n\"Yes, we'll meet it,\" said mother.  \"Is the carriage perfectly clean?\"\n\nFather said:  \"It must be gone over.  Our general manager here ordered\nme to speed up, and we drove a little coming from town.\"\n\nMother went to planning what else should be done.\n\n\"Don't do anything!\" cried Shelley.  \"The house is all right.  There's\nno need to work and worry into a sweat.  He won't notice or care how\nthings look.\"\n\n\"I miss my guess if he doesn't notice and care very much indeed,\" said\nmother emphatically.  \"Men are not blind.  No one need think they don't\nsee when things are not as they should be, just because they're not\ncattish enough to let you know it, like a woman always does.  Shelley,\nwouldn't you like to ride over and spend the afternoon with the\nPrincess?\"\n\n\"Nope!\" said Shelley.  \"It's her turn to come to see me.  Besides, you\ndon't get me out of the way like that.  I know what you'll do here, and\nI intend to help.\"\n\n\"Do you need one of the boys at the house?\" asked father, and if you'll\nbelieve it, both of them wanted to stay.\n\nFather said he must have one to help wash the carriage and do a little\nfixing around the barn; so he took Leon, but he didn't like to go.  He\nsaid:  \"I don't see what all this fuss is about, anyway.  Probably\nhe'll be another Peter.\"\n\nShelley looked at him:  \"Oh Mr. Paget isn't nearly so large as Peter,\"\nshe said, \"and his hair is whiter than yours, while his eyes are not so\nblue.\"\n\n\"Saints preserve us!\" cried Leon.  \"Come on, father, let's only dust\nthe carriage!  He's not worth washing it for.\"\n\n\"Is he like that?\" asked mother anxiously.\n\n\"Wait and see!\" said Shelley.  \"Looks don't make a man.  He has proved\nwhat he can do.\"\n\nThen all of us went to work.  Before night we were hunting over the\nyard, and beside the road, to see if we could find anything to pick up.\nSix chickens were in the cellar, father was to bring meat and a long\nlist of groceries from town in the morning.  He was to start early, get\nthem before train time, put them under the back seat, and take them out\nafter he drove into the lane, when he came back.  That made a little\nmore trouble for father, but there was not the slightest necessity for\nmaking Mr. Paget feel that he had ridden in a delivery wagon.\n\nNext morning I wakened laughing softly, because some one was fussing\nwith my hair, patting my face, and kissing me, so I put up my arms and\npulled that loving person down on my pillow, and gave back little\nhalf-asleep kisses, and slept on; but it was Shelley, and she gently\nshook me and began repeating that fool old thing I have been waked up\nwith half the mornings of my life:\n\n  \"Get up, Little Sister, the morning is bright,\n  The birds are all singing to welcome the light,\n  Get up; for when all things are merry and glad,\n  Good children should never be lazy and sad;\n  For God gives us daylight, dear sister, that we\n  May rejoice like the lark and work like the bee.\"\n\n\nUsually I'd have gone on sleeping, but Shelley was so sweet and lovely,\nand she kissed me so hard, that I remembered it was going to be a most\nexciting day, so I came to quick as snap and jumped right up, for I\ndidn't want to miss a single thing that might happen.\n\nThe carriage was shining when it came to the gate, so was father.\n\nI thought there was going to be a vacant seat beside him, and I asked\nif I might go along.  He said:  \"Yes, if mother says so.\" He always\nwould stick that in.  So I ran to ask her, and she didn't care, if\nShelley made no objections.  I was just starting to find her, when here\nshe came, all shining too, but Laddie was with her.  I hadn't known\nthat he was going, and I was so disappointed I couldn't help crying.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Shelley.\n\n\"Father and mother both said I might go, if you didn't care.\"\n\n\"Why, I'm dreadfully sorry,\" said Shelley, \"but I have several things I\nwant Laddie to do for me.\"\n\nLaddie stooped down to kiss me good-bye and he said:  \"Don't cry,\nLittle Sister.  The way to be happy is to be good.\"\n\nThen they drove to Groveville, and we had to wait.  But there was so\nmuch to do, it made us fly to get all of it finished.  So mother sent\nLeon after Mrs. Freshett to help in the kitchen, while Candace wore her\nwhite dress, and waited on the table.  Mother cut flowers for the\ndining table, and all through the house.  She left the blinds down to\nkeep the rooms cool, chilled buttermilk to drink, and if she didn't\nthink of every single, least little thing, I couldn't see what it was.\nThen all of us put on our best dresses.  Mother looked as glad and\nsweet as any girl, when she sat to rest a little while.  I didn't dare\nclimb the catalpa in my white dress, so I watched from the horse block,\nand when I saw the grays come over the top of the hill, I ran to tell.\nAs mother went to the gate, she told May and me to walk behind, to stay\nback until we were spoken to, and then to keep our heads level, and\nremember our manners.  I don't know where Leon went.  He said he lost\nall interest when he found there was to be another weak-eyed towhead in\nthe family, and I guess he was in earnest about it, because he wasn't\neven curious enough to be at the gate when Mr. Paget came.\n\nFather stopped with a flourish, Laddie hurried around and helped\nShelley, and then Mr. Paget stepped down.  Goodness, gracious, sakes\nalive!  Little?  Towhead?  He was taller than Laddie.  His hair was\nmost as black as ink, and wavy.  His eyes were big and dark; he was\nbroad and strong and there was the cleanest, freshest look about him.\nHe put his arm spang around Shelley, right there in the road, and\nmother said:  \"Hold there!  Not so fast, young man!  I haven't given my\nconsent to that.\"\n\nHe laughed, and he said:  \"Yes, but you'ah going to!\"  And he put his\nother arm around mother, so May and I crowded up, and we had a family\nreunion right between the day lilies and the snowball bush.  We went\ninto the house, and he LIKED us, his room, and everything went exactly\nright.  He was crazy about the cold buttermilk, and while he was\ndrinking it Leon walked into the dining-room, because he thought of\ncourse Mr. Paget and Shelley would be on the davenport in the parlour.\nWhen he saw Robert he said lowlike to Shelley:  \"Didn't Mr. Paget come?\nWho's that?\"\n\nShelley looked so funny for a minute, then she remembered what she had\ntold him and she just laughed as she said:  \"Mr. Paget, this is my\nbrother.\"\n\nRobert went to shake hands, and Leon said right to his teeth: \"Well a\ndivil of a towhead you are!\"\n\n\"Towhead?\" said Robert, bewildered-like.\n\n\"Shelley said you were a little bit of a man, with watery blue eyes,\nand whiter hair than mine.\"\n\n\"Oh I say!\" cried Robert.  \"She must have been stringin' you!\"\n\nLeon just whooped; because while Mr. Paget didn't talk like the 'orse,\n'ouse people, he made you think of them in the way he said things, and\nthe sound of his voice.  Then we had dinner, and I don't remember that\nwe ever had quite such a feast before.  Mother had put on every single\nflourish she knew.  She used her very best dishes, and linen, and no\ncook anywhere could beat Candace alone; now she had Mrs. Freshett to\nhelp her, and mother also.  If she tried to show Mr. Paget, she did it!\nNo visitor was there except him, but we must have been at the table two\nhours talking, and eating from one dish after another.  Candace LIKED\nto wear her white dress, and carry things around, and they certainly\nwere good.\n\nAnd talk!  Father, Laddie, and Robert talked over all creation.  Every\nonce in a while when mother saw an opening, she put in her paddle, and\nno one could be quicker, when she watched sharp and was trying to make\na good impression.  Shelley was very quiet; she scarcely spoke or\ntouched that delicious food.  Once the Paget man turned to her, looking\nat her so fondlike, as he picked up one of her sauce dishes and her\nspoon and wanted to feed her.  And he said:  \"Heah child, eat your\ndinnah!  You have nawthing to be fussed ovah!  I mean to propose to\nyou, and your parents befowr night.  That is what I am heah for.\"\n\nEvery one laughed so, Shelley never got the bite; but after that she\nperked up more and ate a little by herself.\n\nAt last father couldn't stand it any longer, so he began asking Robert\nabout his trip to England, and the case he had won.  When the table was\ncleared for dessert, Mr. Paget asked mother to have Candace to bring\nhis satchel.  He opened it and spread papers all over, so that father\nand Laddie could see the evidence, while he told them how it was.\n\nIt seemed there was a law in England, all of us knew about it, because\nfather often had explained it.  This law said that a man who had lots\nof money and land must leave almost all of it to his eldest son; and\nthe younger ones must go into law, the army, be clergymen, or enter\ntrade and earn a living, while the eldest kept up the home place.  Then\nhe left it to his eldest son, and his other boys had to work for a\nliving.  It kept the big estates together; but my! it was hard on the\nyounger sons, and no one seemed even to think about the daughters.  I\nnever heard them mentioned.\n\nNow there was a very rich man; he had only two sons, and each of them\nmarried, and had one son.  The younger son died, and sent his boy for\nhis elder brother to take care of.  He pretended to be good, but for\nsure, he was bad as ever he could be.  He knew that if his cousin were\nout of the way, all that land and money would be his when his uncle\ndied.  So he went to work and he tried for years, and a lawyer man who\nhad no conscience at all, helped him.  At last when they had done\neverything they could think of, they took a lot of money and put it in\nthe pocket of the son they wanted to ruin; then when his father missed\nthe money, and the house was filled with policemen, detectives, and\nneighbours, the bad man said he'd feel more comfortable to have the\nfamily searched too, merely as a formality, so he stepped out and was\ngone over, and when the son's turn came, there was the money on him!\nThat made him a public disgrace to his family, and a criminal who\ncouldn't inherit the estate, and his father went raving mad and tried\nto kill him, so he had to run away.  At first he didn't care what he\ndid, so he came over here.  Robert said that man was his best friend,\nand as men went, he was a decent fellow, so he cheered him up all he\ncould, and went to work with all his might to prove he was innocent,\nand to get back his family, and his money for him.\n\nWhen Robert had enough evidence that he was almost ready to start to\nEngland, his man got a cable from an old friend of his father's, who\nalways had believed in him, and it said that the bad man was dying--to\ncome quick.  So Robert went all of a sudden, like the Dead Letters told\nabout.  Now, he described how he reached there, took the old friend of\nthe father of his friend with him, and other witnesses, and all the\nevidence he had, and went to see the sick man.  When Robert showed him\nwhat he could prove, the bad man said it was no use, he had to die in a\nfew days, so he might as well go with a clean conscience, and he told\nabout everything he had done.  Robert had it all written out, signed\nand sworn to.  He told about all of it, and then he said to father:\n\"Have I made it clear to you?\"\n\nLeon was so excited he forgot all the manners he ever had, for he\npopped up before father could open his head, and cried: \"Clear as mud!\nI got that son business so plain in my mind, I'd know the party of the\nfirst part, from the party of the second part, if I met him promenading\non the Stone Wall of China!\"\n\nFather and Laddie knew so much law they asked dozens of questions; but\nthat Robert man wasn't a smidgin behind, for every clip he had the\nanswer ready, and then he could go on and tell much more than he had\nbeen asked.  He said as a Case, it was a pretty thing to work on; but\nit was much more than a case to him, because he always had known that\nhis friend was not guilty; that he was separated from his family,\nsuffering terribly under the disgrace, and they must be also.  He had\nworked for life for his friend, because the whole thing meant so much\nto both of them.  He said he must go back soon and finish up a little\nmore that he should have done while he was there, if it hadn't been\nthat he received no word from Shelley.\n\n\"When I didn't heah from heh for so long, and wrote so many letters,\nand had no reply, I thought possibly some gay 'young Lochinvah had come\nout from the west,' and taken my sweet 'eart,\" he said, \"and while I\nhad my armour on, I made up my mind that I'd give him a fight too.  I\ndidn't propose to lose Shelley, if it were in my powah to win heh.  I\nhadn't been able to say to heh exactly what I desiahed, on account of\ngetting a start alone in this country; but if I won this case, I would\nhave ample means.  When I secuahed the requiahed evidence, I couldn't\nwait to finish, so I came straight ovah, to make sure of heh.\"\n\nHe arose and handed the satchel to father.\n\n\"I notice you have a very good looking gun convenient,\" he said.\n\"Would you put these papahs where you consider them safe until I'm\nready to return?  Our home, our living, and the honah of a man are\nthere, and we are mighty particular about that bag, are we not,\nShelley?\"\n\n\"Well I should think we are!\" cried Shelley.  \"For goodness sake,\nfather, hang to it!  Is the man still living?  Could you get that\nevidence over again?\"\n\n\"He was alive when I left, but the doctors said ten days would be his\nlimit, so he may be gone befowr this.\"\n\nFather picked up the satchel, set it on his knees, and stroked it as if\nit were alive.\n\n\"Well!  Well!\" he said.  \"Now would any one think such a little thing\ncould contain so much?\"\n\nShelley leaned toward Robert.\n\n\"Your friend!\" she cried, \"Your friend!  What DID he say to you?  What\ndid he DO?\"\n\n\"Well, for a time he was wildly happy ovah having the stain removed\nfrom his honah, and knowing that he would have his family and faw'tn\nback; but there is an extremely sad feature to his case that is not yet\nsettled, so he must keep his head level until we work that out.  Now\nabout that hoss you wanted to show me----\" he turned to Leon.\n\nMother gave the signal, and we left the table.  Father carried the\nsatchel to his chest, made room for it, locked it in and put the key in\nhis pocket.  Then our men started to the barn to show the Arab-Kentucky\nhorse.  Mr. Paget went to Shelley and took her in his arms exactly like\nPeter did Sally before the parlour door that time when I got into\ntrouble, and he looked at mother and laughed as he said:  \"I hope you\nwill excuse me, but I've been having a very nawsty, anxious time, and I\ncawn't conform to the rules for a few days, until I become accustomed\nto the fawct that Shelley is not lost to me.  It was beastly when I\nreached Chicago, had back all my letters, and found she had gone home\nill.  I've much suffering to recompense.  I'll atone for a small\nportion immediately.\"\n\nHe lifted Shelley right off the floor--that's how big and strong he\nwas--he hugged her tight, and kissed her forehead, cheeks, and eyes.\n\n\"When I've gone through the fahmality of asking your parents for you,\nand they have said a gracious 'yes,' I'll put the fust one on your\nlips,\" he said, setting her down carefully.  \"In the meantime, you be\nfixing your mouth to say, 'yes,' also, when I propose to you, because\nit's coming befowr you sleep.\"\n\nShelley was like a peach blossom.  She reached up and touched his\ncheek, while she looked at mother all smiling, and sparkling, as she\nsaid:  \"You see!\"\n\nMother smiled back.\n\n\"I do, indeed!\" she answered.\n\nLeon pulled Mr. Paget's sleeve.\n\n\"Aw quit lally-gaggin' and come see a real horse,\" he said.\n\nRobert put his other arm around Leon, drew him to his side and hugged\nhim as if he were a girl.  \"I'm so glad Shelley has a lawge family,\" he\nsaid.  \"Big families are jolly.  I'm so proud of all the brothers I'm\ngoing to have.  I was the only boy at home.\"\n\n\"You haven't told us about your family,\" said mother.\n\n\"No,\" said Robert, \"but I intend to.  I have a family!  One of the\nfinest on uth.  We'll talk about them after this hoss is inspected.\"\n\nHe let Shelley go and walked away, his arm still around Leon.  Shelley\nran to mother and both of them sobbed out loud.\n\n\"NOW YOU SEE HOW IT WAS!\" she said.\n\n\"You poor child!\" cried mother.  \"Indeed I DO see how it was.  You've\nbeen a brave girl.  A good, brave girl!  Father and I are mighty proud\nof you!\"\n\n\"Oh mother!  I thought you were ashamed of me!\" sobbed Shelley.\n\n\"Oh my child!\" said mother quavery-like.  \"Oh my child!  You surely see\nthat none of us could understand, as we do now.\"\n\nShe patted Shelley, and told her to run upstairs and lie down for a\nwhile, because she was afraid she would be sick.\n\n\"We mustn't have a pale, tired girl right now,\" said mother.\n\n\"Well!\" said Shelley, but she just stood there holding mother.\n\n\"Well?\" said mother gripping her.\n\n\"You see!\" said Shelley.\n\n\"Child,\" said mother, \"I DO see!  I see six feet of as handsome manhood\nas I ever have seen anywhere.  His manner is perfect, and I find his\nspeech most attractive.  I am delighted with him.  I do see indeed!\nYour father is quite as proud and pleased as I am.  Now go to bed.\"\n\nShelley held up her lips, and then went.  I ran to the barn, where the\nmen were standing in the shade, while Leon led his horse up and down\nbefore them, told about its pedigree, its record, how he came to have\nit.  The Paget man stood there looking and listening gravely, as he\nstudied the horse.  At last he went over her, and gee! but he knew\nhorse!  Then Laddie brought out Flos and they talked all about her, and\nthen went into the barn.  Father opened the east doors to show how much\nland he had, which were his lines; and while the world didn't look\nquite so pretty as it had in May, still it was good enough.  Then they\nwent into the orchard, sat under the trees and began talking about\nbusiness conditions.  That was so dry I went back to the house.  And\nmaybe I didn't strike something interesting there!\n\nAs I came up the orchard path to a back yard gate, I saw a carriage at\nthe hitching rack in front of the house, so I took a peep and almost\nfell over.  It was the one the Princess had come to Sally's wedding in;\nso I knew she was in the house visiting Shelley.  I went to the parlour\nand there I had another shock; for lo and behold! in our big rocking\nchair, and looking as well as any one, so far as you could see--of\ncourse you can't see heart trouble, though--sat Mrs. Pryor.  The\nPrincess and mother were there, all of them talking, laughing and\nhaving the best time, while on the davenport enjoying himself as much\nas any one, was Mr. Pryor.  They talked about everything, and it was\neasy to see that the Pryor door was OPEN so far as we were concerned,\nanyway.  Mrs. Pryor was just as nice and friendly as she could be, and\nso was he.  Shelley sat beside him, and he pinched her cheek and said:\n\"Something seems to make you especially brilliant today, young woman!\"\n\nShelley flushed redder, laughed, and glanced at mother, so she said:\n\"Shelley is having a plain old-fashioned case of beau.  She met a young\nman in Chicago last fall and he's here now to ask our consent.  All of\nus are quite charmed with him.  That's why she's so happy.\"\n\nThen the Princess sprang up and kissed Shelley, so did Mrs. Pryor,\nwhile such a chatter you never heard.  No one could repeat what they\nsaid, for as many as three talked at the same time.\n\n\"Oh do let's have a double wedding!\" cried the Princess when the\nexcitement was over a little.  \"I think it would be great fun; do\nlet's!  When are you planning for?\"\n\n\"Nothing is settled yet,\" said Shelley.  \"We've had no time to talk!\"\n\n\"Mercy!\" cried the Princess.  \"Go make your arrangements quickly!\nHurry up, then come over, and we'll plan for the same time.  It will be\nsplendid!  Don't you think that would be fine, Mrs. Stanton?\"\n\n\"I can't see any objections to it,\" said mother.\n\n\"Where is your young man?  I'm crazy to see him,\" cried the Princess.\n\"If you have gone and found a better looking one than mine, I'll never\nspeak to you again.\"\n\n\"She hasn't!\" cried Mrs. Pryor calmly, like that settled it.  I like\nher.  \"They're not made!\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said Shelley proudly.  \"Mother, isn't my\nman quite as good looking, and as nice in every way, as Laddie?\"\n\n\"Fully as handsome, and so far as can be seen in such a short time,\nquite as fine,\" said mother.\n\nI was perfectly amazed at her; as if any man could be!\n\n\"I don't believe it, I won't stand it, and I shan't go home until I\nhave seen for myself!\" cried the Princess, laughing, and yet it sounded\nas if she were half-provoked, and I knew I was.  The Paget man was all\nright, but I wasn't going to lose my head over him.  Laddie was the\nfinest, of course!\n\n\"Well, he's somewhere on the place with our men, this minute,\" said\nShelley, \"but you stay for supper, and meet him.\"\n\n\"When you haven't your arrangements made yet!  You surely are\nunselfish!  Of course I won't do that, but I'd love to have one little\npeep, then you bring him and come over to-morrow, so all of us can\nbecome acquainted, and indeed, I'm really in earnest about a double\nwedding.\"\n\n\"Go see where the men are,\" said Shelley to me.\n\nI went to the back door, and their heads were bobbing far down in the\norchard.\n\n\"They're under the greening apple tree,\" I reported.\n\n\"If you will excuse us,\" said Shelley to Mr. and Mrs. Pryor, \"we'll\nwalk down a few minutes and prove that I'm right.\"\n\n\"Don't stay,\" said Mrs. Pryor.  \"This trip is so unusual for me that\nI'm quite tired.  For a first venture, in such a long time, I think\nI've done well.  But now I'm beginning to feel I should go home.\"\n\n\"Go straight along,\" said the Princess.  \"I'll walk across the fields,\nor Thomas can come back after me.\"\n\nSo Mr. and Mrs. Pryor went away, while the Princess, Shelley, May, and\nI walked through the orchard toward the men.  They were standing on the\ntop of the hill looking over the meadow, and talking with such interest\nthey didn't hear us or turn until Shelley said:  \"Mr. Paget, I want to\npresent you to Laddie's betrothed--Miss Pamela Pryor.\"\n\nHe swung around, finishing what he was saying as he turned, the\nPrincess took a swift step toward him, then, at the same time, both of\nthem changed to solid tombstone, and stood staring, and so did all of\nus, while no one made a sound.  At last the Paget man drew a deep,\nquivery breath and sort of shook himself as he gazed at her.\n\n\"Why, Pam!\" he cried.  \"Darling Pam, cawn it possibly be you?\"\n\nIf you ever heard the scream of a rabbit when the knives of a reaper\ncut it to death, why that's exactly the way she cried out.\n\nShe covered her eyes with her hands.  He drew back and smiled, the red\nrushed into his face, and he began to be alive again.  Laddie went to\nthe Princess and took her hands.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" he begged.\n\nShe pulled away from him, and went to the Paget man slowly, her big\neyes wild and strained.\n\n\"Robert!\" she cried.  \"Robert! how did you get here?  Were you hunting\nus?\"\n\n\"All ovah England, yes,\" he said.  \"Not heah!  I came heah to see\nShelley.  But you?  How do you happen to be in this country?\"\n\n\"We've lived on adjoining land for two years!\"\n\n\"You moved heah!  To escape the pity of our friends?\"\n\n\"Father moved!  Mother and I had no means, and no refuge.  We were\nforced.  We never believed it!  Oh Robert, we never--not for a minute!\nOh Robert, say you never did it!\"\n\n\"Try our chawming cousin Emmet your next guess!\"\n\n\"That devil!  Oh that devil!\"\n\nShe cried out that hurt way again, so he took her tight in his arms;\nbut sure as ever Laddie was my brother, he was hers, so that was all\nright.  When they were together you wondered why in this world you\nhadn't thought of it the instant you saw him alone.  They were like as\ntwo peas.  They talked exactly the same, only he sounded much more so,\nprobably from having just been in England for weeks, while in two years\nshe had grown a little as we were.  We gazed at them, open-mouthed,\nlike as not, and no one said a word.\n\nAt last Mr. Paget looked over the Princess' shoulder at father and\nsaid:  \"I can explain this, Mr. Stanton, in a very few wuds.  I am my\nfriend.  The case was my own.  The evidence I secuahed was for myself.\nThis is my only sisteh.  Heh people are mine----\"\n\n\"The relationship is apparent,\" said father.  \"There is a striking\nlikeness between you and your sister, and I can discern traces of your\nparents in your face, speech and manner.\"\n\n\"If you know my father,\" said Robert, \"then you undehstand what\nhappened to me when I was found with his money on my pehson, in the\npresence of our best friends and the police.  He went raving insane on\nthe instant, and he would have killed me if he hadn't been prevented;\nhe tried to; has he changed any since, Pam?\"\n\nThe Princess was clinging to him with both hands, staring at him,\nwonder, joy, and fear all on her lovely face.\n\n\"Worse!\" she cried.  \"He's much worse!  The longer he broods, the more\nmother grieves, the bitterer he becomes.  Mr. Stanton, he is always\narmed.  He'll shoot on sight.  Oh what shall we do?\"\n\n\"Miss Pamela,\" said Leon, \"did your man Thomas know your brother in\nEngland?\"\n\n\"All his life.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we'd better be doing something quick.  He tied the horses\nand was walking up and down the road while he waited, and he saw us\nplainly when we crossed the wood yard a while ago.  He followed us and\nstared so, I couldn't help noticing him.\"\n\n\"Jove!\" cried Robert.  \"I must have seen him in the village this\nmorning.  A man reminded me of him, then I remembered how like people\nof his type are, and concluded I was mistaken.  Mr. Stanton, you have\nagreed that the evidence I hold is sufficient.  Pam cawn tell you that\nwhile I don't deny being full of tricks as a boy, they weh not dirty,\nnot low, and while father always taking Emmet's paht against me drove\nme to recklessness sometimes, I nevah did anything underhand or\ndisgraceful.  She knows what provocation I had, and exactly what\nhappened.  Let heh tell you!\"\n\n\"I don't feel that I require any further information,\" said father.\n\"You see, I happen to be fairly well acquainted with Mr. Pryor.\"\n\n\"Pryor?\"\n\n\"He made us use that name here,\" explained the Princess.\n\n\"WELL, HIS NAME IS PAGET!\" said Robert angrily.\n\nLaddie told me long ago he didn't believe it was Pryor.\n\n\"Then, if you are acquainted with my father, what would you counsel?\nUnless I'm prepahed to furnish the central figyah of interest in a\nfuneral, I dare not meet him, until he has seen this evidence, had time\nto digest it, and calm himself.\"\n\nShelley caught him by the arm.  No wonder!  She hadn't been proposed\nto, or even had a kiss on her lips.  She pulled him.\n\n\"You come straight to the house,\" she said.  \"Thomas may tell your\nfather he thought he saw you.\"\n\nThat was about as serious as anything could be, but nothing ever\nstopped Leon.  He sidled away from father, repeating in a low voice:\n\n  \"'For sore dismayed, through storm and shade\n    His child he did discover;\n  One lovely hand she stretched for aid,\n    And one was round her lover--'\"\n\n\nShelley just looked daggers at him, but she was too anxious to waste\nany time.\n\n\"Would Thomas tell your father?\" she asked the Princess.\n\n\"The instant he saw him alone, yes.  He wouldn't before mother.\"\n\n\"Hold one minute!\" cried father.  \"We must think of our mother, just a\nlittle.  Shelley, you and the girls run up and explain how this is.\nBetter all of you go to the house, except Mr. Paget.  He'll be safe\nhere as anywhere.  Mr. Pryor will stop there, if he comes.  So it would\nbe best for you to keep out of sight, Robert, until I have had a little\ntalk with him.\"\n\n\"I'll stay here,\" I offered.  \"We'll talk until you get Mr. Pryor\ncooled off.  He can be awful ragesome when he's excited, and it doesn't\ntake much to start him.\"\n\n\"You're right about that!\" agreed Robert.\n\nSo we sat under the greening and were having a fine visit while the\nothers went to break the news gently to mother that the Pryor mystery\nhad gone up higher than Gilderoy's kite.  My! but she'd be glad!  It\nwould save her many a powerful prayer.  I was telling Robert all about\nthe time his father visited us, and what my mother said to him, and he\nsaid:  \"She'd be the one to talk with him now.  Possibly he'd listen to\nher, until he got it through his head that his own son is not a common\nthief.\"\n\n\"Maybe he'll have to be held, like taking quinine, and made to listen,\"\nI said.\n\n\"That would be easy, if he were not a walking ahsenal,\" said Robert.\n\"You have small chance to reason with a half-crazy man while he is\nhandling a pistol.\"\n\nHe meant revolver.\n\n\"But he'll shoot!\" I cried.  \"The Princess said he'd shoot!\"\n\n\"So he will!\" said Robert.  \"Shoot first, then find out how things are,\nand kill himself and every one else with remorse, afterward.  He is\nmade that way.\"\n\n\"Then he doesn't dare see you until he finds out how mistaken he has\nbeen,\" I said, for I was growing to like Robert better every minute\nlonger I knew him.  Besides, there was the Princess, looking like him\nas possible, and loving him of course, like I did Laddie, maybe.  And\nif anything could cure Mrs. Pryor's heart trouble, having her son back\nwould, because that was what made it in the first place, and even\nbefore them, there was Shelley to be thought of, and cared for.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nThe Pryor Mystery\n\n  \"And now old Dodson, turning pale,\n  Yields to his fate--so ends my tale.\"\n\n\nIt didn't take me long to see why Shelley liked Robert Paget.  He was\none of the very most likeable persons I ever had seen.  We were sitting\nunder the apple tree, growing better friends every minute, when we\nheard a smash, so we looked up, and it was the sound made by Ranger as\nMr. Pryor landed from taking our meadow fence.  He had ridden through\nthe pasture, and was coming down the creek bank.  He was a spectacle to\nbehold.  A mile away you could see that Thomas had told him he had seen\nRobert, and where he was.  Father had been mistaken in thinking Mr.\nPryor would go to the house.  He had lost his hat, his white hair was\nflying, his horse was in a lather, and he seemed to be talking to\nhimself.  Robert took one good look.  \"Ye Gods!\" he cried.  \"There he\ncomes now, a chattering madman!\"\n\n\"The Station,\" I panted.  \"Up that ravine!  Roll back the stone and\npull the door shut after you.  Quick!\"\n\nHe never could have been inside, before Mr. Pryor's horse was raving\nalong the embankment beside the fence.\n\n\"Where is he?\" he cried.  \"Thomas saw him here!\"\n\nI didn't think his horse could take the fence at the top of the hill,\nbut it looked as if he intended trying to make it, and I had to stop\nhim if I could.\n\n\"Saw who?\" I asked with clicking teeth.\n\n\"A tall, slender man, with a handsome face, and the heart of a devil.\"\n\n\"Yes, there was a man here like that in the face.  I didn't see his\nheart,\" I said.\n\n\"Which way?\" raved Mr. Pryor.  \"Which way?  Is he at your house?\"\n\nThen I saw that he had the reins in his left hand, and a big revolver\nin his right.  So there was no mistake about whether he'd really shoot.\nBut that gun provoked me.  People have no business to be careless with\nthose things.  They're dangerous!\n\n\"He didn't do what you think he did,\" I cried, \"and he can prove he\ndidn't, if you'll stop cavorting, and listen to reason.\"\n\nMr. Pryor leaned over the fence, dark purple like a beet now.\n\n\"You tell me where he is, or I'll choke it out of you,\" he said.\n\nI guess he meant it.  I took one long look at his lean, clawlike\nfingers, and put both hands around my neck.\n\n\"He knew Thomas saw him.  He went that way,\" I said, waving off toward\nthe north.\n\n\"Hah! striking for petticoats, as usual!\" he cried, and away he went in\nthe direction of his house.  Then I flew for the Station.\n\n\"Come from there, quick!\" I cried.  \"I've sent him back to his house,\nbut when he finds you're not there, he will come here again.  Hurry,\nand I'll put you in the woodshed loft.  He'd never think of looking\nthere.\"\n\nHe came out and we started toward the house, going pretty fast.  Almost\nto the back gate we met Shelley.\n\n\"Does mother know?\" I asked.\n\n\"I just told her,\" she said.\n\n\"Father,\" I cried, going in the back dining-room door.  \"Mr. Pryor was\ndown in the meadow on Ranger.  Thomas did see Robert, and his father is\nhunting him with a gun.  We saw him coming, so I hid Robert in the\nStation and sent Mr. Pryor back home--I guess I told him a lie, father,\nor at least part of one, I said he went 'that way,' and he did, but not\nso far as I made his father think; so he started back home, but when he\ngets there and doesn't find Robert he'll come here again, madder than\never.  Oh father, he'll come again, and he's crazy, father!  Clear,\nraving crazy!  I know he'll come again!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said father calmly.  \"I think it very probable that he will come\nagain.\"\n\nThen he started around shutting and latching windows, closing and\nlocking the doors, and he carefully loaded his gun, and leaned it\nagainst the front casing.  Then he put on his glasses, and began\nexamining the papers they had brought out again.  Robert stood beside\nhim, and explained and showed him.\n\n\"You see with me out of the way, the English law would give everything\nto my cousin,\" he said, and he explained it all over again.\n\n\"And to think how he always posed for a perfect saint!\" cried the\nPrincess.  \"Oh I hope the devil knows how to make him pay for what all\nof us have suffered!\"\n\n\"Child!  Child!\" cried mother.\n\n\"I can't help it!\" said the Princess.  \"Let me tell you, Mr. Stanton.\"\n\nThen SHE told everything all over again, but it was even more\ninteresting than the way Robert explained it, because what she said was\nabout how it had been with her and her mother.\n\n\"It made father what he is,\" she said.  \"He would have killed Robert,\nif our friends hadn't helped him away.  He will now, if he isn't\nstopped.  I tell you he will!  He sold everything he could legally\ncontrol, for what any one chose to give him, and fled here stricken in\npride, heartbroken, insane with anger, the creature you know.  In a\nminute he'll be back again.  Oh what are we going to do?\"\n\nFather was laying out the papers that he wanted to use very carefully.\n\n\"These constitute all the proof any court would require,\" he said to\nRobert.  \"If he returns, all of you keep from sight.  This is my house;\nI'll manage who comes here, in my own way.\"\n\n\"But you must be allowed to take no risk!\" cried Robert.  \"I cawn't\nconsent to youah facing danger for me.\"\n\n\"There will be no risk,\" said father.  \"There is no reason why he\nshould want to injure me.  As the master of this house, I am accustomed\nto being obeyed.  If he comes, step into the parlour there, until I\ncall you.\"\n\nHe was busy with the papers when he saw Mr. Pryor coming.  I wondered\nif he would jump the yard fence and ride down mother's flowers, but he\nleft his horse at the hitching rack, and pounded on the front door.\n\n\"Did any of you notice whether he was displaying a revolver?\" asked\nfather.\n\n\"Yes father!  Yes!\" I cried.  \"And he's shaking so I'm afraid he'll\nmake it go, when he doesn't intend to.\"\n\nFather picked up and levelled his rifle on the front door.\n\n\"Leon,\" he said, \"you're pretty agile.  Open this door, keep yourself\nbehind it, and step around in the parlour.  The rest of you get out,\nand stay out of range.\"\n\nThose nearest hurried into the parlour.  Candace, May, and I crouched\nin the front stairway, but things were so exciting we just had to keep\nthe door open a tiny crack so we could see plain as anything.  There\nhad been nothing for Mrs. Freshett to do all afternoon, so she had gone\nover to visit an hour with Amanda Deam.  Now Mr. Pryor probably thought\nfather would meet him with the Bible in his hand, and read a passage\nabout loving your neighbour as yourself.  I'll bet anything you can\nmention that he never expected to find himself looking straight down\nthe barrel of a shining big rifle when that door swung open.  It\nsurprised him so, he staggered, and his arm wavered.  If he had shot\nand hit anything then, it would have been an accident.\n\n\"Got you over the heart,\" said father, in precisely the same voice he\nalways said, \"This is a fine day we are having.\"  \"Now why are you\ncoming here in such a shape?\"  This was a little cross.  \"I'm not the\nman to cringe before you!\"  This was quite boastful.  \"You'll get\nbullet for bullet, if you attempt to invade my house with a gun.\"  This\npinged as if father shot words instead of bullets.\n\n\"I want my daughter to come home,\" said Mr. Pryor.  \"And if you're\nsheltering the thief she is trying to hide, yield him up, if you would\nsave yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not anxious about dying, with the family I have on my hands,\nneighbour,\" said father, his rifle holding without a waver, \"but unless\nyou put away that weapon, and listen to reason, you cannot enter my\nhouse.  Calm yourself, man, and hear what there is to be said!  Examine\nthe proof, that is here waiting to be offered to you.\"\n\n\"Once and but once, send them out, or I'll enter over you!\" cried Mr.\nPryor.\n\n\"Sorry,\" said father, \"but if only a muscle of your trigger finger\nmoves, you fall before I do.  I've the best range, and the most\nsuitable implement for the work.\"\n\n\"Implement for the work!\"  Well, what do you think of father?  Any one\nwho could not see, to have heard him, would have thought he was talking\nabout a hoe.  We saw a shadow before we knew what made it; then, a\nlittle at a time, wonderingly, her jolly face a bewildered daze, her\nmouth slowly opening, Mrs. Freshett, half-bent and peering, stooped\nunder Mr. Pryor's arm and looked in our door.  She had come back to\nhelp get supper, and because the kitchen was locked, she had gone\naround the house to see if she could get in at the front.  What she saw\nclosed her mouth, and straightened her back.\n\n\"WHY, YOU TWO OLD FOOLS!\" she cried.  \"IF YE AIN'T DRAWED A BEAD ON\nEACH OTHER!\"\n\nNone of us saw her do it.  We only knew after it was over what must\nhave happened.  She had said she'd risk her life for mother.\n\nShe never stopped an instant when her chance came.  She must have\nturned, and thrown her big body against Mr. Pryor.  He was tired, old,\nand shaking with anger.  They went down together, she gripping his\nright wrist with both hands, and she was strong as most men.  Father\nset the gun beside the door, and bent over them.  A minute more and he\nhanded the revolver to Leon, and helped Mrs. Freshett to her feet.  Mr.\nPryor lay all twisted on the walk, his face was working, and what he\nsaid was a stiff jabber no one could understand.  He had broken into\nthe pieces we often feared he would.\n\nRobert and Laddie came running to help father carry him in, and lay him\non the couch.\n\n\"I hope, Miss Stanton,\" said Mrs. Freshett, \"that I wa'n't too rough\nwith him.  He was so shaky-like, I was 'feered that thing would go off\nwithout his really makin' it, and of course I couldn't see none of\nyourn threatened with a deadly weepon, 'thout buttin' in and doin' the\nbest I could.\"\n\nMother put her arms around her as far as they would reach.  She would\nhave had to take her a side at a time to really hug all of her, and she\nsaid:  \"Mrs. Freshett, you are an instrument in the hands of the Lord\nthis day.  Undoubtedly you have kept us from a fearful tragedy;\npossibly you have saved my husband for me.  None of us ever can thank\nyou enough.\"\n\n\"Loosen his collar and give him air,\" said Mrs. Freshett pushing mother\naway.  \"I think likely he has bust a blood vessel.\"\n\nFather sent Leon flying to bring Dr. Fenner.  Laddie took the carriage\nand he and Robert went after Mrs. Pryor, while father, mother, Mrs.\nFreshett, the Princess, May, and I, every last one, worked over Mr.\nPryor.  We poured hot stuff down his throat, put warm things around\nhim, and rubbed him until the sweat ran on us, trying to get his\nknotted muscles straightened out.  When Dr. Fenner came he said we were\ndoing all he could; MAYBE Mr. Pryor would come to and be all right, and\nmaybe his left side would be helpless forever; it was a stroke.  Seemed\nto me having Mrs. Freshett come against you like that, could be called\na good deal more than a stroke, but I couldn't think of the right word\nthen.  And after all, perhaps stroke was enough.  He couldn't have been\nmuch worse off if the barn had fallen on him.  I didn't think there was\nquite so much of Mrs. Freshett; but then she was scared, and angry; and\nhe was about ready to burst, all by himself, if no one had touched him.\nHe had much better have stayed at home and listened to what was to be\nsaid, reasonably, like father would; and then if he really had to\nshoot, he would have been in some kind of condition to take aim.\n\nAfter a long hard fight we got him limber, straightened out, and warm,\nit didn't rip so when he breathed, then they put him in the parlour on\nthe big davenport.  Leon said if the sparkin' bench didn't bring him\nto, nothing would.  Laddie sat beside him and mother kept peeping.  She\nwouldn't let Dr. Fenner go, because she said Mr. Pryor just must come\nout of it right, and have a few years of peace and happiness.\n\nMrs. Pryor came back with Laddie and Robert.  He carried her in, put\nher in the big rocking chair again, and he sat beside her, stroking and\nkissing her, while she held him with both hands.  You could see NOW why\nhis mother couldn't sleep, walked the road, and held her hands over her\nheart.  She was a brave woman, and she had done well to keep alive and\ngoing in any shape at all.  You see we knew.  There had been only the\nfew hours when it seemed possible that one of our boys had taken\nfather's money and was gone.  I well remembered what happened to our\nmother then.  And if she had been disgraced before every one, dragged\nfrom her home away across a big sea to live among strangers, and not\nknown where her boy was for years, I'm not a bit sure that she'd have\ndone better than Mrs. Pryor.  Yes, she would too; come to think it\nout--she'd have kept on believing the Lord had something to do with it,\nand that He'd fix it some way; and I know she and father would have\nheld hands no matter what happened or where they went.\n\nI guess the biggest thing the matter with Pryors was that they didn't\nknow how to go about loving each other right; maybe it was because they\ndidn't love God, so they couldn't know exactly what PROPER LOVE was;\nbecause God is love, like father said.\n\nMrs. Pryor didn't want to see Mr. Pryor--I can't get used to calling\nthem Paget--and she didn't ask anything about him.  I guess she was\npretty mad at him.  She never had liked the Emmet cousin, and she'd had\nnothing but trouble with him all the time he had been in her family,\nand then that awful disgrace, that she always THOUGHT was all him, but\nshe couldn't prove it, and she had no money.\n\nThat's a very bad thing.  A woman should always have some money.  She\nworks as hard as any one, and usually she has more that worries her, so\nit's only fair for her to have part of what the work and worry bring.\nMother always has money.  Why, she has so much, she can help father out\nwhen he is pushed with bills, as she did last fall, to start Shelley to\nmusic school.  It's no way to be forced to live with a man, just to get\na home, food, and clothing.  I don't believe mother ever would do it in\nall this world.  But then mother has worked all her life, and so if\nfather doesn't do as she wants him to, she'd know exactly how to go\nabout taking care of herself.\n\nAfter all Mrs. Pryor didn't need to sit back on her dignity and look so\nabused.  He couldn't knock her down, and drag her clear here.  Why\ndidn't she say right out, in the beginning, that her son COULDN'T be a\nthief, that she knew it, and she'd stay at home and wait for him to\ncome back?  She could have put a piece in the paper saying she knew her\nboy was all right, and for him to come back, so they could go to work\nand PROVE it.  I bet if she'd had one tenth of the ginger mother has,\nshe'd have stopped the whole fuss in the start.  I looked at her almost\nsteadily, trying to figure out just what mother would have done in her\nplace.  Maybe I'm mistaken about exactly how she would have set to\nwork, but this I KNOW: she'd have stuck to the Lord; she'd have loved\nfather, so dearly, he just COULDN'T have wanted her to do things that\nhurt her until it gave her heart trouble; and she never, never would\nhave given up one of us, and sat holding her heart for months, refusing\nto see or to speak to any one, while she waited for some one else to do\nsomething.  Mother never waits.  She always thinks a minute, if she's\nin doubt she asks father; if he can't decide, both of them ask God; and\nthen you ought to see things begin to fly.\n\nThe more I watched Mrs. Pryor, the more I began to think she was a\nlady; and just about when I was sure that was what ailed her, I heard\nfather say:  \"Perhaps the lady would like a cup of tea.\"  I had a big\nnotion to tell her to come on, and I would show her where the cannister\nwas, but I thought I better not.  I wanted to, though.  She'd have felt\nmuch better if she had got up and worked like the rest of us.  With all\nthe excitement, and everything happening at once, you'd have thought\nmother would be flat on her back, but flat nothing!  Everything was\npicked up and slid back, fast as it was torn down; she found time to\nflannel her nose and brush her hair, her collar was straight, and the\ngoldstone pin shone in the light, while her starched white apron\nfluttered as she went through the doors.  She said a few words to\nCandace and Mrs. Freshett, May took out a linen cloth and began to set\nplaces for all the grown people, so I knew there'd be strawberry\npreserves and fried ham, but in all that, would you ever have thought\nthat she'd find a second to make biscuit, and tea cakes herself?  Plain\nas preaching I heard her say to Mrs. Freshett:  \"I do hope and pray\nthat Mr. Pryor will come out of it right, so we can take him home, and\nteach him to behave himself; but if he's gone this minute, I intend to\nhave another decent meal for Shelley to offer her young man; and I\ndon't care if I show Mrs. Pryor that we're not hungry over here, if we\ndo lack servants to carry in food on silver platters.\"\n\n\"That I jest would!\" said Mrs. Freshett.  \"Even if he turns up his\ntoes, 'tain't YOUR funeral, thank the Lord! an' looky here, I'd jest as\nsoon set things in a bake pan an' pass 'em for you, myself.  I'll do\nit, if you say the word.\"\n\nMother bit her lip, and fought her face to keep it straight, as she\nsaid confidential-like:  \"No, I'm not going to toady to her.  I only\nwant her to see that a meal really consists of food after all; I don't\nmind putting my best foot foremost, but I won't ape her.\"\n\n\"Huccome they to fuss like this, peaceable as Mr. Stanton be, an'\nwhat's Shelley's beau to them?\"\n\n\"I should think you could tell by looking at Pryors,\" said mother.\n\"He's their mystery, and also their son.  Shelley met him in Chicago,\nhe came here to see her, and ran right into them.  I'll tell you about\nit before you go.  Now, I must keep these applications hot, for I've\nset my head on pulling Mr. Pryor out so that he can speak, and have a\nfew decent years of life yet.\"\n\n\"But why did the old devil--EX-cuse me, I mean the old GENTLEMAN, want\nto shoot your man?\"\n\n\"He didn't!  I'll tell you all about it after they're gone.\"\n\n\"I bet you don't get shet of them the night,\" said Mrs. Freshett.\n\n\"All right!\" said mother.  \"Whatever Dr. Fenner thinks.  I won't have\nMr. Pryor moved until it can't hurt him, if he stays a week.  I blame\nher quite as much as I do him; from what I know.  If a woman is going\nto live with a man, there are times when she's got to put her foot\ndown--flat--most unmercifully flat!\"\n\n\"Ain't she though!\" said Mrs. Freshett; then she and mother just\nlaughed.\n\nThere!  What did I tell you?  I feel as good as if father had patted me\non the head and bragged on me a lot.  I THOUGHT mother wouldn't think\nthat Mr. Pryor was ALL to blame, and she didn't.  I figured that out by\nmyself, too.\n\nEvery minute Mr. Pryor grew better.  He breathed easier, and mother\ntilted on her toes and waved her hands, when he moved his feet, threw\nback his head, lifted his hand to it, and acted like he was almost over\nit, and still in shape to manage himself.  She hurried to tell Mrs.\nPryor, and I know mother didn't like it when she never even said she\nwas glad, or went to see for herself.\n\nLaddie and the Princess watched him, while every one else went to\nsupper.  Laddie picked up Mrs. Pryor's chair, carried her to the\ndining-room, and set her in my place beside father.  He placed Dr.\nFenner next her, and left Robert to sit with Shelley.  I don't think\nMrs. Pryor quite liked that, but no one asked her.\n\nI watched and listened until everything seemed to be going right there,\nand then I slipped into the parlour, where Laddie and the Princess were\ncaring for Mr. Pryor.  With one hand Laddie held hers, the other\ngrasped Mr. Pryor's wrist.  Laddie never took his eyes from that white,\ndrawn face, except to smile at her, and squeeze her hand every little\nwhile.  At last Mr. Pryor turned over and sighed, pretty soon he opened\nhis eyes, and looked at Laddie, then at the Princess, and it was\nnothing new to see them, so he smiled and dozed again.  After a while\nhe opened them wider, then he saw the piano--that was an eye-opener for\nany one--and the strange room, so he asked, most as plain as he ever\ntalked, why he was at our house again, and then he began to remember.\nHe struggled to sit up and the colour came into his face.  So Laddie\nlet go the Princess, and held him down while he said:  \"Mr. Pryor,\nanswer me this.  Do you want to spend the remainder of your life in an\ninvalid's chair, or would you like to walk abroad and sit a horse\nagain?\"\n\nHe glared at Laddie, but he heard how things were plainly enough.\n\nLaddie held him, while he explained what a fight we had to unlock his\nmuscles, and start him going again, and how, if we hadn't loved him,\nand wanted him so, and had left him untouched until the Doctor came,\nvery likely he'd have been paralyzed all the rest of his life, if he\nhadn't died; and he said he wished he HAD, and he didn't THANK any one\nfor saving him.\n\n\"Oh yes you do!\" said Laddie, the same as he'd have talked to Leon.\n\"You can't stuff me on that, and you needn't try.  Being dead is a\ncold, clammy proposition, that all of us put off as long as we can.\nYou know you want to see Pamela in her own home.  You know you are\ninterested in how I come out with those horses.  You know you want the\nlittle people you spoke of, around you.  You know the pain and suspense\nyou have borne have almost driven you insane, and it was because you\ncared so deeply.  Now lie still, and keep quiet!  All of us are tired\nand there's no sense in making us go through this again, besides the\nrisk of crippling yourself that you run.  Right here in this house are\nthe papers to prove that your nephew took your money, and hid it in\nyour son's clothing, as he already had done a hundred lesser things,\nbefore, purposely to estrange you.  Hold steady!  You must hear this!\nThe sooner you know it, the better you'll feel.  You remember, don't\nyou, that before your nephew entered your home, you idolized your son.\nYou thought the things he did were amusing.  A boy is a boy, and if\nhe's alive, he's very apt to be lively.  Mother could tell you a few\npranks that Leon has put us through; but they're only a boy's\nfoolishness, they are not unusual or unforgivable.  I've gone over the\nevidence your son brings, with extreme care, so has father.  Both of us\nare quite familiar with common law.  He has every proof you can\npossibly desire.  You can't get around it, even if your heart wasn't\nworn out with rebellion, and you were not crazy to have the loving\nsympathy of your family again.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it!\"\n\n\"You have got to!  I tell you it is PROOF, man!  The documents are in\nthis house now.\"\n\n\"He forged them, or stole them, as he took the money!\"\n\nLaddie just laughed.\n\n\"How you do long, and fight, to be convinced!\" he said.  \"I don't blame\nyou!  When anything means this much, of course you must be sure.  But\nyou'll know your nephew's signature; also your lawyer's.  You'll know\nletters from old friends who are above question.  Sandy McSheel has\nwritten you that he was with Robert through all of it, and he gives you\nhis word that everything is all right.  You will believe him, won't\nyou?\"\n\nBig tears began to squeeze from under Mr. Pryor's lids, until Laddie\nand the Princess each tried to see how much of him they could hold to\nkeep him together-like.\n\n\"Tell me!\" he said at last, so they took turns explaining everything\nplain as day, and soon he listened without being held.\n\nWhen they had told him everything they could think of, he asked: \"Did\nRobert kill Emmet?\"\n\n\"I am very happy to be able to tell you that he did not.  It would have\nbeen painful, and not helped a bad matter a particle.  Your nephew had\ndissipated until he was only a skeleton just breathing his last.  It's\nprobable that his fear of death helped your son out, so that he got the\nevidence he wanted easier than he hoped to in the beginning.  I don't\nmean that he is dead now; but he is passing slowly, and loathsomely.\nRobert thinks word that he has gone will come any hour.  Think how\npleasant it will be to have your son!  Think how happy your home will\nbe now!  Think how you will love to see Sandy, and all your old\nfriends!  Think how glad you'll be to go home, and take charge of your\nestate!\"\n\n\"Think!\" cried Mr. Pryor, pushing Laddie away and sitting up: \"Think\nhow I shall enjoy wringing the last drop of blood from that craven's\nbody with these old hands!\"\n\nWhat a sight he did look to be sure!  Sick, half-crazy, on the very\nverge of the grave himself, and wanting to kill a poor man already\ndying.  Aren't some people too curious?\n\nLaddie carefully laid him down, straightened him out and held him\nagain.  Mother always said he was \"patient as Job,\" and that day it\nproved to be a good thing.\n\n\"You're determined to keep yourself well supplied with trouble,\"\nlaughed Laddie.  I don't believe any one else would have dared.  \"Now\nto an unbiased observer, it would seem that you'd be ready to let well\nenough alone.  You have your son back, you have him fully exonerated,\nyou have much of your property, you are now ready for freedom, life,\nand love, with the best of us; you have also two weddings on your hands\nin the near future.  Why in the name of sense are you anxious for more?\"\n\n\"I should have thought that Sandy McSheel, if he's a real friend of\nmine----\"\n\n\"Sandy tells you all about it in the letter he has sent.  He went with\nRobert fully intending to do that very thing for you, but the poor\ncreature was too loathsome.  The sight of him made Sandy sick.  He\nwrites you that when he saw the horrible spectacle, all he could think\nof was to secure the evidence needed and get away.\"\n\nSuddenly the Princess arose and knelt beside the davenport.  She put\nher arms around her father's neck and drew his wrinkled, white old face\nup against her lovely one.\n\n\"Daddy!  Dear old Daddy!\" she cried.  \"I've had such a hard spot in my\nheart against you for so long.  Oh do let's forget everything, and\nbegin all over again; begin away back where we were before Emmet ever\ncame.  Oh Daddy, do let's forget, and begin all over new, like other\npeople!\"\n\nHe held her tight a minute, then his lips began whispering against her\near.  Finally he said:  \"Take yourselves off, and send Robert here.  I\nwant my son.  Oh I want my boy!\"\n\nIt was a long time before Robert came from the parlour; when he did, it\nwas only to get his mother and take her back with him; then it was a\nstill longer time before the door opened; but when it did, it was\nperfectly sure that they were all friends again.  Then Leon went to\ntell Thomas, and he came with the big carriage.\n\nWhite and shaking, Mr. Pryor was lifted into it and they went home\ntogether, taking Shelley with them to stay that night; so no doubt she\nwas proposed to and got her kiss before she slept.\n\nThat fall there were two weddings at our church at the same time.\n\nSally's had been fine; but it wasn't worth mentioning beside Laddie and\nthe Princess, and Robert and Shelley.  You should have seen my mother!\nShe rocked like a kingbird on the top twig of the winesap, which was\nthe tallest tree in our orchard, and for once there wasn't a single fly\nin her ointment, not one, she said so herself, and so did father.  As\nwe watched the big ve-hi-ackle, as Leon called it, creep slowly down\nthe Little Hill, it made me think of that pathetic poem, \"The Three\nWarnings,\" in McGuffey's Sixth.  I guess I gave Mr. Pryor the first,\nthat time he got so angry he hit his horse until it almost ran away.\nMother delivered the second when she curry-combed him about the taxes,\nand Mrs. Freshett finished the job.  The last two lines read as if they\nhad been especially written about him:\n\n  \"And now old Dodson, turning pale,\n  Yields to his fate--so ends my tale.\"",
