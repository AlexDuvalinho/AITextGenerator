STRONGITHARM'S REPORT\n\n\n\n\nBEAUTY AND THE BEAST.\n\nA STORY OF OLD RUSSIA.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nWe are about to relate a story of mingled fact and fancy. The facts are\nborrowed from the Russian author, Petjerski; the fancy is our own. Our\ntask will chiefly be to soften the outlines of incidents almost too\nsharp and rugged for literary use, to supply them with the necessary\ncoloring and sentiment, and to give a coherent and proportioned shape\nto the irregular fragments of an old chronicle. We know something, from\nother sources, of the customs described, something of the character of\nthe people from personal observation, and may therefore the more freely\ntake such liberties as we choose with the rude, vigorous sketches of the\nRussian original. One who happens to have read the work of Villebois can\neasily comprehend the existence of a state of society, on the banks of\nthe Volga, a hundred years ago, which is now impossible, and will soon\nbecome incredible. What is strangest in our narrative has been declared\nto be true.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nWe are in Kinesma, a small town on the Volga, between Kostroma and\nNijni-Novgorod. The time is about the middle of the last century, and\nthe month October.\n\nThere was trouble one day, in the palace of Prince Alexis, of Kinesma.\nThis edifice, with its massive white walls, and its pyramidal roofs of\ngreen copper, stood upon a gentle mound to the eastward of the town,\noverlooking it, a broad stretch of the Volga, and the opposite shore. On\na similar hill, to the westward, stood the church, glittering with\nits dozen bulging, golden domes. These two establishments divided the\nsovereignty of Kinesma between them.\n\nPrince Alexis owned the bodies of the inhabitants, (with the exception\nof a few merchants and tradesmen,) and the Archimandrite Sergius owned\ntheir souls. But the shadow of the former stretched also over other\nvillages, far beyond the ring of the wooded horizon. The number of his\nserfs was ten thousand, and his rule over them was even less disputed\nthan theirs over their domestic animals.\n\nThe inhabitants of the place had noticed with dismay that the\nslumber-flag had not been hoisted on the castle, although it was half an\nhour after the usual time. So rare a circumstance betokened sudden wrath\nor disaster, on the part of Prince Alexis. Long experience had prepared\nthe people for anything that might happen, and they were consequently\nnot astonished at the singular event which presently transpired.\n\nThe fact is, that in the first place, the dinner had been prolonged full\nten minutes beyond its accustomed limit, owing to a discussion between\nthe Prince, his wife, the Princess Martha, and their son Prince Boris.\nThe last was to leave for St. Petersburg in a fortnight, and wished to\nhave his departure preceded by a festival at the castle. The Princess\nMartha was always ready to second the desires of her only child. Between\nthe two they had pressed some twenty or thirty thousand rubles out\nof the old Prince, for the winter diversions of the young one. The\nfestival, to be sure, would have been a slight expenditure for a noble\nof such immense wealth as Prince Alexis; but he never liked his wife,\nand he took a stubborn pleasure in thwarting her wishes. It was no\nsatisfaction that Boris resembled her in character. That weak successor\nto the sovereignty of Kinesma preferred a game of cards to a bear hunt,\nand could never drink more than a quart of vodki without becoming dizzy\nand sick.\n\n“Ugh!” Prince Alexis would cry, with a shudder of disgust, “the whelp\nbarks after the dam!”\n\nA state dinner he might give; but a festival, with dances, dramatic\nrepresentations, burning tar-barrels, and cannon,--no! He knitted\nhis heavy brows and drank deeply, and his fiery gray eyes shot such\nincessant glances from side to side that Boris and the Princess Martha\ncould not exchange a single wink of silent advice. The pet bear, Mishka,\nplied with strong wines, which Prince Alexis poured out for him into\na golden basin, became at last comically drunk, and in endeavoring to\nexecute a dance, lost his balance, and fell at full length on his back.\n\nThe Prince burst into a yelling, shrieking fit of laughter. Instantly\nthe yellow-haired serfs in waiting, the Calmucks at the hall-door, and\nthe half-witted dwarf who crawled around the table in his tow shirt,\nbegan laughing in chorus, as violently as they could. The Princess\nMartha and Prince Boris laughed also; and while the old man's eyes were\ndimmed with streaming tears of mirth, quickly exchanged nods. The sound\nextended all over the castle, and was heard outside of the walls.\n\n“Father!” said Boris, “let us have the festival, and Mishka shall\nperform again. Prince Paul of Kostroma would strangle, if he could see\nhim.”\n\n“Good, by St. Vladimir!” exclaimed Prince Alexis. “Thou shalt have\nit, my Borka! [1] Where's Simon Petrovitch? May the Devil scorch that\nvagabond, if he doesn't do better than the last time! Sasha!”\n\nA broad-shouldered serf stepped forward and stood with bowed head.\n\n“Lock up Simon Petrovitch in the southwestern tower. Send the tailor and\nthe girls to him, to learn their parts. Search every one of them\nbefore they go in, and if any one dares to carry vodki to the beast,\ntwenty-five lashes on the back!”\n\n\nSasha bowed again and departed. Simon Petrovitch was the court-poet of\nKinesma. He had a mechanical knack of preparing allegorical diversions\nwhich suited the conventional taste of society at that time; but he had\nalso a failing,--he was rarely sober enough to write. Prince Alexis,\ntherefore, was in the habit of locking him up and placing a guard over\nhim, until the inspiration had done its work. The most comely young\nserfs of both sexes were selected to perform the parts, and the\ncourt-tailor arranged for them the appropriate dresses. It depended very\nmuch upon accident--that is to say, the mood of Prince Alexis--whether\nSimon Petrovitch was rewarded with stripes or rubles.\n\nThe matter thus settled, the Prince rose from the table and walked out\nupon an overhanging balcony, where an immense reclining arm-chair of\nstuffed leather was ready for his siesta. He preferred this indulgence\nin the open air; and although the weather was rapidly growing cold,\na pelisse of sables enabled him to slumber sweetly in the face of the\nnorth wind. An attendant stood with the pelisse outspread; another held\nthe halyards to which was attached the great red slumber-flag, ready to\nrun it up and announce to all Kinesma that the noises of the town must\ncease; a few seconds more, and all things would have been fixed in their\nregular daily courses. The Prince, in fact, was just straightening his\nshoulders to receive the sables; his eyelids were dropping, and his\neyes, sinking mechanically with them, fell upon the river-road, at the\nfoot of the hill. Along this road walked a man, wearing the long cloth\ncaftan of a merchant.\n\nPrince Alexis started, and all slumber vanished out of his eyes. He\nleaned forward for a moment, with a quick, eager expression; then a loud\nroar, like that of an enraged wild beast, burst from his mouth. He gave\na stamp that shook the balcony.\n\n“Dog!” he cried to the trembling attendant, “my cap! my whip!”\n\nThe sables fell upon the floor, the cap and whip appeared in a\ntwinkling, and the red slumber-flag was folded up again for the first\ntime in several years, as the Prince stormed out of the castle. The\ntraveller below had heard the cry,--for it might have been heard half a\nmile. He seemed to have a presentiment of evil, for he had already set\noff towards the town at full speed.\n\nTo explain the occurrence, we must mention one of the Prince's many\npeculiar habits. This was, to invite strangers or merchants of the\nneighborhood to dine with him, and, after regaling them bountifully, to\ntake his pay in subjecting them to all sorts of outrageous tricks, with\nthe help of his band of willing domestics. Now this particular merchant\nhad been invited, and had attended; but, being a very wide-awake, shrewd\nperson, he saw what was coming, and dexterously slipped away from\nthe banquet without being perceived. The Prince vowed vengeance, on\ndiscovering the escape, and he was not a man to forget his word.\n\nImpelled by such opposite passions, both parties ran with astonishing\nspeed. The merchant was the taller, but his long caftan, hastily\nungirdled, swung behind him and dragged in the air.\n\nThe short, booted legs of the Prince beat quicker time, and he grasped\nhis short, heavy, leathern whip more tightly as he saw the space\ndiminishing. They dashed into the town of Kinesma a hundred yards apart.\nThe merchant entered the main street, or bazaar, looking rapidly to\nright and left, as he ran, in the hope of espying some place of refuge.\nThe terrible voice behind him cried,--\n\n“Stop, scoundrel! I have a crow to pick with you!”\n\nAnd the tradesmen in their shops looked on and laughed, as well they\nmight, being unconcerned spectators of the fun. The fugitive, therefore,\nkept straight on, notwithstanding a pond of water glittered across the\nfarther end of the street.\n\nAlthough Prince Alexis had gained considerably in the race, such\nviolent exercise, after a heavy dinner, deprived him of breath. He again\ncried,--\n\n“Stop!”\n\n“But the merchant answered,--\n\n“No, Highness! You may come to me, but I will not go to you.”\n\n“Oh, the villian!” growled the Prince, in a hoarse whisper, for he had\nno more voice.\n\nThe pond cut of all further pursuit. Hastily kicking off his loose\nboots, the merchant plunged into the water, rather than encounter\nthe princely whip, which already began to crack and snap in fierce\nanticipation. Prince Alexis kicked off his boots and followed; the pond\ngradually deepened, and in a minute the tall merchant stood up to\nhis chin in the icy water, and his short pursuer likewise but out of\nstriking distance. The latter coaxed and entreated, but the victim kept\nhis ground.\n\n“You lie, Highness!” he said, boldly. “If you want me, come to me.”\n\n“Ah-h-h!” roared the Prince, with chattering teeth, “what a stubborn\nrascal you are! Come here, and I give you my word that I will not hurt\nyou. Nay,”--seeing that the man did not move,--“you shall dine with me\nas often as you please. You shall be my friend; by St. Vladimir, I like\nyou!”\n\n“Make the sign of the cross, and swear it by all the Saints,” said the\nmerchant, composedly.\n\nWith a grim smile on his face, the Prince stepped back and shiveringly\nobeyed. Both then waded out, sat down upon the ground and pulled on\ntheir boots; and presently the people of Kinesma beheld the dripping\npair walking side by side up the street, conversing in the most cordial\nmanner. The merchant dried his clothes FROM WITHIN, at the castle table;\na fresh keg of old Cognac was opened; and although the slumber-flag was\nnot unfurled that afternoon, it flew from the staff and hushed the town\nnearly all the next day.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe festival granted on behalf of Prince Boris was one of the grandest\never given at the castle. In character it was a singular cross between\nthe old Muscovite revel and the French entertainments which were then\nintroduced by the Empress Elizabeth.\n\nAll the nobility, for fifty versts around, including Prince Paul and the\nchief families of Kostroma, were invited. Simon Petrovitch had been so\ncarefully guarded that his work was actually completed and the parts\ndistributed; his superintendence of the performance, however, was still\na matter of doubt, as it was necessary to release him from the tower,\nand after several days of forced abstinence he always manifested a\nraging appetite. Prince Alexis, in spite of this doubt, had been assured\nby Boris that the dramatic part of the entertainment would not be a\nfailure. When he questioned Sasha, the poet's strong-shouldered guard,\nthe latter winked familiarly and answered with a proverb,--\n\n“I sit on the shore and wait for the wind,”--which was as much as to say\nthat Sasha had little fear of the result.\n\nThe tables were spread in the great hall, where places for one hundred\nchosen guests were arranged on the floor, while the three or four\nhundred of minor importance were provided for in the galleries above.\nBy noon the whole party were assembled. The halls and passages of the\ncastle were already permeated with rich and unctuous smells, and a\ndelicate nose might have picked out and arranged, by their finer or\ncoarser vapors, the dishes preparing for the upper and lower tables. One\nof the parasites of Prince Alexis, a dilapidated nobleman, officiated\nas Grand Marshal,--an office which more than compensated for the\nsavage charity he received, for it was performed in continual fear and\ntrembling. The Prince had felt the stick of the Great Peter upon his own\nback, and was ready enough to imitate any custom of the famous monarch.\n\nAn orchestra, composed principally of horns and brass instruments,\noccupied a separate gallery at one end of the dining-hall. The guests\nwere assembled in the adjoining apartments, according to their rank; and\nwhen the first loud blast of the instruments announced the beginning of\nthe banquet, two very differently attired and freighted processions of\nservants made their appearance at the same time. Those intended for the\nprincely table numbered two hundred,--two for each guest. They were\nthe handsomest young men among the ten thousand serfs, clothed in loose\nwhite trousers and shirts of pink or lilac silk; their soft golden\nhair, parted in the middle, fell upon their shoulders, and a band of\ngold-thread about the brow prevented it from sweeping the dishes\nthey carried. They entered the reception-room, bearing huge trays of\nsculptured silver, upon which were anchovies, the finest Finnish caviar,\nsliced oranges, cheese, and crystal flagons of Cognac, rum, and kummel.\nThere were fewer servants for the remaining guests, who were gathered\nin a separate chamber, and regaled with the common black caviar, onions,\nbread, and vodki. At the second blast of trumpets, the two companies set\nthemselves in motion and entered the dining-hall at opposite ends. Our\nbusiness, however, is only with the principal personages, so we will\nallow the common crowd quietly to mount to the galleries and satisfy\ntheir senses with the coarser viands, while their imagination is\nstimulated by the sight of the splendor and luxury below.\n\nPrince Alexis entered first, with a pompous, mincing gait, leading the\nPrincess Martha by the tips of her fingers. He wore a caftan of green\nvelvet laced with gold, a huge vest of crimson brocade, and breeches\nof yellow satin. A wig, resembling clouds boiling in the confluence of\nopposing winds, surged from his low, broad forehead, and flowed upon\nhis shoulders. As his small, fiery eyes swept the hall, every servant\ntrembled: he was as severe at the commencement as he was reckless at\nthe close of a banquet. The Princess Martha wore a robe of pink\nsatin embroidered with flowers made of small pearls, and a train and\nhead-dress of crimson velvet.\n\nHer emeralds were the finest outside of Moscow, and she wore them all.\nHer pale, weak, frightened face was quenched in the dazzle of the green\nfires which shot from her forehead, ears, and bosom, as she moved.\n\nPrince Paul of Kostroma and the Princess Nadejda followed; but on\nreaching the table, the gentlemen took their seats at the head, while\nthe ladies marched down to the foot. Their seats were determined\nby their relative rank, and woe to him who was so ignorant or so\nabsent-minded as to make a mistake! The servants had been carefully\ntrained in advance by the Grand Marshal; and whoever took a place above\nhis rank or importance found, when he came to sit down, that his chair\nhad miraculously disappeared, or, not noticing the fact, seated himself\nabsurdly and violently upon the floor. The Prince at the head of the\ntable, and the Princess at the foot, with their nearest guests of equal\nrank, ate from dishes of massive gold; the others from silver. As soon\nas the last of the company had entered the hall, a crowd of jugglers,\ntumblers, dwarfs, and Calmucks followed, crowding themselves into the\ncorners under the galleries, where they awaited the conclusion of the\nbanquet to display their tricks, and scolded and pummelled each other in\nthe mean time.\n\nOn one side of Prince Alexis the bear Mishka took his station. By order\nof Prince Boris he had been kept from wine for several days, and his\nsmall eyes were keener and hungrier than usual. As he rose now and then,\nimpatiently, and sat upon his hind legs, he formed a curious contrast to\nthe Prince's other supporter, the idiot, who sat also in his tow-shirt,\nwith a large pewter basin in his hand. It was difficult to say whether\nthe beast was most man or the man most beast. They eyed each other and\nwatched the motions of their lord with equal jealousy; and the dismal\nwhine of the bear found an echo in the drawling, slavering laugh of\nthe idiot. The Prince glanced form one to the other; they put him in a\ncapital humor, which was not lessened as he perceived an expression of\nenvy pass over the face of Prince Paul.\n\nThe dinner commenced with a botvinia--something between a soup and a\nsalad--of wonderful composition. It contained cucumbers, cherries, salt\nfish, melons, bread, salt, pepper, and wine. While it was being served,\nfour huge fishermen, dressed to represent mermen of the Volga, naked to\nthe waist, with hair crowned with reeds, legs finned with silver tissue\nfrom the knees downward, and preposterous scaly tails, which dragged\nhelplessly upon the floor, entered the hall, bearing a broad, shallow\ntank of silver. In the tank flapped and swam four superb sterlets, their\nridgy backs rising out of the water like those of alligators. Great\napplause welcomed this new and classical adaptation of the old custom\nof showing the LIVING fish, before cooking them, to the guests at the\ntable. The invention was due to Simon Petrovitch, and was (if the truth\nmust be confessed) the result of certain carefully measured supplies of\nbrandy which Prince Boris himself had carried to the imprisoned poet.\n\nAfter the sterlets had melted away to their backbones, and the roasted\ngeese had shrunk into drumsticks and breastplates, and here and there a\nguest's ears began to redden with more rapid blood, Prince Alexis judged\nthat the time for diversion had arrived. He first filled up the idiot's\nbasin with fragments of all the dishes within his reach,--fish, stewed\nfruits, goose fat, bread, boiled cabbage, and beer,--the idiot grinning\nwith delight all the while, and singing, “Ne uyesjai golubchik moi,”\n (Don't go away, my little pigeon), between the handfuls which he crammed\ninto his mouth. The guests roared with laughter, especially when a\njuggler or Calmuck stole out from under the gallery, and pretended to\nhave designs upon the basin. Mishka, the bear, had also been well fed,\nand greedily drank ripe old Malaga from the golden dish. But, alas! he\nwould not dance. Sitting up on his hind legs, with his fore paws hanging\nbefore him, he cast a drunken, languishing eye upon the company, lolled\nout his tongue, and whined with an almost human voice. The domestics,\nsecretly incited by the Grand Marshal, exhausted their ingenuity in\ncoaxing him, but in vain. Finally, one of them took a goblet of wine in\none hand, and, embracing Mishka with the other, began to waltz. The\nbear stretched out his paw and clumsily followed the movements, whirling\nround and round after the enticing goblet. The orchestra struck up, and\nthe spectacle, though not exactly what Prince Alexis wished, was comical\nenough to divert the company immensely.\n\nBut the close of the performance was not upon the programme. The\nimpatient bear, getting no nearer his goblet, hugged the man violently\nwith the other paw, striking his claws through the thin shirt. The\ndance-measure was lost; the legs of the two tangled, and they fell to\nthe floor, the bear undermost. With a growl of rage and disappointment,\nhe brought his teeth together through the man's arm, and it might have\nfared badly with the latter, had not the goblet been refilled by some\none and held to the animal's nose.\n\nThen, releasing his hold, he sat up again, drank another bottle, and\nstaggered out of the hall.\n\nNow the health of Prince Alexis was drunk,--by the guests on the floor\nof the hall in Champagne, by those in the galleries in kislischi and\nhydromel. The orchestra played; a choir of serfs sang an ode by Simon\nPetrovitch, in which the departure of Prince Boris was mentioned; the\ntumblers began to posture; the jugglers came forth and played their\ntricks; and the cannon on the ramparts announced to all Kinesma, and far\nup and down the Volga, that the company were rising from the table.\n\nHalf an hour later, the great red slumber-flag floated over the castle.\nAll slept,--except the serf with the wounded arm, the nervous Grand\nMarshal, and Simon Petrovich with his band of dramatists, guarded by the\nindefatigable Sasha. All others slept,--and the curious crowd outside,\nlistening to the music, stole silently away; down in Kinesma, the\nmothers ceased to scold their children, and the merchants whispered to\neach other in the bazaar; the captains of vessels floating on the Volga\ndirected their men by gestures; the mechanics laid aside hammer and axe,\nand lighted their pipes. Great silence fell upon the land, and continued\nunbroken so long as Prince Alexis and his guests slept the sleep of the\njust and the tipsy.\n\nBy night, however, they were all awake and busily preparing for the\ndiversions of the evening. The ball-room was illuminated by thousands of\nwax-lights, so connected with inflammable threads, that the wicks could\nall be kindled in a moment. A pyramid of tar-barrels had been erected\non each side of the castle-gate, and every hill or mound on the opposite\nbank of the Volga was similarly crowned. When, to a stately march,--the\nmusicians blowing their loudest,--Prince Alexis and Princess Martha led\nthe way to the ball-room, the signal was given: candles and tar-barrels\nburst into flame, and not only within the castle, but over the landscape\nfor five or six versts, around everything was bright and clear in the\nfiery day. Then the noises of Kinesma were not only permitted, but\nencouraged. Mead and qvass flowed in the very streets, and the castle\ntrumpets could not be heard for the sound of troikas and balalaikas.\n\nAfter the Polonaise, and a few stately minuets, (copied from the court\nof Elizabeth), the company were ushered into the theatre. The hour of\nSimon Petrovitch had struck: with the inspiration smuggled to him by\nPrince Boris, he had arranged a performance which he felt to be his\nmasterpiece. Anxiety as to its reception kept him sober. The overture\nhad ceased, the spectators were all in their seats, and now the curtain\nrose. The background was a growth of enormous, sickly toad-stools,\nsupposed to be clouds. On the stage stood a girl of eighteen, (the\nhandsomest in Kinesma), in hoops and satin petticoat, powdered hair,\npatches, and high-heeled shoes. She held a fan in one hand, and a bunch\nof marigolds in the other. After a deep and graceful curtsy to the\ncompany, she came forward and said,--\n\n“I am the goddess Venus. I have come to Olympus to ask some questions of\nJupiter.”\n\nThunder was heard, and a car rolled upon the stage. Jupiter sat therein,\nin a blue coat, yellow vest, ruffled shirt and three-cornered hat. One\nhand held a bunch of thunderbolts, which he occasionally lifted and\nshook; the other, a gold-headed cane.\n\n“Here am, I Jupiter,” said he; “what does Venus desire?”\n\nA poetical dialogue then followed, to the effect that the favorite of\nthe goddess, Prince Alexis of Kinesma, was about sending his son, Prince\nBoris, into the gay world, wherein himself had already displayed all the\ngifts of all the divinities of Olympus. He claimed from her, Venus, like\nfavors for his son: was it possible to grant them? Jupiter dropped his\nhead and meditated. He could not answer the question at once: Apollo,\nthe Graces, and the Muses must be consulted: there were few precedents\nwhere the son had succeeded in rivalling the father,--yet the father's\npious wishes could not be overlooked. Venus said,--\n\n“What I asked for Prince Alexis was for HIS sake: what I ask for the son\nis for the father's sake.”\n\nJupiter shook his thunderbolt and called “Apollo!”\n\nInstantly the stage was covered with explosive and coruscating\nfires,--red, blue, and golden,--and amid smoke, and glare, and fizzing\nnoises, and strong chemical smells, Apollo dropped down from above. He\nwas accustomed to heat and smoke, being the cook's assistant, and was\nsweated down to a weight capable of being supported by the invisible\nwires. He wore a yellow caftan, and wide blue silk trousers. His yellow\nhair was twisted around and glued fast to gilded sticks, which stood out\nfrom his head in a circle, and represented rays of light. He first bowed\nto Prince Alexis, then to the guests, then to Jupiter, then to Venus.\nThe matter was explained to him.\n\nHe promised to do what he could towards favoring the world with a second\ngeneration of the beauty, grace, intellect, and nobility of character\nwhich had already won his regard. He thought, however, that their gifts\nwere unnecessary, since the model was already in existence, and nothing\nmore could be done than to IMITATE it.\n\n(Here there was another meaning bow towards Prince Alexis,--a bow in\nwhich Jupiter and Venus joined. This was the great point of the evening,\nin the opinion of Simon Petrovitch. He peeped through a hole in one\nof the clouds, and, seeing the delight of Prince Alexis and the\ncongratulations of his friends, immediately took a large glass of\nCognac).\n\nThe Graces were then summoned, and after them the Muses--all in hoops,\npowder, and paint. Their songs had the same burden,--intense admiration\nof the father, and good-will for the son, underlaid with a delicate\ndoubt. The close was a chorus of all the deities and semi-deities in\npraise of the old Prince, with the accompaniment of fireworks. Apollo\nrose through the air like a frog, with his blue legs and yellow arms\nwide apart; Jupiter's chariot rolled off; Venus bowed herself back\nagainst a mouldy cloud; and the Muses came forward in a bunch, with a\nwreath of laurel, which they placed upon the venerated head.\n\nSasha was dispatched to bring the poet, that he might receive his\nwell-earned praise and reward. But alas for Simon Petrovitch? His legs\nhad already doubled under him. He was awarded fifty rubles and a new\ncaftan, which he was not in a condition to accept until several days\nafterward.\n\nThe supper which followed resembled the dinner, except that there were\nfewer dishes and more bottles. When the closing course of sweatmeats had\neither been consumed or transferred to the pockets of the guests,\nthe Princess Martha retired with the ladies. The guests of lower rank\nfollowed; and there remained only some fifteen or twenty, who were\nthereupon conducted by Prince Alexis to a smaller chamber, where he\npulled off his coat, lit his pipe, and called for brandy. The others\nfollowed his example, and their revelry wore out the night.\n\nSuch was the festival which preceded the departure of Prince Boris for\nSt. Petersburg.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nBefore following the young Prince and his fortunes, in the capital, we\nmust relate two incidents which somewhat disturbed the ordered course of\nlife in the castle of Kinesma, during the first month or two after his\ndeparture.\n\nIt must be stated, as one favorable trait in the character of Prince\nAlexis, that, however brutally he treated his serfs, he allowed no other\nman to oppress them. All they had and were--their services, bodies,\nlives--belonged to him; hence injustice towards them was disrespect\ntowards their lord. Under the fear which his barbarity inspired lurked a\nbrute-like attachment, kept alive by the recognition of this quality.\n\nOne day it was reported to him that Gregor, a merchant in the bazaar at\nKinesma, had cheated the wife of one of his serfs in the purchase of a\npiece of cloth. Mounting his horse, he rode at once to Gregor's booth,\ncalled for the cloth, and sent the entire piece to the woman, in the\nmerchant's name, as a confessed act of reparation.\n\n“Now, Gregor, my child,” said he, as he turned his horse's head, “have\na care in future, and play me no more dishonest tricks. Do you hear? I\nshall come and take your business in hand myself, if the like happens\nagain.”\n\nNot ten days passed before the like--or something fully as bad--did\nhappen. Gregor must have been a new comer in Kinesma, or he would not\nhave tried the experiment. In an hour from the time it was announced,\nPrince Alexis appeared in the bazaar with a short whip under his arm.\n\nHe dismounted at the booth with an ironical smile on his face, which\nchilled the very marrow in the merchant's bones.\n\n“Ah, Gregor, my child,” he shouted, “you have already forgotten my\ncommands. Holy St. Nicholas, what a bad memory the boy has! Why, he\ncan't be trusted to do business: I must attend to the shop myself. Out\nof the way! march!”\n\nHe swung his terrible whip; and Gregor, with his two assistants, darted\nunder the counter, and made their escape. The Prince then entered the\nbooth, took up a yard-stick, and cried out in a voice which could be\nheard from one end of the town to the other,--“Ladies and gentlemen,\nhave the kindness to come and examine our stock of goods! We have silks\nand satins, and all kinds of ladies' wear; also velvet, cloth, cotton,\nand linen for the gentlemen. Will your Lordships deign to choose? Here\nare stockings and handkerchiefs of the finest. We understand how to\nmeasure, your Lordships, and we sell cheap. We give no change, and take\nno small money. Whoever has no cash may have credit. Every thing sold\nbelow cost, on account of closing up the establishment. Ladies and\ngentlemen, give us a call?”\n\nEverybody in Kinesma flocked to the booth, and for three hours Prince\nAlexis measured and sold, either for scant cash or long credit, until\nthe last article had been disposed of and the shelves were empty. There\nwas great rejoicing in the community over the bargains made that day.\nWhen all was over, Gregor was summoned, and the cash received paid into\nhis hands.\n\n“It won't take you long to count it,” said the Prince; “but here is a\nlist of debts to be collected, which will furnish you with pleasant\noccupation, and enable you to exercise your memory. Would your Worship\ncondescend to take dinner to-day with your humble assistant? He would\nesteem it a favor to be permitted to wait upon you with whatever his\npoor house can supply.”\n\nGregor gave a glance at the whip under the Prince's arm, and begged to\nbe excused. But the latter would take no denial, and carried out the\ncomedy to the end by giving the merchant the place of honor at his\ntable, and dismissing him with the present of a fine pup of his favorite\nbreed. Perhaps the animal acted as a mnemonic symbol, for Gregor was\nnever afterwards accused of forgetfulness.\n\nIf this trick put the Prince in a good humor, some thing presently\noccurred which carried him to the opposite extreme. While taking his\ncustomary siesta one afternoon, a wild young fellow--one of his noble\npoor relations, who “sponged” at the castle--happened to pass along a\ncorridor outside of the very hall where his Highness was snoring. Two\nladies in waiting looked down from an upper window. The young fellow\nperceived them, and made signs to attract their attention. Having\nsucceeded in this, he attempted, by all sorts of antics and grimaces, to\nmake them laugh or speak; but he failed, for the slumber-flag waved\nover them, and its fear was upon them. Then, in a freak of incredible\nrashness, he sang, in a loud voice, the first line of a popular ditty,\nand took to his heels.\n\nNo one had ever before dared to insult the sacred quiet. The Prince was\non his feet in a moment, and rushed into the corridor, (dropping his\nmantle of sables by the way,) shouting.--\n\n“Bring me the wretch who sang!”\n\nThe domestics scattered before him, for his face was terrible to look\nupon. Some of them had heard the voice, indeed, but not one of them\nhad seen the culprit, who al ready lay upon a heap of hay in one of the\nstables, and appeared to be sunk in innocent sleep.\n\n“Who was it? who was it?” yelled the Prince, foaming at the mouth with\nrage, as he rushed from chamber to chamber.\n\nAt last he halted at the top of the great flight of steps leading into\nthe court-yard, and repeated his demand in a voice of thunder.\n\nThe servants, trembling, kept at a safe distance, and some of them\nventured to state that the offender could not be discovered. The Prince\nturned and entered one of the state apartments, whence came the sound\nof porcelain smashed on the floor, and mirrors shivered on the walls.\nWhenever they heard that sound, the immates of the castle knew that a\nhurricane was let loose.\n\nThey deliberated hurriedly and anxiously. What was to be done? In his\nfits of blind animal rage, there was nothing of which the Prince was not\ncapable, and the fit could be allayed only by finding a victim. No one,\nhowever, was willing to be a Curtius for the others, and meanwhile the\nstorm was increasing from minute to minute. Some of the more active\nand shrewd of the household pitched upon the leader of the band, a\nsimple-minded, good-natured serf, named Waska. They entreated him\nto take upon himself the crime of having sung, offering to have his\npunishment mitigated in every possible way. He was proof against their\ntears, but not against the money which they finally offered, in order to\navert the storm. The agreement was made, although Waska both scratched\nhis head and shook it, as he reflected upon the probable result.\n\nThe Prince, after his work of destruction, again appeared upon the\nsteps, and with hoarse voice and flashing eyes, began to announce that\nevery soul in the castle should receive a hundred lashes, when a noise\nwas heard in the court, and amid cries of “Here he is!” “We've got him,\nHighness!” the poor Waska, bound hand and foot, was brought forward.\nThey placed him at the bottom of the steps. The Prince descended until\nthe two stood face to face. The others looked on from courtyard, door,\nand window. A pause ensued, during which no one dared to breathe.\n\nAt last Prince Alexis spoke, in a loud and terrible voice--\n\n“It was you who sang it?”\n\n“Yes, your Highness, it was I,” Waska replied, in a scarcely audible\ntone, dropping his head and mechanically drawing his shoulders together,\nas if shrinking from the coming blow.\n\nIt was full three minutes before the Prince again spoke. He still held\nthe whip in his hand, his eyes fixed and the muscles of his face rigid.\nAll at once the spell seemed to dissolve: his hand fell, and he said in\nhis ordinary voice--\n\n“You sing remarkably well. Go, now: you shall have ten rubles and an\nembroidered caftan for your singing.”\n\nBut any one would have made a great mistake who dared to awaken Prince\nAlexis a second time in the same manner.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nPrince Boris, in St. Petersburg, adopted the usual habits of his class.\nHe dressed elegantly; he drove a dashing troika; he played, and lost\nmore frequently than he won; he took no special pains to shun any\nform of fashionable dissipation. His money went fast, it is true; but\ntwenty-five thousand rubles was a large sum in those days, and Boris did\nnot inherit his father's expensive constitution. He was presented to the\nEmpress; but his thin face, and mild, melancholy eyes did not make much\nimpression upon that ponderous woman. He frequented the salons of\nthe nobility, but saw no face so beautiful as that of Parashka, the\nserf-maiden who personated Venus for Simon Petrovitch. The fact is, he\nhad a dim, undeveloped instinct of culture, and a crude, half-conscious\nworship of beauty,--both of which qualities found just enough\nnourishment in the life of the capital to tantalize and never satisfy\nhis nature. He was excited by his new experience, but hardly happier.\n\nAlthough but three-and-twenty, he would never know the rich, vital glow\nwith which youth rushes to clasp all forms of sensation.\n\nHe had seen, almost daily, in his father's castle, excess in its most\nexcessive development. It had grown to be repulsive, and he knew not\nhow to fill the void in his life. With a single spark of genius, and a\nlittle more culture, he might have become a passable author or artist;\nbut he was doomed to be one of those deaf and dumb natures that see the\nmovements of the lips of others, yet have no conception of sound. No\nwonder his savage old father looked upon him with contempt, for even his\nvices were without strength or character.\n\nThe dark winter days passed by, one by one, and the first week of Lent\nhad already arrived to subdue the glittering festivities of the court,\nwhen the only genuine adventure of the season happened to the young\nPrince. For adventures, in the conventional sense of the word, he was\nnot distinguished; whatever came to him must come by its own force, or\nthe force of destiny.\n\nOne raw, gloomy evening, as dusk was setting in, he saw a female figure\nin a droschky, which was about turning from the great Morskoi into the\nGorokhovaya (Pea) Street. He noticed, listlessly, that the lady\nwas dressed in black, closely veiled, and appeared to be urging the\nistvostchik (driver) to make better speed. The latter cut his horse\nsharply: it sprang forward, just at the turning, and the droschky,\nstriking a lamp-post was instantly overturned. The lady, hurled with\ngreat force upon the solidly frozen snow, lay motionless, which the\ndriver observing, he righted the sled and drove off at full speed,\nwithout looking behind him. It was not inhumanity, but fear of the knout\nthat hurried him away.\n\nPrince Boris looked up and down the Morskoi, but perceived no one near\nat hand. He then knelt upon the snow, lifted the lady's head to his\nknee, and threw back her veil. A face so lovely, in spite of its deadly\npallor, he had never before seen. Never had he even imagined so perfect\nan oval, such a sweet, fair forehead, such delicately pencilled brows,\nso fine and straight a nose, such wonderful beauty of mouth and chin. It\nwas fortunate that she was not very severely stunned, for Prince Boris\nwas not only ignorant of the usual modes of restoration in such cases,\nbut he totally forgot their necessity, in his rapt contemplation of\nthe lady's face. Presently she opened her eyes, and they dwelt,\nexpressionless, but bewildering in their darkness and depth, upon his\nown, while her consciousness of things slowly returned.\n\nShe strove to rise, and Boris gently lifted and supported her. She would\nhave withdrawn from his helping arm, but was still too weak from the\nshock. He, also, was confused and (strange to say) embarrassed; but he\nhad self-possession enough to shout, “Davei!” (Here!) at random. The\ncall was answered from the Admiralty Square; a sled dashed up the\nGorokhovaya and halted beside him. Taking the single seat, he lifted her\ngently upon his lap and held her very tenderly in his arms.\n\n“Where?” asked the istvostchik.\n\nBoris was about to answer “Anywhere!” but the lady whispered in a voice\nof silver sweetness, the name of a remote street, near the Smolnoi\nChurch.\n\nAs the Prince wrapped the ends of his sable pelisse about her, he\nnoticed that her furs were of the common foxskin worn by the middle\nclasses. They, with her heavy boots and the threadbare cloth of her\ngarments, by no means justified his first suspicion,--that she was a\ngrande dame, engaged in some romantic “adventure.” She was not more than\nnineteen or twenty years of age, and he felt--without knowing what\nit was--the atmosphere of sweet, womanly purity and innocence which\nsurrounded her. The shyness of a lost boyhood surprised him.\n\nBy the time they had reached the Litenie, she had fully recovered her\nconsciousness and a portion of her strength. She drew away from him as\nmuch as the narrow sled would allow.\n\n“You have been very kind, sir, and I thank you,” she said; “but I am now\nable to go home without your further assistance.”\n\n“By no means, lady!” said the Prince. “The streets are rough, and\nhere are no lamps. If a second accident were to happen, you would be\nhelpless. Will you not allow me to protect you?”\n\nShe looked him in the face. In the dusky light, she saw not the peevish,\nweary features of the worldling, but only the imploring softness of his\neyes, the full and perfect honesty of his present emotion. She made no\nfurther objection; perhaps she was glad that she could trust the elegant\nstranger.\n\nBoris, never before at a loss for words, even in the presence of\nthe Empress, was astonished to find how awkward were his attempts at\nconversation. She was presently the more self-possessed of the two, and\nnothing was ever so sweet to his ears as the few commonplace remarks she\nuttered. In spite of the darkness and the chilly air, the sled seemed to\nfly like lightning. Before he supposed they had made half the way, she\ngave a sign to the istvostchik, and they drew up before a plain house of\nsquared logs.\n\nThe two lower windows were lighted, and the dark figure of an old man,\nwith a skull-cap upon his head, was framed in one of them. It vanished\nas the sled stopped; the door was thrown open and the man came forth\nhurriedly, followed by a Russian nurse with a lantern.\n\n“Helena, my child, art thou come at last? What has befallen thee?”\n\nHe would evidently have said more, but the sight of Prince Boris caused\nhim to pause, while a quick shade of suspicion and alarm passed over his\nface. The Prince stepped forward, instantly relieved of his unaccustomed\ntimidity, and rapidly described the accident. The old nurse Katinka, had\nmeanwhile assisted the lovely Helena into the house.\n\nThe old man turned to follow, shivering in the night-air. Suddenly\nrecollecting himself, he begged the Prince to enter and take some\nrefreshments, but with the air and tone of a man who hopes that his\ninvitation will not be accepted. If such was really his hope, he was\ndisappointed; for Boris instantly commanded the istvostchik to wait for\nhim, and entered the humble dwelling.\n\nThe apartment into which he was ushered was spacious, and plainly,\nyet not shabbily furnished. A violoncello and clavichord, with several\nportfolios of music, and scattered sheets of ruled paper, proclaimed the\nprofession or the taste of the occupant. Having excused himself a moment\nto look after his daughter's condition, the old man, on his return,\nfound Boris turning over the leaves of a musical work.\n\n“You see my profession,” he said. “I teach music?”\n\n“Do you not compose?” asked the Prince.\n\n“That was once my ambition. I was a pupil of Sebastian Bach.\nBut--circumstances--necessity--brought me here. Other lives changed the\ndirection of mine. It was right!”\n\n“You mean your daughter's?” the Prince gently suggested.\n\n“Hers and her mother's. Our story was well known in St. Petersburg\ntwenty years ago, but I suppose no one recollects it now. My wife was\nthe daughter of a Baron von Plauen, and loved music and myself better\nthan her home and a titled bridegroom. She escaped, we united our lives,\nsuffered and were happy together,--and she died. That is all.”\n\nFurther conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Helena,\nwith steaming glasses of tea. She was even lovelier than before. Her\nclose-fitting dress revealed the symmetry of her form, and the quiet,\nunstudied grace of her movements. Although her garments were of\nwell-worn material, the lace which covered her bosom was genuine point\nd'Alencon, of an old and rare pattern. Boris felt that her air\nand manner were thoroughly noble; he rose and saluted her with the\nprofoundest respect.\n\nIn spite of the singular delight which her presence occasioned him,\nhe was careful not to prolong his visit beyond the limits of strict\netiquette. His name, Boris Alexeivitch, only revealed to his guests the\nname of his father, without his rank; and when he stated that he was\nemployed in one of the Departments, (which was true in a measure, for he\nwas a staff officer,) they could only look upon him as being, at best,\na member of some family whose recent elevation to the nobility did not\nrelease them from the necessity of Government service. Of course he\nemployed the usual pretext of wishing to study music, and either by that\nor some other stratagem managed to leave matters in such a shape that a\nsecond visit could not occasion surprise.\n\nAs the sled glided homewards over the crackling snow, he was obliged\nto confess the existence of a new and powerful excitement. Was it the\nchance of an adventure, such as certain of his comrades were continually\nseeking? He thought not; no, decidedly not. Was it--could it be--love?\nHe really could not tell; he had not the slightset idea what love was\nlike.\n\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nIt was something at least, that the plastic and not un-virtuous nature\nof the young man was directed towards a definite object. The elements\nout of which he was made, although somewhat diluted, were active enough\nto make him uncomfortable, so long as they remained in a confused state.\nHe had very little power of introversion, but he was sensible that his\ntemperament was changing,--that he grew more cheerful and contented with\nlife,--that a chasm somewhere was filling up,--just in proportion as\nhis acquaintance with the old music-master and his daughter became more\nfamiliar. His visits were made so brief, were so adroitly timed and\naccounted for by circumstances, that by the close of Lent he could feel\njustified in making the Easter call of a friend, and claim its attendant\nprivileges, without fear of being repulsed.\n\nThat Easter call was an era in his life. At the risk of his wealth and\nrank being suspected, he dressed himself in new and rich garments, and\nhurried away towards the Smolnoi. The old nurse, Katinka, in her scarlet\ngown, opened the door for him, and was the first to say, “Christ is\narisen!” What could he do but give her the usual kiss? Formerly he had\nkissed hundreds of serfs, men and women, on the sacred anniversary, with\na passive good-will. But Katinka's kiss seemed bitter, and he secretly\nrubbed his mouth after it. The music-master came next: grisly though\nhe might be, he was the St. Peter who stood at the gate of heaven. Then\nentered Helena, in white, like an angel. He took her hand, pronounced\nthe Easter greeting, and scarcely waited for the answer, “Truly he has\narisen!” before his lips found the way to hers. For a second they warmly\ntrembled and glowed together; and in another second some new and sweet\nand subtle relation seemed to be established between their natures.\n\nThat night Prince Boris wrote a long letter to his “chere maman,” in\npiquantly misspelt French, giving her the gossip of the court, and such\nfamily news as she usually craved. The purport of the letter, however,\nwas only disclosed in the final paragraph, and then in so negative a way\nthat it is doubtful whether the Princess Martha fully understood it.\n\n“Poing de mariajes pour moix!” he wrote,--but we will drop the\noriginal,--“I don't think of such a thing yet. Pashkoff dropped a hint,\nthe other day, but I kept my eyes shut. Perhaps you remember her?--fat,\nthick lips, and crooked teeth. Natalie D---- said to me, 'Have you ever\nbeen in love, Prince?” HAVE I, MAMAN? I did not know what answer to\nmake. What is love? How does one feel, when one has it? They laugh at it\nhere, and of course I should not wish to do what is laughable. Give me a\nhint: forewarned is forearmed, you know,'”--etc., etc.\n\nPerhaps the Princess Martha DID suspect something; perhaps some word\nin her son's letter touched a secret spot far back in her memory, and\nrenewed a dim, if not very intelligible, pain. She answered his question\nat length, in the style of the popular French romances of that day. She\nhad much to say of dew and roses, turtledoves and the arrows of Cupid.\n\n“Ask thyself,” she wrote, “whether felicity comes with her presence,\nand distraction with her absence,--whether her eyes make the morning\nbrighter for thee, and her tears fall upon thy heart like molten\nlava,--whether heaven would be black and dismal without her company, and\nthe flames of hell turn into roses under her feet.”\n\nIt was very evident that the good Princess Martha had never felt--nay,\ndid not comprehend--a passion such as she described.\n\nPrince Boris, however, whose veneration for his mother was unbounded,\ntook her words literally, and applied the questions to himself. Although\nhe found it difficult, in good faith and sincerity, to answer all of\nthem affirmatively (he was puzzled, for instance, to know the sensation\nof molten lava falling upon the heart), yet the general conclusion was\ninevitable: Helena was necessary to his happiness.\n\nInstead of returning to Kinesma for the summer, as had been arranged, he\ndetermined to remain in St. Petersburg, under the pretence of devoting\nhimself to military studies. This change of plan occasioned more\ndisappointment to the Princess Martha than vexation to Prince Alexis.\nThe latter only growled at the prospect of being called upon to advance\na further supply of rubles, slightly comforting himself with the\nmuttered reflection,--\n\n“Perhaps the brat will make a man of himself, after all.”\n\nIt was not many weeks, in fact, before the expected petition came to\nhand. The Princess Martha had also foreseen it, and instructed her son\nhow to attack his father's weak side. The latter was furiously jealous\nof certain other noblemen of nearly equal wealth, who were with him\nat the court of Peter the Great, as their sons now were at that of\nElizabeth. Boris compared the splendor of these young noblemen with his\nown moderate estate, fabled a few “adventures” and drinking-bouts, and\nannounced his determination of doing honor to the name which Prince\nAlexis of Kinesma had left behind him in the capital.\n\nThere was cursing at the castle when the letter arrived. Many serfs felt\nthe sting of the short whip, the slumber-flag was hoisted five minutes\nlater than usual, and the consumption of Cognac was alarming; but no\nmirror was smashed, and when Prince Alexis read the letter to his poor\nrelations, he even chuckled over some portions of it. Boris had boldly\ndemanded twenty thousand rubles, in the desperate hope of receiving half\nthat amount,--and he had calculated correctly.\n\nBefore midsummer he was Helena's accepted lover. Not, however, until\nthen, when her father had given his consent to their marriage in the\nautumn, did he disclose his true rank. The old man's face lighted up\nwith a glow of selfish satisfaction; but Helena quietly took her lover's\nhand, and said,--\n\n“Whatever you are, Boris, I will be faithful to you.”\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nLeaving Boris to discover the exact form and substance of the passion of\nlove, we will return for a time to the castle of Kinesma.\n\nWhether the Princess Martha conjectured what had transpired in St.\nPetersburg, or was partially informed of it by her son, cannot now\nbe ascertained. She was sufficiently weak, timid, and nervous, to be\ntroubled with the knowledge of the stratagem in which she had assisted\nin order to procure money, and that the ever-present consciousness\nthereof would betray itself to the sharp eyes of her husband. Certain it\nis, that the demeanor of the latter towards her and his household began\nto change about the end of the summer. He seemed to have a haunting\nsuspicion, that, in some way he had been, or was about to be,\noverreached. He grew peevish, suspicious, and more violent than ever in\nhis excesses.\n\nWhen Mishka, the dissipated bear already described, bit off one of the\nears of Basil, a hunter belonging to the castle, and Basil drew his\nknife and plunged it into Mishka's heart, Prince Alexis punished the\nhunter by cutting off his other ear, and sending him away to a distant\nestate. A serf, detected in eating a few of the pickled cherries\nintended for the Prince's botvinia, was placed in a cask, and pickled\ncherries packed around him up to the chin. There he was kept until\nalmost flayed by the acid. It was ordered that these two delinquents\nshould never afterwards be called by any other names than “Crop-Ear” and\n“Cherry.”\n\nBut the Prince's severest joke, which, strange to say, in no wise\nlessened his popularity among the serfs, occurred a month or two later.\nOne of his leading passions was the chase,--especially the chase in his\nown forests, with from one to two hundred men, and no one to dispute his\nLordship. On such occasions, a huge barrel of wine, mounted upon a\nsled, always accompanied the crowd, and the quantity which the hunters\nreceived depended upon the satisfaction of Prince Alexis with the game\nthey collected.\n\nWinter had set in early and suddenly, and one day, as the Prince and his\nretainers emerged from the forest with their forenoon's spoil, and found\nthemselves on the bank of the Volga, the water was already covered with\na thin sheet of ice. Fires were kindled, a score or two of hares and\na brace of deer were skinned, and the flesh placed on sticks to broil;\nskins of mead foamed and hissed into the wooden bowls, and the cask of\nunbroached wine towered in the midst. Prince Alexis had a good appetite;\nthe meal was after his heart; and by the time he had eaten a hare and\nhalf a flank of venison, followed by several bowls of fiery wine, he was\nin the humor for sport. He ordered a hole cut in the upper side of the\nbarrel, as it lay; then, getting astride of it, like a grisly Bacchus,\nhe dipped out the liquor with a ladle, and plied his thirsty serfs until\nthey became as recklessly savage as he.\n\nThey were scattered over a slope gently falling from the dark, dense\nfir-forest towards the Volga, where it terminated in a rocky palisade,\nten to fifteen feet in height. The fires blazed and crackled merrily in\nthe frosty air; the yells and songs of the carousers were echoed back\nfrom the opposite shore of the river. The chill atmosphere, the lowering\nsky, and the approaching night could not touch the blood of that wild\ncrowd. Their faces glowed and their eyes sparkled; they were ready for\nany deviltry which their lord might suggest.\n\nSome began to amuse themselves by flinging the clean-picked bones\nof deer and hare along the glassy ice of the Volga. Prince Alexis,\nperceiving this diverson, cried out in ecstasy,--\n\n“Oh, by St. Nicholas the Miracle-Worker, I'll give you better sport than\nthat, ye knaves! Here's the very place for a reisak,--do you hear me\nchildren?--a reisak! Could there be better ice? and then the rocks to\njump from! Come, children, come! Waska, Ivan, Daniel, you dogs, over\nwith you!”\n\nNow the reisak was a gymnastic performance peculiar to old Russia, and\ntherefore needs to be described. It could become popular only among a\npeople of strong physical qualities, and in a country where swift rivers\nfreeze rapidly from sudden cold. Hence we are of the opinion that\nit will not be introduced into our own winter diversions. A spot is\nselected where the water is deep and the current tolerably strong; the\nice must be about half an inch in thickness. The performer leaps head\nforemost from a rock or platform, bursts through the ice, is carried\nunder by the current, comes up some distance below, and bursts through\nagain. Both skill and strength are required to do the feat successfully.\n\nWaska, Ivan, Daniel, and a number of others, sprang to the brink of the\nrocks and looked over. The wall was not quite perpendicular, some large\nfragments having fallen from above and lodged along the base. It would\ntherefore require a bold leap to clear the rocks and strike the smooth\nice. They hesitated,--and no wonder.\n\nPrince Alexis howled with rage and disappointment.\n\n“The Devil take you, for a pack of whimpering hounds!” he cried. “Holy\nSaints! they are afraid to make a reisak!”\n\nIvan crossed himself and sprang. He cleared the rocks, but, instead of\nbursting through the ice with his head, fell at full length upon his\nback.\n\n“O knave!” yelled the Prince,--“not to know where his head is! Thinks\nit's his back! Give him fifteen stripes.”\n\nWhich was instantly done.\n\nThe second attempt was partially successful. One of the hunters broke\nthrough the ice, head foremost, going down, but he failed to come up\nagain; so the feat was only half performed.\n\nThe Prince became more furiously excited.\n\n“This is the way I'm treated!” he cried. “He forgets all about finishing\nthe reisak, and goes to chasing sterlet! May the carps eat him up for\nan ungrateful vagabond! Here, you beggars!” (addressing the poor\nrelations,) “take your turn, and let me see whether you are men.”\n\nOnly one of the frightened parasites had the courage to obey. On\nreaching the brink, he shut his eyes in mortal fear, and made a leap\nat random. The next moment he lay on the edge of the ice with one leg\nbroken against a fragment of rock.\n\nThis capped the climax of the Prince's wrath. He fell into a state\nbordering on despair, tore his hair, gnashed his teeth, and wept\nbitterly.\n\n“They will be the death of me!” was his lament. “Not a man among them!\nIt wasn't so in the old times. Such beautiful reisaks as I have seen!\nBut the people are becoming women,--hares,--chickens,--skunks! Villains,\nwill you force me to kill you? You have dishonored and disgraced me; I\nam ashamed to look my neighbors in the face. Was ever a man so treated?”\n\nThe serfs hung down their heads, feeling somehow responsible for their\nmaster's misery. Some of them wept, out of a stupid sympathy with his\ntears.\n\nAll at once he sprang down from the cask, crying in a gay, triumphant\ntone,--\n\n“I have it! Bring me Crop-Ear. He's the fellow for a reisak,--he can\nmake three, one after another.”\n\nOne of the boldest ventured to suggest that Crop-Ear had been sent away\nin disgrace to another of the Prince's estates.\n\n“Bring him here, I say? Take horses, and don't draw rein going or\ncoming. I will not stir from this spot until Crop-Ear comes.”\n\nWith these words, he mounted the barrel, and recommenced ladling out the\nwine. Huge fires were made, for the night was falling, and the cold had\nbecome intense. Fresh game was skewered and set to broil, and the tragic\ninterlude of the revel was soon forgotten.\n\nTowards midnight the sound of hoofs was heard, and the messengers\narrived with Crop-Ear. But, although the latter had lost his ears, he\nwas not inclined to split his head. The ice, meanwhile, had become\nso strong that a cannon-ball would have made no impression upon it.\nCrop-Ear simply threw down a stone heavier than himself, and, as it\nbounced and slid along the solid floor, said to Prince Alexis,--\n\n\n“Am I to go back, Highness, or stay here?”\n\n“Here, my son. Thou'rt a man. Come hither to me.”\n\nTaking the serf's head in his hands, he kissed him on both cheeks. Then\nhe rode homeward through the dark, iron woods, seated astride on the\nbarrel, and steadying himself with his arms around Crop-Ear's and\nWaska's necks.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nThe health of the Princess Martha, always delicate, now began to fail\nrapidly. She was less and less able to endure her husband's savage\nhumors, and lived almost exclusively in her own apartments. She never\nmentioned the name of Boris in his presence, for it was sure to throw\nhim into a paroxysm of fury. Floating rumors in regard to the young\nPrince had reached him from the capital, and nothing would convince him\nthat his wife was not cognizant of her son's doings. The poor Princess\nclung to her boy as to all that was left her of life, and tried to prop\nher failing strength with the hope of his speedy return. She was now\ntoo helpless to thwart his wishes in any way; but she dreaded, more\nthan death, the terrible SOMETHING which would surely take place between\nfather and son if her conjectures should prove to be true.\n\nOne day, in the early part of November, she received a letter from\nBoris, announcing his marriage. She had barely strength and presence of\nmind enough to conceal the paper in her bosom before sinking in a swoon.\nBy some means or other the young Prince had succeeded in overcoming\nall the obstacles to such a step: probably the favor of the Empress was\ncourted, in order to obtain her consent. The money he had received, he\nwrote, would be sufficient to maintain them for a few months, though not\nin a style befitting their rank. He was proud and happy; the Princess\nHelena would be the reigning beauty of the court, when he should present\nher, but he desired the sanction of his parents to the marriage, before\ntaking his place in society. He would write immediately to his father,\nand hoped, that, if the news brought a storm, Mishka might be on hand to\ndivert its force, as on a former occasion.\n\nUnder the weight of this imminent secret, the Princess Martha could\nneither eat nor sleep. Her body wasted to a shadow; at every noise in\nthe castle, she started and listened in terror, fearing that the news\nhad arrived.\n\nPrince Boris, no doubt, found his courage fail him when he set about\nwriting the promised letter; for a fortnight elapsed before it made its\nappearance. Prince Alexis received it on his return from the chase. He\nread it hastily through, uttered a prolonged roar like that of a wounded\nbull, and rushed into the castle. The sound of breaking furniture, of\ncrashing porcelain and shivered glass, came from the state apartments:\nthe domestics fell on their knees and prayed; the Princess, who heard\nthe noise and knew what it portended, became almost insensible from\nfright.\n\nOne of the upper servants entered a chamber as the Prince was in the\nact of demolishing a splendid malachite table, which had escaped all his\nprevious attacks. He was immediately greeted with a cry of,--\n\n“Send the Princess to me!”\n\n“Her Highness is not able to leave her chamber,” the man replied.\n\nHow it happened he could never afterwards describe but he found himself\nlying in a corner of the room. When he arose, there seemed to be a\nsingular cavity in his mouth: his upper front teeth were wanting.\n\nWe will not narrate what took place in the chamber of the Princess.\n\nThe nerves of the unfortunate woman had been so wrought upon by her\nfears, that her husband's brutal rage, familiar to her from long\nexperience, now possessed a new and alarming significance. His threats\nwere terrible to hear; she fell into convulsions, and before morning her\ntormented life was at an end.\n\nThere was now something else to think of, and the smashing of porcelain\nand cracking of whips came to an end. The Archimandrite was summoned,\nand preparations, both religious and secular, were made for a funeral\nworthy the rank of the deceased. Thousands flocked to Kinesma; and when\nthe immense procession moved away from the castle, although very few\nof the persons had ever known or cared in the least, for the Princess\nMartha, all, without exception, shed profuse tears. Yes, there was\none exception,--one bare, dry rock, rising alone out of the universal\ndeluge,--Prince Alexis himself, who walked behind the coffin, his eyes\nfixed and his features rigid as stone. They remarked that his face was\nhaggard, and that the fiery tinge on his cheeks and nose had faded into\nlivid purple. The only sign of emotion which he gave was a convulsive\nshudder, which from time to time passed over his whole body.\n\nThree archimandrites (abbots) and one hundred priests headed the solemn\nfuneral procession from the castle to the church on the opposite hill.\nThere the mass for the dead was chanted, the responses being sung by\na choir of silvery boyish voices. All the appointments were of the\ncostliest character. Not only all those within the church, but the\nthousands outside, spared not their tears, but wept until the fountains\nwere exhausted. Notice was given, at the close of the services, that\n“baked meats” would be furnished to the multitude, and that all beggars\nwho came to Kinesma would be charitably fed for the space of six weeks.\nThus, by her death, the amiable Princess Martha was enabled to dispense\nmore charity than had been permitted to her life.\n\nAt the funeral banquet which followed, Prince Alexis placed the Abbot\nSergius at his right hand, and conversed with him in the most edifying\nmanner upon the necessity of leading a pure and godly life. His remarks\nupon the duty of a Christian, upon brotherly love, humility, and\nself-sacrifice, brought tears into the eyes of the listening priests. He\nexpressed his conviction that the departed Princess, by the piety of her\nlife, had attained unto salvation,--and added, that his own life had now\nno further value unless he should devote it to religious exercises.\n\n“Can you not give me a place in your monastery?” he asked, turning to\nthe Abbot. “I will endow it with a gift of forty thousand rubles, for\nthe privilege of occupying a monk's cell.”\n\n“Pray, do not decide too hastily, Highness,” the Abbot replied. “You\nhave yet a son.”\n\n“What!” yelled Prince Alexis, with flashing eyes, every trace of\nhumility and renunciation vanishing like smoke,--“what! Borka? The\ninfamous wretch who has ruined me, killed his mother, and brought\ndisgrace upon our name? Do you know that he has married a wench of no\nfamily and without a farthing,--who would be honored, if I should allow\nher to feed my hogs? Live for HIM? live for HIM? Ah-R-R-R!”\n\nThis outbreak terminated in a sound between a snarl and a bellow. The\npriests turned pale, but the Abbot devoutly remarked--\n\n“Encompassed by sorrows, Prince, you should humbly submit to the will of\nthe Lord.”\n\n“Submit to Borka?” the Prince scornfully laughed. “I know what I'll\ndo. There's time enough yet for a wife and another child,--ay,--a dozen\nchildren! I can have my pick in the province; and if I couldn't I'd\nsooner take Masha, the goose-girl, than leave Borka the hope of stepping\ninto my shoes. Beggars they shall be,--beggars!”\n\nWhat further he might have said was interrupted by the priests rising\nto chant the Blajennon uspennie (blessed be the dead),--after which,\nthe trisna, a drink composed of mead, wine, and rum, was emptied to\nthe health of the departed soul. Every one stood during this ceremony,\nexcept Prince Alexis, who fell suddenly prostrate before the consecrated\npictures, and sobbed so passionately that the tears of the guests flowed\nfor the third time. There he lay until night; for whenever any one dared\nto touch him, he struck out furiously with fists and feet. Finally he\nfell asleep on the floor, and the servants then bore him to his sleeping\napartment.\n\nFor several days afterward his grief continued to be so violent that the\noccupants of the castle were obliged to keep out of his way. The whip\nwas never out of his hand, and he used it very recklessly, not always\nselecting the right person. The parasitic poor relations found their\nsituation so uncomfortable, that they decided, one and all, to detach\nthemselves from the tree upon which they fed and fattened, even at the\nrisk of withering on a barren soil. Night and morning the serfs prayed\nupon their knees, with many tears and groans, that the Saints might send\nconsolation, in any form, to their desperate lord.\n\nThe Saints graciously heard and answered the prayer. Word came that a\nhuge bear had been seen in the forest stretching towards Juriewetz. The\nsorrowing Prince pricked up his ears, threw down his whip, and ordered a\nchase. Sasha, the broad-shouldered, the cunning, the ready, the untiring\ncompanion of his master, secretly ordered a cask of vodki to follow the\ncrowd of hunters and serfs. There was a steel-bright sky, a low, yellow\nsun, and a brisk easterly wind from the heights of the Ural. As the\ncrisp snow began to crunch under the Prince's sled, his followers saw\nthe old expression come back to his face. With song and halloo and blast\nof horns, they swept away into the forest.\n\nSaint John the Hunter must have been on guard over Russia that day.\n\nThe great bear was tracked, and after a long and exciting chase, fell by\nthe hand of Prince Alexis himself. Halt was made in an open space in the\nforest, logs were piled together and kindled on the snow, and just at\nthe right moment (which no one knew better than Sasha) the cask of vodki\nrolled into its place. When the serfs saw the Prince mount astride of\nit, with his ladle in his hand, they burst into shouts of extravagant\njoy. “Slava Bogu!” (Glory be to God!) came fervently from the bearded\nlips of those hard, rough, obedient children. They tumbled headlong over\neach other, in their efforts to drink first from the ladle, to clasp\nthe knees or kiss the hands of the restored Prince. And the dawn was\nglimmering against the eastern stars, as they took the way to the\ncastle, making the ghostly fir-woods ring with shout and choric song.\n\nNevertheless, Prince Alexis was no longer the same man; his giant\nstrength and furious appetite were broken. He was ever ready, as\nformerly, for the chase and the drinking-bout; but his jovial mood no\nlonger grew into a crisis which only utter physical exhaustion or the\nstupidity of drunkenness could overcome. Frequently, while astride the\ncask, his shouts of laughter would suddenly cease, the ladle would drop\nfrom his hand, and he would sit motionless, staring into vacancy for\nfive minutes at a time. Then the serfs, too, became silent, and stood\nstill, awaiting a change. The gloomy mood passed away as suddenly. He\nwould start, look about him, and say, in a melancholy voice,--\n\n“Have I frightened you, my children? It seems to me that I am getting\nold. Ah, yes, we must all die, one day. But we need not think about it,\nuntil the time comes. The Devil take me for putting it into my head!\nWhy, how now? can't you sing, children?”\n\nThen he would strike up some ditty which they all knew: a hundred voices\njoined in the strain, and the hills once more rang with revelry.\n\nSince the day when the Princess Martha was buried, the Prince had not\nagain spoken of marriage. No one, of course, dared to mention the name\nof Boris in his presence.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nThe young Prince had, in reality, become the happy husband of Helena.\nHis love for her had grown to be a shaping and organizing influence,\nwithout which his nature would have fallen into its former confusion. If\na thought of a less honorable relation had ever entered his mind, it was\npresently banished by the respect which a nearer intimacy inspired;\nand thus Helena, magnetically drawing to the surface only his best\nqualities, loved, unconsciously to herself, her own work in him. Ere\nlong, she saw that she might balance the advantages he had conferred\nupon her in their marriage by the support and encouragement which she\nwas able to impart to him; and this knowledge, removing all painful\nsense of obligation, made her both happy and secure in her new position.\n\nThe Princess Martha, under some presentiment of her approaching death,\nhad intrusted one of the ladies in attendance upon her with the secret\nof her son's marriage, in addition to a tender maternal message, and\nsuch presents of money and jewelry as she was able to procure without\nher husband's knowledge. These presents reached Boris very opportunely;\nfor, although Helena developed a wonderful skill in regulating his\nexpenses, the spring was approaching, and even the limited circle of\nsociety in which they had moved during the gay season had made heavy\ndemands upon his purse. He became restless and abstracted, until his\nwife, who by this time clearly comprehended the nature of his trouble,\nhad secretly decided how it must be met.\n\nThe slender hoard of the old music-master, with a few thousand rubles\nfrom Prince Boris, sufficed for his modest maintenance. Being now free\nfrom the charge of his daughter, he determined to visit Germany, and, if\ncircumstances were propitious, to secure a refuge for his old age in his\nfavorite Leipsic. Summer was at hand, and the court had already removed\nto Oranienbaum. In a few weeks the capital would be deserted.\n\n“Shall we go to Germany with your father?” asked Boris, as he sat at a\nwindow with Helena, enjoying the long twilight.\n\n“No, my Boris,” she answered; “we will go to Kinesma.”\n\n“But--Helena,--golubchik, mon ange,--are you in earnest?”\n\n“Yes, my Boris. The last letter from your--our cousin Nadejda convinces\nme that the step must be taken. Prince Alexis has grown much older since\nyour mother's death; he is lonely and unhappy. He may not welcome us,\nbut he will surely suffer us to come to him; and we must then begin the\nwork of reconciliation. Reflect, my Boris, that you have keenly wounded\nhim in the tenderest part,--his pride,--and you must therefore cast away\nyour own pride, and humbly and respectfully, as becomes a son, solicit\nhis pardon.”\n\n“Yes,” said he, hesitatingly, “you are right. But I know his violence\nand recklessness, as you do not. For myself, alone, I am willing to\nmeet him; yet I fear for your sake. Would you not tremble to encounter a\nmaddened and brutal mujik?--then how much more to meet Alexis Pavlovitch\nof Kinesma!”\n\n“I do not and shall not tremble,” she replied. “It is not your marriage\nthat has estranged your father, but your marriage with ME. Having been,\nunconsciously, the cause of the trouble, I shall deliberately, and as\na sacred duty, attempt to remove it. Let us go to Kinesma, as humble,\npenitent children, and cast ourselves upon your father's mercy. At the\nworst, he can but reject us; and you will have given me the consolation\nof knowing that I have tried, as your wife, to annul the sacrifice you\nhave made for my sake.”\n\n“Be it so, then!” cried Boris, with a mingled feeling of relief and\nanxiety.\n\nHe was not unwilling that the attempt should be made, especially since\nit was his wife's desire; but he knew his father too well to anticipate\nimmediate success. All threatening POSSIBILITIES suggested themselves to\nhis mind; all forms of insult and outrage which he had seen perpetrated\nat Kinesma filled his memory. The suspense became at last worse than any\nprobable reality. He wrote to his father, announcing a speedy visit\nfrom himself and his wife; and two days afterwards the pair left St.\nPetersburg in a large travelling kibitka.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\nWhen Prince Alexis received his son's letter, an expression of fierce,\ncruel delight crept over his face, and there remained, horribly\nilluminating its haggard features. The orders given for swimming\nhorses in the Volga--one of his summer diversions--were immediately\ncountermanded; he paced around the parapet of the castle-wall until near\nmidnight, followed by Sasha with a stone jug of vodki. The latter had\nthe useful habit, notwithstanding his stupid face, of picking up the\nfragments of soliloquy which the Prince dropped, and answering them as\nif talking to himself. Thus he improved upon and perfected many a hint\nof cruelty, and was too discreet ever to dispute his master's claim to\nthe invention.\n\nSasha, we may be sure, was busy with his devil's work that night.\nThe next morning the stewards and agents of Prince Alexis, in castle,\nvillage, and field, were summoned to his presence.\n\n“Hark ye!” said he; “Borka and his trumpery wife send me word that they\nwill be here to-morrow. See to it that every man, woman, and child, for\nten versts out on the Moskovskoi road, knows of their coming. Let it be\nknown that whoever uncovers his head before them shall uncover his back\nfor a hundred lashes. Whomsoever they greet may bark like a dog, meeouw\nlike a cat, or bray like an ass, as much as he chooses; but if he speaks\na decent word, his tongue shall be silenced with stripes. Whoever shall\ninsult them has my pardon in advance. Oh, let them come!--ay, let them\ncome! Come they may: but how they go away again”----\n\nThe Prince Alexis suddenly stopped, shook his head, and walked up\nand down the hall, muttering to himself. His eyes were bloodshot, and\nsparkled with a strange light. What the stewards had heard was plain\nenough; but that something more terrible than insult was yet held in\nreserve they did not doubt. It was safe, therefore, not only to fulfil,\nbut to exceed, the letter of their instructions. Before night the whole\npopulation were acquainted with their duties; and an unusual mood of\nexpectancy, not unmixed with brutish glee, fell upon Kinesma.\n\nBy the middle of the next forenoon, Boris and his wife, seated in\nthe open kibitka, drawn by post-horses, reached the boundaries of\nthe estate, a few versts from the village. They were both silent and\nslightly pale at first, but now began to exchange mechanical remarks, to\ndivert each other's thoughts from the coming reception.\n\n“Here are the fields of Kinesma at last!” exclaimed Prince Boris.\n“We shall see the church and castle from the top of that hill in the\ndistance. And there is Peter, my playmate, herding the cattle!\n\n“Peter! Good-day, brotherkin!”\n\nPeter looked, saw the carriage close upon him, and, after a moment of\nhesitation, let his arms drop stiffly by his sides, and began howling\nlike a mastiff by moonlight. Helena laughed heartily at this singular\nresponse to the greeting; but Boris, after the first astonishment was\nover, looked terrified.\n\n“That was done by order,” said he, with a bitter smile. “The old bear\nstretches his claws out. Dare you try his hug?”\n\n“I do not fear,” she answered, her face was calm.\n\nEvery serf they passed obeyed the order of Prince Alexis according\nto his own idea of disrespect. One turned his back; another made\ncontemptuous grimaces and noises; another sang a vulgar song; another\nspat upon the ground or held his nostrils. Nowhere was a cap raised, or\nthe stealthy welcome of a friendly glance given.\n\nThe Princess Helena met these insults with a calm, proud indifference.\nBoris felt them more keenly; for the fields and hills were prospectively\nhis property, and so also were the brutish peasants. It was a form of\nchastisement which he had never before experienced, and knew not how to\nresist. The affront of an entire community was an offence against which\nhe felt himself to be helpless.\n\nAs they approached the town, the demonstrations of insolence were\nredoubled. About two hundred boys, between the ages of ten and fourteen,\nawaited them on the hill below the church, forming themselves into files\non either side of the road. These imps had been instructed to stick\nout their tongues in derision, and howl, as the carriage passed between\nthem. At the entrance of the long main street of Kinesma, they were\nobliged to pass under a mock triumphal arch, hung with dead dogs and\ndrowned cats; and from this point the reception assumed an outrageous\ncharacter. Howls, hootings, and hisses were heard on all sides; bouquets\nof nettles and vile weeds were flung to them; even wreaths of spoiled\nfish dropped from the windows. The women were the most eager and\nuproarious in this carnival of insult: they beat their saucepans, threw\npails of dirty water upon the horses, pelted the coachman with rotten\ncabbages, and filled the air with screeching and foul words.\n\nIt was impossible to pass through this ordeal with indifference. Boris,\nfinding that his kindly greetings were thrown away,--that even his old\nacquaintances in the bazaar howled like the rest,--sat with head bowed\nand despair in his heart. The beautiful eyes of Helena were heavy with\ntears; but she no longer trembled, for she knew the crisis was yet to\ncome.\n\nAs the kibitka slowly climbed the hill on its way to the castle-gate,\nPrince Alexis, who had heard and enjoyed the noises in the village from\na balcony on the western tower, made his appearance on the head of the\nsteps which led from the court-yard to the state apartments. The dreaded\nwhip was in his hand; his eyes seemed about to start from their sockets,\nin their wild, eager, hungry gaze; the veins stood out like cords on his\nforehead; and his lips, twitching involuntarily, revealed the glare\nof his set teeth. A frightened hush filled the castle. Some of the\ndomestics were on their knees; others watching, pale and breathless,\nfrom the windows: for all felt that a greater storm than they had ever\nexperienced was about to burst. Sasha and the castle-steward had taken\nthe wise precaution to summon a physician and a priest, provided\nwith the utensils for extreme unction. Both of these persons had been\nsmuggled in through a rear entrance, and were kept concealed until their\nservices should be required.\n\nThe noise of wheels was heard outside the gate, which stood invitingly\nopen. Prince Alexis clutched his whip with iron fingers, and\nunconsciously took the attitude of a wild beast about to spring from its\nambush. Now the hard clatter of hoofs and the rumbling, of wheels echoed\nfrom the archway, and the kibitka rolled into the courtyard. It stopped\nnear the foot of the grand staircase. Boris, who sat upon the farther\nside, rose to alight, in order to hand down his wife; but no sooner\nhad he made a movement than Prince Alexis, with lifted whip and face\nflashing fire, rushed down the steps. Helena rose, threw back her veil,\nlet her mantle (which Boris had grasped, in his anxiety to restrain her\naction,) fall behind her, and stepped upon the pavement.\n\nPrince Alexis had already reached the last step, and but a few feet\nseparated them. He stopped as if struck by lightning,--his body still\nretaining, in every limb, the impress of motion. The whip was in his\nuplifted fist; one foot was on the pavement of the court, and the other\nupon the edge of the last step; his head was bent forward, his mouth\nopen, and his eyes fastened upon the Princess Helena's face.\n\nShe, too, stood motionless, a form of simple and perfect grace, and met\nhis gaze with soft, imploring, yet courageous and trustful eyes. The\nwomen who watched the scene from the galleries above always declared\nthat an invisible saint stood beside her in that moment, and surrounded\nher with a dazzling glory. The few moments during which the suspense of\na hundred hearts hung upon those encountering eyes seemed an eternity.\n\nPrince Alexis did not move, but he began to tremble from head to foot.\nHis fingers relaxed, and the whip fell ringing upon the pavement. The\nwild fire of his eyes changed from wrath into an ecstasy as intense, and\na piercing cry of mingled wonder, admiration and delight burst from his\nthroat. At that cry Boris rushed forward and knelt at his feet. Helena,\nclasping her fairest hands, sank beside her husband, with upturned\nface, as if seeking the old man's eyes, and perfect the miracle she had\nwrought.\n\nThe sight of that sweet face, so near his own, tamed the last lurking\nferocity of the beast. His tears burst forth in a shower; he lifted and\nembraced the Princess, kissing her brow, her cheeks, her chin, and her\nhands, calling her his darling daughter, his little white dove, his\nlambkin.\n\n“And, father, my Boris, too!” said she.\n\nThe pure liquid voice sent thrills of exquisite delight through his\nwhole frame. He embraced and blessed Boris, and then, throwing an arm\naround each, held them to his breast, and wept passionately upon their\nheads. By this time the whole castle overflowed with weeping. Tears fell\nfrom every window and gallery; they hissed upon the hot saucepans of the\ncooks; they moistened the oats in the manger; they took the starch out\nof the ladies' ruffles, and weakened the wine in the goblets of the\nguests. Insult was changed into tenderness in a moment. Those who had\nbarked or stuck out their tongues at Boris rushed up to kiss his boots;\na thousand terms of endearment were showered upon him.\n\nStill clasping his children to his breast, Prince Alexis mounted the\nsteps with them. At the top he turned, cleared his throat, husky from\nsobbing, and shouted--\n\n“A feast! a feast for all Kinesma! Let there be rivers of vodki, wine\nand hydromel! Proclaim it everywhere that my dear son Boris and my\ndear daughter Helena have arrived, and whoever fails to welcome them to\nKinesma shall be punished with a hundred stripes! Off, ye scoundrels, ye\nvagabonds, and spread the news!”\n\nIt was not an hour before the whole sweep of the circling hills\nresounded with the clang of bells, the blare of horns, and the songs\nand shouts of the rejoicing multitude. The triumphal arch of unsavory\nanimals was whirled into the Volga; all signs of the recent reception\nvanished like magic; festive fir-boughs adorned the houses, and the\ngardens and window-pots were stripped of their choicest flowers to make\nwreaths of welcome. The two hundred boys, not old enough to comprehend\nthis sudden bouleversement of sentiment, did not immediately desist from\nsticking out their tongues: whereupon they were dismissed with a box\non the ear. By the middle of the afternoon all Kinesma was eating,\ndrinking, and singing; and every song was sung, and every glass emptied\nin honor of the dear, good Prince Boris, and the dear, beautiful\nPrincess Helena. By night all Kinesma was drunk.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nIn the castle a superb banquet was improvised. Music, guests, and rare\ndishes were brought together with wonderful speed, and the choicest\nwines of the cellar were drawn upon. Prince Boris, bewildered by this\nsudden and incredible change in his fortunes, sat at his father's right\nhand, while the Princess filled, but with much more beauty and dignity,\nthe ancient place of the Princess Martha. The golden dishes were set\nbefore her, and the famous family emeralds--in accordance with the\ncommand of Prince Alexis--gleamed among her dark hair and flashed around\nher milk-white throat. Her beauty was of a kind so rare in Russia\nthat it silenced all question and bore down all rivalry. Every one\nacknowledged that so lovely a creature had never before been seen.\n“Faith, the boy has eyes!” the old Prince constantly repeated, as he\nturned away from a new stare of admiration, down the table.\n\nThe guests noticed a change in the character of the entertainment. The\nidiot, in his tow shirt, had been crammed to repletion in the kitchen,\nand was now asleep in the stable. Razboi, the new bear,--the successor\nof the slaughtered Mishka,--was chained up out of hearing. The jugglers,\ntumblers, and Calmucks still occupied their old place under the gallery,\nbut their performances were of a highly decorous character. At the\nleast-sign of a relapse into certain old tricks, more grotesque than\nrefined, the brows of Prince Alexis would grow dark, and a sharp glance\nat Sasha was sufficient to correct the indiscretion. Every one found\nthis natural enough; for they were equally impressed with the elegance\nand purity of the young wife. After the healths had been drunk and the\nslumber-flag was raised over the castle, Boris led her into the splendid\napartments of his mother,--now her own,--and knelt at her feet.\n\n“Have I done my part, my Boris?” she asked.\n\n“You are an angel!” he cried. “It was a miracle! My life was not worth\na copek, and I feared for yours. If it will only last!--if it will only\nlast!”\n\n“It WILL,” said she. “You have taken me from poverty, and given me rank,\nwealth, and a proud place in the world: let it be my work to keep the\npeace which God has permitted me to establish between you and your\nfather!”\n\nThe change in the old Prince, in fact, was more radical than any one who\nknew his former ways of life would have considered possible. He stormed\nand swore occasionally, flourished his whip to some purpose, and rode\nhome from the chase, not outside of a brandy cask, as once, but with\ntoo much of its contents inside of him: but these mild excesses were\ncomparative virtues. His accesses of blind rage seemed to be at an end.\nA powerful, unaccustomed feeling of content subdued his strong nature,\nand left its impress on his voice and features. He joked and sang\nwith his “children,” but not with the wild recklessness of the days of\nreisaks and indiscriminate floggings. Both his exactions and his favors\ndiminished in quantity. Week after week passed by, and there was no sign\nof any return to his savage courses.\n\nNothing annoyed him so much as a reference to his former way of life,\nin the presence of the Princess Helena. If her gentle, questioning eyes\nhappened to rest on him at such times, something very like a blush rose\ninto his face, and the babbler was silenced with a terribly significant\nlook. It was enough for her to say, when he threatened an act of cruelty\nand injustice, “Father, is that right?” He confusedly retracted his\norders, rather than bear the sorrow of her face.\n\nThe promise of another event added to his happiness: Helena would\nsoon become a mother. As the time drew near he stationed guards at\nthe distance of a verst around the castle, that no clattering vehicles\nshould pass, no dogs bark loudly, nor any other disturbance occur which\nmight agitate the Princess. The choicest sweetmeats and wines, flowers\nfrom Moscow and fruits from Astrakhan, were procured for her; and it was\na wonder that the midwife performed her duty, for she had the fear\nof death before her eyes. When the important day at last arrived the\nslumber-flag was instantly hoisted, and no mouse dared to squeak in\nKinesma until the cannon announced the advent of a new soul.\n\nThat night Prince Alexis lay down in the corridor, outside of\nHelena's door: he glared fiercely at the nurse as she entered with the\nbirth-posset for the young mother. No one else was allowed to pass, that\nnight, nor the next. Four days afterwards, Sasha, having a message to\nthe Princess, and supposing the old man to be asleep, attempted to step\nnoiselessly over his body. In a twinkle the Prince's teeth fastened\nthemselves in the serf's leg, and held him with the tenacity of a\nbull-dog. Sasha did not dare to cry out: he stood, writhing with pain,\nuntil the strong jaws grew weary of their hold, and then crawled away to\ndress the bleeding wound. After that, no one tried to break the Prince's\nguard.\n\nThe christening was on a magnificent scale. Prince Paul of Kostroma was\ngodfather, and gave the babe the name of Alexis. As the Prince had paid\nhis respects to Helena just before the ceremony, it may be presumed that\nthe name was not of his own inspiration. The father and mother were\nnot allowed to be present, but they learned that the grandfather had\ncomported himself throughout with great dignity and propriety. The\nArchimandrite Sergius obtained from the Metropolitan at Moscow a very\nminute fragment of the true cross, which was encased in a hollow bead\nof crystal, and hung around the infant's neck by a fine gold chain, as a\nprecious amulet.\n\nPrince Alexis was never tired of gazing at his grandson and namesake.\n\n“He has more of his mother than of Boris,” he would say. “So much the\nbetter! Strong dark eyes, like the Great Peter,--and what a goodly leg\nfor a babe! Ha! he makes a tight little fist already,--fit to handle a\nwhip,--or” (seeing the expression of Helena's face)--“or a sword. He'll\nbe a proper Prince of Kinesma, my daughter, and we owe it to you.”\n\nHelena smiled, and gave him a grateful glance in return. She had had her\nsecret fears as to the complete conversion of Prince Alexis; but now she\nsaw in this babe a new spell whereby he might be bound. Slight as was\nher knowledge of men, she yet guessed the tyranny of long-continued\nhabits; and only her faith, powerful in proportion as it was ignorant,\ngave her confidence in the result of the difficult work she had\nundertaken.\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nAlas! the proud predictions of Prince Alexis, and the protection of the\nsacred amulet, were alike unavailing. The babe sickened, wasted away,\nand died in less than two months after its birth. There was great and\ngenuine sorrow among the serfs of Kinesma. Each had received a shining\nruble of silver at the christening; and, moreover, they were now\nbeginning to appreciate the milder regime of their lord, which this blow\nmight suddenly terminate. Sorrow, in such natures as his, exasperates\ninstead of chastening: they knew him well enough to recognize the\ndanger.\n\nAt first the old man's grief appeared to be of a stubborn, harmless\nnature. As soon as the funeral ceremonies were over he betook himself to\nhis bed, and there lay for two days and nights, without eating a morsel\nof food. The poor Princess Helena, almost prostrated by the blow,\nmourned alone, or with Boris, in her own apartments. Her influence,\nno longer kept alive by her constant presence, as formerly, began to\ndecline. When the old Prince aroused somewhat from his stupor, it was\nnot meat that he demanded, but drink; and he drank to angry excess.\nDay after day the habit resumed its ancient sway, and the whip and the\nwild-beast yell returned with it. The serfs even began to tremble as\nthey never had done, so long as his vices were simply those of a strong\nman; for now a fiendish element seemed to be slowly creeping in. He\nbecame horribly profane: they shuddered when he cursed the venerable\nMetropolitan of Moscow, declaring that the old sinner had deliberately\nkilled his grandson, by sending to him, instead of the true cross of the\nSaviour, a piece of the tree to which the impenitent thief was nailed.\n\nBoris would have spared his wife the knowledge of this miserable\nrelapse, in her present sorrow, but the information soon reached her in\nother ways. She saw the necessity of regaining, by a powerful effort,\nwhat she had lost. She therefore took her accustomed place at the table,\nand resumed her inspection of household matters. Prince Alexis, as if\ndetermined to cast off the yoke which her beauty and gentleness had laid\nupon him, avoided looking at her face or speaking to her, as much as\npossible: when he did so, his manner was cold and unfriendly. During her\nfew days of sad retirement he had brought back the bear Razboi and the\nidiot to his table, and vodki was habitually poured out to him and his\nfavorite serfs in such a measure that the nights became hideous with\ndrunken tumult.\n\nThe Princess Helena felt that her beauty no longer possessed the potency\nof its first surprise. It must now be a contest of nature with nature,\nspiritual with animal power. The struggle would be perilous, she\nforesaw, but she did not shrink; she rather sought the earliest occasion\nto provoke it.\n\nThat occasion came. Some slight disappointment brought on one of the old\nparoxysms of rage, and the ox-like bellow of Prince Alexis rang through\nthe castle. Boris was absent, but Helena delayed not a moment to venture\ninto his father's presence. She found him in a hall over-looking the\ncourt-yard, with his terrible whip in his hand, giving orders for the\nbrutal punishment of some scores of serfs. The sight of her, coming thus\nunexpectedly upon him, did not seem to produce the least effect.\n\n“Father!” she cried, in an earnest, piteous tone, “what is it you do?”\n\n“Away, witch!” he yelled. “I am the master in Kinesma, not thou! Away,\nor--”\n\nThe fierceness with which he swung and cracked the whip was more\nthreatening than any words. Perhaps she grew a shade paler, perhaps her\nhands were tightly clasped in order that they might not tremble; but she\ndid not flinch from the encounter. She moved a step nearer, fixed her\ngaze upon his flashing eyes, and said, in a low, firm voice--\n\n“It is true, father, you are master here. It is easy to rule over those\npoor, submissive slaves. But you are not master over yourself; you are\nlashed and trampled upon by evil passions, and as much a slave as any of\nthese. Be not weak, my father, but strong!”\n\nAn expression of bewilderment came into his face. No such words had ever\nbefore been addressed to him, and he knew not how to reply to them. The\nPrincess Helena followed up the effect--she was not sure that it was\nan advantage--by an appeal to the simple, childish nature which she\nbelieved to exist under his ferocious exterior. For a minute it seemed\nas if she were about to re-establish her ascendancy: then the stubborn\nresistance of the beast returned.\n\nAmong the portraits in the hall was one of the deceased Princess Martha.\nPointing to this, Helena cried--\n\n“See, my father! here are the features of your sainted wife! Think that\nshe looks down from her place among the blessed, sees you, listens to\nyour words, prays that your hard heart may be softened! Remember her\nlast farewell to you on earth, her hope of meeting you--”\n\nA cry of savage wrath checked her. Stretching one huge, bony hand, as if\nto close her lips, trembling with rage and pain, livid and convulsed in\nevery feature of his face, Prince Alexis reversed the whip in his right\nhand, and weighed its thick, heavy butt for one crashing, fatal blow.\nLife and death were evenly balanced. For an instant the Princess became\ndeadly pale, and a sickening fear shot through her heart. She could not\nunderstand the effect of her words: her mind was paralyzed, and what\nfollowed came without her conscious volition.\n\nNot retreating a step, not removing her eyes from the terrible picture\nbefore her, she suddenly opened her lips and sang. Her voice of\nexquisite purity, power, and sweetness, filled the old hall and\noverflowed it, throbbing in scarcely weakened vibrations through\ncourt-yard and castle. The melody was a prayer--the cry of a tortured\nheart for pardon and repose; and she sang it with almost supernatural\nexpression. Every sound in the castle was hushed: the serfs outside\nknelt and uncovered their heads.\n\nThe Princess could never afterwards describe, or more than dimly recall,\nthe exaltation of that moment. She sang in an inspired trance: from the\nutterance of the first note the horror of the imminent fate sank out of\nsight. Her eyes were fixed upon the convulsed face, but she beheld it\nnot: all the concentrated forces of her life flowed into the music. She\nremembered, however, that Prince Alexis looked alternately from her face\nto the portrait of his wife; that he at last shuddered and grew\npale; and that, when with the closing note her own strength suddenly\ndissolved, he groaned and fell upon the floor.\n\nShe sat down beside him, and took his head upon her lap. For a long time\nhe was silent, only shivering as if in fever.\n\n“Father!” she finally whispered, “let me take you away!”\n\nHe sat up on the floor and looked around; but as his eyes encountered\nthe portrait, he gave a loud howl and covered his face with his hands.\n\n“She turns her head!” he cried. “Take her away,--she follows me with her\neyes! Paint her head black, and cover it up!”\n\nWith some difficulty he was borne to his bed, but he would not rest\nuntil assured that his orders had been obeyed, and the painting covered\nfor the time with a coat of lamp-black. A low, prolonged attack of fever\nfollowed, during which the presence of Helena was indispensable to his\ncomfort. She ventured to leave the room only while he slept. He was like\na child in her hands; and when she commended his patience or his good\nresolutions, his face beamed with joy and gratitude. He determined (in\ngood faith, this time) to enter a monastery and devote the rest of his\nlife to pious works.\n\nBut, even after his recovery, he was still too weak and dependent on his\nchildren's attentions to carry out this resolution. He banished from the\ncastle all those of his poor relations who were unable to drink vodki in\nmoderation; he kept careful watch over his serfs, and those who\nbecame intoxicated (unless they concealed the fact in the stables and\nouthouses) were severely punished: all excess disappeared, and a reign\nof peace and gentleness descended upon Kinesma.\n\nIn another year another Alexis was born, and lived, and soon grew strong\nenough to give his grandfather the greatest satisfaction he had ever\nknown in his life, by tugging at his gray locks, and digging the small\nfingers into his tamed and merry eyes. Many years after Prince Alexis\nwas dead the serfs used to relate how they had seen him, in the bright\nsummer afternoons, asleep in his armchair on the balcony, with the rosy\nbabe asleep on his bosom, and the slumber-flag waving over both.\n\nLegends of the Prince's hunts, reisaks, and brutal revels are still\ncurrent along the Volga; but they are now linked to fairer and more\ngracious stories; and the free Russian farmers (no longer serfs) are\nnever tired of relating incidents of the beauty, the courage, the\nbenevolence, and the saintly piety of the Good Lady of Kinesma.\n\n\n\n\n\nTALES OF HOME.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STRANGE FRIEND.\n\n\nIt would have required an intimate familiarity with the habitual\ndemeanor of the people of Londongrove to detect in them an access of\ninterest (we dare not say excitement), of whatever kind. Expression with\nthem was pitched to so low a key that its changes might be compared to\nthe slight variations in the drabs and grays in which they were clothed.\nYet that there was a moderate, decorously subdued curiosity present in\nthe minds of many of them on one of the First-days of the Ninth-month,\nin the year 1815, was as clearly apparent to a resident of the\nneighborhood as are the indications of a fire or a riot to the member of\na city mob.\n\nThe agitations of the war which had so recently come to an end had\nhardly touched this quiet and peaceful community. They had stoutly\n“borne their testimony,” and faced the question where it could not be\nevaded; and although the dashing Philadelphia militia had been stationed\nat Camp Bloomfield, within four miles of them, the previous year, these\ngood people simply ignored the fact. If their sons ever listened to the\ntrumpets at a distance, or stole nearer to have a peep at the uniforms,\nno report of what they had seen or heard was likely to be made at home.\nPeace brought to them a relief, like the awakening from an uncomfortable\ndream: their lives at once reverted to the calm which they had breathed\nfor thirty years preceding the national disturbance. In their ways they\nhad not materially changed for a hundred years. The surplus produce of\ntheir farms more than sufficed for the very few needs which those farms\ndid not supply, and they seldom touched the world outside of their sect\nexcept in matters of business. They were satisfied with themselves and\nwith their lot; they lived to a ripe and beautiful age, rarely “borrowed\ntrouble,” and were patient to endure that which came in the fixed course\nof things. If the spirit of curiosity, the yearning for an active,\njoyous grasp of life, sometimes pierced through this placid temper,\nand stirred the blood of the adolescent members, they were persuaded\nby grave voices, of almost prophetic authority, to turn their hearts\ntowards “the Stillness and the Quietness.”\n\nIt was the pleasant custom of the community to arrive at the\nmeeting-house some fifteen or twenty minutes before the usual time of\nmeeting, and exchange quiet and kindly greetings before taking their\nplaces on the plain benches inside. As most of the families had lived\nduring the week on the solitude of their farms, they liked to see their\nneighbors' faces, and resolve, as it were, their sense of isolation into\nthe common atmosphere, before yielding to the assumed abstraction\nof their worship. In this preliminary meeting, also, the sexes were\ndivided, but rather from habit than any prescribed rule. They were\nalready in the vestibule of the sanctuary; their voices were subdued and\ntheir manner touched with a kind of reverence.\n\nIf the Londongrove Friends gathered together a few minutes earlier on\nthat September First-day; if the younger members looked more frequently\ntowards one of the gates leading into the meeting-house yard than\ntowards the other; and if Abraham Bradbury was the centre of a larger\ncircle of neighbors than Simon Pennock (although both sat side by\nside on the highest seat of the gallery),--the cause of these slight\ndeviations from the ordinary behavior of the gathering was generally\nknown. Abraham's son had died the previous Sixth-month, leaving a widow\nincapable of taking charge of his farm on the Street Road, which\nwas therefore offered for rent. It was not always easy to obtain a\nsatisfactory tenant in those days, and Abraham was not more relieved\nthan surprised on receiving an application from an unexpected quarter. A\nstrange Friend, of stately appearance, called upon him, bearing a letter\nfrom William Warner, in Adams County, together with a certificate from\na Monthly Meeting on Long Island. After inspecting the farm and making\nclose inquiries in regard to the people of the neighborhood, he accepted\nthe terms of rent, and had now, with his family, been three or four days\nin possession.\n\nIn this circumstance, it is true, there was nothing strange, and the\ninterest of the people sprang from some other particulars which had\ntranspired. The new-comer, Henry Donnelly by name, had offered, in place\nof the usual security, to pay the rent annually in advance; his\nspeech and manner were not, in all respects, those of Friends, and he\nacknowledged that he was of Irish birth; and moreover, some who had\npassed the wagons bearing his household goods had been struck by the\npeculiar patterns of the furniture piled upon them. Abraham Bradbury\nhad of course been present at the arrival, and the Friends upon the\nadjoining farms had kindly given their assistance, although it was\na busy time of the year. While, therefore, no one suspected that the\nfarmer could possibly accept a tenant of doubtful character, a general\nsentiment of curious expectancy went forth to meet the Donnelly family.\n\nEven the venerable Simon Pennock, who lived in the opposite part of the\ntownship, was not wholly free from the prevalent feeling. “Abraham,” he\nsaid, approaching his colleague, “I suppose thee has satisfied thyself\nthat the strange Friend is of good repute.”\n\nAbraham was assuredly satisfied of one thing--that the three hundred\nsilver dollars in his antiquated secretary at home were good and lawful\ncoin. We will not say that this fact disposed him to charity, but will\nonly testify that he answered thus:\n\n“I don't think we have any right to question the certificate from Islip,\nSimon; and William Warner's word (whom thee knows by hearsay) is that of\na good and honest man. Henry himself will stand ready to satisfy thee,\nif it is needful.”\n\nHere he turned to greet a tall, fresh-faced youth, who had quietly\njoined the group at the men's end of the meeting-house. He was\nnineteen, blue-eyed, and rosy, and a little embarrassed by the grave,\nscrutinizing, yet not unfriendly eyes fixed upon him.\n\n“Simon, this is Henry's oldest son, De Courcy,” said Abraham.\n\nSimon took the youth's hand, saying, “Where did thee get thy outlandish\nname?”\n\nThe young man colored, hesitated, and then said, in a low, firm voice,\n“It was my grandfather's name.”\n\nOne of the heavy carriages of the place and period, new and shiny, in\nspite of its sober colors, rolled into the yard. Abraham Bradbury and De\nCourcy Donnelly set forth side by side, to meet it.\n\nOut of it descended a tall, broad-shouldered figure--a man in the prime\nof life, whose ripe, aggressive vitality gave his rigid Quaker garb\nthe air of a military undress. His blue eyes seemed to laugh above the\nmeasured accents of his plain speech, and the close crop of his hair\ncould not hide its tendency to curl. A bearing expressive of energy and\nthe habit of command was not unusual in the sect, strengthening, but\nnot changing, its habitual mask; yet in Henry Donnelly this bearing\nsuggested--one could scarcely explain why--a different experience.\nDress and speech, in him, expressed condescension rather than fraternal\nequality.\n\nHe carefully assisted his wife to alight, and De Courcy led the horse to\nthe hitching-shed. Susan Donnelly was a still blooming woman of forty;\nher dress, of the plainest color, was yet of the richest texture; and\nher round, gentle, almost timid face looked forth like a girl's from the\nshadow of her scoop bonnet. While she was greeting Abraham Bradbury,\nthe two daughters, Sylvia and Alice, who had been standing shyly by\nthemselves on the edge of the group of women, came forward. The latter\nwas a model of the demure Quaker maiden; but Abraham experienced as much\nsurprise as was possible to his nature on observing Sylvia's costume.\nA light-blue dress, a dark-blue cloak, a hat with ribbons, and hair in\ncurls--what Friend of good standing ever allowed his daughter thus to\narray herself in the fashion of the world?\n\nHenry read the question in Abraham's face, and preferred not to answer\nit at that moment. Saying, “Thee must make me acquainted with the rest\nof our brethren,” he led the way back to the men's end. When he had\nbeen presented to the older members, it was time for them to assemble in\nmeeting.\n\nThe people were again quietly startled when Henry Donnelly deliberately\nmounted to the third and highest bench facing them, and sat down beside\nAbraham and Simon. These two retained, possibly with some little inward\nexertion, the composure of their faces, and the strange Friend became\nlike unto them. His hands were clasped firmly in his lap; his full,\ndecided lips were set together, and his eyes gazed into vacancy from\nunder the broad brim. De Courcy had removed his hat on entering the\nhouse, but, meeting his father's eyes, replaced it suddenly, with a\nslight blush.\n\nWhen Simon Pennock and Ruth Treadwell had spoken the thoughts which had\ncome to them in the stillness, the strange Friend arose. Slowly, with\nfrequent pauses, as if waiting for the guidance of the Spirit, and with\nthat inward voice which falls so naturally into the measure of a chant,\nhe urged upon his hearers the necessity of seeking the Light and walking\ntherein. He did not always employ the customary phrases, but neither did\nhe seem to speak the lower language of logic and reason; while his tones\nwere so full and mellow that they gave, with every slowly modulated\nsentence, a fresh satisfaction to the ear. Even his broad a's and the\nstrong roll of his r's verified the rumor of his foreign birth, did not\ndetract from the authority of his words. The doubts which had preceded\nhim somehow melted away in his presence, and he came forth, after the\nmeeting had been dissolved by the shaking of hands, an accepted tenant\nof the high seat.\n\nThat evening, the family were alone in their new home. The plain\nrush-bottomed chairs and sober carpet, in contrast with the dark, solid\nmahogany table, and the silver branched candle-stick which stood upon\nit, hinted of former wealth and present loss; and something of the same\ncontrast was reflected in the habits of the inmates. While the father,\nseated in a stately arm-chair, read aloud to his wife and children,\nSylvia's eyes rested on a guitar-case in the corner, and her fingers\nabsently adjusted themselves to the imaginary frets. De Courcy twisted\nhis neck as if the straight collar of his coat were a bad fit, and\nHenry, the youngest boy, nodded drowsily from time to time.\n\n“There, my lads and lasses!” said Henry Donnelly, as he closed the book,\n“now we're plain farmers at last,--and the plainer the better, since it\nmust be. There's only one thing wanting--”\n\nHe paused; and Sylvia, looking up with a bright, arch determination,\nanswered: “It's too late now, father,--they have seen me as one of\nthe world's people, as I meant they should. When it is once settled as\nsomething not to be helped, it will give us no trouble.”\n\n“Faith, Sylvia!” exclaimed De Courcy, “I almost wish I had kept you\ncompany.”\n\n“Don't be impatient, my boy,” said the mother, gently. “Think of the\nvexations we have had, and what a rest this life will be!”\n\n“Think, also,” the father added, “that I have the heaviest work to do,\nand that thou'lt reap the most of what may come of it. Don't carry the\nold life to a land where it's out of place. We must be what we seem to\nbe, every one of us!”\n\n“So we will!” said Sylvia, rising from her seat,--“I, as well as the\nrest. It was what I said in the beginning, you--no, THEE knows, father.\nSomebody must be interpreter when the time comes; somebody must remember\nwhile the rest of you are forgetting. Oh, I shall be talked about, and\nset upon, and called hard names; it won't be so easy. Stay where you\nare, De Courcy; that coat will fit sooner than you think.”\n\nHer brother lifted his shoulders and made a grimace. “I've an\nunlucky name, it seems,” said he. “The old fellow--I mean Friend\nSimon--pronounced it outlandish. Couldn't I change it to Ezra or\nAdonijah?”\n\n“Boy, boy--”\n\n“Don't be alarmed, father. It will soon be as Sylvia says; thee's right,\nand mother is right. I'll let Sylvia keep my memory, and start fresh\nfrom here. We must into the field to-morrow, Hal and I. There's no need\nof a collar at the plough-tail.”\n\nThey went to rest, and on the morrow not only the boys, but their father\nwere in the field. Shrewd, quick, and strong, they made available what\nthey knew of farming operations, and disguised much of their ignorance,\nwhile they learned. Henry Donnelly's first public appearance had made\na strong public impression in his favor, which the voice of the older\nFriends soon stamped as a settled opinion. His sons did their share, by\nthe amiable, yielding temper they exhibited, in accommodating themselves\nto the manners and ways of the people. The graces which came from a\nbetter education, possibly, more refined associations, gave them an\nattraction, which was none the less felt because it was not understood,\nto the simple-minded young men who worked with the hired hands in their\nfathers' fields. If the Donnelly family had not been accustomed, in\nformer days, to sit at the same table with laborers in shirt-sleeves,\nand be addressed by the latter in fraternal phrase, no little\nawkwardnesses or hesitations betrayed the fact. They were anxious to\nmake their naturalization complete, and it soon became so.\n\nThe “strange Friend” was now known in Londongrove by the familiar\nname of “Henry.” He was a constant attendant at meeting, not only on\nFirst-days, but also on Fourth-days, and whenever he spoke his words\nwere listened to with the reverence due to one who was truly led towards\nthe Light. This respect kept at bay the curiosity that might still have\nlingered in some minds concerning his antecedent life. It was known\nthat he answered Simon Pennock, who had ventured to approach him with a\ndirect question, in these words:\n\n“Thee knows, Friend Simon, that sometimes a seal is put upon our mouths\nfor a wise purpose. I have learned not to value the outer life except\nin so far as it is made the manifestation of the inner life, and I\nonly date my own from the time when I was brought to a knowledge of the\ntruth. It is not pleasant to me to look upon what went before; but\na season may come when it shall be lawful for me to declare all\nthings--nay, when it shall be put upon me as a duty.\n\n“Thee must suffer me to wait the call.”\n\nAfter this there was nothing more to be said. The family was on terms\nof quiet intimacy with the neighbors; and even Sylvia, in spite of her\ndefiant eyes and worldly ways, became popular among the young men\nand maidens. She touched her beloved guitar with a skill which seemed\nmarvellous to the latter; and when it was known that her refusal to\nenter the sect arose from her fondness for the prohibited instrument,\nshe found many apologists among them. She was not set upon, and called\nhard names, as she had anticipated. It is true that her father, when\nappealed to by the elders, shook his head and said, “It is a cross to\nus!”--but he had been known to remain in the room while she sang “Full\nhigh in Kilbride,” and the keen light which arose in his eyes was\nneither that of sorrow nor anger.\n\nAt the end of their first year of residence the farm presented evidences\nof much more orderly and intelligent management than at first, although\nthe adjoining neighbors were of the opinion that the Donnellys had\nhardly made their living out of it. Friend Henry, nevertheless, was\nready with the advance rent, and his bills were promptly paid. He\nwas close at a bargain, which was considered rather a merit than\notherwise,--and almost painfully exact in observing the strict letter of\nit, when made.\n\nAs time passed by, and the family became a permanent part and parcel\nof the remote community, wearing its peaceful color and breathing\nits untroubled atmosphere, nothing occurred to disturb the esteem and\nrespect which its members enjoyed. From time to time the postmaster at\nthe corner delivered to Henry Donnelly a letter from New York, always\naddressed in the same hand. The first which arrived had an “Esq.” added\nto the name, but this “compliment” (as the Friends termed it) soon\nceased. Perhaps the official may have vaguely wondered whether there was\nany connection between the occasional absence of Friend Henry--not at\nYearly-Meeting time--and these letters. If he had been a visitor at the\nfarm-house he might have noticed variations in the moods of its inmates,\nwhich must have arisen from some other cause than the price of stock or\nthe condition of the crops. Outside of the family circle, however, they\nwere serenely reticent.\n\nIn five or six years, when De Courcy had grown to be a hale, handsome\nman of twenty-four, and as capable of conducting a farm as any to the\ntownship born, certain aberrations from the strict line of discipline\nbegan to be rumored. He rode a gallant horse, dressed a little more\nelegantly than his membership prescribed, and his unusually high,\nstraight collar took a knack of falling over. Moreover, he was\nfrequently seen to ride up the Street Road, in the direction of Fagg's\nManor, towards those valleys where the brick Presbyterian church\ndisplaces the whitewashed Quaker meeting-house.\n\nHad Henry Donnelly not occupied so high a seat, and exercised such\nan acknowledged authority in the sect, he might sooner have received\ncounsel, or proffers of sympathy, as the case might be; but he heard\nnothing until the rumors of De Courcy's excursions took a more definite\nform.\n\nBut one day, Abraham Bradbury, after discussing some Monthly-Meeting\nmatters, suddenly asked: “Is this true that I hear, Henry,--that thy son\nDe Courcy keeps company with one of the Alison girls?”\n\n“Who says that?” Henry asked, in a sharp voice.\n\n“Why, it's the common talk! Surely, thee's heard of it before?”\n\n“No!”\n\nHenry set his lips together in a manner which Abraham understood.\nConsidering that he had fully performed his duty, he said no more.\n\nThat evening, Sylvia, who had been gently thrumming to herself at the\nwindow, began singing “Bonnie Peggie Alison.” Her father looked at De\nCourcy, who caught his glance, then lowered his eyes, and turned to\nleave the room.\n\n“Stop, De Courcy,” said the former; “I've heard a piece of news about\nthee to-day, which I want thee to make clear.”\n\n“Shall I go, father?” asked Sylvia.\n\n“No; thee may stay to give De Courcy his memory. I think he is beginning\nto need it. I've learned which way he rides on Seventh-day evenings.”\n\n“Father, I am old enough to choose my way,” said De Courcy.\n\n“But no such ways NOW, boy! Has thee clean forgotten? This was among\nthe things upon which we agreed, and you all promised to keep watch and\nguard over yourselves. I had my misgivings then, but for five years I've\ntrusted you, and now, when the time of probation is so nearly over--”\n\nHe hesitated, and De Courcy, plucking up courage, spoke again. With\na strong effort the young man threw off the yoke of a self-taught\nrestraint, and asserted his true nature. “Has O'Neil written?” he asked.\n\n“Not yet.”\n\n“Then, father,” he continued, “I prefer the certainty of my present life\nto the uncertainty of the old. I will not dissolve my connection with\nthe Friends by a shock which might give thee trouble; but I will slowly\nwork away from them. Notice will be taken of my ways; there will be\nfamily visitations, warnings, and the usual routine of discipline, so\nthat when I marry Margaret Alison, nobody will be surprised at my being\nread out of meeting. I shall soon be twenty-five, father, and this thing\nhas gone on about as long as I can bear it. I must decide to be either a\nman or a milksop.”\n\nThe color rose to Henry Donnelly's cheeks, and his eyes flashed, but he\nshowed no signs of anger. He moved to De Courcy's side and laid his hand\nupon his shoulder.\n\n“Patience, my boy!” he said. “It's the old blood, and I might have known\nit would proclaim itself. Suppose I were to shut my eyes to thy ridings,\nand thy merry-makings, and thy worldly company. So far I might go; but\nthe girl is no mate for thee. If O'Neil is alive, we are sure to hear\nfrom him soon; and in three years, at the utmost, if the Lord favors\nus, the end will come. How far has it gone with thy courting? Surely,\nsurely, not too far to withdraw, at least under the plea of my\nprohibition?”\n\nDe Courcy blushed, but firmly met his father's eyes. “I have spoken\nto her,” he replied, “and it is not the custom of our family to break\nplighted faith.”\n\n“Thou art our cross, not Sylvia. Go thy ways now. I will endeavor to\nseek for guidance.”\n\n“Sylvia,” said the father, when De Courcy had left the room, “what is to\nbe the end of this?”\n\n“Unless we hear from O'Neil, father, I am afraid it cannot be prevented.\nDe Courcy has been changing for a year past; I am only surprised that\nyou did not sooner notice it. What I said in jest has become serious\ntruth; he has already half forgotten. We might have expected, in the\nbeginning, that one of two things would happen: either he would become\na plodding Quaker farmer or take to his present courses. Which would be\nworse, when this life is over,--if that time ever comes?”\n\nSylvia sighed, and there was a weariness in her voice which did not\nescape her father's ear. He walked up and down the room with a troubled\nair. She sat down, took the guitar upon her lap, and began to sing\nthe verse, commencing, “Erin, my country, though sad and forsaken,”\n when--perhaps opportunely--Susan Donnelly entered the room.\n\n“Eh, lass!” said Henry, slipping his arm around his wife's waist, “art\nthou tired yet? Have I been trying thy patience, as I have that of\nthe children? Have there been longings kept from me, little rebellions\ncrushed, battles fought that I supposed were over?”\n\n“Not by me, Henry,” was her cheerful answer. “I have never have been\nhappier than in these quiet ways with thee. I've been thinking, what if\nsomething has happened, and the letters cease to come? And it has seemed\nto me--now that the boys are as good farmers as any, and Alice is such a\ntidy housekeeper--that we could manage very well without help. Only for\nthy sake, Henry: I fear it would be a terrible disappointment to thee.\nOr is thee as accustomed to the high seat as I to my place on the\nwomen's side?”\n\n“No!” he answered emphatically. “The talk with De Courcy has set my\nquiet Quaker blood in motion. The boy is more than half right; I am sure\nSylvia thinks so too. What could I expect? He has no birthright, and\ndidn't begin his task, as I did, after the bravery of youth was over.\nIt took six generations to establish the serenity and content of our\nbrethren here, and the dress we wear don't give us the nature. De Courcy\nis tired of the masquerade, and Sylvia is tired of seeing it. Thou, my\nlittle Susan, who wert so timid at first, puttest us all to shame now!”\n\n“I think I was meant for it,--Alice, and Henry, and I,” said she.\n\nNo outward change in Henry Donnelly's demeanor betrayed this or any\nother disturbance at home. There were repeated consultations between the\nfather and son, but they led to no satisfactory conclusion. De Courcy\nwas sincerely attached to the pretty Presbyterian maiden, and found\nlivelier society in her brothers and cousins than among the grave,\nawkward Quaker youths of Londongrove.\n\nWith the occasional freedom from restraint there awoke in him a desire\nfor independence--a thirst for the suppressed license of youth. His\nnew acquaintances were accustomed to a rigid domestic regime, but of a\ndifferent character, and they met on a common ground of rebellion. Their\naberrations, it is true, were not of a very formidable character, and\nneed not have been guarded but for the severe conventionalities of both\nsects. An occasional fox-chase, horse-race, or a “stag party” at some\noutlying tavern, formed the sum of their dissipation; they sang, danced\nreels, and sometimes ran into little excesses through the stimulating\nsense of the trespass they were committing.\n\nBy and by reports of certain of these performances were brought to\nthe notice of the Londongrove Friends, and, with the consent of\nHenry Donnelly himself, De Courcy received a visit of warning and\nremonstrance. He had foreseen the probability of such a visit and\nwas prepared. He denied none of the charges brought against him, and\naccepted the grave counsel offered, simply stating that his nature was\nnot yet purified and chastened; he was aware he was not walking in the\nLight; he believed it to be a troubled season through which he must\nneeds pass. His frankness, as he was shrewd enough to guess, was\na source of perplexity to the elders; it prevented them from\nexcommunicating him without further probation, while it left him free\nto indulge in further recreations.\n\nSome months passed away, and the absence from which Henry Donnelly\nalways returned with a good supply of ready money did not take place.\nThe knowledge of farming which his sons had acquired now came into play.\nIt was necessary to exercise both skill and thrift in order to keep up\nthe liberal footing upon which the family had lived; for each member of\nit was too proud to allow the community to suspect the change in their\ncircumstances. De Courcy, retained more than ever at home, and bound\nto steady labor, was man enough to subdue his impatient spirit for the\ntime; but he secretly determined that with the first change for the\nbetter he would follow the fate he had chosen for himself.\n\nLate in the fall came the opportunity for which he had longed. One\nevening he brought home a letter, in the well-known handwriting. His\nfather opened and read it in silence.\n\n“Well, father?” he said.\n\n“A former letter was lost, it seems. This should have come in the\nspring; it is only the missing sum.”\n\n“Does O'Neil fix any time?”\n\n“No; but he hopes to make a better report next year.”\n\n“Then, father,” said De Courcy, “it is useless for me to wait longer; I\nam satisfied as it is. I should not have given up Margaret in any case;\nbut now, since thee can live with Henry's help, I shall claim her.”\n\n“MUST it be, De Courcy?”\n\n“It must.”\n\nBut it was not to be. A day or two afterwards the young man, on his\nmettled horse, set off up the Street Road, feeling at last that the\nfortune and the freedom of his life were approaching. He had become, in\nhabits and in feelings, one of the people, and the relinquishment of the\nhope in which his father still indulged brought him a firmer courage, a\nmore settled content. His sweetheart's family was in good circumstances;\nbut, had she been poor, he felt confident of his power to make and\nsecure for her a farmer's home. To the past--whatever it might have\nbeen--he said farewell, and went carolling some cheerful ditty, to look\nupon the face of his future.\n\nThat night a country wagon slowly drove up to Henry Donnelly's door. The\nthree men who accompanied it hesitated before they knocked, and, when\nthe door was opened, looked at each other with pale, sad faces, before\neither spoke. No cries followed the few words that were said, but\nsilently, swiftly, a room was made ready, while the men lifted from the\nstraw and carried up stairs an unconscious figure, the arms of which\nhung down with a horrible significance as they moved. He was not dead,\nfor the heart beat feebly and slowly; but all efforts to restore his\nconsciousness were in vain. There was concussion of the brain the\nphysician said. He had been thrown from his horse, probably alighting\nupon his head, as there were neither fractures nor external wounds.\nAll that night and next day the tenderest, the most unwearied care was\nexerted to call back the flickering gleam of life. The shock had been\ntoo great; his deadly torpor deepened into death.\n\nIn their time of trial and sorrow the family received the fullest\nsympathy, the kindliest help, from the whole neighborhood. They had\nnever before so fully appreciated the fraternal character of the society\nwhereof they were members. The plain, plodding people living on the\nadjoining farms became virtually their relatives and fellow-mourners.\nAll the external offices demanded by the sad occasion were performed for\nthem, and other eyes than their own shed tears of honest grief over De\nCourcy's coffin. All came to the funeral, and even Simon Pennock, in\nthe plain yet touching words which he spoke beside the grave, forgot the\nyoung man's wandering from the Light, in the recollection of his frank,\ngenerous, truthful nature.\n\nIf the Donnellys had sometimes found the practical equality of life in\nLondongrove a little repellent they were now gratefully moved by the\ndelicate and refined ways in which the sympathy of the people sought to\nexpress itself. The better qualities of human nature always develop a\ntemporary good-breeding. Wherever any of the family went, they saw the\nreflection of their own sorrow; and a new spirit informed to their eyes\nthe quiet pastoral landscapes.\n\nIn their life at home there was little change. Abraham Bradbury had\ninsisted on sending his favorite grandson, Joel, a youth of twenty-two,\nto take De Courcy's place for a few months. He was a shy quiet creature,\nwith large brown eyes like a fawn's, and young Henry Donnelly and he\nbecame friends at once. It was believed that he would inherit the\nfarm at his grandfather's death; but he was as subservient to Friend\nDonnelly's wishes in regard to the farming operations as if the latter\nheld the fee of the property. His coming did not fill the terrible gap\nwhich De Courcy's death had made, but seemed to make it less constantly\nand painfully evident.\n\nSusan Donnelly soon remarked a change, which she could neither clearly\ndefine nor explain to herself, both in her husband and in their daughter\nSylvia. The former, although in public he preserved the same grave,\nstately face,--its lines, perhaps, a little more deeply marked,--seemed\nto be devoured by an internal unrest. His dreams were of the old times:\nwords and names long unused came from his lips as he slept by her side.\nAlthough he bore his grief with more strength than she had hoped, he\ngrew nervous and excitable,--sometimes unreasonably petulant, sometimes\ngay to a pitch which impressed her with pain. When the spring came\naround, and the mysterious correspondence again failed, as in the\nprevious year, his uneasiness increased. He took his place on the high\nseat on First-days, as usual, but spoke no more.\n\nSylvia, on the other hand, seemed to have wholly lost her proud,\nimpatient character. She went to meeting much more frequently than\nformerly, busied herself more actively about household matters,\nand ceased to speak of the uncertain contingency which had been so\nconstantly present in her thoughts. In fact, she and her father had\nchanged places. She was now the one who preached patience, who held\nbefore them all the bright side of their lot, who brought Margaret\nAlison to the house and justified her dead brother's heart to his\nfather's, and who repeated to the latter, in his restless moods, “De\nCourcy foresaw the truth, and we must all in the end decide as he did.”\n\n“Can THEE do it, Sylvia?” her father would ask.\n\n“I believe I have done it already,” she said. “If it seems difficult,\npray consider how much later I begin my work. I have had all your\nmemories in charge, and now I must not only forget for myself, but for\nyou as well.”\n\nIndeed, as the spring and summer months came and went, Sylvia evidently\ngrew stronger in her determination. The fret of her idle force was\nallayed, and her content increased as she saw and performed the possible\nduties of her life. Perhaps her father might have caught something\nof her spirit, but for his anxiety in regard to the suspended\ncorrespondence. He wearied himself in guesses, which all ended in the\nsimple fact that, to escape embarrassment, the rent must again be saved\nfrom the earnings of the farm.\n\nThe harvests that year were bountiful; wheat, barley, and oats stood\nthick and heavy in the fields. No one showed more careful thrift or more\ncheerful industry than young Joel Bradbury, and the family felt that\nmuch of the fortune of their harvest was owing to him.\n\nOn the first day after the crops had been securely housed, all went\nto meeting, except Sylvia. In the walled graveyard the sod was already\ngreen over De Courcy's unmarked mound, but Alice had planted a little\nrose-tree at the head, and she and her mother always visited the spot\nbefore taking their seats on the women's side. The meeting-house was\nvery full that day, as the busy season of the summer was over, and the\nhorses of those who lived at a distance had no longer such need of rest.\n\nIt was a sultry forenoon, and the windows and doors of the building were\nopen. The humming of insects was heard in the silence, and broken lights\nand shadows of the poplar-leaves were sprinkled upon the steps and\nsills. Outside there were glimpses of quiet groves and orchards, and\nblue fragments of sky,--no more semblance of life in the external\nlandscape than there was in the silent meeting within. Some quarter of\nan hour before the shaking of hands took place, the hoofs of a horse\nwere heard in the meeting-house yard--the noise of a smart trot on the\nturf, suddenly arrested.\n\nThe boys pricked up their ears at this unusual sound, and stole glances\nat each other when they imagined themselves unseen by the awful faces in\nthe gallery. Presently those nearest the door saw a broader shadow fall\nover those flickering upon the stone. A red face appeared for a moment,\nand was then drawn back out of sight. The shadow advanced and receded,\nin a state of peculiar restlessness. Sometimes the end of a riding-whip\nwas visible, sometimes the corner of a coarse gray coat. The boys who\nnoticed these apparitions were burning with impatience, but they dared\nnot leave their seats until Abraham Bradbury had reached his hand to\nHenry Donnelly.\n\nThen they rushed out. The mysterious personage was still beside the\ndoor, leaning against the wall. He was a short, thick-set man of fifty,\nwith red hair, round gray eyes, a broad pug nose, and projecting mouth.\nHe wore a heavy gray coat, despite the heat, and a waistcoat with\nmany brass buttons; also corduroy breeches and riding boots. When they\nappeared, he started forward with open mouth and eyes, and stared wildly\nin their faces. They gathered around the poplar-trunks, and waited with\nsome uneasiness to see what would follow.\n\nSlowly and gravely, with the half-broken ban of silence still hanging\nover them, the people issued from the house. The strange man stood,\nleaning forward, and seemed to devour each, in turn, with his eager\neyes. After the young men came the fathers of families, and lastly the\nold men from the gallery seats. Last of these came Henry Donnelly.\nIn the meantime, all had seen and wondered at the waiting figure; its\nattitude was too intense and self-forgetting to be misinterpreted. The\ngreetings and remarks were suspended until the people had seen for whom\nthe man waited, and why.\n\nHenry Donnelly had no sooner set his foot upon the door-step than,\nwith something between a shout and a howl, the stranger darted forward,\nseized his hand, and fell upon one knee, crying: “O my lord! my lord!\nGlory be to God that I've found ye at last!”\n\nIf these words burst like a bomb on the ears of the people, what was\ntheir consternation when Henry Donnelly exclaimed, “The Divel! Jack\nO'Neil, can that be you?”\n\n“It's me, meself, my lord! When we heard the letters went wrong last\nyear, I said 'I'll trust no such good news to their blasted mail-posts:\nI'll go meself and carry it to his lordship,--if it is t'other side o'\nthe say. Him and my lady and all the children went, and sure I can go\ntoo. And as I was the one that went with you from Dunleigh Castle, I'll\ngo back with you to that same, for it stands awaitin', and blessed be\nthe day that sees you back in your ould place!”\n\n“All clear, Jack? All mine again?”\n\n“You may believe it, my lord! And money in the chest beside. But where's\nmy lady, bless her sweet face! Among yon women, belike, and you'll help\nme to find her, for it's herself must have the news next, and then the\nyoung master--”\n\nWith that word Henry Donnelly awoke to a sense of time and place. He\nfound himself within a ring of staring, wondering, scandalized eyes. He\nmet them boldly, with a proud, though rather grim smile, took hold of\nO'Neil's arm and led him towards the women's end of the house, where the\nsight of Susan in her scoop bonnet so moved the servant's heart that he\nmelted into tears. Both husband and wife were eager to get home and\nhear O'Neil's news in private; so they set out at once in their plain\ncarriage, followed by the latter on horseback. As for the Friends, they\nwent home in a state of bewilderment.\n\nAlice Donnelly, with her brother Henry and Joel Bradbury, returned\non foot. The two former remembered O'Neil, and, although they had not\nwitnessed his first interview with their father, they knew enough of the\nfamily history to surmise his errand. Joel was silent and troubled.\n\n“Alice, I hope it doesn't mean that we are going back, don't you?” said\nHenry.\n\n“Yes,” she answered, and said no more.\n\nThey took a foot-path across the fields, and reached the farm-house\nat the same time with the first party. As they opened the door Sylvia\ndescended the staircase dressed in a rich shimmering brocade, with\na necklace of amethysts around her throat. To their eyes, so long\naccustomed to the absence of positive color, she was completely\ndazzling. There was a new color on her cheeks, and her eyes seemed\nlarger and brighter. She made a stately courtesy, and held open the\nparlor door.\n\n“Welcome, Lord Henry Dunleigh, of Dunleigh Castle!” she cried; “welcome,\nLady Dunleigh!”\n\nHer father kissed her on the forehead. “Now give us back our memories,\nSylvia!” he said, exultingly.\n\nSusan Donnelly sank into a chair, overcome by the mixed emotions of the\nmoment.\n\n“Come in, my faithful Jack! Unpack thy portmanteau of news, for I\nsee thou art bursting to show it; let us have every thing from\nthe beginning. Wife, it's a little too much for thee, coming so\nunexpectedly. Set out the wine, Alice!”\n\nThe decanter was placed upon the table. O'Neil filled a tumbler to the\nbrim, lifted it high, made two or three hoarse efforts to speak, and\nthen walked away to the window, where he drank in silence. This little\nincident touched the family more than the announcement of their good\nfortune. Henry Donnelly's feverish exultation subsided: he sat down with\na grave, thoughtful face, while his wife wept quietly beside him. Sylvia\nstood waiting with an abstracted air; Alice removed her mother's bonnet\nand shawl; and Henry and Joel, seated together at the farther end of the\nroom, looked on in silent anticipation.\n\nO'Neil's story was long, and frequently interrupted. He had been Lord\nDunleigh's steward in better days, as his father had been to the old\nlord, and was bound to the family by the closest ties of interest\nand affection. When the estates became so encumbered that either an\nimmediate change or a catastrophe was inevitable, he had been taken\ninto his master's confidence concerning the plan which had first been\nproposed in jest, and afterwards adopted in earnest.\n\nThe family must leave Dunleigh Castle for a period of probably eight or\nten years, and seek some part of the world where their expenses could be\nreduced to the lowest possible figure. In Germany or Italy there would\nbe the annoyance of a foreign race and language, of meeting of tourists\nbelonging to the circle in which they had moved, a dangerous idleness\nfor their sons, and embarrassing restrictions for their daughters. On\nthe other hand, the suggestion to emigrate to America and become Quakers\nduring their exile offered more advantages the more they considered it.\nIt was original in character; it offered them economy, seclusion,\nentire liberty of action inside the limits of the sect, the best\nmoral atmosphere for their children, and an occupation which would not\ndeteriorate what was best in their blood and breeding.\n\nHow Lord Dunleigh obtained admission into the sect as plain Henry\nDonnelly is a matter of conjecture with the Londongrove Friends. The\ndeception which had been practised upon them--although it was perhaps\nless complete than they imagined--left a soreness of feeling behind\nit. The matter was hushed up after the departure of the family, and one\nmight now live for years in the neighborhood without hearing the story.\nHow the shrewd plan was carried out by Lord Dunleigh and his family,\nwe have already learned. O'Neil, left on the estate, in the north of\nIreland, did his part with equal fidelity. He not only filled up the\ngaps made by his master's early profuseness, but found means to move the\nsympathies of a cousin of the latter--a rich, eccentric old bachelor,\nwho had long been estranged by a family quarrel. To this cousin he\nfinally confided the character of the exile, and at a lucky time; for\nthe cousin's will was altered in Lord Dunleigh's favor, and he died\nbefore his mood of reconciliation passed away. Now, the estate was not\nonly unencumbered, but there was a handsome surplus in the hands of the\nDublin bankers. The family might return whenever they chose, and there\nwould be a festival to welcome them, O'Neil said, such as Dunleigh\nCastle had never known since its foundations were laid.\n\n“Let us go at once!” said Sylvia, when he had concluded his tale. “No\nmore masquerading,--I never knew until to-day how much I have hated it!\nI will not say that your plan was not a sensible one, father; but I wish\nit might have been carried out with more honor to ourselves. Since De\nCourcy's death I have begun to appreciate our neighbors: I was resigned\nto become one of these people had our luck gone the other way. Will they\ngive us any credit for goodness and truth, I wonder? Yes, in mother's\ncase, and Alice's; and I believe both of them would give up Dunleigh\nCastle for this little farm.”\n\n“Then,” her father exclaimed, “it IS time that we should return, and\nwithout delay. But thee wrongs us somewhat, Sylvia: it has not all been\nmasquerading. We have become the servants, rather than the masters, of\nour own parts, and shall live a painful and divided life until we get\nback in our old place. I fear me it will always be divided for thee,\nwife, and Alice and Henry. If I am subdued by the element which I only\nmeant to assume, how much more deeply must it have wrought in your\nnatures! Yes, Sylvia is right, we must get away at once. To-morrow we\nmust leave Londongrove forever!”\n\nHe had scarcely spoken, when a new surprise fell upon the family.\nJoel Bradbury arose and walked forward, as if thrust by an emotion so\npowerful that it transformed his whole being. He seemed to forget every\nthing but Alice Donnelly's presence. His soft brown eyes were fixed on\nher face with an expression of unutterable tenderness and longing. He\ncaught her by the hands. “Alice, O, Alice!” burst from his lips; “you\nare not going to leave me?”\n\nThe flush in the girl's sweet face faded into a deadly paleness. A\nmoan came from her lips; her head dropped, and she would have fallen,\nswooning, from the chair had not Joel knelt at her feet and caught her\nupon his breast.\n\nFor a moment there was silence in the room.\n\nPresently, Sylvia, all her haughtiness gone, knelt beside the young man,\nand took her sister from his arms. “Joel, my poor, dear friend,” she\nsaid, “I am sorry that the last, worst mischief we have done must fall\nupon you.”\n\nJoel covered his face with his hands, and convulsively uttered the\nwords, “MUST she go?”\n\nThen Henry Donnelly--or, rather, Lord Dunleigh, as we must now call\nhim--took the young man's hand. He was profoundly moved; his strong\nvoice trembled, and his words came slowly. “I will not appeal to thy\nheart, Joel,” he said, “for it would not hear me now.\n\n“But thou hast heard all our story, and knowest that we must leave these\nparts, never to return. We belong to another station and another mode of\nlife than yours, and it must come to us as a good fortune that our time\nof probation is at an end. Bethink thee, could we leave our darling\nAlice behind us, parted as if by the grave? Nay, could we rob her of the\nlife to which she is born--of her share in our lives? On the other hand,\ncould we take thee with us into relations where thee would always be a\nstranger, and in which a nature like thine has no place? This is a case\nwhere duty speaks clearly, though so hard, so very hard, to follow.”\n\nHe spoke tenderly, but inflexibly, and Joel felt that his fate was\npronounced. When Alice had somewhat revived, and was taken to another\nroom, he stumbled blindly out of the house, made his way to the barn,\nand there flung himself upon the harvest-sheaves which, three days\nbefore, he had bound with such a timid, delicious hope working in his\narm.\n\nThe day which brought such great fortune had thus a sad and troubled\ntermination. It was proposed that the family should start for\nPhiladelphia on the morrow, leaving O'Neil to pack up and remove such\nfurniture as they wished to retain; but Susan, Lady Dunleigh, could not\nforsake the neighborhood without a parting visit to the good friends who\nhad mourned with her over her firstborn; and Sylvia was with her in this\nwish. So two more days elapsed, and then the Dunleighs passed down the\nStreet Road, and the plain farm-house was gone from their eyes\nforever. Two grieved over the loss of their happy home; one was almost\nbroken-hearted; and the remaining two felt that the trouble of the\npresent clouded all their happiness in the return to rank and fortune.\n\nThey went, and they never came again. An account of the great festival\nat Dunleigh Castle reached Londongrove two years later, through an Irish\nlaborer, who brought to Joel Bradbury a letter of recommendation signed\n“Dunleigh.” Joel kept the man upon his farm, and the two preserved the\nmemory of the family long after the neighborhood had ceased to speak\nof it. Joel never married; he still lives in the house where the great\nsorrow of his life befell.\n\nHis head is gray, and his face deeply wrinkled; but when he lifts the\nshy lids of his soft brown eyes, I fancy I can see in their tremulous\ndepths the lingering memory of his love for Alice Dunleigh.\n\n\n\n\nJACOB FLINT'S JOURNEY.\n\n\nIf there ever was a man crushed out of all courage, all self-reliance,\nall comfort in life, it was Jacob Flint. Why this should have been,\nneither he nor any one else could have explained; but so it was. On the\nday that he first went to school, his shy, frightened face marked him as\nfair game for the rougher and stronger boys, and they subjected him to\nall those exquisite refinements of torture which boys seem to get by\nthe direct inspiration of the Devil. There was no form of their bullying\nmeanness or the cowardice of their brutal strength which he did not\nexperience. He was born under a fading or falling star,--the inheritor\nof some anxious or unhappy mood of his parents, which gave its fast\ncolor to the threads out of which his innocent being was woven.\n\nEven the good people of the neighborhood, never accustomed to look below\nthe externals of appearance and manner, saw in his shrinking face and\nawkward motions only the signs of a cringing, abject soul.\n\n“You'll be no more of a man than Jake Flint!” was the reproach which\nmany a farmer addressed to his dilatory boy; and thus the parents, one\nand all, came to repeat the sins of the children.\n\nIf, therefore, at school and “before folks,” Jacob's position was always\nuncomfortable and depressing, it was little more cheering at home. His\nparents, as all the neighbors believed, had been unhappily married, and,\nthough the mother died in his early childhood, his father remained a\nmoody, unsocial man, who rarely left his farm except on the 1st of April\nevery year, when he went to the county town for the purpose of paying\nthe interest upon a mortgage. The farm lay in a hollow between two\nhills, separated from the road by a thick wood, and the chimneys of the\nlonely old house looked in vain for a neighbor-smoke when they began to\ngrow warm of a morning.\n\nBeyond the barn and under the northern hill there was a log\ntenant-house, in which dwelt a negro couple, who, in the course of years\nhad become fixtures on the place and almost partners in it. Harry,\nthe man, was the medium by which Samuel Flint kept up his necessary\nintercourse with the world beyond the valley; he took the horses to the\nblacksmith, the grain to the mill, the turkeys to market, and through\nhis hands passed all the incomings and outgoings of the farm, except\nthe annual interest on the mortgage. Sally, his wife, took care of the\nhousehold, which, indeed, was a light and comfortable task, since the\ntable was well supplied for her own sake, and there was no sharp eye\nto criticise her sweeping, dusting, and bed-making. The place had a\nforlorn, tumble-down aspect, quite in keeping with its lonely situation;\nbut perhaps this very circumstance flattered the mood of its silent,\nmelancholy owner and his unhappy son.\n\nIn all the neighborhood there was but one person with whom Jacob felt\ncompletely at ease--but one who never joined in the general habit of\nmaking his name the butt of ridicule or contempt. This was Mrs. Ann\nPardon, the hearty, active wife of Farmer Robert Pardon, who lived\nnearly a mile farther down the brook. Jacob had won her good-will\nby some neighborly services, something so trifling, indeed, that the\nthought of a favor conferred never entered his mind. Ann Pardon saw that\nit did not; she detected a streak of most unconscious goodness under his\nuncouth, embarrassed ways, and she determined to cultivate it. No little\ntact was required, however, to coax the wild, forlorn creature into\nso much confidence as she desired to establish; but tact is a native\nquality of the heart no less than a social acquirement, and so she did\nthe very thing necessary without thinking much about it.\n\nRobert Pardon discovered by and by that Jacob was a steady, faithful\nhand in the harvest-field at husking-time, or whenever any extra labor\nwas required, and Jacob's father made no objection to his earning\na penny in this way; and so he fell into the habit of spending his\nSaturday evenings at the Pardon farm-house, at first to talk over\nmatters of work, and finally because it had become a welcome relief from\nhis dreary life at home.\n\nNow it happened that on a Saturday in the beginning of haying-time, the\nvillage tailor sent home by Harry a new suit of light summer clothes,\nfor which Jacob had been measured a month before. After supper he tried\nthem on, the day's work being over, and Sally's admiration was so loud\nand emphatic that he felt himself growing red even to the small of his\nback.\n\n“Now, don't go for to take 'em off, Mr. Jake,” said she. “I spec' you're\ngwine down to Pardon's, and so you jist keep 'em on to show 'em all how\nnice you KIN look.”\n\nThe same thought had already entered Jacob's mind. Poor fellow! It was\nthe highest form of pleasure of which he had ever allowed himself to\nconceive. If he had been called upon to pass through the village on\nfirst assuming the new clothes, every stitch would have pricked him as\nif the needle remained in it; but a quiet walk down the brookside, by\nthe pleasant path through the thickets and over the fragrant meadows,\nwith a consciousness of his own neatness and freshness at every step,\nand with kind Ann Pardon's commendation at the close, and the flattering\ncuriosity of the children,--the only ones who never made fun of\nhim,--all that was a delightful prospect. He could never, NEVER forget\nhimself, as he had seen other young fellows do; but to remember himself\nagreeably was certainly the next best thing.\n\nJacob was already a well-grown man of twenty-three, and would have made\na good enough appearance but for the stoop in his shoulders, and the\ndrooping, uneasy way in which he carried his head. Many a time when he\nwas alone in the fields or woods he had straightened himself, and looked\ncourageously at the buts of the oak-trees or in the very eyes of the\nindifferent oxen; but, when a human face drew near, some spring in his\nneck seemed to snap, some buckle around his shoulders to be drawn three\nholes tighter, and he found himself in the old posture. The ever-present\nthought of this weakness was the only drop of bitterness in his cup, as\nhe followed the lonely path through the thickets.\n\nSome spirit in the sweet, delicious freshness of the air, some voice in\nthe mellow babble of the stream, leaping in and out of sight between the\nalders, some smile of light, lingering on the rising corn-fields beyond\nthe meadow and the melting purple of a distant hill, reached to the\nseclusion of his heart. He was soothed and cheered; his head lifted\nitself in the presentiment of a future less lonely than the past, and\nthe everlasting trouble vanished from his eyes.\n\nSuddenly, at a turn of the path, two mowers from the meadow, with their\nscythes upon their shoulders, came upon him. He had not heard their feet\non the deep turf. His chest relaxed, and his head began to sink; then,\nwith the most desperate effort in his life, he lifted it again, and,\ndarting a rapid side glance at the men, hastened by. They could not\nunderstand the mixed defiance and supplication of his face; to them he\nonly looked “queer.”\n\n“Been committin' a murder, have you?” asked one of them, grinning.\n\n“Startin' off on his journey, I guess,” said the other.\n\nThe next instant they were gone, and Jacob, with set teeth and clinched\nhands, smothered something that would have been a howl if he had given\nit voice. Sharp lines of pain were marked on his face, and, for the\nfirst time, the idea of resistance took fierce and bitter possession of\nhis heart. But the mood was too unusual to last; presently he shook his\nhead, and walked on towards Pardon's farm-house.\n\nAnn wore a smart gingham dress, and her first exclamation was: “Why,\nJake! how nice you look. And so you know all about it, too?”\n\n“About what?”\n\n“I see you don't,” said she. “I was too fast; but it makes no\ndifference. I know you are willing to lend me a helping hand.”\n\n“Oh, to be sure,” Jacob answered.\n\n“And not mind a little company?”\n\nJacob's face suddenly clouded; but he said, though with an effort:\n“No--not much--if I can be of any help.”\n\n“It's rather a joke, after all,” Ann Pardon continued, speaking rapidly;\n“they meant a surprise, a few of the young people; but sister Becky\nfound a way to send me word, or I might have been caught like Meribah\nJohnson last week, in the middle of my work; eight or ten, she said,\nbut more may drop in: and it's moonlight and warm, so they'll be mostly\nunder the trees; and Robert won't be home till late, and I DO want help\nin carrying chairs, and getting up some ice, and handing around; and,\nthough I know you don't care for merry makings, you CAN help me out, you\nsee--”\n\nHere she paused. Jacob looked perplexed, but said nothing.\n\n“Becky will help what she can, and while I'm in the kitchen she'll have\nan eye to things outside,” she said.\n\nJacob's head was down again, and, moreover, turned on one side, but his\near betrayed the mounting blood. Finally he answered, in a quick, husky\nvoice: “Well, I'll do what I can. What's first?”\n\nThereupon he began to carry some benches from the veranda to a grassy\nbank beside the sycamore-tree. Ann Pardon wisely said no more of the\ncoming surprise-party, but kept him so employed that, as the visitors\narrived by twos and threes, the merriment was in full play almost before\nhe was aware of it. Moreover, the night was a protecting presence: the\nmoonlight poured splendidly upon the open turf beyond the sycamore, but\nevery lilac-bush or trellis of woodbine made a nook of shade, wherein he\ncould pause a moment and take courage for his duties. Becky Morton, Ann\nPardon's youngest sister, frightened him a little every time she came\nto consult about the arrangement of seats or the distribution of\nrefreshments; but it was a delightful, fascinating fear, such as he had\nnever felt before in his life. He knew Becky, but he had never seen her\nin white and pink, with floating tresses, until now. In fact, he had\nhardly looked at her fairly, but now, as she glided into the moonlight\nand he paused in the shadow, his eyes took note of her exceeding beauty.\nSome sweet, confusing influence, he knew not what, passed into his\nblood.\n\nThe young men had brought a fiddler from the village, and it was not\nlong before most of the company were treading the measures of reels or\ncotillons on the grass. How merry and happy they all were! How freely\nand unembarrassedly they moved and talked! By and by all became involved\nin the dance, and Jacob, left alone and unnoticed, drew nearer and\nnearer to the gay and beautiful life from which he was expelled.\n\nWith a long-drawn scream of the fiddle the dance came to an end, and the\ndancers, laughing, chattering, panting, and fanning themselves, broke\ninto groups and scattered over the enclosure before the house. Jacob was\nsurrounded before he could escape. Becky, with two lively girls in her\nwake, came up to him and said: “Oh Mr. Flint, why don't you dance?”\n\nIf he had stopped to consider, he would no doubt have replied very\ndifferently. But a hundred questions, stirred by what he had seen, were\nclamoring for light, and they threw the desperate impulse to his lips.\n\n“If I COULD dance, would you dance with me?”\n\nThe two lively girls heard the words, and looked at Becky with roguish\nfaces.\n\n“Oh yes, take him for your next partner!” cried one.\n\n“I will,” said Becky, “after he comes back from his journey.”\n\nThen all three laughed. Jacob leaned against the tree, his eyes fixed on\nthe ground.\n\n“Is it a bargain?” asked one of the girls.\n\n“No,” said he, and walked rapidly away.\n\nHe went to the house, and, finding that Robert had arrived, took his\nhat, and left by the rear door. There was a grassy alley between the\norchard and garden, from which it was divided by a high hawthorn hedge.\nHe had scarcely taken three paces on his way to the meadow, when the\nsound of the voice he had last heard, on the other side of the hedge,\narrested his feet.\n\n“Becky, I think you rather hurt Jake Flint,” said the girl.\n\n“Hardly,” answered Becky; “he's used to that.”\n\n“Not if he likes you; and you might go further and fare worse.”\n\n“Well, I MUST say!” Becky exclaimed, with a laugh; “you'd like to see me\nstuck in that hollow, out of your way!”\n\n“It's a good farm, I've heard,” said the other.\n\n“Yes, and covered with as much as it'll bear!”\n\nHere the girls were called away to the dance. Jacob slowly walked up\nthe dewy meadow, the sounds of fiddling, singing, and laughter growing\nfainter behind him.\n\n“My journey!” he repeated to himself,--“my journey! why shouldn't I\nstart on it now? Start off, and never come back?”\n\nIt was a very little thing, after all, which annoyed him, but the\nmention of it always touched a sore nerve of his nature. A dozen years\nbefore, when a boy at school, he had made a temporary friendship with\nanother boy of his age, and had one day said to the latter, in the\nwarmth of his first generous confidence: “When I am a little older,\nI shall make a great journey, and come back rich, and buy Whitney's\nplace!”\n\nNow, Whitney's place, with its stately old brick mansion, its avenue of\nsilver firs, and its two hundred acres of clean, warm-lying land, was\nthe finest, the most aristocratic property in all the neighborhood,\nand the boy-friend could not resist the temptation of repeating Jacob's\ngrand design, for the endless amusement of the school. The betrayal hurt\nJacob more keenly than the ridicule. It left a wound that never ceased\nto rankle; yet, with the inconceivable perversity of unthinking\nnatures, precisely this joke (as the people supposed it to be) had been\nperpetuated, until “Jake Flint's Journey” was a synonyme for any absurd\nor extravagant expectation. Perhaps no one imagined how much pain he was\nkeeping alive; for almost any other man than Jacob would have joined\nin the laugh against himself and thus good-naturedly buried the joke in\ntime. “He's used to that,” the people said, like Becky Morton, and they\nreally supposed there was nothing unkind in the remark!\n\nAfter Jacob had passed the thickets and entered the lonely hollow in\nwhich his father's house lay, his pace became slower and slower.\n\nHe looked at the shabby old building, just touched by the moonlight\nbehind the swaying shadows of the weeping-willow, stopped, looked again,\nand finally seated himself on a stump beside the path.\n\n“If I knew what to do!” he said to himself, rocking backwards and\nforwards, with his hands clasped over his knees,--“if I knew what to\ndo!”\n\nThe spiritual tension of the evening reached its climax: he could bear\nno more. With a strong bodily shudder his tears burst forth, and the\npassion of his weeping filled him from head to foot. How long he wept\nhe knew not; it seemed as if the hot fountains would never run dry.\nSuddenly and startlingly a hand fell upon his shoulder.\n\n“Boy, what does this mean?”\n\nIt was his father who stood before him.\n\nJacob looked up like some shy animal brought to bay, his eyes full of a\nfeeling mixed of fierceness and terror; but he said nothing.\n\nHis father seated himself on one of the roots of the old stump, laid one\nhand upon Jacob's knee, and said with an unusual gentleness of manner,\n“I'd like to know what it is that troubles you so much.”\n\nAfter a pause, Jacob suddenly burst forth with: “Is there any reason why\nI should tell you? Do you care any more for me than the rest of 'em?”\n\n“I didn't know as you wanted me to care for you particularly,” said the\nfather, almost deprecatingly. “I always thought you had friends of your\nown age.”\n\n“Friends? Devils!” exclaimed Jacob. “Oh, what have I done--what is there\nso dreadful about me that I should always be laughed at, and despised,\nand trampled upon? You are a great deal older than I am, father: what do\nyou see in me? Tell me what it is, and how to get over it!”\n\nThe eyes of the two men met. Jacob saw his father's face grow pale in\nthe moonlight, while he pressed his hand involuntarily upon his heart,\nas if struggling with some physical pain. At last he spoke, but his\nwords were strange and incoherent.\n\n“I couldn't sleep,” he said; “I got up again and came out o' doors.\nThe white ox had broken down the fence at the corner, and would soon\nhave been in the cornfield. I thought it was that, maybe, but still\nyour--your mother would come into my head. I was coming down the edge of\nthe wood when I saw you, and I don't know why it was that you seemed so\ndifferent, all at once--”\n\nHere he paused, and was silent for a minute. Then he said, in a grave,\ncommanding tone: “Just let me know the whole story. I have that much\nright yet.”\n\nJacob related the history of the evening, somewhat awkwardly and\nconfusedly, it is true; but his father's brief, pointed questions kept\nhim to the narrative, and forced him to explain the full significance\nof the expressions he repeated. At the mention of “Whitney's place,” a\nsingular expression of malice touched the old man's face.\n\n“Do you love Becky Morton?” he asked bluntly, when all had been told.\n\n“I don't know,” Jacob stammered; “I think not; because when I seem to\nlike her most, I feel afraid of her.”\n\n“It's lucky that you're not sure of it!” exclaimed the old man with\nenergy; “because you should never have her.”\n\n“No,” said Jacob, with a mournful acquiescence, “I can never have her,\nor any other one.”\n\n“But you shall--and will I when I help you. It's true I've not seemed to\ncare much about you, and I suppose you're free to think as you like; but\nthis I say: I'll not stand by and see you spit upon! 'Covered with as\nmuch as it'll bear!' THAT'S a piece o' luck anyhow. If we're poor, your\nwife must take your poverty with you, or she don't come into MY doors.\nBut first of all you must make your journey!”\n\n“My journey!” repeated Jacob.\n\n“Weren't you thinking of it this night, before you took your seat on\nthat stump? A little more, and you'd have gone clean off, I reckon.”\n\nJacob was silent, and hung his head.\n\n“Never mind! I've no right to think hard of it. In a week we'll have\nfinished our haying, and then it's a fortnight to wheat; but, for that\nmatter, Harry and I can manage the wheat by ourselves. You may take a\nmonth, two months, if any thing comes of it. Under a month I don't mean\nthat you shall come back. I'll give you twenty dollars for a start; if\nyou want more you must earn it on the road, any way you please. And,\nmark you, Jacob! since you ARE poor, don't let anybody suppose you are\nrich. For my part, I shall not expect you to buy Whitney's place; all I\nask is that you'll tell me, fair and square, just what things and what\npeople you've got acquainted with. Get to bed now--the matter's settled;\nI will have it so.”\n\nThey rose and walked across the meadow to the house. Jacob had quite\nforgotten the events of the evening in the new prospect suddenly opened\nto him, which filled him with a wonderful confusion of fear and desire.\nHis father said nothing more. They entered the lonely house together at\nmidnight, and went to their beds; but Jacob slept very little.\n\nSix days afterwards he left home, on a sparkling June morning, with\na small bundle tied in a yellow silk handkerchief under his arm. His\nfather had furnished him with the promised money, but had positively\nrefused to tell him what road he should take, or what plan of action he\nshould adopt. The only stipulation was that his absence from home should\nnot be less than a month.\n\nAfter he had passed the wood and reached the highway which followed\nthe course of the brook, he paused to consider which course to take.\nSouthward the road led past Pardon's, and he longed to see his only\nfriends once more before encountering untried hazards; but the village\nwas beyond, and he had no courage to walk through its one long street\nwith a bundle, denoting a journey, under his arm. Northward he would\nhave to pass the mill and blacksmith's shop at the cross-roads. Then he\nremembered that he might easily wade the stream at a point where it was\nshallow, and keep in the shelter of the woods on the opposite hill until\nhe struck the road farther on, and in that direction two or three miles\nwould take him into a neighborhood where he was not known.\n\nOnce in the woods, an exquisite sense of freedom came upon him. There\nwas nothing mocking in the soft, graceful stir of the expanded foliage,\nin the twittering of the unfrightened birds, or the scampering of the\nsquirrels, over the rustling carpet of dead leaves. He lay down upon the\nmoss under a spreading beech-tree and tried to think; but the thoughts\nwould not come. He could not even clearly recall the keen troubles and\nmortifications he had endured: all things were so peaceful and beautiful\nthat a portion of their peace and beauty fell upon men and invested them\nwith a more kindly character.\n\nTowards noon Jacob found himself beyond the limited geography of his\nlife. The first man he encountered was a stranger, who greeted him with\na hearty and respectful “How do you do, sir?”\n\n“Perhaps,” thought Jacob, “I am not so very different from other people,\nif I only thought so myself.”\n\nAt noon, he stopped at a farm-house by the roadside to get a drink of\nwater. A pleasant woman, who came from the door at that moment with a\npitcher, allowed him to lower the bucket and haul it up dripping with\nprecious coolness. She looked upon him with good-will, for he had\nallowed her to see his eyes, and something in their honest, appealing\nexpression went to her heart.\n\n“We're going to have dinner in five minutes,” said she; “won't you stay\nand have something?”\n\nJacob stayed and brake bread with the plain, hospitable family. Their\nkindly attention to him during the meal gave him the lacking nerve;\nfor a moment he resolved to offer his services to the farmer, but he\npresently saw that they were not really needed, and, besides, the place\nwas still too near home.\n\nTowards night he reached an old country tavern, lording it over\nan incipient village of six houses. The landlord and hostler were\ninspecting a drooping-looking horse in front of the stables. Now, if\nthere was any thing which Jacob understood, to the extent of his limited\nexperience, it was horse nature. He drew near, listened to the views of\nthe two men, examined the animal with his eyes, and was ready to answer,\n“Yes, I guess so,” when the landlord said, “Perhaps, sir, you can tell\nwhat is the matter with him.”\n\nHis prompt detection of the ailment, and prescription of a remedy which\nin an hour showed its good effects, installed him in the landlord's best\ngraces. The latter said, “Well, it shall cost you nothing to-night,”\n as he led the way to the supper-room. When Jacob went to bed he was\nsurprised on reflecting that he had not only been talking for a full\nhour in the bar-room, but had been looking people in the face.\n\nResisting an offer of good wages if he would stay and help look after\nthe stables, he set forward the next morning with a new and most\ndelightful confidence in himself. The knowledge that now nobody knew him\nas “Jake Flint” quite removed his tortured self-consciousness. When\nhe met a person who was glum and ungracious of speech, he saw,\nnevertheless, that he was not its special object. He was sometimes asked\nquestions, to be sure, which a little embarrassed him, but he soon hit\nupon answers which were sufficiently true without betraying his purpose.\n\nWandering sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left, he slowly\nmade his way into the land, until, on the afternoon of the fourth day\nafter leaving home, he found himself in a rougher region--a rocky, hilly\ntract, with small and not very flourishing farms in the valleys. Here\nthe season appeared to be more backward than in the open country; the\nhay harvest was not yet over.\n\nJacob's taste for scenery was not particularly cultivated, but something\nin the loneliness and quiet of the farms reminded him of his own home;\nand he looked at one house after another, deliberating with himself\nwhether it would not be a good place to spend the remainder of his month\nof probation. He seemed to be very far from home--about forty miles, in\nfact,--and was beginning to feel a little tired of wandering.\n\nFinally the road climbed a low pass of the hills, and dropped into\na valley on the opposite side. There was but one house in view--a\ntwo-story building of logs and plaster, with a garden and orchard on the\nhillside in the rear. A large meadow stretched in front, and when the\nwhole of it lay clear before him, as the road issued from a wood, his\neye was caught by an unusual harvest picture.\n\nDirectly before him, a woman, whose face was concealed by a huge,\nflapping sun-bonnet, was seated upon a mowing machine, guiding a span\nof horses around the great tract of thick grass which was still uncut.\nA little distance off, a boy and girl were raking the drier swaths\ntogether, and a hay-cart, drawn by oxen and driven by a man, was just\nentering the meadow from the side next the barn.\n\nJacob hung his bundle upon a stake, threw his coat and waistcoat over\nthe rail, and, resting his chin on his shirted arms, leaned on the\nfence, and watched the hay-makers. As the woman came down the nearer\nside she appeared to notice him, for her head was turned from time to\ntime in his direction. When she had made the round, she stopped the\nhorses at the corner, sprang lightly from her seat and called to the\nman, who, leaving his team, met her half-way. They were nearly a furlong\ndistant, but Jacob was quite sure that she pointed to him, and that\nthe man looked in the same direction. Presently she set off across the\nmeadow, directly towards him.\n\nWhen within a few paces of the fence, she stopped, threw back the flaps\nof her sun-bonnet, and said, “Good day to you!” Jacob was so amazed to\nsee a bright, fresh, girlish face, that he stared at her with all his\neyes, forgetting to drop his head. Indeed, he could not have done so,\nfor his chin was propped upon the top rail of the fence.\n\n“You are a stranger, I see,” she added.\n\n“Yes, in these parts,” he replied.\n\n“Looking for work?”\n\nHe hardly knew what answer to make, so he said, at a venture, “That's as\nit happens.” Then he colored a little, for the words seemed foolish to\nhis ears.\n\n“Time's precious,” said the girl, “so I'll tell you at once we want\nhelp. Our hay MUST be got in while the fine weather lasts.”\n\n“I'll help you!” Jacob exclaimed, taking his arms from the rail, and\nlooking as willing as he felt.\n\n“I'm so glad! But I must tell you, at first, that we're not rich, and\nthe hands are asking a great deal now. How much do you expect?”\n\n“Whatever you please?” said he, climbing the fence.\n\n“No, that's not our way of doing business. What do you say to a dollar a\nday, and found?”\n\n“All right!” and with the words he was already at her side, taking long\nstrides over the elastic turf.\n\n“I will go on with my mowing,” said she, when they reached the horses,\n“and you can rake and load with my father. What name shall I call you\nby?”\n\n“Everybody calls me Jake.”\n\n“'Jake!' Jacob is better. Well, Jacob, I hope you'll give us all the\nhelp you can.”\n\nWith a nod and a light laugh she sprang upon the machine. There was\na sweet throb in Jacob's heart, which, if he could have expressed it,\nwould have been a triumphant shout of “I'm not afraid of her! I'm not\nafraid of her!”\n\nThe farmer was a kindly, depressed man, with whose quiet ways Jacob\ninstantly felt himself at home. They worked steadily until sunset, when\nthe girl, detaching her horses from the machine, mounted one of them and\nled the other to the barn. At the supper-table, the farmer's wife said:\n“Susan, you must be very tired.”\n\n“Not now, mother!” she cheerily answered. “I was, I think, but after I\npicked up Jacob I felt sure we should get our hay in.”\n\n“It was a good thing,” said the farmer; “Jacob don't need to be told how\nto work.”\n\nPoor Jacob! He was so happy he could have cried. He sat and listened,\nand blushed a little, with a smile on his face which it was a pleasure\nto see. The honest people did not seem to regard him in the least as a\nstranger; they discussed their family interests and troubles and hopes\nbefore him, and in a little while it seemed as if he had known them\nalways.\n\nHow faithfully he worked! How glad and tired he felt when night came,\nand the hay-mow was filled, and the great stacks grew beside the barn!\nBut ah! the haying came to an end, and on the last evening, at supper,\neverybody was constrained and silent. Even Susan looked grave and\nthoughtful.\n\n“Jacob,” said the farmer, finally, “I wish we could keep you until wheat\nharvest; but you know we are poor, and can't afford it. Perhaps you\ncould--”\n\nHe hesitated; but Jacob, catching at the chance and obeying his own\nunselfish impulse, cried: “Oh, yes, I can; I'll be satisfied with my\nboard, till the wheat's ripe.”\n\nSusan looked at him quickly, with a bright, speaking face. “It's hardly\nfair to you,” said the farmer.\n\n“But I like to be here so much!” Jacob cried. “I like--all of you!”\n\n“We DO seem to suit,” said the farmer, “like as one family. And that\nreminds me, we've not heard your family name yet.”\n\n“Flint.”\n\n“Jacob FLINT!” exclaimed the farmer's wife, with sudden agitation.\n\nJacob was scared and troubled. They had heard of him, he thought, and\nwho knew what ridiculous stories? Susan noticed an anxiety on his face\nwhich she could not understand, but she unknowingly came to his relief.\n\n“Why, mother,” she asked, “do you know Jacob's family?”\n\n“No, I think not,” said her mother, “only somebody of the name, long\nago.”\n\nHis offer, however, was gratefully accepted. The bright, hot summer days\ncame and went, but no flower of July ever opened as rapidly and richly\nand warmly as his chilled, retarded nature. New thoughts and instincts\ncame with every morning's sun, and new conclusions were reached with\nevery evening's twilight. Yet as the wheat harvest drew towards the end,\nhe felt that he must leave the place. The month of absence had gone by,\nhe scarce knew how. He was free to return home, and, though he might\noffer to bridge over the gap between wheat and oats, as he had already\ndone between hay and wheat, he imagined the family might hesitate to\naccept such an offer. Moreover, this life at Susan's side was fast\ngrowing to be a pain, unless he could assure himself that it would be so\nforever.\n\nThey were in the wheat-field, busy with the last sheaves; she raking and\nhe binding. The farmer and younger children had gone to the barn with a\nload. Jacob was working silently and steadily, but when they had reached\nthe end of a row, he stopped, wiped his wet brow, and suddenly said,\n“Susan, I suppose to-day finishes my work here.”\n\n“Yes,” she answered very slowly.\n\n“And yet I'm very sorry to go.”\n\n“I--WE don't want you to go, if we could help it.”\n\nJacob appeared to struggle with himself. He attempted to speak. “If I\ncould--” he brought out, and then paused. “Susan, would you be glad if I\ncame back?”\n\nHis eyes implored her to read his meaning. No doubt she read it\ncorrectly, for her face flushed, her eyelids fell, and she barely\nmurmured, “Yes, Jacob.”\n\n“Then I'll come!” he cried; “I'll come and help you with the oats. Don't\ntalk of pay! Only tell me I'll be welcome! Susan, don't you believe I'll\nkeep my word?”\n\n“I do indeed,” said she, looking him firmly in the face.\n\nThat was all that was said at the time; but the two understood each\nother tolerably well.\n\nOn the afternoon of the second day, Jacob saw again the lonely house of\nhis father. His journey was made, yet, if any of the neighbors had seen\nhim, they would never have believed that he had come back rich.\n\nSamuel Flint turned away to hide a peculiar smile when he saw his son;\nbut little was said until late that evening, after Harry and Sally\nhad left. Then he required and received an exact account of Jacob's\nexperience during his absence. After hearing the story to the end, he\nsaid, “And so you love this Susan Meadows?”\n\n“I'd--I'd do any thing to be with her.”\n\n“Are you afraid of her?”\n\n“No!” Jacob uttered the word so emphatically that it rang through the\nhouse.\n\n“Ah, well!” said the old man, lifting his eyes, and speaking in the air,\n“all the harm may be mended yet. But there must be another test.” Then\nhe was silent for some time.\n\n“I have it!” he finally exclaimed. “Jacob, you must go back for the oats\nharvest. You must ask Susan to be your wife, and ask her parents to let\nyou have her. But,--pay attention to my words!--you must tell her that\nyou are a poor, hired man on this place, and that she can be engaged as\nhousekeeper. Don't speak of me as your father, but as the owner of\nthe farm. Bring her here in that belief, and let me see how honest and\nwilling she is. I can easily arrange matters with Harry and Sally while\nyou are away; and I'll only ask you to keep up the appearance of the\nthing for a month or so.”\n\n“But, father,”--Jacob began.\n\n“Not a word! Are you not willing to do that much for the sake of having\nher all your life, and this farm after me? Suppose it is covered with\na mortgage, if she is all you say, you two can work it off. Not a word\nmore! It is no lie, after all, that you will tell her.”\n\n“I am afraid,” said Jacob, “that she could not leave her home now. She\nis too useful there, and the family is so poor.”\n\n“Tell them that both your wages, for the first year, shall go to them.\nIt'll be my business to rake and scrape the money together somehow. Say,\ntoo, that the housekeeper's place can't be kept for her--must be filled\nat once. Push matters like a man, if you mean to be a complete one, and\nbring her here, if she carries no more with her than the clothes on her\nback!”\n\nDuring the following days Jacob had time to familiarize his mind with\nthis startling proposal. He knew his father's stubborn will too well\nto suppose that it could be changed; but the inevitable soon converted\nitself into the possible and desirable. The sweet face of Susan as she\nhad stood before him in the wheat-field was continually present to his\neyes, and ere long, he began to place her, in his thoughts, in the old\nrooms at home, in the garden, among the thickets by the brook, and in\nAnn Pardon's pleasant parlor. Enough; his father's plan became his own\nlong before the time was out.\n\nOn his second journey everybody seemed to be an old acquaintance and an\nintimate friend. It was evening as he approached the Meadows farm, but\nthe younger children recognized him in the dusk, and their cry of, “Oh,\nhere's Jacob!” brought out the farmer and his wife and Susan, with the\nheartiest of welcomes. They had all missed him, they said--even the\nhorses and oxen had looked for him, and they were wondering how they\nshould get the oats harvested without him.\n\nJacob looked at Susan as the farmer said this, and her eyes seemed to\nanswer, “I said nothing, but I knew you would come.” Then, first, he\nfelt sufficient courage for the task before him.\n\nHe rose the next morning, before any one was stirring, and waited until\nshe should come down stairs. The sun had not risen when she appeared,\nwith a milk-pail in each hand, walking unsuspectingly to the cow-yard.\nHe waylaid her, took the pails in his hand and said in nervous haste,\n“Susan, will you be my wife?”\n\nShe stopped as if she had received a sudden blow; then a shy, sweet\nconsent seemed to run through her heart. “O Jacob!” was all she could\nsay.\n\n“But you will, Susan?” he urged; and then (neither of them exactly knew\nhow it happened) all at once his arms were around her, and they had\nkissed each other.\n\n“Susan,” he said, presently, “I am a poor man--only a farm hand, and\nmust work for my living. You could look for a better husband.”\n\n“I could never find a better than you, Jacob.”\n\n“Would you work with me, too, at the same place?”\n\n“You know I am not afraid of work,” she answered, “and I could never\nwant any other lot than yours.”\n\nThen he told her the story which his father had prompted. Her face grew\nbright and happy as she listened, and he saw how from her very heart\nshe accepted the humble fortune. Only the thought of her parents threw\na cloud over the new and astonishing vision. Jacob, however, grew bolder\nas he saw fulfilment of his hope so near. They took the pails and seated\nthemselves beside neighbor cows, one raising objections or misgivings\nwhich the other manfully combated. Jacob's earnestness unconsciously ran\ninto his hands, as he discovered when the impatient cow began to snort\nand kick.\n\nThe harvesting of the oats was not commenced that morning. The children\nwere sent away, and there was a council of four persons held in the\nparlor. The result of mutual protestations and much weeping was, that\nthe farmer and his wife agreed to receive Jacob as a son-in-law; the\noffer of the wages was four times refused by them, and then accepted;\nand the chance of their being able to live and labor together was\nfinally decided to be too fortunate to let slip. When the shock and\nsurprise was over all gradually became cheerful, and, as the matter\nwas more calmly discussed, the first conjectured difficulties somehow\nresolved themselves into trifles.\n\nIt was the simplest and quietest wedding,--at home, on an August\nmorning. Farmer Meadows then drove the bridal pair half-way on their\njourney, to the old country tavern, where a fresh conveyance had been\nengaged for them. The same evening they reached the farm-house in the\nvalley, and Jacob's happy mood gave place to an anxious uncertainty as\nhe remembered the period of deception upon which Susan was entering.\nHe keenly watched his father's face when they arrived, and was a little\nrelieved when he saw that his wife had made a good first impression.\n\n“So, this is my new housekeeper,” said the old man. “I hope you will\nsuit me as well as your husband does.”\n\n“I'll do my best, sir,” said she; “but you must have patience with me\nfor a few days, until I know your ways and wishes.”\n\n“Mr. Flint,” said Sally, “shall I get supper ready?” Susan looked up in\nastonishment at hearing the name.\n\n“Yes,” the old man remarked, “we both have the same name. The fact is,\nJacob and I are a sort of relations.”\n\nJacob, in spite of his new happiness, continued ill at ease, although\nhe could not help seeing how his father brightened under Susan's genial\ninfluence, how satisfied he was with her quick, neat, exact ways and the\ncheerfulness with which she fulfilled her duties. At the end of a week,\nthe old man counted out the wages agreed upon for both, and his delight\nculminated at the frank simplicity with which Susan took what she\nsupposed she had fairly earned.\n\n“Jacob,” he whispered when she had left the room, “keep quiet one more\nweek, and then I'll let her know.”\n\nHe had scarcely spoken, when Susan burst into the room again, crying,\n“Jacob, they are coming, they have come!”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Father and mother; and we didn't expect them, you know, for a week\nyet.”\n\nAll three went to the door as the visitors made their appearance on\nthe veranda. Two of the party stood as if thunderstruck, and two\nexclamations came together:\n\n“Samuel Flint!”\n\n“Lucy Wheeler!”\n\nThere was a moment's silence; then the farmer's wife, with a visible\neffort to compose herself, said, “Lucy Meadows, now.”\n\nThe tears came into Samuel Flint's eyes. “Let us shake hands, Lucy,” he\nsaid: “my son has married your daughter.”\n\nAll but Jacob were freshly startled at these words. The two shook hands,\nand then Samuel, turning to Susan's father, said: “And this is your\nhusband, Lucy. I am glad to make his acquaintance.”\n\n“Your father, Jacob!” Susan cried; “what does it all mean?”\n\nJacob's face grew red, and the old habit of hanging his head nearly\ncame back upon him. He knew not what to say, and looked wistfully at his\nfather.\n\n“Come into the house and sit down,” said the latter. “I think we shall\nall feel better when we have quietly and comfortably talked the matter\nover.”\n\nThey went into the quaint, old-fashioned parlor, which had already been\ntransformed by Susan's care, so that much of its shabbiness was hidden.\nWhen all were seated, and Samuel Flint perceived that none of the others\nknew what to say, he took a resolution which, for a man of his mood and\nhabit of life, required some courage.\n\n“Three of us here are old people,” he began, “and the two young ones\nlove each other. It was so long ago, Lucy, that it cannot be laid to my\nblame if I speak of it now. Your husband, I see, has an honest heart,\nand will not misunderstand either of us. The same thing often turns\nup in life; it is one of those secrets that everybody knows, and that\neverybody talks about except the persons concerned. When I was a young\nman, Lucy, I loved you truly, and I faithfully meant to make you my\nwife.”\n\n“I thought so too, for a while,” said she, very calmly.\n\nFarmer Meadows looked at his wife, and no face was ever more beautiful\nthan his, with that expression of generous pity shining through it.\n\n“You know how I acted,” Samuel Flint continued, “but our children must\nalso know that I broke off from you without giving any reason.\nA woman came between us and made all the mischief. I was considered\nrich then, and she wanted to secure my money for her daughter. I was an\ninnocent and unsuspecting young man, who believed that everybody else\nwas as good as myself; and the woman never rested until she had turned\nme from my first love, and fastened me for life to another. Little by\nlittle I discovered the truth; I kept the knowledge of the injury to\nmyself; I quickly got rid of the money which had so cursed me, and\nbrought my wife to this, the loneliest and dreariest place in the\nneighborhood, where I forced upon her a life of poverty. I thought it\nwas a just revenge, but I was unjust. She really loved me: she was, if\nnot quite without blame in the matter, ignorant of the worst that had\nbeen done (I learned all that too late), and she never complained,\nthough the change in me slowly wore out her life. I know now that I\nwas cruel; but at the same time I punished myself, and was innocently\npunishing my son. But to HIM there was one way to make amends. 'I will\nhelp him to a wife,' I said, 'who will gladly take poverty with him\nand for his sake.' I forced him, against his will, to say that he was a\nhired hand on this place, and that Susan must be content to be a hired\nhousekeeper. Now that I know Susan, I see that this proof might have\nbeen left out; but I guess it has done no harm. The place is not so\nheavily mortgaged as people think, and it will be Jacob's after I am\ngone. And now forgive me, all of you,--Lucy first, for she has most\ncause; Jacob next; and Susan,--that will be easier; and you, Friend\nMeadows, if what I have said has been hard for you to hear.”\n\nThe farmer stood up like a man, took Samuel's hand and his wife's, and\nsaid, in a broken voice: “Lucy, I ask you, too, to forgive him, and I\nask you both to be good friends to each other.”\n\nSusan, dissolved in tears, kissed all of them in turn; but the happiest\nheart there was Jacob's.\n\nIt was now easy for him to confide to his wife the complete story of\nhis troubles, and to find his growing self-reliance strengthened by her\nquick, intelligent sympathy. The Pardons were better friends than\never, and the fact, which at first created great astonishment in the\nneighborhood, that Jacob Flint had really gone upon a journey and\nbrought home a handsome wife, began to change the attitude of the\npeople towards him. The old place was no longer so lonely; the nearest\nneighbors began to drop in and insist on return visits. Now that Jacob\nkept his head up, and they got a fair view of his face, they discovered\nthat he was not lacking, after all, in sense or social qualities.\n\nIn October, the Whitney place, which had been leased for several years,\nwas advertised to be sold at public sale. The owner had gone to the city\nand become a successful merchant, had outlived his local attachments,\nand now took advantage of a rise in real estate to disburden himself of\na property which he could not profitably control.\n\nEverybody from far and wide attended the sale, and, when Jacob Flint and\nhis father arrived, everybody said to the former: “Of course you've\ncome to buy, Jacob.” But each man laughed at his own smartness, and\nconsidered the remark original with himself.\n\nJacob was no longer annoyed. He laughed, too, and answered: “I'm afraid\nI can't do that; but I've kept half my word, which is more than most men\ndo.”\n\n“Jake's no fool, after all,” was whispered behind him.\n\nThe bidding commenced, at first very spirited, and then gradually\nslacking off, as the price mounted above the means of the neighboring\nfarmers. The chief aspirant was a stranger, a well-dressed man with\na lawyer's air, whom nobody knew. After the usual long pauses and\npassionate exhortations, the hammer fell, and the auctioneer, turning to\nthe stranger, asked, “What name?”\n\n“Jacob Flint!”\n\nThere was a general cry of surprise. All looked at Jacob, whose eyes and\nmouth showed that he was as dumbfoundered as the rest.\n\nThe stranger walked coolly through the midst of the crowd to Samuel\nFlint, and said, “When shall I have the papers drawn up?”\n\n“As soon as you can,” the old man replied; then seizing Jacob by the\narm, with the words, “Let's go home now!” he hurried him on.\n\nThe explanation soon leaked out. Samuel Flint had not thrown away his\nwealth, but had put it out of his own hands. It was given privately to\ntrustees, to be held for his son, and returned when the latter should\nhave married with his father's consent. There was more than enough to\nbuy the Whitney place.\n\nJacob and Susan are happy in their stately home, and good as they are\nhappy. If any person in the neighborhood ever makes use of the phrase\n“Jacob Flint's Journey,” he intends thereby to symbolize the good\nfortune which sometimes follows honesty, reticence, and shrewdness.\n\n\n\n\nCAN A LIFE HIDE ITSELF?\n\n\nI had been reading, as is my wont from time to time, one of the many\nvolumes of “The New Pitaval,” that singular record of human crime and\nhuman cunning, and also of the inevitable fatality which, in every\ncase, leaves a gate open for detection. Were it not for the latter fact,\nindeed, one would turn with loathing from such endless chronicles\nof wickedness. Yet these may be safely contemplated, when one has\ndiscovered the incredible fatuity of crime, the certain weak mesh in\na network of devilish texture; or is it rather the agency of a power\noutside of man, a subtile protecting principle, which allows the\noperation of the evil element only that the latter may finally betray\nitself? Whatever explanation we may choose, the fact is there, like a\ntonic medicine distilled from poisonous plants, to brace our faith in\nthe ascendancy of Good in the government of the world.\n\nLaying aside the book, I fell into a speculation concerning the mixture\nof the two elements in man's nature. The life of an individual is\nusually, it seemed to me, a series of RESULTS, the processes leading to\nwhich are not often visible, or observed when they are so. Each act\nis the precipitation of a number of mixed influences, more or less\nunconsciously felt; the qualities of good and evil are so blended\ntherein that they defy the keenest moral analysis; and how shall we,\nthen, pretend to judge of any one? Perhaps the surest indication of evil\n(I further reflected) is that it always tries to conceal itself, and\nthe strongest incitement to good is that evil cannot be concealed. The\ncrime, or the vice, or even the self-acknowledged weakness, becomes\na part of the individual consciousness; it cannot be forgotten or\noutgrown. It follows a life through all experiences and to the uttermost\nends of the earth, pressing towards the light with a terrible, demoniac\npower. There are noteless lives, of course--lives that accept obscurity,\nmechanically run their narrow round of circumstance, and are lost; but\nwhen a life endeavors to lose itself,--to hide some conscious guilt or\nfailure,--can it succeed? Is it not thereby lifted above the level of\ncommon experience, compelling attention to itself by the very endeavor\nto escape it?\n\nI turned these questions over in my mind, without approaching, or indeed\nexpecting, any solution,--since I knew, from habit, the labyrinths into\nwhich they would certainly lead me,--when a visitor was announced. It\nwas one of the directors of our county almshouse, who came on an errand\nto which he attached no great importance. I owed the visit, apparently,\nto the circumstance that my home lay in his way, and he could at once\nrelieve his conscience of a very trifling pressure and his pocket of a\nsmall package, by calling upon me. His story was told in a few words;\nthe package was placed upon my table, and I was again left to my\nmeditations.\n\nTwo or three days before, a man who had the appearance of a “tramp” had\nbeen observed by the people of a small village in the neighborhood. He\nstopped and looked at the houses in a vacant way, walked back and forth\nonce or twice as if uncertain which of the cross-roads to take, and\npresently went on without begging or even speaking to any one. Towards\nsunset a farmer, on his way to the village store, found him sitting at\nthe roadside, his head resting against a fence-post. The man's face was\nso worn and exhausted that the farmer kindly stopped and addressed him;\nbut he gave no other reply than a shake of the head.\n\nThe farmer thereupon lifted him into his light country-wagon, the man\noffering no resistance, and drove to the tavern, where, his exhaustion\nbeing so evident, a glass of whiskey was administered to him. He\nafterwards spoke a few words in German, which no one understood. At the\nalmshouse, to which he was transported the same evening, he refused to\nanswer the customary questions, although he appeared to understand\nthem. The physician was obliged to use a slight degree of force in\nadministering nourishment and medicine, but neither was of any avail.\nThe man died within twenty-four hours after being received. His pockets\nwere empty, but two small leathern wallets were found under his pillow;\nand these formed the package which the director left in my charge. They\nwere full of papers in a foreign language, he said, and he supposed I\nmight be able to ascertain the stranger's name and home from them.\n\nI took up the wallets, which were worn and greasy from long service,\nopened them, and saw that they were filled with scraps, fragments, and\nfolded pieces of paper, nearly every one of which had been carried for\na long time loose in the pocket. Some were written in pen and ink,\nand some in pencil, but all were equally brown, worn, and unsavory in\nappearance. In turning them over, however, my eye was caught by some\nslips in the Russian character, and three or four notes in French;\nthe rest were German. I laid aside “Pitaval” at once, emptied all\nthe leathern pockets carefully, and set about examining the pile of\nmaterial.\n\nI first ran rapidly through the papers to ascertain the dead man's name,\nbut it was nowhere to be found. There were half a dozen letters, written\non sheets folded and addressed in the fashion which prevailed before\nenvelopes were invented; but the name was cut out of the address in\nevery case. There was an official permit to embark on board a Bremen\nsteamer, mutilated in the same way; there was a card photograph, from\nwhich the face had been scratched by a penknife. There were Latin\nsentences; accounts of expenses; a list of New York addresses, covering\neight pages; and a number of notes, written either in Warsaw or Breslau.\nA more incongruous collection I never saw, and I am sure that had it not\nbeen for the train of thought I was pursuing when the director called\nupon me, I should have returned the papers to him without troubling my\nhead with any attempt to unravel the man's story.\n\nThe evidence, however, that he had endeavored to hide his life, had been\nrevealed by my first superficial examination; and here, I reflected,\nwas a singular opportunity to test both his degree of success and my own\npower of constructing a coherent history out of the detached fragments.\nUnpromising as is the matter, said I, let me see whether he can conceal\nhis secret from even such unpractised eyes as mine.\n\nI went through the papers again, read each one rapidly, and arranged\nthem in separate files, according to the character of their contents.\nThen I rearranged these latter in the order of time, so far as it\nwas indicated; and afterwards commenced the work of picking out and\nthreading together whatever facts might be noted. The first thing I\nascertained, or rather conjectured, was that the man's life might be\ndivided into three very distinct phases, the first ending in Breslau,\nthe second in Poland, and the third and final one in America. Thereupon\nI once again rearranged the material, and attacked that which related to\nthe first phase.\n\nIt consisted of the following papers: Three letters, in a female hand,\ncommencing “My dear brother,” and terminating with “Thy loving sister,\nElise;” part of a diploma from a gymnasium, or high school, certifying\nthat [here the name was cut out] had successfully passed his\nexamination, and was competent to teach,--and here again, whether by\naccident or design, the paper was torn off; a note, apparently to a\njeweller, ordering a certain gold ring to be delivered to “Otto,” and\nsigned “B. V. H.;” a receipt from the package-post for a box forwarded\nto Warsaw, to the address of Count Ladislas Kasincsky; and finally\na washing-list, at the bottom of which was written, in pencil, in a\ntrembling hand: “May God protect thee! But do not stay away so very\nlong.”\n\nIn the second collection, relating to Poland, I found the following: Six\norders in Russian and three in French, requesting somebody to send by\n“Jean” sums of money, varying from two to eight hundred rubles. These\norders were in the same hand, and all signed “Y.” A charming letter in\nFrench, addressed “cher ami,” and declining, in the most delicate and\ntender way, an offer of marriage made to the sister of the writer, of\nwhose signature only “Amelie de” remained, the family name having been\ntorn off. A few memoranda of expenses, one of which was curious: “Dinner\nwith Jean, 58 rubles;” and immediately after it: “Doctor, 10 rubles.”\n There were, moreover, a leaf torn out of a journal, and half of a note\nwhich had been torn down the middle, both implicating “Jean” in some way\nwith the fortunes of the dead man.\n\nThe papers belonging to the American phase, so far as they were to be\nidentified by dates, or by some internal evidence, were fewer, but even\nmore enigmatical in character. The principal one was a list of addresses\nin New York, divided into sections, the street boundaries of which were\ngiven. There were no names, but some of the addresses were marked +, and\nothers?, and a few had been crossed out with a pencil. Then there were\nsome leaves of a journal of diet and bodily symptoms, of a very singular\ncharacter; three fragments of drafts of letters, in pencil, one of\nthem commencing, “Dog and villain!” and a single note of “Began work,\nSeptember 10th, 1865.” This was about a year before his death.\n\nThe date of the diploma given by the gymnasium at Breslau was June 27,\n1855, and the first date in Poland was May 3, 1861. Belonging to the\ntime between these two periods there were only the order for the ring\n(1858), and a little memorandum in pencil, dated “Posen, Dec., 1859.”\n The last date in Poland was March 18, 1863, and the permit to embark at\nBremen was dated in October of that year. Here, at least, was a slight\nchronological framework. The physician who attended the county almshouse\nhad estimated the man's age at thirty, which, supposing him to have been\nnineteen at the time of receiving the diploma, confirmed the dates to\nthat extent.\n\nI assumed, at the start, that the name which had been so carefully cut\nout of all the documents was the man's own. The “Elise” of the letters\nwas therefore his sister. The first two letters related merely to\n“mother's health,” and similar details, from which it was impossible to\nextract any thing, except that the sister was in some kind of service.\nThe second letter closed with: “I have enough work to do, but I keep\nwell. Forget thy disappointment so far as _I_ am concerned, for I never\nexpected any thing; I don't know why, but I never did.”\n\nHere was a disappointment, at least, to begin with. I made a note of it\nopposite the date, on my blank programme, and took up the next letter.\nIt was written in November, 1861, and contained a passage which keenly\nexcited my curiosity. It ran thus: “Do, pray, be more careful of thy\nmoney. It may be all as thou sayest, and inevitable, but I dare not\nmention the thing to mother, and five thalers is all I can spare out\nof my own wages. As for thy other request, I have granted it, as thou\nseest, but it makes me a little anxious. What is the joke? And how can\nit serve thee? That is what I do not understand, and I have plagued\nmyself not a little to guess.”\n\nAmong the Polish memoranda was this: “Sept. 1 to Dec. 1, 200 rubles,”\n which I assumed to represent a salary. This would give him eight hundred\na year, at least twelve times the amount which his sister--who must\neither have been cook or housekeeper, since she spoke of going to market\nfor the family--could have received. His application to her for money,\nand the manner of her reference to it, indicated some imprudence or\nirregularity on his part. What the “other request” was, I could\nnot guess; but as I was turning and twisting the worn leaf in some\nperplexity, I made a sudden discovery. One side of the bottom edge had\nbeen very slightly doubled over in folding, and as I smoothed it out, I\nnoticed some diminutive letters in the crease. The paper had been worn\nnearly through, but I made out the words: “Write very soon, dear Otto!”\n\nThis was the name in the order for the gold ring, signed “B. V. H.”--a\nlink, indeed, but a fresh puzzle. Knowing the stubborn prejudices of\ncaste in Germany, and above all in Eastern Prussia and Silesia, I should\nhave been compelled to accept “Otto,” whose sister was in service,\nas himself the servant of “B. V. H.,” but for the tenderly respectful\nletter of “Amelie de----,” declining the marriage offer for her sister.\nI re-read this letter very carefully, to determine whether it was really\nintended for “Otto.” It ran thus:\n\n\n    “DEAR FRIEND,--I will not say that your letter was entirely\n    unexpected, either to Helmine or myself.  I should, perhaps, have\n    less faith in the sincerity of your attachment if you had not\n    already involuntarily betrayed it.  When I say that although I\n    detected the inclination of your heart some weeks ago, and that I\n    also saw it was becoming evident to my sister, yet I refrained from\n    mentioning the subject at all until she came to me last evening\n    with your letter in her hand,--when I say this, you will understand\n    that I have acted towards you with the respect and sympathy which\n    I profoundly feel.  Helmine fully shares this feeling, and her poor\n    heart is too painfully moved to allow her to reply.  Do I not say,\n    in saying this, what her reply must be?  But, though her heart\n    cannot respond to your love, she hopes you will always believe her\n    a friend to whom your proffered devotion was an honor, and will\n    be--if you will subdue it to her deserts--a grateful thing to\n    remember.  We shall remain in Warsaw a fortnight longer, as I think\n    yourself will agree that it is better we should not\n    immediately return to the castle.  Jean, who must carry a fresh\n    order already, will bring you this, and we hope to have good news\n    of Henri.  I send back the papers, which were unnecessary; we never\n    doubted you, and we shall of course keep your secret so long as you\n    choose to wear it.\n                                        “AMELIE DE----”\n\n\nThe more light I seemed to obtain, the more inexplicable the\ncircumstances became. The diploma and the note of salary were grounds\nfor supposing that “Otto” occupied the position of tutor in a noble\nPolish family. There was the receipt for a box addressed to Count\nLadislas Kasincsky, and I temporarily added his family name to the\nwriter of the French letter, assuming her to be his wife. “Jean”\n appeared to be a servant, and “Henri” I set down as the son whom Otto\nwas instructing in the castle or family seat in the country, while the\nparents were in warsaw. Plausible, so far; but the letter was not such\na one as a countess would have written to her son's tutor, under similar\ncircumstances. It was addressed to a social equal, apparently to a man\nyounger than herself, and for whom--supposing him to have been a tutor,\nsecretary, or something of the kind--she must have felt a special\nsympathy. Her mention of “the papers” and “your secret” must refer to\ncircumstances which would explain the mystery. “So long as you choose to\nWEAR it,” she had written: then it was certainly a secret connected with\nhis personal history.\n\nFurther, it appeared that “Jean” was sent to him with “an order.” What\ncould this be, but one of the nine orders for money which lay before my\neyes? I examined the dates of the latter, and lo! there was one written\nupon the same day as the lady's letter. The sums drawn by these orders\namounted in all to four thousand two hundred rubles. But how should a\ntutor or secretary be in possession of his employer's money? Still, this\nmight be accounted for; it would imply great trust on the part of the\nlatter, but no more than one man frequently reposes in another. Yet, if\nit were so, one of the memoranda confronted me with a conflicting\nfact: “Dinner with Jean, 58 rubles.” The unusual amount--nearly fifty\ndollars--indicated an act of the most reckless dissipation, and in\ncompany with a servant, if “Jean,” as I could scarcely doubt, acted in\nthat character. I finally decided to assume both these conjectures as\ntrue, and apply them to the remaining testimony.\n\nI first took up the leaf which had been torn out of a small journal or\npocket note-book, as was manifested by the red edge on three sides.\nIt was scribbled over with brief notes in pencil, written at different\ntimes. Many of them were merely mnemonic signs; but the recurrence of\nthe letters J and Y seemed to point to transactions with “Jean,” and the\ndrawer of the various sums of money. The letter Y reminded me that I\nhad been too hasty in giving the name of Kasincsky to the noble family;\nindeed, the name upon the post-office receipt might have no connection\nwith the matter I was trying to investigate.\n\nSuddenly I noticed a “Ky” among the mnemonic signs, and the suspicion\nflashed across my mind that Count Kasincsky had signed the order with\nthe last letter of his family name! To assume this, however, suggested\na secret reason for doing so; and I began to think that I had already\nsecrets enough on hand.\n\nThe leaf was much rubbed and worn, and it was not without considerable\ntrouble that I deciphered the following (omitting the unintelligible\nsigns):\n\n“Oct. 30 (Nov. 12)--talk with Y; 20--Jean. Consider.\n\n“Nov. 15--with J--H--hope.\n\n“Dec. 1--Told the C. No knowledge of S--therefore safe. Uncertain of----\nC to Warsaw. Met J. as agreed. Further and further.\n\n“Dec. 27--All for naught! All for naught!\n\n“Jan. 19, '63--Sick. What is to be the end? Threats. No tidings of Y.\nWalked the streets all day. At night as usual.\n\n“March 1--News. The C. and H. left yesterday. No more to hope. Let it\ncome, then!”\n\n\nThese broken words warmed my imagination powerfully. Looking at them in\nthe light of my conjecture, I was satisfied that “Otto” was involved\nin some crime, or dangerous secret, of which “Jean” was either the\ninstigator or the accomplice. “Y.,” or Count Kasincsky,--and I was more\nthan ever inclined to connect the two,---also had his mystery, which\nmight, or might not, be identical with the first. By comparing dates, I\nfound that the entry made December 27 was three days later than the date\nof the letter of “Amelie de----“; and the exclamation “All for naught!”\n certainly referred to the disappointment it contained. I now guessed\nthe “H.” in the second entry to mean “Helmine.” The two last suggested\na removal to Warsaw from the country. Here was a little more ground to\nstand on; but how should I ever get at the secret?\n\nI took up the torn half of a note, which, after the first inspection,\nI had laid aside as a hopeless puzzle. A closer examination revealed\nseveral things which failed to impress me at the outset. It was written\nin a strong and rather awkward masculine hand; several words were\nunderscored, two misspelled, and I felt--I scarcely knew why--that it\nwas written in a spirit of mingled contempt and defiance. Let me give\nthe fragment just as it lay before me:\n\n\n“ARON!\n\n       It is quite time\n              be done.  Who knows\n             is not his home by this\n           CONCERN FOR THE\n             that they are well off,\n           sian officers are\n              cide at once, my\n              risau, or I must\n             t TEN DAYS DELAY\n             money can be divi-\n            tier, and you may\n              ever you please.\n              untess goes, and she\n            will know who you\n                    time, unless you carry\n           friend or not\n                decide,\n                   ann Helm.”\n\n\nHere, I felt sure, was the clue to much of the mystery. The first thing\nthat struck me was the appearance of a new name. I looked at it again,\nran through in my mind all possible German names, and found that it\ncould only be “Johann,”--and in the same instant I recalled the frequent\nhabit of the Prussian and Polish nobility of calling their German valets\nby French names. This, then, was “Jean!” The address was certainly\n“Baron,” and why thrice underscored, unless in contemptuous satire?\nLight began to break upon the matter at last. “Otto” had been playing\nthe part, perhaps assuming the name, of a nobleman, seduced to the\ndeception by his passion for the Countess' sister, Helmine. This\nexplained the reference to “the papers,” and “the secret,” and would\naccount for the respectful and sympathetic tone of the Countess' letter.\nBut behind this there was certainly another secret, in which “Y.”\n (whoever he might be) was concerned, and which related to money. The\nclose of the note, which I filled out to read, “Your friend or not, as\nyou may decide,” conveyed a threat, and, to judge from the halves of\nlines immediately preceding it, the threat referred to the money, as\nwell as to the betrayal of an assumed character.\n\nHere, just as the story began to appear in faint outline, my discoveries\nstopped for a while. I ascertained the breadth of the original note by a\npart of the middle-crease which remained, filled out the torn part\nwith blank paper, completed the divided words in the same character of\nmanuscript, and endeavored to guess the remainder, but no clairvoyant\npower of divination came to my aid. I turned over the letters again,\nremarking the neatness with which the addresses had been cut off, and\nwondering why the man had not destroyed the letters and other memoranda\nentirely, if he wished to hide a possible crime. The fact that they were\nnot destroyed showed the hold which his past life had had upon him even\nto his dying hour. Weak and vain, as I had already suspected him to\nbe,--wanting in all manly fibre, and of the very material which a keen,\nenergetic villain would mould to his needs,--I felt that his love for\nhis sister and for “Helmine,” and other associations connected with his\nlife in Germany and Poland, had made him cling to these worn records.\n\nI know not what gave me the suspicion that he had not even found the\nheart to destroy the exscinded names; perhaps the care with which they\nhad been removed; perhaps, in two instances, the circumstance of their\ntaking words out of the body of the letters with them. But the suspicion\ncame, and led to a re-examination of the leathern wallets. I could\nscarcely believe my eyes, when feeling something rustle faintly as I\npressed the thin lining of an inner pocket, I drew forth three or four\nsmall pellets of paper, and unrolling them, found the lost addresses!\nI fitted them to the vacant places, and found that the first letters of\nthe sister in Breslau had been forwarded to “Otto Lindenschmidt,” while\nthe letter to Poland was addressed “Otto von Herisau.”\n\nI warmed with this success, which exactly tallied with the previous\ndiscoveries, and returned again to the Polish memoranda The words\n“[Rus]sian officers” in “Jean's” note led me to notice that it had\nbeen written towards the close of the last insurrection in Poland--a\ncircumstance which I immediately coupled with some things in the note\nand on the leaf of the journal. “No tidings of Y” might indicate that\nCount Kasincsky had been concerned in the rebellion, and had fled, or\nbeen taken prisoner. Had he left a large amount of funds in the hands\nof the supposed Otto von Herisau, which were drawn from time to time by\norders, the form of which had been previously agreed upon? Then, when he\nhad disappeared, might it not have been the remaining funds which Jean\nurged Otto to divide with him, while the latter, misled and entangled in\ndeception rather than naturally dishonest, held back from such a step?\nI could hardly doubt so much, and it now required but a slight effort of\nthe imagination to complete the torn note.\n\nThe next letter of the sister was addressed to Bremen. After having\nestablished so many particulars, I found it easily intelligible. “I have\ndone what I can,” she wrote. “I put it in this letter; it is all I have.\nBut do not ask me for money again; mother is ailing most of the time,\nand I have not yet dared to tell her all. I shall suffer great anxiety\nuntil I hear that the vessel has sailed. My mistress is very good; she\nhas given me an advance on my wages, or I could not have sent thee any\nthing. Mother thinks thou art still in Leipzig: why didst thou stay\nthere so long? but no difference; thy money would have gone anyhow.”\n\nIt was nevertheless singular that Otto should be without money, so soon\nafter the appropriation of Count Kasincsky's funds. If the “20” in\nthe first memorandum on the leaf meant “twenty thousand rubles,” as I\nconjectured, and but four thousand two hundred were drawn by the Count\nprevious to his flight or imprisonment, Otto's half of the remainder\nwould amount to nearly eight thousand rubles; and it was, therefore, not\neasy to account for his delay in Leipzig, and his destitute condition.\n\nBefore examining the fragments relating to the American phase of\nhis life,--which illustrated his previous history only by occasional\nrevelations of his moods and feelings,--I made one more effort to guess\nthe cause of his having assumed the name of “Von Herisau.” The initials\nsigned to the order for the ring (“B. V. H.”) certainly stood for the\nsame family name; and the possession of papers belonging to one of\nthe family was an additional evidence that Otto had either been in the\nservice of, or was related to, some Von Herisau. Perhaps a sentence in\none of the sister's letters--“Forget thy disappointment so far as _I_ am\nconcerned, for I never expected any thing”--referred to something of the\nkind. On the whole, service seemed more likely than kinship; but in that\ncase the papers must have been stolen.\n\nI had endeavored, from the start, to keep my sympathies out of the\ninvestigation, lest they should lead me to misinterpret the broken\nevidence, and thus defeat my object. It must have been the Countess'\nletter, and the brief, almost stenographic, signs of anxiety and\nunhappiness on the leaf of the journal, that first beguiled me into a\ncommiseration, which the simple devotion and self-sacrifice of the poor,\ntoiling sister failed to neutralize. However, I detected the feeling at\nthis stage of the examination, and turned to the American records, in\norder to get rid of it.\n\nThe principal paper was the list of addresses of which I have spoken. I\nlooked over it in vain, to find some indication of its purpose; yet it\nhad been carefully made out and much used. There was no name of a person\nupon it,--only numbers and streets, one hundred and thirty-eight in all.\nFinally, I took these, one by one, to ascertain if any of the houses\nwere known to me, and found three, out of the whole number, to be the\nresidences of persons whom I knew. One was a German gentleman, and the\nother two were Americans who had visited Germany. The riddle was read!\nDuring a former residence in New York, I had for a time been quite\noverrun by destitute Germans,--men, apparently, of some culture, who\nrepresented themselves as theological students, political refugees,\nor unfortunate clerks and secretaries,--soliciting assistance. I found\nthat, when I gave to one, a dozen others came within the next fortnight;\nwhen I refused, the persecution ceased for about the same length of\ntime. I became convinced, at last, that these persons were members of an\norganized society of beggars, and the result proved it; for when I\nmade it an inviolable rule to give to no one who could not bring me an\nindorsement of his need by some person whom I knew, the annoyance ceased\naltogether.\n\nThe meaning of the list of addresses was now plain. My nascent\ncommiseration for the man was not only checked, but I was in danger of\nchanging my role from that of culprit's counsel to that of prosecuting\nattorney.\n\nWhen I took up again the fragment of the first draught of a letter\ncommencing, “Dog and villain!” and applied it to the words “Jean” or\n“Johann Helm,” the few lines which could be deciphered became full of\nmeaning. “Don't think,” it began, “that I have forgotten you, or the\ntrick you played me! If I was drunk or drugged the last night, I know\nhow it happened, for all that. I left, but I shall go back. And if you\nmake use of” (here some words were entirely obliterated).... “is true.\nHe gave me the ring, and meant”.... This was all I could make out. The\nother papers showed only scattered memoranda, of money, or appointments,\nor addresses, with the exception of the diary in pencil.\n\nI read the letter attentively, and at first with very little idea of\nits meaning. Many of the words were abbreviated, and there were some\narbitrary signs. It ran over a period of about four months, terminating\nsix weeks before the man's death. He had been wandering about the\ncountry during this period, sleeping in woods and barns, and living\nprincipally upon milk. The condition of his pulse and other physical\nfunctions was scrupulously set down, with an occasional remark of “good”\n or “bad.” The conclusion was at last forced upon me that he had been\nendeavoring to commit suicide by a slow course of starvation and\nexposure. Either as the cause or the result of this attempt, I read, in\nthe final notes, signs of an aberration of mind. This also explained\nthe singular demeanor of the man when found, and his refusal to take\nmedicine or nourishment. He had selected a long way to accomplish his\npurpose, but had reached the end at last.\n\nThe confused material had now taken shape; the dead man, despite his\nwill, had confessed to me his name and the chief events of his life.\nIt now remained--looking at each event as the result of a long chain of\ncauses--to deduce from them the elements of his individual character,\nand then fill up the inevitable gaps in the story from the probabilities\nof the operation of those elements. This was not so much a mere venture\nas the reader may suppose, because the two actions of the mind test\neach other. If they cannot, thus working towards a point and back again,\nactually discover what WAS, they may at least fix upon a very probable\nMIGHT HAVE BEEN.\n\nA person accustomed to detective work would have obtained my little\nstock of facts with much less trouble, and would, almost instinctively,\nhave filled the blanks as he went along. Being an apprentice in such\nmatters, I had handled the materials awkwardly. I will not here retrace\nmy own mental zigzags between character and act, but simply repeat the\nstory as I finally settled and accepted it.\n\nOtto Lindenschmidt was the child of poor parents in or near Breslau. His\nfather died when he was young; his mother earned a scanty subsistence\nas a washerwoman; his sister went into service. Being a bright,\nhandsome boy, he attracted the attention of a Baron von Herisau, an old,\nchildless, eccentric gentleman, who took him first as page or attendant,\nintending to make him a superior valet de chambre. Gradually, however,\nthe Baron fancied that he detected in the boy a capacity for better\nthings; his condescending feeling of protection had grown into an\nattachment for the handsome, amiable, grateful young fellow, and he\nplaced him in the gymnasium at Breslau, perhaps with the idea, now, of\neducating him to be an intelligent companion.\n\nThe boy and his humble relatives, dazzled by this opportunity, began\nsecretly to consider the favor as almost equivalent to his adoption as\na son. (The Baron had once been married, but his wife and only child had\nlong been dead.) The old man, of course, came to look upon the growing\nintelligence of the youth as his own work: vanity and affection became\ninextricably blended in his heart, and when the cursus was over, he took\nhim home as the companion of his lonely life. After two or three\nyears, during which the young man was acquiring habits of idleness and\nindulgence, supposing his future secure, the Baron died,--perhaps too\nsuddenly to make full provision for him, perhaps after having kept up\nthe appearance of wealth on a life-annuity, but, in any case, leaving\nvery little, if any, property to Otto. In his disappointment, the latter\nretained certain family papers which the Baron had intrusted to his\nkeeping. The ring was a gift, and he wore it in remembrance of his\nbenefactor.\n\nWandering about, Micawber-like, in hopes that something might turn up,\nhe reached Posen, and there either met or heard of the Polish Count,\nLadislas Kasincsky, who was seeking a tutor for his only son. His\naccomplishments, and perhaps, also, a certain aristocratic grace of\nmanner unconsciously caught from the Baron von Herisau, speedily won for\nhim the favor of the Count and Countess Kasincsky, and emboldened him to\nhope for the hand of the Countess' sister, Helmine ----, to whom he was\nno doubt sincerely attached. Here Johann Helm, or “Jean,” a confidential\nservant of the Count, who looked upon the new tutor as a rival,\nyet adroitly flattered his vanity for the purpose of misleading and\ndisplacing him, appears upon the stage. “Jean” first detected Otto's\npassion; “Jean,” at an epicurean dinner, wormed out of Otto the secret\nof the Herisau documents, and perhaps suggested the part which the\nlatter afterwards played.\n\nThis “Jean” seemed to me to have been the evil agency in the miserable\nhistory which followed. After Helmine's rejection of Otto's suit, and\nthe flight or captivity of Count Kasincsky, leaving a large sum of money\nin Otto's hands, it would be easy for “Jean,” by mingled persuasions and\nthreats, to move the latter to flight, after dividing the money still\nremaining in his hands. After the theft, and the partition, which took\nplace beyond the Polish frontier, “Jean” in turn, stole his accomplice's\nshare, together with the Von Herisau documents.\n\nExile and a year's experience of organized mendicancy did the rest.\n\nOtto Lindenschmidt was one of those natures which possess no moral\nelasticity--which have neither the power nor the comprehension\nof atonement. The first real, unmitigated guilt--whether great\nor small--breaks them down hopelessly. He expected no chance of\nself-redemption, and he found none. His life in America was so utterly\ndark and hopeless that the brightest moment in it must have been that\nwhich showed him the approach of death.\n\nMy task was done. I had tracked this weak, vain, erring, hunted soul to\nits last refuge, and the knowledge bequeathed to me but a single duty.\nHis sins were balanced by his temptations; his vanity and weakness\nhad revenged themselves; and there only remained to tell the simple,\nfaithful sister that her sacrifices were no longer required. I burned\nthe evidences of guilt, despair and suicide, and sent the other\npapers, with a letter relating the time and circumstances of Otto\nLindenschmidt's death, to the civil authorities of Breslau, requesting\nthat they might be placed in the hands of his sister Elise.\n\nThis, I supposed, was the end of the history, so far as my connection\nwith it was concerned. But one cannot track a secret with impunity;\nthe fatality connected with the act and the actor clings even to the\nknowledge of the act. I had opened my door a little, in order to look\nout upon the life of another, but in doing so a ghost had entered in,\nand was not to be dislodged until I had done its service.\n\nIn the summer of 1867 I was in Germany, and during a brief journey\nof idlesse and enjoyment came to the lovely little watering-place of\nLiebenstein, on the southern slope of the Thuringian Forest. I had no\nexpectation or even desire of making new acquaintances among the gay\ncompany who took their afternoon coffee under the noble linden trees on\nthe terrace; but, within the first hour of my after-dinner leisure, I\nwas greeted by an old friend, an author, from Coburg, and carried away,\nin my own despite, to a group of his associates. My friend and his\nfriends had already been at the place a fortnight, and knew the very\ntint and texture of its gossip. While I sipped my coffee, I listened\nto them with one ear, and to Wagner's overture to “Lohengrin” with\nthe other; and I should soon have been wholly occupied with the fine\norchestra had I not been caught and startled by an unexpected name.\n\n“Have you noticed,” some one asked, “how much attention the Baron von\nHerisau is paying her?”\n\nI whirled round and exclaimed, in a breath, “The Baron von Herisau!”\n\n“Yes,” said my friend; “do you know him?”\n\nI was glad that three crashing, tremendous chords came from the\norchestra just then, giving me time to collect myself before I replied:\n“I am not sure whether it is the same person: I knew a Baron von Herisau\nlong ago: how old is the gentleman here?”\n\n“About thirty-five, I should think,” my friend answered.\n\n“Ah, then it can't be the same person,” said I: “still, if he should\nhappen to pass near us, will you point him out to me?”\n\nIt was an hour later, and we were all hotly discussing the question of\nLessing's obligations to English literature, when one of the gentlemen\nat the table said: “There goes the Baron von Herisau: is it perhaps your\nfriend, sir?”\n\nI turned and saw a tall man, with prominent nose, opaque black eyes, and\nblack mustache, walking beside a pretty, insipid girl. Behind the\npair went an elderly couple, overdressed and snobbish in appearance. A\ncarriage, with servants in livery, waited in the open space below the\nterrace, and having received the two couples, whirled swiftly away\ntowards Altenstein.\n\nHad I been more of a philosopher I should have wasted no second thought\non the Baron von Herisau. But the Nemesis of the knowledge which I had\nthrottled poor Otto Lindenschmidt's ghost to obtain had come upon me at\nlast, and there was no rest for me until I had discovered who and what\nwas the Baron. The list of guests which the landlord gave me whetted\nmy curiosity to a painful degree; for on it I found the entry: “Aug.\n15.--Otto V. Herisau, Rentier, East Prussia.”\n\nIt was quite dark when the carriage returned. I watched the company into\nthe supper-room, and then, whisking in behind them, secured a place at\nthe nearest table. I had an hour of quiet, stealthy observation before\nmy Coburg friend discovered me, and by that time I was glad of his\ncompany and had need of his confidence. But, before making use of him in\nthe second capacity, I desired to make the acquaintance of the adjoining\npartie carree. He had bowed to them familiarly in passing, and when the\nold gentleman said, “Will you not join us, Herr ----?” I answered my\nfriend's interrogative glance with a decided affirmative, and we moved\nto the other table.\n\nMy seat was beside the Baron von Herisau, with whom I exchanged the\nusual commonplaces after an introduction. His manner was cold and\ntaciturn, I thought, and there was something forced in the smile which\naccompanied his replies to the remarks of the coarse old lady, who\ncontinually referred to the “Herr Baron” as authority upon every\npossible subject. I noticed, however, that he cast a sudden, sharp\nglance at me, when I was presented to the company as an American.\n\nThe man's neighborhood disturbed me. I was obliged to let the\nconversation run in the channels already selected, and stupid enough I\nfound them. I was considering whether I should not give a signal to my\nfriend and withdraw, when the Baron stretched his hand across the table\nfor a bottle of Affenthaler, and I caught sight of a massive gold ring\non his middle finger. Instantly I remembered the ring which “B. V. H.”\n had given to Otto Lindenschmidt, and I said to myself, “That is it!”\n The inference followed like lightning that it was “Johann Helm” who sat\nbeside me, and not a Baron von Herisau!\n\n\nThat evening my friend and I had a long, absorbing conversation in my\nroom. I told him the whole story, which came back vividly to memory, and\nlearned, in return, that the reputed Baron was supposed to be wealthy,\nthat the old gentleman was a Bremen merchant or banker, known to be\nrich, that neither was considered by those who had met them to be\nparticularly intelligent or refined, and that the wooing of the daughter\nhad already become so marked as to be a general subject of gossip.\nMy friend was inclined to think my conjecture correct, and willingly\nco-operated with me in a plan to test the matter. We had no considerable\nsympathy with the snobbish parents, whose servility to a title was\nso apparent; but the daughter seemed to be an innocent and amiable\ncreature, however silly, and we determined to spare her the shame of an\nopen scandal.\n\nIf our scheme should seem a little melodramatic, it must not be\nforgotten that my friend was an author. The next morning, as the Baron\ncame up the terrace after his visit to the spring, I stepped forward and\ngreeted him politely, after which I said: “I see by the strangers' list\nthat you are from East Prussia, Baron; have you ever been in Poland?” At\nthat moment, a voice behind him called out rather sharply, “Jean!” The\nBaron started, turned round and then back to me, and all his art\ncould not prevent the blood from rushing to his face. I made, as if by\naccident, a gesture with my hand, indicating success, and went a step\nfurther.\n\n“Because,” said I, “I am thinking of making a visit to Cracow and\nWarsaw, and should be glad of any information--”\n\n“Certainly!” he interrupted me, “and I should be very glad to give it,\nif I had ever visited Poland.”\n\n“At least,” I continued, “you can advise me upon one point; but excuse\nme, shall we not sit down a moment yonder? As my question relates to\nmoney, I should not wish to be overheard.”\n\nI pointed out a retired spot, just before reaching which we were joined\nby my friend, who suddenly stepped out from behind a clump of lilacs.\nThe Baron and he saluted each other.\n\n“Now,” said I to the former, “I can ask your advice, Mr. Johann Helm!”\n\nHe was not an adept, after all. His astonishment and confusion were\nbrief, to be sure, but they betrayed him so completely that his\nafter-impulse to assume a haughty, offensive air only made us smile.\n\n“If I had a message to you from Otto Lindenschmidt, what then?” I asked.\n\nHe turned pale, and presently stammered out, “He--he is dead!”\n\n“Now,” said my friend, “it is quite time to drop the mask before us. You\nsee we know you, and we know your history. Not from Otto Lindenschmidt\nalone; Count Ladislas Kasincsky--”\n\n“What! Has he come back from Siberia?” exclaimed Johann Helm. His face\nexpressed abject terror; I think he would have fallen upon his knees\nbefore us if he had not somehow felt, by a rascal's instinct, that we\nhad no personal wrongs to redress in unmasking him.\n\nOur object, however, was to ascertain through him the complete facts of\nOtto Lindenschmidt's history, and then to banish him from Liebenstein.\nWe allowed him to suppose for awhile that we were acting under the\nauthority of persons concerned, in order to make the best possible use\nof his demoralized mood, for we knew it would not last long.\n\nMy guesses were very nearly correct. Otto Lindenschmidt had been\neducated by an old Baron, Bernhard von Herisau, on account of his\nresemblance in person to a dead son, whose name had also been Otto.\n\nHe could not have adopted the plebeian youth, at least to the extent\nof giving him an old and haughty name, but this the latter nevertheless\nexpected, up to the time of the Baron's death. He had inherited a\nlittle property from his benefactor, but soon ran through it. “He was\na light-headed fellow,” said Johann Helm, “but he knew how to get\nthe confidence of the old Junkers. If he hadn't been so cowardly and\nfidgety, he might have made himself a career.”\n\nThe Polish episode differed so little from my interpretation that I need\nnot repeat Helm's version. He denied having stolen Otto's share of the\nmoney, but could not help admitting his possession of the Von Herisau\npapers, among which were the certificates of birth and baptism of\nthe old Baron's son, Otto. It seems that he had been fearful of\nLindenschmidt's return from America, for he managed to communicate with\nhis sister in Breslau, and in this way learned the former's death. Not\nuntil then had he dared to assume his present disguise.\n\nWe let him go, after exacting a solemn pledge that he would betake\nhimself at once to Hamburg, and there ship for Australia. (I judged that\nAmerica was already amply supplied with individuals of his class.) The\nsudden departure of the Baron von Herisau was a two days' wonder at\nLiebenstein; but besides ourselves, only the Bremen banker knew\nthe secret. He also left, two days afterwards, with his wife and\ndaughter--their cases, it was reported, requiring Kissingen.\n\nOtto Lindenschmidt's life, therefore, could not hide itself. Can any\nlife?\n\n\n\n\nTWIN-LOVE.\n\n\nWhen John Vincent, after waiting twelve years, married Phebe Etheridge,\nthe whole neighborhood experienced that sense of relief and satisfaction\nwhich follows the triumph of the right. Not that the fact of a true love\nis ever generally recognized and respected when it is first discovered;\nfor there is a perverse quality in American human nature which will not\naccept the existence of any fine, unselfish passion, until it has been\ntested and established beyond peradventure. There were two views of the\ncase when John Vincent's love for Phebe, and old Reuben Etheridge's hard\nprohibition of the match, first became known to the community. The girls\nand boys, and some of the matrons, ranged themselves at once on the side\nof the lovers, but a large majority of the older men and a few of the\nyounger supported the tyrannical father.\n\nReuben Etheridge was rich, and, in addition to what his daughter would\nnaturally inherit from him, she already possessed more than her lover,\nat the time of their betrothal. This in the eyes of one class was a\nsufficient reason for the father's hostility. When low natures live\n(as they almost invariably do) wholly in the present, they neither\ntake tenderness from the past nor warning from the possibilities of the\nfuture. It is the exceptional men and women who remember their youth.\nSo, these lovers received a nearly equal amount of sympathy and\ncondemnation; and only slowly, partly through their quiet fidelity and\npatience, and partly through the improvement in John Vincent's\nworldly circumstances, was the balance changed. Old Reuben remained an\nunflinching despot to the last: if any relenting softness touched his\nheart, he sternly concealed it; and such inference as could be drawn\nfrom the fact that he, certainly knowing what would follow his death,\nbequeathed his daughter her proper share of his goods, was all that\ncould be taken for consent.\n\nThey were married: John, a grave man in middle age, weather-beaten\nand worn by years of hard work and self-denial, yet not beyond the\nrestoration of a milder second youth; and Phebe a sad, weary woman,\nwhose warmth of longing had been exhausted, from whom youth and its\nuncalculating surrenders of hope and feeling had gone forever. They\nbegan their wedded life under the shadow of the death out of which\nit grew; and when, after a ceremony in which neither bridesmaid nor\ngroomsman stood by their side, they united their divided homes, it\nseemed to their neighbors that a separated husband and wife had come\ntogether again, not that the relation was new to either.\n\nJohn Vincent loved his wife with the tenderness of an innocent man,\nbut all his tenderness could not avail to lift the weight of settled\nmelancholy which had gathered upon her. Disappointment, waiting,\nyearning, indulgence in long lament and self-pity, the morbid\ncultivation of unhappy fancies--all this had wrought its work upon her,\nand it was too late to effect a cure. In the night she awoke to weep at\nhis side, because of the years when she had awakened to weep alone;\nby day she kept up her old habit of foreboding, although the evening\nsteadily refuted the morning; and there were times when, without any\napparent cause, she would fall into a dark, despairing mood which her\nhusband's greatest care and cunning could only slowly dispel.\n\nTwo or three years passed, and new life came to the Vincent farm. One\nday, between midnight and dawn, the family pair was doubled; the cry of\ntwin sons was heard in the hushed house. The father restrained his happy\nwonder in his concern for the imperilled life of the mother; he guessed\nthat she had anticipated death, and she now hung by a thread so slight\nthat her simple will might snap it. But her will, fortunately, was as\nfaint as her consciousness; she gradually drifted out of danger, taking\nher returning strength with a passive acquiescence rather than with joy.\nShe was hardly paler than her wont, but the lurking shadow seemed to\nhave vanished from her eyes, and John Vincent felt that her features\nhad assumed a new expression, the faintly perceptible stamp of some\nspiritual change.\n\n\nIt was a happy day for him when, propped against his breast and gently\nheld by his warm, strong arm, the twin boys were first brought to be\nlaid upon her lap. Two staring, dark-faced creatures, with restless\nfists and feet, they were alike in every least feature of their\ngrotesque animality. Phebe placed a hand under the head of each, and\nlooked at them for a long time in silence.\n\n“Why is this?” she said, at last, taking hold of a narrow pink ribbon,\nwhich was tied around the wrist of one.\n\n“He's the oldest, sure,” the nurse answered. “Only by fifteen minutes or\nso, but it generally makes a difference when twins come to be named;\nand you may see with your own eyes that there's no telling of 'em apart\notherways.”\n\n“Take off the ribbon, then,” said Phebe quietly; “_I_ know them.”\n\n“Why, ma'am, it's always done, where they're so like! And I'll never\nbe able to tell which is which; for they sleep and wake and feed by the\nsame clock. And you might mistake, after all, in giving 'em names--”\n\n“There is no oldest or youngest, John; they are two and yet one: this is\nmine, and this is yours.”\n\n“I see no difference at all, Phebe,” said John; “and how can we divide\nthem?”\n\n“We will not divide,” she answered; “I only meant it as a sign.”\n\nShe smiled, for the first time in many days. He was glad of heart, but\ndid not understand her. “What shall we call them?” he asked. “Elias and\nReuben, after our fathers?”\n\n“No, John; their names must be David and Jonathan.”\n\nAnd so they were called. And they grew, not less, but more alike, in\npassing through the stages of babyhood. The ribbon of the older one had\nbeen removed, and the nurse would have been distracted, but for Phebe's\nalmost miraculous instinct. The former comforted herself with the hope\nthat teething would bring a variation to the two identical mouths; but\nno! they teethed as one child. John, after desperate attempts, which\nalways failed in spite of the headaches they gave him, postponed the\nidea of distinguishing one from the other, until they should be old\nenough to develop some dissimilarity of speech, or gait, or habit.\nAll trouble might have been avoided, had Phebe consented to the least\nvariation in their dresses; but herein she was mildly immovable.\n\n“Not yet,” was her set reply to her husband; and one day, when he\nmanifested a little annoyance at her persistence, she turned to him,\nholding a child on each knee, and said with a gravity which silenced\nhim thenceforth: “John, can you not see that our burden has passed into\nthem? Is there no meaning in this--that two children who are one in body\nand face and nature, should be given to us at our time of life, after\nsuch long disappointment and trouble? Our lives were held apart; theirs\nwere united before they were born, and I dare not turn them in different\ndirections. Perhaps I do not know all that the Lord intended to say to\nus, in sending them; but His hand is here!”\n\n“I was only thinking of their good,” John meekly answered. “If they\nare spared to grow up, there must be some way of knowing one from the\nother.”\n\n“THEY will not need it, and I, too, think only of them. They have taken\nthe cross from my heart, and I will lay none on theirs. I am reconciled\nto my life through them, John; you have been very patient and good with\nme, and I will yield to you in all things but in this. I do not think I\nshall live to see them as men grown; yet, while we are together, I feel\nclearly what it is right to do. Can you not, just once, have a little\nfaith without knowledge, John?”\n\n“I'll try, Phebe,” he said. “Any way, I'll grant that the boys belong to\nyou more than to me.”\n\nPhebe Vincent's character had verily changed. Her attacks of\nsemi-hysterical despondency never returned; her gloomy prophecies\nceased. She was still grave, and the trouble of so many years never\nwholly vanished from her face; but she performed every duty of her life\nwith at least a quiet willingness, and her home became the abode of\npeace; for passive content wears longer than demonstrative happiness.\n\nDavid and Jonathan grew as one boy: the taste and temper of one was\nrepeated in the other, even as the voice and features. Sleeping or\nwaking, grieved or joyous, well or ill, they lived a single life, and\nit seemed so natural for one to answer to the other's name, that they\nprobably would have themselves confused their own identities, but for\ntheir mother's unerring knowledge. Perhaps unconsciously guided by her,\nperhaps through the voluntary action of their own natures, each quietly\ntook the other's place when called upon, even to the sharing of praise\nor blame at school, the friendships and quarrels of the playground. They\nwere healthy and happy lads, and John Vincent was accustomed to say\nto his neighbors, “They're no more trouble than one would be; and yet\nthey're four hands instead of two.”\n\nPhebe died when they were fourteen, saying to them, with almost her\nlatest breath, “Be one, always!” Before her husband could decide whether\nto change her plan of domestic education, they were passing out of\nboyhood, changing in voice, stature, and character with a continued\nlikeness which bewildered and almost terrified him. He procured garments\nof different colors, but they were accustomed to wear each article in\ncommon, and the result was only a mixture of tints for both. They were\nsent to different schools, to be returned the next day, equally pale,\nsuffering, and incapable of study. Whatever device was employed, they\nevaded it by a mutual instinct which rendered all external measures\nunavailing. To John Vincent's mind their resemblance was an accidental\nmisfortune, which had been confirmed through their mother's fancy. He\nfelt that they were bound by some deep, mysterious tie, which, inasmuch\nas it might interfere with all practical aspects of life, ought to be\ngradually weakened. Two bodies, to him, implied two distinct men, and\nit was wrong to permit a mutual dependence which prevented either from\nexercising his own separate will and judgment.\n\nBut, while he was planning and pondering, the boys became young men, and\nhe was an old man. Old, and prematurely broken; for he had worked much,\nborne much, and his large frame held only a moderate measure of vital\nforce. A great weariness fell upon him, and his powers began to give\nway, at first slowly, but then with accelerated failure. He saw the end\ncoming, long before his sons suspected it; his doubt, for their sakes,\nwas the only thing which made it unwelcome. It was “upon his mind” (as\nhis Quaker neighbors would say) to speak to them of the future, and at\nlast the proper moment came.\n\nIt was a stormy November evening. Wind and rain whirled and drove among\nthe trees outside, but the sitting-room of the old farm-house was bright\nand warm. David and Jonathan, at the table, with their arms over each\nother's backs and their brown locks mixed together, read from the same\nbook: their father sat in the ancient rocking-chair before the fire,\nwith his feet upon a stool. The housekeeper and hired man had gone to\nbed, and all was still in the house.\n\nJohn waited until he heard the volume closed, and then spoke.\n\n“Boys,” he said, “let me have a bit of talk with you. I don't seem to\nget over my ailments rightly,--never will, maybe. A man must think of\nthings while there's time, and say them when they HAVE to be said. I\ndon't know as there's any particular hurry in my case; only, we never\ncan tell, from one day to another. When I die, every thing will belong\nto you two, share and share alike, either to buy another farm with the\nmoney out, or divide this: I won't tie you up in any way. But two of you\nwill need two farms for two families; for you won't have to wait twelve\nyears, like your mother and me.”\n\n“We don't want another farm, father!” said David and Jonathan together.\n\n“I know you don't think so, now. A wife seemed far enough off from me\nwhen I was your age. You've always been satisfied to be with each other,\nbut that can't last. It was partly your mother's notion; I remember her\nsaying that our burden had passed into you. I never quite understood\nwhat she meant, but I suppose it must rather be the opposite of what WE\nhad to bear.”\n\nThe twins listened with breathless attention while their father,\nsuddenly stirred by the past, told them the story of his long betrothal.\n\n“And now,” he exclaimed, in conclusion, “it may be putting wild\nideas into your two heads, but I must say it! THAT was where I did\nwrong--wrong to her and to me,--in waiting! I had no right to spoil the\nbest of our lives; I ought to have gone boldly, in broad day, to her\nfather's house, taken her by the hand, and led her forth to be my wife.\nBoys, if either of you comes to love a woman truly, and she to love you,\nand there is no reason why God (I don't say man) should put you asunder,\ndo as I ought to have done, not as I did! And, maybe, this advice is the\nbest legacy I can leave you.”\n\n“But, father,” said David, speaking for both, “we have never thought of\nmarrying.”\n\n“Likely enough,” their father answered; “we hardly ever think of what\nsurely comes. But to me, looking back, it's plain. And this is the\nreason why I want you to make me a promise, and as solemn as if I was on\nmy death-bed. Maybe I shall be, soon.”\n\nTears gathered in the eyes of the twins. “What is it, father?” they both\nsaid.\n\n“Nothing at all to any other two boys, but I don't know how YOU'll take\nit. What if I was to ask you to live apart for a while?”\n\n“Oh father!” both cried. They leaned together, cheek pressing cheek, and\nhand clasping hand, growing white and trembling. John Vincent, gazing\ninto the fire, did not see their faces, or his purpose might have been\nshaken.\n\n“I don't say NOW,” he went on. “After a while, when--well, when I'm\ndead. And I only mean a beginning, to help you toward what HAS to be.\nOnly a month; I don't want to seem hard to you; but that's little, in\nall conscience. Give me your word: say, 'For mother's sake!'”\n\nThere was a long pause. Then David and Jonathan said, in low, faltering\nvoices, “For mother's sake, I promise.”\n\n“Remember that you were only boys to her. She might have made all this\nseem easier, for women have reasons for things no man can answer. Mind,\nwithin a year after I'm gone!”\n\nHe rose and tottered out of the room.\n\nThe twins looked at each other: David said, “Must we?” and Jonathan,\n“How can we?” Then they both thought, “It may be a long while yet.” Here\nwas a present comfort, and each seemed to hold it firmly in holding the\nhand of the other, as they fell asleep side by side.\n\nThe trial was nearer than they imagined. Their father died before the\nwinter was over; the farm and other property was theirs, and they might\nhave allowed life to solve its mysteries as it rolled onwards, but for\ntheir promise to the dead. This must be fulfilled, and then--one thing\nwas certain; they would never again separate.\n\n“The sooner the better,” said David. “It shall be the visit to our uncle\nand cousins in Indiana. You will come with me as far as Harrisburg;\nit may be easier to part there than here. And our new neighbors, the\nBradleys, will want your help for a day or two, after getting home.”\n\n“It is less than death,” Jonathan answered, “and why should it seem to\nbe more? We must think of father and mother, and all those twelve years;\nnow I know what the burden was.”\n\n“And we have never really borne any part of it! Father must have been\nright in forcing us to promise.”\n\nEvery day the discussion was resumed, and always with the same\ntermination. Familiarity with the inevitable step gave them increase\nof courage; yet, when the moment had come and gone, when, speeding on\nopposite trains, the hills and valleys multiplied between them with\nterrible velocity, a pang like death cut to the heart of each, and the\ndivided life became a chill, oppressive dream.\n\nDuring the separation no letters passed between them. When the neighbors\nasked Jonathan for news of his brother, he always replied, “He is well,”\n and avoided further speech with such evidence of pain that they spared\nhim. An hour before the month drew to an end, he walked forth alone,\ntaking the road to the nearest railway station. A stranger who passed\nhim at the entrance of a thick wood, three miles from home, was\nthunderstruck on meeting the same person shortly after, entering the\nwood from the other side; but the farmers in the near fields saw two\nfigures issuing from the shade, hand in hand.\n\nEach knew the other's month, before they slept, and the last thing\nJonathan said, with his head on David's shoulder, was, “You must know\nour neighbors, the Bradleys, and especially Ruth.” In the morning,\nas they dressed, taking each other's garments at random, as of old,\nJonathan again said, “I have never seen a girl that I like so well\nas Ruth Bradley. Do you remember what father said about loving and\nmarrying? It comes into my mind whenever I see Ruth; but she has no\nsister.”\n\n“But we need not both marry,” David replied, “that might part us, and\nthis will not. It is for always now.”\n\n“For always, David.”\n\nTwo or three days later Jonathan said, as he started on an errand to the\nvillage: “I shall stop at the Bradleys this evening, so you must walk\nacross and meet me there.”\n\nWhen David approached the house, a slender, girlish figure, with her\nback towards him, was stooping over a bush of great crimson roses,\ncautiously clipping a blossom here and there. At the click of the\ngate-latch she started and turned towards him. Her light gingham bonnet,\nfalling back, disclosed a long oval face, fair and delicate, sweet brown\neyes, and brown hair laid smoothly over the temples. A soft flush rose\nsuddenly to her cheeks, and he felt that his own were burning.\n\n“Oh Jonathan!” she exclaimed, transferring the roses to her left hand,\nand extending her right, as she came forward.\n\nHe was too accustomed to the name to recognize her mistake at once, and\nthe word “Ruth!” came naturally to his lips.\n\n“I should know your brother David has come,” she then said; “even if I\nhad not heard so. You look so bright. How glad I am!”\n\n“Is he not here?” David asked.\n\n“No; but there he is now, surely!” She turned towards the lane, where\nJonathan was dismounting. “Why, it is yourself over again, Jonathan!”\n\nAs they approached, a glance passed between the twins, and a secret\ntransfer of the riding-whip to David set their identity right with\nRuth, whose manner toward the latter innocently became shy with all its\nfriendliness, while her frank, familiar speech was given to Jonathan,\nas was fitting. But David also took the latter to himself, and when they\nleft, Ruth had apparently forgotten that there was any difference in the\nlength of their acquaintance.\n\nOn their way homewards David said: “Father was right. We must marry,\nlike others, and Ruth is the wife for us,--I mean for you, Jonathan.\nYes, we must learn to say MINE and YOURS, after all, when we speak of\nher.”\n\n“Even she cannot separate us, it seems,” Jonathan answered. “We must\ngive her some sign, and that will also be a sign for others. It will\nseem strange to divide ourselves; we can never learn it properly; rather\nlet us not think of marriage.”\n\n“We cannot help thinking of it; she stands in mother's place now, as we\nin father's.”\n\nThen both became silent and thoughtful. They felt that something\nthreatened to disturb what seemed to be the only possible life for them,\nyet were unable to distinguish its features, and therefore powerless\nto resist it. The same instinct which had been born of their wonderful\nspiritual likeness told them that Ruth Bradley already loved Jonathan:\nthe duty was established, and they must conform their lives to it. There\nwas, however, this slight difference between their natures--that David\nwas generally the first to utter the thought which came to the minds of\nboth. So when he said, “We shall learn what to do when the need comes,”\n it was a postponement of all foreboding. They drifted contentedly\ntowards the coming change.\n\nThe days went by, and their visits to Ruth Bradley were continued.\nSometimes Jonathan went alone, but they were usually together, and the\ntie which united the three became dearer and sweeter as it was more\nclosely drawn. Ruth learned to distinguish between the two when they\nwere before her: at least she said so, and they were willing to believe\nit. But she was hardly aware how nearly alike was the happy warmth\nin her bosom produced by either pair of dark gray eyes and the soft\nhalf-smile which played around either mouth. To them she seemed to be\ndrawn within the mystic circle which separated them from others--she,\nalone; and they no longer imagined a life in which she should not share.\n\nThen the inevitable step was taken. Jonathan declared his love, and was\nanswered. Alas! he almost forgot David that late summer evening, as they\nsat in the moonlight, and over and over again assured each other how\ndear they had grown. He felt the trouble in David's heart when they met.\n\n“Ruth is ours, and I bring her kiss to you,” he said, pressing his lips\nto David's; but the arms flung around him trembled, and David whispered,\n“Now the change begins.”\n\n“Oh, this cannot be our burden!” Jonathan cried, with all the rapture\nstill warm in his heart.\n\n“If it is, it will be light, or heavy, or none at all, as we shall bear\nit,” David answered, with a smile of infinite tenderness.\n\nFor several days he allowed Jonathan to visit the Bradley farm alone,\nsaying that it must be so on Ruth's account. Her love, he declared, must\ngive her the fine instinct which only their mother had ever possessed,\nand he must allow it time to be confirmed. Jonathan, however, insisted\nthat Ruth already possessed it; that she was beginning to wonder at his\nabsence, and to fear that she would not be entirely welcome to the home\nwhich must always be equally his.\n\nDavid yielded at once.\n\n“You must go alone,” said Jonathan, “to satisfy yourself that she knows\nus at last.”\n\nRuth came forth from the house as he drew near. Her face beamed; she\nlaid her hands upon his shoulders and kissed him. “Now you cannot doubt\nme, Ruth!” he said, gently.\n\n“Doubt you, Jonathan!” she exclaimed with a fond reproach in her eyes.\n“But you look troubled; is any thing the matter?”\n\n“I was thinking of my brother,” said David, in a low tone.\n\n“Tell me what it is,” she said, drawing him into the little arbor of\nwoodbine near the gate. They took seats side by side on the rustic\nbench. “He thinks I may come between you: is it not that?” she asked.\nOnly one thing was clear to David's mind--that she would surely speak\nmore frankly and freely of him to the supposed Jonathan than to his real\nself. This once he would permit the illusion.\n\n“Not more than must be,” he answered. “He knew all from the very\nbeginning. But we have been like one person in two bodies, and any\nchange seems to divide us.”\n\n“I feel as you do,” said Ruth. “I would never consent to be your wife,\nif I could really divide you. I love you both too well for that.”\n\n“Do you love me?” he asked, entirely forgetting his representative part.\n\nAgain the reproachful look, which faded away as she met his eyes. She\nfell upon his breast, and gave him kisses which were answered with equal\ntenderness. Suddenly he covered his face with his hands, and burst into\na passion of tears.\n\n“Jonathan! Oh Jonathan!” she cried, weeping with alarm and sympathetic\npain.\n\nIt was long before he could speak; but at last, turning away his head,\nhe faltered, “I am David!”\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\nWhen he looked up she was sitting with her hands rigidly clasped in her\nlap: her face was very pale.\n\n“There it is, Ruth,” he said; “we are one heart and one soul. Could he\nlove, and not I? You cannot decide between us, for one is the other. If\nI had known you first, Jonathan would be now in my place. What follows,\nthen?”\n\n“No marriage,” she whispered.\n\n“No!” he answered; “we brothers must learn to be two men instead of one.\nYou will partly take my place with Jonathan; I must live with half my\nlife, unless I can find, somewhere in the world, your other half.”\n\n“I cannot part you, David!”\n\n“Something stronger than you or me parts us, Ruth. If it were death,\nwe should bow to God's will: well, it can no more be got away from than\ndeath or judgment. Say no more: the pattern of all this was drawn long\nbefore we were born, and we cannot do any thing but work it out.”\n\nHe rose and stood before her. “Remember this, Ruth,” he said; “it is no\nblame in us to love each other. Jonathan will see the truth in my face\nwhen we meet, and I speak for him also. You will not see me again until\nyour wedding-day, and then no more afterwards--but, yes! ONCE, in some\nfar-off time, when you shall know me to be David, and still give me the\nkiss you gave to-day.”\n\n“Ah, after death!” she thought: “I have parted them forever.” She was\nabout to rise, but fell upon the seat again, fainting. At the same\nmoment Jonathan appeared at David's side.\n\nNo word was said. They bore her forth and supported her between them\nuntil the fresh breeze had restored her to consciousness. Her first\nglance rested on the brother's hands, clasping; then, looking from one\nto the other, she saw that the cheeks of both were wet.\n\n“Now, leave me,” she said, “but come to-morrow, Jonathan!” Even then she\nturned from one to the other, with a painful, touching uncertainty, and\nstretched out both hands to them in farewell.\n\nHow that poor twin heart struggled with itself is only known to God. All\nhuman voices, and as they believed, also the Divine Voice, commanded the\ndivision of their interwoven life. Submission would have seemed easier,\ncould they have taken up equal and similar burdens; but David was\nunable to deny that his pack was overweighted. For the first time, their\nthoughts began to diverge.\n\nAt last David said: “For mother's sake, Jonathan, as we promised. She\nalways called you HER child. And for Ruth's sake, and father's last\nadvice: they all tell me what I must do.”\n\nIt was like the struggle between will and desire, in the same nature,\nand none the less fierce or prolonged because the softer quality foresaw\nits ultimate surrender. Long after he felt the step to be inevitable,\nJonathan sought to postpone it, but he was borne by all combined\ninfluences nearer and nearer to the time.\n\nAnd now the wedding-day came. David was to leave home the same evening,\nafter the family dinner under his father's roof. In the morning he said\nto Jonathan: “I shall not write until I feel that I have become other\nthan now, but I shall always be here, in you, as you will be in me,\neverywhere. Whenever you want me, I shall know it; and I think I shall\nknow when to return.”\n\nThe hearts of all the people went out towards them as they stood\ntogether in the little village church. Both were calm, but very pale and\nabstracted in their expression, yet their marvellous likeness was still\nunchanged. Ruth's eyes were cast down so they could not be seen; she\ntrembled visibly, and her voice was scarcely audible when she spoke the\nvow. It was only known in the neighborhood that David was going to make\nanother journey. The truth could hardly have been guessed by persons\nwhose ideas follow the narrow round of their own experiences; had it\nbeen, there would probably have been more condemnation than sympathy.\nBut in a vague way the presence of some deeper element was felt--the\nfalling of a shadow, although the outstretched wing was unseen. Far\nabove them, and above the shadow, watched the Infinite Pity, which was\nnot denied to three hearts that day.\n\nIt was a long time, more than a year, and Ruth was lulling her first\nchild on her bosom, before a letter came from David. He had wandered\nwestwards, purchased some lands on the outer line of settlement, and\nappeared to be leading a wild and lonely life. “I know now,” he wrote,\n“just how much there is to bear, and how to bear it. Strange men come\nbetween us, but you are not far off when I am alone on these plains.\nThere is a place where I can always meet you, and I know that you have\nfound it,--under the big ash-tree by the barn. I think I am nearly\nalways there about sundown, and on moonshiny nights, because we are then\nnearest together; and I never sleep without leaving you half my blanket.\nWhen I first begin to wake I always feel your breath, so we are never\nreally parted for long. I do not know that I can change much; it is not\neasy; it is like making up your mind to have different colored eyes\nand hair, and I can only get sunburnt and wear a full beard. But we are\nhardly as unhappy as we feared to be; mother came the other night, in a\ndream, and took us on her knees. Oh, come to me, Jonathan, but for one\nday! No, you will not find me; I am going across the Plains!”\n\nAnd Jonathan and Ruth? They loved each other tenderly; no external\ntrouble visited them; their home was peaceful and pure; and yet, every\nroom and stairway and chair was haunted by a sorrowful ghost. As a\nneighbor said after visiting them, “There seemed to be something lost.”\n Ruth saw how constantly and how unconsciously Jonathan turned to see\nhis own every feeling reflected in the missing eyes; how his hand sought\nanother, even while its fellow pressed hers; how half-spoken words,\nday and night, died upon his lips, because they could not reach the\ntwin-ear. She knew not how it came, but her own nature took upon itself\nthe same habit. She felt that she received a less measure of love than\nshe gave--not from Jonathan, in whose whole, warm, transparent heart no\nother woman had ever looked, but something of her own passed beyond him\nand never returned. To both their life was like one of those conjurer's\ncups, seemingly filled with red wine, which is held from the lips by the\nfalse crystal hollow.\n\nNeither spoke of this: neither dared to speak. The years dragged out\ntheir slow length, with rare and brief messages from David. Three\nchildren were in the house, and still peace and plenty laid their signs\nupon its lintels. But at last Ruth, who had been growing thinner and\npaler ever since the birth of her first boy, became seriously ill.\nConsumption was hers by inheritance, and it now manifested itself in a\nform which too surely foretold the result. After the physician had\ngone, leaving his fatal verdict behind him, she called to Jonathan,\nwho, bewildered by his grief, sank down on his knees at her bedside and\nsobbed upon her breast.\n\n“Don't grieve,” she said; “this is my share of the burden. If I have\ntaken too much from you and David, now comes the atonement. Many things\nhave grown clear to me. David was right when he said that there was no\nblame. But my time is even less than the doctor thinks: where is David?\nCan you not bid him come?”\n\n“I can only call him with my heart,” he answered. “And will he hear me\nnow, after nearly seven years?”\n\n“Call, then!” she eagerly cried. “Call with all the strength of your\nlove for him and for me, and I believe he will hear you!”\n\nThe sun was just setting. Jonathan went to the great ash-tree, behind\nthe barn, fell upon his knees, and covered his face, and the sense of\nan exceeding bitter cry filled his heart. All the suppressed and baffled\nlonging, the want, the hunger, the unremitting pain of years, came upon\nhim and were crowded into the single prayer, “Come, David, or I die!”\n Before the twilight faded, while he was still kneeling, an arm came upon\nhis shoulder, and the faint touch of another cheek upon his own. It was\nhardly for the space of a thought, but he knew the sign.\n\n“David will come!” he said to Ruth.\n\nFrom that day all was changed. The cloud of coming death which hung over\nthe house was transmuted into fleecy gold. All the lost life came back\nto Jonathan's face, all the unrestful sweetness of Ruth's brightened\ninto a serene beatitude. Months had passed since David had been heard\nfrom; they knew not how to reach him without many delays; yet neither\ndreamed of doubting his coming.\n\nTwo weeks passed, three, and there was neither word nor sign. Jonathan\nand Ruth thought, “He is near,” and one day a singular unrest fell upon\nthe former. Ruth saw it, but said nothing until night came, when she\nsent Jonathan from her bedside with the words, “Go and meet him?”\n\nAn hour afterwards she heard double steps on the stone walk in front of\nthe house. They came slowly to the door; it opened; she heard them along\nthe hall and ascending the stairs; then the chamber-lamp showed her the\ntwo faces, bright with a single, unutterable joy.\n\nOne brother paused at the foot of the bed; the other drew near and bent\nover her. She clasped her thin hands around his neck, kissed him fondly,\nand cried, “Dear, dear David!”\n\n“Dear Ruth,” he said, “I came as soon as I could. I was far away, among\nwild mountains, when I felt that Jonathan was calling me. I knew that I\nmust return, never to leave you more, and there was still a little work\nto finish. Now we shall all live again!”\n\n“Yes,” said Jonathan, coming to her other side, “try to live, Ruth!”\n\nHer voice came clear, strong, and full of authority. “I DO live, as\nnever before. I shall take all my life with me when I go to wait for one\nsoul, as I shall find it there! Our love unites, not divides, from this\nhour!”\n\nThe few weeks still left to her were a season of almost superhuman\npeace. She faded slowly and painlessly, taking the equal love of the\ntwin-hearts, and giving an equal tenderness and gratitude. Then first\nshe saw the mysterious need which united them, the fulness and joy\nwherewith each completed himself in the other. All the imperfect past\nwas enlightened, and the end, even that now so near, was very good.\n\nEvery afternoon they carried her down to a cushioned chair on the\nveranda, where she could enjoy the quiet of the sunny landscape, the\npresence of the brothers seated at her feet, and the sports of her\nchildren on the grass. Thus, one day, while David and Jonathan held her\nhands and waited for her to wake from a happy sleep, she went before\nthem, and, ere they guessed the truth, she was waiting for their one\nsoul in the undiscovered land.\n\nAnd Jonathan's children, now growing into manhood and girlhood, also\ncall David “father.” The marks left by their divided lives have long\nsince vanished from their faces; the middle-aged men, whose hairs are\nturning gray, still walk hand in hand, still sleep upon the same pillow,\nstill have their common wardrobe, as when they were boys. They talk of\n“our Ruth” with no sadness, for they believe that death will make them\none, when, at the same moment, he summons both. And we who know them, to\nwhom they have confided the touching mystery of their nature, believe so\ntoo.\n\n\n\n\nTHE EXPERIENCES OF THE A. C.\n\n\n“Bridgeport! Change cars for the Naugatuck Railroad!” shouted the\nconductor of the New York and Boston Express Train, on the evening of\nMay 27th, 1858. Indeed, he does it every night (Sundays excepted),\nfor that matter; but as this story refers especially to Mr. J. Edward\nJohnson, who was a passenger on that train, on the aforesaid evening,\nI make special mention of the fact. Mr. Johnson, carpet-bag in hand,\njumped upon the platform, entered the office, purchased a ticket for\nWaterbury, and was soon whirling in the Naugatuck train towards his\ndestination.\n\nOn reaching Waterbury, in the soft spring twilight, Mr. Johnson walked\nup and down in front of the station, curiously scanning the faces of the\nassembled crowd. Presently he noticed a gentleman who was performing\nthe same operation upon the faces of the alighting passengers. Throwing\nhimself directly in the way of the latter, the two exchanged a steady\ngaze.\n\n“Is your name Billings?” “Is your name Johnson?” were simultaneous\nquestions, followed by the simultaneous exclamations--“Ned!” “Enos!”\n\nThen there was a crushing grasp of hands, repeated after a pause,\nin testimony of ancient friendship, and Mr. Billings, returning to\npractical life, asked--\n\n“Is that all your baggage? Come, I have a buggy here: Eunice has heard\nthe whistle, and she'll be impatient to welcome you.”\n\nThe impatience of Eunice (Mrs. Billings, of course,) was not of long\nduration, for in five minutes thereafter she stood at the door of her\nhusband's chocolate-colored villa, receiving his friend.\n\nWhile these three persons are comfortably seated at the tea-table,\nenjoying their waffles, cold tongue, and canned peaches, and asking\nand answering questions helter-skelter in the delightful confusion of\nreunion after long separation, let us briefly inform the reader who and\nwhat they are.\n\nMr. Enos Billings, then, was part owner of a manufactory of metal\nbuttons, forty years old, of middling height, ordinarily quiet and\nrather shy, but with a large share of latent warmth and enthusiasm in\nhis nature. His hair was brown, slightly streaked with gray, his eyes\na soft, dark hazel, forehead square, eyebrows straight, nose of no very\nmarked character, and a mouth moderately full, with a tendency to\ntwitch a little at the corners. His voice was undertoned, but mellow and\nagreeable.\n\nMrs. Eunice Billings, of nearly equal age, was a good specimen of\nthe wide-awake New-England woman. Her face had a piquant smartness of\nexpression, which might have been refined into a sharp edge, but for her\nnatural hearty good-humor. Her head was smoothly formed, her face a full\noval, her hair and eyes blond and blue in a strong light, but brown and\nsteel-gray at other times, and her complexion of that ripe fairness into\nwhich a ruddier color will sometimes fade. Her form, neither plump nor\nsquare, had yet a firm, elastic compactness, and her slightest movement\nconveyed a certain impression of decision and self-reliance.\n\nAs for J. Edward Johnson, it is enough to say that he was a tall,\nthin gentleman of forty-five, with an aquiline nose, narrow face, and\nmilitary whiskers, which swooped upwards and met under his nose in a\nglossy black mustache. His complexion was dark, from the bronzing of\nfifteen summers in New Orleans. He was a member of a wholesale hardware\nfirm in that city, and had now revisited his native North for the\nfirst time since his departure. A year before, some letters relating\nto invoices of metal buttons signed, “Foster, Kirkup, & Co., per Enos\nBillings,” had accidentally revealed to him the whereabouts of the old\nfriend of his youth, with whom we now find him domiciled. The first\nthing he did, after attending to some necessary business matters in New\nYork, was to take the train for Waterbury.\n\n“Enos,” said he, as he stretched out his hand for the third cup of tea\n(which he had taken only for the purpose of prolonging the pleasant\ntable-chat), “I wonder which of us is most changed.”\n\n“You, of course,” said Mr. Billings, “with your brown face and big\nmustache. Your own brother wouldn't have known you if he had seen you\nlast, as I did, with smooth cheeks and hair of unmerciful length. Why,\nnot even your voice is the same!”\n\n“That is easily accounted for,” replied Mr. Johnson. “But in your case,\nEnos, I am puzzled to find where the difference lies. Your features seem\nto be but little changed, now that I can examine them at leisure; yet it\nis not the same face. But, really, I never looked at you for so long\na time, in those days. I beg pardon; you used to be so--so remarkably\nshy.”\n\nMr. Billings blushed slightly, and seemed at a loss what to answer.\n\nHis wife, however, burst into a merry laugh, exclaiming--\n\n“Oh, that was before the days of the A. C!”\n\nHe, catching the infection, laughed also; in fact Mr. Johnson laughed,\nbut without knowing why.\n\n“The 'A. C.'!” said Mr. Billings. “Bless me, Eunice! how long it is\nsince we have talked of that summer! I had almost forgotten that there\never was an A. C.”\n\n“Enos, COULD you ever forget Abel Mallory and the beer?--or that scene\nbetween Hollins and Shelldrake?--or” (here SHE blushed the least bit)\n“your own fit of candor?” And she laughed again, more heartily than\never.\n\n“What a precious lot of fools, to be sure!” exclaimed her husband.\n\nMr. Johnson, meanwhile, though enjoying the cheerful humor of his hosts,\nwas not a little puzzled with regard to its cause.\n\n“What is the A. C.?” he ventured to ask.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Billings looked at each other, and smiled without replying.\n\n“Really, Ned,” said the former, finally, “the answer to your question\ninvolves the whole story.”\n\n“Then why not tell him the whole story, Enos?” remarked his wife.\n\n“You know I've never told it yet, and it's rather a hard thing to do,\nseeing that I'm one of the heroes of the farce--for it wasn't even\ngenteel comedy, Ned,” said Mr. Billings. “However,” he continued,\n“absurd as the story may seem, it's the only key to the change in my\nlife, and I must run the risk of being laughed at.”\n\n“I'll help you through, Enos,” said his wife, encouragingly; “and\nbesides, my role in the farce was no better than yours. Let us\nresuscitate, for to-night only, the constitution of the A. C.”\n\n“Upon my word, a capital idea! But we shall have to initiate Ned.”\n\nMr. Johnson merrily agreeing, he was blindfolded and conducted into\nanother room. A heavy arm-chair, rolling on casters, struck his legs in\nthe rear, and he sank into it with lamb-like resignation.\n\n“Open your mouth!” was the command, given with mock solemnity.\n\nHe obeyed.\n\n“Now shut it!”\n\nAnd his lips closed upon a cigar, while at the same time the\nhandkerchief was whisked away from his eyes. He found himself in Mr.\nBilling's library.\n\n“Your nose betrays your taste, Mr. Johnson,” said the lady, “and I\nam not hard-hearted enough to deprive you of the indulgence. Here are\nmatches.”\n\n“Well,” said he, acting upon the hint, “if the remainder of the\nceremonies are equally agreeable, I should like to be a permanent member\nof your order.”\n\nBy this time Mr. and Mrs. Billings, having between them lighted the\nlamp, stirred up the coal in the grate, closed the doors, and taken\npossession of comfortable chairs, the latter proclaimed--\n\n“The Chapter (isn't that what you call it?) will now be held!”\n\n“Was it in '43 when you left home, Ned?” asked Mr. B.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, the A. C. culminated in '45. You remember something of the\nsociety of Norridgeport, the last winter you were there? Abel Mallory,\nfor instance?”\n\n“Let me think a moment,” said Mr. Johnson reflectively. “Really, it\nseems like looking back a hundred years. Mallory--wasn't that the\nsentimental young man, with wispy hair, a tallowy skin, and big, sweaty\nhands, who used to be spouting Carlyle on the 'reading evenings' at\nShelldrake's? Yes, to be sure; and there was Hollins, with his clerical\nface and infidel talk,--and Pauline Ringtop, who used to say, 'The\nBeautiful is the Good.' I can still hear her shrill voice, singing,\n'Would that _I_ were beautiful, would that _I_ were fair!'”\n\nThere was a hearty chorus of laughter at poor Miss Ringtop's expense.\nIt harmed no one, however; for the tar-weed was already thick over her\nCalifornian grave.\n\n“Oh, I see,” said Mr. Billings, “you still remember the absurdities of\nthose days. In fact, I think you partially saw through them then. But I\nwas younger, and far from being so clear-headed, and I looked upon those\nevenings at Shelldrake's as being equal, at least, to the symposia of\nPlato. Something in Mallory always repelled me. I detested the sight of\nhis thick nose, with the flaring nostrils, and his coarse, half-formed\nlips, of the bluish color of raw corned-beef. But I looked upon these\nfeelings as unreasonable prejudices, and strove to conquer them, seeing\nthe admiration which he received from others. He was an oracle on the\nsubject of 'Nature.' Having eaten nothing for two years, except\nGraham bread, vegetables without salt, and fruits, fresh or dried, he\nconsidered himself to have attained an antediluvian purity of health--or\nthat he would attain it, so soon as two pimples on his left temple\nshould have healed. These pimples he looked upon as the last feeble\nstand made by the pernicious juices left from the meat he had formerly\neaten and the coffee he had drunk. His theory was, that through a body\nso purged and purified none but true and natural impulses could find\naccess to the soul. Such, indeed, was the theory we all held. A Return\nto Nature was the near Millennium, the dawn of which we already beheld\nin the sky. To be sure there was a difference in our individual views\nas to how this should be achieved, but we were all agreed as to what the\nresult should be.\n\n“I can laugh over those days now, Ned; but they were really happy while\nthey lasted. We were the salt of the earth; we were lifted above those\ngrovelling instincts which we saw manifested in the lives of others.\nEach contributed his share of gas to inflate the painted balloon to\nwhich we all clung, in the expectation that it would presently soar\nwith us to the stars. But it only went up over the out-houses, dodged\nbackwards and forwards two or three times, and finally flopped down with\nus into a swamp.”\n\n“And that balloon was the A. C.?” suggested Mr. Johnson.\n\n“As President of this Chapter, I prohibit questions,” said Eunice. “And,\nEnos, don't send up your balloon until the proper time. Don't anticipate\nthe programme, or the performance will be spoiled.”\n\n“I had almost forgotten that Ned is so much in the dark,” her obedient\nhusband answered. “You can have but a slight notion,” he continued,\nturning to his friend, “of the extent to which this sentimental, or\ntranscendental, element in the little circle at Shelldrake's increased\nafter you left Norridgeport. We read the 'Dial,' and Emerson; we\nbelieved in Alcott as the 'purple Plato' of modern times; we took\npsychological works out of the library, and would listen for hours to\nHollins while he read Schelling or Fichte, and then go home with a\nmisty impression of having imbibed infinite wisdom. It was, perhaps,\na natural, though very eccentric rebound from the hard, practical,\nunimaginative New-England mind which surrounded us; yet I look back upon\nit with a kind of wonder. I was then, as you know, unformed mentally,\nand might have been so still, but for the experiences of the A. C.”\n\nMr. Johnson shifted his position, a little impatiently. Eunice looked at\nhim with laughing eyes, and shook her finger with a mock threat.\n\n“Shelldrake,” continued Mr. Billings, without noticing this by-play,\n“was a man of more pretence than real cultivation, as I afterwards\ndiscovered. He was in good circumstances, and always glad to receive us\nat his house, as this made him, virtually, the chief of our tribe,\nand the outlay for refreshments involved only the apples from his\nown orchard and water from his well. There was an entire absence of\nconventionality at our meetings, and this, compared with the somewhat\nstiff society of the village, was really an attraction. There was a\nmystic bond of union in our ideas: we discussed life, love, religion,\nand the future state, not only with the utmost candor, but with a warmth\nof feeling which, in many of us, was genuine. Even I (and you know how\npainfully shy and bashful I was) felt myself more at home there than in\nmy father's house; and if I didn't talk much, I had a pleasant feeling\nof being in harmony with those who did.\n\n“Well, 'twas in the early part of '45--I think in April,--when we were\nall gathered together, discussing, as usual, the possibility of leading\na life in accordance with Nature. Abel Mallory was there, and Hollins,\nand Miss Ringtop, and Faith Levis, with her knitting,--and also Eunice\nHazleton, a lady whom you have never seen, but you may take my wife at\nher representative--”\n\n“Stick to the programme, Enos,” interrupted Mrs. Billings.\n\n“Eunice Hazleton, then. I wish I could recollect some of the speeches\nmade on that occasion. Abel had but one pimple on his temple (there was\na purple spot where the other had been), and was estimating that in two\nor three months more he would be a true, unspoiled man. His complexion,\nnevertheless, was more clammy and whey-like than ever.\n\n“'Yes,' said he, 'I also am an Arcadian! This false dual existence which\nI have been leading will soon be merged in the unity of Nature. Our\nlives must conform to her sacred law. Why can't we strip off these\nhollow Shams,' (he made great use of that word,) 'and be our true\nselves, pure, perfect, and divine?'\n\n“Miss Ringtop heaved a sigh, and repeated a stanza from her favorite\npoet:\n\n        “'Ah, when wrecked are my desires\n            On the everlasting Never,\n         And my heart with all its fires\n            Out forever,\n         In the cradle of Creation\n         Finds the soul resuscitation!\n\n\n“Shelldrake, however, turning to his wife, said--\n\n“'Elviry, how many up-stairs rooms is there in that house down on the\nSound?'\n\n“'Four,--besides three small ones under the roof. Why, what made you\nthink of that, Jesse?' said she.\n\n“'I've got an idea, while Abel's been talking,' he answered. 'We've\ntaken a house for the summer, down the other side of Bridgeport, right\non the water, where there's good fishing and a fine view of the Sound.\nNow, there's room enough for all of us--at least all that can make it\nsuit to go. Abel, you and Enos, and Pauline and Eunice might fix matters\nso that we could all take the place in partnership, and pass the summer\ntogether, living a true and beautiful life in the bosom of Nature. There\nwe shall be perfectly free and untrammelled by the chains which still\nhang around us in Norridgeport. You know how often we have wanted to be\nset on some island in the Pacific Ocean, where we could build up a\ntrue society, right from the start. Now, here's a chance to try the\nexperiment for a few months, anyhow.'\n\n“Eunice clapped her hands (yes, you did!) and cried out--\n\n“'Splendid! Arcadian! I'll give up my school for the summer.'\n\n“Miss Ringtop gave her opinion in another quotation:\n\n        “'The rainbow  hues of the Ideal\n         Condense to gems, and form the Real!'\n\n\n“Abel Mallory, of course, did not need to have the proposal repeated. He\nwas ready for any thing which promised indulgence, and the indulgence of\nhis sentimental tastes. I will do the fellow the justice to say that\nhe was not a hypocrite. He firmly believed both in himself and his\nideas--especially the former. He pushed both hands through the long\nwisps of his drab-colored hair, and threw his head back until his wide\nnostrils resembled a double door to his brain.\n\n“'Oh Nature!' he said, 'you have found your lost children! We shall obey\nyour neglected laws! we shall hearken to your divine whispers I we\nshall bring you back from your ignominious exile, and place you on your\nancestral throne!'\n\n“'Let us do it!' was the general cry.\n\n“A sudden enthusiasm fired us, and we grasped each other's hands in the\nhearty impulse of the moment. My own private intention to make a summer\ntrip to the White Mountains had been relinquished the moment I heard\nEunice give in her adhesion. I may as well confess, at once, that I was\ndesperately in love, and afraid to speak to her.\n\n“By the time Mrs. Sheldrake brought in the apples and water we were\ndiscussing the plan as a settled thing. Hollins had an engagement to\ndeliver Temperance lectures in Ohio during the summer, but decided to\npostpone his departure until August, so that he might, at least, spend\ntwo months with us. Faith Levis couldn't go--at which, I think, we were\nall secretly glad. Some three or four others were in the same case, and\nthe company was finally arranged to consist of the Shelldrakes, Hollins,\nMallory, Eunice, Miss Ringtop, and myself. We did not give much thought,\neither to the preparations in advance, or to our mode of life when\nsettled there. We were to live near to Nature: that was the main thing.\n\n“'What shall we call the place?' asked Eunice.\n\n“'Arcadia!' said Abel Mallory, rolling up his large green eyes.\n\n“'Then,' said Hollins, 'let us constitute ourselves the Arcadian Club!'”\n\n“Aha!” interrupted Mr. Johnson, “I see! The A. C.!”\n\n“Yes, you can see the A. C. now,” said Mrs. Billings; “but to understand\nit fully, you should have had a share in those Arcadian experiences.”\n\n“I am all the more interested in hearing them described. Go on, Enos.”\n\n“The proposition was adopted. We called ourselves The Arcadian Club; but\nin order to avoid gossip, and the usual ridicule, to which we were all\nmore or less sensitive, in case our plan should become generally known,\nit was agreed that the initials only should be used. Besides, there was\nan agreeable air of mystery about it: we thought of Delphi, and Eleusis,\nand Samothrace: we should discover that Truth which the dim eyes of\nworldly men and women were unable to see, and the day of disclosure\nwould be the day of Triumph. In one sense we were truly Arcadians: no\nsuspicion of impropriety, I verily believe, entered any of our minds. In\nour aspirations after what we called a truer life there was no material\ntaint. We were fools, if you choose, but as far as possible from\nbeing sinners. Besides, the characters of Mr. and Mrs. Shelldrake, who\nnaturally became the heads of our proposed community were sufficient\nto preserve us from slander or suspicion, if even our designs had been\npublicly announced.\n\n“I won't bore you with an account of our preparations. In fact, there\nwas very little to be done. Mr. Shelldrake succeeded in hiring the\nhouse, with most of its furniture, so that but a few articles had to\nbe supplied. My trunk contained more books than boots, more blank paper\nthan linen.\n\n“'Two shirts will be enough,' said Abel: 'you can wash one of them any\nday, and dry it in the sun.'\n\n“The supplies consisted mostly of flour, potatoes, and sugar. There was\na vegetable-garden in good condition, Mr. Shelldrake said, which would\nbe our principal dependence.\n\n“'Besides, the clams!' I exclaimed unthinkingly.\n\n“'Oh, yes!' said Eunice, 'we can have chowder-parties: that will be\ndelightful!'\n\n“'Clams! chowder! oh, worse than flesh!' groaned Abel. 'Will you\nreverence Nature by outraging her first laws?'\n\n“I had made a great mistake, and felt very foolish. Eunice and I looked\nat each other, for the first time.”\n\n“Speak for yourself only, Enos,” gently interpolated his wife.\n\n“It was a lovely afternoon in the beginning of June when we first\napproached Arcadia. We had taken two double teams at Bridgeport, and\ndrove slowly forward to our destination, followed by a cart containing\nour trunks and a few household articles. It was a bright, balmy day:\nthe wheat-fields were rich and green, the clover showed faint streaks\nof ruby mist along slopes leaning southward, and the meadows were yellow\nwith buttercups. Now and then we caught glimpses of the Sound, and, far\nbeyond it, the dim Long Island shore. Every old white farmhouse, with\nits gray-walled garden, its clumps of lilacs, viburnums, and early\nroses, offered us a picture of pastoral simplicity and repose. We passed\nthem, one by one, in the happiest mood, enjoying the earth around us,\nthe sky above, and ourselves most of all.\n\n“The scenery, however, gradually became more rough and broken. Knobs\nof gray gneiss, crowned by mournful cedars, intrenched upon the arable\nland, and the dark-blue gleam of water appeared through the trees. Our\nroad, which had been approaching the Sound, now skirted the head of a\ndeep, irregular inlet, beyond which extended a beautiful promontory,\nthickly studded with cedars, and with scattering groups of elm, oak and\nmaple trees. Towards the end of the promontory stood a house, with white\nwalls shining against the blue line of the Sound.\n\n“'There is Arcadia, at last!' exclaimed Mr. Shelldrake.\n\n“A general outcry of delight greeted the announcement. And, indeed, the\nloveliness of the picture surpassed our most poetic anticipations. The\nlow sun was throwing exquisite lights across the point, painting the\nslopes of grass of golden green, and giving a pearly softness to the\ngray rocks. In the back-ground was drawn the far-off water-line, over\nwhich a few specks of sail glimmered against the sky. Miss Ringtop, who,\nwith Eunice, Mallory, and myself, occupied one carriage, expressed her\n'gushing' feelings in the usual manner:\n\n        “'Where the turf is softest, greenest,\n            Doth an angel thrust me on,--\n          Where the landscape lies serenest,\n            In the journey of the sun!'\n\n\n“'Don't, Pauline!' said Eunice; 'I never like to hear poetry flourished\nin the face of Nature. This landscape surpasses any poem in the world.\nLet us enjoy the best thing we have, rather than the next best.'\n\n\n“'Ah, yes!' sighed Miss Ringtop, ''tis true!\n\n        “'They sing to the ear; this sings to the eye!'\n\n\n“Thenceforward, to the house, all was childish joy and jubilee. All\nminor personal repugnances were smoothed over in the general exultation.\nEven Abel Mallory became agreeable; and Hollins, sitting beside Mrs.\nShelldrake on the back seat of the foremost carriage, shouted to us, in\nboyish lightness of heart.\n\n“Passing the head of the inlet, we left the country-road, and entered,\nthrough a gate in the tottering stone wall, on our summer domain. A\ntrack, open to the field on one side, led us past a clump of deciduous\ntrees, between pastures broken by cedared knolls of rock, down\nthe centre of the peninsula, to the house. It was quite an old\nframe-building, two stories high, with a gambrel roof and tall chimneys.\nTwo slim Lombardy poplars and a broad-leaved catalpa shaded the southern\nside, and a kitchen-garden, divided in the centre by a double row of\nuntrimmed currant-bushes, flanked it on the east. For flowers, there\nwere masses of blue flags and coarse tawny-red lilies, besides a huge\ntrumpet-vine which swung its pendent arms from one of the gables.\nIn front of the house a natural lawn of mingled turf and rock sloped\nsteeply down to the water, which was not more than two hundred yards\ndistant. To the west was another and broader inlet of the Sound, out of\nwhich our Arcadian promontory rose bluff and bold, crowned with a\nthick fringe of pines. It was really a lovely spot which Shelldrake had\nchosen--so secluded, while almost surrounded by the winged and moving\nlife of the Sound, so simple, so pastoral and home-like. No one doubted\nthe success of our experiment, for that evening at least.\n\n“Perkins Brown, Shelldrake's boy-of-all-work, awaited us at the door.\nHe had been sent on two or three days in advance, to take charge of the\nhouse, and seemed to have had enough of hermit-life, for he hailed\nus with a wild whoop, throwing his straw hat half-way up one of the\npoplars. Perkins was a boy of fifteen, the child of poor parents,\nwho were satisfied to get him off their hands, regardless as to what\nhumanitarian theories might be tested upon him. As the Arcadian Club\nrecognized no such thing as caste, he was always admitted to our\nmeetings, and understood just enough of our conversation to excite a\nsilly ambition in his slow mind. His animal nature was predominant, and\nthis led him to be deceitful. At that time, however, we all looked upon\nhim as a proper young Arcadian, and hoped that he would develop into a\nsecond Abel Mallory.\n\n“After our effects had been deposited on the stoop, and the carriages\nhad driven away, we proceeded to apportion the rooms, and take\npossession. On the first floor there were three rooms, two of which\nwould serve us as dining and drawing rooms, leaving the third for the\nShelldrakes. As neither Eunice and Miss Ringtop, nor Hollins and Abel\nshowed any disposition to room together, I quietly gave up to them the\nfour rooms in the second story, and installed myself in one of the attic\nchambers. Here I could hear the music of the rain close above my head,\nand through the little gable window, as I lay in bed, watch the colors\nof the morning gradually steal over the distant shores. The end was, we\nwere all satisfied.\n\n“'Now for our first meal in Arcadia!' was the next cry. Mrs. Shelldrake,\nlike a prudent housekeeper, marched off to the kitchen, where Perkins\nhad already kindled a fire. We looked in at the door, but thought it\nbest to allow her undisputed sway in such a narrow realm. Eunice was\nunpacking some loaves of bread and paper bags of crackers; and Miss\nRingtop, smiling through her ropy curls, as much as to say, 'You see,\n_I_ also can perform the coarser tasks of life!' occupied herself with\nplates and cups. We men, therefore, walked out to the garden, which we\nfound in a promising condition. The usual vegetables had been planted\nand were growing finely, for the season was yet scarcely warm enough\nfor the weeds to make much headway. Radishes, young onions, and lettuce\nformed our contribution to the table. The Shelldrakes, I should explain,\nhad not yet advanced to the antediluvian point, in diet: nor, indeed,\nhad either Eunice or myself. We acknowledged the fascination of tea, we\nsaw a very mitigated evil in milk and butter, and we were conscious of\nstifled longings after the abomination of meat. Only Mallory, Hollins,\nand Miss Ringtop had reached that loftiest round on the ladder of\nprogress where the material nature loosens the last fetter of the\nspiritual. They looked down upon us, and we meekly admitted their right\nto do so.\n\n“Our board, that evening, was really tempting. The absence of meat was\ncompensated to us by the crisp and racy onions, and I craved only a\nlittle salt, which had been interdicted, as a most pernicious substance.\nI sat at one corner of the table, beside Perkins Brown, who took an\nopportunity, while the others were engaged in conversation, to jog my\nelbow gently. As I turned towards him, he said nothing, but dropped his\neyes significantly. The little rascal had the lid of a blacking-box,\nfilled with salt, upon his knee, and was privately seasoning his onions\nand radishes.\n\nI blushed at the thought of my hypocrisy, but the onions were so much\nbetter that I couldn't help dipping into the lid with him.\n\n“'Oh,' said Eunice, 'we must send for some oil and vinegar! This lettuce\nis very nice.'\n\n“'Oil and vinegar?' exclaimed Abel.\n\n“'Why, yes,' said she, innocently: 'they are both vegetable substances.'\n\n“Abel at first looked rather foolish, but quickly recovering himself,\nsaid--\n\n“'All vegetable substances are not proper for food: you would not taste\nthe poison-oak, or sit under the upas-tree of Java.'\n\n“'Well, Abel,' Eunice rejoined, 'how are we to distinguish what is best\nfor us? How are we to know WHAT vegetables to choose, or what animal and\nmineral substances to avoid?'\n\n“'I will tell you,' he answered, with a lofty air. 'See here!' pointing\nto his temple, where the second pimple--either from the change of air,\nor because, in the excitement of the last few days, he had forgotten\nit--was actually healed. 'My blood is at last pure. The struggle between\nthe natural and the unnatural is over, and I am beyond the depraved\ninfluences of my former taste. My instincts are now, therefore, entirely\npure also. What is good for man to eat, that I shall have a natural\ndesire to eat: what is bad will be naturally repelled. How does the cow\ndistinguish between the wholesome and the poisonous herbs of the meadow?\nAnd is man less than a cow, that he cannot cultivate his instincts to\nan equal point? Let me walk through the woods and I can tell you every\nberry and root which God designed for food, though I know not its name,\nand have never seen it before. I shall make use of my time, during our\nsojourn here, to test, by my purified instinct, every substance, animal,\nmineral, and vegetable, upon which the human race subsists, and to\ncreate a catalogue of the True Food of Man!'\n\n“Abel was eloquent on this theme, and he silenced not only Eunice,\nbut the rest of us. Indeed, as we were all half infected with the same\ndelusions, it was not easy to answer his sophistries.\n\n“After supper was over, the prospect of cleaning the dishes and putting\nthings in order was not so agreeable; but Mrs. Shelldrake and Perkins\nundertook the work, and we did not think it necessary to interfere with\nthem. Half an hour afterwards, when the full moon had risen, we took\nour chairs upon the sloop, to enjoy the calm, silver night, the soft\nsea-air, and our summer's residence in anticipatory talk.\n\n“'My friends,' said Hollins (and HIS hobby, as you may remember, Ned,\nwas the organization of Society, rather than those reforms which apply\ndirectly to the Individual),--'my friends, I think we are sufficiently\nadvanced in progressive ideas to establish our little Arcadian community\nupon what I consider the true basis: not Law, nor Custom, but the\nuncorrupted impulses of our nature. What Abel said in regard to dietetic\nreform is true; but that alone will not regenerate the race. We must\nrise superior to those conventional ideas of Duty whereby Life is warped\nand crippled. Life must not be a prison, where each one must come and\ngo, work, eat, and sleep, as the jailer commands. Labor must not be\na necessity, but a spontaneous joy. 'Tis true, but little labor is\nrequired of us here: let us, therefore, have no set tasks, no fixed\nrules, but each one work, rest, eat, sleep, talk or be silent, as his\nown nature prompts.'\n\n“Perkins, sitting on the steps, gave a suppressed chuckle, which I think\nno one heard but myself. I was vexed with his levity, but, nevertheless,\ngave him a warning nudge with my toe, in payment for the surreptitious\nsalt.\n\n“'That's just the notion I had, when I first talked of our coming here,'\nsaid Shelldrake. 'Here we're alone and unhindered; and if the plan\nshouldn't happen to work well (I don't see why it shouldn't though),\nno harm will be done. I've had a deal of hard work in my life, and I've\nbeen badgered and bullied so much by your strait-laced professors,\nthat I'm glad to get away from the world for a spell, and talk and do\nrationally, without being laughed at.'\n\n“'Yes,' answered Hollins, 'and if we succeed, as I feel we shall, for I\nthink I know the hearts of all of us here, this may be the commencement\nof a new Epoch for the world. We may become the turning-point between\ntwo dispensations: behind us every thing false and unnatural, before us\nevery thing true, beautiful, and good.'\n\n“'Ah,' sighed Miss Ringtop, 'it reminds me of Gamaliel J. Gawthrop's\nbeautiful lines:\n\n        “'Unrobed man is lying hoary\n            In the distance, gray and dead;\n         There no wreaths of godless glory\n            To his mist-like tresses wed,\n         And the foot-fall of the Ages\n            Reigns supreme, with noiseless tread.'\n\n\n“'I am willing to try the experiment,' said I, on being appealed to by\nHollins; 'but don't you think we had better observe some kind of order,\neven in yielding every thing to impulse? Shouldn't there be, at least, a\nplatform, as the politicians call it--an agreement by which we shall\nall be bound, and which we can afterwards exhibit as the basis of our\nsuccess?'\n\n“He meditated a few moments, and then answered--\n\n“'I think not. It resembles too much the thing we are trying to\noverthrow. Can you bind a man's belief by making him sign certain\narticles of Faith? No: his thought will be free, in spite of it; and I\nwould have Action--Life--as free as Thought. Our platform--to adopt your\nimage--has but one plank: Truth. Let each only be true to himself: BE\nhimself, ACT himself, or herself with the uttermost candor. We can all\nagree upon that.'\n\n“The agreement was accordingly made. And certainly no happier or more\nhopeful human beings went to bed in all New England that night.\n\n“I arose with the sun, went into the garden, and commenced weeding,\nintending to do my quota of work before breakfast, and then devote the\nday to reading and conversation. I was presently joined by Shelldrake\nand Mallory, and between us we finished the onions and radishes, stuck\nthe peas, and cleaned the alleys. Perkins, after milking the cow and\nturning her out to pasture, assisted Mrs. Shelldrake in the kitchen.\nAt breakfast we were joined by Hollins, who made no excuse for his\neasy morning habits; nor was one expected. I may as well tell you now,\nthough, that his natural instincts never led him to work. After a week,\nwhen a second crop of weeds was coming on, Mallory fell off also, and\nthenceforth Shelldrake and myself had the entire charge of the garden.\nPerkins did the rougher work, and was always on hand when he was wanted.\nVery soon, however, I noticed that he was in the habit of disappearing\nfor two or three hours in the afternoon.\n\n“Our meals preserved the same Spartan simplicity. Eunice, however,\ncarried her point in regard to the salad; for Abel, after tasting and\nfinding it very palatable, decided that oil and vinegar might be classed\nin the catalogue of True Food. Indeed, his long abstinence from piquant\nflavors gave him such an appetite for it that our supply of lettuce was\nsoon exhausted. An embarrassing accident also favored us with the use of\nsalt. Perkins happening to move his knee at the moment I was dipping an\nonion into the blacking-box lid, our supply was knocked upon the floor.\nHe picked it up, and we both hoped the accident might pass unnoticed.\nBut Abel, stretching his long neck across the corner of the table,\ncaught a glimpse of what was going on.\n\n“'What's that?' he asked.\n\n“'Oh, it's--it's only,' said I, seeking for a synonyme, 'only chloride\nof sodium!'\n\n“'Chloride of sodium! what do you do with it?'\n\n“'Eat it with onions,' said I, boldly: 'it's a chemical substance, but I\nbelieve it is found in some plants.'\n\n“Eunice, who knew something of chemistry (she taught a class, though you\nwouldn't think it), grew red with suppressed fun, but the others were as\nignorant as Abel Mallory himself.\n\n“'Let me taste it,' said he, stretching out an onion.\n\n“I handed him the box-lid, which still contained a portion of its\ncontents. He dipped the onion, bit off a piece, and chewed it gravely.\n\n“'Why,' said he, turning to me, 'it's very much like salt.'\n\n“Perkins burst into a spluttering yell, which discharged an onion-top he\nhad just put between his teeth across the table; Eunice and I gave way\nat the same moment; and the others, catching the joke, joined us. But\nwhile we were laughing, Abel was finishing his onion, and the result was\nthat Salt was added to the True Food, and thereafter appeared regularly\non the table.\n\n“The forenoons we usually spent in reading and writing, each in his or\nher chamber. (Oh, the journals, Ned!--but you shall not see mine.)\nAfter a midday meal,--I cannot call it dinner,--we sat upon the stoop,\nlistening while one of us read aloud, or strolled down the shores on\neither side, or, when the sun was not too warm, got into a boat, and\nrowed or floated lazily around the promontory.\n\n“One afternoon, as I was sauntering off, past the garden, towards the\neastern inlet, I noticed Perkins slipping along behind the cedar knobs,\ntowards the little woodland at the end of our domain. Curious to find\nout the cause of his mysterious disappearances, I followed cautiously.\nFrom the edge of the wood I saw him enter a little gap between the\nrocks, which led down to the water. Presently a thread of blue smoke\nstole up. Quietly creeping along, I got upon the nearer bluff and looked\ndown. There was a sort of hearth built up at the base of the rock, with\na brisk little fire burning upon it, but Perkins had disappeared. I\nstretched myself out upon the moss, in the shade, and waited. In about\nhalf an hour up came Perkins, with a large fish in one hand and a\nlump of clay in the other. I now understood the mystery. He carefully\nimbedded the fish in a thin layer of clay, placed it on the coals, and\nthen went down to the shore to wash his hands. On his return he found me\nwatching the fire.\n\n“'Ho, ho, Mr. Enos!' said he, 'you've found me out; But you won't say\nnothin'. Gosh! you like it as well I do. Look 'ee there!'--breaking open\nthe clay, from which arose 'a steam of rich distilled perfumes,'--'and,\nI say, I've got the box-lid with that 'ere stuff in it,--ho! ho!'--and\nthe scamp roared again.\n\n“Out of a hole in the rock he brought salt and the end of a loaf, and\nbetween us we finished the fish. Before long, I got into the habit of\ndisappearing in the afternoon.\n\n“Now and then we took walks, alone or collectively, to the nearest\nvillage, or even to Bridgeport, for the papers or a late book. The few\npurchases we required were made at such times, and sent down in a cart,\nor, if not too heavy, carried by Perkins in a basket. I noticed that\nAbel, whenever we had occasion to visit a grocery, would go sniffing\naround, alternately attracted or repelled by the various articles: now\nturning away with a shudder from a ham,--now inhaling, with a fearful\ndelight and uncertainty, the odor of smoked herrings. 'I think herrings\nmust feed on sea-weed,' said he, 'there is such a vegetable attraction\nabout them.' After his violent vegetarian harangues, however, he\nhesitated about adding them to his catalogue.\n\n“But, one day, as we were passing through the village, he was reminded\nby the sign of 'WARTER CRACKERS' in the window of an obscure grocery\nthat he required a supply of these articles, and we therefore entered.\nThere was a splendid Rhode Island cheese on the counter, from which the\nshop-mistress was just cutting a slice for a customer. Abel leaned over\nit, inhaling the rich, pungent fragrance.\n\n“'Enos,' said he to me, between his sniffs, 'this impresses me like\nflowers--like marigolds. It must be--really--yes, the vegetable element\nis predominant. My instinct towards it is so strong that I cannot be\nmistaken. May I taste it, ma'am?'\n\n“The woman sliced off a thin corner, and presented it to him on the\nknife.\n\n“'Delicious!' he exclaimed; 'I am right,--this is the True Food. Give me\ntwo pounds--and the crackers, ma'am.'\n\n“I turned away, quite as much disgusted as amused with\nthis charlatanism. And yet I verily believe the fellow was\nsincere--self-deluded only. I had by this time lost my faith in him,\nthough not in the great Arcadian principles. On reaching home, after\nan hour's walk, I found our household in unusual commotion. Abel was\nwrithing in intense pain: he had eaten the whole two pounds of cheese,\non his way home! His stomach, so weakened by years of unhealthy\nabstinence from true nourishment, was now terribly tortured by this\nsudden stimulus. Mrs. Shelldrake, fortunately, had some mustard among\nher stores, and could therefore administer a timely emetic. His life was\nsaved, but he was very ill for two or three days. Hollins did not fail\nto take advantage of this circumstance to overthrow the authority which\nAbel had gradually acquired on the subject of food. He was so arrogant\nin his nature that he could not tolerate the same quality in another,\neven where their views coincided.\n\n“By this time several weeks had passed away. It was the beginning of\nJuly, and the long summer heats had come. I was driven out of my attic\nduring the middle hours of the day, and the others found it pleasanter\non the doubly shaded stoop than in their chambers. We were thus thrown\nmore together than usual--a circumstance which made our life more\nmonotonous to the others, as I could see; but to myself, who could at\nlast talk to Eunice, and who was happy at the very sight of her, this\n'heated term' seemed borrowed from Elysium.\n\n“I read aloud, and the sound of my own voice gave me confidence; many\npassages suggested discussions, in which I took a part; and you may\njudge, Ned, how fast I got on, from the fact that I ventured to tell\nEunice of my fish-bakes with Perkins, and invite her to join them. After\nthat, she also often disappeared from sight for an hour or two in the\nafternoon.”\n\n----“Oh, Mr. Johnson,” interrupted Mrs. Billings, “it wasn't for the\nfish!”\n\n“Of course not,” said her husband; “it was for my sake.”\n\n“No, you need not think it was for you. Enos,” she added, perceiving the\nfeminine dilemma into which she had been led, “all this is not necessary\nto the story.”\n\n“Stop!” he answered. “The A. C. has been revived for this night only.\nDo you remember our platform, or rather no-platform? I must follow my\nimpulses, and say whatever comes uppermost.”\n\n“Right, Enos,” said Mr. Johnson; “I, as temporary Arcadian, take the\nsame ground. My instinct tells me that you, Mrs. Billings, must permit\nthe confession.”\n\nShe submitted with a good grace, and her husband continued:\n\n“I said that our lazy life during the hot weather had become a little\nmonotonous. The Arcadian plan had worked tolerably well, on the whole,\nfor there was very little for any one to do--Mrs. Shelldrake and Perkins\nBrown excepted. Our conversation, however, lacked spirit and variety. We\nwere, perhaps unconsciously, a little tired of hearing and assenting to\nthe same sentiments. But one evening, about this time, Hollins struck\nupon a variation, the consequences of which he little foresaw. We\nhad been reading one of Bulwer's works (the weather was too hot for\nPsychology), and came upon this paragraph, or something like it:\n\n“'Ah, Behind the Veil! We see the summer smile of the Earth--enamelled\nmeadow and limpid stream,--but what hides she in her sunless heart?\nCaverns of serpents, or grottoes of priceless gems? Youth, whose soul\nsits on thy countenance, thyself wearing no mask, strive not to lift the\nmasks of others! Be content with what thou seest; and wait until Time\nand Experience shall teach thee to find jealousy behind the sweet smile,\nand hatred under the honeyed word!'\n\n“This seemed to us a dark and bitter reflection; but one or another of\nus recalled some illustration of human hypocrisy, and the evidences,\nby the simple fact of repetition, gradually led to a division of\nopinion--Hollins, Shelldrake, and Miss Ringtop on the dark side, and\nthe rest of us on the bright. The last, however, contented herself with\nquoting from her favorite poet, Gamaliel J. Gawthrop:\n\n        “'I look beyond thy brow's concealment!\n         I see thy spirit's dark revealment!\n         Thy inner self betrayed I see:\n         Thy coward, craven, shivering ME!'\n\n\n“'We think we know one another,' exclaimed Hollins; 'but do we? We see\nthe faults of others, their weaknesses, their disagreeable qualities,\nand we keep silent. How much we should gain, were candor as universal\nas concealment! Then each one, seeing himself as others see him, would\ntruly know himself. How much misunderstanding might be avoided--how\nmuch hidden shame be removed--hopeless, because unspoken, love made\nglad--honest admiration cheer its object--uttered sympathy mitigate\nmisfortune--in short, how much brighter and happier the world would\nbecome if each one expressed, everywhere and at all times, his true and\nentire feeling! Why, even Evil would lose half its power!'\n\n“There seemed to be so much practical wisdom in these views that we were\nall dazzled and half-convinced at the start. So, when Hollins, turning\ntowards me, as he continued, exclaimed--'Come, why should not this\ncandor be adopted in our Arcadia? Will any one--will you, Enos--commence\nat once by telling me now--to my face--my principal faults?' I answered\nafter a moment's reflection--'You have a great deal of intellectual\narrogance, and you are, physically, very indolent'\n\n“He did not flinch from the self-invited test, though he looked a little\nsurprised.\n\n“'Well put,' said he, 'though I do not say that you are entirely\ncorrect. Now, what are my merits?'\n\n“'You are clear-sighted,' I answered, 'an earnest seeker after truth,\nand courageous in the avowal of your thoughts.'\n\n“This restored the balance, and we soon began to confess our own private\nfaults and weaknesses. Though the confessions did not go very deep,--no\none betraying anything we did not all know already,--yet they were\nsufficient to strength Hollins in his new idea, and it was unanimously\nresolved that Candor should thenceforth be the main charm of our\nArcadian life. It was the very thing _I_ wanted, in order to make\na certain communication to Eunice; but I should probably never have\nreached the point, had not the same candor been exercised towards me,\nfrom a quarter where I least expected it.\n\n“The next day, Abel, who had resumed his researches after the True Food,\ncame home to supper with a healthier color than I had before seen on his\nface.\n\n“'Do you know,' said he, looking shyly at Hollins, 'that I begin to\nthink Beer must be a natural beverage? There was an auction in the\nvillage to-day, as I passed through, and I stopped at a cake-stand to\nget a glass of water, as it was very hot. There was no water--only beer:\nso I thought I would try a glass, simply as an experiment. Really, the\nflavor was very agreeable. And it occurred to me, on the way home, that\nall the elements contained in beer are vegetable. Besides, fermentation\nis a natural process. I think the question has never been properly\ntested before.'\n\n“'But the alcohol!' exclaimed Hollins.\n\n“'I could not distinguish any, either by taste or smell. I know that\nchemical analysis is said to show it; but may not the alcohol be\ncreated, somehow, during the analysis?'\n\n“'Abel,' said Hollins, in a fresh burst of candor, 'you will never be\na Reformer, until you possess some of the commonest elements of\nknowledge.'\n\n“The rest of us were much diverted: it was a pleasant relief to our\nmonotonous amiability.\n\n“Abel, however, had a stubborn streak in his character. The next day he\nsent Perkins Brown to Bridgeport for a dozen bottles of 'Beer.' Perkins,\neither intentionally or by mistake, (I always suspected the former,)\nbrought pint-bottles of Scotch ale, which he placed in the coolest part\nof the cellar. The evening happened to be exceedingly hot and sultry,\nand, as we were all fanning ourselves and talking languidly, Abel\nbethought him of his beer. In his thirst, he drank the contents of the\nfirst bottle, almost at a single draught.\n\n“'The effect of beer,' said he, 'depends, I think, on the commixture of\nthe nourishing principle of the grain with the cooling properties of the\nwater. Perhaps, hereafter, a liquid food of the same character may be\ninvented, which shall save us from mastication and all the diseases of\nthe teeth.'\n\n“Hollins and Shelldrake, at his invitation, divided a bottle between\nthem, and he took a second. The potent beverage was not long in acting\non a brain so unaccustomed to its influence. He grew unusually talkative\nand sentimental, in a few minutes.\n\n“'Oh, sing, somebody!' he sighed in a hoarse rapture: 'the night was\nmade for Song.'\n\n“Miss Ringtop, nothing loath, immediately commenced, 'When stars are in\nthe quiet skies;' but scarcely had she finished the first verse before\nAbel interrupted her.\n\n“'Candor's the order of the day, isn't it?' he asked.\n\n“'Yes!' 'Yes!' two or three answered.\n\n“'Well then,' said he, 'candidly, Pauline, you've got the darn'dest\nsqueaky voice'--\n\n“Miss Ringtop gave a faint little scream of horror.\n\n“'Oh, never mind!' he continued. 'We act according to impulse, don't we?\nAnd I've the impulse to swear; and it's right. Let Nature have her\nway. Listen! Damn, damn, damn, damn! I never knew it was so easy. Why,\nthere's a pleasure in it! Try it, Pauline! try it on me!'\n\n“'Oh-ooh!' was all Miss Ringtop could utter.\n\n“'Abel! Abel!' exclaimed Hollins, 'the beer has got into your head.'\n\n“'No, it isn't Beer,--it's Candor!' said Abel. 'It's your own proposal,\nHollins. Suppose it's evil to swear: isn't it better I should express\nit, and be done with it, than keep it bottled up to ferment in my mind?\nOh, you're a precious, consistent old humbug, you are!'\n\n“And therewith he jumped off the stoop, and went dancing awkwardly\ndown towards the water, singing in a most unmelodious voice, ''Tis home\nwhere'er the heart is.'\n\n“'Oh, he may fall into the water!' exclaimed Eunice, in alarm.\n\n“'He's not fool enough to do that,' said Shelldrake. 'His head is a\nlittle light, that's all. The air will cool him down presently.'\n\n“But she arose and followed him, not satisfied with this assurance. Miss\nRingtop sat rigidly still. She would have received with composure the\nnews of his drowning.\n\n“As Eunice's white dress disappeared among the cedars crowning\nthe shore, I sprang up and ran after her. I knew that Abel was not\nintoxicated, but simply excited, and I had no fear on his account: I\nobeyed an involuntary impulse. On approaching the water, I heard their\nvoices--hers in friendly persuasion, his in sentimental entreaty,--then\nthe sound of oars in the row-locks. Looking out from the last clump of\ncedars, I saw them seated in the boat, Eunice at the stern, while Abel,\nfacing her, just dipped an oar now and then to keep from drifting with\nthe tide. She had found him already in the boat, which was loosely\nchained to a stone. Stepping on one of the forward thwarts in her\neagerness to persuade him to return, he sprang past her, jerked away the\nchain, and pushed off before she could escape. She would have fallen,\nbut he caught her and placed her in the stern, and then seated himself\nat the oars. She must have been somewhat alarmed, but there was only\nindignation in her voice. All this had transpired before my arrival, and\nthe first words I heard bound me to the spot and kept me silent.\n\n“'Abel, what does this mean?' she asked\n\n“'It means Fate--Destiny!' he exclaimed, rather wildly. 'Ah, Eunice, ask\nthe night, and the moon,--ask the impulse which told you to follow me!\nLet us be candid like the old Arcadians we imitate. Eunice, we know that\nwe love each other: why should we conceal it any longer? The Angel of\nLove comes down from the stars on his azure wings, and whispers to our\nhearts. Let us confess to each other! The female heart should not be\ntimid, in this pure and beautiful atmosphere of Love which we breathe.\nCome, Eunice! we are alone: let your heart speak to me!'\n\n“Ned, if you've ever been in love, (we'll talk of that after a while,)\nyou will easily understand what tortures I endured, in thus hearing\nhim speak. That HE should love Eunice! It was a profanation to her, an\noutrage to me. Yet the assurance with which he spoke! COULD she love\nthis conceited, ridiculous, repulsive fellow, after all? I almost gasped\nfor breath, as I clinched the prickly boughs of the cedars in my hands,\nand set my teeth, waiting to hear her answer.\n\n“'I will not hear such language! Take me back to the shore!' she said,\nin very short, decided tones.\n\n“'Oh, Eunice,' he groaned, (and now, I think he was perfectly sober,)\n'don't you love me, indeed? _I_ love you,--from my heart I do: yes, I\nlove you. Tell me how you feel towards me.'\n\n“'Abel,' said she, earnestly, 'I feel towards you only as a friend;\nand if you wish me to retain a friendly interest in you, you must never\nagain talk in this manner. I do not love you, and I never shall. Let me\ngo back to the house.'\n\n“His head dropped upon his breast, but he rowed back to the shore, drew\nthe bow upon the rocks, and assisted her to land. Then, sitting down, he\ngroaned forth--\n\n“'Oh, Eunice, you have broken my heart!' and putting his big hands to\nhis face, began to cry.\n\n“She turned, placed one hand on his shoulder, and said in a calm, but\nkind tone--\n\n“'I am very sorry, Abel, but I cannot help it.'\n\n“I slipped aside, that she might not see me, and we returned by separate\npaths.\n\n“I slept very little that night. The conviction which I chased away from\nmy mind as often as it returned, that our Arcadian experiment was taking\na ridiculous and at the same time impracticable development, became\nclearer and stronger. I felt sure that our little community could not\nhold together much longer without an explosion. I had a presentiment\nthat Eunice shared my impressions. My feelings towards her had reached\nthat crisis where a declaration was imperative: but how to make it? It\nwas a terrible struggle between my shyness and my affection. There was\nanother circumstance in connection with this subject, which troubled me\nnot a little. Miss Ringtop evidently sought my company, and made me, as\nmuch as possible, the recipient of her sentimental outpourings. I was\nnot bold enough to repel her--indeed I had none of that tact which is\nso useful in such emergencies,--and she seemed to misinterpret my\nsubmission. Not only was her conversation pointedly directed to me, but\nshe looked at me, when singing, (especially, 'Thou, thou, reign'st in\nthis bosom!') in a way that made me feel very uncomfortable. What\nif Eunice should suspect an attachment towards her, on my part. What\nif--oh, horror!--I had unconsciously said or done something to impress\nMiss Ringtop herself with the same conviction? I shuddered as the\nthought crossed my mind. One thing was very certain: this suspense was\nnot to be endured much longer.\n\n“We had an unusually silent breakfast the next morning. Abel scarcely\nspoke, which the others attributed to a natural feeling of shame, after\nhis display of the previous evening. Hollins and Shelldrake discussed\nTemperance, with a special view to his edification, and Miss Ringtop\nfavored us with several quotations about 'the maddening bowl,'--but\nhe paid no attention to them. Eunice was pale and thoughtful. I had\nno doubt in my mind, that she was already contemplating a removal from\nArcadia. Perkins, whose perceptive faculties were by no means dull,\nwhispered to me, 'Shan't I bring up some porgies for supper?' but I\nshook my head. I was busy with other thoughts, and did not join him in\nthe wood, that day.\n\n“The forenoon was overcast, with frequent showers. Each one occupied his\nor her room until dinner-time, when we met again with something of the\nold geniality. There was an evident effort to restore our former flow of\ngood feeling. Abel's experience with the beer was freely discussed. He\ninsisted strongly that he had not been laboring under its effects, and\nproposed a mutual test. He, Shelldrake, and Hollins were to drink it\nin equal measures, and compare observations as to their physical\nsensations. The others agreed,--quite willingly, I thought,--but I\nrefused. I had determined to make a desperate attempt at candor, and\nAbel's fate was fresh before my eyes.\n\n“My nervous agitation increased during the day, and after sunset,\nfearing lest I should betray my excitement in some way, I walked down\nto the end of the promontory, and took a seat on the rocks. The sky\nhad cleared, and the air was deliciously cool and sweet. The Sound was\nspread out before me like a sea, for the Long Island shore was veiled in\na silvery mist. My mind was soothed and calmed by the influences of the\nscene, until the moon arose. Moonlight, you know, disturbs--at least,\nwhen one is in love. (Ah, Ned, I see you understand it!) I felt\nblissfully miserable, ready to cry with joy at the knowledge that I\nloved, and with fear and vexation at my cowardice, at the same time.\n\n“Suddenly I heard a rustling beside me. Every nerve in my body tingled,\nand I turned my head, with a beating and expectant heart. Pshaw! It was\nMiss Ringtop, who spread her blue dress on the rock beside me, and shook\nback her long curls, and sighed, as she gazed at the silver path of the\nmoon on the water.\n\n“'Oh, how delicious!' she cried. 'How it seems to set the spirit free,\nand we wander off on the wings of Fancy to other spheres!'\n\n“'Yes,' said I, 'It is very beautiful, but sad, when one is alone.'\n\n“I was thinking of Eunice.\n\n“'How inadequate,' she continued, 'is language to express the emotions\nwhich such a scene calls up in the bosom! Poetry alone is the voice of\nthe spiritual world, and we, who are not poets, must borrow the language\nof the gifted sons of Song. Oh, Enos, I WISH you were a poet! But you\nFEEL poetry, I know you do. I have seen it in your eyes, when I quoted\nthe burning lines of Adeliza Kelley, or the soul-breathings of Gamaliel\nJ. Gawthrop. In HIM, particularly, I find the voice of my own nature.\nDo you know his 'Night-Whispers?' How it embodies the feelings of such a\nscene as this!\n\n        “Star-drooping bowers bending down the spaces,\n         And moonlit glories sweep star-footed on;\n         And pale, sweet rivers, in their shining races,\n         Are ever gliding through the moonlit places,\n         With silver ripples on their tranced faces,\n    And forests clasp their dusky hands, with low and sullen moan!'\n\n\n“'Ah!' she continued, as I made no reply, 'this is an hour for the soul\nto unveil its most secret chambers! Do you not think, Enos, that love\nrises superior to all conventionalities? that those whose souls are in\nunison should be allowed to reveal themselves to each other, regardless\nof the world's opinions?'\n\n“'Yes!' said I, earnestly.\n\n“'Enos, do you understand me?' she asked, in a tender voice--almost a\nwhisper.\n\n“'Yes,' said I, with a blushing confidence of my own passion.\n\n“'Then,' she whispered, 'our hearts are wholly in unison. I know you are\ntrue, Enos. I know your noble nature, and I will never doubt you. This\nis indeed happiness!'\n\n“And therewith she laid her head on my shoulder, and sighed--\n\n        “'Life remits his tortures cruel,\n         Love illumes his fairest fuel,\n         When the hearts that once were dual\n         Meet as one, in sweet renewal!'\n\n\n“'Miss Ringtop!' I cried, starting away from her, in alarm, 'you don't\nmean that--that--'\n\n“I could not finish the sentence.\n\n“'Yes, Enos, DEAR Enos! henceforth we belong to each other.'\n\n“The painful embarrassment I felt, as her true meaning shot through my\nmind, surpassed anything I had imagined, or experienced in anticipation,\nwhen planning how I should declare myself to Eunice. Miss Ringtop was\nat least ten years older than I, far from handsome (but you remember her\nface,) and so affectedly sentimental, that I, sentimental as I was then,\nwas sick of hearing her talk. Her hallucination was so monstrous, and\ngave me such a shock of desperate alarm, that I spoke, on the impulse of\nthe moment, with great energy, without regarding how her feelings might\nbe wounded.\n\n“'You mistake!' I exclaimed. 'I didn't mean that,--I didn't understand\nyou. Don't talk to me that way,--don't look at me in that way, Miss\nRingtop! We were never meant for each other--I wasn't----You're so much\nolder--I mean different. It can't be--no, it can never be! Let us go\nback to the house: the night is cold.'\n\n“I rose hastily to my feet. She murmured something,--what, I did not\nstay to hear,--but, plunging through the cedars, was hurrying with all\nspeed to the house, when, half-way up the lawn, beside one of the rocky\nknobs, I met Eunice, who was apparently on her way to join us.\n\n“In my excited mood, after the ordeal through which I had passed,\neverything seemed easy. My usual timidity was blown to the four winds. I\nwent directly to her, took her hand, and said--\n\n“'Eunice, the others are driving me mad with their candor; will you let\nme be candid, too?'\n\n“'I think you are always candid, Enos,' she answered.\n\n“Even then, if I had hesitated, I should have been lost. But I went on,\nwithout pausing--\n\n“'Eunice, I love you--I have loved you since we first met. I came here\nthat I might be near you; but I must leave you forever, and to-night,\nunless you can trust your life in my keeping. God help me, since we have\nbeen together I have lost my faith in almost everything but you.\nPardon me, if I am impetuous--different from what I have seemed. I have\nstruggled so hard to speak! I have been a coward, Eunice, because of my\nlove. But now I have spoken, from my heart of hearts. Look at me: I can\nbear it now. Read the truth in my eyes, before you answer.'\n\n“I felt her hand tremble while I spoke. As she turned towards me her\nface, which had been averted, the moon shone full upon it, and I saw\nthat tears were upon her cheeks. What was said--whether anything was\nsaid--I cannot tell. I felt the blessed fact, and that was enough. That\nwas the dawning of the true Arcadia.”\n\nMrs. Billings, who had been silent during this recital, took her\nhusband's hand and smiled. Mr. Johnson felt a dull pang about the region\nof his heart. If he had a secret, however, I do not feel justified in\nbetraying it.\n\n“It was late,” Mr. Billings continued, “before we returned to the house.\nI had a special dread of again encountering Miss Ringtop, but she was\nwandering up and down the bluff, under the pines, singing, 'The dream\nis past.' There was a sound of loud voices, as we approached the stoop.\nHollins, Shelldrake and his wife, and Abel Mallory were sitting together\nnear the door. Perkins Brown, as usual, was crouched on the lowest step,\nwith one leg over the other, and rubbing the top of his boot with a\nvigor which betrayed to me some secret mirth. He looked up at me from\nunder his straw hat with the grin of a malicious Puck, glanced towards\nthe group, and made a curious gesture with his thumb. There were several\nempty pint-bottles on the stoop.\n\n“'Now, are you sure you can bear the test?' we heard Hollins ask, as we\napproached.\n\n“'Bear it? Why to be sure!' replied Shelldrake; 'if I couldn't bear it,\nor if YOU couldn't, your theory's done for. Try! I can stand it as long\nas you can.'\n\n“'Well, then,' said Hollins, 'I think you are a very ordinary man. I\nderive no intellectual benefit from my intercourse with you, but\nyour house is convenient to me. I'm under no obligations for your\nhospitality, however, because my company is an advantage to you. Indeed\nif I were treated according to my deserts, you couldn't do enough for\nme.'\n\n“Mrs. Shelldrake was up in arms.\n\n“'Indeed,' she exclaimed, 'I think you get as good as you deserve, and\nmore too.'\n\n“'Elvira,' said he, with a benevolent condescension, 'I have no doubt\nyou think so, for your mind belongs to the lowest and most material\nsphere. You have your place in Nature, and you fill it; but it is not\nfor you to judge of intelligences which move only on the upper planes.'\n\n“'Hollins,' said Shelldrake, 'Elviry's a good wife and a sensible woman,\nand I won't allow you to turn up your nose at her.'\n\n“'I am not surprised,' he answered, 'that you should fail to stand the\ntest. I didn't expect it.'\n\n“'Let me try it on YOU!' cried Shelldrake. 'You, now, have some\nintellect,--I don't deny that,--but not so much, by a long shot, as you\nthink you have. Besides that, you're awfully selfish in your opinions.\nYou won't admit that anybody can be right who differs from you. You've\nsponged on me for a long time; but I suppose I've learned something from\nyou, so we'll call it even. I think, however, that what you call acting\naccording to impulse is simply an excuse to cover your own laziness.'\n\n“'Gosh! that's it!' interrupted Perkins, jumping up; then, recollecting\nhimself, he sank down on the steps again, and shook with a suppressed\n'Ho! ho! ho!'\n\n“Hollins, however, drew himself up with an exasperated air.\n\n“'Shelldrake,' said he, 'I pity you. I always knew your ignorance, but\nI thought you honest in your human character. I never suspected you\nof envy and malice. However, the true Reformer must expect to be\nmisunderstood and misrepresented by meaner minds. That love which I bear\nto all creatures teaches me to forgive you. Without such love, all plans\nof progress must fail. Is it not so, Abel?'\n\n“Shelldrake could only ejaculate the words, 'Pity!' 'Forgive?' in his\nmost contemptuous tone; while Mrs. Shelldrake, rocking violently in\nher chair, gave utterance to that peculiar clucking, 'TS, TS, TS, TS,'\nwhereby certain women express emotions too deep for words.\n\n“Abel, roused by Hollins's question, answered, with a sudden energy--\n\n“'Love! there is no love in the world. Where will you find it? Tell me,\nand I'll go there. Love! I'd like to see it! If all human hearts were\nlike mine, we might have an Arcadia; but most men have no hearts. The\nworld is a miserable, hollow, deceitful shell of vanity and hypocrisy.\nNo: let us give up. We were born before our time: this age is not worthy\nof us.'\n\n“Hollins stared at the speaker in utter amazement. Shelldrake gave a\nlong whistle, and finally gasped out--\n\n“'Well, what next?'\n\n“None of us were prepared for such a sudden and complete wreck of our\nArcadian scheme. The foundations had been sapped before, it is true; but\nwe had not perceived it; and now, in two short days, the whole edifice\ntumbled about our ears. Though it was inevitable, we felt a shock of\nsorrow, and a silence fell upon us. Only that scamp of a Perkins Brown,\nchuckling and rubbing his boot, really rejoiced. I could have kicked\nhim.\n\n“We all went to bed, feeling that the charm of our Arcadian life was\nover. I was so full of the new happiness of love that I was scarcely\nconscious of regret. I seemed to have leaped at once into responsible\nmanhood, and a glad rush of courage filled me at the knowledge that\nmy own heart was a better oracle than those--now so shamefully\noverthrown--on whom I had so long implicitly relied. In the first\nrevulsion of feeling, I was perhaps unjust to my associates. I see\nnow, more clearly, the causes of those vagaries, which originated in a\ngenuine aspiration, and failed from an ignorance of the true nature\nof Man, quite as much as from the egotism of the individuals. Other\nattempts at reorganizing Society were made about the same time by men of\nculture and experience, but in the A. C. we had neither. Our leaders had\ncaught a few half-truths, which, in their minds, were speedily warped\ninto errors. I can laugh over the absurdities I helped to perpetrate,\nbut I must confess that the experiences of those few weeks went far\ntowards making a man of me.”\n\n“Did the A. C. break up at once?” asked Mr. Johnson.\n\n“Not precisely; though Eunice and I left the house within two days,\nas we had agreed. We were not married immediately, however. Three long\nyears--years of hope and mutual encouragement--passed away before that\nhappy consummation. Before our departure, Hollins had fallen into his\nold manner, convinced, apparently, that Candor must be postponed to a\nbetter age of the world. But the quarrel rankled in Shelldrake's mind,\nand especially in that of his wife. I could see by her looks and little\nfidgety ways that his further stay would be very uncomfortable. Abel\nMallory, finding himself gaining in weight and improving in color, had\nno thought of returning. The day previous, as I afterwards learned, he\nhad discovered Perkins Brown's secret kitchen in the woods.\n\n“'Golly!' said that youth, in describing the circumstance to me, 'I had\nto ketch TWO porgies that day.'\n\n“Miss Ringtop, who must have suspected the new relation between Eunice\nand myself, was for the most part rigidly silent. If she quoted, it was\nfrom the darkest and dreariest utterances of her favorite Gamaliel.\n\n“What happened after our departure I learned from Perkins, on the\nreturn of the Shelldrakes to Norridgeport, in September. Mrs. Shelldrake\nstoutly persisted in refusing to make Hollins's bed, or to wash his\nshirts. Her brain was dull, to be sure; but she was therefore all the\nmore stubborn in her resentment. He bore this state of things for about\na week, when his engagements to lecture in Ohio suddenly called him\naway. Abel and Miss Ringtop were left to wander about the promontory in\ncompany, and to exchange lamentations on the hollowness of human hopes\nor the pleasures of despair. Whether it was owing to that attraction of\nsex which would make any man and any woman, thrown together on a desert\nisland, finally become mates, or whether she skilfully ministered to\nAbel's sentimental vanity, I will not undertake to decide: but the fact\nis, they were actually betrothed, on leaving Arcadia. I think he would\nwillingly have retreated, after his return to the world; but that was\nnot so easy. Miss Ringtop held him with an inexorable clutch. They were\nnot married, however, until just before his departure for California,\nwhither she afterwards followed him. She died in less than a year, and\nleft him free.”\n\n“And what became of the other Arcadians?” asked Mr. Johnson.\n\n“The Shelldrakes are still living in Norridgeport. They have become\nSpiritualists, I understand, and cultivate Mediums. Hollins, when I\nlast heard of him, was a Deputy-Surveyor in the New York Custom-House.\nPerkins Brown is our butcher here in Waterbury, and he often asks\nme--'Do you take chloride of soda on your beefsteaks?' He is as fat as a\nprize ox, and the father of five children.”\n\n“Enos!” exclaimed Mrs. Billings, looking at the clock, “it's nearly\nmidnight! Mr. Johnson must be very tired, after such a long story.\n\n“The Chapter of the A. C. is hereby closed!”\n\n\n\n\nFRIEND ELI'S DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nThe mild May afternoon was drawing to a close, as Friend Eli Mitchenor\nreached the top of the long hill, and halted a few minutes, to allow his\nhorse time to recover breath. He also heaved a sigh of satisfaction,\nas he saw again the green, undulating valley of the Neshaminy, with its\ndazzling squares of young wheat, its brown patches of corn-land, its\nsnowy masses of blooming orchard, and the huge, fountain like jets\nof weeping willow, half concealing the gray stone fronts of the\nfarm-houses. He had been absent from home only six days, but the time\nseemed almost as long to him as a three years' cruise to a New Bedford\nwhaleman. The peaceful seclusion and pastoral beauty of the scene did\nnot consciously appeal to his senses; but he quietly noted how much the\nwheat had grown during his absence, that the oats were up and looking\nwell, that Friend Comly's meadow had been ploughed, and Friend Martin\nhad built his half of the line-fence along the top of the hill-field.\nIf any smothered delight in the loveliness of the spring-time found\na hiding-place anywhere in the well-ordered chambers of his heart, it\nnever relaxed or softened the straight, inflexible lines of his face. As\neasily could his collarless drab coat and waistcoat have flushed with a\nsudden gleam of purple or crimson.\n\nEli Mitchenor was at peace with himself and the world--that is, so much\nof the world as he acknowledged. Beyond the community of his own sect,\nand a few personal friends who were privileged to live on its borders,\nhe neither knew nor cared to know much more of the human race than if\nit belonged to a planet farther from the sun. In the discipline of the\nFriends he was perfect; he was privileged to sit on the high seats,\nwith the elders of the Society; and the travelling brethren from other\nStates, who visited Bucks County, invariably blessed his house with\na family-meeting. His farm was one of the best on the banks of the\nNeshaminy, and he also enjoyed the annual interest of a few thousand\ndollars, carefully secured by mortgages on real estate. His wife,\nAbigail, kept even pace with him in the consideration she enjoyed\nwithin the limits of the sect; and his two children, Moses and Asenath,\nvindicated the paternal training by the strictest sobriety of dress and\nconduct. Moses wore the plain coat, even when his ways led him among\n“the world's people;” and Asenath had never been known to wear, or\nto express a desire for, a ribbon of a brighter tint than brown or\nfawn-color. Friend Mitchenor had thus gradually ripened to his sixtieth\nyear in an atmosphere of life utterly placid and serene, and looked\nforward with confidence to the final change, as a translation into a\ndeeper calm, a serener quiet, a prosperous eternity of mild voices,\nsubdued colors, and suppressed emotions.\n\nHe was returning home, in his own old-fashioned “chair,” with its heavy\nsquare canopy and huge curved springs, from the Yearly Meeting of the\nHicksite Friends, in Philadelphia. The large bay farm-horse, slow and\ngrave in his demeanor, wore his plain harness with an air which made him\nseem, among his fellow-horses, the counterpart of his master among\nmen. He would no more have thought of kicking than the latter would of\nswearing a huge oath. Even now, when the top of the hill was gained, and\nhe knew that he was within a mile of the stable which had been his\nhome since colthood, he showed no undue haste or impatience, but waited\nquietly, until Friend Mitchenor, by a well-known jerk of the lines,\ngave him the signal to go on. Obedient to the motion, he thereupon\nset forward once more, jogging soberly down the eastern slope of the\nhill,--across the covered bridge, where, in spite of the tempting level\nof the hollow-sounding floor, he was as careful to abstain from trotting\nas if he had read the warning notice,--along the wooded edge of the\ngreen meadow, where several cows of his acquaintance were grazing,--and\nfinally, wheeling around at the proper angle, halted squarely in front\nof the gate which gave entrance to the private lane.\n\nThe old stone house in front, the spring-house in a green little hollow\njust below it, the walled garden, with its clumps of box and lilac, and\nthe vast barn on the left, all joining in expressing a silent welcome to\ntheir owner, as he drove up the lane. Moses, a man of twenty-five, left\nhis work in the garden, and walked forward in his shirt-sleeves.\n\n“Well, father, how does thee do?” was his quiet greeting, as they shook\nhands.\n\n“How's mother, by this time?” asked Eli.\n\n“Oh, thee needn't have been concerned,” said the son. “There she is. Go\nin: I'll tend to the horse.”\n\nAbigail and her daughter appeared on the piazza. The mother was a woman\nof fifty, thin and delicate in frame, but with a smooth, placid beauty\nof countenance which had survived her youth. She was dressed in a\nsimple dove-colored gown, with book-muslin cap and handkerchief, so\nscrupulously arranged that one might have associated with her for six\nmonths without ever discovering a spot on the former, or an uneven fold\nin the latter. Asenath, who followed, was almost as plainly attired,\nher dress being a dark-blue calico, while a white pasteboard sun-bonnet,\nwith broad cape, covered her head.\n\n“Well, Abigail, how art thou?” said Eli, quietly giving his hand to his\nwife.\n\n“I'm glad to see thee back,” was her simple welcome.\n\nNo doubt they had kissed each other as lovers, but Asenath had witnessed\nthis manifestation of affection but once in her life--after the burial\nof a younger sister. The fact impressed her with a peculiar sense of\nsanctity and solemnity: it was a caress wrung forth by a season of\ntribulation, and therefore was too earnest to be profaned to the uses\nof joy. So far, therefore, from expecting a paternal embrace, she would\nhave felt, had it been given, like the doomed daughter of the Gileadite,\nconsecrated to sacrifice.\n\nBoth she and her mother were anxious to hear the proceedings of the\nmeeting, and to receive personal news of the many friends whom Eli had\nseen; but they asked few questions until the supper-table was ready and\nMoses had come in from the barn. The old man enjoyed talking, but it\nmust be in his own way and at his own good time. They must wait until\nthe communicative spirit should move him. With the first cup of coffee\nthe inspiration came. Hovering at first over indifferent details, he\ngradually approached those of more importance,--told of the addresses\nwhich had been made, the points of discipline discussed, the testimony\nborne, and the appearance and genealogy of any new Friends who had taken\na prominent part therein. Finally, at the close of his relation, he\nsaid--\n\n“Abigail, there is one thing I must talk to thee about. Friend\nSpeakman's partner,--perhaps thee's heard of him, Richard Hilton,--has\na son who is weakly. He's two or three years younger than Moses. His\nmother was consumptive, and they're afraid he takes after her. His\nfather wants to send him into the country for the summer--to some place\nwhere he'll have good air, and quiet, and moderate exercise, and Friend\nSpeakman spoke of us. I thought I'd mention it to thee, and if thee\nthinks well of it, we can send word down next week, when Josiah Comly\ngoes”\n\n“What does THEE think?” asked his wife, after a pause\n\n“He's a very quiet, steady young man, Friend Speakman says, and would be\nvery little trouble to thee. I thought perhaps his board would buy the\nnew yoke of oxen we must have in the fall, and the price of the fat ones\nmight go to help set up Moses. But it's for thee to decide.”\n\n“I suppose we could take him,” said Abigail, seeing that the decision\nwas virtually made already; “there's the corner room, which we don't\noften use. Only, if he should get worse on our hands--”\n\n“Friend Speakman says there's no danger. He is only weak-breasted, as\nyet, and clerking isn't good for him. I saw the young man at the store.\nIf his looks don't belie him, he's well-behaved and orderly.”\n\nSo it was settled that Richard Hilton the younger was to be an inmate of\nFriend Mitchenor's house during the summer.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nAt the end of ten days he came.\n\nIn the under-sized, earnest, dark-haired and dark-eyed young man of\nthree-and-twenty, Abigail Mitchenor at once felt a motherly interest.\nHaving received him as a temporary member of the family, she considered\nhim entitled to the same watchful care as if he were in reality an\ninvalid son. The ice over an hereditary Quaker nature is but a thin\ncrust, if one knows how to break it; and in Richard Hilton's case, it\nwas already broken before his arrival. His only embarrassment, in fact,\narose from the difficulty which he naturally experienced in adapting\nhimself to the speech and address of the Mitchenor family. The greetings\nof old Eli, grave, yet kindly, of Abigail, quaintly familiar and tender,\nof Moses, cordial and slightly condescending, and finally of Asenath,\nsimple and natural to a degree which impressed him like a new revelation\nin woman, at once indicated to him his position among them. His city\nmanners, he felt, instinctively, must be unlearned, or at least laid\naside for a time. Yet it was not easy for him to assume, at such short\nnotice, those of his hosts. Happening to address Asenath as “Miss\nMitchenor,” Eli turned to him with a rebuking face.\n\n“We do not use compliments, Richard,” said he; “my daughter's name is\nAsenath.\n\n“I beg pardon. I will try to accustom myself to your ways, since you\nhave been so kind as to take me for a while,” apologized Richard Hilton.\n\n“Thee's under no obligation to us,” said Friend Mitchenor, in his strict\nsense of justice; “thee pays for what thee gets.”\n\nThe finer feminine instinct of Abigail led her to interpose.\n\n“We'll not expect too much of thee, at first, Richard,” she remarked,\nwith a kind expression of face, which had the effect of a smile: “but\nour ways are plain and easily learned. Thee knows, perhaps, that we're\nno respecters of persons.”\n\nIt was some days, however, before the young man could overcome his\nnatural hesitation at the familiarity implied by these new forms of\nspeech. “Friend Mitchenor” and “Moses” were not difficult to learn,\nbut it seemed a want of respect to address as “Abigail” a woman of such\nsweet and serene dignity as the mother, and he was fain to avoid either\nextreme by calling her, with her cheerful permission, “Aunt Mitchenor.”\n On the other hand, his own modest and unobtrusive nature soon won the\nconfidence and cordial regard of the family. He occasionally busied\nhimself in the garden, by way of exercise, or accompanied Moses to\nthe corn-field or the woodland on the hill, but was careful never to\ninterfere at inopportune times, and willing to learn silently, by the\nsimple process of looking on.\n\nOne afternoon, as he was idly sitting on the stone wall which\nseparated the garden from the lane, Asenath, attired in a new gown of\nchocolate-colored calico, with a double-handled willow work-basket on\nher arm, issued from the house. As she approached him, she paused and\nsaid--\n\n“The time seems to hang heavy on thy hands, Richard. If thee's strong\nenough to walk to the village and back, it might do thee more good than\nsitting still.”\n\nRichard Hilton at once jumped down from the wall.\n\n“Certainly I am able to go,” said he, “if you will allow it.”\n\n“Haven't I asked thee?” was her quiet reply.\n\n“Let me carry your basket,” he said, suddenly, after they had walked,\nside by side, some distance down the lane.\n\n“Indeed, I shall not let thee do that. I'm only going for the mail,\nand some little things at the store, that make no weight at all. Thee\nmustn't think I'm like the young women in the city, who, I'm told, if\nthey buy a spool of Cotton, must have it sent home to them. Besides,\nthee mustn't over-exert thy strength.”\n\nRichard Hilton laughed merrily at the gravity with which she uttered the\nlast sentence.\n\n“Why, Miss--Asenath, I mean--what am I good for; if I have not strength\nenough to carry a basket?”\n\n“Thee's a man, I know, and I think a man would almost as lief be thought\nwicked as weak. Thee can't help being weakly-inclined, and it's only\nright that thee should be careful of thyself. There's surely nothing in\nthat that thee need be ashamed of.”\n\nWhile thus speaking, Asenath moderated her walk, in order, unconsciously\nto her companion, to restrain his steps.\n\n“Oh, there are the dog's-tooth violets in blossom?” she exclaimed,\npointing to a shady spot beside the brook; “does thee know them?”\n\nRichard immediately gathered and brought to her a handful of the nodding\nyellow bells, trembling above their large, cool, spotted leaves.\n\n“How beautiful they are!” said he; “but I should never have taken them\nfor violets.”\n\n“They are misnamed,” she answered. “The flower is an Erythronium; but\nI am accustomed to the common name, and like it. Did thee ever study\nbotany?”\n\n“Not at all. I can tell a geranium, when I see it, and I know a\nheliotrope by the smell. I could never mistake a red cabbage for a\nrose, and I can recognize a hollyhock or a sunflower at a considerable\ndistance. The wild flowers are all strangers to me; I wish I knew\nsomething about them.”\n\n“If thee's fond of flowers, it would be very easy to learn. I think a\nstudy of this kind would pleasantly occupy thy mind. Why couldn't thee\ntry? I would be very willing to teach thee what little I know. It's not\nmuch, indeed, but all thee wants is a start. See, I will show thee how\nsimple the principles are.”\n\nTaking one of the flowers from the bunch, Asenath, as they slowly walked\nforward, proceeded to dissect it, explained the mysteries of stamens and\npistils, pollen, petals, and calyx, and, by the time they had reached\nthe village, had succeeded in giving him a general idea of the Linnaean\nsystem of classification. His mind took hold of the subject with a\nprompt and profound interest. It was a new and wonderful world which\nsuddenly opened before him. How surprised he was to learn that there\nwere signs by which a poisonous herb could be detected from a wholesome\none, that cedars and pine-trees blossomed, that the gray lichens on\nthe rocks belonged to the vegetable kingdom! His respect for Asenath's\nknowledge thrust quite out of sight the restraint which her youth and\nsex had imposed upon him. She was teacher, equal, friend; and the simple\ncandid manner which was the natural expression of her dignity and purity\nthoroughly harmonized with this relation.\n\nAlthough, in reality, two or three years younger than he, Asenath had\na gravity of demeanor, a calm self-possession, a deliberate balance of\nmind, and a repose of the emotional nature, which he had never before\nobserved, except in much older women. She had had, as he could well\nimagine, no romping girlhood, no season of careless, light-hearted\ndalliance with opening life, no violent alternation even of the usual\ngriefs and joys of youth. The social calm in which she had expanded had\ndeveloped her nature as gently and securely as a sea-flower is unfolded\nbelow the reach of tides and storms.\n\nShe would have been very much surprised if any one had called her\nhandsome: yet her face had a mild, unobtrusive beauty which seemed\nto grow and deepen from day to day. Of a longer oval than the Greek\nstandard, it was yet as harmonious in outline; the nose was fine and\nstraight, the dark-blue eyes steady and untroubled, and the lips calmly,\nbut not too firmly closed. Her brown hair, parted over a high white\nforehead, was smoothly laid across the temples, drawn behind the ears,\nand twisted into a simple knot. The white cape and sun-bonnet gave her\nface a nun-like character, which set her apart, in the thoughts of “the\nworld's people” whom she met, as one sanctified for some holy work. She\nmight have gone around the world, repelling every rude word, every bold\nglance, by the protecting atmosphere of purity and truth which inclosed\nher.\n\nThe days went by, each bringing some new blossom to adorn and illustrate\nthe joint studies of the young man and maiden. For Richard Hilton\nhad soon mastered the elements of botany, as taught by Priscilla\nWakefield,--the only source of Asenath's knowledge,--and entered,\nwith her, upon the text-book of Gray, a copy of which he procured from\nPhiladelphia. Yet, though he had overtaken her in his knowledge of the\ntechnicalities of the science, her practical acquaintance with plants\nand their habits left her still his superior. Day by day, exploring the\nmeadows, the woods, and the clearings, he brought home his discoveries\nto enjoy her aid in classifying and assigning them to their true places.\nAsenath had generally an hour or two of leisure from domestic duties\nin the afternoons, or after the early supper of summer was over; and\nsometimes, on “Seventh-days,” she would be his guide to some locality\nwhere the rarer plants were known to exist. The parents saw this\ncommunity of interest and exploration without a thought of misgiving.\nThey trusted their daughter as themselves; or, if any possible fear had\nflitted across their hearts, it was allayed by the absorbing delight\nwith which Richard Hilton pursued his study. An earnest discussion as to\nwhether a certain leaf was ovate or lanceolate, whether a certain plant\nbelonged to the species scandens or canadensis, was, in their eyes,\nconvincing proof that the young brains were touched, and therefore NOT\nthe young hearts.\n\nBut love, symbolized by a rose-bud, is emphatically a botanical emotion.\nA sweet, tender perception of beauty, such as this study requires, or\ndevelops, is at once the most subtile and certain chain of communication\nbetween impressible natures. Richard Hilton, feeling that his years were\nnumbered, had given up, in despair, his boyish dreams, even before he\nunderstood them: his fate seemed to preclude the possibility of love.\nBut, as he gained a little strength from the genial season, the pure\ncountry air, and the release from gloomy thoughts which his rambles\nafforded, the end was farther removed, and a future--though brief,\nperhaps, still a FUTURE--began to glimmer before him. If this could\nbe his life,--an endless summer, with a search for new plants every\nmorning, and their classification every evening, with Asenath's help\non the shady portico of Friend Mitchenor's house,--he could forget his\ndoom, and enjoy the blessing of life unthinkingly.\n\nThe azaleas succeeded to the anemones, the orchis and trillium followed,\nthen the yellow gerardias and the feathery purple pogonias, and finally\nthe growing gleam of the golden-rods along the wood-side and the red\numbels of the tall eupatoriums in the meadow announced the close of\nsummer. One evening, as Richard, in displaying his collection, brought\nto view the blood-red leaf of a gum-tree, Asenath exclaimed--\n\n“Ah, there is the sign! It is early, this year.”\n\n“What sign?” he asked.\n\n“That the summer is over. We shall soon have frosty nights, and\nthen nothing will be left for us except the asters and gentians and\ngolden-rods.”\n\nWas the time indeed so near? A few more weeks, and this Arcadian life\nwould close. He must go back to the city, to its rectilinear streets,\nits close brick walls, its artificial, constrained existence. How could\nhe give up the peace, the contentment, the hope he had enjoyed through\nthe summer? The question suddenly took a more definite form in his mind:\nHow could he give up Asenath? Yes--the quiet, unsuspecting girl, sitting\nbeside him, with her lap full of the September blooms he had gathered,\nwas thenceforth a part of his inmost life. Pure and beautiful as she\nwas, almost sacred in his regard, his heart dared to say--“I need her\nand claim her!”\n\n“Thee looks pale to-night, Richard,” said Abigail, as they took their\nseats at the supper-table. “I hope thee has not taken cold.”\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n“Will thee go along, Richard? I know where the rudbeckias grow,” said\nAsenath, on the following “Seventh-day” afternoon.\n\nThey crossed the meadows, and followed the course of the stream, under\nits canopy of magnificent ash and plane trees, into a brake between\nthe hills. It was an almost impenetrable thicket, spangled with tall\nautumnal flowers. The eupatoriums, with their purple crowns, stood like\nyoung trees, with an undergrowth of aster and blue spikes of lobelia,\ntangled in a golden mesh of dodder. A strong, mature odor, mixed alike\nof leaves and flowers, and very different from the faint, elusive\nsweetness of spring, filled the air. The creek, with a few faded leaves\ndropped upon its bosom, and films of gossamer streaming from its bushy\nfringe, gurgled over the pebbles in its bed. Here and there, on its\nbanks, shone the deep yellow stars of the flower they sought.\n\nRichard Hilton walked as in a dream, mechanically plucking a stem of\nrudbeckia, only to toss it, presently, into the water.\n\n“Why, Richard! what's thee doing?” cried Asenath; “thee has thrown away\nthe very best specimen.”\n\n“Let it go,” he answered, sadly. “I am afraid everything else is thrown\naway.”\n\n“What does thee mean?” she asked, with a look of surprised and anxious\ninquiry.\n\n“Don't ask me, Asenath. Or--yes, I WILL tell you. I must say it to\nyou now, or never afterwards. Do you know what a happy life I've been\nleading since I came here?--that I've learned what life is, as if I'd\nnever known it before? I want to live, Asenath,--and do you know why?”\n\n“I hope thee will live, Richard,” she said, gently and tenderly, her\ndeep-blue eyes dim with the mist of unshed tears.\n\n“But, Asenath, how am I to live without you? But you can't understand\nthat, because you do not know what you are to me. No, you never guessed\nthat all this while I've been loving you more and more, until now I\nhave no other idea of death than not to see you, not to love you, not to\nshare your life!”\n\n“Oh, Richard!”\n\n“I knew you would be shocked, Asenath. I meant to have kept this to\nmyself. You never dreamed of it, and I had no right to disturb the peace\nof your heart. The truth is told now,--and I cannot take it back, if\nI wished. But if you cannot love, you can forgive me for loving\nyou--forgive me now and every day of my life.”\n\nHe uttered these words with a passionate tenderness, standing on\nthe edge of the stream, and gazing into its waters. His slight frame\ntrembled with the violence of his emotion. Asenath, who had become very\npale as he commenced to speak, gradually flushed over neck and brow\nas she listened. Her head drooped, the gathered flowers fell from her\nhands, and she hid her face. For a few minutes no sound was heard but\nthe liquid gurgling of the water, and the whistle of a bird in the\nthicket beside them. Richard Hilton at last turned, and, in a voice of\nhesitating entreaty, pronounced her name--\n\n“Asenath!”\n\nShe took away her hands, and slowly lifted her face. She was pale,\nbut her eyes met his with a frank, appealing, tender expression, which\ncaused his heart to stand still a moment. He read no reproach, no\nfaintest thought of blame; but--was it pity?--was it pardon?--or----\n\n“We stand before God, Richard,” said she, in a low, sweet, solemn tone.\n“He knows that I do not need to forgive thee. If thee requires it, I\nalso require His forgiveness for myself.”\n\nThough a deeper blush now came to cheek and brow, she met his gaze with\nthe bravery of a pure and innocent heart. Richard, stunned with the\nsudden and unexpected bliss, strove to take the full consciousness of\nit into a being which seemed too narrow to contain it. His first impulse\nwas to rush forward, clasp her passionately in his arms, and hold her in\nthe embrace which encircled, for him, the boundless promise of life; but\nshe stood there, defenceless, save in her holy truth and trust, and his\nheart bowed down and gave her reverence.\n\n“Asenath,” said he, at last, “I never dared to hope for this. God bless\nyou for those words! Can you trust me?--can you indeed love me?”\n\n“I can trust thee,--I DO love thee!”\n\nThey clasped each other's hands in one long, clinging pressure. No kiss\nwas given, but side by side they walked slowly up the dewy meadows, in\nhappy and hallowed silence. Asenath's face became troubled as the old\nfarmhouse appeared through the trees.\n\n“Father and mother must know of this, Richard,” said she. “I am afraid\nit may be a cross to them.”\n\nThe same fear had already visited his own mind, but he answered,\ncheerfully--\n\n“I hope not. I think I have taken a new lease of life, and shall soon\nbe strong enough to satisfy them. Besides, my father is in prosperous\nbusiness.”\n\n“It is not that,” she answered; “but thee is not one of us.”\n\nIt was growing dusk when they reached the house. In the dim candle-light\nAsenath's paleness was not remarked; and Richard's silence was\nattributed to fatigue.\n\nThe next morning the whole family attended meeting at the neighboring\nQuaker meeting-house, in the preparation for which, and the various\nspecial occupations of their “First-day” mornings, the unsuspecting\nparents overlooked that inevitable change in the faces of the lovers\nwhich they must otherwise have observed. After dinner, as Eli was taking\na quiet walk in the garden, Richard Hilton approached him.\n\n“Friend Mitchenor,” said he, “I should like to have some talk with\nthee.”\n\n“What is it, Richard?” asked the old man, breaking off some pods from a\nseedling radish, and rubbing them in the palm of his hand.\n\n“I hope, Friend Mitchenor,” said the young man, scarcely knowing how\nto approach so important a crisis in his life, “I hope thee has been\nsatisfied with my conduct since I came to live with thee, and has no\nfault to find with me as a man.”\n\n“Well,” exclaimed Eli, turning around and looking up, sharply, “does\nthee want a testimony from me? I've nothing, that I know of, to say\nagainst thee.”\n\n“If I were sincerely attached to thy daughter, Friend Mitchenor, and she\nreturned the attachment, could thee trust her happiness in my hands?”\n\n“What!” cried Eli, straightening himself and glaring upon the speaker,\nwith a face too amazed to express any other feeling.\n\n“Can you confide Asenath's happiness to my care? I love her with\nmy whole heart and soul, and the fortune of my life depends on your\nanswer.”\n\nThe straight lines in the old man's face seemed to grow deeper and more\nrigid, and his eyes shone with the chill glitter of steel. Richard, not\ndaring to say a word more, awaited his reply in intense agitation.\n\n“So!” he exclaimed at last, “this is the way thee's repaid me! I didn't\nexpect THIS from thee! Has thee spoken to her?”\n\n“I have.”\n\n“Thee has, has thee? And I suppose thee's persuaded her to think as\nthee does. Thee'd better never have come here. When I want to lose my\ndaughter, and can't find anybody else for her, I'll let thee know.”\n\n“What have you against me, Friend Mitchenor?” Richard sadly asked,\nforgetting, in his excitement, the Quaker speech he had learned.\n\n“Thee needn't use compliments now! Asenath shall be a Friend while _I_\nlive; thy fine clothes and merry-makings and vanities are not for\nher. Thee belongs to the world, and thee may choose one of the world's\nwomen.”\n\n“Never!” protested Richard; but Friend Mitchenor was already ascending\nthe garden-steps on his way to the house.\n\nThe young man, utterly overwhelmed, wandered to the nearest grove and\nthrew himself on the ground. Thus, in a miserable chaos of emotion,\nunable to grasp any fixed thought, the hours passed away. Towards\nevening, he heard a footstep approaching, and sprang up. It was Moses.\n\nThe latter was engaged, with the consent of his parents and expected\nto “pass meeting” in a few weeks. He knew what had happened, and felt a\nsincere sympathy for Richard, for whom he had a cordial regard. His face\nwas very grave, but kind.\n\n“Thee'd better come in, Richard,” said he; “the evenings are damp, and I\nv'e brought thy overcoat. I know everything, and I feel that it must be\na great cross for thee. But thee won't be alone in bearing it.”\n\n“Do you think there is no hope of your father relenting?” he asked, in a\ntone of despondency which anticipated the answer.\n\n“Father's very hard to move,” said Moses; “and when mother and Asenath\ncan't prevail on him, nobody else need try. I'm afraid thee must make up\nthy mind to the trial. I'm sorry to say it, Richard, but I think thee'd\nbetter go back to town.”\n\n“I'll go to-morrow,--go and die!” he muttered hoarsely, as he followed\nMoses to the house.\n\nAbigail, as she saw his haggard face, wept quietly. She pressed his hand\ntenderly, but said nothing. Eli was stern and cold as an Iceland rock.\nAsenath did not make her appearance. At supper, the old man and his son\nexchanged a few words about the farm-work to be done on the morrow, but\nnothing else was said. Richard soon left the room and went up to\nhis chamber to spend his last, his only unhappy night at the farm. A\nyearning, pitying look from Abigail accompanied him.\n\n“Try and not think hard of us!” was her farewell the next morning, as\nhe stepped into the old chair, in which Moses was to convey him to the\nvillage where he should meet the Doylestown stage. So, without a word\nof comfort from Asenath's lips, without even a last look at her beloved\nface, he was taken away.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nTrue and firm and self-reliant as was the nature of Asenath Mitchenor,\nthe thought of resistance to her father's will never crossed her mind.\nIt was fixed that she must renounce all intercourse with Richard Hilton;\nit was even sternly forbidden her to see him again during the few hours\nhe remained in the house; but the sacred love, thus rudely dragged to\nthe light and outraged, was still her own. She would take it back into\nthe keeping of her heart, and if a day should ever come when he would be\nfree to return and demand it of her, he would find it there, unwithered,\nwith all the unbreathed perfume hoarded in its folded leaves. If\nthat day came not, she would at the last give it back to God, saying,\n“Father, here is Thy most precious gift, bestow it as Thou wilt.”\n\nAs her life had never before been agitated by any strong emotion, so it\nwas not outwardly agitated now. The placid waters of her soul did not\nheave and toss before those winds of passion and sorrow: they lay in\ndull, leaden calm, under a cold and sunless sky. What struggles\nwith herself she underwent no one ever knew. After Richard Hilton's\ndeparture, she never mentioned his name, or referred, in any way, to the\nsummer's companionship with him. She performed her household duties, if\nnot cheerfully, at least as punctually and carefully as before; and her\nfather congratulated himself that the unfortunate attachment had struck\nno deeper root. Abigail's finer sight, however, was not deceived by this\nexternal resignation. She noted the faint shadows under the eyes, the\nincreased whiteness of the temples, the unconscious traces of pain which\nsometimes played about the dimpled corners of the mouth, and watched her\ndaughter with a silent, tender solicitude.\n\nThe wedding of Moses was a severe test of Asenath's strength, but\nshe stood the trial nobly, performing all the duties required by her\nposition with such sweet composure that many of the older female Friends\nremarked to Abigail, “How womanly Asenath has grown!” Eli Mitchenor\nnoted, with peculiar satisfaction, that the eyes of the young\nFriends--some of them of great promise in the sect, and well endowed\nwith worldly goods--followed her admiringly.\n\n“It will not be long,” he thought, “before she is consoled.”\n\nFortune seemed to favor his plans, and justify his harsh treatment\nof Richard Hilton. There were unfavorable accounts of the young man's\nconduct. His father had died during the winter, and he was represented\nas having become very reckless and dissipated. These reports at last\nassumed such a definite form that Friend Mitchenor brought them to the\nnotice of his family.\n\n“I met Josiah Comly in the road,” said he, one day at dinner. “He's\njust come from Philadelphia, and brings bad news of Richard Hilton. He's\ntaken to drink, and is spending in wickedness the money his father left\nhim. His friends have a great concern about him, but it seems he's not\nto be reclaimed.”\n\nAbigail looked imploringly at her husband, but he either disregarded\nor failed to understand her look. Asenath, who had grown very pale,\nsteadily met her father's gaze, and said, in a tone which he had never\nyet heard from her lips--\n\n“Father, will thee please never mention Richard Hilton's name when I am\nby?”\n\nThe words were those of entreaty, but the voice was that of authority.\nThe old man was silenced by a new and unexpected power in his daughter's\nheart: he suddenly felt that she was not a girl, as heretofore, but a\nwoman, whom he might persuade, but could no longer compel.\n\n“It shall be as thee wishes, Asenath,” he said; “we had best forget\nhim.”\n\nOf their friends, however, she could not expect this reserve, and she\nwas doomed to hear stories of Richard which clouded and embittered her\nthoughts of him. And a still severer trial was in store. She accompanied\nher father, in obedience to his wish, and against her own desire, to the\nYearly Meeting in Philadelphia. It has passed into a proverb that the\nFriends, on these occasions, always bring rain with them; and the period\nof her visit was no exception to the rule. The showery days of “Yearly\nMeeting Week” glided by, until the last, and she looked forward with\nrelief to the morrow's return to Bucks County, glad to have escaped a\nmeeting with Richard Hilton, which might have confirmed her fears and\ncould but have given her pain in any case.\n\nAs she and her father joined each other, outside the meeting-house, at\nthe close of the afternoon meeting, a light rain was falling. She took\nhis arm, under the capacious umbrella, and they were soon alone in the\nwet streets, on their way to the house of the Friends who entertained\nthem. At a crossing, where the water pouring down the gutter towards\nthe Delaware, caused them to halt a man, plashing through the flood,\nstaggered towards them. Without an umbrella, with dripping, disordered\nclothes, yet with a hot, flushed face, around which the long black hair\nhung wildly, he approached, singing to himself with maudlin voice a\nsong that would have been sweet and tender in a lover's mouth. Friend\nMitchenor drew to one side, lest his spotless drab should be brushed by\nthe unclean reveller; but the latter, looking up, stopped suddenly face\nto face with them.\n\n“Asenath!” he cried, in a voice whose anguish pierced through the\nconfusion of his senses, and struck down into the sober quick of his\nsoul.\n\n“Richard!” she breathed, rather than spoke, in a low, terrified voice.\n\nIt was indeed Richard Hilton who stood before her, or rather--as she\nafterwards thought, in recalling the interview--the body of Richard\nHilton possessed by an evil spirit. His cheeks burned with a more than\nhectic red, his eyes were wild and bloodshot, and though the recognition\nhad suddenly sobered him, an impatient, reckless devil seemed to lurk\nunder the set mask of his features.\n\n“Here I am, Asenath,” he said at length, hoarsely. “I said it was death,\ndidn't I? Well, it's worse than death, I suppose; but what matter? You\ncan't be more lost to me now than you were already. This is THY doing,\nFriend Eli,” he continued, turning to the old man, with a sneering\nemphasis on the “THY.” “I hope thee's satisfied with thy work!”\n\nHere he burst into a bitter, mocking laugh, which it chilled Asenath's\nblood to hear.\n\nThe old man turned pale. “Come away, child!” said he, tugging at her\narm. But she stood firm, strengthened for the moment by a solemn feeling\nof duty which trampled down her pain.\n\n“Richard,” she said, with the music of an immeasurable sorrow in\nher voice, “oh, Richard, what has thee done? Where the Lord commands\nresignation, thee has been rebellious; where he chasteneth to purify,\nthee turns blindly to sin. I had not expected this of thee, Richard; I\nthought thy regard for me was of the kind which would have helped and\nuplifted thee,--not through me, as an unworthy object, but through the\nhopes and the pure desires of thy own heart. I expected that thee would\nso act as to justify what I felt towards thee, not to make my affection\na reproach,--oh, Richard, not to cast over my heart the shadow of thy\nsin!”\n\nThe wretched young man supported himself against the post of an awning,\nburied his face in his hands, and wept passionately. Once or twice he\nessayed to speak, but his voice was choked by sobs, and, after a look\nfrom the streaming eyes which Asenath could scarcely bear to meet, he\nagain covered his face. A stranger, coming down the street, paused out\nof curiosity. “Come, come!” cried Eli, once more, eager to escape from\nthe scene. His daughter stood still, and the man slowly passed on.\n\nAsenath could not thus leave her lost lover, in his despairing grief.\nShe again turned to him, her own tears flowing fast and free.\n\n“I do not judge thee, Richard, but the words that passed between us give\nme a right to speak to thee. It was hard to lose sight of thee then, but\nit is still harder for me to see thee now. If the sorrow and pity I feel\ncould save thee, I would be willing never to know any other feelings. I\nwould still do anything for thee except that which thee cannot ask, as\nthee now is, and I could not give. Thee has made the gulf between us so\nwide that it cannot be crossed. But I can now weep for thee and pray for\nthee as a fellow-creature whose soul is still precious in the sight of\nthe Lord. Fare thee well!”\n\nHe seized the hand she extended, bowed down, and showered mingled tears\nand kisses upon it. Then, with a wild sob in his throat, he started up\nand rushed down the street, through the fast-falling rain. The father\nand daughter walked home in silence. Eli had heard every word that was\nspoken, and felt that a spirit whose utterances he dared not question\nhad visited Asenath's tongue.\n\nShe, as year after year went by, regained the peace and patience which\ngive a sober cheerfulness to life. The pangs of her heart grew dull and\ntransient; but there were two pictures in her memory which never blurred\nin outline or faded in color: one, the brake of autumn flowers under the\nbright autumnal sky, with bird and stream making accordant music to the\nnew voice of love; the other a rainy street, with a lost, reckless man\nleaning against an awning-post, and staring in her face with eyes whose\nunutterable woe, when she dared to recall it, darkened the beauty of the\nearth, and almost shook her trust in the providence of God.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nYear after year passed by, but not without bringing change to the\nMitchenor family. Moses had moved to Chester County soon after his\nmarriage, and had a good farm of his own. At the end of ten years\nAbigail died; and the old man, who had not only lost his savings by\nan unlucky investment, but was obliged to mortgage his farm, finally\ndetermined to sell it and join his son. He was getting too old to manage\nit properly, impatient under the unaccustomed pressure of debt, and\ndepressed by the loss of the wife to whom, without any outward show\nof tenderness, he was, in truth, tenderly attached. He missed her\nmore keenly in the places where she had lived and moved than in a\nneighborhood without the memory of her presence. The pang with which he\nparted from his home was weakened by the greater pang which had preceded\nit.\n\nIt was a harder trial to Asenath. She shrank from the encounter with new\nfaces, and the necessity of creating new associations. There was a quiet\nsatisfaction in the ordered, monotonous round of her life, which might\nbe the same elsewhere, but here alone was the nook which held all the\nmorning sunshine she had ever known. Here still lingered the halo of the\nsweet departed summer,--here still grew the familiar wild-flowers which\nTHE FIRST Richard Hilton had gathered. This was the Paradise in which\nthe Adam of her heart had dwelt, before his fall. Her resignation and\nsubmission entitled her to keep those pure and perfect memories, though\nshe was scarcely conscious of their true charm. She did not dare to\nexpress to herself, in words, that one everlasting joy of woman's heart,\nthrough all trials and sorrows--“I have loved, I have been beloved.”\n\nOn the last “First-day” before their departure, she walked down the\nmeadows to the lonely brake between the hills. It was the early spring,\nand the black buds of the ash had just begun to swell. The maples were\ndusted with crimson bloom, and the downy catkins of the swamp-willow\ndropped upon the stream and floated past her, as once the autumn leaves.\nIn the edges of the thickets peeped forth the blue, scentless violet,\nthe fairy cups of the anemone, and the pink-veined bells of the\nmiskodeed. The tall blooms through which the lovers walked still slept\nin the chilly earth; but the sky above her was mild and blue, and\nthe remembrance of the day came back to her with a delicate, pungent\nsweetness, like the perfume of the trailing arbutus in the air around\nher. In a sheltered, sunny nook, she found a single erythronium, lured\nforth in advance of its proper season, and gathered it as a relic of the\nspot, which she might keep without blame. As she stooped to pluck it,\nher own face looked up at her out of a little pool filled by the spring\nrains. Seen against the reflected sky, it shone with a soft radiance,\nand the earnest eyes met hers, as if it were her young self, evoked from\nthe past, to bid her farewell. “Farewell!” she whispered, taking leave\nat once, as she believed, of youth and the memory of love.\n\nDuring those years she had more than once been sought in marriage, but\nhad steadily, though kindly, refused. Once, when the suitor was a\nman whose character and position made the union very desirable in Eli\nMitchenor's eyes, he ventured to use his paternal influence. Asenath's\ngentle resistance was overborne by his arbitrary force of will, and her\nprotestations were of no avail.\n\n“Father,” she finally said, in the tone which he had once heard and\nstill remembered, “thee can take away, but thee cannot give.”\n\nHe never mentioned the subject again.\n\nRichard Hilton passed out of her knowledge shortly after her meeting\nwith him in Philadelphia. She heard, indeed, that his headlong career\nof dissipation was not arrested,--that his friends had given him up as\nhopelessly ruined,--and, finally, that he had left the city. After\nthat, all reports ceased. He was either dead, or reclaimed and leading\na better life, somewhere far away. Dead, she believed--almost hoped; for\nin that case might he not now be enjoying the ineffable rest and peace\nwhich she trusted might be her portion? It was better to think of him\nas a purified spirit, waiting to meet her in a holier communion, than to\nknow that he was still bearing the burden of a soiled and blighted\nlife. In any case, her own future was plain and clear. It was simply a\nprolongation of the present--an alternation of seed-time and harvest,\nfilled with humble duties and cares, until the Master should bid her lay\ndown her load and follow Him.\n\nFriend Mitchenor bought a small cottage adjacent to his son's farm, in a\ncommunity which consisted mostly of Friends, and not far from the large\nold meeting-house in which the Quarterly Meetings were held. He at once\ntook his place on the upper seat, among the elders, most of whom he knew\nalready, from having met them, year after year, in Philadelphia. The\ncharge of a few acres of ground gave him sufficient occupation; the\nmoney left to him after the sale of his farm was enough to support him\ncomfortably; and a late Indian summer of contentment seemed now to have\ncome to the old man. He was done with the earnest business of life.\nMoses was gradually taking his place, as father and Friend; and Asenath\nwould be reasonably provided for at his death. As his bodily energies\ndecayed, his imperious temper softened, his mind became more accessible\nto liberal influences, and he even cultivated a cordial friendship\nwith a neighboring farmer who was one of “the world's people.” Thus, at\nseventy-five he was really younger, because tenderer of heart and more\nconsiderate, than he had been at sixty.\n\nAsenath was now a woman of thirty-five, and suitors had ceased to\napproach her. Much of her beauty still remained, but her face had become\nthin and wasted, and the inevitable lines were beginning to form around\nher eyes. Her dress was plainer than ever, and she wore the scoop-bonnet\nof drab silk, in which no woman can seem beautiful, unless she be very\nold. She was calm and grave in her demeanor, save that her perfect\ngoodness and benevolence shone through and warmed her presence; but,\nwhen earnestly interested, she had been known to speak her mind so\nclearly and forcibly that it was generally surmised among the Friends\nthat she possessed “a gift,” which might, in time, raise her to honor\namong them. To the children of Moses she was a good genius, and a word\nfrom “Aunt 'Senath” oftentimes prevailed when the authority of the\nparents was disregarded. In them she found a new source of happiness;\nand when her old home on the Neshaminy had been removed a little farther\ninto the past, so that she no longer looked, with every morning's sun,\nfor some familiar feature of its scenery, her submission brightened into\na cheerful content with life.\n\nIt was summer, and Quarterly-Meeting Day had arrived. There had been\nrumors of the expected presence of “Friends from a distance,” and not\nonly those of the district, but most of the neighbors who were not\nconnected with the sect, attended. By the by-road, through the woods,\nit was not more than half a mile from Friend Mitchenor's cottage to the\nmeeting-house, and Asenath, leaving her father to be taken by Moses in\nhis carriage, set out on foot. It was a sparkling, breezy day, and the\nforest was full of life. Squirrels chased each other along the\nbranches of the oaks, and the air was filled with fragrant odors of\nhickory-leaves, sweet fern, and spice-wood. Picking up a flower here\nand there, Asenath walked onward, rejoicing alike in shade and sunshine,\ngrateful for all the consoling beauty which the earth offers to a lonely\nheart. That serene content which she had learned to call happiness had\nfilled her being until the dark canopy was lifted and the waters took\nback their transparency under a cloudless sky.\n\nPassing around to the “women's side” of the meeting-house, she mingled\nwith her friends, who were exchanging information concerning the\nexpected visitors. Micajah Morrill had not arrived, they said, but Ruth\nBaxter had spent the last night at Friend Way's, and would certainly\nbe there. Besides, there were Friend Chandler, from Nine Partners, and\nFriend Carter, from Maryland: they had been seen on the ground. Friend\nCarter was said to have a wonderful gift,--Mercy Jackson had heard him\nonce, in Baltimore. The Friends there had been a little exercised about\nhim, because they thought he was too much inclined to “the newness,”\n but it was known that the Spirit had often manifestly led him. Friend\nChandler had visited Yearly Meeting once, they believed. He was an old\nman, and had been a personal friend of Elias Hicks.\n\nAt the appointed hour they entered the house. After the subdued rustling\nwhich ensued upon taking their seats, there was an interval of silence,\nshorter than usual, because it was evident that many persons would\nfeel the promptings of the Spirit. Friend Chandler spoke first, and was\nfollowed by Ruth Baxter, a frail little woman, with a voice of exceeding\npower. The not unmelodious chant in which she delivered her admonitions\nrang out, at times, like the peal of a trumpet. Fixing her eyes on\nvacancy, with her hands on the wooden rail before her, and her\nbody slightly swaying to and fro, her voice soared far aloft at the\ncommencement of every sentence, gradually dropping, through a melodious\nscale of tone, to the close. She resembled an inspired prophetess, an\naged Deborah, crying aloud in the valleys of Israel.\n\nThe last speaker was Friend Carter, a small man, not more than forty\nyears of age. His face was thin and intense in its expression, his hair\ngray at the temples, and his dark eye almost too restless for a child of\n“the stillness and the quietness.” His voice, though not loud, was clear\nand penetrating, with an earnest, sympathetic quality, which arrested,\nnot the ear alone, but the serious attention of the auditor. His\ndelivery was but slightly marked by the peculiar rhythm of the Quaker\npreachers; and this fact, perhaps, increased the effect of his words,\nthrough the contrast with those who preceded him.\n\nHis discourse was an eloquent vindication of the law of kindness, as the\nhighest and purest manifestation of true Christian doctrine.\n\nThe paternal relation of God to man was the basis of that religion which\nappealed directly to the heart: so the fraternity of each man with his\nfellow was its practical application. God pardons the repentant sinner:\nwe can also pardon, where we are offended; we can pity, where we cannot\npardon. Both the good and the bad principles generate their like in\nothers. Force begets force; anger excites a corresponding anger; but\nkindness awakens the slumbering emotions even of an evil heart. Love may\nnot always be answered by an equal love, but it has never yet created\nhatred. The testimony which Friends bear against war, he said, is but a\ngeneral assertion, which has no value except in so far as they manifest\nthe principle of peace in their daily lives--in the exercise of pity, of\ncharity, of forbearance, and Christian love.\n\nThe words of the speaker sank deeply into the hearts of his hearers.\nThere was an intense hush, as if in truth the Spirit had moved him to\nspeak, and every sentence was armed with a sacred authority. Asenath\nMitchenor looked at him, over the low partition which divided her and\nher sisters from the men's side, absorbed in his rapt earnestness and\ntruth. She forgot that other hearers were present: he spake to her\nalone. A strange spell seemed to seize upon her faculties and chain them\nat his feet: had he beckoned to her, she would have arisen and walked to\nhis side.\n\nFriend Carter warmed and deepened as he went on. “I feel moved to-day,”\n he said,--“moved, I know not why, but I hope for some wise purpose,--to\nrelate to you an instance of Divine and human kindness which has come\ndirectly to my own knowledge. A young man of delicate constitution,\nwhose lungs were thought to be seriously affected, was sent to the\nhouse of a Friend in the country, in order to try the effect of air and\nexercise.”\n\nAsenath almost ceased to breathe, in the intensity with which she gazed\nand listened. Clasping her hands tightly in her lap to prevent them from\ntrembling, and steadying herself against the back of the seat, she\nheard the story of her love for Richard Hilton told by the lips of\na stranger!--not merely of his dismissal from the house, but of that\nmeeting in the street, at which only she and her father were present!\nNay, more, she heard her own words repeated, she heard Richard's\npassionate outburst of remorse described in language that brought his\nliving face before her! She gasped for breath--his face WAS before her!\nThe features, sharpened by despairing grief, which her memory recalled,\nhad almost anticipated the harder lines which fifteen years had made,\nand which now, with a terrible shock and choking leap of the heart, she\nrecognized. Her senses faded, and she would have fallen from her\nseat but for the support of the partition against which she leaned.\nFortunately, the women near her were too much occupied with the\nnarrative to notice her condition. Many of them wept silently, with\ntheir handkerchiefs pressed over their mouths.\n\nThe first shock of death-like faintness passed away, and she clung to\nthe speaker's voice, as if its sound alone could give her strength to\nsit still and listen further.\n\n“Deserted by his friends, unable to stay his feet on the evil path,” he\ncontinued, “the young man left his home and went to a city in another\nState. But here it was easier to find associates in evil than tender\nhearts that might help him back to good. He was tired of life, and the\nhope of a speedier death hardened him in his courses. But, my friends,\nDeath never comes to those who wickedly seek him. The Lord withholds\ndestruction from the hands that are madly outstretched to grasp it, and\nforces His pity and forgiveness on the unwilling soul. Finding that it\nwas the principle of LIFE which grew stronger within him, the young\nman at last meditated an awful crime. The thought of self-destruction\nhaunted him day and night. He lingered around the wharves, gazing into\nthe deep waters, and was restrained from the deed only by the memory of\nthe last loving voice he had heard. One gloomy evening, when even this\nmemory had faded, and he awaited the approaching darkness to make his\ndesign secure, a hand was laid on his arm. A man in the simple garb of\nthe Friends stood beside him, and a face which reflected the kindness of\nthe Divine Father looked upon him. 'My child,' said he, 'I am drawn to\nthee by the great trouble of thy mind. Shall I tell thee what it is thee\nmeditates?' The young man shook his head. 'I will be silent, then, but\nI will save thee. I know the human heart, and its trials and weaknesses,\nand it may be put into my mouth to give thee strength.' He took the\nyoung man's hand, as if he had been a little child, and led him to his\nhome. He heard the sad story, from beginning to end; and the young man\nwept upon his breast, to hear no word of reproach, but only the largest\nand tenderest pity bestowed upon him. They knelt down, side by side,\nat midnight; and the Friend's right hand was upon his head while they\nprayed.\n\n“The young man was rescued from his evil ways, to acknowledge still\nfurther the boundless mercy of Providence. The dissipation wherein he\nhad recklessly sought death was, for him, a marvellous restoration to\nlife. His lungs had become sound and free from the tendency to disease.\nThe measure of his forgiveness was almost more than he could bear.\nHe bore his cross thenceforward with a joyful resignation, and was\nmercifully drawn nearer and nearer to the Truth, until, in the fulness\nof his convictions, he entered into the brotherhood of the Friends.\n\n“I have been powerfully moved to tell you this story.” Friend Carter\nconcluded, “from a feeling that it may be needed, here, at this time, to\ninfluence some heart trembling in the balance. Who is there among you,\nmy friends, that may not snatch a brand from the burning! Oh, believe\nthat pity and charity are the most effectual weapons given into the\nhands of us imperfect mortals, and leave the awful attribute of wrath in\nthe hands of the Lord!”\n\nHe sat down, and dead silence ensued. Tears of emotion stood in the\neyes of the hearers, men as well as women, and tears of gratitude and\nthanksgiving gushed warmly from those of Asenath. An ineffable peace and\njoy descended upon her heart.\n\nWhen the meeting broke up, Friend Mitchenor, who had not recognized\nRichard Hilton, but had heard the story with feelings which he\nendeavored in vain to control, approached the preacher.\n\n“The Lord spoke to me this day through thy lips,” said he; “will thee\ncome to one side, and hear me a minute?”\n\n“Eli Mitchenor!” exclaimed Friend Carter; “Eli! I knew not thee was\nhere! Doesn't thee know me?”\n\nThe old man stared in astonishment. “It seems like a face I ought to\nknow,” he said, “but I can't place thee.” They withdrew to the shade\nof one of the poplars. Friend Carter turned again, much moved, and,\ngrasping the old man's hands in his own, exclaimed--\n\n“Friend Mitchenor, I was called upon to-day to speak of myself. I\nam--or, rather, I WAS--the Richard Hilton whom thee knew.”\n\nFriend Mitchenor's face flushed with mingled emotions of shame and joy,\nand his grasp on the preacher's hands tightened.\n\n“But thee calls thyself Carter?” he finally said.\n\n“Soon after I was saved,” was the reply, “an aunt on the mother's side\ndied, and left her property to me, on condition that I should take her\nname. I was tired of my own then, and to give it up seemed only like\nlosing my former self; but I should like to have it back again now.”\n\n“Wonderful are the ways of the Lord, and past finding out!” said the\nold man. “Come home with me, Richard,--come for my sake, for there is a\nconcern on my mind until all is clear between us. Or, stay,--will thee\nwalk home with Asenath, while I go with Moses?”\n\n“Asenath?”\n\n“Yes. There she goes, through the gate. Thee can easily overtake her. I\n'm coming, Moses!”--and he hurried away to his son's carriage, which was\napproaching.\n\nAsenath felt that it would be impossible for her to meet Richard Hilton\nthere. She knew not why his name had been changed; he had not betrayed\nhis identity with the young man of his story; he evidently did not wish\nit to be known, and an unexpected meeting with her might surprise him\ninto an involuntary revelation of the fact. It was enough for her that a\nsaviour had arisen, and her lost Adam was redeemed,--that a holier light\nthan the autumn sun's now rested, and would forever rest, on the one\nlandscape of her youth. Her eyes shone with the pure brightness of\ngirlhood, a soft warmth colored her cheek and smoothed away the coming\nlines of her brow, and her step was light and elastic as in the old\ntime.\n\nEager to escape from the crowd, she crossed the highway, dusty with its\nstring of returning carriages, and entered the secluded lane. The breeze\nhad died away, the air was full of insect-sounds, and the warm light\nof the sinking sun fell upon the woods and meadows. Nature seemed\npenetrated with a sympathy with her own inner peace.\n\nBut the crown of the benignant day was yet to come. A quick footstep\nfollowed her, and ere long a voice, near at hand, called her by name.\n\nShe stopped, turned, and for a moment they stood silent, face to face.\n\n“I knew thee, Richard!” at last she said, in a trembling voice; “may the\nLord bless thee!”\n\nTears were in the eyes of both.\n\n“He has blessed me,” Richard answered, in a reverent tone; “and this\nis His last and sweetest mercy. Asenath, let me hear that thee forgives\nme.”\n\n“I have forgiven thee long ago, Richard--forgiven, but not forgotten.”\n\nThe hush of sunset was on the forest, as they walked onward, side by\nside, exchanging their mutual histories. Not a leaf stirred in the\ncrowns of the tall trees, and the dusk, creeping along between their\nstems, brought with it a richer woodland odor. Their voices were low\nand subdued, as if an angel of God were hovering in the shadows, and\nlistening, or God Himself looked down upon them from the violet sky.\n\nAt last Richard stopped.\n\n“Asenath,” said he, “does thee remember that spot on the banks of the\ncreek, where the rudbeckias grew?”\n\n“I remember it,” she answered, a girlish blush rising to her face.\n\n“If I were to say to thee now what I said to thee there, what would be\nthy answer?”\n\nHer words came brokenly.\n\n“I would say to thee, Richard,--'I can trust thee,--I DO love thee!'”\n\n“Look at me, Asenath.”\n\nHer eyes, beaming with a clearer light than even then when she first\nconfessed, were lifted to his. She placed her hands gently upon his\nshoulders, and bent her head upon his breast. He tenderly lifted it\nagain, and, for the first time, her virgin lips knew the kiss of man.\n\n\n\n\nMISS BARTRAM'S TROUBLE.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nIt was a day of unusual excitement at the Rambo farm-house. On the farm,\nit is true, all things were in their accustomed order, and all growths\ndid their accustomed credit to the season. The fences were in good\nrepair; the cattle were healthy and gave promise of the normal increase,\nand the young corn was neither strangled with weeds nor assassinated\nby cut-worms. Old John Rambo was gradually allowing his son, Henry, to\nmanage in his stead, and the latter shrewdly permitted his father to\nbelieve that he exercised the ancient authority. Leonard Clare, the\nstrong young fellow who had been taken from that shiftless adventurer,\nhis father, when a mere child, and brought up almost as one of the\nfamily, and who had worked as a joiner's apprentice during the previous\nsix months, had come back for the harvest work; so the Rambos were\nforehanded, and probably as well satisfied as it is possible for\nPennsylvania farmers to be.\n\nIn the house, also, Mrs. Priscilla Rambo was not severely haunted by\nthe spectre of any neglected duty. The simple regular routine of the\nhousehold could not be changed under her charge; each thing had its\nappropriate order of performance, must be done, and WAS done. If\nthe season were backward, at the time appointed for whitewashing or\nsoap-making, so much the worse for the season; if the unhatched goslings\nwere slain by thunder, she laid the blame on the thunder. And if--but\nno, it is quite impossible to suppose that, outside of those two\ninevitable, fearful house-cleaning weeks in each year, there could have\nbeen any disorder in the cold prim, varnish-odored best rooms, sacred to\ncompany.\n\nIt was Miss Betty Rambo, whose pulse beat some ten strokes faster than\nits wont, as she sat down with the rest to their early country dinner.\nWhether her brother Henry's participated in the accelerated movement\ncould not be guessed from his demeanor. She glanced at him now and then,\nwith bright eyes and flushed cheeks, eager to speak yet shrinking\nfrom the half magisterial air which was beginning to supplant his old\nfamiliar banter. Henry was changing with his new responsibility, as\nshe admitted to herself with a sort of dismay; he had the airs of an\nindependent farmer, and she remained only a farmer's daughter,--without\nany acknowledged rights, until she should acquire them all, at a single\nblow, by marriage.\n\nNevertheless, he must have felt what was in her mind; for, as he cut out\nthe quarter of a dried apple pie, he said carelessly:\n\n“I must go down to the Lion, this afternoon. There's a fresh drove of\nMaryland cattle just come.”\n\n“Oh Harry!” cried Betty, in real distress.\n\n“I know,” he answered; “but as Miss Bartram is going to stay two weeks,\nshe'll keep. She's not like a drove, that's here one day, and away the\nnext. Besides, it is precious little good I shall have of her society,\nuntil you two have used up all your secrets and small talk. I know how\nit is with girls. Leonard will drive over to meet the train.”\n\n“Won't I do on a pinch?” Leonard asked.\n\n“Oh, to be sure,” said Betty, a little embarrassed, “only Alice--Miss\nBartram--might expect Harry, because her brother came for me when I went\nup.”\n\n“If that's all, make yourself easy, Bet,” Henry answered, as he rose\nfrom the table. “There's a mighty difference between here and there.\nUnless you mean to turn us into a town family while she stays--high\nquality, eh?”\n\n“Go along to your cattle! there's not much quality, high or low, where\nyou are.”\n\nBetty was indignant; but the annoyance exhausted itself healthfully\nwhile she was clearing away the dishes and restoring the room to its\norder, so that when Leonard drove up to the gate with the lumbering,\nold-fashioned carriage two hours afterwards, she came forth calm,\ncheerful, fresh as a pink in her pink muslin, and entirely the good,\nsensible country-girl she was.\n\nTwo or three years before, she and Miss Alice Bartram, daughter of the\ndistinguished lawyer in the city, had been room-mates at the Nereid\nSeminary for Young Ladies. Each liked the other for the contrast to her\nown self; both were honest, good and lovable, but Betty had the stronger\nnerves and a practical sense which seemed to be admirable courage in\nthe eyes of Miss Alice, whose instincts were more delicate, whose tastes\nwere fine and high, and who could not conceive of life without certain\nluxurious accessories. A very cordial friendship sprang up between\nthem,--not the effusive girl-love, with its iterative kisses, tears, and\nflow of loosened hair, but springing from the respect inspired by sound\nand positive qualities.\n\nThe winter before, Betty had been invited to visit her friend in the\ncity, and had passed a very excited and delightful week in the stately\nBartram mansion. If she were at first a little fluttered by the manners\nof the new world, she was intelligent enough to carry her own nature\nfrankly through it, instead of endeavoring to assume its character.\nThus her little awkwardnesses became originalities, and she was almost\npopular in the lofty circle when she withdrew from it. It was therefore,\nperhaps, slightly inconsistent in Betty, that she was not quite sure how\nMiss Bartram would accept the reverse side of this social experience.\nShe imagined it easier to look down and make allowances, as a host, than\nas a guest; she could not understand that the charm of the change might\nbe fully equal.\n\nIt was lovely weather, as they drove up the sweet, ever-changing\ncurves of the Brandywine valley. The woods fairly laughed in the clear\nsunlight, and the soft, incessant, shifting breezes. Leonard, in his\nbest clothes, and with a smoother gloss on his brown hair, sang to\nhimself as he urged the strong-boned horses into a trot along the\nlevels; and Betty finally felt so quietly happy that she forgot to be\nnervous. When they reached the station they walked up and down the\nlong platform together, until the train from the city thundered up,\nand painfully restrained its speed. Then Betty, catching sight of a\nfawn-colored travelling dress issuing from the ladies' car, caught hold\nof Leonard's arm, and cried: “There she is!”\n\nMiss Bartram heard the words, and looked down with a bright, glad\nexpression on her face. It was not her beauty that made Leonard's heart\nsuddenly stop beating; for she was not considered a beauty, in society.\nIt was something rarer than perfect beauty, yet even more difficult\nto describe,--a serene, unconscious grace, a pure, lofty maturity of\nwomanhood, such as our souls bow down to in the Santa Barbara of Palma\nVecchio. Her features were not “faultlessly regular,” but they were\ninformed with the finer harmonies of her character. She was a woman,\nat whose feet a noble man might kneel, lay his forehead on her knee,\nconfess his sins, and be pardoned.\n\nShe stepped down to the platform, and Betty's arms were about her. After\na double embrace she gently disengaged herself, turned to Leonard, gave\nhim her hand, and said, with a smile which was delightfully frank and\ncordial: “I will not wait for Betty's introduction, Mr. Rambo. She\nhas talked to me so much of her brother Harry, that I quite know you\nalready.”\n\nLeonard could neither withdraw his eyes nor his hand. It was like a\ndouble burst of warmth and sunshine, in which his breast seemed to\nexpand, his stature to grow, and his whole nature to throb with some new\nand wonderful force. A faint color came into Miss Bartram's cheeks, as\nthey stood thus, for a moment, face to face. She seemed to be waiting\nfor him to speak, but of this he never thought; had any words come to\nhis mind, his tongue could not have uttered them.\n\n“It is not Harry,” Betty explained, striving to hide her embarrassment.\n“This is Leonard Clare, who lives with us.”\n\n“Then I do not know you so well as I thought,” Miss Bartram said to him;\n“it is the beginning of a new acquaintance, after all.”\n\n“There isn't no harm done,” Leonard answered, and instantly feeling the\nawkwardness of the words, blushed so painfully that Miss Bartram felt\nthe inadequacy of her social tact to relieve so manifest a case of\ndistress. But she did, instinctively, what was really best: she gave\nLeonard the check for her trunk, divided her satchels with Betty, and\nwalked to the carriage.\n\nHe did not sing, as he drove homewards down the valley. Seated on the\ntrunk, in front, he quietly governed the horses, while the two girls, on\nthe seat behind him, talked constantly and gaily. Only the rich, steady\ntones of Miss Bartram's voice WOULD make their way into his ears, and\nevery light, careless sentence printed itself upon his memory. They came\nto him as if from some inaccessible planet. Poor fellow! he was not the\nfirst to feel “the desire of the moth for the star.”\n\nWhen they reached the Rambo farm-house, it was necessary that he should\ngive his hand to help her down from the clumsy carriage. He held it but\na moment; yet in that moment a gentle pulse throbbed upon his hard palm,\nand he mechanically set his teeth, to keep down the impulse which made\nhim wild to hold it there forever. “Thank you, Mr. Clare!” said\nMiss Bartram, and passed into the house. When he followed presently,\nshouldering her trunk into the upper best-room, and kneeling upon the\nfloor to unbuckle the straps, she found herself wondering: “Is this\na knightly service, or the menial duty of a porter? Can a man be both\nsensitive and ignorant, chivalrous and vulgar?”\n\nThe question was not so easily decided, though no one guessed how much\nMiss Bartram pondered it, during the succeeding days. She insisted, from\nthe first, that her coming should make no change in the habits of the\nhousehold; she rose in the cool, dewy summer dawns, dined at noon in the\nold brown room beside the kitchen, and only differed from the Rambos\nin sitting at her moonlit window, and breathing the subtle odors of a\nmyriad leaves, long after Betty was sleeping the sleep of health.\n\nIt was strange how frequently the strong, not very graceful figure of\nLeonard Clare marched through these reveries. She occasionally spoke to\nhim at the common table, or as she passed the borders of the hay-field,\nwhere he and Henry were at work: but his words to her were always few\nand constrained. What was there in his eyes that haunted her? Not merely\na most reverent admiration of her pure womanly refinement, although she\nread that also; not a fear of disparagement, such as his awkward speech\nimplied, but something which seemed to seek agonizingly for another\nlanguage than that of the lips,--something which appealed to her from\nequal ground, and asked for an answer.\n\nOne evening she met him in the lane, as she returned from the meadow.\nShe carried a bunch of flowers, with delicate blue and lilac bells, and\nasked him the name.\n\n“Them's Brandywine cowslips,” he answered; “I never heard no other name.\n\n“May I correct you?” she said, gently, and with a smile which she meant\nto be playful. “I suppose the main thing is to speak one's thought, but\nthere are neat and orderly ways, and there are careless ways.” Thereupon\nshe pointed out the inaccuracies of his answer, he standing beside her,\nsilent and attentive. When she ceased, he did not immediately reply.\n\n“You will take it in good part, will you not?” she continued. “I hope I\nhave not offended you.”\n\n“No!” he exclaimed, firmly, lifting his head, and looking at her. The\ninscrutable expression in his dark gray eyes was stronger than before,\nand all his features were more clearly drawn. He reminded her of a\npicture of Adam which she had once seen: there was the same rather low\nforehead, straight, even brows, full yet strong mouth, and that broader\nform of chin which repeats and balances the character of the forehead.\nHe was not positively handsome, but from head to foot he expressed a\nfresh, sound quality of manhood.\n\nAnother question flashed across Miss Bartram's mind: Is life long enough\nto transform this clay into marble? Here is a man in form, and with\nall the dignity of the perfect masculine nature: shall the broad, free\nintelligence, the grace and sweetness, the taste and refinement, which\nthe best culture gives, never be his also? If not, woman must be content\nwith faulty representations of her ideal.\n\nSo musing, she walked on to the farm-house. Leonard had picked up one\nof the blossoms she had let fall, and appeared to be curiously examining\nit. If he had apologized for his want of grammar, or promised to reform\nit, her interest in him might have diminished; but his silence, his\nsimple, natural obedience to some powerful inner force, whatever it\nwas, helped to strengthen that phantom of him in her mind, which was now\nbeginning to be a serious trouble.\n\nOnce again, the day before she left the Rambo farmhouse to return to the\ncity, she came upon him, alone. She had wandered off to the Brandywine,\nto gather ferns at a rocky point where some choice varieties were to\nbe found. There were a few charming clumps, half-way up a slaty cliff,\nwhich it did not seem possible to scale, and she was standing at the\nbase, looking up in vain longing, when a voice, almost at her ear, said:\n\n“Which ones do you want?”\n\nAfterwards, she wondered that she did not start at the voice. Leonard\nhad come up the road from one of the lower fields: he wore neither\ncoat nor waistcoat, and his shirt, open at the throat, showed the firm,\nbeautiful white of the flesh below the strong tan of his neck. Miss\nBartram noticed the sinewy strength and elasticity of his form, yet when\nshe looked again at the ferns, she shook her head, and answered:\n\n“None, since I cannot have them.”\n\nWithout saying a word, he took off his shoes, and commenced climbing the\nnearly perpendicular face of the cliff. He had done it before, many a\ntime; but Miss Bartram, although she was familiar with such exploits\nfrom the pages of many novels, had never seen the reality, and it quite\ntook away her breath.\n\nWhen he descended with the ferns in his hand, she said: “It was a great\nrisk; I wish I had not wanted them.”\n\n“It was no risk for me,” he answered.\n\n“What can I send you in return?” she asked, as they walked forwards. “I\nam going home to-morrow.”\n\n“Betty told me,” Leonard said; “please, wait one minute.”\n\nHe stepped down to the bank of the stream, washed his hands carefully\nin the clear water, and came back to her, holding them, dripping, at his\nsides.\n\n“I am very ignorant,” he then continued,--“ignorant and rough. You are\ngood, to want to send me something, but I want nothing. Miss Bartram,\nyou are very good.”\n\nHe paused; but with all her tact and social experience, she did not know\nwhat to say.\n\n“Would you do one little thing for me--not for the ferns, that was\nnothing--no more than you do, without thinking, for all your friends?”\n\n“Oh, surely!” she said.\n\n“Might I--might I--now,--there'll be no chance tomorrow,--shake hands\nwith you?”\n\nThe words seemed to be forced from him by the strength of a fierce will.\nBoth stopped, involuntarily.\n\n“It's quite dry, you see,” said he, offering his hand. Her own sank upon\nit, palm to palm, and the fingers softly closed over each, as if with\nthe passion and sweetness of a kiss. Miss Bartram's heart came to her\neyes, and read, at last, the question in Leonard's. It was: “I as man,\nand you, as woman, are equals; will you give me time to reach you?” What\nher eyes replied she knew not. A mighty influence drew her on, and a\nmighty doubt and dread restrained her. One said: “Here is your lover,\nyour husband, your cherished partner, left by fate below your station,\nyet whom you may lift to your side! Shall man, alone, crown the humble\nmaiden,--stoop to love, and, loving, ennoble? Be you the queen, and love\nhim by the royal right of womanhood!” But the other sternly whispered:\n“How shall your fine and delicate fibres be knit into this coarse\ntexture? Ignorance, which years cannot wash away,--low instincts,\nwhat do YOU know?--all the servile side of life, which is turned from\nyou,--what madness to choose this, because some current of earthly\nmagnetism sets along your nerves? He loves you: what of that? You are\na higher being to him, and he stupidly adores you. Think,--yes, DARE to\nthink of all the prosaic realities of life, shared with him!”\n\nMiss Bartram felt herself growing dizzy. Behind the impulse which bade\nher cast herself upon his breast swept such a hot wave of shame and pain\nthat her face burned, and she dropped her eyelids to shut out the\nsight of his face. But, for one endless second, the sweeter voice spoke\nthrough their clasped hands. Perhaps he kissed hers; she did not know;\nshe only heard herself murmur:\n\n“Good-bye! Pray go on; I will rest here.”\n\nShe sat down upon a bank by the roadside, turned away her head, and\nclosed her eyes. It was long before the tumult in her nature subsided.\nIf she reflected, with a sense of relief, “nothing was said,”\n the thought immediately followed, “but all is known.” It was\nimpossible,--yes, clearly impossible; and then came such a wild longing,\nsuch an assertion of the right and truth and justice of love, as made\nher seem a miserable coward, the veriest slave of conventionalities.\n\nOut of this struggle dawned self-knowledge, and the strength which is\nborn of it. When she returned to the house, she was pale and weary, but\ncapable of responding to Betty Rambo's constant cheerfulness. The next\nday she left for the city, without having seen Leonard Clare again.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nHenry Rambo married, and brought a new mistress to the farm-house.\nBetty married, and migrated to a new home in another part of the\nState. Leonard Clare went back to his trade, and returned no more in\nharvest-time. So the pleasant farm by the Brandywine, having served its\npurpose as a background, will be seen no more in this history.\n\nMiss Bartram's inmost life, as a woman, was no longer the same. The\npoint of view from which she had beheld the world was shifted, and she\nwas obliged to remodel all her feelings and ideas to conform to it. But\nthe process was gradual, and no one stood near enough to her to remark\nit. She was occasionally suspected of that “eccentricity” which, in\na woman of five-and-twenty, is looked upon as the first symptom of a\ntendency to old-maidenhood, but which is really the sign of an earnest\nheart struggling with the questions of life. In the society of cities,\nmost men give only the shallow, flashy surface of their natures to the\nyoung women they meet, and Miss Bartram, after that revelation of the\ndumb strength of an ignorant man, sometimes grew very impatient of the\nplatitudes and affectations which came to her clad in elegant words, and\naccompanied by irreproachable manners.\n\nShe had various suitors; for that sense of grace and repose and sweet\nfeminine power, which hung around her like an atmosphere, attracted\ngood and true men towards her. To some, indeed, she gave that noble,\nuntroubled friendship which is always possible between the best of the\ntwo sexes, and when she was compelled to deny the more intimate appeal,\nit was done with such frank sorrow, such delicate tenderness, that\nshe never lost the friend in losing the lover. But, as one year after\nanother went by, and the younger members of her family fell off into\ntheir separate domestic orbits, she began to shrink a little at the\nperspective of a lonely life, growing lonelier as it receded from the\nPresent.\n\nBy this time, Leonard Clare had become almost a dream to her. She had\nneither seen him nor heard of him since he let go her hand on that\nmemorable evening beside the stream. He was a strange, bewildering\nchance, a cypher concealing a secret which she could not intelligently\nread. Why should she keep the memory of that power which was, perhaps,\nsome unconscious quality of his nature (no, it was not so! something\ndeeper than reason cried:), or long since forgotten, if felt, by him?\n\nThe man whom she most esteemed came back to her. She knew the ripeness\nand harmony of his intellect, the nobility of his character, and the\ngenerosity of a feeling which would be satisfied with only a partial\nreturn. She felt sure, also, that she should never possess a sentiment\nnearer to love than that which pleaded his cause in her heart. But her\nhand lay quiet in his, her pulses were calm when he spoke, and his face,\nmanly and true as it was, never invaded her dreams. All questioning was\nvain; her heart gave no solution of the riddle. Perhaps her own want\nwas common to all lives: then she was cherishing a selfish ideal, and\nrejecting the positive good offered to her hands.\n\nAfter long hesitation she yielded. The predictions of society came to\nnaught; instead of becoming an “eccentric” spinster, Miss Bartram was\nannounced to be the affianced bride of Mr. Lawrie. A few weeks and\nmonths rolled around, and when the wedding-day came, she almost hailed\nit as the port of refuge, where she should find a placid and peaceful\nlife.\n\nThey were married by an aged clergyman, a relative of the bridegroom.\nThe cross-street where his chapel stood, fronting a Methodist\nchurch--both of the simplest form of that architecture fondly supposed\nto be Gothic,--was quite blocked up by the carriages of the party. The\npews were crowded with elegant guests, the altar was decorated with\nflowers, and the ceremony lacked nothing of its usual solemn beauty.\nThe bride was pale, but strikingly calm and self-possessed, and when\nshe moved towards the door as Mrs. Lawrie, on her husband's arm, many\nmatrons, recalling their own experience, marvelled at her unflurried\ndignity.\n\nJust as they passed out the door, and the bridal carriage was summoned,\na singular thing happened. Another bridal carriage drew up from the\nopposite side, and a newly wedded pair came forth from the portal of the\nMethodist church. Both parties stopped, face to face, divided only by\nthe narrow street. Mrs. Lawrie first noticed the flushed cheeks of the\nother bride, her white dress, rather showy than elegant, and the heavy\ngold ornaments she wore. Then she turned to the bridegroom. He was tall\nand well-formed, dressed like a gentleman, but like one who is not\nyet unconscious of his dress, and had the air of a man accustomed to\nexercise some authority.\n\nShe saw his face, and instantly all other faces disappeared. From the\nopposite brink of a tremendous gulf she looked into his eyes, and their\nblended ray of love and despair pierced her to the heart.\n\nThere was a roaring in her ears, followed a long sighing sound, like\nthat of the wind on some homeless waste; she leaned more heavily on her\nhusband's arm, leaned against his shoulder, slid slowly down into his\nsupporting clasp, and knew no more.\n\n“She's paying for her mock composure, after all,” said the matrons.\n\n“It must have been a great effort.”\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nTen years afterwards, Mrs. Lawrie went on board a steamer at\nSouthampton, bound for New York. She was travelling alone, having been\ncalled suddenly from Europe by the approaching death of her aged father.\nFor two or three days after sailing, the thick, rainy spring weather\nkept all below, except a few hardy gentlemen who crowded together on the\nlee of the smoke-stack, and kept up a stubborn cheerfulness on a very\nsmall capital of comfort. There were few cabin-passengers on board, but\nthe usual crowd of emigrants in the steerage.\n\nMrs. Lawrie's face had grown calmer and colder during these years. There\nwas yet no gray in her hair, no wrinkles about her clear eyes; each\nfeature appeared to be the same, but the pale, monotonous color\nwhich had replaced the warm bloom of her youth, gave them a different\ncharacter. The gracious dignity of her manner, the mellow tones of her\nvoice, still expressed her unchanging goodness, yet those who met her\nwere sure to feel, in some inexplicable way, that to be good is not\nalways to be happy. Perhaps, indeed, her manner was older than her face\nand form: she still attracted the interest of men, but with a certain\ndoubt and reserve.\n\nCertain it is that when she made her appearance on deck, glad of the\nblue sky and sunshine, and threw back her hood to feel the freshness of\nthe sea air, all eyes followed her movements, except those of a forlorn\nindividual, who, muffled in his cloak and apparently sea-sick, lay upon\none of the benches. The captain presently joined her, and the gentlemen\nsaw that she was bright and perfectly self-possessed in conversation:\nsome of them immediately resolved to achieve an acquaintance. The dull,\npassive existence of the beginning of every voyage, seemed to be now at\nan end. It was time for the little society of the vessel to awake, stir\nitself, and organize a life of its own, for the few remaining days.\n\nThat night, as Mrs. Lawrie was sleeping in her berth, she suddenly awoke\nwith a singular feeling of dread and suspense. She listened silently,\nbut for some time distinguished none other than the small sounds of\nnight on shipboard--the indistinct orders, the dragging of ropes,\nthe creaking of timbers, the dull, regular jar of the engine, and the\nshuffling noise of feet overhead. But, ere long, she seemed to catch\nfaint, distant sounds, that seemed like cries; then came hurry and\nconfusion on deck; then voices in the cabin, one of which said: “they\nnever can get it under, at this rate!”\n\nShe rose, dressed herself hastily, and made her way through pale and\nexcited stewards, and the bewildered passengers who were beginning\nto rush from their staterooms, to the deck. In the wild tumult which\nprevailed, she might have been thrown down and trampled under foot, had\nnot a strong arm seized her around the waist, and borne her towards the\nstern, where there were but few persons.\n\n“Wait here!” said a voice, and her protector plunged into the crowd.\n\nShe saw, instantly, the terrible fate which had fallen upon the vessel.\nThe bow was shrouded in whirls of smoke, through which dull red flashes\nbegan to show themselves; and all the length and breadth of the deck was\nfilled with a screaming, struggling, fighting mass of desperate human\nbeings. She saw the captain, officers, and a few of the crew working\nin vain against the disorder: she saw the boats filled before they were\nlowered, and heard the shrieks as they were capsized; she saw spars and\nplanks and benches cast overboard, and maddened men plunging after them;\nand then, like the sudden opening of the mouth of Hell, the relentless,\ntriumphant fire burst through the forward deck and shot up to the\nforeyard.\n\nShe was leaning against the mizen shrouds, between the coils of rope.\nNobody appeared to notice her, although the quarter-deck was fast\nfilling with persons driven back by the fire, yet still shrinking\nfrom the terror and uncertainty of the sea. She thought: “It is but\ndeath--why should I fear? The waves are at hand, to save me from all\nsuffering.” And the collective horror of hundreds of beings did not so\noverwhelm her as she had both fancied and feared; the tragedy of each\nindividual life was lost in the confusion, and was she not a sharer in\ntheir doom?\n\nSuddenly, a man stood before her with a cork life-preserver in his\nhands, and buckled it around her securely, under the arms. He was\npanting and almost exhausted, yet he strove to make his voice firm, and\neven cheerful, as he said:\n\n“We fought the cowardly devils as long as there was any hope. Two boats\nare off, and two capsized; in ten minutes more every soul must take to\nthe water. Trust to me, and I will save you or die with you!”\n\n“What else can I do?” she answered.\n\nWith a few powerful strokes of an axe, he broke off the top of the\npilot-house, bound two or three planks to it with ropes, and dragged the\nmass to the bulwarks.\n\n“The minute this goes,” he then said to her, “you go after it, and I\nfollow. Keep still when you rise to the surface.”\n\nShe left the shrouds, took hold of the planks at his side, and they\nheaved the rude raft into the sea. In an instant she was seized and\nwhirled over the side; she instinctively held her breath, felt a shock,\nfelt herself swallowed up in an awful, fathomless coldness, and then\nfound herself floating below the huge towering hull which slowly drifted\naway.\n\nIn another moment there was one at her side. “Lay your hand on my\nshoulder,” he said; and when she did so, swam for the raft, which they\nsoon reached. While she supported herself by one of the planks he so\narranged and bound together the pieces of timber that in a short time\nthey could climb upon them and rest, not much washed by the waves. The\nship drifted further and further, casting a faint, though awful, glare\nover the sea, until the light was suddenly extinguished, as the hull\nsank.\n\nThe dawn was in the sky by this time, and as it broadened they could\nsee faint specks here and there, where others, like themselves, clung to\ndrifting spars. Mrs. Lawrie shuddered with cold and the reaction from an\nexcitement which had been far more powerful than she knew at the time.\n\nHer preserver then took off his coat, wrapped it around her, and\nproduced a pocket-flask, saying; “this will support us the longest; it\nis all I could find, or bring with me.”\n\nShe sat, leaning against his shoulder, though partly turned away from\nhim: all she could say was: “you are very good.”\n\nAfter awhile he spoke, and his voice seemed changed to her ears. “You\nmust be thinking of Mr. Lawrie. It will, indeed, be terrible for him to\nhear of the disaster, before knowing that you are saved.”\n\n“God has spared him that distress,” she answered. “Mr. Lawrie died, a\nyear ago.”\n\nShe felt a start in the strong frame upon which she leaned. After a\nfew minutes of silence, he slowly shifted his position towards her, yet\nstill without facing her, and said, almost in a whisper:\n\n“You have said that I am very good. Will you put your hand in mine?”\n\nShe stretched hers eagerly and gratefully towards him. What had\nhappened? Through all the numbness of her blood, there sprang a strange\nnew warmth from his strong palm, and a pulse, which she had almost\nforgotten as a dream of the past, began to beat through her frame. She\nturned around all a-tremble, and saw his face in the glow of the coming\nday.\n\n“Leonard Clare!” she cried.\n\n“Then you have not forgotten me?”\n\n“Could one forget, when the other remembers?”\n\nThe words came involuntarily from her lips. She felt what they implied,\nthe moment afterwards, and said no more. But he kept her hand in his.\n\n“Mrs. Lawrie,” he began, after another silence, “we are hanging by a\nhair on the edge of life, but I shall gladly let that hair break, since\nI may tell you now, purely and in the hearing of God, how I have tried\nto rise to you out of the low place in which you found me. At first you\nseemed too far; but you yourself led me the first step of the way, and\nI have steadily kept my eyes on you, and followed it. When I had learned\nmy trade, I came to the city. No labor was too hard for me, no study too\ndifficult. I was becoming a new man, I saw all that was still lacking,\nand how to reach it, and I watched you, unknown, at a distance. Then I\nheard of your engagement: you were lost, and something of which I had\nbegun to dream, became insanity. I determined to trample it out of my\nlife. The daughter of the master-builder, whose first assistant I was,\nhad always favored me in her society; and I soon persuaded her to love\nme. I fancied, too, that I loved her as most married men seemed to love\ntheir wives; the union would advance me to a partnership in her father's\nbusiness, and my fortune would then be secured. You know what happened;\nbut you do not know how the sight of your face planted the old madness\nagain in my life, and made me a miserable husband, a miserable man of\nwealth, almost a scoffer at the knowledge I had acquired for your sake.\n\n“When my wife died, taking an only child with her, there was nothing\nleft to me except the mechanical ambition to make myself, without you,\nwhat I imagined I might have become, through you. I have studied and\ntravelled, lived alone and in society, until your world seemed to be\nalmost mine: but you were not there!”\n\nThe sun had risen, while they sat, rocking on their frail support. Her\nhand still lay in his, and her head rested on his shoulder. Every word\nhe spoke sank into her heart with a solemn sweetness, in which her whole\nnature was silent and satisfied. Why should she speak? He knew all.\n\nYes, it seemed that he knew. His arm stole around her, and her head was\ndrawn from his shoulder to the warm breadth of his breast.\n\nSomething hard pressed her cheek, and she lifted her hand to move it\naside. He drew forth a flat medallion case; and to the unconscious\nquestion in her face, such a sad, tender smile came to his lips, that\nshe could not repress a sudden pain. Was it the miniature of his dead\nwife?\n\nHe opened the case, and showed her, under the glass, a faded, pressed\nflower.\n\n“What is it?” she asked.\n\n“The Brandywine cowslip you dropped, when you spoke to me in the lane.\nThen it was that you showed me the first step of the way.”\n\nShe laid her head again upon his bosom. Hour after hour they sat, and\nthe light swells of the sea heaved them aimlessly to and fro, and the\nsun burned them, and the spray drenched their limbs. At last Leonard\nClare roused himself and looked around: he felt numb and faint, and he\nsaw, also, that her strength was rapidly failing.\n\n“We cannot live much longer, I fear,” he said, clasping her closely in\nhis arms. “Kiss me once, darling, and then we will die.”\n\nShe clung to him and kissed him.\n\n“There is life, not death, in your lips!” he cried. “Oh, God, if we\nshould live!”\n\nHe rose painfully to his feet, stood, tottering? on the raft, and looked\nacross the waves. Presently he began to tremble, then to sob like a\nchild, and at last spoke, through his tears:\n\n“A sail! a sail!--and heading towards us!”\n\n\n\n\nMRS. STRONGITHARM'S REPORT.\n\nMr. Editor,--If you ever read the “Burroak Banner” (which you will find\namong your exchanges, as the editor publishes your prospectus for six\nweeks every year, and sends no bill to you) my name will not be that of\na stranger. Let me throw aside all affectation of humility, and say that\nI hope it is already and not unfavorably familiar to you. I am informed\nby those who claim to know that the manuscripts of obscure writers are\npassed over by you editors without examination--in short, that I must\nfirst have a name, if I hope to make one. The fact that an article of\nthree hundred and seventy-five pages, which I sent, successively, to the\n“North American Review,” the “Catholic World,” and the “Radical,” was in\neach case returned to me with MY knot on the tape by which it was tied,\nconvinces me that such is indeed the case. A few years ago I should not\nhave meekly submitted to treatment like this; but late experiences have\ntaught me the vanity of many womanly dreams.\n\nYou are acquainted with the part I took (I am SURE you must have seen\nit in the “Burroak Banner” eight years ago) in creating that public\nsentiment in our favor which invested us with all the civil and\npolitical rights of men. How the editors of the “Revolution,” to which\nI subscribe, and the conventions in favor of the equal rights of women,\nrecently held in Boston and other cities, have failed to notice our\nnoble struggle, is a circumstance for which I will not try to account. I\nwill only say--and it is a hint which SOME PERSONS will understand--that\nthere are other forms of jealousy than those which spring from love.\n\nIt is, indeed, incredible that so little is known, outside the State of\nAtlantic, of the experiment--I mean the achievement--of the last eight\nyears. While the war lasted, we did not complain that our work was\nignored; but now that our sisters in other States are acting as if in\ncomplete unconsciousness of what WE have done--now that we need their\naid and they need ours (but in different ways), it is time that somebody\nshould speak. Were Selina Whiston living, I should leave the task to\nher pen; she never recovered from the shock and mortification of her\nexperiences in the State Legislature, in '64--but I will not anticipate\nthe history. Of all the band of female iconoclasts, as the Hon. Mr.\nScreed called us in jest--it was no jest afterwards, HIS image being the\nfirst to go down--of all, I say, “some are married, and some are dead,”\n and there is really no one left so familiar with the circumstances as I\nam, and equally competent to give a report of them.\n\nMr. Spelter (the editor of the “Burroak Banner”) suggests that I must\nbe brief, if I wish my words to reach the ears of the millions for\nwhom they are designed; and I shall do my best to be so. If I were not\nobliged to begin at the very beginning, and if the interests of Atlantic\nhad not been swallowed up, like those of other little States, in the\nwhirlpool of national politics, I should have much less to say. But if\nMr. George Fenian Brain and Mrs. Candy Station do not choose to inform\nthe public of either the course or the results of our struggle, am I to\nblame? If I could have attended the convention in Boston, and had been\nallowed to speak--and I am sure the distinguished Chairwoman would have\ngiven me a chance--it would have been the best way, no doubt, to set our\ncase before the world.\n\nI must first tell you how it was that we succeeded in forcing the men to\naccept our claims, so much in advance of other States. We were indebted\nfor it chiefly to the skill and adroitness of Selina Whiston. The matter\nhad been agitated, it is true, for some years before, and as early as\n1856, a bill, drawn up by Mrs. Whiston herself, had been introduced into\nthe Legislature, where it received three votes. Moreover, we had held\nmeetings in almost every election precinct in the State, and our Annual\nFair (to raise funds) at Gaston, while the Legislature was in session,\nwas always very brilliant and successful. So the people were not\nentirely unprepared.\n\nAlthough our State had gone for Fremont in 1856, by a small majority,\nthe Democrats afterwards elected their Governor; and both parties,\ntherefore, had hopes of success in 1860. The canvass began early, and\nwas very animated. Mrs. Whiston had already inaugurated the custom of\nattending political meetings, and occasionally putting a question to the\nstump orator--no matter of which party; of sometimes, indeed, taking the\nstump herself, after the others had exhausted their wind. She was very\nwitty, as you know, and her stories were so good and so capitally told,\nthat neither Democrat nor Republican thought of leaving the ground while\nshe was upon the stand.\n\nNow, it happened that our Congressional District was one of the closest.\nIt happened, also, that our candidate (I am a Republican, and so is Mr.\nStrongitharm) was rather favorably inclined to the woman's cause. It\nhappened, thirdly--and this is the seemingly insignificant pivot upon\nwhich we whirled into triumph--that he, Mr. Wrangle, and the opposing\ncandidate, Mr. Tumbrill, had arranged to hold a joint meeting at\nBurroak. This meeting took place on a magnificent day, just after the\noats-harvest; and everybody, for twenty miles around, was there. Mrs.\nWhiston, together with Sarah Pincher, Olympia Knapp, and several other\nprominent advocates of our cause, met at my house in the morning; and\nwe all agreed that it was time to strike a blow. The rest of us\nmagnanimously decided to take no part in the concerted plan, though very\neager to do so. Selina Whiston declared that she must have the field to\nherself; and when she said that, we knew she meant it.\n\nIt was generally known that she was on the ground. In fact, she spent\nmost of the time while Messrs. Wrangle and Tumbrill were speaking,\nin walking about through the crowds--so after an hour apiece for the\ngentlemen, and then fifteen minutes apiece for a rejoinder, and the\nStar Spangled Banner from the band, for both sides, we were not a\nbit surprised to hear a few cries of “Whiston!” from the audience.\nImmediately we saw the compact gray bonnet and brown serge dress (she\nknew what would go through a crowd without tearing!) splitting the wedge\nof people on the steps leading to the platform. I noticed that the two\nCongressional candidates looked at each other and smiled, in spite of\nthe venomous charges they had just been making.\n\nWell--I won't attempt to report her speech, though it was her most\nsplendid effort (as people WILL say, when it was no effort to her at\nall). But the substance of it was this: after setting forth woman's\nwrongs and man's tyranny, and taxation without representation, and an\nequal chance, and fair-play, and a struggle for life (which you know all\nabout from the other conventions), she turned squarely around to the two\ncandidates and said:\n\n“Now to the practical application. You, Mr. Wrangle, and you, Mr.\nTumbrill, want to be elected to Congress. The district is a close one:\nyou have both counted the votes in advance (oh, I know your secrets!)\nand there isn't a difference of a hundred in your estimates. A\nvery little will turn the scale either way. Perhaps a woman's\ninfluence--perhaps my voice--might do it. But I will give you an equal\nchance. So much power is left to woman, despite what you withhold, that\nwe, the women of Putnam, Shinnebaug, and Rancocus counties, are able to\ndecide which of you shall be elected. Either of you would give a great\ndeal to have a majority of the intelligent women of the District on your\nside: it would already be equivalent to success. Now, to show that we\nunderstand the political business from which you have excluded us--to\nprove that we are capable of imitating the noble example of MEN--we\noffer to sell our influence, as they their votes, to the highest\nbidder!”\n\nThere was great shouting and cheering among the people at this, but the\ntwo candidates, somehow or other, didn't seem much amused.\n\n“I stand here,” she continued, “in the interest of my struggling\nsisters, and with authority to act for them. Which of you will bid\nthe most--not in offices or material advantages, as is the way of your\nparties, but in the way of help to the Woman's Cause? Which of you\nwill here publicly pledge himself to say a word for us, from now until\nelection-day, whenever he appears upon the stump?”\n\nThere was repeated cheering, and cries of “Got 'em there!” (Men are so\nvulgar).\n\n“I pause for a reply. Shall they not answer me?” she continued, turning\nto the audience.\n\nThen there were tremendous cries of “Yes! yes! Wrangle! Tumbrill!”\n\nMr. Wrangle looked at Mr. Tumbrill, and made a motion with his head,\nsignifying that he should speak. Then Mr. Tumbrill looked at Mr.\nWrangle, and made a motion that HE should speak. The people saw all\nthis, and laughed and shouted as if they would never finish.\n\nMr. Wrangle, on second thoughts (this is my private surmise), saw that\nboldness would just then be popular; so he stepped forward.\n\n“Do I understand,” he said, “that my fair and eloquent friend demands\nperfect political and civil equality for her sex?”\n\n“I do!” exclaimed Selina Whiston, in her firmest manner.\n\n“Let me be more explicit,” he continued. “You mean precisely the\nsame rights, the same duties, the same obligations, the same\nresponsibilities?”\n\nShe repeated the phrases over after him, affirmatively, with an emphasis\nwhich I never heard surpassed.\n\n“Pardon me once more,” said Mr. Wrangle; “the right to vote, to hold\noffice, to practise law, theology, medicine, to take part in all\nmunicipal affairs, to sit on juries, to be called upon to aid in the\nexecution of the law, to aid in suppressing disturbances, enforcing\npublic order, and performing military duty?”\n\nHere there were loud cheers from the audience; and a good many voices\ncried out: “Got her there!” (Men are so very vulgar.)\n\nMrs. Whiston looked troubled for a moment, but she saw that a moment's\nhesitation would be fatal to our scheme, so she brought out her words as\nif each one were a maul-blow on the butt-end of a wedge:\n\n“All--that--we--demand!”\n\n“Then,” said Mr. Wrangle, “I bid my support in exchange for the women's!\nJust what the speaker demands, without exception or modification--equal\nprivileges, rights, duties and obligations, without regard to the\nquestion of sex! Is that broad enough?”\n\nI was all in a tremble when it came to that. Somehow Mr. Wrangle's\nacceptance of the bid did not inspire me, although it promised so much.\nI had anticipated opposition, dissatisfaction, tumult. So had Mrs.\nWhiston, and I could see, and the crowd could see, that she was not\ngreatly elated.\n\nMr. Wrangle made a very significant bow to Mr. Tumbrill, and then sat\ndown. There were cries of “Tumbrill!” and that gentleman--none of us,\nof course, believing him sincere, for we knew his private views--came\nforward and made exactly the same pledge. I will do both parties\nthe justice to say that they faithfully kept their word; nay, it was\ngenerally thought the repetition of their brief pleas for woman, at some\nfifty meetings before election came, had gradually conducted them to\nthe belief that they were expressing their own personal sentiments. The\nmechanical echo in public thus developed into an opinion in private.\nMy own political experience has since demonstrated to me that this is a\nphenomenon very common among men.\n\nThe impulse generated at that meeting gradually spread all over the\nState. We--the leaders of the Women's Movement--did not rest until we\nhad exacted the same pledge from all the candidates of both parties; and\nthe nearer it drew towards election-day, the more prominence was given,\nin the public meetings, to the illustration and discussion of the\nsubject. Our State went for Lincoln by a majority of 2763 (as you will\nfind by consulting the “Tribune Almanac”), and Mr. Wrangle was elected\nto Congress, having received a hundred and forty-two more votes than his\nopponent. Mr. Tumbrill has always attributed his defeat to his want of\ncourage in not taking up at once the glove which Selina Whiston threw\ndown.\n\nI think I have said enough to make it clear how the State of Atlantic\ncame to be the first to grant equal civil and political rights to women.\nWhen the Legislature of 1860-'61 met at Gaston, we estimated that we\nmight count upon fifty-three out of the seventy-one Republican Senators\nand Assemblymen, and on thirty-four out of the sixty-five Democrats.\nThis would give a majority of twenty-eight in the House, and ten in\nthe Senate. Should the bill pass, there was still a possibility that\nit might be vetoed by the Governor, of whom we did not feel sure. We\ntherefore arranged that our Annual Fair should be held a fortnight later\nthan usual, and that the proceeds (a circumstance known only to the\nmanagers) should be devoted to a series of choice suppers, at which we\nentertained, not only the Governor and our friends in both Houses, but\nalso, like true Christians, our legislatorial enemies. Olympia Knapp,\nwho, you know, is so very beautiful, presided at these entertainments.\nShe put forth all her splendid powers, and with more effect than any of\nus suspected. On the day before the bill reached its third reading,\nthe Governor made her an offer of marriage. She came to the managers in\ngreat agitation, and laid the matter before them, stating that she was\noverwhelmed with surprise (though Sarah Pincher always maintained that\nshe wasn't in the least), and asking their advice. We discussed the\nquestion for four hours, and finally decided that the interests of\nthe cause would oblige her to accept the Governor's hand. “Oh, I am so\nglad!” cried Olympia, “for I accepted him at once.” It was a brave, a\nnoble deed!\n\nNow, I would ask those who assert that women are incapable of conducting\nthe business of politics, to say whether any set of men, of either\nparty, could have played their cards more skilfully? Even after the\ncampaign was over we might have failed, had it not been for the suppers.\nWe owed this idea, like the first, to the immortal Selina Whiston.\nA lucky accident--as momentous in its way as the fall of an apple to\nNewton, or the flying of a kite to Dr. Franklin--gave her the secret\nprinciple by which the politics of men are directed. Her house in\nWhittletown was the half of a double frame building, and the rear-end of\nthe other part was the private office of--but no, I will not mention the\nname--a lawyer and a politician. He was known as a “wirepuller,” and the\nother wire-pullers of his party used to meet in his office and discuss\nmatters. Mrs. Whiston always asserted that there was a mouse-hole\nthrough the partition; but she had energy enough to have made a hole\nherself, for the sake of the cause.\n\nShe never would tell us all she overheard. “It is enough,” she would\nsay, “that I know how the thing is done.”\n\nI remember that we were all considerably startled when she first gave us\nan outline of her plan. On my saying that I trusted the dissemination of\nour principles would soon bring us a great adhesion, she burst out with:\n\n“Principles! Why if we trust to principles, we shall never succeed! We\nmust rely upon INFLUENCES, as the men do; we must fight them with their\nown weapons, and even then we are at a disadvantage, because we cannot\nvery well make use of whiskey and cigars.”\n\nWe yielded, because we had grown accustomed to be guided by her; and,\nmoreover, we had seen, time and again, how she could succeed--as, for\ninstance, in the Nelson divorce case (but I don't suppose you ever heard\nof that), when the matter seemed nigh hopeless to all of us. The history\nof 1860 and the following winter proves that in her the world has lost\na stateswoman. Mr. Wrangle and Governor Battle have both said to me that\nthey never knew a measure to be so splendidly engineered both before the\npublic and in the State Legislature.\n\nAfter the bill had been passed, and signed by the Governor, and so had\nbecome a law, and the grand Women's Jubilee had been held at Gaston,\nthe excitement subsided. It would be nearly a year to the next State\nelection, and none of the women seemed to care for the local and\nmunicipal elections in the spring. Besides, there was a good deal of\nanxiety among them in regard to the bill, which was drawn up in almost\nthe exact terms used by Mr. Wrangle at the political meeting. In fact,\nwe always have suspected that he wrote it. The word “male” was simply\nomitted from all laws. “Nothing is changed,” said Mrs. Whiston, quoting\nCharles X., “there are only 201,758 more citizens in Atlantic!”\n\nThis was in January, 1861, you must remember; and the shadow of the\ncoming war began to fall over us. Had the passage of our bill been\npostponed a fortnight it would have been postponed indefinitely, for\nother and (for the men) more powerful excitements followed one upon\nthe other. Even our jubilee was thinly attended, and all but two of the\nmembers on whom we relied for speeches failed us. Governor Battle, who\nwas to have presided, was at Washington, and Olympia, already his wife,\naccompanied him. (I may add that she has never since taken any active\npart with us. They have been in Europe for the last three years.)\n\nMost of the women--here in Burroak, at least--expressed a feeling of\ndisappointment that there was no palpable change in their lot, no sense\nof extended liberty, such as they imagined would come to transform them\ninto brighter and better creatures. They supposed that they would at\nonce gain in importance in the eyes of the men; but the men were now\nso preoccupied by the events at the South that they seemed to have\nforgotten our political value. Speaking for myself, as a good Union\nwoman, I felt that I must lay aside, for a time, the interests of my\nsex. Once, it is true, I proposed to accompany Mr. Strongitharm to a\nparty caucus at the Wrangle House; but he so suddenly discovered that\nhe had business in another part of the town, that I withdrew my\nproposition.\n\nAs the summer passed over, and the first and second call for volunteers\nhad been met, and more than met, by the patriotic men of the State (how\nwe blessed them!) we began to take courage, and to feel, that if our\nnew civil position brought us no very tangible enjoyment, at least it\nimposed upon us no very irksome duties.\n\nThe first practical effect of the new law came to light at the August\nterm of our County Court. The names of seven women appeared on the list\nof jurors, but only three of them answered to their names. One, the wife\nof a poor farmer, was excused by the Judge, as there was no one to look\nafter six small children in her absence; another was a tailoress, with\na quantity of work on hand, some of which she proposed bringing with her\ninto Court, in order to save time; but as this could not be allowed,\nshe made so much trouble that she was also finally let off. Only one,\ntherefore, remained to serve; fortunately for the credit of our sex,\nshe was both able and willing to do so; and we afterward made a\nsubscription, and presented her with a silver fish-knife, on account of\nher having tired out eleven jurymen, and brought in a verdict of $5,000\ndamages against a young man whom she convicted of seduction. She told\nme that no one would ever know what she endured during those three days;\nbut the morals of our county have been better ever since.\n\nMr. Spelter told me that his State exchanges showed that there had been\ndifficulties of the same kind in all the other counties. In Mendip (the\ncounty-town of which is Whittletown, Mrs. Whiston's home) the immediate\nresult had been the decision, on the part of the Commissioners, to build\nan addition at the rear of the Court-House, with large, commodious and\nwell-furnished jury-rooms, so arranged that a comfortable privacy was\nsecured to the jury-women. I did my best to have the same improvement\nadopted here, but, alas! I have not the ability of Selina Whiston\nin such matters, and there is nothing to this day but the one vile,\nmiserable room, properly furnished in no particular except spittoons.\n\nThe nominating Conventions were held in August, also, and we were\ntherefore called upon to move at once, in order to secure our fair\nshare. Much valuable time had been lost in discussing a question of\npolicy, namely, whether we should attach ourselves to the two parties\nalready in existence, according to our individual inclinations, or\nwhether we should form a third party for ourselves. We finally accepted\nthe former proposition, and I think wisely; for the most of us were so\nignorant of political tricks and devices, that we still needed to learn\nfrom the men, and we could not afford to draw upon us the hostility of\nboth parties, in the very infancy of our movement.\n\nNever in my life did I have such a task, as in drumming up a few women\nto attend the primary township meeting for the election of delegates. It\nwas impossible to make them comprehend its importance. Even after I had\ndone my best to explain the technicalities of male politics, and fancied\nthat I had made some impression, the answer would be: “Well, I'd go,\nI'm sure, just to oblige you, but then there's the tomatoes to be\ncanned”--or, “I'm so behindhand with my darning and patching”--or,\n“John'll be sure to go, and there's no need of two from the same\nhouse”--and so on, until I was mightily discouraged. There were just\nnine of us, all told, to about a hundred men. I won't deny that our\nsituation that night, at the Wrangle House, was awkward and not entirely\nagreeable. To be sure the landlord gave us the parlor, and most of\nthe men came in, now and then, to speak to us; but they managed the\nprincipal matters all by themselves, in the bar-room, which was such a\nmess of smoke and stale liquor smells, that it turned my stomach when I\nventured in for two minutes.\n\nI don't think we should have accomplished much, but for a 'cute idea of\nMrs. Wilbur, the tinman's wife. She went to the leaders, and threatened\nthem that the women's vote should be cast in a body for the Democratic\ncandidates, unless we were considered in making up the ticket.\nTHAT helped: the delegates were properly instructed, and the County\nConvention afterward nominated two men and one woman as candidates for\nthe Assembly. That woman was--as I need hardly say, for the world knows\nit--myself. I had not solicited the honor, and therefore could not\nrefuse, especially as my daughter Melissa was then old enough to\nkeep house in my absence. No woman had applied for the nomination for\nSheriff, but there were seventeen schoolmistresses anxious for the\noffice of County Treasurer. The only other nomination given to the\nwomen, however, was that of Director (or rather, Directress) of the\nPoor, which was conferred on Mrs. Bassett, wife of a clergyman.\n\nMr. Strongitharm insisted that I should, in some wise, prepare\nmyself for my new duties, by reading various political works, and I\nconscientiously tried to do so--but, dear me! it was much more of a task\nthan I supposed. We had all read the debate on our bill, of course; but\nI always skipped the dry, stupid stuff about the tariff, and finance,\nand stay laws and exemption laws, and railroad company squabbles; and\nfor the life of me I can't see, to this day, what connection there is\nbetween these things and Women's Rights. But, as I said, I did my best,\nwith the help of Webster's Dictionary; although the further I went the\nless I liked it.\n\nAs election-day drew nearer, our prospects looked brighter. The\nRepublican ticket, under the editorial head of the “Burroak Banner,”\n with my name and Mrs. Bassett's among the men's, was such an evidence,\nthat many women, notably opposed to the cause, said: “We didn't want the\nright, but since we have it, we shall make use of it.” This was exactly\nwhat Mrs. Whiston had foretold. We estimated that--taking the\nCounty tickets all over the State--we had about one-twentieth of the\nRepublican, and one-fiftieth of the Democratic, nominations. This was\nfar from being our due, but still it was a good beginning.\n\nMy husband insisted that I should go very early to the polls. I could\nscarcely restrain a tear of emotion as I gave my first ballot into the\nhands of the judges. There were not a dozen persons present, and the\nact did not produce the sensation which I expected. One man cried\nout: “Three cheers for our Assemblywoman!” and they gave them; and I\nthereupon returned home in the best spirits. I devoted the rest of the\nday to relieving poorer women, who could not have spared the time to\nvote, if I had not, meanwhile, looked after their children. The last\nwas Nancy Black, the shoemaker's wife in our street, who kept me waiting\nupon her till it was quite dark. When she finally came, the skirt of her\ndress was ripped nearly off, her hair was down and her comb broken; but\nshe was triumphant, for Sam Black was with her, and SOBER. “The first\ntime since we were married, Mrs. Strongitharm!” she cried. Then she\nwhispered to me, as I was leaving: “And I've killed HIS vote, anyhow!”\n\nWhen the count was made, our party was far ahead. Up to this time, I\nthink, the men of both parties had believed that only a few women, here\nand there, would avail themselves of their new right--but they were\nroundly mistaken. Although only ten per cent. of the female voters went\nto the polls, yet three-fourths of them voted the Republican ticket,\nwhich increased the majority of that party, in the State, about eleven\nthousand.\n\nIt was amazing what an effect followed this result. The whole country\nwould have rung with it, had we not been in the midst of war. Mr.\nWrangle declared that he had always been an earnest advocate of the\nwomen's cause. Governor Battle, in his next message, congratulated\nthe State on the signal success of the experiment, and the Democratic\nmasses, smarting under their defeat, cursed their leaders for not having\nbeen sharp enough to conciliate the new element. The leaders themselves\nsaid nothing, and in a few weeks the rank and file recovered their\ncheerfulness. Even Mrs. Whiston, with all her experience, was a little\npuzzled by this change of mood. Alas! she was far from guessing the\ncorrect explanation.\n\nIt was a great comfort to me that Mrs. Whiston was also elected to the\nLegislature. My husband had just then established his manufactory of\npatent self-scouring knife-blades (now so celebrated), and could not\nleave; so I was obliged to go up to Gaston all alone, when the session\ncommenced. There were but four of us Assemblywomen, and although the\nmen treated us with great courtesy, I was that nervous that I seemed\nto detect either commiseration or satire everywhere. Before I had even\ntaken my seat, I was addressed by fifteen or twenty different gentlemen,\neither great capitalists, or great engineers, or distinguished lawyers,\nall interested in various schemes for developing the resources of our\nState by new railroads, canals or ferries. I then began to comprehend\nthe grandeur of the Legislator's office. My voice could assist in making\npossible these magnificent improvements, and I promised it to all. Mr.\nFilch, President of the Shinnebaug and Great Western Consolidated Line,\nwas so delighted with my appreciation of his plan for reducing the\nfreight on grain from Nebraska, that he must have written extravagant\naccounts of me to his wife; for she sent me, at Christmas, one of the\nloveliest shawls I ever beheld.\n\nI had frequently made short addresses at our public meetings, and\nwas considered to have my share of self-possession; but I never could\naccustom myself to the keen, disturbing, irritating atmosphere of the\nLegislature. Everybody seemed wide-awake and aggressive, instead of\npleasantly receptive; there were so many “points of order,” and what\nnot; such complete disregard, among the members, of each other's\nfeelings; and, finally--a thing I could never understand, indeed--such\ninconsistency and lack of principle in the intercourse of the two\nparties. How could I feel assured of their sincerity, when I saw the\nvery men chatting and laughing together, in the lobbies, ten minutes\nafter they had been facing each other like angry lions in the debate?\n\nMrs. Whiston, also, had her trials of the same character. Nothing ever\nannoyed her so much as a little blunder she made, the week after the\nopening of the session. I have not yet mentioned that there was already\na universal dissatisfaction among the women, on account of their being\nliable to military service. The war seemed to have hardly begun, as\nyet, and conscription was already talked about; the women, therefore,\nclamored for an exemption on account of sex. Although we all felt\nthat this was a retrograde movement, the pressure was so great that we\nyielded. Mrs. Whiston, reluctant at first, no sooner made up her mind\nthat the thing must be done, than she furthered it with all her might.\nAfter several attempts to introduce a bill, which were always cut off by\nsome “point of order,” she unhappily lost her usual patience.\n\nI don't know that I can exactly explain how it happened, for what\nthe men call “parliamentary tactics” always made me fidgetty. But the\n“previous question” turned up (as it always seemed to me to do, at the\nwrong time), and cut her off before she had spoken ten words.\n\n“Mr. Speaker!” she protested; “there is no question, previous to this,\nwhich needs the consideration of the house! This is first in importance,\nand demands your immediate--”\n\n“Order! order!” came from all parts of the house.\n\n“I am in order--the right is always in order!” she exclaimed, getting\nmore and more excited. “We women are not going to be contented with the\nmere show of our rights on this floor; we demand the substance--”\n\nAnd so she was going on, when there arose the most fearful tumult.\nThe upshot of it was, that the speaker ordered the sergeant-at-arms to\nremove Mrs. Whiston; one of the members, more considerate, walked across\nthe floor to her, and tried to explain in what manner she was violating\nthe rules; and in another minute she sat down, so white, rigid and\nsilent that it made me shake in my shoes to look at her.\n\n“I have made a great blunder,” she said to me, that evening; “and it may\nset us back a little; but I shall recover my ground.” Which she did,\nI assure you. She cultivated the acquaintance of the leaders of\nboth parties, studied their tactics, and quietly waited for a good\nopportunity to bring in her bill. At first, we thought it would pass;\nbut one of the male members presently came out with a speech, which\ndashed our hopes to nothing. He simply took the ground that there must\nbe absolute equality in citizenship; that every privilege was balanced\nby a duty, every trust accompanied with its responsibility. He had no\nobjection to women possessing equal rights with men--but to give them\nall civil rights and exempt them from the most important obligation\nof service, would be, he said, to create a privileged class--a female\naristocracy. It was contrary to the spirit of our institutions. The\nwomen had complained of taxation without representation; did they now\nclaim the latter without the former?\n\nThe people never look more than half-way into a subject, and so this\nspeech was immensely popular. I will not give Mrs. Whiston's admirable\nreply; for Mr. Spelter informs me that you will not accept an article,\nif it should make more than seventy or eighty printed pages. It is\nenough that our bill was “killed,” as the men say (a brutal word); and\nthe women of the State laid the blame of the failure upon us. You may\nimagine that we suffered under this injustice; but worse was to come.\n\nAs I said before, a great many things came up in the Legislature which I\ndid not understand--and, to be candid, did not care to understand. But\nI was obliged to vote, nevertheless, and in this extremity I depended\npretty much on Mrs. Whiston's counsel. We could not well go to the\nprivate nightly confabs of the members--indeed, they did not invite us;\nand when it came to the issue of State bonds, bank charters, and such\nlike, I felt as if I were blundering along in the dark.\n\nOne day, I received, to my immense astonishment, a hundred and more\nletters, all from the northern part of our county. I opened them, one\nafter the other, and--well, it is beyond my power to tell you what\nvarieties of indignation and abuse fell upon me. It seems that I had\nvoted against the bill to charter the Mendip Extension Railroad Co.\nI had been obliged to vote for or against so many things, that it\nwas impossible to recollect them all. However, I procured the printed\njournal, and, sure enough! there, among the nays, was “Strongitharm.”\n It was not a week after that--and I was still suffering in mind and\nbody--when the newspapers in the interest of the Rancocus and Great\nWestern Consolidated accused me (not by name, but the same thing--you\nknow how they do it) of being guilty of taking bribes. Mr. Filch, of the\nShinnebaug Consolidated had explained to me so beautifully the superior\nadvantages of his line, that the Directors of the other company took\ntheir revenge in this vile, abominable way.\n\nThat was only the beginning of my trouble. What with these slanders\nand longing for the quiet of our dear old home at Burroak, I was\nalmost sick; yet the Legislature sat on, and sat on, until I was nearly\ndesperate. Then one morning came a despatch from my husband: “Melissa\nis drafted--come home!” How I made the journey I can't tell; I was in an\nagony of apprehension, and when Mr. Strongitharm and Melissa both met me\nat the Burroak Station, well and smiling, I fell into a hysterical fit\nof laughing and crying, for the first time in my life.\n\nBilly Brandon, who was engaged to Melissa, came forward and took her\nplace like a man; he fought none the worse, let me tell you, because\nhe represented a woman, and (I may as well say it now) he came home a\nCaptain, without a left arm--but Melissa seems to have three arms for\nhis sake.\n\nYou have no idea what a confusion and lamentation there was all over the\nState. A good many women were drafted, and those who could neither\nget substitutes for love nor money, were marched to Gaston, where the\nrecruiting Colonel was considerate enough to give them a separate\ncamp. In a week, however, the word came from Washington that the Army\nRegulations of the United States did not admit of their being received;\nand they came home blessing Mr. Stanton. This was the end of drafting\nwomen in our State.\n\nNevertheless, the excitement created by the draft did not subside at\nonce. It was seized upon by the Democratic leaders, as part of a plan\nalready concocted, which they then proceeded to set in operation. It\nsucceeded only too well, and I don't know when we shall ever see the end\nof it.\n\nWe had more friends among the Republicans at the start, because all the\noriginal Abolitionists in the State came into that party in 1860. Our\nsuccess had been so rapid and unforeseen that the Democrats continued\ntheir opposition even after female suffrage was an accomplished fact;\nbut the leaders were shrewd enough to see that another such election\nas the last would ruin their party in the State. So their trains were\nquietly laid, and the match was not applied until all Atlantic was\nringing with the protestations of the unwilling conscripts and the\nlaments of their families. Then came, like three claps of thunder\nin one, sympathy for the women, acquiescence in their rights, and\ninvitations to them, everywhere, to take part in the Democratic caucuses\nand conventions. Most of the prominent women of the State were deluded\nfor a time by this manifestation, and acted with the party for the sake\nof the sex.\n\nI had no idea, however, what the practical result of this movement\nwould be, until, a few weeks before election, I was calling upon Mrs.\nBuckwalter, and happened to express my belief that we Republicans were\ngoing to carry the State again, by a large majority.\n\n“I am very glad of it,” said she, with an expression of great relief,\n“because then my vote will not be needed.”\n\n“Why!” I exclaimed; “you won't decline to vote, surely?”\n\n“Worse than that,” she answered, “I am afraid I shall have to vote with\nthe other side.”\n\nNow as I knew her to be a good Republican, I could scarcely believe my\nears. She blushed, I must admit, when she saw my astonished face.\n\n“I'm so used to Bridget, you know,” she continued, “and good girls are\nso very hard to find, nowadays. She has as good as said that she won't\nstay a day later than election, if I don't vote for HER candidate; and\nwhat am I to do?”\n\n“Do without!” I said shortly, getting up in my indignation.\n\n“Yes, that's very well for you, with your wonderful PHYSIQUE,” said Mrs.\nBuckwalter, quietly, “but think of me with my neuralgia, and the pain in\nmy back! It would be a dreadful blow, if I should lose Bridget.”\n\nWell--what with torch-light processions, and meetings on both sides,\nBurroak was in such a state of excitement when election came, that most\nof the ladies of my acquaintance were almost afraid to go to the polls.\nI tried to get them out during the first hours after sunrise, when I\nwent myself, but in vain. Even that early, I heard things that made\nme shudder. Those who came later, went home resolved to give up their\nrights rather than undergo a second experience of rowdyism. But it was\na jubilee for the servant girls. Mrs. Buckwalter didn't gain much by her\napostasy, for Bridget came home singing “The Wearing of the Green,” and\nlet fall a whole tray full of the best china before she could be got to\nbed.\n\nBurroak, which, the year before, had a Republican majority of three\nhundred, now went for the Democrats by more than five hundred. The\nsame party carried the State, electing their Governor by near twenty\nthousand. The Republicans would now have gladly repealed the bill giving\nus equal rights, but they were in a minority, and the Democrats refused\nto co-operate. Mrs. Whiston, who still remained loyal to our side,\ncollected information from all parts of the State, from which it\nappeared that four-fifths of all the female citizens had voted the\nDemocratic ticket. In New Lisbon, our great manufacturing city, with\nits population of nearly one hundred thousand, the party gained three\nthousand votes, while the accessions to the Republican ranks were only\nabout four hundred.\n\nMrs. Whiston barely escaped being defeated; her majority was reduced\nfrom seven hundred to forty-three. Eleven Democratic Assemblywomen and\nfour Senatoresses were chosen, however, so that she had the consolation\nof knowing that her sex had gained, although her party had lost. She was\nstill in good spirits: “It will all right itself in time,” she said.\n\nYou will readily guess, after what I have related, that I was not only\nnot re-elected to the Legislature, but that I was not even a candidate.\nI could have born the outrageous attacks of the opposite party; but the\ntreatment I had received from my own “constituents” (I shall always hate\nthe word) gave me a new revelation of the actual character of political\nlife. I have not mentioned half the worries and annoyances to which I\nwas subjected--the endless, endless letters and applications for office,\nor for my influence in some way--the abuse and threats when I could\nnot possibly do what was desired--the exhibitions of selfishness and\ndisregard of all great and noble principles--and finally, the shameless\nadvances which were made by what men call “the lobby,” to secure my vote\nfor this, that, and the other thing.\n\nWhy, it fairly made my hair stand on end to hear the stories which the\npleasant men, whom I thought so grandly interested in schemes for\n“the material development of the country,” told about each other. Mrs.\nFilch's shawl began to burn my shoulders before I had worn it a half a\ndozen times. (I have since given it to Melissa, as a wedding-present).\n\nBefore the next session was half over, I was doubly glad of being safe\nat home. Mrs. Whiston supposed that the increased female representation\nwould give her more support, and indeed it seemed so, at first. But\nafter her speech on the Bounty bill, only two of the fifteen Democratic\nwomen would even speak to her, and all hope of concord of action in\nthe interests of women was at an end. We read the debates, and my blood\nfairly boiled when I found what taunts and sneers, and epithets she was\nforced to endure. I wondered how she could sit still under them.\n\nTo make her position worse, the adjoining seat was occupied by an\nIrishwoman, who had been elected by the votes of the laborers on the\nnew Albemarle Extension, in the neighborhood of which she kept a grocery\nstore. Nelly Kirkpatrick was a great, red-haired giant of a woman, very\nilliterate, but with some native wit, and good-hearted enough, I am\ntold, when she was in her right mind. She always followed the lead of\nMr. Gorham (whose name, you see, came before hers in the call), and\na look from him was generally sufficient to quiet her when she was\ninclined to be noisy.\n\nWhen the resolutions declaring the war a failure were introduced, the\nparty excitement ran higher than ever. The “lunch-room” (as they called\nit--I never went there but once, the title having deceived me) in the\nbasement-story of the State House was crowded during the discussion, and\nevery time Nelly Kirkpatrick came up, her face was a shade deeper red.\nMr. Gorham's nods and winks were of no avail--speak she would, and speak\nshe did, not so very incoherently, after all, but very abusively. To\nbe sure, you would never have guessed it, if you had read the quiet and\ndignified report in the papers on her side, the next day.\n\nTHEN Mrs. Whiston's patience broke down. “Mr. Speaker,” she exclaimed,\nstarting to her feet, “I protest against this House being compelled\nto listen to such a tirade as has just been delivered. Are we to be\ndisgraced before the world--”\n\n“Oh, hoo! Disgraced, is it?” yelled Nelly Kirkpatrick, violently\ninterrupting her, “and me as dacent a woman as ever she was, or ever\nwill be! Disgraced, hey? Oh, I'll larn her what it is to blaggard her\nbetters!”\n\nAnd before anybody could imagine what was coming, she pounced upon Mrs.\nWhiston, with one jerk ripped off her skirt (it was silk, not serge,\nthis time), seized her by the hair, and gave her head such a twist\nbackwards, that the chignon not only came off in her hands, but as her\nvictim opened her mouth too widely in the struggle, the springs of her\nfalse teeth were sprung the wrong way, and the entire set flew out and\nrattled upon the floor.\n\nOf course there were cries of “Order! Order!” and the nearest\nmembers--Mr. Gorham among the first--rushed in; but the mischief was\ndone. Mrs. Whiston had always urged upon our minds the necessity of\nnot only being dressed according to the popular fashion, but also as\nelegantly and becomingly as possible. “If we adopt the Bloomers,” she\nsaid, “we shall never get our rights, while the world stands. Where it\nis necessary to influence men, we must be wholly and truly WOMEN, not\nsemi-sexed nondescripts; we must employ every charm Nature gives us and\nFashion adds, not hide them under a forked extinguisher!” I give her\nvery words to show you her way of looking at things. Well, now imagine\nthis elegant woman, looking not a day over forty, though she was--but\nno, I have no right to tell it,--imagine her, I say, with only her\nscanty natural hair hanging over her ears, her mouth dreadfully fallen\nin, her skirt torn off, all in open day, before the eyes of a hundred\nand fifty members (and I am told they laughed immensely, in spite of the\nscandal that it was), and, if you are human beings, you will feel that\nshe must have been wounded to the very heart.\n\nThere was a motion made to expel Nelly Kirkpatrick, and perhaps it\nmight have succeeded--but the railroad hands, all over the State, made a\nheroine of her, and her party was afraid of losing five or six thousand\nvotes; so only a mild censure was pronounced. But there was no end\nto the caricatures, and songs, and all sorts of ribaldry, about the\noccurrence; and even our party said that, although Mrs. Whiston was\nreally and truly a martyr, yet the circumstance was an immense damage\nto THEM. When she heard THAT, I believe it killed her. She resigned her\nseat, went home, never appeared again in public, and died within a year.\n“My dear friend,” she wrote to me, not a month before her death, “I have\nbeen trying all my life to get a thorough knowledge of the masculine\nnature, but my woman's plummet will not reach to the bottom of that\nchaotic pit of selfishness and principle, expedience and firmness\nfor the right, brutality and tenderness, gullibility and devilish\nshrewdness, which I have tried to sound. Only one thing is clear--we\nwomen cannot do without what we have sometimes, alas! sneered at as THE\nCHIVELRY OF THE SEX. The question of our rights is as clear to me as\never; but we must find a plan to get them without being forced to share,\nor even to SEE, all that men do in their political lives. We have\nonly beheld some Principle riding aloft, not the mud through which her\nchariot wheels are dragged. The ways must be swept before we can walk in\nthem--but how and by whom shall this be done?”\n\nFor my part, _I_ can't say, and I wish somebody would tell me.\n\nWell--after seeing our State, which we used to be proud of, delivered\nover for two years to the control of a party whose policy was so\nrepugnant to all our feelings of loyalty, we endeavored to procure, at\nleast a qualification of intelligence for voters. Of course, we didn't\nget it: the exclusion from suffrage of all who were unable to read and\nwrite might have turned the scales again, and given us the State. After\nour boys came back from the war, we might have succeeded--but their\nvotes were over-balanced by those of the servant-girls, every one of\nwhom turned out, making a whole holiday of the election.\n\nI thought, last fall, that my Maria, who is German, would have voted\nwith us. I stayed at home and did the work myself, on purpose that she\nmight hear the oration of Carl Schurz; but old Hammer, who keeps the\nlager-beer saloon in the upper end of Burroak, gave a supper and a\ndance to all the German girls and their beaux, after the meeting, and\nso managed to secure nine out of ten of their votes for Seymour. Maria\nproposed going away a week before election, up into Decatur County,\nwhere, she said, some relations, just arrived from Bavaria, had settled.\nI was obliged to let her go, or lose her altogether, but I was comforted\nby the thought that if her vote were lost for Grant, at least it could\nnot be given to Seymour. After the election was over, and Decatur\nCounty, which we had always managed to carry hitherto, went against\nus, the whole matter was explained. About five hundred girls, we were\ninformed, had been COLONIZED in private families, as extra help, for a\nfortnight, and of course Maria was one of them. (I have looked at\nthe addresses of her letters, ever since, and not one has she sent\nto Decatur). A committee has been appointed, and a report made on the\nelection frauds in our State, and we shall see, I suppose, whether any\nhelp comes of it.\n\nNow, you mustn't think, from all this, that I am an apostate from the\nprinciple of Women's Rights. No, indeed! All the trouble we have had,\nas I think will be evident to the millions who read my words, comes from\nTHE MEN. They have not only made politics their monopoly, but they have\nfashioned it into a tremendous, elaborate system, in which there is\nprecious little of either principle or honesty. We can and we MUST “run\nthe machine” (to use another of their vulgar expressions) with them,\nuntil we get a chance to knock off the useless wheels and thingumbobs,\nand scour the whole concern, inside and out. Perhaps the men themselves\nwould like to do this, if they only knew how: men have so little talent\nfor cleaning-up. But when it comes to making a litter, they're at home,\nlet me tell you!\n\nMeanwhile, in our State, things are about as bad as they can be.\nThe women are drawn for juries, the same as ever, but (except in\nWhittletown, where they have a separate room,) no respectable woman\ngoes, and the fines come heavy on some of us. The demoralization among\nour help is so bad, that we are going to try Co-operative Housekeeping.\nIf that don't succeed, I shall get brother Samuel, who lives in\nCalifornia, to send me two Chinamen, one for cook and chamber-boy, and\none as nurse for Melissa. I console myself with thinking that the end of\nit all must be good, since the principle is right: but, dear me! I had\nno idea that I should be called upon to go through such tribulation.\n\nNow the reason I write--and I suppose I must hurry to the end, or you\nwill be out of all patience--is to beg, and insist, and implore my\nsisters in other States to lose no more time, but at once to coax, or\nmelt, or threaten the men into accepting their claims. We are now so\nisolated in our rights that we are obliged to bear more than our proper\nshare of the burden. When the States around us shall be so far advanced,\nthere will be a chance for new stateswomen to spring up, and fill Mrs.\nWhiston's place, and we shall then, I firmly believe, devise a plan to\ncleanse the great Augean stable of politics by turning into it the river\nof female honesty and intelligence and morality. But they must do this,\nsomehow or other, without letting the river be tainted by the heaps of\npestilent offal it must sweep away. As Lord Bacon says (in that play\nfalsely attributed to Shakespeare)--“Ay, there's the rub!”\n\nIf you were to ask me, NOW, what effect the right of suffrage, office,\nand all the duties of men has had upon the morals of the women of our\nState, I should be puzzled what to say. It is something like this--if\nyou put a chemical purifying agent into a bucket of muddy water, the\nwater gets clearer, to be sure, but the chemical substance takes up some\nof the impurity. Perhaps that's rather too strong a comparison; but if\nyou say that men are worse than women, as most people do, then of course\nwe improve them by closer political intercourse, and lose a little\nourselves in the process. I leave you to decide the relative loss and\ngain. To tell you the truth, this is a feature of the question which\nI would rather not discuss; and I see, by the reports of the recent\nConventions, that all the champions of our sex feel the same way.\n\nWell, since I must come to an end somewhere, let it be here. To quote\nLord Bacon again, take my “round, unvarnished tale,” and perhaps the\nworld will yet acknowledge that some good has been done by\n\nYours truly,\n\nJANE STRONGITHARM.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Little Boris.]",
