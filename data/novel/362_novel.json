Arkwright in London through a common\nfriend; since then they had tramped half over Europe together in a\ncomradeship that was as delightful as it was unusual. As Calderwell put\nit in a letter to his sister, Belle:\n\n“We smoke the same cigar and drink the same tea (he's just as much of\nan old woman on that subject as I am!), and we agree beautifully on\nall necessary points of living, from tipping to late sleeping in the\nmorning; while as for politics and religion--we disagree in those just\nenough to lend spice to an otherwise tame existence.”\n\nFarther along in this same letter Calderwell touched upon his new friend\nagain.\n\n“I admit, however, I would like to know his name. To find out what that\nmysterious 'M. J.' stands for has got to be pretty nearly an obsession\nwith me. I am about ready to pick his pocket or rifle his trunk in\nsearch of some lurking 'Martin' or 'John' that will set me at peace. As\nit is, I confess that I have ogled his incoming mail and his outgoing\nbaggage shamelessly, only to be slapped in the face always and\neverlastingly by that bland 'M. J.' I've got my revenge, now, though. To\nmyself I call him 'Mary Jane'--and his broad-shouldered, brown-bearded\nsix feet of muscular manhood would so like to be called 'Mary Jane'!\nBy the way, Belle, if you ever hear of murder and sudden death in my\ndirection, better set the sleuths on the trail of Arkwright. Six to one\nyou'll find I called him 'Mary Jane' to his face!”\n\nCalderwell was thinking of that letter now, as he sat at a small table\nin a Paris café. Opposite him was the six feet of muscular manhood,\nbroad shoulders, pointed brown beard, and all--and he had just addressed\nit, inadvertently, as “Mary Jane.”\n\nDuring the brief, sickening moment of silence after the name had left\nhis lips, Calderwell was conscious of a whimsical realization of the\nlights, music, and laughter all about him.\n\n“Well, I chose as safe a place as I could!” he was thinking. Then\nArkwright spoke.\n\n“How long since you've been in correspondence with members of my\nfamily?”\n\n“Eh?”\n\nArkwright laughed grimly.\n\n“Perhaps you thought of it yourself, then--I'll admit you're capable of\nit,” he nodded, reaching for a cigar. “But it so happens you hit upon my\nfamily's favorite name for me.”\n\n“_Mary Jane!_ You mean they actually _call_ you that?”\n\n“Yes,” bowed the big fellow, calmly, as he struck a light.\n“Appropriate!--don't you think?”\n\nCalderwell did not answer. He thought he could not.\n\n“Well, silence gives consent, they say,” laughed the other. “Anyhow, you\nmust have had _some_ reason for calling me that.”\n\n“Arkwright, what _does_ 'M. J.' stand for?” demanded Calderwell.\n\n“Oh, is that it?” smiled the man opposite. “Well, I'll own those\ninitials have been something of a puzzle to people. One man declares\nthey're 'Merely Jokes'; but another, not so friendly, says they stand\nfor 'Mostly Jealousy' of more fortunate chaps who have real names for\na handle. My small brothers and sisters, discovering, with the usual\nperspicacity of one's family on such matters, that I never signed, or\ncalled myself anything but 'M. J.,' dubbed me 'Mary Jane.' And there you\nhave it.”\n\n“Mary Jane! You!”\n\nArkwright smiled oddly.\n\n“Oh, well, what's the difference? Would you deprive them of their\ninnocent amusement? And they do so love that 'Mary Jane'! Besides,\nwhat's in a name, anyway?” he went on, eyeing the glowing tip of the\ncigar between his fingers. “'A rose by any other name--'--you've\nheard that, probably. Names don't always signify, my dear fellow. For\ninstance, I know a 'Billy'--but he's a girl.”\n\nCalderwell gave a sudden start.\n\n“You don't mean Billy--Neilson?”\n\nThe other turned sharply.\n\n“Do _you_ know Billy Neilson?”\n\nCalderwell gave his friend a glance from scornful eyes.\n\n“Do I know Billy Neilson?” he cried. “Does a fellow usually know the\ngirl he's proposed to regularly once in three months? Oh, I know I'm\ntelling tales out of school, of course,” he went on, in response to the\nlook that had come into the brown eyes opposite. “But what's the use?\nEverybody knows it--that knows us. Billy herself got so she took it as\na matter of course--and refused as a matter of course, too; just as she\nwould refuse a serving of apple pie at dinner, if she hadn't wanted it.”\n\n“Apple pie!” scouted Arkwright.\n\nCalderwell shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“My dear fellow, you don't seem to realize it, but for the last six\nmonths you have been assisting at the obsequies of a dead romance.”\n\n“Indeed! And is it--buried, yet?”\n\n“Oh, no,” sighed Calderwell, cheerfully. “I shall go back one of these\ndays, I'll warrant, and begin the same old game again; though I will\nacknowledge that the last refusal was so very decided that it's been a\nyear, almost, since I received it. I think I was really convinced, for\na while, that--that she didn't want that apple pie,” he finished with\na whimsical lightness that did not quite coincide with the stern lines\nthat had come to his mouth.\n\nFor a moment there was silence, then Calderwell spoke again.\n\n“Where did you know--Miss Billy?”\n\n“Oh, I don't know her at all. I know of her--through Aunt Hannah.”\n\nCalderwell sat suddenly erect.\n\n“Aunt Hannah! Is she your aunt, too? Jove! This _is_ a little old world,\nafter all; isn't it?”\n\n“She isn't my aunt. She's my mother's third cousin. None of us have seen\nher for years, but she writes to mother occasionally; and, of course,\nfor some time now, her letters have been running over full of Billy. She\nlives with her, I believe; doesn't she?”\n\n“She does,” rejoined Calderwell, with an unexpected chuckle. “I wonder\nif you know how she happened to live with her, at first.”\n\n“Why, no, I reckon not. What do you mean?”\n\nCalderwell chuckled again.\n\n“Well, I'll tell you. You, being a 'Mary Jane,' ought to appreciate it.\nYou see, Billy was named for one William Henshaw, her father's chum,\nwho promptly forgot all about her. At eighteen, Billy, being left quite\nalone in the world, wrote to 'Uncle William' and asked to come and live\nwith him.”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“But it wasn't well. William was a forty-year-old widower who lived with\ntwo younger brothers, an old butler, and a Chinese cook in one of those\nfunny old Beacon Street houses in Boston. 'The Strata,' Bertram called\nit. Bright boy--Bertram!”\n\n“The Strata!”\n\n“Yes. I wish you could see that house, Arkwright. It's a regular layer\ncake. Cyril--he's the second brother; must be thirty-four or five\nnow--lives on the top floor in a rugless, curtainless, music-mad\nexistence--just a plain crank. Below him comes William. William collects\nthings--everything from tenpenny nails to teapots, I should say, and\nthey're all there in his rooms. Farther down somewhere comes Bertram.\nHe's _the_ Bertram Henshaw, you understand; the artist.”\n\n“Not the 'Face-of-a-Girl' Henshaw?”\n\n“The same; only of course four years ago he wasn't quite so well known\nas he is now. Well, to resume and go on. It was into this house, this\nmasculine paradise ruled over by Pete and Dong Ling in the kitchen, that\nBilly's naïve request for a home came.”\n\n“Great Scott!” breathed Arkwright, appreciatively.\n\n“Yes. Well, the letter was signed 'Billy.' They took her for a boy,\nnaturally, and after something of a struggle they agreed to let 'him'\ncome. For his particular delectation they fixed up a room next to\nBertram with guns and fishing rods, and such ladylike specialties; and\nWilliam went to the station to meet the boy.”\n\n“With never a suspicion?”\n\n“With never a suspicion.”\n\n“Gorry!”\n\n“Well, 'he' came, and 'she' conquered. I guess things were lively for\na while, though. Oh, there was a kitten, too, I believe, 'Spunk,' who\nadded to the gayety of nations.”\n\n“But what did the Henshaws do?”\n\n“Well, I wasn't there, of course; but Bertram says they spun around like\ntops gone mad for a time, but finally quieted down enough to summon a\nmarried sister for immediate propriety, and to establish Aunt Hannah for\npermanency the next day.”\n\n“So that's how it happened! Well, by George!” cried Arkwright.\n\n“Yes,” nodded the other. “So you see there are untold possibilities just\nin a name. Remember that. Just suppose _you_, as Mary Jane, should beg a\nhome in a feminine household--say in Miss Billy's, for instance!”\n\n“I'd like to,” retorted Arkwright, with sudden warmth.\n\nCalderwell stared a little.\n\nThe other laughed shamefacedly.\n\n“Oh, it's only that I happen to have a devouring curiosity to meet\nthat special young lady. I sing her songs (you know she's written some\ndandies!), I've heard a lot about her, and I've seen her picture.”\n (He did not add that he had also purloined that same picture from his\nmother's bureau--the picture being a gift from Aunt Hannah.) “So you\nsee I would, indeed, like to occupy a corner in the fair Miss Billy's\nhousehold. I could write to Aunt Hannah and beg a home with her, you\nknow; eh?”\n\n“Of course! Why don't you--'Mary Jane'?” laughed Calderwell. “Billy'd\ntake you all right. She's had a little Miss Hawthorn, a music teacher,\nthere for months. She's always doing stunts of that sort. Belle writes\nme that she's had a dozen forlornites there all this last summer, two\nor three at a time-tired widows, lonesome old maids, and crippled\nkids--just to give them a royal good time. So you see she'd take you,\nwithout a doubt. Jove! what a pair you'd make: Miss Billy and Mr. Mary\nJane! You'd drive the suffragettes into conniption fits--just by the\nsound of you!”\n\nArkwright laughed quietly; then he frowned.\n\n“But how about it?” he asked. “I thought she was keeping house with Aunt\nHannah. Didn't she stay at all with the Henshaws?”\n\n“Oh, yes, a few months. I never knew just why she did leave, but I\nfancied, from something Billy herself said once, that she discovered she\nwas creating rather too much of an upheaval in the Strata. So she took\nherself off. She went to school, and travelled considerably. She was\nover here when I met her first. After that she was with us all one\nsummer on the yacht. A couple of years ago, or so, she went back to\nBoston, bought a house and settled down with Aunt Hannah.”\n\n“And she's not married--or even engaged?”\n\n“Wasn't the last I heard. I haven't seen her since December, and I've\nheard from her only indirectly. She corresponds with my sister, and so\ndo I--intermittently. I heard a month ago from Belle, and _she_ had a\nletter from Billy in August. But I heard nothing of any engagement.”\n\n“How about the Henshaws? I should think there might be a chance there\nfor a romance--a charming girl, and three unattached men.”\n\nCalderwell gave a slow shake of the head.\n\n“I don't think so. William is--let me see--nearly forty-five, I guess,\nby this time; and he isn't a marrying man. He buried his heart with his\nwife and baby years ago. Cyril, according to Bertram, 'hates women\nand all other confusion,' so that ought to let him out. As for Bertram\nhimself--Bertram is 'only Bertram.' He's always been that. Bertram loves\ngirls--to paint; but I can't imagine him making serious love to any one.\nIt would always be the tilt of a chin or the turn of a cheek that he was\nadmiring--to paint. No, there's no chance for a romance there, I'll\nwarrant.”\n\n“But there's--yourself.”\n\nCalderwell's eyebrows rose the fraction of an inch.\n\n“Oh, of course. I presume January or February will find me back there,”\n he admitted with a sigh and a shrug. Then, a little bitterly, he added:\n“No, Arkwright. I shall keep away if I can. I _know_ there's no chance\nfor me--now.”\n\n“Then you'll leave me a clear field?” bantered the other.\n\n“Of course--'Mary Jane,'” retorted Calderwell, with equal lightness.\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“Oh, you needn't,” laughed Calderwell. “My giving you the right of way\ndoesn't insure you a thoroughfare for yourself--there are others, you\nknow. Billy Neilson has had sighing swains about I her, I imagine, since\nshe could walk and talk. She is a wonderfully fascinating little bit of\nfemininity, and she has a heart of pure gold. All is, I envy the man who\nwins it--for the man who wins that, wins her.”\n\nThere was no answer. Arkwright sat with his eyes on the moving throng\noutside the window near them. Perhaps he had not heard. At all events,\nwhen he spoke some time later, it was of a matter far removed from Miss\nBilly Neilson, or the way to her heart. Nor was the young lady mentioned\nbetween them again that day.\n\nLong hours later, just before parting for the night, Arkwright said:\n\n“Calderwell, I'm sorry, but I believe, after all, I can't take that trip\nto the lakes with you. I--I'm going home next week.”\n\n“Home! Hang it, Arkwright! I'd counted on you. Isn't this rather\nsudden?”\n\n“Yes, and no. I'll own I've been drifting about with you contentedly\nenough for the last six months to make you think mountain-climbing and\nboat-paddling were the end and aim of my existence. But they aren't, you\nknow, really.”\n\n“Nonsense! At heart you're as much of a vagabond as I am; and you know\nit.”\n\n“Perhaps. But unfortunately I don't happen to carry your pocketbook.”\n\n“You may, if you like. I'll hand it over any time,” grinned Calderwell.\n\n“Thanks. You know well enough what I mean,” shrugged the other.\n\nThere was a moment's silence; then Calderwell queried:\n\n“Arkwright, how old are you?”\n\n“Twenty-four.”\n\n“Good! Then you're merely travelling to supplement your education, see?”\n\n“Oh, yes, I see. But something besides my education has got to be\nsupplemented now, I reckon.”\n\n“What are you going to do?”\n\nThere was an almost imperceptible hesitation; then, a little shortly,\ncame the answer:\n\n“Hit the trail for Grand Opera, and bring up, probably--in vaudeville.”\n\nCalderwell smiled appreciatively.\n\n“You _can_ sing like the devil,” he admitted.\n\n“Thanks,” returned his friend, with uplifted eyebrows. “Do you mind\ncalling it 'an angel'--just for this occasion?”\n\n“Oh, the matinée-girls will do that fast enough. But, I say,\nArkwright, what are you going to do with those initials then?”\n\n“Let 'em alone.”\n\n“Oh, no, you won't. And you won't be 'Mary Jane,' either. Imagine a Mary\nJane in Grand Opera! I know what you'll be. You'll be 'Señor Martini\nJohnini Arkwrightino'! By the way, you didn't say what that 'M. J.'\nreally did stand for,” hinted Calderwell, shamelessly.\n\n“'Merely Jokes'--in your estimation, evidently,” shrugged the other.\n“But my going isn't a joke, Calderwell. I'm really going. And I'm going\nto work.”\n\n“But--how shall you manage?”\n\n“Time will tell.”\n\nCalderwell frowned and stirred restlessly in his chair.\n\n“But, honestly, now, to--to follow that trail of yours will take\nmoney. And--er--” a faint red stole to his forehead--“don't they\nhave--er--patrons for these young and budding geniuses? Why can't I have\na hand in this trail, too--or maybe you'd call it a foot, eh? I'd be no\nend glad to, Arkwright.”\n\n“Thanks, old man.” The red was duplicated this time above the brown\nsilky beard. “That was mighty kind of you, and I appreciate it; but it\nwon't be necessary. A generous, but perhaps misguided bachelor uncle\nleft me a few thousands a year or so ago; and I'm going to put them all\ndown my throat--or rather, _into_ it--before I give up.”\n\n“Where you going to study? New York?”\n\nAgain there was an almost imperceptible hesitation before the answer\ncame.\n\n“I'm not quite prepared to say.”\n\n“Why not try it here?”\n\nArkwright shook his head.\n\n“I did plan to, when I came over but I've changed my mind. I believe I'd\nrather work while longer in America.”\n\n“Hm-m,” murmured Calderwell.\n\nThere was a brief silence, followed by other questions and other\nanswers; after which the friends said good night.\n\nIn his own room, as he was dropping off to sleep, Calderwell muttered\ndrowsily:\n\n“By George! I haven't found out yet what that blamed 'M. J.' stands\nfor!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. AUNT HANNAH GETS A LETTER\n\n\nIn the cozy living-room at Hillside, Billy Neilson's pretty home on\nCorey Hill, Billy herself sat writing at the desk. Her pen had just\ntraced the date, “October twenty-fifth,” when Mrs. Stetson entered with\na letter in her hand.\n\n“Writing, my dear? Then don't let me disturb you.” She turned as if to\ngo.\n\nBilly dropped her pen, sprang to her feet, flew to the little woman's\nside and whirled her half across the room.\n\n“There!” she exclaimed, as she plumped the breathless and scandalized\nAunt Hannah into the biggest easy chair. “I feel better. I just had to\nlet off steam some way. It's so lovely you came in just when you did!”\n\n“Indeed! I--I'm not so sure of that,” stammered the lady, dropping the\nletter into her lap, and patting with agitated fingers her cap, her\ncurls, the two shawls about her shoulders, and the lace at her throat.\n“My grief and conscience, Billy! Wors't you _ever_ grow up?”\n\n“Hope not,” purred Billy cheerfully, dropping herself on to a low\nhassock at Aunt Hannah's feet.\n\n“But, my dear, you--you're engaged!”\n\nBilly bubbled into a chuckling laugh.\n\n“As if I didn't know that, when I've just written a dozen notes to\nannounce it! And, oh, Aunt Hannah, such a time as I've had, telling what\na dear Bertram is, and how I love, love, _love_ him, and what beautiful\neyes he has, and _such_ a nose, and--”\n\n“Billy!” Aunt Hannah was sitting erect in pale horror.\n\n“Eh?” Billy's eyes were roguish.\n\n“You didn't write that in those notes!”\n\n“Write it? Oh, no! That's only what I _wanted_ to write,” chuckled\nBilly. “What I really did write was as staid and proper as--here, let me\nshow you,” she broke off, springing to her feet and running over to her\ndesk. “There! this is about what I wrote to them all,” she finished,\nwhipping a note out of one of the unsealed envelopes on the desk and\nspreading it open before Aunt Hannah's suspicious eyes.\n\n“Hm-m; that is very good--for you,” admitted the lady.\n\n“Well, I like that!--after all my stern self-control and self-sacrifice\nto keep out all those things I _wanted_ to write,” bridled Billy.\n“Besides, they'd have been ever so much more interesting reading than\nthese will be,” she pouted, as she took the note from her companion's\nhand.\n\n“I don't doubt it,” observed Aunt Hannah, dryly.\n\nBilly laughed, and tossed the note back on the desk.\n\n“I'm writing to Belle Calderwell, now,” she announced musingly, dropping\nherself again on the hassock. “I suppose she'll tell Hugh.”\n\n“Poor boy! He'll be disappointed.”\n\nBilly sighed, but she uptilted her chin a little.\n\n“He ought not to be. I told him long, long ago, the very first time,\nthat--that I couldn't.”\n\n“I know, dear; but--they don't always understand.” Aunt Hannah sighed\nin sympathy with the far-away Hugh Calderwell, as she looked down at the\nbright young face near her.\n\nThere was a moment's silence; then Billy gave a little laugh.\n\n“He _will_ be surprised,” she said. “He told me once that Bertram\nwouldn't ever care for any girl except to paint. To paint, indeed! As\nif Bertram didn't love me--just _me!_--if he never saw another tube of\npaint!”\n\n“I think he does, my dear.”\n\nAgain there was silence; then, from Billy's lips there came softly:\n\n“Just think; we've been engaged almost four weeks--and to-morrow it'll\nbe announced. I'm so glad I didn't ever announce the other two!”\n\n“The other _two!_” cried Aunt Hannah.\n\nBilly laughed.\n\n“Oh, I forgot. You didn't know about Cyril.”\n\n“Cyril!”\n\n“Oh, there didn't anybody know it, either not even Cyril himself,”\n dimpled Billy, mischievously. “I just engaged myself to him in\nimagination, you know, to see how I'd like it. I didn't like it. But\nit didn't last, anyhow, very long--just three weeks, I believe. Then I\nbroke it off,” she finished, with unsmiling mouth, but dancing eyes.\n\n“Billy!” protested Aunt Hannah, feebly.\n\n“But I _am_ glad only the family knew about my engagement to Uncle\nWilliam--oh, Aunt Hannah, you don't know how good it does seem to call\nhim 'Uncle' again. It was always slipping out, anyhow, all the time we\nwere engaged; and of course it was awful then.”\n\n“That only goes to prove, my dear, how entirely unsuitable it was, from\nthe start.”\n\nA bright color flooded Billy's face.\n\n“I know; but if a girl _will_ think a man is asking for a wife when all\nhe wants is a daughter, and if she blandly says 'Yes, thank you, I'll\nmarry you,' I don't know what you can expect!”\n\n“You can expect just what you got--misery, and almost a tragedy,”\n retorted Aunt Hannah, severely.\n\nA tender light came into Billy's eyes.\n\n“Dear Uncle William! What a jewel he was, all the way through! And he'd\nhave marched straight to the altar, too, with never a flicker of an\neyelid, I know--self-sacrificing martyr that he was!”\n\n“Martyr!” bristled Aunt Hannah, with extraordinary violence for her.\n“I'm thinking that term belonged somewhere else. A month ago, Billy\nNeilson, you did not look as if you'd live out half your days. But I\nsuppose _you'd_ have gone to the altar, too, with never a flicker of an\neyelid!”\n\n“But I thought I had to,” protested Billy. “I couldn't grieve Uncle\nWilliam so, after Mrs. Hartwell had said how he--he wanted me.”\n\nAunt Hannah's lips grew stern at the corners.\n\n“There are times when--when I think it would be wiser if Mrs. Kate\nHartwell would attend to her own affairs!” Aunt Hannah's voice fairly\nshook with wrath.\n\n“Why-Aunt Hannah!” reproved Billy in mischievous horror. “I'm shocked at\nyou!”\n\nAunt Hannah flushed miserably.\n\n“There, there, child, forget I said it. I ought not to have said it, of\ncourse,” she murmured agitatedly.\n\nBilly laughed.\n\n“You should have heard what Uncle William said! But never mind. We all\nfound out the mistake before it was too late, and everything is lovely\nnow, even to Cyril and Marie. Did you ever see anything so beatifically\nhappy as that couple are? Bertram says he hasn't heard a dirge from\nCyril's rooms for three weeks; and that if anybody else played the kind\nof music he's been playing, it would be just common garden ragtime!”\n\n“Music! Oh, my grief and conscience! That makes me think, Billy. If I'm\nnot actually forgetting what I came in here for,” cried Aunt Hannah,\nfumbling in the folds of her dress for the letter that had slipped from\nher lap. “I've had word from a young niece. She's going to study music\nin Boston.”\n\n“A niece?”\n\n“Well, not really, you know. She calls me 'Aunt,' just as you and the\nHenshaw boys do. But I really am related to _her_, for her mother and I\nare third cousins, while it was my husband who was distantly related to\nthe Henshaw family.”\n\n“What's her name?”\n\n“'Mary Jane Arkwright.' Where is that letter?”\n\n“Here it is, on the floor,” reported Billy. “Were you going to read it\nto me?” she asked, as she picked it up.\n\n“Yes--if you don't mind.”\n\n“I'd love to hear it.”\n\n“Then I'll read it. It--it rather annoys me in some ways. I thought the\nwhole family understood that I wasn't living by myself any longer--that\nI was living with you. I'm sure I thought I wrote them that, long ago.\nBut this sounds almost as if they didn't understand it--at least, as if\nthis girl didn't.”\n\n“How old is she?”\n\n“I don't know; but she must be some old, to be coming here to Boston to\nstudy music, alone--singing, I think she said.”\n\n“You don't remember her, then?”\n\nAunt Hannah frowned and paused, the letter half withdrawn from its\nenvelope.\n\n“No--but that isn't strange. They live West. I haven't seen any of them\nfor years. I know there are several children--and I suppose I've been\ntold their names. I know there's a boy--the eldest, I think--who is\nquite a singer, and there's a girl who paints, I believe; but I don't\nseem to remember a 'Mary Jane.'”\n\n“Never mind! Suppose we let Mary Jane speak for herself,” suggested\nBilly, dropping her chin into the small pink cup of her hand, and\nsettling herself to listen.\n\n“Very well,” sighed Aunt Hannah; and she opened the letter and began to\nread.\n\n\n     “DEAR AUNT HANNAH:--This is to tell you\n     that I'm coming to Boston to study singing in\n     the school for Grand Opera, and I'm planning to\n     look you up. Do you object? I said to a friend\n     the other day that I'd half a mind to write to Aunt\n     Hannah and beg a home with her; and my friend\n     retorted: 'Why don't you, Mary Jane?' But\n     that, of course, I should not think of doing.\n\n     “But I know I shall be lonesome, Aunt Hannah,\n     and I hope you'll let me see you once in a\n     while, anyway. I plan now to come next week\n     --I've already got as far as New York, as you see\n     by the address--and I shall hope to see you\n     soon.\n\n     “All the family would send love, I know.\n                  “M. J. ARKWRIGHT.”\n\n\n“Grand Opera! Oh, how perfectly lovely,” cried Billy.\n\n“Yes, but Billy, do you think she is expecting me to invite her to make\nher home with me? I shall have to write and explain that I can't--if she\ndoes, of course.”\n\nBilly frowned and hesitated.\n\n“Why, it sounded--a little--that way; but--” Suddenly her face cleared.\n“Aunt Hannah, I've thought of the very thing. We _will_ take her!”\n\n“Oh, Billy, I couldn't think of letting you do that,” demurred Aunt\nHannah. “You're very kind--but, oh, no; not that!”\n\n“Why not? I think it would be lovely; and we can just as well as not.\nAfter Marie is married in December, she can have that room. Until then\nshe can have the little blue room next to me.”\n\n“But--but--we don't know anything about her.”\n\n“We know she's your niece, and she's lonesome; and we know she's\nmusical. I shall love her for every one of those things. Of course we'll\ntake her!”\n\n“But--I don't know anything about her age.”\n\n“All the more reason why she should be looked out for, then,” retorted\nBilly, promptly. “Why, Aunt Hannah, just as if you didn't want to give\nthis lonesome, unprotected young girl a home!”\n\n“Oh, I do, of course; but--”\n\n“Then it's all settled,” interposed Billy, springing to her feet.\n\n“But what if we--we shouldn't like her?”\n\n“Nonsense! What if she shouldn't like us?” laughed Billy. “However, if\nyou'd feel better, just ask her to come and stay with us a month. We\nshall keep her all right, afterwards. See if we don't!”\n\nSlowly Aunt Hannah got to her feet.\n\n“Very well, dear. I'll write, of course, as you tell me to; and it's\nlovely of you to do it. Now I'll leave you to your letters. I've\nhindered you far too long, as it is.”\n\n“You've rested me,” declared Billy, flinging wide her arms.\n\nAunt Hannah, fearing a second dizzying whirl impelled by those same\nyoung arms, drew her shawls about her shoulders and backed hastily\ntoward the hall door.\n\nBilly laughed.\n\n“Oh, I won't again--to-day,” she promised merrily. Then, as the lady\nreached the arched doorway: “Tell Mary Jane to let us know the day\nand train and we'll meet her. Oh, and Aunt Hannah, tell her to wear a\npink--a white pink; and tell her we will, too,” she finished gayly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. BILLY AND BERTRAM\n\n\nBertram called that evening. Before the open fire in the living-room he\nfound a pensive Billy awaiting him--a Billy who let herself be kissed,\nit is true, and who even kissed back, shyly, adorably; but a Billy who\nlooked at him with wide, almost frightened eyes.\n\n“Why, darling, what's the matter?” he demanded, his own eyes growing\nwide and frightened.\n\n“Bertram, it's--done!”\n\n“What's done? What do you mean?”\n\n“Our engagement. It's--announced. I wrote stacks of notes to-day,\nand even now there are some left for to-morrow. And then there's--the\nnewspapers. Bertram, right away, now, _everybody_ will know it.” Her\nvoice was tragic.\n\nBertram relaxed visibly. A tender light came to his eyes.\n\n“Well, didn't you expect everybody would know it, my dear?”\n\n“Y-yes; but--”\n\nAt her hesitation, the tender light changed to a quick fear.\n\n“Billy, you aren't--sorry?”\n\nThe pink glory that suffused her face answered him before her words did.\n\n“Sorry! Oh, never, Bertram! It's only that it won't be ours any\nlonger--that is, it won't belong to just our two selves. Everybody will\nknow it. And they'll bow and smile and say 'How lovely!' to our faces,\nand 'Did you ever?' to our backs. Oh, no, I'm not sorry, Bertram; but I\nam--afraid.”\n\n“_Afraid_--Billy!”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nBilly sighed, and gazed with pensive eyes into the fire.\n\nAcross Bertram's face swept surprise, consternation, and dismay. Bertram\nhad thought he knew Billy in all her moods and fancies; but he did not\nknow her in this one.\n\n“Why, Billy!” he breathed.\n\nBilly drew another sigh. It seemed to come from the very bottoms of her\nsmall, satin-slippered feet.\n\n“Well, I am. You're _the_ Bertram Henshaw. You know lots and lots of\npeople that I never even saw. And they'll come and stand around and\nstare and lift their lorgnettes and say: 'Is that the one? Dear me!'”\n\nBertram gave a relieved laugh.\n\n“Nonsense, sweetheart! I should think you were a picture I'd painted and\nhung on a wall.”\n\n“I shall feel as if I were--with all those friends of yours. Bertram,\nwhat if they don't like it?” Her voice had grown tragic again.\n\n“_Like_ it!”\n\n“Yes. The picture--me, I mean.”\n\n“They can't help liking it,” he retorted, with the prompt certainty of\nan adoring lover.\n\nBilly shook her head. Her eyes had gone back to the fire.\n\n“Oh, yes, they can. I can hear them. 'What, _she_--Bertram Henshaw's\nwife?--a frivolous, inconsequential “Billy” like that?' Bertram!”--Billy\nturned fiercely despairing eyes on her lover--“Bertram, sometimes I\nwish my name were 'Clarissa Cordelia,' or 'Arabella Maud,' or 'Hannah\nJane'--anything that's feminine and proper!”\n\nBertram's ringing laugh brought a faint smile to Billy's lips. But the\nwords that followed the laugh, and the caressing touch of the man's\nhands sent a flood of shy color to her face.\n\n“'Hannah Jane,' indeed! As if I'd exchange my Billy for her or any\nClarissa or Arabella that ever grew! I adore Billy--flame, nature,\nand--”\n\n“And naughtiness?” put in Billy herself.\n\n“Yes--if there be any,” laughed Bertram, fondly. “But, see,” he added,\ntaking a tiny box from his pocket, “see what I've brought for this same\nBilly to wear. She'd have had it long ago if she hadn't insisted on\nwaiting for this announcement business.”\n\n“Oh, Bertram, what a beauty!” dimpled Billy, as the flawless diamond in\nBertram's fingers caught the light and sent it back in a flash of flame\nand crimson.\n\n“Now you are mine--really mine, sweetheart!” The man's voice and hand\nshook as he slipped the ring on Billy's outstretched finger.\n\nBilly caught her breath with almost a sob.\n\n“And I'm so glad to be--yours, dear,” she murmured brokenly. “And--and\nI'll make you proud that I am yours, even if I am just 'Billy,'” she\nchoked. “Oh, I know I'll write such beautiful, beautiful songs now.”\n\nThe man drew her into a close embrace.\n\n“As if I cared for that,” he scoffed lovingly.\n\nBilly looked up in quick horror.\n\n“Why, Bertram, you don't mean you don't--care?”\n\nHe laughed lightly, and took the dismayed little face between his two\nhands.\n\n“Care, darling? of course I care! You know how I love your music. I\ncare about everything that concerns you. I meant that I'm proud of you\n_now_--just you. I love _you_, you know.”\n\nThere was a moment's pause. Billy's eyes, as they looked at him, carried\na curious intentness in their dark depths.\n\n“You mean, you like--the turn of my head and the tilt of my chin?” she\nasked a little breathlessly.\n\n“I adore them!” came the prompt answer.\n\nTo Bertram's utter amazement, Billy drew back with a sharp cry.\n\n“No, no--not that!”\n\n“Why, _Billy!_”\n\nBilly laughed unexpectedly; then she sighed.\n\n“Oh, it's all right, of course,” she assured him hastily. “It's only--”\n Billy stopped and blushed. Billy was thinking of what Hugh Calderwell\nhad once said to her: that Bertram Henshaw would never love any girl\nseriously; that it would always be the turn of her head or the tilt of\nher chin that he loved--to paint.\n\n“Well; only what?” demanded Bertram.\n\nBilly blushed the more deeply, but she gave a light laugh.\n\n“Nothing, only something Hugh Calderwell said to me once. You see,\nBertram, I don't think Hugh ever thought you would--marry.”\n\n“Oh, didn't he?” bridled Bertram. “Well, that only goes to show how much\nhe knows about it. Er--did you announce it--to him?” Bertram's voice was\nalmost savage now.\n\nBilly smiled.\n\n“No; but I did to his sister, and she'll tell him. Oh, Bertram, such a\ntime as I had over those notes,” went on Billy, with a chuckle. Her\neyes were dancing, and she was seeming more like her usual self, Bertram\nthought. “You see there were such a lot of things I wanted to say, about\nwhat a dear you were, and how much I--I liked you, and that you had such\nlovely eyes, and a nose--”\n\n“Billy!” This time it was Bertram who was sitting erect in pale horror.\n\nBilly threw him a roguish glance.\n\n“Goosey! You are as bad as Aunt Hannah! I said that was what I _wanted_\nto say. What I really said was--quite another matter,” she finished with\na saucy uptilting of her chin.\n\nBertram relaxed with a laugh.\n\n“You witch!” His admiring eyes still lingered on her face. “Billy, I'm\ngoing to paint you sometime in just that pose. You're adorable!”\n\n“Pooh! Just another face of a girl,” teased the adorable one.\n\nBertram gave a sudden exclamation.\n\n“There! And I haven't told you, yet. Guess what my next commission is.”\n\n“To paint a portrait?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Can't. Who is it?”\n\n“J. G. Winthrop's daughter.”\n\n“Not _the_ J. G. Winthrop?”\n\n“The same.”\n\n“Oh, Bertram, how splendid!”\n\n“Isn't it? And then the girl herself! Have you seen her? But you\nhaven't, I know, unless you met her abroad. She hasn't been in Boston\nfor years until now.”\n\n“No, I haven't seen her. Is she so _very_ beautiful?” Billy spoke a\nlittle soberly.\n\n“Yes--and no.” The artist lifted his head alertly. What Billy called\nhis “painting look” came to his face. “It isn't that her features are so\nregular--though her mouth and chin are perfect. But her face has so much\ncharacter, and there's an elusive something about her eyes--Jove! If\nI can only catch it, it'll be the best thing yet that I've ever done,\nBilly.”\n\n“Will it? I'm so glad--and you'll get it, I know you will,” claimed\nBilly, clearing her throat a little nervously.\n\n“I wish I felt so sure,” sighed Bertram. “But it'll be a great thing if\nI do get it--J. G. Winthrop's daughter, you know, besides the merit of\nthe likeness itself.”\n\n“Yes; yes, indeed!” Billy cleared her throat again. “You've seen her, of\ncourse, lately?”\n\n“Oh, yes. I was there half the morning discussing the details--sittings\nand costume, and deciding on the pose.”\n\n“Did you find one--to suit?”\n\n“Find one!” The artist made a despairing gesture. “I found a dozen that\nI wanted. The trouble was to tell which I wanted the most.”\n\nBilly gave a nervous little laugh.\n\n“Isn't that--unusual?” she asked.\n\nBertram lifted his eyebrows with a quizzical smile.\n\n“Well, they aren't all Marguerite Winthrops,” he reminded her.\n\n“Marguerite!” cried Billy. “Oh, is her name Marguerite? I do think\nMarguerite is the dearest name!” Billy's eyes and voice were wistful.\n\n“I don't--not the _dearest_. Oh, it's all well enough, of course, but it\ncan't be compared for a moment to--well, say, 'Billy'!”\n\nBilly smiled, but she shook her head.\n\n“I'm afraid you're not a good judge of names,” she objected.\n\n“Yes, I am; though, for that matter, I should love your name, no matter\nwhat it was.”\n\n“Even if 'twas 'Mary Jane,' eh?” bantered Billy. “Well, you'll have a\nchance to find out how you like that name pretty quick, sir. We're going\nto have one here.”\n\n“You're going to have a Mary Jane here? Do you mean that Rosa's going\naway?”\n\n“Mercy! I hope not,” shuddered Billy. “You don't find a Rosa in every\nkitchen--and never in employment agencies! My Mary Jane is a niece of\nAunt Hannah's,--or rather, a cousin. She's coming to Boston to study\nmusic, and I've invited her here. We've asked her for a month, though I\npresume we shall keep her right along.”\n\nBertram frowned.\n\n“Well, of course, that's very nice for--_Mary Jane_,” he sighed with\nmeaning emphasis.\n\nBilly laughed.\n\n“Don't worry, dear. She won't bother us any.”\n\n“Oh, yes, she will,” sighed Bertram. “She'll be 'round--lots; you see\nif she isn't. Billy, I think sometimes you're almost too kind--to other\nfolks.”\n\n“Never!” laughed Billy. “Besides, what would you have me do when a\nlonesome young girl was coming to Boston? Anyhow, _you're_ not the one\nto talk, young man. I've known _you_ to take in a lonesome girl and give\nher a home,” she flashed merrily.\n\nBertram chuckled.\n\n“Jove! What a time that was!” he exclaimed, regarding his companion with\nfond eyes. “And Spunk, too! Is she going to bring a Spunk?”\n\n“Not that I've heard,” smiled Billy; “but she _is_ going to wear a\npink.”\n\n“Not really, Billy?”\n\n“Of course she is! I told her to. How do you suppose we could know her\nwhen we saw her, if she didn't?” demanded the girl, indignantly. “And\nwhat is more, sir, there will be _two_ pinks worn this time. _I_ sha'n't\ndo as Uncle William did, and leave off my pink. Only think what long\nminutes--that seemed hours of misery--I spent waiting there in that\ntrain-shed, just because I didn't know which man was my Uncle William!”\n\nBertram laughed and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“Well, your Mary Jane won't probably turn out to be quite such a\nbombshell as our Billy did--unless she should prove to be a boy,” he\nadded whimsically. “Oh, but Billy, she _can't_ turn out to be such a\ndear treasure,” finished the man. And at the adoring look in his eyes\nBilly blushed deeply--and promptly forgot all about Mary Jane and her\npink.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. FOR MARY JANE\n\n\n“I have a letter here from Mary Jane, my dear,” announced Aunt Hannah at\nthe luncheon table one day.\n\n“Have you?” Billy raised interested eyes from her own letters. “What\ndoes she say?”\n\n“She will be here Thursday. Her train is due at the South Station at\nfour-thirty. She seems to be very grateful to you for your offer to let\nher come right here for a month; but she says she's afraid you don't\nrealize, perhaps, just what you are doing--to take her in like that,\nwith her singing, and all.”\n\n“Nonsense! She doesn't refuse, does she?”\n\n“Oh, no; she doesn't refuse--but she doesn't accept either, exactly, as\nI can see. I've read the letter over twice, too. I'll let you judge for\nyourself by and by, when you have time to read it.”\n\nBilly laughed.\n\n“Never mind. I don't want to read it. She's just a little shy about\ncoming, that's all. She'll stay all right, when we come to meet her.\nWhat time did you say it was, Thursday?”\n\n“Half past four, South Station.”\n\n“Thursday, at half past four. Let me see--that's the day of the\nCarletons' 'At Home,' isn't it?”\n\n“Oh, my grief and conscience, yes! But I had forgotten it. What shall we\ndo?”\n\n“Oh, that will be easy. We'll just go to the Carletons' early and have\nJohn wait, then take us from there to the South Station. Meanwhile we'll\nmake sure that the little blue room is all ready for her. I put in my\nwhite enamel work-basket yesterday, and that pretty little blue case for\nhairpins and curling tongs that I bought at the fair. I want the room to\nlook homey to her, you know.”\n\n“As if it could look any other way, if _you_ had anything to do with\nit,” sighed Aunt Hannah, admiringly.\n\nBilly laughed.\n\n“If we get stranded we might ask the Henshaw boys to help us out, Aunt\nHannah. They'd probably suggest guns and swords. That's the way they\nfixed up _my_ room.”\n\nAunt Hannah raised shocked hands of protest.\n\n“As if we would! Mercy, what a time that was!”\n\nBilly laughed again.\n\n“I never shall forget, _never_, my first glimpse of that room when Mrs.\nHartwell switched on the lights. Oh, Aunt Hannah, I wish you could have\nseen it before they took out those guns and spiders!”\n\n“As if I didn't see quite enough when I saw William's face that morning\nhe came for me!” retorted Aunt Hannah, spiritedly.\n\n“Dear Uncle William! What an old saint he has been all the way through,”\n mused Billy aloud. “And Cyril--who would ever have believed that the\nday would come when Cyril would say to me, as he did last night, that he\nfelt as if Marie had been gone a month. It's been just seven days, you\nknow.”\n\n“I know. She comes to-morrow, doesn't she?”\n\n“Yes, and I'm glad. I shall tell Marie she needn't leave Cyril on _my_\nhands again. Bertram says that at home Cyril hasn't played a dirge since\nhis engagement; but I notice that up here--where Marie might be, but\nisn't--his tunes would never be mistaken for ragtime. By the way,” she\nadded, as she rose from the table, “that's another surprise in store for\nHugh Calderwell. He always declared that Cyril wasn't a marrying man,\neither, any more than Bertram. You know he said Bertram only cared for\ngirls to paint; but--” She stopped and looked inquiringly at Rosa, who\nhad appeared at that moment in the hall doorway.\n\n“It's the telephone, Miss Neilson. Mr. Bertram Henshaw wants you.”\n\nA few minutes later Aunt Hannah heard Billy at the piano. For fifteen,\ntwenty, thirty minutes the brilliant scales and arpeggios rippled\nthrough the rooms and up the stairs to Aunt Hannah, who knew, by the\nvery sound of them, that some unusual nervousness was being worked off\nat the finger tips that played them. At the end of forty-five minutes\nAunt Hannah went down-stairs.\n\n“Billy, my dear, excuse me, but have you forgotten what time it is?\nWeren't you going out with Bertram?”\n\nBilly stopped playing at once, but she did not turn her head. Her\nfingers busied themselves with some music on the piano.\n\n“We aren't going, Aunt Hannah,” she said.\n\n“Bertram can't.”\n\n“_Can't!_”\n\n“Well, he didn't want to--so of course I said not to. He's been painting\nthis morning on a new portrait, and she said he might stay to luncheon\nand keep right on for a while this afternoon, if he liked. And--he did\nlike, so he stayed.”\n\n“Why, how--how--” Aunt Hannah stopped helplessly.\n\n“Oh, no, not at all,” interposed Billy, lightly. “He told me all about\nit the other night. It's going to be a very wonderful portrait; and,\nof course, I wouldn't want to interfere with--his work!” And again a\nbrilliant scale rippled from Billy's fingers after a crashing chord in\nthe bass.\n\nSlowly Aunt Hannah turned and went up-stairs. Her eyes were troubled.\nNot since Billy's engagement had she heard Billy play like that.\n\nBertram did not find a pensive Billy awaiting him that evening. He\nfound a bright-eyed, flushed-cheeked Billy, who let herself be\nkissed--once--but who did not kiss back; a blithe, elusive Billy, who\nplayed tripping little melodies, and sang jolly little songs, instead\nof sitting before the fire and talking; a Billy who at last turned, and\nasked tranquilly:\n\n“Well, how did the picture go?”\n\nBertram rose then, crossed the room, and took Billy very gently into his\narms.\n\n“Sweetheart, you were a dear this noon to let me off like that,” he\nbegan in a voice shaken with emotion. “You don't know, perhaps, exactly\nwhat you did. You see, I was nearly wild between wanting to be with you,\nand wanting to go on with my work. And I was just at that point\nwhere one little word from you, one hint that you wanted me to come\nanyway--and I should have come. But you didn't say it, nor hint it. Like\nthe brave little bit of inspiration that you are, you bade me stay and\ngo on with my work.”\n\nThe “inspiration's” head drooped a little lower, but this only brought\na wealth of soft bronze hair to just where Bertram could lay his cheek\nagainst it--and Bertram promptly took advantage of his opportunity. “And\nso I stayed, Billy, and I did good work; I know I did good work. Why,\nBilly,”--Bertram stepped back now, and held Billy by the shoulders at\narms' length--“Billy, that's going to be the best work I've ever done. I\ncan see it coming even now, under my fingers.”\n\nBilly lifted her head and looked into her lover's face. His eyes were\nglowing. His cheeks were flushed. His whole countenance was aflame with\nthe soul of the artist who sees his vision taking shape before him. And\nBilly, looking at him, felt suddenly--ashamed.\n\n“Oh, Bertram, I'm proud, proud, _proud_ of you!” she breathed. “Come,\nlet's go over to the fire-and talk!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. MARIE SPEAKS HER MIND\n\n\nBilly with John and Peggy met Marie Hawthorn at the station. “Peggy”\n was short for “Pegasus,” and was what Billy always called her luxurious,\nseven-seated touring car.\n\n“I simply won't call it 'automobile,'” she had declared when she bought\nit. “In the first place, it takes too long to say it, and in the second\nplace, I don't want to add one more to the nineteen different ways to\npronounce it that I hear all around me every day now. As for calling it\nmy 'car,' or my 'motor car'--I should expect to see a Pullman or one\nof those huge black trucks before my door, if I ordered it by either of\nthose names. Neither will I insult the beautiful thing by calling it a\n'machine.' Its name is Pegasus. I shall call it 'Peggy.'”\n\nAnd “Peggy” she called it. John sniffed his disdain, and Billy's friends\nmade no secret of their amused tolerance; but, in an astonishingly short\ntime, half the automobile owners of her acquaintance were calling their\nown cars “Peggy”; and even the dignified John himself was heard to order\n“some gasoline for Peggy,” quite as a matter of course.\n\nWhen Marie Hawthorn stepped from the train at the North Station she\ngreeted Billy with affectionate warmth, though at once her blue eyes\nswept the space beyond expectantly and eagerly.\n\nBilly's lips curved in a mischievous smile.\n\n“No, he didn't come,” she said. “He didn't want to--a little bit.”\n\nMarie grew actually pale.\n\n“Didn't _want_ to!” she stammered.\n\nBilly gave her a spasmodic hug.\n\n“Goosey! No, he didn't--a _little_ bit; but he did a great _big_ bit.\nAs if you didn't know he was dying to come, Marie! But he simply\ncouldn't--something about his concert Monday night. He told me over the\ntelephone; but between his joy that you were coming, and his rage that\nhe couldn't see you the first minute you did come, I couldn't quite make\nout what was the trouble. But he's coming to dinner to-night, so he'll\ndoubtless tell you all about it.”\n\nMarie sighed her relief.\n\n“Oh, that's all right then. I was afraid he was sick--when I didn't see\nhim.”\n\nBilly laughed softly.\n\n“No, he isn't sick, Marie; but you needn't go away again before the\nwedding--not to leave him on my hands. I wouldn't have believed Cyril\nHenshaw, confirmed old bachelor and avowed woman-hater, could have acted\nthe part of a love-sick boy as he has the last week or two.”\n\nThe rose-flush on Marie's cheek spread to the roots of her fine yellow\nhair.\n\n“Billy, dear, he--he didn't!”\n\n“Marie, dear--he--he did!”\n\nMarie laughed. She did not say anything, but the rose-flush deepened\nas she occupied herself very busily in getting her trunk-check from the\nlittle hand bag she carried.\n\nCyril was not mentioned again until the two girls, veils tied and coats\nbuttoned, were snugly ensconced in the tonneau, and Peggy's nose was\nturned toward home. Then Billy asked:\n\n“Have you settled on where you're going to live?”\n\n“Not quite. We're going to talk of that to-night; but we _do_ know that\nwe aren't going to live at the Strata.”\n\n“Marie!”\n\nMarie stirred uneasily at the obvious disappointment and reproach in her\nfriend's voice.\n\n“But, dear, it wouldn't be wise, I'm sure,” she argued hastily. “There\nwill be you and Bertram--”\n\n“We sha'n't be there for a year, nearly,” cut in Billy, with swift\npromptness. “Besides, I think it would be lovely--all together.”\n\nMarie smiled, but she shook her head.\n\n“Lovely--but not practical, dear.”\n\nBilly laughed ruefully.\n\n“I know; you're worrying about those puddings of yours. You're afraid\nsomebody is going to interfere with your making quite so many as you\nwant to; and Cyril is worrying for fear there'll be somebody else in the\ncircle of his shaded lamp besides his little Marie with the light on her\nhair, and the mending basket by her side.”\n\n“Billy, what are you talking about?”\n\nBilly threw a roguish glance into her friend's amazed blue eyes.\n\n“Oh, just a little picture Cyril drew once for me of what home meant for\nhim: a room with a table and a shaded lamp, and a little woman beside it\nwith the light on her hair and a great basket of sewing by her side.”\n\nMarie's eyes softened.\n\n“Did he say--that?”\n\n“Yes. Oh, he declared he shouldn't want her to sit under that lamp all\nthe time, of course; but he hoped she'd like that sort of thing.”\n\nMarie threw a quick glance at the stolid back of John beyond the two\nempty seats in front of them. Although she knew he could not hear her\nwords, instinctively she lowered her voice.\n\n“Did you know--then--about--me?” she asked, with heightened color.\n\n“No, only that there was a girl somewhere who, he hoped, would sit under\nthe lamp some day. And when I asked him if the girl did like that sort\nof thing, he said yes, he thought so; for she had told him once that\nthe things she liked best of all to do were to mend stockings and make\npuddings. Then I knew, of course, 'twas you, for I'd heard you say the\nsame thing. So I sent him right along out to you in the summer-house.”\n\nThe pink flush on Marie's face grew to a red one. Her blue eyes turned\nagain to John's broad back, then drifted to the long, imposing line of\nwindowed walls and doorways on the right. The automobile was passing\nsmoothly along Beacon Street now with the Public Garden just behind them\non the left. After a moment Marie turned to Billy again.\n\n“I'm so glad he wants--just puddings and stockings,” she began a little\nbreathlessly. “You see, for so long I supposed he _wouldn't_ want\nanything but a very brilliant, talented wife who could play and sing\nbeautifully; a wife he'd be proud of--like you.”\n\n“Me? Nonsense!” laughed Billy. “Cyril never wanted me, and I never\nwanted him--only once for a few minutes, so to speak, when I thought,\nI did. In spite of our music, we aren't a mite congenial. I like people\naround; he doesn't. I like to go to plays; he doesn't. He likes rainy\ndays, and I abhor them. Mercy! Life with me for him would be one long\njangling discord, my love, while with you it'll be one long sweet song!”\n\nMarie drew a deep breath. Her eyes were fixed on a point far ahead up\nthe curveless street.\n\n“I hope it will, indeed!” she breathed.\n\nNot until they were almost home did Billy say suddenly:\n\n“Oh, did Cyril write you? A young relative of Aunt Hannah's is coming\nto-morrow to stay a while at the house.”\n\n“Er--yes, Cyril told me,” admitted Marie.\n\nBilly smiled.\n\n“Didn't like it, I suppose; eh?” she queried shrewdly.\n\n“N-no, I'm afraid he didn't--very well. He said she'd be--one more to be\naround.”\n\n“There, what did I tell you?” dimpled Billy. “You can see what you're\ncoming to when you do get that shaded lamp and the mending basket!”\n\nA moment later, coming in sight of the house, Billy saw a tall,\nsmooth-shaven man standing on the porch. The man lifted his hat and\nwaved it gayly, baring a slightly bald head to the sun.\n\n“It's Uncle William--bless his heart!” cried Billy. “They're all coming\nto dinner, then he and Aunt Hannah and Bertram and I are going down to\nthe Hollis Street Theatre and let you and Cyril have a taste of what\nthat shaded lamp is going to be. I hope you won't be lonesome,” she\nfinished mischievously, as the car drew up before the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. AT THE SIGN OF THE PINK\n\n\nAfter a week of beautiful autumn weather, Thursday dawned raw and cold.\nBy noon an east wind had made the temperature still more uncomfortable.\n\nAt two o'clock Aunt Hannah tapped at Billy's chamber door. She showed a\ntroubled face to the girl who answered her knock.\n\n“Billy, _would_ you mind very much if I asked you to go alone to the\nCarletons' and to meet Mary Jane?” she inquired anxiously.\n\n“Why, no--that is, of course I should _mind_, dear, because I always\nlike to have you go to places with me. But it isn't necessary. You\naren't sick; are you?”\n\n“N-no, not exactly; but I have been sneezing all the morning, and taking\ncamphor and sugar to break it up--if it is a cold. But it is so raw and\nNovemberish out, that--”\n\n“Why, of course you sha'n't go, you poor dear! Mercy! don't get one\nof those dreadful colds on to you before the wedding! Have you felt\na draft? Where's another shawl?” Billy turned and cast searching eyes\nabout the room--Billy always kept shawls everywhere for Aunt Hannah's\nshoulders and feet. Bertram had been known to say, indeed, that a room,\naccording to Aunt Hannah, was not fully furnished unless it contained\nfrom one to four shawls, assorted as to size and warmth. Shawls,\ncertainly, did seem to be a necessity with Aunt Hannah, as she usually\nwore from one to three at the same time--which again caused Bertram to\ndeclare that he always counted Aunt Hannah's shawls when he wished to\nknow what the thermometer was.\n\n“No, I'm not cold, and I haven't felt a draft,” said Aunt Hannah now. “I\nput on my thickest gray shawl this morning with the little pink one for\ndown-stairs, and the blue one for breakfast; so you see I've been very\ncareful. But I _have_ sneezed six times, so I think 'twould be safer not\nto go out in this east wind. You were going to stop for Mrs. Granger,\nanyway, weren't you? So you'll have her with you for the tea.”\n\n“Yes, dear, don't worry. I'll take your cards and explain to Mrs.\nCarleton and her daughters.”\n\n“And, of course, as far as Mary Jane is concerned, I don't know her any\nmore than you do; so I couldn't be any help there,” sighed Aunt Hannah.\n\n“Not a bit,” smiled Billy, cheerily. “Don't give it another thought, my\ndear. I sha'n't have a bit of trouble. All I'll have to do is to look\nfor a girl alone with a pink. Of course I'll have mine on, too, and\nshe'll be watching for me. So just run along and take your nap, dear,\nand be all rested and ready to welcome her when she comes,” finished\nBilly, stooping to give the soft, faintly pink cheek a warm kiss.\n\n“Well, thank you, my dear; perhaps I will,” sighed Aunt Hannah, drawing\nthe gray shawl about her as she turned away contentedly.\n\nMrs. Carleton's tea that afternoon was, for Billy, not an occasion of\nunalloyed joy. It was the first time she had appeared at a gathering of\nany size since the announcement of her engagement; and, as she dolefully\ntold Bertram afterwards, she had very much the feeling of the picture\nhung on the wall.\n\n“And they _did_ put up their lorgnettes and say, 'Is _that_ the one?'”\n she declared; “and I know some of them finished with 'Did you ever?'\ntoo,” she sighed.\n\nBut Billy did not stay long in Mrs. Carleton's softly-lighted,\nflower-perfumed rooms. At ten minutes past four she was saying good-by\nto a group of friends who were vainly urging her to remain longer.\n\n“I can't--I really can't,” she declared. “I'm due at the South Station\nat half past four to meet a Miss Arkwright, a young cousin of Aunt\nHannah's, whom I've never seen before. We're to meet at the sign of\nthe pink,” she explained smilingly, just touching the single flower she\nwore.\n\nHer hostess gave a sudden laugh.\n\n“Let me see, my dear; if I remember rightly, you've had experience\nbefore, meeting at this sign of the pink. At least, I have a very vivid\nrecollection of Mr. William Henshaw's going once to meet a _boy_ with\na pink, who turned out to be a girl. Now, to even things up, your girl\nshould turn out to be a boy!”\n\nBilly smiled and reddened.\n\n“Perhaps--but I don't think to-day will strike the balance,” she\nretorted, backing toward the door. “This young lady's name is 'Mary\nJane'; and I'll leave it to you to find anything very masculine in\nthat!”\n\nIt was a short drive from Mrs. Carleton's Commonwealth Avenue home to\nthe South Station, and Peggy made as quick work of it as the narrow,\ncongested cross streets would allow. In ample time Billy found herself\nin the great waiting-room, with John saying respectfully in her ear:\n\n“The man says the train comes in on Track Fourteen, Miss, an' it's on\ntime.”\n\nAt twenty-nine minutes past four Billy left her seat and walked down the\ntrain-shed platform to Track Number Fourteen. She had pinned the pink\nnow to the outside of her long coat, and it made an attractive dash\nof white against the dark-blue velvet. Billy was looking particularly\nlovely to-day. Framing her face was the big dark-blue velvet picture hat\nwith its becoming white plumes.\n\nDuring the brief minutes' wait before the clanging locomotive puffed\ninto view far down the long track, Billy's thoughts involuntarily went\nback to that other watcher beside a train gate not quite five years\nbefore.\n\n“Dear Uncle William!” she murmured tenderly. Then suddenly she\nlaughed--so nearly aloud that a man behind her gave her a covert glance\nfrom curious eyes. “My! but what a jolt I must have been to Uncle\nWilliam!” Billy was thinking.\n\nThe next minute she drew nearer the gate and regarded with absorbed\nattention the long line of passengers already sweeping up the narrow\naisle between the cars.\n\nHurrying men came first, with long strides, and eyes that looked\nstraight ahead. These Billy let pass with a mere glance. The next group\nshowed a sprinkling of women--women whose trig hats and linen collars\nspelled promptness as well as certainty of aim and accomplishment. To\nthese, also, Billy paid scant attention. Couples came next--the men\nanxious-eyed, and usually walking two steps ahead of their companions;\nthe women plainly flustered and hurried, and invariably buttoning gloves\nor gathering up trailing ends of scarfs or boas.\n\nThe crowd was thickening fast, now, and Billy's eyes were alert.\nChildren were appearing, and young women walking alone. One of these\nwore a bunch of violets. Billy gave her a second glance. Then she saw a\npink--but it was on the coat lapel of a tall young fellow with a brown\nbeard; so with a slight frown she looked beyond down the line.\n\nOld men came now, and old women; fleshy women, and women with small\nchildren and babies. Couples came, too--dawdling couples, plainly newly\nmarried: the men were not two steps ahead, and the women's gloves were\nbuttoned and their furs in place.\n\nGradually the line thinned, and soon there were left only an old man\nwith a cane, and a young woman with three children. Yet nowhere had\nBilly seen a girl wearing a white carnation, and walking alone.\n\nWith a deeper frown on her face Billy turned and looked about her. She\nthought that somewhere in the crowd she had missed Mary Jane, and that\nshe would find her now, standing near. But there was no one standing\nnear except the good-looking young fellow with the little pointed\nbrown beard, who, as Billy noticed a second time, was wearing a white\ncarnation.\n\nAs she glanced toward him, their eyes met. Then, to Billy's unbounded\namazement, the man advanced with uplifted hat.\n\n“I beg your pardon, but is not this--Miss Neilson?”\n\nBilly drew back with just a touch of hauteur.\n\n“Y-yes,” she murmured.\n\n“I thought so--yet I was expecting to see you with Aunt Hannah. I am M.\nJ. Arkwright, Miss Neilson.”\n\nFor a brief instant Billy stared dazedly.\n\n“You don't mean--Mary Jane?” she gasped.\n\n“I'm afraid I do.” His lips twitched.\n\n“But I thought--we were expecting--” She stopped helplessly. For one\nmore brief instant she stared; then, suddenly, a swift change came to\nher face. Her eyes danced.\n\n“Oh--oh!” she chuckled. “How perfectly funny! You _have_ evened things\nup, after all. To think that Mary Jane should be a--” She paused and\nflashed almost angrily suspicious eyes into his face. “But mine _was_\n'Billy,'” she cried. “Your name isn't really--Mary Jane'?”\n\n“I am often called that.” His brown eyes twinkled, but they did not\nswerve from their direct gaze into her own.\n\n“But--” Billy hesitated, and turned her eyes away. She saw then that\nmany curious glances were already being flung in her direction. The\ncolor in her cheeks deepened. With an odd little gesture she seemed to\ntoss something aside. “Never mind,” she laughed a little hysterically.\n“If you'll pick up your bag, please, Mr. Mary Jane, and come with me.\nJohn and Peggy are waiting. Or--I forgot--you have a trunk, of course?”\n\nThe man raised a protesting hand.\n\n“Thank you; but, Miss Neilson, really--I couldn't think of trespassing\non your hospitality--now, you know.”\n\n“But we--we invited you,” stammered Billy.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“You invited _Miss_ Mary Jane.”\n\nBilly bubbled into low laughter.\n\n“I beg your pardon, but it _is_ funny,” she sighed. “You see _I_ came\nonce just the same way, and now to have the tables turned like this!\nWhat will Aunt Hannah say--what will everybody say? Come, I want them to\nbegin--to say it,” she chuckled irrepressibly.\n\n“Thank you, but I shall go to a hotel, of course. Later, if you'll be so\ngood as to let me call, and explain--!”\n\n“But I'm afraid Aunt Hannah will think--” Billy stopped abruptly. Some\ndistance away she saw John coming toward them. She turned hurriedly to\nthe man at her side. Her eyes still danced, but her voice was mockingly\nserious. “Really, Mr. Mary Jane, I'm afraid you'll have to come to\ndinner; then you can settle the rest with Aunt Hannah. John is almost\nupon us--and _I_ don't want to make explanations. Do you?”\n\n“John,” she said airily to the somewhat dazed chauffeur (who had been\ntold he was to meet a young woman), “take Mr. Arkwright's bag, please,\nand show him where Peggy is waiting. It will be five minutes, perhaps,\nbefore I can come--if you'll kindly excuse me,” she added to Arkwright,\nwith a flashing glance from merry eyes. “I have some--telephoning to\ndo.”\n\nAll the way to the telephone booth Billy was trying to bring order out\nof the chaos of her mind; but all the way, too, she was chuckling.\n\n“To think that this thing should have happened to _me!_” she\nsaid, almost aloud. “And here I am telephoning just like Uncle\nWilliam--Bertram said Uncle William _did_ telephone about _me!_”\n\nIn due course Billy had Aunt Hannah at the other end of the wire.\n\n“Aunt Hannah, listen. I'd never have believed it, but it's happened.\nMary Jane is--a man.”\n\nBilly heard a dismayed gasp and a muttered “Oh, my grief and\nconscience!” then a shaking “Wha-at?”\n\n“I say, Mary Jane is a man.” Billy was enjoying herself hugely.\n\n“A _ma-an!_”\n\n“Yes; a great big man with a brown beard. He's waiting now with John and\nI must go.”\n\n“But, Billy, I don't understand,” chattered an agitated voice over the\nline. “He--he called himself 'Mary Jane.' He hasn't any business to be\na big man with a brown beard! What shall we do? We don't want a big man\nwith a brown beard--here!”\n\nBilly laughed roguishly.\n\n“I don't know. _You_ asked him! How he will like that little blue\nroom--Aunt Hannah!” Billy's voice turned suddenly tragic. “For pity's\nsake take out those curling tongs and hairpins, and the work-basket.\nI'd _never_ hear the last of it if he saw those, I know. He's just that\nkind!”\n\nA half stifled groan came over the wire.\n\n“Billy, he can't stay here.”\n\nBilly laughed again.\n\n“No, no, dear; he won't, I know. He says he's going to a hotel. But\nI had to bring him home to dinner; there was no other way, under the\ncircumstances. He won't stay. Don't you worry. But good-by. I must\ngo. _Remember those curling tongs!_” And the receiver clicked sharply\nagainst the hook.\n\nIn the automobile some minutes later, Billy and Mr. M. J. Arkwright\nwere speeding toward Corey Hill. It was during a slight pause in the\nconversation that Billy turned to her companion with a demure:\n\n“I telephoned Aunt Hannah, Mr. Arkwright. I thought she ought to\nbe--warned.”\n\n“You are very kind. What did she say?--if I may ask.”\n\nThere was a brief moment of hesitation before Billy answered.\n\n“She said you called yourself 'Mary Jane,' and that you hadn't any\nbusiness to be a big man with a brown beard.”\n\nArkwright laughed.\n\n“I'm afraid I owe Aunt Hannah an apology,” he said. He hesitated,\nglanced admiringly at the glowing, half-averted face near him, then went\non decisively. He wore the air of a man who has set the match to his\nbridges. “I signed both letters 'M. J. Arkwright,' but in the first one\nI quoted a remark of a friend, and in that remark I was addressed as\n'Mary Jane.' I did not know but Aunt Hannah knew of the nickname.”\n (Arkwright was speaking a little slowly now, as if weighing his words.)\n“But when she answered, I saw that she did not; for, from something she\nsaid, I realized that she thought I was a real Mary Jane. For the joke\nof the thing I let it pass. But--if she noticed my letter carefully, she\nsaw that I did not accept your kind invitation to give 'Mary Jane' a\nhome.”\n\n“Yes, we noticed that,” nodded Billy, merrily. “But we didn't think you\nmeant it. You see we pictured you as a shy young thing. But, really,”\n she went on with a low laugh, “you see your coming as a masculine 'Mary\nJane' was particularly funny--for me; for, though perhaps you didn't\nknow it, I came once to this very same city, wearing a pink, and was\nexpected to be Billy, a boy. And only to-day a lady warned me that\nyour coming might even things up. But I didn't believe it would--a Mary\nJane!”\n\nArkwright laughed. Again he hesitated, and seemed to be weighing his\nwords.\n\n“Yes, I heard about that coming of yours. I might almost say--that's why\nI--let the mistake pass in Aunt Hannah's letter,” he said.\n\nBilly turned with reproachful eyes.\n\n“Oh, how could--you? But then--it was a temptation!” She laughed\nsuddenly. “What sinful joy you must have had watching me hunt for 'Mary\nJane.'”\n\n“I didn't,” acknowledged the other, with unexpected candor. “I\nfelt--ashamed. And when I saw you were there alone without Aunt Hannah,\nI came very near not speaking at all--until I realized that that would\nbe even worse, under the circumstances.”\n\n“Of course it would,” smiled Billy, brightly; “so I don't see but I\nshall have to forgive you, after all. And here we are at home, Mr. Mary\nJane. By the way, what did you say that 'M. J.' did stand for?” she\nasked, as the car came to a stop.\n\nThe man did not seem to hear; at least he did not answer. He was\nhelping his hostess to alight. A moment later a plainly agitated Aunt\nHannah--her gray shawl topped with a huge black one--opened the door of\nthe house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. OLD FRIENDS AND NEW\n\n\nAt ten minutes before six on the afternoon of Arkwright's arrival, Billy\ncame into the living-room to welcome the three Henshaw brothers, who, as\nwas frequently the case, were dining at Hillside.\n\nBertram thought Billy had never looked prettier than she did this\nafternoon with the bronze sheen of her pretty house gown bringing\nout the bronze lights in her dark eyes and in the soft waves of her\nbeautiful hair. Her countenance, too, carried a peculiar something that\nthe artist's eye was quick to detect, and that the artist's fingers\ntingled to put on canvas.\n\n“Jove! Billy,” he said low in her ear, as he greeted her, “I wish I had\na brush in my hand this minute. I'd have a 'Face of a Girl' that would\nbe worth while!”\n\nBilly laughed and dimpled her appreciation; but down in her heart she\nwas conscious of a vague unrest. Billy wished, sometimes, that she did\nnot so often seem to Bertram--a picture.\n\nShe turned to Cyril with outstretched hand.\n\n“Oh, yes, Marie's coming,” she smiled in answer to the quick shifting\nof Cyril's eyes to the hall doorway. “And Aunt Hannah, too. They're\nup-stairs.”\n\n“And Mary Jane?” demanded William, a little anxiously\n\n“Will's getting nervous,” volunteered Bertram, airily. “He wants to see\nMary Jane. You see we've told him that we shall expect him to see that\nshe doesn't bother us four too much, you know. He's expected always to\nremove her quietly but effectually, whenever he sees that she is likely\nto interrupt a tête-á-tête. Naturally, then, Will wants to see\nMary Jane.”\n\nBilly began to laugh hysterically. She dropped into a chair and raised\nboth her hands, palms outward.\n\n“Don't, don't--please don't!” she choked, “or I shall die. I've had all\nI can stand, already.”\n\n“All you can stand?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Is she so--impossible?” This last was from Bertram, spoken softly, and\nwith a hurried glance toward the hall.\n\nBilly dropped her hands and lifted her head. By heroic effort she pulled\nher face into sobriety--all but her eyes--and announced:\n\n“Mary Jane is--a man.”\n\n“Wha-at?”\n\n“A _man!_”\n\n“Billy!”\n\nThree masculine forms sat suddenly erect.\n\n“Yes. Oh, Uncle William, I know now just how you felt--I know, I know,”\n gurgled Billy, incoherently. “There he stood with his pink just as I\ndid--only he had a brown beard, and he didn't have Spunk--and I had to\ntelephone to prepare folks, just as you did. And the room--the room!\nI fixed the room, too,” she babbled breathlessly, “only I had curling\ntongs and hair pins in it instead of guns and spiders!”\n\n“Child, child! what _are_ you talking about?” William's face was red.\n\n“A _man!_--_Mary Jane!_” Cyril was merely cross.\n\n“Billy, what does this mean?” Bertram had grown a little white.\n\nBilly began to laugh again, yet she was plainly trying to control\nherself.\n\n“I'll tell you. I must tell you. Aunt Hannah is keeping him up-stairs\nso I can tell you,” she panted. “But it was so funny, when I expected a\ngirl, you know, to see him with his brown beard, and he was so tall and\nbig! And, of course, it made me think how _I_ came, and was a girl when\nyou expected a boy; and Mrs. Carleton had just said to-day that maybe\nthis girl would even things up. Oh, it was so funny!”\n\n“Billy, my-my dear,” remonstrated Uncle William, mildly.\n\n“But what _is_ his name?” demanded Cyril.\n\n“Did the creature sign himself 'Mary Jane'?” exploded Bertram.\n\n“I don't know his name, except that it's 'M. J.'--and that's how he\nsigned the letters. But he _is_ called 'Mary Jane' sometimes, and in the\nletter he quoted somebody's speech--I've forgotten just how--but in it\nhe was called 'Mary Jane,' and, of course, Aunt Hannah took him for a\ngirl,” explained Billy, grown a little more coherent now.\n\n“Didn't he write again?” asked William.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, why didn't he correct the mistake, then?” demanded Bertram.\n\nBilly chuckled.\n\n“He didn't want to, I guess. He thought it was too good a joke.”\n\n“Joke!” scoffed Cyril.\n\n“But, see here, Billy, he isn't going to live here--now?” Bertram's\nvoice was almost savage.\n\n“Oh, no, he isn't going to live here--now,” interposed smooth tones from\nthe doorway.\n\n“Mr.--Arkwright!” breathed Billy, confusedly.\n\nThree crimson-faced men sprang to their feet. The situation, for a\nmoment, threatened embarrassed misery for all concerned; but Arkwright,\nwith a cheery smile, advanced straight toward Bertram, and held out a\nfriendly hand.\n\n“The proverbial fate of listeners,” he said easily; “but I don't blame\nyou at all. No, 'he' isn't going to live here,” he went on, grasping\neach brother's hand in turn, as Billy murmured faint introductions; “and\nwhat is more, he hereby asks everybody's pardon for the annoyance his\nlittle joke has caused. He might add that he's heartily-ashamed of\nhimself, as well; but if any of you--” Arkwright turned to the three\ntall men still standing by their chairs--“if any of you had suffered\nwhat he has at the hands of a swarm of youngsters for that name's sake,\nyou wouldn't blame him for being tempted to get what fun he could out of\nMary Jane--if there ever came a chance!”\n\nNaturally, after this, there could be nothing stiff or embarrassing.\nBilly laughed in relief, and motioned Mr. Arkwright to a seat near her.\nWilliam said “Of course, of course!” and shook hands again. Bertram and\nCyril laughed shamefacedly and sat down. Somebody said: “But what does\nthe 'M. J.' stand for, anyhow?” Nobody answered this, however; perhaps\nbecause Aunt Hannah and Marie appeared just then in the doorway.\n\nDinner proved to be a lively meal. In the newcomer, Bertram met his\nmatch for wit and satire; and “Mr. Mary Jane,” as he was promptly called\nby every one but Aunt Hannah, was found to be a most entertaining guest.\n\nAfter dinner somebody suggested music.\n\nCyril frowned, and got up abruptly. Still frowning, he turned to a\nbookcase near him and began to take down and examine some of the books.\n\nBertram twinkled and glanced at Billy.\n\n“Which is it, Cyril?” he called with cheerful impertinence; “stool,\npiano, or audience that is the matter to-night?”\n\nOnly a shrug from Cyril answered.\n\n“You see,” explained Bertram, jauntily, to Arkwright, whose eyes were\nslightly puzzled, “Cyril never plays unless the piano and the pedals and\nthe weather and your ears and my watch and his fingers are just right!”\n\n“Nonsense!” scorned Cyril, dropping his book and walking back to his\nchair. “I don't feel like playing to-night; that's all.”\n\n“You see,” nodded Bertram again.\n\n“I see,” bowed Arkwright with quiet amusement.\n\n“I believe--Mr. Mary Jane--sings,” observed Billy, at this point,\ndemurely.\n\n“Why, yes, of course,” chimed in Aunt Hannah with some nervousness.\n“That's what she--I mean he--was coming to Boston for--to study music.”\n\nEverybody laughed.\n\n“Won't you sing, please?” asked Billy. “Can you--without your notes? I\nhave lots of songs if you want them.”\n\nFor a moment--but only a moment--Arkwright hesitated; then he rose and\nwent to the piano.\n\nWith the easy sureness of the trained musician his fingers dropped to\nthe keys and slid into preliminary chords and arpeggios to test the\ntouch of the piano; then, with a sweetness and purity that made every\nlistener turn in amazed delight, a well-trained tenor began the “Thro'\nthe leaves the night winds moving,” of Schubert's Serenade.\n\nCyril's chin had lifted at the first tone. He was listening now with\nvery obvious pleasure. Bertram, too, was showing by his attitude the\nkeenest appreciation. William and Aunt Hannah, resting back in their\nchairs, were contentedly nodding their approval to each other. Marie in\nher corner was motionless with rapture. As to Billy--Billy was plainly\noblivious of everything but the song and the singer. She seemed scarcely\nto move or to breathe till the song's completion; then there came a low\n“Oh, how beautiful!” through her parted lips.\n\nBertram, looking at her, was conscious of a vague irritation.\n\n“Arkwright, you're a lucky dog,” he declared almost crossly. “I wish I\ncould sing like that!”\n\n“I wish I could paint a 'Face of a Girl,'” smiled the tenor as he turned\nfrom the piano.\n\n“Oh, but, Mr. Arkwright, don't stop,” objected Billy, springing to her\nfeet and going to her music cabinet by the piano. “There's a little song\nof Nevin's I want you to sing. There, here it is. Just let me play it\nfor you.” And she slipped into the place the singer had just left.\n\nIt was the beginning of the end. After Nevin came De Koven, and after\nDe Koven, Gounod. Then came Nevin again, Billy still playing the\naccompaniment. Next followed a duet. Billy did not consider herself much\nof a singer, but her voice was sweet and true, and not without training.\nIt blended very prettily with the clear, pure tenor.\n\nWilliam and Aunt Hannah still smiled contentedly in their chairs, though\nAunt Hannah had reached for the pink shawl near her--the music had sent\nlittle shivers down her spine. Cyril, with Marie, had slipped into the\nlittle reception-room across the hall, ostensibly to look at some plans\nfor a house, although--as everybody knew--they were not intending to\nbuild for a year.\n\nBertram, still sitting stiffly erect in his chair, was not conscious\nof a vague irritation now. He was conscious of a very real, and a very\ndecided one--an irritation that was directed against himself, against\nBilly, and against this man, Arkwright; but chiefly against music,\n_per se_. He hated music. He wished he could sing. He wondered how long\nit took to teach a man to sing, anyhow; and he wondered if a man could\nsing--who never had sung.\n\nAt this point the duet came to an end, and Billy and her guest left\nthe piano. Almost at once, after this, Arkwright made his very graceful\nadieus, and went off with his suit-case to the hotel where, as he had\ninformed Aunt Hannah, his room was already engaged.\n\nWilliam went home then, and Aunt Hannah went up-stairs. Cyril and Marie\nwithdrew into a still more secluded corner to look at their plans, and\nBertram found himself at last alone with Billy. He forgot, then, in\nthe blissful hour he spent with her before the open fire, how he hated\nmusic; though he did say, just before he went home that night:\n\n“Billy, how long does it take--to learn to sing?”\n\n“Why, I don't know, I'm sure,” replied Billy, abstractedly; then, with\nsudden fervor: “Oh, Bertram, hasn't Mr. Mary Jane a beautiful voice?”\n\nBertram wished then he had not asked the question; but all he said was:\n\n“'Mr. Mary Jane,' indeed! What an absurd name!”\n\n“But doesn't he sing beautifully?”\n\n“Eh? Oh, yes, he sings all right,” said Bertram's tongue. Bertram's\nmanner said: “Oh, yes, anybody can sing.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. M. J. OPENS THE GAME\n\n\nOn the morning after Cyril's first concert of the season, Billy sat\nsewing with Aunt Hannah in the little sitting-room at the end of the\nhall upstairs. Aunt Hannah wore only one shawl this morning,--which\nmeant that she was feeling unusually well.\n\n“Marie ought to be here to mend these stockings,” remarked Billy, as she\ncritically examined a tiny break in the black silk mesh stretched across\nthe darning-egg in her hand; “only she'd want a bigger hole. She does so\nlove to make a beautiful black latticework bridge across a yawning white\nchina sea--and you'd think the safety of an army depended on the way\neach plank was laid, too,” she concluded.\n\nAunt Hannah smiled tranquilly, but she did not speak.\n\n“I suppose you don't happen to know if Cyril does wear big holes in his\nsocks,” resumed Billy, after a moment's silence. “If you'll believe it,\nthat thought popped into my head last night when Cyril was playing\nthat concerto so superbly. It did, actually--right in the middle of the\nadagio movement, too. And in spite of my joy and pride in the music I\nhad all I could do to keep from nudging Marie right there and then and\nasking her whether or not the dear man was hard on his hose.”\n\n“Billy!” gasped the shocked Aunt Hannah; but the gasp broke at once into\nwhat--in Aunt Hannah--passed for a chuckle. “If I remember rightly, when\nI was there at the house with you at first, my dear, William told me\nthat Cyril wouldn't wear any sock after it came to mending.”\n\n“Horrors!” Billy waved her stocking in mock despair. “That will never\ndo in the world. It would break Marie's heart. You know how she dotes on\ndarning.”\n\n“Yes, I know,” smiled Aunt Hannah. “By the way, where is she this\nmorning?”\n\nBilly raised her eyebrows quizzically.\n\n“Gone to look at an apartment in Cambridge, I believe. Really,\nAunt Hannah, between her home-hunting in the morning, and her\nfurniture-and-rug hunting in the afternoon, and her poring over\nhouse-plans in the evening, I can't get her to attend to her clothes at\nall. Never did I see a bride so utterly indifferent to her trousseau as\nMarie Hawthorn--and her wedding less than a month away!”\n\n“But she's been shopping with you once or twice, since she came back,\nhasn't she? And she said it was for her trousseau.”\n\nBilly laughed.\n\n“Her trousseau! Oh, yes, it was. I'll tell you what she got for her\ntrousseau that first day. We started out to buy two hats, some lace for\nher wedding gown, some crêpe de Chine and net for a little dinner\nfrock, and some silk for a couple of waists to go with her tailored\nsuit; and what did we get? We purchased a new-style egg-beater and a\nset of cake tins. Marie got into the kitchen department and I simply\ncouldn't get her out of it. But the next day I was not to be inveigled\nbelow stairs by any plaintive prayer for a nutmeg-grater or a soda\nspoon. She _shopped_ that day, and to some purpose. We accomplished\nlots.”\n\nAunt Hannah looked a little concerned.\n\n“But she must have _some_ things started!”\n\n“Oh, she has--'most everything now. _I've_ seen to that. Of course her\noutfit is very simple, anyway. Marie hasn't much money, you know, and\nshe simply won't let me do half what I want to. Still, she had saved\nup some money, and I've finally convinced her that a trousseau doesn't\nconsist of egg-beaters and cake tins, and that Cyril would want her to\nlook pretty. That name will fetch her every time, and I've learned to\nuse it beautifully. I think if I told her Cyril approved of short hair\nand near-sightedness she'd I cut off her golden locks and don spectacles\non the spot.”\n\nAunt Hannah laughed softly.\n\n“What a child you are, Billy! Besides, just as if Marie were the only\none in the house who is ruled by a magic name!”\n\nThe color deepened in Billy's cheeks.\n\n“Well, of course, any girl--cares something--for the man she loves. Just\nas if I wouldn't do anything in the world I could for Bertram!”\n\n“Oh, that makes me think; who was that young woman Bertram was talking\nwith last evening--just after he left us, I mean?”\n\n“Miss Winthrop--Miss Marguerite Winthrop. Bertram is--is painting her\nportrait, you know.”\n\n“Oh, is that the one?” murmured Aunt Hannah. “Hm-m; well, she has a\nbeautiful face.”\n\n“Yes, she has.” Billy spoke very cheerfully. She even hummed a little\ntune as she carefully selected a needle from the cushion in her basket.\n\n“There's a peculiar something in her face,” mused Aunt Hannah, aloud.\n\nThe little tune stopped abruptly, ending in a nervous laugh.\n\n“Dear me! I wonder how it feels to have a peculiar something in your\nface. Bertram, too, says she has it. He's trying to 'catch it,' he says.\nI wonder now--if he does catch it, does she lose it?” Flippant as were\nthe words, the voice that uttered them shook a little.\n\nAunt Hannah smiled indulgently--Aunt Hannah had heard only the\nflippancy, not the shake.\n\n“I don't know, my dear. You might ask him this afternoon.”\n\nBilly made a sudden movement. The china egg in her lap rolled to the\nfloor.\n\n“Oh, but I don't see him this afternoon,” she said lightly, as she\nstooped to pick up the egg.\n\n“Why, I'm sure he told me--” Aunt Hannah's sentence ended in a\nquestioning pause.\n\n“Yes, I know,” nodded Billy, brightly; “but he's told me something\nsince. He isn't going. He telephoned me this morning. Miss Winthrop\nwanted the sitting changed from to-morrow to this afternoon. He said he\nknew I'd understand.”\n\n“Why, yes; but--” Aunt Hannah did not finish her sentence. The whir of\nan electric bell had sounded through the house. A few moments later Rosa\nappeared in the open doorway.\n\n“It's Mr. Arkwright, Miss. He said as how he had brought the music,”\n she announced.\n\n“Tell him I'll be down at once,” directed the mistress of Hillside.\n\nAs the maid disappeared, Billy put aside her work and sprang lightly to\nher feet.\n\n“Now wasn't that nice of him? We were talking last night about some\nduets he had, and he said he'd bring them over. I didn't know he'd come\nso soon, though.”\n\nBilly had almost reached the bottom of the stairway, when a low,\nfamiliar strain of music drifted out from the living-room. Billy caught\nher breath, and held her foot suspended. The next moment the familiar\nstrain of music had become a lullaby--one of Billy's own--and sung now\nby a melting tenor voice that lingered caressingly and understandingly\non every tender cadence.\n\nMotionless and almost breathless, Billy waited until the last\nlow “lul-la-by” vibrated into silence; then with shining eyes and\noutstretched hands she entered the living-room.\n\n“Oh, that was--beautiful,” she breathed.\n\nArkwright was on his feet instantly. His eyes, too, were alight.\n\n“I could not resist singing it just once--here,” he said a little\nunsteadily, as their hands met.\n\n“But to hear my little song sung like that! I couldn't believe it was\nmine,” choked Billy, still plainly very much moved. “You sang it as I've\nnever heard it sung before.”\n\nArkwright shook his head slowly.\n\n“The inspiration of the room--that is all,”, he said. “It is a beautiful\nsong. All of your songs are beautiful.”\n\nBilly blushed rosily.\n\n“Thank you. You know--more of them, then?”\n\n“I think I know them all--unless you have some new ones out. Have you\nsome new ones, lately?”\n\nBilly shook her head.\n\n“No; I haven't written anything since last spring.”\n\n“But you're going to?”\n\nShe drew a long sigh.\n\n“Yes, oh, yes. I know that _now_--” With a swift biting of her lower\nlip Billy caught herself up in time. As if she could tell this man, this\nstranger, what she had told Bertram that night by the fire--that she\nknew that now, _now_ she would write beautiful songs, with his love, and\nhis pride in her, as incentives. “Oh, yes, I think I shall write more\none of these days,” she finished lightly. “But come, this isn't singing\nduets! I want to see the music you brought.”\n\nThey sang then, one after another of the duets. To Billy, the music was\nnew and interesting. To Billy, too, it was new (and interesting) to hear\nher own voice blending with another's so perfectly--to feel herself a\npart of such exquisite harmony.\n\n“Oh, oh!” she breathed ecstatically, after the last note of a\nparticularly beautiful phrase. “I never knew before how lovely it was to\nsing duets.”\n\n“Nor I,” replied Arkwright in a voice that was not quite steady.\n\nArkwright's eyes were on the enraptured face of the girl so near him.\nIt was well, perhaps, that Billy did not happen to turn and catch their\nexpression. Still, it might have been better if she had turned, after\nall. But Billy's eyes were on the music before her. Her fingers were\nbusy with the fluttering pages, searching for another duet.\n\n“Didn't you?” she murmured abstractedly. “I supposed _you'd_ sung them\nbefore; but you see I never did--until the other night. There, let's try\nthis one!”\n\n“This one” was followed by another and another. Then Billy drew a long\nbreath.\n\n“There! that must positively be the last,” she declared reluctantly.\n“I'm so hoarse now I can scarcely croak. You see, I don't pretend to\nsing, really.”\n\n“Don't you? You sing far better than some who do, anyhow,” retorted the\nman, warmly.\n\n“Thank you,” smiled Billy; “that was nice of you to say so--for my\nsake--and the others aren't here to care. But tell me of yourself. I\nhaven't had a chance to ask you yet; and--I think you said Mary Jane was\ngoing to study for Grand Opera.”\n\nArkwright laughed and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“She is; but, as I told Calderwell, she's quite likely to bring up in\nvaudeville.”\n\n“Calderwell! Do you mean--Hugh Calderwell?” Billy's cheeks showed a\ndeeper color.\n\nThe man gave an embarrassed little laugh. He had not meant to let that\nname slip out just yet.\n\n“Yes.” He hesitated, then plunged on recklessly. “We tramped half over\nEurope together last summer.”\n\n“Did you?” Billy left her seat at the piano for one nearer the fire.\n“But this isn't telling me about your own plans,” she hurried on a\nlittle precipitately. “You've studied before, of course. Your voice\nshows that.”\n\n“Oh, yes; I've studied singing several years, and I've had a year or two\nof church work, besides a little concert practice of a mild sort.”\n\n“Have you begun here, yet?”\n\n“Y-yes, I've had my voice tried.”\n\nBilly sat erect with eager interest.\n\n“They liked it, of course?”\n\nArkwright laughed.\n\n“I'm not saying that.”\n\n“No, but I am,” declared Billy, with conviction. “They couldn't help\nliking it.”\n\nArkwright laughed again. Just how well they had “liked it” he did not\nintend to say. Their remarks had been quite too flattering to repeat\neven to this very plainly interested young woman--delightful and\nheart-warming as was this same show of interest, to himself.\n\n“Thank you,” was all he said.\n\nBilly gave an excited little bounce in her chair.\n\n“And you'll begin to learn rôles right away?”\n\n“I already have, some--after a fashion--before I came here.”\n\n“Really? How splendid! Why, then you'll be acting them next right on the\nBoston Opera House stage, and we'll all go to hear you. How perfectly\nlovely! I can hardly wait.”\n\nArkwright laughed--but his eyes glowed with pleasure.\n\n“Aren't you hurrying things a little?” he ventured.\n\n“But they do let the students appear,” argued Billy. “I knew a girl last\nyear who went on in 'Aida,' and she was a pupil at the School. She sang\nfirst in a Sunday concert, then they put her in the bill for a Saturday\nnight. She did splendidly--so well that they gave her a chance later at\na subscription performance. Oh, you'll be there--and soon, too!”\n\n“Thank you! I only wish the powers that could put me there had your\nflattering enthusiasm on the matter,” he smiled.\n\n“I don't worry any,” nodded Billy, “only please don't 'arrive' too\nsoon--not before the wedding, you know,” she added jokingly. “We shall\nbe too busy to give you proper attention until after that.”\n\nA peculiar look crossed Arkwright's face.\n\n“The--_wedding?_” he asked, a little faintly.\n\n“Yes. Didn't you know? My friend, Miss Hawthorn, is to marry Mr. Cyril\nHenshaw next month.”\n\nThe man opposite relaxed visibly.\n\n“Oh, _Miss Hawthorn!_ No, I didn't know,” he murmured; then, with sudden\nastonishment he added: “And to Mr. Cyril, the musician, did you say?”\n\n“Yes. You seem surprised.”\n\n“I am.” Arkwright paused, then went on almost defiantly. “You see,\nCalderwell was telling me only last September how very unmarriageable\nall the Henshaw brothers were. So I am surprised--naturally,” finished\nArkwright, as he rose to take his leave.\n\nA swift crimson stained Billy's face.\n\n“But surely you must know that--that--”\n\n“That he has a right to change his mind, of course,” supplemented\nArkwright smilingly, coming to her rescue in the evident confusion\nthat would not let her finish her sentence. “But Calderwell made it so\nemphatic, you see, about all the brothers. He said that William had lost\nhis heart long ago; that Cyril hadn't any to lose; and that Bertram--”\n\n“But, Mr. Arkwright, Bertram is--is--” Billy had moistened her lips, and\nplunged hurriedly in to prevent Arkwright's next words. But again was\nshe unable to finish her sentence, and again was she forced to listen\nto a very different completion from the smiling lips of the man at her\nside.\n\n“Is an artist, of course,” said Arkwright. “That's what Calderwell\ndeclared--that it would always be the tilt of a chin or the curve of a\ncheek that the artist loved--to paint.”\n\nBilly drew back suddenly. Her face paled. As if _now_ she could tell\nthis man that Bertram Henshaw was engaged to her! He would find it out\nsoon, of course, for himself; and perhaps he, like Hugh Calderwell,\nwould think it was the curve of _her_ cheek, or the tilt of _her_ chin--\n\nBilly lifted her chin very defiantly now as she held out her hand in\ngood-by.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. A RUG, A PICTURE, AND A GIRL AFRAID\n\n\nThanksgiving came. Once again the Henshaw brothers invited Billy and\nAunt Hannah to spend the day with them. This time, however, there was to\nbe an additional guest present in the person of Marie Hawthorn.\n\nAnd what a day it was, for everything and everybody concerned! First\nthe Strata itself: from Dong Ling's kitchen in the basement to Cyril's\ndomain on the top floor, the house was as spick-and-span as Pete's eager\nold hands could make it. In the drawing-room and in Bertram's den and\nstudio, great clusters of pink roses perfumed the air, and brightened\nthe sombre richness of the old-time furnishings. Before the open fire in\nthe den a sleek gray cat--adorned with a huge ribbon bow the exact shade\nof the roses (Bertram had seen to that!)--winked and blinked sleepy\nyellow eyes. In Bertram's studio the latest “Face of a Girl” had made\nway for a group of canvases and plaques, every one of which showed Billy\nNeilson in one pose or another. Up-stairs, where William's chaos of\ntreasures filled shelves and cabinets, the place of honor was given to\na small black velvet square on which rested a pair of quaint Battersea\nenamel mirror knobs. In Cyril's rooms--usually so austerely bare--a\nhandsome Oriental rug and several curtain-draped chairs hinted at\npurchases made at the instigation of a taste other than his own.\n\nWhen the doorbell rang Pete admitted the ladies with a promptness that\nwas suggestive of surreptitious watching at some window. On Pete's\nface the dignity of his high office and the delight of the moment were\nfighting for mastery. The dignity held firmly through Mrs. Stetson's\nfriendly greeting; but it fled in defeat when Billy Neilson stepped over\nthe threshold with a cheery “Good morning, Pete.”\n\n“Laws! But it's good to be seein' you here again,” stammered the\nman,--delight now in sole possession.\n\n“She'll be coming to stay, one of these days, Pete,” smiled the eldest\nHenshaw, hurrying forward.\n\n“I wish she had now,” whispered Bertram, who, in spite of William's\nquick stride, had reached Billy's side first.\n\nFrom the stairway came the patter of a man's slippered feet.\n\n“The rug has come, and the curtains, too,” called a “householder” sort\nof voice that few would have recognized as belonging to Cyril Henshaw.\n“You must all come up-stairs and see them after dinner.” The voice,\napparently, spoke to everybody; but the eyes of the owner of the voice\nplainly saw only the fair-haired young woman who stood a little in the\nshadow behind Billy, and who was looking about her now as at something a\nlittle fearsome, but very dear.\n\n“You know--I've never been--where you live--before,” explained Marie\nHawthorn in a low, vibrant tone, when Cyril bent over her to take the\nfurs from her shoulders.\n\nIn Bertram's den a little later, as hosts and guests advanced toward\nthe fire, the sleek gray cat rose, stretched lazily, and turned her head\nwith majestic condescension.\n\n“Well, Spunkie, come here,” commanded Billy, snapping her fingers at\nthe slow-moving creature on the hearthrug. “Spunkie, when I am your\nmistress, you'll have to change either your name or your nature. As if\nI were going to have such a bunch of independent moderation as you\nmasquerading as an understudy to my frisky little Spunk!”\n\nEverybody laughed. William regarded his namesake with fond eyes as he\nsaid:\n\n“Spunkie doesn't seem to be worrying.” The cat had jumped into Billy's\nlap with a matter-of-course air that was unmistakable--and to Bertram,\nadorable. Bertram's eyes, as they rested on Billy, were even fonder than\nwere his brother's.\n\n“I don't think any one is--_worrying_,” he said with quiet emphasis.\n\nBilly smiled.\n\n“I should think they might be,” she answered. “Only think how dreadfully\nupsetting I was in the first place!”\n\nWilliam's beaming face grew a little stern.\n\n“Nobody knew it but Kate--and she didn't _know_ it; she only imagined\nit,” he said tersely.\n\nBilly shook her head.\n\n“I'm not so sure,” she demurred. “As I look back at it now, I think I\ncan discern a few evidences myself--that I was upsetting. I was a bother\nto Bertram in his painting, I am sure.”\n\n“You were an inspiration,” corrected Bertram. “Think of the posing you\ndid for me.”\n\nA swift something like a shadow crossed Billy's face; but before her\nlover could question its meaning, it was gone.\n\n“And I know I was a torment to Cyril.” Billy had turned to the musician\nnow.\n\n“Well, I admit you were a little--upsetting, at times,” retorted that\nindividual, with something of his old imperturbable rudeness.\n\n“Nonsense!” cut in William, sharply. “You were never anything but a\ncomfort in the house, Billy, my dear--and you never will be.”\n\n“Thank you,” murmured Billy, demurely. “I'll remember that--when Pete\nand I disagree about the table decorations, and Dong Ling doesn't like\nthe way I want my soup seasoned.”\n\nAn anxious frown showed on Bertram's face.\n\n“Billy,” he said in a low voice, as the others laughed at her sally,\n“you needn't have Pete nor Dong Ling here if you don't want them.”\n\n“Don't want them!” echoed Billy, indignantly. “Of course I want them!”\n\n“But--Pete _is_ old, and--”\n\n“Yes; and where's he grown old? For whom has he worked the last fifty\nyears, while he's been growing old? I wonder if you think I'd let Pete\nleave this house as long as he _wants_ to stay! As for Dong Ling--”\n\nA sudden movement of Bertram's hand arrested her words. She looked up to\nfind Pete in the doorway.\n\n“Dinner is served, sir,” announced the old butler, his eyes on his\nmaster's face.\n\nWilliam rose with alacrity, and gave his arm to Aunt Hannah.\n\n“Well, I'm sure we're ready for dinner,” he declared.\n\nIt was a good dinner, and it was well served. It could scarcely have\nbeen otherwise with Dong Ling in the kitchen and Pete in the dining-room\ndoing their utmost to please. But even had the turkey been tough instead\nof tender, and even had the pies been filled with sawdust instead of\nwith delicious mincemeat, it is doubtful if four at the table would have\nknown the difference: Cyril and Marie at one end were discussing where\nto put their new sideboard in their dining-room, and Bertram and Billy\nat the other were talking of the next Thanksgiving, when, according to\nBertram, the Strata would have the “dearest little mistress that ever\nwas born.” As if, under these circumstances, the tenderness of the\nturkey or the toothsomeness of the mince pie mattered! To Aunt Hannah\nand William, in the centre of the table, however, it did matter; so it\nwas well, of course, that the dinner was a good one.\n\n“And now,” said Cyril, when dinner was over, “suppose you come up and\nsee the rug.”\n\nIn compliance with this suggestion, the six trailed up the long flights\nof stairs then, Billy carrying an extra shawl for Aunt Hannah--Cyril's\nrooms were always cool.\n\n“Oh, yes, I knew we should need it,” she nodded to Bertram, as she\npicked up the shawl from the hall stand where she had left it when she\ncame in. “That's why I brought it.”\n\n“Oh, my grief and conscience, Cyril, how _can_ you stand it?--to climb\nstairs like this,” panted Aunt Hannah, as she reached the top of the\nlast flight and dropped breathlessly into the nearest chair--from which\nMarie had rescued a curtain just in time.\n\n“Well, I'm not sure I could--if I were always to eat a Thanksgiving\ndinner just before,” laughed Cyril. “Maybe I ought to have waited and\nlet you rest an hour or two.”\n\n“But 'twould have been too dark, then, to see the rug,” objected Marie.\n“It's a genuine Persian--a Kirman, you know; and I'm so proud of it,”\n she added, turning to the others. “I wanted you to see the colors by\ndaylight. Cyril likes it better, anyhow, in the daytime.”\n\n“Fancy Cyril _liking_ any sort of a rug at any time,” chuckled Bertram,\nhis eyes on the rich, softly blended colors of the rug before him.\n“Honestly, Miss Marie,” he added, turning to the little bride elect,\n“how did you ever manage to get him to buy _any_ rug? He won't have so\nmuch as a ravelling on the floor up here to walk on.”\n\nA startled dismay came into Marie's blue eyes.\n\n“Why, I thought he wanted rugs,” she faltered. “I'm sure he said--”\n\n“Of course I want rugs,” interrupted Cyril, irritably. “I want them\neverywhere except in my own especial den. You don't suppose I want to\nhear other people clattering over bare floors all day, do you?”\n\n“Of course not!” Bertram's face was preternaturally grave as he turned\nto the little music teacher. “I hope, Miss Marie, that you wear rubber\nheels on your shoes,” he observed solicitously.\n\nEven Cyril laughed at this, though all he said was:\n\n“Come, come, I got you up here to look at the rug.”\n\nBertram, however, was not to be silenced.\n\n“And another thing, Miss Marie,” he resumed, with the air of a true and\ntried adviser. “Just let me give you a pointer. I've lived with your\nfuture husband a good many years, and I know what I'm talking about.”\n\n“Bertram, be still,” growled Cyril.\n\nBertram refused to be still.\n\n“Whenever you want to know anything about Cyril, listen to his playing.\nFor instance: if, after dinner, you hear a dreamy waltz or a sleepy\nnocturne, you may know that all is well. But if on your ears there falls\nanything like a dirge, or the wail of a lost spirit gone mad, better\nlook to your soup and see if it hasn't been scorched, or taste of your\npudding and see if you didn't put in salt instead of sugar.”\n\n“Bertram, will you be still?” cut in Cyril, testily, again.\n\n“After all, judging from what Billy tells me,” resumed Bertram,\ncheerfully, “what I've said won't be so important to you, for you aren't\nthe kind that scorches soups or uses salt for sugar. So maybe I'd better\nput it to you this way: if you want a new sealskin coat or an extra\ndiamond tiara, tackle him when he plays like this!” And with a swift\nturn Bertram dropped himself to the piano stool and dashed into a\nrollicking melody that half the newsboys of Boston were whistling.\n\nWhat happened next was a surprise to every one. Bertram, very much as\nif he were a naughty little boy, was jerked by a wrathful brother's hand\noff the piano stool. The next moment the wrathful brother himself sat at\nthe piano, and there burst on five pairs of astonished ears a crashing\ndissonance which was but the prelude to music such as few of the party\noften heard.\n\nSpellbound they listened while rippling runs and sonorous harmonies\nfilled the room to overflowing, as if under the fingers of the player\nthere were--not the keyboard of a piano--but the violins, flutes,\ncornets, trombones, bass viols and kettledrums of a full orchestra.\n\nBilly, perhaps, of them all, best understood. She knew that in those\ntripping melodies and crashing chords were Cyril's joy at the presence\nof Marie, his wrath at the flippancy of Bertram, his ecstasy at that for\nwhich the rug and curtains stood--the little woman sewing in the radiant\ncircle of a shaded lamp. Billy knew that all this and more were finding\nvoice at Cyril's finger tips. The others, too, understood in a way; but\nthey, unlike Billy, were not in the habit of finding on a few score bits\nof wood and ivory a vent for their moods and fancies.\n\nThe music was softer now. The resounding chords and purling runs had\nbecome a bell-like melody that wound itself in and out of a maze of\nexquisite harmonies, now hiding, now coming out clear and unafraid, like\na mountain stream emerging into a sunlit meadow from the leafy shadows\nof its forest home.\n\nIn a breathless hush the melody quivered into silence. It was Bertram\nwho broke the pause with a long-drawn:\n\n“By George!” Then, a little unsteadily: “If it's I that set you going\nlike that, old chap, I'll come up and play ragtime every day!”\n\nCyril shrugged his shoulders and got to his feet.\n\n“If you've seen all you want of the rug we'll go down-stairs,” he said\nnonchalantly.\n\n“But we haven't!” chorussed several indignant voices. And for the next\nfew minutes not even the owner of the beautiful Kirman could find any\nfault with the quantity or the quality of the attention bestowed on\nhis new possession. But Billy, under cover of the chatter, said\nreproachfully in his ear:\n\n“Oh, Cyril, to think you can play like that--and won't--on demand!”\n\n“I can't--on demand,” shrugged Cyril again.\n\nOn the way down-stairs they stopped at William's rooms.\n\n“I want you to see a couple of Batterseas I got last week,” cried\nthe collector eagerly, as he led the way to the black velvet square.\n“They're fine--and I think she looks like you,” he finished, turning\nto Billy, and holding out one of the knobs, on which was a beautifully\nexecuted miniature of a young girl with dark, dreamy eyes.\n\n“Oh, how pretty!” exclaimed Marie, over Billy's shoulder. “But what are\nthey?”\n\nThe collector turned, his face alight.\n\n“Mirror knobs. I've got lots of them. Would you like to see\nthem--really? They're right here.”\n\nThe next minute Marie found herself looking into a cabinet where lay a\nscore or more of round and oval discs of glass, porcelain, and metal,\nframed in silver, gilt, and brass, and mounted on long spikes.\n\n“Oh, how pretty,” cried Marie again; “but how--how queer! Tell me about\nthem, please.”\n\nWilliam drew a long breath. His eyes glistened. William loved to\ntalk--when he had a curio and a listener.\n\n“I will. Our great-grandmothers used them, you know, to support their\nmirrors, or to fasten back their curtains,” he explained ardently.\n“Now here's another Battersea enamel, but it isn't so good as my new\nones--that face is almost a caricature.”\n\n“But what a beautiful ship--on that round one!” exclaimed Marie. “And\nwhat's this one?--glass?”\n\n“Yes; but that's not so rare as the others. Still, it's pretty enough.\nDid you notice this one, with the bright red and blue and green on the\nwhite background?--regular Chinese mode of decoration, that is.”\n\n“Er--any time, William,” began Bertram, mischievously; but William did\nnot seem to hear.\n\n“Now in this corner,” he went on, warming to his subject, “are\nthe enamelled porcelains. They were probably made at the Worcester\nworks--England, you know; and I think many of them are quite as pretty\nas the Batterseas. You see it was at Worcester that they invented\nthat variation of the transfer printing process that they called bat\nprinting, where they used oil instead of ink, and gelatine instead of\npaper. Now engravings for that kind of printing were usually in stipple\nwork--dots, you know--so the prints on these knobs can easily be\ndistinguished from those of the transfer printing. See? Now, this one\nis--”\n\n“Er, of course, William, any time--” interposed Bertram again, his eyes\ntwinkling.\n\nWilliam stopped with a laugh.\n\n“Yes, I know. 'Tis time I talked of something else, Bertram,” he\nconceded.\n\n“But 'twas lovely, and I _was_ interested, really,” claimed Marie.\n“Besides, there are such a lot of things here that I'd like to see,” she\nfinished, turning slowly about.\n\n“These are what he was collecting last year,” murmured Billy, hovering\nover a small cabinet where were some beautiful specimens of antique\njewelry brooches, necklaces, armlets, Rajah rings, and anklets, gorgeous\nin color and exquisite in workmanship.\n\n“Well, here is something you _will_ enjoy,” declared Bertram, with an\nairy flourish. “Do you see those teapots? Well, we can have tea every\nday in the year, and not use one of them but five times. I've counted.\nThere are exactly seventy-three,” he concluded, as he laughingly led the\nway from the room.\n\n“How about leap year?” quizzed Billy.\n\n“Ho! Trust Will to find another 'Old Blue' or a 'perfect treasure of a\nblack basalt' by that time,” shrugged Bertram.\n\nBelow William's rooms was the floor once Bertram's, but afterwards given\nover to the use of Billy and Aunt Hannah. The rooms were open to-day,\nand were bright with sunshine and roses; but they were very plainly\nunoccupied.\n\n“And you don't use them yet?” remonstrated Billy, as she paused at an\nopen door.\n\n“No. These are Mrs. Bertram Henshaw's rooms,” said the youngest Henshaw\nbrother in a voice that made Billy hurry away with a dimpling blush.\n\n“They were Billy's--and they can never seem any one's but Billy's, now,”\n declared William to Marie, as they went down the stairs.\n\n“And now for the den and some good stories before the fire,” proposed\nBertram, as the six reached the first floor again.\n\n“But we haven't seen your pictures, yet,” objected Billy.\n\nBertram made a deprecatory gesture.\n\n“There's nothing much--” he began; but he stopped at once, with an odd\nlaugh. “Well, I sha'n't say _that_,” he finished, flinging open the door\nof his studio, and pressing a button that flooded the room with light.\nThe next moment, as they stood before those plaques and panels and\ncanvases--on each of which was a pictured “Billy”--they understood the\nchange in his sentence, and they laughed appreciatively.\n\n“'Much,' indeed!” exclaimed William.\n\n“Oh, how lovely!” breathed Marie.\n\n“My grief and conscience, Bertram! All these--and of Billy? I knew you\nhad a good many, but--” Aunt Hannah paused impotently, her eyes going\nfrom Bertram's face to the pictures again.\n\n“But how--when did you do them?” queried Marie.\n\n“Some of them from memory. More of them from life. A lot of them were\njust sketches that I did when she was here in the house four or five\nyears ago,” answered Bertram; “like this, for instance.” And he pulled\ninto a better light a picture of a laughing, dark-eyed girl holding\nagainst her cheek a small gray kitten, with alert, bright eyes. “The\noriginal and only Spunk,” he announced.\n\n“What a dear little cat!” cried Marie.\n\n“You should have seen it--in the flesh,” remarked Cyril, dryly. “No\npaint nor painter could imprison that untamed bit of Satanic mischief on\nany canvas that ever grew!”\n\nEverybody laughed--everybody but Billy. Billy, indeed, of them all, had\nbeen strangely silent ever since they entered the studio. She stood now\na little apart. Her eyes were wide, and a bit frightened. Her fingers\nwere twisting the corners of her handkerchief nervously. She was looking\nto the right and to the left, and everywhere she saw--herself.\n\nSometimes it was her full face, sometimes her profile; sometimes there\nwere only her eyes peeping from above a fan, or peering from out brown\nshadows of nothingness. Once it was merely the back of her head showing\nthe mass of waving hair with its high lights of burnished bronze. Again\nit was still the back of her head with below it the bare, slender\nneck and the scarf-draped shoulders. In this picture the curve of a\nhalf-turned cheek showed plainly, and in the background was visible\na hand holding four playing cards, at which the pictured girl was\nevidently looking. Sometimes it was a merry Billy with dancing eyes;\nsometimes a demure Billy with long lashes caressing a flushed cheek.\nSometimes it was a wistful Billy with eyes that looked straight into\nyours with peculiar appeal. But always it was--Billy.\n\n“There, I think the tilt of this chin is perfect.” It was Bertram\nspeaking.\n\nBilly gave a sudden cry. Her face whitened. She stumbled forward.\n\n“No, no, Bertram, you--you didn't mean the--the tilt of the chin,” she\nfaltered wildly.\n\nThe man turned in amazement.\n\n“Why--Billy!” he stammered. “Billy, what is it?”\n\nThe girl fell back at once. She tried to laugh lightly. She had seen the\ndismayed questioning in her lover's eyes, and in the eyes of William and\nthe others.\n\n“N-nothing,” she gesticulated hurriedly. “It was nothing at all, truly.”\n\n“But, Billy, it _was_ something.” Bertram's eyes were still troubled.\n“Was it the picture? I thought you liked this picture.”\n\nBilly laughed again--this time more naturally.\n\n“Bertram, I'm ashamed of you--expecting me to say I 'like' any of this,”\n she scolded, with a wave of her hands toward the omnipresent Billy.\n“Why, I feel as if I were in a room with a thousand mirrors, and that\nI'd been discovered putting rouge on my cheeks and lampblack on my\neyebrows!”\n\nWilliam laughed fondly. Aunt Hannah and Marie gave an indulgent smile.\nCyril actually chuckled. Bertram only still wore a puzzled expression as\nhe laid aside the canvas in his hands.\n\nBilly examined intently a sketch she had found with its back to the\nwall. It was not a pretty sketch; it was not even a finished one,\nand Billy did not in the least care what it was. But her lips cried\ninterestedly:\n\n“Oh, Bertram, what is this?”\n\nThere was no answer. Bertram was still engaged, apparently, in putting\naway some sketches. Over by the doorway leading to the den Marie and\nAunt Hannah, followed by William and Cyril, were just disappearing\nbehind a huge easel. In another minute the merry chatter of their voices\ncame from the room beyond. Bertram hurried then straight across the\nstudio to the girl still bending over the sketch in the corner.\n\n“Bertram!” gasped Billy, as a kiss brushed her cheek.\n\n“Pooh! They're gone. Besides, what if they did see? Billy, what was the\nmatter with the tilt of that chin?”\n\nBilly gave an hysterical little laugh--at least, Bertram tried to assure\nhimself that it was a laugh, though it had sounded almost like a sob.\n\n“Bertram, if you say another word about--about the tilt of that chin, I\nshall _scream!_” she panted.\n\n“Why, Billy!”\n\nWith a nervous little movement Billy turned and began to reverse the\ncanvases nearest her.\n\n“Come, sir,” she commanded gayly. “Billy has been on exhibition\nquite long enough. It is high time she was turned face to the wall to\nmeditate, and grow more modest.”\n\nBertram did not answer. Neither did he make a move to assist her. His\nardent gray eyes were following her slim, graceful figure admiringly.\n\n“Billy, it doesn't seem true, yet, that you're really mine,” he said at\nlast, in a low voice shaken with emotion.\n\nBilly turned abruptly. A peculiar radiance shone in her eyes and\nglorified her face. As she stood, she was close to a picture on an easel\nand full in the soft glow of the shaded lights above it.\n\n“Then you _do_ want me,” she began, “--just _me!_--not to--” she stopped\nshort. The man opposite had taken an eager step toward her. On his\nface was the look she knew so well, the look she had come almost to\ndread--the “painting look.”\n\n“Billy, stand just as you are,” he was saying. “Don't move. Jove! But\nthat effect is perfect with those dark shadows beyond, and just your\nhair and face and throat showing. I declare, I've half a mind to\nsketch--” But Billy, with a little cry, was gone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nA JOB FOR PETE--AND FOR BERTRAM\n\n\nThe early days in December were busy ones, certainly, in the little\nhouse on Corey Hill. Marie was to be married the twelfth. It was to be\na home wedding, and a very simple one--according to Billy, and according\nto what Marie had said it was to be. Billy still serenely spoke of it\nas a “simple affair,” but Marie was beginning to be fearful. As the\ndays passed, bringing with them more and more frequent evidences either\ntangible or intangible of orders to stationers, caterers, and florists,\nher fears found voice in a protest.\n\n“But Billy, it was to be a _simple_ wedding,” she cried.\n\n“And so it is.”\n\n“But what is this I hear about a breakfast?”\n\nBilly's chin assumed its most stubborn squareness.\n\n“I don't know, I'm sure, what you did hear,” she retorted calmly.\n\n“Billy!”\n\nBilly laughed. The chin was just as stubborn, but the smiling lips above\nit graced it with an air of charming concession.\n\n“There, there, dear,” coaxed the mistress of Hillside, “don't fret.\nBesides, I'm sure I should think you, of all people, would want your\nguests _fed!_”\n\n“But this is so elaborate, from what I hear.”\n\n“Nonsense! Not a bit of it.”\n\n“Rosa says there'll be salads and cakes and ices--and I don't know what\nall.”\n\nBilly looked concerned.\n\n“Well, of course, Marie, if you'd _rather_ have oatmeal and doughnuts,”\n she began with kind solicitude; but she got no farther.\n\n“Billy!” besought the bride elect. “Won't you be serious? And there's\nthe cake in wedding boxes, too.”\n\n“I know, but boxes are so much easier and cleaner than--just fingers,”\n apologized an anxiously serious voice.\n\nMarie answered with an indignant, grieved glance and hurried on.\n\n“And the flowers--roses, dozens of them, in December! Billy, I can't let\nyou do all this for me.”\n\n“Nonsense, dear!” laughed Billy. “Why, I love to do it. Besides, when\nyou're gone, just think how lonesome I'll be! I shall have to adopt\nsomebody else then--now that Mary Jane has proved to be nothing but a\ndisappointing man instead of a nice little girl like you,” she finished\nwhimsically.\n\nMarie did not smile. The frown still lay between her delicate brows.\n\n“And for my trousseau--there were so many things that you simply would\nbuy!”\n\n“I didn't get one of the egg-beaters,” Billy reminded her anxiously.\n\nMarie smiled now, but she shook her head, too.\n\n“Billy, I cannot have you do all this for me.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\nAt the unexpectedly direct question, Marie fell back a little.\n\n“Why, because I--I can't,” she stammered. “I can't get them for myself,\nand--and--”\n\n“Don't you love me?”\n\nA pink flush stole to Marie's face.\n\n“Indeed I do, dearly.”\n\n“Don't I love you?”\n\nThe flush deepened.\n\n“I--I hope so.”\n\n“Then why won't you let me do what I want to, and be happy in it? Money,\njust money, isn't any good unless you can exchange it for something you\nwant. And just now I want pink roses and ice cream and lace flounces\nfor you. Marie,”--Billy's voice trembled a little--“I never had a sister\ntill I had you, and I have had such a good time buying things that I\nthought you wanted! But, of course, if you don't want them--” The words\nended in a choking sob, and down went Billy's head into her folded arms\non the desk before her.\n\nMarie sprang to her feet and cuddled the bowed head in a loving embrace.\n\n“But I do want them, dear; I want them all--every single one,” she\nurged. “Now promise me--promise me that you'll do them all, just as\nyou'd planned! You will, won't you?”\n\nThere was the briefest of hesitations, then came the muffled reply:\n\n“Yes--if you really want them.”\n\n“I do, dear--indeed I do. I love pretty weddings, and I--I always hoped\nthat I could have one--if I ever married. So you must know, dear, how I\nreally do want all those things,” declared Marie, fervently. “And now I\nmust go. I promised to meet Cyril at Park Street at three o'clock.”\n And she hurried from the room--and not until she was half-way to her\ndestination did it suddenly occur to her that she had been urging,\nactually urging Miss Billy Neilson to buy for her pink roses, ice cream,\nand lace flounces.\n\nHer cheeks burned with shame then. But almost at once she smiled.\n\n“Now wasn't that just like Billy?” she was saying to herself, with a\ntender glow in her eyes.\n\n\nIt was early in December that Pete came one day with a package for Marie\nfrom Cyril. Marie was not at home, and Billy herself went downstairs to\ntake the package from the old man's hands.\n\n“Mr. Cyril said to give it to Miss Hawthorn,” stammered the old servant,\nhis face lighting up as Billy entered the room; “but I'm sure he\nwouldn't mind _your_ taking it.”\n\n“I'm afraid I'll have to take it, Pete, unless you want to carry it\nback with you,” she smiled. “I'll see that Miss Hawthorn has it the very\nfirst moment she comes in.”\n\n“Thank you, Miss. It does my old eyes good to see your bright face.” He\nhesitated, then turned slowly. “Good day, Miss Billy.”\n\nBilly laid the package on the table. Her eyes were thoughtful as she\nlooked after the old man, who was now almost to the door. Something in\nhis bowed form appealed to her strangely. She took a quick step toward\nhim.\n\n“You'll miss Mr. Cyril, Pete,” she said pleasantly.\n\nThe old man stopped at once and turned. He lifted his head a little\nproudly.\n\n“Yes, Miss. I--I was there when he was born. Mr. Cyril's a fine man.”\n\n“Indeed he is. Perhaps it's your good care that's helped, some--to make\nhim so,” smiled the girl, vaguely wishing that she could say something\nthat would drive the wistful look from the dim old eyes before her.\n\nFor a moment Billy thought she had succeeded. The old servant drew\nhimself stiffly erect. In his eyes shone the loyal pride of more than\nfifty years' honest service. Almost at once, however, the pride died\naway, and the wistfulness returned.\n\n“Thank ye, Miss; but I don't lay no claim to that, of course,” he said.\n“Mr. Cyril's a fine man, and we shall miss him; but--I cal'late changes\nmust come--to all of us.”\n\nBilly's brown eyes grew a little misty.\n\n“I suppose they must,” she admitted.\n\nThe old man hesitated; then, as if impelled by some hidden force, he\nplunged on:\n\n“Yes; and they'll be comin' to you one of these days, Miss, and that's\nwhat I was wantin' to speak to ye about. I understand, of course, that\nwhen you get there you'll be wantin' younger blood to serve ye. My feet\nain't so spry as they once was, and my old hands blunder sometimes,\nin spite of what my head bids 'em do. So I wanted to tell ye--that of\ncourse I shouldn't expect to stay. I'd go.”\n\nAs he said the words, Pete stood with head and shoulders erect, his eyes\nlooking straight forward but not at Billy.\n\n“Don't you _want_ to stay?” The girlish voice was a little reproachful.\n\nPete's head drooped.\n\n“Not if--I'm not wanted,” came the husky reply.\n\nWith an impulsive movement Billy came straight to the old man's side and\nheld out her hand.\n\n“Pete!”\n\nAmazement, incredulity, and a look that was almost terror crossed the\nold man's face; then a flood of dull red blotted them all out and left\nonly worshipful rapture. With a choking cry he took the slim little hand\nin both his rough and twisted ones much as if he were possessing himself\nof a treasured bit of eggshell china.\n\n“Miss Billy!”\n\n“Pete, there aren't a pair of feet in Boston, nor a pair of hands,\neither, that I'd rather have serve me than yours, no matter if they\nstumble and blunder all day! I shall love stumbles and blunders--if you\nmake them. Now run home, and don't ever let me hear another syllable\nabout your leaving!”\n\nThey were not the words Billy had intended to say. She had meant to\nspeak of his long, faithful service, and of how much they appreciated\nit; but, to her surprise, Billy found her own eyes wet and her own voice\ntrembling, and the words that she would have said she found fast shut\nin her throat. So there was nothing to do but to stammer out\nsomething--anything, that would help to keep her from yielding to that\nabsurd and awful desire to fall on the old servant's neck and cry.\n\n“Not another syllable!” she repeated sternly.\n\n“Miss Billy!” choked Pete again. Then he turned and fled with anything\nbut his usual dignity.\n\nBertram called that evening. When Billy came to him in the living-room,\nher slender self was almost hidden behind the swirls of damask linen in\nher arms.\n\nBertram's eyes grew mutinous.\n\n“Do you expect me to hug all that?” he demanded.\n\nBilly flashed him a mischievous glance.\n\n“Of course not! You don't _have_ to hug anything, you know.”\n\nFor answer he impetuously swept the offending linen into the nearest\nchair and drew the girl into his arms.\n\n“Oh! And see how you've crushed poor Marie's table-cloth!” she cried,\nwith reproachful eyes.\n\nBertram sniffed imperturbably.\n\n“I'm not sure but I'd like to crush Marie,” he alleged.\n\n“Bertram!”\n\n“I can't help it. See here, Billy.” He loosened his clasp and held the\ngirl off at arm's length, regarding her with stormy eyes. “It's Marie,\nMarie, Marie--always. If I telephone in the morning, you've gone\nshopping with Marie. If I want you in the afternoon for something,\nyou're at the dressmaker's with Marie. If I call in the evening--”\n\n“I'm here,” interrupted Billy, with decision.\n\n“Oh, yes, you're here,” admitted Bertram, aggrievedly, “and so are\ndozens of napkins, miles of table-cloths, and yards upon yards of lace\nand flummydiddles you call 'doilies.' They all belong to Marie, and they\nfill your arms and your thoughts full, until there isn't an inch of room\nfor me. Billy, when is this thing going to end?”\n\nBilly laughed softly. Her eyes danced.\n\n“The twelfth;--that is, there'll be a--pause, then.”\n\n“Well, I'm thankful if--eh?” broke off the man, with a sudden change of\nmanner. “What do you mean by 'a pause'?”\n\nBilly cast down her eyes demurely.\n\n“Well, of course _this_ ends the twelfth with Marie's wedding; but\nI've sort of regarded it as an--understudy for one that's coming next\nOctober, you see.”\n\n“Billy, you darling!” breathed a supremely happy voice in a shell-like\near--Billy was not at arm's length now.\n\nBilly smiled, but she drew away with gentle firmness.\n\n“And now I must go back to my sewing,” she said.\n\nBertram's arms did not loosen. His eyes had grown mutinous again.\n\n“That is,” she amended, “I must be practising my part of--the\nunderstudy, you know.”\n\n“You darling!” breathed Bertram again; this time, however, he let her\ngo.\n\n“But, honestly, is it all necessary?” he sighed despairingly, as she\nseated herself and gathered the table-cloth into her lap. “Do you have\nto do so much of it all?”\n\n“I do,” smiled Billy, “unless you want your brother to run the risk of\nleading his bride to the altar and finding her robed in a kitchen apron\nwith an egg-beater in her hand for a bouquet.”\n\nBertram laughed.\n\n“Is it so bad as that?”\n\n“No, of course not--quite. But never have I seen a bride so utterly\noblivious to clothes as Marie was till one day in despair I told her\nthat Cyril never could bear a dowdy woman.”\n\n“As if Cyril, in the old days, ever could bear any sort of woman!”\n scoffed Bertram, merrily.\n\n“I know; but I didn't mention that part,” smiled Billy. “I just singled\nout the dowdy one.”\n\n“Did it work?”\n\nBilly made a gesture of despair.\n\n“Did it work! It worked too well. Marie gave me one horrified look,\nthen at once and immediately she became possessed with the idea that\nshe _was_ a dowdy woman. And from that day to this she has pursued every\nlurking wrinkle and every fold awry, until her dressmaker's life isn't\nworth the living; and I'm beginning to think mine isn't, either, for I\nhave to assure her at least four times every day now that she is _not_ a\ndowdy woman.”\n\n“You poor dear,” laughed Bertram. “No wonder you don't have time to give\nto me!”\n\nA peculiar expression crossed Billy's face.\n\n“Oh, but I'm not the _only_ one who, at times, is otherwise engaged,\nsir,” she reminded him.\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“There was yesterday, and last Monday, and last week Wednesday, and--”\n\n“Oh, but you _let_ me off, then,” argued Bertram, anxiously. “And you\nsaid--”\n\n“That I didn't wish to interfere with your work--which was quite true,”\n interrupted Billy in her turn, smoothly. “By the way,”--Billy was\nexamining her stitches very closely now--“how is Miss Winthrop's\nportrait coming on?”\n\n“Splendidly!--that is, it _was_, until she began to put off the sittings\nfor her pink teas and folderols. She's going to Washington next week,\ntoo, to be gone nearly a fortnight,” finished Bertram, gloomily.\n\n“Aren't you putting more work than usual into this one--and more\nsittings?”\n\n“Well, yes,” laughed Bertram, a little shortly. “You see, she's changed\nthe pose twice already.”\n\n“Changed it!”\n\n“Yes. Wasn't satisfied. Fancied she wanted it different.”\n\n“But can't you--don't you have something to say about it?”\n\n“Oh, yes, of course; and she claims she'll yield to my judgment, anyhow.\nBut what's the use? She's been a spoiled darling all her life, and in\nthe habit of having her own way about everything. Naturally, under those\ncircumstances, I can't expect to get a satisfactory portrait, if she's\nout of tune with the pose. Besides, I will own, so far her suggestions\nhave made for improvement--probably because she's been happy in making\nthem, so her expression has been good.”\n\nBilly wet her lips.\n\n“I saw her the other night,” she said lightly. (If the lightness was\na little artificial Bertram did not seem to notice it.) “She is\ncertainly--very beautiful.”\n\n“Yes.” Bertram got to his feet and began to walk up and down the little\nroom. His eyes were alight. On his face the “painting look” was king.\n“It's going to mean a lot to me--this picture, Billy. In the first place\nI'm just at the point in my career where a big success would mean a\nlot--and where a big failure would mean more. And this portrait is bound\nto be one or the other from the very nature of the thing.”\n\n“I-is it?” Billy's voice was a little faint.\n\n“Yes. First, because of who the sitter is, and secondly because of what\nshe is. She is, of course, the most famous subject I've had, and half\nthe artistic world knows by this time that Marguerite Winthrop is being\ndone by Henshaw. You can see what it'll be--if I fail.”\n\n“But you won't fail, Bertram!”\n\nThe artist lifted his chin and threw back his shoulders.\n\n“No, of course not; but--” He hesitated, frowned, and dropped himself\ninto a chair. His eyes studied the fire moodily. “You see,” he resumed,\nafter a moment, “there's a peculiar, elusive something about her\nexpression--” (Billy stirred restlessly and gave her thread so savage a\njerk that it broke)”--a something that isn't easily caught by the brush.\nAnderson and Fullam--big fellows, both of them--didn't catch it. At\nleast, I've understood that neither her family nor her friends are\nsatisfied with _their_ portraits. And to succeed where Anderson and\nFullam failed--Jove! Billy, a chance like that doesn't come to a fellow\ntwice in a lifetime!” Bertram was out of his chair, again, tramping up\nand down the little room.\n\nBilly tossed her work aside and sprang to her feet. Her eyes, too, were\nalight, now.\n\n“But you aren't going to fail, dear,” she cried, holding out both her\nhands. “You're going to succeed!”\n\nBertram caught the hands and kissed first one then the other of their\nsoft little palms.\n\n“Of course I am,” he agreed passionately, leading her to the sofa, and\nseating himself at her side.\n\n“Yes, but you must really _feel_ it,” she urged; “feel the '_sure_' in\nyourself. You have to!--to doing things. That's what I told Mary Jane\nyesterday, when he was running on about what _he_ wanted to do--in his\nsinging, you know.”\n\nBertram stiffened a little. A quick frown came to his face.\n\n“Mary Jane, indeed! Of all the absurd names to give a full-grown,\nsix-foot man! Billy, do, for pity's sake, call him by his name--if he's\ngot one.”\n\nBilly broke into a rippling laugh.\n\n“I wish I could, dear,” she sighed ingenuously.\n\n“Honestly, it bothers me because I _can't_ think of him as anything but\n'Mary Jane.' It seems so silly!”\n\n“It certainly does--when one remembers his beard.”\n\n“Oh, he's shaved that off now. He looks rather better, too.”\n\nBertram turned a little sharply.\n\n“Do you see the fellow--often?”\n\nBilly laughed merrily.\n\n“No. He's about as disgruntled as you are over the way the wedding\nmonopolizes everything. He's been up once or twice to see Aunt Hannah\nand to get acquainted, as he expresses it, and once he brought up some\nmusic and we sang; but he declares the wedding hasn't given him half a\nshow.”\n\n“Indeed! Well, that's a pity, I'm sure,” rejoined Bertram, icily.\n\nBilly turned in slight surprise.\n\n“Why, Bertram, don't you like Mary Jane?”\n\n“Billy, for heaven's sake! _Hasn't_ he got any name but that?”\n\nBilly clapped her hands together suddenly.\n\n“There, that makes me think. He told Aunt Hannah and me to guess what\nhis name was, and we never hit it once. What do you think it is? The\ninitials are M. J.”\n\n“I couldn't say, I'm sure. What is it?”\n\n“Oh, he didn't tell us. You see he left us to guess it.”\n\n“Did he?”\n\n“Yes,” mused Billy, abstractedly, her eyes on the dancing fire. The next\nminute she stirred and settled herself more comfortably in the curve\nof her lover's arm. “But there! who cares what his name is? I'm sure I\ndon't.”\n\n“Nor I,” echoed Bertram in a voice that he tried to make not too\nfervent. He had not forgotten Billy's surprised: “Why, Bertram, don't\nyou like Mary Jane?” and he did not like to call forth a repetition of\nit. Abruptly, therefore, he changed the subject. “By the way, what did\nyou do to Pete to-day?” he asked laughingly. “He came home in a seventh\nheaven of happiness babbling of what an angel straight from the sky Miss\nBilly was. Naturally I agreed with him on that point. But what did you\ndo to him?”\n\nBilly smiled.\n\n“Nothing--only engaged him for our butler--for life.”\n\n“Oh, I see. That was dear of you, Billy.”\n\n“As if I'd do anything else! And now for Dong Ling, I suppose, some\nday.”\n\nBertram chuckled.\n\n“Well, maybe I can help you there,” he hinted. “You see, his Celestial\nMajesty came to me himself the other day, and said, after sundry and\nvarious preliminaries, that he should be 'velly much glad' when the\n'Little Missee' came to live with me, for then he could go back to China\nwith a heart at rest, as he had money 'velly much plenty' and didn't\nwish to be 'Melican man' any longer.”\n\n“Dear me,” smiled Billy, “what a happy state of affairs--for him. But\nfor you--do you realize, young man, what that means for you? A new wife\nand a new cook all at once? And you know I'm not Marie!”\n\n“Ho! I'm not worrying,” retorted Bertram with a contented smile;\n“besides, as perhaps you noticed, it wasn't Marie that I asked--to marry\nme!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. A CLOCK AND AUNT HANNAH\n\n\nMrs. Kate Hartwell, the Henshaw brothers' sister from the West, was\nexpected on the tenth. Her husband could not come, she had written, but\nshe would bring with her, little Kate, the youngest child. The boys,\nPaul and Egbert, would stay with their father.\n\nBilly received the news of little Kate's coming with outspoken delight.\n\n“The very thing!” she cried. “We'll have her for a flower girl. She was\na dear little creature, as I remember her.”\n\nAunt Hannah gave a sudden low laugh.\n\n“Yes, I remember,” she observed. “Kate told me, after you spent the\nfirst day with her, that you graciously informed her that little\nKate was almost as nice as Spunk. Kate did not fully appreciate the\ncompliment, I fear.”\n\nBilly made a wry face.\n\n“Did I say that? Dear me! I _was_ a terror in those days, wasn't I?\nBut then,” and she laughed softly, “really, Aunt Hannah, that was the\nprettiest thing I knew how to say, for I considered Spunk the top-notch\nof desirability.”\n\n“I think I should have liked to know Spunk,” smiled Marie from the other\nside of the sewing table.\n\n“He was a dear,” declared Billy. “I had another 'most as good when I\nfirst came to Hillside, but he got lost. For a time it seemed as if I\nnever wanted another, but I've about come to the conclusion now that I\ndo, and I've told Bertram to find one for me if he can. You see I\nshall be lonesome after you're gone, Marie, and I'll have to have\n_something_,” she finished mischievously.\n\n“Oh, I don't mind the inference--as long as I know your admiration of\ncats,” laughed Marie.\n\n“Let me see; Kate writes she is coming the tenth,” murmured Aunt Hannah,\ngoing back to the letter in her hand.\n\n“Good!” nodded Billy. “That will give time to put little Kate through\nher paces as flower girl.”\n\n“Yes, and it will give Big Kate time to _try_ to make your breakfast a\nsupper, and your roses pinks--or sunflowers,” cut in a new voice, dryly.\n\n“Cyril!” chorussed the three ladies in horror, adoration, and\namusement--according to whether the voice belonged to Aunt Hannah,\nMarie, or Billy.\n\nCyril shrugged his shoulders and smiled.\n\n“I beg your pardon,” he apologized; “but Rosa said you were in here\nsewing, and I told her not to bother. I'd announce myself. Just as I\ngot to the door I chanced to hear Billy's speech, and I couldn't\nresist making the amendment. Maybe you've forgotten Kate's love of\nmanaging--but I haven't,” he finished, as he sauntered over to the chair\nnearest Marie.\n\n“No, I haven't--forgotten,” observed Billy, meaningly.\n\n“Nor I--nor anybody else,” declared a severe voice--both the words and\nthe severity being most extraordinary as coming from the usually gentle\nAunt Hannah.\n\n“Oh, well, never mind,” spoke up Billy, quickly. “Everything's all right\nnow, so let's forget it. She always meant it for kindness, I'm sure.”\n\n“Even when she told you in the first place what a--er--torment you were\nto us?” quizzed Cyril.\n\n“Yes,” flashed Billy. “She was being kind to _you_, then.”\n\n“Humph!” vouchsafed Cyril.\n\nFor a moment no one spoke. Cyril's eyes were on Marie, who was nervously\ntrying to smooth back a few fluffy wisps of hair that had escaped from\nrestraining combs and pins.\n\n“What's the matter with the hair, little girl?” asked Cyril in a\nvoice that was caressingly irritable. “You've been fussing with that\nlong-suffering curl for the last five minutes!”\n\nMarie's delicate face flushed painfully.\n\n“It's got loose--my hair,” she stammered, “and it looks so dowdy that\nway!”\n\nBilly dropped her thread suddenly. She sprang for it at once, before\nCyril could make a move to get it. She had to dive far under a chair\nto capture it--which may explain why her face was so very red when she\nfinally reached her seat again.\n\n\nOn the morning of the tenth, Billy, Marie, and Aunt Hannah were once\nmore sewing together, this time in the little sitting-room at the end of\nthe hall up-stairs.\n\nBilly's fingers, in particular, were flying very fast.\n\n“I told John to have Peggy at the door at eleven,” she said, after a\ntime; “but I think I can finish running in this ribbon before then. I\nhaven't much to do to get ready to go.”\n\n“I hope Kate's train won't be late,” worried Aunt Hannah.\n\n“I hope not,” replied Billy; “but I told Rosa to delay luncheon, anyway,\ntill we get here. I--” She stopped abruptly and turned a listening\near toward the door of Aunt Hannah's room, which was open. A clock was\nstriking. “Mercy! that can't be eleven now,” she cried. “But it must\nbe--it was ten before I came up-stairs.” She got to her feet hurriedly.\n\nAunt Hannah put out a restraining hand.\n\n“No, no, dear, that's half-past ten.”\n\n“But it struck eleven.”\n\n“Yes, I know. It does--at half-past ten.”\n\n“Why, the little wretch,” laughed Billy, dropping back into her chair\nand picking up her work again. “The idea of its telling fibs like that\nand frightening people half out of their lives! I'll have it fixed right\naway. Maybe John can do it--he's always so handy about such things.”\n\n“But I don't want it fixed,” demurred Aunt Hannah.\n\nBilly stared a little.\n\n“You don't want it fixed! Maybe you like to have it strike eleven when\nit's half-past ten!” Billy's voice was merrily sarcastic.\n\n“Y-yes, I do,” stammered the lady, apologetically. “You see, I--I worked\nvery hard to fix it so it would strike that way.”\n\n“_Aunt Hannah!_”\n\n“Well, I did,” retorted the lady, with unexpected spirit. “I wanted to\nknow what time it was in the night--I'm awake such a lot.”\n\n“But I don't see.” Billy's eyes were perplexed. “Why must you make it\ntell fibs in order to--to find out the truth?” she laughed.\n\nAunt Hannah elevated her chin a little.\n\n“Because that clock was always striking one.”\n\n“One!”\n\n“Yes--half-past, you know; and I never knew which half-past it was.”\n\n“But it must strike half-past now, just the same!”\n\n“It does.” There was the triumphant ring of the conqueror in Aunt\nHannah's voice. “But now it strikes half-past _on the hour_, and the\nclock in the hall tells me _then_ what time it is, so I don't care.”\n\nFor one more brief minute Billy stared, before a sudden light of\nunderstanding illumined her face. Then her laugh rang out gleefully.\n\n“Oh, Aunt Hannah, Aunt Hannah,” she gurgled. “If Bertram wouldn't\ncall you the limit--making a clock strike eleven so you'll know it's\nhalf-past ten!”\n\nAunt Hannah colored a little, but she stood her ground.\n\n“Well, there's only half an hour, anyway, now, that I don't know what\ntime it is,” she maintained, “for one or the other of those clocks\nstrikes the hour every thirty minutes. Even during those never-ending\nthree ones that strike one after the other in the middle of the night,\nI can tell now, for the hall clock has a different sound for the\nhalf-hours, you know, so I can tell whether it's one or a half-past.”\n\n“Of course,” chuckled Billy.\n\n“I'm sure I think it's a splendid idea,” chimed in Marie, valiantly;\n“and I'm going to write it to mother's Cousin Jane right away. She's an\ninvalid, and she's always lying awake nights wondering what time it is.\nThe doctor says actually he believes she'd get well if he could find\nsome way of letting her know the time at night, so she'd get some sleep;\nfor she simply can't go to sleep till she knows. She can't bear a light\nin the room, and it wakes her all up to turn an electric switch, or\nanything of that kind.”\n\n“Why doesn't she have one of those phosphorous things?” questioned\nBilly.\n\nMarie laughed quietly.\n\n“She did. I sent her one,--and she stood it just one night.”\n\n“Stood it!”\n\n“Yes. She declared it gave her the creeps, and that she wouldn't have\nthe spooky thing staring at her all night like that. So it's got to be\nsomething she can hear, and I'm going to tell her Mrs. Stetson's plan\nright away.”\n\n“Well, I'm sure I wish you would,” cried that lady, with prompt\ninterest; “and she'll like it, I'm sure. And tell her if she can hear\na _town_ clock strike, it's just the same, and even better; for there\naren't any half-hours at all to think of there.”\n\n“I will--and I think it's lovely,” declared Marie.\n\n“Of course it's lovely,” smiled Billy, rising; “but I fancy I'd better\ngo and get ready to meet Mrs. Hartwell, or the 'lovely' thing will be\ntelling me that it's half-past eleven!” And she tripped laughingly from\nthe room.\n\nPromptly at the appointed time John with Peggy drew up before the\ndoor, and Billy, muffled in furs, stepped into the car, which, with its\nprotecting top and sides and glass wind-shield, was in its winter dress.\n\n“Yes'm, 'tis a little chilly, Miss,” said John, in answer to her\ngreeting, as he tucked the heavy robes about her.\n\n“Oh, well, I shall be very comfortable, I'm sure,” smiled Billy. “Just\ndon't drive too rapidly, specially coming home. I shall have to get a\nlimousine, I think, when my ship comes in, John.”\n\nJohn's grizzled old face twitched. So evident were the words that were\nnot spoken that Billy asked laughingly:\n\n“Well, John, what is it?”\n\nJohn reddened furiously.\n\n“Nothing, Miss. I was only thinkin' that if you didn't 'tend ter haulin'\nin so many other folks's ships, yours might get in sooner.”\n\n“Why, John! Nonsense! I--I love to haul in other folks's ships,” laughed\nthe girl, embarrassedly.\n\n“Yes, Miss; I know you do,” grunted John.\n\nBilly colored.\n\n“No, no--that is, I mean--I don't do it--very much,” she stammered.\n\nJohn did not answer apparently; but Billy was sure she caught a\nlow-muttered, indignant “much!” as he snapped the door shut and took his\nplace at the wheel.\n\nTo herself she laughed softly. She thought she possessed the secret now\nof some of John's disapproving glances toward her humble guests of the\nsummer before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. SISTER KATE\n\n\nAt the station Mrs. Hartwell's train was found to be gratifyingly on\ntime; and in due course Billy was extending a cordial welcome to a tall,\nhandsome woman who carried herself with an unmistakable air of assured\ncompetence. Accompanying her was a little girl with big blue eyes and\nyellow curls.\n\n“I am very glad to see you both,” smiled Billy, holding out a friendly\nhand to Mrs. Hartwell, and stooping to kiss the round cheek of the\nlittle girl.\n\n“Thank you, you are very kind,” murmured the lady; “but--are you alone,\nBilly? Where are the boys?”\n\n“Uncle William is out of town, and Cyril is rushed to death and sent his\nexcuses. Bertram did mean to come, but he telephoned this morning that\nhe couldn't, after all. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you'll have to make\nthe best of just me,” condoled Billy. “They'll be out to the house\nthis evening, of course--all but Uncle William. He doesn't return until\nto-morrow.”\n\n“Oh, doesn't he?” murmured the lady, reaching for her daughter's hand.\n\nBilly looked down with a smile.\n\n“And this is little Kate, I suppose,” she said, “whom I haven't seen for\nsuch a long, long time. Let me see, you are how old now?”\n\n“I'm eight. I've been eight six weeks.”\n\nBilly's eyes twinkled.\n\n“And you don't remember me, I suppose.”\n\nThe little girl shook her head.\n\n“No; but I know who you are,” she added, with shy eagerness. “You're\ngoing to be my Aunt Billy, and you're going to marry my Uncle William--I\nmean, my Uncle Bertram.”\n\nBilly's face changed color. Mrs. Hartwell gave a despairing gesture.\n\n“Kate, my dear, I told you to be sure and remember that it was your\nUncle Bertram now. You see,” she added in a discouraged aside to Billy,\n“she can't seem to forget the first one. But then, what can you expect?”\n laughed Mrs. Hartwell, a little disagreeably. “Such abrupt changes from\none brother to another are somewhat disconcerting, you know.”\n\nBilly bit her lip. For a moment she said nothing, then, a little\nconstrainedly, she rejoined:\n\n“Perhaps. Still--let us hope we have the right one, now.”\n\nMrs. Hartwell raised her eyebrows.\n\n“Well, my dear, I'm not so confident of that. _My_ choice has been and\nalways will be--William.”\n\nBilly bit her lip again. This time her brown eyes flashed a little.\n\n“Is that so? But you see, after all, _you_ aren't making the--the\nchoice.” Billy spoke lightly, gayly; and she ended with a bright little\nlaugh, as if to hide any intended impertinence.\n\nIt was Mrs. Hartwell's turn to bite her lip--and she did it.\n\n“So it seems,” she rejoined frigidly, after the briefest of pauses.\n\nIt was not until they were on their way to Corey Hill some time later\nthat Mrs. Hartwell turned with the question:\n\n“Cyril is to be married in church, I suppose?”\n\n“No. They both preferred a home wedding.”\n\n“Oh, what a pity! Church weddings are so attractive!”\n\n“To those who like them,” amended Billy in spite of herself.\n\n“To every one, I think,” corrected Mrs. Hartwell, positively.\n\nBilly laughed. She was beginning to discern that it did not do much\nharm--nor much good--to disagree with her guest.\n\n“It's in the evening, then, of course?” pursued Mrs. Hartwell.\n\n“No; at noon.”\n\n“Oh, how could you let them?”\n\n“But they preferred it, Mrs. Hartwell.”\n\n“What if they did?” retorted the lady, sharply. “Can't you do as you\nplease in your own home? Evening weddings are so much prettier! We can't\nchange now, of course, with the guests all invited. That is, I suppose\nyou do have guests!”\n\nMrs. Hartwell's voice was aggrievedly despairing.\n\n“Oh, yes,” smiled Billy, demurely. “We have guests invited--and I'm\nafraid we can't change the time.”\n\n“No, of course not; but it's too bad. I conclude there are announcements\nonly, as I got no cards.\n\n“Announcements only,” bowed Billy.\n\n“I wish Cyril had consulted _me_, a little, about this affair.”\n\nBilly did not answer. She could not trust herself to speak just then.\nCyril's words of two days before were in her ears: “Yes, and it will\ngive Big Kate time to try to make your breakfast supper, and your roses\npinks--or sunflowers.”\n\nIn a moment Mrs. Hartwell spoke again.\n\n“Of course a noon wedding is quite pretty if you darken the rooms and\nhave lights--you're going to do that, I suppose?”\n\nBilly shook her head slowly.\n\n“I'm afraid not, Mrs. Hartwell. That isn't the plan, now.”\n\n“Not darken the rooms!” exclaimed Mrs. Hartwell. “Why, it won't--”\n She stopped suddenly, and fell back in her seat. The look of annoyed\ndisappointment gave way to one of confident relief. “But then, _that\ncan_ be changed,” she finished serenely.\n\nBilly opened her lips, but she shut them without speaking. After a\nminute she opened them again.\n\n“You might consult--Cyril--about that,” she said in a quiet voice.\n\n“Yes, I will,” nodded Mrs. Hartwell, brightly. She was looking pleased\nand happy again. “I love weddings. Don't you? You can _do_ so much with\nthem!”\n\n“Can you?” laughed Billy, irrepressibly.\n\n“Yes. Cyril is happy, of course. Still, I can't imagine _him_ in love\nwith any woman.”\n\n“I think Marie can.”\n\n“I suppose so. I don't seem to remember her much; still, I think I saw\nher once or twice when I was on last June. Music teacher, wasn't she?”\n\n“Yes. She is a very sweet girl.”\n\n“Hm-m; I suppose so. Still, I think 'twould have been better if Cyril\ncould have selected some one that _wasn't_ musical--say a more domestic\nwife. He's so terribly unpractical himself about household matters.”\n\nBilly gave a ringing laugh and stood up. The car had come to a stop\nbefore her own door.\n\n“Do you? Just you wait till you see Marie's trousseau of--egg-beaters\nand cake tins,” she chuckled.\n\nMrs. Hartwell looked blank.\n\n“Whatever in the world do you mean, Billy?” she demanded fretfully, as\nshe followed her hostess from the car. “I declare! aren't you ever going\nto grow beyond making those absurd remarks of yours?”\n\n“Maybe--sometime,” laughed Billy, as she took little Kate's hand and led\nthe way up the steps.\n\nLuncheon in the cozy dining-room at Hillside that day was not entirely\na success. At least there were not present exactly the harmony and\ntranquillity that are conceded to be the best sauce for one's food. The\nwedding, of course, was the all-absorbing topic of conversation; and\nBilly, between Aunt Hannah's attempts to be polite, Marie's to be\nsweet-tempered, Mrs. Hartwell's to be dictatorial, and her own to be\npacifying as well as firm, had a hard time of it. If it had not been\nfor two or three diversions created by little Kate, the meal would have\nbeen, indeed, a dismal failure.\n\nBut little Kate--most of the time the personification of proper\nlittle-girlhood--had a disconcerting faculty of occasionally dropping a\nword here, or a question there, with startling effect. As, for instance,\nwhen she asked Billy “Who's going to boss your wedding?” and again when\nshe calmly informed her mother that when _she_ was married she was not\ngoing to have any wedding at all to bother with, anyhow. She was going\nto elope, and she should choose somebody's chauffeur, because he'd know\nhow to go the farthest and fastest so her mother couldn't catch up with\nher and tell her how she ought to have done it.\n\nAfter luncheon Aunt Hannah went up-stairs for rest and recuperation.\nMarie took little Kate and went for a brisk walk--for the same purpose.\nThis left Billy alone with her guest.\n\n“Perhaps you would like a nap, too, Mrs. Hartwell,” suggested Billy,\nas they passed into the living-room. There was a curious note of almost\nhopefulness in her voice.\n\nMrs. Hartwell scorned naps, and she said so very emphatically. She said\nsomething else, too.\n\n“Billy, why do you always call me 'Mrs. Hartwell' in that stiff, formal\nfashion? You used to call me 'Aunt Kate.'”\n\n“But I was very young then.” Billy's voice was troubled. Billy had\nbeen trying so hard for the last two hours to be the graciously cordial\nhostess to this woman--Bertram's sister.\n\n“Very true. Then why not 'Kate' now?”\n\nBilly hesitated. She was wondering why it seemed so hard to call Mrs.\nHartwell “Kate.”\n\n“Of course,” resumed the lady, “when you're Bertram's wife and my\nsister--”\n\n“Why, of course,” cried Billy, in a sudden flood of understanding.\nCuriously enough, she had never before thought of Mrs. Hartwell as _her_\nsister. “I shall be glad to call you 'Kate'--if you like.”\n\n“Thank you. I shall like it very much, Billy,” nodded the other\ncordially. “Indeed, my dear, I'm very fond of you, and I was delighted\nto hear you were to be my sister. If only--it could have stayed William\ninstead of Bertram.”\n\n“But it couldn't,” smiled Billy. “It wasn't William--that I loved.”\n\n“But _Bertram!_--it's so absurd.”\n\n“Absurd!” The smile was gone now.\n\n“Yes. Forgive me, Billy, but I was about as much surprised to hear of\nBertram's engagement as I was of Cyril's.”\n\nBilly grew a little white.\n\n“But Bertram was never an avowed--woman-hater, like Cyril, was he?”\n\n“'Woman-hater'--dear me, no! He was a woman-lover, always. As if his\neternal 'Face of a Girl' didn't prove that! Bertram has always loved\nwomen--to paint. But as for his ever taking them seriously--why, Billy,\nwhat's the matter?”\n\nBilly had risen suddenly.\n\n“If you'll excuse me, please, just a few minutes,” Billy said very\nquietly. “I want to speak to Rosa in the kitchen. I'll be back--soon.”\n\nIn the kitchen Billy spoke to Rosa--she wondered afterwards what she\nsaid. Certainly she did not stay in the kitchen long enough to say much.\nIn her own room a minute later, with the door fast closed, she took\nfrom her table the photograph of Bertram and held it in her two hands,\ntalking to it softly, but a little wildly.\n\n“I didn't listen! I didn't stay! Do you hear? I came to you. She\nshall not say anything that will make trouble between you and me. I've\nsuffered enough through her already! And she doesn't _know_--she didn't\nknow before, and she doesn't now. She's only imagining. I will not\nnot--_not_ believe that you love me--just to paint. No matter what they\nsay--all of them! I _will not!_”\n\nBilly put the photograph back on the table then, and went down-stairs to\nher guest. She smiled brightly, though her face was a little pale.\n\n“I wondered if perhaps you wouldn't like some music,” she said\npleasantly, going straight to the piano.\n\n“Indeed I would!” agreed Mrs. Hartwell.\n\nBilly sat down then and played--played as Mrs. Hartwell had never heard\nher play before.\n\n“Why, Billy, you amaze me,” she cried, when the pianist stopped and\nwhirled about. “I had no idea you could play like that!”\n\nBilly smiled enigmatically. Billy was thinking that Mrs. Hartwell would,\nindeed, have been surprised if she had known that in that playing\nwere herself, the ride home, the luncheon, Bertram, and the girl--whom\nBertram _did not love only to paint!_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. CYRIL AND A WEDDING\n\n\nThe twelfth was a beautiful day. Clear, frosty air set the blood to\ntingling and the eyes to sparkling, even if it were not your wedding\nday; while if it were--\n\nIt _was_ Marie Hawthorn's wedding day, and certainly her eyes sparkled\nand her blood tingled as she threw open the window of her room and\nbreathed long and deep of the fresh morning air before going down to\nbreakfast.\n\n“They say 'Happy is the bride that the sun shines on,'” she whispered\nsoftly to an English sparrow that cocked his eye at her from a\nneighboring tree branch. “As if a bride wouldn't be happy, sun or no\nsun,” she scoffed tenderly, as she turned to go down-stairs.\n\nAs it happens, however, tingling blood and sparkling eyes are a matter\nof more than weather, or even weddings, as was proved a little later\nwhen the telephone bell rang.\n\nKate answered the ring.\n\n“Hullo, is that you, Kate?” called a despairing voice.\n\n“Yes. Good morning, Bertram. Isn't this a fine day for the wedding?”\n\n“Fine! Oh, yes, I suppose so, though I must confess I haven't noticed\nit--and you wouldn't, if you had a lunatic on your hands.”\n\n“A lunatic!”\n\n“Yes. Maybe you have, though. Is Marie rampaging around the house like a\nwild creature, and asking ten questions and making twenty threats to the\nminute?”\n\n“Certainly not! Don't be absurd, Bertram. What do you mean?”\n\n“See here, Kate, that show comes off at twelve sharp, doesn't it?”\n\n“Show, indeed!” retorted Kate, indignantly. “The _wedding_ is at noon\nsharp--as the best man should know very well.”\n\n“All right; then tell Billy, please, to see that it is sharp, or I won't\nanswer for the consequences.”\n\n“What do you mean? What is the matter?”\n\n“Cyril. He's broken loose at last. I've been expecting it all along.\nI've simply marvelled at the meekness with which he has submitted\nhimself to be tied up with white ribbons and topped with roses.”\n\n“Nonsense, Bertram!”\n\n“Well, it amounts to that. Anyhow, he thinks it does, and he's wild. I\nwish you could have heard the thunderous performance on his piano with\nwhich he woke me up this morning. Billy says he plays everything--his\npast, present, and future. All is, if he was playing his future this\nmorning, I pity the girl who's got to live it with him.”\n\n“Bertram!”\n\nBertram chuckled remorselessly.\n\n“Well, I do. But I'll warrant he wasn't playing his future this morning.\nHe was playing his present--the wedding. You see, he's just waked up to\nthe fact that it'll be a perfect orgy of women and other confusion,\nand he doesn't like it. All the samee,{sic} I've had to assure him just\nfourteen times this morning that the ring, the license, the carriage,\nthe minister's fee, and my sanity are all O. K. When he isn't asking\nquestions he's making threats to snake the parson up there an hour ahead\nof time and be off with Marie before a soul comes.”\n\n“What an absurd idea!”\n\n“Cyril doesn't think so. Indeed, Kate, I've had a hard struggle to\nconvince him that the guests wouldn't think it the most delightful\nexperience of their lives if they should come and find the ceremony over\nwith and the bride gone.”\n\n“Well, you remind Cyril, please, that there are other people besides\nhimself concerned in this wedding,” observed Kate, icily.\n\n“I have,” purred Bertram, “and he says all right, let them have it,\nthen. He's gone now to look up proxy marriages, I believe.”\n\n“Proxy marriages, indeed! Come, come, Bertram, I've got something to do\nthis morning besides to stand here listening to your nonsense. See\nthat you and Cyril get here on time--that's all!” And she hung up the\nreceiver with an impatient jerk.\n\nShe turned to confront the startled eyes of the bride elect.\n\n“What is it? Is anything wrong--with Cyril?” faltered Marie.\n\nKate laughed and raised her eyebrows slightly.\n\n“Nothing but a little stage fright, my dear.”\n\n“Stage fright!”\n\n“Yes. Bertram says he's trying to find some one to play his rôle, I\nbelieve, in the ceremony.”\n\n“_Mrs. Hartwell!_”\n\nAt the look of dismayed terror that came into Marie's face, Mrs.\nHartwell laughed reassuringly.\n\n“There, there, dear child, don't look so horror-stricken. There probably\nnever was a man yet who wouldn't have fled from the wedding part of his\nmarriage if he could; and you know how Cyril hates fuss and feathers.\nThe wonder to me is that he's stood it as long as he has. I thought I\nsaw it coming, last night at the rehearsal--and now I know I did.”\n\nMarie still looked distressed.\n\n“But he never said--I thought--” She stopped helplessly.\n\n“Of course he didn't, child. He never said anything but that he loved\nyou, and he never thought anything but that you were going to be his.\nMen never do--till the wedding day. Then they never think of anything\nbut a place to run,” she finished laughingly, as she began to arrange on\na stand the quantity of little white boxes waiting for her.\n\n“But if he'd told me--in time, I wouldn't have had a thing--but the\nminister,” faltered Marie.\n\n“And when you think so much of a pretty wedding, too? Nonsense! It isn't\ngood for a man, to give up to his whims like that!”\n\nMarie's cheeks grew a deeper pink. Her nostrils dilated a little.\n\n“It wouldn't be a 'whim,' Mrs. Hartwell, and I should be _glad_ to give\nup,” she said with decision.\n\nMrs. Hartwell laughed again, her amused eyes on Marie's face.\n\n“Dear me, child! don't you know that if men had their way, they'd--well,\nif men married men there'd never be such a thing in the world as a\nshower bouquet or a piece of wedding cake!”\n\nThere was no reply. A little precipitately Marie turned and hurried\naway. A moment later she was laying a restraining hand on Billy, who was\nfilling tall vases with superb long-stemmed roses in the kitchen.\n\n“Billy, please,” she panted, “couldn't we do without those? Couldn't we\nsend them to some--some hospital?--and the wedding cake, too, and--”\n\n“The wedding cake--to some _hospital!_”\n\n“No, of course not--to the hospital. It would make them sick to eat it,\nwouldn't it?” That there was no shadow of a smile on Marie's face showed\nhow desperate, indeed, was her state of mind. “I only meant that I\ndidn't want them myself, nor the shower bouquet, nor the rooms darkened,\nnor little Kate as the flower girl--and would you mind very much if I\nasked you not to be my maid of honor?”\n\n“_Marie!_”\n\nMarie covered her face with her hands then and began to sob brokenly;\nso there was nothing for Billy to do but to take her into her arms with\nsoothing little murmurs and pettings. By degrees, then, the whole story\ncame out.\n\nBilly almost laughed--but she almost cried, too. Then she said:\n\n“Dearie, I don't believe Cyril feels or acts half so bad as Bertram and\nKate make out, and, anyhow, if he did, it's too late now to--to send the\nwedding cake to the hospital, or make any other of the little changes\nyou suggest.” Billy's lips puckered into a half-smile, but her eyes were\ngrave. “Besides, there are your music pupils trimming the living-room\nthis minute with evergreen, there's little Kate making her flower-girl\nwreath, and Mrs. Hartwell stacking cake boxes in the hall, to say\nnothing of Rosa gloating over the best china in the dining-room, and\nAunt Hannah putting purple bows into the new lace cap she's counting\non wearing. Only think how disappointed they'd all be if I should say:\n'Never mind--stop that. Marie's just going to have a minister. No fuss,\nno feathers!' Why, dearie, even the roses are hanging their heads for\ngrief,” she went on mistily, lifting with gentle fingers one of the\nfull-petalled pink beauties near her. “Besides, there's your--guests.”\n\n“Oh, of course, I knew I couldn't--really,” sighed Marie, as she turned\nto go up-stairs, all the light and joy gone from her face.\n\nBilly, once assured that Marie was out of hearing, ran to the telephone.\n\nBertram answered.\n\n“Bertram, tell Cyril I want to speak to him, please.”\n\n“All right, dear, but go easy. Better strike up your tuning fork to find\nhis pitch to-day. You'll discover it's a high one, all right.”\n\nA moment later Cyril's tersely nervous “Good morning, Billy,” came\nacross the line.\n\nBilly drew in her breath and cast a hurriedly apprehensive glance over\nher shoulder to make sure Marie was not near.\n\n“Cyril,” she called in a low voice, “if you care a shred for Marie, for\nheaven's sake call her up and tell her that you dote on pink roses, and\npink ribbons, and pink breakfasts--and pink wedding cake!”\n\n“But I don't.”\n\n“Oh, yes, you do--to-day! You would--if you could see Marie now.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Nothing, only she overheard part of Bertram's nonsensical talk with\nKate a little while ago, and she's ready to cast the last ravelling\nof white satin and conventionality behind her, and go with you to the\njustice of the peace.”\n\n“Sensible girl!”\n\n“Yes, but she can't, you know, with fifty guests coming to the wedding,\nand twice as many more to the reception. Honestly, Cyril, she's\nbroken-hearted. You must do something. She's--coming!” And the receiver\nclicked sharply into place.\n\nFive minutes later Marie was called to the telephone. Dejectedly,\nwistful-eyed, she went. Just what were the words that hummed across the\nwire into the pink little ear of the bride-to-be, Billy never knew;\nbut a Marie that was anything but wistful-eyed and dejected left the\ntelephone a little later, and was heard very soon in the room above\ntrilling merry snatches of a little song. Contentedly, then, Billy went\nback to her roses.\n\nIt was a pretty wedding, a very pretty wedding. Every one said that. The\npink and green of the decorations, the soft lights (Kate had had her way\nabout darkening the rooms), the pretty frocks and smiling faces of the\nguests all helped. Then there were the dainty flower girl, little Kate,\nthe charming maid of honor, Billy, the stalwart, handsome best man,\nBertram, to say nothing of the delicately beautiful bride, who looked\nlike some fairy visitor from another world in the floating shimmer of\nher gossamer silk and tulle. There was, too, not quite unnoticed, the\nbridegroom; tall, of distinguished bearing, and with features that were\nclear cut and-to-day-rather pale.\n\nThen came the reception--the “women and confusion” of Cyril's\nfears--followed by the going away of the bride and groom with its merry\nwarfare of confetti and old shoes.\n\nAt four o'clock, however, with only William and Bertram remaining for\nguests, something like quiet descended at last on the little house.\n\n“Well, it's over,” sighed Billy, dropping exhaustedly into a big chair\nin the living-room.\n\n“And _well_ over,” supplemented Aunt Hannah, covering her white shawl\nwith a warmer blue one.\n\n“Yes, I think it was,” nodded Kate. “It was really a very pretty\nwedding.”\n\n“With your help, Kate--eh?” teased William.\n\n“Well, I flatter myself I did do some good,” bridled Kate, as she turned\nto help little Kate take the flower wreath from her head.\n\n“Even if you did hurry into my room and scare me into conniption fits\ntelling me I'd be late,” laughed Billy.\n\nKate tossed her head.\n\n“Well, how was I to know that Aunt Hannah's clock only meant half-past\neleven when it struck twelve?” she retorted.\n\nEverybody laughed.\n\n“Oh, well, it was a pretty wedding,” declared William, with a long sigh.\n\n“It'll do--for an understudy,” said Bertram softly, for Billy's ears\nalone.\n\nOnly the added color and the swift glance showed that Billy heard, for\nwhen she spoke she said:\n\n“And didn't Cyril behave beautifully? 'Most every time I looked at him\nhe was talking to some woman.”\n\n“Oh, no, he wasn't--begging your pardon, my dear,” objected Bertram. “I\nwatched him, too, even more closely than you did, and it was always the\n_woman_ who was talking to _Cyril!_”\n\nBilly laughed.\n\n“Well, anyhow,” she maintained, “he listened. He didn't run away.”\n\n“As if a bridegroom could!” cried Kate.\n\n“I'm going to,” avowed Bertram, his nose in the air.\n\n“Pooh!” scoffed Kate. Then she added eagerly: “You must be married in\nchurch, Billy, and in the evening.”\n\nBertram's nose came suddenly out of the air. His eyes met Kate's\nsquarely.\n\n“Billy hasn't decided yet how _she_ does want to be married,” he said\nwith unnecessary emphasis.\n\nBilly laughed and interposed a quick change of subject.\n\n“I think people had a pretty good time, too, for a wedding, don't you?”\n she asked. “I was sorry Mary Jane couldn't be here--'twould have been\nsuch a good chance for him to meet our friends.”\n\n“As--_Mary Jane?_” asked Bertram, a little stiffly.\n\n“Really, my dear,” murmured Aunt Hannah, “I think it _would_ be more\nrespectful to call him by his name.”\n\n“By the way, what is his name?” questioned William.\n\n“That's what we don't know,” laughed Billy.\n\n“Well, you know the 'Arkwright,' don't you?” put in Bertram. Bertram,\ntoo, laughed, but it was a little forcedly. “I suppose if you knew his\nname was 'Methuselah,' you wouldn't call him that--yet, would you?”\n\nBilly clapped her hands, and threw a merry glance at Aunt Hannah.\n\n“There! we never thought of 'Methuselah,'” she gurgled gleefully. “Maybe\nit _is_ 'Methuselah,' now--'Methuselah John'! You see, he's told us to\ntry to guess it,” she explained, turning to William; “but, honestly, I\ndon't believe, whatever it is, I'll ever think of him as anything but\n'Mary Jane.'”\n\n“Well, as far as I can judge, he has nobody but himself to thank for\nthat, so he can't do any complaining,” smiled William, as he rose to go.\n“Well, how about it, Bertram? I suppose you're going to stay a while to\ncomfort the lonely--eh, boy?”\n\n“Of course he is--and so are you, too, Uncle William,” spoke up Billy,\nwith affectionate cordiality. “As if I'd let you go back to a forlorn\ndinner in that great house to-night! Indeed, no!”\n\nWilliam smiled, hesitated, and sat down.\n\n“Well, of course--” he began.\n\n“Yes, of course,” finished Billy, quickly. “I'll telephone Pete that\nyou'll stay here--both of you.”\n\nIt was at this point that little Kate, who had been turning interested\neyes from one brother to the other, interposed a clear, high-pitched\nquestion.\n\n“Uncle William, didn't you _want_ to marry my going-to-be-Aunt Billy?”\n\n“Kate!” gasped her mother, “didn't I tell you--” Her voice trailed into\nan incoherent murmur of remonstrance.\n\nBilly blushed. Bertram said a low word under his breath. Aunt Hannah's\n“Oh, my grief and conscience!” was almost a groan.\n\nWilliam laughed lightly.\n\n“Well, my little lady,” he suggested, “let us put it the other way and\nsay that quite probably she didn't want to marry me.”\n\n“Does she want to marry Uncle Bertram?” “Kate!” gasped Billy and Mrs.\nHartwell together this time, fearful of what might be coming next.\n\n“We'll hope so,” nodded Uncle William, speaking in a cheerfully\nmatter-of-fact voice, intended to discourage curiosity.\n\nThe little girl frowned and pondered. Her elders cast about in their\nminds for a speedy change of subject; but their somewhat scattered wits\nwere not quick enough. It was little Kate who spoke next.\n\n“Uncle William, would she have got Uncle Cyril if Aunt Marie hadn't\nnabbed him first?”\n\n“Kate!” The word was a chorus of dismay this time.\n\nMrs. Hartwell struggled to her feet.\n\n“Come, come, Kate, we must go up-stairs--to bed,” she stammered.\n\nThe little girl drew back indignantly.\n\n“To bed? Why, mama, I haven't had my supper yet!”\n\n“What? Oh, sure enough--the lights! I forgot. Well, then, come up--to\nchange your dress,” finished Mrs. Hartwell, as with a despairing look\nand gesture she led her young daughter from the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. M. J. MAKES ANOTHER MOVE\n\n\nBilly came down-stairs on the thirteenth of December to find everywhere\nthe peculiar flatness that always follows a day which for weeks has been\nthe focus of one's aims and thoughts and labor.\n\n“It's just as if everything had stopped at Marie's wedding, and there\nwasn't anything more to do,” she complained to Aunt Hannah at the\nbreakfast table. “Everything seems so--queer!”\n\n“It won't--long, dear,” smiled Aunt Hannah, tranquilly, as she buttered\nher roll, “specially after Bertram comes back. How long does he stay in\nNew York?”\n\n“Only three days; but I'm just sure it's going to seem three weeks,\nnow,” sighed Billy. “But he simply had to go--else he wouldn't have\ngone.”\n\n“I've no doubt of it,” observed Aunt Hannah. And at the meaning\nemphasis of her words, Billy laughed a little. After a minute she said\naggrievedly:\n\n“I had supposed that I could at least have a sort of 'after the ball'\ncelebration this morning picking up and straightening things around.\nBut John and Rosa have done it all. There isn't so much as a rose\nleaf anywhere on the floor. Of course most of the flowers went to\nthe hospital last night, anyway. As for Marie's room--it looks as\nspick-and-span as if it had never seen a scrap of ribbon or an inch of\ntulle.”\n\n“But--the wedding presents?”\n\n“All carried down to the kitchen and half packed now, ready to go over\nto the new home. John says he'll take them over in Peggy this afternoon,\nafter he takes Mrs. Hartwell's trunk to Uncle William's.”\n\n“Well, you can at least go over to the apartment and work,” suggested\nAunt Hannah, hopefully.\n\n“Humph! Can I?” scoffed Billy. “As if I could--when Marie left strict\norders that not one thing was to be touched till she got here. They\narranged everything but the presents before the wedding, anyway; and\nMarie wants to fix those herself after she gets back. Mercy! Aunt\nHannah, if I should so much as move a plate one inch in the china\ncloset, Marie would know it--and change it when she got home,” laughed\nBilly, as she rose from the table. “No, I can't go to work over there.”\n\n“But there's your music, my dear. You said you were going to write some\nnew songs after the wedding.”\n\n“I was,” sighed Billy, walking to the window, and looking listlessly\nat the bare, brown world outside; “but I can't write songs--when there\naren't any songs in my head to write.”\n\n“No, of course not; but they'll come, dear, in time. You're tired, now,”\n soothed Aunt Hannah, as she turned to leave the room.\n\n“It's the reaction, of course,” murmured Aunt Hannah to herself, on the\nway up-stairs. “She's had the whole thing on her hands--dear child!”\n\nA few minutes later, from the living-room, came a plaintive little minor\nmelody. Billy was at the piano.\n\nKate and little Kate had, the night before, gone home with William.\nIt had been a sudden decision, brought about by the realization that\nBertram's trip to New York would leave William alone. Her trunk was to\nbe carried there to-day, and she would leave for home from there, at the\nend of a two or three days' visit.\n\nIt began to snow at twelve o'clock. All the morning the sky had been\ngray and threatening; and the threats took visible shape at noon in\nmyriads of white snow feathers that filled the air to the blinding\npoint, and turned the brown, bare world into a thing of fairylike\nbeauty. Billy, however, with a rare frown upon her face, looked out upon\nit with disapproving eyes.\n\n“I _was_ going in town--and I believe I'll go now,” she cried.\n\n“Don't, dear, please don't,” begged Aunt Hannah. “See, the flakes are\nsmaller now, and the wind is coming up. We're in for a blizzard--I'm\nsure we are. And you know you have some cold, already.”\n\n“All right,” sighed Billy. “Then it's me for the knitting work and the\nfire, I suppose,” she finished, with a whimsicality that did not hide\nthe wistful disappointment of her voice.\n\nShe was not knitting, however, she was sewing with Aunt Hannah when at\nfour o'clock Rosa brought in the card.\n\nBilly glanced at the name, then sprang to her feet with a glad little\ncry.\n\n“It's Mary Jane!” she exclaimed, as Rosa disappeared. “Now wasn't he a\ndear to think to come to-day? You'll be down, won't you?”\n\nAunt Hannah smiled even while she frowned.\n\n“Oh, Billy!” she remonstrated. “Yes, I'll come down, of course, a little\nlater, and I'm glad _Mr. Arkwright_ came,” she said with reproving\nemphasis.\n\nBilly laughed and threw a mischievous glance over her shoulder.\n\n“All right,” she nodded. “I'll go and tell _Mr. Arkwright_ you'll be\ndown directly.”\n\nIn the living-room Billy greeted her visitor with a frankly cordial\nhand.\n\n“How did you know, Mr. Arkwright, that I was feeling specially restless\nand lonesome to-day?” she demanded.\n\nA glad light sprang to the man's dark eyes.\n\n“I didn't know it,” he rejoined. “I only knew that I was specially\nrestless and lonesome myself.”\n\nArkwright's voice was not quite steady. The unmistakable friendliness in\nthe girl's words and manner had sent a quick throb of joy to his heart.\nHer evident delight in his coming had filled him with rapture. He could\nnot know that it was only the chill of the snowstorm that had given\nwarmth to her handclasp, the dreariness of the day that had made her\ngreeting so cordial, the loneliness of a maiden whose lover is away that\nhad made his presence so welcome.\n\n“Well, I'm glad you came, anyway,” sighed Billy, contentedly; “though I\nsuppose I ought to be sorry that you were lonesome--but I'm afraid I'm\nnot, for now you'll know just how I felt, so you won't mind if I'm a\nlittle wild and erratic. You see, the tension has snapped,” she added\nlaughingly, as she seated herself.\n\n“Tension?”\n\n“The wedding, you know. For so many weeks we've been seeing just\nDecember twelfth, that we'd apparently forgotten all about the\nthirteenth that came after it; so when I got up this morning I felt\njust as you do when the clock has stopped ticking. But it was a lovely\nwedding, Mr. Arkwright. I'm sorry you could not be here.”\n\n“Thank you; so am I--though usually, I will confess, I'm not much\ngood at attending 'functions' and meeting strangers. As perhaps you've\nguessed, Miss Neilson, I'm not particularly a society chap.”\n\n“Of course you aren't! People who are doing things--real things--seldom\nare. But we aren't the society kind ourselves, you know--not the capital\nS kind. We like sociability, which is vastly different from liking\nSociety. Oh, we have friends, to be sure, who dote on 'pink teas\nand purple pageants,' as Cyril calls them; and we even go ourselves\nsometimes. But if you had been here yesterday, Mr. Arkwright, you'd have\nmet lots like yourself, men and women who are doing things: singing,\nplaying, painting, illustrating, writing. Why, we even had a poet,\nsir--only he didn't have long hair, so he didn't look the part a bit,”\n she finished laughingly.\n\n“Is long hair--necessary--for poets?” Arkwright's smile was quizzical.\n\n“Dear me, no; not now. But it used to be, didn't it? And for painters,\ntoo. But now they look just like--folks.”\n\nArkwright laughed.\n\n“It isn't possible that you are sighing for the velvet coats and flowing\nties of the past, is it, Miss Neilson?”\n\n“I'm afraid it is,” dimpled Billy. “I _love_ velvet coats and flowing\nties!”\n\n“May singers wear them? I shall don them at once, anyhow, at a venture,”\n declared the man, promptly.\n\nBilly smiled and shook her head.\n\n“I don't think you will. You all like your horrid fuzzy tweeds and\nworsteds too well!”\n\n“You speak with feeling. One would almost suspect that you already had\ntried to bring about a reform--and failed. Perhaps Mr. Cyril, now, or\nMr. Bertram--” Arkwright stopped with a whimsical smile.\n\nBilly flushed a little. As it happened, she had, indeed, had a merry\ntilt with Bertram on that very subject, and he had laughingly promised\nthat his wedding present to her would be a velvet house coat for\nhimself. It was on the point of Billy's tongue now to say this to\nArkwright; but another glance at the provoking smile on his lips drove\nthe words back in angry confusion. For the second time, in the presence\nof this man, Billy found herself unable to refer to her engagement to\nBertram Henshaw--though this time she did not in the least doubt that\nArkwright already knew of it.\n\nWith a little gesture of playful scorn she rose and went to the piano.\n\n“Come, let us try some duets,” she suggested. “That's lots nicer than\nquarrelling over velvet coats; and Aunt Hannah will be down presently to\nhear us sing.”\n\nBefore she had ceased speaking, Arkwright was at her side with an\nexclamation of eager acquiescence.\n\nIt was after the second duet that Arkwright asked, a little diffidently.\n\n“Have you written any new songs lately?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You're going to?”\n\n“Perhaps--if I find one to write.”\n\n“You mean--you have no words?”\n\n“Yes--and no. I have some words, both of my own and other people's; but\nI haven't found in any one of them, yet--a melody.”\n\nArkwright hesitated. His right hand went almost to his inner coat\npocket--then fell back at his side. The next moment he picked up a sheet\nof music.\n\n“Are you too tired to try this?” he asked.\n\nA puzzled frown appeared on Billy's face.\n\n“Why, no, but--”\n\n“Well, children, I've come down to hear the music,” announced Aunt\nHannah, smilingly, from the doorway; “only--Billy, _will_ you run up\nand get my pink shawl, too? This room _is_ colder than I thought, and\nthere's only the white one down here.”\n\n“Of course,” cried Billy, rising at once. “You shall have a dozen\nshawls, if you like,” she laughed, as she left the room.\n\nWhat a cozy time it was--the hour that followed, after Billy returned\nwith the pink shawl! Outside, the wind howled at the windows and flung\nthe snow against the glass in sleety crashes. Inside, the man and the\ngirl sang duets until they were tired; then, with Aunt Hannah, they\nfeasted royally on the buttered toast, tea, and frosted cakes that\nRosa served on a little table before the roaring fire. It was then that\nArkwright talked of himself, telling them something of his studies, and\nof the life he was living.\n\n“After all, you see there's just this difference between my friends\nand yours,” he said, at last. “Your friends _are_ doing things. They've\nsucceeded. Mine haven't, yet--they're only _trying_.”\n\n“But they will succeed,” cried Billy.\n\n“Some of them,” amended the man.\n\n“Not--all of them?” Billy looked a little troubled.\n\nArkwright shook his head slowly.\n\n“No. They couldn't--all of them, you know. Some haven't the talent, some\nhaven't the perseverance, and some haven't the money.”\n\n“But all that seems such a pity-when they've tried,” grieved Billy.\n\n“It is a pity, Miss Neilson. Disappointed hopes are always a pity,\naren't they?”\n\n“Y-yes,” sighed the girl. “But--if there were only something one could\ndo to--help!”\n\nArkwright's eyes grew deep with feeling, but his voice, when he spoke,\nwas purposely light.\n\n“I'm afraid that would be quite too big a contract for even your\ngenerosity, Miss Neilson--to mend all the broken hopes in the world,” he\nprophesied.\n\n“I have known great good to come from great disappointments,” remarked\nAunt Hannah, a bit didactically.\n\n“So have I,” laughed Arkwright, still determined to drive the troubled\nshadow from the face he was watching so intently. “For instance: a\nfellow I know was feeling all cut up last Friday because he was just too\nlate to get into Symphony Hall on the twenty-five-cent admission. Half\nan hour afterwards his disappointment was turned to joy--a friend who\nhad an orchestra chair couldn't use his ticket that day, and so handed\nit over to him.”\n\nBilly turned interestedly.\n\n“What are those twenty-five-cent tickets to the Symphony?”\n\n“Then--you don't know?”\n\n“Not exactly. I've heard of them, in a vague fashion.”\n\n“Then you've missed one of the sights of Boston if you haven't ever\nseen that long line of patient waiters at the door of Symphony Hall of a\nFriday morning.”\n\n“Morning! But the concert isn't till afternoon!”\n\n“No, but the waiting is,” retorted Arkwright. “You see, those admissions\nare limited--five hundred and five, I believe--and they're rush seats,\nat that. First come, first served; and if you're too late you aren't\nserved at all. So the first arrival comes bright and early. I've heard\nthat he has been known to come at peep of day when there's a Paderewski\nor a Melba for a drawing card. But I've got my doubts of that. Anyhow,\nI never saw them there much before half-past eight. But many's the cold,\nstormy day I've seen those steps in front of the Hall packed for hours,\nand a long line reaching away up the avenue.”\n\nBilly's eyes widened.\n\n“And they'll stand all that time and wait?”\n\n“To be sure they will. You see, each pays twenty-five cents at the door,\nuntil the limit is reached, then the rest are turned away. Naturally\nthey don't want to be turned away, so they try to get there early enough\nto be among the fortunate five hundred and five. Besides, the earlier\nyou are, the better seat you are likely to get.”\n\n“But only think of _standing_ all that time!”\n\n“Oh, they bring camp chairs, sometimes, I've heard, and then there are\nthe steps. You don't know what a really fine seat a stone step is--if\nyou have a _big_ enough bundle of newspapers to cushion it with! They\nbring their luncheons, too, with books, papers, and knitting work for\nfine days, I've been told--some of them. All the comforts of home, you\nsee,” smiled Arkwright.\n\n“Why, how--how dreadful!” stammered Billy.\n\n“Oh, but they don't think it's dreadful at all,” corrected Arkwright,\nquickly. “For twenty-five cents they can hear all that you hear down in\nyour orchestra chair, for which you've paid so high a premium.”\n\n“But who--who are they? Where do they come from? Who _would_ go and\nstand hours like that to get a twenty-five-cent seat?” questioned Billy.\n\n“Who are they? Anybody, everybody, from anywhere? everywhere; people\nwho have the music hunger but not the money to satisfy it,” he rejoined.\n“Students, teachers, a little milliner from South Boston, a little\ndressmaker from Chelsea, a housewife from Cambridge, a stranger from the\nuttermost parts of the earth; maybe a widow who used to sit down-stairs,\nor a professor who has seen better days. Really to know that line,\nyou should see it for yourself, Miss Neilson,” smiled Arkwright, as\nhe reluctantly rose to go. “Some Friday, however, before you take your\nseat, just glance up at that packed top balcony and judge by the\nfaces you see there whether their owners think they're getting their\ntwenty-five-cents' worth, or not.”\n\n“I will,” nodded Billy, with a smile; but the smile came from her lips\nonly, not her eyes: Billy was wishing, at that moment, that she owned\nthe whole of Symphony Hall--to give away. But that was like Billy. When\nshe was seven years old she had proposed to her Aunt Ella that they take\nall the thirty-five orphans from the Hampden Falls Orphan Asylum to live\nwith them, so that little Sallie Cook and the other orphans might have\nice cream every day, if they wanted it. Since then Billy had always been\ntrying--in a way--to give ice cream to some one who wanted it.\n\nArkwright was almost at the door when he turned abruptly. His face was\nan abashed red. From his pocket he had taken a small folded paper.\n\n“Do you suppose--in this--you might find--that melody?” he stammered in\na low voice. The next moment he was gone, having left in Billy's fingers\na paper upon which was written in a clear-cut, masculine hand six\nfour-line stanzas.\n\nBilly read them at once, hurriedly, then more carefully.\n\n“Why, they're beautiful,” she breathed, “just beautiful! Where did he\nget them, I wonder? It's a love song--and such a pretty one! I believe\nthere _is_ a melody in it,” she exulted, pausing to hum a line or\ntwo. “There is--I know there is; and I'll write it--for Bertram,” she\nfinished, crossing joyously to the piano.\n\nHalf-way down Corey Hill at that moment, Arkwright was buffeting\nthe wind and snow. He, too, was thinking joyously of those\nstanzas--joyously, yet at the same time fearfully. Arkwright himself had\nwritten those lines--though not for Bertram.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. “MR. BILLY” AND “MISS MARY JANE”\n\n\nOn the fourteenth of December Billy came down-stairs alert, interested,\nand happy. She had received a dear letter from Bertram (mailed on the\nway to New York), the sun was shining, and her fingers were fairly\ntingling to put on paper the little melody that was now surging\nriotously through her brain. Emphatically, the restlessness of the day\nbefore was gone now. Once more Billy's “clock” had “begun to tick.”\n\nAfter breakfast Billy went straight to the telephone and called up\nArkwright. Even one side of the conversation Aunt Hannah did not hear\nvery clearly; but in five minutes a radiant-faced Billy danced into the\nroom.\n\n“Aunt Hannah, just listen! Only think--Mary Jane wrote the words\nhimself, so of course I can use them!”\n\n“Billy, dear, _can't_ you say 'Mr. Arkwright'?” pleaded Aunt Hannah.\n\nBilly laughed and gave the anxious-eyed little old lady an impulsive\nhug.\n\n“Of course! I'll say 'His Majesty' if you like, dear,” she chuckled.\n“But did you hear--did you realize? They're his own words, so there's no\nquestion of rights or permission, or anything. And he's coming up this\nafternoon to hear my melody, and to make a few little changes in the\nwords, maybe. Oh, Aunt Hannah, you don't know how good it seems to get\ninto my music again!”\n\n“Yes, yes, dear, of course; but--” Aunt Hannah's sentence ended in a\nvaguely troubled pause.\n\nBilly turned in surprise.\n\n“Why, Aunt Hannah, aren't you glad? You _said_ you'd be glad!”\n\n“Yes, dear; and I am--very glad. It's only--if it doesn't take too much\ntime--and if Bertram doesn't mind.”\n\nBilly flushed. She laughed a little bitterly.\n\n“No, it won't take too much time, I fancy, and--so far as Bertram is\nconcerned--if what Sister Kate says is true, Aunt Hannah, he'll be glad\nto have me occupy a little of my time with something besides himself.”\n\n“Fiddlededee!” bristled Aunt Hannah.\n\n“What did she mean by that?”\n\nBilly smiled ruefully.\n\n“Well, probably I did need it. She said it night before last just before\nshe went home with Uncle William. She declared that I seemed to forget\nentirely that Bertram belonged to his Art first, before he belonged to\nme; and that it was exactly as she had supposed it would be--a perfect\nabsurdity for Bertram to think of marrying anybody.”\n\n“Fiddlededee!” ejaculated the irate Aunt Hannah, even more sharply. “I\nhope you have too much good sense to mind what Kate says, Billy.”\n\n“Yes, I know,” sighed the girl; “but of course I can see some things for\nmyself, and I suppose I did make--a little fuss about his going to New\nYork the other night. And I will own that I've had a real struggle with\nmyself sometimes, lately, not to mind--his giving so much time to\nhis portrait painting. And of course both of those are very\nreprehensible--in an artist's wife,” she finished, a little tremulously.\n\n“Humph! Well, I don't think I should worry about that,” observed Aunt\nHannah with grim positiveness.\n\n“No, I don't mean to,” smiled Billy, wistfully. “I only told you so\nyou'd understand that it was just as well if I did have something to\ntake up my mind--besides Bertram. And of course music would be the most\nnatural thing.”\n\n“Yes, of course,” agreed Aunt Hannah.\n\n“And it seems actually almost providential that Mary--I mean Mr.\nArkwright is here to help me, now that Cyril is gone,” went on Billy,\nstill a little wistfully.\n\n“Yes, of course. He isn't like--a stranger,” murmured Aunt Hannah. Aunt\nHannah's voice sounded as if she were trying to convince herself--of\nsomething.\n\n“No, indeed! He seems just like one of the family to me, almost as if he\nwere really--your niece, Mary Jane,” laughed Billy.\n\nAunt Hannah moved restlessly.\n\n“Billy,” she hazarded, “he knows, of course, of your engagement?”\n\n“Why, of course he does, Aunt Hannah everybody does!” Billy's eyes were\nplainly surprised.\n\n“Yes, yes, of course--he must,” subsided Aunt Hannah, confusedly, hoping\nthat Billy would not divine the hidden reason behind her question. She\nwas relieved when Billy's next words showed that she had not divined it.\n\n“I told you, didn't I? He's coming up this afternoon. He can't get here\ntill five, though; but he's so interested! He's about as crazy over the\nthing as I am. And it's going to be fine, Aunt Hannah, when it's done.\nYou just wait and see!” she finished gayly, as she tripped from the\nroom.\n\nLeft to herself, Aunt Hannah drew a long breath.\n\n“I'm glad she didn't suspect,” she was thinking. “I believe she'd\nconsider even the _question_ disloyal to Bertram--dear child! And of\ncourse Mary”--Aunt Hannah corrected herself with cheeks aflame--“I mean\nMr. Arkwright does--know.”\n\nIt was just here, however, that Aunt Hannah was mistaken. Mr. Arkwright\ndid not--know. He had not reached Boston when the engagement was\nannounced. He knew none of Billy's friends in town save the Henshaw\nbrothers. He had not heard from Calderwell since he came to Boston. The\nvery evident intimacy of Billy with the Henshaw brothers he accepted as\na matter of course, knowing the history of their acquaintance, and the\nfact that Billy was Mr. William Henshaw's namesake. As to Bertram\nbeing Billy's lover--that idea had long ago been killed at birth by\nCalderwell's emphatic assertion that the artist would never care for any\ngirl--except to paint. Since coming to Boston, Arkwright had seen little\nof the two together. His work, his friends, and his general mode of life\nprecluded that. Because of all this, therefore, Arkwright did not--know;\nwhich was a pity--for Arkwright, and for some others.\n\nPromptly at five o'clock that afternoon, Arkwright rang Billy's\ndoorbell, and was admitted by Rosa to the living-room, where Billy was\nat the piano.\n\nBilly sprang to her feet with a joyous word of greeting.\n\n“I'm so glad you've come,” she sighed happily. “I want you to hear the\nmelody your pretty words have sung to me. Though, maybe, after all, you\nwon't like it, you know,” she finished with arch wistfulness.\n\n“As if I could help liking it,” smiled the man, trying to keep from his\nvoice the ecstatic delight that the touch of her hand had brought him.\n\nBilly shook her head and seated herself again at the piano.\n\n“The words are lovely,” she declared, sorting out two or three sheets of\nmanuscript music from the quantity on the rack before her. “But there's\none place--the rhythm, you know--if you could change it. There!--but\nlisten. First I'm going to play it straight through to you.” And she\ndropped her fingers to the keyboard. The next moment a tenderly sweet\nmelody--with only a chord now and then for accompaniment--filled\nArkwright's soul with rapture. Then Billy began to sing, very softly,\nthe words!\n\nNo wonder Arkwright's soul was filled with rapture. They were his words,\nwrung straight from his heart; and they were being sung by the girl\nfor whom they were written. They were being sung with feeling, too--so\nevident a feeling that the man's pulse quickened, and his eyes flashed a\nsudden fire. Arkwright could not know, of course, that Billy, in her own\nmind, was singing that song--to Bertram Henshaw.\n\nThe fire was still in Arkwright's eyes when the song was ended; but\nBilly very plainly did not see it. With a frowning sigh and a murmured\n“There!” she began to talk of “rhythm” and “accent” and “cadence”; and\nto point out with anxious care why three syllables instead of two were\nneeded at the end of a certain line. From this she passed eagerly to\nthe accompaniment, and Arkwright at once found himself lost in a maze\nof “minor thirds” and “diminished sevenths,” until he was forced to\nturn from the singer to the song. Still, watching her a little later, he\nnoticed her absorbed face and eager enthusiasm, her earnest pursuance of\nan elusive harmony, and he wondered: did she, or did she not sing that\nsong with feeling a little while before?\n\nArkwright had not settled this question to his own satisfaction when\nAunt Hannah came in at half-past five, and he was conscious of a vague\ndisappointment as he rose to greet her. Billy, however, turned an\nuntroubled face to the newcomer.\n\n“We're doing finely, Aunt Hannah,” she cried. Then, suddenly, she flung\na laughing question to the man. “How about it, sir? Are we going to put\non the title-page: 'Words by Mary Jane Arkwright'--or will you unveil\nthe mystery for us now?”\n\n“Have you guessed it?” he bantered.\n\n“No--unless it's 'Methuselah John.' We did think of that the other day.”\n\n“Wrong again!” he laughed.\n\n“Then it'll have to be 'Mary Jane,'” retorted Billy, with calm\nnaughtiness, refusing to meet Aunt Hannah's beseechingly reproving eyes.\nThen suddenly she chuckled. “It would be a combination, wouldn't it?\n'Words by Mary Jane Arkwright. Music by Billy Neilson'! We'd have\nsighing swains writing to 'Dear Miss Arkwright,' telling how touching\nwere _her_ words; and lovelorn damsels thanking _Mr_. Neilson for _his_\nsoul-inspiring music!”\n\n“Billy, my dear!” remonstrated Aunt Hannah, faintly.\n\n“Yes, yes, I know; that was bad--and I won't again, truly,” promised\nBilly. But her eyes danced, and the next moment she had whirled about on\nthe piano stool and dashed into a Chopin waltz. The room itself, then,\nseemed to be full of the twinkling feet of elves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. A GIRL AND A BIT OF LOWESTOFT\n\n\nImmediately after breakfast the next morning, Billy was summoned to the\ntelephone.\n\n“Oh, good morning, Uncle William,” she called, in answer to the\nmasculine voice that replied to her “Hullo.”\n\n“Billy, are you very busy this morning?”\n\n“No, indeed--not if you want me.”\n\n“Well, I do, my dear.” Uncle William's voice was troubled. “I want you\nto go with me, if you can, to see a Mrs. Greggory. She's got a teapot I\nwant. It's a genuine Lowestoft, Harlow says. Will you go?”\n\n“Of course I will! What time?”\n\n“Eleven if you can, at Park Street. She's at the West End. I don't dare\nto put it off for fear I'll lose it. Harlow says others will have to\nknow of it, of course. You see, she's just made up her mind to sell it,\nand asked him to find a customer. I wouldn't trouble you, but he says\nthey're peculiar--the daughter, especially--and may need some careful\nhandling. That's why I wanted you--though I wanted you to see the\ntea-pot, too,--it'll be yours some day, you know.”\n\nBilly, all alone at her end of the line, blushed. That she was one day\nto be mistress of the Strata and all it contained was still anything but\n“common” to her.\n\n“I'd love to see it, and I'll come gladly; but I'm afraid I won't be\nmuch help, Uncle William,” she worried.\n\n“I'll take the risk of that. You see, Harlow says that about half the\ntime she isn't sure she wants to sell it, after all.”\n\n“Why, how funny! Well, I'll come. At eleven, you say, at Park Street?”\n\n“Yes; and thank you, my dear. I tried to get Kate to go, too; but she\nwouldn't. By the way, I'm going to bring you home to luncheon. Kate\nleaves this afternoon, you know, and it's been so snowy she hasn't\nthought best to try to get over to the house. Maybe Aunt Hannah would\ncome, too, for luncheon. Would she?”\n\n“I'm afraid not,” returned Billy, with a rueful laugh. “She's got\n_three_ shawls on this morning, and you know that always means that\nshe's felt a draft somewhere--poor dear. I'll tell her, though, and I'll\nsee you at eleven,” finished Billy, as she hung up the receiver.\n\nPromptly at the appointed time Billy met Uncle William at Park Street,\nand together they set out for the West End street named on the paper in\nhis pocket. But when the shabby house on the narrow little street was\nreached, the man looked about him with a troubled frown.\n\n“I declare, Billy, I'm not sure but we'd better turn back,” he fretted.\n“I didn't mean to take you to such a place as this.”\n\nBilly shivered a little; but after one glance at the man's disappointed\nface she lifted a determined chin.\n\n“Nonsense, Uncle William! Of course you won't turn back. I don't\nmind--for myself; but only think of the people whose _homes_ are here,”\n she finished, just above her breath.\n\nMrs. Greggory was found to be living in two back rooms at the top of\nfour flights of stairs, up which William Henshaw toiled with increasing\nweariness and dismay, punctuating each flight with a despairing: “Billy,\nreally, I think we should turn back!”\n\nBut Billy would not turn back, and at last they found themselves in the\npresence of a white-haired, sweet-faced woman who said yes, she was\nMrs. Greggory; yes, she was. Even as she uttered the words, however,\nshe looked fearfully over her shoulders as if expecting to hear from the\nhall behind them a voice denying her assertion.\n\nMrs. Greggory was a cripple. Her slender little body was poised on two\nonce-costly crutches. Both the worn places on the crutches, and the\nskill with which the little woman swung herself about the room testified\nthat the crippled condition was not a new one.\n\nBilly's eyes were brimming with pity and dismay. Mechanically she had\ntaken the chair toward which Mrs. Greggory had motioned her. She had\ntried not to seem to look about her; but there was not one detail of\nthe bare little room, from its faded rug to the patched but spotless\ntablecloth, that was not stamped on her brain.\n\nMrs. Greggory had seated herself now, and William Henshaw had cleared\nhis throat nervously. Billy did not know whether she herself were the\nmore distressed or the more relieved to hear him stammer:\n\n“We--er--I came from Harlow, Mrs. Greggory. He gave me to understand\nyou had an--er--teapot that--er--” With his eyes on the cracked white\ncrockery pitcher on the table, William Henshaw came to a helpless pause.\n\nA curious expression, or rather, series of expressions crossed Mrs.\nGreggory's face. Terror, joy, dismay, and relief seemed, one after the\nother to fight for supremacy. Relief in the end conquered, though even\nyet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door\nbefore she spoke.\n\n“The Lowestoft! Yes, I'm so glad!--that is, of course I must be glad.\nI'll get it.” Her voice broke as she pulled herself from her chair.\nThere was only despairing sorrow on her face now.\n\nThe man rose at once.\n\n“But, madam, perhaps--don't let me--” I he began stammeringly. “Of\ncourse--Billy!” he broke off in an entirely different voice. “Jove! What\na beauty!”\n\nMrs. Greggory had thrown open the door of a small cupboard near the\ncollector's chair, disclosing on one of the shelves a beautifully shaped\nteapot, creamy in tint, and exquisitely decorated in a rose design. Near\nit set a tray-like plate of the same ware and decoration.\n\n“If you'll lift it down, please, yourself,” motioned Mrs. Greggory. “I\ndon't like to--with these,” she explained, tapping the crutches at her\nside.\n\nWith fingers that were almost reverent in their appreciation, the\ncollector reached for the teapot. His eyes sparkled.\n\n“Billy, look, what a beauty! And it's a Lowestoft, too, the real\nthing--the genuine, true soft paste! And there's the tray--did you\nnotice?” he exulted, turning back to the shelf. “You _don't_ see that\nevery day! They get separated, most generally, you know.”\n\n“These pieces have been in our family for generations,” said Mrs.\nGreggory with an accent of pride. “You'll find them quite perfect, I\nthink.”\n\n“Perfect! I should say they were,” cried the man.\n\n“They are, then--valuable?” Mrs. Greggory's voice shook.\n\n“Indeed they are! But you must know that.”\n\n“I have been told so. Yet to me their chief value, of course, lies in\ntheir association. My mother and my grandmother owned that teapot, sir.”\n Again her voice broke.\n\nWilliam Henshaw cleared his throat.\n\n“But, madam, if you do not wish to sell--” He stopped abruptly. His\nlonging eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china.\n\nMrs. Greggory gave a low cry.\n\n“But I do--that is, I must. Mr. Harlow says that it is valuable, and\nthat it will bring in money; and we need--money.” She threw a quick\nglance toward the hall door, though she did not pause in her remarks. “I\ncan't do much at work that pays. I sew”--she nodded toward the machine\nby the window--“but with only one foot to make it go--You see, the\nother is--is inclined to shirk a little,” she finished with a wistful\nwhimsicality.\n\nBilly turned away sharply. There was a lump in her throat and a smart in\nher eyes. She was conscious suddenly of a fierce anger against--she did\nnot know what, exactly; but she fancied it was against the teapot,\nor against Uncle William for wanting the teapot, or for _not_ wanting\nit--if he did not buy it.\n\n“And so you see, I do very much wish to sell.”\n\nMrs. Greggory said then. “Perhaps you will tell me what it would be\nworth to you,” she concluded tremulously.\n\nThe collector's eyes glowed. He picked up the teapot with careful\nrapture and examined it. Then he turned to the tray. After a moment he\nspoke.\n\n“I have only one other in my collection as rare,” he said. “I paid a\nhundred dollars for that. I shall be glad to give you the same for this,\nmadam.”\n\nMrs. Greggory started visibly.\n\n“A hundred dollars? So much as that?” she cried almost joyously. “Why,\nnothing else that we've had has brought--Of course, if it's worth that\nto you--” She paused suddenly. A quick step had sounded in the hall\noutside. The next moment the door flew open and a young woman, who\nlooked to be about twenty-three or twenty-four years old, burst into the\nroom.\n\n“Mother, only think, I've--” She stopped, and drew back a little.\nHer startled eyes went from one face to another, then dropped to the\nLowestoft teapot in the man's hands. Her expression changed at once. She\nshut the door quickly and hurried forward.\n\n“Mother, what is it? Who are these people?” she asked sharply.\n\nBilly lifted her chin the least bit. She was conscious of a feeling\nwhich she could not name: Billy was not used to being called “these\npeople” in precisely that tone of voice. William Henshaw, too, raised\nhis chin. He, also, was not in the habit of being referred to as “these\npeople.”\n\n“My name is Henshaw, Miss--Greggory, I presume,” he said quietly. “I was\nsent here by Mr. Harlow.”\n\n“About the teapot, my dear, you know,” stammered Mrs. Greggory,\nwetting her lips with an air of hurried apology and conciliation. “This\ngentleman says he will be glad to buy it. Er--my daughter, Alice, Mr.\nHenshaw,” she hastened on, in embarrassed introduction; “and Miss--”\n\n“Neilson,” supplied the man, as she looked at Billy, and hesitated.\n\nA swift red stained Alice Greggory's face. With barely an acknowledgment\nof the introductions she turned to her mother.\n\n“Yes, dear, but that won't be necessary now. As I started to tell you\nwhen I came in, I have two new pupils; and so”--turning to the man again\n“I thank you for your offer, but we have decided not to sell the teapot\nat present.” As she finished her sentence she stepped one side as if to\nmake room for the strangers to reach the door.\n\nWilliam Henshaw frowned angrily--that was the man; but his eyes--the\ncollector's eyes--sought the teapot longingly. Before either the man or\nthe collector could speak, however; Mrs. Greggory interposed quick words\nof remonstrance.\n\n“But, Alice, my dear,” she almost sobbed. “You didn't wait to let me\ntell you. Mr. Henshaw says it is worth a hundred dollars to him. He will\ngive us--a hundred dollars.”\n\n“A hundred dollars!” echoed the girl, faintly.\n\nIt was plain to be seen that she was wavering. Billy, watching the\nlittle scene, with mingled emotions, saw the glance with which the girl\nswept the bare little room; and she knew that there was not a patch or\ndarn or poverty spot in sight, or out of sight, which that glance did\nnot encompass.\n\nBilly was wondering which she herself desired more--that Uncle William\nshould buy the Lowestoft, or that he should not. She knew she wished\nMrs. Greggory to have the hundred dollars. There was no doubt on\nthat point. Then Uncle William spoke. His words carried the righteous\nindignation of the man who thinks he has been unjustly treated, and the\nfinal plea of the collector who sees a coveted treasure slipping from\nhis grasp.\n\n“I am very sorry, of course, if my offer has annoyed you,” he said\nstiffly. “I certainly should not have made it had I not had Mrs.\nGreggory's assurance that she wished to sell the teapot.”\n\nAlice Greggory turned as if stung.\n\n“_Wished to sell!_” She repeated the words with superb disdain. She was\nplainly very angry. Her blue-gray eyes gleamed with scorn, and her whole\nface was suffused with a red that had swept to the roots of her\nsoft hair. “Do you think a woman _wishes_ to sell a thing that she's\ntreasured all her life, a thing that is perhaps the last visible\nreminder of the days when she was living--not merely existing?”\n\n“Alice, Alice, my love!” protested the sweet-faced cripple, agitatedly.\n\n“I can't help it,” stormed the girl, hotly. “I know how much you think\nof that teapot that was grandmother's. I know what it cost you to make\nup your mind to sell it at all. And then to hear these people talk about\nyour _wishing_ to sell it! Perhaps they think, too, we _wish_ to live\nin a place like this; that we _wish_ to have rugs that are darned,\nand chairs that are broken, and garments that are patches instead of\nclothes!”\n\n“Alice!” gasped Mrs. Greggory in dismayed horror.\n\nWith a little outward fling of her two hands Alice Greggory stepped\nback. Her face had grown white again.\n\n“I beg your pardon, of course,” she said in a voice that was bitterly\nquiet. “I should not have spoken so. You are very kind, Mr. Henshaw, but\nI do not think we care to sell the Lowestoft to-day.”\n\nBoth words and manner were obviously a dismissal; and with a puzzled\nsigh William Henshaw picked up his hat. His face showed very clearly\nthat he did not know what to do, or what to say; but it showed, too, as\nclearly, that he longed to do something, or say something. During the\nbrief minute that he hesitated, however, Billy sprang forward.\n\n“Mrs. Greggory, please, won't you let _me_ buy the teapot? And\nthen--won't you keep it for me--here? I haven't the hundred dollars with\nme, but I'll send it right away. You will let me do it, won't you?”\n\nIt was an impulsive speech, and a foolish one, of course, from the\nstandpoint of sense and logic and reasonableness; but it was one that\nmight be expected, perhaps, from Billy.\n\nMrs. Greggory must have divined, in a way, the spirit that prompted it,\nfor her eyes grew wet, and with a choking “Dear child!” she reached out\nand caught Billy's hand in both her own--even while she shook her head\nin denial.\n\nNot so her daughter. Alice Greggory flushed scarlet. She drew herself\nproudly erect.\n\n“Thank you,” she said with crisp coldness; “but, distasteful as darns\nand patches are to us, we prefer them, infinitely, to--charity!”\n\n“Oh, but, please, I didn't mean--you didn't understand,” faltered Billy.\n\nFor answer Alice Greggory walked deliberately to the door and held it\nopen.\n\n“Oh, Alice, my dear,” pleaded Mrs. Greggory again, feebly.\n\n“Come, Billy! We'll bid you good morning, ladies,” said William\nHenshaw then, decisively. And Billy, with a little wistful pat on Mrs.\nGreggory's clasped hands, went.\n\nOnce down the long four flights of stairs and out on the sidewalk,\nWilliam Henshaw drew a long breath.\n\n“Well, by Jove! Billy, the next time I take you curio hunting, it won't\nbe to this place,” he fumed.\n\n“Wasn't it awful!” choked Billy.\n\n“Awful! The girl was the most stubborn, unreasonable, vixenish little\npuss I ever saw. I didn't want her old Lowestoft if she didn't want\nto sell it! But to practically invite me there, and then treat me like\nthat!” scolded the collector, his face growing red with anger. “Still, I\nwas sorry for the poor little old lady. I wish, somehow, she could have\nthat hundred dollars!” It was the man who said this, not the collector.\n\n“So do I,” rejoined Billy, dolefully. “But that girl was so--so queer!”\n she sighed, with a frown. Billy was puzzled. For the first time,\nperhaps, in her life, she knew what it was to have her proffered “ice\ncream” disdainfully refused.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. ONLY A LOVE SONG, BUT--\n\n\nKate and little Kate left for the West on the afternoon of\nthe fifteenth, and Bertram arrived from New York that evening.\nNotwithstanding the confusion of all this, Billy still had time to give\nsome thought to her experience of the morning with Uncle William.\nThe forlorn little room with its poverty-stricken furnishings and its\ncrippled mistress was very vivid in Billy's memory. Equally vivid were\nthe flashing eyes of Alice Greggory as she had opened the door at the\nlast.\n\n“For,” as Billy explained to Bertram that evening, after she had told\nhim the story of the morning's adventure, “you see, dear, I had never\nbeen really _turned out_ of a house before!”\n\n“I should think not,” scowled her lover, indignantly; “and it's safe to\nsay you never will again. The impertinence of it! But then, you won't\nsee them any more, sweetheart, so we'll just forget it.”\n\n“Forget it! Why, Bertram, I couldn't! You couldn't, if you'd been there.\nBesides, of course I shall see them again!”\n\nBertram's jaw dropped.\n\n“Why, Billy, you don't mean that Will, or you either, would try again\nfor that trumpery teapot!”\n\n“Of course not,” flashed Billy, heatedly. “It isn't the teapot--it's\nthat dear little Mrs. Greggory. Why, dearie, you don't know how poor\nthey are! Everything in sight is so old and thin and worn it's enough to\nbreak your heart. The rug isn't anything but darns, nor the tablecloth,\neither--except patches. It's awful, Bertram!”\n\n“I know, darling; but _you_ don't expect to buy them new rugs and new\ntablecloths, do you?”\n\nBilly gave one of her unexpected laughs.\n\n“Mercy!” she chuckled. “Only picture Miss Alice's face if I _should_ try\nto buy them rugs and tablecloths! No, dear,” she went on more seriously,\n“I sha'n't do that, of course--though I'd like to; but I shall try to\nsee Mrs. Greggory again, if it's nothing more than a rose or a book or a\nnew magazine that I can take to her.”\n\n“Or a smile--which I fancy will be the best gift of the lot,” amended\nBertram, fondly.\n\nBilly dimpled and shook her head.\n\n“Smiles--my smiles--are not so valuable, I'm afraid--except to you,\nperhaps,” she laughed.\n\n“Self-evident facts need no proving,” retorted Bertram. “Well, and what\nelse has happened in all these ages I've been away?”\n\nBilly brought her hands together with a sudden cry.\n\n“Oh, and I haven't told you!” she exclaimed. “I'm writing a new song--a\nlove song. Mary Jane wrote the words. They're beautiful.”\n\nBertram stiffened.\n\n“Indeed! And is--Mary Jane a poet, with all the rest?” he asked, with\naffected lightness.\n\n“Oh, no, of course not,” smiled Billy; “but these words _are_ pretty.\nAnd they just sang themselves into the dearest little melody right away.\nSo I'm writing the music for them.”\n\n“Lucky Mary Jane!” murmured Bertram, still with a lightness that he\nhoped would pass for indifference. (Bertram was ashamed of himself, but\ndeep within him was a growing consciousness that he knew the meaning\nof the vague irritation that he always felt at the mere mention of\nArkwright's name.) “And will the title-page say, 'Words by Mary Jane\nArkwright'?” he finished.\n\n“That's what I asked him,” laughed Billy.\n\n\n“I even suggested 'Methuselah John' for a change. Oh, but, dearie,” she\nbroke off with shy eagerness, “I just want you to hear a little of what\nI've done with it. You see, really, all the time, I suspect, I've been\nsinging it--to you,” she confessed with an endearing blush, as she\nsprang lightly to her feet and hurried to the piano.\n\nIt was a bad ten minutes that Bertram Henshaw spent then. How he could\nlove a song and hate it at the same time he did not understand; but he\nknew that he was doing exactly that. To hear Billy carol “Sweetheart, my\nsweetheart!” with that joyous tenderness was bliss unspeakable--until he\nremembered that Arkwright wrote the “Sweetheart, my sweetheart!” then it\nwas--(Even in his thoughts Bertram bit the word off short. He was not a\nswearing man.) When he looked at Billy now at the piano, and thought of\nher singing--as she said she had sung--that song to him all through the\nlast three days, his heart glowed. But when he looked at her and thought\nof Arkwright, who had made possible that singing, his heart froze with\nterror.\n\nFrom the very first it had been music that Bertram had feared. He could\nnot forget that Billy herself had once told him that never would she\nlove any man better than she loved her music; that she was not going\nto marry. All this had been at the first--the very first. He had boldly\nscorned the idea then, and had said:\n\n“So it's music--a cold, senseless thing of spidery marks on clean white\npaper--that is my only rival!”\n\nHe had said, too, that he was going to win. And he had won--but\nnot until after long weeks of fearing, hoping, striving, and\ndespairing--this last when Kate's blundering had nearly made her\nWilliam's wife. Then, on that memorable day in September, Billy had\nwalked straight into his arms; and he knew that he had, indeed, won.\nThat is, he had supposed that he knew--until Arkwright came.\n\nVery sharply now, as he listened to Billy's singing, Bertram told\nhimself to be reasonable, to be sensible; that Billy did, indeed, love\nhim. Was she not, according to her own dear assertion, singing that song\nto him? But it was Arkwright's song. He remembered that, too--and grew\nfaint at the thought. True, he had won when his rival, music, had been\na “cold, senseless thing of spidery marks” on paper; but would that\nwinning stand when “music” had become a thing of flesh and blood--a man\nof undeniable charm, good looks, and winsomeness; a man whose thoughts,\naims, and words were the personification of the thing Billy, in the long\nago, had declared she loved best of all--music?\n\nBertram shivered as with a sudden chill; then Billy rose from the piano.\n\n“There!” she breathed, her face shyly radiant with the glory of the\nsong. “Did you--like it?”\n\nBertram did his best; but, in his state of mind, the very radiance of\nher face was only an added torture, and his tongue stumbled over the\nwords of praise and appreciation that he tried to say. He saw, then, the\nhappy light in Billy's eyes change to troubled questioning and grieved\ndisappointment; and he hated himself for a jealous brute. More earnestly\nthan ever, now, he tried to force the ring of sincerity into his voice;\nbut he knew that he had miserably failed when he heard her falter:\n\n“Of course, dear, I--I haven't got it nearly perfected yet. It'll be\nmuch better, later.”\n\n“But it s{sic} fine, now, sweetheart--indeed it is,” protested Bertram,\nhurriedly.\n\n“Well, of course I'm glad--if you like it,” murmured Billy; but the glow\ndid not come back to her face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. SUGARPLUMS\n\n\nThose short December days after Bertram's return from New York were busy\nones for everybody. Miss Winthrop was not in town to give sittings for\nher portrait, it is true; but her absence only afforded Bertram time and\nopportunity to attend to other work that had been more or less delayed\nand neglected. He was often at Hillside, however, and the lovers managed\nto snatch many an hour of quiet happiness from the rush and confusion of\nthe Christmas preparations.\n\nBertram was assuring himself now that his jealous fears of Arkwright\nwere groundless. Billy seldom mentioned the man, and, as the days\npassed, she spoke only once of his being at the house. The song, too,\nshe said little of; and Bertram--though he was ashamed to own it to\nhimself--breathed more freely.\n\nThe real facts of the case were that Billy had told Arkwright that she\nshould have no time to give attention to the song until after Christmas;\nand her manner had so plainly shown him that she considered himself\nsynonymous with the song, that he had reluctantly taken the hint and\nkept away.\n\n“I'll make her care for me sometime--for something besides a song,” he\ntold himself with fierce consolation--but Billy did not know this.\n\nAside from Bertram, Christmas filled all of Billy's thoughts these days.\nThere were such a lot of things she wished to do.\n\n“But, after all, they're only sugarplums, you know, that I'm giving,\ndear,” she declared to Bertram one day, when he had remonstrated with\nwith her for so taxing her time and strength. “I can't really do much.”\n\n“Much!” scoffed Bertram.\n\n“But it isn't much, honestly--compared to what there is to do,” argued\nBilly. “You see, dear, it's just this,” she went on, her bright face\nsobering a little. “There are such a lot of people in the world who\naren't really poor. That is, they have bread, and probably meat, to eat,\nand enough clothes to keep them warm. But when you've said that, you've\nsaid it all. Books, music, fun, and frosting on their cake they know\nnothing about--except to long for them.”\n\n“But there are the churches and the charities, and all those long-named\nSocieties--I thought that was what they were for,” declared Bertram,\nstill a little aggrievedly, his worried eyes on Billy's tired face.\n\n“Oh, but the churches and charities don't frost cakes nor give\nsugarplums,” smiled Billy. “And it's right that they shouldn't, too,”\n she added quickly. “They have more than they can do now with the roast\nbeef and coal and flannel petticoats that are really necessary.”\n\n“And so it's just frosting and sugarplums, is it--these books and\nmagazines and concert tickets and lace collars for the crippled boy, the\nspinster lady, the little widow, and all the rest of those people who\nwere here last summer?”\n\nBilly turned in confused surprise.\n\n“Why, Bertram, however in the world did you find out about all--that?”\n\n“I didn't. I just guessed it--and it seems 'the boy guessed right the\nvery first time,'” laughed Bertram, teasingly, but with a tender light\nin his eyes. “Oh, and I suppose you'll be sending a frosted cake to the\nLowestoft lady, too, eh?”\n\nBilly's chin rose to a defiant stubbornness.\n\n“I'm going to try to--if I can find out what kind of frosting she\nlikes.”\n\n“How about the Alice lady--or perhaps I should say, the Lady Alice?”\n smiled the man.\n\nBilly relaxed visibly.\n\n“Yes, I know,” she sighed. “There is--the Lady Alice. But, anyhow, she\ncan't call a Christmas present 'charity'--not if it's only a little bit\nof frosting!” Billy's chin came up again.\n\n“And you're going to, really, dare to send her something?”\n\n“Yes,” avowed Billy. “I'm going down there one of these days, in the\nmorning--”\n\n“You're going down there! Billy--not alone?”\n\n“Yes. Why not?”\n\n“But, dearie, you mustn't. It was a horrid place, Will says.”\n\n“So it was horrid--to live in. It was everything that was cheap and mean\nand forlorn. But it was quiet and respectable. 'Tisn't as if I didn't\nknow the way, Bertram; and I'm sure that where that poor crippled woman\nand daughter are safe, I shall be. Mrs. Greggory is a lady, Bertram,\nwell-born and well-bred, I'm sure--and that's the pity of it, to have\nto live in a place like that! They have seen better days, I know. Those\npitiful little worn crutches of hers were mahogany, I'm sure, Bertram,\nand they were silver mounted.”\n\nBertram made a restless movement.\n\n“I know, dear; but if you had some one with you! It wouldn't do for\nWill, of course, nor me--under the circumstances. But there's Aunt\nHannah--” He paused hopefully.\n\nBilly chuckled.\n\n“Bless your dear heart! Aunt Hannah would call for a dozen shawls in\nthat place--if she had breath enough to call for any after she got to\nthe top of those four flights!”\n\n“Yes, I suppose so,” rejoined Bertram, with an unwilling smile.\n“Still--well, you _can_ take Rosa,” he concluded decisively.\n\n“How Miss Alice would like that--to catch me going 'slumming' with\nmy maid!” cried Billy, righteous indignation in her voice. “Honestly,\nBertram, I think even gentle Mrs. Greggory wouldn't stand for that.”\n\n“Then leave Rosa outside in the hall,” planned Bertram, promptly; and\nafter a few more arguments, Billy finally agreed to this.\n\nIt was with Rosa, therefore, that she set out the next morning for the\nlittle room up four flights on the narrow West End street.\n\nLeaving the maid on the top stair of the fourth flight, Billy tapped\nat Mrs. Greggory's door. To her joy Mrs. Greggory herself answered the\nknock.\n\n“Oh! Why--why, good morning,” murmured the lady, in evident\nembarrassment. “Won't you--come m?”\n\n“Thank you. May I?--just a minute?” smiled Billy, brightly.\n\nAs she entered the room, Billy threw a hasty look about her. There was\nno one but themselves present. With a sigh of satisfaction, therefore,\nthe girl took the chair Mrs. Greggory offered, and began to speak.\n\n“I was down this way--that is, I came this way this morning,” she began\na little hastily; “and I wanted just to come up and tell you how sorry\nI was about--about that teapot the other day. We didn't want it, of\ncourse--if you didn't want us to have it.”\n\nA swift change crossed Mrs. Greggory's perturbed face.\n\n“Oh, then you didn't come for it again--to-day,” she said. “I'm so glad!\nI didn't want to refuse--_you_.”\n\n“Indeed I didn't come for it--and we sha'n't again. Don't worry about\nthat, please.”\n\nMrs. Greggory sighed.\n\n“I'm afraid you thought me very rude and--and impossible the other day,”\n she stammered. “And please let me take this opportunity right now to\napologize for my daughter. She was overwrought and excited. She didn't\nknow what she was saying or doing, I'm sure. She was ashamed, I think\nafter you left.”\n\nBilly raised a quick hand of protest.\n\n“Don't, please don't, Mrs. Greggory,” she begged.\n\n“But it was our fault that you came. We _asked_ you to come--through Mr.\nHarlow,” rejoined the other, hurriedly. “And Mr. Henshaw--was that his\nname?--was so kind in every way. I'm glad of this chance to tell you how\nmuch we really did appreciate it--and _your_ offer, too, which we could\nnot, of course, accept,” she finished, the bright color flooding her\ndelicate face.\n\nAgain Billy raised a protesting hand; but the little woman in the\nopposite chair hurried on. There was still more, evidently, that she\nwished to say.\n\n“I hope Mr. Henshaw did not feel too disappointed--about the Lowestoft.\nWe didn't want to let it go if we could help it; and we hope now to keep\nit.”\n\n“Of course,” murmured Billy, sympathetically.\n\n“My daughter knew, you see, how much I have always thought of it, and\nshe was determined that I should not give it up. She said I should\nhave that much left, anyway. You see--my daughter is very unreconciled,\nstill, to things as they are; and no wonder, perhaps. They are so\ndifferent--from what they were!” Her voice broke a little.\n\n“Of course,” said Billy again, and this time the words were tinged with\nimpatient indignation. “If only there were something one could do to\nhelp!”\n\n“Thank you, my dear, but there isn't--indeed there isn't,” rejoined\nthe other, quickly; and Billy, looking into the proudly lifted face,\nrealized suddenly that daughter Alice had perhaps inherited some traits\nfrom mother. “We shall get along very well, I am sure. My daughter\nhas still another pupil. She will be home soon to tell you herself,\nperhaps.”\n\nBilly rose with a haste so marked it was almost impolite, as she\nmurmured:\n\n“Will she? I'm afraid, though, that I sha'n't see her, after all, for I\nmust go. And may I leave these, please?” she added, hurriedly unpinning\nthe bunch of white carnations from her coat. “It seems a pity to let\nthem wilt, when you can put them in water right here.” Her studiously\ncasual voice gave no hint that those particular pinks had been bought\nless than half an hour before of a Park Street florist so that Mrs.\nGreggory _might_ put them in water--right there.\n\n“Oh, oh, how lovely!” breathed Mrs. Greggory, her face deep in the\nfeathery bed of sweetness. Before she could half say “Thank you,”\n however? she found herself alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. ALICE GREGGORY\n\n\nChristmas came and went; and in a flurry of snow and sleet January\narrived. The holidays over, matters and things seemed to settle down to\nthe winter routine.\n\nMiss Winthrop had prolonged her visit in Washington until after\nChristmas, but she had returned to Boston now--and with her she had\nbrought a brand-new idea for her portrait; an idea that caused her to\nsweep aside with superb disdain all poses and costumes and sketches to\ndate, and announce herself with disarming winsomeness as “all ready now\nto really begin!”\n\nBertram Henshaw was vexed, but helpless. Decidedly he wished to paint\nMiss Marguerite Winthrop's portrait; but to attempt to paint it when all\nmatters were not to the lady's liking were worse than useless, unless\nhe wished to hang this portrait in the gallery of failures along with\nAnderson's and Fullam's--and that was not the goal he had set for it. As\nto the sordid money part of the affair--the great J. G. Winthrop himself\nhad come to the artist, and in one terse sentence had doubled the\noriginal price and expressed himself as hopeful that Henshaw would put\nup with “the child's notions.” It was the old financier's next sentence,\nhowever, that put the zest of real determination into Bertram, for\nbecause of it, the artist saw what this portrait was going to mean to\nthe stern old man, and how dear was the original of it to a heart that\nwas commonly reported “on the street” to be made of stone.\n\nObviously, then, indeed, there was nothing for Bertram Henshaw to do\nbut to begin the new portrait. And he began it--though still, it must be\nconfessed, with inward questionings. Before a week had passed, however,\nevery trace of irritation had fled, and he was once again the absorbed\nartist who sees the vision of his desire taking palpable shape at the\nend of his brush.\n\n“It's all right,” he said to Billy then, one evening. “I'm glad she\nchanged. It's going to be the best, the very best thing I've ever\ndone--I think! by the sketches.”\n\n“I'm so glad!” exclaimed Billy. “I'm so glad!” The repetition was\nso vehement that it sounded almost as if she were trying to convince\nherself as well as Bertram of something that was not true.\n\nBut it was true--Billy told herself very indignantly that it was; indeed\nit was! Yet the very fact that she had to tell herself this, caused her\nto know how perilously near she was to being actually jealous of that\nportrait of Marguerite Winthrop. And it shamed her.\n\nVery sternly these days Billy reminded herself of what Kate had\nsaid about Bertram's belonging first to his Art. She thought with\nmortification, too, that it _did_ look as if she were not the proper\nwife for an artist if she were going to feel like this--always. Very\nresolutely, then, Billy turned to her music. This was all the more\neasily done, for, not only did she have her usual concerts and the opera\nto enjoy, but she had become interested in an operetta her club was\nabout to give; also she had taken up the new song again. Christmas being\nover, Mr. Arkwright had been to the house several times. He had changed\nsome of the words and she had improved the melody. The work on the\naccompaniment was progressing finely now, and Billy was so glad!--when\nshe was absorbed in her music she forgot sometimes that she was ever so\nunfit an artist's sweetheart as to be--jealous of a portrait.\n\nIt was quite early in the month that the usually expected “January thaw”\n came, and it was on a comparatively mild Friday at this time that a\nmatter of business took Billy into the neighborhood of Symphony Hall at\nabout eleven o'clock in the morning. Dismissing John and the car upon\nher arrival, she said that she would later walk to the home of a friend\nnear by, where she would remain until it was time for the Symphony\nConcert.\n\nThis friend was a girl whom Billy had known at school. She was studying\nnow at the Conservatory of Music; and she had often urged Billy to come\nand have luncheon with her in her tiny apartment, which she shared with\nthree other girls and a widowed aunt for housekeeper. On this particular\nFriday it had occurred to Billy that, owing to her business appointment\nat eleven and the Symphony Concert at half-past two, the intervening\ntime would give her just the opportunity she had been seeking to\nenable her to accept her friend's invitation. A question asked, and\nenthusiastically answered in the affirmative, over the telephone that\nmorning, therefore, had speedily completed arrangements, and she had\nagreed to be at her friend's door by twelve o'clock, or before.\n\nAs it happened, business did not take quite so long as she had expected,\nand half-past eleven found her well on her way to Miss Henderson's home.\n\nIn spite of the warm sunshine and the slushy snow in the streets, there\nwas a cold, raw wind, and Billy was beginning to feel thankful that she\nhad not far to go when she rounded a corner and came upon a long line of\nhumanity that curved itself back and forth on the wide expanse of steps\nbefore Symphony Hall and then stretched itself far up the Avenue.\n\n“Why, what--” she began under her breath; then suddenly she understood.\nIt was Friday. A world-famous pianist was to play with the Symphony\nOrchestra that afternoon. This must be the line of patient waiters for\nthe twenty-five-cent balcony seats that Mr. Arkwright had told about.\nWith sympathetic, interested eyes, then, Billy stepped one side to watch\nthe line, for a moment.\n\nAlmost at once two girls brushed by her, and one was saying:\n\n“What a shame!--and after all our struggles to get here! If only we\nhadn't lost that other train!”\n\n“We're too late--you no need to hurry!” the other wailed shrilly to a\nthird girl who was hastening toward them. “The line is 'way beyond\nthe Children's Hospital and around the corner now--and the ones there\n_never_ get in!”\n\nAt the look of tragic disappointment that crossed the third girl's face,\nBilly's heart ached. Her first impulse, of course, was to pull her\nown symphony ticket from her muff and hurry forward with a “Here, take\nmine!” But that _would_ hardly do, she knew--though she would like to\nsee Aunt Hannah's aghast face if this girl in the red sweater and white\ntam-o'-shanter should suddenly emerge from among the sumptuous satins\nand furs and plumes that afternoon and claim the adjacent orchestra\nchair. But it was out of the question, of course. There was only one\nseat, and there were three girls, besides all those others. With a sigh,\nthen, Billy turned her eyes back to those others--those many others that\nmade up the long line stretching its weary length up the Avenue.\n\nThere were more women than men, yet the men were there: jolly young men\nwho were plainly students; older men whose refined faces and threadbare\novercoats hinted at cultured minds and starved bodies; other men who\nshowed no hollows in their cheeks nor near-holes in their garments. It\nseemed to Billy that women of almost all sorts were there, young, old,\nand middle-aged; students in tailored suits, widows in crape and veil;\ngirls that were members of a merry party, women that were plainly\nforlorn and alone.\n\nSome in the line shuffled restlessly; some stood rigidly quiet. One had\nbrought a camp stool; many were seated on the steps. Beyond, where the\nline passed an open lot, a wooden fence afforded a convenient prop. One\nread a book, another a paper. Three were studying what was probably\nthe score of the symphony or of the concerto they expected to hear that\nafternoon.\n\nA few did not appear to mind the biting wind, but most of them, by\nturned-up coat-collars or bent heads, testified to the contrary. Not\nfar from Billy a woman nibbled a sandwich furtively, while beyond her a\ngroup of girls were hilariously merry over four triangles of pie which\nthey held up where all might see.\n\nMany of the faces were youthful, happy, and alert with anticipation;\nbut others carried a wistfulness and a weariness that made Billy's heart\nache. Her eyes, indeed, filled with quick tears. Later she turned to go,\nand it was then that she saw in the line a face that she knew--a face\nthat drooped with such a white misery of spent strength that she hurried\nstraight toward it with a low cry.\n\n“Miss Greggory!” she exclaimed, when she reached the girl. “You look\nactually ill. Are you ill?”\n\nFor a brief second only dazed questioning stared from the girl's\nblue-gray eyes. Billy knew when the recognition came, for she saw the\npainful color stain the white face red.\n\n“Thank you, no. I am not ill, Miss Neilson,” said the girl, coldly.\n\n“But you look so tired out!”\n\n“I have been standing here some time; that is all.”\n\nBilly threw a hurried glance down the far-reaching line that she\nknew had formed since the girl's two tired feet had taken their first\nposition.\n\n“But you must have come--so early! It isn't twelve o'clock yet,” she\nfaltered.\n\nA slight smile curved Alice Greggory's lips.\n\n“Yes, it was early,” she rejoined a little bitterly; “but it had to be,\nyou know. I wanted to hear the music; and with this soloist, and this\nweather, I knew that many others--would want to hear the music, too.”\n\n“But you look so white! How much longer--when will they let you in?”\n demanded Billy, raising indignant eyes to the huge, gray-pillared\nbuilding before her, much as if she would pull down the walls if she\ncould, and make way for this tired girl at her side.\n\nMiss Greggory's thin shoulders rose and fell in an expressive shrug.\n\n“Half-past one.”\n\nBilly gave a dismayed cry.\n\n“Half-past one--almost two hours more! But, Miss Greggory, you\ncan't--how can you stand it till then? You've shivered three times since\nI came, and you look as if you were going to faint away.”\n\nMiss Greggory shook her head.\n\n“It is nothing, really,” she insisted. “I am quite well. It is only--I\ndidn't happen to feel like eating much breakfast this morning; and that,\nwith no luncheon--” She let a gesture finish her sentence.\n\n“No luncheon! Why--oh, you couldn't leave your place, of course,”\n frowned Billy.\n\n“No, and”--Alice Greggory lifted her head a little proudly--“I do not\ncare to eat--here.” Her scornful eyes were on one of the pieces of pie\ndown the line--no longer a triangle.\n\n“Of course not,” agreed Billy, promptly. She paused, frowned, and\nbit her lip. Suddenly her face cleared. “There! the very thing,” she\nexulted. “You shall have my ticket this afternoon, Miss Greggory, then\nyou won't have to stay here another minute. Meanwhile, there is an\nexcellent restaurant--”\n\n“Thank you--no. I couldn't do that,” cut in the other, sharply, but in a\nlow voice.\n\n“But you'll take my ticket,” begged Billy.\n\nMiss Greggory shook her head.\n\n“Certainly not.”\n\n“But I want you to, please. I shall be very unhappy if you don't,”\n grieved Billy.\n\nThe other made a peremptory gesture.\n\n“_I_ should be very unhappy if I did,” she said with cold emphasis.\n“Really, Miss Neilson,” she went on in a low voice, throwing an\napprehensive glance at the man ahead, who was apparently absorbed in his\nnewspaper, “I'm afraid I shall have to ask you to let me go on in my own\nway. You are very kind, but there is nothing you can do; nothing. You\nwere very kind, too, of course, to send the book and the flowers to\nmother at Christmas; but--”\n\n“Never mind that, please,” interrupted Billy, hurriedly. Billy's head\nwas lifted now. Her eyes were no longer pleading. Her round little chin\nlooked square and determined. “If you simply will not take my ticket\nthis afternoon, you _must_ do this. Go to some restaurant near here and\nget a good luncheon--something that will sustain you. I will take your\nplace here.”\n\n“_Miss Neilson!_”\n\nBilly smiled radiantly. It was the first time she had ever seen\nAlice Greggory's haughtily cold reserve break into anything like\nnaturalness--the astonished incredulity of that “Miss Neilson!” was\nplainly straight from the heart; so, too, were the amazed words that\nfollowed.\n\n“_You_--will stand _here?_”\n\n“Certainly; I will keep your place. Don't worry. You sha'n't lose it.”\n Billy spoke with a smiling indifference that was meant to convey the\nimpression that standing in line for a twenty-five-cent seat was a\ndaily habit of hers. “There's a restaurant only a little way--right down\nthere,” she finished. And before the dazed Alice Greggory knew quite\nwhat was happening she found herself outside the line, and the other in\nher place.\n\n“But, Miss Neilson, I can't--you mustn't--” she stammered; then, because\nof something in the unyieldingness of the square young chin above the\nsealskin coat, and because she could not (she knew) use actual force\nto drag the owner of that chin out of the line, she bowed her head in\nacquiescence.\n\n“Well, then--I will, long enough for some coffee and maybe a sandwich.\nAnd--thank you,” she choked, as she turned and hurried away.\n\nBilly drew the deep breath of one who has triumphed after long\nstruggles--but the breath broke off short in a gasp of dismay: coming\nstraight up the Avenue toward her was the one person in the world Billy\nwished least to see at that moment--Bertram Henshaw. Billy remembered\nthen that she had twice lately heard her lover speak of calling at the\nBoston Opera House concerning a commission to paint an ideal head to\nrepresent “Music” for some decorative purpose. The Opera House was only\na short distance up the Avenue. Doubtless he was on his way there now.\n\nHe was very near by this time, and Billy held her breath suspended.\nThere was a chance, of course, that he might not notice her; and Billy\nwas counting on that chance--until a gust of wind whirled a loose\nhalf-sheet of newspaper from the hands of the man in front of her, and\nnaturally attracted Bertram's eyes to its vicinity--and to hers. The\nnext moment he was at her side and his dumfounded but softly-breathed\n“_Billy!_” was in her ears.\n\nBilly bubbled into low laughter--there were such a lot of funny\nsituations in the world, and of them all this one was about the\ndrollest, she thought.\n\n“Yes, I know,” she gurgled. “You don't have to say it-your face is\nsaying even more than your tongue _could!_ This is just for a girl I\nknow. I'm keeping her place.”\n\nBertram frowned. He looked as if he were meditating picking Billy up and\nwalking off with her.\n\n“But, Billy,” he protested just above his breath, “this isn't sugarplums\nnor frosting; it's plain suicide--standing out in this wind like\nthis! Besides--” He stopped with an angrily despairing glance at her\nsurroundings.\n\n“Yes, I know,” she nodded, a little soberly, understanding the look and\nanswering that first; “it isn't pleasant nor comfortable, in lots of\nways--but _she's_ had it all the morning. As for the cold--I'm as warm\nas toast. It won't be long, anyway; she's just gone to get something to\neat. Then I'm going to May Henderson's for luncheon.”\n\nBertram sighed impatiently and opened his lips--only to close them with\nthe words unsaid. There was nothing he could do, and he had already said\ntoo much, he thought, with a savage glance at the man ahead who still\nhad enough of his paper left to serve for a pretence at reading. As\nBertram could see, however, the man was not reading a word--he was too\nacutely conscious of the handsome young woman in the long sealskin\ncoat behind him. Billy was already the cynosure of dozens of eyes, and\nBertram knew that his own arrival on the scene had not lessened the\ninterest of the owners of those eyes. He only hoped devoutly that no\none in the line knew him ar Billy, and that no one quite knew what had\nhappened. He did not wish to see himself and his fiancée the subject\nof inch-high headlines in some evening paper figuring as:\n\n“Talented young composer and her famous artist lover take poor girl's\nplace in a twenty-five-cent ticket line.”\n\nHe shivered at the thought.\n\n“Are you cold?” worried Billy. “If you are, don't stand here, please!”\n\nHe shook his head silently. His eyes were searching the street for the\nonly one whose coming could bring him relief.\n\nIt must have been but a coffee-and-sandwich luncheon for the girl, for\nsoon she came. The man surmised that it was she, as soon as he saw her,\nand stepped back at once. He had no wish for introductions. A moment\nlater the girl was in Billy's place, and Billy herself was at his side.\n\n“That was Alice Greggory, Bertram,” she told him, as they walked on\nswiftly; “and Bertram, she was actually almost _crying_ when she took my\nplace.”\n\n“Humph! Well, I should think she'd better be,” growled Bertram,\nperversely.\n\n“Pooh! It didn't hurt me any, dearie,” laughed Billy with a conciliatory\npat on his arm as they turned down the street upon which her friend\nlived. “And now can you come in and see May a minute?”\n\n“I'm afraid not,” regretted Bertram. “I wish I could, but I'm busier\nthan busy to-day--and I was _supposed_ to be already late when I saw\nyou. Jove, Billy, I just couldn't believe my eyes!”\n\n“You looked it,” twinkled Billy. “It was worth a farm just to see your\nface!”\n\n“I'd want the farm--if I was going through that again,” retorted the\nman, grimly--Bertram was still seeing that newspaper heading.\n\nBut Billy only laughed again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. ARKWRIGHT TELLS A STORY\n\n\nArkwright called Monday afternoon by appointment; and together he and\nBilly put the finishing touches to the new song.\n\nIt was when, with Aunt Hannah, they were having tea before the fire\na little later, that Billy told of her adventure the preceding Friday\nafternoon in front of Symphony Hall.\n\n“You knew the girl, of course--I think you said you knew the girl,”\n ventured Arkwright.\n\n“Oh, yes. She was Alice Greggory. I met her with Uncle William first,\nover a Lowestoft teapot. Maybe you'd like to know _how_ I met her,”\n smiled Billy.\n\n“Alice Greggory?” Arkwright's eyes showed a sudden interest. “I used to\nknow an Alice Greggory, but it isn't the same one, probably. Her mother\nwas a cripple.”\n\nBilly gave a little cry.\n\n“Why, it is--it must be! _My_ Alice Greggory's mother is a cripple. Oh,\ndo you know them, really?”\n\n“Well, it does look like it,” rejoined Arkwright, showing even deeper\ninterest. “I haven't seen them for four or five years. They used to live\nin our town. The mother was a little sweet-faced woman with young eyes\nand prematurely white hair.”\n\n“That describes my Mrs. Greggory exactly,” cried Billy's eager voice.\n“And the daughter?”\n\n“Alice? Why--as I said, it's been four years since I've seen her.” A\ntouch of constraint had come into Arkwright's voice which Billy's keen\near was quick to detect. “She was nineteen then and very pretty.”\n\n“About my height, and with light-brown hair and big blue-gray eyes that\nlook steely cold when she's angry?” questioned Billy.\n\n“I reckon that's about it,” acknowledged the man, with a faint smile.\n\n“Then they _are_ the ones,” declared the girl, plainly excited. “Isn't\nthat splendid? Now we can know them, and perhaps do something for\nthem. I love that dear little mother already, and I think I should the\ndaughter--if she didn't put out so many prickers that I couldn't get\nnear her! But tell us about them. How did they come here? Why didn't you\nknow they were here?”\n\n“Are you good at answering a dozen questions at once?” asked Aunt\nHannah, turning smiling eyes from Billy to the man at her side.\n\n“Well, I can try,” he offered. “To begin with, they are Judge Greggory's\nwidow and daughter. They belong to fine families on both sides, and they\nused to be well off--really wealthy, for a small town. But the judge was\nbetter at money-making than he was at money-keeping, and when he came to\ndie his income stopped, of course, and his estate was found to be in bad\nshape through reckless loans and worthless investments. That was eight\nyears ago. Things went from bad to worse then, until there was almost\nnothing left.”\n\n“I knew there was some such story as that back of them,” declared Billy.\n“But how do you suppose they came here?”\n\n“To get away from--everybody, I suspect,” replied Arkwright. “That would\nbe like them. They were very proud; and it isn't easy, you know, to be\nnobody where you've been somebody. It doesn't hurt quite so hard--to be\nnobody where you've never been anything but nobody.”\n\n“I suppose so,” sighed Billy. “Still--they must have had friends.”\n\n“They did, of course; but when the love of one's friends becomes _too_\nhighly seasoned with pity, it doesn't make a pleasant morsel to swallow,\nspecially if you don't like the taste of the pity--and there are people\nwho don't, you know. The Greggorys were that kind. They were morbidly\nso. From their cheap little cottage, where they did their own work, they\nstepped out in their shabby garments and old-fashioned hats with heads\neven more proudly erect than in the old days when their home and their\ngowns and their doings were the admiration and envy of the town. You\nsee, they didn't want--that pity.”\n\n“I _do_ see,” cried Billy, her face aglow with sudden understanding;\n“and I don't believe pity would be--nice!” Her own chin was held high as\nshe spoke.\n\n“It must have been hard, indeed,” murmured Aunt Hannah with a sigh, as\nshe set down her teacup.\n\n“It was,” nodded Arkwright. “Of course Mrs. Greggory, with her crippled\nfoot, could do nothing to bring in any money except to sew a little. It\nall depended on Alice; and when matters got to their worst she began\nto teach. She was fond of music, and could play the piano well; and of\ncourse she had had the best instruction she could get from city teachers\nonly twenty miles away from our home town. Young as she was--about\nseventeen when she began to teach, I think--she got a few beginners\nright away, and in two years she had worked up quite a class, meanwhile\nkeeping on with her own studies, herself.\n\n“They might have carried the thing through, maybe,” continued Arkwright,\n“and never _apparently_ known that the 'pity' existed, if it hadn't been\nfor some ugly rumors that suddenly arose attacking the Judge's honesty\nin an old matter that somebody raked up. That was too much. Under this\nlast straw their courage broke utterly. Alice dismissed every pupil,\nsold almost all their remaining goods--they had lots of quite valuable\nheirlooms; I suspect that's where your Lowestoft teapot came in--and\nwith the money thus gained they left town. Until they could go, they\nscarcely showed themselves once on the street, they were never at home\nto callers, and they left without telling one soul where they were\ngoing, so far as we could ever learn.”\n\n“Why, the poor dears!” cried Billy. “How they must have suffered! But\nthings will be different now. You'll go to see them, of course, and--”\n At the look that came into Arkwright's face, she stopped in surprise.\n\n“You forget; they wouldn't wish to see me,” demurred the man. And again\nBilly noticed the odd constraint in his voice.\n\n“But they wouldn't mind _you--here_,” argued Billy.\n\n“I'm afraid they would. In fact, I'm sure they'd refuse entirely to see\nme.”\n\nBilly's eyes grew determined.\n\n“But they can't refuse--if I bring about a meeting just casually, you\nknow,” she challenged.\n\nArkwright laughed.\n\n“Well, I won't pretend to say as to the consequences of that,” he\nrejoined, rising to his feet; “but they might be disastrous. Wasn't it\nyou yourself who were telling me a few minutes ago how steely cold Miss\nAlice's eyes got when she was angry?”\n\nBilly knew by the way the man spoke that, for some reason, he did not\nwish to prolong the subject of his meeting the Greggorys. She made a\nquick shift, therefore, to another phase of the matter.\n\n“But tell me, please, before you go, how did those rumors come\nout--about Judge Greggory's honesty, I mean?”\n\n“Why, I never knew, exactly,” frowned Arkwright, musingly. “Yet it\nseems, too, that mother did say in one letter, while I was in Paris,\nthat some of the accusations had been found to be false, and that there\nwas a prospect that the Judge's good name might be saved, after all.”\n\n“Oh, I wish it might,” sighed Billy. “Think what it would mean to those\nwomen!”\n\n“'Twould mean everything,” cried Arkwright, warmly; “and I'll write\nto mother to-night, I will, and find out just what there is to it-if\nanything. Then you can tell them,” he finished a little stiffly.\n\n“Yes--or you,” nodded Billy, lightly. And because she began at once to\nspeak of something else, the first part of her sentence passed without\ncomment.\n\nThe door had scarcely closed behind Arkwright when Billy turned to Aunt\nHannah a beaming face.\n\n“Aunt Hannah, did you notice?” she cried, “how Mary Jane looked and\nacted whenever Alice Greggory was spoken of? There was something between\nthem--I'm sure there was; and they quarrelled, probably.”\n\n“Why, no, dear; I didn't see anything unusual,” murmured the elder lady.\n\n“Well, I did. And I'm going to be the fairy godmother that straightens\neverything all out, too. See if I'm not! They'd make a splendid couple,\nAunt Hannah. I'm going right down there to-morrow.”\n\n“Billy, my dear!” exclaimed the more conservative old lady, “aren't\nyou taking things a little too much for granted? Maybe they don't wish\nfor--for a fairy godmother!”\n\n“Oh, _they_ won't know I'm a fairy godmother--not one of them; and of\ncourse I wouldn't mention even a hint to anybody,” laughed Billy. “I'm\njust going down to get acquainted with the Greggorys; that's all. Only\nthink, Aunt Hannah, what they must have suffered! And look at the place\nthey're living in now--gentlewomen like them!”\n\n“Yes, yes, poor things, poor things!” sighed Aunt Hannah.\n\n“I hope I'll find out that she's really good--at teaching, I mean--the\ndaughter,” resumed Billy, after a moment's pause. “If she is, there's\none thing I can do to help, anyhow. I can get some of Marie's old pupils\nfor her. I _know_ some of them haven't begun with a new teacher, yet;\nand Mrs. Carleton told me last Friday that neither she nor her sister\nwas at all satisfied with the one their girls _have_ taken. They'd\nchange, I know, in a minute, at my recommendation--that is, of course,\nif I can _give_ the recommendation,” continued Billy, with a troubled\nfrown. “Anyhow, I'm going down to begin operations to-morrow.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. A MATTER OF STRAIGHT BUSINESS\n\n\nTrue to her assertion, Billy went down to the Greggorys' the next day.\nThis time she did not take Rosa with her. Even Aunt Hannah conceded that\nit would not be necessary. She had not been gone ten minutes, however,\nwhen the telephone bell rang, and Rosa came to say that Mr. Bertram\nHenshaw wanted to speak with Mrs. Stetson.\n\n“Rosa says that Billy's not there,” called Bertram's aggrieved voice,\nwhen Aunt Hannah had said, “Good morning, my boy.”\n\n“Dear me, no, Bertram. She's in a fever of excitement this morning.\nShe'll probably tell you all about it when you come out here to-night.\nYou _are_ coming out to-night, aren't you?”\n\n“Yes; oh, yes! But what is it? Where's she gone?”\n\nAunt Hannah laughed softly.\n\n“Well, she's gone down to the Greggorys'.”\n\n“The Greggorys'! What--again?”\n\n“Oh, you might as well get used to it, Bertram,” bantered Aunt Hannah,\n“for there'll be a good many 'agains,' I fancy.”\n\n“Why, Aunt Hannah, what do you mean?” Bertram's voice was not quite\npleased.\n\n“Oh, she'll tell you. It's only that the Greggorys have turned out to be\nold friends of Mr. Arkwright's.”\n\n“_Friends_ of Arkwright's!” Bertram's voice was decidedly displeased\nnow.\n\n“Yes; and there's quite a story to it all, as well. Billy is wildly\nexcited, as you'd know she would be. You'll hear all about it to-night,\nof course.”\n\n“Yes, of course,” echoed Bertram. But there was no ring of enthusiasm in\nhis voice, neither then, nor when he said good-by a moment later.\n\nBilly, meanwhile, on her way to the Greggory home, was, as Aunt Hannah\nhad said, “wildly excited.” It seemed so strange and wonderful and\ndelightful--the whole affair: that she should have found them because\nof a Lowestoft teapot, that Arkwright should know them, and that there\nshould be the chance now that she might help them--in some way; though\nthis last, she knew, could be accomplished only through the exercise of\nthe greatest tact and delicacy. She had not forgotten that Arkwright had\ntold her of their hatred of pity.\n\nIn the sober second thought of the morning, Billy was not sure now of a\npossible romance in connection with Arkwright and the daughter, Alice;\nbut she had by no means abandoned the idea, and she meant to keep\nher eyes open--and if there should be a chance to bring such a thing\nabout--! Meanwhile, of course, she should not mention the matter, even\nto Bertram.\n\nJust what would be her method of procedure this first morning, Billy had\nnot determined. The pretty potted azalea in her hand would be excuse for\nher entrance into the room. After that, circumstances must decide for\nthemselves.\n\nMrs. Greggory was found to be alone at home as before, and Billy was\nglad. She would rather begin with one than two, she thought. The little\nwoman greeted her cordially, gave misty-eyed thanks for the beautiful\nplant, and also for Billy's kind thoughtfulness Friday afternoon. From\nthat she was very skilfully led to talk more of the daughter; and\nsoon Billy was getting just the information she wanted--information\nconcerning the character, aims, and daily life of Alice Greggory.\n\n“You see, we have some money--a very little,” explained Mrs.\nGreggory, after a time; “though to get it we have had to sell all our\ntreasures--but the Lowestoft,” with a quick glance into Billy's\neyes. “We need not, perhaps, live in quite so poor a place; but we\nprefer--just now--to spend the little money we have for something\nother than imitation comfort--lessons, for instance, and an occasional\nconcert. My daughter is studying even while she is teaching. She hopes\nto train herself for an accompanist, and for a teacher. She does not\naspire to concert solo work. She understands her limitations.”\n\n“But she is probably--very good--at teaching.” Billy hesitated a little.\n\n“She is; very good. She has the best of recommendations.” A little\nproudly Mrs. Greggory gave the names of two Boston pianists--names that\nwould carry weight anywhere.\n\nUnconsciously Billy relaxed. She did not know until that moment how\nshe had worried for fear she could not, conscientiously, recommend this\nAlice Greggory.\n\n“Of course,” resumed the mother, “Alice's pupils are few, and they pay\nlow prices; but she is gaining. She goes to the houses, of course. She\nherself practises two hours a day at a house up on Pinckney Street. She\ngives lessons to a little girl in return.”\n\n“I see,” nodded Billy, brightly; “and I've been thinking, Mrs.\nGreggory--maybe I know of some pupils she could get. I have a friend who\nhas just given hers up, owing to her marriage. Sometime, soon, I'm going\nto talk to your daughter, if I may, and--”\n\n“And here she is right now,” interposed Mrs. Greggory, as the door\nopened under a hurried hand.\n\nBilly flushed and bit her lip. She was disturbed and disappointed. She\ndid not particularly wish to see Alice Greggory just then. She wished\neven less to see her when she noted the swift change that came to the\ngirl's face at sight of herself.\n\n“Oh! Why-good morning, Miss Neilson,” murmured Miss Greggory with a\nsmile so forced that her mother hurriedly looked to the azalea in search\nof a possible peacemaker.\n\n“My dear, see,” she stammered, “what Miss Neilson has brought me. And\nit's so full of blossoms, too! And she says it'll remain so for a long,\nlong time--if we'll only keep it wet.”\n\nAlice Greggory murmured a low something--a something that she tried,\nevidently, very hard to make politely appropriate and appreciative. Yet\nher manner, as she took off her hat and coat and sat down, so plainly\nsaid: “You are very kind, of course, but I wish you would keep yourself\nand your plants at home!” that Mrs. Greggory began a hurried apology,\nmuch as if the words had indeed been spoken.\n\n“My daughter is really ill this morning. You mustn't mind--that is, I'm\nafraid you'll think--you see, she took cold last week; a bad cold--and\nshe isn't over it, yet,” finished the little woman in painful\nembarrassment.\n\n“Of course she took cold--standing all those hours in that horrid wind,\nFriday!” cried Billy, indignantly.\n\nA quick red flew to Alice Greggory's face. Billy saw it at once and\nfervently wished she had spoken of anything but that Friday afternoon.\nIt looked almost as if she were _reminding_ them of what she had\ndone that day. In her confusion, and in her anxiety to say\nsomething--anything that would get their minds off that idea--she\nuttered now the first words that came into her head. As it happened,\nthey were the last words that sober second thought would have told her\nto say.\n\n“Never mind, Mrs. Greggory. We'll have her all well and strong soon;\nnever fear! Just wait till I send Peggy and Mary Jane to take her out\nfor a drive one of these mild, sunny days. You have no idea how much\ngood it will do her!”\n\nAlice Greggory got suddenly to her feet. Her face was very white now.\nHer eyes had the steely coldness that Billy knew so well. Her voice,\nwhen she spoke, was low and sternly controlled.\n\n“Miss Neilson, you will think me rude, of course, especially after your\ngreat kindness to me the other day; but I can't help it. It seems to me\nbest to speak now before it goes any further.”\n\n“Alice, dear,” remonstrated Mrs. Greggory, extending a frightened hand.\n\nThe girl did not turn her head nor hesitate; but she caught the extended\nhand and held it warmly in both her own, with gentle little pats, while\nshe went on speaking.\n\n“I'm sure mother agrees with me that it is best, for the present, that\nwe keep quite to ourselves. I cannot question your kindness, of course,\nafter your somewhat unusual favor the other day; but I am very sure that\nyour friends, Miss Peggy, and Miss Mary Jane, have no real desire\nto make my acquaintance, nor--if you'll pardon me--have I, under the\ncircumstances, any wish to make theirs.”\n\n“Oh, Alice, Alice,” began the little mother, in dismay; but a rippling\nlaugh from their visitor brought an angry flush even to her gentle face.\n\nBilly understood the flush, and struggled for self-control.\n\n“Please--please, forgive me!” she choked. “But you see--you couldn't, of\ncourse, know that Mary Jane and Peggy aren't _girls_. They're just a man\nand an automobile!”\n\nAn unwilling smile trembled on Alice Greggory's lips; but she still\nstood her ground.\n\n“After all, girls, or men and automobiles, Miss Neilson--it makes little\ndifference. They're--charity. And it's not so long that we've been\nobjects of charity that we quite really enjoy it--yet.”\n\nThere was a moment's hush. Billy's eyes had filled with tears.\n\n“I never even _thought_--charity,” said Billy, so gently that a faint\nred stole into the white cheeks opposite.\n\nFor a tense minute Alice Greggory held herself erect; then, with a\ncomplete change of manner and voice, she released her mother's hand,\ndropped into her own chair again, and said wearily:\n\n“I know you didn't, Miss Neilson. It's all my foolish pride, of course.\nIt's only that I was thinking how dearly I would love to meet girls\nagain--just as _girls!_ But--I no longer have any business with pride,\nof course. I shall be pleased, I'm sure,” she went on dully, “to accept\nanything you may do for us, from automobile rides to--to red flannel\npetticoats.”\n\nBilly almost--but not quite--laughed. Still, the laugh would have been\nnear to a sob, had it been given. Surprising as was the quick transition\nin the girl's manner, and absurd as was the juxtaposition of automobiles\nand red flannel petticoats, the white misery of Alice Greggory's face\nand the weary despair of her attitude were tragic--specially to one who\nknew her story as did Billy Neilson. And it was because Billy did\nknow her story that she did not make the mistake now of offering pity.\nInstead, she said with a bright smile, and a casual manner that gave no\nhint of studied labor:\n\n“Well, as it happens, Miss Greggory, what I want to-day has nothing\nwhatever to do with automobiles or red flannel petticoats. It's a\nmatter of straight business.” (How Billy blessed the thought that had\nso suddenly come to her!) “Your mother tells me you play accompaniments.\nNow a girls' club, of which I am a member, is getting up an operetta for\ncharity, and we need an accompanist. There is no one in the club who\nis able, and at the same time willing, to spend the amount of time\nnecessary for practice and rehearsals. So we had decided to hire one\noutside, and I have been given the task of finding one. It has occurred\nto me that perhaps you would be willing to undertake it for us. Would\nyou?”\n\nBilly knew, at once, from the quick change in the other's face and\nmanner, that she had taken exactly the right course to relieve the\nstrain of the situation. Despair and lassitude fell away from Alice\nGreggory almost like a garment. Her countenance became alert and\ninterested.\n\n“Indeed I would! I should be glad to do it.”\n\n“Good! Then can you come out to my home sometime to-morrow, and go over\nthe music with me? Rehearsals will not begin until next week; but I can\ngive you the music, and tell you something of what we are planning to\ndo.”\n\n“Yes. I could come at ten in the morning for an hour, or at three in\nthe afternoon for two hours or more,” replied Miss Greggory, after a\nmoment's hesitation.\n\n“Suppose we call it in the afternoon, then,” smiled Billy, as she rose\nto her feet. “And now I must go--and here's my address,” she finished,\ntaking out her card and laying it on the table near her.\n\nFor reasons of her own Billy went away that morning without saying\nanything more about the proposed new pupils. New pupils were not\nautomobile rides nor petticoats, to be sure--but she did not care to\nrisk disturbing the present interested happiness of Alice Greggory's\nface by mentioning anything that might be construed as too officious an\nassistance.\n\nOn the whole, Billy felt well pleased with her morning's work. To Aunt\nHannah, upon her return, she expressed herself thus:\n\n“It's splendid--even better than I hoped. I shall have a chance\nto-morrow, of course, to see for myself just how well she plays, and all\nthat. I'm pretty sure, though, from what I hear, that that part will be\nall right. Then the operetta will give us a chance to see a good deal of\nher, and to bring about a natural meeting between her and Mary Jane. Oh,\nAunt Hannah, I couldn't have _planned_ it better--and there the whole\nthing just tumbled into my hands! I knew it had the minute I remembered\nabout the operetta. You know I'm chairman, and they left me to get the\naccompanist; and like a flash it came to me, when I was wondering _what_\nto say or do to get her out of that awful state she was in--'Ask her to\nbe your accompanist.' And I did. And I'm so glad I did! Oh, Aunt Hannah,\nit's coming out lovely!--I know it is.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. PLANS AND PLOTTINGS\n\n\nTo Billy, Alice Greggory's first visit to Hillside was in every way a\ndelight and a satisfaction. To Alice, it was even more than that.\nFor the first time in years she found herself welcomed into a home of\nwealth, culture, and refinement as an equal; and the frank cordiality\nand naturalness of her hostess's evident expectation of meeting a\ncongenial companion was like balm to a sensitive soul rendered morbid by\nlong years of superciliousness and snubbing.\n\nNo wonder that under the cheery friendliness of it all, Alice Greggory's\ncold reserve vanished, and that in its place came something very like\nher old ease and charm of manner. By the time Aunt Hannah--according to\nprevious agreement--came into the room, the two girls were laughing and\nchatting over the operetta as if they had known each other for years.\n\nMuch to Billy's delight, Alice Greggory, as a musician, proved to be\neminently satisfactory. She was quick at sight reading, and accurate.\nShe played easily, and with good expression. Particularly was she a\ngood accompanist, possessing to a marked degree that happy faculty of\n_accompanying_ a singer: which means that she neither led the way nor\nlagged behind, being always exactly in sympathetic step--than which\nnothing is more soul-satisfying to the singer.\n\nIt was after the music for the operetta had been well-practised and\ndiscussed that Alice Greggory chanced to see one of Billy's own songs\nlying near her. With a pleased smile she picked it up.\n\n“Oh, you know this, too!” she cried. “I played it for a lady only the\nother day. It's so pretty, I think--all of hers are, that I have seen.\nBilly Neilson is a girl, you know, they say, in spite of--” She stopped\nabruptly. Her eyes grew wide and questioning. “Miss Neilson--it can't\nbe--you don't mean--is your name--it _is--you!_” she finished joyously,\nas the telltale color dyed Billy's face. The next moment her own cheeks\nburned scarlet. “And to think of my letting _you_ stand in line for a\ntwenty-five-cent admission!” she scorned.\n\n“Nonsense!” laughed Billy. “It didn't hurt me any more than it did\nyou. Come!”--in looking about for a quick something to take her guest's\nattention, Billy's eyes fell on the manuscript copy of her new song,\nbearing Arkwright's name. Yielding to a daring impulse, she drew it\nhastily forward. “Here's a new one--a brand-new one, not even printed\nyet. Don't you think the words are pretty?” she asked.\n\nAs she had hoped, Alice Greggory's eyes, after they had glanced half-way\nthrough the first page, sought the name at the left side below the\ntitle.\n\n“'Words by M. J.--'”--there was a visible start, and a pause before the\n“'Arkwright'” was uttered in a slightly different tone.\n\nBilly noted both the start and the pause--and gloried in them.\n\n“Yes; the words are by M. J. Arkwright,” she said with smooth unconcern,\nbut with a covert glance at the other's face. “Ever hear of him?”\n\nAlice Greggory gave a short little laugh.\n\n“Probably not--this one. I used to know an M. J. Arkwright, long ago;\nbut he wasn't--a poet, so far as I know,” she finished, with a little\ncatch in her breath that made Billy long to take her into a warm\nembrace.\n\nAlice Greggory turned then to the music. She had much to say of\nthis--very much; but she had nothing more whatever to say of Mr. M. J.\nArkwright in spite of the tempting conversation bait that Billy dropped\nso freely. After that, Rosa brought in tea and toast, and the little\nfrosted cakes that were always such a favorite with Billy's guests. Then\nAlice Greggory said good-by--her eyes full of tears that Billy pretended\nnot to see.\n\n“There!” breathed Billy, as soon as she had Aunt Hannah to herself\nagain. “What did I tell you? Did you see Miss Greggory's start and blush\nand hear her sigh just over the _name_ of M. J. Arkwright? Just as if--!\nNow I want them to meet; only it must be casual, Aunt Hannah--casual!\nAnd I'd rather wait till Mary Jane hears from his mother, if possible,\nso if there _is_ anything good to tell the poor girl, he can tell it.”\n\n“Yes, of course. Dear child!--I hope he can,” murmured Aunt Hannah.\n(Aunt Hannah had ceased now trying to make Billy refrain from the\nreprehensible “Mary Jane.” In fact, if the truth were known, Aunt Hannah\nherself in her thoughts--and sometimes in her words--called him “Mary\nJane.”) “But, indeed, my dear, I didn't see anything stiff, or--or\nrepelling about Miss Greggory, as you said there was.”\n\n“There wasn't--to-day,” smiled Billy. “Honestly, Aunt Hannah, I should\nnever have known her for the same girl--who showed me the door that\nfirst morning,” she finished merrily, as she turned to go up-stairs.\n\nIt was the next day that Cyril and Marie came home from their honeymoon.\nThey went directly to their pretty little apartment on Beacon Street,\nBrookline, within easy walking distance of Billy's own cozy home.\n\nCyril intended to build in a year or two. Meanwhile they had a very\npretty, convenient home which was, according to Bertram, “electrified\nto within an inch of its life, and equipped with everything that\nwas fireless, smokeless, dustless, and laborless.” In it Marie had a\nspotlessly white kitchen where she might make puddings to her heart's\ncontent.\n\nMarie had--again according to Bertram--“a visiting acquaintance with a\nmaid.” In other words, a stout woman was engaged to come two days in the\nweek to wash, iron, and scrub; also to come in each night to wash the\ndinner dishes, thus leaving Marie's evenings free--“for the shaded\nlamp,” Billy said.\n\nMarie had not arrived at this--to her, delightful--arrangement of a\n“visiting acquaintance” without some opposition from her friends. Even\nBilly had stood somewhat aghast.\n\n“But, my dear, won't it be hard for you, to do so much?” she argued one\nday. “You know you aren't very strong.”\n\n“I know; but it won't be hard, as I've planned it,” replied Marie,\n“specially when I've been longing for years to do this very thing. Why,\nBilly, if I had to stand by and watch a maid do all these things I\nwant to do myself, I should feel just like--like a hungry man who sees\nanother man eating up his dinner! Oh, of course,” she added plaintively,\nafter Billy's laughter had subsided, “I sha'n't do it always. I don't\nexpect to. Of course, when we have a house--I'm not sure, then, though,\nthat I sha'n't dress up the maid and order her to receive the calls and\ngo to the pink teas, while I make her puddings,” she finished saucily,\nas Billy began to laugh again.\n\nThe bride and groom, as was proper, were, soon after their arrival,\ninvited to dine at both William's and Billy's. Then, until Marie's “At\nHomes” should begin, the devoted couple settled down to quiet days\nby themselves, with only occasional visits from the family to\ninterrupt--“interrupt” was Bertram's word, not Marie's. Though it is\nsafe to say it was not far different from the one Cyril used--in his\nthoughts.\n\nBertram himself, these days, was more than busy. Besides working on\nMiss Winthrop's portrait, and on two or three other commissions, he was\nputting the finishing touches to four pictures which he was to show in\nthe exhibition soon to be held by a prominent Art Club of which he was\nthe acknowledged “star” member. Naturally, therefore, his time was\nwell occupied. Naturally, too, Billy, knowing this, lashed herself more\nsternly than ever into a daily reminder of Kate's assertion that he\nbelonged first to his Art.\n\nIn pursuance of this idea, Billy was careful to see that no engagement\nwith herself should in any way interfere with the artist's work, and\nthat no word of hers should attempt to keep him at her side when ART\ncalled. (Billy always spelled that word now in her mind with tall, black\nletters--the way it had sounded when it fell from Kate's lips.) That\nthese tactics on her part were beginning to fill her lover with vague\nalarm and a very definite unrest, she did not once suspect. Eagerly,\ntherefore,--even with conscientious delight--she welcomed the new\nsong-words that Arkwright brought--they would give her something else\nto take up her time and attention. She welcomed them, also, for another\nreason: they would bring Arkwright more often to the house, and this\nwould, of course, lead to that “casual meeting” between him and Alice\nGreggory when the rehearsals for the operetta should commence--which\nwould be very soon now. And Billy did so long to bring about that\nmeeting!\n\nTo Billy, all this was but “occupying her mind,” and playing Cupid's\nassistant to a worthy young couple torn cruelly apart by an unfeeling\nfate. To Bertram--to Bertram it was terror, and woe, and all manner of\ntorture; for in it Bertram saw only a growing fondness on the part\nof Billy for Arkwright, Arkwright's music, Arkwright's words, and\nArkwright's friends.\n\nThe first rehearsal for the operetta came on Wednesday evening. There\nwould be another on Thursday afternoon. Billy had told Alice Greggory to\narrange her pupils so that she could stay Wednesday night at Hillside,\nif the crippled mother could get along alone--and she could, Alice\nhad said. Thursday forenoon, therefore, Alice Greggory would, in all\nprobability, be at Hillside, specially as there would doubtless be an\nappointment or two for private rehearsal with some nervous soloist whose\npart was not progressing well. Such being the case, Billy had a plan\nshe meant to carry out. She was highly pleased, therefore, when Thursday\nmorning came, and everything, apparently, was working exactly to her\nmind.\n\nAlice was there. She had an appointment at quarter of eleven with\nthe leading tenor, and another later with the alto. After breakfast,\ntherefore, Billy said decisively:\n\n“Now, if you please, Miss Greggory, I'm going to put you up-stairs on\nthe couch in the sewing-room for a nap.”\n\n“But I've just got up,” remonstrated Miss Greggory.\n\n“I know you have,” smiled Billy; “but you were very late to bed last\nnight, and you've got a hard day before you. I insist upon your resting.\nYou will be absolutely undisturbed there, and you must shut the door\nand not come down-stairs till I send for you. Mr. Johnson isn't due till\nquarter of eleven, is he?”\n\n“N-no.”\n\n“Then come with me,” directed Billy, leading the way up-stairs. “There,\nnow, don't come down till I call you,” she went on, when they had\nreached the little room at the end of the hall. “I'm going to leave Aunt\nHannah's door open, so you'll have good air--she isn't in there. She's\nwriting letters in my room, Now here's a book, and you _may_ read, but\nI should prefer you to sleep,” she nodded brightly as she went out and\nshut the door quietly. Then, like the guilty conspirator she was, she\nwent down-stairs to wait for Arkwright.\n\nIt was a fine plan. Arkwright was due at ten o'clock--Billy had\nspecially asked him to come at that hour. He would not know, of course,\nthat Alice Greggory was in the house; but soon after his arrival Billy\nmeant to excuse herself for a moment, slip up-stairs and send Alice\nGreggory down for a book, a pair of scissors, a shawl for Aunt\nHannah--anything would do for a pretext, anything so that the girl might\nwalk into the living-room and find Arkwright waiting for her alone.\nAnd then--What happened next was, in Billy's mind, very vague, but very\nattractive as a nucleus for one's thoughts, nevertheless.\n\nAll this was, indeed, a fine plan; but--(If only fine plans would not so\noften have a “but”!) In Billy's case the “but” had to do with things\nso apparently unrelated as were Aunt Hannah's clock and a negro's coal\nwagon. The clock struck eleven at half-past ten, and the wagon dumped\nitself to destruction directly in front of a trolley car in which sat\nMr. M. J. Arkwright, hurrying to keep his appointment with Miss Billy\nNeilson. It was almost half-past ten when Arkwright finally rang the\nbell at Hillside. Billy greeted him so eagerly, and at the same time\nwith such evident disappointment at his late arrival, that Arkwright's\nheart sang with joy.\n\n“But there's a rehearsal at quarter of eleven,” exclaimed Billy, in\nanswer to his hurried explanation of the delay; “and this gives so\nlittle time for--for--so little time, you know,” she finished in\nconfusion, casting frantically about in her mind for an excuse to hurry\nup-stairs and send Alice Greggory down before it should be quite too\nlate.\n\nNo wonder that Arkwright, noting the sparkle in her eye, the agitation\nin her manner, and the embarrassed red in her cheek, took new courage.\nFor so long had this girl held him at the end of a major third or a\ndiminished seventh; for so long had she blithely accepted his every word\nand act as devotion to music, not herself--for so long had she done all\nthis that he had come to fear that never would she do anything else. No\nwonder then, that now, in the soft radiance of the strange, new light on\nher face, his own face glowed ardently, and that he leaned forward with\nan impetuous rush of eager words.\n\n“But there is time, Miss Billy--if you'd give me leave--to say--”\n\n“I'm afraid I kept you waiting,” interrupted the hurried voice of Alice\nGreggory from the hall doorway. “I was asleep, I think, when a clock\nsomewhere, striking eleven--Why, Mr.--Arkwright!”\n\nNot until Alice Greggory had nearly crossed the room did she see that\nthe man standing by her hostess was--not the tenor she had expected\nto find--but an old acquaintance. Then it was that the tremulous\n“Mr.-Arkwright!” fell from her lips.\n\nBilly and Arkwright had turned at her first words. At her last,\nArkwright, with a half-despairing, half-reproachful glance at Billy,\nstepped forward.\n\n“Miss Greggory!--you _are_ Miss Alice Greggory, I am sure,” he said\npleasantly.\n\nAt the first opportunity Billy murmured a hasty excuse and left the\nroom. To Aunt Hannah she flew with a woebegone face.\n\n“Oh, Aunt Hannah, Aunt Hannah,” she wailed, half laughing, half crying;\n“that wretched little fib-teller of a clock of yours spoiled it all!”\n\n“Spoiled it! Spoiled what, child?”\n\n“My first meeting between Mary Jane and Miss Greggory. I had it all\narranged that they were to have it _alone_; but that miserable little\nfibber up-stairs struck eleven at half-past ten, and Miss Greggory heard\nit and thought she was fifteen minutes late. So down she hurried, half\nawake, and spoiled all my plans. Now she's sitting in there with him, in\nchairs the length of the room apart, discussing the snowstorm last night\nor the moonrise this morning--or some other such silly thing. And I had\nit so beautifully planned!”\n\n“Well, well, dear, I'm sorry, I'm sure,” smiled Aunt Hannah; “but I\ncan't think any real harm is done. Did Mary Jane have anything to tell\nher--about her father, I mean?”\n\nOnly the faintest flicker of Billy's eyelid testified that the everyday\naccustomedness of that “Mary Jane” on Aunt Hannah's lips had not escaped\nher.\n\n“No, nothing definite. Yet there was a little. Friends are still trying\nto clear his name, and I believe are meeting with increasing success.\nI don't know, of course, whether he'll say anything about it\nto-day--_now_. To think I had to be right round under foot like that\nwhen they met!” went on Billy, indignantly. “I shouldn't have been, in a\nminute more, though. I was just trying to think up an excuse to come\nup and send down Miss Greggory, when Mary Jane began to tell me\nsomething--I haven't the faintest idea what--then _she_ appeared, and it\nwas all over. And there's the doorbell, and the tenor, I suppose; so of\ncourse it's all over now,” she sighed, rising to go down-stairs.\n\nAs it chanced, however, it was not the tenor, but a message from him--a\nmessage that brought dire consternation to the Chairman of the Committee\nof Arrangements. The tenor had thrown up his part. He could not take it;\nit was too difficult. He felt that this should be told--at once rather\nthan to worry along for another week or two, and then give up. So he had\ntold it.\n\n“But what shall we do, Miss Greggory?” appealed Billy. “It _is_ a hard\npart, you know; but if Mr. Tobey can't take it, I don't know who can. We\ndon't want to hire a singer for it, if we can help it. The profits\nare to go to the Home for Crippled Children, you know,” she explained,\nturning to Arkwright, “and we decided to hire only the accompanist.”\n\nAn odd expression flitted across Miss Greggory's face.\n\n“Mr. Arkwright used to sing--tenor,” she observed quietly.\n\n“As if he didn't now--a perfectly glorious tenor,” retorted Billy. “But\nas if _he_ would take _this!_”\n\nFor only a brief moment did Arkwright hesitate; then blandly he\nsuggested:\n\n“Suppose you try him, and see.”\n\nBilly sat suddenly erect.\n\n“Would you, really? _Could_ you--take the time, and all?” she cried.\n\n“Yes, I think I would--under the circumstances,” he smiled. “I think\nI could, too, though I might not be able to attend all the rehearsals.\nStill, if I find I have to ask permission, I'll endeavor to convince\nthe powers-that-be that singing in this operetta will be just the\nstepping-stone I need to success in Grand Opera.”\n\n“Oh, if you only would take it,” breathed Billy, “we'd be so glad!”\n\n“Well,” said Arkwright, his eyes on Billy's frankly delighted face, “as\nI said before--under the circumstances I think I would.”\n\n“Thank you! Then it's all beautifully settled,” rejoiced Billy, with a\nhappy sigh; and unconsciously she gave Alice Greggory's hand near her a\nlittle pat.\n\nIn Billy's mind the “circumstances” of Arkwright's acceptance of the\npart were Alice Greggory and her position as accompanist, of course.\nBilly would have been surprised indeed--and dismayed--had she known that\nin Arkwright's mind the “circumstances” were herself, and the fact that\nshe, too, had a part in the operetta, necessitating her presence at\nrehearsals, and hinting at a delightful comradeship impossible, perhaps,\notherwise.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. THE CAUSE AND BERTRAM\n\n\nFebruary came The operetta, for which Billy was working so hard, was\nto be given the twentieth. The Art Exhibition, for which Bertram was\npreparing his four pictures, was to open the sixteenth, with a private\nview for specially invited friends the evening before.\n\nOn the eleventh day of February Mrs. Greggory and her daughter arrived\nat Hillside for a ten-days' visit. Not until after a great deal of\npleading and argument, however, had Billy been able to bring this about.\n\n“But, my dears, both of you,” Billy had at last said to them; “just\nlisten. We shall have numberless rehearsals during those last ten\ndays before the thing comes off. They will be at all hours, and of all\nlengths. You, Miss Greggory, will have to be on hand for them all, of\ncourse, and will have to stay all night several times, probably. You,\nMrs. Greggory, ought not to be alone down here. There is no sensible,\nvalid reason why you should not both come out to the house for those ten\ndays; and I shall feel seriously hurt and offended if you do not consent\nto do it.”\n\n“But--my pupils,” Alice Greggory had demurred.\n\n“You can go in town from my home at any time to give your lessons, and\na little shifting about and arranging for those ten days will enable you\nto set the hours conveniently one after another, I am sure, so you can\nattend to several on one trip. Meanwhile your mother will be having a\nlovely time teaching Aunt Hannah how to knit a new shawl; so you won't\nhave to be worrying about her.”\n\nAfter all, it had been the great good and pleasure which the visit would\nbring to Mrs. Greggory that had been the final straw to tip the scales.\nOn the eleventh of February, therefore, in the company of the once\nscorned “Peggy and Mary Jane,” Alice Greggory and her mother had arrived\nat Hillside.\n\nEver since the first meeting of Alice Greggory and Arkwright, Billy had\nbeen sorely troubled by the conduct of the two young people. She had,\nas she mournfully told herself, been able to make nothing of it. The two\nwere civility itself to each other, but very plainly they were not at\nease in each other's company; and Billy, much to her surprise, had to\nadmit that Arkwright did not appear to appreciate the “circumstances”\n now that he had them. The pair called each other, ceremoniously, “Mr.\nArkwright,” and “Miss Greggory”--but then, that, of course, did not\n“signify,” Billy declared to herself.\n\n“I suppose you don't ever call him 'Mary Jane,'” she said to the girl, a\nlittle mischievously, one day.\n\n“'Mary Jane'? Mr. Arkwright? No, I don't,” rejoined Miss Greggory, with\nan odd smile. Then, after a moment, she added: “I believe his brothers\nand sisters used to, however.”\n\n“Yes, I know,” laughed Billy. “We thought he was a real Mary Jane,\nonce.” And she told the story of his arrival. “So you see,” she\nfinished, when Alice Greggory had done laughing over the tale, “he\nalways will be 'Mary Jane' to us. By the way, what is his name?”\n\nMiss Greggory looked up in surprise.\n\n“Why, it's--” She stopped short, her eyes questioning. “Why, hasn't he\never told you?” she queried.\n\nBilly lifted her chin.\n\n“No. He told us to guess it, and we have guessed everything we can think\nof, even up to 'Methuselah John'; but he says we haven't hit it yet.”\n\n“'Methuselah John,' indeed!” laughed the other, merrily.\n\n“Well, I'm sure that's a nice, solid name,” defended Billy, her chin\nstill at a challenging tilt. “If it isn't 'Methuselah John,' what is it,\nthen?”\n\nBut Alice Greggory shook her head. She, too, it seemed, could be firm,\non occasion. And though she smiled brightly, all she would say, was:\n\n“If he hasn't told you, I sha'n't. You'll have to go to him.”\n\n“Oh, well, I can still call him 'Mary Jane,'” retorted Billy, with airy\ndisdain.\n\nAll this, however, so far as Billy could see, was not in the least\nhelping along the cause that had become so dear to her--the reuniting of\na pair of lovers. It occurred to her then, one day, that perhaps, after\nall, they were not lovers, and did not wish to be reunited. At\nthis disquieting thought Billy decided, suddenly, to go almost to\nheadquarters. She would speak to Mrs. Greggory if ever the opportunity\noffered. Great was her joy, therefore, when, a day or two after the\nGreggorys arrived at the house, Mrs. Greggory's chance reference to\nArkwright and her daughter gave Billy the opportunity she sought.\n\n“They used to know each other long ago, Mr. Arkwright tells me,” Billy\nbegan warily.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nThe quietly polite monosyllable was not very encouraging, to be sure;\nbut Billy, secure in her conviction that her cause was a righteous one,\nrefused to be daunted.\n\n“I think it was so romantic--their running across each other like this,\nMrs. Greggory,” she murmured. “And there _was_ a romance, wasn't there?\nI have just felt in my bones that there was--a romance!”\n\nBilly held her breath. It was what she had meant to say, but now that\nshe had said it, the words seemed very fearsome indeed--to say to Mrs.\nGreggory. Then Billy remembered her Cause, and took heart--Billy was\nspelling it now with a capital C.\n\nFor a long minute Mrs. Greggory did not answer--for so long a minute\nthat Billy's breath dropped into a fluttering sigh, and her Cause became\nsuddenly “IMPERTINENCE” spelled in black capitals. Then Mrs. Greggory\nspoke slowly, a little sadly.\n\n“I don't mind saying to you that I did hope, once, that there would be a\nromance there. They were the best of friends, and they were well-suited\nto each other in tastes and temperament. I think, indeed, that the\nromance was well under way (though there was never an engagement)\nwhen--” Mrs. Greggory paused and wet her lips. Her voice, when she\nresumed, carried the stern note so familiar to Billy in her first\nacquaintance with this woman and her daughter. “As I presume\nMr. Arkwright has told you, we have met with many changes in our\nlife--changes which necessitated a new home and a new mode of\nliving. Naturally, under those circumstances, old friends--and old\nromances--must change, too.”\n\n“But, Mrs. Greggory,” stammered Billy, “I'm sure Mr. Arkwright would\nwant--” An up-lifted hand silenced her peremptorily.\n\n“Mr. Arkwright was very kind, and a gentleman, always,” interposed the\nlady, coldly; “but Judge Greggory's daughter would not allow herself\nto be placed where apologies for her father would be necessary--_ever!_\nThere, please, dear Miss Neilson, let us not talk of it any more,”\n begged Mrs. Greggory, brokenly.\n\n“No, indeed, of course not!” cried Billy; but her heart rejoiced.\n\nShe understood it all now. Arkwright and Alice Greggory had been almost\nlovers when the charges against the Judge's honor had plunged the family\ninto despairing humiliation. Then had come the time when, according\nto Arkwright's own story, the two women had shut themselves indoors,\nrefused to see their friends, and left town as soon as possible. Thus\nhad come the breaking of whatever tie there was between Alice Greggory\nand Arkwright. Not to have broken it would have meant, for Alice, the\nplacing of herself in a position where, sometime, apologies must be made\nfor her father. This was what Mrs. Greggory had meant--and again, as\nBilly thought of it, Billy's heart rejoiced.\n\nWas not her way clear now before her? Did she not have it in her power,\npossibly--even probably--to bring happiness where only sadness was\nbefore? As if it would not be a simple thing to rekindle the old\nflame--to make these two estranged hearts beat as one again!\n\nNot now was the Cause an IMPERTINENCE in tall black letters. It was,\ninstead, a shining beacon in letters of flame guiding straight to\nvictory.\n\nBilly went to sleep that night making plans for Alice Greggory and\nArkwright to be thrown together naturally--“just as a matter of course,\nyou know,” she said drowsily to herself, all in the dark.\n\nSome three or four miles away down Beacon Street at that moment Bertram\nHenshaw, in the Strata, was, as it happened, not falling asleep. He was\nlying broadly and unhappily awake Bertram very frequently lay broadly\nand unhappily awake these days--or rather nights. He told himself, on\nthese occasions, that it was perfectly natural--indeed it was!--that\nBilly should be with Arkwright and his friends, the Greggorys, so much.\nThere were the new songs, and the operetta with its rehearsals as a\ncause for it all. At the same time, deep within his fearful soul was the\nconsciousness that Arkwright, the Greggorys, and the operetta were but\nMusic--Music, the spectre that from the first had dogged his footsteps.\n\nWith Billy's behavior toward himself, Bertram could find no fault. She\nwas always her sweet, loyal, lovable self, eager to hear of his work,\nearnestly solicitous that it should be a success. She even--as he\nsometimes half-irritably remembered--had once told him that she realized\nhe belonged to Art before he did to himself; and when he had indignantly\ndenied this, she had only laughed and thrown a kiss at him, with the\nremark that he ought to hear his sister Kate's opinion of that matter.\nAs if he wanted Kate's opinion on that or anything else that concerned\nhim and Billy!\n\nOnce, torn by jealousy, and exasperated at the frequent interruptions of\ntheir quiet hours together, he had complained openly.\n\n“Actually, Billy, it's worse than Marie's wedding,” he declared, “_Then_\nit was tablecloths and napkins that could be dumped in a chair. _Now_\nit's a girl who wants to rehearse, or a woman that wants a different\nwig, or a telephone message that the sopranos have quarrelled again. I\nloathe that operetta!”\n\nBilly laughed, but she frowned, too.\n\n“I know, dear; I don't like that part. I wish they _would_ let me alone\nwhen I'm with you! But as for the operetta, it is really a good thing,\ndear, and you'll say so when you see it. It's going to be a great\nsuccess--I can say that because my part is only a small one, you know.\nWe shall make lots of money for the Home, too, I'm sure.”\n\n“But you're wearing yourself all out with it, dear,” scowled Bertram.\n\n“Nonsense! I like it; besides, when I'm doing this I'm not telephoning\nyou to come and amuse me. Just think what a lot of extra time you have\nfor your work!”\n\n“Don't want it,” avowed Bertram.\n\n“But the _work_ may,” retorted Billy, showing all her dimples. “Never\nmind, though; it'll all be over after the twentieth. _This_ isn't an\nunderstudy like Marie's wedding, you know,” she finished demurely.\n\n“Thank heaven for that!” Bertram had breathed fervently. But even as he\nsaid the words he grew sick with fear. What if, after all, this _were_\nan understudy to what was to come later when Music, his rival, had\nreally conquered?\n\nBertram knew that however secure might seem Billy's affection for\nhimself, there was still in his own mind a horrid fear lest underneath\nthat security were an unconscious, growing fondness for something he\ncould not give, for some one that he was not--a fondness that would one\nday cause Billy to awake. As Bertram, in his morbid fancy pictured it,\nhe realized only too well what that awakening would mean to himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. THE ARTIST AND HIS ART\n\n\nThe private view of the paintings and drawings of the Brush and Pencil\nClub on the evening of the fifteenth was a great success. Society sent\nits fairest women in frocks that were pictures in themselves. Art\nsent its severest critics and its most ardent devotees. The Press sent\nreporters that the World might know what Art and Society were doing, and\nhow they did it.\n\nBefore the canvases signed with Bertram Henshaw's name there was always\nto be found an admiring group representing both Art and Society with\nthe Press on the outskirts to report. William Henshaw, coming unobserved\nupon one such group, paused a moment to smile at the various more or\nless disconnected comments.\n\n“What a lovely blue!”\n\n“Marvellous color sense!”\n\n“Now those shadows are--”\n\n“He gets his high lights so--”\n\n“I declare, she looks just like Blanche Payton!”\n\n“Every line there is full of meaning.”\n\n“I suppose it's very fine, but--”\n\n“Now, I say, Henshaw is--”\n\n“Is this by the man that's painting Margy Winthrop's portrait?”\n\n“It's idealism, man, idealism!”\n\n“I'm going to have a dress just that shade of blue.”\n\n“Isn't that just too sweet!”\n\n“Now for realism, I consider Henshaw--”\n\n“There aren't many with his sensitive, brilliant touch.”\n\n“Oh, what a pretty picture!”\n\nWilliam moved on then.\n\nBilly was rapturously proud of Bertram that evening. He was, of course,\nthe centre of congratulations and hearty praise. At his side, Billy,\nwith sparkling eyes, welcomed each smiling congratulation and gloried in\nevery commendatory word she heard.\n\n“Oh, Bertram, isn't it splendid! I'm so proud of you,” she whispered\nsoftly, when a moment's lull gave her opportunity.\n\n“They're all words, words, idle words,” he laughed; but his eyes shone.\n\n“Just as if they weren't all true!” she bridled, turning to greet\nWilliam, who came up at that moment. “Isn't it fine, Uncle William?” she\nbeamed. “And aren't we proud of him?”\n\n“We are, indeed,” smiled the man. “But if you and Bertram want to get\nthe real opinion of this crowd, you should go and stand near one of his\npictures five minutes. As a sort of crazy--quilt criticism it can't be\nbeat.”\n\n“I know,” laughed Bertram. “I've done it, in days long gone.”\n\n“Bertram, not really?” cried Billy.\n\n“Sure! As if every young artist at the first didn't don goggles or a\nfalse mustache and study the pictures on either side of his own till he\ncould paint them with his eyes shut!”\n\n“And what did you hear?” demanded the girl.\n\n“What didn't I hear?” laughed her lover. “But I didn't do it but once\nor twice. I lost my head one day and began to argue the question of\nperspective with a couple of old codgers who were criticizing a bit of\nforeshortening that was my special pet. I forgot my goggles and sailed\nin. The game was up then, of course; and I never put them on again. But\nit was worth a farm to see their faces when I stood 'discovered' as the\nstage-folk say.”\n\n“Serves you right, sir--listening like that,” scolded Billy.\n\nBertram laughed and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“Well, it cured me, anyhow. I haven't done it since,” he declared.\n\nIt was some time later, on the way home, that Bertram said:\n\n“It was gratifying, of course, Billy, and I liked it. It would be absurd\nto say I didn't like the many pleasant words of apparently sincere\nappreciation I heard to-night. But I couldn't help thinking of the next\ntime--always the next time.”\n\n“The next time?” Billy's eyes were slightly puzzled.\n\n“That I exhibit, I mean. The Bohemian Ten hold their exhibition next\nmonth, you know. I shall show just one picture--the portrait of Miss\nWinthrop.”\n\n“Oh, Bertram!”\n\n“It'll be 'Oh, Bertram!' then, dear, if it isn't a success,” he sighed.\n“I don't believe you realize yet what that thing is going to mean for\nme.”\n\n“Well, I should think I might,” retorted Billy, a little tremulously,\n“after all I've heard about it. I should think _everybody_ knew you were\ndoing it, Bertram. Actually, I'm not sure Marie's scrub-lady won't ask\nme some day how Mr. Bertram's picture is coming on!”\n\n“That's the dickens of it, in a way,” sighed Bertram, with a faint\nsmile. “I am amazed--and a little frightened, I'll admit--at the\nuniversality of the interest. You see, the Winthrops have been pleased\nto spread it, for one reason or another, and of course many already know\nof the failures of Anderson and Fullam. That's why, if I should fail--”\n\n“But you aren't going to fail,” interposed the girl, resolutely.\n\n“No, I know I'm not. I only said 'if,'” fenced the man, his voice not\nquite steady.\n\n“There isn't going to be any 'if,'” settled Billy. “Now tell me, when is\nthe exhibition?”\n\n“March twentieth--the private view. Mr. Winthrop is not only willing,\nbut anxious, that I show it. I wasn't sure that he'd want me to--in\nan exhibition. But it seems he does. His daughter says he has every\nconfidence in the portrait and wants everybody to see it.”\n\n“That's where he shows his good sense,” declared Billy. Then, with\njust a touch of constraint, she asked: “And how is the new, latest pose\ncoming on?”\n\n“Very well, I think,” answered Bertram, a little hesitatingly. “We've\nhad so many, many interruptions, though, that it is surprising how slow\nit is moving. In the first place, Miss Winthrop is gone more than half\nthe time (she goes again to-morrow for a week!), and in this portrait\nI'm not painting a stroke without my model before me. I mean to take no\nchances, you see; and Miss Winthrop is perfectly willing to give me all\nthe sittings I wish for. Of course, if she hadn't changed the pose and\ncostume so many times, it would have been done long ago--and she knows\nit.”\n\n“Of course--she knows it,” murmured Billy, a little faintly, but with a\npeculiar intonation in her voice.\n\n“And so you see,” sighed Bertram, “what the twentieth of March is going\nto mean for me.”\n\n“It's going to mean a splendid triumph!” asserted Billy; and this time\nher voice was not faint, and it carried only a ring of loyal confidence.\n\n“You blessed comforter!” murmured Bertram, giving with his eyes the\ncaress that his lips would so much have preferred to give--under more\npropitious circumstances.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. THE OPERETTA\n\n\nThe sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth of February were, for Billy,\nand for all concerned in the success of the operetta, days of hurry,\nworry, and feverish excitement, as was to be expected, of course. Each\nafternoon and every evening saw rehearsals in whole, or in parts. A\nfriend of the Club-president's sister-in-law-a woman whose husband was\nstage manager of a Boston theatre--had consented to come and “coach”\n the performers. At her appearance the performers--promptly thrown into\nnervous spasms by this fearsome nearness to the “real thing”--forgot\nhalf their cues, and conducted themselves generally like frightened\nschool children on “piece day,” much to their own and every one else's\ndespair. Then, on the evening of the nineteenth, came the final dress\nrehearsal on the stage of the pretty little hall that had been engaged\nfor the performance of the operetta.\n\nThe dress rehearsal, like most of its kind, was, for every one, nothing\nbut a nightmare of discord, discouragement, and disaster. Everybody's\nnerves were on edge, everybody was sure the thing would be a “flat\nfailure.” The soprano sang off the key, the alto forgot to shriek\n“Beware, beware!” until it was so late there was nothing to beware of;\nthe basso stepped on Billy's trailing frock and tore it; even the tenor,\nArkwright himself, seemed to have lost every bit of vim from his acting.\nThe chorus sang “Oh, be joyful!” with dirge-like solemnity, and danced\nas if legs and feet were made of wood. The lovers, after the fashion of\namateur actors from time immemorial, “made love like sticks.”\n\nBilly, when the dismal thing had dragged its way through the final\nnote, sat “down front,” crying softly in the semi-darkness while she\nwas waiting for Alice Greggory to “run it through just once more” with a\npair of tired-faced, fluffy-skirted fairies who could _not_ learn that a\nduet meant a _duet_--not two solos, independently hurried or retarded as\none's fancy for the moment dictated.\n\nTo Billy, just then, life did not look to be even half worth the living.\nHer head ached, her throat was going-to-be-sore, her shoe hurt, and her\ndress--the trailing frock that had been under the basso's foot--could\nnot possibly be decently repaired before to-morrow night, she was sure.\n\nBad as these things were, however, they were only the intimate,\nimmediate woes. Beyond and around them lay others many others. To be\nsure, Bertram and happiness were supposed to be somewhere in the dim\nand uncertain future; but between her and them lay all these other woes,\nchief of which was the unutterable tragedy of to-morrow night.\n\nIt was to be a failure, of course. Billy had calmly made up her mind to\nthat, now. But then, she was used to failures, she told herself. Was she\nnot plainly failing every day of her life to bring about even friendship\nbetween Alice Greggory and Arkwright? Did they not emphatically and\nsystematically refuse to be “thrown together,” either naturally, or\nunnaturally? And yet--whenever again could she expect such opportunities\nto further her Cause as had been hers the past few weeks, through the\noperetta and its rehearsals? Certainly, never again! It had been a\nfailure like all the rest; like the operetta, in particular.\n\nBilly did not mean that any one should know she was crying. She supposed\nthat all the performers except herself and the two earth-bound fairies\nby the piano with Alice Greggory were gone. She knew that John with\nPeggy was probably waiting at the door outside, and she hoped that soon\nthe fairies would decide to go home and go to bed, and let other people\ndo the same. For her part, she did not see why they were struggling so\nhard, anyway. Why needn't they go ahead and sing their duet like two\nsolos if they wanted to? As if a little thing like that could make a\nfeather's weight of difference in the grand total of to-morrow night's\nwretchedness when the final curtain should have been rung down on their\nshame!\n\n“Miss Neilson, you aren't--crying!” exclaimed a low voice; and Billy\nturned to find Arkwright standing by her side in the dim light.\n\n“Oh, no--yes--well, maybe I was, a little,” stammered Billy, trying to\nspeak very unconcernedly. “How warm it is in here! Do you think it's\ngoing to rain?--that is, outdoors, of course, I mean.”\n\nArkwright dropped into the seat behind Billy and leaned forward, his\neyes striving to read the girl's half-averted face. If Billy had turned,\nshe would have seen that Arkwright's own face showed white and a little\ndrawn-looking in the feeble rays from the light by the piano. But\nBilly did not turn. She kept her eyes steadily averted; and she went on\nspeaking--airy, inconsequential words.\n\n“Dear me, if those girls _would_ only pull together! But then, what's\nthe difference? I supposed you had gone home long ago, Mr. Arkwright.”\n\n“Miss Neilson, you _are_ crying!” Arkwright's voice was low and\nvibrant. “As if anything or anybody in the world _could_ make _you_ cry!\nPlease--you have only to command me, and I will sally forth at once to\nslay the offender.” His words were light, but his voice still shook with\nemotion.\n\nBilly gave an hysterical little giggle. Angrily she brushed the\npersistent tears from her eyes.\n\n“All right, then; I'll dub you my Sir Knight,” she faltered. “But I'll\nwarn you--you'll have your hands full. You'll have to slay my headache,\nand my throat-ache, and my shoe that hurts, and the man who stepped on\nmy dress, and--and everybody in the operetta, including myself.”\n\n“Everybody--in the operetta!” Arkwright did look a little startled, at\nthis wholesale slaughter.\n\n“Yes. Did you ever see such an awful, awful thing as that was to-night?”\n moaned the girl.\n\nArkwright's face relaxed.\n\n“Oh, so _that's_ what it is!” he laughed lightly. “Then it's only a bogy\nof fear that I've got to slay, after all; and I'll despatch that right\nnow with a single blow. Dress rehearsals always go like that to-night.\nI've been in a dozen, and I never yet saw one go half decent. Don't you\nworry. The worse the rehearsal, the better the performance, every time!”\n\nBilly blinked off the tears and essayed a smile as she retorted:\n\n“Well, if that's so, then ours to-morrow night ought to be a--a--”\n\n“A corker,” helped out Arkwright, promptly; “and it will be, too. You\npoor child, you're worn out; and no wonder! But don't worry another\nbit about the operetta. Now is there anything else I can do for you?\nAnything else I can slay?”\n\nBilly laughed tremulously.\n\n“N-no, thank you; not that you can--slay, I fancy,” she sighed.\n“That is--not that you _will_,” she amended wistfully, with a sudden\nremembrance of the Cause, for which he might do so much--if he only\nwould.\n\nArkwright bent a little nearer. His breath stirred the loose, curling\nhair behind Billy's ear. His eyes had flashed into sudden fire.\n\n“But you don't know what I'd do if I could,” he murmured unsteadily. “If\nyou'd let me tell you--if you only knew the wish that has lain closest\nto my heart for--”\n\n“Miss Neilson, please,” called the despairing voice of one of the\nearth-bound fairies; “Miss Neilson, you _are_ there, aren't you?”\n\n“Yes, I'm right here,” answered Billy, wearily. Arkwright answered, too,\nbut not aloud--which was wise.\n\n“Oh dear! you're tired, I know,” wailed the fairy, “but if you would\nplease come and help us just a minute! Could you?”\n\n“Why, yes, of course.” Billy rose to her feet, still wearily.\n\nArkwright touched her arm. She turned and saw his face. It was very\nwhite--so white that her eyes widened in surprised questioning.\n\nAs if answering the unspoken words, the man shook his head.\n\n“I can't, now, of course,” he said. “But there _is_ something I want to\nsay--a story I want to tell you--after to-morrow, perhaps. May I?”\n\nTo Billy, the tremor of his voice, the suffering in his eyes, and the\n“story” he was begging to tell could have but one interpretation: Alice\nGreggory. Her face, therefore, was a glory of tender sympathy as she\nreached out her hand in farewell.\n\n“Of course you may,” she cried. “Come any time after to-morrow night,\nplease,” she smiled encouragingly, as she turned toward the stage.\n\nBehind her, Arkwright stumbled twice as he walked up the incline toward\nthe outer door--stumbled, not because of the semi-darkness of the little\ntheatre, but because of the blinding radiance of a girl's illumined face\nwhich he had, a moment before, read all unknowingly exactly wrong.\n\n\nA little more than twenty-four hours later, Billy Neilson, in her own\nroom, drew a long breath of relief. It was twelve o'clock on the night\nof the twentieth, and the operetta was over.\n\nTo Billy, life was eminently worth living to-night. Her head did not\nache, her throat was not sore, her shoe did not hurt, her dress had\nbeen mended so successfully by Aunt Hannah, and with such comforting\ncelerity, that long before night one would never have suspected the\nfilmy thing had known the devastating tread of any man's foot. Better\nyet, the soprano had sung exactly to key, the alto had shrieked\n“Beware!” to thrilling purpose, Arkwright had shown all his old charm\nand vim, and the chorus had been prodigies of joyousness and marvels\nof lightness. Even the lovers had lost their stiffness, while the two\nearth-bound fairies of the night before had found so amiable a meeting\npoint that their solos sounded, to the uninitiated, very like, indeed,\na duet. The operetta was, in short, a glorious and gratifying success,\nboth artistically and financially. Nor was this all that, to Billy, made\nlife worth the living: Arkwright had begged permission that evening to\ncome up the following afternoon to tell her his “story”; and Billy, who\nwas so joyously confident that this story meant the final crowning of\nher Cause with victory, had given happy consent.\n\nBertram was to come up in the evening, and Billy was anticipating that,\ntoo, particularly: it had been so long since they had known a really\nfree, comfortable evening together, with nothing to interrupt.\nDoubtless, too, after Arkwright's visit of the afternoon, she would be\nin a position to tell Bertram the story of the suspended romance between\nArkwright and Miss Greggory, and perhaps something, also, of her own\nefforts to bring the couple together again. On the whole, life did,\nindeed, look decidedly worth the living as Billy, with a contented sigh,\nturned over to go to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. ARKWRIGHT TELLS ANOTHER STORY\n\n\nPromptly at the suggested hour on the day after the operetta, Arkwright\nrang Billy Neilson's doorbell. Promptly, too, Billy herself came into\nthe living-room to greet him.\n\nBilly was in white to-day--a soft, creamy white wool with a touch of\nblack velvet at her throat and in her hair. The man thought she had\nnever looked so lovely: Arkwright was still under the spell wrought by\nthe soft radiance of Billy's face the two times he had mentioned his\n“story.”\n\nUntil the night before the operetta Arkwright had been more than\ndoubtful of the way that story would be received, should he ever\nsummon the courage to tell it. Since then his fears had been changed to\nrapturous hopes. It was very eagerly, therefore, that he turned now to\ngreet Billy as she came into the room.\n\n“Suppose we don't have any music to-day. Suppose we give the whole time\nup to the story,” she smiled brightly, as she held out her hand.\n\nArkwright's heart leaped; but almost at once it throbbed with a vague\nuneasiness. He would have preferred to see her blush and be a little shy\nover that story. Still--there was a chance, of course, that she did not\nknow what the story was. But if that were the case, what of the radiance\nin her face? What of--Finding himself in a tangled labyrinth that led\napparently only to disappointment and disaster, Arkwright pulled himself\nup with a firm hand.\n\n“You are very kind,” he murmured, as he relinquished her fingers and\nseated himself near her. “You are sure, then, that you wish to hear the\nstory?”\n\n“Very sure,” smiled Billy.\n\nArkwright hesitated. Again he longed to see a little embarrassment in\nthe bright face opposite. Suddenly it came to him, however, that if\nBilly knew what he was about to say, it would manifestly not be her part\nto act as if she knew! With a lighter heart, then, he began his story.\n\n“You want it from the beginning?”\n\n“By all means! I never dip into books, nor peek at the ending. I don't\nthink it's fair to the author.”\n\n“Then I will, indeed, begin at the beginning,” smiled Arkwright, “for\nI'm specially anxious that you shall be--even more than 'fair' to me.”\n His voice shook a little, but he hurried on. “There's a--girl--in it; a\nvery dear, lovely girl.”\n\n“Of course--if it's a nice story,” twinkled Billy.\n\n“And--there's a man, too. It's a love story, you see.”\n\n“Again of course--if it's interesting.” Billy laughed mischievously, but\nshe flushed a little.\n\n“Still, the man doesn't amount to much, after all, perhaps. I might as\nwell own up at the beginning--I'm the man.”\n\n“That will do for you to say, as long as you're telling the story,”\n smiled Billy. “We'll let it pass for proper modesty on your part. But I\nshall say--the personal touch only adds to the interest.”\n\nArkwright drew in his breath.\n\n“We'll hope--it'll really be so,” he murmured.\n\nThere was a moment's silence. Arkwright seemed to be hesitating what to\nsay.\n\n“Well?” prompted Billy, with a smile. “We have the hero and the heroine;\nnow what happens next? Do you know,” she added, “I have always thought\nthat part must bother the story-writers--to get the couple to doing\ninteresting things, after they'd got them introduced.”\n\nArkwright sighed.\n\n“Perhaps--on paper; but, you see, my story has been _lived_, so far. So\nit's quite different.”\n\n“Very well, then--what did happen?” smiled Billy.\n\n“I was trying to think--of the first thing. You see it began with a\npicture, a photograph of the girl. Mother had it. I saw it, and wanted\nit, and--” Arkwright had started to say “and took it.” But he stopped\nwith the last two words unsaid. It was not time, yet, he deemed, to tell\nthis girl how much that picture had been to him for so many months past.\nHe hurried on a little precipitately. “You see, I had heard about this\ngirl a lot; and I liked--what I heard.”\n\n“You mean--you didn't know her--at the first?” Billy's eyes were\nsurprised. Billy had supposed that Arkwright had always known Alice\nGreggory.\n\n“No, I didn't know the girl--till afterwards. Before that I was always\ndreaming and wondering what she would be like.”\n\n“Oh!” Billy subsided into her chair, still with the puzzled questioning\nin her eyes.\n\n“Then I met her.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“And she was everything and more than I had pictured her.”\n\n“And you fell in love at once?” Billy's voice had grown confident again.\n\n“Oh, I was already in love,” sighed Arkwright. “I simply sank deeper.”\n\n“Oh-h!” breathed Billy, sympathetically. “And the girl?”\n\n“She didn't care--or know--for a long time. I'm not really sure she\ncares--or knows--even now.” Arkwright's eyes were wistfully fixed on\nBilly's face.\n\n“Oh, but you can't tell, always, about girls,” murmured Billy,\nhurriedly. A faint pink had stolen to her forehead. She was thinking of\nAlice Greggory, and wondering if, indeed, Alice did care; and if she,\nBilly, might dare to assure this man--what she believed to be true--that\nhis sweetheart was only waiting for him to come to her and tell her that\nhe loved her.\n\nArkwright saw the color sweep to Billy's forehead, and took sudden\ncourage. He leaned forward eagerly. A tender light came to his eyes. The\nexpression on his face was unmistakable.\n\n“Billy, do you mean, really, that there is--hope for me?” he begged\nbrokenly.\n\nBilly gave a visible start. A quick something like shocked terror came\nto her eyes. She drew back and would have risen to her feet had the\nthought not come to her that twice before she had supposed a man was\nmaking love to her, when subsequent events proved that she had been\nmortifyingly mistaken: once when Cyril had told her of his love for\nMarie; and again when William had asked her to come back as a daughter\nto the house she had left desolate.\n\nTelling herself sternly now not to be for the third time a “foolish\nlittle simpleton,” she summoned all her wits, forced a cheery smile to\nher lips, and said:\n\n“Well, really, Mr. Arkwright, of course I can't answer for the girl, so\nI'm not the one to give hope; and--”\n\n“But you are the one,” interrupted the man, passionately. “You're the\nonly one! As if from the very first I hadn't loved you, and--”\n\n“No, no, not that--not that! I'm mistaken! I'm not understanding what\nyou mean,” pleaded a horror-stricken voice. Billy was on her feet now,\nholding up two protesting hands, palms outward.\n\n“Miss Neilson, you don't mean--that you haven't known--all this\ntime--that it was you?” The man, now, was on his feet, his eyes hurt and\nunbelieving, looking into hers.\n\nBilly paled. She began slowly to back away. Her eyes, still fixed on\nhis, carried the shrinking terror of one who sees a horrid vision.\n\n“But you know--you _must_ know that I am not yours to win!” she\nreproached him sharply. “I'm to be Bertram Henshaw's--_wife_.” From\nBilly's shocked young lips the word dropped with a ringing force that\nwas at once accusatory and prohibitive. It was as if, by the mere\nutterance of the word, wife, she had drawn a sacred circle about her and\nplaced herself in sanctuary.\n\nFrom the blazing accusation in her eyes Arkwright fell back.\n\n“Wife! You are to be Bertram Henshaw's wife!” he exclaimed. There was no\nmistaking the amazed incredulity on his face.\n\nBilly caught her breath. The righteous indignation in her eyes fled, and\na terrified appeal took its place.\n\n“You don't mean that you _didn't--know?_” she faltered.\n\nThere was a moment's silence. A power quite outside herself kept Billy's\neyes on Arkwright's face, and forced her to watch the change there from\nunbelief to belief, and from belief to set misery.\n\n“No, I did not know,” said the man then, dully, as he turned, rested his\narm on the mantel behind him, and half shielded his face with his hand.\n\nBilly sank into a low chair. Her fingers fluttered nervously to her\nthroat. Her piteous, beseeching eyes were on the broad back and bent\nhead of the man before her.\n\n“But I--I don't see how you could have helped--knowing,” she stammered\nat last. “I don't see how such a thing could have happened that you\nshouldn't know!”\n\n“I've been trying to think, myself,” returned the man, still in a dull,\nemotionless voice.\n\n“It's been so--so much a matter of course. I supposed everybody knew\nit,” maintained Billy.\n\n“Perhaps that's just it--that it was--so much a matter of course,”\n rejoined the man. “You see, I know very few of your friends, anyway--who\nwould be apt to mention it to me.”\n\n“But the announcements--oh, you weren't here then,” moaned Billy. “But\nyou must have known that--that he came here a good deal--that we were\ntogether so much!”\n\n“To a certain extent, yes,” sighed Arkwright. “But I took your\nfriendship with him and his brothers as--as a matter of course. _That_\nwas _my_ 'matter of course,' you see,” he went on bitterly. “I knew\nyou were Mr. William Henshaw's namesake, and Calderwell had told me\nthe story of your coming to them when you were left alone in the world.\nCalderwell had said, too, that--” Arkwright paused, then hurried on a\nlittle constrainedly--“well, he said something that led me to think Mr.\nBertram Henshaw was not a marrying man, anyway.”\n\nBilly winced and changed color. She had noticed the pause, and she knew\nvery well what it was that Calderwell had said to occasion that pause.\nMust _always_ she be reminded that no one expected Bertram Henshaw to\nlove any girl--except to paint?\n\n“But--but Mr. Calderwell must know about the engagement--now,” she\nstammered.\n\n“Very likely, but I have not happened to hear from him since my arrival\nin Boston. We do not correspond.”\n\nThere was a long silence, then Arkwright spoke again.\n\n“I think I understand now--many things. I wonder I did not see them\nbefore; but I never thought of Bertram Henshaw's being--If Calderwell\nhadn't said--” Again Arkwright stopped with his sentence half complete,\nand again Billy winced. “I've been a blind fool. I was so intent on my\nown--I've been a blind fool; that's all,” repeated Arkwright, with a\nbreak in his voice.\n\nBilly tried to speak, but instead of words, there came only a choking\nsob.\n\nArkwright turned sharply.\n\n“Miss Neilson, don't--please,” he begged. “There is no need that you\nshould suffer--too.”\n\n“But I am so ashamed that such a thing _could_ happen,” she faltered.\n“I'm sure, some way, I must be to blame. But I never thought. I was\nblind, too. I was wrapped up in my own affairs. I never suspected. I\nnever even _thought_ to suspect! I thought of course you knew. It was\njust the music that brought us together, I supposed; and you were\njust like one of the family, anyway. I always thought of you as Aunt\nHannah's--” She stopped with a vivid blush.\n\n“As Aunt Hannah's niece, Mary Jane, of course,” supplied Arkwright,\nbitterly, turning back to his old position. “And that was my own fault,\ntoo. My name, Miss Neilson, is Michael Jeremiah,” he went on wearily,\nafter a moment's hesitation, his voice showing his utter abandonment to\ndespair. “When a boy at school I got heartily sick of the 'Mike' and\nthe 'Jerry' and the even worse 'Tom and Jerry' that my young friends\ndelighted in; so as soon as possible I sought obscurity and peace in 'M.\nJ.' Much to my surprise and annoyance the initials proved to be little\nbetter, for they became at once the biggest sort of whet to people's\ncuriosity. Naturally, the more determined persistent inquirers were to\nknow the name, the more determined I became that they shouldn't. All\nvery silly and very foolish, of course. Certainly it seems so now,” he\nfinished.\n\nBilly was silent. She was trying to find something, _anything_, to say,\nwhen Arkwright began speaking again, still in that dull, hopeless voice\nthat Billy thought would break her heart.\n\n“As for the 'Mary Jane'--that was another foolishness, of course. My\nsmall brothers and sisters originated it; others followed, on occasion,\neven Calderwell. Perhaps you did not know, but he was the friend who, by\nhis laughing question, 'Why don't you, Mary Jane?' put into my head the\ncrazy scheme of writing to Aunt Hannah and letting her think I was a\nreal Mary Jane. You see what I stooped to do, Miss Neilson, for the\nchance of meeting and knowing you.”\n\nBilly gave a low cry. She had suddenly remembered the beginning of\nArkwright's story. For the first time she realized that he had been\ntalking then about herself, not Alice Greggory.\n\n“But you don't mean that you--cared--that I was the--” She could not\nfinish.\n\nArkwright turned from the mantel with a gesture of utter despair.\n\n“Yes, I cared then. I had heard of you. I had sung your songs. I was\ndetermined to meet you. So I came--and met you. After that I was more\ndetermined than ever to win you. Perhaps you see, now, why I was so\nblind to--to any other possibility. But it doesn't do any good--to talk\nlike this. I understand now. Only, please, don't blame yourself,” he\nbegged as he saw her eyes fill with tears. The next moment he was gone.\n\nBilly had turned away and was crying softly, so she did not see him go.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. THE THING THAT WAS THE TRUTH\n\n\nBertram called that evening. Billy had no story now to tell--nothing\nof the interrupted romance between Alice Greggory and Arkwright. Billy\ncarefully, indeed, avoided mentioning Arkwright's name.\n\nEver since the man's departure that afternoon, Billy had been\nfrantically trying to assure herself that she was not to blame; that she\nwould not be supposed to know he cared for her; that it had all been as\nhe said it was--his foolish blindness. But even when she had partially\ncomforted herself by these assertions, she could not by any means escape\nthe haunting vision of the man's stern-set, suffering face as she had\nseen it that afternoon; nor could she keep from weeping at the memory of\nthe words he had said, and at the thought that never again could their\npleasant friendship be quite the same--if, indeed, there could be any\nfriendship at all between them.\n\nBut if Billy expected that her red eyes, pale cheeks, and generally\ntroubled appearance and unquiet manner were to be passed unnoticed by\nher lover's keen eyes that evening, she found herself much mistaken.\n\n“Sweetheart, what _is_ the matter?” demanded Bertram resolutely, at\nlast, when his more indirect questions had been evasively turned aside.\n“You can't make me think there isn't something the trouble, because I\nknow there is!”\n\n“Well, then, there is, dear,” smiled Billy, tearfully; “but please just\ndon't let us talk of it. I--I want to forget it. Truly I do.”\n\n“But I want to know so _I_ can forget it,” persisted Bertram. “What is\nit? Maybe I could help.”\n\nShe shook her head with a little frightened cry.\n\n“No, no--you can't help--really.”\n\n“But, sweetheart, you don't know. Perhaps I could. Won't you _tell_ me\nabout it?”\n\nBilly looked distressed.\n\n“I can't, dear--truly. You see, it isn't quite mine--to tell.”\n\n“Not yours!”\n\n“Not--entirely.”\n\n“But it makes you feel bad?”\n\n“Yes--very.”\n\n“Then can't I know that part?”\n\n“Oh, no--no, indeed, no! You see--it wouldn't be fair--to the other.”\n\nBertram stared a little. Then his mouth set into stern lines.\n\n“Billy, what are you talking about? Seems to me I have a right to know.”\n\nBilly hesitated. To her mind, a girl who would tell of the unrequited\nlove of a man for herself, was unspeakably base. To tell Bertram\nArkwright's love story was therefore impossible. Yet, in some way, she\nmust set Bertram's mind at rest.\n\n“Dearest,” she began slowly, her eyes wistfully pleading, “just what it\nis, I can't tell you. In a way it's another's secret, and I don't feel\nthat I have the right to tell it. It's just something that I learned\nthis afternoon.”\n\n“But it has made you cry!”\n\n“Yes. It made me feel very unhappy.”\n\n“Then--it was something you couldn't help?”\n\nTo Bertram's surprise, the face he was watching so intently flushed\nscarlet.\n\n“No, I couldn't help it--now; though I might have--once.” Billy spoke\nthis last just above her breath. Then she went on, beseechingly:\n“Bertram, please, please don't talk of it any more. It--it's just\nspoiling our happy evening together!”\n\nBertram bit his lip, and drew a long sigh.\n\n“All right, dear; you know best, of course--since I don't know\n_anything_ about it,” he finished a little stiffly.\n\nBilly began to talk then very brightly of Aunt Hannah and her shawls,\nand of a visit she had made to Cyril and Marie that morning.\n\n“And, do you know? Aunt Hannah's clock _has_ done a good turn, at last,\nand justified its existence. Listen,” she cried gayly. “Marie had a\nletter from her mother's Cousin Jane. Cousin Jane couldn't sleep nights,\nbecause she was always lying awake to find out just what time it was;\nso Marie had written her about Aunt Hannah's clock. And now this Cousin\nJane has fixed _her_ clock, and she sleeps like a top, just because she\nknows there'll never be but half an hour that she doesn't know what time\nit is!”\n\nBertram smiled, and murmured a polite “Well, I'm sure that's fine!”; but\nthe words were plainly abstracted, and the frown had not left his brow.\nNor did it quite leave till some time later, when Billy, in answer to a\nquestion of his about another operetta, cried, with a shudder:\n\n“Mercy, I hope not, dear! I don't want to _hear_ the word 'operetta'\nagain for a year!”\n\nBertram smiled, then, broadly. He, too, would be quite satisfied not\nto hear the word “operetta” for a year. Operetta, to Bertram, meant\ninterruptions, interferences, and the constant presence of Arkwright,\nthe Greggorys, and innumerable creatures who wished to rehearse or to\nchange wigs--all of which Bertram abhorred. No wonder, therefore, that\nhe smiled, and that the frown disappeared from his brow. He thought he\nsaw, ahead, serene, blissful days for Billy and himself.\n\nAs the days, however, began to pass, one by one, Bertram Henshaw found\nthem to be anything but serene and blissful. The operetta, with its\nrehearsals and its interruptions, was gone, certainly; but he was\nbecoming seriously troubled about Billy.\n\nBilly did not act natural. Sometimes she seemed like her old self; and\nhe breathed more freely, telling himself that his fears were groundless.\nThen would come the haunting shadow to her eyes, the droop to her mouth,\nand the nervousness to her manner that he so dreaded. Worse yet, all\nthis seemed to be connected in some strange way with Arkwright. He found\nthis out by accident one day. She had been talking and laughing brightly\nabout something, when he chanced to introduce Arkwright's name.\n\n“By the way, where is Mary Jane these days?” he asked then.\n\n“I don't know, I'm sure. He hasn't been here lately,” murmured Billy,\nreaching for a book on the table.\n\nAt a peculiar something in her voice, he had looked up quickly, only to\nfind, to his great surprise, that her face showed a painful flush as she\nbent over the book in her hand.\n\nHe had said nothing more at the time, but he had not forgotten. Several\ntimes, after that, he had introduced the man's name, and never had it\nfailed to bring a rush of color, a biting of the lip, or a quick change\nof position followed always by the troubled eyes and nervous manner that\nhe had learned to dread. He noticed then that never, of her own free\nwill, did she herself mention the man; never did she speak of him with\nthe old frank lightness as “Mary Jane.”\n\nBy casual questions asked from time to time, Bertram had learned that\nArkwright never came there now, and that the song-writing together had\nbeen given up. Curiously enough, this discovery, which would once have\nfilled Bertram with joy, served now only to deepen his distress. That\nthere was anything inconsistent in the fact that he was more frightened\nnow at the man's absence than he had been before at his presence,\ndid not occur to him. He knew only that he was frightened, and badly\nfrightened.\n\nBertram had not forgotten the evening after the operetta, and Billy's\ntear-stained face on that occasion. He dated the whole thing, in fact,\nfrom that evening. He fell to wondering one day if that, too, had\nanything to do with Arkwright. He determined then to find out.\nShamelessly--for the good of the cause--he set a trap for Billy's unwary\nfeet.\n\nVery adroitly one day he led the talk straight to Arkwright; then he\nasked abruptly:\n\n“Where is the chap, I wonder! Why, he hasn't shown up once since the\noperetta, has he?”\n\nBilly, always truthful,--and just now always embarrassed when\nArkwright's name was mentioned,--walked straight into the trap.\n\n“Oh, yes; well, he was here once--the day after the operetta. I haven't\nseen him since.”\n\nBertram answered a light something, but his face grew a little white.\nNow that the trap had been sprung and the victim caught, he almost\nwished that he had not set any trap at all.\n\nHe knew now it was true. Arkwright had been with Billy the day after the\noperetta, and her tears and her distress that evening had been caused by\nsomething Arkwright had said. It was Arkwright's secret that she could\nnot tell. It was Arkwright to whom she must be fair. It was Arkwright's\nsorrow that she “could not help--now.”\n\nNaturally, with these tools in his hands, and aided by days of brooding\nand nights of sleeplessness, it did not take Bertram long to fashion The\nThing that finally loomed before him as The Truth.\n\nHe understood it all now. Music had conquered. Billy and Arkwright had\nfound that they loved each other. On the day after the operetta, they\nhad met, and had had some sort of scene together--doubtless Arkwright\nhad declared his love. That was the “secret” that Billy could not tell\nand be “fair.” Billy, of course,--loyal little soul that she was,--had\nsent him away at once. Was her hand not already pledged? That was why\nshe could not “help it-now.” (Bertram writhed in agony at the thought.)\nSince that meeting Arkwright had not been near the house. Billy had\nfound, however, that her heart had gone with Arkwright; hence the shadow\nin her eyes, the nervousness in her manner, and the embarrassment that\nshe always showed at the mention of his name.\n\nThat Billy was still outwardly loyal to himself, and that she still kept\nto her engagement, did not surprise Bertram in the least. That was like\nBilly. Bertram had not forgotten how, less than a year before, this same\nBilly had held herself loyal and true to an engagement with William,\nbecause a wretched mistake all around had caused her to give her promise\nto be William's wife under the impression that she was carrying out\nWilliam's dearest wish. Bertram remembered her face as it had looked all\nthose long summer days while her heart was being slowly broken; and he\nthought he could see that same look in her eyes now. All of which only\ngoes to prove with what woeful skill Bertram had fashioned this Thing\nthat was looming before him as The Truth.\n\nThe exhibition of “The Bohemian Ten” was to open with a private view\non the evening of the twentieth of March. Bertram Henshaw's one\ncontribution was to be his portrait of Miss Marguerite Winthrop--the\npiece of work that had come to mean so much to him; the piece of work\nupon which already he felt the focus of multitudes of eyes.\n\nMiss Winthrop was in Boston now, and it was during these early March\ndays that Bertram was supposed to be putting in his best work on the\nportrait; but, unfortunately, it was during these same early March days\nthat he was engaged, also, in fashioning The Thing--and the two did not\nharmonize.\n\nThe Thing, indeed, was a jealous creature, and would brook no rival.\nShe filled his eyes with horrid visions, and his brain with sickening\nthoughts. Between him and his model she flung a veil of fear; and she\nset his hand to trembling, and his brush to making blunders with the\npaints on his palette.\n\nBertram saw The Thing, and saw, too, the grievous result of her\npresence. Despairingly he fought against her and her work; but The Thing\nhad become full grown now, and was The Truth. Hence she was not to be\nbanished. She even, in a taunting way, seemed sometimes to be justifying\nher presence, for she reminded him:\n\n“After all, what's the difference? What do you care for this, or\nanything again if Billy is lost to you?”\n\nBut the artist told himself fiercely that he did care--that he must\ncare--for his work; and he struggled--how he struggled!--to ignore the\nhorrid visions and the sickening thoughts, and to pierce the veil of\nfear so that his hand might be steady and his brush regain its skill.\n\nAnd so he worked. Sometimes he let his work remain. Sometimes one hour\nsaw only the erasing of what the hour before had wrought. Sometimes the\nelusive something in Marguerite Winthrop's face seemed right at the tip\nof his brush--on the canvas, even. He saw success then so plainly that\nfor a moment it almost--but not quite--blotted out The Thing. At other\ntimes that elusive something on the high-bred face of his model was a\nveritable will-o'-the-wisp, refusing to be caught and held, even in his\neye. The artist knew then that his picture would be hung with Anderson's\nand Fullam's.\n\nBut the portrait was, irrefutably, nearing completion, and it was to be\nexhibited the twentieth of the month. Bertram knew these for facts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. BILLY TAKES HER TURN\n\n\nIf for Billy those first twenty days of March did not carry quite the\ntragedy they contained for Bertram, they were, nevertheless, not really\nhappy ones. She was vaguely troubled by a curious something in Bertram's\nbehavior that she could not name; she was grieved over Arkwright's\nsorrow, and she was constantly probing her own past conduct to see\nif anywhere she could find that she was to blame for that sorrow. She\nmissed, too, undeniably, Arkwright's cheery presence, and the charm\nand inspiration of his music. Nor was she finding it easy to give\nsatisfactory answers to the questions Aunt Hannah, William, and Bertram\nso often asked her as to where Mary Jane was.\n\nEven her music was little comfort to her these days. She was not\nwriting anything. There was no song in her heart to tempt her to write.\nArkwright's new words that he had brought her were out of the question,\nof course. They had been put away with the manuscript of the completed\nsong, which had not, fortunately, gone to the publishers. Billy had\nwaited, intending to send them together. She was so glad, now, that she\nhad waited. Just once, since Arkwright's last call, she had tried to\nsing that song. But she had stopped at the end of the first two lines.\nThe full meaning of those words, as coming from Arkwright, had swept\nover her then, and she had snatched up the manuscript and hidden it\nunder the bottom pile of music in her cabinet ... And she had presumed\nto sing that love song to Bertram!\n\nArkwright had written Billy once--a kind, courteous, manly note that had\nmade her cry. He had begged her again not to blame herself, and he had\nsaid that he hoped he should be strong enough sometime to wish to call\noccasionally--if she were willing--and renew their pleasant hours with\ntheir music; but, for the present, he knew there was nothing for him to\ndo but to stay away. He had signed himself “Michael Jeremiah Arkwright”;\nand to Billy that was the most pathetic thing in the letter--it sounded\nso hopeless and dreary to one who knew the jaunty “M. J.”\n\nAlice Greggory, Billy saw frequently. Billy and Aunt Hannah were great\nfriends with the Greggorys now, and had been ever since the Greggorys'\nten-days' visit at Hillside. The cheery little cripple, with the gentle\ntap, tap, tap of her crutches, had won everybody's heart the very\nfirst day; and Alice was scarcely less of a favorite, after the sunny\nfriendliness of Hillside had thawed her stiff reserve into naturalness.\n\nBilly had little to say to Alice Greggory of Arkwright. Billy was no\nlonger trying to play Cupid's assistant. The Cause, for which she had\nso valiantly worked, had been felled by Arkwright's own hand--but that\nthere were still some faint stirrings of life in it was evidenced by\nBilly's secret delight when one day Alice Greggory chanced to mention\nthat Arkwright had called the night before upon her and her mother.\n\n“He brought us news of our old home,” she explained a little hurriedly,\nto Billy. “He had heard from his mother, and he thought some things she\nsaid would be interesting to us.”\n\n“Of course,” murmured Billy, carefully excluding from her voice any hint\nof the delight she felt, but hoping, all the while, that Alice would\ncontinue the subject.\n\nAlice, however, had nothing more to say; and Billy was left in\nentire ignorance of what the news was that Arkwright had brought.\nShe suspected, though, that it had something to do with Alice's\nfather--certainly she hoped that it had; for if Arkwright had called to\ntell it, it must be good.\n\nBilly had found a new home for the Greggorys; although at first they had\ndrawn sensitively back, and had said that they preferred to remain where\nthey were, they had later gratefully accepted it. A little couple from\nSouth Boston, to whom Billy had given a two weeks' outing the summer\nbefore, had moved into town and taken a flat in the South End. They had\ntwo extra rooms which they had told Billy they would like to let for\nlight house-keeping, if only they knew just the right people to take\ninto such close quarters with themselves. Billy at once thought of the\nGreggorys, and spoke of them. The little couple were delighted, and the\nGreggorys were scarcely less so when they at last became convinced that\nonly a very little more money than they were already paying would give\nthemselves a much pleasanter home, and would at the same time be a real\nboon to two young people who were trying to meet expenses. So the change\nwas made, and general happiness all round had resulted--so much so, that\nBertram had said to Billy, when he heard of it:\n\n“It looks as if this was a case where your cake is frosted on both\nsides.”\n\n“Nonsense! This isn't frosting--it's business,” Billy had laughed.\n\n“And the new pupils you have found for Miss Alice--they're business,\ntoo, I suppose?”\n\n“Certainly,” retorted Billy, with decision. Then she had given a low\nlaugh and said: “Mercy! If Alice Greggory thought it was anything _but_\nbusiness, I verily believe she would refuse every one of the new pupils,\nand begin to-night to carry back the tables and chairs herself to those\nwretched rooms she left last month!”\n\nBertram had smiled, but the smile had been a fleeting one, and the\nbrooding look of gloom that Billy had noticed so frequently, of late,\nhad come back to his eyes.\n\nBilly was not a little disturbed over Bertram these days. He did not\nseem to be his natural, cheery self at all. He talked little, and what\nhe did say seldom showed a trace of his usually whimsical way of putting\nthings. He was kindness itself to her, and seemed particularly anxious\nto please her in every way; but she frequently found his eyes fixed on\nher with a sombre questioning that almost frightened her. The more she\nthought of it, the more she wondered what the question was, that he did\nnot dare to ask; and whether it was of herself or himself that he would\nask it--if he did dare. Then, with benumbing force, one day, a possible\nsolution of the mystery came to her, he had found out that it was true\n(what all his friends had declared of him)--he did not really love any\ngirl, except to paint!\n\nThe minute this thought came to her, Billy thrust it indignantly away.\nIt was disloyal to Bertram and unworthy of herself, even to think such\na thing. She told herself then that it was only the portrait of Miss\nWinthrop that was troubling him. She knew that he was worried over that.\nHe had confessed to her that actually sometimes he was beginning to fear\nhis hand had lost its cunning. As if that were not enough to bring the\ngloom to any man's face--to any artist's!\n\nNo sooner, however, had Billy arrived at this point in her mental\nargument, than a new element entered--her old lurking jealousy, of which\nshe was heartily ashamed, but which she had never yet been able quite to\nsubdue; her jealousy of the beautiful girl with the beautiful name (not\nBilly), whose portrait had needed so much time and so many sittings to\nfinish. What if Bertram had found that he loved _her?_ What if that\nwere why his hand had lost its cunning--because, though loving her, he\nrealized that he was bound to another, Billy herself?\n\nThis thought, too, Billy cast from her at once as again disloyal and\nunworthy. But both thoughts, having once entered her brain, had made for\nthemselves roads over which the second passing was much easier than the\nfirst--as Billy found to her sorrow. Certainly, as the days went by,\nand as Bertram's face and manner became more and more a tragedy of\nsuffering, Billy found it increasingly difficult to keep those\nthoughts from wearing their roads of suspicion into horrid deep ruts of\ncertainty.\n\nOnly with William and Marie, now, could Billy escape from it all. With\nWilliam she sought new curios and catalogued the old. With Marie she\nbeat eggs and whipped cream in the shining kitchen, and tried to think\nthat nothing in the world mattered except that the cake in the oven\nshould not fall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. KATE WRITES A LETTER\n\n\nBertram feared that he knew, before the portrait was hung, that it was\na failure. He was sure that he knew it on the evening of the twentieth\nwhen he encountered the swiftly averted eyes of some of his artist\nfriends, and saw the perplexed frown on the faces of others. But he\nknew, afterwards, that he did not really know it--till he read the\nnewspapers during the next few days.\n\nThere was praise--oh, yes; the faint praise that kills. There was some\nadverse criticism, too; but it was of the light, insincere variety that\nis given to mediocre work by unimportant artists. Then, here and there,\nappeared the signed critiques of the men whose opinion counted--and\nBertram knew that he had failed. Neither as a work of art, nor as a\nlikeness, was the portrait the success that Henshaw's former work would\nseem to indicate that it should have been. Indeed, as one caustic pen\nput it, if this were to be taken as a sample of what was to follow--then\nthe famous originator of “The Face of a Girl” had “a most distinguished\nfuture behind him.”\n\nSeldom, if ever before, had an exhibited portrait attracted so much\nattention. As Bertram had said, uncounted eyes were watching for it\nbefore it was hung, because it was a portrait of the noted beauty,\nMarguerite Winthrop, and because two other well-known artists had failed\nwhere he, Bertram Henshaw, was hoping to succeed. After it was hung, and\nthe uncounted eyes had seen it--either literally, or through the eyes\nof the critics--interest seemed rather to grow than to lessen, for other\nuncounted eyes wanted to see what all the fuss was about, anyway. And\nwhen these eyes had seen, their owners talked. Nor did they, by any\nmeans, all talk against the portrait. Some were as loud in its praise as\nwere others in its condemnation; all of which, of course, but helped to\nattract more eyes to the cause of it all.\n\nFor Bertram and his friends these days were, naturally, trying ones.\nWilliam finally dreaded to open his newspaper. (It had become the\nfashion, when murders and divorces were scarce, occasionally to\n“feature” somebody's opinion of the Henshaw portrait, on the first\npage--something that had almost never been known to happen before.)\nCyril, according to Marie, played “perfectly awful things on his piano\nevery day, now.” Aunt Hannah had said “Oh, my grief and conscience!”\n so many times that it melted now into a wordless groan whenever a new\nunfriendly criticism of the portrait met her indignant eyes.\n\nOf all Bertram's friends, Billy, perhaps not unnaturally, was the\nangriest. Not only did she, after a time, refuse to read the papers,\nbut she refused even to allow certain ones to be brought into the house,\nfoolish and unreasonable as she knew this to be.\n\nAs to the artist himself, Bertram's face showed drawn lines and his eyes\nsombre shadows, but his words and manner carried a stolid indifference\nthat to Billy was at once heartbreaking and maddening.\n\n“But, Bertram, why don't you do something? Why don't you say something?\nWhy don't you act something?” she burst out one day.\n\nThe artist shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“But, my dear, what can I say, or do, or act?” he asked.\n\n“I don't know, of course,” sighed Billy. “But I know what I'd like to\ndo. I should like to go out and--fight somebody!”\n\nSo fierce were words and manner, coupled as they were with a pair of\ngentle eyes ablaze and two soft little hands doubled into menacing\nfists, that Bertram laughed.\n\n“What a fiery little champion it is, to be sure,” he said tenderly. “But\nas if fighting could do any good--in this case!”\n\nBilly's tense muscles relaxed. Her eyes filled with tears.\n\n“No, I don't suppose it would,” she choked, beginning to cry, so that\nBertram had to turn comforter.\n\n“Come, come, dear,” he begged; “don't take it so to heart. It's not\nso bad, after all. I've still my good right hand left, and we'll hope\nthere's something in it yet--that'll be worth while.”\n\n“But _this_ one isn't bad,” stormed Billy. “It's splendid! I'm sure, I\nthink it's a b-beautiful portrait, and I don't see _what_ people mean by\ntalking so about it!”\n\nBertram shook his head. His eyes grew sombre again.\n\n“Thank you, dear. But I know--and you know, really--that it isn't a\nsplendid portrait. I've done lots better work than that.”\n\n“Then why don't they look at those, and let this alone?” wailed Billy,\nwith indignation.\n\n“Because I deliberately put up this for them to see,” smiled the artist,\nwearily.\n\nBilly sighed, and twisted in her chair.\n\n“What does--Mr. Winthrop say?” she asked at last, in a faint voice.\n\nBertram lifted his head.\n\n“Mr. Winthrop's been a trump all through, dear. He's already insisted on\npaying for this--and he's ordered another.”\n\n“Another!”\n\n“Yes. The old fellow never minces his words, as you may know. He came\nto me one day, put his hand on my shoulder, and said tersely: 'Will you\ngive me another, same terms? Go in, boy, and win. Show 'em! I lost\nthe first ten thousand I made. I didn't the next!' That's all he said.\nBefore I could even choke out an answer he was gone. Gorry! talk about\nhis having a 'heart of stone'! I don't believe another man in the\ncountry would have done that--and done it in the way he did--in the face\nof all this talk,” finished Bertram, his eyes luminous with feeling.\n\nBilly hesitated.\n\n“Perhaps--his daughter--influenced him--some.”\n\n“Perhaps,” nodded Bertram. “She, too, has been very kind, all the way\nthrough.”\n\nBilly hesitated again.\n\n“But I thought--it was going so splendidly,” she faltered, in a\nhalf-stifled voice.\n\n“So it was--at the first.”\n\n“Then what--ailed it, at the last, do you suppose?” Billy was holding\nher breath till he should answer.\n\nThe man got to his feet.\n\n“Billy, don't--don't ask me,” he begged. “Please don't let's talk of\nit any more. It can't do any good! I just flunked--that's all. My\nhand failed me. Maybe I tried too hard. Maybe I was tired. Maybe\nsomething--troubled me. Never mind, dear, what it was. It can do no good\neven to think of that--now. So just let's--drop it, please, dear,” he\nfinished, his face working with emotion.\n\nAnd Billy dropped it--so far as words were concerned; but she could not\ndrop it from her thoughts--specially after Kate's letter came.\n\nKate's letter was addressed to Billy, and it said, after speaking of\nvarious other matters:\n\n“And now about poor Bertram's failure.” (Billy frowned. In Billy's\npresence no one was allowed to say “Bertram's failure”; but a letter\nhas a most annoying privilege of saying what it pleases without let or\nhindrance, unless one tears it up--and a letter destroyed unread remains\nalways such a tantalizing mystery of possibilities! So Billy let the\nletter talk.) “Of course we have heard of it away out here. I do wish if\nBertram _must_ paint such famous people, he would manage to flatter them\nup--in the painting, I mean, of course--enough so that it might pass for\na success!\n\n“The technical part of all this criticism I don't pretend to understand\nin the least; but from what I hear and read, he must, indeed, have made\na terrible mess of it, and of course I'm very sorry--and some surprised,\ntoo, for usually he paints such pretty pictures!\n\n“Still, on the other hand, Billy, I'm not surprised. William says that\nBertram has been completely out of fix over something, and as gloomy as\nan owl, for weeks past; and of course, under those circumstances, the\npoor boy could not be expected to do good work. Now William, being a\nman, is not supposed to understand what the trouble is. But I, being a\nwoman, can see through a pane of glass when it's held right up before\nme; and I can guess, of course, that a woman is at the bottom of it--she\nalways is!--and that you, being his special fancy at the moment” (Billy\nalmost did tear the letter now--but not quite), “are that woman.\n\n“Now, Billy, you don't like such frank talk, of course; but, on the\nother hand, I know you do not want to ruin the dear boy's career. So,\nfor heaven's sake, if you two have been having one of those quarrels\nthat lovers so delight in--do, please, for the good of the cause, make\nup quick, or else quarrel harder and break it off entirely--which,\nhonestly, would be the better way, I think, all around.\n\n“There, there, my dear child, don't bristle up! I am very fond of you,\nand would dearly love to have you for a sister--if you'd only take\nWilliam, as you should! But, as you very well know, I never did approve\nof this last match at all, for either of your sakes.\n\n“He can't make you happy, my dear, and you can't make him happy.\nBertram never was--and never will be--a marrying man. He's too\ntemperamental--too thoroughly wrapped up in his Art. Girls have never\nmeant anything to him but a beautiful picture to paint. And they never\nwill. They can't. He's made that way. Listen! I can prove it to you. Up\nto this winter he's always been a care-free, happy, jolly fellow, and\nyou _know_ what beautiful work he has done. Never before has he tied\nhimself to any one girl till last fall. Then you two entered into this\nabsurd engagement.\n\n“Now what has it been since? William wrote me himself not a fortnight\nago that he'd been worried to death over Bertram for weeks past,\nhe's been so moody, so irritable, so fretted over his work, so unlike\nhimself. And his picture has _failed_ dismally. Of course William\ndoesn't understand; but I do. I know you've probably quarrelled, or\nsomething. You know how flighty and unreliable you can be sometimes,\nBilly, and I don't say that to mean anything against you, either--that's\n_your_ way. You're just as temperamental in your art, music, as Bertram\nis in his. You're utterly unsuited to him. If Bertram is to marry\n_anybody_, it should be some quiet, staid, sensible girl who would be\na _help_ to him. But when I think of you two flyaway flutterbudgets\nmarrying--!\n\n“Now, for heaven's sake, Billy, _do_ make up or something--and do it\nnow. Don't, for pity's sake, let Bertram ever put out another such a\npiece of work to shame us all like this. Do you want to ruin his career?\n\n“Faithfully yours,\n\n“KATE HARTWELL.\n\n“P. S. _I_ think William's the one for you. He's devoted to you, and\nhis quiet, sensible affection is just what your temperament needs. I\n_always_ thought William was the one for you. Think it over.\n\n“P. S. No. 2. You can see by the above that it isn't you I'm objecting\nto, my dear. It's just _you-and-Bertram_.\n\n“K.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. “I'VE HINDERED HIM”\n\n\nBilly was shaking with anger and terror by the time she had finished\nreading Kate's letter. Anger was uppermost at the moment, and with one\nsweeping wrench of her trembling fingers she tore the closely written\nsheets straight through the middle, and flung them into the little\nwicker basket by her desk. Then she went down-stairs and played her\nnoisiest, merriest Tarantella, and tried to see how fast she could make\nher fingers fly.\n\nBut Billy could not, of course, play tarantellas all day; and even while\nshe did play them she could not forget that waste-basket up-stairs, and\nthe horror it contained. The anger was still uppermost, but the terror\nwas prodding her at every turn, and demanding to know just what it was\nthat Kate had written in that letter, anyway. It is not strange then,\nperhaps, that before two hours passed, Billy went up-stairs, took the\nletter from the basket, matched together the torn half-sheets and forced\nher shrinking eyes to read every word again-just to satisfy that terror\nwhich would not be silenced.\n\nAt the end of the second reading, Billy reminded herself with stern\ncalmness that it was only Kate, after all; that nobody ought to mind\nwhat Kate said; that certainly _she_, Billy, ought not--after the\nexperience she had already had with her unpleasant interference! Kate\ndid not know what she was talking about, anyway. This was only another\ncase of her trying “to manage.” She did so love to manage--everything!\n\nAt this point Billy got out her pen and paper and wrote to Kate.\n\nIt was a formal, cold little letter, not at all the sort that Billy's\nfriends usually received. It thanked Kate for her advice, and for\nher “kind willingness” to have Billy for a sister; but it hinted that\nperhaps Kate did not realize that as long as Billy was the one who would\nhave to _live_ with the chosen man, it would be pleasanter to take the\none Billy loved, which happened in this case to be Bertram--not William.\nAs for any “quarrel” being the cause of whatever fancied trouble there\nwas with the new picture--the letter scouted that idea in no uncertain\nterms. There had been no suggestion of a quarrel even once since the\nengagement.\n\nThen Billy signed her name and took the letter out to post immediately.\n\nFor the first few minutes after the letter had been dropped into the\ngreen box at the corner, Billy held her head high, and told herself that\nthe matter was now closed. She had sent Kate a courteous, dignified,\nconclusive, effectual answer, and she thought with much satisfaction of\nthe things she had said.\n\nVery soon, however, she began to think--not so much of what _she_\nhad said--but of what Kate had said. Many of Kate's sentences were\nunpleasantly vivid in her mind. They seemed, indeed, to stand out in\nletters of flame, and they began to burn, and burn, and burn. These were\nsome of them:\n\n“William says that Bertram has been completely out of fix over\nsomething, and as gloomy as an owl for weeks past.”\n\n“A woman is at the bottom of it--... you are that woman.”\n\n“You can't make him happy.”\n\n“Bertram never was--and never will be--a marrying man.”\n\n“Girls have never meant anything to him but a beautiful picture to\npaint. And they never will.”\n\n“Up to this winter he's always been a carefree, happy, jolly fellow,\nand you _know_ what beautiful work he has done. Never before has he tied\nhimself to any one girl until last fall.”\n\n“Now what has it been since?”\n\n“He's been so moody, so irritable, so fretted over his work, so unlike\nhimself; and his picture has failed, dismally.”\n\n“Do you want to ruin his career?”\n\nBilly began to see now that she had not really answered Kate's letter at\nall. The matter was not closed. Her reply had been, perhaps, courteous\nand dignified--but it had not been conclusive nor effectual.\n\nBilly had reached home now, and she was crying. Bertram _had_ acted\nstrangely, of late. Bertram _had_ seemed troubled over something. His\npicture _had_--With a little shudder Billy tossed aside these thoughts,\nand dug at her teary eyes with a determined hand. Fiercely she told\nherself that the matter _was_ settled. Very scornfully she declared that\nit was “only Kate,” after all, and that she _would not_ let Kate make\nher unhappy again! Forthwith she picked up a current magazine and began\nto read.\n\nAs it chanced, however, even here Billy found no peace; for the first\narticle she opened to was headed in huge black type:\n\n\n“MARRIAGE AND THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT.”\n\n\nWith a little cry Billy flung the magazine far from her, and picked up\nanother. But even “The Elusiveness of Chopin,” which she found here,\ncould not keep her thoughts nor her eyes from wandering to the discarded\nthing in the corner, lying ignominiously face down with crumpled,\nout-flung leaves.\n\nBilly knew that in the end she should go over and pick that magazine\nup, and read that article from beginning to end. She was not surprised,\ntherefore, when she did it--but she was not any the happier for having\ndone it.\n\nThe writer of the article did not approve of marriage and the artistic\ntemperament. He said the artist belonged to his Art, and to posterity\nthrough his Art. The essay fairly bristled with many-lettered words and\nhigh-sounding phrases, few of which Billy really understood. She did\nunderstand enough, however, to feel, guiltily, when the thing was\nfinished, that already she had married Bertram, and by so doing had\ncommitted a Crime. She had slain Art, stifled Ambition, destroyed\nInspiration, and been a nuisance generally. In consequence of which\nBertram would henceforth and forevermore be doomed to Littleness.\n\nNaturally, in this state of mind, and with this vision before her, Billy\nwas anything but her bright, easy self when she met Bertram an hour or\ntwo later. Naturally, too, Bertram, still the tormented victim of the\nbugaboo his jealous fears had fashioned, was just in the mood to\nplace the worst possible construction on his sweetheart's very evident\nunhappiness. With sighs, unspoken questions, and frequently averted\neyes, therefore, the wretched evening passed, a pitiful misery to them\nboth.\n\nDuring the days that followed, Billy thought that the world itself\nmust be in league with Kate, so often did she encounter Kate's letter\nmasquerading under some thin disguise. She did not stop to realize that\nbecause she was so afraid she _would_ find it, she _did_ find it. In\nthe books she read, in the plays she saw, in the chance words she heard\nspoken by friend or stranger--always there was something to feed her\nfears in one way or another. Even in a yellowed newspaper that had\ncovered the top shelf in her closet she found one day a symposium\non whether or not an artist's wife should be an artist; and she\nshuddered--but she read every opinion given.\n\nSome writers said no, and some, yes; and some said it all depended--on\nthe artist and his wife. Billy found much food for thought, some for\namusement, and a little that made for peace of mind. On the whole\nit opened up a new phase of the matter, perhaps. At all events, upon\nfinishing it she almost sobbed:\n\n“One would think that just because I write a song now and then, I was\ngoing to let Bertram starve, and go with holes in his socks and no\nbuttons on his clothes!”\n\nIt was that afternoon that Billy went to see Marie; but even there she\ndid not escape, for the gentle Marie all unknowingly added her mite to\nthe woeful whole.\n\nBilly found Marie in tears.\n\n“Why, Marie!” she cried in dismay.\n\n“Sh-h!” warned Marie, turning agonized eyes toward the closed door of\nCyril's den.\n\n“But, dear, what is it?” begged Billy, with no less dismay, but with\ngreater caution.\n\n“Sh-h!” admonished Marie again.\n\nOn tiptoe, then, she led the way to a room at the other end of the tiny\napartment. Once there; she explained in a more natural tone of voice:\n\n“Cyril's at work on a new piece for the piano.”\n\n“Well, what if he is?” demanded Billy. “That needn't make you cry, need\nit?”\n\n“Oh, no--no, indeed,” demurred Marie, in a shocked voice.\n\n“Well, then, what is it?”\n\nMarie hesitated; then, with the abandon of a hurt child that longs for\nsympathy, she sobbed:\n\n“It--it's just that I'm afraid, after all, that I'm not good enough for\nCyril.”\n\nBilly stared frankly.\n\n“Not _good_ enough, Marie Henshaw! Whatever in the world do you mean?”\n\n“Well, not good _for_ him, then. Listen! To-day, I know, in lots of\nways I must have disappointed him. First, he put on some socks that I'd\ndarned. They were the first since our marriage that I'd found to\ndarn, and I'd been so proud and--and happy while I _was_ darning them.\nBut--but he took 'em off right after breakfast and threw 'em in a\ncorner. Then he put on a new pair, and said that I--I needn't darn any\nmore; that it made--bunches. Billy, _my darns--bunches!_” Marie's face\nand voice were tragic.\n\n“Nonsense, dear! Don't let that fret you,” comforted Billy, promptly,\ntrying not to laugh too hard. “It wasn't _your_ darns; it was just\ndarns--anybody's darns. Cyril won't wear darned socks. Aunt Hannah told\nme so long ago, and I said then there'd be a tragedy when _you_ found it\nout. So don't worry over that.”\n\n“Oh, but that isn't all,” moaned Marie. “Listen! You know how quiet he\nmust have everything when he's composing--and he ought to have it, too!\nBut I forgot, this morning, and put on some old shoes that didn't have\nany rubber heels, and I ran the carpet sweeper, and I rattled tins in\nthe kitchen. But I never thought a thing until he opened his door and\nasked me _please_ to change my shoes and let the--the confounded dirt\ngo, and didn't I have any dishes in the house but what were made of that\nabominable tin s-stuff,” she finished in a wail of misery.\n\nBilly burst into a ringing laugh, but Marie's aghast face and upraised\nhand speedily reduced it to a convulsive giggle.\n\n“You dear child! Cyril's always like that when he's composing,” soothed\nBilly. “I supposed you knew it, dear. Don't you fret! Run along and make\nhim his favorite pudding, and by night both of you will have forgotten\nthere ever were such things in the world as tins and shoes and carpet\nsweepers that clatter.”\n\nMarie shook her head. Her dismal face did not relax.\n\n“You don't understand,” she moaned. “It's myself. I've _hindered_ him!”\n She brought out the word with an agony of slow horror. “And only to-day\nI read-here, look!” she faltered, going to the table and picking up with\nshaking hands a magazine.\n\nBilly recognized it by the cover at once--another like it had been flung\nnot so long ago by her own hand into the corner. She was not surprised,\ntherefore, to see very soon at the end of Marie's trembling finger:\n\n“Marriage and the Artistic Temperament.”\n\nBilly did not give a ringing laugh this time. She gave an involuntary\nlittle shudder, though she tried valiantly to turn it all off with a\nlight word of scorn, and a cheery pat on Marie's heaving shoulders. But\nshe went home very soon; and it was plain to be seen that her visit to\nMarie had not brought her peace.\n\nBilly knew Kate's letter, by heart, now, both in the original, and in\nits different versions, and she knew that, despite her struggles, she\nwas being forced straight toward Kate's own verdict: that she, Billy,\n_was_ the cause, in some way, of the deplorable change in Bertram's\nappearance, manner, and work. Before she would quite surrender to this\nheart-sickening belief, however, she determined to ask Bertram himself.\nFalteringly, but resolutely, therefore, one day, she questioned him.\n\n“Bertram, once you hinted that the picture did not go right because you\nwere troubled over something; and I've been wondering--was it about--me,\nin any way, that you were troubled?”\n\nBilly had her answer before the man spoke. She had it in the quick\nterror that sprang to his eyes, and the dull red that swept from his\nneck to his forehead. His reply, so far as words went did not count, for\nit evaded everything and told nothing. But Billy knew without words.\nShe knew, too, what she must do. For the time being she took Bertram's\nevasive answer as he so evidently wished it to be taken; but that\nevening, after he had gone, she wrote him a little note and broke the\nengagement. So heartbroken was she--and so fearful was she that he\nshould suspect this--that her note, when completed, was a cold little\nthing of few words, which carried no hint that its very coldness was but\nthe heart-break in the disguise of pride.\n\nThis was like Billy in all ways. Billy, had she lived in the days of\nthe Christian martyrs, would have been the first to walk with head erect\ninto the Arena of Sacrifice. The arena now was just everyday living, the\nlions were her own devouring misery, and the cause was Bertram's best\ngood.\n\nFrom Bertram's own self she had it now--that she had been the cause of\nhis being troubled; so she could doubt no longer. The only part that was\nuncertain was the reason why he had been troubled. Whether his bond to\nher had become irksome because of his love for another, or because of\nhis love for no girl--except to paint, Billy did not know. But that it\nwas irksome she did not doubt now. Besides, as if she were going to slay\nhis Art, stifle his Ambition, destroy his Inspiration, and be a nuisance\ngenerally just so that _she_ might be happy! Indeed, no! Hence she broke\nthe engagement.\n\nThis was the letter:\n\n\n     “DEAR BERTRAM:--You won't make the\n     move, so I must. I knew, from the way you spoke\n     to-day, that it _was_ about me that you were\n     troubled, even though you generously tried to\n     make me think it was not. And so the picture did\n     not go well.\n\n     “Now, dear, we have not been happy together\n     lately. You have seen it; so have I. I fear our\n     engagement was a mistake, so I'm going to send\n     back your ring to-morrow, and I'm writing this\n     letter to-night. Please don't try to see me just\n     yet. You _know_ what I am doing is best--all\n     round.\n               “Always your friend,\n                       “BILLY.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. FLIGHT\n\n\nBilly feared if she did not mail the letter at once she would not have\nthe courage to mail it at all. So she slipped down-stairs very quietly\nand went herself to the post box a little way down the street; then she\ncame back and sobbed herself to sleep--though not until after she had\nsobbed awake for long hours of wretchedness.\n\nWhen she awoke in the morning, heavy-eyed and unrested, there came to\nher first the vague horror of some shadow hanging over her, then the\nsickening consciousness of what that shadow was. For one wild minute\nBilly felt that she must run to the telephone, summon Bertram, and\nbeseech him to return unread the letter he would receive from her that\nday. Then there came to her the memory of Bertram's face as it had\nlooked the night before when she had asked him if she were the cause of\nhis being troubled. There came, too, the memory of Kate's scathing\n“Do you want to ruin his career?” Even the hated magazine article and\nMarie's tragic “I've _hindered_ him!” added their mite; and Billy knew\nthat she should not go to the telephone, nor summon Bertram.\n\nThe one fatal mistake now would be to let Bertram see her own distress.\nIf once he should suspect how she suffered in doing this thing, there\nwould be a scene that Billy felt she had not the courage to face. She\nmust, therefore, manage in some way not to see Bertram--not to let him\nsee her until she felt more sure of her self-control no matter what he\nsaid. The easiest way to do this was, of course, to go away. But where?\nHow? She must think. Meanwhile, for these first few hours, she would not\ntell any one, even Aunt Hannah, what had happened. There must _no one_\nspeak to her of it, yet. That she could not endure. Aunt Hannah would,\nof course, shiver, groan “Oh, my grief and conscience!” and call for\nanother shawl; and Billy just now felt as if she should scream if she\nheard Aunt Hannah say “Oh, my grief and conscience!”--over that. Billy\nwent down to breakfast, therefore, with a determination to act exactly\nas usual, so that Aunt Hannah should not know--yet.\n\nWhen people try to “act exactly as usual,” they generally end in acting\nquite the opposite; and Billy was no exception to the rule. Hence her\nattempted cheerfulness became flippantness, and her laughter giggles\nthat rang too frequently to be quite sincere--though from Aunt Hannah\nit all elicited only an affectionate smile at “the dear child's high\nspirits.”\n\nA little later, when Aunt Hannah was glancing over the morning\npaper--now no longer barred from the door--she gave a sudden cry.\n\n“Billy, just listen to this!” she exclaimed, reading from the paper in\nher hand. “'A new tenor in “The Girl of the Golden West.” Appearance\nof Mr. M. J. Arkwright at the Boston Opera House to-night. Owing to the\nsudden illness of Dubassi, who was to have taken the part of Johnson\ntonight, an exceptional opportunity has come to a young tenor singer,\none of the most promising pupils at the Conservatory school. Arkwright\nis said to have a fine voice, a particularly good stage presence, and\na purity of tone and smoothness of execution that few of his age and\nexperience can show. Only a short time ago he appeared as the duke at\none of the popular-priced Saturday night performances of “Rigoletto”;\nand his extraordinary success on that occasion, coupled with his\nfamiliarity with, and fitness for the part of Johnson in “The Girl\nof the Golden West,” led to his being chosen to take Dubassi's place\nto-night. His performance is awaited with the greatest of interest.' Now\nisn't that splendid for Mary Jane? I'm so glad!” beamed Aunt Hannah.\n\n“Of course we're glad!” cried Billy. “And didn't it come just in time?\nThis is the last week of opera, anyway, you know.”\n\n“But it says he sang before--on a Saturday night,” declared Aunt Hannah,\ngoing back to the paper in her hand. “Now wouldn't you have thought we'd\nhave heard of it, or read of it? And wouldn't you have thought he'd have\ntold us?”\n\n“Oh, well, maybe he didn't happen to see us so he could tell us,”\n returned Billy with elaborate carelessness.\n\n“I know it; but it's so funny he _hasn't_ seen us,” contended Aunt\nHannah, frowning. “You know how much he used to be here.”\n\nBilly colored, and hurried into the fray.\n\n“Oh, but he must have been so busy, with all this, you know. And of\ncourse we didn't see it in the paper--because we didn't have any paper\nat that time, probably. Oh, yes, that's my fault, I know,” she laughed;\n“and I was silly, I'll own. But we'll make up for it now. We'll go, of\ncourse, I wish it had been on our regular season-ticket night, but I\nfancy we can get seats somewhere; and I'm going to ask Alice Greggory\nand her mother, too. I'll go down there this morning to tell them, and\nto get the tickets. I've got it all planned.”\n\nBilly had, indeed, “got it all planned.” She had been longing for\nsomething that would take her away from the house--and if possible away\nfrom herself. This would do the one easily, and might help on the other.\nShe rose at once.\n\n“I'll go right away,” she said.\n\n“But, my dear,” frowned Aunt Hannah, anxiously, “I don't believe I can\ngo to-night--though I'd love to, dearly.”\n\n“But why not?”\n\n“I'm tired and half sick with a headache this morning. I didn't sleep,\nand I've taken cold somewhere,” sighed the lady, pulling the top shawl a\nlittle higher about her throat.\n\n“Why, you poor dear, what a shame!”\n\n“Won't Bertram go?” asked Aunt Hannah.\n\nBilly shook her head--but she did not meet Aunt Hannah's eyes.\n\n“Oh, no. I sha'n't even ask him. He said last night he had a banquet\non for to-night--one of his art clubs, I believe.” Billy's voice was\ncasualness itself.\n\n“But you'll have the Greggorys--that is, Mrs. Greggory _can_ go, can't\nshe?” inquired Aunt Hannah.\n\n“Oh, yes; I'm sure she can,” nodded Billy. “You know she went to the\noperetta, and this is just the same--only bigger.”\n\n“Yes, yes, I know,” murmured Aunt Hannah.\n\n“Dear me! How can she get about so on those two wretched little sticks?\nShe's a perfect marvel to me.”\n\n“She is to me, too,” sighed Billy, as she hurried from the room.\n\nBilly was, indeed, in a hurry. To herself she said she wanted to get\naway--away! And she got away as soon as she could.\n\nShe had her plans all made. She would go first to the Greggorys' and\ninvite them to attend the opera with her that evening. Then she would\nget the tickets. Just what she would do with the rest of the day she did\nnot know. She knew only that she would not go home until time to dress\nfor dinner and the opera. She did not tell Aunt Hannah this, however,\nwhen she left the house. She planned to telephone it from somewhere down\ntown, later. She told herself that she _could not_ stay all day under\nthe sharp eyes of Aunt Hannah--but she managed, nevertheless, to bid\nthat lady a particularly blithe and bright-faced good-by.\n\n\nBilly had not been long gone when the telephone bell rang. Aunt Hannah\nanswered it.\n\n“Why, Bertram, is that you?” she called, in answer to the words that\ncame to her across the wire. “Why, I hardly knew your voice!”\n\n“Didn't you? Well, is--is Billy there?”\n\n“No, she isn't. She's gone down to see Alice Greggory.”\n\n“Oh!” So evident was the disappointment in the voice that Aunt Hannah\nadded hastily:\n\n“I'm so sorry! She hasn't been gone ten minutes. But--is there any\nmessage?”\n\n“No, thank you. There's no--message.” The voice hesitated, then went on\na little constrainedly. “How--how is Billy this morning? She--she's all\nright, isn't she?”\n\nAunt Hannah laughed in obvious amusement.\n\n“Bless your dear heart, yes, my boy! Has it been such a _long_ time\nsince last evening--when you saw her yourself? Yes, she's all right. In\nfact, I was thinking at the breakfast table how pretty she looked with\nher pink cheeks and her bright eyes. She seemed to be in such high\nspirits.”\n\nAn inarticulate something that Aunt Hannah could not quite catch\ncame across the line; then a somewhat hurried “All right. Thank you.\nGood-by.”\n\nThe next time Aunt Hannah was called to the telephone, Billy spoke to\nher.\n\n“Aunt Hannah, don't wait luncheon for me, please. I shall get it in\ntown. And don't expect me till five o'clock. I have some shopping to\ndo.”\n\n“All right, dear,” replied Aunt Hannah. “Did you get the tickets?”\n\n“Yes, and the Greggorys will go. Oh, and Aunt Hannah!”\n\n“Yes, dear.”\n\n“Please tell John to bring Peggy around early enough to-night so we can\ngo down and get the Greggorys. I told them we'd call for them.”\n\n“Very well, dear. I'll tell him.”\n\n“Thank you. How's the poor head?”\n\n“Better, a little, I think.”\n\n“That's good. Won't you repent and go, too?”\n\n“No--oh, no, indeed!”\n\n“All right, then; good-by. I'm sorry!”\n\n“So'm I. Good-by,” sighed Aunt Hannah, as she hung up the receiver and\nturned away.\n\nIt was after five o'clock when Billy got home, and so hurried were the\ndressing and the dinner that Aunt Hannah forgot to mention Bertram's\ntelephone call till just as Billy was ready to start for the Greggorys'.\n\n“There! and I forgot,” she confessed. “Bertram called you up just after\nyou left this morning, my dear.”\n\n“Did he?” Billy's face was turned away, but Aunt Hannah did not notice\nthat.\n\n“Yes. Oh, he didn't want anything special,” smiled the lady,\n“only--well, he did ask if you were all right this morning,” she\nfinished with quiet mischief.\n\n“Did he?” murmured Billy again. This time there was a little sound after\nthe words, which Aunt Hannah would have taken for a sob if she had not\nknown that it must have been a laugh.\n\nThen Billy was gone.\n\nAt eight o'clock the doorbell rang, and a minute later Rosa came up\nto say that Mr. Bertram Henshaw was down-stairs and wished to see Mrs.\nStetson.\n\nMrs. Stetson went down at once.\n\n“Why, my dear boy,” she exclaimed, as she entered the room; “Billy said\nyou had a banquet on for to-night!”\n\n“Yes, I know; but--I didn't go.” Bertram's face was pale and drawn. His\nvoice did not sound natural.\n\n“Why, Bertram, you look ill! _Are_ you ill?” The man made an impatient\ngesture.\n\n“No, no, I'm not ill--I'm not ill at all. Rosa says--Billy's not here.”\n\n“No; she's gone to the opera with the Greggorys.”\n\n“The _opera!_” There was a grieved hurt in Bertram's voice that\nAunt Hannah quite misunderstood. She hastened to give an apologetic\nexplanation.\n\n“Yes. She would have told you--she would have asked you to join them,\nI'm sure, but she said you were going to a banquet. I'm _sure_ she said\nso.”\n\n“Yes, I did tell her so--last night,” nodded Bertram, dully.\n\nAunt Hannah frowned a little. Still more anxiously she endeavored to\nexplain to this disappointed lover why his sweetheart was not at home to\ngreet him.\n\n“Well, then, of course, my boy, she'd never think of your coming here\nto-night; and when she found Mr. Arkwright was going to sing--”\n\n“Arkwright!” There was no listlessness in Bertram's voice or manner now.\n\n“Yes. Didn't you see it in the paper? Such a splendid chance for him!\nHis picture was there, too.”\n\n“No. I didn't see it.”\n\n“Then you don't know about it, of course,” smiled Aunt Hannah. “But he's\nto take the part of Johnson in 'The Girl of the Golden West.' Isn't that\nsplendid? I'm so glad! And Billy was, too. She hurried right off this\nmorning to get the tickets and to ask the Greggorys.”\n\n“Oh!” Bertram got to his feet a little abruptly, and held out his hand.\n“Well, then, I might as well say good-by then, I suppose,” he suggested\nwith a laugh that Aunt Hannah thought was a bit forced. Before she could\nremind him again, though, that Billy was really not to blame for not\nbeing there to welcome him, he was gone. And Aunt Hannah could only go\nup-stairs and meditate on the unreasonableness of lovers in general, and\nof Bertram in particular.\n\nAunt Hannah had gone to bed, but she was still awake, when Billy came\nhome, so she heard the automobile come to a stop before the door, and\nshe called to Billy when the girl came upstairs.\n\n“Billy, dear, come in here. I'm awake! I want to hear about it. Was it\ngood?”\n\nBilly stopped in the doorway. The light from the hall struck her face.\nThere was no brightness in her eyes now, no pink in her cheeks.\n\n“Oh, yes, it was good--very good,” she replied listlessly.\n\n“Why, Billy, how queer you answer! What was the matter? Wasn't Mary\nJane--all right?”\n\n“Mary Jane? Oh!--oh, yes; he was very good, Aunt Hannah.”\n\n“'Very good,' indeed!” echoed the lady, indignantly. “He must have\nbeen!--when you speak as if you'd actually forgotten that he sang at\nall, anyway!”\n\nBilly had forgotten--almost. Billy had found that, in spite of her\ngetting away from the house, she had not got away from herself once, all\nday. She tried now, however, to summon her acting powers of the morning.\n\n“But it was splendid, really, Aunt Hannah,” she cried, with some show\nof animation. “And they clapped and cheered and gave him any number of\ncurtain calls. We were so proud of him! But you see, I _am_ tired,” she\nbroke off wearily.\n\n“You poor child, of course you are, and you look like a ghost! I won't\nkeep you another minute. Run along to bed. Oh--Bertram didn't go to that\nbanquet, after all. He came here,” she added, as Billy turned to go.\n\n“Bertram!” The girl wheeled sharply.\n\n“Yes. He wanted you, of course. I found I didn't do, at all,” chuckled\nAunt Hannah. “Did you suppose I would?”\n\nThere was no answer. Billy had gone.\n\n\nIn the long night watches Billy fought it out with herself. (Billy had\nalways fought things out with herself.) She must go away. She knew that.\nAlready Bertram had telephoned, and called. He evidently meant to see\nher--and she could not see him. She dared not. If she did--Billy knew\nnow how pitifully little it would take to make her actually _willing_ to\nslay Bertram's Art, stifle his Ambition, destroy his Inspiration, and be\na nuisance generally--if only she could have Bertram while she was doing\nit all. Sternly then she asked herself if she had no pride; if she had\nforgotten that it was because of her that the Winthrop portrait had not\nbeen a success--because of her, either for the reason that he loved now\nMiss Winthrop, or else that he loved no girl--except to paint.\n\nVery early in the morning a white-faced, red-eyed Billy appeared at Aunt\nHannah's bedside.\n\n“Billy!” exclaimed Aunt Hannah, plainly appalled.\n\nBilly sat down on the edge of the bed.\n\n“Aunt Hannah,” she began in a monotonous voice as if she were reciting\na lesson she had learned by heart, “please listen, and please try not to\nbe too surprised. You were saying the other day that you would like to\nvisit your old home town. Well, I think that's a very nice idea. If you\ndon't mind we'll go to-day.”\n\nAunt Hannah pulled herself half erect in bed.\n\n“_To-day_--child?”\n\n“Yes,” nodded Billy, unsmilingly. “We shall have to go somewhere to-day,\nand I thought you would like that place best.”\n\n“But--Billy!--what does this mean?”\n\nBilly sighed heavily.\n\n“Yes, I understand. You'll have to know the rest, of course. I've broken\nmy engagement. I don't want to see Bertram. That's why I'm going away.”\n\nAunt Hannah fell nervelessly back on the pillow. Her teeth fairly\nchattered.\n\n“Oh, my grief and conscience--_Billy!_ Won't you please pull up that\nblanket,” she moaned. “Billy, what do you mean?”\n\nBilly shook her head and got to her feet.\n\n“I can't tell any more now, really, Aunt Hannah. Please don't ask me;\nand don't--talk. You _will_--go with me, won't you?” And Aunt Hannah,\nwith her terrified eyes on Billy's piteously agitated face, nodded her\nhead and choked:\n\n“Why, of course I'll go--anywhere--with you, Billy; but--why did you do\nit, why did you do it?”\n\nA little later, Billy, in her own room, wrote this note to Bertram:\n\n\n     “DEAR BERTRAM:--I'm going away to-day.\n     That'll be best all around. You'll agree to that,\n     I'm sure. Please don't try to see me, and please\n     don't write. It wouldn't make either one of us\n     any happier. You must know that.\n\n             “As ever your friend,\n\n                    “BILLY.”\n\n\nBertram, when he read it, grew only a shade more white, a degree more\nsick at heart. Then he kissed the letter gently and put it away with the\nother.\n\nTo Bertram, the thing was very clear. Billy had come now to the\nconclusion that it would be wrong to give herself where she could not\ngive her heart. And in this he agreed with her--bitter as it was for\nhim. Certainly he did not want Billy, if Billy did not want him, he told\nhimself. He would now, of course, accede to her request. He would not\nwrite to her--and make her suffer more. But to Bertram, at that moment,\nit seemed that the very sun in the heavens had gone out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII. PETE TO THE RESCUE\n\n\nOne by one the weeks passed and became a month. Then other weeks became\nother months. It was July when Billy, homesick and weary, came back to\nHillside with Aunt Hannah.\n\nHome looked wonderfully good to Billy, in spite of the fact that she had\nso dreaded to see it. Billy had made up her mind, however, that, come\nsometime she must. She could not, of course, stay always away. Perhaps,\ntoo, it would be just as easy at home as it was away. Certainly it could\nnot be any harder. She was convinced of that. Besides, she did not want\nBertram to think--\n\nBilly had received only meagre news from Boston since she went away.\nBertram had not written at all. William had written twice--hurt,\ngrieved, puzzled, questioning letters that were very hard to answer.\nFrom Marie, too, had come letters of much the same sort. By far the\ncheeriest epistles had come from Alice Greggory. They contained, indeed,\nabout the only comfort Billy had known for weeks, for they showed very\nplainly to Billy that Arkwright's heart had been caught on the rebound;\nand that in Alice Greggory he was finding the sweetest sort of balm for\nhis wounded feelings. From these letters Billy learned, too, that Judge\nGreggory's honor had been wholly vindicated; and, as Billy told Aunt\nHannah, “anybody could put two and two together and make four, now.”\n\nIt was eight o'clock on a rainy July evening that Billy and Aunt Hannah\narrived at Hillside; and it was only a little past eight that Aunt\nHannah was summoned to the telephone. When she came back to Billy she\nwas crying and wringing her hands.\n\nBilly sprang to her feet.\n\n“Why, Aunt Hannah, what is it? What's the matter?” she demanded.\n\nAunt Hannah sank into a chair, still wringing her hands.\n\n“Oh, Billy, Billy, how can I tell you, how can I tell you?” she moaned.\n\n“You must tell me! Aunt Hannah, what is it?”\n\n“Oh--oh--oh! Billy, I can't--I can't!”\n\n“But you'll have to! What is it, Aunt Hannah?”\n\n“It's--B-Bertram!”\n\n“Bertram!” Billy's face grew ashen. “Quick, quick--what do you mean?”\n\nFor answer, Aunt Hannah covered her face with her hands and began to sob\naloud. Billy, almost beside herself now with terror and anxiety, dropped\non her knees and tried to pull away the shaking hands.\n\n“Aunt Hannah, you must tell me! You must--you must!”\n\n“I can't, Billy. It's Bertram. He's--_hurt!_” choked Aunt Hannah,\nhysterically.\n\n“Hurt! How?”\n\n“I don't know. Pete told me.”\n\n“Pete!”\n\n“Yes. Rosa had told him we were coming, and he called me up. He said\nmaybe I could do something. So he told me.”\n\n“Yes, yes! But told you what?”\n\n“That he was hurt.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“I couldn't hear all, but I think 'twas an accident--automobile. And,\nBilly, Billy--Pete says it's his arm--his right arm--and that maybe he\ncan't ever p-paint again!”\n\n“Oh-h!” Billy fell back as if the words had been a blow. “Not that, Aunt\nHannah--not that!”\n\n“That's what Pete said. I couldn't get all of it, but I got that.\nAnd, Billy, he's been out of his head--though he isn't now, Pete\nsays--and--and--and he's been calling for you.”\n\n“For--_me?_” A swift change came to Billy's face.\n\n“Yes. Over and over again he called for you--while he was crazy, you\nknow. That's why Pete told me. He said he didn't rightly understand what\nthe trouble was, but he didn't believe there was any trouble, _really_,\nbetween you two; anyway, that you wouldn't think there was, if you could\nhear him, and know how he wanted you, and--why, Billy!”\n\nBilly was on her feet now. Her fingers were on the electric push-button\nthat would summon Rosa. Her face was illumined. The next moment Rosa\nappeared.\n\n“Tell John to bring Peggy to the door at once, please,” directed her\nmistress.\n\n“Billy!” gasped Aunt Hannah again, as the maid disappeared. Billy was\ntremblingly putting on the hat she had but just taken off. “Billy, what\nare you going to do?”\n\nBilly turned in obvious surprise.\n\n“Why, I'm going to Bertram, of course.”\n\n“To Bertram! But it's nearly half-past eight, child, and it rains, and\neverything!”\n\n“But Bertram _wants_ me!” exclaimed Billy. “As if I'd mind rain, or\ntime, or anything else, _now!_”\n\n“But--but--oh, my grief and conscience!” groaned Aunt Hannah, beginning\nto wring her hands again.\n\nBilly reached for her coat. Aunt Hannah stirred into sudden action.\n\n“But, Billy, if you'd only wait till to-morrow,” she quavered, putting\nout a feebly restraining hand.\n\n“To-morrow!” The young voice rang with supreme scorn. “Do you think I'd\nwait till to-morrow--after all this? I say Bertram _wants_ me.” Billy\npicked up her gloves.\n\n“But you broke it off, dear--you said you did; and to go down there\nto-night--like this--”\n\nBilly lifted her head. Her eyes shone. Her whole face was a glory of\nlove and pride.\n\n“That was before. I didn't know. He _wants_ me, Aunt Hannah. Did\nyou hear? He _wants_ me! And now I won't even--hinder him, if he\ncan't--p-paint again!” Billy's voice broke. The glory left her face. Her\neyes brimmed with tears, but her head was still bravely uplifted. “I'm\ngoing to Bertram!”\n\nBlindly Aunt Hannah got to her feet. Still more blindly she reached for\nher bonnet and cloak on the chair near her.\n\n“Oh, will you go, too?” asked Billy, abstractedly, hurrying to the\nwindow to look for the motor car.\n\n“Will I go, too!” burst out Aunt Hannah's indignant voice. “Do you think\nI'd let you go alone, and at this time of night, on such a wild-goose\nchase as this?”\n\n“I don't know, I'm sure,” murmured Billy, still abstractedly, peering\nout into the rain.\n\n“Don't know, indeed! Oh, my grief and conscience!” groaned Aunt Hannah,\nsetting her bonnet hopelessly askew on top of her agitated head.\n\nBut Billy did not even answer now. Her face was pressed hard against the\nwindow-pane.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII. BERTRAM TAKES THE REINS\n\n\nWith stiffly pompous dignity Pete opened the door. The next moment\nhe fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starry-eyed,\nflushed-cheeked young woman who demanded:\n\n“Where is he, Pete?”\n\n“Miss Billy!” gasped the old man. Then he saw Aunt Hannah--Aunt Hannah\nwith her bonnet askew, her neck-bow awry, one hand bare, and the other\nhalf covered with a glove wrong side out. Aunt Hannah's cheeks, too,\nwere flushed, and her eyes starry, but with dismay and anger--the last\nbecause she did not like the way Pete had said Miss Billy's name. It was\none matter for her to object to this thing Billy was doing--but quite\nanother for Pete to do it.\n\n“Of course it's she!” retorted Aunt Hannah, testily. “As if you yourself\ndidn't bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night!”\n\n“Pete, where is he?” interposed Billy. “Tell Mr. Bertram I am here--or,\nwait! I'll go right in and surprise him.”\n\n“_Billy!_” This time it was Aunt Hannah who gasped her name.\n\nPete had recovered himself by now, but he did not even glance toward\nAunt Hannah. His face was beaming, and his old eyes were shining.\n\n“Miss Billy, Miss Billy, you're an angel straight from heaven, you\nare--you are! Oh, I'm so glad you came! It'll be all right now--all\nright! He's in the den, Miss Billy.”\n\nBilly turned eagerly, but before she could take so much as one step\ntoward the door at the end of the hall, Aunt Hannah's indignant voice\narrested her.\n\n“Billy-stop! You're not an angel; you're a young woman--and a crazy\none, at that! Whatever angels do, young women don't go unannounced and\nunchaperoned into young men's rooms! Pete, go tell your master that _we_\nare here, and ask if he will receive _us_.”\n\nPete's lips twitched. The emphatic “we” and “us” were not lost on him.\nBut his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke.\n\n“Mr. Bertram is up and dressed, ma'am. He's in the den. I'll speak to\nhim.”\n\nPete, once again the punctilious butler, stalked to the door of\nBertram's den and threw it wide open.\n\nOpposite the door, on a low couch, lay Bertram, his head bandaged, and\nhis right arm in a sling. His face was turned toward the door, but his\neyes were closed. He looked very white, and his features were pitifully\ndrawn with suffering.\n\n“Mr. Bertram,” began Pete--but he got no further. A flying figure\nbrushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch, with a low cry.\n\nBertram's eyes flew open. Across his face swept such a radiant look of\nunearthly joy that Pete sobbed audibly and fled to the kitchen. Dong\nLing found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with\na fringed napkin that had been spread over Bertram's tray. In the hall\nabove Aunt Hannah was crying into William's gray linen duster that hung\non the hall-rack--Aunt Hannah's handkerchief was on the floor back at\nHillside.\n\nIn the den neither Billy nor Bertram knew or cared what had become of\nAunt Hannah and Pete. There were just two people in their world--two\npeople, and unutterable, incredible, overwhelming rapture and peace.\nThen, very gradually it dawned over them that there was, after all,\nsomething strange and unexplained in it all.\n\n“But, dearest, what does it mean--you here like this?” asked Bertram\nthen. As if to make sure that she was “here, like this,” he drew her\neven closer--Bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was\nusable.\n\nBilly, on her knees by the couch, snuggled into the curve of the one arm\nwith a contented little sigh.\n\n“Well, you see, just as soon as I found out to-night that you wanted me,\nI came,” she said.\n\n“You darling! That was--” Bertram stopped suddenly. A puzzled frown\nshowed below the fantastic bandage about his head. “'As soon as,'” he\nquoted then scornfully. “Were you ever by any possible chance thinking I\n_didn't_ want you?”\n\nBilly's eyes widened a little.\n\n“Why, Bertram, dear, don't you see? When you were so troubled that\nthe picture didn't go well, and I found out it was about me you were\ntroubled--I--”\n\n“Well?” Bertram's voice was a little strained.\n\n“Why, of--of course,” stammered Billy, “I couldn't help thinking that\nmaybe you had found out you _didn't_ want me.”\n\n“_Didn't want you!_” groaned Bertram, his tense muscles relaxing. “May I\nask why?”\n\nBilly blushed.\n\n“I wasn't quite sure why,” she faltered; “only, of course, I thought\nof--of Miss Winthrop, you know, or that maybe it was because you didn't\ncare for _any_ girl, only to paint--oh, oh, Bertram! Pete told us,” she\nbroke off wildly, beginning to sob.\n\n“Pete told you that I didn't care for any girl, only to paint?” demanded\nBertram, angry and mystified.\n\n“No, no,” sobbed Billy, “not that. It was all the others that told\nme that! Pete told Aunt Hannah about the accident, you know, and he\nsaid--he said--Oh, Bertram, I _can't_ say it! But that's one of the\nthings that made me know I _could_ come now, you see, because I--I\nwouldn't hinder you, nor slay your Art, nor any other of those dreadful\nthings if--if you couldn't ever--p-paint again,” finished Billy in an\nuncontrollable burst of grief.\n\n“There, there, dear,” comforted Bertram, patting the bronze-gold head\non his breast. “I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking\nabout--except the last; but I know there _can't_ be anything that ought\nto make you cry like that. As for my not painting again--you didn't\nunderstand Pete, dearie. That was what they were afraid of at\nfirst--that I'd lose my arm; but that danger is all past now. I'm\nloads better. Of course I'm going to paint again--and better than ever\nbefore--_now!_”\n\nBilly lifted her head. A look that was almost terror came to her eyes.\nShe pulled herself half away from Bertram's encircling arm.\n\n“Why, Billy,” cried the man, in pained surprise. “You don't mean to say\nyou're _sorry_ I'm going to paint again!”\n\n“No, no! Oh, no, Bertram--never that!” she faltered, still regarding\nhim with fearful eyes. “It's only--for _me_, you know. I _can't_ go back\nnow, and not have you--after this!--even if I do hinder you, and--”\n\n“_Hinder me!_ What are you talking about, Billy?”\n\nBilly drew a quivering sigh.\n\n“Well, to begin with, Kate said--”\n\n“Good heavens! Is Kate in _this_, too?” Bertram's voice was savage now.\n\n“Well, she wrote a letter.”\n\n“I'll warrant she did! Great Scott, Billy! Don't you know Kate by this\ntime?”\n\n“Y-yes, I said so, too. But, Bertram, what she wrote was true. I found\nit everywhere, afterwards--in magazines and papers, and even in Marie.”\n\n“Humph! Well, dearie, I don't know yet what you found, but I do know you\nwouldn't have found it at all if it hadn't been for Kate--and I wish I\nhad her here this minute!”\n\nBilly giggled hysterically.\n\n“I don't--not _right_ here,” she cooed, nestling comfortably against\nher lover's arm. “But you see, dear, she never _has_ approved of the\nmarriage.”\n\n“Well, who's doing the marrying--she, or I?” “That's what I said,\ntoo--only in another way,” sighed Billy. “But she called us flyaway\nflutterbudgets, and she said I'd ruin your career, if I did marry you.”\n\n“Well, I can tell you right now, Billy, you will ruin it if you don't!”\n declared Bertram. “That's what ailed me all the time I was painting that\nmiserable portrait. I was so worried--for fear I'd lose you.”\n\n“Lose me! Why, Bertram Henshaw, what do you mean?”\n\nA shamed red crept to the man's forehead.\n\n“Well, I suppose I might as well own up now as any time. I was scared\nblue, Billy, with jealousy of--Arkwright.”\n\nBilly laughed gayly--but she shifted her position and did not meet her\nlover's eyes.\n\n“Arkwright? Nonsense!” she cried. “Why, he's going to marry Alice\nGreggory. I know he is! I can see it as plain as day in her letters.\nHe's there a lot.”\n\n“And you never did think for a minute, Billy, that you cared for him?”\n Bertram's gaze searched Billy's face a little fearfully. He had not been\nslow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids. But Billy looked him\nnow straight in the face--it was a level, frank gaze of absolute truth.\n\n“Never, dear,” she said firmly. (Billy was so glad Bertram had turned\nthe question on _her_ love instead of Arkwright's!) “There has never\nreally been any one but you.”\n\n“Thank God for that,” breathed Bertram, as he drew the bright head\nnearer and held it close.\n\nAfter a minute Billy stirred and sighed happily.\n\n“Aren't lovers the beat'em for imagining things?” she murmured.\n\n“They certainly are.”\n\n“You see--I wasn't in love with Mr. Arkwright.”\n\n“I see--I hope.”\n\n“And--and you didn't care _specially_ for--for Miss Winthrop?”\n\n“Eh? Well, no!” exploded Bertram. “Do you mean to say you really--”\n\nBilly put a soft finger on his lips.\n\n“Er--'people who live in _glass houses_,' you know,” she reminded him,\nwith roguish eyes.\n\nBertram kissed the finger and subsided.\n\n“Humph!” he commented.\n\nThere was a long silence; then, a little breathlessly, Billy asked:\n\n“And you don't--after all, love me--just to paint?”\n\n“Well, what is that? Is that Kate, too?” demanded Bertram, grimly.\n\nBilly laughed.\n\n“No--oh, she said it, all right, but, you see, _everybody_ said that to\nme, Bertram; and that's what made me so--so worried sometimes when you\ntalked about the tilt of my chin, and all that.”\n\n“Well, by Jove!” breathed Bertram.\n\nThere was another silence. Then, suddenly, Bertram stirred.\n\n“Billy, I'm going to marry you to-morrow,” he announced decisively.\n\nBilly lifted her head and sat back in palpitating dismay.\n\n“Bertram! What an absurd idea!”\n\n“Well, I am. I don't _know_ as I can trust you out of my sight till\n_then!_ You'll read something, or hear something, or get a letter from\nKate after breakfast to-morrow morning, that will set you 'saving me'\nagain; and I don't want to be saved--that way. I'm going to marry you\nto-morrow. I'll get--” He stopped short, with a sudden frown. “Confound\nthat law! I forgot. Great Scott, Billy, I'll have to trust you five\ndays, after all! There's a new law about the license. We've _got_ to\nwait five days--and maybe more, counting in the notice, and all.”\n\nBilly laughed softly.\n\n“Five days, indeed, sir! I wonder if you think I can get ready to be\nmarried in five days.”\n\n\n“Don't want you to get ready,” retorted Bertram, promptly. “I saw Marie\nget ready, and I had all I wanted of it. If you really must have all\nthose miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace rufflings\nwe'll do it afterwards,--not before.”\n\n“But--”\n\n“Besides, I _need_ you to take care of me,” cut in Bertram, craftily.\n\n“Bertram, do you--really?”\n\nThe tender glow on Billy's face told its own story, and Bertram's eager\neyes were not slow to read it.\n\n“Sweetheart, see here, dear,” he cried softly, tightening his good left\narm. And forthwith he began to tell her how much he did, indeed, need\nher.\n\n\n“Billy, my dear!” It was Aunt Hannah's plaintive voice at the doorway,\na little later. “We must go home; and William is here, too, and wants to\nsee you.”\n\nBilly rose at once as Aunt Hannah entered the room.\n\n“Yes, Aunt Hannah, I'll come; besides”--she glanced at Bertram\nmischievously--“I shall need all the time I've got to prepare for--my\nwedding.”\n\n“Your wedding! You mean it'll be before--October?” Aunt Hannah glanced\nfrom one to the other uncertainly. Something in their smiling faces sent\na quick suspicion to her eyes.\n\n“Yes,” nodded Billy, demurely. “It's next Tuesday, you see.”\n\n“Next Tuesday! But that's only a week away,” gasped Aunt Hannah.\n\n“Yes, a week.”\n\n“But, child, your trousseau--the wedding--the--the--a week!” Aunt Hannah\ncould not articulate further.\n\n“Yes, I know; that is a good while,” cut in Bertram, airily. “We wanted\nit to-morrow, but we had to wait, on account of the new license law.\nOtherwise it wouldn't have been so long, and--”\n\nBut Aunt Hannah was gone. With a low-breathed “Long! Oh, my grief and\nconscience--_William!_” she had fled through the hall door.\n\n“Well, it _is_ long,” maintained Bertram, with tender eyes, as he\nreached out his hand to say good-night.",
