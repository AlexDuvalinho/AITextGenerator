THE LOVE OF ANTELOPE\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nUpon a hanging precipice atop of the Eagle Scout Butte there appeared a\nmotionless and solitary figure--almost eagle-like he perched! The people\nin the camp below saw him, but none looked at him long. They turned\ntheir heads quickly away with a nervous tingling, for the height above\nthe plains was great. Almost spirit-like among the upper clouds the\nyoung warrior sat immovable.\n\nIt was Antelope. He was fasting and seeking a sign from the “Great\nMystery,” for such was the first step of the young and ambitious Sioux\n[who wished to be a noted warrior among his people].\n\nHe is a princely youth, among the wild Sioux, who hunts for his tribe\nand not for himself! His voice is soft and low at the campfire of his\nnation, but terror-giving in the field of battle. Such was Antelope’s\nreputation. The more he sought the “Great Mystery” in solitude, the more\ngentle and retiring he became, and in the same proportion his courage\nand manliness grew. None could say that he was not a kind son and a good\nhunter, for he had already passed the “two-arrow-to-kill,” his buffalo\nexamination.\n\nOn a hot midsummer morning a few weeks later, while most of the inmates\nof the teepees were breakfasting in the open air, the powerful voice of\nthe herald resounded among the pine-clad heights and green valleys.\n\n“Hear ye, hear ye, warriors!” he chanted loudly. “The council has\ndecreed that four brave young men must scout the country to the\nsunsetward of the camp, for the peace and protection of our people!”\n\nAll listened eagerly for the names of the chosen warriors, and in\nanother moment there came the sonorous call: “Antelope, Antelope! the\ncouncil has selected you!”\n\nThe camp was large--fully four hundred paces across; but in that\ncountry, in the clear morning air, such an announcement can be heard a\ngreat way, and in the silence that followed the hills repeated over and\nover the musical name of Antelope.\n\nIn due time the four chosen youths appeared before the council fire.\nThe oath of the pipe was administered, and each took a few whiffs as\nreverently as a Churchman would partake of the sacrament. The chief of\nthe council, who was old and of a striking appearance, gave the charge\nand command to the youthful braves.\n\nThere was a score or more of warriors ready mounted to escort them\nbeyond the precincts of the camp, and the “fearless heart” song was sung\naccording to the custom, as the four ran lightly from the door of the\ncouncil teepee and disappeared in the woods.\n\nIt was a peculiarly trying and hazardous moment in which to perform\nthe duties of a scout. The Sioux were encroaching upon the territory of\nhostile tribes, here in the foot-hills of the Big Horn Mountains, and\nnow and then one of their hunters was cut off by the enemy. If continual\nvigilance could not save them, it might soon become necessary to retreat\nto their own hunting-grounds.\n\nIt was a savage fetish that a warrior must be proof against the alluring\nways of pretty maidens; that he must place his honor far above the\ntemptations of self-indulgence and indolence. Cold, hunger, and personal\nhardship did not count with Antelope when there was required of him\nany special exertion for the common good. It was cause to him of secret\nsatisfaction that the council-men had selected him for a dangerous\nservice in preference to some of his rivals and comrades.\n\nHe had been running for two or three hours at a good, even gait, and had\ncrossed more than one of the smaller creeks, yet many deep gulches and\nbad lands lay between him and the furthest peak that melted into the\nblue dome above.\n\n“I shall stand upon the Bear’s Heart,” he said to himself. “If I can\ndo that, and still report before the others, I shall do well!” His keen\neyes were constantly sweeping the country in his front, and suddenly\nhe paused and shrank back motionless in a crouching attitude, still\nsteadily keeping an eye upon a moving object. It was soon evident\nthat some one was stealthily eying him from behind cover, and he was\noutwitted by the enemy! Still stooping, he glided down a little ravine,\nand as he reached the bed of the creek there emerged from it a large\ngray wolf.\n\nThis was very opportune for Antelope. He gave the gray wolf’s\ndanger-call with all his might; waited an instant and gave it a second\ntime; then he turned and ran fleetly down the stream. At the same moment\nthe wolf appeared upon the top of the bank, in full view of the enemy.\n\n“Here he comes!” they whispered, and had their arrows on the string as\nthe wolf trotted leisurely along, exposing only his head, for this was a\ncommon disguise among the plains Indians. But when he came out into the\nopen, behold! it was only a gray wolf!\n\n“Ugh!” the Utes grunted, as they looked at each other in much chagrin.\n\n“Surely he was a man, and coming directly into our trap! We sang and\nprayed to the gods of war when our war chief sent us ahead to scout the\nSioux people, to find their camp. This is a mystery, a magic! Either he\nis a Sioux in disguise, or we don’t know their tricks!” exclaimed the\nleader.\n\nNow they gave the war-whoop, and their arrows flew through the air. The\nwolf gave a yelp of distress, staggered and fell dead. Instantly they\nran to examine the body, and found it to be truly that of a wolf.\n\n“Either this is a wonderful medicine-man, or we are shamefully fooled by\na Sioux warrior,” they muttered.\n\nThey lost several minutes before they caught sight of Antelope, who had\nfollowed the bed of the creek as far as it lay in his direction and then\ncame out of it at full speed. It would be safer for him to remain in\nconcealment until dark; but in the meantime the Ute warriors would reach\nthe camp, and his people were unprepared! It was necessary to expose\nhimself to the enemy. He knew that it would be chiefly a contest of\nspeed and he had an excellent start; but on the other hand, the Utes\ndoubtless had their horses.\n\n“The Sioux who played this trick on us must die to-day!” exclaimed their\nleader. “Come, friends, we cannot afford to let him tell this joke on us\nat the camp-fires of his people!”\n\nAntelope was headed directly for Eagle Scout Butte, for the camp was in\nplain view from the top of this hill. He had run pretty much all day,\nbut then, that was nothing!\n\n“I shall reach the summit first, unless the Ute horses have wings!” he\nsaid to himself.\n\nLooking over his shoulder, he saw five horsemen approaching, so he\nexamined his bow and arrows as he ran.\n\n“All is well,” he muttered. “One of their spirits at the least must\nguide mine to the spirit land!” where, it was believed by them, there\nwas no fighting.\n\nNow he was within hearing of their whoops, but he was already at the\nfoot of the butte. Their horses could not run up the steep ascent, and\nthey were obliged to dismount. Like a deer the Sioux leaped from rock\nto rock, and almost within arrow-shot came his pursuers, wildly whooping\nand yelling.\n\nWhen he had achieved the summit, he took his stand between two great\nrocks, and flashed his tiny looking-glass for a distress signal into the\ndistant camp of his people.\n\nFor a long time no reply came, and many arrows flew over his head, as\nthe Utes approached gradually from rock to rock. He, too, sent down a\nswift arrow now and then, to show them that he was no child or woman in\nfight, but brave as a bear when it is brought to bay.\n\n“Ho, ho!” he shouted to the enemy, in token of a brave man’s welcome to\ndanger and death.\n\nThey replied with yells of triumph, as they pressed more and more\nclosely upon him. One of their number had been dispatched to notify the\nmain war-party when they first saw Antelope, but he did not know this,\nand his courage was undiminished. From time to time he continued to\nflash his signal, and at last like lightning the little white flash came\nin reply.\n\nThe sun was low when the besieged warrior discovered a large body of\nhorsemen approaching from the northwest. It was the Ute warparty! He\nlooked earnestly once more toward the Sioux camp, shading his eyes with\nhis right palm. There, too, were many moving specks upon the plain,\ndrawing toward the foot of the hill!\n\nAt the middle of the afternoon they had caught his distress signal, and\nthe entire camp was thrown into confusion, for but few of the men had\nreturned from the daily hunt. As fast as they came in, the warriors\nhurried away upon their best horses, singing and yelling. When they\nreached the well-known butte, towering abruptly in the midst of the\nplain, they could distinguish their enemies massed behind the hanging\nrocks and scattered cedar-trees, crawling up closer and closer, for the\nlarge warparty reached the hill just as the scouts who held Antelope at\nbay discovered the approach of his kinsmen.\n\nAntelope had long since exhausted his quiver of arrows and was gathering\nup many of those that fell about him to send them back among his\npursuers. When their attention was withdrawn from him for an instant by\nthe sudden onset of the Sioux, he sprang to his feet.\n\nHe raised both his hands heavenward in token of gratitude for his\nrescue, and his friends announced with loud shouts the daring of\nAntelope.\n\nBoth sides fought bravely, but the Utes at last retreated and were\nfiercely pursued. Antelope stood at his full height upon the huge rock\nthat had sheltered him, and gave his yell of defiance and exultation.\nBelow him the warriors took it up, and among the gathering shadows the\nrocks echoed praises of his name.\n\nIn the Sioux camp upon Lost Water there were dances and praise songs,\nbut there was wailing and mourning, too, for many lay dead among the\ncrags. The name of Antelope was indelibly recorded upon Eagle Scout\nButte.\n\n“If he wished for a war-bonnet of eagle feathers, it is his to wear,”\n declared one of the young men. “But he is modest, and scarcely even\njoins in the scalp dances. It is said of him that he has never yet\nspoken to any young woman!”\n\n“True, it is not announced publicly that he has addressed a maiden. Many\nparents would like to have their daughters the first one he would speak\nto, but I am told he desires to go upon one or two more war-paths before\nseeking woman’s company,” replied another.\n\n“Hun, hun, hay!” exclaimed a third youth ill-naturedly. He is already\nold enough to be a father!”\n\n“This is told of him,” rejoined the first speaker. “He wants to hold\nthe record of being the young man who made the greatest number of coups\nbefore he spoke to a maiden. I know that there are not only mothers who\nwould be glad to have him for a son-in-law, but their young daughters\nwould not refuse to look upon the brave Antelope as a husband!”\n\nIt was true that in the dance his name was often mentioned, and at every\nrepetition it seemed that the young women danced with more spirit, while\neven grandmothers joined in the whirl with a show of youthful abandon.\n\nWezee, the father of Antelope, was receiving congratulations throughout\nthe afternoon. Many of the old men came to his lodge to smoke with him,\nand the host was more than gratified, for he was of a common family and\nhad never before known what it is to bask in the sunshine of popularity\nand distinction. He spoke complacently as he crowded a handful of\ntobacco into the bowl of the long red pipe.\n\n“Friends, our life here is short, and the life of a brave youth is apt\nto be shorter than most! We crave all the happiness that we can get, and\nit is right that we should do so. One who says that he does not care\nfor reputation or success, is not likely to be telling the truth. So you\nwill forgive me if I say too much about the honorable career of my son.”\n This was the old man’s philosophic apology.\n\n“Ho, ho,” his guests graciously responded. “It is your moon! Every moon\nhas its fullness, when it lights up the night, while the little stars\ndance before it. So to every man there comes his full moon!”\n\nSomewhat later in the day all the young people of the great camp were\nseen to be moving in one direction. All wore their best attire and\nfinest ornaments, and even the parti-colored steeds were decorated to\nthe satisfaction of their beauty-loving riders.\n\n“Ugh, Taluta is making a maidens’ feast! She, the prettiest of all the\nUnkpapa maidens!” exclaimed one of the young braves.\n\n“She, the handsomest of all our young women!” repeated another.\n\nTaluta was indeed a handsome maid in the height and bloom of womanhood,\nwith all that wonderful freshness and magnetism which was developed\nand preserved by the life of the wilderness. She had already given five\nmaidens’ feasts, beginning with her fifteenth year, and her shy and\ndiffident purity was held sacred by her people.\n\nThe maidens’ circle was now complete. Behind it the outer circle of old\nwomen was equally picturesque and even more dignified. The grandmother,\nnot the mother, was regarded as the natural protector of the young\nmaiden, and the dowagers derived much honor from their position,\nespecially upon public occasions, taking to themselves no small amount\nof credit for the good reputations of their charges.\n\nWeshawee, whose protege had many suitors and was a decided coquette,\nfidgeted nervously and frequently adjusted her robe or fingered\nher necklace to ease her mind, for she dreaded lest, in spite of\nwatchfulness, some mishap might have befallen her charge. Her anxiety\nwas apparently shared by several other chaperons who stole occasional\nsuspicious glances in the direction of certain of the young braves.\nIt had been known to happen that a girl unworthy to join in the sacred\nfeast was publicly disgraced.\n\nA special police force was appointed to keep order on this occasion,\neach member of which was gorgeously painted and bedecked with eagle\nfeathers, and carried in his hand a long switch with which to threaten\nthe encroaching throng. Their horses wore head-skins of fierce animals\nto add to their awe-inspiring appearance.\n\nThe wild youths formed the outer circle of the gathering, attired like\nthe woods in autumn, their long locks glossy with oil and perfumed with\nscented grass and leaves. Many pulled their blankets over their heads as\nif to avoid recognition, and loitered shyly at a distance.\n\nAmong these last were Antelope and his cousin, Red Eagle. They stood\nin the angle formed by the bodies of their steeds, whose noses were\ntogether. The young hero was completely enveloped in his handsome robe\nwith a rainbow of bead-work acros the middle, and his small moccasined\nfeet projected from beneath the lower border. Red Eagle held up an\neagle-wing fan, partially concealing his face, and both gazed intently\ntoward the center of the maidens’ circle.\n\n“Woo! woo!” was the sonorous exclamation of the police, announcing the\nbeginning of the ceremonies. In the midst of the ring of girls stood the\ntraditional heart-shaped red stone, with its bristling hedge of arrows.\nIn this case there were five arrows, indicating that Taluta had already\nmade as many maidens’ feasts. Each of the maidens must lay her hand upon\nthe stone in token of her purity and chastity, touching also as many\narrows as she herself has attended maidens’ feasts.\n\nTaluta advanced first to the center. As she stood for a moment beside\nthe sacred stone, she appeared to the gazing bystanders the embodiment\nof grace and modesty. Her gown, adorned with long fringes at the seams,\nwas beaded in blue and white across the shoulders and half way to her\nwaist. Her shining black hair was arranged in two thick plaits which\nhung down upon her bosom. There was a native dignity in her gestures\nand in her utterance of the maidens’ oath, and as she turned to face the\ncircle, all the other virgins followed her.\n\nWhen the feast was ended and the gay concourse had dispersed, Antelope\nand his cousin were among the last to withdraw. The young man’s eyes had\nfollowed every movement of Taluta as long as she remained in sight,\nand it was only when she vanished in the gathering shadows that he was\nwilling to retire.\n\nIn savage courtship, it was the custom to introduce one’s self boldly\nto the young lady, although sometimes it was convenient to have a sister\nintroduce her brother. But Antelope had no sister to perform this office\nfor him, and if he had had one, he would not have made the request. He\ndid not choose to admit any one to his secret, for he had no confidence\nin himself or in the outcome of the affair. If it had been anything like\ntrailing the doe, or scouting the Ojibway, he would have ridiculed the\nvery notion of missing the object sought. But this was a new warfare--an\nunknown hunting! Although he was very anxious to meet Taluta, whenever\nthe idea occurred to him he trembled like a leaf in the wind, and\nprofuse perspiration rolled down his stoic visage. It was not customary\nto hold any social intercourse with the members of the opposite sex,\nand he had never spoken familiarly to any woman since he became a man,\nexcept his old grandmother. It was well known that the counsel of the\naged brings luck to the youth in warfare and love.\n\nAntelope arose early the next morning, and without speaking to any one\nhe made a ceremonious toilet. He put on his finest buckskin shirt and\na handsome robe, threw a beaded quiver over his shoulder, and walked\ndirectly away from the teepees and into the forest--he did not know why\nnor whither. The sounds of the camp grew fainter and fainter, until at\nlast he found himself alone.\n\n“How is it,” mused the young man, “that I have hoped to become a leader\namong my people? My father is not a chief, and none of my ancestors were\ndistinguished in war. I know well that, if I desire to be great, I\nmust deny myself the pleasure of woman’s company until I have made my\nreputation. I must not boast nor exhibit myself on my first success. The\nspirits do not visit the common haunts of men! All these rules I have\nthus far kept, and I must not now yield to temptation.... Man has\nmuch to weaken his ambition after he is married. A young man may seek\nopportunities to prove his worth, but to a married man the opportunity\nmust come to try him. He acts only when compelled to act.... Ah, I\nmust flee from the woman!... Besides, if she should like someone else\nbetter, I should be humiliated.... I must go upon a long war-path. I\nshall forget her....”\n\nAt this point his revery was interrupted by the joyous laughter of\ntwo young women. The melodious sing-song laughter of the Sioux maiden\nstirred the very soul of the young warrior.\n\nAll his philosophy deserted him, and he stood hesitating, looking about\nhim as if for a chance of escape. A man who had never before felt the\nmagnetic influence of woman in her simplicity and childlike purity, he\nbecame for the moment incapable of speech or action.\n\nMeanwhile the two girls were wholly unconscious of any disturbing\npresence in the forest. They were telling each other the signals that\neach had received in the dance. Taluta’s companion had stopped at the\nfirst raspberry bushes, while she herself passed on to the next thicket.\nWhen she emerged from the pines into an opening, she suddenly beheld\nAntelope, in his full-dress suit of courtship. Instantly she dropped her\neyes.\n\nLuckily the customs of courtship among the Sioux allow the covering\nof one’s head with the blanket. In this attitude, the young man made a\nsignal to Taluta with trembling fingers.\n\nThe wild red man’s wooing was natural and straightforward; there was no\ncircumspection, no maneuvering for time or advantage. Hot words of love\nburst forth from the young warrior’s lips, with heavy breathing behind\nthe folds of the robe with which he sought to shield his embarrassment.\n\n“For once the spirits are guiding my fortunes! It may seem strange to\nyou, when we meet thus by accident, that I should speak immediately of\nmy love for you; but we live in a world where one must speak when the\nopportunity offers. I have thought much of you since I saw you at the\nmaidens’ feast.... Is Taluta willing to become the wife of Tatoka? The\nmoccasins of her making will cause his feet to be swift in pursuit of\nthe game, and on the trail of the enemy.... I beg of you, maiden, let\nour meeting be known only to the birds of the air, while you consider my\nproposal!”\n\nAll this while the maiden stood demurely at his side, playing with\nthe lariat of her pony in her brown, fine hands. Her doeskin gown with\nprofuse fringes hung gracefully as the drooping long leaves of the\nwillow, and her two heavy braids of black hair, mingled with strings\nof deers’ hoofs and wampum, fell upon her bosom. There was a faint glow\nunderneath her brown skin, and her black eyes were calm and soft, yet\nfull of native fire.\n\n“You will not press for an answer now,” she gently replied, without\nlooking at him. “I expected to see no one here, and your words have\ntaken me by surprise.... I grant your last request. The birds alone can\nindulge in gossip about our meeting,--unless my cousin, who is in the\nnext ravine, should see us together!” She sprang lightly upon the back\nof her pony, and disappeared among the scattered pines.\n\nBetween the first lovers’ meeting and the second was a period of one\nmoon. This was wholly the fault of Antelope, who had been a prey\nto indecision and painful thoughts. Half regretting his impulsive\ndeclaration, and hoping to forget his pangs in the chances of travel and\nwar, he had finally enlisted in the number of those who were to go with\nthe war-leader Crowhead into the Ute country. As was the custom of the\nSioux warriors upon the eve of departure, the young men consulted their\nspiritual advisers, and were frequently in the purifying vapor-bath, and\nfasting in prayer.\n\nThe last evening had come, and Antelope was on the way to the top of the\nhill behind the camp for a night of prayer. Suddenly in the half-light\nhe came full upon Taluta, leading her pony down the narrow trail. She\nhad never looked more beautiful to the youth than at that moment.\n\n“Ho,” he greeted her. She simply smiled shyly.\n\n“It is long since we met,” he ventured.\n\n“I have concluded that you do not care to hear my reply,” retorted the\ngirl.\n\n“I have nothing to say in my defense, but I hope that you will be\ngenerous. I have suffered much.... You will understand why I stand far\nfrom you,” he added gently. “I have been preparing myself to go upon\nthe warpath. We start at daylight for the Ute country. Every day for ten\ndays I have been in the vapor-bath, and ten nights fasting.”\n\nAs Taluta well knew, a young warrior under these circumstances dared not\napproach a woman, not even his own wife.\n\n“I still urge you to be my wife. Are you ready to give me your answer?”\n continued Antelope.\n\n“My answer was sent to you by your grandmother this very day,” she\nreplied softly.\n\n“Ah, tell me, tell me,...” pressed the youth eagerly.\n\n“All is well. Fear nothing,” murmured the maiden.\n\n“I have given my word--I have made my prayers and undergone\npurification. I must not withdraw from this war-path,” he said after a\nsilence. “But I know that I shall be fortunate!... My grandmother will\ngive you my love token.... Ah, kechuwa (dear love)! watch the big star\nevery night! I will watch it, too--then we shall both be watching!\nAlthough far apart, our spirits will be together.”\n\nThe moon had risen above the hill, and the cold light discovered the two\nwho stood sadly apart, their hearts hot with longing. Reluctantly, yet\nwithout a backward look or farewell gesture, the warrior went on up the\nhill, and the maiden hurried homeward. Only a few moments before she had\nbeen happy in the anticipation of making her lover happy. The truth\nwas she had been building air-castles in the likeness of a white teepee\npitched upon a virgin prairie all alone, surrounded by mountains.\nTatoka’s war-horse and hunting pony were picketed near by, and there she\nsaw herself preparing the simple meal for him! But now he has clouded\nher dreams by this untimely departure.\n\n“He is too brave.... His life will be a short one,” she said to herself\nwith foreboding.\n\nFor a few hours all was quiet, and just before the appearance of day the\nwarriors’ departure was made known by their farewell songs. Antelope\nwas in the line early, but he was heavy of heart, for he knew that his\nsweetheart was sorely puzzled and disappointed by his abrupt departure.\nHis only consolation was the knowledge that he had in his bundle a pair\nof moccasins made by her hands. He had not yet seen them, because it was\nthe custom not to open any farewell gifts until the first camp was made,\nand then they must be opened before the eyes of all the young men! It\nbrings luck to the war-party, they said. He would have preferred to keep\nhis betrothal secret, but there was no escaping the custom.\n\nAll the camp-fires were burning and supper had been eaten, when the\nherald approached every group and announced the programme for the\nevening. It fell to Antelope to open his bundle first. Loud laughter\npealed forth when the reluctant youth brought forth a superb pair of\nmoccasins--the recognized lovegift! At such times the warriors’ jokes\nwere unmerciful, for it was considered a last indulgence in jesting,\nperhaps for many moons. The recipient was well known to be a novice\nin love, and this token first disclosed the fact that he had at last\nsuccumbed to the allurements of woman. When he sang his love-song he was\nobliged to name the giver of the token, and many a disappointed suitor\nwas astonished to hear Taluta’s name.\n\nIt was a long journey to the Ute country, and when they reached it there\nwas a stubbornly contested fight. Both sides claimed the victory, and\nboth lost several men. Here again Antelope was signally favored by the\ngods of war. He counted many coups or blows, and exhibited his bravery\nagain and again in the charges, but he received no wound.\n\n\nOn the return journey Taluta’s beautiful face was constantly before\nhim. He was so impatient to see her that he hurried on in advance of his\nparty, when they were still several days’ travel from the Sioux camp.\n\n“This time I shall join in all the dances and participate in the\nrejoicings, for she will surely like to have me do so,” he thought to\nhimself. “She will join also, and I know that none is a better dancer\nthan Taluta!”\n\nIn fancy, Antelope was practicing the songs of victory as he rode alone\nover the vast wild country.\n\nHe had now passed Wild Horse Creek and the Black Hills lay to the\nsoutheast, while the Big Horn range loomed up to the north in gigantic\nproportions. He felt himself at home.\n\n“I shall now be a man indeed. I shall have a wife!” he said aloud.\n\nAt last he reached the point from which he expected to view the distant\ncamp. Alas, there was no camp there! Only a solitary teepee gleamed\nforth upon the green plain, which was almost surrounded by a quick turn\nof the River of Deep Woods. The teepee appeared very white. A peculiar\ntingling sensation passed through his frame, and the pony whinnied often\nas he was urged forward at a gallop.\n\nWhen Antelope beheld the solitary teepee he knew instantly what it was.\nIt was a grave! Sometimes a new white lodge was pitched thus for\nthe dead, who lay in state within upon a couch of finest skins, and\nsurrounded by his choicest possessions.\n\nAntelope’s excitement increased as he neared the teepee, which was\nprotected by a barricade of thick brush. It stood alone and silent in\nthe midst of the deserted camp. He kicked the sides of his tired horse\nto make him go faster. At last he jumped from the saddle and ran\ntoward the door. There he paused for a moment, and at the thought of\ndesecrating a grave, a cold terror came over him.\n\n“I must see--I must see!” he said aloud, and desperately he broke\nthrough the thorny fence and drew aside the oval swinging door.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nIn the stately white teepee, seen from afar, both grave and monument,\nthere lay the fair body of Taluta! The bier was undisturbed, and the\nmaiden looked beautiful as if sleeping, dressed in her robes of ceremony\nand surrounded by all her belongings.\n\nHer lover looked upon her still face and cried aloud. “Hey, hey, hey!\nAlas! alas! If I had known of this while in the Ute country, you would\nnot be lonely on the spirit path.”\n\nHe withdrew, and laid the doorflap reverently back in its place. How\nlong he stood without the threshold he could not tell. He stood with\nhead bowed down upon his breast, tearless and motionless, utterly\noblivious to everything save the bier of his beloved. His charger grazed\nabout for a long time where he had left him, but at last he endeavored\nby a low whinny to attract his master’s attention, and Antelope awoke\nfrom his trance of sorrow.\n\nThe sun was now hovering over the western ridges. The mourner’s throat\nwas parched, and perspiration rolled down his cheeks, yet he was\nconscious of nothing but a strong desire to look upon her calm, sweet\nface once more.\n\nHe kindled a small fire a little way off, and burned some cedar berries\nand sweet-smelling grass. Then he fumigated himself thoroughly to dispel\nthe human atmosphere, so that the spirit might not be offended by his\napproach, for he greatly desired to obtain a sign from her spirit.\nHe had removed his garments and stood up perfectly nude save for the\nbreechclout. His long hair was unbraided and hung upon his shoulders,\nveiling the upper half of his splendid body. Thus standing, the lover\nsang a dirge of his own making. The words were something like this:\n\n\n   Ah, spirit, thy flight is mysterious!\n\n   While the clouds are stirred by our wailing,\n\n   And our tears fall faster in sorrow--\n\n\n   While the cold sweat of night benumbs us,\n\n   Thou goest alone on thy journey,\n\n   In the midst of the shining star people!\n\n\n   Thou goest alone on thy journey--\n\n   Thy memory shall be our portion;\n\n   Until death we must watch for the spirit!\n\n\nThe eyes of Antelope were closed while he chanted the dirge. He sang it\nover and over, pausing between the lines, and straining as it were every\nsense lest he might not catch the rapt whisper of her spirit, but only\nthe distant howls of coyotes answered him. His body became cold and numb\nfrom sheer exhaustion, and at last his knees bent under him and he sank\ndown upon the ground, still facing the teepee. Unconsciousness overtook\nhim, and in his sleep or trance the voice came:\n\n“Do not mourn for me, my friend! Come into my teepee, and eat of my\nfood.”\n\nIt seemed to Antelope that he faltered for a moment; then he entered\nthe teepee. There was a cheerful fire burning in the center. A basin\nof broiled buffalo meat was placed opposite the couch of Taluta, on the\nother side of the fire. Its odor was delicious to him, yet he hesitated\nto eat of it.\n\n“Fear not, kechuwa (my darling)! It will give you strength,” said the\nvoice.\n\nThe maid was natural as in life. Beautifully attired, she sat up on her\nbed, and her demeanor was cheerful and kind.\n\nThe young man ate of the food in silence and without looking at the\nspirit. “Ho, kechuwa!” he said to her when returning the dish, according\nto the custom of his people.\n\nSilently the two sat for some minutes, while the youth gazed into the\nburning embers.\n\n“Be of good heart,” said Taluta, at last, “for you shall meet my twin\nspirit! She will love you as I do, and you will love her as you love me.\nThis was our covenant before we came into this world.”\n\nThe conception of a “twin spirit” was familiar to the Sioux. “Ho,”\n responded the warrior, with dignity and all seriousness. He felt a great\nawe for the spirit, and dared not lift his eyes to her face.\n\n“Weep no more, kechuwa, weep no more,” she softly added; and the next\nmoment Antelope found himself outside the mysterious teepee. His limbs\nwere stiff and cold, but he did not feel faint nor hungry. Having filled\nhis pipe, he held it up to the spirits and then partook of the smoke;\nand thus revived, he slowly and reluctantly left the sacred spot.\n\nThe main war-party also visited the old camp and saw the solitary teepee\ngrave, but did not linger there. They continued on the trail of\nthe caravan until they reached the new camping ground. They called\nthemselves successful, although they had left several of their number\non the field. Their triumph songs indicated this; therefore the people\nhurried to receive the news and to learn who were the unfortunates.\n\nThe father of Antelope was foremost among those who ran to meet the\nwar-party. He learned that his son had distinguished himself in the\nfight, and that his name was not mentioned among the brave dead.\n\n“And where, then, is he?” he asked, with unconcealed anxiety.\n\n“He left us three days ago to come in advance,” they replied.\n\n“But he has not arrived!” exclaimed old Wezee, in much agitation.\n\nHe returned to his teepee, where he consoled himself as best he could by\nsmoking the pipe in solitude. He could neither sing praises nor indulge\nin the death dirge, and none came in either to congratulate or mourn\nwith him.\n\nThe sun had disappeared behind the hills, and the old man still sat\ngazing into the burning embers, when he heard a horse’s footfall at the\ndoor of his lodge.\n\n“Ho, atay (father)!” came the welcome call.\n\n“Mechinkshe! mechinkshe!” (my son, my son), he replied in unrestrained\njoy. Old Wezee now stood on the threshold and sang the praise song for\nhis son, ending with a warwhoop such as he had not indulged in since he\nwas quite a young man.\n\nThe camp was once more alive with the dances, and the dull thud of the\nIndian drum was continually in the air. The council had agreed that\nAntelope was entitled to wear a war-bonnet of eagles’ feathers. He was\naccordingly summoned before the aboriginal parliament, and from the wise\nmen of the tribe he received his degree of war-bonnet.\n\nIt was a public ceremony. The great pipe was held up for him to take the\nsmoke of high honor.\n\nThe happiest person present was the father of Antelope; but he himself\nremained calm and unmoved throughout the ceremony.\n\n“He is a strange person,” was the whisper among a group of youths who\nwere watching the proceedings with envious eyes.\n\nThe young man was strangely listless and depressed in spirit. His old\ngrandmother knew why, but none of the others understood. He never joined\nin the village festivities, while the rest of his family were untiring\nin the dances, and old Wezee was at the height of his happiness.\n\nIt was a crisp October morning, and the family were eating their\nbreakfast of broiled bison meat, when the large drum at the council\nlodge was struck three times. The old man set down his wooden basin.\n\n“Ah, my son, the war-chiefs will make an announcement! It may be a call\nfor the enlistment of warriors! I am sorry,” he said, and paused. “I\nam sorry, because I would rather no war-party went out at present. I\nam getting old. I have enjoyed your success, my son. I love to hear the\npeople speak your name. If you go again upon the war-path, I shall no\nlonger be able to join in the celebrations. Something tells me that you\nwill not return!”\n\nYoung braves were already on their way to the council lodge. Tatoka\nlooked, and the temptation was great.\n\n“Father, it is not becoming for me to remain at home when others go,” he\nsaid, at last.\n\n“Ho,” was the assent uttered by the father, with a deep sigh.\n\n“Five hundred braves have enlisted to go with the great war prophet\nagainst the three confederated tribes,” he afterward reported at home,\nwith an air of elation which he had not worn for some moons.\n\nSince Antelope had received the degree of war-bonnet, his father had\nspared neither time nor his meager means in his behalf. He had bartered\nhis most cherished possessions for several eagles that were brought\nin by various hunters of the camp, and with his own hands had made a\nhandsome war-bonnet for his son.\n\n“You will now wear a war-bonnet for the first time, and you are the\nfirst of our family who has earned the right to wear one for many\ngenerations. I am proud of you, my son,” he said as he presented it.\n\nBut when the youth replied: “Ho, ho, father! I ought to be a brave man\nin recognition of this honor,” he again sighed heavily.\n\n“It is that I feared, my son! Many a young man has lost his life for\nvanity and love of display!”\n\nThe evening serenades began early, for the party was to leave at once.\nIn groups upon their favorite ponies the warriors rode around the inner\ncircle of the great camp, singing their war-songs. All the people came\nout of the teepees, and sitting by twos and threes upon the ground,\nbedecked with savage finery, they watched and listened. The pretty wild\nmaidens had this last opportunity given them to look upon the faces of\ntheir sweethearts, whom they might never see again. Here and there\nan old man was singing the gratitude song or thank-offering, while\nannouncing the first warpath of a novice, for such an announcement meant\nthe giving of many presents to the poor and aged. So the camp was filled\nwith songs of joy and pride in the departing husbands, brothers, and\nsons.\n\nAs soon as darkness set in the sound of the rude native flute was added\nto the celebration. This is the lover’s farewell. The young braves,\nwrapped from head to foot in their finest robes, each sounded the\nplaintive strains near the teepee of the beloved. The playful yodeling\nof many voices in chorus was heard at the close of each song.\n\nAt midnight the army of five hundred, the flower of the Sioux, marched\nagainst their ancient enemy. Antelope was in the best of spirits. He had\nhis war-bonnet to display before the enemy! He was now regarded as one\nof the foremost warriors of his band, and might probably be asked to\nperform some specially hazardous duty, so that he was fully prepared to\nearn further distinction.\n\nIn five days the Sioux were encamped within a day’s travel of the\npermanent village of the confederated tribes--the Rees, Mandans, and\nGros Ventres. The war-chief selected two men, Antelope and Eaglechild,\nto scout at night in advance of the main force. It was thought that most\nof the hunters had already returned to their winter quarters, and in\nthis case the Sioux would have no mean enemy to face. On the other hand,\na battle was promised that would enlarge their important traditions.\n\nThe two made their way as rapidly as possible toward the ancestral home\nof their enemies. It was a night perfectly suited to what they had to\ndo, for the moon was full, the fleeting clouds hiding it from time to\ntime and casting deceptive shadows.\n\nWhen they had come within a short distance of the lodges unperceived,\nthey lay flat for a long time, and studied the ways of the young men in\nevery particular, for it was Antelope’s plan to enter the great village\nand mingle boldly with its inhabitants. Even their hoots and love-calls\nwere carefully noted, so that they might be able to imitate them.\nThere were several entertainments in progress in different parts of the\nvillage, yet it was apparent that the greatest vigilance was observed.\nThe lodges of poles covered with earth were partly underground, and at\none end the war-horses were stabled, as a precaution against a possible\nsurprise.\n\nAt the moment that a large cloud floated over the moon, casting a\nshadow large enough to cover the entire village, the drum in one of the\nprincipal lodges was struck in quick time, accompanied by boisterous\nwar-whoops and singing. The two scouts adjusted their robes about them\nin the fashion of the strangers, and walked openly in that direction.\n\nThey glanced quickly from side to side as they approached, but no one\npaid any attention, so they came up with other young men and peeped\nthrough the chinks in the earth wigwam. It was a great gambling party.\nAmong the guests were several distinguished warriors, and each at an\nopportune time would rise and recount his great deeds in warfare against\nthe Sioux. The strangers could read their gestures, and Antelope was\nonce or twice almost on the point of stringing his bow to send an arrow\nthrough the audacious speaker.\n\nAs they moved about the village, taking note of its numbers and\nsituation, and waiting an opportunity to withdraw without exciting\nsuspicion, they observed some of the younger braves standing near\nanother large wigwam, and one or two even peeped within. Moved by sudden\ncuriosity, Antelope followed their example. He uttered a low exclamation\nand at once withdrew.\n\n“What is it?” asked his companion, but received no answer.\n\nIt was evidently the home of a chief. The family were seated within at\ntheir usual occupations, and the bright light of the central fire shone\nfull upon the face of a most lovely maiden.\n\nAntelope stood apparently motionless, but he was trembling under his\nrobe like a leaf.\n\n“Come, friend, there is another large cloud almost over the moon! We\nmust move away under its concealing shadow,” urged Eaglechild.\n\nThe other stood still as if undecided, but at last he approached the\nlodge and looked in a second time. There sat his sweetheart in human\nform once more! The maiden was attired in a doeskin gown set with elk’s\nteeth like ivory. Her eyes were cast down demurely over her embroidery,\nbut in every feature she was the living counterpart of Taluta!\n\nAt last the two got away unobserved, and hastened toward the place where\nthey had concealed their horses. But here Antelope sent his companion on\nin advance, making the excuse that he wished to study further the best\nposition from which to make the attack.\n\nWhen he was left alone he stood still for a moment to decide upon a\nplan. He could think of nothing but that he must meet the Ree maiden\nbefore daylight! He realized the extreme hazard of the attempt, but he\nalso recalled what he had been told by the spirit of Taluta, and the\nsupernatural command seemed to justify him even in going thus upon the\neve of battle to meet the enemy of his people.\n\nHe skirted the heavy timber and retraced his steps to a point from which\nhe could see the village. The drum of the gambling party had ceased with\nthe shouts and laughter of the players. Apparently the village was lost\nin slumber. The moon had set, and without pausing he advanced to the\nhome of the girl. As he came near some dogs began to bark, but he\nsilenced them after the manner of the Rees, and they obeyed him.\n\nWhen Antelope softly raised the robe that hung over the entrance to the\nchief’s lodge, he saw the fire smoldering in the center, and the members\nof the household lying in their respective places, all seemingly in a\ndeep sleep. The girl lay opposite the entrance, where he had seen her\nseated in the early part of the evening.\n\nThe heart of the Sioux beat violently, and he glanced nervously to left\nand right. There was neither sound nor movement. Then he pulled his robe\ncompletely over his head, after the fashion of a Ree lover, and softly\nentered the wigwam.\n\nThe Ree maiden, having industriously worked on her embroidery until far\ninto the night, had retired to rest. In her dreams, the twin sister came\nto her of whom she had had visions ever since she could remember, and\nespecially when something of importance was about to happen.\n\nThis time she came with a handsome young man of another tribe, and said:\n“Sister, I bring you a Sioux, who will be your husband!”\n\nThe dreamer opened her eyes to behold a youth bending over her and\ngently pulling her robe, as a suitor is permitted to do to awaken his\nbeloved.\n\nWhen he saw that she was awake, the Sioux touched his breast, saying in\na whisper, “Tatoka,” and made the sign for Antelope. This pleased the\nRee girl, for her own brother, who had died the year before, had borne\nthat name. She immediately sat up and stirred the embers into a light\nblaze. Then she took hold of his blanket and drew it from his face; and\nthere she seemed to see the very features of the man of her vision!\n\nHe took her hand in his, and she felt the force of love stream through\nhis long, nervous fingers, and instinctively knew his thoughts. In her\nturn she touched her breast and made the sign for Shield, pronouncing in\nher own tongue the word, Stasu. This seemed to him also a name of good\nomen, and in the sign language which was common to all the people of the\nplains, he asked her to be his wife.\n\nVividly her dream came back to her, and she could not refuse the\nstranger. Her soul already responded to his; and for a few minutes they\nsat silently side by side. When he arose and beckoned, “Come with me,”\n she had no question to make, and without a word she followed him from\nher father’s lodge and out into the forest.\n\n\nIn the midst of his ascending fame, at a moment when opportunity seemed\nto favor his ambition, the brave Antelope had mysteriously disappeared!\nHis companion scout returned with a favorable report. He said that the\nmen of the three confederated tribes were gambling and feasting, wholly\nunconscious of danger, and that Antelope would follow him with a further\nreport upon the best point of attack. The red warriors impatiently\nawaited his return, until it became apparent that they could wait no\nlonger without sacrificing their chance of success. When the attack was\nmade it was already rather late. The sun had fairly cleared the eastern\nhills, and most of the men were outside their lodges.\n\nIt was a great battle! Again and again the Sioux were repulsed, but\nas often they rallied and repeated the charge until sundown, when they\neffected their retreat with considerable loss. Had Antelope returned\nin due season, the charge would have been made before dawn, while the\npeople were yet asleep.\n\nWhen the battle was over, the Rees, Mandans, and Gros Ventres gathered\ntheir dead and wounded. The night was filled with mourning. Soon the sad\nnews was heralded throughout the camp that the beautiful daughter of the\nRee chief was among the missing. It was supposed that she must have been\ncaptured while driving her ponies to water in the early morning. The\ngrief for her loss was mingled with horror, because of a fear that she\nmight suffer humiliation at the hands of the Sioux warriors, and among\nthe young men there were muttered threats that the Sioux would pay\ndearly for this.\n\nThough partially successful, the Sioux had lost many of their bravest\nwarriors, and none could tell what had happened to Antelope--he who had\nbeen believed the favorite of the gods of war. It was suggested by some\nenvious ones that perhaps he had recognized the strongly entrenched\nposition of the three tribes, and believing the battle would be a\ndisastrous one, had set out for home without making his report. But this\nsupposition was not deemed credible. On the other hand, the idea was\nentertained that he had reentered the village, was detected and slain;\nand therefore the enemy was on the lookout when the attack was made.\n\n“Hay, hay, hay, mechinkshe (Alas, alas, my son)!” was the sorrowful\ncry with which his old father received the news. His head fell upon his\nbreast, and all the others groaned in sympathy.\n\nThe sunset sky was a blanket of beautiful painting. There were\ncamp-fires among the clouds in orange and scarlet, while some were black\nas night. So the camp fairly glowed in celebration of its heroes; yet\nthere was deep grief in many families. When the evening meal had been\neaten and the people were sitting outside their lodges, a tall old\nman, almost nude, appeared in the circle, riding a fine horse. He had\nblackened his face, his hair was cut short, and the horse also had been\ndeprived of his flowing mane and tail. Both were in deep mourning, after\nthe fashion of the Sioux.\n\n“Ho ho!” exclaimed many warriors as he passed them, singing in a hoarse,\nguttural voice.\n\n“Ugh, he sings a war-song!” remarked one.\n\n“Yes, I am told that he will find his son’s bones, or leave his own in\nthe country of the enemy!”\n\n\nThe rain had fallen incessantly for two days. The fleeing lovers had\nreached this lonely mountain valley of the Big Horn region on the night\nthat the cold fall rains set in, and Antelope had hurriedly constructed\nan arbor house or rude shelter of pine and cedar boughs.\n\nIt was enough. There they sat, man and wife, in their first home of\nliving green! The cheerful fire was burning in the center, and the happy\nsmoke went straight up among the tall pines. There was no human eye\nto gaze upon them to embarrass--not even a common language in which to\nexpress their love for one another.\n\nTheir marriage, they believed, was made by a spirit, and it was holy in\ntheir minds. Each had cast away his people and his all for the sake of\nthis emotion which had suddenly overtaken them both with overwhelming\nforce, and the warrior’s ambition had disappeared before it like a\nmorning mist before the sun.\n\nTo them a new life was just beginning, and they had all but forgotten\nthe existence of any world save this. The young bride was enshrined in a\nbower of spicy fragrance, and her face shone whenever her eyes met those\nof her husband.\n\n“This is as I would have it, kechuwa (darling)!” exclaimed the Sioux in\nhis own language. She simply responded with a childlike smile. Although\nshe did not understand his words, she read in the tones of his voice\nonly happy and loving thoughts.\n\nThe Ree girl had prepared a broiled bison steak, and her husband was\nkeeping the fire well fed with dry fagots. The odor of the buming fat\nwas delicious, and the gentle patter of the rain made a weird music\noutside their wigwam.\n\nAs soon as her husband had left her alone--for he must go to water the\nponies and conceal them at a distance--Stasu came out to collect more\nwood. Instinctively she looked all about her. Huge mountains towered\nskyward, clad in pines. The narrow valley in which she was wound its way\nbetween them, and on every side there was heavy forest.\n\nShe stood silent and awed, scarcely able to realize that she had\nbegun her new life absolutely alone, with no other woman to advise or\ncongratulate her, and visited only by the birds of the air. Yet all the\nworld to her just now was Antelope! No other woman could smile on him.\nHe could not talk to any one but her. The evening drum at the council\nlodge could not summon him away from her, and she was well content.\n\nWhen the young wife had done everything she could think of in\npreparation for her husband’s return, including the making of several\nbirch-bark basins and pails for water, the rain had quite ceased, so\nshe spread her robe just outside the lodge and took up her work-bag, in\nwhich she had several pairs of moccasin-tops already beaded.\n\nWhile she bent over her work, getting up from time to time to turn the\nroast which she had impaled upon a sharp stick above the glowing coals,\nthe bride had a stream of shy callers, of the little people of the\nwoods. She sat very still, so as not to startle them, and there is much\ncuriosity among these people concerning a stranger.\n\nPresently she was startled by a footfall not unlike that of a man. She\nhad not been married long enough to know the sound of her husband’s\nstep, and she felt a thrill of joy and fear alternately. It might be he,\nand it might be a stranger! She was loath to look up, but at last gave\na furtive glance, and met squarely the eyes of a large grizzly bear, who\nwas seated upon his haunches not far away.\n\nStasu was surprised, but she showed no fear; and fearlessness is the\nbest shield against wild animals. In a moment she got up unconcernedly,\nand threw a large piece of meat to the stranger.\n\n“Take of my wedding feast, O great Bear!” she addressed him, “and be\ngood to me to bless my first teepee! O be kind and recognize my brave\nact in taking for my husband one of the warriors of the Sioux, the\nancient enemy of my people! I have accepted a husband of a language\nother than mine, and am come to live among you as your neighbor. I offer\nyou my friendship!”\n\nThe bear’s only answer to her prayer was a low growl, but having eaten\nthe meat, he turned and clumsily departed.\n\nIn the meantime Antelope had set himself to master the geography of that\nregion, to study the outlook for game, and ascertain the best approaches\nto their secret home. It was already settled in his mind that he\ncould never return either to his wife’s people or to his own. His\nfellow-warriors would not forgive his desertion, and the Rees could not\nbe expected to welcome as a kinsman one of the foremost of their ancient\nfoes. There was nothing to be done but to remain in seclusion, and let\nthem say what they would of him!\n\nHe had loved the Ree maiden from the first moment he beheld her by the\nlight of the blazing embers, and that love must satisfy him. It was\nwell that he had never cared much for company, but had spent many of his\nyoung days in solitude and fasting. It did not seem at all strange to\nhim that he had been forced to retreat into an unknown and wild country\nwith a woman whom he saw in the evening for the first time, and fled\nwith as his own wife before sunrise!\n\nBy the afternoon he had thoroughly informed himself upon the nature of\nthe surrounding country. Everything on the face of the map was surveyed\nand charted in his mind, in accordance with his habits and training.\nThis done, he turned toward his secret dwelling. As he walked rapidly\nand noiselessly through the hidden valleys and along the singing\nstreams, he noticed fresh signs of the deer, elk, and other wild tribes\namong whom he had chosen to abide. “They shall be my people,” he said to\nhimself.\n\nBehind a group of cedars he paused to reconnoiter, and saw the\npine-bough wigwam like a giant plant, each row of boughs overlapping\nthe preceding circular row like the scales of a fish. Stasu was sitting\nbefore it upon a buffalorobe, attired in her best doeskin gown. Her\ndelicate oval face was touched with red paint, and her slender brown\nhands were occupied with a moccasin meant for him to wear. He could\nscarcely believe that it was a mortal woman that he saw before him\nin broad day--the pride of No Man’s Trail, for that is what the Crow\nIndians call that valley!\n\n“Ho, ho, kechuwa!” he exclaimed as he approached her, and her heart\nleaped in recognition of the magnetic words of love.\n\n“It is good that we are alone! I shall never want to go back to my\npeople so long as I have you. I can dwell here with you forever,\nunless you should think otherwise!” she exclaimed in her own tongue,\naccompanied by graphic signs.\n\n“Ho, I think of nothing else! I can see in every creature only friendly\nways and good feeling. We can live alone here, happily, unless you\nshould feel differently,” he replied in his own language with the signs,\nso that his bride understood him.\n\nThe environment was just what it should be when two people are united in\nmarriage. The wedding music was played by Nature, and trees, brooks,\nand the birds of the air contributed their peculiar strains to a great\nharmony. All of the people on No Man’s Trail were polite, and understood\nthe reserves of love. These two had yielded to a simple and natural\nimpulse; but its only justification to their minds was the mysterious\nleading of the twin spirit! That was the sum total of their excuse, and\nit was enough.\n\nBefore the rigor of winter had set in, Tatoka brought to his bride\nmany buffalo skins. She was thoroughly schooled in the arts of savage\nwomanhood; in fact, every Indian maid was trained with this thought\nin view--that she should become a beautiful, strong, skillful wife and\nmother--the mother of a noble race of warriors!\n\nIn a short time within that green and pine-scented enclosure there smiled\na little wild paradise. Hard by the pine-bough wigwam there stood a new\nwhite buffalo-skin teepee, tanned, cut, sewed, and pitched by the hands\nof Stasu. Away in the woods, down by the rushing brook, was her tannery,\nand not far away, in a sunny, open spot, she prepared her sun-cured\nmeats for winter use. Her kitchen was a stone fireplace in a shady spot,\nand her parlor was the lodge of evergreen, overhung on two sides by\ninaccessible ledges, and bounded on the other two by the sparkling\nstream. It was a secret place, and yet a citadel; a silent place, and\nyet not lonely!\n\nThe winter was cold and long, but the pair were happy in one another’s\ncompany, and accepted their strange lot as one that was chosen for them\nby the spirits. Stasu had insisted upon her husband speaking to her in\nhis own language, that she might learn it quickly. In a little while she\nwas able to converse with him, and when she had acquired his language\nshe taught him hers.\n\nWhile Antelope was occupied with hunting and exploring the country,\nalways keeping in mind the danger of discovery by some wandering scout\nor hunter, his wife grew well acquainted with the wild inhabitants of\nNo Man’s Trail. These people are as full of curiosity as man, and as the\nSioux never hunted near his home, they were entirely fearless. Many came\nto the door of Stasu’s lodge, and she was not afraid, but offered them\nfood and spoke to them kindly. All animals judge by signs and are\nquick in reading tones and gestures; so that the Ree girl soon had\ngrandfathers and grandmothers, after the Indian fashion, among the\nwolves and bears that came oftenest for food.\n\nHer husband in the field had also his fellow-hunters and friends. When\nhe killed the buffalo he always left enough meat for the wolves, the\neagles, and the ravens to feast upon, and these watched for the coming\nof the lonely wild man. More than once they told him by their actions of\nthe presence of a distant campfire, but in each instance it proved to be\na small war-party which had passed below them on the trail.\n\nAgain it was summer. Never had the mountains looked grander or more\nmysterious to the eyes of the two. The valley was full of the music\nand happiness of the winged summer people; the trees wore their summer\nattire, and the meadow its green blanket. There were many homes made\nhappy by the coming of little people everywhere, but no pair was happier\nthan Stasu and her husband when one morning they saw their little\nbrave lying wrapped in soft deerskins, and heard for the first time his\nplaintive voice!\n\nThat morning, when Antelope set out on the hunt, he stopped at the\nstream and looked at himself seriously to see whether he had changed\nsince the day before. He must now appear much graver, he said to\nhimself, because he is the father of a new man!\n\nIn spite of himself, his thoughts were with his own people, and he\nwondered what his old grandmother would have said to his child! He\nlooked away off toward the Black Hills, to the Sioux country, and in his\nheart he said, “I am a coward!”\n\nThe boy grew naturally, and never felt the lack of playmates and\ncompanions, for his mother was ingenious in devising plays for him, and\nin winning for him the confidence and kindness of the animal friends. He\nwas the young chief and the hero of No Man’s Trail! The bears and wolves\nwere his warriors; the buffalo and elk the hostile tribes upon whom he\nwent to war. Small as he was, he soon preferred to roam alone in the\nwoods. His parents were often anxious, but, on the other hand, they\nentertained the hope that he would some day be “wakan,” a mysterious or\nsupernatural man, for he was getting power from his wild companions and\nfrom the silent forces of nature.\n\nOne day, when he was about five years old, he gave a dance for his wild\npets upon the little plateau which was still their home. He had clothed\nMato, the bear, in one of his father’s suits as a great medicine-man.\nWaho, the wolf, was painted up as a brave; and the young buffalo calf\nwas attired in one of his mother’s gowns. The boy acted as chief and\nmaster of ceremonies.\n\nThe savage mother watched him with undisguised pride, mingled with\nsorrow. Tears coursed down her dusky cheeks, although at the same time\nshe could not help laughing heartily at the strange performance. When\nthe play was ended, and she had served the feast at its close, Stasu\nseemed lost in thought.\n\n“He should not live in this way,” she was saying to herself. “He should\nknow the traditions and great deeds of my people! Surely his grandfather\nwould be proud of the boy!”\n\nThat evening, while the boy slept, and Mato lay outside the lodge\neagerly listening and sniffing the night air, the parents sat silent and\nill at ease. After a long time Stasu spoke her mind.\n\n“My husband, you ask me why I am sad. It is because I think that the\nGreat Mystery will be displeased if we keep this little boy forever in\nthe wilderness. It is wrong to allow him to grow up among wild animals;\nand if sickness or accident should deprive him of his father and mother,\nour spirits would never rest, because we had left him alone! I have\ndecided to ask you to take us back, either to your people or to my\npeople. We must sacrifice our pride, or, if needs be, our lives, for his\nlife and happiness!”\n\nThis speech of Stasu’s was a surprise to her husband. His eyes rested\nupon the ground as he listened, and his face assumed the proverbial\nstoical aspect, yet in it there was not lacking a certain nobleness. At\nlast he lifted his eyes to hers, and said:\n\n“You have spoken wise words, and it shall be as you have said. We shall\nreturn to your people. If I am to die at the hands of the ancient enemy\nof the Sioux, I shall die because of my love for you, and for our child.\nBut I cannot go back to my own people to be ridiculed by unworthy young\nmen for yielding to love of a Ree maiden!”\n\nThere was much feeling behind these words of Antelope. The rigid customs\nof his people are almost a religion, and there is one thing above\nall else which a Sioux cannot bear--that is the ridicule of his\nfellow-warriors. Yes, he can endure severe punishment or even death at\nthe hands of the enemy rather than a single laugh of derision from a\nSioux!\n\nIn a few days the household articles were packed, and the three sadly\nturned their backs upon their home. Stasu and her husband were very\nsilent as they traveled slowly along. When they reached the hill called\n“Born-of-Day,” and she saw from its summit the country of her people\nlying below her, she cried aloud, weeping happy tears. Antelope sat near\nby with bowed head, silently smoking.\n\nFinally on the fifth day they arrived within sight of the great\npermanent village of the three tribes. They saw the earth lodges as\nof old, thickly clustered along the flats of the Missouri, among their\nrustling maize-fields. Antelope stopped. “I think you had better give\nme something to eat, woman,” he said, smiling. It was the Sioux way of\nsaying, “Let me have my last meal!”\n\nAfter they had eaten, Stasu opened her buckskin bags and gave her\nhusband his finest suit. He dressed himself carefully in the fashion\nof his tribe, putting on all the feathers to which he was entitled as\na warrior. The boy also was decked out in gala attire, and Stasu, the\nmatron, had never looked more beautiful in her gown of ceremony with the\ndecoration of elks’ teeth, the same that she had worn on the evening of\nher disappearance.\n\nAs she dressed herself, the unwelcome thought forced itself upon\nher,--“What if my love is killed by my own countrymen in their frenzy?\nThis beautiful gown must then give place to a poor one, and this hair\nwill be cut short!” for such is the mourning of the widow among her\npeople.\n\nThe three rode openly down the long slope, and were instantly discovered\nby the people of the village. Soon the plain was black with the\napproaching riders. Stasu had begged her husband to remain behind, while\nshe went on alone with the boy to obtain forgiveness, but he sternly\nrefused, and continued in advance. When the foremost Ree warriors came\nwithin arrow-shot they began to shoot, to which he paid no attention.\n\nBut the child screamed with terror, and Stasu cried out in her own\ntongue:\n\n“Do not shoot! I am the daughter of your chief!”\n\nOne of them returned the reply: “She is killed by the Sioux!” But when\nthe leaders saw her plainly they were astounded.\n\nFor a time there was great confusion. Some held that they should all\ndie, for the woman had been guilty of treason to her people, and even\nnow she might be playing a trick upon them. Who could say that behind\nthat hill there was not a Sioux war-party?\n\n“No, no,” replied others. “They are in our power. Let them tell their\nstory!”\n\nStasu told it simply, and said in conclusion:\n\n“This man, one of the bravest and most honorable men of his tribe,\ndeserted on the night of the attack, and all because he loved a\nRee maiden! He now comes to be your brother-in-law, who will fight\nhenceforth for you and with you, even if it be against his own people.\n\n“He does not beg for mercy--he can dare anything! But I am a woman--my\nheart is soft--I ask for the lives of my husband and my son, who is the\ngrandson of your chief!”\n\n“He is a coward who touches this man!” exclaimed the leader, and a\nthunder of warwhoops went up in approval of his words.\n\nThe warriors formed themselves in two great columns, riding twenty\nabreast, behind and in front of the strangers. The old chief came out to\nmeet them, and took his son-inlaw’s hand. Thus they entered the village\nin battle array, but with hearts touched with wonder and great gladness,\ndischarging their arrows upward in clouds and singing peace-songs.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE MADNESS OF BALD EAGLE\n\n“It was many years ago, when I was only a child,” began White Ghost,\nthe patriarchal old chief of the Yanktonnais Sioux, “that our band was\nengaged in a desperate battle with the Rees and Mandans. The cause of\nthe fight was a peculiar one. I will tell you about it.” And he laid\naside his longstemmed pipe and settled himself to the recital.\n\n“At that time the Yanktonnais numbered a little over forty families.\nWe were nicknamed by the other bands Shunkikcheka, or Domestic Dogs,\nbecause of our owning large numbers of these animals. My father was the\nhead chief.\n\n“Our favorite wintering place was a timbered tract near the mouth of the\nGrand River, and it was here that we met the Blackfoot Sioux in the fall\nhunt. On the opposite side of the river from our camp was the permanent\nvillage of the Rees and Mandans, whose houses were of dirt and partly\nunderground. For a hundred years before this time they had planted\nlarge gardens, and we were accustomed to buy of them corn, beans, and\npumpkins. From time to time our people had made treaties of peace with\nthem. Each family of the Rees had one or two buffalo boats--not round,\nas the Sioux made them, but two or three skins long. In these boats they\nbrought quantities of dried beans and other vegetables to trade with us\nfor jerked buffalo meat.\n\n“It was a great gathering and a time of general festivity and\nhospitality. The Sioux young men were courting the Ree girls, and the\nRee braves were courting our girls, while the old people bartered their\nproduce. All day the river was alive with canoes and its banks rang with\nthe laughter of the youths and maidens.\n\n“My father’s younger brother, whose name was Big Whip, had a close\nfriend, a young man who ever after the event of which I am about to tell\nyou was known as Bald Eagle. They were both daring young men and very\nambitious for distinction. They had been following the Ree girls to\ntheir canoes as they returned to their homes in the evening.\n\n“Big Whip and his friend stood upon the river bank at sunset, one with a\nquiver full of arrows upon his back while the other carried a gun under\nhis blanket. Nearly all the people of the other village had crossed the\nriver, and the chief of the Rees, whose name was Bald Eagle, went home\nwith his wife last of all. It was about dusk as they entered their\nbullhide boat, and the two Sioux stood there looking at them.\n\n“Suddenly Big Whip exclaimed: ‘Friend, let us kill the chief. I dare you\nto kill and scalp him!’ His friend replied:\n\n“‘It shall be as you say. I will stand by you in all things. I am\nwilling to die with you.’\n\n“Accordingly Bald Eagle pulled out his gun and shot the Ree dead. From\nthat day he took his name. The old man fell backward into his boat, and\nthe old woman screamed and wept as she rowed him across the river. The\nother young man shot an arrow or two at the wife, but she continued to\nrow until she reached the other bank.\n\n“There was great excitement on both sides of the river as soon as\nthe people saw what had happened. There were two camps of Sioux, the\nBlackfoot Sioux and the Yanktonnais, or our people. Of course the\nMandans and Rees greatly outnumbered us; their camp must have numbered\ntwo or three thousand, which was more than we had in our combined camps.\n\n“There was a Sioux whose name was Black Shield, who had intermarried\namong the Rees. He came down to the opposite bank of the Missouri and\nshouted to us:\n\n“‘Of which one of your bands is the man who killed Bald Eagle?’\n\n“One of the Blackfoot Sioux replied:\n\n“‘It is a man of the Yanktonnais Sioux who killed Bald Eagle.’\n\n“Then he said: ‘The Rees wish to do battle with them; you had better\nwithdraw from their camp.’\n\n“Accordingly the Blackfeet retired about a mile from us upon the bluffs\nand pitched their tents, while the Yanktonnais remained on the flats.\nThe two bands had been great rivals in courage and the art of war, so\nwe did not ask for help from our kinsfolk, but during the night we dug\ntrenches about the camp, the inner one for the women and children, and\nthe outer one for the men to stay in and do battle.\n\n“The next morning at daybreak the enemy landed and approached our camp\nin great numbers. Some of their women and old men came also, and sat\nupon the bluffs to watch the fight and to carry off their dead and\nwounded. The Blackfeet likewise were watching the battle from the\nbluffs, and just before the fight began one Blackfoot came in with his\nwife and joined us. His name was Red Dog’s Track, but from that day he\nwas called He-Came-Back. His wife was a Yanktonnais, and he had said to\nher: ‘If I don’t join your tribe to-day, my brothers-in-law will call me\na coward.’\n\n“The Sioux were well entrenched and well armed with guns and arrows,\nand their aim was deadly, so that the Rees crawled up gradually and took\nevery opportunity to pick off any Sioux who ventured to show his head\nabove the trenches. In like manner every Ree who exposed himself was\nsure to die.\n\n“Up to this time no one had seen the two men who made all the trouble.\nThere was a natural hollow in the bank, concealed by buffalo berry\nbushes, very near where they stood when Bald Eagle shot the Ree.\n\n“‘Friend,’ said Big Whip, ‘it is likely that our own people will punish\nus for this deed. They will pursue and kill us wherever they find us.\nThey have the right to do this. The best thing is to drop into this\nwashout and remain there until they cease to look for us.’\n\n“They did so, and remained hidden during the night. But, after the fight\nbegan, Big Whip said again: ‘Friend, we are the cause of the deaths of\nmany brave men this day. We committed the act to show our bravery. We\ndared each other to do it. It will now become us as warriors to join our\nband.’\n\n“They both stripped, and taking their weapons in hand, ran toward the\ncamp. They had to pass directly through the enemy’s lines, but they were\nnot recognized till they had fairly passed them. Then they were between\ntwo fires. When they had almost reached the entrenchment they faced\nabout and fired at the Rees, jumping about incessantly to avoid being\nhit, as is the Indian fashion. Bullets and arrows were flying all about\nthem like hail, but at last they dropped back unhurt into the Sioux\ntrenches. Thus the two men saved their reputation for bravery, and their\npeople never openly reproached them for the events of that day. Young\nmen are often rash, but it is not well to reprove one for a brave deed\nlest he become a coward.\n\n“Many were killed, but more of the Rees than of our band. About the\nmiddle of the afternoon there came a cold rain. It was in the fall of\nthe year. The bow-strings were wet, and the guns were only flint-locks.\nYou know when the flint becomes wet it is useless, and it looked as if\nthe fight must be with knives.\n\n“But the Rees were much disheartened. They had lost many. The women\nwere all the time carrying off the wounded, and there were the Blackfoot\nSioux watching them from the hills. They turned and fled toward the\nriver. The Sioux followed like crazy wolves, tomahawking the tired and\nslow ones. Many were killed at the boats, and some of the boats were\npunctured with shot and sank. Some carried a load of Sioux arrows back\nacross the river. That was the greatest battle ever fought by our band,”\n the old man concluded, with a deep sigh of mingled satisfaction and\nregret.\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE SINGING SPIRIT\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n“Ho my steed, we must climb one more hill! My reputation depends upon my\nreport!”\n\nAnookasan addressed his pony as if he were a human companion, urged on\nlike himself by human need and human ambition. And yet in his heart he\nhad very little hope of sighting any buffalo in that region at just that\ntime of the year.\n\nThe Yankton Sioux were ordinarily the most far-sighted of their people\nin selecting a winter camp, but this year the late fall had caught them\nrather far east of the Missouri bottoms, their favorite camping-ground.\nThe upper Jim River, called by the Sioux the River of Gray Woods, was\nusually bare of large game at that season. Their store of jerked buffalo\nmeat did not hold out as they had hoped, and by March it became an\nurgent necessity to send out scouts for buffalo.\n\nThe old men at the tiyo teepee (council lodge) held a long council. It\nwas decided to select ten of their bravest and hardiest young men to\nexplore the country within three days’ journey of their camp.\n\n“Anookasan, uyeyo-o-o, woo, woo!” Thus the ten men were summoned to\nthe council lodge early in the evening to receive their commission.\nAnookasan was the first called and first to cross the circle of the\nteepees. A young man of some thirty years, of the original native\ntype, his massive form was wrapped in a fine buffalo robe with the hair\ninside. He wore a stately eagle feather in his scalp-lock, but no paint\nabout his face.\n\nAs he entered the lodge all the inmates greeted him with marked respect,\nand he was given the place of honor. When all were seated the great\ndrum was struck and a song sung by four deep-chested men. This was the\nprelude to a peculiar ceremony.\n\nA large red pipe, which had been filled and laid carefully upon the\ncentral hearth, was now taken up by an old man, whose face was painted\nred. First he held it to the ground with the words: “Great Mother,\npartake of this!” Then he held it toward the sky, saying: “Great Father,\nsmoke this!” Finally he lighted it, took four puffs, pointing it to the\nfour corners of the earth in turn, and lastly presented it to Anookasan.\nThis was the oath of office, administered by the chief of the council\nlodge. The other nine were similarly commissioned, and all accepted the\nappointment.\n\nIt was no light task that was thus religiously enjoined upon these\nten men. It meant at the least several days and nights of wandering\nin search of signs of the wily buffalo. It was a public duty, and a\npersonal one as well; one that must involve untold hardship; and if\novertaken by storm the messengers were in peril of death!\n\nAnookasan returned to his teepee with some misgiving. His old charger,\nwhich had so often carried him to victory, was not so strong as he had\nbeen in his prime. As his master approached the lodge the old horse\nwelcomed him with a gentle whinny. He was always tethered near by, ready\nfor any emergency.\n\n“Ah, Wakan! we are once more called upon to do duty! We shall set out\nbefore daybreak.”\n\nAs he spoke, he pushed nearer a few strips of the poplar bark, which was\noats to the Indian pony of the olden time.\n\nAnookasan had his extra pair of buffaloskin moccasins with the hair\ninside, and his scanty provision of dried meat neatly done up in a\nsmall packet and fastened to his saddle. With his companions he started\nnorthward, up the River of the Gray Woods, five on the east side and a\nlike number on the west.\n\nThe party had separated each morning, so as to cover as much ground as\npossible, having agreed to return at night to the river. It was now the\nthird day; their food was all but gone, their steeds much worn, and the\nsigns seemed to indicate a storm. Yet the hunger of their friends and\ntheir own pride impelled them to persist, for out of many young men\nthey had been chosen, therefore they must prove themselves equal to the\noccasion.\n\nThe sun, now well toward the western horizon, cast over snow-covered\nplains a purplish light. No living creature was in sight and the quest\nseemed hopeless, but Anookasan was not one to accept defeat.\n\n“There may be an outlook from yonder hill which will turn failure into\nsuccess,” he thought, as he dug his heels into the sides of his faithful\nnag. At the same time he started a “Strong Heart” song to keep his\ncourage up!\n\nAt the summit of the ascent he paused and gazed steadily before him. At\nthe foot of the next coteau he beheld a strip of black. He strained his\neyes to look, for the sun had already set behind the hilltops. It was\na great herd of buffaloes, he thought, which was grazing on the\nfoot-hills.\n\n“Hi hi, uncheedah! Hi, hi, tunkasheedah!” he was about to exclaim in\ngratitude, when, looking more closely, he discovered his mistake. The\ndark patch was only timber.\n\nHis horse could not carry him any further, so he got off and ran behind\nhim toward the river. At dusk he hailed his companions.\n\n“Ho, what success?” one cried.\n\n“Not a sign of even a lone bull,” replied another.\n\n“Yet I saw a gray wolf going north this evening. His direction is\npropitious,” remarked Anookasan, as he led the others down the slope and\ninto the heavy timber. The river just here made a sharp turn, forming a\ndensely wooded semicircle, in the shelter of a high bluff.\n\nThe braves were all downhearted because of their ill-luck, and only the\nsanguine spirit of Anookasan kept them from utter discouragement. Their\nslight repast had been taken and each man had provided himself with\nabundance of dry grass and twigs for a bed. They had built a temporary\nwigwam of the same material, in the center of which there was a generous\nfire. Each man stretched himself out upon his robe in the glow of it.\nAnookasan filled the red pipe, and, having lighted it, he took one or\ntwo hasty puffs and held it up to the moon, which was scarcely visible\nbehind the cold clouds.\n\n“Great Mother, partake of this smoke! May I eat meat to-morrow!” he\nexclaimed with solemnity. Having uttered this prayer, he handed the pipe\nto the man nearest him.\n\nFor a time they all smoked in silence; then came a distant call.\n\n“Ah, it is Shunkmanito, the wolf! There is something cheering in his\nvoice to-night,” declared Anookasan. “Yes, I am sure he is telling us\nnot to be discouraged. You know that the wolf is one of our best friends\nin trouble. Many a one has been guided back to his home by him in a\nblizzard, or led to game when in desperate need. My friends, let us not\nturn back in the morning; let us go north one more day!”\n\nNo one answered immediately, and again silence reigned, while one by one\nthey pulled the reluctant whiffs of smoke through the long stem of the\ncalumet.\n\n“What is that?” said one of the men, and all listened intently to catch\nthe delicate sound. They were familiar with all the noises of the night\nand voices of the forest, but this was not like any of them.\n\n“It sounds like the song of a mosquito, and one might forget while he\nlistens that this is not midsummer,” said one.\n\n“I hear also the medicine-man’s single drumbeat,” suggested another.\n\n“There is a tradition,” remarked Anookasan, that many years ago a party\nof hunters went up the river on a scout like this of ours. They never\nreturned. Afterward, in the summer, their bones were found near the home\nof a strange creature, said to be a little man, but he had hair all over\nhim. The Isantees call him Chanotedah. Our old men give him the name\nOglugechana. This singular being is said to be no larger than a new-born\nbabe. He speaks an unknown tongue.\n\n“The home of Oglugechana is usually a hollow stump, around which all of\nthe nearest trees are felled by lightning. There is an open spot in the\ndeep woods wherever he dwells. His weapons are the plumes of various\nbirds. Great numbers of these variegated feathers are to be found in the\ndeserted lodge of the little man.\n\n“It is told by the old men that Oglugechana has a weird music by which\nhe sometimes bewitches lone travelers. He leads them hither and thither\nabout his place until they have lost their senses. Then he speaks to\nthem. He may make of them great war-prophets or medicinemen, but his\ncommands are hard to fulfill. If any one sees him and comes away before\nhe is bewildered, the man dies as soon as he smells the camp-fire, or\nwhen he enters his home his nearest relative dies suddenly.”\n\nThe warrior who related this legend assumed the air of one who narrates\nauthentic history, and his listeners appeared to be seriously impressed.\nWhat we call the supernatural was as real to them as any part of their\nlives.\n\n“This thing does not stop to breathe at all. His music seems to go on\nendlessly,” said one, with considerable uneasiness.\n\n“It comes from the heavy timber north of us, under the high cliff,”\n reported a warrior who had stepped outside of the rude temporary\nstructure to inform himself more clearly of the direction of the sound.\n\n“Anookasan, you are our leader--tell us what we should do! We will\nfollow you. I believe we ought to leave this spot immediately. This is\nperhaps the spirit of some dead enemy,” suggested another. Meanwhile,\nthe red pipe was refilled and sent around the circle to calm their\ndisturbed spirits.\n\nWhen the calumet returned at last to the one addressed, he took it in a\npreoccupied manner, and spoke between labored pulls on the stem.\n\n“I am just like yourselves--nothing more than flesh--with a spirit that\nis as ready to leave me as water to run from a punctured water-bag! When\nwe think thus, we are weak. Let us rather think upon the brave deeds\nof our ancestors! This singing spirit has a gentle voice; I am ready to\nfollow and learn if it be an enemy or no. Let us all be found together\nnext summer if need be!”\n\n“Ho, ho, ho!” was the full-throated response.\n\n“All put on your war-paint,” suggested Anookasan. “Have your knives and\narrows ready!”\n\nThey did so, and all stole silently through the black forest in the\ndirection of the mysterious sound. Clearer and clearer it came through\nthe frosty air; but it was a foreign sound to the savage ear. Now it\nseemed to them almost like a distant water-fall; then it recalled the\nlow hum of summer insects and the drowsy drone of the bumblebee. Thump,\nthump, thump! was the regular accompaniment.\n\nNearer and nearer to the cliff they came, deeper into the wild heart\nof the woods. At last out of the gray, formless night a dark shape\nappeared! It looked to them like a huge buffalo bull standing motionless\nin the forest, and from his throat there apparently proceeded the thump\nof the medicine drum, and the song of the beguiling spirit!\n\nAll of a sudden a spark went up into the air. As they continued to\napproach, there became visible a deep glow about the middle of the dark\nobject. Whatever it was, they had never heard of anything like it in all\ntheir lives!\n\nAnookasan was a little in advance of his companions, and it was he who\nfinally discovered a wall of logs laid one upon another. Half way up\nthere seemed to be stretched a par-fleche (raw-hide), from which a dim\nlight emanated. He still thought of Oglugechana, who dwells within a\nhollow tree, and determined to surprise and if possible to overpower\nthis wonderworking old man.\n\nAll now took their knives in their hands and advanced with their leader\nto the attack upon the log hut. “Wa-wa-wa-wa, woo, woo!” they cried.\nZip, zip! went the par-fleche door and window, and they all rushed in!\n\nThere sat a man upon a roughly hewn stool. He was attired in wolfskins\nand wore a foxskin cap upon his head. The larger portion of his face was\nclothed with natural fur. A rudely made cedar fiddle was tucked\nunder his furred chin. Supporting it with his left hand, he sawed it\nvigorously with a bow that was not unlike an Indian boy’s miniature\nweapon, while his moccasined left foot came down upon the sod floor in\ntime with the music. When the shrill war-whoop came, and the door and\nwindow were cut in strips by the knives of the Indians, he did not even\ncease playing, but instinctively he closed his eyes, so as not to behold\nthe horror of his own end.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nIt was long ago, upon the rolling prairie south of the Devil’s Lake,\nthat a motley body of hunters gathered near a mighty herd of the bison,\nin the Moon of Falling Leaves. These were the first generation of the\nCanadian mixed-bloods, who sprang up in such numbers as to form almost\na new people. These semi-wild Americans soon became a necessity to the\nHudson Bay Company, as they were the greatest hunters of the bison,\nand made more use of this wonderful animal than even their aboriginal\nancestors.\n\nA curious race of people this, in their make-up and their customs! Their\nshaggy black hair was allowed to grow long, reaching to their broad\nshoulders, then cut off abruptly, making their heads look like a\nthatched house. Their dark faces were in most cases well covered with\nhair, their teeth large and white, and their eyes usually liquid black,\nalthough occasionally one had a tiger-brown or cold-gray eye. Their\ncostume was a buckskin shirt with abundance of fringes, buckskin\npantaloons with short leggins, a gay sash, and a cap of fox-fur. Their\narms consisted of flint-lock guns, hatchets, and butcher-knives. Their\nponies were small, but as hardy as themselves.\n\nAs these men gathered in the neighborhood of an immense herd of\nbuffaloes, they busied themselves in adjusting the girths of their\nbeautifully beaded pillow-like saddles. Among them there were\nexceptional riders and hunters. It was said that few could equal Antoine\nMichaud in feats of riding into and through the herd. There he stood,\nall alone, the observed of many others. It was his habit to give several\nIndian yells when the onset began, so as to insure a successful hunt.\n\nIn this instance, Antoine gave his usual whoops, and when they had\nalmost reached the herd, he lifted his flint-lock over his head and\nplunged into the black moving mass. With a sound like the distant\nrumbling of thunder, those tens of thousands of buffalo hoofs were\npounding the earth in retreat. Thus Antoine disappeared!\n\nHis wild steed dashed into the midst of the vast herd. Fortunately for\nhim, the animals kept clear of him; but alas! the gap through which he\nhad entered instantly closed again.\n\nHe yelled frantically to secure an outlet, but without effect. He had\ntied a red bandanna around his head to keep the hair off his face,\nand he now took this off and swung it crazily about him to scatter the\nbuffalo, but it availed him nothing.\n\nWith such a mighty herd in flight, the speed could not be great;\ntherefore the “Bois Brule” settled himself to the situation, allowing\nhis pony to canter along slowly to save his strength. It required much\ntact and presence of mind to keep an open space, for the few paces of\nobstruction behind had gradually grown into a mile.\n\nThe mighty host moved continually southward, walking and running\nalternately. As the sun neared the western horizon, it fired the sky\nabove them, and all the distant hills and prairies were in the glow of\nit, but immediately about them was a thick cloud of dust, and the ground\nappeared like a fire-swept plain.\n\nSuddenly Antoine was aware of a tremendous push from behind. The animals\nsmelled the cool water of a spring which formed a large bog in the midst\nof the plain. This solitary pond or marsh was a watering-place for the\nwild animals. All pushed and edged toward it; it was impossible for any\none to withstand the combined strength of so many.\n\nAntoine and his steed were in imminent danger of being pushed into\nthe mire and trampled upon, but a mere chance brought them upon solid\nground. As they were crowded across the marsh, his pony drank heartily,\nand he, for the first time, let go his bridle, put his two palms\ntogether for a dipper, and drank greedily of the bitter water. He had\nnot eaten since early morning, so he now pulled up some bulrushes and\nate of the tender bulbs, while the pony grazed as best he could on the\ntops of the tall grass.\n\nIt was now dark. The night was wellnigh intolerable for Antoine. The\nbuffalo were about him in countless numbers, regarding him with vicious\nglances. It was only by reason of the natural offensiveness of man that\nthey gave him any space. The bellowing of the bulls became general, and\nthere was a marked uneasiness on the part of the herd. This was a\nsign of approaching storm, therefore the unfortunate hunter had this\nadditional cause for anxiety. Upon the western horizon were seen some\nflashes of lightning.\n\nThe cloud which had been a mere speck upon the horizon had now increased\nto large proportions. Suddenly the wind came, and lightning flashes\nbecame more frequent, showing the ungainly forms of the animals like\nstrange monsters in the white light. The colossal herd was again in\nviolent motion. It was a blind rush for shelter, and no heed was paid\nto buffalo wallows or even deep gulches. All was in the deepest of\ndarkness. There seemed to be groaning in heaven and earth--millions of\nhoofs and throats roaring in unison!\n\nAs a shipwrecked man clings to a mere fragment of wood, so Antoine,\nalthough almost exhausted with fatigue, still stuck to the back of his\nequally plucky pony. Death was imminent for them both. As the mad rush\ncontinued, every flash displayed heaps of bison in death struggle under\nthe hoofs of their companions.\n\nFrom time to time Antoine crossed himself and whispered a prayer to the\nVirgin; and again he spoke to his horse after the fashion of an Indian:\n\n“Be brave, be strong, my horse! If we survive this trial, you shall have\ngreat honor!”\n\nThe stampede continued until they reached the bottom lands, and, like\na rushing stream, their course was turned aside by the steep bank of\na creek or small river. Then they moved more slowly in wide sweeps or\ncircles, until the storm ceased, and the exhausted hunter, still in his\nsaddle, took some snatches of sleep.\n\nWhen he awoke and looked about him again it was morning. The herd had\nentered the strip of timber which lay on both sides of the river, and\nit was here that Antoine conceived his first distinct hope of saving\nhimself.\n\n“Waw, waw, waw!” was the hoarse cry that came to his ears, apparently\nfrom a human being in distress. Antoine strained his eyes and craned his\nneck to see who it could be. Through an opening in the branches ahead he\nperceived a large grizzly bear, lying along an inclined limb and hugging\nit desperately to maintain his position. The herd had now thoroughly\npervaded the timber, and the bear was likewise hemmed in. He had taken\nto his unaccustomed refuge after making a brave stand against several\nbulls, one of which lay dead near by, while he himself was bleeding from\nmany wounds.\n\nAntoine had been assiduously looking for a friendly tree, by means of\nwhich he hoped to effect his escape from captivity by the army of bison.\nHis horse, by chance, made his way directly under the very box-elder\nthat was sustaining the bear and there was a convenient branch just\nwithin his reach. The Bois Brule was not then in an aggressive mood,\nand he saw at a glance that the occupant of the tree would not interfere\nwith him. They were, in fact, companions in distress. Antoine tried\nto give a war-whoop as he sprang desperately from the pony’s back and\nseized the cross limb with both his hands.\n\nThe hunter dangled in the air for a minute that to him seemed a year.\nThen he gathered up all the strength that was in him, and with one grand\neffort he pulled himself up on the limb.\n\nIf he had failed in this, he would have fallen to the ground under the\nhoofs of the buffaloes, and at their mercy.\n\nAfter he had adjusted his seat as comfortably as he could, Antoine\nsurveyed the situation. He had at least escaped from sudden and certain\ndeath. It grieved him that he had been forced to abandon his horse, and\nhe had no idea how far he had come nor any means of returning to his\nfriends, who had, no doubt, given him up for lost. His immediate needs\nwere rest and food.\n\nAccordingly he selected a fat cow and emptied into her sides one barrel\nof his gun, which had been slung across his chest. He went on shooting\nuntil he had killed many fat cows, greatly to the discomfiture of his\nneighbor, the bear, while the bison vainly struggled among themselves to\nkeep the fatal spot clear.\n\nBy the middle of the afternoon the main body of the herd had passed, and\nAntoine was sure that his captivity had at last come to an end. Then\nhe swung himself from his limb to the ground, and walked stiffly to\nthe carcass of the nearest cow, which he dressed and prepared himself a\nmeal. But first he took a piece of liver on a long pole to the bear!\n\nAntoine finally decided to settle in the recesses of the heavy timber\nfor the winter, as he was on foot and alone, and not able to travel any\ngreat distance. He jerked the meat of all the animals he had killed, and\nprepared their skins for bedding and clothing. The Bois Brule and Ami,\nas he called the bear, soon became necessary to one another. The former\nconsidered the bear very good company, and the latter had learned that\nman’s business, after all, is not to kill every animal he meets. He had\nbeen fed and kindly treated, when helpless from his wounds, and this he\ncould not forget.\n\nAntoine was soon busy erecting a small log hut, while the other partner\nkept a sharp lookout, and, after his hurts were healed, often brought in\nsome small game. The two had a perfect understanding without many words;\nat least, the speech was all upon one side! In his leisure moments\nAntoine had occupied himself with whittling out a rude fiddle of\ncedar-wood, strung with the guts of a wild cat that he had killed. Every\nevening that winter he would sit down after supper and play all the old\nfamiliar pieces, varied with improvisations of his own. At first, the\nmusic and the incessant pounding time with his foot annoyed the bear. At\ntimes, too, the Canadian would call out the figures for the dance. All\nthis Ami became accustomed to in time, and even showed no small interest\nin the buzzing of the little cedar box. Not infrequently, he was out\nin the evening, and the human partner was left alone. It chanced, quite\nfortunately, that the bear was absent on the night that the red folk\nrudely invaded the lonely hut.\n\nThe calmness of the strange being had stayed their hands. They had never\nbefore seen a man of other race than their own!\n\n“Is this Chanotedah? Is he man, or beast?” the warriors asked one\nanother.\n\n“Ho, wake up, koda!” exclaimed Anookasan. “Maybe he is of the porcupine\ntribe, ashamed to look at us!”\n\nAt this moment they spied the haunch of venison which swung from a\ncross-stick over a fine bed of coals, in front of the rude mud chimney.\n\n“Ho, koda has something to eat! Sit down, sit down!” they shouted to one\nanother.\n\nNow Antoine opened his eyes for the first time upon his unlooked-for\nguests. They were a haggard and hungry-looking set. Anookasan extended\nhis hand, and Antoine gave it a hearty shake. He set his fiddle against\nthe wall and began to cut up the smoking venison into generous pieces\nand place it before them. All ate like famished men, while the firelight\nintensified the red paint upon their wild and warlike faces.\n\nWhen he had satisfied his first hunger, Anookasan spoke in signs.\n“Friend, we have never before heard a song like that of your little\ncedar box! We had supposed it to be a spirit, or some harmful thing,\nhence our attack upon it. We never saw any people of your sort. What is\nyour tribe?”\n\nAntoine explained his plight in the same manner, and the two soon came\nto an understanding. The Canadian told the starving hunters of a buffalo\nherd a little way to the north, and one of their number was dispatched\nhomeward with the news. In two days the entire band reached Antoine’s\nplace. The Bois Brule was treated with kindness and honor, and the tribe\ngave him a wife. Suffice it to say that Antoine lived and died among the\nYanktons at a good old age; but Ami could not brook the invasion upon\ntheir hermit life. He was never seen after that first evening.\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE FAMINE\n\nOn the Assiniboine River in western Manitoba there stands an old,\nhistoric trading-post, whose crumbling walls crown a high promontory in\nthe angle formed by its junction with a tributary stream. This is Fort\nEllis, a mistress of the wilderness and lodestone of savage tribes\nbetween the years 1830 and 1870.\n\nHither at that early day the Indians brought their buffalo robes and\nbeaver skins to exchange for merchandise, ammunition, and the “spirit\nwater.” Among the others there presently appeared a band of renegade\nSioux--the exiles, as they called themselves--under White Lodge, whose\nfather, Little Crow, had been a leader in the outbreak of 1862. Now the\ngreat warchief was dead, and his people were prisoners or fugitives.\nThe shrewd Scotch trader, McLeod, soon discovered that the Sioux were\nskilled hunters, and therefore he exerted himself to befriend them,\nas well as to encourage a feeling of good will between them and the\nCanadian tribes who were accustomed to make the old fort their summer\nrendezvous.\n\nNow the autumn had come, after a long summer of feasts and dances, and\nthe three tribes broke up and dispersed as usual in various directions.\nWhite Lodge had twin daughters, very handsome, whose ears had been kept\nburning with the proposals of many suitors, but none had received any\ndefinite encouragement. There were one or two who would have been quite\nwilling to forsake their own tribes and follow the exiles had they\nnot feared too much the ridicule of the braves. Even Angus McLeod, the\ntrader’s eldest son, had need of all his patience and caution, for he\nhad never seen any woman he admired so much as the piquant Magaskawee,\ncalled The Swan, one of these belles of the forest.\n\nThe Sioux journeyed northward, toward the Mouse River. They had wintered\non that stream before, and it was then the feeding ground of large herds\nof buffalo. When it was discovered that the herds were moving westward,\nacross the Missouri, there was no little apprehension. The shrewd\nmedicine-man became aware of the situation, and hastened to announce his\nprophecy:\n\n“The Great Mystery has appeared to me in a dream! He showed me men with\nhaggard and thin faces. I interpret this to mean a scarcity of food\nduring the winter.”\n\nThe chief called his counselors together and set before them the dream\nof the priest, whose prophecy, he said, was already being fulfilled in\npart by the westward movement of the buffalo. It was agreed that they\nshould lay up all the dried meat they could obtain; but even for this\nthey were too late. The storms were already at hand, and that winter was\nmore severe than any that the old men could recall in their traditions.\nThe braves killed all the small game for a wide circuit around the camp,\nbut the buffalo had now crossed the river, and that country was not\nfavorable for deer. The more enterprising young men organized hunting\nexpeditions to various parts of the open prairie, but each time they\nreturned with empty hands.\n\nThe “Moon of Sore Eyes,” or March, had come at last, and Wazeah, the God\nof Storm, was still angry. Their scant provision of dried meat had held\nout wonderfully, but it was now all but consumed. The Sioux had but\nlittle ammunition, and the snow was still so deep that it was impossible\nfor them to move away to any other region in search of game. The worst\nwas feared; indeed, some of the children and feeble old people had\nalready succumbed.\n\nWhite Lodge again called his men together in council, and it was\ndetermined to send a messenger to Fort Ellis to ask for relief. A young\nman called Face-the-Wind was chosen for his exceptional qualities of\nspeed and endurance upon long journeys. The old medicine-man, whose\nshrewd prophecy had gained for him the confidence of the people, now\ncame forward. He had closely observed the appearance of the messenger\nselected, and had taken note of the storm and distance. Accordingly he\nsaid:\n\n“My children, the Great Mystery is offended, and this is the cause of\nall our suffering! I see a shadow hanging over our messenger, but I will\npray to the Great Spirit--perhaps he may yet save him!--Great Mystery,\nbe thou merciful! Strengthen this young man for his journey, that he\nmay be able to finish it and to send us aid! If we see the sun of summer\nagain, we will offer the choicest of our meats to thee, and do thee\ngreat honor!”\n\nDuring this invocation, as occasionally happens in March, a loud peal\nof thunder was heard. This coincidence threw the prophet almost into\na frenzy, and the poor people were all of a tremble. Face-the-Wind\nbelieved that the prayer was directly answered, and though weakened by\nfasting and unfit for the task before him, he was encouraged to make the\nattempt.\n\nHe set out on the following day at dawn, and on the third day staggered\ninto the fort, looking like a specter and almost frightening the people.\nHe was taken to McLeod’s house and given good care. The poor fellow,\ndelirious with hunger, fancied himself engaged in mortal combat with\nEyah, the god of famine, who has a mouth extending from ear to ear.\nWherever he goes there is famine, for he swallows all that he sees, even\nwhole nations!\n\nThe legend has it that Eyah fears nothing but the jingling of metal: so\nfinally the dying man looked up into McLeod’s face and cried: “Ring your\nbell in his face, Wahadah!”\n\n\nThe kind-hearted factor could not refuse, and as the great bell used to\nmark the hours of work and of meals pealed out untimely upon the frosty\nair, the Indian started up and in that moment breathed his last. He had\ngiven no news, and McLeod and his sons could only guess at the state of\naffairs upon the Mouse River.\n\nWhile the men were in council with her father, Magaskawee had turned\nover the contents of her work-bag. She had found a small roll of\nbirch-bark in which she kept her porcupine quills for embroidery, and\npulled the delicate layers apart. The White Swan was not altogether the\nuntutored Indian maiden, for she had lived in the family of a missionary\nin the States, and had learned both to speak and write some English.\nThere was no ink, no pen or pencil, but with her bone awl she pressed\nupon the white side of the bark the following words:\n\n   MR. ANGUS McLEOD:--\n\n   We are near the hollow rock on the Mouse River. The\n   buffalo went away across the Missouri, and our powder and\n   shot are gone. We are starving. Good-bye, if I don’t see\n   you again.\n\n   MAGASKAWEE.\n\n\nThe girl entrusted this little note to her grandmother, and she in turn\ngave it to the messenger. But he, as we know, was unable to deliver it.\n\n“Angus, tell the boys to bury the poor fellow to-morrow. I dare say\nhe brought us some news from White Lodge, but we have got to go to the\nhappy hunting-grounds to get it, or wait till the exile band returns in\nthe spring. Evidently,” continued McLeod, “he fell sick on the way: or\nelse he was starving!”\n\nThis last suggestion horrified Angus. “I believe, father,” he exclaimed,\n“that we ought to examine his bundle.”\n\nA small oblong packet was brought forth from the dead man’s belt and\ncarefully unrolled.\n\nThere were several pairs of moccasins, and within one of these Angus\nfound something wrapped up nicely. He proceeded to unwind the long\nstrings of deerskin with which it was securely tied, and brought forth a\nthin sheet of birch-bark. At first, there seemed to be nothing more,\nbut a closer scrutiny revealed the impression of the awl, and the bit\nof nature’s parchment was brought nearer to his face, and scanned with a\nzeal equal to that of any student of ancient hieroglyphics.\n\n“This tells the whole story, father!” exclaimed the young man at last.\n“Magaskawee’s note--just listen!” and he read it aloud. “I shall start\nto-morrow. We can take enough provision and ammunition on two sleds,\nwith six dogs to each. I shall want three good men to go with me.” Angus\nspoke with decision.\n\n“Well, we can’t afford to lose our best hunters; and you might also\nbring home with you what furs and robes they have on hand,” was his\nfather’s prudent reply.\n\n“I don’t care particularly for the skins,” Angus declared; but he at\nonce began hurried preparations for departure.\n\nIn the meantime affairs grew daily more desperate in the exile village\non the far-away Mouse River, and a sort of Indian hopelessness and\nresignation settled down upon the little community. There were few who\nreally expected their messenger to reach the fort, or believed that even\nif he did so, relief would be sent in time to save them. White Lodge,\nthe father of his people, was determined to share with them the last\nmouthful of food, and every morning Winona and Magaskawee went with\nscanty portions in their hands to those whose supply had entirely\nfailed.\n\nOn the outskirts of the camp there dwelt an old woman with an orphan\ngrandchild, who had been denying herself for some time in order that the\nchild might live longer. This poor teepee the girls visited often, and\none on each side they raised the exhausted woman and poured into her\nmouth the warm broth they had brought with them.\n\nIt was on the very day Face-the-Wind reached Fort Ellis that a young\nhunter who had ventured further from the camp than any one else had\nthe luck to bring down a solitary deer with his bow and arrow. In his\nweakness he had reached camp very late, bearing the deer with the utmost\ndifficulty upon his shoulders. It was instantly separated into as many\npieces as there were lodges of the famishing Sioux. These delicious\nmorsels were hastily cooked and eagerly devoured, but among so many\nthere was scarcely more than a mouthful to the share of each, and the\nbrave youth himself did not receive enough to appease in the least his\ncraving!\n\nOn the eve of Angus’ departure for the exile village, Three Stars, a\ndevoted suitor of Winona’s, accompanied by another Assiniboine brave,\nappeared unexpectedly at the fort. He at once asked permission to join\nthe relief party, and they set out at daybreak.\n\nThe lead-dog was the old reliable Mack, who had been in service for\nseveral seasons on winter trips. All of the white men were clad in\nbuckskin shirts and pantaloons, with long fringes down the sides, fur\ncaps and fur-lined moccasins. Their guns were fastened to the long,\ntoboggan-like sleds.\n\nThe snow had thawed a little and formed an icy crust, and over this\nfresh snow had fallen, which a northwest wind swept over the surface\nlike ashes after a prairie fire. The sun appeared for a little time in\nthe morning, but it seemed as if he were cutting short his course on\naccount of the bleak day, and had protected himself with pale rings of\nfire.\n\nThe dogs laid back their ears, drew in their tails, and struck into\ntheir customary trot, but even old Mack looked back frequently, as if\nreluctant to face such a pricking and scarifying wind. The men felt the\ncold still more keenly, although they had taken care to cover every bit\nof the face except one eye, and that was completely blinded at times by\nthe granulated snow.\n\nThe sun early retreated behind a wall of cloud, and the wind moaned and\nwailed like a living creature in anguish. At last they approached the\ncreek where they had planned to camp for the night. There was nothing\nto be seen but a few stunted willows half buried in the drifts, but the\nbanks of the little stream afforded some protection from the wind.\n\n“Whoa!” shouted the leader, and the dogs all stopped, sitting down on\ntheir haunches. “Come, Mack!” (with a wave of the hand), “lead your\nfellows down to the creek!”\n\nThe old dog started down at the word, and all the rest followed. A\nspace was quickly cleared of snow, while one man scoured the thickets\nin search of brush for fuel. In a few minutes the tent was up and a fire\nkindled in the center, while the floor was thickly strewn with twigs of\nwillow, over which buffalo robes were spread. Three Stars attended to\nsupper, and soon in the midst of the snapping willow fire a kettle was\nboiling. All partook of strong tea, dried meat of buffalo, and pemmican,\na mixture of pounded dried meat with wild cherries and melted fat. The\ndogs, to whom one-half the tent was assigned, enjoyed a hearty meal and\nfell into a deep sleep, lying one against another.\n\nAfter supper Jerry drove two sticks into the ground, one on each side of\nthe fire, and connected the two by a third one over the blaze. Upon\nthis all hung their socks to dry--most of them merely square pieces of\nblanket cut to serve that purpose. Soon each man rolled himself in his\nown buffalo robe and fell asleep.\n\nAll night the wind raged. The lonely teepee now and then shuddered\nviolently, as a stronger blast than usual almost lifted it from the\nground. No one stirred except from time to time one of the dogs, who\ngot up snarling and sniffing the cold air, turned himself round several\ntimes as if on a pivot, and finally lay down for another nap.\n\nIn the morning the travelers one by one raised their heads and looked\nthrough the smoke-hole, then fell back again with a grunt. All the world\nappeared without form and void. Presently, however, the light of the sun\nwas seen as if through a painted window, and by afternoon they were able\nto go on, the wind having partially subsided. This was only a taste of\nthe weather encountered by the party on their unseasonable trip; but had\nit been ten times harder, it would never have occurred to Angus to turn\nback.\n\nOn the third day the rescuers approached the camp of the exiles. There\nwas an ominous quiet; no creature was to be seen; but the smoke which\nascended into the air in perpendicular columns assured them that some,\nat least, were still alive. The party happened to reach first the teepee\nof the poor old woman who had been so faithfully ministered to by the\ntwin sisters. They had no longer any food to give, but they had come to\nbuild her fire, if she should have survived the night. At the very door\nof the lodge they heard the jingle of dog-bells, but they had not time\nto announce the joyful news before the men were in sight.\n\nIn another minute Angus and Three Stars were beside them, holding their\nwasted hands.\n\n\n\n\nV. THE CHIEF SOLDIER\n\nJust outside of a fine large wigwam of smoke-tanned buffalo-skins stood\nTawasuota, very early upon an August morning of the year 1862. Behind\nthe wigwam there might have been seen a thrifty patch of growing\nmaize, whose tall, graceful stalks resembled as many warriors in\ndancing-dresses and tasseled head-gear.\n\n“Thanks be to the ‘Great Mystery,’ I have been successful in the\nfortunes of war! None can say that Tawasuota is a coward. I have done\nwell; so well that our chief, Little Crow, has offered me the honored\nposition of his chief soldier, ta akich-itah!” he said to himself with\nsatisfaction.\n\nThe sun was just over the eastem bank of the Minnesota River, and he\ncould distinctly see upon the level prairie the dwellings of logs which\nhad sprung up there during the year, since Little Crow’s last treaty\nwith the whites. “Ugh! they are taking from us our beautiful and\ngame-teeming country!” was his thought as he gazed upon them.\n\nAt that moment, out of the conical white teepee, in shape like a\nnew-born mushroom, there burst two little frisky boys, leaping and\nwhooping. They were clad gracefully in garments of fine deerskin, and\neach wore a miniature feather upon his head, marking them as children of\na distinguished warrior.\n\nThey danced nimbly around their father, while he stood with all the\ndignity of a buck elk, viewing the landscape reddened by sunrise and the\ndwellers therein, the old and the new, the red and the white. He noticed\nthat they were still unmingled; the river divided them.\n\nAt last he took the dancing little embryo warriors one in either hand,\nand lifted them to his majestic shoulders. There he placed them\nin perfect poise. His haughty spirit found a moment’s happiness in\nfatherhood.\n\nSuddenly Tawasuota set the two boys on the ground again, and signed\nto them to enter the teepee. Apparently all was quiet. The camps and\nvillages of the Minnesota reservation were undisturbed, so far as he\ncould see, save by the awakening of nature; and the early risers among\nhis people moved about in seeming security, while the smoke of their\nmorning fires arose one by one into the blue. Still the warrior gazed\nsteadily westward, up the river, whence his quick ear had caught the\nfaint but ominous sound of a distant war-whoop.\n\nThe ridge beyond the Wahpeton village bounded the view, and between this\npoint and his own village were the agency buildings and the traders’\nstores. The Indian’s keen eye swept the horizon, and finally alighted\nonce more upon the home of his new neighbor across the river, the\nflaxen-haired white man with many children, who with his white squaw\nand his little ones worked from sunrise to sunset, much like the beaver\nfamily.\n\nAh! the distant war-whoop once more saluted his ear, but this time\nnearer and more distinct.\n\n“What! the Rice Creek band is coming in full war-paint! Can it be\nanother Ojibway attack? Ugh, ugh! I will show their warriors again this\nday what it is to fight!” he exclaimed aloud.\n\nThe white traders and Government employees, those of them who were up\nand about, heard and saw the advancing column of warriors. Yet they\nshowed no sign of anxiety or fear. Most of them thought that there might\nbe some report of Ojibways coming to attack the Sioux,--a not uncommon\nincident,--and that those warriors were on their way to the post to\nreplenish their powder-horns. A few of the younger men were delighted\nwith the prospect of witnessing an Indian fight.\n\nOn swept the armed band, in numbers increasing at every village.\n\nIt was true that there had been a growing feeling of distrust among the\nIndians, because their annuities had been withheld for a long time, and\nthe money payments had been delayed again and again. There were many in\ngreat need. The traders had given them credit to some extent (charging\nthem four times the value of the article purchased), and had likewise\ninduced Little Crow to sign over to them ninety-eight thousand dollars,\nthe purchase-price of that part of their reservation lying north of the\nMinnesota, and already occupied by the whites.\n\nThis act had made the chief very unpopular, and he was ready for a\ndesperate venture to regain his influence. Certain warriors among the\nupper bands of Sioux had even threatened his life, but no one spoke\nopenly of a break with the whites.\n\nWhen, therefore, the news came to Little Crow that some roving hunters\nof the Rice Creek band had killed in a brawl two families of white\nsettlers, he saw his opportunity to show once for all to the disaffected\nthat he had no love for the white man. Immediately he sprang upon his\nwhite horse, and prepared to make their cause a general one among his\npeople.\n\nTawasuota had scarcely finished his hasty preparations for war, by\npainting his face and seeing to the loading of his gun, when he heard\nthe voice of Little Crow outside his lodge.\n\n“You are now my head soldier,” said the chief, “and this is your first\nduty. Little Six and his band have inaugurated the war against the\nwhites. They have already wiped out two families, and are now on their\nway to the agency. Let my chief soldier fire the first shot.\n\n“Those Indians who have cut their hair and donned the white man’s\nclothing may give the warning; so make haste! If you fall to-day, there\nis no better day on which to die, and the women of our tribe will weep\nproud tears for Tawasuota. I leave it with you to lead my warriors.”\n With these words the wily chief galloped away to meet the war-party.\n\n“Here comes Little Crow, the friend of the white man!” exclaimed a\nwarrior, as he approached.\n\n“Friends and warriors, you will learn to-day who are the friends of\nthe white man, and none will dare again to insinuate that I have been\nagainst the interests of my own people,” he replied.\n\nAfter a brief consultation with the chiefs he advised the traders:\n\n“Do not hesitate to fill the powder-horns of my warriors; they may be\ncompelled to fight all day.”\n\nSoon loud yells were heard along the road to the Indian village.\n\n“Ho, ho! Tawasuota u ye do!” (“He is coming; he is coming!”) shouted the\nwarriors in chorus.\n\nThe famous war-chief dismounted in silence, gun in hand, and walked\ndirectly toward the larger store.\n\n“Friend,” he exclaimed, “we may both meet the ‘Great Mystery’ to-day,\nbut you must go first.”\n\nThere was a loud report, and the unsuspecting white man lay dead. It was\nJames Lynd, one of the early traders, and a good friend to the Indians.\n\nNo sooner had Tawasuota fired the fatal shot than every other Indian\ndischarged his piece. Hither and thither ran the frantic people, seeking\nsafety, but seeking it in vain. They were wholly unprepared and at the\nmercy of the foe.\n\nThe friendly Indians, too, were taken entirely by surprise. They had\noften heard wild talk of revolt, but it had never had the indorsement of\nintelligent chiefs, or of such a number as to carry any weight to their\nminds. Christian Indians rushed in every direction to save, if possible,\nat least the wives and children of the Government employees. Meanwhile,\nthe new white settlements along the Minnesota River were utterly\nunconscious of any danger. Not a soul dreamed of the terrible calamity\nthat each passing moment was bringing nearer and nearer.\n\nTawasuota stepped aside, and took up his pipe. He seemed almost\noblivious of what he had done. While the massacre still raged about\nhim in all its awful cruelty, he sat smoking and trying to think\ncollectedly, but his mind was confused, and in his secret thoughts he\nrebelled against Little Crow. It was a cowardly deed that he had been\nordered to commit, he thought; for he had won his reputation solely by\nbrave deeds in battle, and this was more like murdering one of his own\ntribesmen--this killing of an unarmed white man. Up to this time the\nkilling of a white man was not counted the deed of a warrior; it was\nmurder.\n\nThe lesser braves might now satisfy their spite against the traders to\ntheir hearts’ content, but Tawasuota had been upon the best of terms\nwith all of them.\n\nSuddenly a ringing shout was heard. The chief soldier looked up, and\nbeheld a white man, nearly nude, leap from the roof of the larger store\nand alight upon the ground hard by him.\n\nHe had emptied one barrel of his gun, and, if he chose to do so, could\nhave killed Myrick then and there; but he made no move, exclaiming:\n\n“Ho, ho! Nina iyaye!” (“Run, run!”)\n\nAway sped the white man in the direction of the woods and the river.\n\n“Ah, he is swift; he will save himself,” thought Tawasuota.\n\nAll the Indians had now spied the fugitive; they yelled and fired at him\nagain and again, as if they were shooting at a running deer; but he\nonly ran faster. Just as he had reached the very edge of the sheltering\ntimber a single shot rang out, and he fell headlong.\n\nA loud war-whoop went up, for many believed that this was one of the men\nwho had stolen their trust funds.\n\nTawasuota continued to sit and smoke in the shade while the carnage and\nplunder that he had set on foot proceeded on all sides of him. Presently\nmen began to form small parties to cross the river on their mission of\ndeath, but he refused to join any of them. At last, several of the older\nwarriors came up to smoke with him.\n\n“Ho, nephew,” said one of them with much gravity, “you have precipitated\na dreadful calamity. This means the loss of our country, the destruction\nof our nation. What were you thinking of?”\n\nIt was the Wahpeton chief who spoke, a blood-relation to Tawasuota. He\ndid not at once reply, but filled his pipe in silence, and handed it\nto the man who thus reproached him. It was a just rebuke; for he was a\nbrave man, and he could have refused the request of his chief to open\nthe massacre.\n\nAt this moment it was announced that a body of white soldiers were on\nthe march from Fort Ridgeley. A large body of warriors set out to meet\nthem.\n\n“Nephew, you have spilled the first blood of the white man; go, join in\nbattle with the soldiers. They are armed; they can defend themselves,”\n remarked the old chief, and Tawasuota replied:\n\n“Uncle, you speak truth; I have committed the act of a coward. It was\nnot of my own will I did it; nevertheless, I have raised my weapon, and\nI will fight the whites as long as I live. If I am ever taken, they\nwill first have to kill me.” He arose, took up his gun, and joined the\nwar-party.\n\nThe dreadful day of massacre was almost ended. The terrified Sioux women\nand children had fled up the river before the approaching troops. Long\nshafts of light from the setting sun painted every hill; one side red as\nwith blood, the other dark as the shadow of death. A cloud of smoke\nfrom burning homes hung over the beautiful river. Even the permanent\ndwellings of the Indians were empty, and all the teepees which had\ndotted with their white cones the west bank of the Minnesota had\ndisappeared. Here and there were small groups of warriors returning from\ntheir bloody work, and among them was Tawasuota.\n\nHe looked long at the spot where his home had stood; but it was gone,\nand with it his family. Ah, the beautiful country of his ancestors! he\nmust depart from it forever, for he knew now that the white man would\noccupy that land. Sadly he sang the spirit-song, and made his appeal to\nthe “Great Mystery,” excusing himself by the plea that what he had done\nhad been in the path of duty. There was no glory in it for him; he\ncould wear no eagle feather, nor could he ever recount the deed. It\nwas dreadful to him--the thought that he had fired upon an unarmed and\nhelpless man.\n\nThe chief soldier followed the broad trail of the fleeing host, and\nafter some hours he came upon a camp. There were no war-songs nor\ndances there, as was their wont after a battle, but a strange stillness\nreigned. Even the dogs scarcely barked at his approach; everything\nseemed conscious of the awful carnage of the day.\n\nHe stopped at a tent and inquired after his beautiful wife and two\nlittle sons, whom he had already trained to uphold their father’s\nreputation, but was directed to his mother’s teepee.\n\n“Ah, my son, my son, what have you done?” cried his old mother when she\nsaw him. “Come in, come in; let us eat together once more; for I have a\nforeboding that it is for the last time. Alas, what have you done?”\n\nTawasuota silently entered the tent of his widowed mother, and his three\nsisters gave him the place of honor.\n\n“Mother, it is not right to blame our brother,” said the eldest. “He was\nthe chief’s head soldier; and if he had disobeyed his orders, he would\nhave been called a coward. That he could not bear.”\n\nFood was handed him, and he swallowed a few mouthfuls, and gave back the\ndish.\n\n“You have not yet told me where she is, and the children,” he said with\na deep sigh.\n\n“My son, my son, I have not, because it will give you pain. I wanted you\nto eat first! She has been taken away by her own mother to Faribault,\namong the white people. I could not persuade them to wait until you\ncame. Her people are lovers of the whites. They have even accepted their\nreligion,” grieved the good old mother.\n\nTawasuota’s head dropped upon his chest, and he sat silent for a long\ntime. The mother and three sisters were also silent, for they knew how\nheavy his grief must be. At last he spoke.\n\n“Mother, I am too proud to desert the tribe now and join my wife among\nthe white people. My brother-in-law may lie in my behalf, and say that\nmy hands are not stained with blood; but the spirits of those who died\nto-day would rebuke me, and the rebuke would be just. No, I must fight\nthe whites until I die; and neither have I fought without cause; but I\nmust see my sons once more before I go.”\n\nWhen Tawasuota left his mother’s teepee he walked fast across the circle\ntoward the council lodge to see Little Crow. He drew his blanket closely\nabout him, with his gun underneath. The keen eye of the wily chief\ndetected the severe expression upon the face of his guest, and he\nhastened to speak first.\n\n“There are times in the life of every great man when he must face\nhardship and put self aside for the good of his people. You have done\nwell to-day!”\n\n“I care little for myself,” replied Tawasuota, “but my heart is heavy\nto-night. My wife and two boys have been taken away among the whites by\nmy mother-in-law. I fear for their safety, when it is known what we have\ndone.”\n\n“Ugh, that old woman is too hasty in accepting the ways of the stranger\npeople!” exclaimed the chief.\n\n“I am now on my way to see them,” declared Tawasuota.\n\n“Ugh, ugh, I shall need you to-morrow! My plan is to attack the soldiers\nat Fort Ridgeley with a strong force. There are not many. Then we shall\nattack New Ulm and other towns. We will drive them all back into Saint\nPaul and Fort Snelling.” Little Crow spoke with energy.\n\n“You must stay,” he added, “and lead the attack either at the fort or at\nNew Ulm.”\n\nFor some minutes the chief soldier sat in silence.\n\nAt last he said simply, “I will do it.”\n\nOn the following day the attack was made, but it was unsuccessful. The\nwhole State was now alarmed, and all the frontier settlers left\nalive had flocked to the larger and more protected towns. It had also\ndeveloped during the day that there was a large party of Sioux who were\nready to surrender, thereby showing that they had not been party to the\nmassacre nor indorsed the hasty action of the tribe.\n\nAt evening Tawasuota saw that there would be a long war with the whites,\nand that the Indians must remove their families out of danger. The\nfeeling against all Indians was great. Night had brought him no relief\nof mind, but it promised to shield him in a hazardous undertaking. He\nconsulted no one, but set out for the distant village of Faribault.\n\nHe kept to the flats back of the Minnesota, away from the well-traveled\nroads, and moved on at a good gait, for he realized that he had to cover\na hundred miles in as few hours as possible. Every day that passed would\nmake it more difficult for him to rejoin his family.\n\nAlthough he kept as far as he could from the settlements, he would come\nnow and then upon a solitary frame house, razed to the ground by the\nwar-parties of the day before. The members of the ill-fated family were\nto be seen scattered in and about the place; and their white, upturned\nfaces told him that his race must pay for the deed.\n\nThe dog that howled pitifully over the dead was often the only survivor\nof the farmer’s household.\n\nOccasionally Tawasuota heard at a distance the wagons of the fugitives,\nloaded with women and children, while armed men walked before and\nbehind. These caravans were usually drawn by oxen and moved slowly\ntoward some large town.\n\nWhen the dawn appeared in the east, the chief soldier was compelled to\nconceal himself in a secluded place. He rolled up in his blanket, lay\ndown in a dry creek-bed among the red willows and immediately fell\nasleep.\n\nWith the next evening he resumed his journey, and reached Faribault\ntoward midnight. Even here every approach was guarded against the\npossibility of an Indian attack. But there was much forest, and he knew\nthe country well. He reconnoitred, and soon found the Indian community,\nbut dared not approach and enter, for these Indians had allied\nthemselves with the whites; they would be charged with treachery if\nit were known that they had received a hostile Sioux, and none were so\nhated by the white people as Little Crow and his war-chief.\n\nHe chose a concealed position from which he might watch the movements of\nhis wife, if she were indeed there, and had not been waylaid and slain\non the journey hither.\n\nThat night was the hardest one that the warrior had ever known. If he\nslept, it was only to dream of the war-whoop and attack; but at last he\nfound himself broad awake, the sun well up, and yes! there were his two\nlittle sons, playing outside their teepee as of old. The next moment he\nheard the voice of his wife from the deep woods wailing for her husband!\n\n“Oh, take us, husband, take us with you! let us all die together!” she\npleaded as she clung to him whom she had regarded as already dead; for\nshe knew of the price that had been put upon his head, and that some\nof the halfbreeds loved money better than the blood of their Indian\nmothers.\n\nTawasuota stood for a minute without speaking, while his huge frame\ntrembled like a mighty pine beneath the thunderbolt.\n\n“No,” he said at last. “I shall go, but you must remain. You are a\nwoman, and the white people need not know that your little boys are\nmine. Bring them here to me this evening that I may kiss them farewell.”\n\nThe sun was hovering among the treetops when they met again.\n\n“Atay! atay!” (“Papa, papa!”) the little fellows cried out in spite of\nher cautions; but the mother put her finger to her lips, and they became\nsilent. Tawasuota took each boy in his arms, and held him close for a\nfew moments; he smiled to them, but large tears rolled down his cheeks.\nThen he disappeared in the shadows, and they never saw him again.\n\nThe chief soldier lived and died a warrior and an enemy to the white\nman; but one of his two sons became in after-years a minister of the\nChristian gospel, under the “Long-Haired Praying Man,” Bishop Whipple,\nof Minnesota.\n\n\n\n\nVI. THE WHITE MAN’S ERRAND\n\nUpon the wide tableland that lies at the back of a certain Indian\nagency, a camp of a thousand teepees was pitched in a circle, according\nto the ancient usage. In the center of the circle stood the council\nlodge, where there were gathered together of an afternoon all the men\nof years and distinction, some in blankets, some in uniform, and still\nothers clad in beggarly white man’s clothing. But the minds of all were\nalike upon the days of their youth and freedom.\n\nAround the council fire they passed and repassed the pipe of peace, and\nwhen the big drum was struck they sang the accompaniment with sad yet\npleasant thoughts of the life that is past. Between the songs stories of\nbrave deeds and dangerous exploits were related by the actors in turn,\nwith as much spirit and zest as if they were still living in those days.\n\n“Tum, tum, tum,” the drum was sounded.\n\n“Oow, oow!” they hooted in a joyous chorus at the close of each refrain.\n\n“Ho!” exclaimed finally the master of ceremonies for the evening. “It is\nZuyamani’s story of his great ride that we should now hear! It was\nnot far from this place, upon the Missouri River, and within the\nrecollection of many of us that this occurred. Ye young men must hear!”\n\n“Ho, ho!” was the ready response of all present, and the drum was struck\nonce according to custom. The pipe was filled and handed to Zuyamani,\nwho gravely smoked for a few moments in silence. Then he related his\ncontribution to the unwritten history of our frontier in these words:\n\n“It was during the winter following that summer in which General Sibley\npursued many of our people across the Muddy River (1863), that\nwe Hunkpatees, friendly Sioux, were camping at a place called\n‘Hunt-the-Deer,’ about two miles from Fort Rice, Dakota Territory.\n\n“The Chief Soldier of the garrison called one day upon the leading\nchiefs of our band. To each one he said: ‘Lend me your bravest warrior!’\nEach chief called his principal warriors together and laid the matter\nbefore them.\n\n“‘The Chief Soldier at this place,’ they explained, ‘wants to send a\nmessage to Fort Berthold, where the Rees and Mandans live, to another\nChief Soldier there. The soldiers of the Great Father do not know the\nway, neither could any of them get through the lines. He asks for a\nbrave man to carry his message.’\n\n“The Mandans and the Rees were our hereditary enemies, but this was not\nthe principal reason for our hesitation. We had declared allegiance\nto the Great Father at Washington; we had taken our stand against the\nfighting men of our own nation, and the hostile Sioux were worse than\nenemies to us at this time!\n\n“Each chief had only called on his leading warriors, and each in turn\nreported his failure to secure a volunteer.\n\n“Then the Chief Soldier sent again and said: ‘Is there not a young\nman among you who dares to face death? If he reaches the fort with my\nmessage, he will need to be quick-witted as well as brave, and the Great\nFather will not forget him!’\n\n“Now all the chiefs together called all the young men in a great\ncouncil, and submitted to them the demand of the Great Father’s servant.\nWe knew well that the country between us and Fort Berthold, about one\nhundred and fifty miles distant, was alive with hostile Sioux, and that\nif any of us should be caught and recognized by them, he would surely\nbe put to death. It would not be easy to deceive them by professing\nhostility to the Government, for the record of each individual Indian\nis well known. The warriors were still unwilling to go, for they argued\nthus: ‘This is a white man’s errand, and will not be recorded as a\nbrave deed upon the honor roll of our people.’ I think many would have\nvolunteered but for that belief. At that time we had not a high opinion\nof the white man.\n\n“Since all the rest were silent, it came into my mind to offer my\nservices. The warriors looked at me in astonishment, for I was a very\nyoung man and had no experience.\n\n“Our chief, Two Bears, who was my own uncle, finally presented my name\nto the commanding officer. He praised my courage and begged me to\nbe vigilant. The interpreter told him that I had never been upon the\nwar-path and would be knocked over like a rabbit, but as no one else\nwould go, he was obliged to accept me as his messenger. He gave me a\nfine horse and saddle; also a rifle and soldier’s uniform. I would not\ntake the gun nor wear the blue coat. I accepted only a revolver, and I\ntook my bow and quiver full of arrows, and wore my usual dress. I hid\nthe letter in my moccasin.\n\n“I set out before daybreak the next morning. The snow was deep. I rode\nup the river, on the west bank, keeping a very close watch all the way,\nbut seeing nothing. I had been provided with a pair of field glasses,\nand I surveyed the country on all sides from the top of every hill.\nHaving traveled all day and part of the night, I rested my horse and I\ntook a little sleep.\n\n“After eating a small quantity of pemmican, I made a very early start\nin the morning. It was scarcely light when I headed for a near-by ridge\nfrom which to survey the country beyond. Just as I ascended the rise I\nfound myself almost surrounded by loose ponies, evidently belonging to a\nwinter camp of the hostile Sioux.\n\n“I readjusted my saddle, tightened the girths, and prepared to ride\nswiftly around the camp. I saw some men already out after ponies. No one\nappeared to have seen me as yet, but I felt that as soon as it became\nlighter they could not help observing me. I turned to make the circuit\nof the camp, which was a very large one, and as soon as I reached the\ntimbered bottom lands I began to congratulate myself that I had not been\nseen.\n\n“As I entered the woods at the crossing of a dry creek, I noticed that\nmy horse was nervous. I knew that horses are quick to discover animals\nor men by scent, and I became nervous, too.\n\n“The animal put his four feet together and almost slid down the steep\nbank. As he came out on the opposite side he swerved suddenly and\nstarted to run. Then I saw a man watching me from behind a tree.\nFortunately for me, he carried no weapon. He was out after ponies, and\nhad only a lariat wound upon one shoulder.\n\n“He beckoned and made signs for me to stop, but I spurred my horse and\ntook flight at once. I could hear him yelling far behind me, no doubt to\narouse the camp and set them on my trail.\n\n“As I fled westward, I came upon another man, mounted, and driving his\nponies before him. He yelled and hooted in vain; then turned and rode\nafter me. Two others had started in pursuit, but my horse was a good\none, and I easily outdistanced them at the start.\n\n“After I had fairly circled the camp, I turned again toward the river,\nhoping to regain the bottom lands. The traveling was bad. Sometimes we\ncame to deep gulches filled with snow, where my horse would sink in\nup to his body and seem unable to move. When I jumped off his back and\nstruck him once or twice, he would make several desperate leaps and\nrecover his footing. My pursuers were equally hindered, but by this\ntime the pursuit was general, and in order to terrify me they yelled\ncontinually and fired their guns into the air. Now and then I came to\na gulch which I had to follow up in search of a place to cross, and at\nsuch times they gained on me. I began to despair, for I knew that the\nwhite man’s horses have not the endurance of our Indian ponies, and I\nexpected to be chased most of the day.\n\n“Finally I came to a ravine that seemed impossible to cross. As I\nfollowed it up, it became evident that some of them had known of this\ntrap, and had cut in ahead of me. I felt that I must soon abandon my\nhorse and slide down the steep sides of the gulch to save myself.\n\n“However, I made one last effort to pass my enemies. They came within\ngunshot and several fired at me, although all our horses were going at\nfull speed. They missed me, and being at last clear of them, I came to a\nplace where I could cross, and the pursuit stopped.”\n\nWhen Zuyamani reached this point in his recital, the great drum was\nstruck several times, and all the men cheered him.\n\n“The days are short in winter,” he went on after a short pause, “and\njust now the sun sank behind the hills. I did not linger. I continued my\njourney by night, and reached Fort Berthold before midnight. I had been\nso thoroughly frightened and was so much exhausted that I did not\nwant to talk, and as soon as I had delivered my letters to the post\ncommander, I went to the interpreter’s quarters to sleep.\n\n“The interpreter, however, announced my arrival, and that same night\nmany Ree, Gros Ventre, and Mandan warriors came to call upon me. Among\nthem was a great chief of the Rees, called Poor Dog.\n\n“‘You must be,’ said he to me, ‘either a very young man, or a fool! You\nhave not told us about your close escape, but a runner came in at dusk\nand told us of the pursuit. He reported that you had been killed by\nthe hostiles, for he heard many guns fired about the middle of the\nafternoon. These white men will never give you any credit for your\nwonderful ride, nor will they compensate you for the risks you have\ntaken in their service. They will not give you so much as one eagle\nfeather for what you have done!’\n\n“The next day I was sent for to go to headquarters, and there I related\nmy all-day pursuit by the hostile Sioux. The commanding officer advised\nme to remain at the fort fifteen days before making the return trip,\nthinking that by that time my enemies might cease to look for me.\n\n“At the end of the fortnight he wrote his letters, and I told him that\nI was ready to start. ‘I will give you,’ he said, ‘twenty Rees and Gros\nVentres to escort you past the hostile camp.’ We set out very early and\nrode all day, so that night overtook us just before we reached the camp.\n\n“At nightfall we sent two scouts ahead, but before they left us they\ntook the oath of the pipe in token of their loyalty. You all know the\nancient war custom. A lighted pipe was held toward them and each one\nsolemnly touched it, after which it was passed as usual.\n\n“We followed more slowly, and at about midnight we came to the place\nwhere our scouts had agreed to meet us. They were to return from a\nreconnaissance of the camp and report on what they had seen. It was a\nlonely spot, and the night was very cold and still. We sat there in the\nsnowy woods near a little creek and smoked in silence while we waited.\nI had plenty of time to reflect upon my position. These Gros Ventres\nand Rees have been our enemies for generations. I was one man to twenty!\nThey had their orders from the commander of the fort, and that was my\nonly safeguard.\n\n“Soon we heard the howl of a wolf a little to the westward. Immediately\none of the party answered in the same manner. I could not have told\nit from the howl of a real wolf. Then we heard a hooting owl down the\ncreek. Another of our party hooted like an owl.\n\n“Presently the wolf’s voice sounded nearer, while the owl’s hoot came\nnearer in the opposite direction. Then we heard the footsteps of ponies\non the crisp, frosty air. The scout who had been imitating the wolf came\nin first, and the owl soon followed. The warriors made a ring and again\nfilled the pipe, and the scouts took the oath for the second time.\n\n“After smoking, they reported a trail going up a stream tributary to the\nMissouri, but whether going out or coming in it was impossible to tell\nin the dark. It was several days old. This was discussed for some time.\nThe question was whether some had gone out in search of meat, or whether\nsome additional men had come into camp.\n\n“The Bunch of Stars was already a little west of the middle sky when we\nset out again. They agreed to take me a short distance beyond this creek\nand there leave me, as they were afraid to go any further. On the bank\nof the creek we took a farewell smoke. There was a faint glow in the\neast, showing that it was almost morning. The warriors sang a ‘Strong\nHeart’ song for me in an undertone as I went on alone.\n\n“I tried to make a wide circuit of the camp, but I passed their ponies\ngrazing all over the side hills at a considerable distance, and I went\nas quietly as possible, so as not to frighten them. When I had fairly\npassed the camp I came down to the road again, and I let my horse fly!\n\n“I had been cautioned at the post that the crossings of the creeks on\neither side of the camp were the most dangerous places, since they would\nbe likely to watch for me there. I had left the second crossing far\nbehind, and I felt quite safe; but I was tired and chilled by the long\nride. My horse, too, began to show signs of fatigue. In a deep ravine\nwhere there was plenty of dry wood and shelter, I cleared the ground of\nsnow and kindled a small fire. Then I gave the horse his last ration of\noats, and I ate the last of the pemmican that the Ree scouts had given\nme.\n\n“Suddenly he pricked up his ears in the direction of home. He ate a\nmouthful and listened again. I began to grow nervous, and I listened,\ntoo. Soon I heard the footsteps of horses in the snow at a considerable\ndistance.\n\n“Hastily I mounted and took flight along the ravine until I had to come\nout upon the open plain, in full view of a party of about thirty\nSioux in war-paint, coming back from the direction of Fort Rice. They\nimmediately gave chase, yelling and flourishing their guns and tomahawks\nover their heads. I urged my horse to his best speed, for I felt that\nif they should overtake me, nothing could save me! My friend, White Elk,\nhere, was one of that warparty.\n\n“I saw that I had a fair lead and the best horse, and was gaining upon\nthem, when about two miles out I met some more of the party who had\nlingered behind the rest. I was surrounded!\n\n“I turned toward the north, to a deep gulch that I knew I should find\nthere, and I led my horse along a narrow and slippery ridge to a deep\nhole. Here I took up my position. I guarded the pass with my bow and\narrows, and they could not reach me unless they should follow the ridge\nin single file. I knew that they would not storm my position, for that\nis not the Indian way of fighting, but I supposed that they would try\nto tire me out. They yelled and hooted, and shot many bullets and arrows\nover my head to terrify me into surrender, but I remained motionless and\nsilent.\n\n“Night came, with a full round moon. All was light as day except the\nplace where I stood, half frozen and not daring to move. The bottom of\nthe gulch was as black as a well and almost as cold. The wolves howled\nall around me in the stillness. At last I heard the footsteps of horses\nretreating, and then no other sound. Still I dared not come out. I must\nhave slept, for it was dawn when I seemed to hear faintly the yelling of\nwarriors, and then I heard my own name.\n\n“‘Zuyamani, tokiya nunka huwo?’ (Where are you, Zuyamani?) they shouted.\nA party of my friends had come out to meet me and had followed our\ntrail. I was scarcely able to walk when I came out, but they filled the\npipe and held it up to me, as is done in recognition of distinguished\nservice. They escorted me into the post, singing war songs and songs of\nbrave deeds, and there I delivered up his letters to the Chief Soldier.”\n\nAgain the drum was struck and the old men cheered Zuyamani, who added:\n\n“I think that Poor Dog was right, for the Great Father never gave me any\ncredit, nor did he ever reward me for what I had done. Yet I have not\nbeen without honor, for my own people have not forgotten me, even though\nI went upon the white man’s errand.”\n\n\n\n\nVII. THE GRAVE OF THE DOG\n\nThe full moon was just clear of the high mountain ranges. Surrounded by\na ring of bluish haze, it looked almost as if it were frozen against the\nimpalpable blueblack of the reckless midwinter sky.\n\nThe game scout moved slowly homeward, well wrapped in his long buffalo\nrobe, which was securely belted to his strong loins; his quiver tightly\ntied to his shoulders so as not to impede his progress. It was enough to\ncarry upon his feet two strong snow-shoes; for the snow was deep and its\ncrust too thin to bear his weight.\n\nAs he emerged from the lowlands into the upper regions, he loomed up\na gigantic figure against the clear, moonlit horizon. His picturesque\nfoxskin cap with all its trimmings was incrusted with frost from the\nbreath of his nostrils, and his lagging footfall sounded crisply. The\ndistance he had that day covered was enough for any human endurance; yet\nhe was neither faint nor hungry; but his feet were frozen into the psay,\nthe snow-shoes, so that he could not run faster than an easy slip and\nslide.\n\nAt last he reached the much-coveted point--the crown of the last ascent;\nand when he smelled fire and the savory odor of the jerked buffalo meat,\nit well-nigh caused him to waver! But he must not fail to follow the\ncustom of untold ages, and give the game scout’s wolf call before\nentering camp.\n\nAccordingly he paused upon the highest point of the ridge and uttered\na cry to which the hungry cry of a real wolf would have seemed but a\ncoyote’s yelp in comparison! Then it was that the rest of the buffalo\nhunters knew that their game scout was returning with welcome news; for\nthe unsuccessful scout enters the camp silently.\n\nA second time he gave the call to assure his hearers that their ears\ndid not deceive them. The gray wolves received the news with perfect\nunderstanding. It meant food! “Woo-o-o-o! woo-o-o-o!” came from all\ndirections, especially from the opposite ridge. Thus the ghostly, cold,\nweird night was enlivened with the music from many wild throats.\n\nDown the gradual slope the scout hastened; his footfall was the only\nsound that broke the stillness after the answers to his call had ceased.\nAs he crossed a little ridge an immense wolf suddenly confronted him,\nand instead of retreating, calmly sat up and gazed steadfastly into his\nface.\n\n“Welcome, welcome, friend!” the hunter spoke as he passed.\n\nIn the meantime, the hunters at the temporary camp were aroused to a\nhigh pitch of excitement. Some turned their buffalo robes and put them\non in such a way as to convert themselves into make-believe bison, and\nbegan to tread the snow, while others were singing the buffalo song,\nthat their spirits might be charmed and allured within the circle of\nthe camp-fires. The scout, too, was singing his buffalo bull song in a\nguttural, lowing chant as he neared the hunting camp. Within arrow-shot\nhe paused again, while the usual ceremonies were enacted for his\nreception. This done, he was seated with the leaders in a chosen place.\n\n“It was a long run,” he said, “but there were no difficulties. I found\nthe first herd directly north of here. The second herd, a great one,\nis northeast, near Shell Lake. The snow is deep. The buffalo can only\nfollow their leader in their retreat.”\n\n“Hi, hi, hi!” the hunters exclaimed solemnly in token of gratitude,\nraising their hands heavenward and then pointing them toward the ground.\n\n“Ho, kola! one more round of the buffalo-pipe, then we shall retire, to\nrise before daybreak for the hunt,” advised one of the leaders. Silently\nthey partook in turn of the long-stemmed pipe, and one by one, with a\ndignified “Ho!” departed to their teepees.\n\nThe scout betook himself to his little old buffalo teepee, which he used\nfor winter hunting expeditions. His faithful Shunka, who had been all\nthis time its only occupant, met him at the entrance as dogs alone know\nhow to welcome a lifelong friend. As his master entered he stretched\nhimself in his old-time way, from the tip of his tail to that of his\ntongue, and finished by curling both ends upward.\n\n“Ho, mita shunka, eat this; for you must be hungry!” So saying, the\nscout laid before his canine friend the last piece of his dried buffalo\nmeat. It was the sweetest meal ever eaten by a dog, judging by his long\nsmacking of his lips after he had swallowed it!\n\nThe hunting party was soon lost in heavy slumber. Not a sound could be\nheard save the gnawing of the ponies upon the cottonwood bark, which was\nprovided for them instead of hay in the winter time.\n\nAll about Shell Lake the bison were gathered in great herds. The\nunmistakable signs of the sky had warned them of approaching bad\nweather. The moon’s robe was girdled with the rainbow wampum of heaven.\nThe very music of the snow under their feet had given them warning. On\nthe north side of Shell Lake there were several deep gulches, which were\nthe homes of every wanderer of the plains at such a time at this. When\nthere was a change toward severe weather, all the four-footed people\nheaded for this lake. Here was a heavy growth of reeds, rushes, and\ncoarse grass, making good shelters, and also springs, which afforded\nwater after the lake was frozen solid. Hence great numbers of the bison\nhad gathered here.\n\nWhen Wapashaw, the game scout, had rolled himself in his warm buffalo\nrobe and was sound asleep, his faithful companion hunter, the great\nEsquimaux wolf dog, silently rose and again stretched himself, then\nstood quiet for a moment as if meditating. It was clear that he knew\nwell what he had planned to do, but was considering how he should do it\nwithout arousing any suspicion of his movements. This is a dog’s art,\nand the night tricks and marauding must always be the joy and secret of\nhis life!\n\nSoftly he emerged from the lodge and gave a sweeping glance around to\nassure him that there were none to spy upon him. Suspiciously he sniffed\nthe air, as if to ascertain whether there could be any danger to his\nsleeping master while he should be away.\n\nHis purpose was still a secret. It may be that it was not entirely a\nselfish one, or merely the satisfying of his inherited traits. Having\nfully convinced himself of the safety of the unguarded camp, he went\nforth into the biting cold. The moon was now well up on the prairies of\nthe sky. There were no cloud hills in the blue field above to conceal\nher from view. Her brilliant light set on fire every snow gem upon the\nplains and hillsides about the hunters’ camp.\n\nUp the long ascent he trotted in a northerly direction, yet not\nfollowing his master’s trail. He was large and formidable in strength,\ncombining the features of his wild brothers of the plains with those of\nthe dogs who keep company with the red men. His jet-black hair and sharp\nears and nose appeared to immense advantage against the spotless and\njeweled snow, until presently his own warm breath had coated him with\nheavy frost.\n\nAfter a time Shunka struck into his master’s trail and followed it all\nthe way, only taking a short cut here and there when by dog instinct he\nknew that a man must go around such a point to get to his destination.\nHe met many travelers during the night, but none had dared to approach\nhim, though some few followed at a distance, as if to discover his\npurpose.\n\nAt last he reached Shell Lake, and there beheld a great gathering of the\nherds! They stood in groups, like enormous rocks, no longer black,\nbut white with frost. Every one of them emitted a white steam, quickly\nfrozen into a fine snow in the air.\n\nShunka sat upon his haunches and gazed.\n\n“Wough, this is it!” he said to himself. He had kept still when the game\nscout gave the wolf call, though the camp was in an uproar, and from\nthe adjacent hills the wild hunters were equally joyous, because they\nunderstood the meaning of the unwonted noise. Yet his curiosity was not\nfully satisfied, and he had set out to discover the truth, and it may be\nto protect or serve his master in case of danger.\n\nAt daybreak the great dog meekly entered his master’s rude teepee, and\nfound him already preparing for the prospective hunt. He was filling his\ninside moccasins full of buffalo hair to serve as stockings, over which\nhe put on his large buffalo moccasins with the hair inside, and adjusted\nhis warm leggings. He then adjusted his snowshoes and filled his quiver\nfull of good arrows. The dog quietly lay down in a warm place, making\nhimself as small as possible, as if to escape observation, and calmly\nwatched his master.\n\n“Ho, ho, ho, kola! Enakanee, enakanee!” shouted the game herald. “It is\nalways best to get the game early; then their spirits can take flight\nwith the coming of a new day!”\n\nAll had now donned their snow-shoes. There was no food left; therefore\nno delay to prepare breakfast.\n\n“It is very propitious for our hunt,” one exclaimed; “everything is in\nour favor. There is a good crust on the snow, and the promise of a good\nclear day!”\n\nSoon all the hunters were running in single file upon the trail of the\nscout, each Indian closely followed by his trusty hunting dog. In less\nthan two hours they stood just back of the low ridge which rounded the\nsouth side of Shell Lake. The narrow strip of land between its twin\ndivisions was literally filled with the bison. In the gulches beyond,\nbetween the dark lines of timber, there were also scattered groups;\nbut the hunters at once saw their advantage over the herd upon the\npeninsula.\n\n“Hechetu, kola! This is well, friends!” exclaimed the first to speak.\n“These can be forced to cross the slippery ice and the mire around the\nsprings. This will help us to get more meat. Our people are hungry, and\nwe must kill many in order to feed them!”\n\n“Ho, ho, ho!” agreed all the hunters.\n\n“And it is here that we can use our companion hunters best, for the\nshunkas will intimidate and bewilder the buffalo women,” said an old\nman.\n\n“Ugh, he is always right! Our dogs must help us here. The meat will be\ntheirs as well as ours,” another added.\n\n“Tosh, kola! The game scout’s dog is the greatest shunka of them all!\nHe has a mind near like that of a man. Let him lead the attack of his\nfellows, while we crawl up on the opposite side and surround the buffalo\nupon the slippery ice and in the deceitful mire,” spoke up a third. So\nit was agreed that the game scout and his Shunka should lead the attack\nof the dogs.\n\n“Woo, woo, woo!” was the hoarse signal from the throat of the game\nscout; but his voice was drowned by the howling and barking of the\nsavage dogs as they made their charge. In a moment all was confusion\namong the buffalo. Some started this way, others that, and the great\nmass swayed to and fro uncertainly. A few were ready to fight, but the\nsnow was too deep for a countercharge upon the dogs, save on the ice\njust in front of them, where the wind had always full sweep. There all\nwas slippery and shining! In their excitement and confusion the bison\nrushed upon this uncertain plain.\n\nTheir weight and the momentum of their rush carried them hopelessly far\nout, where they were again confused as to which way to go, and many were\nstuck in the mire which was concealed by the snow, except here and there\nan opening above a spring from which there issued a steaming vapor.\nThe game scout and his valiant dog led on the force of canines with\ndeafening war-cries, and one could see black heads here and there\npopping from behind the embankments. As the herd finally swept toward\nthe opposite shore, many dead were left behind. Pierced by the arrows of\nthe hunters, they lay like black mounds upon the glassy plain.\n\nIt was a great hunt! “Once more the camp will be fed,” they thought, “and\nthis good fortune will help us to reach the spring alive!”\n\nA chant of rejoicing rang out from the opposite shore, while the game\nscout unsheathed his big knife and began the work which is ever the\nsequel of the hunt--to dress the game; although the survivors of the\nslaughter had scarcely disappeared behind the hills. The dogs had all\nrun back to their respective masters, and this left the scout and\nhis companion Shunka alone. Some were appointed to start a camp in a\nneighboring gulch among the trees, so that the hunters might bring their\nmeat there and eat before setting out for the great camp on the Big\nRiver.\n\nAll were busily skinning and cutting up the meat into pieces convenient\nfor carrying, when suddenly a hunter called the attention of those near\nhim to an ominous change in the atmosphere.\n\n“There are signs of a blizzard! We must hurry into the near woods before\nit reaches us!” he shouted.\n\nSome heard him; others did not. Those who saw or heard passed on the\nsignal and hurried toward the wood, where others had already arranged\nrude shelters and gathered piles of dry wood for fuel.\n\nAround the several camp-fires the hunters sat or stood, while slices\nof savory meat were broiled and eaten with a relish by the half-starved\nmen.\n\n“Ho, kola! Eat this, friend!” said they to one another as one finished\nbroiling a steak of the bison and offered it to his neighbor.\n\nBut the storm had now fairly enveloped them in whirling whiteness.\n“Woo, woo!” they called to those who had not yet reached camp. One after\nanother answered and emerged from the blinding pall of snow. At last\nnone were missing save the game scout and his Shunka!\n\nThe hunters passed the time in eating and telling stories until a late\nhour, occasionally giving a united shout to guide the lost one should he\nchance to pass near their camp.\n\n“Fear not for our scout, friends!” finally exclaimed a leader\namong them. “He is a brave and experienced man. He will find a safe\nresting-place, and join us when the wind ceases to rage.” So they all\nwrapped themselves in their robes and lay down to sleep.\n\nAll that night and the following day it was impossible to give succor,\nand the hunters felt much concern for the absent. Late in the second\nnight the great storm subsided.\n\n“Ho, ho! Iyotanka! Rise up!” So the first hunter to awaken aroused all\nthe others.\n\nAs after every other storm, it was wonderfully still; so still that one\ncould hear distinctly the pounding feet of the jack-rabbits coming down\nover the slopes to the willows for food. All dry vegetation was buried\nbeneath the deep snow, and everywhere they saw this white-robed creature\nof the prairie coming down to the woods.\n\nNow the air was full of the wolf and coyote game call, and they were\nseen in great numbers upon the ice.\n\n“See, see! the hungry wolves are dragging the carcasses away! Harken\nto the war cries of the scout’s Shunka! Hurry, hurry!” they urged one\nanother in chorus.\n\nAway they ran and out upon the lake; now upon the wind-swept ice, now\nupon the crusted snow; running when they could, sliding when they must.\nThere was certainly a great concourse of the wolves, whirling in frantic\ncircles, but continually moving toward the farther end of the lake.\nThey could hear distinctly the hoarse bark of the scout’s Shunka, and\noccasionally the muffled war-whoop of a man, as if it came from under\nthe ice!\n\nAs they approached nearer the scene they could hear more distinctly the\nvoice of their friend, but still as it were from underground. When they\nreached the spot to which the wolves had dragged two of the carcasses of\nthe buffalo, Shunka was seen to stand by one of them, but at that moment\nhe staggered and fell. The hunters took out their knives and ripped up\nthe frozen hide covering the abdominal cavity. It revealed a warm nest\nof hay and buffalo hair in which the scout lay, wrapped in his own robe!\n\nHe had placed his dog in one of the carcasses and himself in another for\nprotection from the storm; but the dog was wiser than the man, for\nhe kept his entrance open. The man lapped the hide over and it froze\nsolidly, shutting him securely in. When the hungry wolves came Shunka\npromptly extricated himself and held them off as long as he could;\nmeanwhile, sliding and pulling, the wolves continued to drag over the\nslippery ice the body of the buffalo in which his master had taken\nrefuge. The poor, faithful dog, with no care for his own safety, stood\nby his imprisoned master until the hunters came up. But it was too late,\nfor he had received more than one mortal wound.\n\nAs soon as the scout got out, with a face more anxious for another than\nfor himself, he exclaimed:\n\n“Where is Shunka, the bravest of his tribe?”\n\n“Ho, kola, it is so, indeed; and here he lies,” replied one sadly.\n\nHis master knelt by his side, gently stroking the face of the dog.\n\n“Ah, my friend; you go where all spirits live! The Great Mystery has a\nhome for every living creature. May he permit our meeting there!”\n\nAt daybreak the scout carried him up to one of the pretty round hills\noverlooking the lake, and built up around him walls of loose stone. Red\npaints were scattered over the snow, in accordance with Indian custom,\nand the farewell song was sung.\n\nSince that day the place has been known to the Sioux as\nShunkahanakapi--the Grave of the Dog.\n\n\n\n\nPART TWO. THE WOMAN\n\n\n\n\nI. WINONA, THE WOMAN-CHILD\n\n\n   Hush, hushaby, little woman!\n   Be brave and weep not!\n   The spirits sleep not;\n   ‘Tis they who ordain\n   To woman, pain.\n\n   Hush, hushaby, little woman!\n   Now, all things bearing,\n   A new gift sharing\n   From those above--\n\n   To woman, love.\n        --Sioux Lullaby.\n\n\n“Chinto, weyanna! Yes, indeed; she is a real little woman,” declares the\nold grandmother, as she receives and critically examines the tiny bit of\nhumanity.\n\nThere is no remark as to the color of its hair or eyes, both so black as\nalmost to be blue, but the old woman scans sharply the delicate profile\nof the baby face.\n\n“Ah, she has the nose of her ancestors! Lips thin as a leaf, and eyes\nbright as stars in midwinter!” she exclaims, as she passes on the furry\nbundle to the other grandmother for her inspection.\n\n“Tokee! she is pretty enough to win a twinkle rom the evening star,”\n remarks that smiling personage.\n\n“And what shall her name be?\n\n“Winona, the First-born, of course. That is hers by right of birth.”\n\n“Still, it may not fit her. One must prove herself worthy in order to\nretain that honorable name.”\n\n“Ugh,” retorts the first grandmother, “she can at least bear it on\nprobation!”\n\n“Tosh, tosh,” the other assents.\n\nThus the unconscious little Winona has passed the first stage of the\nIndian’s christening.\n\nPresently she is folded into a soft white doeskin, well lined with the\nloose down of cattails, and snugly laced into an upright oaken cradle,\nthe front of which is a richly embroidered buckskin bag, with porcupine\nquills and deers’ hoofs suspended from its profuse fringes. This\ngay cradle is strapped upon the second grandmother’s back, and that\ndignitary walks off with the newcomer.\n\n“You must come with me,” she says. “We shall go among the father and\nmother trees, and hear them speak with their thousand tongues, that\nyou may know their language forever. I will hang the cradle of the\nwoman-child upon Utuhu, the oak; and she shall hear the love-sighs of\nthe pine maiden!”\n\nIn this fashion Winona is introduced to nature and becomes at once\n“nature-born,” in accord with the beliefs and practices of the wild red\nman.\n\n“Here she is! Take her,” says the old woman on her return from the\nwoods. She presents the child to its mother, who is sitting in the shade\nof an elm-tree as quietly as if she had not just passed through woman’s\nseverest ordeal in giving a daughter to the brave Chetonska!\n\n“She has a winsome face, as meek and innocent as the face of an ermine,”\n graciously adds the grandmother.\n\nThe mother does not speak. Silently and almost reverently she takes her\nnew and first-born daughter into her arms. She gazes into its velvety\nlittle face of a dusky red tint, and unconsciously presses the closely\nswaddled form to her breast. She feels the mother-instinct seize upon\nher strongly for the first time. Here is a new life, a new hope, a\npossible link between herself and a new race!\n\nAh, a smile plays upon her lips, as she realizes that she has kissed her\nchild! In its eyes and mouth she discerns clearly the features she has\nloved in the strong countenance of another, though in the little woman’s\nface they are softened and retouched by the hand of the “Great Mystery.”\n\nThe baby girl is called Winona for some months, when the medicine-man\nis summoned and requested to name publicly the first-born daughter of\nChetonska, the White Hawk; but not until he has received a present of\na good pony with a finely painted buffalo-robe. It is usual to confer\nanother name besides that of the “First-born,” which may be resumed\nlater if the maiden proves worthy. The name Winona implies much of\nhonor. It means charitable, kind, helpful; all that an eldest sister\nshould be!\n\nThe herald goes around the ring of lodges announcing in singsong fashion\nthe christening, and inviting everybody to a feast in honor of the\nevent. A real American christening is always a gala occasion, when much\nsavage wealth is distributed among the poor and old people. Winona has\nonly just walked, and this fact is also announced with additional gifts.\nA wellborn child is ever before the tribal eye and in the tribal ear, as\nevery little step in its progress toward manhood or womanhood--the first\ntime of walking or swimming, first shot with bow and arrow (if a boy),\nfirst pair of moccasins made (if a girl)--is announced publicly with\nfeasting and the giving of presents.\n\nSo Winona receives her individual name of Tatiyopa, or Her Door. It\nis symbolic, like most Indian names, and implies that the door of the\nbearer is hospitable and her home attractive.\n\nThe two grandmothers, who have carried the little maiden upon their\nbacks, now tell and sing to her by turns all the legends of their most\nnoted female ancestors, from the twin sisters of the old story, the\nmaidens who married among the star people of the sky, down to their own\nmothers. All her lullabies are feminine, and designed to impress upon\nher tender mind the life and duties of her sex.\n\nAs soon as she is old enough to play with dolls she plays mother in all\nseriousness and gravity. She is dressed like a miniature woman (and her\ndolls are clad likewise), in garments of doeskin to her ankles, adorned\nwith long fringes, embroidered with porcupine quills, and dyed with root\ndyes in various colors. Her little blanket or robe, with which she shyly\ndrapes or screens her head and shoulders, is the skin of a buffalo calf\nor a deer, soft, white, embroidered on the smooth side, and often with\nthe head and hoofs left on.\n\n“You must never forget, my little daughter, that you are a woman like\nmyself. Do always those things that you see me do,” her mother often\nadmonishes her.\n\nEven the language of the Sioux has its feminine dialect, and the tiny\ngirl would be greatly abashed were it ever needful to correct her for\nusing a masculine termination.\n\nThis mother makes for her little daughter a miniature copy of every\nrude tool that she uses in her daily tasks. There is a little scraper of\nelk-horn to scrape rawhides preparatory to tanning them, another scraper\nof a different shape for tanning, bone knives, and stone mallets for\npounding choke-cherries and jerked meat.\n\nWhile her mother is bending over a large buffalo-hide stretched and\npinned upon the ground, standing upon it and scraping off the fleshy\nportion as nimbly as a carpenter shaves a board with his plane, Winona,\nat five years of age, stands upon a corner of the great hide and\nindustriously scrapes away with her tiny instrument! When the mother\nstops to sharpen her tool, the little woman always sharpens hers\nalso. Perhaps there is water to be fetched in bags made from the dried\npericardium of an animal; the girl brings some in a smaller water-bag.\nWhen her mother goes for wood she carries one or two sticks on her back.\nShe pitches her play teepee to form an exact copy of her mother’s. Her\nlittle belongings are nearly all practical, and her very play is real!\n\nThus, before she is ten years old, Winona begins to see life honestly\nand in earnest; to consider herself a factor in the life of her\npeople--a link in the genealogy of her race. Yet her effort is not\nforced, her work not done from necessity; it is normal and a development\nof the play-instinct of the young creature. This sort of training leads\nvery early to a genuine desire to serve and to do for others. The little\nWinona loves to give and to please; to be generous and gracious. There\nis no thought of trafficking or economizing in labor and in love.\n\n“Mother, I want to be like the beavers, the ants, and the spiders,\nbecause my grandmother says those are the people most worthy of\nimitation for their industry. She also tells me that I should watch the\nbee, the one that has so many daughters, and allows no young men to come\naround her daughters while they are at work making sweets,” exclaims the\nlittle maiden.\n\n“Truly their industry helps us much, for we often take from their\nhoard,” remarks the mother.\n\n“That is not right, is it mother, if they do not wish to share with us?”\n asks Winona. “But I think the bee is stingy if she has so much and will\nnot share with any one else! When I grow up, I shall help the poor! I\nshall have a big teepee and invite old people often, for when people get\nold they seem to be always hungry, and I think we ought to feed them.”\n\n“My little daughter will please me and her father if she proves to be\nindustrious and skillful with her needle and in all woman’s work. Then\nshe can have a fine teepee and make it all cheerful within. The indolent\nwoman has a small teepee, and it is very smoky. All her children will\nhave sore eyes, and her husband will soon become ill-tempered,” declares\nthe mother, in all seriousness.\n\n“And, daughter, there is something more than this needed to make a\ncheerful home. You must have a good heart, be patient, and speak but\nlittle. Every creature that talks too much is sure to make trouble,” she\nconcludes, wisely.\n\nOne day this careful mother has completed a beautiful little teepee of\nthe skin of a buffalo calf, worked with red porcupine quills in a row of\nrings just below the smoke-flaps and on each side of the front opening.\nIn the center of each ring is a tassel of red and white horse-hair.\nThe tip of each smoke-flap is decorated with the same material, and the\ndoorflap also.\n\nWithin there are neatly arranged raw-hide boxes for housekeeping, and\nsquare bags of soft buckskin adorned with blue and white beads. On\neither side of the fireplace are spread the tanned skins of a buffalo\ncalf and a deer; but there is no bear, wolf, or wildcat skin, for\non these the foot of a woman must never tread! They are for men, and\nsymbolical of manly virtues. There are dolls of all sizes, and a play\ntravois leans against the white wall of the miniature lodge. Even the\npet pup is called in to complete the fanciful home of the little woman.\n\n“Now, my daughter,” says the mother, “you must keep your lodge in\norder!”\n\nHere the little woman is allowed to invite other little women, her\nplaymates. This is where the grandmothers hold sway, chaperoning their\nyoung charges, who must never be long out of their sight. The little\nvisitors bring their work-bags of various skins, artistically made and\ntrimmed. These contain moccasins and other garments for their dolls, on\nwhich they love to occupy themselves.\n\nThe brightly-painted rawhide boxes are reserved for food, and in these\nthe girls bring various prepared meats and other delicacies. This is\nperhaps the most agreeable part of the play to the chaperon, who is\ntreated as an honored guest at the feast!\n\nWinona seldom plays with boys, even her own brothers and cousins, and\nafter she reaches twelve or fourteen years of age she scarcely speaks to\nthem. Modesty is a virtue which is deeply impressed upon her from early\nchildhood, and the bashfully drooping head, the averted look, the voice\nlow and seldom heard, these are graces much esteemed in a maiden.\n\nShe is taught to pay great attention to the care of her long, glossy\nlocks, combing, plaiting, and perfuming them with sweet-scented leaves\nsteeped in oil. Her personal appearance is well understood to be a\nmatter of real moment, and rich dress and ornaments are highly prized.\nFortunately they never go out of fashion, and once owned are permanent\npossessions, unless parted with as ceremonial gifts on some great\noccasion of mourning or festivity.\n\nWhen she reaches a marriageable age her father allows her to give a\nfeast to all the other girls of her immediate clan, and this “Feast of\nVirgins” may only be attended by those of spotless reputation. To have\ngiven or attended a number of them is regarded as a choice honor.\n\nTatiyopa, by the time she is fifteen, has already a name for skill\nin needlework, and generosity in distributing the articles of her own\nmaking. She is now generally called Winona--the charitable and kind! She\nbelieves that it is woman’s work to make and keep a home that will be\nworthy of the bravest, and hospitable to all, and in this simple faith\nshe enters upon the realities of her womanhood.\n\n\n\n\nII. WINONA, THE CHILD-WOMAN\n\n\n   Braver than the bravest,\n    You sought honors at death’s door;\n   Could you not remember\n    One who weeps at home--\n   Could you not remember me?\n\n   Braver than the bravest,\n    You sought honors more than love;\n   Dear, I weep, yet I am not a coward;\n    My heart weeps for thee--\n   My heart weeps when I remember thee!\n               --Sioux Love Song.\n\n\nThe sky is blue overhead, peeping through window-like openings in a roof\nof green leaves. Right between a great pine and a birch tree their soft\ndoeskin shawls are spread, and there sit two Sioux maidens amid their\nfineries--variously colored porcupine quills for embroidery laid upon\nsheets of thin birch-bark, and moccasin tops worked in colors like\nautumn leaves. It is Winona and her friend Miniyata.\n\nThey have arrived at the period during which the young girl is carefully\nsecluded from her brothers and cousins and future lovers, and retires,\nas it were, into the nunnery of the woods, behind a veil of thick\nfoliage. Thus she is expected to develop fully her womanly qualities.\nIn meditation and solitude, entirely alone or with a chosen companion of\nher own sex and age, she gains a secret strength, as she studies the art\nof womanhood from nature herself.\n\nWinona has the robust beauty of the wild lily of the prairie, pure and\nstrong in her deep colors of yellow and scarlet against the savage\nplain and horizon, basking in the open sun like a child, yet soft and\nwoman-like, with drooping head when observed. Both girls are beautifully\nrobed in loose gowns of soft doeskin, girded about the waist with the\nusual very wide leather belt.\n\n“Come, let us practice our sacred dance,” says one to the other. Each\ncrowns her glossy head with a wreath of wild flowers, and they dance\nwith slow steps around the white birch, singing meanwhile the sacred\nsongs.\n\nNow upon the lake that stretches blue to the eastward there appears a\ndistant canoe, a mere speck, no bigger than a bird far off against the\nshining sky.\n\n“See the lifting of the paddles!” exclaims Winona.\n\n“Like the leaping of a trout upon the water!” suggests Miniyata.\n\n“I hope they will not discover us, yet I would like to know who they\nare,” remarks the other, innocently.\n\nThe birch canoe approaches swiftly, with two young men plying the light\ncedar paddles.\n\nThe girls now settle down to their needlework, quite as if they had\nnever laughed or danced or woven garlands, bending over their embroidery\nin perfect silence. Surely they would not wish to attract attention, for\nthe two sturdy young warriors have already landed.\n\nThey pick up the canoe and lay it well up on the bank, out of sight.\nThen one procures a strong pole. They lift a buck deer from the\ncanoe--not a mark upon it, save for the bullet wound; the deer looks as\nif it were sleeping! They tie the hind legs together and the fore legs\nalso and carry it between them on the pole.\n\nQuickly and cleverly they do all this; and now they start forward and\ncome unexpectedly upon the maidens’ retreat! They pause for an instant\nin mute apology, but the girls smile their forgiveness, and the youths\nhurry on toward the village.\n\nWinona has now attended her first maidens’ feast and is considered\neligible to marriage. She may receive young men, but not in public or in\na social way, for such was not the custom of the Sioux. When he speaks,\nshe need not answer him unless she chooses.\n\nThe Indian woman in her quiet way preserves the dignity of the home.\nFrom our standpoint the white man is a law-breaker! The “Great Mystery,”\n we say, does not adorn the woman above the man. His law is spreading\nhorns, or flowing mane, or gorgeous plumage for the male; the female\nhe made plain, but comely, modest and gentle. She is the foundation of\nman’s dignity and honor. Upon her rests the life of the home and of the\nfamily. I have often thought that there is much in this philosophy of an\nuntutored people. Had her husband remained long enough in one place, the\nIndian woman, I believe, would have developed no mean civilization and\nculture of her own.\n\nIt was no disgrace to the chief’s daughter in the old days to work with\nher hands. Indeed, their standard of worth was the willingness to work,\nbut not for the sake of accumulation, only in order to give. Winona has\nlearned to prepare skins, to remove the hair and tan the skin of a deer\nso that it may be made into moccasins within three days. She has a bone\ntool for each stage of the conversion of the stiff raw-hide into velvety\nleather. She has been taught the art of painting tents and raw-hide\ncases, and the manufacture of garments of all kinds.\n\nGenerosity is a trait that is highly developed in the Sioux woman.\nShe makes many moccasins and other articles of clothing for her male\nrelatives, or for any who are not well provided. She loves to see\nher brother the best dressed among the young men, and the moccasins\nespecially of a young brave are the pride of his woman-kind.\n\nHer own person is neatly attired, but ordinarily with great simplicity.\nHer doeskin gown has wide, flowing sleeves; the neck is low, but not so\nlow as is the evening dress of society.\n\nHer moccasins are plain; her leggins close-fitting and not as high as her\nbrother’s. She parts her smooth, jet-black hair in the middle and plaits\nit in two. In the old days she used to do it in one plait wound around\nwith wampum. Her ornaments, sparingly worn, are beads, elks’ teeth, and\na touch of red paint. No feathers are worn by the woman, unless in a\nsacred dance.\n\nShe is supposed to be always occupied with some feminine pursuit or\nengaged in some social affair, which also is strictly feminine as a\nrule. Even her language is peculiar to her sex, some words being used by\nwomen only, while others have a feminine termination.\n\nThere is an etiquette of sitting and standing, which is strictly\nobserved. The woman must never raise her knees or cross her feet when\nseated. She seats herself on the ground sidewise, with both feet under\nher.\n\nNotwithstanding her modesty and undemonstrative ways, there is no lack\nof mirth and relaxation for Winona among her girl companions.\n\nIn summer, swimming and playing in the water is a favorite amusement.\nShe even imitates with the soles of her feet the peculiar, resonant\nsound that the beaver makes with her large, flat tail upon the surface\nof the water. She is a graceful swimmer, keeping the feet together and\nwaving them backward and forward like the tail of a fish.\n\nNearly all her games are different from those of the men. She has a\nsport of wand-throwing which develops fine muscles of the shoulder and\nback. The wands are about eight feet long, and taper gradually from\nan inch and a half to half an inch in diameter. Some of them are\nartistically made, with heads of bone and horn, so that it is remarkable\nto what a distance they may be made to slide over the ground. In the\nfeminine game of ball, which is something like “shinny,” the ball is\ndriven with curved sticks between two goals. It is played with from\ntwo or three to a hundred on a side, and a game between two bands or\nvillages is a picturesque event.\n\nA common indoor diversion is the “deer’s foot” game, played with six\ndeer hoofs on a string, ending in a bone or steel awl. The object is to\nthrow it in such a way as to catch one or more hoofs on the point of the\nawl, a feat which requires no little dexterity. Another is played with\nmarked plum-stones in a bowl, which are thrown like dice and count\naccording to the side that is turned uppermost.\n\nWinona’s wooing is a typical one. As with any other people, love-making\nis more or less in vogue at all times of the year, but more especially\nat midsummer, during the characteristic reunions and festivities of\nthat season. The young men go about usually in pairs, and the maidens do\nlikewise. They may meet by chance at any time of day, in the woods or\nat the spring, but oftenest seek to do so after dark, just outside the\nteepee. The girl has her companion, and he has his, for the sake of\npropriety or protection. The conversation is carried on in a whisper, so\nthat even these chaperons do not hear.\n\nAt the sound of the drum on summer evenings, dances are begun within the\ncircular rows of teepees, but without the circle the young men promenade\nin pairs. Each provides himself with the plaintive flute and plays the\nsimple cadences of his people, while his person is completely covered\nwith his fine robe, so that he cannot be recognized by the passerby. At\nevery pause in the melody he gives his yodel-like love-call, to which\nthe girls respond with their musical, sing-song laughter.\n\nMatosapa has loved Winona since the time he saw her at the lakeside in\nher parlor among the pines. But he has not had much opportunity to speak\nuntil on such a night, after the dances are over. There is no outside\nfire; but a dim light from within the skin teepees sheds a mellow glow\nover the camp, mingling with the light of a young moon. Thus these\nlovers go about like ghosts. Matosapa has already circled the teepees\nwith his inseparable brother-friend, Brave Elk.\n\n“Friend, do me an honor to-night!” he exclaims, at last. “Open this\nfirst door for me, since this will be the first time I shall speak to a\nwoman!”\n\n“Ah,” suggests Brave Elk, “I hope you have selected a girl whose\ngrandmother has no cross dogs!”\n\n“The prize that is won at great risk is usually valued most,” replies\nMatosapa.\n\n“Ho, kola! I shall touch the door-flap as softly as the swallow alights\nupon her nest. But I warn you, do not let your heart beat too loudly,\nfor the old woman’s ears are still good!”\n\nSo, joking and laughing, they proceed toward a large buffalo tent with a\nhorse’s tail suspended from the highest pole to indicate the rank of\nthe owner. They have ceased to blow the flute some paces back, and walk\nnoiselessly as a panther in quest of a doe.\n\nBrave Elk opens the door. Matosapa enters the tent. As was the wont of\nthe Sioux, the well-born maid has a little teepee within a teepee--a\nprivate apartment of her own. He passes the sleeping family to this\ninner shrine. There he gently wakens Winona with proper apologies. This\nis not unusual or strange to her innocence, for it was the custom of the\npeople. He sits at the door, while his friend waits outside, and tells\nhis love in a whisper. To this she does not reply at once; even if she\nloves him, it is proper that she should be silent. The lover does not\nknow whether he is favorably received or not, upon this his first visit.\nHe must now seek her outside upon every favorable occasion. No gifts\nare offered at this stage of the affair; the trafficking in ponies and\n“buying” a wife is entirely a modern custom.\n\nMatosapa has improved every opportunity, until Winona has at last\nshyly admitted her willingness to listen. For a whole year he has been\ncompelled at intervals to repeat the story of his love. Through the\nautumn hunting of the buffalo and the long, cold winter he often\npresents her kinsfolk with his game.\n\nAt the next midsummer the parents on both sides are made acquainted\nwith the betrothal, and they at once begin preparations for the coming\nwedding. Provisions and delicacies of all kinds are laid aside for\na feast. Matosapa’s sisters and his girl cousins are told of the\napproaching event, and they too prepare for it, since it is their duty\nto dress or adorn the bride with garments made by their own hands.\n\nWith the Sioux of the old days, the great natural crises of human life,\nmarriage and birth, were considered sacred and hedged about with great\nprivacy. Therefore the union is publicly celebrated after and not before\nits consummation. Suddenly the young couple disappear. They go out into\nthe wilderness together, and spend some days or weeks away from the\ncamp. This is their honeymoon, away from all curious or prying eyes. In\ndue time they quietly return, he to his home and she to hers, and now at\nlast the marriage is announced and invitations are given to the feast.\n\nThe bride is ceremoniously delivered to her husband’s people, together\nwith presents of rich clothing collected from all her clan, which she\nafterward distributes among her new relations. Winona is carried in a\ntravois handsomely decorated, and is received with equal ceremony.\nFor several days following she is dressed and painted by the female\nrelatives of the groom, each in her turn, while in both clans the\nwedding feast is celebrated.\n\nTo illustrate womanly nobility of nature, let me tell the story of\nDowanhotaninwin, Her-Singing-Heard. The maiden was deprived of both\nfather and mother when scarcely ten years old, by an attack of the Sacs\nand Foxes while they were on a hunting expedition. Left alone with her\ngrandmother, she was carefully reared and trained by this sage of the\nwild life.\n\nNature had given her more than her share of attractiveness, and she was\nwomanly and winning as she was handsome. Yet she remained unmarried for\nnearly thirty years--a most unusual thing among us; and although she had\nworthy suitors in every branch of the Sioux nation, she quietly refused\nevery offer.\n\nCertain warriors who had distinguished themselves against the particular\ntribe who had made her an orphan, persistently sought her hand in\nmarriage, but failed utterly.\n\nOne summer the Sioux and the Sacs and Foxes were brought together under\na flag of truce by the Commissioners of the Great White Father, for\nthe purpose of making a treaty with them. During the short period of\nfriendly intercourse and social dance and feast, a noble warrior of the\nenemy’s tribe courted Dowanhotaninwin.\n\nSeveral of her old lovers were vying with one another to win her at the\nsame time, that she might have inter-tribal celebration of her wedding.\n\nBehold! the maiden accepted the foe of her childhood--one of those who\nhad cruelly deprived her of her parents!\n\nBy night she fled to the Sac and Fox camp with her lover. It seemed at\nfirst an insult to the Sioux, and there was almost an outbreak among the\nyoung men of the tribe, who were barely restrained by their respect for\nthe Commissioners of the Great Father.\n\nBut her aged grandfather explained the matter publicly in this fashion:\n\n“Young men, hear ye! Your hearts are strong; let them not be troubled\nby the act of a young woman of your tribe! This has been her secret wish\nsince she became a woman. She deprecates all tribal warfare. Her young\nheart never forgot its early sorrow; yet she has never blamed the Sacs\nand Foxes or held them responsible for the deed. She blames rather\nthe customs of war among us. She believes in the formation of a blood\nbrotherhood strong enough to prevent all this cruel and useless enmity.\nThis was her high purpose, and to this end she reserved her hand.\nForgive her, forgive her, I pray!”\n\nIn the morning there was a great commotion. The herald of the Sacs and\nFoxes entered the Sioux camp, attired in ceremonial garb and bearing\nin one hand an American flag and in the other a peace-pipe. He made\nthe rounds singing a peace song, and delivering to all an invitation to\nattend the wedding feast of Dowanhotaninwin and their chief’s son. Thus\nall was well. The simplicity, high purpose, and bravery of the girl won\nthe hearts of the two tribes, and as long as she lived she was able to\nkeep the peace between them.\n\n\n\n\nIII. SNANA’S FAWN\n\nThe Little Missouri was in her spring fullness, and the hills among\nwhich she found her way to the Great Muddy were profusely adorned with\ncolors, much like those worn by the wild red man upon a holiday!\nLooking toward the sunrise, one saw mysterious, deep shadows and bright\nprominences, while on the opposite side there was really an extravagant\narray of variegated hues. Between the gorgeous buttes and rainbow-tinted\nridges there were narrow plains, broken here and there by dry creeks\nor gulches, and these again were clothed scantily with poplars and\nsad-colored bull-berry bushes, while the bare spots were purple with the\nwild Dakota crocuses.\n\nUpon the lowest of a series of natural terraces there stood on this May\nmorning a young Sioux girl, whose graceful movements were not unlike\nthose of a doe which chanced to be lurking in a neighboring gulch. On\nthe upper plains, not far away, were her young companions, all busily\nemployed with the wewoptay, as it was called--the sharp-pointed stick\nwith which the Sioux women dig wild turnips. They were gayly gossiping\ntogether, or each humming a love-song as she worked, only Snana stood\nsomewhat apart from the rest; in fact, concealed by the crest of the\nridge.\n\nShe had paused in her digging and stood facing the sun-kissed buttes.\nAbove them in the clear blue sky the father sun was traveling upward as\nin haste, while to her receptive spirit there appealed an awful, unknown\nforce, the silent speech of the Great Mystery, to which it seemed to her\nthe whole world must be listening!\n\n“O Great Mystery! the father of earthly things is coming to quicken\nus into life. Have pity on me, I pray thee! May I some day become the\nmother of a great and brave race of warriors!” So the maiden prayed\nsilently.\n\nIt was now full-born day. The sun shone hot upon the bare ground, and\nthe drops stood upon Snana’s forehead as she plied her long pole. There\nwas a cool spring in the dry creek bed near by, well hidden by a clump\nof chokecherry bushes, and she turned thither to cool her thirsty\nthroat. In the depths of the ravine her eye caught a familiar\nfootprint--the track of a doe with the young fawn beside it. The hunting\ninstinct arose within.\n\n“It will be a great feat if I can find and take from her the babe. The\nlittle tawny skin shall be beautifully dressed by my mother. The legs\nand the nose shall be embossed with porcupine quills. It will be my\nwork-bag,” she said to herself.\n\nAs she stole forward on the fresh trail she scanned every nook, every\nclump of bushes. There was a sudden rustle from within a grove of wild\nplum trees, thickly festooned with grape and clematis, and the doe\nmother bounded away as carelessly as if she were never to return.\n\nAh, a mother’s ruse! Snana entered the thorny enclosure, which was\nalmost a rude teepee, and, tucked away in the furthermost corner, lay\nsomething with a trout-like, speckled, tawny coat. She bent over it.\nThe fawn was apparently sleeping. Presently its eyes moved a bit, and a\nshiver passed through its subtle body.\n\n“Thou shalt not die; thy skin shall not become my work-bag!”\n unconsciously the maiden spoke. The mother sympathy had taken hold on\nher mind. She picked the fawn up tenderly, bound its legs, and put it on\nher back to carry like an Indian babe in the folds of her robe.\n\n“I cannot leave you alone, Tachinchala. Your mother is not here. Our\nhunters will soon return by this road, and your mother has left behind\nher two plain tracks leading to this thicket,” she murmured.\n\nThe wild creature struggled vigorously for a minute, and then became\nquiet. Its graceful head protruded from the elkskin robe just over\nSnana’s shoulder. She was slowly climbing the slope with her burden,\nwhen suddenly like an apparition the doe-mother stood before her. The\nfawn called loudly when it was first seized, and the mother was not too\nfar away to hear. Now she called frantically for her child, at the same\ntime stamping with her delicate fore-feet.\n\n“Yes, sister, you are right; she is yours; but you cannot save her\nto-day! The hunters will soon be here. Let me keep her for you; I will\nreturn her to you safely. And hear me, O sister of the woods, that some\nday I may become the mother of a noble race of warriors and of fine\nwomen, as handsome as you are!”\n\nAt this moment the quick eyes of the Indian girl detected something\nstrange in the doe’s actions. She glanced in every direction and behold!\na grizzly bear was cautiously approaching the group from a considerable\ndistance.\n\n“Run, run, sister! I shall save your child if I can,” she cried, and\nflew for the nearest scrub oak on the edge of the bank. Up the tree she\nscrambled, with the fawn still securely bound to her back. The grizzly\ncame on with teeth exposed, and the doe-mother in her flight came\nbetween him and the tree, giving a series of indignant snorts as she\nran, and so distracted Mato from his object of attack; but only for a\nfew seconds--then on he came!\n\n“Desist, O brave Mato! It does not become a great medicine-man to attack\na helpless woman with a burden upon her back!”\n\nSnana spoke as if the huge brute could understand her, and indeed the\nIndians hold that wild animals understand intuitively when appealed to\nby human beings in distress. Yet he replied only with a hoarse growl, as\nrising upon his hind legs he shook the little tree vigorously.\n\n“Ye, ye, heyupi ye!” Snana called loudly to her companion\nturnip-diggers. Her cry soon brought all the women into sight upon a\nnear-by ridge, and they immediately gave a general alarm. Mato saw them,\nbut appeared not at all concerned and was still intent upon dislodging\nthe girl, who clung frantically to her perch.\n\nPresently there appeared upon the little knoll several warriors, mounted\nand uttering the usual war-whoop, as if they were about to swoop down\nupon a human enemy. This touched the dignity of Mato, and he immediately\nprepared to accept the challenge. Every Indian was alive to the\npossibilities of the occasion, for it is well known that Mato, or\ngrizzly bear, alone among animals is given the rank of a warrior, so\nthat whoever conquers him may wear an eagle feather.\n\n“Woo! woo!” the warriors shouted, as they maneuvered to draw him into\nthe open plain.\n\nHe answered with hoarse growls, threatening a rider who had ventured\ntoo near. But arrows were many and well-aimed, and in a few minutes the\ngreat and warlike Mato lay dead at the foot of the tree.\n\nThe men ran forward and counted their coups on him, just as when an\nenemy is fallen. Then they looked at one another and placed their hands\nover their mouths as the young girl descended the tree with a fawn bound\nupon her back.\n\n“So that was the bait!” they cried. “And will you not make a feast with\nthat fawn for us who came to your rescue?”\n\n“The fawn is young and tender, and we have not eaten meat for two days.\nIt will be a generous thing to do,” added her father, who was among\nthem.\n\n“Ye-e-e!” she cried out in distress. “Do not ask it! I have seen this\nfawn’s mother. I have promised to keep her child safe. See! I have saved\nits life, even when my own was in danger.”\n\n“Ho, ho, wakan ye lo! (Yes, yes, ‘tis holy or mysterious),” they\nexclaimed approvingly.\n\nIt was no small trouble for Snana to keep her trust. As may well be\nsupposed, all the dogs of the teepee village must be watched and kept\nat a distance. Neither was it easy to feed the little captive; but in\ngaining its confidence the girl was an adept. The fawn soon followed her\neverywhere, and called to her when hungry exactly as she had called to\nher own mother.\n\nAfter several days, when her fright at the encounter with the bear had\nsomewhat worn off, Snana took her pet into the woods and back to the\nvery spot in which she had found it. In the furthest corner of the\nwild plum grove she laid it down, gently stroked its soft forehead, and\nsmoothed the leaflike ears. The little thing closed its eyes. Once more\nthe Sioux girl bent over and laid her cheek against the fawn’s head;\nthen reluctantly she moved away, hoping and yet dreading that the mother\nwould return. She crouched under a clump of bushes near by, and gave the\ndoe call. It was a reckless thing for her to do, for such a call might\nbring upon her a mountain lion or ever-watchful silvertip; but Snana did\nnot think of that.\n\nIn a few minutes she heard the light patter of hoofs, and caught a\nglimpse of a doe running straight toward the fawn’s hiding-place. When\nshe stole near enough to see, the doe and the fawn were examining one\nanother carefully, as if fearing some treachery. At last both were\napparently satisfied. The doe caressed her natural child, and the little\none accepted the milk she offered.\n\nIn the Sioux maiden’s mind there was turmoil. A close attachment to the\nlittle wild creature had already taken root there, contending with the\nsense of justice that was strong within her. Now womanly sympathy for\nthe mother was in control, and now a desire to possess and protect her\nhelpless pet.\n\n“I can take care of her against all hunters, both animal and human. They\nare ever ready to seize the helpless fawn for food. Her life will be\noften exposed. You cannot save her from disaster. O, Takcha, my sister,\nlet me still keep her for you!” she finally appealed to the poor doe,\nwho was nervously watching the intruder, and apparently thinking how she\nmight best escape with the fawn.\n\nJust at this moment there came a low call from the wood. It was a doe\ncall; but the wild mother and her new friend both knew that it was not\nthe call of a real doe.\n\n“It is a Sioux hunter!” whispered the girl. “You must go, my sister! Be\noff; I will take your child to safety!”\n\nWhile she was yet speaking, the doe seemed to realize the danger. She\nstopped only an instant to lick fondly the tawny coat of the little one,\nwho had just finished her dinner; then she bounded away.\n\nAs Snana emerged from the bushes with her charge, a young hunter met her\nface to face, and stared at her curiously. He was not of her father’s\ncamp, but a stranger.\n\n“Ugh, you have my game.”\n\n“Tosh!” she replied coquettishly.\n\nIt was so often said among the Indians that the doe was wont to put on\nhuman form to mislead the hunter, that it looked strange to see a woman\nwith a fawn, and the young man could not forbear to gaze upon Snana.\n\n“You are not the real mother in maiden’s guise? Tell me truly if you are\nof human blood,” he demanded rudely.\n\n“I am a Sioux maiden! Do you not know my father?” she replied.\n\n“Ah, but who is your father? What is his name?” he insisted, nervously\nfingering his arrows.\n\n“Do not be a coward! Surely you should know a maid of your own race,”\n she replied reproachfully.\n\n“Ah, you know the tricks of the doe! What is thy name?”\n\n“Hast thou forgotten the etiquette of thy people, and wouldst compel me\nto pronounce my own name? I refuse; thou art jesting!” she retorted with\na smile.\n\n“Thou dost give the tricky answers of a doe. I cannot wait; I must act\nbefore I lose my natural mind. But already I am yours. Whatever purpose\nyou may have in thus charming a poor hunter, be merciful,” and, throwing\naside his quiver, he sat down.\n\nThe maiden stole a glance at his face, and then another. He was\nhandsome. Softly she reentered the thicket and laid down the little\nfawn.\n\n“Promise me never to hunt here again!” she said earnestly, as she came\nforth without her pretty burden, and he exacted another promise in\nreturn. Thus Snana lost her fawn, and found a lover.\n\n\n\n\nIV. SHE-WHO-HAS-A-SOUL\n\nIt was a long time ago, nearly two hundred years ago, that some of our\npeople were living upon the shores of the Great Lake, Lake Superior. The\nchief of this band was called Tatankaota, Many Buffaloes.\n\nOne day the young son of Tatankaota led a war-party against the\nOjibways, who occupied the country east of us, toward the rising sun.\n\nWhen they had gone a day’s journey in the direction of Sault Ste. Marie,\nin our language Skesketatanka, the warriors took up their position on\nthe lake shore, at a point which the Ojibways were accustomed to pass in\ntheir canoes.\n\nLong they gazed, and scanned the surface of the water, watching for\nthe coming of the foe. The sun had risen above the dark pines, over\nthe great ridge of woodland across the bay. It was the awakening of all\nliving things. The birds were singing, and shining fishes leaped out of\nthe water as if at play. At last, far off, there came the warning cry of\nthe loon to stir their expectant ears.\n\n“Warriors, look close to the horizon! This brother of ours does not lie.\nThe enemy comes!” exclaimed their leader.\n\nPresently upon the sparkling face of the water there appeared a moving\ncanoe. There was but one, and it was coming directly toward them.\n\n“Hahatonwan! Hahatonwan! (The Ojibways! the Ojibways!)” they exclaimed\nwith one voice, and, grasping their weapons, they hastily concealed\nthemselves in the bushes.\n\n“Spare none--take no captives!” ordered the chief’s son.\n\nNearer and nearer approached the strange canoe. The glistening blades\nof its paddles flashed as it were the signal of good news, or a\nwelcome challenge. All impatiently waited until it should come within\narrow-shot.\n\n“Surely it is an Ojibway canoe,” one murmured. “Yet look! the stroke is\nungainly!” Now, among all the tribes only the Ojibway’s art is perfect\nin paddling a birch canoe. This was a powerful stroke, but harsh and\nunsteady.\n\n“See! there are no feathers on this man’s head!” exclaimed the son\nof the chief. “Hold, warriors, he wears a woman’s dress, and I see\nno weapon. No courage is needed to take his life, therefore let it be\nspared! I command that only coups (or blows) be counted on him, and he\nshall tell us whence he comes, and on what errand.”\n\nThe signal was given; the warriors sprang to their feet, and like wolves\nthey sped from the forest, out upon the white, sandy beach and straight\ninto the sparkling waters of the lake, giving the shrill war-cry, the\nwarning of death!\n\nThe solitary oarsman made no outcry--he offered no defense! Kneeling\ncalmly in the prow of the little vessel, he merely ceased paddling and\nseemed to await with patience the deadly blow of the tomahawk.\n\nThe son of Tatankaota was foremost in the charge, but suddenly an\nimpulse seized him to stop his warriors, lest one in the heat of\nexcitement should do a mischief to the stranger. The canoe with its\noccupant was now very near, and it could be seen that the expression of\nhis face was very gentle and even benignant. None could doubt his utter\nharmlessness; and the chief’s son afterward declared that at this moment\nhe felt a premonition of some event, but whether good or evil he could\nnot tell.\n\nNo blows were struck--no coups counted. The young man bade his warriors\ntake up the canoe and carry it to the shore; and although they murmured\nsomewhat among themselves, they did as he commanded them. They seized\nthe light bark and bore it dripping to a hill covered with tall pines,\nand overlooking the waters of the Great Lake.\n\nThen the warriors lifted their war-clubs over their heads and sang,\nstanding around the canoe in which the black-robed stranger was still\nkneeling. Looking at him closely, they perceived that he was of a\npeculiar complexion, pale and inclined to red. He wore a necklace of\nbeads, from which hung a cross bearing the form of a man. His garments\nwere strange, and most like the robes of woman. All of these things\nperplexed them greatly.\n\nPresently the Black Robe told them by signs, in response to their\ninquiries, that he came from the rising sun, even beyond the Great Salt\nWater, and he seemed to say that he formerly came from the sky. Upon\nthis the warriors believed that he must be a prophet or mysterious man.\n\nTheir leader directed them to take up again the canoe with the man in\nit, and appointed the warriors to carry it by turns until they should\nreach his father’s village. This was done according to the ancient\ncustom, as a mark of respect and honor. They took it up forthwith, and\ntraveled with all convenient speed along the lake shore, through forests\nand across streams to a place called the Maiden’s Retreat, a short\ndistance from the village.\n\nThence the chief’s son sent a messenger to announce to his father that\nhe was bringing home a stranger, and to ask whether or not he should be\nallowed to enter the village. “His appearance,” declared the scout, “is\nunlike that of any man we have ever seen, and his ways are mysterious!”\n\nWhen the chief heard these words, he immediately called his council-men\ntogether to decide what was to be done, for he feared by admitting the\nmysterious stranger to bring some disaster upon his people. Finally he\nwent out with his wisest men to meet his son’s war-party. They looked\nwith astonishment upon the Black Robe.\n\n“Dispatch him! Dispatch him! Show him no mercy!” cried some of the\ncouncil-men.\n\n“Let him go on his way unharmed. Trouble him not,” advised others.\n\n“It is well known that the evil spirits sometimes take the form of a man\nor animal. From his strange appearance I judge this to be such a one.\nHe should be put to death, lest some harm befall our people,” an old man\nurged.\n\nBy this time several of the women of the village had reached the spot.\nAmong them was She-who-has-a-Soul, the chief’s youngest daughter, who\ntradition says was a maiden of much beauty, and of a generous heart. The\nstranger was evidently footsore from much travel and\n\nweakened by fasting. When she saw that the poor man clasped his hands\nand looked skyward as he uttered words in an unknown tongue, she pleaded\nwith her father that a stranger who has entered their midst unchallenged\nmay claim the hospitality of the people, according to the ancient\ncustom.\n\n“Father, he is weary and in want of food. Hold him no longer! Delay\nyour council until he is refreshed!” These were the words of\nShe-who-has-a-Soul, and her father could not refuse her prayer. The\nBlack Robe was released, and the Sioux maiden led him to her father’s\nteepee.\n\nNow the warriors had been surprised and indeed displeased to find him\ndressed after the fashion of a woman, and they looked upon him with\nsuspicion. But from the moment that she first beheld him, the heart of\nthe maiden had turned toward this strange and seemingly unfortunate man.\nIt appeared to her that great reverence and meekness were in his face,\nand with it all she was struck by his utter fearlessness, his apparent\nunconsciousness of danger.\n\nThe chief’s daughter, having gained her father’s permission, invited the\nBlack Robe to his great buffalo-skin tent, and spreading a fine robe,\nshe gently asked him to be seated. With the aid of her mother, she\nprepared wild rice sweetened with maple sugar and some broiled venison\nfor his repast. The youthful warriors were astonished to observe these\nattentions, but the maiden heeded them not. She anointed the blistered\nfeet of the holy man with perfumed otter oil, and put upon him a pair of\nmoccasins beautifully worked by her own hands.\n\nIt was only an act of charity on her part, but the young men were\ndispleased, and again urged that the stranger should at once be turned\naway. Some even suggested harsher measures; but they were overruled by\nthe chief, softened by the persuasions of a well-beloved daughter.\n\nDuring the few days that the Black Robe remained in the Sioux village he\npreached earnestly to the maiden, for she had been permitted to converse\nwith him by signs, that she might try to ascertain what manner of man he\nwas. He told her of the coming of a “Great Prophet” from the sky, and of\nhis words that he had left with the people. The cross with the figure of\na man he explained as his totem which he had told them to carry. He also\nsaid that those who love him are commanded to go among strange peoples\nto tell the news, and that all who believe must be marked with holy\nwater and accept the totem.\n\nHe asked by signs if She-who-has-a-Soul believed the story. To this she\nreplied:\n\n“It is a sweet story--a likely legend! I do believe!”\n\nThen the good father took out a small cross, and having pressed it\nto his heart and crossed his forehead and breast, he gave it to her.\nFinally he dipped his finger in water and touched the forehead of the\nmaiden, repeating meanwhile some words in an unknown tongue.\n\nThe mother was troubled, for she feared that the stranger was trying to\nbewitch her daughter, but the chief decided thus:\n\n“This is a praying-man, and he is not of our people; his customs are\ndifferent, but they are not evil. Warriors, take him back to the spot\nwhere you saw him first! It is my desire, and the good custom of our\ntribe requires that you free him without injury!”\n\nAccordingly they formed a large party, and carried the Black Robe in his\ncanoe back to the shore of the Great Lake, to the place where they had\nmet him, and he was allowed to depart thence whithersoever he would.\nHe took his leave with signs of gratitude for their hospitality, and\nespecially for the kindness of the beautiful Sioux maiden. She seemed to\nhave understood his mission better than any one else, and as long as\nshe lived she kept his queer trinket--as it seemed to the others--and\nperformed the strange acts that he had taught her.\n\nFurthermore, it was through the pleadings of She-who-has-a-Soul that the\nchief Tatankaota advised his people in after days to befriend the white\nstrangers, and though many of the other chiefs opposed him in this,\nhis counsels prevailed. Hence it was that both the French and English\nreceived much kindness from our people, mainly through the influence of\nthis one woman!\n\nSuch was the first coming of the white man among us, as it is told in\nour traditions. Other praying-men came later, and many of the Sioux\nallowed themselves to be baptized. True, there have been Indian wars,\nbut not without reason; and it is pleasant to remember that the Sioux\nwere hospitable to the first white “prayingman,” and that it was a\ntender-hearted maiden of my people who first took in her hands the cross\nof the new religion.\n\n\n\n\nV. THE PEACE-MAKER\n\nOne of the most remarkable women of her day and nation was Eyatonkawee,\nShe-whose-Voice-is-heard-afar. It is matter of history among the\nWakpaykootay band of Sioux, the Dwellers among the Leaves, that\nwhen Eyatonkawee was a very young woman she was once victorious in a\nhand-to-hand combat with the enemy in the woods of Minnesota, where her\npeople were hunting the deer. At such times they often met with stray\nparties of Sacs and Foxes from the prairies of Iowa and Illinois.\n\nNow, the custom was among our people that the doer of a notable warlike\ndeed was held in highest honor, and these deeds were kept constantly in\nmemory by being recited in public, before many witnesses. The greatest\nexploit was that one involving most personal courage and physical\naddress, and he whose record was adjudged best might claim certain\nprivileges, not the least of which was the right to interfere in any\nquarrel and separate the combatants. The peace-maker might resort to\nforce, if need be, and no one dared to utter a protest who could not say\nthat he had himself achieved an equal fame.\n\nThere was a man called Tamahay, known to Minnesota history as the\n“One-eyed Sioux,” who was a notable character on the frontier in the\nearly part of the nineteenth century. He was very reckless, and could\nboast of many a perilous adventure. He was the only Sioux who, in the\nWar of 1812, fought for the Americans, while all the rest of his people\nsided with the British, mainly through the influence of the English\ntraders among them at that time. This same “One-eyed Sioux” became\na warm friend of Lieutenant Pike, who discovered the sources of the\nMississippi, and for whom Pike’s Peak is named. Some say that the Indian\ntook his friend’s name, for Tamahay in English means Pike or Pickerel.\n\nUnfortunately, in later life this brave man became a drunkard, and after\nthe Americans took possession of his country almost any one of them\nwould supply him with liquor in recognition of his notable services as\na scout and soldier. Thus he was at times no less dangerous in camp than\nin battle.\n\nNow, Eyatonkawee, being a young widow, had married the son of a lesser\nchief in Tamahay’s band, and was living among strangers. Moreover, she\nwas yet young and modest.\n\nOne day this bashful matron heard loud warwhoops and the screams of\nwomen. Looking forth, she saw the people fleeing hither and thither,\nwhile Tamahay, half intoxicated, rushed from his teepee painted for war,\narmed with tomahawk and scalping-knife, and approached another warrior\nas if to slay him. At this sight her heart became strong, and she\nquickly sprang between them with her woman’s knife in her hand.\n\n“It was a Sac warrior of like proportions and bravery with your own,\nwho, having slain several of the Sioux, thus approached me with uplifted\ntomahawk!” she exclaimed in a clear voice, and went on to recite her\nvictory on that famous day so that the terrified people paused to hear.\n\nTamahay was greatly astonished, but he was not too drunk to realize that\nhe must give way at once, or be subject to the humiliation of a blow\nfrom the woman-warrior who challenged him thus. The whole camp was\nlistening; and being unable, in spite of his giant frame and well-known\nrecord, to cite a greater deed than hers, he retreated with as good a\ngrace as possible. Thus Eyatonkawee recounted her brave deed for the\nfirst time, in order to save a man’s life. From that day her name was\ngreat as a peace-maker--greater even than when she had first defended so\ngallantly her babe and home!\n\nMany years afterward, when she had attained middle age, this woman\naverted a serious danger from her people.\n\nChief Little Crow the elder was dead, and as he had two wives of two\ndifferent bands, the succession was disputed among the half-brothers\nand their adherents. Finally the two sons of the wife belonging to the\nWabashaw band plotted against the son of the woman of the Kaposia band,\nHis-Red-Nation by name, afterward called Little Crow--the man who led\nthe Minnesota massacre.\n\nThey obtained a quantity of whisky and made a great feast to which\nmany were invited, intending when all were more or less intoxicated\nto precipitate a fight in which he should be killed. It would be easy\nafterward to excuse themselves by saying that it was an accident.\n\nMendota, near what is now the thriving city of Saint Paul, then a queen\nof trading-posts in the Northwest, was the rendezvous of the Sioux. The\nevent brought many together, for all warriors of note were bidden from\nfar and near, and even the great traders of the day were present, for\nthe succession to the chieftainship was one which vitally affected their\ninterests. During the early part of the day all went well, with speeches\nand eulogies of the dead chief, flowing and eloquent, such as only a\nnative orator can utter. Presently two goodly kegs of whisky were rolled\ninto the council teepee.\n\nEyatonkawee was among the women, and heard their expressions of anxiety\nas the voices of the men rose louder and more threatening. Some carried\ntheir children away into the woods for safety, while others sought\nspeech with their husbands outside the council lodge and besought them\nto come away in time. But more than this was needed to cope with the\nemergency. Suddenly a familiar form appeared in the door of the council\nlodge.\n\n“Is it becoming in a warrior to spill the blood of his tribesmen? Are\nthere no longer any Ojibways?”\n\nIt was the voice of Eyatonkawee, that stronghearted woman! Advancing at\nthe critical moment to the middle of the ring of warriors, she once\nmore recited her “brave deed” with all the accompaniment of action\nand gesture, and to such effect that the disorderly feast broke up in\nconfusion, and there was peace between the rival bands of Sioux.\n\nThere was seldom a dangerous quarrel among the Indians in those days\nthat was not precipitated by the use of strong liquor, and this simple\nIndian woman, whose good judgment was equal to her courage, fully\nrecognized this fact. All her life, and especially after her favorite\nbrother had been killed in a drunken brawl in the early days of the\nAmerican Fur Company, she was a determined enemy to strong drink, and\nit is said did more to prevent its use among her immediate band than\nany other person. Being a woman, her sole means of recognition was the\n“brave deed” which she so wonderfully described and enacted before the\npeople.\n\nDuring the lifetime of She-whose-Voice-is-heard-afar--and she died only\na few years ago--it behooved the Sioux men, if they drank at all, to\ndrink secretly and in moderation. There are many who remember her brave\nentrance upon the scene of carousal, and her dramatic recital of the\nimmortal deed of her youth.\n\n“Hanta! hanta wo! (Out of the way!)” exclaim the dismayed warriors,\nscrambling in every direction to avoid the upraised arm of the terrible\nold woman, who bursts suddenly upon them with disheveled hair, her gown\ntorn and streaked here and there with what looks like fresh blood, her\nleather leggins loose and ungartered, as if newly come from the famous\nstruggle. One of the men has a keg of whisky for which he has given a\npony, and the others have been invited in for a night of pleasure. But\nscarcely has the first round been drunk to the toast of “great deeds,”\n when Eyatonkawee is upon them, her great knife held high in her wrinkled\nleft hand, her tomahawk in the right. Her black eyes gleam as she\ndeclaims in a voice strong, unterrified:\n\n   “Look! look! brothers and husbands--the Sacs and Foxes are upon us!\n\n   Behold, our braves are surprised--they are unprepared!\n\n   Hear the mothers, the wives and the children screaming in affright!\n\n   “Your brave sister, Eyatonkawee, she, the newly made mother,\n   is serving the smoking venison to her husband, just returned\n   from the chase!\n\n   Ah, he plunges into the thickest of the enemy!\n   He falls, he falls, in full view of his young wife!\n\n   “She desperately presses her babe to her breast,\n   while on they come yelling and triumphant!\n\n   The foremost of them all enters her white buffalo-skin teepee:\n   Tossing her babe at the warrior’s feet, she stands before him, defiant;\n   But he straightway levels his spear at her bosom.\n\n   Quickly she springs aside, and as quickly deals a deadly blow with\n   her ax:\n\n   Falls at her feet the mighty warrior!\n\n   “Closely following on comes another,\n   unknowing what fate has met his fellow!\n\n   He too enters her teepee, and upon his feather-decked head her ax falls\n   --Only his death-groan replies!\n\n   “Another of heroic size and great prowess,\n   as witnessed by his war-bonnet of eagle-feathers,\n\n   Rushes on, yelling and whooping--for they believe\n   that victory is with them!\n\n   The third great warrior who has dared to enter Eyatonkawee’s\n   teepee uninvited, he has already dispatched her husband!\n\n   He it is whose terrible war-cry has scattered her sisters\n   among the trees of the forest!\n\n   “On he comes with confidence and a brave heart,\n   seeking one more bloody deed-\n   One more feather to win for his head!\n   Behold, he lifts above her woman’s head his battle-ax!\n   No hope, no chance for her life!...\n   Ah! he strikes beyond her--only the handle of the ax falls\n   heavily upon her tired shoulder!\n\n   Her ready knife finds his wicked heart,--\n   Down he falls at her feet!\n\n   “Now the din of war grows fainter and further.\n   The Sioux recover heart, and drive the enemy headlong from their lodges:\n   Your sister stands victorious over three!\n   “She takes her baby boy, and makes him count with his tiny\n   hands the first ‘coup’ on each dead hero;\n\n   Hence he wears the ‘first feathers’ while yet in his oaken cradle.\n\n   “The bravest of the whole Sioux nation have given the war-whoop\n   in your sister’s honor, and have said:\n\n   ‘Tis Eyatonkawee who is not satisfied with downing\n   the mighty oaks with her ax--\n   She took the mighty Sacs and Foxes for trees,\n   and she felled them with a will!’”\n\nIn such fashion the old woman was wont to chant her story, and not a\nwarrior there could tell one to surpass it! The custom was strong, and\nthere was not one to prevent her when she struck open with a single blow\nof her ax the keg of whisky, and the precious liquor trickled upon the\nground.\n\n“So trickles under the ax of Eyatonkawee the blood of an enemy to the\nSioux!”\n\n\n\n\nVI. BLUE SKY\n\nMany years ago a large body of the Sioux were encamped at midsummer\nin the valley of the Cheyenne. It was customary at that period for\nthe Indians to tie up their ponies over night within the circle of the\nteepees, whenever they were in disputed territory, for they considered\nit no wrong to steal the horses of the enemy. Hence this long procession\nof young men and maidens, returning at sunset to the camp with great\nbundles of green grass hanging gracefully from their saddles!\n\nThe “green grass parade” became a regular custom, and in fact a\nfull-dress affair, since it was found to afford unusual opportunities\nfor courtship.\n\nBlue Sky, the pretty daughter of the Sioux chief, put on her best\ndoeskin gown trimmed with elks’ teeth, and investing her favorite\nspotted pony with his beaded saddle-blanket, she went forth in company\nwith one of her maiden friends. Soon two young warriors overtook the\npair; and as they approached they covered their heads with their robes,\nexposing only the upper part of the face disguised with paint and the\nsingle eagle feather standing upright. One carried a bow and quiver full\nof arrows; the other, a war-club suspended from his right arm.\n\n“Ah, hay, hun, hay!” saluted one of them; but the modest maidens said\nnever a word! It was not their way to speak; only the gay calico ponies\npranced about and sportively threw back their ears to snap at the horses\nof the two young men.\n\n“‘Tis a brave welcome your horses are giving us!” he continued, while\nthe two girls merely looked at one another with perfect understanding.\n\nPresently Matoska urged his pony close to the Blue Sky’s side.\n\n“It may be that I am overbold,” he murmured in her ear, “to repeat so\nsoon my tale of love! I know well that I risk a reprimand, if not in\nwords, then by a look or action!”\n\nHe paused to note the effect of his speech; but alas! it is the hard\nrule of savage courtship that the maiden may with propriety and dignity\nkeep silence as long as she wishes, and it is often exasperatingly long.\n\n“I have spoken to no maiden,” he resumed, “because I wished to win the\nwar-bonnet before doing so. But to you I was forced to yield!” Again\nhe paused, as if fearing to appear unduly hasty; but deliberate as were\nspeech and manner, his eyes betrayed him. They were full of intense\neagerness mingled with anxiety.\n\n“Sometimes I have imagined that I am in the world with you alone,\ntraveling over the prairie of life, or sitting in our lonely white\nteepee, as the oriole sits with his mate before their swaying home. Yet\nI seemed to be never lonely, because you were there!” He finished his\nplea, and with outward calmness awaited her reply.\n\nThe maiden had not lost a word, but she was still thinking. She thought\nthat a man is much like the wind of the north, only pleasant and\ncomfortable in midsummer! She feared that she might some time have to\nfurnish all the fuel for their love’s fires; therefore she held her\npeace. Matoska waited for several minutes and then silently withdrew,\nbearing his disappointment with dignity.\n\nMeanwhile the camp was astir with the returning youths and maidens,\ntheir horses’ sides fringed with the long meadow grass, singing\nplaintive serenades around the circular rows of teepees before they\nbroke up for the night.\n\nIt was a clear and quiet night; the evening fires were kindled and every\nteepee transformed into an immense Chinese lantern. There was a glowing\nring two miles in circumference, with the wooded river bottom on one\nside and the vast prairie on the other. The Black Hills loomed up in the\ndistance, and the rapids of the wild Cheyenne sent forth a varying peal\nof music on the wind. The people enjoyed their evening meal, and in the\npauses of their talk and laughter the ponies could be heard munching at\nthe bundles of green grass just outside the teepees.\n\nSuddenly a chorus of yells broke cruelly the peace of the camp, followed\nby the dashing charge of the Crow Indian horsemen! It was met as bravely\nand quickly by the Sioux; and in the clear, pale moonlight the dusky\nwarriors fought, with the occasional flash of a firearm, while silent\nweapons flew thick in the air like dragon-flies at sunset.\n\nThe brave mothers, wives, and sisters gave their shrill war-cry to\ninspire their men, and show the enemy that even the Sioux women cannot\nbe daunted by such a fearful surprise!\n\nWhen the morning sun sent its golden shafts among the teepees, they saw\nit through glistening tears--happy tears, they said, because the brave\ndead had met their end in gallant fight--the very end they craved! And\namong those who fell that night was Brave Hawk, the handsome brother of\nthe Blue Sky.\n\nIn a few days the camp was moved to a point further up the Cheyenne and\ndeeper into the bosom of the hills, leaving behind the decorated\ngrave lodges belonging to the honored dead. A great council teepee was\npitched, and here the people met to credit those who had earned them\nwith the honors of the fight, that they might thereafter wear the eagle\nfeathers which they had won.\n\n“The first honor,” declared the master of ceremonies, “belongs to Brave\nHawk, who fell in the battle! He it was who compelled the Crows to\nretreat, when he bravely charged upon them and knocked from his horse\nthe Crow chief, their war leader.”\n\n“Ho, it is true!” exclaimed the warriors in chorus.\n\n“The second honor,” he resumed, “belongs to Matoska, the White Bear!”\n\n“Hun, hun, hay!” interposed another, “it is I, Red Owl, who touched the\nbody of the Crow chief second to Brave Hawk!”\n\nIt was a definite challenge.\n\n“The warriors who witnessed the act give the coup to Matoska, friend!”\n persisted the spokesman.\n\nRed Owl was a brave youth and a close rival of Matoska, both for war\nhonors and for the hand of the prettiest maiden in the tribe. He had\nhoped to be recognized as one who fought in defense of their homes by\nthe side of Brave Hawk; that would please the Blue Sky, he thought; but\nthe honor was conferred upon his rival!\n\nThere was a cloud of suppressed irritation on his dusky face as he\nsullenly departed to his own tent--an action which displeased the\ncouncil-men. Matoska had not spoken, and this caused him to appear to\nthe better advantage. The worst of it was that Blue Sky herself\nhad entered the ring with the “orphan steed,” as it was called--the\nwar-horse of her dead brother, and had therefore seen and heard\neverything! Tanagila, or Hummingbird, the beautiful charger, decorated\naccording to custom with the honors won by his master, was led away by\nthe girl amidst resounding war-whoops.\n\nUnable to remain quiet, Red Owl went out into the hills to fast and\npray. It was sunset of the next day when he again approached the\nvillage, and behind a little ridge came suddenly upon Matoska and the\ngirl standing together. It was the first time that they had met since\nthe “green grass parade,” and now only by accident, as the sister of\nBrave Hawk was in deep mourning. However, the lover had embraced his\nopportunity, and the maiden had said that she was willing to think of\nthe matter. No more words were spoken.\n\nThat very night the council drum was struck three times, followed by the\nwarriors’ cheer. Everybody knew what that meant. It was an invitation to\nthe young men to go upon the war-path against the Crows!\n\nBlue Sky was unconsciously startled by this sudden announcement. For the\nfirst time in her life she felt a fear that she could not explain. The\ntruth was that she loved, and was not yet fully aware of it. In spite of\nher fresh grief, she had been inexplicably happy since her last meeting\nwith Matoska, for she had seen in him that which is so beautiful, so\ncompelling in man to the eyes of the woman who loves. He, too, now\ncherished a real hope, and felt as if he could rush into the thickest of\nthe battle to avenge the brother of his beloved!\n\nIn a few days the war-party had reached the Big Horn and sent out\nadvance scouts, who reported a large Crow encampment. Their hundreds of\nhorses covered the flats like a great herd of buffalo, they said. It was\nimmediately decided to attack at daybreak, and on a given signal they\ndashed impetuously upon the formidable camp. Some stampeded and drove\noff a number of horses, while the main body plunged into the midst of\nthe Crows.\n\nBut the enemy were not easily surprised. They knew well the Sioux\ntactics, and there was a desperate struggle for supremacy. War-club was\nraised against war-club, and the death-song of the arrow filled the\nair! Presently the Sioux were forced to retreat, with the Crows in hot\npursuit, like wolves after their prey.\n\nRed Owl and Matoska had been among the foremost in the charge, and\nnow they acted as a rear-guard, bravely defending the retreat of their\nlittle army, to the admiration of the enemy. At last a Crow raised his\nspear against Matoska, who in a flash dismounted him with a stroke of\nhis oaken bow; but alas! the blow snapped the bow-string and left him\ndefenseless. At the same instant his horse uttered a scream and fell,\nthrowing its rider headlong!\n\nThere was no one near except Red Owl, who clapped his heels to his pony\nand joined in the retreat, leaving Matoska behind. He arose, threw down\nhis quiver, and advanced alone to meet the oncoming rush of the Crows!\n\nThe Sioux had seen him fall. In a few moments he was surrounded by the\nenemy, and they saw him no more.\n\nThe pursuit was stopped, and they paused upon a hilltop to collect the\nremnant of their force. Red Owl was the last to come up, and it was\nobserved that he did not look like himself.\n\n“Tell us, what were Matoska’s last words?” they asked him.\n\nBut he silently dismounted and sent an arrow through his faithful steed,\nto the astonishment of the warriors. Immediately afterward he took out\nhis knife and stabbed himself to the heart.\n\n“Ah!” they exclaimed, “he could not live to share our humiliation!”\n\nThe war-party returned defeated and cast down by this unexpected ending\nto their adventure, having lost some of their bravest and best men. The\ncamp was instantly thrown into mourning. Many were in heavy grief, but\nnone was more deeply stricken than the maiden called the Blue Sky, the\ndaughter of their chief.\n\nShe remained within her teepee and wept in secret, for none knew that\nshe had the right to mourn. Yet she believed that her lover had met with\nmisfortune, but not death. Although his name was announced among those\nwarriors who fell in the field, her own heart assured her that it was\nnot so. “I must go to him,” she said to herself. “I must know certainly\nwhether he is still among the living!”\n\nThe next evening, while the village was yet in the confusion of great\ntrouble and sorrow, Blue Sky rode out upon her favorite pony as if to\ntake him to water as usual, but none saw her return! She hastened to\nthe spot where she had concealed two sacks of provisions and her extra\nmoccasins and materials for sewing. She had no weapon, save her knife\nand a small hatchet. She knew the country between the Black Hills and\nthe Big Horn, and knew that it was full of perils for man and much more\nfor woman. Yet by traveling only at night and concealing herself in the\ndaytime she hoped to avoid these dangers, and she rode bravely forth on\nthe trail of the returning warriors.\n\nHer dog, Wapayna, had followed the maiden, and she was not sorry to\nhave so faithful a companion. She cautioned him not to bark at or attack\nstrange animals unless they attacked first, and he seemed to understand\nthe propriety of remaining on guard whenever his mistress was asleep.\n\nShe reached the Powder River country in safety, and here she had more\nthan once to pick her way among the buffaloes. These wily animals seemed\nto realize that she was only a woman and unarmed, so that they scarcely\nkept out of her path. She also crossed the trails of riders, some of\nthem quite fresh, but was fortunate enough not to meet any of them.\n\nAt last the maiden attained the divide between the Tongue and the Big\nHorn rivers. Her heart beat fast, and the sudden sense of her strange\nmission almost overwhelmed her. She remembered the only time in her life\nthat the Sioux were upon that river, and so had that bit of friendly\nwelcome from the valley--a recollection of childhood!\n\nIt was near morning; the moon had set and for a short time darkness\nprevailed, but the girl’s eyes had by this time become accustomed to\nthe dark. She knew the day was at hand, and with its first beams she was\nsafely tucked into one of those round turns left by the river long ago\nin changing its bed, now become a little grassy hollow sheltered by\nsteep banks, and hidden by a fringe of trees. Here she picketed her\npony, and took her own rest. Not until the afternoon shadows were\nlong did she awake and go forth with determination to seek for the\nbattlefield and for the Crow encampment.\n\nIt was not long before she came upon the bodies of fallen horses and\nmen. There was Matoska’s white charger, with a Sioux arrow in his side,\nand she divined the treachery of Red Owl! But he was dead, and his death\nhad atoned for the crime. The body of her lover was nowhere to be found;\nyet how should they have taken the bravest of the Sioux a captive?\n\n“If he had but one arrow left, he would stand and fight! If his\nbow-string were broken, he would still welcome death with a strong\nheart,” she thought.\n\nThe evening was approaching and the Crow village in plain sight. Blue\nSky arranged her hair and dress as well as she could like that of a Crow\nwoman, and with an extra robe she made for herself a bundle that looked\nas if it held a baby in its many wrappings. The community was still\ncelebrating its recent victory over the Sioux, and the camp was alive\nwith songs and dances. In the darkness she approached unnoticed, and\nsinging in an undertone a Crow lullaby, walked back and forth among the\nlodges, watching eagerly for any signs of him she sought.\n\nAt last she came near to the council lodge. There she beheld his face\nlike an apparition through the dusk and the fire-light! He was sitting\nwithin, dressed in the gala costume of a Crow.\n\n“O, he is living! he is living!” thought the brave maiden. “O, what\nshall I do?” Unconsciously she crept nearer and nearer, until the sharp\neyes of an Indian detected the slight difference in her manner and\ndress, and he at once gave the alarm.\n\n“Wah, wah! Epsaraka! Epsaraka! A Sioux! A Sioux!”\n\nIn an instant the whole camp had surrounded the girl, who stood in their\nmidst a prisoner, yet undaunted, for she had seen her lover, and the\nspirit of her ancestors rose within her.\n\nAn interpreter was brought, a man who was half Crow and half Sioux.\n\n“Young and pretty daughter of the Sioux!” exclaimed the chief, “tell us\nhow you came here in our midst undetected, and why!”\n\n“Because,” replied the Blue Sky, “your brave warriors have slain my only\nbrother, and captured my lover, whom you now hold a prisoner. It is for\nhis sake that I have thus risked my life and honor!”\n\n“Ho, ho! You are the bravest woman I have ever seen. Your lover was\nbetrayed into our hands by the treachery of one of his own tribe, who\nshot his horse from behind. He faced us without fear, but it was not his\ncourage that saved his life. He resembles my own son, who lately fell in\nbattle, and according to the custom I have adopted him as my son!”\n\nThus the brave maiden captured the heart of the wily Crow, and was\nfinally allowed to return home with her lover, bearing many and rich\npresents. Her name is remembered among the two tribes, for this act of\nhers resulted in a treaty of peace between them which was kept for a\ngeneration.\n\n\n\n\nVII. THE FAITHFULNESS OF LONG EARS\n\nAway beyond the Thin Hills, above the Big Lone Tree upon the Powder\nRiver, the Uncpapa Sioux had celebrated their Sun Dance, some forty\nyears ago. It was midsummer and the red folk were happy. They lacked\nfor nothing. The yellowish green flat on either side of the Powder was\nstudded with wild flowers, and the cottonwood trees were in full leaf.\nOne large circle of buffalo skin teepees formed the movable village. The\nBig Horn Mountains loomed up against the deep blue sky to the westward,\nand the Black Hills appeared in the far southeast.\n\nThe tribal rites had all been observed, and the usual summer festivities\nenjoyed to the full. The camp as it broke up divided itself in three\nparts, each of which had determined to seek a favorite hunting-ground.\n\nOne band journeyed west, toward the Tongue River. One followed a\ntributary of the Powder to the south. The third merely changed camp, on\naccount of the grazing for ponies, and for four days remained near the\nold place.\n\nThe party that went west did not fail to realize the perilous nature\nof their wanderings, for they were trespassing upon the country of the\nwarlike Crows.\n\nOn the third day at sunrise, the Sioux crier’s voice resounded in the\nvalley of the Powder, announcing that the lodges must be razed and the\nvillagers must take up their march.\n\nBreakfast of jerked buffalo meat had been served and the women were\nadjusting their packs, not without much chatter and apparent confusion.\nWeeko (Beautiful Woman), the young wife of the war-chief Shunkaska, who\nhad made many presents at the dances in honor of her twin boys, now\ngave one of her remaining ponies to a poor old woman whose only beast of\nburden, a large dog, had died during the night.\n\nThis made it necessary to shift the packs of the others. Nakpa, or Long\nEars, her kittenlike gray mule, which had heretofore been honored with\nthe precious burden of the twin babies, was to be given a heavier and\nmore cumbersome load. Weeko’s two-year-old spotted pony was selected to\ncarry the babies.\n\nAccordingly, the two children, in their gorgeously beaded buckskin\nhoods, were suspended upon either side of the pony’s saddle. As Weeko’s\nfirst-born, they were beautifully dressed; even the saddle and bridle\nwere daintily worked by her own hands.\n\nThe caravan was now in motion, and Weeko started all her ponies after\nthe leader, while she adjusted the mule’s clumsy burden of kettles and\nother household gear. In a moment:\n\n“Go on, let us see how you move with your new load! Go on!” she\nexclaimed again, with a light blow of the horse-hair lariat, as the\nanimal stood perfectly still.\n\nNakpa simply gave an angry side glance at her load and shifted her\nposition once or twice. Then she threw herself headlong into the air and\nlanded stiff-legged, uttering at the same time her unearthly protest.\nFirst she dove straight through the crowd, then proceeded in a circle,\nher heels describing wonderful curves and sweeps in the air. Her\npack, too, began to come to pieces and to take forced flights from her\nundignified body and heels, in the midst of the screams of women and\nchildren, the barking of dogs, and the war-whoops of the amused young\nbraves.\n\nThe cowskin tent became detached from her saddle, and a moment later\nNakpa stood free. Her sides worked like a bellows as she stood there\nmeekly indignant, apparently considering herself to be the victim of an\nuncalled-for misunderstanding.\n\n“I should put an arrow through her at once, only she is not worth a\ngood arrow,” said Shunkaska, or White Dog, the husband of Weeko. At his\nwife’s answer, he opened his eyes in surprised displeasure.\n\n“No, she shall have her own pack again. She wants her twins. I ought\nnever to have taken them from her!”\n\nWeeko approached Nakpa as she stood alone and unfriended in the face\nof her little world, all of whom considered that she had committed the\nunpardonable sin. As for her, she evidently felt that her misfortunes\nhad not been of her own making. She gave a hesitating, sidelong look at\nher mistress.\n\n“Nakpa, you should not have acted so. I knew you were stronger than the\nothers, therefore I gave you that load,” said Weeko in a conciliatory\ntone, and patted her on the nose. “Come, now, you shall have your own\npet pack,” and she led her back to where the young pony stood silently\nwith the babies.\n\nNakpa threw back her ears and cast savage looks at him, while Shunkaska,\nwith no small annoyance, gathered together as much as he could of their\nscattered household effects. The sleeping brown-skinned babies in\ntheir chrysalis-like hoods were gently lowered from the pony’s back and\nattached securely to Nakpa’s padded wooden saddle. The family pots and\nkettles were divided among the pack ponies. Order was restored and the\nvillage once more in motion.\n\n“Come now, Nakpa; you have your wish. You must take good care of my\nbabies. Be good, because I have trusted you,” murmured the young mother\nin her softest tones.\n\n“Really, Weeko, you have some common ground with Nakpa, for you both\nalways want to have your own way, and stick to it, too! I tell you, I\nfear this Long Ears. She is not to be trusted with babies,” remarked\nShunkaska, with a good deal of severity. But his wife made no reply, for\nshe well knew that though he might criticise, he would not actually\ninterfere with her domestic arrangements.\n\nHe now started ahead to join the men in advance of the slow-moving\nprocession, thus leaving her in undivided charge of her household. One\nor two of the pack ponies were not well-trained and required all her\nattention. Nakpa had been a faithful servant until her escapade of\nthe morning, and she was now obviously satisfied with her mistress’\narrangements. She walked alongside with her lariat dragging, and\nperfectly free to do as she pleased.\n\nSome hours later, the party ascended a slope from the river bottom to\ncross over the divide which lay between the Powder River and a tributary\nstream. They had hitherto followed that river in a westerly direction,\nbut here it took its course southward, winding in a blue streak until\nlost to view among the foot-hills of the Big Horn Mountains. The ford\nwas deep, with a swift current. Here and there a bald butte stood out\nin full relief against the brilliant blue sky. The Sioux followed a deep\nravine until they came almost up to the second row of terraces.\n\n“Whoo! whoo!” came the blood-curdling signal of danger from the front.\nIt was no unfamiliar sound--the rovers knew it only too well. It meant\nsudden death--or at best a cruel struggle and frantic flight.\n\nTerrified, yet self-possessed, the women turned to fly while yet there\nwas time. Instantly the mother looked to Nakpa, who carried on either\nside of the saddle her precious boys. She hurriedly examined the\nfastenings to see that all was secure, and then caught her swiftest\npony, for, like all Indian women, she knew just what was happening, and\nthat while her husband was engaged in front with the enemy, she must\nseek safety with her babies.\n\nHardly was she in the saddle when a heartrending war-whoop sounded on\ntheir flank, and she knew that they were surrounded! Instinctively she\nreached for her husband’s second quiver of arrows, which was carried by\none of the pack ponies. Alas! the Crow warriors were already upon\nthem! The ponies became unmanageable, and the wild screams of women and\nchildren pierced the awful confusion.\n\nQuick as a flash, Weeko turned again to her babies, but Nakpa had\nalready disappeared!\n\nThen, maddened by fright and the loss of her children, Weeko became\nforgetful of her sex and tenderness, for she sternly grasped her\nhusband’s bow in her left hand to do battle.\n\nThat charge of the Crows was a disastrous one, but the Sioux were\nequally brave and desperate. Charges and counter-charges were made, and\nthe slain were many on both sides. The fight lasted until darkness came.\nThen the Crows departed and the Sioux buried their dead.\n\nWhen the Crows made their flank charge, Nakpa apparently appreciated the\nsituation. To save herself and the babies, she took a desperate chance.\nShe fled straight through the attacking force.\n\nWhen the warriors came howling upon her in great numbers, she at once\nstarted back the way she had come, to the camp left behind. They had\ntraveled nearly three days. To be sure, they did not travel more than\nfifteen miles a day, but it was full forty miles to cover before dark.\n\n“Look! look!” exclaimed a warrior, “two babies hung from the saddle of a\nmule!”\n\nNo one heeded this man’s call, and his arrow did not touch Nakpa or\neither of the boys, but it struck the thick part of the saddle over the\nmule’s back.\n\n“Lasso her! lasso her!” he yelled once more; but Nakpa was too cunning\nfor them. She dodged in and out with active heels, and they could not\nafford to waste many arrows on a mule at that stage of the fight. Down\nthe ravine, then over the expanse of prairie dotted with gray-green\nsage-brush, she sped with her unconscious burden.\n\n“Whoo! whoo!” yelled another Crow to his comrades, “the Sioux have\ndispatched a runner to get reinforcements! There he goes, down on the\nflat! Now he has almost reached the river bottom!”\n\nIt was only Nakpa. She laid back her cars and stretched out more and\nmore to gain the river, for she realized that when she had crossed the\nford the Crows would not pursue her farther.\n\nNow she had reached the bank. With the intense heat from her exertions,\nshe was extremely nervous, and she imagined a warrior behind every bush.\nYet she had enough sense left to realize that she must not satisfy her\nthirst. She tried the bottom with her fore-foot, then waded carefully\ninto the deep stream.\n\nShe kept her big ears well to the front as she swam to catch the\nslightest sound. As she stepped on the opposite shore, she shook herself\nand the boys vigorously, then pulled a few mouthfuls of grass and\nstarted on.\n\nSoon one of the babies began to cry, and the other was not long in\njoining him. Nakpa did not know what to do. She gave a gentle whinny and\nboth babies apparently stopped to listen; then she took up an easy gait\nas if to put them to sleep.\n\nThese tactics answered only for a time. As she fairly flew over the\nlowlands, the babies’ hunger increased and they screamed so loud that a\npassing coyote had to sit upon his haunches and wonder what in the world\nthe fleeing longeared horse was carrying on his saddle. Even magpies and\ncrows flew near as if to ascertain the meaning of this curious sound.\n\nNakpa now came to the Little Trail Creek, a tributary of the Powder, not\nfar from the old camp. No need of wasting any time here, she thought.\nThen she swerved aside so suddenly as almost to jerk her babies out\nof their cradles. Two gray wolves, one on each side, approached her,\ngrowling low--their white teeth showing.\n\nNever in her humble life had Nakpa been in more desperate straits. The\nlarger of the wolves came fiercely forward to engage her attention,\nwhile his mate was to attack her behind and cut her hamstrings. But for\nonce the pair had made a miscalculation. The mule used her front hoofs\nvigorously on the foremost wolf, while her hind ones were doing even\nmore effective work. The larger wolf soon went limping away with a\nbroken hip, and the one in the rear received a deep cut on the jaw which\nproved an effectual discouragement.\n\nA little further on, an Indian hunter drew near on horseback, but Nakpa\ndid not pause or slacken her pace. On she fled through the long dry\ngrass of the river bottoms, while her babies slept again from sheer\nexhaustion. Toward sunset, she entered the Sioux camp amid great\nexcitement, for some one had spied her afar off, and the boys and the\ndogs announced her coming.\n\n“Whoo, whoo! Weeko’s Nakpa has come back with the twins! Whoo, whoo!”\n exclaimed the men. “Tokee! tokee!” cried the women.\n\nA sister to Weeko who was in the village came forward and released the\nchildren, as Nakpa gave a low whinny and stopped. Tenderly Zeezeewin\nnursed them at her own motherly bosom, assisted by another young mother\nof the band.\n\n“Ugh, there is a Crow arrow sticking in the saddle! A fight! a fight!”\n exclaimed the warriors.\n\n“Sing a Brave-Heart song for the Long-Eared one! She has escaped alone\nwith her charge. She is entitled to wear an eagle’s feather! Look at the\narrow in her saddle! and more, she has a knife wound in her jaw and an\narrow cut on her hind leg.--No, those are the marks of a wolf’s teeth!\nShe has passed through many dangers and saved two chief’s sons, who will\nsome day make the Crows sorry for this day’s work!”\n\nThe speaker was an old man who thus addressed the fast gathering throng.\n\nZeezeewin now came forward again with an eagle feather and some white\npaint in her hands. The young men rubbed Nakpa down, and the feather,\nmarked with red to indicate her wounds, was fastened to her mane.\nShoulders and hips were touched with red paint to show her endurance in\nrunning. Then the crier, praising her brave deed in heroic verse, led\nher around the camp, inside of the circle of teepees. All the people\nstood outside their lodges and listened respectfully, for the Dakota\nloves well to honor the faithful and the brave.\n\nDuring the next day, riders came in from the ill-fated party, bringing\nthe sad news of the fight and heavy loss. Late in the afternoon came\nWeeko, her face swollen with crying, her beautiful hair cut short in\nmourning, her garments torn and covered with dust and blood. Her husband\nhad fallen in the fight, and her twin boys she supposed to have been\ntaken captive by the Crows. Singing in a hoarse voice the praises of her\ndeparted warrior, she entered the camp. As she approached her sister’s\nteepee, there stood Nakpa, still wearing her honorable decorations. At\nthe same moment, Zeezeewin came out to meet her with both babies in her\narms.\n\n“Mechinkshee! meechinkshee! (my sons, my sons!)” was all that the poor\nmother could say, as she all but fell from her saddle to the ground. The\ndespised Long Ears had not betrayed her trust.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. THE WAR MAIDEN\n\nThe old man, Smoky Day, was for many years the best-known story-teller\nand historian of his tribe. He it was who told me the story of the War\nMaiden. In the old days it was unusual but not unheard of for a woman to\ngo upon the war-path--perhaps a young girl, the last of her line, or a\nwidow whose well-loved husband had fallen on the field--and there could\nbe no greater incentive to feats of desperate daring on the part of the\nwarriors. “A long time ago,” said old Smoky Day, “the Unkpapa and the\nCut-Head bands of Sioux united their camps upon a vast prairie east of\nthe Minne Wakan (now called Devil’s Lake). It was midsummer, and the\npeople shared in the happiness of every living thing. We had food in\nabundance, for bison in countless numbers overspread the plain.\n\n“The teepee village was laid out in two great rings, and all was in\nreadiness for the midsummer entertainments. There were ball games,\nfeasts and dances every day, and late into the night. You have heard of\nthe festivities of those days; there are none like them now,” said the\nold man, and he sighed heavily as he laid down the red pipe which was to\nbe passed from hand to hand during the recital.\n\n“The head chief of the Unkpapas then was Tamakoche (His Country). He was\nin his time a notable warrior, a hunter and a feastmaker, much beloved\nby his people. He was the father of three sons, but he was so anxious\nto make them warriors of great reputation that they had all, despising\ndanger, been killed in battle.\n\n“The chief had also a very pretty daughter, whose name was Makatah.\nSince all his sons were slain he had placed his affections solely upon\nthe girl, and she grew up listening to the praises of the brave deeds\nof her brothers, which her father never tired of chanting when they were\ntogether in the lodge. At times Makatah was called upon to dance to the\n‘Strong-Heart’ songs. Thus even as a child she loved the thought of war,\nalthough she was the prettiest and most modest maiden in the two tribes.\nAs she grew into womanhood she became the belle of her father’s village,\nand her beauty and spirit were talked of even among the neighboring\nbands of Sioux. But it appeared that Makatah did not care to marry. She\nhad only two ambitions. One was to prove to her father that, though\nonly a maid, she had the heart of a warrior. The other was to visit the\ngraves of her brothers--that is, the country of the enemy.\n\n“At this pleasant reunion of two kindred peoples one of the principal\nevents was the Feast of Virgins, given by Makatah. All young maidens of\nvirtue and good repute were invited to be present; but woe to her who\nshould dare to pollute the sacred feast! If her right to be there were\nchallenged by any it meant a public disgrace. The two arrows and the red\nstone upon which the virgins took their oath of chastity were especially\nprepared for the occasion. Every girl was beautifully dressed, for\nat that time the white doeskin gowns, with a profusion of fringes and\ncolored embroidery, were the gala attire of the Sioux maidens. Red\npaint was added, and ornaments of furs and wampum. Many youths eagerly\nsurveyed the maiden gathering, at which the daughter of Tamakoche\noutshone all the rest.\n\n“Several eligible warriors now pressed their suits at the chieftain’s\nlodge, and among them were one or two whom he would have gladly called\nson-in-law; but no! Makatah would not listen to words of courtship. She\nhad vowed, she said, to the spirits of her three brothers--each of whom\nfell in the country of the Crows--that she would see that country before\nshe became a wife.\n\n“Red Horn, who was something of a leader among the young men, was a\npersistent and determined suitor. He had urged every influential friend\nof his and hers to persuade her to listen to him. His presents were more\nvaluable than those of any one else. He even made use of his father’s\nposition as a leading chief of the Cut-Head band to force a decision in\nhis favor; and while the maiden remained indifferent her father seemed\ninclined to countenance this young man’s pretensions.\n\n“She had many other lovers, as I have said,” the old man added, “and\namong them was one Little Eagle, an orphan and a poor young man, unknown\nand unproved as a warrior. He was so insignificant that nobody thought\nmuch about him, and if Makatah regarded him with any favor the matter\nwas her secret, for it is certain that she did not openly encourage him.\n\n“One day it was reported in the village that their neighbors, the\nCut-Head Sioux, would organize a great attack upon the Crows at the\nmouth of the Redwater, a tributary of the Missouri. Makatah immediately\ninquired of her male cousins whether any of them expected to join the\nwar-party.\n\n“‘Three of us will go,’ they replied.\n\n“‘Then,’ said the girl, ‘I beg that you will allow me to go with you!\nI have a good horse, and I shall not handicap you in battle. I only ask\nyour protection in camp as your kinswoman and a maid of the war-party.’\n\n“‘If our uncle Tamakoche sanctions your going,’ they replied, ‘we shall\nbe proud to have our cousin with us, to inspire us to brave deeds!’\n\n“The maiden now sought her father and asked his permission to accompany\nthe warparty.\n\n“‘I wish,’ said she, ‘to visit the graves of my brothers! I shall carry\nwith me their war-bonnets and their weapons, to give to certain young\nmen on the eve of battle, according to the ancient custom. Long ago I\nresolved to do this, and the time is now come.’\n\n“The chief was at this time well advanced in years, and had been sitting\nquite alone in his lodge, thinking upon the days of his youth, when he\nwas noted for daring and success in battle. In silence he listened as\nhe filled his pipe, and seemed to meditate while he smoked the fragrant\ntobacco. At last he spoke with tears in his eyes.\n\n“‘Daughter, I am an old man! My heart beats in my throat, and my old\neyes cannot keep back the tears. My three sons, on whom I had placed all\nmy hopes, are gone to a far country! You are the only child left to my\nold age, and you, too, are brave--as brave as any of your brothers. If\nyou go I fear that you may not return to me; yet I cannot refuse you my\npermission!”\n\n“The old man began to chant a war-song, and some of his people, hearing\nhim, came in to learn what was in his mind. He told them all, and\nimmediately many young men volunteered for the war-party, in order to\nhave the honor of going with the daughter of their chief.\n\n“Several of Makatah’s suitors were among them, and each watched eagerly\nfor an opportunity to ride at her side. At night she pitched her little\nteepee within the circle of her cousins’ campfires, and there she slept\nwithout fear. Courteous youths brought to her every morning and evening\nfresh venison for her repast. Yet there was no courting, for all\nattentions paid to a maiden when on the war-path must be those of a\nbrother to a sister, and all must be equally received by her.\n\n“Two days later, when the two parties of Sioux met on the plains, the\nmaiden’s presence was heralded throughout the camp, as an inspiration to\nthe young and untried warriors of both bands to distinguish themselves\nin the field. It is true that some of the older men considered it unwise\nto allow Makatah to accompany the war-party.\n\n“‘The girl,’ said they to one another, ‘is very ambitious as well as\nbrave. She will surely risk her own life in battle, which will make the\nyoung men desperate, and we shall lose many of them!’\n\n“Nevertheless they loved her and her father; therefore they did not\nprotest openly.\n\n“On the third day the Sioux scouts returned with the word that the Crows\nwere camping, as had been supposed, at the confluence of the Redwater\nand the Missouri Rivers. It was a great camp. All the Crow tribe were\nthere, they said, with their thousands of fine horses.\n\n“There was excitement in the Sioux camp, and all of the head men\nimmediately met in council. It was determined to make the attack early\non the following morning, just as the sun came over the hills. The\ncouncilors agreed that in honor of the great chief, her father, as well\nas in recognition of her own courage, Makatah should be permitted to\nlead the charge at the outset, but that she must drop behind as they\nneared the enemy. The maiden, who had one of the fleetest ponies in that\npart of the country, had no intention of falling back, but she did not\ntell any one what was in her mind.\n\n“That evening every warrior sang his warsong, and announced the\nparticular war-charm or ‘medicine’ of his clan, according to the custom.\nThe youths were vying with one another in brave tales of what they would\ndo on the morrow. The voice of Red Horn was loud among the boasters, for\nhe was known to be a vain youth, although truly not without reputation.\nLittle Eagle, who was also of the company, remained modestly silent, as\nindeed became one without experience in the field. In the midst of the\nclamor there fell a silence.\n\n“‘Hush! hush!’ they whispered. ‘Look, look! The War Maiden comes!’\n\n“All eyes were turned upon Makatah, who rode her fine buckskin steed\nwith a single lariat. He held his head proudly, and his saddle was heavy\nwith fringes and gay with colored embroidery. The maiden was attired in\nher best and wore her own father’s war-bonnet, while she carried in her\nhands two which had belonged to two of her dead brothers. Singing in a\nclear voice the songs of her clan, she completed the circle, according\nto custom, before she singled out one of the young braves for special\nhonor by giving him the bonnet which she held in her right hand. She\nthen crossed over to the Cut-Heads, and presented the other bonnet to\none of their young men. She was very handsome; even the old men’s blood\nwas stirred by her brave appearance!\n\n“At daybreak the two war-parties of the Sioux, mounted on their best\nhorses, stood side by side, ready for the word to charge. All of the\nwarriors were painted for the battle--prepared for death--their\nnearly nude bodies decorated with their individual war-totems. Their\nwell-filled quivers were fastened to their sides, and each tightly\ngrasped his oaken bow.\n\n“The young man with the finest voice had been chosen to give the\nsignal--a single highpitched yell. This was an imitation of the one\nlong howl of the gray wolf before he makes the attack. It was an ancient\ncustom of our people.\n\n“‘Woo-o-o-o!’--at last it came! As the sound ceased a shrill war-whoop\nfrom five hundred throats burst forth in chorus, and at the same instant\nMakatah, upon her splendid buckskin pony, shot far out upon the plain,\nlike an arrow as it leaves the bow. It was a glorious sight! No man has\never looked upon the like again!”\n\nThe eyes of the old man sparkled as he spoke, and his bent shoulders\nstraightened.\n\n“The white doeskin gown of the War Maiden,” he continued, “was trimmed\nwith elk’s teeth and tails of ermine. Her long black hair hung loose,\nbound only with a strip of otter-skin, and with her eagle-feather\nwar-bonnet floated far behind. In her hand she held a long coup-staff\ndecorated with eagle-feathers. Thus she went forth in advance of them\nall!\n\n“War cries of men and screams of terrified women and children were borne\nupon the clear morning air as our warriors neared the Crow camp. The\ncharge was made over a wide plain, and the Crows came yelling from\ntheir lodges, fully armed, to meet the attacking party. In spite of the\nsurprise they easily held their own, and even began to press us hard, as\ntheir number was much greater than that of the Sioux.\n\n“The fight was a long and hard one. Toward the end of the day the enemy\nmade a counter-charge. By that time many of our ponies had fallen or\nwere exhausted. The Sioux retreated, and the slaughter was great. The\nCut-Heads fled womanlike; but the people of Tamakoche fought gallantly\nto the very last.\n\n“Makatah remained with her father’s people. Many cried out to her,\n‘Go back! Go back!’ but she paid no attention. She carried no weapon\nthroughout the day--nothing but her coup-staff--but by her presence and\nher cries of encouragement or praise she urged on the men to deeds of\ndesperate valor.\n\n“Finally, however, the Sioux braves were hotly pursued and the retreat\nbecame general. Now at last Makatah tried to follow; but her pony was\ntired, and the maiden fell farther and farther behind. Many of her\nlovers passed her silently, intent upon saving their own lives. Only a\nfew still remained behind, fighting desperately to cover the retreat,\nwhen Red Horn came up with the girl. His pony was still fresh. He might\nhave put her up behind him and carried her to safety, but he did not\neven look at her as he galloped by.\n\n“Makatah did not call out, but she could not help looking after him. He\nhad declared his love for her more loudly than any of the others, and\nshe now gave herself up to die.\n\n“Presently another overtook the maiden. It was Little Eagle, unhurt and\nsmiling.\n\n“‘Take my horse!’ he said to her. ‘I shall remain here and fight!’\n\n“The maiden looked at him and shook her head, but he sprang off and\nlifted her upon his horse. He struck him a smart blow upon the flank\nthat sent him at full speed in the direction of the Sioux encampment.\nThen he seized the exhausted buckskin by the lariat, and turned back to\njoin the rear-guard.\n\n“That little group still withstood in some fashion the all but\nirresistible onset of the Crows. When their comrade came back to them,\nleading the War Maiden’s pony, they were inspired to fresh endeavor, and\nthough few in number they made a counter-charge with such fury that the\nCrows in their turn were forced to retreat!\n\n“The Sioux got fresh mounts and returned to the field, and by sunset the\nday was won! Little Eagle was among the first who rode straight through\nthe Crow camp, causing terror and consternation. It was afterward\nremembered that he looked unlike his former self and was scarcely\nrecognized by the warriors for the modest youth they had so little\nregarded.\n\n“It was this famous battle which drove that warlike nation, the Crows,\nto go away from the Missouri and to make their home up the Yellowstone\nRiver and in the Bighorn country. But many of our men fell, and among\nthem the brave Little Eagle!\n\n“The sun was almost over the hills when the Sioux gathered about their\ncampfires, recounting the honors won in battle, and naming the brave\ndead. Then came the singing of dirges and weeping for the slain! The\nsadness of loss was mingled with exultation.\n\n“Hush! listen! the singing and wailing have ceased suddenly at both\ncamps. There is one voice coming around the circle of campfires. It is\nthe voice of a woman! Stripped of all her ornaments, her dress shorn\nof its fringes, her ankles bare, her hair cropped close to her neck,\nleading a pony with mane and tail cut short, she is mourning as widows\nmourn. It is Makatah!\n\n“Publicly, with many tears, she declared herself the widow of the brave\nLittle Eagle, although she had never been his wife! He it was, she said\nwith truth, who had saved her people’s honor and her life at the cost of\nhis own. He was a true man!\n\n“‘Ho, ho!’ was the response from many of the older warriors; but the\nyoung men, the lovers of Makatah, were surprised and sat in silence.\n\n“The War Maiden lived to be a very old woman, but she remained true\nto her vow. She never accepted a husband; and all her lifetime she was\nknown as the widow of the brave Little Eagle.”\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nA-no-ka-san, white on both sides (Bald Eagle).\nA-tay, father.\nCha-ton’-ska, White Hawk.\nChin-o-te-dah, Lives-in-the-Wood.\nChin-to, yes, indeed.\nE-na-ka-nee, hurry.\nE-ya-tonk-a-wee, She-whose-Voice-is-heard-afar.\nE-yo-tank-a, rise up, or sit down.\nHa-ha-ton-wan, Ojibway.\nHa-na-ka-pe, a grave.\nHan-ta-wo, Out of the way!\nHe-che-tu, it is well.\nHe-yu-pe-ya, come here!\nHi! an exclamation of thanks.\nHunk-pa-tees, a band of Sioux.\nKa-po-sia, Light Lodges, a band of Sioux.\nKe-chu-wa, darling.\nKo-da, friend.\nMa-ga-ska-wee, Swan Maiden.\nMa-ka-tah, Earth Woman.\nMa-to, bear.\nMa-to-ska, White Bear.\nMa-to-sa-pa, Black Bear.\nMe-chink-she, my son or sons.\nMe-ta, my.\nMin-ne-wa-kan, Sacred Water (Devil’s Lake.)\nMin-ne-ya-ta, By-the-Water.\nNak-pa, Ears or Long Ears.\nNe-na e-ya-ya! run fast!\nO-glu-ge-chan-a, Mysterious Wood-Dweller.\nPsay, snow-shoes.\nShunk-a, dog.\nShunk-a-ska, White Dog.\nShunk-ik-chek-a, domestic dog.\nSke-ske-ta-tonk-a, Sault Sainte Marie.\nSna-na, Rattle.\nSta-su, Shield (Arickaree).\nTa-ake-che-ta, his soldier.\nTa-chin-cha-la, fawn.\nTak-cha, doe.\nTa-lu-ta, Scarlet.\nTa-ma-hay, Pike.\nTa-ma-ko-che, His Country.\nTa-na-ge-la, Humming-Bird.\nTa-tank-a-o-ta, Many Buffaloes.\nTa-te-yo-pa, Her Door.\nTa-to-ka, Antelope.\nTa-wa-su-o-ta, Many Hailstones.\nTee-pee, tent.\nTe-yo-tee-pee, Council lodge.\nTo-ke-ya nun-ka hu-wo? where are you?\nTunk-a-she-dah, grandfather.\nUn-chee-dah, grandmother.\nUnk-pa-pa, a band of Sioux.\nU-ya-yo! come here!\nWa-ba-shaw, Red Hat (name of a Sioux chief).\nWa-ha-dah, Buyer of Furs.\nWah-pay-ton, a band of Sioux.\nWa-ho, Howler.\nWa-kan, sacred, mysterious.\nWak-pay-ku-tay, a band of Sioux.\nWa-pay-na, Little Barker.\nWee-ko, Beautiful Woman.\nWe-no-na, Firstborn Daughter.\nWe-sha-wee, Red Girl.\nWe-wop-tay, a sharpened pole.\nWe-yan-na, little woman.\nWe-zee, Smoky Lodge.\nYank-ton-nais, a band of Sioux.\nZee-zee-win, Yellow Woman.\nZu-ya-ma-ni, Walks-to-War.",
