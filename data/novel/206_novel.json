I had myself often\nremarked the name, but never met the individual. On one occasion, when\nour house was filled with company, several eminent clergymen being our\nguests, notice was brought up to me that Sojourner Truth was below, and\nrequested an interview. Knowing nothing of her but her singular name, I\nwent down, prepared to make the interview short, as the pressure of many\nother engagements demanded.\n\nWhen I went into the room, a tall, spare form arose to meet me. She was\nevidently a full-blooded African, and though now aged and worn with many\nhardships, still gave the impression of a physical development which\nin early youth must have been as fine a specimen of the torrid zone as\nCumberworth's celebrated statuette of the Negro Woman at the Fountain.\nIndeed, she so strongly reminded me of that figure, that, when I recall\nthe events of her life, as she narrated them to me, I imagine her as a\nliving, breathing impersonation of that work of art.\n\nI do not recollect ever to have been conversant with any one who had\nmore of that silent and subtle power which we call personal presence\nthan this woman. In the modern Spiritualistic phraseology, she would\nbe described as having a strong sphere. Her tall form, as she rose up\nbefore me, is still vivid to my mind. She was dressed in some stout,\ngrayish stuff, neat and clean, though dusty from travel. On her head,\nshe wore a bright Madras handkerchief, arranged as a turban, after\nthe manner of her race. She seemed perfectly self-possessed and at her\nease,--in fact, there was almost an unconscious superiority, not unmixed\nwith a solemn twinkle of humor, in the odd, composed manner in which she\nlooked down on me. Her whole air had at times a gloomy sort of drollery\nwhich impressed one strangely.\n\n\"So this is YOU,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\n\n\"Well, honey, de Lord bless ye! I jes' thought I'd like to come an' have\na look at ye. You's heerd o' me, I reckon?\" she added.\n\n\"Yes, I think I have. You go about lecturing, do you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, honey, that's what I do. The Lord has made me a sign unto this\nnation, an' I go round a'testifyin', an' showin' on 'em their sins agin\nmy people.\"\n\nSo saying, she took a seat, and, stooping over and crossing her arms\non her knees, she looked down on the floor, and appeared to fall into a\nsort of reverie. Her great gloomy eyes and her dark face seemed to work\nwith some undercurrent of feeling; she sighed deeply, and occasionally\nbroke out,--\n\n\"O Lord! O Lord! Oh, the tears, an' the groans, an' the moans! O Lord!\"\n\nI should have said that she was accompanied by a little grandson of ten\nyears,--the fattest, jolliest woolly-headed little specimen of Africa\nthat one can imagine. He was grinning and showing his glistening white\nteeth in a state of perpetual merriment, and at this moment broke out\ninto an audible giggle, which disturbed the reverie into which his\nrelative was falling.\n\nShe looked at him with an indulgent sadness, and then at me.\n\n\"Laws, Ma'am, HE don't know nothin' about it--HE don't. Why, I've\nseen them poor critters, beat an' 'bused an' hunted, brought in all\ntorn,--ears hangin' all in rags, where the dogs been a'bitin' of 'em!\"\n\nThis set off our little African Puck into another giggle, in which he\nseemed perfectly convulsed.\n\nShe surveyed him soberly, without the slightest irritation.\n\n\"Well, you may bless the Lord you CAN laugh; but I tell you, 't wa'n't\nno laughin' matter.\"\n\nBy this time I thought her manner so original that it might be worth\nwhile to call down my friends; and she seemed perfectly well pleased\nwith the idea. An audience was what she wanted,--it mattered not whether\nhigh or low, learned or ignorant. She had things to say, and was ready\nto say them at all times, and to any one.\n\nI called down Dr. Beecher, Professor Allen, and two or three other\nclergymen, who, together with my husband and family, made a roomful. No\nprincess could have received a drawing-room with more composed dignity\nthan Sojourner her audience. She stood among them, calm and erect, as\none of her own native palm-trees waving alone in the desert. I presented\none after another to her, and at last said,--\n\n\"Sojourner, this is Dr. Beecher. He is a very celebrated preacher.\"\n\n\"IS he?\" she said, offering her hand in a condescending manner, and\nlooking down on his white head. \"Ye dear lamb, I'm glad to see ye! De\nLord bless ye! I loves preachers. I'm a kind o' preacher myself.\"\n\n\"You are?\" said Dr. Beecher. \"Do you preach from the Bible?\"\n\n\"No, honey, can't preach from de Bible,--can't read a letter.\"\n\n\"Why, Sojourner, what do you preach from, then?\"\n\nHer answer was given with a solemn power of voice, peculiar to herself,\nthat hushed every one in the room.\n\n\"When I preaches, I has jest one text to preach from, an' I always\npreaches from this one. MY text is, 'WHEN I FOUND JESUS.'\"\n\n\"Well, you couldn't have a better one,\" said one of the ministers.\n\nShe paid no attention to him, but stood and seemed swelling with her own\nthoughts, and then began this narration:--\n\n\"Well, now, I'll jest have to go back, an' tell ye all about it. Ye see,\nwe was all brought over from Africa, father an' mother an' I, an' a lot\nmore of us; an' we was sold up an' down, an' hither an' yon; an' I can\n'member, when I was a little thing, not bigger than this 'ere,\" pointing\nto her grandson, \"how my ole mammy would sit out o' doors in the\nevenin', an' look up at the stars an' groan. She'd groan an' groan, an'\nsays I to her,--\n\n\"'Mammy, what makes you groan so?'\n\n\"an' she'd say,--\n\n\"'Matter enough, chile! I'm groanin' to think o' my poor children: they\ndon't know where I be, an' I don't know where they be; they looks up at\nthe stars, an' I looks up at the stars, but I can't tell where they be.\n\n\"'Now,' she said, 'chile, when you're grown up, you may be sold away\nfrom your mother an' all your ole friends, an' have great troubles come\non ye; an' when you has these troubles come on ye, ye jes' go to God,\nan' He'll help ye.'\n\n\"An' says I to her,--\n\n\"'Who is God, anyhow, mammy?'\n\n\"An' says she,--\n\n\"'Why, chile, you jes' look up DAR! It's Him that made all DEM!\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't mind much 'bout God in them days. I grew up pretty\nlively an' strong, an' could row a boat, or ride a horse, or work round,\nan' do 'most anything.\n\n\"At last I got sold away to a real hard massa an' missis. Oh, I tell\nyou, they WAS hard! 'Peared like I couldn't please 'em, nohow. An' then\nI thought o' what my old mammy told me about God; an' I thought I'd got\ninto trouble, sure enough, an' I wanted to find God, an' I heerd some\none tell a story about a man that met God on a threshin'-floor, an' I\nthought, 'Well an' good, I'll have a threshin'-floor, too.' So I went\ndown in the lot, an' I threshed down a place real hard, an' I used to go\ndown there every day, an' pray an' cry with all my might, a-prayin' to\nthe Lord to make my massa an' missis better, but it didn't seem to do no\ngood; an' so says I, one day,--\n\n\"'O God, I been a-askin' ye, an' askin' ye, an' askin' ye, for all this\nlong time, to make my massa an' missis better, an' you don't do it, an'\nwhat CAN be the reason? Why, maybe you CAN'T. Well, I shouldn't wonder\nef you couldn't. Well, now, I tell you, I'll make a bargain with you.\nEf you'll help me to git away from my massa an' missis, I'll agree to\nbe good; but ef you don't help me, I really don't think I can be. Now,'\nsays I, 'I want to git away; but the trouble's jest here: ef I try to\ngit away in the night, I can't see; an' ef I try to git away in the\ndaytime, they'll see me, an' be after me.'\n\n\"Then the Lord said to me, 'Git up two or three hours afore daylight,\nan' start off.'\n\n\"An' says I, 'Thank 'ee, Lord! that's a good thought.'\n\n\"So up I got, about three o'clock in the mornin', an' I started an'\ntravelled pretty fast, till, when the sun rose, I was clear away from\nour place an' our folks, an' out o' sight. An' then I begun to think I\ndidn't know nothin' where to go. So I kneeled down, and says I,--\n\n\"'Well, Lord, you've started me out, an' now please to show me where to\ngo.'\n\n\"Then the Lord made a house appear to me, an' He said to me that I was\nto walk on till I saw that house, an' then go in an' ask the people to\ntake me. An' I travelled all day, an' didn't come to the house till\nlate at night; but when I saw it, sure enough, I went in, an' I told the\nfolks that the Lord sent me; an' they was Quakers, an' real kind they\nwas to me. They jes' took me in, an' did for me as kind as ef I'd been\none of 'em; an' after they'd giv me supper, they took me into a room\nwhere there was a great, tall, white bed; an' they told me to sleep\nthere. Well, honey, I was kind o' skeered when they left me alone with\nthat great white bed; 'cause I never had been in a bed in my life. It\nnever came into my mind they could mean me to sleep in it. An' so I jes'\ncamped down under it, on the floor, an' then I slep' pretty well. In the\nmornin', when they came in, they asked me ef I hadn't been asleep; an' I\nsaid, 'Yes, I never slep' better.' An' they said, 'Why, you haven't been\nin the bed!' An' says I, 'Laws, you didn't think o' such a thing as my\nsleepin' in dat 'ar' BED, did you? I never heerd o' such a thing in my\nlife.'\n\n\"Well, ye see, honey, I stayed an' lived with 'em. An' now jes' look\nhere: instead o' keepin' my promise an' bein' good, as I told the Lord\nI would, jest as soon as everything got a'goin' easy, I FORGOT ALL ABOUT\nGOD.\n\n\"Pretty well don't need no help; an' I gin up prayin.' I lived there two\nor three years, an' then the slaves in New York were all set free, an'\nole massa came to our home to make a visit, an' he asked me ef I didn't\nwant to go back an' see the folks on the ole place. An' I told him I\ndid. So he said, ef I'd jes' git into the wagon with him, he'd carry me\nover. Well, jest as I was goin' out to git into the wagon, I MET GOD!\nan' says I, 'O God, I didn't know as you was so great!' An' I turned\nright round an' come into the house, an' set down in my room; for 't was\nGod all around me. I could feel it burnin', burnin', burnin' all around\nme, an' goin' through me; an' I saw I was so wicked, it seemed as ef it\nwould burn me up. An' I said, 'O somebody, somebody, stand between God\nan' me! for it burns me!' Then, honey, when I said so, I felt as it\nwere somethin' like an amberill [umbrella] that came between me an' the\nlight, an' I felt it was SOMEBODY,--somebody that stood between me an'\nGod; an' it felt cool, like a shade; an' says I, 'Who's this that stands\nbetween me an' God? Is it old Cato?' He was a pious old preacher; but\nthen I seemed to see Cato in the light, an' he was all polluted an'\nvile, like me; an' I said, 'Is it old Sally?' an' then I saw her, an'\nshe seemed jes' so. An' then says I, 'WHO is this?' An' then, honey, for\na while it was like the sun shinin' in a pail o' water, when it moves up\nan' down; for I begun to feel 't was somebody that loved me; an' I tried\nto know him. An' I said, 'I know you! I know you! I know you!'--an' then\nI said, 'I don't know you! I don't know you! I don't know you!' An' when\nI said, 'I know you, I know you,' the light came; an' when I said, 'I\ndon't know you, I don't know you,' it went, jes' like the sun in a\npail o' water. An' finally somethin' spoke out in me an' said, 'THIS IS\nJESUS!' An' I spoke out with all my might, an' says I, 'THIS IS JESUS!\nGlory be to God!' An' then the whole world grew bright, an' the trees\nthey waved an' waved in glory, an' every little bit o' stone on the\nground shone like glass; an' I shouted an' said, 'Praise, praise, praise\nto the Lord!' An' I begun to feel such a love in my soul as I never felt\nbefore,--love to all creatures. An' then, all of a sudden, it stopped,\nan' I said, 'Dar's de white folks, that have abused you an' beat you an'\nabused your people,--think o' them!' But then there came another rush\nof love through my soul, an' I cried out loud,--'Lord, Lord, I can love\nEVEN DE WHITE FOLKS!'\n\n\"Honey, I jes' walked round an' round in a dream. Jesus loved me! I\nknowed it,--I felt it. Jesus was my Jesus. Jesus would love me always. I\ndidn't dare tell nobody; 't was a great secret. Everything had been got\naway from me that I ever had; an' I thought that ef I let white folks\nknow about this, maybe they'd get HIM away,--so I said, 'I'll keep this\nclose. I won't let any one know.'\"\n\n\"But, Sojourner, had you never been told about Jesus Christ?\"\n\n\"No, honey. I hadn't heerd no preachin',--been to no meetin'. Nobody\nhadn't told me. I'd kind o' heerd of Jesus, but thought he was like\nGineral Lafayette, or some o' them. But one night there was a Methodist\nmeetin' somewhere in our parts, an' I went; an' they got up an' begun\nfor to tell der 'speriences; an' de fust one begun to speak. I started,\n'cause he told about Jesus. 'Why,' says I to myself, 'dat man's found\nhim, too!' An' another got up an' spoke, an I said, 'He's found him,\ntoo!' An' finally I said, 'Why, they all know him!' I was so happy! An'\nthen they sung this hymn\": (Here Sojourner sang, in a strange, cracked\nvoice, but evidently with all her soul and might, mispronouncing the\nEnglish, but seeming to derive as much elevation and comfort from bad\nEnglish as from good):--\n\n\n     'There is a holy city,\n       A world of light above,\n      Above the stairs and regions,*\n       Built by the God of Love.\n\n     \"An Everlasting temple,\n       And saints arrayed in white\n      There serve their great Redeemer\n       And dwell with him in light.\n\n     \"The meanest child of glory\n       Outshines the radiant sun;\n      But who can speak the splendor\n       Of Jesus on his throne?\n\n     \"Is this the man of sorrows\n       Who stood at Pilate's bar,\n      Condemned by haughty Herod\n       And by his men of war?\n\n     \"He seems a mighty conqueror,\n       Who spoiled the powers below,\n      And ransomed many captives\n       From everlasting woe.\n\n     \"The hosts of saints around him\n       Proclaim his work of grace,\n      The patriarchs and prophets,\n       And all the godly race,\n\n     \"Who speak of fiery trials\n       And tortures on their way;\n      They came from tribulation\n       To everlasting day.\n\n     \"And what shall be my journey,\n       How long I'll stay below,\n      Or what shall be my trials,\n       Are not for me to know.\n\n     \"In every day of trouble\n       I'll raise my thoughts on high,\n      I'll think of that bright temple\n       And crowns above the sky.\"\n\n   * Starry regions.\n\n\nI put in this whole hymn, because Sojourner, carried away with her own\nfeeling, sang it from beginning to end with a triumphant energy that\nheld the whole circle around her intently listening. She sang with\nthe strong barbaric accent of the native African, and with those\nindescribable upward turns and those deep gutturals which give such a\nwild, peculiar power to the negro singing,--but above all, with such an\noverwhelming energy of personal appropriation that the hymn seemed to\nbe fused in the furnace of her feelings and come out recrystallized as a\nproduction of her own.\n\nIt is said that Rachel was wont to chant the \"Marseillaise\" in a manner\nthat made her seem, for the time, the very spirit and impersonation of\nthe gaunt, wild, hungry, avenging mob which rose against aristocratic\noppression; and in like manner, Sojourner, singing this hymn, seemed to\nimpersonate the fervor of Ethiopia, wild, savage, hunted of all nations,\nbut burning after God in her tropic heart, and stretching her scarred\nhands towards the glory to be revealed.\n\n\"Well, den ye see, after a while, I thought I'd go back an' see de folks\non de ole place. Well, you know, de law had passed dat de culled folks\nwas all free; an' my old missis, she had a daughter married about dis\ntime who went to live in Alabama,--an' what did she do but give her my\nson, a boy about de age of dis yer, for her to take down to Alabama?\nWhen I got back to de ole place, they told me about it, an' I went right\nup to see ole missis, an' says I,--\n\n\"'Missis, have you been an' sent my son away down to Alabama?'\n\n\"'Yes, I have,' says she; 'he's gone to live with your young missis.'\n\n\"'Oh, Missis,' says I, 'how could you do it?'\n\n\"'Poh!' says she, 'what a fuss you make about a little nigger! Got more\nof 'em now than you know what to do with.'\n\n\"I tell you, I stretched up. I felt as tall as the world!\n\n\"'Missis,' says I, 'I'LL HAVE MY SON BACK AGIN!'\n\n\"She laughed.\n\n\"'YOU will, you nigger? How you goin' to do it? You ha'n't got no\nmoney.\"\n\n\"'No, Missis,--but GOD has,--an' you'll see He'll help me!'--an' I\nturned round an' went out.\n\n\"Oh, but I WAS angry to have her speak to me so haughty an' so scornful,\nas ef my chile wasn't worth anything. I said to God, 'O Lord, render\nunto her double!' It was a dreadful prayer, an' I didn't know how true\nit would come.\n\n\"Well, I didn't rightly know which way to turn; but I went to the Lord,\nan' I said to Him, 'O Lord, ef I was as rich as you be, an' you was as\npoor as I be, I'd help you,--you KNOW I would; and, oh, do help me!' An'\nI felt sure then that He would.\n\n\"Well, I talked with people, an' they said I must git the case before\na grand jury. So I went into the town when they was holdin' a court, to\nsee ef I could find any grand jury. An' I stood round the\ncourt-house, an' when they was a-comin' out, I walked right up to the\ngrandest-lookin' one I could see, an' says I to him,--\n\n\"'Sir, be you a grand jury?'\n\n\"An' then he wanted to know why I asked, an' I told him all about it;\nan' he asked me all sorts of questions, an' finally he says to me,--\n\n\"'I think, ef you pay me ten dollars, that I'd agree to git your son for\nyou.' An' says he, pointin' to a house over the way, 'You go 'long an'\ntell your story to the folks in that house, an' I guess they'll give you\nthe money.'\n\n\"Well, I went, an' I told them, an' they gave me twenty dollars; an'\nthen I thought to myself, 'Ef ten dollars will git him, twenty dollars\nwill git him SARTIN.' So I carried it to the man all out, an' said,--\n\n\"'Take it all,--only be sure an' git him.'\n\n\"Well, finally they got the boy brought back; an' then they tried to\nfrighten him, an' to make him say that I wasn't his mammy, an' that he\ndidn't know me; but they couldn't make it out. They gave him to me,\nan' I took him an' carried him home; an' when I came to take off his\nclothes, there was his poor little back all covered with scars an' hard\nlumps, where they'd flogged him.\n\n\"Well, you see, honey, I told you how I prayed the Lord to render unto\nher double. Well, it came true; for I was up at ole missis' house not\nlong after, an' I heerd 'em readin' a letter to her how her daughter's\nhusband had murdered her,--how he'd thrown her down an' stamped the life\nout of her, when he was in liquor; an' my ole missis, she giv a screech,\nan' fell flat on the floor. Then says I, 'O Lord, I didn't mean all\nthat! You took me up too quick.'\n\n\"Well, I went in an' tended that poor critter all night. She was out of\nher mind,--a-cryin', an' callin' for her daughter; an' I held her poor\nole head on my arm, an' watched for her as ef she'd been my babby. An'\nI watched by her, an' took care on her all through her sickness after\nthat, an' she died in my arms, poor thing!\"\n\n\"Well, Sojourner, did you always go by this name?\"\n\n\"No, 'deed! My name was Isabella; but when I left the house of bondage,\nI left everything behind. I wa'n't goin' to keep nothin' of Egypt on me,\nan' so I went to the Lord an' asked Him to give me a new name. And the\nLord gave me Sojourner, because I was to travel up an' down the land,\nshowin' the people their sins, an' bein' a sign unto them. Afterwards\nI told the Lord I wanted another name, 'cause everybody else had two\nnames; and the Lord gave me Truth, because I was to declare the truth to\nthe people.\n\n\"Ye see some ladies have given me a white satin banner,\" she said,\npulling out of her pocket and unfolding a white banner, printed with\nmany texts, such as, \"Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all\nthe inhabitants thereof,\" and others of like nature. \"Well,\" she said,\n\"I journeys round to camp-meetins, an' wherever folks is, an' I sets up\nmy banner, an' then I sings, an' then folks always comes up round me,\nan' then I preaches to 'em. I tells 'em about Jesus, an' I tells 'em\nabout the sins of this people. A great many always comes to hear me; an'\nthey're right good to me, too, an' say they want to hear me agin.\"\n\nWe all thought it likely; and as the company left her, they shook hands\nwith her, and thanked her for her very original sermon; and one of the\nministers was overheard to say to another, \"There's more of the gospel\nin that story than in most sermons.\"\n\nSojourner stayed several days with us, a welcome guest. Her conversation\nwas so strong, simple, shrewd, and with such a droll flavoring of humor,\nthat the Professor was wont to say of an evening, \"Come, I am dull,\ncan't you get Sojourner up here to talk a little?\" She would come up\ninto the parlor, and sit among pictures and ornaments, in her simple\nstuff gown, with her heavy travelling-shoes, the central object of\nattention both to parents and children, always ready to talk or to sing,\nand putting into the common flow of conversation the keen edge of some\nshrewd remark.\n\n\"Sojourner, what do you think of Women's Rights?\"\n\n\"Well, honey, I's ben to der meetins, an' harked a good deal. Dey wanted\nme for to speak. So I got up. Says I,--'Sisters, I a'n't clear what\nyou'd be after. Ef women want any rights more 'n dey's got, why don't\ndey jes' TAKE 'EM, an' not be talkin' about it?' Some on 'em came round\nme, an' asked why I didn't wear Bloomers. An' I told 'em I had Bloomers\nenough when I was in bondage. You see,\" she said, \"dey used to weave\nwhat dey called nigger-cloth, an' each one of us got jes' sech a strip,\nan' had to wear it width-wise. Them that was short got along pretty\nwell, but as for me\"--She gave an indescribably droll glance at her long\nlimbs and then at us, and added,--\"Tell YOU, I had enough of Bloomers in\nthem days.\"\n\nSojourner then proceeded to give her views of the relative capacity of\nthe sexes, in her own way.\n\n\"S'pose a man's mind holds a quart, an' a woman's don't hold but a pint;\nef her pint is FULL, it's as good as his quart.\"\n\nSojourner was fond of singing an extraordinary lyric, commencing,--\n\n\n   \"I'm on my way to Canada,\n     That cold, but happy land;\n    The dire effects of Slavery\n     I can no longer stand.\n    O righteous Father,\n     Do look down on me,\n    And help me on to Canada,\n     Where colored folks are free!\"\n\n\nThe lyric ran on to state, that, when the fugitive crosses the Canada\nline,\n\n\n   \"The Queen comes down unto the shore,\n     With arms extended wide,\n    To welcome the poor fugitive\n     Safe onto Freedom's side.\"\n\n\nIn the truth thus set forth she seemed to have the most simple faith.\n\nBut her chief delight was to talk of \"glory,\" and to sing hymns whose\nburden was,--\n\n\n   \"O glory, glory, glory,\n     Won't you come along with me?\"\n\nand when left to herself, she would often hum these with great delight,\nnodding her head.\n\nOn one occasion, I remember her sitting at a window singing and\nfervently keeping time with her head, the little black Puck of a\ngrandson meanwhile amusing himself with ornamenting her red-and-yellow\nturban with green dandelion-curls, which shook and trembled with her\nemotions, causing him perfect convulsions of delight.\n\n\"Sojourner,\" said the Professor to her, one day, when he heard her\nsinging, \"you seem to be very sure about heaven.\"\n\n\"Well, I be,\" she answered, triumphantly.\n\n\"What makes you so sure there is any heaven?\"\n\n\"Well, 'cause I got such a hankerin' arter it in here,\" she\nsaid,--giving a thump on her breast with her usual energy.\n\nThere was at the time an invalid in the house, and Sojourner, on\nlearning it, felt a mission to go and comfort her. It was curious to see\nthe tall, gaunt, dusky figure stalk up to the bed with such an air of\nconscious authority, and take on herself the office of consoler\nwith such a mixture of authority and tenderness. She talked as from\nabove,--and at the same time, if a pillow needed changing or any office\nto be rendered, she did it with a strength and handiness that inspired\ntrust. One felt as if the dark, strange woman were quite able to take\nup the invalid in her bosom, and bear her as a lamb, both physically and\nspiritually. There was both power and sweetness in that great warm soul\nand that vigorous frame.\n\nAt length, Sojourner, true to her name, departed. She had her mission\nelsewhere. Where now she is I know not; but she left deep memories\nbehind her.\n\nTo these recollections of my own I will add one more anecdote, related\nby Wendell Phillips.\n\nSpeaking of the power of Rachel to move and bear down a whole audience\nby a few simple words, he said he never knew but one other human being\nthat had that power, and that other was Sojourner Truth. He related a\nscene of which he was witness. It was at a crowded public meeting in\nFaneuil Hall, where Frederick Douglas was one of the chief speakers.\nDouglas had been describing the wrongs of the black race, and as he\nproceeded, he grew more and more excited, and finally ended by saying\nthat they had no hope of justice from the whites, no possible hope\nexcept in their own right arms. It must come to blood; they must fight\nfor themselves, and redeem themselves, or it would never be done.\n\nSojourner was sitting, tall and dark, on the very front seat, facing the\nplatform; and in the hush of deep feeling, after Douglas sat down, she\nspoke out in her deep, peculiar voice, heard all over the house,--\n\n\"Frederick, IS GOD DEAD?\"\n\nThe effect was perfectly electrical, and thrilled through the whole\nhouse, changing as by a flash the whole feeling of the audience. Not\nanother word she said or needed to say; it was enough.\n\nIt is with a sad feeling that one contemplates noble minds and bodies,\nnobly and grandly formed human beings, that have come to us cramped,\nscarred, maimed, out of the prison-house of bondage. One longs to know\nwhat such beings might have become, if suffered to unfold and expand\nunder the kindly developing influences of education.\n\nIt is the theory of some writers, that to the African is reserved,\nin the later and palmier days of the earth, the full and harmonious\ndevelopment of the religious element in man. The African seems to seize\non the tropical fervor and luxuriance of Scripture imagery as something\nnative; he appears to feel himself to be of the same blood with those\nold burning, simple souls, the patriarchs, prophets, and seers, whose\nimpassioned words seem only grafted as foreign plants on the cooler\nstock of the Occidental mind.\n\nI cannot but think that Sojourner with the same culture might have\nspoken words as eloquent and undying as those of the African Saint\nAugustine or Tertullian. How grand and queenly a woman she might have\nbeen, with her wonderful physical vigor, her great heaving sea of\nemotion, her power of spiritual conception, her quick penetration, and\nher boundless energy! We might conceive an African type of woman so\nlargely made and moulded, so much fuller in all the elements of life,\nphysical and spiritual, that the dark hue of the skin should seem only\nto add an appropriate charm,--as Milton says of his Penseroso, whom he\nimagines\n\n\n        \"Black, but such as in esteem\n     Prince Memnon's sister might beseem,\n     Or that starred Ethiop queen that strove\n     To set her beauty's praise above\n     The sea-nymph's.\"\n\n\nBut though Sojourner Truth has passed away from among us as a wave of\nthe sea, her memory still lives in one of the loftiest and most original\nworks of modern art, the Libyan Sibyl, by Mr. Story, which attracted\nso much attention in the late World's Exhibition. Some years ago, when\nvisiting Rome, I related Sojourner's history to Mr. Story at a breakfast\nat his house. Already had his mind begun to turn to Egypt in search of\na type of art which should represent a larger and more vigorous\ndevelopment of nature than the cold elegance of Greek lines. His\nglorious Cleopatra was then in process of evolution, and his mind was\nworking out the problem of her broadly developed nature, of all that\nslumbering weight and fulness of passion with which this statue seems\ncharged, as a heavy thunder-cloud is charged with electricity.\n\nThe history of Sojourner Truth worked in his mind and led him into the\ndeeper recesses of the African nature,--those unexplored depths of being\nand feeling, mighty and dark as the gigantic depths of tropical forests,\nmysterious as the hidden rivers and mines of that burning continent\nwhose life-history is yet to be. A few days after, he told me that\nhe had conceived the idea of a statue which he should call the Libyan\nSibyl. Two years subsequently, I revisited Rome, and found the gorgeous\nCleopatra finished, a thing to marvel at, as the creation of a new\nstyle of beauty, a new manner of art. Mr. Story requested me to come and\nrepeat to him the history of Sojourner Truth, saying that the conception\nhad never left him. I did so; and a day or two after, he showed me the\nclay model of the Libyan Sibyl. I have never seen the marble statue; but\nam told by those who have, that it was by far the most impressive work\nof art at the Exhibition.\n\nA notice of the two statues from the London \"Athenaeum\" must supply a\ndescription which I cannot give.\n\n\n\"The Cleopatra and the Sibyl are seated, partly draped, with the\ncharacteristic Egyptian gown, that gathers about the torso and falls\nfreely around the limbs; the first is covered to the bosom, the second\nbare to the hips. Queenly Cleopatra rests back against her chair in\nmeditative ease, leaning her cheek against one hand, whose elbow the\nrail of the seat sustains; the other is outstretched upon her knee,\nnipping its forefinger upon the thumb thoughtfully, as though some firm,\nwilful purpose filled her brain, as it seems to set those luxurious\nfeatures to a smile as if the whole woman 'would.' Upon her head is\nthe coif, bearing in front the mystic uraeus, or twining basilisk of\nsovereignty, while from its sides depend the wide Egyptian lappels, or\nwings, that fall upon her shoulders. The Sibilla Libica has crossed her\nknees,--an action universally held amongst the ancients as indicative\nof reticence or secrecy, and of power to bind. A secret-keeping looking\ndame she is, in the full-bloom proportions of ripe womanhood, wherein\nchoosing to place his figure the sculptor has deftly gone between the\ndisputed point whether these women were blooming and wise in youth, or\ndeeply furrowed with age and burdened with the knowledge of centuries,\nas Virgil, Livy, and Gellius say. Good artistic example might be quoted\non both sides. Her forward elbow is propped upon one knee; and to keep\nher secrets close, for this Libyan woman is the closest of all the\nSibyls, she rests her shut mouth upon one closed palm, as if holding\nthe African mystery deep in the brooding brain that looks out through\nmournful, warning eyes, seen under the wide shade of the strange horned\n(ammonite) crest, that bears the mystery of the Tetragrammaton upon its\nupturned front. Over her full bosom, mother of myriads as she was, hangs\nthe same symbol. Her face has a Nubian cast, her hair wavy and plaited,\nas is meet.\"\n\n\nWe hope to see the day when copies both of the Cleopatra and the Libyan\nSibyl shall adorn the Capitol at Washington.\n\n\n\n\nRECONSTRUCTION by Frederick Douglass\n\n\nThe assembling of the Second Session of the Thirty-ninth Congress may\nvery properly be made the occasion of a few earnest words on the already\nmuch-worn topic of reconstruction.\n\nSeldom has any legislative body been the subject of a solicitude more\nintense, or of aspirations more sincere and ardent. There are the best\nof reasons for this profound interest. Questions of vast moment, left\nundecided by the last session of Congress, must be manfully grappled\nwith by this. No political skirmishing will avail. The occasion demands\nstatesmanship.\n\nWhether the tremendous war so heroically fought and so victoriously\nended shall pass into history a miserable failure, barren of permanent\nresults,--a scandalous and shocking waste of blood and treasure,--a\nstrife for empire, as Earl Russell characterized it, of no value to\nliberty or civilization,--an attempt to re-establish a Union by force,\nwhich must be the merest mockery of a Union,--an effort to bring under\nFederal authority States into which no loyal man from the North may\nsafely enter, and to bring men into the national councils who deliberate\nwith daggers and vote with revolvers, and who do not even conceal their\ndeadly hate of the country that conquered them; or whether, on the other\nhand, we shall, as the rightful reward of victory over treason, have\na solid nation, entirely delivered from all contradictions and social\nantagonisms, based upon loyalty, liberty, and equality, must be\ndetermined one way or the other by the present session of Congress.\nThe last session really did nothing which can be considered final as to\nthese questions. The Civil Rights Bill and the Freedmen's Bureau Bill\nand the proposed constitutional amendments, with the amendment already\nadopted and recognized as the law of the land, do not reach the\ndifficulty, and cannot, unless the whole structure of the government is\nchanged from a government by States to something like a despotic central\ngovernment, with power to control even the municipal regulations of\nStates, and to make them conform to its own despotic will. While there\nremains such an idea as the right of each State to control its own local\naffairs,--an idea, by the way, more deeply rooted in the minds of men\nof all sections of the country than perhaps any one other political\nidea,--no general assertion of human rights can be of any practical\nvalue. To change the character of the government at this point is\nneither possible nor desirable. All that is necessary to be done is to\nmake the government consistent with itself, and render the rights of the\nStates compatible with the sacred rights of human nature.\n\nThe arm of the Federal government is long, but it is far too short to\nprotect the rights of individuals in the interior of distant States.\nThey must have the power to protect themselves, or they will go\nunprotected, spite of all the laws the Federal government can put upon\nthe national statute-book.\n\nSlavery, like all other great systems of wrong, founded in the depths\nof human selfishness, and existing for ages, has not neglected its own\nconservation. It has steadily exerted an influence upon all around it\nfavorable to its own continuance. And to-day it is so strong that\nit could exist, not only without law, but even against law. Custom,\nmanners, morals, religion, are all on its side everywhere in the South;\nand when you add the ignorance and servility of the ex-slave to the\nintelligence and accustomed authority of the master, you have the\nconditions, not out of which slavery will again grow, but under which\nit is impossible for the Federal government to wholly destroy it, unless\nthe Federal government be armed with despotic power, to blot out State\nauthority, and to station a Federal officer at every cross-road. This,\nof course, cannot be done, and ought not even if it could. The true way\nand the easiest way is to make our government entirely consistent with\nitself, and give to every loyal citizen the elective franchise,--a right\nand power which will be ever present, and will form a wall of fire for\nhis protection.\n\nOne of the invaluable compensations of the late Rebellion is the\nhighly instructive disclosure it made of the true source of danger to\nrepublican government. Whatever may be tolerated in monarchical and\ndespotic governments, no republic is safe that tolerates a privileged\nclass, or denies to any of its citizens equal rights and equal means to\nmaintain them. What was theory before the war has been made fact by the\nwar.\n\nThere is cause to be thankful even for rebellion. It is an impressive\nteacher, though a stern and terrible one. In both characters it has come\nto us, and it was perhaps needed in both. It is an instructor never a\nday before its time, for it comes only when all other means of progress\nand enlightenment have failed. Whether the oppressed and despairing\nbondman, no longer able to repress his deep yearnings for manhood,\nor the tyrant, in his pride and impatience, takes the initiative, and\nstrikes the blow for a firmer hold and a longer lease of oppression, the\nresult is the same,--society is instructed, or may be.\n\nSuch are the limitations of the common mind, and so thoroughly\nengrossing are the cares of common life, that only the few among men can\ndiscern through the glitter and dazzle of present prosperity the dark\noutlines of approaching disasters, even though they may have come up to\nour very gates, and are already within striking distance. The yawning\nseam and corroded bolt conceal their defects from the mariner until\nthe storm calls all hands to the pumps. Prophets, indeed, were abundant\nbefore the war; but who cares for prophets while their predictions\nremain unfulfilled, and the calamities of which they tell are masked\nbehind a blinding blaze of national prosperity?\n\nIt is asked, said Henry Clay, on a memorable occasion, Will slavery\nnever come to an end? That question, said he, was asked fifty years ago,\nand it has been answered by fifty years of unprecedented prosperity.\nSpite of the eloquence of the earnest Abolitionists,--poured out against\nslavery during thirty years,--even they must confess, that, in all the\nprobabilities of the case, that system of barbarism would have continued\nits horrors far beyond the limits of the nineteenth century but for\nthe Rebellion, and perhaps only have disappeared at last in a fiery\nconflict, even more fierce and bloody than that which has now been\nsuppressed.\n\nIt is no disparagement to truth, that it can only prevail where reason\nprevails. War begins where reason ends. The thing worse than rebellion\nis the thing that causes rebellion. What that thing is, we have been\ntaught to our cost. It remains now to be seen whether we have the needed\ncourage to have that cause entirely removed from the Republic. At\nany rate, to this grand work of national regeneration and entire\npurification Congress must now address Itself, with full purpose that\nthe work shall this time be thoroughly done. The deadly upas, root and\nbranch, leaf and fibre, body and sap, must be utterly destroyed. The\ncountry is evidently not in a condition to listen patiently to pleas for\npostponement, however plausible, nor will it permit the responsibility\nto be shifted to other shoulders. Authority and power are here\ncommensurate with the duty imposed. There are no cloud-flung shadows to\nobscure the way. Truth shines with brighter light and intenser heat at\nevery moment, and a country torn and rent and bleeding implores relief\nfrom its distress and agony.\n\nIf time was at first needed, Congress has now had time. All the\nrequisite materials from which to form an intelligent judgment are now\nbefore it. Whether its members look at the origin, the progress, the\ntermination of the war, or at the mockery of a peace now existing, they\nwill find only one unbroken chain of argument in favor of a radical\npolicy of reconstruction. For the omissions of the last session, some\nexcuses may be allowed. A treacherous President stood in the way; and it\ncan be easily seen how reluctant good men might be to admit an apostasy\nwhich involved so much of baseness and ingratitude. It was natural that\nthey should seek to save him by bending to him even when he leaned to\nthe side of error. But all is changed now. Congress knows now that\nit must go on without his aid, and even against his machinations. The\nadvantage of the present session over the last is immense. Where that\ninvestigated, this has the facts. Where that walked by faith, this may\nwalk by sight. Where that halted, this must go forward, and where that\nfailed, this must succeed, giving the country whole measures where that\ngave us half-measures, merely as a means of saving the elections in a\nfew doubtful districts. That Congress saw what was right, but distrusted\nthe enlightenment of the loyal masses; but what was forborne in distrust\nof the people must now be done with a full knowledge that the people\nexpect and require it. The members go to Washington fresh from the\ninspiring presence of the people. In every considerable public\nmeeting, and in almost every conceivable way, whether at court-house,\nschool-house, or cross-roads, in doors and out, the subject has been\ndiscussed, and the people have emphatically pronounced in favor of a\nradical policy. Listening to the doctrines of expediency and compromise\nwith pity, impatience, and disgust, they have everywhere broken into\ndemonstrations of the wildest enthusiasm when a brave word has been\nspoken in favor of equal rights and impartial suffrage. Radicalism, so\nfar from being odious, is not the popular passport to power. The\nmen most bitterly charged with it go to Congress with the largest\nmajorities, while the timid and doubtful are sent by lean majorities, or\nelse left at home. The strange controversy between the President and the\nCongress, at one time so threatening, is disposed of by the people. The\nhigh reconstructive powers which he so confidently, ostentatiously,\nand haughtily claimed, have been disallowed, denounced, and utterly\nrepudiated; while those claimed by Congress have been confirmed.\n\nOf the spirit and magnitude of the canvass nothing need be said. The\nappeal was to the people, and the verdict was worthy of the tribunal.\nUpon an occasion of his own selection, with the advice and approval\nof his astute Secretary, soon after the members of the Congress had\nreturned to their constituents, the President quitted the executive\nmansion, sandwiched himself between two recognized heroes,--men whom\nthe whole country delighted to honor,--and, with all the advantage which\nsuch company could give him, stumped the country from the Atlantic to\nthe Mississippi, advocating everywhere his policy as against that of\nCongress. It was a strange sight, and perhaps the most disgraceful\nexhibition ever made by any President; but, as no evil is entirely\nunmixed, good has come of this, as from many others. Ambitious,\nunscrupulous, energetic, indefatigable, voluble, and plausible,--a\npolitical gladiator, ready for a \"set-to\" in any crowd,--he is beaten\nin his own chosen field, and stands to-day before the country as a\nconvicted usurper, a political criminal, guilty of a bold and persistent\nattempt to possess himself of the legislative powers solemnly secured to\nCongress by the Constitution. No vindication could be more complete, no\ncondemnation could be more absolute and humiliating. Unless reopened by\nthe sword, as recklessly threatened in some circles, this question is\nnow closed for all time.\n\nWithout attempting to settle here the metaphysical and somewhat\ntheological question (about which so much has already been said\nand written), whether once in the Union means always in the\nUnion,--agreeably to the formula, Once in grace always in grace,--it\nis obvious to common sense that the rebellious States stand to-day,\nin point of law, precisely where they stood when, exhausted, beaten,\nconquered, they fell powerless at the feet of Federal authority. Their\nState governments were overthrown, and the lives and property of\nthe leaders of the Rebellion were forfeited. In reconstructing the\ninstitutions of these shattered and overthrown States, Congress should\nbegin with a clean slate, and make clean work of it. Let there be\nno hesitation. It would be a cowardly deference to a defeated and\ntreacherous President, if any account were made of the illegitimate,\none-sided, sham governments hurried into existence for a malign purpose\nin the absence of Congress. These pretended governments, which were\nnever submitted to the people, and from participation in which four\nmillions of the loyal people were excluded by Presidential order,\nshould now be treated according to their true character, as shams and\nimpositions, and supplanted by true and legitimate governments, in the\nformation of which loyal men, black and white, shall participate.\n\nIt is not, however, within the scope of this paper to point out the\nprecise steps to be taken, and the means to be employed. The people\nare less concerned about these than the grand end to be attained.\nThey demand such a reconstruction as shall put an end to the present\nanarchical state of things in the late rebellious States,--where\nfrightful murders and wholesale massacres are perpetrated in the very\npresence of Federal soldiers. This horrible business they require shall\ncease. They want a reconstruction such as will protect loyal men, black\nand white, in their persons and property; such a one as will cause\nNorthern industry, Northern capital, and Northern civilization to flow\ninto the South, and make a man from New England as much at home in\nCarolina as elsewhere in the Republic. No Chinese wall can now be\ntolerated. The South must be opened to the light of law and liberty,\nand this session of Congress is relied upon to accomplish this important\nwork.\n\nThe plain, common-sense way of doing this work, as intimated at the\nbeginning, is simply to establish in the South one law, one government,\none administration of justice, one condition to the exercise of the\nelective franchise, for men of all races and colors alike. This great\nmeasure is sought as earnestly by loyal white men as by loyal blacks,\nand is needed alike by both. Let sound political prescience but take the\nplace of an unreasoning prejudice, and this will be done.\n\nMen denounce the negro for his prominence in this discussion; but it is\nno fault of his that in peace as in war, that in conquering Rebel armies\nas in reconstructing the rebellious States, the right of the negro is\nthe true solution of our national troubles. The stern logic of events,\nwhich goes directly to the point, disdaining all concern for the color\nor features of men, has determined the interests of the country as\nidentical with and inseparable from those of the negro.\n\nThe policy that emancipated and armed the negro--now seen to have been\nwise and proper by the dullest--was not certainly more sternly demanded\nthan is now the policy of enfranchisement. If with the negro was success\nin war, and without him failure, so in peace it will be found that the\nnation must fall or flourish with the negro.\n\nFortunately, the Constitution of the United States knows no distinction\nbetween citizens on account of color. Neither does it know any\ndifference between a citizen of a State and a citizen of the United\nStates. Citizenship evidently includes all the rights of citizens,\nwhether State or national. If the Constitution knows none, it is clearly\nno part of the duty of a Republican Congress now to institute one. The\nmistake of the last session was the attempt to do this very thing, by\na renunciation of its power to secure political rights to any class of\ncitizens, with the obvious purpose to allow the rebellious States to\ndisfranchise, if they should see fit, their colored citizens. This\nunfortunate blunder must now be retrieved, and the emasculated\ncitizenship given to the negro supplanted by that contemplated in the\nConstitution of the United States, which declares that the citizens of\neach State shall enjoy all the rights and immunities of citizens of the\nseveral States,--so that a legal voter in any State shall be a legal\nvoter in all the States.\n\n\n\n\nAN APPEAL TO CONGRESS FOR IMPARTIAL SUFFRAGE by Frederick Douglas\n\n\nA very limited statement of the argument for impartial suffrage, and for\nincluding the negro in the body politic, would require more space than\ncan be reasonably asked here. It is supported by reasons as broad as the\nnature of man, and as numerous as the wants of society. Man is the only\ngovernment-making animal in the world. His right to a participation\nin the production and operation of government is an inference from his\nnature, as direct and self-evident as is his right to acquire property\nor education. It is no less a crime against the manhood of a man, to\ndeclare that he shall not share in the making and directing of the\ngovernment under which he lives, than to say that he shall not acquire\nproperty and education. The fundamental and unanswerable argument in\nfavor of the enfranchisement of the negro is found in the undisputed\nfact of his manhood. He is a man, and by every fact and argument by\nwhich any man can sustain his right to vote, the negro can sustain his\nright equally. It is plain that, if the right belongs to any, it belongs\nto all. The doctrine that some men have no rights that others are bound\nto respect, is a doctrine which we must banish as we have banished\nslavery, from which it emanated. If black men have no rights in the\neyes of white men, of course the whites can have none in the eyes of the\nblacks. The result is a war of races, and the annihilation of all proper\nhuman relations.\n\nBut suffrage for the negro, while easily sustained upon abstract\nprinciples, demands consideration upon what are recognized as the urgent\nnecessities of the case. It is a measure of relief,--a shield to break\nthe force of a blow already descending with violence, and render it\nharmless. The work of destruction has already been set in motion all\nover the South. Peace to the country has literally meant war to the\nloyal men of the South, white and black; and negro suffrage is the\nmeasure to arrest and put an end to that dreadful strife.\n\nSomething then, not by way of argument, (for that has been done by\nCharles Sumner, Thaddeus Stevens, Wendell Phillips, Gerrit Smith, and\nother able men,) but rather of statement and appeal.\n\nFor better or for worse, (as in some of the old marriage ceremonies,)\nthe negroes are evidently a permanent part of the American population.\nThey are too numerous and useful to be colonized, and too enduring and\nself-perpetuating to disappear by natural causes. Here they are, four\nmillions of them, and, for weal or for woe, here they must remain. Their\nhistory is parallel to that of the country; but while the history of\nthe latter has been cheerful and bright with blessings, theirs has\nbeen heavy and dark with agonies and curses. What O'Connell said of the\nhistory of Ireland may with greater truth be said of the negro's. It may\nbe \"traced like a wounded man through a crowd, by the blood.\" Yet the\nnegroes have marvellously survived all the exterminating forces of\nslavery, and have emerged at the end of two hundred and fifty years\nof bondage, not morose, misanthropic, and revengeful, but cheerful,\nhopeful, and forgiving. They now stand before Congress and the country,\nnot complaining of the past, but simply asking for a better future.\nThe spectacle of these dusky millions thus imploring, not demanding, is\ntouching; and if American statesmen could be moved by a simple appeal to\nthe nobler elements of human nature, if they had not fallen, seemingly,\ninto the incurable habit of weighing and measuring every proposition of\nreform by some standard of profit and loss, doing wrong from choice, and\nright only from necessity or some urgent demand of human selfishness, it\nwould be enough to plead for the negroes on the score of past services\nand sufferings. But no such appeal shall be relied on here. Hardships,\nservices, sufferings, and sacrifices are all waived. It is true that\nthey came to the relief of the country at the hour of its extremest\nneed. It is true that, in many of the rebellious States, they were\nalmost the only reliable friends the nation had throughout the\nwhole tremendous war. It is true that, notwithstanding their alleged\nignorance, they were wiser than their masters, and knew enough to be\nloyal, while those masters only knew enough to be rebels and traitors.\nIt is true that they fought side by side in the loyal cause with\nour gallant and patriotic white soldiers, and that, but for their\nhelp,--divided as the loyal States were,--the Rebels might have\nsucceeded in breaking up the Union, thereby entailing border wars and\ntroubles of unknown duration and incalculable calamity. All this and\nmore is true of these loyal negroes. Many daring exploits will be told\nto their credit. Impartial history will paint them as men who deserved\nwell of their country. It will tell how they forded and swam rivers,\nwith what consummate address they evaded the sharp-eyed Rebel pickets,\nhow they toiled in the darkness of night through the tangled marshes\nof briers and thorns, barefooted and weary, running the risk of losing\ntheir lives, to warn our generals of Rebel schemes to surprise and\ndestroy our loyal army. It will tell how these poor people, whose rights\nwe still despised, behaved to our wounded soldiers, when found cold,\nhungry, and bleeding on the deserted battle-field; how they assisted our\nescaping prisoners from Andersonville, Belle Isle, Castle Thunder,\nand elsewhere, sharing with them their wretched crusts, and otherwise\naffording them aid and comfort; how they promptly responded to the\ntrumpet call for their services, fighting against a foe that denied them\nthe rights of civilized warfare, and for a government which was without\nthe courage to assert those rights and avenge their violation in\ntheir behalf; with what gallantry they flung themselves upon Rebel\nfortifications, meeting death as fearlessly as any other troops in the\nservice. But upon none of these things is reliance placed. These facts\nspeak to the better dispositions of the human heart; but they seem of\nlittle weight with the opponents of impartial suffrage.\n\nIt is true that a strong plea for equal suffrage might be addressed to\nthe national sense of honor. Something, too, might be said of national\ngratitude. A nation might well hesitate before the temptation to betray\nits allies. There is something immeasurably mean, to say nothing of the\ncruelty, in placing the loyal negroes of the South under the political\npower of their Rebel masters. To make peace with our enemies is all well\nenough; but to prefer our enemies and sacrifice our friends,--to exalt\nour enemies and cast down our friends,--to clothe our enemies, who\nsought the destruction of the government, with all political power, and\nleave our friends powerless in their hands,--is an act which need not be\ncharacterized here. We asked the negroes to espouse our cause, to be our\nfriends, to fight for us, and against their masters; and now, after\nthey have done all that we asked them to do,--helped us to conquer their\nmasters, and thereby directed toward themselves the furious hate of the\nvanquished,--it is proposed in some quarters to turn them over to the\npolitical control of the common enemy of the government and of the\nnegro. But of this let nothing be said in this place. Waiving humanity,\nnational honor, the claims of gratitude, the precious satisfaction\narising from deeds of charity and justice to the weak and\ndefenceless,--the appeal for impartial suffrage addresses itself with\ngreat pertinency to the darkest, coldest, and flintiest side of\nthe human heart, and would wring righteousness from the unfeeling\ncalculations of human selfishness.\n\nFor in respect to this grand measure it is the good fortune of the negro\nthat enlightened selfishness, not less than justice, fights on his side.\nNational interest and national duty, if elsewhere separated, are firmly\nunited here. The American people can, perhaps, afford to brave the\ncensure of surrounding nations for the manifest injustice and meanness\nof excluding its faithful black soldiers from the ballot-box, but\nit cannot afford to allow the moral and mental energies of rapidly\nincreasing millions to be consigned to hopeless degradation.\n\nStrong as we are, we need the energy that slumbers in the black man's\narm to make us stronger. We want no longer any heavy-footed, melancholy\nservice from the negro. We want the cheerful activity of the quickened\nmanhood of these sable millions. Nor can we afford to endure the\nmoral blight which the existence of a degraded and hated class must\nnecessarily inflict upon any people among whom such a class may exist.\nExclude the negroes as a class from political rights,--teach them that\nthe high and manly privilege of suffrage is to be enjoyed by white\ncitizens only,--that they may bear the burdens of the state, but that\nthey are to have no part in its direction or its honors,--and you at\nonce deprive them of one of the main incentives to manly character and\npatriotic devotion to the interests of the government; in a word, you\nstamp them as a degraded caste,--you teach them to despise themselves,\nand all others to despise them. Men are so constituted that they largely\nderive their ideas of their abilities and their possibilities from the\nsettled judgments of their fellow-men, and especially from such as they\nread in the institutions under which they live. If these bless them,\nthey are blest indeed; but if these blast them, they are blasted indeed.\nGive the negro the elective franchise, and you give him at once a\npowerful motive for all noble exertion, and make him a man among men.\nA character is demanded of him, and here as elsewhere demand favors\nsupply. It is nothing against this reasoning that all men who vote are\nnot good men or good citizens. It is enough that the possession and\nexercise of the elective franchise is in itself an appeal to the nobler\nelements of manhood, and imposes education as essential to the safety of\nsociety.\n\nTo appreciate the full force of this argument, it must be observed, that\ndisfranchisement in a republican government based upon the idea of\nhuman equality and universal suffrage, is a very different thing from\ndisfranchisement in governments based upon the idea of the divine right\nof kings, or the entire subjugation of the masses. Masses of men can\ntake care of themselves. Besides, the disabilities imposed upon all are\nnecessarily without that bitter and stinging element of invidiousness\nwhich attaches to disfranchisement in a republic. What is common to\nall works no special sense of degradation to any. But in a country\nlike ours, where men of all nations, kindred, and tongues are freely\nenfranchised, and allowed to vote, to say to the negro, You shall not\nvote, is to deal his manhood a staggering blow, and to burn into his\nsoul a bitter and goading sense of wrong, or else work in him a stupid\nindifference to all the elements of a manly character. As a nation, we\ncannot afford to have amongst us either this indifference and stupidity,\nor that burning sense of wrong. These sable millions are too powerful\nto be allowed to remain either indifferent or discontented. Enfranchise\nthem, and they become self-respecting and country-loving citizens.\nDisfranchise them, and the mark of Cain is set upon them less mercifully\nthan upon the first murderer, for no man was to hurt him. But this\nmark of inferiority--all the more palpable because of a difference of\ncolor--not only dooms the negro to be a vagabond, but makes him the prey\nof insult and outrage everywhere. While nothing may be urged here as\nto the past services of the negro, it is quite within the line of this\nappeal to remind the nation of the possibility that a time may come when\nthe services of the negro may be a second time required. History is said\nto repeat itself, and, if so, having wanted the negro once, we may want\nhim again. Can that statesmanship be wise which would leave the negro\ngood ground to hesitate, when the exigencies of the country required his\nprompt assistance? Can that be sound statesmanship which leaves millions\nof men in gloomy discontent, and possibly in a state of alienation\nin the day of national trouble? Was not the nation stronger when\ntwo hundred thousand sable soldiers were hurled against the Rebel\nfortifications, than it would have been without them? Arming the negro\nwas an urgent military necessity three years ago,--are we sure that\nanother quite as pressing may not await us? Casting aside all thought\nof justice and magnanimity, is it wise to impose upon the negro all the\nburdens involved in sustaining government against foes within and foes\nwithout, to make him equal sharer in all sacrifices for the public good,\nto tax him in peace and conscript him in war, and then coldly exclude\nhim from the ballot-box?\n\nLook across the sea. Is Ireland, in her present condition, fretful,\ndiscontented, compelled to support an establishment in which she does\nnot believe, and which the vast majority of her people abhor, a source\nof power or of weakness to Great Britain? Is not Austria wise in\nremoving all ground of complaint against her on the part of Hungary? And\ndoes not the Emperor of Russia act wisely, as well as generously, when\nhe not only breaks up the bondage of the serf, but extends him all the\nadvantages of Russian citizenship? Is the present movement in England in\nfavor of manhood suffrage--for the purpose of bringing four millions of\nBritish subjects into full sympathy and co-operation with the British\ngovernment--a wise and humane movement, or otherwise? Is the existence\nof a rebellious element in our borders--which New Orleans, Memphis, and\nTexas show to be only disarmed, but at heart as malignant as ever, only\nwaiting for an opportunity to reassert itself with fire and sword--a\nreason for leaving four millions of the nation's truest friends with\njust cause of complaint against the Federal government? If the doctrine\nthat taxation should go hand in hand with representation can be appealed\nto in behalf of recent traitors and rebels, may it not properly be\nasserted in behalf of a people who have ever been loyal and faithful\nto the government? The answers to these questions are too obvious to\nrequire statement. Disguise it as we may, we are still a divided nation.\nThe Rebel States have still an anti-national policy. Massachusetts\nand South Carolina may draw tears from the eyes of our tender-hearted\nPresident by walking arm in arm into his Philadelphia Convention, but a\ncitizen of Massachusetts is still an alien in the Palmetto State. There\nis that, all over the South, which frightens Yankee industry, capital,\nand skill from its borders. We have crushed the Rebellion, but not its\nhopes or its malign purposes. The South fought for perfect and permanent\ncontrol over the Southern laborer. It was a war of the rich against the\npoor. They who waged it had no objection to the government, while they\ncould use it as a means of confirming their power over the laborer. They\nfought the government, not because they hated the government as such,\nbut because they found it, as they thought, in the way between them and\ntheir one grand purpose of rendering permanent and indestructible their\nauthority and power over the Southern laborer. Though the battle is\nfor the present lost, the hope of gaining this object still exists, and\npervades the whole South with a feverish excitement. We have thus\nfar only gained a Union without unity, marriage without love, victory\nwithout peace. The hope of gaining by politics what they lost by the\nsword, is the secret of all this Southern unrest; and that hope must be\nextinguished before national ideas and objects can take full possession\nof the Southern mind. There is but one safe and constitutional way to\nbanish that mischievous hope from the South, and that is by lifting the\nlaborer beyond the unfriendly political designs of his former master.\nGive the negro the elective franchise, and you at once destroy the\npurely sectional policy, and wheel the Southern States into line with\nnational interests and national objects. The last and shrewdest turn\nof Southern politics is a recognition of the necessity of getting into\nCongress immediately, and at any price. The South will comply with\nany conditions but suffrage for the negro. It will swallow all the\nunconstitutional test oaths, repeal all the ordinances of Secession,\nrepudiate the Rebel debt, promise to pay the debt incurred in conquering\nits people, pass all the constitutional amendments, if only it can have\nthe negro left under its political control. The proposition is as modest\nas that made on the mountain: \"All these things will I give unto thee if\nthou wilt fall down and worship me.\"\n\nBut why are the Southerners so willing to make these sacrifices? The\nanswer plainly is, they see in this policy the only hope of saving\nsomething of their old sectional peculiarities and power. Once\nfirmly seated in Congress, their alliance with Northern Democrats\nre-established, their States restored to their former position inside\nthe Union, they can easily find means of keeping the Federal government\nentirely too busy with other important matters to pay much attention\nto the local affairs of the Southern States. Under the potent shield of\nState Rights, the game would be in their own hands. Does any sane man\ndoubt for a moment that the men who followed Jefferson Davis through the\nlate terrible Rebellion, often marching barefooted and hungry, naked and\npenniless, and who now only profess an enforced loyalty, would plunge\nthis country into a foreign war to-day, if they could thereby gain their\ncoveted independence, and their still more coveted mastery over the\nnegroes? Plainly enough, the peace not less than the prosperity of this\ncountry is involved in the great measure of impartial suffrage. King\nCotton is deposed, but only deposed, and is ready to-day to reassert all\nhis ancient pretensions upon the first favorable opportunity. Foreign\ncountries abound with his agents. They are able, vigilant, devoted. The\nyoung men of the South burn with the desire to regain what they call\nthe lost cause; the women are noisily malignant towards the Federal\ngovernment. In fact, all the elements of treason and rebellion are there\nunder the thinnest disguise which necessity can impose.\n\nWhat, then, is the work before Congress? It is to save the people of the\nSouth from themselves, and the nation from detriment on their account.\nCongress must supplant the evident sectional tendencies of the South by\nnational dispositions and tendencies. It must cause national ideas and\nobjects to take the lead and control the politics of those States. It\nmust cease to recognize the old slave-masters as the only competent\npersons to rule the South. In a word, it must enfranchise the negro, and\nby means of the loyal negroes and the loyal white men of the South build\nup a national party there, and in time bridge the chasm between North\nand South, so that our country may have a common liberty and a common\ncivilization. The new wine must be put into new bottles. The lamb may\nnot be trusted with the wolf. Loyalty is hardly safe with traitors.\n\nStatesmen of America! beware what you do. The ploughshare of rebellion\nhas gone through the land beam-deep. The soil is in readiness, and the\nseed-time has come. Nations, not less than individuals, reap as they\nsow. The dreadful calamities of the past few years came not by accident,\nnor unbidden, from the ground. You shudder to-day at the harvest of\nblood sown in the spring-time of the Republic by your patriot fathers.\nThe principle of slavery, which they tolerated under the erroneous\nimpression that it would soon die out, became at last the dominant\nprinciple and power at the South. It early mastered the Constitution,\nbecame superior to the Union, and enthroned itself above the law.\n\nFreedom of speech and of the press it slowly but successfully banished\nfrom the South, dictated its own code of honor and manners to the\nnation, brandished the bludgeon and the bowie-knife over Congressional\ndebate, sapped the foundations of loyalty, dried up the springs\nof patriotism, blotted out the testimonies of the fathers against\noppression, padlocked the pulpit, expelled liberty from its literature,\ninvented nonsensical theories about master-races and slave-races of men,\nand in due season produced a Rebellion fierce, foul, and bloody.\n\nThis evil principle again seeks admission into our body politic. It\ncomes now in shape of a denial of political rights to four million loyal\ncolored people. The South does not now ask for slavery. It only asks for\na large degraded caste, which shall have no political rights. This\nends the case. Statesmen, beware what you do. The destiny of unborn and\nunnumbered generations is in your hands. Will you repeat the mistake\nof your fathers, who sinned ignorantly? or will you profit by the\nblood-bought wisdom all round you, and forever expel every vestige of\nthe old abomination from our national borders? As you members of the\nThirty-ninth Congress decide, will the country be peaceful, united, and\nhappy, or troubled, divided, and miserable.\n\n\n\n\nTHE NEGRO EXODUS by James B. Runnion\n\n\nA recent sojourn in the South for a few weeks, chiefly in Louisiana and\nMississippi, gave the writer an opportunity to inquire into what has\nbeen so aptly called \"the negro exodus.\" The emigration of blacks to\nKansas began early in the spring of this year. For a time there was a\nstampede from two or three of the river parishes in Louisiana and\nas many counties opposite in Mississippi. Several thousand negroes\n(certainly not fewer than five thousand, and variously estimated as high\nas ten thousand) had left their cabins before the rush could be stayed\nor the excitement lulled. Early in May most of the negroes who had quit\nwork for the purpose of emigrating, but had not succeeded in getting\noff, were persuaded to return to the plantations, and from that time on\nthere have been only straggling families and groups that have watched\nfor and seized the first opportunity for transportation to the North.\nThere is no doubt, however, that there is still a consuming desire among\nthe negroes of the cotton districts in these two States to seek new\nhomes, and there are the best reasons for believing that the exodus will\ntake a new start next spring, after the gathering and conversion of the\ngrowing crop. Hundreds of negroes who returned from the river-banks for\nlack of transportation, and thousands of others infected with the ruling\ndiscontent, are working harder in the fields this summer, and practicing\nmore economy and self-denial than ever before, in order to have the\nmeans next winter and spring to pay their way to the \"promised land.\"\n\n\"We've been working for fourteen long years,\" said an intelligent negro,\nin reply to a question as to the cause of the prevailing discontent,\n\"and we ain't no better off than we was when we commenced.\" This is the\nnegro version of the trouble, which is elaborated on occasion into a\nharrowing story of oppression and plunder.\n\n\"I tell you it's all owing to the radical politicians at the North,\"\nexplained a representative of the type known as the Bourbons; \"they've\nhad their emissaries down here, and deluded the 'niggers' into a\nvery fever of emigration, with the purpose of reducing our basis of\nrepresentation in Congress and increasing that of the Northern States.\"\n\nThese are the two extremes of opinion at the South. The first is\ncertainly the more reasonable and truthful, though it implies that all\nthe blame rests upon the whites, which is not the case; the second,\npreposterous as it will appear to Northern readers, is religiously\nbelieved by large numbers of the \"unreconciled.\" Between these two\nextremes there is an infinite variety of theories, all more or less\ngoverned by the political faction to which the various theorizers\nbelong; there are at least a dozen of these factions, such as the\nBourbons, the conservatives, the native white republicans, the\ncarpet-bag republicans, the negro republicans, etc. There is a political\ntinge in almost everything in the extreme Southern States. The\nfact seems to be that the emigration movement among the blacks was\nspontaneous to the extent that they were ready and anxious to go. The\nimmediate notion of going may have been inculcated by such circulars,\nissued by railroads and land companies, as are common enough at emigrant\ncentres in the North and West, and the exaggeration characteristic of\nsuch literature may have stimulated the imagination of the negroes far\nbeyond anything they are likely to realize in their new homes. Kansas\nwas naturally the favorite goal of the negro emigre, for it was\nassociated in his mind with the names of Jim Lane and John Brown, which\nare hallowed to him. The timid learned that they could escape what they\nhave come to regard as a second bondage, and they flocked together to\ngain the moral support which comes from numbers.\n\nDiligent inquiry among representative men, of all classes and from\nall parts of Louisiana, who were in attendance at the constitutional\nconvention in New Orleans, and careful observation along the river among\nthe land owners and field hands in both Louisiana and Mississippi, left\na vivid impression of some material and political conditions which fully\naccount for the negro exodus. I have dropped the social conditions out\nof the consideration, because I became convinced that the race troubles\nat the South can be solved to the satisfaction of both whites and blacks\nwithout cultivating any closer social relations than those which now\nprevail. The material conditions which I have in mind are less familiar\nthan the political conditions; they are mainly the land-tenure and\ncredit systems, and mere modifications (scarcely for the better) of the\npeculiar plantation system of slavery days.\n\nThe cotton lands at the South are owned now, as they were before the\nwar, in large tracts. The land was about all that most of the Southern\nwhites had left to them after the war, and they kept it when they could,\nat the first, in the hope that it would yield them a living through the\nlabor of the blacks; of late years they have not been able to sell their\nplantations at any fair price, if they desired to do so. The white men\nwith capital who went to the South from the North after the war seemed\nto acquire the true Southern ambition to be large land owners and\nplanters; and when the ante-bellum owners lost their plantations the\nland usually went in bulk to the city factors who had made them advances\nfrom year to year, and had taken mortgages on their crops and broad\nacres. As a consequence, the land has never been distributed among\nthe people who inhabit and cultivate it, and agricultural labor in the\nSouthern States approaches the condition of the factory labor in England\nand the Eastern States more nearly than it does the farm labor of the\nNorth and West. Nearly every agricultural laborer north of Mason and\nDixon's line, if not the actual possessor of the land he plows, looks\nforward to owning a farm some time; at the South such an ambition is\nrare, and small ownership still more an exception. The practice of\npaying day wages was first tried after the war; this practice is still\nin vogue in the sugar and rice districts, where laborers are paid from\nfifty to seventy cents per day, with quarters furnished and living\nguaranteed them at nine or ten cents a day. In sections where the wages\nsystem prevails, and where there have been no political disturbances,\nthe negroes seem to be perfectly contented; at all events, the\nemigration fever has not spread among them. But it was found\nimpracticable to maintain the wage system in the cotton districts. The\nnegroes themselves fought against it, because it reminded them too much\nof the slave-gang, driven out at daybreak and home at sundown. In many\ncases the planters were forced to abandon it, because they had not the\nmeans to carry on such huge farming, and they could not secure the same\nliberal advances from capitalists as when they were able to mortgage\na growing \"crop of niggers.\" Then the system of working on shares was\ntried. This was reasonably fair, and the negro laborers were satisfied\nas long as it lasted. The owners of the land, under this system, would\nfurnish the indispensable mule and the farming implements, and take one\nhalf the product. The planters themselves relinquished this system. Some\nof them contend that the laziness and indifference of the negro made the\npartnership undesirable; many others admit that they were not able to\nadvance the negro tenant his supplies pending the growth of the year's\ncrop, as it was necessary they should do under the sharing system.\nNow the renting system is almost universal. It yields the land owner a\ncertainty, endangered only by the death, sickness, or desertion of the\nnegro tenant; but it throws the latter upon his own responsibility, and\nfrequently makes him the victim of his own ignorance and the rapacity\nof the white man. The rent of land, on a money basis, varies from six to\nten dollars an acre per year, while the same land can be bought in\nlarge quantities all the way from fifteen to thirty dollars per acre,\naccording to location, clearing, improvement, richness, etc. When paid\nin product, the rent varies from eighty to one hundred pounds of lint\ncotton per acre for land that produces from two hundred to four hundred\npounds of cotton per acre; the tenant undertakes to pay from one quarter\nto one half--perhaps an average of one third--of his crop for the use\nof the land, without stock, tools, or assistance of any kind. The land\nowners usually claim that they make no money even at these exorbitant\nfigures. If they do not, it is because only a portion of their vast\npossessions is under cultivation, because they do no work themselves,\nand in some cases because the negroes do not cultivate and gather as\nlarge a crop as they could and ought to harvest. It is very certain that\nthe negro tenants, as a class, make no money; if they are out of debt at\nthe end of a season, they have reason to rejoice.\n\nThe credit system, which is as universal as the renting system, is even\nmore illogical and oppressive. The utter viciousness of both systems in\ntheir mutual dependence is sufficiently illustrated by the single fact\nthat, after fourteen years of freedom and labor on their own account,\nthe great mass of the negroes depend for their living on an advance of\nsupplies (as they need food, clothing, or tools during the year) upon\nthe pledge of their growing crop. This is a generic imitation of the\nwhite man's improvidence during the slavery times; then the planters\nmortgaged their crops and negroes, and where one used the advances to\nextend his plantation, ten squandered the money. The negro's necessities\nhave developed an offensive race, called merchants by courtesy, who keep\nsupply stores at the cross-roads and steamboat landings, and live upon\nextortion. These people would be called sharks, harpies, and vampires in\nany Northwestern agricultural community, and they would not survive more\nthan one season. The country merchant advances the negro tenant such\nsupplies as the negro wants up to a certain amount, previously fixed\nby contract, and charges the negro at least double the value of every\narticle sold to him. There is no concealment about the extortion; every\nstore-keeper has his cash price and his credit price, and in nearly all\ncases the latter is one hundred per cent. higher than the former. The\nextortion is justified by those who practice it on the ground that\ntheir losses by bad debts, though their advances are always secured by\nmortgage on the growing crop, overbalance the profits; this assertion is\nscarcely borne out by the comparative opulence of the \"merchant\" and\nthe pitiful poverty of the laborer. Some of the largest and wealthiest\nplanters have sought to protect their tenants from the merciless\nclutches of the contrary merchant, who is more frequently than not an\nIsraelite, by advancing supplies of necessary articles at reasonable\nprices. But the necessities of the planter, if not his greed, often\nbetray him into plundering the negro. The planter himself is generally a\nvictim to usury. He still draws on the city factor to the extent of ten\ndollars a bale upon his estimated crop. He pays this factor two and one\nhalf per cent. commission for the advance, eight per cent. interest for\nthe money, two and one half per cent. more for disposing of the crop\nwhen consigned to him, and sometimes still another commission for the\npurchase of the supplies. The planter who furnishes his tenants with\nsupplies on credit is usually paying an interest of fifteen to eighteen\nper cent. himself, and necessarily takes some risk in advancing upon\nan uncertain crop and to a laborer whom he believes to be neither\nscrupulous nor industrious; these conditions necessitate more than the\nordinary profit, and in many cases suggest exorbitant and unreasonable\ncharges. But whether the negro deals with the merchant or the land\nowner, his extravagance almost invariably exhausts his credit, even if\nit be large. The negro is a sensuous creature, and luxurious in his way.\nThe male is an enormous consumer of tobacco and whisky; the female\nhas an inordinate love for flummery; both are fond of sardines, potted\nmeats, and canned goods generally, and they indulge themselves without\nany other restraint than the refusal of their merchant to sell to them.\nThe man who advances supplies watches his negro customers constantly;\nif they are working well and their crop promises to be large, he will\npermit and even encourage them to draw upon him liberally; it is only a\npartial failure of the crop, or some intimation of the negro's intention\nto shirk his obligations, that induces his country factor to preach the\nvirtue of self-restraint, or moralize upon the advantages of economy.\n\nThe land owner's rent and the merchant's advances are both secured by a\nchattel mortgage on the tenant's personal property, and by a pledge of\nthe growing crop. The hired laborer (for it is common for negroes to\nwork for wages for other negroes who rent lands) has also a lien upon\nthe growing crops second only to the land owner's; but as the law\nrequires that the liens shall be recorded, which the ignorant laborer\nusually neglects and the shrewd merchant never fails to do, the former\nis generally cheated of his security. Among those who usually work for\nhire are the women, who are expert cotton pickers, and the loss of wages\nwhich so many of them have suffered by reason of the prior lien gained\nby landlord and merchant has helped to make them earnest and effective\nadvocates of emigration. The Western farmer considers it hard enough to\nstruggle under one mortgage at a reasonable interest; the negro tenant\nbegins his season with three mortgages, covering all he owns, his labor\nfor the coming year, and all he expects to acquire during that period.\nHe pays one third his product for the use of the land; he pays double\nthe value of all he consumes; he pays an exorbitant fee for recording\nthe contract by which he pledges his pound of flesh; he is charged two\nor three times as much as he ought to pay for ginning his cotton;\nand, finally, he turns over his crop to be eaten up in commissions, if\nanything still be left to him. It is easy to understand why the negro\nrarely gets ahead in the world. This mortgaging of future services,\nwhich is practically what a pledge of the growing crop amounts to, is in\nthe nature of bondage. It has a tendency to make the negro extravagant,\nreckless, and unscrupulous; he has become convinced from previous\nexperience that nothing will be coming to him on the day of settlement,\nand he is frequently actuated by the purpose of getting as much as\npossible and working as little as possible. Cases are numerous in which\nthe negro abandons his own crop at picking time, because he knows that\nhe has already eaten up its full value; and so he goes to picking for\nwages on some other plantation. In other cases, where negroes have\nacquired mules and farming implements upon which a merchant has secured\na mortgage in the manner described, they are practically bound to that\nmerchant from year to year, in order to retain their property; if he\nremoves from one section to another, they must follow him, and rent\nand cultivate lands in his neighborhood. It is only the ignorance,\nthe improvidence, and the happy disposition of the negro, under the\ninfluence of the lazy, drowsy climate, to which he is so well adapted\nphysically, that have enabled him to endure these hardships so long.\nAnd, though the negro is the loser, the white man is not often the\ngainer, from this false plantation and mercantile system. The incidental\nrisk may not be so large as the planter and merchant pretend, but the\ncondition of the people is an evidence that the extortion they practice\nyields no better profit in the long run than would be gained by\ncompetition in fair prices on a cash system; and in leading up to a\ngeneral emigration of the laboring population the abuses described will\neventually ruin and impoverish those who have heretofore been the only\nbeneficiaries thereof. The decay of improvements inevitable under annual\nrentings, the lack of sufficient labor to cultivate all the good land,\nand the universal idleness of the rural whites have kept the land\nowners comparatively poor; the partial failure of crops and the\nunscrupulousness of the negro debtor, engendered by the infamous\nexactions of his creditor, have prevented the merchants, as a class,\nfrom prospering as much as might be supposed; and, finally, the uniform\ninjustice to the laborers induces them to fly to ills they know not of,\nrather than bear those they have. It is a blessing to the negro that\nthe laws do not yet provide for a detention of the person in the case of\ndebt, or escape would be shut off entirely; as it is, various influences\nand circumstances appertaining to the system in vogue have been used\nto prevent the easy flight of those who desire to go, and have detained\nthousands of blacks for a time who are fretting to quit the country.\n\nPolitical oppression has contributed largely to the discontent which\nis the prime cause of the exodus. \"Bulldozing\" is the term by which\nall forms of this oppression are known. The native whites are generally\nindisposed to confess that the negroes are quitting the country on\naccount of political injustice and persecution; even those who freely\nadmit and fitly characterize the abuses already described seek to deny,\nor at least belittle, the political abuses. The fact that a large number\nof negroes have emigrated from Madison Parish, Louisiana, where there\nhas never been any bulldozing, and where the negroes are in full\nand undisputed political control, is cited as proof that political\ndisturbances cut no figure in the case. But the town of Delta, in\nMadison Parish, is at once on the river and the terminus of a railroad\nthat runs back through the interior of the State; thus Madison Parish\nwould furnish the natural exit for the fugitives from the adjoining\ncounties, where there have been political disturbances. It would be just\nas reasonable to contend that the plundering of the negroes has had no\ninfluence in driving them away, since many of those who have emigrated\nwere among the most prosperous of the blacks, as to deny the agency\nof political persecution. Families that had been able to accumulate\na certain amount of personal property, in spite of the extortionate\npractices, sold their mules, their implements, their cows, their\npigs, their sheep, and their household goods for anything they would\nbring,--frequently as low as one sixth of their value,--in order that\nthey might improve an immediate opportunity to go away; it is evident\nthat there must have been some cause outside of extortion in their case.\nThere are candid native whites who do not deny, but justify, the violent\nmethods which have been employed to disfranchise the negroes, or compel\nthem to vote under white dictation, in many parts of Louisiana and\nMississippi, on the ground that the men who pay the taxes should vote\nthem and control the disbursement of the public moneys. The gentlemen\nwho advance this argument seem to ignore the fact that the very\nNortherner whom they are seeking to convert to \"the Mississippi plan\"\nmay himself be a taxpayer in some Northern city, where public affairs\nare controlled by a class of voters in every way as ignorant and\nirresponsible as the blacks, but where bulldozing has never yet\nbeen suggested as a remedy. For the rest, the evidences of political\noppression are abundant and convincing. The bulldozers as a class are\nmore impecunious and irresponsible than the negroes, and, unlike the\nnegroes, they will not work. There has been more of the \"night-riding,\"\nthe whippings, the mysterious disappearances, the hangings, and the\nterrorism comprehended in the term bulldozing than has been reported\nby those \"abstracts and brief chronicles of the time,\" the Southern\nnewspapers, which are now all of one party, and defer to the ruling\nsentiment among the whites. The exodus has wrung from two or three of\nthe more candid and independent journals, however, a virtual confession\nof the fiendish practices of bulldozing in their insistance that these\npractices must be abandoned. The non-resident land owners and the\nresident planters, the city factors and the country merchants of means\nand respectability, have taken no personal part in the terrorizing of\nthe negro, but they have tolerated it, and sometimes encouraged it, in\norder to gratify their preference for \"white government.\" The negroes\nhave suffered the more because they have not resisted and defended\nthemselves; now they have begun to convince those who have persecuted\nthem that, if they will not strike back, they can and will run away.\nNo one who is at all familiar with the freedman can doubt that the\nabridgment of his political rights has been one of the main causes of\nthe exodus. Voting is widely regarded at the North as a disagreeable\nduty, but the negro looks upon it as the highest privilege in life; to\nbe frightened out of the exercise of this privilege, or compelled to\nexercise it in conflict with his convictions and preferences, is to\nsuffer from a cruel injustice, which the negro will now try to escape,\nsince he has learned that escape is possible. The women, though free\nfrom personal assaults, suffer from the terrorism that prevails in\ncertain districts as much as the men. \"We might as well starve or freeze\nto death in Kansas,\" they say, \"as to be shot-gunned here.\" If they talk\nto you in confidence, they declare that the ruling purpose is to escape\nfrom the \"slaughter-pens\" of the South. Political persecution, and not\nthe extortion they suffer, is the refrain of all the speakers at negro\nmeetings that are held in encouragement and aid of the emigration. It is\nidle to deny that the varied injustice which the negroes have suffered\nas voters is accountable for a large part of their universal yearning\nfor new homes, and it will be folly for the responsible classes at the\nSouth to ignore this fact.\n\nAs it is the negroes who are fleeing from the South, it is natural to\nlook among the dominant class for the injustice which is driving them\naway; but it would be unfair to conclude that the blame rests entirely\nupon the whites, and still more so to leave the impression that there\nis no extenuation for the mistakes and abuses for which the whites are\nresponsible. Much of the intimidation of the blacks has been tolerated,\nif not suggested, by a fear of negro uprisings. The apprehension is a\nlegacy from the days of slavery, and is more unreasonable now than\nit was then; but still it exists. This is not an excuse, but an\nexplanation. The Pharaohs of the time of Moses were in constant dread\nlest the Hebrews under their rule should go over to their enemies, and\ntheir dread doubtless increased the cruelty of the Egyptians; but, while\nthis dread was an extenuation in the eyes of the persecutors, it did\nnot prevent the Hebrews from fleeing the persecution. So the blacks are\ngoing without regard to the justification which the whites may set up\nfor their treatment; the only difference between the old and new exodus\nis that, as the writer heard one negro speaker express it, \"every black\nman is his own Moses in this exodus.\" The negro may be lazy; it seems\nimpossible to be otherwise in the Southern climate. He may not be\nwilling to work on Saturdays, no matter how urgent the necessity; the\nindulgence in holidays is said to be one of the chief drawbacks to the\nadvancement of the emancipated serfs of Russia. The blacks are certainly\nextravagant in their way, though the word seems to be almost misused in\nconnection with a race who live largely on pork and molasses, and rarely\nwear more than half a dollar's worth of clothes at one time. They have\nnot the instinct of home as it prevails among the whites, but incline\nto a crude and unsystematic communism; the negro quarters of the old\nplantations are all huddled together in the centre, and, except where\nthe land owners have interfered to encourage a different life, there is\nstill too much promiscuousness in the relation of the sexes. The negro,\nas a rule, has no ambition to become a land owner; he prefers to invest\nhis surplus money, when he has any, in personal and movable property.\nIn most cases where the blacks have been given the opportunity of buying\nland on long time, and paying yearly installments out of the proceeds of\ntheir annual crops, they have tired of the bargain after a year or two,\nand abandoned the contract. The negro politicians and preachers are not\nall that reformers and moralists would have them; the imitative faculty\nof the African has betrayed the black politician into many of the\nvicious ways of the white politician, and the colored preacher is\nfrequently not above \"the pomps and vanity of this wicked world.\" All\nthis is the more unfortunate, as the blacks have a child-like confidence\nin their chosen leaders, founded partly on their primitive character,\nand partly on their distrust of the native whites. Both their\npoliticians and their preachers have given abundant evidence of their\ninsincerity during the excitement of emigration by blowing hot and\nblowing cold; by talking to the negroes one way, and to the whites\nanother; and even to the extent, in some instances, of taking money to\nuse their influence for discouraging and impeding emigration. These are\nsome of the faults and misfortunes on the part of the blacks which enter\ninto the race troubles. The chief blame which attaches to the whites\nis the failure to make a persistent effort, by education and kind\ntreatment, to overcome the distrust and cure the faults of the\nnegroes. The whites control, because they constitute the \"property and\nintelligence\" of the South, to use the words of a democratic statesman;\nthis power should have been used to gain the confidence of the blacks.\nHad such a course been taken, there would not have been the fear of\nreenslavement, which actually prevails to a considerable extent among\nthe negroes. So long as a portion of the whites entertain the conviction\nthat the war of the sections will be renewed within a few years, as is\nthe case, the negroes will suspect and dread the class who would treat\nthem as enemies in case the war should come, and will seek to escape to\na section of the country where they would not be so treated. Perhaps,\ntoo, there would have been a voluntary political division among the\nblack voters, had the whites used more pacific means to bring it about,\nand had they themselves set the example. And last, but not least, in\nmaking up the sum of blame that the whites must bear, is their own\nunwillingness to labor, which gives the rural population too much time\nfor mischief and too little sympathy with the working classes.\n\nAs we have traced the causes that have led to the exodus, and described\nthe conditions which warrant the belief that there will be a renewal of\nthe emigration on a more extended scale next spring, and endeavored to\ndistribute the responsibility for the troubles equitably among whites\nand blacks, remedies have naturally suggested themselves to the reader;\nin fact, they are more easily to be thought out than accomplished. A\nfew general reflections may be added, however, in order to indicate\nthe probable solution of the race troubles that have brought about the\nexodus, if, indeed, the whites and blacks of the South are ever going to\nlive together in peace.\n\n(1.) It is certain that negro labor is the best the South can have, and\nequally certain that the climate and natural conditions of the South\nare better suited to the negro than any others on this continent.\nThe alluvial lands, which many persons believe the negroes alone can\ncultivate, on account of climatic conditions, are so rich that it might\nliterally be said it is only necessary to tickle them with a hoe to make\nthem laugh back a harvest. The common prosperity of the country--the\nagricultural interests of the South and the commercial interests of the\nNorth--will be best served, therefore, by the continued residence and\nlabor of the blacks in the cotton States.\n\n(2.) The fact stated in the foregoing paragraph is so well understood at\nthe North that the Southern people should dismiss the idea that there is\nany scheming among the Northern people, political or otherwise, to draw\nthe black labor away from its natural home. The same fact should also\ninfluence the people at the North not to be misled by any professional\nphilanthropists who may have some self-interest in soliciting aid to\nfacilitate negro emigration from the South. The duty of the North in\nthis matter is simply to extend protection and assure safe-conduct\nto the negroes, if the Southern whites attempt to impede voluntary\nemigration by either law or violence. Any other course might be cruel\nto the negro in encouraging him to enter on a new life in a strange\nclimate, as well as an injustice to the white land owners of the South.\n\n(3.) There is danger that the Southern whites will, as a rule,\nmisinterpret the meaning of the exodus. Many are inclined to underrate\nits importance, and those who appreciate its significance are apt to\nlook for temporary and superficial remedies. The vague promises made at\nthe Vicksburg convention, which was controlled by the whites, and called\nto consider the emigration movement, have had no influence with\nthe negroes, because they have heard such promises before. Had the\nconvention adopted some definite plan of action, such as ex-Governor\nFoote, of Mississippi, submitted, its session might not have been in\nvain. This plan was to establish a committee in every county, composed\nof men who have the confidence of both whites and blacks, that should\nbe auxiliary to the public authorities, listen to complaints, and\narbitrate, advise, conciliate, or prosecute, as each case should demand.\nIt is short-sighted for the Southern people to make mere temporary\nconcessions, such as have been made in some cases this year, for that\ncourse would establish an annual strike. It is folly for them to suppose\nthey can stem the tide of emigration by influencing the regular lines of\nsteamboats not to carry the refugees, for the people of the North will\nsee that the blacks shall not be detained in the South against their\nwill. It is unwise for them to devise schemes for importing Chinese,\nor encouraging the immigration of white labor as a substitute for negro\nlabor, when they may much better bestir themselves to make the present\neffective labor content.\n\n(4.) Education will be the most useful agent to employ in the permanent\nharmonizing of the two races, and the redemption of both from the faults\nand follies which constitute their troubles. It is not the education of\nthe negro alone, whose ambition for learning is increasing notably with\nevery new generation, but the education of the mass of the young whites,\nthat is needed to inculcate more tolerance of color and opinion, to give\nthem an aspiration beyond that of riding a horse and hanging a \"nigger,\"\nand to enable them to set a better example to the imitative blacks in\nthe way of work and frugality. The blacks need the education to protect\nthem from designing white men; the whites need it to teach them that\ntheir own interests will be best served by abandoning bulldozing of all\nkinds.\n\n(5.) Reform in the land tenure, by converting the plantation monopolies\ninto small holdings; abolition of the credit system, by abandoning the\nlaws which sustain it; a diversification of crops; and attention to\nnew manufacturing, maritime, and commercial enterprises,--these are the\nmaterial changes that are most needed. They can be secured only through\nthe active and earnest efforts of the whites. The blacks will be found\nresponsive.\n\n(6.) The hope of the negro exodus at its present stage, or even if it\nshall continue another season, is that the actual loss of the valuable\nlabor that has gone, and the prospective loss of more labor that is\nanxious to go, will induce the intelligent and responsible classes\nat the South to overcome their own prejudices, and to compel the\nextremists, irreconcilables, and politicians generally, of all parties,\nto abandon agitation, and give the South equal peace and equal chance\nfor black and white.\n\n\n\n\nMY ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY by Frederick Douglass\n\n\nIn the first narrative of my experience in slavery, written nearly forty\nyears ago, and in various writings since, I have given the public what I\nconsidered very good reasons for withholding the manner of my escape. In\nsubstance these reasons were, first, that such publication at any time\nduring the existence of slavery might be used by the master against the\nslave, and prevent the future escape of any who might adopt the same\nmeans that I did. The second reason was, if possible, still more binding\nto silence: the publication of details would certainly have put in peril\nthe persons and property of those who assisted. Murder itself was not\nmore sternly and certainly punished in the State of Maryland than that\nof aiding and abetting the escape of a slave. Many colored men, for\nno other crime than that of giving aid to a fugitive slave, have, like\nCharles T. Torrey, perished in prison. The abolition of slavery in my\nnative State and throughout the country, and the lapse of time, render\nthe caution hitherto observed no longer necessary. But even since the\nabolition of slavery, I have sometimes thought it well enough to baffle\ncuriosity by saying that while slavery existed there were good reasons\nfor not telling the manner of my escape, and since slavery had ceased to\nexist, there was no reason for telling it. I shall now, however, cease\nto avail myself of this formula, and, as far as I can, endeavor to\nsatisfy this very natural curiosity. I should, perhaps, have yielded to\nthat feeling sooner, had there been anything very heroic or thrilling\nin the incidents connected with my escape, for I am sorry to say I\nhave nothing of that sort to tell; and yet the courage that could risk\nbetrayal and the bravery which was ready to encounter death, if need be,\nin pursuit of freedom, were essential features in the undertaking. My\nsuccess was due to address rather than courage, to good luck rather than\nbravery. My means of escape were provided for me by the very men who\nwere making laws to hold and bind me more securely in slavery.\n\nIt was the custom in the State of Maryland to require the free colored\npeople to have what were called free papers. These instruments they were\nrequired to renew very often, and by charging a fee for this writing,\nconsiderable sums from time to time were collected by the State. In\nthese papers the name, age, color, height, and form of the freeman were\ndescribed, together with any scars or other marks upon his person which\ncould assist in his identification. This device in some measure defeated\nitself--since more than one man could be found to answer the same\ngeneral description. Hence many slaves could escape by personating the\nowner of one set of papers; and this was often done as follows: A\nslave, nearly or sufficiently answering the description set forth in the\npapers, would borrow or hire them till by means of them he could escape\nto a free State, and then, by mail or otherwise, would return them to\nthe owner. The operation was a hazardous one for the lender as well as\nfor the borrower. A failure on the part of the fugitive to send back the\npapers would imperil his benefactor, and the discovery of the papers\nin possession of the wrong man would imperil both the fugitive and his\nfriend. It was, therefore, an act of supreme trust on the part of a\nfreeman of color thus to put in jeopardy his own liberty that another\nmight be free. It was, however, not unfrequently bravely done, and was\nseldom discovered. I was not so fortunate as to resemble any of my free\nacquaintances sufficiently to answer the description of their papers.\nBut I had a friend--a sailor--who owned a sailor's protection, which\nanswered somewhat the purpose of free papers--describing his person,\nand certifying to the fact that he was a free American sailor. The\ninstrument had at its head the American eagle, which gave it the\nappearance at once of an authorized document. This protection, when in\nmy hands, did not describe its bearer very accurately. Indeed, it called\nfor a man much darker than myself, and close examination of it would\nhave caused my arrest at the start.\n\nIn order to avoid this fatal scrutiny on the part of railroad officials,\nI arranged with Isaac Rolls, a Baltimore hackman, to bring my baggage to\nthe Philadelphia train just on the moment of starting, and jumped upon\nthe car myself when the train was in motion. Had I gone into the station\nand offered to purchase a ticket, I should have been instantly and\ncarefully examined, and undoubtedly arrested. In choosing this plan\nI considered the jostle of the train, and the natural haste of the\nconductor, in a train crowded with passengers, and relied upon my skill\nand address in playing the sailor, as described in my protection, to do\nthe rest. One element in my favor was the kind feeling which prevailed\nin Baltimore and other sea-ports at the time, toward \"those who go\ndown to the sea in ships.\" \"Free trade and sailors' rights\" just then\nexpressed the sentiment of the country. In my clothing I was rigged out\nin sailor style. I had on a red shirt and a tarpaulin hat, and a black\ncravat tied in sailor fashion carelessly and loosely about my neck. My\nknowledge of ships and sailor's talk came much to my assistance, for\nI knew a ship from stem to stern, and from keelson to cross-trees, and\ncould talk sailor like an \"old salt.\" I was well on the way to Havre de\nGrace before the conductor came into the negro car to collect tickets\nand examine the papers of his black passengers. This was a critical\nmoment in the drama. My whole future depended upon the decision of this\nconductor. Agitated though I was while this ceremony was proceeding,\nstill, externally, at least, I was apparently calm and self-possessed.\nHe went on with his duty--examining several colored passengers before\nreaching me. He was somewhat harsh in tome and peremptory in manner\nuntil he reached me, when, strange enough, and to my surprise and\nrelief, his whole manner changed. Seeing that I did not readily produce\nmy free papers, as the other colored persons in the car had done, he\nsaid to me, in friendly contrast with his bearing toward the others:\n\n\"I suppose you have your free papers?\"\n\nTo which I answered:\n\n\"No sir; I never carry my free papers to sea with me.\"\n\n\"But you have something to show that you are a freeman, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I answered; \"I have a paper with the American Eagle on it,\nand that will carry me around the world.\"\n\nWith this I drew from my deep sailor's pocket my seaman's protection, as\nbefore described. The merest glance at the paper satisfied him, and he\ntook my fare and went on about his business. This moment of time was one\nof the most anxious I ever experienced. Had the conductor looked closely\nat the paper, he could not have failed to discover that it called for\na very different-looking person from myself, and in that case it would\nhave been his duty to arrest me on the instant, and send me back to\nBaltimore from the first station. When he left me with the assurance\nthat I was all right, though much relieved, I realized that I was still\nin great danger: I was still in Maryland, and subject to arrest at any\nmoment. I saw on the train several persons who would have known me in\nany other clothes, and I feared they might recognize me, even in my\nsailor \"rig,\" and report me to the conductor, who would then subject me\nto a closer examination, which I knew well would be fatal to me.\n\nThough I was not a murderer fleeing from justice, I felt perhaps quite\nas miserable as such a criminal. The train was moving at a very high\nrate of speed for that epoch of railroad travel, but to my anxious mind\nit was moving far too slowly. Minutes were hours, and hours were days\nduring this part of my flight. After Maryland, I was to pass through\nDelaware--another slave State, where slave-catchers generally awaited\ntheir prey, for it was not in the interior of the State, but on its\nborders, that these human hounds were most vigilant and active. The\nborder lines between slavery and freedom were the dangerous ones for the\nfugitives. The heart of no fox or deer, with hungry hounds on his trail\nin full chase, could have beaten more anxiously or noisily than did mine\nfrom the time I left Baltimore till I reached Philadelphia. The passage\nof the Susquehanna River at Havre de Grace was at that time made by\nferry-boat, on board of which I met a young colored man by the name of\nNichols, who came very near betraying me. He was a \"hand\" on the boat,\nbut, instead of minding his business, he insisted upon knowing me, and\nasking me dangerous questions as to where I was going, when I was coming\nback, etc. I got away from my old and inconvenient acquaintance as soon\nas I could decently do so, and went to another part of the boat. Once\nacross the river, I encountered a new danger. Only a few days before,\nI had been at work on a revenue cutter, in Mr. Price's ship-yard in\nBaltimore, under the care of Captain McGowan. On the meeting at this\npoint of the two trains, the one going south stopped on the track just\nopposite to the one going north, and it so happened that this Captain\nMcGowan sat at a window where he could see me very distinctly, and\nwould certainly have recognized me had he looked at me but for a second.\nFortunately, in the hurry of the moment, he did not see me; and the\ntrains soon passed each other on their respective ways. But this was not\nmy only hair-breadth escape. A German blacksmith whom I knew well was on\nthe train with me, and looked at me very intently, as if he thought he\nhad seen me somewhere before in his travels. I really believe he knew\nme, but had no heart to betray me. At any rate, he saw me escaping and\nheld his peace.\n\nThe last point of imminent danger, and the one I dreaded most,\nwas Wilmington. Here we left the train and took the steam-boat for\nPhiladelphia. In making the change here I again apprehended arrest, but\nno one disturbed me, and I was soon on the broad and beautiful Delaware,\nspeeding away to the Quaker City. On reaching Philadelphia in the\nafternoon, I inquired of a colored man how I could get on to New York.\nHe directed me to the William-street depot, and thither I went, taking\nthe train that night. I reached New York Tuesday morning, having\ncompleted the journey in less than twenty-four hours.\n\nMy free life began on the third of September, 1838. On the morning of\nthe fourth of that month, after an anxious and most perilous but safe\njourney, I found myself in the big city of New York, a FREE MAN--one\nmore added to the mighty throng which, like the confused waves of the\ntroubled sea, surged to and fro between the lofty walls of Broadway.\nThough dazzled with the wonders which met me on every hand, my thoughts\ncould not be much withdrawn from my strange situation. For the moment,\nthe dreams of my youth and the hopes of my manhood were completely\nfulfilled. The bonds that had held me to \"old master\" were broken. No\nman now had a right to call me his slave or assert mastery over me. I\nwas in the rough and tumble of an outdoor world, to take my chance with\nthe rest of its busy number. I have often been asked how I felt when\nfirst I found myself on free soil. There is scarcely anything in my\nexperience about which I could not give a more satisfactory answer. A\nnew world had opened upon me. If life is more than breath and the \"quick\nround of blood,\" I lived more in that one day than in a year of my slave\nlife. It was a time of joyous excitement which words can but tamely\ndescribe. In a letter written to a friend soon after reaching New York,\nI said: \"I felt as one might feel upon escape from a den of hungry\nlions.\" Anguish and grief, like darkness and rain, may be depicted; but\ngladness and joy, like the rainbow, defy the skill of pen or pencil.\nDuring ten or fifteen years I had been, as it were, dragging a heavy\nchain which no strength of mine could break; I was not only a slave, but\na slave for life. I might become a husband, a father, an aged man, but\nthrough all, from birth to death, from the cradle to the grave, I had\nfelt myself doomed. All efforts I had previously made to secure my\nfreedom had not only failed, but had seemed only to rivet my fetters the\nmore firmly, and to render my escape more difficult. Baffled, entangled,\nand discouraged, I had at times asked myself the question, May not my\ncondition after all be God's work, and ordered for a wise purpose, and\nif so, Is not submission my duty? A contest had in fact been going on\nin my mind for a long time, between the clear consciousness of right and\nthe plausible make-shifts of theology and superstition. The one held me\nan abject slave--a prisoner for life, punished for some transgression\nin which I had no lot nor part; and the other counseled me to manly\nendeavor to secure my freedom. This contest was now ended; my chains\nwere broken, and the victory brought me unspeakable joy.\n\nBut my gladness was short-lived, for I was not yet out of the reach and\npower of the slave-holders. I soon found that New York was not quite so\nfree or so safe a refuge as I had supposed, and a sense of loneliness\nand insecurity again oppressed me most sadly. I chanced to meet on the\nstreet, a few hours after my landing, a fugitive slave whom I had once\nknown well in slavery. The information received from him alarmed me. The\nfugitive in question was known in Baltimore as \"Allender's Jake,\" but in\nNew York he wore the more respectable name of \"William Dixon.\" Jake, in\nlaw, was the property of Doctor Allender, and Tolly Allender, the son\nof the doctor, had once made an effort to recapture MR. DIXON, but\nhad failed for want of evidence to support his claim. Jake told me the\ncircumstances of this attempt, and how narrowly he escaped being sent\nback to slavery and torture. He told me that New York was then full\nof Southerners returning from the Northern watering-places; that the\ncolored people of New York were not to be trusted; that there were hired\nmen of my own color who would betray me for a few dollars; that there\nwere hired men ever on the lookout for fugitives; that I must trust\nno man with my secret; that I must not think of going either upon the\nwharves or into any colored boarding-house, for all such places were\nclosely watched; that he was himself unable to help me; and, in fact, he\nseemed while speaking to me to fear lest I myself might be a spy and\na betrayer. Under this apprehension, as I suppose, he showed signs of\nwishing to be rid of me, and with whitewash brush in hand, in search of\nwork, he soon disappeared.\n\nThis picture, given by poor \"Jake,\" of New York, was a damper to my\nenthusiasm. My little store of money would soon be exhausted, and since\nit would be unsafe for me to go on the wharves for work, and I had no\nintroductions elsewhere, the prospect for me was far from cheerful. I\nsaw the wisdom of keeping away from the ship-yards, for, if pursued, as\nI felt certain I should be, Mr. Auld, my \"master,\" would naturally seek\nme there among the calkers. Every door seemed closed against me. I was\nin the midst of an ocean of my fellow-men, and yet a perfect stranger\nto every one. I was without home, without acquaintance, without money,\nwithout credit, without work, and without any definite knowledge as to\nwhat course to take, or where to look for succor. In such an extremity,\na man had something besides his new-born freedom to think of. While\nwandering about the streets of New York, and lodging at least one\nnight among the barrels on one of the wharves, I was indeed free--from\nslavery, but free from food and shelter as well. I kept my secret to\nmyself as long as I could, but I was compelled at last to seek some\none who would befriend me without taking advantage of my destitution\nto betray me. Such a person I found in a sailor named Stuart, a\nwarm-hearted and generous fellow, who, from his humble home on Centre\nstreet, saw me standing on the opposite sidewalk, near the Tombs prison.\nAs he approached me, I ventured a remark to him which at once enlisted\nhis interest in me. He took me to his home to spend the night, and in\nthe morning went with me to Mr. David Ruggles, the secretary of the New\nYork Vigilance Committee, a co-worker with Isaac T. Hopper, Lewis and\nArthur Tappan, Theodore S. Wright, Samuel Cornish, Thomas Downing,\nPhilip A. Bell, and other true men of their time. All these (save Mr.\nBell, who still lives, and is editor and publisher of a paper called the\n\"Elevator,\" in San Francisco) have finished their work on earth. Once in\nthe hands of these brave and wise men, I felt comparatively safe. With\nMr. Ruggles, on the corner of Lispenard and Church streets, I was hidden\nseveral days, during which time my intended wife came on from Baltimore\nat my call, to share the burdens of life with me. She was a free woman,\nand came at once on getting the good news of my safety. We were\nmarried by Rev. J. W. C. Pennington, then a well-known and respected\nPresbyterian minister. I had no money with which to pay the marriage\nfee, but he seemed well pleased with our thanks.\n\nMr. Ruggles was the first officer on the \"Underground Railroad\" whom I\nmet after coming North, and was, indeed, the only one with whom I had\nanything to do till I became such an officer myself. Learning that my\ntrade was that of a calker, he promptly decided that the best place\nfor me was in New Bedford, Mass. He told me that many ships for whaling\nvoyages were fitted out there, and that I might there find work at my\ntrade and make a good living. So, on the day of the marriage ceremony,\nwe took our little luggage to the steamer JOHN W. RICHMOND, which, at\nthat time, was one of the line running between New York and Newport,\nR. I. Forty-three years ago colored travelers were not permitted in the\ncabin, nor allowed abaft the paddle-wheels of a steam vessel. They were\ncompelled, whatever the weather might be,--whether cold or hot, wet or\ndry,--to spend the night on deck. Unjust as this regulation was, it\ndid not trouble us much; we had fared much harder before. We arrived at\nNewport the next morning, and soon after an old fashioned stage-coach,\nwith \"New Bedford\" in large yellow letters on its sides, came down to\nthe wharf. I had not money enough to pay our fare, and stood hesitating\nwhat to do. Fortunately for us, there were two Quaker gentlemen who were\nabout to take passage on the stage,--Friends William C. Taber and\nJoseph Ricketson,--who at once discerned our true situation, and, in a\npeculiarly quiet way, addressing me, Mr. Taber said: \"Thee get in.\" I\nnever obeyed an order with more alacrity, and we were soon on our way to\nour new home. When we reached \"Stone Bridge\" the passengers alighted\nfor breakfast, and paid their fares to the driver. We took no breakfast,\nand, when asked for our fares, I told the driver I would make it right\nwith him when we reached New Bedford. I expected some objection to this\non his part, but he made none. When, however, we reached New Bedford, he\ntook our baggage, including three music-books,--two of them collections\nby Dyer, and one by Shaw,--and held them until I was able to redeem them\nby paying to him the amount due for our rides. This was soon done, for\nMr. Nathan Johnson not only received me kindly and hospitably, but, on\nbeing informed about our baggage, at once loaned me the two dollars\nwith which to square accounts with the stage-driver. Mr. and Mrs. Nathan\nJohnson reached a good old age, and now rest from their labors. I am\nunder many grateful obligations to them. They not only \"took me in\nwhen a stranger\" and \"fed me when hungry,\" but taught me how to make an\nhonest living. Thus, in a fortnight after my flight from Maryland, I\nwas safe in New Bedford, a citizen of the grand old commonwealth of\nMassachusetts.\n\nOnce initiated into my new life of freedom and assured by Mr. Johnson\nthat I need not fear recapture in that city, a comparatively unimportant\nquestion arose as to the name by which I should be known thereafter in\nmy new relation as a free man. The name given me by my dear mother was\nno less pretentious and long than Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey.\nI had, however, while living in Maryland, dispensed with the Augustus\nWashington, and retained only Frederick Bailey. Between Baltimore and\nNew Bedford, the better to conceal myself from the slave-hunters, I had\nparted with Bailey and called myself Johnson; but in New Bedford I\nfound that the Johnson family was already so numerous as to cause some\nconfusion in distinguishing them, hence a change in this name seemed\ndesirable. Nathan Johnson, mine host, placed great emphasis upon\nthis necessity, and wished me to allow him to select a name for me. I\nconsented, and he called me by my present name--the one by which I have\nbeen known for three and forty years--Frederick Douglass. Mr. Johnson\nhad just been reading the \"Lady of the Lake,\" and so pleased was he with\nits great character that he wished me to bear his name. Since reading\nthat charming poem myself, I have often thought that, considering the\nnoble hospitality and manly character of Nathan Johnson--black man\nthough he was--he, far more than I, illustrated the virtues of the\nDouglas of Scotland. Sure am I that, if any slave-catcher had entered\nhis domicile with a view to my recapture, Johnson would have shown\nhimself like him of the \"stalwart hand.\"\n\nThe reader may be surprised at the impressions I had in some way\nconceived of the social and material condition of the people at the\nNorth. I had no proper idea of the wealth, refinement, enterprise, and\nhigh civilization of this section of the country. My \"Columbian Orator,\"\nalmost my only book, had done nothing to enlighten me concerning\nNorthern society. I had been taught that slavery was the bottom fact\nof all wealth. With this foundation idea, I came naturally to the\nconclusion that poverty must be the general condition of the people of\nthe free States. In the country from which I came, a white man holding\nno slaves was usually an ignorant and poverty-stricken man, and men\nof this class were contemptuously called \"poor white trash.\" Hence I\nsupposed that, since the non-slave-holders at the South were ignorant,\npoor, and degraded as a class, the non-slave-holders at the North must\nbe in a similar condition. I could have landed in no part of the\nUnited States where I should have found a more striking and gratifying\ncontrast, not only to life generally in the South, but in the condition\nof the colored people there, than in New Bedford. I was amazed when Mr.\nJohnson told me that there was nothing in the laws or constitution of\nMassachusetts that would prevent a colored man from being governor of\nthe State, if the people should see fit to elect him. There, too, the\nblack man's children attended the public schools with the white man's\nchildren, and apparently without objection from any quarter. To impress\nme with my security from recapture and return to slavery, Mr. Johnson\nassured me that no slave-holder could take a slave out of New Bedford;\nthat there were men there who would lay down their lives to save me from\nsuch a fate.\n\nThe fifth day after my arrival, I put on the clothes of a common\nlaborer, and went upon the wharves in search of work. On my way down\nUnion street I saw a large pile of coal in front of the house of Rev.\nEphraim Peabody, the Unitarian minister. I went to the kitchen door and\nasked the privilege of bringing in and putting away this coal. \"What\nwill you charge?\" said the lady. \"I will leave that to you, madam.\" \"You\nmay put it away,\" she said. I was not long in accomplishing the\njob, when the dear lady put into my hand TWO SILVER HALF-DOLLARS. To\nunderstand the emotion which swelled my heart as I clasped this money,\nrealizing that I had no master who could take it from me,--THAT IT WAS\nMINE--THAT MY HANDS WERE MY OWN, and could earn more of the precious\ncoin,--one must have been in some sense himself a slave. My next job was\nstowing a sloop at Uncle Gid. Howland's wharf with a cargo of oil for\nNew York. I was not only a freeman, but a free working-man, and no\n\"master\" stood ready at the end of the week to seize my hard earnings.\n\nThe season was growing late and work was plenty. Ships were being fitted\nout for whaling, and much wood was used in storing them. The sawing\nthis wood was considered a good job. With the help of old Friend Johnson\n(blessings on his memory) I got a saw and \"buck,\" and went at it. When\nI went into a store to buy a cord with which to brace up my saw in the\nframe, I asked for a \"fip's\" worth of cord. The man behind the counter\nlooked rather sharply at me, and said with equal sharpness, \"You don't\nbelong about here.\" I was alarmed, and thought I had betrayed myself.\nA fip in Maryland was six and a quarter cents, called fourpence in\nMassachusetts. But no harm came from the \"fi'penny-bit\" blunder, and I\nconfidently and cheerfully went to work with my saw and buck. It was new\nbusiness to me, but I never did better work, or more of it, in the same\nspace of time on the plantation for Covey, the negro-breaker, than I did\nfor myself in these earliest years of my freedom.\n\nNotwithstanding the just and humane sentiment of New Bedford three and\nforty years ago, the place was not entirely free from race and color\nprejudice. The good influence of the Roaches, Rodmans, Arnolds,\nGrinnells, and Robesons did not pervade all classes of its people. The\ntest of the real civilization of the community came when I applied for\nwork at my trade, and then my repulse was emphatic and decisive. It so\nhappened that Mr. Rodney French, a wealthy and enterprising citizen,\ndistinguished as an anti-slavery man, was fitting out a vessel for\na whaling voyage, upon which there was a heavy job of calking and\ncoppering to be done. I had some skill in both branches, and applied\nto Mr. French for work. He, generous man that he was, told me he would\nemploy me, and I might go at once to the vessel. I obeyed him, but upon\nreaching the float-stage, where others [sic] calkers were at work, I\nwas told that every white man would leave the ship, in her unfinished\ncondition, if I struck a blow at my trade upon her. This uncivil,\ninhuman, and selfish treatment was not so shocking and scandalous in\nmy eyes at the time as it now appears to me. Slavery had inured me to\nhardships that made ordinary trouble sit lightly upon me. Could I have\nworked at my trade I could have earned two dollars a day, but as a\ncommon laborer I received but one dollar. The difference was of great\nimportance to me, but if I could not get two dollars, I was glad to\nget one; and so I went to work for Mr. French as a common laborer. The\nconsciousness that I was free--no longer a slave--kept me cheerful under\nthis, and many similar proscriptions, which I was destined to meet\nin New Bedford and elsewhere on the free soil of Massachusetts. For\ninstance, though colored children attended the schools, and were treated\nkindly by their teachers, the New Bedford Lyceum refused, till several\nyears after my residence in that city, to allow any colored person to\nattend the lectures delivered in its hall. Not until such men as Charles\nSumner, Theodore Parker, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Horace Mann refused\nto lecture in their course while there was such a restriction, was it\nabandoned.\n\nBecoming satisfied that I could not rely on my trade in New Bedford to\ngive me a living, I prepared myself to do any kind of work that came to\nhand. I sawed wood, shoveled coal, dug cellars, moved rubbish from back\nyards, worked on the wharves, loaded and unloaded vessels, and scoured\ntheir cabins.\n\nI afterward got steady work at the brass-foundry owned by Mr. Richmond.\nMy duty here was to blow the bellows, swing the crane, and empty the\nflasks in which castings were made; and at times this was hot and heavy\nwork. The articles produced here were mostly for ship work, and in the\nbusy season the foundry was in operation night and day. I have often\nworked two nights and every working day of the week. My foreman, Mr.\nCobb, was a good man, and more than once protected me from abuse that\none or more of the hands was disposed to throw upon me. While in this\nsituation I had little time for mental improvement. Hard work, night and\nday, over a furnace hot enough to keep the metal running like water,\nwas more favorable to action than thought; yet here I often nailed a\nnewspaper to the post near my bellows, and read while I was performing\nthe up and down motion of the heavy beam by which the bellows was\ninflated and discharged. It was the pursuit of knowledge under\ndifficulties, and I look back to it now, after so many years, with some\ncomplacency and a little wonder that I could have been so earnest and\npersevering in any pursuit other than for my daily bread. I certainly\nsaw nothing in the conduct of those around to inspire me with such\ninterest: they were all devoted exclusively to what their hands found\nto do. I am glad to be able to say that, during my engagement in this\nfoundry, no complaint was ever made against me that I did not do my\nwork, and do it well. The bellows which I worked by main strength was,\nafter I left, moved by a steam-engine.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOOPHERED GRAPEVINE by Charles W. Chesnutt\n\n\nAbout ten years ago my wife was in poor health, and our family doctor,\nin whose skill and honesty I had implicit confidence, advised a change\nof climate. I was engaged in grape-culture in northern Ohio, and decided\nto look for a locality suitable for carrying on the same business\nin some Southern State. I wrote to a cousin who had gone into the\nturpentine business in central North Carolina, and he assured me that no\nbetter place could be found in the South than the State and neighborhood\nin which he lived: climate and soil were all that could be asked for,\nand land could be bought for a mere song. A cordial invitation to visit\nhim while I looked into the matter was accepted. We found the weather\ndelightful at that season, the end of the summer, and were most\nhospitably entertained. Our host placed a horse and buggy at our\ndisposal, and himself acted as guide until I got somewhat familiar with\nthe country.\n\nI went several times to look at a place which I thought might suit me.\nIt had been at one time a thriving plantation, but shiftless cultivation\nhad well-night exhausted the soil. There had been a vineyard of some\nextent on the place, but it had not been attended to since the war,\nand had fallen into utter neglect. The vines--here partly supported\nby decayed and broken-down arbors, there twining themselves among the\nbranches of the slender saplings which had sprung up among them--grew in\nwild and unpruned luxuriance, and the few scanty grapes which they bore\nwere the undisputed prey of the first comer. The site was admirably\nadapted to grape-raising; the soil, with a little attention, could not\nhave been better; and with the native grape, the luscious scuppernong,\nmainly to rely upon, I felt sure that I could introduce and cultivate\nsuccessfully a number of other varieties.\n\nOne day I went over with my wife, to show her the place. We drove\nbetween the decayed gate-posts--the gate itself had long since\ndisappeared--and up the straight, sandy lane to the open space where a\ndwelling-house had once stood. But the house had fallen a victim to the\nfortunes of war, and nothing remained of it except the brick pillars\nupon which the sills had rested. We alighted, and walked about the place\nfor a while; but on Annie's complaining of weariness I led the way back\nto the yard, where a pine log, lying under a spreading elm, formed a\nshady though somewhat hard seat. One end of the log was already occupied\nby a venerable-looking colored man. He held on his knees a hat full of\ngrapes, over which he was smacking his lips with great gusto, and a pile\nof grape-skins near him indicated that the performance was no new thing.\nHe respectfully rose as we approached, and was moving away, when I\nbegged him to keep his seat.\n\n\"Don't let us disturb you,\" I said. \"There's plenty of room for us all.\"\n\nHe resumed his seat with somewhat of embarrassment.\n\n\"Do you live around here?\" I asked, anxious to put him at his ease.\n\n\"Yas, suh. I lives des ober yander, behine de nex' san'-hill, on de\nLumberton plank-road.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything about the time when this vineyard was cultivated?\"\n\n\"Lawd bless yer, suh, I knows all about it. Dey ain' na'er a man in dis\nsettlement w'at won' tell yer ole Julius McAdoo 'uz bawn an' raise' on\ndis yer same plantation. Is you de Norv'n gemman w'at's gwine ter buy de\nole vimya'd?\"\n\n\"I am looking at it,\" I replied; \"but I don't know that I shall care to\nbuy unless I can be reasonably sure of making something out of it.\"\n\n\"Well, suh, you is a stranger ter me, en I is a stranger ter you, en we\nis bofe strangers ter one anudder, but 'f I 'uz in yo' place, I wouldn'\nbuy dis vimya'd.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, I dunner whe'r you b'lieves in cunj'in er not,--some er de w'ite\nfolks don't, er says dey don't,--but de truf er de matter is dat dis yer\nole vimya'd is goophered.\"\n\n\"Is what?\" I asked, not grasping the meaning of this unfamiliar word.\n\n\"Is goophered, cunju'd, bewitch'.\"\n\nHe imparted this information with such solemn earnestness, and with such\nan air of confidential mystery, that I felt somewhat interested, while\nAnnie was evidently much impressed, and drew closer to me.\n\n\"How do you know it is bewitched?\" I asked.\n\n\"I wouldn' spec' fer you ter b'lieve me 'less you know all 'bout de\nfac's. But ef you en young miss dere doan' min' lis'n'in' ter a ole\nnigger run on a minute er two w'ile you er restin', I kin 'splain to yer\nhow it all happen'.\"\n\nWe assured him that we would be glad to hear how it all happened, and\nhe began to tell us. At first the current of his memory--or\nimagination--seemed somewhat sluggish; but as his embarrassment wore\noff, his language flowed more freely, and the story acquired perspective\nand coherence. As he became more and more absorbed in the narrative,\nhis eyes assumed a dreamy expression, and he seemed to lose sight of his\nauditors, and to be living over again in monologue his life on the old\nplantation.\n\n\"Ole Mars Dugal' McAdoo bought dis place long many years befo' de wah,\nen I 'member well w'en he sot out all dis yer part er de plantation\nin scuppernon's. De vimes growed monst'us fas', en Mars Dugal' made a\nthousan' gallon er scuppernon' wine eve'y year.\n\n\"Now, ef dey's an'thing a nigger lub, nex' ter 'possum, en chick'n,\nen watermillyums, it's scuppernon's. Dey ain' nuffin dat kin stan' up\nside'n de scuppernon' fer sweetness; sugar ain't a suckumstance ter\nscuppernon'. W'en de season is nigh 'bout ober, en de grapes begin ter\nswivel up des a little wid de wrinkles er ole age,--w'en de skin git\nsof' en brown,--den de scuppernon' make you smack yo' lip en roll yo'\neye en wush fer mo'; so I reckon it ain' very 'stonishin' dat niggers\nlub scuppernon'.\n\n\"Dey wuz a sight er niggers in de naberhood er de vimya'd. Dere wuz ole\nMars Henry Brayboy's niggers, en ole Mars Dunkin McLean's niggers, en\nMars Dugal's own niggers; den dey wuz a settlement er free niggers\nen po' buckrahs down by de Wim'l'ton Road, en Mars Dugal' had de only\nvimya'd in de naberhood. I reckon it ain' so much so nowadays, but befo'\nde wah, in slab'ry times, er nigger didn' mine goin' fi' er ten mile in\na night, w'en dey wuz sump'n good ter eat at de yuther een.\n\n\"So atter a w'ile Mars Dugal' begin ter miss his scuppernon's. Co'se he\n'cuse' de niggers er it, but dey all 'nied it ter de las'. Mars Dugal'\nsot spring guns en steel traps, en he en de oberseah sot up nights\nonce't er twice't, tel one night Mars Dugal'--he 'uz a monst'us keerless\nman--got his leg shot full er cow-peas. But somehow er nudder dey\ncouldn' nebber ketch none er de niggers. I dunner how it happen, but it\nhappen des like I tell yer, en de grapes kep' on a-goin des de same.\n\n\"But bimeby ole Mars Dugal' fix' up a plan ter stop it. Dey 'uz a cunjuh\n'ooman livin' down mongs' de free niggers on de Wim'l'ton Road, en all\nde darkies fum Rockfish ter Beaver Crick wuz feared uv her. She could\nwuk de mos' powerfulles' kind er goopher,--could make people hab fits er\nrheumatiz, er make 'em des dwinel away en die; en dey say she went out\nridin' de niggers at night, for she wuz a witch 'sides bein' a cunjuh\n'ooman. Mars Dugal' hearn 'bout Aun' Peggy's doin's, en begun ter 'flect\nwhe'r er no he couldn' git her ter he'p him keep de niggers off'n de\ngrapevimes. One day in de spring er de year, ole miss pack' up a basket\ner chick'n en poun'-cake, en a bottle er scuppernon' wine, en Mars\nDugal' tuk it in his buggy en driv ober ter Aun' Peggy's cabin. He tuk\nde basket in, en had a long talk wid Aun' Peggy. De nex' day Aun' Peggy\ncome up ter de vimya'd. De niggers seed her slippin' 'roun', en dey soon\nfoun' out what she 'uz doin' dere. Mars Dugal' had hi'ed her ter goopher\nde grapevimes. She sa'ntered 'roun' mongs' de vimes, en tuk a leaf fum\ndis one, en a grape-hull fum dat one, en a grape-seed fum anudder one;\nen den a little twig fum here, en a little pinch er dirt fum dere,--en\nput it all in a big black bottle, wid a snake's toof en a speckle' hen's\ngall en some ha'rs fum a black cat's tail, en den fill' de bottle wid\nscuppernon' wine. W'en she got de goopher all ready en fix', she tuk 'n\nwent out in de woods en buried it under de root uv a red oak tree, en\nden come back en tole one er de niggers she done goopher de grapevimes,\nen a'er a nigger w'at eat dem grapes 'ud be sho ter die inside'n twel'\nmont's.\n\n\"Atter dat de niggers let de scuppernon's 'lone, en Mars Dugal' didn'\nhab no 'casion ter fine no mo' fault; en de season wuz mos' gone, w'en\na strange gemman stop at de plantation one night ter see Mars Dugal' on\nsome business; en his coachman, seein' de scuppernon's growin' so nice\nen sweet, slip 'roun' behine de smoke-house, en et all de scuppernon's\nhe could hole. Nobody didn' notice it at de time, but dat night, on de\nway home, de gemman's hoss runned away en kill' de coachman. W'en we\nhearn de noos, Aun' Lucy, de cook, she up 'n say she seed de strange\nnigger eat'n' er de scuppernon's behine de smoke-house; en den we knowed\nde goopher had b'en er wukkin. Den one er de nigger chilluns runned\naway fum de quarters one day, en got in de scuppernon's, en died de nex'\nweek. W'ite folks say he die' er de fevuh, but de niggers knowed it wuz\nde goopher. So you k'n be sho de darkies didn' hab much ter do wid dem\nscuppernon' vimes.\n\n\"W'en de scuppernon' season 'uz ober fer dat year, Mars Dugal' foun' he\nhad made fifteen hund'ed gallon er wine; en one er de niggers hearn\nhim laffin' wid de oberseah fit ter kill, en sayin' dem fifteen hund'ed\ngallon er wine wuz monst'us good intrus' on de ten dollars he laid\nout on de vimya'd. So I 'low ez he paid Aun' Peggy ten dollars fer to\ngoopher de grapevimes.\n\n\"De goopher didn' wuk no mo' tel de nex' summer, w'en 'long to'ds de\nmiddle er de season one er de fiel' han's died; en ez dat lef' Mars\nDugal' sho't er han's, he went off ter town fer ter buy anudder. He\nfotch de noo nigger home wid 'im. He wuz er ole nigger, er de color er\na gingy-cake, en ball ez a hoss-apple on de top er his head. He wuz a\npeart ole nigger, do', en could do a big day's wuk.\n\n\"Now it happen dat one er de niggers on de nex' plantation, one er ole\nMars Henry Brayboy's niggers, had runned away de day befo', en tuk ter\nde swamp, en ole Mars Dugal' en some er de yuther nabor w'ite folks had\ngone out wid dere guns en dere dogs fer ter he'p 'em hunt fer de nigger;\nen de han's on our own plantation wuz all so flusterated dat we fuhgot\nter tell de noo han' 'bout de goopher on de scuppernon' vimes. Co'se he\nsmell de grapes en see de vimes, an atter dahk de fus' thing he done\nwuz ter slip off ter de grapevimes 'dout sayin' nuffin ter nobody. Nex'\nmawnin' he tole some er de niggers 'bout de fine bait er scuppernon' he\net de night befo'.\n\n\"W'en dey tole 'im 'bout de goopher on de grapevimes, he 'uz dat\ntarrified dat he turn pale, en look des like he gwine ter die right in\nhis tracks. De oberseah come up en axed w'at 'uz de matter; en w'en dey\ntole 'im Henry be'n eatin' er de scuppernon's, en got de goopher on 'im,\nhe gin Henry a big drink er w'iskey, en 'low dat de nex' rainy day he\ntake 'im ober ter Aun' Peggy's, en see ef she wouldn' take de goopher\noff'n him, seein' ez he didn' know nuffin erbout it tel he done et de\ngrapes.\n\n\"Sho nuff, it rain de nex' day, en de oberseah went ober ter Aun'\nPeggy's wid Henry. En Aun' Peggy say dat bein' ez Henry didn' know 'bout\nde goopher, en et de grapes in ign'ance er de quinseconces, she reckon\nshe mought be able fer ter take de goopher off'n him. So she fotch out\ner bottle wid some cunjuh medicine in it, en po'd some out in a go'd fer\nHenry ter drink. He manage ter git it down; he say it tas'e like whiskey\nwid sump'n bitter in it. She 'lowed dat 'ud keep de goopher off'n him\ntel de spring; but w'en de sap begin ter rise in de grapevimes he ha'\nter come en see her agin, en she tell him w'at e's ter do.\n\n\"Nex' spring, w'en de sap commence' ter rise in de scuppernon' vime,\nHenry tuk a ham one night. Whar'd he git de ham? I doan know; dey wa'nt\nno hams on de plantation 'cep'n' w'at 'uz in de smoke-house, but I never\nsee Henry 'bout de smoke-house. But ez I wuz a-sayin', he tuk de ham\nober ter Aun' Peggy's; en Aun' Peggy tole 'im dat w'en Mars Dugal' begin\nter prume de grapevimes, he mus' go en take 'n scrape off de sap whar it\nooze out'n de cut een's er de vimes, en 'n'int his ball head wid it; en\nef he do dat once't a year de goopher wouldn' wuk agin 'im long ez he\ndone it. En bein' ez he fotch her de ham, she fix' it so he kin eat all\nde scuppernon' he want.\n\n\"So Henry 'n'int his head wid de sap out'n de big grapevime des ha'f way\n'twix' de quarters en de big house, en de goopher nebber wuk agin him\ndat summer. But de beatenes' thing you eber see happen ter Henry. Up\nter dat time he wuz ez ball ez a sweeten' 'tater, but des ez soon ez de\nyoung leaves begun ter come out on de grapevimes de ha'r begun ter grow\nout on Henry's head, en by de middle er de summer he had de bigges' head\ner ha'r on de plantation. Befo' dat, Henry had tol'able good ha'r 'roun\nde aidges, but soon ez de young grapes begun ter come Henry's ha'r begun\nter quirl all up in little balls, des like dis yer reg'lar grapy ha'r,\nen by de time de grapes got ripe his head look des like a bunch er\ngrapes. Combin' it didn' do no good; he wuk at it ha'f de night wid er\nJim Crow [1], en think he git it straighten' out, but in de mawnin' de\ngrapes 'ud be dere des de same. So he gin it up, en tried ter keep de\ngrapes down by havin' his ha'r cut sho't.\"\n\n[Footnote 1: A small card, resembling a curry-comb in construction, and\nused by negroes in the rural districts instead of a comb.]\n\n\"But dat wa'nt de quares' thing 'bout de goopher. When Henry come ter de\nplantation, he wuz gittin' a little ole an stiff in de j'ints. But\ndat summer he got des ez spry en libely ez any young nigger on de\nplantation; fac' he got so biggity dat Mars Jackson, de oberseah, ha'\nter th'eaten ter whip 'im, ef he didn' stop cuttin' up his didos en\nbehave hisse'f. But de mos' cur'ouses' thing happen' in de fall, when\nde sap begin ter go down in de grapevimes. Fus', when de grapes 'uz\ngethered, de knots begun ter straighten out'n Henry's h'ar; en w'en de\nleaves begin ter fall, Henry's ha'r begin ter drap out; en w'en de vimes\n'uz b'ar, Henry's head wuz baller 'n it wuz in de spring, en he begin\nter git ole en stiff in de j'ints ag'in, en paid no mo' tention ter de\ngals dyoin' er de whole winter. En nex' spring, w'en he rub de sap on\nag'in, he got young ag'in, en so soopl en libely dat none er de young\nniggers on de plantation couldn' jump, ner dance, ner hoe ez much cotton\nez Henry. But in de fall er de year his grapes begun ter straighten out,\nen his j'ints ter git stiff, en his ha'r drap off, en de rheumatiz begin\nter wrastle wid 'im.\n\n\"Now, ef you'd a knowed ole Mars Dugal' McAdoo, you'd a knowed dat\nit ha' ter be a mighty rainy day when he couldn' fine sump'n fer his\nniggers ter do, en it ha' ter be a mighty little hole he couldn' crawl\nthoo, en ha' ter be a monst'us cloudy night w'en a dollar git by him in\nde dahkness; en w'en he see how Henry git young in de spring en ole\nin de fall, he 'lowed ter hisse'f ez how he could make mo' money outen\nHenry dan by wukkin' him in de cotton fiel'. 'Long de nex' spring, atter\nde sap commence' ter rise, en Henry 'n'int 'is head en commence fer ter\ngit young en soopl, Mars Dugal' up 'n tuk Henry ter town, en sole 'im\nfer fifteen hunder' dollars.

He tuk\ngood keer uv 'im dyoin' er de winter,--give 'im w'iskey ter rub his\nrheumatiz, en terbacker ter smoke, en all he want ter eat,--'caze a\nnigger w'at he could make a thousan' dollars a year off'n didn' grow on\neve'y huckleberry bush.\n\n\"Nex' spring, w'en de sap ris en Henry's ha'r commence' ter sprout, Mars\nDugal' sole 'im ag'in, down in Robeson County dis time; en he kep' dat\nsellin' business up fer five year er mo'. Henry nebber say nuffin 'bout\nde goopher ter his noo marsters, 'caze he know he gwine ter be tuk good\nkeer uv de nex' winter, w'en Mars Dugal' buy him back. En Mars Dugal'\nmade 'nuff money off'n Henry ter buy anudder plantation ober on Beaver\nCrick.\n\n\"But long 'bout de een' er dat five year dey come a stranger ter stop\nat de plantation. De fus' day he 'uz dere he went out wid Mars Dugal' en\nspent all de mawnin' lookin' ober de vimya'd, en atter dinner dey spent\nall de evenin' playin' kya'ds. De niggers soon 'skiver' dat he wuz a\nYankee, en dat he come down ter Norf C'lina fer ter learn de w'ite folks\nhow to raise grapes en make wine. He promus Mars Dugal' he cud make de\ngrapevimes b'ar twice't ez many grapes, en dat de noo wine-press he wuz\na-sellin' would make mo' d'n twice't ez many gallons er wine. En ole\nMars Dugal' des drunk it all in, des 'peared ter be bewitched wit dat\nYankee. W'en de darkies see dat Yankee runnin' 'roun de vimya'd en\ndiggin' under de grapevimes, dey shuk dere heads, en 'lowed dat dey\nfeared Mars Dugal' losin' his min'. Mars Dugal' had all de dirt dug away\nfum under de roots er all de scuppernon' vimes, an' let 'em stan' dat\naway fer a week er mo'. Den dat Yankee made de niggers fix up a mixtry\ner lime en ashes en manyo, en po' it roun' de roots er de grapevimes.\nDen he 'vise' Mars Dugal' fer ter trim de vimes close't, en Mars Dugal'\ntuck 'n done eve'ything de Yankee tole him ter do. Dyoin' all er dis\ntime, mind yer, 'e wuz libbin' off'n de fat er de lan', at de big house,\nen playin' kyards wid Mars Dugal' eve'y night; en dey say Mars Dugal'\nlos' mo'n a thousan' dollars dyoin' er de week dat Yankee wuz a runnin'\nde grapevimes.\n\n\"W'en de sap ris nex' spring, ole Henry 'n'inted his head ez yuzhal,\nen his ha'r commence' ter grow des de same ez it done eve'y year. De\nscuppernon' vimes growed monst's fas', en de leaves wuz greener en\nthicker dan dey eber be'n dyowin my rememb'ance; en Henry's ha'r growed\nout thicker dan eber, en he 'peared ter git younger 'n younger, en\nsoopler 'n soopler; en seein' ez he wuz sho't er han's dat spring,\nhavin' tuk in consid'able noo groun', Mars Dugal' 'cluded he wouldn'\nsell Henry 'tel he git de crap in en de cotton chop'. So he kep' Henry\non de plantation.\n\n\"But 'long 'bout time fer de grapes ter come on de scuppernon' vimes,\ndey 'peared ter come a change ober dem; de leaves wivered en swivel' up,\nen de young grapes turn' yaller, en bimeby eve'ybody on de plantation\ncould see dat de whole vimya'd wuz dyin'. Mars Dugal' tuck 'n water de\nvimes en done all he could, but 't wan' no use: dat Yankee done bus' de\nwatermillyum. One time de vimes picked up a bit, en Mars Dugal' thought\ndey wuz gwine ter come out ag'in; but dat Yankee done dug too close\nunde' de roots, en prune de branches too close ter de vime, en all\ndat lime en ashes done burn' de life outen de vimes, en dey des kep' a\nwith'in' en a swivelin'.\n\n\"All dis time de goopher wuz a-wukkin'. W'en de vimes commence' ter\nwither, Henry commence' ter complain er his rheumatiz, en when de leaves\nbegin ter dry up his ha'r commence' ter drap out. When de vimes fresh up\na bit Henry 'ud git peart agin, en when de vimes wither agin Henry 'ud\ngit ole agin, en des kep' gittin' mo' en mo' fitten fer nuffin; he des\npined away, en fine'ly tuk ter his cabin; en when de big vime whar he\ngot de sap ter 'n'int his head withered en turned yaller en died, Henry\ndied too,--des went out sorter like a cannel. Dey didn't 'pear ter\nbe nuffin de matter wid 'im, 'cep'n de rheumatiz, but his strenk des\ndwinel' away 'tel he didn' hab ernuff lef' ter draw his bref. De goopher\nhad got de under holt, en th'owed Henry fer good en all dat time.\n\n\"Mars Dugal' tuk on might'ly 'bout losin' his vimes en his nigger in de\nsame year; en he swo' dat ef he could git hold er dat Yankee he'd wear\n'im ter a frazzle, en den chaw up de frazzle; en he'd done it, too, for\nMars Dugal' 'uz a monst'us brash man w'en he once git started. He sot de\nvimya'd out ober agin, but it wuz th'ee er fo' year befo' de vimes got\nter b'arin' any scuppernon's.\n\n\"W'en de wah broke out, Mars Dugal' raise' a comp'ny, en went off ter\nfight de Yankees. He saw he wuz mighty glad dat wah come, en he des want\nter kill a Yankee fer eve'y dollar he los' 'long er dat grape-raisin'\nYankee. En I 'spec' he would a done it, too, ef de Yankees hadn'\ns'picioned sump'n, en killed him fus'. Atter de s'render ole miss move'\nter town, de niggers all scattered 'way fum de plantation, en de vimya'd\nain' be'n cultervated sence.\"\n\n\"Is that story true?\" asked Annie, doubtfully, but seriously, as the old\nman concluded his narrative.\n\n\"It's des ez true ez I'm a-settin' here, miss. Dey's a easy way ter\nprove it: I kin lead de way right ter Henry's grave ober yander in de\nplantation buryin'-groun'. En I tell yer w'at, marster, I wouldn' 'vise\nyer to buy dis yer ole vimya'd, 'caze de goopher's on it yit, en dey\nain' no tellin' w'en it's gwine ter crap out.\"\n\n\"But I thought you said all the old vines died.\"\n\n\"Dey did 'pear ter die, but a few ov 'em come out ag'in, en is mixed in\nmongs' de yuthers. I ain' skeered ter eat de grapes, 'caze I knows de\nold vimes fum de noo ones; but wid strangers dey ain' no tellin' w'at\nmight happen. I wouldn' 'vise yer ter buy dis vimya'd.\"\n\nI bought the vineyard, nevertheless, and it has been for a long time\nin a thriving condition, and is referred to by the local press as a\nstriking illustration of the opportunities open to Northern capital in\nthe development of Southern industries. The luscious scuppernong holds\nfirst rank among our grapes, though we cultivate a great many other\nvarieties, and our income from grapes packed and shipped to the Northern\nmarkets is quite considerable. I have not noticed any developments of\nthe goopher in the vineyard, although I have a mild suspicion that our\ncolored assistants do not suffer from want of grapes during the season.\n\nI found, when I bought the vineyard, that Uncle Julius had occupied a\ncabin on the place for many years, and derived a respectable revenue\nfrom the neglected grapevines. This, doubtless, accounted for his advice\nto me not to buy the vineyard, though whether it inspired the goopher\nstory I am unable to state. I believe, however, that the wages I pay him\nfor his services are more than an equivalent for anything he lost by the\nsale of the vineyard.\n\n\n\n\nPO' SANDY by Charles W. Chesnutt\n\n\nOn the northeast corner of my vineyard in central North Carolina, and\nfronting on the Lumberton plank-road, there stood a small frame house,\nof the simplest construction. It was built of pine lumber, and contained\nbut one room, to which one window gave light and one door admission. Its\nweather-beaten sides revealed a virgin innocence of paint. Against one\nend of the house, and occupying half its width, there stood a huge brick\nchimney: the crumbling mortar had left large cracks between the bricks;\nthe bricks themselves had begun to scale off in large flakes, leaving\nthe chimney sprinkled with unsightly blotches. These evidences of decay\nwere but partially concealed by a creeping vine, which extended its\nslender branches hither and thither in an ambitious but futile attempt\nto cover the whole chimney. The wooden shutter, which had once protected\nthe unglazed window, had fallen from its hinges, and lay rotting in the\nrank grass and jimson-weeds beneath. This building, I learned when I\nbought the place, had been used as a school-house for several years\nprior to the breaking out of the war, since which time it had remained\nunoccupied, save when some stray cow or vagrant hog had sought shelter\nwithin its walls from the chill rains and nipping winds of winter.\n\nOne day my wife requested me to build her a new kitchen. The house\nerected by us, when we first came to live upon the vineyard, contained\na very conveniently arranged kitchen; but for some occult reason my wife\nwanted a kitchen in the back yard, apart from the dwelling-house, after\nthe usual Southern fashion. Of course I had to build it.\n\nTo save expense, I decided to tear down the old school-house, and\nuse the lumber, which was in a good state of preservation, in the\nconstruction of the new kitchen. Before demolishing the old house,\nhowever, I made an estimate of the amount of material contained in it,\nand found that I would have to buy several hundred feet of new lumber in\norder to build the new kitchen according to my wife's plan.\n\nOne morning old Julius McAdoo, our colored coachman, harnessed the gray\nmare to the rockaway, and drove my wife and me over to the saw-mill from\nwhich I meant to order the new lumber. We drove down the long lane which\nled from our house to the plank-road; following the plank-road for about\na mile, we turned into a road running through the forest and across the\nswamp to the sawmill beyond. Our carriage jolted over the half-rotted\ncorduroy road which traversed the swamp, and then climbed the long hill\nleading to the saw-mill. When we reached the mill, the foreman had gone\nover to a neighboring farm-house, probably to smoke or gossip, and\nwe were compelled to await his return before we could transact our\nbusiness. We remained seated in the carriage, a few rods from the mill,\nand watched the leisurely movements of the mill-hands. We had not waited\nlong before a huge pine log was placed in position, the machinery of\nthe mill was set in motion, and the circular saw began to eat its\nway through the log, with a loud whirr which resounded throughout the\nvicinity of the mill. The sound rose and fell in a sort of rhythmic\ncadence, which, heard from where we sat, was not unpleasing, and not\nloud enough to prevent conversation. When the saw started on its second\njourney through the log, Julius observed, in a lugubrious tone, and with\na perceptible shudder:--\n\n\"Ugh! but dat des do cuddle my blood!\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Uncle Julius?\" inquired my wife, who is of a very\nsympathetic turn of mind. \"Does the noise affect your nerves?\"\n\n\"No, Miss Annie,\" replied the old man, with emotion, \"I ain' narvous;\nbut dat saw, a-cuttin' en grindin' thoo dat stick er timber, en moanin',\nen groanin', en sweekin', kyars my 'memb'ance back ter ole times,\nen 'min's me er po' Sandy.\" The pathetic intonation with which he\nlengthened out the \"po' Sandy\" touched a responsive chord in our own\nhearts.\n\n\"And who was poor Sandy?\" asked my wife, who takes a deep interest in\nthe stories of plantation life which she hears from the lips of the\nolder colored people. Some of these stories are quaintly humorous;\nothers wildly extravagant, revealing the Oriental cast of the negro's\nimagination; while others, poured freely into the sympathetic ear of a\nNorthern-bred woman, disclose many a tragic incident of the darker side\nof slavery.\n\n\"Sandy,\" said Julius, in reply to my wife's question, \"was a nigger w'at\nuseter b'long ter ole Mars Marrabo McSwayne. Mars Marrabo's place wuz\non de yuther side'n de swamp, right nex' ter yo' place. Sandy wuz a\nmonst'us good nigger, en could do so many things erbout a plantation, en\nalluz 'ten ter his wuk so well, dat w'en Mars Marrabo's chilluns growed\nup en married off, dey all un 'em wanted dey daddy fer ter gin 'em\nSandy fer a weddin' present. But Mars Marrabo knowed de res' wouldn' be\nsatisfied ef he gin Sandy ter a'er one un 'em; so w'en dey wuz all done\nmarried, he fix it by 'lowin' one er his chilluns ter take Sandy fer a\nmont' er so, en den ernudder for a mont' er so, en so on dat erway tel\ndey had all had 'im de same lenk er time; en den dey would all take him\nroun' ag'in, 'cep'n oncet in a w'ile w'en Mars Marrabo would len' 'im\nter some er his yuther kinfolks 'roun' de country, w'en dey wuz short er\nhan's; tel bimeby it go so Sandy didn' hardly knowed whar he wuz gwine\nter stay fum one week's een ter de yuther.\n\n\"One time w'en Sandy wuz lent out ez yushal, a spekilater come erlong\nwid a lot er niggers, en Mars Marrabo swap' Sandy's wife off fer a noo\n'oman. W'en Sandy come back, Mars Marrabo gin 'im a dollar, en 'lowed he\nwuz monst'us sorry fer ter break up de fambly, but de spekilater had gin\n'im big boot, en times wuz hard en money skase, en so he wuz bleedst ter\nmake de trade. Sandy tuk on some 'bout losin' his wife, but he soon seed\ndey want no use cryin' ober spilt merlasses; en bein' ez he lacked de\nlooks er de noo 'ooman, he tuk up wid her atter she b'n on de plantation\na mont' er so.\n\n\"Sandy en his noo wife got on mighty well tergedder, en de niggers\nall 'mence' ter talk about how lovin' dey wuz. W'en Tenie wuz tuk sick\noncet, Sandy useter set up all night wid 'er, en den go ter wuk in\nde mawnin' des lack he had his reg'lar sleep; en Tenie would 'a done\nanythin' in de worl' for her Sandy.\n\n\"Sandy en Tenie hadn' b'en libbin' tergedder fer mo' d'n two mont's\nbefo' Mars Marrabo's old uncle, w'at libbed down in Robeson County, sent\nup ter fine out ef Mars Marrabo couldn' len' 'im er hire 'im a good han'\nfer a mont' er so. Sandy's marster wuz one er dese yer easy-gwine folks\nw'at wanter please eve'ybody, en he says yas, he could len' 'im Sandy.\nEn Mars Marrabo tole Sandy fer ter git ready ter go down ter Robeson\nnex' day, fer ter stay a mont' er so.\n\n\"Hit wuz monst'us hard on Sandy fer ter take 'im 'way fum Tenie. Hit wuz\nso fur down ter Robeson dat he didn' hab no chance er comin' back ter\nsee her tel de time wuz up; he wouldn' a' mine comin' ten er fifteen\nmile at night ter see Tenie, but Mars Marrabo's uncle's plantation wuz\nmo' d'n forty mile off. Sandy wuz mighty sad en cas' down atter w'at\nMars Marrabo tole 'im, en he says ter Tenie, sezee:--\n\n\"'I'm gittin monstus ti'ed er dish yer gwine roun' so much. Here I is\nlent ter Mars Jeems dis mont', en I got ter do so-en-so; en ter Mars\nArchie de nex' mont', en I got ter do so-en-so; den I got ter go ter\nMiss Jinnie's: en hit's Sandy dis en Sandy dat, en Sandy yer en Sandy\ndere, tel it 'pears ter me I ain' got no home, ner no marster, ner no\nmistiss, ner no nuffin'. I can't eben keep a wife: my yuther ole 'oman\nwuz sole away widout my gittin' a chance fer ter tell her good-by; en\nnow I got ter go off en leab you, Tenie, en I dunno whe'r I'm eber gwine\nter see yer ag'in er no. I wisht I wuz a tree, er a stump, er a rock, er\nsump'n w'at could stay on de plantation fer a w'ile.'\n\n\"Atter Sandy got thoo talkin', Tenie didn' say naer word, but des sot\ndere by de fier, studyin' en studyin'. Bimeby she up'n says:--\n\n\"'Sandy, is I eber tole you I wuz a cunjuh-'ooman?'\n\n\"Co'se Sandy hadn' nebber dremp' er nuffin lack dat, en he made a great\nmiration w'en he hear w'at Tenie say. Bimeby Tenie went on:--\n\n\"'I ain' goophered nobody, ner done no cunjuh-wuk fer fifteen yer er mo;\nen w'en I got religion I made up my mine I wouldn' wuk no mo' goopher.\nBut dey is some things I doan b'lieve it's no sin fer ter do; en ef you\ndoan wanter be sent roun' fum pillar ter pos', en ef you doan wanter go\ndown ter Robeson, I kin fix things so yer won't haf ter. Ef you'll des\nsay de word, I kin turn yer ter w'ateber yer wanter be, en yer kin stay\nright whar yer wanter, ez long ez yer mineter.'\n\n\"Sandy say he doan keer; he's willin' fer ter do anythin' fer ter stay\nclose ter Tenie. Den Tenie ax 'im ef he doan wanter be turnt inter a\nrabbit.\n\n\"Sandy say, 'No, de dogs mout git atter me.'\n\n\"'Shill I turn yer ter a wolf?' sez Tenie.\n\n\"'No, eve'ybody's skeered er a wolf, en I doan want nobody ter be\nskeered er me.'\n\n\"'Shill I turn yer ter a mawkin'-bird?'\n\n\"'No, a hawk mout ketch me. I wanter be turnt inter sump'n w'at'll stay\nin one place.'\n\n\"'I kin turn yer ter a tree,' sez Tenie. 'You won't hab no mouf ner\nyears, but I kin turn yer back oncet in a w'ile, so yer kin git sump'n\nter eat, en hear w'at's gwine on.'\n\n\"Well, Sandy say dat'll do. En so Tenie tuk 'im down by de aidge er de\nswamp, not fur fum de quarters, en turnt 'im inter a big pine-tree, en\nsot 'im out mongs' some yuther trees. En de nex' mawnin', ez some er de\nfiel' han's wuz gwine long dere, dey seed a tree w'at dey didn' 'member\ner habbin' seed befo; it wuz monst'us quare, en dey wuz bleedst ter\n'low dat dey hadn' 'membered right, er e'se one er de saplin's had be'n\ngrowin' monst'us fas'.\n\n\"W'en Mars Marrabo 'skiver' dat Sandy wuz gone, he 'lowed Sandy had\nrunned away. He got de dogs out, but de las' place dey could track Sandy\nter wuz de foot er dat pine-tree. En dere de dogs stood en barked, en\nbayed, en pawed at de tree, en tried ter climb up on it; en w'en dey wuz\ntuk roun' thoo de swamp ter look fer de scent, dey broke loose en made\nfer dat tree ag'in. It wuz de beatenis' thing de w'ite folks eber hearn\nof, en Mars Marrabo 'lowed dat Sandy must a' clim' up on de tree en\njump' off on a mule er sump'n, en rid fur 'nuff fer ter spile de scent.\nMars Marrabo wanted ter 'cuse some er de yuther niggers er heppin Sandy\noff, but dey all 'nied it ter de las'; en eve'ybody knowed Tenie sot too\nmuch by Sandy fer ter he'p 'im run away whar she couldn' nebber see 'im\nno mo'.\n\n\"W'en Sandy had be'n gone long 'nuff fer folks ter think he done got\nclean away, Tenie useter go down ter de woods at night en turn 'im back,\nen den dey'd slip up ter de cabin en set by de fire en talk. But dey ha'\nter be monst'us keerful, er e'se somebody would a seed 'em, en dat would\na spile de whole thing; so Tenie alluz turnt Sandy back in de mawnin'\nearly, befo' anybody wuz a'stirrin'.\n\n\"But Sandy didn' git erlong widout his trials en tribberlations. One day\na woodpecker come erlong en 'mence' ter peck at de tree; en de nex' time\nSandy wuz turnt back he had a little roun' hole in his arm, des lack a\nsharp stick be'n stuck in it. Atter dat Tenie sot a sparrer-hawk fer ter\nwatch de tree; en w'en de woodpecker come erlong nex' mawnin' fer ter\nfinish his nes', he got gobble' up mos' fo' he stuck his bill in de\nbark.\n\n\"Nudder time, Mars Marrabo sent a nigger out in de woods fer ter chop\ntuppentime boxes. De man chop a box in dish yer tree, en hack' de bark\nup two er th'ee feet, fer ter let de tuppentime run. De nex' time Sandy\nwuz turnt back he had a big skyar on his lef' leg, des lack it be'n\nskunt; en it tuk Tenie nigh 'bout all night fer ter fix a mixtry ter kyo\nit up. Atter dat, Tenie sot a hawnet fer ter watch de tree; en w'en de\nnigger come back ag'in fer ter cut ernudder box on de yuther side'n de\ntree, de hawnet stung 'im so hard dat de ax slip en cut his foot nigh\n'bout off.\n\n\"W'en Tenie see so many things happenin' ter de tree, she 'cluded she'd\nha' ter turn Sandy ter sump'n e'se; en atter studyin' de matter ober,\nen talkin' wid Sandy one ebenin', she made up her mine fer ter fix up a\ngoopher mixtry w'at would turn herse'f en Sandy ter foxes, er sump'n,\nso dey could run away en go some'rs whar dey could be free en lib lack\nw'ite folks.\n\n\"But dey ain' no tellin' w'at's gwine ter happen in dis worl'. Tenie had\ngot de night sot fer her en Sandy ter run away, w'en dat ve'y day one\ner Mars Marrabo's sons rid up ter de big house in his buggy, en say his\nwife wuz monst'us sick, en he want his mammy ter len' 'im a 'ooman fer\nter nuss his wife. Tenie's mistiss say sen Tenie; she wuz a good nuss.\nYoung mars wuz in a tarrible hurry fer ter git back home. Tenie wuz\nwashin' at de big house dat day, en her mistiss say she should go right\n'long wid her young marster. Tenie tried ter make some 'scuse fer ter\ngit away en hide tel night, w'en she would have eve'ything fix' up\nfer her en Sandy; she say she wanter go ter her cabin fer ter git\nher bonnet. Her mistiss say it doan matter 'bout de bonnet; her\nhead-hankcher wuz good 'nuff. Den Tenie say she wanter git her bes'\nfrock; her mistiss say no, she doan need no mo' frock, en w'en dat one\ngot dirty she could git a clean one whar she wuz gwine. So Tenie had ter\ngit in de buggy en go 'long wid young Mars Dunkin ter his plantation,\nw'ich wuz mo' d'n twenty mile away; en dey want no chance er her seein'\nSandy no mo' tel she come back home. De po' gal felt monst'us bad erbout\nde way things wuz gwine on, en she knowed Sandy mus' be a wond'rin' why\nshe didn' come en turn 'im back no mo'.\n\n\"W'iles Tenie wuz away nussin' young Mars Dunkin's wife, Mars Marrabo\ntuk a notion fer ter buil' 'im a noo kitchen; en bein' ez he had lots\ner timber on his place, he begun ter look 'roun' fer a tree ter hab de\nlumber sawed out'n. En I dunno how it come to be so, but he happen fer\nter hit on de ve'y tree w'at Sandy wuz turnt inter. Tenie wuz gone, en\ndey wa'n't nobody ner nuffin' fer ter watch de tree.\n\n\"De two men w'at cut de tree down say dey nebber had sech a time wid\na tree befo': dey axes would glansh off, en didn' 'pear ter make no\nprogress thoo de wood; en of all de creakin', en shakin', en wobblin'\nyou eber see, dat tree done it w'en it commence' ter fall. It wuz de\nbeatenis' thing!\n\n\"W'en dey got de tree all trim' up, dey chain it up ter a timber waggin,\nen start fer de saw-mill. But dey had a hard time gittin' de log dere:\nfus' dey got stuck in de mud w'en dey wuz gwine crosst de swamp, en\nit wuz two er th'ee hours befo' dey could git out. W'en dey start' on\nag'in, de chain kep' a-comin' loose, en dey had ter keep a-stoppin' en\na-stoppin' fer ter hitch de log up ag'in. W'en dey commence' ter climb\nde hill ter de saw-mill, de log broke loose, en roll down de hill en in\nmongs' de trees, en hit tuk nigh 'bout half a day mo' ter git it haul'\nup ter de saw-mill.\n\n\"De nex' mawnin' atter de day de tree wuz haul' ter de saw-mill, Tenie\ncome home. W'en she got back ter her cabin, de fus' thing she done wuz\nter run down ter de woods en see how Sandy wuz gittin' on. W'en she seed\nde stump standin' dere, wid de sap runnin' out'n it, en de limbs layin'\nscattered roun', she nigh 'bout went out'n her mine. She run ter her\ncabin, en got her goopher mixtry, en den foller de track er de timber\nwaggin ter de saw-mill. She knowed Sandy couldn' lib mo' d'n a minute er\nso ef she turn' him back, fer he wuz all chop' up so he'd a be'n bleedst\nter die. But she wanted ter turn 'im back long ernuff fer ter 'splain\nter 'im dat she hadn' went off a-purpose, en lef' 'im ter be chop' down\nen sawed up. She didn' want Sandy ter die wid no hard feelin's to'ds\nher.\n\n\"De han's at de saw-mill had des got de big log on de kerridge, en wuz\nstartin' up de saw, w'en dey seed a 'oman runnin up de hill, all out er\nbref, cryin' en gwine on des lack she wuz plumb 'stracted. It wuz Tenie;\nshe come right inter de mill, en th'owed herse'f on de log, right in\nfront er de saw, a-hollerin' en cryin' ter her Sandy ter fergib her,\nen not ter think hard er her, fer it wa'n't no fault er hern. Den Tenie\n'membered de tree didn' hab no years, en she wuz gittin' ready fer ter\nwuk her goopher mixtry so ez ter turn Sandy back, w'en de mill-hands\nkotch holt er her en tied her arms wid a rope, en fasten' her to one er\nde posts in de saw-mill; en den dey started de saw up ag'in, en cut de\nlog up inter bo'ds en scantlin's right befo' her eyes. But it wuz mighty\nhard wuk; fer of all de sweekin', en moanin', en groanin', dat log\ndone it w'iles de saw wuz a-cuttin' thoo it. De saw wuz one er dese yer\nole-timey, up-en-down saws, en hit tuk longer dem days ter saw a log\n'en it do now. Dey greased de saw, but dat didn' stop de fuss; hit kep'\nright on, tel finely dey got de log all sawed up.\n\n\"W'en de oberseah w'at run de saw-mill come fum brekfas', de han's up\nen tell him 'bout de crazy 'ooman--ez dey s'posed she wuz--w'at had\ncome runnin' in de saw-mill, a-hollerin' en gwine on, en tried ter th'ow\nherse'f befo' de saw. En de oberseah sent two er th'ee er de han's fer\nter take Tenie back ter her marster's plantation.\n\n\"Tenie 'peared ter be out'n her mine fer a long time, en her marster\nha' ter lock her up in de smoke-'ouse tel she got ober her spells. Mars\nMarrabo wuz monst'us mad, en hit would a made yo' flesh crawl fer ter\nhear him cuss, caze he say de spekilater w'at he got Tenie fum had\nfooled 'im by wukkin' a crazy 'oman off on him. Wiles Tenie wuz lock up\nin de smoke-'ouse, Mars Marrabo tuk'n' haul de lumber fum de saw-mill,\nen put up his noo kitchen.\n\n\"W'en Tenie got quiet' down, so she could be 'lowed ter go 'roun' de\nplantation, she up'n tole her marster all erbout Sandy en de pine-tree;\nen w'en Mars Marrabo hearn it, he 'lowed she wuz de wuss 'stracted\nnigger he eber hearn of. He didn' know w'at ter do wid Tenie: fus' he\nthought he'd put her in de po'-house; but finely, seein' ez she didn' do\nno harm ter nobody ner nuffin', but des went roun' moanin', en groanin',\nen shakin' her head, he 'cluded ter let her stay on de plantation\nen nuss de little nigger chilluns w'en dey mammies wuz ter wuk in de\ncotton-fiel'.\n\n\"De noo kitchen Mars Marrabo buil' wuzn' much use, fer it hadn' be'n put\nup long befo' de niggers 'mence' ter notice quare things erbout it. Dey\ncould hear sump'n moanin' en groanin' 'bout de kitchen in de night-time,\nen w'en de win' would blow dey could hear sump'n a-hollerin' en sweekin'\nlack hit wuz in great pain en sufferin'. En hit got so atter a w'ile dat\nhit wuz all Mars Marrabo's wife could do ter git a 'ooman ter stay in de\nkitchen in de daytime long ernuff ter do de cookin'; en dey wa'n't naer\nnigger on de plantation w'at wouldn' rudder take forty dan ter go 'bout\ndat kitchen atter dark,--dat is, 'cep'n Tenie; she didn' pear ter mine\nde ha'nts. She useter slip 'roun' at night, en set on de kitchen steps,\nen lean up agin de do'-jamb, en run on ter herse'f wid some kine er\nfoolishness w'at nobody couldn' make out; fer Mars Marrabo had th'eaten'\nter sen' her off'n de plantation ef she say anything ter any er de\nyuther niggers 'bout de pine-tree. But somehow er nudder de niggers\nfoun' out all 'bout it, en dey knowed de kitchen wuz ha'anted by Sandy's\nsperrit. En bimeby hit got so Mars Marrabo's wife herse'f wuz skeered\nter go out in de yard atter dark.\n\n\"W'en it come ter dat, Mars Marrabo tuk 'n' to' de kitchen down, en use'\nde lumber fer ter buil' dat ole school-'ouse w'at youer talkin' 'bout\npullin' down. De school-'ouse wuzn' use' 'cep'n' in de daytime, en on\ndark nights folks gwine 'long de road would hear quare soun's en see\nquare things. Po' ole Tenie useter go down dere at night, en wander\n'roun' de school-'ouse; en de niggers all 'lowed she went fer ter talk\nwid Sandy's sperrit. En one winter mawnin', w'en one er de boys went\nter school early fer ter start de fire, w'at should he fine but po' ole\nTenie, layin' on de flo', stiff, en cole, en dead. Dere didn' 'pear ter\nbe nuffin' pertickler de matter wid her,--she had des grieve' herse'f\nter def fer her Sandy. Mars Marrabo didn' shed no tears. He thought\nTenie wuz crazy, en dey wa'n't no tellin' w'at she mout do nex'; en dey\nain' much room in dis worl' fer crazy w'ite folks, let 'lone a crazy\nnigger.\n\n\"Hit wa'n't long atter dat befo' Mars Marrabo sole a piece er his track\ner lan' ter Mars Dugal' McAdoo,--MY ole marster,--en dat's how de ole\nschool-house happen to be on yo' place. W'en de wah broke out, de school\nstop', en de ole school-'ouse be'n stannin' empty ever sence,--dat is,\n'cep'n' fer de ha'nts. En folks sez dat de ole school-'ouse, er any\nyuther house w'at got any er dat lumber in it w'at wuz sawed out'n de\ntree w'at Sandy wuz turnt inter, is gwine ter be ha'nted tel de las'\npiece er plank is rotted en crumble' inter dus'.\"\n\nAnnie had listened to this gruesome narrative with strained attention.\n\n\"What a system it was,\" she exclaimed, when Julius had finished, \"under\nwhich such things were possible!\"\n\n\"What things?\" I asked, in amazement. \"Are you seriously considering the\npossibility of a man's being turned into a tree?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she replied quickly, \"not that;\" and then she added absently,\nand with a dim look in her fine eyes, \"Poor Tenie!\"\n\nWe ordered the lumber, and returned home. That night, after we had gone\nto bed, and my wife had to all appearances been sound asleep for half an\nhour, she startled me out of an incipient doze by exclaiming suddenly,--\n\n\"John, I don't believe I want my new kitchen built out of the lumber in\nthat old school-house.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't for a moment allow yourself,\" I replied, with some\nasperity, \"to be influenced by that absurdly impossible yarn which\nJulius was spinning to-day?\"\n\n\"I know the story is absurd,\" she replied dreamily, \"and I am not so\nsilly as to believe it. But I don't think I should ever be able to\ntake any pleasure in that kitchen if it were built out of that lumber.\nBesides, I think the kitchen would look better and last longer if the\nlumber were all new.\"\n\nOf course she had her way. I bought the new lumber, though not without\ngrumbling. A week or two later I was called away from home on business.\nOn my return, after an absence of several days, my wife remarked to\nme,--\n\n\"John, there has been a split in the Sandy Run Colored Baptist Church,\non the temperance question. About half the members have come out from\nthe main body, and set up for themselves. Uncle Julius is one of the\nseceders, and he came to me yesterday and asked if they might not hold\ntheir meetings in the old school-house for the present.\"\n\n\"I hope you didn't let the old rascal have it,\" I returned, with some\nwarmth. I had just received a bill for the new lumber I had bought.\n\n\"Well,\" she replied, \"I could not refuse him the use of the house for so\ngood a purpose.\"\n\n\"And I'll venture to say,\" I continued, \"that you subscribed something\ntoward the support of the new church?\"\n\nShe did not attempt to deny it.\n\n\"What are they going to do about the ghost?\" I asked, somewhat curious\nto know how Julius would get around this obstacle.\n\n\"Oh,\" replied Annie, \"Uncle Julius says that ghosts never disturb\nreligious worship, but that if Sandy's spirit SHOULD happen to stray\ninto meeting by mistake, no doubt the preaching would do it good.\"\n\n\n\n\nDAVE'S NECKLISS by Charles W. Chesnutt\n\n\n\"Have some dinner, Uncle Julius?\" said my wife.\n\nIt was a Sunday afternoon in early autumn. Our two women-servants had\ngone to a camp-meeting some miles away, and would not return until\nevening. My wife had served the dinner, and we were just rising from\nthe table, when Julius came up the lane, and, taking off his hat, seated\nhimself on the piazza.\n\nThe old man glanced through the open door at the dinner-table, and his\neyes rested lovingly upon a large sugar-cured ham, from which several\nslices had been cut, exposing a rich pink expanse that would have\nappealed strongly to the appetite of any hungry Christian.\n\n\"Thanky, Miss Annie,\" he said, after a momentary hesitation, \"I dunno ez\nI keers ef I does tas'e a piece er dat ham, ef yer'll cut me off a slice\nun it.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Annie, \"I won't. Just sit down to the table and help\nyourself; eat all you want, and don't be bashful.\"\n\nJulius drew a chair up to the table, while my wife and I went out on\nthe piazza. Julius was in my employment; he took his meals with his own\nfamily, but when he happened to be about our house at meal-times, my\nwife never let him go away hungry.\n\nI threw myself into a hammock, from which I could see Julius through an\nopen window. He ate with evident relish, devoting his attention chiefly\nto the ham, slice after slice of which disappeared in the spacious\ncavity of his mouth. At first the old man ate rapidly, but after the\nedge of his appetite had been taken off he proceeded in a more leisurely\nmanner. When he had cut the sixth slice of ham (I kept count of them\nfrom a lazy curiosity to see how much he COULD eat) I saw him lay it\non his plate; as he adjusted the knife and fork to cut it into smaller\npieces, he paused, as if struck by a sudden thought, and a tear rolled\ndown his rugged cheek and fell upon the slice of ham before him. But the\nemotion, whatever the thought that caused it, was transitory, and in a\nmoment he continued his dinner. When he was through eating, he came\nout on the porch, and resumed his seat with the satisfied expression of\ncountenance that usually follows a good dinner.\n\n\"Julius,\" I said, \"you seemed to be affected by something, a moment ago.\nWas the mustard so strong that it moved you to tears?\"\n\n\"No, suh, it wa'n't de mustard; I wuz studyin' 'bout Dave.\"\n\n\"Who was Dave, and what about him?\" I asked.\n\nThe conditions were all favorable to story-telling. There was an\nautumnal languor in the air, and a dreamy haze softened the dark green\nof the distant pines and the deep blue of the Southern sky. The generous\nmeal he had made had put the old man in a very good humor. He was not\nalways so, for his curiously undeveloped nature was subject to moods\nwhich were almost childish in their variableness. It was only now and\nthen that we were able to study, through the medium of his recollection,\nthe simple but intensely human inner life of slavery. His way of looking\nat the past seemed very strange to us; his view of certain sides of life\nwas essentially different from ours. He never indulged in any regrets\nfor the Arcadian joyousness and irresponsibility which was a somewhat\npopular conception of slavery; his had not been the lot of the petted\nhouse-servant, but that of the toiling field-hand. While he mentioned\nwith a warm appreciation the acts of kindness which those in authority\nhad shown to him and his people, he would speak of a cruel deed, not\nwith the indignation of one accustomed to quick feeling and spontaneous\nexpression, but with a furtive disapproval which suggested to us a doubt\nin his own mind as to whether he had a right to think or to feel, and\npresented to us the curious psychological spectacle of a mind enslaved\nlong after the shackles had been struck off from the limbs of its\npossessor. Whether the sacred name of liberty ever set his soul aglow\nwith a generous fire; whether he had more than the most elementary ideas\nof love, friendship, patriotism, religion,--things which are half, and\nthe better half, of life to us; whether he even realized, except in a\nvague, uncertain way, his own degradation, I do not know. I fear not;\nand if not, then centuries of repression had borne their legitimate\nfruit. But in the simple human feeling, and still more in the undertone\nof sadness, which pervaded his stories, I thought I could see a spark\nwhich, fanned by favoring breezes and fed by the memories of the past,\nmight become in his children's children a glowing flame of sensibility,\nalive to every thrill of human happiness or human woe.\n\n\"Dave use' ter b'long ter my ole marster,\" said Julius; \"he wuz raise'\non dis yer plantation, en I kin 'member all erbout 'im, fer I wuz ole\n'nuff ter chop cotton w'en it all happen'. Dave wuz a tall man, en\nmonst'us strong: he could do mo' wuk in a day dan any yuther two niggers\non de plantation. He wuz one er dese yer solemn kine er men, en nebber\nrun on wid much foolishness, like de yuther darkies. He use' ter go out\nin de woods en pray; en w'en he hear de han's on de plantation cussin'\nen gwine on wid dere dancin' en foolishness, he use' ter tell 'em 'bout\nreligion en jedgmen'-day, w'en dey would haf ter gin account fer eve'y\nidle word en all dey yuther sinful kyarin's-on.\n\n\"Dave had l'arn' how ter read de Bible. Dey wuz a free nigger boy in\nde settlement w'at wuz monst'us smart, en could write en cipher, en wuz\nalluz readin' books er papers. En Dave had hi'ed dis free boy fer ter\nl'arn 'im how ter read. Hit wuz 'g'in de law, but co'se none er de\nniggers didn' say nuffin ter de w'ite folks 'bout it. Howsomedever, one\nday Mars Walker--he wuz de oberseah--foun' out Dave could read. Mars\nWalker wa'n't nuffin but a po' bockrah, en folks said he couldn' read\nner write hisse'f, en co'se he didn' lack ter see a nigger w'at knowed\nmo' d'n he did; so he went en tole Mars Dugal'. Mars Dugal' sont fer\nDave, en ax' 'im 'bout it.\n\n\"Dave didn't hardly knowed w'at ter do; but he couldn' tell no lie, so\nhe 'fessed he could read de Bible a little by spellin' out de words.\nMars Dugal' look' mighty solemn.\n\n\"'Dis yer is a se'ious matter,' sezee; 'it's 'g'in de law ter l'arn\nniggers how ter read, er 'low 'em ter hab books. But w'at yer l'arn\nout'n dat Bible, Dave?'\n\n\"Dave wa'n't no fool, ef he wuz a nigger, en sezee:--\n\n\"'Marster, I l'arns dat it's a sin fer ter steal, er ter lie, er fer ter\nwant w'at doan b'long ter yer; en I l'arns fer ter love de Lawd en ter\n'bey my marster.'\n\n\"Mars Dugal' sorter smile' en laf' ter hisse'f, like he 'uz might'ly\ntickle' 'bout sump'n, en sezee:--\n\n\"'Doan 'pear ter me lack readin' de Bible done yer much harm, Dave.\nDat's w'at I wants all my niggers fer ter know. Yer keep right on\nreadin', en tell de yuther han's w'at yer be'n tellin' me. How would yer\nlack fer ter preach ter de niggers on Sunday?'\n\n\"Dave say he'd be glad fer ter do w'at he could. So Mars Dugal' tole de\noberseah fer ter let Dave preach ter de niggers, en tell 'em w'at wuz in\nde Bible, en it would he'p ter keep 'em fum stealin' er runnin' erway.\n\n\"So Dave 'mence' ter preach, en done de han's on de plantation a heap er\ngood, en most un 'em lef' off dey wicked ways, en 'mence' ter love ter\nhear 'bout God, en religion, en de Bible; en dey done dey wuk better, en\ndidn' gib de oberseah but mighty little trouble fer ter manage 'em.\n\n\"Dave wuz one er dese yer men w'at didn' keer much fer de\ngals,--leastways he didn' tel Dilsey come ter de plantation. Dilsey wuz\na monst'us peart, good-lookin', gingybread-colored gal,--one er dese yer\nhigh-steppin' gals w'at hol's dey heads up, en won' stan' no foolishness\nfum no man. She had b'long' ter a gemman over on Rockfish, w'at died, en\nwhose 'state ha' ter be sol' fer ter pay his debts. En Mars Dugal' had\nb'en ter de oction, en w'en he seed dis gal a-cryin' en gwine on 'bout\nbein' sol' erway fum her ole mammy, Aun' Mahaly, Mars Dugal' bid 'em\nbofe in, en fotch 'em ober ter our plantation.\n\n\"De young nigger men on de plantation wuz des wil' atter Dilsey, but it\ndidn' do no good, en none un 'em couldn' git Dilsey fer dey junesey,[2]\n'tel Dave 'mence' fer ter go roun' Aun' Mahaly's cabin. Dey wuz a\nfine-lookin' couple, Dave en Dilsey wuz, bofe tall, en well-shape',\nen soopl'. En dey sot a heap by one ernudder. Mars Dugal' seed 'em\ntergedder one Sunday, en de nex' time he seed Dave atter dat, sezee:--\n\n\"Dave, w'en yer en Dilsey gits ready fer ter git married, I ain' got no\nrejections. Dey's a poun' er so er chawin'-terbacker up at de house, en\nI reckon yo' mist'iss kin fine a frock en a ribbin er two fer Dilsey.\nYouer bofe good niggers, en yer neenter be feared er bein' sol' 'way fum\none ernudder long ez I owns dis plantation; en I 'spec's ter own it fer\na long time yit.'\"\n\n[Footnote 2: Sweetheart.]\n\n\"But dere wuz one man on de plantation w'at didn' lack ter see Dave en\nDilsey tergedder ez much ez ole marster did. W'en Mars Dugal' went ter\nde sale whar he got Dilsey en Mahaly, he bought ernudder han', by de\nname er Wiley. Wiley wuz one er dese yer shiny-eyed, double-headed\nlittle niggers, sha'p ez a steel trap, en sly ez de fox w'at keep\nout'n it. Dis yer Wiley had be'n pesterin' Dilsey 'fo' she come ter our\nplantation, en had nigh 'bout worried de life out'n her. She didn' keer\nnuffin fer 'im, but he pestered her so she ha' ter th'eaten ter tell her\nmarster fer ter make Wiley let her 'lone. W'en he come ober to our\nplace it wuz des ez bad, 'tel bimeby Wiley seed dat Dilsey had got ter\nthinkin' a heap 'bout Dave, en den he sorter hilt off aw'ile, en purten'\nlack he gin Dilsey up. But he wuz one er dese yer 'ceitful niggers, en\nw'ile he wuz laffin' en jokin' wid de yuther han's 'bout Dave en Dilsey,\nhe wuz settin' a trap fer ter ketch Dave en git Dilsey back fer hisse'f.\n\n\"Dave en Dilsey made up dere min's fer ter git married long 'bout\nChristmas time, w'en dey'd hab mo' time fer a weddin'. But 'long 'bout\ntwo weeks befo' dat time ole mars 'mence' ter lose a heap er bacon.\nEve'y night er so somebody 'ud steal a side er bacon, er a ham, er a\nshoulder, er sump'n, fum one er de smoke-'ouses. De smoke-'ouses\nwuz lock', but somebody had a key, en manage' ter git in some way er\n'nudder. Dey's mo' ways 'n one ter skin a cat, en dey's mo' d'n one way\nter git in a smoke-'ouse,--leastways dat's w'at I hearn say. Folks w'at\nhad bacon fer ter sell didn' hab no trouble 'bout gittin' rid un it. Hit\nwuz 'g'in' de law fer ter buy things fum slabes; but Lawd! dat law didn'\n'mount ter a hill er peas. Eve'y week er so one er dese yer big covered\nwaggins would come 'long de road, peddlin' terbacker en w'iskey. Dey wuz\na sight er room in one er dem big waggins, en it wuz monst'us easy\nfer ter swop off bacon fer sump'n ter chaw er ter wa'm yer up in de\nwinter-time. I s'pose de peddlers didn' knowed dey wuz breakin' de law,\ncaze de niggers alluz went at night, en stayed on de dark side er de\nwaggin; en it wuz mighty hard fer ter tell W'AT kine er folks dey wuz.\n\n\"Atter two er th'ee hund'ed er meat had be'n stole', Mars Walker call\nall de niggers up one ebenin', en tol' 'em dat de fus' nigger he cot\nstealin' bacon on dat plantation would git sump'n fer ter 'member it\nby long ez he lib'. En he say he'd gin fi' dollars ter de nigger\nw'at 'skiver' de rogue. Mars Walker say he s'picion' one er two er de\nniggers, but he couldn' tell fer sho, en co'se dey all 'nied it w'en he\n'cuse em un it.\n\n\"Dey wa'n't no bacon stole' fer a week er so, 'tel one dark night w'en\nsomebody tuk a ham fum one er de smoke-'ouses. Mars Walker des cusst\nawful w'en he foun' out de ham wuz gone, en say he gwine ter sarch all\nde niggers' cabins; w'en dis yer Wiley I wuz tellin' yer 'bout up'n\nsay he s'picion' who tuk de ham, fer he seed Dave comin' 'cross de\nplantation fum to'ds de smoke-'ouse de night befo'. W'en Mars Walker\nhearn dis fum Wiley, he went en sarch' Dave's cabin, en foun' de ham hid\nunder de flo'.\n\n\"Eve'ybody wuz 'stonish'; but dere wuz de ham. Co'se Dave 'nied it ter\nde las', but dere wuz de ham. Mars Walker say it wuz des ez he 'spected:\nhe didn' b'lieve in dese yer readin' en prayin' niggers; it wuz all\n'pocrisy, en sarve' Mars Dugal' right fer 'lowin' Dave ter be readin'\nbooks w'en it wuz 'g'in de law.\n\n\"W'en Mars Dugal' hearn 'bout de ham, he say he wuz might'ly 'ceived en\ndisapp'inted in Dave. He say he wouldn' nebber hab no mo' conferdence in\nno nigger, en Mars Walker could do des ez he wuz a mineter wid Dave er\nany er de res' er de niggers. So Mars Walker tuk'n tied Dave up en gin\n'im forty; en den he got some er dis yer wire clof w'at dey uses fer\nter make sifters out'n, en tuk'n wrap' it roun' de ham en fasten it\ntergedder at de little een'. Den he tuk Dave down ter de blacksmif-shop,\nen had Unker Silas, de plantation black-smif, fasten a chain ter de ham,\nen den fasten de yuther een' er de chain roun' Dave's neck. En den he\nsays ter Dave, sezee:--\n\n\"'Now, suh, yer'll wear dat neckliss fer de nex' six mont's; en I\n'spec's yer ner none er de yuther niggers on dis plantation won' steal\nno mo' bacon dyoin' er dat time.'\n\n\"Well, it des 'peared ez if fum dat time Dave didn' hab nuffin but\ntrouble. De niggers all turnt ag'in' 'im, caze he be'n de 'casion er\nMars Dugal' turnin' 'em all ober ter Mars Walker. Mars Dugal' wa'n't a\nbad marster hisse'f, but Mars Walker wuz hard ez a rock. Dave kep' on\nsayin' he didn' take de ham, but none un 'em didn' b'lieve 'im.\n\n\"Dilsey wa'n't on de plantation w'en Dave wuz 'cused er stealin' de\nbacon. Ole mist'iss had sont her ter town fer a week er so fer ter\nwait on one er her darters w'at had a young baby, en she didn' fine out\nnuffin 'bout Dave's trouble 'tel she got back ter de plantation. Dave\nhad patien'ly endyoed de finger er scawn, en all de hard words w'at de\nniggers pile' on 'im, caze he wuz sho' Dilsey would stan' by 'im, en\nwouldn' b'lieve he wuz a rogue, ner none er de yuther tales de darkies\nwuz tellin' 'bout 'im.\n\n\"W'en Dilsey come back fum town, en got down fum behine de buggy whar\nshe be'n ridin' wid ole mars, de fus' nigger 'ooman she met says ter\nher,--\n\n\"'Is yer seed Dave, Dilsey?'\n\n\"No, I ain' seed Dave,' says Dilsey.\n\n\"'Yer des oughter look at dat nigger; reckon yer wouldn' want 'im fer\nyo' junesey no mo'. Mars Walker cotch 'im stealin' bacon, en gone en\nfasten' a ham roun' his neck, so he can't git it off'n hisse'f. He\nsut'nly do look quare.' En den de 'ooman bus' out laffin' fit ter kill\nherse'f. W'en she got thoo laffin' she up'n tole Dilsey all 'bout de\nham, en all de yuther lies w'at de niggers be'n tellin' on Dave.\n\n\"W'en Dilsey started down ter de quarters, who should she meet but\nDave, comin' in fum de cotton-fiel'. She turnt her head ter one side, en\npurten' lack she didn' seed Dave.\n\n\"'Dilsey!' sezee.\n\n\"Dilsey walk' right on, en didn' notice 'im.\n\n\"'OH, Dilsey!'\n\n\"Dilsey didn' paid no 'tention ter 'im, en den Dave knowed some er de\nniggers be'n tellin' her 'bout de ham. He felt monst'us bad, but he\n'lowed ef he could des git Dilsey fer ter listen ter 'im fer a minute er\nso, he could make her b'lieve he didn' stole de bacon. It wuz a week er\ntwo befo' he could git a chance ter speak ter her ag'in; but fine'ly he\ncotch her down by de spring one day, en sezee:--\n\n\"'Dilsey, w'at fer yer won' speak ter me, en purten' lack yer doan see\nme? Dilsey, yer knows me too well fer ter b'lieve I'd steal, er do dis\nyuther wick'ness de niggers is all layin' ter me,--yer KNOWS I wouldn'\ndo dat, Dilsey. Yer ain' gwine back on yo' Dave, is yer?'\n\n\"But w'at Dave say didn' hab no 'fec' on Dilsey. Dem lies folks b'en\ntellin' her had p'isen' her min' 'g'in' Dave.\n\n\"'I doan wanter talk ter no nigger,' says she, 'w'at be'n whip' fer\nstealin', en w'at gwine roun' wid sich a lookin' thing ez dat hung roun'\nhis neck. I's a 'spectable gal, I is. W'at yer call dat, Dave? Is dat\na cha'm fer ter keep off witches, er is it a noo kine er neckliss yer\ngot?'\n\n\"Po' Dave didn' knowed w'at ter do. De las' one he had 'pended on fer\nter stan' by 'im had gone back on 'im, en dey didn' 'pear ter be nuffin\nmo' wuf libbin' fer. He couldn' hol' no mo' pra'r-meetin's, fer Mars\nWalker wouldn' 'low 'im ter preach, en de darkies wouldn' 'a' listen'\nter 'im ef he had preach'. He didn' eben hab his Bible fer ter comfort\nhisse'f wid, fer Mars Walker had tuk it erway fum 'im en burnt it up, en\nsay ef he ketch any mo' niggers wid Bibles on de plantation he'd do 'em\nwuss'n he done Dave.\n\n\"En ter make it still harder fer Dave, Dilsey tuk up wid Wiley. Dave\ncould see him gwine up ter Aun' Mahaly's cabin, en settin' out on de\nbench in de moonlight wid Dilsey, en singin' sinful songs en playin' de\nbanjer. Dave use' ter scrouch down behine de bushes, en wonder w'at de\nLawd sen' 'im all dem tribberlations fer.\n\n\"But all er Dave's yuther troubles wa'n't nuffin side er dat ham. He had\nwrap' de chain roun' wid a rag, so it didn' hurt his neck; but w'eneber\nhe went ter wuk, dat ham would be in his way; he had ter do his task,\nhowsomedever, des de same ez ef he didn' hab de ham. W'eneber he went\nter lay down, dat ham would be in de way. Ef he turn ober in his sleep,\ndat ham would be tuggin' at his neck. It wuz de las' thing he seed\nat night, en de fus' thing he seed in de mawnin'. W'eneber he met a\nstranger, de ham would be de fus' thing de stranger would see. Most\nun 'em would 'mence' ter laf, en whareber Dave went he could see folks\np'intin' at him, en year 'em sayin:--\n\n\"'W'at kine er collar dat nigger got roun' his neck?' er, ef dey knowed\n'im, 'Is yer stole any mo' hams lately?' er 'W'at yer take fer yo'\nneckliss, Dave?' er some joke er 'nuther 'bout dat ham.\n\n\"Fus' Dave didn' mine it so much, caze he knowed he hadn' done nuffin.\nBut bimeby he got so he couldn' stan' it no longer, en he'd hide hisse'f\nin de bushes w'eneber he seed anybody comin', en alluz kep' hisse'f shet\nup in his cabin atter he come in fum wuk.\n\n\"It wuz monst'us hard on Dave, en bimeby, w'at wid dat ham eberlastin'\nen etarnally draggin' roun' his neck, he 'mence' fer ter do en say quare\nthings, en make de niggers wonder ef he wa'n't gittin' out'n his mine.\nHe got ter gwine roun' talkin' ter hisse'f, en singin' corn-shuckin'\nsongs, en laffin' fit ter kill 'bout nuffin. En one day he tole one er\nde niggers he had 'skivered a noo way fer ter raise hams,--gwine ter\npick 'em off'n trees, en save de expense er smoke-'ouses by kyoin' 'em\nin de sun. En one day he up'n tole Mars Walker he got sump'n pertickler\nfer ter say ter 'im; en he tuk Mars Walker off ter one side, en tole 'im\nhe wuz gwine ter show 'im a place in de swamp whar dey wuz a whole trac'\ner lan' covered wid ham-trees.\n\n\"W'en Mars Walker hearn Dave talkin' dis kine er fool-talk, en w'en he\nseed how Dave wuz 'mencin' ter git behine in his wuk, en w'en he ax'\nde niggers en dey tole 'im how Dave be'n gwine on, he 'lowed he reckon'\nhe'd punish' Dave ernuff, en it mou't do mo' harm dan good fer ter\nkeep de ham on his neck any longer. So he sont Dave down ter de\nblacksmif-shop en had de ham tak off. Dey wa'n't much er de ham lef' by\ndat time, fer de sun had melt all de fat, en de lean had all swivel' up,\nso dey wa'n't but th'ee er fo' poun's lef'.\n\n\"W'en de ham had be'n tuk off'n Dave, folks kinder stopped talkin' 'bout\n'im so much. But de ham had be'n on his neck so long dat Dave had sorter\ngot use' ter it. He look des lack he'd los' sump'n fer a day er so atter\nde ham wuz tuk off, en didn' 'pear ter know w'at ter do wid hisse'f;\nen fine'ly he up'n tuk'n tied a lightered-knot ter a string, en hid it\nunder de flo' er his cabin, en w'en nobody wuzn' lookin' he'd take it\nout en hang it roun' his neck, en go off in de woods en holler en sing;\nen he allus tied it roun' his neck w'en he went ter sleep. Fac', it\n'peared lack Dave done gone clean out'n his mine. En atter a w'ile he\ngot one er de quarest notions you eber hearn tell un. It wuz 'bout dat\ntime dat I come back ter de plantation fer ter wuk,--I had be'n out ter\nMars Dugal's yuther place on Beaver Crick for a mont' er so. I had hearn\n'bout Dave en de bacon, en 'bout w'at wuz gwine on on de plantation; but\nI didn' b'lieve w'at dey all say 'bout Dave, fer I knowed Dave wa'n't\ndat kine er man. One day atter I come back, me'n Dave wuz choppin'\ncotton tergedder, w'en Dave lean' on his hoe, en motion' fer me ter come\nober close ter 'im; en den he retch' ober en w'ispered ter me.\n\n\"'Julius', [sic] sezee, 'did yer knowed yer wuz wukkin' long yer wid a\nham?'\n\n\"I couldn 'magine w'at he meant.

In less'n a week atter he gin dis warnin', he\ncotch a nigger in de hen-'ouse, en fill' 'im full er squir'l-shot. W'en\nhe got a light, he 'skivered it wuz a strange nigger; en w'en he call'\none er his own sarven's, de nigger tole 'im it wuz our Wiley.

I went into the house. When I came out, half an hour\nlater, I saw Julius disappearing down the lane, with a basket on his\narm.\n\nAt breakfast, next morning, it occurred to me that I should like a slice\nof ham. I said as much to my wife.\n\n\"Oh, no, John,\" she responded, \"you shouldn't eat anything so heavy for\nbreakfast.\"\n\nI insisted.\n\n\"The fact is,\" she said, pensively, \"I couldn't have eaten any more of\nthat ham, and so I gave it to Julius.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE AWAKENING OF THE NEGRO by Booker T. Washington\n\n\nWhen a mere boy, I saw a young colored man, who had spent several years\nin school, sitting in a common cabin in the South, studying a French\ngrammar. I noted the poverty, the untidiness, the want of system and\nthrift, that existed about the cabin, notwithstanding his knowledge of\nFrench and other academic subjects. Another time, when riding on the\nouter edges of a town in the South, I heard the sound of a piano coming\nfrom a cabin of the same kind. Contriving some excuse, I entered, and\nbegan a conversation with the young colored woman who was playing, and\nwho had recently returned from a boarding-school, where she had been\nstudying instrumental music among other things. Despite the fact that\nher parents were living in a rented cabin, eating poorly cooked food,\nsurrounded with poverty, and having almost none of the conveniences of\nlife, she had persuaded them to rent a piano for four or five dollars\nper month. Many such instances as these, in connection with my own\nstruggles, impressed upon me the importance of making a study of our\nneeds as a race, and applying the remedy accordingly.\n\nSome one may be tempted to ask, Has not the negro boy or girl as good\na right to study a French grammar and instrumental music as the white\nyouth? I answer, Yes, but in the present condition of the negro race in\nthis country there is need of something more. Perhaps I may be forgiven\nfor the seeming egotism if I mention the expansion of my own life partly\nas an example of what I mean. My earliest recollection is of a small\none-room log hut on a large slave plantation in Virginia. After the\nclose of the war, while working in the coal-mines of West Virginia for\nthe support of my mother, I heart in some accidental way of the Hampton\nInstitute. When I learned that it was an institution where a black boy\ncould study, could have a chance to work for his board, and at the\nsame time be taught how to work and to realize the dignity of labor,\nI resolved to go there. Bidding my mother good-by, I started out one\nmorning to find my way to Hampton, though I was almost penniless and\nhad no definite idea where Hampton was. By walking, begging rides,\nand paying for a portion of the journey on the steam-cars, I finally\nsucceeded in reaching the city of Richmond, Virginia. I was without\nmoney or friends. I slept under a sidewalk, and by working on a vessel\nnext day I earned money to continue my way to the institute, where\nI arrived with a surplus of fifty cents. At Hampton I found the\nopportunity--in the way of buildings, teachers, and industries provided\nby the generous--to get training in the class-room and by practical\ntouch with industrial life, to learn thrift, economy, and push. I was\nsurrounded by an atmosphere of business, Christian influence, and a\nspirit of self-help that seemed to have awakened every faculty in me,\nand caused me for the first time to realize what it meant to be a man\ninstead of a piece of property.\n\nWhile there I resolved that when I had finished the course of training I\nwould go into the far South, into the Black Belt of the South, and give\nmy life to providing the same kind of opportunity for self-reliance\nand self-awakening that I had found provided for me at Hampton. My work\nbegan at Tuskegee, Alabama, in 1881, in a small shanty and church, with\none teacher and thirty students, without a dollar's worth of property.\nThe spirit of work and of industrial thrift, with aid from the State and\ngenerosity from the North, has enabled us to develop an institution of\neight hundred students gathered from nineteen States, with seventy-nine\ninstructors, fourteen hundred acres of land, and thirty buildings,\nincluding large and small; in all, property valued at $280,000.\nTwenty-five industries have been organized, and the whole work is\ncarried on at an annual cost of about $80,000 in cash; two fifths of the\nannual expense so far has gone into permanent plant.\n\nWhat is the object of all this outlay? First, it must be borne in mind\nthat we have in the South a peculiar and unprecedented state of things.\nIt is of the utmost importance that our energy be given to meeting\nconditions that exist right about us rather than conditions that existed\ncenturies ago or that exist in countries a thousand miles away. What\nare the cardinal needs among the seven millions of colored people in the\nSouth, most of whom are to be found on the plantations? Roughly, these\nneeds may be stated as food, clothing, shelter, education, proper\nhabits, and a settlement of race relations. The seven millions of\ncolored people of the South cannot be reached directly by any missionary\nagency, but they can be reached by sending out among them strong\nselected young men and women, with the proper training of head, hand,\nand heart, who will live among these masses and show them how to lift\nthemselves up.\n\nThe problem that the Tuskegee Institute keeps before itself constantly\nis how to prepare these leaders. From the outset, in connection with\nreligious and academic training, it has emphasized industrial or hand\ntraining as a means of finding the way out of present conditions. First,\nwe have found the industrial teaching useful in giving the student a\nchance to work out a portion of his expenses while in school. Second,\nthe school furnishes labor that has an economic value, and at the same\ntime gives the student a chance to acquire knowledge and skill while\nperforming the labor. Most of all, we find the industrial system\nvaluable in teaching economy, thrift, and the dignity of labor, and in\ngiving moral backbone to students. The fact that a student goes out into\nthe world conscious of his power to build a house or a wagon, or to make\na harness, gives him a certain confidence and moral independence that he\nwould not possess without such training.\n\nA more detailed example of our methods at Tuskegee may be of interest.\nFor example, we cultivate by student labor six hundred and fifty acres\nof land. The object is not only to cultivate the land in a way to\nmake it pay our boarding department, but at the same time to teach the\nstudents, in addition to the practical work, something of the chemistry\nof the soil, the best methods of drainage, dairying, the cultivation\nof fruit, the care of livestock and tools, and scores of other\nlessons needed by a people whose main dependence is on agriculture.\nNotwithstanding that eighty-five per cent of the colored people in the\nSouth live by agriculture in some form, aside from what has been done by\nHampton, Tuskegee, and one or two other institutions practically nothing\nhas been attempted in the direction of teaching them about the very\nindustry from which the masses of our people must get their subsistence.\nFriends have recently provided means for the erection of a large new\nchapel at Tuskegee. Our students have made the bricks for this chapel.\nA large part of the timber is sawed by students at our own sawmill, the\nplans are drawn by our teacher of architecture and mechanical drawing,\nand students do the brick-masonry, plastering, painting, carpentry work,\ntinning, slating, and make most of the furniture. Practically, the whole\nchapel will be built and furnished by student labor; in the end the\nschool will have the building for permanent use, and the students will\nhave a knowledge of the trades employed in its construction. In this way\nall but three of the thirty buildings on the grounds have been erected.\nWhile the young men do the kinds of work I have mentioned, the young\nwomen to a large extent make, mend, and launder the clothing of the\nyoung men, and thus are taught important industries.\n\nOne of the objections sometimes urged against industrial education for\nthe negro is that it aims merely to teach him to work on the same plan\nthat he was made to follow when in slavery. This is far from being the\nobject at Tuskegee. At the head of each of the twenty-five industrial\ndepartments we have an intelligent and competent instructor, just as\nwe have in our history classes, so that the student is taught not only\npractical brick-masonry, for example, but also the underlying principles\nof that industry, the mathematics and the mechanical and architectural\ndrawing. Or he is taught how to become master of the forces of nature\nso that, instead of cultivating corn in the old way, he can use a corn\ncultivator, that lays off the furrows, drops the corn into them, and\ncovers it, and in this way he can do more work than three men by the\nold process of corn-planting; at the same time much of the toil is\neliminated and labor is dignified. In a word, the constant aim is to\nshow the student how to put brains into every process of labor; how\nto bring his knowledge of mathematics and the sciences into farming,\ncarpentry, forging, foundry work; how to dispense as soon as possible\nwith the old form of ante-bellum labor. In the erection of the chapel\njust referred to, instead of letting the money which was given us go\ninto outside hands, we make it accomplish three objects: first, it\nprovides the chapel; second, it gives the students a chance to get a\npractical knowledge of the trades connected with building; and third,\nit enables them to earn something toward the payment of board while\nreceiving academic and industrial training.\n\nHaving been fortified at Tuskegee by education of mind, skill of hand,\nChristian character, ideas of thrift, economy, and push, and a spirit\nof independence, the student is sent out to become a centre of influence\nand light in showing the masses of our people in the Black Belt of the\nSouth how to lift themselves up. How can this be done? I give but one\nor two examples. Ten years ago a young colored man came to the institute\nfrom one of the large plantation districts; he studied in the class-room\na portion of the time, and received practical and theoretical training\non the farm the remainder of the time. Having finished his course at\nTuskegee, he returned to his plantation home, which was in a county\nwhere the colored people outnumber the whites six to one, as is true\nof many of the counties in the Black Belt of the South. He found the\nnegroes in debt. Ever since the war they had been mortgaging their crops\nfor the food on which to live while the crops were growing. The majority\nof them were living from hand to mouth on rented land, in small,\none-room log cabins, and attempting to pay a rate of interest on their\nadvances that ranged from fifteen to forty per cent per annum. The\nschool had been taught in a wreck of a log cabin, with no apparatus, and\nhad never been in session longer than three months out of twelve. With\nas many as eight or ten persons of all ages and conditions and of both\nsexes huddled together in one cabin year after year, and with a minister\nwhose only aim was to work upon the emotions of the people, one can\nimagine something of the moral and religious state of the community.\n\nBut the remedy. In spite of the evil, the negro got the habit of work\nfrom slavery. The rank and file of the race, especially those on the\nSouthern plantations, work hard, but the trouble is, what they earn\ngets away from them in high rents, crop mortgages, whiskey, snuff, cheap\njewelry, and the like. The young man just referred to had been trained\nat Tuskegee, as most of our graduates are, to meet just this condition\nof things. He took the three months' public school as a nucleus for his\nwork. Then he organized the older people into a club, or conference,\nthat held meetings every week. In these meetings he taught the people in\na plain, simple manner how to save their money, how to farm in a better\nway, how to sacrifice,--to live on bread and potatoes, if need be, till\nthey could get out of debt, and begin the buying of lands.\n\nSoon a large proportion of the people were in condition to make\ncontracts for the buying of homes (land is very cheap in the South),\nand to live without mortgaging their crops. Not only this: under the\nguidance and leadership of this teacher, the first year that he was\namong them they learned how, by contributions in money and labor, to\nbuild a neat, comfortable schoolhouse that replaced the wreck of a\nlog cabin formerly used. The following year the weekly meetings were\ncontinued, and two months were added to the original three months of\nschool. The next year two more months were added. The improvement has\ngone on, until now these people have every year an eight months' school.\n\nI wish my readers could have the chance that I have had of going into\nthis community. I wish they could look into the faces of the people and\nsee them beaming with hope and delight. I wish they could see the two\nor three room cottages that have taken the place of the usual one-room\ncabin, the well-cultivated farms, and the religious life of the people\nthat now means something more than the name. The teacher has a good\ncottage and a well-kept farm that serve as models. In a word, a\ncomplete revolution has been wrought in the industrial, educational, and\nreligious life of this whole community by reason of the fact that they\nhave had this leader, this guide and object-lesson, to show them how to\ntake the money and effort that had hitherto been scattered to the wind\nin mortgages and high rents, in whiskey and gewgaws, and concentrate\nthem in the direction of their own uplifting. One community on its\nfeet presents an object-lesson for the adjoining communities, and soon\nimprovements show themselves in other places.\n\nAnother student who received academic and industrial training at\nTuskegee established himself, three years ago, as a blacksmith and\nwheelwright in a community, and, in addition to the influence of his\nsuccessful business enterprise, he is fast making the same kind of\nchanges in the life of the people about him that I have just recounted.\nIt would be easy for me to fill many pages describing the influence of\nthe Tuskegee graduates in every part of the South. We keep it constantly\nin the minds of our students and graduates that the industrial or\nmaterial condition of the masses of our people must be improved, as well\nas the intellectual, before there can be any permanent change in their\nmoral and religious life. We find it a pretty hard thing to make a good\nChristian of a hungry man. No matter how much our people \"get happy\" and\n\"shout\" in church, if they go home at night from church hungry, they are\ntempted to find something before morning. This is a principle of human\nnature, and is not confined to the negro.\n\nThe negro has within him immense power for self-uplifting, but for years\nit will be necessary to guide and stimulate him. The recognition of\nthis power led us to organize, five years ago, what is now known as the\nTuskegee Negro Conference,--a gathering that meets every February, and\nis composed of about eight hundred representative colored men and women\nfrom all sections of the Black Belt. They come in ox-carts, mule-carts,\nbuggies, on muleback and horseback, on foot, by railroad: some traveling\nall night in order to be present. The matters considered at the\nconferences are those that the colored people have it within their own\npower to control: such as the evils of the mortgage system, the one-room\ncabin, buying on credit, the importance of owning a home and of putting\nmoney in the bank, how to build schoolhouses and prolong the school\nterm, and how to improve their moral and religious condition.\n\nAs a single example of the results, one delegate reported that since\nthe conferences were started five years ago eleven people in his\nneighborhood had bought homes, fourteen had got out of debt, and a\nnumber had stopped mortgaging their crops. Moreover, a schoolhouse\nhad been built by the people themselves, and the school term had\nbeen extended from three to six months; and with a look of triumph he\nexclaimed, \"We is done stopped libin' in de ashes!\"\n\nBesides this Negro Conference for the masses of the people, we now have\na gathering at the same time known as the Workers' Conference, composed\nof the officers and instructors in the leading colored schools of the\nSouth. After listening to the story of the conditions and needs from the\npeople themselves, the Workers' Conference finds much food for thought\nand discussion.\n\nNothing else so soon brings about right relations between the two races\nin the South as the industrial progress of the negro. Friction between\nthe races will pass away in proportion as the black man, by reason of\nhis skill, intelligence, and character, can produce something that the\nwhite man wants or respects in the commercial world. This is another\nreason why at Tuskegee we push the industrial training. We find that as\nevery year we put into a Southern community colored men who can start\na brick-yard, a sawmill, a tin-shop, or a printing-office,--men who\nproduce something that makes the white man partly dependent upon the\nnegro, instead of all the dependence being on the other side,--a change\ntakes place in the relations of the races.\n\nLet us go on for a few more years knitting our business and industrial\nrelations into those of the white man, till a black man gets a mortgage\non a white man's house that he can foreclose at will. The white man on\nwhose house the mortgage rests will not try to prevent that negro from\nvoting when he goes to the polls. It is through the dairy farm, the\ntruck garden, the trades, and commercial life, largely, that the negro\nis to find his way to the enjoyment of all his rights. Whether he will\nor not, a white man respects a negro who owns a two-story brick house.\n\nWhat is the permanent value of the Tuskegee system of training to the\nSouth in a broader sense? In connection with this, it is well to bear\nin mind that slavery taught the white man that labor with the hands was\nsomething fit for the negro only, and something for the white man to\ncome into contact with just as little as possible. It is true that there\nwas a large class of poor white people who labored with the hands, but\nthey did it because they were not able to secure negroes to work for\nthem; and these poor whites were constantly trying to imitate the\nslave-holding class in escaping labor, and they too regarded it as\nanything but elevating. The negro in turn looked down upon the poor\nwhites with a certain contempt because they had to work. The negro, it\nis to be borne in mind, worked under constant protest, because he felt\nthat his labor was being unjustly required, and he spent almost as much\neffort in planning how to escape work as in learning how to work. Labor\nwith him was a badge of degradation. The white man was held up before\nhim as the highest type of civilization, but the negro noted that this\nhighest type of civilization himself did no labor; hence he argued that\nthe less work he did, the more nearly he would be like a white man.\nThen, in addition to these influences, the slave system discouraged\nlabor-saving machinery. To use labor-saving machinery intelligence was\nrequired, and intelligence and slavery were not on friendly terms; hence\nthe negro always associated labor with toil, drudgery, something to be\nescaped. When the negro first became free, his idea of education was\nthat it was something that would soon put him in the same position\nas regards work that his recent master had occupied. Out of these\nconditions grew the Southern habit of putting off till to-morrow and the\nday after the duty that should be done promptly to-day. The leaky house\nwas not repaired while the sun shone, for then the rain did not come\nthrough. While the rain was falling, no one cared to expose himself to\nstop the leak. The plough, on the same principle, was left where the\nlast furrow was run, to rot and rust in the field during the winter.\nThere was no need to repair the wooden chimney that was exposed to the\nfire, because water could be thrown on it when it was on fire. There was\nno need to trouble about the payment of a debt to-day, for it could just\nas well be paid next week or next year. Besides these conditions, the\nwhole South, at the close of the war, was without proper food, clothing,\nand shelter,--was in need of habits of thrift and economy and of\nsomething laid up for a rainy day.\n\nTo me it seemed perfectly plain that here was a condition of things that\ncould not be met by the ordinary process of education. At Tuskegee we\nbecame convinced that the thing to do was to make a careful systematic\nstudy of the condition and needs of the South, especially the Black\nBelt, and to bend our efforts in the direction of meeting these needs,\nwhether we were following a well-beaten track, or were hewing out a new\npath to meet conditions probably without a parallel in the world.\nAfter fourteen years of experience and observation, what is the result?\nGradually but surely, we find that all through the South the disposition\nto look upon labor as a disgrace is on the wane, and the parents who\nthemselves sought to escape work are so anxious to give their children\ntraining in intelligent labor that every institution which gives\ntraining in the handicrafts is crowded, and many (among them Tuskegee)\nhave to refuse admission to hundreds of applicants. The influence of\nthe Tuskegee system is shown again by the fact that almost every\nlittle school at the remotest cross-roads is anxious to be known as\nan industrial school, or, as some of the colored people call it, an\n\"industrus\" school.\n\nThe social lines that were once sharply drawn between those who labored\nwith the hand and those who did not are disappearing. Those who formerly\nsought to escape labor, now when they see that brains and skill rob\nlabor of the toil and drudgery once associated with it, instead of\ntrying to avoid it are willing to pay to be taught how to engage in it.\nThe South is beginning to see labor raised up, dignified and beautified,\nand in this sees its salvation. In proportion as the love of labor\ngrows, the large idle class which has long been one of the curses of the\nSouth disappears. As its members become absorbed in occupations, they\nhave less time to attend to everybody else's business, and more time for\ntheir own.\n\nThe South is still an undeveloped and unsettled country, and for the\nnext half century and more the greater part of the energy of the masses\nwill be needed to develop its material opportunities. Any force that\nbrings the rank and file of the people to a greater love of industry\nis therefore especially valuable. This result industrial education\nis surely bringing about. It stimulates production and increases\ntrade,--trade between the races,--and in this new and engrossing\nrelation both forget the past. The white man respects the vote of the\ncolored man who does $10,000 worth of business, and the more business\nthe colored man has, the more careful he is how he votes.\n\nImmediately after the war, there was a large class of Southern people\nwho feared that the opening of the free schools to the freedmen and the\npoor whites--the education of the head alone--would result merely in\nincreasing the class who sought to escape labor, and that the South\nwould soon be overrun by the idle and vicious. But as the results of\nindustrial combined with academic training begin to show themselves in\nhundreds of communities that have been lifted up through the medium of\nthe Tuskegee system, these former prejudices against education are being\nremoved. Many of those who a few years ago opposed general education are\nnow among its warmest advocates.\n\nThis industrial training, emphasizing as it does the idea of economic\nproduction, is gradually bringing the South to the point where it is\nfeeding itself. Before the war, and long after it, the South made what\nlittle profit was received from the cotton crop, and sent its earnings\nout of the South to purchase food supplies,--meat, bread, canned\nvegetables, and the like; but the improved methods of agriculture are\nfast changing this habit. With the newer methods of labor, which teach\npromptness and system, and emphasize the worth of the beautiful,--the\nmoral value of the well-painted house, and the fence with every paling\nand nail in its place,--we are bringing to bear upon the South an\ninfluence that is making it a new country in industry, education, and\nreligion.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STORY OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN by Charles Dudley Warner\n\n\nOn the 29th of June, 1852, Henry Clay died. In that month the two great\npolitical parties, in their national conventions, had accepted as a\nfinality all the compromise measures of 1850, and the last hours of the\nKentucky statesman were brightened by the thought that his efforts had\nsecured the perpetuity of the Union.\n\nBut on the 20th of March, 1852, there had been an event, the\nsignificance of which was not taken into account by the political\nconventions or by Clay, which was to test the conscience of the nation.\nThis was the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Was this only an \"event,\"\nthe advent of a new force in politics; was the book merely an abolition\npamphlet, or was it a novel, one of the few great masterpieces of\nfiction that the world has produced? After the lapse of forty-four\nyears and the disappearance of African slavery on this continent, it is\nperhaps possible to consider this question dispassionately.\n\nThe compromise of 1850 satisfied neither the North nor the South. The\nadmission of California as a free State was regarded by Calhoun as fatal\nto the balance between the free and the slave States, and thereafter a\nfierce agitation sprang up for the recovery of this loss of balance, and\nultimately for Southern preponderance, which resulted in the repeal of\nthe Missouri Compromise, the Kansas-Nebraska war, and the civil war.\nThe fugitive slave law was hateful to the North not only because it was\ncruel and degrading, but because it was seen to be a move formed for\nnationalizing slavery. It was unsatisfactory to the South because it\nwas deemed inadequate in its provisions, and because the South did not\nbelieve the North would execute it in good faith. So unstable did the\ncompromise seem that in less than a year after the passage of all its\nmeasures, Henry Clay and forty-four Senators and Representatives united\nin a manifesto declaring that they would support no man for office who\nwas not known to be opposed to any disturbance of the settlements of\nthe compromise. When, in February, 1851, the recaptured fugitive slave,\nBurns, was rescued from the United States officers in Boston, Clay urged\nthe investment of the President with extraordinary power to enforce the\nlaw.\n\nHenry Clay was a patriot, a typical American. The republic and its\npreservation were the passions of his life. Like Lincoln, who was\nborn in the State of his adoption, he was willing to make almost any\nsacrifice for the maintenance of the Union. He had no sympathy with the\nsystem of slavery. There is no doubt that he would have been happy in\nthe belief that it was in the way of gradual and peaceful extinction.\nWith him, it was always the Union before state rights and before\nslavery. Unlike Lincoln, he had not the clear vision to see that the\nrepublic could not endure half slave and half free. He believed that the\nSouth, appealing to the compromises of the Constitution, would sacrifice\nthe Union before it would give up slavery, and in fear of this menace\nhe begged the North to conquer its prejudices. We are not liable to\noverrate his influence as a compromising pacificator from 1832 to 1852.\nHistory will no doubt say that it was largely due to him that the war on\nthe Union was postponed to a date when its success was impossible.\n\nIt was the fugitive slave law that brought the North face to face with\nslavery nationalized, and it was the fugitive slave law that produced\nUncle Tom's Cabin. The effect of this story was immediate and electric.\nIt went straight to the hearts of tens of thousands of people who had\nnever before considered slavery except as a political institution for\nwhich they had no personal responsibility. What was this book, and how\ndid it happen to produce such an effect? It is true that it struck into\na time of great irritation and agitation, but in one sense there was\nnothing new in it. The facts had all been published. For twenty years\nabolition tracts, pamphlets, newspapers, and books had left little to be\nrevealed, to those who cared to read, as to the nature of slavery or its\neconomic aspects. The evidence was practically all in,--supplied largely\nby the advertisements of Southern newspapers and by the legislation of\nthe slaveholding States,--but it did not carry conviction; that is, the\nsort of conviction that results in action. The subject had to be carried\nhome to the conscience. Pamphleteering, convention-holding, sermons, had\nfailed to do this. Even the degrading requirements of the fugitive slave\nlaw, which brought shame and humiliation, had not sufficed to fuse the\npublic conscience, emphasize the necessity of obedience to the moral\nlaw, and compel recognition of the responsibility of the North for\nslavery. Evidence had not done this, passionate appeals had not done\nit, vituperation had not done it. What sort of presentation of the case\nwould gain the public ear and go to the heart? If Mrs. Stowe, in all her\nfervor, had put forth first the facts in The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin,\nwhich so buttressed her romance, the book would have had no more effect\nthan had followed the like compilations and arraignments. What was\nneeded? If we can discover this, we shall have the secret of this\nepoch-making novel.\n\nThe story of this book has often been told. It is in the nature of a\ndramatic incident of which the reader never tires any more than the son\nof Massachusetts does of the minutest details of that famous scene in\nthe Senate Chamber when Webster replied to Hayne.\n\nAt the age of twenty-four the author was married and went to live in\nCincinnati, where her husband held a chair in the Lane Theological\nSeminary. There for the first time she was brought into relations\nwith the African race and saw the effects of slavery. She visited\nslaveholders in Kentucky and had friends among them. In some homes she\nsaw the \"patriarchal\" institution at its best. The Beecher family were\nanti-slavery, but they had not been identified with the abolitionists,\nexcept perhaps Edward, who was associated with the murdered Lovejoy.\nIt was long a reproach brought by the abolitionists against Henry Ward\nBeecher that he held entirely aloof from their movement. At Cincinnati,\nhowever, the personal aspects of the case were brought home to Mrs.\nStowe. She learned the capacities and peculiarities of the negro race.\nThey were her servants; she taught some of them; hunted fugitives\napplied to her; she ransomed some by her own efforts; every day there\ncame to her knowledge stories of the hunger for freedom, of the ruthless\nseparation of man and wife and mother and child, and of the heroic\nsufferings of those who ran away from the fearful doom of those \"sold\ndown South.\" These things crowded upon her mind and awoke her deepest\ncompassion. But what could she do against all the laws, the political\nand commercial interests, the great public apathy? Relieve a case here\nand there, yes. But to dwell upon the gigantic evil, with no means of\nmaking head against it, was to invite insanity.\n\nAs late as 1850, when Professor Stowe was called to Bowdoin College, and\nthe family removed to Brunswick, Maine, Mrs. Stowe had not felt impelled\nto the duty she afterwards undertook. \"In fact, it was a sort of general\nimpression upon her mind, as upon that of many humane people in those\ndays, that the subject was so dark and painful a one, so involved in\ndifficulty and obscurity, so utterly beyond human hope or help, that it\nwas of no use to read, or think, or distress one's self about it.\" But\nwhen she reached New England the excitement over the fugitive slave law\nwas at its height. There was a panic in Boston among the colored people\nsettled there, who were daily fleeing to Canada. Every mail brought her\npitiful letters from Boston, from Illinois, and elsewhere, of the terror\nand despair caused by the law. Still more was the impressed by the\napathy of the Christian world at the North, and surely, she said, the\npeople did not understand what the \"system\" was. Appeals were made to\nher, who had some personal knowledge of the subject, to take up her pen.\nThe task seemed beyond her in every way. She was not strong, she was in\nthe midst of heavy domestic cares, with a young infant, with pupils to\nwhom she was giving daily lessons, and the limited income of the family\nrequired the strictest economy. The dependence was upon the small salary\nof Professor Stowe, and the few dollars she could earn by an occasional\nnewspaper or magazine article. But the theme burned in her mind, and\nfinally took this shape: at least she would write some sketches and show\nthe Christian world what slavery really was, and what the system was\nthat they were defending. She wanted to do this with entire fairness,\nshowing all the mitigations of the \"patriarchal\" system, and all that\nindividuals concerned in it could do to alleviate its misery. While\npondering this she came by chance, in a volume of an anti-slavery\nmagazine, upon the authenticated account of the escape of a woman with\nher child on the ice across the Ohio River from Kentucky. She began to\nmeditate. The faithful slave husband in Kentucky, who had refused to\nescape from a master who trusted him, when he was about to be sold \"down\nriver,\" came to her as a pattern of Uncle Tom, and the scenes of the\nstory began to form themselves in her mind. \"The first part of the book\never committed to writing [this is the statement of Mrs. Stowe] was the\ndeath of Uncle Tom. This scene presented itself almost as a tangible\nvision to her mind while sitting at the communion-table in the little\nchurch in Brunswick. She was perfectly overcome by it, and could\nscarcely restrain the convulsion of tears and sobbings that shook her\nframe. She hastened home and wrote it, and her husband being away, read\nit to her two sons of ten and twelve years of age. The little fellows\nbroke out into convulsions of weeping, one of them saying through his\nsobs, 'Oh, mamma, slavery is the most cursed thing in the world!' From\nthat time the story can less be said to have been composed by her than\nimposed upon her. Scenes, incidents, conversations rushed upon her with\na vividness and importunity that would not be denied. The book insisted\nupon getting itself into being, and would take no denial.\"\n\nWhen two or three chapters were written she wrote to her friend, Dr.\nBailey, of Washington, the editor of The National Era, to which she\nhad contributed, that she was planning a story that might run through\nseveral numbers of the Era. The story was at once applied for, and\nthereafter weekly installments were sent on regularly, in spite of all\ncares and distractions. The installments were mostly written during the\nmorning, on a little desk in a corner of the dining-room of the cottage\nin Brunswick, subject to all the interruptions of house-keeping, her\nchildren bursting into the room continually with the importunity of\nchildhood. But they did not break the spell or destroy her abstraction.\nWith a smile and a word and a motion of the hand she would wave them\noff, and keep on in her magician's work. Long afterwards they recalled\nthis, dimly understood at the time, and wondered at her power of\nconcentration. Usually at night the chapters were read to the family,\nwho followed the story with intense feeling. The narrative ran on for\nnine months, exciting great interest among the limited readers of the\nEra, and gaining sympathetic words from the anti-slavery people, but\nwithout making any wide impression on the public.\n\nWe may pause here in the narrative to note two things: the story was not\nthe work of a novice, and it was written out of abundant experience and\nfrom an immense mass of accumulated thought and material. Mrs. Stowe was\nin her fortieth year. She had been using her pen since she was twelve\nyears old, in extensive correspondence, in occasional essays, in short\nstories and sketches, some of which appeared in a volume called The\nMayflower, published in 1843, and for many years her writing for\nnewspapers and periodicals had added appreciably to the small family\nincome. She was in the maturity of her intellectual powers, she was\ntrained in the art of writing, and she had, as Walter Scott had when he\nbegan the Waverley Novels at the age of forty-three, abundant store of\nmaterials on which to draw. To be sure, she was on fire with a moral\npurpose, but she had the dramatic instinct, and she felt that her object\nwould not be reached by writing an abolition tract.\n\n\"In shaping her material the author had but one purpose, to show the\ninstitution of slavery truly, just as it existed. She had visited in\nKentucky; had formed the acquaintance of people who were just, upright,\nand generous, and yet slave-holders. She had heard their views, and\nappreciated their situation; she felt that justice required that their\ndifficulties should be recognized and their virtues acknowledged. It was\nher object to show that the evils of slavery were the inherent evils of\na bad system, and not always the fault of those who had become involved\nin it and were its actual administrators. Then she was convinced that\nthe presentation of slavery alone, in its most dreadful forms, would\nbe a picture of such unrelieved horror and darkness as nobody could be\ninduced to look at. Of set purpose, she sought to light up the darkness\nby humorous and grotesque episodes, and the presentation of the milder\nand more amusing phases of slavery, for which her recollection of the\nnever-failing wit and drollery of her former colored friends in Ohio\ngave her abundant material.\"\n\nThis is her own account of the process, years after. But it is evident\nthat, whether consciously or unconsciously, she did but follow the\ninevitable law of all great dramatic creators and true story-tellers\nsince literature began.\n\nFor this story Mrs. Stowe received from the Era the sum of three hundred\ndollars. Before it was finished it attracted the attention of Mr. J. P.\nJewett, of Boston, a young and then unknown publisher, who offered to\nissue it in book form. His offer was accepted, but as the tale ran on\nhe became alarmed at its length, and wrote to the author that she was\nmaking the story too long for a one-volume novel; that the subject was\nunpopular; that people would not willingly hear much about it; that one\nshort volume might possibly sell, but that if it grew to two that might\nprove a fatal obstacle to its success. Mrs. Stowe replied that she did\nnot make the story, that the story made itself, and that she could not\nstop it till it was done. The publisher hesitated. It is said that a\ncompetent literary critic to whom he submitted it sat up all night with\nthe novel, and then reported, \"The story has life in it; it will sell.\"\nMr. Jewett proposed to Professor Stowe to publish it on half profits if\nhe would share the expenses. This offer was declined, for the Stowes had\nno money to advance, and the common royalty of ten per cent on the sales\nwas accepted.\n\nMrs. Stowe was not interested in this business transaction. She was\nthinking only of having the book circulated for the effect she had at\nheart. The intense absorption in the story held her until the virtual\nend in the death of Uncle Tom, and then it seemed as if the whole vital\nforce had left her. She sank into a profound discouragement. Would this\nappeal, which she had written with her heart's blood, go for nothing, as\nall the prayers and tears and strivings had already gone? When the last\nproof sheets left her hands, \"it seemed to her that there was no hope;\nthat nobody would read, nobody would pity; that this frightful system,\nwhich had already pursued its victims into the free States, might at\nlast even threaten them in Canada.\" Resolved to leave nothing undone to\nattract attention to her cause, she wrote letters and ordered copies\nof her novel sent to men of prominence who had been known for their\nanti-slavery sympathies,--to Prince Albert, Macaulay, Charles Dickens,\nCharles Kingsley, and Lord Carlisle. Then she waited for the result.\n\nShe had not long to wait. The success of the book was immediate. Three\nthousand copies were sold the first day, within a few days ten thousand\ncopies had gone, on the 1st of April a second edition went to press, and\nthereafter eight presses running day and night were barely able to keep\npace with the demand for it. Within a year three hundred thousand copies\nwere sold. No work of fiction ever spread more quickly throughout the\nreading community or awakened a greater amount of public feeling. It was\nread by everybody, learned and unlearned, high and low, for it was an\nappeal to universal human sympathy, and the kindling of this spread the\nbook like wildfire. At first it seemed to go by acclamation. But this\nwas not altogether owing to sympathy with the theme. I believe that\nit was its power as a novel that carried it largely. The community was\ngenerally apathetic when it was not hostile to any real effort to be rid\nof slavery. This presently appeared. At first there were few dissenting\nvoices from the chorus of praise. But when the effect of the book began\nto be evident it met with an opposition fiercer and more personal than\nthe great wave of affectionate thankfulness which greeted it at first.\nThe South and the defenders and apologists of slavery everywhere were\nup in arms. It was denounced in pulpit and in press, and some of the\nseverest things were said of it at the North. The leading religious\nnewspaper of the country, published in New York, declared that it was\n\"anti-Christian.\"\n\nMrs. Stowe was twice astonished: first by its extraordinary sale, and\nsecond by the quarter from which the assault on it came. She herself\nsays that her expectations were strikingly different from the facts.\n\"She had painted slaveholders as amiable, generous, and just. She had\nshown examples among them of the noblest and most beautiful traits of\ncharacter; had admitted fully their temptations, their perplexities, and\ntheir difficulties, so that a friend of hers who had many relatives in\nthe South wrote to her: 'Your book is going to be the great pacificator;\nit will unite both North and South.' Her expectation was that the\nprofessed abolitionists would denounce it as altogether too mild in\nits dealings with slaveholders. To her astonishment, it was the extreme\nabolitionists who received, and the entire South who rose up against\nit.\"\n\nThere is something almost amusing in Mrs. Stowe's honest expectation\nthat the deadliest blow the system ever suffered should have been\nreceived thankfully by those whose traditions, education, and interests\nwere all bound up in it. And yet from her point of view it was not\naltogether unreasonable. Her blackest villain and most loathsome agent\nof the system, Legree, was a native of Vermont. All her wrath falls\nupon the slave-traders, the auctioneers, the public whippers, and\nthe overseers, and all these persons and classes were detested by the\nSoutherners to the point of loathing, and were social outcasts. The\nslave-traders and the overseers were tolerated as perhaps necessary in\nthe system, but they were never admitted into respectable society. This\nfeeling Mrs. Stowe regarded as a condemnation of the system.\n\nPecuniary reward was the last thing that Mrs. Stowe expected for her\ndisinterested labor, but it suits the world's notion of the fitness of\nthings that this was not altogether wanting. For the millions of copies\nof Uncle Tom scattered over the world the author could expect nothing,\nbut in her own country her copyright yielded her a moderate return that\nlifted her out of poverty and enabled her to pursue her philanthropic\nand literary career. Four months after the publication of the book\nProfessor Stowe was in the publisher's office, and Mr. Jewett asked him\nhow much he expected to receive. \"I hope,\" said Professor Stowe, with a\nwhimsical smile, \"that it will be enough to buy my wife a silk dress.\"\nThe publisher handed him a check for ten thousand dollars.\n\nBefore Mrs. Stowe had a response to the letters accompanying the books\nprivately sent to England, the novel was getting known there. Its career\nin Great Britain paralleled its success in America. In April a copy\nreached London in the hands of a gentleman who had taken it on the\nsteamer to read. He gave it to Mr. Henry Vizetelly, who submitted it to\nMr. David Bogue, a man known for his shrewdness and enterprise. He took\na night to consider it, and then declined it, although it was offered\nto him for five pounds. A Mr. Gilpin also declined it. It was then\nsubmitted to Mr. Salisbury, a printer. This taster for the public sat up\nwith the book till four o'clock in the morning, alternately weeping\nand laughing. Fearing, however, that this result was due to his\nown weakness, he woke up his wife, whom he describes as a rather\nstrong-minded woman, and finding that the story kept her awake and made\nher also laugh and cry, he thought it might safely be printed. It seems,\ntherefore, that Mr. Vizetelly ventured to risk five pounds, and the\nvolume was brought out through the nominal agency of Clarke & Company.\nIn the first week an edition of seven thousand was worked off. It made\nno great stir until the middle of June, but during July it sold at the\nrate of one thousand a week. By the 20th of August the demand for it was\noverwhelming. The printing firm was then employing four hundred\npeople in getting it out, and seventeen printing-machines, besides\nhand-presses. Already one hundred and fifty thousand copies were sold.\nMr. Vizetelly disposed of his interest, and a new printing firm began to\nissue monster editions. About this time the publishers awoke to the fact\nthat any one was at liberty to reprint the book, and the era of cheap\nliterature was initiated, founded on American reprints which cost the\npublisher no royalty. A shilling edition followed the one-and-sixpence,\nand then one complete for sixpence. As to the total sale, Mr. Sampson\nLow reports: \"From April to December, 1852, twelve different editions\n(not reissues) were published, and within the twelve months of its first\nappearance eighteen different London publishing houses were engaged in\nsupplying the great demand that had set in, the total number of editions\nbeing forty, varying from fine illustrated editions at 15s., 10s., and\n7s. 6d. to the cheap popular editions of 1s. 9d. and 6d. After carefully\nanalyzing these editions and weighing probabilities with ascertained\nfacts, I am able pretty confidently to say that the aggregate number of\ncopies circulated in Great Britain and the colonies exceeds one and a\nhalf millions.\" Later, abridgments were published.\n\nAlmost simultaneously with this furor in England the book made its way\non the Continent. Several translations appeared in Germany and France,\nand for the authorized French edition Mrs. Stowe wrote a new preface,\nwhich served thereafter for most of the European editions. I find\nno record of the order of the translations of the book into foreign\nlanguages, but those into some of the Oriental tongues did not\nappear till several years after the great excitement. The ascertained\ntranslations are into twenty-three tongues, namely: Arabic, Armenian,\nChinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Flemish, French, German, Hungarian,\nIllyrian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, modern Greek, Russian,\nServian, Siamese, Spanish, Swedish, Wallachian, and Welsh. Into some\nof these languages several translations were made. In 1878 the British\nMuseum contained thirty-five editions of the original text, and eight\neditions of abridgments or adaptations.\n\nThe story was dramatized in the United States in August, 1852, without\nthe consent or knowledge of the author, and was played most successfully\nin the leading cities, and subsequently was acted in every capital in\nEurope. Mrs. Stowe had neglected to secure the dramatic rights, and\nshe derived no benefit from the great popularity of a drama which still\nholds the stage. From the phenomenal sale of a book which was literally\nread by the whole world, the author received only the ten per cent on\nthe American editions, and by the laws of her own country her copyright\nexpired before her death.\n\n\nThe narrative of the rise and fortunes of this book would be incomplete\nwithout some reference to the response that the author received from\nEngland and the Continent, and of her triumphant progress through the\nBritish Isles. Her letters accompanying the special copies were almost\nimmediately replied to, generally in terms of enthusiastic and fervent\nthankfulness for the book, and before midsummer her mail contained\nletters from all classes of English society. In some of them appeared\na curious evidence of the English sensitiveness to criticism. Lord\nCarlisle and Sir Arthur Helps supplemented their admiration by a protest\nagainst the remark in the mouth of one of the characters that \"slaves\nare better off than a large class of the population of England.\" This\noccurred in the defense of the institution by St. Clare, but it was\ntreated by the British correspondents as the opinion of Mrs. Stowe.\nThe charge was disposed of in Mrs. Stowe's reply: \"The remark on that\nsubject occurs in the dramatic part of the book, in the mouth of an\nintelligent Southerner. As a fair-minded person, bound to state for both\nsides all that could be said, in the person of St. Clare, the best\nthat could be said on that point, and what I know IS in fact constantly\nreiterated, namely, that the laboring class of the South are in many\nrespects, as to physical comfort, in a better condition than the poor\nin England. This is the slaveholder's stereo-typed apology; a defense it\ncannot be, unless two wrongs make one right.\"\n\nIn April, 1853, Mr. and Mrs. Stowe and the latter's brother, Charles\nBeecher, sailed for Europe. Her reception there was like a royal\nprogress. She was met everywhere by deputations and addresses, and\nthe enthusiasm her presence called forth was thoroughly democratic,\nextending from the highest in rank to the lowest. At Edinburgh there\nwas presented to her a national penny offering, consisting of a thousand\ngolden sovereigns on a magnificent silver salver, an unsolicited\ncontribution in small sums by the people.\n\nAt a reception in Stafford House, London, the Duchess of Sutherland\npresented her with a massive gold bracelet, which has an interesting\nhistory. It is made of ten oval links in imitation of slave fetters. On\ntwo of the links were the inscriptions \"March 25, 1807,\" the date of\nthe abolition of the slave-trade, and \"August 1, 1838,\" the date of the\nabolition of slavery in all British territory. The third inscription\nis \"562,848--March 19, 1853,\" the date of the address of the women of\nEngland to the women of America on slavery, and the number of the women\nwho signed. It was Mrs. Stowe's privilege to add to these inscriptions\nthe following: \"Emancipation D. C. Apl. 16, '62;\" \"President's\nProclamation Jan. 1, '63;\" \"Maryland free Oct. 13, '64;\" \"Missouri free\nJan. 11, '65;\" and on the clasp link, \"Constitution amended by Congress\nJan. 31, '65. Constitutional Amendment ratified.\" Two of the links are\nvacant. What will the progress of civilization in America offer for the\nlinks nine and ten?\n\nOne of the most remarkable documents which resulted from Uncle Tom\nwas an address from the women of England to the women of America,\nacknowledging the complicity in slavery of England, but praying aid in\nremoving from the world \"our common crimes and common dishonor,\" which\nwas presented to Mrs. Stowe in 1853. It was the result of a meeting at\nStafford House, and the address, composed by Lord Shaftesbury, was put\ninto the hands of canvassers in England and on the Continent, and as far\nas Jerusalem. The signatures of 562,848 women were obtained, with their\noccupations and residences, from the nobility on the steps of the throne\ndown to maids in the kitchen. The address is handsomely engrossed on\nvellum. The names are contained in twenty-six massive volumes, each\nfourteen inches high by nine in breadth and three inches thick, inclosed\nin an oak case. It is believed that this is the most numerously signed\naddress in existence. The value of the address, with so many names\ncollected in haphazard fashion, was much questioned, but its use was\napparent in the height of the civil war, when Mrs. Stowe replied to it\nin one of the most vigorous and noble appeals that ever came from her\npen. This powerful reply made a profound impression in England.\n\nThis is in brief the story of the book. It is still read, and read the\nworld over, with tears and with laughter; it is still played to excited\naudiences. Is it a great novel, or was it only an event of an era of\nagitation and passion? Has it the real dramatic quality--the poet's\nvisualizing of human life--that makes works of fiction, of imagination,\nlive? Till recently, I had not read the book since 1852. I feared to\nrenew acquaintance with it lest I should find only the shell of an\nexploded cartridge. I took it up at the beginning of a three-hours'\nrailway journey. To my surprise the journey did not seem to last half an\nhour, and half the time I could not keep back the tears from my eyes. A\nLondon critic, full of sympathy with Mrs. Stowe and her work, recently\nsaid, \"Yet she was not an artist, she was not a great woman.\" What is\ngreatness? What is art? In 1862 probably no one who knew General Grant\nwould have called him a great man. But he took Vicksburg. This woman did\nsomething with her pen,--on the whole, the most remarkable and effective\nbook in her generation. How did she do it? Without art? George Sand\nsaid, \"In matters of art there is but one rule, to paint and to move.\nAnd where shall we find conditions more complete, types more vivid,\nsituations more touching, more original, than in Uncle Tom?\" If there\nis not room in our art for such a book, I think we shall have to stretch\nour art a little. \"Women, too, are here judged and painted with a master\nhand.\" This subtle critic, in her overpoweringly tender and enthusiastic\nreview, had already inquired about the capacity of this writer. \"Mrs.\nStowe is all instinct; it is the very reason that she appears to\nsome not to have talent. Has she not talent? What is talent? Nothing,\ndoubtless, compared to genius; but has she genius? I cannot say that she\nhas talent as one understands it in the world of letters, but she has\ngenius as humanity feels the need of genius,--the genius of goodness,\nnot that of the man of letters, but of the saint.\" It is admitted that\nMrs. Stowe was not a woman of letters in the common acceptation of that\nterm, and it is plain that in the French tribunal, where form is of\nthe substance of the achievement, and which reluctantly overlooked the\ncrudeness of Walter Scott, in France where the best English novel seems\na violation of established canons, Uncle Tom would seem to belong where\nsome modern critics place it, with works of the heart, and not of the\nhead. The reviewer is, however, candid: \"For a long time we have striven\nin France against the prolix explanations of Walter Scott. We have cried\nout against those of Balzac, but on consideration have perceived that\nthe painter of manners and character has never done too much, that every\nstroke of the pencil was needed for the general effect. Let us learn\nthen to appreciate all kinds of treatment, where the effect is good, and\nwhere they bear the seal of a master hand.\"\n\nIt must be admitted to the art critic that the book is defective\naccording to the rules of the modern French romance; that Mrs. Stowe\nwas possessed by her subject, and let her fervid interest in it be felt;\nthat she had a definite purpose. That purpose was to quicken the sense\nof responsibility of the North by showing the real character of slavery,\nand to touch the South by showing that the inevitable wrong of it lay in\nthe system rather than in those involved in it. Abundant material was in\nher hands, and the author burned to make it serviceable. What should she\ndo? She might have done what she did afterwards in The Key, presented to\nthe public a mass of statistics, of legal documents. The evidence would\nhave been unanswerable, but the jury might not have been moved by\nit; they would have balanced it by considerations of political and\ncommercial expediency. I presume that Mrs. Stowe made no calculation of\nthis kind. She felt her course, and went on in it. What would an artist\nhave done, animated by her purpose and with her material? He would have\ndone what Cervantes did, what Tourgenieff did, what Mrs. Stowe did. He\nwould have dramatized his facts in living personalities, in effective\nscenes, in vivid pictures of life. Mrs. Stowe exhibited the system of\nslavery by a succession of dramatized pictures, not always artistically\nwelded together, but always effective as an exhibition of the system.\nCervantes also showed a fading feudal romantic condition by a series\nof amusing and pathetic adventures, grouped rather loosely about a\nsingularly fascinating figure.\n\nTourgenieff, a more consummate artist, in his hunting scenes exhibited\nthe effect of serfdom upon society, in a series of scenes with no\nnecessary central figure, without comment, and with absolute concealment\nof any motive. I believe the three writers followed their instincts,\nwithout an analytic argument as to the method, as the great painter\nfollows his when he puts an idea upon canvas. He may invent a theory\nabout it afterwards; if he does not, some one else will invent it for\nhim. There are degrees of art. One painter will put in unnecessary\naccessories, another will exhibit his sympathy too openly, the technique\nor the composition of another can be criticised. But the question is, is\nthe picture great and effective?\n\nMrs. Stowe had not Tourgenieff's artistic calmness. Her mind was fused\ninto a white heat with her message. Yet, how did she begin her story?\nLike an artist, by a highly dramatized scene, in which the actors, by\na few strokes of the pen, appear as distinct and unmistakable\npersonalities, marked by individual peculiarities of manner, speech,\nmotive, character, living persons in natural attitudes. The reader\nbecomes interested in a shrewd study of human nature, of a section\nof life, with its various refinement, coarseness, fastidiousness and\nvulgarity, its humor and pathos. As he goes on he discovers that every\ncharacter has been perfectly visualized, accurately limned from the\nfirst; that a type has been created which remains consistent, which is\nnever deflected from its integrity by any exigencies of plot. This clear\nconception of character (not of earmarks and peculiarities adopted as\nlabels), and faithful adhesion to it in all vicissitudes, is one of the\nrarest and highest attributes of genius. All the chief characters in the\nbook follow this line of absolutely consistent development, from Uncle\nTom and Legree down to the most aggravating and contemptible of all,\nMarie St. Clare. The selfish and hysterical woman has never been so\nfaithfully depicted by any other author.\n\nDistinguished as the novel is by its character-drawing and its pathos,\nI doubt if it would have captivated the world without its humor. This\nis of the old-fashioned kind, the large humor of Scott, and again of\nCervantes, not verbal pleasantry, not the felicities of Lamb, but\nthe humor of character in action, of situations elaborated with great\nfreedom, and with what may be called a hilarious conception. This\nquality is never wanting in the book, either for the reader's\nentertainment by the way, or to heighten the pathos of the narrative by\ncontrast. The introduction of Topsy into the New Orleans household saves\nus in the dangerous approach to melodrama in the religious passages\nbetween Tom and St. Clare. Considering the opportunities of the subject,\nthe book has very little melodrama; one is apt to hear low music on the\nentrance of little Eva, but we are convinced of the wholesome sanity of\nthe sweet child. And it is to be remarked that some of the most exciting\nepisodes, such as that of Eliza crossing the Ohio River on the floating\nice (of which Mr. Ruskin did not approve), are based upon authentic\noccurrences. The want of unity in construction of which the critics\ncomplain is partially explained by the necessity of exhibiting the\neffect of slavery in its entirety. The parallel plots, one running\nto Louisiana and the other to Canada, are tied together by this\nconsideration, and not by any real necessity to each other.\n\nThere is no doubt that Mrs. Stowe was wholly possessed by her theme,\nrapt away like a prophet in a vision, and that, in her feeling at the\ntime, it was written through her quite as much as by her. This idea\ngrew upon her mind in the retrospective light of the tremendous stir the\nstory made in the world, so that in her later years she came to regard\nherself as a providential instrument, and frankly to declare that she\ndid not write the book; \"God wrote it.\" In her own account, when she\nreached the death of Uncle Tom, \"the whole vital force left her.\"\nThe inspiration there left her, and the end of the story, the weaving\ntogether of all the loose ends of the plot, in the joining together\nalmost by miracle the long separated, and the discovery of the\nrelationships, is the conscious invention of the novelist.\n\nIt would be perhaps going beyond the province of the critic to remark\nupon what the author considered the central power of the story, and\nits power to move the world, the faith of Uncle Tom in the Bible.\nThis appeal to the emotion of millions of readers cannot, however, be\noverlooked. Many regard the book as effective in regions remote from our\nperplexities by reason of this grace. When the work was translated into\nSiamese, the perusal of it by one of the ladies of the court induced her\nto liberate all her slaves, men, women, and children, one hundred and\nthirty in all. \"Hidden Perfume,\" for that was the English equivalent of\nher name, said she was wishful to be good like Harriet Beecher Stowe.\nAnd as to the standpoint of Uncle Tom and the Bible, nothing more\nsignificant can be cited than this passage from one of the latest\nwritings of Heinrich Heine:--\n\n\"The reawakening of my religious feelings I owe to that holy book the\nBible. Astonishing that after I have whirled about all my life over all\nthe dance-floors of philosophy, and yielded myself to all the orgies of\nthe intellect, and paid my addresses to all possible systems, without\nsatisfaction like Messalina after a licentious night, I now find myself\non the same standpoint where poor Uncle Tom stands,--on that of the\nBible! I kneel down by my black brother in the same prayer! What a\nhumiliation! With all my science I have come no further than the poor\nignorant negro who has scarce learned to spell. Poor Tom, indeed, seems\nto have seen deeper things in the holy book than I.... Tom, perhaps,\nunderstands them better than I, because more flogging occurs in\nthem; that is to say, those ceaseless blows of the whip which have\naesthetically disgusted me in reading the Gospels and the Acts. But a\npoor negro slave reads with his back, and understands better than we\ndo. But I, who used to make citations from Homer, now begin to quote the\nBible as Uncle Tom does.\"\n\nThe one indispensable requisite of a great work of imaginative fiction\nis its universality, its conception and construction so that it will\nappeal to universal human nature in all races and situations and\nclimates. Uncle Tom's Cabin does that. Considering certain artistic\ndeficiencies, which the French writers perceived, we might say that it\nwas the timeliness of its theme that gave it currency in England and\nAmerica. But that argument falls before the world-wide interest in it\nas a mere story, in so many languages, by races unaffected by our own\nrelation to slavery.\n\nIt was the opinion of James Russell Lowell that the anti-slavery element\nin Uncle Tom and Dred stood in the way of a full appreciation, at least\nin her own country, of the remarkable genius of Mrs. Stowe. Writing in\n1859, he said, \"From my habits and the tendency of my studies I cannot\nhelp looking at things purely from an aesthetic point of view, and what\nI valued in Uncle Tom was the genius, and not the moral.\" This had been\nhis impression when he read the book in Paris, long after the whirl of\nexcitement produced by its publication had subsided, and far removed by\ndistance from local influences. Subsequently, in a review, he wrote, \"We\nfelt then, and we believe now, that the secret of Mrs. Stowe's power lay\nin that same genius by which the great successes in creative literature\nhave always been achieved,--the genius that instinctively goes to the\norganic elements of human nature, whether under a white skin or a black,\nand which disregards as trivial the conventions and fictitious notions\nwhich make so large a part both of our thinking and feeling.... The\ncreative faculty of Mrs. Stowe, like that of Cervantes in Don Quixote\nand of Fielding in Joseph Andrews, overpowered the narrow specialty\nof her design, and expanded a local and temporary theme with the\ncosmopolitanism of genius.\"\n\nA half-century is not much in the life of a people; it is in time an\ninadequate test of the staying power of a book. Nothing is more futile\nthan prophecy on contemporary literary work. It is safe, however, to say\nthat Uncle Tom's Cabin has the fundamental qualities, the sure insight\ninto human nature, and the fidelity to the facts of its own time which\nhave from age to age preserved works of genius.\n\n\n\n\nSTRIVINGS OF THE NEGRO PEOPLE by W. E. Burghardt Du Bois\n\n\nBerween me and the other world there is ever an unasked question:\nunasked by some through feelings of delicacy; by others through the\ndifficulty of rightly framing it. All, nevertheless, flutter round it.\nThey approach me in a half-hesitant sort of way, eye me curiously or\ncompassionately, and then, instead of saying directly, How does it feel\nto be a problem? they say, I know an excellent colored man in my town;\nor, I fought at Mechanicsville; or, Do not these Southern outrages\nmake your blood boil? At these I smile, or am interested, or reduce the\nboiling to a simmer, as the occasion may require. To the real question,\nHow does it feel to be a problem? I answer seldom a word.\n\nAnd yet, being a problem is a strange experience,--peculiar even for\none who has never been anything else, save perhaps in babyhood and\nin Europe. It is in the early days of rollicking boyhood that the\nrevelation first bursts upon one, all in a day, as it were. I remember\nwell when the shadow swept across me. I was a little thing, away up in\nthe hills of New England, where the dark Housatonic winds between Hoosac\nand Taghanic to the sea. In a wee wooden schoolhouse, something put\nit into the boys' and girls' heads to buy gorgeous visiting-cards--ten\ncents a package--and exchange. The exchange was merry, till one girl, a\ntall newcomer, refused my card,--refused it peremptorily, with a glance.\nThen it dawned upon me with a certain suddenness that I was different\nfrom the others; or like, mayhap, in heart and life and longing, but\nshut out from their world by a vast veil. I had thereafter no desire to\ntear down that veil, to creep through; I held all beyond it in common\ncontempt, and lived above it in a region of blue sky and great\nwandering shadows. That sky was bluest when I could beat my mates\nat examination-time, or beat them at a foot-race, or even beat their\nstringy heads. Alas, with the years all this fine contempt began to\nfade; for the world I longed for, and all its dazzling opportunities,\nwere theirs, not mine. But they should not keep these prizes, I said;\nsome, all, I would wrest from them. Just how I would do it I could never\ndecide: by reading law, by healing the sick, by telling the wonderful\ntales that swam in my head,--some way. With other black boys the strife\nwas not so fiercely sunny: their youth shrunk into tasteless sycophancy,\nor into silent hatred of the pale world about them and mocking distrust\nof everything white; or wasted itself in a bitter cry. Why did God\nmake me an outcast and a stranger in mine own house? The \"shades of the\nprison-house\" closed round about us all: walls strait and stubborn to\nthe whitest, but relentlessly narrow, tall, and unscalable to sons of\nnight who must plod darkly on in resignation, or beat unavailing palms\nagainst the stone, or steadily, half hopelessly watch the streak of blue\nabove.\n\nAfter the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and\nMongolian, the Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and\ngifted with second-sight in this American world,--a world which yields\nhim no self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through\nthe revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation, this\ndouble-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through\nthe eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that\nlooks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness,--an\nAmerican, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings;\ntwo warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps\nit from being torn asunder. The history of the American Negro is the\nhistory of this strife,--this longing to attain self-conscious manhood,\nto merge his double self into a better and truer self. In this merging\nhe wishes neither of the older selves to be lost. He does not wish to\nAfricanize America, for America has too much to teach the world and\nAfrica; he does not wish to bleach his Negro blood in a flood of white\nAmericanism, for he believes--foolishly, perhaps, but fervently--that\nNegro blood has yet a message for the world. He simply wishes to make\nit possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American without being\ncursed and spit upon by his fellows, without losing the opportunity of\nself-development.\n\nThis is the end of his striving: to be a co-worker in the kingdom of\nculture, to escape both death and isolation, and to husband and use his\nbest powers. These powers, of body and of mind, have in the past been\nso wasted and dispersed as to lose all effectiveness, and to seem like\nabsence of all power, like weakness. The double-aimed struggle of the\nblack artisan, on the one hand to escape white contempt for a nation\nof mere hewers of wood and drawers of water, and on the other hand to\nplough and nail and dig for a poverty-stricken horde, could only result\nin making him a poor craftsman, for he had but half a heart in either\ncause. By the poverty and ignorance of his people the Negro lawyer or\ndoctor was pushed toward quackery and demagogism, and by the criticism\nof the other world toward an elaborate preparation that overfitted him\nfor his lowly tasks. The would-be black savant was confronted by the\nparadox that the knowledge his people needed was a twice-told tale to\nhis white neighbors, while the knowledge which would teach the white\nworld was Greek to his own flesh and blood. The innate love of harmony\nand beauty that set the ruder souls of his people a-dancing, a-singing,\nand a-laughing raised but confusion and doubt in the soul of the black\nartist; for the beauty revealed to him was the soul-beauty of a race\nwhich his larger audience despised, and he could not articulate the\nmessage of another people.\n\nThis waste of double aims, this seeking to satisfy two unreconciled\nideals, has wrought sad havoc with the courage and faith and deeds of\neight thousand thousand people, has sent them often wooing false gods\nand invoking false means of salvation, and has even at times seemed\ndestined to make them ashamed of themselves. In the days of bondage\nthey thought to see in one divine event the end of all doubt and\ndisappointment; eighteenth-century Rousseauism never worshiped freedom\nwith half the unquestioning faith that the American Negro did for two\ncenturies. To him slavery was, indeed, the sum of all villainies, the\ncause of all sorrow, the root of all prejudice; emancipation was the key\nto a promised land of sweeter beauty than ever stretched before the\neyes of wearied Israelites. In his songs and exhortations swelled\none refrain, liberty; in his tears and curses the god he implored had\nfreedom in his right hand. At last it came,--suddenly, fearfully, like\na dream. With one wild carnival of blood and passion came the message in\nhis own plaintive cadences:--\n\n\n     \"Shout, O children!\n      Shout, you're free!\n     The Lord has bought your liberty!\"\n\n\nYears have passed away, ten, twenty, thirty. Thirty years of national\nlife, thirty years of renewal and development, and yet the swarthy ghost\nof Banquo sits in its old place at the national feast. In vain does the\nnation cry to its vastest problem,--\n\n\"Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves Shall never tremble!\"\n\nThe freedman has not yet found in freedom his promised land. Whatever of\nlesser good may have come in these years of change, the shadow of a deep\ndisappointment rests upon the Negro people,--a disappointment all the\nmore bitter because the unattained ideal was unbounded save by the\nsimple ignorance of a lowly folk.\n\nThe first decade was merely a prolongation of the vain search for\nfreedom, the boom that seemed ever barely to elude their grasp,--like\na tantalizing will-o'-the-wisp, maddening and misleading the headless\nhost. The holocaust of war, the terrors of the Kuklux Klan, the lies of\ncarpet-baggers, the disorganization of industry, and the contradictory\nadvice of friends and foes left the bewildered serf with no new\nwatchword beyond the old cry for freedom. As the decade closed, however,\nhe began to grasp a new idea. The ideal of liberty demanded for its\nattainment powerful means, and these the Fifteenth Amendment gave\nhim. The ballot, which before he had looked upon as a visible sign of\nfreedom, he now regarded as the chief means of gaining and perfecting\nthe liberty with which war had partially endowed him. And why not? Had\nnot votes made war and emancipated millions? Had not votes enfranchised\nthe freedmen? Was anything impossible to a power that had done all this?\nA million black men started with renewed zeal to vote themselves\ninto the kingdom. The decade fled away,--a decade containing, to the\nfreedman's mind, nothing but suppressed votes, stuffed ballot-boxes, and\nelection outrages that nullified his vaunted right of suffrage. And yet\nthat decade from 1875 to 1885 held another powerful movement, the rise\nof another ideal to guide the unguided, another pillar of fire by night\nafter a clouded day. It was the ideal of \"book-learning;\" the curiosity,\nborn of compulsory ignorance, to know and test the power of the\ncabalistic letters of the white man, the longing to know. Mission\nand night schools began in the smoke of battle, ran the gauntlet of\nreconstruction, and at last developed into permanent foundations. Here\nat last seemed to have been discovered the mountain path to Canaan;\nlonger than the highway of emancipation and law, steep and rugged, but\nstraight, leading to heights high enough to overlook life.\n\nUp the new path the advance guard toiled, slowly, heavily, doggedly;\nonly those who have watched and guided the faltering feet, the misty\nminds, the dull understandings of the dark pupils of these schools know\nhow faithfully, how piteously, this people strove to learn. It was weary\nwork. The cold statistician wrote down the inches of progress here and\nthere, noted also where here and there a foot had slipped or some one\nhad fallen. To the tired climbers, the horizon was ever dark, the mists\nwere often cold, the Canaan was always dim and far away. If, however,\nthe vistas disclosed as yet no goal, no resting-place, little but\nflattery and criticism, the journey at least gave leisure for reflection\nand self-examination; it changed the child of emancipation to the youth\nwith dawning self-consciousness, self-realization, self-respect. In\nthose sombre forests of his striving his own soul rose before him, and\nhe saw himself,--darkly as through a veil; and yet he saw in himself\nsome faint revelation of his power, of his mission. He began to have a\ndim feeling that, to attain his place in the world, he must be himself,\nand not another. For the first time he sought to analyze the burden he\nbore upon his back, that dead-weight of social degradation partially\nmasked behind a half-named Negro problem. He felt his poverty; without\na cent, without a home, without land, tools, or savings, he had entered\ninto competition with rich, landed, skilled neighbors. To be a poor man\nis hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom\nof hardships. He felt the weight of his ignorance,--not simply of\nletters, but of life, of business, of the humanities; the accumulated\nsloth and shirking and awkwardness of decades and centuries shackled his\nhands and feet. Nor was his burden all poverty and ignorance. The red\nstain of bastardy, which two centuries of systematic legal defilement\nof Negro women had stamped upon his race, meant not only the loss of\nancient African chastity, but also the hereditary weight of a mass of\nfilth from white whoremongers and adulterers, threatening almost the\nobliteration of the Negro home.\n\nA people thus handicapped ought not to be asked to race with the world,\nbut rather allowed to give all its time and thought to its own social\nproblems. But alas! while sociologists gleefully count his bastards and\nhis prostitutes, the very soul of the toiling, sweating black man is\ndarkened by the shadow of a vast despair. Men call the shadow prejudice,\nand learnedly explain it as the natural defense of culture against\nbarbarism, learning against ignorance, purity against crime, the\n\"higher\" against the \"lower\" races. To which the Negro cries Amen! and\nswears that to so much of this strange prejudice as is founded on just\nhomage to civilization, culture, righteousness, and progress he humbly\nbows and meekly does obeisance. But before that nameless prejudice\nthat leaps beyond all this he stands helpless, dismayed, and well-nigh\nspeechless; before that personal disrespect and mockery, the ridicule\nand systematic humiliation, the distortion of fact and wanton license\nof fancy, the cynical ignoring of the better and boisterous welcoming of\nthe worse, the all-pervading desire to inculcate disdain for everything\nblack, from Toussaint to the devil,--before this there rises a sickening\ndespair that would disarm and discourage any nation save that black host\nto whom \"discouragement\" is an unwritten word.\n\nThey still press on, they still nurse the dogged hope,--not a hope\nof nauseating patronage, not a hope of reception into charmed social\ncircles of stock-jobbers, pork-packers, and earl-hunters, but the hope\nof a higher synthesis of civilization and humanity, a true progress,\nwith which the chorus\n\n\n    \"Peace, good will to men,\"\n    \"May make one music as before,\n     But vaster.\"\n\n\nThus the second decade of the American Negro's freedom was a period of\nconflict, of inspiration and doubt, of faith and vain questionings, of\nSturm and Drang. The ideals of physical freedom, of political power, of\nschool training, as separate all-sufficient panaceas for social ills,\nbecame in the third decade dim and overcast. They were the vain dreams\nof credulous race childhood; not wrong, but incomplete and over-simple.\nThe training of the schools we need to-day more than ever,--the training\nof deft hands, quick eyes and ears, and the broader, deeper, higher\nculture of gifted minds. The power of the ballot we need in sheer\nself-defense, and as a guarantee of good faith. We may misuse it, but\nwe can scarce do worse in this respect than our whilom masters. Freedom,\ntoo, the long-sought, we still seek,--the freedom of life and limb, the\nfreedom to work and think. Work, culture, and liberty,--all these we\nneed, not singly, but together; for to-day these ideals among the Negro\npeople are gradually coalescing, and finding a higher meaning in the\nunifying ideal of race,--the ideal of fostering the traits and talents\nof the Negro, not in opposition to, but in conformity with, the greater\nideals of the American republic, in order that some day, on American\nsoil, two world races may give each to each those characteristics which\nboth so sadly lack. Already we come not altogether empty-handed: there\nis to-day no true American music but the sweet wild melodies of the\nNegro slave; the American fairy tales are Indian and African; we are the\nsole oasis of simple faith and reverence in a dusty desert of dollars\nand smartness. Will America be poorer if she replace her brutal,\ndyspeptic blundering with the light-hearted but determined Negro\nhumility; or her coarse, cruel wit with loving, jovial good humor; or\nher Annie Rooney with Steal Away?\n\nMerely a stern concrete test of the underlying principles of the\ngreat republic is the Negro problem, and the spiritual striving of the\nfreedmen's sons is the travail of souls whose burden is almost beyond\nthe measure of their strength, but who bear it in the name of an\nhistoric race, in the name of this land of their fathers' fathers, and\nin the name of human opportunity.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WIFE OF HIS YOUTH by Charles W. Chesnutt\n\n\nI.\n\nMr. Ryder was going to give a ball. There were several reasons why this\nwas an opportune time for such an event.\n\nMr. Ryder might aptly be called the dean of the Blue Veins. The original\nBlue Veins were a little society of colored persons organized in\na certain Northern city shortly after the war. Its purpose was to\nestablish and maintain correct social standards among a people whose\nsocial condition presented almost unlimited room for improvement. By\naccident, combined perhaps with some natural affinity, the society\nconsisted of individuals who were, generally speaking, more white\nthan black. Some envious outsider made the suggestion that no one was\neligible for membership who was not white enough to show blue veins. The\nsuggestion was readily adopted by those who were not of the favored few,\nand since that time the society, though possessing a longer and\nmore pretentious name, had been known far and wide as the \"Blue Vein\nSociety,\" and its members as the \"Blue Veins.\"\n\nThe Blue Veins did not allow that any such requirement existed for\nadmission to their circle, but, on the contrary, declared that character\nand culture were the only things considered; and that if most of their\nmembers were light-colored, it was because such persons, as a rule, had\nhad better opportunities to qualify themselves for membership. Opinions\ndiffered, too, as to the usefulness of the society. There were those who\nhad been known to assail it violently as a glaring example of the very\nprejudice from which the colored race had suffered most; and later, when\nsuch critics had succeeded in getting on the inside, they had been heard\nto maintain with zeal and earnestness that the society was a life-boat,\nan anchor, a bulwark and a shield, a pillar of cloud by day and of fire\nby night, to guide their people through the social wilderness. Another\nalleged prerequisite for Blue Vein membership was that of free birth;\nand while there was really no such requirement, it is doubtless true\nthat very few of the members would have been unable to meet it if there\nhad been. If there were one or two of the older members who had come up\nfrom the South and from slavery, their history presented enough romantic\ncircumstances to rob their servile origin of its grosser aspects. While\nthere were no such tests of eligibility, it is true that the Blue Veins\nhad their notions on these subjects, and that not all of them were\nequally liberal in regard to the things they collectively disclaimed.\nMr. Ryder was one of the most conservative. Though he had not been\namong the founders of the society, but had come in some years later, his\ngenius for social leadership was such that he had speedily become its\nrecognized adviser and head, the custodian of its standards, and the\npreserver of its traditions. He shaped its social policy, was active in\nproviding for its entertainment, and when the interest fell off, as\nit sometimes did, he fanned the embers until they burst again into a\ncheerful flame. There were still other reasons for his popularity. While\nhe was not as white as some of the Blue Veins, his appearance was such\nas to confer distinction upon them. His features were of a refined type,\nhis hair was almost straight; he was always neatly dressed; his manners\nwere irreproachable, and his morals above suspicion. He had come to\nGroveland a young man, and obtaining employment in the office of a\nrailroad company as messenger had in time worked himself up to the\nposition of stationery clerk, having charge of the distribution of\nthe office supplies for the whole company. Although the lack of early\ntraining had hindered the orderly development of a naturally fine mind,\nit had not prevented him from doing a great deal of reading or from\nforming decidedly literary tastes. Poetry was his passion. He could\nrepeat whole pages of the great English poets; and if his pronunciation\nwas sometimes faulty, his eye, his voice, his gestures, would respond to\nthe changing sentiment with a precision that revealed a poetic soul, and\ndisarm criticism. He was economical, and had saved money; he owned and\noccupied a very comfortable house on a respectable street. His residence\nwas handsomely furnished, containing among other things a good library,\nespecially rich in poetry, a piano, and some choice engravings. He\ngenerally shared his house with some young couple, who looked after his\nwants and were company for him; for Mr. Ryder was a single man. In the\nearly days of his connection with the Blue Veins he had been regarded\nas quite a catch, and ladies and their mothers had manoeuvred with much\ningenuity to capture him. Not, however, until Mrs. Molly Dixon visited\nGroveland had any woman ever made him wish to change his condition to\nthat of a married man.\n\nMrs. Dixon had come to Groveland from Washington in the spring, and\nbefore the summer was over she had won Mr. Ryder's heart. She possessed\nmany attractive qualities. She was much younger than he; in fact, he was\nold enough to have been her father, though no one knew exactly how old\nhe was. She was whiter than he, and better educated. She had moved in\nthe best colored society of the country, at Washington, and had taught\nin the schools of that city. Such a superior person had been eagerly\nwelcomed to the Blue Vein Society, and had taken a leading part in\nits activities. Mr. Ryder had at first been attracted by her charms of\nperson, for she was very good looking and not over twenty-five; then by\nher refined manners and by the vivacity of her wit. Her husband had\nbeen a government clerk, and at his death had left a considerable life\ninsurance. She was visiting friends in Groveland, and, finding the town\nand the people to her liking, had prolonged her stay indefinitely. She\nhad not seemed displeased at Mr. Ryder's attentions, but on the contrary\nhad given him every proper encouragement; indeed, a younger and less\ncautious man would long since have spoken. But he had made up his mind,\nand had only to determine the time when he would ask her to be his wife.\nHe decided to give a ball in her honor, and at some time during the\nevening of the ball to offer her his heart and hand. He had no special\nfears about the outcotme, but, with a little touch of romance, he wanted\nthe surroundings to be in harmony with his own feelings when he should\nhave received the answer he expected.\n\nMr. Ryder resolved that this ball should mark an epoch in the\nsocial history of Groveland. He knew, of course,--no one could know\nbetter,--the entertainments that had taken place in past years, and what\nmust be done to surpass them. His ball must be worthy of the lady in\nwhose honor it was to be given, and must, by the quality of its guests,\nset an example for the future. He had observed of late a growing\nliberality, almost a laxity, in social matters, even among members of\nhis own set, and had several times been forced to meet in a social way\npersons whose complexions and callings in life were hardly up to the\nstandard which he considered proper for the society to maintain. He had\na theory of his own.\n\n\"I have no race prejudice,\" he would say, \"but we people of mixed blood\nare ground between the upper and the nether millstone. Our fate lies\nbetween absorption by the white race and extinction in the black.\nThe one doesn't want us yet, but may take us in time. The other would\nwelcome us, but it would be for us a backward step. 'With malice towards\nnone, with charity for all,' we must do the best we can for ourselves\nand those who are to follow us. Self-preservation is the first law of\nnature.\"\n\nHis ball would serve by its exclusiveness to counteract leveling\ntendencies, and his marriage with Mrs. Dixon would help to further the\nupward process of absorption he had been wishing and waiting for.\n\n\nII.\n\nThe ball was to take place on Friday night. The house had been put in\norder, the carpets covered with canvas, the halls and stairs decorated\nwith palms and potted plants; and in the afternoon Mr. Ryder sat on his\nfront porch, which the shade of a vine running up over a wire netting\nmade a cool and pleasant lounging-place. He expected to respond to the\ntoast \"The Ladies,\" at the supper, and from a volume of Tennyson--his\nfavorite poet--was fortifying himself with apt quotations. The volume\nwas open at A Dream of Fair Women. His eyes fell on these lines, and he\nread them aloud to judge better of their effect:--\n\n\"At length I saw a lady within call. Stiller than chisell'd marble,\nstanding there; A daughter of the gods, divinely tall, And most divinely\nfair.\"\n\nHe marked the verse, and turning the page read the stanza beginning,--\n\n\n   \"O sweet pale Margaret,\n    O rare pale Margaret.\"\n\n\nHe weighed the passage a moment, and decided that it would not do. Mrs.\nDixon was the palest lady he expected at the ball, and she was of a\nrather ruddy complexion, and of lively disposition and buxom build. So\nhe ran over the leaves until his eye rested on the description of Queen\nGuinevere:--\n\n\n    \"She seem'd a part of joyous Spring:\n   A gown of grass-green silk she wore,\n   Buckled with golden clasps before;\n   A light-green tuft of plumes she bore\n     Closed in a golden ring.\n\n  . . . . . . . . . .\n\n  \"She look'd so lovely, as she sway'd\n     The rein with dainty finger-tips,\n   A man had given all other bliss,\n   And all his worldly worth for this,\n   To waste his whole heart in one kiss\n     Upon her perfect lips.\"\n\n\nAs Mr. Ryder murmured these words audibly, with an appreciative thrill,\nhe heard the latch of his gate click, and a light footfall sounding on\nthe steps. He turned his head, and saw a woman standing before the door.\n\nShe was a little woman, not five feet tall, and proportioned to her\nheight. Although she stood erect, and looked around her with very bright\nand restless eyes, she seemed quite old; for her face was crossed and\nrecrossed with a hundred wrinkles, and around the edges of her bonnet\ncould be seen protruding here and there a tuft of short gray wool. She\nwore a blue calico gown of ancient cut, a little red shawl fastened\naround her shoulders with an old-fashioned brass brooch, and a large\nbonnet profusely ornamented with faded red and yellow artificial\nflowers. And she was very black--so black that her toothless gums,\nrevealed when she opened her mouth to speak, were not red, but blue. She\nlooked like a bit of the old plantation life, summoned up from the past\nby the wave of a magician's wand, as the poet's fancy had called into\nbeing the gracious shapes of which Mr. Ryder had just been reading.\n\nHe rose from his chair and came over to where she stood.\n\n\"Good-afternoon, madam,\" he said.\n\n\"Good-evenin', suh,\" she answered, ducking suddenly with a quaint\ncurtsy. Her voice was shrill and piping, but softened somewhat by age.\n\"Is dis yere whar Mistuh Ryduh lib, suh?\" she asked, looking around her\ndoubtfully, and glancing into the open windows, through which some of\nthe preparations for the evening were visible.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, with an air of kindly patronage, unconsciously\nflattered by her manner, \"I am Mr. Ryder. Did you want to see me?\"\n\n\"Yas, suh, ef I ain't 'sturbin' of you too much.\"\n\n\"Not at all. Have a seat over here behind the vine, where it is cool.\nWhat can I do for you?\"\n\n\"'Scuse me, suh,\" she continued, when she had sat down on the edge of\na chair, \"'scuse me, suh, I's lookin' for my husban'. I heerd you wuz a\nbig man an' had libbed heah a long time, an' I 'lowed you wouldn't min'\nef I'd come roun' an' ax you ef you'd eber heerd of a merlatter man by\nde name er Sam Taylor 'quirin' roun' in de chu'ches ermongs' de people\nfer his wife 'Liza Jane?\"\n\nMr. Ryder seemed to think for a moment.\n\n\"There used to be many such cases right after the war,\" he said, \"but it\nhas been so long that I have forgotten them. There are very few now. But\ntell me your story, and it may refresh my memory.\"\n\nShe sat back farther in her chair so as to be more comfortable, and\nfolded her withered hands in her lap.\n\n\"My name's 'Liza,\" she began, \"'Liza Jane. Wen I wuz young I us'ter\nb'long ter Marse Bob Smif, down in old Missourn. I wuz bawn down dere.\nW'en I wuz a gal I wuz married ter a man named Jim. But Jim died, an'\nafter dat I married a merlatter man named Sam Taylor. Sam wuz free-bawn,\nbut his mammy and daddy died, an' de w'ite folks 'prenticed him ter my\nmarster fer ter work fer 'im 'tel he wuz growed up. Sam worked in\nde fiel', an' I wuz de cook. One day Ma'y Ann, ole miss's maid, come\nrushin' out ter de kitchen, an' says she, ''Liza Jane, ole marse gwine\nsell yo' Sam down de ribber.'\n\n\"'Go way f'm yere,' says I; 'my husban's free!'\n\n\"'Don' make no diff'ence. I heerd ole marse tell ole miss he wuz gwine\ntake yo' Sam 'way wid 'im ter-morrow, fer he needed money, an' he knowed\nwhar he could git a t'ousan' dollars fer Sam an' no questions axed.'\n\n\"W'en Sam come home f'm de fiel', dat night, I tole him 'bout ole marse\ngwine steal 'im, an' Sam run erway. His time wuz mos' up, an' he swo'\ndat w'en he wuz twenty-one he would come back an' he'p me run erway, er\nelse save up de money ter buy my freedom. An' I know he'd 'a' done it,\nfer he thought a heap er me, Sam did. But w'en he come back he didn'\nfin' me, fer I wuzn' dere. Ole marse had heerd dat I warned Sam, so he\nhad me whip' an' sol' down de ribber.\n\n\"Den de wah broke out, an' w'en it wuz ober de cullud folks wuz\nscattered. I went back ter de ole home; but Sam wuzn' dere, an' I\ncouldn' l'arn nuffin' 'bout 'im. But I knowed he'd be'n dere to look fer\nme an' hadn' foun' me, an' had gone erway ter hunt fer me.\n\n\"I's be'n lookin' fer 'im eber sence,\" she added simply, as though\ntwenty-five years were but a couple of weeks, \"an' I knows he's be'n\nlookin' fer me. Fer he sot a heap er sto' by me, Sam did, an' I know\nhe's be'n huntin' fer me all dese years,--'less'n he's be'n sick er\nsump'n, so he couldn' work, er out'n his head, so he couldn' 'member his\npromise. I went back down de ribber, fer I 'lowed he'd gone down dere\nlookin' fer me. I's be'n ter Noo Orleens, an' Atlanty, an' Charleston,\nan' Richmon'; an' w'en I'd be'n all ober de Souf I come ter de Norf. Fer\nI knows I'll fin' 'im some er dese days,\" she added softly, \"er he'll\nfin' me, an' den we'll bofe be as happy in freedom as we wuz in de ole\ndays befo' de wah.\" A smile stole over her withered countenance as she\npaused a moment, and her bright eyes softened into a far-away look.\n\nThis was the substance of the old woman's story. She had wandered a\nlittle here and there. Mr. Ryder was looking at her curiously when she\nfinished.\n\n\"How have you lived all these years?\" he asked.\n\n\"Cookin', suh. I's a good cook. Does you know anybody w'at needs a good\ncook, suh? I's stoppin' wid a cullud fam'ly roun' de corner yonder 'tel\nI kin fin' a place.\"\n\n\"Do you really expect to find your husband? He may be dead long ago.\"\n\nShe shook her head emphatically. \"Oh no, he ain' dead. De signs an' de\ntokens tells me. I dremp three nights runnin' on'y dis las' week dat I\nfoun' him.\"\n\n\"He may have married another woman. Your slave marriage would not have\nprevented him, for you never lived with him after the war, and without\nthat your marriage doesn't count.\"\n\n\"Wouldn' make no diff'ence wid Sam. He wouldn' marry no yuther 'ooman\n'tel he foun' out 'bout me. I knows it,\" she added. \"Sump'n's be'n\ntellin' me all dese years dat I's gwine fin' Sam 'fo I dies.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's outgrown you, and climbed up in the world where he\nwouldn't care to have you find him.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, suh,\" she replied, \"Sam ain' dat kin' er man. He wuz good\nter me, Sam wuz, but he wuzn' much good ter nobody e'se, fer he wuz one\ner de triflin'es' han's on de plantation. I 'spec's ter haf ter suppo't\n'im w'en I fin' 'im, fer he nebber would work 'less'n he had ter. But\nden he wuz free, an' he didn' git no pay fer his work, an' I don'\nblame 'im much. Mebbe he's done better sence he run erway, but I ain'\n'spectin' much.\"\n\n\"You may have passed him on the street a hundred times during the\ntwenty-five years, and not have known him; time works great changes.\"\n\nShe smiled incredulously. \"I'd know 'im 'mongs' a hund'ed men. Fer dey\nwuzn' no yuther merlatter man like my man Sam, an' I couldn' be mistook.\nI's toted his picture roun' wid me twenty-five years.\"\n\n\"May I see it?\" asked Mr. Ryder. \"It might help me to remember whether I\nhave seen the original.\"\n\nAs she drew a small parcel from her bosom, he saw that it was fastened\nto a string that went around her neck. Removing several wrappers, she\nbrought to light an old-fashioned daguerreotype in a black case. He\nlooked long and intently at the portrait. It was faded with time, but\nthe features were still distinct, and it was easy to see what manner of\nman it had represented.\n\nHe closed the case, and with a slow movement handed it back to her.\n\n\"I don't know of any man in town who goes by that name,\" he said, \"nor\nhave I heard of any one making such inquiries. But if you will leave me\nyour address, I will give the matter some attention, and if I find out\nanything I will let you know.\"\n\nShe gave him the number of a house in the neighborhood, and went away,\nafter thanking him warmly.\n\nHe wrote down the address on the flyleaf of the volume of Tennyson,\nand, when she had gone, rose to his feet and stood looking after her\ncuriously. As she walked down the street with mincing step, he saw\nseveral persons whom she passed turn and look back at her with a smile\nof kindly amusement. When she had turned the corner, he went upstairs\nto his bedroom, and stood for a long time before the mirror of his\ndressing-case, gazing thoughtfully at the reflection of his own face.\n\n\nIII.\n\nAt eight o'clock the ballroom was a blaze of light and the guests had\nbegun to assemble; for there was a literary programme and some routine\nbusiness of the society to be gone through with before the dancing.\nA black servant in evening dress waited at the door and directed the\nguests to the dressing-rooms.\n\nThe occasion was long memorable among the colored people of the city;\nnot alone for the dress and display, but for the high average of\nintelligence and culture that distinguished the gathering as a whole.\nThere were a number of school-teachers, several young doctors, three or\nfour lawyers, some professional singers, an editor, a lieutenant in\nthe United States army spending his furlough in the city, and others in\nvarious polite callings; these were colored, though most of them would\nnot have attracted even a casual glance because of any marked difference\nfrom white people. Most of the ladies were in evening costume, and dress\ncoats and dancing-pumps were the rule among the men. A band of string\nmusic, stationed in an alcove behind a row of palms, played popular airs\nwhile the guests were gathering.\n\nThe dancing began at half past nine. At eleven o'clock supper was\nserved. Mr. Ryder had left the ballroom some little time before the\nintermission, but reappeared at the supper-table. The spread was worthy\nof the occasion, and the guests did full justice to it. When the coffee\nhad been served, the toastmaster, Mr. Solomon Sadler, rapped for order.\nHe made a brief introductory speech, complimenting host and guests,\nand then presented in their order the toasts of the evening. They were\nresponded to with a very fair display of after-dinner wit.\n\n\"The last toast,\" said the toast-master, when he reached the end of the\nlist, \"is one which must appeal to us all. There is no one of us of the\nsterner sex who is not at some time dependent upon woman,--in infancy\nfor protection, in manhood for companionship, in old age for care and\ncomforting. Our good host has been trying to live alone, but the fair\nfaces I see around me to-night prove that he too is largely dependent\nupon the gentler sex for most that makes life worth living,--the society\nand love of friends,--and rumor is at fault if he does not soon yield\nentire subjection to one of them. Mr. Ryder will now respond to the\ntoast,--The Ladies.\"\n\nThere was a pensive look in Mr. Ryder's eyes as he took the floor and\nadjusted his eyeglasses. He began by speaking of woman as the gift of\nHeaven to man, and after some general observations on the relations of\nthe sexes he said: \"But perhaps the quality which most distinguishes\nwoman is her fidelity and devotion to those she loves. History is full\nof examples, but has recorded none more striking than one which only\nto-day came under my notice.\"\n\nHe then related, simply but effectively, the story told by his visitor\nof the afternoon. He told it in the same soft dialect, which came\nreadily to his lips, while the company listened attentively and\nsympathetically. For the story had awakened a responsive thrill in many\nhearts. There were some present who had seen, and others who had heard\ntheir fathers and grandfathers tell, the wrongs and sufferings of this\npast generation, and all of them still felt, in their darker moments,\nthe shadow hanging over them. Mr. Ryder went on:--\n\n\"Such devotion and such confidence are rare even among women. There are\nmany who would have searched a year, some who would have waited five\nyears, a few who might have hoped ten years; but for twenty-five years\nthis woman has retained her affection for and her faith in a man she has\nnot seen or heard of in all that time.\n\n\"She came to me to-day in the hope that I might be able to help her find\nthis long-lost husband. And when she was gone I gave my fancy rein, and\nimagined a case I will put to you.\n\n\"Suppose that this husband, soon after his escape, had learned that\nhis wife had been sold away, and that such inquiries as he could make\nbrought no information of her whereabouts. Suppose that he was young,\nand she much older than he; that he was light, and she was black; that\ntheir marriage was a slave marriage, and legally binding only if they\nchose to make it so after the war. Suppose, too, that he made his way\nto the North, as some of us have done, and there, where he had larger\nopportunities, had improved them, and had in the course of all these\nyears grown to be as different from the ignorant boy who ran away from\nfear of slavery as the day is from the night. Suppose, even, that he\nhad qualified himself, by industry, by thrift, and by study, to win the\nfriendship and be considered worthy the society of such people as these\nI see around me to-night, gracing my board and filling my heart with\ngladness; for I am old enough to remember the day when such a gathering\nwould not have been possible in this land. Suppose, too, that, as\nthe years went by, this man's memory of the past grew more and more\nindistinct, until at last it was rarely, except in his dreams, that any\nimage of this bygone period rose before his mind. And then suppose that\naccident should bring to his knowledge the fact that the wife of his\nyouth, the wife he had left behind him,--not one who had walked by his\nside and kept pace with him in his upward struggle, but one upon whom\nadvancing years and a laborious life had set their mark,--was alive\nand seeking him, but that he was absolutely safe from recognition or\ndiscovery, unless he chose to reveal himself. My friends, what would\nthe man do? I will suppose that he was one who loved honor, and tried\nto deal justly with all men. I will even carry the case further, and\nsuppose that perhaps he had set his heart upon another, whom he had\nhoped to call his own. What would he do, or rather what ought he to do,\nin such a crisis of a lifetime?\n\n\"It seemed to me that he might hesitate, and I imagined that I was an\nold friend, a near friend, and that he had come to me for advice; and\nI argued the case with him. I tried to discuss it impartially. After we\nhad looked upon the matter from every point of view, I said to him, in\nwords that we all know:\n\n\n   'This above all: to thine own self be true,\n   And it must follow, as the night the day,\n   Thou canst not then be false to any man.'\n\n\nThen, finally, I put the question to him, 'Shall you acknowledge her?'\n\n\"And now, ladies and gentlemen, friends and companions, I ask you, what\nshould he have done?\"\n\nThere was something in Mr. Ryder's voice that stirred the hearts of\nthose who sat around him. It suggested more than mere sympathy with\nan imaginary situation; it seemed rather in the nature of a personal\nappeal. It was observed, too, that his look rested more especially upon\nMrs. Dixon, with a mingled expression of renunciation and inquiry.\n\nShe had listened, with parted lips and streaming eyes. She was the first\nto speak: \"He should have acknowledged her.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" they all echoed, \"he should have acknowledged her.\"\n\n\"My friends and companions,\" responded Mr. Ryder, \"I thank you, one and\nall. It is the answer I expected, for I knew your hearts.\"\n\nHe turned and walked toward the closed door of an adjoining room, while\nevery eye followed him in wondering curiosity. He came back in a moment,\nleading by the hand his visitor of the afternoon, who stood startled and\ntrembling at the sudden plunge into this scene of brilliant gayety. She\nwas neatly dressed in gray, and wore the white cap of an elderly woman.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"this is the woman, and I am the man,\nwhose story I have told you. Permit me to introduce to you the wife of\nmy youth.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOUQUET by Charles W. Chesnutt\n\n\nMary Myrover's friends were somewhat surprised when she began to teach\na colored school. Miss Myrover's friends are mentioned here, because\nnowhere more than in a Southern town is public opinion a force which\ncannot be lightly contravened. Public opinion, however, did not oppose\nMiss Myrover's teaching colored children; in fact, all the colored\npublic schools in town--and there were several--were taught by white\nteachers, and had been so taught since the state had undertaken to\nprovide free public instruction for all children within its boundaries.\nPrevious to that time there had been a Freedman's Bureau school and a\nPresbyterian missionary school, but these had been withdrawn when the\nneed for them became less pressing. The colored people of the town had\nbeen for some time agitating their right to teach their own schools, but\nas yet the claim had not been conceded.\n\nThe reason Miss Myrover's course created some surprise was not,\ntherefore, the fact that a Southern white woman should teach a colored\nschool; it lay in the fact that up to this time no woman of just her\nquality had taken up such work. Most of the teachers of colored schools\nwere not of those who had constituted the aristocracy of the old regime;\nthey might be said rather to represent the new order of things, in which\nlabor was in time to become honorable, and men were, after a somewhat\nlonger time, to depend, for their place in society, upon themselves\nrather than upon their ancestors. But Mary Myrover belonged to one\nof the proudest of the old families. Her ancestors had been people of\ndistinction in Virginia before a collateral branch of the main stock had\nsettled in North Carolina. Before the war they had been able to live\nup to their pedigree. But the war brought sad changes. Miss Myrover's\nfather--the Colonel Myrover who led a gallant but desperate charge at\nVicksburg--had fallen on the battlefield, and his tomb in the white\ncemetery was a shrine for the family. On the Confederate Memorial Day no\nother grave was so profusely decorated with flowers, and in the oration\npronounced the name of Colonel Myrover was always used to illustrate the\nhighest type of patriotic devotion and self-sacrifice. Miss Myrover's\nbrother, too, had fallen in the conflict; but his bones lay in some\nunknown trench, with those of a thousand others who had fallen on the\nsame field. Ay, more, her lover, who had hoped to come home in the\nfull tide of victory and claim his bride as a reward for gallantry, had\nshared the fate of her father and brother. When the war was over, the\nremnant of the family found itself involved in the common ruin,--more\ndeeply involved, indeed, than some others; for Colonel Myrover had\nbelieved in the ultimate triumph of his cause, and had invested most\nof his wealth in Confederate bonds, which were now only so much waste\npaper.\n\nThere had been a little left. Mrs. Myrover was thrifty, and had laid by\na few hundred dollars, which she kept in the house to meet unforeseen\ncontingencies. There remained, too, their home, with an ample garden and\na well-stocked orchard, besides a considerable tract of country land,\npartly cleared, but productive of very little revenue.\n\nWith their shrunken resources, Miss Myrover and her mother were able to\nhold up their heads without embarrassment for some years after the close\nof the war. But when things were adjusted to the changed conditions, and\nthe stream of life began to flow more vigorously in the new channels,\nthey saw themselves in danger of dropping behind, unless in some way\nthey could add to their meagre income. Miss Myrover looked over the\nfield of employment, never very wide for women in the South, and found\nit occupied. The only available position she could be supposed prepared\nto fill, and which she could take without distinct loss of caste, was\nthat of a teacher, and there was no vacancy except in one of the colored\nschools. Even teaching was a doubtful experiment; it was not what she\nwould have preferred, but it was the best that could be done.\n\n\"I don't like it, Mary,\" said her mother. \"It's a long step from owning\nsuch people to teaching them. What do they need with education? It will\nonly make them unfit for work.\"\n\n\"They're free now, mother, and perhaps they'll work better if they're\ntaught something. Besides, it's only a business arrangement, and doesn't\ninvolve any closer contact than we have with our servants.\"\n\n\"Well, I should say not!\" sniffed the old lady. \"Not one of them will\never dare to presume on your position to take any liberties with us.\nI'll see to that.\"\n\nMiss Myrover began her work as a teacher in the autumn, at the opening\nof the school year. It was a novel experience at first. Though there\nalways had been negro servants in the house, and though on the streets\ncolored people were more numerous than her own people, and though she\nwas so familiar with their dialect that she might almost be said to\nspeak it, barring certain characteristic grammatical inaccuracies, she\nhad never been brought in personal contact with so many of them at once\nas when she confronted the fifty or sixty faces--of colors ranging\nfrom a white almost as clear as her own to the darkest livery of the\nsun--which were gathered in the schoolroom on the morning when she began\nher duties. Some of the inherited prejudice of her caste, too, made\nitself felt, though she tried to repress any outward sign of it; and she\ncould perceive that the children were not altogether responsive;\nthey, likewise, were not entirely free from antagonism. The work was\nunfamiliar to her. She was not physically very strong, and at the close\nof the first day she went home with a splitting headache. If she could\nhave resigned then and there without causing comment or annoyance to\nothers, she would have felt it a privilege to do so. But a night's rest\nbanished her headache and improved her spirits, and the next morning she\nwent to her work with renewed vigor, fortified by the experience of the\nfirst day.\n\nMiss Myrover's second day was more satisfactory. She had some natural\ntalent for organization, though she had never known it, and in the\ncourse of the day she got her classes formed and lessons under way. In a\nweek or two she began to classify her pupils in her own mind, as bright\nor stupid, mischievous or well behaved, lazy or industrious, as the case\nmight be, and to regulate her discipline accordingly. That she had come\nof a long line of ancestors who had exercised authority and mastership\nwas perhaps not without its effect upon her character, and enabled her\nmore readily to maintain good order in the school. When she was fairly\nbroken in she found the work rather to her liking, and derived much\npleasure from such success as she achieved as a teacher.\n\nIt was natural that she should be more attracted to some of her pupils\nthan to others. Perhaps her favorite--or rather, the one she liked\nbest, for she was too fair and just for conscious favoritism--was Sophy\nTucker. Just the ground for the teacher's liking for Sophy might not at\nfirst be apparent. The girl was far from the whitest of Miss Myrover's\npupils; in fact, she was one of the darker ones. She was not the\nbrightest in intellect, though she always tried to learn her lessons.\nShe was not the best dressed, for her mother was a poor widow, who went\nout washing and scrubbing for a living. Perhaps the real tie between\nthem was Sophy's intense devotion to the teacher. It had manifested\nitself almost from the first day of the school, in the rapt look of\nadmiration Miss Myrover always saw on the little black face turned\ntoward her. In it there was nothing of envy, nothing of regret; nothing\nbut worship for the beautiful white lady--she was not especially\nhandsome, but to Sophy her beauty was almost divine--who had come to\nteach her. If Miss Myrover dropped a book, Sophy was the first to spring\nand pick it up; if she wished a chair moved, Sophy seemed to anticipate\nher wish; and so of all the numberless little services that can be\nrendered in a school-room.\n\nMiss Myrover was fond of flowers, and liked to have them about her. The\nchildren soon learned of this taste of hers, and kept the vases on her\ndesk filled with blossoms during their season. Sophy was perhaps the\nmost active in providing them. If she could not get garden flowers, she\nwould make excursions to the woods in the early morning, and bring\nin great dew-laden bunches of bay, or jasmine, or some other fragrant\nforest flower which she knew the teacher loved.\n\n\"When I die, Sophy,\" Miss Myrover said to the child one day, \"I want\nto be covered with roses. And when they bury me, I'm sure I shall rest\nbetter if my grave is banked with flowers, and roses are planted at my\nhead and at my feet.\"\n\nMiss Myrover was at first amused at Sophy's devotion; but when she grew\nmore accustomed to it, she found it rather to her liking. It had a sort\nof flavor of the old regime, and she felt, when she bestowed her kindly\nnotice upon her little black attendant, some of the feudal condescension\nof the mistress toward the slave. She was kind to Sophy, and permitted\nher to play the role she had assumed, which caused sometimes a little\njealousy among the other girls. Once she gave Sophy a yellow ribbon\nwhich she took from her own hair. The child carried it home, and\ncherished it as a priceless treasure, to be worn only on the greatest\noccasions.\n\nSophy had a rival in her attachment to the teacher, but the rivalry was\naltogether friendly. Miss Myrover had a little dog, a white spaniel,\nanswering to the name of Prince. Prince was a dog of high degree, and\nwould have very little to do with the children of the school; he made\nan exception, however, in the case of Sophy, whose devotion for his\nmistress he seemed to comprehend. He was a clever dog, and could fetch\nand carry, sit up on his haunches, extend his paw to shake hands, and\npossessed several other canine accomplishments. He was very fond of his\nmistress, and always, unless shut up at home, accompanied her to school,\nwhere he spent most of his time lying under the teacher's desk, or, in\ncold weather, by the stove, except when he would go out now and then and\nchase an imaginary rabbit round the yard, presumably for exercise.\n\nAt school Sophy and Prince vied with each other in their attentions to\nMiss Myrover. But when school was over, Prince went away with her, and\nSophy stayed behind; for Miss Myrover was white and Sophy was black,\nwhich they both understood perfectly well. Miss Myrover taught the\ncolored children, but she could not be seen with them in public. If they\noccasionally met her on the street, they did not expect her to speak to\nthem, unless she happened to be alone and no other white person was in\nsight. If any of the children felt slighted, she was not aware of it,\nfor she intended no slight; she had not been brought up to speak to\nnegroes on the street, and she could not act differently from other\npeople. And though she was a woman of sentiment and capable of deep\nfeeling, her training had been such that she hardly expected to find\nin those of darker hue than herself the same susceptibility--varying in\ndegree, perhaps, but yet the same in kind--that gave to her own life the\nalternations of feeling that made it most worth living.\n\nOnce Miss Myrover wished to carry home a parcel of books. She had the\nbundle in her hand when Sophy came up.\n\n\"Lemme tote yo' bundle fer yer, Miss Ma'y?\" she asked eagerly. \"I'm\ngwine yo' way.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sophy,\" was the reply. \"I'll be glad if you will.\"\n\nSophy followed the teacher at a respectful distance. When they reached\nMiss Myrover's home Sophy carried the bundle to the doorstep, where Miss\nMyrover took it and thanked her.\n\nMrs. Myrover came out on the piazza as Sophy was moving away. She said,\nin the child's hearing, and perhaps with the intention that she should\nhear: \"Mary, I wish you wouldn't let those little darkies follow you\nto the house. I don't want them in the yard. I should think you'd have\nenough of them all day.\"\n\n\"Very well, mother,\" replied her daughter. \"I won't bring any more of\nthem. The child was only doing me a favor.\"\n\nMrs. Myrover was an invalid, and opposition or irritation of any kind\nbrought on nervous paroxysms that made her miserable, and made life a\nburden to the rest of the household; so that Mary seldom crossed her\nwhims. She did not bring Sophy to the house again, nor did Sophy again\noffer her services as porter.\n\nOne day in spring Sophy brought her teacher a bouquet of yellow roses.\n\n\"Dey come off'n my own bush, Miss Ma'y,\" she said proudly, \"an' I didn'\nlet nobody e'se pull 'em, but saved 'em all fer you, 'cause I know you\nlikes roses so much. I'm gwine bring 'em all ter you as long as dey\nlas'.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sophy,\" said the teacher; \"you are a very good girl.\"\n\nFor another year Mary Myrover taught the colored school, and did\nexcellent service. The children made rapid progress under her tuition,\nand learned to love her well; for they saw and appreciated, as well as\nchildren could, her fidelity to a trust that she might have slighted, as\nsome others did, without much fear of criticism. Toward the end of her\nsecond year she sickened, and after a brief illness died.\n\nOld Mrs. Myrover was inconsolable. She ascribed her daughter's death\nto her labors as teacher of negro children. Just how the color of the\npupils had produced the fatal effects she did not stop to explain. But\nshe was too old, and had suffered too deeply from the war, in body\nand mind and estate, ever to reconcile herself to the changed order\nof things following the return of peace; and with an unsound yet not\nunnatural logic, she visited some of her displeasure upon those who had\nprofited most, though passively, by her losses.\n\n\"I always feared something would happen to Mary,\" she said. \"It seemed\nunnatural for her to be wearing herself out teaching little negroes who\nought to have been working for her. But the world has hardly been a fit\nplace to live in since the war, and when I follow her, as I must before\nlong, I shall not be sorry to go.\"\n\nShe gave strict orders that no colored people should be admitted to the\nhouse. Some of her friends heard of this, and remonstrated. They knew\nthe teacher was loved by the pupils, and felt that sincere respect from\nthe humble would be a worthy tribute to the proudest. But Mrs. Myrover\nwas obdurate.\n\n\"They had my daughter when she was alive,\" she said, \"and they've killed\nher. But she's mine now, and I won't have them come near her. I don't\nwant one of them at the funeral or anywhere around.\"\n\nFor a month before Miss Myrover's death Sophy had been watching her\nrosebush--the one that bore the yellow roses--for the first buds of\nspring, and when these appeared had awaited impatiently their gradual\nunfolding. But not until her teacher's death had they become full-blown\nroses. When Miss Myrover died, Sophy determined to pluck the roses and\nlay them on her coffin. Perhaps, she thought, they might even put them\nin her hand or on her breast. For Sophy remembered Miss Myrover's thanks\nand praise when she had brought her the yellow roses the spring before.\n\nOn the morning of the day set for the funeral Sophy washed her\nface until it shone, combed and brushed her hair with painful\nconscientiousness, put on her best frock, plucked her yellow roses, and,\ntying them with the treasured ribbon her teacher had given her, set out\nfor Miss Myrover's home.\n\nShe went round to the side gate--the house stood on a corner--and stole\nup the path to the kitchen. A colored woman, whom she did not know, came\nto the door.\n\n\"W'at yer want, chile?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Kin I see Miss Ma'y?\" asked Sophy timidly.\n\n\"I don' know, honey. Ole Miss Myrover say she don' want no cullud folks\nroun' de house endyoin' dis fun'al. I'll look an' see if she's roun' de\nfront room, whar de co'pse is. You sed-down heah an' keep still, an' ef\nshe's upstairs maybe I kin git yer in dere a minute. Ef I can't, I kin\nput yo' bokay 'mongs' de res', whar she won't know nuthin' erbout it.\"\n\nA moment after she had gone there was a step in the hall, and old Mrs.\nMyrover came into the kitchen.\n\n\"Dinah!\" she said in a peevish tone. \"Dinah!\"\n\nReceiving no answer, Mrs. Myrover peered around the kitchen, and caught\nsight of Sophy.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" she demanded.\n\n\"I--I'm-m waitin' ter see de cook, ma'am,\" stammered Sophy.\n\n\"The cook isn't here now. I don't know where she is. Besides, my\ndaughter is to be buried to-day, and I won't have any one visiting the\nservants until the funeral is over. Come back some other day, or see the\ncook at her own home in the evening.\"\n\nShe stood waiting for the child to go, and under the keen glance of her\neyes Sophy, feeling as though she had been caught in some disgraceful\nact, hurried down the walk and out of the gate, with her bouquet in her\nhand.\n\n\"Dinah,\" said Mrs. Myrover, when the cook came back, \"I don't want\nany strange people admitted here to-day. The house will be full of our\nfriends, and we have no room for others.\"\n\n\"Yas'm,\" said the cook. She understood perfectly what her mistress\nmeant; and what the cook thought about her mistress was a matter of no\nconsequence.\n\nThe funeral services were held at St. John's Episcopal Church, where the\nMyrovers had always worshiped. Quite a number of Miss Myrover's pupils\nwent to the church to attend the services. The church was not a large\none. There was a small gallery at the rear, to which colored people were\nadmitted, if they chose to come, at ordinary services; and those who\nwished to be present at the funeral supposed that the usual custom\nwould prevail. They were therefore surprised, when they went to the side\nentrance, by which colored people gained access to the gallery stairs,\nto be met by an usher who barred their passage.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"but I have had orders to admit no one until the\nfriends of the family have all been seated. If you wish to wait until\nthe white people have all gone in, and there's any room left, you may\nbe able to get into the back part of the gallery. Of course I can't tell\nyet whether there'll be any room or not.\"\n\nNow the statement of the usher was a very reasonable one; but, strange\nto say, none of the colored people chose to remain except Sophy. She\nstill hoped to use her floral offering for its destined end, in some\nway, though she did not know just how. She waited in the yard until the\nchurch was filled with white people, and a number who could not gain\nadmittance were standing about the doors. Then she went round to the\nside of the church, and, depositing her bouquet carefully on an old\nmossy gravestone, climbed up on the projecting sill of a window near the\nchancel. The window was of stained glass, of somewhat ancient make. The\nchurch was old, had indeed been built in colonial times, and the stained\nglass had been brought from England. The design of the window showed\nJesus blessing little children. Time had dealt gently with the window;\nbut just at the feet of the figure of Jesus a small triangular piece of\nglass had been broken out. To this aperture Sophy applied her eyes, and\nthrough it saw and heard what she could of the services within.\n\nBefore the chancel, on trestles draped in black, stood the sombre casket\nin which lay all that was mortal of her dear teacher. The top of the\ncasket was covered with flowers; and lying stretched out underneath it\nshe saw Miss Myrover's little white dog, Prince. He had followed the\nbody to the church, and, slipping in unnoticed among the mourners, had\ntaken his place, from which no one had the heart to remove him.\n\nThe white-robed rector read the solemn service for the dead, and then\ndelivered a brief address, in which he spoke of the uncertainty of life,\nand, to the believer, the certain blessedness of eternity. He spoke of\nMiss Myrover's kindly spirit, and, as an illustration of her love and\nself-sacrifice for others, referred to her labors as a teacher of the\npoor ignorant negroes who had been placed in their midst by an all-wise\nProvidence, and whom it was their duty to guide and direct in the\nstation in which God had put them. Then the organ pealed, a prayer was\nsaid, and the long cortege moved from the church to the cemetery, about\nhalf a mile away, where the body was to be interred.\n\nWhen the services were over, Sophy sprang down from her perch, and,\ntaking her flowers, followed the procession. She did not walk with the\nrest, but at a proper and respectful distance from the last mourner. No\none noticed the little black girl with the bunch of yellow flowers, or\nthought of her as interested in the funeral.\n\nThe cortege reached the cemetery and filed slowly through the gate; but\nSophy stood outside, looking at a small sign in white letters on a black\nbackground:--\n\n\"NOTICE. This cemetery is for white people only. Others please keep\nout.\"\n\nSophy, thanks to Miss Myrover's painstaking instruction, could read this\nsign very distinctly. In fact, she had often read it before. For Sophy\nwas a child who loved beauty, in a blind, groping sort of way, and had\nsometimes stood by the fence of the cemetery and looked through at the\ngreen mounds and shaded walks and blooming flowers within, and wished\nthat she could walk among them. She knew, too, that the little sign on\nthe gate, though so courteously worded, was no mere formality; for she\nhad heard how a colored man, who had wandered into the cemetery on a hot\nnight and fallen asleep on the flat top of a tomb, had been arrested\nas a vagrant and fined five dollars, which he had worked out on the\nstreets, with a ball-and-chain attachment, at twenty-five cents a day.\nSince that time the cemetery gate had been locked at night.\n\nSo Sophy stayed outside, and looked through the fence. Her poor bouquet\nhad begun to droop by this time, and the yellow ribbon had lost some\nof its freshness. Sophy could see the rector standing by the grave, the\nmourners gathered round; she could faintly distinguish the solemn words\nwith which ashes were committed to ashes, and dust to dust. She heard\nthe hollow thud of the earth falling on the coffin; and she leaned\nagainst the iron fence, sobbing softly, until the grave was filled and\nrounded off, and the wreaths and other floral pieces were disposed upon\nit. When the mourners began to move toward the gate, Sophy walked slowly\ndown the street, in a direction opposite to that taken by most of the\npeople who came out.\n\nWhen they had all gone away, and the sexton had come out and locked the\ngate behind him, Sophy crept back. Her roses were faded now, and from\nsome of them the petals had fallen. She stood there irresolute, loath to\nleave with her heart's desire unsatisfied, when, as her eyes fell upon\nthe teacher's last resting place, she saw lying beside the new-made\ngrave what looked like a small bundle of white wool. Sophy's eyes\nlighted up with a sudden glow.\n\n\"Prince! Here, Prince!\" she called.\n\nThe little dog rose, and trotted down to the gate. Sophy pushed the poor\nbouquet between the iron bars. \"Take that ter Miss Ma'y, Prince,\" she\nsaid, \"that's a good doggie.\"\n\nThe dog wagged his tail intelligently, took the bouquet carefully in his\nmouth, carried it to his mistress's grave, and laid it among the other\nflowers. The bunch of roses was so small that from where she stood Sophy\ncould see only a dash of yellow against the white background of the mass\nof flowers.\n\nWhen Prince had performed his mission he turned his eyes toward Sophy\ninquiringly, and when she gave him a nod of approval lay down and\nresumed his watch by the graveside. Sophy looked at him a moment with a\nfeeling very much like envy, and then turned and moved slowly away.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CASE OF THE NEGRO by Booker T. Washington\n\n\nAll attempts to settle the question of the Negro in the South by his\nremoval from this country have so far failed, and I think that they are\nlikely to fail. The next census will probably show that we have nearly\nten million black people in the United States, about eight millions of\nwhom are in the Southern states. In fact, we have almost a nation\nwithin a nation. The Negro population in the United States lacks but\ntwo millions of being as large as the whole population of Mexico, and\nis nearly twice as large as that of Canada. Our black people equal\nin number the combined populations of Switzerland, Greece, Honduras,\nNicaragua, Cuba, Uraguay [sic], Santo Domingo, Paraguay, and Costa Rica.\nWhen we consider, in connection with these facts, that the race has\ndoubled itself since its freedom, and is still increasing, it hardly\nseems possible for any one to take seriously any scheme of emigration\nfrom America as a method of solution. At most, even if the government\nwere to provide the means, but a few hundred thousand could be\ntransported each year. The yearly increase in population would more than\nlikely overbalance the number transported. Even if it did not, the time\nrequired to get rid of the Negro by this method would perhaps be fifty\nor seventy-five years.\n\nSome have advised that the Negro leave the South, and take up his\nresidence in the Northern states. I question whether this would make him\nany better off than he is in the South, when all things are considered.\nIt has been my privilege to study the condition of our people in nearly\nevery part of America; and I say without hesitation that, with some\nexceptional cases, the Negro is at his best in the Southern states.\nWhile he enjoys certain privileges in the North that he does not have\nin the South, when it comes to the matter of securing property, enjoying\nbusiness advantages and employment, the South presents a far better\nopportunity than the North. Few colored men from the South are as yet\nable to stand up against the severe and increasing competition that\nexists in the North, to say nothing of the unfriendly influence of labor\norganizations, which in some way prevents black men in the North, as a\nrule, from securing occupation in the line of skilled labor.\n\nAnother point of great danger for the colored man who goes North is the\nmatter of morals, owing to the numerous temptations by which he finds\nhimself surrounded. More ways offer in which he can spend money than in\nthe South, but fewer avenues of employment for earning money are open to\nhim. The fact that at the North the Negro is almost confined to one line\nof occupation often tends to discourage and demoralize the strongest\nwho go from the South, and makes them an easy prey for temptation. A few\nyears ago, I made an examination into the condition of a settlement\nof Negroes who left the South and went into Kansas about twenty years\nsince, when there was a good deal of excitement in the South concerning\nemigration from the West, and found it much below the standard of that\nof similar communities in the South. The only conclusion which any one\ncan reach, from this and like instances, is that the Negroes are to\nremain in the Southern states. As a race they do not want to leave the\nSouth, and the Southern white people do not want them to leave. We must\ntherefore find some basis of settlement that will be constitutional,\njust, manly; that will be fair to both races in the South and to the\nwhole country. This cannot be done in a day, a year, or any short\nperiod of time. We can, however, with the present light, decide upon a\nreasonably safe method of solving the problem, and turn our strength\nand effort in that direction. In doing this, I would not have the Negro\ndeprived of any privilege guaranteed to him by the Constitution of the\nUnited States. It is not best for the Negro that he relinquish any of\nhis constitutional rights; it is not best for the Southern white man\nthat he should, as I shall attempt to show in this article.\n\nIn order that we may concentrate our forces upon a wise object, without\nloss of time or effort, I want to suggest what seems to me and many\nothers the wisest policy to be pursued. I have reached these conclusions\nnot only by reason of my own observations and experience, but after\neighteen years of direct contact with leading and influential colored\nand white men in most parts of our country. But I wish first to mention\nsome elements of danger in the present situation, which all who desire\nthe permanent welfare of both races in the South should carefully take\ninto account.\n\nFirst. There is danger that a certain class of impatient extremists\namong the Negroes in the North, who have little knowledge of the actual\nconditions in the South, may do the entire race injury by attempting to\nadvise their brethren in the South to resort to armed resistance or\nthe use of the torch, in order to secure justice. All intelligent and\nwell-considered discussion of any important question, or condemnation of\nany wrong, whether in the North or the South, from the public\nplatform and through the press, is to be commended and encouraged; but\nill-considered and incendiary utterances from black men in the North\nwill tend to add to the burdens of our people in the South rather than\nto relieve them. We must not fall into the temptation of believing that\nwe can raise ourselves by abusing some one else.\n\nSecond. Another danger in the South which should be guarded against\nis that the whole white South, including the wise, conservative,\nlaw-abiding element, may find itself represented before the bar of\npublic opinion by the mob or lawless element, which gives expression\nto its feelings and tendency in a manner that advertises the South\nthroughout the world; while too often those who have no sympathy\nwith such disregard of law are either silent, or fail to speak in\na sufficiently emphatic manner to offset in any large degree the\nunfortunate reputation which the lawless have made for many portions of\nthe South.\n\nThird. No race or people ever got upon its feet without severe and\nconstant struggle, often in the face of the greatest discouragement.\nWhile passing through the present trying period of its history, there\nis danger that a large and valuable element of the Negro race may\nbecome discouraged in the effort to better its condition. Every possible\ninfluence should be exerted to prevent this.\n\nFourth. There is a possibility that harm may be done to the South and to\nthe Negro by exaggerated newspaper articles which are written near the\nscene or in the midst of specially aggravating occurrences. Often these\nreports are written by newspaper men, who give the impression that there\nis a race conflict throughout the South, and that all Southern white\npeople are opposed to the Negro's progress; overlooking the fact that\nthough in some sections there is trouble, in most parts of the South,\nif matters are not yet in all respects as we would have them, there\nis nevertheless a very large measure of peace, good will, and mutual\nhelpfulness. In the same relation, much can be done to retard the\nprogress of the Negro by a certain class of Southern white people, who\nin the midst of excitement speak or write in a manner that gives the\nimpression that all Negroes are lawless, untrustworthy, and shiftless.\nFor example, a Southern writer said, not long ago, in a communication\nto the New York Independent: \"Even in small towns the husband cannot\nventure to leave his wife alone for an hour at night. At no time, in no\nplace, is the white woman safe from the insults and assaults of these\ncreatures.\" These statements, I presume, represented the feelings\nand the conditions that existed, at the time of the writing, in one\ncommunity or county in the South; but thousands of Southern white men\nand women would be ready to testify that this is not the condition\nthroughout the South, nor throughout any Southern state.\n\nFifth. Owing to the lack of school opportunities for the Negro in\nthe rural districts of the South, there is danger that ignorance\nand idleness may increase to the extent of giving the Negro race a\nreputation for crime, and that immorality may eat its way into the fibre\nof the race so as to retard its progress for many years. In judging the\nNegro we must not be too harsh. We must remember that it has been only\nwithin the last thirty-four years that the black father and mother have\nhad the responsibility, and consequently the experience, of training\ntheir own children. That perfection has not been reached in one\ngeneration, with the obstacles that the parents have been compelled to\novercome, is not to be wondered at.\n\nSixth. Finally, I would mention my fear that some of the white people of\nthe South may be led to feel that the way to settle the race problem is\nto repress the aspirations of the Negro by legislation of a kind that\nconfers certain legal or political privileges upon an ignorant and\npoor white man, and withholds the same privileges from a black man in a\nsimilar condition. Such legislation injures and retards the progress of\nboth races. It is an injustice to the poor white man, because it takes\nfrom him incentive to secure education and property as prerequisites\nfor voting. He feels that because he is a white man, regardless of his\npossessions, a way will be found for him to vote. I would label all such\nmeasures \"laws to keep the poor white man in ignorance and poverty.\"\n\nThe Talladega News Reporter, a Democratic newspaper of Alabama, recently\nsaid: \"But it is a weak cry when the white man asks odds on intelligence\nover the Negro. When nature has already so handicapped the African in\nthe race for knowledge, the cry of the boasted Anglo-Saxon for still\nfurther odds seems babyish. What wonder that the world looks on in\nsurprise, if not disgust? It cannot help but say, If our contention be\ntrue that the Negro is an inferior race, then the odds ought to be on\nthe other side, if any are to be given. And why not? No; the thing to\ndo--the only thing that will stand the test of time--is to do right,\nexactly right, let come what will. And that right thing, as it seems\nto us, is to place a fair educational qualification before every\ncitizen,--one that is self-testing, and not dependent on the wishes of\nweak men,--letting all who pass the test stand in the proud ranks\nof American voters, whose votes shall be counted as cast, and whose\nsovereign will shall be maintained as law by all the powers that be.\nNothing short of this will do. Every exemption, on whatsoever ground, is\nan outrage that can only rob some legitimate voter of his rights.\"\n\nSuch laws have been made,--in Mississippi, for example,--with the\n\"understanding\" clause, hold out a temptation for the election officer\nto perjure and degrade himself by too often deciding that the ignorant\nwhite man does understand the Constitution when it is read to him, and\nthat the ignorant black man does not. By such a law, the state not only\ncommits a wrong against its black citizens; it injures the morals of\nits white citizens by conferring such a power upon any white man who may\nhappen to be a judge of elections.\n\nSuch laws are hurtful, again, because they keep alive in the heart of\nthe black man the feeling that the white man means to oppress him. The\nonly safe way out is to set a high standard as a test of citizenship,\nand require blacks and whites alike to come up to it. When this is done,\nboth will have a higher respect for the election laws, and for those who\nmake them. I do not believe that, with his centuries of advantage\nover the Negro in the opportunity to acquire property and education as\nprerequisites for voting, the average white man in the South desires\nthat any special law be passed to give him further advantage over one\nwho has had but a little more than thirty years in which to prepare\nhimself for citizenship. In this relation, another point of danger is\nthat the Negro has been made to feel that it is his duty continually\nto oppose the Southern white man in politics, even in matters where no\nprinciple is involved; and that he is only loyal to his own race and\nacting in a manly way in thus opposing the white man. Such a policy has\nproved very hurtful to both races. Where it is a matter of principle,\nwhere a question of right or wrong is involved, I would advise the\nNegro to stand by principle at all hazards. A Southern white man has no\nrespect for or confidence in a Negro who acts merely for policy's sake;\nbut there are many cases, and the number is growing, where the Negro has\nnothing to gain, and much to lose, by opposing the Southern white man in\nmatters that relate to government.\n\nUnder the foregoing six heads I believe I have stated some of the main\npoints which, all high-minded white men and black men, North and South,\nwill agree, need our most earnest and thoughtful consideration, if we\nwould hasten, and not hinder, the progress of our country.\n\nNow as to the policy that should be pursued. On this subject I claim to\npossess no superior wisdom or unusual insight. I may be wrong; I may be\nin some degree right.\n\nIn the future we want to impress upon the Negro, more than we have done\nin the past, the importance of identifying himself more closely with the\ninterests of the South; of making himself part of the South, and at home\nin it. Heretofore, for reasons which were natural, and for which no one\nis especially to blame, the colored people have been too much like a\nforeign nation residing in the midst of another nation. If William Lloyd\nGarrison, Wendell Phillips, or George L. Stearns were alive to-day, I\nfeel sure that he would advise the Negroes to identify their interests\nas closely as possible with those of their white neighbors,--always\nunderstanding that no question of right and wrong is involved. In\nno other way, it seems to me, can we get a foundation for peace and\nprogress. He who advises against this policy will advise the Negro to\ndo that which no people in history, who have succeeded, have done. The\nwhite man, North or South, who advises the Negro against it advises him\nto do that which he himself has not done. The bed rock upon which every\nindividual rests his chances for success in life is the friendship,\nthe confidence, the respect, of his next-door neighbor in the little\ncommunity in which he lives. The problem of the Negro in the South turns\non whether he can make himself of such indispensable service to his\nneighbor and the community that no one can fill his place better in the\nbody politic. There is at present no other safe course for the black man\nto pursue. If the Negro in the South has a friend in his white neighbor,\nand a still larger number of friends in his own community, he has a\nprotection and a guarantee of his rights that will be more potent and\nmore lasting than any our Federal Congress or any outside power can\nconfer.\n\nThe London Times, in a recent editorial discussing affairs in the\nTransvaal, where Englishmen have been denied certain privileges by the\nBoers, says: \"England is too sagacious not to prefer a gradual reform\nfrom within, even should it be less rapid than most of us might wish, to\nthe most sweeping redress of grievances imposed from without. Our object\nis to obtain fair play for the Outlanders, but the best way to do it\nis to enable them to help themselves.\" This policy, I think, is equally\nsafe when applied to conditions in the South. The foreigner who comes to\nAmerica identifies himself as soon as possible, in business, education,\nand politics, with the community in which he settles. We have a\nconspicuous example of this in the case of the Jews, who in the South,\nas well as in other parts of our country, have not always been justly\ntreated; but the Jews have so woven themselves into the business and\npatriotic interests of the communities in which they live, have made\nthemselves so valuable as citizens, that they have won a place in the\nSouth which they could have obtained in no other way. The Negro in Cuba\nhas practically settled the race question there, because he has made\nhimself a part of Cuba in thought and action.\n\nWhat I have tried to indicate cannot be accomplished by any sudden\nrevolution of methods, but it does seem that the tendency should be\nmore and more in this direction. Let me emphasize this by a practical\nexample. The North sends thousands of dollars into the South every year\nfor the education of the Negro. The teachers in most of the Southern\nschools supported by the North are Northern men and women of the highest\nChristian culture and most unselfish devotion. The Negro owes them\na debt of gratitude which can never be paid. The various missionary\nsocieties in the North have done a work which to a large degree has\nproved the salvation of the South, and the results of it will appear\nmore in future generations than in this. We have now reached the point,\nin the South, where, I believe, great good could be accomplished in\nchanging the attitude of the white people toward the Negro, and of\nthe Negro toward the whites, if a few Southern white teachers, of high\ncharacter, would take an active interest in the work of our higher\nschools. Can this be done? Yes. The medical school connected with\nShaw University at Raleigh, North Carolina, has from the first had as\ninstructors and professors almost exclusively Southern white doctors who\nreside in Raleigh, and they have given the highest satisfaction. This\ngives the people of Raleigh the feeling that the school is theirs, and\nnot something located in, but not a part of, the South. In Augusta,\nGeorgia, the Payne Institute, one of the best colleges for our people,\nis officered and taught almost wholly by Southern white men and women.\nThe Presbyterian Theological School at Tuscaloosa, Alabama, has only\nSouthern white men as instructors. Some time ago, at the Calhoun School\nin Alabama, one of the leading white men in the county was given an\nimportant position; since then the feeling of the white people in the\ncounty has greatly changed toward the school.\n\nWe must admit the stern fact that at present the Negro, through no\nchoice of his own, is living in the midst of another race, which is far\nahead of him in education, property, and experience; and further, that\nthe Negro's present condition makes him dependent upon the white people\nfor most of the things necessary to sustain life, as well as, in a large\nmeasure, for his education. In all history, those who have possessed\nthe property and intelligence have exercised the greatest control in\ngovernment, regardless of color, race, or geographical location. This\nbeing the case, how can the black man in the South improve his estate?\nAnd does the Southern white man want him to improve it? The latter part\nof this question I shall attempt to answer later in this article.\n\nThe Negro in the South has it within his power, if he properly utilizes\nthe forces at land, to make of himself such a valuable factor in the\nlife of the South that for the most part he need not seek privileges,\nbut they will be conferred upon him. To bring this about, the Negro must\nbegin at the bottom and lay a sure foundation, and not be lured by any\ntemptation into trying to rise on a false footing. While the Negro is\nlaying this foundation, he will need help and sympathy and justice\nfrom the law. Progress by any other method will be but temporary\nand superficial, and the end of it will be worse than the beginning.\nAmerican slavery was a great curse to both races, and I should be the\nlast to apologize for it; but in the providence of God I believe that\nslavery laid the foundation for the solution of the problem that is now\nbefore us in the South. Under slavery, the Negro was taught every trade,\nevery industry, that furnishes the means of earning a living. Now if\non this foundation, laid in a rather crude way, it is true, but a\nfoundation nevertheless, we can gradually grow and improve, the future\nfor us is bright. Let me be more specific. Agriculture is or has been\nthe basic industry of nearly every race or nation that has succeeded.\nThe Negro got a knowledge of this under slavery: hence in a large\nmeasure he is in possession of this industry in the South to-day. Taking\nthe whole South, I should say that eighty per cent of the Negroes live\nby agriculture in some form, though it is often a very primitive and\ncrude form. The Negro can buy land in the South, as a rule, wherever the\nwhite man can buy it, and at very low prices. Now, since the bulk of our\npeople already have a foundation in agriculture, are at their best when\nliving in the country engaged in agricultural pursuits, plainly,\nthe best thing, the logical thing, is to turn the larger part of our\nstrength in a direction that will put the Negroes among the most\nskilled agricultural people in the world. The man who has learned to do\nsomething better than any one else, has learned to do a common thing\nin an uncommon manner, has power and influence which no adverse\nsurroundings can take from him. It is better to show a man how to make a\nplace for himself than to put him in one that some one else has made\nfor him. The Negro who can make himself so conspicuous as a successful\nfarmer, a large taxpayer, a wise helper of his fellow men, as to be\nplaced in a position of trust and honor by natural selection, whether\nthe position be political or not, is a hundredfold more secure in that\nposition than one placed there by mere outside force or pressure. I know\na Negro, Hon. Isaiah T. Montgomery, in Mississippi, who is mayor of a\ntown; it is true that the town is composed almost wholly of Negroes.\nMr. Montgomery is mayor of this town because his genius, thrift, and\nforesight have created it; and he is held and supported in his office\nby a charter granted by the state of Mississippi, and by the vote and\npublic sentiment of the community in which he lives.\n\nLet us help the Negro by every means possible to acquire such an\neducation in farming, dairying, stock-raising, horticulture, etc., as\nwill place him near the top in these industries, and the race problem\nwill in a large part be settled, or at least stripped of many of its\nmost perplexing elements. This policy would also tend to keep the Negro\nin the country and smaller towns, where he succeeds best, and stop the\ninflux into the large cities, where he does not succeed so well. The\nrace, like the individual, which produces something of superior worth\nthat has a common human interest, wins a permanent place, and is bound\nto be recognized.\n\nAt a county fair in the South, not long ago, I saw a Negro awarded the\nfirst prize, by a jury of white men, over white competitors, for the\nproduction of the best specimen of Indian corn. Every white man at the\nfair seemed to be proud of the achievement of the Negro, because it was\napparent that he had done something that would add to the wealth and\ncomfort of the people of both races in that county. At the Tuskegee\nNormal and Industrial Institute, in Alabama, we have a department\ndevoted to training men along the lines of agriculture that I have\nnamed; but what we are doing is small when compared with what should be\ndone in Tuskegee, and at other educational centres. In a material sense\nthe South is still an undeveloped country. While in some other affairs\nrace prejudice is strongly marked, in the matter of business, of\ncommercial and industrial development, there are few obstacles in the\nNegro's way. A Negro who produces or has for sale something that the\ncommunity wants finds customers among white people as well as black.\nUpon equal security, a Negro can borrow money at the bank as readily as\na white man can. A bank in Birmingham, Alabama, which has existed ten\nyears, is officered and controlled wholly by Negroes. This bank has\nwhite borrowers and white depositors. A graduate of the Tuskegee\nInstitute keeps a well-appointed grocery store in Tuskegee, and he tells\nme that he sells about as many goods to one race as to the other. What\nI have said of the opening that awaits the Negro in the business of\nagriculture is almost equally true of mechanics, manufacturing, and all\nthe domestic arts. The field is before him and right about him. Will\nhe seize upon it? Will he \"cast down his bucket where he is\"? Will his\nfriends, North and South, encourage him and prepare him to occupy\nit? Every city in the South, for example, would give support to a\nfirst-class architect or housebuilder or contractor of our race. The\narchitect or contractor would not only receive support, but through\nhis example numbers of young colored men would learn such trades as\ncarpentry, brickmasonry, plastering, painting, etc., and the race would\nbe put into a position to hold on to many of the industries which it\nis now in danger of losing, because in too many cases brain, skill, and\ndignity are not imparted to the common occupations. Any individual or\nrace that does not fit itself to occupy in the best manner the field or\nservice that is right about it will sooner or later be asked to move on\nand let another take it.\n\nBut I may be asked, Would you confine the Negro to agriculture,\nmechanics, the domestic arts, etc.? Not at all; but just now and for a\nnumber of years the stress should be laid along the lines that I have\nmentioned. We shall need and must have many teachers and ministers, some\ndoctors and lawyers and statesmen, but these professional men will\nhave a constituency or a foundation from which to draw support just in\nproportion as the race prospers along the economic lines that I have\npointed out. During the first fifty or one hundred years of the life of\nany people, are not the economic occupations always given the greater\nattention? This is not only the historic, but, I think, the common-sense\nview. If this generation will lay the material foundation, it will be\nthe quickest and surest way for enabling later generations to succeed in\nthe cultivation of the fine arts, and to surround themselves with some\nof the luxuries of life, if desired. What the race most needs now, in my\nopinion, is a whole army of men and women well-trained to lead, and\nat the same time devote themselves to agriculture, mechanics, domestic\nemployment, and business. As to the mental training that these educated\nleaders should be equipped with, I should say, give them all the\nmental training and culture that the circumstances of individuals will\nallow,--the more the better. No race can permanently succeed until its\nmind is awakened and strengthened by the ripest thought. But I would\nconstantly have it kept in the minds of those who are educated in books\nthat a large proportion of those who are educated should be so trained\nin hand that they can bring this mental strength and knowledge to\nbear upon the physical conditions in the South, which I have tried to\nemphasize.\n\nFrederick Douglass, of sainted memory, once, in addressing his race,\nused these words: \"We are to prove that we can better our own condition.\nOne way to do this is to accumulate property. This may sound to you like\na new gospel. You have been accustomed to hear that money is the root of\nall evil, etc.; on the other hand, property, money, if you please, will\npurchase for us the only condition by which any people can rise to\nthe dignity of genuine manhood; for without property there can be no\nleisure, without leisure there can be no thought, without thought there\ncan be no invention, without invention there can be no progress.\"\n\nThe Negro should be taught that material development is not an end, but\nmerely a means to an end. As professor W. E. B. Du Bois puts it, the\nidea should not be simply to make men carpenters, but to make carpenters\nmen. The Negro has a highly religious temperament; but what he needs\nmore and more is to be convinced of the importance of weaving his\nreligion and morality into the practical affairs of daily life. Equally\ndoes he need to be taught to put so much intelligence into his labor\nthat he will see dignity and beauty in the occupation, and love it for\nits own sake. The Negro needs to be taught to apply more of the\nreligion that manifests itself in his happiness in prayer meeting to the\nperformance of his daily task. The man who owns a home, and is in the\npossession of the elements by which he is sure of a daily living, has a\ngreat aid to a moral and religious life. What bearing will all this have\nupon the Negro's place in the South, as a citizen and in the enjoyment\nof the privileges which our government confers?\n\nTo state in detail just what place the black man will occupy in the\nSouth as a citizen, when he has developed in the direction named, is\nbeyond the wisdom of any one. Much will depend upon the sense of justice\nwhich can be kept alive in the breast of the American people; almost\nas much will depend upon the good sense of the Negro himself. That\nquestion, I confess, does not give me the most concern just now. The\nimportant and pressing question is, Will the Negro, with his own help\nand that of his friends, take advantage of the opportunities that\nsurround him? When he has done this, I believe, speaking of his future\nin general terms, that he will be treated with justice, be given the\nprotection of the law and the recognition which his usefulness and\nability warrant. If, fifty years ago, one had predicted that the Negro\nwould receive the recognition and honor which individuals have already\nreceived, he would have been laughed at as an idle dreamer. Time,\npatience, and constant achievement are great factors in the rise of a\nrace.\n\nI do not believe that the world ever takes a race seriously, in its\ndesire to share in the government of a nation, until a large number of\nindividual members of that race have demonstrated beyond question their\nability to control and develop their own business enterprises. Once a\nnumber of Negroes rise to the point where they own and operate the most\nsuccessful farms, are among the largest taxpayers in their county, are\nmoral and intelligent, I do not believe that in many portions of the\nSouth such men need long be denied the right of saying by their votes\nhow they prefer their property to be taxed, and who are to make and\nadminister the laws.\n\nI was walking the street of a certain town in the South lately in\ncompany with the most prominent Negro there. While we were together, the\nmayor of the town sought out the black man, and said, \"Next week we are\ngoing to vote on the question of issuing bonds to secure water-works;\nyou must be sure to vote on the day of election.\" The mayor did not\nsuggest whether he should vote yes or no; but he knew that the very fact\nof this Negro's owning nearly a block of the most valuable property in\nthe town was a guarantee that he would cast a safe, wise vote on this\nimportant proposition. The white man knew that because of this Negro's\nproperty interests he would cast his vote in the way he thought would\nbenefit every white and black citizen in the town, and not be controlled\nby influences a thousand miles away. But a short time ago I read letters\nfrom nearly every prominent white man in Birmingham, Alabama, asking\nthat the Rev. W. R. Pettiford, a Negro, be appointed to a certain\nimportant federal office. What is the explanation of this? For nine\nyears Mr. Pettiford has been the president of the Negro bank in\nBirmingham, to which I have alluded. During these nine years, the white\ncitizens have had the opportunity of seeing that Mr. Pettiford can\nmanage successfully a private business, and that he has proved himself a\nconservative, thoughtful citizen, and they are willing to trust him in a\npublic office. Such individual examples will have to be multiplied, till\nthey become more nearly the rule than the exception they now are. While\nwe are multiplying these examples, the Negro must keep a strong and\ncourageous heart. He cannot improve his condition by any short-cut\ncourse or by artificial methods. Above all, he must not be deluded\ninto believing that his condition can be permanently bettered by a mere\nbattledoor [sic] and shuttlecock of words, or by any process of mere\nmental gymnastics or oratory. What is desired along with a logical\ndefense of his cause are deeds, results,--continued results, in the\ndirection of building himself up, so as to leave no doubt in the mind of\nany one of his ability to succeed.\n\nAn important question often asked is, Does the white man in the South\nwant the Negro to improve his present condition? I say yes. From the\nMontgomery (Alabama) Daily Advertiser I clip the following in reference\nto the closing of a colored school in a town in Alabama:--\n\n\"EUFALA, May 25, 1899. The closing exercises of the city colored public\nschool were held at St. Luke's A. M. E. Church last night, and were\nwitnessed by a large gathering, including many whites. The recitations\nby the pupils were excellent, and the music was also an interesting\nfeature. Rev. R. T. Pollard delivered the address, which was quite an\nable one, and the certificates were presented by Professor T. L. McCoy,\nwhite, of the Sanford Street School. The success of the exercises\nreflects great credit on Professor S. M. Murphy, the principal, who\nenjoys a deserved good reputation as a capable and efficient educator.\"\n\nI quote this report, not because it is the exception, but because such\nmarks of interest in the education of the Negro on the part of the\nSouthern white people may be seen almost every day in the local\npapers. Why should white people, by their presence, words, and actions,\nencourage the black man to get education, if they do not desire him to\nimprove his condition?\n\nThe Payne Institute, an excellent college, to which I have already\nreferred, is supported almost wholly by the Southern white Methodist\nchurch. The Southern white Presbyterians support a theological school\nfor Negroes at Tuscaloosa. For a number of years the Southern white\nBaptists have contributed toward Negro education. Other denominations\nhave done the same. If these people do not want the Negro educated to a\nhigher standard, there is no reason why they should pretend they do.\n\nThough some of the lynchings in the South have indicated a barbarous\nfeeling toward Negroes, Southern white men here and there, as well as\nnewspapers, have spoken out strongly against lynching. I quote from the\naddress of the Rev. Mr. Vance, of Nashville, Tennessee, delivered before\nthe National Sunday School Union, in Atlanta, not long since, as an\nexample:--\n\n\"And yet, as I stand here to-night, a Southerner speaking for my section\nand addressing an audience from all sections, there is one foul blot\nupon the fair fame of the South, at the bare mention of which the heart\nturns sick and the cheek is crimsoned with shame. I want to lift my\nvoice to-night in loud and long and indignant protest against the awful\nhorror of mob violence, which the other day reached the climax of its\nmadness and infamy in a deed as black and brutal and barbarous as can be\nfound in the annals of human crime.\n\n\"I have a right to speak on the subject, and I propose to be heard.\nThe time has come for every lover of the South to set the might of an\nangered and resolute manhood against the shame and peril of the lynch\ndemon. These people whose fiendish glee taunts their victim as his flesh\ncrackles in the flames do not represent the South. I have not a syllable\nof apology for the sickening crime they meant to avenge. But it is high\ntime we were learning that lawlessness is no remedy for crime. For one,\nI dare to believe that the people of my section are able to cope with\ncrime, however treacherous and defiant, through their courts of justice;\nand I plead for the masterful sway of a righteous and exalted public\nsentiment that shall class lynch law in the category with crime.\"\n\nIt is a notable and encouraging fact that no Negro educated in any of\nour larger institutions of learning in the South has been charged with\nany of the recent crimes connected with assaults upon women.\n\nIf we go on making progress in the directions that I have tried to\nindicate, more and more the South will be drawn to one course. As I have\nalready said, it is not to the best interests of the white race of the\nSouth that the Negro be deprived of any privilege guaranteed him by\nthe Constitution of the United States. This would put upon the South a\nburden under which no government could stand and prosper. Every article\nin our Federal Constitution was placed there with a view of stimulating\nand encouraging the highest type of citizenship. To continue to tax\nthe Negro without giving him the right to vote, as fast as he qualifies\nhimself in education and property for voting, would insure the\nalienation of the affections of the Negro from the state in which\nhe lives, and would be the reversal of the fundamental principles of\ngovernment for which our states have stood. In other ways than this\nthe injury would be as great to the white man as to the Negro. Taxation\nwithout the hope of becoming voters would take away from one third of\nthe citizens of the Gulf states their interest in government, and a\nstimulus to become taxpayers or to secure education, and thus be able\nand willing to bear their share of the cost of education and government,\nwhich now rests so heavily upon the white taxpayers of the South. The\nmore the Negro is stimulated and encouraged, the sooner will he be able\nto bear a larger share of the burdens of the South. We have recently had\nbefore us an example, in the case of Spain, of a government that left a\nlarge portion of its citizens in ignorance, and neglected their highest\ninterests.\n\nAs I have said elsewhere: \"There is no escape, through law of man or\nGod, from the inevitable.\n\n\n   'The laws of changeless justice bind\n    Oppressor with oppressed;\n   And close as sin and suffering joined\n    We march to fate abreast.'\n\n\nNearly sixteen millions of hands will aid you in pulling the load\nupwards, or they will pull the load downwards against you. We shall\nconstitute one third and more of the ignorance and crime of the South,\nor one third of its intelligence and progress; we shall contribute one\nthird to the business and industrial prosperity of the South, or we\nshall prove a veritable body of death, stagnating, depressing, retarding\nevery effort to advance the body politic.\"\n\nMy own feeling is that the South will gradually reach the point where\nit will see the wisdom and the justice of enacting an educational or\nproperty qualification, or both, for voting, that shall be made to\napply honestly to both races. The industrial development of the Negro\nin connection with education and Christian character will help to hasten\nthis end. When this is done, we shall have a foundation, in my opinion,\nupon which to build a government that is honest, and that will be in a\nhigh degree satisfactory to both races.\n\nI do not suffer myself to take too optimistic a view of the conditions\nin the South. The problem is a large and serious one, and will require\nthe patient help, sympathy, and advice of our most patriotic citizens,\nNorth and South, for years to come. But I believe that if the principles\nwhich I have tried to indicate are followed, a solution of the question\nwill come. So long as the Negro is permitted to get education, acquire\nproperty, and secure employment, and is treated with respect in the\nbusiness world, as is now true in the greater part of the South, I\nshall have the greatest faith in his working out his own destiny in our\nSouthern states. The education and preparation for citizenship of\nnearly eight millions of people is a tremendous task, and every lover\nof humanity should count it a privilege to help in the solution of a\nproblem for which our whole country is responsible.\n\n\n\n\nHOT-FOOT HANNIBAL by Charles W. Chesnutt\n\n\n\"I hate and despise you! I wish never to see you or speak to you again!\"\n\n\"Very well; I will take care that henceforth you have no opportunity to\ndo either.\"\n\nThese words--the first in the passionately vibrant tones of my\nsister-in-law, and the latter in the deeper and more restrained accents\nof an angry man--startled me from my nap. I had been dozing in my\nhammock on the front piazza, behind the honeysuckle vine. I had been\nfaintly aware of a buzz of conversation in the parlor, but had not\nat all awakened to its import until these sentences fell, or, I might\nrather say, were hurled upon my ear. I presume the young people had\neither not seen me lying there,--the Venetian blinds opening from the\nparlor windows upon the piazza were partly closed on account of the\nheat,--or else in their excitement they had forgotten my proximity.\n\nI felt somewhat concerned. The young man, I had remarked, was proud,\nfirm, jealous of the point of honor, and, from my observation of him,\nquite likely to resent to the bitter end what he deemed a slight or\nan injustice. The girl, I knew, was quite as high-spirited as young\nMurchison. I feared she was not so just, and hoped she would prove more\nyielding. I knew that her affections were strong and enduring, but that\nher temperament was capricious, and her sunniest moods easily overcast\nby some small cloud of jealousy or pique. I had never imagined, however,\nthat she was capable of such intensity as was revealed by these few\nwords of hers. As I say, I felt concerned. I had learned to like Malcolm\nMurchison, and had heartily consented to his marriage with my ward; for\nit was in that capacity that I had stood for a year or two to my wife's\nyounger sister, Mabel. The match thus rudely broken off had promised to\nbe another link binding me to the kindly Southern people among whom I\nhad not long before taken up my residence.\n\nYoung Murchison came out of the door, cleared the piazza in two strides\nwithout seeming aware of my presence, and went off down the lane at a\nfurious pace. A few moments later Mabel began playing the piano loudly,\nwith a touch that indicated anger and pride and independence and a dash\nof exultation, as though she were really glad that she had driven away\nforever the young man whom the day before she had loved with all the\nardor of a first passion.\n\nI hoped that time might heal the breach and bring the two young people\ntogether again. I told my wife what I had overheard. In return she gave\nme Mabel's version of the affair.\n\n\"I do not see how it can ever be settled,\" my wife said. \"It is\nsomething more than a mere lovers' quarrel. It began, it is true,\nbecause she found fault with him for going to church with that hateful\nBranson girl. But before it ended there were things said that no woman\nof any spirit could stand. I am afraid it is all over between them.\"\n\nI was sorry to hear this. In spite of the very firm attitude taken by\nmy wife and her sister, I still hoped that the quarrel would be made up\nwithin a day or two. Nevertheless, when a week had passed with no word\nfrom young Murchison, and with no sign of relenting on Mabel's part, I\nbegan to think myself mistaken.\n\nOne pleasant afternoon, about ten days after the rupture, old Julius\ndrove the rockaway up to the piazza, and my wife, Mabel, and I took\nour seats for a drive to a neighbor's vineyard, over on the Lumberton\nplankroad.\n\n\"Which way shall we go,\" I asked,--\"the short road or the long one?\"\n\n\"I guess we had better take the short road,\" answered my wife. \"We will\nget there sooner.\"\n\n\"It's a mighty fine dribe roun' by de big road, Mis' Annie,\" observed\nJulius, \"en it doan take much longer to git dere.\"\n\n\"No,\" said my wife, \"I think we will go by the short road. There is a\nbay tree in blossom near the mineral spring, and I wish to get some of\nthe flowers.\"\n\n\"I 'spec's you'd find some bay trees 'long de big road, ma'am,\" said\nJulius.\n\n\"But I know about the flowers on the short road, and they are the ones I\nwant.\"\n\nWe drove down the lane to the highway, and soon struck into the short\nroad leading past the mineral spring. Our route lay partly through a\nswamp, and on each side the dark, umbrageous foliage, unbroken by\nany clearing, lent to the road solemnity, and to the air a refreshing\ncoolness. About half a mile from the house, and about halfway to the\nmineral spring, we stopped at the tree of which my wife had spoken, and\nreaching up to the low-hanging boughs I gathered a dozen of the fragrant\nwhite flowers. When I resumed my seat in the rockaway, Julius started\nthe mare. She went on for a few rods, until we had reached the edge of a\nbranch crossing the road, when she stopped short.\n\n\"Why did you stop, Julius?\" I asked.\n\n\"I didn', suh,\" he replied. \"'T wuz de mare stop'. G' 'long dere, Lucy!\nW'at you mean by dis foolis'ness?\"\n\nJulius jerked the reins and applied the whip lightly, but the mare did\nnot stir.\n\n\"Perhaps you had better get down and lead her,\" I suggested. \"If you get\nher started, you can cross on the log and keep your feet dry.\"\n\nJulius alighted, took hold of the bridle, and vainly essayed to make the\nmare move. She planted her feet with even more evident obstinacy.\n\n\"I don't know what to make of this,\" I said. \"I have never known her to\nbalk before. Have you, Julius?\"\n\n\"No, suh,\" replied the old man, \"I nebber has. It's a cu'ous thing ter\nme, suh.\"\n\n\"What's the best way to make her go?\"\n\n\"I 'spec's, suh, dat ef I'd tu'n her roun' she'd go de udder way.\"\n\n\"But we want her to go this way.\"\n\n\"Well, suh, I 'low ef we des set heah fo' er fibe minutes, she'll sta't\nup by herse'f.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I rejoined, \"it is cooler here than any place I have struck\nto-day. We'll let her stand for a while, and see what she does.\"\n\nWe had sat in silence for a few minutes, when Julius suddenly\nejaculated, \"Uh huh! I knows w'y dis mare doan go. It des flash 'cross\nmy reccommemb'ance.\"\n\n\"Why is it, Julius?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Ca'se she sees Chloe.\"\n\n\"Where is Chloe?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Chloe's done be'n dead dese fo'ty years er mo',\" the old man returned.\n\"Her ha'nt is settin' ober yander on de udder side er de branch, unner\ndat willer tree, dis blessed minute.\"\n\n\"Why, Julius!\" said my wife, \"do you see the haunt?\"\n\n\"No'm,\" he answered, shaking his head, \"I doan see 'er, but de mare sees\n'er.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Well, suh, dis yer is a gray hoss, en dis yer is a Friday; en a gray\nhoss kin alluz see a ha'nt w'at walks on Friday.\"\n\n\"Who was Chloe?\" said Mabel.\n\n\"And why does Chloe's haunt walk?\" asked my wife.\n\n\"It's all in de tale, ma'am,\" Julius replied, with a deep sigh. \"It's\nall in de tale.\"\n\n\"Tell us the tale,\" I said. \"Perhaps, by the time you get through, the\nhaunt will go away and the mare will cross.\"\n\nI was willing to humor the old man's fancy. He had not told us a\nstory for some time; and the dark and solemn swamp around us; the\namber-colored stream flowing silently and sluggishly at our feet, like\nthe waters of Lethe; the heavy, aromatic scent of the bays, faintly\nsuggestive of funeral wreaths,--all made the place an ideal one for a\nghost story.\n\n\"Chloe,\" Julius began in a subdued tone, \"use' ter b'long ter ole Mars'\nDugal' McAdoo--my ole marster. She wuz a ladly gal en a smart gal, en\nole mis' tuk her up ter de big house, en l'arnt her ter wait on de w'ite\nfolks, 'tel bimeby she come ter be mis's own maid, en 'peared ter 'low\nshe run de house herse'f, ter heah her talk erbout it. I wuz a young\nboy den, en use' ter wuk about de stables, so I knowed ev'ythin' dat wuz\ngwine on roun' de plantation.\n\n\"Well, one time Mars' Dugal' wanted a house boy, en sont down ter de\nqua'ters fer hab Jeff en Hannibal come up ter de big house nex'\nmawnin'. Ole marster en ole mis' look' de two boys ober, en 'sco'sed wid\ndeyse'ves fer a little w'ile, en den Mars' Dugal' sez, sezee:--\n\n\"'We laks Hannibal de bes', en we gwine ter keep him. Heah, Hannibal,\nyou'll wuk at de house fum now on. En ef you're a good nigger en min's\nyo' bizness, I'll gib you Chloe fer a wife nex' spring. You other\nnigger, you Jeff, you kin go back ter de qua'ters. We ain' gwine ter\nneed you.'\n\n\"Now Chloe had be'n standin' dere behin' ole mis' dyoin' all er dis yer\ntalk, en Chloe made up her min' fum de ve'y fus' minute she sot eyes on\ndem two dat she didn' lak dat nigger Hannibal, en wa'n't nebber gwine\nkeer fer 'im, en she wuz des ez sho' dat she lak Jeff, en wuz gwine ter\nset sto' by 'im, whuther Mars' Dugal' tuk 'im in de big house er no; en\nso co'se Chloe wuz monst'us sorry w'en ole Mars' Dugal' tuk Hannibal en\nsont Jeff back. So she slip' roun' de house en waylaid Jeff on de way\nback ter de qua'ters en tol' 'im not ter be downhea'ted, fer she wuz\ngwine ter see ef she couldn' fin' some way er 'nuther ter git rid er dat\nnigger Hannibal, en git Jeff up ter de house in his place.\n\n\"De noo house boy kotch on monst'us fas', en it wa'n't no time ha'dly\nbefo' Mars' Dugal' en ole mis' bofe 'mence' ter 'low Hannibal wuz de\nbes' house boy dey eber had. He wuz peart en soopl', quick ez lightnin',\nen sha'p ez a razor. But Chloe didn' lak his ways. He wuz so sho' he wuz\ngwine ter git 'er in de spring, dat he didn' 'pear ter 'low he had ter\ndo any co'tin', en w'en he'd run 'cross Chloe 'bout de house, he'd swell\nroun' 'er in a biggity way en say:\n\n\"'Come heah en kiss me, honey. You gwine ter be mine in de spring. You\ndoan 'pear ter be ez fon' er me ez you oughter be.'\n\n\"Chloe didn' keer nuffin' fer Hannibal, en hadn' keered nuffin' fer 'im,\nen she sot des ez much sto' by Jeff ez she did de day she fus' laid eyes\non 'im. En de mo' fermilyus dis yer Hannibal got, de mo' Chloe let\nher min' run on Jeff, en one ebenin' she went down ter de qua'ters en\nwatch', 'tel she got a chance fer ter talk wid 'im by hisse'f. En she\ntol' Jeff fer ter go down en see ole Aun' Peggy, de cunjuh-'oman down\nby de Wim'l'ton Road, en ax her fer ter gib 'im sump'n ter he'p git\nHannibal out'n de big house, so de w'ite folks 'u'd sen' fer Jeff ag'in.\nEn bein' ez Jeff didn' hab nuffin' ter gib Aun' Peggy, Chloe gun i'm a\nsilber dollah en a silk han'kercher fer ter pay her wid, fer Aun' Peggy\nnebber lak ter wuk fer nobody fer nuffin'.\n\n\"So Jeff slip' off down ter Aun' Peggy's one night, en gun 'er de\npresents he brung, en tol' er all 'bout 'im en Chloe en Hannibal, en ax'\n'er ter he'p 'im out. Aun' Peggy tol' 'im she'd wuk 'er roots, en fer\n'im ter come back de nex' night, en she'd tell 'im w'at she c'd do fer\n'im.\n\n\"So de nex' night Jeff went back, en Aun' Peggy gun 'im a baby-doll, wid\na body made out'n a piece er co'n-stalk, en wid splinters fer a'ms en\nlegs, en a head made out'n elderberry peth, en two little red peppers\nfer feet.\n\n\"'Dis yer baby-doll,' sez she, 'is Hannibal. Dis yer peth head is\nHannibal's head, en dese yer pepper feet is Hannibal's feet. You take\ndis en hide it unner de house, on de sill unner de do', whar Hannibal'll\nhafter walk ober it ev'y day. En ez long ez Hannibal comes anywhar nigh\ndis baby-doll, he'll be des lak it is--light-headed en hot-footed; en\nef dem two things doan git 'im inter trouble mighty soon, den I'm no\ncunjuh-'oman. But w'en you git Hannibal out'n de house, en git all thoo\nwid dis baby-doll, you mus' fetch it back ter me, fer it's monst'us\npowerful goopher, en is liable ter make mo' trouble ef you leabe it\nlayin' roun'.'\n\n\"Well, Jeff tuk de baby-doll, en slip' up ter de big house, en whistle'\nter Chloe, en w'en she come out he tol' 'er w'at ole Aun' Peggy had\nsaid. En Chloe showed 'im how ter git unner de house, en w'en he had\nput de cunjuh-doll on de sill he went 'long back ter de qua'ters--en des\nwaited.\n\n\"Nex' day, sho' 'nuff, de goopher 'mence' ter wuk. Hannibal sta'ted in\nde house soon in de mawnin' wid a armful er wood ter make a fier, en he\nhadn' mo' d'n got 'cross de do'sill befo' his feet begun ter bu'n so\ndat he drap' de armful er wood on de flo' en woke ole mis' up an hour\nsooner'n yuzhal, en co'se ole mis' didn' lak dat, en spoke sha'p erbout\nit.\n\n\"W'en dinner-time come, en Hannibal wuz help'n de cook kyar de dinner\nf'm de kitchen inter de big house, en wuz gittin' close ter de do' what\nhe had ter go in, his feet sta'ted ter bu'n en his head begun ter swim,\nen he let de big dish er chicken en dumplin's fall right down in de\ndirt, in de middle er de ya'd, en de w'ite folks had ter make dey dinner\ndat day off'n col' ham en sweet pertaters.\n\n\"De nex' mawnin' he overslep' hisse'f, en got inter mo' trouble. Atter\nbreakfus', Mars' Dugal' sont 'im ober ter Mars' Marrabo Utley's fer ter\nborry a monkey wrench. He oughter be'n back in ha'f an hour, but he\ncome pokin' home 'bout dinner'time wid a screw-driver stidder a monkey\nwrench. Mars' Dugal' sont ernudder nigger back wid de screw-driver,\nen Hannibal didn' git no dinner. 'Long in de atternoon, ole mis' sot\nHannibal ter weedin' de flowers in de front gyahden, en Hannibal dug up\nall de bulbs ole mis' had sont erway fer, en paid a lot er money fer,\nen tuk 'em down ter de hawg-pen by de ba'nya'd, en fed 'em ter de hawgs.\nW'en ole mis' come out in de cool er de ebenin', en seed w'at Hannibal\nhad done, she wuz mos' crazy, en she wrote a note en sont Hannibal down\nter de obserseah wid it.\n\n\"But w'at Hannibal got fum de oberseah didn' 'pear ter do no good. Ev'y\nnow en den 'is feet'd 'mence ter torment 'im, en 'is min' 'u'd git all\nmix' up, en his conduc' kep' gittin' wusser en wusser, 'tel fin'ly de\nw'ite folks couldn' stan' it no longer, en Mars' Dugal' tuk Hannibal\nback down ter de qua'ters.\n\n\"'Mr. Smif,' sez Mars' Dugal' ter de oberseah, 'dis yer nigger has tu'nt\nout so triflin' yer lately, dat we can't keep 'im at de house no mo', en\nI's fotch' 'im ter you ter be straighten' up. You's had 'casion ter deal\nwid 'im once, so he knows w'at ter expec'. You des take 'im in han', en\nlemme know how he tu'ns out. En w'en de han's comes in fum de fiel' dis\nebenin' you kin sen' dat yaller nigger Jeff up ter de house. I'll try\n'im, en see ef he's any better'n Hannibal.'\n\n\"So Jeff went up ter de big house, en pleas' Mars' Dugal' en ole mis' en\nde res' er de fambly so well dat dey all got ter lakin' 'im fus'rate, en\ndey'd 'a' fergot all 'bout Hannibal ef it hadn' be'n fer de bad repo'ts\nw'at come up fum de qua'ters 'bout 'im fer a mont' er so. Fac' is dat\nChloe en Jeff wuz so int'rusted in one ernudder since Jeff be'n up ter\nde house, dat dey fergot all about takin' de baby-doll back ter Aun'\nPeggy, en it kep' wukkin fer a w'ile, en makin' Hannibal's feet bu'n mo'\ner less, 'tel all de folks on de plantation got ter callin' 'im Hot-Foot\nHannibal. He kep' gittin' mo' en mo' triflin', 'tel he got de name er\nbein' de mos' no 'countes' nigger on de plantation, en Mars' Dugal'\nhad ter th'eaten ter sell 'im in de spring; w'en bimeby de goopher quit\nwukkin', en Hannibal 'mence' ter pick up some en make folks set a little\nmo' sto' by 'im.\n\n\"Now, dis yer Hannibal was a monst'us sma't nigger, en w'en he got rid\ner dem so' feet his min' kep' runnin' on 'is udder troubles. Heah th'ee\ner fo' weeks befo' he'd had a' easy job, waitin' on de w'ite folks,\nlibbin off'n de fat er de lan', en promus' de fines' gal on de\nplantation fer a wife in de spring, en now heah he wuz back in de\nco'nfiel', wid de oberseah a-cussin' en a r'arin' ef he didn' get a ha'd\ntas' done; wid nuffin' but co'n bread en bacon en merlasses ter eat;\nen all de fiel-han's makin' rema'ks, en pokin' fun at 'im ca'se he be'n\nsont back fum de big house ter de fiel'. En de mo' Hannibal studied\n'bout it de mo' madder he got, 'tel he fin'ly swo' he wuz gwine ter git\neben wid Jeff en Chloe ef it wuz de las' ac'.\n\n\"So Hannibal slipped 'way fum de qua'ters one Sunday en hid in de co'n\nup close ter de big house, 'tel he see Chloe gwine down de road. He\nwaylaid her, en sezee:--\n\n\"'Hoddy, Chloe?'\n\n\"'I ain't got no time fer ter fool wid fiel'-han's,' sez Chloe, tossin'\nher head; 'W'at you want wid me, Hot-Foot?'\n\n\"'I wants ter know how you en Jeff is gittin' 'long.'\n\n\"'I 'lows dat's none er yo' bizness, nigger. I doan see w'at 'casion any\ncommon fiel'-han' has got ter mix in wid de 'fairs er folks w'at libs in\nde big house. But ef it'll do you any good ter know, I mought say dat me\nen Jeff is gittin' 'long mighty well, en we gwine ter git married in de\nspring, en you ain' gwine ter be 'vited ter de weddin' nuther.'\n\n\"'No, no!' sezee, 'I wouldn' 'spec' ter be 'vited ter de weddin',--a\ncommon, low-down fiel'-han' lak I is. But I's glad ter heah you en Jeff\nis gittin' 'long so well. I didn' knowed but w'at he had 'mence' ter be\na little ti'ed.'\n\n\"'Ti'ed er me? Dat's rediklus!' sez Chloe. 'W'y, dat nigger lubs me so\nI b'liebe he'd go th'oo fier en water fer me. Dat nigger is des wrop' up\nin me.'\n\n\"'Uh huh,' sez Hannibal, 'den I reckon is mus' be some udder nigger w'at\nmeets a 'oman down by de crick in de swamp ev'y Sunday ebenin', ter say\nnuffin' 'bout two er th'ee times a week.'\n\n\"'Yas, hit is ernudder nigger, en you is a liah w'en you say it wuz\nJeff.'\n\n\"'Mebbe I is a liah, en mebbe I ain' got good eyes. But 'less'n I IS a\nliah, en 'less'n I AIN' got good eyes, Jeff is gwine ter meet dat 'oman\ndis ebenin' long 'bout eight o'clock right down dere by de crick in de\nswamp 'bout halfway betwix' dis plantation en Mars' Marrabo Utley's.'\n\n\"Well, Chloe tol' Hannibal she didn' b'liebe a wud he said, en call'\n'im a low-down nigger who wuz tryin' ter slander Jeff 'ca'se he wuz mo'\nluckier'n he wuz. But all de same, she couldn' keep her min' fum runnin'\non w'at Hannibal had said. She 'membered she'd heared one er de niggers\nsay dey wuz a gal ober at Mars' Marrabo Utley's plantation w'at Jeff\nuse' ter go wid some befo' he got 'quainted wid Chloe. Den she 'mence'\nter figger back, en sho' 'nuff, dey wuz two er th'ee times in de las'\nweek w'en she'd be'n he'p'n de ladies wid dey dressin' en udder fixin's\nin de ebenin', en Jeff mought 'a' gone down ter de swamp widout her\nknowin' 'bout it at all. En den she 'mence' ter 'member little things\nw'at she hadn' tuk no notice of befo', en w'at 'u'd make it 'pear lak\nJeff had sump'n on his min'.\n\n\"Chloe set a monst'us heap er sto' by Jeff, en would 'a' done mos'\nanythin' fer 'im, so long ez he stuck ter her. But Chloe wuz a mighty\njealous 'oman, en w'iles she didn' b'liebe w'at Hannibal said, she seed\nhow it COULD 'a' be'n so, en she 'termine' fer ter fin' out fer herse'f\nwhuther it WUZ so er no.\n\n\"Now, Chloe hadn' seed Jeff all day, fer Mars' Dugal' had sont Jeff ober\nter his daughter's house, young Mis' Ma'g'ret's, w'at libbed 'bout fo'\nmiles fum Mars' Dugal's, en Jeff wuzn' 'spected home 'tel ebenin'. But\ndes atter supper wuz ober, en w'iles de ladies wuz settin' out on de\npiazzer, Chloe slip' off fum de house en run down de road,--dis yer\nsame road we come; en w'en she got mos' ter de crick--dis yer same crick\nright befo' us--she kin' er kip' in de bushes at de side er de road,\n'tel fin'ly she seed Jeff settin' on de back on de udder side er de\ncrick,--right under dat ole willer tree droopin' ober de watah yander.\nEn ev'y now en den he'd git up en look up de road to'ds Mars' Marrabo's\non de udder side er de swamp.\n\n\"Fus' Chloe felt lak she'd go right ober de crick en gib Jeff a piece er\nher min'. Den she 'lowed she better be sho' befo' she done anythin'. So\nshe helt herse'f in de bes' she could, gittin' madder en madder ev'ry\nminute, 'tel bimeby she seed a 'oman comin' down de road on de udder\nside fum to'ds Mars' Marrabo Utley's plantation. En w'en she seed Jeff\njump up en run to'ds dat 'oman, en th'ow his a'ms roun' her neck, po'\nChloe didn' stop ter see no mo', but des tu'nt roun' en run up ter de\nhouse, en rush' up on de piazzer, en up en tol' Mars' Dugal' en ole mis'\nall 'bout de baby-doll, en all 'bout Jeff gittin' de goopher fum Aun'\nPeggy, en 'bout w'at de goopher had done ter Hannibal.\n\n\"Mars' Dugal' wuz monst'us mad. He didn' let on at fus' lak he b'liebed\nChloe, but w'en she tuk en showed 'im whar ter fin' de baby-doll, Mars'\nDugal' tu'nt w'ite ez chalk.\n\n\"'What debil's wuk is dis?' sezee. 'No wonder de po' nigger's feet\neetched. Sump'n got ter be done ter l'arn dat ole witch ter keep her\nhan's off'n my niggers. En ez fer dis yer Jeff, I'm gwine ter do des\nw'at I promus', so de darkies on dis plantation'll know I means w'at I\nsez.'\n\n\"Fer Mars' Dugal' had warned de han's befo' 'bout foolin' wid\ncunju'ation; fac', he had los' one er two niggers hisse'f fum dey bein'\ngoophered, en he would 'a' had ole Aun' Peggy whip' long ago, on'y Aun'\nPeggy wuz a free 'oman, en he wuz 'feard she'd cunjuh him. En wi'les\nMars' Dugal' say he didn' b'liebe in cunj'in' en sich, he 'peared ter\n'low it wuz bes' ter be on de safe side, en let Aun' Peggy alone.\n\n\"So Mars' Dugal' done des ez he say. Ef ole mis' had ple'd fer Jeff he\nmought 'a' kep' 'im. But ole mis' hadn' got ober losin' dem bulbs yit,\nen she nebber said a wud. Mars' Dugal' tuk Jeff ter town nex' day en'\nsol' 'im ter a spekilater, who sta'ted down de ribber wid 'im nex'\nmawnin' on a steamboat, fer ter take 'im ter Alabama.\n\n\"Now, w'en Chloe tol' ole Mars' Dugal' 'bout dis yer baby-doll en dis\nudder goopher, she hadn' ha'dly 'lowed Mars' Dugal' would sell Jeff down\nSouf. Howsomeber, she wuz so mad wid Jeff dat she 'suaded herse'f she\ndidn' keer; en so she hilt her head up en went roun' lookin' lak she wuz\nrale glad 'bout it. But one day she wuz walkin' down de road, w'en who\nsh'd come 'long but dis yer Hannibal.\n\n\"W'en Hannibal seed 'er he bus' out laffin' fittin' fer ter kill: 'Yah,\nyah, yah! ho, ho, ho! ha, ha, ha! Oh, hol' me, honey, hol' me, er I'll\nlaf myse'f ter def. I ain' nebber laf' so much sence I be'n bawn.'\n\n\"'W'at you laffin' at, Hot-Foot?'\n\n\"'Yah, yah, yah! W'at I laffin' at? W'y, I's laffin' at myse'f, tooby\nsho',--laffin' ter think w'at a fine 'oman I made.'\n\n\"Chloe tu'nt pale, en her hea't come up in her mouf.\n\n\"'W'at you mean, nigger?' sez she, ketchin' holt er a bush by de road\nfer ter stiddy herse'f. 'W'at you mean by de kin' er 'oman you made?'\n\n\"W'at do I mean? I means dat I got squared up wid you fer treatin' me\nde way you done, en I got eben wid dat yaller nigger Jeff fer cuttin' me\nout. Now, he's gwine ter know w'at it is ter eat co'n bread en merlasses\nonce mo', en wuk fum daylight ter da'k, en ter hab a oberseah dribin'\n'im fum one day's een' ter de udder. I means dat I sont wud ter Jeff dat\nSunday dat you wuz gwine ter be ober ter Mars' Marrabo's visitin' dat\nebenin', en you want i'm ter meet you down by de crick on de way home en\ngo de rest er de road wid you. En den I put on a frock en a sun-bonnet\nen fix' myse'f up ter look lak a 'oman; en w'en Jeff seed me comin' he\nrun ter meet me, en you seed 'im,--fer I had be'n watchin' in de bushes\nbefo' en 'skivered you comin' down de road. En now I reckon you en Jeff\nbofe knows w'at it means ter mess wid a nigger lak me.'\n\n\"Po' Chloe hadn' heared mo' d'n half er de las' part er w'at Hannibal\nsaid, but she had heared 'nuff to l'arn dat dis nigger had fooler her en\nJeff, en dat po' Jeff hadn' done nuffin', en dat fer lovin' her too much\nen goin' ter meet her she had cause' 'im ter be sol' erway whar she'd\nnebber, nebber see 'im no mo'. De sun mought shine by day, de moon by\nnight, de flowers mought bloom, en de mawkin'-birds mought sing, but po'\nJeff wuz done los' ter her fereber en fereber.\n\n\"Hannibal hadn' mo' d'n finish' w'at he had ter say, w'en Chloe's knees\ngun 'way unner her, en she fell down in de road, en lay dere half a'\nhour er so befo' she come to. W'en she did, she crep' up ter de house\ndes ez pale ez a ghos'. En fer a mont' er so she crawled roun' de house,\nen 'peared ter be so po'ly dat Mars' Dugal' sont fer a doctor; en de\ndoctor kep' on axin' her questions 'tel he foun' she wuz des pinin'\nerway fer Jeff.\n\n\"W'en he tol' Mars' Dugal', Mars' Dugal' lafft, en said he'd fix dat.\nShe could hab de noo house boy fer a husban'. But ole mis' say, no,\nChloe ain' dat kinder gal, en dat Mars' Dugal' should buy Jeff back.\n\n\"So Mars' Dugal' writ a letter ter dis yer spekilater down ter\nWim'l'ton, en tol' ef he ain' done sol' dat nigger Souf w'at he bought\nfum 'im, he'd lak ter buy 'm back ag'in. Chloe 'mence' ter pick up a\nlittle w'en ole mis' tol' her 'bout dis letter. Howsomeber, bimeby Mars'\nDugal' got a' answer fum de spekilater, who said he wuz monst'us sorry,\nbut Jeff had fell ove'boa'd er jumped off'n de steamboat on de way ter\nWim'l'ton, en got drownded, en co'se he couldn' sell 'im back, much ez\nhe'd lak ter 'bleedge Mars' Dugal'.\n\n\"Well, atter Chloe heared dis she pu'tended ter do her wuk, en ole mis'\nwa'n't much mo' use ter nobody. She put up wid her, en hed de doctor gib\nher medicine, en let 'er go ter de circus, en all so'ts er things fer\nter take her min' off'n her troubles. But dey didn' none un 'em do no\ngood. Chloe got ter slippin' down here in de ebenin' des lak she 'uz\ncomin' ter meet Jeff, en she'd set dere unner dat willer tree on de\nudder side, en wait fer 'im, night atter night. Bimeby she got so bad\nde w'ite folks sont her ober ter young Mis' Ma'g'ret's fer ter gib her\na change; but she runned erway de fus' night, en w'en dey looked fer\n'er nex' mawnin' dey foun' her co'pse layin' in de branch yander, right\n'cross fum whar we're settin' now.\n\n\"Eber sence den,\" said Julius in conclusion, \"Chloe's ha'nt comes eve'y\nebenin' en sets down unner dat willer tree en waits fer Jeff, er e'se\nwalks up en down de road yander, lookin' en lookin', en' [sic] waitin'\nen waitin', fer her sweethea't w'at ain' nebber, nebber come back ter\nher no mo'.\"\n\nThere was silence when the old man had finished, and I am sure I saw a\ntear in my wife's eye, and more than one in Mabel's.\n\n\"I think, Julius,\" said my wife after a moment, \"that you may turn the\nmare around and go by the long road.\"\n\nThe old man obeyed with alacrity, and I noticed no reluctance on the\nmare's part.\n\n\"You are not afraid of Chloe's haunt, are you?\" I asked jocularly.\n\nMy mood was not responded to, and neither of the ladies smiled.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Annie, \"but I've changed my mind. I prefer the other\nroute.\"\n\nWhen we had reached the main road and had proceeded along it for a short\ndistance, we met a cart driven by a young negro, and on the cart were\na trunk and a valise. We recognized the man as Malcolm Murchison's\nservant, and drew up a moment to speak to him.\n\n\"Who's going away, Marshall?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Young Mistah Ma'colm gwine 'way on de boat ter Noo Yo'k dis ebenin',\nsuh, en I'm takin' his things down ter de wharf, suh.\"\n\nThis was news to me, and I heard it with regret. My wife looked sorry,\ntoo, and I could see that Mabel was trying hard to hide her concern.\n\n\"He's comin' 'long behin', suh, en I 'spec's you'll meet 'im up de road\na piece. He's gwine ter walk down ez fur ez Mistah Jim Williams's, en\ntake de buggy fum dere ter town. He 'spec's ter be gone a long time,\nsuh, en say prob'ly he ain' nebber comin' back.\"\n\nThe man drove on. There were a few words exchanged in an undertone\nbetween my wife and Mabel, which I did not catch. Then Annie\nsaid: \"Julius, you may stop the rockaway a moment. There are some\ntrumpet-flowers by the road there that I want. Will you get them for me,\nJohn?\"\n\nI sprang into the underbrush, and soon returned with a great bunch of\nscarlet blossoms.\n\n\"Where is Mabel?\" I asked, noting her absence.\n\n\"She has walked on ahead. We shall overtake her in a few minutes.\"\n\nThe carriage had gone only a short distance when my wife discovered that\nshe had dropped her fan.\n\n\"I had it where we were stopping. Julius, will you go back and get it\nfor me?\"\n\nJulius got down and went back for the fan. He was an unconscionably long\ntime finding it. After we got started again we had gone only a little\nway, when we saw Mabel and young Murchison coming toward us. They were\nwalking arm in arm, and their faces were aglow with the light of love.\n\n\nI do not know whether or not Julius had a previous understanding with\nMalcolm Murchison by which he was to drive us round by the long road\nthat day, nor do I know exactly what motive influenced the old man's\nexertions in the matter. He was fond of Mabel, but I was old enough, and\nknew Julius well enough, to be skeptical of his motives. It is certain\nthat a most excellent understanding existed between him and Murchison\nafter the reconciliation, and that when the young people set up\nhousekeeping over at the old Murchison place Julius had an opportunity\nto enter their service. For some reason or other, however, he preferred\nto remain with us. The mare, I might add, was never known to balk again.\n\n\n\n\nA NEGRO SCHOOLMASTER IN THE NEW SOUTH by W. E. Burghardt Du Bois\n\n\nOnce upon a time I taught school in the hills of Tennessee, where the\nbroad dark vale of the Mississippi begins to roll and crumple to greet\nthe Alleghanies. I was a Fisk student then, and all Fisk men think that\nTennessee--beyond the Veil--is theirs alone, and in vacation time they\nsally forth in lusty bands to meet the county school commissioners.\nYoung and happy, I too went, and I shall not soon forget that summer,\nten years ago.\n\nFirst, there was a teachers' Institute at the county-seat; and there\ndistinguished guests of the superintendent taught the teachers fractions\nand spelling and other mysteries,--white teachers in the morning,\nNegroes at night. A picnic now and then, and a supper, and the rough\nworld was softened by laughter and song. I remember how--But I wander.\n\nThere came a day when all the teachers left the Institute, and began\nthe hunt for schools. I learn from hearsay (for my mother was mortally\nafraid of firearms) that the hunting of ducks and bears and men is\nwonderfully interesting, but I am sure that the man who has never hunted\na country school has something to learn of the pleasures of the chase.\nI see now the white, hot roads lazily rise and fall and wind before me\nunder the burning July sun; I feel the deep weariness of heart and limb,\nas ten, eight, six miles stretch relentlessly ahead; I feel my heart\nsink heavily as I hear again and again, \"Got a teacher? Yes.\" So I\nwalked on and on,--horses were too expensive,--until I had wandered\nbeyond railways, beyond stage lines, to a land of \"varmints\" and\nrattlesnakes, where the coming of a stranger was an event, and men lived\nand died in the shadow of one blue hill.\n\nSprinkled over hill and dale lay cabins and farmhouses, shut out from\nthe world by the forests and the rolling hills toward the east. There\nI found at last a little school. Josie told me of it; she was a thin,\nhomely girl of twenty, with a dark brown face and thick, hard hair. I\nhad crossed the stream at Watertown, and rested under the great willows;\nthen I had gone to the little cabin in the lot where Josie was resting\non her way to town. The gaunt farmer made me welcome, and Josie, hearing\nmy errand, told me anxiously that they wanted a school over the hill;\nthat but once since the war had a teacher been there; that she herself\nlonged to learn,--and thus she ran on, talking fast and loud, with much\nearnestness and energy.\n\nNext morning I crossed the tall round hill, lingered to look at the blue\nand yellow mountains stretching toward the Carolinas; then I plunged\ninto the wood, and came out at Josie's home. It was a dull frame cottage\nwith four rooms, perched just below the brow of the hill, amid peach\ntrees. The father was a quiet, simple soul, calmly ignorant, with no\ntouch of vulgarity. The mother was different,--strong, bustling, and\nenergetic, with a quick, restless tongue, and an ambition to live \"like\nfolks.\" There was a crowd of children. Two boys had gone away. There\nremained two growing girls; a shy midget of eight; John, tall, awkward,\nand eighteen; Jim, younger, quicker, and better looking; and two babies\nof indefinite age. Then there was Josie herself. She seemed to be\nthe centre of the family: always busy at service or at home, or\nberry-picking; a little nervous and inclined to scold, like her\nmother, yet faithful, too, like her father. She had about her a\ncertain fineness, the shadow of an unconscious moral heroism that would\nwillingly give all of life to make life broader, deeper, and fuller for\nher and hers. I saw much of this family afterward, and grew to love them\nfor their honest efforts to be decent and comfortable, and for their\nknowledge of their own ignorance. There was with them no affectation.\nThe mother would scold the father for being so \"easy;\" Josie would\nroundly rate the boys for carelessness; and all knew that it was a hard\nthing to dig a living out of a rocky side hill.\n\nI secured the school. I remember the day I rode horseback out to the\ncommissioner's house, with a pleasant young white fellow, who wanted the\nwhite school. The road ran down the bed of a stream; the sun laughed\nand the water jingled, and we rode on. \"Come in,\" said the\ncommissioner,--\"come in. Have a seat. Yes, that certificate will do.\nStay to dinner. What do you want a month?\" Oh, thought I, this is lucky;\nbut even then fell the awful shadow of the Veil, for they ate first,\nthen I--alone.\n\nThe schoolhouse was a log hut, where Colonel Wheeler used to shelter\nhis corn. It sat in a lot behind a rail fence and thorn bushes, near the\nsweetest of springs. There was an entrance where a door once was, and\nwithin, a massive rickety fireplace; great chinks between the logs\nserved as windows. Furniture was scarce. A pale blackboard crouched in\nthe corner. My desk was made of three boards, reinforced at critical\npoints, and my chair, borrowed from the landlady, had to be returned\nevery night. Seats for the children,--these puzzled me much. I was\nhaunted by a New England vision of neat little desks and chairs, but,\nalas, the reality was rough plank benches without backs, and at\ntimes without legs. They had the one virtue of making naps\ndangerous,--possibly fatal, for the floor was not to be trusted.\n\nIt was a hot morning late in July when the school opened. I trembled\nwhen I heard the patter of little feet down the dusty road, and saw the\ngrowing row of dark solemn faces and bright eager eyes facing me. First\ncame Josie and her brothers and sisters. The longing to know, to be a\nstudent in the great school at Nashville, hovered like a star above this\nchild woman amid her work and worry, and she studied doggedly. There\nwere the Dowells from their farm over toward Alexandria: Fanny, with her\nsmooth black face and wondering eyes; Martha, brown and dull; the pretty\ngirl wife of a brother, and the younger brood. There were the Burkes,\ntwo brown and yellow lads, and a tiny haughty-eyed girl. Fat Reuben's\nlittle chubby girl came, with golden face and old gold hair, faithful\nand solemn. 'Thenie was on hand early,--a jolly, ugly, good-hearted\ngirl, who slyly dipped snuff and looked after her little bow-legged\nbrother. When her mother could spare her, 'Tildy came,--a midnight\nbeauty, with starry eyes and tapering limbs; and her brother,\ncorrespondingly homely. And then the big boys: the hulking Lawrences;\nthe lazy Neills, unfathered sons of mother and daughter; Hickman, with a\nstoop in his shoulders; and the rest.\n\nThere they sat, nearly thirty of them, on the rough benches, their faces\nshading from a pale cream to a deep brown, the little feet bare and\nswinging, the eyes full of expectation, with here and there a twinkle\nof mischief, and the hands grasping Webster's blue-back spelling-book.\nI loved my school, and the fine faith the children had in the wisdom of\ntheir teacher was truly marvelous. We read and spelled together, wrote\na little, picked flowers, sang, and listened to stories of the world\nbeyond the hill. At times the school would dwindle away, and I would\nstart out. I would visit Mun Eddings, who lived in two very dirty rooms,\nand ask why little Lugene, whose flaming face seemed ever ablaze with\nthe dark red hair uncombed, was absent all last week, or why I missed\nso often the inimitable rags of Mack and Ed. Then the father, who worked\nColonel Wheeler's farm on shares, would tell me how the crops needed the\nboys; and the thin, slovenly mother, whose face was pretty when washed,\nassured me that Lugene must mind the baby. \"But we'll start them again\nnext week.\" When the Lawrences stopped, I knew that the doubts of the\nold folks about book-learning had conquered again, and so, toiling up\nthe hill, and getting as far into the cabin as possible, I put Cicero\npro Archia Poeta into the simplest English with local applications, and\nusually convinced them--for a week or so.\n\nOn Friday nights I often went home with some of the children; sometimes\nto Doc Burke's farm. He was a great, loud, thin Black, ever working, and\ntrying to buy the seventy-five acres of hill and dale where he lived;\nbut people said that he would surely fail, and the \"white folks would\nget it all.\" His wife was a magnificent Amazon, with saffron face and\nshining hair, uncorseted and barefooted, and the children were strong\nand beautiful. They lived in a one-and-a-half-room cabin in the hollow\nof the farm, near the spring. The front room was full of great fat white\nbeds, scrupulously neat; and there were bad chromos on the walls, and\na tired centre-table. In the tiny back kitchen I was often invited to\n\"take out and help\" myself to fried chicken and wheat biscuit, \"meat\"\nand corn pone, string beans and berries. At first I used to be a\nlittle alarmed at the approach of bed-time in the one lone bedroom, but\nembarrassment was very deftly avoided. First, all the children nodded\nand slept, and were stowed away in one great pile of goose feathers;\nnext, the mother and the father discreetly slipped away to the kitchen\nwhile I went to bed; then, blowing out the dim light, they retired\nin the dark. In the morning all were up and away before I thought of\nawaking. Across the road, where fat Reuben lived, they all went outdoors\nwhile the teacher retired, because they did not boast the luxury of a\nkitchen.\n\nI liked to stay with the Dowells, for they had four rooms and plenty\nof good country fare. Uncle Bird had a small, rough farm, all woods and\nhills, miles from the big road; but he was full of tales,--he preached\nnow and then,--and with his children, berries, horses, and wheat he was\nhappy and prosperous. Often, to keep the peace, I must go where life\nwas less lovely; for instance, 'Tildy's mother was incorrigibly dirty,\nReuben's larder was limited seriously, and herds of untamed bedbugs\nwandered over the Eddingses' beds. Best of all I loved to go to Josie's,\nand sit on the porch, eating peaches, while the mother bustled and\ntalked: how Josie had bought the sewing-machine; how Josie worked at\nservice in winter, but that four dollars a month was \"mighty little\"\nwages; how Josie longed to go away to school, but that it \"looked like\"\nthey never could get far enough ahead to let her; how the crops failed\nand the well was yet unfinished; and, finally, how \"mean\" some of the\nwhite folks were.\n\nFor two summers I lived in this little world; it was dull and humdrum.\nThe girls looked at the hill in wistful longing, and the boys fretted,\nand haunted Alexandria. Alexandria was \"town,\"--a straggling, lazy\nvillage of houses, churches, and shops, and an aristocracy of Toms,\nDicks, and Captains. Cuddled on the hill to the north was the village of\nthe colored folks, who lived in three or four room unpainted cottages,\nsome neat and homelike, and some dirty. The dwellings were scattered\nrather aimlessly, but they centred about the twin temples of the hamlet,\nthe Methodist and the Hard-Shell Baptist churches. These, in turn,\nleaned gingerly on a sad-colored schoolhouse. Hither my little world\nwended its crooked way on Sunday to meet other worlds, and gossip, and\nwonder, and make the weekly sacrifice with frenzied priest at the altar\nof the \"old-time religion.\" Then the soft melody and mighty cadences of\nNegro song fluttered and thundered.\n\nI have called my tiny community a world, and so its isolation made it;\nand yet there was among us but a half-awakened common consciousness,\nsprung from common joy and grief, at burial, birth, or wedding; from a\ncommon hardship in poverty, poor land, and low wages; and, above all,\nfrom the sight of the Veil that hung between us and Opportunity. All\nthis caused us to think some thoughts together; but these, when ripe for\nspeech, were spoken in various languages. Those whose eyes thirty and\nmore years before had seen \"the glory of the coming of the Lord\" saw\nin every present hindrance or help a dark fatalism bound to bring all\nthings right in His own good time. The mass of those to whom slavery\nwas a dim recollection of childhood found the world a puzzling thing:\nit asked little of them, and they answered with little, and yet it\nridiculed their offering. Such a paradox they could not understand, and\ntherefore sank into listless indifference, or shiftlessness, or reckless\nbravado. There were, however, some such as Josie, Jim, and Ben,--they\nto whom War, Hell, and Slavery were but childhood tales, whose\nyoung appetites had been whetted to an edge by school and story and\nhalf-awakened thought. Ill could they be content, born without\nand beyond the World. And their weak wings beat against their\nbarriers,--barriers of caste, of youth, of life; at last, in dangerous\nmoments, against everything that opposed even a whim.\n\n\nThe ten years that follow youth, the years when first the realization\ncomes that life is leading somewhere,--these were the years that passed\nafter I left my little school. When they were past, I came by chance\nonce more to the walls of Fisk University, to the halls of the chapel\nof melody. As I lingered there in the joy and pain of meeting old school\nfriends, there swept over me a sudden longing to pass again beyond the\nblue hill, and to see the homes and the school of other days, and to\nlearn how life had gone with my school-children; and I went.\n\nJosie was dead, and the gray-haired mother said simply, \"We've had a\nheap of trouble since you've been away.\" I had feared for Jim. With a\ncultured parentage and a social caste to uphold him, he might have made\na venturesome merchant or a West Point cadet. But here he was, angry\nwith life and reckless; and when Farmer Durham charged him with stealing\nwheat, the old man had to ride fast to escape the stones which the\nfurious fool hurled after him. They told Jim to run away; but he would\nnot run, and the constable came that afternoon. It grieved Josie, and\ngreat awkward John walked nine miles every day to see his little brother\nthrough the bars of Lebanon jail. At last the two came back together in\nthe dark night. The mother cooked supper, and Josie emptied her purse,\nand the boys stole away. Josie grew thin and silent, yet worked the\nmore. The hill became steep for the quiet old father, and with the boys\naway there was little to do in the valley. Josie helped them sell the\nold farm, and they moved nearer town. Brother Dennis, the carpenter,\nbuilt a new house with six rooms; Josie toiled a year in Nashville,\nand brought back ninety dollars to furnish the house and change it to a\nhome.\n\nWhen the spring came, and the birds twittered, and the stream ran proud\nand full, little sister Lizzie, bold and thoughtless, flushed with the\npassion of youth, bestowed herself on the tempter, and brought home\na nameless child. Josie shivered, and worked on, with the vision of\nschooldays all fled, with a face wan and tired,--worked until, on a\nsummer's day, some one married another; then Josie crept to her mother\nlike a hurt child, and slept--and sleeps.\n\nI paused to scent the breeze as I entered the valley. The Lawrences have\ngone; father and son forever, and the other son lazily digs in the earth\nto live. A new young widow rents out their cabin to fat Reuben. Reuben\nis a Baptist preacher now, but I fear as lazy as ever, though his cabin\nhas three rooms; and little Ella has grown into a bouncing woman, and is\nploughing corn on the hot hillside. There are babies a plenty, and one\nhalf-witted girl. Across the valley is a house I did not know before,\nand there I found, rocking one baby and expecting another, one of\nmy schoolgirls, a daughter of Uncle Bird Dowell. She looked somewhat\nworried with her new duties, but soon bristled into pride over her neat\ncabin, and the tale of her thrifty husband, the horse and cow, and the\nfarm they were planning to buy.\n\nMy log schoolhouse was gone. In its place stood Progress, and Progress,\nI understand, is necessarily ugly. The crazy foundation stones still\nmarked the former site of my poor little cabin, and not far away, on six\nweary boulders, perched a jaunty board house, perhaps twenty by thirty\nfeet, with three windows and a door that locked. Some of the window\nglass was broken, and part of an old iron stove lay mournfully under\nthe house. I peeped through the window half reverently, and found things\nthat were more familiar. The blackboard had grown by about two feet, and\nthe seats were still without backs. The county owns the lot now, I hear,\nand every year there is a session of school. As I sat by the spring and\nlooked on the Old and the New I felt glad, very glad, and yet--\n\n\nAfter two long drinks I started on. There was the great double log house\non the corner. I remembered the broken, blighted family that used to\nlive there. The strong, hard face of the mother, with its wilderness\nof hair, rose before me. She had driven her husband away, and while\nI taught school a strange man lived there, big and jovial, and people\ntalked. I felt sure that Ben and 'Tildy would come to naught from such\na home. But this is an odd world; for Ben is a busy farmer in Smith\nCounty, \"doing well, too,\" they say, and he had cared for little 'Tildy\nuntil last spring, when a lover married her. A hard life the lad had\nled, toiling for meat, and laughed at because he was homely and crooked.\nThere was Sam Carlon, an impudent old skinflint, who had definite\nnotions about niggers, and hired Ben a summer and would not pay him.\nThen the hungry boy gathered his sacks together, and in broad daylight\nwent into Carlon's corn; and when the hard-fisted farmer set upon him,\nthe angry boy flew at him like a beast. Doc Burke saved a murder and a\nlynching that day.\n\nThe story reminded me again of the Burkes, and an impatience seized me\nto know who won in the battle, Doc or the seventy-five acres. For it is\na hard thing to make a farm out of nothing, even in fifteen years. So\nI hurried on, thinking of the Burkes. They used to have a certain\nmagnificent barbarism about them that I liked. They were never vulgar,\nnever immoral, but rather rough and primitive, with an unconventionality\nthat spent itself in loud guffaws, slaps on the back, and naps in the\ncorner. I hurried by the cottage of the misborn Neill boys. It was\nempty, and they were grown into fat, lazy farm hands. I saw the home of\nthe Hickmans, but Albert, with his stooping shoulders, had passed from\nthe world. Then I came to the Burkes' gate and peered through; the\ninclosure looked rough and untrimmed, and yet there were the same fences\naround the old farm save to the left, where lay twenty-five other acres.\nAnd lo! the cabin in the hollow had climbed the hill and swollen to a\nhalf-finished six-room cottage.\n\nThe Burkes held a hundred acres, but they were still in debt. Indeed,\nthe gaunt father who toiled night and day would scarcely be happy out of\ndebt, being so used to it. Some day he must stop, for his massive frame\nis showing decline. The mother wore shoes, but the lionlike physique of\nother days was broken. The children had grown up. Rob, the image of his\nfather, was loud and rough with laughter. Birdie, my school baby of\nsix, had grown to a picture of maiden beauty, tall and tawny. \"Edgar\nis gone,\" said the mother, with head half bowed,--\"gone to work in\nNashville; he and his father couldn't agree.\"\n\nLittle Doc, the boy born since the time of my school, took me horseback\ndown the creek next morning toward Farmer Dowell's. The road and the\nstream were battling for mastery, and the stream had the better of it.\nWe splashed and waded, and the merry boy, perched behind me, chattered\nand laughed. He showed me where Simon Thompson had bought a bit of\nground and a home; but his daughter Lana, a plump, brown, slow girl, was\nnot there. She had married a man and a farm twenty miles away. We wound\non down the stream till we came to a gate that I did not recognize, but\nthe boy insisted that it was \"Uncle Bird's.\" The farm was fat with the\ngrowing crop. In that little valley was a strange stillness as I rode\nup; for death and marriage had stolen youth, and left age and childhood\nthere. We sat and talked that night, after the chores were done. Uncle\nBird was grayer, and his eyes did not see so well, but he was still\njovial. We talked of the acres bought,--one hundred and twenty-five,--of\nthe new guest chamber added, of Martha's marrying. Then we talked of\ndeath: Fanny and Fred were gone; a shadow hung over the other daughter,\nand when it lifted she was to go to Nashville to school. At last we\nspoke of the neighbors, and as night fell Uncle Bird told me how, on a\nnight like that, 'Thenie came wandering back to her home over yonder, to\nescape the blows of her husband. And next morning she died in the home\nthat her little bow-legged brother, working and saving, had bought for\ntheir widowed mother.\n\nMy journey was done, and behind me lay hill and dale, and Life and\nDeath. How shall man measure Progress there where the dark-faced Josie\nlies? How many heartfuls of sorrow shall balance a bushel of wheat? How\nhard a thing is life to the lowly, and yet how human and real! And\nall this life and love and strife and failure,--is it the twilight of\nnightfall or the flush of some faint-dawning day?\n\nThus sadly musing, I rode to Nashville in the Jim Crow car.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF A SLAVER by J. Taylor Wood\n\n\nFrom 1830 to 1850 both Great Britain and the United States, by joint\nconvention, kept on the coast of Africa at least eighty guns afloat for\nthe suppression of the slave trade. Most of the vessels so employed were\nsmall corvettes, brigs, or schooners; steam at that time was just being\nintroduced into the navies of the world.\n\nNearly fifty years ago I was midshipman on the United States brig\nPorpoise, of ten guns. Some of my readers may remember these little\nten-gun coffins, as many of them proved to be to their crews. The\nPorpoise was a fair sample of the type; a full-rigged brig of one\nhundred and thirty tons, heavily sparred, deep waisted, and carrying a\nbattery of eight twenty-four-pound carronades and two long chasers; so\nwet that even in a moderate breeze or sea it was necessary to batten\ndown; and so tender that she required careful watching; only five feet\nbetween decks, her quarters were necessarily cramped and uncomfortable,\nand, as far as possible, we lived on deck. With a crew of eighty all\ntold, Lieutenant Thompson was in command, Lieutenant Bukett executive\nofficer, and two midshipmen were the line officers. She was so slow that\nwe could hardly hope for a prize except by a fluke. Repeatedly we had\nchased suspicious craft only to be out-sailed.\n\nAt this time the traffic in slaves was very brisk; the demand in the\nBrazils, in Cuba, and in other Spanish West Indies was urgent, and the\nprofit of the business so great that two or three successful ventures\nwould enrich any one. The slavers were generally small, handy craft;\nfast, of course; usually schooner-rigged, and carrying flying topsails\nand forecourse. Many were built in England or elsewhere purposely\nfor the business, without, of course, the knowledge of the builders,\nostensibly as yachts or traders. The Spaniards and Portuguese were the\nprincipal offenders, with occasionally an English-speaking renegade.\n\nThe slave depots, or barracoons, were generally located some miles up a\nriver. Here the slaver was secure from capture and could embark his live\ncargo at his leisure. Keeping a sharp lookout on the coast, the dealers\nwere able to follow the movements of the cruisers, and by means of\nsmoke, or in other ways, signal when the coast was clear for the coming\ndown the river and sailing of the loaded craft. Before taking in the\ncargoes they were always fortified with all the necessary papers and\ndocuments to show they were engaged in legitimate commerce, so it was\nonly when caught in flagrante delicto that we could hold them.\n\nWe had been cruising off the coast of Liberia doing nothing, when we\nwere ordered to the Gulf of Guinea to watch the Bonny and Cameroons\nmouths of the great Niger River. Our consort was H.M. schooner Bright,\na beautiful craft about our tonnage, but with half our crew, and able to\nsail three miles to our two. She was an old slaver, captured and adapted\nas a cruiser. She had been very successful, making several important\ncaptures of full cargoes, and twice or thrice her commanding officer\nand others had been promoted. Working our way slowly down the coast in\ncompany with the Bright, we would occasionally send a boat on shore to\nreconnoitre or gather any information we could from the natives through\nour Krooman interpreter. A few glasses of rum or a string of beads would\nloosen the tongue of almost any one. At Little Bonny we heard that\ntwo vessels were some miles up the river, ready to sail, and were only\nwaiting until the coast was clear. Captain James, of the Bright, thought\nthat one, if not both, would sail from another outlet of the river,\nabout thirty miles to the southward, and determined to watch it.\n\nWe both stood to that direction. Of course we were watched from the\nshore, and the slavers were kept posted as to our movements. They\nsupposed we had both gone to the Cameroons, leaving Little Bonny open;\nbut after dark, with a light land breeze, we wore round and stood to the\nnorthward, keeping offshore some distance, so that captains leaving the\nriver might have sufficient offing to prevent their reaching port again\nor beaching their craft. At daybreak, as far as we could judge, we were\nabout twenty miles offshore to the northward and westward of Little\nBonny, in the track of any vessel bound for the West Indies. The night\nwas dark with occasional rain squalls, when the heavens would open and\nthe water come down in a flood. Anxiously we all watched for daylight,\nwhich comes under the equator with a suddenness very different from the\nprolonged twilight of higher latitudes. At the first glimmer in the east\nevery eye was strained on the horizon, all eager, all anxious to be the\nfirst to sight anything within our vision. The darkness soon gave way to\ngray morn. Day was dawning, when suddenly a Krooman by my side seized\nmy hand and, without saying a word, pointed inshore. I looked, but\ncould see nothing. All eyes were focused in that direction, and in a few\nminutes the faint outline of a vessel appeared against the sky. She was\nsome miles inshore of us, and as the day brightened we made her out to\nbe a brigantine (an uncommon rig in those days), standing across\nour bows, with all studding sails set on the starboard side, indeed\neverything that could pull, including water sails and save-all. We were\non the same tack heading to the northward. We set everything that would\ndraw, and kept off two points, bringing the wind abeam so as to head her\noff.\n\nThe breeze was light and off the land. We had not yet been seen against\nthe darker western horizon, but we knew it could only be a few minutes\nlonger before their sharp eyes would make us out. Soon we saw the\nstudding sails and all kites come down by the run and her yards braced\nup sharp on the same tack as ours. We also hauled by the wind. At\nsunrise she was four points on our weather bow, distant about four\nmiles. We soon perceived that she could outsail our brig and if the wind\nheld would escape. Gradually she drew away from us until she was hull\ndown. Our only hope now was that the land breeze would cease and the sea\nbreeze come in. As the sun rose we gladly noticed the wind lessening,\nuntil at eleven o'clock it was calm. Not a breath ruffled the surface of\nthe sea; the sun's rays in the zenith were reflected as from a mirror;\nthe waters seemed like molten lead.\n\nI know of nothing more depressing than a calm in the tropics,--a raging\nsun overhead, around an endless expanse of dead sea, and a feeling of\nutter helplessness that is overpowering. What if this should last? what\na fate! The Rime of the Ancient Mariner comes to our mind. Come storm\nand tempest, come hurricanes and blizzards, anything but an endless\nstagnation. For some hours we watched earnestly the horizon to the\nwestward, looking for the first dark break on the smooth sea. Not a\ncloud was in the heavens. The brig appeared to be leaving us either by\ntowing or by sweeps; only her topgallant sail was above the horizon. It\nlooked as if the sea breeze would desert us. It usually came in about\none o'clock, but that hour and another had passed and yet we watched\nfor the first change. Without a breeze our chances of overhauling the\nstranger were gone. Only a white speck like the wing of a gull now\nmarked her whereabouts on the edge of the horizon, and in another hour\nshe would be invisible even from the masthead.\n\nWhen we were about to despair, our head Krooman drew the captain's\nattention to the westward and said the breeze was coming. We saw no\nsigns of it, but his quick eye had noticed light feathery clouds rising\nto the westward, a sure indication of the coming breeze. Soon we could\nsee the glassy surface ruffled at different points as the breeze danced\nover it, coming on like an advancing line of skirmishers; and as we felt\nits first gentle movement on our parched faces, it was welcome indeed,\nputting new life into all of us. The crew needed no encouragement to\nspring to their work. As the little brig felt the breeze and gathered\nsteerageway, she was headed for the chase, bringing the wind on her\nstarboard quarter. In less than five minutes all the studding sails that\nwould draw were set, as well as everything that would pull. The best\nquartermaster was sent to the wheel, with orders to keep the chase\ndirectly over the weather end of the spritsail yard. The captain ordered\nthe sails wet, an expedient I never had much faith in, unless the sails\nare very old. But as if to recompense us for the delay, the breeze came\nin strong and steady. Our one hope now was to follow it up close, and to\ncarry it within gunshot of the brig, for if she caught it before we\nwere within range she would certainly escape. All hands were piped to\nquarters, and the long eighteen-pounder on the forecastle was loaded\nwith a full service charge; on this piece we relied to cripple the\nchase. We were now rapidly raising her, and I was sent aloft on the fore\ntopsail yard, with a good glass to watch her movements. Her hull was\nin sight and she was still becalmed, though her head was pointed in the\nright direction, and everything was set to catch the coming breeze.\nShe carried a boat on each side at the davits like a man-of-war, and I\nreported that I could make out men securing them. They had been towing\nher, and only stopped when they saw us drawing near.\n\nAnxiously we watched the breeze on the water as it narrowed the sheen\nbetween us, and we were yet two miles or more distant when she first\nfelt the breeze. As she did so we hoisted the English blue ensign,--for\nthe fleet at this time was under a Rear Admiral of the Blue,--and fired\na weather gun, but no response was made. Fortunately the wind continued\nto freshen and the Porpoise was doing wonderfully well. We were rapidly\nclosing the distance between us. We fired another gun, but no attention\nwas paid to it. I noticed from the movements of the crew of the brig\nthat they were getting ready for some manoeuvre, and reported to the\ncaptain. He divined at once what the manoeuvre would be, and ordered the\nbraces be led along, hands by the studding-sail halyards and tacks,\nand everything ready to haul by the wind. We felt certain now of the\ncharacter of our friend, and the men were already calculating the amount\nof their prize money. We were now within range, and must clip her wings\nif possible.\n\nThe first lieutenant was ordered to open fire with the eighteen-pounder.\nCarefully the gun was laid, and as the order \"fire\" was given, down came\nour English flag, and the stop of the Stars and Stripes was broken\nat the gaff. The first shot touched the water abeam of the chase and\nricochetted ahead of her. She showed the Spanish flag. The captain of\nthe gun was ordered to elevate a little more and try again. The second\nshot let daylight through her fore topsail, but the third was wide\nagain.\n\nThen the sharp, quick order of the captain, \"Fore topsail yard there,\ncome down on deck, sir!\" brought me down on the run. \"Have both cutters\ncleared away and ready for lowering,\" were my orders as I reached the\nquarter-deck. Practice from the bow chasers continued, but the smoke\nthat drifted ahead of us interfered with the accuracy of the firing,\nand no vital part was touched, though a number of shots went through\nher sails. The captain in the main rigging never took his eye from the\nSpaniard, evidently expecting that as a fox when hard pressed doubles\non the hounds, the chase would attempt the same thing. And he was not\ndisappointed, for when we had come within easy range of her, the smoke\nhid her from view for a few minutes, and as it dispersed the first\nglimpse showed the captain that her studding sails had all gone, and\nthat she had hauled by the wind, standing across our weather bow. Her\ncaptain had lost no time in taking in his studding sails; halyards,\ntacks, and sheets had all been cut together and dropped overboard.\n\nIt was a bold and well-executed manoeuvre, and we could not help\nadmiring the skill with which she was handled. However, we had been\nprepared for this move. \"Ease down your helm.\" \"Lower away. Haul down\nthe studding sails.\" \"Ease away the weather braces. Brace up.\"\n\"Trim down the head sheets,\" were the orders which followed in rapid\nsuccession, and were as quickly executed. The Spaniard was now broad on\nour lee bow, distant not more than half a mile, but as she felt the wind\nwhich we brought down she fairly spun through the water, exposing her\nbright copper. She was both head-reaching and outsailing us; in half an\nhour she would have been right ahead of us, and in an hour the sun would\nbe down. It was now or never. We could bring nothing to bear except the\ngun on the forecastle. Fortunately it continued smooth, and we were no\nlonger troubled with smoke. Shot after shot went hissing through the air\nafter her; a number tore through the sails or rigging, but not a spar\nwas touched nor an important rope cut. We could see some of her crew\naloft reeving and stopping braces and ready to repair any damage done,\nworking as coolly under fire as old man-of-war's men. But while we were\nlooking, down came the gaff of her mainsail, and the gaff-topsail fell\nall adrift; a lucky shot had cut her peak halyards. Our crew cheered\nwith a will. \"Well done, Hobson; try it again!\" called the captain to\nthe boatswain's mate, who was captain of the gun.\n\nAfter the next shot, the topgallant yard swayed for a few minutes and\nfell forward. The order was given to cease firing; she was at our mercy.\nWe were rapidly nearing the chase, when she backed her topsail. We kept\noff, and when within easy range of the carronades \"hove to\" to windward.\nLieutenant Bukett was ordered to board her in the first cutter and\ntake charge. I followed in the second cutter, with orders to bring the\ncaptain on board with his papers. A few strokes sent us alongside of a\nbrig about our tonnage, but with a low rail and a flush deck. The\ncrew, some eighteen or twenty fine-looking seamen, were forward eagerly\ndiscussing the situation of affairs. The captain was aft with his two\nofficers, talking to Lieutenant Bukett. He was fair, with light hair\ncurling all over his head, beard cut short, about forty years of age,\nwell set up, with a frame like a Roman wrestler, evidently a tough\ncustomer in a rough-and-ready scrimmage.\n\nHe spoke fairly good English, and was violently denouncing the outrage\ndone to his flag; his government would demand instant satisfaction for\nfiring upon a legitimate trader on the high seas. I have the lieutenant\nCaptain Thompson's orders, to bring the captain and his papers on board\nat once. His harangue was cut short by orders to get on board my boat.\nHe swore with a terrible oath that he would never leave his vessel.\n\"Come on board, men,\" said I, and twenty of our crew were on deck in a\njiffy. I stationed my coxswain, Parker, at the cabin companion way with\norders to allow no one to pass. \"Now,\" said Lieutenant Bukett to the\nSpaniard, \"I will take you on board in irons unless you go quietly.\" He\nhesitated a moment, then said he would come as soon as he had gone below\nto bring up his papers. \"No, never mind your papers; I will find them,\"\nsaid the lieutenant, for he saw the devil in the Spaniard's eyes, and\nknew he meant mischief. Our captive made one bound for the companion\nway, however, and seizing Parker by the throat hurled him into the water\nways as if he had been a rag baby. But fortunately he slipped on a small\ngrating and fell on his knees, and before he could recover himself two\nof our men threw themselves upon him.\n\nI closed the companion way. The struggle was desperate for a few\nminutes, for the Spaniard seemed possessed of the furies, and his\nefforts were almost superhuman. Twice he threw the men from him across\nthe deck, but they were reinforced by Parker, who, smarting under his\ndiscomfiture, rushed in, determined to down him. I was anxious to end it\nwith my pistol, but Lieutenant Bukett would not consent. The Spaniard's\nofficers and men made some demonstration to assist, but they were\nquickly disposed of: his two mates were put in irons and the crew driven\nforward. Struggling, fighting, every limb and every muscle at work,\nthe captain was overpowered; a piece of the signal halyards brought his\nhands together, and handcuffs were slipped on his wrists. Only then he\nsuccumbed, and begged Lieutenant Bukett to blow out his brains, for he\nhad been treated like a pirate.\n\nWithout doubt if he had reached the cabin he would have blown up the\nvessel, for in a locker over the transom were two open kegs of powder.\nI led him to my boat, assisted him in, and returned to the Porpoise.\nAs soon as the Spaniard reached the deck the captain ordered his irons\nremoved, and expressed his regret that it had been necessary to use\nforce. The prisoner only bowed and said nothing. The captain asked him\nwhat his cargo consisted of. He replied, \"About four hundred blacks\nbound to the Brazils.\"\n\nI was then ordered to return to the brig, bring on board her crew,\nleaving only the cook and steward, and to take charge of the prize as\nLieutenant Bukett, our first lieutenant, was not yet wholly recovered\nfrom an attack of African fever. The crew of twenty men, when brought on\nboard, consisted of Spaniards, Greeks, Malays, Arabs, white and black,\nbut had not one Anglo-Saxon. They were ironed in pairs and put under\nguard.\n\nFrom the time we first got on board we had heard moans, cries, and\nrumblings coming from below, and as soon as the captain and crew were\nremoved, the hatches had been taken off, when there arose a hot blast as\nfrom a charnel house, sickening and overpowering. In the hold were three\nor four hundred human beings, gasping, struggling for breath, dying;\ntheir bodies, limbs, faces, all expressing terrible suffering. In their\nagonizing fight for life, some had torn or wounded themselves or\ntheir neighbors dreadfully; some were stiffened in the most unnatural\npositions. As soon as I knew the condition of things I sent the boat\nback for the doctor and some whiskey. It returned bringing Captain\nThompson, and for an hour or more we were all hard at work lifting and\nhelping the poor creatures on deck, where they were laid out in rows.\nA little water and stimulant revived most of them; some, however, were\ndead or too far gone to be resuscitated. The doctor worked earnestly\nover each one, but seventeen were beyond human skill. As fast as he\npronounced them dead they were quickly dropped overboard.\n\nNight closed in with our decks covered so thickly with the ebony bodies\nthat with difficulty we could move about; fortunately they were as quiet\nas so many snakes. In the meantime the first officer, Mr. Block, was\nsending up a new topgallant yard, reeving new rigging, repairing the\nsails, and getting everything ataunto aloft. The Kroomen were busy\nwashing out and fumigating the hold, getting ready for our cargo again.\nIt would have been a very anxious night, except that I felt relieved\nby the presence of the brig which kept within hail. Soon after daybreak\nCaptain Thompson came on board again, and we made a count of the\ncaptives as they were sent below; 188 men and boys, and 166 women and\ngirls. Seeing everything snug and in order the captain returned to the\nbrig, giving me final orders to proceed with all possible dispatch to\nMonrovia, Liberia, land the negroes, then sail for Porto Praya, Cape de\nVerde Islands, and report to the commodore. As the brig hauled to the\nwind and stood to the southward and eastward I dipped my colors, when\nher crew jumped into the rigging and gave us three cheers, which we\nreturned.\n\nAs she drew away from us I began to realize my position and\nresponsibility: a young midshipman, yet in my teens, commanding a prize,\nwith three hundred and fifty prisoners on board, two or three weeks'\nsail from port, with only a small crew. From the first I kept all hands\naft except two men on the lookout, and the weather was so warm that we\ncould all sleep on deck. I also ordered the men never to lay aside their\npistols or cutlasses, except when working aloft, but my chief reliance\nwas in my knowledge of the negro,--of his patient, docile disposition.\nBorn and bred a slave he never thought of any other condition, and he\naccepted the situation without a murmur. I had never heard of blacks\nrising or attempting to gain their freedom on board a slaver.\n\nMy charges were all of a deep black; from fifteen to twenty-five years\nof age, and, with a few exceptions, nude, unless copper or brass rings\non their ankles or necklaces of cowries can be described as articles of\ndress. All were slashed, or had the scars of branding on their foreheads\nand cheeks; these marks were the distinguishing features of different\ntribes or families. The men's hair had been cut short, and their heads\nlooked in some cases as if they had been shaven. The women, on the\ncontrary, wore their hair \"a la pompadour;\" the coarse kinky locks were\nsometimes a foot or more above their heads, and trained square or round\nlike a boxwood bush. Their features were of the pronounced African\ntype, but, notwithstanding this disfigurement, were not unpleasing in\nappearance. The figures of all were very good, straight, well developed,\nsome of the young men having bodies that would have graced a Mercury or\nan Apollo. Their hands were small, showing no evidences of work, only\nthe cruel marks of shackles. These in some cases had worn deep furrows\non their wrists or ankles.\n\nThey were obedient to all orders as far as they understood them, and\nwould, I believe, have jumped overboard if told to do so. I forbade the\nmen to treat them harshly or cruelly. I had the sick separated from the\nothers, and allowed them to remain on deck all the time, and in this way\nI partly gained their confidence. I was anxious to learn their story.\nFortunately one of the Kroomen found among the prisoners a native of\na tribe living near the coast, and with him as interpreter was able to\nmake himself understood. After a good deal of questioning I learned that\nmost of them were from a long distance in the interior, some having been\none and some two moons on the way, traveling partly by land and partly\nby river until they reached the coast. They had been sold by their kings\nor by their parents to the Arab trader for firearms or for rum. Once at\nthe depots near the coast, they were sold by the Arabs or other traders\nto the slave captains for from twenty-five to fifty dollars a head.\nIn the Brazils or West Indies they were worth from two to five hundred\ndollars. This wide margin, of course, attracted unscrupulous and greedy\nadventurers, who if they succeeded in running a few cargoes would enrich\nthemselves.\n\nOur daily routine was simple. At six in the morning the rope netting\nover the main hatch which admitted light and air was taken off, and\ntwenty-five of each sex were brought up, and seated in two circles, one\non each side of the deck. A large pan of boiled paddy was then placed\nin the centre by the cook and all went to work with their hands. A few\nminutes sufficed to dispose of every grain; then one of the Kroomen gave\neach of them a cup of water from a bucket. For half an hour after the\nmeal they had the liberty of the deck, except the poop, for exercise, to\nwash and to sun themselves; for sunshine to a negro is meat and drink.\nAt the end of this time they were sent below and another fifty brought\nup, and so on until all had been fed and watered. Paddy or rice was the\nstaple article of food. At dinner boiled yams were given with the\nrice. Our passengers were quartered on a flying deck extending from the\nforemast to a point twenty feet abaft the main hatch from which came\nlight and air. The height was about five feet; the men had one side and\nthe women the other. Of course there was no furnishing of any kind, but\nall lay prone upon the bare deck in rows.\n\nEvery morning after breakfast the Kroomen would rig the force pump,\nscrew on the hose and drench them all, washing out thoroughly between\ndecks. They appeared to enjoy this, and it was cooling, for be it\nremembered we were close under the equator, the thermometer dancing\nabout 90 deg. As the water was sluiced over them they would rub and\nscrub each other. Only the girls would try not to get their hair wet,\nfor they were at all times particular about their headdress. It may be\nthat this was the only part of their toilet that gave them any concern.\n\nThe winds were baffling and light, so we made but slow progress.\nFortunately frequent rains, with sometimes a genuine tropical downpour\nor cloud-burst, gave us an opportunity of replenishing our water casks,\nand by spreading the awnings we were able to get a good supply. I found\non inspection that there were at least thirty days' provisions on board,\nso on this score and that of water I felt easy. I lived on deck, seldom\nusing the cabin, which was a veritable arsenal, with racks of muskets\nand cutlasses on two sides, many more than the captain needed to arm his\ncrew, evidently intended for barter. Two or three prints of his\nfavorite saints, ornamented with sharks' teeth, hung on one bulkhead. A\nwell-thrummed mandolin and a number of French novels proved him to be\na musical and literary fellow, who could probably play a bolero while\nmaking a troublesome slave walk a plank. I found also some choice\nvintages from the Douro and Bordeaux snugly stowed in his spirit locker,\nwhich proved good medicines for some of our captives, who required\nstimulants. Several of the girls were much reduced, refused nearly all\nfood, and were only kept alive by a little wine and water. Two finally\ndied of mere inanition. Their death did not in the least affect their\nfellows, who appeared perfectly indifferent and callous to all their\nsurroundings, showing not the least sympathy or desire to help or wait\non one another.\n\nThe fifth day after parting from the brig we encountered a tropical\nstorm. The sun rose red and angry, and owing to the great refraction\nappeared three times its natural size. It climbed lazily to the zenith,\nand at noon we were shadowless. The sky was as calm as a vault, and\nthe surface of the water was like burnished steel. The heat became so\nstifling that even the Africans were gasping for breath, and we envied\nthem their freedom from all impediments. The least exertion was irksome,\nand attended with extreme lassitude. During the afternoon thin cirri\nclouds, flying very high, spread out over the western heavens like a\nfan. As the day lengthened they thickened to resemble the scales of\na fish, bringing to mind the old saying, \"A mackerel sky and a mare's\ntail,\" etc. The signs were all unmistakable, and even the gulls\nrecognized a change, and, screaming, sought shelter on our spars. Mr.\nBlock was ordered to send down all the light yards and sails; to take\nin and furl everything, using storm gaskets, except on the fore and main\nstorm staysails; to lash everything on deck; to batten down the hatches,\nexcept one square of the main; see all the shifting boards in place, so\nthat our living cargo would not be thrown to leeward higgledy-piggledy,\nand to take four or five of the worst cases of the sick into the cabin\nand lay them on the floor.\n\nThe sun disappeared behind a mountainous mass of leaden-colored\nclouds which rose rapidly in the southern and western quarters. To the\neastward, also, the signs were threatening. Night came on suddenly as it\ndoes in the tropics. Soon the darkness enveloped us, a palpable veil. A\nnoise like the march of a mighty host was heard, which proved to be the\napproach of a tropical flood, heralded by drops as large as marbles. It\nchurned the still waters into a phosphorescent foam which rendered the\ndarkness only more oppressive. The rain came down as it can come only\nin the Bight of Benin. The avalanche cooled us, reducing the temperature\nten or fifteen degrees, giving us new life, and relieving our fevered\nblood. I told Mr. Block to throw back the tarpaulin over the main hatch\nand let our dusky friends get some benefit of it. In half an hour the\nrain ceased, but it was as calm and ominous as ever.\n\nI knew this was but the forerunner of something worse to follow, and we\nhad not long to wait, for suddenly a blinding flash of lightning darted\nthrough the gloom from east to west, followed by one in the opposite\ndirection. Without intermission, one blaze after another and thunder\ncrashing until our eyes were blinded and our ears deafened, a thousand\ntimes ten thousand pieces of artillery thundered away. We seemed utterly\nhelpless and insignificant. \"How wonderful are Thy works,\" came to my\nmind. Still no wind; the brig lay helpless.\n\nSuddenly, as a slap in the face, the wind struck us,--on the starboard\nquarter, fortunately. \"Hard-a-starboard.\" \"Hanl aft port fore staysail\nsheet,\" I called. But before she could gather way she was thrown down by\nthe wind like a reed. She was \"coming to\" instead of \"going off,\" and\nI tried to get the main storm staysail down but could not make myself\nheard. She was lying on her broadside. Luckily the water was smooth as\nyet. The main staysail shot out of the boltropes with a report like a\ntwelve-pounder, and this eased her so that if the fore staysail would\nonly hold she would go off. For a few minutes all we could do was to\nhold on, our lee rail in the water; but the plucky little brig rallied\na little, her head went off inch by inch, and as she gathered way she\nrighted, and catching the wind on our quarter we were off like a shot\nout of a gun. I knew we were too near the vortex of the disturbance for\nthe wind to hang long in one quarter, so watched anxiously for a change.\nThe sea rose rapidly while we were running to the northward on her\ncourse, and after a lull of a few minutes the wind opened from the\neastward, butt end foremost, a change of eight points. Nothing was to\nbe done but heave to, and this in a cross sea where pitch, weather roll,\nlee lurch, followed one another in such earnest that it was a wonder her\nmasts were not switched out of her.\n\nI passed an anxious night, most concerned about the poor creatures under\nhatches, whose sufferings must have been terrible. To prevent their\nsuffocating I kept two men at the main hatch with orders to lift one\ncorner of the tarpaulin whenever possible, even if some water did go\nbelow. Toward morning the wind and the sea went down rapidly, and as the\nsun rose it chased the clouds off, giving us the promise of a fine day.\nWhen the cook brought me a cup of coffee, I do not know that I ever\nenjoyed anything more. Hatches off, I jumped down into the hold to look\nafter my prisoners. Battered and bruised they lay around in heaps.\nOnly the shifting boards had kept them from being beaten into an\nindistinguishable mass. As fast as possible they were sent on deck, and\nthe sun's rays, with a few buckets of water that were thrown over them,\naccomplished wonders in bringing them to life and starting them to care\nfor their sore limbs and bruises.\n\nOne boy, when I motioned for him to go on deck, pointed quietly to\nhis leg, and upon examination I found a fracture just above the knee.\nSwelling had already commenced. I had seen limbs set, and had some rough\nidea how it should be done. So while getting some splints of keg staves\nand bandages ready, I kept a stream of water pouring on the fracture,\nand then ordered two men to pull the limb in place, and it took all\ntheir strength. That done I put on the splints and wrapped the bandages\ntightly. Three weeks later I landed him in a fair way of recovery.\n\nGradually I allowed a larger number of the blacks to remain on deck,\na privilege which they greatly enjoyed. To lie basking in the sun like\nsaurians, half sleeping, half waking, appeared to satisfy all their\nwishes. They were perfectly docile and obedient, and not by word,\ngesture, or look did they express any dissatisfaction with orders given\nthem. But again for any little acts of kindness they expressed no kind\nof appreciation or gratitude. Physically they were men and women, but\notherwise as far removed from the Anglo-Saxon as the oyster from the\nbaboon, or the mole from the horse.\n\nOn the fourteenth day from parting with the brig we made the palms\non Cape Mesurado, the entrance to Monrovia Harbor. A light sea breath\nwafted us to the anchorage, a mile from the town, and when the anchor\ndropped from the bows and the chain ran through the hawse pipe, it was\nsweet music to my ears; for the strain had been great, and I felt years\nolder than when I parted from my messmates. A great responsibility\nseemed lifted from my shoulders, and I enjoyed a long and refreshing\nsleep for the first time in a fortnight. At nine the next morning I went\non shore and reported to the authorities, the officials of Liberia, of\nwhich Monrovia is the capital.\n\nThis part of the African coast had been selected by the United States\ngovernment as the home of emancipated slaves; for prior to the abolition\nexcitement which culminated in the war, numbers of slaves in the South\nhad been manumitted by their masters with the understanding that\nthey should be deported to Liberia, and the Colonization Society, an\ninfluential body, comprising some of the leading men, like Madison,\nWebster, and Clay, had assisted in the same work. The passages of the\nnegroes were paid; each family was given a tract of land and sufficient\nmeans to build a house. Several thousand had been sent out, most of whom\nhad settled at Monrovia, and a few at other places on the coast. They\nhad made no impression on the natives. On the contrary, many of them had\nintermarried with the natives, and the off-spring of these unions had\nlost the use of the English tongue, and had even gone back to the life\nand customs of their ancestors, sans clothing, sans habitations, and\nworship of a fetich.\n\nOf course there were some notable exceptions, especially President\nRoberts, who proved himself a safe and prudent ruler, taking into\nconsideration his surroundings and the material with which he had\nto work. The form of government was modeled after that of the United\nStates, but it was top-heavy. Honorables, colonels, and judges were\nthicker than in Georgia. Only privates were scarce; for nothing delights\na negro more than a little show or a gaudy uniform. On landing I was\nmet by a dark mulatto, dressed in a straw hat, blue tail coat, silver\nepaulettes, linen trousers, with bare feet, and a heavy cavalry sabre\nhanging by his side. With him were three or four others in the same rig,\nexcept the epaulettes. He introduced himself as Colonel Harrison, chief\nof police. I asked to be directed to the custom house.\n\nThe collector proved to be an old negro from Raleigh, N. C., gray as a\nbadger, spectacled, with manners of Lord Grandison and language of Mrs.\nMalaprop. I reported my arrival, and asked permission to land my cargo\nas soon as possible. He replied that in a matter of so much importance,\ndevolving questions of momentous interest, it would be obligatory on him\nto consult the Secretary of the Treasury. I said I trusted he would so\nfacilitate affairs that I might at an early hour disembarrass myself\nof my involuntary prisoners. I returned on board, and the day passed\nwithout any answer. The next morning I determined to go at once to\nheadquarters and find out the cause of the delay by calling on the\nPresident.\n\nHe received me without any formality. I made my case as strong as\npossible, and pressed for an immediate answer. In reply he assured me\nhe would consult with other members of his cabinet, and give me a final\nanswer the next morning. That evening I dined with him en famille, and\nrecognized some old Virginia dishes on the table. The next morning I\nwaited impatiently for his decision, having made up my mind however, if\nit was unfavorable, to land my poor captives, be the consequences what\nthey might.\n\nAbout eleven o'clock a boat came off with an officer in full uniform,\nwho introduced himself as Colonel Royal, bearer of dispatches from his\nExcellency the President. He handed me a letter couched in diplomatic\nlanguage, as long as some of his brother presidents' messages on this\nside of the Atlantic. I had hardly patience to read it. The gist of it\nwas, I might not land the captives at Monrovia, but might land them\nat Grand Bassa, about a hundred and fifty miles to the eastward; that\nColonel Royal would accompany me with orders to the governor there to\nreceive them. This was something I had not anticipated, and outside of\nmy instructions. However, I thought it best to comply with the wishes of\nthe government of our only colony.\n\nGetting under way we stood to the southward and eastward, taking\nadvantage of the light land and sea breeze, keeping the coast close\naboard. The colonel had come on board without any impediments, and\nI wondered if he intended to make the voyage in his cocked hat,\nepaulettes, sword, etc. But soon after we had started he disappeared\nand emerged from the cabin bareheaded, barefooted, and without clothing\nexcept a blue dungaree shirt and trousers. Like a provident negro,\nhaving stowed away all his trappings, he appeared as a roustabout on a\nWestern steamer. But he had not laid aside with his toggery any of his\nimportant and consequential airs. He ran foul of Mr. Block, who called\nhim Mr. Cuffy, and ordered him to give him a pull with the main sheet.\nThe colonel complained to me that he was not addressed by his name or\ntitle, and that he was not treated as a representative of his government\nshould be. I reprimanded Mr. Block, and told him to give the visitor all\nhis title. \"All right, sir, but the colonel must keep off the weather\nside of the deck,\" growled the officer. The cook, the crew, and even the\nKroomen, all took their cue from the first officer, and the colonel's\nlot was made most unhappy.\n\nOn the third day we reached Grand Bassa, and anchored off the beach\nabout two miles, along which the surf was breaking so high that any\nattempt to land would be hazardous. Toward evening it moderated, and\na canoe with three naked natives came off. One I found could speak a\nlittle English. I told him to say to the governor that I would come on\nshore in the morning and see him, and land my cargo at the same time.\n\nThe next morning at sunrise we were boarded by a party of natives headed\nby one wearing a black hat half covered with a tarnished silver band,\nan old navy frock coat, much too small, between the buttons of which\nhis well-oiled skin showed clearly. A pair of blue flannel trousers\ncompleted his outfit. An interpreter introduced him as King George of\nGrand Bassa. With him were about a dozen followers, each one wearing\na different sort of garment--and seldom more than a single\none--representing old uniforms of many countries. Two coats I noticed\nwere buttoned up the back.\n\nThe king began by saying that he was and always had been a friend of the\nAmericans; that he was a big man, had plenty of men and five wives, etc.\nWhile he was speaking, a white-bearded old colored gentleman came\nover the gangway, dressed in a linen roundabout and trousers, with a\nwide-brimmed straw hat. At the same time Colonel Royal came up from\nthe cabin in grande tenue and introduced us to the Hon. Mr. Marshall,\ngovernor of Bassa, formerly of Kentucky.\n\nIn a few minutes he explained the situation. With a few settlers he\nwas located at this place, on the frontier of the colony, and they were\nthere on sufferance only from the natives. I told him Colonel Royal\nwould explain my mission to him and the king. The colonel, bowing low to\nthe king, the governor, and myself, and bringing his sword down with a\nthud on the deck, drew from between the bursting buttons of his coat\nthe formidable document I had seen at Monrovia, and with most impressive\nvoice and gesture commenced to read it. The king listened for a few\nminutes, and then interrupted him. I asked the interpreter what he said.\nHe replied, \"King say he fool nigger; if he comes on shore he give him\nto Voodoo women.\" Then turning his back he walked forward. The colonel\ndropped his paper, and drawing his sword, in the most dramatic manner\nclaimed protection in the name of the government, declaring that he had\nbeen insulted. I told him to keep cool, since he was certainly safe\nas long as he was on board my ship. He grumbled and muttered terrible\nthings, but subsided gradually like the departing thunder of a summer\nstorm.\n\nI arranged the landing of the passengers with Governor Marshall, whom I\nfound a sensible, clear-headed old man, ready to cooperate in every\nway. But he suggested that I had better consult the king before doing\nanything. I did so, and he at once said they could not land. I told\nthe interpreter to say they would be landed at once and put under the\nprotection of the governor; that if the king or his people hurt them\nor ran them off I would report it to our commodore, who would certainly\npunish him severely. Finding me determined, he began to temporize, and\nasked that the landing be put off until the next day, that he might\nconsult with his head people, for if I sent them on shore before he had\ndone so they would kill them. \"If that is the case,\" I replied, \"I will\nhold you on board as a hostage for their good behavior.\" This threat\nsurprised him, and he changed his tactics. After a little powwow with\nsome of his followers, he said that if I would give him fifty muskets,\ntwenty pounds of powder, the colonel's sword, and some red cloth for his\nwives, I might land them. I replied that I had not a musket to spare\nnor an ounce of powder, that the colonel was a high officer of his\ngovernment, and that he of course would not give up his uniform.\nFortunately the colonel had retired to the cabin and did not hear this\nmodest demand, or he would have been as much outraged as if his sable\nMajesty had asked for him to be served \"roti a l'Ashantee.\" However, I\ntold the king I would send his wives some cloth and buttons. He grunted\nhis approval but returned again to the charge, and asked that he might\nchoose a few of the captives for his own use, before landing. \"Certainly\nnot,\" I answered, \"neither on board nor on shore,\" and added that he\nwould be held accountable for their good treatment as free men and\nwomen. He left thoroughly disappointed and bent on mischief.\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Block had made all preparations for landing, and had\nthe boats lowered and ranged alongside, with sufficient rice to last the\nblacks a week or ten days. The men and boys were sent first. When they\nwere called up from the hold and ordered into the boats not one of them\nmoved. They evidently divined what had been going on and dreaded leaving\nthe vessel, though our Kroomen tried to explain that they would be safe\nand free on shore. The explanation was without effect, however, and\nthey refused to move. The could only understand that they were changing\nmasters, and they preferred the present ones. Sending three or four men\ndown, I told them to pass up the negroes one at a time. Only a passive\nresistance was offered, such as one often sees exhibited by cattle being\nloaded on the cars or on a steamer, and were silent, not uttering a word\nof complaint. By noon the men were all on shore, and then we began with\nthe girls. They were more demonstrative than the men, and by their looks\nand gestures begged not to be taken out of the vessel. I was much moved,\nfor it was a painful duty, and I had become interested in these beings,\nso utterly helpless, so childlike in their dependence on those around\nthem. And I could not help thinking what their fate would be, thrown\nupon the shore hundreds of miles from their homes, and among a people\nstrange to them in language.\n\nEven Mr. Block was deeply stirred. \"He had not shipped,\" he said, \"for\nsuch work.\" I went to my cabin and left him in charge. In the course\nof an hour he reported, \"All ashore, sir.\" I told him to have the gig\nmanned and I would go on shore with Colonel Royal, and get a receipt\nfrom Governor Marshall for my late cargo. The colonel declined to\naccompany me, alleging sickness and requesting me to get the necessary\npapers signed. No doubt he felt safer on board than within reach of King\nGeorge.\n\nWe landed through the surf on a sandy beach, on which the waves of the\nAtlantic were fretting. Near by was a thick grove of cocoanut trees,\nunder which in groups of four and five were those who had just been\nlanded. They were seated on the ground, their heads resting on their\nknees, in a position of utter abnegation, surrounded by three or four\nhundred chattering savages of all ages, headed by the king. With the\nexception of him and a few of his head men, the clothing of the company\nwould not have covered a rag baby. They were no doubt discussing the\nappearance of the strangers and making their selections.\n\nI found the governor's house and the houses of the few settlers some\ndistance back on a slight elevation. The governor was comfortably,\nthough plainly situated, with a large family around him. He gave me a\nreceipt for the number of blacks landed, but said it would be impossible\nfor him to prevent the natives from taking and enslaving them. I agreed\nwith him, and said he must repeat to the king what I had told him. Then\nbidding him good-by I returned on board, sad and weary as one often\nfeels after being relieved of a great burden. At the same time I\nwondered whether the fate of these people would have been any worse if\nthe captain of the slaver had succeeded in landing them in the Brazils\nor the West Indies. Sierra Leone being a crown colony, the English could\nland all their captives there and provide for them until they were able\nto work for themselves. In this respect they had a great advantage over\nus.\n\nGetting under way, I proceeded to Monrovia to land Colonel Royal,\nand then to Porto Praya, our squadron's headquarters. There I found\nCommodore Gregory in the flagship corvette Portsmouth, and reported to\nhim. Soon after the Porpoise came in, and I joined my old craft, giving\nup my command of the captured slaver rather reluctantly.\n\n\n\n\nMR. CHARLES W. CHESNUTT'S STORIES by W. D. Howells\n\n\nThe critical reader of the story called The Wife of his Youth, which\nappeared in these pages two years ago, must have noticed uncommon traits\nin what was altogether a remarkable piece of work. The first was the\nnovelty of the material; for the writer dealt not only with people who\nwere not white, but with people who were not black enough to contrast\ngrotesquely with white people,--who in fact were of that near approach\nto the ordinary American in race and color which leaves, at the\nlast degree, every one but the connoisseur in doubt whether they are\nAnglo-Saxon or Anglo-African. Quite as striking as this novelty of\nthe material was the author's thorough mastery of it, and his\nunerring knowledge of the life he had chosen in its peculiar racial\ncharacteristics. But above all, the story was notable for the\npassionless handling of a phase of our common life which is tense with\npotential tragedy; for the attitude, almost ironical, in which the\nartist observes the play of contesting emotions in the drama under his\neyes; and for his apparently reluctant, apparently helpless consent\nto let the spectator know his real feeling in the matter. Any one\naccustomed to study methods in fiction, to distinguish between good and\nbad art, to feel the joy which the delicate skill possible only from\na love of truth can give, must have known a high pleasure in the quiet\nself-restraint of the performance; and such a reader would probably have\ndecided that the social situation in the piece was studied wholly from\nthe outside, by an observer with special opportunities for knowing it,\nwho was, as it were, surprised into final sympathy.\n\nNow, however, it is known that the author of this story is of negro\nblood,--diluted, indeed, in such measure that if he did not admit this\ndescent few would imagine it, but still quite of that middle world\nwhich lies next, though wholly outside, our own. Since his first story\nappeared he has contributed several others to these pages, and he now\nmakes a showing palpable to criticism in a volume called The Wife of\nhis Youth, and Other Stories of the Color Line; a volume of Southern\nsketches called The Conjure Woman; and a short life of Frederick\nDouglass, in the Beacon Series of biographies. The last is a simple,\nsolid, straight piece of work, not remarkable above many other\nbiographical studies by people entirely white, and yet important as\nthe work of a man not entirely white treating of a great man of his\ninalienable race. But the volumes of fiction ARE remarkable above many,\nabove most short stories by people entirely white, and would be worthy\nof unusual notice if they were not the work of a man not entirely white.\n\nIt is not from their racial interest that we could first wish to speak\nof them, though that must have a very great and very just claim upon the\ncritic. It is much more simply and directly, as works of art, that\nthey make their appeal, and we must allow the force of this quite\nindependently of the other interest. Yet it cannot always be allowed.\nThere are times in each of the stories of the first volume when the\nsimplicity lapses, and the effect is as of a weak and uninstructed\ntouch. There are other times when the attitude, severely impartial and\nstudiously aloof, accuses itself of a little pompousness. There are\nstill other times when the literature is a little too ornate for beauty,\nand the diction is journalistic, reporteristic. But it is right to add\nthat these are the exceptional times, and that for far the greatest part\nMr. Chesnutt seems to know quite as well what he wants to do in a given\ncase as Maupassant, or Tourguenief, or Mr. James, or Miss Jewett, or\nMiss Wilkins, in other given cases, and has done it with an art of\nkindred quiet and force. He belongs, in other words, to the good school,\nthe only school, all aberrations from nature being so much truancy and\nanarchy. He sees his people very clearly, very justly, and he shows them\nas he sees them, leaving the reader to divine the depth of his feeling\nfor them. He touches all the stops, and with equal delicacy in stories\nof real tragedy and comedy and pathos, so that it would be hard to say\nwhich is the finest in such admirably rendered effects as The Web of\nCircumstance, The Bouquet, and Uncle Wellington's Wives. In some\nothers the comedy degenerates into satire, with a look in the reader's\ndirection which the author's friend must deplore.\n\nAs these stories are of our own time and country, and as there is not a\nswashbuckler of the seventeenth century, or a sentimentalist of this, or\na princess of an imaginary kingdom, in any of them, they will possibly\nnot reach half a million readers in six months, but in twelve months\npossibly more readers will remember them than if they had reached the\nhalf million. They are new and fresh and strong, as life always is,\nand fable never is; and the stories of The Conjure Woman have a wild,\nindigenous poetry, the creation of sincere and original imagination,\nwhich is imparted with a tender humorousness and a very artistic\nreticence. As far as his race is concerned, or his sixteenth part of\na race, it does not greatly matter whether Mr. Chesnutt invented their\nmotives, or found them, as he feigns, among his distant cousins of the\nSouthern cabins. In either case, the wonder of their beauty is the same;\nand whatever is primitive and sylvan or campestral in the reader's\nheart is touched by the spells thrown on the simple black lives in these\nenchanting tales. Character, the most precious thing in fiction, is as\nfaithfully portrayed against the poetic background as in the setting of\nthe Stories of the Color Line.\n\nYet these stories, after all, are Mr. Chesnutt's most important work,\nwhether we consider them merely as realistic fiction, apart from their\nauthor, or as studies of that middle world of which he is naturally\nand voluntarily a citizen. We had known the nethermost world of the\ngrotesque and comical negro and the terrible and tragic negro through\nthe white observer on the outside, and black character in its lyrical\nmoods we had known from such an inside witness as Mr. Paul Dunbar; but\nit had remained for Mr. Chesnutt to acquaint us with those regions where\nthe paler shades dwell as hopelessly, with relation to ourselves, as the\nblackest negro. He has not shown the dwellers there as very different\nfrom ourselves. They have within their own circles the same social\nambitions and prejudices; they intrigue and truckle and crawl, and are\nsnobs, like ourselves, both of the snobs that snub and the snobs that\nare snubbed. We may choose to think them droll in their parody of pure\nwhite society, but perhaps it would be wiser to recognize that they\nare like us because they are of our blood by more than a half, or three\nquarters, or nine tenths. It is not, in such cases, their negro blood\nthat characterizes them; but it is their negro blood that excludes them,\nand that will imaginably fortify them and exalt them. Bound in that sad\nsolidarity from which there is no hope of entrance into polite white\nsociety for them, they may create a civilization of their own, which\nneed not lack the highest quality. They need not be ashamed of the race\nfrom which they have sprung, and whose exile they share; for in many of\nthe arts it has already shown, during a single generation of freedom,\ngifts which slavery apparently only obscured. With Mr. Booker Washington\nthe first American orator of our time, fresh upon the time of Frederick\nDouglass; with Mr. Dunbar among the truest of our poets; with Mr.\nTanner, a black American, among the only three Americans from whom\nthe French government ever bought a picture, Mr. Chesnutt may well be\nwilling to own his color.\n\nBut that is his personal affair. Our own more universal interest in\nhim arises from the more than promise he has given in a department of\nliterature where Americans hold the foremost place. In this there is,\nhappily, no color line; and if he has it in him to go forward on the way\nwhich he has traced for himself, to be true to life as he has known\nit, to deny himself the glories of the cheap success which awaits the\ncharlatan in fiction, one of the places at the top is open to him. He\nhas sounded a fresh note, boldly, not blatantly, and he has won the ear\nof the more intelligent public.\n\n\n\n\nPATHS OF HOPE FOR THE NEGRO by Jerome Dowd\n\nPRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS OF A SOUTHERNER\n\n\nIt is too late in the day to discuss whether it would have been better\nhad the Negro never been brought into the Southern States. If his\npresence here has been beneficial, or is ever to prove so, the price of\nthe benefit has already been dearly paid for. He was the occasion of the\ndeadliest and most expensive war in modern times. In the next place, his\npresence has corrupted politics and has limited statesmanship to a mere\nquestion of race supremacy. Great problems concerning the political,\nindustrial, and moral life of the people have been subordinated or\novershadowed, so that, while important strides have been made elsewhere\nin the investigation of social conditions and in the administration of\nState and municipal affairs, in civil-service reform, in the management\nof penal and charitable institutions, and in the field of education, the\nSouth has lagged behind.\n\nOn the charts of illiteracy and crime the South is represented by an\nimmense black spot. Such are a few items of the account. It will require\nmillions more of dollars and generations more of earnest work before the\ntotal cost is met of bringing the black man to this side of the globe.\nBut the debt has been incurred and must be liquidated.\n\nThe welfare of the Negro is bound up with that of the white man in many\nimportant particulars:\n\nFirst, the low standard of living among the blacks keeps down the wages\nof all classes of whites. So long as the Negroes are content to live in\nmiserable huts, wear rags, and subsist upon hog fat and cow-pease, so\nlong must the wages of white people in the same kind of work be pressed\ntoward the same level. The higher we raise the standard of living among\nthe Negroes, the higher will be the wages of the white people in the\nsame occupations. The low standard of the Negroes is the result of low\nproductive power. The less intelligent and skilled the Negroes are, the\nless they can produce, whether working for themselves or others, and\nhence, the less will be the total wealth of the country.\n\nBut it may be asked, When the standard of living of the Negroes is\nraised, will not wages go up, and will not that be a drawback? Certainly\nwages will go up, because the income of all classes will be increased.\nHigh wages generally indicate high productive power and general wealth,\nwhile low wages indicate the opposite. Only benefits can arise from\nbetter wages.\n\nIn the next place, the Negro's propensity to crime tends to excite the\ncriminal tendencies of the white man. The South enjoys the distinction\nof having the highest percentage of crime in all the civilized world,\nand the reason is that the crimes of the one race provoke counter-crimes\nin the other.\n\nThe physical well-being of the one race has such a conspicuous influence\nupon that of the other that the subject requires no elaboration. The\nuncleanliness of person and habits of the Negroes in their homes and\nin the homes of their employers tends to propagate diseases, and thus\nimpairs the health and increases the death-rate of the whole population.\n\nAgain, the lack of refinement in intellect, manners, and dress among the\nNegroes is an obstacle to the cultivated life of the whites. Ignorance\nand the absence of taste and self-respect in servants result in badly\nkept homes and yards, destruction of furniture and ware, ill-prepared\nfood, poor table service, and a general lowering of the standard of\nliving. Furthermore, the corrupt, coarse, and vulgar language of the\nNegroes is largely responsible for the jumbled and distorted English\nspoken by many of the Southern whites.\n\nSeeing that the degradation of the Negro is an impediment to the\nprogress and civilization of the white man, how may we effect an\nimprovement in his condition?\n\nFirst, municipalities should give more attention to the streets and\nalleys that traverse Negro settlements. In almost every town in the\nSouth there are settlements, known by such names as \"New Africa,\"\n\"Haiti,\" \"Log Town,\" \"Smoky Hollow,\" or \"Snow Hill,\" exclusively\ninhabited by Negroes. These settlements are often outside the corporate\nlimits. The houses are built along narrow, crooked, and dirty lanes,\nand the community is without sanitary regulations or oversight. These\nquarters should be brought under municipal control, the lanes widened\ninto streets and cleaned, and provision made to guard against the\nopening of similar ones in the future.\n\nIn the next place, property-owners should build better houses for the\nNegroes to live in. The weakness in the civilization of the Negroes is\nmost pronounced in their family life. But improvement in this respect is\nnot possible without an improvement in the character and the comforts\nof the houses they live in. Bad houses breed bad people and bad\nneighborhoods. There is no more distinctive form of crime than the\nbuilding and renting of houses unfit for human habitation.\n\nScarcely second in importance to improvements in house architecture\nis the need among Negroes of more time to spend with their families.\nEmployers of Negro labor should be less exacting in the number of hours\nrequired for a day's work. Many domestic servants now work from six in\nthe morning until nine and ten o'clock at night. The Southern habit\nof keeping open shopping-places until late at night encourages late\nsuppers, retains cooks, butlers, and nurses until bedtime, and robs\nthem of all home life. If the merchants would close their shops at six\no'clock, as is the custom in the North, the welfare of both races would\nbe greatly promoted.\n\nAgain, a revolution is needed in the character of the Negro's religion.\nAt present it is too largely an affair of the emotions. He needs to\nbe taught that the religious life is something to grow into by the\nperfection of personality, and not to be jumped into or sweated into\nat camp-meetings. The theological seminaries and the graduate preachers\nshould assume the task of grafting upon the religion of the Negro that\nmuch sanity at least.\n\nA reform is as much needed in the methods and aims of Negro education.\nUp to the present Negro education has shared with that of the white man\nthe fault of being top-heavy. Colleges and universities have developed\nout of proportion to, and at the expense of, common schools. Then,\nthe kind of education afforded the Negro has not been fitted to his\ncapacities and needs. He has been made to pursue courses of study\nparallel to those prescribed for the whites, as though the individuals\nof both races had to fill the same positions in life. Much of the\nNegro's education has had nothing to do with his real life-work. It\nhas only made him discontented and disinclined to unfold his arms. The\nsurvival of the Negroes in the race for existence depends upon their\nretaining possession of the few bread-winning occupations now open to\nthem. But instead of better qualifying themselves for these occupations\nthey have been poring over dead languages and working problems in\nmathematics. In the meantime the Chinaman and the steam-laundry have\nabolished the Negro's wash-tub, trained white \"tonsorial artists\" have\ntaken away his barber's chair, and skilled painters and plasterers and\nmechanics have taken away his paint-brushes and tool-chests. Every year\nthe number of occupations open to him becomes fewer because of his lack\nof progress in them. Unless a radical change takes place in the scope of\nhis education, so that he may learn better how to do his work, a tide of\nwhite immigration will set in and force him out of his last stronghold,\ndomestic service, and limit his sphere to the farm.\n\nAll primary schools for the Negroes should be equipped for industrial\ntraining in such work as sewing, cooking, laundering, carpentry, and\nhouse-cleaning, and, in rural districts, in elementary agriculture.\n\nSecondary schools should add to the literary courses a more advanced\ncourse in industrial training, so as to approach as nearly as possible\nthe objects and methods of the Tuskegee and Hampton Industrial and\nNormal Schools. Too much cannot be said in behalf of the revolution in\nthe life of the Negro which the work of these schools promises and, in\npart, has already wrought. The writer is fully aware that education has\na value aside from and above its bread-winning results, and he would\nnot dissuade the Negro from seeking the highest culture that he may be\ncapable of; but it is folly for him to wing his way through the higher\nrealms of the intellect without some acquaintance with the requirements\nand duties of life.\n\nChanges are needed in the methods of Negro education as well as in its\nscope. Educators should take into account, more than they have yet done,\nthe differences in the mental characteristics of the two races. It is\na well-established fact that, while the lower races possess marked\ncapacity to deal with simple, concrete ideas, they lack power of\ngeneralization, and soon fatigue in the realm of the abstract. It\nis also well known that the inferior races, being deficient in\ngeneralization, which is a subjective process, are absorbed almost\nentirely in the things that are objective. They have strong and alert\neyesight, and are susceptible to impressions through the medium of the\neye to an extent that is impossible to any of the white races. This fact\nis evidenced in the great number of pictures found in the homes of the\nNegroes. In default of anything better, they will paper their walls with\nadvertisements of the theater and the circus, and even with pictures\nfrom vicious newspapers. They delight in street pageantry, fancy\ncostumes, theatrical performances, and similar spectacles. Factories\nemploying Negroes generally find it necessary to suspend operations on\n\"circus day.\" They love stories of adventure and any fiction that gives\nplay to their imaginations. All their tastes lie in the realm of the\nobjective and the concrete.\n\nHence, in the school-room stress should be laid on those studies that\nappeal to the eye and the imagination. Lessons should be given in\nsketching, painting, drawing, and casting. Reprints of the popular works\nof art should be placed before the Negroes, that their love for art\nmay be gratified and their taste cultivated at the same time. Fancy\nneedlework, dress-making, and home decorations should also have an\nimportant place. These studies, while not contributing directly to\nbread-winning, have a refining and softening influence upon character,\nand inspire efforts to make the home more attractive. The more interest\nwe can make the Negro take in his personal appearance and in the\ncomforts of his home, the more we shall strengthen and promote his\nfamily life and raise the level of his civilization.\n\nThe literary education of the Negro should consist of carefully selected\npoems and novels that appeal to his imagination and produce clear\nimages upon his mind, excluding such literature as is in the nature of\npsychological or moral research. Recitations and dialogues should be\nmore generally and more frequently required. In history emphasis should\nbe given to what is picturesque, dramatic, and biographical.\n\nComing to the political phase of the Negro problem, there is a general\nagreement among white men that the Southern States cannot keep pace\nwith the progress of the world as long as they are menaced by Negro\ndomination, and that, therefore, it is necessary to eliminate the Negro\nvote from politics. When the Negroes become intelligent factors in\nsociety, when they become thrifty and accumulate wealth, they will\nfind the way to larger exercise of citizenship. They can never sit upon\njuries to pass upon life and property until they are property-owners\nthemselves, and they can never hold the reins of government by reason\nof mere superiority of numbers. Before they can take on larger political\nresponsibilities they must demonstrate their ability to meet them.\n\nThe Negroes will never be allowed to control State governments so long\nas they vote at every election upon the basis of color, without regard\nwhatever to political issues or private convictions. If the Negroes\nwould divide their votes according to their individual opinions, as the\nlamented Charles Price, one of their best leaders, advised, there would\nbe no danger of Negro domination and no objection to their holding\noffices which they might be competent to fill. But as there is no\npresent prospect of their voting upon any other basis than that of\ncolor, the white people are forced to accept the situation and protect\nthemselves accordingly. Years of bitter and costly experience have\ndemonstrated over and over again that Negro rule is not only incompetent\nand corrupt, but a menace to civilization. Some people imagine that\nthere is something anomalous, peculiar, or local in the race\nprejudice that binds all Negroes together; but this clan spirit is a\ncharacteristic of all savage and semi-civilized peoples.\n\nIt should be well understood by this time that no foreign race\ninhabiting this country and acting together politically can dominate the\nnative whites. To permit an inferior race, holding less than one tenth\nof the property of the community, to take the reins of government in\nits hands, by reason of mere numerical strength, would be to renounce\ncivilization. Our national government, in making laws for Hawaii, has\ncarefully provided for white supremacy by an educational qualification\nfor suffrage that excludes the semi-civilized natives. No sane man, let\nus hope, would think of placing Manila under the control of a government\nof the Philippine Islands based upon universal suffrage. Yet the problem\nin the South and the problem in the Philippines and in Hawaii differ\nonly in degree.\n\nThe only proper safeguard against Negro rule in States where the blacks\noutnumber or approximate in number the whites lies in constitutional\nprovisions establishing an educational test for suffrage applicable\nto black and white alike. If the suffrage is not thus limited it is\nnecessary for the whites to resort to technicalities and ballot laws,\nto bribery or intimidation. To set up an educational test with a\n\"grandfather clause,\" making the test apply for a certain time to the\nblacks only, seems to an outsider unnecessary, arbitrary, and\nunjust. The reason for such a clause arises from the belief that\nno constitutional amendment could ever carry if it immediately\ndisfranchised the illiterate whites, as many property-holding whites\nbelong to that class. But the writer does not believe in the principle\nnor in the necessity for a \"grandfather clause.\" If constitutional\namendments were to be submitted in North Carolina and Virginia applying\nthe educational test to both races alike after 1908, the question would\nbe lifted above the level of party gain, and would receive the support\nof white men of all parties and the approbation of the moral sentiment\nof the American people. A white man who would disfranchise a Negro\nbecause of his color or for mere party advantage is himself unworthy of\nthe suffrage. With the suffrage question adjusted upon an educational\nbasis the Negroes would have the power to work out their political\nemancipation, the white people having made education necessary and\nprovided the means for attaining it.\n\nWhen the question of Negro domination is settled the path of progress of\nboth races will be very much cleared. Race conflicts will then be less\nfrequent and race feeling less bitter. With more friendly relations\ngrowing up, and with more concentration of energy on the part of the\nNegroes in industrial lines, the opportunities for them will be widened\nand the task of finding industrial adjustment in the struggle for life\nmade easier. The wisest and best leaders among the Negroes, such as\nBooker Washington and the late Charles Price, have tried to turn the\nattention of the Negroes from politics to the more profitable pursuits\nof industry, and if the professional politician would cease inspiring\nthe Negroes to seek salvation in political domination over the whites,\nthe race issue would soon cease to exist.\n\nThe field is broad enough in the South for both races to attain all that\nis possible to them. In spite of the periodic political conflicts and\noccasional local riots and acts of individual violence, the relations\nbetween the races, in respect to nine tenths of the population, are very\nfriendly. The general condition has been too often judged by the acts of\na small minority. The Southern people understand the Negroes, and feel\na real fondness for those that are thrifty and well behaved. When fairly\ntreated the Negro has a strong affection for his employer. He seldom\nforgets a kindness, and is quick to forget a wrong. If he does not stay\nlong at one place, it is not that he dislikes his employer so much as\nthat he has a restless temperament and craves change. His disposition\nis full of mirth and sunshine, and not a little of the fine flavor of\nSouthern wit and humor is due to his influence. His nature is plastic,\nand while he is easily molded into a monster, he is also capable of\na high degree of culture. Many Negroes are thoroughly honest,\nnotwithstanding their bad environment and hereditary disposition to\nsteal. Negro servants are trusted with the keys to households to an\nextent that, probably, is not the case among domestics elsewhere in the\ncivilized world.\n\nIt is strange that two races working side by side should possess so\nmany opposite traits of character. The white man has strong will and\nconvictions and is set in his ways. He lives an indoor, monotonous life,\nrestrains himself like a Puritan, and is inclined to melancholy. The\nprevalence of Populism throughout the South is nothing but the outcome\nof this morbid tendency. Farmers and merchants are entirely absorbed in\ntheir business, and the women, especially the married women, contrast\nwith the women of France, Germany, and even England, in their indoor\nlife and disinclination to mingle with the world outside. Public\nparks and public concerts, such as are found in Europe, which call out\nhusband, wife, and children for a few hours of rest and communion with\ntheir friends, are almost unknown in the South. The few entertainments\nthat receive sanction generally exclude all but the well-to-do by the\ncost of admission. The life of the poor in town and country is bleak and\nbare to the last degree.\n\nContrasting with this tendency is the free-and-easy life of the blacks.\nThe burdens of the present and the future weigh lightly upon their\nshoulders. They love all the worldly amusements; in their homes they are\nfree entertainers, and in their fondness for conversation and love of\nstreet life they are equal to the French or Italians.\n\nMay we not hope that the conflict of these two opposite races is working\nout some advantages to both, and that the final result will justify all\nthat the conflict has cost?\n\n\n\n\nSIGNS OF PROGRESS AMONG THE NEGROES by Booker T. Washington\n\n\nIn addition to the problem of educating eight million negroes in our\nSouthern States and ingrafting them into American citizenship, we now\nhave the additional responsibility, either directly or indirectly, of\neducating and elevating about eight hundred thousand others of African\ndescent in Cuba and Porto Rico, to say nothing of the white people of\nthese islands, many of whom are in a condition about as deplorable as\nthat of the negroes. We have, however, one advantage in approaching the\nquestion of the education of our new neighbors.\n\nThe experience that we have passed through in the Southern States during\nthe last thirty years in the education of my race, whose history and\nneeds are not very different from the history and needs of the Cubans\nand Porto Ricans, will prove most valuable in elevating the blacks of\nthe West Indian Islands. To tell what has already been accomplished in\nthe South under most difficult circumstances is to tell what may be done\nin Cuba and Porto Rico.\n\nTo this end let me tell a story.\n\nIn what is known as the black belt of the South--that is, where the\nnegroes outnumber the whites--there lived before the Civil War a white\nman who owned some two hundred slaves, and was prosperous. At the close\nof the war he found his fortune gone, except that which was represented\nin land, of which he owned several thousand acres. Of the two hundred\nslaves a large proportion decided, after their freedom, to continue on\nthe plantation of their former owner.\n\nSome years after the war a young black boy, who seemed to have \"rained\ndown,\" was discovered on the plantation by Mr. S-----, the owner. In\ndaily rides through the plantation Mr. S----- saw this boy sitting by\nthe roadside, and his condition awakened his pity, for, from want of\ncare, he was covered from head to foot with sores, and Mr. S----- soon\ngrew into the habit of tossing him a nickel or a dime as he rode by. In\nsome way this boy heard of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute\nin Alabama, and of the advantages which it offered poor but deserving\ncolored men and women to secure an education through their own labor\nwhile taking the course of study. This boy, whose name was William, made\nknown to the plantation hands his wish to go to the Tuskegee school. By\neach one \"chipping in,\" and through the efforts of the boy himself, a\nfew decent pieces of clothing were secured, and a little money, but\nnot enough to pay his railroad fare, so the boy resolved to walk to\nTuskegee, a distance of about one hundred and fifty miles. Strange to\nsay, he made the long distance with an expenditure of only twenty cents\nin cash. He frankly told every one with whom he came in contact where he\nwas going and what he was seeking. Both white and colored people along\nthe route gave him food and a place to sleep free of cost, and even\nthe usually exacting ferrymen were so impressed with the young negro's\ndesire for an education that, except in one case, he was given free\nferriage across the creeks and rivers.\n\nOne can easily imagine his appearance when he first arrived at Tuskegee,\nwith his blistered feet and small white bundle, which contained all the\nclothing he possessed.\n\nOn being shown into my office his first words were: \"I's come. S'pose\nyou been lookin' for me, but I didn't come on de railroad.\" Looking up\nthe records, it was found that this young man had been given permission\nto come several months ago, but the correspondence had long since been\nforgotten.\n\nAfter being sent to the bath-room and provided with a tooth-brush,--for\nthe tooth-brush at Tuskegee is the emblem of civilization,--William was\nassigned to a room, and was given work on the school farm of fourteen\nhundred acres, seven hundred of which are cultivated by student labor.\nDuring his first year at Tuskegee William worked on the farm during\nthe day, where he soon learned to take a deep interest in all that\nthe school was doing to teach the students the best and most improved\nmethods of farming, and studied for two hours at night in the class-room\nafter his hard day's work was over. At first he seemed drowsy and dull\nin the night-school, and would now and then fall asleep while trying to\nstudy; but he did not grow discouraged. The new machinery that he was\ncompelled to use on the farm interested him because it taught him that\nthe farm work could be stripped of much of the old-time drudgery and\ntoil, and seemed to awaken his sleeping intellect. Soon he began asking\nthe farm-instructors such questions as where the Jersey and Holstein\ncattle came from, and why they produced more milk and butter than the\ncommon long-tailed and long-horned cows that he had seen at home.\n\nHis night-school teachers found that he ceased to sleep in school, and\nbegan asking questions about his lessons, and was soon able to calculate\nthe number of square yards in an acre and to tell the number of\npeach-trees required to plant an acre of land. After he had been at\nTuskegee two or three months the farm-manager came into my office on\na cold, rainy day, and said that William was virtually barefooted, the\nsoles of his shoes having separated from the uppers, though William\nhad fastened them together as best he could with bits of wire. In\nthis condition the farm-instructor found him plowing without a word of\ncomplaint. A pair of second-hand shoes was secured for him, and he was\nsoon very happy.\n\nI will not take this part of the story further except to say that at the\nend of his first year at Tuskegee this young man, having made a start in\nhis books, and having saved a small sum of money above the cost of his\nboard, which was credited to his account, entered the next year\nour regular day-classes, though still dividing his time between the\nclass-room and work on the farm.\n\nToward the end of the year he found himself in need of money with which\nto buy books, clothing, etc., and so wrote a carefully worded letter to\nMr. S-----, the white man on whose plantation he had lived, and who had\nbeen, in slavery, the owner of his mother.\n\nIn the letter he told Mr. S----- how he got to Tuskegee, what he was\ndoing, and what his needs were, and asked Mr. S----- to lend him fifteen\ndollars. Before receiving this letter Mr. S----- had not thought once\nabout the boy during his two years' absence; in fact, did not know that\nhe had left the plantation.\n\nMr. S----- was a good deal shocked, as well as amused, over such a\nrequest from such a source. The letter went to the wastebasket without\nbeing answered. A few weeks later William sent a second letter, in which\nhe took it for granted that the first letter had not been received. The\nsecond letter shared the same fate as the first. A third letter reached\nMr. S----- in a few weeks, making the same request. In answer to the\nthird letter Mr. S----- told me that, moved by some impulse which he\nhimself never understood, he sent William the fifteen dollars.\n\nTwo or three years passed, and Mr. S----- had about forgotten William\nand the fifteen dollars; but one morning while sitting upon his porch\na bright young colored man walked up and introduced himself as William,\nthe boy to whom he used to toss small pieces of money, and the one to\nwhom he had sent fifteen dollars.\n\nWilliam paid Mr. S----- the fifteen dollars with interest, which he had\nearned while teaching school after leaving Tuskegee.\n\nThis simple experience with this young colored man made a new and\ndifferent person of Mr. S-----, so far as the negro was concerned.\n\nHe began to think. He thought of the long past, but he thought most of\nthe future, and of his duty toward the hundreds of colored people on his\nplantation and in his community. After careful thought he asked William\nEdwards to open a school on his plantation in a vacant log cabin.\nThat was seven years ago. On this same plantation at Snow Hill, Wilcox\ncounty, Alabama, a county where, according to the last census, there are\ntwenty-four thousand colored people and about six thousand whites, there\nis now a school with two hundred pupils, five teachers from Tuskegee,\nand three school buildings. The school has forty acres of land. In\naddition to the text-book lessons, the boys are taught farming and\ncarpentry, and the girls sewing and general house-keeping, and the\nschool is now in the act of starting a blacksmith and wheelwright\ndepartment. This school owes its existence almost wholly to Mr. S-----,\nwho gave to the trustees the forty acres of land, and has contributed\nliberally to the building fund, as well as to the pay of the teachers.\nGifts from a few friends in the North have been received, and the\ncolored people have given their labor and small sums in cash. When the\npeople cannot find money to give, they have often given corn, chickens,\nand eggs. The school has grown so popular that almost every leading\nwhite man in the community is willing to make a small gift toward its\nmaintenance.\n\nIn addition to the work done directly in the school for the children,\nthe teachers in the Snow Hill school have organized a kind of university\nextension movement. The farmers are organized into conferences, which\nhold meetings each month. In these meetings they are taught better\nmethods of agriculture, how to buy land, how to economize and keep\nout of debt, how to stop mortgaging, how to build school-houses and\ndwelling-houses with more than one room, how to bring about a higher\nmoral and religious standing, and are warned against buying cheap\njewelry, snuff, and whisky.\n\nNo one is a more interested visitor at these meetings than Mr.\nS-----himself. The matter does not end in mere talk and advice. The\nwomen teachers go right into the cabins of the people and show them how\nto keep them clean, how to dust, sweep, and cook.\n\nWhen William Edwards left this community a few years ago for the\nTuskegee school, he left the larger proportion in debt, mortgaging their\ncrops every year for the food on which to live. Most of them were living\non rented land in small one-room log cabins, and attempting to pay an\nenormous rate of interest on the value of their food advances. As one\nold colored man expressed it, \"I ain't got but six feet of land, and I\nis got to die to git dat.\" The little school taught in a cabin lasted\nonly three or four months in the year. The religion was largely a matter\nof the emotions, with almost no practical ideas of morality. It was the\nwhite man for himself and the negro for himself, each in too many cases\ntrying to take advantage of the other. The situation was pretty well\ndescribed by a black man who said to me: \"I tells you how we votes.\nWe always watches de white man, and we keeps watchin' de white man.\nDe nearer it gits to 'lection-time de more we watches de white man. We\nkeeps watchin' de white man till we find out which way he gwine to vote;\nden we votes 'zactly de odder way. Den we knows we is right.\"\n\nNow how changed is all at Snow Hill, and how it is gradually changing\neach year! Instead of the hopelessness and dejection that were there a\nfew years ago, there are now light and buoyancy in the countenances and\nmovements of the people. The negroes are getting out of debt and buying\nland, ceasing to mortgage their crops, building houses with two or three\nrooms, and a higher moral and religious standard has been established.\n\nLast May, on the day that the school had its closing exercises, there\nwere present, besides the hundreds of colored-people, about fifty of the\nleading white men and women of the county, and these white people seemed\nas much interested in the work of the school as the people of my own\nrace.\n\nOnly a few years ago in the State of Alabama the law in reference to the\neducation of the negro read as follows: \"Any person or persons who shall\nattempt to teach any free person of color or slave to spell, read, or\nwrite shall, upon conviction thereof by indictment, be fined in a sum\nnot less than two hundred and fifty dollars nor more than five hundred\ndollars.\"\n\nWithin half a dozen years I have heard Dr. J. L. M. Curry, a brave,\nhonest ex-Confederate officer, in addressing both the Alabama and\nGeorgia State legislatures, say to those bodies in the most emphatic\nmanner that it was as much the duty of the State to educate the negro\nchildren as the white children, and in each case Dr. Curry's words were\ncheered.\n\nHere at Snow Hill is the foundation for the solution of the legal and\npolitical difficulties that exist in the South, and the improvement\nof the industrial condition of the negro in Cuba and Porto Rico. This\nsolution will not come all at once, but gradually. The foundation must\nexist in the commercial and industrial development of the people of my\nrace in the South and in the West Indian Islands.\n\nThe most intelligent whites are beginning to realize that they cannot go\nmuch higher than they lift the negro at the same time. When a black man\nowns and cultivates the best farm to be found in his county he will have\nthe confidence and respect of most of the white people in that county.\nWhen a black man is the largest taxpayer in his community his white\nneighbor will not object very long to his voting, and having that vote\nhonestly counted. Even now a black man who has five hundred dollars to\nlend has no trouble in finding a white man who is willing to borrow his\nmoney. The negro who is a large stockholder in a railroad company will\nalways be treated with justice on that railroad.\n\nMany of the most intelligent colored people are learning that while\nthere are many bad white men in the South, there are Southern whites who\nhave the highest interests of the negro just as closely at heart as have\nany other people in any part of the country. Many of the negroes are\nlearning that it is folly not to cultivate in every honorable way the\nfriendship of the white man who is their next-door neighbor.\n\nTo describe the work being done in connection with the public schools\nby graduates of Tuskegee and other institutions in the South, at\nsuch places as Mount Meigs, under Miss Cornelia Bowen; Denmark, South\nCarolina; Abbeville and Newville, Alabama; Christiansburg, Virginia, and\nnumbers of other places in the Gulf States, would be only to repeat in a\nlarger or smaller degree what I have said of Snow Hill.\n\nNot very long after the last national election I visited a town in the\nSouth, to speak at a meeting which had for its object the raising of\nmoney to complete the school-house. The audience was about equally\ndivided between white men and women and black men and women. When the\ntime for the collection came it was intensely satisfactory to observe\nthat the white side of the audience was just as eager to make its small\ncontributions as were the members of my own race. But I was anxious to\nsee how the late election had been conducted in that community. I soon\nfound out that the Republican party, composed almost wholly of the black\npeople, was represented by an election officer in the person of one of\nthe best-educated colored men in the town, that both the Democratic and\nPopulist parties were equally well represented, and that there was no\nsuspicion of unfairness.\n\nBut I wished to go a little deeper, and I soon found that one of the\nleading stores in this community was owned by a colored man; that a\ncotton-gin was owned by a colored man; that the sawmill was owned by\nanother colored man. Colored men had mortgages on white men's crops, and\nvice versa, and colored people not only owned land, but in several cases\nwere renting land to white men. Black men were in debt to white men,\nand white men were in debt to black men. In a word, the industrial and\ncommercial relations of the races were interwoven just as if all had\nbeen of one race.\n\nAn object-lesson in civilization is more potent in compelling people to\nact right than a law compelling them to do so. Some years ago a colored\nwoman who had graduated at Tuskegee began her life-work in a Southern\ncommunity where the force of white public sentiment was opposed to the\nstarting of what was termed a \"nigger school.\" At first this girl was\ntempted to abuse her white sister, but she remembered that perhaps the\nwhite woman had been taught from her earliest childhood, through reading\nand conversation, that education was not good for the negro, that it\nwould result only in trouble to the community, and that no amount of\nabuse could change this prejudice.\n\nAfter a while this colored teacher was married to an educated colored\nman, and they built a little cottage, which, in connection with her\nhusband's farm, was a model. One morning one of the white women who\nhad been most intense in her feelings was passing this cottage, and\nher attention was attracted to the colored woman who was at work in\nher beautiful flower-garden. A conversation took place concerning the\nflowers. At another time this same white woman was so attracted by this\nflower-garden that she came inside the yard, and from the yard she went\ninto the sitting-room and examined the books and papers.\n\nThis acquaintance has now ripened and broadened, so that to-day there\nare few people in that community more highly respected than this colored\nfamily. What did it all? This object-lesson. No one could explain that\naway. One such object-lesson in every community in the South is more\npowerful than all the laws Congress can pass in the direction of\nbringing about right relations between blacks and whites.\n\nA few months ago an agricultural county fair, the first ever held in\nthat county, was organized and held at Calhoun, Alabama, by the teachers\nin the Calhoun School, which is an offshoot of the Hampton Institute.\nBoth the colored people and numbers of white visitors were astonished at\nthe creditable exhibits made by the colored people. Most of these white\npeople saw the school work at Calhoun for the first time. Perhaps\nno amount of abstract talk or advice could have brought them to this\nschool, but the best hog, the largest pumpkin, or the most valuable bale\nof cotton possessed a common interest, and it has been a comparatively\neasy thing to extend their interest from the best hog to the work\nbeing done in the school-room. Further, this fair convinced these white\npeople, as almost nothing else could have done, that education was\nmaking the negroes better citizens rather than worse; that the people\nwere not being educated away from themselves, but with their elevation\nthe conditions about them were being lifted in a manner that possessed\nan interest and value for both races.\n\nIt was after speaking, not long ago, to the colored people at such a\ncounty fair in North Carolina that I was asked the next morning to speak\nto the white students at their college, who gave me as hearty a greeting\nas I have ever received at Northern colleges.\n\nBut such forces as I have described--forces that are gradually\nregenerating the entire South and will regenerate Cuba and Porto\nRico--are not started and kept in motion without a central plant--a\npower-house, where the power is generated. I cannot describe all these\nplaces of power. Perhaps the whole South and the whole country are\nmost indebted to the Hampton Institute in Virginia. Then there is Fisk\nUniversity at Nashville, Tennessee; Talladega College at Talladega,\nAlabama; Spelman Seminary, Atlanta University, and Atlanta Baptist\nCollege at Atlanta; Biddle University in North Carolina; Claflin\nUniversity at Orangeburg, South Carolina; and Knoxville College at\nKnoxville, Tennessee. Some of these do a different grade of work, but\none much needed.\n\nAt Tuskegee, Alabama, starting fifteen years ago in a little shanty with\none teacher and thirty students, with no property, there has grown up an\nindustrial and educational village where the ideas that I have referred\nto are put into the heads, hearts, and hands of an army of colored men\nand women, with the purpose of having them become centers of light\nand civilization in every part of the South. One visiting the Tuskegee\nNormal and Industrial Institute to-day will find eight hundred and fifty\nstudents gathered from twenty-four States, with eighty-eight teachers\nand officers training these students in literary, religious, and\nindustrial work.\n\nCounting the students and the families of the instructors, the visitor\nwill find a black village of about twelve hundred people. Instead of the\nold, worn-out plantation that was there fifteen years ago, there is a\nmodern farm of seven hundred acres cultivated by student labor. There\nare Jersey and Holstein cows and Berkshire pigs, and the butter used is\nmade by the most modern process.\n\nAside from the dozens of neat, comfortable cottages owned by individual\nteachers and other persons, who have settled in this village for the\npurpose of educating their children, he will find thirty-six buildings\nof various kinds and sizes, owned and built by the school, property\nvalued at three hundred thousand dollars. Perhaps the most interesting\nthing in connection with these buildings is that, with the exception of\nthree, they have been built by student labor. The friends of the school\nhave furnished money to pay the teachers and for material.\n\nWhen a building is to be erected, the teacher in charge of the\nmechanical and architectural drawing department gives to the class in\ndrawing a general description of the building desired, and then there is\na competition to see whose plan will be accepted. These same students in\nmost cases help do the practical work of putting up the building--some\nat the sawmill, the brick-yard, or in the carpentry, brickmaking,\nplastering, painting, and tinsmithing departments. At the same time care\nis taken to see not only that the building goes up properly, but that\nthe students, who are under intelligent instructors in their special\nbranch, are taught at the same time the principles as well as the\npractical part of the trade.\n\nThe school has the building in the end, and the students have the\nknowledge of the trade. This same principle applies, whether in the\nlaundry, where the washing for seven or eight hundred people is done, or\nin the sewing-room, where a large part of the clothing for this colony\nis made and repaired, or in the wheelwright and blacksmith departments,\nwhere all the wagons and buggies used by the school, besides a\nlarge number for the outside public, are manufactured, or in the\nprinting-office, where a large part of the printing for the white and\ncolored people in this region is done. Twenty-six different industries\nare here in constant operation.\n\nWhen the student is through with his course of training he goes out\nfeeling that it is just as honorable to labor with the hand as with the\nhead, and instead of his having to look for a place, the place usually\nseeks him, because he has to give that which the South wants. One other\nthing should not be overlooked in our efforts to develop the black man.\nAs bad as slavery was, almost every large plantation in the South during\nthat time was, in a measure, an industrial school. It had its farming\ndepartment, its blacksmith, wheelwright, brickmaking, carpentry, and\nsewing departments. Thus at the close of the war our people were in\npossession of all the common and skilled labor in the South. For nearly\ntwenty years after the war we overlooked the value of the ante-bellum\ntraining, and no one was trained to replace these skilled men and women\nwho were soon to pass away; and now, as skilled laborers from foreign\ncountries, with not only educated hands but trained brains, begin to\ncome into the South and take these positions once held by us, we are\ngradually waking up to the fact that we must compete with the white man\nin the industrial world if we would hold our own. No one understands his\nvalue in the labor world better than the old colored man. Recently, when\na convention was held in the South by the white people for the purpose\nof inducing white settlers from the North and West to settle in the\nSouth, one of these colored men said to the president of the convention:\n\"'Fore de Lord, boss, we's got as many white people down here now as we\nniggers can support.\"\n\nThe negro in the South has another advantage. While there is prejudice\nagainst him along certain lines,--in the matter of business in general,\nand the trades especially,--there is virtually no prejudice so far as\nthe native Southern white man is concerned. White men and black men work\nat the same carpenter's bench and on the same brick wall. Sometimes the\nwhite man is the \"boss,\" sometimes the black man is the boss.\n\nSome one chaffed a colored man recently because, when he got through\nwith a contract for building a house, he cleared just ten cents; but\nhe said: \"All right, boss; it was worth ten cents to be de boss of\ndem white men.\" If a Southern white man has a contract to let for the\nbuilding of a house, he prefers the black contractor, because he has\nbeen used to doing business of this character with a negro rather than\nwith a white man.\n\nThe negro will find his way up as a man just in proportion as he makes\nhimself valuable, possesses something that a white man wants, can do\nsomething as well as, or better than, a white man.\n\nI would not have my readers get the thought that the problem in the\nSouth is settled, that there is nothing else to be done; far from this.\nLong years of patient, hard work will be required for the betterment of\nthe condition of the negro in the South, as well as for the betterment\nof the condition of the negro in the West Indies.\n\nThere are bright spots here and there that point the way. Perhaps the\nmost that we have accomplished in the last thirty years is to show the\nNorth and the South how the fourteen slaves landed a few hundred years\nago at Jamestown, Virginia,--now nearly eight millions of freemen in the\nSouth alone,--are to be made a safe and useful part of our democratic\nand Christian institutions.\n\nThe main thing that is now needed to bring about a solution of the\ndifficulties in the South is money in large sums, to be used largely for\nChristian, technical, and industrial education.\n\nFor more than thirty years we have been trying to solve one of the most\nserious problems in the history of the world largely by passing around\na hat in the North. Out of their poverty the Southern States have done\nwell in assisting; many more millions are needed, and these millions\nwill have to come before the question as to the negro in the South is\nsettled.\n\nThere never was a greater opportunity for men of wealth to place a few\nmillion dollars where they could be used in lifting up and regenerating\na whole race; and let it always be borne in mind that every dollar given\nfor the proper education of the negro in the South is almost as much\nhelp to the Southern white man as to the negro himself. So long as\nthe whites in the South are surrounded by a race that is, in a large\nmeasure, in ignorance and poverty, so long will this ignorance and\npoverty of the negro in a score of ways prevent the highest development\nof the white man.\n\nThe problem of lifting up the negro in Cuba and Porto Rico is an easier\none in one respect, even if it proves more difficult in others. It will\nbe less difficult, because there is the absence of that higher degree of\nrace feeling which exists in many parts of the United States. Both the\nwhite Cuban and the white Spaniard have treated the people of African\ndescent, in civil, political, military, and business matters, very much\nas they have treated others of their own race. Oppression has not cowed\nand unmanned the Cuban negro in certain respects as it has the American\nnegro.\n\nIn only a few instances is the color-line drawn. How Americans will\ntreat the negro Cuban, and what will be the tendency of American\ninfluences in the matter of the relation of the races, remains an\ninteresting and open question. Certainly it will place this country in\nan awkward position to have gone to war to free a people from Spanish\ncruelty, and then as soon as it gets them within its power to treat a\nlarge proportion of the population worse than did even Spain herself,\nsimply on account of color.\n\nWhile in the matter of the relation of the races the problem before us\nin the West Indies is easier, in respect to the industrial, moral, and\nreligious sides it is more difficult. The negroes on these islands are\nlargely an agricultural people, and for this reason, in addition to\na higher degree of mental and religious training, they need the same\nagricultural, mechanical, and domestic training that is fast helping the\nnegroes in our Southern States. Industrial training will not only help\nthem to the ownership of property, habits of thrift and economy, but the\nacquiring of these elements of strength will go further than anything\nelse in improving the moral and religious condition of the masses, just\nas has been and is true of my people in the Southern States.\n\nWith the idea of getting the methods of industrial education pursued at\nHampton and Tuskegee permanently and rightly started in Cuba and Porto\nRico, a few of the most promising men and women from these islands\nhave been brought to the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute,\nand educated with the view of having them return and take the lead in\naffording industrial training on these islands, where the training can\nbest be given to the masses.\n\nThe emphasis that I have placed upon an industrial education does not\nmean that the negro is to be excluded from the higher interests of\nlife, but it does mean that in proportion as the negro gets the\nfoundation,--the useful before the ornamental,--in the same proportion\nwill he accelerate his progress in acquiring those elements which do not\npertain so directly to the utilitarian.\n\nPhillips Brooks once said, \"One generation gathers the material, and\nthe next builds the palaces.\" Very largely this must be the\nmaterial-gathering generation of black people, but in due time the\npalaces will come if we are patient.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MARCH OF PROGRESS by Charles W. Chesnutt\n\n\nThe colored people of Patesville had at length gained the object they\nhad for a long time been seeking--the appointment of a committee of\nthemselves to manage the colored schools of the town. They had argued,\nwith some show of reason, that they were most interested in the\neducation of their own children, and in a position to know, better than\nany committee of white men could, what was best for their children's\nneeds. The appointments had been made by the county commissioners during\nthe latter part of the summer, and a week later a meeting was called for\nthe purpose of electing a teacher to take charge of the grammar school\nat the beginning of the fall term.\n\nThe committee consisted of Frank Gillespie, or \"Glaspy,\" a barber, who\ntook an active part in local politics; Bob Cotten, a blacksmith, who\nowned several houses and was looked upon as a substantial citizen; and\nAbe Johnson, commonly called \"Ole Abe\" or \"Uncle Abe,\" who had a large\nfamily, and drove a dray, and did odd jobs of hauling; he was also a\nclass-leader in the Methodist church. The committee had been chosen\nfrom among a number of candidates--Gillespie on account of his political\nstanding, Cotten as representing the solid element of the colored\npopulation, and Old Abe, with democratic impartiality, as likely to\nsatisfy the humbler class of a humble people. While the choice had not\npleased everybody,--for instance, some of the other applicants,--it was\nacquiesced in with general satisfaction. The first meeting of the new\ncommittee was of great public interest, partly by reason of its novelty,\nbut chiefly because there were two candidates for the position of\nteacher of the grammar school.\n\nThe former teacher, Miss Henrietta Noble, had applied for the school.\nShe had taught the colored children of Patesville for fifteen years.\nWhen the Freedmen's Bureau, after the military occupation of North\nCarolina, had called for volunteers to teach the children of the\nfreedmen, Henrietta Nobel had offered her services. Brought up in a New\nEngland household by parents who taught her to fear God and love her\nfellow-men, she had seen her father's body brought home from a Southern\nbattle-field and laid to rest in the village cemetery; and a short six\nmonths later she had buried her mother by his side. Henrietta had no\nbrothers or sisters, and her nearest relatives were cousins living in\nthe far West. The only human being in whom she felt any special personal\ninterest was a certain captain in her father's regiment, who had paid\nher some attention. She had loved this man deeply, in a maidenly, modest\nway; but he had gone away without speaking, and had not since written.\nHe had escaped the fate of many others, and at the close of the war was\nalive and well, stationed in some Southern garrison.\n\nWhen her mother died, Henrietta had found herself possessed only of the\nhouse where she lived and the furniture it contained, neither being of\nmuch value, and she was thrown upon her own resources for a livelihood.\nShe had a fair education and had read many good books. It was not\neasy to find employment such as she desired. She wrote to her Western\ncousins, and they advised her to come to them, as they thought they\ncould do something for her if she were there. She had almost decided\nto accept their offer, when the demand arose for teachers in the South.\nWhether impelled by some strain of adventurous blood from a Pilgrim\nancestry, or by a sensitive pride that shrank from dependence, or by\nsome dim and unacknowledged hope that she might sometime, somewhere,\nsomehow meet Captain Carey--whether from one of these motives or a\ncombination of them all, joined to something of the missionary spirit,\nshe decided to go South, and wrote to her cousins declining their\nfriendly offer.\n\nShe had come to Patesville when the children were mostly a mob of dirty\nlittle beggars. She had distributed among them the cast-off clothing\nthat came from their friends in the North; she had taught them to wash\ntheir faces and to comb their hair; and patiently, year after year, she\nhad labored to instruct them in the rudiments of learning and the first\nprinciples of religion and morality. And she had not wrought in vain.\nOther agencies, it is true, had in time cooperated with her efforts, but\nany one who had watched the current of events must have been compelled\nto admit that the very fair progress of the colored people of Patesville\nin the fifteen years following emancipation had been due chiefly to the\nunselfish labors of Henrietta Noble, and that her nature did not belie\nher name.\n\nFifteen years is a long time. Miss Noble had never met Captain Carey;\nand when she learned later that he had married a Southern girl in the\nneighborhood of his post, she had shed her tears in secret and banished\nhis image from her heart. She had lived a lonely life. The white people\nof the town, though they learned in time to respect her and to value her\nwork, had never recognized her existence by more than the mere external\ncourtesy shown by any community to one who lives in the midst of it. The\nsituation was at first, of course, so strained that she did not expect\nsympathy from the white people; and later, when time had smoothed over\nsome of the asperities of war, her work had so engaged her that she had\nnot had time to pine over her social exclusion. Once or twice nature had\nasserted itself, and she had longed for her own kind, and had visited\nher New England home. But her circle of friends was broken up, and she\ndid not find much pleasure in boarding-house life; and on her last visit\nto the North but one, she had felt so lonely that she had longed for the\ndark faces of her pupils, and had welcomed with pleasure the hour when\nher task should be resumed.\n\nBut for several reasons the school at Patesville was of more importance\nto Miss Noble at this particular time than it ever had been before.\nDuring the last few years her health had not been good. An affection\nof the heart similar to that from which her mother had died, while not\ninterfering perceptibly with her work, had grown from bad to worse,\naggravated by close application to her duties, until it had caused her\ngrave alarm. She did not have perfect confidence in the skill of the\nPatesville physicians, and to obtain the best medical advice had gone to\nNew York during the summer, remaining there a month under the treatment\nof an eminent specialist. This, of course, had been expensive and had\nabsorbed the savings of years from a small salary; and when the time\ncame for her to return to Patesville, she was reduced, after paying her\ntraveling expenses, to her last ten-dollar note.\n\n\"It is very fortunate,\" the great man had said at her last visit, \"that\ncircumstances permit you to live in the South, for I am afraid you could\nnot endure a Northern winter. You are getting along very well now, and\nif you will take care of yourself and avoid excitement, you will be\nbetter.\" He said to himself as she went away: \"It's only a matter of\ntime, but that is true about us all; and a wise physician does as much\ngood by what he withholds as by what he tells.\"\n\nMiss Noble had not anticipated any trouble about the school. When\nshe went away the same committee of white men was in charge that had\ncontrolled the school since it had become part of the public-school\nsystem of the State on the withdrawal of support from the Freedmen's\nBureau. While there had been no formal engagement made for the next\nyear, when she had last seen the chairman before she went away, he had\nremarked that she was looking rather fagged out, had bidden her good-by,\nand had hoped to see her much improved when she returned. She had left\nher house in the care of the colored woman who lived with her and did\nher housework, assuming, of course, that she would take up her work\nagain in the autumn.\n\nShe was much surprised at first, and later alarmed, to find a rival for\nher position as teacher of the grammar school. Many of her friends and\npupils had called on her since her return, and she had met a number\nof the people at the colored Methodist church, where she taught in the\nSunday-school. She had many friends and supporters, but she soon found\nout that her opponent had considerable strength. There had been a time\nwhen she would have withdrawn and left him a clear field, but at\nthe present moment it was almost a matter of life and death to\nher--certainly the matter of earning a living--to secure the\nappointment.\n\nThe other candidate was a young man who in former years had been one of\nMiss Noble's brightest pupils. When he had finished his course in the\ngrammar school, his parents, with considerable sacrifice, had sent him\nto a college for colored youth. He had studied diligently, had worked\nindustriously during his vacations, sometimes at manual labor, sometimes\nteaching a country school, and in due time had been graduated from his\ncollege with honors. He had come home at the end of his school life,\nand was very naturally seeking the employment for which he had fitted\nhimself. He was a \"bright\" mulatto, with straight hair, an intelligent\nface, and a well-set figure. He had acquired some of the marks of\nculture, wore a frock-coat and a high collar, parted his hair in the\nmiddle, and showed by his manner that he thought a good deal of himself.\nHe was the popular candidate among the progressive element of his\npeople, and rather confidently expected the appointment.\n\nThe meeting of the committee was held in the Methodist church, where,\nin fact, the grammar school was taught, for want of a separate\nschool-house. After the preliminary steps to effect an organization, Mr.\nGillespie, who had been elected chairman, took the floor.\n\n\"The principal business to be brought befo' the meet'n' this evenin',\"\nhe said, \"is the selection of a teacher for our grammar school for the\nensuin' year. Two candidates have filed applications, which, if there\nis no objection, I will read to the committee. The first is from Miss\nNoble, who has been the teacher ever since the grammar school was\nstarted.\"\n\nHe then read Miss Noble's letter, in which she called attention to her\nlong years of service, to her need of the position, and to her affection\nfor the pupils, and made formal application for the school for the\nnext year. She did not, from motives of self-respect, make known the\nextremity of her need; nor did she mention the condition of her health,\nas it might have been used as an argument against her retention.\n\nMr. Gillespie then read the application of the other candidate, Andrew\nJ. Williams. Mr. Williams set out in detail his qualifications for the\nposition: his degree from Riddle University; his familiarity with the\ndead and living languages and the higher mathematics; his views of\ndiscipline; and a peroration in which he expressed the desire to devote\nhimself to the elevation of his race and assist the march of progress\nthrough the medium of the Patesville grammar school. The letter was well\nwritten in a bold, round hand, with many flourishes, and looked very\naggressive and overbearing as it lay on the table by the side of the\nsheet of small note-paper in Miss Noble's faint and somewhat cramped\nhandwriting.\n\n\"You have heard the readin' of the applications,\" said the chairman.\n\"Gentlemen, what is yo' pleasure?\"\n\nThere being no immediate response, the chairman continued:\n\n\"As this is a matter of consid'able importance, involvin' not only the\nwelfare of our schools, but the progress of our race, an' as our action\nis liable to be criticized, whatever we decide, perhaps we had better\ndiscuss the subjec' befo' we act. If nobody else has anything to\nobse've, I will make a few remarks.\"\n\nMr. Gillespie cleared his throat, and, assuming an oratorical attitude,\nproceeded:\n\n\"The time has come in the history of our people when we should stand\ntogether. In this age of organization the march of progress requires\nthat we help ourselves, or be forever left behind. Ever since the war we\nhave been sendin' our child'n to school an' educatin' 'em; an' now the\ntime has come when they are leavin' the schools an' colleges, an' are\nready to go to work. An' what are they goin' to do? The white people\nwon't hire 'em as clerks in their sto's an' factories an' mills, an' we\nhave no sto's or factories or mills of our own. They can't be lawyers\nor doctors yet, because we haven't got the money to send 'em to medical\ncolleges an' law schools. We can't elect many of 'em to office, for\nvarious reasons. There's just two things they can find to do--to preach\nin our own pulpits, an' teach in our own schools. If it wasn't for\nthat, they'd have to go on forever waitin' on white folks, like their\nfo'fathers have done, because they couldn't help it. If we expect our\nrace to progress, we must educate our young men an' women. If we want\nto encourage 'em to get education, we must find 'em employment when they\nare educated. We have now an opportunity to do this in the case of\nour young friend an' fellow-citizen, Mr. Williams, whose eloquent an'\nfine-lookin' letter ought to make us feel proud of him an' of our race.\n\n\"Of co'se there are two sides to the question. We have got to consider\nthe claims of Miss Noble. She has been with us a long time an' has\ndone much good work for our people, an' we'll never forget her work an'\nfrien'ship. But, after all, she has been paid for it; she has got\nher salary regularly an' for a long time, an' she has probably saved\nsomethin', for we all know she hasn't lived high; an', for all we know,\nshe may have had somethin' left her by her parents. An' then again,\nshe's white, an' has got her own people to look after her; they've got\nall the money an' all the offices an' all the everythin',--all that\nthey've made an' all that we've made for fo' hundred years,--an' they\nsho'ly would look out for her. If she don't get this school, there's\nprobably a dozen others she can get at the North. An' another thing: she\nis gettin' rather feeble, an' it 'pears to me she's hardly able to stand\nteachin' so many child'n, an' a long rest might be the best thing in the\nworld for her.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, that's the situation. Shall we keep Miss Noble, or\nshall we stand by our own people? It seems to me there can hardly be but\none answer. Self-preservation is the first law of nature. Are there any\nother remarks?\"\n\nOld Abe was moving restlessly in his seat. He did not say anything,\nhowever, and the chairman turned to the other member.\n\n\"Brother Cotten, what is yo' opinion of the question befo' the board?\"\n\nMr. Cotten rose with the slowness and dignity becoming a substantial\ncitizen, and observed:\n\n\"I think the remarks of the chairman have great weight. We all have\nnothin' but kind feelin's fer Miss Noble, an' I came here to-night\nsomewhat undecided how to vote on this question. But after listenin' to\nthe just an' forcible arguments of Brother Glaspy, it 'pears to me that,\nafter all, the question befo' us is not a matter of feelin', but of\nbusiness. As a business man, I am inclined to think Brother Glaspy is\nright. If we don't help ourselves when we get a chance, who is goin' to\nhelp us?\"\n\n\"That bein' the case,\" said the chairman, \"shall we proceed to a vote?\nAll who favor the election of Brother Williams--\"\n\nAt this point Old Abe, with much preliminary shuffling, stood up in his\nplace and interrupted the speaker.\n\n\"Mr. Chuhman,\" he said, \"I s'pose I has a right ter speak in dis meet'n?\nI S'POSE I is a member er dis committee?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Brother Johnson, certainly; we shall be glad to hear from\nyou.\"\n\n\"I s'pose I's got a right ter speak my min', ef I is po' an' black, an'\ndon' weah as good clo's as some other members er de committee?\"\n\n\"Most assuredly, Brother Johnson,\" answered the chairman, with a\nbarber's suavity, \"you have as much right to be heard as any one else.\nThere was no intention of cuttin' you off.\"\n\n\"I s'pose,\" continued Abe, \"dat a man wid fo'teen child'n kin be 'lowed\nter hab somethin' ter say 'bout de schools er dis town?\"\n\n\"I am sorry, Brother Johnson, that you should feel slighted, but there\nwas no intention to igno' yo' rights. The committee will be please' to\nhave you ventilate yo' views.\"\n\n\"Ef it's all be'n an' done reco'nized an' 'cided dat I's got de right\nter be heared in dis meet'n', I'll say w'at I has ter say, an' it won't\ntake me long ter say it. Ef I should try ter tell all de things dat Miss\nNoble has done fer de niggers er dis town, it'd take me till ter-morrer\nmawnin'. Fer fifteen long yeahs I has watched her incomin's an' her\noutgoin's. Her daddy was a Yankee kunnel, who died fighting fer ou'\nfreedom. She come heah when we--yas, Mr. Chuhman, when you an' Br'er\nCotten--was jes sot free, an' when none er us didn' have a rag ter ou'\nbacks. She come heah, an' she tuk yo' child'n an' my child'n, an' she\nteached 'em sense an' manners an' religion an' book-l'arnin'. When she\ncome heah we didn' hab no chu'ch. Who writ up No'th an' got a preacher\nsent to us, an' de fun's ter buil' dis same chu'ch-house we're settin'\nin ter-night? Who got de money f'm de Bureau to s'port de school? An'\nwhen dat was stop', who got de money f'm de Peabody Fun'? Talk about\nMiss Noble gittin' a sal'ry! Who paid dat sal'ry up ter five years ago?\nNot one dollah of it come outer ou' pockets!\n\n\"An' den, w'at did she git fer de yuther things she done? Who paid her\nfer de gals she kep' f'm throwin' deyse'ves away? Who paid fer de boys\nshe kep' outer jail? I had a son dat seemed to hab made up his min' ter\ngo straight ter hell. I made him go ter Sunday-school, an' somethin' dat\nwoman said teched his heart, an' he behaved hisse'f, an' I ain' got no\nreason fer ter be 'shame' er 'im. An' I can 'member, Br'er Cotten, when\nyou didn' own fo' houses an' a fahm. An' when yo' fus wife was sick, who\nsot by her bedside an' read de Good Book ter 'er, w'en dey wuzn' nobody\nelse knowed how ter read it, an' comforted her on her way across de\ncol', dahk ribber? An' dat ain' all I kin 'member, Mr. Chuhman! When yo'\ngal Fanny was a baby, an' sick, an' nobody knowed what was de matter wid\n'er, who sent fer a doctor, an' paid 'im fer comin', an' who he'ped nuss\ndat chile, an' tol' yo' wife w'at ter do, an' save' dat chile's life,\njes as sho' as de Lawd has save' my soul?\n\n\"An' now, aftuh fifteen yeahs o' slavin' fer us, who ain't got no claim\non her, aftuh fifteen yeahs dat she has libbed 'mongs' us an' made\nherse'f one of us, an' endyoed havin' her own people look down on her,\naftuh she has growed ole an' gray wukkin' fer us an' our child'n, we\ntalk erbout turnin' 'er out like a' ole hoss ter die! It 'pears ter me\nsome folks has po' mem'ries! Whar would we 'a' be'n ef her folks at de\nNo'th hadn' 'membered us no bettuh? An' we hadn' done nothin', neither,\nfer dem to 'member us fer. De man dat kin fergit w'at Miss Noble has\ndone fer dis town is unworthy de name er nigger! He oughter die an' make\nroom fer some 'spectable dog!\n\n\"Br'er Glaspy says we got a' educated young man, an' we mus' gib him\nsump'n' ter do. Let him wait; ef I reads de signs right he won't hab\nter wait long fer dis job. Let him teach in de primary schools, er in de\ncountry; an' ef he can't do dat, let 'im work awhile. It don't hahm a'\neducated man ter work a little; his fo'fathers has worked fer hund'eds\nof years, an' we's worked, an' we're heah yet, an' we're free, an' we's\ngettin' ou' own houses an' lots an' hosses an' cows--an' ou' educated\nyoung men. But don't let de fus thing we do as a committee be somethin'\nwe ought ter be 'shamed of as long as we lib. I votes fer Miss Noble,\nfus, las', an' all de time!\"\n\nWhen Old Abe sat down the chairman's face bore a troubled look. He\nremembered how his baby girl, the first of his children that he could\nreally call his own, that no master could hold a prior claim upon,\nlay dying in the arms of his distracted young wife, and how the thin,\nhomely, and short-sighted white teacher had come like an angel into his\ncabin, and had brought back the little one from the verge of the grave.\nThe child was a young woman now, and Gillespie had well-founded hopes of\nsecuring the superior young Williams for a son-in-law; and he realized\nwith something of shame that this later ambition had so dazzled his eyes\nfor a moment as to obscure the memory of earlier days.\n\nMr. Cotten, too, had not been unmoved, and there were tears in his eyes\nas he recalled how his first wife, Nancy, who had borne with him the\nprivations of slavery, had passed away, with the teacher's hand in hers,\nbefore she had been able to enjoy the fruits of liberty. For they had\nloved one another much, and her death had been to them both a hard and\nbitter thing. And, as Old Abe spoke, he could remember, as distinctly\nas though they had been spoken but an hour before, the words of comfort\nthat the teacher had whispered to Nancy in her dying hour and to him in\nhis bereavement.\n\n\"On consideration, Mr. Chairman,\" he said, with an effort to hide a\nsuspicious tremor in his voice and to speak with the dignity consistent\nwith his character as a substantial citizen, \"I wish to record my vote\nfer Miss Noble.\"\n\n\"The chair,\" said Gillespie, yielding gracefully to the majority, and\ngreatly relieved that the responsibility of his candidate's defeat\nlay elsewhere, \"will make the vote unanimous, and will appoint Brother\nCotten and Brother Johnson a committee to step round the corner to Miss\nNoble's and notify her of her election.\"\n\nThe two committeemen put on their hats, and, accompanied by several\npeople who had been waiting at the door to hear the result of the\nmeeting, went around the corner to Miss Noble's house, a distance of a\nblock or two away. The house was lighted, so they knew she had not gone\nto bed. They went in at the gate, and Cotten knocked at the door.\n\nThe colored maid opened it.\n\n\"Is Miss Noble home?\" said Cotten.\n\n\"Yes; come in. She's waitin' ter hear from the committee.\"\n\nThe woman showed them into the parlor. Miss Noble rose from her seat by\nthe table, where she had been reading, and came forward to meet them.\nThey did not for a moment observe, as she took a step toward them, that\nher footsteps wavered. In her agitation she was scarcely aware of it\nherself.\n\n\"Miss Noble,\" announced Cotten, \"we have come to let you know that you\nhave be'n 'lected teacher of the grammar school fer the next year.\"\n\n\"Thank you; oh, thank you so much!\" she said. \"I am very glad.\nMary\"--she put her hand to her side suddenly and tottered--\"Mary, will\nyou--\"\n\nA spasm of pain contracted her face and cut short her speech. She would\nhave fallen had Old Abe not caught her and, with Mary's help, laid her\non a couch.\n\nThe remedies applied by Mary, and by the physician who was hastily\nsummoned, proved unavailing. The teacher did not regain consciousness.\n\nIf it be given to those whose eyes have closed in death to linger\nregretfully for a while about their earthly tenement, or from some\nhigher vantage-ground to look down upon it, then Henrietta Noble's\ntolerant spirit must have felt, mingling with its regret, a compensating\nthrill of pleasure; for not only those for whom she had labored sorrowed\nfor her, but the people of her own race, many of whom, in the blindness\nof their pride, would not admit during her life that she served them\nalso, saw so much clearer now that they took charge of her poor clay,\nand did it gentle reverence, and laid it tenderly away amid the dust of\ntheir own loved and honored dead.\n\nTWO weeks after Miss Noble's funeral the other candidate took charge of\nthe grammar school, which went on without any further obstacles to the\nmarch of progress.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FREEDMEN'S BUREAU by W. E. Burghardt Du Bois\n\n\nThe problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line;\nthe relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and\nAfrica, in America and the islands of the sea. It was a phase of this\nproblem that caused the Civil War; and however much they who marched\nsouth and north in 1861 may have fixed on the technical points of union\nand local autonomy as a shibboleth, all nevertheless knew, as we know,\nthat the question of Negro slavery was the deeper cause of the conflict.\nCurious it was, too, how this deeper question ever forced itself to the\nsurface, despite effort and disclaimer. No sooner had Northern armies\ntouched Southern soil than this old question, newly guised, sprang\nfrom the earth,--What shall be done with slaves? Peremptory military\ncommands, this way and that, could not answer the query; the\nEmancipation Proclamation seemed but to broaden and intensify the\ndifficulties; and so at last there arose in the South a government of\nmen called the Freedmen's Bureau, which lasted, legally, from 1865 to\n1872, but in a sense from 1861 to 1876, and which sought to settle the\nNegro problems in the United States of America.\n\nIt is the aim of this essay to study the Freedmen's Bureau,--the\noccasion of its rise, the character of its work, and its final success\nand failure,--not only as a part of American history, but above all as\none of the most singular and interesting of the attempts made by a great\nnation to grapple with vast problems of race and social condition.\n\nNo sooner had the armies, east and west, penetrated Virginia and\nTennessee than fugitive slaves appeared within their lines. They came at\nnight, when the flickering camp fires of the blue hosts shone like vast\nunsteady stars along the black horizon: old men, and thin, with gray\nand tufted hair; women with frightened eyes, dragging whimpering,\nhungry children; men and girls, stalwart and gaunt,--a horde of starving\nvagabonds, homeless, helpless, and pitiable in their dark distress. Two\nmethods of treating these newcomers seemed equally logical to opposite\nsorts of minds. Said some, \"We have nothing to do with slaves.\"\n\"Hereafter,\" commanded Halleck, \"no slaves should be allowed to come\ninto your lines at all; if any come without your knowledge, when owners\ncall for them, deliver them.\" But others said, \"We take grain and fowl;\nwhy not slaves?\" Whereupon Fremont, as early as August, 1861, declared\nthe slaves of Missouri rebels free. Such radical action was quickly\ncountermanded, but at the same time the opposite policy could not be\nenforced; some of the black refugees declared themselves freemen, others\nshowed their masters had deserted them, and still others were captured\nwith forts and plantations. Evidently, too, slaves were a source\nof strength to the Confederacy, and were being used as laborers and\nproducers. \"They constitute a military resource,\" wrote the Secretary of\nWar, late in 1861; \"and being such, that they should not be turned over\nto the enemy is too plain to discuss.\" So the tone of the army chiefs\nchanged, Congress forbade the rendition of fugitives, and Butler's\n\"contrabands\" were welcomed as military laborers. This complicated\nrather than solved the problem; for now the scattering fugitives became\na steady stream, which flowed faster as the armies marched.\n\nThen the long-headed man, with care-chiseled face, who sat in the White\nHouse, saw the inevitable, and emancipated the slaves of rebels on New\nYear's, 1863. A month later Congress called earnestly for the Negro\nsoldiers whom the act of July, 1862, had half grudgingly allowed to\nenlist. Thus the barriers were leveled, and the deed was done. The\nstream of fugitives swelled to a flood, and anxious officers kept\ninquiring: \"What must be done with slaves arriving almost daily? Am I to\nfind food and shelter for women and children?\"\n\nIt was a Pierce of Boston who pointed out the way, and thus became in\na sense the founder of the Freedmen's Bureau. Being specially detailed\nfrom the ranks to care for the freedmen at Fortress Monroe, he afterward\nfounded the celebrated Port Royal experiment and started the Freedmen's\nAid Societies. Thus, under the timid Treasury officials and bold army\nofficers, Pierce's plan widened and developed. At first, the able-bodied\nmen were enlisted as soldiers or hired as laborers, the women\nand children were herded into central camps under guard, and\n\"superintendents of contrabands\" multiplied here and there. Centres\nof massed freedmen arose at Fortress Monroe, Va., Washington, D. C.,\nBeaufort and Port Royal, S. C., New Orleans, La., Vicksburg and Corinth,\nMiss., Columbus, Ky., Cairo, Ill., and elsewhere, and the army chaplains\nfound here new and fruitful fields.\n\nThen came the Freedmen's Aid Societies, born of the touching appeals for\nrelief and help from these centres of distress. There was the American\nMissionary Association, sprung from the Amistad, and now full grown for\nwork, the various church organizations, the National Freedmen's Relief\nAssociation, the American Freedmen's Union, the Western Freedmen's\nAid Commission,--in all fifty or more active organizations, which sent\nclothes, money, school-books, and teachers southward. All they did was\nneeded, for the destitution of the freedmen was often reported as \"too\nappalling for belief,\" and the situation was growing daily worse rather\nthan better.\n\nAnd daily, too, it seemed more plain that this was no ordinary matter of\ntemporary relief, but a national crisis; for here loomed a labor problem\nof vast dimensions. Masses of Negroes stood idle, or, if they worked\nspasmodically, were never sure of pay; and if perchance they received\npay, squandered the new thing thoughtlessly. In these and in other\nways were camp life and the new liberty demoralizing the freedmen. The\nbroader economic organization thus clearly demanded sprang up here and\nthere as accident and local conditions determined. Here again Pierce's\nPort Royal plan of leased plantations and guided workmen pointed out the\nrough way. In Washington, the military governor, at the urgent appeal of\nthe superintendent, opened confiscated estates to the cultivation of\nthe fugitives, and there in the shadow of the dome gathered black farm\nvillages. General Dix gave over estates to the freedmen of Fortress\nMonroe, and so on through the South. The government and the benevolent\nsocieties furnished the means of cultivation, and the Negro turned again\nslowly to work. The systems of control, thus started, rapidly grew, here\nand there, into strange little governments, like that of General\nBanks in Louisiana, with its 90,000 black subjects, its 50,000 guided\nlaborers, and its annual budget of $100,000 and more. It made out\n4000 pay rolls, registered all freedmen, inquired into grievances and\nredressed them, laid and collected taxes, and established a system of\npublic schools. So too Colonel Eaton, the superintendent of Tennessee\nand Arkansas, ruled over 100,000, leased and cultivated 7000 acres of\ncotton land, and furnished food for 10,000 paupers. In South Carolina\nwas General Saxton, with his deep interest in black folk. He succeeded\nPierce and the Treasury officials, and sold forfeited estates, leased\nabandoned plantations, encouraged schools, and received from Sherman,\nafter the terribly picturesque march to the sea, thousands of the\nwretched camp followers.\n\nThree characteristic things one might have seen in Sherman's raid\nthrough Georgia, which threw the new situation in deep and shadowy\nrelief: the Conqueror, the Conquered, and the Negro. Some see all\nsignificance in the grim front of the destroyer, and some in the bitter\nsufferers of the lost cause. But to me neither soldier nor fugitive\nspeaks with so deep a meaning as that dark and human cloud that clung\nlike remorse on the rear of those swift columns, swelling at times to\nhalf their size, almost engulfing and choking them. In vain were they\nordered back, in vain were bridges hewn from beneath their feet; on\nthey trudged and writhed and surged, until they rolled into Savannah,\na starved and naked horde of tens of thousands. There too came the\ncharacteristic military remedy: \"The islands from Charleston south, the\nabandoned ricefields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the\nsea, and the country bordering the St. John's River, Florida, are\nreserved and set apart for the settlement of Negroes now made free by\nact of war.\" So read the celebrated field order.\n\nAll these experiments, orders, and systems were bound to attract and\nperplex the government and the nation. Directly after the Emancipation\nProclamation, Representative Eliot had introduced a bill creating a\nBureau of Emancipation, but it was never reported. The following June,\na committee of inquiry, appointed by the Secretary of War, reported\nin favor of a temporary bureau for the \"improvement, protection,\nand employment of refugee freedmen,\" on much the same lines as were\nafterward followed. Petitions came in to President Lincoln from\ndistinguished citizens and organizations, strongly urging a\ncomprehensive and unified plan of dealing with the freedmen, under a\nbureau which should be \"charged with the study of plans and execution of\nmeasures for easily guiding, and in every way judiciously and humanely\naiding, the passage of our emancipated and yet to be emancipated blacks\nfrom the old condition of forced labor to their new state of voluntary\nindustry.\"\n\nSome half-hearted steps were early taken by the government to put both\nfreedmen and abandoned estates under the supervision of the Treasury\nofficials. Laws of 1863 and 1864 directed them to take charge of and\nlease abandoned lands for periods not exceeding twelve months, and to\n\"provide in such leases or otherwise for the employment and general\nwelfare\" of the freedmen. Most of the army officers looked upon this\nas a welcome relief from perplexing \"Negro affairs;\" but the Treasury\nhesitated and blundered, and although it leased large quantities of land\nand employed many Negroes, especially along the Mississippi, yet it\nleft the virtual control of the laborers and their relations to their\nneighbors in the hands of the army.\n\nIn March, 1864, Congress at last turned its attention to the subject,\nand the House passed a bill, by a majority of two, establishing a Bureau\nfor Freedmen in the War Department. Senator Sumner, who had charge of\nthe bill in the Senate, argued that freedmen and abandoned lands ought\nto be under the same department, and reported a substitute for the House\nbill, attaching the Bureau to the Treasury Department. This bill passed,\nbut too late for action in the House. The debate wandered over the\nwhole policy of the administration and the general question of slavery,\nwithout touching very closely the specific merits of the measure in\nhand.\n\nMeantime the election took place, and the administration, returning from\nthe country with a vote of renewed confidence, addressed itself to the\nmatter more seriously. A conference between the houses agreed upon a\ncarefully drawn measure which contained the chief provisions of\nCharles Sumner's bill, but made the proposed organization a department\nindependent of both the War and Treasury officials. The bill was\nconservative, giving the new department \"general superintendence of all\nfreedmen.\" It was to \"establish regulations\" for them, protect them,\nlease them lands, adjust their wages, and appear in civil and military\ncourts as their \"next friend.\" There were many limitations attached\nto the powers thus granted, and the organization was made permanent.\nNevertheless, the Senate defeated the bill, and a new conference\ncommittee was appointed. This committee reported a new bill, February\n28, which was whirled through just as the session closed, and which\nbecame the act of 1865 establishing in the War Department a \"Bureau of\nRefugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands.\"\n\nThis last compromise was a hasty bit of legislation, vague and uncertain\nin outline. A Bureau was created, \"to continue during the present War\nof Rebellion, and for one year thereafter,\" to which was given \"the\nsupervision and management of all abandoned lands, and the control of\nall subjects relating to refugees and freedmen,\" under \"such rules and\nregulations as may be presented by the head of the Bureau and approved\nby the President.\" A commissioner, appointed by the President and\nSenate, was to control the Bureau, with an office force not exceeding\nten clerks. The President might also appoint commissioners in the\nseceded states, and to all these offices military officials might be\ndetailed at regular pay. The Secretary of War could issue rations,\nclothing, and fuel to the destitute, and all abandoned property was\nplaced in the hands of the Bureau for eventual lease and sale to\nex-slaves in forty-acre parcels.\n\nThus did the United States government definitely assume charge of\nthe emancipated Negro as the ward of the nation. It was a tremendous\nundertaking. Here, at a stroke of the pen, was erected a government\nof millions of men,--and not ordinary men, either, but black men\nemasculated by a peculiarly complete system of slavery, centuries old;\nand now, suddenly, violently, they come into a new birthright, at a time\nof war and passion, in the midst of the stricken, embittered population\nof their former masters. Any man might well have hesitated to assume\ncharge of such a work, with vast responsibilities, indefinite powers,\nand limited resources. Probably no one but a soldier would have answered\nsuch a call promptly; and indeed no one but a soldier could be called,\nfor Congress had appropriated no money for salaries and expenses.\n\nLess than a month after the weary emancipator passed to his rest,\nhis successor assigned Major General Oliver O. Howard to duty\nas commissioner of the new Bureau. He was a Maine man, then only\nthirty-five years of age. He had marched with Sherman to the sea, had\nfought well at Gettysburg, and had but a year before been assigned to\nthe command of the Department of Tennessee. An honest and sincere\nmen, with rather too much faith in human nature, little aptitude\nfor systematic business and intricate detail, he was nevertheless\nconservative, hard-working, and, above all, acquainted at first-hand\nwith much of the work before him. And of that work it has been truly\nsaid, \"No approximately correct history of civilization can ever be\nwritten which does not throw out in bold relief, as one of the great\nlandmarks of political and social progress, the organization and\nadministration of the Freedmen's Bureau.\"\n\nOn May 12, 1865, Howard was appointed, and he assumed the duties of his\noffice promptly on the 15th, and began examining the field of work. A\ncurious mess he looked upon: little despotisms, communistic experiments,\nslavery, peonage, business speculations, organized charity, unorganized\nalmsgiving,--all reeling on under the guise of helping the freedman, and\nall enshrined in the smoke and blood of war and the cursing and silence\nof angry men. On May 19 the new government--for a government it really\nwas--issued its constitution; commissioners were to be appointed in each\nof the seceded states, who were to take charge of \"all subjects relating\nto refugees and freedmen,\" and all relief and rations were to be given\nby their consent alone. The Bureau invited continued cooperation with\nbenevolent societies, and declared, \"It will be the object of all\ncommissioners to introduce practicable systems of compensated labor,\"\nand to establish schools. Forthwith nine assistant commissioners were\nappointed. They were to hasten to their fields of work; seek gradually\nto close relief establishments, and make the destitute self-supporting;\nact as courts of law where there were no courts, or where Negroes were\nnot recognized in them as free; establish the institution of marriage\namong ex-slaves, and keep records; see that freedmen were free to\nchoose their employers, and help in making fair contracts for them; and\nfinally, the circular said, \"Simple good faith, for which we hope on\nall hands for those concerned in the passing away of slavery, will\nespecially relieve the assistant commissioners in the discharge of their\nduties toward the freedmen, as well as promote the general welfare.\"\n\nNo sooner was the work thus started, and the general system and local\norganization in some measure begun, than two grave difficulties appeared\nwhich changed largely the theory and outcome of Bureau work. First,\nthere were the abandoned lands of the South. It had long been the more\nor less definitely expressed theory of the North that all the chief\nproblems of emancipation might be settled by establishing the slaves on\nthe forfeited lands of their masters,--a sort of poetic justice, said\nsome. But this poetry done into solemn prose meant either wholesale\nconfiscation of private property in the South, or vast appropriations.\nNow Congress had not appropriated a cent, and no sooner did the\nproclamations of general amnesty appear than the 800,000 acres of\nabandoned lands in the hands of the Freedmen's Bureau melted quickly\naway. The second difficulty lay in perfecting the local organization of\nthe Bureau throughout the wide field of work. Making a new machine and\nsending out officials of duly ascertained fitness for a great work of\nsocial reform is no child's task; but this task was even harder, for\na new central organization had to be fitted on a heterogeneous and\nconfused but already existing system of relief and control of ex-slaves;\nand the agents available for this work must be sought for in an army\nstill busy with war operations,--men in the very nature of the case\nill fitted for delicate social work,--or among the questionable camp\nfollowers of an invading host. Thus, after a year's work, vigorously as\nit was pushed, the problem looked even more difficult to grasp and solve\nthan at the beginning. Nevertheless, three things that year's work did,\nwell worth the doing: it relieved a vast amount of physical suffering;\nit transported 7000 fugitives from congested centres back to the\nfarm; and, best of all, it inaugurated the crusade of the New England\nschoolma'am.\n\nThe annals of this Ninth Crusade are yet to be written, the tale of a\nmission that seemed to our age far more quixotic than the quest of\nSt. Louis seemed to his. Behind the mists of ruin and rapine waved the\ncalico dresses of women who dared, and after the hoarse mouthings of\nthe field guns rang the rhythm of the alphabet. Rich and poor they were,\nserious and curious. Bereaved now of a father, now of a brother, now of\nmore than these, they came seeking a life work in planting New England\nschoolhouses among the white and black of the South. They did their work\nwell. In that first year they taught 100,000 souls, and more.\n\nEvidently, Congress must soon legislate again on the hastily organized\nBureau, which had so quickly grown into wide significance and vast\npossibilities. An institution such as that was well-nigh as difficult to\nend as to begin. Early in 1866 Congress took up the matter, when Senator\nTrumbull, of Illinois, introduced a bill to extend the Bureau and\nenlarge its powers. This measure received, at the hands of Congress,\nfar more thorough discussion and attention than its predecessor. The war\ncloud had thinned enough to allow a clearer conception of the work of\nemancipation. The champions of the bill argued that the strengthening of\nthe Freedmen's Bureau was still a military necessity; that it was needed\nfor the proper carrying out of the Thirteenth Amendment, and was a work\nof sheer justice to the ex-slave, at a trifling cost to the government.\nThe opponents of the measure declared that the war was over, and the\nnecessity for war measures past; that the Bureau, by reason of its\nextraordinary powers, was clearly unconstitutional in time of peace,\nand was destined to irritate the South and pauperize the freedmen, at a\nfinal cost of possibly hundreds of millions. Two of these arguments\nwere unanswered, and indeed unanswerable: the one that the extraordinary\npowers of the Bureau threatened the civil rights of all citizens; and\nthe other that the government must have power to do what manifestly\nmust be done, and that present abandonment of the freedmen meant their\npractical enslavement. The bill which finally passed enlarged and made\npermanent the Freedmen's Bureau. It was promptly vetoed by President\nJohnson, as \"unconstitutional,\" \"unnecessary,\" and \"extrajudicial,\" and\nfailed of passage over the veto. Meantime, however, the breach between\nCongress and the President began to broaden, and a modified form of the\nlost bill was finally passed over the President's second veto, July 16.\n\nThe act of 1866 gave the Freedmen's Bureau its final form,--the form by\nwhich it will be known to posterity and judged of men. It extended\nthe existence of the Bureau to July, 1868; it authorized additional\nassistant commissioners, the retention of army officers mustered out\nof regular service, the sale of certain forfeited lands to freedmen\non nominal terms, the sale of Confederate public property for Negro\nschools, and a wider field of judicial interpretation and cognizance.\nThe government of the un-reconstructed South was thus put very largely\nin the hands of the Freedmen's Bureau, especially as in many cases\nthe departmental military commander was now made also assistant\ncommissioner. It was thus that the Freedmen's Bureau became a\nfull-fledged government of men. It made laws, executed them and\ninterpreted them; it laid and collected taxes, defined and punished\ncrime, maintained and used military force, and dictated such measures\nas it thought necessary and proper for the accomplishment of its varied\nends. Naturally, all these powers were not exercised continuously nor to\ntheir fullest extent; and yet, as General Howard has said, \"scarcely any\nsubject that has to be legislated upon in civil society failed, at one\ntime or another, to demand the action of this singular Bureau.\"\n\nTo understand and criticise intelligently so vast a work, one must not\nforget an instant the drift of things in the later sixties: Lee\nhad surrendered, Lincoln was dead, and Johnson and Congress were at\nloggerheads; the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted, the Fourteenth\npending, and the Fifteenth declared in force in 1870. Guerrilla raiding,\nthe ever present flickering after-flame of war, was spending its force\nagainst the Negroes, and all the Southern land was awakening as from\nsome wild dream to poverty and social revolution. In a time of perfect\ncalm, amid willing neighbors and streaming wealth, the social uplifting\nof 4,000,000 slaves to an assured and self-sustaining place in the body\npolitic and economic would have been an herculean task; but when to the\ninherent difficulties of so delicate and nice a social operation were\nadded the spite and hate of conflict, the Hell of War; when suspicion\nand cruelty were rife, and gaunt Hunger wept beside Bereavement,--in\nsuch a case, the work of any instrument of social regeneration was in\nlarge part foredoomed to failure. The very name of the Bureau stood for\na thing in the South which for two centuries and better men had refused\neven to argue,--that life amid free Negroes was simply unthinkable, the\nmaddest of experiments. The agents which the Bureau could command varied\nall the way from unselfish philanthropists to narrow-minded busybodies\nand thieves; and even though it be true that the average was far better\nthan the worst, it was the one fly that helped to spoil the ointment.\nThen, amid all this crouched the freed slave, bewildered between friend\nand foe. He had emerged from slavery: not the worst slavery in the\nworld, not a slavery that made all life unbearable,--rather, a\nslavery that had here and there much of kindliness, fidelity, and\nhappiness,--but withal slavery, which, so far as human aspiration and\ndesert were concerned, classed the black man and the ox together. And\nthe Negro knew full well that, whatever their deeper convictions may\nhave been, Southern men had fought with desperate energy to perpetuate\nthis slavery, under which the black masses, with half-articulate\nthought, had writhed and shivered. They welcomed freedom with a cry.\nThey fled to the friends that had freed them. They shrank from the\nmaster who still strove for their chains. So the cleft between the white\nand black South grew. Idle to say it never should have been; it was as\ninevitable as its results were pitiable. Curiously incongruous elements\nwere left arrayed against each other: the North, the government, the\ncarpetbagger, and the slave, here; and there, all the South that was\nwhite, whether gentleman or vagabond, honest man or rascal, lawless\nmurderer or martyr to duty.\n\nThus it is doubly difficult to write of this period calmly, so intense\nwas the feeling, so mighty the human passions, that swayed and blinded\nmen. Amid it all two figures ever stand to typify that day to coming\nmen: the one a gray-haired gentleman, whose fathers had quit themselves\nlike men, whose sons lay in nameless graves, who bowed to the evil of\nslavery because its abolition boded untold ill to all; who stood at\nlast, in the evening of life, a blighted, ruined form, with hate in his\neyes. And the other, a form hovering dark and mother-like, her awful\nface black with the mists of centuries, had aforetime bent in love over\nher white master's cradle, rocked his sons and daughters to sleep, and\nclosed in death the sunken eyes of his wife to the world; ay, too, had\nlaid herself low to his lust and borne a tawny man child to the world,\nonly to see her dark boy's limbs scattered to the winds by midnight\nmarauders riding after Damned Niggers. These were the saddest sights\nof that woeful day; and no man clasped the hands of these two passing\nfigures of the present-past; but hating they went to their long home,\nand hating their children's children live to-day.\n\nHere, then, was the field of work for the Freedmen's Bureau; and since,\nwith some hesitation, it was continued by the act of 1868 till 1869, let\nus look upon four years of its work as a whole. There were, in 1868, 900\nBureau officials scattered from Washington to Texas, ruling, directly\nand indirectly, many millions of men. And the deeds of these rulers\nfall mainly under seven heads,--the relief of physical suffering, the\noverseeing of the beginnings of free labor, the buying and selling\nof land, the establishment of schools, the paying of bounties, the\nadministration of justice, and the financiering of all these activities.\nUp to June, 1869, over half a million patients had been treated by\nBureau physicians and surgeons, and sixty hospitals and asylums had\nbeen in operation. In fifty months of work 21,000,000 free rations were\ndistributed at a cost of over $4,000,000,--beginning at the rate of\n30,000 rations a day in 1865, and discontinuing in 1869. Next came the\ndifficult question of labor. First, 30,000 black men were transported\nfrom the refuges and relief stations back to the farms, back to the\ncritical trial of a new way of working. Plain, simple instructions went\nout from Washington,--the freedom of laborers to choose employers, no\nfixed rates of wages, no peonage or forced labor. So far so good; but\nwhere local agents differed toto coelo in capacity and character, where\nthe personnel was continually changing, the outcome was varied. The\nlargest element of success lay in the fact that the majority of\nthe freedmen were willing, often eager, to work. So contracts were\nwritten,--50,000 in a single state,--laborers advised, wages guaranteed,\nand employers supplied. In truth, the organization became a vast labor\nbureau; not perfect, indeed,--notably defective here and there,--but on\nthe whole, considering the situation, successful beyond the dreams of\nthoughtful men. The two great obstacles which confronted the officers at\nevery turn were the tyrant and the idler: the slaveholder, who believed\nslavery was right, and was determined to perpetuate it under another\nname; and the freedman, who regarded freedom as perpetual rest. These\nwere the Devil and the Deep Sea.\n\nIn the work of establishing the Negroes as peasant proprietors the\nBureau was severely handicapped, as I have shown. Nevertheless,\nsomething was done. Abandoned lands were leased so long as they remained\nin the hands of the Bureau, and a total revenue of $400,000 derived from\nblack tenants. Some other lands to which the nation had gained title\nwere sold, and public lands were opened for the settlement of the few\nblacks who had tools and capital. The vision of landowning, however,\nthe righteous and reasonable ambition for forty acres and a mule\nwhich filled the freedmen's dreams, was doomed in most cases to\ndisappointment. And those men of marvelous hind-sight, who to-day are\nseeking to preach the Negro back to the soil, know well, or ought to\nknow, that it was here, in 1865, that the finest opportunity of binding\nthe black peasant to the soil was lost. Yet, with help and striving, the\nNegro gained some land, and by 1874, in the one state of Georgia, owned\nnear 350,000 acres.\n\nThe greatest success of the Freedmen's Bureau lay in the planting of\nthe free school among Negroes, and the idea of free elementary education\namong all classes in the South. It not only called the schoolmistress\nthrough the benevolent agencies, and built them schoolhouses, but it\nhelped discover and support such apostles of human development as Edmund\nWare, Erastus Cravath, and Samuel Armstrong. State superintendents of\neducation were appointed, and by 1870 150,000 children were in school.\nThe opposition to Negro education was bitter in the South, for the South\nbelieved an educated Negro to be a dangerous Negro. And the South was\nnot wholly wrong; for education among all kinds of men always has\nhad, and always will have, an element of danger and revolution, of\ndissatisfaction and discontent. Nevertheless, men strive to know. It was\nsome inkling of this paradox, even in the unquiet days of the Bureau,\nthat allayed an opposition to human training, which still to-day lies\nsmouldering, but not flaming. Fisk, Atlanta, Howard, and Hampton were\nfounded in these days, and nearly $6,000,000 was expended in five\nyears for educational work, $750,000 of which came from the freedmen\nthemselves.\n\nSuch contributions, together with the buying of land and various other\nenterprises, showed that the ex-slave was handling some free capital\nalready. The chief initial source of this was labor in the army, and his\npay and bounty as a soldier. Payments to Negro soldiers were at first\ncomplicated by the ignorance of the recipients, and the fact that the\nquotas of colored regiments from Northern states were largely filled by\nrecruits from the South, unknown to their fellow soldiers. Consequently,\npayments were accompanied by such frauds that Congress, by joint\nresolution in 1867, put the whole matter in the hands of the Freedmen's\nBureau. In two years $6,000,000 was thus distributed to 5000 claimants,\nand in the end the sum exceeded $8,000,000. Even in this system, fraud\nwas frequent; but still the work put needed capital in the hands of\npractical paupers, and some, at least, was well spent.\n\nThe most perplexing and least successful part of the Bureau's work lay\nin the exercise of its judicial functions. In a distracted land where\nslavery had hardly fallen, to keep the strong from wanton abuse of the\nweak, and the weak from gloating insolently over the half-shorn strength\nof the strong, was a thankless, hopeless task. The former masters of\nthe land were peremptorily ordered about, seized and imprisoned, and\npunished over and again, with scant courtesy from army officers. The\nformer slaves were intimidated, beaten, raped, and butchered by angry\nand revengeful men. Bureau courts tended to become centres simply for\npunishing whites, while the regular civil courts tended to become solely\ninstitutions for perpetuating the slavery of blacks. Almost every law\nand method ingenuity could devise was employed by the legislatures to\nreduce the Negroes to serfdom,--to make them the slaves of the state,\nif not of individual owners; while the Bureau officials too often were\nfound striving to put the \"bottom rail on top,\" and give the freedmen\na power and independence which they could not yet use. It is all well\nenough for us of another generation to wax wise with advice to those who\nbore the burden in the heat of the day. It is full easy now to see that\nthe man who lost home, fortune, and family at a stroke, and saw his land\nruled by \"mules and niggers,\" was really benefited by the passing of\nslavery. It is not difficult now to say to the young freedman, cheated\nand cuffed about, who has seen his father's head beaten to a jelly and\nhis own mother namelessly assaulted, that the meek shall inherit\nthe earth. Above all, nothing is more convenient than to heap on the\nFreedmen's Bureau all the evils of that evil day, and damn it utterly\nfor every mistake and blunder that was made.\n\nAll this is easy, but it is neither sensible nor just. Some one had\nblundered, but that was long before Oliver Howard was born; there was\ncriminal aggression and heedless neglect, but without some system of\ncontrol there would have been far more than there was. Had that control\nbeen from within, the Negro would have been reenslaved, to all intents\nand purposes. Coming as the control did from without, perfect men and\nmethods would have bettered all things; and even with imperfect agents\nand questionable methods, the work accomplished was not undeserving\nof much commendation. The regular Bureau court consisted of one\nrepresentative of the employer, one of the Negro, and one of the Bureau.\nIf the Bureau could have maintained a perfectly judicial attitude,\nthis arrangement would have been ideal, and must in time have gained\nconfidence; but the nature of its other activities and the character of\nits personnel prejudiced the Bureau in favor of the black litigants, and\nled without doubt to much injustice and annoyance. On the other hand, to\nleave the Negro in the hands of Southern courts was impossible.\n\nWhat the Freedmen's Bureau cost the nation is difficult to determine\naccurately. Its methods of bookkeeping were not good, and the whole\nsystem of its work and records partook of the hurry and turmoil of\nthe time. General Howard himself disbursed some $15,000,000 during his\nincumbency; but this includes the bounties paid colored soldiers, which\nperhaps should not be counted as an expense of the Bureau. In bounties,\nprize money, and all other expenses, the Bureau disbursed over\n$20,000,000 before all of its departments were finally closed. To this\nought to be added the large expenses of the various departments of\nNegro affairs before 1865; but these are hardly extricable from war\nexpenditures, nor can we estimate with any accuracy the contributions of\nbenevolent societies during all these years.\n\n\nSuch was the work of the Freedmen's Bureau. To sum it up in brief, we\nmay say: it set going a system of free labor; it established the black\npeasant proprietor; it secured the recognition of black freemen before\ncourts of law; it founded the free public school in the South. On the\nother hand, it failed to establish good will between ex-masters and\nfreedmen; to guard its work wholly from paternalistic methods\nthat discouraged self-reliance; to make Negroes landholders in any\nconsiderable numbers. Its successes were the result of hard work,\nsupplemented by the aid of philanthropists and the eager striving of\nblack men. Its failures were the result of bad local agents, inherent\ndifficulties of the work, and national neglect. The Freedmen's\nBureau expired by limitation in 1869, save its educational and bounty\ndepartments. The educational work came to an end in 1872, and General\nHoward's connection with the Bureau ceased at that time. The work of\npaying bounties was transferred to the adjutant general's office, where\nit was continued three or four years longer.\n\nSuch an institution, from its wide powers, great responsibilities, large\ncontrol of moneys, and generally conspicuous position, was naturally\nopen to repeated and bitter attacks. It sustained a searching\ncongressional investigation at the instance of Fernando Wood in 1870. It\nwas, with blunt discourtesy, transferred from Howard's control, in his\nabsence, to the supervision of Secretary of War Belknap in 1872, on the\nSecretary's recommendation. Finally, in consequence of grave intimations\nof wrongdoing made by the Secretary and his subordinates, General Howard\nwas court-martialed in 1874. In each of these trials, and in other\nattacks, the commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau was exonerated from\nany willful misdoing, and his work heartily commended. Nevertheless,\nmany unpleasant things were brought to light: the methods of transacting\nthe business of the Bureau were faulty; several cases of defalcation\namong officials in the field were proven, and further frauds hinted\nat; there were some business transactions which savored of dangerous\nspeculation, if not dishonesty; and, above all, the smirch of the\nFreedmen's Bank, which, while legally distinct from, was morally and\npractically a part of the Bureau, will ever blacken the record of this\ngreat institution. Not even ten additional years of slavery could have\ndone as much to throttle the thrift of the freedmen as the mismanagement\nand bankruptcy of the savings bank chartered by the nation for their\nespecial aid. Yet it is but fair to say that the perfect honesty of\npurpose and unselfish devotion of General Howard have passed untarnished\nthrough the fire of criticism. Not so with all his subordinates,\nalthough in the case of the great majority of these there were shown\nbravery and devotion to duty, even though sometimes linked to narrowness\nand incompetency.\n\nThe most bitter attacks on the Freedmen's Bureau were aimed not so much\nat its conduct or policy under the law as at the necessity for any such\norganization at all. Such attacks came naturally from the border states\nand the South, and they were summed up by Senator Davis, of Kentucky,\nwhen he moved to entitle the act of 1866 a bill \"to promote strife\nand conflict between the white and black races... by a grant of\nunconstitutional power.\" The argument was of tremendous strength, but\nits very strength was its weakness. For, argued the plain common sense\nof the nation, if it is unconstitutional, unpracticable, and futile for\nthe nation to stand guardian over its helpless wards, then there is left\nbut one alternative: to make those wards their own guardians by arming\nthem with the ballot. The alternative offered the nation then was not\nbetween full and restricted Negro suffrage; else every sensible man,\nblack and white, would easily have chosen the latter. It was rather a\nchoice between suffrage and slavery, after endless blood and gold had\nflowed to sweep human bondage away. Not a single Southern legislature\nstood ready to admit a Negro, under any conditions, to the polls; not\na single Southern legislature believed free Negro labor was possible\nwithout a system of restrictions that took all its freedom away; there\nwas scarcely a white man in the South who did not honestly regard\nemancipation as a crime, and its practical nullification as a duty.\nIn such a situation, the granting of the ballot to the black man was a\nnecessity, the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race.\nHad the opposition to government guardianship of Negroes been less\nbitter, and the attachment to the slave system less strong, the social\nseer can well imagine a far better policy: a permanent Freedmen's\nBureau, with a national system of Negro schools; a carefully supervised\nemployment and labor office; a system of impartial protection before the\nregular courts; and such institutions for social betterment as savings\nbanks, land and building associations, and social settlements. All this\nvast expenditure of money and brains might have formed a great school of\nprospective citizenship, and solved in a way we have not yet solved the\nmost perplexing and persistent of the Negro problems.\n\nThat such an institution was unthinkable in 1870 was due in part to\ncertain acts of the Freedmen's Bureau itself. It came to regard its work\nas merely temporary, and Negro suffrage as a final answer to all present\nperplexities. The political ambition of many of its agents and proteges\nled it far afield into questionable activities, until the South, nursing\nits own deep prejudices, came easily to ignore all the good deeds of the\nBureau, and hate its very name with perfect hatred. So the Freedmen's\nBureau died, and its child was the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nThe passing of a great human institution before its work is done, like\nthe untimely passing of a single soul, but leaves a legacy of striving\nfor other men. The legacy of the Freedmen's Bureau is the heavy heritage\nof this generation. Today, when new and vaster problems are destined to\nstrain every fibre of the national mind and soul, would it not be well\nto count this legacy honestly and carefully? For this much all men know:\ndespite compromise, struggle, war, and struggle, the Negro is not free.\nIn the backwoods of the Gulf states, for miles and miles, he may not\nleave the plantation of his birth; in well-nigh the whole rural South\nthe black farmers are peons, bound by law and custom to an economic\nslavery, from which the only escape is death or the penitentiary. In\nthe most cultured sections and cities of the South the Negroes are a\nsegregated servile caste, with restricted rights and privileges. Before\nthe courts, both in law and custom, they stand on a different and\npeculiar basis. Taxation without representation is the rule of their\npolitical life. And the result of all this is, and in nature must have\nbeen, lawlessness and crime. That is the large legacy of the Freedmen's\nBureau, the work it did not do because it could not.\n\n\nI have seen a land right merry with the sun; where children sing, and\nrolling hills lie like passioned women, wanton with harvest. And there\nin the King's Highway sat and sits a figure, veiled and bowed, by which\nthe traveler's footsteps hasten as they go. On the tainted air broods\nfear. Three centuries' thought has been the raising and unveiling of\nthat bowed human heart, and now, behold, my fellows, a century new\nfor the duty and the deed. The problem of the twentieth century is the\nproblem of the color line.\n\n\n\n\nOF THE TRAINING OF BLACK MEN by W. E. Burghardt Du Bois\n\n\nFrom the shimmering swirl of waters where many, many thoughts ago the\nslave-ship first saw the square tower of Jamestown have flowed down to\nour day three streams of thinking: one from the larger world here and\nover-seas, saying, the multiplying of human wants in culture lands calls\nfor the world-wide co-operation of men in satisfying them. Hence arises\na new human unity, pulling the ends of earth nearer, and all men, black,\nyellow, and white. The larger humanity strives to feel in this contact\nof living nations and sleeping hordes a thrill of new life in the world,\ncrying, If the contact of Life and Sleep be Death, shame on such Life.\nTo be sure, behind this thought lurks the afterthought of force and\ndominion,--the making of brown men to delve when the temptation of beads\nand red calico cloys.\n\nThe second thought streaming from the death-ship and the curving river\nis the thought of the older South: the sincere and passionate belief\nthat somewhere between men and cattle God created a tertium quid, and\ncalled it a Negro,--a clownish, simple creature, at times even lovable\nwithin its limitations, but straitly foreordained to walk within the\nVeil. To be sure, behind the thought lurks the afterthought,--some of\nthem with favoring chance might become men, but in sheer self-defense we\ndare not let them, and build about them walls so high, and hang between\nthem and the light a veil so thick, that they shall not even think of\nbreaking through.\n\nAnd last of all there trickles down that third and darker thought, the\nthought of the things themselves, the confused half-conscious mutter\nof men who are black and whitened, crying Liberty, Freedom,\nOpportunity--vouchsafe to us, O boastful World, the chance of living\nmen! To be sure, behind the thought lurks the afterthought: suppose,\nafter all, the World is right and we are less than men? Suppose this mad\nimpulse within is all wrong, some mock mirage from the untrue?\n\nSo here we stand among thoughts of human unity, even through conquest\nand slavery; the inferiority of black men, even if forced by fraud; a\nshriek in the night for the freedom of men who themselves are not yet\nsure of their right to demand it. This is the tangle of thought and\nafterthought wherein we are called to solve the problem of training men\nfor life.\n\nBehind all its curiousness, so attractive alike to sage and dilettante,\nlie its dim dangers, throwing across us shadows at once grotesque and\nawful. Plain it is to us that what the world seeks through desert and\nwild we have within our threshold;--a stalwart laboring force, suited to\nthe semi-tropics; if, deaf to the voice of the Zeitgeist, we refuse to\nuse and develop these men, we risk poverty and loss. If, on the other\nhand, seized by the brutal afterthought, we debauch the race thus caught\nin our talons, selfishly sucking their blood and brains in the future as\nin the past, what shall save us from national decadence? Only that saner\nselfishness which, Education teaches men, can find the rights of all in\nthe whirl of work.\n\nAgain, we may decry the color prejudice of the South, yet it remains\na heavy fact. Such curious kinks of the human mind exist and must\nbe reckoned with soberly. They cannot be laughed away, nor always\nsuccessfully stormed at, nor easily abolished by act of legislature.\nAnd yet they cannot be encouraged by being let alone. They must be\nrecognized as facts, but unpleasant facts; things that stand in the way\nof civilization and religion and common decency. They can be met in but\none way: by the breadth and broadening of human reason, by catholicity\nof taste and culture. And so, too, the native ambition and aspiration\nof men, even though they be black, backward, and ungraceful, must not\nlightly be dealt with. To stimulate wildly weak and untrained minds is\nto play with mighty fires; to flout their striving idly is to welcome\na harvest of brutish crime and shameless lethargy in our very laps. The\nguiding of thought and the deft coordination of deed is at once the path\nof honor and humanity.\n\nAnd so, in this great question of reconciling three vast and partially\ncontradictory streams of thought, the one panacea of Education leaps to\nthe lips of all; such human training as will best use the labor of all\nmen without enslaving or brutalizing; such training as will give us\npoise to encourage the prejudices that bulwark society, and stamp out\nthose that in sheer barbarity deafen us to the wail of prisoned souls\nwithin the Veil, and the mounting fury of shackled men.\n\nBut when we have vaguely said Education will set this tangle straight,\nwhat have we uttered but a truism? Training for life teaches living; but\nwhat training for the profitable living together of black men and\nwhite? Two hundred years ago our task would have seemed easier. Then\nDr. Johnson blandly assured us that education was needed solely for the\nembellishments of life, and was useless for ordinary vermin. To-day we\nhave climbed to heights where we would open at least the outer courts of\nknowledge to all, display its treasures to many, and select the few\nto whom its mystery of Truth is revealed, not wholly by truth or\nthe accidents of the stock market, but at least in part according to\ndeftness and aim, talent and character. This programme, however, we are\nsorely puzzled in carrying out through that part of the land where\nthe blight of slavery fell hardest, and where we are dealing with two\nbackward peoples. To make here in human education that ever necessary\ncombination of the permanent and the contingent--of the ideal and the\npractical in workable equilibrium--has been there, as it ever must be\nin every age and place, a matter of infinite experiment and frequent\nmistakes.\n\nIn rough approximation we may point out four varying decades of work in\nSouthern education since the Civil War. From the close of the war until\n1876 was the period of uncertain groping and temporary relief. There\nwere army schools, mission schools, and schools of the Freedmen's Bureau\nin chaotic disarrangement, seeking system and cooperation. Then followed\nten years of constructive definite effort toward the building of\ncomplete school systems in the South. Normal schools and colleges were\nfounded for the freedmen, and teachers trained there to man the public\nschools. There was the inevitable tendency of war to underestimate the\nprejudice of the master and the ignorance of the slave, and all seemed\nclear sailing out of the wreckage of the storm. Meantime, starting\nin this decade yet especially developing from 1885 to 1895, began the\nindustrial revolution of the South. The land saw glimpses of a new\ndestiny and the stirring of new ideals. The educational system striving\nto complete itself saw new obstacles and a field of work ever broader\nand deeper. The Negro colleges, hurriedly founded, were inadequately\nequipped, illogically distributed, and of varying efficiency and grade;\nthe normal and high schools were doing little more than common school\nwork, and the common schools were training but a third of the children\nwho ought to be in them, and training these too often poorly. At the\nsame time the white South, by reason of its sudden conversion from the\nslavery ideal, by so much the more became set and strengthened in its\nracial prejudice, and crystallized it into harsh law and harsher custom;\nwhile the marvelous pushing forward of the poor white daily threatened\nto take even bread and butter from the mouths of the heavily handicapped\nsons of the freedmen. In the midst, then, of the larger problem of Negro\neducation sprang up the more practical question of work, the inevitable\neconomic quandary that faces a people in the transition from slavery\nto freedom, and especially those who make that change amid hate and\nprejudice, lawlessness and ruthless competition.\n\nThe industrial school springing to notice in this decade, but coming to\nfull recognition in the decade beginning with 1895, was the proffered\nanswer to this combined educational and economic crisis, and an answer\nof singular wisdom and timeliness. From the very first in nearly all the\nschools some attention had been given to training in handiwork, but now\nwas this training first raised to a dignity that brought it in direct\ntouch with the South's magnificent industrial development, and given an\nemphasis which reminded black folk that before the Temple of Knowledge\nswing the Gates of Toil.\n\nYet after all they are but gates, and when turning our eyes from\nthe temporary and the contingent in the Negro problem to the broader\nquestion of the permanent uplifting and civilization of black men in\nAmerica, we have a right to inquire, as this enthusiasm for material\nadvancement mounts to its height, if after all the industrial school is\nthe final and sufficient answer in the training of the Negro race; and\nto ask gently, but in all sincerity, the ever recurring query of the\nages, Is not life more than meat, and the body more than raiment? And\nmen ask this to-day all the more eagerly because of sinister signs in\nrecent educational movements. The tendency is here born of slavery and\nquickened to renewed life by the crazy imperialism of the day, to regard\nhuman beings as among the material resources of a land to be trained\nwith an eye single to future dividends. Race prejudices, which keep\nbrown and black men in their \"places,\" we are coming to regard as useful\nallies with such a theory, no matter how much they may dull the ambition\nand sicken the hearts of struggling human beings. And above all, we\ndaily hear that an education that encourages aspiration, that sets\nthe loftiest of ideals and seeks as an end culture and character than\nbread-winning, is the privilege of white men and the danger and delusion\nof black.\n\nEspecially has criticism been directed against the former educational\nefforts to aid the Negro. In the four periods I have mentioned, we find\nfirst boundless, planless enthusiasm and sacrifice; then the preparation\nof teachers for a vast public school system; then the launching and\nexpansion of that school system amid increasing difficulties; and\nfinally the training of workmen for the new and growing industries. This\ndevelopment has been sharply ridiculed as a logical anomaly and flat\nreversal of nature. Soothly we have been told that first industrial\nand manual training should have taught the Negro to work, then simple\nschools should have taught him to read and write, and finally, after\nyears, high and normal schools could have completed the system, as\nintelligence and wealth demanded.\n\nThat a system logically so complete was historically impossible, it\nneeds but a little thought to prove. Progress in human affairs is more\noften a pull than a push, surging forward of the exceptional man, and\nthe lifting of his duller brethren slowly and painfully to his vantage\nground. Thus it was no accident that gave birth to universities\ncenturies before the common schools, that made fair Harvard the first\nflower of our wilderness. So in the South: the mass of the freedmen\nat the end of the war lacked the intelligence so necessary to modern\nworkingmen. They must first have the common school to teach them to\nread, write, and cipher. The white teachers who flocked South went to\nestablish such a common school system. They had no idea of founding\ncolleges; they themselves at first would have laughed at the idea. But\nthey faced, as all men since them have faced, that central paradox of\nthe South, the social separation of the races. Then it was the sudden\nvolcanic rupture of nearly all relations between black and white, in\nwork and government and family life. Since then a new adjustment of\nrelations in economic and political affairs has grown up,--an adjustment\nsubtle and difficult to grasp, yet singularly ingenious, which leaves\nstill that frightful chasm at the color line across which men pass at\ntheir peril. Thus, then and now, there stand in the South two separate\nworlds; and separate not simply in the higher realms of social\nintercourse, but also in church and school, on railway and street car,\nin hotels and theatres, in streets and city sections, in books and\nnewspapers, in asylums and jails, in hospitals and graveyards. There is\nstill enough of contact for large economic and group cooperation, but\nthe separation is so thorough and deep, that it absolutely precludes\nfor the present between the races anything like that sympathetic and\neffective group training and leadership of the one by the other, such\nas the American Negro and all backward peoples must have for effectual\nprogress.\n\nThis the missionaries of '68 soon saw; and if effective industrial and\ntrade schools were impractical before the establishment of a common\nschool system, just as certainly no adequate common schools could be\nfounded until there were teachers to teach them. Southern whites would\nnot teach them; Northern whites in sufficient numbers could not be had.\nIf the Negro was to learn, he must teach himself, and the most effective\nhelp that could be given him was the establishment of schools to train\nNegro teachers. This conclusion was slowly but surely reached by every\nstudent of the situation until simultaneously, in widely separated\nregions, without consultation or systematic plan, there arose a series\nof institutions designed to furnish teachers for the untaught. Above\nthe sneers of critics at the obvious defects of this procedure must ever\nstand its one crushing rejoinder: in a single generation they put thirty\nthousand black teachers in the South; they wiped out the illiteracy of\nthe majority of the black people of the land, and they made Tuskegee\npossible.\n\nSuch higher training schools tended naturally to deepen broader\ndevelopment: at first they were common and grammar schools, then some\nbecame high schools. And finally, by 1900, some thirty-four had one year\nor more of studies of college grade. This development was reached with\ndifferent degrees of speed in different institutions: Hampton is still\na high school, while Fisk University started her college in 1871, and\nSpelman Seminary about 1896. In all cases the aim was identical: to\nmaintain the standards of the lower training by giving teachers and\nleaders the best practicable training; and above all to furnish the\nblack world with adequate standards of human culture and lofty ideals of\nlife. It was not enough that the teachers of teachers should be trained\nin technical normal methods; they must also, so far as possible, be\nbroad-minded, cultured men and women, to scatter civilization among a\npeople whose ignorance was not simply of letters, but of life itself.\n\nIt can thus be seen that the work of education in the South began with\nhigher institutions of training, which threw off as their foliage common\nschools, and later industrial schools, and at the same time strove to\nshoot their roots ever deeper toward college and university training.\nThat this was an inevitable and necessary development, sooner or later,\ngoes without saying; but there has been, and still is, a question in\nmany minds if the natural growth was not forced, and if the higher\ntraining was not either overdone or done with cheap and unsound methods.\nAmong white Southerners this feeling is widespread and positive. A\nprominent Southern journal voiced this in a recent editorial:\n\n\"The experiment that has been made to give the colored students\nclassical training has not been satisfactory. Even though many were able\nto pursue the course, most of them did so in a parrot-like way, learning\nwhat was taught, but not seeming to appropriate the truth and import\nof their instruction, and graduating without sensible aim or valuable\noccupation for their future. The whole scheme has proved a waste of\ntime, efforts, and the money of the state.\"\n\nWhile most far-minded men would recognize this as extreme and overdrawn,\nstill without doubt many are asking, Are there a sufficient number of\nNegroes ready for college training to warrant the undertaking? Are not\ntoo many students prematurely forced into this work? Does it not have\nthe effect of dissatisfying the young Negro with his environment? And do\nthese graduates succeed in real life? Such natural questions cannot be\nevaded, nor on the other hand must a nation naturally skeptical as to\nNegro ability assume an unfavorable answer without careful inquiry and\npatient openness to conviction. We must not forget that most Americans\nanswer all queries regarding the Negro a priori, and that the least that\nhuman courtesy can do is to listen to evidence.\n\nThe advocates of the higher education of the Negro would be the last to\ndeny the incompleteness and glaring defects of the present system: too\nmany institutions have attempted to do college work, the work in some\ncases has not been thoroughly done, and quantity rather than quality\nhas sometimes been sought. But all this can be said of higher education\nthroughout the land: it is the almost inevitable incident of educational\ngrowth, and leaves the deeper question of the legitimate demand for the\nhigher training of Negroes untouched. And this latter question can be\nsettled in but one way--by a first-hand study of the facts. If we leave\nout of view all institutions which have not actually graduated students\nfrom a course higher than that of a New England high school, even though\nthey be called colleges; if then we take the thirty-four remaining\ninstitutions, we may clear up many misapprehensions by asking\nsearchingly, What kind of institutions are they, what do they teach, and\nwhat sort of men do they graduate?\n\nAnd first we may say that this type of college, including Atlanta, Fisk\nand Howard, Wilberforce and Lincoln, Biddle, Shaw, and the rest, is\npeculiar, almost unique. Through the shining trees that whisper before\nme as I write, I catch glimpses of a boulder of New England granite,\ncovering a grave, which graduates of Atlanta University have placed\nthere:--\n\n\n        \"IN GRATEFUL MEMORY OF THEIR\n        FORMER TEACHER AND FRIEND\n        AND OF THE UNSELFISH LIFE HE\n        LIVED, AND THE NOBLE WORK HE\n        WROUGHT; THAT THEY, THEIR\n        CHILDREN, AND THEIR CHIL-\n        DREN'S CHILDREN MIGHT BE\n            BLESSED.\"\n\n\nThis was the gift of New England to the freed Negro: not alms, but\na friend; not cash, but character. It was not and is not money these\nseething millions want, but love and sympathy, the pulse of hearts\nbeating with red blood; a gift which to-day only their own kindred and\nrace can bring to the masses, but which once saintly souls brought to\ntheir favored children in the crusade of the sixties, that finest thing\nin American history, and one of the few things untainted by sordid greed\nand cheap vainglory. The teachers in these institutions came not to keep\nthe Negroes in their place, but to raise them out of their places where\nthe filth of slavery had wallowed them. The colleges they founded were\nsocial settlements; homes where the best of the sons of the freedmen\ncame in close and sympathetic touch with the best traditions of New\nEngland. They lived and ate together, studies and worked, hoped and\nharkened in the dawning light. In actual formal content their curriculum\nwas doubtless old-fashioned, but in educational power it was supreme,\nfor it was the contact of living souls.\n\nFrom such schools about two thousand Negroes have gone forth with the\nbachelor's degree. The number in itself is enough to put at rest the\nargument that too large a proportion of Negroes are receiving higher\ntraining. If the ratio to population of all Negro students throughout\nthe land, in both college and secondary training, be counted,\nCommissioner Harris assures us \"it must be increased to five times its\npresent average\" to equal the average of the land.\n\nFifty years ago the ability of Negro students in any appreciable numbers\nto master a modern college course would have been difficult to prove.\nTo-day it is proved by the fact that four hundred Negroes, many of whom\nhave been reported as brilliant students, have received the bachelor's\ndegree from Harvard, Yale, Oberlin, and seventy other leading colleges.\nHere we have, then, nearly twenty-five hundred Negro graduates, of whom\nthe crucial query must be made. How far did their training fit them for\nlife? It is of course extremely difficult to collect satisfactory\ndata on such a point,--difficult to reach the men, to get trustworthy\ntestimony, and to gauge that testimony by any generally acceptable\ncriterion of success. In 1900, the Conference at Atlanta University\nundertook to study these graduates, and published the results. First\nthey sought to know what these graduates were doing, and succeeded\nin getting answers from nearly two thirds of the living. The direct\ntestimony was in almost all cases corroborated by the reports of the\ncolleges where they graduated, so that in the main the reports were\nworthy of credence. Fifty-three per cent of these graduates were\nteachers,--presidents of institutions, heads of normal schools,\nprincipals of city school systems, and the like. Seventeen per cent were\nclergymen; another seventeen per cent were in the professions, chiefly\nas physicians. Over six per cent were merchants, farmers, and artisans,\nand four per cent were in the government civil service. Granting\neven that a considerable proportion of the third unheard from are\nunsuccessful, this is a record of usefulness. Personally I know many\nhundreds of these graduates and have corresponded with more than a\nthousand; through others I have followed carefully the life-work of\nscores; I have taught some of them and some of the pupils whom they\nhave taught, lived in homes which they have builded, and looked at life\nthrough their eyes. Comparing them as a class with my fellow students in\nNew England and in Europe, I cannot hesitate in saying that nowhere have\nI met men and women with a broader spirit of helpfulness, with deeper\ndevotion to their life-work, or with more consecrated determination to\nsucceed in the face of bitter difficulties than among Negro college-bred\nmen. They have, to be sure, their proportion of ne'er-do-weels,\ntheir pedants and lettered fools, but they have a surprisingly small\nproportion of them; they have not that culture of manner which we\ninstinctively associate with university men, forgetting that in reality\nit is the heritage from cultured homes, and that no people a generation\nremoved from slavery can escape a certain unpleasant rawness and\ngaucherie, despite the best of training.\n\nWith all their larger vision and deeper sensibility, these men have\nusually been conservative, careful leaders. They have seldom been\nagitators, have withstood the temptation to head the mob, and have\nworked steadily and faithfully in a thousand communities in the South.\nAs teachers they have given the South a commendable system of city\nschools and large numbers of private normal schools and academies.\nColored college-bred men have worked side by side with white college\ngraduates at Hampton; almost from the beginning the backbone of\nTuskegee's teaching force has been formed of graduates from Fisk and\nAtlanta. And to-day the institute is filled with college graduates, from\nthe energetic wife of the principal down to the teacher of agriculture,\nincluding nearly half of the executive council and a majority of the\nheads of departments. In the professions, college men are slowly but\nsurely leavening the Negro church, are healing and preventing the\ndevastations of disease, and beginning to furnish legal protection for\nthe liberty and property of the toiling masses. All this is needful\nwork. Who would do it if Negroes did not? How could Negroes do it if\nthey were not trained carefully for it? If white people need colleges to\nfurnish teachers, ministers, lawyers, and doctors, do black people need\nnothing of the sort?\n\nIf it be true that there are an appreciable number of Negro youth in the\nland capable by character and talent to receive that higher training,\nthe end of which is culture, and if the two and a half thousand who\nhave had something of this training in the past have in the main proved\nthemselves useful to their race and generation, the question then\ncomes, What place in the future development of the South might the\nNegro college and college-bred man to occupy? That the present social\nseparation and acute race sensitiveness must eventually yield to the\ninfluences of culture as the South grows civilized is clear. But such\ntransformation calls for singular wisdom and patience. If, while the\nhealing of this vast sore is progressing, the races are to live for\nmany years side by side, united in economic effort, obeying a common\ngovernment, sensitive to mutual thought and feeling, yet subtly and\nsilently separate in many matters of deeper human intimacy--if this\nunusual and dangerous development is to progress amid peace and order,\nmutual respect and growing intelligence, it will call for social surgery\nat once the delicatest and nicest in modern history. It will demand\nbroad-minded, upright men both white and black, and in its final\naccomplishment American civilization will triumph. So far as white men\nare concerned, this fact is to-day being recognized in the South, and a\nhappy renaissance of university education seems imminent. But the very\nvoices that cry Hail! to this good work are, strange to relate, largely\nsilent or antagonistic to the higher education of the Negro.\n\nStrange to relate! for this is certain, no secure civilization can be\nbuilt in the South with the Negro as an ignorant, turbulent proletariat.\nSuppose we seek to remedy this by making them laborers and nothing more:\nthey are not fools, they have tasted of the Tree of Life, and they will\nnot cease to think, will not cease attempting to read the riddle of\nthe world. By taking away their best equipped teachers and leaders,\nby slamming the door of opportunity in the faces of their bolder and\nbrighter minds, will you make them satisfied with their lot? or will you\nnot rather transfer their leading from the hands of men taught to\nthink to the hands of untrained demagogues? We ought not to forget that\ndespite the pressure of poverty, and despite the active discouragement\nand even ridicule of friends, the demand for higher training steadily\nincreases among Negro youth: there were, in the years from 1875 to 1880,\ntwenty-two Negro graduates from Northern colleges; from 1885 to 1895\nthere were forty-three, and from 1895 to 1900, nearly 100 graduates.\nFrom Southern Negro colleges there were, in the same three periods,\n143, 413, and over 500 graduates. Here, then, is the plain thirst for\ntraining; by refusing to give this Talented Tenth the key to knowledge\ncan any sane man imagine that they will lightly lay aside their yearning\nand contentedly become hewers of wood and drawers of water?\n\nNo. The dangerously clear logic of the Negro's position will more and\nmore loudly assert itself in that day when increasing wealth and more\nintricate social organization preclude the South from being, as it so\nlargely is, simply an armed camp for intimidating black folk. Such\nwaste of energy cannot be spared if the South is to catch up with\ncivilization. And as the black third of the land grows in thrift and\nskill, unless skillfully guided in its larger philosophy, it must more\nand more brood over the red past and the creeping, crooked present,\nuntil it grasps a gospel of revolt and revenge and throws its new-found\nenergies athwart the current of advance. Even to-day the masses of the\nNegroes see all too clearly the anomalies of their position and the\nmoral crookedness of yours. You may marshal strong indictments against\nthem, but their counter-cries, lacking though they be in formal logic,\nhave burning truths within them which you may not wholly ignore, O\nSouthern Gentlemen! If you deplore their presence here, they ask,\nWho brought us? When you shriek, Deliver us from the vision of\nintermarriage, they answer, that legal marriage is infinitely better\nthan systematic concubinage and prostitution. And if in just fury you\naccuse their vagabonds of violating women, they also in fury quite as\njust may wail: the rape which your gentlemen have done against helpless\nblack women in defiance of your own laws is written on the foreheads\nof two millions of mulattoes, and written in ineffaceable blood. And\nfinally, when you fasten crime upon this race as its peculiar\ntrait, they answer that slavery was the arch-crime, and lynching and\nlawlessness its twin abortion; that color and race are not crimes, and\nyet they it is which in this land receive most unceasing condemnation,\nNorth, East, South, and West.\n\nI will not say such arguments are wholly justified--I will not insist\nthat there is no other side to the shield; but I do say that of the nine\nmillions of Negroes in this nation, there is scarcely one out of the\ncradle to whom these arguments do not daily present themselves in the\nguise of terrible truth. I insist that the question of the future is how\nbest to keep these millions from brooding over the wrongs of the past\nand the difficulties of the present, so that all their energies may\nbe bent toward a cheerful striving and cooperation with their white\nneighbors toward a larger, juster, and fuller future. That one wise\nmethod of doing this lies in the closer knitting of the Negro to the\ngreat industrial possibilities of the South is a great truth. And this\nthe common schools and the manual training and trade schools are working\nto accomplish. But these alone are not enough. The foundations of\nknowledge in this race, as in others, must be sunk deep in the college\nand university if we would build a solid, permanent structure. Internal\nproblems of social advance must inevitably come,--problems of work and\nwages, of families and homes, of morals and the true valuing of\nthe things of life; and all these and other inevitable problems of\ncivilization the Negro must meet and solve largely for himself, by\nreason of his isolation; and can there be any possible solution other\nthan by study and thought and an appeal to the rich experience of the\npast? Is there not, with such a group and in such a crisis, infinitely\nmore danger to be apprehended from half-trained minds and shallow\nthinking than from over-education and over-refinement? Surely we have\nwit enough to found a Negro college so manned and equipped as to steer\nsuccessfully between the dilettante and the fool. We shall hardly induce\nblack men to believe that if their bellies be full it matters little\nabout their brains. They already dimly perceive that the paths of peace\nwinding between honest toil and dignified manhood call for the guidance\nof skilled thinkers, the loving, reverent comradeship between the black\nlowly and black men emancipated by training and culture.\n\nThe function of the Negro college then is clear: it must maintain the\nstandards of popular education, it must seek the social regeneration of\nthe Negro, and it must help in the solution of problems of race contact\nand cooperation. And finally, beyond all this, it must develop men.\nAbove our modern socialism, and out of the worship of the mass, must\npersist and evolve that higher individualism which the centres of\nculture protect; there must come a loftier respect for the sovereign\nhuman soul that seeks to know itself and the world about it; that seeks\na freedom for expansion and self-development; that will love and hate\nand labor in its own way, untrammeled alike by old and new. Such souls\naforetime have inspired and guided worlds, and if we be not wholly\nbewitched by our Rhine-gold, they shall again. Herein the longing\nof black men must have respect: the rich and bitter depth of their\nexperience, the unknown treasures of their inner life, the strange\nrendings of nature they have seen, may give the world new points of view\nand make their loving, living, and doing precious to all human hearts.\nAnd to themselves in these the days that try their souls the chance to\nsoar in the dim blue air above the smoke is to their finer spirits boon\nand guerdon for what they lose on earth by being black.\n\n\nI sit with Shakespeare and he winces not. Across the color line I move\narm in arm with Balzac and Dumas, where smiling men and welcoming women\nglide in gilded halls. From out the caves of Evening that swing between\nthe strong-limbed earth and the tracery of the stars, I summon Aristotle\nand Aurelius and what soul I will, and they come all graciously with no\nscorn nor condescension. So, wed with Truth, I dwell above the Veil. Is\nthis the life you grudge us, O knightly America? Is this the life you\nlong to change into the dull red hideousness of Georgia? Are you so\nafraid lest peering from this high Pisgah, between Philistine and\nAmalekite, we sight the Promised Land?\n\n\n\n\nTHE FRUITS OF INDUSTRIAL TRAINING by Booker T. Washington\n\n\nThe political, educational, social, and economic evolution through which\nthe South passed during, say, the first fifteen or twenty years after\nthe close of the civil war furnishes one of the most interesting periods\nthat any country has passed through.\n\nA large share of the thought and activity of the white South, of the\nblack South, and of that section of the North especially interested\nin my race, was directed during the years of the Reconstruction period\ntoward politics, or toward matters bearing upon what were termed civil\nor social rights. The work of education was rather slow, and covered a\nlarge section of the South; still I think I am justified in saying that\nin the public mind the Negro's relation to politics overshadowed nearly\nevery other interest. The education of the race was conducted quietly,\nand attracted comparatively little attention, just as is true at the\npresent time. The appointment of one Negro postmaster at a third or\nfourth rate post office will be given wider publicity through the daily\npress than the founding of a school, or some important discovery in\nscience.\n\nWith reference to the black man's political relation to the state and\nFederal governments, I think I am safe in saying that for many years\nafter the civil war there were sharp and antagonistic views between the\nNorth and the South, as well as between the white South and the black\nSouth. At practically every point where there was a political question\nto be decided in the South the blacks would array themselves on one side\nand the whites on the other. I remember that very soon after I began\nteaching school in Alabama an old colored man came to me just prior to\nan election. He said: \"You can read de newspapers and most of us can't,\nbut dar is one thing dat we knows dat you don't, and dat is how to vote\ndown here; and we wants you to vote as we does.\" He added: \"I tell you\nhow we does. We watches de white man; we keeps watching de white man;\nde nearer it gits to election time de more we watches de white man. We\nwatches him till we finds out which way he gwine to vote. After we finds\nout which way he gwine to vote, den we votes exactly de other way; den\nwe knows we 's right.\"\n\nStories on the other side might be given showing that a certain class of\nwhite people, both at the polls and in the Legislatures, voted just as\nunreasonably in opposing politically what they thought the Negro or the\nNorth wanted, no matter how much benefit might ensue from a contrary\naction. Unfortunately such antagonism did not end with matters\npolitical, but in many cases affected the relation of the races in\nnearly every walk of life. Aside from political strife, there was\nnaturally deep feeling between the North and the South on account of the\nwar. On nearly every question growing out of the war, which was debated\nin Congress, or in political campaigns, there was the keenest difference\nand often the deepest feeling. There was almost no question of even a\nsemi-political nature, or having a remote connection with the Negro,\nupon which there was not sharp and often bitter division between the\nNorth and South. It is needless to say that in many cases the Negro\nwas the sufferer. He was being ground between the upper and nether\nmillstones. Even to this day it is well-nigh impossible, largely by\nreason of the force of habit, in certain states to prevent state and\neven local campaigns from being centred in some form upon the black man.\nIn states like Mississippi, for example, where the Negro ceased nearly\na score of years ago, by operation of law, to be a determining factor\nin politics, he forms in some way the principal fuel for campaign\ndiscussion at nearly every election. The sad feature of this is, that\nit prevents the presentation before the masses of the people of matters\npertaining to local and state improvement, and to great national issues\nlike finance, tariff, or foreign policies. It prevents the masses from\nreceiving the broad and helpful education which every political campaign\nshould furnish, and, what is equally unfortunate, it prevents the youth\nfrom seeing and hearing on the platform the great political leaders of\nthe two national parties. During a national campaign few of the great\nDemocratic leaders debate national questions in the South, because it\nis felt that the old antagonism to the Negro politically will keep the\nSouth voting one way. Few of the great Republican leaders appear on\nSouthern platforms, because they feel that nothing will be gained.\n\nOne of the saddest instances of this situation that has come within my\nknowledge occurred some years ago in a certain Southern state where a\nwhite friend of mine was making the race for Congress on the Democratic\nticket in a district that was overwhelmingly Democratic. I speak of this\nman as my friend, because there was no personal favor in reason which\nhe would have refused me. He was equally friendly to the race, and was\ngenerous in giving for its education, and in helping individuals to\nbuy land. His campaign took him into one of the \"white\" counties, where\nthere were few colored people, and where the whites were unusually\nignorant. I was surprised one morning to read in the daily papers of a\nbitter attack he had made on the Negro while speaking in this county.\nThe next time I saw him I informed him of my surprise. He replied that\nhe was ashamed of what he had said, and that he did not himself believe\nmuch that he had stated, but gave as a reason for his action that he had\nfound himself before an audience which had heard little for thirty years\nin the way of political discussion that did not bear upon the Negro, and\nthat he therefore knew it was almost impossible to interest them in any\nother subject.\n\nBut this is somewhat aside from my purpose, which is, I repeat, to make\nplain that in all political matters there was for years after the war\nno meeting ground of agreement for the two races, or for the North and\nSouth. Upon the question of the Negro's civil rights, as embodied in\nwhat was called the Civil Rights Bill, there was almost the same sharp\nline of division between the races, and, in theory at least, between the\nNorthern and Southern whites,--largely because the former were\nsupposed to be giving the blacks social recognition, and encouraging\nintermingling between the races. The white teachers, who came from\nthe North to work in missionary schools, received for years little\nrecognition or encouragement from the rank and file of their own race.\nThe lines were so sharply drawn that in cities where native Southern\nwhite women taught Negro children in the public schools, they would\nhave no dealings with Northern white women who, perhaps, taught Negro\nchildren from the same family in a missionary school.\n\nI want to call attention here to a phase of Reconstruction policy which\nis often overlooked. All now agree that there was much in Reconstruction\nwhich was unwise and unfortunate. However we may regard that policy, and\nmuch as we may regret mistakes, the fact is too often overlooked that it\nwas during the Reconstruction period that a public school system for the\neducation of all the people of the South was first established in most\nof the states. Much that was done by those in charge of Reconstruction\nlegislation has been overturned, but the public school system still\nremains. True, it has been modified and improved, but the system\nremains, and is every day growing in popularity and strength.\n\nAs to the difference of opinion between the North and the South\nregarding Negro education, I find that many people, especially in the\nNorth, have a wrong conception of the attitude of the Southern white\npeople. It is and has been very generally thought that what is termed\n\"higher education\" of the Negro has been from the first opposed by the\nwhite South. This opinion is far from being correct. I remember that,\nin 1891, when I began the work of establishing the Tuskegee Institute\nin Alabama, practically all of the white people who talked to me on the\nsubject took it for granted that instruction in the Greek, Latin, and\nmodern languages would be one of the main features of our curriculum. I\nheard no one oppose what he thought our course of study was to embrace.\nIn fact, there are many white people in the South at the present time\nwho do not know that instruction in the dead languages is not given at\nthe Tuskegee Institute. In further proof of what I have stated, if one\nwill go through the catalogue of the schools maintained by the states\nfor Negro people, and managed by Southern white people, he will find in\nalmost every case that instruction in the higher branches is given with\nthe consent and approval of white officials. This was true as far back\nas 1880. It is not unusual to meet at this time Southern white people\nwho are as emphatic in their belief in the value of classical education\nas a certain element of colored people themselves. In matters relating\nto civil and political rights, the breach was broad, and without\napparent hope of being bridged; even in the matter of religion,\npractically all of the denominations had split on the subject of the\nNegro, though I should add that there is now, and always has been, a\ncloser touch and more cooperation in matters of religion between the\nwhite and colored people in the South than is generally known. But the\nbreach between the white churches in the South and North remains.\n\nIn matters of education the difference was much less sharp. The truth\nis that a large element in the South had little faith in the efficacy\nof the higher or any other kind of education of the Negro. They were\nindifferent, but did not openly oppose; on the other hand, there has\nalways been a potent element of white people in all of the Southern\nstates who have stood out openly and bravely for the education of\nall the people, regardless of race. This element has thus far been\nsuccessful in shaping and leading public opinion, and I think that it\nwill continue to do so more and more. This statement must not be taken\nto mean that there is as yet an equitable division of the school funds,\nraised by common taxation, between the two races in many sections of the\nSouth, though the Southern states deserve much credit for what has been\ndone. In discussing the small amount of direct taxes the Negro pays, the\nfact that he pays tremendous indirect taxes is often overlooked.\n\nI wish, however, to emphasize the fact that while there was either open\nantagonism or indifference in the directions I have named, it was the\nintroduction of industrial training into the Negro's education\nthat seemed to furnish the first basis for anything like united and\nsympathetic interest and action between the two races in the South and\nbetween the whites in the North and those in the South. Aside from its\ndirect benefit to the black race, industrial education has furnished\na basis for mutual faith and cooperation, which has meant more to the\nSouth, and to the work of education, than has been realized.\n\nThis was, at the least, something in the way of construction. Many\npeople, I think, fail to appreciate the difference between the problems\nnow before us and those that existed previous to the civil war. Slavery\npresented a problem of destruction; freedom presents a problem of\nconstruction.\n\nFrom its first inception the white people of the South had faith in the\ntheory of industrial education, because they had noted, what was\nnot unnatural, that a large element of the colored people at first\ninterpreted freedom to mean freedom from work with the hands. They\nnaturally had not learned to appreciate the fact that they had been\nWORKED, and that one of the great lessons for freemen to learn is to\nWORK. They had not learned the vast difference between WORKING and BEING\nWORKED. The white people saw in the movement to teach the Negro youth\nthe dignity, beauty, and civilizing power of all honorable labor with\nthe hands something that would lead the Negro into his new life of\nfreedom gradually and sensibly, and prevent his going from one extreme\nof life to the other too suddenly. Furthermore, industrial education\nappealed directly to the individual and community interest of the white\npeople. They saw at once that intelligence coupled with skill would add\nwealth to the community and to the state, in which both races would have\nan added share. Crude labor in the days of slavery, they believed, could\nbe handled and made in a degree profitable, but ignorant and unskilled\nlabor in a state of freedom could not be made so. Practically every\nwhite man in the South was interested in agricultural or in mechanical\nor in some form of manual labor; every white man was interested in\nall that related to the home life,--the cooking and serving of food,\nlaundering, dairying, poultry-raising, and housekeeping in general.\nThere was no family whose interest in intelligent and skillful nursing\nwas not now and then quickened by the presence of a trained nurse. As\nalready stated, there was general appreciation of the fact that\nthe industrial education of the black people had direct, vital, and\npractical bearing upon the life of each white family in the South; while\nthere was no such appreciation of the results of mere literary training.\nIf a black man became a lawyer, a doctor, a minister, or an ordinary\nteacher, his professional duties would not ordinarily bring him in touch\nwith the life of the white portion of the community, but rather confine\nhim almost exclusively to his own race. While purely literary or\nprofessional education was not opposed by the white population, it was\nsomething in which they found little or no interest, beyond a confused\nhope that it would result in producing a higher and a better type of\nNegro manhood. The minute it was seen that through industrial education\nthe Negro youth was not only studying chemistry, but also how to apply\nthe knowledge of chemistry to the enrichment of the soil, or to cooking,\nor to dairying, and that the student was being taught not only geometry\nand physics, but their application to blacksmithing, brickmaking,\nfarming, and what not, then there began to appear for the first time\na common bond between the two races and cooperation between North and\nSouth.\n\nOne of the most interesting and valuable instances of the kind that I\nknow of is presented in the case of Mr. George W. Carver, one of our\ninstructors in agriculture at Tuskegee Institute. For some time it has\nbeen his custom to prepare articles containing information concerning\nthe conditions of local crops, and warning the farmers against the\nravages of certain insects and diseases. The local white papers are\nalways glad to publish these articles, and they are read by white and\ncolored farmers.\n\nSome months ago a white land-holder in Montgomery County asked Mr.\nCarver to go through his farm with him for the purpose of inspecting\nit. While doing so Mr. Carver discovered traces of what he thought was\na valuable mineral deposit, used in making a certain kind of paint.\nThe interests of the land-owner and the agricultural instructor at once\nbecame mutual. Specimens of the deposits were taken to the laboratories\nof the Tuskegee Institute and analyzed by Mr. Carver. In due time the\nland-owner received a report of the analysis, together with a statement\nshowing the commercial value and application of the mineral. I shall\nnot go through the whole interesting story, except to say that a stock\ncompany, composed of some of the best white people in Alabama, has been\norganized, and is now preparing to build a factory for the purpose\nof putting their product on the market. I hardly need to add that\nMr. Carver has been freely consulted at every step, and his services\ngenerously recognized in the organization of the concern. When the\ncompany was being formed the following testimonial, among others, was\nembodied in the printed copy of the circular:--\n\n\"George W. Carver, Director of the Department of Agriculture, Tuskegee,\nAlabama, says:--\n\n\"'The pigment is an ochreous clay. Its value as a paint is due to the\npresence of ferric oxide, of which it contains more than any of the\nFrench, Australian, American, Irish, or Welsh ochres. Ferric oxides have\nlong been recognized as the essential constituents of such paints as\nVenetian red, Turkish red, oxide red, Indian red, and scarlet. They are\nmost desirable, being quite permanent when exposed to light and air. As\na stain they are most valuable.'\"\n\nIn further proof of what I wish to emphasize, I think I am safe in\nsaying that the work of the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute,\nunder the late General S. C. Armstrong, was the first to receive any\nkind of recognition and hearty sympathy from the Southern white people,\nand General Armstrong was perhaps the first Northern educator of Negroes\nwho won the confidence and cooperation of the white South. The effects\nof General Armstrong's introduction of industrial education at Hampton,\nand its extension to the Tuskegee Institute in the far South, are now\nactively and helpfully apparent in the splendid work being accomplished\nfor the whole South by the Southern Education Board, with Mr. Robert C.\nOgden at its head, and by the General Education Board, with Mr. William\nH. Baldwin, Jr., as its president. Without the introduction of manual\ntraining it is doubtful whether such work as is now being wrought\nthrough these two boards for both races in the South could have been\npossible within a quarter of a century to come. Later on in the\nhistory of our country it will be recognized and appreciated that the\nfar-reaching and statesman-like efforts of these two boards for general\neducation in the South, under the guidance of the two gentlemen named,\nand with the cooperation and assistance of such men as Mr. George Foster\nPeabody, Dr. Wallace Buttrick, Mr. John D. Rockefeller, of the North,\nand Mr. Edgar Gardner Murphy, Chancellor Hill, Dr. Alderman, Dr. McIver,\nDr. Dabney, and others of the South, will have furnished the material\nfor one of the brightest and most encouraging chapters in the history of\nour country. The fact that we have reached the point where men and women\nwho were so far apart twenty years ago can meet in the South and discuss\nfreely from the same platform questions relating to the industrial,\neducational, political, moral, and religious development of the two\nraces marks a great step in advance. It is true that as yet the Negro\nhas not been invited to share in these discussions.\n\nAside from the reasons I have given showing why the South favored\nindustrial education, coupled with intellectual and moral training,\nmany of the whites saw, for example, that the Negroes who were master\ncarpenters and contractors, under the guidance of their owners, could\nbecome still greater factors in the development of the South if their\nchildren were not suddenly removed from the atmosphere and occupations\nof their fathers, and if they could be taught to use the thing in hand\nas a foundation for higher growth. Many of the white people were wise\nenough to see that such education would enable some of the Negro youths\nto become more skillful carpenters and contractors, and that if they\nlaid an economic foundation in this way in their generation, they would\nbe laying a foundation for a more abstract education of their children\nin the future.\n\nAgain, a large element of people at the South favored manual training\nfor the Negro because they were wise enough to see that the South was\nlargely free from the restrictive influences of the Northern trades\nunions, and that such organizations would secure little hold in the\nSouth so long as the Negro kept abreast in intelligence and skill with\nthe same class of people elsewhere. Many realized that the South would\nbe tying itself to a body of death if it did not help the Negro up. In\nthis connection I want to call attention to the fact that the official\nrecords show that within one year about one million foreigners came into\nthe United States. Notwithstanding this number, practically none went\ninto the Southern states; to be more exact, the records show that in\n1892 only 2278 all told went into the states of Alabama, Arkansas,\nGeorgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina,\nTennessee, and Virginia. One ship sometimes brings as many to New York.\nVarious reasons are given to explain why these foreigners systematically\navoid the South. One is that the climate is so hot; and another is that\nthey do not like the restrictions thrown about the ballot; and still\nanother is the presence of the Negro is so large numbers. Whatever the\ntrue reason is, the fact remains that foreigners avoid the South, and\nthe South is more and more realizing that it cannot keep pace with the\nprogress being made in other parts of the country if a third of its\npopulation is ignorant and without skill.\n\nThe South must frankly face this truth, that for a long period it must\ndepend upon the black man to do for it what the foreigner is now doing\nfor the great West. If, by reason of his skill and knowledge, one man in\nIowa learns to produce as much corn in a season as four men can produce\nin Alabama, it requires little reasoning to see that Alabama will buy\nmost of her corn from Iowa.\n\nAnother interesting result of the introduction of industrial education\nfor the Negro has been its influence upon the white people of the South,\nand, I believe, upon the whites of the North as well. This phase of it\nhas proved of interest in making hand training a conciliatory element\nbetween the races.\n\nIn 1883 I was delivering an address on industrial education before the\ncolored State Teachers' Association of one of our Southern states.\nWhen I had finished, some of the teachers began to ask the State\nSuperintendent of Education, who was on the programme, some questions\nabout the subject. He politely but firmly stopped the questions by\nstating that he knew absolutely nothing about industrial training, and\nhad never heard it discussed before. At that time there was no such\neducation being given at any white institution in that state. With one\nor two exceptions this case will illustrate what was true of all the\nSouthern states. A careful investigation of the subject will show\nthat it was not until after industrial education was started among\nthe colored people, and its value proved, that it was taken up by the\nSouthern white people.\n\nManual training or industrial and technical schools for the whites have,\nfor the most part, been established under state auspices, and are at\nthis time chiefly maintained by the states. An investigation would also\nshow that in securing money from the state legislatures for the purpose\nof introducing hand work, one of the main arguments used was the\nexistence and success of industrial training among the Negroes. It was\noften argued that the white boys and girls would be left behind unless\nthey had the opportunities for securing the same kind of training\nthat was being given the colored people. Although it is, I think, not\ngenerally known, it is a fact that since the idea of industrial or\ntechnical education for white people took root within the last few\nyears, much more money is spent annually for such education for the\nwhites than for the colored people. Any one who has not looked into the\nsubject will be surprised to find how thorough and high grade the work\nis. Take, for example, the state of Georgia, and it will be found that\nseveral times as much is being spent at the Industrial College for\nwhite girls at Milledgeville, and at the technical school for whites\nat Atlanta, as is being spent in the whole state for the industrial\neducation of Negro youths. I have met no Southern white educators who\nhave not been generous in their praise of the Negro schools for taking\nthe initiative in hand training. This fact has again served to create in\nmatters relating to education a bond of sympathy between the two races\nin the South. Referring again to the influence of industrial training\nfor the Negro in education, in the Northern states I find, while writing\nthis article, the following announcement in the advertisement of what\nis perhaps the most high-priced and exclusive girls' seminary in\nMassachusetts:--\n\n\"In planning a system of education for young ladies, with the view of\nfitting them for the greatest usefulness in life, the idea was conceived\nof supplementing the purely intellectual work by a practical training in\nthe art of home management and its related subjects.\n\n\"It was the first school of high literary grade to introduce courses in\nDomestic Science into the regular curriculum.\n\n\"The results were so gratifying as to lead to the equipment of\nExperiment Hall, a special building, fitted for the purpose of studying\nthe principles of Applied Housekeeping. Here the girls do the actual\nwork of cooking, marketing, arranging menus, and attend to all the\naffairs of a well-arranged household.\n\n\"Courses are arranged also in sewing, dressmaking, and millinery; they\nare conducted on a similarly practical basis, and equip the student with\na thorough knowledge of the subject.\"\n\nA dozen years ago I do not believe that any such announcement would have\nbeen made.\n\nBeginning with the year 1877, the Negro in the South lost practically\nall political control; that is to say, as early as 1885 the Negro\nscarcely had any members of his race in the national Congress or\nstate legislatures, and long before this date had ceased to hold state\noffices. This was true, notwithstanding the protests and fervent oratory\nof such strong race leaders as Frederick Douglass, B. K. Bruce, John R.\nLynch, P. B. S. Pinchback, and John M. Langston, with a host of others.\nWhen Frederick Douglass, the greatest man that the race has produced,\ndied in 1895, it is safe to say that the Negro in the Southern states,\nwith here and there a few exceptions, had practically no political\ncontrol or political influence, except in sending delegates to national\nconventions, or in holding a few Federal positions by appointment. It\nbecame evident to many of the wise Negroes that the race would have to\ndepend for its success in the future less upon political agitations and\nthe opportunity of holding office, and more upon something more tangible\nand substantial. It was at this period in the Negro's development, when\nthe distance between the races was greatest, and the spirit and ambition\nof the colored people most depressed, that the idea of industrial or\nbusiness development was introduced and began to be made prominent. It\ndid not take the more level-headed members of the race long to see that\nwhile the Negro in the South was surrounded by many difficulties, there\nwas practically no line drawn and little race discrimination in the\nworld of commerce, banking, storekeeping, manufacturing, and the skilled\ntrades, and in agriculture, and that in this lay his great opportunity.\nThey understood that, while the whites might object to a Negro's being a\npostmaster, they would not object to his being the president of a\nbank, and in the latter occupation they would give him assistance and\nencouragement. The colored people were quick to see that while the negro\nwould not be invited as a rule to attend the white man's prayer-meeting,\nhe would be invited every time to attend the stockholders' meeting of\na business concern in which he had an interest and that he could buy\nproperty in practically any portion of the South where the white man\ncould buy it. The white citizens were all the more willing to encourage\nthe Negro in this economic or industrial development, because they saw\nthat the prosperity of the Negro meant also the prosperity of the white\nman. They saw, too, that when a Negro became the owner of a home and\nwas a taxpayer, having a regular trade or other occupation, he at once\nbecame a conservative and safe citizen and voter; one who would consider\nthe interests of his whole community before casting his ballot; and,\nfurther, one whose ballot could not be purchased.\n\nOne case in point is that of the twenty-eight teachers at our school\nin Tuskegee who applied for life-voting certificates under the new\nconstitution of Alabama, not one was refused registration; and if I may\nbe forgiven a personal reference, in my own case, the Board of Registers\nwere kind enough to send me a special request to the effect that they\nwished me not to fail to register as a life voter. I do not wish\nto convey the impression that all worthy colored people have been\nregistered in Alabama, because there have been many inexcusable and\nunlawful omissions; but, with few exceptions, the 2700 who have been\nregistered represent the best Negroes in the state.\n\nThough in some parts of the country he is now misunderstood, I believe\nthat the time is going to come when matters can be weighed soberly, and\nwhen the whole people are going to see that president Roosevelt is, and\nhas been from the first, in line with this policy,--that of encouraging\nthe colored people who by industry and economy have won their way into\nthe confidence and respect of their neighbors. Both before and since\nhe became President I have had many conversations with him, and at all\ntimes I have found him enthusiastic over the plan that I have described.\n\nThe growth of the race in industrial and business directions within the\nlast few years cannot perhaps be better illustrated than by the fact\nthat what is now the largest secular national organization among the\ncolored people is the National Negro Business League. This organization\nbrings together annually hundreds of men and women who have worked their\nway up from the bottom to the point where they are now in some cases\nbankers, merchants, manufacturers, planters, etc. The sight of this body\nof men and women would surprise a large part of American citizens who do\nnot really know the better side of the Negro's life.\n\nIt ought to be stated frankly here that at first, and for several\nyears after the introduction of industrial training at such educational\ncentres as Hampton and Tuskegee, there was opposition from colored\npeople, and from portions of those Northern white people engaged in\neducational and missionary work among the colored people in the South.\nMost of those who manifested such opposition were actuated by the\nhighest and most honest motives. From the first the rank and file of the\nblacks were quick to see the advantages of industrial training, as is\nshown by the fact that industrial schools have always been overcrowded.\nOpposition to industrial training was based largely on the old and\nnarrow ground that it was something that the Southern white people\nfavored, and therefore must be against the interests of the Negro.\nAgain, others opposed it because they feared that it meant the\nabandonment of all political privileges, and the higher or classical\neducation of the race. They feared that the final outcome would be the\nmaterialization of the Negro, and the smothering of his spiritual and\naesthetic nature. Others felt that industrial education had for its\nobject the limitation of the Negro's development, and the branding him\nfor all time as a special hand-working class.\n\nNow that enough time has elapsed for those who opposed it to see that\nit meant none of these things, opposition, except from a very few of\nthe colored people living in Boston and Washington, has ceased, and this\nsystem has the enthusiastic support of the Negroes and of most of the\nwhites who formerly opposed it. All are beginning to see that it was\nnever meant that ALL Negro youths should secure industrial education,\nany more than it is meant that ALL white youths should pass through\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or the Amherst Agricultural\nCollege, to the exclusion of such training as is given at Harvard, Yale,\nor Dartmouth; but that in a peculiar sense a large proportion of the\nNegro youths needed to have that education which would enable them to\nsecure an economic foundation, without which no people can succeed in\nany of the higher walks of life.\n\nIt is because of the fact that the Tuskegee Institute began at the\nbottom, with work in the soil, in wood, in iron, in leather, that it\nhas now developed to the point where it is able to furnish employment\nas teachers to twenty-eight Negro graduates of the best colleges in the\ncountry. This is about three times as many Negro college graduates as\nany other institution in the United States for the education of colored\npeople employs, the total number of officers and instructors at Tuskegee\nbeing about one hundred and ten.\n\nThose who once opposed this see now that while the Negro youth who\nbecomes skilled in agriculture and a successful farmer may not be able\nhimself to pass through a purely literary college, he is laying the\nfoundation for his children and grandchildren to do it if desirable.\nIndustrial education in this generation is contributing in the highest\ndegree to make what is called higher education a success. It is now\nrealized that in so far as the race has intelligent and skillful\nproducers, the greater will be the success of the minister, lawyer,\ndoctor, and teacher. Opposition has melted away, too, because all men\nnow see that it will take a long time to \"materialize\" a race, millions\nof which hold neither houses nor railroads, nor bank stocks, nor\nfactories, nor coal and gold mines.\n\nAnother reason for the growth of a better understanding of the objects\nand influence of industrial training is the fact, as before stated, that\nit has been taken up with such interest and activity by the Southern\nwhites, and that it has been established at such universities as Cornell\nin the East, and in practically all of the state colleges of the great\nWest.\n\nIt is now seen that the result of such education will be to help the\nblack man to make for himself an independent place in our great American\nlife. It was largely the poverty of the Negro that made him the prey of\ndesigning politicians immediately after the war; and wherever poverty\nand lack of industry exist to-day, one does not find in him that deep\nspiritual life which the race must in the future possess in a higher\ndegree.\n\nTo those who still express the fear that perhaps too much stress is\nput upon industrial education for the Negro I would add that I should\nemphasize the same kind of training for any people, whether black or\nwhite, in the same stage of development as the masses of the colored\npeople.\n\nFor a number of years this country has looked to Germany for much in the\nway of education, and a large number of our brightest men and women are\nsent there each year. The official reports show that in Saxony, Germany,\nalone, there are 287 industrial schools, or one such school to every\n14,641 people. This is true of a people who have back of them centuries\nof wealth and culture. In the South I am safe in saying that there is\nnot more than one effective industrial school for every 400,000 colored\npeople.\n\nA recent dispatch from Germany says that the German Emperor has had a\nkitchen fitted up in the palace for the single purpose of having his\ndaughter taught cooking. If all classes and nationalities, who are\nin most cases thousands of years ahead of the Negro in the arts of\ncivilization, continue their interest in industrial training, I cannot\nunderstand how any reasonable person can object to such education for a\nlarge part of a people who are in the poverty-stricken condition that is\ntrue of a large element of my race, especially when such hand training\nis combined, as it should be, with the best education of head and heart.\n\n\n\n\nTHE NEGRO IN THE REGULAR ARMY by Oswald Garrison Villard\n\n\nWhen the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Regiment stormed Fort Wagner July\n18, 1863, only to be driven back with the loss of its colonel, Robert\nGould Shaw, and many of its rank and file, it established for all time\nthe fact that the colored soldier would fight and fight well. This had\nalready been demonstrated in Louisiana by colored regiments under the\ncommand of General Godfrey Weitzel in the attack upon Port Hudson on May\n27 of the same year. On that occasion regiments composed for the greater\npart of raw recruits, plantation hands with centuries of servitude under\nthe lash behind them, stormed trenches and dashed upon cold steel in the\nhands of their former masters and oppressors. After that there was no\nmore talk in the portion of the country of the \"natural cowardice\"\nof the negro. But the heroic qualities of Colonel Shaw, his social\nprominence and that of his officers, and the comparative nearness of\ntheir battlefield to the North, attracted greater and more lasting\nattention to the daring and bravery of their exploit, until it finally\nbecame fixed in many minds as the first real baptism of fire of colored\nAmerican soldiers.\n\nAfter Wagner the recruiting of colored regiments, originally opposed\nby both North and South, went on apace, particularly under the Federal\ngovernment, which organized no less than one hundred and fifty-four,\ndesignated as \"United States Colored Troops.\" Colonel Shaw's raising of\na colored regiment aroused quite as much comment in the North because\nof the race prejudice it defied, as because of the novelty of the new\norganization. General Weitzel tendered his resignation the instant\nGeneral B. F. Butler assigned black soldiers to his brigade, and was\nwith difficulty induced to serve on. His change of mind was a wise one,\nand not only because these colored soldiers covered him with glory at\nPort Hudson. It was his good fortune to be the central figure in one\nof the dramatic incidents of a war that must ever rank among the most\nthrilling and tragic the world has seen. The black cavalrymen who rode\ninto Richmond, the first of the Northern troops to enter the Southern\ncapital, went in waving their sabres and crying to the negroes on the\nsidewalks, \"We have come to set you free!\" They were from the division\nof Godfrey Weitzel, and American history has no more stirring moment.\n\nIn the South, notwithstanding the raising in 1861 of a colored\nConfederate regiment by Governor Moore of Louisiana (a magnificent body\nof educated colored men which afterwards became the First Louisiana\nNational Guards of General Weitzel's brigade and the first colored\nregiment in the Federal Army), the feeling against negro troops was\ninsurmountable until the last days of the struggle. Then no straw\ncould be overlooked. When, in December, 1863, Major-General Patrick R.\nCleburne, who commanded a division of Hardee's Corps of the Confederate\nArmy of the Tennessee, sent in a paper in which the employment of the\nslaves as soldiers of the South was vigorously advocated, Jefferson\nDavis indorsed it with the statement, \"I deem it inexpedient at\nthis time to give publicity to this paper, and request that it be\nsuppressed.\" General Cleburne urged that \"freedom within a reasonable\ntime\" be granted to every slave remaining true to the Confederacy, and\nwas moved to this action by the valor of the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts,\nsaying, \"If they [the negroes] can be made to face and fight bravely\nagainst their former masters, how much more probable is it that with\nthe allurement of a higher reward, and led by those masters, they would\nsubmit to discipline and face dangers?\"\n\nWith the ending of the civil war the regular army of the United States\nwas reorganized upon a peace footing by an act of Congress dated July\n28, 1866. In just recognition of the bravery of the colored volunteers\nsix regiments, the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry and the Thirty-eighth,\nThirty-ninth, Fortieth, and Forth-first Infantry, were designated\nas colored regiments. When the army was again reduced in 1869, the\nThirty-eighth and Forty-first became the Twenty-fourth Infantry, and\nthe Thirty-ninth and Fortieth became the Twenty-fifth. This left four\ncolored regiments in the regular army as it was constituted from 1870\nuntil 1901. There has never been a colored artillery organization in the\nregular service.\n\nTo these new regiments came a motley mixture of veterans of volunteer\norganizations, newly released slaves, and some freedmen of several\nyears' standing but without military experience. They were eager to\nlearn, and soon showed the same traits which distinguish the black\nregiments to-day,--loyalty to their officers and to their colors,\nsobriety and courage, and a notable pride in the efficiency of their\ncorps. But if ever officers had to \"father and mother\" their soldiers\nthey were the company officers of these regiments. The captains in\nparticular had to be bankers, secretaries, advisers, and judges for\ntheir men. As Lieutenant Grote Hutcheson has stated it, \"The men knew\nnothing, and the non-commissioned officers but little more. From the\nvery circumstances of their preceding life it could not be otherwise.\nThey had no independence, no self-reliance, not a thought except for\nthe present, and were filled with superstition.\" Yet the officers were\ndetermined to prove the wisdom of the experiment. To do this they were\nforced to give their own attention to the minutest details of military\nadministration, and to act as non-commissioned officers. The total lack\nof education among the men necessitated an enormous amount of writing by\nthe officers. In the Ninth Cavalry only one man was found able to write\nwell enough to be sergeant-major, and not for several years was it\npossible to obtain troop clerks. When the Tenth Cavalry was being\nrecruited an officer was sent to Philadelphia with the express purpose\nof picking up educated colored men for the non-commissioned positions.\nDifficult as the tasks of the officers thus were, most of them felt well\nrepaid for their unusual labors by the affectionate regard in which they\nwere held by their soldiers, and by the never-failing good humor with\nwhich the latter went about their duties.\n\nAs the years passed the character of the colored soldiers naturally\nchanged. In place of the war veterans, and of the men whose chains of\nservitude had just been struck off, came young men from the North and\nEast with more education and more self-reliance. They depended less\nupon their officers, both in the barracks and in the field, yet they\nreverenced and cared for them as much as did their predecessors. Their\ngreatest faults then as now were gambling and quarreling. On the other\nhand, the negro regiments speedily became favorably known because of\ngreater sobriety and of fewer desertions than among the white soldiers.\nIt was the Ninth Cavalry which a few years ago astonished the army by\nreporting not a single desertion in twelve months, an unheard-of and\nperhaps undreamed-of record. In all that goes to make a good soldier,\nin drill, fidelity, and smartness, the negro regular from the first took\nfront rank.\n\nNor was there ever any lack of the fighting quality which had gratified\nthe nation at Fort Wagner, or at Fort Blakely, Ala., where the\nSeventy-third Colored Infantry, under Colonel Henry C. Merriam, stormed\nthe enemy's works, in advance of orders, in one of the last actions of\nthe war. It soon fell to the lot of the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry to prove\nthat the negroes could do as well under fire in the Indian wars as they\nhad when fighting for the freedom of their race. While the Twenty-fourth\nand Twenty-fifth Infantry had merely garrison work to do, the Ninth and\nTenth Cavalry scouted for years against hostile Indians in Texas, New\nMexico, Colorado, and Kansas, always acquitting themselves honorably. In\nSeptember, 1868, a little over two years after their organization, three\ntroops of the Ninth Cavalry did well in an action against Indians\nat Horsehead Hills, Texas. When General George A. Forsyth and his\ndetachment of fifty scouts were surrounded and \"corralled\" by seven\nhundred Indians on an island in the Republican River, it was the troop\nof Captain Louis H. Carpenter, of the Tenth Cavalry, which first came to\ntheir rescue. Similarly when Major T. T. Thornburg's command was nearly\nwiped out by Utes in 1879, it was Captain F. S. Dodge's Troop D of the\nNinth which succeeded in reaching it in time, losing all its horses in\nso doing. This regiment alone took part in sixty Indian fights between\n1868 and 1890, during which time it lost three officers and twenty-seven\nmen killed, and had three officers and thirty-four men wounded. The\nTenth Cavalry's casualties were also heavy during this same period, and\nit fought for many years over a most difficult country in New Mexico and\nArizona, taking a conspicuous part in running to earth Geronimo's and\nVictoria's bands of Apaches.\n\nOn one of these campaigns Lieutenant Powhatan H. Clarke gave effective\nproof of the affection which the officers of colored regiments have\nfor their men. In the fight in the Pineto Mountains with a portion\nof Geronimo's forces this young Southerner risked his life to save a\ncolored sergeant who had fallen wounded in an open space where both he\nand his rescuer were easy marks for the Apaches. For this gallant act\nLieutenant Clarke rightly received a medal of honor. The Twenty-fourth\nInfantry, on the other hand, has contributed a striking instance of the\ndevotion of colored soldiers to their officers. When Major Joseph W.\nWham, paymaster, was attacked by robbers on May 11, 1889, his colored\nescort fought with such gallantry that every one of the soldiers was\nawarded a medal of honor or a certificate of merit. Some of them stood\ntheir ground although badly wounded, notably Sergeant Benjamin Brown,\nwho continued to fight and to encourage his men until shot through both\narms. In a fight against Apaches in the Cuchilo Negro Mountains of New\nMexico on August 16, 1881, Moses Williams, First Sergeant of Troop I,\nNinth Cavalry, displayed such gallantry that he was given a medal of\nhonor by common consent. When the only officer with the detachment,\nLieutenant Gustavus Valois, had his horse shot under him, and was cut\noff from his men, Sergeant Williams promptly rallied the detachment, and\nconducted the right flank in a running fight for several hours with such\ncoolness, bravery, and unflinching devotion to duty that he undoubtedly\nsaved the lives of at least three comrades. His action in standing by\nand rescuing Lieutenant Valois was the more noteworthy because he and\nhis men were subjected, in an exposed position, to a heavy fire from a\nlarge number of Indians. For splendid gallantry against Indians, while\nserving as sergeant of Troop K, Ninth Cavalry, on May 14, 1880, and\nAugust 12, 1881, George Jordan was also given a medal of honor. Five of\nthe medal of honor men now in the service are colored soldiers, while\nfifteen others have \"certificates of merit\" also awarded for conspicuous\ndeeds of bravery.\n\nIt was not until the battle of Santiago, however, that the bulk of the\nAmerican people realized that the standing army comprised regiments\ncomposed wholly of black men. Up to that time only one company of\ncolored soldiers had served at a post east of the Mississippi. Even\nMajor, later Brigadier-General, Guy V. Henry's gallop to the rescue of\nthe Seventh Cavalry on December 30, 1890, with four troops of the\nNinth Cavalry, attracted but little attention. This feat was the more\nremarkable because Major Henry's command had just completed a march of\nmore than one hundred miles in twenty-four hours. But in the battle\nat Santiago, the four colored regiments won praise from all sides,\nparticularly for their advance upon Kettle Hill, in which the Rough\nRiders also figured. From the very beginning of the movement of the army\nafter its landing, the negro troops were in the front of the fighting,\nand contributed largely to the successful result. Although they suffered\nheavy losses, especially in officers, the men fought with the same\ngallantry they had displayed on the plains, as is attested by the honors\nawarded. In every company there were instances of personal gallantry.\nThe first sergeants especially lived up to the responsibilities placed\nupon them. The color sergeant of the Tenth Cavalry, Adam Houston, bore\nto the front not only his own flags, but those of the Third Cavalry when\nthe latter's color sergeant was shot down. In several emergencies where\ntroops or companies lost their white officers, the senior sergeants\ntook command and handled their men in a faultless manner, notably in the\nTenth Cavalry.\n\nIndeed, the conduct of these men has done much to dispel the old belief\nthat colored soldiers will fight only when they have efficient white\nofficers. This may well have been true at one period of the civil war\nwhen the colored race as a whole had never even had the responsibilities\nattaching to free men. It is growing less and less true as time passes\nand better educated men enter the ranks. In recognition of their\nachievements at Santiago a number of these black non-commissioned\nofficers were made commissioned officers in several of the so-called\n\"immune\" regiments of United States Volunteers raised in July, 1898.\nNone of these organizations were in service long enough to become really\nefficient, and a few were never properly disciplined. Nevertheless,\na majority of the officers promoted from the colored regulars bore\nthemselves well under exceedingly trying circumstances. Some of them,\nand a number of regular sergeants and corporals who had succeeded\nto their former places, were made lieutenants and captains in the\nForty-eighth and Forty-ninth Volunteer Infantry, which served in the\nPhilippines for two years, and to which we shall recur later.\n\nAt Santiago the characteristic cheerfulness of the negro soldiers was\nas striking as their bravery. In his little book called The Nth Foot In\nWar, Lieutenant M. B. Stewart says of them:--\n\n\"The negro troops were in a high good humor. They had made the charge of\nthe day; they had fought with a dash and vigor which forever established\ntheir reputation as fighters, and which would carry them down in the\npages of history. To have heard them that night no one would have ever\nthought that they had lived for twelve mortal hours under a galling\nfire. They were laughing and joking over the events of the day, in the\nsame manner they would have done had they been returning from a picnic.\n\n\"'Golly,' laughed a six-foot sergeant, 'dere was music in de air sho'\nnuff. Dat lead was flying around in sheets, I tell you. I seen a buzzard\nflying around in front of our line, and I says to myself, \"Buzzard, you\nis in a mighty dangerous position. You better git out uf dat, 'cause dey\nain't room out dar for a muskeeter.\"' Another remarked, 'Say, did you\nsee dat man Brown; pity dat man been killed. He'd a been a corporal,\nsho.'\n\n\"In the utter exhaustion of the moment all race and social distinctions\nwere forgotten. Officers lay down among their men and slept like logs.\nThe negro troops sought out soft places along the sides of the road and\nlay down with their white comrades. There was a little commotion among\nthe latter, and an officer was heard to yell: 'Here, you man, take your\nfeet off my stomach. Well, I'll be damned if it ain't a nigger. Get out,\nyou black rascal.' As the commotion subsided, the negro was heard to\nremark, 'Well, if dat ain't de mos' particler man I ever see.'\"\n\nCharacteristic also is a story of the negro cavalryman who, returning\nto the rear, said to some troops anxious to get to the front: \"Dat's all\nright, gemmen; don't git in a sweat; dere's lots of it lef' for you.\nYou wants to look out for dese yere sharpshooters, for dey is mighty\ncareless with dere weapons, and dey is specially careless when dey is\nofficers aroun'.\"\n\nAs soon as the army settled down in the trenches before Santiago,\nsmuggled musical instruments--guitars, banjos, mouth organs, and what\nnot--appeared among the negro troops as if by magic, and they were\never in use. It was at once a scene of cheerfulness and gayety, and the\nofficers had their usual trouble in making the men go to sleep instead\nof spending the night in talking, singing, and gaming. In the peaceful\ncamp of the Third Alabama, in that state, the scenes were similar. There\nwas always \"a steady hum of laughter and talk, dance, song, shout, and\nthe twang of musical instruments.\" It was \"a scene full of life and\nfun, of jostling, scuffling, and racing, of clown performances and\ncake-walks, of impromptu minstrelsy, speech-making, and preaching, of\ndeviling, guying, and fighting, both real and mimic.\" The colonel found\ngreat difficulty in getting men to work alone. Two would volunteer for\nany service. \"Colonel,\" said a visitor to the camp, \"your sentinels are\nsociable fellows. I saw No. 5 over at the end of his beat entertaining\nNo. 6 with some fancy manual of arms. Afterwards, with equal amiability,\nNo. 6 executed a most artistic cake-walk for his friend.\" It must be\nremembered here that this colonel's men were typical Southern negroes,\nliterate and illiterate, and all new to military life.\n\nIn addition to the Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Volunteers, the four\nregular colored regiments have served in the Philippines. Here the work\nwas particularly trying and the temptations to misconduct many. The\nFilipino women were especially attractive to the men because of their\ncolor, and it is on record that several soldiers were tempted from their\nallegiance to the United States. Two of these, whose sympathy and liking\nfor the Filipinos overcame their judgment, paid the full penalty of\ndesertion, being hanged by their former comrades. Both belonged to\nthe Ninth Cavalry. On the other hand, in a remarkable order issued\nby General A. S. Burt in relinquishing command of the Twenty-fifth\nInfantry, on April 17, 1902, on his promotion to brigadier-general,\nhe was able to quote the Inspector-General of the army as saying:\n\"The Twenty-fifth Infantry is the best regiment I have seen in the\nPhilippines.\" General Burt praised highly the excellent conduct of the\nenlisted men while in the Archipelago, which proved to his mind that the\nAmerican negroes are \"as law-abiding as any race in the world.\"\n\nThree of General Burt's sergeants, Russell, McBryar, and Hoffman, were\npromoted to the Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Volunteers, and served,\nas lieutenants, for several months with their old regiment, the\nTwenty-fifth, until the arrival of their new regiments in Manila.\nDuring this time they were frequently under fire. General Burt bore high\ntestimony to their soldierly bearing, their capacity and ability, and\nexpressed great regret when he was forced to let them go. McBryar had\nwon a medal of honor for gallantry against Indians in Arizona in 1890.\nIn the Forty-ninth Volunteers, Company L, composed wholly of colored\nmen, and commanded by Captain Edward L. Baker, a colored veteran of\nSantiago, who had served for seventeen years in the Ninth and Tenth\nCavalry and in the Tenth \"Immunes,\" made a wonderful record. According\nto a statement which was widely published at the time and never denied,\nthis company had on its rolls during a period of twelve months one\nhundred and six men who were fit for duty at all times and never lost\na day on account of sickness. No white company remotely approached\nthis record. More extraordinary still is the fact that during this same\nperiod not one of these men ever went before a court-martial. This is\nsurely a striking illustration of what can be done by colored officers.\nIt is noticeable, too, that neither the officers nor the men of any\ncolored regiment have figured in the charges and counter-charges arising\nout of the use of the water-torture, except one man who at the time of\nhis offense was not with his regiment. The Forty-ninth Volunteers was\na very unhappy regiment during its brief life, but its troubles were\nlargely due to its white officers. One of these, a major, was dismissed\nfor misconduct, and his place was filled by the senior captain, a\ncolored man. Several other white officers and one colored captain got\ninto serious trouble, the last being dismissed. The Forty-eighth was,\non the contrary, a contented organization in which the colored officers\nwere treated in a kindly and courteous manner by their white associates\nand superiors. The two regiments afford a striking illustration of\nNapoleon's saying, \"There are no such things as poor regiments,--only\npoor colonels.\"\n\nThe negro regiment unquestionably calls for different treatment from\nthat which would be accorded to white troops, just as the Indian troops\nof King Edward's army require different handling from that called for\nin the case of the King's Royal Rifles. Yet as fighting machines,\nthe Indian soldiers may be the equals if not the superiors of the\nEnglishmen. Major Robert L. Bullard, Twenty-eighth United States\nInfantry who commanded the colored Third Alabama Volunteers, already\nreferred to, during the war with Spain, discusses in a remarkable paper\npublished in the United Service Magazine for July, 1901, the differences\nbetween negro and white soldiers. They are so great, he says, as\nto require the military commander to treat the negro as a different\nspecies. He must fit his methods of instruction and discipline to\nthe characteristics of the race. Major Bullard adds that \"mistakes,\ninjustices, and failures would result from his making the same rules and\nmethods apply to the two races without regard to how far apart set\nby nature or separated by evolution.\" But Major Bullard would\nunquestionably concede that these differences in no way require a\ntreatment of the negro soldier which implies that he is an inferior\nbeing and which ever impresses upon him his inferiority. Yet this seems\nto have been the case in the Forty-ninth United States Volunteers.\n\nIn the regular army, as well as in the volunteers, officers have\nfrequently appealed with success to the negroes' pride of race, and have\nurged them on to greater efficiency and better behavior by reminding\nthem that they have the honor of their people in their hands. To such\nappeals there is ever a prompt response. One of the most effective ways\nof disciplining an offender is by holding him up to the ridicule of his\nfellows. The desire of the colored soldiers to amuse and to be amused\ngives the officers an easy way of obtaining a hold upon them and their\naffections. The regimental rifle team, the baseball nine, the minstrel\ntroupe, and the regimental band offer positions of importance for which\nthe competition is much keener than in the white regiments. There\nis also a friendly rivalry between companies, which is much missed\nelsewhere in the service. The negroes are natural horsemen and riders.\nIt is a pleasure to them to take care of their mounts, and a matter of\npride to keep their animals in good condition. Personally they are clean\nand neat, and they take the greatest possible pride in their uniforms.\nIn no white regiment is there a similar feeling. With the negroes the\ncanteen question is of comparatively slight importance, not only because\nthe men can be more easily amused within their barracks, but because\ntheir appetite for drink is by no means as strong as that of the white\nmen. Their sociability is astonishing. They would rather sit up and tell\nstories and crack jokes than go to bed, no matter how hard the day has\nbeen.\n\nThe dark sides are, that the negro soldiers easily turn merited\npunishment into martyrdom, that their gambling propensities are almost\nbeyond control, that their habit of carrying concealed weapons is\nincurable, and that there is danger of serious fighting when they fall\nout with one another. Frequent failure to act honorably toward a comrade\nin some trifling matter is apt to cause scuffling and fighting until the\nmen are well disciplined. Women are another cause of quarrels, and are\nat all times a potent temptation to misconduct and neglect of duty.\nIt is very difficult to impress upon the men the value of government\nproperty, and duty which requires memorizing of orders is always the\nmost difficult to teach. For the study of guard duty manuals or of\ntactics they have no natural aptitude. The non-commissioned officers are\nof very great importance, and in the regulars they are looked up to and\nobeyed implicitly, much more so than is the case with white troops. It\nis necessary, however, for the officers to back up the sergeants and\ncorporals very vigorously, even when they are slightly in the wrong.\nThen colored men are more easily \"rattled\" by poor officers than are\ntheir white comrades. There was a striking instance of this two or three\nyears ago when a newly appointed and wholly untrained white officer lost\nhis head at a post in Texas. His black subordinates, largely recruits,\nfollowed suit, and in carrying out his hysterical orders imperiled\nmany lives in the neighboring town. Selections for service with colored\ntroops should therefore be most carefully made. Major Bullard declares\nthat the officer of negro troops \"must not only be an officer and\na gentleman, but he must be considerate, patient, laborious,\nself-sacrificing, a man of affairs, and he must have knowledge and\nwisdom in a great lot of things not really military.\"\n\nIf the position of a white officer is a difficult one, that of\nthe colored officer is still more so. He has not the self-assumed\nsuperiority of the white man, naturally feels that he is on trial, and\nmust worry himself incessantly about his relations to his white comrades\nof the shoulder straps. While the United States Navy has hitherto been\nclosed to negroes who aspire to be officers, the army has pursued a\nwiser and more just policy. The contrast between the two services is\nreally remarkable. On almost every war vessel white and black sailors\nsleep and live together in crowded quarters without protest or friction.\nBut the negro naval officer is kept out of the service by hook or by\ncrook for the avowed reason that the cramped quarters of the wardroom\nwould make association with him intolerable. In the army, on the other\nhand, the experiment of mixed regiments has never been tried. A good\ncolored soldier can nevertheless obtain a commission by going through\nWest Point, or by rising from the ranks, or by being appointed directly\nfrom civil life.\n\nSince the foundation of the Military Academy there have been eighteen\ncolored boys appointed to West Point, of whom fifteen failed in their\npreliminary examinations, or were discharged after entering because of\ndeficiency in studies. Three were graduated and commissioned as second\nlieutenants of cavalry, Henry Ossian Flipper, John Hanks Alexander, and\nCharles Young. Of these, Lieutenant Flipper was dismissed June 30,\n1882, for \"conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.\" The other\ntwo proved themselves excellent officers, notably Young, who is at this\nwriting a captain, and a most efficient one, in the Ninth Cavalry, with\nwhich he recently served in the Philippines. Lieutenant Alexander died\nsuddenly in 1894. In announcing his death in a regimental order his\ncolonel spoke of him in terms of high praise, and did not use the\ncustomary stereotyped phrases of regret. His fellow white officers all\nhad good words for him. There never was more striking testimony to the\ndiscipline and spirit of fairness at West Point than was afforded by the\nsight of Cadet Charles Young, who is of very dark complexion, commanding\nwhite cadets. Nothing else has impressed foreign visitors at West Point\nhalf so much.\n\nAn equally remarkable happening, and one which speaks even more for\nthe democratic spirit in the army, was the commissioning in 1901 of\nSergeant-Major Benjamin O. Davis, Ninth Cavalry, and of Corporal John E.\nGreen, Twenty-fourth Infantry. Both these men were examined by boards\nof white officers, who might easily have excluded them because of color\nprejudice, in which case there would have been no appeal from their\nfindings. Lieutenant Davis's former troop commander, a West Pointer,\nopenly rejoiced at his success, and predicted that he would make an\nexcellent officer. These are the first two colored men to rise from the\nranks, but there will be many more if the same admirable spirit of\nfair play continues to rule in the army and is not altered by outside\nprejudice. It was thought that there would be a severe strain upon\ndiscipline when a colored officer rose to the rank of captain and to\nthe command of white officers. But in Captain Young's case his white\nsubordinates seem to have realized that it is the position and rank\nthat they are compelled to salute and obey, and not the individual. This\nprinciple is at the bottom of all discipline. Only too frequently do\nsubordinates throughout the army have to remind themselves of this when\nobeying men for whose social qualities and character they have neither\nregard nor respect. During the war with Spain Captain Young commanded\na negro battalion from Ohio, which was pronounced the best drilled\norganization in the large army assembled at Camp Alger near Washington.\nIn addition to these officers, Captain John R. Lynch, formerly a\nCongressman from Mississippi, and four colored chaplains represent their\nrace on the commissioned rolls of the army. All of these men are doing\nwell. One colored chaplain was dismissed for drunkenness in 1894. Beyond\nthis their record is unblemished.\n\nDespite the fairness shown in these appointments, there has been\nconsiderable very just criticism of the War Department for its failure\nto appoint to the regulars any of the colored officers who did well in\nthe Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Volunteers. Every colonel of volunteers\nwas allowed to designate for examination for appointment to the regular\narmy the best officers in his regiment. Hundreds of white officers were\nselected in this way, but not a single colored officer was given an\nexamination,--not even Lieutenant McBryar, with his medal of honor,\nor Captain Baker. Similarly fault has been found with Secretary Root\nbecause no new colored regiments were established under the law of\nFebruary 2, 1901, increasing the army by five regiments of infantry,\nfive of cavalry, and a large number of companies of artillery. The\nexcuse most often heard is that the negroes already have sufficient\nrepresentation in comparison with the percentage of negroes to white\npersons within the borders of the United States. But the sterling\ncharacteristics of the colored soldiers, their loyalty to the service\nas shown by the statistics of desertion, and, above all, their splendid\nservice in Cuba, should have entitled them to additional organizations.\nTo say the least, the decision of the War Department smacks considerably\nof ingratitude. Nevertheless, the negro regiments have come to stay,\nboth in the regulars and in the volunteers. The hostilities of the last\nfive years have dispelled any doubt which may have existed upon this\npoint.\n\n\n\n\nBAXTER'S PROCRUSTES by Charles W. Chesnutt\n\n\nBaxter's Procrustes is one of the publications of the Bodleian Club. The\nBodleian Club is composed of gentlemen of culture, who are interested\nin books and book-collecting. It was named, very obviously, after the\nfamous library of the same name, and not only became in our city a sort\nof shrine for local worshipers of fine bindings and rare editions,\nbut was visited occasionally by pilgrims from afar. The Bodleian\nhas entertained Mark Twain, Joseph Jefferson, and other literary and\nhistrionic celebrities. It possesses quite a collection of personal\nmementos of distinguished authors, among them a paperweight which once\nbelonged to Goethe, a lead pencil used by Emerson, an autograph letter\nof Matthew Arnold, and a chip from a tree felled by Mr. Gladstone. Its\nlibrary contains a number of rare books, including a fine collection on\nchess, of which game several of the members are enthusiastic devotees.\n\nThe activities of the club are not, however, confined entirely to books.\nWe have a very handsome clubhouse, and much taste and discrimination\nhave been exercised in its adornment. There are many good paintings,\nincluding portraits of the various presidents of the club, which adorn\nthe entrance hall. After books, perhaps the most distinctive feature\nof the club is our collection of pipes. In a large rack in the\nsmoking-room--really a superfluity, since smoking is permitted all over\nthe house--is as complete an assortment of pipes as perhaps exists in\nthe civilized world. Indeed, it is an unwritten rule of the club that no\none is eligible for membership who cannot produce a new variety of pipe,\nwhich is filed with his application for membership, and, if he passes,\ndeposited with the club collection, he, however, retaining the title in\nhimself. Once a year, upon the anniversary of the death of Sir Walter\nRaleigh, who it will be remembered, first introduced tobacco into\nEngland, the full membership of the club, as a rule, turns out. A large\nsupply of the very best smoking mixture is laid in. At nine o'clock\nsharp each member takes his pipe from the rack, fills it with tobacco,\nand then the whole club, with the president at the head, all smoking\nfuriously, march in solemn procession from room to room, upstairs\nand downstairs, making the tour of the clubhouse and returning to the\nsmoking-room. The president then delivers an address, and each member\nis called upon to say something, either by way of a quotation or\nan original sentiment, in praise of the virtues of nicotine. This\nceremony--facetiously known as \"hitting the pipe\"--being thus concluded,\nthe membership pipes are carefully cleaned out and replaced in the club\nrack.\n\nAs I have said, however, the raison d'etre of the club, and the feature\nupon which its fame chiefly rests, is its collection of rare books, and\nof these by far the most interesting are its own publications. Even its\ncatalogues are works of art, published in numbered editions, and sought\nby libraries and book-collectors. Early in its history it began\nthe occasional publication of books which should meet the club\nstandard,--books in which emphasis should be laid upon the qualities\nthat make a book valuable in the eyes of collectors. Of these, age\ncould not, of course, be imparted, but in the matter of fine and curious\nbindings, of hand-made linen papers, of uncut or deckle edges, of\nwide margins and limited editions, the club could control its own\npublications. The matter of contents was, it must be confessed, a\nless important consideration. At first it was felt by the publishing\ncommittee that nothing but the finest products of the human mind should\nbe selected for enshrinement in the beautiful volumes which the\nclub should issue. The length of the work was an important\nconsideration,--long things were not compatible with wide margins and\ngraceful slenderness. For instance, we brought out Coleridge's Ancient\nMariner, an essay by Emerson, and another by Thoreau. Our Rubaiyat of\nOmar Khayyam was Heron-Allen's translation of the original MS in\nthe Bodleian Library at Oxford, which, though less poetical than\nFitzGerald's, was not so common. Several years ago we began to publish\nthe works of our own members. Bascom's Essay on Pipes was a very\ncreditable performance. It was published in a limited edition of one\nhundred copies, and since it had not previously appeared elsewhere and\nwas copyrighted by the club, it was sufficiently rare to be valuable\nfor that reason. The second publication of local origin was Baxter's\nProcrustes.\n\nI have omitted to say that once or twice a year, at a meeting of which\nnotice has been given, an auction is held at the Bodleian. The members\nof the club send in their duplicate copies, or books they for any reason\nwish to dispose of, which are auctioned off to the highest bidder. At\nthese sales, which are well attended, the club's publications have of\nrecent years formed the leading feature. Three years ago, number three\nof Bascom's Essay on Pipes sold for fifteen dollars;--the original\ncost of publication was one dollar and seventy-five cents. Later in the\nevening an uncut copy of the same brought thirty dollars. At the next\nauction the price of the cut copy was run up to twenty-five dollars,\nwhile the uncut copy was knocked down at seventy-five dollars. The club\nhad always appreciated the value of uncut copies, but this financial\nindorsement enhanced their desirability immensely. This rise in the\nEssay on Pipes was not without a sympathetic effect upon all the club\npublications. The Emerson essay rose from three dollars to seventeen,\nand the Thoreau, being by an author less widely read, and, by his own\nconfession commercially unsuccessful, brought a somewhat higher figure.\nThe prices, thus inflated, were not permitted to come down appreciably.\nSince every member of the club possessed one or more of these valuable\neditions, they were all manifestly interested in keeping up the price.\nThe publication, however, which brought the highest prices, and, but\nfor the sober second thought, might have wrecked the whole system, was\nBaxter's Procrustes.\n\nBaxter was, perhaps, the most scholarly member of the club. A graduate\nof Harvard, he had traveled extensively, had read widely, and while not\nso enthusiastic a collector as some of us, possessed as fine a private\nlibrary as any man of his age in the city. He was about thirty-five\nwhen he joined the club, and apparently some bitter experience--some\ndisappointment in love or ambition--had left its mark upon his\ncharacter. With light, curly hair, fair complexion, and gray eyes,\none would have expected Baxter to be genial of temper, with a tendency\ntoward wordiness of speech. But though he had occasional flashes of\nhumor, his ordinary demeanor was characterized by a mild cynicism,\nwhich, with his gloomy pessimistic philosophy, so foreign to the\ntemperament that should accompany his physical type, could only be\naccounted for upon the hypothesis of some secret sorrow such as I\nhave suggested. What it might be no one knew. He had means and social\nposition, and was an uncommonly handsome man. The fact that he remained\nunmarried at thirty-five furnished some support for the theory of a\ndisappointment in love, though this the several intimates of Baxter who\nbelonged to the club were not able to verify.\n\nIt had occurred to me, in a vague way, that perhaps Baxter might be\nan unsuccessful author. That he was a poet we knew very well, and\ntypewritten copies of his verses had occasionally circulated among us.\nBut Baxter had always expressed such a profound contempt for modern\nliterature, had always spoken in terms of such unmeasured pity for\nthe slaves of the pen, who were dependent upon the whim of an\nundiscriminating public for recognition and a livelihood, that no one of\nus had ever suspected him of aspirations toward publication, until, as I\nhave said, it occurred to me one day that Baxter's attitude with regard\nto publication might be viewed in the light of effect as well as of\ncause--that his scorn of publicity might as easily arise from failure\nto achieve it, as his never having published might be due to his\npreconceived disdain of the vulgar popularity which one must share with\nthe pugilist or balloonist of the hour.\n\nThe notion of publishing Baxter's Procrustes did not emanate from\nBaxter,--I must do him the justice to say this. But he had spoken to\nseveral of the fellows about the theme of his poem, until the notion\nthat Baxter was at work upon something fine had become pretty well\ndisseminated throughout our membership. He would occasionally read\nbrief passages to a small coterie of friends in the sitting-room or\nlibrary,--never more than ten lines at once, or to more than five people\nat a time,--and these excerpts gave at least a few of us a pretty fair\nidea of the motive and scope of the poem. As I, for one, gathered,\nit was quite along the line of Baxter's philosophy. Society was the\nProcrustes which, like the Greek bandit of old, caught every man born\ninto the world, and endeavored to fit him to some preconceived standard,\ngenerally to the one for which he was least adapted. The world was full\nof men and women who were merely square pegs in round holes, and vice\nversa. Most marriages were unhappy because the contracting parties were\nnot properly mated. Religion was mostly superstition, science for the\nmost part sciolism, popular education merely a means of forcing the\nstupid and repressing the bright, so that all the youth of the rising\ngeneration might conform to the same dull, dead level of democratic\nmediocrity. Life would soon become so monotonously uniform and so\nuniformly monotonous as to be scarce worth the living.\n\nIt was Smith, I think, who first proposed that the club publish Baxter's\nProcrustes. The poet himself did not seem enthusiastic when the subject\nwas broached; he demurred for some little time, protesting that the poem\nwas not worthy of publication. But when it was proposed that the edition\nbe limited to fifty copies he agreed to consider the proposition. When\nI suggested, having in mind my secret theory of Baxter's failure in\nauthorship, that the edition would at least be in the hands of friends,\nthat it would be difficult for a hostile critic to secure a copy, and\nthat if it should not achieve success from a literary point of view,\nthe extent of the failure would be limited to the size of the edition,\nBaxter was visibly impressed. When the literary committee at length\ndecided to request formally of Baxter the privilege of publishing his\nProcrustes, he consented, with evident reluctance, upon condition that\nhe should supervise the printing, binding, and delivery of the books,\nmerely submitting to the committee, in advance, the manuscript, and\ntaking their views in regard to the bookmaking.\n\nThe manuscript was duly presented to the literary committee. Baxter\nhaving expressed the desire that the poem be not read aloud at a meeting\nof the club, as was the custom, since he wished it to be given to the\nworld clad in suitable garb, the committee went even farther. Having\nentire confidence in Baxter's taste and scholarship, they, with great\ndelicacy, refrained from even reading the manuscript, contenting\nthemselves with Baxter's statement of the general theme and the topics\ngrouped under it. The details of the bookmaking, however, were gone into\nthoroughly. The paper was to be of hand-made linen, from the Kelmscott\nMills; the type black-letter, with rubricated initials. The cover, which\nwas Baxter's own selection, was to be of dark green morocco, with a\ncap-and-bells border in red inlays, and doublures of maroon morocco\nwith a blind-tooled design. Baxter was authorized to contract with the\nprinter and superintend the publication. The whole edition of fifty\nnumbered copies was to be disposed of at auction, in advance, to the\nhighest bidder, only one copy to each, the proceeds to be devoted to\npaying for the printing and binding, the remainder, if any, to go into\nthe club treasury, and Baxter himself to receive one copy by way of\nremuneration. Baxter was inclined to protest at this, on the ground that\nhis copy would probably be worth more than the royalties on the edition,\nat the usual ten per cent, would amount to, but was finally prevailed\nupon to accept an author's copy.\n\nWhile the Procrustes was under consideration, some one read, at one of\nour meetings, a note from some magazine, which stated that a sealed copy\nof a new translation of Campanella's Sonnets, published by the Grolier\nClub, had been sold for three hundred dollars. This impressed the\nmembers greatly. It was a novel idea. A new work might thus be enshrined\nin a sort of holy of holies, which, if the collector so desired, could\nbe forever sacred from the profanation of any vulgar or unappreciative\neye. The possessor of such a treasure could enjoy it by the eye of\nimagination, having at the same time the exaltation of grasping what was\nfor others the unattainable. The literary committee were so impressed\nwith this idea that they presented it to Baxter in regard to the\nProcrustes. Baxter making no objection, the subscribers who might wish\ntheir copies delivered sealed were directed to notify the author. I sent\nin my name. A fine book, after all, was an investment, and if there was\nany way of enhancing its rarity, and therefore its value, I was quite\nwilling to enjoy such an advantage.\n\nWhen the Procrustes was ready for distribution, each subscriber received\nhis copy by mail, in a neat pasteboard box. Each number was wrapped in\na thin and transparent but very strong paper through which the cover\ndesign and tooling were clearly visible. The number of the copy was\nindorsed upon the wrapper, the folds of which were securely fastened at\neach end with sealing-wax, upon which was impressed, as a guaranty of\nits inviolateness, the monogram of the club.\n\nAt the next meeting of the Bodleian, a great deal was said about the\nProcrustes, and it was unanimously agreed that no finer specimen\nof bookmaking had ever been published by the club. By a curious\ncoincidence, no one had brought his copy with him, and the two club\ncopies had not yet been received from the binder, who, Baxter had\nreported was retaining them for some extra fine work. Upon resolution,\noffered by a member who had not subscribed for the volume, a committee\nof three was appointed to review the Procrustes at the next literary\nmeeting of the club. Of this committee it was my doubtful fortune to\nconstitute one.\n\nIn pursuance of my duty in the premises, it of course became necessary\nfor me to read the Procrustes. In all probability I should have cut my\nown copy for this purpose, had not one of the club auctions intervened\nbetween my appointment and the date set for the discussion of the\nProcrustes. At this meeting a copy of the book, still sealed, was\noffered for sale, and bought by a non-subscriber for the unprecedented\nprice of one hundred and fifty dollars. After this a proper regard for\nmy own interests would not permit me to spoil my copy by opening it, and\nI was therefore compelled to procure my information concerning the poem\nfrom some other source. As I had no desire to appear mercenary, I\nsaid nothing about my own copy, and made no attempt to borrow. I did,\nhowever, casually remark to Baxter that I should like to look at\nhis copy of the proof sheets, since I wished to make some extended\nquotations for my review, and would rather not trust my copy to a typist\nfor that purpose. Baxter assured me, with every evidence of regret, that\nhe had considered them of so little importance that he had thrown them\ninto the fire. This indifference of Baxter to literary values struck\nme as just a little overdone. The proof sheets of Hamlet, corrected in\nShakespeare's own hand, would be well-nigh priceless.\n\nAt the next meeting of the club I observed that Thompson and Davis,\nwho were with me on the reviewing committee, very soon brought up the\nquestion of the Procrustes in conversation in the smoking-room, and\nseemed anxious to get from the members their views concerning Baxter's\nproduction, I supposed upon the theory that the appreciation of any book\nreview would depend more or less upon the degree to which it reflected\nthe opinion of those to whom the review should be presented. I presumed,\nof course, that Thompson and Davis had each read the book,--they were\namong the subscribers,--and I was desirous of getting their point of\nview.\n\n\"What do you think,\" I inquired, \"of the passage on Social Systems?\" I\nhave forgotten to say that the poem was in blank verse, and divided into\nparts, each with an appropriate title.\n\n\"Well,\" replied Davis, it seemed to me a little cautiously, \"it is not\nexactly Spencerian, although it squints at the Spencerian view, with a\nslight deflection toward Hegelianism. I should consider it an harmonious\nfusion of the best views of all the modern philosophers, with a strong\nBaxterian flavor.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Thompson, \"the charm of the chapter lies in this very\nquality. The style is an emanation from Baxter's own intellect,--he\nhas written himself into the poem. By knowing Baxter we are able to\nappreciate the book, and after having read the book we feel that we are\nso much the more intimately acquainted with Baxter,--the real Baxter.\"\n\nBaxter had come in during this colloquy, and was standing by the\nfireplace smoking a pipe. I was not exactly sure whether the faint\nsmile which marked his face was a token of pleasure or cynicism; it was\nBaxterian, however, and I had already learned that Baxter's opinions\nupon any subject were not to be gathered always from his facial\nexpression. For instance, when the club porter's crippled child died\nBaxter remarked, it seemed to me unfeelingly, that the poor little devil\nwas doubtless better off, and that the porter himself had certainly\nbeen relieved of a burden; and only a week later the porter told me in\nconfidence that Baxter had paid for an expensive operation, undertaken\nin the hope of prolonging the child's life. I therefore drew no\nconclusions from Baxter's somewhat enigmatical smile. He left the room\nat this point in the conversation, somewhat to my relief.\n\n\"By the way, Jones,\" said Davis, addressing me, \"are you impressed by\nBaxter's views on Degeneration?\"\n\nHaving often heard Baxter express himself upon the general downward\ntendency of modern civilization, I felt safe in discussing his views in\na broad and general manner.\n\n\"I think,\" I replied, \"that they are in harmony with those of\nSchopenhauer, without his bitterness; with those of Nordau, without his\nflippancy. His materialism is Haeckel's, presented with something of the\ncharm of Omar Khayyam.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" chimed in Davis, \"it answers the strenuous demand of our\nday,--dissatisfaction with an unjustified optimism,--and voices for us\nthe courage of human philosophy facing the unknown.\"\n\nI had a vague recollection of having read something like this somewhere,\nbut so much has been written, that one can scarcely discuss any subject\nof importance without unconsciously borrowing, now and then, the\nthoughts or the language of others. Quotation, like imitation, is a\nsuperior grade of flattery.\n\n\"The Procrustes,\" said Thompson, to whom the metrical review had been\napportioned, \"is couched in sonorous lines, of haunting melody and\ncharm; and yet so closely inter-related as to be scarcely quotable with\njustice to the author. To be appreciated the poem should be read as\na whole,--I shall say as much in my review. What shall you say of the\nletter-press?\" he concluded, addressing me. I was supposed to discuss\nthe technical excellence of the volume from the connoisseur's viewpoint.\n\n\"The setting,\" I replied judicially, \"is worthy of the gem. The dark\ngreen cover, elaborately tooled, the old English lettering, the heavy\nlinen paper, mark this as one of our very choicest publications. The\nletter-press is of course De Vinne's best,--there is nothing better\non this side of the Atlantic. The text is a beautiful, slender stream,\nmeandering gracefully through a wide meadow of margin.\"\n\nFor some reason I left the room for a minute. As I stepped into the\nhall, I almost ran into Baxter, who was standing near the door, facing a\nhunting print of a somewhat humorous character, hung upon the wall, and\nsmiling with an immensely pleased expression.\n\n\"What a ridiculous scene!\" he remarked. \"Look at that fat old squire on\nthat tall hunter! I'll wager dollars to doughnuts that he won't get over\nthe first fence!\"\n\nIt was a very good bluff, but did not deceive me. Under his mask of\nunconcern, Baxter was anxious to learn what we thought of his poem, and\nhad stationed himself in the hall that he might overhear our discussion\nwithout embarrassing us by his presence. He had covered up his delight\nat our appreciation by this simulated interest in the hunting print.\n\n\nWhen the night came for the review of the Procrustes there was a large\nattendance of members, and several visitors, among them a young English\ncousin of one of the members, on his first visit to the United States;\nsome of us had met him at other clubs, and in society, and had found\nhim a very jolly boy, with a youthful exuberance of spirits and a naive\nignorance of things American that made his views refreshing and, at\ntimes, amusing.\n\nThe critical essays were well considered, if a trifle vague. Baxter\nreceived credit for poetic skill of a high order.\n\n\"Our brother Baxter,\" said Thompson, \"should no longer bury his talent\nin a napkin. This gem, of course, belongs to the club, but the same\nbrain from which issued this exquisite emanation can produce others to\ninspire and charm an appreciative world.\"\n\n\"The author's view of life,\" said Davis, \"as expressed in these\nbeautiful lines, will help us to fit our shoulders for the heavy\nburden of life, by bringing to our realization those profound truths\nof philosophy which find hope in despair and pleasure in pain. When he\nshall see fit to give to the wider world, in fuller form, the thoughts\nof which we have been vouchsafed this foretaste, let us hope that some\nlittle ray of his fame may rest upon the Bodleian, from which can never\nbe taken away the proud privilege of saying that he was one of its\nmembers.\"\n\nI then pointed out the beauties of the volume as a piece of bookmaking.\nI knew, from conversation with the publication committee, the style of\ntype and rubrication, and could see the cover through the wrapper of my\nsealed copy. The dark green morocco, I said, in summing up, typified the\nauthor's serious view of life, as a thing to be endured as patiently as\nmight be. The cap-and-bells border was significant of the shams by which\nthe optimist sought to delude himself into the view that life was a\ndesirable thing. The intricate blind-tooling of the doublure shadowed\nforth the blind fate which left us in ignorance of our future and our\npast, or of even what the day itself might bring forth. The black-letter\ntype, with rubricated initials, signified a philosophic pessimism\nenlightened by the conviction that in duty one might find, after all, an\nexcuse for life and a hope for humanity. Applying this test to the club,\nthis work, which might be said to represent all that the Bodleian stood\nfor, was in itself sufficient to justify the club's existence. If the\nBodleian had done nothing else, if it should do nothing more, it had\nproduced a masterpiece.\n\nThere was a sealed copy of the Procrustes, belonging, I believe, to one\nof the committee, lying on the table by which I stood, and I had picked\nit up and held it in my hand for a moment, to emphasize one of my\nperiods, but had laid it down immediately. I noted, as I sat down, that\nyoung Hunkin, our English visitor, who sat on the other side of the\ntable, had picked up the volume and was examining it with interest. When\nthe last review was read, and the generous applause had subsided, there\nwere cries for Baxter.\n\n\"Baxter! Baxter! Author! Author!\"\n\nBaxter had been sitting over in a corner during the reading of the\nreviews, and had succeeded remarkably well, it seemed to me, in\nconcealing, under his mask of cynical indifference, the exultation which\nI was sure he must feel. But this outburst of enthusiasm was too much\neven for Baxter, and it was clear that he was struggling with strong\nemotion when he rose to speak.\n\n\"Gentlemen, and fellow members of the Bodleian, it gives me unaffected\npleasure--sincere pleasure--some day you may know how much pleasure--I\ncannot trust myself to say it now--to see the evident care with which\nyour committee have read my poor verses, and the responsive sympathy\nwith which my friends have entered into my views of life and conduct.\nI thank you again, and again, and when I say that I am too full for\nutterance,--I'm sure you will excuse me from saying any more.\"\n\nBaxter took his seat, and the applause had begun again when it was\nbroken by a sudden exclamation.\n\n\"By Jove!\" exclaimed our English visitor, who still sat behind the\ntable, \"what an extraordinary book!\"\n\nEvery one gathered around him.\n\n\"You see,\" he exclaimed; holding up the volume, \"you fellows said so\nmuch about the bally book that I wanted to see what it was like; so I\nuntied the ribbon, and cut the leaves with the paper knife lying here,\nand found--and found that there wasn't a single line in it, don't you\nknow!\"\n\nBlank consternation followed this announcement, which proved only too\ntrue. Every one knew instinctively, without further investigation, that\nthe club had been badly sold. In the resulting confusion Baxter escaped,\nbut later was waited upon by a committee, to whom he made the rather\nlame excuse that he had always regarded uncut and sealed books as\ntommy-rot, and that he had merely been curious to see how far the thing\ncould go; and that the result had justified his belief that a book with\nnothing in it was just as useful to a book-collector as one embodying a\nwork of genius. He offered to pay all the bills for the sham Procrustes,\nor to replace the blank copies with the real thing, as we might choose.\nOf course, after such an insult, the club did not care for the poem. He\nwas permitted to pay the expense, however, and it was more than hinted\nto him that his resignation from the club would be favorably acted upon.\nHe never sent it in, and, as he went to Europe shortly afterwards, the\naffair had time to blow over.\n\nIn our first disgust at Baxter's duplicity, most of us cut our copies of\nthe Procrustes, some of us mailed them to Baxter with cutting notes, and\nothers threw them into the fire. A few wiser spirits held on to theirs,\nand this fact leaking out, it began to dawn upon the minds of the real\ncollectors among us that the volume was something unique in the way of a\npublication.\n\n\"Baxter,\" said our president one evening to a select few of us who\nsat around the fireplace, \"was wiser than we knew, or than he perhaps\nappreciated. His Procrustes, from the collector's point of view, is\nentirely logical, and might be considered as the acme of bookmaking. To\nthe true collector, a book is a work of art, of which the contents\nare no more important than the words of an opera. Fine binding is a\ndesideratum, and, for its cost, that of the Procrustes could not be\nimproved upon. The paper is above criticism. The true collector loves\nwide margins, and the Procrustes, being all margin, merely touches the\nvanishing point of the perspective. The smaller the edition, the greater\nthe collector's eagerness to acquire a copy. There are but six uncut\ncopies left, I am told, of the Procrustes, and three sealed copies, of\none of which I am the fortunate possessor.\"\n\nAfter this deliverance, it is not surprising that, at our next auction,\na sealed copy of Baxter's Procrustes was knocked down, after spirited\nbidding, for two hundred and fifty dollars, the highest price ever\nbrought by a single volume published by the club.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HEART OF THE RACE PROBLEM by Quincy Ewing\n\n\n\"And, instead of going to the Congress of the United States and saying\nthere is no distinction made in Mississippi, because of color or\nprevious condition of servitude, tell the truth, and say this: 'We\ntried for many years to live in Mississippi, and share sovereignty and\ndominion with the Negro, and we saw our institutions crumbling.... We\nrose in the majesty and highest type of Anglo-Saxon manhood, and took\nthe reins of government out of the hands of the carpet-bagger and\nthe Negro, and, so help us God, from now on we will never share any\nsovereignty or dominion with him again.'\"--Governor JAMES K. VARDAMAN,\nMississippi, 1904.\n\n\nDuring the past decade, newspaper and magazine articles galore, and not\na few books, have been written on what is called the \"Race Problem,\" the\nproblem caused by the presence in this country of some ten millions of\nblack and variously-shaded colored people known as Negroes. But, strange\nas it may sound, the writer has no hesitation in saying that at this\ndate there appears to be no clear conception anywhere, on the part of\nmost people, as to just what the essential problem is which\nconfronts the white inhabitants of the country because they have for\nfellow-citizens (nominally) ten million Negroes. Ask the average man,\nask even the average editor or professor anywhere, what the race problem\nis, the heart of it; why, in this land with its millions of foreigners\nof all nationalities, THE race problem of problems should be caused\nby ten million Negroes, not foreigners but native to the soil through\nseveral generations; and in all probability you will get some such\nanswer as this:--\n\n\"The Negroes, as a rule, are very ignorant, are very lazy, are very\nbrutal, are very criminal. But a little way removed from savagery, they\nare incapable of adopting the white man's moral code, of assimilating\nthe white man's moral sentiments, of striving toward the white man's\nmoral ideals. They are creatures of brutal, untamed instincts,\nand uncontrolled feral passions, which give frequent expression of\nthemselves in crimes of horrible ferocity. They are, in brief, an\nuncivilized, semi-savage people, living in a civilization to which they\nare unequal, partaking to a limited degree of its benefits, performing\nin no degree its duties. Because they are spatially in a civilization to\nwhich they are morally and intellectually repugnant, they cannot but be\nas a foreign irritant to the body social. The problem is, How shall the\nbody social adjust itself, daily, hourly, to this irritant; how feel\nat ease and safe in spite of it? How shall the white inhabitants of\nthe land, with their centuries of inherited superiority, conserve their\ncivilization and carry it forward to a yet higher plane, hampered by\nten million black inhabitants of the same land with their centuries of\ninherited inferiority?\"\n\nTo the foregoing answer, this might now and again be added, or advanced\nindependently in reply to our question: \"Personal aversion on the part\nof the white person for the Negro; personal aversion accounted for by\nnothing the individual Negro is, or is not, intellectually and morally;\naccounted for by the fact, simply, that he is a Negro, that he has a\nblack or colored skin, that he is different, of another kind.\"\n\nNow, certainly, there are very few average men or philosophers, to whom\nthe answer given to our question would not seem to state, or at any rate\nfairly indicate, the race problem in its essence. But, however few they\nbe, I do not hesitate to align myself with them as one who does not\nbelieve that the essential race problem as it exists in the South\n(whatever it be in the North) is stated, or even fairly indicated, in\nthe foregoing answer. In Northern and Western communities, where he\nis outnumbered by many thousands of white people, the Negro may be\naccounted a problem, because he is lazy, or ignorant, or brutal, or\ncriminal, or all these things together; or because he is black\nand different. But in Southern communities, where the Negro is not\noutnumbered by many thousands of white people, the race problem,\nessentially, and in its most acute form, is something distinct from\nhis laziness or ignorance, or brutality, or criminality, or all-round\nintellectual and moral inferiority to the white man. That problem as\nthe South knows and deals with it would exist, as certainly as it does\nto-day, if there were no shadow of excuse for the conviction that the\nNegro is more lazy, or more ignorant, or more criminal, or more brutal,\nor more anything else he ought not to be, or less anything else he\nought to be, than other men. In other words, let it be supposed that\nthe average Negro is as a matter of fact the equal, morally and\nintellectually, of the average white man of the same class, and the\nrace problem declines to vanish, declines to budge. We shall see why,\npresently. The statements just made demand immediate justification. For\nthey are doubtless surprising to a degree, and to some readers may prove\nstartling.\n\nI proceed to justify them as briefly as possible, asking the reader to\nbear in mind that very much more might be said along this line than I\nallow myself space to say.\n\n\nI\n\nThat the Negro is not a problem because he is lazy, because he declines\nto work, is evidenced by the patent fact that in virtually every\nSouthern community he is sought as a laborer in fields, mills, mines,\nand that in very many Southern communities the vexing problem for\nemployers is not too many, but too few Negroes. In certain agricultural\nsections, notably in the Louisiana sugar district, quite a number of\nItalians (\"Dagoes\") are employed. The reason is not dissatisfaction\nwith Negro labor, but simply that there is not enough of it to meet the\nrequirements of the large plantations. There is, perhaps, not one\nof these plantations on which any able-bodied Negro could not get\nemployment for the asking; and as a rule, the Negroes are given, not\nthe work which demands the lowest, but that which demands the highest,\nefficiency: they are the ploughmen, the teamsters, the foremen. If any\none doubts that Negroes are wanted as laborers in Southern communities,\nvery much wanted, let him go to any such community and attempt to\ninveigle a few dozen of the laziest away. He will be likely to take his\nlife in his hands, after the usual warning is disregarded!\n\n\nII\n\nThe small politician's trump-card, played early and late, and in all\nseasons, that the Negro is a black shadow over the Southland because\nof his excessive criminality, serves well the politician's purpose,--it\nwins his game; but only because the game is played and won on a board\nwhere fictions, not facts, are dominant. Nothing is easier than to offer\nso-called proofs of the contention that the Negro's tendency to crime is\nsomething peculiar to his race; there are the jail and penitentiary and\ngallows statistics, for instance. But surely it should not be difficult\nfor these so-called proofs to present themselves in their true light to\nany one who takes the trouble to consider two weighty and conspicuous\nfacts: this, first, that the Negroes occupy everywhere in this country\nthe lowest social and industrial plane, the plane which everywhere else\nsupplies the jail, the penitentiary, the gallows, with the greatest\nnumber of their victims; and secondly this, that in the section of the\ncountry where these penal statistics are gathered, all the machinery of\njustice is in the hands of white men.\n\nNo Negro is a sheriff, or judge, or justice of the peace, or grand or\npetit juryman, or member of a pardoning board. Charged with crime, again\nand again, the black man must go to jail; he is unable to give bond; he\nis defended, not by the ablest, but by the poorest lawyers, often by an\nunwilling appointee of the court; he lacks the benefit of that personal\nappeal to judge and jury, so often enjoyed by other defendants, which\nwould make them WANT to believe him innocent until proven guilty; he\nfaces, on the contrary, a judge and jury who hold him in some measure of\ncontempt as a man, regardless of his guilt or innocence. He is without\nmeans, except occasionally, to fight his case through appeals to higher\ncourts, and errors sleep in many a record that on review would upset the\nverdict. In the light of such considerations, it would seem impossible\nthat criminal statistics should not bear hard upon the Negro race, even\nsupposing it to be a fact that that race of all races in the world is\nthe LEAST criminal.\n\nLet it be admitted without question that in most Southern communities\nthe crimes and misdemeanors of the Negroes exceed those committed by an\nequal number of white people, and we have admitted nothing that at all\nexplains or accounts for the race problem. For is it not equally true\nthat in every other community the doers of society's rough work, the\nrecipients of its meagrest rewards, are chargeable, relatively, with the\ngreatest number of crimes and misdemeanors? Is it not true, as well in\nMassachusetts and Connecticut as in Louisiana and Mississippi, that the\nvast majority of those occupying prison cells are members of the social\nlowest class? that the vast majority condemned, after trial, to hard\nlabor with their hands were accustomed to such labor before their\njudicial condemnation? Nothing is more preposterous than the idea that\nthe race problem means more Negroes hanged, more Negroes imprisoned,\nmore Negroes in mines and chain-gangs, than white people! If the Negro\ndid not furnish the great bulk of the grist for the grinding of our\npenal machinery in the Southern states, he would constitute the racial\nmiracle of this and all ages!\n\nMy own conviction is, and I speak with the experience of forty years'\nresidence in Southern states, that the Negro is not more given to crimes\nand misdemeanors than the laboring population of any other section of\nthe country. But be this as it may, it is abundantly certain that no\nrace of people anywhere are more easily controlled than the Negroes by\nthe guardians of law and order; and there are none anywhere so easily\npunished for disobedience to the statutes and mandates of their economic\nsuperiors. Courts and juries may be sometimes subject to just criticism\nfor undue leniency toward white defendants; but that courts and juries\nare ever subject to just criticism for undue leniency in dealing with\nblack defendants is the sheerest nonsense.\n\nThe frequent charge that the Negro's worst crimes partake of a brutality\nthat is peculiarly racial, is not supported by facts. I need not enlarge\nupon this statement further than to say that the Negro's worst crimes,\nwith all their shocking accompaniments, are, not seldom, but often,\nduplicated by white men. Let any one who doubts the statement observe\nfor one week the criminal statistics of any cosmopolitan newspaper, and\nhe will have his doubt removed.\n\nAssuredly we do not hit upon the essence of the race problem in the\nNegro's propensity to crime!\n\n\nIII\n\nDo we hit upon it in his ignorance, in the fact that an immense number\nof the black people are illiterate, not knowing the first from the last\nletter of the alphabet? Hardly. For, almost to a man, the people who\nmost parade and most rail at the race problem in private conversation,\non the political platform, and in the pages of newspapers, books, and\nperiodicals, are disposed rather to lament, than to assist, the passing\nof the Negro's ignorance. Ex-Governor Vardaman, of Mississippi, used\nthe following language in a message to the legislature of that state,\nJanuary, 1906:--\n\n\"The startling facts revealed by the census show that those [Negroes]\nwho can read and write are more criminal than the illiterate, which\nis true of no other element of our population.. .. The state for many\nyears, at great expense to the tax-payers, has maintained a system\nof Negro education which has produced disappointing results, and I am\nopposed to the perpetuation of this system. My own idea is, that the\ncharacter of education for the Negro ought to be changed. If, after\nforty years of earnest effort, and the expenditure of fabulous sums to\neducate his head, we have only succeeded in making a criminal of him\nand impairing his usefulness and efficiency as a laborer, wisdom would\nsuggest that we make another experiment and see if we cannot improve him\nby educating his hand and his heart.... Slavery is the only process by\nwhich he has ever been partially civilized. God Almighty created the\nNegro for a menial, he is essentially a servant.\"\n\nThis is the reply of an ex-governor of one of our blackest states to\nthose who contend that the negro is a problem, a \"burden carried by\nthe white people of the South,\" because of his ignorance and consequent\ninefficiency; and that the lightening of the burden depends upon more\nmoney spent, more earnest efforts made, for the schooling of the black\npeople. According to this ex-governor, and there are thousands who agree\nwith him in and out of Mississippi, the race problem is heightened,\nrather than mitigated, by all attempts to increase the negro's\nintellectual efficiency. The more ignorant he is, the less burdensome he\nis to the white man, provided his heart be good, and his hands skillful\nenough to do the service of a menial. Nothing but slavery ever partially\ncivilized him, nothing but slavery continued in some form can civilize\nhim further!\n\n\nIV\n\nIf we listen vainly for the heart-throb of the race problem in the\nNegro's laziness, and criminality, and brutality, and ignorance, and\ninefficiency, do we detect it with clearness and certainty in the\npersonal aversion felt by the white people for the black people,\naversion which the white people can no more help feeling than the black\npeople can help exciting? Is this the real trouble, the real burden, the\nreal tragedy and sorrow of our white population in those sections of the\ncountry where the Negroes are many,--that they are compelled to dwell\nface to face, day by day, with an inferior, degraded population,\nrepulsive to their finer sensibilities, obnoxious to them in countless\nways inexplicable? Facts are far from furnishing an affirmative answer.\nHowever pronounced may be the feeling of personal aversion toward the\nNegroes in Northern communities, where they are few, or known at long\nrange, or casually, there is no such thing in Southern communities as\npersonal aversion for the Negro pronounced enough to be responsible for\nanything resembling a problem. How could there be in the South, where\nfrom infancy we have all been as familiar with black faces as with\nwhite; where many of us fell asleep in the laps of black mammies, and\nhad for playmates Ephrom, Izik, Zeke, black mammy's grandchildren; where\nmost of us have had our meals prepared by black cooks, and been waited\non by black house-servants and dining-room servants, and ridden in\ncarriages and buggies with black hostlers? We are so used to the black\npeople in the South, their mere personal presence is so far from being\nresponsible for our race problem, that the South would not seem Southern\nwithout them, as it would not without its crape myrtles, and live-oaks,\nand magnolias, its cotton and its sugar-cane!\n\nIt is very easy to go astray in regard to the matter of personal\naversion toward the members of alien races, to magnify greatly the\nreality and importance of it. What seems race-aversion is frequently\nsomething else, namely, revulsion aroused by the presence of the\nstrange, the unusual, the uncanny, the not-understood. Such revulsion is\naroused, not only by the members of alien races, alien and unfamiliar,\nbut as certainly by strange animals of not more terrifying appearance\nthan the well-loved cow and horse; and it would be aroused as really\nand as painfully, doubtless, by the sudden proximity of one of Milton's\narchangels. It was not necessarily race-aversion which made Emerson,\nand may have made many another Concord philosopher, uncomfortable in the\npresence of a Negro, any more than it is race-aversion which makes the\nFifth Avenue boy run from the gentle farmyard cow; any more than it is\nrace-aversion which would make me uncomfortable in the presence of Li\nHung Chang. The Negro, simply, it may be, was a mystery to Emerson, as\nthe farmyard cow is a mystery to the Fifth Avenue boy, as the Chinaman\nis a mystery to me.\n\nThe Negro is NOT a mystery to people whom he has nursed and waited on,\nwhose language he has spoken, whose ways, good and bad, he has copied\nfor generations; and his personal presence does not render them\nuncomfortable, not, at any rate, uncomfortable enough to beget the sense\nof a burden or a problem.\n\nIt may be very difficult for Northern readers, to whom the Negro is in\nreality a stranger, a foreigner, to appreciate fully the force of what\nhas just been said; but appreciated by them it must be, or they can\nnever hope to realize the innermost meaning of the race problem in the\nSouth.\n\n\nSo much for what the race problem is not. Let me without further delay\nstate what it is. The foundation of it, true or false, is the white\nman's conviction that the Negro as a race, and as an individual, is his\ninferior: not human in the sense that he is human, not entitled to\nthe exercise of human rights in the sense that he is entitled to the\nexercise of them. The problem itself, the essence of it, the heart\nof it, is the white man's determination to make good this conviction,\ncoupled with constant anxiety lest, by some means, he should fail to\nmake it good. The race problem, in other words, is NOT that the Negro is\nwhat he is in relation to the white man, the white man's inferior; but\nthis, rather: How to keep him what he is in relation to the white man;\nhow to prevent his ever achieving or becoming that which would justify\nthe belief on his part, or on the part of other people, that he and the\nwhite man stand on common human ground.\n\nThat such is the heart of the problem should be made evident by this\ngeneral consideration alone: namely, that everywhere in the South\nfriction between the races is entirely absent so long as the Negro\njustifies the white man's opinion of him as an inferior; is grateful for\nprivileges and lays no claim to RIGHTS. Let him seem content to be as\nthe South insists he shall be, and not only is he not harshly treated,\nnot abused, and never boycotted, but he is shown much kindness and\ngenerosity, and employment awaits him for the asking. Trouble brews when\nhe begins to manifest those qualities, to reveal those tastes, to\ngive vent to those ambitions, which are supposed to be characteristic\nexclusively of the higher human type, and which, unless restrained,\nwould result in confounding the lower with the higher. The expression\n\"Good Nigger\" means everywhere in the South a real Negro, from the\nSouthern standpoint, one who in no respect gets out of focus with that\nstandpoint; the expression \"Bad Nigger\" means universally one who in\nsome respect, not necessarily criminal, does get out of focus with it.\nSo, stated differently, the race problem is the problem how to keep the\nNegro in focus with the traditional standpoint.\n\nBut we are very far from needing to rely upon any general consideration\nin support of the proposition advanced above. It is supported by\nevidences on every hand, waiting only the eye of recognition. Scarcely\na day passes but something is said or done with this end in view, to\nemphasize, lest they forget, the conviction for both white man and Negro\nthat the latter is and must remain an inferior. Let me instance a few\nsuch evidences.\n\nConsider, first, the \"Jim Crow\" legislation in the manner of its\nenforcement. Such legislation is supposed to have for its object the\nseparation of the races in trains, street-cars, etc., to save the\nwhite people from occasional contact with drunken, rowdy, ill-smelling\nNegroes, and to prevent personal encounters between the whites and\nblacks. How is this object attained in the street cars of Southern\ncities? Members of the different races occupy the same cars, separated\nonly by absurdly inadequate little open-mesh wire screens, so tiny and\nlight that a conductor can move them from one seat to another with the\nstrength of his little finger. Needless to add, these screens would\nserve to obscure neither sound, sight, nor smell of drunken rowdies\nwho sat behind them! In summer cars black and white passengers may be\nseparated not even by a make-believe screen; they are simply required,\nrespectively, to occupy certain seats in the front or the back end of\nthe cars.\n\nIn Birmingham, Alabama, the front seats are assigned to Negroes in all\nclosed cars, and the back seats in all open ones. Why the front seats\nin the one case, and the back seats in the other, it is not easy to\nunderstand in the light of the letter and alleged spirit of the Jim Crow\nlaw! The underlying purpose of the law is clearly not the separation\nof the races in space; for public sentiment does not insist upon its\nfulfillment to that end. The underlying purpose of it would seem to be\nthe separation of the races in status. The doctrine of inequality would\nbe attacked if white and black passengers rode in public conveyances on\nequal terms; therefore the Negro who rides in a public conveyance\nmust do so, not as of undoubted right, but as with the white man's\npermission, subject to the white man's regulation. \"This place you may\noccupy, that other you may not, because I am I and you are you, lest to\nyou or me it should be obscured that I am I and you are you.\" Such is\nthe real spirit of the Jim Crow laws.\n\nWhy is it that in every Southern city no Negro is allowed to witness a\ndramatic performance, or a baseball game, from a first-class seat? In\nevery large city, there are hundreds of Negroes who would gladly pay\nfor first-class seats at the theatre and the baseball game, were they\npermitted to. It can hardly be that permission is withheld because\ntheatres and baseball games are so well attended by half the population\nthat first-class seats could not be furnished for the other half. As a\nmatter of fact, theatre-auditoriums and baseball grand-stands are seldom\ncrowded; the rule is, not all first-class seats occupied, but many\nvacant. Surely as simple as moving from seat to seat a make-shift screen\nin a street-car, would it be to set apart a certain number of seats\nin the dress-circle of every theatre, and in the grand-stand of every\nbaseball park, for Negro patrons. The reason why this is not done is\nperfectly obvious: it would be intolerable to the average Southern\nman or woman to sit through the hours of a theatrical performance or a\nbaseball game on terms of equal accommodation with Negroes, even with a\nscreen between. Negroes would look out of place, out of status, in the\ndress circle or the grand-stand; their place, signifying their status,\nis the peanut-gallery, or the bleachers. There, neither they nor others\nwill be tempted to forget that as things are they must continue.\n\nHow shall we account for the \"intense feeling\" (to quote the language\nof the mayor or New Orleans) occasioned in that city one day, last July,\nwhen it was flashed over the wires that the first prize in the National\nSpelling Contest had been won by a Negro girl, in competition with white\nchildren from New Orleans and other Southern cities? The indignation of\nat least one of the leading New Orleans papers verged upon hysterics;\nthe editor's rhetoric visited upon some foulest crime could hardly\nhave been more inflamed than in denunciation of the fact that, on the\nfar-away shore of Lake Erie, New Orleans white children had competed at\na spelling bee with a Negro girl. The superintendent of the New Orleans\nschools was roundly denounced in many quarters for permitting his wards\nto compete with a Negro; and there were broad hints in \"Letters from the\nPeople\" to the papers that his resignation was in order.\n\nCertainly in the days following the National Spelling Contest the race\nproblem was in evidence, if it ever was, in New Orleans and the South!\nDid it show itself, then, as the problem of Negro crime, or brutality,\nor laziness? Assuredly not! Of the Negro's personal repulsiveness? By\nno means! There was no evidence of Negro criminality, or brutality, or\nlaziness in the Negro child's victory; and every day in the South,\nin their games and otherwise, hundreds of white children of the best\nfamilies are in closer personal contact with little Negroes than were\nthe white children who took part in the Cleveland spelling bee. The\n\"intense feeling\" can be explained on one ground only: the Negro girl's\nvictory was an affront to the tradition of the Negro's inferiority;\nit suggested--perhaps indicated--that, given equal opportunities, all\nNegroes are not necessarily the intellectual inferiors of all white\npeople. What other explanation is rationally conceivable? If the race\nproblem means in the South to its white inhabitants the burden and\ntragedy of having to dwell face to face with an intellectually and\nmorally backward people, why should not the Negro girl's triumph have\noccasioned intense feeling of pleasure, rather than displeasure, by its\nsuggestion that her race is not intellectually hopeless?\n\nConsider further that while no Negro, no matter what his occupation,\nor personal refinement, or intellectual culture, or moral character, is\nallowed to travel in a Pullman car between state lines, or to enter as\na guest a hotel patronized by white people, the blackest of Negro nurses\nand valets are given food and shelter in all first-class hotels, and\noccasion neither disgust, nor surprise in the Pullman cars. Here again\nthe heart of the race problem is laid bare. The black nurse with a white\nbaby in her arms, the black valet looking after the comfort of a white\ninvalid, have the label of their inferiority conspicuously upon them;\nthey understand themselves, and everybody understands them, to be\nservants, enjoying certain privileges for the sake of the person served.\nAlmost anything, the Negro may do in the South, and anywhere he may go,\nprovided the manner of his doing and his doing is that of an inferior.\nSuch is the premium put upon his inferiority; such his inducement to\nmaintain it.\n\nThe point here insisted on may be made clearer, if already it is not\nclear enough, by this consideration, that the man who would lose social\ncaste for dining with an Irish street-sweeper might be congratulated for\ndining with an Irish educator; but President Roosevelt would scarcely\nhave given greater offense by entertaining a Negro laborer at the White\nHouse than he gave by inviting to lunch there the Principal of Tuskegee\nInstitute. The race problem being what it is, the status of any Negro is\nlogically the status of every other. There are recognizable degrees\nof inferiority among Negroes themselves; some are vastly superior to\nothers. But there is only one degree of inferiority separating the Negro\nfrom the white person, attached to all Negroes alike. The logic of the\nsituation requires that to be any sort of black man is to be inferior to\nany sort of white man; and from this logic there is no departure in the\nSouth.\n\nInconsistent, perhaps, with what has been said may seem the defeat\nin the Louisiana Legislature (1908) of the anti-miscegenation bill, a\nmeasure designed to prohibit sexual cohabitation between white persons\nand Negroes; to be specific, between white men and Negro women. But\nthere was no inconsistency whatever in the defeat of that bill. In all\ntimes and places, the status of that portion of the female population,\nLecky's martyred \"priestesses of humanity,\" whose existence men have\ndemanded for the gratification of unlawful passion, has been that of\nsocial outcasts. They have no rights that they can insist upon; they\nare simply privileged to exist by society's permission, and may be\nany moment legislated out of their vocation. Hence the defeat of an\nanti-miscegenation measure by Southern legislators cannot be\nconstrued as a failure on their part to live up to their conviction\nof race-superiority. It must be construed, rather, as legislative\nunwillingness to restrict the white man's liberty; to dictate by statute\nthe kind of social outcast which he may use as a mere means to the\ngratification of his passion. To concede to Negro women the status of\na degraded and proscribed class, is not in any sense to overlook or\nobscure their racial inferiority, but on the contrary, it may be, to\nemphasize it. Precisely the same principle, in a word, compasses the\ndefeat of an anti-miscegenation bill which would compass the defeat of a\nmeasure to prohibit Negro servants from occupying seats in Pullman cars.\n\nAt the risk of reiteration, I must in concluding this article take sharp\nissue with the view of a recent very able writer, who asks the question,\n\"What, essentially, is the Race Problem?\" and answers it thus: \"The race\nproblem is the problem of living with human beings who are not like us,\nwhether they are in our estimation our 'superiors' or inferiors,\nwhether they have kinky hair or pigtails, whether they are slant-eyed,\nhook-nosed, or thick-lipped. In its essence, it is the same problem,\nmagnified, which besets every neighborhood, even every family.\"\n\nI have contended so far, and I here repeat, that the race problem is\nessentially NOT what this writer declares it to be. It is emphatically\nnot, in the South, \"the problem of living with human beings who are not\nlike us, whether they are in our estimation our superiors or inferiors.\"\nIt may be, it probably is, that in the North, where the Negro is largely\na stranger, a foreigner, very much to the same degree that the Chinese\nare strangers and foreigners in the South; and where, consequently, the\nNegro's personal repulsiveness is a much more significant force than\nit is in the South. Assuredly there would be no race problem, anywhere,\nwere there no contact with others unlike ourselves! The unlikeness\nof the unlike is everywhere its indispensable foundation. But we get\nnowhither unless we carefully distinguish between the foundation of the\nproblem and the problem itself. There is nothing in the unlikeness of\nthe unlike that is necessarily problematical; it may be simply accepted\nand dealt with as a fact, like any other fact. The problem arises only\nwhen the people of one race are minded to adopt and act upon some policy\nmore or less oppressive or repressive in dealing with the people of\nanother race. In the absence of some such policy, there has never been a\nrace problem since the world began. It is the existence of such a\npolicy become traditional, and supported by immovable conviction, which\nconstitutes the race problem of the Southern states.\n\nThere was an immensely tragic race problem distressing the South fifty\nyears ago; but who will suggest that it was the problem of \"living with\nhuman beings who are not like us?\" The problem then was, clearly, how to\nmake good a certain conviction concerning the unlike, how to maintain a\ncertain policy in dealing with them. What else is it today? The problem,\nHow to maintain the institution of chattel slavery, ceased to be at\nAppomattox; the problem, How to maintain the social, industrial, and\ncivic inferiority of the descendants of chattel slaves, succeeded it,\nand is the race problem of the South at the present time. There is no\nother.\n\nWhether the policy adopted by the white South, and supported, as I have\nsaid, by immovable conviction, is expedient or inexpedient, wise or\nunwise, righteous or unrighteous, these are questions which I have not\nsought to answer one way or another in this article. Perhaps they cannot\nbe answered at all in our time. Certain is it, that their only real and\nsatisfactory answer will be many years ahead of the present generation.\n\nIn the mean time, nothing could be more unwarranted, than to suppose\nthat the race problem of one section of this country is peculiar to\nthat section, because its white inhabitants are themselves in some\nsense peculiar; because they are peculiarly prejudiced, because they\nare peculiarly behind the hour which the high clock of civilization has\nstruck. Remove the white inhabitants of the South, give their place to\nthe white people of any other section of the United States, and, beyond\na peradventure, the Southern race problem, as I have defined it, would\ncontinue to be--revealed, perhaps, in ways more perplexing, more intense\nand tragic.\n\n\n\n\nNEGRO SUFFRAGE IN A DEMOCRACY by Ray Stannard Baker\n\n\nIn this paper I endeavor to lay down the fundamental principles which\nshould govern the Negro franchise in a democracy, and to outline a\npractical programme for the immediate treatment of the problem.\n\nAs I see it, the question of Negro suffrage in the United States\npresents two distinct aspects:--\n\nFIRST: the legal aspect.\n\nSECOND: the practical aspect.\n\nIt will be admitted, I think, without argument, that all governments do\nand of a necessity must exercise the right to limit the number of people\nwho are permitted to take part in the weighty responsibilities of the\nsuffrage. Some governments allow only a few men to vote; in an absolute\nmonarchy there is only one voter; other governments, as they become more\ndemocratic, permit a larger proportion of the people to vote.\n\nOur own government is one of the freest in the world in the matter of\nsuffrage; and yet we bar out, in most states, all women; we bar out\nMongolians, no matter how intelligent; we bar out Indians, and all\nforeigners who have not passed through a certain probationary stage\nand have not acquired a certain small amount of education. We also\ndeclare--for an arbitrary limit must be placed somewhere--that no person\nunder twenty-one years of age may exercise the right to vote, although\nsome boys of eighteen are to-day better equipped to pass intelligently\nupon public questions than many grown men. We even place adult white men\non probation until they have resided for a certain length of time, often\nas much as two years, in the state or the town where they wish to cast\ntheir ballots. Our registration and ballot laws eliminate hundreds of\nthousands of voters; and finally, we bar out everywhere the defective\nand criminal classes of our population. We do not realize, sometimes, I\nthink, how limited the franchise really is, even in America. We forget\nthat out of nearly ninety million people in the United States, fewer\nthan fifteen million cast their votes for President in 1908--or about\none in every six.\n\nThus the practice of a restricted suffrage is very deeply implanted in\nour system of government. It is everywhere recognized that even in\na democracy lines must be drawn, and that the ballot, the precious\ninstrument of government, must be hedged about with stringent\nregulations. The question is, where shall these lines be drawn in order\nthat the best interests, not of any particular class, but of the whole\nnation, shall be served.\n\nUpon this question, we, as free citizens, have the absolute right to\nagree or disagree with the present laws regulating suffrage; and if we\nwant more people brought in as partakers in government, or some people\nwho are already in, barred out, we have a right to organize, to agitate,\nto do our best to change the laws. Powerful organizations of women are\nnow agitating for the right to vote; there is an organization which\ndemands the suffrage for Chinese and Japanese who wish to become\ncitizens. It is even conceivable that a society might be founded to\nlower the suffrage age-limit from twenty-one to nineteen years, thereby\nendowing a large number of young men with the privileges, and therefore\nthe educational responsibilities, of political power. On the other hand,\na large number of people, chiefly in our Southern States, earnestly\nbelieve that the right of the Negro to vote should be curtailed, or even\nabolished.\n\nThus we disagree, and government is the resultant of all these diverse\nviews and forces. No one can say dogmatically how far democracy should\ngo in distributing the enormously important powers of active government.\nDemocracy is not a dogma; it is not even a dogma of free suffrage.\nDemocracy is a life, a spirit, a growth. The primal necessity of any\nsort of government, democracy or otherwise, whether it be more unjust or\nless unjust toward special groups of its citizens, is to exist, to be\na going concern, to maintain upon the whole a stable and peaceful\nadministration of affairs. If a democracy cannot provide such stability,\nthen the people go back to some form of oligarchy. Having secured a\nfair measure of stability, a democracy proceeds with caution toward the\nextension of the suffrage to more and more people--trying foreigners,\ntrying women, trying Negroes.\n\nAnd no one can prophesy how far a democracy will ultimately go in the\nmatter of suffrage. We know only the tendency. We know that in the\nbeginning, even in America, the right to vote was a very limited matter.\nIn the early years, in New England, only church-members voted; then the\nfranchise was extended to include property-owners; then it was enlarged\nto include all white adults; then to include Negroes; then, in several\nWestern States, to include women.\n\nThus the line has been constantly advancing, but with many fluctuations,\neddies, and back-currents--like any other stream of progress. At\nthe present time the fundamental principles which underlie popular\ngovernment, and especially the whole matter of popular suffrage, are\nmuch in the public mind. The tendency of government throughout the\nentire civilized world is strongly in the direction of placing more\nand more power in the hands of the people. In our own country we are\nenacting a remarkable group of laws providing for direct primaries in\nthe nomination of public officials, for direct election of United States\nSenators, and for direct legislation by means of the initiative and\nreferendum; and we are even going to the point, in many cities,\nof permitting the people to recall an elected official who is\nunsatisfactory. The principle of local option, which is nothing but that\nof direct government by the people, is being everywhere accepted. All\nthese changes affect, fundamentally, the historic structure of our\ngovernment, making it less republican and more democratic.\n\nStill more important and far-reaching in its significance is the\ntendency of our government, especially our Federal Government, to\nregulate or to appropriate great groups of business enterprises formerly\nleft wholly in private hands. More and more, private business is\nbecoming public business.\n\nNow, then, as the weight of responsibility upon the popular vote is\nincreased, it becomes more and more important that the ballot should\nbe jealously guarded and honestly exercised. In the last few years,\ntherefore, a series of extraordinary new precautions have been adopted:\nthe Australian ballot, more stringent registration systems, the stricter\nenforcement of naturalization laws to prevent the voting of crowds of\nunprepared foreigners, and the imposition by several states, rightly or\nwrongly, of educational and property tests. It becomes a more and more\nserious matter every year to be an American citizen, more of an honor,\nmore of a duty.\n\nAt the close of the Civil War, in a time of intense idealistic emotion,\nsome three-quarters of a million of Negroes, the mass of them densely\nignorant and just out of slavery, with the iron of slavery still in\ntheir souls, were suddenly given the political rights of free citizens.\nA great many people, and not in the South alone, thought then, and still\nthink, that it was a mistake to bestow the high powers and privileges\nof a wholly unrestricted ballot--a ballot which is the symbol of\nintelligent self-government--upon the Negro. Other people, of whom I am\none, believe that it was a necessary concomitant of the revolution; it\nwas itself a revolution, not a growth, and like every other revolution\nit has had its fearful reaction. Revolutions, indeed, change names, but\nthey do not at once change human relationships. Mankind is reconstructed\nnot by proclamations, or legislation, or military occupation, but by\ntime, growth, education, religion, thought. At that time, then, the\nnation drove down the stakes of its idealism in government far beyond\nthe point it was able to reach in the humdrum activities of everyday\nexistence. A reaction was inevitable; it was inevitable and perfectly\nnatural that there should be a widespread questioning as to whether\nall Negroes, or indeed any Negroes, should properly be admitted to full\npolitical fellowship. That questioning continues to this day.\n\nNow, the essential principle established by the Fifteenth Amendment to\nthe Constitution was not that all Negroes should necessarily be given an\nunrestricted access to the ballot; but that the right to vote should not\nbe denied or abridged 'on account of race, color, or previous condition\nof servitude.' This amendment wiped out the color-line in politics so\nfar as any written law could possibly do it.\n\nLet me here express my profound conviction that the principle of\npolitical equality then laid down is a sound, valid, and absolutely\nessential principle in any free government; that restrictions upon the\nballot, when necessary, should be made to apply equally to white and\ncolored citizens; and that the Fifteenth Amendment ought not to be,\nand cannot be repealed. Moreover, I am convinced that the principle of\npolitical equality is more firmly established to-day in this country\nthan it was forty years ago, when it had only Northern bayonets behind\nit. For now, however short the practice falls of reaching the legal\nstandard, the principle is woven into the warp and woof of Southern life\nand Southern legislation. Many Southern white leaders of thought are\nto-day CONVINCED, not FORCED believers in the principle; and that is a\ngreat omen.\n\nLimitations have come about, it is true, and were to be expected as\nthe back-currents of the revolution. Laws providing for educational\nand property qualifications as a prerequisite to the exercise of the\nsuffrage have been passed in all the Southern States, and have operated\nto exclude from the ballot large numbers of both white and colored\ncitizens, who on account of ignorance or poverty are unable to meet\nthe tests. These provisions, whatever the opinion entertained as to\nthe wisdom of such laws, are well within the principle laid down by\nthe Fifteenth Amendment. But several Southern States have gone a step\nfurther, and by means of the so-called 'grandfather laws,' have exempted\ncertain ignorant white men from the necessity of meeting the educational\nand property tests. These unfair 'grandfather laws,' however, in some of\nthe states adopting them, have now expired by limitation.\n\nLet me then lay down this general proposition:--\n\nNowhere in the South to-day is the Negro cut off LEGALLY, as a\nNegro, from the ballot. Legally, to-day, any Negro who can meet the\ncomparatively slight requirements as to education, or property, or both,\ncan cast his ballot on a basis of equality with the white man. I have\nemphasized the word legally, for I know the PRACTICAL difficulties which\nconfront the Negro votes in many parts of the South. The point I wish to\nmake is that legally the Negro is essentially the political equal of\nthe white man; but that practically, in the enforcement of the law, the\nlegislative ideal is still pegged out far beyond the actual performance.\n\nNow, then, if we are interested in the problem of democracy, we have two\ncourses open to us. We may think the laws are unjust to the Negro,\nand incidentally to the 'poor white' man as well. If we do, we have a\nperfect right to agitate for changes; and we can do much to disclose,\nwithout heat, the actual facts regarding the complicated and vexatious\nlegislative situation in the South, as regards the suffrage. Every\nchange in the legislation upon this subject should, indeed, be jealously\nwatched, that the principle of political equality between the races be\nnot legally curtailed. The doctrine laid down in the Fifteenth Amendment\nmust, at any hazard, be maintained.\n\nBut, personally,--and I am here voicing a profound conviction,--I think\nour emphasis at present should be laid upon the practical rather than\nupon the legal aspect of the problem; I think we should take advantage\nof the widely prevalent feeling in the South that the question of\nsuffrage has been settled, legally, for some time to come: of the desire\non the part of many Southern people, both white and colored, to turn\naside from the discussion of the political status of the Negro.\n\nIn short, let us for the time being accept the laws as they are, and\nbuild upward from that point. Let us turn our attention to the practical\ntask of finding out why it is that the laws we already have are not\nenforced, and how best to secure an honest vote for every Negro\nand equally for every 'poor white' man, who is able to meet the\nrequirements, but who for one reason or another does not or cannot now\nexercise his rights. I include the disfranchised white man as well as\nthe Negro, because I take it that we are interested, first of all, in\ndemocracy, and unless we can arouse the spirit of democracy, South and\nNorth, we can hope for justice neither for Negroes, nor for the poorer\nclass of white men, nor for the women of the factories and shops, nor\nfor the children of the cottonmills.\n\nTaking up this side of the problem we shall discover two entirely\ndistinct difficulties:--\n\nFirst, we shall find many Negroes, and indeed hundreds of thousands\nof white men as well, who might vote, but who, through ignorance, or\ninability or unwillingness to pay the poll-taxes, or from mere lack of\ninterest, disfranchise themselves.\n\nThe second difficulty is peculiar to the Negro. It consists in open\nor concealed intimidation on the part of the white men who control the\nelection machinery. In many places in the South to-day no Negro, how\nwell qualified, would dare to present himself for registration; when he\ndoes, he is rejected for some trivial or illegal reason.\n\nThus we have to meet a vast amount of apathy and ignorance and poverty\non the one hand, and the threat of intimidation on the other.\n\nFirst of all, for it is the chief injustice as between white and colored\nmen with which we have to deal,--an injustice which the law already\nmakes illegal and punishable,--how shall we meet the matter of\nintimidation? As I have already said, the door of the suffrage is\neverywhere legally open to the Negro, but a certain sort of Southerner\nbars the passage-way. He stands there and, law or no law, keeps out many\nNegroes who might vote; and he represents in most parts of the South the\nprevailing public opinion.\n\nShall we meet this situation by force? What force is available? Shall\nthe North go down and fight the South? You and I know that the North\nto-day has no feeling but friendship for the South. More than that--and\nI say it with all seriousness, because it represents what I have heard\nwherever I have gone in the North to make inquiries regarding the\nNegro problem--the North, wrongly or rightly, is to-day more than half\nconvinced that the South is right in imposing some measure of limitation\nupon the franchise. There is now, in short, no disposition anywhere in\nthe North to interfere in internal affairs in the South--not even with\nthe force of public opinion.\n\nWhat other force, then, is to be invoked? Shall the Negro revolt? Shall\nhe migrate? Shall he prosecute his case in the courts? The very asking\nof these questions suggests the inevitable reply.\n\nWe might as well, here and now, dismiss the idea of force, express or\nimplied. There are times of last resort which call for force; but this\nis not such a time.\n\nWhat other alternatives are there?\n\nAccepting the laws as they are, then, there are two methods of\nprocedure, neither sensational nor exciting. I have no quick cure to\nsuggest, but only old and tried methods of commonplace growth.\n\nThe underlying causes of the trouble in the country being plainly\nignorance and prejudice, we must meet ignorance and prejudice with their\nantidotes, education and association.\n\nEvery effort should be made to extend free education among both Negroes\nand white people. A great extension of education is now going forward in\nthe South. The Negro is not by any means getting his full share; but,\nas certainly as sunshine makes things grow, education in the South will\nproduce tolerance. That there is already such a growing tolerance no one\nwho has talked with the leading white men in the South can doubt. The\nold fire-eating, Negro-baiting leaders of the Tillman-Vardaman type\nare swiftly passing away: a far better and broader group is coming into\npower.\n\nIn his last book, Mr. Edgar Gardner Murphy, of Alabama, expresses this\nnew point of view when he says,--\n\n'There is no question here as to the unrestricted admission [to the\nballot] of the great masses of our ignorant and semi-ignorant blacks.\nI know no advocate of such admission. But the question is as to whether\nthe individuals of the race, upon conditions or restrictions legally\nimposed and fairly administered, shall be admitted to adequate and\nincreasing representation in the electorate. And as that question\nis more seriously and more generally considered, many of the leading\npublicists of the South, I am glad to say, are quietly resolved that the\nanswer shall be in the affirmative.'\n\nFrom an able Southern white man, a resident of New Orleans, I received\nrecently a letter containing these words:--\n\n'I believe we have reached the bottom, and a sort of quiescent period.\nI think it most likely that from now on there will be a gradual increase\nof the Negro vote. And I honestly believe that the less said about it,\nthe surer the increase will be.'\n\nEducation--and by education I mean education of all sorts, industrial,\nprofessional, classical, in accordance with each man's talents--will\nnot only produce breadth and tolerance, but will help to cure the apathy\nwhich now keeps so many thousands of both white men and Negroes from\nthe polls: for it will show them that it is necessary for every man\nto exercise all the political rights within his reach. If he fails\nvoluntarily to take advantage of the rights he already has, how shall he\nacquire more rights?\n\nAnd as ignorance must be met by education, so prejudice must be met with\nits antidote, which is association. Democracy does not consist in mere\nvoting, but in association, the spirit of common effort, of which the\nballot is a mere visible expression. When we come to know one another\nwe soon find that the points of likeness are much more numerous than the\npoints of difference. And this human association for the common good,\nwhich is democracy, is difficult to bring about anywhere, whether among\ndifferent classes of white people, or between white people and Negroes.\nAs one of the leaders of the Negro race, Dr. Du Bois, has said,--\n\n'Herein lies the tragedy of the age. Not that men are poor: all men know\nsomething of poverty. Not that men are wicked: who is good? Not that men\nare ignorant: what is truth? Nay, but that men know so little of each\nother.'\n\nAfter the Atlanta riot I attended a number of conferences between\nleading white men and leading colored men. It is true those meetings\nbore evidence of awkwardness and embarrassment, for they were among the\nfirst of the sort to take place in the South, but they were none the\nless valuable. A white man told me after one of the meetings,--\n\n'I did not know that there were any such sensible Negroes in the South.'\n\nAnd a Negro told me that it was the first time in his life that he had\never heard a Southern white man reason in a friendly way with a Negro\nconcerning their common difficulties.\n\nMore and more these associations of white and colored men, at certain\npoints of contact, must and will come about. Already, in connection\nwith various educational and business projects in the South, white and\ncolored men meet on common grounds, and the way has been opened to a\nwider mutual understanding. And it is common enough now, where it was\nunheard of a few years ago, for both white men and Negroes to speak\nfrom the same platform in the South. I have attended a number of\nsuch meetings. Thus slowly--awkwardly, at first, for two centuries of\nprejudice are not immediately overcome--the white man and Negro will\ncome to know one another, not merely as master and servant, but as\nco-workers. These things cannot be forced.\n\nOne reason why the white man and the Negro have not got together more\nrapidly in the South than they have, is because they have tried always\nto meet at the sorest points. When sensible people, who must live\ntogether whether or no, find that there are points at which they cannot\nagree, it is the part of wisdom to avoid these points, and to meet upon\nother and common interests. Upon no other terms, indeed, can a democracy\nexist, for in no imaginable future state will individuals cease to\ndisagree with one another upon something less than half of all the\nproblems of life.\n\n'Here we all live together in a great country,' say the apostles of this\nview; 'let us all get together and develop it. Let the Negro do his best\nto educate himself, to own his own land, and to buy and sell with the\nwhite people in the fairest possible way.'\n\nIt is wonderful, indeed, how close together men who are stooping to a\ncommon task soon come.\n\nNow, buying and selling, land ownership and common material pursuits,\nmay not be the highest points of contact between man and man, but they\nare real points, and help to give men an idea of the worth of their\nfellows, white or black. How many times, in the South, I heard white men\nspeak in high admiration of some Negro farmer who had been successful,\nor of some Negro blacksmith who was a worthy citizen, or of some Negro\ndoctor who was a leader of his race.\n\nIt is curious, once a man (any man, white or black) learns to do his job\nwell, how he finds himself in a democratic relationship with other men.\nI remember asking a prominent white citizen of a town in Central Georgia\nif he knew anything about Tuskegee. He said,--\n\n'Yes: I had rather a curious experience last fall. I was building a\nhotel and couldn't get any one to do the plastering as I wanted it done.\nOne day I saw two Negro plasterers at work in a new house that a friend\nof mine was building. I watched them for an hour. They seemed to know\ntheir trade. I invited them to come over and see me. They came, took the\ncontract for my work, hired a white man to carry mortar at a dollar\na day, and when they got through it was the best job of plastering\nin town. I found that they had learned their trade at Tuskegee. They\naveraged four dollars a day each in wages. We tried to get them to\nlocate in our town, but they went back to school.'\n\nWhen I was in Mississippi a prominent banker showed me his business\nletter-heads.\n\n'Good job, isn't it?' he said. 'A Negro printer did it. He wrote to me\nasking if he might bid on my work. I replied that although I had known\nhim a long time I couldn't give him the job merely because he was a\nNegro. He told me to forget his color, and said that if he couldn't do\nas good a job and do it as reasonably as any white man could, he didn't\nwant it. I let him try, and now he does most of our printing.'\n\nOut of such points of contact, then, encouraged by such wise leaders\nas Booker T. Washington, will grow an ever finer and finer spirit\nof association and of common and friendly knowledge. And that will\ninevitably lead to an extension upon the soundest possible basis of the\nNegro franchise. I know cases where white men have urged intelligent\nNegroes to come and cast their ballots, and have stood sponsor for them,\nout of genuine respect. As a result, to-day, the Negroes who vote in the\nSouth are, as a class, men of substance and intelligence, fully equal to\nthe tasks of citizenship.\n\nThus, I have boundless confidence not only in the sense of the white men\nof the South, but in the innate capability of the Negro, and that once\nthese two come really to know each other, not at sore points of contact,\nbut as common workers for a common country, the question of suffrage\nwill gradually solve itself along the lines of true democracy.\n\nAnother influence also will tend to change the status of the Negro as a\nvoter. That is the pending break-up of the political solidarity of the\nSouth. All the signs point to a political realignment upon new issues in\nthis country, both South and North. Old party names may even pass away.\nAnd that break-up, with the attendant struggle for votes, is certain\nto bring into politics thousands of Negroes and white men now\ndisfranchised. The result of a real division on live issues has been\nshown in many local contests in the South, as in the fight against the\nsaloons, when every qualified Negro voter, and every Negro who could\nqualify, was eagerly pushed forward by one side or the other. With such\na division on new issues the Negro will tend to exercise more and more\npolitical power, dividing, not on the color line, but on the principles\nat stake.\n\nThus in spite of the difficulties which now confront the Negro, I cannot\nbut look upon the situation in a spirit of optimism. I think sometimes\nwe are tempted to set a higher value upon the ritual of a belief than\nupon the spirit which underlies it. The ballot is not democracy: it\nis merely the symbol or ritual of democracy, and it may be full of\npassionate social, yes, even religious significance, or it may be a mere\nempty and dangerous formalism. What we should look to, then, primarily,\nis not the shadow, but the substance of democracy in this country. Nor\nmust we look for results too swiftly; our progress toward democracy is\nslow of growth and needs to be cultivated with patience and watered with\nfaith.\n\n\n\n\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY OF SOURCES -----------------------\n\nSOJOURNER TRUTH, THE LIBYAN SIBYL by Harriet Beecher Stowe Atlantic\nMonthly 11 (April 1863): 473-481.\n\nRECONSTRUCTION by Frederick Douglass Atlantic Monthly 18 (1866):\n761-765.\n\nAN APPEAL TO CONGRESS FOR IMPARTIAL SUFFRAGE by Frederick Douglas\nAtlantic Monthly 19 (Jan. 1867): 112-117.\n\nTHE NEGRO EXODUS by James B.
