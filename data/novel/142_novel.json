It had church\naccommodations for thirty-five thousand, which is the way of the Far\nWest and the South, where everybody is religious, and where each of the\nProtestant sects is represented and has a plant of its own. Rank was\nunknown in Lakeside--unconfessed, anyway; everybody knew everybody and\nhis dog, and a sociable friendliness was the prevailing atmosphere.\n\nSaladin Foster was book-keeper in the principal store, and the only\nhigh-salaried man of his profession in Lakeside. He was thirty-five\nyears old, now; he had served that store for fourteen years; he had\nbegun in his marriage-week at four hundred dollars a year, and had\nclimbed steadily up, a hundred dollars a year, for four years; from\nthat time forth his wage had remained eight hundred--a handsome figure\nindeed, and everybody conceded that he was worth it.\n\nHis wife, Electra, was a capable helpmeet, although--like himself--a\ndreamer of dreams and a private dabbler in romance. The first thing she\ndid, after her marriage--child as she was, aged only nineteen--was to\nbuy an acre of ground on the edge of the town, and pay down the cash for\nit--twenty-five dollars, all her fortune. Saladin had less, by fifteen.\nShe instituted a vegetable garden there, got it farmed on shares by the\nnearest neighbor, and made it pay her a hundred per cent. a year. Out of\nSaladin's first year's wage she put thirty dollars in the savings-bank,\nsixty out of his second, a hundred out of his third, a hundred and fifty\nout of his fourth. His wage went to eight hundred a year, then, and\nmeantime two children had arrived and increased the expenses, but she\nbanked two hundred a year from the salary, nevertheless, thenceforth.\nWhen she had been married seven years she built and furnished a\npretty and comfortable two-thousand-dollar house in the midst of her\ngarden-acre, paid half of the money down and moved her family in. Seven\nyears later she was out of debt and had several hundred dollars out\nearning its living.\n\nEarning it by the rise in landed estate; for she had long ago bought\nanother acre or two and sold the most of it at a profit to pleasant\npeople who were willing to build, and would be good neighbors and\nfurnish a general comradeship for herself and her growing family. She\nhad an independent income from safe investments of about a hundred\ndollars a year; her children were growing in years and grace; and\nshe was a pleased and happy woman. Happy in her husband, happy in her\nchildren, and the husband and the children were happy in her. It is at\nthis point that this history begins.\n\nThe youngest girl, Clytemnestra--called Clytie for short--was eleven;\nher sister, Gwendolen--called Gwen for short--was thirteen; nice girls,\nand comely. The names betray the latent romance-tinge in the parental\nblood, the parents' names indicate that the tinge was an inheritance. It\nwas an affectionate family, hence all four of its members had pet\nnames, Saladin's was a curious and unsexing one--Sally; and so was\nElectra's--Aleck. All day long Sally was a good and diligent book-keeper\nand salesman; all day long Aleck was a good and faithful mother and\nhousewife, and thoughtful and calculating business woman; but in the\ncozy living-room at night they put the plodding world away, and lived in\nanother and a fairer, reading romances to each other, dreaming dreams,\ncomrading with kings and princes and stately lords and ladies in the\nflash and stir and splendor of noble palaces and grim and ancient\ncastles.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nNow came great news! Stunning news--joyous news, in fact. It came from a\nneighboring state, where the family's only surviving relative lived. It\nwas Sally's relative--a sort of vague and indefinite uncle or second\nor third cousin by the name of Tilbury Foster, seventy and a bachelor,\nreputed well off and corresponding sour and crusty. Sally had tried to\nmake up to him once, by letter, in a bygone time, and had not made that\nmistake again. Tilbury now wrote to Sally, saying he should shortly die,\nand should leave him thirty thousand dollars, cash; not for love, but\nbecause money had given him most of his troubles and exasperations, and\nhe wished to place it where there was good hope that it would continue\nits malignant work. The bequest would be found in his will, and would be\npaid over. PROVIDED, that Sally should be able to prove to the executors\nthat he had _Taken no notice of the gift by spoken word or by letter,\nhad made no inquiries concerning the moribund's progress toward the\neverlasting tropics, and had not attended the funeral._\n\nAs soon as Aleck had partially recovered from the tremendous emotions\ncreated by the letter, she sent to the relative's habitat and subscribed\nfor the local paper.\n\nMan and wife entered into a solemn compact, now, to never mention the\ngreat news to any one while the relative lived, lest some ignorant\nperson carry the fact to the death-bed and distort it and make it appear\nthat they were disobediently thankful for the bequest, and just the\nsame as confessing it and publishing it, right in the face of the\nprohibition.\n\nFor the rest of the day Sally made havoc and confusion with his books,\nand Aleck could not keep her mind on her affairs, not even take up a\nflower-pot or book or a stick of wood without forgetting what she had\nintended to do with it. For both were dreaming.\n\n“Thir-ty thousand dollars!”\n\nAll day long the music of those inspiring words sang through those\npeople's heads.\n\nFrom his marriage-day forth, Aleck's grip had been upon the purse, and\nSally had seldom known what it was to be privileged to squander a dime\non non-necessities.\n\n“Thir-ty thousand dollars!” the song went on and on. A vast sum, an\nunthinkable sum!\n\nAll day long Aleck was absorbed in planning how to invest it, Sally in\nplanning how to spend it.\n\nThere was no romance-reading that night. The children took themselves\naway early, for their parents were silent, distraught, and strangely\nunentertaining. The good-night kisses might as well have been impressed\nupon vacancy, for all the response they got; the parents were not aware\nof the kisses, and the children had been gone an hour before\ntheir absence was noticed. Two pencils had been busy during that\nhour--note-making; in the way of plans. It was Sally who broke the\nstillness at last. He said, with exultation:\n\n“Ah, it'll be grand, Aleck! Out of the first thousand we'll have a horse\nand a buggy for summer, and a cutter and a skin lap-robe for winter.”\n\nAleck responded with decision and composure--\n\n“Out of the _capital_? Nothing of the kind. Not if it was a million!”\n\nSally was deeply disappointed; the glow went out of his face.\n\n“Oh, Aleck!” he said, reproachfully. “We've always worked so hard and\nbeen so scrimped: and now that we are rich, it does seem--”\n\nHe did not finish, for he saw her eye soften; his supplication had\ntouched her. She said, with gentle persuasiveness:\n\n“We must not spend the capital, dear, it would not be wise. Out of the\nincome from it--”\n\n“That will answer, that will answer, Aleck! How dear and good you are!\nThere will be a noble income and if we can spend that--”\n\n“Not _all _of it, dear, not all of it, but you can spend a part of it.\nThat is, a reasonable part. But the whole of the capital--every penny\nof it--must be put right to work, and kept at it. You see the\nreasonableness of that, don't you?”\n\n“Why, ye-s. Yes, of course. But we'll have to wait so long. Six months\nbefore the first interest falls due.”\n\n“Yes--maybe longer.”\n\n“Longer, Aleck? Why? Don't they pay half-yearly?”\n\n“_That _kind of an investment--yes; but I sha'n't invest in that way.”\n\n“What way, then?”\n\n“For big returns.”\n\n“Big. That's good. Go on, Aleck. What is it?”\n\n“Coal. The new mines. Cannel. I mean to put in ten thousand. Ground\nfloor. When we organize, we'll get three shares for one.”\n\n“By George, but it sounds good, Aleck! Then the shares will be\nworth--how much? And when?”\n\n“About a year. They'll pay ten per cent. half yearly, and be worth\nthirty thousand. I know all about it; the advertisement is in the\nCincinnati paper here.”\n\n“Land, thirty thousand for ten--in a year! Let's jam in the\nwhole capital and pull out ninety! I'll write and subscribe right\nnow--tomorrow it maybe too late.”\n\nHe was flying to the writing-desk, but Aleck stopped him and put him\nback in his chair. She said:\n\n“Don't lose your head so. _We_ mustn't subscribe till we've got the\nmoney; don't you know that?”\n\nSally's excitement went down a degree or two, but he was not wholly\nappeased.\n\n“Why, Aleck, we'll _have _it, you know--and so soon, too. He's probably\nout of his troubles before this; it's a hundred to nothing he's\nselecting his brimstone-shovel this very minute. Now, I think--”\n\nAleck shuddered, and said:\n\n“How _can _you, Sally! Don't talk in that way, it is perfectly\nscandalous.”\n\n“Oh, well, make it a halo, if you like, _I_ don't care for his outfit, I\nwas only just talking. Can't you let a person talk?”\n\n“But why should you _want _to talk in that dreadful way? How would you\nlike to have people talk so about _you_, and you not cold yet?”\n\n“Not likely to be, for _one _while, I reckon, if my last act was giving\naway money for the sake of doing somebody a harm with it. But never mind\nabout Tilbury, Aleck, let's talk about something worldly. It does seem\nto me that that mine is the place for the whole thirty. What's the\nobjection?”\n\n“All the eggs in one basket--that's the objection.”\n\n“All right, if you say so. What about the other twenty? What do you mean\nto do with that?”\n\n“There is no hurry; I am going to look around before I do anything with\nit.”\n\n“All right, if your mind's made up,” sighed Sally. He was deep in\nthought awhile, then he said:\n\n“There'll be twenty thousand profit coming from the ten a year from now.\nWe can spend that, can't we, Aleck?”\n\nAleck shook her head.\n\n“No, dear,” she said, “it won't sell high till we've had the first\nsemi-annual dividend. You can spend part of that.”\n\n“Shucks, only _that_--and a whole year to wait! Confound it, I--”\n\n“Oh, do be patient! It might even be declared in three months--it's\nquite within the possibilities.”\n\n“Oh, jolly! oh, thanks!” and Sally jumped up and kissed his wife in\ngratitude. “It'll be three thousand--three whole thousand! how much\nof it can we spend, Aleck? Make it liberal!--do, dear, that's a good\nfellow.”\n\nAleck was pleased; so pleased that she yielded to the pressure and\nconceded a sum which her judgment told her was a foolish extravagance--a\nthousand dollars. Sally kissed her half a dozen times and even in that\nway could not express all his joy and thankfulness. This new access\nof gratitude and affection carried Aleck quite beyond the bounds of\nprudence, and before she could restrain herself she had made her darling\nanother grant--a couple of thousand out of the fifty or sixty which she\nmeant to clear within a year of the twenty which still remained of the\nbequest. The happy tears sprang to Sally's eyes, and he said:\n\n“Oh, I want to hug you!” And he did it. Then he got his notes and sat\ndown and began to check off, for first purchase, the luxuries which\nhe should earliest wish to secure.\n“Horse--buggy--cutter--lap-robe--patent-leathers--dog--plug-hat--\nchurch-pew--stem-winder--new teeth--_say_, Aleck!”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“Ciphering away, aren't you? That's right. Have you got the twenty\nthousand invested yet?”\n\n“No, there's no hurry about that; I must look around first, and think.”\n\n“But you are ciphering; what's it about?”\n\n“Why, I have to find work for the thirty thousand that comes out of the\ncoal, haven't I?”\n\n“Scott, what a head! I never thought of that. How are you getting along?\nWhere have you arrived?”\n\n“Not very far--two years or three. I've turned it over twice; once in\noil and once in wheat.”\n\n“Why, Aleck, it's splendid! How does it aggregate?”\n\n“I think--well, to be on the safe side, about a hundred and eighty\nthousand clear, though it will probably be more.”\n\n“My! isn't it wonderful? By gracious! luck has come our way at last,\nafter all the hard sledding. Aleck!”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“I'm going to cash in a whole three hundred on the missionaries--what\nreal right have we care for expenses!”\n\n“You couldn't do a nobler thing, dear; and it's just like your generous\nnature, you unselfish boy.”\n\nThe praise made Sally poignantly happy, but he was fair and just enough\nto say it was rightfully due to Aleck rather than to himself, since but\nfor her he should never have had the money.\n\nThen they went up to bed, and in their delirium of bliss they forgot and\nleft the candle burning in the parlor. They did not remember until they\nwere undressed; then Sally was for letting it burn; he said they could\nafford it, if it was a thousand. But Aleck went down and put it out.\n\nA good job, too; for on her way back she hit on a scheme that would turn\nthe hundred and eighty thousand into half a million before it had had\ntime to get cold.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe little newspaper which Aleck had subscribed for was a Thursday\nsheet; it would make the trip of five hundred miles from Tilbury's\nvillage and arrive on Saturday. Tilbury's letter had started on Friday,\nmore than a day too late for the benefactor to die and get into that\nweek's issue, but in plenty of time to make connection for the next\noutput. Thus the Fosters had to wait almost a complete week to find out\nwhether anything of a satisfactory nature had happened to him or not.\nIt was a long, long week, and the strain was a heavy one. The pair could\nhardly have borne it if their minds had not had the relief of wholesome\ndiversion. We have seen that they had that. The woman was piling up\nfortunes right along, the man was spending them--spending all his wife\nwould give him a chance at, at any rate.\n\nAt last the Saturday came, and the _Weekly Sagamore_ arrived. Mrs.\nEversly Bennett was present. She was the Presbyterian parson's wife, and\nwas working the Fosters for a charity. Talk now died a sudden death--on\nthe Foster side. Mrs. Bennett presently discovered that her hosts\nwere not hearing a word she was saying; so she got up, wondering and\nindignant, and went away. The moment she was out of the house, Aleck\neagerly tore the wrapper from the paper, and her eyes and Sally's swept\nthe columns for the death-notices. Disappointment! Tilbury was not\nanywhere mentioned. Aleck was a Christian from the cradle, and duty and\nthe force of habit required her to go through the motions. She pulled\nherself together and said, with a pious two-per-cent. trade joyousness:\n\n“Let us be humbly thankful that he has been spared; and--”\n\n“Damn his treacherous hide, I wish--”\n\n“Sally! For shame!”\n\n“I don't care!” retorted the angry man. “It's the way _you _feel, and if\nyou weren't so immorally pious you'd be honest and say so.”\n\nAleck said, with wounded dignity:\n\n“I do not see how you can say such unkind and unjust things. There is no\nsuch thing as immoral piety.”\n\nSally felt a pang, but tried to conceal it under a shuffling attempt to\nsave his case by changing the form of it--as if changing the form while\nretaining the juice could deceive the expert he was trying to placate.\nHe said:\n\n“I didn't mean so bad as that, Aleck; I didn't really mean immoral\npiety, I only meant--meant--well, conventional piety, you know; er--shop\npiety; the--the--why, _you _know what I mean. Aleck--the--well, where\nyou put up that plated article and play it for solid, you know, without\nintending anything improper, but just out of trade habit, ancient\npolicy, petrified custom, loyalty to--to--hang it, I can't find the\nright words, but _you _know what I mean, Aleck, and that there isn't any\nharm in it. I'll try again. You see, it's this way. If a person--”\n\n“You have said quite enough,” said Aleck, coldly; “let the subject be\ndropped.”\n\n“I'm willing,” fervently responded Sally, wiping the sweat from his\nforehead and looking the thankfulness he had no words for. Then,\nmusingly, he apologized to himself. “I certainly held threes--_I know_\nit--but I drew and didn't fill. That's where I'm so often weak in\nthe game. If I had stood pat--but I didn't. I never do. I don't know\nenough.”\n\nConfessedly defeated, he was properly tame now and subdued. Aleck\nforgave him with her eyes.\n\nThe grand interest, the supreme interest, came instantly to the front\nagain; nothing could keep it in the background many minutes on a\nstretch. The couple took up the puzzle of the absence of Tilbury's\ndeath-notice. They discussed it every which way, more or less hopefully,\nbut they had to finish where they began, and concede that the only\nreally sane explanation of the absence of the notice must be--and\nwithout doubt was--that Tilbury was not dead. There was something sad\nabout it, something even a little unfair, maybe, but there it was, and\nhad to be put up with. They were agreed as to that. To Sally it seemed\na strangely inscrutable dispensation; more inscrutable than usual, he\nthought; one of the most unnecessary inscrutable he could call to mind,\nin fact--and said so, with some feeling; but if he was hoping to draw\nAleck he failed; she reserved her opinion, if she had one; she had not\nthe habit of taking injudicious risks in any market, worldly or other.\n\nThe pair must wait for next week's paper--Tilbury had evidently\npostponed. That was their thought and their decision. So they put the\nsubject away and went about their affairs again with as good heart as\nthey could.\n\nNow, if they had but known it, they had been wronging Tilbury all the\ntime. Tilbury had kept faith, kept it to the letter; he was dead, he had\ndied to schedule. He was dead more than four days now and used to it;\nentirely dead, perfectly dead, as dead as any other new person in the\ncemetery; dead in abundant time to get into that week's _Sagamore_, too,\nand only shut out by an accident; an accident which could not happen\nto a metropolitan journal, but which happens easily to a poor little\nvillage rag like the _Sagamore_. On this occasion, just as the editorial\npage was being locked up, a gratis quart of strawberry ice-water arrived\nfrom Hostetter's Ladies and Gents Ice-Cream Parlors, and the stickful of\nrather chilly regret over Tilbury's translation got crowded out to make\nroom for the editor's frantic gratitude.\n\nOn its way to the standing-galley Tilbury's notice got pied. Otherwise\nit would have gone into some future edition, for _weekly Sagamores_ do\nnot waste “live” matter, and in their galleys “live” matter is immortal,\nunless a pi accident intervenes. But a thing that gets pied is dead, and\nfor such there is no resurrection; its chance of seeing print is gone,\nforever and ever. And so, let Tilbury like it or not, let him rave in\nhis grave to his fill, no matter--no mention of his death would ever see\nthe light in the _Weekly Sagamore_.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nFive weeks drifted tediously along. The _Sagamore _arrived regularly\non the Saturdays, but never once contained a mention of Tilbury Foster.\nSally's patience broke down at this point, and he said, resentfully:\n\n“Damn his livers, he's immortal!”\n\nAleck give him a very severe rebuke, and added with icy solemnity:\n\n“How would you feel if you were suddenly cut off just after such an\nawful remark had escaped out of you?”\n\nWithout sufficient reflection Sally responded:\n\n“I'd feel I was lucky I hadn't got caught with it _in_ me.”\n\nPride had forced him to say something, and as he could not think of any\nrational thing to say he flung that out. Then he stole a base--as he\ncalled it--that is, slipped from the presence, to keep from being brayed\nin his wife's discussion-mortar.\n\nSix months came and went. The _Sagamore _was still silent about Tilbury.\nMeantime, Sally had several times thrown out a feeler--that is, a hint\nthat he would like to know. Aleck had ignored the hints. Sally now\nresolved to brace up and risk a frontal attack. So he squarely proposed\nto disguise himself and go to Tilbury's village and surreptitiously find\nout as to the prospects. Aleck put her foot on the dangerous project\nwith energy and decision. She said:\n\n“What can you be thinking of? You do keep my hands full! You have to be\nwatched all the time, like a little child, to keep you from walking into\nthe fire. You'll stay right where you are!”\n\n“Why, Aleck, I could do it and not be found out--I'm certain of it.”\n\n“Sally Foster, don't you know you would have to inquire around?”\n\n“Of course, but what of it? Nobody would suspect who I was.”\n\n“Oh, listen to the man! Some day you've got to prove to the executors\nthat you never inquired. What then?”\n\nHe had forgotten that detail. He didn't reply; there wasn't anything to\nsay. Aleck added:\n\n“Now then, drop that notion out of your mind, and don't ever meddle with\nit again. Tilbury set that trap for you. Don't you know it's a trap? He\nis on the watch, and fully expecting you to blunder into it. Well, he is\ngoing to be disappointed--at least while I am on deck. Sally!”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“As long as you live, if it's a hundred years, don't you ever make an\ninquiry. Promise!”\n\n“All right,” with a sigh and reluctantly.\n\nThen Aleck softened and said:\n\n“Don't be impatient. We are prospering; we can wait; there is no hurry.\nOur small dead-certain income increases all the time; and as to futures,\nI have not made a mistake yet--they are piling up by the thousands and\ntens of thousands. There is not another family in the state with such\nprospects as ours. Already we are beginning to roll in eventual wealth.\nYou know that, don't you?”\n\n“Yes, Aleck, it's certainly so.”\n\n“Then be grateful for what God is doing for us and stop worrying. You do\nnot believe we could have achieved these prodigious results without His\nspecial help and guidance, do you?”\n\nHesitatingly, “N-no, I suppose not.” Then, with feeling and admiration,\n“And yet, when it comes to judiciousness in watering a stock or putting\nup a hand to skin Wall Street I don't give in that _you _need any\noutside amateur help, if I do wish I--”\n\n“Oh, _do_ shut up! I know you do not mean any harm or any irreverence,\npoor boy, but you can't seem to open your mouth without letting out\nthings to make a person shudder. You keep me in constant dread. For you\nand for all of us. Once I had no fear of the thunder, but now when I\nhear it I--”\n\nHer voice broke, and she began to cry, and could not finish. The sight\nof this smote Sally to the heart and he took her in his arms and petted\nher and comforted her and promised better conduct, and upbraided himself\nand remorsefully pleaded for forgiveness. And he was in earnest, and\nsorry for what he had done and ready for any sacrifice that could make\nup for it.\n\nAnd so, in privacy, he thought long and deeply over the matter,\nresolving to do what should seem best. It was easy to _promise _reform;\nindeed he had already promised it. But would that do any real good, any\npermanent good? No, it would be but temporary--he knew his weakness,\nand confessed it to himself with sorrow--he could not keep the promise.\nSomething surer and better must be devised; and he devised it. At\ncost of precious money which he had long been saving up, shilling by\nshilling, he put a lightning-rod on the house.\n\nAt a subsequent time he relapsed.\n\nWhat miracles habit can do! and how quickly and how easily habits are\nacquired--both trifling habits and habits which profoundly change us.\nIf by accident we wake at two in the morning a couple of nights in\nsuccession, we have need to be uneasy, for another repetition can turn\nthe accident into a habit; and a month's dallying with whiskey--but we\nall know these commonplace facts.\n\nThe castle-building habit, the day-dreaming habit--how it grows! what a\nluxury it becomes; how we fly to its enchantments at every idle moment,\nhow we revel in them, steep our souls in them, intoxicate ourselves with\ntheir beguiling fantasies--oh yes, and how soon and how easily our dream\nlife and our material life become so intermingled and so fused together\nthat we can't quite tell which is which, any more.\n\nBy and by Aleck subscribed to a Chicago daily and for the _Wall Street\nPointer_. With an eye single to finance she studied these as diligently\nall the week as she studied her Bible Sundays. Sally was lost in\nadmiration, to note with what swift and sure strides her genius and\njudgment developed and expanded in the forecasting and handling of the\nsecurities of both the material and spiritual markets. He was proud of\nher nerve and daring in exploiting worldly stocks, and just as proud of\nher conservative caution in working her spiritual deals. He noted that\nshe never lost her head in either case; that with a splendid courage\nshe often went short on worldly futures, but heedfully drew the line\nthere--she was always long on the others. Her policy was quite sane and\nsimple, as she explained it to him: what she put into earthly futures\nwas for speculation, what she put into spiritual futures was for\ninvestment; she was willing to go into the one on a margin, and take\nchances, but in the case of the other, “margin her no margins”--she\nwanted to cash in a hundred cents per dollar's worth, and have the stock\ntransferred on the books.\n\nIt took but a very few months to educate Aleck's imagination and\nSally's. Each day's training added something to the spread and\neffectiveness of the two machines. As a consequence, Aleck made\nimaginary money much faster than at first she had dreamed of making it,\nand Sally's competency in spending the overflow of it kept pace with the\nstrain put upon it, right along. In the beginning, Aleck had given the\ncoal speculation a twelvemonth in which to materialize, and had been\nloath to grant that this term might possibly be shortened by nine\nmonths. But that was the feeble work, the nursery work, of a financial\nfancy that had had no teaching, no experience, no practice. These\naids soon came, then that nine months vanished, and the imaginary\nten-thousand-dollar investment came marching home with three hundred per\ncent. profit on its back!\n\nIt was a great day for the pair of Fosters. They were speechless for\njoy. Also speechless for another reason: after much watching of the\nmarket, Aleck had lately, with fear and trembling, made her first flyer\non a “margin,” using the remaining twenty thousand of the bequest\nin this risk. In her mind's eye she had seen it climb, point by\npoint--always with a chance that the market would break--until at last\nher anxieties were too great for further endurance--she being new to\nthe margin business and unhardened, as yet--and she gave her imaginary\nbroker an imaginary order by imaginary telegraph to sell. She said forty\nthousand dollars' profit was enough. The sale was made on the very day\nthat the coal venture had returned with its rich freight. As I have\nsaid, the couple were speechless, they sat dazed and blissful that\nnight, trying to realize that they were actually worth a hundred\nthousand dollars in clean, imaginary cash. Yet so it was.\n\nIt was the last time that ever Aleck was afraid of a margin; at least\nafraid enough to let it break her sleep and pale her cheek to the extent\nthat this first experience in that line had done.\n\nIndeed it was a memorable night. Gradually the realization that they\nwere rich sank securely home into the souls of the pair, then they began\nto place the money. If we could have looked out through the eyes of\nthese dreamers, we should have seen their tidy little wooden house\ndisappear, and two-story brick with a cast-iron fence in front of it\ntake its place; we should have seen a three-globed gas-chandelier grow\ndown from the parlor ceiling; we should have seen the homely rag carpet\nturn to noble Brussels, a dollar and a half a yard; we should have seen\nthe plebeian fireplace vanish away and a recherche, big base-burner with\nisinglass windows take position and spread awe around. And we should\nhave seen other things, too; among them the buggy, the lap-robe, the\nstove-pipe hat, and so on.\n\nFrom that time forth, although the daughters and the neighbors saw only\nthe same old wooden house there, it was a two-story brick to Aleck\nand Sally and not a night went by that Aleck did not worry about the\nimaginary gas-bills, and get for all comfort Sally's reckless retort:\n“What of it? We can afford it.”\n\nBefore the couple went to bed, that first night that they were rich,\nthey had decided that they must celebrate. They must give a party--that\nwas the idea. But how to explain it--to the daughters and the neighbors?\nThey could not expose the fact that they were rich. Sally was willing,\neven anxious, to do it; but Aleck kept her head and would not allow it.\nShe said that although the money was as good as in, it would be as well\nto wait until it was actually in. On that policy she took her stand, and\nwould not budge. The great secret must be kept, she said--kept from the\ndaughters and everybody else.\n\nThe pair were puzzled. They must celebrate, they were determined to\ncelebrate, but since the secret must be kept, what could they celebrate?\nNo birthdays were due for three months. Tilbury wasn't available,\nevidently he was going to live forever; what the nation _could _they\ncelebrate? That was Sally's way of putting it; and he was getting\nimpatient, too, and harassed. But at last he hit it--just by sheer\ninspiration, as it seemed to him--and all their troubles were gone in a\nmoment; they would celebrate the Discovery of America. A splendid idea!\n\nAleck was almost too proud of Sally for words--she said _she _never\nwould have thought of it. But Sally, although he was bursting with\ndelight in the compliment and with wonder at himself, tried not to let\non, and said it wasn't really anything, anybody could have done it.\nWhereat Aleck, with a prideful toss of her happy head, said:\n\n“Oh, certainly! Anybody could--oh, anybody! Hosannah Dilkins, for\ninstance! Or maybe Adelbert Peanut--oh, _dear_--yes! Well, I'd like to\nsee them try it, that's all. Dear-me-suz, if they could think of the\ndiscovery of a forty-acre island it's more than _I_ believe they could;\nand as for the whole continent, why, Sally Foster, you know perfectly\nwell it would strain the livers and lights out of them and _then_ they\ncouldn't!”\n\nThe dear woman, she knew he had talent; and if affection made her\nover-estimate the size of it a little, surely it was a sweet and gentle\ncrime, and forgivable for its source's sake.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe celebration went off well. The friends were all present, both the\nyoung and the old. Among the young were Flossie and Gracie Peanut and\ntheir brother Adelbert, who was a rising young journeyman tinner,\nalso Hosannah Dilkins, Jr., journeyman plasterer, just out of his\napprenticeship. For many months Adelbert and Hosannah had been showing\ninterest in Gwendolen and Clytemnestra Foster, and the parents of the\ngirls had noticed this with private satisfaction. But they suddenly\nrealized now that that feeling had passed. They recognized that the\nchanged financial conditions had raised up a social bar between\ntheir daughters and the young mechanics. The daughters could now look\nhigher--and must. Yes, must. They need marry nothing below the grade of\nlawyer or merchant; poppa and momma would take care of this; there must\nbe no mesalliances.\n\nHowever, these thinkings and projects of theirs were private, and\ndid not show on the surface, and therefore threw no shadow upon the\ncelebration. What showed upon the surface was a serene and lofty\ncontentment and a dignity of carriage and gravity of deportment which\ncompelled the admiration and likewise the wonder of the company. All\nnoticed it and all commented upon it, but none was able to divine the\nsecret of it. It was a marvel and a mystery. Three several persons\nremarked, without suspecting what clever shots they were making:\n\n“It's as if they'd come into property.”\n\nThat was just it, indeed.\n\nMost mothers would have taken hold of the matrimonial matter in the\nold regulation way; they would have given the girls a talking to, of\na solemn sort and untactful--a lecture calculated to defeat its own\npurpose, by producing tears and secret rebellion; and the said mothers\nwould have further damaged the business by requesting the young\nmechanics to discontinue their attentions. But this mother was\ndifferent. She was practical. She said nothing to any of the young\npeople concerned, nor to any one else except Sally. He listened to her\nand understood; understood and admired. He said:\n\n“I get the idea. Instead of finding fault with the samples on view,\nthus hurting feelings and obstructing trade without occasion, you merely\noffer a higher class of goods for the money, and leave nature to take\nher course. It's wisdom, Aleck, solid wisdom, and sound as a nut. Who's\nyour fish? Have you nominated him yet?”\n\nNo, she hadn't. They must look the market over--which they did. To start\nwith, they considered and discussed Brandish, rising young lawyer, and\nFulton, rising young dentist. Sally must invite them to dinner. But not\nright away; there was no hurry, Aleck said. Keep an eye on the pair, and\nwait; nothing would be lost by going slowly in so important a matter.\n\nIt turned out that this was wisdom, too; for inside of three weeks Aleck\nmade a wonderful strike which swelled her imaginary hundred thousand\nto four hundred thousand of the same quality. She and Sally were in the\nclouds that evening. For the first time they introduced champagne at\ndinner. Not real champagne, but plenty real enough for the amount of\nimagination expended on it. It was Sally that did it, and Aleck weakly\nsubmitted. At bottom both were troubled and ashamed, for he was a\nhigh-up Son of Temperance, and at funerals wore an apron which no dog\ncould look upon and retain his reason and his opinion; and she was a\nW. C. T. U., with all that that implies of boiler-iron virtue and\nunendurable holiness. But there it was; the pride of riches was\nbeginning its disintegrating work. They had lived to prove, once more,\na sad truth which had been proven many times before in the world: that\nwhereas principle is a great and noble protection against showy and\ndegrading vanities and vices, poverty is worth six of it. More than\nfour hundred thousand dollars to the good. They took up the matrimonial\nmatter again. Neither the dentist nor the lawyer was mentioned; there\nwas no occasion, they were out of the running. Disqualified. They\ndiscussed the son of the pork-packer and the son of the village banker.\nBut finally, as in the previous case, they concluded to wait and think,\nand go cautiously and sure.\n\nLuck came their way again. Aleck, ever watchful saw a great and risky\nchance, and took a daring flyer. A time of trembling, of doubt, of awful\nuneasiness followed, for non-success meant absolute ruin and nothing\nshort of it. Then came the result, and Aleck, faint with joy, could\nhardly control her voice when she said:\n\n“The suspense is over, Sally--and we are worth a cold million!”\n\nSally wept for gratitude, and said:\n\n“Oh, Electra, jewel of women, darling of my heart, we are free at last,\nwe roll in wealth, we need never scrimp again. It's a case for Veuve\nCliquot!” and he got out a pint of spruce-beer and made sacrifice, he\nsaying “Damn the expense,” and she rebuking him gently with reproachful\nbut humid and happy eyes.\n\nThey shelved the pork-packer's son and the banker's son, and sat down to\nconsider the Governor's son and the son of the Congressman.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nIt were a weariness to follow in detail the leaps and bounds the Foster\nfictitious finances took from this time forth. It was marvelous, it\nwas dizzying, it was dazzling. Everything Aleck touched turned to fairy\ngold, and heaped itself glittering toward the firmament. Millions upon\nmillions poured in, and still the mighty stream flowed thundering\nalong, still its vast volume increased. Five millions--ten\nmillions--twenty--thirty--was there never to be an end?\n\nTwo years swept by in a splendid delirium, the intoxicated Fosters\nscarcely noticing the flight of time. They were now worth three\nhundred million dollars; they were in every board of directors of every\nprodigious combine in the country; and still as time drifted along, the\nmillions went on piling up, five at a time, ten at a time, as fast as\nthey could tally them off, almost. The three hundred double itself--then\ndoubled again--and yet again--and yet once more.\n\nTwenty-four hundred millions!\n\nThe business was getting a little confused. It was necessary to take an\naccount of stock, and straighten it out. The Fosters knew it, they felt\nit, they realized that it was imperative; but they also knew that to do\nit properly and perfectly the task must be carried to a finish without\na break when once it was begun. A ten-hours' job; and where could _they\n_find ten leisure hours in a bunch? Sally was selling pins and sugar and\ncalico all day and every day; Aleck was cooking and washing dishes and\nsweeping and making beds all day and every day, with none to help, for\nthe daughters were being saved up for high society. The Fosters knew\nthere was one way to get the ten hours, and only one. Both were ashamed\nto name it; each waited for the other to do it. Finally Sally said:\n\n“Somebody's got to give in. It's up to me. Consider that I've named\nit--never mind pronouncing it out aloud.”\n\nAleck colored, but was grateful. Without further remark, they fell.\nFell, and--broke the Sabbath. For that was their only free ten-hour\nstretch. It was but another step in the downward path. Others would\nfollow. Vast wealth has temptations which fatally and surely undermine\nthe moral structure of persons not habituated to its possession.\n\nThey pulled down the shades and broke the Sabbath. With hard and patient\nlabor they overhauled their holdings and listed them. And a long-drawn\nprocession of formidable names it was! Starting with the Railway\nSystems, Steamer Lines, Standard Oil, Ocean Cables, Diluted Telegraph,\nand all the rest, and winding up with Klondike, De Beers, Tammany Graft,\nand Shady Privileges in the Post-office Department.\n\nTwenty-four hundred millions, and all safely planted in Good Things,\ngilt-edged and interest-bearing. Income, $120,000,000 a year. Aleck\nfetched a long purr of soft delight, and said:\n\n“Is it enough?”\n\n“It is, Aleck.”\n\n“What shall we do?”\n\n“Stand pat.”\n\n“Retire from business?”\n\n“That's it.”\n\n“I am agreed. The good work is finished; we will take a long rest and\nenjoy the money.”\n\n“Good! Aleck!”\n\n“Yes, dear?”\n\n“How much of the income can we spend?”\n\n“The whole of it.”\n\nIt seemed to her husband that a ton of chains fell from his limbs. He\ndid not say a word; he was happy beyond the power of speech.\n\nAfter that, they broke the Sabbaths right along as fast as they turned\nup. It is the first wrong step that counts. Every Sunday they put in the\nwhole day, after morning service, on inventions--inventions of ways to\nspend the money. They got to continuing this delicious dissipation until\npast midnight; and at every seance Aleck lavished millions upon great\ncharities and religious enterprises, and Sally lavished like sums upon\nmatters to which (at first) he gave definite names. Only at first. Later\nthe names gradually lost sharpness of outline, and eventually faded into\n“sundries,” thus becoming entirely--but safely--undescriptive. For Sally\nwas crumbling. The placing of these millions added seriously and most\nuncomfortably to the family expenses--in tallow candles. For a while\nAleck was worried. Then, after a little, she ceased to worry, for\nthe occasion of it was gone. She was pained, she was grieved, she was\nashamed; but she said nothing, and so became an accessory. Sally was\ntaking candles; he was robbing the store. It is ever thus. Vast wealth,\nto the person unaccustomed to it, is a bane; it eats into the flesh and\nbone of his morals. When the Fosters were poor, they could have been\ntrusted with untold candles. But now they--but let us not dwell upon it.\nFrom candles to apples is but a step: Sally got to taking apples; then\nsoap; then maple-sugar; then canned goods; then crockery. How easy it\nis to go from bad to worse, when once we have started upon a downward\ncourse!\n\nMeantime, other effects had been milestoning the course of the Fosters'\nsplendid financial march. The fictitious brick dwelling had given place\nto an imaginary granite one with a checker-board mansard roof; in time\nthis one disappeared and gave place to a still grander home--and so on\nand so on. Mansion after mansion, made of air, rose, higher, broader,\nfiner, and each in its turn vanished away; until now in these latter\ngreat days, our dreamers were in fancy housed, in a distant region, in a\nsumptuous vast palace which looked out from a leafy summit upon a\nnoble prospect of vale and river and receding hills steeped in tinted\nmists--and all private, all the property of the dreamers; a palace\nswarming with liveried servants, and populous with guests of fame and\npower, hailing from all the world's capitals, foreign and domestic.\n\nThis palace was far, far away toward the rising sun, immeasurably\nremote, astronomically remote, in Newport, Rhode Island, Holy Land of\nHigh Society, ineffable Domain of the American Aristocracy. As a rule\nthey spent a part of every Sabbath--after morning service--in this\nsumptuous home, the rest of it they spent in Europe, or in dawdling\naround in their private yacht. Six days of sordid and plodding fact life\nat home on the ragged edge of Lakeside and straitened means, the seventh\nin Fairyland--such had been their program and their habit.\n\nIn their sternly restricted fact life they remained as of old--plodding,\ndiligent, careful, practical, economical. They stuck loyally to the\nlittle Presbyterian Church, and labored faithfully in its interests\nand stood by its high and tough doctrines with all their mental and\nspiritual energies. But in their dream life they obeyed the invitations\nof their fancies, whatever they might be, and howsoever the fancies\nmight change. Aleck's fancies were not very capricious, and not\nfrequent, but Sally's scattered a good deal. Aleck, in her dream life,\nwent over to the Episcopal camp, on account of its large official\ntitles; next she became High-church on account of the candles and shows;\nand next she naturally changed to Rome, where there were cardinals and\nmore candles. But these excursions were a nothing to Sally's. His dream\nlife was a glowing and continuous and persistent excitement, and he kept\nevery part of it fresh and sparkling by frequent changes, the religious\npart along with the rest. He worked his religions hard, and changed them\nwith his shirt.\n\nThe liberal spendings of the Fosters upon their fancies began early\nin their prosperities, and grew in prodigality step by step with their\nadvancing fortunes. In time they became truly enormous. Aleck built\na university or two per Sunday; also a hospital or two; also a Rowton\nhotel or so; also a batch of churches; now and then a cathedral; and\nonce, with untimely and ill-chosen playfulness, Sally said, “It was\na cold day when she didn't ship a cargo of missionaries to persuade\nunreflecting Chinamen to trade off twenty-four carat Confucianism for\ncounterfeit Christianity.”\n\nThis rude and unfeeling language hurt Aleck to the heart, and she went\nfrom the presence crying. That spectacle went to his own heart, and in\nhis pain and shame he would have given worlds to have those unkind words\nback. She had uttered no syllable of reproach--and that cut him. Not one\nsuggestion that he look at his own record--and she could have made, oh,\nso many, and such blistering ones! Her generous silence brought a swift\nrevenge, for it turned his thoughts upon himself, it summoned before\nhim a spectral procession, a moving vision of his life as he had been\nleading it these past few years of limitless prosperity, and as he\nsat there reviewing it his cheeks burned and his soul was steeped in\nhumiliation. Look at her life--how fair it was, and tending ever upward;\nand look at his own--how frivolous, how charged with mean vanities,\nhow selfish, how empty, how ignoble! And its trend--never upward, but\ndownward, ever downward!\n\nHe instituted comparisons between her record and his own. He had found\nfault with her--so he mused--_he_! And what could he say for himself?\nWhen she built her first church what was he doing? Gathering other blase\nmultimillionaires into a Poker Club; defiling his own palace with it;\nlosing hundreds of thousands to it at every sitting, and sillily vain of\nthe admiring notoriety it made for him. When she was building her\nfirst university, what was he doing? Polluting himself with a gay\nand dissipated secret life in the company of other fast bloods,\nmultimillionaires in money and paupers in character. When she was\nbuilding her first foundling asylum, what was he doing? Alas! When she\nwas projecting her noble Society for the Purifying of the Sex, what was\nhe doing? Ah, what, indeed! When she and the W. C. T. U. and the Woman\nwith the Hatchet, moving with resistless march, were sweeping the fatal\nbottle from the land, what was he doing? Getting drunk three times a\nday. When she, builder of a hundred cathedrals, was being gratefully\nwelcomed and blest in papal Rome and decorated with the Golden Rose\nwhich she had so honorably earned, what was he doing? Breaking the bank\nat Monte Carlo.\n\nHe stopped. He could go no farther; he could not bear the rest. He rose\nup, with a great resolution upon his lips: this secret life should be\nrevealed, and confessed; no longer would he live it clandestinely, he\nwould go and tell her All.\n\nAnd that is what he did. He told her All; and wept upon her bosom; wept,\nand moaned, and begged for her forgiveness. It was a profound shock, and\nshe staggered under the blow, but he was her own, the core of her heart,\nthe blessing of her eyes, her all in all, she could deny him nothing,\nand she forgave him. She felt that he could never again be quite to her\nwhat he had been before; she knew that he could only repent, and not\nreform; yet all morally defaced and decayed as he was, was he not her\nown, her very own, the idol of her deathless worship? She said she was\nhis serf, his slave, and she opened her yearning heart and took him in.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nOne Sunday afternoon some time after this they were sailing the summer\nseas in their dream yacht, and reclining in lazy luxury under the awning\nof the after-deck. There was silence, for each was busy with his own\nthoughts. These seasons of silence had insensibly been growing more\nand more frequent of late; the old nearness and cordiality were waning.\nSally's terrible revelation had done its work; Aleck had tried hard to\ndrive the memory of it out of her mind, but it would not go, and the\nshame and bitterness of it were poisoning her gracious dream life. She\ncould see now (on Sundays) that her husband was becoming a bloated and\nrepulsive Thing. She could not close her eyes to this, and in these days\nshe no longer looked at him, Sundays, when she could help it.\n\nBut she--was she herself without blemish? Alas, she knew she was not.\nShe was keeping a secret from him, she was acting dishonorably toward\nhim, and many a pang it was costing her. _She was breaking the compact,\nand concealing it from him_. Under strong temptation she had gone into\nbusiness again; she had risked their whole fortune in a purchase of all\nthe railway systems and coal and steel companies in the country on a\nmargin, and she was now trembling, every Sabbath hour, lest through some\nchance word of hers he find it out. In her misery and remorse for this\ntreachery she could not keep her heart from going out to him in pity;\nshe was filled with compunctions to see him lying there, drunk and\ncontented, and never suspecting. Never suspecting--trusting her with\na perfect and pathetic trust, and she holding over him by a thread a\npossible calamity of so devastating a--\n\n“_Say_--Aleck?”\n\nThe interrupting words brought her suddenly to herself. She was grateful\nto have that persecuting subject from her thoughts, and she answered,\nwith much of the old-time tenderness in her tone:\n\n“Yes, dear.”\n\n“Do you know, Aleck, I think we are making a mistake--that is, you\nare. I mean about the marriage business.” He sat up, fat and froggy and\nbenevolent, like a bronze Buddha, and grew earnest. “Consider--it's more\nthan five years. You've continued the same policy from the start: with\nevery rise, always holding on for five points higher. Always when I\nthink we are going to have some weddings, you see a bigger thing ahead,\nand I undergo another disappointment. _I_ think you are too hard to\nplease. Some day we'll get left. First, we turned down the dentist and\nthe lawyer. That was all right--it was sound. Next, we turned down the\nbanker's son and the pork-butcher's heir--right again, and sound. Next,\nwe turned down the Congressman's son and the Governor's--right as\na trivet, I confess it. Next the Senator's son and the son of the\nVice-President of the United States--perfectly right, there's no\npermanency about those little distinctions. Then you went for the\naristocracy; and I thought we had struck oil at last--yes. We would\nmake a plunge at the Four Hundred, and pull in some ancient lineage,\nvenerable, holy, ineffable, mellow with the antiquity of a hundred and\nfifty years, disinfected of the ancestral odors of salt-cod and pelts\nall of a century ago, and unsmirched by a day's work since, and then!\nwhy, then the marriages, of course. But no, along comes a pair of real\naristocrats from Europe, and straightway you throw over the half-breeds.\nIt was awfully discouraging, Aleck! Since then, what a procession!\nYou turned down the baronets for a pair of barons; you turned down the\nbarons for a pair of viscounts; the viscounts for a pair of earls;\nthe earls for a pair of marquises; the marquises for a brace of dukes.\n_Now_, Aleck, cash in!--you've played the limit. You've got a job lot\nof four dukes under the hammer; of four nationalities; all sound in the\nwind and limb and pedigree, all bankrupt and in debt up to the ears.\nThey come high, but we can afford it. Come, Aleck, don't delay any\nlonger, don't keep up the suspense: take the whole lay-out, and leave\nthe girls to choose!”\n\nAleck had been smiling blandly and contentedly all through this\narraignment of her marriage policy, a pleasant light, as of triumph with\nperhaps a nice surprise peeping out through it, rose in her eyes, and\nshe said, as calmly as she could:\n\n“Sally, what would you say to--_royalty_?”\n\nProdigious! Poor man, it knocked him silly, and he fell over the\ngarboard-strake and barked his shin on the cat-heads. He was dizzy for a\nmoment, then he gathered himself up and limped over and sat down by\nhis wife and beamed his old-time admiration and affection upon her in\nfloods, out of his bleary eyes.\n\n“By George!” he said, fervently, “Aleck, you _are _great--the greatest\nwoman in the whole earth! I can't ever learn the whole size of you.\nI can't ever learn the immeasurable deeps of you. Here I've been\nconsidering myself qualified to criticize your game. _I!_ Why, if I had\nstopped to think, I'd have known you had a lone hand up your sleeve.\nNow, dear heart, I'm all red-hot impatience--tell me about it!”\n\nThe flattered and happy woman put her lips to his ear and whispered\na princely name. It made him catch his breath, it lit his face with\nexultation.\n\n“Land!” he said, “it's a stunning catch! He's got a gambling-hall, and\na graveyard, and a bishop, and a cathedral--all his very own. And all\ngilt-edged five-hundred-per-cent. stock, every detail of it; the tidiest\nlittle property in Europe; and that graveyard--it's the selectest in\nthe world: none but suicides admitted; _yes_, sir, and the free-list\nsuspended, too, _all _the time. There isn't much land in the\nprincipality, but there's enough: eight hundred acres in the graveyard\nand forty-two outside. It's a _sovereignty_--that's the main thing;\n_land's_ nothing. There's plenty land, Sahara's drugged with it.”\n\nAleck glowed; she was profoundly happy. She said:\n\n“Think of it, Sally--it is a family that has never married outside the\nRoyal and Imperial Houses of Europe: our grandchildren will sit upon\nthrones!”\n\n“True as you live, Aleck--and bear scepters, too; and handle them as\nnaturally and nonchantly as I handle a yardstick. It's a grand catch,\nAleck. He's corralled, is he? Can't get away? You didn't take him on a\nmargin?”\n\n“No. Trust me for that. He's not a liability, he's an asset. So is the\nother one.”\n\n“Who is it, Aleck?”\n\n“His Royal Highness\nSigismund-Siegfried-Lauenfeld-Dinkelspiel-Schwartzenberg Blutwurst,\nHereditary Grand Duke of Katzenyammer.”\n\n“No! You can't mean it!”\n\n“It's as true as I'm sitting here, I give you my word,” she answered.\n\nHis cup was full, and he hugged her to his heart with rapture, saying:\n\n“How wonderful it all seems, and how beautiful! It's one of the\noldest and noblest of the three hundred and sixty-four ancient German\nprincipalities, and one of the few that was allowed to retain its royal\nestate when Bismarck got done trimming them. I know that farm, I've been\nthere. It's got a rope-walk and a candle-factory and an army. Standing\narmy. Infantry and cavalry. Three soldier and a horse. Aleck, it's been\na long wait, and full of heartbreak and hope deferred, but God knows I\nam happy now. Happy, and grateful to you, my own, who have done it all.\nWhen is it to be?”\n\n“Next Sunday.”\n\n“Good. And we'll want to do these weddings up in the very regalest style\nthat's going. It's properly due to the royal quality of the parties\nof the first part. Now as I understand it, there is only one kind of\nmarriage that is sacred to royalty, exclusive to royalty: it's the\nmorganatic.”\n\n“What do they call it that for, Sally?”\n\n“I don't know; but anyway it's royal, and royal only.”\n\n“Then we will insist upon it. More--I will compel it. It is morganatic\nmarriage or none.”\n\n“That settles it!” said Sally, rubbing his hands with delight. “And it\nwill be the very first in America. Aleck, it will make Newport sick.”\n\nThen they fell silent, and drifted away upon their dream wings to the\nfar regions of the earth to invite all the crowned heads and their\nfamilies and provide gratis transportation to them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nDuring three days the couple walked upon air, with their heads in the\nclouds. They were but vaguely conscious of their surroundings; they saw\nall things dimly, as through a veil; they were steeped in dreams,\noften they did not hear when they were spoken to; they often did not\nunderstand when they heard; they answered confusedly or at random; Sally\nsold molasses by weight, sugar by the yard, and furnished soap when\nasked for candles, and Aleck put the cat in the wash and fed milk to\nthe soiled linen. Everybody was stunned and amazed, and went about\nmuttering, “What _can _be the matter with the Fosters?”\n\nThree days. Then came events! Things had taken a happy turn, and\nfor forty-eight hours Aleck's imaginary corner had been booming. Up--up-\n-still up! Cost point was passed. Still up--and up--and up! Five points\nabove cost--then ten--fifteen--twenty! Twenty points cold profit on the\nvast venture, now, and Aleck's imaginary brokers were shouting\nfrantically by imaginary long-distance, “Sell! sell! for Heaven's sake\n_sell_!”\n\nShe broke the splendid news to Sally, and he, too, said, “Sell!\nsell--oh, don't make a blunder, now, you own the earth!--sell, sell!”\n But she set her iron will and lashed it amidships, and said she would\nhold on for five points more if she died for it.\n\nIt was a fatal resolve. The very next day came the historic crash, the\nrecord crash, the devastating crash, when the bottom fell out of Wall\nStreet, and the whole body of gilt-edged stocks dropped ninety-five\npoints in five hours, and the multimillionaire was seen begging his\nbread in the Bowery. Aleck sternly held her grip and “put up” as long\nas she could, but at last there came a call which she was powerless to\nmeet, and her imaginary brokers sold her out. Then, and not till then,\nthe man in her was vanished, and the woman in her resumed sway. She put\nher arms about her husband's neck and wept, saying:\n\n“I am to blame, do not forgive me, I cannot bear it. We are paupers!\nPaupers, and I am so miserable. The weddings will never come off; all\nthat is past; we could not even buy the dentist, now.”\n\nA bitter reproach was on Sally's tongue: “I _begged _you to sell, but\nyou--” He did not say it; he had not the heart to add a hurt to that\nbroken and repentant spirit. A nobler thought came to him and he said:\n\n“Bear up, my Aleck, all is not lost! You really never invested a penny\nof my uncle's bequest, but only its unmaterialized future; what we\nhave lost was only the incremented harvest from that future by your\nincomparable financial judgment and sagacity. Cheer up, banish these\ngriefs; we still have the thirty thousand untouched; and with the\nexperience which you have acquired, think what you will be able to do\nwith it in a couple years! The marriages are not off, they are only\npostponed.”\n\nThese were blessed words. Aleck saw how true they were, and their\ninfluence was electric; her tears ceased to flow, and her great spirit\nrose to its full stature again. With flashing eye and grateful heart,\nand with hand uplifted in pledge and prophecy, she said:\n\n“Now and here I proclaim--”\n\nBut she was interrupted by a visitor. It was the editor and proprietor\nof the _Sagamore_. He had happened into Lakeside to pay a duty-call upon\nan obscure grandmother of his who was nearing the end of her pilgrimage,\nand with the idea of combining business with grief he had looked up\nthe Fosters, who had been so absorbed in other things for the past four\nyears that they neglected to pay up their subscription. Six dollars due.\nNo visitor could have been more welcome. He would know all about Uncle\nTilbury and what his chances might be getting to be, cemeterywards. They\ncould, of course, ask no questions, for that would squelch the bequest,\nbut they could nibble around on the edge of the subject and hope for\nresults. The scheme did not work. The obtuse editor did not know he was\nbeing nibbled at; but at last, chance accomplished what art had failed\nin. In illustration of something under discussion which required the\nhelp of metaphor, the editor said:\n\n“Land, it's as tough as Tilbury Foster!--as _we_ say.”\n\nIt was sudden, and it made the Fosters jump. The editor noticed, and\nsaid, apologetically:\n\n“No harm intended, I assure you. It's just a saying; just a joke, you\nknow--nothing in it. Relation of yours?”\n\nSally crowded his burning eagerness down, and answered with all the\nindifference he could assume:\n\n“I--well, not that I know of, but we've heard of him.” The editor was\nthankful, and resumed his composure. Sally added: “Is he--is he--well?”\n\n“Is he _well_? Why, bless you he's in Sheol these five years!”\n\nThe Fosters were trembling with grief, though it felt like joy. Sally\nsaid, non-committally--and tentatively:\n\n“Ah, well, such is life, and none can escape--not even the rich are\nspared.”\n\nThe editor laughed.\n\n“If you are including Tilbury,” said he, “it don't apply. _He_ hadn't a\ncent; the town had to bury him.”\n\nThe Fosters sat petrified for two minutes; petrified and cold. Then,\nwhite-faced and weak-voiced, Sally asked:\n\n“Is it true? Do you _know _it to be true?”\n\n“Well, I should say! I was one of the executors. He hadn't anything to\nleave but a wheelbarrow, and he left that to me. It hadn't any wheel,\nand wasn't any good. Still, it was something, and so, to square up, I\nscribbled off a sort of a little obituarial send-off for him, but it got\ncrowded out.”\n\nThe Fosters were not listening--their cup was full, it could contain\nno more. They sat with bowed heads, dead to all things but the ache at\ntheir hearts.\n\nAn hour later. Still they sat there, bowed, motionless, silent, the\nvisitor long ago gone, they unaware.\n\nThen they stirred, and lifted their heads wearily, and gazed at each\nother wistfully, dreamily, dazed; then presently began to twaddle to\neach other in a wandering and childish way. At intervals they lapsed\ninto silences, leaving a sentence unfinished, seemingly either unaware\nof it or losing their way. Sometimes, when they woke out of these\nsilences they had a dim and transient consciousness that something had\nhappened to their minds; then with a dumb and yearning solicitude they\nwould softly caress each other's hands in mutual compassion and support,\nas if they would say: “I am near you, I will not forsake you, we\nwill bear it together; somewhere there is release and forgetfulness,\nsomewhere there is a grave and peace; be patient, it will not be long.”\n\nThey lived yet two years, in mental night, always brooding, steeped in\nvague regrets and melancholy dreams, never speaking; then release came\nto both on the same day.\n\nToward the end the darkness lifted from Sally's ruined mind for a\nmoment, and he said:\n\n“Vast wealth, acquired by sudden and unwholesome means, is a snare. It\ndid us no good, transient were its feverish pleasures; yet for its\nsake we threw away our sweet and simple and happy life--let others take\nwarning by us.”\n\nHe lay silent awhile, with closed eyes; then as the chill of death crept\nupward toward his heart, and consciousness was fading from his brain, he\nmuttered:\n\n“Money had brought him misery, and he took his revenge upon us, who had\ndone him no harm. He had his desire: with base and cunning calculation\nhe left us but thirty thousand, knowing we would try to increase it, and\nruin our life and break our hearts. Without added expense he could\nhave left us far above desire of increase, far above the temptation\nto speculate, and a kinder soul would have done it; but in him was no\ngenerous spirit, no pity, no--”\n\n\n\nA DOG'S TALE\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nMy father was a St. Bernard, my mother was a collie, but I am a\nPresbyterian. This is what my mother told me, I do not know these\nnice distinctions myself. To me they are only fine large words meaning\nnothing. My mother had a fondness for such; she liked to say them, and\nsee other dogs look surprised and envious, as wondering how she got\nso much education. But, indeed, it was not real education; it was only\nshow: she got the words by listening in the dining-room and drawing-room\nwhen there was company, and by going with the children to Sunday-school\nand listening there; and whenever she heard a large word she said it\nover to herself many times, and so was able to keep it until there was\na dogmatic gathering in the neighborhood, then she would get it off,\nand surprise and distress them all, from pocket-pup to mastiff, which\nrewarded her for all her trouble. If there was a stranger he was nearly\nsure to be suspicious, and when he got his breath again he would ask her\nwhat it meant. And she always told him. He was never expecting this but\nthought he would catch her; so when she told him, he was the one that\nlooked ashamed, whereas he had thought it was going to be she. The\nothers were always waiting for this, and glad of it and proud of her,\nfor they knew what was going to happen, because they had had experience.\nWhen she told the meaning of a big word they were all so taken up with\nadmiration that it never occurred to any dog to doubt if it was the\nright one; and that was natural, because, for one thing, she answered up\nso promptly that it seemed like a dictionary speaking, and for another\nthing, where could they find out whether it was right or not? for she\nwas the only cultivated dog there was. By and by, when I was older, she\nbrought home the word Unintellectual, one time, and worked it pretty\nhard all the week at different gatherings, making much unhappiness and\ndespondency; and it was at this time that I noticed that during that\nweek she was asked for the meaning at eight different assemblages, and\nflashed out a fresh definition every time, which showed me that she had\nmore presence of mind than culture, though I said nothing, of course.\nShe had one word which she always kept on hand, and ready, like a\nlife-preserver, a kind of emergency word to strap on when she was likely\nto get washed overboard in a sudden way--that was the word Synonymous.\nWhen she happened to fetch out a long word which had had its day weeks\nbefore and its prepared meanings gone to her dump-pile, if there was a\nstranger there of course it knocked him groggy for a couple of minutes,\nthen he would come to, and by that time she would be away down wind on\nanother tack, and not expecting anything; so when he'd hail and ask her\nto cash in, I (the only dog on the inside of her game) could see her\ncanvas flicker a moment--but only just a moment--then it would belly\nout taut and full, and she would say, as calm as a summer's day, “It's\nsynonymous with supererogation,” or some godless long reptile of a\nword like that, and go placidly about and skim away on the next tack,\nperfectly comfortable, you know, and leave that stranger looking profane\nand embarrassed, and the initiated slatting the floor with their tails\nin unison and their faces transfigured with a holy joy.\n\nAnd it was the same with phrases. She would drag home a whole phrase,\nif it had a grand sound, and play it six nights and two matinees, and\nexplain it a new way every time--which she had to, for all she cared for\nwas the phrase; she wasn't interested in what it meant, and knew those\ndogs hadn't wit enough to catch her, anyway. Yes, she was a daisy! She\ngot so she wasn't afraid of anything, she had such confidence in the\nignorance of those creatures. She even brought anecdotes that she had\nheard the family and the dinner-guests laugh and shout over; and as\na rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut,\nwhere, of course, it didn't fit and hadn't any point; and when she\ndelivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and\nbarked in the most insane way, while I could see that she was wondering\nto herself why it didn't seem as funny as it did when she first heard\nit. But no harm was done; the others rolled and barked too, privately\nashamed of themselves for not seeing the point, and never suspecting\nthat the fault was not with them and there wasn't any to see.\n\nYou can see by these things that she was of a rather vain and frivolous\ncharacter; still, she had virtues, and enough to make up, I think. She\nhad a kind heart and gentle ways, and never harbored resentments for\ninjuries done her, but put them easily out of her mind and forgot them;\nand she taught her children her kindly way, and from her we learned also\nto be brave and prompt in time of danger, and not to run away, but face\nthe peril that threatened friend or stranger, and help him the best we\ncould without stopping to think what the cost might be to us. And she\ntaught us not by words only, but by example, and that is the best way\nand the surest and the most lasting. Why, the brave things she did, the\nsplendid things! she was just a soldier; and so modest about it--well,\nyou couldn't help admiring her, and you couldn't help imitating her;\nnot even a King Charles spaniel could remain entirely despicable in her\nsociety. So, as you see, there was more to her than her education.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nWhen I was well grown, at last, I was sold and taken away, and I never\nsaw her again. She was broken-hearted, and so was I, and we cried; but\nshe comforted me as well as she could, and said we were sent into\nthis world for a wise and good purpose, and must do our duties without\nrepining, take our life as we might find it, live it for the best good\nof others, and never mind about the results; they were not our affair.\nShe said men who did like this would have a noble and beautiful reward\nby and by in another world, and although we animals would not go there,\nto do well and right without reward would give to our brief lives\na worthiness and dignity which in itself would be a reward. She had\ngathered these things from time to time when she had gone to the\nSunday-school with the children, and had laid them up in her memory more\ncarefully than she had done with those other words and phrases; and she\nhad studied them deeply, for her good and ours. One may see by this that\nshe had a wise and thoughtful head, for all there was so much lightness\nand vanity in it.\n\nSo we said our farewells, and looked our last upon each other through\nour tears; and the last thing she said--keeping it for the last to make\nme remember it the better, I think--was, “In memory of me, when there\nis a time of danger to another do not think of yourself, think of your\nmother, and do as she would do.”\n\nDo you think I could forget that? No.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nIt was such a charming home!--my new one; a fine great house, with\npictures, and delicate decorations, and rich furniture, and no gloom\nanywhere, but all the wilderness of dainty colors lit up with flooding\nsunshine; and the spacious grounds around it, and the great garden--oh,\ngreensward, and noble trees, and flowers, no end! And I was the same as\na member of the family; and they loved me, and petted me, and did not\ngive me a new name, but called me by my old one that was dear to me\nbecause my mother had given it me--Aileen Mavoureen. She got it out of a\nsong; and the Grays knew that song, and said it was a beautiful name.\n\nMrs. Gray was thirty, and so sweet and so lovely, you cannot imagine\nit; and Sadie was ten, and just like her mother, just a darling slender\nlittle copy of her, with auburn tails down her back, and short frocks;\nand the baby was a year old, and plump and dimpled, and fond of me,\nand never could get enough of hauling on my tail, and hugging me, and\nlaughing out its innocent happiness; and Mr. Gray was thirty-eight, and\ntall and slender and handsome, a little bald in front, alert, quick in\nhis movements, business-like, prompt, decided, unsentimental, and with\nthat kind of trim-chiseled face that just seems to glint and sparkle\nwith frosty intellectuality! He was a renowned scientist. I do not know\nwhat the word means, but my mother would know how to use it and get\neffects. She would know how to depress a rat-terrier with it and make a\nlap-dog look sorry he came. But that is not the best one; the best one\nwas Laboratory. My mother could organize a Trust on that one that would\nskin the tax-collars off the whole herd. The laboratory was not a\nbook, or a picture, or a place to wash your hands in, as the college\npresident's dog said--no, that is the lavatory; the laboratory is quite\ndifferent, and is filled with jars, and bottles, and electrics, and\nwires, and strange machines; and every week other scientists came there\nand sat in the place, and used the machines, and discussed, and made\nwhat they called experiments and discoveries; and often I came, too,\nand stood around and listened, and tried to learn, for the sake of my\nmother, and in loving memory of her, although it was a pain to me, as\nrealizing what she was losing out of her life and I gaining nothing at\nall; for try as I might, I was never able to make anything out of it at\nall.\n\nOther times I lay on the floor in the mistress's work-room and slept,\nshe gently using me for a foot-stool, knowing it pleased me, for it\nwas a caress; other times I spent an hour in the nursery, and got well\ntousled and made happy; other times I watched by the crib there, when\nthe baby was asleep and the nurse out for a few minutes on the baby's\naffairs; other times I romped and raced through the grounds and the\ngarden with Sadie till we were tired out, then slumbered on the grass in\nthe shade of a tree while she read her book; other times I went visiting\namong the neighbor dogs--for there were some most pleasant ones not\nfar away, and one very handsome and courteous and graceful one,\na curly-haired Irish setter by the name of Robin Adair, who was a\nPresbyterian like me, and belonged to the Scotch minister.\n\nThe servants in our house were all kind to me and were fond of me, and\nso, as you see, mine was a pleasant life. There could not be a happier\ndog that I was, nor a gratefuler one. I will say this for myself, for it\nis only the truth: I tried in all ways to do well and right, and honor\nmy mother's memory and her teachings, and earn the happiness that had\ncome to me, as best I could.\n\nBy and by came my little puppy, and then my cup was full, my happiness\nwas perfect. It was the dearest little waddling thing, and so smooth\nand soft and velvety, and had such cunning little awkward paws, and such\naffectionate eyes, and such a sweet and innocent face; and it made me\nso proud to see how the children and their mother adored it, and fondled\nit, and exclaimed over every little wonderful thing it did. It did seem\nto me that life was just too lovely to--\n\nThen came the winter. One day I was standing a watch in the nursery.\nThat is to say, I was asleep on the bed. The baby was asleep in the\ncrib, which was alongside the bed, on the side next the fireplace. It\nwas the kind of crib that has a lofty tent over it made of gauzy stuff\nthat you can see through. The nurse was out, and we two sleepers were\nalone. A spark from the wood-fire was shot out, and it lit on the slope\nof the tent. I suppose a quiet interval followed, then a scream from the\nbaby awoke me, and there was that tent flaming up toward the ceiling!\nBefore I could think, I sprang to the floor in my fright, and in a\nsecond was half-way to the door; but in the next half-second my mother's\nfarewell was sounding in my ears, and I was back on the bed again.,\nI reached my head through the flames and dragged the baby out by the\nwaist-band, and tugged it along, and we fell to the floor together in a\ncloud of smoke; I snatched a new hold, and dragged the screaming little\ncreature along and out at the door and around the bend of the hall,\nand was still tugging away, all excited and happy and proud, when the\nmaster's voice shouted:\n\n“Begone you cursed beast!” and I jumped to save myself; but he was\nfuriously quick, and chased me up, striking furiously at me with his\ncane, I dodging this way and that, in terror, and at last a strong\nblow fell upon my left foreleg, which made me shriek and fall, for\nthe moment, helpless; the cane went up for another blow, but never\ndescended, for the nurse's voice rang wildly out, “The nursery's on\nfire!” and the master rushed away in that direction, and my other bones\nwere saved.\n\nThe pain was cruel, but, no matter, I must not lose any time; he might\ncome back at any moment; so I limped on three legs to the other end\nof the hall, where there was a dark little stairway leading up into a\ngarret where old boxes and such things were kept, as I had heard say,\nand where people seldom went. I managed to climb up there, then I\nsearched my way through the dark among the piles of things, and hid in\nthe secretest place I could find. It was foolish to be afraid there, yet\nstill I was; so afraid that I held in and hardly even whimpered, though\nit would have been such a comfort to whimper, because that eases the\npain, you know. But I could lick my leg, and that did some good.\n\nFor half an hour there was a commotion downstairs, and shoutings,\nand rushing footsteps, and then there was quiet again. Quiet for some\nminutes, and that was grateful to my spirit, for then my fears began\nto go down; and fears are worse than pains--oh, much worse. Then came a\nsound that froze me. They were calling me--calling me by name--hunting\nfor me!\n\nIt was muffled by distance, but that could not take the terror out of\nit, and it was the most dreadful sound to me that I had ever heard. It\nwent all about, everywhere, down there: along the halls, through all\nthe rooms, in both stories, and in the basement and the cellar; then\noutside, and farther and farther away--then back, and all about the\nhouse again, and I thought it would never, never stop. But at last it\ndid, hours and hours after the vague twilight of the garret had long ago\nbeen blotted out by black darkness.\n\nThen in that blessed stillness my terrors fell little by little away,\nand I was at peace and slept. It was a good rest I had, but I woke\nbefore the twilight had come again. I was feeling fairly comfortable,\nand I could think out a plan now. I made a very good one; which was, to\ncreep down, all the way down the back stairs, and hide behind the cellar\ndoor, and slip out and escape when the iceman came at dawn, while he was\ninside filling the refrigerator; then I would hide all day, and start\non my journey when night came; my journey to--well, anywhere where they\nwould not know me and betray me to the master. I was feeling almost\ncheerful now; then suddenly I thought: Why, what would life be without\nmy puppy!\n\nThat was despair. There was no plan for me; I saw that; I must say where\nI was; stay, and wait, and take what might come--it was not my affair;\nthat was what life is--my mother had said it. Then--well, then the\ncalling began again! All my sorrows came back. I said to myself, the\nmaster will never forgive. I did not know what I had done to make him so\nbitter and so unforgiving, yet I judged it was something a dog could not\nunderstand, but which was clear to a man and dreadful.\n\nThey called and called--days and nights, it seemed to me. So long that\nthe hunger and thirst near drove me mad, and I recognized that I was\ngetting very weak. When you are this way you sleep a great deal, and I\ndid. Once I woke in an awful fright--it seemed to me that the calling\nwas right there in the garret! And so it was: it was Sadie's voice,\nand she was crying; my name was falling from her lips all broken, poor\nthing, and I could not believe my ears for the joy of it when I heard\nher say:\n\n“Come back to us--oh, come back to us, and forgive--it is all so sad\nwithout our--”\n\nI broke in with _such _a grateful little yelp, and the next moment\nSadie was plunging and stumbling through the darkness and the lumber and\nshouting for the family to hear, “She's found, she's found!”\n\nThe days that followed--well, they were wonderful. The mother and Sadie\nand the servants--why, they just seemed to worship me. They couldn't\nseem to make me a bed that was fine enough; and as for food, they\ncouldn't be satisfied with anything but game and delicacies that were\nout of season; and every day the friends and neighbors flocked in to\nhear about my heroism--that was the name they called it by, and it\nmeans agriculture. I remember my mother pulling it on a kennel once, and\nexplaining it in that way, but didn't say what agriculture was, except\nthat it was synonymous with intramural incandescence; and a dozen times\na day Mrs. Gray and Sadie would tell the tale to new-comers, and say I\nrisked my life to save the baby's, and both of us had burns to prove it,\nand then the company would pass me around and pet me and exclaim about\nme, and you could see the pride in the eyes of Sadie and her mother; and\nwhen the people wanted to know what made me limp, they looked ashamed\nand changed the subject, and sometimes when people hunted them this way\nand that way with questions about it, it looked to me as if they were\ngoing to cry.\n\nAnd this was not all the glory; no, the master's friends came, a whole\ntwenty of the most distinguished people, and had me in the laboratory,\nand discussed me as if I was a kind of discovery; and some of them said\nit was wonderful in a dumb beast, the finest exhibition of instinct they\ncould call to mind; but the master said, with vehemence, “It's far above\ninstinct; it's _reason_, and many a man, privileged to be saved and go\nwith you and me to a better world by right of its possession, has less\nof it that this poor silly quadruped that's foreordained to perish”; and\nthen he laughed, and said: “Why, look at me--I'm a sarcasm! bless you,\nwith all my grand intelligence, the only thing I inferred was that\nthe dog had gone mad and was destroying the child, whereas but for the\nbeast's intelligence--it's _reason_, I tell you!--the child would have\nperished!”\n\nThey disputed and disputed, and _I_ was the very center of subject of it\nall, and I wished my mother could know that this grand honor had come to\nme; it would have made her proud.\n\nThen they discussed optics, as they called it, and whether a certain\ninjury to the brain would produce blindness or not, but they could not\nagree about it, and said they must test it by experiment by and by;\nand next they discussed plants, and that interested me, because in the\nsummer Sadie and I had planted seeds--I helped her dig the holes, you\nknow--and after days and days a little shrub or a flower came up there,\nand it was a wonder how that could happen; but it did, and I wished I\ncould talk--I would have told those people about it and shown then how\nmuch I knew, and been all alive with the subject; but I didn't care for\nthe optics; it was dull, and when they came back to it again it bored\nme, and I went to sleep.\n\nPretty soon it was spring, and sunny and pleasant and lovely, and the\nsweet mother and the children patted me and the puppy good-by, and went\naway on a journey and a visit to their kin, and the master wasn't any\ncompany for us, but we played together and had good times, and the\nservants were kind and friendly, so we got along quite happily and\ncounted the days and waited for the family.\n\nAnd one day those men came again, and said, now for the test, and they\ntook the puppy to the laboratory, and I limped three-leggedly along,\ntoo, feeling proud, for any attention shown to the puppy was a pleasure\nto me, of course. They discussed and experimented, and then suddenly the\npuppy shrieked, and they set him on the floor, and he went staggering\naround, with his head all bloody, and the master clapped his hands and\nshouted:\n\n“There, I've won--confess it! He's a blind as a bat!”\n\nAnd they all said:\n\n“It's so--you've proved your theory, and suffering humanity owes you a\ngreat debt from henceforth,” and they crowded around him, and wrung his\nhand cordially and thankfully, and praised him.\n\nBut I hardly saw or heard these things, for I ran at once to my little\ndarling, and snuggled close to it where it lay, and licked the blood,\nand it put its head against mine, whimpering softly, and I knew in\nmy heart it was a comfort to it in its pain and trouble to feel its\nmother's touch, though it could not see me. Then it dropped down,\npresently, and its little velvet nose rested upon the floor, and it was\nstill, and did not move any more.\n\nSoon the master stopped discussing a moment, and rang in the footman,\nand said, “Bury it in the far corner of the garden,” and then went on\nwith the discussion, and I trotted after the footman, very happy and\ngrateful, for I knew the puppy was out of its pain now, because it\nwas asleep. We went far down the garden to the farthest end, where the\nchildren and the nurse and the puppy and I used to play in the summer in\nthe shade of a great elm, and there the footman dug a hole, and I saw he\nwas going to plant the puppy, and I was glad, because it would grow\nand come up a fine handsome dog, like Robin Adair, and be a beautiful\nsurprise for the family when they came home; so I tried to help him dig,\nbut my lame leg was no good, being stiff, you know, and you have to have\ntwo, or it is no use. When the footman had finished and covered little\nRobin up, he patted my head, and there were tears in his eyes, and he\nsaid: “Poor little doggie, you saved _his _child!”\n\nI have watched two whole weeks, and he doesn't come up! This last week\na fright has been stealing upon me. I think there is something terrible\nabout this. I do not know what it is, but the fear makes me sick, and I\ncannot eat, though the servants bring me the best of food; and they pet\nme so, and even come in the night, and cry, and say, “Poor doggie--do\ngive it up and come home; _don't_ break our hearts!” and all this\nterrifies me the more, and makes me sure something has happened. And\nI am so weak; since yesterday I cannot stand on my feet anymore. And\nwithin this hour the servants, looking toward the sun where it was\nsinking out of sight and the night chill coming on, said things I could\nnot understand, but they carried something cold to my heart.\n\n“Those poor creatures! They do not suspect. They will come home in the\nmorning, and eagerly ask for the little doggie that did the brave deed,\nand who of us will be strong enough to say the truth to them: 'The\nhumble little friend is gone where go the beasts that perish.'”\n\n\n\nWAS IT HEAVEN? OR HELL?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n“You told a _lie_?”\n\n“You confess it--you actually confess it--you told a lie!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe family consisted of four persons: Margaret Lester, widow, aged\nthirty six; Helen Lester, her daughter, aged sixteen; Mrs. Lester's\nmaiden aunts, Hannah and Hester Gray, twins, aged sixty-seven. Waking\nand sleeping, the three women spent their days and nights in adoring the\nyoung girl; in watching the movements of her sweet spirit in the mirror\nof her face; in refreshing their souls with the vision of her bloom\nand beauty; in listening to the music of her voice; in gratefully\nrecognizing how rich and fair for them was the world with this presence\nin it; in shuddering to think how desolate it would be with this light\ngone out of it.\n\nBy nature--and inside--the aged aunts were utterly dear and lovable and\ngood, but in the matter of morals and conduct their training had been so\nuncompromisingly strict that it had made them exteriorly austere, not to\nsay stern. Their influence was effective in the house; so effective\nthat the mother and the daughter conformed to its moral and religious\nrequirements cheerfully, contentedly, happily, unquestionably. To do\nthis was become second nature to them. And so in this peaceful\nheaven there were no clashings, no irritations, no fault-finding, no\nheart-burnings.\n\nIn it a lie had no place. In it a lie was unthinkable. In it speech\nwas restricted to absolute truth, iron-bound truth, implacable and\nuncompromising truth, let the resulting consequences be what they might.\nAt last, one day, under stress of circumstances, the darling of the\nhouse sullied her lips with a lie--and confessed it, with tears\nand self-upbraidings. There are not any words that can paint the\nconsternation of the aunts. It was as if the sky had crumpled up and\ncollapsed and the earth had tumbled to ruin with a crash. They sat side\nby side, white and stern, gazing speechless upon the culprit, who was on\nher knees before them with her face buried first in one lap and then the\nother, moaning and sobbing, and appealing for sympathy and forgiveness\nand getting no response, humbly kissing the hand of the one, then of the\nother, only to see it withdrawn as suffering defilement by those soiled\nlips.\n\nTwice, at intervals, Aunt Hester said, in frozen amazement:\n\n“You told a _lie_?”\n\nTwice, at intervals, Aunt Hannah followed with the muttered and amazed\nejaculation:\n\n“You confess it--you actually confess it--you told a lie!”\n\nIt was all they could say. The situation was new, unheard of,\nincredible; they could not understand it, they did not know how to take\nhold of it, it approximately paralyzed speech.\n\nAt length it was decided that the erring child must be taken to her\nmother, who was ill, and who ought to know what had happened. Helen\nbegged, besought, implored that she might be spared this further\ndisgrace, and that her mother might be spared the grief and pain of\nit; but this could not be: duty required this sacrifice, duty takes\nprecedence of all things, nothing can absolve one from a duty, with a\nduty no compromise is possible.\n\nHelen still begged, and said the sin was her own, her mother had had no\nhand in it--why must she be made to suffer for it?\n\nBut the aunts were obdurate in their righteousness, and said the law\nthat visited the sins of the parent upon the child was by all right\nand reason reversible; and therefore it was but just that the innocent\nmother of a sinning child should suffer her rightful share of the grief\nand pain and shame which were the allotted wages of the sin.\n\nThe three moved toward the sick-room.\n\nAt this time the doctor was approaching the house. He was still a good\ndistance away, however. He was a good doctor and a good man, and he had\na good heart, but one had to know him a year to get over hating him, two\nyears to learn to endure him, three to learn to like him, and four and\nfive to learn to love him. It was a slow and trying education, but it\npaid. He was of great stature; he had a leonine head, a leonine face, a\nrough voice, and an eye which was sometimes a pirate's and sometimes\na woman's, according to the mood. He knew nothing about etiquette, and\ncared nothing about it; in speech, manner, carriage, and conduct he was\nthe reverse of conventional. He was frank, to the limit; he had opinions\non all subjects; they were always on tap and ready for delivery, and he\ncared not a farthing whether his listener liked them or didn't. Whom\nhe loved he loved, and manifested it; whom he didn't love he hated, and\npublished it from the housetops. In his young days he had been a sailor,\nand the salt-airs of all the seas blew from him yet. He was a sturdy and\nloyal Christian, and believed he was the best one in the land, and the\nonly one whose Christianity was perfectly sound, healthy, full-charged\nwith common sense, and had no decayed places in it. People who had an ax\nto grind, or people who for any reason wanted to get on the soft side\nof him, called him The Christian--a phrase whose delicate flattery was\nmusic to his ears, and whose capital T was such an enchanting and vivid\nobject to him that he could _see _it when it fell out of a person's\nmouth even in the dark. Many who were fond of him stood on their\nconsciences with both feet and brazenly called him by that large title\nhabitually, because it was a pleasure to them to do anything that\nwould please him; and with eager and cordial malice his extensive and\ndiligently cultivated crop of enemies gilded it, beflowered it, expanded\nit to “The _only _Christian.” Of these two titles, the latter had the\nwider currency; the enemy, being greatly in the majority, attended to\nthat. Whatever the doctor believed, he believed with all his heart,\nand would fight for it whenever he got the chance; and if the intervals\nbetween chances grew to be irksomely wide, he would invent ways of\nshortening them himself. He was severely conscientious, according to\nhis rather independent lights, and whatever he took to be a duty he\nperformed, no matter whether the judgment of the professional moralists\nagreed with his own or not. At sea, in his young days, he had used\nprofanity freely, but as soon as he was converted he made a rule, which\nhe rigidly stuck to ever afterward, never to use it except on the rarest\noccasions, and then only when duty commanded. He had been a hard\ndrinker at sea, but after his conversion he became a firm and outspoken\nteetotaler, in order to be an example to the young, and from that time\nforth he seldom drank; never, indeed, except when it seemed to him to be\na duty--a condition which sometimes occurred a couple of times a year,\nbut never as many as five times.\n\nNecessarily, such a man is impressionable, impulsive, emotional. This\none was, and had no gift at hiding his feelings; or if he had it he took\nno trouble to exercise it. He carried his soul's prevailing weather in\nhis face, and when he entered a room the parasols or the umbrellas went\nup--figuratively speaking--according to the indications. When the soft\nlight was in his eye it meant approval, and delivered a benediction;\nwhen he came with a frown he lowered the temperature ten degrees. He was\na well-beloved man in the house of his friends, but sometimes a dreaded\none.\n\nHe had a deep affection for the Lester household and its several members\nreturned this feeling with interest. They mourned over his kind of\nChristianity, and he frankly scoffed at theirs; but both parties went on\nloving each other just the same.\n\nHe was approaching the house--out of the distance; the aunts and the\nculprit were moving toward the sick-chamber.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe three last named stood by the bed; the aunts austere, the\ntransgressor softly sobbing. The mother turned her head on the pillow;\nher tired eyes flamed up instantly with sympathy and passionate\nmother-love when they fell upon her child, and she opened the refuge and\nshelter of her arms.\n\n“Wait!” said Aunt Hannah, and put out her hand and stayed the girl from\nleaping into them.\n\n“Helen,” said the other aunt, impressively, “tell your mother all. Purge\nyour soul; leave nothing unconfessed.”\n\nStanding stricken and forlorn before her judges, the young girl mourned\nher sorrowful tale through the end, then in a passion of appeal cried\nout:\n\n“Oh, mother, can't you forgive me? won't you forgive me?--I am so\ndesolate!”\n\n“Forgive you, my darling? Oh, come to my arms!--there, lay your head\nupon my breast, and be at peace. If you had told a thousand lies--”\n\nThere was a sound--a warning--the clearing of a throat. The aunts\nglanced up, and withered in their clothes--there stood the doctor, his\nface a thunder-cloud. Mother and child knew nothing of his presence;\nthey lay locked together, heart to heart, steeped in immeasurable\ncontent, dead to all things else. The physician stood many moments\nglaring and glooming upon the scene before him; studying it, analyzing\nit, searching out its genesis; then he put up his hand and beckoned to\nthe aunts. They came trembling to him, and stood humbly before him and\nwaited. He bent down and whispered:\n\n“Didn't I tell you this patient must be protected from all excitement?\nWhat the hell have you been doing? Clear out of the place!”\n\nThey obeyed. Half an hour later he appeared in the parlor, serene,\ncheery, clothed in sunshine, conducting Helen, with his arm about her\nwaist, petting her, and saying gentle and playful things to her; and she\nalso was her sunny and happy self again.\n\n“Now, then;” he said, “good-by, dear. Go to your room, and keep away\nfrom your mother, and behave yourself. But wait--put out your tongue.\nThere, that will do--you're as sound as a nut!” He patted her cheek and\nadded, “Run along now; I want to talk to these aunts.”\n\nShe went from the presence. His face clouded over again at once; and as\nhe sat down he said:\n\n“You too have been doing a lot of damage--and maybe some good. Some\ngood, yes--such as it is. That woman's disease is typhoid! You've\nbrought it to a show-up, I think, with your insanities, and that's a\nservice--such as it is. I hadn't been able to determine what it was\nbefore.”\n\nWith one impulse the old ladies sprang to their feet, quaking with\nterror.\n\n“Sit down! What are you proposing to do?”\n\n“Do? We must fly to her. We--”\n\n“You'll do nothing of the kind; you've done enough harm for one day. Do\nyou want to squander all your capital of crimes and follies on a single\ndeal? Sit down, I tell you. I have arranged for her to sleep; she needs\nit; if you disturb her without my orders, I'll brain you--if you've got\nthe materials for it.”\n\nThey sat down, distressed and indignant, but obedient, under compulsion.\nHe proceeded:\n\n“Now, then, I want this case explained. _They _wanted to explain it to\nme--as if there hadn't been emotion or excitement enough already. You\nknew my orders; how did you dare to go in there and get up that riot?”\n\nHester looked appealing at Hannah; Hannah returned a beseeching look\nat Hester--neither wanted to dance to this unsympathetic orchestra. The\ndoctor came to their help. He said:\n\n“Begin, Hester.”\n\nFingering at the fringes of her shawl, and with lowered eyes, Hester\nsaid, timidly:\n\n“We should not have disobeyed for any ordinary cause, but this was\nvital. This was a duty. With a duty one has no choice; one must put all\nlighter considerations aside and perform it. We were obliged to arraign\nher before her mother. She had told a lie.”\n\nThe doctor glowered upon the woman a moment, and seemed to be trying\nto work up in his mind an understanding of a wholly incomprehensible\nproposition; then he stormed out:\n\n“She told a lie! _did _she? God bless my soul! I tell a million a day!\nAnd so does every doctor. And so does everybody--including you--for\nthat matter. And _that _was the important thing that authorized you to\nventure to disobey my orders and imperil that woman's life! Look here,\nHester Gray, this is pure lunacy; that girl _couldn't_ tell a lie that\nwas intended to injure a person. The thing is impossible--absolutely\nimpossible. You know it yourselves--both of you; you know it perfectly\nwell.”\n\nHannah came to her sister's rescue:\n\n“Hester didn't mean that it was that kind of a lie, and it wasn't. But\nit was a lie.”\n\n“Well, upon my word, I never heard such nonsense! Haven't you got sense\nenough to discriminate between lies! Don't you know the difference\nbetween a lie that helps and a lie that hurts?”\n\n“_All _lies are sinful,” said Hannah, setting her lips together like a\nvise; “all lies are forbidden.”\n\nThe Only Christian fidgeted impatiently in his chair. He went to attack\nthis proposition, but he did not quite know how or where to begin.\nFinally he made a venture:\n\n“Hester, wouldn't you tell a lie to shield a person from an undeserved\ninjury or shame?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Not even a friend?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Not even your dearest friend?”\n\n“No. I would not.”\n\nThe doctor struggled in silence awhile with this situation; then he\nasked:\n\n“Not even to save him from bitter pain and misery and grief?”\n\n“No. Not even to save his life.”\n\nAnother pause. Then:\n\n“Nor his soul?”\n\nThere was a hush--a silence which endured a measurable interval--then\nHester answered, in a low voice, but with decision:\n\n“Nor his soul?”\n\nNo one spoke for a while; then the doctor said:\n\n“Is it with you the same, Hannah?”\n\n“Yes,” she answered.\n\n“I ask you both--why?”\n\n“Because to tell such a lie, or any lie, is a sin, and could cost us\nthe loss of our own souls--_would_, indeed, if we died without time to\nrepent.”\n\n“Strange... strange... it is past belief.” Then he asked, roughly: “Is\nsuch a soul as that _worth _saving?” He rose up, mumbling and grumbling,\nand started for the door, stumping vigorously along. At the threshold he\nturned and rasped out an admonition: “Reform! Drop this mean and sordid\nand selfish devotion to the saving of your shabby little souls, and hunt\nup something to do that's got some dignity to it! _Risk _your souls!\nrisk them in good causes; then if you lose them, why should you care?\nReform!”\n\nThe good old gentlewomen sat paralyzed, pulverized, outraged, insulted,\nand brooded in bitterness and indignation over these blasphemies. They\nwere hurt to the heart, poor old ladies, and said they could never\nforgive these injuries.\n\n“Reform!”\n\nThey kept repeating that word resentfully. “Reform--and learn to tell\nlies!”\n\nTime slipped along, and in due course a change came over their spirits.\nThey had completed the human being's first duty--which is to think about\nhimself until he has exhausted the subject, then he is in a condition\nto take up minor interests and think of other people. This changes the\ncomplexion of his spirits--generally wholesomely. The minds of the two\nold ladies reverted to their beloved niece and the fearful disease which\nhad smitten her; instantly they forgot the hurts their self-love had\nreceived, and a passionate desire rose in their hearts to go to the help\nof the sufferer and comfort her with their love, and minister to\nher, and labor for her the best they could with their weak hands, and\njoyfully and affectionately wear out their poor old bodies in her dear\nservice if only they might have the privilege.\n\n“And we shall have it!” said Hester, with the tears running down her\nface. “There are no nurses comparable to us, for there are no others\nthat will stand their watch by that bed till they drop and die, and God\nknows we would do that.”\n\n“Amen,” said Hannah, smiling approval and endorsement through the mist\nof moisture that blurred her glasses. “The doctor knows us, and knows we\nwill not disobey again; and he will call no others. He will not dare!”\n\n“Dare?” said Hester, with temper, and dashing the water from her eyes;\n“he will dare anything--that Christian devil! But it will do no good for\nhim to try it this time--but, laws! Hannah! after all's said and\ndone, he is gifted and wise and good, and he would not think of such a\nthing.... It is surely time for one of us to go to that room. What is\nkeeping him? Why doesn't he come and say so?”\n\nThey caught the sound of his approaching step. He entered, sat down, and\nbegan to talk.\n\n“Margaret is a sick woman,” he said. “She is still sleeping, but she\nwill wake presently; then one of you must go to her. She will be worse\nbefore she is better. Pretty soon a night-and-day watch must be set. How\nmuch of it can you two undertake?”\n\n“All of it!” burst from both ladies at once.\n\nThe doctor's eyes flashed, and he said, with energy:\n\n“You _do_ ring true, you brave old relics! And you _shall _do all of the\nnursing you can, for there's none to match you in that divine office in\nthis town; but you can't do all of it, and it would be a crime to let\nyou.” It was grand praise, golden praise, coming from such a source, and\nit took nearly all the resentment out of the aged twin's hearts. “Your\nTilly and my old Nancy shall do the rest--good nurses both, white souls\nwith black skins, watchful, loving, tender--just perfect nurses!--and\ncompetent liars from the cradle.... Look you! keep a little watch on\nHelen; she is sick, and is going to be sicker.”\n\nThe ladies looked a little surprised, and not credulous; and Hester\nsaid:\n\n“How is that? It isn't an hour since you said she was as sound as a\nnut.”\n\nThe doctor answered, tranquilly:\n\n“It was a lie.”\n\nThe ladies turned upon him indignantly, and Hannah said:\n\n“How can you make an odious confession like that, in so indifferent a\ntone, when you know how we feel about all forms of--”\n\n“Hush! You are as ignorant as cats, both of you, and you don't know what\nyou are talking about. You are like all the rest of the moral moles;\nyou lie from morning till night, but because you don't do it with your\nmouths, but only with your lying eyes, your lying inflections, your\ndeceptively misplaced emphasis, and your misleading gestures, you turn\nup your complacent noses and parade before God and the world as saintly\nand unsmirched Truth-Speakers, in whose cold-storage souls a lie would\nfreeze to death if it got there! Why will you humbug yourselves with\nthat foolish notion that no lie is a lie except a spoken one? What is\nthe difference between lying with your eyes and lying with your mouth?\nThere is none; and if you would reflect a moment you would see that it\nis so. There isn't a human being that doesn't tell a gross of lies every\nday of his life; and you--why, between you, you tell thirty thousand;\nyet you flare up here in a lurid hypocritical horror because I tell that\nchild a benevolent and sinless lie to protect her from her imagination,\nwhich would get to work and warm up her blood to a fever in an hour, if\nI were disloyal enough to my duty to let it. Which I should probably do\nif I were interested in saving my soul by such disreputable means.\n\n“Come, let us reason together. Let us examine details. When you two were\nin the sick-room raising that riot, what would you have done if you had\nknown I was coming?”\n\n“Well, what?”\n\n“You would have slipped out and carried Helen with you--wouldn't you?”\n\nThe ladies were silent.\n\n“What would be your object and intention?”\n\n“Well, what?”\n\n“To keep me from finding out your guilt; to beguile me to infer that\nMargaret's excitement proceeded from some cause not known to you. In a\nword, to tell me a lie--a silent lie. Moreover, a possibly harmful one.”\n\nThe twins colored, but did not speak.\n\n“You not only tell myriads of silent lies, but you tell lies with your\nmouths--you two.”\n\n“_That _is not so!”\n\n“It is so. But only harmless ones. You never dream of uttering a harmful\none. Do you know that that is a concession--and a confession?”\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\n“It is an unconscious concession that harmless lies are not criminal;\nit is a confession that you constantly _make _that discrimination. For\ninstance, you declined old Mrs. Foster's invitation last week to meet\nthose odious Higbies at supper--in a polite note in which you expressed\nregret and said you were very sorry you could not go. It was a lie.\nIt was as unmitigated a lie as was ever uttered. Deny it, Hester--with\nanother lie.”\n\nHester replied with a toss of her head.\n\n“That will not do. Answer. Was it a lie, or wasn't it?”\n\nThe color stole into the cheeks of both women, and with a struggle and\nan effort they got out their confession:\n\n“It was a lie.”\n\n“Good--the reform is beginning; there is hope for you yet; you will not\ntell a lie to save your dearest friend's soul, but you will spew out\none without a scruple to save yourself the discomfort of telling an\nunpleasant truth.”\n\nHe rose. Hester, speaking for both, said; coldly:\n\n“We have lied; we perceive it; it will occur no more. To lie is a sin.\nWe shall never tell another one of any kind whatsoever, even lies of\ncourtesy or benevolence, to save any one a pang or a sorrow decreed for\nhim by God.”\n\n“Ah, how soon you will fall! In fact, you have fallen already; for what\nyou have just uttered is a lie. Good-by. Reform! One of you go to the\nsick-room now.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTwelve days later.\n\nMother and child were lingering in the grip of the hideous disease.\nOf hope for either there was little. The aged sisters looked white\nand worn, but they would not give up their posts. Their hearts\nwere breaking, poor old things, but their grit was steadfast and\nindestructible. All the twelve days the mother had pined for the child,\nand the child for the mother, but both knew that the prayer of these\nlongings could not be granted. When the mother was told--on the first\nday--that her disease was typhoid, she was frightened, and asked if\nthere was danger that Helen could have contracted it the day before,\nwhen she was in the sick-chamber on that confession visit. Hester told\nher the doctor had poo-pooed the idea. It troubled Hester to say it,\nalthough it was true, for she had not believed the doctor; but when\nshe saw the mother's joy in the news, the pain in her conscience\nlost something of its force--a result which made her ashamed of the\nconstructive deception which she had practiced, though not ashamed\nenough to make her distinctly and definitely wish she had refrained from\nit. From that moment the sick woman understood that her daughter must\nremain away, and she said she would reconcile herself to the separation\nthe best she could, for she would rather suffer death than have her\nchild's health imperiled. That afternoon Helen had to take to her bed,\nill. She grew worse during the night. In the morning her mother asked\nafter her:\n\n“Is she well?”\n\nHester turned cold; she opened her lips, but the words refused to come.\nThe mother lay languidly looking, musing, waiting; suddenly she turned\nwhite and gasped out:\n\n“Oh, my God! what is it? is she sick?”\n\nThen the poor aunt's tortured heart rose in rebellion, and words came:\n\n“No--be comforted; she is well.”\n\nThe sick woman put all her happy heart in her gratitude:\n\n“Thank God for those dear words! Kiss me. How I worship you for saying\nthem!”\n\nHester told this incident to Hannah, who received it with a rebuking\nlook, and said, coldly:\n\n“Sister, it was a lie.”\n\nHester's lips trembled piteously; she choked down a sob, and said:\n\n“Oh, Hannah, it was a sin, but I could not help it. I could not endure\nthe fright and the misery that were in her face.”\n\n“No matter. It was a lie. God will hold you to account for it.”\n\n“Oh, I know it, I know it,” cried Hester, wringing her hands, “but even\nif it were now, I could not help it. I know I should do it again.”\n\n“Then take my place with Helen in the morning. I will make the report\nmyself.”\n\nHester clung to her sister, begging and imploring.\n\n“Don't, Hannah, oh, don't--you will kill her.”\n\n“I will at least speak the truth.”\n\nIn the morning she had a cruel report to bear to the mother, and she\nbraced herself for the trial. When she returned from her mission, Hester\nwas waiting, pale and trembling, in the hall. She whispered:\n\n“Oh, how did she take it--that poor, desolate mother?”\n\nHannah's eyes were swimming in tears. She said:\n\n“God forgive me, I told her the child was well!”\n\nHester gathered her to her heart, with a grateful “God bless you,\nHannah!” and poured out her thankfulness in an inundation of worshiping\npraises.\n\nAfter that, the two knew the limit of their strength, and accepted their\nfate. They surrendered humbly, and abandoned themselves to the hard\nrequirements of the situation. Daily they told the morning lie, and\nconfessed their sin in prayer; not asking forgiveness, as not being\nworthy of it, but only wishing to make record that they realized their\nwickedness and were not desiring to hide it or excuse it.\n\nDaily, as the fair young idol of the house sank lower and lower, the\nsorrowful old aunts painted her glowing bloom and her fresh young beauty\nto the wan mother, and winced under the stabs her ecstasies of joy and\ngratitude gave them.\n\nIn the first days, while the child had strength to hold a pencil, she\nwrote fond little love-notes to her mother, in which she concealed her\nillness; and these the mother read and reread through happy eyes wet\nwith thankful tears, and kissed them over and over again, and treasured\nthem as precious things under her pillow.\n\nThen came a day when the strength was gone from the hand, and the mind\nwandered, and the tongue babbled pathetic incoherences. This was a sore\ndilemma for the poor aunts. There were no love-notes for the mother.\nThey did not know what to do. Hester began a carefully studied and\nplausible explanation, but lost the track of it and grew confused;\nsuspicion began to show in the mother's face, then alarm. Hester saw it,\nrecognized the imminence of the danger, and descended to the emergency,\npulling herself resolutely together and plucking victory from the open\njaws of defeat. In a placid and convincing voice she said:\n\n“I thought it might distress you to know it, but Helen spent the night\nat the Sloanes'. There was a little party there, and, although she did\nnot want to go, and you so sick, we persuaded her, she being young\nand needing the innocent pastimes of youth, and we believing you would\napprove. Be sure she will write the moment she comes.”\n\n“How good you are, and how dear and thoughtful for us both! Approve?\nWhy, I thank you with all my heart. My poor little exile! Tell her I\nwant her to have every pleasure she can--I would not rob her of one.\nOnly let her keep her health, that is all I ask. Don't let that\nsuffer; I could not bear it. How thankful I am that she escaped this\ninfection--and what a narrow risk she ran, Aunt Hester! Think of that\nlovely face all dulled and burned with fever. I can't bear the thought\nof it. Keep her health. Keep her bloom! I can see her now, the dainty\ncreature--with the big, blue, earnest eyes; and sweet, oh, so sweet and\ngentle and winning! Is she as beautiful as ever, dear Aunt Hester?”\n\n“Oh, more beautiful and bright and charming than ever she was before,\nif such a thing can be”--and Hester turned away and fumbled with the\nmedicine-bottles, to hide her shame and grief.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nAfter a little, both aunts were laboring upon a difficult and baffling\nwork in Helen's chamber. Patiently and earnestly, with their stiff old\nfingers, they were trying to forge the required note. They made failure\nafter failure, but they improved little by little all the time. The\npity of it all, the pathetic humor of it, there was none to see; they\nthemselves were unconscious of it. Often their tears fell upon the notes\nand spoiled them; sometimes a single misformed word made a note risky\nwhich could have been ventured but for that; but at last Hannah produced\none whose script was a good enough imitation of Helen's to pass any but\na suspicious eye, and bountifully enriched it with the petting phrases\nand loving nicknames that had been familiar on the child's lips from her\nnursery days. She carried it to the mother, who took it with avidity,\nand kissed it, and fondled it, reading its precious words over and over\nagain, and dwelling with deep contentment upon its closing paragraph:\n\n“Mousie darling, if I could only see you, and kiss your eyes, and feel\nyour arms about me! I am so glad my practicing does not disturb you. Get\nwell soon. Everybody is good to me, but I am so lonesome without you,\ndear mamma.”\n\n“The poor child, I know just how she feels. She cannot be quite happy\nwithout me; and I--oh, I live in the light of her eyes! Tell her she\nmust practice all she pleases; and, Aunt Hannah--tell her I can't hear\nthe piano this far, nor her dear voice when she sings: God knows I wish\nI could. No one knows how sweet that voice is to me; and to think--some\nday it will be silent! What are you crying for?”\n\n“Only because--because--it was just a memory. When I came away she was\nsinging, 'Loch Lomond.' The pathos of it! It always moves me so when she\nsings that.”\n\n“And me, too. How heartbreakingly beautiful it is when some youthful\nsorrow is brooding in her breast and she sings it for the mystic healing\nit brings.... Aunt Hannah?”\n\n“Dear Margaret?”\n\n“I am very ill. Sometimes it comes over me that I shall never hear that\ndear voice again.”\n\n“Oh, don't--don't, Margaret! I can't bear it!”\n\nMargaret was moved and distressed, and said, gently:\n\n“There--there--let me put my arms around you. Don't cry. There--put your\ncheek to mine. Be comforted. I wish to live. I will live if I can. Ah,\nwhat could she do without me!... Does she often speak of me?--but I know\nshe does.”\n\n“Oh, all the time--all the time!”\n\n“My sweet child! She wrote the note the moment she came home?”\n\n“Yes--the first moment. She would not wait to take off her things.”\n\n“I knew it. It is her dear, impulsive, affectionate way. I knew it\nwithout asking, but I wanted to hear you say it. The petted wife knows\nshe is loved, but she makes her husband tell her so every day, just for\nthe joy of hearing it.... She used the pen this time. That is better;\nthe pencil-marks could rub out, and I should grieve for that. Did you\nsuggest that she use the pen?”\n\n“Y--no--she--it was her own idea.”\n\nThe mother looked her pleasure, and said:\n\n“I was hoping you would say that. There was never such a dear and\nthoughtful child!... Aunt Hannah?”\n\n“Dear Margaret?”\n\n“Go and tell her I think of her all the time, and worship her. Why--you\nare crying again. Don't be so worried about me, dear; I think there is\nnothing to fear, yet.”\n\nThe grieving messenger carried her message, and piously delivered it\nto unheeding ears. The girl babbled on unaware; looking up at her with\nwondering and startled eyes flaming with fever, eyes in which was no\nlight of recognition:\n\n“Are you--no, you are not my mother. I want her--oh, I want her! She was\nhere a minute ago--I did not see her go. Will she come? will she come\nquickly? will she come now?... There are so many houses ... and they\noppress me so... and everything whirls and turns and whirls... oh, my\nhead, my head!”--and so she wandered on and on, in her pain, flitting\nfrom one torturing fancy to another, and tossing her arms about in a\nweary and ceaseless persecution of unrest.\n\nPoor old Hannah wetted the parched lips and softly stroked the hot brow,\nmurmuring endearing and pitying words, and thanking the Father of all\nthat the mother was happy and did not know.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nDaily the child sank lower and steadily lower towards the grave, and\ndaily the sorrowing old watchers carried gilded tidings of her radiant\nhealth and loveliness to the happy mother, whose pilgrimage was also now\nnearing its end. And daily they forged loving and cheery notes in the\nchild's hand, and stood by with remorseful consciences and bleeding\nhearts, and wept to see the grateful mother devour them and adore them\nand treasure them away as things beyond price, because of their sweet\nsource, and sacred because her child's hand had touched them.\n\nAt last came that kindly friend who brings healing and peace to all.\nThe lights were burning low. In the solemn hush which precedes the dawn\nvague figures flitted soundless along the dim hall and gathered silent\nand awed in Helen's chamber, and grouped themselves about her bed, for\na warning had gone forth, and they knew. The dying girl lay with closed\nlids, and unconscious, the drapery upon her breast faintly rising and\nfalling as her wasting life ebbed away. At intervals a sigh or a muffled\nsob broke upon the stillness. The same haunting thought was in all minds\nthere: the pity of this death, the going out into the great darkness,\nand the mother not here to help and hearten and bless.\n\nHelen stirred; her hands began to grope wistfully about as if they\nsought something--she had been blind some hours. The end was come; all\nknew it. With a great sob Hester gathered her to her breast, crying,\n“Oh, my child, my darling!” A rapturous light broke in the dying girl's\nface, for it was mercifully vouchsafed her to mistake those sheltering\narms for another's; and she went to her rest murmuring, “Oh, mamma, I am\nso happy--I longed for you--now I can die.”\n\nTwo hours later Hester made her report. The mother asked:\n\n“How is it with the child?”\n\n“She is well.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA sheaf of white crape and black was hung upon the door of the house,\nand there it swayed and rustled in the wind and whispered its tidings.\nAt noon the preparation of the dead was finished, and in the coffin lay\nthe fair young form, beautiful, and in the sweet face a great peace. Two\nmourners sat by it, grieving and worshipping--Hannah and the black woman\nTilly. Hester came, and she was trembling, for a great trouble was upon\nher spirit. She said:\n\n“She asks for a note.”\n\nHannah's face blanched. She had not thought of this; it had seemed that\nthat pathetic service was ended. But she realized now that that could\nnot be. For a little while the two women stood looking into each other's\nface, with vacant eyes; then Hannah said:\n\n“There is no way out of it--she must have it; she will suspect, else.”\n\n“And she would find out.”\n\n“Yes. It would break her heart.” She looked at the dead face, and her\neyes filled. “I will write it,” she said.\n\nHester carried it. The closing line said:\n\n“Darling Mousie, dear sweet mother, we shall soon be together again. Is\nnot that good news? And it is true; they all say it is true.”\n\nThe mother mourned, saying:\n\n“Poor child, how will she bear it when she knows? I shall never see her\nagain in life. It is hard, so hard. She does not suspect? You guard her\nfrom that?”\n\n“She thinks you will soon be well.”\n\n“How good you are, and careful, dear Aunt Hester! None goes near her who\ncould carry the infection?”\n\n“It would be a crime.”\n\n“But you _see _her?”\n\n“With a distance between--yes.”\n\n“That is so good. Others one could not trust; but you two guardian\nangels--steel is not so true as you. Others would be unfaithful; and\nmany would deceive, and lie.”\n\nHester's eyes fell, and her poor old lips trembled.\n\n“Let me kiss you for her, Aunt Hester; and when I am gone, and the\ndanger is past, place the kiss upon her dear lips some day, and say her\nmother sent it, and all her mother's broken heart is in it.”\n\nWithin the hour, Hester, raining tears upon the dead face, performed her\npathetic mission.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nAnother day dawned, and grew, and spread its sunshine in the earth. Aunt\nHannah brought comforting news to the failing mother, and a happy note,\nwhich said again, “We have but a little time to wait, darling mother,\nthen we shall be together.”\n\nThe deep note of a bell came moaning down the wind.\n\n“Aunt Hannah, it is tolling. Some poor soul is at rest. As I shall be\nsoon. You will not let her forget me?”\n\n“Oh, God knows she never will!”\n\n“Do not you hear strange noises, Aunt Hannah? It sounds like the\nshuffling of many feet.”\n\n“We hoped you would not hear it, dear. It is a little company gathering,\nfor--for Helen's sake, poor little prisoner. There will be music--and\nshe loves it so. We thought you would not mind.”\n\n“Mind? Oh no, no--oh, give her everything her dear heart can desire. How\ngood you two are to her, and how good to me! God bless you both always!”\n\nAfter a listening pause:\n\n“How lovely! It is her organ. Is she playing it herself, do you think?”\n Faint and rich and inspiring the chords floating to her ears on the\nstill air. “Yes, it is her touch, dear heart, I recognize it. They are\nsinging. Why--it is a hymn! and the sacredest of all, the most touching,\nthe most consoling.... It seems to open the gates of paradise to me....\nIf I could die now....”\n\nFaint and far the words rose out of the stillness:\n\n\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\n\nNearer to Thee,\n\nE'en though it be a cross\n\nThat raiseth me.\n\nWith the closing of the hymn another soul passed to its rest, and they\nthat had been one in life were not sundered in death. The sisters,\nmourning and rejoicing, said:\n\n“How blessed it was that she never knew!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nAt midnight they sat together, grieving, and the angel of the Lord\nappeared in the midst transfigured with a radiance not of earth; and\nspeaking, said:\n\n“For liars a place is appointed. There they burn in the fires of hell\nfrom everlasting unto everlasting. Repent!”\n\nThe bereaved fell upon their knees before him and clasped their hands\nand bowed their gray heads, adoring. But their tongues clove to the roof\nof their mouths, and they were dumb.\n\n“Speak! that I may bear the message to the chancery of heaven and bring\nagain the decree from which there is no appeal.”\n\nThen they bowed their heads yet lower, and one said:\n\n“Our sin is great, and we suffer shame; but only perfect and final\nrepentance can make us whole; and we are poor creatures who have learned\nour human weakness, and we know that if we were in those hard straits\nagain our hearts would fail again, and we should sin as before. The\nstrong could prevail, and so be saved, but we are lost.”\n\nThey lifted their heads in supplication. The angel was gone. While\nthey marveled and wept he came again; and bending low, he whispered the\ndecree.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nWas it Heaven? Or Hell?\n\n\n\nA CURE FOR THE BLUES\n\nBy courtesy of Mr. Cable I came into possession of a singular book\neight or ten years ago. It is likely that mine is now the only copy in\nexistence. Its title-page, unabbreviated, reads as follows:\n\n“The Enemy Conquered; or, Love Triumphant. By G. Ragsdale McClintock,\n(1) author of 'An Address,' etc., delivered at Sunflower Hill, South\nCarolina, and member of the Yale Law School. New Haven: published by T.\nH. Pease, 83 Chapel Street, 1845.”\n\nNo one can take up this book and lay it down again unread. Whoever reads\none line of it is caught, is chained; he has become the contented slave\nof its fascinations; and he will read and read, devour and devour, and\nwill not let it go out of his hand till it is finished to the last line,\nthough the house be on fire over his head. And after a first reading he\nwill not throw it aside, but will keep it by him, with his Shakespeare\nand his Homer, and will take it up many and many a time, when the\nworld is dark and his spirits are low, and be straightway cheered and\nrefreshed. Yet this work has been allowed to lie wholly neglected,\nunmentioned, and apparently unregretted, for nearly half a century.\n\nThe reader must not imagine that he is to find in it wisdom, brilliancy,\nfertility of invention, ingenuity of construction, excellence of form,\npurity of style, perfection of imagery, truth to nature, clearness of\nstatement, humanly possible situations, humanly possible people, fluent\nnarrative, connected sequence of events--or philosophy, or logic, or\nsense. No; the rich, deep, beguiling charm of the book lies in the total\nand miraculous _absence _from it of all these qualities--a charm which\nis completed and perfected by the evident fact that the author, whose\nnaive innocence easily and surely wins our regard, and almost our\nworship, does not know that they are absent, does not even suspect\nthat they are absent. When read by the light of these helps to an\nunderstanding of the situation, the book is delicious--profoundly and\nsatisfyingly delicious.\n\nI call it a book because the author calls it a book, I call it a work\nbecause he calls it a work; but, in truth, it is merely a duodecimo\npamphlet of thirty-one pages. It was written for fame and money, as the\nauthor very frankly--yes, and very hopefully, too, poor fellow--says\nin his preface. The money never came--no penny of it ever came; and how\nlong, how pathetically long, the fame has been deferred--forty-seven\nyears! He was young then, it would have been so much to him then; but\nwill he care for it now?\n\nAs time is measured in America, McClintock's epoch is antiquity. In his\nlong-vanished day the Southern author had a passion for “eloquence”;\nit was his pet, his darling. He would be eloquent, or perish. And he\nrecognized only one kind of eloquence--the lurid, the tempestuous, the\nvolcanic. He liked words--big words, fine words, grand words, rumbling,\nthundering, reverberating words; with sense attaching if it could be got\nin without marring the sound, but not otherwise. He loved to stand\nup before a dazed world, and pour forth flame and smoke and lava and\npumice-stone into the skies, and work his subterranean thunders, and\nshake himself with earthquakes, and stench himself with sulphur fumes.\nIf he consumed his own fields and vineyards, that was a pity, yes; but\nhe would have his eruption at any cost. Mr. McClintock's eloquence--and\nhe is always eloquent, his crater is always spouting--is of the pattern\ncommon to his day, but he departs from the custom of the time in one\nrespect: his brethren allowed sense to intrude when it did not mar the\nsound, but he does not allow it to intrude at all. For example, consider\nthis figure, which he used in the village “Address” referred to with\nsuch candid complacency in the title-page above quoted--“like the\ntopmost topaz of an ancient tower.” Please read it again; contemplate\nit; measure it; walk around it; climb up it; try to get at an\napproximate realization of the size of it. Is the fellow to that to be\nfound in literature, ancient or modern, foreign or domestic, living or\ndead, drunk or sober? One notices how fine and grand it sounds. We know\nthat if it was loftily uttered, it got a noble burst of applause from\nthe villagers; yet there isn't a ray of sense in it, or meaning to it.\n\nMcClintock finished his education at Yale in 1843, and came to Hartford\non a visit that same year. I have talked with men who at that time\ntalked with him, and felt of him, and knew he was real. One needs to\nremember that fact and to keep fast hold of it; it is the only way to\nkeep McClintock's book from undermining one's faith in McClintock's\nactuality.\n\nAs to the book. The first four pages are devoted to an inflamed\neulogy of Woman--simply Woman in general, or perhaps as an\nInstitution--wherein, among other compliments to her details, he pays a\nunique one to her voice. He says it “fills the breast with fond alarms,\nechoed by every rill.” It sounds well enough, but it is not true. After\nthe eulogy he takes up his real work and the novel begins. It begins in\nthe woods, near the village of Sunflower Hill.\n\nBrightening clouds seemed to rise from the mist of the fair\nChattahoochee, to spread their beauty over the thick forest, to guide\nthe hero whose bosom beats with aspirations to conquer the enemy that\nwould tarnish his name, and to win back the admiration of his long-tried\nfriend.\n\nIt seems a general remark, but it is not general; the hero mentioned is\nthe to-be hero of the book; and in this abrupt fashion, and without\nname or description, he is shoveled into the tale. “With aspirations to\nconquer the enemy that would tarnish his name” is merely a phrase flung\nin for the sake of the sound--let it not mislead the reader. No one is\ntrying to tarnish this person; no one has thought of it. The rest of the\nsentence is also merely a phrase; the man has no friend as yet, and\nof course has had no chance to try him, or win back his admiration, or\ndisturb him in any other way.\n\nThe hero climbs up over “Sawney's Mountain,” and down the other side,\nmaking for an old Indian “castle”--which becomes “the red man's hut”\n in the next sentence; and when he gets there at last, he “surveys with\nwonder and astonishment” the invisible structure, “which time has buried\nin the dust, and thought to himself his happiness was not yet complete.”\n One doesn't know why it wasn't, nor how near it came to being complete,\nnor what was still wanting to round it up and make it so. Maybe it was\nthe Indian; but the book does not say. At this point we have an episode:\n\nBeside the shore of the brook sat a young man, about eighteen or twenty,\nwho seemed to be reading some favorite book, and who had a remarkably\nnoble countenance--eyes which betrayed more than a common mind. This\nof course made the youth a welcome guest, and gained him friends in\nwhatever condition of his life he might be placed. The traveler observed\nthat he was a well-built figure which showed strength and grace in every\nmovement. He accordingly addressed him in quite a gentlemanly manner,\nand inquired of him the way to the village. After he had received the\ndesired information, and was about taking his leave, the youth said,\n“Are you not Major Elfonzo, the great musician (2)--the champion of a\nnoble cause--the modern Achilles, who gained so many victories in the\nFlorida War?” “I bear that name,” said the Major, “and those titles,\ntrusting at the same time that the ministers of grace will carry me\ntriumphantly through all my laudable undertakings, and if,” continued\nthe Major, “you, sir, are the patronizer of noble deeds, I should like\nto make you my confidant and learn your address.” The youth looked\nsomewhat amazed, bowed low, mused for a moment, and began: “My name is\nRoswell. I have been recently admitted to the bar, and can only give a\nfaint outline of my future success in that honorable profession; but I\ntrust, sir, like the Eagle, I shall look down from the lofty rocks upon\nthe dwellings of man, and shall ever be ready to give you any assistance\nin my official capacity, and whatever this muscular arm of mine can\ndo, whenever it shall be called from its buried _greatness_.” The Major\ngrasped him by the hand, and exclaimed: “O! thou exalted spirit of\ninspiration--thou flame of burning prosperity, may the Heaven-directed\nblaze be the glare of thy soul, and battle down every rampart that seems\nto impede your progress!”\n\nThere is a strange sort of originality about McClintock; he imitates\nother people's styles, but nobody can imitate his, not even an idiot.\nOther people can be windy, but McClintock blows a gale; other people can\nblubber sentiment, but McClintock spews it; other people can mishandle\nmetaphors, but only McClintock knows how to make a business of it.\nMcClintock is always McClintock, he is always consistent, his style is\nalways his own style. He does not make the mistake of being relevant on\none page and irrelevant on another; he is irrelevant on all of them.\nHe does not make the mistake of being lucid in one place and obscure\nin another; he is obscure all the time. He does not make the mistake\nof slipping in a name here and there that is out of character with\nhis work; he always uses names that exactly and fantastically fit his\nlunatics. In the matter of undeviating consistency he stands alone in\nauthorship. It is this that makes his style unique, and entitles it to\na name of its own--McClintockian. It is this that protects it from being\nmistaken for anybody else's. Uncredited quotations from other writers\noften leave a reader in doubt as to their authorship, but McClintock is\nsafe from that accident; an uncredited quotation from him would always\nbe recognizable. When a boy nineteen years old, who had just been\nadmitted to the bar, says, “I trust, sir, like the Eagle, I shall\nlook down from lofty rocks upon the dwellings of man,” we know who is\nspeaking through that boy; we should recognize that note anywhere. There\nbe myriads of instruments in this world's literary orchestra, and a\nmultitudinous confusion of sounds that they make, wherein fiddles\nare drowned, and guitars smothered, and one sort of drum mistaken\nfor another sort; but whensoever the brazen note of the McClintockian\ntrombone breaks through that fog of music, that note is recognizable,\nand about it there can be no blur of doubt.\n\nThe novel now arrives at the point where the Major goes home to see his\nfather. When McClintock wrote this interview he probably believed it was\npathetic.\n\nThe road which led to the town presented many attractions Elfonzo had\nbid farewell to the youth of deep feeling, and was now wending his way\nto the dreaming spot of his fondness. The south winds whistled through\nthe woods, as the waters dashed against the banks, as rapid fire in the\npent furnace roars. This brought him to remember while alone, that he\nquietly left behind the hospitality of a father's house, and gladly\nentered the world, with higher hopes than are often realized. But as he\njourneyed onward, he was mindful of the advice of his father, who had\noften looked sadly on the ground, when tears of cruelly deceived hope\nmoistened his eyes. Elfonzo had been somewhat a dutiful son; yet fond\nof the amusements of life--had been in distant lands--had enjoyed the\npleasure of the world, and had frequently returned to the scenes of\nhis boyhood, almost destitute of many of the comforts of life. In this\ncondition, he would frequently say to his father, “Have I offended you,\nthat you look upon me as a stranger, and frown upon me with stinging\nlooks? Will you not favor me with the sound of your voice? If I have\ntrampled upon your veneration, or have spread a humid veil of darkness\naround your expectations, send me back into the world, where no heart\nbeats for me--where the foot of man had never yet trod; but give me at\nleast one kind word--allow me to come into the presence sometimes of\nthy winter-worn locks.” “Forbid it, Heaven, that I should be angry with\nthee,” answered the father, “my son, and yet I send thee back to the\nchildren of the world--to the cold charity of the combat, and to a\nland of victory. I read another destiny in thy countenance--I learn\nthy inclinations from the flame that has already kindled in my soul a\nstrange sensation. It will seek thee, my dear _Elfonzo_, it will find\nthee--thou canst not escape that lighted torch, which shall blot out\nfrom the remembrance of men a long train of prophecies which they have\nforetold against thee. I once thought not so. Once, I was blind; but\nnow the path of life is plain before me, and my sight is clear; yet,\nElfonzo, return to thy worldly occupation--take again in thy hand that\nchord of sweet sounds--struggle with the civilized world and with your\nown heart; fly swiftly to the enchanted ground--let the night-_owl_ send\nforth its screams from the stubborn oak--let the sea sport upon the\nbeach, and the stars sing together; but learn of these, Elfonzo, thy\ndoom, and thy hiding-place. Our most innocent as well as our most lawful\n_desires_ must often be denied us, that we may learn to sacrifice them\nto a Higher will.”\n\nRemembering such admonitions with gratitude, Elfonzo was immediately\nurged by the recollection of his father's family to keep moving.\n\nMcClintock has a fine gift in the matter of surprises; but as a rule\nthey are not pleasant ones, they jar upon the feelings. His closing\nsentence in the last quotation is of that sort. It brings one down out\nof the tinted clouds in too sudden and collapsed a fashion. It incenses\none against the author for a moment. It makes the reader want to take\nhim by his winter-worn locks, and trample on his veneration, and deliver\nhim over to the cold charity of combat, and blot him out with his own\nlighted torch. But the feeling does not last. The master takes again\nin his hand that concord of sweet sounds of his, and one is reconciled,\npacified.\n\nHis steps became quicker and quicker--he hastened through the _piny_\nwoods, dark as the forest was, and with joy he very soon reached the\nlittle village of repose, in whose bosom rested the boldest chivalry.\nHis close attention to every important object--his modest questions\nabout whatever was new to him--his reverence for wise old age, and his\nardent desire to learn many of the fine arts, soon brought him into\nrespectable notice.\n\nOne mild winter day, as he walked along the streets toward the Academy,\nwhich stood upon a small eminence, surrounded by native growth--some\nvenerable in its appearance, others young and prosperous--all seemed\ninviting, and seemed to be the very place for learning as well as for\ngenius to spend its research beneath its spreading shades. He entered\nits classic walls in the usual mode of southern manners.\n\nThe artfulness of this man! None knows so well as he how to pique the\ncuriosity of the reader--and how to disappoint it. He raises the hope,\nhere, that he is going to tell all about how one enters a classic wall\nin the usual mode of Southern manners; but does he? No; he smiles in his\nsleeve, and turns aside to other matters.\n\nThe principal of the Institution begged him to be seated and listen to\nthe recitations that were going on. He accordingly obeyed the request,\nand seemed to be much pleased. After the school was dismissed, and the\nyoung hearts regained their freedom, with the songs of the evening,\nlaughing at the anticipated pleasures of a happy home, while others\ntittered at the actions of the past day, he addressed the teacher in a\ntone that indicated a resolution--with an undaunted mind. He said he had\ndetermined to become a student, if he could meet with his approbation.\n“Sir,” said he, “I have spent much time in the world. I have traveled\namong the uncivilized inhabitants of America. I have met with friends,\nand combated with foes; but none of these gratify my ambition, or decide\nwhat is to be my destiny. I see the learned world have an influence\nwith the voice of the people themselves. The despoilers of the remotest\nkingdoms of the earth refer their differences to this class of persons.\nThis the illiterate and inexperienced little dream of; and now if you\nwill receive me as I am, with these deficiencies--with all my misguided\nopinions, I will give you my honor, sir, that I will never disgrace the\nInstitution, or those who have placed you in this honorable station.”\n The instructor, who had met with many disappointments, knew how to\nfeel for a stranger who had been thus turned upon the charities of an\nunfeeling community. He looked at him earnestly, and said: “Be of\ngood cheer--look forward, sir, to the high destination you may attain.\nRemember, the more elevated the mark at which you aim, the more sure,\nthe more glorious, the more magnificent the prize.” From wonder to\nwonder, his encouragement led the impatient listener. A strange nature\nbloomed before him--giant streams promised him success--gardens of\nhidden treasures opened to his view. All this, so vividly described,\nseemed to gain a new witchery from his glowing fancy.\n\nIt seems to me that this situation is new in romance. I feel sure it has\nnot been attempted before. Military celebrities have been disguised and\nset at lowly occupations for dramatic effect, but I think McClintock is\nthe first to send one of them to school. Thus, in this book, you pass\nfrom wonder to wonder, through gardens of hidden treasure, where giant\nstreams bloom before you, and behind you, and all around, and you feel\nas happy, and groggy, and satisfied with your quart of mixed metaphor\naboard as you would if it had been mixed in a sample-room and delivered\nfrom a jug.\n\nNow we come upon some more McClintockian surprises--a sweetheart who is\nsprung upon us without any preparation, along with a name for her which\nis even a little more of a surprise than she herself is.\n\nIn 1842 he entered the class, and made rapid progress in the English\nand Latin departments. Indeed, he continued advancing with such rapidity\nthat he was like to become the first in his class, and made such\nunexpected progress, and was so studious, that he had almost forgotten\nthe pictured saint of his affections. The fresh wreaths of the pine and\ncypress had waited anxiously to drop once more the dews of Heaven upon\nthe heads of those who had so often poured forth the tender emotions of\ntheir souls under its boughs. He was aware of the pleasure that he had\nseen there. So one evening, as he was returning from his reading, he\nconcluded he would pay a visit to this enchanting spot. Little did he\nthink of witnessing a shadow of his former happiness, though no doubt\nhe wished it might be so. He continued sauntering by the roadside,\nmeditating on the past. The nearer he approached the spot, the more\nanxious he became. At that moment a tall female figure flitted across\nhis path, with a bunch of roses in her hand; her countenance showed\nuncommon vivacity, with a resolute spirit; her ivory teeth already\nappeared as she smiled beautifully, promenading--while her ringlets of\nhair dangled unconsciously around her snowy neck. Nothing was wanting\nto complete her beauty. The tinge of the rose was in full bloom upon\nher cheek; the charms of sensibility and tenderness were always her\nassociates. In Ambulinia's bosom dwelt a noble soul--one that never\nfaded--one that never was conquered.\n\nAmbulinia! It can hardly be matched in fiction. The full name is\nAmbulinia Valeer. Marriage will presently round it out and perfect it.\nThen it will be Mrs. Ambulinia Valeer Elfonzo. It takes the chromo.\n\nHer heart yielded to no feeling but the love of Elfonzo, on whom she\ngazed with intense delight, and to whom she felt herself more closely\nbound, because he sought the hand of no other. Elfonzo was roused\nfrom his apparent reverie. His books no longer were his inseparable\ncompanions--his thoughts arrayed themselves to encourage him to the\nfield of victory. He endeavored to speak to his supposed Ambulinia, but\nhis speech appeared not in words. No, his effort was a stream of fire,\nthat kindled his soul into a flame of admiration, and carried his senses\naway captive. Ambulinia had disappeared, to make him more mindful of\nhis duty. As she walked speedily away through the piny woods, she calmly\nechoed: “O! Elfonzo, thou wilt now look from thy sunbeams. Thou shalt\nnow walk in a new path--perhaps thy way leads through darkness; but fear\nnot, the stars foretell happiness.”\n\nTo McClintock that jingling jumble of fine words meant something, no\ndoubt, or seemed to mean something; but it is useless for us to try to\ndivine what it was. Ambulinia comes--we don't know whence nor why; she\nmysteriously intimates--we don't know what; and then she goes echoing\naway--we don't know whither; and down comes the curtain. McClintock's\nart is subtle; McClintock's art is deep.\n\nNot many days afterward, as surrounded by fragrant flowers she sat one\nevening at twilight, to enjoy the cool breeze that whispered notes of\nmelody along the distant groves, the little birds perched on every\nside, as if to watch the movements of their new visitor. The bells were\ntolling, when Elfonzo silently stole along by the wild wood flowers,\nholding in his hand his favorite instrument of music--his eye\ncontinually searching for Ambulinia, who hardly seemed to perceive him,\nas she played carelessly with the songsters that hopped from branch to\nbranch. Nothing could be more striking than the difference between the\ntwo. Nature seemed to have given the more tender soul to Elfonzo, and\nthe stronger and more courageous to Ambulinia. A deep feeling spoke from\nthe eyes of Elfonzo--such a feeling as can only be expressed by those\nwho are blessed as admirers, and by those who are able to return the\nsame with sincerity of heart. He was a few years older than Ambulinia:\nshe had turned a little into her seventeenth. He had almost grown up\nin the Cherokee country, with the same equal proportions as one of the\nnatives. But little intimacy had existed between them until the year\nforty-one--because the youth felt that the character of such a lovely\ngirl was too exalted to inspire any other feeling than that of quiet\nreverence. But as lovers will not always be insulted, at all times and\nunder all circumstances, by the frowns and cold looks of crabbed old\nage, which should continually reflect dignity upon those around, and\ntreat the unfortunate as well as the fortunate with a graceful mien, he\ncontinued to use diligence and perseverance. All this lighted a spark\nin his heart that changed his whole character, and like the unyielding\nDeity that follows the storm to check its rage in the forest, he\nresolves for the first time to shake off his embarrassment and return\nwhere he had before only worshiped.\n\nAt last we begin to get the Major's measure. We are able to put this\nand that casual fact together, and build the man up before our eyes,\nand look at him. And after we have got him built, we find him worth the\ntrouble. By the above comparison between his age and Ambulinia's, we\nguess the war-worn veteran to be twenty-two; and the other facts stand\nthus: he had grown up in the Cherokee country with the same equal\nproportions as one of the natives--how flowing and graceful the\nlanguage, and yet how tantalizing as to meaning!--he had been turned\nadrift by his father, to whom he had been “somewhat of a dutiful son”;\nhe wandered in distant lands; came back frequently “to the scenes of his\nboyhood, almost destitute of many of the comforts of life,” in order to\nget into the presence of his father's winter-worn locks, and spread\na humid veil of darkness around his expectations; but he was always\npromptly sent back to the cold charity of the combat again; he learned\nto play the fiddle, and made a name for himself in that line; he had\ndwelt among the wild tribes; he had philosophized about the despoilers\nof the kingdoms of the earth, and found out--the cunning creature--that\nthey refer their differences to the learned for settlement; he had\nachieved a vast fame as a military chieftain, the Achilles of the\nFlorida campaigns, and then had got him a spelling-book and started\nto school; he had fallen in love with Ambulinia Valeer while she was\nteething, but had kept it to himself awhile, out of the reverential awe\nwhich he felt for the child; but now at last, like the unyielding Deity\nwho follows the storm to check its rage in the forest, he resolves to\nshake off his embarrassment, and to return where before he had only\nworshiped. The Major, indeed, has made up his mind to rise up and shake\nhis faculties together, and to see if_ he_ can't do that thing himself.\nThis is not clear. But no matter about that: there stands the hero,\ncompact and visible; and he is no mean structure, considering that his\ncreator had never created anything before, and hadn't anything but\nrags and wind to build with this time. It seems to me that no one can\ncontemplate this odd creature, this quaint and curious blatherskite,\nwithout admiring McClintock, or, at any rate, loving him and feeling\ngrateful to him; for McClintock made him, he gave him to us; without\nMcClintock we could not have had him, and would now be poor.\n\nBut we must come to the feast again. Here is a courtship scene, down\nthere in the romantic glades among the raccoons, alligators, and things,\nthat has merit, peculiar literary merit. See how Achilles woos.\nDwell upon the second sentence (particularly the close of it) and the\nbeginning of the third. Never mind the new personage, Leos, who is\nintruded upon us unheralded and unexplained. That is McClintock's way;\nit is his habit; it is a part of his genius; he cannot help it; he never\ninterrupts the rush of his narrative to make introductions.\n\nIt could not escape Ambulinia's penetrating eye that he sought an\ninterview with her, which she as anxiously avoided, and assumed a more\ndistant calmness than before, seemingly to destroy all hope. After many\nefforts and struggles with his own person, with timid steps the Major\napproached the damsel, with the same caution as he would have done in\na field of battle. “Lady Ambulinia,” said he, trembling, “I have\nlong desired a moment like this. I dare not let it escape. I fear the\nconsequences; yet I hope your indulgence will at least hear my petition.\nCan you not anticipate what I would say, and what I am about to express?\nWill not you, like Minerva, who sprung from the brain of Jupiter,\nrelease me from thy winding chains or cure me--” “Say no more, Elfonzo,”\n answered Ambulinia, with a serious look, raising her hand as if she\nintended to swear eternal hatred against the whole world; “another\nlady in my place would have perhaps answered your question in bitter\ncoldness. I know not the little arts of my sex. I care but little for\nthe vanity of those who would chide me, and am unwilling as well as\nashamed to be guilty of anything that would lead you to think 'all is\nnot gold that glitters'; so be not rash in your resolution. It is better\nto repent now, than to do it in a more solemn hour. Yes, I know what you\nwould say. I know you have a costly gift for me--the noblest that man\ncan make--_your heart!_ You should not offer it to one so unworthy.\nHeaven, you know, has allowed my father's house to be made a house of\nsolitude, a home of silent obedience, which my parents say is more to\nbe admired than big names and high-sounding titles. Notwithstanding all\nthis, let me speak the emotions of an honest heart--allow me to say in\nthe fullness of my hopes that I anticipate better days. The bird may\nstretch its wings toward the sun, which it can never reach; and flowers\nof the field appear to ascend in the same direction, because they cannot\ndo otherwise; but man confides his complaints to the saints in whom he\nbelieves; for in their abodes of light they know no more sorrow. From\nyour confession and indicative looks, I must be that person; if so\ndeceive not yourself.”\n\nElfonzo replied, “Pardon me, my dear madam, for my frankness. I have\nloved you from my earliest days--everything grand and beautiful hath\nborne the image of Ambulinia; while precipices on every hand surrounded\nme, your _guardian angel_ stood and beckoned me away from the deep\nabyss. In every trial, in every misfortune, I have met with your helping\nhand; yet I never dreamed or dared to cherish thy love, till a voice\nimpaired with age encouraged the cause, and declared they who acquired\nthy favor should win a victory. I saw how Leos worshiped thee. I felt my\nown unworthiness. I began to _know jealously_, a strong guest--indeed,\nin my bosom,--yet I could see if I gained your admiration Leos was to be\nmy rival. I was aware that he had the influence of your parents, and the\nwealth of a deceased relative, which is too often mistaken for permanent\nand regular tranquillity; yet I have determined by your permission\nto beg an interest in your prayers--to ask you to animate my drooping\nspirits by your smiles and your winning looks; for if you but speak I\nshall be conqueror, my enemies shall stagger like Olympus shakes. And\nthough earth and sea may tremble, and the charioteer of the sun may\nforget his dashing steed, yet I am assured that it is only to arm me\nwith divine weapons which will enable me to complete my long-tried\nintention.”\n\n“Return to yourself, Elfonzo,” said Ambulinia, pleasantly: “a dream\nof vision has disturbed your intellect; you are above the atmosphere,\ndwelling in the celestial regions; nothing is there that urges or\nhinders, nothing that brings discord into our present litigation. I\nentreat you to condescend a little, and be a man, and forget it all.\nWhen Homer describes the battle of the gods and noble men fighting with\ngiants and dragons, they represent under this image our struggles with\nthe delusions of our passions. You have exalted me, an unhappy girl, to\nthe skies; you have called me a saint, and portrayed in your imagination\nan angel in human form. Let her remain such to you, let her continue to\nbe as you have supposed, and be assured that she will consider a share\nin your esteem as her highest treasure. Think not that I would allure\nyou from the path in which your conscience leads you; for you know I\nrespect the conscience of others, as I would die for my own. Elfonzo, if\nI am worthy of thy love, let such conversation never again pass between\nus. Go, seek a nobler theme! we will seek it in the stream of time, as\nthe sun set in the Tigris.” As she spake these words she grasped the\nhand of Elfonzo, saying at the same time--“Peace and prosperity\nattend you, my hero; be up and doing!” Closing her remarks with this\nexpression, she walked slowly away, leaving Elfonzo astonished and\namazed. He ventured not to follow or detain her. Here he stood alone,\ngazing at the stars; confounded as he was, here he stood.\n\nYes; there he stood. There seems to be no doubt about that. Nearly half\nof this delirious story has now been delivered to the reader. It seems a\npity to reduce the other half to a cold synopsis. Pity! it is more\nthan a pity, it is a crime; for to synopsize McClintock is to reduce\na sky-flushing conflagration to dull embers, it is to reduce barbaric\nsplendor to ragged poverty. McClintock never wrote a line that was not\nprecious; he never wrote one that could be spared; he never framed one\nfrom which a word could be removed without damage. Every sentence that\nthis master has produced may be likened to a perfect set of teeth,\nwhite, uniform, beautiful. If you pull one, the charm is gone.\n\nStill, it is now necessary to begin to pull, and to keep it up; for lack\nof space requires us to synopsize.\n\nWe left Elfonzo standing there amazed. At what, we do not know. Not at\nthe girl's speech. No; we ourselves should have been amazed at it,\nof course, for none of us has ever heard anything resembling it; but\nElfonzo was used to speeches made up of noise and vacancy, and could\nlisten to them with undaunted mind like the “topmost topaz of an ancient\ntower”; he was used to making them himself; he--but let it go, it cannot\nbe guessed out; we shall never know what it was that astonished him. He\nstood there awhile; then he said, “Alas! am I now Grief's disappointed\nson at last?” He did not stop to examine his mind, and to try to find\nout what he probably meant by that, because, for one reason, “a mixture\nof ambition and greatness of soul moved upon his young heart,” and\nstarted him for the village. He resumed his bench in school, “and\nreasonably progressed in his education.” His heart was heavy, but\nhe went into society, and sought surcease of sorrow in its light\ndistractions. He made himself popular with his violin, “which seemed to\nhave a thousand chords--more symphonious than the Muses of Apollo, and\nmore enchanting than the ghost of the Hills.” This is obscure, but let\nit go.\n\nDuring this interval Leos did some unencouraged courting, but at last,\n“choked by his undertaking,” he desisted.\n\nPresently “Elfonzo again wends his way to the stately walls and\nnew-built village.” He goes to the house of his beloved; she opens the\ndoor herself. To my surprise--for Ambulinia's heart had still seemed\nfree at the time of their last interview--love beamed from the girl's\neyes. One sees that Elfonzo was surprised, too; for when he caught that\nlight, “a halloo of smothered shouts ran through every vein.” A neat\nfigure--a very neat figure, indeed! Then he kissed her. “The scene was\noverwhelming.” They went into the parlor. The girl said it was safe,\nfor her parents were abed, and would never know. Then we have this\nfine picture--flung upon the canvas with hardly an effort, as you will\nnotice.\n\nAdvancing toward him, she gave a bright display of her rosy neck, and\nfrom her head the ambrosial locks breathed divine fragrance; her robe\nhung waving to his view, while she stood like a goddess confessed before\nhim.\n\nThere is nothing of interest in the couple's interview. Now at this\npoint the girl invites Elfonzo to a village show, where jealousy is the\nmotive of the play, for she wants to teach him a wholesome lesson, if he\nis a jealous person. But this is a sham, and pretty shallow. McClintock\nmerely wants a pretext to drag in a plagiarism of his upon a scene or\ntwo in “Othello.”\n\nThe lovers went to the play. Elfonzo was one of the fiddlers. He and\nAmbulinia must not be seen together, lest trouble follow with the girl's\nmalignant father; we are made to understand that clearly. So the two sit\ntogether in the orchestra, in the midst of the musicians. This does not\nseem to be good art. In the first place, the girl would be in the way,\nfor orchestras are always packed closely together, and there is no room\nto spare for people's girls; in the next place, one cannot conceal a\ngirl in an orchestra without everybody taking notice of it. There can be\nno doubt, it seems to me, that this is bad art.\n\nLeos is present. Of course, one of the first things that catches his eye\nis the maddening spectacle of Ambulinia “leaning upon Elfonzo's chair.”\n This poor girl does not seem to understand even the rudiments of\nconcealment. But she is “in her seventeenth,” as the author phrases it,\nand that is her justification.\n\nLeos meditates, constructs a plan--with personal violence as a basis,\nof course. It was their way down there. It is a good plain plan, without\nany imagination in it. He will go out and stand at the front door, and\nwhen these two come out he will “arrest Ambulinia from the hands of the\ninsolent Elfonzo,” and thus make for himself a “more prosperous field of\nimmortality than ever was decreed by Omnipotence, or ever pencil drew\nor artist imagined.” But, dear me, while he is waiting there the couple\nclimb out at the back window and scurry home! This is romantic enough,\nbut there is a lack of dignity in the situation.\n\nAt this point McClintock puts in the whole of his curious play--which we\nskip.\n\nSome correspondence follows now. The bitter father and the distressed\nlovers write the letters. Elopements are attempted. They are idiotically\nplanned, and they fail. Then we have several pages of romantic powwow\nand confusion signifying nothing. Another elopement is planned; it is to\ntake place on Sunday, when everybody is at church. But the “hero” cannot\nkeep the secret; he tells everybody. Another author would have found\nanother instrument when he decided to defeat this elopement; but that is\nnot McClintock's way. He uses the person that is nearest at hand.\n\nThe evasion failed, of course. Ambulinia, in her flight, takes refuge\nin a neighbor's house. Her father drags her home. The villagers gather,\nattracted by the racket.\n\nElfonzo was moved at this sight. The people followed on to see what was\ngoing to become of Ambulinia, while he, with downcast looks, kept at\na distance, until he saw them enter the abode of the father, thrusting\nher, that was the sigh of his soul, out of his presence into a solitary\napartment, when she exclaimed, “Elfonzo! Elfonzo! oh, Elfonzo! where\nart thou, with all thy heroes? haste, oh! haste, come thou to my relief.\nRide on the wings of the wind! Turn thy force loose like a tempest, and\nroll on thy army like a whirlwind, over this mountain of trouble and\nconfusion. Oh friends! if any pity me, let your last efforts throng upon\nthe green hills, and come to the relief of Ambulinia, who is guilty of\nnothing but innocent love.” Elfonzo called out with a loud voice, “My\nGod, can I stand this! arouse up, I beseech you, and put an end to this\ntyranny. Come, my brave boys,” said he, “are you ready to go forth to\nyour duty?” They stood around him. “Who,” said he, “will call us to\narms? Where are my thunderbolts of war? Speak ye, the first who will\nmeet the foe! Who will go forward with me in this ocean of grievous\ntemptation? If there is one who desires to go, let him come and shake\nhands upon the altar of devotion, and swear that he will be a hero; yes,\na Hector in a cause like this, which calls aloud for a speedy remedy.”\n “Mine be the deed,” said a young lawyer, “and mine alone; Venus alone\nshall quit her station before I will forsake one jot or tittle of my\npromise to you; what is death to me? what is all this warlike army,\nif it is not to win a victory? I love the sleep of the lover and the\nmighty; nor would I give it over till the blood of my enemies should\nwreak with that of my own. But God forbid that our fame should soar\non the blood of the slumberer.” Mr. Valeer stands at his door with the\nfrown of a demon upon his brow, with his dangerous weapon (3) ready to\nstrike the first man who should enter his door. “Who will arise and go\nforward through blood and carnage to the rescue of my Ambulinia?” said\nElfonzo. “All,” exclaimed the multitude; and onward they went, with\ntheir implements of battle. Others, of a more timid nature, stood among\nthe distant hills to see the result of the contest.\n\nIt will hardly be believed that after all this thunder and lightning not\na drop of rain fell; but such is the fact. Elfonzo and his gang stood up\nand black-guarded Mr. Valeer with vigor all night, getting their outlay\nback with interest; then in the early morning the army and its general\nretired from the field, leaving the victory with their solitary\nadversary and his crowbar. This is the first time this has happened in\nromantic literature. The invention is original. Everything in this book\nis original; there is nothing hackneyed about it anywhere. Always, in\nother romances, when you find the author leading up to a climax, you\nknow what is going to happen. But in this book it is different; the\nthing which seems inevitable and unavoidable never happens; it is\ncircumvented by the art of the author every time.\n\nAnother elopement was attempted. It failed.\n\nWe have now arrived at the end. But it is not exciting. McClintock\nthinks it is; but it isn't. One day Elfonzo sent Ambulinia another\nnote--a note proposing elopement No. 16. This time the plan is\nadmirable; admirable, sagacious, ingenious, imaginative, deep--oh,\neverything, and perfectly easy. One wonders why it was never thought of\nbefore. This is the scheme. Ambulinia is to leave the breakfast-table,\nostensibly to “attend to the placing of those flowers, which should have\nbeen done a week ago”--artificial ones, of course; the others wouldn't\nkeep so long--and then, instead of fixing the flowers, she is to walk\nout to the grove, and go off with Elfonzo. The invention of this plan\noverstrained the author that is plain, for he straightway shows failing\npowers. The details of the plan are not many or elaborate. The author\nshall state them himself--this good soul, whose intentions are always\nbetter than his English:\n\n“You walk carelessly toward the academy grove, where you will find me\nwith a lightning steed, elegantly equipped to bear you off where we\nshall be joined in wedlock with the first connubial rights.”\n\nLast scene of all, which the author, now much enfeebled, tries to\nsmarten up and make acceptable to his spectacular heart by introducing\nsome new properties--silver bow, golden harp, olive branch--things that\ncan all come good in an elopement, no doubt, yet are not to be compared\nto an umbrella for real handiness and reliability in an excursion of\nthat kind.\n\nAnd away she ran to the sacred grove, surrounded with glittering pearls,\nthat indicated her coming. Elfonzo hails her with his silver bow and his\ngolden harp. They meet--Ambulinia's countenance brightens--Elfonzo leads\nup the winged steed. “Mount,” said he, “ye true-hearted, ye fearless\nsoul--the day is ours.” She sprang upon the back of the young\nthunderbolt, a brilliant star sparkles upon her head, with one hand she\ngrasps the reins, and with the other she holds an olive branch. “Lend\nthy aid, ye strong winds,” they exclaimed, “ye moon, ye sun, and all ye\nfair host of heaven, witness the enemy conquered.” “Hold,” said Elfonzo,\n“thy dashing steed.” “Ride on,” said Ambulinia, “the voice of thunder is\nbehind us.” And onward they went, with such rapidity that they very soon\narrived at Rural Retreat, where they dismounted, and were united with\nall the solemnities that usually attended such divine operations.\n\nThere is but one Homer, there is but one Shakespeare, there is but one\nMcClintock--and his immortal book is before you. Homer could not have\nwritten this book, Shakespeare could not have written it, I could not\nhave done it myself. There is nothing just like it in the literature of\nany country or of any epoch. It stands alone; it is monumental. It\nadds G. Ragsdale McClintock's to the sum of the republic's imperishable\nnames.\n\n1. The name here given is a substitute for the one actually attached to\nthe pamphlet.\n\n2. Further on it will be seen that he is a country expert on the fiddle,\nand has a three-township fame.\n\n3. It is a crowbar.\n\n\n\nTHE CURIOUS BOOK\n\nCOMPLETE\n\n(The foregoing review of the great work of G. Ragsdale McClintock is\nliberally illuminated with sample extracts, but these cannot appease the\nappetite. Only the complete book, unabridged, can do that. Therefore it\nis here printed.--M.T.)\n\nTHE ENEMY CONQUERED; OR, LOVE TRIUMPHANT\n\n\nSweet girl, thy smiles are full of charms,\n\nThy voice is sweeter still,\n\nIt fills the breast with fond alarms,\n\nEchoed by every rill.\n\nI begin this little work with an eulogy upon woman, who has ever been\ndistinguished for her perseverance, her constancy, and her devoted\nattention to those upon whom she has been pleased to place her\n_affections_. Many have been the themes upon which writers and public\nspeakers have dwelt with intense and increasing interest. Among these\ndelightful themes stands that of woman, the balm to all our sighs and\ndisappointments, and the most pre-eminent of all other topics. Here the\npoet and orator have stood and gazed with wonder and with admiration;\nthey have dwelt upon her innocence, the ornament of all her virtues.\nFirst viewing her external charms, such as set forth in her form and\nbenevolent countenance, and then passing to the deep hidden springs of\nloveliness and disinterested devotion. In every clime, and in every age,\nshe has been the pride of her _nation_. Her watchfulness is untiring;\nshe who guarded the sepulcher was the first to approach it, and the last\nto depart from its awful yet sublime scene. Even here, in this highly\nfavored land, we look to her for the security of our institutions, and\nfor our future greatness as a nation. But, strange as it may appear,\nwoman's charms and virtues are but slightly appreciated by thousands.\nThose who should raise the standard of female worth, and paint her value\nwith her virtues, in living colors, upon the banners that are fanned by\nthe zephyrs of heaven, and hand them down to posterity as emblematical\nof a rich inheritance, do not properly estimate them.\n\nMan is not sensible, at all times, of the nature and the emotions which\nbear that name; he does not understand, he will not comprehend; his\nintelligence has not expanded to that degree of glory which drinks in\nthe vast revolution of humanity, its end, its mighty destination, and\nthe causes which operated, and are still operating, to produce a\nmore elevated station, and the objects which energize and enliven its\nconsummation. This he is a stranger to; he is not aware that woman is\nthe recipient of celestial love, and that man is dependent upon her\nto perfect his character; that without her, philosophically and truly\nspeaking, the brightest of his intelligence is but the coldness of a\nwinter moon, whose beams can produce no fruit, whose solar light is not\nits own, but borrowed from the great dispenser of effulgent beauty. We\nhave no disposition in the world to flatter the fair sex, we would raise\nthem above those dastardly principles which only exist in little souls,\ncontracted hearts, and a distracted brain. Often does she unfold herself\nin all her fascinating loveliness, presenting the most captivating\ncharms; yet we find man frequently treats such purity of purpose with\nindifference. Why does he do it? Why does he baffle that which is\ninevitably the source of his better days? Is he so much of a stranger\nto those excellent qualities as not to appreciate woman, as not to have\nrespect to her dignity? Since her art and beauty first captivated man,\nshe has been his delight and his comfort; she has shared alike in his\nmisfortunes and in his prosperity.\n\nWhenever the billows of adversity and the tumultuous waves of trouble\nbeat high, her smiles subdue their fury. Should the tear of sorrow and\nthe mournful sigh of grief interrupt the peace of his mind, her voice\nremoves them all, and she bends from her circle to encourage him onward.\nWhen darkness would obscure his mind, and a thick cloud of gloom would\nbewilder its operations, her intelligent eye darts a ray of streaming\nlight into his heart. Mighty and charming is that disinterested devotion\nwhich she is ever ready to exercise toward man, not waiting till\nthe last moment of his danger, but seeks to relieve him in his early\nafflictions. It gushes forth from the expansive fullness of a tender and\ndevoted heart, where the noblest, the purest, and the most elevated and\nrefined feelings are matured and developed in those many kind offices\nwhich invariably make her character.\n\nIn the room of sorrow and sickness, this unequaled characteristic\nmay always been seen, in the performance of the most charitable acts;\nnothing that she can do to promote the happiness of him who she claims\nto be her protector will be omitted; all is invigorated by the animating\nsunbeams which awaken the heart to songs of gaiety. Leaving this point,\nto notice another prominent consideration, which is generally one of\ngreat moment and of vital importance. Invariably she is firm and steady\nin all her pursuits and aims. There is required a combination of forces\nand extreme opposition to drive her from her position; she takes her\nstand, not to be moved by the sound of Apollo's lyre or the curved bow\nof pleasure.\n\nFirm and true to what she undertakes, and that which she requires by\nher own aggrandizement, and regards as being within the strict rules of\npropriety, she will remain stable and unflinching to the last. A more\ngenuine principle is not to be found in the most determined, resolute\nheart of man. For this she deserves to be held in the highest\ncommendation, for this she deserves the purest of all other blessings,\nand for this she deserves the most laudable reward of all others. It is\na noble characteristic and is worthy of imitation of any age. And when\nwe look at it in one particular aspect, it is still magnified, and grows\nbrighter and brighter the more we reflect upon its eternal duration.\nWhat will she not do, when her word as well as her affections and _love\n_are pledged to her lover? Everything that is dear to her on earth,\nall the hospitalities of kind and loving parents, all the sincerity and\nloveliness of sisters, and the benevolent devotion of brothers, who have\nsurrounded her with every comfort; she will forsake them all, quit the\nharmony and sweet sound of the lute and the harp, and throw herself upon\nthe affections of some devoted admirer, in whom she fondly hopes to\nfind more than she has left behind, which is not often realized by many.\nTruth and virtue all combined! How deserving our admiration and love! Ah\ncruel would it be in man, after she has thus manifested such an unshaken\nconfidence in him, and said by her determination to abandon all the\nendearments and blandishments of home, to act a villainous part, and\nprove a traitor in the revolution of his mission, and then turn Hector\nover the innocent victim whom he swore to protect, in the presence of\nHeaven, recorded by the pen of an angel.\n\nStriking as this trait may unfold itself in her character, and as\npre-eminent as it may stand among the fair display of her other\nqualities, yet there is another, which struggles into existence, and\nadds an additional luster to what she already possesses. I mean that\ndisposition in woman which enables her, in sorrow, in grief, and in\ndistress, to bear all with enduring patience. This she has done, and\ncan and will do, amid the din of war and clash of arms. Scenes and\noccurrences which, to every appearance, are calculated to rend the heart\nwith the profoundest emotions of trouble, do not fetter that exalted\nprinciple imbued in her very nature. It is true, her tender and feeling\nheart may often be moved (as she is thus constituted), but she is not\nconquered, she has not given up to the harlequin of disappointments, her\nenergies have not become clouded in the last movement of misfortune, but\nshe is continually invigorated by the archetype of her affections. She\nmay bury her face in her hands, and let the tear of anguish roll, she\nmay promenade the delightful walks of some garden, decorated with all\nthe flowers of nature, or she may steal out along some gently rippling\nstream, and there, as the silver waters uninterruptedly move forward,\nshed her silent tears; they mingle with the waves, and take a last\nfarewell of their agitated home, to seek a peaceful dwelling among\nthe rolling floods; yet there is a voice rushing from her breast,\nthat proclaims _victory _along the whole line and battlement of her\naffections. That voice is the voice of patience and resignation; that\nvoice is one that bears everything calmly and dispassionately, amid the\nmost distressing scenes; when the fates are arrayed against her peace,\nand apparently plotting for her destruction, still she is resigned.\n\nWoman's affections are deep, consequently her troubles may be made to\nsink deep. Although you may not be able to mark the traces of her grief\nand the furrowings of her anguish upon her winning countenance, yet be\nassured they are nevertheless preying upon her inward person, sapping\nthe very foundation of that heart which alone was made for the weal and\nnot the woe of man. The deep recesses of the soul are fields for their\noperation. But they are not destined simply to take the regions of\nthe heart for their dominion, they are not satisfied merely with\ninterrupting her better feelings; but after a while you may see the\nblooming cheek beginning to droop and fade, her intelligent eye no\nlonger sparkles with the starry light of heaven, her vibrating pulse\nlong since changed its regular motion, and her palpitating bosom beats\nonce more for the midday of her glory. Anxiety and care ultimately throw\nher into the arms of the haggard and grim monster death. But, oh, how\npatient, under every pining influence! Let us view the matter in bolder\ncolors; see her when the dearest object of her affections recklessly\nseeks every bacchanalian pleasure, contents himself with the last\nrubbish of creation. With what solicitude she awaits his return! Sleep\nfails to perform its office--she weeps while the nocturnal shades of the\nnight triumph in the stillness. Bending over some favorite book, whilst\nthe author throws before her mind the most beautiful imagery, she\nstartles at every sound. The midnight silence is broken by the solemn\nannouncement of the return of another morning. He is still absent; she\nlistens for that voice which has so often been greeted by the melodies\nof her own; but, alas! stern silence is all that she receives for her\nvigilance.\n\nMark her unwearied watchfulness, as the night passes away. At last,\nbrutalized by the accursed thing, he staggers along with rage, and,\nshivering with cold, he makes his appearance. Not a murmur is heard from\nher lips. On the contrary, she meets him with a smile--she caresses him\nwith tender arms, with all the gentleness and softness of her sex. Here,\nthen, is seen her disposition, beautifully arrayed. Woman, thou art more\nto be admired than the spicy gales of Arabia, and more sought for than\nthe gold of Golconda. We believe that Woman should associate freely with\nman, and we believe that it is for the preservation of her rights. She\nshould become acquainted with the metaphysical designs of those who\ncondescended to sing the siren song of flattery. This, we think, should\nbe according to the unwritten law of decorum, which is stamped upon\nevery innocent heart. The precepts of prudery are often steeped in the\nguilt of contamination, which blasts the expectations of better moments.\nTruth, and beautiful dreams--loveliness, and delicacy of character, with\ncherished affections of the ideal woman--gentle hopes and aspirations,\nare enough to uphold her in the storms of darkness, without the\ntransferred colorings of a stained sufferer. How often have we seen it\nin our public prints, that woman occupies a false station in the world!\nand some have gone so far as to say it was an unnatural one. So long has\nshe been regarded a weak creature, by the rabble and illiterate--they\nhave looked upon her as an insufficient actress on the great stage of\nhuman life--a mere puppet, to fill up the drama of human existence--a\nthoughtless, inactive being--that she has too often come to the same\nconclusion herself, and has sometimes forgotten her high destination, in\nthe meridian of her glory. We have but little sympathy or patience for\nthose who treat her as a mere Rosy Melindi--who are always fishing for\npretty complements--who are satisfied by the gossamer of Romance,\nand who can be allured by the verbosity of high-flown words, rich in\nlanguage, but poor and barren in sentiment. Beset, as she has been, by\nthe intellectual vulgar, the selfish, the designing, the cunning, the\nhidden, and the artful--no wonder she has sometimes folded her wings\nin despair, and forgotten her _heavenly _mission in the delirium of\nimagination; no wonder she searches out some wild desert, to find a\npeaceful home. But this cannot always continue. A new era is moving\ngently onward, old things are rapidly passing away; old superstitions,\nold prejudices, and old notions are now bidding farewell to their old\nassociates and companions, and giving way to one whose wings are plumed\nwith the light of heaven and tinged by the dews of the morning. There\nis a remnant of blessedness that clings to her in spite of all evil\ninfluence, there is enough of the Divine Master left to accomplish the\nnoblest work ever achieved under the canopy of the vaulted skies; and\nthat time is fast approaching, when the picture of the true woman will\nshine from its frame of glory, to captivate, to win back, to restore,\nand to call into being once more, _the object of her mission_.\n\n\nStar of the brave! thy glory shed, O'er all the earth, thy army led--\nBold meteor of immortal birth! Why come from Heaven to dwell on Earth?\n\nMighty and glorious are the days of youth; happy the moments of the\n_lover_, mingled with smiles and tears of his devoted, and long to be\nremembered are the achievements which he gains with a palpitating heart\nand a trembling hand. A bright and lovely dawn, the harbinger of a fair\nand prosperous day, had arisen over the beautiful little village\nof Cumming, which is surrounded by the most romantic scenery in the\nCherokee country. Brightening clouds seemed to rise from the mist of\nthe fair Chattahoochee, to spread their beauty over the thick forest, to\nguide the hero whose bosom beats with aspirations to conquer the enemy\nthat would tarnish his name, and to win back the admiration of his\nlong-tried friend. He endeavored to make his way through Sawney's\nMountain, where many meet to catch the gales that are continually\nblowing for the refreshment of the stranger and the traveler. Surrounded\nas he was by hills on every side, naked rocks dared the efforts of his\nenergies. Soon the sky became overcast, the sun buried itself in the\nclouds, and the fair day gave place to gloomy twilight, which lay\nheavily on the Indian Plains. He remembered an old Indian Castle, that\nonce stood at the foot of the mountain. He thought if he could make his\nway to this, he would rest contented for a short time. The mountain\nair breathed fragrance--a rosy tinge rested on the glassy waters that\nmurmured at its base. His resolution soon brought him to the remains of\nthe red man's hut: he surveyed with wonder and astonishment the decayed\nbuilding, which time had buried in the dust, and thought to himself,\nhis happiness was not yet complete. Beside the shore of the brook sat\na young man, about eighteen or twenty, who seemed to be reading some\nfavorite book, and who had a remarkably noble countenance--eyes which\nbetrayed more than a common mind. This of course made the youth a\nwelcome guest, and gained him friends in whatever condition of life he\nmight be placed. The traveler observed that he was a well-built figure,\nwhich showed strength and grace in every movement. He accordingly\naddressed him in quite a gentlemanly manner, and inquired of him the way\nto the village. After he had received the desired information, and was\nabout taking his leave, the youth said, “Are you not Major Elfonzo, the\ngreat musician--the champion of a noble cause--the modern Achilles, who\ngained so many victories in the Florida War?” “I bear that name,”\n said the Major, “and those titles, trusting at the same time that the\nministers of grace will carry me triumphantly through all my laudable\nundertakings, and if,” continued the Major, “you, sir, are the\npatronizer of noble deeds, I should like to make you my confidant and\nlearn your address.” The youth looked somewhat amazed, bowed low, mused\nfor a moment, and began: “My name is Roswell. I have been recently\nadmitted to the bar, and can only give a faint outline of my future\nsuccess in that honorable profession; but I trust, sir, like the Eagle,\nI shall look down from lofty rocks upon the dwellings of man, and shall\never be ready to give you any assistance in my official capacity, and\nwhatever this muscular arm of mine can do, whenever it shall be called\nfrom its buried _greatness_.” The Major grasped him by the hand, and\nexclaimed: “O! thou exalted spirit of inspiration--thou flame of burning\nprosperity, may the Heaven-directed blaze be the glare of thy soul, and\nbattle down every rampart that seems to impede your progress!”\n\nThe road which led to the town presented many attractions. Elfonzo had\nbid farewell to the youth of deep feeling, and was now wending his way\nto the dreaming spot of his fondness. The south winds whistled through\nthe woods, as the waters dashed against the banks, as rapid fire in the\npent furnace roars. This brought him to remember while alone, that he\nquietly left behind the hospitality of a father's house, and gladly\nentered the world, with higher hopes than are often realized. But as he\njourneyed onward, he was mindful of the advice of his father, who had\noften looked sadly on the ground when tears of cruelly deceived hope\nmoistened his eye. Elfonzo had been somewhat of a dutiful son; yet fond\nof the amusements of life--had been in distant lands--had enjoyed the\npleasure of the world and had frequently returned to the scenes of\nhis boyhood, almost destitute of many of the comforts of life. In this\ncondition, he would frequently say to his father, “Have I offended you,\nthat you look upon me as a stranger, and frown upon me with stinging\nlooks? Will you not favor me with the sound of your voice? If I have\ntrampled upon your veneration, or have spread a humid veil of darkness\naround your expectations, send me back into the world where no heart\nbeats for me--where the foot of man has never yet trod; but give me at\nleast one kind word--allow me to come into the presence sometimes of\nthy winter-worn locks.” “Forbid it, Heaven, that I should be angry with\nthee,” answered the father, “my son, and yet I send thee back to the\nchildren of the world--to the cold charity of the combat, and to a\nland of victory. I read another destiny in thy countenance--I learn\nthy inclinations from the flame that has already kindled in my soul a\nstrange sensation. It will seek thee, my dear _Elfonzo_, it will find\nthee--thou canst not escape that lighted torch, which shall blot out\nfrom the remembrance of men a long train of prophecies which they have\nforetold against thee. I once thought not so. Once, I was blind; but now\nthe path of life is plain before me, and my sight is clear; yet Elfonzo,\nreturn to thy worldly occupation--take again in thy hand that chord\nof sweet sounds--struggle with the civilized world, and with your own\nheart; fly swiftly to the enchanted ground--let the night-_owl_ send forth\nits screams from the stubborn oak--let the sea sport upon the beach, and\nthe stars sing together; but learn of these, Elfonzo, thy doom, and\nthy hiding-place. Our most innocent as well as our most lawful _desires\n_must often be denied us, that we may learn to sacrifice them to a\nHigher will.”\n\nRemembering such admonitions with gratitude, Elfonzo was immediately\nurged by the recollection of his father's family to keep moving. His\nsteps became quicker and quicker--he hastened through the _piny _woods,\ndark as the forest was, and with joy he very soon reached the little\nvillage of repose, in whose bosom rested the boldest chivalry. His close\nattention to every important object--his modest questions about whatever\nwas new to him--his reverence for wise old age, and his ardent desire to\nlearn many of the fine arts, soon brought him into respectable notice.\n\nOne mild winter day as he walked along the streets toward the Academy,\nwhich stood upon a small eminence, surrounded by native growth--some\nvenerable in its appearance, others young and prosperous--all seemed\ninviting, and seemed to be the very place for learning as well as for\ngenius to spend its research beneath its spreading shades. He entered\nits classic walls in the usual mode of southern manners. The principal\nof the Institution begged him to be seated and listen to the recitations\nthat were going on. He accordingly obeyed the request, and seemed to\nbe much pleased. After the school was dismissed, and the young hearts\nregained their freedom, with the songs of the evening, laughing at the\nanticipated pleasures of a happy home, while others tittered at the\nactions of the past day, he addressed the teacher in a tone that\nindicated a resolution--with an undaunted mind. He said he had\ndetermined to become a student, if he could meet with his approbation.\n“Sir,” said he, “I have spent much time in the world. I have traveled\namong the uncivilized inhabitants of America. I have met with friends,\nand combated with foes; but none of these gratify my ambition, or decide\nwhat is to be my destiny. I see the learned would have an influence\nwith the voice of the people themselves. The despoilers of the remotest\nkingdoms of the earth refer their differences to this class of persons.\nThis the illiterate and inexperienced little dream of; and now if you\nwill receive me as I am, with these deficiencies--with all my misguided\nopinions, I will give you my honor, sir, that I will never disgrace the\nInstitution, or those who have placed you in this honorable station.”\n The instructor, who had met with many disappointments, knew how to\nfeel for a stranger who had been thus turned upon the charities of an\nunfeeling community. He looked at him earnestly, and said: “Be of\ngood cheer--look forward, sir, to the high destination you may attain.\nRemember, the more elevated the mark at which you aim, the more sure,\nthe more glorious, the more magnificent the prize.” From wonder to\nwonder, his encouragement led the impatient listener. A strange nature\nbloomed before him--giant streams promised him success--gardens of\nhidden treasures opened to his view. All this, so vividly described,\nseemed to gain a new witchery from his glowing fancy.\n\nIn 1842 he entered the class, and made rapid progress in the English\nand Latin departments. Indeed, he continued advancing with such rapidity\nthat he was like to become the first in his class, and made such\nunexpected progress, and was so studious, that he had almost forgotten\nthe pictured saint of his affections. The fresh wreaths of the pine and\ncypress had waited anxiously to drop once more the dews of Heavens upon\nthe heads of those who had so often poured forth the tender emotions of\ntheir souls under its boughs. He was aware of the pleasure that he had\nseen there. So one evening, as he was returning from his reading, he\nconcluded he would pay a visit to this enchanting spot. Little did he\nthink of witnessing a shadow of his former happiness, though no doubt\nhe wished it might be so. He continued sauntering by the roadside,\nmeditating on the past. The nearer he approached the spot, the more\nanxious he became. At the moment a tall female figure flitted across his\npath, with a bunch of roses in her hand; her countenance showed uncommon\nvivacity, with a resolute spirit; her ivory teeth already appeared as\nshe smiled beautifully, promenading--while her ringlets of hair dangled\nunconsciously around her snowy neck. Nothing was wanting to complete\nher beauty. The tinge of the rose was in full bloom upon her cheek; the\ncharms of sensibility and tenderness were always her associates.. In\nAmbulinia's bosom dwelt a noble soul--one that never faded--one that\nnever was conquered. Her heart yielded to no feeling but the love of\nElfonzo, on whom she gazed with intense delight, and to whom she felt\nherself more closely bound, because he sought the hand of no other.\nElfonzo was roused from his apparent reverie. His books no longer were\nhis inseparable companions--his thoughts arrayed themselves to encourage\nhim in the field of victory. He endeavored to speak to his supposed\nAmbulinia, but his speech appeared not in words. No, his effort was a\nstream of fire, that kindled his soul into a flame of admiration, and\ncarried his senses away captive. Ambulinia had disappeared, to make him\nmore mindful of his duty. As she walked speedily away through the\npiny woods she calmly echoed: “O! Elfonzo, thou wilt now look from\nthy sunbeams. Thou shalt now walk in a new path--perhaps thy way leads\nthrough darkness; but fear not, the stars foretell happiness.”\n\nNot many days afterward, as surrounded by fragrant flowers she sat one\nevening at twilight, to enjoy the cool breeze that whispered notes of\nmelody along the distant groves, the little birds perched on every\nside, as if to watch the movements of their new visitor. The bells were\ntolling when Elfonzo silently stole along by the wild wood flowers,\nholding in his hand his favorite instrument of music--his eye\ncontinually searching for Ambulinia, who hardly seemed to perceive him,\nas she played carelessly with the songsters that hopped from branch to\nbranch. Nothing could be more striking than the difference between the\ntwo. Nature seemed to have given the more tender soul to Elfonzo, and\nthe stronger and more courageous to Ambulinia. A deep feeling spoke from\nthe eyes of Elfonzo--such a feeling as can only be expressed by those\nwho are blessed as admirers, and by those who are able to return the\nsame with sincerity of heart. He was a few years older than Ambulinia:\nshe had turned a little into her seventeenth. He had almost grown up\nin the Cherokee country, with the same equal proportions as one of the\nnatives. But little intimacy had existed between them until the year\nforty-one--because the youth felt that the character of such a lovely\ngirl was too exalted to inspire any other feeling than that of quiet\nreverence. But as lovers will not always be insulted, at all times and\nunder all circumstances, by the frowns and cold looks of crabbed old\nage, which should continually reflect dignity upon those around, and\ntreat unfortunate as well as the fortunate with a graceful mien, he\ncontinued to use diligence and perseverance. All this lighted a spark\nin his heart that changed his whole character, and like the unyielding\nDeity that follows the storm to check its rage in the forest, he\nresolves for the first time to shake off his embarrassment and return\nwhere he had before only worshiped.\n\nIt could not escape Ambulinia's penetrating eye that he sought an\ninterview with her, which she as anxiously avoided, and assumed a more\ndistant calmness than before, seemingly to destroy all hope. After many\nefforts and struggles with his own person, with timid steps the Major\napproached the damsel, with the same caution as he would have done in\na field of battle. “Lady Ambulinia,” said he, trembling, “I have\nlong desired a moment like this. I dare not let it escape. I fear the\nconsequences; yet I hope your indulgence will at least hear my petition.\nCan you not anticipate what I would say, and what I am about to express?\nWill not you, like Minerva, who sprung from the brain of Jupiter,\nrelease me from thy winding chains or cure me--” “Say no more, Elfonzo,”\n answered Ambulinia, with a serious look, raising her hand as if she\nintended to swear eternal hatred against the whole world; “another\nlady in my place would have perhaps answered your question in bitter\ncoldness. I know not the little arts of my sex. I care but little for\nthe vanity of those who would chide me, and am unwilling as well as\nshamed to be guilty of anything that would lead you to think 'all is not\ngold that glitters'; so be not rash in your resolution. It is better\nto repent now than to do it in a more solemn hour. Yes, I know what you\nwould say. I know you have a costly gift for me--the noblest that man\ncan make--_your heart!_ you should not offer it to one so unworthy.\nHeaven, you know, has allowed my father's house to be made a house of\nsolitude, a home of silent obedience, which my parents say is more to\nbe admired than big names and high-sounding titles. Notwithstanding all\nthis, let me speak the emotions of an honest heart; allow me to say in\nthe fullness of my hopes that I anticipate better days. The bird may\nstretch its wings toward the sun, which it can never reach; and flowers\nof the field appear to ascend in the same direction, because they cannot\ndo otherwise; but man confides his complaints to the saints in whom he\nbelieves; for in their abodes of light they know no more sorrow. From\nyour confession and indicative looks, I must be that person; if so,\ndeceive not yourself.”\n\nElfonzo replied, “Pardon me, my dear madam, for my frankness. I have\nloved you from my earliest days; everything grand and beautiful hath\nborne the image of Ambulinia; while precipices on every hand surrounded\nme, your _guardian angel_ stood and beckoned me away from the deep\nabyss. In every trial, in every misfortune, I have met with your helping\nhand; yet I never dreamed or dared to cherish thy love till a voice\nimpaired with age encouraged the cause, and declared they who acquired\nthy favor should win a victory. I saw how Leos worshipped thee. I felt\nmy own unworthiness. I began to _know jealousy_--a strong guest, indeed,\nin my bosom--yet I could see if I gained your admiration Leos was to be\nmy rival. I was aware that he had the influence of your parents, and the\nwealth of a deceased relative, which is too often mistaken for permanent\nand regular tranquillity; yet I have determined by your permission\nto beg an interest in your prayers--to ask you to animate my drooping\nspirits by your smiles and your winning looks; for if you but speak I\nshall be conqueror, my enemies shall stagger like Olympus shakes. And\nthough earth and sea may tremble, and the charioteer of the sun may\nforget his dashing steed, yet I am assured that it is only to arm me\nwith divine weapons which will enable me to complete my long-tried\nintention.”\n\n“Return to your self, Elfonzo,” said Ambulinia, pleasantly; “a dream\nof vision has disturbed your intellect; you are above the atmosphere,\ndwelling in the celestial regions; nothing is there that urges or\nhinders, nothing that brings discord into our present litigation. I\nentreat you to condescend a little, and be a man, and forget it all.\nWhen Homer describes the battle of the gods and noble men fighting with\ngiants and dragons, they represent under this image our struggles with\nthe delusions of our passions. You have exalted me, an unhappy girl, to\nthe skies; you have called me a saint, and portrayed in your imagination\nan angel in human form. Let her remain such to you, let her continue to\nbe as you have supposed, and be assured that she will consider a share\nin your esteem as her highest treasure. Think not that I would allure\nyou from the path in which your conscience leads you; for you know I\nrespect the conscience of others, as I would die for my own. Elfonzo, if\nI am worthy of thy love, let such conversation never again pass between\nus. Go, seek a nobler theme! we will seek it in the stream of time as\nthe sun set in the Tigris.” As she spake these words she grasped the\nhand of Elfonzo, saying at the same time, “Peace and prosperity\nattend you, my hero: be up and doing!” Closing her remarks with this\nexpression, she walked slowly away, leaving Elfonzo astonished and\namazed. He ventured not to follow or detain her. Here he stood alone,\ngazing at the stars; confounded as he was, here he stood. The rippling\nstream rolled on at his feet. Twilight had already begun to draw her\nsable mantle over the earth, and now and then the fiery smoke would\nascend from the little town which lay spread out before him. The\ncitizens seemed to be full of life and good-humor; but poor Elfonzo saw\nnot a brilliant scene. No; his future life stood before him, stripped of\nthe hopes that once adorned all his sanguine desires. “Alas!” said he,\n“am I now Grief's disappointed son at last.” Ambulinia's image rose\nbefore his fancy. A mixture of ambition and greatness of soul moved upon\nhis young heart, and encouraged him to bear all his crosses with the\npatience of a Job, notwithstanding he had to encounter with so many\nobstacles. He still endeavored to prosecute his studies, and reasonably\nprogressed in his education. Still, he was not content; there was\nsomething yet to be done before his happiness was complete. He would\nvisit his friends and acquaintances. They would invite him to social\nparties, insisting that he should partake of the amusements that were\ngoing on. This he enjoyed tolerably well. The ladies and gentlemen were\ngenerally well pleased with the Major; as he delighted all with his\nviolin, which seemed to have a thousand chords--more symphonious than\nthe Muses of Apollo and more enchanting than the ghost of the Hills.\nHe passed some days in the country. During that time Leos had made many\ncalls upon Ambulinia, who was generally received with a great deal of\ncourtesy by the family. They thought him to be a young man worthy of\nattention, though he had but little in his soul to attract the attention\nor even win the affections of her whose graceful manners had almost made\nhim a slave to every bewitching look that fell from her eyes. Leos made\nseveral attempts to tell her of his fair prospects--how much he loved\nher, and how much it would add to his bliss if he could but think she\nwould be willing to share these blessings with him; but, choked by his\nundertaking, he made himself more like an inactive drone than he did\nlike one who bowed at beauty's shrine.\n\nElfonzo again wends his way to the stately walls and new-built village.\nHe now determines to see the end of the prophesy which had been foretold\nto him. The clouds burst from his sight; he believes if he can but see\nhis Ambulinia, he can open to her view the bloody altars that have\nbeen misrepresented to stigmatize his name. He knows that her breast is\ntransfixed with the sword of reason, and ready at all times to detect\nthe hidden villainy of her enemies. He resolves to see her in her own\nhome, with the consoling theme: “'I can but perish if I go.' Let\nthe consequences be what they may,” said he, “if I die, it shall be\ncontending and struggling for my own rights.”\n\nNight had almost overtaken him when he arrived in town. Colonel Elder, a\nnoble-hearted, high-minded, and independent man, met him at his door as\nusual, and seized him by the hand. “Well, Elfonzo,” said the Colonel,\n“how does the world use you in your efforts?” “I have no objection to\nthe world,” said Elfonzo, “but the people are rather singular in some of\ntheir opinions.” “Aye, well,” said the Colonel, “you must remember that\ncreation is made up of many mysteries; just take things by the right\nhandle; be always sure you know which is the smooth side before you\nattempt your polish; be reconciled to your fate, be it what it may;\nand never find fault with your condition, unless your complaining will\nbenefit it. Perseverance is a principle that should be commendable\nin those who have judgment to govern it. I should never have been so\nsuccessful in my hunting excursions had I waited till the deer, by some\nmagic dream, had been drawn to the muzzle of the gun before I made an\nattempt to fire at the game that dared my boldness in the wild forest.\nThe great mystery in hunting seems to be--a good marksman, a resolute\nmind, a fixed determination, and my word for it, you will never return\nhome without sounding your horn with the breath of a new victory. And\nso with every other undertaking. Be confident that your ammunition is of\nthe right kind--always pull your trigger with a steady hand, and so soon\nas you perceive a calm, touch her off, and the spoils are yours.”\n\nThis filled him with redoubled vigor, and he set out with a stronger\nanxiety than ever to the home of Ambulinia. A few short steps soon\nbrought him to the door, half out of breath. He rapped gently.\nAmbulinia, who sat in the parlor alone, suspecting Elfonzo was near,\nventured to the door, opened it, and beheld the hero, who stood in an\nhumble attitude, bowed gracefully, and as they caught each other's looks\nthe light of peace beamed from the eyes of Ambulinia. Elfonzo caught the\nexpression; a halloo of smothered shouts ran through every vein, and for\nthe first time he dared to impress a kiss upon her cheek. The scene was\noverwhelming; had the temptation been less animating, he would not have\nventured to have acted so contrary to the desired wish of his Ambulinia;\nbut who could have withstood the irrestistable temptation! What society\ncondemns the practice but a cold, heartless, uncivilized people that\nknow nothing of the warm attachments of refined society? Here the dead\nwas raised to his long-cherished hopes, and the lost was found. Here\nall doubt and danger were buried in the vortex of oblivion; sectional\ndifferences no longer disunited their opinions; like the freed bird from\nthe cage, sportive claps its rustling wings, wheels about to heaven in a\njoyful strain, and raises its notes to the upper sky. Ambulinia insisted\nupon Elfonzo to be seated, and give her a history of his unnecessary\nabsence; assuring him the family had retired, consequently they would\never remain ignorant of his visit. Advancing toward him, she gave a\nbright display of her rosy neck, and from her head the ambrosial locks\nbreathed divine fragrance; her robe hung waving to his view, while she\nstood like a goddess confessed before him.\n\n“It does seem to me, my dear sir,” said Ambulinia, “that you have been\ngone an age. Oh, the restless hours I have spent since I last saw you,\nin yon beautiful grove. There is where I trifled with your feelings for\nthe express purpose of trying your attachment for me. I now find you are\ndevoted; but ah! I trust you live not unguarded by the powers of Heaven.\nThough oft did I refuse to join my hand with thine, and as oft did\nI cruelly mock thy entreaties with borrowed shapes: yes, I feared to\nanswer thee by terms, in words sincere and undissembled. O! could I\npursue, and you have leisure to hear the annals of my woes, the evening\nstar would shut Heaven's gates upon the impending day before my\ntale would be finished, and this night would find me soliciting your\nforgiveness.”\n\n“Dismiss thy fears and thy doubts,” replied Elfonzo.\n\n“Look, O! look: that angelic look of thine--bathe not thy visage in\ntears; banish those floods that are gathering; let my confession and my\npresence bring thee some relief.” “Then, indeed, I will be cheerful,”\n said Ambulinia, “and I think if we will go to the exhibition this\nevening, we certainly will see something worthy of our attention. One\nof the most tragical scenes is to be acted that has ever been witnessed,\nand one that every jealous-hearted person should learn a lesson from. It\ncannot fail to have a good effect, as it will be performed by those who\nare young and vigorous, and learned as well as enticing. You are aware,\nMajor Elfonzo, who are to appear on the stage, and what the characters\nare to represent.” “I am acquainted with the circumstances,” replied\nElfonzo, “and as I am to be one of the musicians upon that interesting\noccasion, I should be much gratified if you would favor me with your\ncompany during the hours of the exercises.”\n\n“What strange notions are in your mind?” inquired Ambulinia. “Now I know\nyou have something in view, and I desire you to tell me why it is that\nyou are so anxious that I should continue with you while the exercises\nare going on; though if you think I can add to your happiness and\npredilections, I have no particular objection to acquiesce in your\nrequest. Oh, I think I foresee, now, what you anticipate.” “And will\nyou have the goodness to tell me what you think it will be?” inquired\nElfonzo. “By all means,” answered Ambulinia; “a rival, sir, you would\nfancy in your own mind; but let me say for you, fear not! fear not! I\nwill be one of the last persons to disgrace my sex by thus encouraging\nevery one who may feel disposed to visit me, who may honor me with their\ngraceful bows and their choicest compliments. It is true that young men\ntoo often mistake civil politeness for the finer emotions of the heart,\nwhich is tantamount to courtship; but, ah! how often are they deceived,\nwhen they come to test the weight of sunbeams with those on whose\nstrength hangs the future happiness of an untried life.”\n\nThe people were now rushing to the Academy with impatient anxiety; the\nband of music was closely followed by the students; then the parents\nand guardians; nothing interrupted the glow of spirits which ran through\nevery bosom, tinged with the songs of a Virgil and the tide of a Homer.\nElfonzo and Ambulinia soon repaired to the scene, and fortunately for\nthem both the house was so crowded that they took their seats together\nin the music department, which was not in view of the auditory. This\nfortuitous circumstances added more the bliss of the Major than a\nthousand such exhibitions would have done. He forgot that he was man;\nmusic had lost its charms for him; whenever he attempted to carry his\npart, the string of the instrument would break, the bow became stubborn,\nand refused to obey the loud calls of the audience. Here, he said, was\nthe paradise of his home, the long-sought-for opportunity; he felt as\nthough he could send a million supplications to the throne of Heaven for\nsuch an exalted privilege. Poor Leos, who was somewhere in the crowd,\nlooking as attentively as if he was searching for a needle in a\nhaystack; here he stood, wondering to himself why Ambulinia was not\nthere. “Where can she be? Oh! if she was only here, how I could relish\nthe scene! Elfonzo is certainly not in town; but what if he is? I have\ngot the wealth, if I have not the dignity, and I am sure that the squire\nand his lady have always been particular friends of mine, and I think\nwith this assurance I shall be able to get upon the blind side of the\nrest of the family and make the heaven-born Ambulinia the mistress of\nall I possess.” Then, again, he would drop his head, as if attempting\nto solve the most difficult problem in Euclid. While he was thus\nconjecturing in his own mind, a very interesting part of the exhibition\nwas going on, which called the attention of all present. The curtains\nof the stage waved continually by the repelled forces that were given\nto them, which caused Leos to behold Ambulinia leaning upon the chair\nof Elfonzo. Her lofty beauty, seen by the glimmering of the chandelier,\nfilled his heart with rapture, he knew not how to contain himself; to go\nwhere they were would expose him to ridicule; to continue where he was,\nwith such an object before him, without being allowed an explanation in\nthat trying hour, would be to the great injury of his mental as well as\nof his physical powers; and, in the name of high heaven, what must he\ndo? Finally, he resolved to contain himself as well as he conveniently\ncould, until the scene was over, and then he would plant himself at the\ndoor, to arrest Ambulinia from the hands of the insolent Elfonzo, and\nthus make for himself a more prosperous field of immortality than ever\nwas decreed by Omnipotence, or ever pencil drew or artist imagined.\nAccordingly he made himself sentinel, immediately after the performance\nof the evening--retained his position apparently in defiance of all the\nworld; he waited, he gazed at every lady, his whole frame trembled; here\nhe stood, until everything like human shape had disappeared from the\ninstitution, and he had done nothing; he had failed to accomplish that\nwhich he so eagerly sought for. Poor, unfortunate creature! he had\nnot the eyes of an Argus, or he might have seen his Juno and Elfonzo,\nassisted by his friend Sigma, make their escape from the window, and,\nwith the rapidity of a race-horse, hurry through the blast of the storm\nto the residence of her father, without being recognized. He did not\ntarry long, but assured Ambulinia the endless chain of their existence\nwas more closely connected than ever, since he had seen the virtuous,\ninnocent, imploring, and the constant Amelia murdered by the\njealous-hearted Farcillo, the accursed of the land.\n\nThe following is the tragical scene, which is only introduced to show\nthe subject-matter that enabled Elfonzo to come to such a determinate\nresolution that nothing of the kind should ever dispossess him of his\ntrue character, should he be so fortunate as to succeed in his present\nundertaking.\n\nAmelia was the wife of Farcillo, and a virtuous woman; Gracia, a young\nlady, was her particular friend and confidant. Farcillo grew jealous\nof Amelia, murders her, finds out that he was deceived, _and stabs\nhimself_. Amelia appears alone, talking to herself.\n\nA. Hail, ye solitary ruins of antiquity, ye sacred tombs and silent\nwalks! it is your aid I invoke; it is to you, my soul, wrapt in deep\nmediation, pours forth its prayer. Here I wander upon the stage of\nmortality, since the world hath turned against me. Those whom I believed\nto be my friends, alas! are now my enemies, planting thorns in all my\npaths, poisoning all my pleasures, and turning the past to pain. What a\nlingering catalogue of sighs and tears lies just before me, crowding\nmy aching bosom with the fleeting dream of humanity, which must shortly\nterminate. And to what purpose will all this bustle of life, these\nagitations and emotions of the heart have conduced, if it leave behind\nit nothing of utility, if it leave no traces of improvement? Can it be\nthat I am deceived in my conclusions? No, I see that I have nothing to\nhope for, but everything to fear, which tends to drive me from the walks\nof time.\n\n\nOh! in this dead night, if loud winds arise,\n\nTo lash the surge and bluster in the skies,\n\nMay the west its furious rage display,\n\nToss me with storms in the watery way.\n\n(Enter Gracia.)\n\nG. Oh, Amelia, is it you, the object of grief, the daughter of opulence,\nof wisdom and philosophy, that thus complaineth? It cannot be you are\nthe child of misfortune, speaking of the monuments of former ages, which\nwere allotted not for the reflection of the distressed, but for the\nfearless and bold.\n\nA. Not the child of poverty, Gracia, or the heir of glory and peace, but\nof fate. Remember, I have wealth more than wit can number; I have had\npower more than kings could emcompass; yet the world seems a desert; all\nnature appears an afflictive spectacle of warring passions. This blind\nfatality, that capriciously sports with the rules and lives of mortals,\ntells me that the mountains will never again send forth the water of\ntheir springs to my thirst. Oh, that I might be freed and set at liberty\nfrom wretchedness! But I fear, I fear this will never be.\n\nG. Why, Amelia, this untimely grief? What has caused the sorrows that\nbespeak better and happier days, to those lavish out such heaps of\nmisery? You are aware that your instructive lessons embellish the mind\nwith holy truths, by wedding its attention to none but great and noble\naffections.\n\nA. This, of course, is some consolation. I will ever love my own species\nwith feelings of a fond recollection, and while I am studying to advance\nthe universal philanthropy, and the spotless name of my own sex, I will\ntry to build my own upon the pleasing belief that I have accelerated the\nadvancement of one who whispers of departed confidence.\n\n\nAnd I, like some poor peasant fated to reside\n\nRemote from friends, in a forest wide.\n\nOh, see what woman's woes and human wants require,\n\nSince that great day hath spread the seed of sinful fire.\n\nG. Look up, thou poor disconsolate; you speak of quitting earthly\nenjoyments. Unfold thy bosom to a friend, who would be willing to\nsacrifice every enjoyment for the restoration of the dignity and\ngentleness of mind which used to grace your walks, and which is so\nnatural to yourself; not only that, but your paths were strewed with\nflowers of every hue and of every order.\n\n\nWith verdant green the mountains glow,\n\nFor thee, for thee, the lilies grow;\n\nFar stretched beneath the tented hills,\n\nA fairer flower the valley fills.\n\nA. Oh, would to Heaven I could give you a short narrative of my\nformer prospects for happiness, since you have acknowledged to be an\nunchangeable confidant--the richest of all other blessings. Oh, ye names\nforever glorious, ye celebrated scenes, ye renowned spot of my hymeneal\nmoments; how replete is your chart with sublime reflections! How many\nprofound vows, decorated with immaculate deeds, are written upon the\nsurface of that precious spot of earth where I yielded up my life of\ncelibacy, bade youth with all its beauties a final adieu, took a last\nfarewell of the laurels that had accompanied me up the hill of my\njuvenile career. It was then I began to descend toward the valley of\ndisappointment and sorrow; it was then I cast my little bark upon a\nmysterious ocean of wedlock, with him who then smiled and caressed me,\nbut, alas! now frowns with bitterness, and has grown jealous and cold\ntoward me, because the ring he gave me is misplaced or lost. Oh, bear\nme, ye flowers of memory, softly through the eventful history of past\ntimes; and ye places that have witnessed the progression of man in\nthe circle of so many societies, and, of, aid my recollection, while I\nendeavor to trace the vicissitudes of a life devoted in endeavoring to\ncomfort him that I claim as the object of my wishes.\n\n\nAh! ye mysterious men, of all the world, how few\n\nAct just to Heaven and to your promise true!\n\nBut He who guides the stars with a watchful eye,\n\nThe deeds of men lay open without disguise;\n\nOh, this alone will avenge the wrongs I bear,\n\nFor all the oppressed are His peculiar care.\n\n(F. makes a slight noise.)\n\nA. Who is there--Farcillo?\n\nG. Then I must gone. Heaven protect you. Oh, Amelia, farewell, be of\ngood cheer.\n\n\nMay you stand like Olympus' towers,\n\nAgainst earth and all jealous powers!\n\nMay you, with loud shouts ascend on high\n\nSwift as an eagle in the upper sky.\n\nA. Why so cold and distant tonight, Farcillo? Come, let us each other\ngreet, and forget all the past, and give security for the future.\n\nF. Security! talk to me about giving security for the future--what an\ninsulting requisition! Have you said your prayers tonight, Madam Amelia?\n\nA. Farcillo, we sometimes forget our duty, particularly when we expect\nto be caressed by others.\n\nF. If you bethink yourself of any crime, or of any fault, that is yet\nconcealed from the courts of Heaven and the thrones of grace, I bid you\nask and solicit forgiveness for it now.\n\nA. Oh, be kind, Farcillo, don't treat me so. What do you mean by all\nthis?\n\nF. Be kind, you say; you, madam, have forgot that kindness you owe to\nme, and bestowed it upon another; you shall suffer for your conduct\nwhen you make your peace with your God. I would not slay thy unprotected\nspirit. I call to Heaven to be my guard and my watch--I would not kill\nthy soul, in which all once seemed just, right, and perfect; but I must\nbe brief, woman.\n\nA. What, talk you of killing? Oh, Farcillo, Farcillo, what is the\nmatter?\n\nF. Aye, I do, without doubt; mark what I say, Amelia.\n\nA. Then, O God, O Heaven, and Angels, be propitious, and have mercy upon\nme.\n\nF. Amen to that, madam, with all my heart, and with all my soul.\n\nA. Farcillo, listen to me one moment; I hope you will not kill me.\n\nF. Kill you, aye, that I will; attest it, ye fair host of light, record\nit, ye dark imps of hell!\n\nA. Oh, I fear you--you are fatal when darkness covers your brow; yet I\nknow not why I should fear, since I never wronged you in all my life. I\nstand, sir, guiltless before you.\n\nF. You pretend to say you are guiltless! Think of thy sins, Amelia;\nthink, oh, think, hidden woman.\n\nA. Wherein have I not been true to you? That death is unkind, cruel, and\nunnatural, that kills for living.\n\nF. Peace, and be still while I unfold to thee.\n\nA. I will, Farcillo, and while I am thus silent, tell me the cause of\nsuch cruel coldness in an hour like this.\n\nF. That _ring_, oh, that ring I so loved, and gave thee as the ring of\nmy heart; the allegiance you took to be faithful, when it was presented;\nthe kisses and smiles with which you honored it. You became tired of\nthe donor, despised it as a plague, and finally gave it to Malos, the\nhidden, the vile traitor.\n\nA. No, upon my word and honor, I never did; I appeal to the Most High to\nbear me out in this matter. Send for Malos, and ask him.\n\nF. Send for Malos, aye! Malos you wish to see; I thought so. I knew you\ncould not keep his name concealed. Amelia, sweet Amelia, take heed,\ntake heed of perjury; you are on the stage of death, to suffer for _your\nsins_.\n\nA. What, not to die I hope, my Farcillo, my ever beloved.\n\nF. Yes, madam, to die a traitor's death. Shortly your spirit shall take\nits exit; therefore confess freely thy sins, for to deny tends only to\nmake me groan under the bitter cup thou hast made for me. Thou art to\ndie with the name of traitor on thy brow!\n\nA. Then, O Lord, have mercy upon me; give me courage, give me grace and\nfortitude to stand this hour of trial.\n\nF. Amen, I say, with all my heart.\n\nA. And, oh, Farcillo, will you have mercy, too? I never intentionally\noffended you in all my life, never _loved _Malos, never gave him cause\nto think so, as the high court of Justice will acquit me before its\ntribunal.\n\nF. Oh, false, perjured woman, thou didst chill my blood, and makest me a\ndemon like thyself. I saw the ring.\n\nA. He found it, then, or got it clandestinely; send for him, and let him\nconfess the truth; let his confession be sifted.\n\nF. And you still wish to see him! I tell you, madam, he hath already\nconfessed, and thou knowest the darkness of thy heart.\n\nA. What, my deceived Farcillo, that I gave him the ring, in which all my\naffections were concentrated? Oh, surely not.\n\nF. Aye, he did. Ask thy conscience, and it will speak with a voice of\nthunder to thy soul.\n\nA. He will not say so, he dare not, he cannot.\n\nF. No, he will not say so now, because his mouth, I trust, is hushed in\ndeath, and his body stretched to the four winds of heaven, to be torn to\npieces by carnivorous birds.\n\nA. What, he is dead, and gone to the world of spirits with that\ndeclaration in his mouth? Oh, unhappy man! Oh, insupportable hour!\n\nF. Yes, and had all his sighs and looks and tears been lives, my great\nrevenge could have slain them all, without the least condemnation.\n\nA. Alas! he is ushered into eternity without testing the matter for\nwhich I am abused and sentenced and condemned to die.\n\nF. Cursed, infernal woman! Weepest thou for him to my face? He that hath\nrobbed me of my peace, my energy, the whole love of my life? Could I\ncall the fabled Hydra, I would have him live and perish, survive and\ndie, until the sun itself would grow dim with age. I would make him\nhave the thirst of a Tantalus, and roll the wheel of an Ixion, until the\nstars of heaven should quit their brilliant stations.\n\nA. Oh, invincible God, save me! Oh, unsupportable moment! Oh, heavy\nhour! Banish me, Farcillo--send me where no eye can ever see me, where\nno sound shall ever great my ear; but, oh, slay me not, Farcillo; vent\nthy rage and thy spite upon this emaciated frame of mine, only spare my\nlife.\n\nF. Your petitions avail nothing, cruel Amelia.\n\nA. Oh, Farcillo, perpetrate the dark deed tomorrow; let me live till\nthen, for my past kindness to you, and it may be some kind angel will\nshow to you that I am not only the object of innocence, but one who\nnever loved another but your noble self.\n\nF. Amelia, the decree has gone forth, it is to be done, and that\nquickly; thou art to die, madam.\n\nA. But half an hour allow me, to see my father and my only child, to\ntell her the treachery and vanity of this world.\n\nF. There is no alternative, there is no pause: my daughter shall not see\nits deceptive mother die; your father shall not know that his daughter\nfell disgraced, despised by all but her enchanting Malos.\n\nA. Oh, Farcillo, put up thy threatening dagger into its scabbard; let\nit rest and be still, just while I say one prayer for thee and for my\nchild.\n\nF. It is too late, thy doom is fixed, thou hast not confessed to Heaven\nor to me, my child's protector--thou art to die. Ye powers of earth and\nheaven, protect and defend me in this alone. (_Stabs her while imploring\nfor mercy._)\n\nA. Oh, Farcillo, Farcillo, a guiltless death I die.\n\nF. Die! die! die!\n\n(Gracia enters running, falls on her knees weeping, and kisses Amelia.)\n\nG. Oh, Farcillo, Farcillo! oh, Farcillo!\n\nF. I am here, the genius of the age, and the avenger of my wrongs.\n\nG. Oh, lady, speak once more; sweet Amelia, oh, speak again. Gone,\ngone--yes, forever gone! Farcillo, oh, cold-hearted Farcillo, some evil\nfiend hath urged you to do this, Farcillo.\n\nF. Say not so again, or you shall receive the same fate. I did the\nglorious deed, madam--beware, then, how you talk.\n\nG. I fear not your implements of war; I will let you know you have not\nthe power to do me harm. If you have a heart of triple brass, it shall\nbe reached and melted, and thy blood shall chill thy veins and grow\nstiff in thy arteries. Here is the ring of the virtuous and innocent\nmurdered Amelia; I obtained it from Malos, who yet lives, in hopes\nthat he will survive the wound given him, and says he got it\nclandestinely--declares Amelia to be the princess of truth and virtue,\ninvulnerable to anything like forgetting her first devotion to thee.\nThe world has heard of your conduct and your jealousy, and with one\nuniversal voice declares her to be the best of all in piety; that she is\nthe star of this great universe, and a more virtuous woman never lived\nsince the wheels of time began. Oh, had you waited till tomorrow, or\nuntil I had returned, some kind window would have been opened to her\nrelief. But, alas! she is gone--yes, forever gone, to try the realities\nof an unknown world!\n\n(Farcillo leaning over the body of Amelia.)\n\nF. Malos not dead, and here is my ring! Oh, Amelia! falsely murdered!\nOh, bloody deed! Oh, wretch that I am! Oh, angels forgive me! Oh, God,\nwithhold thy vengeance! Oh, Amelia! if Heaven would make a thousand\nworlds like this, set with diamonds, and all of one perfect chrysolite,\nI would not have done this for them all, I would not have frowned and\ncursed as I did. Oh, she was heavenly true, nursed in the very lap\nof bright angels! Cursed slave that I am! Jealousy, oh! thou infernal\ndemon! Lost, lost to every sense of honor! Oh! Amelia--heaven-born\nAmelia--dead, dead! Oh! oh! oh!--then let me die with thee. Farewell!\nfarewell! ye world that deceived me! (_Stabs himself_.)\n\nSoon after the excitement of this tragical scene was over, and the\nenlisted feeling for Amelia had grown more buoyant with Elfonzo and\nAmbulinia, he determined to visit his retired home, and make the\nnecessary improvements to enjoy a better day; consequently he conveyed\nthe following lines to Ambulinia:\n\n\nGo tell the world that hope is glowing,\n\nGo bid the rocks their silence break,\n\nGo tell the stars that love is glowing,\n\nThen bid the hero his lover take.\n\nIn the region where scarcely the foot of man hath ever trod, where the\nwoodman hath not found his way, lies a blooming grove, seen only by the\nsun when he mounts his lofty throne, visited only by the light of the\nstars, to whom are entrusted the guardianship of earth, before the\nsun sinks to rest in his rosy bed. High cliffs of rocks surround the\nromantic place, and in the small cavity of the rocky wall grows the\ndaffodil clear and pure; and as the wind blows along the enchanting\nlittle mountain which surrounds the lonely spot, it nourishes the\nflowers with the dew-drops of heaven. Here is the seat of Elfonzo;\ndarkness claims but little victory over this dominion, and in vain does\nshe spread out her gloomy wings. Here the waters flow perpetually, and\nthe trees lash their tops together to bid the welcome visitor a happy\nmuse. Elfonzo, during his short stay in the country, had fully persuaded\nhimself that it was his duty to bring this solemn matter to an issue.\nA duty that he individually owed, as a gentleman, to the parents of\nAmbulinia, a duty in itself involving not only his own happiness and\nhis own standing in society, but one that called aloud the act of the\nparties to make it perfect and complete. How he should communicate his\nintentions to get a favorable reply, he was at a loss to know; he knew\nnot whether to address Esq. Valeer in prose or in poetry, in a jocular\nor an argumentative manner, or whether he should use moral suasion,\nlegal injunction, or seizure and take by reprisal; if it was to do the\nlatter, he would have no difficulty in deciding in his own mind, but his\ngentlemanly honor was at stake; so he concluded to address the following\nletter to the father and mother of Ambulinia, as his address in person\nhe knew would only aggravate the old gentleman, and perhaps his lady.\n\nCumming, Ga., January 22, 1844\n\nMr. and Mrs. Valeer--\n\nAgain I resume the pleasing task of addressing you, and once more beg\nan immediate answer to my many salutations. From every circumstance that\nhas taken place, I feel in duty bound to comply with my obligations; to\nforfeit my word would be more than I dare do; to break my pledge, and my\nvows that have been witnessed, sealed, and delivered in the presence of\nan unseen Deity, would be disgraceful on my part, as well as ruinous to\nAmbulinia. I wish no longer to be kept in suspense about this matter. I\nwish to act gentlemanly in every particular. It is true, the promises I\nhave made are unknown to any but Ambulinia, and I think it unnecessary\nto here enumerate them, as they who promise the most generally perform\nthe least. Can you for a moment doubt my sincerity or my character? My\nonly wish is, sir, that you may calmly and dispassionately look at\nthe situation of the case, and if your better judgment should dictate\notherwise, my obligations may induce me to pluck the flower that you\nso diametrically opposed. We have sworn by the saints--by the gods\nof battle, and by that faith whereby just men are made perfect--to be\nunited. I hope, my dear sir, you will find it convenient as well as\nagreeable to give me a favorable answer, with the signature of Mrs.\nValeer, as well as yourself.\n\nWith very great esteem,\n\nyour humble servant,\n\nJ. I. Elfonzo.\n\nThe moon and stars had grown pale when Ambulinia had retired to rest. A\ncrowd of unpleasant thoughts passed through her bosom. Solitude dwelt\nin her chamber--no sound from the neighboring world penetrated its\nstillness; it appeared a temple of silence, of repose, and of mystery.\nAt that moment she heard a still voice calling her father. In an\ninstant, like the flash of lightning, a thought ran through her mind\nthat it must be the bearer of Elfonzo's communication. “It is not a\ndream!” she said, “no, I cannot read dreams. Oh! I would to Heaven I was\nnear that glowing eloquence--that poetical language--it charms the\nmind in an inexpressible manner, and warms the coldest heart.” While\nconsoling herself with this strain, her father rushed into her room\nalmost frantic with rage, exclaiming: “Oh, Ambulinia! Ambulinia!!\nundutiful, ungrateful daughter! What does this mean? Why does this\nletter bear such heart-rending intelligence? Will you quit a father's\nhouse with this debased wretch, without a place to lay his distracted\nhead; going up and down the country, with every novel object that may\nchance to wander through this region. He is a pretty man to make love\nknown to his superiors, and you, Ambulinia, have done but little credit\nto yourself by honoring his visits. Oh, wretchedness! can it be that\nmy hopes of happiness are forever blasted! Will you not listen to a\nfather's entreaties, and pay some regard to a mother's tears. I know,\nand I do pray that God will give me fortitude to bear with this sea\nof troubles, and rescue my daughter, my Ambulinia, as a brand from the\neternal burning.” “Forgive me, father, oh! forgive thy child,” replied\nAmbulinia. “My heart is ready to break, when I see you in this grieved\nstate of agitation. Oh! think not so meanly of me, as that I mourn for\nmy own danger. Father, I am only woman. Mother, I am only the templement\nof thy youthful years, but will suffer courageously whatever punishment\nyou think proper to inflict upon me, if you will but allow me to comply\nwith my most sacred promises--if you will but give me my personal right\nand my personal liberty. Oh, father! if your generosity will but give me\nthese, I ask nothing more. When Elfonzo offered me his heart, I gave\nhim my hand, never to forsake him, and now may the mighty God banish me\nbefore I leave him in adversity. What a heart must I have to rejoice in\nprosperity with him whose offers I have accepted, and then, when poverty\ncomes, haggard as it may be, for me to trifle with the oracles of\nHeaven, and change with every fluctuation that may interrupt our\nhappiness--like the politician who runs the political gantlet for office\none day, and the next day, because the horizon is darkened a little,\nhe is seen running for his life, for fear he might perish in its ruins.\nWhere is the philosophy, where is the consistency, where is the charity,\nin conduct like this? Be happy then, my beloved father, and forget me;\nlet the sorrow of parting break down the wall of separation and make\nus equal in our feeling; let me now say how ardently I love you; let\nme kiss that age-worn cheek, and should my tears bedew thy face, I will\nwipe them away. Oh, I never can forget you; no, never, never!”\n\n“Weep not,” said the father, “Ambulinia. I will forbid Elfonzo my house,\nand desire that you may keep retired a few days. I will let him know\nthat my friendship for my family is not linked together by cankered\nchains; and if he ever enters upon my premises again, I will send him\nto his long home.” “Oh, father! let me entreat you to be calm upon this\noccasion, and though Elfonzo may be the sport of the clouds and winds,\nyet I feel assured that no fate will send him to the silent tomb until\nthe God of the Universe calls him hence with a triumphant voice.”\n\nHere the father turned away, exclaiming: “I will answer his letter in a\nvery few words, and you, madam, will have the goodness to stay at home\nwith your mother; and remember, I am determined to protect you from the\nconsuming fire that looks so fair to your view.”\n\nCumming, January 22, 1844.\n\nSir--In regard to your request, I am as I ever have been, utterly\nopposed to your marrying into my family; and if you have any regard for\nyourself, or any gentlemanly feeling, I hope you will mention it to me\nno more; but seek some other one who is not so far superior to you in\nstanding.\n\nW. W. Valeer.\n\nWhen Elfonzo read the above letter, he became so much depressed in\nspirits that many of his friends thought it advisable to use other means\nto bring about the happy union. “Strange,” said he, “that the contents\nof this diminutive letter should cause me to have such depressed\nfeelings; but there is a nobler theme than this. I know not why my\n_military title_ is not as great as that of _Squire Valeer_. For my life\nI cannot see that my ancestors are inferior to those who are so bitterly\nopposed to my marriage with Ambulinia. I know I have seen huge mountains\nbefore me, yet, when I think that I know gentlemen will insult me upon\nthis delicate matter, should I become angry at fools and babblers, who\npride themselves in their impudence and ignorance? No. My equals! I\nknow not where to find them. My inferiors! I think it beneath me; and my\nsuperiors! I think it presumption; therefore, if this youthful heart is\nprotected by any of the divine rights, I never will betray my trust.”\n\nHe was aware that Ambulinia had a confidence that was, indeed, as firm\nand as resolute as she was beautiful and interesting. He hastened to the\ncottage of Louisa, who received him in her usual mode of pleasantness,\nand informed him that Ambulinia had just that moment left. “Is it\npossible?” said Elfonzo. “Oh, murdered hours! Why did she not remain and\nbe the guardian of my secrets? But hasten and tell me how she has stood\nthis trying scene, and what are her future determinations.” “You know,”\n said Louisa, “Major Elfonzo, that you have Ambulinia's first love, which\nis of no small consequence. She came here about twilight, and shed many\nprecious tears in consequence of her own fate with yours. We walked\nsilently in yon little valley you see, where we spent a momentary\nrepose. She seemed to be quite as determined as ever, and before we left\nthat beautiful spot she offered up a prayer to Heaven for thee.” “I will\nsee her then,” replied Elfonzo, “though legions of enemies may oppose.\nShe is mine by foreordination--she is mine by prophesy--she is mine\nby her own free will, and I will rescue her from the hands of her\noppressors. Will you not, Miss Louisa, assist me in my capture?”\n\n“I will certainly, by the aid of Divine Providence,” answered Louisa,\n“endeavor to break those slavish chains that bind the richest of prizes;\nthough allow me, Major, to entreat you to use no harsh means on this\nimportant occasion; take a decided stand, and write freely to Ambulinia\nupon this subject, and I will see that no intervening cause hinders its\npassage to her. God alone will save a mourning people. Now is the day\nand now is the hour to obey a command of such valuable worth.” The Major\nfelt himself grow stronger after this short interview with Louisa. He\nfelt as if he could whip his weight in wildcats--he knew he was master\nof his own feelings, and could now write a letter that would bring this\nlitigation to _an issue._\n\nCumming, January 24, 1844.\n\nDear Ambulinia--\n\nWe have now reached the most trying moment of our lives; we are pledged\nnot to forsake our trust; we have waited for a favorable hour to\ncome, thinking your friends would settle the matter agreeably among\nthemselves, and finally be reconciled to our marriage; but as I have\nwaited in vain, and looked in vain, I have determined in my own mind to\nmake a proposition to you, though you may think it not in accord with\nyour station, or compatible with your rank; yet, “sub hoc signo\nvinces.” You know I cannot resume my visits, in consequence of the utter\nhostility that your father has to me; therefore the consummation of\nour union will have to be sought for in a more sublime sphere, at the\nresidence of a respectable friend of this village. You cannot have\nany scruples upon this mode of proceeding, if you will but remember it\nemanates from one who loves you better than his own life--who is more\nthan anxious to bid you welcome to a new and happy home. Your warmest\nassociates say come; the talented, the learned, the wise, and the\nexperienced say come;--all these with their friends say, come. Viewing\nthese, with many other inducements, I flatter myself that you will come\nto the embraces of your Elfonzo; for now is the time of your acceptance\nof the day of your liberation. You cannot be ignorant, Ambulinia, that\nthou art the desire of my heart; its thoughts are too noble, and too\npure, to conceal themselves from you. I shall wait for your answer to\nthis impatiently, expecting that you will set the time to make your\ndeparture, and to be in readiness at a moment's warning to share the\njoys of a more preferable life. This will be handed to you by Louisa,\nwho will take a pleasure in communicating anything to you that may\nrelieve your dejected spirits, and will assure you that I now stand\nready, willing, and waiting to make good my vows.\n\nI am, dear Ambulinia, yours\n\ntruly, and forever,\n\nJ. I. Elfonzo.\n\nLouisa made it convenient to visit Mr. Valeer's, though they did not\nsuspect her in the least the bearer of love epistles; consequently,\nshe was invited in the room to console Ambulinia, where they were left\nalone. Ambulinia was seated by a small table--her head resting on her\nhand--her brilliant eyes were bathed in tears. Louisa handed her the\nletter of Elfonzo, when another spirit animated her features--the\nspirit of renewed confidence that never fails to strengthen the\nfemale character in an hour of grief and sorrow like this, and as she\npronounced the last accent of his name, she exclaimed, “And does he love\nme yet! I never will forget your generosity, Louisa. Oh, unhappy and yet\nblessed Louisa! may you never feel what I have felt--may you never know\nthe pangs of love. Had I never loved, I never would have been unhappy;\nbut I turn to Him who can save, and if His wisdom does not will my\nexpected union, I know He will give me strength to bear my lot. Amuse\nyourself with this little book, and take it as an apology for my\nsilence,” said Ambulinia, “while I attempt to answer this volume of\nconsolation.” “Thank you,” said Louisa, “you are excusable upon this\noccasion; but I pray you, Ambulinia, to be expert upon this momentous\nsubject, that there may be nothing mistrustful upon my part.” “I will,”\n said Ambulinia, and immediately resumed her seat and addressed the\nfollowing to Elfonzo:\n\nCumming, Ga., January 28, 1844.\n\nDevoted Elfonzo--\n\nI hail your letter as a welcome messenger of faith, and can now say\ntruly and firmly that my feelings correspond with yours. Nothing shall\nbe wanting on my part to make my obedience your fidelity. Courage and\nperseverance will accomplish success. Receive this as my oath, that\nwhile I grasp your hand in my own imagination, we stand united before a\nhigher tribunal than any on earth. All the powers of my life, soul, and\nbody, I devote to thee. Whatever dangers may threaten me, I fear not to\nencounter them. Perhaps I have determined upon my own destruction, by\nleaving the house of the best of parents; be it so; I flee to you; I\nshare your destiny, faithful to the end. The day that I have concluded\nupon for this task is _sabbath _next, when the family with the citizens\nare generally at church. For Heaven's sake let not that day pass\nunimproved: trust not till tomorrow, it is the cheat of life--the future\nthat never comes--the grave of many noble births--the cavern of ruined\nenterprise: which like the lightning's flash is born, and dies, and\nperishes, ere the voice of him who sees can cry, _behold! behold!!_ You\nmay trust to what I say, no power shall tempt me to betray confidence.\nSuffer me to add one word more.\n\n\nI will soothe thee, in all thy grief,\n\nBeside the gloomy river;\n\nAnd though thy love may yet be brief;\n\nMine is fixed forever.\n\nReceive the deepest emotions of my heart for thy constant love, and\nmay the power of inspiration be thy guide, thy portion, and thy all. In\ngreat haste,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAmbulinia.\n\n“I now take my leave of you, sweet girl,” said Louisa, “sincerely\nwishing you success on Sabbath next.” When Ambulinia's letter was handed\nto Elfonzo, he perused it without doubting its contents. Louisa charged\nhim to make but few confidants; but like most young men who happened to\nwin the heart of a beautiful girl, he was so elated with the idea that\nhe felt as a commanding general on parade, who had confidence in all,\nconsequently gave orders to all. The appointed Sabbath, with a delicious\nbreeze and cloudless sky, made its appearance. The people gathered in\ncrowds to the church--the streets were filled with neighboring citizens,\nall marching to the house of worship. It is entirely useless for me\nto attempt to describe the feelings of Elfonzo and Ambulinia, who were\nsilently watching the movements of the multitude, apparently counting\nthem as then entered the house of God, looking for the last one to\ndarken the door. The impatience and anxiety with which they waited,\nand the bliss they anticipated on the eventful day, is altogether\nindescribable. Those that have been so fortunate as to embark in such a\nnoble enterprise know all its realities; and those who have not had this\ninestimable privilege will have to taste its sweets before they can tell\nto others its joys, its comforts, and its Heaven-born worth. Immediately\nafter Ambulinia had assisted the family off to church, she took\nadvantage of that opportunity to make good her promises. She left a home\nof enjoyment to be wedded to one whose love had been justifiable. A few\nshort steps brought her to the presence of Louisa, who urged her to make\ngood use of her time, and not to delay a moment, but to go with her to\nher brother's house, where Elfonzo would forever make her happy. With\nlively speed, and yet a graceful air, she entered the door and found\nherself protected by the champion of her confidence. The necessary\narrangements were fast making to have the two lovers united--everything\nwas in readiness except the parson; and as they are generally very\nsanctimonious on such occasions, the news got to the parents of\nAmbulinia before the everlasting knot was tied, and they both came\nrunning, with uplifted hands and injured feelings, to arrest their\ndaughter from an unguarded and hasty resolution. Elfonzo desired to\nmaintain his ground, but Ambulinia thought it best for him to leave, to\nprepare for a greater contest. He accordingly obeyed, as it would have\nbeen a vain endeavor for him to have battled against a man who was armed\nwith deadly weapons; and besides, he could not resist the request of\nsuch a pure heart. Ambulinia concealed herself in the upper story of\nthe house, fearing the rebuke of her father; the door was locked, and no\nchastisement was now expected. Esquire Valeer, whose pride was already\ntouched, resolved to preserve the dignity of his family. He entered\nthe house almost exhausted, looking wildly for Ambulinia. “Amazed and\nastonished indeed I am,” said he, “at a people who call themselves\ncivilized, to allow such behavior as this. Ambulinia, Ambulinia!”\n he cried, “come to the calls of your first, your best, and your only\nfriend. I appeal to you, sir,” turning to the gentleman of the house,\n“to know where Ambulinia has gone, or where is she?” “Do you mean\nto insult me, sir, in my own house?” inquired the gentleman. “I will\nburst,” said Mr. V., “asunder every door in your dwelling, in search of\nmy daughter, if you do not speak quickly, and tell me where she is.\nI care nothing about that outcast rubbish of creation, that mean,\nlow-lived Elfonzo, if I can but obtain Ambulinia. Are you not going to\nopen this door?” said he. “By the Eternal that made Heaven and earth!\nI will go about the work instantly, if this is not done!” The confused\ncitizens gathered from all parts of the village, to know the cause of\nthis commotion. Some rushed into the house; the door that was locked\nflew open, and there stood Ambulinia, weeping. “Father, be still,” said\nshe, “and I will follow thee home.” But the agitated man seized her, and\nbore her off through the gazing multitude. “Father!” she exclaimed, “I\nhumbly beg your pardon--I will be dutiful--I will obey thy commands.\nLet the sixteen years I have lived in obedience to thee be my future\nsecurity.” “I don't like to be always giving credit, when the old score\nis not paid up, madam,” said the father. The mother followed almost in a\nstate of derangement, crying and imploring her to think beforehand, and\nask advice from experienced persons, and they would tell her it was a\nrash undertaking. “Oh!” said she, “Ambulinia, my daughter, did you know\nwhat I have suffered--did you know how many nights I have whiled away in\nagony, in pain, and in fear, you would pity the sorrows of a heartbroken\nmother.”\n\n“Well, mother,” replied Ambulinia, “I know I have been disobedient; I\nam aware that what I have done might have been done much better; but\noh! what shall I do with my honor? it is so dear to me; I am pledged\nto Elfonzo. His high moral worth is certainly worth some attention;\nmoreover, my vows, I have no doubt, are recorded in the book of life,\nand must I give these all up? must my fair hopes be forever blasted?\nForbid it, father; oh! forbid it, mother; forbid it, Heaven.” “I have\nseen so many beautiful skies overclouded,” replied the mother, “so many\nblossoms nipped by the frost, that I am afraid to trust you to the\ncare of those fair days, which may be interrupted by thundering and\ntempestuous nights. You no doubt think as I did--life's devious ways\nwere strewn with sweet-scented flowers, but ah! how long they have\nlingered around me and took their flight in the vivid hope that laughs\nat the drooping victims it has murdered.” Elfonzo was moved at this\nsight. The people followed on to see what was going to become of\nAmbulinia, while he, with downcast looks, kept at a distance, until he\nsaw them enter the abode of the father, thrusting her, that was the sigh\nof his soul, out of his presence into a solitary apartment, when she\nexclaimed, “Elfonzo! Elfonzo! oh, Elfonzo! where art thou, with all thy\nheroes? haste, oh! haste, come thou to my relief. Ride on the wings of\nthe wind! Turn thy force loose like a tempest, and roll on thy army like\na whirlwind, over this mountain of trouble and confusion. Oh, friends!\nif any pity me, let your last efforts throng upon the green hills, and\ncome to the relief of Ambulinia, who is guilty of nothing but innocent\nlove.” Elfonzo called out with a loud voice, “My God, can I stand this!\narise up, I beseech you, and put an end to this tyranny. Come, my brave\nboys,” said he, “are you ready to go forth to your duty?” They stood\naround him. “Who,” said he, “will call us to arms? Where are my\nthunderbolts of war? Speak ye, the first who will meet the foe! Who will\ngo forward with me in this ocean of grievous temptation? If there is\none who desires to go, let him come and shake hands upon the altar of\ndevotion, and swear that he will be a hero; yes, a Hector in a cause\nlike this, which calls aloud for a speedy remedy.” “Mine be the deed,”\n said a young lawyer, “and mine alone; Venus alone shall quit her station\nbefore I will forsake one jot or tittle of my promise to you; what\nis death to me? what is all this warlike army, if it is not to win a\nvictory? I love the sleep of the lover and the mighty; nor would I give\nit over till the blood of my enemies should wreak with that of my own.\nBut God forbid that our fame should soar on the blood of the slumberer.”\n Mr. Valeer stands at his door with the frown of a demon upon his brow,\nwith his dangerous weapon ready to strike the first man who should enter\nhis door. “Who will arise and go forward through blood and carnage\nto the rescue of my Ambulinia?” said Elfonzo. “All,” exclaimed the\nmultitude; and onward they went, with their implements of battle.\nOthers, of a more timid nature, stood among the distant hills to see the\nresult of the contest.\n\nElfonzo took the lead of his band. Night arose in clouds; darkness\nconcealed the heavens; but the blazing hopes that stimulated them\ngleamed in every bosom. All approached the anxious spot; they rushed to\nthe front of the house and, with one exclamation, demanded Ambulinia.\n“Away, begone, and disturb my peace no more,” said Mr. Valeer. “You are\na set of base, insolent, and infernal rascals. Go, the northern star\npoints your path through the dim twilight of the night; go, and vent\nyour spite upon the lonely hills; pour forth your love, you poor,\nweak-minded wretch, upon your idleness and upon your guitar, and your\nfiddle; they are fit subjects for your admiration, for let me assure\nyou, though this sword and iron lever are cankered, yet they frown in\nsleep, and let one of you dare to enter my house this night and you\nshall have the contents and the weight of these instruments.” “Never\nyet did base dishonor blur my name,” said Elfonzo; “mine is a cause of\nrenown; here are my warriors; fear and tremble, for this night, though\nhell itself should oppose, I will endeavor to avenge her whom thou hast\nbanished in solitude. The voice of Ambulinia shall be heard from that\ndark dungeon.” At that moment Ambulinia appeared at the window above,\nand with a tremulous voice said, “Live, Elfonzo! oh! live to raise my\nstone of moss! why should such language enter your heart? why should\nthy voice rend the air with such agitation? I bid thee live, once more\nremembering these tears of mine are shed alone for thee, in this dark\nand gloomy vault, and should I perish under this load of trouble, join\nthe song of thrilling accents with the raven above my grave, and lay\nthis tattered frame beside the banks of the Chattahoochee or the stream\nof Sawney's brook; sweet will be the song of death to your Ambulinia. My\nghost shall visit you in the smiles of Paradise, and tell your high\nfame to the minds of that region, which is far more preferable than this\nlonely cell. My heart shall speak for thee till the latest hour; I know\nfaint and broken are the sounds of sorrow, yet our souls, Elfonzo, shall\nhear the peaceful songs together. One bright name shall be ours on high,\nif we are not permitted to be united here; bear in mind that I still\ncherish my old sentiments, and the poet will mingle the names of Elfonzo\nand Ambulinia in the tide of other days.” “Fly, Elfonzo,” said the\nvoices of his united band, “to the wounded heart of your beloved. All\nenemies shall fall beneath thy sword. Fly through the clefts, and the\ndim spark shall sleep in death.” Elfonzo rushes forward and strikes\nhis shield against the door, which was barricaded, to prevent any\nintercourse. His brave sons throng around him. The people pour along\nthe streets, both male and female, to prevent or witness the melancholy\nscene.\n\n“To arms, to arms!” cried Elfonzo; “here is a victory to be won, a prize\nto be gained that is more to me that the whole world beside.” “It\ncannot be done tonight,” said Mr. Valeer. “I bear the clang of death; my\nstrength and armor shall prevail. My Ambulinia shall rest in this hall\nuntil the break of another day, and if we fall, we fall together. If we\ndie, we die clinging to our tattered rights, and our blood alone shall\ntell the mournful tale of a murdered daughter and a ruined father.” Sure\nenough, he kept watch all night, and was successful in defending his\nhouse and family. The bright morning gleamed upon the hills, night\nvanished away, the Major and his associates felt somewhat ashamed that\nthey had not been as fortunate as they expected to have been; however,\nthey still leaned upon their arms in dispersed groups; some were walking\nthe streets, others were talking in the Major's behalf. Many of\nthe citizen suspended business, as the town presented nothing but\nconsternation. A novelty that might end in the destruction of some\nworthy and respectable citizens. Mr. Valeer ventured in the streets,\nthough not without being well armed. Some of his friends congratulated\nhim on the decided stand he had taken, and hoped he would settle the\nmatter amicably with Elfonzo, without any serious injury. “Me,” he\nreplied, “what, me, condescend to fellowship with a coward, and a\nlow-lived, lazy, undermining villain? no, gentlemen, this cannot be; I\nhad rather be borne off, like the bubble upon the dark blue ocean, with\nAmbulinia by my side, than to have him in the ascending or descending\nline of relationship. Gentlemen,” continued he, “if Elfonzo is so much\nof a distinguished character, and is so learned in the fine arts, why do\nyou not patronize such men? why not introduce him into your families, as\na gentleman of taste and of unequaled magnanimity? why are you so very\nanxious that he should become a relative of mine? Oh, gentlemen, I fear\nyou yet are tainted with the curiosity of our first parents, who were\nbeguiled by the poisonous kiss of an old ugly serpent, and who, for\none _apple, damned_ all mankind. I wish to divest myself, as far as\npossible, of that untutored custom. I have long since learned that the\nperfection of wisdom, and the end of true philosophy, is to proportion\nour wants to our possessions, our ambition to our capacities; we will\nthen be a happy and a virtuous people.” Ambulinia was sent off to\nprepare for a long and tedious journey. Her new acquaintances had been\ninstructed by her father how to treat her, and in what manner, and to\nkeep the anticipated visit entirely secret. Elfonzo was watching the\nmovements of everybody; some friends had told him of the plot that was\nlaid to carry off Ambulinia. At night, he rallied some two or three of\nhis forces, and went silently along to the stately mansion; a faint and\nglimmering light showed through the windows; lightly he steps to the\ndoor; there were many voices rallying fresh in fancy's eye; he tapped\nthe shutter; it was opened instantly, and he beheld once more, seated\nbeside several ladies, the hope of all his toils; he rushed toward\nher, she rose from her seat, rejoicing; he made one mighty grasp, when\nAmbulinia exclaimed, “Huzza for Major Elfonzo! I will defend myself and\nyou, too, with this conquering instrument I hold in my hand; huzza, I\nsay, I now invoke time's broad wing to shed around us some dewdrops of\nverdant spring.”\n\nBut the hour had not come for this joyous reunion; her friends struggled\nwith Elfonzo for some time, and finally succeeded in arresting her from\nhis hands. He dared not injure them, because they were matrons whose\ncourage needed no spur; she was snatched from the arms of Elfonzo, with\nso much eagerness, and yet with such expressive signification, that he\ncalmly withdrew from this lovely enterprise, with an ardent hope that he\nshould be lulled to repose by the zephyrs which whispered peace to his\nsoul. Several long days and nights passed unmolested, all seemed to have\ngrounded their arms of rebellion, and no callidity appeared to be going\non with any of the parties. Other arrangements were made by Ambulinia;\nshe feigned herself to be entirely the votary of a mother's care, and\nshe, by her graceful smiles, that manhood might claim his stern dominion\nin some other region, where such boisterous love was not so prevalent.\nThis gave the parents a confidence that yielded some hours of sober joy;\nthey believed that Ambulinia would now cease to love Elfonzo, and that\nher stolen affections would now expire with her misguided opinions. They\ntherefore declined the idea of sending her to a distant land. But oh!\nthey dreamed not of the rapture that dazzled the fancy of Ambulinia, who\nwould say, when alone, youth should not fly away on his rosy pinions,\nand leave her to grapple in the conflict with unknown admirers.\n\n\nNo frowning age shall control\n\nThe constant current of my soul,\n\nNor a tear from pity's eye\n\nShall check my sympathetic sigh.\n\nWith this resolution fixed in her mind, one dark and dreary night, when\nthe winds whistled and the tempest roared, she received intelligence\nthat Elfonzo was then waiting, and every preparation was then ready, at\nthe residence of Dr. Tully, and for her to make a quick escape while\nthe family was reposing. Accordingly she gathered her books, went the\nwardrobe supplied with a variety of ornamental dressing, and ventured\nalone in the streets to make her way to Elfonzo, who was near at hand,\nimpatiently looking and watching her arrival. “What forms,” said she,\n“are those rising before me? What is that dark spot on the clouds? I do\nwonder what frightful ghost that is, gleaming on the red tempest? Oh,\nbe merciful and tell me what region you are from. Oh, tell me, ye strong\nspirits, or ye dark and fleeting clouds, that I yet have a friend.” “A\nfriend,” said a low, whispering voice. “I am thy unchanging, thy aged,\nand thy disappointed mother. Why brandish in that hand of thine a\njavelin of pointed steel? Why suffer that lip I have kissed a thousand\ntimes to equivocate? My daughter, let these tears sink deep into thy\nsoul, and no longer persist in that which may be your destruction and\nruin. Come, my dear child, retract your steps, and bear me company to\nyour welcome home.” Without one retorting word, or frown from her brow,\nshe yielded to the entreaties of her mother, and with all the mildness\nof her former character she went along with the silver lamp of age, to\nthe home of candor and benevolence. Her father received her cold and\nformal politeness--“Where has Ambulinia been, this blustering evening,\nMrs. Valeer?” inquired he. “Oh, she and I have been taking a solitary\nwalk,” said the mother; “all things, I presume, are now working for the\nbest.”\n\nElfonzo heard this news shortly after it happened. “What,” said he,\n“has heaven and earth turned against me? I have been disappointed times\nwithout number. Shall I despair?--must I give it over? Heaven's decrees\nwill not fade; I will write again--I will try again; and if it traverses\na gory field, I pray forgiveness at the altar of justice.”\n\nDesolate Hill, Cumming, Geo., 1844.\n\nUnconquered and Beloved Ambulinia-- I have only time to say to you, not\nto despair; thy fame shall not perish; my visions are brightening before\nme. The whirlwind's rage is past, and we now shall subdue our enemies\nwithout doubt. On Monday morning, when your friends are at breakfast,\nthey will not suspect your departure, or even mistrust me being in town,\nas it has been reported advantageously that I have left for the west.\nYou walk carelessly toward the academy grove, where you will find me\nwith a lightning steed, elegantly equipped to bear you off where we\nshall be joined in wedlock with the first connubial rights. Fail not\nto do this--think not of the tedious relations of our wrongs--be\ninvincible. You alone occupy all my ambition, and I alone will make you\nmy happy spouse, with the same unimpeached veracity. I remain, forever,\nyour devoted friend and admirer, J. I. Elfonzo.\n\nThe appointed day ushered in undisturbed by any clouds; nothing\ndisturbed Ambulinia's soft beauty. With serenity and loveliness she\nobeys the request of Elfonzo. The moment the family seated themselves\nat the table--“Excuse my absence for a short time,” said she, “while I\nattend to the placing of those flowers, which should have been done\na week ago.” And away she ran to the sacred grove, surrounded with\nglittering pearls, that indicated her coming. Elfonzo hails her with\nhis silver bow and his golden harp. They meet--Ambulinia's countenance\nbrightens--Elfonzo leads up his winged steed. “Mount,” said he, “ye\ntrue-hearted, ye fearless soul--the day is ours.” She sprang upon the\nback of the young thunder bolt, a brilliant star sparkles upon her head,\nwith one hand she grasps the reins, and with the other she holds an\nolive branch. “Lend thy aid, ye strong winds,” they exclaimed, “ye moon,\nye sun, and all ye fair host of heaven, witness the enemy conquered.”\n “Hold,” said Elfonzo, “thy dashing steed.” “Ride on,” said Ambulinia,\n“the voice of thunder is behind us.” And onward they went, with such\nrapidity that they very soon arrived at Rural Retreat, where they\ndismounted, and were united with all the solemnities that usually attend\nsuch divine operations. They passed the day in thanksgiving and great\nrejoicing, and on that evening they visited their uncle, where many of\ntheir friends and acquaintances had gathered to congratulate them in the\nfield of untainted bliss. The kind old gentleman met them in the yard:\n“Well,” said he, “I wish I may die, Elfonzo, if you and Ambulinia\nhaven't tied a knot with your tongue that you can't untie with your\nteeth. But come in, come in, never mind, all is right--the world still\nmoves on, and no one has fallen in this great battle.”\n\nHappy now is their lot! Unmoved by misfortune, they live among the fair\nbeauties of the South. Heaven spreads their peace and fame upon the arch\nof the rainbow, and smiles propitiously at their triumph, _through the\ntears of the storm._\n\n\n\nTHE CALIFORNIAN'S TALE\n\nThirty-five years ago I was out prospecting on the Stanislaus, tramping\nall day long with pick and pan and horn, and washing a hatful of dirt\nhere and there, always expecting to make a rich strike, and never doing\nit. It was a lovely region, woodsy, balmy, delicious, and had once been\npopulous, long years before, but now the people had vanished and the\ncharming paradise was a solitude. They went away when the surface\ndiggings gave out. In one place, where a busy little city with banks\nand newspapers and fire companies and a mayor and aldermen had been, was\nnothing but a wide expanse of emerald turf, with not even the faintest\nsign that human life had ever been present there. This was down toward\nTuttletown. In the country neighborhood thereabouts, along the dusty\nroads, one found at intervals the prettiest little cottage homes, snug\nand cozy, and so cobwebbed with vines snowed thick with roses that the\ndoors and windows were wholly hidden from sight--sign that these were\ndeserted homes, forsaken years ago by defeated and disappointed families\nwho could neither sell them nor give them away. Now and then, half an\nhour apart, one came across solitary log cabins of the earliest\nmining days, built by the first gold-miners, the predecessors of the\ncottage-builders. In some few cases these cabins were still occupied;\nand when this was so, you could depend upon it that the occupant was the\nvery pioneer who had built the cabin; and you could depend on another\nthing, too--that he was there because he had once had his opportunity\nto go home to the States rich, and had not done it; had rather lost\nhis wealth, and had then in his humiliation resolved to sever all\ncommunication with his home relatives and friends, and be to them\nthenceforth as one dead. Round about California in that day were\nscattered a host of these living dead men--pride-smitten poor fellows,\ngrizzled and old at forty, whose secret thoughts were made all of\nregrets and longings--regrets for their wasted lives, and longings to be\nout of the struggle and done with it all.\n\nIt was a lonesome land! Not a sound in all those peaceful expanses of\ngrass and woods but the drowsy hum of insects; no glimpse of man or\nbeast; nothing to keep up your spirits and make you glad to be alive.\nAnd so, at last, in the early part of the afternoon, when I caught sight\nof a human creature, I felt a most grateful uplift. This person was a\nman about forty-five years old, and he was standing at the gate of one\nof those cozy little rose-clad cottages of the sort already referred to.\nHowever, this one hadn't a deserted look; it had the look of being lived\nin and petted and cared for and looked after; and so had its front yard,\nwhich was a garden of flowers, abundant, gay, and flourishing. I was\ninvited in, of course, and required to make myself at home--it was the\ncustom of the country.\n\nIt was delightful to be in such a place, after long weeks of daily and\nnightly familiarity with miners' cabins--with all which this implies of\ndirt floor, never-made beds, tin plates and cups, bacon and beans and\nblack coffee, and nothing of ornament but war pictures from the\nEastern illustrated papers tacked to the log walls. That was all hard,\ncheerless, materialistic desolation, but here was a nest which had\naspects to rest the tired eye and refresh that something in one's nature\nwhich, after long fasting, recognizes, when confronted by the\nbelongings of art, howsoever cheap and modest they may be, that it has\nunconsciously been famishing and now has found nourishment. I could not\nhave believed that a rag carpet could feast me so, and so content me;\nor that there could be such solace to the soul in wall-paper and framed\nlithographs, and bright-colored tidies and lamp-mats, and Windsor\nchairs, and varnished what-nots, with sea-shells and books and china\nvases on them, and the score of little unclassifiable tricks and touches\nthat a woman's hand distributes about a home, which one sees without\nknowing he sees them, yet would miss in a moment if they were taken\naway. The delight that was in my heart showed in my face, and the man\nsaw it and was pleased; saw it so plainly that he answered it as if it\nhad been spoken.\n\n“All her work,” he said, caressingly; “she did it all herself--every\nbit,” and he took the room in with a glance which was full of\naffectionate worship. One of those soft Japanese fabrics with which\nwomen drape with careful negligence the upper part of a picture-frame\nwas out of adjustment. He noticed it, and rearranged it with cautious\npains, stepping back several times to gauge the effect before he got it\nto suit him. Then he gave it a light finishing pat or two with his hand,\nand said: “She always does that. You can't tell just what it lacks, but\nit does lack something until you've done that--you can see it yourself\nafter it's done, but that is all you know; you can't find out the law of\nit. It's like the finishing pats a mother gives the child's hair after\nshe's got it combed and brushed, I reckon. I've seen her fix all these\nthings so much that I can do them all just her way, though I don't know\nthe law of any of them. But she knows the law. She knows the why and the\nhow both; but I don't know the why; I only know the how.”\n\nHe took me into a bedroom so that I might wash my hands; such a bedroom\nas I had not seen for years: white counterpane, white pillows, carpeted\nfloor, papered walls, pictures, dressing-table, with mirror and\npin-cushion and dainty toilet things; and in the corner a wash-stand,\nwith real china-ware bowl and pitcher, and with soap in a china dish,\nand on a rack more than a dozen towels--towels too clean and white for\none out of practice to use without some vague sense of profanation. So\nmy face spoke again, and he answered with gratified words:\n\n“All her work; she did it all herself--every bit. Nothing here that\nhasn't felt the touch of her hand. Now you would think--But I mustn't\ntalk so much.”\n\nBy this time I was wiping my hands and glancing from detail to detail\nof the room's belongings, as one is apt to do when he is in a new place,\nwhere everything he sees is a comfort to his eye and his spirit; and\nI became conscious, in one of those unaccountable ways, you know, that\nthere was something there somewhere that the man wanted me to discover\nfor myself. I knew it perfectly, and I knew he was trying to help me by\nfurtive indications with his eye, so I tried hard to get on the right\ntrack, being eager to gratify him. I failed several times, as I could\nsee out of the corner of my eye without being told; but at last I knew I\nmust be looking straight at the thing--knew it from the pleasure issuing\nin invisible waves from him. He broke into a happy laugh, and rubbed his\nhands together, and cried out:\n\n“That's it! You've found it. I knew you would. It's her picture.”\n\nI went to the little black-walnut bracket on the farther wall, and\ndid find there what I had not yet noticed--a daguerreotype-case. It\ncontained the sweetest girlish face, and the most beautiful, as it\nseemed to me, that I had ever seen. The man drank the admiration from my\nface, and was fully satisfied.\n\n“Nineteen her last birthday,” he said, as he put the picture back; “and\nthat was the day we were married. When you see her--ah, just wait till\nyou see her!”\n\n“Where is she? When will she be in?”\n\n“Oh, she's away now. She's gone to see her people. They live forty or\nfifty miles from here. She's been gone two weeks today.”\n\n“When do you expect her back?”\n\n“This is Wednesday. She'll be back Saturday, in the evening--about nine\no'clock, likely.”\n\nI felt a sharp sense of disappointment.\n\n“I'm sorry, because I'll be gone then,” I said, regretfully.\n\n“Gone? No--why should you go? Don't go. She'll be disappointed.”\n\nShe would be disappointed--that beautiful creature! If she had said the\nwords herself they could hardly have blessed me more. I was feeling\na deep, strong longing to see her--a longing so supplicating, so\ninsistent, that it made me afraid. I said to myself: “I will go straight\naway from this place, for my peace of mind's sake.”\n\n“You see, she likes to have people come and stop with us--people who\nknow things, and can talk--people like you. She delights in it; for she\nknows--oh, she knows nearly everything herself, and can talk, oh, like\na bird--and the books she reads, why, you would be astonished. Don't go;\nit's only a little while, you know, and she'll be so disappointed.”\n\nI heard the words, but hardly noticed them, I was so deep in my\nthinkings and strugglings. He left me, but I didn't know. Presently he\nwas back, with the picture case in his hand, and he held it open before\nme and said:\n\n“There, now, tell her to her face you could have stayed to see her, and\nyou wouldn't.”\n\nThat second glimpse broke down my good resolution. I would stay and take\nthe risk. That night we smoked the tranquil pipe, and talked till late\nabout various things, but mainly about her; and certainly I had had no\nsuch pleasant and restful time for many a day. The Thursday followed and\nslipped comfortably away. Toward twilight a big miner from three miles\naway came--one of the grizzled, stranded pioneers--and gave us warm\nsalutation, clothed in grave and sober speech. Then he said:\n\n“I only just dropped over to ask about the little madam, and when is she\ncoming home. Any news from her?”\n\n“Oh, yes, a letter. Would you like to hear it, Tom?”\n\n“Well, I should think I would, if you don't mind, Henry!”\n\nHenry got the letter out of his wallet, and said he would skip some of\nthe private phrases, if we were willing; then he went on and read the\nbulk of it--a loving, sedate, and altogether charming and gracious\npiece of handiwork, with a postscript full of affectionate regards\nand messages to Tom, and Joe, and Charley, and other close friends and\nneighbors.\n\nAs the reader finished, he glanced at Tom, and cried out:\n\n“Oho, you're at it again! Take your hands away, and let me see your\neyes. You always do that when I read a letter from her. I will write and\ntell her.”\n\n“Oh no, you mustn't, Henry. I'm getting old, you know, and any little\ndisappointment makes me want to cry. I thought she'd be here herself,\nand now you've got only a letter.”\n\n“Well, now, what put that in your head? I thought everybody knew she\nwasn't coming till Saturday.”\n\n“Saturday! Why, come to think, I did know it. I wonder what's the matter\nwith me lately? Certainly I knew it. Ain't we all getting ready for her?\nWell, I must be going now. But I'll be on hand when she comes, old man!”\n\nLate Friday afternoon another gray veteran tramped over from his cabin a\nmile or so away, and said the boys wanted to have a little gaiety and\na good time Saturday night, if Henry thought she wouldn't be too tired\nafter her journey to be kept up.\n\n“Tired? She tired! Oh, hear the man! Joe, _you _know she'd sit up six\nweeks to please any one of you!”\n\nWhen Joe heard that there was a letter, he asked to have it read, and\nthe loving messages in it for him broke the old fellow all up; but he\nsaid he was such an old wreck that _that _would happen to him if she\nonly just mentioned his name. “Lord, we miss her so!” he said.\n\nSaturday afternoon I found I was taking out my watch pretty often. Henry\nnoticed it, and said, with a startled look:\n\n“You don't think she ought to be here soon, do you?”\n\nI felt caught, and a little embarrassed; but I laughed, and said it was\na habit of mine when I was in a state of expenctancy. But he didn't seem\nquite satisfied; and from that time on he began to show uneasiness. Four\ntimes he walked me up the road to a point whence we could see a long\ndistance; and there he would stand, shading his eyes with his hand, and\nlooking. Several times he said:\n\n“I'm getting worried, I'm getting right down worried. I know she's not\ndue till about nine o'clock, and yet something seems to be trying\nto warn me that something's happened. You don't think anything has\nhappened, do you?”\n\nI began to get pretty thoroughly ashamed of him for his childishness;\nand at last, when he repeated that imploring question still another\ntime, I lost my patience for the moment, and spoke pretty brutally to\nhim. It seemed to shrivel him up and cow him; and he looked so wounded\nand so humble after that, that I detested myself for having done the\ncruel and unnecessary thing. And so I was glad when Charley, another\nveteran, arrived toward the edge of the evening, and nestled up to\nHenry to hear the letter read, and talked over the preparations for the\nwelcome. Charley fetched out one hearty speech after another, and did\nhis best to drive away his friend's bodings and apprehensions.\n\n“Anything _happened _to her? Henry, that's pure nonsense. There isn't\nanything going to happen to her; just make your mind easy as to that.\nWhat did the letter say? Said she was well, didn't it? And said she'd\nbe here by nine o'clock, didn't it? Did you ever know her to fail of her\nword? Why, you know you never did. Well, then, don't you fret; she'll_\nbe_ here, and that's absolutely certain, and as sure as you are born.\nCome, now, let's get to decorating--not much time left.”\n\nPretty soon Tom and Joe arrived, and then all hands set about adorning\nthe house with flowers. Toward nine the three miners said that as they\nhad brought their instruments they might as well tune up, for the\nboys and girls would soon be arriving now, and hungry for a good,\nold-fashioned break-down. A fiddle, a banjo, and a clarinet--these were\nthe instruments. The trio took their places side by side, and began to\nplay some rattling dance-music, and beat time with their big boots.\n\nIt was getting very close to nine. Henry was standing in the door with\nhis eyes directed up the road, his body swaying to the torture of his\nmental distress. He had been made to drink his wife's health and safety\nseveral times, and now Tom shouted:\n\n“All hands stand by! One more drink, and she's here!”\n\nJoe brought the glasses on a waiter, and served the party. I reached for\none of the two remaining glasses, but Joe growled under his breath:\n\n“Drop that! Take the other.”\n\nWhich I did. Henry was served last. He had hardly swallowed his drink\nwhen the clock began to strike. He listened till it finished, his face\ngrowing pale and paler; then he said:\n\n“Boys, I'm sick with fear. Help me--I want to lie down!”\n\nThey helped him to the sofa. He began to nestle and drowse, but\npresently spoke like one talking in his sleep, and said: “Did I hear\nhorses' feet? Have they come?”\n\nOne of the veterans answered, close to his ear: “It was Jimmy Parish\ncome to say the party got delayed, but they're right up the road a\npiece, and coming along. Her horse is lame, but she'll be here in half\nan hour.”\n\n“Oh, I'm_ so_ thankful nothing has happened!”\n\nHe was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth. In a moment\nthose handy men had his clothes off, and had tucked him into his bed in\nthe chamber where I had washed my hands. They closed the door and came\nback. Then they seemed preparing to leave; but I said: “Please don't go,\ngentlemen. She won't know me; I am a stranger.”\n\nThey glanced at each other. Then Joe said:\n\n“She? Poor thing, she's been dead nineteen years!”\n\n“Dead?”\n\n“That or worse. She went to see her folks half a year after she was\nmarried, and on her way back, on a Saturday evening, the Indians\ncaptured her within five miles of this place, and she's never been heard\nof since.”\n\n“And he lost his mind in consequence?”\n\n“Never has been sane an hour since. But he only gets bad when that time\nof year comes round. Then we begin to drop in here, three days before\nshe's due, to encourage him up, and ask if he's heard from her,\nand Saturday we all come and fix up the house with flowers, and get\neverything ready for a dance. We've done it every year for nineteen\nyears. The first Saturday there was twenty-seven of us, without counting\nthe girls; there's only three of us now, and the girls are gone. We\ndrug him to sleep, or he would go wild; then he's all right for another\nyear--thinks she's with him till the last three or four days come round;\nthen he begins to look for her, and gets out his poor old letter, and we\ncome and ask him to read it to us. Lord, she was a darling!”\n\n\n\nA HELPLESS SITUATION\n\nOnce or twice a year I get a letter of a certain pattern, a pattern that\nnever materially changes, in form and substance, yet I cannot get used\nto that letter--it always astonishes me. It affects me as the locomotive\nalways affects me: I say to myself, “I have seen you a thousand times,\nyou always look the same way, yet you are always a wonder, and you are\nalways impossible; to contrive you is clearly beyond human genius--you\ncan't exist, you don't exist, yet here you are!”\n\nI have a letter of that kind by me, a very old one. I yearn to print it,\nand where is the harm? The writer of it is dead years ago, no doubt, and\nif I conceal her name and address--her this-world address--I am sure\nher shade will not mind. And with it I wish to print the answer which\nI wrote at the time but probably did not send. If it went--which is not\nlikely--it went in the form of a copy, for I find the original still\nhere, pigeonholed with the said letter. To that kind of letters we all\nwrite answers which we do not send, fearing to hurt where we have no\ndesire to hurt; I have done it many a time, and this is doubtless a case\nof the sort.\n\nTHE LETTER\n\nX------, California, JUNE 3, 1879.\n\nMr. S. L. Clemens, HARTFORD, CONN.:\n\nDear Sir,--You will doubtless be surprised to know who has presumed to\nwrite and ask a favor of you. Let your memory go back to your days in\nthe Humboldt mines--'62-'63. You will remember, you and Clagett and\nOliver and the old blacksmith Tillou lived in a lean-to which was\nhalf-way up the gulch, and there were six log cabins in the camp--strung\npretty well separated up the gulch from its mouth at the desert to where\nthe last claim was, at the divide. The lean-to you lived in was the one\nwith a canvas roof that the cow fell down through one night, as told\nabout by you in _Roughing It_--my uncle Simmons remembers it very well.\nHe lived in the principal cabin, half-way up the divide, along with\nDixon and Parker and Smith. It had two rooms, one for kitchen and the\nother for bunks, and was the only one that had. You and your party\nwere there on the great night, the time they had dried-apple-pie, Uncle\nSimmons often speaks of it. It seems curious that dried-apple-pie\nshould have seemed such a great thing, but it was, and it shows how far\nHumboldt was out of the world and difficult to get to, and how slim the\nregular bill of fare was. Sixteen years ago--it is a long time. I was a\nlittle girl then, only fourteen. I never saw you, I lived in Washoe. But\nUncle Simmons ran across you every now and then, all during those weeks\nthat you and party were there working your claim which was like the\nrest. The camp played out long and long ago, there wasn't silver enough\nin it to make a button. You never saw my husband, but he was there after\nyou left, _and lived in that very lean-to_, a bachelor then but married\nto me now. He often wishes there had been a photographer there in\nthose days, he would have taken the lean-to. He got hurt in the old Hal\nClayton claim that was abandoned like the others, putting in a blast and\nnot climbing out quick enough, though he scrambled the best he could.\nIt landed him clear down on the train and hit a Piute. For weeks they\nthought he would not get over it but he did, and is all right, now. Has\nbeen ever since. This is a long introduction but it is the only way\nI can make myself known. The favor I ask I feel assured your generous\nheart will grant: Give me some advice about a book I have written. I do\nnot claim anything for it only it is mostly true and as interesting as\nmost of the books of the times. I am unknown in the literary world and\nyou know what that means unless one has some one of influence (like\nyourself) to help you by speaking a good word for you. I would like to\nplace the book on royalty basis plan with any one you would suggest.\n\nThis is a secret from my husband and family. I intend it as a surprise\nin case I get it published.\n\nFeeling you will take an interest in this and if possible write me a\nletter to some publisher, or, better still, if you could see them for me\nand then let me hear.\n\nI appeal to you to grant me this favor. With deepest gratitude I think\nyou for your attention.\n\nOne knows, without inquiring, that the twin of that embarrassing letter\nis forever and ever flying in this and that and the other direction\nacross the continent in the mails, daily, nightly, hourly, unceasingly,\nunrestingly. It goes to every well-known merchant, and railway official,\nand manufacturer, and capitalist, and Mayor, and Congressman, and\nGovernor, and editor, and publisher, and author, and broker, and\nbanker--in a word, to every person who is supposed to have “influence.”\n It always follows the one pattern: “You do not know me, _but you once\nknew a relative of mine,_” etc., etc. We should all like to help the\napplicants, we should all be glad to do it, we should all like to return\nthe sort of answer that is desired, but--Well, there is not a thing we\ncan do that would be a help, for not in any instance does that latter\never come from anyone who _can _be helped. The struggler whom you _could\n_help does his own helping; it would not occur to him to apply to you,\nstranger. He has talent and knows it, and he goes into his fight eagerly\nand with energy and determination--all alone, preferring to be alone.\nThat pathetic letter which comes to you from the incapable, the\nunhelpable--how do you who are familiar with it answer it? What do you\nfind to say? You do not want to inflict a wound; you hunt ways to avoid\nthat. What do you find? How do you get out of your hard place with a\ncontent conscience? Do you try to explain? The old reply of mine to such\na letter shows that I tried that once. Was I satisfied with the result?\nPossibly; and possibly not; probably not; almost certainly not. I have\nlong ago forgotten all about it. But, anyway, I append my effort:\n\nTHE REPLY\n\nI know Mr. H., and I will go to him, dear madam, if upon reflection you\nfind you still desire it. There will be a conversation. I know the form\nit will take. It will be like this:\n\nMR. H. How do her books strike you?\n\nMR. CLEMENS. I am not acquainted with them.\n\nH. Who has been her publisher?\n\nC. I don't know.\n\nH. She _has _one, I suppose?\n\nC. I--I think not.\n\nH. Ah. You think this is her first book?\n\nC. Yes--I suppose so. I think so.\n\nH. What is it about? What is the character of it?\n\nC. I believe I do not know.\n\nH. Have you seen it?\n\nC. Well--no, I haven't.\n\nH. Ah-h. How long have you known her?\n\nC. I don't know her.\n\nH. Don't know her?\n\nC. No.\n\nH. Ah-h. How did you come to be interested in her book, then?\n\nC. Well, she--she wrote and asked me to find a publisher for her, and\nmentioned you.\n\nH. Why should she apply to you instead of me?\n\nC. She wished me to use my influence.\n\nH. Dear me, what has _influence _to do with such a matter?\n\nC. Well, I think she thought you would be more likely to examine her\nbook if you were influenced.\n\nH. Why, what we are here _for _is to examine books--anybody's book\nthat comes along. It's our _business_. Why should we turn away a book\nunexamined because it's a stranger's? It would be foolish. No publisher\ndoes it. On what ground did she request your influence, since you do not\nknow her? She must have thought you knew her literature and could speak\nfor it. Is that it?\n\nC. No; she knew I didn't.\n\nH. Well, what then? She had a reason of _some _sort for believing you\ncompetent to recommend her literature, and also under obligations to do\nit?\n\nC. Yes, I--I knew her uncle.\n\nH. Knew her _uncle_?\n\nC. Yes.\n\nH. Upon my word! So, you knew her uncle; her uncle knows her literature;\nhe endorses it to you; the chain is complete, nothing further needed;\nyou are satisfied, and therefore--\n\nC._ No_, that isn't all, there are other ties. I know the cabin her\nuncle lived in, in the mines; I knew his partners, too; also I came\nnear knowing her husband before she married him, and I _did _know the\nabandoned shaft where a premature blast went off and he went flying\nthrough the air and clear down to the trail and hit an Indian in the\nback with almost fatal consequences.\n\nH. To _him_, or to the Indian?\n\nC. She didn't say which it was.\n\nH. (_With a sigh_). It certainly beats the band! You don't know _her_,\nyou don't know her literature, you don't know who got hurt when the\nblast went off, you don't know a single thing for us to build an\nestimate of her book upon, so far as I--\n\nC. I knew her uncle. You are forgetting her uncle.\n\nH. Oh, what use is_ he_? Did you know him long? How long was it?\n\nC. Well, I don't know that I really knew him, but I must have met him,\nanyway. I think it was that way; you can't tell about these things, you\nknow, except when they are recent.\n\nH. Recent? When was all this?\n\nC. Sixteen years ago.\n\nH. What a basis to judge a book upon! As first you said you knew him,\nand now you don't know whether you did or not.\n\nC. Oh yes, I know him; anyway, I think I thought I did; I'm perfectly\ncertain of it.\n\nH. What makes you think you thought you knew him?\n\nC. Why, she says I did, herself.\n\nH._ She_ says so!\n\nC. Yes, she does, and I _did _know him, too, though I don't remember it\nnow.\n\nH. Come--how can you know it when you don't remember it.\n\nC. _I_ don't know. That is, I don't know the process, but I_ do_ know\nlots of things that I don't remember, and remember lots of things that I\ndon't know. It's so with every educated person.\n\nH. (_After a pause_). Is your time valuable?\n\nC. No--well, not very.\n\nH. Mine is.\n\nSo I came away then, because he was looking tired. Overwork, I reckon; I\nnever do that; I have seen the evil effects of it. My mother was always\nafraid I would overwork myself, but I never did.\n\nDear madam, you see how it would happen if I went there. He would ask\nme those questions, and I would try to answer them to suit him, and he\nwould hunt me here and there and yonder and get me embarrassed more\nand more all the time, and at last he would look tired on account of\noverwork, and there it would end and nothing done. I wish I could be\nuseful to you, but, you see, they do not care for uncles or any of those\nthings; it doesn't move them, it doesn't have the least effect, they\ndon't care for anything but the literature itself, and they as good as\ndespise influence. But they do care for books, and are eager to get them\nand examine them, no matter whence they come, nor from whose pen. If you\nwill send yours to a publisher--any publisher--he will certainly examine\nit, I can assure you of that.\n\n\n\nA TELEPHONIC CONVERSATION\n\nConsider that a conversation by telephone--when you are simply sitting\nby and not taking any part in that conversation--is one of the solemnest\ncuriosities of modern life. Yesterday I was writing a deep article on a\nsublime philosophical subject while such a conversation was going on\nin the room. I notice that one can always write best when somebody is\ntalking through a telephone close by. Well, the thing began in this way.\nA member of our household came in and asked me to have our house put\ninto communication with Mr. Bagley's downtown. I have observed, in many\ncities, that the sex always shrink from calling up the central office\nthemselves. I don't know why, but they do. So I touched the bell, and\nthis talk ensued:\n\n_Central Office. (Gruffly.)_ Hello!\n\nI. Is it the Central Office?\n\nC. O. Of course it is. What do you want?\n\nI. Will you switch me on to the Bagleys, please?\n\nC. O. All right. Just keep your ear to the telephone.\n\nThen I heard _k-look, k-look, k'look--klook-klook-klook-look-look!_ then a\nhorrible “gritting” of teeth, and finally a piping female voice: Y-e-s?\n(_Rising inflection._) Did you wish to speak to me?\n\nWithout answering, I handed the telephone to the applicant, and sat\ndown. Then followed that queerest of all the queer things in this\nworld--a conversation with only one end to it. You hear questions asked;\nyou don't hear the answer. You hear invitations given; you hear no\nthanks in return. You have listening pauses of dead silence, followed by\napparently irrelevant and unjustifiable exclamations of glad surprise or\nsorrow or dismay. You can't make head or tail of the talk, because you\nnever hear anything that the person at the other end of the wire says.\nWell, I heard the following remarkable series of observations, all from\nthe one tongue, and all shouted--for you can't ever persuade the sex to\nspeak gently into a telephone:\n\nYes? Why, how did _that _happen?\n\nPause.\n\nWhat did you say?\n\nPause.\n\nOh no, I don't think it was.\n\nPause.\n\n_ No_! Oh no, I didn't mean _that_. I meant, put it in while it is still\nboiling--or just before it _comes _to a boil.\n\nPause.\n\n_What_?\n\nPause.\n\nI turned it over with a backstitch on the selvage edge.\n\nPause.\n\nYes, I like that way, too; but I think it's better to baste it on with\nValenciennes or bombazine, or something of that sort. It gives it such\nan air--and attracts so much noise.\n\nPause.\n\nIt's forty-ninth Deuteronomy, sixty-forth to ninety-seventh inclusive. I\nthink we ought all to read it often.\n\nPause.\n\nPerhaps so; I generally use a hair pin.\n\nPause.\n\nWhat did you say? (_Aside_.) Children, do be quiet!\n\nPause\n\n_Oh!_ B _flat!_ Dear me, I thought you said it was the cat!\n\nPause.\n\nSince _when_?\n\nPause.\n\nWhy, _I_ never heard of it.\n\nPause.\n\nYou astound me! It seems utterly impossible!\n\nPause.\n\n_Who _did?\n\nPause.\n\nGood-ness gracious!\n\nPause.\n\nWell, what_ is_ this world coming to? Was it right in _church_?\n\nPause.\n\nAnd was her _mother _there?\n\nPause.\n\nWhy, Mrs. Bagley, I should have died of humiliation! What did they_ do_?\n\nLong pause.\n\nI can't be perfectly sure, because I haven't the notes by me; but\nI think it goes something like this: te-rolly-loll-loll, loll\nlolly-loll-loll, O tolly-loll-loll-_lee-ly-li_-i-do! And then _repeat_,\nyou know.\n\nPause.\n\nYes, I think it_ is_ very sweet--and very solemn and impressive, if you\nget the andantino and the pianissimo right.\n\nPause.\n\nOh, gum-drops, gum-drops! But I never allow them to eat striped candy.\nAnd of course they _can't_, till they get their teeth, anyway.\n\nPause.\n\n_What_?\n\nPause.\n\nOh, not in the least--go right on. He's here writing--it doesn't bother\n_him_.\n\nPause.\n\nVery well, I'll come if I canI'll come if I can. (_Aside_.) Dear me, how it does tire a\nperson's arm to hold this thing up so long! I wish she'd--\n\nPause.\n\nOh no, not at all; I _like _to talk--but I'm afraid I'm keeping you from\nyour affairs.\n\nPause.\n\nVisitors?\n\nPause.\n\nNo, we never use butter on them.\n\nPause.\n\nYes, that is a very good way; but all the cook-books say they are very\nunhealthy when they are out of season. And_ he_ doesn't like them,\nanyway--especially canned.\n\nPause.\n\nOh, I think that is too high for them; we have never paid over fifty\ncents a bunch.\n\nPause.\n\n_Must _you go? Well, _good_-by.\n\nPause.\n\nYes, I think so. _good_-by.\n\nPause.\n\nFour o'clock, then--I'll be ready. _good_-by.\n\nPause.\n\nThank you ever so much. _good_-by.\n\nPause.\n\nOh, not at all!--just as fresh--_which_? Oh, I'm glad to hear you say\nthat. _Good_-by.\n\n(Hangs up the telephone and says, “Oh, it _does _tire a person's arm\nso!”)\n\nA man delivers a single brutal “Good-by,” and that is the end of it.\nNot so with the gentle sex--I say it in their praise; they cannot abide\nabruptness.\n\n\n\nEDWARD MILLS AND GEORGE BENTON: A TALE\n\nThese two were distantly related to each other--seventh cousins, or\nsomething of that sort. While still babies they became orphans, and were\nadopted by the Brants, a childless couple, who quickly grew very fond\nof them. The Brants were always saying: “Be pure, honest, sober,\nindustrious, and considerate of others, and success in life is assured.”\n The children heard this repeated some thousands of times before they\nunderstood it; they could repeat it themselves long before they could\nsay the Lord's Prayer; it was painted over the nursery door, and was\nabout the first thing they learned to read. It was destined to be the\nunswerving rule of Edward Mills's life. Sometimes the Brants changed\nthe wording a little, and said: “Be pure, honest, sober, industrious,\nconsiderate, and you will never lack friends.”\n\nBaby Mills was a comfort to everybody about him. When he wanted candy\nand could not have it, he listened to reason, and contented himself\nwithout it. When Baby Benton wanted candy, he cried for it until he got\nit. Baby Mills took care of his toys; Baby Benton always destroyed his\nin a very brief time, and then made himself so insistently disagreeable\nthat, in order to have peace in the house, little Edward was persuaded\nto yield up his play-things to him.\n\nWhen the children were a little older, Georgie became a heavy expense\nin one respect: he took no care of his clothes; consequently, he shone\nfrequently in new ones, which was not the case with Eddie. The boys\ngrew apace. Eddie was an increasing comfort, Georgie an increasing\nsolicitude. It was always sufficient to say, in answer to Eddie's\npetitions, “I would rather you would not do it”--meaning swimming,\nskating, picnicking, berrying, circusing, and all sorts of things which\nboys delight in. But_ no_ answer was sufficient for Georgie; he had\nto be humored in his desires, or he would carry them with a high hand.\nNaturally, no boy got more swimming skating, berrying, and so forth than\nhe; no body ever had a better time. The good Brants did not allow the\nboys to play out after nine in summer evenings; they were sent to bed at\nthat hour; Eddie honorably remained, but Georgie usually slipped out\nof the window toward ten, and enjoyed himself until midnight. It seemed\nimpossible to break Georgie of this bad habit, but the Brants managed\nit at last by hiring him, with apples and marbles, to stay in. The good\nBrants gave all their time and attention to vain endeavors to regulate\nGeorgie; they said, with grateful tears in their eyes, that Eddie needed\nno efforts of theirs, he was so good, so considerate, and in all ways so\nperfect.\n\nBy and by the boys were big enough to work, so they were apprenticed to\na trade: Edward went voluntarily; George was coaxed and bribed. Edward\nworked hard and faithfully, and ceased to be an expense to the good\nBrants; they praised him, so did his master; but George ran away, and it\ncost Mr. Brant both money and trouble to hunt him up and get him back.\nBy and by he ran away again--more money and more trouble. He ran away\na third time--and stole a few things to carry with him. Trouble and\nexpense for Mr. Brant once more; and, besides, it was with the greatest\ndifficulty that he succeeded in persuading the master to let the youth\ngo unprosecuted for the theft.\n\nEdward worked steadily along, and in time became a full partner in his\nmaster's business. George did not improve; he kept the loving hearts of\nhis aged benefactors full of trouble, and their hands full of inventive\nactivities to protect him from ruin. Edward, as a boy, had interested\nhimself in Sunday-schools, debating societies, penny missionary affairs,\nanti-tobacco organizations, anti-profanity associations, and all such\nthings; as a man, he was a quiet but steady and reliable helper in the\nchurch, the temperance societies, and in all movements looking to\nthe aiding and uplifting of men. This excited no remark, attracted no\nattention--for it was his “natural bent.”\n\nFinally, the old people died. The will testified their loving pride in\nEdward, and left their little property to George--because he “needed\nit”; whereas, “owing to a bountiful Providence,” such was not the case\nwith Edward. The property was left to George conditionally: he must\nbuy out Edward's partner with it; else it must go to a benevolent\norganization called the Prisoner's Friend Society. The old people left\na letter, in which they begged their dear son Edward to take their place\nand watch over George, and help and shield him as they had done.\n\nEdward dutifully acquiesced, and George became his partner in the\nbusiness. He was not a valuable partner: he had been meddling with drink\nbefore; he soon developed into a constant tippler now, and his flesh and\neyes showed the fact unpleasantly. Edward had been courting a sweet\nand kindly spirited girl for some time. They loved each other dearly,\nand--But about this period George began to haunt her tearfully and\nimploringly, and at last she went crying to Edward, and said her high\nand holy duty was plain before her--she must not let her own selfish\ndesires interfere with it: she must marry “poor George” and “reform\nhim.” It would break her heart, she knew it would, and so on; but duty\nwas duty. So she married George, and Edward's heart came very near\nbreaking, as well as her own. However, Edward recovered, and married\nanother girl--a very excellent one she was, too.\n\nChildren came to both families. Mary did her honest best to reform her\nhusband, but the contract was too large. George went on drinking, and by\nand by he fell to misusing her and the little ones sadly. A great many\ngood people strove with George--they were always at it, in fact--but he\ncalmly took such efforts as his due and their duty, and did not mend his\nways. He added a vice, presently--that of secret gambling. He got deeply\nin debt; he borrowed money on the firm's credit, as quietly as he could,\nand carried this system so far and so successfully that one morning the\nsheriff took possession of the establishment, and the two cousins found\nthemselves penniless.\n\nTimes were hard, now, and they grew worse. Edward moved his family into\na garret, and walked the streets day and night, seeking work. He begged\nfor it, but it was really not to be had. He was astonished to see how\nsoon his face became unwelcome; he was astonished and hurt to see how\nquickly the ancient interest which people had had in him faded out and\ndisappeared. Still, he _must _get work; so he swallowed his chagrin, and\ntoiled on in search of it. At last he got a job of carrying bricks up a\nladder in a hod, and was a grateful man in consequence; but after that\n_nobody _knew him or cared anything about him. He was not able to keep\nup his dues in the various moral organizations to which he belonged,\nand had to endure the sharp pain of seeing himself brought under the\ndisgrace of suspension.\n\nBut the faster Edward died out of public knowledge and interest, the\nfaster George rose in them. He was found lying, ragged and drunk, in the\ngutter one morning. A member of the Ladies' Temperance Refuge fished him\nout, took him in hand, got up a subscription for him, kept him sober\na whole week, then got a situation for him. An account of it was\npublished.\n\nGeneral attention was thus drawn to the poor fellow, and a great many\npeople came forward and helped him toward reform with their countenance\nand encouragement. He did not drink a drop for two months, and meantime\nwas the pet of the good. Then he fell--in the gutter; and there was\ngeneral sorrow and lamentation. But the noble sisterhood rescued him\nagain. They cleaned him up, they fed him, they listened to the mournful\nmusic of his repentances, they got him his situation again. An account\nof this, also, was published, and the town was drowned in happy tears\nover the re-restoration of the poor beast and struggling victim of\nthe fatal bowl. A grand temperance revival was got up, and after some\nrousing speeches had been made the chairman said, impressively: “We are\nnot about to call for signers; and I think there is a spectacle in\nstore for you which not many in this house will be able to view with dry\neyes.” There was an eloquent pause, and then George Benton, escorted\nby a red-sashed detachment of the Ladies of the Refuge, stepped forward\nupon the platform and signed the pledge. The air was rent with applause,\nand everybody cried for joy. Everybody wrung the hand of the new convert\nwhen the meeting was over; his salary was enlarged next day; he was the\ntalk of the town, and its hero. An account of it was published.\n\nGeorge Benton fell, regularly, every three months, but was faithfully\nrescued and wrought with, every time, and good situations were found for\nhim. Finally, he was taken around the country lecturing, as a reformed\ndrunkard, and he had great houses and did an immense amount of good.\n\nHe was so popular at home, and so trusted--during his sober\nintervals--that he was enabled to use the name of a principal citizen,\nand get a large sum of money at the bank. A mighty pressure was brought\nto bear to save him from the consequences of his forgery, and it was\npartially successful--he was “sent up” for only two years. When, at the\nend of a year, the tireless efforts of the benevolent were crowned\nwith success, and he emerged from the penitentiary with a pardon in\nhis pocket, the Prisoner's Friend Society met him at the door with a\nsituation and a comfortable salary, and all the other benevolent people\ncame forward and gave him advice, encouragement and help. Edward Mills\nhad once applied to the Prisoner's Friend Society for a situation, when\nin dire need, but the question, “Have you been a prisoner?” made brief\nwork of his case.\n\nWhile all these things were going on, Edward Mills had been quietly\nmaking head against adversity. He was still poor, but was in receipt of\na steady and sufficient salary, as the respected and trusted cashier\nof a bank. George Benton never came near him, and was never heard to\ninquire about him. George got to indulging in long absences from the\ntown; there were ill reports about him, but nothing definite.\n\nOne winter's night some masked burglars forced their way into the bank,\nand found Edward Mills there alone. They commanded him to reveal the\n“combination,” so that they could get into the safe. He refused. They\nthreatened his life. He said his employers trusted him, and he could not\nbe traitor to that trust. He could die, if he must, but while he lived\nhe would be faithful; he would not yield up the “combination.” The\nburglars killed him.\n\nThe detectives hunted down the criminals; the chief one proved to be\nGeorge Benton. A wide sympathy was felt for the widow and orphans of the\ndead man, and all the newspapers in the land begged that all the banks\nin the land would testify their appreciation of the fidelity and heroism\nof the murdered cashier by coming forward with a generous contribution\nof money in aid of his family, now bereft of support. The result was\na mass of solid cash amounting to upward of five hundred dollars--an\naverage of nearly three-eights of a cent for each bank in the Union. The\ncashier's own bank testified its gratitude by endeavoring to show (but\nhumiliatingly failed in it) that the peerless servant's accounts were\nnot square, and that he himself had knocked his brains out with a\nbludgeon to escape detection and punishment.\n\nGeorge Benton was arraigned for trial. Then everybody seemed to forget\nthe widow and orphans in their solicitude for poor George. Everything\nthat money and influence could do was done to save him, but it all\nfailed; he was sentenced to death. Straightway the Governor was besieged\nwith petitions for commutation or pardon; they were brought by tearful\nyoung girls; by sorrowful old maids; by deputations of pathetic widows;\nby shoals of impressive orphans. But no, the Governor--for once--would\nnot yield.\n\nNow George Benton experienced religion. The glad news flew all around.\nFrom that time forth his cell was always full of girls and women and\nfresh flowers; all the day long there was prayer, and hymn-singing,\nand thanksgiving, and homilies, and tears, with never an interruption,\nexcept an occasional five-minute intermission for refreshments.\n\nThis sort of thing continued up to the very gallows, and George Benton\nwent proudly home, in the black cap, before a wailing audience of the\nsweetest and best that the region could produce. His grave had fresh\nflowers on it every day, for a while, and the head-stone bore these\nwords, under a hand pointing aloft: “He has fought the good fight.”\n\nThe brave cashier's head-stone has this inscription: “Be pure, honest,\nsober, industrious, considerate, and you will never--”\n\nNobody knows who gave the order to leave it that way, but it was so\ngiven.\n\nThe cashier's family are in stringent circumstances, now, it is said;\nbut no matter; a lot of appreciative people, who were not willing that\nan act so brave and true as his should go unrewarded, have collected\nforty-two thousand dollars--and built a Memorial Church with it.\n\n\n\nTHE FIVE BOONS OF LIFE\n\n\n\nChapter I\n\nIn the morning of life came a good fairy with her basket, and said:\n\n“Here are gifts. Take one, leave the others. And be wary, choose wisely;\noh, choose wisely! for only one of them is valuable.”\n\nThe gifts were five: Fame, Love, Riches, Pleasure, Death. The youth\nsaid, eagerly:\n\n“There is no need to consider”; and he chose Pleasure.\n\nHe went out into the world and sought out the pleasures that youth\ndelights in. But each in its turn was short-lived and disappointing,\nvain and empty; and each, departing, mocked him. In the end he said:\n“These years I have wasted. If I could but choose again, I would choose\nwisely.”\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\nThe fairy appeared, and said:\n\n“Four of the gifts remain. Choose once more; and oh, remember--time is\nflying, and only one of them is precious.”\n\nThe man considered long, then chose Love; and did not mark the tears\nthat rose in the fairy's eyes.\n\nAfter many, many years the man sat by a coffin, in an empty home. And he\ncommuned with himself, saying: “One by one they have gone away and left\nme; and now she lies here, the dearest and the last. Desolation after\ndesolation has swept over me; for each hour of happiness the treacherous\ntrader, Love, has sold me I have paid a thousand hours of grief. Out of\nmy heart of hearts I curse him.”\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\n“Choose again.” It was the fairy speaking.\n\n“The years have taught you wisdom--surely it must be so. Three gifts\nremain. Only one of them has any worth--remember it, and choose warily.”\n\nThe man reflected long, then chose Fame; and the fairy, sighing, went\nher way.\n\nYears went by and she came again, and stood behind the man where he sat\nsolitary in the fading day, thinking. And she knew his thought:\n\n“My name filled the world, and its praises were on every tongue, and it\nseemed well with me for a little while. How little a while it was! Then\ncame envy; then detraction; then calumny; then hate; then persecution.\nThen derision, which is the beginning of the end. And last of all came\npity, which is the funeral of fame. Oh, the bitterness and misery of\nrenown! target for mud in its prime, for contempt and compassion in its\ndecay.”\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\n“Chose yet again.” It was the fairy's voice.\n\n“Two gifts remain. And do not despair. In the beginning there was but\none that was precious, and it is still here.”\n\n“Wealth--which is power! How blind I was!” said the man. “Now, at last,\nlife will be worth the living. I will spend, squander, dazzle. These\nmockers and despisers will crawl in the dirt before me, and I will feed\nmy hungry heart with their envy. I will have all luxuries, all joys, all\nenchantments of the spirit, all contentments of the body that man holds\ndear. I will buy, buy, buy! deference, respect, esteem, worship--every\npinchbeck grace of life the market of a trivial world can furnish forth.\nI have lost much time, and chosen badly heretofore, but let that pass; I\nwas ignorant then, and could but take for best what seemed so.”\n\nThree short years went by, and a day came when the man sat shivering in\na mean garret; and he was gaunt and wan and hollow-eyed, and clothed in\nrags; and he was gnawing a dry crust and mumbling:\n\n“Curse all the world's gifts, for mockeries and gilded lies! And\nmiscalled, every one. They are not gifts, but merely lendings. Pleasure,\nLove, Fame, Riches: they are but temporary disguises for lasting\nrealities--Pain, Grief, Shame, Poverty. The fairy said true; in all her\nstore there was but one gift which was precious, only one that was not\nvalueless. How poor and cheap and mean I know those others now to be,\ncompared with that inestimable one, that dear and sweet and kindly one,\nthat steeps in dreamless and enduring sleep the pains that persecute the\nbody, and the shames and griefs that eat the mind and heart. Bring it! I\nam weary, I would rest.”\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\nThe fairy came, bringing again four of the gifts, but Death was wanting.\nShe said:\n\n“I gave it to a mother's pet, a little child. It was ignorant, but\ntrusted me, asking me to choose for it. You did not ask me to choose.”\n\n“Oh, miserable me! What is left for me?”\n\n“What not even you have deserved: the wanton insult of Old Age.”\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST WRITING-MACHINES\n\nFrom My Unpublished Autobiography\n\nSome days ago a correspondent sent in an old typewritten sheet, faded by\nage, containing the following letter over the signature of Mark Twain:\n\n“Hartford, March 10, 1875.\n\n“Please do not use my name in any way. Please do not even divulge that\nfact that I own a machine. I have entirely stopped using the typewriter,\nfor the reason that I never could write a letter with it to anybody\nwithout receiving a request by return mail that I would not only\ndescribe the machine, but state what progress I had made in the use of\nit, etc., etc. I don't like to write letters, and so I don't want people\nto know I own this curiosity-breeding little joker.”\n\nA note was sent to Mr. Clemens asking him if the letter was genuine\nand whether he really had a typewriter as long ago as that. Mr.\nClemens replied that his best answer is the following chapter from his\nunpublished autobiography:\n\n1904. VILLA QUARTO, FLORENCE, JANUARY.\n\nDictating autobiography to a typewriter is a new experience for me, but\nit goes very well, and is going to save time and “language”--the kind of\nlanguage that soothes vexation.\n\nI have dictated to a typewriter before--but not autobiography. Between\nthat experience and the present one there lies a mighty gap--more than\nthirty years! It is a sort of lifetime. In that wide interval much\nhas happened--to the type-machine as well as to the rest of us. At the\nbeginning of that interval a type-machine was a curiosity. The person\nwho owned one was a curiosity, too. But now it is the other way about:\nthe person who _doesn't_ own one is a curiosity. I saw a type-machine\nfor the first time in--what year? I suppose it was 1873--because\nNasby was with me at the time, and it was in Boston. We must have been\nlecturing, or we could not have been in Boston, I take it. I quitted the\nplatform that season.\n\nBut never mind about that, it is no matter. Nasby and I saw the machine\nthrough a window, and went in to look at it. The salesman explained it\nto us, showed us samples of its work, and said it could do fifty-seven\nwords a minute--a statement which we frankly confessed that we did not\nbelieve. So he put his type-girl to work, and we timed her by the\nwatch. She actually did the fifty-seven in sixty seconds. We were partly\nconvinced, but said it probably couldn't happen again. But it did. We\ntimed the girl over and over again--with the same result always: she won\nout. She did her work on narrow slips of paper, and we pocketed them as\nfast as she turned them out, to show as curiosities. The price of the\nmachine was one hundred and twenty-five dollars. I bought one, and we\nwent away very much excited.\n\nAt the hotel we got out our slips and were a little disappointed to find\nthat they contained the same words. The girl had economized time\nand labor by using a formula which she knew by heart. However, we\nargued--safely enough--that the _first _type-girl must naturally take\nrank with the first billiard-player: neither of them could be expected\nto get out of the game any more than a third or a half of what was in\nit. If the machine survived--_if_ it survived--experts would come to the\nfront, by and by, who would double the girl's output without a doubt.\nThey would do one hundred words a minute--my talking speed on the\nplatform. That score has long ago been beaten.\n\nAt home I played with the toy, repeating and repeating and repeating\n“The Boy stood on the Burning Deck,” until I could turn that boy's\nadventure out at the rate of twelve words a minute; then I resumed the\npen, for business, and only worked the machine to astonish inquiring\nvisitors. They carried off many reams of the boy and his burning deck.\n\nBy and by I hired a young woman, and did my first dictating (letters,\nmerely), and my last until now. The machine did not do both capitals and\nlower case (as now), but only capitals. Gothic capitals they were, and\nsufficiently ugly. I remember the first letter I dictated, it was to\nEdward Bok, who was a boy then. I was not acquainted with him at that\ntime. His present enterprising spirit is not new--he had it in that\nearly day. He was accumulating autographs, and was not content with mere\nsignatures, he wanted a whole autograph _letter_. I furnished it--in\ntype-written capitals, _signature and all._ It was long; it was a\nsermon; it contained advice; also reproaches. I said writing was my\n_trade_, my bread-and-butter; I said it was not fair to ask a man\nto give away samples of his trade; would he ask the blacksmith for a\nhorseshoe? would he ask the doctor for a corpse?\n\nNow I come to an important matter--as I regard it. In the year '74\nthe young woman copied a considerable part of a book of mine _on the\nmachine_. In a previous chapter of this Autobiography I have claimed\nthat I was the first person in the world that ever had a telephone\nin the house for practical purposes; I will now claim--until\ndispossessed--that I was the first person in the world to _apply the\ntype-machine to literature_. That book must have been _The Adventures Of\nTom Sawyer._ I wrote the first half of it in '72, the rest of it in '74.\nMy machinist type-copied a book for me in '74, so I concluded it was\nthat one.\n\nThat early machine was full of caprices, full of defects--devilish ones.\nIt had as many immoralities as the machine of today has virtues. After\na year or two I found that it was degrading my character, so I thought\nI would give it to Howells. He was reluctant, for he was suspicious of\nnovelties and unfriendly toward them, and he remains so to this day. But\nI persuaded him. He had great confidence in me, and I got him to believe\nthings about the machine that I did not believe myself. He took it home\nto Boston, and my morals began to improve, but his have never recovered.\n\nHe kept it six months, and then returned it to me. I gave it away twice\nafter that, but it wouldn't stay; it came back. Then I gave it to our\ncoachman, Patrick McAleer, who was very grateful, because he did not\nknow the animal, and thought I was trying to make him wiser and better.\nAs soon as he got wiser and better he traded it to a heretic for a\nside-saddle which he could not use, and there my knowledge of its\nhistory ends.\n\n\n\nITALIAN WITHOUT A MASTER\n\nIt is almost a fortnight now that I am domiciled in a medieval villa in\nthe country, a mile or two from Florence. I cannot speak the language;\nI am too old now to learn how, also too busy when I am busy, and too\nindolent when I am not; wherefore some will imagine that I am having a\ndull time of it. But it is not so. The “help” are all natives; they talk\nItalian to me, I answer in English; I do not understand them, they\ndo not understand me, consequently no harm is done, and everybody is\nsatisfied. In order to be just and fair, I throw in an Italian word when\nI have one, and this has a good influence. I get the word out of the\nmorning paper. I have to use it while it is fresh, for I find that\nItalian words do not keep in this climate. They fade toward night, and\nnext morning they are gone. But it is no matter; I get a new one out of\nthe paper before breakfast, and thrill the domestics with it while it\nlasts. I have no dictionary, and I do not want one; I can select words\nby the sound, or by orthographic aspect. Many of them have French or\nGerman or English look, and these are the ones I enslave for the day's\nservice. That is, as a rule. Not always. If I find a learnable phrase\nthat has an imposing look and warbles musically along I do not care to\nknow the meaning of it; I pay it out to the first applicant, knowing\nthat if I pronounce it carefully_ he_ will understand it, and that's\nenough.\n\nYesterday's word was _avanti_. It sounds Shakespearian, and probably\nmeans Avaunt and quit my sight. Today I have a whole phrase: _sono\ndispiacentissimo_. I do not know what it means, but it seems to fit\nin everywhere and give satisfaction. Although as a rule my words and\nphrases are good for one day and train only, I have several that stay by\nme all the time, for some unknown reason, and these come very handy\nwhen I get into a long conversation and need things to fire up with\nin monotonous stretches. One of the best ones is _dov è il gatto_. It\nnearly always produces a pleasant surprise, therefore I save it up for\nplaces where I want to express applause or admiration. The fourth word\nhas a French sound, and I think the phrase means “that takes the cake.”\n\nDuring my first week in the deep and dreamy stillness of this woodsy\nand flowery place I was without news of the outside world, and was well\ncontent without it. It had been four weeks since I had seen a newspaper,\nand this lack seemed to give life a new charm and grace, and to saturate\nit with a feeling verging upon actual delight. Then came a change that\nwas to be expected: the appetite for news began to rise again, after\nthis invigorating rest. I had to feed it, but I was not willing to let\nit make me its helpless slave again; I determined to put it on a diet,\nand a strict and limited one. So I examined an Italian paper, with\nthe idea of feeding it on that, and on that exclusively. On that\nexclusively, and without help of a dictionary. In this way I should\nsurely be well protected against overloading and indigestion.\n\nA glance at the telegraphic page filled me with encouragement. There\nwere no scare-heads. That was good--supremely good. But there were\nheadings--one-liners and two-liners--and that was good too; for without\nthese, one must do as one does with a German paper--pay out precious\ntime in finding out what an article is about, only to discover, in many\ncases, that there is nothing in it of interest to you. The headline is a\nvaluable thing.\n\nNecessarily we are all fond of murders, scandals, swindles, robberies,\nexplosions, collisions, and all such things, when we know the people,\nand when they are neighbors and friends, but when they are strangers we\ndo not get any great pleasure out of them, as a rule. Now the trouble\nwith an American paper is that it has no discrimination; it rakes the\nwhole earth for blood and garbage, and the result is that you are daily\noverfed and suffer a surfeit. By habit you stow this muck every day, but\nyou come by and by to take no vital interest in it--indeed, you\nalmost get tired of it. As a rule, forty-nine-fiftieths of it concerns\nstrangers only--people away off yonder, a thousand miles, two thousand\nmiles, ten thousand miles from where you are. Why, when you come to\nthink of it, who cares what becomes of those people? I would not give\nthe assassination of one personal friend for a whole massacre of those\nothers. And, to my mind, one relative or neighbor mixed up in a scandal\nis more interesting than a whole Sodom and Gomorrah of outlanders gone\nrotten. Give me the home product every time.\n\nVery well. I saw at a glance that the Florentine paper would suit me:\nfive out of six of its scandals and tragedies were local; they were\nadventures of one's very neighbors, one might almost say one's friends.\nIn the matter of world news there was not too much, but just about\nenough. I subscribed. I have had no occasion to regret it. Every morning\nI get all the news I need for the day; sometimes from the headlines,\nsometimes from the text. I have never had to call for a dictionary yet.\nI read the paper with ease. Often I do not quite understand, often some\nof the details escape me, but no matter, I get the idea. I will cut out\na passage or two, then you see how limpid the language is:\n\nIl ritorno dei Beati d'Italia\n\nElargizione del Re all' Ospedale italiano\n\nThe first line means that the Italian sovereigns are coming back--they\nhave been to England. The second line seems to mean that they enlarged\nthe King at the Italian hospital. With a banquet, I suppose. An English\nbanquet has that effect. Further:\n\n_Il ritorno dei sovrani_\n\na Roma\n\nROMA, 24, ore 22,50.--_I Sovrani e le Principessine Reali si attendono a\nRoma domani alle ore_ 15,51.\n\nReturn of the sovereigns to Rome, you see. Date of the telegram, Rome,\nNovember 24, ten minutes before twenty-three o'clock. The telegram seems\nto say, “The Sovereigns and the Royal Children expect themselves at Rome\ntomorrow at fifty-one minutes after fifteen o'clock.”\n\nI do not know about Italian time, but I judge it begins at midnight\nand runs through the twenty-four hours without breaking bulk. In the\nfollowing ad, the theaters open at half-past twenty. If these are not\nmatinees, 20.30 must mean 8.30 P.M., by my reckoning.\n\nSpettacolli del di 25\n\nTEATRO DELLA PERGOLA--(Ore 20,30)--Opera. BOHEME. TEATRO\nALFIERI.--Compagnia drammatica Drago--(Ore 20,30)--LA LEGGE.\nALHAMBRA--(Ore 20,30)--Spettacolo variato. SALA EDISON--Grandioso\nspettacolo Cinematografico: QUO-VADIS?--Inaugurazione della\nChiesa Russa -- In coda al Direttissimo -- Vedute di Firenze con gran\nmovimeno -- America: Transporto tronchi giganteschi--I ladri in casa del\nDiavolo -- Scene comiche. CINEMATOGRAFO -- Via Brunelleschi n. 4.--Programma\nstraordinario, DON CHISCIOTTE -- Prezzi populari.\n\nThe whole of that is intelligible to me--and sane and rational,\ntoo--except the remark about the Inauguration of a Russian Cheese. That\none oversizes my hand. Gimme me five cards.\n\nThis is a four-page paper; and as it is set in long primer leaded\nand has a page of advertisements, there is no room for the crimes,\ndisasters, and general sweepings of the outside world--thanks be! Today\nI find only a single importation of the off-color sort:\n\nUna Principessa\n\nche fugge con un cocchiere\n\nPARIGI, 24.--Il MATIN ha da Berlino che la principessa\nSchovenbare-Waldenbure scomparve il 9 novembre. Sarebbe partita col suo\ncocchiere.\n\nLa Principassa ha 27 anni.\n\nTwenty-seven years old, and scomparve--scampered--on the 9th November.\nYou see by the added detail that she departed with her coachman. I hope\nSarebbe has not made a mistake, but I am afraid the chances are that she\nhas. _Sono dispiacentissimo_.\n\nThere are several fires: also a couple of accidents. This is one of\nthem:\n\nGrave disgrazia sul Ponte Vecchio\n\nStammattina, circe le 7,30, mentre Giuseppe Sciatti, di anni 55, di\nCasellina e Torri, passava dal Ponte Vecchio, stando seduto sopra un\nbarroccio carico di verdura, perse l' equilibrio e cadde al suolo,\nrimanendo con la gamba destra sotto una ruota del veicolo.\n\nLo Sciatti fu subito raccolto da alcuni cittadini, che, per mezzo della\npubblica vettura n. 365, lo transporto a San Giovanni di Dio.\n\nIvi il medico di guardia gli riscontro la frattura della gamba destra\ne alcune lievi escoriazioni giudicandolo guaribile in 50 giorni salvo\ncomplicazioni.\n\nWhat it seems to say is this: “Serious Disgrace on the Old Old Bridge.\nThis morning about 7.30, Mr. Joseph Sciatti, aged 55, of Casellina and\nTorri, while standing up in a sitting posture on top of a carico barrow\nof vedure (foliage? hay? vegetables?), lost his equilibrium and fell\non himself, arriving with his left leg under one of the wheels of the\nvehicle.\n\n“Said Sciatti was suddenly harvested (gathered in?) by several citizens,\nwho by means of public cab No. 365 transported him to St. John of God.”\n\nParagraph No. 3 is a little obscure, but I think it says that the medico\nset the broken left leg--right enough, since there was nothing the\nmatter with the other one--and that several are encouraged to hope that\nfifty days well fetch him around in quite giudicandolo-guaribile way, if\nno complications intervene.\n\nI am sure I hope so myself.\n\nThere is a great and peculiar charm about reading news-scraps in a\nlanguage which you are not acquainted with--the charm that always goes\nwith the mysterious and the uncertain. You can never be absolutely\nsure of the meaning of anything you read in such circumstances; you are\nchasing an alert and gamy riddle all the time, and the baffling turns\nand dodges of the prey make the life of the hunt. A dictionary would\nspoil it. Sometimes a single word of doubtful purport will cast a veil\nof dreamy and golden uncertainty over a whole paragraph of cold and\npractical certainties, and leave steeped in a haunting and adorable\nmystery an incident which had been vulgar and commonplace but for that\nbenefaction. Would you be wise to draw a dictionary on that gracious\nword? would you be properly grateful?\n\nAfter a couple of days' rest I now come back to my subject and seek\na case in point. I find it without trouble, in the morning paper; a\ncablegram from Chicago and Indiana by way of Paris. All the words save\none are guessable by a person ignorant of Italian:\n\nRevolverate in teatro\n\nPARIGI, 27.--La PATRIE ha da Chicago:\n\nIl guardiano del teatro dell'opera di Walace (Indiana), avendo voluto\nespellare uno spettatore che continuava a fumare malgrado il diviety,\nquesto spalleggiato dai suoi amici tir`o diversi colpi di rivoltella.\nIl guardiano ripose. Nacque una scarica generale. Grande panico tra gli\nspettatori. Nessun ferito.\n\n_Translation._--“Revolveration in Theater. _Paris, 27th. La Patrie_ has\nfrom Chicago: The cop of the theater of the opera of Wallace, Indiana,\nhad willed to expel a spectator which continued to smoke in spite of the\nprohibition, who, spalleggiato by his friends, tire (_Fr. Tire, Anglice\nPulled_) manifold revolver-shots; great panic among the spectators.\nNobody hurt.”\n\nIt is bettable that that harmless cataclysm in the theater of the opera\nof Wallace, Indiana, excited not a person in Europe but me, and so came\nnear to not being worth cabling to Florence by way of France. But it\ndoes excite me. It excites me because I cannot make out, for sure, what\nit was that moved the spectator to resist the officer. I was gliding\nalong smoothly and without obstruction or accident, until I came to that\nword “spalleggiato,” then the bottom fell out. You notice what a rich\ngloom, what a somber and pervading mystery, that word sheds all over the\nwhole Wallachian tragedy. That is the charm of the thing, that is the\ndelight of it. This is where you begin, this is where you revel. You can\nguess and guess, and have all the fun you like; you need not be afraid\nthere will be an end to it; none is possible, for no amount of guessing\nwill ever furnish you a meaning for that word that you can be sure is\nthe right one. All the other words give you hints, by their form, their\nsound, or their spelling--this one doesn't, this one throws out no\nhints, this one keeps its secret. If there is even the slightest slight\nshadow of a hint anywhere, it lies in the very meagerly suggestive fact\nthat “spalleggiato” carries our word “egg” in its stomach. Well, make\nthe most out of it, and then where are you at? You conjecture that\nthe spectator which was smoking in spite of the prohibition and become\nreprohibited by the guardians, was “egged on” by his friends, and that\nwas owing to that evil influence that he initiated the revolveration in\ntheater that has galloped under the sea and come crashing through the\nEuropean press without exciting anybody but me. But are you sure, are\nyou dead sure, that that was the way of it? No. Then the uncertainty\nremains, the mystery abides, and with it the charm. Guess again.\n\nIf I had a phrase-book of a really satisfactory sort I would study it,\nand not give all my free time to undictionarial readings, but there is\nno such work on the market. The existing phrase-books are inadequate.\nThey are well enough as far as they go, but when you fall down and skin\nyour leg they don't tell you what to say.\n\n\n\nITALIAN WITH GRAMMAR\n\nI found that a person of large intelligence could read this beautiful\nlanguage with considerable facility without a dictionary, but I\npresently found that to such a person a grammar could be of use at\ntimes. It is because, if he does not know the _were's_ and the\n_was's_ and the _maybe's_ and the _has-beens's_ apart, confusions and\nuncertainties can arise. He can get the idea that a thing is going to\nhappen next week when the truth is that it has already happened week\nbefore last. Even more previously, sometimes. Examination and inquiry\nshowed me that the adjectives and such things were frank and fair-minded\nand straightforward, and did not shuffle; it was the Verb that mixed the\nhands, it was the Verb that lacked stability, it was the Verb that had\nno permanent opinion about anything, it was the Verb that was always\ndodging the issue and putting out the light and making all the trouble.\n\nFurther examination, further inquiry, further reflection, confirmed this\njudgment, and established beyond peradventure the fact that the Verb was\nthe storm-center. This discovery made plain the right and wise course to\npursue in order to acquire certainty and exactness in understanding the\nstatements which the newspaper was daily endeavoring to convey to me: I\nmust catch a Verb and tame it. I must find out its ways, I must spot\nits eccentricities, I must penetrate its disguises, I must intelligently\nforesee and forecast at least the commoner of the dodges it was likely\nto try upon a stranger in given circumstances, I must get in on its main\nshifts and head them off, I must learn its game and play the limit.\n\nI had noticed, in other foreign languages, that verbs are bred in\nfamilies, and that the members of each family have certain features or\nresemblances that are common to that family and distinguish it from the\nother families--the other kin, the cousins and what not. I had noticed\nthat this family-mark is not usually the nose or the hair, so to speak,\nbut the tail--the Termination--and that these tails are quite definitely\ndifferentiated; insomuch that an expert can tell a Pluperfect from a\nSubjunctive by its tail as easily and as certainly as a cowboy can tell\na cow from a horse by the like process, the result of observation and\nculture. I should explain that I am speaking of legitimate verbs, those\nverbs which in the slang of the grammar are called Regular. There are\nothers--I am not meaning to conceal this; others called Irregulars, born\nout of wedlock, of unknown and uninteresting parentage, and naturally\ndestitute of family resemblances, as regards to all features, tails\nincluded. But of these pathetic outcasts I have nothing to say. I do not\napprove of them, I do not encourage them; I am prudishly delicate and\nsensitive, and I do not allow them to be used in my presence.\n\nBut, as I have said, I decided to catch one of the others and break it\ninto harness. One is enough. Once familiar with its assortment of tails,\nyou are immune; after that, no regular verb can conceal its specialty\nfrom you and make you think it is working the past or the future or the\nconditional or the unconditional when it is engaged in some other line\nof business--its tail will give it away. I found out all these things by\nmyself, without a teacher.\n\nI selected the verb _amare, to love._ Not for any personal reason, for\nI am indifferent about verbs; I care no more for one verb than for\nanother, and have little or no respect for any of them; but in foreign\nlanguages you always begin with that one. Why, I don't know. It is\nmerely habit, I suppose; the first teacher chose it, Adam was satisfied,\nand there hasn't been a successor since with originality enough to start\na fresh one. For they _are _a pretty limited lot, you will admit that?\nOriginality is not in their line; they can't think up anything new,\nanything to freshen up the old moss-grown dullness of the language\nlesson and put life and “go” into it, and charm and grace and\npicturesqueness.\n\nI knew I must look after those details myself; therefore I thought them\nout and wrote them down, and sent for the _facchino _and explained them\nto him, and said he must arrange a proper plant, and get together a\ngood stock company among the _contadini_, and design the costumes, and\ndistribute the parts; and drill the troupe, and be ready in three days\nto begin on this Verb in a shipshape and workman-like manner. I told him\nto put each grand division of it under a foreman, and each subdivision\nunder a subordinate of the rank of sergeant or corporal or something\nlike that, and to have a different uniform for each squad, so that I\ncould tell a Pluperfect from a Compound Future without looking at the\nbook; the whole battery to be under his own special and particular\ncommand, with the rank of Brigadier, and I to pay the freight.\n\nI then inquired into the character and possibilities of the selected\nverb, and was much disturbed to find that it was over my size, it being\nchambered for fifty-seven rounds--fifty-seven ways of saying I _love_\nwithout reloading; and yet none of them likely to convince a girl that\nwas laying for a title, or a title that was laying for rocks.\n\nIt seemed to me that with my inexperience it would be foolish to go into\naction with this mitrailleuse, so I ordered it to the rear and told the\nfacchino to provide something a little more primitive to start with,\nsomething less elaborate, some gentle old-fashioned flint-lock,\nsmooth-bore, double-barreled thing, calculated to cripple at two hundred\nyards and kill at forty--an arrangement suitable for a beginner who\ncould be satisfied with moderate results on the offstart and did not\nwish to take the whole territory in the first campaign.\n\nBut in vain. He was not able to mend the matter, all the verbs being\nof the same build, all Gatlings, all of the same caliber and delivery,\nfifty-seven to the volley, and fatal at a mile and a half. But he said\nthe auxiliary verb _avere, to have_, was a tidy thing, and easy to\nhandle in a seaway, and less likely to miss stays in going about than\nsome of the others; so, upon his recommendation I chose that one,\nand told him to take it along and scrape its bottom and break out its\nspinnaker and get it ready for business.\n\nI will explain that a facchino is a general-utility domestic. Mine was a\nhorse-doctor in his better days, and a very good one.\n\nAt the end of three days the facchino-doctor-brigadier was ready. I was\nalso ready, with a stenographer. We were in a room called the Rope-Walk.\nThis is a formidably long room, as is indicated by its facetious name,\nand is a good place for reviews. At 9:30 the F.-D.-B. took his place\nnear me and gave the word of command; the drums began to rumble and\nthunder, the head of the forces appeared at an upper door, and the\n“march-past” was on. Down they filed, a blaze of variegated color, each\nsquad gaudy in a uniform of its own and bearing a banner inscribed with\nits verbal rank and quality: first the Present Tense in Mediterranean\nblue and old gold, then the Past Definite in scarlet and black, then the\nImperfect in green and yellow, then the Indicative Future in the stars\nand stripes, then the Old Red Sandstone Subjunctive in purple\nand silver--and so on and so on, fifty-seven privates and twenty\ncommissioned and non-commissioned officers; certainly one of the most\nfiery and dazzling and eloquent sights I have ever beheld. I could not\nkeep back the tears. Presently:\n\n“Halt!” commanded the Brigadier.\n\n“Front--face!”\n\n“Right dress!”\n\n“Stand at ease!”\n\n“One--two--three. In unison--_recite!_”\n\nIt was fine. In one noble volume of sound of all the fifty-seven\nHaves in the Italian language burst forth in an exalting and splendid\nconfusion. Then came commands:\n\n“About--face! Eyes--front! Helm alee--hard aport! Forward--march!” and\nthe drums let go again.\n\nWhen the last Termination had disappeared, the commander said the\ninstruction drill would now begin, and asked for suggestions. I said:\n\n“They say _I have, thou hast, he has_, and so on, but they don't say\n_what_. It will be better, and more definite, if they have something to\nhave; just an object, you know, a something--anything will do; anything\nthat will give the listener a sort of personal as well as grammatical\ninterest in their joys and complaints, you see.”\n\nHe said:\n\n“It is a good point. Would a dog do?”\n\nI said I did not know, but we could try a dog and see. So he sent out an\naide-de-camp to give the order to add the dog.\n\nThe six privates of the Present Tense now filed in, in charge of\nSergeant Avere (_to have_), and displaying their banner. They formed in\nline of battle, and recited, one at a time, thus:\n\n“_Io ho un cane,_ I have a dog.”\n\n“_Tu hai un cane_, thou hast a dog.”\n\n_“Egli ha un cane, _he has a dog.”\n\n_“Noi abbiamo un cane_, we have a dog.”\n\n“_Voi avete un cane_, you have a dog.”\n\n“_Eglino hanno un cane,_ they have a dog.”\n\nNo comment followed. They returned to camp, and I reflected a while. The\ncommander said:\n\n“I fear you are disappointed.”\n\n“Yes,” I said; “they are too monotonous, too singsong, to\ndead-and-alive; they have no expression, no elocution. It isn't natural;\nit could never happen in real life. A person who had just acquired a dog\nis either blame' glad or blame' sorry. He is not on the fence. I never\nsaw a case. What the nation do you suppose is the matter with these\npeople?”\n\nHe thought maybe the trouble was with the dog. He said:\n\n“These are _contadini_, you know, and they have a prejudice against\ndogs--that is, against marimane. Marimana dogs stand guard over people's\nvines and olives, you know, and are very savage, and thereby a grief and\nan inconvenience to persons who want other people's things at night. In\nmy judgment they have taken this dog for a marimana, and have soured on\nhim.”\n\nI saw that the dog was a mistake, and not functionable: we must try\nsomething else; something, if possible, that could evoke sentiment,\ninterest, feeling.\n\n“What is cat, in Italian?” I asked.\n\n“Gatto.”\n\n“Is it a gentleman cat, or a lady?”\n\n“Gentleman cat.”\n\n“How are these people as regards that animal?”\n\n“We-ll, they--they--”\n\n“You hesitate: that is enough. How are they about chickens?”\n\nHe tilted his eyes toward heaven in mute ecstasy. I understood.\n\n“What is chicken, in Italian?” I asked.\n\n“Pollo, _Podere._” (Podere is Italian for master. It is a title of\ncourtesy, and conveys reverence and admiration.) “Pollo is one chicken\nby itself; when there are enough present to constitute a plural, it is\n_polli._”\n\n“Very well, polli will do. Which squad is detailed for duty next?”\n\n“The Past Definite.”\n\n“Send out and order it to the front--with chickens. And let them\nunderstand that we don't want any more of this cold indifference.”\n\nHe gave the order to an aide, adding, with a haunting tenderness in his\ntone and a watering mouth in his aspect:\n\n“Convey to them the conception that these are unprotected chickens.” He\nturned to me, saluting with his hand to his temple, and explained, “It\nwill inflame their interest in the poultry, sire.”\n\nA few minutes elapsed. Then the squad marched in and formed up, their\nfaces glowing with enthusiasm, and the file-leader shouted:\n\n“_Ebbi polli_, I had chickens!”\n\n“Good!” I said. “Go on, the next.”\n\n“_Avest polli_, thou hadst chickens!”\n\n“Fine! Next!”\n\n“_Ebbe polli_, he had chickens!”\n\n“Moltimoltissimo! Go on, the next!”\n\n“_Avemmo polli,_ we had chickens!”\n\n“Basta-basta aspettatto avanti--last man--_charge_!”\n\n“_Ebbero polli_, they had chickens!”\n\nThen they formed in echelon, by columns of fours, refused the left, and\nretired in great style on the double-quick. I was enchanted, and said:\n\n“Now, doctor, that is something _like_! Chickens are the ticket, there\nis no doubt about it. What is the next squad?”\n\n“The Imperfect.”\n\n“How does it go?”\n\n“_Io Aveva_, I had, _tu avevi_, thou hadst, _egli aveva_, he had, _noi\nav_--”\n\n“Wait--we've just _had _the hads. What are you giving me?”\n\n“But this is another breed.”\n\n“What do we want of another breed? Isn't one breed enough? _Had_ is\n_had_, and your tricking it out in a fresh way of spelling isn't going\nto make it any hadder than it was before; now you know that yourself.”\n\n“But there is a distinction--they are not just the same Hads.”\n\n“How do you make it out?”\n\n“Well, you use that first Had when you are referring to something that\nhappened at a named and sharp and perfectly definite moment; you use the\nother when the thing happened at a vaguely defined time and in a more\nprolonged and indefinitely continuous way.”\n\n“Why, doctor, it is pure nonsense; you know it yourself. Look here: If\nI have had a had, or have wanted to have had a had, or was in a position\nright then and there to have had a had that hadn't had any chance to go\nout hadding on account of this foolish discrimination which lets one Had\ngo hadding in any kind of indefinite grammatical weather but restricts\nthe other one to definite and datable meteoric convulsions, and keeps it\npining around and watching the barometer all the time, and liable to\nget sick through confinement and lack of exercise, and all that sort of\nthing, why--why, the inhumanity of it is enough, let alone the\nwanton superfluity and uselessness of any such a loafing consumptive\nhospital-bird of a Had taking up room and cumbering the place for\nnothing. These finical refinements revolt me; it is not right, it is not\nhonorable; it is constructive nepotism to keep in office a Had that is\nso delicate it can't come out when the wind's in the nor'west--I won't\nhave this dude on the payroll. Cancel his exequator; and look here--”\n\n“But you miss the point. It is like this. You see--”\n\n“Never mind explaining, I don't care anything about it. Six Hads is\nenough for me; anybody that needs twelve, let him subscribe; I don't\nwant any stock in a Had Trust. Knock out the Prolonged and Indefinitely\nContinuous; four-fifths of it is water, anyway.”\n\n“But I beg you, podere! It is often quite indispensable in cases\nwhere--”\n\n“Pipe the next squad to the assault!”\n\nBut it was not to be; for at that moment the dull boom of the noon\ngun floated up out of far-off Florence, followed by the usual softened\njangle of church-bells, Florentine and suburban, that bursts out in\nmurmurous response; by labor-union law the _colazione_ (1) must stop;\nstop promptly, stop instantly, stop definitely, like the chosen and best\nof the breed of Hads.\n\n1. Colazione is Italian for a collection, a meeting, a seance, a\nsitting.--M.T.\n\n\n\nA BURLESQUE BIOGRAPHY\n\nTwo or three persons having at different times intimated that if I would\nwrite an autobiography they would read it when they got leisure, I yield\nat last to this frenzied public demand and herewith tender my history.\n\nOurs is a noble house, and stretches a long way back into antiquity.\nThe earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the\nfamily by the name of Higgins. This was in the eleventh century, when\nour people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England. Why it is\nthat our long line has ever since borne the maternal name (except when\none of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert\nfoolishness), instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever\nfelt much desire to stir. It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we\nleave it alone. All the old families do that way.\n\nArthour Twain was a man of considerable note--a solicitor on the highway\nin William Rufus's time. At about the age of thirty he went to one of\nthose fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see about\nsomething, and never returned again. While there he died suddenly.\n\nAugustus Twain seems to have made something of a stir about the year\n1160. He was as full of fun as he could be, and used to take his old\nsaber and sharpen it up, and get in a convenient place on a dark night,\nand stick it through people as they went by, to see them jump. He was a\nborn humorist. But he got to going too far with it; and the first time\nhe was found stripping one of these parties, the authorities removed one\nend of him, and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar, where it\ncould contemplate the people and have a good time. He never liked any\nsituation so much or stuck to it so long.\n\nThen for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession\nof soldiers--noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went into battle\nsinging, right behind the army, and always went out a-whooping, right\nahead of it.\n\nThis is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart's poor witticism that\nour family tree never had but one limb to it, and that that one stuck\nout at right angles, and bore fruit winter and summer.\n\nEarly in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain, called “the Scholar.”\n He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand. And he could imitate anybody's\nhand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off\nto see it. He had infinite sport with his talent. But by and by he took\na contract to break stone for a road, and the roughness of the work\nspoiled his hand. Still, he enjoyed life all the time he was in the\nstone business, which, with inconsiderable intervals, was some forty-two\nyears. In fact, he died in harness. During all those long years he gave\nsuch satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week\ntill the government gave him another. He was a perfect pet. And he was\nalways a favorite with his fellow-artists, and was a conspicuous member\nof their benevolent secret society, called the Chain Gang. He always\nwore his hair short, had a preference for striped clothes, and died\nlamented by the government. He was a sore loss to his country. For he\nwas so regular.\n\nSome years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain. He came over\nto this country with Columbus in 1492 as a passenger. He appears to have\nbeen of a crusty, uncomfortable disposition. He complained of the food\nall the way over, and was always threatening to go ashore unless there\nwas a change. He wanted fresh shad. Hardly a day passed over his head\nthat he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air,\nsneering about the commander, and saying he did not believe Columbus\nknew where he was going to or had ever been there before. The memorable\ncry of “Land ho!” thrilled every heart in the ship but his. He gazed\nawhile through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the\ndistant water, and then said: “Land be hanged--it's a raft!”\n\nWhen this questionable passenger came on board the ship, he brought\nnothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked\n“B. G.,” one cotton sock marked “L. W. C.,” one woolen one marked “D.\nF.,” and a night-shirt marked “O. M. R.” And yet during the voyage he\nworried more about his “trunk,” and gave himself more airs about it,\nthan all the rest of the passengers put together. If the ship was “down\nby the head,” and would not steer, he would go and move his “trunk”\n further aft, and then watch the effect. If the ship was “by the stern,”\n he would suggest to Columbus to detail some men to “shift that baggage.”\n In storms he had to be gagged, because his wailings about his “trunk”\n made it impossible for the men to hear the orders. The man does not\nappear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing,\nbut it is noted in the ship's log as a “curious circumstance” that\nalbeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper, he took\nit ashore in four trunks, a queensware crate, and a couple of champagne\nbaskets. But when he came back insinuating, in an insolent, swaggering\nway, that some of this things were missing, and was going to search\nthe other passengers' baggage, it was too much, and they threw him\noverboard. They watched long and wonderingly for him to come up, but not\neven a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide. But while every one was\nmost absorbed in gazing over the side, and the interest was momentarily\nincreasing, it was observed with consternation that the vessel was\nadrift and the anchor-cable hanging limp from the bow. Then in the\nship's dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note:\n\n“In time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde gone downe\nand got ye anchor, and toke ye same and solde it to ye dam sauvages from\nye interior, saying yt he hadde founde it, ye sonne of a ghun!”\n\nYet this ancestor had good and noble instincts, and it is with pride\nthat we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who\never interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our\nIndians. He built a commodious jail and put up a gallows, and to\nhis dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more\nrestraining and elevating influence on the Indians than any other\nreformer that ever labored among them. At this point the chronicle\nbecomes less frank and chatty, and closes abruptly by saying that the\nold voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever\nhanged in America, and while there received injuries which terminated in\nhis death.\n\nThe great-grandson of the “Reformer” flourished in sixteen hundred and\nsomething, and was known in our annals as “the old Admiral,” though in\nhistory he had other titles. He was long in command of fleets of swift\nvessels, well armed and manned, and did great service in hurrying up\nmerchantmen. Vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on, always\nmade good fair time across the ocean. But if a ship still loitered\nin spite of all he could do, his indignation would grow till he could\ncontain himself no longer--and then he would take that ship home where\nhe lived and keep it there carefully, expecting the owners to come for\nit, but they never did. And he would try to get the idleness and sloth\nout of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take invigorating\nexercise and a bath. He called it “walking a plank.” All the pupils\nliked it. At any rate, they never found any fault with it after trying\nit. When the owners were late coming for their ships, the Admiral always\nburned them, so that the insurance money should not be lost. At last\nthis fine old tar was cut down in the fullness of his years and honors.\nAnd to her dying day, his poor heart-broken widow believed that if\nhe had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been\nresuscitated.\n\nCharles Henry Twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth\ncentury, and was a zealous and distinguished missionary. He converted\nsixteen thousand South Sea islanders, and taught them that a dog-tooth\nnecklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to\ndivine service in. His poor flock loved him very, very dearly; and\nwhen his funeral was over, they got up in a body (and came out of the\nrestaurant) with tears in their eyes, and saying, one to another, that\nhe was a good tender missionary, and they wished they had some more of\nhim.\n\nPah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis (Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye-Twain)\nadorned the middle of the eighteenth century, and aided General Braddock\nwith all his heart to resist the oppressor Washington. It was this\nancestor who fired seventeen times at our Washington from behind a tree.\nSo far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral story-books is\ncorrect; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth\nround the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being\nreserved by the Great Spirit for some mighty mission, and he dared not\nlift his sacrilegious rifle against him again, the narrative seriously\nimpairs the integrity of history. What he did say was:\n\n“It ain't no (hic) no use. 'At man's so drunk he can't stan' still long\nenough for a man to hit him. I (hic) I can't 'ford to fool away any more\nam'nition on him.”\n\nThat was why he stopped at the seventeenth round, and it was a good,\nplain, matter-of-fact reason, too, and one that easily commends itself\nto us by the eloquent, persuasive flavor of probability there is about\nit.\n\nI also enjoyed the story-book narrative, but I felt a marring misgiving\nthat every Indian at Braddock's Defeat who fired at a soldier a couple\nof times (two easily grows to seventeen in a century), and missed\nhim, jumped to the conclusion that the Great Spirit was reserving that\nsoldier for some grand mission; and so I somehow feared that the only\nreason why Washington's case is remembered and the others forgotten is,\nthat in his the prophecy came true, and in that of the others it\ndidn't. There are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the\nprophecies Indians and other unauthorized parties have made; but one may\ncarry in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have\nbeen fulfilled.\n\nI will remark here, in passing, that certain ancestors of mine are so\nthoroughly well-known in history by their aliases, that I have not felt\nit to be worth while to dwell upon them, or even mention them in the\norder of their birth. Among these may be mentioned Richard Brinsley\nTwain, alias Guy Fawkes; John Wentworth Twain, alias Sixteen-String\nJack; William Hogarth Twain, alias Jack Sheppard; Ananias Twain, alias\nBaron Munchausen; John George Twain, alias Captain Kydd; and then there\nare George Francis Twain, Tom Pepper, Nebuchadnezzar, and Baalam's\nAss--they all belong to our family, but to a branch of it somewhat\ndistinctly removed from the honorable direct line--in fact, a collateral\nbranch, whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that, in\norder to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for,\nthey have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged.\n\nIt is not well, when writing an autobiography, to follow your ancestry\ndown too close to your own time--it is safest to speak only vaguely of\nyour great-grandfather, and then skip from there to yourself, which I\nnow do.\n\nI was born without teeth--and there Richard III. had the advantage of\nme; but I was born without a humpback, likewise, and there I had the\nadvantage of him. My parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously\nhonest.\n\nBut now a thought occurs to me. My own history would really seem so tame\ncontrasted with that of my ancestors, that it is simply wisdom to leave\nit unwritten until I am hanged. If some other biographies I have read\nhad stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred, it would have\nbeen a felicitous thing for the reading public. How does it strike you?\n\n\n\nHOW TO TELL A STORY\n\nThe Humorous Story an American Development.--Its Difference from Comic\nand Witty Stories\n\nI do not claim that I can tell a story as it ought to be told. I only\nclaim to know how a story ought to be told, for I have been almost daily\nin the company of the most expert story-tellers for many years.\n\nThere are several kinds of stories, but only one difficult kind--the\nhumorous. I will talk mainly about that one. The humorous story is\nAmerican, the comic story is English, the witty story is French. The\nhumorous story depends for its effect upon the _manner _of the telling;\nthe comic story and the witty story upon the _matter_.\n\nThe humorous story may be spun out to great length, and may wander\naround as much as it pleases, and arrive nowhere in particular; but the\ncomic and witty stories must be brief and end with a point. The humorous\nstory bubbles gently along, the others burst.\n\nThe humorous story is strictly a work of art--high and delicate art--and\nonly an artist can tell it; but no art is necessary in telling the comic\nand the witty story; anybody can do it. The art of telling a humorous\nstory--understand, I mean by word of mouth, not print--was created in\nAmerica, and has remained at home.\n\nThe humorous story is told gravely; the teller does his best to conceal\nthe fact that he even dimly suspects that there is anything funny about\nit; but the teller of the comic story tells you beforehand that it is\none of the funniest things he has ever heard, then tells it with eager\ndelight, and is the first person to laugh when he gets through. And\nsometimes, if he has had good success, he is so glad and happy that\nhe will repeat the “nub” of it and glance around from face to face,\ncollecting applause, and then repeat it again. It is a pathetic thing to\nsee.\n\nVery often, of course, the rambling and disjointed humorous story\nfinishes with a nub, point, snapper, or whatever you like to call it.\nThen the listener must be alert, for in many cases the teller will\ndivert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and\nindifferent way, with the pretense that he does not know it is a nub.\n\nArtemus Ward used that trick a good deal; then when the belated audience\npresently caught the joke he would look up with innocent surprise, as if\nwondering what they had found to laugh at. Dan Setchell used it before\nhim, Nye and Riley and others use it today.\n\nBut the teller of the comic story does not slur the nub; he shouts it at\nyou--every time. And when he prints it, in England, France, Germany, and\nItaly, he italicizes it, puts some whopping exclamation-points after\nit, and sometimes explains it in a parenthesis. All of which is very\ndepressing, and makes one want to renounce joking and lead a better\nlife.\n\nLet me set down an instance of the comic method, using an anecdote which\nhas been popular all over the world for twelve or fifteen hundred years.\nThe teller tells it in this way:\n\nTHE WOUNDED SOLDIER\n\nIn the course of a certain battle a soldier whose leg had been shot\noff appealed to another soldier who was hurrying by to carry him to the\nrear, informing him at the same time of the loss which he had sustained;\nwhereupon the generous son of Mars, shouldering the unfortunate,\nproceeded to carry out his desire. The bullets and cannon-balls were\nflying in all directions, and presently one of the latter took the\nwounded man's head off--without, however, his deliverer being aware of\nit. In no long time he was hailed by an officer, who said:\n\n“Where are you going with that carcass?”\n\n“To the rear, sir--he's lost his leg!”\n\n“His leg, forsooth?” responded the astonished officer; “you mean his\nhead, you booby.”\n\nWhereupon the soldier dispossessed himself of his burden, and stood\nlooking down upon it in great perplexity. At length he said:\n\n“It is true, sir, just as you have said.” Then after a pause he added,\n“_But he TOLD me IT WAS HIS LEG!!!!!_”\n\nHere the narrator bursts into explosion after explosion of thunderous\nhorse-laughter, repeating that nub from time to time through his gasping\nand shriekings and suffocatings.\n\nIt takes only a minute and a half to tell that in its comic-story form;\nand isn't worth the telling, after all. Put into the humorous-story\nform it takes ten minutes, and is about the funniest thing I have ever\nlistened to--as James Whitcomb Riley tells it.\n\nHe tells it in the character of a dull-witted old farmer who has just\nheard it for the first time, thinks it is unspeakably funny, and is\ntrying to repeat it to a neighbor. But he can't remember it; so he gets\nall mixed up and wanders helplessly round and round, putting in tedious\ndetails that don't belong in the tale and only retard it; taking them\nout conscientiously and putting in others that are just as useless;\nmaking minor mistakes now and then and stopping to correct them and\nexplain how he came to make them; remembering things which he forgot\nto put in in their proper place and going back to put them in there;\nstopping his narrative a good while in order to try to recall the name\nof the soldier that was hurt, and finally remembering that the soldier's\nname was not mentioned, and remarking placidly that the name is of no\nreal importance, anyway--better, of course, if one knew it, but not\nessential, after all--and so on, and so on, and so on.\n\nThe teller is innocent and happy and pleased with himself, and has\nto stop every little while to hold himself in and keep from laughing\noutright; and does hold in, but his body quakes in a jelly-like way with\ninterior chuckles; and at the end of the ten minutes the audience have\nlaughed until they are exhausted, and the tears are running down their\nfaces.\n\nThe simplicity and innocence and sincerity and unconsciousness of the\nold farmer are perfectly simulated, and the result is a performance\nwhich is thoroughly charming and delicious. This is art--and fine and\nbeautiful, and only a master can compass it; but a machine could tell\nthe other story.\n\nTo string incongruities and absurdities together in a wandering and\nsometimes purposeless way, and seem innocently unaware that they\nare absurdities, is the basis of the American art, if my position is\ncorrect. Another feature is the slurring of the point. A third is the\ndropping of a studied remark apparently without knowing it, as if one\nwhere thinking aloud. The fourth and last is the pause.\n\nArtemus Ward dealt in numbers three and four a good deal. He would begin\nto tell with great animation something which he seemed to think was\nwonderful; then lose confidence, and after an apparently absent-minded\npause add an incongruous remark in a soliloquizing way; and that was the\nremark intended to explode the mine--and it did.\n\nFor instance, he would say eagerly, excitedly, “I once knew a man in New\nZealand who hadn't a tooth in his head”--here his animation would\ndie out; a silent, reflective pause would follow, then he would say\ndreamily, and as if to himself, “and yet that man could beat a drum\nbetter than any man I ever saw.”\n\nThe pause is an exceedingly important feature in any kind of story, and\na frequently recurring feature, too. It is a dainty thing, and delicate,\nand also uncertain and treacherous; for it must be exactly the right\nlength--no more and no less--or it fails of its purpose and makes\ntrouble. If the pause is too short the impressive point is passed, and\nthe audience have had time to divine that a surprise is intended--and\nthen you can't surprise them, of course.\n\nOn the platform I used to tell a negro ghost story that had a pause in\nfront of the snapper on the end, and that pause was the most important\nthing in the whole story. If I got it the right length precisely, I\ncould spring the finishing ejaculation with effect enough to make some\nimpressible girl deliver a startled little yelp and jump out of her\nseat--and that was what I was after. This story was called “The\nGolden Arm,” and was told in this fashion. You can practice with it\nyourself--and mind you look out for the pause and get it right.\n\n\nTHE GOLDEN ARM\n\nOnce 'pon a time dey wuz a monsus mean man, en he live 'way out in de\nprairie all 'lone by hisself, 'cep'n he had a wife. En bimeby she died,\nen he tuck en toted her way out dah in de prairie en buried her. Well,\nshe had a golden arm--all solid gold, fum de shoulder down. He wuz\npow'ful mean--pow'ful; en dat night he couldn't sleep, caze he want dat\ngolden arm so bad.\n\nWhen it come midnight he couldn't stan' it no mo'; so he git up, he did,\nen tuck his lantern en shoved out thoo de storm en dug her up en got de\ngolden arm; en he bent his head down 'gin de win', en plowed en plowed\nen plowed thoo de snow. Den all on a sudden he stop (make a considerable\npause here, and look startled, and take a listening attitude) en say:\n“My _lan'_, what's dat?”\n\nEn he listen--en listen--en de win' say (set your teeth together and\nimitate the wailing and wheezing singsong of the wind), “Bzzz-z-zzz”--en\nden, way back yonder whah de grave is, he hear a _voice_!--he hear\na voice all mix' up in de win'--can't hardly tell 'em 'part--\n“Bzzz--zzz--W-h-o--g-o-t--m-y--g-o-l-d-e-n _arm?_” (You must begin to\nshiver violently now.)\n\nEn he begin to shiver en shake, en say, “Oh, my! _Oh_, my lan'!” en de\nwin' blow de lantern out, en de snow en sleet blow in his face en mos'\nchoke him, en he start a-plowin' knee-deep toward home mos' dead, he so\nsk'yerd--en pooty soon he hear de voice agin, en (pause) it 'us comin\n_after _him! “Bzzz--zzz--zzz W-h-o--g-o-t--m-y--g-o-l-d-e-n--_arm_?”\n\nWhen he git to de pasture he hear it agin--closter now, en\n_a-comin'!_--a-comin' back dah in de dark en de storm--(repeat the wind\nand the voice).

(Pause.)\n\nDen de voice say, _right at his year_--“W-h-o--g-o-t--m-y g-o-l-d-e-n\n_arm?_” (You must wail it out very plaintively and accusingly; then\nyou stare steadily and impressively into the face of the farthest-gone\nauditor--a girl, preferably--and let that awe-inspiring pause begin to\nbuild itself in the deep hush. When it has reached exactly the right\nlength, jump suddenly at that girl and yell, “_You've_ got it!”)\n\nIf you've got the _pause _right, she'll fetch a dear little yelp and\nspring right out of her shoes. But you _must _get the pause right; and\nyou will find it the most troublesome and aggravating and uncertain\nthing you ever undertook.\n\n\n\nGENERAL WASHINGTON'S NEGRO BODY-SERVANT\n\nA Biographical Sketch\n\nThe stirring part of this celebrated colored man's life properly began\nwith his death--that is to say, the notable features of his biography\nbegan with the first time he died. He had been little heard of up to\nthat time, but since then we have never ceased to hear of him; we have\nnever ceased to hear of him at stated, unfailing intervals. His was a\nmost remarkable career, and I have thought that its history would make\na valuable addition to our biographical literature. Therefore, I\nhave carefully collated the materials for such a work, from authentic\nsources, and here present them to the public. I have rigidly excluded\nfrom these pages everything of a doubtful character, with the object in\nview of introducing my work into the schools for the instruction of the\nyouth of my country.\n\nThe name of the famous body-servant of General Washington was George.\nAfter serving his illustrious master faithfully for half a century, and\nenjoying throughout this long term his high regard and confidence, it\nbecame his sorrowful duty at last to lay that beloved master to rest in\nhis peaceful grave by the Potomac. Ten years afterward--in 1809--full\nof years and honors, he died himself, mourned by all who knew him. The\n_Boston Gazette_ of that date thus refers to the event:\n\nGeorge, the favorite body-servant of the lamented Washington, died in\nRichmond, Va., last Tuesday, at the ripe age of 95 years. His intellect\nwas unimpaired, and his memory tenacious, up to within a few minutes of\nhis decease. He was present at the second installation of Washington as\nPresident, and also at his funeral, and distinctly remembered all the\nprominent incidents connected with those noted events.\n\nFrom this period we hear no more of the favorite body-servant of General\nWashington until May, 1825, at which time he died again. A Philadelphia\npaper thus speaks of the sad occurrence:\n\nAt Macon, Ga., last week, a colored man named George, who was the\nfavorite body-servant of General Washington, died at the advanced age\nof 95 years. Up to within a few hours of his dissolution he was in full\npossession of all his faculties, and could distinctly recollect the\nsecond installation of Washington, his death and burial, the surrender\nof Cornwallis, the battle of Trenton, the griefs and hardships of Valley\nForge, etc. Deceased was followed to the grave by the entire population\nof Macon.\n\nOn the Fourth of July, 1830, and also of 1834 and 1836, the subject of\nthis sketch was exhibited in great state upon the rostrum of the\norator of the day, and in November of 1840 he died again. The St. Louis\n_Republican_ of the 25th of that month spoke as follows:\n\n“ANOTHER RELIC OF THE REVOLUTION GONE.”\n\n“George, once the favorite body-servant of General Washington, died\nyesterday at the house of Mr. John Leavenworth in this city, at\nthe venerable age of 95 years. He was in the full possession of his\nfaculties up to the hour of his death, and distinctly recollected the\nfirst and second installations and death of President Washington,\nthe surrender of Cornwallis, the battles of Trenton and Monmouth, the\nsufferings of the patriot army at Valley Forge, the proclamation of the\nDeclaration of Independence, the speech of Patrick Henry in the Virginia\nHouse of Delegates, and many other old-time reminiscences of stirring\ninterest. Few white men die lamented as was this aged negro. The funeral\nwas very largely attended.”\n\nDuring the next ten or eleven years the subject of this sketch appeared\nat intervals at Fourth-of-July celebrations in various parts of the\ncountry, and was exhibited upon the rostrum with flattering success. But\nin the fall of 1855 he died again. The California papers thus speak of\nthe event:\n\nANOTHER OLD HERO GONE\n\nDied, at Dutch Flat, on the 7th of March, George (once the confidential\nbody-servant of General Washington), at the great age of 95 years. His\nmemory, which did not fail him till the last, was a wonderful storehouse\nof interesting reminiscences. He could distinctly recollect the\nfirst and second installations and death of President Washington, the\nsurrender of Cornwallis, the battles of Trenton and Monmouth, and\nBunker Hill, the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence, and\nBraddock's defeat. George was greatly respected in Dutch Flat, and it is\nestimated that there were 10,000 people present at his funeral.\n\nThe last time the subject of this sketch died was in June, 1864;\nand until we learn the contrary, it is just to presume that he died\npermanently this time. The Michigan papers thus refer to the sorrowful\nevent:\n\nANOTHER CHERISHED REMNANT OF THE REVOLUTION GONE\n\nGeorge, a colored man, and once the favorite body-servant of George\nWashington, died in Detroit last week, at the patriarchal age of 95\nyears. To the moment of his death his intellect was unclouded, and he\ncould distinctly remember the first and second installations and death\nof Washington, the surrender of Cornwallis, the battles of Trenton\nand Monmouth, and Bunker Hill, the proclamation of the Declaration of\nIndependence, Braddock's defeat, the throwing over of the tea in Boston\nharbor, and the landing of the Pilgrims. He died greatly respected, and\nwas followed to the grave by a vast concourse of people.\n\nThe faithful old servant is gone! We shall never see him more until\nhe turns up again. He has closed his long and splendid career of\ndissolution, for the present, and sleeps peacefully, as only they sleep\nwho have earned their rest. He was in all respects a remarkable man. He\nheld his age better than any celebrity that has figured in history; and\nthe longer he lived the stronger and longer his memory grew. If he lives\nto die again, he will distinctly recollect the discovery of America.\n\nThe above resume of his biography I believe to be substantially correct,\nalthough it is possible that he may have died once or twice in obscure\nplaces where the event failed of newspaper notoriety. One fault I find\nin all the notices of his death I have quoted, and this ought to be\ncorrected. In them he uniformly and impartially died at the age of 95.\nThis could not have been. He might have done that once, or maybe twice,\nbut he could not have continued it indefinitely. Allowing that when he\nfirst died, he died at the age of 95, he was 151 years old when he died\nlast, in 1864. But his age did not keep pace with his recollections.\nWhen he died the last time, he distinctly remembered the landing of the\nPilgrims, which took place in 1620. He must have been about twenty years\nold when he witnessed that event, wherefore it is safe to assert that\nthe body-servant of General Washington was in the neighborhood of\ntwo hundred and sixty or seventy years old when he departed this life\nfinally.\n\nHaving waited a proper length of time, to see if the subject of his\nsketch had gone from us reliably and irrevocably, I now publish his\nbiography with confidence, and respectfully offer it to a mourning\nnation.\n\nP.S.--I see by the papers that this infamous old fraud has just died\nagain, in Arkansas. This makes six times that he is known to have died,\nand always in a new place. The death of Washington's body-servant has\nceased to be a novelty; it's charm is gone; the people are tired of\nit; let it cease. This well-meaning but misguided negro has now put six\ndifferent communities to the expense of burying him in state, and has\nswindled tens of thousands of people into following him to the grave\nunder the delusion that a select and peculiar distinction was being\nconferred upon them. Let him stay buried for good now; and let that\nnewspaper suffer the severest censure that shall ever, in all the future\ntime, publish to the world that General Washington's favorite colored\nbody-servant has died again.\n\n\n\nWIT INSPIRATIONS OF THE “TWO-YEAR-OLDS”\n\nAll infants appear to have an impertinent and disagreeable fashion\nnowadays of saying “smart” things on most occasions that offer, and\nespecially on occasions when they ought not to be saying anything at\nall. Judging by the average published specimens of smart sayings, the\nrising generation of children are little better than idiots. And the\nparents must surely be but little better than the children, for in most\ncases they are the publishers of the sunbursts of infantile imbecility\nwhich dazzle us from the pages of our periodicals. I may seem to speak\nwith some heat, not to say a suspicion of personal spite; and I do admit\nthat it nettles me to hear about so many gifted infants in these days,\nand remember that I seldom said anything smart when I was a child. I\ntried it once or twice, but it was not popular. The family were not\nexpecting brilliant remarks from me, and so they snubbed me sometimes\nand spanked me the rest. But it makes my flesh creep and my blood run\ncold to think what might have happened to me if I had dared to utter\nsome of the smart things of this generation's “four-year-olds” where my\nfather could hear me. To have simply skinned me alive and considered his\nduty at an end would have seemed to him criminal leniency toward one\nso sinning. He was a stern, unsmiling man, and hated all forms of\nprecocity. If I had said some of the things I have referred to, and said\nthem in his hearing, he would have destroyed me. He would, indeed. He\nwould, provided the opportunity remained with him. But it would not, for\nI would have had judgment enough to take some strychnine first and say\nmy smart thing afterward. The fair record of my life has been tarnished\nby just one pun. My father overheard that, and he hunted me over four\nor five townships seeking to take my life. If I had been full-grown, of\ncourse he would have been right; but, child as I was, I could not know\nhow wicked a thing I had done.\n\nI made one of those remarks ordinarily called “smart things” before\nthat, but it was not a pun. Still, it came near causing a serious\nrupture between my father and myself. My father and mother, my uncle\nEphraim and his wife, and one or two others were present, and the\nconversation turned on a name for me. I was lying there trying some\nIndia-rubber rings of various patterns, and endeavoring to make a\nselection, for I was tired of trying to cut my teeth on people's\nfingers, and wanted to get hold of something that would enable me to\nhurry the thing through and get something else. Did you ever notice\nwhat a nuisance it was cutting your teeth on your nurse's finger, or how\nback-breaking and tiresome it was trying to cut them on your big toe?\nAnd did you never get out of patience and wish your teeth were in Jerico\nlong before you got them half cut? To me it seems as if these things\nhappened yesterday. And they did, to some children. But I digress. I\nwas lying there trying the India-rubber rings. I remember looking at the\nclock and noticing that in an hour and twenty-five minutes I would be\ntwo weeks old, and thinking how little I had done to merit the blessings\nthat were so unsparingly lavished upon me. My father said:\n\n“Abraham is a good name. My grandfather was named Abraham.”\n\nMy mother said:\n\n“Abraham is a good name. Very well. Let us have Abraham for one of his\nnames.”\n\nI said:\n\n“Abraham suits the subscriber.”\n\nMy father frowned, my mother looked pleased; my aunt said:\n\n“What a little darling it is!”\n\nMy father said:\n\n“Isaac is a good name, and Jacob is a good name.”\n\nMy mother assented, and said:\n\n“No names are better. Let us add Isaac and Jacob to his names.”\n\nI said:\n\n“All right. Isaac and Jacob are good enough for yours truly. Pass me\nthat rattle, if you please. I can't chew India-rubber rings all day.”\n\nNot a soul made a memorandum of these sayings of mine, for publication.\nI saw that, and did it myself, else they would have been utterly lost.\nSo far from meeting with a generous encouragement like other children\nwhen developing intellectually, I was now furiously scowled upon by my\nfather; my mother looked grieved and anxious, and even my aunt had about\nher an expression of seeming to think that maybe I had gone too far. I\ntook a vicious bite out of an India-rubber ring, and covertly broke the\nrattle over the kitten's head, but said nothing. Presently my father\nsaid:\n\n“Samuel is a very excellent name.”\n\nI saw that trouble was coming. Nothing could prevent it. I laid down my\nrattle; over the side of the cradle I dropped my uncle's silver watch,\nthe clothes-brush, the toy dog, my tin soldier, the nutmeg-grater, and\nother matters which I was accustomed to examine, and meditate upon and\nmake pleasant noises with, and bang and batter and break when I needed\nwholesome entertainment. Then I put on my little frock and my little\nbonnet, and took my pygmy shoes in one hand and my licorice in the\nother, and climbed out on the floor. I said to myself, Now, if the worse\ncomes to worst, I am ready. Then I said aloud, in a firm voice:\n\n“Father, I cannot, cannot wear the name of Samuel.”\n\n“My son!”\n\n“Father, I mean it. I cannot.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Father, I have an invincible antipathy to that name.”\n\n“My son, this is unreasonable. Many great and good men have been named\nSamuel.”\n\n“Sir, I have yet to hear of the first instance.”\n\n“What! There was Samuel the prophet. Was not he great and good?”\n\n“Not so very.”\n\n“My son! With His own voice the Lord called him.”\n\n“Yes, sir, and had to call him a couple times before he could come!”\n\nAnd then I sallied forth, and that stern old man sallied forth after\nme. He overtook me at noon the following day, and when the interview\nwas over I had acquired the name of Samuel, and a thrashing, and other\nuseful information; and by means of this compromise my father's wrath\nwas appeased and a misunderstanding bridged over which might have become\na permanent rupture if I had chosen to be unreasonable. But just judging\nby this episode, what would my father have done to me if I had\never uttered in his hearing one of the flat, sickly things these\n“two-years-olds” say in print nowadays? In my opinion there would have\nbeen a case of infanticide in our family.\n\n\n\nAN ENTERTAINING ARTICLE\n\nI take the following paragraph from an article in the Boston\n_Advertiser_:\n\nAN ENGLISH CRITIC ON MARK TWAIN\n\nPerhaps the most successful flights of humor of Mark Twain have been\ndescriptions of the persons who did not appreciate his humor at all. We\nhave become familiar with the Californians who were thrilled with terror\nby his burlesque of a newspaper reporter's way of telling a story,\nand we have heard of the Pennsylvania clergyman who sadly returned his\n_Innocents Abroad_ to the book-agent with the remark that “the man who\ncould shed tears over the tomb of Adam must be an idiot.” But Mark Twain\nmay now add a much more glorious instance to his string of trophies.\nThe _Saturday Review,_ in its number of October 8th, reviews his book\nof travels, which has been republished in England, and reviews it\nseriously. We can imagine the delight of the humorist in reading this\ntribute to his power; and indeed it is so amusing in itself that he can\nhardly do better than reproduce the article in full in his next monthly\nMemoranda.\n\n(Publishing the above paragraph thus, gives me a sort of authority for\nreproducing the _Saturday Review's_ article in full in these pages. I\ndearly wanted to do it, for I cannot write anything half so delicious\nmyself. If I had a cast-iron dog that could read this English criticism\nand preserve his austerity, I would drive him off the door-step.)\n\n(From the London “Saturday Review.”)\n\nREVIEWS OF NEW BOOKS\n\n_The Innocents Abroad_.

We never felt this so deeply as when we\nfinished the last chapter of the above-named extravagant work. Macaulay\ndied too soon--for none but he could mete out complete and comprehensive\njustice to the insolence, the impertinence, the presumption, the\nmendacity, and, above all, the majestic ignorance of this author.\n\nTo say that _The Innocents Abroad_ is a curious book, would be to use\nthe faintest language--would be to speak of the Matterhorn as a neat\nelevation or of Niagara as being “nice” or “pretty.” “Curious” is too\ntame a word wherewith to describe the imposing insanity of this work.\nThere is no word that is large enough or long enough. Let us, therefore,\nphotograph a passing glimpse of book and author, and trust the rest to\nthe reader. Let the cultivated English student of human nature\npicture to himself this Mark Twain as a person capable of doing the\nfollowing-described things--and not only doing them, but with incredible\ninnocence _printing them_ calmly and tranquilly in a book. For instance:\n\nHe states that he entered a hair-dresser's in Paris to get shaved, and\nthe first “rake” the barber gave him with his razor it _loosened his\n“hide”_ and _lifted him out of the chair._\n\nThis is unquestionably exaggerated. In Florence he was so annoyed by\nbeggars that he pretends to have seized and eaten one in a frantic\nspirit of revenge. There is, of course, no truth in this. He gives at\nfull length a theatrical program seventeen or eighteen hundred years\nold, which he professes to have found in the ruins of the Coliseum,\namong the dirt and mold and rubbish. It is a sufficient comment upon\nthis statement to remark that even a cast-iron program would not have\nlasted so long under such circumstances. In Greece he plainly betrays\nboth fright and flight upon one occasion, but with frozen effrontery\nputs the latter in this falsely tamed form: “We _sidled _toward the\nPiraeus.” “Sidled,” indeed! He does not hesitate to intimate that at\nEphesus, when his mule strayed from the proper course, he got down, took\nhim under his arm, carried him to the road again, pointed him right,\nremounted, and went to sleep contentedly till it was time to restore the\nbeast to the path once more. He states that a growing youth among his\nship's passengers was in the constant habit of appeasing his hunger with\nsoap and oakum between meals. In Palestine he tells of ants that\ncame eleven miles to spend the summer in the desert and brought their\nprovisions with them; yet he shows by his description of the country\nthat the feat was an impossibility. He mentions, as if it were the most\ncommonplace of matters, that he cut a Moslem in two in broad daylight\nin Jerusalem, with Godfrey de Bouillon's sword, and would have shed\nmore blood _if he had had a graveyard of his own._ These statements are\nunworthy a moment's attention. Mr. Twain or any other foreigner who did\nsuch a thing in Jerusalem would be mobbed, and would infallibly lose his\nlife. But why go on? Why repeat more of his audacious and exasperating\nfalsehoods? Let us close fittingly with this one: he affirms that “in\nthe mosque of St. Sophia at Constantinople I got my feet so stuck up\nwith a complication of gums, slime, and general impurity, that I wore\nout more than two thousand pair of bootjacks getting my boots off that\nnight, and even then some Christian hide peeled off with them.” It is\nmonstrous. Such statements are simply lies--there is no other name\nfor them. Will the reader longer marvel at the brutal ignorance that\npervades the American nation when we tell him that we are informed\nupon perfectly good authority that this extravagant compilation of\nfalsehoods, this exhaustless mine of stupendous lies, this _Innocents\nAbroad_, has actually been adopted by the schools and colleges of\nseveral of the states as a text-book!\n\nBut if his falsehoods are distressing, his innocence and his ignorance\nare enough to make one burn the book and despise the author. In one\nplace he was so appalled at the sudden spectacle of a murdered man,\nunveiled by the moonlight, that he jumped out of the window, going\nthrough sash and all, and then remarks with the most childlike\nsimplicity that he “was not scared, but was considerably agitated.”\n It puts us out of patience to note that the simpleton is densely\nunconscious that Lucrezia Borgia ever existed off the stage. He is\nvulgarly ignorant of all foreign languages, but is frank enough to\ncriticize, the Italians' use of their own tongue. He says they spell the\nname of their great painter “Vinci, but pronounce it Vinchy”--and then\nadds with a naivete possible only to helpless ignorance, “foreigners\nalways spell better than they pronounce.” In another place he commits\nthe bald absurdity of putting the phrase “tare an ouns” into an\nItalian's mouth. In Rome he unhesitatingly believes the legend that St.\nPhilip Neri's heart was so inflamed with divine love that it burst\nhis ribs--believes it wholly because an author with a learned list of\nuniversity degrees strung after his name endorses it--“otherwise,” says\nthis gentle idiot, “I should have felt a curiosity to know what Philip\nhad for dinner.” Our author makes a long, fatiguing journey to the\nGrotto del Cane on purpose to test its poisoning powers on a dog--got\nelaborately ready for the experiment, and then discovered that he had no\ndog. A wiser person would have kept such a thing discreetly to himself,\nbut with this harmless creature everything comes out. He hurts his foot\nin a rut two thousand years old in exhumed Pompeii, and presently, when\nstaring at one of the cinder-like corpses unearthed in the next square,\nconceives the idea that maybe it is the remains of the ancient Street\nCommissioner, and straightway his horror softens down to a sort of\nchirpy contentment with the condition of things. In Damascus he visits\nthe well of Ananias, three thousand years old, and is as surprised and\ndelighted as a child to find that the water is “as pure and fresh as if\nthe well had been dug yesterday.” In the Holy Land he gags desperately\nat the hard Arabic and Hebrew Biblical names, and finally concludes to\ncall them Baldwinsville, Williamsburgh, and so on, “for convenience of\nspelling.”\n\nWe have thus spoken freely of this man's stupefying simplicity and\ninnocence, but we cannot deal similarly with his colossal ignorance. We\ndo not know where to begin. And if we knew where to begin, we certainly\nwould not know where to leave off. We will give one specimen, and one\nonly. He did not know, until he got to Rome, that Michael Angelo\nwas dead! And then, instead of crawling away and hiding his shameful\nignorance somewhere, he proceeds to express a pious, grateful sort of\nsatisfaction that he is gone and out of his troubles!\n\nNo, the reader may seek out the author's exhibition of his uncultivation\nfor himself. The book is absolutely dangerous, considering the magnitude\nand variety of its misstatements, and the convincing confidence with\nwhich they are made. And yet it is a text-book in the schools of\nAmerica.\n\nThe poor blunderer mouses among the sublime creations of the Old\nMasters, trying to acquire the elegant proficiency in art-knowledge,\nwhich he has a groping sort of comprehension is a proper thing for a\ntraveled man to be able to display. But what is the manner of his study?\nAnd what is the progress he achieves? To what extent does he\nfamiliarize himself with the great pictures of Italy, and what degree of\nappreciation does he arrive at? Read:\n\n“When we see a monk going about with a lion and looking up into heaven,\nwe know that that is St. Mark. When we see a monk with a book and a pen,\nlooking tranquilly up to heaven, trying to think of a word, we know\nthat that is St. Matthew. When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking\ntranquilly up to heaven, with a human skull beside him, and without\nother baggage, we know that that is St. Jerome. Because we know that\nhe always went flying light in the matter of baggage. When we see other\nmonks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but having no trade-mark, we\nalways ask who those parties are. We do this because we humbly wish to\nlearn.”\n\nHe then enumerates the thousands and thousand of copies of these several\npictures which he has seen, and adds with accustomed simplicity that he\nfeels encouraged to believe that when he has seen “Some More” of each,\nand had a larger experience, he will eventually “begin to take an\nabsorbing interest in them”--the vulgar boor.\n\nThat we have shown this to be a remarkable book, we think no one\nwill deny. That it is a pernicious book to place in the hands of the\nconfiding and uniformed, we think we have also shown. That the book is\na deliberate and wicked creation of a diseased mind, is apparent upon\nevery page. Having placed our judgment thus upon record, let us close\nwith what charity we can, by remarking that even in this volume there is\nsome good to be found; for whenever the author talks of his own country\nand lets Europe alone, he never fails to make himself interesting, and\nnot only interesting but instructive. No one can read without benefit\nhis occasional chapters and paragraphs, about life in the gold and\nsilver mines of California and Nevada; about the Indians of the plains\nand deserts of the West, and their cannibalism; about the raising of\nvegetables in kegs of gunpowder by the aid of two or three teaspoons of\nguano; about the moving of small arms from place to place at night in\nwheelbarrows to avoid taxes; and about a sort of cows and mules in\nthe Humboldt mines, that climb down chimneys and disturb the people at\nnight. These matters are not only new, but are well worth knowing. It is\na pity the author did not put in more of the same kind. His book is well\nwritten and is exceedingly entertaining, and so it just barely escaped\nbeing quite valuable also.\n\n(One month later)\n\nLatterly I have received several letters, and see a number of newspaper\nparagraphs, all upon a certain subject, and all of about the same tenor.\nI here give honest specimens. One is from a New York paper, one is from\na letter from an old friend, and one is from a letter from a New York\npublisher who is a stranger to me. I humbly endeavor to make these bits\ntoothsome with the remark that the article they are praising (which\nappeared in the December _Galaxy_, and _pretended _to be a criticism\nfrom the London _Saturday Review_ on my _Innocents Abroad_) _was written\nby myself, every line of it_:\n\nThe _Herald _says the richest thing out is the “serious critique” in the\nLondon _Saturday Review_, on Mark Twain's _Innocents Abroad_. We thought\nbefore we read it that it must be “serious,” as everybody said so, and\nwere even ready to shed a few tears; but since perusing it, we are bound\nto confess that next to Mark Twain's “_Jumping Frog_” it's the finest\nbit of humor and sarcasm that we've come across in many a day.\n\n(I do not get a compliment like that every day.)\n\nI used to think that your writings were pretty good, but after reading\nthe criticism in _The Galaxy_ from the _London Review_, have discovered\nwhat an ass I must have been. If suggestions are in order, mine is,\nthat you put that article in your next edition of the _Innocents_, as\nan extra chapter, if you are not afraid to put your own humor in\ncompetition with it. It is as rich a thing as I ever read.\n\n(Which is strong commendation from a book publisher.)\nThe London Reviewer, my friend, is not the stupid, “serious” creature he\npretends to be, _I_ think; but, on the contrary, has a keen appreciation\nand enjoyment of your book. As I read his article in _The Galaxy_, I\ncould imagine him giving vent to many a hearty laugh. But he is writing\nfor Catholics and Established Church people, and high-toned, antiquated,\nconservative gentility, whom it is a delight to him to help you shock,\nwhile he pretends to shake his head with owlish density. He is a\nmagnificent humorist himself.\n\n(Now that is graceful and handsome. I take off my hat to my life-long\nfriend and comrade, and with my feet together and my fingers spread over\nmy heart, I say, in the language of Alabama, “You do me proud.”)\n\nI stand guilty of the authorship of the article, but I did not mean any\nharm. I saw by an item in the Boston _Advertiser_ that a solemn, serious\ncritique on the English edition of my book had appeared in the London\n_Saturday Review_, and the idea of _such _a literary breakfast by a\nstolid, ponderous British ogre of the quill was too much for a naturally\nweak virtue, and I went home and burlesqued it--reveled in it, I may\nsay. I never saw a copy of the real _Saturday Review_ criticism until\nafter my burlesque was written and mailed to the printer. But when I\ndid get hold of a copy, I found it to be vulgar, awkwardly written,\nill-natured, and entirely serious and in earnest. The gentleman who\nwrote the newspaper paragraph above quoted had not been misled as to its\ncharacter.\n\nIf any man doubts my word now, I will kill him. No, I will not kill him;\nI will win his money. I will bet him twenty to one, and let any New York\npublisher hold the stakes, that the statements I have above made as to\nthe authorship of the article in question are entirely true. Perhaps\nI may get wealthy at this, for I am willing to take all the bets that\noffer; and if a man wants larger odds, I will give him all he requires.\nBut he ought to find out whether I am betting on what is termed “a sure\nthing” or not before he ventures his money, and he can do that by\ngoing to a public library and examining the London _Saturday Review_ of\nOctober 8th, which contains the real critique.\n\nBless me, some people thought that _I_ was the “sold” person!\n\nP.S.--I cannot resist the temptation to toss in this most savory thing\nof all--this easy, graceful, philosophical disquisition, with his happy,\nchirping confidence. It is from the Cincinnati _Enquirer_:\n\nNothing is more uncertain than the value of a fine cigar. Nine smokers\nout of ten would prefer an ordinary domestic article, three for a\nquarter, to a fifty-cent Partaga, if kept in ignorance of the cost of\nthe latter. The flavor of the Partaga is too delicate for palates that\nhave been accustomed to Connecticut seed leaf. So it is with humor. The\nfiner it is in quality, the more danger of its not being recognized\nat all. Even Mark Twain has been taken in by an English review of his\n_Innocents Abroad_. Mark Twain is by no means a coarse humorist, but the\nEnglishman's humor is so much finer than his, that he mistakes it for\nsolid earnest, and “larfs most consumedly.”\n\nA man who cannot learn stands in his own light. Hereafter, when I write\nan article which I know to be good, but which I may have reason to fear\nwill not, in some quarters, be considered to amount to much, coming\nfrom an American, I will aver that an Englishman wrote it and that it\nis copied from a London journal. And then I will occupy a back seat and\nenjoy the cordial applause.\n\n(Still later)\n\nMark Twain at last sees that the _Saturday Review's_ criticism of his\n_Innocents Abroad_ was not serious, and he is intensely mortified at the\nthought of having been so badly sold. He takes the only course left him,\nand in the last _Galaxy _claims that _he _wrote the criticism himself,\nand published it in _The Galaxy_ to sell the public. This is ingenious,\nbut unfortunately it is not true. If any of our readers will take the\ntrouble to call at this office we sill show them the original article\nin the _Saturday Review_ of October 8th, which, on comparison, will be\nfound to be identical with the one published in _The Galaxy._ The best\nthing for Mark to do will be to admit that he was sold, and say no more\nabout it.\n\n\nThe above is from the Cincinnati _Enquirer_, and is a falsehood. Come to\nthe proof. If the _Enquirer _people, through any agent, will produce\nat _The Galaxy_ office a London _Saturday Review_ of October 8th,\ncontaining an article which, on comparison, will be found to be\nidentical with the one published in _The Galaxy_, I will pay to that\nagent five hundred dollars cash. Moreover, if at any specified time I\nfail to produce at the same place a copy of the London _Saturday Review_\nof October 8th, containing a lengthy criticism upon the _Innocents\nAbroad_, entirely different, in every paragraph and sentence, from the\none I published in _The Galaxy,_ I will pay to the _Enquirer_ agent\nanother five hundred dollars cash. I offer Sheldon & Co., publishers,\n500 Broadway, New York, as my “backers.” Any one in New York, authorized\nby the _Enquirer_, will receive prompt attention. It is an easy and\nprofitable way for the _Enquirer _people to prove that they have not\nuttered a pitiful, deliberate falsehood in the above paragraphs. Will\nthey swallow that falsehood ignominiously, or will they send an agent to\n_ The Galaxy _office. I think the Cincinnati _Enquirer _must be edited\nby children.\n\n\n\nA LETTER TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\n\nRiverdale-on-the-Hudson, OCTOBER 15, 1902.\n\n_The Hon. The Secretary Of The Treasury,_ WASHINGTON, D. C.:\n\nSir,--Prices for the customary kinds of winter fuel having reached\nan altitude which puts them out of the reach of literary persons in\nstraitened circumstances, I desire to place with you the following\norder:\n\nForty-five tons best old dry government bonds, suitable for furnace,\ngold 7 per cents., 1864, preferred.\n\nTwelve tons early greenbacks, range size, suitable for cooking.\n\nEight barrels seasoned 25 and 50 cent postal currency, vintage of 1866,\neligible for kindlings.\n\nPlease deliver with all convenient despatch at my house in Riverdale at\nlowest rates for spot cash, and send bill to\n\nYour obliged servant,\n\nMark Twain, Who will be very grateful, and will vote right.\n\n\n\nAMENDED OBITUARIES\n\nTO THE EDITOR:\n\nSir,--I am approaching seventy; it is in sight; it is only three years\naway. Necessarily, I must go soon. It is but matter-of-course wisdom,\nthen, that I should begin to set my worldly house in order now, so that\nit may be done calmly and with thoroughness, in place of waiting until\nthe last day, when, as we have often seen, the attempt to set both\nhouses in order at the same time has been marred by the necessity for\nhaste and by the confusion and waste of time arising from the inability\nof the notary and the ecclesiastic to work together harmoniously, taking\nturn about and giving each other friendly assistance--not perhaps in\nfielding, which could hardly be expected, but at least in the minor\noffices of keeping game and umpiring; by consequence of which conflict\nof interests and absence of harmonious action a draw has frequently\nresulted where this ill-fortune could not have happened if the houses\nhad been set in order one at a time and hurry avoided by beginning in\nseason, and giving to each the amount of time fairly and justly proper\nto it.\n\nIn setting my earthly house in order I find it of moment that I should\nattend in person to one or two matters which men in my position have\nlong had the habit of leaving wholly to others, with consequences often\nmost regrettable. I wish to speak of only one of these matters at this\ntime: Obituaries. Of necessity, an Obituary is a thing which cannot be\nso judiciously edited by any hand as by that of the subject of it. In\nsuch a work it is not the Facts that are of chief importance, but the\nlight which the obituarist shall throw upon them, the meaning which he\nshall dress them in, the conclusions which he shall draw from them,\nand the judgments which he shall deliver upon them. The Verdicts, you\nunderstand: that is the danger-line.\n\nIn considering this matter, in view of my approaching change, it has\nseemed to me wise to take such measures as may be feasible, to acquire,\nby courtesy of the press, access to my standing obituaries, with the\nprivilege--if this is not asking too much--of editing, not their Facts,\nbut their Verdicts. This, not for the present profit, further than as\nconcerns my family, but as a favorable influence usable on the Other\nSide, where there are some who are not friendly to me.\n\nWith this explanation of my motives, I will now ask you of your courtesy\nto make an appeal for me to the public press. It is my desire that\nsuch journals and periodicals as have obituaries of me lying in their\npigeonholes, with a view to sudden use some day, will not wait longer,\nbut will publish them now, and kindly send me a marked copy. My address\nis simply New York City--I have no other that is permanent and not\ntransient.\n\nI will correct them--not the Facts, but the Verdicts--striking out such\nclauses as could have a deleterious influence on the Other Side, and\nreplacing them with clauses of a more judicious character. I should,\nof course, expect to pay double rates for both the omissions and the\nsubstitutions; and I should also expect to pay quadruple rates for\nall obituaries which proved to be rightly and wisely worded in the\noriginals, thus requiring no emendations at all.\n\nIt is my desire to leave these Amended Obituaries neatly bound behind\nme as a perennial consolation and entertainment to my family, and as an\nheirloom which shall have a mournful but definite commercial value for\nmy remote posterity.\n\nI beg, sir, that you will insert this Advertisement (1t-eow, agate,\ninside), and send the bill to\n\nYours very respectfully.\n\nMark Twain.\n\nP.S.--For the best Obituary--one suitable for me to read in public, and\ncalculated to inspire regret--I desire to offer a Prize, consisting of\na Portrait of me done entirely by myself in pen and ink without previous\ninstructions. The ink warranted to be the kind used by the very best\nartists.\n\n\n\nA MONUMENT TO ADAM\n\nSome one has revealed to the _Tribune _that I once suggested to Rev.\nThomas K. Beecher, of Elmira, New York, that we get up a monument to\nAdam, and that Mr. Beecher favored the project. There is more to it\nthan that. The matter started as a joke, but it came somewhat near to\nmaterializing.\n\nIt is long ago--thirty years. Mr. Darwin's _Descent of Man_ has been in\nprint five or six years, and the storm of indignation raised by it was\nstill raging in pulpits and periodicals. In tracing the genesis of the\nhuman race back to its sources, Mr. Darwin had left Adam out altogether.\nWe had monkeys, and “missing links,” and plenty of other kinds of\nancestors, but no Adam. Jesting with Mr. Beecher and other friends in\nElmira, I said there seemed to be a likelihood that the world would\ndiscard Adam and accept the monkey, and that in the course of time\nAdam's very name would be forgotten in the earth; therefore this\ncalamity ought to be averted; a monument would accomplish this, and\nElmira ought not to waste this honorable opportunity to do Adam a favor\nand herself a credit.\n\nThen the unexpected happened. Two bankers came forward and took hold of\nthe matter--not for fun, not for sentiment, but because they saw in the\nmonument certain commercial advantages for the town. The project had\nseemed gently humorous before--it was more than that now, with this\nstern business gravity injected into it. The bankers discussed the\nmonument with me. We met several times. They proposed an indestructible\nmemorial, to cost twenty-five thousand dollars. The insane oddity of a\nmonument set up in a village to preserve a name that would outlast the\nhills and the rocks without any such help, would advertise Elmira to the\nends of the earth--and draw custom. It would be the only monument on the\nplanet to Adam, and in the matter of interest and impressiveness could\nnever have a rival until somebody should set up a monument to the Milky\nWay.\n\nPeople would come from every corner of the globe and stop off to look\nat it, no tour of the world would be complete that left out Adam's\nmonument. Elmira would be a Mecca; there would be pilgrim ships at\npilgrim rates, pilgrim specials on the continent's railways; libraries\nwould be written about the monument, every tourist would kodak it,\nmodels of it would be for sale everywhere in the earth, its form would\nbecome as familiar as the figure of Napoleon.\n\nOne of the bankers subscribed five thousand dollars, and I think the\nother one subscribed half as much, but I do not remember with certainty\nnow whether that was the figure or not. We got designs made--some of\nthem came from Paris.\n\nIn the beginning--as a detail of the project when it was yet a joke--I\nhad framed a humble and beseeching and perfervid petition to Congress\nbegging the government to build the monument, as a testimony of the\nGreat Republic's gratitude to the Father of the Human Race and as a\ntoken of her loyalty to him in this dark day of humiliation when his\nolder children were doubting and deserting him. It seemed to me that\nthis petition ought to be presented, now--it would be widely and\nfeelingly abused and ridiculed and cursed, and would advertise our\nscheme and make our ground-floor stock go off briskly. So I sent it\nto General Joseph R. Hawley, who was then in the House, and he said he\nwould present it. But he did not do it. I think he explained that when\nhe came to read it he was afraid of it: it was too serious, to gushy,\ntoo sentimental--the House might take it for earnest.\n\nWe ought to have carried out our monument scheme; we could have managed\nit without any great difficulty, and Elmira would now be the most\ncelebrated town in the universe.\n\nVery recently I began to build a book in which one of the minor\ncharacters touches incidentally upon a project for a monument to Adam,\nand now the _Tribune _has come upon a trace of the forgotten jest of\nthirty years ago. Apparently mental telegraphy is still in business. It\nis odd; but the freaks of mental telegraphy are usually odd.\n\n\n\nA HUMANE WORD FROM SATAN\n\n(The following letter, signed by Satan and purporting to come from\nhim, we have reason to believe was not written by him, but by Mark\nTwain.--Editor.)\n\nTO THE EDITOR OF HARPER'S WEEKLY:\n\nDear Sir and Kinsman,--Let us have done with this frivolous talk.\nThe American Board accepts contributions from me every year: then why\nshouldn't it from Mr. Rockefeller? In all the ages, three-fourths of the\nsupport of the great charities has been conscience-money, as my books\nwill show: then what becomes of the sting when that term is applied to\nMr. Rockefeller's gift? The American Board's trade is financed mainly\nfrom the graveyards. Bequests, you understand. Conscience-money.\nConfession of an old crime and deliberate perpetration of a new one;\nfor deceased's contribution is a robbery of his heirs. Shall the Board\ndecline bequests because they stand for one of these offenses every time\nand generally for both?\n\nAllow me to continue. The charge most persistently and resentfully\nand remorselessly dwelt upon is that Mr. Rockefeller's contribution is\nincurably tainted by perjury--perjury proved against him in the courts.\n_It makes us smile_--down in my place! Because there isn't a rich man\nin your vast city who doesn't perjure himself every year before the tax\nboard. They are all caked with perjury, many layers thick. Iron-clad,\nso to speak. If there is one that isn't, I desire to acquire him for my\nmuseum, and will pay Dinosaur rates. Will you say it isn't infraction\nof the law, but only annual evasion of it? Comfort yourselves with that\nnice distinction if you like--_for the present_. But by and by, when\nyou arrive, I will show you something interesting: a whole hell-full\nof evaders! Sometimes a frank law-breaker turns up elsewhere, but I get\nthose others every time.\n\nTo return to my muttons. I wish you to remember that my rich perjurers\nare contributing to the American Board with frequency: it is money\nfilched from the sworn-off personal tax; therefore it is the wages of\nsin; therefore it is my money; therefore it is _I_ that contribute it;\nand, finally, it is therefore as I have said: since the Board daily\naccepts contributions from me, why should it decline them from Mr.\nRockefeller, who is as good as I am, let the courts say what they may?\n\nSatan.\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO “THE NEW GUIDE OF THE CONVERSATION IN PORTUGUESE AND\nENGLISH”\n\nby Pedro Carolino\n\nIn this world of uncertainties, there is, at any rate, one thing which\nmay be pretty confidently set down as a certainty: and that is, that\nthis celebrated little phrase-book will never die while the English\nlanguage lasts. Its delicious unconscious ridiculousness, and its\nenchanting naivete, are as supreme and unapproachable, in their way,\nas are Shakespeare's sublimities. Whatsoever is perfect in its kind, in\nliterature, is imperishable: nobody can imitate it successfully, nobody\ncan hope to produce its fellow; it is perfect, it must and will stand\nalone: its immortality is secure.\n\nIt is one of the smallest books in the world, but few big books have\nreceived such wide attention, and been so much pondered by the grave and\nlearned, and so much discussed and written about by the thoughtful,\nthe thoughtless, the wise, and the foolish. Long notices of it have\nappeared, from time to time, in the great English reviews, and in\nerudite and authoritative philological periodicals; and it has been\nlaughed at, danced upon, and tossed in a blanket by nearly every\nnewspaper and magazine in the English-speaking world. Every scribbler,\nalmost, has had his little fling at it, at one time or another; I had\nmine fifteen years ago. The book gets out of print, every now and then,\nand one ceases to hear of it for a season; but presently the nations and\nnear and far colonies of our tongue and lineage call for it once more,\nand once more it issues from some London or Continental or American\npress, and runs a new course around the globe, wafted on its way by the\nwind of a world's laughter.\n\nMany persons have believed that this book's miraculous stupidities\nwere studied and disingenuous; but no one can read the volume carefully\nthrough and keep that opinion. It was written in serious good faith and\ndeep earnestness, by an honest and upright idiot who believed he knew\nsomething of the English language, and could impart his knowledge to\nothers. The amplest proof of this crops out somewhere or other upon each\nand every page. There are sentences in the book which could have been\nmanufactured by a man in his right mind, and with an intelligent and\ndeliberate purposes to seem innocently ignorant; but there are other\nsentences, and paragraphs, which no mere pretended ignorance could ever\nachieve--nor yet even the most genuine and comprehensive ignorance, when\nunbacked by inspiration.\n\nIt is not a fraud who speaks in the following paragraph of the author's\nPreface, but a good man, an honest man, a man whose conscience is at\nrest, a man who believes he has done a high and worthy work for his\nnation and his generation, and is well pleased with his performance:\n\nWe expect then, who the little book (for the care what we wrote him, and\nfor her typographical correction) that may be worth the acceptation of\nthe studious persons, and especially of the Youth, at which we dedicate\nhim particularly.\n\nOne cannot open this book anywhere and not find richness. To prove that\nthis is true, I will open it at random and copy the page I happen to\nstumble upon. Here is the result:\n\nDIALOGUE 16\n\nFor To See the Town\n\nAnothony, go to accompany they gentilsmen, do they see the town.\n\nWe won't to see all that is it remarquable here.\n\nCome with me, if you please. I shall not folget nothing what can to\nmerit your attention. Here we are near to cathedral; will you come in\nthere?\n\nWe will first to see him in oudside, after we shall go in there for to\nlook the interior.\n\nAdmire this master piece gothic architecture's.\n\nThe chasing of all they figures is astonishing' indeed.\n\nThe cupola and the nave are not less curious to see.\n\nWhat is this palace how I see yonder?\n\nIt is the town hall.\n\nAnd this tower here at this side?\n\nIt is the Observatory.\n\nThe bridge is very fine, it have ten arches, and is constructed of free\nstone.\n\nThe streets are very layed out by line and too paved.\n\nWhat is the circuit of this town?\n\nTwo leagues.\n\nThere is it also hospitals here?\n\nIt not fail them.\n\nWhat are then the edifices the worthest to have seen?\n\nIt is the arsnehal, the spectacle's hall, the Cusiomhouse, and the\nPurse.\n\nWe are going too see the others monuments such that the public\npawnbroker's office, the plants garden's, the money office's, the\nlibrary.\n\nThat it shall be for another day; we are tired.\n\nDIALOGUE 17\n\nTo Inform One'self of a Person\n\nHow is that gentilman who you did speak by and by?\n\nIs a German.\n\nI did think him Englishman.\n\nHe is of the Saxony side.\n\nHe speak the french very well.\n\nTough he is German, he speak so much well italyan, french, spanish and\nenglish, that among the Italyans, they believe him Italyan, he speak\nthe frenche as the Frenches himselves. The Spanishesmen believe him\nSpanishing, and the Englishes, Englishman. It is difficult to enjoy well\nso much several languages.\n\nThe last remark contains a general truth; but it ceases to be a truth\nwhen one contracts it and applies it to an individual--provided that that\nindividual is the author of this book, Senhor Pedro Carolino. I am\nsure I should not find it difficult “to enjoy well so much several\nlanguages”--or even a thousand of them--if he did the translating for me\nfrom the originals into his ostensible English.\n\n\n\nADVICE TO LITTLE GIRLS\n\nGood little girls ought not to make mouths at their teachers for every\ntrifling offense. This retaliation should only be resorted to under\npeculiarly aggravated circumstances.\n\nIf you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust, while one of\nyour more fortunate little playmates has a costly China one, you should\ntreat her with a show of kindness nevertheless. And you ought not to\nattempt to make a forcible swap with her unless your conscience would\njustify you in it, and you know you are able to do it.\n\nYou ought never to take your little brother's “chewing-gum” away from\nhim by main force; it is better to rope him in with the promise of\nthe first two dollars and a half you find floating down the river on a\ngrindstone. In the artless simplicity natural to this time of life, he\nwill regard it as a perfectly fair transaction. In all ages of the\nworld this eminently plausible fiction has lured the obtuse infant to\nfinancial ruin and disaster.\n\nIf at any time you find it necessary to correct your brother, do not\ncorrect him with mud--never, on any account, throw mud at him, because\nit will spoil his clothes. It is better to scald him a little, for then\nyou obtain desirable results. You secure his immediate attention to the\nlessons you are inculcating, and at the same time your hot water will\nhave a tendency to move impurities from his person, and possibly the\nskin, in spots.\n\nIf your mother tells you to do a thing, it is wrong to reply that you\nwon't. It is better and more becoming to intimate that you will do as\nshe bids you, and then afterward act quietly in the matter according to\nthe dictates of your best judgment.\n\nYou should ever bear in mind that it is to your kind parents that you\nare indebted for your food, and for the privilege of staying home from\nschool when you let on that you are sick. Therefore you ought to respect\ntheir little prejudices, and humor their little whims, and put up with\ntheir little foibles until they get to crowding you too much.\n\nGood little girls always show marked deference for the aged. You ought\nnever to “sass” old people unless they “sass” you first.\n\n\n\nPOST-MORTEM POETRY (1)\n\nIn Philadelphia they have a custom which it would be pleasant to see\nadopted throughout the land. It is that of appending to published\ndeath-notices a little verse or two of comforting poetry. Any one who is\nin the habit of reading the daily Philadelphia _Ledger _must frequently\nbe touched by these plaintive tributes to extinguished worth. In\nPhiladelphia, the departure of a child is a circumstance which is not\nmore surely followed by a burial than by the accustomed solacing poesy\nin the _Public Ledger_. In that city death loses half its terror because\nthe knowledge of its presence comes thus disguised in the sweet drapery\nof verse. For instance, in a late _Ledger _I find the following (I\nchange the surname):\n\nDIED\n\nHawks.--On the 17th inst., Clara, the daughter of Ephraim and Laura\nHawks, aged 21 months and 2 days.\n\n\nThat merry shout no more I hear, No laughing child I see, No little arms\nare around my neck, No feet upon my knee;\n\nNo kisses drop upon my cheek, These lips are sealed to me. Dear Lord,\nhow could I give Clara up To any but to Thee?\n\nA child thus mourned could not die wholly discontented. From the _Ledger\n_of the same date I make the following extract, merely changing the\nsurname, as before:\n\nBecket.--On Sunday morning, 19th inst., John P., infant son of George\nand Julia Becket, aged 1 year, 6 months, and 15 days.\n\n\nThat merry shout no more I hear, No laughing child I see, No little arms\nare round my neck, No feet upon my knee;\n\nNo kisses drop upon my cheek; These lips are sealed to me. Dear Lord,\nhow could I give Johnnie up To any but to Thee?\n\nThe similarity of the emotions as produced in the mourners in these two\ninstances is remarkably evidenced by the singular similarity of thought\nwhich they experienced, and the surprising coincidence of language used\nby them to give it expression.\n\nIn the same journal, of the same date, I find the following (surname\nsuppressed, as before):\n\nWagner.--On the 10th inst., Ferguson G., the son of William L. and\nMartha Theresa Wagner, aged 4 weeks and 1 day.\n\n\nThat merry shout no more I hear, No laughing child I see, No little arms\nare round my neck, No feet upon my knee;\n\nNo kisses drop upon my cheek, These lips are sealed to me. Dear Lord,\nhow could I give Ferguson up To any but to Thee?\n\nIt is strange what power the reiteration of an essentially poetical\nthought has upon one's feelings. When we take up the _Ledger _and read\nthe poetry about little Clara, we feel an unaccountable depression of\nthe spirits. When we drift further down the column and read the poetry\nabout little Johnnie, the depression and spirits acquires an added\nemphasis, and we experience tangible suffering. When we saunter along\ndown the column further still and read the poetry about little Ferguson,\nthe word torture but vaguely suggests the anguish that rends us.\n\nIn the _Ledger _(same copy referred to above) I find the following (I\nalter surname, as usual):\n\nWelch.--On the 5th inst., Mary C. Welch, wife of William B. Welch, and\ndaughter of Catharine and George W. Markland, in the 29th year of her\nage.\n\n\nA mother dear, a mother kind, Has gone and left us all behind. Cease to\nweep, for tears are vain, Mother dear is out of pain.\n\nFarewell, husband, children dear, Serve thy God with filial fear, And\nmeet me in the land above, Where all is peace, and joy, and love.\n\nWhat could be sweeter than that? No collection of salient facts (without\nreduction to tabular form) could be more succinctly stated than is done\nin the first stanza by the surviving relatives, and no more concise and\ncomprehensive program of farewells, post-mortuary general orders, etc.,\ncould be framed in any form than is done in verse by deceased in the\nlast stanza. These things insensibly make us wiser and tenderer, and\nbetter. Another extract:\n\nBall.--On the morning of the 15th inst., Mary E., daughter of John and\nSarah F. Ball.\n\n\n'Tis sweet to rest in lively hope That when my change shall come Angels\nwill hover round my bed, To waft my spirit home.\n\nThe following is apparently the customary form for heads of families:\n\nBurns.--On the 20th inst., Michael Burns, aged 40 years.\n\n\nDearest father, thou hast left us, Here thy loss we deeply feel; But\n'tis God that has bereft us, He can all our sorrows heal.\n\nFuneral at 2 o'clock sharp.\n\nThere is something very simple and pleasant about the following, which,\nin Philadelphia, seems to be the usual form for consumptives of long\nstanding. (It deplores four distinct cases in the single copy of the\n_Ledger _which lies on the Memoranda editorial table):\n\nBromley.--On the 29th inst., of consumption, Philip Bromley, in the 50th\nyear of his age.\n\n\nAffliction sore long time he bore, Physicians were in vain-- Till God at\nlast did hear him mourn, And eased him of his pain.\n\nThat friend whom death from us has torn, We did not think so soon to\npart; An anxious care now sinks the thorn Still deeper in our bleeding\nheart.\n\nThis beautiful creation loses nothing by repetition. On the\ncontrary, the oftener one sees it in the _Ledger_, the more grand and\nawe-inspiring it seems.\n\nWith one more extract I will close:\n\nDoble.--On the 4th inst., Samuel Pervil Worthington Doble, aged 4 days.\n\n\nOur little Sammy's gone, His tiny spirit's fled; Our little boy we loved\nso dear Lies sleeping with the dead.\n\nA tear within a father's eye, A mother's aching heart, Can only tell the\nagony How hard it is to part.\n\nCould anything be more plaintive than that, without requiring further\nconcessions of grammar? Could anything be likely to do more toward\nreconciling deceased to circumstances, and making him willing to go?\nPerhaps not. The power of song can hardly be estimated. There is an\nelement about some poetry which is able to make even physical suffering\nand death cheerful things to contemplate and consummations to be\ndesired. This element is present in the mortuary poetry of Philadelphia,\nand in a noticeable degree of development.\n\nThe custom I have been treating of is one that should be adopted in all\nthe cities of the land.\n\nIt is said that once a man of small consequence died, and the Rev. T.\nK. Beecher was asked to preach the funeral sermon--a man who abhors the\nlauding of people, either dead or alive, except in dignified and simple\nlanguage, and then only for merits which they actually possessed or\npossess, not merits which they merely ought to have possessed. The\nfriends of the deceased got up a stately funeral. They must have had\nmisgivings that the corpse might not be praised strongly enough, for\nthey prepared some manuscript headings and notes in which nothing was\nleft unsaid on that subject that a fervid imagination and an unabridged\ndictionary could compile, and these they handed to the minister as he\nentered the pulpit. They were merely intended as suggestions, and so the\nfriends were filled with consternation when the minister stood in the\npulpit and proceeded to read off the curious odds and ends in ghastly\ndetail and in a loud voice! And their consternation solidified to\npetrification when he paused at the end, contemplated the multitude\nreflectively, and then said, impressively:\n\n“The man would be a fool who tried to add anything to that. Let us\npray!”\n\nAnd with the same strict adhesion to truth it can be said that the man\nwould be a fool who tried to add anything to the following transcendent\nobituary poem. There is something so innocent, so guileless, so\ncomplacent, so unearthly serene and self-satisfied about this peerless\n“hog-wash,” that the man must be made of stone who can read it without a\ndulcet ecstasy creeping along his backbone and quivering in his marrow.\nThere is no need to say that this poem is genuine and in earnest, for\nits proofs are written all over its face. An ingenious scribbler\nmight imitate it after a fashion, but Shakespeare himself could not\ncounterfeit it. It is noticeable that the country editor who published\nit did not know that it was a treasure and the most perfect thing of its\nkind that the storehouses and museums of literature could show. He did\nnot dare to say no to the dread poet--for such a poet must have been\nsomething of an apparition--but he just shoveled it into his paper\nanywhere that came handy, and felt ashamed, and put that disgusted\n“Published by Request” over it, and hoped that his subscribers would\noverlook it or not feel an impulse to read it:\n\n(Published by Request)\n\nLINES\n\nComposed on the death of Samuel and Catharine Belknap's children\n\nby M. A. Glaze\n\n\nFriends and neighbors all draw near, And listen to what I have to say;\nAnd never leave your children dear When they are small, and go away.\n\nBut always think of that sad fate, That happened in year of '63; Four\nchildren with a house did burn, Think of their awful agony.\n\nTheir mother she had gone away, And left them there alone to stay; The\nhouse took fire and down did burn; Before their mother did return.\n\nTheir piteous cry the neighbors heard, And then the cry of fire was\ngiven; But, ah! before they could them reach, Their little spirits had\nflown to heaven.\n\nTheir father he to war had gone, And on the battle-field was slain; But\nlittle did he think when he went away, But what on earth they would meet\nagain.\n\nThe neighbors often told his wife Not to leave his children there,\nUnless she got some one to stay, And of the little ones take care.\n\nThe oldest he was years not six, And the youngest only eleven months\nold, But often she had left them there alone, As, by the neighbors, I\nhave been told.\n\nHow can she bear to see the place. Where she so oft has left them there,\nWithout a single one to look to them, Or of the little ones to take good\ncare.\n\nOh, can she look upon the spot, Whereunder their little burnt bones lay,\nBut what she thinks she hears them say, ''Twas God had pity, and took us\non high.'\n\nAnd there may she kneel down and pray, And ask God her to forgive; And\nshe may lead a different life While she on earth remains to live.\n\nHer husband and her children too, God has took from pain and woe. May\nshe reform and mend her ways, That she may also to them go.\n\nAnd when it is God's holy will, O, may she be prepared To meet her God\nand friends in peace, And leave this world of care.\n\n1. Written in 1870.\n\n\n\nTHE DANGER OF LYING IN BED\n\nThe man in the ticket-office said:\n\n“Have an accident insurance ticket, also?”\n\n“No,” I said, after studying the matter over a little. “No, I believe\nnot; I am going to be traveling by rail all day today. However, tomorrow\nI don't travel. Give me one for tomorrow.”\n\nThe man looked puzzled. He said:\n\n“But it is for accident insurance, and if you are going to travel by\nrail--”\n\n“If I am going to travel by rail I sha'n't need it. Lying at home in bed\nis the thing _I_ am afraid of.”\n\nI had been looking into this matter. Last year I traveled twenty\nthousand miles, almost entirely by rail; the year before, I traveled\nover twenty-five thousand miles, half by sea and half by rail; and the\nyear before that I traveled in the neighborhood of ten thousand miles,\nexclusively by rail. I suppose if I put in all the little odd journeys\nhere and there, I may say I have traveled sixty thousand miles during\nthe three years I have mentioned. _And never an accident._\n\nFor a good while I said to myself every morning: “Now I have escaped\nthus far, and so the chances are just that much increased that I shall\ncatch it this time. I will be shrewd, and buy an accident ticket.” And\nto a dead moral certainty I drew a blank, and went to bed that night\nwithout a joint started or a bone splintered. I got tired of that sort\nof daily bother, and fell to buying accident tickets that were good\nfor a month. I said to myself, “A man _can't_ buy thirty blanks in one\nbundle.”\n\nBut I was mistaken. There was never a prize in the the lot. I could read\nof railway accidents every day--the newspaper atmosphere was foggy with\nthem; but somehow they never came my way. I found I had spent a good\ndeal of money in the accident business, and had nothing to show for it.\nMy suspicions were aroused, and I began to hunt around for somebody that\nhad won in this lottery. I found plenty of people who had invested,\nbut not an individual that had ever had an accident or made a cent. I\nstopped buying accident tickets and went to ciphering. The result was\nastounding. THE PERIL LAY NOT IN TRAVELING, BUT IN STAYING AT HOME.\n\nI hunted up statistics, and was amazed to find that after all the\nglaring newspaper headlines concerning railroad disasters, less than\n_three hundred_ people had really lost their lives by those disasters\nin the preceding twelve months. The Erie road was set down as the most\nmurderous in the list. It had killed forty-six--or twenty-six, I do not\nexactly remember which, but I know the number was double that of any\nother road. But the fact straightway suggested itself that the Erie was\nan immensely long road, and did more business than any other line in\nthe country; so the double number of killed ceased to be matter for\nsurprise.\n\nBy further figuring, it appeared that between New York and Rochester the\nErie ran eight passenger-trains each way every day--16 altogether; and\ncarried a daily average of 6,000 persons. That is about a million in six\nmonths--the population of New York City. Well, the Erie kills from 13 to\n23 persons of _its_ million in six months; and in the same time 13,000\nof New York's million die in their beds! My flesh crept, my hair stood\non end. “This is appalling!” I said. “The danger isn't in traveling by\nrail, but in trusting to those deadly beds. I will never sleep in a bed\nagain.”\n\nI had figured on considerably less than one-half the length of the Erie\nroad. It was plain that the entire road must transport at least eleven\nor twelve thousand people every day. There are many short roads running\nout of Boston that do fully half as much; a great many such roads. There\nare many roads scattered about the Union that do a prodigious passenger\nbusiness. Therefore it was fair to presume that an average of 2,500\npassengers a day for each road in the country would be almost correct.\nThere are 846 railway lines in our country, and 846 times 2,500 are\n2,115,000. So the railways of America move more than two millions of\npeople every day; six hundred and fifty millions of people a year,\nwithout counting the Sundays. They do that, too--there is no question\nabout it; though where they get the raw material is clear beyond the\njurisdiction of my arithmetic; for I have hunted the census through and\nthrough, and I find that there are not that many people in the United\nStates, by a matter of six hundred and ten millions at the very least.\nThey must use some of the same people over again, likely.\n\nSan Francisco is one-eighth as populous as New York; there are 60 deaths\na week in the former and 500 a week in the latter--if they have luck.\nThat is 3,120 deaths a year in San Francisco, and eight times as many\nin New York--say about 25,000 or 26,000. The health of the two places is\nthe same. So we will let it stand as a fair presumption that this will\nhold good all over the country, and that consequently 25,000 out of\nevery million of people we have must die every year. That amounts to\none-fortieth of our total population. One million of us, then, die\nannually. Out of this million ten or twelve thousand are stabbed, shot,\ndrowned, hanged, poisoned, or meet a similarly violent death in some\nother popular way, such as perishing by kerosene-lamp and hoop-skirt\nconflagrations, getting buried in coal-mines, falling off house-tops,\nbreaking through church, or lecture-room floors, taking patent\nmedicines, or committing suicide in other forms. The Erie railroad kills\n23 to 46; the other 845 railroads kill an average of one-third of a man\neach; and the rest of that million, amounting in the aggregate to that\nappalling figure of 987,631 corpses, die naturally in their beds!\n\nYou will excuse me from taking any more chances on those beds. The\nrailroads are good enough for me.\n\nAnd my advice to all people is, Don't stay at home any more than you can\nhelp; but when you have _got _to stay at home a while, buy a package of\nthose insurance tickets and sit up nights. You cannot be too cautious.\n\n(One can see now why I answered that ticket-agent in the manner recorded\nat the top of this sketch.)\n\nThe moral of this composition is, that thoughtless people grumble more\nthan is fair about railroad management in the United States. When we\nconsider that every day and night of the year full fourteen thousand\nrailway-trains of various kinds, freighted with life and armed with\ndeath, go thundering over the land, the marvel is, _not _that they kill\nthree hundred human beings in a twelvemonth, but that they do not kill\nthree hundred times three hundred!\n\n\n\nPORTRAIT OF KING WILLIAM III\n\nI never can look at those periodical portraits in _The Galaxy_ magazine\nwithout feeling a wild, tempestuous ambition to be an artist. I have\nseen thousands and thousands of pictures in my time--acres of them here\nand leagues of them in the galleries of Europe--but never any that moved\nme as these portraits do.\n\nThere is a portrait of Monsignore Capel in the November number, now\n_could_ anything be sweeter than that? And there was Bismarck's, in the\nOctober number; who can look at that without being purer and stronger\nand nobler for it? And Thurlow and Weed's picture in the September\nnumber; I would not have died without seeing that, no, not for anything\nthis world can give. But look back still further and recall my own\nlikeness as printed in the August number; if I had been in my grave a\nthousand years when that appeared, I would have got up and visited the\nartist.\n\nI sleep with all these portraits under my pillow every night, so that I\ncan go on studying them as soon as the day dawns in the morning. I know\nthem all as thoroughly as if I had made them myself; I know every line\nand mark about them. Sometimes when company are present I shuffle the\nportraits all up together, and then pick them out one by one and call\ntheir names, without referring to the printing on the bottom. I seldom\nmake a mistake--never, when I am calm.\n\nI have had the portraits framed for a long time, waiting till my aunt\ngets everything ready for hanging them up in the parlor. But first one\nthing and then another interferes, and so the thing is delayed. Once she\nsaid they would have more of the peculiar kind of light they needed in\nthe attic. The old simpleton! it is as dark as a tomb up there. But she\ndoes not know anything about art, and so she has no reverence for it.\nWhen I showed her my “Map of the Fortifications of Paris,” she said it\nwas rubbish.\n\nWell, from nursing those portraits so long, I have come at last to have\na perfect infatuation for art. I have a teacher now, and my enthusiasm\ncontinually and tumultuously grows, as I learn to use with more and\nmore facility the pencil, brush, and graver. I am studying under De\nMellville, the house and portrait painter. (His name was Smith when he\nlived in the West.) He does any kind of artist work a body wants, having\na genius that is universal, like Michael Angelo. Resembles that great\nartist, in fact. The back of his head is like his, and he wears his\nhat-brim tilted down on his nose to expose it.\n\nI have been studying under De Mellville several months now. The first\nmonth I painted fences, and gave general satisfaction. The next month I\nwhite-washed a barn. The third, I was doing tin roofs; the forth, common\nsigns; the fifth, statuary to stand before cigar shops. This present\nmonth is only the sixth, and I am already in portraits!\n\nThe humble offering which accompanies these remarks (see figure)--the\nportrait of his Majesty William III., King of Prussia--is my fifth\nattempt in portraits, and my greatest success. It has received unbounded\npraise from all classes of the community, but that which gratifies me\nmost is the frequent and cordial verdict that it resembles the _Galaxy_\nportraits. Those were my first love, my earliest admiration, the\noriginal source and incentive of my art-ambition. Whatever I am in Art\ntoday, I owe to these portraits. I ask no credit for myself--I deserve\nnone. And I never take any, either. Many a stranger has come to my\nexhibition (for I have had my portrait of King William on exhibition at\none dollar a ticket), and would have gone away blessing_ me_, if I had\nlet him, but I never did. I always stated where I got the idea.\n\nKing William wears large bushy side-whiskers, and some critics have\nthought that this portrait would be more complete if they were added.\nBut it was not possible. There was not room for side-whiskers and\nepaulets both, and so I let the whiskers go, and put in the epaulets,\nfor the sake of style. That thing on his hat is an eagle. The Prussian\neagle--it is a national emblem. When I say hat I mean helmet; but it\nseems impossible to make a picture of a helmet that a body can have\nconfidence in.\n\nI wish kind friends everywhere would aid me in my endeavor to attract a\nlittle attention to the _Galaxy _portraits. I feel persuaded it can be\naccomplished, if the course to be pursued be chosen with judgment. I\nwrite for that magazine all the time, and so do many abler men, and if\nI can get these portraits into universal favor, it is all I ask; the\nreading-matter will take care of itself.\n\n\n\nCOMMENDATIONS OF THE PORTRAIT\n\nThere is nothing like it in the Vatican. Pius IX.\n\nIt has none of that vagueness, that dreamy spirituality about it, which\nmany of the first critics of Arkansas have objected to in the Murillo\nschool of Art. Ruskin.\n\nThe expression is very interesting. J.W. Titian.\n\n(Keeps a macaroni store in Venice, at the old family stand.)\n\nIt is the neatest thing in still life I have seen for years.\n\nRosa Bonheur.\n\nThe smile may be almost called unique. Bismarck.\n\nI never saw such character portrayed in a picture face before. De\nMellville.\n\nThere is a benignant simplicity about the execution of this work which\nwarms the heart toward it as much, full as much, as it fascinates the\neye. Landseer.\n\nOne cannot see it without longing to contemplate the artist.\n\nFrederick William.\n\nSend me the entire edition--together with the plate and the original\nportrait--and name your own price. And--would you like to come over and\nstay awhile with Napoleon at Wilhelmshohe? It shall not cost you a cent.\nWilliam III.\n\n\n\nDOES THE RACE OF MAN LOVE A LORD?\n\nOften a quite assified remark becomes sanctified by use and petrified by\ncustom; it is then a permanency, its term of activity a geologic period.\n\nThe day after the arrival of Prince Henry I met an English friend, and\nhe rubbed his hands and broke out with a remark that was charged to the\nbrim with joy--joy that was evidently a pleasant salve to an old sore\nplace:\n\n“Many a time I've had to listen without retort to an old saying that is\nirritatingly true, and until now seemed to offer no chance for a return\njibe: 'An Englishman does dearly love a lord'; but after this I shall\ntalk back, and say, 'How about the Americans?'”\n\nIt is a curious thing, the currency that an idiotic saying can get. The\nman that first says it thinks he has made a discovery. The man he\nsays it to, thinks the same. It departs on its travels, is received\neverywhere with admiring acceptance, and not only as a piece of rare and\nacute observation, but as being exhaustively true and profoundly wise;\nand so it presently takes its place in the world's list of recognized\nand established wisdoms, and after that no one thinks of examining it to\nsee whether it is really entitled to its high honors or not. I call to\nmind instances of this in two well-established proverbs, whose dullness\nis not surpassed by the one about the Englishman and his love for a\nlord: one of them records the American's Adoration of the Almighty\nDollar, the other the American millionaire-girl's ambition to trade cash\nfor a title, with a husband thrown in.\n\nIt isn't merely the American that adores the Almighty Dollar, it is the\nhuman race. The human race has always adored the hatful of shells, or\nthe bale of calico, or the half-bushel of brass rings, or the handful of\nsteel fish-hooks, or the houseful of black wives, or the zareba full of\ncattle, or the two-score camels and asses, or the factory, or the farm,\nor the block of buildings, or the railroad bonds, or the bank stock, or\nthe hoarded cash, or--anything that stands for wealth and consideration\nand independence, and can secure to the possessor that most precious of\nall things, another man's envy. It was a dull person that invented the\nidea that the American's devotion to the dollar is more strenuous than\nanother's.\n\nRich American girls do buy titles, but they did not invent that idea;\nit had been worn threadbare several hundred centuries before America\nwas discovered. European girls still exploit it as briskly as ever;\nand, when a title is not to be had for the money in hand, they buy the\nhusband without it. They must put up the “dot,” or there is no trade.\nThe commercialization of brides is substantially universal, except in\nAmerica. It exists with us, to some little extent, but in no degree\napproaching a custom.\n\n“The Englishman dearly loves a lord.”\n\nWhat is the soul and source of this love? I think the thing could be\nmore correctly worded:\n\n“The human race dearly envies a lord.”\n\nThat is to say, it envies the lord's place. Why? On two accounts, I\nthink: its Power and its Conspicuousness.\n\nWhere Conspicuousness carries with it a Power which, by the light of our\nown observation and experience, we are able to measure and comprehend, I\nthink our envy of the possessor is as deep and as passionate as is\nthat of any other nation. No one can care less for a lord than the\nbackwoodsman, who has had no personal contact with lords and has seldom\nheard them spoken of; but I will not allow that any Englishman has a\nprofounder envy of a lord than has the average American who has lived\nlong years in a European capital and fully learned how immense is the\nposition the lord occupies.\n\nOf any ten thousand Americans who eagerly gather, at vast inconvenience,\nto get a glimpse of Prince Henry, all but a couple of hundred will be\nthere out of an immense curiosity; they are burning up with desire to\nsee a personage who is so much talked about. They envy him; but it is\nConspicuousness they envy mainly, not the Power that is lodged in his\nroyal quality and position, for they have but a vague and spectral\nknowledge and appreciation of that; through their environment and\nassociations they have been accustomed to regard such things lightly,\nand as not being very real; consequently, they are not able to value\nthem enough to consumingly envy them.\n\nBut, whenever an American (or other human being) is in the presence,\nfor the first time, of a combination of great Power and Conspicuousness\nwhich he thoroughly understands and appreciates, his eager curiosity and\npleasure will be well-sodden with that other passion--envy--whether he\nsuspects it or not. At any time, on any day, in any part of America,\nyou can confer a happiness upon any passing stranger by calling his\nattention to any other passing stranger and saying:\n\n“Do you see that gentleman going along there? It is Mr. Rockefeller.”\n\nWatch his eye. It is a combination of power and conspicuousness which\nthe man understands.\n\nWhen we understand rank, we always like to rub against it. When a man\nis conspicuous, we always want to see him. Also, if he will pay us an\nattention we will manage to remember it. Also, we will mention it now\nand then, casually; sometimes to a friend, or if a friend is not handy,\nwe will make out with a stranger.\n\nWell, then, what is rank, and what is conspicuousness? At once we\nthink of kings and aristocracies, and of world-wide celebrities in\nsoldierships, the arts, letters, etc., and we stop there. But that is a\nmistake. Rank holds its court and receives its homage on every round of\nthe ladder, from the emperor down to the rat-catcher; and distinction,\nalso, exists on every round of the ladder, and commands its due of\ndeference and envy.\n\nTo worship rank and distinction is the dear and valued privilege of all\nthe human race, and it is freely and joyfully exercised in democracies\nas well as in monarchies--and even, to some extent, among those\ncreatures whom we impertinently call the Lower Animals. For even they\nhave some poor little vanities and foibles, though in this matter they\nare paupers as compared to us.\n\nA Chinese Emperor has the worship of his four hundred millions of\nsubjects, but the rest of the world is indifferent to him. A Christian\nEmperor has the worship of his subjects and of a large part of\nthe Christian world outside of his domains; but he is a matter of\nindifference to all China. A king, class A, has an extensive worship; a\nking, class B, has a less extensive worship; class C, class D, class\nE get a steadily diminishing share of worship; class L (Sultan of\nZanzibar), class P (Sultan of Sulu), and class W (half-king of Samoa),\nget no worship at all outside their own little patch of sovereignty.\n\nTake the distinguished people along down. Each has his group of\nhomage-payers. In the navy, there are many groups; they start with the\nSecretary and the Admiral, and go down to the quartermaster--and below;\nfor there will be groups among the sailors, and each of these groups\nwill have a tar who is distinguished for his battles, or his strength,\nor his daring, or his profanity, and is admired and envied by his group.\nThe same with the army; the same with the literary and journalistic\ncraft; the publishing craft; the cod-fishery craft; Standard Oil; U. S.\nSteel; the class A hotel--and the rest of the alphabet in that line; the\nclass A prize-fighter--and the rest of the alphabet in his line--clear\ndown to the lowest and obscurest six-boy gang of little gamins, with\nits one boy that can thrash the rest, and to whom he is king of Samoa,\nbottom of the royal race, but looked up to with a most ardent admiration\nand envy.\n\nThere is something pathetic, and funny, and pretty, about this human\nrace's fondness for contact with power and distinction, and for the\nreflected glory it gets out of it. The king, class A, is happy in the\nstate banquet and the military show which the emperor provides for him,\nand he goes home and gathers the queen and the princelings around him in\nthe privacy of the spare room, and tells them all about it, and says:\n\n“His Imperial Majesty put his hand upon my shoulder in the most friendly\nway--just as friendly and familiar, oh, you can't imagine it!--and\neverybody _seeing _him do it; charming, perfectly charming!”\n\nThe king, class G, is happy in the cold collation and the police parade\nprovided for him by the king, class B, and goes home and tells the\nfamily all about it, and says:\n\n“And His Majesty took me into his own private cabinet for a smoke and a\nchat, and there we sat just as sociable, and talking away and laughing\nand chatting, just the same as if we had been born in the same bunk; and\nall the servants in the anteroom could see us doing it! Oh, it was too\nlovely for anything!”\n\nThe king, class Q, is happy in the modest entertainment furnished him by\nthe king, class M, and goes home and tells the household about it,\nand is as grateful and joyful over it as were his predecessors in the\ngaudier attentions that had fallen to their larger lot.\n\nEmperors, kings, artisans, peasants, big people, little people--at the\nbottom we are all alike and all the same; all just alike on the inside,\nand when our clothes are off, nobody can tell which of us is which. We\nare unanimous in the pride we take in good and genuine compliments paid\nus, and distinctions conferred upon us, in attentions shown. There is\nnot one of us, from the emperor down, but is made like that. Do I\nmean attentions shown us by the guest? No, I mean simply flattering\nattentions, let them come whence they may. We despise no source that can\npay us a pleasing attention--there is no source that is humble enough\nfor that. You have heard a dear little girl say to a frowzy and\ndisreputable dog: “He came right to me and let me pat him on the head,\nand he wouldn't let the others touch him!” and you have seen her eyes\ndance with pride in that high distinction. You have often seen that. If\nthe child were a princess, would that random dog be able to confer the\nlike glory upon her with his pretty compliment? Yes; and even in her\nmature life and seated upon a throne, she would still remember it, still\nrecall it, still speak of it with frank satisfaction. That charming\nand lovable German princess and poet, Carmen Sylva, Queen of Roumania,\nremembers yet that the flowers of the woods and fields “talked to her”\n when she was a girl, and she sets it down in her latest book; and that\nthe squirrels conferred upon her and her father the valued compliment of\nnot being afraid of them; and “once one of them, holding a nut between\nits sharp little teeth, ran right up against my father”--it has the very\nnote of “He came right to me and let me pat him on the head”--“and when\nit saw itself reflected in his boot it was very much surprised,\nand stopped for a long time to contemplate itself in the polished\nleather”--then it went its way. And the birds! she still remembers with\npride that “they came boldly into my room,” when she had neglected her\n“duty” and put no food on the window-sill for them; she knew all the\nwild birds, and forgets the royal crown on her head to remember with\npride that they knew her; also that the wasp and the bee were personal\nfriends of hers, and never forgot that gracious relationship to her\ninjury: “never have I been stung by a wasp or a bee.” And here is that\nproud note again that sings in that little child's elation in being\nsingled out, among all the company of children, for the random dog's\nhonor-conferring attentions. “Even in the very worst summer for wasps,\nwhen, in lunching out of doors, our table was covered with them and\nevery one else was stung, they never hurt me.”\n\nWhen a queen whose qualities of mind and heart and character are able to\nadd distinction to so distinguished a place as a throne, remembers\nwith grateful exultation, after thirty years, honors and distinctions\nconferred upon her by the humble, wild creatures of the forest, we are\nhelped to realize that complimentary attentions, homage,\ndistinctions, are of no caste, but are above all cast--that they are a\nnobility-conferring power apart.\n\nWe all like these things. When the gate-guard at the railway-station\npasses me through unchallenged and examines other people's tickets, I\nfeel as the king, class A, felt when the emperor put the imperial hand\non his shoulder, “everybody seeing him do it”; and as the child felt\nwhen the random dog allowed her to pat his head and ostracized the\nothers; and as the princess felt when the wasps spared her and stung\nthe rest; and I felt just so, four years ago in Vienna (and remember it\nyet), when the helmeted police shut me off, with fifty others, from a\nstreet which the Emperor was to pass through, and the captain of the\nsquad turned and saw the situation and said indignantly to that guard:\n\n“Can't you see it is the Herr Mark Twain? Let him through!”\n\nIt was four years ago; but it will be four hundred before I forget the\nwind of self-complacency that rose in me, and strained my buttons when I\nmarked the deference for me evoked in the faces of my fellow-rabble, and\nnoted, mingled with it, a puzzled and resentful expression which said,\nas plainly as speech could have worded it: “And who in the nation is the\nHerr Mark Twain _um gotteswillen?_”\n\nHow many times in your life have you heard this boastful remark:\n\n“I stood as close to him as I am to you; I could have put out my hand\nand touched him.”\n\nWe have all heard it many and many a time. It was a proud distinction\nto be able to say those words. It brought envy to the speaker, a kind of\nglory; and he basked in it and was happy through all his veins. And\nwho was it he stood so close to? The answer would cover all the grades.\nSometimes it was a king; sometimes it was a renowned highwayman;\nsometimes it was an unknown man killed in an extraordinary way and made\nsuddenly famous by it; always it was a person who was for the moment the\nsubject of public interest of a village.\n\n“I was there, and I saw it myself.” That is a common and envy-compelling\nremark. It can refer to a battle; to a hanging; to a coronation; to the\nkilling of Jumbo by the railway-train; to the arrival of Jenny Lind at\nthe Battery; to the meeting of the President and Prince Henry; to the\nchase of a murderous maniac; to the disaster in the tunnel; to the\nexplosion in the subway; to a remarkable dog-fight; to a village\nchurch struck by lightning. It will be said, more or less causally, by\neverybody in America who has seen Prince Henry do anything, or try to.\nThe man who was absent and didn't see him to anything, will scoff. It\nis his privilege; and he can make capital out of it, too; he will seem,\neven to himself, to be different from other Americans, and better.\nAs his opinion of his superior Americanism grows, and swells, and\nconcentrates and coagulates, he will go further and try to belittle the\ndistinction of those that saw the Prince do things, and will spoil their\npleasure in it if he can. My life has been embittered by that kind of\nperson. If you are able to tell of a special distinction that has fallen\nto your lot, it gravels them; they cannot bear it; and they try to make\nbelieve that the thing you took for a special distinction was nothing\nof the kind and was meant in quite another way. Once I was received in\nprivate audience by an emperor. Last week I was telling a jealous person\nabout it, and I could see him wince under it, see him bite, see\nhim suffer. I revealed the whole episode to him with considerable\nelaboration and nice attention to detail. When I was through, he asked\nme what had impressed me most. I said:\n\n“His Majesty's delicacy. They told me to be sure and back out from the\npresence, and find the door-knob as best I could; it was not allowable\nto face around. Now the Emperor knew it would be a difficult ordeal for\nme, because of lack of practice; and so, when it was time to part, he\nturned, with exceeding delicacy, and pretended to fumble with things on\nhis desk, so I could get out in my own way, without his seeing me.”\n\nIt went home! It was vitriol! I saw the envy and disgruntlement rise\nin the man's face; he couldn't keep it down. I saw him try to fix up\nsomething in his mind to take the bloom off that distinction. I enjoyed\nthat, for I judged that he had his work cut out for him. He struggled\nalong inwardly for quite a while; then he said, with a manner of a\nperson who has to say something and hasn't anything relevant to say:\n\n“You said he had a handful of special-brand cigars on the table?”\n\n“Yes; _I_ never saw anything to match them.”\n\nI had him again. He had to fumble around in his mind as much as another\nminute before he could play; then he said in as mean a way as I ever\nheard a person say anything:\n\n“He could have been counting the cigars, you know.”\n\nI cannot endure a man like that. It is nothing to him how unkind he is,\nso long as he takes the bloom off. It is all he cares for.\n\n“An Englishman (or other human being) does dearly love a lord,” (or\nother conspicuous person.) It includes us all. We love to be noticed by\nthe conspicuous person; we love to be associated with such, or with\na conspicuous event, even in a seventh-rate fashion, even in the\nforty-seventh, if we cannot do better. This accounts for some of our\ncurious tastes in mementos. It accounts for the large private trade in\nthe Prince of Wales's hair, which chambermaids were able to drive in\nthat article of commerce when the Prince made the tour of the world in\nthe long ago--hair which probably did not always come from his brush,\nsince enough of it was marketed to refurnish a bald comet; it accounts\nfor the fact that the rope which lynches a negro in the presence of\nten thousand Christian spectators is salable five minutes later at\ntwo dollars and inch; it accounts for the mournful fact that a royal\npersonage does not venture to wear buttons on his coat in public.\n\nWe do love a lord--and by that term I mean any person whose situation\nis higher than our own. The lord of the group, for instance: a group of\npeers, a group of millionaires, a group of hoodlums, a group of sailors,\na group of newsboys, a group of saloon politicians, a group of college\ngirls. No royal person has ever been the object of a more delirious\nloyalty and slavish adoration than is paid by the vast Tammany herd to\nits squalid idol of Wantage. There is not a bifurcated animal in that\nmenagerie that would not be proud to appear in a newspaper picture in\nhis company. At the same time, there are some in that organization who\nwould scoff at the people who have been daily pictured in company with\nPrince Henry, and would say vigorously that _they _would not consent\nto be photographed with him--a statement which would not be true in any\ninstance. There are hundreds of people in America who would frankly say\nto you that they would not be proud to be photographed in a group\nwith the Prince, if invited; and some of these unthinking people would\nbelieve it when they said it; yet in no instance would it be true. We\nhave a large population, but we have not a large enough one, by several\nmillions, to furnish that man. He has not yet been begotten, and in fact\nhe is not begettable.\n\nYou may take any of the printed groups, and there isn't a person in the\ndim background who isn't visibly trying to be vivid; if it is a crowd of\nten thousand--ten thousand proud, untamed democrats, horny-handed sons\nof toil and of politics, and fliers of the eagle--there isn't one who\nis trying to keep out of range, there isn't one who isn't plainly\nmeditating a purchase of the paper in the morning, with the intention of\nhunting himself out in the picture and of framing and keeping it if he\nshall find so much of his person in it as his starboard ear.\n\nWe all love to get some of the drippings of Conspicuousness, and we\nwill put up with a single, humble drip, if we can't get any more. We may\npretend otherwise, in conversation; but we can't pretend it to ourselves\nprivately--and we don't. We do confess in public that we are the\nnoblest work of God, being moved to it by long habit, and teaching,\nand superstition; but deep down in the secret places of our souls we\nrecognize that, if we _are _the noblest work, the less said about it the\nbetter.\n\nWe of the North poke fun at the South for its fondness of titles--a\nfondness for titles pure and simple, regardless of whether they are\ngenuine or pinchbeck. We forget that whatever a Southerner likes the\nrest of the human race likes, and that there is no law of predilection\nlodged in one people that is absent from another people. There is no\nvariety in the human race. We are all children, all children of the one\nAdam, and we love toys. We can soon acquire that Southern disease if\nsome one will give it a start. It already has a start, in fact. I have\nbeen personally acquainted with over eighty-four thousand persons who,\nat one time or another in their lives, have served for a year or two\non the staffs of our multitudinous governors, and through that\nfatality have been generals temporarily, and colonels temporarily, and\njudge-advocates temporarily; but I have known only nine among them who\ncould be hired to let the title go when it ceased to be legitimate. I\nknow thousands and thousands of governors who ceased to be governors\naway back in the last century; but I am acquainted with only three who\nwould answer your letter if you failed to call them “Governor” in it.\nI know acres and acres of men who have done time in a legislature in\nprehistoric days, but among them is not half an acre whose resentment\nyou would not raise if you addressed them as “Mr.” instead of “Hon.”\n The first thing a legislature does is to convene in an impressive\nlegislative attitude, and get itself photographed. Each member\nframes his copy and takes it to the woods and hangs it up in the most\naggressively conspicuous place in his house; and if you visit the house\nand fail to inquire what that accumulation is, the conversation will be\nbrought around to it by that aforetime legislator, and he will show you\na figure in it which in the course of years he has almost obliterated\nwith the smut of his finger-marks, and say with a solemn joy, “It's me!”\n\nHave you ever seen a country Congressman enter the hotel breakfast-room\nin Washington with his letters?--and sit at his table and let on to\nread them?--and wrinkle his brows and frown statesman-like?--keeping a\nfurtive watch-out over his glasses all the while to see if he is being\nobserved and admired?--those same old letters which he fetches in every\nmorning? Have you seen it? Have you seen him show off? It is _the_\nsight of the national capital. Except one; a pathetic one. That is the\nex-Congressman: the poor fellow whose life has been ruined by a two-year\ntaste of glory and of fictitious consequence; who has been superseded,\nand ought to take his heartbreak home and hide it, but cannot tear\nhimself away from the scene of his lost little grandeur; and so he\nlingers, and still lingers, year after year, unconsidered, sometimes\nsnubbed, ashamed of his fallen estate, and valiantly trying to look\notherwise; dreary and depressed, but counterfeiting breeziness and\ngaiety, hailing with chummy familiarity, which is not always welcomed,\nthe more-fortunates who are still in place and were once his mates. Have\nyou seen him? He clings piteously to the one little shred that is left\nof his departed distinction--the “privilege of the floor”; and works it\nhard and gets what he can out of it. That is the saddest figure I know\nof.\n\nYes, we do so love our little distinctions! And then we loftily scoff\nat a Prince for enjoying his larger ones; forgetting that if we only had\nhis chance--ah! “Senator” is not a legitimate title. A Senator has no\nmore right to be addressed by it than have you or I; but, in the several\nstate capitals and in Washington, there are five thousand Senators who\ntake very kindly to that fiction, and who purr gratefully when you call\nthem by it--which you may do quite unrebuked. Then those same Senators\nsmile at the self-constructed majors and generals and judges of the\nSouth!\n\nIndeed, we do love our distinctions, get them how we may. And we work\nthem for all they are worth. In prayer we call ourselves “worms of the\ndust,” but it is only on a sort of tacit understanding that the remark\nshall not be taken at par._ We_--worms of the dust! Oh, no, we are\nnot that. Except in fact; and we do not deal much in fact when we are\ncontemplating ourselves.\n\nAs a race, we do certainly love a lord--let him be Croker, or a duke, or\na prize-fighter, or whatever other personage shall chance to be the head\nof our group. Many years ago, I saw a greasy youth in overalls standing\nby the _Herald _office, with an expectant look in his face. Soon a large\nman passed out, and gave him a pat on the shoulder. That was what the\nboy was waiting for--the large man's notice. The pat made him proud and\nhappy, and the exultation inside of him shone out through his eyes; and\nhis mates were there to see the pat and envy it and wish they could have\nthat glory. The boy belonged down cellar in the press-room, the large\nman was king of the upper floors, foreman of the composing-room. The\nlight in the boy's face was worship, the foreman was his lord, head of\nhis group. The pat was an accolade. It was as precious to the boy as it\nwould have been if he had been an aristocrat's son and the accolade had\nbeen delivered by his sovereign with a sword. The quintessence of the\nhonor was all there; there was no difference in values; in truth there\nwas no difference present except an artificial one--clothes.\n\nAll the human race loves a lord--that is, loves to look upon or be\nnoticed by the possessor of Power or Conspicuousness; and sometimes\nanimals, born to better things and higher ideals, descend to man's level\nin this matter. In the Jardin des Plantes I have see a cat that was so\nvain of being the personal friend of an elephant that I was ashamed of\nher.\n\n\n\nEXTRACTS FROM ADAM'S DIARY\n\nMONDAY.--This new creature with the long hair is a good deal in the way.\nIt is always hanging around and following me about. I don't like this; I\nam not used to company. I wish it would stay with the other animals....\nCloudy today, wind in the east; think we shall have rain.... _We?_ Where\ndid I get that word--the new creature uses it.\n\nTUESDAY.--Been examining the great waterfall. It is the finest thing on\nthe estate, I think. The new creature calls it Niagara Falls--why, I am\nsure I do not know. Says it _looks _like Niagara Falls. That is not a\nreason, it is mere waywardness and imbecility. I get no chance to name\nanything myself. The new creature names everything that comes along,\nbefore I can get in a protest. And always that same pretext is\noffered--it _looks _like the thing. There is a dodo, for instance. Says\nthe moment one looks at it one sees at a glance that it “looks like a\ndodo.” It will have to keep that name, no doubt. It wearies me to fret\nabout it, and it does no good, anyway. Dodo! It looks no more like a\ndodo than I do.\n\nWEDNESDAY.--Built me a shelter against the rain, but could not have it\nto myself in peace. The new creature intruded. When I tried to put it\nout it shed water out of the holes it looks with, and wiped it away with\nthe back of its paws, and made a noise such as some of the other animals\nmake when they are in distress. I wish it would not talk; it is always\ntalking. That sounds like a cheap fling at the poor creature, a slur;\nbut I do not mean it so. I have never heard the human voice before, and\nany new and strange sound intruding itself here upon the solemn hush of\nthese dreaming solitudes offends my ear and seems a false note. And this\nnew sound is so close to me; it is right at my shoulder, right at my\near, first on one side and then on the other, and I am used only to\nsounds that are more or less distant from me.\n\nFRIDAY. The naming goes recklessly on, in spite of anything I can do.\nI had a very good name for the estate, and it was musical and\npretty--_Garden Of Eden._ Privately, I continue to call it that, but not\nany longer publicly. The new creature says it is all woods and rocks and\nscenery, and therefore has no resemblance to a garden. Says it\n_looks _like a park, and does not look like anything _but _a park.\nConsequently, without consulting me, it has been new-named _Niagara\nFalls Park_. This is sufficiently high-handed, it seems to me. And\nalready there is a sign up:\n\nKEEP OFF THE GRASS\n\nMy life is not as happy as it was.\n\nSATURDAY.--The new creature eats too much fruit. We are going to run\nshort, most likely. “We” again--that is _its_ word; mine, too, now, from\nhearing it so much. Good deal of fog this morning. I do not go out in\nthe fog myself. This new creature does. It goes out in all weathers,\nand stumps right in with its muddy feet. And talks. It used to be so\npleasant and quiet here.\n\nSUNDAY.--Pulled through. This day is getting to be more and more trying.\nIt was selected and set apart last November as a day of rest. I had\nalready six of them per week before. This morning found the new creature\ntrying to clod apples out of that forbidden tree.\n\nMONDAY.--The new creature says its name is Eve. That is all right, I\nhave no objections. Says it is to call it by, when I want it to come.\nI said it was superfluous, then. The word evidently raised me in its\nrespect; and indeed it is a large, good word and will bear repetition.\nIt says it is not an It, it is a She. This is probably doubtful; yet it\nis all one to me; what she is were nothing to me if she would but go by\nherself and not talk.\n\nTUESDAY.--She has littered the whole estate with execrable names and\noffensive signs:\n\nThis way to the Whirlpool\n\nThis way to Goat Island\n\nCave of the Winds this way\n\nShe says this park would make a tidy summer resort if there was any\ncustom for it. Summer resort--another invention of hers--just words,\nwithout any meaning. What is a summer resort? But it is best not to ask\nher, she has such a rage for explaining.\n\nFRIDAY.--She has taken to beseeching me to stop going over the Falls.\nWhat harm does it do? Says it makes her shudder. I wonder why; I have\nalways done it--always liked the plunge, and coolness. I supposed it was\nwhat the Falls were for. They have no other use that I can see, and\nthey must have been made for something. She says they were only made for\nscenery--like the rhinoceros and the mastodon.\n\nI went over the Falls in a barrel--not satisfactory to her. Went over\nin a tub--still not satisfactory. Swam the Whirlpool and the Rapids in\na fig-leaf suit. It got much damaged. Hence, tedious complaints about\nmy extravagance. I am too much hampered here. What I need is a change of\nscene.\n\nSATURDAY.--I escaped last Tuesday night, and traveled two days, and\nbuilt me another shelter in a secluded place, and obliterated my tracks\nas well as I could, but she hunted me out by means of a beast which she\nhas tamed and calls a wolf, and came making that pitiful noise again,\nand shedding that water out of the places she looks with. I was obliged\nto return with her, but will presently emigrate again when occasion\noffers. She engages herself in many foolish things; among others; to\nstudy out why the animals called lions and tigers live on grass and\nflowers, when, as she says, the sort of teeth they wear would indicate\nthat they were intended to eat each other. This is foolish, because to\ndo that would be to kill each other, and that would introduce what, as\nI understand, is called “death”; and death, as I have been told, has not\nyet entered the Park. Which is a pity, on some accounts.\n\nSUNDAY.--Pulled through.\n\nMONDAY.--I believe I see what the week is for: it is to give time to\nrest up from the weariness of Sunday. It seems a good idea. ... She has\nbeen climbing that tree again. Clodded her out of it. She said nobody\nwas looking. Seems to consider that a sufficient justification for\nchancing any dangerous thing. Told her that. The word justification\nmoved her admiration--and envy, too, I thought. It is a good word.\n\nTUESDAY.--She told me she was made out of a rib taken from my body.\nThis is at least doubtful, if not more than that. I have not missed any\nrib.... She is in much trouble about the buzzard; says grass does not\nagree with it; is afraid she can't raise it; thinks it was intended to\nlive on decayed flesh. The buzzard must get along the best it can with\nwhat is provided. We cannot overturn the whole scheme to accommodate the\nbuzzard.\n\nSATURDAY.--She fell in the pond yesterday when she was looking at\nherself in it, which she is always doing. She nearly strangled, and said\nit was most uncomfortable. This made her sorry for the creatures which\nlive in there, which she calls fish, for she continues to fasten names\non to things that don't need them and don't come when they are called\nby them, which is a matter of no consequence to her, she is such a\nnumbskull, anyway; so she got a lot of them out and brought them in last\nnight and put them in my bed to keep warm, but I have noticed them now\nand then all day and I don't see that they are any happier there then\nthey were before, only quieter. When night comes I shall throw them\noutdoors. I will not sleep with them again, for I find them clammy and\nunpleasant to lie among when a person hasn't anything on.\n\nSUNDAY.--Pulled through.\n\nTUESDAY.--She has taken up with a snake now. The other animals are glad,\nfor she was always experimenting with them and bothering them; and I am\nglad because the snake talks, and this enables me to get a rest.\n\nFRIDAY.--She says the snake advises her to try the fruit of the tree,\nand says the result will be a great and fine and noble education. I told\nher there would be another result, too--it would introduce death into\nthe world. That was a mistake--it had been better to keep the remark to\nmyself; it only gave her an idea--she could save the sick buzzard, and\nfurnish fresh meat to the despondent lions and tigers. I advised her to\nkeep away from the tree. She said she wouldn't. I foresee trouble. Will\nemigrate.\n\nWEDNESDAY.--I have had a variegated time. I escaped last night, and rode\na horse all night as fast as he could go, hoping to get clear of the\nPark and hide in some other country before the trouble should begin; but\nit was not to be. About an hour after sun-up, as I was riding through\na flowery plain where thousands of animals were grazing, slumbering, or\nplaying with each other, according to their wont, all of a sudden they\nbroke into a tempest of frightful noises, and in one moment the plain\nwas a frantic commotion and every beast was destroying its neighbor. I\nknew what it meant--Eve had eaten that fruit, and death was come into\nthe world. ... The tigers ate my house, paying no attention when\nI ordered them to desist, and they would have eaten me if I had\nstayed--which I didn't, but went away in much haste.... I found this\nplace, outside the Park, and was fairly comfortable for a few days,\nbut she has found me out. Found me out, and has named the place\nTonawanda--says it _looks _like that. In fact I was not sorry she came,\nfor there are but meager pickings here, and she brought some of those\napples. I was obliged to eat them, I was so hungry. It was against my\nprinciples, but I find that principles have no real force except when\none is well fed.... She came curtained in boughs and bunches of leaves,\nand when I asked her what she meant by such nonsense, and snatched them\naway and threw them down, she tittered and blushed. I had never seen\na person titter and blush before, and to me it seemed unbecoming and\nidiotic. She said I would soon know how it was myself. This was correct.\nHungry as I was, I laid down the apple half-eaten--certainly the best\none I ever saw, considering the lateness of the season--and arrayed\nmyself in the discarded boughs and branches, and then spoke to her with\nsome severity and ordered her to go and get some more and not make a\nspectacle of herself. She did it, and after this we crept down to where\nthe wild-beast battle had been, and collected some skins, and I made her\npatch together a couple of suits proper for public occasions. They are\nuncomfortable, it is true, but stylish, and that is the main point about\nclothes.... I find she is a good deal of a companion. I see I should be\nlonesome and depressed without her, now that I have lost my property.\nAnother thing, she says it is ordered that we work for our living\nhereafter. She will be useful. I will superintend.\n\nTEN DAYS LATER.--She accuses _me _of being the cause of our disaster!\nShe says, with apparent sincerity and truth, that the Serpent assured\nher that the forbidden fruit was not apples, it was chestnuts. I said\nI was innocent, then, for I had not eaten any chestnuts. She said the\nSerpent informed her that “chestnut” was a figurative term meaning an\naged and moldy joke. I turned pale at that, for I have made many jokes\nto pass the weary time, and some of them could have been of that sort,\nthough I had honestly supposed that they were new when I made them. She\nasked me if I had made one just at the time of the catastrophe. I was\nobliged to admit that I had made one to myself, though not aloud. It\nwas this. I was thinking about the Falls, and I said to myself, “How\nwonderful it is to see that vast body of water tumble down there!” Then\nin an instant a bright thought flashed into my head, and I let it\nfly, saying, “It would be a deal more wonderful to see it tumble_ up_\nthere!”--and I was just about to kill myself with laughing at it when\nall nature broke loose in war and death and I had to flee for my life.\n“There,” she said, with triumph, “that is just it; the Serpent mentioned\nthat very jest, and called it the First Chestnut, and said it was coeval\nwith the creation.” Alas, I am indeed to blame. Would that I were not\nwitty; oh, that I had never had that radiant thought!\n\nNEXT YEAR.--We have named it Cain. She caught it while I was up country\ntrapping on the North Shore of the Erie; caught it in the timber a\ncouple of miles from our dug-out--or it might have been four, she isn't\ncertain which. It resembles us in some ways, and may be a relation. That\nis what she thinks, but this is an error, in my judgment. The difference\nin size warrants the conclusion that it is a different and new kind of\nanimal--a fish, perhaps, though when I put it in the water to see,\nit sank, and she plunged in and snatched it out before there was\nopportunity for the experiment to determine the matter. I still think it\nis a fish, but she is indifferent about what it is, and will not let\nme have it to try. I do not understand this. The coming of the creature\nseems to have changed her whole nature and made her unreasonable about\nexperiments. She thinks more of it than she does of any of the\nother animals, but is not able to explain why. Her mind is\ndisordered--everything shows it. Sometimes she carries the fish in her\narms half the night when it complains and wants to get to the water. At\nsuch times the water comes out of the places in her face that she looks\nout of, and she pats the fish on the back and makes soft sounds with her\nmouth to soothe it, and betrays sorrow and solicitude in a hundred ways.\nI have never seen her do like this with any other fish, and it troubles\nme greatly. She used to carry the young tigers around so, and play with\nthem, before we lost our property, but it was only play; she never took\non about them like this when their dinner disagreed with them.\n\nSUNDAY.--She doesn't work, Sundays, but lies around all tired out, and\nlikes to have the fish wallow over her; and she makes fool noises to\namuse it, and pretends to chew its paws, and that makes it laugh. I have\nnot seen a fish before that could laugh. This makes me doubt.... I have\ncome to like Sunday myself. Superintending all the week tires a body so.\nThere ought to be more Sundays. In the old days they were tough, but now\nthey come handy.\n\nWEDNESDAY.--It isn't a fish. I cannot quite make out what it is. It\nmakes curious devilish noises when not satisfied, and says “goo-goo”\n when it is. It is not one of us, for it doesn't walk; it is not a bird,\nfor it doesn't fly; it is not a frog, for it doesn't hop; it is not\na snake, for it doesn't crawl; I feel sure it is not a fish, though I\ncannot get a chance to find out whether it can swim or not. It merely\nlies around, and mostly on its back, with its feet up. I have not seen\nany other animal do that before. I said I believed it was an enigma; but\nshe only admired the word without understanding it. In my judgment it is\neither an enigma or some kind of a bug. If it dies, I will take it apart\nand see what its arrangements are. I never had a thing perplex me so.\n\nTHREE MONTHS LATER.--The perplexity augments instead of diminishing. I\nsleep but little. It has ceased from lying around, and goes about on\nits four legs now. Yet it differs from the other four legged animals,\nin that its front legs are unusually short, consequently this causes the\nmain part of its person to stick up uncomfortably high in the air, and\nthis is not attractive. It is built much as we are, but its method of\ntraveling shows that it is not of our breed. The short front legs and\nlong hind ones indicate that it is a of the kangaroo family, but it is a\nmarked variation of that species, since the true kangaroo hops, whereas\nthis one never does. Still it is a curious and interesting variety,\nand has not been catalogued before. As I discovered it, I have felt\njustified in securing the credit of the discovery by attaching my name\nto it, and hence have called it _Kangaroorum Adamiensis_.... It must\nhave been a young one when it came, for it has grown exceedingly since.\nIt must be five times as big, now, as it was then, and when discontented\nit is able to make from twenty-two to thirty-eight times the noise\nit made at first. Coercion does not modify this, but has the contrary\neffect. For this reason I discontinued the system. She reconciles it by\npersuasion, and by giving it things which she had previously told me she\nwouldn't give it. As already observed, I was not at home when it first\ncame, and she told me she found it in the woods. It seems odd that it\nshould be the only one, yet it must be so, for I have worn myself out\nthese many weeks trying to find another one to add to my collection, and\nfor this to play with; for surely then it would be quieter and we\ncould tame it more easily. But I find none, nor any vestige of any; and\nstrangest of all, no tracks. It has to live on the ground, it cannot\nhelp itself; therefore, how does it get about without leaving a track?\nI have set a dozen traps, but they do no good. I catch all small animals\nexcept that one; animals that merely go into the trap out of curiosity,\nI think, to see what the milk is there for. They never drink it.\n\nTHREE MONTHS LATER.--The Kangaroo still continues to grow, which is\nvery strange and perplexing. I never knew one to be so long getting its\ngrowth. It has fur on its head now; not like kangaroo fur, but exactly\nlike our hair except that it is much finer and softer, and instead of\nbeing black is red. I am like to lose my mind over the capricious and\nharassing developments of this unclassifiable zoological freak. If I\ncould catch another one--but that is hopeless; it is a new variety, and\nthe only sample; this is plain. But I caught a true kangaroo and brought\nit in, thinking that this one, being lonesome, would rather have that\nfor company than have no kin at all, or any animal it could feel a\nnearness to or get sympathy from in its forlorn condition here among\nstrangers who do not know its ways or habits, or what to do to make it\nfeel that it is among friends; but it was a mistake--it went into such\nfits at the sight of the kangaroo that I was convinced it had never seen\none before. I pity the poor noisy little animal, but there is nothing\nI can do to make it happy. If I could tame it--but that is out of the\nquestion; the more I try the worse I seem to make it. It grieves me to\nthe heart to see it in its little storms of sorrow and passion. I wanted\nto let it go, but she wouldn't hear of it. That seemed cruel and not\nlike her; and yet she may be right. It might be lonelier than ever; for\nsince I cannot find another one, how could_ it_?\n\nFIVE MONTHS LATER.--It is not a kangaroo. No, for it supports itself by\nholding to her finger, and thus goes a few steps on its hind legs, and\nthen falls down. It is probably some kind of a bear; and yet it has\nno tail--as yet--and no fur, except upon its head. It still keeps on\ngrowing--that is a curious circumstance, for bears get their growth\nearlier than this. Bears are dangerous--since our catastrophe--and I\nshall not be satisfied to have this one prowling about the place much\nlonger without a muzzle on. I have offered to get her a kangaroo if she\nwould let this one go, but it did no good--she is determined to run us\ninto all sorts of foolish risks, I think. She was not like this before\nshe lost her mind.\n\nA FORTNIGHT LATER.--I examined its mouth. There is no danger yet: it has\nonly one tooth. It has no tail yet. It makes more noise now than it ever\ndid before--and mainly at night. I have moved out. But I shall go over,\nmornings, to breakfast, and see if it has more teeth. If it gets a\nmouthful of teeth it will be time for it to go, tail or no tail, for a\nbear does not need a tail in order to be dangerous.\n\nFOUR MONTHS LATER.--I have been off hunting and fishing a month, up\nin the region that she calls Buffalo; I don't know why, unless it is\nbecause there are not any buffaloes there. Meantime the bear has learned\nto paddle around all by itself on its hind legs, and says “poppa” and\n“momma.” It is certainly a new species. This resemblance to words may\nbe purely accidental, of course, and may have no purpose or meaning;\nbut even in that case it is still extraordinary, and is a thing which no\nother bear can do. This imitation of speech, taken together with general\nabsence of fur and entire absence of tail, sufficiently indicates that\nthis is a new kind of bear. The further study of it will be exceedingly\ninteresting. Meantime I will go off on a far expedition among the\nforests of the north and make an exhaustive search. There must certainly\nbe another one somewhere, and this one will be less dangerous when it\nhas company of its own species. I will go straightway; but I will muzzle\nthis one first.\n\nTHREE MONTHS LATER.--It has been a weary, weary hunt, yet I have had no\nsuccess. In the mean time, without stirring from the home estate, she\nhas caught another one! I never saw such luck. I might have hunted these\nwoods a hundred years, I never would have run across that thing.\n\nNEXT DAY.--I have been comparing the new one with the old one, and it\nis perfectly plain that they are of the same breed. I was going to stuff\none of them for my collection, but she is prejudiced against it for some\nreason or other; so I have relinquished the idea, though I think it is\na mistake. It would be an irreparable loss to science if they should\nget away. The old one is tamer than it was and can laugh and talk like\na parrot, having learned this, no doubt, from being with the parrot so\nmuch, and having the imitative faculty in a high developed degree. I\nshall be astonished if it turns out to be a new kind of parrot; and yet\nI ought not to be astonished, for it has already been everything else it\ncould think of since those first days when it was a fish. The new one is\nas ugly as the old one was at first; has the same sulphur-and-raw-meat\ncomplexion and the same singular head without any fur on it. She calls\nit Abel.\n\nTEN YEARS LATER.--They are _boys_; we found it out long ago. It was\ntheir coming in that small immature shape that puzzled us; we were not\nused to it. There are some girls now. Abel is a good boy, but if Cain\nhad stayed a bear it would have improved him. After all these years, I\nsee that I was mistaken about Eve in the beginning; it is better to\nlive outside the Garden with her than inside it without her. At first\nI thought she talked too much; but now I should be sorry to have that\nvoice fall silent and pass out of my life. Blessed be the chestnut that\nbrought us near together and taught me to know the goodness of her heart\nand the sweetness of her spirit!\n\n\n\nEVE'S DIARY\n\nTranslated from the Original\n\nSATURDAY.--I am almost a whole day old, now. I arrived yesterday.\nThat is as it seems to me. And it must be so, for if there was a\nday-before-yesterday I was not there when it happened, or I should\nremember it. It could be, of course, that it did happen, and that I\nwas not noticing. Very well; I will be very watchful now, and if any\nday-before-yesterdays happen I will make a note of it. It will be best\nto start right and not let the record get confused, for some instinct\ntells me that these details are going to be important to the historian\nsome day. For I feel like an experiment, I feel exactly like an\nexperiment; it would be impossible for a person to feel more like an\nexperiment than I do, and so I am coming to feel convinced that that is\nwhat I _am_--an experiment; just an experiment, and nothing more.\n\nThen if I am an experiment, am I the whole of it? No, I think not; I\nthink the rest of it is part of it. I am the main part of it, but\nI think the rest of it has its share in the matter. Is my position\nassured, or do I have to watch it and take care of it? The latter,\nperhaps. Some instinct tells me that eternal vigilance is the price of\nsupremacy. (That is a good phrase, I think, for one so young.)\n\nEverything looks better today than it did yesterday. In the rush of\nfinishing up yesterday, the mountains were left in a ragged condition,\nand some of the plains were so cluttered with rubbish and remnants that\nthe aspects were quite distressing. Noble and beautiful works of art\nshould not be subjected to haste; and this majestic new world is indeed\na most noble and beautiful work. And certainly marvelously near to being\nperfect, notwithstanding the shortness of the time. There are too many\nstars in some places and not enough in others, but that can be remedied\npresently, no doubt. The moon got loose last night, and slid down and\nfell out of the scheme--a very great loss; it breaks my heart to think\nof it. There isn't another thing among the ornaments and decorations\nthat is comparable to it for beauty and finish. It should have been\nfastened better. If we can only get it back again--\n\nBut of course there is no telling where it went to. And besides, whoever\ngets it will hide it; I know it because I would do it myself. I believe\nI can be honest in all other matters, but I already begin to realize\nthat the core and center of my nature is love of the beautiful, a\npassion for the beautiful, and that it would not be safe to trust me\nwith a moon that belonged to another person and that person didn't know\nI had it. I could give up a moon that I found in the daytime, because I\nshould be afraid some one was looking; but if I found it in the dark,\nI am sure I should find some kind of an excuse for not saying anything\nabout it. For I do love moons, they are so pretty and so romantic. I\nwish we had five or six; I would never go to bed; I should never get\ntired lying on the moss-bank and looking up at them.\n\nStars are good, too. I wish I could get some to put in my hair. But I\nsuppose I never can. You would be surprised to find how far off they\nare, for they do not look it. When they first showed, last night,\nI tried to knock some down with a pole, but it didn't reach, which\nastonished me; then I tried clods till I was all tired out, but I never\ngot one. It was because I am left-handed and cannot throw good. Even\nwhen I aimed at the one I wasn't after I couldn't hit the other one,\nthough I did make some close shots, for I saw the black blot of the clod\nsail right into the midst of the golden clusters forty or fifty times,\njust barely missing them, and if I could have held out a little longer\nmaybe I could have got one.\n\nSo I cried a little, which was natural, I suppose, for one of my age,\nand after I was rested I got a basket and started for a place on the\nextreme rim of the circle, where the stars were close to the ground and\nI could get them with my hands, which would be better, anyway, because I\ncould gather them tenderly then, and not break them. But it was farther\nthan I thought, and at last I had to give it up; I was so tired I\ncouldn't drag my feet another step; and besides, they were sore and hurt\nme very much.\n\nI couldn't get back home; it was too far and turning cold; but I found\nsome tigers and nestled in among them and was most adorably comfortable,\nand their breath was sweet and pleasant, because they live on\nstrawberries. I had never seen a tiger before, but I knew them in a\nminute by the stripes. If I could have one of those skins, it would make\na lovely gown.\n\nToday I am getting better ideas about distances. I was so eager to get\nhold of every pretty thing that I giddily grabbed for it, sometimes when\nit was too far off, and sometimes when it was but six inches away but\nseemed a foot--alas, with thorns between! I learned a lesson; also I\nmade an axiom, all out of my own head--my very first one; _The scratched\nexperiment shuns the thorn_. I think it is a very good one for one so\nyoung.\n\nI followed the other Experiment around, yesterday afternoon, at a\ndistance, to see what it might be for, if I could. But I was not able\nto make out. I think it is a man. I had never seen a man, but it looked\nlike one, and I feel sure that that is what it is. I realize that I feel\nmore curiosity about it than about any of the other reptiles. If it is a\nreptile, and I suppose it is; for it has frowzy hair and blue eyes, and\nlooks like a reptile. It has no hips; it tapers like a carrot; when\nit stands, it spreads itself apart like a derrick; so I think it is a\nreptile, though it may be architecture.\n\nI was afraid of it at first, and started to run every time it turned\naround, for I thought it was going to chase me; but by and by I found it\nwas only trying to get away, so after that I was not timid any more, but\ntracked it along, several hours, about twenty yards behind, which made\nit nervous and unhappy. At last it was a good deal worried, and climbed\na tree. I waited a good while, then gave it up and went home.\n\nToday the same thing over. I've got it up the tree again.\n\nSUNDAY.--It is up there yet. Resting, apparently. But that is a\nsubterfuge: Sunday isn't the day of rest; Saturday is appointed for\nthat. It looks to me like a creature that is more interested in resting\nthan in anything else. It would tire me to rest so much. It tires me\njust to sit around and watch the tree. I do wonder what it is for; I\nnever see it do anything.\n\nThey returned the moon last night, and I was_ so_ happy! I think it\nis very honest of them. It slid down and fell off again, but I was\nnot distressed; there is no need to worry when one has that kind of\nneighbors; they will fetch it back. I wish I could do something to show\nmy appreciation. I would like to send them some stars, for we have more\nthan we can use. I mean I, not we, for I can see that the reptile cares\nnothing for such things.\n\nIt has low tastes, and is not kind. When I went there yesterday evening\nin the gloaming it had crept down and was trying to catch the little\nspeckled fishes that play in the pool, and I had to clod it to make it\ngo up the tree again and let them alone. I wonder if _that _is what it\nis for? Hasn't it any heart? Hasn't it any compassion for those little\ncreature? Can it be that it was designed and manufactured for such\nungentle work? It has the look of it. One of the clods took it back of\nthe ear, and it used language. It gave me a thrill, for it was the first\ntime I had ever heard speech, except my own. I did not understand the\nwords, but they seemed expressive.\n\nWhen I found it could talk I felt a new interest in it, for I love to\ntalk; I talk, all day, and in my sleep, too, and I am very interesting,\nbut if I had another to talk to I could be twice as interesting, and\nwould never stop, if desired.\n\nIf this reptile is a man, it isn't an_ it_, is it? That wouldn't be\ngrammatical, would it? I think it would be _he_. I think so. In\nthat case one would parse it thus: nominative, _he_; dative, _him_;\npossessive, _his'n._ Well, I will consider it a man and call it he until\nit turns out to be something else. This will be handier than having so\nmany uncertainties.\n\nNEXT WEEK SUNDAY.--All the week I tagged around after him and tried\nto get acquainted. I had to do the talking, because he was shy, but\nI didn't mind it. He seemed pleased to have me around, and I used\nthe sociable “we” a good deal, because it seemed to flatter him to be\nincluded.\n\nWEDNESDAY.--We are getting along very well indeed, now, and getting\nbetter and better acquainted. He does not try to avoid me any more,\nwhich is a good sign, and shows that he likes to have me with him. That\npleases me, and I study to be useful to him in every way I can, so as\nto increase his regard. During the last day or two I have taken all the\nwork of naming things off his hands, and this has been a great relief to\nhim, for he has no gift in that line, and is evidently very grateful.\nHe can't think of a rational name to save him, but I do not let him see\nthat I am aware of his defect. Whenever a new creature comes along I\nname it before he has time to expose himself by an awkward silence. In\nthis way I have saved him many embarrassments. I have no defect like\nthis. The minute I set eyes on an animal I know what it is. I don't have\nto reflect a moment; the right name comes out instantly, just as if it\nwere an inspiration, as no doubt it is, for I am sure it wasn't in me\nhalf a minute before. I seem to know just by the shape of the creature\nand the way it acts what animal it is.\n\nWhen the dodo came along he thought it was a wildcat--I saw it in his\neye. But I saved him. And I was careful not to do it in a way that\ncould hurt his pride. I just spoke up in a quite natural way of pleased\nsurprise, and not as if I was dreaming of conveying information,\nand said, “Well, I do declare, if there isn't the dodo!” I\nexplained--without seeming to be explaining--how I know it for a dodo,\nand although I thought maybe he was a little piqued that I knew the\ncreature when he didn't, it was quite evident that he admired me.\nThat was very agreeable, and I thought of it more than once with\ngratification before I slept. How little a thing can make us happy when\nwe feel that we have earned it!\n\nTHURSDAY.--my first sorrow. Yesterday he avoided me and seemed to wish\nI would not talk to him. I could not believe it, and thought there was\nsome mistake, for I loved to be with him, and loved to hear him talk,\nand so how could it be that he could feel unkind toward me when I had\nnot done anything? But at last it seemed true, so I went away and sat\nlonely in the place where I first saw him the morning that we were made\nand I did not know what he was and was indifferent about him; but now it\nwas a mournful place, and every little thing spoke of him, and my\nheart was very sore. I did not know why very clearly, for it was a new\nfeeling; I had not experienced it before, and it was all a mystery, and\nI could not make it out.\n\nBut when night came I could not bear the lonesomeness, and went to the\nnew shelter which he has built, to ask him what I had done that was\nwrong and how I could mend it and get back his kindness again; but he\nput me out in the rain, and it was my first sorrow.\n\nSUNDAY.--It is pleasant again, now, and I am happy; but those were heavy\ndays; I do not think of them when I can help it.\n\nI tried to get him some of those apples, but I cannot learn to throw\nstraight. I failed, but I think the good intention pleased him. They\nare forbidden, and he says I shall come to harm; but so I come to harm\nthrough pleasing him, why shall I care for that harm?\n\nMONDAY.--This morning I told him my name, hoping it would interest him.\nBut he did not care for it. It is strange. If he should tell me his\nname, I would care. I think it would be pleasanter in my ears than any\nother sound.\n\nHe talks very little. Perhaps it is because he is not bright, and is\nsensitive about it and wishes to conceal it. It is such a pity that he\nshould feel so, for brightness is nothing; it is in the heart that the\nvalues lie. I wish I could make him understand that a loving good heart\nis riches, and riches enough, and that without it intellect is poverty.\n\nAlthough he talks so little, he has quite a considerable vocabulary.\nThis morning he used a surprisingly good word. He evidently recognized,\nhimself, that it was a good one, for he worked it in twice afterward,\ncasually. It was not good casual art, still it showed that he possesses\na certain quality of perception. Without a doubt that seed can be made\nto grow, if cultivated.\n\nWhere did he get that word? I do not think I have ever used it.\n\nNo, he took no interest in my name. I tried to hide my disappointment,\nbut I suppose I did not succeed. I went away and sat on the moss-bank\nwith my feet in the water. It is where I go when I hunger for\ncompanionship, some one to look at, some one to talk to. It is not\nenough--that lovely white body painted there in the pool--but it is\nsomething, and something is better than utter loneliness. It talks when\nI talk; it is sad when I am sad; it comforts me with its sympathy; it\nsays, “Do not be downhearted, you poor friendless girl; I will be your\nfriend.” It_ is_ a good friend to me, and my only one; it is my sister.\n\nThat first time that she forsook me! ah, I shall never forget\nthat--never, never. My heart was lead in my body! I said, “She was all\nI had, and now she is gone!” In my despair I said, “Break, my heart; I\ncannot bear my life any more!” and hid my face in my hands, and there\nwas no solace for me. And when I took them away, after a little, there\nshe was again, white and shining and beautiful, and I sprang into her\narms!\n\nThat was perfect happiness; I had known happiness before, but it was not\nlike this, which was ecstasy. I never doubted her afterward. Sometimes\nshe stayed away--maybe an hour, maybe almost the whole day, but I waited\nand did not doubt; I said, “She is busy, or she is gone on a journey,\nbut she will come.” And it was so: she always did. At night she would\nnot come if it was dark, for she was a timid little thing; but if there\nwas a moon she would come. I am not afraid of the dark, but she is\nyounger than I am; she was born after I was. Many and many are the\nvisits I have paid her; she is my comfort and my refuge when my life is\nhard--and it is mainly that.\n\nTUESDAY.--All the morning I was at work improving the estate; and I\npurposely kept away from him in the hope that he would get lonely and\ncome. But he did not.\n\nAt noon I stopped for the day and took my recreation by flitting all\nabout with the bees and the butterflies and reveling in the flowers,\nthose beautiful creatures that catch the smile of God out of the sky and\npreserve it! I gathered them, and made them into wreaths and garlands\nand clothed myself in them while I ate my luncheon--apples, of course;\nthen I sat in the shade and wished and waited. But he did not come.\n\nBut no matter. Nothing would have come of it, for he does not care for\nflowers. He called them rubbish, and cannot tell one from another, and\nthinks it is superior to feel like that. He does not care for me, he\ndoes not care for flowers, he does not care for the painted sky at\neventide--is there anything he does care for, except building shacks to\ncoop himself up in from the good clean rain, and thumping the melons,\nand sampling the grapes, and fingering the fruit on the trees, to see\nhow those properties are coming along?\n\nI laid a dry stick on the ground and tried to bore a hole in it with\nanother one, in order to carry out a scheme that I had, and soon I got\nan awful fright. A thin, transparent bluish film rose out of the hole,\nand I dropped everything and ran! I thought it was a spirit, and I _was\n_so frightened! But I looked back, and it was not coming; so I leaned\nagainst a rock and rested and panted, and let my limbs go on trembling\nuntil they got steady again; then I crept warily back, alert, watching,\nand ready to fly if there was occasion; and when I was come near, I\nparted the branches of a rose-bush and peeped through--wishing the man\nwas about, I was looking so cunning and pretty--but the sprite was gone.\nI went there, and there was a pinch of delicate pink dust in the hole. I\nput my finger in, to feel it, and said _ouch_! and took it out again. It\nwas a cruel pain. I put my finger in my mouth; and by standing first on\none foot and then the other, and grunting, I presently eased my misery;\nthen I was full of interest, and began to examine.\n\nI was curious to know what the pink dust was. Suddenly the name of it\noccurred to me, though I had never heard of it before. It was _fire_! I\nwas as certain of it as a person could be of anything in the world. So\nwithout hesitation I named it that--fire.\n\nI had created something that didn't exist before; I had added a new\nthing to the world's uncountable properties; I realized this, and was\nproud of my achievement, and was going to run and find him and tell him\nabout it, thinking to raise myself in his esteem--but I reflected, and\ndid not do it. No--he would not care for it. He would ask what it\nwas good for, and what could I answer? for if it was not _good _for\nsomething, but only beautiful, merely beautiful-- So I sighed, and did\nnot go. For it wasn't good for anything; it could not build a shack,\nit could not improve melons, it could not hurry a fruit crop; it was\nuseless, it was a foolishness and a vanity; he would despise it and say\ncutting words. But to me it was not despicable; I said, “Oh, you fire, I\nlove you, you dainty pink creature, for you are _beautiful_--and that is\nenough!” and was going to gather it to my breast. But refrained. Then\nI made another maxim out of my head, though it was so nearly like\nthe first one that I was afraid it was only a plagiarism: “_The burnt\nexperiment shuns the fire_.”\n\nI wrought again; and when I had made a good deal of fire-dust I emptied\nit into a handful of dry brown grass, intending to carry it home and\nkeep it always and play with it; but the wind struck it and it sprayed\nup and spat out at me fiercely, and I dropped it and ran. When I looked\nback the blue spirit was towering up and stretching and rolling away\nlike a cloud, and instantly I thought of the name of it--smoke!--though,\nupon my word, I had never heard of smoke before.\n\nSoon brilliant yellow and red flares shot up through the smoke, and I\nnamed them in an instant--flames--and I was right, too, though these\nwere the very first flames that had ever been in the world. They climbed\nthe trees, then flashed splendidly in and out of the vast and increasing\nvolume of tumbling smoke, and I had to clap my hands and laugh and\ndance in my rapture, it was so new and strange and so wonderful and so\nbeautiful!\n\nHe came running, and stopped and gazed, and said not a word for many\nminutes. Then he asked what it was. Ah, it was too bad that he should\nask such a direct question. I had to answer it, of course, and I did. I\nsaid it was fire. If it annoyed him that I should know and he must ask;\nthat was not my fault; I had no desire to annoy him. After a pause he\nasked:\n\n“How did it come?”\n\nAnother direct question, and it also had to have a direct answer.\n\n“I made it.”\n\nThe fire was traveling farther and farther off. He went to the edge of\nthe burned place and stood looking down, and said:\n\n“What are these?”\n\n“Fire-coals.”\n\nHe picked up one to examine it, but changed his mind and put it down\nagain. Then he went away. _Nothing _interests him.\n\nBut I was interested. There were ashes, gray and soft and delicate\nand pretty--I knew what they were at once. And the embers; I knew the\nembers, too. I found my apples, and raked them out, and was glad; for\nI am very young and my appetite is active. But I was disappointed; they\nwere all burst open and spoiled. Spoiled apparently; but it was not so;\nthey were better than raw ones. Fire is beautiful; some day it will be\nuseful, I think.\n\nFRIDAY.--I saw him again, for a moment, last Monday at nightfall, but\nonly for a moment. I was hoping he would praise me for trying to improve\nthe estate, for I had meant well and had worked hard. But he was not\npleased, and turned away and left me. He was also displeased on another\naccount: I tried once more to persuade him to stop going over the Falls.\nThat was because the fire had revealed to me a new passion--quite new,\nand distinctly different from love, grief, and those others which I\nhad already discovered--fear. And it is horrible!--I wish I had never\ndiscovered it; it gives me dark moments, it spoils my happiness, it\nmakes me shiver and tremble and shudder. But I could not persuade him,\nfor he has not discovered fear yet, and so he could not understand me.\n\n\n\nEXTRACT FROM ADAM'S DIARY\n\nPerhaps I ought to remember that she is very young, a mere girl and make\nallowances. She is all interest, eagerness, vivacity, the world is to\nher a charm, a wonder, a mystery, a joy; she can't speak for delight\nwhen she finds a new flower, she must pet it and caress it and smell\nit and talk to it, and pour out endearing names upon it. And she is\ncolor-mad: brown rocks, yellow sand, gray moss, green foliage, blue sky;\nthe pearl of the dawn, the purple shadows on the mountains, the golden\nislands floating in crimson seas at sunset, the pallid moon sailing\nthrough the shredded cloud-rack, the star-jewels glittering in the\nwastes of space--none of them is of any practical value, so far as I can\nsee, but because they have color and majesty, that is enough for her,\nand she loses her mind over them. If she could quiet down and keep still\na couple minutes at a time, it would be a reposeful spectacle. In that\ncase I think I could enjoy looking at her; indeed I am sure I could,\nfor I am coming to realize that she is a quite remarkably comely\ncreature--lithe, slender, trim, rounded, shapely, nimble, graceful; and\nonce when she was standing marble-white and sun-drenched on a boulder,\nwith her young head tilted back and her hand shading her eyes, watching\nthe flight of a bird in the sky, I recognized that she was beautiful.\n\nMONDAY NOON.--If there is anything on the planet that she is not\ninterested in it is not in my list. There are animals that I am\nindifferent to, but it is not so with her. She has no discrimination,\nshe takes to all of them, she thinks they are all treasures, every new\none is welcome.\n\nWhen the mighty brontosaurus came striding into camp, she regarded it as\nan acquisition, I considered it a calamity; that is a good sample of\nthe lack of harmony that prevails in our views of things. She wanted to\ndomesticate it, I wanted to make it a present of the homestead and move\nout. She believed it could be tamed by kind treatment and would be a\ngood pet; I said a pet twenty-one feet high and eighty-four feet long\nwould be no proper thing to have about the place, because, even with the\nbest intentions and without meaning any harm, it could sit down on the\nhouse and mash it, for any one could see by the look of its eye that it\nwas absent-minded.\n\nStill, her heart was set upon having that monster, and she couldn't give\nit up. She thought we could start a dairy with it, and wanted me to help\nmilk it; but I wouldn't; it was too risky. The sex wasn't right, and we\nhadn't any ladder anyway. Then she wanted to ride it, and look at the\nscenery. Thirty or forty feet of its tail was lying on the ground, like\na fallen tree, and she thought she could climb it, but she was mistaken;\nwhen she got to the steep place it was too slick and down she came, and\nwould have hurt herself but for me.\n\nWas she satisfied now? No. Nothing ever satisfies her but demonstration;\nuntested theories are not in her line, and she won't have them. It is\nthe right spirit, I concede it; it attracts me; I feel the influence of\nit; if I were with her more I think I should take it up myself. Well,\nshe had one theory remaining about this colossus: she thought that if we\ncould tame it and make him friendly we could stand him in the river\nand use him for a bridge. It turned out that he was already plenty tame\nenough--at least as far as she was concerned--so she tried her theory,\nbut it failed: every time she got him properly placed in the river and\nwent ashore to cross over him, he came out and followed her around like\na pet mountain. Like the other animals. They all do that.\n\nFRIDAY.--Tuesday--Wednesday--Thursday--and today: all without seeing\nhim. It is a long time to be alone; still, it is better to be alone than\nunwelcome.\n\n\n\nI _had _to have company--I was made for it, I think--so I made friends\nwith the animals. They are just charming, and they have the kindest\ndisposition and the politest ways; they never look sour, they never let\nyou feel that you are intruding, they smile at you and wag their tail,\nif they've got one, and they are always ready for a romp or an excursion\nor anything you want to propose. I think they are perfect gentlemen. All\nthese days we have had such good times, and it hasn't been lonesome for\nme, ever. Lonesome! No, I should say not. Why, there's always a swarm\nof them around--sometimes as much as four or five acres--you can't count\nthem; and when you stand on a rock in the midst and look out over the\nfurry expanse it is so mottled and splashed and gay with color and\nfrisking sheen and sun-flash, and so rippled with stripes, that you\nmight think it was a lake, only you know it isn't; and there's storms\nof sociable birds, and hurricanes of whirring wings; and when the sun\nstrikes all that feathery commotion, you have a blazing up of all the\ncolors you can think of, enough to put your eyes out.\n\nWe have made long excursions, and I have seen a great deal of the world;\nalmost all of it, I think; and so I am the first traveler, and the only\none. When we are on the march, it is an imposing sight--there's nothing\nlike it anywhere. For comfort I ride a tiger or a leopard, because it is\nsoft and has a round back that fits me, and because they are such pretty\nanimals; but for long distance or for scenery I ride the elephant. He\nhoists me up with his trunk, but I can get off myself; when we are ready\nto camp, he sits and I slide down the back way.\n\nThe birds and animals are all friendly to each other, and there are no\ndisputes about anything. They all talk, and they all talk to me, but it\nmust be a foreign language, for I cannot make out a word they say; yet\nthey often understand me when I talk back, particularly the dog and the\nelephant. It makes me ashamed. It shows that they are brighter than I\nam, for I want to be the principal Experiment myself--and I intend to\nbe, too.\n\nI have learned a number of things, and am educated, now, but I wasn't at\nfirst. I was ignorant at first. At first it used to vex me because, with\nall my watching, I was never smart enough to be around when the water\nwas running uphill; but now I do not mind it. I have experimented and\nexperimented until now I know it never does run uphill, except in the\ndark. I know it does in the dark, because the pool never goes dry, which\nit would, of course, if the water didn't come back in the night. It is\nbest to prove things by actual experiment; then you _know_; whereas if\nyou depend on guessing and supposing and conjecturing, you never get\neducated.\n\nSome things you _can't_ find out; but you will never know you can't\nby guessing and supposing: no, you have to be patient and go on\nexperimenting until you find out that you can't find out. And it is\ndelightful to have it that way, it makes the world so interesting. If\nthere wasn't anything to find out, it would be dull. Even trying to find\nout and not finding out is just as interesting as trying to find out and\nfinding out, and I don't know but more so. The secret of the water was\na treasure until I _got _it; then the excitement all went away, and I\nrecognized a sense of loss.\n\nBy experiment I know that wood swims, and dry leaves, and feathers, and\nplenty of other things; therefore by all that cumulative evidence you\nknow that a rock will swim; but you have to put up with simply knowing\nit, for there isn't any way to prove it--up to now. But I shall find a\nway--then _that _excitement will go. Such things make me sad; because\nby and by when I have found out everything there won't be any more\nexcitements, and I do love excitements so! The other night I couldn't\nsleep for thinking about it.\n\nAt first I couldn't make out what I was made for, but now I think it was\nto search out the secrets of this wonderful world and be happy and thank\nthe Giver of it all for devising it. I think there are many things to\nlearn yet--I hope so; and by economizing and not hurrying too fast I\nthink they will last weeks and weeks. I hope so. When you cast up a\nfeather it sails away on the air and goes out of sight; then you throw\nup a clod and it doesn't. It comes down, every time. I have tried it\nand tried it, and it is always so. I wonder why it is? Of course it\n_doesn't_ come down, but why should it _seem _to? I suppose it is an\noptical illusion. I mean, one of them is. I don't know which one. It\nmay be the feather, it may be the clod; I can't prove which it is, I can\nonly demonstrate that one or the other is a fake, and let a person take\nhis choice.\n\nBy watching, I know that the stars are not going to last. I have seen\nsome of the best ones melt and run down the sky. Since one can melt,\nthey can all melt; since they can all melt, they can all melt the same\nnight. That sorrow will come--I know it. I mean to sit up every night\nand look at them as long as I can keep awake; and I will impress those\nsparkling fields on my memory, so that by and by when they are taken\naway I can by my fancy restore those lovely myriads to the black sky and\nmake them sparkle again, and double them by the blur of my tears.\n\nAfter the Fall\n\nWhen I look back, the Garden is a dream to me. It was beautiful,\nsurpassingly beautiful, enchantingly beautiful; and now it is lost, and\nI shall not see it any more.\n\nThe Garden is lost, but I have found _him_, and am content. He loves\nme as well as he can; I love him with all the strength of my passionate\nnature, and this, I think, is proper to my youth and sex. If I ask\nmyself why I love him, I find I do not know, and do not really much\ncare to know; so I suppose that this kind of love is not a product\nof reasoning and statistics, like one's love for other reptiles and\nanimals. I think that this must be so. I love certain birds because of\ntheir song; but I do not love Adam on account of his singing--no, it is\nnot that; the more he sings the more I do not get reconciled to it.\nYet I ask him to sing, because I wish to learn to like everything he is\ninterested in. I am sure I can learn, because at first I could not stand\nit, but now I can. It sours the milk, but it doesn't matter; I can get\nused to that kind of milk.\n\nIt is not on account of his brightness that I love him--no, it is not\nthat. He is not to blame for his brightness, such as it is, for he did\nnot make it himself; he is as God made him, and that is sufficient.\nThere was a wise purpose in it, _that _I know. In time it will develop,\nthough I think it will not be sudden; and besides, there is no hurry; he\nis well enough just as he is.\n\nIt is not on account of his gracious and considerate ways and his\ndelicacy that I love him. No, he has lacks in this regard, but he is\nwell enough just so, and is improving.\n\nIt is not on account of his industry that I love him--no, it is not\nthat. I think he has it in him, and I do not know why he conceals it\nfrom me. It is my only pain. Otherwise he is frank and open with me,\nnow. I am sure he keeps nothing from me but this. It grieves me that he\nshould have a secret from me, and sometimes it spoils my sleep, thinking\nof it, but I will put it out of my mind; it shall not trouble my\nhappiness, which is otherwise full to overflowing.\n\nIt is not on account of his education that I love him--no, it is not\nthat. He is self-educated, and does really know a multitude of things,\nbut they are not so.\n\nIt is not on account of his chivalry that I love him--no, it is not\nthat. He told on me, but I do not blame him; it is a peculiarity of sex,\nI think, and he did not make his sex. Of course I would not have told on\nhim, I would have perished first; but that is a peculiarity of sex, too,\nand I do not take credit for it, for I did not make my sex.\n\nThen why is it that I love him? _Merely because he is masculine_, I\nthink.\n\nAt bottom he is good, and I love him for that, but I could love him\nwithout it. If he should beat me and abuse me, I should go on loving\nhim. I know it. It is a matter of sex, I think.\n\nHe is strong and handsome, and I love him for that, and I admire him\nand am proud of him, but I could love him without those qualities. If\nhe were plain, I should love him; if he were a wreck, I should love\nhim; and I would work for him, and slave over him, and pray for him, and\nwatch by his bedside until I died.\n\nYes, I think I love him merely because he is _mine _and is _masculine_.\nThere is no other reason, I suppose. And so I think it is as I first\nsaid: that this kind of love is not a product of reasonings and\nstatistics. It just _comes_--none knows whence--and cannot explain\nitself. And doesn't need to.\n\nIt is what I think. But I am only a girl, the first that has examined\nthis matter, and it may turn out that in my ignorance and inexperience I\nhave not got it right.\n\nForty Years Later\n\nIt is my prayer, it is my longing, that we may pass from this life\ntogether--a longing which shall never perish from the earth, but shall\nhave place in the heart of every wife that loves, until the end of time;\nand it shall be called by my name.\n\nBut if one of us must go first, it is my prayer that it shall be I;\nfor he is strong, I am weak, I am not so necessary to him as he is to\nme--life without him would not be life; how could I endure it? This\nprayer is also immortal, and will not cease from being offered up while\nmy race continues. I am the first wife; and in the last wife I shall be\nrepeated.\n\nAT EVE'S GRAVE\n\nADAM: Wheresoever she was, _there_ was Eden.",
