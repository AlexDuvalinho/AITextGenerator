 "text": "SHE STANDS ACCUSED\n\n\nBy Victor Macclure\n\n\nBeing a Series of Accounts of the Lives and Deeds of Notorious Women,\nMurderesses, Cheats, Cozeners, on whom Justice was Executed, and of\nothers who, Accused of Crimes, were Acquitted at least in Law; Drawn\nfrom Authenticated Sources\n\n\nTO RAFAEL SABATINI TO WHOSE VIRTUES AS AN AUTHOR AND AS A FRIEND THE\nWRITER WISHES HIS BOOK WERE WORTHIER OF DEDICATION\n\n\n     I:   INTRODUCTORY\n     II:  A FAIR NECK FOR THE MAIDEN\n     III: THE COUNTESS AND THE COZENER\n     IV:  A MODEL FOR MR HOGARTH\n     V:   ALMOST A LADY\n     VI:  ARSENIC A LA BRETONNE\n     VII: THE MERRY WIDOWS\n          INDEX\n\n\n\n\n\nI. -- INTRODUCTORY\n\nI had a thought to call this book Pale Hands or Fair Hands Imbrued--so\neasy it is to fall into the ghastly error of facetiousness.\n\nApart, however, from the desire to avoid pedant or puerile humour,\nre-examination of my material showed me how near I had been to crashing\ninto a pitfall of another sort. Of the ladies with whose encounters with\nthe law I propose to deal several were assoiled of the charges\nagainst them. Their hands, then--unless the present ruddying of female\nfingernails is the revival of an old fashion--were not pink-tipped,\nsave, perhaps, in the way of health; nor imbrued, except in soapsuds. My\nproposed facetiousness put me in peril of libel.\n\nInterest in the criminous doings of women is so alive and avid among\ncriminological writers that it is hard indeed to find material which has\nnot been dealt with to the point of exhaustion. Does one pick up in a\nsecondhand bookshop a pamphlet giving a verbatim report of a trial in\nwhich a woman is the central figure, and does one flatter oneself that\nthe find is unique, and therefore providing of fresh fields, it is\nalmost inevitable that one will discover, or rediscover, that the case\nhas already been put to bed by Mr Roughead in his inimitable manner.\nWhat a nose the man has! What noses all these rechauffeurs of crime\npossess! To use a figure perhaps something unmannerly, the pigs of\nPerigord, which, one hears, are trained to hunt truffles, have snouts no\nkeener.\n\nSuppose, again, that one proposes to deal with the peccancy of women\nfrom the earliest times, it is hard to find a lady, even one whose name\nhas hitherto gleamed lurid in history, to whom some modern writer has\nnot contrived by chapter and verse to apply a coat of whitewash.\n\nLocusta, the poisoner whom Agrippina, wanting to kill the Emperor\nClaudius by slow degrees, called into service, and whose technique Nero\nadmired so much that he was fain to put her on his pension list, barely\nescapes the deodorant. Messalina comes up in memory. And then one\nfinds M. Paul Moinet, in his historical essays En Marge de l'histoire,\ngracefully pleading for the lady as Messaline la calomniee--yes, and\nmaking out a good case for her. The Empress Theodora under the pen of\na psychological expert becomes nothing more dire than a clever little\nwhore disguised in imperial purple.\n\nOn the mention of poison Lucretia Borgia springs to mind. This is the\nlady of whom Gibbon writes with the following ponderous falsity:\n\n\nIn the next generation the house of Este was sullied by a sanguinary and\nincestuous race in the nuptials of Alfonso I with Lucretia, a bastard of\nAlexander VI, the Tiberius of Christian Rome. This modern Lucretia might\nhave assumed with more propriety the name of Messalina, since the woman\nwho can be guilty, who can even be accused, of a criminal intercourse\nwith a father and two brothers must be abandoned to all the\nlicentiousness of a venal love.\n\n\nThat, if the phrase may be pardoned, is swatting a butterfly with a\nsledge-hammer! Poor little Lucretia, described by the excellent M.\nMoinet as a \"bon petit coeur,\" is enveloped in the political ordure\nslung by venal pamphleteers at the masterful men of her race. My friend\nRafael Sabatini, than whom no man living has dug deeper into Borgia\nhistory, explains the calumniation of Lucretia in this fashion: Adultery\nand promiscuous intercourse were the fashion in Rome at the time of\nAlexander VI. Nobody thought anything of them. And to have accused the\nBorgia girl, or her relatives, of such inconsiderable lapses would have\nbeen to evoke mere shrugging. But incest, of course, was horrible. The\nwriters paid by the party antagonistic to the Borgia growth in power\ntherefore slung the more scurrile accusation. But there is, in truth,\njust about as much foundation for the charge as there is for the other,\nthat Lucretia was a poisoner. The answer to the latter accusation, says\nmy same authority, may take the form of a question: WHOM DID LUCRETIA\nPOISON? As far as history goes, even that written by the Borgia enemies,\nthe reply is, NOBODY!\n\nWere one content, like Gibbon, to take one's history like snuff there\nwould be to hand a mass of caliginous detail with which to cause\nshuddering in the unsuspecting reader. But in mere honesty, if in\nnothing else, it behoves the conscientious writer to examine the\nsources of his information. The sources may be--they too frequently\nare--contaminated by political rancour and bias, and calumnious\naccusation against historical figures too often is founded on mere envy.\nAnd then the rechauffeurs, especially where rechauffage is made from\none language to another, have been apt (with a mercenary desire to\ngive their readers as strong a brew as possible) to attach the darkest\nmeanings to the words they translate. In this regard, and still apropos\nthe Borgias, I draw once again on Rafael Sabatini for an example of what\nI mean. Touching the festivities celebrating Lucretia's wedding in the\nVatican, the one eyewitness whose writing remains, Gianandrea Boccaccio,\nFerrarese ambassador, in a letter to his master says that amid singing\nand dancing, as an interlude, a \"worthy\" comedy was performed. The\ndiarist Infessura, who was not there, takes it upon himself to describe\nthe comedy as \"lascivious.\" Lascivious the comedies of the time commonly\nwere, but later writers, instead of drawing their ideas from the\neyewitness, prefer the dark hints of Infessura, and are persuaded that\nthe comedy, the whole festivity, was \"obscene.\" Hence arises the\nnotion, so popular, that the second Borgia Pope delighted in shows which\nanticipated those of the Folies Bergere, or which surpassed the danse du\nventre in lust-excitation.\n\nA statue was made by Guglielmo della Porta of Julia Farnese, Alexander's\nbeautiful second mistress. It was placed on the tomb of her brother\nAlessandro (Pope Paul III). A Pope at a later date provided the lady,\nportrayed in 'a state of nature,' with a silver robe--because, say\nthe gossips, the statue was indecent. Not at all: it was to prevent\nrecurrence of an incident in which the sculptured Julia took a static\npart with a German student afflicted with sex-mania.\n\nI become, however, a trifle excursive, I think. If I do the blame lies\non those partisan writers to whom I have alluded. They have a way of\nleading their incautious latter-day brethren up the garden. They hint at\nflesh-eating lilies by the pond at the path's end, and you find nothing\nmore prone to sarcophagy than harmless primulas. In other words, the\nbeetle-browed Lucretia, with the handy poison-ring, whom they promise\nyou turns out to be a blue-eyed, fair-haired, rather yielding little\ndarling, ultimately an excellent wife and mother, given to piety and\ngood works, used in her earlier years as a political instrument by\nfather and brother, and these two no worse than masterful and ambitious\nmen employing the political technique common to their day and age.\n\n\n\nII\n\nMessalina, Locusta, Lucretia, Theodora, they step aside in this\nparticular review of peccant women. Cleopatra, supposed to have poisoned\nslaves in the spirit of scientific research, or perhaps as punishment\nfor having handed her the wrong lipstick, also is set aside. It were\nsupererogatory to attempt dealing with the ladies mentioned in the Bible\nand the Apocrypha, such as Jael, who drove the nail into the head of\nSisera, or Judith, who cut off the head of Holofernes. Their stories are\nplainly and excellently told in the Scriptural manner, and the adding\nof detail would be mere fictional exercise. Something, perhaps, might\nbe done for them by way of deducing their characters and physical\nshortcomings through examination of their deeds and motives--but this\nmay be left to psychiatrists. There is room here merely for a soupcon of\npsychology--just as much, in fact, as may afford the writer an easy turn\nfrom one plain narrative to another. You will have no more of it than\namounts, say, to the pinch of fennel that should go into the sauce for\nmackerel.\n\nToffana, who in Italy supplied poison to wives aweary of their husbands\nand to ladies beginning to find their lovers inconvenient, and who thus\nat second hand murdered some six hundred persons, has her attractions\nfor the criminological writer. The bother is that so many of them have\nfound it out. The scanty material regarding her has been turned over so\noften that it has become somewhat tattered, and has worn rather thin\nfor refashioning. The same may be said for Hieronyma Spara, a direct\npoisoner and Toffana's contemporary.\n\nThe fashion they set passed to the Marquise de Brinvilliers, and she,\nwith La Vigoureux and La Voisin, has been written up so often that the\ntask of finding something new to say of her and her associates looks far\ntoo formidable for a man as lethargic as myself.\n\nIn the abundance of material that criminal history provides about women\nchoice becomes difficult. There is, for example, a plethora of women\npoisoners. Wherever a woman alone turns to murder it is a hundred to one\nthat she will select poison as a medium. This at first sight may seem a\ncurious fact, but there is for it a perfectly logical explanation, upon\nwhich I hope later to touch briefly. The concern of this book, however,\nis not purely with murder by women, though murder will bulk largely.\nSwindling will be dealt with, and casual allusion made to other crimes.\n\nBut take for the moment the women accused or convicted of poisoning.\nWhat an array they make! What monsters of iniquity many of them\nappear! Perhaps the record, apart from those set up by Toffana and the\nBrinvilliers contingent, is held by the Van der Linden woman of Leyden,\nwho between 1869 and 1885 attempted to dispose of 102 persons, succeeded\nwith no less than twenty-seven, and rendered at least forty-five\nseriously ill. Then comes Helene Jegado, of France, who, according to\none account, with two more working years (eighteen instead of sixteen),\ncontrived to envenom twenty-six people, and attempted the lives of\ntwelve more. On this calculation she fails by one to reach the der\nLinden record, but, even reckoning the two extra years she had to work\nin, since she made only a third of the other's essays, her bowling\naverage may be said to be incomparably better.\n\nOur own Mary Ann Cotton, at work between 1852 and 1873, comes in third,\nwith twenty-four deaths, at least known, as her bag. Mary Ann operated\non a system of her own, and many of her victims were her own children.\nShe is well worth the lengthier consideration which will be given her in\nlater pages.\n\nAnna Zwanziger, the earlier 'monster' of Bavaria, arrested in 1809, was\nan amateur compared with those three.\n\nMrs Susannah Holroyd, of Ashton-under-Lyne, charged in September of 1816\nat the Lancashire Assizes with the murder by poison of her husband,\nher own son, and the infant child of Anna Newton, a lodger of hers, was\nnurse to illegitimate children. She was generally suspected of having\nmurdered several of her charges, but no evidence, as far as I can learn,\nwas brought forward to give weight to the suspicion at her trial. Then\nthere were Mesdames Flanagan and Higgins, found guilty, at Liverpool\nAssizes in February 1884, of poisoning Thomas Higgins, husband of the\nlatter of the accused, by the administration of arsenic. The ladies\nwere sisters, living together in Liverpool. With them in the house in\nSkirvington Street were Flanagan's son John, Thomas Higgins and his\ndaughter Mary, Patrick Jennings and his daughter Margaret.\n\nJohn Flanagan died in December 1880. His mother drew the insurance\nmoney. Next year Thomas Higgins married the younger of the sisters, and\nin the year following Mary Higgins, his daughter, died. Her stepmother\ndrew the insurance money. The year after that Margaret Jennings,\ndaughter of the lodger, died. Once again insurance money was drawn, this\ntime by both sisters.\n\nThomas Higgins passed away that same year in a house to which what\nremained of the menage had removed. He was on the point of being buried,\nas having died of dysentery due to alcoholism, when the suspicions of\nhis brother led the coroner to stop the funeral. The brother had heard\nword of insurance on the life of Thomas. A post-mortem revealed the fact\nthat Thomas had actually died of arsenic poisoning; upon which discovery\nthe bodies of John Flanagan, Mary Higgins, and Margaret Jennings were\nexhumed for autopsy, which revealed arsenic poisoning in each case. The\nprisoners alone had attended the deceased in the last illnesses. Theory\nwent that the poison had been obtained by soaking fly-papers. Mesdames\nFlanagan and Higgins were executed at Kirkdale Gaol in March of 1884.\n\nNow, these are two cases which, if only minor in the wholesale\npoisoning line when compared with the Van der Linden, Jegado, and Cotton\nenvenomings, yet have their points of interest. In both cases the guilty\nwere so far able to banish \"all trivial fond records\" as to dispose of\nkindred who might have been dear to them: Mrs Holroyd of husband and\nson, with lodger's daughter as makeweight; the Liverpool pair of nephew,\nhusband, stepdaughter (or son, brother-in-law, and stepniece, according\nto how you look at it), with again the unfortunate daughter of a\nlodger thrown in. If they \"do things better on the Continent\"--speaking\ngenerally and ignoring our own Mary Ann--there is yet temptation to\nexamine the lesser native products at length, but space and the scheme\nof this book prevent. In the matter of the Liverpool Locustas there is\nan engaging speculation. It was brought to my notice by Mr Alan Brock,\nauthor of By Misadventure and Further Evidence. Just how far did the use\nof flypapers by Flanagan and Higgins for the obtaining of arsenic serve\nas an example to Mrs Maybrick, convicted of the murder of her husband in\nthe same city five years later?\n\nThe list of women poisoners in England alone would stretch interminably.\nIf one were to confine oneself merely to those employing arsenic the\nlist would still be formidable. Mary Blandy, who callously slew her\nfather with arsenic supplied her by her lover at Henley-on-Thames in\n1751, has been a subject for many criminological essayists. That she has\nattracted so much attention is probably due to the double fact that she\nwas a girl in a very comfortable way of life, heiress to a fortune of\nL10,000, and that contemporary records are full and accessible. But\nthere is nothing essentially interesting about her case to make it\nstand out from others that have attracted less notice in a literary way.\nAnother Mary, of a later date, Edith Mary Carew, who in 1892 was found\nguilty by the Consular Court, Yokohama, of the murder of her husband\nwith arsenic and sugar of lead, was an Englishwoman who might have given\nMary Blandy points in several directions.\n\nWhen we leave the arsenical-minded and seek for cases where other\npoisons were employed there is still no lack of material. There is, for\nexample, the case of Sarah Pearson and the woman Black, who were tried\nat Armagh in June 1905 for the murder of the old mother of the latter.\nThe old woman, Alice Pearson (Sarah was her daughter-in-law), was\nin possession of small savings, some forty pounds, which aroused the\ncupidity of the younger women. Their first attempt at murder was with\nmetallic mercury. It rather failed, and the trick was turned by means of\nthree-pennyworth of strychnine, bought by Sarah and mixed with the old\nlady's food. The murder might not have been discovered but for the fact\nthat Sarah, who had gone to Canada, was arrested in Montreal for some\nother offence, and made a confession which implicated her husband and\nBlack. A notable point about the case is the amount of metallic mercury\nfound in the old woman's body: 296 grains--a record.\n\nHaving regard to the condition of life in which these Irishwomen lived,\nthere is nothing, to my mind, in the fact that they murdered for forty\npounds to make their crime more sordid than that of Mary Blandy.\n\nTake, again, the case of Mary Ansell, the domestic servant, who, at\nHertford Assizes in June 1899, was found guilty of the murder of her\nsister, Caroline, by the administration of phosphorus contained in a\ncake. Here the motive for the murder was the insurance made by Ansell\nupon the life of her sister, a young woman of weak intellect confined\nin Leavesden Asylum, Watford. The sum assured was only L22 10s. If Mary\nBlandy poisoned her father in order to be at liberty to marry her lover,\nCranstoun, and to secure the fortune Cranstoun wanted with her, wherein\ndoes she shine above Mary Ansell, a murderess who not only poisoned her\nsister, but nearly murdered several of her sister's fellow-inmates of\nthe asylum, and all for twenty odd pounds? Certainly not in being less\nsordid, certainly not in being more 'romantic.'\n\nThere is, at root, no case of murder proved and accepted as such which\ndoes not contain its points of interest for the criminological writer.\nThere is, indeed, many a case, not only of murder but of lesser\ncrime, that has failed to attract a lot of attention, but that yet,\nin affording matter for the student of crime and criminal psychology,\nsurpasses others which, very often because there has been nothing of\ngreater public moment at the time, were boomed by the Press into the\nprominence of causes celebres.\n\nThere is no need then, after all, for any crime writer who wants to\nfry a modest basket of fish to mourn because Mr Roughead, Mr. Beaufroy\nBarry, Mr Guy Logan, Miss Tennyson Jesse, Mr Leonard R. Gribble, and\nothers of his estimable fellows seem to have swiped all the sole and\nsalmon. It may be a matter for envy that Mr Roughead, with his uncanny\nskill and his gift in piquant sauces, can turn out the haddock and hake\nwith all the delectability of sole a la Normande. The sigh of envy will\nmerge into an exhalation of joy over the artistry of it. And one may\nturn, wholeheartedly and inspired, to see what can be made of one's own\ncatch of gudgeon.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nKipling's line about the female of the species has been quoted,\nparticularly as a text for dissertation on the female criminal, perhaps\nrather too often. There is always a temptation to use the easy gambit.\n\nIt is quite probable that there are moments in a woman's life when she\ndoes become more deadly than the male. The probability is one which no\nman of age and experience will lack instance for making a fact. Without\nseeking to become profound in the matter I will say this: it is but\nlightly as compared with a man that one need scratch a woman to come on\nthe natural creature.\n\nNow, your natural creature, not inhibited by reason, lives by theft,\nmurder, and dissimulation. It lives, even as regards the male, but for\none purpose: to continue its species. Enrage a woman, then, or frighten\nher into the natural creature, and she will discard all those petty\nrules invented by the human male for his advantage over, and his safety\nfrom, the less disciplined members of the species. All that stuff about\n'honour,' 'Queensberry rules,' 'playing the game,' and what not will go\nby the board. And she will fight you with tooth and talon, with lies,\nwith blows below the belt--metaphorically, of course.\n\nIt may well be that you have done nothing more than hurt her pride--the\ncivilized part of her. But instinctively she will fight you as the\nmother animal, either potentially or in being. It will not occur to her\nthat she is doing so. Nor will it occur to you. But the fact that she is\nfighting at all will bring it about, for fighting to any female animal\nmeans defence of her young. She may not have any young in being. That\ndoes not affect the case. She will fight for the ova she carries, for\nthe ova she has yet to develop. Beyond all reason, deep, instinct deep,\nwithin her she is the carrier of the race. This instinct is so profound\nthat she will have no recollection in a crisis of the myriads of her\nlike, but will think of herself as the race's one chance to persist.\nDangerous? Of course she's dangerous--as dangerous as Nature! Just as\ndangerous, just as self-centred, as in its small way is that vegetative\norganism the volvox, which, when food is scarce and the race is\nthreatened, against possible need of insemination, creates separate\nhusband cells to starve in clusters, while 'she' hogs all the\nfood-supply for the production of eggs.\n\nThis small flight into biology is made merely for the dim light it may\ncast on the Kipling half-truth. It is not made to explain why women\ncriminals are more deadly, more cruel, more deeply lost in turpitude,\nthan their male colleagues. But it may help to explain why so many\ncrime-writers, following Lombroso, THINK the female more deadly.\n\nThere is something so deeply shocking in the idea of a woman being other\nthan kind and good, something so antagonistic to the smug conception\nof Eve as the \"minist'ring angel, thou,\" that leaps to extremes in\nexpression are easy.\n\nA drunken woman, however, and for example, is not essentially more\ndegraded than a drunken man. This in spite of popular belief. A\nnymphomaniac is not essentially more degraded than a brothel-haunting\nmale. It may be true that moral sense decays more quickly in a woman\nthan in a man, that the sex-ridden or drink-avid woman touches the deeps\nof degradation more quickly, but the reasons for this are patent. They\nare economic reasons usually, and physical, and not adherent to any\ninevitably weaker moral fibre in the woman.\n\nWomen as a rule have less command of money than men. If they earn what\nthey spend they generally have to seek their satisfactions cheaply; and,\nof course, since their powers of resistance to the debilitating effects\nof alcohol are commonly less than those of men, they more readily lose\nphysical tone. With loss of health goes loss of earning power, loss of\ncaste. The descent, in general, must be quicker. It is much the same in\nnymphomania. Unless the sex-avid woman has a decent income, such as\nwill provide her with those means whereby women preserve the effect of\nattractiveness, she must seek assuagement of her sex-torment with men\nless and less fastidious.\n\nBut it is useless and canting to say that peccant women are worse than\nmen. If we are kind we say so merely because we are more apprehensive\nfor them. Safe women, with but rare exceptions, are notably callous\nabout their sisters astray, and the \"we\" I have used must be taken\ngenerally to signify men. We see the danger for erring women, danger\neconomic and physical. Thinking in terms of the phrase that \"a woman's\nplace is the home,\" we wonder what will become of them. We wonder\nanxiously what man, braver or less fastidious than ourselves, will\naccept the burden of rescuing them, give them the sanctuary of a home.\nWe see them as helpless, pitiable beings. We are shocked to see them\nfall so low.\n\nThere is something of this rather maudlin mentality, generally speaking,\nin our way of regarding women criminals. To think, we say, that a WOMAN\nshould do such things!\n\nBut why should we be more shocked by the commission of a crime by a\nwoman than by a man--even the cruellest of crimes? Take the male and\nfemale in feral creation, and there is nothing to choose between them in\nthe matter of cruelty. The lion and the lioness both live by murder, and\nuntil gravidity makes her slow for the chase the breeding female is by\nall accounts the more dangerous. The she-bear will just as readily eat\nup a colony of grubs or despoil the husbandry of the bees as will her\nmate. If, then, the human animal drops the restraints imposed by law,\nreverting thereby to the theft, murder, and cunning of savagery,\nwhy should it be shocking that the female should equal the male in\ncallousness? Why should it be shocking should she even surpass the male?\nIt is quite possible that, since for physiological reasons she is nearer\nto instinctive motivation than the male, she cannot help being more\nruthless once deterrent inhibition has been sloughed. But is she in fact\nmore dangerous, more deadly as a criminal, than the male?\n\nLombroso--vide Mr Philip Beaufroy Barry in his essay on Anna\nZwanziger--tells us that some of the methods of torture employed by\ncriminal women are so horrible that they cannot be described without\noutraging the laws of decency. Less squeamish than Lombroso or Mr\nBarry, I gather aloud that the tortures have to do with the organs of\ngeneration. But male savages in African and American Indian tribes have\na punishment for adulterous women which will match anything in that\nline women have ever achieved, and men in England itself have wreaked\nperverted vengeance on women in ways indescribable too. Though it may\nbe granted that pain inflicted through the genitals is particularly\nsickening, pain is pain all over the body, and must reach what might be\ncalled saturation-point wherever inflicted. And as regards the invention\nof sickening punishment we need go no farther afield in search for\ningenuity than the list of English kings. Dirty Jamie the Sixth of\nScotland and First of England, under mask of retributive justice, could\nexercise a vein of cruelty that might have turned a Red Indian green\nwith envy. Moreover, doesn't our word expressing cruelty for cruelty's\nsake derive from the name of a man--the Marquis de Sade?\n\nI am persuaded that the reason why so many women murderers have made\nuse of poison in their killings is primarily a simple one, a matter of\nphysique. The average murderess, determined on the elimination of, for\nexample, a husband, must be aware that in physical encounter she would\nhave no chance. Then, again, there is in women an almost inborn aversion\nto the use of weapons. Once in a way, where the murderess was of\nAmazonian type, physical means have been employed for the slaying.\n\nIn this regard Kate Webster, who in 1879 at Richmond murdered and\ndismembered Mrs Julia Thomas, springs to mind. She was, from all\naccounts, an exceedingly virile young woman, strong as a pony, and with\na devil of a temper. Mr Elliot O'Donnell, dealing with her in his essay\nin the \"Notable British Trials\" series, seems to be rather at a\nloss, considering her lack of physical beauty, to account for her\nattractiveness to men and to her own sex. But there is no need to\naccount for it. Such a thing is no phenomenon.\n\nI myself, sitting in a taberna in a small Spanish port, was once\npestered by a couple of British seamen to interpret for them in their\napproaches to the daughter of the house. This woman, who had a voice\nlike a raven, seemed able to give quick and snappy answers to the chaff\nby frequenters of the taberna. Few people in the day-time, either men\nor women, would pass the house if 'Fina happened to be showing without\nstopping to have a word with her. She was not at all gentle in manner,\nbut children ran to her. And yet, without being enormously fat, 'Fina\nmust have weighed close on fifteen stone. She had forearms and biceps\nlike a coal-heaver's. She was black-haired, heavy-browed, squish-nosed,\nmoled, and swarthy, and she had a beard and moustache far beyond the\nstage of incipiency. Yet those two British seamen, fairly decent men,\nneither drunk nor brutish, could not have been more attracted had 'Fina\nhad the beauty of the Mona Lisa herself. I may add that there were other\nwomen handy and that the seamen knew of them.\n\nThis in parenthesis, I hope not inappropriately.\n\nWhere the selected victim, or victims, is, or are, feeble-bodied you\nwill frequently find the murderess using physical means to her end.\nSarah Malcolm, whose case will form one of the chief features of this\nvolume, is an instance in point. Marguerite Diblanc, who strangled\nMme Reil in the latter's house in Park Lane on a day in April 1871,\nis another. Amelia Dyer, the baby-farmer, also strangled her charges.\nElizabeth Brownrigg (1767) beat the feeble Mary Clifford to death. I do\nnot know that great physical difference existed to the advantage of the\nmurderess between her and her older victim, Mrs Phoebe Hogg, who, with\nher baby, was done to death by Mrs Pearcy in October 1890, but the fact\nthat Mrs Hogg had been battered about the head, and that the head had\nbeen almost severed from the body, would seem to indicate that the\nmurderess was the stronger of the two women. The case of Belle Gunness\n(treated by Mr George Dilnot in his Rogues March[1]) might be cited.\nFat, gross-featured, far from attractive though she was, her victims\nwere all men who had married or had wanted to marry her. Mr Dilnot\nsays these victims \"almost certainly numbered more than a hundred.\" She\nmurdered for money, using chloral to stupefy, and an axe for the actual\nkilling. She herself was slain and burned, with her three children, by\na male accomplice whom she was planning to dispose of, he having arrived\nat the point of knowing too much. 1907 was the date of her death at La\nPorte, U.S.A.\n\nIt occurs when the female killer happens to be dramatical-minded that\nshe will use a pistol. Mme Weissmann-Bessarabo, who, with her daughter,\nshot her husband in Paris (August 1920), is of this kind. She and the\ndaughter, Paule-Jacques, seem to have seen themselves as wild, wild\nwomen from the Mexico where they had sometime lived, and were always\nflourishing revolvers.\n\nI would say that the use of poison so much by women murderers has\nreason, first, in the lack of physique for violent methods, but I would\nput alongside that reason this other, that women poisoners usually have\nhad a handy proximity to their victims. They have had contact with their\nvictims in an attendant capacity. I have a suspicion, moreover, that a\ngood number of women poisoners actually chose the medium as THE KINDEST\nWAY. Women, and I might add not a few men, who would be terribly shocked\nby sight or news of a quick but violent death, can contemplate with\nrelative placidity a lingering and painful fatal illness. Propose to a\nwoman the destruction of a mangy stray cat or of an incurably diseased\ndog by means of a clean, well-placed shot, and the chances are that she\nwill shudder. But--no lethal chamber being available--suggest poison,\nalbeit unspecified, and the method will more readily commend itself.\nThis among women with no murderous instincts whatever.\n\nI have a fancy also that in some cases of murder by poison, not only by\nwomen, the murderer has been able to dramatize herself or himself ahead\nas a tender, noble, and self-sacrificing attendant upon the victim.\nNo need here, I think, to number the cases where the ministrations of\nmurderers to their victims have aroused the almost tearful admiration of\nbeholders.\n\nI shall say nothing of the secrecy of the poison method, of the chance\nwhich still exists, in spite of modern diagnosis, that the illness\ninduced by it will pass for one arising from natural causes. This is\nground traversed so often that its features are as familiar as those of\none's own house door. Nor shall I say anything of the ease with which,\neven in these days, the favourite poison of the woman murderer, arsenic,\ncan be obtained in one form or another.\n\nOne hears and reads, however, a great deal about the sense of power\nwhich gradually steals upon the poisoner. It is a speculation upon\nwhich I am not ready to argue. There is, indeed, chapter and verse for\nbelieving that poisoners have arrived at a sense of omnipotence. But if\nAnna Zwanziger (here I quote from Mr Philip Beaufroy Barry's essay on\nher in his Twenty Human Monsters), \"a day or two before the execution,\nsmiled and said it was a fortunate thing for many people that she was to\ndie, for had she lived she would have continued to poison men and women\nindiscriminately\"; if, still according to the same writer, \"when the\narsenic was found on her person after the arrest, she seized the packet\nand gloated over the powder, looking at it, the chronicler assures us,\nas a woman looks at her lover\"; and if, \"when the attendants asked her\nhow she could have brought herself calmly to kill people with whom she\nwas living--whose meals and amusements she shared--she replied that\ntheir faces were so stupidly healthy and happy that she desired to see\nthem change into faces of pain and despair,\" I will say this in no way\ngoes to prove the woman criminal to be more deadly than the male. This\nghoulish satisfaction, with the conjectured feeling of omnipotence, is\nnot peculiar to the woman poisoner. Neill Cream had it. Armstrong had\nit. Wainewright, with his reason for poisoning Helen Abercrombie--\"Upon\nmy soul I don't know, unless it was that her legs were too thick\"--is\nquite on a par with Anna Zwanziger. The supposed sense of power does not\neven belong exclusively to the poisoner. Jack the Ripper manifestly had\nsomething of the same idea about his use of the knife.\n\nAs a monster in mass murder against Mary Ann Cotton I will set you\nthe Baron Gilles de Rais, with his forty flogged, outraged, obscenely\nmutilated and slain children in one of his castles alone--his total\nof over two hundred children thus foully done to death. I will set you\nGilles against anything that can be brought forward as a monster in\ncruelty among women.\n\nAgainst the hypocrisy of Helene Jegado I will set you the sanctimonious\nDr Pritchard, with the nauseating entry in his diary (quoted by Mr\nRoughead) recording the death of the wife he so cruelly murdered:\n\n\nMarch 1865, 18, Saturday. Died here at 1 A.M. Mary Jane, my own beloved\nwife, aged thirty-eight years. No torment surrounded her bedside [the\nfoul liar!]--but like a calm peaceful lamb of God passed Minnie away.\nMay God and Jesus, Holy Ghost, one in three, welcome Minnie! Prayer on\nprayer till mine be o'er; everlasting love. Save us, Lord, for Thy dear\nSon!\n\n\nAgainst the mean murders of Flanagan and Higgins I will set you Mr\nSeddon and Mr Smith of the \"brides in the bath.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\nI am conscious that in arguing against the \"more deadly than the male\"\nconception of the woman criminal I am perhaps doing my book no great\nservice. It might work for its greater popularity if I argued the\nother way, making out that the subjects I have chosen were monsters\nof brutality, with arms up to the shoulders in blood, that they were\nprodigies of iniquity and cunning, without bowels, steeped in hypocrisy,\nfacinorous to a degree never surpassed or even equalled by evil men.\nIt may seem that, being concerned to strip female crime of the lurid\npreeminence so commonly given it, I have contrived beforehand to rob\nthe ensuing pages of any richer savour they might have had. But I don't,\nmyself, think so.\n\nIf these women, some of them, are not greater monsters than their male\nanalogues, monsters they still remain. If they are not, others of them,\ngreater rogues and cheats than males of like criminal persuasion, cheats\nand rogues they are beyond cavil. The truth of the matter is that I\nloathe the use of superlatives in serious works on crime. I will read, I\npromise you, anything decently written in a fictional way about 'master'\ncrooks, 'master' killers, kings, queens, princes, and a whole peerage of\ncrime, knowing very well that never yet has a 'master' criminal had\nany cleverness but what a novelist gave him. But in works on crime that\npretend to seriousness I would eschew, pace Mr Leonard R. Gribble, all\n'queens' and other honorifics in application to the lost men and women\nwith whom such works must treat. There is no romance in crime. Romance\nis life gilded, life idealized. Crime is never anything but a sordid\nbusiness, demonstrably poor in reward to its practitioners.\n\nBut, sordid or not, crime has its human interest. Its practitioners are\nstill part of life, human beings, different from law-abiding humanity by\nGod-alone-knows-what freak of heredity or kink in brain convolution. I\nwill not ask the reader, as an excuse for my book, to view the criminal\nwith the thought attributed to John Knox:\n\n\"There, but for the Grace of God, goes ----\" Because the phrase might as\nwell be used in contemplation of John D. Rockefeller or Augustus John or\nCharlie Chaplin or a man with a wooden leg. I do not ask that you should\npity these women with whom I have to deal, still less that you should\ncontemn them. Something between the two will serve. I write the book\nbecause I am interested in crime myself, and in the hope that you'll\nlike the reading as much as I like the writing of it.\n\n\n\n\nII. -- A FAIR NECK FOR THE MAIDEN\n\nIn her long history there can have been few mornings upon which\nEdinburgh had more to offer her burghers in the way of gossip and rumour\nthan on that of the 1st of July, 1600. In this 'gate' and that 'gate,'\nas one may imagine, the douce citizens must have clustered and broke\nand clustered, like eddied foam on a spated burn. By conjecture, as they\nhave always been a people apt to take to the streets upon small occasion\nas on large, it is not unlikely that the news which was to drift into\nthe city some thirty-five days later--namely, that an attempt on the\nlife of his Sacred Majesty, the High and Mighty (and Rachitic) Prince,\nJames the Sixth of Scotland, had been made by the brothers Ruthven in\ntheir castle of Gowrie--it is not unlikely that the first buzz of the\nGowrie affair caused no more stir, for the time being at any rate, than\nthe word which had come to those Edinburgh folk that fine morning of\nthe first day in July. The busier of the bodies would trot from knot\nto knot, anxious to learn and retail the latest item of fact and fancy\nregarding the tidings which had set tongues going since the early hours.\nMurder, no less.\n\nIf the contemporary juridical records, even what is left of them, be\na criterion, homicide in all its oddly named forms must have been a\ncommonplace to those couthie lieges of his Slobberiness, King Jamie. It\nis hard to believe that murder, qua murder, could have been of much more\ninterest to them than the fineness of the weather. We have it, however,\non reasonable authority, that the murder of the Laird of Warriston did\nset the people of \"Auld Reekie\" finely agog.\n\nJohn Kincaid, of Warriston, was by way of being one of Edinburgh's\nnotables. Even at that time his family was considered to be old. He\nderived from the Kincaids of Kincaid, in Stirlingshire, a family then\nin possession of large estates in that county and here and there about\nLothian. His own property of Warriston lay on the outskirts of Edinburgh\nitself, just above a mile from Holyroodhouse. Notable among his\npossessions was one which he should, from all accounts, dearly have\nprized, but which there are indications he treated with some contumely.\nThis was his wife, Jean Livingstone, a singularly beautiful girl, no\nmore than twenty-one years of age at the time when this story opens.\nJean, like her husband, was a person of good station indeed. She was a\ndaughter of the Laird of Dunipace, John Livingstone, and related through\nhim and her mother to people of high consideration in the kingdom.\n\nNews of the violent death of John Kincaid, which had taken place soon\nafter midnight, came quickly to the capital. Officers were at once\ndispatched. Small wonder that the burghers found exercise for their\nclacking tongues from the dawning, for the lovely Jean was taken by the\nofficers 'red-hand,' as the phrase was, for the murder of her husband.\nWith her to Edinburgh, under arrest, were brought her nurse and two\nother serving-women.\n\nTo Pitcairn, compiler of Criminal Trials in Scotland, from indications\nin whose account of the murder I have been set on the hunt for material\nconcerning it, I am indebted for the information that Jean and her women\nwere taken red-hand. But I confess being at a loss to understand it.\nWarriston, as indicated, stood a good mile from Edinburgh. The informant\nbringing word of the deed to town, even if he or she covered the\ndistance on horseback, must have taken some time in getting the proper\nauthorities to move. Then time would elapse in quantity before the\nofficers dispatched could be at the house. They themselves could hardly\nhave taken the Lady Warriston red-hand, because in the meantime the\nactual perpetrator of the murder, a horse-boy named Robert Weir, in the\nemploy of Jean's father, had made good his escape. As a fact, he was\nnot apprehended until some time afterwards, and it would seem, from the\nrecords given in the Pitcairn Trials, that it was not until four years\nlater that he was brought to trial.\n\nA person taken red-hand, it would be imagined, would be one found in\nsuch circumstances relating to a murder as would leave no doubt as to\nhis or her having \"airt and pairt\" in the crime. Since it must have\ntaken the officers some time to reach the house, one of two things must\nhave happened. Either some officious person or persons, roused by the\nkilling, which, as we shall see, was done with no little noise, must\nhave come upon Jean and her women immediately upon the escape of Weir,\nand have detained all four until the arrival of the officers, or else\nJean and her women must have remained by the dead man in terror,\nand have blurted out the truth of their complicity when the officers\nappeared.\n\nAvailable records are irritatingly uninformative upon the arrest of the\nLady Warriston. Pitcairn himself, in 1830, talks of his many \"fruitless\nsearches\" through the Criminal Records of the city of Edinburgh, the\ngreater part of which are lost, and confesses his failure to come on any\ntrace of the actual proceedings in this case, or in the case of Robert\nWeir. For this reason the same authority is at a loss to know whether\nthe prisoners were immediately put to the knowledge of an assize, being\ntaken \"red-hand,\" without the formality of being served a \"dittay\"\n(as who should say an indictment), as in ordinary cases, before the\nmagistrates of Edinburgh, or else sent for trial before the baron\nbailie of the regality of Broughton, in whose jurisdiction Warriston was\nsituated.\n\nIt would perhaps heighten the drama of the story if it could be learned\nwhat Jean and her women did between the time of the murder and the\narrest. It would seem, however, that the Lady Warriston had some\nintention of taking flight with Weir. One is divided between an idea\nthat the horse-boy did not want to be hampered and that he was ready for\nself-sacrifice. \"You shall tarry still,\" we read that he said; \"and if\nthis matter come not to light you shall say, 'He died in the gallery,'\nand I shall return to my master's service. But if it be known I shall\nfly, and take the crime on me, and none dare pursue you!\"\n\nIt was distinctly a determined affair of murder. The loveliness of Jean\nLivingstone has been so insisted upon in many Scottish ballads,[2] and\nher conduct before her execution was so saintly, that one cannot help\nwishing, even now, that she could have escaped the scaffold. But there\nis no doubt that, incited by the nurse, Janet Murdo, she set about\nhaving her husband killed with a rancour which was very grim indeed.\n\n\n   \"She has twa weel-made feet;\n   Far better is her hand;\n   She's jimp about the middle\n   As ony willy wand.\"\n\n\nThe reason for Jean's hatred of her husband appears in the dittay\nagainst Robert Weir. \"Forasmuch,\" it runs, translated to modern terms,\n\n\nas whilom Jean Livingstone, Goodwife of Warriston, having conceived\na deadly rancour, hatred, and malice against whilom John Kincaid, of\nWarriston, for the alleged biting of her in the arm, and striking her\ndivers times, the said Jean, in the month of June, One Thousand Six\nHundred Years, directed Janet Murdo, her nurse, to the said Robert\n[Weir], to the abbey of Holyroodhouse, where he was for the time,\ndesiring him to come down to Warriston, and speak with her, anent the\ncruel and unnatural taking away of her said husband's life.\n\n\nAnd there you have it. If the allegation against John Kincaid was true\nit does not seem that he valued his lovely wife as he ought to have\ndone. The striking her \"divers times\" may have been an exaggeration.\nIt probably was. Jean and her women would want to show there had been\nprovocation. (In a ballad he is accused of having thrown a plate at\ndinner in her face.) But there is a naivete, a circumstantial air, about\nthe \"biting of her in the arm\" which gives it a sort of genuine ring.\nHow one would like to come upon a contemporary writing which would throw\nlight on the character of John Kincaid! Growing sympathy for Jean makes\none wish it could be found that Kincaid deserved all he got.\n\nHere and there in the material at hand indications are to be found that\nthe Lady of Warriston had an idea she might not come so badly off on\ntrial. But even if the King's Majesty had been of clement disposition,\nwhich he never was, or if her judges had been likely to be moved by her\nyouth and beauty, there was evidence of such premeditation, such fixity\nof purpose, as would no doubt harden the assize against her.\n\nRobert Weir was in service, as I have said, with Jean Livingstone's\nfather, the Laird of Dunipace. It may have been that he knew Jean before\nher marriage. He seems, at any rate, to have been extremely willing to\nstand by her. He was fetched by the nurse several times from Holyrood to\nWarriston, but failed to have speech with the lady. On the 30th of June,\nhowever, the Lady Warriston having sent the nurse for him once again, he\ndid contrive to see Jean in the afternoon, and, according to the dittay,\n\"conferred with her, concerning the cruel, unnatural, and abominable\nmurdering of the said whilom John Kincaid.\"\n\nThe upshot of the conference was that Weir was secretly led to a \"laigh\"\ncellar in the house of Warriston, to await the appointed time for the\nexecution of the murder.\n\nWeir remained in the cellar until midnight. Jean came for him at that\nhour and led him up into the hall. Thence the pair proceeded to the room\nin which John Kincaid was lying asleep. It would appear that they took\nno great pains to be quiet in their progress, for on entering the room\nthey found Kincaid awakened \"be thair dyn.\"\n\nI cannot do better at this point than leave description of the murder as\nit is given in the dittay against Weir. The editor of Pitcairn's Trials\nremarks in a footnote to the dittay that \"the quaintness of the ancient\nstyle even aggravates the horror of the scene.\" As, however, the ancient\nstyle may aggravate the reader unacquainted with Scots, I shall English\nit, and give the original rendering in a footnote:\n\n\nAnd having entered within the said chamber, perceiving the said whilom\nJohn to be wakened out of his sleep by their din, and to pry over his\nbed-stock, the said Robert came then running to him, and most cruelly,\nwith clenched fists, gave him a deadly and cruel stroke on the jugular\nvein, wherewith he cast the said whilom John to the ground, from out his\nbed; and thereafter struck him on his belly with his feet; whereupon he\ngave a great cry. And the said Robert, fearing the cry should have been\nheard, he thereafter, most tyrannously and barbarously, with his hand,\ngripped him by the throat, or weasand, which he held fast a long time,\nwhile [or until] he strangled him; during the which time the said John\nKincaid lay struggling and fighting in the pains of death under him.\nAnd so the said whilom John was cruelly murdered and slain by the said\nRobert.[3]\n\nIt will be seen that Robert Weir evolved a murder technique which,\nas Pitcairn points out, was to be adopted over two centuries later in\nEdinburgh at the Westport by Messrs Burke and Hare.\n\n\n\nII\n\nLady Warriston was found guilty, and four days after the murder, on the\n5th of July, was taken to the Girth Cross of Holyrood, at the foot\nof the Canongate, and there decapitated by that machine which rather\nanticipated the inventiveness of Dr Guillotin--\"the Maiden.\" At the same\ntime, four o'clock in the morning, Janet Murdo, the nurse, and one of\nthe serving-women accused with her as accomplices were burned on the\nCastle Hill of the city.\n\nThere is something odd about the early hour at which the executions took\nplace. The usual time for these affairs was much later in the day, and\nit is probable that the sentence against Jean ran that she should be\nexecuted towards dusk on the 4th of the month. The family of Dunipace,\nhowever, having exerted no influence towards saving the daughter of the\nhouse from her fate, did everything they could to have her disposed of\nas secretly and as expeditiously as possible. In their zeal to have done\nwith the hapless girl who, they conceived, had blotted the family honour\nindelibly they were in the prison with the magistrates soon after three\no'clock, quite indecent in their haste to see her on her way to the\nscaffold. In the first place they had applied to have her executed at\nnine o'clock on the evening of the 3rd, another unusual hour, but the\napplication was turned down. The main idea with them was to have Jean\ndone away with at some hour when the populace would not be expecting the\nexecution. Part of the plan for privacy is revealed in the fact of the\nburning of the nurse and the \"hyred woman\" at four o'clock at the Castle\nHill, nearly a mile away from the Girth Cross, so--as the Pitcairn\nTrials footnote says-\"that the populace, who might be so early astir,\nshould have their attentions distracted at two opposite stations... and\nthus, in some measure, lessen the disgrace of the public execution.\"\n\nIf Jean had any reason to thank her family it was for securing, probably\nas much on their own behalf as hers, that the usual way of execution\nfor women murderers should be altered in her case to beheading by \"the\nMaiden.\" Had she been of lesser rank she would certainly have been\nburned, after being strangled at a stake, as were her nurse and the\nserving-woman. This was the appalling fate reserved for convicted\nwomen[4] in such cases, and on conviction even of smaller crimes.\nThe process was even crueller in instances where the crime had been\nparticularly atrocious. \"The criminal,\" says the Pitcairn account of\nsuch punishment, \"was 'brunt quick'!\"\n\nAltogether, the Dunipace family do not exactly shine with a good light\nas concerns their treatment of the condemned girl. Her father stood\ncoldly aside. The quoted footnote remarks:\n\n\nIt is recorded that the Laird of Dunipace behaved with much apathy\ntowards his daughter, whom he would not so much as see previous to her\nexecution; nor yet would he intercede for her, through whose delinquency\nhe reckoned his blood to be for ever dishonoured.\n\n\nJean herself was in no mind to be hurried to the scaffold as early as\nher relatives would have had her conveyed. She wanted (poor girl!) to\nsee the sunrise, and to begin with the magistrates granted her request.\nIt would appear, however, that Jean's blood-relations opposed the\nconcession so strongly that it was almost immediately rescinded. The\nculprit had to die in the grey dark of the morning, before anyone was\nlikely to be astir.\n\nIn certain directions there was not a little heart-burning about the\nuntimely hour at which it was manoeuvred the execution should be carried\nout. The writer of a Memorial, from which this piece of information is\ndrawn, refrains very cautiously from mentioning the objectors by name.\nBut it is not difficult, from the colour of their objections, to decide\nthat these people belonged to the type still known in Scotland as the\n'unco guid.' They saw in the execution of this fair malefactor a moral\nlesson and a solemn warning which would have a salutary and uplifting\neffect upon the spectators.\n\n\"Will you,\" they asked the presiding dignitaries, and the\nblood-relations of the hapless Jean, \"deprive God's people of that\ncomfort which they might have in that poor woman's death? And will you\nobstruct the honour of it by putting her away before the people rise out\nof their beds? You do wrong in so doing; for the more public the death\nbe, the more profitable it shall be to many; and the more glorious, in\nthe sight of all who shall see it.\"\n\nBut perhaps one does those worthies an injustice in attributing cant\nmotives to their desire that as many people as possible should see Jean\ndie. It had probably reached them that the Lady Warriston's repentance\nhad been complete, and that after conviction of her sin had come to her\nher conduct had been sweet and seemly. They were of their day and\nage, those people, accustomed almost daily to beheadings, stranglings,\nburnings, hangings, and dismemberings. With that dour, bitter,\nfire-and-brimstone religious conception which they had through Knox from\nCalvin, they were probably quite sincere in their belief that the public\nrepentance Jean Livingstone was due to make from the scaffold would\nbe for the \"comfort of God's people.\" It was not so often that justice\nexacted the extreme penalty from a young woman of rank and beauty. With\n\"dreadful objects so familiar\" in the way of public executions, it was\nlikely enough that pity in the commonalty was \"choked with custom\nof fell deeds.\" Something out of the way in the nature of a dreadful\nobject-lesson might stir the hearts of the populace and make them\nconscious of the Wrath to Come.\n\nAnd Jean Livingstone did die a good death.\n\nThe Memorial[5] which I have mentioned is upon Jean's 'conversion' in\nprison. It is written by one \"who was both a seer and hearer of what\nwas spoken [by the Lady Warriston].\" The editor of the Pitcairn Trials\nbelieves, from internal evidence, that it was written by Mr James\nBalfour, colleague of Mr Robert Bruce, that minister of the Kirk who\nwas so contumacious about preaching what was practically a plea of the\nKing's innocence in the matter of the Gowrie mystery. It tells how Jean,\nfrom being completely apathetic and callous with regard to religion or\nto the dreadful situation in which she found herself through her crime,\nunder the patient and tender ministrations of her spiritual advisers,\narrived at complete resignation to her fate and genuine repentance for\nher misdeeds.\n\nHer confession, as filleted from the Memorial by the Pitcairn Trials, is\nas follows:\n\nI think I shall hear presently the pitiful and fearful cries which\nhe gave when he was strangled! And that vile sin which I committed\nin murdering my own husband is yet before me. When that horrible and\nfearful sin was done I desired the unhappy man who did it (for my own\npart, the Lord knoweth I laid never my hands upon him to do him evil;\nbut as soon as that man gripped him and began his evil turn, so soon as\nmy husband cried so fearfully, I leapt out over my bed and went to the\nHall, where I sat all the time, till that unhappy man came to me and\nreported that mine husband was dead), I desired him, I say, to take me\naway with him; for I feared trial; albeit flesh and blood made me think\nmy father's moen [interest] at Court would have saved me!\n\n\nWell, we know what the Laird of Dunipace did about it.\n\n\"As to these women who was challenged with me,\" the confession goes on,\n\n\nI will also tell my mind concerning them. God forgive the nurse, for\nshe helped me too well in mine evil purpose; for when I told her I was\nminded to do so she consented to the doing of it; and upon Tuesday, when\nthe turn was done, when I sent her to seek the man who would do it,\nshe said, \"I shall go and seek him; and if I get him not I shall seek\nanother! And if I get none I shall do it myself!\"\n\n\nHere the writer of the Memorial interpolates the remark, \"This the nurse\nalso confessed, being asked of it before her death.\" It is a misfortune,\nequalling that of the lack of information regarding the character of\nJean's husband, that there is so little about the character of the\nnurse. She was, it is to be presumed, an older woman than her mistress,\nprobably nurse to Jean in her infancy. One can imagine her (the stupid\ncreature!) up in arms against Kincaid for his treatment of her \"bonny\nlamb,\" without the sense to see whither she was urging her young\nmistress; blind to the consequences, but \"nursing her wrath\" and\nstriding purposefully from Warriston to Holyroodhouse on her strong\nplebeian legs, not once but several times, in search of Weir! What is\nknown in Scotland as a 'limmer,' obviously.\n\n\"As for the two other women,\" Jean continues,\n\n\nI request that you neither put them to death nor any torture, because I\ntestify they are both innocent, and knew nothing of this deed before it\nwas done, and the mean time of doing it; and that they knew they durst\nnot tell, for fear; for I compelled them to dissemble. As for mine own\npart, I thank my God a thousand times that I am so touched with the\nsense of that sin now: for I confess this also to you, that when that\nhorrible murder was committed first, that I might seem to be innocent, I\nlaboured to counterfeit weeping; but, do what I could, I could not find\na tear.\n\n\nOf the whole confession that last is the most revealing touch. It is\nhardly just to fall into pity for Jean simply because she was young and\nlovely. Her crime was a bad one, much more deliberate than many that, in\nthe same age, took women of lower rank in life than Jean to the crueller\nend of the stake. In the several days during which she was sending for\nWeir, but failing to have speech with him, she had time to review her\nintention of having her husband murdered. If the nurse was the prime\nmover in the plot Jean was an unrelenting abettor. It may have been\nin her calculations before, as well as after, the deed itself that the\ninterest of her father and family at Court would save her, should the\ndeed have come to light as murder. Even in these days, when justice is\nso much more seasoned with mercy to women murderers, a woman in Jean's\ncase, with such strong evidence of premeditation against her, would\nonly narrowly escape the hangman, if she escaped him at all. But that\nconfession of trying to pretend weeping and being unable to find tears\nis a revelation. I can think of nothing more indicative of terror and\nmisery in a woman than that she should want to cry and be unable to.\nYour genuinely hypocritical murderer, male as well as female, can always\nwork up self-pity easily and induce the streaming eye.\n\nIt is from internal evidences such as this that one may conclude the\nrepentance of Jean Livingstone, as shown in her confession, to have been\nsincere. There was, we are informed by the memorialist, nothing maudlin\nin her conduct after condemnation. Once she got over her first obduracy,\ninduced, one would imagine, by the shock of seeing the realization of\nwhat she had planned but never pictured, the murder itself, and probably\nby the desertion of her by her father and kindred, her repentance was\n\"cheerful\" and \"unfeigned.\" They were tough-minded men, those Scots\ndivines who ministered to her at the last, too stern in their theology\nto be misled by any pretence at finding grace. And no pretty ways of\nJean's would have deceived them. The constancy of behaviour which is\nvouched for, not only by the memorialist but by other writers, stayed\nwith her until the axe fell.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\"She was but a woman and a bairn, being the age of twenty-one years,\"\nsays the Memorial. But, \"in the whole way, as she went to the place of\nexecution, she behaved herself so cheerfully as if she had been going\nto her wedding, and not to her death. When she came to the scaffold, and\nwas carried up upon it, she looked up to 'the Maiden' with two longsome\nlooks, for she had never seen it before.\"\n\nThe minister-memorialist, who attended her on the scaffold, says that\nall who saw Jean would bear record with himself that her countenance\nalone would have aroused emotion, even if she had never spoken a word.\n\"For there appeared such majesty in her countenance and visage, and\nsuch a heavenly courage in her gesture, that many said, 'That woman is\nravished by a higher spirit than a man or woman's!'\"\n\nAs for the Declaration and Confession which, according to custom, Jean\nmade from the four corners of the scaffold, the memorialist does not\npretend to give it verbatim. It was, he says, almost in a form of words,\nand he gives the sum of it thus:\n\n\nThe occasion of my coming here is to show that I am, and have been, a\ngreat sinner, and hath offended the Lord's Majesty; especially, of the\ncruel murdering of mine own husband, which, albeit I did not with mine\nown hands, for I never laid mine hands upon him all the time that he was\nmurdering, yet I was the deviser of it, and so the committer. But my\nGod hath been always merciful to me, and hath given me repentance for\nmy sins; and I hope for mercy and grace at his Majesty's hands, for his\ndear son Jesus Christ's sake. And the Lord hath brought me hither to\nbe an example to you, that you may not fall into the like sin as I have\ndone. And I pray God, for his mercy, to keep all his faithful people\nfrom falling into the like inconvenient as I have done! And therefore I\ndesire you all to pray to God for me, that he would be merciful to me!\n\n\nOne wonders just how much of Jean's own words the minister-memorialist\ngot into this, his sum of her confession. Her speech would be coloured\ninevitably by the phrasing she had caught from her spiritual advisers,\nand the sum of it would almost unavoidably have something of the\nmemorialist's own fashion of thought. I would give a good deal to know\nif Jean did actually refer to the Almighty as \"the Lord's Majesty,\"\nand hope for \"grace at his Majesty's hands.\" I do not think I am being\noversubtle when I fancy that, if Jean did use those words, I see an\nelement of confusion in her scaffold confession--the trembling confusion\nremaining from a lost hope. As a Scot, I have no recollection of ever\nhearing the Almighty referred to as \"the Lord's Majesty\" or as \"his\nMajesty.\" It does not ring naturally to my ear. Nor, at the long\ndistance from which I recollect reading works of early Scottish divines,\ncan I think of these forms being used in such a context. I may be--I\nvery probably am--all wrong, but I have a feeling that up to the last\nJean Livingstone believed royal clemency would be shown to her, and that\nthis belief appears in the use of these unwonted phrases.\n\nHowever that may be, Jean's conduct seems to have been heroic and\nunfaltering. She prayed, and one of her relations or friends brought \"a\nclean cloath\" to tie over her eyes. Jean herself had prepared for this\noperation, for she took a pin out of her mouth and gave it into the\nfriend's hand to help the fastening. The minister-memorialist, having\ntaken farewell of her for the last time, could not bear the prospect of\nwhat was about to happen. He descended from the scaffold and went away.\n\"But she,\" he says, as a constant saint of God, humbled herself on her\nknees, and offered her neck to the axe, laying her neck, sweetly and\ngraciously, in the place appointed, moving to and fro, till she got a\nrest for her neck to lay in. When her head was now made fast to \"the\nMaiden\" the executioner came behind her and pulled out her feet, that\nher neck might be stretched out longer, and so made more meet for the\nstroke of the axe; but she, as it was reported to me by him who saw\nit and held her by the hands at this time, drew her legs twice to her\nagain, labouring to sit on her knees, till she should give up her spirit\nto the Lord! During this time, which was long, for the axe was but\nslowly loosed, and fell not down hastily, after laying of her head, her\ntongue was not idle, but she continued crying to the Lord, and uttered\nwith a loud voice those her wonted words, \"Lord Jesus, receive my\nspirit! O Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world, have\nmercy upon me! Into thy hand, Lord, I commend my soul!\" When she came to\nthe middle of this last sentence, and had said, \"Into thy hand, Lord,\"\nat the pronouncing of the word \"Lord\" the axe fell; which was diligently\nmarked by one of her friends, who still held her by the hand, and\nreported this to me.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nOn the 26th of June, 1604, Robert Weir, \"sumtyme servande to the Laird\nof Dynniepace,\" was brought to knowledge of an assize. He was \"Dilaitit\nof airt and pairt of the crewall Murthour of umqle Johnne Kincaid of\nWariestoune; committit the first of Julij, 1600 yeiris.\"\n\n\nVerdict.

A printed copy was\nmade in 1828, under the editorship of J. Sharpe, in the same city.\nThis edition contains, among other more relative matter, a reprint of\na newspaper account of an execution by strangling and burning at the\nstake. The woman concerned was not the last victim in Britain of\nthis form of execution. The honour, I believe, belongs to one Anne\nCruttenden. The account is full of gruesome and graphic detail, but the\nobserver preserves quite an air of detachment:\n\n\nIVELCHESTER: 9th May, 1765. Yesterday Mary Norwood, for poisoning her\nhusband, Joseph Norwood, of Axbridge, in this county [Somerset], was\nburnt here pursuant to her sentence. She was brought out of the prison\nabout three o'clock in the afternoon, barefoot; she was covered with a\ntarred cloth, made like a shift, and a tarred bonnet over her head;\nand her legs, feet, and arms had likewise tar on them; the heat of\nthe weather melting the tar, it ran over her face, so that she made a\nshocking appearance. She was put on a hurdle, and drawn on a sledge to\nthe place of execution, which was very near the gallows. After spending\nsome time in prayer, and singing a hymn, the executioner placed her on a\ntar barrel, about three feet high; a rope (which was in a pulley through\nthe stake) was fixed about her neck, she placing it properly with her\nhands; this rope being drawn extremely tight with the pulley, the tar\nbarrel was then pushed away, and three irons were then fastened around\nher body, to confine it to the stake, that it might not drop when the\nrope should be burnt. As soon as this was done the fire was immediately\nkindled; but in all probability she was quite dead before the fire\nreached her, as the executioner pulled her body several times whilst\nthe irons were fixing, which was about five minutes. There being a good\nquantity of tar, and the wood in the pile being quite dry, the fire\nburnt with amazing fury; notwithstanding which great part of her could\nbe discerned for near half an hour. Nothing could be more affecting than\nto behold, after her bowels fell out, the fire flaming between her\nribs, issuing out of her ears, mouth, eyeholes, etc. In short, it was so\nterrible a sight that great numbers turned their backs and screamed out,\nnot being able to look at it.\n\n\n\n\nIII: -- THE COUNTESS AND THE COZENER\n\nIt is hardly likely when that comely but penniless young Scot Robert\nCarr, of Ferniehurst, fell from his horse and broke his leg that any of\nthe spectators of the accident foresaw how far-reaching it would be\nin its consequences. It was an accident, none the less, which in its\nultimate results was to put several of the necks craned to see it in\nperil of the hangman's noose.\n\nThat divinely appointed monarch King James the Sixth of Scotland and\nFirst of England had an eye for manly beauty. Though he could contrive\nthe direst of cruelties to be committed out of his sight, the actual\nspectacle of physical suffering in the human made him squeamish. Add\nthe two facts of the King's nature together and it may be understood\nhow Robert Carr, in falling from his horse that September day in the\ntilt-yard of Whitehall, fell straight into his Majesty's favour. King\nJames himself gave orders for the disposition of the sufferer, found\nlodgings for him, sent his own surgeon, and was constant in his visits\nto the convalescent. Thereafter the rise of Robert Carr was meteoric.\nKnighted, he became Viscount Rochester, a member of the Privy Council,\nthen Earl of Somerset, Knight of the Garter, all in a very few years. It\nwas in 1607 that he fell from his horse, under the King's nose. In 1613\nhe was at the height of his power in England.\n\nReturn we for a moment, however, to that day in the Whitehall tilt-yard.\nIt is related that one woman whose life and fate were to be bound with\nCarr's was in the ladies' gallery. It is very probable that a second\nwoman, whose association with the first did much to seal Carr's doom,\nwas also a spectator. If Frances Howard, as we read, showed distress\nover the painful mishap to the handsome Scots youth it is almost certain\nthat Anne Turner, with the quick eye she had for male comeliness and\nher less need for Court-bred restraint, would exhibit a sympathetic\nvolubility.\n\nFrances Howard was the daughter of that famous Elizabethan seaman Thomas\nHoward, Earl of Suffolk. On that day in September she would be just over\nfifteen years of age. It is said that she was singularly lovely. At that\nearly age she was already a wife, victim of a political marriage which,\nin the exercise of the ponderous cunning he called kingcraft, King James\nhad been at some pains to arrange. At the age of thirteen Frances had\nbeen married to Robert Devereux, third Earl of Essex, then but a year\nolder than herself. The young couple had been parted at the altar, the\ngroom being sent travelling to complete his growth and education, and\nFrances being returned to her mother and the semi-seclusion of the\nSuffolk mansion at Audley End.\n\nOf the two women, so closely linked in fate, the second is perhaps\nthe more interesting study. Anne Turner was something older than the\nCountess of Essex. In the various records of the strange piece of\nhistory which is here to be dealt with there are many allusions to a\nlong association between the two. Almost a foster-sister relationship\nseems to be implied, but actual detail is irritatingly absent. Nor is\nit clear whether Mrs Turner at the time of the tilt-yard incident\nhad embarked on the business activities which were to make her a much\nsought-after person in King James's Court. It is not to be ascertained\nwhether she was not already a widow at that time. We can only judge from\ncircumstantial evidence brought forward later.\n\nIn 1610, at all events, Mrs Turner was well known about the Court, and\nwas quite certainly a widow. Her husband had been a well-known medical\nman, one George Turner, a graduate of St John's College, Cambridge. He\nhad been a protege of Queen Elizabeth. Dying, this elderly husband of\nMistress Turner had left her but little in the way of worldly goods,\nbut that little the fair young widow had all the wit to turn to good\naccount. There was a house in Paternoster Row and a series of notebooks.\nLike many another physician of his time, George Turner had been a\ndabbler in more arts than that of medicine, an investigator in sciences\nother than pathology. His notebooks would appear to have contained more\nthan remedial prescriptions for agues, fevers, and rheums. There was,\nfor example, a recipe for a yellow starch which, says Rafael Sabatini,\nin his fine romance The Minion,[7] \"she dispensed as her own invention.\nThis had become so widely fashionable for ruffs and pickadills that of\nitself it had rendered her famous.\" One may believe, also, that most\nof the recipes for those \"perfumes, cosmetics, unguents and mysterious\npowders, liniments and lotions asserted to preserve beauty where it\nexisted, and even to summon it where it was lacking,\" were derived from\nthe same sources.\n\n\nThere is a temptation to write of Mistress Turner as forerunner of\nthat notorious Mme Rachel of whom, in his volume Bad Companions,[8] Mr\nRoughead has said the final and pawky word. Mme Rachel, in the middle of\nthe nineteenth century, founded her fortunes as a beauty specialist (?)\non a prescription for a hair-restorer given her by a kindly doctor.\nShe also 'invented' many a lotion and unguent for the preservation and\ncreation of beauty. But at about this point analogy stops. Both Rachel\nand her forerunner, Anne Turner, were scamps, and both got into serious\ntrouble--Anne into deeper and deadlier hot water than Rachel--but\nbetween the two women there is only superficial comparison. Rachel was a\nbotcher and a bungler, a very cobbler, beside Anne Turner.\n\n\nAnne, there is every cause for assurance, was in herself the best\nadvertisement for her wares. Rachel was a fat old hag. Anne, prettily\nfair, little-boned, and deliciously fleshed, was neat and elegant.\nThe impression one gets of her from all the records, even the most\nprejudiced against her, is that she was a very cuddlesome morsel indeed.\nShe was, in addition, demonstrably clever. Such a man of talent as Inigo\nJones supported the decoration of many of the masques he set on the\nstage with costumes of Anne's design and confection. Rachel could\nneither read nor write.\n\nIt is highly probable that Anne Turner made coin out of the notes which\nher late husband, so inquisitive of mind, had left on matters much more\noccult than the manufacture of yellow starch and skin lotions. \"It was\nalso rumoured,\" says Mr Sabatini, \"that she amassed gold in another and\nless licit manner: that she dabbled in fortune-telling and the arts of\ndivination.\" We shall see, as the story develops, that the rumour had\nsome foundation. The inquiring mind of the late Dr Turner had led him\ninto strange company, and his legacy to Anne included connexions more\nsombre than those in the extravagantly luxurious Court of King James.\n\nIn 1610 the elegant little widow was flourishing enough to be able to\nmaintain a lover in good style. This was Sir Arthur Mainwaring, member\nof a Cheshire family of good repute but of no great wealth. By him she\nhad three children. Mainwaring was attached in some fashion to the suite\nof the Prince of Wales, Prince Henry. And while the Prince's court at St\nJames's Palace was something more modest, as it was more refined, than\nthat of the King at Whitehall, position in it was not to be retained at\nease without considerable expenditure. It may be gauged, therefore, at\nwhat expense Anne's attachment to Mainwaring would keep her, and to what\nexercise of her talent and ambition her pride in it would drive her. And\nher pride was absolute. It would, says a contemporary diarist, \"make her\nfly at any pitch rather than fall into the jaws of want.\"[9]\n\n\n\nII\n\nIn his romance The Minion, Rafael Sabatini makes the first meeting of\nAnne Turner and the Countess of Essex occur in 1610 or 1611. With this\ndate Judge A. E. Parry, in his book The Overbury Mystery,[10] seems to\nagree in part. There is, however, warrant enough for believing that the\ntwo women had met long before that time. Anne Turner herself, pleading\nat her trial for mercy from Sir Edward Coke, the Lord Chief Justice, put\nforward the plea that she had been \"ever brought up with the Countess of\nEssex, and had been a long time her servant.\"[11] She also made the like\nextenuative plea on the scaffold.[12] Judge Parry seems to follow some\nof the contemporary writers in assuming that Anne was a spy in the pay\nof the Lord Privy Seal, the Earl of Northampton. If this was so there\nis further ground for believing that Anne and Lady Essex had earlier\ncontacts, for Northampton was Lady Essex's great-uncle. The longer\nassociation would go far in explaining the terrible conspiracy into\nwhich, from soon after that time, the two women so readily fell\ntogether--a criminal conspiracy, in which the reader may see something\nof the \"false nurse\" in Anne Turner and something of Jean Livingstone in\nFrances Howard, Lady Essex.\n\n\nIt was about this time, 1610-1611, that Lady Essex began to find herself\ninterested in the handsome Robert Carr, then Viscount Rochester. Having\nreached the mature age of eighteen, the lovely Frances had been brought\nby her mother, the Countess of Suffolk, to Court. Highest in the King's\nfavour, and so, with his remarkably good looks, his charm, and the\nelegant taste in attire and personal appointment which his new wealth\nallowed him lavishly to indulge, Rochester was by far the most brilliant\nfigure there. Frances fell in love with the King's minion.\n\nRochester, it would appear, did not immediately respond to the lady's\nadvances. They were probably too shy, too tentative, to attract\nRochester's attention. It is probable, also, that there were plenty of\nbeautiful women about the Court, more mature, more practised in the arts\nof coquetry than Frances, and very likely not at all 'blate'--as Carr\nand his master would put it--in showing themselves ready for conquest by\nthe King's handsome favourite.\n\nWhether the acquaintance of Lady Essex with Mrs Turner was of long\nstanding or not, it was to the versatile Anne that her ladyship turned\nas confidante. The hint regarding Anne's skill in divination will be\nremembered. Having regard to the period, and to the alchemistic nature\nof the goods that composed so much of Anne's stock-in-trade at the sign\nof the Golden Distaff, in Paternoster Row, it may be conjectured that\nthe love-lorn Frances had thoughts of a philtre.\n\nWith an expensive lover and children to maintain, to say nothing of her\nown luxurious habits, Anne Turner would see in the Countess's appeal a\nchance to turn more than one penny into the family exchequer. She was\ntoo much the opportunist to let any consideration of old acquaintance\ninterfere with working such a potential gold-mine as now seemed to lie\nopen to her pretty but prehensile fingers. Lady Essex was rich. She\nwas also ardent in her desire. The game was too big for Anne to play\nsingle-handed. A real expert in cozening, a master of guile, was wanted\nto exploit the opportunity to its limit.\n\nIt is a curious phenomenon, and one that constantly recurs in the\nhistory of cozenage, how people who live by spoof fall victims so\nreadily to spoofery. Anne Turner had brains. There is no doubt of it.\nApart from that genuine and honest talent in costume-design which made\nher work acceptable to such an outstanding genius as Inigo Jones, she\nlived by guile. But I have now to invite you to see her at the feet of\none of the silliest charlatans who ever lived. There is, of course, the\npossibility that Anne sat at the feet of this silly charlatan for what\nshe might learn for the extension of her own technique. Or, again, it\nmay have been that the wizard of Lambeth, whom she consulted in the Lady\nEssex affair, could provide a more impressive setting for spoof than she\nhad handy, or that they were simply rogues together. My trouble is to\nunderstand why, by the time that the Lady Essex came to her with her\nproblem, Anne had not exhausted all the gambits in flummery that were at\nthe command of the preposterous Dr Forman.\n\nThe connexion with Dr Forman was part of the legacy left Anne by Dr\nTurner. Her husband had been the friend and patron of Forman, so that\nby the time Anne had taken Mainwaring for her lover, and had borne him\nthree children, she must have had ample opportunity for seeing through\nthe old charlatan.\n\nAntony Weldon, the contemporary writer already quoted, is something\ntoo scurrilous and too apparently biased to be altogether a trustworthy\nauthority. He seems to have been the type of gossip (still to be met in\nLondon clubs) who can always tell with circumstance how the duchess came\nto have a black baby, and the exact composition of the party at which\nMidas played at 'strip poker.' But he was, like many of his kind, an\namusing enough companion for the idle moment, and his description of Dr\nForman is probably fairly close to the truth.\n\n\"This Forman,\" he says,\n\nwas a silly fellow who dwelt in Lambeth, a very silly fellow, yet had\nwit enough to cheat the ladies and other women, by pretending skill in\ntelling their fortunes, as whether they should bury their husbands, and\nwhat second husbands they should have, and whether they should enjoy\ntheir loves, or whether maids should get husbands, or enjoy their\nservants to themselves without corrivals: but before he would tell them\nanything they must write their names in his alphabetical book with\ntheir own handwriting. By this trick he kept them in awe, if they should\ncomplain of his abusing them, as in truth he did nothing else. Besides,\nit was believed, some meetings were at his house, wherein the art of the\nbawd was more beneficial to him than that of a conjurer, and that he was\na better artist in the one than in the other: and that you may know his\nskill, he was himself a cuckold, having a very pretty wench to his wife,\nwhich would say, she did it to try his skill, but it fared with him as\nwith astrologers that cannot foresee their own destiny.\n\n\nAnd here comes an addendum, the point of which finds confirmation\nelsewhere. It has reference to the trial of Anne Turner, to which we\nshall come later.\n\n\"I well remember there was much mirth made in the Court upon the showing\nof the book, for, it was reported, the first leaf my lord Cook [Coke,\nthe Lord Chief Justice] lighted on he found his own wife's name.\"\n\nWhatever Anne's reason for doing so, it was to this scortatory old scab\nthat she turned for help in cozening the fair young Countess. The devil\nknows to what obscene ritual the girl was introduced. There is evidence\nthat the thaumaturgy practised by Forman did not want for lewdness--as\nmagic of the sort does not to this day--and in this regard Master Weldon\ncannot be far astray when he makes our pretty Anne out to be the veriest\nbaggage.\n\nMagic or no magic, philtre or no philtre, it was not long before Lady\nEssex had her wish. The Viscount Rochester fell as desperately in love\nwith her as she was with him.\n\nThere was, you may be sure, no small amount of scandalous chatter in the\nCourt over the quickly obvious attachment the one to the other of this\nhandsome couple. So much of this scandalous chatter has found record by\nthe pens of contemporary and later gossip-writers that it is hard indeed\nto extract the truth. It is certain, however, that had the love between\nRobert Carr and Frances Howard been as chaste as ice, as pure as snow,\njealousy would still have done its worst in besmirching. It was not, if\nthe Rabelaisian trend in so much of Jacobean writing be any indication,\na particularly moral age. Few ages in history are. It was not, with\na reputed pervert as the fount of honour, a particularly moral Court.\nSince the emergence of the lovely young Countess from tutelage at Audley\nEnd there had been no lack of suitors for her favour. And when Frances\nso openly exhibited her preference for the King's minion there would be\nsome among those disappointed suitors who would whisper, greenly, that\nRochester had been granted that prisage which was the right of the\nabsent Essex, a right which they themselves had been quite ready to\nusurp. It is hardly likely that there would be complete abnegation of\nsalty gossip among the ladies of the Court, their Apollo being snatched\nby a mere chit of a girl.\n\nWhat relative happiness there may have been for the pair in their\nloving--it could not, in the hindrance there was to their free mating,\nhave been an absolute happiness--was shattered after some time by the\nreturn to England of the young husband. The Earl of Essex, now almost\ncome to man's estate, arrived to take up the position which his rank\nentitled him to expect in the Court, and to assume the responsibilities\nand rights which, he fancied, belonged to him as a married man. In\nrespect of the latter part of his intention he immediately found himself\nbalked. His wife, perhaps all the deeper in love with Rochester for this\nthreat to their happiness, declared that she had no mind to be held by\nthe marriage forced on her in infancy, and begged her husband to agree\nto its annulment.\n\nIt had been better for young Essex to have agreed at once. He would\nhave spared himself, ultimately, a great deal of humiliation through\nridicule. But he tried to enforce his rights as a husband, a proceeding\nthan which there is none more absurd should the wife prove obdurate. And\nprove obdurate his wife did. She was to be moved neither by threat nor\nby pleading. It was, you will notice, a comedy situation; husband\nnot perhaps amorous so much as the thwarted possessor of the\nunpossessable--wife frigid and a maid, as far, at least, as the husband\nwas concerned, and her weeping eyes turned yearningly elsewhere. A\ncomedy situation, yes, and at this distance almost farcical--but for\ncertain elements in it approaching tragedy.\n\nBadgered, not only by her husband but by her own relatives, scared no\ndoubt, certainly unhappy, unable for politic reasons to appeal freely\nto her beloved Robin, to whom might Frances turn but the helpful Turner?\nAnd to whom, having turned to pretty Anne, was she likely to be led but\nagain to the wizard of Lambeth?\n\nDr Forman had a heart for beauty in distress, but dissipating the\nardency of an exigent husband was a difficult matter compared with\nattracting that of a negligent lover. It was also much more costly. A\npowder there was, indeed, which, administered secretly by small regular\ndoses in the husband's food or drink, would soon cool his ardour,\nbut the process of manufacture and the ingredients were enormously\nexpensive. Frances got her powder.\n\nThe first dose was administered to Lord Essex just before his departure\nfrom a visit to his wife at Audley End. On his arrival back in London he\nwas taken violently ill, so ill that in the weeks he lay in bed his life\nwas despaired of. Only the intervention of the King's own physician, one\nSir Theodore Mayerne, would appear to have saved him.\n\nHer husband slowly convalescing, Lady Essex was summoned by her family\nback to London. In London, while Lord Essex mended in health, she was\nmuch in the company of her \"sweet Turner.\" In addition to the house\nin Paternoster Row the little widow had a pretty riverside cottage at\nHammersmith, and both were at the disposal of Lady Essex and her lover\nfor stolen meetings. Those meetings were put a stop to by the recovery\nof Lord Essex, and with his recovery his lordship exhibited a new mood\nof determination. Backed by her ladyship's family, he ordered her to\naccompany him to their country place of Chartley. Her ladyship had to\nobey.\n\nThe stages of the journey were marked by the nightly illness of his\nlordship. By the time they arrived at Chartley itself he was in a\ncondition little if at all less dangerous than that from which he had\nbeen rescued by the King's physician. His illness lasted for weeks, and\nduring this time her ladyship wrote many a letter to Anne Turner and to\nDr Forman. She was afraid his lordship would live. She was afraid his\nlordship would die. She was afraid she would lose the love of Rochester.\nShe begged Anne Turner and Forman to work their best magic for her aid.\nShe was afraid that if his lordship recovered the spells might prove\nuseless, that his attempts to assert his rights as a husband would begin\nagain, and that there, in the heart of the country and so far from any\nrefuge, they might take a form she would be unable to resist.\n\nHis lordship did recover. His attempts to assert his rights as a husband\ndid begin again. The struggle between them, Frances constant in her\nobduracy, lasted several months. Her obstinacy wore down his. At long\nlast he let her go.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nIf the fate that overtook Frances Howard and Rochester, and with them\nAnne Turner and many another, is to be properly understood, a brief word\non the political situation in England at this time will be needed--or,\nrather, a word on the political personages, with their antagonisms.\n\nNext in closeness to the King's ear after Rochester, and perhaps more\ntrusted as a counsellor by that \"wise fool,\" there had been Robert\nCecil, Lord Salisbury, for a long time First Secretary of State. But\nabout the time when Lady Essex finally parted with her husband Cecil\ndied, depriving England of her keenest brain and the staunchest heart\nin her causes. If there had been no Rochester the likeliest man in the\nkingdom to succeed to the power and offices of Cecil would have been the\nEarl of Northampton, uncle of Lord Suffolk, who was the father of Lady\nEssex. Northampton, as stated, held the office of Lord Privy Seal.\n\nThe Howard family had done the State great service in the past. Its\npresent representatives, Northampton and Suffolk, were anxious to do\nthe State great service, as they conceived it, in the future. They were,\nhowever, Catholics in all but open acknowledgment, and as such were\nopposed by the Protestants, who had at their head Prince Henry. This was\nan opposition that they might have stomached. It was one that they might\neven have got over, for the Prince and his father, the King, were not\nthe best of friends. The obstacle to their ambitions, and one they found\nhard to stomach, was the upstart Rochester. And even Rochester would\nhardly have stood in their way had his power in the Council depended on\nhis own ability. The brain that directed Robert Carr belonged to another\nman. This was Sir Thomas Overbury.\n\nOn the death of Cecil the real contenders for the vacant office of First\nSecretary of State--the highest office in the land--were not the wily\nNorthampton and the relatively unintelligent Rochester, but the subtle\nNorthampton and the quite as subtle, and perhaps more spacious-minded,\nThomas Overbury. There was, it will be apprehended, a possible weakness\non the Overbury side. The gemel-chain, like that of many links, is\nmerely as strong as its weakest member. Overbury had no approach to the\nKing save through the King's favourite. Rochester could have no real\nweight with the King, at least in affairs of State, except what he\nborrowed from Overbury. Divided, the two were powerless. No, more than\nthat, there had to be no flaw in their linking.\n\nThe wily Northampton, one may be certain, was fully aware of this\npossible weakness in the combination opposed to his advancement. He\nwould be fully aware, that is, that it was there potentially; but when\nhe began, as his activities would indicate, to work for the creation\nof that flaw in the relationship between Rochester and Overbury it is\nunlikely that he knew the flaw had already begun to develop. Unknown to\nhim, circumstance already had begun to operate in his favour.\n\nOverbury was Rochester's tutor in more than appertained to affairs of\nState. It is more than likely that in Carr's wooing of Lady Essex he\nhad held the role of Cyrano de Bergerac, writing those gracefully turned\nletters and composing those accomplished verses which did so much to\naugment and give constancy to her ladyship's love for Rochester. It is\ncertain, at any rate, that Overbury was privy to all the correspondence\npassing between the pair, and that even such events as the supplying by\nForman and Mrs Turner of that magic powder, and the Countess's use of it\nupon her husband, were well within his knowledge.\n\nWhile the affair between his alter ego and the Lady Essex might be\nlooked upon as mere dalliance, a passionate episode likely to wither\nwith a speed equal to that of its growth, Overbury, it is probable,\nfound cynical amusement in helping it on. But when, as time went on,\nthe lady and her husband separated permanently, and from mere talk of a\npetition for annulment of the Essex marriage that petition was presented\nin actual form to the King, Overbury saw danger. Northampton was\nbacking the petition. If it succeeded Lady Essex would be free to marry\nRochester. And the marriage, since Northampton was not the man to give\nexcept in the expectation of plenty, would plant the unwary Rochester\non the hearth of his own and Overbury's enemies. With Rochester in the\nHoward camp there would be short shrift for Thomas Overbury. There would\nbe, though Rochester in his infatuation seemed blind to the fact, as\nshort a shrift as the Howards could contrive for the King's minion.\n\nIn that march of inevitability which marks all real tragedy the road\nthat is followed forks ever and again with an 'if.' And we who, across\nthe distance of time, watch with a sort of Jovian pity the tragic\npuppets in their folly miss this fork and that fork on their road\nof destiny select, each according to our particular temperaments, a\nparticular 'if' over which to shake our heads. For me, in this story of\nRochester, Overbury, Frances Howard, and the rest, the point of tragedy,\nthe most poignant of the issues, is the betrayal by Robert Carr of\nOverbury's friendship. Though this story is essentially, or should be,\nthat of the two women who were linked in fate with Rochester and his\ncoadjutor, I am constrained to linger for a moment on that point.\n\nOverbury's counsel had made Carr great. With nothing but his good looks\nand his personal charm, his only real attributes, Carr had been no more\nthan King James's creature. James, with all the pedantry, the laboured\ncunning, the sleezy weaknesses of character that make him so detestable,\nwas yet too shrewd to have put power in the hands of the mere minion\nthat Carr would have been without the brain of Overbury to guide him.\nOf himself Carr was the 'toom tabard' of earlier parlance in his native\ncountry, the 'stuffed shirt' of a later and more remote generation. But\nbeyond the coalition for mutual help that existed between Overbury\nand Carr, an arrangement which might have thrived on a basis merely\nmaterial, there was a deep and splendid friendship. 'Stuffed shirt' or\nnot, Robert Carr was greatly loved by Overbury. Whatever Overbury may\nhave thought of Carr's mental attainments, he had the greatest faith in\nhis loyalty as a friend. And here lies the terrible pity in that 'if' of\nmy choice. The love between the two men was great enough to have saved\nthem both. It broke on the weakness of Carr.\n\nOverbury was aware that, honestly presented, the petition by Lady Essex\nfor the annulment of her marriage had little chance of success. But for\nthe obstinacy of Essex it might have been granted readily enough. He\nhad, however, as we have seen, forced her to live with him as his wife,\nin appearance at least, for several months in the country. There now\nwould be difficulty in putting forward the petition on the ground of\nnon-consummation of the marriage.\n\nIt was, nevertheless, on this ground that the petition was brought\nforward. But the non-consummation was not attributed, as it might have\nbeen, to the continued separation that had begun at the altar; the\nreason given was the impotence of the husband. Just what persuasion\nNorthampton and the Howards used on Essex to make him accept this\nhumiliating implication it is hard to imagine, but by the time the\ncoarse wits of the period had done with him Essex was amply punished in\nridicule for his primary obstinacy.\n\nSir Thomas Overbury, well informed though he usually was, must have been\na good deal in the dark regarding the negotiations which had brought the\nnullity suit to this forward state. He had warned Rochester so frankly\nof the danger into which the scheme was likely to lead him that they had\nquarrelled and parted. If Rochester had been frank with his friend, if,\non the ground of their friendship, he had appealed to him to set aside\nhis prejudice, it might well have been that the tragedy which ensued\nwould have been averted. Enough evidence remains to this day of\nOverbury's kindness for Robert Carr, there is enough proof of the man's\nabounding resource and wit, to give warrant for belief that he would\nhave had the will, as he certainly had the ability, to help his\nfriend. Overbury was one of the brightest intelligences of his age. Had\nRochester confessed the extent of his commitment with Northampton there\nis little doubt that Overbury could and would have found a way whereby\nRochester could have attained his object (of marriage with Frances\nHoward), and this without jeopardizing their mutual power to the Howard\nmenace.\n\nIn denying the man who had made him great the complete confidence which\ntheir friendship demanded Rochester took the tragically wrong path\non his road of destiny. But the truth is that when he quarrelled with\nOverbury he had already betrayed the friendship. He had already embarked\non the perilous experiment of straddling between two opposed camps. It\nwas an experiment that he, least of all men, had the adroitness to bring\noff. He was never in such need of Overbury's brain as when he aligned\nhimself in secret with Overbury's enemies.\n\nIt is entirely probable that in linking up with Northampton Rochester\nhad no mind to injure his friend. The bait was the woman he loved.\nWithout Northampton's aid the nullity suit could not be put forward, and\nwithout the annulment there could be no marriage for him with Frances\nHoward. But he had no sooner joined with Northampton than the very\nprocesses against which Overbury had warned him were begun. Rochester\nwas trapped, and with him Overbury.\n\nFor the success of the suit, in Northampton's view, Overbury knew too\nmuch. It was a view to which Rochester was readily persuaded; or it was\none which he was easily frightened into accepting. From that to joining\nin a plot for being rid of Overbury was but a step. Grateful, perhaps,\nfor the undoubted services that Overbury had rendered him, Rochester\nwould be eager enough to find his quondam friend employment. If that\nemployment happened to take Overbury out of the country so much the\nbetter. At one time the King, jealous as a woman of the friendship\nexisting between his favourite and Overbury, had tried to shift the\nlatter out of the way by an offer of the embassy in Paris. It was an\noffer Rochester thought, that he might cause to be repeated. The idea\nwas broached to Overbury. That shrewd individual, of course, saw through\nthe suggestion to the intention behind it, but he was at a loss for an\noutlet for his talents, having left Rochester's employ, and he believed\nwithout immodesty that he could do useful work as ambassador in Paris.\n\nOverbury was offered an embassy--but in Muscovy. He had no mind to bury\nhimself in Russia, and he refused the offer on the ground of ill-health.\nBy doing this he walked into the trap prepared for him. Northampton had\nforeseen the refusal when he promoted the offer on its rearranged terms.\nThe King, already incensed against Overbury for some hints at knowledge\nof facts liable to upset the Essex nullity suit, pretended indignation\nat the refusal. Overbury unwarily repeated it before the Privy Council.\nThat was what Northampton wanted. The refusal was high contempt of the\nKing's majesty. Sir Thomas Overbury was committed to the Tower. He might\nhave talked in Paris, or have written from Muscovy. He might safely do\neither in the Tower--where gags and bonds were so readily at hand.\n\nDid Rochester know of the springe set to catch Overbury? The answer\nto the question, whether yes or no, hardly matters. Since he was gull\nenough to discard the man whose brain had lifted him from a condition in\nwhich he was hardly better than the King's lap-dog, he was gull enough\nto be fooled by Northampton. Since he valued the friendship of that\nhonest man so little as to consort in secret with his enemies, he was\nknave enough to have been party to the betrayal. Knave or fool--what\ndoes it matter? He was so much of both that, in dread of what Sir Thomas\nmight say or do to thwart the nullity suit, he let his friend rot in the\nTower for months on end, let him sicken and nearly die several times,\nwithout a move to free him. He did this to the man who had trusted him\nimplicitly, a man that--to adapt Overbury's own words from his last\npoignant letter to Rochester--he had \"more cause to love... yea, perish\nfor.. . rather than see perish.\"\n\nIt is not given to every man to have that greater love which will make\nhim lay down his life for a friend, but it is the sheer poltroon and\ncraven who will watch a friend linger and expire in agony without\nlifting a finger to save him. Knave or fool--what does it matter when\neither is submerged in the coward?\n\n\n\nIV\n\nOverbury lay in the Tower five months. The commission appointed to\nexamine into the Essex nullity suit went into session three weeks after\nhe was imprisoned. There happened to be one man in the commission who\ncared more to be honest than to humour the King. This was the Archbishop\nAbbot. The King himself had prepared the petition. It was a task that\ndelighted his pedantry, and his petition was designed for immediate\nacceptance. But such was Abbot's opposition that in two or three months\nthe commission ended with divided findings.\n\nMeantime Overbury in the Tower had been writing letters. He had been\ntalking to visitors. As time went on, and Rochester did nothing to bring\nabout his enlargement, his writings and sayings became more threatening\nRochester's attitude was that patience was needed. In time he would\nbring the King to a more clement view of Sir Thomas's offending, and\nhe had no doubt that in the end he would be able to secure the prisoner\nboth freedom and honourable employment.\n\nOverbury had been consigned to the Tower in April. In June he complained\nof illness. Rochester wrote to him in sympathetic terms, sending him a\npowder that he himself had found beneficial, and made his own physician\nvisit the prisoner.\n\nBut the threats which Overbury, indignant at his betrayal by Rochester,\nmade by speech and writing were becoming common property in the city\nand at Court One of Overbury's visitors who had made public mention of\nOverbury's knowledge of facts likely to blow upon the Essex suit was\narrested on the orders of Northampton. In the absence of the King and\nRochester from London the old Earl was acting as Chief Secretary of\nState--thus proving Overbury to have been a true prophet. Northampton\nissued orders to the Tower that Overbury was to be closely confined,\nthat his man Davies was to be dismissed, and that he was to be denied\nall visitors. The then Lieutenant of the Tower, one Sir William Wade,\nwas deprived of his position on the thinnest of pretexts, and, on the\nrecommendation of Sir Thomas Monson, Master of the Armoury, an elderly\ngentleman from Lincolnshire, Sir Gervase Elwes, was put in his place.\n\nFrom that moment Sir Thomas Overbury was permitted no communication with\nthe outer world, save by letter to Lord Rochester and for food that was\nbrought him, as we shall presently see, at the instance of Mrs Turner.\n\nIn place of his own servant Davies Sir Thomas was allowed the services\nof an under-keeper named Weston, appointed at the same time as Sir\nGervase Elwes. This man, it is perhaps important to note, had at one\ntime been servant to Mrs Turner.\n\nThe alteration in the personnel of the Tower was almost immediately\nfollowed by severe illness on the part of the prisoner. The close\nconfinement to which he was subjected, with the lack of exercise, could\nhardly have been the cause of such a violent sickness. It looked more as\nif it had been brought about by something he had eaten or drunk. By this\ntime the conviction he had tried to resist, that Rochester was meanly\nsacrificing him, became definite. Overbury is hardly to be blamed if he\ncame to a resolution to be revenged on his one-time friend by bringing\nhim to utter ruin. King James had been so busy in the Essex nullity\nsuit, had gone to such lengths to carry it through, that if it could\nbe wrecked by the production of the true facts he would be bound to\nsacrifice Rochester to save his own face. Sir Thomas had an accurate\nknowledge of the King's character. He knew the scramble James was\ncapable of making in a difficulty that involved his kingly dignity, and\nwhat little reck he had of the faces he trod on in climbing from a pit\nof his own digging. By a trick Overbury contrived to smuggle a letter\nthrough to the honest Archbishop Abbot, in which he declared his\npossession of facts that would non-suit the nullity action, and begged\nto be summoned before the commission.\n\nOverbury was getting better of the sickness which had attacked him when\nsuddenly it came upon him again. This time he made no bones about saying\nthat he had been poisoned.\n\nEven at the last Overbury had taken care to give Rochester a chance to\nprove his fidelity. He contrived that the delivery of the letter to the\nArchbishop of Canterbury should be delayed until just before the nullity\ncommission, now augmented by members certain to vote according to the\nKing's desire, was due to sit again. The Archbishop carried Overbury's\nletter to James, and insisted that Overbury should be heard. The King,\noutward stickler that he was for the letter of the law, had to agree.\n\nOn the Thursday of the week during which the commission was sitting\nOverbury was due to be called. He was ill, but not so ill as he had\nbeen. On the Tuesday he was visited by the King's physician. On the\nWednesday he was dead.\n\nNow, before we come to examine those evidences regarding Overbury's\ndeath that were to be brought forward in the series of trials of\nlater date, that series which was to be known as \"the Great Oyer of\nPoisoning,\" it may be well to consider what effect upon the Essex\nnullity suit Overbury's appearance before the commission might have had.\nIt may be well to consider what reason Rochester had for keeping his\nfriend in close confinement in the Tower, what reason there was for\npermitting Northampton to impose such cruelly rigorous conditions of\nimprisonment.\n\nThe nullity suit succeeded. A jury of matrons was impanelled, and made\nan examination of the lady appellant. Its evidence was that she was\nvirgo intacta. Seven out of the twelve members of the packed commission\nvoted in favour of the sentence of nullity.\n\nThe kernel of the situation lies in the verdict of the jury of matrons.\nHer ladyship was declared to be a maid. If in the finding gossips and\nscandal-mongers found reason for laughter, and decent enough people\ncause for wonderment, they are hardly to be blamed. If Frances Howard\nwas a virgin, what reason was there for fearing anything Overbury might\nhave said? What knowledge had he against the suit that put Rochester\nand the Howards in such fear of him that they had to confine him in the\nTower under such miserable conditions? In what was he so dangerous that\nhe had to be deprived of his faithful Davies, that he had to be put in\nthe care of a Tower Lieutenant specially appointed? The evidence given\nbefore the commission can still be read in almost verbatim report. It is\ncompletely in favour of the plea of Lady Essex. Sir Thomas Overbury's,\nhad he given evidence, would have been the sole voice against the suit.\nIf he had said that in his belief the association of her ladyship with\nRochester had been adulterous there was the physical fact adduced by the\njury of matrons to confute him. And being confuted in that, what might\nhe have said that would not be attributed to rancour on his part? That\nher ladyship, with the help of Mrs Turner and the wizard of Lambeth, had\npractised magic upon her husband, giving him powders that went near to\nkilling him? That she had lived in seclusion for several months with her\nhusband at Chartley, and that the non-consummation of the marriage\nwas due, not to the impotence of the husband, but to refusal to him of\nmarital rights on the part of the wife because of her guilty love for\nRochester? His lordship of Essex was still alive, and there was abundant\nevidence before the court that there had been attempt to consummate\nthe marriage. Whatever Sir Thomas might have said would have smashed as\nevidence on that one fact. Her ladyship was a virgin.\n\nWhat did Sir Thomas Overbury know that made every one whose interest\nit was to further the nullity suit so scared of him--Rochester, her\nladyship, Northampton, the Howards, the King himself?\n\nSir Thomas Overbury was much too cool-minded, too intelligent, to\nindulge in threats unless he was certain of the grounds, and solid upon\nthem, upon which he made those threats. He had too great a knowledge of\naffairs not to know that the commission would be a packed one, too great\nan acquaintance with the strategy of James to believe that his lonely\nevidence, unless of bombshell nature, would have a chance of carrying\nweight in a court of his Majesty's picking. And, then, he was of too big\na mind to put forward evidence which would have no effect but that of\naffording gossip for the scandal-mongers, and the giving of which would\nmake him appear to be actuated by petty spite. He had too great a sense\nof his own dignity to give himself anything but an heroic role. Samson\nhe might play, pulling the pillars of the temple together to involve\nhis enemies, with himself, in magnificent and dramatic ruin. But\nIachimo--no.\n\nIn the welter of evidence conflicting with apparent fact which was given\nbefore the commission and in the trials of the Great Oyer, in the\nmass of writing both contemporary and of later days round the Overbury\nmystery, it is hard indeed to land upon the truth. Feasible solution\nis to be come upon only by accepting a not too pretty story which\nis retailed by Antony Weldon. He says that the girl whom the jury of\nmatrons declared to be virgo intacta was so heavily veiled as to be\nunidentifiable through the whole proceedings, and that she was not Lady\nEssex at all, but the youthful daughter of Sir Thomas Monson.\n\nMrs Turner, we do know, was very much a favourite with the ladies of\nSir Thomas Monson's family. Gossip Weldon has a funny, if lewd, story\nto tell of high jinks indulged in by the Monson women and Mrs Turner in\nwhich Symon, Monson's servant, played an odd part. This Symon was also\nemployed by Mrs Turner to carry food to Overbury in the Tower. If the\nsubstitution story has any truth in it it might well have been a Monson\ngirl who played the part of the Countess. But, of course, a Monson girl\nmay have been chosen by the inventors to give verisimilitude to the\nsubstitution story, simply because the family was friendly with Turner,\nand the tale of the lewd high jinks with Symon added to make it seem\nmore likely that old Lady Monson would lend herself to such a plot.\n\nIf there was such a plot it is not at all unlikely that Overbury knew of\nit. If there was need of such a scheme to bolster the nullity\npetition it would have had to be evolved while the petition was being\nplanned--that is, a month or two before the commission went first into\nsession. At that time Overbury was still Rochester's secretary, still\nRochester's confidant; and if such a scheme had been evolved for getting\nover an obstacle so fatal to the petition's success it was not in\nRochester's nature to have concealed it from Overbury, the two men still\nbeing fast friends. Indeed, it may have been Overbury who pointed\nout the need there would be for the Countess to undergo physical\nexamination, and it may have been on the certainty that her ladyship\ncould not do so that Overbury rested so securely--as he most apparently\ndid, beyond the point of safety--in the idea that the suit was bound to\nfail. It is legitimate enough to suppose, along this hypothesis,\nthat this substitution plot was the very matter on which the two men\nquarrelled.\n\nThat Overbury had knowledge of some such essential secret as this is\nmanifest in the enmity towards the man which Lady Essex exhibited, even\nwhen he lay, out of the way of doing harm, in the Tower. It is hard\nto believe that an innocent girl of twenty, conscious of her virgin\nchastity, in mere fear of scandal which she knew would be baseless,\ncould pursue the life of a man with the venom that, as we shall\npresently see, Frances Howard used towards Overbury through Mrs Turner.\n\n\n\nV\n\nAs a preliminary to his marriage with Frances Howard, Rochester was\ncreated Earl of Somerset, and had the barony of Brancepeth bestowed\non him by the King. Overbury was three months in his grave when the\nmarriage was celebrated in the midst of the most extravagant show and\nentertainment.\n\nThe new Earl's power in the kingdom was never so high as at this time.\nIt was, indeed, at its zenith. Decline was soon to set in. It will not\nserve here to follow the whole process of decay in the King's favour\nthat Somerset was now to experience. There was poetic justice in his\ndownfall. With hands all about him itching to bring him to the ground,\nhe had not the brain for the giddy heights. If behind him there had been\nthe man whose guidance had made him sure-footed in the climb he might\nhave survived, flourishing. But the man he had consigned to death had\nbeen more than half of him, had been, indeed, his substance. Alone,\nwith the power Overbury's talents had brought him, Somerset was bound to\nfail. The irony of it is that his downfall was contrived by a creature\nof his own raising.\n\nSomerset had appointed Sir Ralph Winwood to the office of First\nSecretary of State. In that office word came to Winwood from Brussels\nthat new light had been thrown on the mysterious death of Sir Thomas\nOverbury. Winwood investigated in secret. An English lad, one Reeves,\nan apothecary's assistant, thinking himself dying, had confessed at\nFlushing that Overbury had been poisoned by an injection of corrosive\nsublimate. Reeves himself had given the injection on the orders of his\nmaster, Loubel, the apothecary who had attended Overbury on the day\nbefore his death. Winwood sought out Loubel, and from him went to Sir\nGervase Elwes. The story he was able to make from what he had from the\ntwo men he took to the King. From this beginning rose up the Great\nOyer of Poisoning. The matter was put into the hands of the Lord Chief\nJustice, Sir Edward Coke.\n\nThe lad Reeves, whose confession had started the matter, was either dead\nor dying abroad, and was so out of Coke's reach. But the man who had\nhelped the lad to administer the poisoned clyster, the under-keeper\nWeston, was at hand. Weston was arrested, and examined by Coke.\nThe statement Coke's bullying drew from the man made mention of one\nFranklin, another apothecary, as having supplied a phial which Sir\nGervase Elwes had taken and thrown away. Weston had also received\nanother phial by Franklin's son from Lady Essex. This also Sir Gervase\nhad taken and destroyed. Then there had been tarts and jellies supplied\nby Mrs Turner.\n\nCoke had Mrs Turner and Franklin arrested, and after that Sir Gervase\nwas taken as an accessory, and on his statement that he had employed\nWeston on Sir Thomas Monson's recommendation Sir Thomas also was roped\nin. He maintained that he had been told to recommend Weston by Lady\nEssex and the Earl of Northampton.\n\nThe next person to be examined by Coke was the apothecary Loubel, he\nwho had attended Overbury on the day before his death. Though in his\nconfession the lad Reeves said that he had been given money and sent\nabroad by Loubel, this was a matter that Coke did not probe. Loubel told\nCoke that he had given Overbury nothing but the physic prescribed by Sir\nTheodore Mayerne, the King's physician, and that in his opinion Overbury\nhad died of consumption. With this evidence Coke was very strangely\ncontent--or, at least, content as far as Loubel was concerned, for this\nwitness was not summoned again.\n\nOther persons were examined by Coke, notably Overbury's servant\nDavies and his secretary Payton. Their statements served to throw some\nsuspicion on the Earl of Somerset.\n\nBut if all the detail of these examinations were gone into we should\nnever be done. Our concern is with the two women involved, Anne Turner\nand the Countess of Somerset, as we must now call her. I am going to\nquote, however, two paragraphs from Rafael Sabatini's romance The Minion\nthat I think may explain why it is so difficult to come to the truth of\nthe Overbury mystery. They indicate how it was smothered by the way in\nwhich Coke rough-handled justice throughout the whole series of trials.\n\n\nOn October 19th, at the Guildhall, began the Great Oyer of Poisoning, as\nCoke described it, with the trial of Richard Weston.\n\nThus at the very outset the dishonesty of the proceedings is apparent.\nWeston was an accessory. Both on his own evidence and that of Sir\nGervase Elwes, besides the apothecary's boy in Flushing, Sir Thomas\nOverbury had died following upon an injection prepared by Loubel.\nTherefore Loubel was the principal, and only after Loubel's conviction\ncould the field have been extended to include Weston and the others. But\nLoubel was tried neither then nor subsequently, a circumstance regarded\nby many as the most mysterious part of what is known as the Overbury\nmystery, whereas, in fact, it is the clue to it. Nor was the evidence of\nthe coroner put in, so that there was no real preliminary formal proof\nthat Overbury had been poisoned at all.\n\n\nHere Mr Sabatini is concerned to develop one of the underlying arguments\nof his story--namely, that it was King James himself who had ultimately\nengineered the death of Sir Thomas Overbury. It is an argument which I\nwould not attempt to refute. I do not think that Mr Sabatini's acumen\nhas failed him in the least. But the point for me in the paragraphs is\nthe indication they give of how much Coke did to suppress all evidence\nthat did not suit his purpose.\n\nWeston's trial is curious in that at first he refused to plead. It is\nthe first instance I have met with in history of a prisoner standing\n'mute of malice.' Coke read him a lecture on the subject, pointing out\nthat by his obstinacy he was making himself liable to peine forte et\ndure, which meant that order could be given for his exposure in an open\nplace near the prison, extended naked, and to have weights laid upon\nhim in increasing amount, he being kept alive with the \"coarsest bread\nobtainable and water from the nearest sink or puddle to the place of\nexecution, that day he had water having no bread, and that day he had\nbread having no water.\" One may imagine with what grim satisfaction Coke\nladled this out. It had its effect on Weston.\n\nHe confessed that Mrs Turner had promised to give him a reward if he\nwould poison Sir Thomas Overbury. In May she had sent him a phial of\n\"rosalgar,\" and he had received from her tarts poisoned with mercury\nsublimate. He was charged with having, at Mrs Turner's instance, joined\nwith an apothecary's boy in administering an injection of corrosive\nsublimate to Sir Thomas Overbury, from which the latter died. Coke's\nconduct of the case obscures just how much Weston admitted, but, since\nit convinced the jury of Weston's guilt, the conviction served finely\nfor accusation against Mrs Turner.\n\nTwo days after conviction Weston was executed at Tyburn.\n\nThe trial of Anne Turner began in the first week of November. It would\nbe easy to make a pathetic figure of the comely little widow as she\nstood trembling under Coke's bullying, but she was, in actual fact,\nhardly deserving of pity. It is far from enlivening to read of Coke's\nhandling of the trial, and it is certain that Mrs Turner was condemned\non an indictment and process which to-day would not have a ghost of\na chance of surviving appeal, but it is perfectly plain that Anne was\nparty to one of the most vicious poisoning plots ever engineered.\n\nWe have, however, to consider this point in extenuation for her. It is\nalmost certain that in moving to bring about the death of Overbury she\nhad sanction, if only tacit, from the Earl of Northampton. By the time\nthat the Great Oyer began Northampton was dead. Two years had elapsed\nfrom the death of Overbury. It would be quite clear to Anne that, in\nthe view of the powerful Howard faction, the elimination of Overbury was\npolitically desirable. It should be remembered, too, that she lived in\na period when assassination, secret or by subverted process of justice,\nwas a commonplace political weapon. Public executions by methods cruel\nand even obscene taught the people to hold human life at small value,\nand hardened them to cruelties that made poisoning seem a mercy. It is\nnot at all unlikely that, though her main object may have been to help\nforward the plans of her friend the Countess, Anne considered herself a\nplotter in high affairs of State.\n\nThe indictment against her was that she had comforted, aided, and\nabetted Weston--that is to say, she was made an accessory. If, however,\nas was accused, she procured Weston and Reeves to administer the\npoisonous injection she was certainly a principal, and as such should\nhave been tried first or at the same time as Weston. But Weston was\nalready hanged, and so could not be questioned. His various statements\nwere used against her unchallenged, or, at least, when challenging them\nwas useless.\n\nThe indictment made no mention of her practices against the Earl of\nEssex, but from the account given in the State Trials it would seem\nthat evidence on this score was used to build the case against her. Her\nrelations with Dr Forman, now safely dead, were made much of. She and\nthe Countess of Essex had visited the charlatan and had addressed him as\n\"Father.\" Their reason for visiting, it was said, was that \"by force\nof magick he should procure the then Viscount of Rochester to love the\nCountess and Sir Arthur Mainwaring to love Mrs Turner, by whom she had\nthree children.\" Letters from the Countess to Turner were read. They\nrevealed the use on Lord Essex of those powders her ladyship had been\ngiven by Forman. The letters had been found by Forman's wife in a packet\namong Forman's possessions after his death. These, with others and with\nseveral curious objects exhibited in court, had been demanded by Mrs\nTurner after Forman's demise. Mrs Turner had kept them, and they were\nfound in her house.\n\nAs indicating the type of magic practised by Forman these objects are\nof interest. Among other figures, probably nothing more than dolls of\nFrench make, there was a leaden model of a man and woman in the act of\ncopulation, with the brass mould from which it had been cast. There\nwas a black scarf ornamented with white crosses, papers with cabalistic\nsigns, and sundry other exhibits which appear to have created\nsuperstitious fear in the crowd about the court. It is amusing to note\nthat while those exhibits were being examined one of the scaffolds\nerected for seating gave way or cracked ominously, giving the crowd a\nthorough scare. It was thought that the devil himself, raised by\nthe power of those uncanny objects, had got into the Guildhall.\nConsternation reigned for quite a quarter of an hour.\n\nThere was also exhibited Forman's famous book of signatures, in which\nCoke is supposed to have encountered his own wife's name on the first\npage.\n\nFranklin, apothecary, druggist, necromancer, wizard, and born liar, had\nconfessed to supplying the poisons intended for use upon Overbury. He\ndeclared that Mrs Turner had come to him from the Countess and asked him\nto get the strongest poisons procurable. He \"accordingly bought seven:\nviz., aqua fortis, white arsenic, mercury, powder of diamonds, lapis\ncostitus, great spiders, cantharides.\" Franklin's evidence is a palpable\ntissue of lies, full of statements that contradict each other, but it is\nlikely enough, judging from facts elicited elsewhere, that his list\nof poisons is accurate. Enough poison passed from hand to hand to have\nslain an army.\n\nMention is made by Weldon of the evidence given by Symon, servant to Sir\nThomas Monson, who had been employed by Mrs Turner to carry a jelly and\na tart to the Tower. Symon appears to have been a witty fellow. He was,\n\"for his pleasant answer,\" dismissed by Coke.\n\n\nMy lord told him: \"Symon, you have had a hand in this poisoning\nbusiness----\"\n\n\"No, my good lord, I had but a finger in it, which almost cost me my\nlife, and, at the best, cost me all my hair and nails.\" For the truth\nwas that Symon was somewhat liquorish, and finding the syrup swim from\nthe top of the tart as he carried it, he did with his finger skim it\noff: and it was believed, had he known what it had been, he would not\nhave been his taster at so dear a rate.\n\nCoke, with his bullying methods and his way of acting both as judge\nand chief prosecutor, lacks little as prototype for the later Judge\nJeffreys. Even before the jury retired he was at pains to inform Mrs\nTurner that she had the seven deadly sins: viz., \"a whore, a bawd, a\nsorcerer, a witch, a papist, a felon, and a murderer, the daughter\nof the devil Forman.\"[13] And having given such a Christian example\nthroughout the trial, he besought her \"to repent, and to become the\nservant of Jesus Christ, and to pray Him to cast out the seven devils.\"\nIt was upon this that Anne begged the Lord Chief Justice to be merciful\nto her, putting forward the plea of having been brought up with the\nCountess of Essex, and of having been \"a long time her servant.\" She\ndeclared that she had not known of poison in the things that were sent\nto Sir Thomas Overbury.\n\n\nThe jury's retirement was not long-drawn. They found her guilty.\n\nSays Weldon:\n\nThe Wednesday following she was brought from the sheriff's in a coach to\nNewgate and there was put into a cart, and casting money often among the\npeople as she was carried to Tyburn, where she was executed, and whither\nmany men and women of fashion followed her in coaches to see her die.\n\nHer speeches before execution were pious, like most speeches of the\nsort, and \"moved the spectators to great pity and grief for her.\" She\nagain related \"her breeding with the Countess of Somerset,\" and pleaded\nfurther of \"having had no other means to maintain her and her children\nbut what came from the Countess.\" This last, of course, was less than\nthe truth. Anne was not so indigent that she needed to take to poisoning\nas a means of supporting her family. She also said \"that when her hand\nwas once in this business she knew the revealing of it would be her\noverthrow.\"\n\nIn more than one account written later of her execution she is said to\nhave worn a ruff and cuffs dressed with the yellow starch which she had\nmade so fashionable, and it is maintained that this association made the\nstarch thereafter unpopular. It is forgotten that with Anne the recipe\nfor the yellow starch probably was lost. Moreover, the elaborate ruff\nwas then being put out of fashion by the introduction of the much more\ncomfortable lace collar. In any case, \"There is no truth,\" writes Judge\nParry, in the old story[14] that Coke ordered her to be executed in the\nyellow ruff she had made the fashion and so proudly worn in Court. What\ndid happen, according to Sir Simonds d'Ewes, was that the hangman, a\ncoarse ruffian with a distorted sense of humour, dressed himself in\nbands and cuffs of yellow colour, but no one heeded his ribaldry; only\nin after days none of either sex used the yellow starch, and the fashion\ngrew generally to be detested.\n\n\nPretty much, I should think, as the tall 'choker' became detested within\nthe time of many of us. After Mrs Turner Sir Gervase Elwes was brought\nto trial as an accessory. The only evidence against him was that of the\nliar Franklin, who asserted that Sir Gervase had been in league with the\nCountess. It was plain, however, both from Weston's statements and from\nSir Gervase's own, that the Lieutenant of the Tower had done his very\nbest to defeat the Turner-Essex-Northampton plot for the poisoning of\nOverbury, throwing away the \"rosalgar\" and later draughts, as well\nas substituting food from his own kitchen for that sent in by Turner.\n\"Although it must have been clear that if any of what was alleged\nagainst him had been true Overbury's poisoning would never have taken\nfive months to accomplish, he was sentenced and hanged.\"[15]\n\n\nThis, of course, was a glaring piece of injustice, but Coke no doubt had\nhis instructions. Weston, Mrs Turner, Elwes, and, later, Franklin had\nto be got out of the way, so that they could not be confronted with the\nchief figure against whom the Great Oyer was directed, and whom it was\ndesigned to pull down, Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset--and with him his\nwife. Just as much of the statements and confessions of the prisoners in\nthe four preliminary trials was used by Coke as suited his purpose. It\nis pointed out by Amos, in his Great Oyer of Poisoning, that a large\nnumber of the documents appertaining to the Somerset trial show\ncorrections and apparent glosses in Coke's own handwriting, and that\neven the confessions on the scaffold of some of the convicted are\nholographs by Coke. As a sample of the suppression of which Coke was\nguilty I may put forward the fact that Somerset's note to his own\nphysician, Craig, asking him to visit Overbury, was not produced.\nYet great play was made by Coke of this visit against Somerset. Wrote\nSomerset to Craig, \"I pray you let him have your best help, and as much\nof your company as he shall require.\"\n\nIt was never proved that it was Anne Turner and Lady Essex who corrupted\nthe lad Reeves, who with Weston administered the poisoned clyster that\nmurdered Overbury. Nothing was done at all to absolve the apothecary\nLoubel, Reeves's master, of having prepared the poisonous injection, nor\nSir Theodore Mayerne, the King's physician, of having been party to its\npreparation. Yet it was demonstrably the injection that killed Overbury\nif he was killed by poison at all. It is certain that the poisons sent\nto the Tower by Turner and the Countess did not save in early instances,\nget to Overbury at all--Elwes saw to that--or Overbury must have died\nmonths before he did die.\n\nAccording to Weldon, who may be supposed to have witnessed the trials,\nFranklin confessed \"that Overbury was smothered to death, not poisoned\nto death, though he had poison given him.\" And Weldon goes on to make\nthis curious comment:\n\n\nHere was Coke glad, how to cast about to bring both ends together, Mrs\nTurner and Weston being already hanged for killing Overbury with poison;\nbut he, being the very quintessence of the law, presently informs the\njury that if a man be done to death with pistols, poniards, swords,\nhalter, poison, etc., so he be done to death, the indictment is good if\nhe be but indicted for any of those ways. But the good lawyers of those\ntimes were not of that opinion, but did believe that Mrs Turner was\ndirectly murthered by my lord Coke's law as Overbury was without any\nlaw.\n\n\nThough you will look in vain through the reports given in the State\nTrials for any speech of Coke to the jury in exactly these terms, it\nmight be just as well to remember that the transcriptions from which\nthe Trials are printed were prepared UNDER Coke's SUPERVISION, and that\nthey, like the confessions of the convicted, are very often in his own\nhandwriting.\n\nAt all events, even on the bowdlerized evidence that exists, it is plain\nthat Anne Turner should have been charged only with attempted murder.\nOf that she was manifestly guilty and, according to the justice of the\ntime, thoroughly deserved to be hanged. The indictment against her was\nfaulty, and the case against her as full of holes as a colander. Her\ntrial was 'cooked' in more senses than one.\n\nIt was some seven months after the execution of Anne Turner that the\nCountess of Essex was brought to trial. This was in May. In December,\nwhile virtually a prisoner under the charge of Sir William Smith at Lord\nAubigny's house in Blackfriars, she had given birth to a daughter. In\nMarch she had been conveyed to the Tower, her baby being handed over to\nthe care of her mother, the Countess of Suffolk. Since the autumn of\nthe previous year she had not been permitted any communication with her\nhusband, nor he with her. He was already lodged in the Tower when she\narrived there.\n\nOn a day towards the end of May she was conveyed by water from the Tower\nto Westminster Hall. The hall was packed to suffocation, seats being\npaid for at prices which would turn a modern promoter of a world's\nheavyweight-boxing-championship fight green with envy. Her judges were\ntwenty-two peers of the realm, with the Lord High Steward, the Lord\nChief Justice, and seven judges at law. It was a pageant of colour,\nin the midst of which the woman on trial, in her careful toilette,\nconsisting of a black stammel gown, a cypress chaperon or black crepe\nhood in the French fashion, relieved by touches of white in the cuffs\nand ruff of cobweb lawn, struck a funereal note. Preceded by the\nheadsman carrying his axe with its edge turned away from her, she was\nconducted to the bar by the Lieutenant of the Tower. The indictment was\nread to her, and at its end came the question: \"Frances Howard, Countess\nof Somerset, how sayest thou? Art thou guilty of this felony and murder\nor not guilty?\"\n\nThere was a hushed pause for a moment; then came the low-voiced answer:\n\"Guilty.\"\n\nSir Francis Bacon, the Attorney-General--himself to appear in the same\nplace not long after to answer charges of bribery and corruption--now\naddressed the judges. His eloquent address was a commendation of the\nCountess's confession, and it hinted at royal clemency.\n\nIn answer to the formal demand of the Clerk of Arraigns if she had\nanything to say why judgment of death should not be given against\nher the Countess made a barely audible plea for mercy, begging their\nlordships to intercede for her with the King. Then the Lord High\nSteward, expressing belief that the King would be moved to mercy,\ndelivered judgment. She was to be taken thence to the Tower of London,\nthence to the place of execution, where she was to be hanged by the neck\nuntil she was dead--and might the Lord have mercy on her soul.\n\nThe attendant women hastened to the side of the swaying woman. And now\nthe halbardiers formed escort about her, the headsman in front, with the\nedge of his axe turned towards her in token of her conviction, and she\nwas led away.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nIt is perfectly clear that the Countess of Somerset was led to confess\non the promise of the King's mercy. It is equally clear that she did not\nknow what she was confessing to. Whatever might have been her conspiracy\nwith Anne Turner it is a practical certainty that it did not result in\nthe death of Thomas Overbury. There is no record of her being allowed\nany legal advice in the seven months that had elapsed since she\nhad first been made a virtual prisoner. She had been permitted no\ncommunication with her husband. For all she knew, Overbury might indeed\nhave died from the poison which she had caused to be sent to the Tower\nin such quantity and variety. And she went to trial at Westminster\nguilty in conscience, her one idea being to take the blame for having\nbrought about the murder of Overbury, thinking by that to absolve her\nhusband of any share in the plot. She could not have known that her plea\nof guilty would weaken Somerset's defence. The woman who could go to\nsuch lengths in order to win her husband was unlikely to have done\nanything that might put him in jeopardy. One can well imagine with what\nfierceness she would have fought her case had she thought that by doing\nso she could have helped the man she loved.\n\nBut Frances Howard, no less than her accomplice Anne Turner, was the\nvictim of a gross subversion of justice. That she was guilty of a cruel\nand determined attempt to poison Overbury is beyond question, and, being\nguilty of that, she was thoroughly deserving of the fate that overcame\nAnne Turner, but that at the last she was allowed to escape. Her\nconfession, however, shackled Somerset at his trial. It put her at the\nKing's mercy. Without endangering her life Somerset dared not come to\nthe crux of his defence, which would have been to demand why Loubel had\nbeen allowed to go free, and why the King's physician, Mayerne, had not\nbeen examined. To prevent Somerset from asking those questions, which\nmust have given the public a sufficient hint of King James's share in\nthe murder of Overbury, two men stood behind the Earl all through his\ntrial with cloaks over their arms, ready to muffle him. But, whatever\nmay be said of Somerset, the prospect of the cloaks would not have\nstopped him from attempting those questions. He had sent word to King\nJames that he was \"neither Gowrie nor Balmerino,\" those two earlier\nvictims of James's treachery. The thing that muffled him was the threat\nto withdraw the promised mercy to his Countess. And so he kept silent,\nto be condemned to death as his wife had been, and to join her in the\nTower.\n\nFive weary years were the couple to eat their hearts out there, their\ndeath sentences remitted, before their ultimate banishment far from the\nCourt to a life of impoverished obscurity in the country. Better for\nthem, one would think, if they had died on Tower Green. It is hard to\nimagine that the dozen years or so which they were to spend together\ncould contain anything of happiness for them--she the confessed would-be\npoisoner, and he haunted by the memory of that betrayal of friendship\nwhich had begun the process of their double ruin. Frances Howard died\nin 1632, her husband twenty-three years later. The longer lease of life\ncould have been no blessing to the fallen favourite.\n\nThere is a portrait of Frances Howard in the National Portrait Gallery\nby an unknown artist. It is an odd little face which appears above\nthe elaborate filigree of the stiff lace ruff and under the\ncarefully dressed bush of dark brown hair. With her gay jacket of red\ngold-embroidered, and her gold-ornamented grey gown, cut low to show the\nvalley between her young breasts, she looks like a child dressed up. If\nthere is no great indication of the beauty which so many poets shed ink\nover there is less promise of the dire determination which was to pursue\na man's life with cruel poisons over several months. It is, however, a\nnarrow little face, and there is a tight-liddedness about the eyes which\nin an older woman might indicate the bigot. Bigot she proved herself\nto be, if it be bigotry in a woman to love a man with an intensity that\nwill not stop at murder in order to win him. That is the one thing that\nmay be said for Frances Howard. She did love Robert Carr. She loved him\nto his ruin.\n\n\n\n\nIV: -- A MODEL FOR MR HOGARTH\n\nOn a Sunday, the 5th of February, 1733, there came toddling into that\nnarrow passage of the Temple known as Tanfield Court an elderly lady by\nthe name of Mrs Love. It was just after one o'clock of the afternoon.\nThe giants of St Dunstan's behind her had only a minute before rapped\nout the hour with their clubs.\n\nMrs Love's business was at once charitable and social. She was going,\nby appointment made on the previous Friday night, to eat dinner with\na frail old lady named Mrs Duncomb, who lived in chambers on the third\nfloor of one of the buildings that had entry from the court. Mrs Duncomb\nwas the widow of a law stationer of the City. She had been a widow for a\ngood number of years. The deceased law stationer, if he had not left her\nrich, at least had left her in fairly comfortable circumstances. It\nwas said about the environs that she had some property, and this fact,\ncombined with the other that she was obviously nearing the end of life's\njourney, made her an object of melancholy interest to the womenkind of\nthe neighbourhood.\n\nMrs Duncomb was looked after by a couple of servants. One of them, Betty\nHarrison, had been the old lady's companion for a lifetime. Mrs\nDuncomb, described as \"old,\" was only sixty.[16] Her weakness and bodily\ncondition seem to have made her appear much older. Betty, then, also\ndescribed as \"old,\" may have been of an age with her mistress, or even\nolder. She was, at all events, not by much less frail. The other servant\nwas a comparatively new addition to the establishment, a fresh little\ngirl of about seventeen, Ann (or Nanny) Price by name.\n\n\nMrs Love climbed the three flights of stairs to the top landing. It\nsurprised her, or disturbed her, but little that she found no signs of\nlife on the various floors, because it was, as we have seen, a Sunday.\nThe occupants of the chambers of the staircase, mostly gentlemen\nconnected in one way or another with the law, would be, she knew abroad\nfor the eating of their Sunday dinners, either at their favourite\ntaverns or at commons in the Temple itself. What did rather disturb\nkindly Mrs Love was the fact that she found Mrs Duncomb's outer door\nclosed--an unwonted fact--and it faintly surprised her that no odour of\ncooking greeted her nostrils.\n\nMrs Love knocked. There was no reply. She knocked, indeed, at intervals\nover a period of some fifteen minutes, still obtaining no response. The\ndisturbed sense of something being wrong became stronger and stronger in\nthe mind of Mrs Love.\n\nOn the night of the previous Friday she had been calling upon Mrs\nDuncomb, and she had found the old lady very weak, very nervous, and\nvery low in spirits. It had not been a very cheerful visit all round,\nbecause the old maidservant, Betty Harrison, had also been far from\nwell. There had been a good deal of talk between the old women of dying,\na subject to which their minds had been very prone to revert. Besides\nMrs Love there were two other visitors, but they too failed to cheer the\nold couple up. One of the visitors, a laundress of the Temple called\nMrs Oliphant, had done her best, poohpoohing such melancholy talk, and\nattributing the low spirits in which the old women found themselves\nto the bleakness of the February weather, and promising them that they\nwould find a new lease of life with the advent of spring. But Mrs Betty\nespecially had been hard to console.\n\n\"My mistress,\" she had said to cheerful Mrs Oliphant, \"will talk of\ndying. And she would have me die with her.\"\n\nAs she stood in considerable perturbation of mind on the cheerless\nthird-floor landing that Sunday afternoon Mrs Love found small matter\nfor comfort in her memory of the Friday evening. She remembered that old\nMrs Duncomb had spoken complainingly of the lonesomeness which had\ncome upon her floor by the vacation of the chambers opposite her on\nthe landing. The tenant had gone a day or two before, leaving the rooms\nempty of furniture, and the key with a Mr Twysden.\n\nMrs. Love, turning to view the door opposite to that on which she had\nbeen rapping so long and so ineffectively, had a shuddery feeling that\nshe was alone on the top of the world.\n\nShe remembered how she had left Mrs Duncomb on the Friday night. Mrs\nOliphant had departed first, accompanied by the second visitor, one\nSarah Malcolm, a charwoman who had worked for Mrs Duncomb up to the\nprevious Christmas, and who had called in to see how her former employer\nwas faring. An odd, silent sort of young woman this Sarah, good-looking\nin a hardfeatured sort of way, she had taken but a very small part in\nthe conversation, but had sat staring rather sullenly into the fire by\nthe side of Betty Harrison, or else casting a flickering glance about\nthe room. Mrs Love, before following the other two women downstairs, had\nhelped the ailing Betty to get Mrs Duncomb settled for the night. In the\ndim candle-light and the faint glow of the fire that scarce illumined\nthe wainscoted room the high tester-bed of the old lady, with its\ncurtains, had seemed like a shadowed catafalque, an illusion nothing\nlessened by the frail old figure under the bedclothing.\n\nIt came to the mind of Mrs Love that the illness manifesting itself in\nBetty on the Friday night had worsened. Nanny, she imagined, must have\ngone abroad on some errand. The old servant, she thought, was too ill to\ncome to the door, and her voice would be too weak to convey an answer to\nthe knocking. Mrs Love, not without a shudder for the chill feeling of\nthat top landing, betook herself downstairs again to make what inquiry\nshe might. It happened that she met one of her fellow-visitors of the\nFriday night, Mrs Oliphant.\n\nMrs Oliphant was sympathetic, but could not give any information. She\nhad seen no member of the old lady's establishment that day. She could\nonly advise Mrs Love to go upstairs again and knock louder.\n\nThis Mrs Love did, but again got no reply. She then evolved the theory\nthat Betty had died during the night, and that Nanny, Mrs Duncomb being\nconfined to bed, had gone to look for help, possibly from her sister,\nand to find a woman who would lay out the body of the old servant. With\nthis in her mind Mrs Love descended the stairs once more, and went to\nlook for another friend of Mrs Duncomb's, a Mrs Rhymer.\n\nMrs Rhymer was a friend of the old lady's of some thirty years'\nstanding. She was, indeed, named as executrix in Mrs Duncomb's will. Mrs\nLove finding her and explaining the situation as she saw it, Mrs Rhymer\nat once returned with Mrs Love to Tanfield Court.\n\nThe two women ascended the stairs, and tried pushing the old lady's\ndoor. It refused to yield to their efforts. Then Mrs Love went to the\nstaircase window that overlooked the court, and gazed around to see if\nthere was anyone about who might help. Some distance away, at the door,\nwe are told, \"of my Lord Bishop of Bangor,\" was the third of Friday\nnight's visitors to Mrs Duncomb, the charwoman named Sarah Malcolm. Mrs\nLove hailed her.\n\n\"Prithee, Sarah,\" begged Mrs Love, \"go and fetch a smith to open Mrs\nDuncomb's door.\"\n\n\"I will go at all speed,\" Sarah assured her, with ready willingness, and\noff she sped. Mrs Love and Mrs Rhymer waited some time. Sarah came back\nwith Mrs Oliphant in tow, but had been unable to secure the services of\na locksmith. This was probably due to the fact that it was a Sunday.\n\nBy now both Mrs Love and Mrs Rhymer had become deeply apprehensive, and\nthe former appealed to Mrs Oliphant. \"I do believe they are all dead,\nand the smith is not come!\" cried Mrs Love. \"What shall we do, Mrs\nOliphant?\"\n\nMrs Oliphant, much younger than the others, seems to have been a woman\nof resource. She had from Mr Twysden, she said, the key of the vacant\nchambers opposite to Mrs Duncomb's. \"Now let me see,\" she continued, \"if\nI cannot get out of the back chamber window into the gutter, and so into\nMrs Duncomb's apartment.\"\n\nThe other women urged her to try.[17] Mrs Oliphant set off, her heels\nechoing in the empty rooms. Presently the waiting women heard a\npane snap, and they guessed that Mrs Oliphant had broken through Mrs\nDuncomb's casement to get at the handle. They heard, through the door,\nthe noise of furniture being moved as she got through the window. Then\ncame a shriek, the scuffle of feet. The outer door of Mrs Duncomb's\nchambers was flung open. Mrs Oliphant, ashen-faced, appeared on the\nlanding. \"God! Oh, gracious God!\" she cried. \"They're all murdered!\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nAll four women pressed into the chambers. All three of the women\noccupying them had been murdered. In the passage or lobby little Nanny\nPrice lay in her bed in a welter of blood, her throat savagely cut. Her\nhair was loose and over her eyes, her clenched hands all bloodied about\nher throat. It was apparent that she had struggled desperately for\nlife. Next door, in the dining-room, old Betty Harrison lay across the\npress-bed in which she usually slept. Being in the habit of keeping her\ngown on for warmth, as it was said, she was partially dressed. She had\nbeen strangled, it seemed, \"with an apron-string or a pack-thread,\" for\nthere was a deep crease about her neck and the bruised indentations as\nof knuckles. In her bedroom, also across her bed, lay the dead body of\nold Mrs Duncomb. There had been here also an attempt to strangle, an\nunnecessary attempt it appeared, for the crease about the neck was very\nfaint. Frail as the old lady had been, the mere weight of the murderer's\nbody, it was conjectured, had been enough to kill her.\n\nThese pathological details were established on the arrival later of\nMr Bigg, the surgeon, fetched from the Rainbow Coffee-house near by by\nFairlow, one of the Temple porters. But the four women could see enough\nfor themselves, without the help of Mr Bigg, to understand how death\nhad been dealt in all three cases. They could see quite clearly also\nfor what motive the crime had been committed. A black strong-box, with\npapers scattered about it, lay beside Mrs Duncomb's bed, its lid forced\nopen. It was in this box that the old lady had been accustomed to keep\nher money.\n\nIf any witness had been needed to say what the black box had contained\nthere was Mrs Rhymer, executrix under the old lady's will. And if Mrs.\nRhymer had been at any need to refresh her memory regarding the contents\nopportunity had been given her no farther back than the afternoon of the\nprevious Thursday. On that day she had called upon Mrs Duncomb to take\ntea and to talk affairs. Three or four years before, with her rapidly\nincreasing frailness, the old lady's memory had begun to fail. Mrs\nRhymer acted for her as a sort of unofficial curator bonis, receiving\nher money and depositing it in the black box, of which she kept the key.\n\nOn the Thursday, old Betty and young Nanny being sent from the room, the\nold lady had told Mrs Rhymer that she needed some money--a guinea. Mrs\nRhymer had gone through the solemn process of opening the black box,\nand, one must suppose--old ladies nearing their end being what they\nare--had been at need to tell over the contents of the box for the\nhundredth time, just to reassure Mrs Duncomb that she thoroughly\nunderstood the duties she had agreed to undertake as executrix\n\nAt the top of the box was a silver tankard. It had belonged to Mrs\nDuncomb's husband. In the tankard was a hundred pounds. Beside the\ntankard lay a bag containing guinea pieces to the number of twenty or\nso. This was the bag that Mrs Rhymer had carried over to the old lady's\nchair by the fire, in order to take from it the needed guinea.\n\nThere were some half-dozen packets of money in the box, each sealed\nwith black wax and set aside for particular purposes after Mrs Duncomb's\ndeath. Other sums, greater in quantity than those contained in the\npackets, were earmarked in the same way. There was, for example, twenty\nguineas set aside for the old lady's burial, eighteen moidores to meet\nunforeseen contingencies, and in a green purse some thirty or forty\nshillings, which were to be distributed among poor people of Mrs\nDuncomb's acquaintance. The ritual of telling over the box contents, if\nsomething ghostly, had had its usual effect of comforting the old lady's\nmind. It consoled her to know that all arrangements were in order for\nher passing in genteel fashion to her long home, that all the decorums\nof respectable demise would be observed, and that \"the greatest of\nthese\" would not be forgotten. The ritual over, the black box was closed\nand locked, and on her departure Mrs Rhymer had taken away the key as\nusual.\n\nThe motive for the crime, as said, was plain. The black box had been\nforced, and there was no sign of tankard, packets, green purse, or bag\nof guineas.\n\nThe horror and distress of the old lady's friends that Sunday afternoon\nmay better be imagined than described. Loudest of the four, we are told,\nwas Sarah Malcolm. It is also said that she was, however, the coolest,\nkeen to point out the various methods by which the murderers (for the\ncrime to her did not look like a single-handed effort) could have got\ninto the chambers. She drew attention to the wideness of the kitchen\nchimney and to the weakness of the lock in the door to the vacant rooms\non the other side of the landing. She also pointed out that, since the\nbolt of the spring-lock of the outer door to Mrs Duncomb's rooms had\nbeen engaged when they arrived, the miscreants could not have used that\nexit.\n\nThis last piece of deduction on Sarah's part, however, was made rather\nnegligible by experiments presently carried out by the porter, Fairlow,\nwith the aid of a piece of string. He showed that a person outside the\nshut door could quite easily pull the bolt to on the inside.\n\nThe news of the triple murder quickly spread, and it was not long before\na crowd had collected in Tanfield Court, up the stairs to Mrs. Duncomb's\nlanding, and round about the door of Mrs Duncomb's chambers. It did not\ndisperse until the officers had made their investigations and the bodies\nof the three victims had been removed. And even then, one may be sure,\nthere would still be a few of those odd sort of people hanging about\nwho, in those times as in these, must linger on the scene of a crime\nlong after the last drop of interest has evaporated.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTwo further actors now come upon the scene. And for the proper grasping\nof events we must go back an hour or two in time to notice their\nactivities.\n\nThey are a Mr Gehagan, a young Irish barrister, and a friend of his\nnamed Kerrel.[18] These young men occupy chambers on opposite sides\nof the same landing, the third floor, over the Alienation Office in\nTanfield Court.\n\n\nMr Gehagan was one of Sarah Malcolm's employers. That Sunday morning at\nnine she had appeared in his rooms to do them up and to light the fire.\nWhile Gehagan was talking to Sarah he was joined by his friend Kerrel,\nwho offered to stand him some tea. Sarah was given a shilling and sent\nout to buy tea. She returned and made the brew, then remained about\nthe chambers until the horn blew, as was then the Temple custom, for\ncommons. The two young men departed. After commons they walked for a\nwhile in the Temple Gardens, then returned to Tanfield Court.\n\nBy this time the crowd attracted by the murder was blocking up the\ncourt, and Gehagan asked what was the matter. He was told of the murder,\nand he remarked to Kerrel that the old lady had been their charwoman's\nacquaintance.\n\nThe two friends then made their way to a coffee-house in Covent Garden.\nThere was some talk there of the murder, and the theory was advanced by\nsome one that it could have been done only by some laundress who knew\nthe chambers and how to get in and out of them. From Covent Garden,\ntowards night, Gehagan and Kerrel went to a tavern in Essex Street, and\nthere they stayed carousing until one o'clock in the morning, when they\nleft for the Temple. They were not a little astonished on reaching their\ncommon landing to find Kerrel's door open, a fire burning in the\ngrate of his room, and a candle on the table. By the fire, with a dark\nriding-hood about her head, was Sarah Malcolm. To Kerrel's natural\nquestion of what she was doing there at such an unearthly hour she\nmuttered something about having things to collect. Kerrel then,\nreminding her that Mrs Duncomb had been her acquaintance, asked her if\nanyone had been \"taken up\" for the murder.\n\n\"That Mr Knight,\" Sarah replied, \"who has chambers under her, has been\nabsent two or three days. He is suspected.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Kerrel, remembering the theory put forward in the\ncoffee-house, and made suspicious by her presence at that strange hour,\n\"nobody that was acquainted with Mrs Duncomb is wanted here until the\nmurderer is discovered. Look out your things, therefore, and begone!\"\n\nKerrel's suspicion thickened, and he asked his friend to run downstairs\nand call up the watch. Gehagan ran down, but found difficulty in opening\nthe door below, and had to return. Kerrel himself went down then, and\ncame back with two watchmen. They found Sarah in the bedroom at a chest\nof drawers, in which she was turning over some linen that she claimed\nto be hers. The now completely suspicious Kerrel went to his closet, and\nnoticed that two or three waistcoats were missing from a portmanteau.\nHe asked Sarah where they were; upon which Sarah, with an eye to the\nwatchmen and to Gehagan, begged to be allowed to speak with him alone.\n\nKerrel refused, saying he could have no business with her that was\nsecret.\n\nSarah then confessed that she had pawned the missing waistcoats for two\nguineas, and begged him not to be angry. Kerrel asked her why she had\nnot asked him for money. He could readily forgive her for pawning the\nwaistcoats, but, having heard her talk of Mrs Lydia Duncomb, he was\nafraid she was concerned with the murder. A pair of earrings were found\nin the drawers, and these Sarah claimed, putting them in her corsage. An\nodd-looking bundle in the closet then attracted Kerrel's attention, and\nhe kicked it, and asked Sarah what it was. She said it was merely dirty\nlinen wrapped up in an old gown. She did not wish it exposed. Kerrel\nmade further search, and found that other things were missing. He told\nthe watch to take the woman and hold her strictly.\n\nSarah was led away. Kerrel, now thoroughly roused, continued his search,\nand he found underneath his bed another bundle. He also came upon some\nbloodstained linen in another place, and in a close-stool a silver\ntankard, upon the handle of which was a lot of dried blood.\n\nKerrel's excitement passed to Gehagan, and the two of them went at\nspeed downstairs yelling for the watch. After a little the two watchmen\nreappeared, but without Sarah. They had let her go, they said, because\nthey had found nothing on her, and, besides, she had not been charged\nbefore a constable.\n\nOne here comes upon a recital by the watchmen which reveals the\nextraordinary slackness in dealing with suspect persons that\ncharacterized the guardians of the peace in London in those times. They\nhad let the woman go, but she had come back. Her home was in Shoreditch,\nshe said, and rather than walk all that way on a cold and boisterous\nnight she had wanted to sit up in the watch-house. The watchmen refused\nto let her do this, but ordered her to \"go about her business,\" advising\nher sternly at the same time to turn up again by ten o'clock in the\nmorning. Sarah had given her word, and had gone away.\n\nOn hearing this story Kerrel became very angry, threatening the two\nwatchmen, Hughes and Mastreter, with Newgate if they did not pick her\nup again immediately. Upon this the watchmen scurried off as quickly as\ntheir age and the cumbrous nature of their clothing would let them.\nThey found Sarah in the company of two other watchmen at the gate of\nthe Temple. Hughes, as a means of persuading her to go with them more\neasily, told her that Kerrel wanted to speak with her, and that he was\nnot angry any longer. Presently, in Tanfield Court, they came on the two\nyoung men carrying the tankard and the bloodied linen. This time it was\nGehagan who did the talking. He accused Sarah furiously, showing her the\ntankard. Sarah attempted to wipe the blood off the tankard handle with\nher apron. Gehagan stopped her.\n\nSarah said the tankard was her own. Her mother had given it her, and she\nhad had it for five years. It was to get the tankard out of pawn that\nshe had taken Kerrel's waistcoats, needing thirty shillings. The blood\non the handle was due to her having pricked a finger.\n\nWith this began the series of lies Sarah Malcolm put up in her defence.\nShe was hauled into the watchman's box and more thoroughly searched. A\ngreen silk purse containing twenty-one guineas was found in the bosom of\nher dress. This purse Sarah declared she had found in the street, and as\nan excuse for its cleanliness, unlikely with the streets as foul as they\nwere at that age and time of year, said she had washed it. Both bundles\nof linen were bloodstained. There was some doubt as to the identity of\nthe green purse. Mrs Rhymer, who, as we have seen, was likelier than\nanyone to recognize it, would not swear it was the green purse that had\nbeen in Mrs Duncomb's black box. There was, however, no doubt at all\nabout the tankard. It had the initials \"C. D.\" engraved upon it, and\nwas at once identified as Mrs Duncomb's. The linen which Sarah had\nbeen handling in Mr Kerrel's drawer was said to be darned in a way\nrecognizable as Mrs Duncomb's. It had lain beside the tankard and the\nmoney in the black box.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nThere was, it will be seen, but very little doubt of Sarah Malcolm's\nguilt. According to the reports of her trial, however, she fought\nfiercely for her life, questioning the witnesses closely. Some of them,\nsuch as could remember small points against her, but who failed in\nrecollection of the colour of her dress or of the exact number of the\ncoins said to be lost, she vehemently denounced.\n\nOne of the Newgate turnkeys told how some of the missing money was\ndiscovered. Being brought from the Compter to Newgate, Sarah happened to\nsee a room in which debtors were confined. She asked the turnkey, Roger\nJohnson, if she could be kept there. Johnson replied that it would cost\nher a guinea, but that from her appearance it did not look to him as if\nshe could afford so much. Sarah seems to have bragged then, saying that\nif the charge was twice or thrice as much she could send for a friend\nwho would pay it. Her attitude probably made the turnkey suspicious.\nAt any rate, after Sarah had mixed for some time with the felons in the\nprison taproom, Johnson called her out and, lighting the way by use of a\nlink, led her to an empty room.\n\n\"Child,\" he said, \"there is reason to suspect that you are guilty of\nthis murder, and therefore I have orders to search you.\" He had, he\nadmitted, no such orders. He felt under her arms; whereupon she started\nand threw back her head. Johnson clapped his hand on her head and felt\nsomething hard. He pulled off her cap, and found a bag of money in her\nhair.\n\n\"I asked her,\" Johnson said in the witness-box, \"how she came by it,\nand she said it was some of Mrs Duncomb's money. 'But, Mr Johnson,' says\nshe, 'I'll make you a present of it if you will keep it to yourself, and\nlet nobody know anything of the matter. The other things against me\nare nothing but circumstances, and I shall come well enough off. And\ntherefore I only desire you to let me have threepence or sixpence a\nday till the sessions be over; then I shall be at liberty to shift for\nmyself.'\"\n\nTo the best of his knowledge, said this turnkey, having told the money\nover, there were twenty moidores, eighteen guineas, five broad pieces,\na half-broad piece, five crowns, and two or three shillings. He\nthought there was also a twenty-five-shilling piece and some others,\ntwenty-three-shilling pieces. He had sealed them up in the bag, and\nthere they were (producing the bag in court).\n\nThe court asked how she said she had come by the money.\n\nJohnson's answer was that she had said she took the money and the bag\nfrom Mrs Duncomb, and that she had begged him to keep it secret. \"My\ndear,\" said this virtuous gaoler, \"I would not secrete the money for the\nworld.\n\n\"She told me, too,\" runs Johnson's recorded testimony, \"that she had\nhired three men to swear the tankard was her grandmother's, but could\nnot depend on them: that the name of one was William Denny, another was\nSmith, and I have forgot the third. After I had taken the money away she\nput a piece of mattress in her hair, that it might appear of the same\nbulk as before. Then I locked her up and sent to Mr Alstone, and told\nhim the story. 'And,' says I, 'do you stand in a dark place to be\nwitness of what she says, and I'll go and examine her again.\"'\n\nSarah interrupted: \"I tied my handkerchief over my hair to hide the\nmoney, but Buck,[19] happening to see my hair fall down, he told\nJohnson; upon which Johnson came to see me and said, 'I find the cole's\nplanted in your hair. Let me keep it for you and let Buck know nothing\nabout it.' So I gave Johnson five broad pieces and twenty-two guineas,\nnot gratis, but only to keep for me, for I expected it to be returned\nwhen sessions was over. As to the money, I never said I took it from\nMrs Duncomb; but he asked me what they had to rap against me. I told him\nonly a tankard. He asked me if it was Mrs Duncomb's, and I said yes.\"\n\n\nThe Court: \"Johnson, were those her words: 'This is the money and bag\nthat I took'?\"\n\nJohnson: \"Yes, and she desired me to make away with the bag.\"\n\nJohnson's evidence was confirmed in part by Alstone, another officer of\nthe prison. He said he told Johnson to get the bag from the prisoner, as\nit might have something about it whereby it could be identified. Johnson\ncalled the girl, while Alstone watched from a dark corner. He saw Sarah\ngive Johnson the bag, and heard her ask him to burn it. Alstone also\ndeposed that Sarah told him (Alstone) part of the money found on her was\nMrs Duncomb's.\n\nThere is no need here to enlarge upon the oddly slack and casual\nconditions of the prison life of the time as revealed in this evidence.\nIt will be no news to anyone who has studied contemporary criminal\nhistory. There is a point, however, that may be considered here, and\nthat is the familiarity it suggests on the part of Sarah with prison\nconditions and with the cant terms employed by criminals and the people\nhandling them.\n\nSarah, though still in her earliest twenties,[20] was known already--if\nnot in the Temple--to have a bad reputation. It is said that her closest\nfriends were thieves of the worst sort. She was the daughter of an\nEnglishman, at one time a public official in a small way in Dublin. Her\nfather had come to London with his wife and daughter, but on the death\nof the mother had gone back to Ireland. He had left his daughter behind\nhim, servant in an ale-house called the Black Horse.\n\n\nSarah was a fairly well-educated girl. At the ale-house, however, she\nformed an acquaintance with a woman named Mary Tracey, a dissolute\ncharacter, and with two thieves called Alexander. Of these three\ndisreputable people we shall be hearing presently, for Sarah tried to\nimplicate them in this crime which she certainly committed alone. It is\nsaid that the Newgate officers recognized Sarah on her arrival. She had\noften been to the prison to visit an Irish thief, convicted for stealing\nthe pack of a Scots pedlar.\n\nIt will be seen from Sarah's own defence how she tried to implicate\nTracey and the two Alexanders:\n\n\"I freely own that my crimes deserve death; I own that I was accessory\nto the robbery, but I was innocent of the murder, and will give an\naccount of the whole affair.\n\n\"I lived with Mrs Lydia Duncomb about three months before she was\nmurdered. The robbery was contrived by Mary Tracey, who is now in\nconfinement, and myself, my own vicious inclinations agreeing with hers.\nWe likewise proposed to rob Mr Oakes in Thames Street. She came to me at\nmy master's, Mr Kerrel's chambers, on the Sunday before the murder\nwas committed; he not being then at home, we talked about robbing Mrs\nDuncomb. I told her I could not pretend to do it by myself, for I should\nbe found out. 'No,' says she, 'there are the two Alexanders will help\nus.' Next day I had seventeen pounds sent me out of the country, which\nI left in Mr Kerrel's drawers. I met them all in Cheapside the following\nFriday, and we agreed on the next night, and so parted.\n\n\"Next day, being Saturday, I went between seven and eight in the evening\nto see Mrs Duncomb's maid, Elizabeth Harrison, who was very bad. I\nstayed a little while with her, and went down, and Mary Tracey and the\ntwo Alexanders came to me about ten o'clock, according to appointment.\"\n\nOn this statement the whole implication of Tracey and the Alexanders by\nSarah stands or falls. It falls for the reason that the Temple porter\nhad seen no stranger pass the gate that night, nobody but Templars going\nto their chambers. The one fact riddles the rest of Sarah's statement in\ndefence, but, as it is somewhat of a masterpiece in lying invention,\nI shall continue to quote it. \"Mary Tracey would have gone about the\nrobbery just then, but I said it was too soon. Between ten and eleven\nshe said, 'We can do it now.' I told her I would go and see, and so went\nupstairs, and they followed me. I met the young maid on the stairs with\na blue mug; she was going for some milk to make a sack posset. She asked\nme who were those that came after me. I told her they were people going\nto Mr Knight's below. As soon as she was gone I said to Mary Tracey,\n'Now do you and Tom Alexander go down. I know the door is ajar, because\nthe old maid is ill, and can't get up to let the young maid in when she\ncomes back.' Upon that, James Alexander, by my order, went in and hid\nhimself under the bed; and as I was going down myself I met the young\nmaid coming up again. She asked me if I spoke to Mrs Betty. I told her\nno; though I should have told her otherwise, but only that I was afraid\nshe might say something to Mrs Betty about me, and Mrs Betty might tell\nher I had not been there, and so they might have a suspicion of me.\"\n\nThere is a possibility that this part of her confession, the tale of\nhaving met the young maid, Nanny, may be true.[21] And here may the\ntruth of the murder be hidden away. Very likely it is, indeed, that\nSarah encountered the girl going out with the blue mug for milk to make\na sack posset, and she may have slipped in by the open door to hide\nunder the bed until the moment was ripe for her terrible intention. On\nthe other hand, if there is truth in the tale of her encountering the\ngirl again as she returned with the milk--and her cunning in answering\n\"no\" to the maid's query if she had seen Mrs Betty has the real\nring--other ways of getting an entry were open to her. We know that the\nlock of the vacant chambers opposite Mrs Duncomb's would have yielded\nto small manipulation. It is not at all unlikely that Sarah, having been\ncharwoman to the old lady, and with the propensities picked up from her\nShoreditch acquaintances, had made herself familiar with the locks on\nthe landing. So that she may have waited her hour in the empty rooms,\nand have got into Mrs Duncomb's by the same method used by Mrs Oliphant\nafter the murder. She may even have slipped back the spring-catch of the\nouter door. One account of the murder suggests that she may have\nasked Ann Price, on one pretext or other, to let her share her bed. It\ncertainly was not beyond the callousness of Sarah Malcolm to have chosen\nthis method, murdering the girl in her sleep, and then going on to\nfinish off the two helpless old women.\n\n\nThe truth, as I have said, lies hidden in this extraordinarily\nmendacious confection. Liars of Sarah's quality are apt to base their\nfabrications on a structure, however slight, of truth. I continue with\nthe confession, then, for what the reader may get out of it.\n\n\"I passed her [Nanny Price] and went down, and spoke with Tracey and\nAlexander, and then went to my master's chambers, and stirred up the\nfire. I stayed about a quarter of an hour, and when I came back I saw\nTracey and Tom Alexander sitting on Mrs Duncomb's stairs, and I sat down\nwith them. At twelve o'clock we heard some people walking, and by and by\nMr Knight came home, went to his room, and shut the door. It was a very\nstormy night; there was hardly anybody stirring abroad, and the watchmen\nkept up close, except just when they cried the hour. At two o'clock\nanother gentleman came, and called the watch to light his candle, upon\nwhich I went farther upstairs, and soon after this I heard Mrs Duncomb's\ndoor open; James Alexander came out, and said, 'Now is the time.' Then\nMary Tracey and Thomas Alexander went in, but I stayed upon the stair\nto watch. I had told them where Mrs Duncomb's box stood. They came out\nbetween four and five, and one of them called to me softly, and said,\n'Hip! How shall I shut the door?' Says I, ''Tis a spring-lock; pull it\nto, and it will be fast.' And so one of them did. They would have shared\nthe money and goods upon the stairs, but I told them we had better go\ndown; so we went under the arch by Fig-tree Court, where there was a\nlamp. I asked them how much they had got. They said they had found fifty\nguineas and some silver in the maid's purse, about one hundred pounds\nin the chest of drawers, besides the silver tankard and the money in the\nbox and several other things; so that in all they had got to the value\nof about three hundred pounds in money and goods. They told me that they\nhad been forced to gag the people. They gave me the tankard with what\nwas in it and some linen for my share, and they had a silver spoon and\na ring and the rest of the money among themselves. They advised me to be\ncunning and plant the money and goods underground, and not to be seen to\nbe flush. Then we appointed to meet at Greenwich, but we did not go.[22]\n\n\n\"I was taken in the manner the witnesses have sworn, and carried to the\nwatch-house, from whence I was sent to the Compter, and so to Newgate.\nI own that I said the tankard was mine, and that it was left me by my\nmother: several witnesses have swore what account I gave of the tankard\nbeing bloody; I had hurt my finger, and that was the occasion of it. I\nam sure of death, and therefore have no occasion to speak anything but\nthe truth. When I was in the Compter I happened to see a young man[23]\nwhom I knew, with a fetter on. I told him I was sorry to see him there,\nand I gave him a shilling, and called for half a quartern of rum to make\nhim drink. I afterwards went into my room, and heard a voice call\nme, and perceived something poking behind the curtain. I was a little\nsurprised, and looking to see what it was, I found a hole in the wall,\nthrough which the young man I had given the shilling to spoke to me, and\nasked me if I had sent for my friends. I told him no. He said he would\ndo what he could for me, and so went away; and some time after he called\nto me again, and said, 'Here is a friend.'\n\n\n\"I looked through, and saw Will Gibbs come in. Says he, 'Who is there\nto swear against you?' I told him my two masters would be the chief\nwitnesses. 'And what can they charge you with?' says he. I told him the\ntankard was the only thing, for there was nothing else that I thought\ncould hurt me. 'Never fear, then,' says he; 'we'll do well enough. We\nwill get them that will rap the tankard was your grandmother's, and that\nyou was in Shoreditch the night the act was committed; and we'll have\ntwo men that shall shoot your masters. But,' said he, 'one of the\nwitnesses is a woman, and she won't swear under four guineas; but the\nmen will swear for two guineas apiece,' and he brought a woman and three\nmen. I gave them ten guineas, and they promised to wait for me at the\nBull Head in Broad Street. But when I called for them, when I was going\nbefore Sir Richard Brocas, they were not there. Then I found I should\nbe sent to Newgate, and I was full of anxious thoughts; but a young man\ntold me I had better go to the Whit than to the Compter.\n\n\"When I came to Newgate I had but eighteenpence in silver, besides the\nmoney in my hair, and I gave eighteenpence for my garnish. I was ordered\nto a high place in the gaol. Buck, as I said before, having seen my hair\nloose, told Johnson of it, and Johnson asked me if I had got any cole\nplanted there. He searched and found the bag, and there was in\nit thirty-six moidores, eighteen guineas, five crown pieces, two\nhalf-crowns, two broad pieces of twenty-five shillings, four of\ntwenty-three shillings, and one half-broad piece. He told me I must be\ncunning, and not to be seen to be flush of money. Says I, 'What would\nyou advise me to do with it?' 'Why,' says he, 'you might have thrown it\ndown the sink, or have burnt it, but give it to me, and I'll take care\nof it.' And so I gave it to him. Mr Alstone then brought me to the\ncondemned hold and examined me. I denied all till I found he had\nheard of the money, and then I knew my life was gone. And therefore I\nconfessed all that I knew. I gave him the same account of the robbers as\nI have given you. I told him I heard my masters were to be shot, and\nI desired him to send them word. I described Tracey and the two\nAlexanders, and when they were first taken they denied that they knew Mr\nOakes, whom they and I had agreed to rob.\n\n\"All that I have now declared is fact, and I have no occasion to murder\nthree persons on a false accusation; for I know I am a condemned woman.\nI know I must suffer an ignominious death which my crimes deserve, and I\nshall suffer willingly. I thank God He has given me time to repent, when\nI might have been snatched off in the midst of my crimes, and without\nhaving an opportunity of preparing myself for another world.\" There is\na glibness and an occasional turn of phrase in this confession which\nsuggests some touching up from the pen of a pamphleteer, but one may\ntake it that it is, in substance, a fairly accurate report. In spite of\nthe pleading which threads it that she should be regarded as accessory\nonly in the robbery, the jury took something less than a quarter of\nan hour to come back with their verdict of \"Guilty of murder.\" Sarah\nMalcolm was sentenced to death in due form.\n\n\n\nV\n\nHaving regard to the period in which this confession was made, and\nconsidering the not too savoury reputations of Mary Tracey and the\nbrothers Alexander, we can believe that those three may well have\nthought themselves lucky to escape from the mesh of lies Sarah tried to\nweave about them.[24] It was not to be doubted on all the evidence that\nshe alone committed that cruel triple murder, and that she alone stole\nthe money which was found hidden in her hair. The bulk of the stolen\nclothing was found in her possession, bloodstained. A white-handled\ncase-knife, presumably that used to cut Nanny Price's throat, was seen\non a table by the three women who, with Sarah herself, were first on the\nscene of the murder. It disappeared later, and it is to be surmised that\nSarah Malcolm managed to get it out of the room unseen. But to the last\nmoment possible Sarah tried to get her three friends involved with her.\nSay, which is not at all unlikely, that Tracey and the Alexanders may\nhave first suggested the robbery to her, and her vindictive maneouvring\nmay be understood.\n\n\nIt is said that when she heard that Tracey and the Alexanders had been\ntaken she was highly pleased. She smiled, and said that she could now\ndie happy, since the real murderers had been seized. Even when the three\nwere brought face to face with her for identification she did not lack\nbrazenness. \"Ay,\" she said, \"these are the persons who committed the\nmurder.\" \"You know this to be true,\" she said to Tracey. \"See, Mary,\nwhat you have brought me to. It is through you and the two Alexanders\nthat I am brought to this shame, and must die for it. You all promised\nme you would do no murder, but, to my great surprise, I found the\ncontrary.\"\n\nShe was, you will perceive, a determined liar. Condemned, she behaved\nwith no fortitude. \"I am a dead woman!\" she cried, when brought back to\nNewgate. She wept and prayed, lied still more, pretended illness, and\nhad fits of hysteria. They put her in the old condemned hold with a\nconstant guard over her, for fear that she would attempt suicide.\n\nThe idlers of the town crowded to the prison to see her, for in the time\nof his Blessed Majesty King George II Newgate, with the condemned hold\nand its content, composed one of the fashionable spectacles. Young\nMr Hogarth, the painter, was one of those who found occasion to visit\nNewgate to view the notorious murderess. He even painted her portrait.\nIt is said that Sarah dressed specially for him in a red dress, but that\ncopy--one which belonged to Horace Walpole--which is now in the National\nGallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, shows her in a grey gown, with a white\ncap and apron. Seated to the left, she leans her folded hands on a table\non which a rosary and a crucifix lie. Behind her is a dark grey wall,\nwith a heavy grating over a dark door to the right. There are varied\nmezzotints of this picture by Hogarth himself still extant, and there is\na pen-and-wash drawing of Sarah by Samuel Wale in the British Museum.\n\nThe stories regarding the last days in life of Sarah Malcolm would\noccupy more pages than this book can afford to spend on them. To the\nlast she hoped for a reprieve. After the \"dead warrant\" had arrived, to\naccount for a paroxysm of terror that seized her, she said that it was\nfrom shame at the idea that, instead of going to Tyburn, she was to be\nhanged in Fleet Street among all the people that knew her, she having\njust heard the news in chapel. This too was one of her lies. She had\nheard the news hours before. A turnkey, pointing out the lie to her,\nurged her to confess for the easing of her mind.\n\nOne account I have of the Tanfield Court murders speaks of the custom\nthere was at this time of the bellman of St Sepulchre's appearing\noutside the gratings of the condemned hold just after midnight on the\nmorning of executions.[25] This performance was provided for by bequest\nfrom one Robert Dove, or Dow, a merchant-tailor. Having rung his bell\nto draw the attention of the condemned (who, it may be gathered, were\nnot supposed to be at all in want of sleep), the bellman recited these\nverses:\n\n  All you that in the condemned hold do lie,\n  Prepare you, for to-morrow you shall die.\n  Watch all and pray; the hour is drawing near\n  That you before th' Almighty must appear.\n\n  Examine well yourselves, in time repent,\n  That you may not t'eternal flames be sent:\n  And when St 'Pulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,\n  The Lord above have mercy on your souls!\n          Past twelve o'clock![26]\n\n\nA fellow-prisoner or a keeper bade Sarah Malcolm heed what the bellman\nsaid, urging her to take it to heart. Sarah said she did, and threw the\nbellman down a shilling with which to buy himself a pint of wine.\n\nSarah, as we have seen, was denied the honour of procession to Tyburn.\nHer sentence was that she was to be hanged in Fleet Street, opposite the\nMitre Court, on the 7th of March, 1733. And hanged she was accordingly.\nShe fainted in the tumbril, and took some time to recover. Her last\nwords were exemplary in their piety, but in the face of her vindictive\nlying, unretracted to the last, it were hardly exemplary to repeat them.\n\nShe was buried in the churchyard of St Sepulchre's.\n\n\n\n\nV: -- ALMOST A LADY[27]\n\n\nBorn (probably illegitimately) in a fisherman's cottage, reared in a\nworkhouse, employed in a brothel, won at cards by a royal duke, mistress\nof that duke, married to a baron, received at Court by three kings\n(though not much in the way of kings), accused of cozenage and\ntacitly of murder, died full of piety, 'cutting up' for close on\nL150,000--there, as it were in a nutshell, you have the life of Sophie\nDawes, Baronne de Feucheres.\n\nIn the introduction to her exhaustive and accomplished biography of\nSophie Dawes,[28] from which a part of the matter for this resume is\ndrawn, Mme Violette Montagu, speaking of the period in which Sophie\nlived, says that \"Paris, with its fabulous wealth and luxury, seems to\nhave been looked upon as a sort of Mecca by handsome Englishwomen with\nambition and, what is absolutely necessary if they wish to be really\nsuccessful, plenty of brains.\"\n\n\nIt is because Sophie had plenty of brains of a sort, besides the\nattributes of good looks, health, and by much a disproportionate share\nof determination, and because, with all that she attained to, she died\nquite ostracized by the people with whom it had been her life's ambition\nto mix, and was thus in a sense a failure--it is because of these things\nthat it is worth while going into details of her career, expanding the\nprecis with which this chapter begins.\n\nAmong the women selected as subjects for this book Sophie Dawes as a\npersonality wins 'hands down.' Whether she was a criminal or not is a\nquestion even now in dispute. Unscrupulous she certainly was, and a good\ndeal of a rogue. That modern American product the 'gold-digger' is\nwhat she herself would call a 'piker' compared with the subject of\nthis chapter. The blonde bombshell, with her 'sugar daddy,' her alimony\n'racket,' and the hundred hard-boiled dodges wherewith she chisels\nmoney and goods from her prey, is, again in her own crude phraseology,\n'knocked for a row of ash-cans' by Sophie Dawes. As, I think, you will\npresently see.\n\nSophie was born at St Helens, Isle of Wight--according to herself in\n1792. There is controversy on the matter. Mme Montagu in her book says\nthat some of Sophie's biographers put the date at 1790, or even 1785.\nBut Mme Montagu herself reproduces the list of wearing apparel with\nwhich Sophie was furnished when she left the 'house of industry' (the\nworkhouse). It is dated 1805. In those days children were not maintained\nin poor institutions to the mature ages of fifteen or twenty. They were\nsupposed to be armed against life's troubles at twelve or even younger.\nSophie, then, could hardly have been born before 1792, but is quite\nlikely to have been born later.\n\nThe name of Sophie's father is given as \"Daw.\" Like many another\ncelebrity, as, for example, Walter Raleigh and Shakespeare, Sophie\nspelled her name variously, though ultimately she fixed on \"Dawes.\"\nRichard, or Dickey, Daw was a fisherman for appearance sake and a\nsmuggler for preference. The question of Sophie's legitimacy anses from\nthe fact that her mother, Jane Callaway, was registered at death as \"a\nspinster.\" Sophie was one of ten children. Dickey Daw drank his family\ninto the poorhouse, an institution which sent Sophie to fend for herself\nin 1805, procuring her a place as servant at a farm on the island.\n\nService on a farm does not appear to have appealed to Sophie. She\nescaped to Portsmouth, where she found a job as hotel chambermaid.\nTiring of that, she went to London and became a milliner's assistant.\nA little affair we hear, in which a mere water-carrier was an equal\nparticipant, lost Sophie her place. We next have word of her imitating\nNell Gwynn, both in selling oranges to playgoers and in becoming an\nactress--not, however, at Old Drury, but at the other patent theatre,\nCovent Garden. Save that as a comedian she never took London by storm,\nand that she lacked Nell's unfailing good humour, Sophie in her career\nmatches Nell in more than superficial particulars. Between selling\noranges and appearing on the stage Sophie seems to have touched bottom\nfor a time in poverty. But her charms as an actress captivated an\nofficer by and by, and she was established as his mistress in a house\nat Turnham Green. Tiring of her after a time--Sophie, it is probable,\nbecame exigeant with increased comfort--her protector left her with an\nannuity of L50.\n\nThe annuity does not appear to have done Sophie much good. We next\nhear of her as servant-maid in a Piccadilly brothel, a lupanar\nmuch patronized by wealthy emigres from France, among whom was\nLouis-Henri-Joseph, Duc de Bourbon and later Prince de Conde, a man at\nthat time of about fifty-four.\n\nThe Duc's attention was directed to the good looks of Sophie by a\nmanservant of his. Mme Montagu says of Sophie at this time that \"her\nface had already lost the first bloom of youth and innocence.\" Now, one\nwonders if that really was so, or if Mme Montagu is making a shot at a\nhazard. She describes Sophie a little earlier than this as having\ndeveloped into a fine young woman, not exactly pretty or handsome, but\nshe held her head gracefully, and her regular features were illumined\nby a pair of remarkably bright and intelligent eyes. She was tall and\nsquarely built, with legs and arms which might have served as models\nfor a statue of Hercules. Her muscular force was extraordinary. Her lips\nwere rather thin, and she had an ugly habit of contracting them when she\nwas angry. Her intelligence was above the average, and she had a good\nshare of wit.\n\n\nAt the time when the Duc de Bourbon came upon her in the Piccadilly\nstew the girl was probably no more than eighteen. If one may judge\nher character from the events of her subsequent career there was an\noutstanding resiliency and a resoluteness as main ingredients of her\nmake-up, qualities which would go a long way to obviating any marks that\nmight otherwise have been left on her by the ups and downs of a mere\nfive years in the world. If, moreover, Mme Montagu's description of her\nis a true one it is clear that Sophie's good looks were not of the sort\nto make an all-round appeal. The ways in which attractiveness goes,\nboth in men and in women, are infinite in their variety. The reader may\nrecall, in this respect, what was said in the introductory chapter about\nKate Webster and the instance of the bewhiskered 'Fina of the Spanish\ntavern. And since a look of innocence and the bloom of youth may, and\nvery often do, appear on the faces of individuals who are far from being\ninnocent or even young, it may well be that Sophie in 1810, servant-maid\nin a brothel though she was, still kept a look of country freshness and\nhealth, unjaded enough to whet the dulled appetence of a bagnio-haunting\nold rip. The odds are, at all events, that Sophie was much less\nartificial in her charms than the practised ladies of complacency upon\nwhom she attended. With her odd good looks she very likely had just that\nsubacid leaven for which, in the alchemy of attraction, the Duc was in\nsearch.\n\nThe Duc, however, was not the only one to whom Sophie looked desirable.\nTwo English peers had an eye on her--the Earl of Winchilsea and the Duke\nof Kent. This is where the card affair comes in. The Duc either played\nwhist with the two noblemen for sole rights in Sophie or, what is more\nlikely, cut cards with them during a game. The Duc won. Whether his win\nmay be regarded as lucky or not can be reckoned, according to the taste\nand fancy of the reader, from the sequelae of some twenty years.\n\n\n\nII\n\nWith the placing of Sophie dans ses meubles by the Duc de Bourbon there\nbegan one of the most remarkable turns in her career. In 1811 he took a\nhouse for her in Gloucester Street, Queen's Square, with her mother as\nduenna, and arranged for the completion of her education.\n\nAs a light on her character hardly too much can be made of this stage in\nher development. It is more than likely that the teaching was begun at\nSophie's own demand, and by the use she made of the opportunities given\nher you may measure the strength of her ambition. Here was no rich\nman's doxy lazily seeking a veneer of culture, enough to gloss the rough\npatches of speech and idea betraying humble origin. This fisherman's\nchild, workhouse girl, ancilla of the bordels, with the thin smattering\nof the three R's she had acquired in the poor institution, set herself,\nwith a wholehearted concentration which a Newnham 'swot' might envy,\nto master modern languages, with Greek, Latin, and music. At the end of\nthree years she was a good linguist, could play and sing well enough to\nentertain and not bore the most intelligent in the company the Duc\nkept, and to pass in that company--the French emigre set in London--as\na person of equal education. If, as it is said, Sophie, while she could\nread and write French faultlessly, never could speak it without an\nEnglish accent, it is to be remembered that the flexibility of tongue\nand mind needed for native-sounding speech in French (or any other\nlanguage) is so exceptional as to be practically non-existent among her\ncompatriots to this day. The fault scarcely belittles her achievement.\nAs well blame a one-legged man for hopping when trying to run.\nConsider the life Sophie had led, the sort of people with whom she had\nassociated, and that temptation towards laissez-faire which conquers all\nbut the rarest woman in the mode of life in which she was existing,\nand judge of the constancy of purpose that kept that little nose so\nsteadfastly in Plutarch and Xenophon.\n\nIf in the year 1812 the Duc began to allow his little Sophie about\nL800 a year in francs as pin-money he was no more generous than Sophie\ndeserved. The Duc was very rich, despite the fact that his father, the\nold Prince de Conde, was still alive, and so, of course, was enjoying\nthe income from the family estates.\n\nThere is no room here to follow more than the barest outline of the Duc\nde Bourbon's history. Fully stated, it would be the history of France.\nHe was a son of the Prince de Conde who collected that futile army\nbeyond the borders of France in the royalist cause in the Revolution.\nLouis-Henri was wounded in the left arm while serving there, so badly\nwounded that the hand was practically useless. He came to England,\nwhere he lived until 1814, when he went back to France to make his\nunsuccessful attempt to raise the Vendee. Then he went to Spain.\n\nAt this time he intended breaking with Sophie, but when he got back to\nParis in 1815 he found the lady waiting for him. It took Sophie some\neighteen months to bring his Highness up to scratch again. During this\ntime the Duc had another English fancy, a Miss Harris, whose reign in\nfavour, however, did not withstand the manoeuvring of Sophie.\n\nSophie as a mistress in England was one thing, but Sophie unattached as\na mistress in France was another. One wonders why the Duc should have\nbeen squeamish on this point. Perhaps it was that he thought it would\nlook vulgar to take up a former mistress after so long. At all events,\nhe was ready enough to resume the old relationship with Sophie, provided\nshe could change her name by marriage. Sophie was nothing loth. The idea\nfell in with her plans. She let it get about that she was the natural\ndaughter of the Duc, and soon had in tow one Adrien-Victor de Feucheres.\nHe was an officer of the Royal Guard. Without enlarging on the all-round\ntawdriness of this contract it will suffice here to say that Sophie and\nAdrien were married in London in August of 1818, the Duc presenting\nthe bride with a dowry of about L5600 in francs. Next year de Feucheres\nbecame a baron, and was made aide-de-camp to the Duc.\n\nIncredible as it may seem, de Feucheres took four years to realize what\nwas the real relationship between his wife and the Prince de Conde. The\naide-de-camp and his wife had a suite of rooms in the Prince's favourite\nchateau at Chantilly, and the ambition which Sophie had foreseen would\nbe furthered by the marriage was realized. She was received as La\nBaronne de Feucheres at the Court of Louis XVIII. She was happy--up to a\npoint. Some unpretty traits in her character began to develop: a violent\ntemper, a tendency to hysterics if crossed, and, it is said, a leaning\ntowards avaricious ways. At the end of four years the Baron de Feucheres\nwoke up to the fact that Sophie was deceiving him. It does not appear,\nhowever, that he had seen through her main deception, because it was\nSophie herself, we are told, who informed him he was a fool--that she\nwas not the Prince's daughter, but his mistress.\n\nHaving waked up thus belatedly, or having been woken up by Sophie in her\nungoverned ill-temper, de Feucheres acted with considerable dignity. He\nbegged to resign his position as aide to the Prince, and returned his\nwife's dowry. The departure of Sophie's hitherto complacent husband\nrather embarrassed the Prince. He needed Sophie but felt he could not\nkeep her unattached under his roof and he sent her away--but only for a\nfew days. Sophie soon was back again in Chantilly.\n\nThe Prince made some attempt to get de Feucheres to return, but without\nsuccess. De Feucheres applied for a post in the Army of Spain, an\napplication which was granted at once. It took the poor man seven years\nto secure a judicial separation from his wife.\n\nThe scandal of this change in the menage of Chantilly--it happened in\n1822--reached the ears of the King, and the Baronne de Feucheres was\nforbidden to appear at Court. All Sophie's energies from then on were\nconcentrated on getting the ban removed. She explored all possible\navenues of influence to this end, and, incidentally drove her old lover\nnearly frantic with her complaints giving him no peace. Even a rebuff\nfrom the Duchesse de Berry, widow of the son of that prince who was\nafterwards Charles X, did not put her off. She turned up one day at the\nTuileries, to be informed by an usher that she could not be admitted.\n\nThis desire to be reinstated in royal favour is at the back of all\nSophie's subsequent actions--this and her intention of feathering her\nown nest out of the estate of her protector. It explains why she worked\nso hard to have the Prince de Conde assume friendly relations with a\nfamily whose very name he hated: that of the Duc d'Orleans. It is a clue\nto the mysterious death, eight years later, of the Prince de Conde, last\nof the Condes, in circumstances which were made to pass as suicide, but\nwhich in unhampered inquiry would almost certainly have been found to\nindicate murder.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nLouis-Henri-Joseph, Duc de Bourbon and Prince de Conde, seems to have\nbeen rather a simple old man: a useless old sinner, true enough,\nbut relatively harmless in his sinning, relatively venial in his\nuselessness. It were futile to seek for the morality of a later age in a\nman of his day and rank and country, just as it were obtuse to look for\ngreatness in one so much at the mercy of circumstance. As far as bravery\nwent he had shown himself a worthy descendant of \"the Great Conde.\" But,\nsurrounded by the vapid jealousies of the most useless people who had\never tried to rule a country, he, no more than his father, had\nthe faintest chance to show the Conde quality in war. Adrift as a\ncomparatively young man, his world about his ears, with no occupation,\nsmall wonder that in idleness he fell into the pursuit of satisfactions\nfor his baser appetites. He would have been, there is good reason to\nbelieve, a happy man and a busy one in a camp. There is this to be\nsaid for him: that alone among the spineless crowd of royalists feebly\nwaiting for the miracle which would restore their privilege he attempted\na blow for the lost cause. But where in all that bed of disintegrating\nchalk was the flint from which he might have evoked a spark?\n\nThe great grief of the Prince's life was the loss of his son, the young\nDuc d'Enghien, shamefully destroyed by Bonaparte. It is possible that\nmuch of the Prince's inertia was due to this blow. He had married, at\nthe early age of fourteen, Louise-Marie-Therese-Mathilde d'Orleans,\ndaughter of Louis-Philippe, Duc d'Orleans and the Duchesse de Chartres,\nthe bride being six years older than her husband. Such a marriage could\nnot last. It merely sustained the honeymoon and the birth of that only\nson. The couple were apart in eighteen months, and after ten years they\nnever even saw each other again. About the time when Sophie's husband\nfound her out and departed the Princesse died. The Prince was advised\nto marry again, on the chance that an heir might be born to the large\nfortune he possessed. But Sophie by then had become a habit with\nthe Prince--a bad one--and the old man was content to be left to his\ncontinual hunting, and not to bother over the fact that he was the last\nof his ancient line.\n\nIt may be easily believed that the Prince's disinclination to marry\nagain contented Sophie very well. And the fact that he had no direct\nheir was one in which she saw possibilities advantageous to herself.\n\nThe Prince was then sixty-six years old. In the course of nature he was\nalmost bound to predecease her. His wealth was enormous, and out of\nit Sophie wanted as much by bequest as she could get. She was much too\nshrewd, however, to imagine that, even if she did contrive to be made\nhis sole heir, the influential families who had an eye upon the great\npossessions of the Prince, and who through relationship had some right\nto expect inheritance, would allow such a will to go uncontested. She\ntherefore looked about among the Prince's connexions for some one who\nwould accept coheirship with herself, and whose family would be strong\nenough in position to carry through probate on such terms, but at the\nsame time would be grateful enough to her and venal enough to further\nher aim of being reinstated at Court. Her choice in this matter shows\nat once her political cunning, which would include knowledge of affairs,\nand her ability as a judge of character.\n\nIt should be remembered that, in spite of his title of Duc de Bourbon,\nSophie's elderly protector was only distantly of that family. He was\ndescended in direct line from the Princes de Conde, whose connexion with\nthe royal house of France dated back to the sixteenth century. The other\nline of 'royal' ducs in the country was that of Orleans, offshoot of\nthe royal house through Philippe, son of Louis XIII, and born in 1640.\nSophie's protector, Louis-Henri-Joseph, Prince de Conde, having married\nLouise-Marie, daughter of the great-grandson of this Philippe, was thus\nthe brother-in-law of that Louis-Philippe, Duc d'Orleans, who in\nthe Revolution was known as \"Egalite.\" This was a man whom, for his\npolitical opinion and for his failure to stand by the King, Louis XVI,\nthe Prince de Conde utterly detested in memory. As much, moreover, as he\nhad hated the father did the Prince de Conde detest Egalite's son. But\nit was out of this man's family that Sophie selected, though ultimately,\nher coheir.\n\nBefore she arrived at this point, however, Sophie had been at pains to\ndo some not very savoury manoeuvring.\n\nBy a dancer at the Opera, called Mimi, the Prince de Conde had an\nillegitimate daughter, whom he had caused to be educated and whom he had\nmarried to the Comte de Rully. The Comtesse de Rully and her husband had\na suite at Chantilly. This was an arrangement which Sophie, as reigning\nQueen of Chantilly, did not like at all. While the Rully woman remained\nat Chantilly Sophie could not think that her sway over the Prince was\nquite as absolute as she wished. It took her six years of badgering her\nprotector, from 1819 to 1825, to bring about the eviction.\n\nBut meantime (for Sophie's machinations must be taken as concurrent with\nevents as they transpire) the Baronne de Feucheres had approached\nthe son of Philippe-Egalite, suggesting that the last-born of his\nsix children, the Duc d'Aumale, should have the Prince de Conde\nfor godfather. If she could persuade her protector to this the Duc\nd'Orleans, in return, was to use his influence for her reinstatement at\nCourt. And persuade the old man to this Sophie did, albeit after a great\ndeal of badgering on her part and a great deal of grumbling on the part\nof the Prince.\n\nThe influence exerted at Court by the Duc d'Orleans does not seem to\nhave been very effective. The King who had dismissed her the Court,\nLouis XVIII, died in 1824. His brother, the Comte d'Artois, ascended\nthe throne as Charles X, and continued by politically foolish recourses,\ncomparable in history to those of the English Stuarts, to alienate the\npeople by attempting to regain that anachronistic absolute power which\nthe Revolution had destroyed. He lasted a mere six years as king. The\nrevolution of 1830 sent him into exile. But up to the last month or so\nof those six years he steadfastly refused to have anything to do with\nthe Baronne de Feucheres--not that Sophie ever gave up manoeuvring and\nwheedling for a return to Court favour.\n\nAbout 1826 Sophie had a secret proposition made to the King that she\nshould try to persuade the Prince de Conde to adopt as his heir one\nof the brothers of the Duchesse de Berry, widow of the King's second\nson--or would his Majesty mind if a son of the Duc d'Orleans was\nadopted? The King did not care at all.\n\nAfter that Sophie pinned her faith in the power possessed by the Duc\nd'Orleans. She was not ready to pursue the course whereby her return to\nCourt might have been secured--namely, to abandon her equivocal position\nin the Prince de Conde's household, and thus her power over the Prince.\nShe wanted first to make sure of her share of the fortune he would\nleave. She knew her power over the old man. Already she had persuaded\nhim to buy and make over to her the estates of Saint-Leu and Boissy, as\nwell as to make her legacies to the amount of a million francs. Much as\nshe wanted to be received again at Court, she wanted more just as much\nas she could grab from the Prince's estate. To make her inheritance\nsecure she needed the help of the Duc d'Orleans.\n\nThe Duc d'Orleans was nothing loth. He had the mind of a French\nbourgeois, and all the bourgeois itch for money. He knew that the Prince\nde Conde hated him, hated his politics, hated his very name. But during\nthe seven years it took Sophie to bring the Prince to the point of\nsigning the will she had in mind the son of Philippe-Egalite fawned\nlike a huckster on his elderly and, in more senses than one, distant\nrelative. The scheme was to have the Prince adopt the little Duc\nd'Aumale, already his godchild, as his heir.\n\nThe ways by which Sophie went about the job of persuading her old lover\ndo not read pleasantly. She was a termagant. The Prince was stubborn. He\nhated the very idea of making a will--it made him think of death. He\nwas old, ill, friendless. Sophie made his life a hell, but he had\nbecome dependent upon her. She ill-used him, subjecting him to physical\nviolence, but yet he was afraid she might, as she often threatened,\nleave him. Her way of persuading him reached the point, it is on\nrecord, of putting a knife to his throat. Not once but several times\nhis servants found him scratched and bruised. But the old man could not\nsummon up the strength of mind to be quit of this succubine virago.\n\nAt last, on the 29th of August, 1829, Sophie's 'persuasions' succeeded.\nThe Prince consented to sign the will, and did so the following morning.\nIn its terms the Duc d'Aumale became residuary legatee, and 2,000,000\nfrancs, free of death-duty, were bequeathed to the Prince's \"faithful\ncompanion, Mme la baronne de Feucheres,\" together with the chateaux\nand estates of Saint-Leu-Taverny, Boissy, Enghien, Montmorency, and\nMortefontaine, and the pavilion in the Palais-Bourbon, besides all the\nPrince's furniture, carriages, horses, and so on. Moreover, the estate\nand chateau of Ecouen was also given her, on condition that she allowed\nthe latter to be used as an orphanage for the descendants of soldiers\nwho had served with the Armies of Conde and La Vendee. The cost\nof running this establishment, however, was to be borne by the Duc\nd'Aumale.\n\nIt might be thought that Sophie, having got her way, would have turned\nto kindness in her treatment of her old lover. But no. All her mind\nwas now concentrated on working, through the Duc d'Orleans, for being\nreceived again at Court. She ultimately succeeded in this. On the 7th\nof February, 1830, she appeared in the presence of the King, the Dauphin\nand Dauphine. In the business of preparing for this great day Chantilly\nand the Prince de Conde were greatly neglected. The beggar on horseback\nhad to be about Paris.\n\nBut events were shaping in France at that time which were to be\nimportant to the royal family, to Sophie and her supporters of the house\nof Orleans, and fatal in consequence to the old man at Chantilly.\n\nOn the 27th of July revolution broke out in France. Charles X and\nhis family had to seek shelter in England, and Louis-Philippe, Duc\nd'Orleans, became--not King of France, but \"King of the French\" by\nelection. This consummation had not been achieved without intrigue on\nthe part of Egalite's son. It was not an achievement calculated to abate\nthe Prince de Conde's hatred for him. Rather did it inflame that hatred.\nIn the matter of the famous will, moreover, as the King's son the little\nDuc d'Aumale would be now in no need of the provision made for him\nby his unwilling godfather, while members of the exiled royal\nfamily--notably the grandson of Charles, the Duc de Bordeaux, certainly\ncut out of the Prince's will by the intrigues of Sophie and family--were\nin want of assistance. This is a point to be remembered in the light of\nsubsequent events.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nWhile she had been looking after herself Sophie Dawes had not been\nunmindful ofthe advancement of hangers-on of her own family. She had\nabout her a nephew and a niece. The latter, supposed by some to have a\ncloser relationship to Sophie than that of mere niece, she had contrived\nto marry off to a marquis. The Marquise de Chabannes de la Palice need\nnot here concern us further. But notice must be taken of the nephew.\nA few million francs, provided by the Prince de Conde, had secured for\nthis James Dawes the title of Baron de Flassans, from a domain also\nbestowed upon him by Sophie's elderly lover. De Flassans, with some\nminor post in the Prince's household, acted as his aunt's jackal.\n\nIf Sophie, after the election to kingship of Louis-Philippe, found\nit necessary to be in Paris a great deal to worship at the throne her\nnephew kept her well informed about the Prince de Conde's activities.\nThe old man, it appeared, had suddenly developed the habit of writing\nletters. The Prince, then at the chateau of Saint-Leu expressed a desire\nto remove to Chantilly. He was behaving very oddly all round, was glad\nto have Sophie out of his sight, and seemed unwilling even to hear her\nname. The projected move to Chantilly, as a fact, was merely a blind to\ncover a flight out of Sophie's reach and influence. Rumour arose about\nSaint-Leu and in Paris that the Prince had made another will--one in\nwhich neither Sophie nor the Duc d'Aumale was mentioned. This was a move\nof which Sophie had been afraid. She saw to it that the Prince did not\nget away from Saint-Leu. Rumour and the Prince's conduct made Sophie\nvery anxious. She tried to get him to make over to her in his lifetime\nthose properties which he had left to her in his will, and it is\nprobable enough that she would have forced this request but for the fact\nthat, to raise the legal costs, the property of Saint-Leu would have had\nto be sold.\n\nThis was the position of affairs about the middle of August 1830. It was\nbelieved the Prince had already signed a will in favour of the exiled\nlittle Duc de Bordeaux, but that he had kept the act secret from his\nmistress.\n\nOn the morning of the 11th of the month the Prince was met outside his\nbedroom in his night attire. It was a young man called Obry who thus met\nthe Prince. He was the old man's godchild. The old man's left eye\nwas bleeding, and there was a scratch on his cheek as if made by a\nfingernail. To Obry the Prince attributed these wounds to the spite of\nthe Baronne de Feucheres. Half an hour later he told his valet he had\nhit his head against a night-table. Later again in the day he gave\nanother version still: he had fallen against the door to a secret\nstaircase from his bedroom while letting the Baronne de Feucheres\nout, the secret staircase being in communication with Sophie's private\napartments.\n\nFor the next ten days or so the Prince was engaged in contriving his\nflight from the gentle Sophie, a second plan which again was spoiled by\nSophie's spies. There was something of a fete at Saint-Leu on the 26th,\nthe Prince's saint's day. There was a quarrel between Sophie and the\nPrince on the morning of the 26th in the latter's bedroom. Sophie had\nthen been back in Saint-Leu for three days. At midnight on the 26th the\nold man retired after playing a game or two at whist. He was to go on\nthe 30th to Chantilly. He was accompanied to his bedroom by his surgeon\nand a valet, one Lecomte, and expressed a desire to be called at eight\no'clock. Lecomte found a paper in the Prince's trousers and gave it to\nthe old man, who placed it on the mantelshelf. Then the valet, as he\nsaid later, locked the door of the Prince's dressing-room, thus--except\nfor the entrance from the secret staircase--locking the old man in his\nroom.\n\nThe Prince's apartments were on the first floor of the chateau. His\nbedroom was approached through the dressing-room from the main corridor.\nBeyond the dressing-room was a passage, turning left from which was\nthe bedroom, and to the right in which was an entrance to an anteroom.\nFacing the dressing-room door in this same passage was the entrance to\nthe secret staircase already mentioned. The staircase gave access to the\nBaronne de Feucheres' apartments on the entrance floor. These, however,\nwere not immediately under the Prince's rooms. An entresol intervened,\nand here the rooms were occupied by the Abbe Briant, a creature of\nSophie's and her secretary, the Widow Lachassine, Sophie's lady's-maid,\nand a couple named Dupre. These last, also spies of Sophie's, had their\nroom direcdy below the Prince's bedroom, and it is recorded that the\nfloor was so thin that they could hear not only the old man's every\nmovement, but anything he said.\n\nAdjacent to the Prince's room, and on the same floor, were the rooms\noccupied by Lambot, the Prince's aide, and the valet Lecomte. Lambot was\na lover of Sophie's, and had been the great go-between in her intrigues\nwith the Orleans family over the will. Lecomte was in Sophie's pay.\nClose to Sophie's apartments on the entrance floor were the rooms\noccupied by her nephew and his wife, the de Flassans. It will be seen,\ntherefore, that the wing containing the Prince's rooms was otherwise\noccupied almost completely by Sophie's creatures.\n\nYou have, then, the stage set for the tragedy which was about to ensue:\nmidnight; the last of the Condes peaceably in his bedroom for the night,\nand locked in it (according to Lecomte). About him, on all sides, are\nthe creatures of his not too scrupulous mistress. All these people, with\nthe exception of the Baronne de Flassans, who sat up writing letters\nuntil two, retire about the same time.\n\nAnd at eight o'clock next morning, there being no answer to Lecomte's\nknocking to arouse the Prince, the door is broken open at the orders of\nthe Baronne de Feucheres. The Prince is discovered dead in his bedroom,\nsuspended by the neck, by means of two of his own handkerchiefs knotted\ntogether, from the fastening of one of the French windows.\n\nThe fastening was only about two and a half feet off the floor.\nThe handkerchief about the dead man's neck was loose enough to have\npermitted insertion of all the fingers of a hand between it and the\nneck. The second handkerchief was tied to the first, and its other end\nwas knotted to the window-fastening, and the dead man's right cheek was\npressed against the closed shutter. The knees were bent a little,\nthe feet were on the floor. None of the usual indications of death by\nstrangulation were present. The eyes were half closed. The face was pale\nbut not livid. The mouth was almost closed. There was no protrusion of\nthe tongue.\n\nOn the arrival of the civil functionaries, the Mayor of Saint-Leu and\na Justice of the Peace from Enghien, the body was taken down and put\non the bed. It was then found that the dead man's ankles were greatly\nbruised and his legs scratched. On the left side of the throat, at a\npoint too low for it to have been done by the handkerchief, there was\nsome stripping of the skin. A large red bruise was found between the\nPrince's shoulders.\n\nThe King, Louis-Philippe, heard about the death of the Prince de\nConde at half-past eleven that same day. He immediately sent his High\nChancellor, M. Pasquier, and his own aide-de-camp, M. de Rumigny, to\ninquire into the matter. It is not stretching things too far to say\nthat the King's instructions to these gentlemen are revealed in phrases\noccurring in the letters they sent his Majesty that same evening. Both\nrecommend that Drs. Marc and Marjolin should be sent to investigate\nthe Prince's tragic death. But M. Pasquier mentions that \"not a single\ndocument has been found, so a search has already been made.\" And M. de\nRumigny thinks \"it is important that nobody should be accused who\nis likely to benefit by the will.\" What document was expected to be\ndiscovered in the search? Why, a second will that would invalidate\nthe first. Who was to benefit by the first will? Why, the little Duc\nd'Aumale and Dame Sophie Dawes, Baronne de Feucheres!\n\nThe post-mortem examination was made by the King's own physicians.\nDuring the examination the Prince's doctors, MM. Dubois and Gendrin,\nhis personal secretary, and the faithful one among his body-servants,\nManoury, were sent out of the room. The verdict was suicide. The\nPrince's own doctors maintained that suicide by the handkerchiefs from\nthe window-fastening was impossible. Dr Dubois wrote his idea of how the\ndeath had occurred:\n\n\nThe Prince very likely was asleep in his bed. The murderers must have\nbeen given entrance to his bedroom--I have no wish to ask how or by\nwhom. They then threw themselves on the Prince, gripped him firmly,\nand could easily pin him down on his bed; then the most desperate and\ndexterous of the murderers suffocated him as he was thus held firmly\ndown; finally, in order to make it appear that he had committed suicide\nand to hinder any judicial investigations which might have discovered\nthe identity of the assassins, they fastened a handkerchief about their\nvictim's neck, and hung him up by the espagnolette of the window.\n\n\nAnd that, at all hazards, is about the truth of the death of the Duc de\nBourbon and Prince de Conde. There was some official display of rigour\nin investigation by the Procureur; there was much play with some\nmysterious papers found a good time after the first discovery\nhalf-burned in the fireplace of the Prince's bedroom; there was a lot\nput forward to support the idea of suicide; but the blunt truth of the\naffair is that the Prince de Conde was murdered, and that the murder\nwas hushed up as much as possible. Not, however, with complete success.\nThere were few in France who gave any countenance to the theory of\nsuicide.\n\nThe Prince, it will be remembered, had a practically disabled left arm.\nIt is said that he could not even remove his hat with his left hand. The\nknots in the handkerchiefs used to tie him to the espagnolette were both\ncomplicated and tightly made. Impossible for a one-handed man. His bed,\nwhich at the time of his retiring to it stood close to the alcove\nwall, was a good foot and a half away from that wall in the morning.\nImpossible feat also for this one-handed man. It was the Prince's habit\nto lie so much to one side of the bed that his servants had to prop the\noutside edge up with folded blankets. On the morning when his death was\ndiscovered it was seen that the edges still were high, while the centre\nwas very much pressed down. There was, in fact, a hollow in the bed's\nmiddle such as might have been made by some one standing on it with\nshoes on. It is significant that the bedclothes were neatly turned down.\nIf the Prince had got up on a sudden impulse to commit suicide he is\nhardly likely, being a prince, to have attempted remaking his bed. He\nmust, moreover, since he could normally get from bed only by rolling on\nhis side, have pressed out that heightened edge. Manoury, the valet who\nloved him, said that the bed in the morning looked more as if it had\nbeen SMOOTHED OUT than remade. This would tend to support the theory of\nDr Dubois. The murderers, having suffocated the Prince, would be likely\nto try effacing the effects of his struggling by the former method\nrather than the latter.\n\nBut the important point of the affair, as far as this chapter on it is\nconcerned, is the relation of Sophie Dawes with it on the conclusion\nof murder. How deeply was she implicated? Let us see how she acted\non hearing that there was no reply to Lecomte's knocking, and let us\nexamine her conduct from that moment on.\n\nNote that the Baronne de Feucheres was the first person whom Lecomte and\nthe Prince's surgeon apprised of the Prince's silence. She rushed out of\nher room and made for the Prince's, not by the secret staircase, but by\nthe main one. She knew, however, that the door to the secret staircase\nfrom the Prince's room was not bolted that night. This knowledge was\nadmitted for her later by the Prince's surgeon, M. Bonnie. She had gone\nup to the Prince's room by the main staircase in order to hide the fact,\nan action which gives a touch of theatricality to her exhibited concern\nabout the Prince's silence.\n\nThe search for documents spoken of by M. Pasquier in his letter to\nthe King had been carried out by Sophie in person, with the aid of her\nnephew de Flassans and the Abbe Briant. It was a thorough search, and a\npiece of indecorousness which she excused on the ground of being afraid\nthe Prince's executors might find a will which made her the sole heir,\nto the exclusion of the Duc d'Aumale.\n\nRegarding the 'accident' which had happened to the Prince on the 11th of\nAugust, she said it was explained by an earlier attempt on his part to\ndo away with himself. She tried to deny that she had been at Saint-Leu\nat the time of the actual happening, when the fact was that she only\nleft for Paris some hours later.\n\nWhen, some time later, the Prince's faithful valet Manoury made mention\nof the fact that the Prince had wanted to put the width of the country\nbetween himself and his mistress, Sophie first tried to put the fear\nof Louis-Philippe into the man, then, finding he was not to be silenced\nthat way, tried to buy him with a promise of employment.\n\nIt is beyond question that the Prince de Conde was murdered. He was\nmurdered in a wing of the chateau in which he was hemmed in on all sides\nby Sophie's creatures. It is impossible that Sophie was not privy, at\nthe least, to the deed. It is not beyond the bounds of probability that\nshe was an actual participator in the murder.\n\nShe was a violent woman, as violent and passionate as she was\ndetermined. Not once but many times is it on record that she physically\nill-used her elderly lover. There was one occasion, it is said, when\nthe Prince suddenly came upon her in a very compromising position with\na younger man in the park of one of his chateaux. Sophie, before\nthe Prince could utter a protest, cut him across the face with her\nriding-whip, and finished up by thrashing him with his own cane.\n\nHere you have the stuff, at any rate, of which your murderesses of the\nviolent type are made. It is the metal out of which your Kate Websters,\nyour Sarah Malcolms, your Meteyards and Brownriggs fashion themselves.\nIt takes more than three years of scholastic self-discipline, such as\nSophie Dawes in her ambition subjected herself to, to eradicate the\ninborn harridan. The very determination which was at the back of\nSophie's efforts at self-education, that will to have her own way, would\nserve to heighten the sick rage with which she would discover that her\ncarefully wrought plans of seven years had come to pieces. What was\nit that the Abbe Pelier de Lacroix had in \"proof of the horrible\nassassination\" of the Prince de Conde, but that he was prevented from\nplacing before the lawyers in charge of the later investigation, if not\nthe fact that the Prince had made a later will than the one by which\nSophie inherited so greatly? The Abbe was the Prince's chaplain. He\npublished a pamphlet declaring that the Prince had made a will leaving\nhis entire fortune to the little Duc de Bordeaux, but that Sophie had\nstolen this later will. Who likelier to be a witness to such a will than\nthe Prince's chaplain?\n\nIt needs no great feat of imagination to picture what the effect of\nsuch a discovery would be on a woman of Sophie's violent temper, or to\nconceive how little the matter of taking a life especially the life of\na feeble old man she was used to bullying and mishandling--would be\nallowed to stand in the way of rescuing her large gains. Murder of the\nPrince was her only chance. It had taken her seven years to bring him to\nthe point of signing that first will. He was seventy-four years of age,\nenfeebled, obstinate, and she knew of his plans to flee from her. Even\nsupposing that she could prevent his flight, could she begin all over\nagain to another seven years of bullying and wheedling--always with\nthe prospect of the old man dying before she could get him to the point\nagain of doing as she wished? The very existence of the second will was\na menace. It only needed that the would-be heirs of the Prince should\nhear of it, and there would be a swoop on their part to rescue the\ntestator from her clutches. In the balance against 2,000,000 francs and\nsome halfdozen castles with their estates the only wonder is that any\nreasonable person, knowing the history of Sophie Dawes, should hesitate\nabout the value she was likely to place on the old man's life.\n\nThe inquiry begun in September of 1830 into the circumstances\nsurrounding the death of the Prince was cooked before it was dressed.\nThe honest man into whose hands it was placed at first, a M. de la\nHurpoie, proved himself too zealous. After a night visit from the\nProcureur he was retired into private life. After that the investigators\nwere hand-picked. They concluded the investigation the following June,\nwith the declaration that the Prince had committed suicide, a verdict\nwhich had its reward--in advancement for the judges.\n\nIn the winter of 1831-32 there was begun a lawsuit in which the Princes\nde Rohan brought action against Sophie and the Duc d'Aumale for the\nupsetting of the will under which the latter two had inherited the\nPrince de Conde's fortune. The grounds for the action were the undue\ninfluence exerted by Sophie. The Princes de Rohan lost.\n\nThus was Sophie twice 'legally' vindicated. But public opinion refused\nher any coat of whitewash. Never popular in France, she became less and\nless popular in the years that followed her legal triumphs. Having used\nher for his own ends, Louis-Philippe gradually shut off from her the\nlight of his cod-like countenance.[29]\n\n\nSophie found little joy in her wide French possessions. She found\nherself without friends before whom she could play the great lady in her\ncastles. She gradually got rid of her possessions, and returned to her\nnative land. She bought an estate near Christchurch, in Hampshire, and\ntook a house in Hyde Park Square, London. But she did not long enjoy\nthose English homes. While being treated for dropsy in 1840 she died\nof angina. According to the famous surgeon who was at her bedside just\nbefore her demise, she died \"game.\"\n\nIt may almost be said that she lived game. There must have been a\nfighting quality about Sophie to take her so far from such a bad start.\nViolent as she was of temper, greedy, unscrupulous, she seems yet to\nhave had some instincts of kindness. The stories of her good deeds are\nrather swamped by those of her bad ones. She did try to do some good\nwith the Prince's money round about Chantilly, took a definite and\nlasting interest in the alms-houses built there by \"the Great Conde,\"\nand a request in her own will was to the effect that if she had ever\ndone anything for the Orleans gang, the Prince de Conde's wishes\nregarding the use of the chateau of Ecouen as an orphanage might be\nfulfilled as a reward to her. The request never was fulfilled, but it\ndoes show that Sophie had some affinity in kindness to Nell Gwynn.\n\nHow much farther--or how much better--would Sophie Dawes have fared had\nher manners been less at the mercy of her temper? It is impossible\nto say. That she had some quality of greatness is beyond doubt. The\nresolution of character, the will to achieve, and even the viraginous\ntemper might have carried her far had she been a man some thirty years\nearlier in the country of her greater activities. Under Napoleon, as\na man, Sophie might have climbed high on the way to glory. As a woman,\nwith those traits, there is almost tragic inevitability in the manner\nin which we find her ranged with what Dickens called \"Glory's bastard\nbrother\"--Murder.\n\n\n\n\nVI: -- ARSENIC A LA BRETONNE\n\nOn Tuesday, the 1st of July, in the year 1851, two gentlemen, sober\nof face as of raiment, presented themselves at the office of the\nProcureur-General in the City of Rennes. There was no need for them to\nintroduce themselves to that official. They were well-known medical\nmen of the city, Drs Pinault and Boudin. The former of the two acted as\nspokesman.\n\nDr Pinault confessed to some distress of mind. He had been called in by\nhis colleague for consultation in the case of a girl, Rosalie Sarrazin,\nservant to an eminent professor of law, M. Bidard. In spite of the\nministrations of himself and his colleague, Rosalie had died. The\nsymptoms of the illness had been very much the same as in the case of a\nformer servant of M. Bidard's, a girl named Rose Tessier, who had also\ndied. With this in mind they had persuaded the relatives of Rosalie to\npermit an autopsy. They had to confess that they had found no trace of\npoison in the body, but they were still convinced the girl had died of\npoisoning. With his colleague backing him, Dr Pinault was able to put\nsuch facts before the Procureur-General that that official almost at\nonce reached for his hat to accompany the two doctors to M. Bidard's.\n\nThe door of the Professor's house was opened to them by Helene Jegado,\nanother of M. Bidard's servants. She was a woman of forty odd, somewhat\nscraggy of figure and, while not exactly ugly, not prepossessing of\ncountenance. Her habit of looking anywhere but into the face of anyone\naddressing her gave her rather a furtive air.\n\nHaving ushered the three gentlemen into the presence of the Professor,\nthe servant-woman lingered by the door.\n\n\"We have come, M. Bidard,\" said the Procureur, \"on a rather painful\nmission. One of your servants died recently--it is suspected, of\npoisoning.\"\n\n\"I am innocent!\"\n\nThe three visitors wheeled to stare, with the Professor, at the\ngrey-faced woman in the doorway. It was she who had made the\nexclamation.\n\n\"Innocent of what?\" demanded the Law officer. \"No one has accused you of\nanything!\"\n\nThis incautious remark on the part of the servant, together with the\nfacts already put before him by the two doctors and the information\nhe obtained from her employer, led the Procureur-General to have her\narrested. Helene Jegado's past was inquired into, and a strange and\ndreadful Odyssey the last twenty years of her life proved to be. It was\nan Odyssey of death.\n\nHelene was born at Plouhinec, department of Morbihan, on (according to\nthe official record) \"28 prairial,\" in the eleventh year of the republic\n(1803). Orphaned at the age of seven, she was sheltered by the cure of\nBubry, M. Raillau, with whom two of her aunts were servants. Sixteen\nyears later one of those aunts, Helene Liscouet, took Helene with her\ninto service with M. Conan, cure at Seglien, and it was here that Helene\nJegado's evil ways would appear first to become manifest. A girl looking\nafter the cure's sheep declared she had found grains of hemp in soup\nprepared for her by Helene.\n\nIt was not, however, until 1833 that causing death is laid at her\ncharge.\n\nIn that year she entered the service of a priest in Guern, one Le Drogo.\nIn the space of little more than three months, from the 28th of June to\nthe 3rd of October, seven persons in the priest's household died. All\nthose people died after painful vomitings, and all of them had eaten\nfood prepared by Helene, who nursed each of them to the last. The\nvictims of this fatal outbreak of sickness included Helene's own sister\nAnna (apparently on a visit to Guern from Bubry), the rector's father\nand mother, and Le Drogo himself. This last, a strong and vigorous man,\nwas dead within thirty-two hours of the first onset of his illness.\nHelene, it was said, showed the liveliest sorrow over each of the\ndeaths, but on the death of the rector was heard to say, \"This won't be\nthe last!\" Nor was it. Two deaths followed that of Le Drogo.\n\nSuch a fatal outbreak did not pass without suspicion. The body of\nthe rector was examined by Dr Galzain, who found indications of grave\ndisorder in the digestive tracts, with inflammation of the intestines.\nHis colleague, Dr Martel, had suspicions of poison, but the pious sorrow\nof Helene lulled his mind as far as she was concerned.\n\nWe next find Helene returned to Bubry, replacing her sister Anna in the\nservice of the cure there. In three months three people died: Helene's\naunt Marie-Jeanne Liscouet and the cure's niece and sister. This last,\na healthy girl of about sixteen, was dead within four days, and it is to\nbe noted that during her brief illness she drank nothing but milk from\nthe hands of Helene. But here, as hitherto, Helene attended all the\nsufferers. Her grief over their deaths impressed every one with whom she\ncame in contact.\n\nFrom Bubry Helene went to Locmine. Her family connexion as servants with\nthe clergy found her room for three days in the rectory, after which\nshe became apprentice to a needlewoman of the town, one Marie-Jeanne\nLeboucher, with whom she lived. The Widow Leboucher was stricken ill, as\nalso was one of her daughters. Both died. The son of the house, Pierre,\nalso fell ill. But, not liking Helene, he refused her ministrations, and\nrecovered. By this time Helene had become somewhat sensitive.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" she said to a male relative of the deceased sempstress,\n\"that people will accuse me of all those deaths. Death follows me\nwherever I go.\" She quitted the Leboucher establishment in distress.\n\nA widow of the same town offered her house room. The widow died, having\neaten soup of Helene's preparing. On the day following the Widow Lorey's\ndeath her niece, Veuve Cadic, arrived. The grief-stricken Helene threw\nherself into the niece's arms.\n\n\"My poor girl!\" exclaimed the Veuve Cadic.\n\n\"Ai--but I'm so unhappy!\" Helene grieved. \"Where-ever I go--Seglien,\nGuern, Bubry, Veuve Laboucher's--people die!\"\n\nShe had cause for grief, sure enough. In less than eighteen months\nthirteen persons with whom she had been closely associated had died of\nviolent sickness. But more were to follow.\n\nIn May of 1835 Helene was in service with the Dame Toussaint, of\nLocmine. Four more people died. They were the Dame's confidential maid,\nAnne Eveno, M. Toussaint pere, a daughter of the house, Julie, and,\nlater, Mme Toussaint herself. They had eaten vegetable soup prepared by\nHelene Jegado. Something tardily the son of the house, liking neither\nHelene's face nor the deathly rumours that were rife about her,\ndismissed her.\n\nTo one as burdened with sorrow as Helene Jegado appeared to be the life\nconventual was bound to hold appeal. She betook herself to the pleasant\nlittle town of Auray, which sits on a sea arm behind the nose of\nQuiberon, and sought shelter in the convent of the Eternal Father there.\nShe was admitted as a pensionnaire. Her sojourn in the convent did not\nlast long, for queer disorders marked her stay. Linen in the convent\ncupboards and the garments of the pupils were maliciously slashed.\nHelene was suspect and was packed off.\n\nOnce again Helene became apprentice to a sempstress, this time an old\nmaid called Anne Lecouvrec, proprietress of the Bonnes-oeuvres in Auray.\nThe ancient lady, seventy-seven years of age, tried Helene's soup. She\ndied two days later. To a niece of the deceased Helene made moan: \"Ah! I\ncarry sorrow. My masters die wherever I go!\"\n\nThe realization, however, did not prevent Helene from seeking further\nemployment. She next got a job with a lady named Lefur in Ploermel,\nand stayed for a month. During that time Helene's longing for the life\nreligious found frequent expression, and she ultimately departed to pay\na visit, so she said, to the good sisters of the Auray community. Some\ntime before her departure, however, she persuaded Anne Lefur to accept a\ndrink of her preparing, and Anne, hitherto a healthy woman, became very\nill indeed. In this case Helene did not show her usual solicitude. She\nrather heartlessly abandoned the invalid--which would appear to have\nbeen a good thing for the invalid, for, lacking Helene's ministrations,\nshe got better.\n\nHelene meantime had found a place in Auray with a lady named Hetel. The\njob lasted only a few days. Mme Hetel's son-in-law, M. Le Dore, having\nheard why Helene was at need to leave the convent of the Eternal Father,\nshowed her the door of the house. That was hasty, but not hasty enough.\nHis mother-in-law, having already eaten meats cooked by Helene, was\nin the throes of the usual violent sickness, and died the day after\nHelene's departure.\n\nFailing to secure another place in Auray, Helene went to Pontivy, and\ngot a position as cook in the household of the Sieur Jouanno. She had\nbeen there some few months when the son of the house, a boy of fourteen,\ndied after a sickness of five days that was marked by vomiting and\nconvulsions. In this case an autopsy was immediately held. It revealed\nan inflamed condition of the stomach and some corrosion of the\nintestines. But the boy had been known to be a vinegar-drinker, and the\npathological conditions discovered by the doctor were attributed by him\nto the habit.\n\nHelene's next place was with a M. Kerallic in Hennebont. M. Kerallic was\nrecovering from a fever. After drinking a tisane prepared by Helene he\nhad a relapse, followed by repeated and fierce vomiting that destroyed\nhim in five days. This was in 1836. After that the trail of death which\nhad followed Helene's itineracy about the lower section of the Brittany\npeninsula was broken for three years.\n\nIn 1839 we hear of her again, in the house of the Dame Veron, where\nanother death occurred, again with violent sickness.\n\nTwo years elapse. In 1841 Helene was in Lorient, domestic servant to a\nmiddle-aged couple named Dupuyde-Lome, with whom lived their daughter\nand her husband, a M. Breger. First the little daughter of the young\ncouple died, then all the members of the family were seized by illness,\nits onset being on the day following the death of the child. No more\nof the family died, but M. Dupuy and his daughter suffered from bodily\nnumbness for years afterwards, with partial paralysis and recurrent\npains in the extremities.\n\nHelene seems to have made Lorient too hot for herself, and had to go\nelsewhere. Port Louis is her next scene of action. A kinswoman of her\nmaster in this town, one Duperron, happened to miss a sheet from\nthe household stock. Mlle Leblanc charged Helene with the theft, and\ndemanded the return of the stolen article. It is recorded that Helene\nrefused to give it up, and her answer is curious.\n\n\"I am going into retreat,\" she declared. \"God has forgiven me my sins!\"\n\nThere was perhaps something prophetic in the declaration. By the time\nHelene was brought to trial, in 1854, her sins up to this point of\nrecord were covered by the prescription legale, a sort of statute of\nlimitations in French law covering crime. Between 1833 and 1841 the\nwanderings of Helene Jegado through those quiet Brittany towns had been\nmarked by twenty-three deaths, six illnesses, and numerous thefts.\n\nThere is surcease to Helene's death-dealing between the years of\n1841 and 1849, but on the inquiries made after her arrest a myriad of\naccusers sprang up to tell of thefts during that time. They were petty\nthefts, but towards the end of the period they begin to indicate a\nchange in Helene's habits. She seems to have taken to drink, for her\nthefts are mostly of wine and eau de vie.\n\nIn March 1848 Helene was in Rennes. On the 6th of November of the\nfollowing year, having been dismissed from several houses for theft,\nshe became sole domestic servant to a married couple called Rabot. Their\nson, Albert, who was already ill, died in the end of December. He had\neaten a farina porridge cooked by Helene. In the following February,\nhaving discovered Helene's depredations from the wine-cupboard, M. Rabot\ngave her notice. This was on the 3rd of the month. (Helene was to leave\non the 13th.) The next day Mme Rabot and Rabot himself, having taken\nsoup of Helene's making, became very ill. Rabot's mother-in-law ate a\npanade prepared by Helene. She too fell ill. They all recovered after\nHelene had departed, but Rabot, like M. Dupuy-de-Lome, was partially\nparalysed for months afterwards.\n\nIn Helene's next situation, with people called Ozanne, her way of\nabstracting liquor again was noticed. She was chided for stealing eau\nde vie. Soon after that the Ozannes' little son died suddenly, very\nsuddenly. The doctor called in thought it was from a croup fever.\n\nOn the day following the death of the little Ozanne Helene entered the\nservice of M. Roussell, proprietor of the Bout-du-Monde hotel in Rennes.\nSome six weeks later Roussell's mother suddenly became ill. She had had\noccasion to reproach Helene for sullen ill-manners or something of that\nsort. She ate some potage which Helene had cooked. The illness that\nensued lasted a long time. Eighteen months later the old lady had hardly\nrecovered.\n\nIn the hotel with Helene as fellow-servant there was a woman of thirty,\nPerrotte Mace, very greatly relied upon by her masters, with whom she\nhad been five years. She was a strongly built woman who carried herself\nfinely. Perrotte openly agreed with the Veuve Roussell regarding\nHelene's behaviour. This, with the confidence reposed in Perrotte by the\nRoussells, might have been enough to set Helene against her. But there\nwas an additional cause for jealousy: Jean Andre, the hotel ostler, but\nalso described as a cabinet-maker, though friendly enough with Helene,\nshowed a marked preference for the younger, and comelier, Perrotte. The\nVeuve Roussell fell ill in the middle of June. In August Perrotte was\nseized by a similar malady, and, in spite of all her resistance, had to\ntake to her bed. Vomiting and purging marked the course of her illness,\npains in the stomach and limbs, distension of the abdomen, and swelling\nof the feet. With her strong constitution she put up a hard fight for\nher life, but succumbed on the 1st of September, 1850. The doctors\ncalled in, MM. Vincent and Guyot, were extremely puzzled by the course\nof the illness. At times the girl would seem to be on the mend, then\nthere would come a sudden relapse. After Perrotte's death they pressed\nfor an autopsy, but the peasant relatives of the girl showed the usual\nrepugnance of their class to the idea. Helene was taken red-handed\nin the theft of wine, and was dismissed. Fifteen days later she took\nservice with the Bidards.\n\nThese are the salient facts of Helene's progression from 1833 to 1851 as\nbrought out by the investigations made by and for the Procureur-General\nof Rennes. All possible channels were explored to discover where Helene\nhad procured the arsenic, but without success. Under examination by the\nJuge d'instruction she stoutly denied all knowledge of the poison. \"I\ndon't know anything about arsenic--don't know what it is,\" she repeated.\n\"No witness can say I ever had any.\" It was believed that she had\nsecured a large supply in her early days, and had carried it with her\nthrough the years, but that at the first definite word of suspicion\nagainst her had got rid of it. During her trial mention was made of\npackets found in a chest she had used while at Locsine, the place where\nseven deaths had occurred. But it was never clearly established that\nthese packets had contained arsenic. It was never clearly established,\nthough it could be inferred, that Helene ever had arsenic at all.\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe first hearings of Helene's case were taken before the Juge\nd'instruction in Rennes, and she was remanded to the assizes for\nIlle-et-Vilaine, which took place, apparently, in the same city. The\ncharges against her were limited to eleven thefts, three murders by\npoisoning, and three attempts at murder by the like means. Under the\nprescription legale twenty-three poisonings, six attempts at poisoning,\nand a number of thefts, all of which had taken place within the space of\nten years, had to be left out of the indictment. We shall see, however,\nthat, under the curious rules regarding permissible evidence which\nprevail in French criminal law, the Assize Court concerned itself quite\nlargely with this prescribed matter.\n\nThe trial began on the 6th of December, 1851, at a time when France was\nin a political uproar--or, more justly perhaps, was settling down from\npolitical uproar. The famous coup d'etat of that year had happened four\ndays before. Maitre Dorange, defending Helene, asked for a remand to\na later session on the ground that some of his material witnesses were\nunavailable owing to the political situation. An eminent doctor, M.\nBaudin, had died \"pour maintien des lois.\" There was some argument on\nthe matter, but the President ruled that all material witnesses were\npresent. Scientific experts could be called only to assist the court.\n\nThe business of this first day was taken up almost completely by\nquestions on the facts produced in investigation, and these mostly facts\ncovered by the prescription. The legal value of this run of questions\nwould seem doubtful in the Anglo-Saxon idea of justice, but it gives\nan indication of the shiftiness in answer of the accused. It was a long\ninterrogation, but Helene faced it with notable self-possession. On\noccasion she answered with vigour, but in general sombrely and with\nlowered eyes. At times she broke into volubility. This did not serve to\nremove the impression of shiftiness, for her answers were seldom to the\npoint.\n\nWasn't it true, she was asked, that in Locmine she had been followed and\ninsulted with cries: \"C'est la femme au foie blanc; elle porte la mort\navec elle!\"? Nobody had ever said anything of the sort to her, was\nher sullen answer. A useless denial. There were plenty of witnesses to\nexpress their belief in her \"white liver\" and to tell of her reputation\nof carrying death.\n\nAsked why she had been dismissed from the convent at Auray, she answered\nthat she did not know. The Mother Superior had told her to go. She had\nbeen too old to learn reading and writing. Pressed on the point of the\nslashed garments of the pupils and the linen in the convent cupboards,\nHelene retorted that somebody had cut her petticoats as well, and that,\nanyhow, the sisters had never accused her of working the mischief.\n\nThis last answer was true in part. The evidence on which Helene had been\ndismissed the convent was circumstantial. A sister from the community\ndescribed Helene's behaviour otherwise as edifying indeed.\n\nAfter the merciless fashion of French judges, the President came back\ntime and again to attack Helene on the question of poison. If Perrotte\nMace did not get the poison from her--from whom, then?\n\n\"I don't know anything of poison,\" was the reply, with the pious\naddendum, \"and, God willing, I never will!\"\n\nThis, with variations, was her constant answer.\n\n\"Qu'est-ce que c'est l'arsenic? Je n'en ai jamais vu d'arsenic, moi!\"\n\nThe President had occasion later to take her up on these denials. The\ncurate of Seglien came to give evidence. He had been curate during the\ntime of M. Conan, in whose service Helene had been at that time. He\ncould swear that M. Conan had repeatedly told his servants to watch that\nthe domestic animals did not get at the poisoned bait prepared for the\nrats. M. Conan's servants had complete access to the arsenic used.\n\nHelene interposed at this point. \"I know,\" she said, \"that M. Conan had\nasked for arsenic, but I wasn't there at the time. My aunt told me about\nit.\"\n\nThe President reminded her that in her interrogaion she had declared\nshe knew nothing of arsenic, nor had heard anyone speak of it. Helene\nsullenly persisted in her first declaration, but modified it with the\nadmission that her aunt had told her the stuff was dangerous, and not to\nbe used save with the strictest precautions.\n\nThis evidence of the arsenic at Seglien was brought forward on the\nsecond day of the trial, when witnesses began to be heard. Before\npursuing the point of where the accused might have obtained the poison I\nshould like to quote, as typical of the hypocritical piety exhibited by\nHelene, one of her answers on the first day.\n\nAfter reminding her that Rose Tessier's sickness had increased after\ntaking a tisane that Helene had prepared the President asked if it was\nnot the fact that she alone had looked after Rose.\n\n\"No,\" Helen replied. \"Everybody was meddling. All I did was put\nthe tisane on to boil. I have suffered a great deal,\" she added\ngratuitously. \"The good God will give me grace to bear up to the end. If\nI have not died of my sufferings in prison it is because God's hand has\nguided and sustained me.\"\n\nWith that in parenthesis, let us return to the evidence of the witnesses\non the second day of the trial. A great deal of it had to do with\ndeaths on which, under the prescription, no charge could be made\nagainst Helene, and with thefts that equally could not be the subject of\naccusation.\n\nDr Galzain, of Ponivy, who, eighteen years before, had performed the\nautopsy on Le Drogo, cure of Guern, testified that though he had then\nbeen puzzled by the pathological conditions, he was now prepared to say\nthey were consistent with arsenical poisoning.\n\nMartel, a pharmacist, brother of the doctor who had attended Le Drogo,\nspoke of his brother's suspicions, suspicions which had recurred on\nmeeting with the cases at Bubry. They had been diverted by the lavishly\naffectionate attendance Helene had given to the sufferers.\n\nRelatives of the victims of Locmine told of Helene's predictions of\ndeath, and of her plaints that death followed her everywhere. They also\nremarked on the very kind ministrations of Helene.\n\nDr Toussaint, doctor at Locmine, and son to the house in which Helene\nhad for a time been servant, told of his perplexity over the symptoms\nin the cases of the Widow Lorey and the youth Leboucher. In 1835 he\nhad been called in to see Helene herself, who was suffering from an\nintermittent fever. Next day the fever had disappeared. He was told that\nshe had been dosing herself, and he was shown a packet which had been\nin her possession. It contained substances that looked like\nkermes-mineral,[30] some saffron, and a white powder that amounted to\nperhaps ten grammes. He had disliked Helene at first sight. She had not\nbeen long in his mother's service when his mother's maid-companion (Anne\nEveno), who also had no liking for Helene, fell ill and died. His\nfather fell violently ill in turn, seemed to get better, and looked like\nrecovering. But inexplicable complications supervened, and his father\ndied suddenly of a haemorrhage of the intestinal canal. His sister\nJulie, who had been the first to fall sick, also seemed to recover, but\nafter the death of the father had a relapse. In his idea Helene, having\ncured herself, was able to drug the invalids in her care. The witness\nordered her to be kept completely away from the sufferers, but one night\nshe contrived to get the nurses out of the way. A confrere he called in\nordered bouillon to be given. Helene had charge of the kitchen, and it\nwas she who prepared the bouillon. It was she who administered it. Three\nhours later his sister died in agony.\n\n\nThe witness suggested an autopsy. His family would not agree. The pious\nbehaviour of Helene put her beyond suspicion, but he took it on himself\nto dismiss her. During the illness of his father, when Helene herself\nwas ill, he went reluctantly to see her, being told that she was dying.\nInstead of finding her in bed he came upon her making some sort of white\nsauce. As soon as he appeared she threw herself into bed and pretended\nto be suffering intense pain. A little later he asked to see the sauce.\nIt had disappeared.\n\nHe had advised his niece to reserve his sister's evacuations. His niece\nreplied that Helene was so scrupulously tidy that such vessels were\nnever left about, but were taken away at once to be emptied and cleaned.\n\"I revised my opinion of the woman after she had gone,\" added the\nwitness. \"I thought her very well behaved.\"\n\n\nHELENE. I never had any drugs in my possession--never. When I had fever\nI took the powders given me by the doctor, but I did not know what they\nwere!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Why did you say yesterday that nothing was ever found in\nyour luggage?\n\nHELENE. I didn't remember.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. What were you doing with the saffron? Wasn't it in your\npossession during the time you were in Seglien?\n\nHELENE. I was taking it for my blood.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. And the white powder--did it also come from Seglien?\n\nHELENE [energetically]. Never have I had white powder in my luggage!\nNever have I seen arsenic! Never has anyone spoken to me of arsenic!\n\nUpon this the President rightly reminded her that she had said only that\nmorning that her aunt had talked to her of arsenic at Seglien, and had\nwarned her of its lethal qualities. \"You deny the existence of that\nwhite powder,\" said the President, \"because you know it was poison. You\nput it away from you with horror!\"\n\nThe accused several times tried to answer this charge, but failed. Her\nface was beaded with moisture.\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Had you or had you not any white powder at Losmine?\n\nHELENE. I can't say if I still had fever there.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. What was that powder? When did you first have it?\n\nHELENE. I had taken it at Locmine. Somebody gave it to me for two sous.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Why didn t you say so at the beginning, instead of\nwaiting until you are confounded by the witness? [To Dr Toussaint]\nWhat would the powder be, monsieur? What powder would one prescribe for\nfever?\n\nDR TOUSSAINT. Sulphate of quinine; but that's not what it was.\n\n\nQuestioned by the advocate for the defence, the witness said he would\nnot affirm that the powder he saw was arsenic. His present opinion,\nhowever, was that his father and sister had died from injections of\narsenic in small doses.\n\nA witness from Locmine spoke of her sister's two children becoming ill\nafter taking chocolate prepared by the accused. The latter told her\nthat a mob had followed her in the street, accusing her of the deaths of\nthose she had been servant to.\n\nThen came one of those curious samples of 'what the soldier said' that\nare so often admitted in French criminal trials as evidence. Louise\nClocher said she had seen Helene on the road between Auray and Lorient\nin the company of a soldier. When she told some one of it people said,\n\"That wasn't a soldier! It was the devil you saw following her!\"\n\nOne rather sympathizes with Helene in her protest against this\ntestimony.\n\nFrom Ploermel, Auray, Lorient, and other places doctors and relatives\nof the dead came to bear witness to Helene's cooking and nursing\nactivities, and to speak of the thefts she had been found committing.\nWhere any suspicion had touched Helene her piety and her tender care of\nthe sufferers had disarmed it. The astonishing thing is that, with all\nthose rumours of 'white livers' and so on, the woman could proceed from\nplace to place within a few miles of each other, and even from house to\nhouse in the same towns, leaving death in her tracks, without once being\nbrought to bay. Take the evidence of M. Le Dore, son-in-law of that\nMme Hetel who died in Auray, His mother-in-law became ill just after\nHelene's reputation was brought to his notice. The old lady died next\nday.\n\n\"The day following the revelation,\" said M. Le Dore, \"I put Helene out.\nShe threw herself on the ground uttering fearsome yells. The day's meal\nhad been prepared. I had it thrown out, and put Helene herself to the\ndoor with her luggage, INTO WHICH SHE HASTILY STOWED A PACKET. Mme Hetel\ndied next day in fearful agony.\"\n\nI am responsible for the italicizing. It is hard to understand why M. Le\nDore did no more than put Helene to the door. He was suspicious enough\nto throw out the meal prepared by Helene, and he saw her hastily stow a\npacket in her luggage. But, though he was Mayor of Auray, he did nothing\nmore about his mother-in-law's death. It is to be remarked, however,\nthat the Hetels themselves were against the brusque dismissal of Helene.\nShe had \"smothered the mother with care and attentions.\"\n\nBut one gets perhaps the real clue to Helene's long immunity from the\nremark made in court by M. Breger, son-in-law of that Lorient couple, M.\nand Mme Dupuyde-Lome. He had thought for a moment of suspecting Helene\nof causing the child's death and the illness of the rest of the family,\nbut \"there seemed small grounds. What interest had the girl in cutting\noff their lives?\"\n\nIt is a commonplace that murder without motive is the hardest to\ndetect. The deaths that Helene Jegado contrived between 1833 and 1841,\ntwenty-three in number, and the six attempts at murder which she made\nin that length of time, are, without exception, crimes quite lacking in\ndiscoverable motive. It is not at all on record that she had reason for\nwishing to eliminate any one of those twenty-three persons. She seems to\nhave poisoned for the mere sake of poisoning. Save to the ignorant and\nsuperstitious, such as followed her in the streets to accuse her\nof having a \"white liver\" and a breath that meant death, she was an\nunfortunate creature with an odd knack of finding herself in houses\nwhere 'accidents' happened. Time and again you find her being taken in\nby kindly people after such 'accidents,' and made an object of sympathy\nfor the dreadful coincidences that were making her so unhappy. It was\nout of sympathy that the Widow Lorey, of Locmine, took Helene into\nher house. On the widow's death the niece arrived. In court the niece\ndescribed the scene on her arrival. \"Helene embraced me,\" she said.\n\"'Unhappy me!' she wept. 'Wherever I go everybody dies!' I pitied and\nconsoled her.\" She pitied and consoled Helene, though they were saying\nin the town that the girl had a white liver and that her breath brought\ndeath!\n\nWhere Helene had neglected to combine her poisoning with detected\npilfering the people about her victims could see nothing wrong in\nher conduct. Witness after witness--father, sister, husband, niece,\nson-in-law, or relation in some sort to this or that victim of\nHelene's--repeated in court, \"The girl went away with nothing against\nher.\" And even those who afterwards found articles missing from their\nhousehold goods: \"At the same time I did not suspect her probity. She\nwent to Mass every morning and to the evening services. I was very\nsurprised to find some of my napkins among the stuff Helene was accused\nof stealing.\"\n\n\"I did not know of Helene's thefts until I was shown the objects\nstolen,\" said a lady of Vannes. \"Without that proof I would never have\nsuspected the girl. Helene claimed affiliation with a religious\nsisterhood, served very well, and was a worker.\"\n\nIt is perhaps of interest to note how Helene answered the testimony\nregarding her thieving proclivities. Mme Lejoubioux, of Vannes, said her\nfurnishing bills went up considerably during the time Helene was in her\nservice. Helene had purloined two cloths.\n\nHelene: \"That was for vengeance. I was furious at being sent away.\"\n\nSieur Cesar le Clerc and Mme Gauthier swore to thefts from them by\nHelene.\n\nHelene: \"I stole nothing from Mme Gauthier except one bottle of wine. If\nI commit a larceny it is from choler. WHEN I'M FURIOUS I STEAL!\"\n\nIt was when Helene began to poison for vengeance that retribution fell\nupon her. Her fondness for the bottle started to get her into trouble.\nIt made her touchy. Up to 1841 she had poisoned for the pleasure of it,\nmasking her secret turpitude with an outward show of piety, of being\nhelpful in time of trouble. By the time she arrived in Rennes, in 1848,\nafter seven years during which her murderous proclivities seem to\nhave slept, her character as a worker, if not as a Christian, had\ndeteriorated. Her piety, in the face of her fondness for alcohol and\nher slovenly habits, and against her now frequently exhibited bursts of\ntemper and ill-will, appeared the hypocrisy it actually was. Her essays\nin poisoning now had purpose and motive behind them. Nemesis, so long at\nher heels, overtook her.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nIt is not clear in the accounts available to me just what particular\nmurders by poison, what attempts at poisoning, and what thefts Helene\nwas charged with in the indictment at Rennes. Twenty-three poisonings,\nsix attempts, and a number of thefts had been washed out, it may be\nas well to repeat, by the prescription legale. But from her arrival in\nRennes, leaving the thefts out of account, her activities had accounted\nfor the following: In the Rabot household one death (Albert, the son)\nand three illnesses (Rabot, Mme Rabot, the mother-in-law); in the Ozanne\nestablishment one death (that of the little son), in the hotel of the\nRoussells one death (that of Perrotte Mace) and one illness (that of\nthe Veuve Roussell); at the Bidards two deaths (Rose Tessier and Rosalie\nSarrazin). In this last establishment there was also one attempt at\npoisoning which I have not yet mentioned, that of a young servant, named\nFrancoise Huriaux, who for a short time had taken the place of Rose\nTessier. We thus have five deaths and five attempts in Rennes, all\nof which could be indictable. But, as already stated, the indictment\ncovered three deaths and three attempts.\n\nIt is hard to say, from verbatim reports of the trial, where the matter\nof the indictment begins to be handled. It would seem from the evidence\nproduced that proof was sought of all five deaths and all five attempts\nthat Helene was supposed to be guilty of in Rennes. The father of the\nboy Ozanne was called before the Rabot witnesses, though the Rabot death\nand illnesses occurred before the death of the Ozanne child. We may,\nhowever, take the order of affairs as dealt with in the court. We\nmay see something of motive on Helene's part suggested in M. Ozanne's\nevidence, and an indication of her method of covering her crime.\n\nM. Ozanne said that Helene, in his house, drank eau de vie in secret,\nand, to conceal her thefts, filled the bottle up with cider. He\ndiscovered the trick, and reproached Helene for it. She denied the\naccusation with vigour, and angrily announced her intention of leaving.\nMme Ozanne took pity on Helene, and told her she might remain several\ndays longer. On the Tuesday following the young child became ill. The\nillness seemed to be a fleeting one, and the father and mother thought\nhe had recovered. On the Saturday, however, the boy was seized by\nvomiting, and the parents wondered if they should send for the doctor.\n\"If the word was mine,\" said Helene, who had the boy on her knees, \"and\nthe child as ill as he looks, I should not hesitate.\" The doctor was\nsent for about noon on Sunday. He thought it only a slight illness.\nTowards evening the child began to complain of pain all over his body.\nHis hands and feet were icy cold. His body grew taut. About six o'clock\nthe doctor came back. \"My God!\" he exclaimed. \"It's the croup!\" He tried\nto apply leeches, but the boy died within a few minutes. Helene hastened\nthe little body into its shroud.\n\nHelene, said Ozanne, always talked of poison if anyone left their food.\n\"Do you think I'm poisoning you?\" she would ask.\n\nA girl named Cambrai gave evidence that Helene, coming away from the\ncemetery after the burial of the child, said to her, \"I am not so sorry\nabout the child. Its parents have treated me shabbily.\" The witness\nthought Helene too insensitive and reproached her.\n\n\"That's a lie!\" the accused shouted. \"I loved the child!\"\n\nThe doctor, M. Brute, gave evidence next. He still believed the child\nhad died of a croup affection, the most violent he had ever seen. The\nPresident questioned him closely on the symptoms he had seen in the\nchild, but the doctor stuck to his idea. He had seen nothing to make him\nsuspect poisoning.\n\nThe President: \"It is strange that in all the cases we have under review\nthe doctors saw nothing at first that was serious. They admit illness\nand prescribe mild remedies, and then, suddenly, the patients get worse\nand die.\"\n\nM. Victor Rabot was called next. To begin with, he said, Helene's\nservices were satisfactory. He had given her notice because he found her\nstealing his wine. Upon this Helene showed the greatest discontent, and\nit was then that Mme Rabot fell ill. A nurse was put in charge of her,\nbut Helene found a way to get rid of her. Helene had no love for his\nchild. The child had a horror of the servant, because she was dirty and\ntook snuff. In consequence Helene had a spite against the boy. Helene\nhad never been seen eating any of the dishes prepared for the family,\nand even insisted on keeping certain of the kitchen dishes for her own\nuse.\n\nAt the request of his father-in-law Helene had gone to get a bottle\nof violet syrup from the pharmacist. The bottle was not capped. His\nfather-in-law thought the syrup had gone bad, because it was as red as\nmulberry syrup, and refused to give it to his daughter (Mme Rabot). The\nbottle was returned to the pharmacist, who remarked that the colour of\nthe syrup had changed, and that he did not recognize it as his own.\n\nMme Rabot having corroborated her husband's evidence, and told of\nHelene's bad temper, thieving, and disorderliness, Dr Vincent Guyot, of\nRennes, was called.\n\nDr Guyot described the illness of the boy Albert and its result. He then\nwent on to describe the illness of Mme Rabot. He and his confreres had\nattributed her sickness to the fact that she was enceinte, and to\nthe effect of her child's death upon her while in that condition. A\nmiscarriage of a distressing nature confirmed the first prognosis. But\nlater he and his confreres saw reason to change their minds. He believed\nthe boy had been poisoned, though he could not be certain. The mother,\nhe was convinced, had been the victim of an attempt at poisoning, an\nopinion which found certainty in the case of Mme Briere. If Mme Rabot's\npregnancy went some way in explaining her illness there was nothing of\nthis in the illness of her mother. The explanation of everything was in\nrepeated dosing of an arsenical substance.\n\nThe witness had also attended Mme Roussell, of the Bout-du-Monde hotel.\nIt was remarkable that the violent sickness to which this lady was\nsubject for twenty days did not answer to treatment, but stopped only\nwhen she gave up taking food prepared for her by Helene Jegado.\n\nHe had also looked after Perrotte Mace. Here also he had had doubts\nof the nature of the malady; at one time he had suspected pregnancy, a\nsuspicion for which there were good grounds. But the symptoms that later\ndeveloped were not consistent with the first diagnosis. When Perrotte\ndied he and M. Revault, his confrere, thought the cause of death would\nbe seen as poison in an autopsy. But the post-mortem was rejected by the\nparents. His feeling to-day was that Mme Roussell's paralysis was due\nto arsenical dosage, and that Perrotte had died of poisoning. Helene,\nspeaking to him of Perrotte, had said, \"She's a chest subject. She'll\nnever get better!\" And she had used the same phrase, \"never get better,\"\nwith regard to little Rabot.\n\nM. Morio, the pharmacist of Rennes from whom the violet syrup was\nbought, said that Helene had often complained to him about Mme Roussell.\nDuring the illness of the Rabot boy she had said that the child was\nworse than anyone imagined, and that he would never recover. In the\nmatter of the violet syrup he agreed it had come back to him looking\nred. The bottle had been put to one side, but its contents had been\nthrown away, and he had therefore been unable to experiment with it.\nHe had found since, however, that arsenic in powder form did not turn\nviolet syrup red, though possibly arsenic in solution with boiling water\nmight produce the effect. The change seen in the syrup brought back from\nM. Rabot's was not to be accounted for by such fermentation as the mere\nwarmth of the hand could bring about.\n\nSeveral witnesses, interrupted by denials and explanations from the\naccused, testified to having heard Helene say that neither the Rabot boy\nnor his mother would recover.\n\nThe evidence of M. Roussell, of the Bout-du-Monde hotel, touched on\nthe illnesses of his mother and Perrotte. He knew nothing of the food\nprepared by Helene; nor had the idea of poison occurred to him until her\narrest. Helene's detestable character, her quarrels with other servants,\nand, above all, the thefts of wine he had found her out in were the sole\ncauses of her dismissal. He had noticed that Helene never ate with the\nother domestics. She always found an excuse for not doing so. She said\nshe had stomach trouble and could not hold down her food.\n\nThe Veuve Roussell had to be helped into court by her son. She dealt\nwith her own illness and with the death of Perrotte. Her illness did not\ncome on until she had scolded Helene for her bad ways.\n\nDr Revault, confrere of Guyot, regretted the failure to perform a\npost-mortem on the body of Perrotte. He had said to Roussell that if\nPerrotte's illness was analogous to cholera it was, nevertheless, not\nthat disease. He believed it was due to a poison.\n\nThe President: \"Chemical analysis has proved the presence of arsenic in\nthe viscera of Perrotte. Who administered that arsenic, the existence of\nwhich was so shrewdly foreseen by the witness? Who gave her the arsenic?\n[To Helene] Do you know? Was it not you that gave it her, Helene?\"\n\nAt this Helene murmured something unintelligible, but, gathering her\nvoice, she protested, \"I have never had arsenic in my hands, Monsieur le\nPresident--never!\"\n\nSomething of light relief was provided by Jean Andre, the cabinet-making\nostler of Saint-Gilles, he for whose attention Helene had been a rival\nwith Perrotte Mace.\n\n\"The service Helene gave was excellent. So was mine. She nursed Perrotte\nperfectly, but said it was in vain, because the doctors were mishandling\nthe disease. She told me one day that she was tired of service, and that\nher one wish was to retire.\"\n\n\"Did you attach a certain idea to the confidence about retiring?\"\n\n\"No!\" Andre replied energetically.\n\n\"You were in hospital. When you came back, did Helene take good care of\nyou?\"\n\n\"She gave me bouillon every morning to build me up.\"\n\n\"The bouillon she gave you did you no harm?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it did me a lot of good.\"\n\n\"Wasn't the accused jealous of Perrotte--that good-looking girl who gave\nyou so much of her favour?\"\n\n\"In her life Perrotte was a good girl. She never was out of sorts for a\nmoment--never rubbed one the wrong way.\"\n\n\"Didn't Helene say to you that Perrotte would never recover?\"\n\n\"Yes, she said that. 'She's a lost woman,' she said; 'the doctors are\ngoing the wrong way with the disease.'\n\n\"All the same,\" Andre went on, \"Helene never ate with us. She worked\nnight and day, but ate in secret, I believe. Anyhow, a friend of mine\ntold me he'd once seen her eating a crust of bread, and chewing some\nother sort of food at the same time. As for me--I don't know; but I\ndon't think you can live without eating.\"\n\n\"I couldn't keep down what I ate,\" Helene interposed. \"I took some\nbouillon here and there; sometimes a mouthful of bread--nothing in\nsecret. I never thought of Andre in marriage--not him more than another.\nThat was all a joke.\"\n\nA number of witnesses, friends of Perrotte, who had seen her during her\nillness, spoke of the extreme dislike the girl had shown for Helene\nand for the liquids the latter prepared for her. Perrotte would say to\nHelene, \"But you're dirty, you ugly Bretonne!\" Perrotte had a horror of\nbouillon: \"Ah--these vegetable soups! I've had enough of them! It was\nwhat Helene gave me that night that made me ill!\" The witnesses did not\nunderstand all this, because the accused seemed to be very good to her\nfellow-servant. At the bedside Helene cried, \"Ah! What can I do that\nwill save you, my poor Perrotte?\" When Perrotte was dying she wanted to\nask Helene's pardon. Embracing the dying girl, the accused replied,\n\"Ah! There's no need for that, my poor Perrotte. I know you didn't mean\nanything.\"\n\nA witness telling of soup Helene had made for Perrotte, which the\ngirl declared to have been poisoned, it was asked what happened to the\nremainder of it. The President passed the question to Helene, who said\nshe had thrown it into the hearth.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nThe most complete and important testimony in the trial was given by M.\nTheophile Bidard, professor to the law faculty of Rennes.\n\nThe facts he had to bring forward, he said, had taken no significance\nin his mind until the last of them transpired. He would have to go back\ninto the past to trace them in their proper order.\n\nHe recalled the admission of Helene to his domestic staff and the good\nrecommendations on which he had engaged her. From the first Helene\nproved herself to have plenty of intelligence, and he had believed that\nher intelligence was combined with goodness of heart. This was because\nhe had heard that by her work she was supporting two small children, as\nwell as her poor old mother, who had no other means of sustenance.\n\n(The reader will recollect that Helene was orphaned at the age of\nseven.)\n\nNevertheless, said M. Bidard, Helene was not long in his household\nbefore her companion, Rose Tessier, began to suffer in plenty from the\nreal character of Helene Jegado.\n\nRose had had a fall, an accident which had left her with pains in her\nback. There were no very grave symptoms but Helene prognosticated dire\nresults. One night, when the witness was absent in the country, Helene\nrose from her bed, and, approaching her fellow-servant's room, called\nseveral times in a sepulchral voice, \"Rose, Rose!\" That poor girl took\nfright, and hid under the bedclothes, trembling.\n\nNext day Rose complained to witness, who took his domestics to task.\nHelene pretended it was the farm-boy who had perpetrated the bad joke.\nShe then declared that she herself had heard some one give a loud knock.\n\"I thought,\" she said, \"that I was hearing the call for poor Rose.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the 3rd of November, 1850, M. Bidard, who had been in the\ncountry, returned to Rennes. After dinner that day, a meal which she\nhad taken in common with Helene, Rose was seized with violent sickness.\nHelene lavished on her the most motherly attention. She made tea, and\nsat up the night with the invalid. In the morning, though she still\nfelt ill, Rose got up. Helene made tea for her again. Rose once more was\nsick, violently, and her sickness endured until the witness himself had\nadministered copious draughts of tea prepared by himself. Rose passed a\nfairly good night, and Dr Pinault, who was called in, saw nothing more\nin the sickness than some nervous affection. But on the day of the 5th\nthe vomitings returned. Helene exclaimed, \"The doctors do not understand\nthe disease. Rose is going to die!\" The prediction seemed foolish as far\nas immediate appearances were concemed, for Rose had an excellent pulse\nand no trace of fever.\n\nIn the night between Tuesday and Wednesday the patient was calm, but on\nthe morning of Wednesday she had vomitings with intense stomach pains.\nFrom this time on, said the witness, the life of Rose, which was to last\nonly thirty-six hours, was nothing but a long-drawn and heart-rending\ncry of agony. She drew her last breath on the Thursday evening at\nhalf-past five. During her whole illness, added M. Bidard, Rose was\nattended by none save Helene and himself.\n\nRose's mother came. In Rose the poor woman had lost a beloved child and\nher sole support. She was prostrated. Helene's grief seemed to equal\nthe mother's. Tears were ever in her eyes, and her voice trembled. Her\nexpressions of regret almost seemed to be exaggerated.\n\nThere was a moment when the witness had his doubts. It was on the way\nback from the cemetery. For a fleeting instant he thought that the\nshaking of Helene's body was more from glee than sorrow, and he\nmomentarily accused her in his mind of hypocrisy. But in the following\ndays Helene did nothing but talk of \"that poor Rose,\" and M. Bidard,\nbefore her persistence, could only believe he had been mistaken. \"Ah!\"\nHelene said. \"I loved her as I did that poor girl who died in the\nBout-du-Monde.\"\n\nThe witness wanted to find some one to take Rose's place. Helene tried\nto dissuade him. \"Never mind another femme de chambre,\" she said. \"I\nwill do everything.\" M. Bidard contented himself with engaging another\ngirl, Francoise Huriaux, strong neither in intelligence nor will, but\nnevertheless a sweet little creature. Not many days passed before Helene\nbegan to make the girl unhappy. \"It's a lazy-bones,\" Helene told the\nwitness. \"She does not earn her keep.\" (\"Le pain qu'elle mange, elle le\nvole.\") M. Bidard shut her up. That was his affair, he said.\n\nFrancoise meantime conceived a fear of Helene. She was so scared of\nthe older woman that she obeyed all her orders without resistance. The\nwitness, going into the kitchen one day, found Helene eating her soup\nat one end of the table, while Francoise dealt with hers at the other\nextreme. He told Helene that in future she was to serve the repast in\ncommon, on a tablecloth, and that it was to include dessert from his\ntable. This order seemed to vex Helene extremely. \"That girl seems to\nlive without eating,\" she said, \"and she never seems to sleep.\"\n\nOne day the witness noticed that the hands and face of Francoise were\npuffy. He spoke to Helene about it, who became angry. She accused her\ncompanion of getting up in the night to make tea, so wasting the sugar,\nand she swore she would lock the sugar up. M. Bidard told her to do\nnothing of the sort. He said if Francoise had need of sugar she was to\nhave it. \"All right--I see,\" Helene replied sullenly, obviously put out.\n\nThe swelling M. Bidard had seen in the face and hands of Francoise\nattacked her legs, and all service became impossible for the girl. The\nwitness was obliged to entrust Helene with the job of finding another\nchambermaid. It was then that she brought Rosalie Sarrazin to him. \"A\nvery good girl,\" she said. \"If her dress is poor it is because she gives\neverything to her mother.\"\n\nThe words, M. Bidard commented, were said by Helene with remarkable\nsincerity. It was said that Helene had no moral sense. It seemed to\nhim, from her expressions regarding that poor girl, who, like herself,\ndevoted herself to her mother, that Helene was far from lacking in that\nquality.\n\nEngaging Rosalie, the witness said to his new domestic, \"You will find\nyourself dealing with a difficult companion. Do not let her be insolent\nto you. You must assert yourself from the start. I do not want Helene to\nrule you as she ruled Francoise.\" At the same time he repeated his order\nregarding the service of the kitchen meals. Helene manifested a sullen\nopposition. \"Who ever heard of tablecloths for the servants?\" she said.\n\"It is ridiculous!\"\n\nIn the first days the tenderness between Helene and the new girl was\nquite touching. But circumstance arose to end the harmony. Rosalie could\nwrite. On the 23rd of May the witness told Helene that he would like her\nto give him an account of expenses. The request made Helene angry, and\nincreased her spite against the more educated Rosalie. Helene attempting\nto order Rosalie about, the latter laughingly told her, \"M. Bidard pays\nme to obey him. If I have to obey you also you'll have to pay me too.\"\nFrom that time Helene conceived an aversion from the girl.\n\nAbout the time when Helene began to be sour to Rosalie she herself was\nseized by vomitings. She complained to Mlle Bidard, a cousin of the\nwitness, that Rosalie neglected her. But when the latter went up to her\nroom Helene yelled at her, \"Get out, you ugly brute! In you I've brought\ninto the house a stick for my own back!\"\n\nThis sort of quarrelling went on without ceasing. At the beginning of\nJune the witness said to Helene, \"If this continues you'll have to look\nfor another place.\"\n\n\"That's it!\" Helene yelled, in reply. \"Because of that girl I'll have to\ngo!\"\n\nOn the 10th of June M. Bidard gave Helene definite notice. It was to\ntake effect on St John's Day. At his evening meal he was served with a\nroast and some green peas. These last he did not touch. In spite of his\nprohibition against her serving at table, it was Helene who brought the\npeas in. \"How's this?\" she said to him. \"You haven't eaten your green\npeas--and them so good!\" Saying this, she snatched up the dish and\ncarried it to the kitchen. Rosalie ate some of the peas. No sooner had\nshe taken a few spoonfuls, however, than she grew sick, and presently\nwas seized by vomiting. Helene took no supper. She said she was out of\nsorts and wanted none.\n\nThe witness did not hear of these facts until next day. He wanted to see\nthe remainder of the peas, but they could not be found. Rosalie still\nkept being sick, and he bade her go and see his doctor, M. Boudin.\nHelene, on a sudden amiable to Rosalie where she had been sulky, offered\nto go with her. Dr Boudin prescribed an emetic, which produced good\neffects.\n\nOn the 15th of June Rosalie seemed to have recovered. In the meantime\na cook presented herself at his house to be engaged in place of Helene.\nThe latter was acquainted with the new-comer. A vegetable soup had been\nprescribed for Rosalie, and this Helene prepared. The convalescent ate\nsome, and at once fell prey to violent sickness. That same day Helene\ncame in search of the witness. \"You're never going to dismiss me for\nthat young girl?\" she demanded angrily. M. Bidard relented. He said that\nif she would promise to keep the peace with Rosalie he would let her\nstay on. Helene seemed to be satisfied, and behaved better to Rosalie,\nwho began to mend again.\n\nM. Bidard went into the country on the 21st of June, taking Rosalie with\nhim. They returned on the 22nd. The witness himself went to the pharmacy\nto get a final purgative of Epsom salts, which had been ordered for\nRosalie by the doctor. This the witness himself divided into three\nportions, each of which he dissolved in separate glasses of whey\nprepared by Helene. The witness administered the first dose. Helene gave\nthe last. The invalid vomited it. She was extremely ill on the night of\nthe 22nd-23rd, and Helene returned to misgivings about the skill of the\ndoctors. She kept repeating, \"Ah! Rosalie will die! I tell you she will\ndie!\" On the day of the 23rd she openly railed against them. M. Boudin\nhad prescribed leeches and blisters. \"Look at that now, monsieur,\"\nHelene said to the witness. \"To-morrow's Rosalie's name-day, and they're\ngoing to put leeches on her!\" Rather disturbed, M. Bidard wrote to Dr\nPinault, who came next day and gave the treatment his approval.\n\nDr Boudin had said the invalid might have gooseberry syrup with seltzer\nwater. Two glasses of the mixture given to Rosalie by her mother seemed\nto do the girl good, but after the third glass she did not want any\nmore. Helene had given her this third glass. The invalid said to the\nwitness, \"I don't know what Helene has put into my drink, but it burns\nme like red-hot iron.\"\n\n\"Struck by those symptoms,\" added M. Bidard, \"I questioned Helene\nat once. It has not been given me more than twice in my life to see\nHelene's eyes. I saw at that moment the look she flung at Rosalie. It\nwas the look of a wild beast, a tiger-cat. At that moment my impulse was\nto go to my work-room for a cord, and to tie her up and drag her to the\njusticiary. But one reflection stopped me. What was this I was about to\ndo--disgrace a woman on a mere suspicion? I hesitated. I did not know\nwhether I had before me a poisoner or a woman of admirable devotion.\"\n\nThe witness enlarged on the tortures of mind he experienced during the\nnight, but said he found reason to congratulate himself on not having\ngiven way to his first impulse. On the morning of the 24th Helene came\nrunning to him, all happiness, to say that Rosalie was better.\n\nThree days later Rosalie seemed to be nearly well, so much so that M.\nBidard felt he might safely go into the country. Next day, however, he\nwas shocked by the news that Rosalie was as ill as ever. He hastened to\nreturn to Rennes.\n\nOn the night of the 28th-29th the sickness continued with intensity.\nEvery two hours the invalid was given calming medicine prescribed by Dr\nBoudin. Each time the sickness redoubled in violence. Believing it was\na case of worms, the witness got out of bed, and substituted for\nthe medicine a strong infusion of garlic. This stopped the sickness\ntemporarily. At six in the morning it began again.\n\nThe witness then ran to Dr Pinault's, but met the doctor in the street\nwith his confrere, Dr Guyot. To the two doctors M. Bidard expressed the\nopinion that there were either worms in the intestines or else the\ncase was one of poisoning. \"I have thought that,\" said Dr Pinault,\n\"remembering the case of the other girl.\" The doctors went back with\nM. Bidard to his house. Magnesia was administered in a strong dose. The\nvomiting stopped. But it was too late.\n\nUntil that day the witness's orders that the ejected matter from the\ninvalid should be conserved had been ignored. The moment a vessel was\ndirty Helene took it away and cleaned it. But now the witness took the\nvessels himself, and locked them up in a cupboard for which he alone had\nthe key. His action seemed to disturb Helene Jegado. From this he judged\nthat she had intended destroying the poison she had administered.\n\nFrom that time Rosalie was put into the care of her mother and a nurse.\nHelene tried hard to be rid of the two women, accusing them of tippling\nto the neglect of the invalid. \"I will sit up with her,\" she said to the\nwitness. The witness did not want her to do so, but he could not prevent\nher joining the mother.\n\nIn the meantime Rosalie suffered the most dreadful agonies. She\ncould neither sit up nor lie down, but threw herself about with great\nviolence. During this time Helene was constantly coming and going about\nher victim. She had not the courage, however, to watch her victim die.\nAt five in the morning she went out to market, leaving the mother alone\nwith her child. The poor mother, worn out with her exertions, also went\nout, to ask for help from friends. Rosalie died in the presence of\nthe witness at seven o'clock in the morning of the 1st of July. Helene\nreturned. \"It is all over,\" said the witness. Helene's first move was\nto look for the vessels containing the ejections of the invalid to throw\nthem out. These were green in hue. M. Bidard stopped her, and locked the\nvessels up. That same day justice was invoked.\n\nM. Bidard's deposition had held his hearers spellbound for over an hour\nand a half. He had believed, he added finally, that, in spite of her\ncriminal conduct, Helene at least was a faithful servant. He had been\nwrong. She had put his cellar to pillage, and in her chest they had\nfound many things belonging to him, besides a diamond belonging to his\ndaughter and her wedding-ring.\n\nThe President questioned Helene on the points of this important\ndeposition. Helene simply denied everything. It had not been she who\nwas jealous of Rosalie, but Rosalie who had been jealous of her. She\nhad given the two girls all the nursing she could, with no intention but\nthat of helping them to get better. To the observation of the President,\nonce again, that arsenic had been administered, and to his question,\nwhat person other than she had a motive for poisoning the girls, or had\nsuch opportunity for doing so, Helene answered defiantly, \"You won't\nredden my face by talking of arsenic. I defy anybody to say they saw me\ngive arsenic.\"\n\nThe Procureur-General invited M. Bidard to say what amount of\nintelligence he had found in Helene. M. Bidard declared that he had\nnever seen in any of his servants an intelligence so acute or subtle. He\nheld her to be a phenomenon in hypocrisy. He put forward a fact which he\nhad neglected to mention in his deposition. It might throw light on the\ncharacter of the accused. Francoise had a dress hanging up to dry in\nthe mansard. Helene went up to the garret above this, made a hole in the\nceiling, and dropped oil of vitriol on her companion's dress to burn it.\n\nDr Pinault gave an account of Rosalie's illness, and spoke of the\nsuspicions he and his colleagues had had of poisoning. It was a crime,\nhowever, for which there seemed to be no motive. The poisoner could\nhardly be M. Bidard, and as far as suspicion might touch the cook, she\nseemed to be lavish in her care of the patient. It was not until the\nvery last that he, with his colleagues, became convinced of poison.\n\nRosalie dead, the justiciary went to M. Bidard's. The cupboards were\nsearched carefully. The potion which Rosalie had thought to be mixed\nwith burning stuff was still there, just sampled. It was put into a\nbottle and capped.\n\nAn autopsy could not now be avoided. It was held next day. M. Pinault\ngave an account of the results. Most of the organs were in a normal\ncondition, and such slight alterations as could be seen in others would\nnot account for death. It was concluded that death had been occasioned\nby poison. The autopsy on the exhumed body of Perrotte Mace was\ninconclusive, owing to the condition of adipocere.\n\nDr Guyot spoke of the case of Francoise Huriaux, and was now sure she\nhad been given poison in small doses. Dr Boudin described the progress\nof Rosalie's illness. He was in no doubt, like his colleagues, that she\nhad been poisoned.\n\nThe depositions of various witnesses followed. A laundress said that\nHelene's conduct was to be explained by jealousy. She could not put up\nwith any supervision, but wanted full control ofthe household and ofthe\nmoney.\n\nFrancoise Huriaux said Helene was angry because M. Bidard would not have\nher as sole domestic. She had resented Francoise's being engaged. The\nwitness noticed that she became ill whenever she ate food prepared for\nher by Helene. When she did not eat Helene was angry but threw out the\nfood Francoise refused.\n\nSeveral witnesses testified to the conduct of Helene towards\nRosalie Sarrazin during her fatal illness. Helene was constant,\nself-sacrificing, in her attention to the invalid. One incident,\nhowever, was described by a witness which might indicate that Helene's\nsolicitude was not altogether genuine. One morning, towards the end of\nRosalie's life, the patient, in her agony, escaped from the hold of her\nmother, and fell into an awkward position against the wall. Rosalie's\nmother asked Helene to place a pillow for her. \"Ma foi!\" Helene replied.\n\"You're beginning to weary me. You're her mother! Help her yourself!\"\n\nThe testimony of a neighbour, one Francoise Louarne, a domestic servant,\nsupports the idea that Helene resented the presence of Rosalie in the\nhouse. Helene said to this witness, \"M. Bidard has gone into the country\nwith his housemaid. Everything SHE does is perfect. They leave me\nhere--to work if I want to, eat my bread dry: that's my reward. But\nthe housemaid will go before I do. Although M. Bidard has given me my\nnotice, he'll have to order me out before I'll go. Look!\" Helene added.\n\"Here's the bed of the ugly housemaid--in a room not too far from the\nmaster's. Me--they stick me up in the mansard!\" Later, when Rosalie was\nvery ill, Helene pretended to be grieved. \"You can't be so very sorry,\"\nthe witness remarked; \"you've said plenty that was bad about the girl.\"\n\nHelene vigorously denounced the testimony as all lies. The woman had\nnever been near Bidard's house.\n\nThe pharmacist responsible for dispensing the medicines given to Rosalie\nwas able to show that arsenic could not have got into them by mistake on\nhis part.\n\nAt the hearing of the trial on the 12th of December Dr Pinault was asked\nto tell what happened when the emissions of Rosalie Sarrazin were being\ntransferred for analysis.\n\n\nDR PINAULT. As we were carrying out the operation Helene came in, and it\nwas plain that she was put out of countenance.\n\nM. BIDARD [interposing]. We were in my daughter's room, where nobody\never came. When Helene came to the door I was surprised. There was no\nexplanation for her appearance except that she was inquisitive.\n\nDR PINAULT. She seemed to be disturbed at not finding the emissions by\nthe bed of the dead girl, and it was no doubt to find them that she came\nto the room.\n\nHELENE. I had been given a funnel to wash. I was bringing it back.\n\nM. BIDARD. Helene, with her usual cleverness, is making the most of\na fact. She had already appeared when she was given the funnel. Her\npresence disturbed me. And to get rid of her I said, \"Here, Helene, take\nthis away and wash it.\"\n\nThe accused persisted in denying M. Bidard's version of the incident.\n\n\n\nV\n\nM. Malagutti, professor of chemistry to the faculty of sciences in\nRennes, who, with M. Sarzeau, had been asked to make a chemical analysis\nof the reserved portions of the bodies of Rosalie, Perrotte Mace,\nand Rose Tessier, gave the results of his and his colleague's\ninvestigations. In the case of Rosalie they had also examined the\nvomitings. The final test on the portions of Rosalie's body carried out\nwith hydrochloronitric acid--as best for the small quantities likely to\nresult in poisoning by small doses--gave a residue which was submitted\nto the Marsh test. The tube showed a definite arsenic ring. Tests on the\nvomit gave the same result.\n\nThe poisoning of Perrotte Mace had also been accomplished by small\ndoses. Arsenic was found after the strictest tests, which obviated all\npossibility that the substance could have come from the ground in which\nthe body was interred.\n\nIn the case of Rose Tessier the tests yielded a huge amount of arsenic.\nRose had died after an illness of only four days. The large amount of\narsenic indicated a brutal and violent poisoning, in which the substance\ncould not be excreted in the usual way.\n\nThe President then addressed the accused on this evidence. She alone\nhad watched near all three of the victims, and against all three she had\nmotives of hate. Poisoning was established beyond all doubt. Who was the\npoisoner if not she, Helene Jegado?\n\nHelene: \"Frankly, I have nothing to reproach myself with. I gave them\nonly what came from the pharmacies on the orders of the doctors.\"\n\nAfter evidence of Helene's physical condition, by a doctor who had\nseen her in prison (she had a scirrhous tumour on her left breast), the\nspeech for the defence was made.\n\nM. Dorange was very eloquent, but he had a hopeless case. The defence\nhe put up was that Helene was irresponsible, but the major part of\nthe advocate's speech was taken up with a denouncement of capital\npunishment. It was a barbarous anachronism, a survival which disgraced\ncivilization.\n\nThe President summed up and addressed the jury:\n\n\"Cast a final scrutiny, gentlemen of the jury,\" he said, \"at the\nmatter brought out by these debates. Consult yourselves in the calm and\nstillness of your souls. If it is not proved to you that Helene Jegado\nis responsible for her actions you will acquit her. If you think that,\nwithout being devoid of free will and moral sense, she is not, according\nto the evidence, as well gifted as the average in humanity, you will\ngive her the benefit of extenuating circumstance.\n\n\"But if you consider her culpable, if you cannot see in her either\ndebility of spirit or an absence or feebleness of moral sense, you will\ndo your duty with firmness. You will remember that for justice to be\ndone chastisement will not alone suffice, but that punishment must be in\nproportion to the offence.\"\n\nThe President then read over his questions for the jury, and that body\nretired. After deliberations which occupied an hour and a half the jury\ncame back with a verdict of guilty on all points. The Procureur asked\nfor the penalty of death.\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Helene Jegado, have you anything to say upon the\napplication of the penalty?\n\nHELENE. No, Monsieur le President, I am innocent. I am resigned to\neverything. I would rather die innocent than live in guilt. You have\njudged me, but God will judge you all. He will see then ... Monsieur\nBidard. All those false witnesses who have come here to destroy me...\nthey will see....\n\nIn a voice charged with emotion the President pronounced the sentence\ncondemning Helene Jegado to death.\n\nAn appeal was put forward on her behalf, but was rejected.\n\nOn the scaffold, a few moments before she passed into eternity, having\nno witness but the recorder and the executioner, faithful to the habits\nof her life, Helene Jegado accused a woman not named in any of the\nprocesses of having urged her to her first crimes and of being her\naccomplice. The two officials took no notice of this indirect confession\nof her own guilt, and the sentence was carried out. The Procureur of\nRennes, hearing of this confession, took the trouble to search out the\nwoman named in it. She turned out to be a very old woman of such a\npious and kindly nature that the people about her talked of her as the\n\"saint.\"\n\nIt were superfluous to embark on analysis of the character of Helene\nJegado. Earlier on, in comparing her with Van der Linden and the\nZwanziger woman, I have lessened her caliginosity as compared with that\nof the Leyden poisoner, giving her credit for one less death than her\nDutch sister in crime. Having investigated Helene's activities rather\nmore closely, however, I find I have made mention of no less than\ntwenty-eight deaths attributed to Helene, which puts her one up on the\nDutchwoman. The only possible point at which I may have gone astray in\nmy calculations is in respect of the deaths at Guern. The accounts\nI have of Helene's bag there insist on seven, but enumerate only\nsix--namely, her sister Anna, the cure, his father and mother, and two\nmore (unnamed) after these. The accounts, nevertheless, insist more than\nonce that between 1833 and 1841 Helene put away twenty-three persons.\nIf she managed only six at Guern, that total should be twenty-two. From\n1849 she accounted for Albert Rabot, the infant Ozanne, Perrotte\nMace, Rose Tessier, and Rosalie Sarrazin--five. We need no chartered\naccountant to certify our figures if we make the total twenty-eight.\nGive her the benefit of the doubt in the case of Albert Rabot, who was\nill anyhow when Helene joined the household, and she still ties with Van\nder Linden with twenty-seven deaths.\n\nThere is much concerning Helene Jegado, recorded incidents, that I might\nhave introduced into my account of her activities, and that might have\nemphasized the outstanding feature of her dingy make-up--that is, her\nhypocrisy. When Rosalie Sarrazin was fighting for her life, bewailing\nthe fact that she was dying at the age of nineteen, Helene Jegado took a\ncrucifix and made the girl kiss it, saying to her, \"Here is the Saviour\nWho died for you! Commend your soul to Him!\" This, with the canting\npiety of the various answers which she gave in court (and which, let me\nsay, I have transcribed with some reluctance), puts Helene Jegado almost\non a level with the sanctimonious Dr Pritchard--perhaps quite on a level\nwith that nauseating villain.\n\nWith her twenty-three murders all done without motive, and the five\nothers done for spite--with her twenty-eight murders, only five of which\nwere calculated to bring advantage, and that of the smallest value--it\nis hard to avoid the conclusion that Helene Jegado was mad. In spite,\nhowever, of evidence called in her defence--as, for example, that of Dr\nPitois, of Rennes, who was Helene's own doctor, and who said that \"the\nwoman had a bizarre character, frequently complaining of stomach pains\nand formications in the head\"--in spite of this doctor's hints of\nmonomania in the accused, the jury, with every chance allowed them to\nfind her irresponsible, still saw nothing in her extenuation. And very\nproperly, since the law held the extreme penalty for such as she, Helene\nwent to the scaffold. Her judges might have taken the sentimental view\nthat she was abnormal, though not mad in the common acceptation of the\nword. Appalled by the secret menace to human life that she had been\nscared to think of the ease and the safety in which she had been allowed\nover twenty odd years to carry agonizing death to so many of her kind,\nand convinced from the inhuman nature of her practices that she was a\nlusus naturae, her judges, following sentimental Anglo-Saxon example,\nmight have given her asylum and let her live for years at public\nexpense. But possibly they saw no social or Civic advantage in\npreserving her, so anti-social as she was. They are a frugal nation, the\nFrench.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nHaving made you sup on horror a la Bretonne, or Continental fashion, I\nam now to give you a savoury from England. This lest you imagine that\nFrance, or the Continent, has a monopoly in wholesale poison. Let me\nintroduce you, as promised earlier, to Mary Ann Cotton aged forty-one,\nfound guilty of and sentenced to death for the murder of a child,\nCharles Edward Cotton, by giving him arsenic.\n\nRainton, in Durham, was the place where, in 1832 Mary Ann found mortal\nexistence. At the age of fifteen or sixteen she began to earn her own\nliving as a nursemaid, an occupation which may appear to have given\nher a distaste for infantile society. At the age of nineteen and at\nNewcastle she married William Mowbray, a collier, and went with him to\nlive in Cornwall. Here the couple remained for some years.\n\nIt was a fruitful marriage. Mary bore William five children in Cornwall,\nbut, unfortunately, four of the children died--suddenly. With the\nremaining child the pair moved to Mary's native county. They had hardly\nsettled down in their new home when the fifth child also died. It died,\ncuriously enough, of the ailment which had supposedly carried off the\nother four children--gastric fever.\n\nNot long after the death of this daughter the Mowbrays removed to\nHendon, Sunderland, and here a sixth child was born. It proved to be of\nas vulnerable a constitution as its brothers and sisters, for it lasted\nmerely a year. Four months later, while suffering from an injured\nfoot, which kept him at home, William Mowbray fell ill, and died with a\nsuddenness comparable to that which had characterized the deaths of his\nprogeny. His widow found a job at the local infirmary, and there she\nmet George Ward. She married Mr Ward, but not for long. In a few months\nafter the nuptials George Ward followed his predecessor, Mowbray, from\nan illness that in symptoms and speed of fatality closely resembled\nWilliam's.\n\nWe next hear of Mary as housekeeper to a widower named Robinson, whose\nwife she soon became. Robinson had five children by his former wife.\nThey all died in the year that followed his marriage with Mary Ann, and\nall of 'gastric fever.'\n\nThe second Mrs Robinson had two children by this third husband. Both of\nthese perished within a few weeks of their birth.\n\nMary Ann's mother fell ill, though not seriously. Mary Ann volunteered\nto nurse the old lady. It must now be evident that Mary Ann was a\n'carrier' of an obscure sort of intestinal fever, because soon after her\nappearance in her mother's place the old lady died of that complaint.\n\nOn her return to her own home, or soon after it, Mary was accused by\nher husband of robbing him. She thought it wise to disappear out of\nRobinson's life, a deprivation which probably served to prolong it.\n\nUnder her old name of Mowbray, and by means of testimonials which on\nlater investigation proved spurious, Mary Ann got herself a housekeeping\njob with a doctor in practice at Spennymore. Falling into error\nregarding what was the doctor's and what was her own, and her errors\nbeing too patent, she was dismissed.\n\nWallbottle is the scene of Mary Ann's next activities. Here she made the\nacquaintance of a married man with a sick wife. His name was Frederick\nCotton. Soon after he had met Mary Ann his wife died. She died of\nconsumption, with no more trace of gastric fever than is usual in her\ndisease. But two of Cotton's children died of intestinal inflammation\nnot long after their mother, and their aunt, Cotton's sister, who kept\nhouse for him, was not long in her turn to sicken and die in a like\nmanner.\n\nThe marriage which Mary Ann brought off with Frederick Cotton at\nNewcastle anticipated the birth of a son by a mere three months. With\ntwo of Cotton's children by his former marriage, and with the infant\nson, the pair went to live at West Auckland. Here Cotton died--and the\nthree children--and a lodger by the curious name of Natrass.\n\nAltogether Mary Ann, in the twenty years during which she had been\nmoving in Cornwall and about the northeastern counties, had, as it\nultimately transpired, done away with twenty-four persons. Nine of these\nwere the fruit of her own loins. One of them was the mother who gave\nher birth. Retribution fell upon her through her twenty-fourth victim,\nCharles Edward Cotton, her infant child. His death created suspicion.\nThe child, it was shown, was an obstacle to the marriage which she was\nalready contemplating--her fifth marriage, and, most likely, bigamous at\nthat. The doctor who had attended the child refused a death certificate.\nIn post-mortem examination arsenic was found in the child's body. Cotton\nwas arrested.\n\nShe was brought to trial in the early part of 1873 at Durham Assizes. As\nsaid already, she was found guilty and sentenced to death, the sentence\nbeing executed upon her in Durham Gaol in March of that year. Before\nshe died she made the following remarkable statement: \"I have been a\npoisoner, but not intentionally.\"\n\nIt is believed that she secured the poison from a vermicide in which\narsenic was mixed with soft soap. One finds it hard to believe that she\nextracted the arsenic from the preparation (as she must have done\nbefore administering it, or otherwise it must have been its own emetic)\nunintentionally.\n\nWhat advantage Mary Ann Cotton derived from her poisonings can have been\nbut small, almost as small as that gained by Helene Jegado. Was it for\nsocial advancement that she murdered husbands and children? Was she a\n'climber' in that sphere of society in which she moved? One hesitates to\nthink that passion swayed her in being rid of the infant obstacle to the\nfifth marriage of her contemplation. With her \"all o'er-teeming loins,\"\nthis woman, Hecuba in no other particular, must have been a very sow\nwere this her motive.\n\nBut I have come almost by accident on the word I need to compare Mary\nAnn Cotton with Jegado. The Bretonne, creeping about her native province\nleaving death in her track, with her piety, her hypocrisy, her enjoyment\nof her own cruelty, is sinister and repellent. But Mary Ann, moving from\nmate to mate and farrowing from each, then savaging both them and the\nlitter, has a musty sowishness that the Bretonne misses. Both foul, yes.\nBut we needn't, we islanders, do any Jingo business in setting Mary Ann\nagainst Helene.\n\n\n\n\nVII: -- THE MERRY WIDOWS\n\nTwenty years separate the cases of these two women, the length of France\nlies between the scenes in which they are placed: Mme Boursier, Paris,\n1823; Mme Lacoste, Riguepeu, a small town in Gascony, 1844. I tie their\ncases together for reasons which cannot be apparent until both their\nstories are told--and which may not be so apparent even then. That is\nnot to say I claim those reasons to be profound, recondite, or settled\nin the deeps of psychology. The matter is, I would not have you believe\nthat I join their cases because of similarities that are superficial.\nMy hope is that you will find, as I do, a linking which, while neither\nprofound nor superficial, is curious at least. As I cannot see that\nthe one case transcends the other in drama or interest, I take them\nchronologically, and begin with the Veuve Boursier:\n\nAt the corner of Rue de la Paix and Rue Neuve Saint-Augustine in 1823\nthere stood a boutique d'epiceries. It was a flourishing establishment,\ntypical of the Paris of that time, and its proprietors were people\nof decent standing among their neighbours. More than the prosperous\ncondition of their business, which was said to yield a profit of over\n11,000 francs per annum, it was the happy and cheerful relationship\nexisting between les epoux Boursier that made them of such good\nconsideration in the district. The pair had been married for thirteen\nyears, and their union had been blessed by five children.\n\nBoursier, a middle-aged man of average height, but very stout of build\nand asthmatically short of neck, was recognized as a keen trader. He did\nmost of his trading away from the house in the Rue de la Paix, and paid\nfrequent visits, sometimes entire months in duration, to Le Havre and\nBordeaux. It is nowhere suggested that those visits were made on any\noccasion other than that of business. M. Boursier spent his days away\nfrom the house, and his evenings with friends.\n\nIt does not anywhere appear that Mme Boursier objected to her husband's\nabsenteeism. She was a capable woman, rather younger than her husband,\nand of somewhat better birth and education. She seems to have been\ncontent with, if she did not exclusively enjoy, having full charge of\nthe business in the shop. Dark, white of tooth, not particularly pretty,\nthis woman of thirty-six was, for her size, almost as stout as her\nhusband. It is said that her manner was a trifle imperious, but that\nno doubt resulted from knowledge of her own capability, proved by\nthe successful way in which she handled her business and family\nresponsibilities.\n\nThe household, apart from Mme and M. Boursier, and counting those\nemployed in the epicerie, consisted of the five children, Mme Boursier's\naunt (the Veuve Flamand), two porters (Delonges and Beranger), Mlle\nReine (the clerk), Halbout (the book-keeper), and the cook (Josephine\nBlin).\n\nOn the morning of the 28th of June, which would be a Sunday, Boursier\nwas called by the cook to take his usual dejeuner, consisting of chicken\nbroth with rice. He did not like the taste of it, but ate it. Within a\nlittle time he was violently sick, and became so ill that he had to go\nto bed. The doctor, who was called almost immediately, saw no cause for\nalarm, but prescribed mild remedies. As the day went on, however, the\nsickness increased in violence. Dr Bordot became anxious when he saw the\npatient again in the evening. He applied leeches and mustard poultices.\nThose ministrations failing to alleviate the sufferings ofthe invalid,\nDr Bordot brought a colleague into consultation, but neither the\nnew-comer, Dr Partra, nor himself could be positive in diagnosis.\nSomething gastric, it was evident. They did what they could, though\nworking, as it were, in the dark.\n\nThe patient was no better next day. As night came on he was worse than\never. A medical student named Toupie was enlisted as nurse and watcher,\nand sat with the sufferer through the night--but to no purpose. At four\no'clock in the morning of the Tuesday, the 30th, there came a crisis in\nthe illness of Boursier, and he died.\n\nThe grief exhibited by Mme Boursier, so suddenly widowed, was just\nwhat might have been expected in the circumstances from a woman of her\nstation. She had lost a good-humoured companion, the father of her\nfive children, and the man whose genius in trading had done so much to\nsupport her own activities for their mutual profit. The Veuve Boursier\ngrieved in adequate fashion for the loss of her husband, but, being\na capable woman and responsible for the direction of affairs, did not\nallow her grief to overwhelm her. The dead epicier was buried without\nmuch delay--the weather was hot, and he had been of gross habit--and the\nbusiness at the corner of Rue de la Paix went on as near to usual as the\nloss of the 'outside' partner would allow.\n\nRumour, meantime, had got to work. There were circumstances about the\nsudden death of Boursier which the busybodies of the environs felt\nthey might regard as suspicious. For some time before the death of the\nepicier there had been hanging about the establishment a Greek called\nKostolo. He was a manservant out of employ, and not, even on the\nsurface, quite the sort of fellow that a respectable couple like the\nBoursiers might be expected to accept as a family friend. But such, no\nless, had been the Greek's position with the household. So much so that,\nalthough Kostolo had no money and apparently no prospects, Boursier\nhimself had asked him to be godfather to a niece. The epicier found the\nGreek amusing, and, on falling so suddenly ill, made no objection when\nKostolo took it on himself to act as nurse, and to help in the preparing\nof drinks and medicines that were prescribed.\n\nIt is perhaps to the rather loud-mouthed habits of this Kostolo that the\nbirth of suspicion among the neighbours may be attributed. On the death\nof Boursier he had remarked that the nails of the corpse were blue a\ncolour, he said, which was almost a certain indication of poisoning.\nNow, the two doctors who had attended Boursier, having failed to account\nfor his illness, were inclined to suspect poisoning as the cause of\nhis death. For this reason they had suggested an autopsy, a suggestion\nrejected by the widow. Her rejection of the idea aroused no immediate\nsuspicion of her in the minds of the doctors.\n\nKostolo, in addition to repeating outside the house his opinion\nregarding the blueness of the dead Boursier's nails, began, several\ndays after the funeral, to brag to neighbours and friends of the warm\nrelationship existing between himself and the widow. He dropped hints of\na projected marriage. Upon this the neighbours took to remembering how\nquickly Kostolo's friendship with the Boursier family had sprung up, and\nhow frequently he had visited the establishment. His nursing activities\nwere remembered also. And it was noticed that his visits to the Boursier\nhouse still went on; it was whispered that he visited the Veuve Boursier\nin her bedroom.\n\nThe circumstances in which Boursier had fallen ill were well known.\nNobody, least of all Mme Boursier or Kostolo, had taken any trouble to\nconceal them. Anybody who liked to ask either Mme Boursier or the\nGreek about the soup could have a detailed story at once. All the\nneighbourhood knew it. And since the Veuve Boursier's story is\nsubstantially the same as other versions it may as well be dealt with\nhere and now.\n\nM. Boursier, said his widow, tasted his soup that Sunday morning. \"What\na taste!\" he said to the cook, Josephine. \"This rice is poisoned.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur,\" Josephine protested, \"that's amazing! The potage ought\nto be better than usual this morning, because I made a liaison for it\nwith three egg-yolks!\"\n\nM. Boursier called his wife, and told her he couldn't eat his potage au\nriz. It was poisoned. Mme Boursier took a spoonful of it herself, she\nsaid, and saw nothing the matter with it. Whereupon her husband, saying\nthat if it was all right he ought to eat it, took several spoonfuls\nmore.\n\n\"The poor man,\" said his widow, \"always had a bad taste in his mouth,\nand he could not face his soup.\" Then, she explained, he became very\nsick, and brought up what little of the soup he had taken, together with\nflots de bile.\n\nAll this chatter of poison, particularly by Kostolo and the widow,\ntogether with the persistent rumours of an adulterous association\nbetween the pair, gave colour to suspicions of a criminal complicity,\nand these in process of time came to the ears of the officers of\njustice. The two doctors were summoned by the Procureur-General, who\nquestioned them closely regarding Boursier's illness. To the mind of\nthe official everything pointed to suspicion of the widow. Word of the\ngrowing suspicion against her reached Mme Boursier, and she now hastened\nto ask the magistrates for an exhumation and a post-mortem examination.\nThis did not avert proceedings by the Procureur. It was already known\nthat she had refused the autopsy suggested by the two doctors, and it\nwas stated that she had hurried on the burial.\n\nKostolo and the Widow Boursier were called before the Juge\nd'instruction.\n\n\n\nII\n\nThere is about the Greek Kostolo so much gaudy impudence and barefaced\nroguery that, in spite of the fact that the main concern of these pages\nis with women, I am constrained to add his portrait to the sketches I\nhave made in illustration. He is of the gallery in which are Jingle and\nMontague Tigg, with this difference--that he is rather more sordid than\neither.\n\nBrought before the Procureur du Roi, he impudently confessed that he had\nbeen, and still was, Mme Boursier's lover. He told the judge that in\nthe lifetime of her husband Mme Boursier had visited him in his rooms\nseveral times, and that she had given him money unknown to her husband.\n\nMme Boursier at first denied the adulterous intimacy with Kostolo, but\nthe evidence in the hands of the Procureur was too much for her. She had\npartially to confess the truth of Kostolo's statement in this regard.\nShe emphatically denied, however, that she had ever even thought of, let\nalone agreed to, marriage with the Greek. She swore that she had been\nintimate with Kostolo only once, and that, as far as giving him money\nwas concerned, she had advanced him but one small sum on his IOU.\n\nThese confessions, together with the information which had come to\nhim from other investigations, served to increase the feeling of\nthe Procureur that Boursier's death called for probing. He issued an\nexhumation order, and on the 31st of July an autopsy on the body of\nBoursier was carried out by MM. Orfila and Gardy, doctors and professors\nof the Paris faculty of medicine. Their finding was that no trace\nexisted of any disorders to which the death of Boursier might be\nattributed--such, for example, as cerebral congestion, rupture of the\nheart or of a larger vessel--but that, on the other hand, they had come\nupon a sufficiency of arsenic in the intestines to have caused death.\n\nOn the 2nd of August the same two professors, aided by a third, M.\nBarruel, carried out a further examination of the body. Their testimony\nis highly technical. It is also rather revolting. I am conscious\nthat, dealing, as I have had to, with so much arsenical poisoning\n(the favourite weapon of the woman murderer), a gastric odour has been\nunavoidable in many of my pages--perhaps too many. For that reason\nI shall refrain from quoting either in the original French or in\ntranslation more than a small part of the professors' report. I shall,\nhowever, make a lay shot on the evidence it supplies. Boursier's\ninterior generally was in foul condition, which is not to be explained\nby any ingestion of arsenic, but which suggests chronic and morbid\npituitousness. The marvel is that the man's digestion functioned at all.\nThis insanitary condition, however, was taken by the professors, as\nit were, in their stride. They concentrated on some slight traces of\nintestinal inflammation.\n\n\"One observed,\" their report went on, about the end of the ileum some\ngrains of a whitish appearance and rather stubbornly attached. These\ngrains, being removed, showed all the characteristics of white arsenic\noxide. Put upon glowing charcoal they volatilized, giving off white\nsmoke and a garlic odour. Treated with water, they dissolved, and the\nsolution, when brought into contact with liquid hydrosulphuric acid,\nprecipitated yellow sulphur of arsenic, particularly when one heated it\nand added a few drops of hydrochloric acid.\n\nThese facts (including, I suppose, the conditions I have hinted\nat) allowed them to conclude (a) that the stomach showed traces of\ninflammation, and (b) that the intestinal canal yielded a quantity of\narsenic oxide sufficient to have produced that inflammation and to have\ncaused death.\n\nThe question now was forward as to where the arsenic found in the body\nhad come from. Inquiry established the fact that on the 15th of May,\n1823--that is to say, several weeks before his death--Boursier had\nbought half a pound of arsenic for the purpose of destroying the rats in\nhis shop cellars. In addition, he had bought prepared rat-poison. Only a\npart of those substances had been used. The remaining portions could not\nbe found about the shop, nor could Mme Boursier make any suggestions for\nhelping the search. She declared she had never seen any arsenic about\nthe house at all.\n\nThere was, however, sufficient gravity in the evidences on hand to\njustify a definite indictment of Mme Boursier and Nicolas Kostolo, the\nfirst of having poisoned her husband, and the second of being accessory\nto the deed.\n\nThe pair were brought to trial on the 27th of November, 1823, before the\nSeine Assize Court, M. Hardouin presiding. The prosecution was conducted\nby the Avocat-General, M. de Broe. Maitre Couture defended Mme Boursier.\nMaitre Theo. Perrin appeared for Kostolo.\n\nThe case created great excitement, not only in Paris, but throughout the\ncountry. Another poisoning case had not long before this occupied the\nminds of the public very greatly--that of the hypocritical Castaing for\nthe murder of Auguste Ballet. Indeed, there had been a lot of poisoning\ngoing on in French society about this period. Political and religious\ncontroversy, moreover, was rife. The populace were in a mood either to\npraise extravagantly or just as extravagantly to condemn. It happened\nthat rumour convinced them of the guilt of the Veuve Boursier and\nKostolo, and the couple were condemned in advance. Such was the popular\nspite against Mme Boursier and Kostolo that, it is said, Maitre Couture\nat first refused the brief for the widow's defence. He had already made\na success of his defence of a Mme Lavaillaut, accused of poisoning, and\nwas much in demand in cases where women sought judicial separation from\ntheir husbands. People were calling him \"Providence for women.\" He did\nnot want to be nicknamed \"Providence for poisoners.\" But Mme Boursier's\ncase being more clearly presented to him he took up the brief.\n\nThe accused were brought into court.\n\nKostolo was about thirty years of age. He was tall, distinctly\ngood-looking in an exotic sort of way, with his dark hair, complexion,\nand flashing eyes. He carried himself grandly, and was elegantly clad\nin a frac noir. Not quite, as Army men were supposed once to say, \"the\nclean potato,\" it was easy enough to see that women of a kind would\nbe his ready victims. It was plain, in the court, that Master Nicolas\nthought himself the hero of the occasion.\n\nThere was none of this flamboyance about the Widow Boursier. She was\ndressed in complete mourning, and covered her face with a handkerchief.\nIt was manifest that, in the phrase of the crime reporters, \"she felt\nher position keenly.\" The usual questions as to her name and condition\nshe answered almost inaudibly, her voice choked with sobs.\n\nKostolo, on the contrary, replied in organ tones. He said that he was\nborn in Constantinople, and that he had no estate.\n\nThe acte d'accusation was read. It set forth the facts of the adulterous\nassociation of the two accused, of the money lent by Mme Boursier\nto Kostolo, of their meetings, and all the suspicious circumstances\nprevious to the death of the epicier.\n\nThe cook-girl, Josephine Blin, had prepared the potage au riz in the\nkitchen, using the small iron pan that it was her wont to employ. Having\nmade the soup, she conveyed it in its terrine to a small secretaire in\nthe dining-room. This secretaire stood within the stretch of an arm from\nthe door of the comptoir in which Mme Boursier usually worked. According\nto custom, Josephine had divided the potage in two portions--one for\nBoursier and the other for the youngest child. The youngster and she had\neaten the second portion between them, and neither had experienced any\nill-effects.\n\nJosephine told her master that the soup was ready. He came at her call,\nbut did not eat the soup at once, being otherwise occupied. The soup\nstood on the secretaire for about fifteen minutes before Boursier\nstarted to eat it.\n\nAccording to the accused, the accusation went on, after Boursier's death\nthe two doctors asked that they might be allowed to perform an autopsy,\nsince they were at a loss to explain the sudden illness. This Mme\nBoursier refused, in spite of the insistence of the doctors. She\nrefused, she said, in the interest of her children. She insisted,\nindeed, on a quick burial, maintaining that, as her husband had been\ntres replet, the body would rapidly putrefy, owing to the prevailing\nheat, and that thus harm would be done to the delicate contents of the\nepicerie.\n\nLed by rumours of the bluish stains--almost certain indications of\na violent death--the authorities, said the accusation, ordered an\nexhumation and autopsy. Arsenic was found in the body. It was clear that\nBoursier, ignorant, as he was, of his wife's bad conduct, had not killed\nhimself. This was a point that the widow had vainly attempted, during\nthe process of instruction, to maintain. She declared that one Clap,\na friend of her late husband, had come to her one day to say that a\ncertain Charles, a manservant, had remarked to him, \"Boursier poisoned\nhimself because he was tired of living.\" Called before the Juge\nd'instruction, Henri Clap and Charles had concurred in denying this.\n\nThe accusation maintained that the whole attitude of Mme Boursier proved\nher a poisoner. As soon as her husband became sick she had taken the\ndish containing the remains of the rice soup, emptied it into a dirty\nvessel, and passed water through the dish. Then she had ordered Blin to\nclean it, which the latter did, scrubbing it out with sand and ashes.\n\nQuestioned about arsenic in the house, Mme Boursier said, to begin with,\nthat Boursier had never spoken to her about arsenic, but later admitted\nthat her husband had mentioned both arsenic and mort aux rats to her.\n\nAsked regarding the people who frequented the house she had mentioned\nall the friends of Boursier, but neglected to speak of Kostolo. Later\nshe had said she never had been intimate with the Greek. But Kostolo,\n\"barefaced enough for anything,\" had openly declared the nature of his\nrelations with her. Then Mme Boursier, after maintaining that she\nhad been no more than interested in Kostolo, finding pleasure in his\ncompany, had been constrained to confess that she had misconducted\nherself with the Greek in the dead man's room. She had given Kostolo the\nrun of her purse, the accusation declared, though she denied the fact,\ninsisting that what she had given him had been against his note. There\nwas only one conclusion, however. Mme Boursier, knowing the poverty of\nher paramour, had paid him as her cicisbeo, squandering upon him her\nchildren's patrimony.\n\nThe accusation then dealt with the supposed project of marriage, and\ndeclared that in it there was sufficient motive for the crime. Kostolo\nwas Mme Boursier's accomplice beyond any doubt. He had acted as nurse to\nthe invalid, administering drinks and medicines to him. He had had full\nopportunity for poisoning the grocer. Penniless, out of work, it would\nbe a good thing for him if Boursier was eliminated. He had been blatant\nin his visits to Mme Boursier after the death of the husband.\n\nThen followed the first questioning of the accused.\n\nMme Boursier said she had kept tryst with Kostolo in the Champs-Elysees.\nShe admitted having been to his lodgings once. On the mention of the\nname of Mlle Riene, a mistress of Kostolo's, she said that the woman\nwas partly in their confidence. She had gone with Mlle Riene twice to\nKostolo's rooms. Once, she admitted, she had paid a visit to Versailles\nwith Kostolo unknown to her husband.\n\nAsked if her husband had had any enemies, Mme Boursier said she knew of\nnone.\n\nThe questioning of Kostolo drew from him the admission that he had had\na number of mistresses all at one time. He made no bones about his\nrelations with them, nor about his relations with Mme Boursier. He was\nquite blatant about it, and seemed to enjoy the show he was putting up.\nHaving airily answered a question in a way that left him without any\nreputation, he would sweep the court with his eyes, preening himself\nlike a peacock.\n\nHe was asked about a journey Boursier had proposed making. At what time\nhad Boursier intended making the trip?\n\n\"Before his death,\" Kostolo replied.\n\nThe answer was unintentionally funny, but the Greek took credit for the\namusement it created in court. He conceived himself a humorist, and the\nfact coloured all his subsequent answers.\n\nKostolo said that he had called to see Boursier on the first day of his\nillness at three in the afternoon. He himself had insisted on helping to\nnurse the invalid. Mme Boursier had brought water, and he had given it\nto the sick man.\n\nAfter Boursier's death he had remarked on the blueness of the\nfingernails. It was a condition he had seen before in his own country,\non the body of a prince who had died of poison, and the symptoms of\nwhose illness had been very like those in Boursier's. He had then\nsuspected that Boursier had died of poisoning.\n\nThe loud murmurs that arose in court upon his blunt confession of having\nmisconducted himself with Mme Boursier fifteen days after her husband's\ndeath seemed to evoke nothing but surprise in Kostolo. He was then asked\nif he had proposed marriage to Mme Boursier after Boursier's death.\n\n\"What!\" he exclaimed, with a grin. \"Ask a woman with five children to\nmarry me--a woman I don't love?\"\n\nUpon this answer Kostolo was taken to task by the President of the\ncourt. M. Hardouin pointed out that Kostolo lived with a woman who kept\nand fed him, giving him money, but that at the same time he was taking\nmoney from Mme Boursier as her lover, protesting the while that he loved\nher. What could the Greek say in justification of such conduct?\n\n\"Excuse me, please, everybody,\" Kostolo replied, unabashed. \"I don't\nknow quite how to express myself, but surely what I have done is quite\nthe common thing? I had no means of living but from what Mme Boursier\ngave me.\"\n\nThe murmurs evoked by the reply Kostolo treated with lofty disdain. He\nseemed to find his audience somewhat prudish.\n\nTo further questioning he answered that he had never proposed marriage\nto the Veuve Boursier. Possibly something might have been said in fun.\nHe knew, of course, that the late Boursier had made a lot of money.\n\nThe cook, Josephine Blin, was called. At one time she had been suspect.\nHer version of the potage incidents, though generally in agreement with\nthat of the accused widow, differed from it in two essential points.\nWhen she took Boursier's soup into the dining-room, she said, Mme\nBoursier was in the comptoir, three or four paces away from the desk on\nwhich she put the terrine. This Mme Boursier denied. She said she had\nbeen in the same comptoir as her husband. Josephine declared that Mme\nBoursier had ordered her to clean the soup-dish out with sand, but her\nmistress maintained she had bade the girl do no more than clean it.\nFor the rest, Josephine thought about fifteen minutes elapsed before\nBoursier came to take the soup. During that time she had seen Mme\nBoursier writing and making up accounts.\n\nToupie, the medical student, said he had nursed Boursier during the\nprevious year. Boursier was then suffering much in the same way as\nhe had appeared to suffer during his fatal illness. He had heard Mme\nBoursier consulting with friends about an autopsy, and her refusal had\nbeen on their advice.\n\nThe doctors called were far from agreeing on the value of the\nexperiments they had made. Orfila, afterwards to intervene in the much\nmore universally notorious case of Mme Lafarge, stuck to his opinion of\ndeath by arsenic. If his evidence in the Lafarge case is read it will\nbe seen that in the twenty years that had passed from the Boursier trial\nhis notions regarding the proper routine of analysis for arsenic in a\nsupposedly poisoned body had undergone quite a change. But by then the\nMarsh technique had been evolved. Here, however, he based his opinion on\nexperiments properly described as \"very equivocal;\" and stuck to it. He\nwas supported by a colleague named Lesieur.\n\nM. Gardy said he had observed that the greater part of the grains about\nthe ileum, noted on the 1st of August, had disappeared next day. The\nanalysis had been made with quantities too small. He now doubted greatly\nif the substance taken to be arsenic oxide would account for death.\n\nM. Barruel declared that from the glareous matter removed from the body\nonly a grain of the supposed arsenic had been extracted, and that with\ndifficulty. He had put the substance on glowing charcoal, but, in his\nopinion, the experiment was VERY EQUIVOCAL. It was at first believed\nthat there was a big amount of arsenic, but he felt impelled to say that\nthe substance noted was nothing other than small clusters of fat. The\nwitness now refused to conclude, as he had concluded on the 1st of\nAugust, that enough poison had been in the body to cause death.\n\nIt would almost seem that the medical evidence should have been enough\nto destroy the case for the prosecution, but other witnesses were\ncalled.\n\nBailli, at one time a clerk to Boursier, said he had helped his patron\nto distribute arsenic and rat-poison in the shop cellars. He was well\naware that the whole of the poison had not been used, but in the course\nof his interrogation he had failed to remember where the residue of\nthe poisons had been put. He now recollected. The unused portion of the\narsenic had been put in a niche of a bottle-rack.\n\nIn view of evidence given by a subsequent witness Bailli's rather sudden\nrecovery of memory might have been thought odd if a friend of his\nhad not been able to corroborate his statement. The friend was one\nRousselot, another grocer. He testified that he and Bailli had searched\ntogether. Bailli had then cudgelled that dull ass, his brain, to some\neffect, for they had ultimately come upon the residue of the arsenic\nbought by Boursier lying with the remainder of the mort aux rats. Both\nthe poisons had been placed at the bottom of a bottle-rack, and a plank\nhad been nailed over them.\n\nRousselot, asked why he had not mentioned this fact before, answered\nstupidly, \"I thought you knew it!\"\n\nThe subsequent witness above referred to was an employee in the\nMinistere du Roi, a man named Donzelle. In a stammering and rather\nconfused fashion he attempted to explain that the vacillations of the\nwitness Bailli had aroused his suspicions. He said that Bailli, who at\nfirst had been vociferous in his condemnation of the Widow Boursier, had\nlater been rather more vociferous in her defence. The witness (Donzelle)\nhad it from a third party that Mme Boursier's sister-in-law had\ncorrupted other witnesses with gifts of money. Bailli, for example,\ncould have been seen carrying bags of ecus under his arm, coming out of\nthe house of the advocate briefed to defend Mme Boursier.\n\nBailli, recalled, offered to prove that if he had been to Maitre\nCouture's house he had come out of it in the same fashion as he had gone\nin--that was, with a bag of bay salt under each arm.\n\nMaitre Couture, highly indignant, rose to protest against the\ninsinuation of the witness Donzelle, but the President of the court\nand the Avocat-General hastened to say that the eminent and honourable\nadvocate was at no need to justify himself. The President sternly\nreprimanded Donzelle and sent him back to his seat.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nThe Avocat-General, M. de Broe, stated the case for the prosecution. He\nmade, as probably was his duty, as much as he could of the arsenic said\nto have been found in the body (that precipitated as yellow sulphur of\narsenic), and of the adultery of Mme Boursier with Kostolo. He dwelt on\nthe cleaning of the soup-dish, and pointed out that while the soup stood\non the desk Mme Boursier had been here and there near it, never out of\narm's reach. In regard to Kostolo, the Greek was a low scallywag, but\nnot culpable.\n\nThe prosecution, you observe, rested on the poison's being administered\nin the soup.\n\nIn his speech for the defence the eloquent Maitre Couture began by\ncondemning the gossip and the popular rumour on which the case had\nbeen begun. He denounced the action of the magistrates in instituting\nproceedings as deplorably unconsidered and hasty.\n\nMme Boursier, he pointed out, had everything to lose through the loss of\nher husband. Why should she murder a fine merchant like Boursier for a\ndoubtful quantity like Kostolo? He spoke of the happy relationship that\nhad existed between husband and wife, and, in proof of their kindness\nfor each other, told of a comedy interlude which had taken place on the\nSunday morning.\n\nBoursier, he said, had to get up before his wife that morning, rising at\nsix o'clock. His rising did not wake his wife, and, perhaps humorously\nresenting her lazy torpor, he found a piece of charcoal and decorated\nher countenance with a black moustache. It was true that Mme Boursier\nshowed some petulance over her husband's prank when she got down\nat eight o'clock, but her ill-humour did not last long. Her husband\ncaressed and petted her, and before long the wife joined her\nmerry-minded husband in laughing over the joke against her. That, said\nMaitre Couture, that mutual laughter and kindness, seemed a strange\npreliminary to the supposed poisoning episode of two hours or so later.\n\nThe truth of the matter was that Boursier carried the germ of death in\nhis own body. What enemy had he made? What vengeance had he incurred?\nMaitre Couture reminded the jury of Boursier's poor physical condition,\nof his stoutness, of the shortness of his neck. He brought forward\nToupie's evidence of Boursier's illness of the previous year, alike in\nsymptoms and in the sufferings of the invalid to that which proved fatal\non Tuesday the 30th of June. Then Maitre Couture proceeded to tear the\nmedical evidence to pieces, and returned to the point that Mme Boursier\nhad been sleeping so profoundly, so serenely, on the morning of her\nsupposed contemplated murder that the prank played on her by her\nintended victim had not disturbed her.\n\nThe President's address then followed. The jury retired, and returned\nwith a verdict of \"Not guilty.\"\n\nOn this M. Hardouin discharged the accused, improving the occasion with\na homily which, considering the ordeal that Mme Boursier had had to\nendure through so many months, and that might have been considered\npunishment enough, may be quoted merely as a fine specimen of salting\nthe wound:\n\n\"Veuve Boursier,\" said he, \"you are about to recover that liberty which\nsuspicions of the gravest nature have caused you to lose. The jury\ndeclares you not guilty of the crime imputed to you. It is to be\nhoped that you will find a like absolution in the court of your own\nconscience. But do not ever forget that the cause of your unhappiness\nand of the dishonour which, it may be, covers your name was the disorder\nof your ways and the violation of the most sacred obligations. It is to\nbe hoped that your conduct to come may efface the shame of your conduct\nin the past, and that repentance may restore the honour you have lost.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\nNow we come, as the gentleman with the crimson handkerchief coyly\nshowing between dress waistcoat and shirt might have said, waving\nhis pointer as the canvas of the diorama rumbled on its rollers, to\nRiguepeu!\n\nSome twenty years have elapsed since the Veuve Boursier stumbled from\nthe stand of the accused in the Assize Court of the Seine, acquitted of\nthe poisoning of her grocer husband, but convicted of a moral flaw which\nmay (or may not) have rather diminished thereafter the turnover of the\nepicerie in the Rue de la Paix. One hopes that her punishment finished\nwith her acquittal, and that the mood of the mob, as apt as a flying\nstraw to veer for a zephyr as for a whirlwind, swung to her favour from\nmere revulsion on her escape from the scaffold. The one thing is as\nlikely as the other. Didn't the heavy man of the fit-up show, eighteen\nmonths after his conviction for rape (the lapse of time being occupied\nin paying the penalty), return as an actor to the scene of his\ndelinquency to find himself, not, as he expected, pelted with dead cats\nand decaying vegetables, but cheered to the echo? So may it have been\nwith the Veuve Boursier.\n\nThough in 1844, the year in which the poison trial at Auch was opened,\nfour years had passed since the conviction of Mme Lafarge at Tulle,\ncontroversy on the latter case still was rife throughout France. The two\ncases were linked, not only in the minds of the lay public, but\nthrough close analogy in the idea of lawyers and experts in medical\njurisprudence. From her prison cell Marie Lafarge watched the progress\nof the trial in Gascony. And when its result was published one may be\nsure she shed a tear or two.\n\nBut to Riguepeu...\n\nYou will not find it on anything but the biggest-scale maps. It is\nan inconsiderable town a few miles from Vic-Fezensac, a town not much\nbigger than itself and some twenty kilometres from Auch, which is the\ncapital of the department of Gers. You may take it that Riguepeu lies in\nthe heart of the Armagnac district.\n\nSome little distance from Riguepeu itself, on the top of a rise, stood\nthe Chateau Philibert, a one-floored house with red tiles and green\nshutters. Not much of a chateau, it was also called locally La Maison de\nMadame. It belonged in 1843 to Henri Lacoste, together with considerable\nland about it. It was reckoned that Lacoste, with the land and other\nbelongings, was worth anything between 600,000 and 700,000 francs.\n\nHenri had become rich late in life. The house and the domain had been\nleft him by his brother Philibert, and another brother's death had also\nbeen of some benefit to him. Becoming rich, Henri Lacoste thought it\nhis duty to marry, and in 1839, though already sixty-six years of age,\npicked on a girl young enough to have been his granddaughter.\n\nEuphemie Verges was, in fact, his grand-niece. She lived with her\nparents at Mazeyrolles, a small village in the foothills of the\nPyrenees. Compared with Lacoste, the Verges were said to be poor.\nLacoste took it on himself to look after the girl's education, having\nher sent at his charges to a convent at Tarbes. In 1841, on the 2nd of\nMay, the marriage took place.\n\nIf this marriage of youth with crabbed age resulted in any unhappiness\nthe neighbours saw little of it. Though it was rumoured that for her\nold and rich husband Euphemie had given up a young man of her fancy in\nTarbes, her conduct during the two years she lived with Lacoste seemed\nto be irreproachable. Lacoste was rather a nasty old fellow from all\naccounts. He was niggardly, coarse, and a womanizer. Euphemie's position\nin the house was little better than that of head domestic servant, but\nin this her lot was the common one for wives of her station in this part\nof France. She appeared to be contented enough with it.\n\nAbout two years after the marriage, on the 16th of May, 1843, to be\nexact, after a trip with his wife to the fair at Riguepeu, old Lacoste\nwas taken suddenly ill, ultimately becoming violently sick. Eight days\nlater he died.\n\nBy a will which Henri had made two months after his marriage his wife\nwas his sole beneficiary, and this will was no sooner proved than the\nwidow betook herself to Tarbes, where she speedily began to make full\nuse of her fortune. Milliners and dressmakers were called into service,\nand the widow blossomed forth as a lady of fashion. She next set up her\nown carriage. If these proceedings had not been enough to excite envy\namong her female neighbours the frequent visits paid to her in her\ngenteel apartments by a young man did the trick. The young man came on\nthe scene less than two months after the death of the old man. It was\nsaid that his visits to the widow were prolonged until midnight. Scandal\nresulted, and out of the scandal rumour regarding the death of Henri\nLacoste. It began to be said that the old man had died of poison.\n\nIt was in December, six months after the death of Lacoste, that the\nrumours came to the ears of the magistrates. Nor was there lack of\nanonymous letters. It was the Widow Lacoste herself, however, who\ndemanded an exhumation and autopsy on the body of her late husband--this\nas a preliminary to suing her traducers. Note, in passing, how her\naction matches that of Veuve Boursier.\n\nOn the orders of the Juge d'instruction an autopsy was begun on the 18th\nof December. The body of Lacoste was exhumed, the internal organs\nwere extracted, and these, with portions of the muscular tissue, were\nsubmitted to analysis by a doctor of Auch, M. Bouton, and two chemists\nof the same city, MM. Lidange and Pons, who at the same time examined\nsamples of the soil in which the body had been interred. The finding was\nthat the body of Lacoste contained some arsenical preparation.\n\nThe matter now appearing to be grave, additional scientific assurance\nwas sought. Three of the most distinguished chemists in Paris were\ncalled into service for a further analysis. They were MM. Devergie,\nPelouze, and Flandin. Their report ran in part:\n\n\nThe portion of the liver on which we have experimented proved to contain\na notable quantity of arsenic, amounting to more than five milligrammes;\nthe portions of the intestines and tissue examined also contained\nappreciable traces which, though in smaller proportion than contained by\nthe liver, accord with the known features of arsenical poisoning. There\nis no appearance of the toxic element in the earth taken from the grave\nor in the material of the coffin.\n\n\nAs soon as Mme Lacoste was apprised of the findings of the autopsy she\ngot into her carriage and was driven to Auch, where she visited a friend\nof her late husband and of herself. To him she announced her intention\nof surrendering herself to the Procureur du Roi. The friend strongly\nadvised her against doing any such thing, advice which Mme Lacoste\naccepted with reluctance.\n\nOn the 5th of January a summons to appear was issued for Mme Lacoste.\nShe was seen that day in Auch, walking the streets on the arm of a\nfriend. She even went to the post-office, but the police agents failed\nto find her. She stopped the night in the town. Next day she was at\nRiguepeu. She was getting out of her carriage when a servant pointed\nout gendarmes coming up the hill with the Mayor. When those officials\narrived Euphemie was well away. Search was made through the house and\noutbuildings, but without result. \"Don't bother yourself looking any\nfurther, Monsieur le Maire,\" said one of the servants. \"The mistress\nisn't far away, but she's in a place where I could hide a couple of oxen\nwithout you finding them.\"\n\nFrom then on Mme Lacoste was hunted for everywhere. The roads to Tarbes,\nToulouse, and Vic-Fezensac were patrolled by brigades of gendarmes day\nand night, but there was no sign of the fugitive. It was rumoured that\nshe had got away to Spain, that she was cached in a barrel at Riguepeu,\nthat she was in the fields disguised as a shepherd, that she had taken\nthe veil.\n\nIn the meantime the process against her went forward. Evidence was\nto hand which seemed to inculpate with Mme Lacoste a poor and old\nschoolmaster of Riguepeu named Joseph Meilhan. The latter, arrested,\nstoutly denied not only his own part in the supposed crime, but also\nthe guilt of Mme Lacoste. \"Why doesn't she come forward?\" he asked. \"She\nknows perfectly well she has nothing to fear--no more than I have.\"\n\nFrom the 'information' laid by the court of first instance at Auch a\nwarrant was issued for the appearance of Mme Lacoste and Meilhan before\nthe Assize of Gers. Mme Lacoste was apparently well instructed by her\nfriends. She did not come into the open until the last possible moment.\nShe gave herself up at the Auch prison on the 4th of July.\n\nHer health seemed to have suffered little from the vicissitudes of her\nflight. It was noticed that her hair was short, a fact which seemed to\npoint to her having disguised herself. But, it is said, she exhibited a\nserenity of mind which consorted ill with the idea of guilt. She faced\nan interrogation lasting three hours without faltering.\n\nOn the 10th of July she appeared before the Gers Assize Court, held at\nAuch. The President was M. Donnoderie. Counsel for the prosecution,\nas it were, was the Procureur du Roi, M. Cassagnol. Mme Lacoste was\ndefended by Maitre Alem-Rousseau, leader of the bar of Auch.\n\nThe case aroused the liveliest interest, people flocking to the town\nfrom as far away as Paris itself--so much so that at 6.30 in the morning\nthe one-time palace of the Archbishops of Auch, in the hall of which the\ncourt was held, was packed.\n\nThe accused were called. First to appear was Joseph Meilhan. He was\na stout little old boy of sixty-six, rosy and bright-eyed, with short\nwhite hair and heavy black eyebrows. He was calm and smiling, completely\nmaster of himself.\n\nMme Lacoste then appeared on the arm of her advocate. She was dressed\nin full widow's weeds. A little creature, slender but not rounded of\nfigure, she is described as more agreeable-looking than actually pretty.\n\nAfter the accused had answered with their names and descriptions the\nacte d'accusation was read. It was a long document. It recalled the\ncircumstances of the Lacoste marriage and of the death of the old man,\nwith the autopsy and the finding of traces of arsenic. It spoke of the\nlowly household tasks that Mme Lacoste had performed with such goodwill\nfrom the beginning, and of the reward for her diligence which came to\nher by the making of a holograph will in which her husband made her his\nsole heir.\n\nBut the understanding between husband and wife did not last long, the\nacte went on. Lacoste ardently desired a son and heir, and his wife\nappeared to be barren. He confided his grief to an old friend, one\nLespere. Lespere pointed out that Euphemie was not only Lacoste's wife,\nbut his kinswoman as well. To this Lacoste replied that the fact did\nnot content him. \"I tell you on the quiet,\" he said to his friend, \"I've\nmade my arrangements. If SHE knew--she's capable of poisoning me to get\nherself a younger man.\" Lespere told him not to talk rubbish, in effect,\nbut Lacoste was stubborn on his notion.\n\nThis was but a year after the marriage. It seemed that Lacoste had a\nmelancholy presentiment of the fate which was to be his.\n\nIt was made out that Euphemie suffered from the avarice and jealousy of\nher old husband. She was given no money, was hardly allowed out of the\nhouse, and was not permitted even to go to Vespers alone. And then, said\nthe accusation, she discovered that her husband wanted an heir. She\nhad reason to fear that he would go about getting one by an illicit\nassociation.\n\nIn the middle of 1842 she overheard her husband bargaining with one of\nthe domestics. The girl was asking for 100 pistoles (say, L85), while\nher husband did not want to give more than 600 francs (say, L24).\n\"Euphemie Verges had no doubt,\" ran the accusation, \"that this was the\nprice of an adulterous contract, and she insisted on Marie Dupuys' being\nsent from the house. This was the cause of disagreement between the\nmarried pair, which did not conclude with the departure of the servant.\"\n\nLater another servant, named Jacquette Larrieux, told Mme Lacoste in\nconfidence that the master was trying to seduce her by the offer of a\npension of 2000 francs or a lump sum of 20,000.\n\nEuphemie Verges, said the accusation, thus thought herself exposed\ndaily, by the infidelity of her husband, to the loss of all her hopes.\nAlso, talking to a Mme Bordes about the two servants some days after\nLacoste's death, she said, \"I had a bad time with those two girls! If my\nhusband had lived longer I might have had nothing, because he wanted a\nchild that he could leave everything to.\"\n\nThe acte d'accusation enlarged on the situation, then went on to bring\nin Joseph Meilhan as Euphemie's accomplice. It made him out to be a bad\nold man indeed. He had seduced, it was said, a young girl named Lescure,\nwho became enceinte, afterwards dying from an abortion which Meilhan was\naccused of having procured. It might be thought that the society of such\na bad old man would have disgusted a young woman, but Euphemie Verges\nadmitted him to intimacy. He was, it was said, the confidant for\nher domestic troubles, and it was further rumoured that he acted as\nintermediary in a secret correspondence that she kept up with a young\nman of Tarbes who had been courting her before her marriage. The\ncounsels of such a man were not calculated to help Mme Lacoste in her\nquarrels with her unfaithful and unlovable husband.\n\nMeanwhile M. Lacoste was letting new complaints be heard regarding his\nwife. Again Lespere was his confidant. His wife was bad and sulky. He\nwas very inclined to undo what he had done for her. This was in March of\n1843.\n\nTowards the end of April he made a like complaint to another old\nfriend, one Dupouy, who accused him of neglecting old friends through\nuxoriousness. Lacoste said he found little pleasure in his young wife.\nHe was, on the contrary, a martyr. He was on the point of disinheriting\nher.\n\nAnd so, with the usual amount of on dit and disait-on, the acte\nd'accusation came to the point of Lacoste at the Riguepeu fair. He set\nout in his usual health, but, several hours later, said to one Laffon,\n\"I have the shivers, cramps in the stomach. After being made to drink by\nthat ---- Meilhan I felt ill.\"\n\nDeparting from the fair alone, he met up with Jean Durieux, to whom he\nsaid, \"That ---- of a Meilhan asked me to have a drink, and afterwards I\nhad colic, and wanted to vomit.\"\n\nArrived home, Lacoste said to Pierre Cournet that he had been seized by\na colic which made him ill all over, plaguing him, giving him a desire\nto vomit which he could not satisfy. Cournet noticed that Lacoste was as\nwhite as a sheet. He advised going to bed and taking hot water. Lacoste\ntook the advice. During the night he was copiously sick. The old man was\nin bed in an alcove near the kitchen, but next night he was put into a\nroom out of the way of noise.\n\nEuphemie looked after her husband alone, preparing his drinks and\nadmitting nobody to see him. She let three days pass without calling a\ndoctor. Lacoste, it was true, had said he did not want a doctor, but,\nsaid the accusation, \"there is no proof that he persisted in that wish.\"\n\nOn the fourth day she sent a summary of the illness to Dr Boubee, asking\nfor written advice. On the fifth day a surgeon was called, M. Lasmolles,\nwho was told that Lacoste had eaten a meal of onions, garlic stems, and\nbeans. But the story of this meal was a lie, a premeditated lie. On the\neve of the fair Mme Lacoste was already speaking of such a meal, saying\nthat that sort of thing always made her husband ill.\n\nAccording to the accusation, the considerable amount of poison found in\nthe body established that the arsenic had been administered on several\noccasions, on the first by Meilhan and on the others by Mme Lacoste.\n\nWhen Henri Lacoste had drawn his last breath his wife shed a few tears.\nBut presently her grief gave place to other preoccupations. She herself\nlooked out the sheet for wrapping the corpse, and thereafter she began\nto search in the desk for the will which made her her husband's sole\nheir.\n\nNext day Meilhan, who had not once looked in on Lacoste during his\nillness, hastened to visit the widow. The widow invited him to dinner.\nThe day after that he dined with her again, and they were seen walking\ntogether. Their intimacy seemed to grow daily. But the friendship of\nMme Lacoste for Meilhan did not end there. Not very many days after\nthe death of Lacoste Meilhan met the Mayor of Riguepeu, M. Sabazan, and\nconducted him in a mysterious manner into his schoolroom. Telling the\nMayor that he knew him to be a man of discretion, he confided in him\nthat the Veuve Lacoste intended giving him (Meilhan) a bill on one\nCastera. Did the Mayor know Castera to be all right? The Mayor replied\nthat a bill on Castera was as good as gold itself. Meilhan said that Mme\nLacoste had assured him this was but the beginning of what she meant to\ndo for him.\n\nMeilhan wrote to Castera, who called on him. The schoolmaster told\nCastera that in return for 2000 francs which she had borrowed from him\nMme Lacoste had given him a note for 1772 francs, which was due from\nCastera to Henri Lacoste as part inheritance from a brother. Meilhan\nshowed Castera the original note, which was to be renewed in Meilhan's\nfavour. The accusation dwelt on the different versions regarding his\npossession of the note given by Meilhan to the Mayor and to Castera.\nMeilhan was demonstrably lying to conceal Mme Lacoste's liberality.\n\nSome little time after this Meilhan invited the Mayor a second time into\nthe schoolroom, and told him that Mme Lacoste meant to assure him of a\nlife annuity of 400 francs, and had asked him to prepare the necessary\ndocument for her to sign. But there was another proposition. If Meilhan\nwould return the note for 1772 francs owing by Castera she would make\nthe annuity up to 500. What, asked Meilhan, would M. le Maire do in\nhis place? The Mayor replied that in Meilhan's place he would keep the\nCastera note and be content with the 400 annuity. Then Meilhan asked\nthe Mayor to draw up for him a specimen of the document necessary for\ncreating the annuity. This M. Sabazan did at once, and gave the draft to\nMeilhan.\n\nSome days later still Meilhan told M. Sabazan that Mme Lacoste did not\nwish to use the form of document suggested by the Mayor, but had written\none herself. Meilhan showed the Mayor the widow's document, and begged\nhim to read it to see if it was in proper form. Sabazan read the\ndocument. It created an annuity of 400 francs, payable yearly in the\nmonth of August. The Mayor did not know actually if the deed was in\nthe writing of Mme Lacoste. He did not know her fist. But he could be\ncertain that it was not in Meilhan's hand.\n\nThis deed was later shown by Meilhan to the cure of Riguepeu, who saw\nat least that the deed was not in Meilhan's writing. He noticed that it\nshowed some mistakes, and that the signature of the Widow Lacoste began\nwith the word \"Euphemie.\"\n\nIn the month of August Meilhan was met coming out of Mme Lacoste's by\nthe Mayor. Jingling money in his pocket, the schoolmaster told the\nMayor he had just drawn the first payment of his annuity. Later Meilhan\nbragged to the cure of Basais that he was made for life. He took a\nhandful of louis from his pocket, and told the priest that this was his\ndaily allowance.\n\n\"Whence,\" demanded the acte d'accusation, \"came all those riches, if\nthey were not the price of his share in the crime?\"\n\nBut the good offices of Mme Lacoste towards Meilhan did not end with\nthe giving of money. In the month of August Meilhan was chased from his\nlodgings by his landlord, Lescure, on suspicion of having had intimate\nrelations with the landlord's wife. The intervention of the Mayor was\nineffective in bringing about a reconciliation between Meilhan and\nLescure. Meilhan begged Mme Lacoste to intercede, and where the Mayor\nhad failed she succeeded.\n\nWhile Mme Lacoste was thus smothering Meilhan with kindnesses she was\nlonging herself to make the most of the fortune which had come to her.\nFrom the first days of her widowhood she was constantly writing letters\nwhich Mme Lescure carried for her. Euphemie had already begun to talk of\nremarriage. Her choice was already made. \"If I marry again,\" she said, a\nfew days after the death of Lacoste, \"I won't take anybody but M. Henri\nBerens, of Tarbes. He was my first love.\"\n\nThe accusation told of Euphemie's departure for Tarbes, where almost\nher first caller was this M. Henri Berens. The next day she gave up\nthe lodgings rented by her late husband, to establish herself in rich\napartments owned by one Fourcade, which she furnished sumptuously. The\naccusation dwelt on her purchase of horses and a carriage and on her\nluxurious way of living. It also brought forward some small incidents\nillustrative of her distaste for the memory of her late husband. It\ndealt with information supplied by her landlord which indicated that her\nconscience was troubled. Twice M. Fourcade found her trembling, as with\nfear. On his asking her what was the matter she replied, \"I was thinking\nof my husband--if he saw me in a place furnished like this!\"\n\n(It need hardly be pointed out, considering the sour and avaricious\nways of her late husband, that Euphemie need not have been\nconscience-stricken with his murder to have trembled over her lavish\nexpenditure of his fortune. But the point is typical of the trivialities\nwith which the acte d'accusation was padded out.)\n\nThe accusation claimed that a young man had several times been seen\nleaving Euphemie's apartments at midnight, and spoke of protests made by\nMme Fourcade. Euphemie declared herself indifferent to public opinion.\n\nPublic opinion, however, beginning to rise against her, Euphemie had\nneed to resort to lying in order to explain her husband's death. To some\nshe repeated the story of the onion-garlic-and-beans meal, adding that,\nin spite of his indigestion, he had eaten gluttonously later in the day.\nTo others she attributed his illness to two indigestible repasts made at\nthe fair. To others again she said Lacoste had died of a hernia, forced\nout by his efforts to vomit. She was even accused of saying that\nthe doctor had attributed the death to this cause. This, said the\nindictment, was a lie. Dr Lasmolles declared that he had questioned\nLacoste about the supposed hernia, and that the old man denied having\nany such thing.\n\nWhat had brought about Lacoste's fatal illness was the wine Meilhan had\nmade him drink at Rigeupeu fair.\n\nWith the rise of suspicion against her and her accomplice, Mme Lacoste\nput up a brave front. She wrote to the Procureur du Roi, demanding an\nexhumation, with the belief, no doubt, that time would have effaced the\npoison. At the same time she sent the bailiff Labadie to Riguepeu, to\nfind out the names of those who were traducing her, and to say that she\nintended to prosecute her calumniators with the utmost rigour of the\nlaw. This, said the accusation, was nothing but a move to frighten the\nwitnesses against her into silence. Instead of making good her threats\nthe Widow Lacoste disappeared.\n\nOn the arrest of Meilhan search of his lodgings resulted in the finding\nof the note on Castera for 1772 francs, and of a sum of 800 francs in\ngold and silver. But of the deed creating the annuity of 400 francs\nthere was no trace.\n\nMeilhan denied everything. In respect of the wine he was said to have\ngiven Lacoste he said he had passed the whole of the 16th of May in the\ncompany of a friend called Mothe, and that Mothe could therefore prove\nMeilhan had never had a drink with Lacoste. Mothe, however, declared he\nhad left Meilhan that day at three o'clock in the afternoon, and it was\njust at this time that Meilhan had taken Lacoste into the auberge where\nhe lived to give him the poisoned drink. It was between three and four\nthat Lacoste first showed signs of being ill.\n\nAsked to explain the note for 1772 francs, Meilhan said that, about two\nmonths after Lacoste's death, the widow complained of not having any\nready money. She had the Castera note, and he offered to discount it\nfor her. This was a palpable lie, said the accusation. It was only a\nfew days after Lacoste's death that Meilhan spoke to the Mayor about\nthe Castera note. Meilhan's statement was full of discrepancies. He told\nCastera that he held the note against 2000 francs previously lent to\nthe widow. He now said that he had discounted the note on sight. But\nthe fact was that since Meilhan had come to live in Riguepeu he had been\nwithout resources. He had stripped himself in order to establish his son\nin a pharmacy at Vic-Fezensac. His profession of schoolmaster scarcely\nbrought him in enough for living expenses. How, then, could he possibly\nbe in a position to lend Mme Lacoste 2000 francs? And how had he managed\nto collect the 800 odd francs that were found in his lodgings? The\nreal explanation lay in the story he had twice given to the Mayor, M.\nSabazan: he was in possession of the Castera note through the generosity\nof his accomplice.\n\nMeilhan was in still greater difficulty to explain the document which\nhad settled on him an annuity of 400 francs, and which had been seen in\nhis hands. Denial was useless, since he had asked the Mayor to make a\ndraft for him, and since he had shown that functionary the deed signed\nby Mme Lacoste. Here, word for word, is the explanation given by the\nrubicund Joseph:\n\n\"My son,\" he said, \"kept asking me to contribute to the upkeep of one of\nhis boys who is in the seminary of Vic-Fezensac. I consistently refused\nto do so, because I wanted to save what little I might against the time\nwhen I should be unable to work any longer. Six months ago my son wrote\nto the cure, begging him to speak to me. The cure, not wishing to do\nso, sent on the letter to the Mayor, who communicated with me. I replied\nthat I did not wish to do anything, adding that I intended investing my\nsavings in a life annuity. At the same time I begged M. Sabazan to make\nme a draft in the name of Mme Lacoste. She knew nothing about it. M.\nSabazan sent me on the draft. It seemed to me well drawn up. I rewrote\nit, and showed it to M. Sabazan. At the foot of the deed I put the words\n'Veuve Lacoste,' but I had been at pains to disguise my handwriting.\nI did all this with the intention of making my son believe, when my\ninfirmities obliged me to retire to his household, that my income came\nfrom a life annuity some one had given me; and to hide from him where\nI had put my capital I wanted to persuade M. Sabazan that the deed\nactually existed, so that he could bear witness to the fact to my son.\"\nHere, said the accusation, Meilhan was trying to make out that it was on\nthe occasion of a letter from his son that he had spoken to the Mayor of\nthe annuity.\n\nThe cure of Riguepeu, however, while admitting that he had received\nsuch a letter from Meilhan's son, declared that this was long before\nthe death of Henri Lacoste. The Mayor also said that he had spoken\nto Meilhan of his son's letter well before the time when the accused\nmentioned the annuity to him and asked for a draft of the assignment.\n\nThe accusation ridiculed Meilhan's explanation, dubbing it just\nanother of the schoolmaster's lies. It brought forward a contradictory\nexplanation given by Meilhan to one Thener, a surgeon, whom he knew to\nbe in frequent contact with the son whom the document was intended to\ndeceive. Meilhan informed Thener that he had fabricated the deed, and\nhad shown it round, in order to inspire such confidence in him as would\nsecure him refuge when he had to give up schoolmastering.\n\nThese contradictory and unbelievable explanations were the fruit of\nMeilhan's efforts to cover the fact that the annuity was the price paid\nhim by the Widow Lacoste for his part in the murder of her husband. It\nwas to be remembered that M. Sabazan, whose testimony was impeccable,\nhad seen Meilhan come from the house of Mme Lacoste, and that Meilhan\nhad jingled money, saying he had just drawn the first payment of his\nannuity.\n\nThe accusation, in sum, concentrated on the suspicious relationship\nbetween Meilhan and the Widow Lacoste. It was a long document, but\nsomething lacking in weight of proof--proof of the actual murder, that\nis, if not of circumstance.\n\n\n\nV\n\nThe process in a French criminal court was--and still is--somewhat\nlong-winded. The Procureur du Roi had to go over the accusation in\ndetail, making the most of Mme Lacoste's intimacy with the ill-reputed\nold fellow. That parishioner, far from being made indignant by the\nanimadversions of M. Cassagnol, listened to the recital of his misdeeds\nwith a faint smile. He was perhaps a little astonished at some of the\npoints made against him, but, it is said, contented himself with\na gesture of denial to the jury, and listened generally as if with\npleasure at hearing himself so well spoken of.\n\nHe was the first of the accused to be questioned.\n\nIt was brought out that he had been a soldier under the Republic, and\nthen for a time had studied pharmacy. He had been a corn-merchant in a\nsmall way, and then had started schoolmaster.\n\nEndeavour was made to get him to admit guilty knowledge of the death of\nthe Lescure girl. He had never even heard of an abortion. The girl had\na stomach-ache. This line failing, he was interrogated on the matter of\nbeing chased from his lodgings by the landlord-father, it would seem, of\nthe aforementioned girl. (It may be noted that Meilhan lived on in the\nauberge after her death.) Meilhan had an innocent explanation of the\nincident. It was all a mistake on the part of Lescure. And he hadn't\nbeen chased out of the auberge. He had simply gone out with his coat\nslung about his shoulders. Mme Lacoste went with him to patch the matter\nup.\n\nHe had not given Lacoste a drink, hadn't even spoken with him, at the\nRiguepeu fair, but had passed the day with M. Mothe. Cournet had told\nhim of Lacoste's having a headache, but had said nothing of vomitings.\nHe had not seen Lacoste during the latter's illness, because Lacoste was\nseeing nobody.\n\nThis business of the annuity had got rather entangled, but he would\nexplain. He had lodged 1772 francs with Mme Lacoste, and she had given\nhim a bill on Castera. Whether he had given the money before or after\ngetting the bill he could not be sure. He thought afterwards. He had\nforgotten the circumstances while in prison.\n\nMeilhan stuck pretty firmly to his story that it was to deceive his son\nthat he had fabricated the deed of annuity. He couldn't help it if the\nstory sounded thin. It was the fact.\n\nHow had he contrived to save, as he said, 3000 francs? His yearly income\nduring his six years at Riguepeu had been only 500 francs. The court had\nreason to be surprised.\n\n\"Ah! You're surprised!\" exclaimed Meilhan, rather put out. But at\nBreuzeville, where he was before Riguepeu, he had bed and board free. In\nRiguepeu he had nothing off the spit for days on end. He spent only 130\nfrancs a year, he said, giving details. And then he did a little trade\nin corn.\n\nHe had destroyed the annuity deed only because it was worthless. As for\nwhat he had said to the Mayor about drawing his first payment of the\npension, he had done it because he was a bit conscience-stricken over\nfabricating the deed. He had been bragging--that was all.\n\nThe President, having already chidden Meilhan for being prolix in his\nanswers, now scolded him for anticipating the questions. But the fact\nwas that Meilhan was not to be pinned down.\n\nThe first questions put to Mme Lacoste were with regard to her marriage\nand her relations with her husband. She admitted, incidentally, having\nbegun to receive a young man some six weeks after her husband's death,\nbut she had not known him before marriage. Meilhan had carried no\nletters between them. She had married Lacoste of her own free will.\nLacoste had not asked any attentions from her that were not ordinarily\nsought by a husband, and her care of him had been spontaneous. It was\ntrue he was jealous, but he had not formally forbidden her pleasures.\nShe had renounced them, knowing he was easily upset. It was true that\nshe had seldom gone out, but she had never wanted to. Lacoste was no\nmore avaricious than most, and it was untrue that he had denied her any\nnecessaries.\n\nTaken to the events of the fair day, Tuesday, the 16th of May, Mme\nLacoste maintained that her husband, on his return, complained only of\na headache. He had gone to bed early, but he usually did. That night he\nslept in the same alcove as herself, but next night they separated.\nIn spite of the contrary evidence of witnesses, of which the President\nreminded her, Mme Lacoste firmly maintained that it was not until the\nWednesday-Thursday night that Lacoste started to vomit. It was not until\nthat night that she began to attend to him. She had given him lemonade,\nwashed him, and so on.\n\nThe President was saying that nobody had been allowed near him, and that\na doctor was not called, when the accused broke in with a lively denial.\nAnybody who wanted to could see him, and a doctor was called. This was\ntowards the last, the President pointed out. Mme Lacoste's advocate\nintervened here, saying that it was the husband who did not wish a\ndoctor called, for reasons of his own. The President begged to be\nallowed to hear the accused's own answers. He pointed out that the\nministrations of the accused had effected no betterment, but that the\nillness had rapidly got worse. The delay in calling a doctor seemed to\nlend a strange significance to the events.\n\nMme Lacoste answered in lively fashion, accenting her phrases with the\nuse of her hands: \"But, monsieur, you do not take into account that it\nwas not until the night of Wednesday and the Thursday that my husband\nbegan to vomit, and that it was two days after that he--he succumbed.\"\n\nThe President said a way remained of fixing the dates and clearing up\nthe point. He had a letter written by M. Lacoste to the doctor in which\nhe himself explained the state of his illness. It was pointed out to\nhim that the letter had been written by Mme Lacoste at her husband's\ndictation.\n\nThe letter was dated the 19th (Friday). It was directed to M. Boubee,\ndoctor of medicine, in Vic-Fezensac. Perhaps it would be better to give\nit in the original language. It is something frank in detail:\n\n\nDepuis quelque temps j'avais perdu l'appetit et m'endormais de suite\nquand j'etais assis. Mercredi il me vint un secours de nature par un\nvomissement extraordinaire. Ces vomissements m'ont dure pendant un jour\net une nuit; je ne rendais que de la bile. La nuit passee, je n'en ai\npas rendu; dans ce moment, j'en rends encore. Vous sentez combien ces\nefforts reiteres m'ont fatigue; ces grands efforts m'ont fait partir de\nla bile par en bas; je vous demanderai, monsieur, si vous ne trouveriez\npas a propos que je prisse une medecine d'huile de ricin ou autre,\ncelle que vous jugerez a propos. Je vous demanderai aussi si je pourrais\nprendre quelques bains. [signe]\n\nLACOSTE PHILIBERT\n\n\nJe rends beaucoup de vents par en bas. Pour la boisson, je ne bois que\nde l'eau chaude et de l'eau sucree. (Il n'y a pas eu de fievre encore.)\n\n\nThe Procureur du Roi maintained that this letter showed the invalid had\nalready been taken with vomiting before it was considered necessary to\ncall in a doctor. But Mme Lacoste's advocate pointed out that the\nletter was written by her, when she had overcome Lacoste's distaste for\ndoctors.\n\nThe President made much of the fact that Mme Lacoste had undertaken even\nthe lowliest of the attentions necessary in a sick-room, when other,\nmore mercenary, hands could have been engaged in them. The accusation\nfrom this was that she did these things from a desire to destroy\nincriminating evidences. Mme Lacoste replied that she had done\neverything out of affection for her husband.\n\nAsked by the court why she had not thought to give Dr Boubee any\nexplanations of the illness, she replied that she knew her husband was\nalways ill, but that he hid his maladies and was ashamed of them. He\nhad, it appeared, hernias, tetters, and other maladies besides. It was\neasy for her to gather as much, in spite of the mystery Lacoste made of\nthem; she had seen him rubbing his limbs at times with medicaments, and\nat others she had seen him taking medicines internally. He was always\nvexed when she found him at it. She did not know what doctor prescribed\nthe medicaments, nor the pharmacist who supplied them. Her husband\nthought he knew more than the doctors, and usually dealt with quacks.\n\nMme Lacoste was questioned regarding her husband's will, and on his\nlonging to have an heir of his own blood. She knew of the will, but did\nnot hear any word of his desire to alter it until after his death. With\nregard to Lacoste's attempts to seduce the servants, she declared this\nwas a vague affair, and she had found the first girl in question a place\nelsewhere.\n\nHer letter to the Procureur du Roi demanding an exhumation and justice\nagainst her slanderers was read. Then a second one, in which she excused\nher absence, saying that she would give herself up for judgment at\nthe right time, and begged him to add her letter to the papers of the\nprocess.\n\nThe President then returned to the question of her husband's attempts\nto seduce the servants. She denied that this was the cause of quarrels.\nThere had been no quarrels. She did not know that her husband was\ncomplaining outside about her.\n\nShe denied all knowledge of the arsenic found in Lacoste's body, but\nsuggested that it might have come from one or other of the medicines he\ntook.\n\nQuestioned with regard to her intimacy with Meilhan, she declared that\nshe knew nothing of his morals. She had intervened in the Lescure affair\nat the request of Mme Lescure, who came to deny the accusation made by\nLescure. This woman had never acted as intermediary between herself and\nMeilhan. Meilhan had not been her confidant. She looked after her late\nhusband's affairs herself. She had handed over the Castera note to\nMeilhan against his loan of 2000 francs, but she had never given him\nmoney as a present. Nor had she ever spoken to Meilhan of an annuity.\nBut Meilhan, it was objected, had been showing a deed signed \"Euphemie\nLacoste.\" The accused quickly replied that she never signed herself\n\"Euphemie,\" but as \"Veuve Lacoste.\" Upon this the President called for\nseveral letters written by the accused. It was found that they were all\nsigned \"Veuve Lacoste.\"\n\nThe evidence of the Fourcades regarding her conduct in their house at\nTarbes was biased, she said. She had refused to take up some people\nrecommended by her landlady. The young man who had visited her never\nremained longer than after ten o'clock or half-past, and she saw nothing\nsingular in that.\n\nThe examination-in-chief of Mme Lacoste ended with her firm declaration\nthat she knew nothing of the poisoning of her husband, and that she\nhad spoken the truth through all her interrogations. Some supplementary\nquestions were answered by her to the effect that she knew, during\nher marriage, that her husband had at one time suffered from venereal\ndisease; and that latterly there had been recrudescences of the\naffection, together with the hernia already mentioned, for which her\nhusband took numerous medicaments.\n\nThroughout this long examination Mme Lacoste showed complete\nself-possession, save that at times she exhibited a Gascon impatience in\nanswering what she conceived to be stupid questions.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nThe experts responsible for the analysis of Lacoste's remains were now\ncalled. All three of those gentlemen from Paris, MM. Pelouze, Devergie,\nand Flandin, agreed in their findings. Two vessels were exhibited, on\nwhich there glittered blobs of some metallic substance. This substance,\nthe experts deposed, was arsenic obtained by the Marsh technique from\nthe entrails and the muscular tissue from Lacoste's body. They could be\nsure that the substances used as reagents in the experiments were pure,\nand that the earth about the body was free from arsenic.\n\nM. Devergie said that science did not admit the presence of arsenic as\na normal thing in the human body. What was not made clear by the expert\nwas whether the amount of arsenic found in the body of Lacoste was\nconsistent with the drug's having been taken in small doses, or whether\nit had been given in one dose. Devergie's confrere Flandin later\ndeclared his conviction that the death of Lacoste was due to one dose of\nthe poison, but, from a verbatim report, it appears that he did not give\nany reason for the opinion.\n\nAt this point Mme Lacoste was recalled, and repeated her statement that\nshe had seen her husband rubbing himself with an ointment and drinking\nsome white liquid on the return of a syphilitic affection.\n\nDr Lasmolles testified that Lacoste, though very close-mouthed, had told\nhim of a skin affection that troubled him greatly. The deceased dosed\nhimself, and did not obey the doctors' orders. It was only from a farmer\nthat he understood Lacoste to have a hernia, and Lacoste himself did\nnot admit it. The doctor did not believe the man poisoned. He had been\nimpressed by the way Mme Lacoste looked after her husband, and the\nlatter did not complain about anyone. M. Lasmolles had heard no mention\nfrom Lacoste of the glass of wine given him by Meilhan.\n\nAfter M. Devergie had said that he had heard of arsenical remedies used\nexternally for skin diseases, but never of any taken internally, M.\nPlandin expressed his opinion as before quoted.\n\nThe next witness was one Dupouy, of whom some mention has already been\nmade. Five days before his death Lacoste told him that, annoyed with\nhis wife, he definitely intended to disinherit her. Dupouy admitted,\nhowever, that shortly before this the deceased had spoken of taking a\npleasure trip with Mme Lacoste.\n\nLespere then repeated his story of the complaints made to him by Lacoste\nof his wife's conduct, of his intention of altering his will, and of\nhis belief that Euphemie was capable of poisoning him in order to get a\nyounger man. It was plain that this witness, a friend of Lacoste's for\nforty-six years, was not ready to make any admissions in her favour. He\nswore that Lacoste had told him his wife did not know she was his\nsole heir. He was allowed to say that on the death of Lacoste he had\nimmediately assumed that the poisoning feared by Lacoste had been\nbrought about. He had heard nothing from Lacoste of secret maladies or\nsecret remedies, but had been so deep in Lacoste's confidence that he\nfelt sure his old friend would have mentioned them. He had heard of such\nthings only at the beginning of the case.\n\nThe Procureur du Roi remarked here that reliance on the secret remedies\nwas the 'system' of the defence.\n\nThat seemed to be the case. The 'system' of the prosecution, on the\nother hand, was to snatch at anything likely to appear as evidence\nagainst the two accused. The points mainly at issue were as follows:\n\n(1) Did Meilhan have a chance of giving Lacoste a drink at the fair?\n\n(2) Did Lacoste become violently sick immediately on his return from the\nfair?\n\n(3) Did Lacoste suffer from the ailments attributed to him by his wife,\nand was he in the habit of dosing himself?\n\n(4) Did Meilhan receive money from Mme Lacoste, and, particularly, did\nshe propose to allow him the supposed annuity?\n\n\nWith regard to (1), several witnesses declared that Lacoste had\ncomplained to them of feeling ill after drinking with Meilhan, but none\ncould speak of seeing the two men together. M. Mothe, the friend\ncited by Meilhan, less positive in his evidence in court than the acte\nd'accusation made him out to be, could not remember if it was on the\n16th of May that he had spent the whole afternoon with Meilhan. It was\nso much his habit to be with Meilhan during the days of the fair that\nhe had no distinct recollection of any of them. Another witness, having\nbusiness with Lacoste, declared that on the day in question it was\nimpossible for Meilhan to have been alone with Lacoste during the time\nthat the latter was supposed to have taken the poisoned drink. Lescure,\nin whose auberge Lacoste was supposed to have had the drink, failed to\nremember such an incident. The evidence that Meilhan had given Lacoste\nthe drink was all second-hand; that to the contrary was definite.\n\nFor the most part the evidence with regard to (2), that Lacoste became\nvery ill immediately on his return from the fair, was hearsay. The\nservants belonging to the Lacoste household all maintained that\nthe vomiting did not seize the old man until the night of\nWednesday-Thursday. Indeed, two witnesses testified that the old man, in\nspite of his supposed headache, essayed to show them how well he could\ndance. This was on his return from the fair where he was supposed\nto have been given a poisoned drink at three o'clock. The evidence\nregarding the seclusion of Lacoste by his wife was contradictory, but\nthe most direct of it maintained that it was the old man himself, if\nanyone, who wanted to be left alone. On this point arises the question\nof the delay in calling the doctor. Witness after witness testified to\nLacoste's hatred of the medical faculty and to his preference for dosing\nhimself. He declared his faith in a local vet.\n\nOn (3), the bulk of the evidence against Lacoste's having the suggested\nafflictions came simply from witnesses who had not heard of them.\nThere was, on the contrary, quite a number of witnesses to declare that\nLacoste did suffer from a skin disease, and that he was in the habit\nof using quack remedies, the stronger the better. It was also testified\nthat Lacoste was in the habit of prescribing his remedies for other\npeople. A witness declared that a woman to whom Lacoste had given\nmedicine for an indisposition had become crippled, and still was\ncrippled.\n\nWith regard to (4), the Mayor merely repeated the evidence given in\nhis first statement, but the cure', who also saw the deed assigning an\nannuity to Meilhan, said that it was not in Mme Lacoste's writing, and\nthat it was signed with the unusual \"Euphemie.\" This last witness added\nthat Mme Lacoste's reputation was irreproachable, and that her relations\nwith her husband were happy.\n\nEvidence from a business-man in Tarbes showed that Mme Lacoste's\nhandling of her fortune was careful to a degree, her expenditure being\nwell within her income. This witness also proved that the Fourcades'\nevidence of Euphemie's misbehaviour could have been dictated from spite.\nFourcade had been found out in what looked like a swindle over money\nwhich he owed to the Lacoste estate.\n\nThe court then went more deeply into the medico-legal evidence. It were\ntedious to follow the course of this long argument. After a lengthy\ndissertation on the progress of an acute indigestion and the effects of\na strangulated hernia M. Devergie said that, as the poison existed in\nthe body, from the symptoms shown in the illness it could be assumed\nthat death had resulted from arsenic. The duration of the illness was in\naccord with the amount of arsenic found.\n\nM. Flandin agreed with this, but M. Pelouze abstained from expressing\nan opinion. He, however, rather gave the show away, by saying that if\nhe was a doctor he would take care to forbid any arsenical preparations.\n\"These preparations,\" he said moodily, \"can introduce a melancholy\nobscurity into the investigations of criminal justice.\"\n\nSome sense was brought into the discussion by Dr Molas, of Auch. He put\nforward the then accepted idea of the accumulation of arsenic taken in\nsmall doses, and the power of this accumulation, on the least accident,\nof determining death.\n\nThis was rather like chucking a monkey-wrench into the cerebration\nmachinery of the Paris experts. They admitted that the absorption and\nelimination of arsenic varied with the individual, and generally handed\nthe case over to the defence. M. Devergie was the only one who stuck\nout, but only partially even then. \"I persist in believing,\" he said,\n\"that M. Lacoste succumbed to poisoning by arsenic; but I use the word\n'poisoning' only from the point of view of science: arsenic killed him.\"\n\n\n\nVII\n\nThe speech of the Procureur du Roi was another resume of the acte\nd'accusation, with consideration of that part of the evidence which\nsuited him best.\n\nThis was followed by the speech of Maitre Canteloup in defence of\nMeilhan. The speech was a good effort which demonstrated that, whatever\nrumour might accuse the schoolmaster of, there were plenty of people of\nstanding who had found him upright and free from stain through a long\nlife. It reproached the accusation with jugglery over dates and so\nforth in support of its case, and confidently predicted the acquittal of\nMeilhan.\n\nThen followed the speech of Maitre Alem-Rousseau on behalf of the Veuve\nLacoste. Among other things the advocate brought forward the fact that\nEuphemie was not so poorly born as the prosecution had made out, but\nthat she had every chance of inheriting some 20,000 francs from her\nparents. It was notorious that when Henri Lacoste first broached the\nsubject of marriage with Euphemie he was not so rich as he afterwards\nbecame, but, in fact, believed he had lost the inheritance from his\nbrother Philibert, this last having made a will in favour of a young\nman of whom popular rumour made him the father. This was in 1839. The\nmarriage was celebrated in May of 1841. Henri Lacoste, it is true, had\nhidden his intentions, but when news of the marriage reached the ears\nof brother Philibert that brother was so delighted that he destroyed the\nwill which disinherited Henri. It was thus right to say that Euphemie\nbecame the benefactor of her husband. Where was the speculative marriage\non the part of Euphemie that the prosecution talked about?\n\nMaitre Alem-Rousseau made short work of the medico-legal evidence (he\nhad little bother with the facts of the illness). Poison was found in\nthe body. The question was, how had it got there? Was it quite certain\nthat arsenic could not get into the human body save by ingestion, that\nit could not exist in the human body normally? The science of the day\nsaid no, he knew, but the science of yesterday had said yes. Who knew\nwhat the science of to-morrow would say?\n\nThe advocate made use of the evidence of a witness whose testimony I\nhave failed to find in the accounts of the trial. This witness spoke\nof Lacoste's having asked, in Bordeaux, for a certain liquor of\n\"Saint-Louis,\" a liquor which Mme Lacoste took to be an anisette. \"No,\"\nsaid Lacoste, \"women don't take it.\" Maitre Alem-Rousseau had tried to\ndiscover what this liquor of Saint-Louis was. During the trial he had\ncome upon the fact that the arsenical preparation known as Fowler's\nsolution had been administered for the first time in the hospital of\nSaint-Louis, in Paris. He showed an issue of the Hospital Gazette in\nwhich the advertisement could be read: \"Solution de Fowler telle qu'on\nl'administre a SAINT-LOUIS!\" The jury could make what they liked of that\nfact.\n\nThe advocate now produced documents to prove that the marriage of\nEuphemie with her grand-uncle had not been so much to her advantage, but\nhad been--it must have been--a marriage of affection. At the time when\nthe marriage was arranged, he proved, Lacoste had no more than 35,000\nfrancs to his name. Euphemie had 15,000 francs on her marriage and the\nhope of 20,000 francs more. The pretence of the prosecution, that her\ncontentment with the abject duties which she had to perform in the\nhouse was dictated by interest, fell to the ground with the preliminary\nassumption that she had married for her husband's money.\n\nMaitre Alem, defending the widow's gayish conduct after her husband's\ndeath, declared it to be natural enough. It had been shown to be\ninnocent. He trounced the Press for helping to exaggerate the rumours\nwhich envy of Mme Lacoste's good fortune had created. He asked the jury\nto acquit Mme Lacoste.\n\nThe Procureur du Roi had another say. It was again an attempt to destroy\nthe 'system' of the defence, but by making a mystery of the fact that\nthe Lacoste-Verges marriage had not taken place in a church he gave the\nwily Maitre Alem an opportunity for following him.\n\nThe summing-up of the President on the third day of the trial was, it is\nsaid, a model of clarity and impartiality. The jury returned on all the\npoints put to them a verdict of \"Not guilty\" for both the accused.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nAnother verdict may now seem to have been hardly possible. The\naccusation was built up on the jealousy of neighbours, on chance\ncircumstances, on testimonies founded on petty spite. But, combined with\nthe medico-legal evidence, the weight of circumstance might easily have\nhoisted the accused in the balance.\n\nIt will be seen, then, how much on foot the case of the Veuve Lacoste\nwas with that of the Veuve Boursier, twenty years before.\n\nIt is on the experience of cases such as these two that the technique\nof investigation into arsenical poison has been evolved. In the case of\nVeuve Boursier you find M. Orfila discovering oxide of arsenic where M.\nBarruel saw only grains of fat. Four years previous to the case of the\nVeuve Lacoste that same Orfila came into the trial of Mme Lafarge with\nthe first use in medical jurisprudence of the Marsh test, and based\non the experiment a cocksure opinion which had much to do with the\ncondemnation of that unfortunate woman. In the Lacoste trial you find\nthe Parisian experts giving an opinion of no greater value than that\nof Orfila's in the Lafarge case, but find also an element of doubt\nintroduced by the country practitioner, with his common sense on the\nthen moot question of the accumulation, the absorption, and elimination\nof the drug.\n\nNowadays we are quite certain that our experts in medical jurisprudence\nknow all there is to know about arsenical poisoning. What are the\nchances, however, in spite of our apparently well-founded faith, that\nsome bristle-headed local chemist with a fighting chin will not\nspring up at an arsenic-poisoning trial and, with new facts about the\nsubstance, blow to pieces the cocksure evidence of the leading expert\nin pathology? It may seem impossible that such a thing can ever happen\nagain--a mistake regarding the action of arsenic on the human body. But\nwhen we discover it becoming a commonplace of science that one human may\nbe poisoned by an everyday substance which thousands of his fellows\neat with enjoyment as well as impunity--a substance, for instance, as\neveryday as porridge--who will dare say even now that the last word has\nbeen said and written of arsenic?\n\nBut that, as the late George Moore so doted on saying, is quelconque. M.\nOrfila, sure about the grocer of the Rue de la Paix, was defeated by M.\nBarruel. M. Orfila, sure about the death of Charles Lafarge, is declared\nby to-day's experts in criminal jurisprudence and pathology to have been\ntalking through his hat. According to the present experts, says \"Philip\nCurtin,\" Lafarge was not poisoned at all, but died a natural death.\nBecause of M. Devergie it was for the Veuve Lacoste as much 'touch and\ngo' as it was for the Veuve Boursier twenty years before.
