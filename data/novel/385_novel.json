It\nwas Delaney's pride, as it was also his trouble.\n\nRed Gilbat was nutty--and his batting average was .371.  Any student of\nbaseball could weigh these two facts against each other and understand\nsomething of Delaney's trouble.  It was not possible to camp on Red\nGilbat's trail.  The man was a jack-o'-lantern, a will-o'-the-wisp, a\nweird, long-legged, long-armed, red-haired illusive phantom. When the\ngong rang at the ball grounds there were ten chances to one that Red\nwould not be present.  He had been discovered with small boys peeping\nthrough knotholes at the vacant left field he was supposed to inhabit\nduring play.\n\nOf course what Red did off the ball grounds was not so important as\nwhat he did on.  And there was absolutely no telling what under the sun\nhe might do then except once out of every three times at bat he could\nbe counted on to knock the cover off the ball.\n\nReddy Clammer was a grand-stand player--the kind all managers\nhated--and he was hitting .305. He made circus catches, circus stops,\ncircus throws, circus steals--but particularly circus catches.  That is\nto say, he made easy plays appear difficult.  He was always strutting,\nposing, talking, arguing, quarreling--when he was not engaged in making\na grand-stand play.  Reddy Clammer used every possible incident and\nartifice to bring himself into the limelight.\n\nReddie Ray had been the intercollegiate champion in the sprints and a\nfamous college ball player.  After a few months of professional ball he\nwas hitting over .400 and leading the league both at bat and on the\nbases.  It was a beautiful and a thrilling sight to see him run.  He\nwas so quick to start, so marvelously swift, so keen of judgment, that\nneither Delaney nor any player could ever tell the hit that he was not\ngoing to get.  That was why Reddie Ray was a whole game in himself.\n\nDelaney's Rochester Stars and the Providence Grays were tied for first\nplace.  Of the present series each team had won a game.  Rivalry had\nalways been keen, and as the teams were about to enter the long\nhomestretch for the pennant there was battle in the New England air.\n\nThe September day was perfect.  The stands were half full and the\nbleachers packed with a white-sleeved mass.  And the field was\nbeautifully level and green.  The Grays were practicing and the Stars\nwere on their bench.\n\n\"We're up against it,\" Delaney was saying. \"This new umpire, Fuller,\nhasn't got it in for us. Oh, no, not at all!  Believe me, he's a\nrobber. But Scott is pitchin' well.  Won his last three games.  He'll\nbother 'em.  And the three Reds have broken loose.  They're on the\nrampage. They'll burn up this place today.\"\n\nSomebody noted the absence of Gilbat.\n\nDelaney gave a sudden start.  \"Why, Gil was here,\" he said slowly.\n\"Lord!--he's about due for a nutty stunt.\"\n\nWhereupon Delaney sent boys and players scurrying about to find Gilbat,\nand Delaney went himself to ask the Providence manager to hold back the\ngong for a few minutes.\n\nPresently somebody brought Delaney a telephone message that Red Gilbat\nwas playing ball with some boys in a lot four blocks down the street.\nWhen at length a couple of players marched up to the bench with Red in\ntow Delaney uttered an immense sigh of relief and then, after a close\nscrutiny of Red's face, he whispered, \"Lock the gates!\"\n\nThen the gong rang.  The Grays trooped in. The Stars ran out, except\nGilbat, who ambled like a giraffe.  The hum of conversation in the\ngrand stand quickened for a moment with the scraping of chairs, and\nthen grew quiet.  The bleachers sent up the rollicking cry of\nexpectancy.  The umpire threw out a white ball with his stentorian\n\"Play!\" and Blake of the Grays strode to the plate.\n\nHitting safely, he started the game with a rush. With Dorr up, the Star\ninfield played for a bunt. Like clockwork Dorr dumped the first ball as\nBlake got his flying start for second base.  Morrissey tore in for the\nball, got it on the run and snapped it underhand to Healy, beating the\nrunner by an inch.  The fast Blake, with a long slide, made third base.\nThe stands stamped.  The bleachers howled.  White, next man up, batted\na high fly to left field.  This was a sun field and the hardest to play\nin the league.  Red Gilbat was the only man who ever played it well.\nHe judged the fly, waited under it, took a step hack, then forward, and\ndeliberately caught the ball in his gloved hand.  A throw-in to catch\nthe runner scoring from third base would have been futile, but it was\nnot like Red Gilbat to fail to try.  He tossed the ball to O'Brien.\nAnd Blake scored amid applause.\n\n\"What do you know about that?\" ejaculated Delaney, wiping his moist\nface.  \"I never before saw our nutty Redhead pull off a play like that.\"\n\nSome of the players yelled at Red, \"This is a two-handed league, you\nbat!\"\n\nThe first five players on the list for the Grays were left-handed\nbatters, and against a right-handed pitcher whose most effective ball\nfor them was a high fast one over the outer corner they would naturally\nhit toward left field.  It was no surprise to see Hanley bat a\nskyscraper out to left. Red had to run to get under it.  He braced\nhimself rather unusually for a fielder.  He tried to catch the ball in\nhis bare right hand and muffed it, Hanley got to second on the play\nwhile the audience roared.  When they got through there was some\nroaring among the Rochester players.  Scott and Captain Healy roared at\nRed, and Red roared back at them.\n\n\"It's all off.  Red never did that before,\" cried Delaney in despair.\n\"He's gone clean bughouse now.\"\n\nBabcock was the next man up and he likewise hit to left.  It was a low,\ntwisting ball--half fly, half liner--and a difficult one to field.\nGilbat ran with great bounds, and though he might have got two hands on\nthe ball he did not try, but this time caught it in his right, retiring\nthe side.\n\nThe Stars trotted in, Scott and Healy and Kane, all veterans, looking\nlike thunderclouds.  Red ambled in the last and he seemed very\nnonchalant.\n\n\"By Gosh, I'd 'a' ketched that one I muffed if I'd had time to change\nhands,\" he said with a grin, and he exposed a handful of peanuts.  He\nhad refused to drop the peanuts to make the catch with two hands.  That\nexplained the mystery.  It was funny, yet nobody laughed.  There was\nthat run chalked up against the Stars, and this game had to be won.\n\n\"Red, I--I want to take the team home in the lead,\" said Delaney, and\nit was plain that he suppressed strong feeling.  \"You didn't play the\ngame, you know.\"\n\nRed appeared mightily ashamed.\n\n\"Del, I'll git that run back,\" he said.\n\nThen he strode to the plate, swinging his wagon-tongue bat.  For all\nhis awkward position in the box he looked what he was--a formidable\nhitter. He seemed to tower over the pitcher--Red was six feet one--and\nhe scowled and shook his bat at Wehying and called, \"Put one over--you\nwienerwurst!\"  Wehying was anything but red-headed, and he wasted so\nmany balls on Red that it looked as if he might pass him.  He would\nhave passed him, too, if Red had not stepped over on the fourth ball\nand swung on it.  White at second base leaped high for the stinging\nhit, and failed to reach it.  The ball struck and bounded for the\nfence.  When Babcock fielded it in,  Red was standing on third base,\nand the bleachers groaned.\n\nWhereupon Chesty Reddy Clammer proceeded to draw attention to himself,\nand incidentally delay the game, by assorting the bats as if the\naudience and the game might gladly wait years to see him make a choice.\n\n\"Git in the game!\" yelled Delaney.\n\n\"Aw, take my bat, Duke of the Abrubsky!\" sarcastically said Dump Kane.\nWhen the grouchy Kane offered to lend his bat matters were critical in\nthe Star camp.\n\nOther retorts followed, which Reddy Clammer deigned not to notice.  At\nlast he got a bat that suited him--and then, importantly, dramatically,\nwith his cap jauntily riding his red locks, he marched to the plate.\n\nSome wag in the bleachers yelled into the silence, \"Oh, Maggie, your\nlover has come!\"\n\nNot improbably Clammer was thinking first of his presence before the\nmultitude, secondly of his batting average and thirdly of the run to be\nscored.  In this instance he waited and feinted at balls and fouled\nstrikes at length to work his base. When he got to first base suddenly\nhe bolted for second, and in the surprise of the unlooked-for play he\nmade it by a spread-eagle slide.  It was a circus steal.\n\nDelaney snorted.  Then the look of profound disgust vanished in a flash\nof light.  His huge face beamed.\n\nReddie Ray was striding to the plate.\n\nThere was something about Reddie Ray that pleased all the senses.  His\nlithe form seemed instinct with life; any sudden movement was\nsuggestive of stored lightning.  His position at the plate was on the\nleft side, and he stood perfectly motionless, with just a hint of tense\nwaiting alertness.  Dorr, Blake and Babcock, the outfielders for the\nGrays, trotted round to the right of their usual position.  Delaney\nsmiled derisively, as if he knew how futile it was to tell what field\nReddie Ray might hit into.  Wehying, the old fox, warily eyed the\nyoungster, and threw him a high curve, close in.  It grazed Reddie's\nshirt, but he never moved a hair.  Then Wehying, after the manner of\nmany veteran pitchers when trying out a new and menacing batter, drove\na straight fast ball at Reddie's head.  Reddie ducked, neither too slow\nnor too quick, just right to show what an eye he had, how hard it was\nto pitch to.  The next was a strike.  And on the next he appeared to\nstep and swing in one action.  There was a ringing rap, and the ball\nshot toward right, curving down, a vicious, headed hit.  Mallory, at\nfirst base, snatched at it and found only the air.  Babcock had only\ntime to take a few sharp steps, and then he plunged down, blocked the\nhit and fought the twisting ball.  Reddie turned first base, flitted on\ntoward second, went headlong in the dust, and shot to the base before\nWhite got the throw-in from Babcock.  Then, as White wheeled and lined\nthe ball home to catch the scoring Clammer, Reddie Ray leaped up, got\nhis sprinter's start and, like a rocket, was off for third.  This time\nhe dove behind the base, sliding in a half circle, and as Hanley caught\nStrickland's perfect throw and whirled with the ball, Reddie's hand\nslid to the bag.\n\nReddie got to his feet amid a rather breathless silence.  Even the\ncoachers were quiet.  There was a moment of relaxation, then Wehying\nreceived the ball from Hanley and faced the batter.\n\nThis was Dump Kane.  There was a sign of some kind, almost\nimperceptible, between Kane and Reddie.  As Wehying half turned in his\nswing to pitch, Reddie Ray bounded homeward.  It was not so much the\nboldness of his action as the amazing swiftness of it that held the\naudience spellbound.  Like a thunderbolt Reddie came down the line,\nalmost beating Wehying's pitch to the plate.  But Kane's bat\nintercepted the ball, laying it down, and Reddie scored without\nsliding. Dorr, by sharp work, just managed to throw Kane out.\n\nThree runs so quick it was hard to tell how they had come.  Not in the\nmajor league could there have been faster work.  And the ball had been\nfielded perfectly and thrown perfectly.\n\n\"There you are,\" said Delaney, hoarsely. \"Can you beat it?  If you've\nbeen wonderin' how the cripped Stars won so many games just put what\nyou've seen in your pipe and smoke it.  Red Gilbat gets on--Reddy\nClammer gets on--and then Reddie Ray drives them home or chases them\nhome.\"\n\nThe game went on, and though it did not exactly drag it slowed down\nconsiderably.  Morrissey and Healy were retired on infield plays.  And\nthe sides changed.  For the Grays, O'Brien made a scratch hit, went to\nsecond on Strickland's sacrifice, stole third and scored on Mallory's\ninfield out.  Wehying missed three strikes.  In the Stars' turn the\nthree end players on the batting list were easily disposed of.  In the\nthird inning the clever Blake, aided by a base on balls and a hit\nfollowing, tied the score, and once more struck fire and brimstone from\nthe impatient bleachers.  Providence was a town that had to have its\nteam win.\n\n\"Git at 'em, Reds!\" said Delaney gruffly.\n\n\"Batter up!\" called Umpire Fuller, sharply.\n\n\"Where's Red?  Where's the bug?  Where's the nut?  Delaney, did you\nlock the gates?  Look under the bench!\"  These and other remarks, not\nexactly elegant, attested to the mental processes of some of the Stars.\nRed Gilbat did not appear to be forthcoming.  There was an anxious\ndelay Capt. Healy searched for the missing player. Delaney did not say\nany more.\n\nSuddenly a door under the grand stand opened and Red Gilbat appeared.\nHe hurried for his bat and then up to the plate.  And he never offered\nto hit one of the balls Wehying shot over.  When Fuller had called the\nthird strike Red hurried back to the door and disappeared.\n\n\"Somethin' doin',\" whispered Delaney.\n\nLord Chesterfield Clammer paraded to the batter's box and, after\ngradually surveying the field, as if picking out the exact place he\nmeant to drive the ball, he stepped to the plate.  Then a roar from the\nbleachers surprised him.\n\n\"Well, I'll be dog-goned!\" exclaimed Delaney. \"Red stole that sure as\nshootin'.\"\n\nRed Gilbat was pushing a brand-new baby carriage toward the batter's\nbox.  There was a tittering in the grand stand; another roar from the\nbleachers.  Clammer's face turned as red as his hair.  Gilbat shoved\nthe baby carriage upon the plate, spread wide his long arms, made a\nshort presentation speech and an elaborate bow, then backed away.\n\nAll eyes were centered on Clammer.  If he had taken it right the\nincident might have passed without undue hilarity.  But Clammer became\nabsolutely wild with rage.  It was well known that he was unmarried.\nEqually well was it seen that Gilbat had executed one of his famous\ntricks. Ball players were inclined to be dignified about the\npresentation of gifts upon the field, and Clammer, the dude, the swell,\nthe lady's man, the favorite of the baseball gods--in his own\nestimation--so far lost control of himself that he threw his bat at his\nretreating tormentor.  Red jumped high and the bat skipped along the\nground toward the bench.  The players sidestepped and leaped and, of\ncourse, the bat cracked one of Delaney's big shins.  His eyes popped\nwith pain, but he could not stop laughing.  One by one the players lay\ndown and rolled over and yelled.  The superior Clammer was not\noverliked by his co-players.\n\nFrom the grand stand floated the laughter of ladies and gentlemen.  And\nfrom the bleachers--that throne of the biting, ironic, scornful\nfans--pealed up a howl of delight.  It lasted for a full minute.  Then,\nas quiet ensued, some boy blew a blast of one of those infernal little\ninstruments of pipe and rubber balloon, and over the field wailed out a\nshrill, high-keyed cry, an excellent imitation of a baby.  Whereupon\nthe whole audience roared, and in discomfiture Reddy Clammer went in\nsearch of his bat.\n\nTo make his chagrin all the worse he ingloriously struck out.  And then\nhe strode away under the lea of the grand-stand wall toward right field.\n\nReddie Ray went to bat and, with the infield playing deep and the\noutfield swung still farther round to the right, he bunted a little\nteasing ball down the third-base line.  Like a flash of light he had\ncrossed first base before Hanley got his hands on the ball.  Then Kane\nhit into second base, forcing Reddie out.\n\nAgain the game assumed less spectacular and more ordinary play.  Both\nScott and Wehying held the batters safely and allowed no runs.  But in\nthe fifth inning, with the Stars at bat and two out, Red Gilbat again\nelectrified the field.  He sprang up from somewhere and walked to the\nplate, his long shape enfolded in a full-length linen duster.  The\ncolor and style of this garment might not have been especially\nstriking, but upon Red it had a weird and wonderful effect. Evidently\nRed intended to bat while arrayed in his long coat, for he stepped into\nthe box and faced the pitcher.  Capt. Healy yelled for him to take the\nduster off.  Likewise did the Grays yell.\n\nThe bleachers shrieked their disapproval.  To say the least, Red\nGilbat's crazy assurance was dampening to the ardor of the most blindly\nconfident fans.  At length Umpire Fuller waved his hand, enjoining\nsilence and calling time.\n\n\"Take it off or I'll fine you.\"\n\nFrom his lofty height Gilbat gazed down upon the little umpire, and it\nwas plain what he thought.\n\n\"What do I care for money!\" replied Red.\n\n\"That costs you twenty-five,\" said Fuller.\n\n\"Cigarette change!\" yelled Red.\n\n\"Costs you fifty.\"\n\n\"Bah!  Go to an eye doctor,\" roared Red.\n\n\"Seventy-five,\" added Fuller, imperturbably.\n\n\"Make it a hundred!\"\n\n\"It's two hundred.\"\n\n\"ROB-B-BER!\" bawled Red.\n\nFuller showed willingness to overlook Red's back talk as well as\ncostume, and he called, \"Play!\"\n\nThere was a mounting sensation of prophetic certainty.  Old fox Wehying\nappeared nervous. He wasted two balls on Red; then he put one over the\nplate, and then he wasted another.  Three balls and one strike!  That\nwas a bad place for a pitcher, and with Red Gilbat up it was worse.\nWehying swung longer and harder to get all his left behind the throw\nand let drive.  Red lunged and cracked the ball.  It went up and up and\nkept going up and farther out, and as the murmuring audience was slowly\ntransfixed into late realization the ball soared to its height and\ndropped beyond the left-field fence.  A home run!\n\nRed Gilbat gathered up the tails of his duster, after the manner of a\nneat woman crossing a muddy street, and ambled down to first base and\non to second, making prodigious jumps upon the bags, and round third,\nto come down the home-stretch wagging his red head.  Then he stood on\nthe plate, and, as if to exact revenge from the audience for the fun\nthey made of him, he threw back his shoulders and bellowed:  \"HAW!\nHAW! HAW!\"\n\nNot a handclap greeted him, but some mindless, exceedingly adventurous\nfan yelled:  \"Redhead! Redhead!  Redhead!\"\n\nThat was the one thing calculated to rouse Red Gilbat.  He seemed to\nflare, to bristle, and he paced for the bleachers.\n\nDelaney looked as if he might have a stroke. \"Grab him!  Soak him with\na bat!  Somebody grab him!\"\n\nBut none of the Stars was risking so much, and Gilbat, to the howling\nderision of the gleeful fans, reached the bleachers.  He stretched his\nlong arms up to the fence and prepared to vault over. \"Where's the guy\nwho called me redhead?\" he yelled.\n\nThat was heaping fuel on the fire.  From all over the bleachers, from\neverywhere, came the obnoxious word.  Red heaved himself over the fence\nand piled into the fans.  Then followed the roar of many voices, the\ntramping of many feet, the pressing forward of line after line of\nshirt-sleeved men and boys.  That bleacher stand suddenly assumed the\nmaelstrom appearance of a surging mob round an agitated center.  In a\nmoment all the players rushed down the field, and confusion reigned.\n\n\"Oh!  Oh!  Oh!\" moaned Delaney.\n\nHowever, the game had to go on.  Delaney, no doubt, felt all was over.\nNevertheless there were games occasionally that seemed an unending\nseries of unprecedented events.  This one had begun admirably to break\na record.  And the Providence fans, like all other fans, had cultivated\nan appetite as the game proceeded.  They were wild to put the other\nredheads out of the field or at least out for the inning, wild to tie\nthe score, wild to win and wilder than all for more excitement. Clammer\nhit safely.  But when Reddie Ray lined to the second baseman, Clammer,\nhaving taken a lead, was doubled up in the play.\n\nOf course, the sixth inning opened with the Stars playing only eight\nmen.  There was another delay.  Probably everybody except Delaney and\nperhaps Healy had forgotten the Stars were short a man.  Fuller called\ntime.  The impatient bleachers barked for action.\n\nCapt. White came over to Delaney and courteously offered to lend a\nplayer for the remaining innings.  Then a pompous individual came out\nof the door leading from the press boxes--he was a director Delaney\ndisliked.\n\n\"Guess you'd better let Fuller call the game,\" he said brusquely.\n\n\"If you want to--as the score stands now in our favor,\" replied Delaney.\n\n\"Not on your life!  It'll be ours or else we'll play it out and beat\nyou to death.\"\n\nHe departed in high dudgeon.\n\n\"Tell Reddie to swing over a little toward left,\" was Delaney's order\nto Healy.  Fire gleamed in the manager's eye.\n\nFuller called play then, with Reddy Clammer and Reddie Ray composing\nthe Star outfield.  And the Grays evidently prepared to do great\nexecution through the wide lanes thus opened up.  At that stage it\nwould not have been like matured ball players to try to crop hits down\ninto the infield.\n\nWhite sent a long fly back of Clammer.  Reddy had no time to loaf on\nthis hit.  It was all he could do to reach it and he made a splendid\ncatch, for which the crowd roundly applauded him.  That applause was\nwine to Reddy Clammer.  He began to prance on his toes and sing out to\nScott:  \"Make 'em hit to me, old man!  Make 'em hit to me!\" Whether\nScott desired that or not was scarcely possible to say; at any rate,\nHanley pounded a hit through the infield.  And Clammer, prancing high\nin the air like a check-reined horse, ran to intercept the ball.  He\ncould have received it in his hands, but that would never have served\nReddy Clammer.  He timed the hit to a nicety, went down with his old\ngrand-stand play and blocked the ball with his anatomy.  Delaney swore.\nAnd the bleachers, now warm toward the gallant outfielder, lustily\ncheered him.  Babcock hit down the right-field foul line, giving\nClammer a long run.  Hanley was scoring and Babcock was sprinting for\nthird base when Reddy got the ball. He had a fine arm and he made a\nhard and accurate throw, catching his man in a close play.\n\nPerhaps even Delaney could not have found any fault with that play.\nBut the aftermath spoiled the thing.  Clammer now rode the air; he\nsoared; he was in the clouds; it was his inning and he had utterly\nforgotten his team mates, except inasmuch as they were performing mere\nlittle automatic movements to direct the great machinery in his\ndirection for his sole achievement and glory.\n\nThere is fate in baseball as well as in other walks of life.  O'Brien\nwas a strapping fellow and he lifted another ball into Clammer's wide\nterritory.  The hit was of the high and far-away variety.  Clammer\nstarted to run with it, not like a grim outfielder, but like one\nthinking of himself, his style, his opportunity, his inevitable\nsuccess.  Certain it was that in thinking of himself the outfielder\nforgot his surroundings.  He ran across the foul line, head up, hair\nflying, unheeding the warning cry from Healy.  And, reaching up to make\nhis crowning circus play, he smashed face forward into the bleachers\nfence.  Then, limp as a rag, he dropped.  The audience sent forth a\nlong groan of sympathy.\n\n\"That wasn't one of his stage falls,\" said Delaney.  \"I'll bet he's\ndead....  Poor Reddy! And I want him to bust his face!\"\n\nClammer was carried off the field into the dressing room and a\nphysician was summoned out of the audience.\n\n\"Cap., what'd it--do to him?\" asked Delaney.\n\n\"Aw, spoiled his pretty mug, that's all,\" replied Healy, scornfully.\n\"Mebee he'll listen to me now.\"\n\nDelaney's change was characteristic of the man. \"Well, if it didn't\nkill him I'm blamed glad he got it....  Cap, we can trim 'em yet.\nReddie Ray'll play the whole outfield.  Give Reddie a chance to run!\nTell the boy to cut loose.  And all of you git in the game.  Win or\nlose, I won't forget it.  I've a hunch.  Once in a while I can tell\nwhat's comin' off.  Some queer game this!  And we're goin' to win.\nGilbat lost the game; Clammer throwed it away again, and now Reddie\nRay's due to win it....  I'm all in, but I wouldn't miss the finish\nto save my life.\"\n\nDelaney's deep presaging sense of baseball events was never put to a\ngreater test.  And the seven Stars, with the score tied, exhibited the\ntemper and timber of a championship team in the last ditch.  It was so\nsplendid that almost instantly it caught the antagonistic bleachers.\n\nWherever the tired Scott found renewed strength and speed was a\nmystery.  But he struck out the hard-hitting Providence catcher and\nthat made the third out.  The Stars could not score in their half of\nthe inning.  Likewise the seventh inning passed without a run for\neither side; only the infield work of the Stars was something superb.\nWhen the eighth inning ended, without a tally for either team, the\nexcitement grew tense. There was Reddy Ray playing outfield alone, and\nthe Grays with all their desperate endeavors had not lifted the ball\nout of the infield.\n\nBut in the ninth, Blake, the first man up, lined low toward right\ncenter.  The hit was safe and looked good for three bases.  No one\nlooking, however, had calculated on Reddie's Ray's fleetness. He\ncovered ground and dove for the bounding ball and knocked it down.\nBlake did not get beyond first base.  The crowd cheered the play\nequally with the prospect of a run.  Dorr bunted and beat the throw.\nWhite hit one of the high fast balls Scott was serving and sent it\nclose to the left-field foul line.  The running Reddie Ray made on that\nplay held White at second base.  But two runs had scored with no one\nout.\n\nHanley, the fourth left-handed hitter, came up and Scott pitched to him\nas he had to the others--high fast balls over the inside corner of the\nplate.  Reddy Ray's position was some fifty yards behind deep short,\nand a little toward center field. He stood sideways, facing two-thirds\nof that vacant outfield.  In spite of Scott's skill, Hanley swung the\nball far round into right field, but he hit it high, and almost before\nhe actually hit it the great sprinter was speeding across the green.\n\nThe suspense grew almost unbearable as the ball soared in its parabolic\nflight and the red-haired runner streaked dark across the green. The\nball seemed never to be coming down.  And when it began to descend and\nreached a point perhaps fifty feet above the ground there appeared more\ndistance between where it would alight and where Reddie was than\nanything human could cover.  It dropped and dropped, and then dropped\ninto Reddie Ray's outstretched hands.  He had made the catch look easy.\nBut the fact that White scored from second base on the play showed what\nthe catch really was.\n\nThere was no movement or restlessness of the audience such as usually\nindicated the beginning of the exodus.  Scott struck Babcock out.  The\ngame still had fire.  The Grays never let up a moment on their\ncoaching.  And the hoarse voices of the Stars were grimmer than ever.\nReddie Ray was the only one of the seven who kept silent. And he\ncrouched like a tiger.\n\nThe teams changed sides with the Grays three runs in the lead.\nMorrissey, for the Stars, opened with a clean drive to right.  Then\nHealy slashed a ground ball to Hanley and nearly knocked him down.\nWhen old Burns, by a hard rap to short, advanced the runners a base and\nmade a desperate, though unsuccessful, effort to reach first the\nProvidence crowd awoke to a strange and inspiring appreciation.  They\nbegan that most rare feature in baseball audiences--a strong and\ntrenchant call for the visiting team to win.\n\nThe play had gone fast and furious.  Wehying, sweaty and disheveled,\nworked violently.  All the Grays were on uneasy tiptoes.  And the Stars\nwere seven Indians on the warpath.  Halloran fouled down the\nright-field line; then he fouled over the left-field fence.  Wehying\ntried to make him too anxious, but it was in vain.  Halloran was\nimplacable.  With two strikes and three balls he hit straight down to\nwhite, and was out.  The ball had been so sharp that neither runner on\nbase had a chance to advance.\n\nTwo men out, two on base, Stars wanting three runs to tie, Scott, a\nweak batter, at the plate! The situation was disheartening.  Yet there\nsat Delaney, shot through and through with some vital compelling force.\nHe saw only victory.  And when the very first ball pitched to Scott hit\nhim on the leg, giving him his base, Delaney got to his feet, unsteady\nand hoarse.\n\nBases full, Reddie Ray up, three runs to tie!\n\nDelaney looked at Reddie.  And Reddie looked at Delaney.  The manager's\nface was pale, intent, with a little smile.  The player had eyes of\nfire, a lean, bulging jaw and the hands he reached for his bat clutched\nlike talons.\n\n\"Reddie, I knew it was waitin' for you,\" said Delaney, his voice\nringing.  \"Break up the game!\"\n\nAfter all this was only a baseball game, and perhaps from the fans'\nviewpoint a poor game at that.  But the moment when that lithe,\nredhaired athlete toed the plate was a beautiful one.  The long crash\nfrom the bleachers, the steady cheer from the grand stand, proved that\nit was not so much the game that mattered.\n\nWehying had shot his bolt; he was tired.  Yet he made ready for a final\neffort.  It seemed that passing Reddie Ray on balls would have been a\nwise play at that juncture.  But no pitcher, probably, would have done\nit with the bases crowded and chances, of course, against the batter.\n\nClean and swift, Reddie leaped at the first pitched ball.  Ping!  For a\nsecond no one saw the hit.  Then it gleamed, a terrific drive, low\nalong the ground, like a bounding bullet, straight at Babcock in right\nfield.  It struck his hands and glanced viciously away to roll toward\nthe fence.\n\nThunder broke loose from the stands.  Reddie Ray was turning first\nbase.  Beyond first base he got into his wonderful stride.  Some\nrunners run with a consistent speed, the best they can make for a given\ndistance.  But this trained sprinter gathered speed as he ran.  He was\nno short-stepping runner.  His strides were long.  They gave an\nimpression of strength combined with fleetness. He had the speed of a\nrace horse, but the trimness, the raciness, the delicate legs were not\ncharacteristic of him.  Like the wind he turned second, so powerful\nthat his turn was short.  All at once there came a difference in his\nrunning.  It was no longer beautiful.  The grace was gone.  It was now\nfierce, violent.  His momentum was running him off his legs.  He\nwhirled around third base and came hurtling down the homestretch. His\nface was convulsed, his eyes were wild.  His arms and legs worked in a\nmarvelous muscular velocity.  He seemed a demon--a flying streak. He\novertook and ran down the laboring Scott, who had almost reached the\nplate.\n\nThe park seemed full of shrill, piercing strife. It swelled, reached a\nhighest pitch, sustained that for a long moment, and then declined.\n\n\"My Gawd!\" exclaimed Delaney, as he fell back.  \"Wasn't that a finish?\nDidn't I tell you to watch them redheads!\"\n\n\n\nTHE RUBE\n\nIt was the most critical time I had yet experienced in my career as a\nbaseball manager. And there was more than the usual reason why I must\npull the team out.  A chance for a business deal depended upon the\ngood-will of the stockholders of the Worcester club.  On the outskirts\nof the town was a little cottage that I wanted to buy, and this\ndepended upon the business deal.  My whole future happiness depended\nupon the little girl I hoped to install in that cottage.\n\nComing to the Worcester Eastern League team, I had found a strong\naggregation and an enthusiastic following.  I really had a team with\npennant possibilities.  Providence was a strong rival, but I beat them\nthree straight in the opening series, set a fast pace, and likewise set\nWorcester baseball mad.  The Eastern League clubs were pretty evenly\nmatched; still I continued to hold the lead until misfortune overtook\nme.\n\nGregg smashed an umpire and had to be laid off.  Mullaney got spiked\nwhile sliding and was out of the game.  Ashwell sprained his ankle and\nHirsch broke a finger.  Radbourne, my great pitcher, hurt his arm on a\ncold day and he could not get up his old speed.  Stringer, who had\nbatted three hundred and seventy-one and led the league the year\nbefore, struck a bad spell and could not hit a barn door handed up to\nhim.\n\nThen came the slump.  The team suddenly let down; went to pieces;\nplayed ball that would have disgraced an amateur nine.  It was a trying\ntime. Here was a great team, strong everywhere.  A little hard luck had\ndug up a slump--and now! Day by day the team dropped in the race.  When\nwe reached the second division the newspapers flayed us.  Worcester\nwould never stand for a second division team.  Baseball admirers,\nreporters, fans--especially the fans--are fickle.  The admirers quit,\nthe reporters grilled us, and the fans, though they stuck to the games\nwith that barnacle-like tenacity peculiar to them, made life miserable\nfor all of us.  I saw the pennant slowly fading, and the successful\nseason, and the business deal, and the cottage, and Milly----\n\nBut when I thought of her I just could not see failure.  Something must\nbe done, but what?  I was at the end of my wits.  When Jersey City beat\nus that Saturday, eleven to two, shoving us down to fifth place with\nonly a few percentage points above the Fall River team, I grew\ndesperate, and locking my players in the dressing room I went after\nthem.  They had lain down on me and needed a jar.  I told them so\nstraight and flat, and being bitter, I did not pick and choose my words.\n\n\"And fellows,\" I concluded, \"you've got to brace.  A little more of\nthis and we can't pull out. I tell you you're a championship team.  We\nhad that pennant cinched.  A few cuts and sprains and hard luck--and\nyou all quit!  You lay down! I've been patient.  I've plugged for you.\nNever a man have I fined or thrown down.  But now I'm at the end of my\nstring.  I'm out to fine you now, and I'll release the first man who\nshows the least yellow.  I play no more substitutes. Crippled or not,\nyou guys have got to get in the game.\"\n\nI waited to catch my breath and expected some such outburst as managers\nusually get from criticized players.  But not a word!  Then I addressed\nsome of them personally.\n\n\"Gregg, your lay-off ends today.  You play Monday.  Mullaney, you've\ndrawn your salary for two weeks with that spiked foot.  If you can't\nrun on it--well, all right, but I put it up to your good faith.  I've\nplayed the game and I know it's hard to run on a sore foot.  But you\ncan do it. Ashwell, your ankle is lame, I know--now, can you run?\"\n\n\"Sure I can.  I'm not a quitter.  I'm ready to go in,\" replied Ashwell.\n\n\"Raddy, how about you?\" I said, turning to my star twirler.\n\n\"Connelly, I've seen as fast a team in as bad a rut and yet pull out,\"\nreturned Radbourne. \"We're about due for the brace.  When it\ncomes--look out!  As for me, well, my arm isn't right, but it's acting\nthese warm days in a way that tells me it will be soon.  It's been\nworked too hard. Can't you get another pitcher?  I'm not knocking Herne\nor Cairns.  They're good for their turn, but we need a new man to help\nout.  And he must be a crackerjack if we're to get back to the lead.\"\n\n\"Where on earth can I find such a pitcher?\" I shouted, almost\ndistracted.\n\n\"Well, that's up to you,\" replied Radbourne.\n\nUp to me it certainly was, and I cudgeled my brains for inspiration.\nAfter I had given up in hopelessness it came in the shape of a notice I\nread in one of the papers.  It was a brief mention of an amateur\nWorcester ball team being shut out in a game with a Rickettsville nine.\nRickettsville played Sunday ball, which gave me an opportunity to look\nthem over.\n\nIt took some train riding and then a journey by coach to get to\nRickettsville.  I mingled with the crowd of talking rustics.  There was\nonly one little \"bleachers\" and this was loaded to the danger point\nwith the feminine adherents of the teams.  Most of the crowd centered\nalongside and back of the catcher's box.  I edged in and got a position\njust behind the stone that served as home plate.\n\nHunting up a player in this way was no new thing to me.  I was too wise\nto make myself known before I had sized up the merits of my man.  So,\nbefore the players came upon the field I amused myself watching the\nrustic fans and listening to them.  Then a roar announced the\nappearance of the Rickettsville team and their opponents, who wore the\nname of Spatsburg on their Canton flannel shirts.  The uniforms of\nthese country amateurs would have put a Philadelphia Mummer's parade to\nthe blush, at least for bright colors.  But after one amused glance I\ngot down to the stern business of the day, and that was to discover a\npitcher, and failing that, baseball talent of any kind.\n\nNever shall I forget my first glimpse of the Rickettsville twirler.  He\nwas far over six feet tall and as lean as a fence rail.  He had a great\nshock of light hair, a sunburned, sharp-featured face, wide, sloping\nshoulders, and arms enormously long.  He was about as graceful and had\nabout as much of a baseball walk as a crippled cow.\n\n\"He's a rube!\" I ejaculated, in disgust and disappointment.\n\nBut when I had seen him throw one ball to his catcher I grew as keen as\na fox on a scent.  What speed he had!  I got round closer to him and\nwatched him with sharp, eager eyes.  He was a giant.  To be sure, he\nwas lean, rawboned as a horse, but powerful.  What won me at once was\nhis natural, easy swing.  He got the ball away with scarcely any\neffort.  I wondered what he could do when he brought the motion of his\nbody into play.\n\n\"Bub, what might be the pitcher's name?\" I asked of a boy.\n\n\"Huh, mister, his name might be Dennis, but it ain't.  Huh!\" replied\nthis country youngster. Evidently my question had thrown some\nimplication upon this particular player.\n\n\"I reckon you be a stranger in these parts,\" said a pleasant old\nfellow.  \"His name's Hurtle--Whitaker Hurtle.  Whit fer short.  He\nhain't lost a gol-darned game this summer.  No sir-ee! Never pitched\nany before, nuther.\"\n\nHurtle!  What a remarkably fitting name!\n\nRickettsville chose the field and the game began. Hurtle swung with his\neasy motion.  The ball shot across like a white bullet.  It was a\nstrike, and so was the next, and the one succeeding.  He could not\nthrow anything but strikes, and it seemed the Spatsburg players could\nnot make even a foul.\n\nOutside of Hurtle's work the game meant little to me.  And I was so\nfascinated by what I saw in him that I could hardly contain myself.\nAfter the first few innings I no longer tried to.  I yelled with the\nRickettsville rooters.  The man was a wonder.  A blind baseball manager\ncould have seen that.  He had a straight ball, shoulder high, level as\na stretched string, and fast.  He had a jump ball, which he evidently\nworked by putting on a little more steam, and it was the speediest\nthing I ever saw in the way of a shoot.  He had a wide-sweeping\noutcurve, wide as the blade of a mowing scythe.  And he had a drop--an\nunhittable drop.  He did not use it often, for it made his catcher dig\ntoo hard into the dirt.  But whenever he did I glowed all over.  Once\nor twice he used an underhand motion and sent in a ball that fairly\nswooped up.  It could not have been hit with a board.  And best of all,\ndearest to the manager's heart, he had control.  Every ball he threw\nwent over the plate.  He could not miss it.  To him that plate was as\nbig as a house.\n\nWhat a find!  Already I had visions of the long-looked-for brace of my\nteam, and of the pennant, and the little cottage, and the happy light\nof a pair of blue eyes.  What he meant to me, that country pitcher\nHurtle!  He shut out the Spatsburg team without a run or a hit or even\na scratch. Then I went after him.  I collared him and his manager, and\nthere, surrounded by the gaping players, I bought him and signed him\nbefore any of them knew exactly what I was about.  I did not haggle.  I\nasked the manager what he wanted and produced the cash; I asked Hurtle\nwhat he wanted, doubled his ridiculously modest demand, paid him in\nadvance, and got his name to the contract.  Then I breathed a long,\ndeep breath; the first one for weeks.  Something told me that with\nHurtle's signature in my pocket I had the Eastern League pennant.  Then\nI invited all concerned down to the Rickettsville hotel.\n\nWe made connections at the railroad junction and reached Worcester at\nmidnight in time for a good sleep.  I took the silent and backward\npitcher to my hotel.  In the morning we had breakfast together.  I\nshowed him about Worcester and then carried him off to the ball grounds.\n\nI had ordered morning practice, and as morning practice is not\nconducive to the cheerfulness of ball players, I wanted to reach the\ndressing room a little late.  When we arrived, all the players had\ndressed and were out on the field.  I had some difficulty in fitting\nHurtle with a uniform, and when I did get him dressed he resembled a\ntwo-legged giraffe decked out in white shirt, gray trousers and maroon\nstockings.\n\nSpears, my veteran first baseman and captain of the team, was the first\nto see us.\n\n\"Sufferin' umpires!\" yelled Spears.  \"Here, you Micks!  Look at this\nCon's got with him!\"\n\nWhat a yell burst from that sore and disgruntled bunch of ball tossers!\nMy players were a grouchy set in practice anyway, and today they were\nin their meanest mood.\n\n\"Hey, beanpole!\"\n\n\"Get on to the stilts!\"\n\n\"Con, where did you find that?\"\n\nI cut short their chaffing with a sharp order for batting practice.\n\n\"Regular line-up, now no monkey biz,\" I went on.  \"Take two cracks and\na bunt.  Here, Hurtle,\" I said, drawing him toward the pitcher's box,\n\"don't pay any attention to their talk.  That's only the fun of ball\nplayers.  Go in now and practice a little.  Lam a few over.\"\n\nHurtle's big freckled hands closed nervously over the ball.  I thought\nit best not to say more to him, for he had a rather wild look.  I\nremembered my own stage fright upon my first appearance in fast\ncompany.  Besides I knew what my amiable players would say to him.  I\nhad a secret hope and belief that presently they would yell upon the\nother side of the fence.\n\nMcCall, my speedy little left fielder, led off at bat.  He was full of\nginger, chipper as a squirrel, sarcastic as only a tried ball player\ncan be.\n\n\"Put 'em over, Slats, put 'em over,\" he called, viciously swinging his\nash.\n\nHurtle stood stiff and awkward in the box and seemed to be rolling\nsomething in his mouth. Then he moved his arm.  We all saw the ball\ndart down straight--that is, all of us except McCall, because if he had\nseen it he might have jumped out of the way.  Crack!  The ball hit him\non the shin.\n\nMcCall shrieked.  We all groaned.  That crack hurt all of us.  Any\nbaseball player knows how it hurts to be hit on the shinbone.  McCall\nwaved his bat madly.\n\n\"Rube!  Rube!  Rube!\" he yelled.\n\nThen and there Hurtle got the name that was to cling to him all his\nbaseball days.\n\nMcCall went back to the plate, red in the face, mad as a hornet, and he\nsidestepped every time Rube pitched a ball.  He never even ticked one\nand retired in disgust, limping and swearing. Ashwell was next.  He did\nnot show much alacrity. On Rube's first pitch down went Ashwell flat in\nthe dust.  The ball whipped the hair of his head.  Rube was wild and I\nbegan to get worried. Ashwell hit a couple of measly punks, but when he\nassayed a bunt the gang yelled derisively at him.\n\n\"What's he got?\"  The old familiar cry of batters when facing a new\npitcher!\n\nStringer went up, bold and formidable.  That was what made him the\ngreat hitter he was.  He loved to bat; he would have faced anybody; he\nwould have faced even a cannon.  New curves were a fascination to him.\nAnd speed for him, in his own words, was \"apple pie.\"  In this\ninstance, surprise was in store for Stringer.  Rube shot up the\nstraight one, then the wide curve, then the drop.  Stringer missed them\nall, struck out, fell down ignominiously.  It was the first time he had\nfanned that season and he looked dazed. We had to haul him away.\n\nI called off the practice, somewhat worried about Rube's showing, and\nundecided whether or not to try him in the game that day.  So I went to\nRadbourne, who had quietly watched Rube while on the field.  Raddy was\nan old pitcher and had seen the rise of a hundred stars.  I told him\nabout the game at Rickettsville and what I thought of Rube, and frankly\nasked his opinion.\n\n\"Con, you've made the find of your life,\" said Raddy, quietly and\ndeliberately.\n\nThis from Radbourne was not only comforting; it was relief, hope,\nassurance.  I avoided Spears, for it would hardly be possible for him\nto regard the Rube favorably, and I kept under cover until time to show\nup at the grounds.\n\nBuffalo was on the ticket for that afternoon, and the Bisons were\nleading the race and playing in topnotch form.  I went into the\ndressing room while the players were changing suits, because there was\na little unpleasantness that I wanted to spring on them before we got\non the field.\n\n\"Boys,\" I said, curtly, \"Hurtle works today. Cut loose, now, and back\nhim up.\"\n\nI had to grab a bat and pound on the wall to stop the uproar.\n\n\"Did you mutts hear what I said?  Well, it goes. Not a word, now.  I'm\nhandling this team.  We're in bad, I know, but it's my judgment to\npitch Hurtle, rube or no rube, and it's up to you to back us.  That's\nthe baseball of it.\"\n\nGrumbling and muttering, they passed out of the dressing room.  I knew\nball players.  If Hurtle should happen to show good form they would\nturn in a flash.  Rube tagged reluctantly in their rear.  He looked\nlike a man in a trance.  I wanted to speak encouragingly to him, but\nRaddy told me to keep quiet.\n\nIt was inspiring to see my team practice that afternoon.  There had\ncome a subtle change.  I foresaw one of those baseball climaxes that\ncan be felt and seen, but not explained.  Whether it was a hint of the\nhoped-for brace, or only another flash of form before the final\nlet-down, I had no means to tell.  But I was on edge.\n\nCarter, the umpire, called out the batteries, and I sent my team into\nthe field.  When that long, lanky, awkward rustic started for the\npitcher's box, I thought the bleachers would make him drop in his\ntracks.  The fans were sore on any one those days, and a new pitcher\nwas bound to hear from them.\n\n\"Where!  Oh, where!  Oh, where!\"\n\n\"Connelly's found another dead one!\"\n\n\"Scarecrow!\"\n\n\"Look at his pants!\"\n\n\"Pad his legs!\"\n\nThen the inning began, and things happened. Rube had marvelous speed,\nbut he could not find the plate.  He threw the ball the second he got\nit; he hit men, walked men, and fell all over himself trying to field\nbunts.  The crowd stormed and railed and hissed.  The Bisons pranced\nround the bases and yelled like Indians.  Finally they retired with\neight runs.\n\nEight runs!  Enough to win two games!  I could not have told how it\nhappened.  I was sick and all but crushed.  Still I had a blind, dogged\nfaith in the big rustic.  I believed he had not got started right.  It\nwas a trying situation.  I called Spears and Raddy to my side and\ntalked fast.\n\n\"It's all off now.  Let the dinged rube take his medicine,\" growled\nSpears.\n\n\"Don't take him out,\" said Raddy.  \"He's not shown at all what's in\nhim.  The blamed hayseed is up in the air.  He's crazy.  He doesn't\nknow what he's doing.  I tell you, Con, he may be scared to death, but\nhe's dead in earnest.\"\n\nSuddenly I recalled the advice of the pleasant old fellow at\nRickettsville.\n\n\"Spears, you're the captain,\" I said, sharply. \"Go after the rube.\nWake him up.  Tell him he can't pitch.  Call him 'Pogie!'  That's a\nname that stirs him up.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be dinged!  He looks it,\" replied Spears.  \"Here, Rube, get\noff the bench.  Come here.\"\n\nRube lurched toward us.  He seemed to be walking in his sleep.  His\nbreast was laboring and he was dripping with sweat.\n\n\"Who ever told you that you could pitch?\" asked Spears genially.  He\nwas master at baseball ridicule.  I had never yet seen the youngster\nwho could stand his badinage.  He said a few things, then wound up\nwith:  \"Come now, you cross between a hayrack and a wagon tongue, get\nsore and do something.  Pitch if you can.  Show us!  Do you hear, you\ntow-headed Pogie!\"\n\nRube jumped as if he had been struck.  His face flamed red and his\nlittle eyes turned black.  He shoved his big fist under Capt. Spears'\nnose.\n\n\"Mister, I'll lick you fer thet--after the game! And I'll show you\ndog-goned well how I can pitch.\"\n\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Raddy; and I echoed his word.  Then I went to the\nbench and turned my attention to the game.  Some one told me that\nMcCall had made a couple of fouls, and after waiting for two strikes\nand three balls had struck out.  Ashwell had beat out a bunt in his old\nswift style, and Stringer was walking up to the plate on the moment.\nIt was interesting, even in a losing game, to see Stringer go to bat.\nWe all watched him, as we had been watching him for weeks, expecting\nhim to break his slump with one of the drives that had made him famous.\nStringer stood to the left side of the plate, and I could see the bulge\nof his closely locked jaw.  He swung on the first pitched ball.  With\nthe solid rap we all rose to watch that hit.  The ball lined first,\nthen soared and did not begin to drop till it was far beyond the\nright-field fence.  For an instant we were all still, so were the\nbleachers.  Stringer had broken his slump with the longest drive ever\nmade on the grounds.  The crowd cheered as he trotted around the bases\nbehind Ashwell.  Two runs.\n\n\"Con, how'd you like that drive?\" he asked me, with a bright gleam in\nhis eyes.\n\n\"O-h-!--a beaut!\" I replied, incoherently.  The players on the bench\nwere all as glad as I was. Henley flew out to left.  Mullaney smashed a\ntwo-bagger to right.  Then Gregg hit safely, but Mullaney, in trying to\nscore on the play, was out at the plate.\n\n\"Four hits!  I tell you fellows, something's coming off,\" said Raddy.\n\"Now, if only Rube----\"\n\nWhat a difference there was in that long rustic! He stalked into the\nbox, unmindful of the hooting crowd and grimly faced Schultz, the first\nbatter up for the Bisons.  This time Rube was deliberate. And where he\nhad not swung before he now got his body and arm into full motion.  The\nball came in like a glint of light.  Schultz looked surprised.  The\numpire called \"Strike!\"\n\n\"Wow!\" yelled the Buffalo coacher.  Rube sped up the sidewheeler and\nSchultz reached wide to meet it and failed.  The third was the\nlightning drop, straight over the plate.  The batter poked weakly at\nit.  Then Carl struck out and Manning following, did likewise.  Three\nof the best hitters in the Eastern retired on nine strikes!  That was\nno fluke.  I knew what it meant, and I sat there hugging myself with\nthe hum of something joyous in my ears.\n\nGregg had a glow on his sweaty face.  \"Oh, but say, boys, take a tip\nfrom me!  The Rube's a world beater!  Raddy knew it; he sized up that\nswing, and now I know it.  Get wise, you its!\"\n\nWhen old Spears pasted a single through shortstop, the Buffalo manager\ntook Clary out of the box and put in Vane, their best pitcher.  Bogart\nadvanced the runner to second, but was thrown out on the play.  Then\nRube came up.  He swung a huge bat and loomed over the Bison's twirler.\nRube had the look of a hitter.  He seemed to be holding himself back\nfrom walking right into the ball.  And he hit one high and far away.\nThe fast Carl could not get under it, though he made a valiant effort.\nSpears scored and Rube's long strides carried him to third.  The cold\ncrowd in the stands came to life; even the sore bleachers opened up.\nMcCall dumped a slow teaser down the line, a hit that would easily have\nscored Rube, but he ran a little way, then stopped, tried to get back,\nand was easily touched out.  Ashwell's hard chance gave the Bison's\nshortstop an error, and Stringer came up with two men on bases.\nStringer hit a foul over the right-field fence and the crowd howled.\nThen he hit a hard long drive straight into the centerfielder's hands.\n\n\"Con, I don't know what to think, but ding me if we ain't hittin' the\nball,\" said Spears.  Then to his players:  \"A little more of that and\nwe're back in our old shape.  All in a minute--at 'em now!  Rube, you\ndinged old Pogie, pitch!\"\n\nRube toed the rubber, wrapped his long brown fingers round the ball,\nstepped out as he swung and--zing!  That inning he unloosed a few more\nkinks in his arm and he tried some new balls upon the Bisons.  But\nwhatever he used and wherever he put them the result was the same--they\ncut the plate and the Bisons were powerless.\n\nThat inning marked the change in my team. They had come hack.  The\nhoodoo had vanished. The championship Worcester team was itself again.\n\nThe Bisons were fighting, too, but Rube had them helpless.  When they\ndid hit a ball one of my infielders snapped it up.  No chances went to\nthe outfield.  I sat there listening to my men, and reveled in a moment\nthat I had long prayed for.\n\n\"Now you're pitching some, Rube.  Another strike!  Get him a board!\"\ncalled Ashwell.\n\n\"Ding 'em, Rube, ding 'em!\" came from Capt. Spears.\n\n\"Speed?  Oh-no!\" yelled Bogart at third base.\n\n\"It's all off, Rube!  It's all off--all off!\"\n\nSo, with the wonderful pitching of an angry rube, the Worcester team\ncame into its own again.  I sat through it all without another word;\nwithout giving a signal.  In a way I realized the awakening of the\nbleachers, and heard the pound of feet and the crash, but it was the\nspirit of my team that thrilled me.  Next to that the work of my new\nfind absorbed me.  I gloated over his easy, deceiving swing.  I rose\nout of my seat when he threw that straight fast ball, swift as a\nbullet, true as a plumb line.  And when those hard-hitting, sure\nbunting Bisons chopped in vain at the wonderful drop, I choked back a\nwild yell.  For Rube meant the world to me that day.\n\nIn the eighth the score was 8 to 6.  The Bisons had one scratch hit to\ntheir credit, but not a runner had got beyond first base.  Again Rube\nheld them safely, one man striking out, another fouling out, and the\nthird going out on a little fly.\n\nCrash!  Crash!  Crash!  Crash!  The bleachers were making up for many\ngames in which they could not express their riotous feelings.\n\n\"It's a cinch we'll win!\" yelled a fan with a voice.  Rube was the\nfirst man up in our half of the ninth and his big bat lammed the first\nball safe over second base.  The crowd, hungry for victory, got to\ntheir feet and stayed upon their feet, calling, cheering for runs.  It\nwas the moment for me to get in the game, and I leaped up, strung like\na wire, and white hot with inspiration. I sent Spears to the coaching\nbox with orders to make Rube run on the first ball.  I gripped McCall\nwith hands that made him wince.\n\nThen I dropped back on the bench spent and panting.  It was only a\ngame, yet it meant so much!  Little McCall was dark as a thunder cloud,\nand his fiery eyes snapped.  He was the fastest man in the league, and\ncould have bunted an arrow from a bow.  The foxy Bison third baseman\nedged in.  Mac feinted to bunt toward him then turned his bat inward\nand dumped a teasing curving ball down the first base line.  Rube ran\nas if in seven-league boots.  Mac's short legs twinkled; he went like\nthe wind; he leaped into first base with his long slide, and beat the\nthrow.\n\nThe stands and bleachers seemed to be tumbling down.  For a moment the\nair was full of deafening sound.  Then came the pause, the dying away\nof clatter and roar, the close waiting, suspended quiet.  Spears' clear\nvoice, as he coached Rube, in its keen note seemed inevitable of\nanother run.\n\nAshwell took his stand.  He was another left-hand hitter, and against a\nright-hand pitcher, in such circumstances as these, the most dangerous\nof men.  Vane knew it.  Ellis, the Bison captain knew it, as showed\nplainly in his signal to catch Rube at second.  But Spears' warning\nheld or frightened Rube on the bag.\n\nVane wasted a ball, then another.  Ashwell could not be coaxed.\nWearily Vane swung; the shortstop raced out to get in line for a\npossible hit through the wide space to his right, and the second\nbaseman got on his toes as both base runners started.\n\nCrack!  The old story of the hit and run game! Ashwell's hit crossed\nsharply where a moment before the shortstop had been standing.  With\ngigantic strides Rube rounded the corner and scored.  McCall flitted\nthrough second, and diving into third with a cloud of dust, got the\numpire's decision.  When Stringer hurried up with Mac on third and Ash\non first the whole field seemed racked in a deafening storm.  Again it\nsubsided quickly.  The hopes of the Worcester fans had been crushed too\noften of late for them to be fearless.\n\nBut I had no fear.  I only wanted the suspense ended.  I was like a man\nclamped in a vise. Stringer stood motionless.  Mac bent low with the\nsprinters' stoop; Ash watched the pitcher's arm and slowly edged off\nfirst.  Stringer waited for one strike and two balls, then he hit the\nnext.  It hugged the first base line, bounced fiercely past the bag and\nskipped over the grass to bump hard into the fence.  McCall romped\nhome, and lame Ashwell beat any run he ever made to the plate. Rolling,\nswelling, crashing roar of frenzied feet could not down the high\npiercing sustained yell of the fans.  It was great.  Three weeks of\nsubmerged bottled baseball joy exploded in one mad outburst!  The fans,\ntoo, had come into their own again.\n\nWe scored no more.  But the Bisons were beaten.  Their spirit was\nbroken.  This did not make the Rube let up in their last half inning.\nGrim and pale he faced them.  At every long step and swing he tossed\nhis shock of light hair.  At the end he was even stronger than at the\nbeginning. He still had the glancing, floating airy quality that\nbaseball players call speed.  And he struck out the last three batters.\n\nIn the tumult that burst over my ears I sat staring at the dots on my\nscore card.  Fourteen strike outs! one scratch hit!  No base on balls\nsince the first inning!  That told the story which deadened senses\ndoubted.  There was a roar in my ears.  Some one was pounding me.  As I\nstruggled to get into the dressing room the crowd mobbed me.  But I did\nnot hear what they yelled. I had a kind of misty veil before my eyes,\nin which I saw that lanky Rube magnified into a glorious figure.  I saw\nthe pennant waving, and the gleam of a white cottage through the trees,\nand a trim figure waiting at the gate.  Then I rolled into the dressing\nroom.\n\nSomehow it seemed strange to me.  Most of the players were stretched\nout in peculiar convulsions. Old Spears sat with drooping head.  Then a\nwild flaming-eyed giant swooped upon me.  With a voice of thunder he\nannounced:\n\n\"I'm a-goin' to lick you, too!\"\n\nAfter that we never called him any name except Rube.\n\n\n\nTHE RUBE'S PENNANT\n\n\"Fellows, it's this way.  You've got to win today's game.  It's the\nlast of the season and means the pennant for Worcester.  One more hard\nscrap and we're done!  Of all the up-hill fights any bunch ever made to\nland the flag, our has been the best.  You're the best team I ever\nmanaged, the gamest gang of ball players that ever stepped in spikes.\nWe've played in the hardest kind of luck all season, except that short\ntrip we called the Rube's Honeymoon.  We got a bad start, and sore arms\nand busted fingers, all kinds of injuries, every accident calculated to\nhurt a team's chances, came our way.  But in spite of it all we got the\nlead and we've held it, and today we're still a few points ahead of\nBuffalo.\"\n\nI paused to catch my breath, and looked round on the grim, tired faces\nof my players.  They made a stern group.  The close of the season found\nthem almost played out.  What a hard chance it was, after their\nextraordinary efforts, to bring the issue of the pennant down to this\nlast game!\n\n\"If we lose today, Buffalo, with three games more to play at home, will\npull the bunting,\" I went on.  \"But they're not going to win!  I'm\nputting it up to you that way.  I know Spears is all in; Raddy's arm is\ngone; Ash is playing on one leg; you're all crippled.  But you've got\none more game in you, I know.  These last few weeks the Rube has been\npitching out of turn and he's about all in, too.  He's kept us in the\nlead.  If he wins today it'll be Rube's Pennant.  But that might apply\nto all of you.  Now, shall we talk over the play today?  Any tricks to\npull off?  Any inside work?\"\n\n\"Con, you're pretty much upset an' nervous,\" replied Spears, soberly.\n\"It ain't no wonder. This has been one corker of a season.  I want to\nsuggest that you let me run the team today.  I've talked over the play\nwith the fellers.  We ain't goin' to lose this game, Con.  Buffalo has\nbeen comin' with a rush lately, an' they're confident. But we've been\nholdin' in, restin' up as much as we dared an' still keep our lead.\nMebbee it'll surprise you to know we've bet every dollar we could get\nhold of on this game.  Why, Buffalo money is everywhere.\"\n\n\"All right, Spears, I'll turn the team over to you.  We've got the\nbanner crowd of the year out there right now, a great crowd to play\nbefore. I'm more fussed up over this game than any I remember.  But I\nhave a sort of blind faith in my team....  I guess that's all I want\nto say.\"\n\nSpears led the silent players out of the dressing room and I followed;\nand while they began to toss balls to and fro, to limber up cold, dead\narms, I sat on the bench.\n\nThe Bisons were prancing about the diamond, and their swaggering\nassurance was not conducive to hope for the Worcesters.  I wondered how\nmany of that vast, noisy audience, intent on the day's sport, even had\na thought of what pain and toil it meant to my players.  The Buffalo\nmen were in good shape; they had been lucky; they were at the top of\ntheir stride, and that made all the difference.\n\nAt any rate, there were a few faithful little women in the grand\nstand--Milly and Nan and Rose Stringer and Kate Bogart--who sat with\ncompressed lips and hoped and prayed for that game to begin and end.\n\nThe gong called off the practice, and Spears, taking the field, yelled\ngruff encouragement to his men.  Umpire Carter brushed off the plate\nand tossed a white ball to Rube and called:  \"Play!\" The bleachers set\nup an exultant, satisfied shout and sat down to wait.\n\nSchultz toed the plate and watched the Rube pitch a couple.  There\nseemed to be no diminution of the great pitcher's speed and both balls\ncut the plate.  Schultz clipped the next one down the third-base Line.\nBogart trapped it close to the bag, and got it away underhand, beating\nthe speedy runner by a nose.  It was a pretty play to start with, and\nthe spectators were not close-mouthed in appreciation.  The short,\nstocky Carl ambled up to bat, and I heard him call the Rube something.\nIt was not a friendly contest, this deciding game between Buffalo and\nWorcester.\n\n\"Bing one close to his swelled nut!\" growled Spears to the Rube.\n\nCarl chopped a bouncing grounder through short and Ash was after it\nlike a tiger, but it was a hit.  The Buffalo contingent opened up.\nThen Manning faced the Rube, and he, too, vented sarcasm.  It might not\nhave been heard by the slow, imperturbable pitcher for all the notice\nhe took. Carl edged off first, slid back twice, got a third start, and\non the Rube's pitch was off for second base with the lead that always\nmade him dangerous. Manning swung vainly, and Gregg snapped a throw to\nMullaney.  Ball and runner got to the bag apparently simultaneously;\nthe umpire called Carl out, and the crowd uttered a quick roar of\ndelight.\n\nThe next pitch to Manning was a strike.  Rube was not wasting any\nballs, a point I noted with mingled fear and satisfaction.  For he\nmight have felt that he had no strength to spare that day and so could\nnot try to work the batters.  Again he swung, and Manning rapped a long\nline fly over McCall.  As the little left fielder turned at the sound\nof the hit and sprinted out, his lameness was certainly not in\nevidence.  He was the swiftest runner in the league and always when he\ngot going the crowd rose in wild clamor to watch him. Mac took that fly\nright off the foul flag in deep left, and the bleachers dinned their\npleasure.\n\nThe teams changed positions.  \"Fellers,\" said Spears, savagely, \"we may\nbe a bunged-up lot of stiffs, but, say!  We can hit!  If you love your\nold captain--sting the ball!\"\n\nVane, the Bison pitcher, surely had his work cut out for him.  For one\nsympathetic moment I saw his part through his eyes.  My Worcester\nveterans, long used to being under fire, were relentlessly bent on\ntaking that game.  It showed in many ways, particularly in their\nsilence, because they were seldom a silent team.  McCall hesitated a\nmoment over his bats.  Then, as he picked up the lightest one, I saw\nhis jaw set, and I knew he intended to bunt.  He was lame, yet he meant\nto beat out an infield hit.  He went up scowling.\n\nVane had an old head, and he had a varied assortment of balls.  For Mac\nhe used an under hand curve, rising at the plate and curving in to the\nleft-hander.  Mac stepped back and let it go.\n\n\"That's the place, Bo,\" cried the Buffalo infielders.  \"Keep 'em close\non the Crab.\"  Eager and fierce as McCall was, he let pitch after pitch\ngo by till he had three balls and two strikes.  Still the heady Vane\nsent up another pitch similar to the others.  Mac stepped forward in\nthe box, dropped his bat on the ball, and leaped down the line toward\nfirst base.  Vane came rushing in for the bunt, got it and threw.  But\nas the speeding ball neared the baseman, Mac stretched out into the air\nand shot for the bag.  By a fraction of a second he beat the ball.  It\nwas one of his demon-slides.  He knew that the chances favored his\nbeing crippled; we all knew that some day Mac would slide recklessly\nonce too often.  But that, too, is all in the game and in the spirit of\na great player.\n\n\"We're on,\" said Spears; \"now keep with him.\"\n\nBy that the captain meant that Mac would go down, and Ashwell would hit\nwith the run.\n\nWhen Vane pitched, little McCall was flitting toward second.  The Bison\nshortstop started for the bag, and Ash hit square through his tracks. A\nrolling cheer burst from the bleachers, and swelled till McCall overran\nthird base and was thrown back by the coacher.  Stringer hurried\nforward with his big bat.\n\n\"Oh!  My!\" yelled a fan, and he voiced my sentiments exactly.  Here we\nwould score, and be one run closer to that dearly bought pennant.\n\nHow well my men worked together!  As the pitcher let the ball go, Ash\nwas digging for second and Mac was shooting plateward.  They played on\nthe chance of Stringer's hitting. Stringer swung, the bat cracked, we\nheard a thud somewhere, and then Manning, half knocked over, was\nfumbling for the ball.  He had knocked down a terrific drive with his\nmitt, and he got the ball in time to put Stringer out.  But Mac scored\nand Ash drew a throw to third base and beat it.  He had a bad ankle,\nbut no one noticed it in that daring run.\n\n\"Watch me paste one!\" said Captain Spears, as he spat several yards.\nHe batted out a fly so long and high and far that, slow as he was, he\nhad nearly run to second base when Carl made the catch.  Ash easily\nscored on the throw-in.  Then Bogart sent one skipping over second, and\nTreadwell, scooping it on the run, completed a play that showed why he\nwas considered the star of the Bison infield.\n\n\"Two runs, fellers!\" said Spears.  \"That's some!  Push 'em over, Rube.\"\n\nThe second inning somewhat quickened the pace.  Even the Rube worked a\nlittle faster.  Ellis lined to Cairns in right; Treadwell fouled two\nballs and had a called strike, and was out; McKnight hit a low fly over\nshort, then Bud Wiler sent one between Spears and Mullaney.  Spears\nwent for it while the Rube with giant strides ran to cover first base.\nBetween them they got Bud, but it was only because he was heavy and\nslow on his feet.\n\nIn our half of that inning Mullaney, Gregg and Cairns went out in one,\ntwo, three order.\n\nWith Pannell up, I saw that the Rube held in on his speed, or else he\nwas tiring.  Pannell hit the second slow ball for two bases.  Vane\nsacrificed, and then the redoubtable Schultz came up. He appeared to be\nin no hurry to bat.  Then I saw that the foxy Buffalo players were\nworking to tire the Rube.  They had the situation figured. But they\nwere no wiser than old Spears.\n\n\"Make 'em hit, Rube.  Push 'em straight over. Never mind the corners.\nWe don't care for a few runs.  We'll hit this game out.\"\n\nShultz flied to Mac, who made a beautiful throw to the plate too late\nto catch Pannell.  Carl deliberately bunted to the right of the Rube\nand it cost the big pitcher strenuous effort to catch his man.\n\n\"We got the Rube waggin'!\" yelled a Buffalo player.\n\nManning tripled down the left foul line--a hit the bleachers called a\nscreamer.  When Ellis came up, it looked like a tie score, and when the\nRube pitched it was plain that he was tired.  The Bisons yelled their\nassurance of this and the audience settled into quiet.  Ellis batted a\nscorcher that looked good for a hit.  But the fast Ashwell was moving\nwith the ball, and he plunged lengthwise to get it square in his glove.\nThe hit had been so sharp that he had time to get up and make the throw\nto beat the runner.  The bleachers thundered at the play.\n\n\"You're up, Rube,\" called Spears.  \"Lam one out of the lot!\"\n\nThe Rube was an uncertain batter.  There was never any telling what he\nmight do, for he had spells of good and bad hitting.  But when he did\nget his bat on the ball it meant a chase for some fielder.  He went up\nswinging his huge club, and he hit a fly that would have been an easy\nhome run for a fast man.  But the best Rube could do was to reach third\nbase.  This was certainly good enough, as the bleachers loudly\nproclaimed, and another tally for us seemed sure.\n\nMcCall bunted toward third, another of his teasers.  The Rube would\nsurely have scored had he started with the ball, but he did not try and\nmissed a chance.  Wiler, of course, held the ball, and Mac got to first\nwithout special effort.  He went down on the first pitch.  Then Ash\nlined to Carl.  The Rube waited till the ball was caught and started\nfor home.  The crowd screamed, the Rube ran for all he was worth and\nCarl's throw to the plate shot in low and true.  Ellis blocked the Rube\nand tagged him out.\n\nIt looked to the bleachers as if Ellis had been unnecessarily rough,\nand they hissed and stormed disapproval.  As for me, I knew the Bisons\nwere losing no chance to wear out my pitcher.  Stringer fouled out with\nMac on third, and it made him so angry that he threw his bat toward the\nbench, making some of the boys skip lively.\n\nThe next three innings, as far as scoring was concerned, were all for\nBuffalo.  But the Worcester infield played magnificent ball, holding\ntheir opponents to one run each inning.\n\nThat made the score 4 to 2 in favor of Buffalo.\n\nIn the last half of the sixth, with Ash on first base and two men out,\nold Spears hit another of his lofty flies, and this one went over the\nfence and tied the score.  How the bleachers roared! It was full two\nminutes before they quieted down. To make it all the more exciting,\nBogart hit safely, ran like a deer to third on Mullaney's grounder,\nwhich Wiler knocked down, and scored on a passed ball.  Gregg ended the\ninning by striking out.\n\n\"Get at the Rube!\" boomed Ellis, the Bison captain.  \"We'll have him up\nin the air soon.  Get in the game now, you stickers!\"\n\nBefore I knew what had happened, the Bisons had again tied the score.\nThey were indomitable. They grew stronger all the time.  A stroke of\ngood luck now would clinch the game for them. The Rube was beginning to\nlabor in the box; Ashwell was limping; Spears looked as if he would\ndrop any moment; McCall could scarcely walk. But if the ball came his\nway he could still run. Nevertheless, I never saw any finer fielding\nthan these cripped players executed that inning.\n\n\"Ash--Mac--can you hold out?\" I asked, when they limped in.  I received\nglances of scorn for my question.  Spears, however, was not sanguine.\n\n\"I'll stick pretty much if somethin' doesn't happen,\" he said; \"but I'm\nall in.  I'll need a runner if I get to first this time.\"\n\nSpears lumbered down to first base on an infield hit and the heavy\nManning gave him the hip. Old Spears went down, and I for one knew he\nwas out in more ways than that signified by Carter's sharp:  \"Out!\"\n\nThe old war-horse gathered himself up slowly and painfully, and with\nhis arms folded and his jaw protruding, he limped toward the umpire.\n\n\"Did you call me out?\" he asked, in a voice plainly audible to any one\non the field.\n\n\"Yes,\" snapped Carter.\n\n\"What for?  I beat the ball, an' Mannin' played dirty with me--gave me\nthe hip.\"\n\n\"I called you out.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't out!\"\n\n\"Shut up now!  Get off the diamond!\" ordered Carter, peremptorily.\n\n\"What?  Me?  Say, I'm captain of this team. Can't I question a\ndecision?\"\n\n\"Not mine.  Spears, you're delaying the game.\"\n\n\"I tell you it was a rotten decision,\" yelled Spears.  The bleachers\nagreed with him.\n\nCarter grew red in the face.  He and Spears had before then met in\nfield squabbles, and he showed it.\n\n\"Fifty dollars!\"\n\n\"More!  You cheap-skate you piker!  More!\"\n\n\"It's a hundred!\"\n\n\"Put me out of the game!\" roared Spears.\n\n\"You bet!  Hurry now--skedaddle!\"\n\n\"Rob-b-ber!\" bawled Spears.\n\nThen he labored slowly toward the bench, all red, and yet with\nperspiration, his demeanor one of outraged dignity.  The great crowd,\nas one man, stood up and yelled hoarsely at Carter, and hissed and\nrailed at him.  When Spears got to the bench he sat down beside me as\nif in pain, but he was smiling.\n\n\"Con, I was all in, an' knowin' I couldn't play any longer, thought I'd\ntry to scare Carter.  Say, he was white in the face.  If we play into a\nclose decision now, he'll give it to us.\"\n\nBogart and Mullaney batted out in short order, and once more the\naggressive Bisons hurried in for their turn.  Spears sent Cairns to\nfirst base and Jones to right.  The Rube lobbed up his slow ball.  In\nthat tight pinch he showed his splendid nerve.  Two Buffalo players,\nover-anxious, popped up flies.  The Rube kept on pitching the slow\ncurve until it was hit safely.  Then heaving his shoulders with all his\nmight he got all the motion possible into his swing and let drive. He\nhad almost all of his old speed, but it hurt me to see him work with\nsuch desperate effort. He struck Wiler out.\n\nHe came stooping into the bench, apparently deaf to the stunning round\nof applause.  Every player on the team had a word for the Rube. There\nwas no quitting in that bunch, and if I ever saw victory on the stern\nfaces of ball players it was in that moment.\n\n\"We haven't opened up yet.  Mebbee this is the innin'.  If it ain't,\nthe next is,\" said Spears.\n\nWith the weak end of the batting list up, there seemed little hope of\ngetting a run on Vane that inning.  He had so much confidence that he\nput the ball over for Gregg, who hit out of the reach of the infield.\nAgain Vane sent up his straight ball, no doubt expecting Cairns to hit\ninto a double play.  But Cairns surprised Vane and everybody else by\npoking a safety past first base. The fans began to howl and pound and\nwhistle.\n\nThe Rube strode to bat.  The infield closed in for a bunt, but the Rube\nhad no orders for that style of play.  Spears had said nothing to him.\nVane lost his nonchalance and settled down.  He cut loose with all his\nspeed.  Rube stepped out, suddenly whirled, then tried to dodge, but\nthe ball hit him fair in the back.  Rube sagged in his tracks, then\nstraightened up, and walked slowly to first base.  Score 5 to 5, bases\nfull, no outs, McCall at bat.  I sat dumb on the bench, thrilling and\nshivering.  McCall!  Ashwell!  Stringer to bat!\n\n\"Play it safe!  Hold the bags!\" yelled the coacher.\n\nMcCall fairly spouted defiance as he faced Vane.\n\n\"Pitch!  It's all off!  An' you know it!\"\n\nIf Vane knew that, he showed no evidence of it.  His face was cold,\nunsmiling, rigid.  He had to pitch to McCall, the fastest man in the\nleague; to Ashwell, the best bunter; to Stringer, the champion batter.\nIt was a supreme test for a great pitcher.  There was only one kind of\na ball that McCall was not sure to hit, and that was a high curve, in\nclose.  Vane threw it with all his power. Carter called it a strike.\nAgain Vane swung and his arm fairly cracked.  Mac fouled the ball.  The\nthird was wide.  Slowly, with lifting breast, Vane got ready, whirled\nsavagely and shot up the ball. McCall struck out.\n\nAs the Buffalo players crowed and the audience groaned it was worthy of\nnote that little McCall showed no temper.  Yet he had failed to grasp a\ngreat opportunity.\n\n\"Ash, I couldn't see 'em,\" he said, as he passed to the bench.  \"Speed,\nwhew! look out for it. He's been savin' up.  Hit quick, an' you'll get\nhim.\"\n\nAshwell bent over the plate and glowered at Vane.\n\n\"Pitch!  It's all off!  An' you know it!\" he hissed, using Mac's words.\n\nAshwell, too, was left-handed; he, too, was extremely hard to pitch to;\nand if he had a weakness that any of us ever discovered, it was a slow\ncurve and change of pace.  But I doubted if Vane would dare to use slow\nballs to Ash at that critical moment.  I had yet to learn something of\nVane. He gave Ash a slow, wide-sweeping sidewheeler, that curved round\nover the plate.  Ash always took a strike, so this did not matter.\nThen Vane used his deceptive change of pace, sending up a curve that\njust missed Ash's bat as he swung.\n\n\"Oh!  A-h-h! hit!\" wailed the bleachers.\n\nVane doubled up like a contortionist, and shot up a lightning-swift\ndrop that fooled Ash completely.  Again the crowd groaned.  Score tied,\nbases full, two out, Stringer at bat!\n\n\"It's up to you, String,\" called Ash, stepping aside.\n\nStringer did not call out to Vane.  That was not his way.  He stood\ntense and alert, bat on his shoulder, his powerful form braced, and he\nwaited.  The outfielders trotted over toward right field, and the\ninfielders played deep, calling out warnings and encouragement to the\npitcher. Stringer had no weakness, and Vane knew this. Nevertheless he\ndid not manifest any uneasiness, and pitched the first ball without any\nextra motion.  Carter called it a strike.  I saw Stringer sink down\nslightly and grow tenser all over.  I believe that moment was longer\nfor me than for either the pitcher or the batter.  Vane took his time,\nwatched the base runners, feinted to throw to catch them, and then\ndelivered the ball toward the plate with the limit of his power.\n\nStringer hit the ball.  As long as I live, I will see that glancing low\nliner.  Shultz, by a wonderful play in deep center, blocked the ball\nand thereby saved it from being a home run.  But when Stringer stopped\non second base, all the runners had scored.\n\nA shrill, shrieking, high-pitched yell!  The bleachers threatened to\ndestroy the stands and also their throats in one long revel of baseball\nmadness.\n\nJones, batting in place of Spears, had gone up and fouled out before\nthe uproar had subsided.\n\n\"Fellers, I reckon I feel easier,\" said the Rube. It was the only time\nI had ever heard him speak to the players at such a stage.\n\n\"Only six batters, Rube,\" called out Spears. \"Boys, it's a grand game,\nan' it's our'n!\"\n\nThe Rube had enough that inning to dispose of the lower half of the\nBuffalo list without any alarming bids for a run.  And in our half,\nBogart and Mullaney hit vicious ground balls that gave Treadwell and\nWiler opportunities for superb plays.  Carl, likewise, made a beautiful\nrunning catch of Gregg's line fly.  The Bisons were still in the game,\nstill capable of pulling it out at the last moment.\n\nWhen Shultz stalked up to the plate I shut my eyes a moment, and so\nstill was it that the field and stands might have been empty.  Yet,\nthough I tried, I could not keep my eyes closed.  I opened them to\nwatch the Rube.  I knew Spears felt the same as I, for he was blowing\nlike a porpoise and muttering to himself:  \"Mebee the Rube won't last\nan' I've no one to put in!\"\n\nThe Rube pitched with heavy, violent effort. He had still enough speed\nto be dangerous.  But after the manner of ball players Shultz and the\ncoachers mocked him.\n\n\"Take all you can,\" called Ellis to Shultz.\n\nEvery pitch lessened the Rube's strength and these wise opponents knew\nit.  Likewise the Rube himself knew, and never had he shown better head\nwork than in this inning.  If he were to win, he must be quick.  So he\nwasted not a ball.  The first pitch and the second, delivered breast\nhigh and fairly over the plate, beautiful balls to hit, Shultz watched\nspeed by.  He swung hard on the third and the crippled Ashwell dove for\nit in a cloud of dust, got a hand in front of it, but uselessly, for\nthe hit was safe.  The crowd cheered that splendid effort.\n\nCarl marched to bat, and he swung his club over the plate as if he knew\nwhat to expect.  \"Come on, Rube!\" he shouted.  Wearily, doggedly, the\nRube whirled, and whipped his arm.  The ball had all his old glancing\nspeed and it was a strike. The Rube was making a tremendous effort.\nAgain he got his body in convulsive motion--two strikes!  Shultz had\nmade no move to run, nor had Carl made any move to hit.  These veterans\nwere waiting.  The Rube had pitched five strikes--could he last?\n\n\"Now, Carl!\" yelled Ellis, with startling suddenness, as the Rube\npitched again.\n\nCrack!  Carl placed that hit as safely through short as if he had\nthrown it.  McCall's little legs twinkled as he dashed over the grass.\nHe had to head off that hit and he ran like a streak.  Down and forward\nhe pitched, as if in one of his fierce slides, and he got his body in\nfront of the ball, blocking it, and then he rolled over and over.  But\nhe jumped up and lined the ball to Bogart, almost catching Shultz at\nthird-base.  Then, as Mac tried to walk, his lame leg buckled under\nhim, and down he went, and out.\n\n\"Call time,\" I called to Carter.  \"McCall is done....  Myers, you go\nto left an' for Lord's sake play ball!\"\n\nStringer and Bogart hurried to Mac and, lifting him up and supporting\nhim between them with his arms around their shoulders, they led him off\namid cheers from the stands.  Mac was white with pain.\n\n\"Naw, I won't go off the field.  Leave me on the bench,\" he said.\n\"Fight 'em now.  It's our game.  Never mind a couple of runs.\"\n\nThe boys ran back to their positions and Carter called play.  Perhaps a\nlittle delay had been helpful to the Rube.  Slowly he stepped into the\nbox and watched Shultz at third and Carl at second. There was not much\nprobability of his throwing to catch them off the base, but enough of a\npossibility to make them careful, so he held them close.\n\nThe Rube pitched a strike to Manning, then another.  That made eight\nstrikes square over the plate that inning.  What magnificent control!\nIt was equaled by the implacable patience of those veteran Bisons.\nManning hit the next ball as hard as Carl had hit his.  But Mullaney\nplunged down, came up with the ball, feinted to fool Carl, then let\ndrive to Gregg to catch the fleeting Shultz. The throw went wide, but\nGregg got it, and, leaping lengthwise, tagged Shultz out a yard from\nthe plate.\n\nOne out.  Two runners on bases.  The bleachers rose and split their\nthroats.  Would the inning never end?\n\nSpears kept telling himself:  \"They'll score, but we'll win.  It's our\ngame!\"\n\nI had a sickening fear that the strange confidence that obsessed the\nWorcester players had been blind, unreasoning vanity.\n\n\"Carl will steal,\" muttered Spears.  \"He can't be stopped.\"\n\nSpears had called the play.  The Rube tried to hold the little\nbase-stealer close to second, but, after one attempt, wisely turned to\nhis hard task of making the Bisons hit and hit quickly.  Ellis let the\nball pass; Gregg made a perfect throw to third; Bogart caught the ball\nand moved like a flash, but Carl slid under his hands to the bag.\nManning ran down to second.  The Rube pitched again, and this was his\ntenth ball over the plate. Even the Buffalo players evinced eloquent\nappreciation of the Rube's defence at this last stand.\n\nThen Ellis sent a clean hit to right, scoring both Carl and Manning.  I\nbreathed easier, for it seemed with those two runners in, the Rube had\na better chance.  Treadwell also took those two runners in, the Rube\nhad a way those Bisons waited.  They had their reward, for the Rube's\nspeed left him.  When he pitched again the ball had control, but no\nshoot.  Treadwell hit it with all his strength.  Like a huge cat\nAshwell pounced upon it, ran over second base, forcing Ellis, and his\nspeedy snap to first almost caught Treadwell.\n\nScore 8 to 7.  Two out.  Runner on first.  One run to tie.\n\nIn my hazy, dimmed vision I saw the Rube's pennant waving from the\nflag-pole.\n\n\"It's our game!\" howled Spears in my ear, for the noise from the stands\nwas deafening. \"It's our pennant!\"\n\nThe formidable batting strength of the Bisons had been met, not without\ndisaster, but without defeat.  McKnight came up for Buffalo and the\nRube took his weary swing.  The batter made a terrific lunge and hit\nthe ball with a solid crack It lined for center.\n\nSuddenly electrified into action, I leaped up. That hit!  It froze me\nwith horror.  It was a home-run.  I saw Stringer fly toward left\ncenter. He ran like something wild.  I saw the heavy Treadwell\nlumbering round the bases.  I saw Ashwell run out into center field.\n\n\"Ah-h!\"  The whole audience relieved its terror in that expulsion of\nsuspended breath. Stringer had leaped high to knock down the ball,\nsaving a sure home-run and the game.  He recovered himself, dashed back\nfor the ball and shot it to Ash.\n\nWhen Ash turned toward the plate, Treadwell was rounding third base.  A\ntie score appeared inevitable.  I saw Ash's arm whip and the ball shoot\nforward, leveled, glancing, beautiful in its flight.  The crowd saw it,\nand the silence broke to a yell that rose and rose as the ball sped in.\nThat yell swelled to a splitting shriek, and Treadwell slid in the\ndust, and the ball shot into Gregg's hands all at the same instant.\n\nCarter waved both arms upwards.  It was the umpire's action when his\ndecision went against the base-runner.  The audience rolled up one\ngreat stentorian cry.\n\n\"Out!\"\n\nI collapsed and sank back upon the bench.  My confused senses received\na dull roar of pounding feet and dinning voices as the herald of\nvictory. I felt myself thinking how pleased Milly would be. I had a\ndistinct picture in my mind of a white cottage on a hill, no longer a\ndream, but a reality, made possible for me by the Rube's winning of the\npennant.\n\n\n\nTHE RUBE'S HONEYMOON\n\n\"He's got a new manager.  Watch him pitch now!\"  That was what Nan\nBrown said to me about Rube Hurtle, my great pitcher, and I took it as\nher way of announcing her engagement.\n\nMy baseball career held some proud moments, but this one, wherein I\nrealized the success of my matchmaking plans, was certainly the\nproudest one.  So, entirely outside of the honest pleasure I got out of\nthe Rube's happiness, there was reason for me to congratulate myself.\nHe was a transformed man, so absolutely renewed, so wild with joy, that\non the strength of it, I decided the pennant for Worcester was a\nforegone conclusion, and, sure of the money promised me by the\ndirectors, Milly and I began to make plans for the cottage upon the\nhill.\n\nThe Rube insisted on pitching Monday's game against the Torontos, and\nalthough poor fielding gave them a couple of runs, they never had a\nchance.  They could not see the ball.  The Rube wrapped it around their\nnecks and between their wrists and straight over the plate with such\nincredible speed that they might just as well have tried to bat rifle\nbullets.\n\nThat night I was happy.  Spears, my veteran captain, was one huge\nsmile; Radbourne quietly assured me that all was over now but the\nshouting; all the boys were happy.\n\nAnd the Rube was the happiest of all.  At the hotel he burst out with\nhis exceeding good fortune.  He and Nan were to be married upon the\nFourth of July!\n\nAfter the noisy congratulations were over and the Rube had gone, Spears\nlooked at me and I looked at him.\n\n\"Con,\" said he soberly, \"we just can't let him get married on the\nFourth.\"\n\n\"Why not?  Sure we can.  We'll help him get married.  I tell you it'll\nsave the pennant for us. Look how he pitched today!  Nan Brown is our\nsalvation!\"\n\n\"See here, Con, you've got softenin' of the brain, too.  Where's your\nbaseball sense?  We've got a pennant to win.  By July Fourth we'll be\nclose to the lead again, an' there's that three weeks' trip on the\nroad, the longest an' hardest of the season.  We've just got to break\neven on that trip.  You know what that means.  If the Rube marries\nNan--what are we goin' to do?  We can't leave him behind.  If he takes\nNan with us--why it'll be a honeymoon!  An' half the gang is stuck on\nNan Brown!  An' Nan Brown would flirt in her bridal veil! ...  Why\nCon, we're up against a worse proposition than ever.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens! Cap.  You're right,\" I groaned.  \"I never thought of\nthat.  We've got to postpone the wedding....  How on earth can we?\nI've heard her tell Milly that.  She'll never consent to it.  Say,\nthis'll drive me to drink.\"\n\n\"All I got to say is this, Con.  If the Rube takes his wife on that\ntrip it's goin' to be an all-fired hummer.  Don't you forget that.\"\n\n\"I'm not likely to.  But, Spears, the point is this--will the Rube win\nhis games?\"\n\n\"Figurin' from his work today, I'd gamble he'll never lose another\ngame.  It ain't that.  I'm thinkin' of what the gang will do to him an'\nNan on the cars an' at the hotels.  Oh! Lord, Con, it ain't possible to\nstand for that honeymoon trip! Just think!\"\n\n\"If the worst comes to the worst, Cap, I don't care for anything but\nthe games.  If we get in the lead and stay there I'll stand for\nanything.... Couldn't the gang be coaxed or bought off to let the\nRube and Nan alone?\"\n\n\"Not on your life!  There ain't enough love or money on earth to stop\nthem.  It'll be awful. Mind, I'm not responsible.  Don't you go holdin'\nme responsible.  In all my years of baseball I never went on a trip\nwith a bride in the game. That's new on me, an' I never heard of it.\nI'd be bad enough if he wasn't a rube an' if she wasn't a crazy\ngirl-fan an' a flirt to boot, an' with half the boys in love with her,\nbut as it is----\"\n\nSpears gave up and, gravely shaking his head, he left me.  I spent a\nlittle while in sober reflection, and finally came to the conclusion\nthat, in my desperate ambition to win the pennant, I would have taken\nhalf a dozen rube pitchers and their baseball-made brides on the trip,\nif by so doing I could increase the percentage of games won.\nNevertheless, I wanted to postpone the Rube's wedding if it was\npossible, and I went out to see Milly and asked her to help us.  But\nfor once in her life Milly turned traitor.\n\n\"Connie, you don't want to postpone it.  Why, how perfectly lovely! ...\nMrs. Stringer will go on that trip and Mrs. Bogart....  Connie,\nI'm going too!\"\n\nShe actually jumped up and down in glee.  That was the woman in her.\nIt takes a wedding to get a woman.  I remonstrated and pleaded and\ncommanded, all to no purpose.  Milly intended to go on that trip to see\nthe games, and the fun, and the honeymoon.\n\nShe coaxed so hard that I yielded.  Thereupon she called up Mrs.\nStringer on the telephone, and of course found that young woman just as\neager as she was.  For my part, I threw anxiety and care to the four\nwinds, and decided to be as happy as any of them.  The pennant was\nmine!  Something kept ringing that in my ears.  With the Rube working\nhis iron arm for the edification of his proud Nancy Brown, there was\nextreme likelihood of divers shut-outs and humiliating defeats for some\nEastern League teams.\n\nHow well I calculated became a matter of baseball history during that\nlast week of June.  We won six straight games, three of which fell to\nthe Rube's credit.  His opponents scored four runs in the three games,\nagainst the nineteen we made. Upon July 1, Radbourne beat Providence\nand Cairns won the second game.  We now had a string of eight\nvictories.  Sunday we rested, and Monday was the Fourth, with morning\nand afternoon games with Buffalo.\n\nUpon the morning of the Fourth, I looked for the Rube at the hotel, but\ncould not find him.  He did not show up at the grounds when the other\nboys did, and I began to worry.  It was the Rube's turn to pitch and we\nwere neck and neck with Buffalo for first place.  If we won both games\nwe would go ahead of our rivals.  So I was all on edge, and kept going\nto the dressing-room to see if the Rube had arrived.  He came, finally,\nwhen all the boys were dressed, and about to go out for practice.  He\nhad on a new suit, a tailor-made suit at that, and he looked fine.\nThere was about him a kind of strange radiance.  He stated simply that\nhe had arrived late because he had just been married.  Before\ncongratulations were out of our mouths, he turned to me.\n\n\"Con, I want to pitch both games today,\" he said.\n\n\"What!  Say, Whit, Buffalo is on the card today and we are only three\npoints behind them. If we win both we'll be leading the league once\nmore.  I don't know about pitching you both games.\"\n\n\"I reckon we'll be in the lead tonight then,\" he replied, \"for I'll win\nthem both.\"\n\nI was about to reply when Dave, the ground-keeper, called me to the\ndoor, saying there was a man to see me.  I went out, and there stood\nMorrisey, manager of the Chicago American League team.  We knew each\nother well and exchanged greetings.\n\n\"Con, I dropped off to see you about this new pitcher of yours, the one\nthey call the Rube.  I want to see him work.  I've heard he's pretty\nfast.  How about it?\"\n\n\"Wait--till you see him pitch,\" I replied.  I could scarcely get that\nmuch out, for Morrisey's presence meant a great deal and I did not want\nto betray my elation.\n\n\"Any strings on him?\" queried the big league manager, sharply.\n\n\"Well, Morrisey, not exactly.  I can give you the first call.  You'll\nhave to bid high, though. Just wait till you see him work.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that.  My scout was over here watching him pitch and\nsays he's a wonder.\"\n\nWhat luck it was that Morrisey should have come upon this day!  I could\nhardly contain myself. Almost I began to spend the money I would get\nfor selling the Rube to the big league manager. We took seats in the\ngrand stand, as Morrisey did not want to be seen by any players, and I\nstayed there with him until the gong sounded. There was a big\nattendance.  I looked all over the stand for Nan, but she was lost in\nthe gay crowd.  But when I went down to the bench I saw her up in my\nprivate box with Milly.  It took no second glance to see that Nan Brown\nwas a bride and glorying in the fact.\n\nThen, in the absorption of the game, I became oblivious to Milly and\nNan; the noisy crowd; the giant fire-crackers and the smoke; to the\npresence of Morrisey; to all except the Rube and my team and their\nopponents.  Fortunately for my hopes, the game opened with\ncharacteristic Worcester dash.  Little McCall doubled, Ashwell drew his\nbase on four wide pitches, and Stringer drove the ball over the\nright-field fence--three runs!\n\nThree runs were enough to win that game.  Of all the exhibitions of\npitching with which the Rube had favored us, this one was the finest.\nIt was perhaps not so much his marvelous speed and unhittable curves\nthat made the game one memorable in the annals of pitching; it was his\nperfect control in the placing of balls, in the cutting of corners; in\nhis absolute implacable mastery of the situation.  Buffalo was unable\nto find him at all.  The game was swift short, decisive, with the score\n5 to 0 in our favor.  But the score did not tell all of the Rube's work\nthat morning.  He shut out Buffalo without a hit, or a scratch, the\nfirst no-hit, no-run game of the year.  He gave no base on balls; not a\nBuffalo player got to first base; only one fly went to the outfield.\n\nFor once I forgot Milly after a game, and I hurried to find Morrisey,\nand carried him off to have dinner with me.\n\n\"Your rube is a wonder, and that's a fact,\" he said to me several\ntimes.  \"Where on earth did you get him?  Connelly, he's my meat.  Do\nyou understand?  Can you let me have him right now?\"\n\n\"No, Morrisey, I've got the pennant to win first.  Then I'll sell him.\"\n\n\"How much?  Do you hear?  How much?\" Morrisey hammered the table with\nhis fist and his eyes gleamed.\n\nCarried away as I was by his vehemence, I was yet able to calculate\nshrewdly, and I decided to name a very high price, from which I could\ncome down and still make a splendid deal.\n\n\"How much?\" demanded Morrisey.\n\n\"Five thousand dollars,\" I replied, and gulped when I got the words out.\n\nMorrisey never batted an eye.\n\n\"Waiter, quick, pen and ink and paper!\"\n\nPresently my hand, none too firm, was signing my name to a contract\nwhereby I was to sell my pitcher for five thousand dollars at the close\nof the current season.  I never saw a man look so pleased as Morrisey\nwhen he folded that contract and put it in his pocket.  He bade me\ngood-bye and hurried off to catch a train, and he never knew the Rube\nhad pitched the great game on his wedding day.\n\nThat afternoon before a crowd that had to be roped off the diamond, I\nput the Rube against the Bisons.  How well he showed the baseball\nknowledge he had assimilated!  He changed his style in that second\ngame.  He used a slow ball and wide curves and took things easy.  He\nmade Buffalo hit the ball and when runners got on bases once more let\nout his speed and held them down.  He relied upon the players behind\nhim and they were equal to the occasion.\n\nIt was a totally different game from that of the morning, and perhaps\none more suited to the pleasure of the audience.  There was plenty of\nhard hitting, sharp fielding and good base running, and the game was\nclose and exciting up to the eighth, when Mullaney's triple gave us two\nruns, and a lead that was not headed.  To the deafening roar of the\nbleachers the Rube walked off the field, having pitched Worcester into\nfirst place in the pennant race.\n\nThat night the boys planned their first job on the Rube.  We had\nordered a special Pullman for travel to Toronto, and when I got to the\ndepot in the morning, the Pullman was a white fluttering mass of satin\nribbons.  Also, there was a brass band, and thousands of baseball fans,\nand barrels of old foot-gear.  The Rube and Nan arrived in a cab and\nwere immediately mobbed. The crowd roared, the band played, the engine\nwhistled, the bell clanged; and the air was full of confetti and\nslippers, and showers of rice like hail pattered everywhere.  A\nsomewhat dishevelled bride and groom boarded the Pullman and\nbreathlessly hid in a state room.  The train started, and the crowd\ngave one last rousing cheer.  Old Spears yelled from the back platform:\n\n\"Fellers, an' fans, you needn't worry none about leavin' the Rube an'\nhis bride to the tender mercies of the gang.  A hundred years from now\npeople will talk about this honeymoon baseball trip.  Wait till we come\nback--an' say, jest to put you wise, no matter what else happens, we're\ncomin' back in first place!\"\n\nIt was surely a merry party in that Pullman. The bridal couple emerged\nfrom their hiding place and held a sort of reception in which the Rube\nappeared shy and frightened, and Nan resembled a joyous, fluttering\nbird in gray.  I did not see if she kissed every man on the team, but\nshe kissed me as if she had been wanting to do it for ages. Milly\nkissed the Rube, and so did the other women, to his infinite\nembarrassment.  Nan's effect upon that crowd was most singular.  She\nwas sweetness and caprice and joy personified.\n\nWe settled down presently to something approaching order, and I, for\none, with very keen ears and alert eyes, because I did not want to miss\nanything.\n\n\"I see the lambs a-gambolin',\" observed McCall, in a voice louder than\nwas necessary to convey his meaning to Mullaney, his partner in the\nseat.\n\n\"Yes, it do seem as if there was joy aboundin' hereabouts,\" replied Mul\nwith fervor.\n\n\"It's more spring-time than summer,\" said Ashwell, \"an' everything in\nnature is runnin' in pairs.  There are the sheep an' the cattle an' the\nbirds.  I see two kingfishers fishin' over here. An' there's a couple\nof honey-bees makin' honey. Oh, honey, an' by George, if there ain't\ntwo butterflies foldin' their wings round each other.  See the\ndandelions kissin' in the field!\"\n\nThen the staid Captain Spears spoke up with an appearance of sincerity\nand a tone that was nothing short of remarkable.\n\n\"Reggie, see the sunshine asleep upon yon bank.  Ain't it lovely?  An'\nthat white cloud sailin' thither amid the blue--how spontaneous! Joy is\na-broad o'er all this boo-tiful land today--Oh, yes!  An' love's wings\nhover o 'er the little lambs an' the bullfrogs in the pond an' the\ndicky birds in the trees.  What sweetness to lie in the grass, the lap\nof bounteous earth, eatin' apples in the Garden of Eden, an' chasin'\naway the snakes an' dreamin' of Thee, Sweet-h-e-a-r-t----\"\n\nSpears was singing when he got so far and there was no telling what he\nmight have done if Mullaney, unable to stand the agony, had not jabbed\na pin in him.  But that only made way for the efforts of the other\nboys, each of whom tried to outdo the other in poking fun at the Rube\nand Nan.  The big pitcher was too gloriously happy to note much of what\nwent on around him, but when it dawned upon him he grew red and white\nby turns.\n\nNan, however, was more than equal to the occasion.  Presently she\nsmiled at Spears, such a smile!  The captain looked as if he had just\npartaken of an intoxicating wine.  With a heightened color in her\ncheeks and a dangerous flash in her roguish eyes, Nan favored McCall\nwith a look, which was as much as to say that she remembered him with a\ndear sadness.  She made eyes at every fellow in the car, and then\nbringing back her gaze to the Rube, as if glorying in comparison, she\nnestled her curly black head on his shoulder.  He gently tried to move\nher; but it was not possible. Nan knew how to meet the ridicule of half\na dozen old lovers.  One by one they buried themselves in newspapers,\nand finally McCall, for once utterly beaten, showed a white feather,\nand sank back out of sight behind his seat.\n\nThe boys did not recover from that shock until late in the afternoon.\nAs it was a physical impossibility for Nan to rest her head all day\nupon her husband's broad shoulder, the boys toward dinner time came out\nof their jealous trance.  I heard them plotting something.  When dinner\nwas called, about half of my party, including the bride and groom, went\nat once into the dining-car. Time there flew by swiftly.  And later,\nwhen we were once more in our Pullman, and I had gotten interested in a\ngame of cards with Milly and Stringer and his wife, the Rube came\nmarching up to me with a very red face.\n\n\"Con, I reckon some of the boys have stolen my--our grips,\" said he.\n\n\"What?\" I asked, blankly.\n\nHe explained that during his absence in the dining-car someone had\nentered his stateroom and stolen his grip and Nan's.  I hastened at\nonce to aid the Rube in his search.  The boys swore by everything under\nand beyond the sun they had not seen the grips; they appeared very much\ngrieved at the loss and pretended to help in searching the Pullman.  At\nlast, with the assistance of a porter, we discovered the missing grips\nin an upper berth.  The Rube carried them off to his stateroom and we\nknew soon from his uncomplimentary remarks that the contents of the\nsuitcases had been mixed and manhandled.  But he did not hunt for the\njokers.\n\nWe arrived at Toronto before daylight next morning, and remained in the\nPullman until seven o'clock.  When we got out, it was discovered that\nthe Rube and Nan had stolen a march upon us. We traced them to the\nhotel, and found them at breakfast.  After breakfast we formed a merry\nsight-seeing party and rode all over the city.\n\nThat afternoon, when Raddy let Toronto down with three hits and the\nboys played a magnificent game behind him, and we won 7 to 2, I knew at\nlast and for certain that the Worcester team had come into its own\nagain.  Then next day Cairns won a close, exciting game, and following\nthat, on the third day, the matchless Rube toyed with the Torontos.\nEleven straight games won!  I was in the clouds, and never had I seen\nso beautiful a light as shone in Milly's eyes.\n\nFrom that day The Honeymoon Trip of the Worcester Baseball Club, as the\nnewspapers heralded it--was a triumphant march.  We won two out of\nthree games at Montreal, broke even with the hard-fighting Bisons, took\nthree straight from Rochester, and won one and tied one out of three\nwith Hartford.  It would have been wonderful ball playing for a team to\nplay on home grounds and we were doing the full circuit of the league.\n\nSpears had called the turn when he said the trip would be a hummer.\nNan Hurtle had brought us wonderful luck.\n\nBut the tricks they played on Whit and his girl-fan bride!\n\nAshwell, who was a capital actor, disguised himself as a conductor and\npretended to try to eject Whit and Nan from the train, urging that\nlove-making was not permitted.  Some of the team hired a clever young\nwoman to hunt the Rube up at the hotel, and claim old acquaintance with\nhim.  Poor Whit almost collapsed when the young woman threw her arms\nabout his neck just as Nan entered the parlor.  Upon the instant Nan\nbecame wild as a little tigress, and it took much explanation and\neloquence to reinstate Whit in her affections.\n\nAnother time Spears, the wily old fox, succeeded in detaining Nan on\nthe way to the station, and the two missed the train.  At first the\nRube laughed with the others, but when Stringer remarked that he had\nnoticed a growing attachment between Nan and Spears, my great pitcher\nexperienced the first pangs of the green-eyed monster.  We had to hold\nhim to keep him from jumping from the train, and it took Milly and Mrs.\nStringer to soothe him.  I had to wire back to Rochester for a special\ntrain for Spears and Nan, and even then we had to play half a game\nwithout the services of our captain.\n\nSo far upon our trip I had been fortunate in securing comfortable rooms\nand the best of transportation for my party.  At Hartford, however, I\nencountered difficulties.  I could not get a special Pullman, and the\nsleeper we entered already had a number of occupants.  After the ladies\nof my party had been assigned to berths, it was necessary for some of\nthe boys to sleep double in upper berths.\n\nIt was late when we got aboard, the berths were already made up, and\nsoon we had all retired. In the morning very early I was awakened by a\ndisturbance.  It sounded like a squeal.  I heard an astonished\nexclamation, another squeal, the pattering of little feet, then hoarse\nuproar of laughter from the ball players in the upper berths. Following\nthat came low, excited conversation between the porter and somebody,\nthen an angry snort from the Rube and the thud of his heavy feet in the\naisle.  What took place after that was guess-work for me.  But I\ngathered from the roars and bawls that the Rube was after some of the\nboys.  I poked my head between the curtains and saw him digging into\nthe berths.\n\n\"Where's McCall?\" he yelled.\n\nMac was nowhere in that sleeper, judging from the vehement denials.\nBut the Rube kept on digging and prodding in the upper berths.\n\n\"I'm a-goin' to lick you, Mac, so I reckon you'd better show up,\"\nshouted the Rube.\n\nThe big fellow was mad as a hornet.  When he got to me he grasped me\nwith his great fence-rail splitting hands and I cried out with pain.\n\n\"Say!  Whit, let up!  Mac's not here.... What's wrong?\"\n\n\"I'll show you when I find him.\"  And the Rube stalked on down the\naisle, a tragically comic figure in his pajamas.  In his search for Mac\nhe pried into several upper berths that contained occupants who were\nnot ball players, and these protested in affright.  Then the Rube began\nto investigate the lower berths.  A row of heads protruded in a bobbing\nline from between the curtains of the upper berths.\n\n\"Here, you Indian!  Don't you look in there! That's my wife's berth!\"\nyelled Stringer.\n\nBogart, too, evinced great excitement.\n\n\"Hurtle, keep out of lower eight or I'll kill you,\" he shouted.\n\nWhat the Rube might have done there was no telling, but as he grasped a\ncurtain, he was interrupted by a shriek from some woman assuredly not\nof our party.\n\n\"Get out! you horrid wretch!  Help!  Porter! Help!  Conductor!\"\n\nInstantly there was a deafening tumult in the car.  When it had\nsubsided somewhat, and I considered I would be safe, I descended from\nmy berth and made my way to the dressing room. Sprawled over the\nleather seat was the Rube pommelling McCall with hearty good will.  I\nwould have interfered, had it not been for Mac's demeanor.  He was half\nfrightened, half angry, and utterly unable to defend himself or even\nresist, because he was laughing, too.\n\n\"Dog-gone it!  Whit--I didn't--do it!  I swear it was Spears!  Stop\nthumpin' me now--or I'll get sore....  You hear me!  It wasn't me, I\ntell you.  Cheese it!\"\n\nFor all his protesting Mac received a good thumping, and I doubted not\nin the least that he deserved it.  The wonder of the affair, however,\nwas the fact that no one appeared to know what had made the Rube so\nfurious.  The porter would not tell, and Mac was strangely reticent,\nthough his smile was one to make a fellow exceedingly sure something\nout of the ordinary had befallen. It was not until I was having\nbreakfast in Providence that I learned the true cause of Rube's\nconduct, and Milly confided it to me, insisting on strict confidence.\n\n\"I promised not to tell,\" she said.  \"Now you promise you'll never\ntell.\"\n\n\"Well, Connie,\" went on Milly, when I had promised, \"it was the\nfunniest thing yet, but it was horrid of McCall.  You see, the Rube had\nupper seven and Nan had lower seven.  Early this morning, about\ndaylight, Nan awoke very thirsty and got up to get a drink.  During her\nabsence, probably, but any way some time last night, McCall changed the\nnumber on her curtain, and when Nan came back to number seven of course\nshe almost got in the wrong berth.\"\n\n\"No wonder the Rube punched him!\" I declared. \"I wish we were safe\nhome.  Something'll happen yet on this trip.\"\n\nI was faithful to my promise to Milly, but the secret leaked out\nsomewhere; perhaps Mac told it, and before the game that day all the\nplayers knew it.  The Rube, having recovered his good humor, minded it\nnot in the least.  He could not have felt ill-will for any length of\ntime.  Everything seemed to get back into smooth running order, and the\nHoneymoon Trip bade fair to wind up beautifully.\n\nBut, somehow or other, and about something unknown to the rest of us,\nthe Rube and Nan quarreled.  It was their first quarrel.  Milly and I\ntried to patch it up but failed.\n\nWe lost the first game to Providence and won the second.  The next day,\na Saturday, was the last game of the trip, and it was Rube's turn to\npitch.  Several times during the first two days the Rube and Nan about\nhalf made up their quarrel, only in the end to fall deeper into it.\nThen the last straw came in a foolish move on the part of wilful Nan.\nShe happened to meet Henderson, her former admirer, and in a flash she\ntook up her flirtation with him where she had left off.\n\n\"Don't go to the game with him, Nan,\" I pleaded.  \"It's a silly thing\nfor you to do.  Of course you don't mean anything, except to torment\nWhit.  But cut it out.  The gang will make him miserable and we'll lose\nthe game.  There's no telling what might happen.\"\n\n\"I'm supremely indifferent to what happens,\" she replied, with a\nrebellious toss of her black head.  \"I hope Whit gets beaten.\"\n\nShe went to the game with Henderson and sat in the grand stand, and the\nboys spied them out and told the Rube.  He did not believe it at first,\nbut finally saw them, looked deeply hurt and offended, and then grew\nangry.  But the gong, sounding at that moment, drew his attention to\nhis business of the day, to pitch.\n\nHis work that day reminded me of the first game he ever pitched for me,\nupon which occasion Captain Spears got the best out of him by making\nhim angry.  For several innings Providence was helpless before his\ndelivery.  Then something happened that showed me a crisis was near.  A\nwag of a fan yelled from the bleachers.\n\n\"Honeymoon Rube!\"\n\nThis cry was taken up by the delighted fans and it rolled around the\nfield.  But the Rube pitched on, harder than ever.  Then the knowing\nbleacherite who had started the cry changed it somewhat.\n\n\"Nanny's Rube!\" he yelled.\n\nThis, too, went the rounds, and still the Rube, though red in the face,\npreserved his temper and his pitching control.  All would have been\nwell if Bud Wiler, comedian of the Providence team, had not hit upon a\nway to rattle Rube.\n\n\"Nanny's Goat!\" he shouted from the coaching lines.  Every Providence\nplayer took it up.\n\nThe Rube was not proof against that.  He yelled so fiercely at them,\nand glared so furiously, and towered so formidably, that they ceased\nfor the moment.  Then he let drive with his fast straight ball and hit\nthe first Providence batter in the ribs.  His comrades had to help him\nto the bench.  The Rube hit the next batter on the leg, and judging\nfrom the crack of the ball, I fancied that player would walk lame for\nseveral days. The Rube tried to hit the next batter and sent him to\nfirst on balls.  Thereafter it became a dodging contest with honors\nabout equal between pitcher and batters.  The Providence players\nstormed and the bleachers roared.  But I would not take the Rube out\nand the game went on with the Rube forcing in runs.\n\nWith the score a tie, and three men on bases one of the players on the\nbench again yelled \"Nanny's Goat!\"\n\nStraight as a string the Rube shot the ball at this fellow and bounded\nafter it.  The crowd rose in an uproar.  The base runners began to\nscore. I left my bench and ran across the space, but not in time to\ncatch the Rube.  I saw him hit two or three of the Providence men.\nThen the policemen got to him, and a real fight brought the big\naudience into the stamping melee.  Before the Rube was collared I saw\nat least four blue-coats on the grass.\n\nThe game broke up, and the crowd spilled itself in streams over the\nfield.  Excitement ran high.  I tried to force my way into the mass to\nget at the Rube and the officers, but this was impossible.  I feared\nthe Rube would be taken from the officers and treated with violence, so\nI waited with the surging crowd, endeavoring to get nearer.  Soon we\nwere in the street, and it seemed as if all the stands had emptied\ntheir yelling occupants.\n\nA trolley car came along down the street, splitting the mass of people\nand driving them back. A dozen policemen summarily bundled the Rube\nupon the rear end of the car.  Some of these officers boarded the car,\nand some remained in the street to beat off the vengeful fans.\n\nI saw some one thrust forward a frantic young woman.  The officers\nstopped her, then suddenly helped her on the car, just as I started.  I\nrecognized Nan.  She gripped the Rube with both hands and turned a\nwhite, fearful face upon the angry crowd.\n\nThe Rube stood in the grasp of his wife and the policemen, and he\nlooked like a ruffled lion. He shook his big fist and bawled in\nfar-reaching voice:\n\n\"I can lick you all!\"\n\nTo my infinite relief, the trolley gathered momentum and safely passed\nout of danger.  The last thing I made out was Nan pressing close to the\nRube's side.  That moment saw their reconciliation and my joy that it\nwas the end of the Rube's Honeymoon.\n\n\n\nTHE RUBE'S WATERLOO\n\nIt was about the sixth inning that I suspected the Rube of weakening.\nFor that matter he had not pitched anything resembling his usual brand\nof baseball.  But the Rube had developed into such a wonder in the box\nthat it took time for his let-down to dawn upon me.  Also it took a tip\nfrom Raddy, who sat with me on the bench.\n\n\"Con, the Rube isn't himself today,\" said Radbourne.  \"His mind's not\non the game.  He seems hurried and flustered, too.  If he doesn't\nexplode presently, I'm a dub at callin' the turn.\"\n\nRaddy was the best judge of a pitcher's condition, physical or mental,\nin the Eastern League. It was a Saturday and we were on the road and\nfinishing up a series with the Rochesters.  Each team had won and lost\na game, and, as I was climbing close to the leaders in the pennant\nrace, I wanted the third and deciding game of that Rochester series.\nThe usual big Saturday crowd was in attendance, noisy, demonstrative\nand exacting.\n\nIn this sixth inning the first man up for Rochester had flied to\nMcCall.  Then had come the two plays significant of Rube's weakening.\nHe had hit one batter and walked another.  This was sufficient,\nconsidering the score was three to one in our favor, to bring the\naudience to its feet with a howling, stamping demand for runs.\n\n\"Spears is wise all right,\" said Raddy.\n\nI watched the foxy old captain walk over to the Rube and talk to him\nwhile he rested, a reassuring hand on the pitcher's shoulder.  The\ncrowd yelled its disapproval and Umpire Bates called out sharply:\n\n\"Spears, get back to the bag!\"\n\n\"Now, Mister Umpire, ain't I hurrin' all I can?\" queried Spears as he\nleisurely ambled back to first.\n\nThe Rube tossed a long, damp welt of hair back from his big brow and\nnervously toed the rubber. I noted that he seemed to forget the runners\non bases and delivered the ball without glancing at either bag.  Of\ncourse this resulted in a double steal.  The ball went wild--almost a\nwild pitch.\n\n\"Steady up, old man,\" called Gregg between the yells of the bleachers.\nHe held his mitt square over the plate for the Rube to pitch to.  Again\nthe long twirler took his swing, and again the ball went wild.  Clancy\nhad the Rube in the hole now and the situation began to grow serious.\nThe Rube did not take half his usual deliberation, and of the next two\npitches one of them was a ball and the other a strike by grace of the\numpire's generosity.  Clancy rapped the next one, an absurdly slow\npitch for the Rube to use, and both runners scored to the shrill tune\nof the happy bleachers.\n\nI saw Spears shake his head and look toward the bench.  It was plain\nwhat that meant.\n\n\"Raddy, I ought to take the Rube out,\" I said, \"but whom can I put in?\nYou worked yesterday--Cairns' arm is sore.  It's got to be nursed. And\nHenderson, that ladies' man I just signed, is not in uniform.\"\n\n\"I'll go in,\" replied Raddy, instantly.\n\n\"Not on your life.\"  I had as hard a time keeping Radbourne from\noverworking as I had in getting enough work out of some other players.\n\"I guess I'll let the Rube take his medicine.  I hate to lose this\ngame, but if we have to, we can stand it.  I'm curious, anyway, to see\nwhat's the matter with the Rube.  Maybe he'll settle down presently.\"\n\nI made no sign that I had noticed Spears' appeal to the bench.  And my\naggressive players, no doubt seeing the situation as I saw it, sang out\ntheir various calls of cheer to the Rube and of defiance to their\nantagonists.  Clancy stole off first base so far that the Rube,\ncatching somebody's warning too late, made a balk and the umpire sent\nthe runner on to second.  The Rube now plainly showed painful evidences\nof being rattled.\n\nHe could not locate the plate without slowing up and when he did that a\nRochester player walloped the ball.  Pretty soon he pitched as if he\ndid not care, and but for the fast fielding of the team behind him the\nRochesters would have scored more than the eight runs it got.  When the\nRube came in to the bench I asked him if he was sick and at first he\nsaid he was and then that he was not.  So I let him pitch the remaining\ninnings, as the game was lost anyhow, and we walked off the field a\nbadly beaten team.\n\nThat night we had to hurry from the hotel to catch a train for\nWorcester and we had dinner in the dining-car.  Several of my players'\nwives had come over from Worcester to meet us, and were in the\ndining-car when I entered.  I observed a pretty girl sitting at one of\nthe tables with my new pitcher, Henderson.\n\n\"Say, Mac,\" I said to McCall, who was with me, \"is Henderson married?\"\n\n\"Naw, but he looks like he wanted to be.  He was in the grand stand\ntoday with that girl.\"\n\n\"Who is she?  Oh! a little peach!\"\n\nA second glance at Henderson's companion brought this compliment from\nme involuntarily.\n\n\"Con, you'll get it as bad as the rest of this mushy bunch of ball\nplayers.  We're all stuck on that kid.  But since Henderson came she's\nbeen a frost to all of us.  An' it's put the Rube in the dumps.\"\n\n\"Who's the girl?\"\n\n\"That's Nan Brown.  She lives in Worcester an' is the craziest girl fan\nI ever seen.  Flirt! Well, she's got them all beat.  Somebody\nintroduced the Rube to her.  He has been mooney ever since.\"\n\nThat was enough to whet my curiosity, and I favored Miss Brown with\nmore than one glance during dinner.  When we returned to the parlor car\nI took advantage of the opportunity and remarked to Henderson that he\nmight introduce his manager.  He complied, but not with amiable grace.\n\nSo I chatted with Nan Brown, and studied her. She was a pretty,\nlaughing, coquettish little minx and quite baseball mad.  I had met\nmany girl fans, but none so enthusiastic as Nan.  But she was wholesome\nand sincere, and I liked her.\n\nBefore turning in I sat down beside the Rube. He was very quiet and his\nface did not encourage company.  But that did not stop me.\n\n\"Hello, Whit; have a smoke before you go to bed?\" I asked cheerfully.\n\nHe scarcely heard me and made no move to take the proffered cigar.  All\nat once it struck me that the rustic simplicity which had characterized\nhim had vanished.\n\n\"Whit, old fellow, what was wrong today?\" I asked, quietly, with my\nhand on his arm.\n\n\"Mr. Connelly, I want my release, I want to go back to Rickettsville,\"\nhe replied hurriedly.\n\nFor the space of a few seconds I did some tall thinking.  The situation\nsuddenly became grave. I saw the pennant for the Worcesters fading,\ndimming.\n\n\"You want to go home?\" I began slowly. \"Why, Whit, I can't keep you.  I\nwouldn't try if you didn't want to stay.  But I'll tell you\nconfidentially, if you leave me at this stage I'm ruined.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" he inquired, keenly looking at me.\n\n\"Well, I can't win the pennant without you.  If I do win it there's a\nbig bonus for me.  I can buy the house I want and get married this fall\nif I capture the flag.  You've met Milly.  You can imagine what your\npitching means to me this year.  That's all.\"\n\nHe averted his face and looked out of the window. His big jaw quivered.\n\n\"If it's that--why, I'll stay, I reckon,\" he said huskily.\n\nThat moment bound Whit Hurtle and Frank Connelly into a far closer\nrelation than the one between player and manager.  I sat silent for a\nwhile, listening to the drowsy talk of the other players and the rush\nand roar of the train as it sped on into the night.\n\n\"Thank you, old chap,\" I replied.  \"It wouldn't have been like you to\nthrow me down at this stage.  Whit, you're in trouble?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Can I help you--in any way?\"'\n\n\"I reckon not.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure of that.  I'm a pretty wise guy, if I do say it\nmyself.  I might be able to do as much for you as you're going to do\nfor me.\"\n\nThe sight of his face convinced me that I had taken a wrong tack.  It\nalso showed me how deep Whit's trouble really was.  I bade him good\nnight and went to my berth, where sleep did not soon visit me.  A\nsaucy, sparkling-eyed woman barred Whit Hurtle's baseball career at its\nthreshold.\n\nWomen are just as fatal to ball players as to men in any other walk of\nlife.  I had seen a strong athlete grow palsied just at a scornful\nslight.  It's a great world, and the women run it.  So I lay awake\nracking my brains to outwit a pretty disorganizer; and I plotted for\nher sake.  Married, she would be out of mischief.  For Whit's sake, for\nMilly's sake, for mine, all of which collectively meant for the sake of\nthe pennant, this would be the solution of the problem.\n\nI decided to take Milly into my confidence, and finally on the strength\nof that I got to sleep.  In the morning I went to my hotel, had\nbreakfast, attended to my mail, and then boarded a car to go out to\nMilly's house.  She was waiting for me on the porch, dressed as I liked\nto see her, in blue and white, and she wore violets that matched the\ncolor of her eyes.\n\n\"Hello, Connie.  I haven't seen a morning paper, but I know from your\nface that you lost the Rochester series,\" said Milly, with a gay laugh.\n\n\"I guess yes.  The Rube blew up, and if we don't play a pretty smooth\ngame, young lady, he'll never come down.\"\n\nThen I told her.\n\n\"Why, Connie, I knew long ago.  Haven't you seen the change in him\nbefore this?\"\n\n\"What change?\" I asked blankly.\n\n\"You are a man.  Well, he was a gawky, slouchy, shy farmer boy when he\ncame to us.  Of course the city life and popularity began to influence\nhim.  Then he met Nan.  She made the Rube a worshipper.  I first\nnoticed a change in his clothes.  He blossomed out in a new suit, white\nnegligee, neat tie and a stylish straw hat. Then it was evident he was\nmaking heroic struggles to overcome his awkwardness.  It was plain he\nwas studying and copying the other boys. He's wonderfully improved, but\nstill shy.  He'll always be shy.  Connie, Whit's a fine fellow, too\ngood for Nan Brown.\"\n\n\"But, Milly,\" I interrupted, \"the Rube's hard hit.  Why is he too good\nfor her?\"\n\n\"Nan is a natural-born flirt,\" Milly replied. \"She can't help it.  I'm\nafraid Whit has a slim chance.  Nan may not see deep enough to learn\nhis fine qualities.  I fancy Nan tired quickly of him, though the one\ntime I saw them together she appeared to like him very well.  This new\npitcher of yours, Henderson, is a handsome fellow and smooth.  Whit is\nlosing to him.  Nan likes flash, flattery, excitement.\"\n\n\"McCall told me the Rube had been down in the mouth ever since\nHenderson joined the team. Milly, I don't like Henderson a whole lot.\nHe's not in the Rube's class as a pitcher.  What am I going to do?\nLose the pennant and a big slice of purse money just for a pretty\nlittle flirt?\"\n\n\"Oh, Connie, it's not so bad as that.  Whit will come around all right.\"\n\n\"He won't unless we can pull some wires.  I've got to help him win Nan\nBrown.  What do you think of that for a manager's job?  I guess maybe\nwinning pennants doesn't call for diplomatic genius and cunning!  But\nI'll hand them a few tricks before I lose.  My first move will be to\ngive Henderson his release.\"\n\nI left Milly, as always, once more able to make light of\ndiscouragements and difficulties.\n\nMonday I gave Henderson his unconditional release.  He celebrated the\noccasion by verifying certain rumors I had heard from other managers.\nHe got drunk.  But he did not leave town, and I heard that he was\nnegotiating with Providence for a place on that team.\n\nRadbourne pitched one of his gilt-edged games that afternoon against\nHartford and we won. And Milly sat in the grand stand, having contrived\nby cleverness to get a seat next to Nan Brown.  Milly and I were\nplaying a vastly deeper game than baseball--a game with hearts.  But we\nwere playing it with honest motive, for the good of all concerned, we\nbelieved, and on the square. I sneaked a look now and then up into the\ngrand stand.  Milly and Nan appeared to be getting on famously.  It was\ncertain that Nan was flushed and excited, no doubt consciously proud of\nbeing seen with my affianced.  After the game I chanced to meet them on\ntheir way out.  Milly winked at me, which was her sign that all was\nworking beautifully.\n\nI hunted up the Rube and bundled him off to the hotel to take dinner\nwith me.  At first he was glum, but after a while he brightened up\nsomewhat to my persistent cheer and friendliness. Then we went out on\nthe hotel balcony to smoke, and there I made my play.\n\n\"Whit, I'm pulling a stroke for you.  Now listen and don't be offended.\nI know what's put you off your feed, because I was the same way when\nMilly had me guessing.  You've lost your head over Nan Brown.  That's\nnot so terrible, though I daresay you think it's a catastrophe.\nBecause you've quit.  You've shown a yellow streak. You've lain down.\n\n\"My boy, that isn't the way to win a girl. You've got to scrap.  Milly\ntold me yesterday how she had watched your love affairs with Nan, and\nhow she thought you had given up just when things might have come your\nway.  Nan is a little flirt, but she's all right.  What's more, she was\ngetting fond of you.  Nan is meanest to the man she likes best.  The\nway to handle her, Whit, is to master her.  Play high and mighty.  Get\ntragical.  Then grab her up in your arms.  I tell you, Whit, it'll all\ncome your way if you only keep your nerve.  I'm your friend and so is\nMilly. We're going out to her house presently--and Nan will be there.\"\n\nThe Rube drew a long, deep breath and held out his hand.  I sensed\nanother stage in the evolution of Whit Hurtle.\n\n\"I reckon I've taken baseball coachin',\" he said presently, \"an' I\ndon't see why I can't take some other kind.  I'm only a rube, an'\nthings come hard for me, but I'm a-learnin'.\"\n\nIt was about dark when we arrived at the house.\n\n\"Hello, Connie.  You're late.  Good evening, Mr. Hurtle.  Come right\nin.  You've met Miss Nan Brown?  Oh, of course; how stupid of me!\"\n\nIt was a trying moment for Milly and me.  A little pallor showed under\nthe Rube's tan, but he was more composed than I had expected.  Nan got\nup from the piano.  She was all in white and deliciously pretty.  She\ngave a quick, glad start of surprise.  What a relief that was to my\ntroubled mind!  Everything had depended upon a real honest liking for\nWhit, and she had it.\n\nMore than once I had been proud of Milly's cleverness, but this night\nas hostess and an accomplice she won my everlasting admiration. She\ncontrived to give the impression that Whit was a frequent visitor at\nher home and very welcome.  She brought out his best points, and in her\nskillful hands he lost embarrassment and awkwardness. Before the\nevening was over Nan regarded Whit with different eyes, and she never\ndreamed that everything had not come about naturally.  Then Milly\nsomehow got me out on the porch, leaving Nan and Whit together.\n\n\"Milly, you're a marvel, the best and sweetest ever,\" I whispered.\n\"We're going to win.  It's a cinch.\"\n\n\"Well, Connie, not that--exactly,\" she whispered back demurely.  \"But\nit looks hopeful.\"\n\nI could not help hearing what was said in the parlor.\n\n\"Now I can roast you,\" Nan was saying, archly. She had switched back to\nher favorite baseball vernacular.  \"You pitched a swell game last\nSaturday in Rochester, didn't you?  Not!  You had no steam, no control,\nand you couldn't have curved a saucer.\"\n\n\"Nan, what could you expect?\" was the cool reply.  \"You sat up in the\nstand with your handsome friend.  I reckon I couldn't pitch.  I just\ngave the game away.\"\n\n\"Whit!--Whit!----\"\n\nThen I whispered to Milly that it might be discreet for us to move a\nlittle way from the vicinity.\n\nIt was on the second day afterward that I got a chance to talk to Nan.\nShe reached the grounds early, before Milly arrived, and I found her in\nthe grand stand.  The Rube was down on the card to pitch and when he\nstarted to warm up Nan said confidently that he would shut out Hartford\nthat afternoon.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Nan, but you're way off.  We'd do well to win at all, let\nalone get a shutout.\"\n\n\"You're a fine manager!\" she retorted, hotly. \"Why won't we win?\"\n\n\"Well, the Rube's not in good form.  The Rube----\"\n\n\"Stop calling him that horrid name.\"\n\n\"Whit's not in shape.  He's not right.  He's ill or something is wrong.\nI'm worried sick about him.\"\n\n\"Why--Mr. Connelly!\" exclaimed Nan.  She turned quickly toward me.\n\nI crowded on full canvas of gloom to my already long face.\n\n\"I'm serious, Nan.  The lad's off, somehow. He's in magnificent\nphysical trim, but he can't keep his mind on the game.  He has lost his\nhead. I've talked with him, reasoned with him, all to no good.  He only\ngoes down deeper in the dumps. Something is terribly wrong with him,\nand if he doesn't brace, I'll have to release----\"\n\nMiss Nan Brown suddenly lost a little of her rich bloom.  \"Oh! you\nwouldn't--you couldn't release him!\"\n\n\"I'll have to if he doesn't brace.  It means a lot to me, Nan, for of\ncourse I can't win the pennant this year without Whit being in shape.\nBut I believe I wouldn't mind the loss of that any more than to see him\nfall down.  The boy is a magnificent pitcher.  If he can only be\nbrought around he'll go to the big league next year and develop into\none of the greatest pitchers the game has ever produced.  But somehow\nor other he has lost heart.  He's quit.  And I've done my best for him.\nHe's beyond me now.  What a shame it is!  For he's the making of such a\nsplendid man outside of baseball.  Milly thinks the world of him.\nWell, well; there are disappointments--we can't help them.  There goes\nthe gong.  I must leave you.  Nan, I'll bet you a box of candy Whit\nloses today.  Is it a go?\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied Nan, with fire in her eyes. \"You go to Whit Hurtle and\ntell him I said if he wins today's game I'll kiss him!\"\n\nI nearly broke my neck over benches and bats getting to Whit with that\nmessage.  He gulped once.\n\nThen he tightened his belt and shut out Hartford with two scratch\nsingles.  It was a great exhibition of pitching.  I had no means to\ntell whether or not the Rube got his reward that night, but I was so\nhappy that I hugged Milly within an inch of her life.\n\nBut it turned out that I had been a little premature in my elation.  In\ntwo days the Rube went down into the depths again, this time clear to\nChina, and Nan was sitting in the grand stand with Henderson.  The Rube\nlost his next game, pitching like a schoolboy scared out of his wits.\nHenderson followed Nan like a shadow, so that I had no chance to talk\nto her.  The Rube lost his next game and then another.  We were pushed\nout of second place.\n\nIf we kept up that losing streak a little longer, our hopes for the\npennant were gone.  I had begun to despair of the Rube.  For some\noccult reason he scarcely spoke to me.  Nan flirted worse than ever.\nIt seemed to me she flaunted her conquest of Henderson in poor Whit's\nface.\n\nThe Providence ball team came to town and promptly signed Henderson and\nannounced him for Saturday's game.  Cairns won the first of the series\nand Radbourne lost the second.  It was Rube's turn to pitch the\nSaturday game and I resolved to make one more effort to put the\nlove-sick swain in something like his old fettle.  So I called upon Nan.\n\nShe was surprised to see me, but received me graciously.  I fancied her\nface was not quite so glowing as usual.  I came bluntly out with my\nmission.  She tried to freeze me but I would not freeze.  I was out to\nwin or lose and not to be lightly laughed aside or coldly denied.  I\nplayed to make her angry, knowing the real truth of her feelings would\nshow under stress.\n\nFor once in my life I became a knocker and said some unpleasant\nthings--albeit they were true--about Henderson.  She championed\nHenderson royally, and when, as a last card, I compared Whit's fine\nrecord with Henderson's, not only as a ball player, but as a man,\nparticularly in his reverence for women, she flashed at me:\n\n\"What do you know about it?  Mr. Henderson asked me to marry him.  Can\na man do more to show his respect?  Your friend never so much as hinted\nsuch honorable intentions.  What's more--he insulted me!\"  The blaze in\nNan's black eyes softened with a film of tears.  She looked hurt.  Her\npride had encountered a fall.\n\n\"Oh, no, Nan, Whit couldn't insult a lady,\" I protested.\n\n\"Couldn't he?  That's all you know about him. You know I--I promised to\nkiss him if he beat Hartford that day.  So when he came I--I did. Then\nthe big savage began to rave and he grabbed me up in his arms.  He\nsmothered me; almost crushed the life out of me.  He frightened me\nterribly.  When I got away from him--the monster stood there and coolly\nsaid I belonged to him.  I ran out of the room and wouldn't see him any\nmore.  At first I might have forgiven him if he had apologized--said he\nwas sorry, but never a word.  Now I never will forgive him.\"\n\nI had to make a strenuous effort to conceal my agitation.  The Rube had\nmost carefully taken my fool advice in the matter of wooing a woman.\n\nWhen I had got a hold upon myself, I turned to Nan white-hot with\neloquence.  Now I was talking not wholly for myself or the pennant, but\nfor this boy and girl who were at odds in that strangest game of\nlife--love.\n\nWhat I said I never knew, but Nan lost her resentment, and then her\nscorn and indifference. Slowly she thawed and warmed to my reason,\npraise, whatever it was, and when I stopped she was again the radiant\nbewildering Nan of old.\n\n\"Take another message to Whit for me,\" she said, audaciously.  \"Tell\nhim I adore ball players, especially pitchers.  Tell him I'm going to\nthe game today to choose the best one.  If he loses the game----\"\n\nShe left the sentence unfinished.  In my state of mind I doubted not in\nthe least that she meant to marry the pitcher who won the game, and so\nI told the Rube.  He made one wild upheaval of his arms and shoulders,\nlike an erupting volcano, which proved to me that he believed it, too.\n\nWhen I got to the bench that afternoon I was tired.  There was a big\ncrowd to see the game; the weather was perfect; Milly sat up in the box\nand waved her score card at me; Raddy and Spears declared we had the\ngame; the Rube stalked to and fro like an implacable Indian chief--but\nI was not happy in mind.  Calamity breathed in the very air.\n\nThe game began.  McCall beat out a bunt; Ashwell sacrificed and\nStringer laced one of his beautiful triples against the fence.  Then he\nscored on a high fly.  Two runs!  Worcester trotted out into the field.\nThe Rube was white with determination; he had the speed of a bullet and\nperfect control of his jump ball and drop.  But Providence hit and had\nthe luck.  Ashwell fumbled, Gregg threw wild.  Providence tied the\nscore.\n\nThe game progressed, growing more and more of a nightmare to me.  It\nwas not Worcester's day.  The umpire could not see straight; the boys\ngrumbled and fought among themselves; Spears roasted the umpire and was\nsent to the bench; Bogart tripped, hurting his sore ankle, and had to\nbe taken out.  Henderson's slow, easy ball baffled my players, and when\nhe used speed they lined it straight at a Providence fielder.\n\nIn the sixth, after a desperate rally, we crowded the bases with only\none out.  Then Mullaney's hard rap to left, seemingly good for three\nbases, was pulled down by Stone with one hand.  It was a wonderful\ncatch and he doubled up a runner at second.  Again in the seventh we\nhad a chance to score, only to fail on another double play, this time\nby the infield.\n\nWhen the Providence players were at bat their luck not only held good\nbut trebled and quadrupled.  The little Texas-league hits dropped\nsafely just out of reach of the infielders.  My boys had an off day in\nfielding.  What horror that of all days in a season this should be the\none for them to make errors!\n\nBut they were game, and the Rube was the gamest of all.  He did not\nseem to know what hard luck was, or discouragement, or poor support. He\nkept everlastingly hammering the ball at those lucky Providence\nhitters.  What speed he had!  The ball streaked in, and somebody would\nshut his eyes and make a safety.  But the Rube pitched, on, tireless,\nirresistibly, hopeful, not forgetting to call a word of cheer to his\nfielders.\n\nIt was one of those strange games that could not be bettered by any\nlabor or daring or skill. I saw it was lost from the second inning, yet\nso deeply was I concerned, so tantalizingly did the plays reel\nthemselves off, that I groveled there on the bench unable to abide by\nmy baseball sense.\n\nThe ninth inning proved beyond a shadow of doubt how baseball fate, in\ncommon with other fates, loved to balance the chances, to lift up one,\nthen the other, to lend a deceitful hope only to dash it away.\n\nProvidence had almost three times enough to win.  The team let up in\nthat inning or grew over-confident or careless, and before we knew what\nhad happened some scratch hits, and bases on balls, and errors, gave us\nthree runs and left two runners on bases.  The disgusted bleachers came\nout of their gloom and began to whistle and thump.  The Rube hit\nsafely, sending another run over the plate.  McCall worked his old\ntrick, beating out a slow bunt.\n\nBases full, three runs to tie!  With Ashwell up and one out, the noise\nin the bleachers mounted to a high-pitched, shrill, continuous sound.\nI got up and yelled with all my might and could not hear my voice.\nAshwell was a dangerous man in a pinch.  The game was not lost yet.  A\nhit, anything to get Ash to first--and then Stringer!\n\nAsh laughed at Henderson, taunted him, shook his bat at him and dared\nhim to put one over. Henderson did not stand under fire.  The ball he\npitched had no steam.  Ash cracked it--square on the line into the\nshortstop's hands.  The bleachers ceased yelling.\n\nThen Stringer strode grimly to the plate.  It was a hundred to one, in\nthat instance, that he would lose the ball.  The bleachers let out one\ndeafening roar, then hushed.  I would rather have had Stringer at the\nbat than any other player in the world, and I thought of the Rube and\nNan and Milly--and hope would not die.\n\nStringer swung mightily on the first pitch and struck the ball with a\nsharp, solid bing!  It shot toward center, low, level, exceedingly\nswift, and like a dark streak went straight into the fielder's hands.\nA rod to right or left would have made it a home run.  The crowd\nstrangled a victorious yell.  I came out of my trance, for the game was\nover and lost.  It was the Rube's Waterloo.\n\nI hurried him into the dressing room and kept close to him.  He looked\nlike a man who had lost the one thing worth while in his life.  I\nturned a deaf ear to my players, to everybody, and hustled the Rube out\nand to the hotel.  I wanted to be near him that night.\n\nTo my amaze we met Milly and Nan as we entered the lobby.  Milly wore a\nsweet, sympathetic smile.  Nan shone more radiant than ever. I simply\nstared.  It was Milly who got us all through the corridor into the\nparlor.  I heard Nan talking.\n\n\"Whit, you pitched a bad game but--\" there was the old teasing, arch,\ncoquettishness--\"but you are the best pitcher!\"\n\n\"Nan!\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\n\nBREAKING INTO FAST COMPANY\n\nThey may say baseball is the same in the minor leagues that it is in\nthe big leagues, but any old ball player or manager knows better.\nWhere the difference comes in, however, is in the greater excellence\nand unity of the major players, a speed, a daring, a finish that can be\nacquired only in competition with one another.\n\nI thought of this when I led my party into Morrisey's private box in\nthe grand stand of the Chicago American League grounds.  We had come to\nsee the Rube's break into fast company. My great pitcher, Whittaker\nHurtle, the Rube, as we called him, had won the Eastern League Pennant\nfor me that season, and Morrisey, the Chicago magnate, had bought him.\nMilly, my affianced, was with me, looking as happy as she was pretty,\nand she was chaperoned by her mother, Mrs. Nelson.\n\nWith me, also, were two veterans of my team, McCall and Spears, who\nlived in Chicago, and who would have traveled a few miles to see the\nRube pitch.  And the other member of my party was Mrs. Hurtle, the\nRube's wife, as saucy and as sparkling-eyed as when she had been Nan\nBrown.  Today she wore a new tailor-made gown, new bonnet, new\ngloves--she said she had decorated herself in a manner befitting the\nwife of a major league pitcher.\n\nMorrisey's box was very comfortable, and, as I was pleased to note, so\nsituated that we had a fine view of the field and stands, and yet were\ncomparatively secluded.  The bleachers were filling. Some of the\nChicago players were on the field tossing and batting balls; the Rube,\nhowever, had not yet appeared.\n\nA moment later a metallic sound was heard on the stairs leading up into\nthe box.  I knew it for baseball spiked shoes clanking on the wood.\n\nThe Rube, looking enormous in his uniform, stalked into the box,\nknocking over two chairs as he entered.  He carried a fielder's glove\nin one huge freckled hand, and a big black bat in the other.\n\nNan, with much dignity and a very manifest pride, introduced him to\nMrs. Nelson.\n\nThere was a little chatting, and then, upon the arrival of Manager\nMorrisey, we men retired to the back of the box to talk baseball.\n\nChicago was in fourth place in the league race, and had a fighting\nchance to beat Detroit out for the third position.  Philadelphia was\nscheduled for that day, and Philadelphia had a great team. It was\nleading the race, and almost beyond all question would land the flag.\nIn truth, only one more victory was needed to clinch the pennant. The\nteam had three games to play in Chicago and it was to wind up the\nseason with three in Washington.  Six games to play and only one\nimperatively important to win!  But baseball is uncertain, and until\nthe Philadelphians won that game they would be a band of fiends.\n\n\"Well, Whit, this is where you break in,\" I said.  \"Now, tip us\nstraight.  You've had more than a week's rest.  How's that arm?\"\n\n\"Grand, Con, grand!\" replied the Rube with his frank smile.  \"I was a\nlittle anxious till I warmed up.  But say!  I've got more up my sleeve\ntoday than I ever had.\"\n\n\"That'll do for me,\" said Morrisey, rubbing his hands.  \"I'll spring\nsomething on these swelled Quakers today.  Now, Connelly, give Hurtle\none of your old talks--the last one--and then I'll ring the gong.\"\n\nI added some words of encouragement, not forgetting my old ruse to\nincite the Rube by rousing his temper.  And then, as the gong rang and\nthe Rube was departing, Nan stepped forward for her say.  There was a\nlittle white under the tan on her cheek, and her eyes had a darkling\nflash.\n\n\"Whit, it's a magnificent sight--that beautiful green field and the\nstands.  What a crowd of fans!  Why, I never saw a real baseball crowd\nbefore.  There are twenty thousand here.  And there's a difference in\nthe feeling.  It's sharper--new to me.  It's big league baseball.  Not\na soul in that crowd ever heard of you, but, I believe, tomorrow the\nwhole baseball world will have heard of you.  Mr. Morrisey knows.  I\nsaw it in his face.  Captain Spears knows.  Connie knows.  I know.\"\n\nThen she lifted her face and, pulling him down within reach, she kissed\nhim.  Nan took her husband's work in dead earnest; she gloried in it,\nand perhaps she had as much to do with making him a great pitcher as\nany of us.\n\nThe Rube left the box, and I found a seat between Nan and Milly.  The\nfield was a splendid sight.  Those bleachers made me glow with\nmanagerial satisfaction.  On the field both teams pranced and danced\nand bounced around in practice.\n\nIn spite of the absolutely last degree of egotism manifested by the\nPhiladelphia players, I could not but admire such a splendid body of\nmen.\n\n\"So these are the champions of last season and of this season, too,\"\ncommented Milly.  \"I don't wonder.  How swiftly and cleanly they play!\nThey appear not to exert themselves, yet they always get the ball in\nperfect time.  It all reminds me of--of the rhythm of music.  And that\nchampion batter and runner--that Lane in center--isn't he just\nbeautiful?  He walks and runs like a blue-ribbon winner at the horse\nshow.  I tell you one thing, Connie, these Quakers are on dress parade.\"\n\n\"Oh, these Quakers hate themselves, I don't think!\" retorted Nan.\nBeing a rabid girl-fan it was, of course, impossible for Nan to speak\nbaseball convictions or gossip without characteristic baseball slang.\n\"Stuck on themselves!  I never saw the like in my life.  That fellow\nLane is so swelled that he can't get down off his toes.  But he's a\nwonder, I must admit that.  They're a bunch of stars.  Easy, fast,\ntrained--they're machines, and I'll bet they're Indians to fight.  I\ncan see it sticking out all over them.  This will certainly be some\ngame with Whit handing up that jump ball of his to this gang of champs.\nBut, Connie, I'll go you Whit beats them.\"\n\nI laughed and refused to gamble.\n\nThe gong rang; the crowd seemed to hum and rustle softly to quiet\nattention; Umpire McClung called the names of the batteries; then the\nfamiliar \"Play!\"\n\nThere was the usual applause from the grand stand and welcome cheers\nfrom the bleachers. The Rube was the last player to go out. Morrisey\nwas a manager who always played to the stands, and no doubt he held the\nRube back for effect.  If so, he ought to have been gratified. That\nmoment reminded me of my own team and audience upon the occasion of the\nRube's debut. It was the same only here it happened in the big league,\nbefore a championship team and twenty thousand fans.\n\nThe roar that went up from the bleachers might well have scared an\nunseasoned pitcher out of his wits.  And the Quakers lined up before\ntheir bench and gazed at this newcomer who had the nerve to walk out\nthere to the box.  Cogswell stood on the coaching line, looked at the\nRube and then held up both arms and turned toward the Chicago bench as\nif to ask Morrisey:  \"Where did you get that?\"\n\nNan, quick as a flash to catch a point, leaned over the box-rail and\nlooked at the champions with fire in her eye.  \"Oh, you just wait!\nwait!\" she bit out between her teeth.\n\nCertain it was that there was no one who knew the Rube as well as I;\nand I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that the hour before me would\nsee brightening of a great star pitcher on the big league horizon.  It\nwas bound to be a full hour for me.  I had much reason to be grateful\nto Whit Hurtle.  He had pulled my team out of a rut and won me the\npennant, and the five thousand dollars I got for his release bought the\nlittle cottage on the hill for Milly and me.  Then there was my pride\nin having developed him.  And all that I needed to calm me, settle me\ndown into assurance and keen criticism of the game, was to see the Rube\npitch a few balls with his old incomparable speed and control.\n\nBerne, first batter for the Quakers, walked up to the plate.  He was\nanother Billy Hamilton, built like a wedge.  I saw him laugh at the\nlong pitcher.\n\nWhit swayed back, coiled and uncoiled.  Something thin, white,\nglancing, shot at Berne.  He ducked, escaping the ball by a smaller\nmargin than appeared good for his confidence.  He spoke low to the\nRube, and what he said was probably not flavored with the milk of\nfriendly sweetness.\n\n\"Wild!  What'd you look for?\" called out Cogswell scornfully.  \"He's\nfrom the woods!\"\n\nThe Rube swung his enormously long arm, took an enormous stride toward\nthird base, and pitched again.  It was one of his queer deliveries.\nThe ball cut the plate.\n\n\"Ho!  Ho!\" yelled the Quakers.\n\nThe Rube's next one was his out curve.  It broke toward the corner of\nthe plate and would have been a strike had not Berne popped it up.\n\nCallopy, the second hitter, faced the Rube, and he, too, after the\nmanner of ball players, made some remark meant only for the Rube's\nears. Callopy was a famous waiter.  He drove more pitchers mad with his\nimplacable patience than any hitter in the league.  The first one of\nthe Rube's he waited on crossed the in-corner; the second crossed the\nout-corner and the third was Rube's wide, slow, tantalizing\n\"stitch-ball,\" as we call it, for the reason that it came so slow a\nbatter could count the stitches.  I believe Callopy waited on that\ncurve, decided to hit it, changed his mind and waited some more, and\nfinally the ball maddened him and he had to poke at it, the result\nbeing a weak grounder.\n\nThen the graceful, powerful Lane, champion batter, champion base\nrunner, stepped to the plate.  How a baseball crowd, any crowd,\nanywhere, loves the champion batter!  The ovation Lane received made me\nwonder, with this impressive reception in a hostile camp, what could be\nthe manner of it on his home field?  Any boy ball-player from the lots\nseeing Lane knock the dirt out of his spikes and step into position\nwould have known he was a 400 hitter.\n\nI was curious to see what the Rube would pitch Lane.  It must have been\na new and significant moment for Hurtle.  Some pitchers actually wilt\nwhen facing a hitter of Lane's reputation.  But he, on his baseball\nside, was peculiarly unemotional. Undoubtedly he could get furious, but\nthat only increased his effectiveness.  To my amazement the Rube\npitched Lane a little easy ball, not in any sense like his floater or\nstitch-ball, but just a little toss that any youngster might have\ntossed. Of all possible balls, Lane was not expecting such as that, and\nhe let it go.  If the nerve of it amazed me, what did it not do to\nLane?  I saw his face go fiery red.  The grand stand murmured; let out\none short yelp of pleasure; the Quaker players chaffed Lane.\n\nThe pitch was a strike.  I was gripping my chair now, and for the next\npitch I prophesied the Rube's wonderful jump ball, which he had not yet\nused.  He swung long, and at the end of his swing seemed to jerk\ntensely.  I scarcely saw the ball. It had marvelous speed.  Lane did\nnot offer to hit it, and it was a strike.  He looked at the Rube, then\nat Cogswell.  That veteran appeared amused. The bleachers, happy and\nsurprised to be able to yell at Lane, yelled heartily.\n\nAgain I took it upon myself to interpret the Rube's pitching mind.  He\nhad another ball that he had not used, a drop, an unhittable drop.  I\nthought he would use that next.  He did, and though Lane reached it\nwith the bat, the hit was a feeble one.  He had been fooled and the\nside was out.\n\nPoole, the best of the Quaker's pitching staff, walked out to the slab.\nHe was a left-hander, and Chicago, having so many players who batted\nleft-handed, always found a southpaw a hard nut to crack.  Cogswell,\nfield manager and captain of the Quakers, kicked up the dust around\nfirst base and yelled to his men:  \"Git in the game!\"\n\nStaats hit Poole's speed ball into deep short and was out; Mitchell\nflew out to Berne; Rand grounded to second.\n\nWhile the teams again changed sides the fans cheered, and then indulged\nin the first stretch of the game.  I calculated that they would be\nstretching their necks presently, trying to keep track of the Rube's\nwork.  Nan leaned on the railing absorbed in her own hope and faith.\nMilly chattered about this and that, people in the boxes, and the\nchances of the game.\n\nMy own interest, while it did not wholly preclude the fortunes of the\nChicago players at the bat, was mostly concerned with the Rube's\nfortunes in the field.\n\nIn the Rube's half inning he retired Bannister and Blandy on feeble\ninfield grounders, and worked Cogswell into hitting a wide curve high\nin the air.\n\nPoole meant to win for the Quakers if his good arm and cunning did not\nfail him, and his pitching was masterly.  McCloskey fanned, Hutchinson\nfouled out, Brewster got a short safe fly just out of reach, and\nHoffner hit to second, forcing Brewster.\n\nWith Dugan up for the Quakers in the third inning, Cogswell and\nBannister, from the coaching lines, began to talk to the Rube.  My\nears, keen from long practice, caught some of the remarks in spite of\nthe noisy bleachers.\n\n\"Say, busher, you 've lasted longer'n we expected, but you don't know\nit!\"\n\n\"Gol darn you city ball tossers!  Now you jest let me alone!\"\n\n\"We're comin' through the rye!\"\n\n\"My top-heavy rustic friend, you'll need an airship presently, when you\ngo up!\"\n\nAll the badinage was good-natured, which was sure proof that the\nQuakers had not arrived at anything like real appreciation of the Rube.\nThey were accustomed to observe the trying out of many youngsters, of\nwhom ninety-nine out of a hundred failed to make good.\n\nDugan chopped at three strikes and slammed his bat down.  Hucker hit a\nslow fly to Hoffer. Three men out on five pitched balls!  Cogswell, old\nwar horse that he was, stood a full moment and watched the Rube as he\nwalked in to the bench.  An idea had penetrated Cogswell's brain, and I\nwould have given something to know what it was.  Cogswell was a great\nbaseball general, and though he had a preference for matured\nball-players he could, when pressed, see the quality in a youngster.\nHe picked up his mitt and took his position at first with a gruff word\nto his players.\n\nRand for Chicago opened with a hit, and the bleachers, ready to strike\nfire, began to cheer and stamp.  When McCloskey, in an attempt to\nsacrifice, beat out his bunt the crowd roared.  Rand, being slow on his\nfeet, had not attempted to make third on the play.  Hutchinson\nsacrificed, neatly advancing the runners.  Then the bleachers played\nthe long rolling drum of clattering feet with shrill whistling\naccompaniment.  Brewster batted a wicked ground ball to Blandy.  He\ndove into the dust, came up with the ball, and feinting to throw home\nhe wheeled and shot the ball to Cogswell, who in turn shot it to the\nplate to head Rand.  Runner and ball got there apparently together, but\nUmpire McClung's decision went against Rand.  It was fine, fast work,\nbut how the bleachers stormed at McClung!\n\n\"Rob-b-ber!\"\n\nAgain the head of the Quakers' formidable list was up.  I knew from the\nway that Cogswell paced the coaching box that the word had gone out to\nlook the Rube over seriously.  There were possibilities even in rubes.\n\nBerne carefully stepped into the batter's box, as if he wanted to be\ncertain to the breadth of a hair how close he was to the plate.  He was\nthere this time to watch the Rube pitch, to work him out, to see what\nwas what.  He crouched low, and it would have been extremely hard to\nguess what he was up to.  His great play, however, was his ability to\ndump the ball and beat out the throw to first.  It developed presently,\nthat this was now his intention and that the Rube knew it and pitched\nhim the one ball which is almost impossible to bunt--a high incurve,\nover the inside corner. There was no mistaking the Rube's magnificent\ncontrol.  True as a plumb line he shot up the ball--once, twice, and\nBerne fouled both--two strikes.  Grudgingly he waited on the next, but\nit, too, was over the corner, and Berne went out on strikes.  The great\ncrowd did not, of course, grasp the finesse of the play, but Berne had\nstruck out--that was enough for them.\n\nCallopy, the famous spiker, who had put many a player out of the game\nfor weeks at a time, strode into the batter's place, and he, too, was\nnot at the moment making any funny remarks.  The Rube delivered a ball\nthat all but hit Callopy fair on the head.  It was the second narrow\nescape for him, and the roar he let out showed how he resented being\nthreatened with a little of his own medicine.  As might have been\nexpected, and very likely as the Rube intended, Callopy hit the next\nball, a sweeping curve, up over the infield.\n\nI was trying to see all the intricate details of the motive and action\non the field, and it was not easy to watch several players at once.\nBut while Berne and Callopy were having their troubles with the Rube, I\nkept the tail of my eye on Cogswell.  He was prowling up and down the\nthird-base line.\n\nHe was missing no signs, no indications, no probabilities, no\npossibilities.  But he was in doubt.  Like a hawk he was watching the\nRube, and, as well, the crafty batters.  The inning might not tell the\ntruth as to the Rube's luck, though it would test his control.  The\nRube's speed and curves, without any head work, would have made him a\npitcher of no mean ability, but was this remarkable placing of balls\njust accident?  That was the question.\n\nWhen Berne walked to the bench I distinctly heard him say:  \"Come out\nof it, you dubs.  I say you can't work him or wait him.  He's peggin'\n'em out of a gun!\"\n\nSeveral of the Quakers were standing out from the bench, all intent on\nthe Rube.  He had stirred them up.  First it was humor; then ridicule,\ncuriosity, suspicion, doubt.  And I knew it would grow to wonder and\ncertainty, then fierce attack from both tongues and bats, and\nlastly--for ball players are generous--unstinted admiration.\n\nSomehow, not only the first climaxes of a game but the decisions, the\nconvictions, the reputations of pitchers and fielders evolve around the\ngreat hitter.  Plain it was that the vast throng of spectators, eager\nto believe in a new find, wild to welcome a new star, yet loath to\ntrust to their own impulsive judgments, held themselves in check until\nonce more the great Lane had faced the Rube.\n\nThe field grew tolerably quiet just then.  The Rube did not exert\nhimself.  The critical stage had no concern for him.  He pitched Lane a\nhigh curve, over the plate, but in close, a ball meant to be hit and a\nball hard to hit safely.  Lane knew that as well as any hitter in the\nworld, so he let two of the curves go by--two strikes.  Again the Rube\nrelentlessly gave him the same ball; and Lane, hitting viciously,\nspitefully, because he did not want to hit that kind of a ball, sent up\na fly that Rand easily captured.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know!  Pretty fair, I guess!\" yelled a tenor-voiced fan;\nand he struck the key-note.  And the bleachers rose to their feet and\ngave the Rube the rousing cheer of the brotherhood of fans.\n\nHoffer walked to first on a base on balls. Sweeney advanced him.  The\nRube sent up a giant fly to Callopy.  Then Staats hit safely, scoring\nthe first run of the game.  Hoffer crossed the plate amid vociferous\napplause.  Mitchell ended the inning with a fly to Blandy.\n\nWhat a change had come over the spirit of that Quaker aggregation!  It\nwas something to make a man thrill with admiration and, if he happened\nto favor Chicago, to fire all his fighting blood. The players poured\nupon the Rube a continuous stream of scathing abuse.  They would have\nmade a raging devil of a mild-mannered clergyman. Some of them were\nskilled in caustic wit, most of them were possessed of forked tongues;\nand Cogswell, he of a thousand baseball battles, had a genius for\ninflaming anyone he tormented.  This was mostly beyond the ken of the\naudience, and behind the back of the umpire, but it was perfectly plain\nto me.  The Quakers were trying to rattle the Rube, a trick of the game\nas fair for one side as for the other.  I sat there tight in my seat,\ngrimly glorying in the way the Rube refused to be disturbed.  But the\nlion in him was rampant. Fortunately, it was his strange gift to pitch\nbetter the angrier he got; and the more the Quakers flayed him, the\nmore he let himself out to their crushing humiliation.\n\nThe innings swiftly passed to the eighth with Chicago failing to score\nagain, with Philadelphia failing to score at all.  One scratch hit and\na single, gifts to the weak end of the batting list, were all the lank\npitcher allowed them.  Long since the bleachers had crowned the Rube.\nHe was theirs and they were his; and their voices had the peculiar\nstrangled hoarseness due to over-exertion. The grand stand, slower to\nunderstand and approve, arrived later; but it got there about the\nseventh, and ladies' gloves and men's hats were sacrificed.\n\nIn the eighth the Quakers reluctantly yielded their meed of praise,\nshowing it by a cessation of their savage wordy attacks on the Rube.\nIt was a kind of sullen respect, wrung from the bosom of great foes.\n\nThen the ninth inning was at hand.  As the sides changed I remembered\nto look at the feminine group in our box.  Milly was in a most\nbeautiful glow of happiness and excitement.  Nan sat rigid, leaning\nover the rail, her face white and drawn, and she kept saying in a low\nvoice: \"Will it never end?  Will it never end?\"  Mrs. Nelson stared\nwearily.\n\nIt was the Quakers' last stand.  They faced it as a team that had won\nmany a game in the ninth with two men out.  Dugan could do nothing with\nthe Rube's unhittable drop, for a drop curve was his weakness, and he\nstruck out.  Hucker hit to Hoffer, who fumbled, making the first error\nof the game.  Poole dumped the ball, as evidently the Rube desired, for\nhe handed up a straight one, but the bunt rolled teasingly and the\nRube, being big and tall, failed to field it in time.\n\nSuddenly the whole field grew quiet.  For the first time Cogswell's\ncoaching was clearly heard.\n\n\"One out!  Take a lead!  Take a lead!  Go through this time.  Go\nthrough!\"\n\nCould it be possible, I wondered, that after such a wonderful\nexhibition of pitching the Rube would lose out in the ninth?\n\nThere were two Quakers on base, one out, and two of the best hitters in\nthe league on deck, with a chance of Lane getting up.\n\n\"Oh!  Oh!  Oh!\" moaned Nan.\n\nI put my hand on hers.  \"Don't quit, Nan. You'll never forgive yourself\nif you quit.  Take it from me, Whit will pull out of this hole!\"\n\nWhat a hole that was for the Rube on the day of his break into fast\ncompany!  I measured it by his remarkable deliberation.  He took a long\ntime to get ready to pitch to Berne, and when he let drive it was as if\nhe had been trifling all before in that game.  I could think of no way\nto figure it except that when the ball left him there was scarcely any\nappreciable interval of time before it cracked in Sweeney's mitt.  It\nwas the Rube's drop, which I believed unhittable.  Berne let it go by,\nshaking his head as McClung called it a strike.  Another followed,\nwhich Berne chopped at vainly.  Then with the same upheaval of his\ngiant frame, the same flinging of long arms and lunging forward, the\nRube delivered a third drop. And Berne failed to hit it.\n\nThe voiceless bleachers stamped on the benches and the grand stand\nlikewise thundered.\n\nCallopy showed his craft by stepping back and lining Rube's high pitch\nto left.  Hoffer leaped across and plunged down, getting his gloved\nhand in front of the ball.  The hit was safe, but Hoffer's valiant\neffort saved a tie score.\n\nLane up!  Three men on bases!  Two out!\n\nNot improbably there were many thousand spectators of that thrilling\nmoment who pitied the Rube for the fate which placed Lane at the bat\nthen.  But I was not one of them.  Nevertheless my throat was clogged,\nmy mouth dry, and my ears full of bells.  I could have done something\nterrible to Hurtle for his deliberation, yet I knew he was proving\nhimself what I had always tried to train him to be.\n\nThen he swung, stepped out, and threw his body with the ball.  This was\nhis rarely used pitch, his last resort, his fast rise ball that jumped\nup a little at the plate.  Lane struck under it.  How significant on\nthe instant to see old Cogswell's hands go up!  Again the Rube pitched,\nand this time Lane watched the ball go by.  Two strikes!\n\nThat whole audience leaped to its feet, whispering, yelling, screaming,\nroaring, bawling.\n\nThe Rube received the ball from Sweeney and quick as lightning he sped\nit plateward.  The great Lane struck out!  The game was over--Chicago,\n1; Philadelphia, 0.\n\nIn that whirling moment when the crowd went mad and Milly was hugging\nme, and Nan pounding holes in my hat, I had a queer sort of blankness,\na section of time when my sensations were deadlocked.\n\n\"Oh!  Connie, look!\" cried Nan.  I saw Lane and Cogswell warmly shaking\nhands with the Rube.  Then the hungry clamoring fans tumbled upon the\nfield and swarmed about the players.\n\nWhereupon Nan kissed me and Milly, and then kissed Mrs. Nelson.  In\nthat radiant moment Nan was all sweetness.\n\n\"It is the Rube's break into fast company,\" she said.\n\n\n\nTHE KNOCKER\n\n\"Yes, Carroll, I got my notice.  Maybe it's no surprise to you.  And\nthere's one more thing I want to say.  You're 'it' on this team.\nYou're the topnotch catcher in the Western League and one of the best\nball players in the game--but you're a knocker!\"\n\nMadge Ellston heard young Sheldon speak. She saw the flash in his gray\neyes and the heat of his bronzed face as he looked intently at the big\ncatcher.\n\n\"Fade away, sonny.  Back to the bush-league for yours!\" replied\nCarroll, derisively.  \"You're not fast enough for Kansas City.  You\nlook pretty good in a uniform and you're swift on your feet, but you\ncan't hit.  You've got a glass arm and you run bases like an ostrich\ntrying to side.  That notice was coming to you.  Go learn the game!\"\n\nThen a crowd of players trooped noisily out of the hotel lobby and\nswept Sheldon and Carroll down the porch steps toward the waiting\nomnibus.\n\nMadge's uncle owned the Kansas City club. She had lived most of her\nnineteen years in a baseball atmosphere, but accustomed as she was to\nbaseball talk and the peculiar banterings and bickerings of the\nplayers, there were times when it seemed all Greek.  If a player got\nhis \"notice\" it meant he would be released in ten days.  A \"knocker\"\nwas a ball player who spoke ill of his fellow players.  This scrap of\nconversation, however, had an unusual interest because Carroll had paid\ncourt to her for a year, and Sheldon, coming to the team that spring,\nhad fallen desperately in love with her.  She liked Sheldon pretty\nwell, but Carroll fascinated her.  She began to wonder if there were\nbad feelings between the rivals--to compare them--to get away from\nherself and judge them impersonally.\n\nWhen Pat Donahue, the veteran manager of the team came out, Madge\ngreeted him with a smile.  She had always gotten on famously with Pat,\nnotwithstanding her imperious desire to handle the managerial reins\nherself upon occasions. Pat beamed all over his round ruddy face.\n\n\"Miss Madge, you weren't to the park yesterday an' we lost without our\npretty mascot.  We shure needed you.  Denver's playin' at a fast clip.\"\n\n\"I'm coming out today,\" replied Miss Ellston, thoughtfully.  \"Pat,\nwhat's a knocker?\"\n\n\"Now, Miss Madge, are you askin' me that after I've been coachin' you\nin baseball for years?\" questioned Pat, in distress.\n\n\"I know what a knocker is, as everybody else does.  But I want to know\nthe real meaning, the inside-ball of it, to use your favorite saying.\"\n\nStudying her grave face with shrewd eyes Donahue slowly lost his smile.\n\n\"The inside-ball of it, eh?  Come, let's sit over here a bit--the sun's\nshure warm today.... Miss Madge, a knocker is the strangest man\nknown in the game, the hardest to deal with an' what every baseball\nmanager hates most.\"\n\nDonahue told her that he believed the term \"knocker\" came originally\nfrom baseball; that in general it typified the player who strengthened\nhis own standing by belittling the ability of his team-mates, and by\nenlarging upon his own superior qualities.  But there were many phases\nof this peculiar type.  Some players were natural born knockers; others\nacquired the name in their later years in the game when younger men\nthreatened to win their places.  Some of the best players ever produced\nby baseball had the habit in its most violent form.  There were players\nof ridiculously poor ability who held their jobs on the strength of\nthis one trait.  It was a mystery how they misled magnates and managers\nalike; how for months they held their places, weakening a team, often\nkeeping a good team down in the race; all from sheer bold suggestion of\ntheir own worth and other players' worthlessness. Strangest of all was\nthe knockers' power to disorganize; to engender a bad spirit between\nmanagement and team and among the players. The team which was without\none of the parasites of the game generally stood well up in the race\nfor the pennant, though there had been championship teams noted for\ngreat knockers as well as great players.\n\n\"It's shure strange, Miss Madge,\" said Pat in conclusion, shaking his\ngray head.  \"I've played hundreds of knockers, an' released them, too.\nKnockers always get it in the end, but they go on foolin' me and\nworkin' me just the same as if I was a youngster with my first team.\nThey're part an' parcel of the game.\"\n\n\"Do you like these men off the field--outside of baseball, I mean?\"\n\n\"No, I shure don't, an' I never seen one yet that wasn't the same off\nthe field as he was on.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Pat.  I think I understand now. And--oh, yes, there's\nanother thing I want to ask you.  What's the matter with Billie\nSheldon? Uncle George said he was falling off in his game. Then I've\nread the papers.  Billie started out well in the spring.\"\n\n\"Didn't he?  I was sure thinkin' I had a find in Billie.  Well, he's\nlost his nerve.  He's in a bad slump.  It's worried me for days.  I'm\ngoin' to release Billie.  The team needs a shake-up. That's where\nBillie gets the worst of it, for he's really the makin' of a star; but\nhe's slumped, an' now knockin' has made him let down.  There, Miss\nMadge, that's an example of what I've just been tellin' you.  An' you\ncan see that a manager has his troubles.  These hulkin' athletes are a\nlot of spoiled babies an' I often get sick of my job.\"\n\nThat afternoon Miss Ellston was in a brown study all the way out to the\nbaseball park.  She arrived rather earlier than usual to find the\ngrand-stand empty.  The Denver team had just come upon the field, and\nthe Kansas City players were practising batting at the left of the\ndiamond. Madge walked down the aisle of the grand stand and out along\nthe reporters' boxes.  She asked one of the youngsters on the field to\ntell Mr. Sheldon that she would like to speak with him a moment.\n\nBillie eagerly hurried from the players' bench with a look of surprise\nand expectancy on his sun-tanned face.  Madge experienced for the first\ntime a sudden sense of shyness at his coming.  His lithe form and his\nnimble step somehow gave her a pleasure that seemed old yet was new.\nWhen he neared her, and, lifting his cap, spoke her name, the shade of\ngloom in his eyes and lines of trouble on his face dispelled her\nconfusion.\n\n\"Billie, Pat tells me he's given you ten days' notice,\" she said.\n\n\"It's true.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with you, Billie?\"\n\n\"Oh, I've struck a bad streak--can't hit or throw.\"\n\n\"Are you a quitter?\"\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" he answered quickly, flushing a dark red.\n\n\"You started off this spring with a rush.  You played brilliantly and\nfor a while led the team in batting.  Uncle George thought so well of\nyou. Then came this spell of bad form.  But, Billie, it's only a slump;\nyou can brace.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he replied, despondently. \"Awhile back I got my mind\noff the game.  Then--people who don't like me have taken advantage of\nmy slump to----\"\n\n\"To knock,\" interrupted Miss Ellston.\n\n\"I'm not saying that,\" he said, looking away from her.\n\n\"But I'm saying it.  See here, Billie Sheldon, my uncle owns this team\nand Pat Donahue is manager. I think they both like me a little.  Now I\ndon't want to see you lose your place.  Perhaps----\"\n\n\"Madge, that's fine of you--but I think--I guess it'd be best for me to\nleave Kansas City.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You know,\" he said huskily.  \"I've lost my head--I'm in love--I can't\nthink of baseball--I'm crazy about you.\"\n\nMiss Ellston's sweet face grew rosy, clear to the tips of her ears.\n\n\"Billie Sheldon,\" she replied, spiritedly. \"You're talking nonsense.\nEven if you were were that way, it'd be no reason to play poor ball.\nDon't throw the game, as Pat would say. Make a brace!  Get up on your\ntoes!  Tear things!  Rip the boards off the fence!  Don't quit!\"\n\nShe exhausted her vocabulary of baseball language if not her\nenthusiasm, and paused in blushing confusion.\n\n\"Madge!\"\n\n\"Will you brace up?\"\n\n\"Will I--will I!\" he exclaimed, breathlessly.\n\nMadge murmured a hurried good-bye and, turning away, went up the\nstairs.  Her uncle's private box was upon the top of the grand stand\nand she reached it in a somewhat bewildered state of mind.  She had a\nconfused sense of having appeared to encourage Billie, and did not know\nwhether she felt happy or guilty.  The flame in his eyes had warmed all\nher blood.  Then, as she glanced over the railing to see the powerful\nBurns Carroll, there rose in her breast a panic at strange variance\nwith her other feelings.\n\nMany times had Madge Ellston viewed the field and stands and the\noutlying country from this high vantage point; but never with the same\nmingling emotions, nor had the sunshine ever been so golden, the woods\nand meadows so green, the diamond so smooth and velvety, the whole\nscene so gaily bright.\n\nDenver had always been a good drawing card, and having won the first\ngame of the present series, bade fair to draw a record attendance. The\nlong lines of bleachers, already packed with the familiar mottled\ncrowd, sent forth a merry, rattling hum.  Soon a steady stream of\nwell-dressed men and women poured in the gates and up the grand-stand\nstairs.  The soft murmur of many voices in light conversation and\nlaughter filled the air.  The peanut venders and score-card sellers\nkept up their insistent shrill cries.  The baseball park was alive now\nand restless; the atmosphere seemed charged with freedom and pleasure.\nThe players romped like skittish colts, the fans shrieked their\nwitticisms--all sound and movements suggested play.\n\nMadge Ellston was somehow relieved to see her uncle sitting in one of\nthe lower boxes.  During this game she wanted to be alone, and she\nbelieved she would be, for the President of the League and directors of\nthe Kansas City team were with her uncle.  When the bell rang to call\nthe Denver team in from practice the stands could hold no more, and the\nroped-off side lines were filling up with noisy men and boys.  From her\nseat Madge could see right down upon the players' bench, and when she\ncaught both Sheldon and Carroll gazing upward she drew back with\nsharply contrasted thrills.\n\nThen the bell rang again, the bleachers rolled out their welcoming\nacclaim, and play was called with Kansas City at the bat.\n\nRight off the reel Hunt hit a short fly safely over second.  The ten\nthousand spectators burst into a roar.  A good start liberated applause\nand marked the feeling for the day.\n\nMadge was surprised and glad to see Billie Sheldon start next for the\nplate.  All season, until lately, he had been the second batter.\nDuring his slump he had been relegated to the last place on the batting\nlist.  Perhaps he had asked Pat to try him once more at the top.  The\nbleachers voiced their unstinted appreciation of this return, showing\nthat Billie still had a strong hold on their hearts.\n\nAs for Madge, her breast heaved and she had difficulty in breathing.\nThis was going to be a hard game for her.  The intensity of her desire\nto see Billie brace up to his old form amazed her. And Carroll's rude\nwords beat thick in her ears. Never before had Billie appeared so\ninstinct with life, so intent and strung as when he faced Keene, the\nDenver pitcher.  That worthy tied himself up in a knot, and then,\nunlimbering a long arm, delivered the brand new ball.\n\nBillie seemed to leap forward and throw his bat at it.  There was a\nsharp ringing crack--and the ball was like a white string marvelously\nstretching out over the players, over the green field beyond, and then,\nsailing, soaring, over the right-field fence.  For a moment the stands,\neven the bleachers, were stone quiet.  No player had ever hit a ball\nover that fence.  It had been deemed impossible, as was attested to by\nthe many painted \"ads\" offering prizes for such a feat.  Suddenly the\nfar end of the bleachers exploded and the swelling roar rolled up to\nengulf the grand stand in thunder.  Billie ran round the bases to\napplause never before vented on that field.  But he gave no sign that\nit affected him; he did not even doff his cap.  White-faced and stern,\nhe hurried to the bench, where Pat fell all over him and many of the\nplayers grasped his hands.\n\nUp in her box Madge was crushing her score-card and whispering:  \"Oh!\nBillie, I could hug you for that!\"\n\nTwo runs on two pitched balls!  That was an opening to stir an exacting\naudience to the highest pitch of enthusiasm.  The Denver manager\nperemptorily called Keene off the diamond and sent in Steele, a\nsouth-paw, who had always bothered Pat's left-handed hitters.  That\nmove showed his astute judgment, for Steele struck out McReady and\nretired Curtis and Mahew on easy chances.\n\nIt was Dalgren's turn to pitch and though he had shown promise in\nseveral games he had not yet been tried out on a team of Denver's\nstrength. The bleachers gave him a good cheering as he walked into the\nbox, but for all that they whistled their wonder at Pat's assurance in\nputting him against the Cowboys in an important game.\n\nThe lad was visibly nervous and the hard-hitting and loud-coaching\nDenver players went after him as if they meant to drive him out of the\ngame.  Crane stung one to left center for a base, Moody was out on a\nliner to short, almost doubling up Crane; the fleet-footed Bluett\nbunted and beat the throw to first; Langly drove to left for what\nseemed a three-bagger, but Curtis, after a hard run, caught the ball\nalmost off the left-field bleachers.  Crane and Bluett advanced a base\non the throw-in.  Then Kane batted up a high foul-fly. Burns Carroll,\nthe Kansas City catcher, had the reputation of being a fiend for\nchasing foul flies, and he dashed at this one with a speed that\nthreatened a hard fall over the players' bench or a collision with the\nfence.  Carroll caught the ball and crashed against the grand stand,\nbut leaped back with an agility that showed that if there was any harm\ndone it had not been to him.\n\nThus the sharp inning ended with a magnificent play.  It electrified\nthe spectators into a fierce energy of applause.  With one accord, by\nbaseball instinct, the stands and bleachers and roped-in-sidelines\nrealized it was to be a game of games and they answered to the stimulus\nwith a savage enthusiasm that inspired ballplayers to great plays.\n\nIn the first half of the second inning, Steele's will to do and his arm\nto execute were very like his name.  Kansas City could not score.  In\ntheir half the Denver team made one run by clean hitting.\n\nThen the closely fought advantage see-sawed from one team to the other.\nIt was not a pitchers' battle, though both men worked to the limit of\nskill and endurance.  They were hit hard.  Dazzling plays kept the\nscore down and the innings short.  Over the fields hung the portent of\nsomething to come, every player, every spectator felt the subtle\nbaseball chance; each inning seemed to lead closer and more thrillingly\nup to the climax.  But at the end of the seventh, with the score tied\nsix and six, with daring steals, hard hits and splendid plays, enough\nto have made memorable several games, it seemed that the great\nportentous moment was still in abeyance.\n\nThe head of the batting list for Kansas City was up.  Hunt caught the\nfirst pitched ball squarely on the end of his bat.  It was a mighty\ndrive and as the ball soared and soared over the center-field Hunt\nraced down the base line, and the winged-footed Crane sped outward, the\nbleachers split their throats.  The hit looked good for a home run, but\nCrane leaped up and caught the ball in his gloved hand.  The sudden\nsilence and then the long groan which racked the bleachers was greater\ntribute to Crane's play than any applause.\n\nBillie Sheldon then faced Steele.  The fans roared hoarsely, for Billie\nhad hit safely three times out of four.  Steele used his curve ball,\nbut he could not get the batter to go after it.  When he had wasted\nthree balls, the never-despairing bleachers howled:  \"Now, Billie, in\nyour groove! Sting the next one!\"  But Billie waited.  One strike!  Two\nstrikes!  Steele cut the plate.  That was a test which proved Sheldon's\ncaliber.\n\nWith seven innings of exciting play passed, with both teams on edge,\nwith the bleachers wild and the grand stands keyed up to the breaking\npoint, with everything making deliberation almost impossible, Billie\nSheldon had remorselessly waited for three balls and two strikes.\n\n\"Now! ...  Now! ...  Now!\" shrieked the bleachers.\n\nSteele had not tired nor lost his cunning.  With hands before him he\ngrimly studied Billie, then whirling hard to get more weight into his\nmotion, he threw the ball.\n\nBillie swung perfectly and cut a curving liner between the first\nbaseman and the base.  Like a shot it skipped over the grass out along\nthe foul-line into right field.  Amid tremendous uproar Billie\nstretched the hit into a triple, and when he got up out of the dust\nafter his slide into third the noise seemed to be the crashing down of\nthe bleachers.  It died out with the choking gurgling yell of the most\nleather-lunged fan.\n\n\"O-o-o-o-you-Billie-e!\"\n\nMcReady marched up and promptly hit a long fly to the redoubtable\nCrane.  Billie crouched in a sprinter's position with his eye on the\ngraceful fielder, waiting confidently for the ball to drop. As if there\nhad not already been sufficient heart-rending moments, the chance that\ngoverned baseball meted out this play; one of the keenest, most trying\nknown to the game.  Players waited, spectators waited, and the instant\nof that dropping ball was interminably long.  Everybody knew Crane\nwould catch it; everybody thought of the wonderful throwing arm that\nhad made him famous.  Was it possible for Billie Sheldon to beat the\nthrow to the plate?\n\nCrane made the catch and got the ball away at the same instant Sheldon\nleaped from the base and dashed for home.  Then all eyes were on the\nball.  It seemed incredible that a ball thrown by human strength could\nspeed plateward so low, so straight, so swift.  But it lost its force\nand slanted down to bound into the catcher's hands just as Billie slid\nover the plate.\n\nBy the time the bleachers had stopped stamping and bawling, Curtis\nended the inning with a difficult grounder to the infield.\n\nOnce more the Kansas City players took the field and Burns Carroll sang\nout in his lusty voice: \"Keep lively, boys!  Play hard!  Dig 'em up an'\nget 'em!\"  Indeed the big catcher was the main-stay of the home team.\nThe bulk of the work fell upon his shoulders.  Dalgren was wild and\nkept his catcher continually blocking low pitches and wide curves and\npoorly controlled high fast balls. But they were all alike to Carroll.\nDespite his weight, he was as nimble on his feet as a goat, and if he\nonce got his hands on the ball he never missed it.  It was his\nencouragement that steadied Dalgren; his judgment of hitters that\ncarried the young pitcher through dangerous places; his lightning swift\ngrasp of points that directed the machine-like work of his team.\n\nIn this inning Carroll exhibited another of his demon chases after a\nfoul fly; he threw the base-stealing Crane out at second, and by a\nremarkable leap and stop of McReady's throw, he blocked a runner who\nwould have tied the score.\n\nThe Cowboys blanked their opponents in the first half of the ninth, and\ntrotted in for their turn needing one run to tie, two runs to win.\n\nThere had scarcely been a breathing spell for the onlookers in this\nrapid-fire game.  Every inning had held them, one moment breathless,\nthe next wildly clamorous, and another waiting in numb fear.  What did\nthese last few moments hold in store?  The only answer to that was the\ndogged plugging optimism of the Denver players. To listen to them, to\nwatch them, was to gather the impression that baseball fortune always\nfavored them in the end.\n\n\"Only three more, Dal.  Steady boys, it's our game,\" rolled out\nCarroll's deep bass.  How virile he was!  What a tower of strength to\nthe weakening pitcher!\n\nBut valiantly as Dalgren tried to respond, he failed.  The grind--the\nstrain had been too severe. When he finally did locate the plate Bluett\nhit safely.  Langley bunted along the base line and beat the ball.\n\nA blank, dead quiet settled down over the bleachers and stands.\nSomething fearful threatened. What might not come to pass, even at the\nlast moment of this nerve-racking game?  There was a runner on first\nand a runner on second. That was bad.  Exceedingly bad was it that\nthese runners were on base with nobody out.  Worst of all was the fact\nthat Kane was up.  Kane, the best bunter, the fastest man to first, the\nhardest hitter in the league!  That he would fail to advance those two\nrunners was scarcely worth consideration.  Once advanced, a fly to the\noutfield, a scratch, anything almost, would tie the score. So this was\nthe climax presaged so many times earlier in the game.  Dalgren seemed\nto wilt under it.\n\nKane swung his ash viciously and called on Dalgren to put one over.\nDalgren looked in toward the bench as if he wanted and expected to be\ntaken out.  But Pat Donahue made no sign. Pat had trained many a\npitcher by forcing him to take his medicine.  Then Carroll, mask under\nhis arm, rolling his big hand in his mitt, sauntered down to the\npitcher's box.  The sharp order of the umpire in no wise disconcerted\nhim.  He said something to Dalgren, vehemently nodding his head the\nwhile.  Players and audience alike supposed he was trying to put a\nlittle heart into Dalgren, and liked him the better, notwithstanding\nthe opposition to the umpire.\n\nCarroll sauntered back to his position.  He adjusted his breast\nprotector, and put on his mask, deliberately taking his time.  Then he\nstepped behind the plate, and after signing for the pitch, he slowly\nmoved his right hand up to his mask.\n\nDalgren wound up, took his swing, and let drive. Even as he delivered\nthe ball Carroll bounded away from his position, flinging off the mask\nas he jumped.  For a single fleeting instant, the catcher's position\nwas vacated.  But that instant was long enough to make the audience\ngasp.  Kane bunted beautifully down the third base line, and there\nCarroll stood, fifteen feet from the plate, agile as a huge monkey.  He\nwhipped the ball to Mahew at third.  Mahew wheeled quick as thought and\nlined the ball to second.  Sheldon came tearing for the bag, caught the\nball on the run, and with a violent stop and wrench threw it like a\nbullet to first base.  Fast as Kane was, the ball beat him ten feet.  A\ntriple play!\n\nThe players of both teams cheered, but the audience, slower to grasp\nthe complex and intricate points, needed a long moment to realize what\nhad happened.  They needed another to divine that Carroll had\nanticipated Kane's intention to bunt, had left his position as the ball\nwas pitched, had planned all, risked all, played all on Kane's sure\neye; and so he had retired the side and won the game by creating and\nexecuting the rarest play in baseball.\n\nThen the audience rose in a body to greet the great catcher.  What a\nhoarse thundering roar shook the stands and waved in a blast over the\nfield!  Carroll stood bowing his acknowledgment, and then swaggered a\nlittle with the sun shining on his handsome heated face.  Like a\nconqueror conscious of full blown power he stalked away to the\nclubhouse.\n\nMadge Ellston came out of her trance and viewed the ragged score-card,\nher torn parasol, her battered gloves and flying hair, her generally\ndisheveled state with a little start of dismay, but when she got into\nthe thick and press of the moving crowd she found all the women more or\nless disheveled.  And they seemed all the prettier and friendlier for\nthat.  It was a happy crowd and voices were conspicuously hoarse.\n\nWhen Madge entered the hotel parlor that evening she found her uncle\nwith guests and among them was Burns Carroll.  The presence of the\nhandsome giant affected Madge more impellingly than ever before, yet in\nsome inexplicably different way.  She found herself trembling; she\nsensed a crisis in her feelings for this man and it frightened her.\nShe became conscious suddenly that she had always been afraid of him.\nWatching Carroll receive the congratulations of many of those present,\nshe saw that he dominated them as he had her.  His magnetism was\nover-powering; his great stature seemed to fill the room; his easy\ncareless assurance emanated from superior strength.  When he spoke\nlightly of the game, of Crane's marvelous catch, of Dalgren's pitching\nand of his own triple play, it seemed these looming features retreated\nin perspective--somehow lost their vital significance because he\nslighted them.\n\nIn the light of Carroll's illuminating talk, in the remembrance of\nSheldon's bitter denunciation, in the knowledge of Pat Donahue's\nestimate of a peculiar type of ball-player, Madge Ellston found herself\njudging the man--bravely trying to resist his charm, to be fair to him\nand to herself.\n\nCarroll soon made his way to her side and greeted her with his old\nfamiliar manner of possession.  However irritating it might be to Madge\nwhen alone, now it held her bound.\n\nCarroll possessed the elemental attributes of a conqueror.  When with\nhim Madge whimsically feared that he would snatch her up in his arms\nand carry her bodily off, as the warriors of old did with the women\nthey wanted.  But she began to believe that the fascination he\nexercised upon her was merely physical.  That gave her pause. Not only\nwas Burns Carroll on trial, but also a very foolish fluttering little\nmoth--herself.  It was time enough, however, to be stern with herself\nafter she had tried him.\n\n\"Wasn't that a splendid catch of Crane's today?\" she asked.\n\n\"A lucky stab!  Crane has a habit of running round like an ostrich and\nsticking out a hand to catch a ball.  It's a grand-stand play.  Why, a\ngood outfielder would have been waiting under that fly.\"\n\n\"Dalgren did fine work in the box, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Oh, the kid's all right with an old head back of the plate.  He's\nwild, though, and will never make good in fast company.  I won his game\ntoday. He wouldn't have lasted an inning without me.  It was dead wrong\nfor Pat to pitch him. Dalgren simply can't pitch and he hasn't sand\nenough to learn.\"\n\nA hot retort trembled upon Madge Ellston's lips, but she withheld it\nand quietly watched Carroll.  How complacent he was, how utterly\nself-contained!\n\n\"And Billie Sheldon--wasn't it good to see him brace?  What hitting! .\n..  That home run!\"\n\n\"Sheldon flashed up today.  That's the worst of such players.  This\ntalk of his slump is all rot. When he joined the team he made some\nlucky hits and the papers lauded him as a comer, but he soon got down\nto his real form.  Why, to break into a game now and then, to shut his\neyes and hit a couple on the nose--that's not baseball. Pat's given him\nten days' notice, and his release will be a good move for the team.\nSheldon's not fast enough for this league.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.  He seemed so promising,\" replied Madge.  \"I liked\nBilly--pretty well.\"\n\n\"Yes, that was evident,\" said Carroll, firing up.  \"I never could\nunderstand what you saw in him.  Why, Sheldon's no good.  He----\"\n\nMadge turned a white face that silenced Carroll.  She excused herself\nand returned to the parlor, where she had last seen her uncle.  Not\nfinding him there, she went into the long corridor and met Sheldon,\nDalgren and two more of the players.  Madge congratulated the young\npitcher and the other players on their brilliant work; and they, not to\nbe outdone, gallantly attributed the day's victory to her presence at\nthe game.  Then, without knowing in the least how it came about, she\npresently found herself alone with Billy, and they were strolling into\nthe music-room.\n\n\"Madge, did I brace up?\"\n\nThe girl risked one quick look at him.  How boyish he seemed, how\neager!  What an altogether different Billie!  But was the difference\nall in him!  Somehow, despite a conscious shyness in the moment she\nfelt natural and free, without the uncertainty and restraint that had\nalways troubled her while with him.\n\n\"Oh, Billie, that glorious home run!\"\n\n\"Madge, wasn't that hit a dandy?  How I made it is a mystery, but the\nbat felt like a feather.  I thought of you.  Tell me--what did you\nthink when I hit that ball over the fence?\"\n\n\"Billie, I'll never, never tell you.\"\n\n\"Yes--please--I want to know.  Didn't you think something--nice of me?\"\n\nThe pink spots in Madge's cheeks widened to crimson flames.\n\n\"Billie, are you still--crazy about me?  Now, don't come so close.\nCan't you behave yourself? And don't break my fingers with you terrible\nbaseball hands....  Well, when you made that hit I just collapsed\nand I said----\"\n\n\"Say it!  Say it!\" implored Billie.\n\nShe lowered her face and then bravely raised it.\n\n\"I said, 'Billie, I could hug you for that!' ... Billie, let me go!\nOh, you mustn't!--please!\"\n\nQuite a little while afterward Madge remembered to tell Billie that she\nhad been seeking her uncle.  They met him and Pat Donahue, coming out\nof the parlor.\n\n\"Where have you been all evening?\" demanded Mr. Ellston.\n\n\"Shure it looks as if she's signed a new manager,\" said Pat, his shrewd\neyes twinkling.\n\nThe soft glow in Madge's cheeks deepened into tell-tale scarlet; Billie\nresembled a schoolboy stricken in guilt.\n\n\"Aha! so that's it?\" queried her uncle.\n\n\"Ellston,\" said Pat.  \"Billie's home-run drive today recalled his\nnotice an' if I don't miss guess it won him another game--the best game\nin life.\"\n\n\"By George!\" exclaimed Mr. Ellston.  \"I was afraid it was Carroll!\"\n\nHe led Madge away and Pat followed with Billie.\n\n\"Shure, it was good to see you brace, Billie,\" said the manager, with a\nkindly hand on the young man's arm.  \"I'm tickled to death.  That ten\ndays' notice doesn't go.  See?  I've had to shake up the team but your\njob is good.  I released McReady outright an' traded Carroll to Denver\nfor a catcher and a fielder.  Some of the directors hollered murder,\nan' I expect the fans will roar, but I'm running this team, I'll have\nharmony among my players.  Carroll is a great catcher, but he's a\nknocker.\"\n\n\n\nTHE WINNING BALL\n\nOne day in July our Rochester club, leader in the Eastern League, had\nreturned to the hotel after winning a double-header from the Syracuse\nclub.  For some occult reason there was to be a lay-off next day and\nthen on the following another double-header.  These double-headers we\nhated next to exhibition games.  Still a lay-off for twenty-four hours,\nat that stage of the race, was a Godsend, and we received the news with\nexclamations of pleasure.\n\nAfter dinner we were all sitting and smoking comfortably in front of\nthe hotel when our manager, Merritt, came hurriedly out of the lobby.\nIt struck me that he appeared a little flustered.\n\n\"Say, you fellars,\" he said brusquely.  \"Pack your suits and be ready\nfor the bus at seven-thirty.\"\n\nFor a moment there was a blank, ominous silence, while we assimilated\nthe meaning of his terse speech.\n\n\"I've got a good thing on for tomorrow,\" continued the manager.  \"Sixty\nper cent gate receipts if we win.  That Guelph team is hot stuff,\nthough.\"\n\n\"Guelph!\" exclaimed some of the players suspiciously.  \"Where's Guelph?\"\n\n\"It's in Canada.  We'll take the night express an' get there tomorrow\nin time for the game. An' we'll hev to hustle.\"\n\nUpon Merritt then rained a multiplicity of excuses.  Gillinger was not\nwell, and ought to have that day's rest.  Snead's eyes would profit by\na lay-off.  Deerfoot Browning was leading the league in base running,\nand as his legs were all bruised and scraped by sliding, a manager who\nwas not an idiot would have a care of such valuable runmakers for his\nteam.  Lake had \"Charley-horse.\"  Hathaway's arm was sore.  Bane's\nstomach threatened gastritis.  Spike Doran's finger needed a chance to\nheal.  I was stale, and the other players, three pitchers, swore their\narms should be in the hospital.\n\n\"Cut it out!\" said Merritt, getting exasperated. \"You'd all lay down on\nme--now, wouldn't you?  Well, listen to this:  McDougal pitched today;\nhe doesn't go.  Blake works Friday, he doesn't go.  But the rest of you\npuffed-up, high-salaried stiffs pack your grips quick.  See?  It'll\ncost any fresh fellar fifty for missin' the train.\"\n\nSo that was how eleven of the Rochester team found themselves moodily\nboarding a Pullman en route for Buffalo and Canada.  We went to bed\nearly and arose late.\n\nGuelph lay somewhere in the interior of Canada, and we did not expect\nto get there until 1 o'clock.\n\nAs it turned out, the train was late; we had to dress hurriedly in the\nsmoking room, pack our citizen clothes in our grips and leave the train\nto go direct to the ball grounds without time for lunch.\n\nIt was a tired, dusty-eyed, peevish crowd of ball players that climbed\ninto a waiting bus at the little station.\n\nWe had never heard of Guelph; we did not care anything about Rube\nbaseball teams.  Baseball was not play to us; it was the hardest kind\nof work, and of all things an exhibition game was an abomination.\n\nThe Guelph players, strapping lads, met us with every mark of respect\nand courtesy and escorted us to the field with a brass band that was\nloud in welcome, if not harmonious in tune.\n\nSome 500 men and boys trotted curiously along with us, for all the\nworld as if the bus were a circus parade cage filled with striped\ntigers. What a rustic, motley crowd massed about in and on that ball\nground.  There must have been 10,000.\n\nThe audience was strange to us.  The Indians, half-breeds,\nFrench-Canadians; the huge, hulking, bearded farmers or traders, or\ntrappers, whatever they were, were new to our baseball experience.\n\nThe players themselves, however, earned the largest share of our\nattention.  By the time they had practiced a few moments we looked at\nMerritt and Merritt looked at us.\n\nThese long, powerful, big-handed lads evidently did not know the\ndifference between lacrosse and baseball; but they were quick as cats\non their feet, and they scooped up the ball in a way wonderful to see.\nAnd throw!--it made a professional's heart swell just to see them line\nthe ball across the diamond.\n\n\"Lord! what whips these lads have!\" exclaimed Merritt.  \"Hope we're not\nup against it. If this team should beat us we wouldn't draw a handful\nat Toronto.  We can't afford to be beaten. Jump around and cinch the\ngame quick.  If we get in a bad place, I'll sneak in the 'rabbit.'\"\n\nThe \"rabbit\" was a baseball similar in appearance to the ordinary\nleague ball; under its horse-hide cover, however, it was remarkably\ndifferent.\n\nAn ingenious fan, a friend of Merritt, had removed the covers from a\nnumber of league balls and sewed them on rubber balls of his own\nmaking. They could not be distinguished from the regular article, not\neven by an experienced professional--until they were hit.  Then!  The\nfact that after every bounce one of these rubber balls bounded swifter\nand higher had given it the name of the \"rabbit.\"\n\nMany a game had the \"rabbit\" won for us at critical stages.  Of course\nit was against the rules of the league, and of course every player in\nthe league knew about it; still, when it was judiciously and cleverly\nbrought into a close game, the \"rabbit\" would be in play, and very\nprobably over the fence, before the opposing captain could learn of it,\nlet alone appeal to the umpire.\n\n\"Fellars, look at that guy who's goin' to pitch,\" suddenly spoke up one\nof the team.\n\nMany as were the country players whom we seasoned and traveled\nprofessionals had run across, this twirler outclassed them for\nremarkable appearance.  Moreover, what put an entirely different tinge\nto our momentary humor was the discovery that he was as wild as a March\nhare and could throw a ball so fast that it resembled a pea shot from a\nboy's air gun.\n\nDeerfoot led our batting list, and after the first pitched ball, which\nhe did not see, and the second, which ticked his shirt as it shot past,\nhe turned to us with an expression that made us groan inwardly.\n\nWhen Deerfoot looked that way it meant the pitcher was dangerous.\nDeerfoot made no effort to swing at the next ball, and was promptly\ncalled out on strikes.\n\nI was second at bat, and went up with some reluctance.  I happened to\nbe leading the league in both long distance and safe hitting, and I\ndoted on speed.  But having stopped many mean in-shoots with various\nparts of my anatomy, I was rather squeamish about facing backwoods yaps\nwho had no control.\n\nWhen I had watched a couple of his pitches, which the umpire called\nstrikes, I gave him credit for as much speed as Rusie.  These balls\nwere as straight as a string, singularly without curve, jump, or\nvariation of any kind.  I lined the next one so hard at the shortstop\nthat it cracked like a pistol as it struck his hands and whirled him\nhalf off his feet.  Still he hung to the ball and gave opportunity for\nthe first crash of applause.\n\n\"Boys, he's a trifle wild,\" I said to my team-mates, \"but he has the\nmost beautiful ball to hit you ever saw.  I don't believe he uses a\ncurve, and when we once time that speed we'll kill it.\"\n\nNext inning, after old man Hathaway had baffled the Canadians with his\nwide, tantalizing curves, my predictions began to be verified.  Snead\nrapped one high and far to deep right field.  To our infinite surprise,\nhowever, the right fielder ran with fleetness that made our own\nDeerfoot seem slow, and he got under the ball and caught it.\n\nDoran sent a sizzling grasscutter down toward left.  The lanky third\nbaseman darted over, dived down, and, coming up with the ball,\nexhibited the power of a throwing arm that made as all green with envy.\n\nThen, when the catcher chased a foul fly somewhere back in the crowd\nand caught it, we began to take notice.\n\n\"Lucky stabs!\" said Merritt cheerfully.  \"They can't keep that up.\nWe'll drive him to the woods next time.\"\n\nBut they did keep it up; moreover, they became more brilliant as the\ngame progressed.  What with Hathaway's heady pitching we soon disposed\nof them when at the bat; our turns, however, owing to the wonderful\nfielding of these backwoodsmen, were also fruitless.\n\nMerritt, with his mind ever on the slice of gate money coming if we\nwon, began to fidget and fume and find fault.\n\n\"You're a swell lot of champions, now, ain't you?\" he observed between\ninnings.\n\nAll baseball players like to bat, and nothing pleases them so much as\nbase hits; on the other hand, nothing is quite so painful as to send\nout hard liners only to see them caught.  And it seemed as if every man\non our team connected with that lanky twirler's fast high ball and hit\nwith the force that made the bat spring only to have one of these rubes\nget his big hands upon it.\n\nConsidering that we were in no angelic frame of mind before the game\nstarted, and in view of Merritt's persistently increasing ill humor,\nthis failure of ours to hit a ball safely gradually worked us into a\nkind of frenzy.  From indifference we passed to determination, and from\nthat to sheer passionate purpose.\n\nLuck appeared to be turning in the sixth inning. With one out, Lake hit\na beauty to right.  Doran beat an infield grounder and reached first.\nHathaway struck out.\n\nWith Browning up and me next, the situation looked rather precarious\nfor the Canadians.\n\n\"Say, Deerfoot,\" whispered Merritt, \"dump one down the third-base line.\nHe's playin' deep. It's a pipe.  Then the bases will be full an'\nReddy'll clean up.\"\n\nIn a stage like that Browning was a man absolutely to depend upon.  He\nplaced a slow bunt in the grass toward third and sprinted for first.\nThe third baseman fielded the ball, but, being confused, did not know\nwhere to throw it.\n\n\"Stick it in your basket,\" yelled Merritt, in a delight that showed how\nhard he was pulling for the gate money, and his beaming smile as he\nturned to me was inspiring.  \"Now, Reddy, it's up to you!  I'm not\nworrying about what's happened so far.  I know, with you at bat in a\npinch, it's all off!\"\n\nMerritt's compliment was pleasing, but it did not augment my purpose,\nfor that already had reached the highest mark.  Love of hitting, if no\nother thing, gave me the thrilling fire to arise to the opportunity.\nSelecting my light bat, I went up and faced the rustic twirler and\nsoftly said things to him.\n\nHe delivered the ball, and I could have yelled aloud, so fast, so\nstraight, so true it sped toward me.  Then I hit it harder than I had\never hit a ball in my life.  The bat sprung, as if it were whalebone.\nAnd the ball took a bullet course between center and left.  So\nbeautiful a hit was it that I watched as I ran.\n\nOut of the tail of my eye I saw the center fielder running.  When I\nrounded first base I got a good look at this fielder, and though I had\nseen the greatest outfielders the game ever produced, I never saw one\nthat covered ground so swiftly as he.\n\nOn the ball soared, and began to drop; on the fielder sped, and began\nto disappear over a little hill back of his position.  Then he reached\nup with a long arm and marvelously caught the ball in one hand.  He\nwent out of sight as I touched second base, and the heterogeneous crowd\nknew about a great play to make more noise than a herd of charging\nbuffalo.\n\nIn the next half inning our opponents, by clean drives, scored two runs\nand we in our turn again went out ignominiously.  When the first of the\neighth came we were desperate and clamored for the \"rabbit.\"\n\n\"I've sneaked it in,\" said Merritt, with a low voice.  \"Got it to the\numpire on the last passed ball.  See, the pitcher's got it now.  Boys,\nit's all off but the fireworks!  Now, break loose!\"\n\nA peculiarity about the \"rabbit\" was the fact that though it felt as\nlight as the regulation league ball it could not be thrown with the\nsame speed and to curve it was an impossibility.\n\nBane hit the first delivery from our hoosier stumbling block.  The ball\nstruck the ground and began to bound toward short.  With every bound it\nwent swifter, longer and higher, and it bounced clear over the\nshortstop's head.  Lake chopped one in front of the plate, and it\nrebounded from the ground straight up so high that both runners were\nsafe before it came down.\n\nDoran hit to the pitcher.  The ball caromed his leg, scooted fiendishly\nat the second baseman, and tried to run up all over him like a tame\nsquirrel.  Bases full!\n\nHathaway got a safe fly over the infield and two runs tallied.  The\npitcher, in spite of the help of the umpire, could not locate the plate\nfor Balknap, and gave him a base on balls.  Bases full again!\n\nDeerfoot slammed a hot liner straight at the second baseman, which,\nstriking squarely in his hands, recoiled as sharply as if it had struck\na wall.  Doran scored, and still the bases were filled.\n\nThe laboring pitcher began to get rattled; he could not find his usual\nspeed; he knew it, but evidently could not account for it.\n\nWhen I came to bat, indications were not wanting that the Canadian team\nwould soon be up in the air.  The long pitcher delivered the \"rabbit,\"\nand got it low down by my knees, which was an unfortunate thing for\nhim.  I swung on that one, and trotted round the bases behind the\nrunners while the center and left fielders chased the ball.\n\nGillinger weighed nearly two hundred pounds, and he got all his weight\nunder the \"rabbit.\"  It went so high that we could scarcely see it.\nAll the infielders rushed in, and after staggering around, with heads\nbent back, one of them, the shortstop, managed to get under it.  The\n\"rabbit\" bounded forty feet out of his hands!\n\nWhen Snead's grounder nearly tore the third baseman's leg off; when\nBane's hit proved as elusive as a flitting shadow; when Lake's liner\nknocked the pitcher flat, and Doran's fly leaped high out of the center\nfielder's glove--then those earnest, simple, country ballplayers\nrealized something was wrong.  But they imagined it was in themselves,\nand after a short spell of rattles, they steadied up and tried harder\nthan ever.  The motions they went through trying to stop that jumping\njackrabbit of a ball were ludicrous in the extreme.\n\nFinally, through a foul, a short fly, and a scratch hit to first, they\nretired the side and we went into the field with the score 14 to 2 in\nour favor.\n\nBut Merritt had not found it possible to get the \"rabbit\" out of play!\n\nWe spent a fatefully anxious few moments squabbling with the umpire and\ncaptain over the \"rabbit.\"  At the idea of letting those herculean\nrailsplitters have a chance to hit the rubber ball we felt our blood\nrun cold.\n\n\"But this ball has a rip in it,\" blustered Gillinger.  He lied\natrociously.  A microscope could not have discovered as much as a\nscratch in that smooth leather.\n\n\"Sure it has,\" supplemented Merritt, in the suave tones of a stage\nvillain.  \"We're used to playing with good balls.\"\n\n\"Why did you ring this one in on us?\" asked the captain.  \"We never\nthrew out this ball.  We want a chance to hit it.\"\n\nThat was just the one thing we did not want them to have.  But fate\nplayed against us.\n\n\"Get up on your toes, now an' dust,\" said Merritt.  \"Take your\nmedicine, you lazy sit-in-front-of-the-hotel stiffs!  Think of pay day!\"\n\nNot improbably we all entertained the identical thought that old man\nHathaway was the last pitcher under the sun calculated to be effective\nwith the \"rabbit.\"  He never relied on speed; in fact, Merritt often\nscornfully accused him of being unable to break a pane of glass; he\nused principally what we called floaters and a change of pace.  Both\nstyles were absolutely impractical with the \"rabbit.\"\n\n\"It's comin' to us, all right, all right!\" yelled Deerfoot to me,\nacross the intervening grass.  I was of the opinion that it did not\ntake any genius to make Deerfoot's ominous prophecy.\n\nOld man Hathaway gazed at Merritt on the bench as if he wished the\nmanager could hear what he was calling him and then at his\nfellow-players as if both to warn and beseech them. Then he pitched the\n\"rabbit.\"\n\nCrack!\n\nThe big lumbering Canadian rapped the ball at Crab Bane.  I did not see\nit, because it went so fast, but I gathered from Crab's actions that it\nmust have been hit in his direction.  At any rate, one of his legs\nflopped out sidewise as if it had been suddenly jerked, and he fell in\na heap. The ball, a veritable \"rabbit\" in its wild jumps, headed on for\nDeerfoot, who contrived to stop it with his knees.\n\nThe next batter resembled the first one, and the hit likewise, only it\nleaped wickedly at Doran and went through his hands as if they had been\npaper.  The third man batted up a very high fly to Gillinger.  He\nclutched at it with his huge shovel hands, but he could not hold it.\nThe way he pounced upon the ball, dug it out of the grass, and hurled\nit at Hathaway, showed his anger.\n\nObviously Hathaway had to stop the throw, for he could not get out of\nthe road, and he spoke to his captain in what I knew were no\ncomplimentary terms.\n\nThus began retribution.  Those husky lads continued to hammer the\n\"rabbit\" at the infielders and as it bounced harder at every bounce so\nthey batted harder at every bat.\n\nAnother singular feature about the \"rabbit\" was the seeming\nimpossibility for professionals to hold it.  Their familiarity with it,\ntheir understanding of its vagaries and inconsistencies, their mortal\ndread made fielding it a much more difficult thing than for their\nopponents.\n\nBy way of variety, the lambasting Canadians commenced to lambast a few\nover the hills and far away, which chased Deerfoot and me until our\ntongues lolled out.\n\nEvery time a run crossed the plate the motley crowd howled, roared,\ndanced and threw up their hats.  The members of the batting team\npranced up and down the side lines, giving a splendid imitation of\ncannibals celebrating the occasion of a feast.\n\nOnce Snead stooped down to trap the \"rabbit,\" and it slipped through\nhis legs, for which his comrades jeered him unmercifully.  Then a\nbrawny batter sent up a tremendously high fly between short and third.\n\n\"You take it!\" yelled Gillinger to Bane.\n\n\"You take it!\" replied the Crab, and actually walked backward.  That\nball went a mile high. The sky was hazy, gray, the most perplexing in\nwhich to judge a fly ball.  An ordinary fly gave trouble enough in the\ngauging.\n\nGillinger wandered around under the ball for what seemed an age.  It\ndropped as swiftly as a rocket shoots upward.  Gillinger went forward\nin a circle, then sidestepped, and threw up his broad hands.  He\nmisjudged the ball, and it hit him fairly on the head and bounced\nalmost to where Doran stood at second.\n\nOur big captain wilted.  Time was called.  But Gillinger, when he came\nto, refused to leave the game and went back to third with a lump on his\nhead as large as a goose egg.\n\nEvery one of his teammates was sorry, yet every one howled in glee.  To\nbe hit on the head was the unpardonable sin for a professional.\n\nOld man Hathaway gradually lost what little speed he had, and with it\nhis nerve.  Every time he pitched the \"rabbit\" he dodged.  That was\nabout the funniest and strangest thing ever seen on a ball field.  Yet\nit had an element of tragedy.\n\nHathaway's expert contortions saved his head and body on divers\noccasions, but presently a low bounder glanced off the grass and\nmanifested an affinity for his leg.\n\nWe all knew from the crack and the way the pitcher went down that the\n\"rabbit\" had put him out of the game.  The umpire called time, and\nMerritt came running on the diamond.\n\n\"Hard luck, old man,\" said the manager. \"That'll make a green and\nyellow spot all right. Boys, we're still two runs to the good.  There's\none out, an' we can win yet.  Deerfoot, you're as badly crippled as\nHathaway.  The bench for yours.  Hooker will go to center, an' I'll\npitch.\"\n\nMerritt's idea did not strike us as a bad one. He could pitch, and he\nalways kept his arm in prime condition.  We welcomed him into the fray\nfor two reasons--because he might win the game, and because he might be\novertaken by the baseball Nemesis.\n\nWhile Merritt was putting on Hathaway's baseball shoes, some of us\nendeavored to get the \"rabbit\" away from the umpire, but he was too\nwise.\n\nMerritt received the innocent-looking ball with a look of mingled\ndisgust and fear, and he summarily ordered us to our positions.\n\nNot far had we gone, however, when we were electrified by the umpire's\nsharp words:\n\n\"Naw!  Naw, you don't.  I saw you change the ball I gave you fer one in\nyour pocket!  Naw! You don't come enny of your American dodges on us!\nGimmee thet ball, an' you use the other, or I'll stop the game.\"\n\nWherewith the shrewd umpire took the ball from Merritt's hand and\nfished the \"rabbit\" from his pocket.  Our thwarted manager stuttered\nhis wrath.  \"Y-you be-be-wh-whiskered y-yap!  I'll g-g-give----\"\n\nWhat dire threat he had in mind never materialized, for he became\nspeechless.  He glowered upon the cool little umpire, and then turned\ngrandly toward the plate.\n\nIt may have been imagination, yet I made sure Merritt seemed to shrink\nand grow smaller before he pitched a ball.  For one thing the plate was\nuphill from the pitcher's box, and then the fellow standing there\nloomed up like a hill and swung a bat that would have served as a wagon\ntongue. No wonder Merritt evinced nervousness.  Presently he whirled\nand delivered the ball.\n\nBing!\n\nA dark streak and a white puff of dust over second base showed how safe\nthat hit was.  By dint of manful body work, Hooker contrived to stop\nthe \"rabbit\" in mid-center.  Another run scored.  Human nature was\nproof against this temptation, and Merritt's players tendered him\nmanifold congratulations and dissertations.\n\n\"Grand, you old skinflint, grand!\"\n\n\"There was a two-dollar bill stickin' on thet hit.  Why didn't you stop\nit?\"\n\n\"Say, Merritt, what little brains you've got will presently be ridin'\non the 'rabbit.'\"\n\n\"You will chase up these exhibition games!\"\n\n\"Take your medicine now.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!\"\n\nAfter these merciless taunts, and particularly after the next slashing\nhit that tied the score, Merritt looked appreciably smaller and humbler.\n\nHe threw up another ball, and actually shied as it neared the plate.\n\nThe giant who was waiting to slug it evidently thought better of his\neagerness as far as that pitch was concerned, for he let it go by.\n\nMerritt got the next ball higher.  With a mighty swing, the batsman hit\na terrific liner right at the pitcher.\n\nQuick as lightning, Merritt wheeled, and the ball struck him with the\nsound of two boards brought heavily together with a smack.\n\nMerritt did not fall; he melted to the ground and writhed while the\nrunners scored with more tallies than they needed to win.\n\nWhat did we care!  Justice had been done us, and we were unutterably\nhappy.  Crabe Bane stood on his head; Gillinger began a war dance; old\nman Hathaway hobbled out to the side lines and whooped like an Indian;\nSnead rolled over and over in the grass.  All of us broke out into\ntypical expressions of baseball frenzy, and individual ones\nillustrating our particular moods.\n\nMerritt got up and made a dive for the ball. With face positively\nflaming he flung it far beyond the merry crowd, over into a swamp.\nThen he limped for the bench.  Which throw ended the most memorable\ngame ever recorded to the credit of the \"rabbit.\"\n\n\n\nFALSE COLORS\n\n\"Fate has decreed more bad luck for Salisbury in Saturday's game with\nBellville.  It has leaked out that our rivals will come over\nstrengthened by a 'ringer,' no less than Yale's star pitcher, Wayne.\nWe saw him shut Princeton out in June, in the last game of the college\nyear, and we are not optimistic in our predictions as to what Salisbury\ncan do with him.  This appears a rather unfair procedure for Bellville\nto resort to.  Why couldn't they come over with their regular team?\nThey have won a game, and so have we; both games were close and\nbrilliant; the deciding game has roused unusual interest.  We are\ninclined to resent Bellville's methods as unsportsmanlike. All our\nplayers can do is to go into this game on Saturday and try the harder\nto win.\"\n\nWayne laid down the Salisbury Gazette, with a little laugh of\namusement, yet feeling a vague, disquieting sense of something akin to\nregret.\n\n\"Pretty decent of that chap not to roast me,\" he soliloquized.\n\nSomewhere he had heard that Salisbury maintained an unsalaried team.\nIt was notorious among college athletes that the Bellville Club paid\nfor the services of distinguished players.  And this in itself rather\ninclined Wayne to sympathize with Salisbury.  He knew something of the\nstruggles of a strictly amateur club to cope with its semi-professional\nrivals.\n\nAs he was sitting there, idly tipped back in a comfortable chair,\ndreaming over some of the baseball disasters he had survived before his\ncollege career, he saw a young man enter the lobby of the hotel, speak\nto the clerk, and then turn and come directly toward the window where\nWayne was sitting.\n\n\"Are yon Mr. Wayne, the Yale pitcher?\" he asked eagerly.  He was a\nfair-haired, clean-cut young fellow, and his voice rang pleasantly.\n\n\"Guilty,\" replied Wayne.\n\n\"My name's Huling.  I'm captain of the Salisbury nine.  Just learned\nyou were in town and are going to pitch against us tomorrow.  Won't you\nwalk out into the grounds with me now? You might want to warm up a\nlittle.\"\n\n\"Thank you, yes, I will.  Guess I won't need my suit.  I'll just limber\nup, and give my arm a good rub.\"\n\nIt struck Wayne before they had walked far that Huling was an amiable\nand likable chap.  As the captain of the Salisbury nine, he certainly\nhad no reason to be agreeable to the Morristown \"ringer,\" even though\nWayne did happen to be a famous Yale pitcher.\n\nThe field was an oval, green as an emerald, level as a billiard table\nand had no fences or stands to obstruct the open view of the\nsurrounding wooded country.  On each side of the diamond were rows of\nwooden benches, and at one end of the field stood a little clubhouse.\n\nWayne took off his coat, and tossed a ball for a while to an ambitious\nyoungster, and then went into the clubhouse, where Huling introduced\nhim to several of his players.  After a good rubdown, Wayne thanked\nHuling for his courtesy, and started out, intending to go back to town.\n\n\"Why not stay to see us practice?\" asked the captain.  \"We're not\nafraid you'll size up our weaknesses.  As a matter of fact, we don't\nlook forward to any hitting stunts tomorrow, eh, Burns?  Burns, here,\nis our leading hitter, and he's been unusually noncommittal since he\nheard who was going to pitch for Bellville.\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't give a whole lot for my prospects of a home run\ntomorrow,\" said Burns, with a laugh.\n\nWayne went outside, and found a seat in the shade.  A number of urchins\nhad trooped upon the green field, and carriages and motors were already\nin evidence.  By the time the players came out of the dressing room,\nready for practice, there was quite a little crowd in attendance.\n\nDespite Wayne's hesitation, Huling insisted upon introducing him to\nfriends, and finally hauled him up to a big touring car full of girls.\nWayne, being a Yale pitcher, had seen several thousand pretty girls,\nbut the group in that automobile fairly dazzled him.  And the last one\nto whom Huling presented him--with the words:  \"Dorothy, this is Mr.\nWayne, the Yale pitcher, who is to play with Bellville tomorrow; Mr.\nWayne, my sister\"--was the girl he had known he would meet some day.\n\n\"Climb up, Mr. Wayne.  We can make room,\" invited Miss Huling.\n\nWayne thought the awkwardness with which he found a seat beside her was\nunbecoming to a Yale senior.  But, considering she was the girl he had\nbeen expecting to discover for years, his clumsiness bespoke the\nimportance of the event.  The merry laughter of the girls rang in his\nears. Presently, a voice detached itself from the others, and came\nfloating softly to him.\n\n\"Mr. Wayne, so you're going to wrest our laurels from us?\" asked Miss\nHuling.\n\n\"I don't know--I'm not infallible--I've been beaten.\"\n\n\"When?  Not this season?\" she inquired quickly, betraying a knowledge\nof his record that surprised and pleased him.  \"Mr. Wayne, I was at the\nPolo Grounds on June fifteenth.\"\n\nHer white hand lightly touched the Princeton pin at her neck.  Wayne\nroused suddenly out of his trance.  The girl was a Princeton girl!  The\ngleam of her golden hair, the flash of her blue eyes, became clear in\nsight.\n\n\"I'm very pleased to hear it,\" he replied.\n\n\"It was a great game, Mr. Wayne, and you may well be proud of your part\nin winning it.  I shouldn't be surprised if you treated the Salisbury\nteam to the same coat of whitewash.  We girls are up in arms.  Our boys\nstood a fair chance to win this game, but now there's a doubt.  By the\nway, are you acquainted in Bellville?\"\n\n\"No.  I met Reed, the Bellville captain, in New York this week.  He had\nalready gotten an extra pitcher--another ringer--for this game, but he\nsaid he preferred me, if it could be arranged.\"\n\nWhile conversing, Wayne made note of the fact that the other girls\nstudiously left him to Miss Huling.  If the avoidance had not been so\nmarked, he would never have thought of it.\n\n\"Mr. Wayne, if your word is not involved--will you change your mind and\npitch tomorrow's game for us instead of Bellville?\"\n\nQuite amazed, Wayne turned squarely to look at Miss Huling.  Instead of\ndisarming his quick suspicion, her cool, sweet voice, and brave, blue\neyes confirmed it.  The charms of the captain's sister were to be used\nto win him away from the Bellville nine.  He knew the trick; it had\nbeen played upon him before.\n\nBut never had any other such occasion given him a feeling of regret.\nThis case was different. She was the girl.  And she meant to flirt with\nhim, to use her eyes for all they were worth to encompass the Waterloo\nof the rival team.\n\nNo, he had made a mistake, after all--she was not the real girl.\nSuddenly conscious of a little shock of pain, he dismissed that dream\ngirl from his mind, and determined to meet Miss Huling half way in her\ngame.  He could not flirt as well as he could pitch; still, he was no\nnovice.\n\n\"Well, Miss Huling, my word certainly is not involved.  But as to\npitching for Salisbury--that depends.\"\n\n\"Upon what?\"\n\n\"Upon what there is in it.\"\n\n\"Mr. Wayne, you mean--money?  Oh, I know. My brother Rex told me how\nyou college men are paid big sums.  Our association will not give a\ndollar, and, besides, my brother knows nothing of this.  But we girls\nare heart and soul on winning this game.  We'll----\"\n\n\"Miss Huling, I didn't mean remuneration in sordid cash,\" interrupted\nWayne, in a tone that heightened the color in her cheeks.\n\nWayne eyed her keenly with mingled emotions. Was that rose-leaf flush\nin her cheeks natural? Some girls could blush at will.  Were the\nwistful eyes, the earnest lips, only shamming?  It cost him some\nbitterness to decide that they were. Her beauty fascinated, while it\nhardened him. Eternally, the beauty of women meant the undoing of men,\nwhether they played the simple, inconsequential game of baseball, or\nthe great, absorbing, mutable game of life.\n\nThe shame of the situation for him was increasingly annoying, inasmuch\nas this lovely girl should stoop to flirtation with a stranger, and the\nsame time draw him, allure him, despite the apparent insincerity.\n\n\"Miss Huling, I'll pitch your game for two things,\" he continued.\n\n\"Name them.\"\n\n\"Wear Yale blue in place of that orange-and-black Princeton pin.\"\n\n\"I will.\"  She said it with a shyness, a look in her eyes that made\nWayne wince.  What a perfect little actress!  But there seemed just a\nchance that this was not deceit.  For an instant he wavered, held back\nby subtle, finer intuition; then he beat down the mounting influence of\ntruth in those dark-blue eyes, and spoke deliberately:\n\n\"The other thing is--if I win the game--a kiss.\"\n\nDorothy Huling's face flamed scarlet.  But this did not affect Wayne so\ndeeply, though it showed him his mistake, as the darkening shadow of\ndisappointment in her eyes.  If she had been a flirt, she would have\nbeen prepared for rudeness.  He began casting about in his mind for\nsome apology, some mitigation of his offense; but as he was about to\nspeak, the sudden fading of her color, leaving her pale, and the look\nin her proud, dark eyes disconcerted him out of utterance.\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Wayne.  I agree to your price if you win the game.\"\n\nBut how immeasurable was the distance between the shy consent to wear\nYale blue, and the pale, surprised agreement to his second proposal!\nWayne experienced a strange sensation of personal loss.\n\nWhile he endeavored to find his tongue, Miss Huling spoke to one of the\nboys standing near, and he started off on a run for the field.\nPresently Huling and the other players broke for the car, soon\nsurrounding it in breathless anticipation.\n\n\"Wayne, is it straight?  You'll pitch for us tomorrow?\" demanded the\ncaptain, with shining eyes.\n\n\"Surely I will.  Bellville don't need me. They've got Mackay, of\nGeorgetown,\" replied Wayne.\n\nAccustomed as he was to being mobbed by enthusiastic students and\nadmiring friends, Wayne could not but feel extreme embarrassment at the\nreception accorded him now.  He felt that he was sailing under false\ncolors.  The boys mauled him, the girls fluttered about him with glad\nlaughter. He had to tear himself away; and when he finally reached his\nhotel, he went to his room, with his mind in a tumult.\n\nWayne cursed himself roundly; then he fell into deep thought.  He began\nto hope he could retrieve the blunder.  He would win the game; he would\nexplain to her the truth; he would ask for an opportunity to prove he\nwas worthy of her friendship; he would not mention the kiss.  This last\nthought called up the soft curve of her red lips and that it was\npossible for him to kiss her made the temptation strong.\n\nHis sleep that night was not peaceful and dreamless.  He awakened late,\nhad breakfast sent to his room, and then took a long walk out into the\ncountry.  After lunch he dodged the crowd in the hotel lobby, and\nhurried upstairs, where he put on his baseball suit.  The first person\nhe met upon going down was Reed, the Bellville man.\n\n\"What's this I hear, Wayne, about your pitching for Salisbury today?  I\ngot your telegram.\"\n\n\"Straight goods,\" replied Wayne.\n\n\"But I thought you intended to pitch for us?\"\n\n\"I didn't promise, did I?\"\n\n\"No.  Still, it looks fishy to me.\"\n\n\"You've got Mackay, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.  The truth is, I intended to use you both.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll try to win for Salisbury.  Hope there's no hard feeling.\"\n\n\"Not at all.  Only if I didn't have the Georgetown crack, I'd yell\nmurder.  As it is, we'll trim Salisbury anyway.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" answered Wayne, laughing.  \"It's a hot day, and my arm feels\ngood.\"\n\nWhen Wayne reached the ball grounds, he thought he had never seen a\nmore inspiring sight. The bright green oval was surrounded by a\nglittering mass of white and blue and black.  Out along the foul lines\nwere carriages, motors, and tally-hos, brilliant with waving fans and\nflags. Over the field murmured the low hum of many voices.\n\n\"Here you are!\" cried Huling, making a grab for Wayne.  \"Where were you\nthis morning? We couldn't find you.  Come!  We've got a minute before\nthe practice whistle blows, and I promised to exhibit you.\"\n\nHe hustled Wayne down the first-base line, past the cheering crowd, out\namong the motors, to the same touring car that he remembered.  A bevy\nof white-gowned girls rose like a covey of ptarmigans, and whirled\nflags of maroon and gray.\n\nDorothy Huling wore a bow of Yale blue upon her breast, and Wayne saw\nit and her face through a blur.\n\n\"Hurry, girls; get it over.  We've got to practice,\" said the captain.\n\nIn the merry melee some one tied a knot of ribbon upon Wayne.  Who it\nwas he did not know; he saw only the averted face of Dorothy Huling.\nAnd as he returned to the field with a dull pang, he determined he\nwould make her indifference disappear with the gladness of a victory\nfor her team.\n\nThe practice was short, but long enough for Wayne to locate the glaring\nweakness of Salisbury at shortstop and third base.  In fact, most of\nthe players of his team showed rather poor form; they were\noverstrained, and plainly lacked experience necessary for steadiness in\nan important game.\n\nBurns, the catcher, however, gave Wayne confidence.  He was a short,\nsturdy youngster, with all the earmarks of a coming star.  Huling, the\ncaptain, handled himself well at first base.  The Bellville players\nwere more matured, and some of them were former college cracks.  Wayne\nsaw that he had his work cut out for him.\n\nThe whistle blew.  The Bellville team trotted to their position in the\nfield; the umpire called play, and tossed a ball to Mackay, the long,\nlean Georgetown pitcher.\n\nWells, the first batter, fouled out; Stamford hit an easy bounce to the\npitcher, and Clews put up a little Texas leaguer--all going out, one,\ntwo, three, on three pitched balls.\n\nThe teams changed from bat to field.  Wayne faced the plate amid\nvociferous cheering.  He felt that he could beat this team even without\ngood support.  He was in the finest condition, and his arm had been\nresting for ten days.  He knew that if he had control of his high\ninshoot, these Bellville players would feel the whiz of some speed\nunder their chins.\n\nHe struck Moore out, retired Reed on a measly fly, and made Clark hit a\nweak grounder to second; and he walked in to the bench assured of the\noutcome.  On some days he had poor control; on others his drop ball\nrefused to work properly; but, as luck would have it, he had never had\ngreater speed or accuracy, or a more bewildering fast curve than on\nthis day, when he meant to win a game for a girl.\n\n\"Boys, I've got everything,\" he said to his fellow-players, calling\nthem around him.  \"A couple of runs will win for us.  Now, listen, I\nknow Mackay.  He hasn't any speed, or much of a curve. All he's got is\na teasing slow ball and a foxy head. Don't be too anxious to hit.  Make\nhim put 'em over.\"\n\nBut the Salisbury players were not proof against the tempting slow\nballs that Mackay delivered.  They hit at wide curves far off the plate\nand when they did connect with the ball it was only to send an easy\nchance to the infielders.\n\nThe game seesawed along, inning after inning; it was a pitcher's battle\nthat looked as if the first run scored would win the game.  Mackay\ntoyed with the Salisbury boys; it was his pleasure to toss up twisting,\nfloating balls that could scarcely be hit out of the diamond.  Wayne\nhad the Bellville players utterly at his mercy; he mixed up his high\njump and fast drop so cleverly, with his sweeping out-curve, that his\nopponents were unable to gauge his delivery at all.\n\nIn the first of the seventh, Barr for Bellville hit a ball which the\nthird baseman should have fielded.  But he fumbled.  The second batter\nsent a fly to shortstop, who muffed it.  The third hitter reached his\nbase on another error by an infielder.  Here the bases were crowded,\nand the situation had become critical all in a moment. Wayne believed\nthe infield would go to pieces, and lose the game, then and there, if\nanother hit went to short or third.\n\n\"Steady up, boys,\" called Wayne, and beckoned for his catcher.\n\n\"Burns, it's up to you and me,\" he said, in a low tone.  \"I've got to\nfan the rest of these hitters.  You're doing splendidly.  Now, watch\nclose for my drop.  Be ready to go down on your knees. When I let\nmyself out, the ball generally hits the ground just back of the plate.\"\n\n\"Speed 'em over!\" said Burns, his sweaty face grim and determined.\n\"I'll get in front of 'em.\"\n\nThe head of the batting list was up for Bellville, and the whole\nBellville contingent on the side lines rose and yelled and cheered.\n\nMoore was a left handed hitter, who choked his bat up short, and poked\nat the ball.  He was a good bunter, and swift on his feet.  Wayne had\ntaken his measure, as he had that of the other players, earlier in the\ngame; and he knew it was good pitching to keep the ball in close to\nMoore's hands, so that if he did hit it, the chances were it would not\ngo safe.\n\nSummoning all his strength, Wayne took his long swing and shot the ball\nover the inside corner with terrific speed.\n\nOne strike!\n\nWayne knew it would not do to waste any balls if he wished to maintain\nthat speed, so he put the second one in the same place.  Moore struck\ntoo late.\n\nTwo strikes!\n\nThen Burns signed for the last drop.  Wayne delivered it with\ntrepidation, for it was a hard curve to handle.  Moore fell all over\nhimself trying to hit it.  Little Burns dropped to his knees to block\nthe vicious curve.  It struck the ground, and, glancing, boomed deep on\nthe breast protector.\n\nHow the Salisbury supporters roared their approval!  One man out--the\nbases full--with Reed, the slugging captain, at bat!\n\nIf Reed had a weakness, Wayne had not discovered it yet, although Reed\nhad not hit safely. The captain stood somewhat back from the plate, a\nfact that induced Wayne to try him with the speedy outcurve.  Reed\nlunged with a powerful swing, pulling away from the plate, and he\nmissed the curve by a foot.\n\nWayne did not need to know any more.  Reed had made his reputation\nslugging straight balls from heedless pitchers.  He chopped the air\ntwice more, and flung his bat savagely to the ground.\n\n\"Two out--play the hitter!\" called Wayne to his team.\n\nClark, the third man up, was the surest batter on the Bellville team.\nHe looked dangerous.  He had made the only hit so far to the credit of\nhis team.  Wayne tried to work him on a high, fast ball close in.\nClark swung freely and cracked a ripping liner to left.  Half the crowd\nroared, and then groaned, for the beautiful hit went foul by several\nyards.  Wayne wisely decided to risk all on his fast drop.  Clark\nmissed the first, fouled the second.\n\nTwo strikes!\n\nThen he waited.  He cooly let one, two, three of the fast drops go by\nwithout attempting to hit them.  Burns valiantly got his body in front\nof them.  These balls were all over the plate, but too low to be called\nstrikes.  With two strikes, and three balls, and the bases full, Clark\nhad the advantage.\n\nTight as the place was, Wayne did not flinch. The game depended\npractically upon the next ball delivered.  Wayne craftily and daringly\ndecided to use another fast drop, for of all his assortment that would\nbe the one least expected by Clark. But it must be started higher, so\nthat in case Clark made no effort to swing, it would still be a strike.\n\nGripping the ball with a clinched hand, Wayne swung sharply, and drove\nit home with the limit of his power.  It sped like a bullet, waist\nhigh, and just before reaching the plate darted downward, as if it had\nglanced on an invisible barrier.\n\nClark was fooled completely and struck futilely. But the ball caromed\nfrom the hard ground, hit Burns with a resounding thud, and bounced\naway. Clark broke for first, and Moore dashed for home. Like a tiger\nthe little catcher pounced upon the ball, and, leaping back into line,\nblocked the sliding Moore three feet from the plate.\n\nPandemonium burst loose among the Salisbury adherents.  The men bawled,\nthe women screamed, the boys shrieked, and all waved their hats and\nflags, and jumped up and down, and manifested symptoms of baseball\ninsanity.\n\nIn the first of the eighth inning, Mackay sailed up the balls like\nballoons, and disposed of three batters on the same old weak hits to\nhis clever fielders.  In the last of the eighth, Wayne struck out three\nmore Bellville players.\n\n\"Burns, you're up,\" said Wayne, who, in his earnestness to win, kept\ncheering his comrades. \"Do something.  Get your base any way you can.\nGet in front of one.  We must score this inning.\"\n\nFaithful, battered Burns cunningly imposed his hip over the plate and\nreceived another bruise in the interests of his team.  The opposing\nplayers furiously stormed at the umpire for giving him his base, but\nBurns' trick went through.  Burnett bunted skilfully, sending Burns to\nsecond.  Cole hit a fly to center.  Then Huling singled between short\nand third.\n\nIt became necessary for the umpire to delay the game while he put the\nmadly leaping boys back off the coaching lines.  The shrill, hilarious\ncheering gradually died out, and the field settled into a forced quiet.\n\nWayne hurried up to the plate and took his position.  He had always\nbeen a timely hitter, and he gritted his teeth in his resolve to settle\nthis game.  Mackay whirled his long arm, wheeled, took his long stride,\nand pitched a slow, tantalizing ball that seemed never to get anywhere.\nBut Wayne waited, timed it perfectly, and met it squarely.\n\nThe ball flew safely over short, and but for a fine sprint and stop by\nthe left fielder, would have resulted in a triple, possibly a home run.\nAs it was, Burns and Huling scored; and Wayne, by a slide, reached\nsecond base.  When he arose and saw the disorderly riot, and heard the\nnoise of that well-dressed audience, he had a moment of exultation.\nThen Wells flew out to center ending the chances for more runs.\n\nAs Wayne received the ball in the pitcher's box, he paused and looked\nout across the field toward a white-crowned motor car, and he caught a\ngleam of Dorothy Huling's golden hair, and wondered if she were glad.\n\nFor nothing short of the miraculous could snatch this game from him\nnow.  Burns had withstood a severe pounding, but he would last out the\ninning, and Wayne did not take into account the rest of the team.  He\nopened up with no slackening of his terrific speed, and he struck out\nthe three remaining batters on eleven pitched balls. Then in the rising\ndin he ran for Burns and gave him a mighty hug.\n\n\"You made the gamest stand of any catcher I ever pitched to,\" he said\nwarmly.\n\nBurns looked at his quivering, puffed, and bleeding hands, and smiled\nas if to say that this was praise to remember, and reward enough. Then\nthe crowd swooped down on them, and they were swallowed up in the\nclamor and surge of victory.  When Wayne got out of the thick and press\nof it, he made a bee line for his hotel, and by running a gauntlet\nmanaged to escape.\n\nResting, dressing, and dining were matters which he went through\nmechanically, with his mind ever on one thing.  Later, he found a dark\ncorner of the porch and sat there waiting, thinking. There was to be a\ndance given in honor of the team that evening at the hotel.  He watched\nthe boys and girls pass up the steps.  When the music commenced, he\narose and went into the hall. It was bright with white gowns, and gay\nwith movement.\n\n\"There he is.  Grab him, somebody,\" yelled Huling.\n\n\"Do something for me, quick,\" implored Wayne of the captain, as he saw\nthe young people wave toward him.\n\n\"Salisbury is yours tonight,\" replied Huling\n\n\"Ask your sister to save me one dance.\"\n\nThen he gave himself up.  He took his meed of praise and flattery, and\nhe withstood the battery of arch eyes modestly, as became the winner of\nmany fields.  But even the reception after the Princeton game paled in\ncomparison with this impromptu dance.\n\nShe was here.  Always it seemed, while he listened or talked or danced,\nhis eyes were drawn to a slender, graceful form, and a fair face\ncrowned with golden hair.  Then he was making his way to where she\nstood near one of the open windows.\n\nHe never knew what he said to her, nor what reply she made, but she put\nher arm in his, and presently they were gliding over the polished\nfloor.  To Wayne the dance was a dream.  He led her through the hall\nand out upon the balcony, where composure strangely came to him.\n\n\"Mr. Wayne, I have to thank you for saving the day for us.  You pitched\nmagnificently.\"\n\n\"I would have broken my arm to win that game,\" burst out Wayne.  \"Miss\nHuling, I made a blunder yesterday.  I thought there was a conspiracy\nto persuade me to throw down Bellville. I've known of such things, and\nI resented it. You understand what I thought.  I humbly offer my\napologies, and beg that you forget the rude obligation I forced upon\nyou.\"\n\nHow cold she was!  How unattainable in that moment!  He caught his\nbreath, and rushed on.\n\n\"Your brother and the management of the club have asked me to pitch for\nSalisbury the remainder of the season.  I shall be happy to--if----\"\n\n\"If what?\"  She was all alive now, flushing warmly, dark eyes alight,\nthe girl of his dreams.\n\n\"If you will forgive me--if you will let me be your friend--if--Miss\nHuling, you will again wear that bit of Yale blue.\"\n\n\"If, Mr. Wayne, you had very sharp eyes you would have noticed that I\nstill wear it!\"\n\n\n\nTHE MANAGER OF MADDEN'S HILL\n\nWillie Howarth loved baseball.  He loved it all the more because he was\na cripple.  The game was more beautiful and wonderful to him because he\nwould never be able to play it.  For Willie had been born with one leg\nshorter than the other; he could not run and at 11 years of age it was\nall he could do to walk with a crutch.\n\nNevertheless Willie knew more about baseball than any other boy on\nMadden's Hill.  An uncle of his had once been a ballplayer and he had\ntaught Willie the fine points of the game.  And this uncle's ballplayer\nfriends, who occasionally visited him, had imparted to Willie the\nvernacular of the game.  So that Willie's knowledge of players and\nplay, and particularly of the strange talk, the wild and whirling words\non the lips of the real baseball men, made him the envy of every boy on\nMadden's Hill, and a mine of information.  Willie never missed\nattending the games played on the lots, and he could tell why they were\nwon or lost.\n\nWillie suffered considerable pain, mostly at night, and this had given\nhim a habit of lying awake in the dark hours, grieving over that\ncrooked leg that forever shut him out of the heritage of youth.  He had\nkept his secret well; he was accounted shy because he was quiet and had\nnever been able to mingle with the boys in their activity. No one\nexcept his mother dreamed of the fire and hunger and pain within his\nbreast.  His school-mates called him \"Daddy.\"  It was a name given for\nhis bent shoulders, his labored gait and his thoughtful face, too old\nfor his years.  And no one, not even his mother, guessed how that name\nhurt Willie.\n\nIt was a source of growing unhappiness with Willie that the Madden's\nHill boys were always beaten by the other teams of the town.  He really\ncame to lose his sadness over his own misfortune in pondering on the\nwretched play of the Madden's Hill baseball club.  He had all a boy's\npride in the locality where he lived.  And when the Bogg's Farm team\nadministered a crushing defeat to Madden's Hill, Willie grew desperate.\n\nMonday he met Lane Griffith, the captain of the Madden's Hill nine.\n\n\"Hello, Daddy,\" said Lane.  He was a big, aggressive boy, and in a way\nhad a fondness for Willie.\n\n\"Lane, you got an orful trimmin' up on the Boggs.  What 'd you wanter\nlet them country jakes beat you for?\"\n\n\"Aw, Daddy, they was lucky.  Umpire had hay-seed in his eyes!  Robbed\nus!  He couldn't see straight.  We'll trim them down here Saturday.\"\n\n\"No, you won't--not without team work.  Lane, you've got to have a\nmanager.\"\n\n\"Durn it!  Where 're we goin' to get one?\" Lane blurted out.\n\n\"You can sign me.  I can't play, but I know the game.  Let me coach the\nboys.\"\n\nThe idea seemed to strike Capt. Griffith favorably.  He prevailed upon\nall the boys living on Madden's Hill to come out for practice after\nschool.  Then he presented them to the managing coach.  The boys were\ninclined to poke fun at Daddy Howarth and ridicule him; but the idea\nwas a novel one and they were in such a state of subjection from many\nbeatings that they welcomed any change.  Willie sat on a bench\nimprovised from a soap box and put them through a drill of batting and\nfielding.  The next day in his coaching he included bunting and\nsliding.  He played his men in different positions and for three more\ndays he drove them unmercifully.\n\nWhen Saturday came, the day for the game with Bogg's Farm, a wild\nprotest went up from the boys.  Willie experienced his first bitterness\nas a manager.  Out of forty aspirants for the Madden's Hill team he\ncould choose but nine to play the game.  And as a conscientious manager\nhe could use no favorites.  Willie picked the best players and assigned\nthem to positions that, in his judgment, were the best suited to them.\nBob Irvine wanted to play first base and he was down for right field.\nSam Wickhart thought he was the fastest fielder, and Willie had him\nslated to catch. Tom Lindsay's feelings were hurt because he was not to\nplay in the infield.  Eddie Curtis suffered a fall in pride when he\ndiscovered he was not down to play second base.  Jake Thomas, Tay-Tay\nMohler and Brick Grace all wanted to pitch.  The manager had chosen\nFrank Price for that important position, and Frank's one ambition was\nto be a shortstop.\n\nSo there was a deadlock.  For a while there seemed no possibility of a\ngame.  Willie sat on the bench, the center of a crowd of discontented,\nquarreling boys.  Some were jealous, some were outraged, some tried to\npacify and persuade the others.  All were noisy.  Lane Griffith stood\nby his manager and stoutly declared the players should play the\npositions to which they had been assigned or not at all.  And he was\nentering into a hot argument with Tom Lindsay when the Bogg's Farm team\narrogantly put in an appearance.\n\nThe way that team from the country walked out upon the field made a\ngreat difference.  The spirit of Madden's Hill roused to battle.  The\ngame began swiftly and went on wildly.  It ended almost before the Hill\nboys realized it had commenced. They did not know how they had won but\nthey gave Daddy Howarth credit for it.  They had a bonfire that night\nto celebrate the victory and they talked baseball until their parents\nbecame alarmed and hunted them up.\n\nMadden's Hill practiced all that next week and on Saturday beat the\nSeventh Ward team.  In four more weeks they had added half a dozen more\nvictories to their record.  Their reputation went abroad.  They got\nuniforms, and baseball shoes with spikes, and bats and balls and\ngloves.  They got a mask, but Sam Wickhart refused to catch with it.\n\n\"Sam, one of these days you'll be stoppin' a high inshoot with your\neye,\" sagely remarked Daddy Howarth.  \"An' then where'll I get a\ncatcher for the Natchez game?\"\n\nNatchez was the one name on the lips of every Madden's Hill boy.  For\nNatchez had the great team of the town and, roused by the growing\nrepute of the Hill club, had condescended to arrange a game.  When that\ngame was scheduled for July Fourth Daddy Howarth set to driving his\nmen. Early and late he had them out.  This manager, in keeping with all\nother famous managers, believed that batting was the thing which won\ngames.  He developed a hard-hitting team.  He kept everlastingly at\nthem to hit and run, hit and run.\n\nOn the Saturday before the Fourth, Madden's Hill had a game to play\nthat did not worry Daddy and he left his team in charge of the captain.\n\n\"Fellers, I'm goin' down to the Round House to see Natchez play.  I'll\nsize up their game,\" said Daddy.\n\nWhen he returned he was glad to find that his team had won its ninth\nstraight victory, but he was not communicative in regard to the playing\nof the Natchez club.  He appeared more than usually thoughtful.\n\nThe Fourth fell on Tuesday.  Daddy had the boys out Monday and he let\nthem take only a short, sharp practice.  Then he sent them home. In his\nown mind, Daddy did not have much hope of beating Natchez.  He had been\ngreatly impressed by their playing, and one inning toward the close of\nthe Round House game they had astonished him with the way they suddenly\nseemed to break loose and deluge their opponents in a flood of hits and\nruns.  He could not understand this streak of theirs--for they did the\nsame thing every time they played--and he was too good a baseball\nstudent to call it luck.\n\nHe had never wanted anything in his life, not even to have two good\nlegs, as much as he wanted to beat Natchez.  For the Madden's Hill boys\nhad come to believe him infallible.  He was their idol. They imagined\nthey had only to hit and run, to fight and never give up, and Daddy\nwould make them win.  There was not a boy on the team who believed that\nNatchez had a chance.  They had grown proud and tenacious of their\ndearly won reputation.  First of all, Daddy thought of his team and\ntheir loyalty to him; then he thought of the glory lately come to\nMadden's Hill, and lastly of what it meant to him to have risen from a\nlonely watcher of the game--a cripple who could not even carry a\nbat--to manager of the famous Hill team. It might go hard with the boys\nto lose this game, but it would break his heart.\n\nFrom time out of mind there had always been rivalry between Madden's\nHill and Natchez.  And there is no rivalry so bitter as that between\nboys. So Daddy, as he lay awake at night planning the system of play he\nwanted to use, left out of all account any possibility of a peaceful\ngame.  It was comforting to think that if it came to a fight Sam and\nLane could hold their own with Bo Stranathan and Slugger Blandy.\n\nIn the managing of his players Daddy observed strict discipline.  It\nwas no unusual thing for him to fine them.  On practice days and off\nthe field they implicitly obeyed him.  During actual play, however,\nthey had evinced a tendency to jump over the traces.  It had been his\norder for them not to report at the field Tuesday until 2 o'clock. He\nfound it extremely difficult to curb his own inclination to start\nbefore the set time.  And only the stern duty of a man to be an example\nto his players kept Daddy at home.\n\nHe lived near the ball grounds, yet on this day, as he hobbled along on\nhis crutch, he thought the distance interminably long, and for the\nfirst time in weeks the old sickening resentment at his useless leg\nknocked at his heart.  Manfully Daddy refused admittance to that old\ngloomy visitor. He found comfort and forgetfulness in the thought that\nno strong and swift-legged boy of his acquaintance could do what he\ncould do.\n\nUpon arriving at the field Daddy was amazed to see such a large crowd.\nIt appeared that all the boys and girls in the whole town were in\nattendance, and, besides, there was a sprinkling of grown-up people\ninterspersed here and there around the diamond.  Applause greeted\nDaddy's appearance and members of his team escorted him to the soap-box\nbench.\n\nDaddy cast a sharp eye over the Natchez players practicing on the\nfield.  Bo Stranathan had out his strongest team.  They were not a\nprepossessing nine.  They wore soiled uniforms that did not match in\ncut or color.  But they pranced and swaggered and strutted!  They were\nboastful and boisterous.  It was a trial for any Madden's Hill boy just\nto watch them.\n\n\"Wot a swelled bunch!\" exclaimed Tom Lindsay.\n\n\"Fellers, if Slugger Blandy tries to pull any stunt on me today he'll\nget a swelleder nut,\" growled Lane Griffith.\n\n\"T-t-t-t-t-te-te-tell him t-t-t-to keep out of m-m-m-my way an' not\nb-b-b-b-bl-block me,\" stuttered Tay-Tay Mohler.\n\n\"We're a-goin' to skin 'em,\" said Eddie Curtis.\n\n\"Cheese it, you kids, till we git in the game,\" ordered Daddy.  \"Now,\nMadden's Hill, hang round an' listen.  I had to sign articles with\nNatchez--had to let them have their umpire.  So we're up against it.\nBut we'll hit this pitcher Muckle Harris.  He ain't got any steam.  An'\nhe ain't got much nerve.  Now every feller who goes up to bat wants to\ntalk to Muck.  Call him a big swelled stiff.  Tell him he can't break a\npane of glass--tell him he can't put one over the pan--tell him it he\ndoes you'll slam it down in the sand bank.  Bluff the whole team.  Keep\nscrappy all the time.  See!  That's my game today.  This Natchez bunch\nneeds to be gone after.  Holler at the umpire.  Act like you want to\nfight.\"\n\nThen Daddy sent his men out for practice.\n\n\"Boss, enny ground rules?\" inquired Bo Stranathan.  He was a big,\nbushy-haired boy with a grin and protruding teeth.  \"How many bases on\nwild throws over first base an' hits over the sand bank?\"\n\n\"All you can get,\" replied Daddy, with a magnanimous wave of hand.\n\n\"Huh!  Lemmee see your ball?\"\n\nDaddy produced the ball that he had Lane had made for the game.\n\n\"Huh!  Watcher think?  We ain 't goin' to play with no mush ball like\nthet,\" protested Bo.  \"We play with a hard ball.  Looka here!  We'll\ntrow up the ball.\"\n\nDaddy remembered what he had heard about the singular generosity of the\nNatchez team to supply the balls for the games they played.\n\n\"We don't hev to pay nothin' fer them balls. A man down at the Round\nHouse makes them for us.  They ain't no balls as good,\" explained Bo,\nwith pride.\n\nHowever, as Bo did not appear eager to pass over the balls for\nexamination Daddy simply reached out and took them.  They were small,\nperfectly round and as hard as bullets.  They had no covers.  The yarn\nhad been closely and tightly wrapped and then stitched over with fine\nbees-waxed thread.  Daddy fancied he detected a difference in the\nweight of the ball, but Bo took them back before Daddy could be sure of\nthat point.\n\n\"You don't have to fan about it.  I know a ball when I see one,\"\nobserved Daddy.  \"But we're on our own grounds an' we'll use our own\nball. Thanks all the same to you, Stranathan.\"\n\n\"Huh!  All I gotta say is we'll play with my ball er there won't be no\ngame,\" said Bo suddenly.\n\nDaddy shrewdly eyed the Natchez captain.  Bo did not look like a fellow\nwearing himself thin from generosity.  It struck Daddy that Bo's habit\nof supplying the ball for the game might have some relation to the fact\nthat he always carried along his own umpire.  There was a strange\nfeature about this umpire business and it was that Bo's man had earned\na reputation for being particularly fair.  No boy ever had any real\nreason to object to Umpire Gale's decisions.  When Gale umpired away\nfrom the Natchez grounds his close decisions always favored the other\nteam, rather than his own.  It all made Daddy keen and thoughtful.\n\n\"Stranathan, up here on Madden's Hill we know how to treat visitors.\nWe'll play with your ball....  Now keep your gang of rooters from\ncrowdin' on the diamond.\"\n\n\"Boss, it's your grounds.  Fire 'em off if they don't suit you....\nCome on, let's git in the game.  Watcher want--field er bat?\"\n\n\"Field,\" replied Daddy briefly.\n\nBilly Gale called \"Play,\" and the game began with Slugger Blandy at\nbat.  The formidable way in which he swung his club did not appear to\nhave any effect on Frank Price or the player back of him.  Frank's most\nsuccessful pitch was a slow, tantalizing curve, and he used it.  Blandy\nlunged at the ball, missed it and grunted.\n\n\"Frank, you got his alley,\" called Lane.\n\nSlugger fouled the next one high in the air back of the plate.  Sam\nWickhart, the stocky bowlegged catcher, was a fiend for running after\nfoul flies, and now he plunged into the crowd of boys, knocking them\nright and left, and he caught the ball.  Whisner came up and hit safely\nover Griffith, whereupon the Natchez supporters began to howl.  Kelly\nsent a grounder to Grace at short stop.  Daddy's weak player made a\npoor throw to first base, so the runner was safe.  Then Bo Stranathan\nbatted a stinging ball through the infield, scoring Whisner.\n\n\"Play the batter!  Play the batter!\" sharply called Daddy from the\nbench.\n\nThen Frank struck out Molloy and retired Dundon on an easy fly.\n\n\"Fellers, git in the game now,\" ordered Daddy, as his players eagerly\ntrotted in.  \"Say things to that Muckle Harris!  We'll walk through\nthis game like sand through a sieve.\"\n\nBob Irvin ran to the plate waving his bat at Harris.\n\n\"Put one over, you freckleface!  I 've been dyin' fer this chanst.\nYou're on Madden's Hill now.\"\n\nMuckle evidently was not the kind of pitcher to stand coolly under such\nbantering.  Obviously he was not used to it.  His face grew red and his\nhair waved up.  Swinging hard, he threw the ball straight at Bob's\nhead.  Quick as a cat, Bob dropped flat.\n\n\"Never touched me!\" he chirped, jumping up and pounding the plate with\nhis bat.  \"You couldn't hit a barn door.  Come on.  I'll paste one a\nmile!\"\n\nBob did not get an opportunity to hit, for Harris could not locate the\nplate and passed him to first on four balls.\n\n\"Dump the first one,\" whispered Daddy in Grace's ear.  Then he gave Bob\na signal to run on the first pitch.\n\nGrace tried to bunt the first ball, but he missed it.  His attempt,\nhowever, was so violent that he fell over in front of the catcher, who\ncould not recover in time to throw, and Bob got to second base.  At\nthis juncture, the Madden's Hill band of loyal supporters opened up\nwith a mingling of shrill yells and whistles and jangling of tin cans\nfilled with pebbles.  Grace hit the next ball into second base and,\nwhile he was being thrown out, Bob raced to third.  With Sam Wickhart\nup it looked good for a score, and the crowd yelled louder.  Sam was\nawkward yet efficient, and he batted a long fly to right field.  The\nfielder muffed the ball.  Bob scored, Sam reached second base, and the\ncrowd yelled still louder.  Then Lane struck out and Mohler hit to\nshortstop, retiring the side.\n\nNatchez scored a run on a hit, a base on balls, and another error by\nGrace.  Every time a ball went toward Grace at short Daddy groaned.  In\ntheir half of the inning Madden's Hill made two runs, increasing the\nscore 3 to 2.\n\nThe Madden's Hill boys began to show the strain of such a close\ncontest.  If Daddy had voiced aloud his fear it would have been:\n\"They'll blow up in a minnit!\"  Frank Price alone was slow and cool,\nand he pitched in masterly style. Natchez could not beat him.  On the\nother hand, Madden's Hill hit Muck Harris hard, but superb fielding\nkept runners off the bases.  As Daddy's team became more tense and\nexcited Bo Stranathan's players grew steadier and more arrogantly\nconfident.  Daddy saw it with distress, and he could not realize just\nwhere Natchez had license for such confidence.  Daddy watched the game\nwith the eyes of a hawk.\n\nAs the Natchez players trooped in for their sixth inning at bat, Daddy\nobserved a marked change in their demeanor.  Suddenly they seemed to\nhave been let loose; they were like a band of Indians.  Daddy saw\neverything.  He did not miss seeing Umpire Gale take a ball from his\npocket and toss it to Frank, and Daddy wondered if that was the ball\nwhich had been in the play.  Straightway, however, he forgot that in\nthe interest of the game.\n\nBo Stranathan bawled:  \"Wull, Injuns, hyar's were we do 'em.  We've\njest ben loafin' along.  Git ready to tear the air, you rooters!\"\n\nKelly hit a wonderfully swift ball through the infield.  Bo batted out\na single.  Malloy got up in the way of one of Frank's pitches, and was\npassed to first base.  Then, as the Natchez crowd opened up in shrill\nclamor, the impending disaster fell.  Dundon hit a bounder down into\nthe infield. The ball appeared to be endowed with life.  It bounded\nlow, then high and, cracking into Grace's hands, bounced out and rolled\naway.  The runners raced around the bases.\n\nPickens sent up a tremendous fly, the highest ever batted on Madden's\nHill.  It went over Tom Lindsay in center field, and Tom ran and ran.\nThe ball went so far up that Tom had time to cover the ground, but he\ncould not judge it.  He ran round in a little circle, with hands up in\nbewilderment.  And when the ball dropped it hit him on the head and\nbounded away.\n\n\"Run, you Injun, run!\" bawled Bo.  \"What'd I tell you?  We ain't got\n'em goin', oh, no!  Hittin' 'em on the head!\"\n\nBill dropped a slow, teasing ball down the third-base line.  Jake\nThomas ran desperately for it, and the ball appeared to strike his\nhands and run up his arms and caress his nose and wrap itself round his\nneck and then roll gently away.  All the while, the Natchez runners\ntore wildly about the bases and the Natchez supporters screamed and\nwhistled.  Muck Harris could not bat, yet he hit the first ball and it\nshot like a bullet over the infield.  Then Slugger Blandy came to the\nplate.\n\nThe ball he sent out knocked Grace's leg from under him as if it were a\nten-pin.  Whisner popped a fly over Tay Tay Mohler's head.  Now Tay Tay\nwas fat and slow, but he was a sure catch.  He got under the ball.  It\nstruck his hands and jumped back twenty feet up into the air.  It was a\nstrangely live ball.  Kelly again hit to shortstop, and the ball\nappeared to start slow, to gather speed with every bound and at last to\ndart low and shoot between Grace's legs.\n\n\"Haw!  Haw!\" roared Bo.  \"They've got a hole at short.  Hit fer the\nhole, fellers.  Watch me!  Jest watch me!\"\n\nAnd he swung hard on the first pitch.  The ball glanced like a streak\nstraight at Grace, took a vicious jump, and seemed to flirt with the\ninfielder's hands, only to evade them.\n\nMalloy fouled a pitch and the ball hit Sam Wickhart square over the\neye.  Sam's eye popped out and assumed the proportions and color of a\nhuge plum.\n\n\"Hey!\" yelled Blandy, the rival catcher.  \"Air you ketchin' with yer\nmug?\"\n\nSam would not delay the game nor would he don the mask.\n\nDaddy sat hunched on his soap-box, and, as in a hateful dream, he saw\nhis famous team go to pieces.  He put his hands over his ears to shut\nout some of the uproar.  And he watched that little yarn ball fly and\nshoot and bound and roll to crush his fondest hopes.  Not one of his\nplayers appeared able to hold it.  And Grace had holes in his hands and\nlegs and body.  The ball went right through him.  He might as well have\nbeen so much water.  Instead of being a shortstop he was simply a hole.\nAfter every hit Daddy saw that ball more and more as something alive.\nIt sported with his infielders.  It bounded like a huge jack-rabbit,\nand went swifter and higher at every bound.  It was here, there,\neverywhere.\n\nAnd it became an infernal ball.  It became endowed with a fiendish\npropensity to run up a player's leg and all about him, as if trying to\nhide in his pocket.  Grace's efforts to find it were heartbreaking to\nwatch.  Every time it bounded out to center field, which was of\nfrequent occurrence, Tom would fall on it and hug it as if he were\ntrying to capture a fleeing squirrel.  Tay Tay Mohler could stop the\nball, but that was no great credit to him, for his hands took no part\nin the achievement.  Tay Tay was fat and the ball seemed to like him.\nIt boomed into his stomach and banged against his stout legs.  When Tay\nsaw it coming he dropped on his knees and valorously sacrificed his\nanatomy to the cause of the game.\n\nDaddy tried not to notice the scoring of runs by his opponents.  But he\nhad to see them and he had to count.  Ten runs were as ten blows!\nAfter that each run scored was like a stab in his heart. The play went\non, a terrible fusilade of wicked ground balls that baffled any attempt\nto field them. Then, with nineteen runs scored, Natchez appeared to\ntire.  Sam caught a foul fly, and Tay Tay, by obtruding his wide person\nto the path of infield hits, managed to stop them, and throw out the\nrunners.\n\nScore--Natchez, 21; Madden Hill, 3.\n\nDaddy's boys slouched and limped wearily in.\n\n\"Wot kind of a ball's that?\" panted Tom, as he showed his head with a\nbruise as large as a goose-egg.\n\n\"T-t-t-t-ta-ta-tay-tay-tay-tay----\" began Mohler, in great excitement,\nbut as he could not finish what he wanted to say no one caught his\nmeaning.\n\nDaddy's watchful eye had never left that wonderful, infernal little\nyarn ball.  Daddy was crushed under defeat, but his baseball brains\nstill continued to work.  He saw Umpire Gale leisurely step into the\npitcher's box, and leisurely pick up the ball and start to make a\nmotion to put it in his pocket.\n\nSuddenly fire flashed all over Daddy.\n\n\"Hyar!  Don't hide that ball!\" he yelled, in his piercing tenor.\n\nHe jumped up quickly, forgetting his crutch, and fell headlong.  Lane\nand Sam got him upright and handed the crutch to him.  Daddy began to\nhobble out to the pitcher's box.\n\n\"Don't you hide that ball.  See!  I've got my eye on this game.  That\nball was in play, an' you can't use the other.\"\n\nUmpire Gale looked sheepish, and his eyes did not meet Daddy's.  Then\nBo came trotting up.\n\n\"What's wrong, boss?\" he asked.\n\n\"Aw, nuthin'.  You're tryin' to switch balls on me.  That's all.  You\ncan't pull off any stunts on Madden's Hill.\"\n\n\"Why, boss, thet ball's all right.  What you hollerin' about?\"\n\n\"Sure that ball's all right,\" replied Daddy. \"It's a fine ball.  An' we\nwant a chanst to hit it! See?\"\n\nBo flared up and tried to bluster, but Daddy cut him short.\n\n\"Give us our innin'--let us git a whack at that ball, or I'll run you\noff Madden's Hill.\"\n\nBo suddenly looked a little pale and sick.\n\n\"Course youse can git a whack at it,\" he said, in a weak attempt to be\nnatural and dignified.\n\nDaddy tossed the ball to Harris, and as he hobbled off the field he\nheard Bo calling out low and cautiously to his players.  Then Daddy was\ncertain he had discovered a trick.  He called his players around him.\n\n\"This game ain't over yet.  It ain't any more'n begun.  I'll tell you\nwhat.  Last innin' Bo's umpire switched balls on us.  That ball was\nlively. An' they tried to switch back on me.  But nix! We're goin' to\ngit a chanst to hit that lively ball, An' they're goin' to git a dose\nof their own medicine.  Now, you dead ones--come back to life! Show me\nsome hittin' an' runnin'.\"\n\n\"Daddy, you mean they run in a trick on us?\" demanded Lane, with\nflashing eyes.\n\n\"Funny about Natchez's strong finishes!\" replied Daddy, coolly, as he\neyed his angry players.\n\nThey let out a roar, and then ran for the bats.\n\nThe crowd, quick to sense what was in the air, thronged to the diamond\nand manifested alarming signs of outbreak.\n\nSam Wickhart leaped to the plate and brandished his club.\n\n\"Sam, let him pitch a couple,\" called Daddy from the bench.  \"Mebbe\nwe'll git wise then.\"\n\nHarris had pitched only twice when the fact became plain that he could\nnot throw this ball with the same speed as the other.  The ball was\nheavier; besides Harris was also growing tired. The next pitch Sam hit\nfar out over the center fielder's head for a home run.  It was a longer\nhit than any Madden's Hill boy had ever made. The crowd shrieked its\ndelight.  Sam crossed the plate and then fell on the bench beside Daddy.\n\n\"Say! that ball nearly knocked the bat out of my hands,\" panted Sam.\n\"It made the bat spring!\"\n\n\"Fellers, don't wait,\" ordered Daddy.  \"Don't give the umpire a chanst\nto roast us now.  Slam the first ball!\"\n\nThe aggressive captain lined the ball at Bo Stranathan.  The Natchez\nshortstop had a fine opportunity to make the catch, but he made an\ninglorious muff.  Tay Tay hurried to bat.  Umpire Gale called the first\npitch a strike.  Tay slammed down his club.  \"T-t-t-t-to-to-twasn't\nover,\" he cried.  \"T-t-t-tay----\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" yelled Daddy.  \"We want to git this game over today.\"\n\nTay Tay was fat and he was also strong, so that when beef and muscle\nboth went hard against the ball it traveled.  It looked as if it were\ngoing a mile straight up.  All the infielders ran to get under it.\nThey got into a tangle, into which the ball descended.  No one caught\nit, and thereupon the Natchez players began to rail at one another. Bo\nstormed at them, and they talked back to him. Then when Tom Lindsay hit\na little slow grounder into the infield it seemed that a just\nretribution had overtaken the great Natchez team.\n\nOrdinarily this grounder of Tom's would have been easy for a novice to\nfield.  But this peculiar grounder, after it has hit the ground once,\nseemed to wake up and feel lively.  It lost its leisurely action and\nbegan to have celerity.  When it reached Dundon it had the strange,\njerky speed so characteristic of the grounders that had confused the\nMadden's Hill team.  Dundon got his hands on the ball and it would not\nstay in them.  When finally he trapped it Tom had crossed first base\nand another runner had scored.  Eddie Curtis cracked another at Bo.\nThe Natchez captain dove for it, made a good stop, bounced after the\nrolling ball, and then threw to Kelly at first.  The ball knocked\nKelly's hands apart as if they had been paper.  Jake Thomas batted left\nhanded and he swung hard on a slow pitch and sent the ball far into\nright field.  Runners scored.  Jake's hit was a three-bagger.  Then\nFrank Price hit up an infield fly.  Bo yelled for Dundon to take it and\nDundon yelled for Harris.  They were all afraid to try for it.  It\ndropped safely while Jake ran home.\n\nWith the heavy batters up the excitement increased.  A continuous\nscream and incessant rattle of tin cans made it impossible to hear what\nthe umpire called out.  But that was not important, for he seldom had a\nchance to call either ball or strike.  Harris had lost his speed and\nnearly every ball he pitched was hit by the Madden's Hill boys.  Irvine\ncracked one down between short and third.  Bo and Pickens ran for it\nand collided while the ball jauntily skipped out to left field and,\ndeftly evading Bell, went on and on.  Bob reached third.  Grace hit\nanother at Dundon, who appeared actually to stop it four times before\nhe could pick it up, and then he was too late.  The doughty bow-legged\nSam, with his huge black eye, hung over the plate and howled at Muckle.\nIn the din no one heard what he said, but evidently Muck divined it.\nFor he roused to the spirit of a pitcher who would die of shame if he\ncould not fool a one-eyed batter.  But Sam swooped down and upon the\nfirst ball and drove it back toward the pitcher.  Muck could not get\nout of the way and the ball made his leg buckle under him.  Then that\nhit glanced off to begin a marvelous exhibition of high and erratic\nbounding about the infield.\n\nDaddy hunched over his soap-box bench and hugged himself.  He was\nfarsighted and he saw victory.  Again he watched the queer antics of\nthat little yarn ball, but now with different feelings. Every hit\nseemed to lift him to the skies.  He kept silent, though every time the\nball fooled a Natchez player Daddy wanted to yell.  And when it started\nfor Bo and, as if in revenge, bounded wickeder at every bounce to skip\noff the grass and make Bo look ridiculous, then Daddy experienced the\nhappiest moments of his baseball career.  Every time a tally crossed\nthe plate he would chalk it down on his soap box.\n\nBut when Madden's Hill scored the nineteenth run without a player being\nput out, then Daddy lost count.  He gave himself up to revel.  He sat\nmotionless and silent; nevertheless his whole internal being was in the\nstate of wild tumult.  It was as if he was being rewarded in joy for\nall the misery he had suffered because he was a cripple. He could never\nplay baseball, but he had baseball brains.  He had been too wise for\nthe tricky Stranathan.  He was the coach and manager and general of the\ngreat Madden's Hill nine. If ever he had to lie awake at night again he\nwould not mourn over his lameness; he would have something to think\nabout.  To him would be given the glory of beating the invincible\nNatchez team.  So Daddy felt the last bitterness leave him.  And he\nwatched that strange little yarn ball, with its wonderful skips and\ndarts and curves.  The longer the game progressed and the wearier\nHarris grew, the harder the Madden's Hill boys batted the ball and the\ncrazier it bounced at Bo and his sick players.  Finally, Tay Tay Mohler\nhit a teasing grounder down to Bo.\n\nThen it was as if the ball, realizing a climax, made ready for a final\nspurt.  When Bo reached for the ball it was somewhere else.  Dundon\ncould not locate it.  And Kelly, rushing down to the chase, fell all\nover himself and his teammates trying to grasp the illusive ball, and\nall the time Tay Tay was running.  He never stopped.  But as he was\nheavy and fat he did not make fast time on the bases.  Frantically the\noutfielders ran in to head off the bouncing ball, and when they had\nsucceeded Tay Tay had performed the remarkable feat of making a home\nrun on a ball batted into the infield.\n\nThat broke Natchez's spirit.  They quit.  They hurried for their bats.\nOnly Bo remained behind a moment to try to get his yarn ball.  But Sam\nhad pounced upon it and given it safely to Daddy. Bo made one sullen\ndemand for it.\n\n\"Funny about them fast finishes of yours!\" said Daddy scornfully.\n\"Say! the ball's our'n.  The winnin' team gits the ball.  Go home an'\nlook up the rules of the game!\"\n\nBo slouched off the field to a shrill hooting and tin canning.\n\n\"Fellers, what was the score?\" asked Daddy.\n\nNobody knew the exact number of runs made by Madden's Hill.\n\n\"Gimme a knife, somebody,\" said the manager.\n\nWhen it had been produced Daddy laid down the yarn ball and cut into\nit.  The blade entered readily for a inch and then stopped.  Daddy cut\nall around the ball, and removed the cover of tightly wrapped yarn.\nInside was a solid ball of India rubber.\n\n\"Say! it ain't so funny now--how that ball bounced,\" remarked Daddy.\n\n\"Wot you think of that!\" exclaimed Tom, feeling the lump on his head.\n\n\"T-t-t-t-t-t-t-ta-tr----\" began Tay Tay Mohler.\n\n\"Say it!  Say it!\" interrupted Daddy.\n\n\"Ta-ta-ta-tr-trimmed them wa-wa-wa-wa-with their own\nb-b-b-b-b-ba-ba-ball,\" finished Tay.\n\n\n\nOLD WELL-WELL\n\nHe bought a ticket at the 25-cent window, and edging his huge bulk\nthrough the turnstile, laboriously followed the noisy crowd toward the\nbleachers. I could not have been mistaken.  He was Old Well-Well,\nfamous from Boston to Baltimore as the greatest baseball fan in the\nEast.  His singular yell had pealed into the ears of five hundred\nthousand worshippers of the national game and would never be forgotten.\n\nAt sight of him I recalled a friend's baseball talk.  \"You remember Old\nWell-Well?  He's all in--dying, poor old fellow!  It seems young Burt,\nwhom the Phillies are trying out this spring, is Old Well-Well's nephew\nand protege.  Used to play on the Murray Hill team; a speedy youngster.\nWhen the Philadelphia team was here last, Manager Crestline announced\nhis intention to play Burt in center field.  Old Well-Well was too ill\nto see the lad get his tryout.  He was heart-broken and said:  'If I\ncould only see one more game!'\"\n\nThe recollection of this random baseball gossip and the fact that\nPhiladelphia was scheduled to play New York that very day, gave me a\nsudden desire to see the game with Old Well-Well.  I did not know him,\nbut where on earth were introductions as superfluous as on the\nbleachers?  It was a very easy matter to catch up with him.  He walked\nslowly, leaning hard on a cane and his wide shoulders sagged as he\npuffed along.  I was about to make some pleasant remark concerning the\nprospects of a fine game, when the sight of his face shocked me and I\ndrew back.  If ever I had seen shadow of pain and shade of death they\nhovered darkly around Old Well-Well.\n\nNo one accompanied him; no one seemed to recognize him.  The majority\nof that merry crowd of boys and men would have jumped up wild with\npleasure to hear his well-remembered yell.  Not much longer than a year\nbefore, I had seen ten thousand fans rise as one man and roar a\ngreeting to him that shook the stands.  So I was confronted by a\nsituation strikingly calculated to rouse my curiosity and sympathy.\n\nHe found an end seat on a row at about the middle of the right-field\nbleachers and I chose one across the aisle and somewhat behind him. No\nplayers were yet in sight.  The stands were filling up and streams of\nmen were filing into the aisles of the bleachers and piling over the\nbenches. Old Well-Well settled himself comfortably in his seat and\ngazed about him with animation.  There had come a change to his massive\nfeatures.  The hard lines had softened; the patches of gray were no\nlonger visible; his cheeks were ruddy; something akin to a smile shone\non his face as he looked around, missing no detail of the familiar\nscene.\n\nDuring the practice of the home team Old Well-Well sat still with his\nbig hands on his knees; but when the gong rang for the Phillies, he\ngrew restless, squirming in his seat and half rose several times.  I\ndivined the importuning of his old habit to greet his team with the\nyell that had made him famous.  I expected him to get up; I waited for\nit.  Gradually, however, he became quiet as a man governed by severe\nself-restraint and directed his attention to the Philadelphia center\nfielder.\n\nAt a glance I saw that the player was new to me and answered the\nnewspaper description of young Burt.  What a lively looking athlete!\nHe was tall, lithe, yet sturdy.  He did not need to chase more than two\nfly balls to win me.  His graceful, fast style reminded me of the great\nCurt Welch.  Old Well-Well's face wore a rapt expression.  I discovered\nmyself hoping Burt would make good; wishing he would rip the boards off\nthe fence; praying he would break up the game.\n\nIt was Saturday, and by the time the gong sounded for the game to begin\nthe grand stand and bleachers were packed.  The scene was glittering,\ncolorful, a delight to the eye.  Around the circle of bright faces\nrippled a low, merry murmur.  The umpire, grotesquely padded in front\nby his chest protector, announced the batteries, dusted the plate, and\nthrowing out a white ball, sang the open sesame of the game:  \"Play!\"\n\nThen Old Well-Well arose as if pushed from his seat by some strong\npropelling force.  It had been his wont always when play was ordered or\nin a moment of silent suspense, or a lull in the applause, or a\ndramatic pause when hearts heat high and lips were mute, to bawl out\nover the listening, waiting multitude his terrific blast:\n\"Well-Well-Well!\"\n\nTwice he opened his mouth, gurgled and choked, and then resumed his\nseat with a very red, agitated face; something had deterred him from\nhis purpose, or he had been physically incapable of yelling.\n\nThe game opened with White's sharp bounder to the infield.  Wesley had\nthree strikes called on him, and Kelly fouled out to third base.  The\nPhillies did no better, being retired in one, two, three order.  The\nsecond inning was short and no tallies were chalked up.  Brain hit\nsafely in the third and went to second on a sacrifice.  The bleachers\nbegan to stamp and cheer.  He reached third on an infield hit that the\nPhiladelphia short-stop knocked down but could not cover in time to\ncatch either runner.  The cheer in the grand stand was drowned by the\nroar in the bleachers. Brain scored on a fly-ball to left.  A double\nalong the right foul line brought the second runner home.  Following\nthat the next batter went out on strikes.\n\nIn the Philadelphia half of the inning young Burt was the first man up.\nHe stood left-handed at the plate and looked formidable.  Duveen, the\nwary old pitcher for New York, to whom this new player was an unknown\nquantity, eyed his easy position as if reckoning on a possible\nweakness. Then he took his swing and threw the ball.  Burt never moved\na muscle and the umpire called strike. The next was a ball, the next a\nstrike; still Burt had not moved.\n\n\"Somebody wake him up!\" yelled a wag in the bleachers.  \"He's from\nSlumbertown, all right, all right!\" shouted another.\n\nDuveen sent up another ball, high and swift. Burt hit straight over the\nfirst baseman, a line drive that struck the front of the right-field\nbleachers.\n\n\"Peacherino!\" howled a fan.\n\nHere the promise of Burt's speed was fulfilled. Run!  He was fleet as a\ndeer.  He cut through first like the wind, settled to a driving strides\nrounded second, and by a good, long slide beat the throw in to third.\nThe crowd, who went to games to see long hits and daring runs, gave him\na generous hand-clapping.\n\nOld Well-Well appeared on the verge of apoplexy. His ruddy face turned\npurple, then black; he rose in his seat; he gave vent to smothered\ngasps; then he straightened up and clutched his hands into his knees.\n\nBurt scored his run on a hit to deep short, an infielder's choice, with\nthe chances against retiring a runner at the plate.  Philadelphia could\nnot tally again that inning.  New York blanked in the first of the\nnext.  For their opponents, an error, a close decision at second\nfavoring the runner, and a single to right tied the score.  Bell of New\nYork got a clean hit in the opening of the fifth. With no one out and\nchances for a run, the impatient fans let loose.  Four subway trains in\ncollision would not have equalled the yell and stamp in the bleachers.\nMaloney was next to bat and he essayed a bunt.  This the fans derided\nwith hoots and hisses.  No team work, no inside ball for them.\n\n\"Hit it out!\" yelled a hundred in unison.\n\n\"Home run!\" screamed a worshipper of long hits.\n\nAs if actuated by the sentiments of his admirers Maloney lined the ball\nover short.  It looked good for a double; it certainly would advance\nBell to third; maybe home.  But no one calculated on Burt.  His\nfleetness enabled him to head the bounding ball.  He picked it up\ncleanly, and checking his headlong run, threw toward third base. Bell\nwas half way there.  The ball shot straight and low with terrific force\nand beat the runner to the bag.\n\n\"What a great arm!\" I exclaimed, deep in my throat.  \"It's the lad's\nday!  He can't be stopped.\"\n\nThe keen newsboy sitting below us broke the amazed silence in the\nbleachers.\n\n\"Wot d'ye tink o' that?\"\n\nOld Well-Well writhed in his seat.  To him if was a one-man game, as it\nhad come to be for me. I thrilled with him; I gloried in the making\ngood of his protege; it got to be an effort on my part to look at the\nold man, so keenly did his emotion communicate itself to me.\n\nThe game went on, a close, exciting, brilliantly fought battle.  Both\npitchers were at their best. The batters batted out long flies, low\nliners, and sharp grounders; the fielders fielded these difficult\nchances without misplay.  Opportunities came for runs, but no runs were\nscored for several innings.  Hopes were raised to the highest pitch\nonly to be dashed astonishingly away.  The crowd in the grand stand\nswayed to every pitched ball; the bleachers tossed like surf in a storm.\n\nTo start the eighth, Stranathan of New York tripled along the left foul\nline.  Thunder burst from the fans and rolled swellingly around the\nfield.  Before the hoarse yelling, the shrill hooting, the hollow\nstamping had ceased Stranathan made home on an infield hit.  Then\nbedlam broke loose.  It calmed down quickly, for the fans sensed\ntrouble between Binghamton, who had been thrown out in the play, and\nthe umpire who was waving him back to the bench.\n\n\"You dizzy-eyed old woman, you can't see straight!\" called Binghamton.\n\nThe umpire's reply was lost, but it was evident that the offending\nplayer had been ordered out of the grounds.\n\nBinghamton swaggered along the bleachers while the umpire slowly\nreturned to his post.  The fans took exception to the player's\nobjection and were not slow in expressing it.  Various witty enconiums,\nnot to be misunderstood, attested to the bleachers' love of fair play\nand their disgust at a player's getting himself put out of the game at\na critical stage.\n\nThe game proceeded.  A second batter had been thrown out.  Then two\nhits in succession looked good for another run.  White, the next\nbatter, sent a single over second base.  Burt scooped the ball on the\nfirst bounce and let drive for the plate. It was another extraordinary\nthrow.  Whether ball or runner reached home base first was most\ndifficult to decide.  The umpire made his sweeping wave of hand and the\nbreathless crowd caught his decision.\n\n\"Out!\"\n\nIn action and sound the circle of bleachers resembled a long curved\nbeach with a mounting breaker thundering turbulently high.\n\n\"Rob--b--ber--r!\" bawled the outraged fans, betraying their marvelous\ninconsistency.\n\nOld Well-Well breathed hard.  Again the wrestling of his body signified\nan inward strife.  I began to feel sure that the man was in a mingled\ntorment of joy and pain, that he fought the maddening desire to yell\nbecause he knew he had not the strength to stand it.  Surely, in all\nthe years of his long following of baseball he had never had the\nincentive to express himself in his peculiar way that rioted him now.\nSurely, before the game ended he would split the winds with his\nwonderful yell.\n\nDuveen's only base on balls, with the help of a bunt, a steal, and a\nscratch hit, resulted in a run for Philadelphia, again tying the score.\nHow the fans raged at Fuller for failing to field the lucky scratch.\n\n\"We had the game on ice!\" one cried.\n\n\"Get him a basket!\"\n\nNew York men got on bases in the ninth and made strenuous efforts to\ncross the plate, but it was not to be.  Philadelphia opened up with two\nscorching hits and then a double steal.  Burt came up with runners on\nsecond and third.  Half the crowd cheered in fair appreciation of the\nway fate was starring the ambitious young outfielder; the other half,\ndyed-in-the-wool home-team fans, bent forward in a waiting silent gloom\nof fear.  Burt knocked the dirt out of his spikes and faced Duveen.\nThe second ball pitched he met fairly and it rang like a bell.\n\nNo one in the stands saw where it went.  But they heard the crack, saw\nthe New York shortstop stagger and then pounce forward to pick up the\nball and speed it toward the plate.  The catcher was quick to tag the\nincoming runner, and then snap the ball to first base, completing a\ndouble play.\n\nWhen the crowd fully grasped this, which was after an instant of\nbewilderment, a hoarse crashing roar rolled out across the field to\nbellow back in loud echo from Coogan's Bluff.  The grand stand\nresembled a colored corn field waving in a violent wind; the bleachers\nlost all semblance of anything.  Frenzied, flinging action--wild\nchaos--shrieking cries--manifested sheer insanity of joy.\n\nWhen the noise subsided, one fan, evidently a little longer-winded than\nhis comrades, cried out hysterically:\n\n\"O-h!  I don't care what becomes of me--now-w!\"\n\nScore tied, three to three, game must go ten innings--that was the\nshibboleth; that was the overmastering truth.  The game did go ten\ninnings--eleven--twelve, every one marked by masterly pitching, full of\nmagnificent catches, stops and throws, replete with reckless\nbase-running and slides like flashes in the dust.  But they were\nunproductive of runs.  Three to three!  Thirteen innings!\n\n\"Unlucky thirteenth,\" wailed a superstitious fan.\n\nI had got down to plugging, and for the first time, not for my home\nteam.  I wanted Philadelphia to win, because Burt was on the team.\nWith Old Well-Well sitting there so rigid in his seat, so obsessed by\nthe playing of the lad, I turned traitor to New York.\n\nWhite cut a high twisting bounder inside the third base, and before the\nball could be returned he stood safely on second.  The fans howled with\nwhat husky voice they had left.  The second hitter batted a\ntremendously high fly toward center field. Burt wheeled with the crack\nof the ball and raced for the ropes.  Onward the ball soared like a\nsailing swallow; the fleet fielder ran with his back to the stands.\nWhat an age that ball stayed in the air!  Then it lost its speed,\ngracefully curved and began to fall.  Burt lunged forward and upwards;\nthe ball lit in his hands and stuck there as he plunged over the ropes\ninto the crowd.  White had leisurely trotted half way to third; he saw\nthe catch, ran back to touch second and then easily made third on the\nthrow-in.  The applause that greeted Burt proved the splendid spirit of\nthe game.  Bell placed a safe little hit over short, scoring White.\nHeaving, bobbing bleachers--wild, broken, roar on roar!\n\nScore four to three--only one half inning left for Philadelphia to\nplay--how the fans rooted for another run!  A swift double-play,\nhowever, ended the inning.\n\nPhiladelphia's first hitter had three strikes called on him.\n\n\"Asleep at the switch!\" yelled a delighted fan.\n\nThe next batter went out on a weak pop-up fly to second.\n\n\"Nothin' to it!\"\n\n\"Oh, I hate to take this money!\"\n\n\"All-l o-over!\"\n\nTwo men at least of all that vast assemblage had not given up victory\nfor Philadelphia.  I had not dared to look at Old Well-Well for a long,\nwhile.  I dreaded the nest portentious moment. I felt deep within me\nsomething like clairvoyant force, an intangible belief fostered by hope.\n\nMagoon, the slugger of the Phillies, slugged one against the left field\nbleachers, but, being heavy and slow, he could not get beyond second\nbase.  Cless swung with all his might at the first pitched ball, and\ninstead of hitting it a mile as he had tried, he scratched a mean,\nslow, teasing grounder down the third base line.  It was as safe as if\nit had been shot out of a cannon.  Magoon went to third.\n\nThe crowd suddenly awoke to ominous possibilities; sharp commands came\nfrom the players' bench.  The Philadelphia team were bowling and\nhopping on the side lines, and had to be put down by the umpire.\n\nAn inbreathing silence fell upon stands and field, quiet, like a lull\nbefore a storm.\n\nWhen I saw young Burt start for the plate and realized it was his turn\nat bat, I jumped as if I had been shot.  Putting my hand on Old\nWell-Well's shoulder I whispered:  \"Burt's at bat: He'll break up this\ngame!  I know he's going to lose one!\"\n\nThe old fellow did not feel my touch; he did not hear my voice; he was\ngazing toward the field with an expression on his face to which no\nhuman speech could render justice.  He knew what was coming.  It could\nnot be denied him in that moment.\n\nHow confidently young Burt stood up to the plate!  None except a\nnatural hitter could have had his position.  He might have been Wagner\nfor all he showed of the tight suspense of that crisis.  Yet there was\na tense alert poise to his head and shoulders which proved he was alive\nto his opportunity.\n\nDuveen plainly showed he was tired.  Twice he shook his head to his\ncatcher, as if he did not want to pitch a certain kind of ball.  He had\nto use extra motion to get his old speed, and he delivered a high\nstraight ball that Burt fouled over the grand stand.  The second ball\nmet a similar fate.  All the time the crowd maintained that strange\nwaiting silence.  The umpire threw out a glistening white ball, which\nDuveen rubbed in the dust and spat upon.  Then he wound himself up into\na knot, slowly unwound, and swinging with effort, threw for the plate.\n\nBurt's lithe shoulders swung powerfully.  The meeting of ball and bat\nfairly cracked.  The low driving hit lined over second a rising\nglittering streak, and went far beyond the center fielder.\n\nBleachers and stands uttered one short cry, almost a groan, and then\nstared at the speeding runners.  For an instant, approaching doom could\nnot have been more dreaded.  Magoon scored. Cless was rounding second\nwhen the ball lit.  If Burt was running swiftly when he turned first he\nhad only got started, for then his long sprinter's stride lengthened\nand quickened.  At second he was flying; beyond second he seemed to\nmerge into a gray flitting shadow.\n\nI gripped my seat strangling the uproar within me.  Where was the\napplause?  The fans were silent, choked as I was, but from a different\ncause. Cless crossed the plate with the score that defeated New York;\nstill the tension never laxed until Burt beat the ball home in as\nbeautiful a run as ever thrilled an audience.\n\nIn the bleak dead pause of amazed disappointment Old Well-Well lifted\nhis hulking figure and loomed, towered over the bleachers.  His wide\nshoulders spread, his broad chest expanded, his breath whistled as he\ndrew it in.  One fleeting instant his transfigured face shone with a\nglorious light.  Then, as he threw back his head and opened his lips,\nhis face turned purple, the muscles of his cheeks and jaw rippled and\nstrung, the veins on his forehead swelled into bulging ridges.  Even\nthe back of his neck grew red.\n\n\"Well!--Well!--Well!!!\"\n\nEar-splitting stentorian blast!  For a moment I was deafened.  But I\nheard the echo ringing from the cliff, a pealing clarion call,\nbeautiful and wonderful, winding away in hollow reverberation, then\nbreaking out anew from building to building in clear concatenation.\n\nA sea of faces whirled in the direction of that long unheard yell.\nBurt had stopped statue-like as if stricken in his tracks; then he came\nrunning, darting among the spectators who had leaped the fence.\n\nOld Well-Well stood a moment with slow glance lingering on the tumult\nof emptying bleachers, on the moving mingling colors in the grand\nstand, across the green field to the gray-clad players. He staggered\nforward and fell.\n\nBefore I could move, a noisy crowd swarmed about him, some solicitous,\nmany facetious. Young Burt leaped the fence and forced his way into the\ncircle.  Then they were carrying the old man down to the field and\ntoward the clubhouse. I waited until the bleachers and field were\nempty.  When I finally went out there was a crowd at the gate\nsurrounding an ambulance.  I caught a glimpse of Old Well-Well.  He lay\nwhite and still, but his eyes were open, smiling intently. Young Burt\nhung over him with a pale and agitated face.  Then a bell clanged and\nthe ambulance clattered away.",
