Her mother brought her and, leaving, looked round at us,\nmeeting for an instant each pair of curious eyes with friendly appeal.\n\nWe knew well the enchanted house where she lived--stately, retreated\nfar into large grounds in Jefferson Street; a high brick wall all\nround, and on top of the wall broken glass set in cement.  Behind that\nimpassable barrier which so teased our young audacity were flower-beds\nand \"shrub\" bushes, whose blossoms were wonderfully sweet if held a\nwhile in the closed hand; grape arbors and shade and fruit trees,\nhaunted by bees; winding walks strewn fresh each spring with tan-bark\nthat has such a clean, strong odor, especially just after a rain, and\nthat is at once firm and soft beneath the feet.  And in the midst stood\nthe only apricot tree in Saint X.  As few of us had tasted apricots,\nand as those few pronounced them better far than oranges or even\nbananas, that tree was the climax of tantalization.\n\nThe place had belonged to a childless old couple who hated children--or\ndid they bar them out and drive them away because the sight and sound\nof them quickened the ache of empty old age into a pain too keen to\nbear?  The husband died, the widow went away to her old maid sister at\nMadison; and the Gardiners, coming from Cincinnati to live in the town\nwhere Colonel Gardiner was born and had spent his youth, bought the\nplace.  On our way to and from school in the first weeks of that term,\npausing as always to gaze in through the iron gates of the drive, we\nhad each day seen Pauline walking alone among the flowers.  And she\nwould stop and smile at us; but she was apparently too shy to come to\nthe gates; and we, with the memory of the cross old couple awing us,\ndared not attempt to make friends with her.\n\nShe was eight years old, tall for her age, slender but strong,\nnaturally graceful.  Her hazel eyes were always dancing mischievously.\nShe liked boys' games better than girls'.  In her second week she\ninduced several of the more daring girls to go with her to the pond\nbelow town and there engage in a raft-race with the boys.  And when\nJohn Dumont, seeing that the girls' raft was about to win, thrust the\none he was piloting into it and upset it, she was the only girl who did\nnot scream at the shock of the sudden tumble into the water or rise in\ntears from the shallow, muddy bottom.\n\nShe tried going barefooted; she was always getting bruised or cut in\nattempts--usually successful--at boys' recklessness; yet her voice was\nsweet and her manner toward others, gentle.  She hid her face when Miss\nStone whipped any one--more fearful far than the rise and fall of Miss\nStone's ferule was the soaring and sinking of her broad, bristling\neyebrows.\n\nFrom the outset John Dumont took especial delight in teasing her--John\nDumont, the roughest boy in the school.  He was seven years older than\nshe, but was only in the Fourth Reader--a laggard in his studies\nbecause his mind was incurious about books and the like, was absorbed\nin games, in playing soldier and robber, in swimming and sledding, in\norchard-looting and fighting.  He was impudent and domineering, a bully\nbut not a coward, good-natured when deferred to, the feared leader of a\nboisterous, imitative clique.  Until Pauline came he had rarely noticed\na girl--never except to play her some prank more or less cruel.\n\nAfter the adventure of the raft he watched Pauline afar off, revolving\nplans for approaching her without impairing his barbaric dignity, for\nsubduing her without subduing himself to her.  But he knew only one way\nof making friends, the only kind of friends he had or could\nconceive--loyal subjects, ruled through their weaknesses and fears.\nAnd as that way was to give the desired addition to his court a sound\nthrashing, he felt it must be modified somewhat to help him in his\npresent conquest. He tied her hair to the back of her desk; he\nsnowballed her and his sister Gladys home from school.  He raided her\nplayhouse and broke her dishes and--she giving desperate battle--fled\nwith only the parents of her doll family.  With Gladys shrieking for\ntheir mother, he shook her out of a tree in their yard, and it sprained\nher ankle so severely that she had to stay away from school for a\nmonth.  The net result of a year's arduous efforts was that she had\nsingled him out for detestation--this when her conquest of him was\ncomplete because she had never told on him, had never in her worst\nencounters with him shown the white feather.\n\nBut he had acted more wisely than he knew, for she had at least singled\nhim out from the crowd of boys.  And there was a certain frank\ngood-nature about him, a fearlessness--and she could not help admiring\nhis strength and leadership.  Presently she discovered his secret--that\nhis persecutions were not through hatred of her but through anger at\nher resistance, anger at his own weakness in being fascinated by her.\nThis discovery came while she was shut in the house with her sprained\nankle.  As she sat at her corner bay-window she saw him hovering in the\nneighborhood, now in the alley at the side of the house, now hurrying\npast, whistling loudly as if bent upon some gay and remote errand, now\nskulking along as if he had stolen something, again seated on the\ncurbstone at the farthest crossing from which he could see her window\nout of the corner of his eye.  She understood--and forthwith forgave\nthe past.  She was immensely flattered that this big, audacious\ncreature, so arrogant with the boys, so contemptuous toward the girls,\nshould be her captive.\n\nWhen she was in her first year at the High School and he in his last he\nwalked home with her every day; and they regarded themselves as\nengaged.  Her once golden hair had darkened now to a beautiful brown\nwith red flashing from its waves; and her skin was a clear olive pallid\nbut healthy.  And she had shot up into a tall, slender young woman; her\nmother yielded to her pleadings, let her put her hair into a long knot\nat the back of her neck and wear skirts ALMOST to the ground.\n\nWhen he came from Ann Arbor for his first Christmas holidays each found\nthe other grown into a new person.  She thought him a marvel of wisdom\nand worldly experience.  He thought her a marvel of ideal\nwomanhood--gay, lively; not a bit \"narrow\" in judging him, yet narrow\nto primness in her ideas of what she herself could do, and withal\ncharming physically.  He would not have cared to explain how he came by\nthe capacity for such sophisticated judgment of a young woman.  They\nwere to be married as soon as he had his degree; and he was immediately\nto be admitted to partnership in his father's woolen mills--the largest\nin the state of Indiana.\n\nHe had been home three weeks of the long vacation between his sophomore\nand junior years.  There appeared on the town's big and busy stream of\ngossip, stories of his life at Ann Arbor--of drinking and gambling and\nwild \"tears\" in Detroit.  And it was noted that the fast young men of\nSaint X--so every one called Saint Christopher--were going a more rapid\ngait.  Those turbulent fretters against the dam of dullness and stern\nrepression of even normal and harmless gaiety had long caused scandal.\nBut never before had they been so daring, so defiant.\n\nOne night after leaving Pauline he went to play poker in Charley\nBraddock's rooms.  Braddock, only son of the richest banker in Saint X,\nhad furnished the loft of his father's stable as bachelor quarters and\nentertained his friends there without fear that the noise would break\nthe sleep and rouse the suspicions of his father.  That night, besides\nBraddock and Dumont, there were Jim Cauldwell and his brother Will.  As\nthey played they drank; and Dumont, winning steadily, became offensive\nin his raillery. There was a quarrel, a fight; Will Cauldwell,\naccidently toppled down a steep stairway by Dumont, was picked up with\na broken arm and leg.\n\nBy noon the next day the town was boiling with this outbreak of\ndeviltry in the leading young men, the sons and prospective successors\nof the \"bulwarks of religion and morality.\"  The Episcopalian and\nMethodist ministers preached against Dumont, that \"importer of Satan's\nways into our peaceful midst,\" and against Charley Braddock with his\n\"ante-room to Sheol\"--the Reverend Sweetser had just learned the\ndistinction between Sheol and Hades.  The Presbyterian preacher\nwrestled spiritually with Will Cauldwell and so wrought upon his\ndepression that he gave out a solemn statement of confession, remorse\nand reform.  In painting himself in dark colors he painted Jack Dumont\njet black.\n\nPauline had known that Dumont was \"lively\"--he was far too proud of his\nwild oats wholly to conceal them from her.  And she had all the\ntolerance and fascinated admiration of feminine youth for the\nfriskiness of masculine freedom.  Thus, though she did not precisely\napprove what he and his friends had done, she took no such serious view\nof it as did her parents and his.  The most she could do with her\nfather was to persuade him to suspend sentence pending the conclusion\nof an investigation into Jack's doings at the University of Michigan\nand in Detroit.  Colonel Gardiner was not so narrow or so severe as\nJack said or as Pauline thought.  He loved his daughter; so he inquired\nthoroughly.  He knew that his daughter loved Dumont; so he judged\nliberally.  When he had done he ordered the engagement broken and\nforbade Dumont the house.\n\n\"He is not wild merely; he is--worse than you can imagine,\" said the\ncolonel to his wife, in concluding his account of his discoveries and\nof Dumont's evasive and reluctant admissions--an account so carefully\nexpurgated that it completely misled her. \"Tell Pauline as much as you\ncan--enough to convince her.\"\n\nThis, when Mrs. Gardiner was not herself convinced.  She regarded the\ncolonel as too high-minded to be a fit judge of human frailty; and his\nover-caution in explanation had given her the feeling that he had a\nstandard for a husband for their daughter which only another such rare\nman as himself could live up to. Further, she had always been extremely\nreserved in mother-and-daughter talk with Pauline, and thus could not\nnow give her a clear idea of what little she had been able to gather\nfrom Colonel Gardiner's half-truths.  This typical enacting of a\nfamiliar domestic comedy-tragedy had the usual result: the girl was\nconfirmed in her original opinion and stand.\n\n\"Jack's been a little too lively,\" was her unexpressed conclusion from\nher mother's dilution of her father's dilution of the ugly truth.\n\"He's sorry and won't do it again, and--well, I'd hate a milksop.\nFather has forgotten that he was young himself once.\"\n\nDumont's father and mother charged against Ann Arbor that which they\nmight have charged against their own alternations of tyranny and\nlicense, had they not been humanly lenient in self-excuse. \"No more\ncollege!\" said his father.\n\n\"The place for you, young man, is my office, where I can keep an eye or\ntwo on you.\"\n\n\"That suits me,\" replied the son, indifferently--he made small pretense\nof repentance at home.\n\n\"I never wanted to go to college.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was your mother's doing,\" said old Dumont.  \"Now we'll try MY\nway of educating a boy.\"\n\nSo Jack entered the service of his father's god-of-the-six-days, and\nimmediately showed astonishing talent and twelve-to-fourteen-hour\nassiduity.  He did not try to talk with Pauline.  He went nowhere but\nto business; he avoided the young men.\n\n\"It's a bad idea to let your home town know too much about you,\" he\nreflected, and he resolved that his future gambols out of bounds should\nbe in the security of distant and large cities--and they were.  Seven\nmonths after he went to work he amazed and delighted his father by\ninforming him that he had bought five hundred shares of stock in the\nmills--he had made the money, fifty-odd thousand dollars, by a\nspeculation in wool.  He was completely reestablished with his father\nand with all Saint X except Colonel Gardiner.\n\n\"That young Jack Dumont's a wonder,\" said everybody.  \"He'll make the\nbiggest kind of a fortune or the biggest kind of a smash before he gets\nthrough.\"\n\nHe felt that he was fully entitled to the rights of the regenerate; he\nwent to Colonel Gardiner's law office boldly to claim them.\n\nAt sight of him the colonel's face hardened into an expression as near\nto hate as its habit of kindliness would concede.  \"Well, sir!\" said\nhe, sharply, eying the young man over the tops of his glasses.\n\nDumont stiffened his strong, rather stocky figure and said, his face a\nstudy of youthful frankness:  \"You know what I've come for, sir.  I\nwant you to give me a trial.\"\n\n\"No!\" Colonel Gardiner shut his lips firmly.\n\n\"Good morning, sir!\"  And he was writing again.\n\n\"You are very hard,\" said Dumont, bitterly.\n\n\"You are driving me to ruin.\"\n\n\"How DARE you!\"  The old man rose and went up to him, eyes blazing\nscorn.  \"You deceive others, but not me with my daughter's welfare as\nmy first duty.  It is an insult to her that you presume to lift your\neyes to her.\"\n\nDumont colored and haughtily raised his head.  He met the colonel's\nfiery gaze without flinching.\n\n\"I was no worse than other young men--\"\n\n\"It's a slander upon young men for you to say that they--that any of\nthem with a spark of decency--would do as you have done, as you DO!\nLeave my office at once, sir!\"\n\n\"I've not only repented--I've shown that I was ashamed of--of that,\"\nsaid Dumont.  \"Yet you refuse me a chance!\"\n\nThe colonel was shaking with anger.\n\n\"You left here for New York last Thursday night,\" he said. \"Where and\nhow did you spend Saturday night and Sunday and Monday?\"\n\nDumont's eyes shifted and sank.\n\n\"It's false,\" he muttered.  \"It's lies.\"\n\n\"I expected this call from you,\" continued Colonel Gardiner, \"and I\nprepared for it so that I could do what was right.  I'd rather see my\ndaughter in her shroud than in a wedding-dress for you.\"\n\nDumont left without speaking or looking up.\n\n\"The old fox!\" he said to himself.  \"Spying on me--what an idiot I was\nnot to look out for that.  The narrow old fool!  He doesn't know what\n'man of the world' means.  But I'll marry her in spite of him.  I'll\nlet nobody cheat me out of what I want, what belongs to me.\"\n\nA few nights afterward he went to a dance at Braddock's, hunted out\nPauline and seated himself beside her.  In a year he had not been so\nnear her, though they had seen each other every few days and he had\nwritten her many letters which she had read, had treasured, but had\nbeen held from answering by her sense of honor, unless her looks\nwhenever their eyes met could be called answers.\n\n\"You mustn't, Jack,\" she said, her breath coming fast, her eyes\nfever-bright.  \"Father has forbidden me--and it'll only make him the\nharder.\"\n\n\"You, too, Polly?  Well, then, I don't care what becomes of me.\"\n\nHe looked so desperate that she was frightened.\n\n\"It isn't that, Jack--you KNOW it isn't that.\"\n\n\"I've been to see your father.  And he told me he'd never\nconsent--never!  I don't deserve that--and I can't stand it to lose\nyou.  No matter what I've done, God knows I love you, Polly.\"\n\nPauline's face was pale.  Her hands, in her lap, were gripping her\nlittle handkerchief.\n\n\"You don't say that, too--you don't say 'never'?\"\n\nShe raised her eyes to his and their look thrilled through and through\nhim.  \"Yes, John, I say 'never'--I'll NEVER give you up.\"\n\nAll the decent instincts in his nature showed in his handsome face, in\nwhich time had not as yet had the chance clearly to write character.\n\"No wonder I love you--there never was anybody so brave and so true as\nyou.  But you must help me. I must see you and talk to you--once in a\nwhile, anyhow.\"\n\nPauline flushed painfully.\n\n\"Not till--they--let me--or I'm older, John.  They've always trusted me\nand left me free.  And I can't deceive them.\"\n\nHe liked this--it was another proof that she was, through and through,\nthe sort of woman who was worthy to be his wife.\n\n\"Well--we'll wait,\" he said.  \"And if they won't be fair to us, why,\nwe'll have a right to do the best we can.\"  He gave her a tragic look.\n\n\"I've set my heart on you, Polly, and I never can stand it not to get\nwhat I've set my heart on.  If I lost you, I'd go straight to ruin.\"\n\nShe might have been a great deal older and wiser and still not have\nseen in this a confirmation of her father's judgment of her lover.  And\nher parents had unconsciously driven her into a mental state in which,\nif he had committed a crime, it would have seemed to her their fault\nrather than his.  The next day she opened the subject with her\nmother--the subject that was never out of their minds.\n\n\"I can't forget him, mother.  I CAN'T give him up.\"  With the splendid\nconfidence of youth, \"I can save him--he'll do anything for my sake.\"\nWith the touching ignorance of youth, \"He's done nothing so very\ndreadful, I'm sure--I'd believe him against the whole world.\"\n\nAnd in the evening her mother approached her father.  She was in\nsympathy with Pauline, though her loyalty to her husband made her\ncareful not to show it.  She had small confidence in a man's judgments\nof men on their woman-side, great confidence in the power of women to\nchange and uplift men.\n\n\"Father,\" said she, when they were alone on the side porch after\nsupper, \"have you noticed how hard Polly is taking IT?\"\n\nHis eyes and the sudden deepening of the lines in his face answered her.\n\n\"Don't you think maybe we've been a little--too--severe?\"\n\n\"I've tried to think so, but--\"  He shook his head.  \"Maggie, he's\nhopeless, hopeless.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about those things.\"  This was a mere form of\nspeech.  She thought she knew all there was to be known; and as she was\nan intelligent woman who had lived a long time and had a normal human\ncuriosity she did know a great deal.  But, after the fashion of many of\nthe women of the older generation, she had left undisturbed his\ndelusion that her goodness was the result not of intelligence but of\nignorance.  \"But I can't help fearing it isn't right to condemn a young\nman forever because he was led away as a boy.\"\n\n\"I can't discuss it with you, Maggie--it's a degradation even to speak\nof him before a good woman.  You must rely upon my judgment.  Polly\nmust put him out of her head.\"\n\n\"But what am I to tell her?  You can't make a woman like our Pauline\nput a man out of her life when she loves him unless you give her a\nreason that satisfies her.  And if you don't give ME a reason that\nsatisfies me how can I give HER a reason that will satisfy her?\"\n\n\"I'll talk to her,\" said the colonel, after a long pause. \"She\nmust--she shall give him up, mother.\"\n\n\"I've tried to persuade her to go to visit Olivia,\" continued Mrs.\nGardiner.  \"But she won't.  And she doesn't want me to ask Olivia here.\"\n\n\"I'll ask Olivia before I speak to her.\"\n\nMrs. Gardiner went up to her daughter's room--it had been her\nplay-room, then her study, and was now graduated into her sitting-room.\nShe was dreaming over a book--Tennyson's poems. She looked up, eyes\nfull of hope.\n\n\"He has some good reason, dear,\" began her mother.\n\n\"What is it?\" demanded Pauline.\n\n\"I can't tell you any more than I've told you already,\" replied her\nmother, trying not to show her feelings in her face.\n\n\"Why does he treat me--treat you--like two naughty little children?\"\nsaid Pauline, impatiently tossing the book on the table.\n\n\"Pauline!\"  Her mother's voice was sharp in reproof.  \"How can you\nplace any one before your father!\"\n\nPauline was silent--she had dropped the veil over herself. \"I--I--where\ndid you place father--when--when--\"  Her eyes were laughing again.\n\n\"You know he'd never oppose your happiness, Polly.\"  Mrs. Gardiner was\nsmoothing her daughter's turbulent red-brown hair. \"You'll only have to\nwait under a little more trying circumstances.  And if he's right, the\ntruth will come out.  And if he's mistaken and John's all you think\nhim, then that will come out.\"\n\nPauline knew her father was not opposing her through tyranny or pride\nof opinion or sheer prejudice; but she felt that this was another case\nof age's lack of sympathy with youth, felt it with all the intensity of\ninfatuated seventeen made doubly determined by opposition and\nconcealment.  The next evening he and she were walking together in the\ngarden.  He suddenly put his arm round her and drew her close to him\nand kissed her.\n\n\"You know I shouldn't if I didn't think it the only course--don't you,\nPauline?\" he said in a broken voice that went straight to her heart.\n\n\"Yes, father.\"  Then, after a silence:  \"But--we--we've been\nsweethearts since we were children.  And--I--father, I MUST stand by\nhim.\"\n\n\"Won't you trust me, child?  Won't you believe ME rather than him?\"\n\nPauline's only answer was a sigh.  They loved each the other; he adored\nher, she reverenced him.  But between them, thick and high, rose the\nbarrier of custom and training.  Comradeship, confidence were\nimpossible.\n\n\n\nII.\n\nOLIVIA TO THE RESCUE.\n\nWith the first glance into Olivia's dark gray eyes Pauline ceased to\nresent her as an intruder.  And soon she was feeling that some sort of\ndawn was assailing her night.\n\nOlivia was the older by three years.  She seemed--and for her years,\nwas--serious and wise because, as the eldest of a large family, she was\nlieutenant-general to her mother.  Further, she had always had her own\nway--when it was the right way and did not conflict with justice to her\nbrothers and sisters.  And often her parents let her have her own way\nwhen it was the wrong way, nor did they spoil the lesson by mitigating\ndisagreeable consequences.\n\n\"Do as you please,\" her mother used to say, when doing as she pleased\nwould involve less of mischief than of valuable experience, \"and\nperhaps you'll learn to please to do sensibly.\"  Again, her father\nwould restrain her mother from interference--\"Oh, let the girl alone.\nShe's got to teach herself how to behave, and she can't begin a minute\ntoo young.\" This training had produced a self-reliant and\nself-governing Olivia.\n\nShe wondered at the change in Pauline--Pauline, the light-hearted, the\neffervescent of laughter and life, now silent and almost somber.  It\nwas two weeks before she, not easily won to the confiding mood for all\nher frankness, let Olivia into her secret.  Of course, it was at night;\nof course, they were in the same bed.  And when Olivia had heard she\ncame nearer to the truth about Dumont than had Pauline's mother.  But,\nwhile she felt sure there was a way to cure Pauline, she knew that way\nwas not the one which had been pursued.  \"They've only made her\nobstinate,\" she thought, as she, lying with hands clasped behind her\nhead, watched Pauline, propped upon an elbow, staring with dreamful\ndetermination into the moonlight.\n\n\"It'll come out all right,\" she said; her voice always suggested that\nshe knew what she was talking about.  \"Your father'll give in sooner or\nlater--if YOU don't change.\"\n\n\"But he's so bitter against Jack,\" replied Pauline.  \"He won't listen\nto his side--to our side--of it.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, what's the use of anticipating trouble?  You wouldn't get\nmarried yet.  And if he's worthwhile he'll wait.\"\n\nPauline had been even gentler than her own judgment in painting her\nlover for her cousin's inspection.  So, she could not explain to her\nwhy there was necessity for haste, could not confess her conviction\nthat every month he lived away from her was a month of peril to him.\n\n\"We want it settled,\" she said evasively.\n\n\"I haven't seen him around anywhere,\" went on Olivia.  \"Is he here now?\"\n\n\"He's in Chicago--in charge of his father's office there.  He may stay\nall winter.\"\n\n\"No, there's no hurry,\" went on Olivia.  \"Besides, you ought to meet\nother men.  It isn't a good idea for a girl to marry the man she's been\nbrought up with before she's had a chance to get acquainted with other\nmen.\"  Olivia drew this maxim from experience--she had been engaged to\na school-days lover when she went away to Battle Field to college; she\nbroke it off when, going home on vacation, she saw him again from the\npoint of wider view.\n\nBut Pauline scorned this theory; if Olivia had confessed the broken\nengagement she would have thought her shallow and untrustworthy.  She\nwas confident, with inexperience's sublime incapacity for self-doubt,\nthat in all the wide world there was only one man whom she could have\nloved or could love.\n\n\"Oh, I shan't change,\" she said in a tone that warned her cousin\nagainst discussion.\n\n\"At any rate,\" replied Olivia, \"a little experience would do you no\nharm.\"  She suddenly sat up in bed.  \"A splendid idea!\" she exclaimed.\n\"Why not come to Battle Field with me?\"\n\n\"I'd like it,\" said Pauline, always eager for self-improvement and\nroused by Olivia's stories of her college experiences.  \"But father'd\nnever let me go to Battle Field College.\"\n\n\"Battle Field UNIVERSITY,\" corrected Olivia.  \"It has classical courses\nand scientific courses and a preparatory school--and a military\ndepartment for men and a music department for women.  And it's going to\nhave lots and lots of real university schools--when it gets the money.\nAnd there's a healthy, middle-aged wagon-maker who's said to be\nthinking of leaving it a million or so--if he should ever die and if\nthey should change its name to his.\"\n\n\"But it's coeducation, isn't it?  Father would never consent. It was\nall mother could do to persuade him to let me go to public school.\"\n\n\"But maybe he'd let you go with me, where he wouldn't let you go all\nalone.\"\n\nAnd so it turned out.  Colonel Gardiner, anxious to get his daughter\naway from Saint X and into new scenes where Dumont might grow dim,\nconsented as soon as Olivia explained her plan.\n\n\nInstead of entering \"senior prep\", Pauline was able to make freshman\nwith only three conditions.  In the first week she was initiated into\nOlivia's fraternity, the Kappa Alpha Kappa, joined the woman's literary\nand debating society, and was fascinated and absorbed by crowding new\nevents, associations, occupations, thoughts.  In spite of herself her\nold-time high spirits came flooding back.  She caught herself\nhumming--and checked herself reproachfully.  She caught herself\nsinging--and lowered it to humming.  She caught herself whistling--and\ndecided that she might as well be cheerful while she waited for fate to\nbefriend her and Jack.  And she found that she thought about him none\nthe less steadfastly for thinking hopefully.\n\nBattle Field put no more restraint upon its young women than it put\nupon its young men--and it put no restraint upon the young men.  In\ntheory and practice it was democratic, American, western--an outgrowth\nof that pioneer life in which the men and the women had fought and\ntoiled and enjoyed, side by side, in absolute equality, with absolute\nfreedom of association.  It recognized that its students had been\nbrought up in the free, simple, frank way, that all came from a region\nwhere individualism was a religion, with self-reliance as the cardinal\nprinciple of faith and self-development as the goal.\n\nThere were no dormitories at Battle Field then.  Olivia and Pauline\nlived in one of the hundred or more boarding-houses--a big, square,\nwhite \"frame,\" kept by a Mrs. Trent, the widow of a \"hero of two wars.\"\n\nHer hero had won her with his uniform when he returned from the Mexican\nWar.  His conduct was so irregular and his income so uncertain that it\nhad been a relief to her when he departed for his second war.  From it\nhe had brought home a broken constitution, a maimed body and confirmed\nhabits of shiftlessness and drunkenness.  His country took his\ncharacter and his health and paid him in exchange a pension which just\nabout kept him in whisky and tobacco.  So long as he was alive Mrs.\nTrent hated him as vigorously as her Christianity permitted.  When he\nwas safely in his grave she canonized him; she put his picture and his\nsword, belt and epaulets in the conspicuous place in the parlor; she\nused his record for gallantry to get herself social position and a\nplace of honor at public gatherings.\n\nHer house stood back from the highway in a grove of elms and walnuts.\nIts angularity was relieved by a porch with a flat roof that had a\nrailing about it and served as a balcony for the second-story lodgers.\nThere were broad halls through the middle of the house down-stairs and\nup.  Olivia and Pauline had the three large rooms in the second story\non the south side.  They used the front room as a study and Pauline's\nbedroom was next to it.\n\nLate one afternoon she was seated at the study window watching a\ncherry-red sun drop through the purple haze of the autumn.  She became\nconscious that some one was on the balcony before the window of the\nfront room across the hall.  She leaned so that she could see without\nbeing seen.  Sharp against the darkening sky was the profile of a young\nman.  Olivia joined her and followed her glance.  The profile remained\nfixed and the two girls watched it, fascinated.  It certainly was a\npowerful outline, proud and stern, but with a mouth that was sweet in\nits kindliness and gentleness.\n\n\"I wonder what he's thinking about,\" said Olivia, in an undertone; he\nwas not fifteen feet from them.  \"I suppose, some scheme for conquering\nthe world.\"\n\nMost of Battle Field's youth came from the farms of that western\ncountry, the young men with bodies and brains that were strong but\nawkward.  Almost all were working their way through--as were not a few\nof the women.  They felt that life was a large, serious business\nimpatiently waiting for them to come and attend to it in a large,\nserious way better than it had ever been attended to before.  They\nstudied hard; they practised oratory and debating. Their talk was of\nhistory and philosophy, religion and politics. They slept little; they\nthought--or tried to think--even more than they talked.\n\nAt a glance this man was one of them, a fine type.\n\n\"He's handsome, isn't he?\" said Pauline.\n\n\"But--\"  She did not finish; indeed it was not clear to her what the\nrest of her protest was.  He reminded her of Dumont--there was the same\nlook of superiority, of the \"born to lead.\"  But his face seemed to,\nhave some quality which Dumont's lacked--or was it only the idealizing\neffect of the open sky and the evening light?\n\nWhen the bell rang for supper he apparently did not hear it.  The two\ngirls went down and had talked to the others a few minutes and all had\nseated themselves before he entered.  An inch or so above six feet,\npowerful in the chest and shoulders, he moved with a large grace until\nhe became self-conscious or approached the, by comparison, frail pieces\nof furniture.  He had penetrating, candid eyes that looked dark in the\ngaslight but were steel-blue.  His face now wore the typical\nwestern-American expression--shrewd, easy-going good humor.  Mrs.\nTrent, intrenched in state behind a huge, silver-plated coffee-urn with\nivory-trimmed faucet, introduced him--Mr. Scarborough--to Olivia, to\nPauline, to Sadie McIntosh, to Pierson and Howe and Thiebaud\n(pronounced Cay-bo).  Scarborough sat directly opposite Olivia. But\nwhenever he lifted his eyes from his plate he looked at Pauline, who\nwas next to her.  When she caught him he blushed and stirred in his\nchair so uneasily that it creaked and crackled; and his normal\ndifficulties with his large hands and the small knife and fork were\ndistressingly increased.\n\nPauline was disappointed in him--his clothes were ill-fitting and gave\nhim the appearance of being in danger of bursting from them; his hair\nwas too long, suggesting a shaggy, tawny mane; though his hands were\nwell-shaped they had the recent scars of hard manual labor.  Thus, when\nOlivia spoke enthusiastically of him after supper, she made no reply.\nShe would have been ashamed to acknowledge the reasons for her lack of\nadmiration, even had she been conscious of them.\n\nBut the next morning at breakfast she revised her opinion somewhat.  He\ntalked, and he had a remarkable voice--clear, musical, with a quality\nwhich made it seem to penetrate through all the nerves instead of\nthrough the auditory nerve only. Further, he talked straight to\nPauline, without embarrassment and with a quaint, satiric humor.  She\nwas forgetting for the moment his almost uncouth hair and dress when,\nin making a sweeping gesture, he upset a glass of water and sent a\nplate of hot bread flying from the waitress' hand.\n\n\"He'd do well in the open air,\" thought she, \"but he's out of place in\na house.\"\n\nStill, she found him interesting and original.  And he persistently\nsought her--his persistence was little short of heroism in view of the\nnever-wholly-concealed sufferings which the contrast between her grace\nand style and his lack of both caused him.\n\n\"He looks like a king who had been kidnapped as a child and brought up\nin the wilds,\" said Olivia.  \"I wonder who he is.\"\n\n\"I'll ask him,\" replied Pauline.  And Olivia was slyly amused by her\ncousin's unconscious pride in her power with this large, untamed person.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nAND SCARBOROUGH.\n\nHis name was Hampden Scarborough and he came from a farm about twenty\nmiles east of Saint X.  He was descended from men who had learned to\nhate kings in Holland in the sixteenth century, had learned to despise\nthem in England in the seventeenth century, had learned to laugh at\nthem in America in the eighteenth century, had learned to exalt\nthemselves into kings--the kings of the new democracy--in the free West\nin the nineteenth century.\n\nWhen any one asked his father, Bladen Scarborough, who the family\nancestors were, Bladen usually did not answer at all.  It was his habit\nthus to treat a question he did not fancy, and, if the question was\nrepeated, to supplement silence with a piercing look from under his\naggressive eyebrows.  But sometimes he would answer it.  Once, for\nexample, he looked coldly at the man who, with a covert sneer, had\nasked it, said, \"You're impudent, sir. You insinuate I'm not enough by\nmyself to command your consideration,\" and struck him a staggering blow\nacross the mouth.  Again--he was in a playful mood that day and the\nquestioner was a woman--he replied, \"I'm descended from murderers,\nma'am--murderers.\"\n\nAnd in a sense it was the truth.\n\nIn 1568 the Scarboroughs were seated obscurely in an east county of\nEngland.  They were tenant farmers on the estates of the Earl of\nAshford and had been strongly infected with \"leveling\" ideas by the\nrefugees then fleeing to England to escape the fury of continental\nprince and priest.  John Scarborough was trudging along the highway\nwith his sister Kate.  On horseback came Aubrey Walton, youngest son of\nthe Earl of Ashford.  He admired the rosy, pretty face of Kate\nScarborough.  He dismounted and, without so much as a glance at her\nbrother, put his arm round her.  John snatched her free.  Young Walton,\nall amazement and wrath at the hind who did not appreciate the favor he\nwas condescending to bestow upon a humble maiden, ripped out an insult\nand drew his sword.  John wrenched it from him and ran it through his\nbody.\n\nThat night, with four gold pieces in his pocket, John Scarborough left\nEngland in a smuggler and was presently fighting Philip of Spain in the\narmy of the Dutch people.\n\nIn 1653 Zachariah Scarborough, great grandson of the preceding, was a\nsoldier in Cromwell's army.  On the night of April twentieth he was in\nan ale-house off Fleet Street with three brother officers.  That day\nCromwell had driven out Parliament and had dissolved the Council of\nState.  Three of the officers were of Cromwell's party; the fourth,\nCaptain Zachariah Scarborough, was a \"leveler\"--a hater of kings, a\nDutch-bred pioneer of Dutch-bred democracy.  The discussion began\nhot--and they poured ale on it.\n\n\"He's a tyrant!\" shouted Zachariah Scarborough, bringing his huge fist\ndown on the table and upsetting a mug.  \"He has set up for king.  Down\nwith all kings, say I!  His head must come off!\"\n\nAt this knives were drawn, and when Zachariah Scarborough staggered\ninto the darkness of filthy Fleet Street with a cut down his cheek from\ntemple to jaw-bone, his knife was dripping the life of a cousin of\nIreton's.\n\nHe fled to the Virginia plantations and drifted thence to North\nCarolina.\n\nHis great-grandson, Gaston Scarborough, was one of Marion's men in his\nboyhood--a fierce spirit made arrogant by isolated freedom, where every\nman of character owned his land and could conceive of no superior\nbetween him and Almighty God.  One autumn day in 1794 Gaston was out\nshooting with his youngest brother, John, their father's favorite.\nGaston's gun was caught by a creeper, was torn from him; and his hand,\nreaching for it, exploded the charge into his brother's neck.  His\nbrother fell backward into the swamp and disappeared.\n\nGaston plunged into the wilderness--to Tennessee, to Kentucky, to\nIndiana.\n\n\n\"And it's my turn,\" said Hampden Scarborough as he ended a brief\nrecital of the ancestral murders which Pauline had drawn from him--they\nwere out for a walk together.\n\n\"Your turn?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Yes--I'm the great-grandson--the only one.  It's always a\ngreat-grandson.\"\n\n\"You DO look dangerous,\" said Pauline, and the smile and the glance she\nsent with the words might have been misunderstood by a young man\nentertaining the ideas which were then filling that young man's brain.\n\nAgain, he told her how he had been sent to college--she was always\nleading him to talk of himself, and her imagination more than supplied\nthat which his unaffected modesty, sometimes deliberately, more often\nunconsciously, kept out of his stories.\n\nEver since he could remember, his strongest passion had been for books,\nfor reading.  Before he was born the wilderness was subdued and the\ncruel toil of his parents' early life was mitigated by the growth of\ntowns, the spread of civilization. There was a chance for some leisure,\nfor the higher gratification of the intense American passion for\neducation.  A small library had sprung up in one corner of the general\nroom of the old farm-house--from the seeds of a Bible, an almanac,\nMilton's Paradise Lost, Baxter's Saint's Rest and a Government report\non cattle.  But the art collection had stood still for years--a\nfacsimile of the Declaration of Independence, another of the\nEmancipation Proclamation, pictures of Washington, Lincoln and\nNapoleon, the last held in that household second only to Washington in\nall history as a \"leveler.\"\n\nThe only daughter, Arabella, had been sent to boarding-school in\nCincinnati.  She married a rich man, lived in the city and, under the\ninspiration of English novels and the tutelage of a woman friend who\nvisited in New York and often went abroad, was developing ideas of\nfamily and class and rank.  She talked feelingly of the \"lower classes\"\nand of the duty of the \"upper class\" toward them.  Her \"goings-on\"\ncreated an acid prejudice against higher education in her father's\nmind.  As she was unfolding to him a plan for sending Hampden to\nHarvard he interrupted with, \"No MORE idiots in my family at my\nexpense,\" and started out to feed the pigs.  The best terms Hampden's\nmother could make were that he should not be disinherited and cast off\nif he went to Battle Field and paid his own way.\n\nHe did not tell Pauline all of this, nor did he repeat to her the\nconversation between himself and his father a few days before he left\nhome.\n\n\"Is 'Bella going to pay your way through?\" asked his father, looking at\nhim severely--but he looked severely at every one except Hampden's\ngentle-voiced mother.\n\n\"No, sir.\"  The son's voice was clear.\n\n\"Is your mother?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Have you got money put by?\"\n\n\"Four hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"Is that enough?\"\n\n\"It'll give me time for a long look around.\"\n\nThe old man drew a big, rusty pocketbook from the inside pocket of the\nold-fashioned, flowered-velvet waistcoat he wore even when he fed the\npigs.  He counted out upon his knee ten one-hundred-dollar bills.  He\nheld them toward his son. \"That'll have to do you,\" he said.  \"That's\nall you'll get.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" replied Hampden.  \"I wish no favors from anybody.\"\n\n\"You've earned it over and above your keep,\" retorted his father.  \"It\nbelongs to you.\"\n\n\"If I need it I'll send for it,\" said Hampden, that being the easiest\nway quickly to end the matter.\n\nBut he did tell Pauline that he purposed to pay his own way through\ncollege.\n\n\"My father has a notion,\" said he, \"that the things one works for and\nearns are the only things worth having.  And I think one can't begin to\nact on that notion too early.  If one is trying to get an education,\nwhy not an all-round education, instead of only lessons out of books?\"\n\nFrom that moment Pauline ceased to regard dress or any other external\nfeature as a factor in her estimate of Hampden Scarborough.\n\n\"But your plan might make a man too late in getting a start--some men,\nat least,\" she suggested.\n\n\"A start--for what?\" he asked.\n\n\"For fame or fortune or success of any kind.\"\n\nScarborough's eyes, fixed on the distance, had a curious look in\nthem--he was again exactly like that first view she had had of him.\n\n\"But suppose one isn't after any of those things,\" he said. \"Suppose he\nthinks of life as simply an opportunity for self-development.  He\nstarts at it when he's born, and the more of it he does the more he has\nto do.  And--he can't possibly fail, and every moment is a\ntriumph--and----\"  He came back from his excursion and smiled\napologetically at her.\n\nBut she was evidently interested.\n\n\"Don't you think a man ought to have ambition?\" she asked.  She was\nthinking of her lover  and his audacious schemes for making himself\npowerful.\n\n\"Oh--a man is what he is.  Ambition means so many different things.\"\n\n\"But shouldn't you like to be rich and famous and--all that?\"\n\n\"It depends----\"  Scarborough felt that if he said what was in his mind\nit might sound like cant.  So he changed the subject. \"Just now my\nambition is to get off that zoology condition.\"\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nA DUMONT TRIUMPH.\n\nBut in the first week of her second month Pauline's interest in her\nsurroundings vanished.  She was corresponding with Jennie Atwater and\nJennie began to write of Dumont--he had returned to Saint X; Caroline\nSylvester, of Cleveland, was visiting his mother; it was all but\ncertain that Jack and Caroline would marry.  \"Her people want it,\"\nJennie went on--she pretended to believe that Jack and Pauline had\ngiven each the other up--\"and Jack's father is determined on it.\nThey're together morning, noon and evening.  She's really very swell,\nthough _I_ don't think she's such a raving beauty.\"  Following this\ncame the Saint X News-Bulletin with a broad hint that the engagement\nwas about to be announced.\n\n\"It's ridiculously false,\" said Pauline to herself; but she tossed for\nhours each night, trying to soothe the sick pain in her heart.  And\nwhile she scouted the possibility of losing him, she was for the first\ntime entertaining it--a cloud in the great horizon of her faith in the\nfuture; a small cloud, but black and bold against the blue.  And she\nhad no suspicion that he had returned from Chicago deliberately to\nraise that cloud.\n\nA few days later another letter from Jennie, full of gossip about Jack\nand Caroline, a News-Bulletin with a long article about Caroline,\nending with an even broader hint of her approaching marriage--and\nDumont sent Pauline a note from the hotel in Villeneuve, five miles\nfrom Battle Field:  \"I must see you.  Do not deny me.  It means\neverything to both of us--what I want to say to you.\"  And he asked her\nto meet him in the little park in Battle Field on the bank of the river\nwhere no one but the factory hands and their families ever went, and\nthey only in the evenings.  The hour he fixed was ten the next morning,\nand she \"cut\" ancient history and was there.  As he advanced to meet\nher she thought she had never before appreciated how handsome he was,\nhow distinguished-looking--perfectly her ideal of what a man should be,\nespecially in that important, and at Battle Field neglected, matter,\ndress.\n\nShe was without practice in indirection, but she successfully hid her\njealousy and her fears, though his manner was making their taunts and\nthreats desperately real.  He seemed depressed and gloomy; he would not\nlook at her; he shook hands with her almost coldly, though they had not\nseen each other for weeks, had not talked together for months.  She\nfelt faint, and her thoughts were like flocks of circling, croaking\ncrows.\n\n\"Polly,\" he began, when they were in the secluded corner of the park,\n\"father wants me to get married.  He's in a rage at your father for\ntreating me so harshly.  He wants me to marry a girl who's visiting us.\nHe's always at me about it, making all sorts of promises and threats.\nHer father's in the same business that we are, and----\"\n\nHe glanced at her to note the effect of his words.  She had drawn her\ntall figure to its full height, and her cheeks were flushed and her\neyes curiously bright.  He had stabbed straight and deep into the heart\nof her weakness, but also into the heart of her pride.\n\nThe only effect of his thrust that was visible to him put him in a\npanic.  \"Don't--PLEASE don't look that way, Polly,\" he went on hastily.\n\"You don't see what I'm driving at yet.  I didn't mean that I'd marry\nher, or think of it.  There isn't anybody but you.  There couldn't be,\nyou know that.\"\n\n\"Why did you tell me, then?\" she asked haughtily.\n\n\"Because--I had to begin somewhere.  Polly, I'm going away, going\nabroad.  And I'm not to see you for--for I don't know how long--and--we\nmust be married!\"\n\nShe looked at him in a daze.\n\n\"We can cross on the ferry at half-past ten,\" he went on. \"You see that\nhouse--the white one?\"  He pointed to the other bank of the river where\na white cottage shrank among the trees not far from a little church.\n\"Mr. Barker lives there--you must have heard of him.  He's married\nscores and hundreds of couples from this side.  And we can be back here\nat half-past eleven--twelve at the latest.\"\n\nShe shook her head expressed, not determination, only doubt.\n\n\"I can't, Jack,\" she said.  \"They----\"\n\n\"Then you aren't certain you're ever going to marry me,\" he interrupted\nbitterly.  \"You don't mean what you promised me. You care more for them\nthan you do for me.  You don't really care for me at all.\"\n\n\"You don't believe that,\" she protested, her eyes and her mind on the\nlittle white cottage. \"You couldn't--you know me too well.\"\n\n\"Then there's no reason why we shouldn't get married.  Don't we belong\nto each other now?  Why should we refuse to stand up and say so?\"\n\nThat seemed unanswerable--a perfect excuse for doing what she wished to\ndo.  For the little white cottage fascinated her--how she did long to\nbe sure of him!  And she felt so free, so absolutely her own mistress\nin these new surroundings, where no one attempted to exercise authority\nover another.\n\n\"I must feel sure of you, Pauline.  Sometimes everything seems to be\nagainst me, and I even doubt you.  And--that's when the temptations\npull hardest.  If we were married it'd all be different.\"\n\nYes, it would be different.  And he would be securely hers, with her\nmind at rest instead of harassed as it would be if she let him go so\nfar away, free.  And where was the harm in merely repeating before a\npreacher the promise that now bound them both? She looked at him and he\nat her.\n\n\"You don't put any others before me, do you, dear?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, Jack--no one.  I belong to you.\"\n\n\"Come!\" he pleaded, and they went down to the boat.  She seemed to\nherself to be in a dream--in a trance.\n\nAs she walked beside him along the country road on the other shore a\nvoice was ringing in her ears:  \"Don't!  Don't!  Ask Olivia's advice\nfirst!\"  But she walked on, her will suspended, substituted for it his\nwill and her jealousy and her fears of his yielding to the urgings of\nhis father and the blandishments of \"that Cleveland girl.\"  He said\nlittle but kept close to her, watching her narrowly, touching her\ntenderly now and then.\n\nThe Reverend Josiah Barker was waiting for them--an oily smirk on a\nface smooth save where a thin fringe of white whiskers dangled from his\njaw-bone, ear to ear; fat, damp hands rubbing in anticipation of the\nlarge fee that was to repay him for celebrating the marriage and for\nkeeping quiet about it afterward.  At the proper place in the brief\nceremony Dumont, with a sly smile at Pauline which she faintly\nreturned, produced the ring--he had bought it at Saint X a week before\nand so had started a rumor that he and Caroline Sylvester were to be\nmarried in haste.  He held Pauline's hand firmly as he put the ring on\nher finger--he was significantly cool and calm for his age and for the\ncircumstances.  She was trembling violently, was pale and wan.  The\nring burned into her flesh.\n\n\"Whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder,\" ended Barker,\nwith pompous solemnity.\n\nDumont kissed her--her cheek was cold and at the touch of his lips she\nshuddered.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" he said in a low voice that was perfectly steady.\n\nThey went out and along the sunny road in silence.  \"Whom God hath\njoined,\" the voice was now dinning into her ears.  And she was saying\nto herself, \"Has GOD joined us?  If so, why do I feel as if I had\ncommitted a crime?\"  She looked guiltily at him--she felt no thrill of\npride or love at the thought that he was her husband, she his wife.\nAnd into her mind poured all her father's condemnations of him, with a\nvague menacing fear riding the crest of the flood.\n\n\"You're sorry you've done it?\" he said sullenly.\n\nShe did not answer.\n\n\"Well, it's done,\" he went on, \"and it can't be undone.  And I've got\nyou, Polly, in spite of them.  They might have known better than to try\nto keep me from getting what I wanted.  I always did, and I always\nshall!\"\n\nShe looked at him startled, then hastily looked away.  Even more than\nhis words and his tone, she disliked his eyes--gloating, triumphant.\nBut not until she was years more experienced did she study that\nnever-forgotten expression, study it as a whole--words, tone, look.\nThen, and not until then, did she know that she had instinctively\nshrunk because he had laid bare his base and all but loveless motive in\nmarrying her.\n\n\"And,\" he added, \"I'll force father to give me a big interest in the\nbusiness very soon.  Then--we'll announce it.\"\n\nAnnounce IT?  Announce WHAT?  \"Why, I'm a married woman,\" she thought,\nand she stumbled and almost fell.  The way danced before her eyes, all\nspotted with black.  She was just able to walk aboard the boat and drop\ninto a seat.\n\nHe sat beside her, took her hand and bent over it; as he kissed it a\ntear fell on it.  He looked at her and she saw that his eyes were\nswimming.  A sob surged into her throat, but she choked it back.\n\"Jack!\" she murmured, and hid her face in her handkerchief.\n\nWhen they looked each at the other both smiled--her foreboding had\nretreated to the background.  She began to turn the ring round and\nround upon her finger.\n\n\"Mrs. John Dumont,\" she said.  \"Doesn't it sound queer?\"  And she gazed\ndreamily away toward the ranges of hills between which the river danced\nand sparkled as it journeyed westward.  When she again became conscious\nof her immediate surroundings--other than Dumont--she saw a deck-hand\nlooking at her with a friendly grin.\n\nInstantly she covered the ring with her hand and handkerchief. \"But I\nmustn't wear it,\" she said to Dumont.\n\n\"No--not on your finger.\"  He laughed and drew from his pocket a\nslender gold chain.  \"But you might wear it on this, round your neck.\nIt'll help to remind you that you don't belong to yourself any more,\nbut to me.\"\n\nShe took the chain--she was coloring in a most becoming way--and hid it\nand the ring in her bosom.  Then she drew off a narrow hoop of gold\nwith a small setting and pushed it on his big little finger.\n\n\"And THAT, sir,\" she said, with a bewitching look, \"may help you not to\nforget that YOU belong to me.\"\n\nShe left the ferry in advance of him and faced Olivia just in time for\nthem to go down together to the half-past twelve o'clock dinner.\n\n\n\nV.\n\nFOUR FRIENDS.\n\nAs Mrs. Trent's was the best board in Battle Field there were more\napplicants than she could make places for at her one table. In the\nsecond week of the term she put a small table in the alcove of the\ndining-room and gave it to her \"star\" boarders--Pierson, Olivia and\nPauline.  They invited Scarborough to take the fourth place.  Not only\ndid Pierson sit opposite Olivia and Scarborough opposite Pauline three\ntimes a day in circumstances which make for intimacy, but also Olivia\nand Pierson studied together in his sitting-room and Pauline and\nScarborough in her sitting-room for several hours three or four times a\nweek.  Olivia and Pierson were sophomores.  Pauline and Scarborough\nwere freshmen; also, they happened to have the same three \"senior prep\"\nconditions to \"work off\"--Latin, zoology and mathematics.\n\nSuch intimacies as these were the matter-of-course at Battle Field.\nThey were usually brief and strenuous.  A young man and a young woman\nwould be seen together constantly, would fall in love, would come to\nknow each the other thoroughly.  Then, with the mind and character and\nlooks and moods of each fully revealed to the other, they would drift\nor fly in opposite directions, wholly disillusioned.  Occasionally they\nfound that they were really congenial, and either love remained or a\ncordial friendship sprang up.  The modes of thought, inconceivable to\nEuropeans or Europeanized Americans, made catastrophe all but\nimpossible.\n\nIt was through the girls that Scarborough got his invitation to the\nalcove table.  There he came to know Pierson and to like him. One\nevening he went into Pierson's rooms--the suite under Olivia and\nPauline's.  He had never seen--but had dreamed of--such a luxurious\nbachelor interior.  Pierson's father had insisted that his son must go\nto the college where forty years before he had split wood and lighted\nfires and swept corridors to earn two years of higher education.\nPierson's mother, defeated in her wish that her son should go East to\ncollege, had tried to mitigate the rigors of Battle Field's primitive\nsimplicity by herself fitting up his quarters.  And she made them the\nshow-rooms of the college.\n\n\"Now let's see what can be done for you,\" said Pierson, with the\nsuperiority of a whole year's experience where Scarborough was a\nbeginner.  \"I'll put you in the Sigma Alpha fraternity for one thing.\nIt's the best here.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about fraternities,\" Scarborough said. \"What are\nthey for?\"\n\n\"Oh, everybody that is anybody belongs to a fraternity.  There are\nabout a dozen of them here, and among them they get all the men with\nany claim to recognition.  Just now, we lean rather toward taking in\nthe fellows who've been well brought up.\"\n\n\"Does everybody belong to a fraternity?\"\n\n\"Lord, no!  Two-thirds don't belong.  The fellows outside are called\n'barbs'--that is, barbarians; we on the inside are Greeks. Though, I\nmust say, very few of us are Athenians and most of us are the rankest\nMacedonians.  But the worst Greeks are better than the best barbs.\nThey're the rummest lot of scrubs you ever saw--stupid drudges who live\nround in all sorts of holes and don't amount to anything.  The brush of\nthe backwoods.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--mm--I see.\"  Scarborough was looking uncomfortable.\n\n\"The Sigma Alphas'll take you in next Saturday,\" said Pierson. \"They do\nas I say, between ourselves.\"\n\n\"I'm ever so much obliged, but----\" Scarborough was red and began to\nstammer.  \"You see--I--it----\"\n\n\"What's the matter?  Expense?  Don't let that bother you.  The cost's\nnothing at all, and the membership is absolutely necessary to your\nposition.\"\n\n\"Yes--a matter of expense.\"  Scarborough was in control of himself now.\n\"But not precisely the kind of expense you mean. No--I can't join I'd\nrather not explain.  I'm ever so much obliged, but really I can't.\"\n\n\"As you please.\"  Pierson was offended.  \"But I warn you, you've got to\nbelong to one or the other of these fraternities or you'll be cut off\nfrom everything.  And you oughtn't to miss the chance to join the best.\"\n\n\"I see I've offended you.\"  Scarborough spoke regretfully. \"Please\ndon't think I'm not appreciating your kindness. But--I've made a sort\nof agreement with myself never to join anything that isn't organized\nfor a general purpose and that won't admit anybody who has that\npurpose, too.\"\n\nPierson thought on this for a moment.  \"Pardon me for saying so, but\nthat's nonsense.  You can't afford to stand alone.  It'll make\neverything harder for you--many things impossible.  You've got to yield\nto the prejudices of people in these matters.  Why, even the barbs have\nno use for each other and look up to us. When we have an election in\nthe Literary Society I can control more barb votes than any one else in\ncollege.  And the reason is--well, you can imagine.\"  (Mr. Pierson was\nonly twenty years old when he made that speech.)\n\n\"It doesn't disturb me to think of myself as alone.\"  The strong lines\nin Scarborough's face were in evidence.  \"But it would disturb me if I\nwere propped up and weren't sure I could stand alone.  I'm afraid to\nlean on any one or anything--my prop might give way.  And I don't want\nany friends or any associates who value me for any other reason than\nwhat I myself am.  I purpose never to 'belong' to anything or anybody.\"\n\nPierson laughed.  \"Do as you please,\" he said. \"I'd like to myself if\nit wasn't such an awful lot of trouble!\"\n\n\"Not in the end,\" replied Scarborough.\n\n\"Oh, bother the end.  To-day's good enough for me.\"\n\n\"You'd better not let Miss Shrewsbury hear you say that,\" said\nScarborough, his eyes mocking.\n\nPierson grew serious at once.  \"Splendid girl, isn't she?\"  She\nhappened to be the first he had known at all well who hadn't agreed\nwith him in everything he said, hadn't shown the greatest anxiety to\nplease him and hadn't practically thrown herself at his head.  His\ncombination of riches, good looks, an easy-going disposition and\ncleverness had so agitated those who had interested him theretofore\nthat they had overreached themselves. Besides, his mother had been\nsubtly watchful.\n\n\"Indeed, yes,\" assented Scarborough, heartily but not with\nenthusiasm--he always thought of Olivia as Pauline's cousin.\n\nThe four had arranged to go together to Indian Rock on the following\nSunday.  When the day came Olivia was not well; Pierson went to a poker\ngame at his fraternity house; Pauline and Scarborough walked alone.  As\nshe went through the woods beside him she was thinking so intensely\nthat she could not talk.  But he was not disturbed by her silence--was\nit not enough to be near her, alone with her, free to look at her, so\ngraceful and beautiful, so tasteful in dress, in every outward way what\nhe thought a woman ought to be?  Presently she roused herself and began\na remark that was obviously mere politeness.\n\nHe interrupted her.  \"Don't mind me.  Go on with your thinking--unless\nit's something you can say.\"\n\nShe gave him a quizzical, baffling smile.  \"How it would startle you if\nI did!\" she said.  \"But--I shan't.  And\"--she frowned\nimpatiently--\"there's no use in thinking about it.  It's all in the\nfuture.\"\n\n\"And one can't control the future.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed--one can,\" she protested.\n\n\"I wish you'd tell me how.  Are you sure you don't mean you could so\narrange matters that the future would control you? Anybody can\nSURRENDER to the future and give it hostages.  But that's not\ncontrolling, is it?\"\n\n\"Certainly it is--if you give the hostages in exchange for what you\nwant.\"  And she looked triumphant.\n\n\"But how do you know what you'll want in the future?  The most I can\nsay is that I know a few things I shan't want.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't like to be of that disposition,\" she said.\n\n\"But I'm afraid you are, whether you like it or not.\" Scarborough was\nhalf-serious, half in jest.\n\n\"Are you the same person you were a month ago?\"\n\nPauline glanced away.  \"What do you mean?\" she asked.\n\n\"I mean in thought--in feeling.\"\n\n\"Yes--and no,\" she replied presently, when she had recovered from the\nshock of his chance knock at the very door of her secret.  \"My coming\nhere has made a sort of revolution in me already.  I believe I've a\nmore--more grown-up way of looking at things.  And I've been getting\ninto the habit of thinking--and--and acting--for myself.\"\n\n\"That's a dangerous habit to form--in a hurry,\" said Scarborough.  \"One\noughtn't to try to swim a wide river just after he's had his first\nlesson in swimming.\"\n\nPauline, for no apparent reason, flushed crimson and gave him a nervous\nlook--it almost seemed a look of fright.\n\n\"But,\" he went on, \"we were talking of the change in you.  If you've\nchanged so much in, thirty days, or, say, in sixty-seven days--you've\nbeen here that long, I believe--think of your whole life.  The broader\nyour mind and your life become, the less certain you'll be what sort of\nperson to-morrow will find you. It seems to me--I know that, for\nmyself, I'm determined to keep the future clear.  I'll never tie myself\nto the past.\"\n\n\"But there are some things one MUST anchor fast to.\"  Pauline was\nlooking as if Scarborough were trying to turn her adrift in an open\nboat on a lonely sea.  \"There are--friends.  You wouldn't desert your\nfriends, would you?\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it if they insisted on deserting me.  I'd keep them if\ntheir way was mine.  If it wasn't--they'd give me up.\"\n\n\"But if you were--were--married?\"\n\nScarborough became intensely self-conscious.\n\n\"Well--I don't know--that is----\"  He paused, went on:  \"I shouldn't\nmarry until I was sure--her way and mine were the same.\"\n\n\"The right sort of woman makes her husband's way hers,\" said she.\n\n\"Does she?  I don't know much about women.  But it has always seemed to\nme that the kind of woman I'd admire would be one who had her own\nideals and ideas of life--and that--if--if she liked me, it would be\nbecause we suited each other.  You wouldn't want to be--like those\nprincesses that are brought up without any beliefs of any sort so that\nthey can accept the beliefs of the kingdom of the man they happen to\nmarry?\"\n\nPauline laughed.  \"I couldn't, even if I wished,\" she said.\n\n\"I should say not!\" he echoed, as if the idea in connection with such\nan indelibly distinct young woman were preposterous.\n\n\"But you have such a queer way of expressing yourself.  At first I\nthought you were talking of upsetting everything.\"\n\n\"I?  Mercy, no.  I've no idea of upsetting anything.  I'm only hoping I\ncan help straighten a few things that have been tumbled over or turned\nupside down.\"\n\nGradually, as they walked and talked, her own affairs--Dumont's and\nhers--retreated to the background and she gave Scarborough her whole\nattention.  Even in those days--he was then twenty-three--his\npersonality usually dominated whomever he was with.  It was not his\nsize or appearance of strength; it was not any compulsion of manner; it\nwas not even what he said or the way he said it.  All of these--and his\nvoice contributed; but the real secret of his power was that subtile\nmagnetic something which we try to fix--and fail--when we say \"charm.\"\n\nHe attracted Pauline chiefly because he had a way of noting the little\nthings--matters of dress, the flowers, colors in the sky or the\nlandscape, the uncommon, especially the amusing, details of\npersonality--and of connecting these trifles in unexpected ways with\nthe large aspects of things.  He saw the mystery of the universe in the\ncontour of a leaf; he saw the secret of a professor's character in the\nway he had built out his whiskers to hide an absolute lack of chin and\nto give the impression that a formidable chin was there.  He told her\nstories of life on his father's farm that made her laugh, other stories\nthat made her feel like crying.  And--he brought out the best there was\nin her. She was presently talking of the things about which she had\nalways been reticent--the real thoughts of her mind, those she had\nsuppressed because she had had no sympathetic listener, those she\nlooked forward to talking over with Dumont in that happy time when they\nwould be together and would renew the intimacy interrupted since their\nHigh School days.\n\nWhen she burst in upon Olivia her eyes were sparkling and her cheeks\nglowing.  \"The air was glorious,\" she said, \"and Mr. Scarborough; is SO\ninteresting.\"\n\nAnd Olivia said to herself:  \"In spite of his tight clothes he may cure\nher of that worthless Dumont.\"\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\"LIKE HIS FATHER.\"\n\nScarborough soon lifted himself high above the throng, and was marked\nby faculty and students as a man worth watching.  The manner of this\nachievement was one of those forecasts of the future with which youth\nbristles for those who take the trouble to watch it.\n\nAlthough Pierson was only a sophomore he was the political as well as\nthe social leader of his fraternity.  Envy said that the Sigma Alphas\ntruckled to his wealth; perhaps the exacter truth was that his wealth\nforced an earlier recognition of his real capacity.  His position as\nleader made him manager of the Sigma Alpha combination of fraternities\nand barbs which for six years had dominated the Washington and\nJefferson Literary Society.  The barbs had always voted humbly with the\naristocratic Sigma Alphas; so Pierson's political leadership apparently\nhad no onerous duties attached to it--and he was not the man to make\nwork for himself.\n\nAs the annual election approached he heard rumors of barb disaffection,\nof threatened barb revolt.  Vance, his barb lieutenant, reassured him.\n\n\"Always a few kickers,\" said Vance, \"and they make a lot of noise.  But\nthey won't draw off twenty votes.\"  Pierson made himself easy--there\nwas no danger of one of those hard-fought contests which in past years\nhad developed at Battle Field many of Indiana's adroit political\nleaders.\n\nOn election night he felt important and powerful as he sat in the front\nrow among the arrogant Sigma Alphas, at the head of his forces massed\nin the left side of the hall.  He had insisted on Scarborough's\noccupying a seat just behind him.  He tilted back in his arm-chair and\nsaid, in an undertone:  \"You're voting with us?\"\n\nScarborough shook his head.  \"Can't do it.  I'm pledged to Adee.\"\n\nPierson looked amused.  \"Who's he?  And who's putting him up?\"\n\n\"I'm nominating him,\" replied Scarborough, \"as the barb candidate.\"\n\n\"Take my advice don't do it, old man,\" said Pierson in a friendly,\nsomewhat patronizing tone.\n\n\"You'll only get our fellows down on you--them and all the fraternity\nmen.  And--well, your candidate'll have a dozen votes or so, at\nmost--and there'll be a laugh.\"\n\n\"Yes--I suppose there will be a laugh,\" said Scarborough, his eyes\ntwinkling.\n\n\"Don't do it,\" urged Pierson.  \"Be practical.\"\n\n\"No--I leave that to your people.\"\n\nJust then nominations for president were called for and the candidates\nof the two factions were proposed and seconded.  \"The nominations for\npresident are----\" began the chairman, but before he could utter the\nword \"closed\" Scarborough was on his feet--was saying, \"Mr. Chairman!\"\n\nPierson dropped his eyes and grew red with embarrassment for his friend\nwho was thus \"rushing on to make a fool of himself.\"\n\nScarborough's glance traveled slowly from row to row of expectant young\nmen.\n\n\"Mr. Chairman and fellow-members of the Washington and Jefferson\nSociety,\" he said in a conversational tone.  \"I have the honor of\nplacing in nomination Frank Adee, of Terre Haute.  In addition to other\nqualifications of which it would be superfluous for me to speak in this\npresence, he represents the masses of the membership of this society\nwhich has been too long dominated by and for its classes.  It is time\nto compel the fraternities to take faction and caste and political\nwire-pulling away from this hall, and to keep them away.  It is time to\nrededicate our society to equality, to freedom of thought and speech,\nto the democratic ideas of the plain yet proud builders of this college\nof ours.\"\n\nScarborough made no attempt at oratory, made not a single gesture.  It\nwas as though he were talking privately and earnestly with each one\nthere.  He sat amid silence; when a few barbs nervously applauded, the\nfraternity men of both factions, recovering themselves, raised a\nsuccession of ironical cheers.  A shabby, frightened barb stood\nawkwardly, and in a trembling, weak voice seconded the nomination.\nThere was an outburst of barb applause--strong, defiant.  Pierson was\nanxiously studying the faces of his barbs.\n\n\"By Jove,\" he muttered, \"Vance has been caught napping.  I believe\nScarborough has put up a job on us.  If I can't gain time we're beat.\"\nAnd he sprang to his feet, his face white.  In a voice which he\nstruggled in vain to keep to his wonted affected indifferent drawl, he\nsaid:  \"Mr. Chairman, I move you, sir, that we adjourn.\"  As he was\nbending to sit his ready lieutenant seconded the motion.\n\n\"Mr. Chairman!\"  It was an excited voice from the rear of the hall--the\nvoice of a tall, lank, sallow man of perhaps thirty-five.  \"What\nright,\" he shouted shrilly, \"has this Mr. Pierson to come here and make\nthat there motion?  He ain't never seen here except on election nights.\nHe----\"\n\nThe chairman rapped sharply.\n\n\"Motion to adjourn not debatable,\" he said, and then mumbled rapidly:\n\"The question's the motion to adjourn.  All in favor say Aye--all\nopposed, No--the ayes seem to have it--the ayes have----\"\n\n\"Mr. Chairman; I call for a count of the ayes and noes!\"  It was\nScarborough, standing, completely self-possessed.  His voice was not\nraised but it vibrated through that room, vibrated through those three\nhundred intensely excited young men.\n\nThe chairman--Waller, a Zeta Rho, of the Sigma Alpha combination--knew\nthat Pierson was scowling a command to him to override the rules and\nadjourn the meeting; but he could not take his eyes from Scarborough's,\ndared not disobey Scarborough's imperious look.  \"A count of the  ayes\nand noes is called for,\" he said.  \"The secretary will call the roll.\"\n\nPierson's motion was lost--one hundred and thirty-two to one hundred\nand seventy-nine.  For the first time in his life he was beaten; and it\nwas an overwhelming, a public defeat that made his leadership\nridiculous.  His vanity was cut savagely; it was impossible for him to\ncontrol himself to stay and witness the inevitable rout.  He lounged\ndown the wide aisle, his face masked in a supercilious smile, his\nglance contemptuously upon the jubilant barbs.  They were thick about\nthe doors, and as he passed among them he said, addressing no one in\nparticular:  \"A revolt of the Helots.\"  A barb raised a threatening\nfist; Pierson sneered, and the fist unclenched and dropped before his\nfearless eyes.\n\nAn hour later Scarborough, his ticket elected and the society\nadjourned, reached Mrs. Trent's porch.  In its darkness he saw the\nglowing end of a cigarette.  \"That you, Pierson?\" he asked in the tone\nof one who knows what the answer will be.\n\n\"Sit down for a few minutes,\" came the reply, in a strained voice.\n\nHe could not see even the outline of Pierson's face, but with those\nacute sensibilities which made life alternately a keen pleasure and a\npain to him, he felt that his friend was struggling for self-control.\nHe waited in silence.\n\nAt last Pierson began:  \"I owe you an apology. I've been thinking all\nsorts of things about you. I know they're unjust and--mean, which is\nworse.  But, damn it, Scarborough, I HATE being beaten.  And it doesn't\nmake defeat any the easier because YOU did it.\"\n\nHe paused; but Scarborough did not speak.\n\n\"I'm going to be frank,\" Pierson went on with an effort.  \"I know you\nhad a perfect right to do as you pleased, but--hang it all, old\nman--you might have warned me.\"\n\n\"But I didn't do as I pleased,\" said Scarborough.  \"And as for telling\nyou--\"  He paused before he interrupted himself with: \"But first I want\nto say that I don't like to give an account of myself to my friends.\nWhat does friendship mean if it forbids freedom?  I didn't approve or\ncondemn you because you belonged to a fraternity, and because you\nheaded a clique that was destroying the Literary Society by making it a\nplace for petty fraternity politics instead of a place to develop\nspeakers, writers and debaters.  Yet now you're bringing me to account\nbecause I didn't slavishly accept your ideas as my own.  Do you think\nthat's a sound basis for a friendship, Pierson?\"\n\nWhen Scarborough began Pierson was full of a grievance which he thought\nreal and deep.  He was proposing to forgive Scarborough, forgive him\ngenerously, but not without making him realize that it was an act of\ngenerosity.  As Scarborough talked he was first irritated, then, and\nsuddenly, convinced that he was himself in the wrong--in the wrong\nthroughout.\n\n\"Don't say another word, Scarborough,\" he replied, impulsively laying\nhis hand on the arm of his friend--how powerful it felt through the\nsleeve!  \"I've been spoiled by always having my own way and by people\nletting me rule them.  You gave me my first lesson in defeat.  And--I\nneeded it badly.  As for your not telling me, you'd have ruined your\nscheme if you had.  Besides, looking back, I see that you did warn me.\nI know now what you meant by always jumping on the fraternities and the\ncombinations.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Scarborough, simply.  \"When I saw you leaving the\nsociety hall I feared I'd lost a friend.  Instead, I've found what a\nfriend  I have.\"  Then after a brief silence he continued:  \"This\nlittle incident up there to-night--this little revolution I took part\nin--has meant a good deal to me. It was the first chance I'd had to\ncarry out the ideas I've thought over and thought over down there on\nthe farm while I was working in the fields or lying in the hay, staring\nup at the sky. And I don't suppose in all the future I'll ever have a\ngreater temptation to be false to myself than I had in the dread that's\nbeen haunting me--the dread of losing your friendship--and the\nfriendship of--of--some others who might see it as I was afraid you\nwould.  There may be lessons in this incident for you, Fred. But the\ngreatest lesson of all is the one you've taught me--NEVER to be afraid\nto go forward when the Finger points.\"\n\nPierson and Olivia walked to chapel together the next morning, and he\ntold her the story of the defeat, putting himself in a worse light than\nhe deserved.  But Olivia, who never lost a chance to attack him for his\nshortcomings, now, to his amazement, burst out against Scarborough.\n\n\"It was contemptible,\" she said hotly.  \"It was treachery!  It was a\npiece of cold-blooded ambition.  He'd sacrifice anything, any one, to\nambition.  I shall never like him again.\"\n\nPierson was puzzled--being in love with her, he had been deceived by\nher pretense that she had a poor opinion of him; and he did not\nappreciate that her sense of justice was now clouded by resentment for\nhis sake.  At dinner, when the four were together, she attacked\nScarborough.  Though she did not confess it, he forced her to see that\nat least his motives were not those she had been attributing to him.\nWhen he and Pauline were alone--Olivia and Pierson had to hurry away to\na lecture he said: \"What do YOU think, Miss Gardiner?  You--did you--do\nyou--agree with your cousin?\n\n\"I?\" Pauline dropped her eyes.  \"Oh, I----\"\n\nShe hesitated so long that he said:  \"Go on--tell me just what you\nthink.  I'd rather know than suspect.\"\n\n\"I think you did right.  But--I don't see how you had the courage to do\nit.\"\n\n\"That is, you think I did right--but the sort of right that's worse\nthan wrong.\"\n\n\"No--no!\" she protested, putting a good deal of feeling into her voice\nin the effort to reassure him.  \"I'd have been ashamed of you if you\nhadn't done it.  And--oh, I despise weakness in a man most of all!  And\nI like to think that if everybody in college had denounced you, you'd\nhave gone straight on.  And--you WOULD!\"\n\nWithin a week after this they were calling each the other by their\nfirst names.\n\n\nFor the Christmas holidays she went with her mother from Battle Field\ndirect to Chicago, to her father's sisters Mrs. Hayden--Colonel\nGardiner had been called south on business.  When she came back she and\nScarborough took up their friendship where they had left it.  They read\nthe same books, had similar tastes, disagreed sympathetically, agreed\nwith enthusiasm.  She saw a great deal of several other men in her\nclass, enough not to make her preference for him significant to the\ncollege--or to herself. They went for moonlight straw-rides, on\nmoonlight and starlight skating and ice-boat parties, for long walks\nover the hills--all invariably with others, but they were often\npractically alone. He rapidly dropped his rural manners and\nmannerisms--Fred Pierson's tailor in Indianapolis made the most radical\nof the surface changes in him.\n\nLate in February his cousin, the superintendent of the farm,\ntelegraphed him to come home.  He found his mother ill--plainly dying.\nAnd his father--Bladen Scarborough's boast had been that he never took\na \"dose of drugs\" in his life, and for at least seventy of his\nseventy-nine years he had been \"on the jump\" daily from long before\ndawn until long after sundown.  Now he was content to sit in his\narm-chair and, with no more vigorous protest than a frown and a growl,\nto swallow the despised drugs.\n\nEach day he made them carry him in his great chair into HER bedroom.\nAnd there he sat all day long, his shaggy brows down, his gaze rarely\nwandering from the little ridge her small body made in the high white\nbed; and in his stern eyes there was a look of stoic anguish.  Each\nnight, as they were carrying him to his own room, they took him near\nthe bed; and he leaned forward, and the voice that in all their years\nhad never been anything but gentle for her said:  \"Good night, Sallie.\"\nAnd the small form would move slightly, there would be a feeble turning\nof the head, a wan smile on the little old face, a soft \"Good night,\nBladen.\"\n\nIt was on Hampden's ninth day at home that the old man said \"Good\nnight, Sallie,\" and there was no answer--not even a stir. They did not\noffer to carry him in the next morning; nor did he turn his face from\nthe wall.  She died that day; he three days later--he had refused food\nand medicine; he had not shed a tear or made a sound.\n\nThus the journey side by side for fifty-one years was a journey no\nlonger.  They were asleep side by side on the hillside for ever.\n\nHampden stayed at home only one day after the funeral.  He came back to\nBattle Field apparently unchanged.  He was not in black, for Bladen\nScarborough abhorred mourning as he abhorred all outward symbols of the\nthings of the heart.  But after a week he told Pauline about it; and as\nhe talked she sobbed, though his voice did not break nor his eyes dim.\n\n\"He's like his father,\" she thought.\n\n\nWhen Olivia believed that Dumont was safely forgotten she teased\nher--\"Your adoring and adored Scarborough.\"\n\nPauline was amused by this.  With his unfailing instinct, Scarborough\nhad felt--and had never permitted himself to forget--that there was\nsome sort of wall round her for him.  It was in perfect good faith that\nshe answered Olivia:  \"You don't understand him.  He's a queer\nman--sometimes I wonder myself that he doesn't get just a little\nsentimental.  I suppose I'd find him exasperating--if I weren't\notherwise engaged.\"\n\nOlivia tried not to show irritation at this reference to Dumont. \"I\nthink you're mistaken about which of you is queer,\" she said.  \"You are\nthe one--not he.\"\n\n\"I?\"  Pauline laughed--she was thinking of her charm against any love\nbut one man's, the wedding ring she always wore at her neck.  \"Why, I\nCOULDN'T fall in love with HIM.\"\n\n\"The woman who gets him will do mighty well for herself--in every way,\"\nsaid Olivia.\n\n\"Indeed she will.  But--I'd as soon think of falling in love with a\ntree or a mountain.\"\n\nShe liked her phrase; it seemed to her exactly to define her feeling\nfor Scarborough.  She liked it so well that she repeated it to herself\nreassuringly many times in the next few weeks.\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nPAULINE AWAKENS.\n\nIn the last week of March came a succession of warm rains.  The leaves\nburst from their impatient hiding just within the cracks in the gray\nbark.  And on Monday the unclouded sun was irradiating a pale green\nworld from a pale blue sky.  The four windows of Pauline and Olivia's\nsitting-room were up; a warm, scented wind was blowing this way and\nthat the strays of Pauline's red-brown hair as she sat at the table,\nher eyes on a book, her thoughts on a letter--Dumont's first letter on\nlanding in America.  A knock, and she frowned slightly.\n\n\"Come!\" she cried, her expression slowly veering toward welcome.\n\nThe door swung back and in came Scarborough.  Not the awkward youth of\nlast October, but still unable wholly to conceal how much at a\ndisadvantage he felt before the woman he particularly wished to please.\n\n\"Yes--I'm ten minutes early,\" he said, apology in his tone for his\ninstinct told him that he was interrupting, and he had too little\nvanity to see that the interruption was agreeable.  \"But I thought\nyou'd be only reading a novel.\"\n\nFor answer she held up the book which lay before her--a solemn volume\nin light brown calf.\n\n\"Analytical geometry,\" he said; \"and on the first day of the finest\nspring the world ever saw!\"  He was at the window, looking out\nlongingly--sunshine, and soft air washed clean by the rains; the\nnew-born leaves and buds; the pioneer birds and flowers.  \"Let's go for\na walk.  We can do the Vergil to-night.\"\n\n\"YOU--talking of neglecting WORK!\"  Her smile seemed to him to sparkle\nas much in the waves of her hair as in her even white teeth and\ngold-brown eyes.  \"So you're human, just like the rest of us.\"\n\n\"Human!\"  He glanced at her and instantly glanced away.\n\n\"Do leave that window,\" she begged.  \"We must get the Vergil now.  I'm\nreading an essay at the society to-night--they've fined me twice for\nneglecting it.  But if you stand there reminding me of what's going on\noutside I'll not be able to resist.\"\n\n\"How this would look from Indian Rock!\"\n\nShe flung open a Vergil text-book with a relentless shake of the head.\n\"I've got the place.  Book three, line two forty-five--\n\n\"'Una in praecelsa consedit rupe Celaeno----'\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter what that hideous old Harpy howled at the pious\nAeneas,\" he grumbled.  \"Let's  go out and watch the Great God Pan\ndedicate his brand-new temple.\"\n\n\"Do sit there!\"  She pointed a slim white forefinger at the chair at\nthe opposite side of the table--the side nearer him. \"I'll be generous\nand work the dictionary to-day.\"  And she opened a fat, black,\ndull-looking book beside the Vergil.\n\n\"Where's the Johnnie?\" he asked, reluctantly dropping into the chair.\n\nShe laid Dryden's translation of the Aeneid on his side of the table.\nThey always read the poetical version before they began to translate\nfor the class-room--Dryden was near enough to the original to give them\nits spirit, far enough to quiet their consciences.  \"Find the place\nyourself,\" said she.  \"I'm not going to do everything.\"\n\nHe opened the Dryden and languidly turned the pages.  \"'At length\nrebuff'd, they leave their mangled----'\" he began.\n\n\"No--two or three lines farther down,\" she interrupted.  \"That was in\nthe last lesson.\"\n\nHe pushed back the rebellious lock that insisted on falling down the\nmiddle of his forehead, plunged his elbows fiercely upon the table, put\nhis fists against his temples, and began again:\n\n     \"'High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate\n      And thus her dismal errand did relate--'\n\nHave you got the place in the Latin?\" he interrupted himself.\n\nFortunately he did not look up, for she was watching the waving boughs.\n\"Yes,\" she replied, hastily returning to the book. \"You do your part\nand I'll do mine.\"\n\nHe read a few lines in an absent-minded sing-song, then interrupted\nhimself once more:  \"Did you ever smell anything like that breeze?\"\n\n\"Never.  'Bellum etiam pro caede bovum'--go on--I'm listening--or\ntrying to.\"\n\nHe read:\n\n  \"'But know that ere your promised walls you build,\n  My curse shall severely be fulfilled.\n  Fierce famine is your lot--for this misdeed,\n  Reduced to grind the plates on which you feed.'\"\n\nHe glanced at her.  She was leaning on her elbow, obviously weaving\nday-dreams round those boughs as they trembled with the ecstasy of\nspring.\n\n\"You are happy to-day?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes--happier than I have been for a year.\"  She smiled mysteriously.\n\"I've had good news.\"  She turned abruptly, looked him in the eyes with\nthat frank, clear expression--his favorite among his memory-pictures of\nher had it.  \"There's one thing that worries me--it's never off my mind\nlonger than a few minutes.  And when I'm blue, as I usually am on rainy\ndays, it makes me--horribly uncomfortable.  I've often almost asked\nyour advice about it.\"\n\n\"If you'd be sorry afterward that you told me,\" said he, \"I hope you\nwon't.  But if I can help you, you know how glad I'd be.\"\n\n\"It's no use to tell Olivia,\" Pauline went on.  \"She's bitterly\nprejudiced.  But ever since the first month I knew you, I felt that I\ncould trust you, that you were a real friend.  And you're so fair in\njudging people and things.\"\n\nHis eyes twinkled.\n\n\"I'm afraid I'd tilt the scales--just a little--where you were\nconcerned.\"\n\n\"Oh, I want you to do that,\" she answered with a smile.  \"Last fall I\ndid something--well, it was foolish, though I wouldn't admit that to\nany one else.  I was carried away by an impulse. Not that I regret.  In\nthe only really important way, I wouldn't undo it if I could--I think.\"\nThose last two words came absently, as if she were debating the matter\nwith herself.\n\n\"If it's done and can't be undone,\" he said cheerfully, \"I don't see\nthat advice is needed.\"\n\n\"But--you don't understand.\"  She seemed to be casting about for words.\n\"As I said, it was last fall--here.  In Saint X there was a man--and he\nand I--we'd cared for each other ever since we were children.  And then\nhe went away to college.  He did several things father didn't like.\nYou know how older people are--they don't make allowances.  And though\nfather's the gentlest, best--at any rate, he turned against Jack, and--\"\n\nScarborough abruptly went to the window and stood with his back to her.\n\nAfter a pause Pauline said, in a rush, \"And he came here last fall and\nwe got married.\"\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\n\"It was DREADFUL, wasn't it?\" she said in the tone of one who has just\nmade a shocking discovery.\n\nScarborough did not answer.\n\n\"I never realized till this minute,\" she went on after a while. \"Not\nthat I'm sorry or that I don't--don't CARE--just as I always did.  But\nsomehow, telling it out loud to some one else has made me see it in a\ndifferent light.  It didn't seem like treachery to them--to father and\nmother--then.  It hasn't seemed like a--a marriage REALLY\nmarriage--until now.\"\n\nAnother long silence.  Then she burst out appealingly:  \"Oh, I don't\nsee how I'm ever going to tell them!\"\n\nScarborough came back to his chair and seated himself.  His face was\ncuriously white.  It was in an unnatural voice that he said: \"How old\nis he?\"\n\n\"Twenty-five,\" she replied, then instantly flared up, as if he had\nattacked Dumont:  \"But it wasn't his fault--not in the least.  I knew\nwhat I was doing--and I wanted to do it.  You mustn't get a false\nimpression of him, Hampden.  You'd admire and respect him.  You--any\none--would have done as he did in the same circumstances.\"  She blushed\nslightly.  \"You and he are ever so much alike--even in looks.  It was\nthat that made me tell you, that made me like you as I have--and trust\nyou.\"\n\nScarborough winced.  Presently he began:  \"Yet you regret----\"\n\n\"No--no!\" she protested--too vehemently.  \"I do NOT regret marrying\nhim.  That was certain to be sooner or later.  All I regret is that I\ndid something that seems underhanded.  Perhaps I'm really only sorry I\ndidn't tell them as soon as I'd done it.\"\n\nShe waited until she saw he was not going to speak. \"And now,\" she\nsaid, \"I don't know HOW to tell them.\"  Again she waited, but he did\nnot speak, continued to look steadily out into the sky.  \"What do you\nthink?\" she asked nervously.  \"But I can see without your saying.  Only\nI--wish you'd SAY it.\"\n\n\"No, I don't condemn you,\" he said slowly.  \"I know you.  YOU couldn't\npossibly do anything underhanded.  If you'd been where you'd have had\nto conceal it directly, face to face, from some one who had the right\nto know--you'd never have done it.\"  He rested his arms on the table\nand looked straight at her.  \"I feel I must tell you what I think.  And\nI feel, too, it wouldn't be fair and honest if I didn't let you see why\nyou might not want to take my advice.\"\n\nShe returned his gaze inquiringly.\n\n\"I love you,\" he went on calmly.  \"I've known it ever since I missed\nyou so at the Christmas holidays.  I love you for what you are, and for\nwhat you're as certain to be as--as a rosebud is certain to be a\nfull-blown rose.  I love you as my father loved my mother.  I shall\nlove you always.\"  His manner was calm, matter-of-fact; but there was\nin his musical, magical voice a certain quality which set her nerves\nand her blood suddenly to vibrating.  She felt as if she were\nstruggling in a great sea--the sea of his love for her--struggling to\nreach the safety of the shore.\n\n\"Oh--I WISH you hadn't told me!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Suppose I hadn't; suppose you had taken my advice?  No\"--he shook his\nhead slowly--\"I couldn't do that, Pauline--not even to win you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I said anything to you about it.\"\n\n\"You needn't be.  You haven't harmed yourself.  And maybe I can help\nyou.\"\n\n\"No--we won't talk of it,\" she said--she was pressing her hand on her\nbosom where she could feel her wedding ring.  \"It wouldn't be right,\nnow.  I don't wish your advice.\"\n\n\"But I must give it.  I'm years and years older than you--many, many\nyears more than the six between us.  And----\"\n\n\"I don't wish to hear.\"\n\n\"For his sake, for your own sake, Pauline, tell them!  And they'll\nsurely help you to wait till you're older before you do\nanything--irrevocable.\"\n\n\"But I care for him,\" she said--angrily, though it could not have been\nwhat he was saying so gently that angered her.  \"You forget that I care\nfor him.  It IS irrevocable now.  And I'm glad it is!\"\n\n\"You LIKE him.  You don't LOVE him.  And--he's not worthy of your love.\nI'm sure it isn't prejudice that makes me say it.  If he were, he'd\nhave waited----\"\n\nShe was on her feet, her eyes blazing.\n\n\"I asked for advice, not a lecture.  I DESPISE you!  Attacking the man\nI love and behind his back!  I wish to be alone.\"\n\nHe rose but met her look without flinching.\n\n\"You can send ME away,\" he said gently, \"but you can't send away my\nwords.  And if they're true you'll feel them when you get over your\nanger.  You'll do what you think right.  But--be SURE, Pauline.  Be\nSURE!\"  In his eyes there was a look--the secret altar with the\nnever-to-be-extinguished flame upon it.  \"Be SURE!, Pauline. Be SURE.\"\n\nHer anger fell; she sank, forlorn, into a chair.  For both, the day had\nshriveled and shadowed.  And as he turned and left the room the warmth\nand joy died from air and sky and earth; both of them felt the latent\nchill--it seemed not a reminiscence of winter past but the icy\nforeboding of winter closing in.\n\nWhen Olivia came back that evening from shopping in Indianapolis she\nfound her cousin packing.\n\n\"Is it something from home?\" she asked, alarmed.\n\nPauline did not look up as she answered:\n\n\"No--but I'm going home--to stay--going in the morning.  I've\ntelegraphed them.\"\n\n\"To stay!\"\n\n\"Yes--I was married to Jack--here--last fall.\"\n\n\"You--married!  To JOHN DUMONT--you, only  seventeen--oh, Pauline--\"\nAnd Olivia gave way to tears for the first time since she was a baby.\n\nScarborough was neither at supper nor at breakfast--Pauline left\nwithout seeing him again.\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nTHE DECISION.\n\nWhen the sign-board on a station platform said \"5.2 miles to St. X,\"\nPauline sank back in her chair in the parlor-car with blanched face.\nAnd almost immediately, so it seemed to her, Saint X came into\nview--home!  She fancied she could see the very house as she looked\ndown on the mass of green in which the town was embowered.  The train\nslid into the station, slowed down--there were people waiting on the\nplatform--her father!  He was glancing from window to window, trying to\ncatch a glimpse of her; and his expression of almost agonized eagerness\nmade her heartsick.  She had been away from him for nearly seven\nmonths--long enough to break the habit which makes it impossible for\nmembers of a family to know how they really look to each other.  How\ngray and thin his beard seemed!  What was the meaning of that gaunt\nlook about his shoulders?  What was the strange, terrifying shadow over\nhim?  \"Why, he's OLD!\"  The tears welled into her eyes--\"He's gliding\naway from me!\"  She  remembered what she had to tell him and her knees\nalmost refused to support her.\n\nHe was at the step as she sprang down.  She flew into his arms. He held\nher away from him and scanned her face with anxious eyes.\n\n\"Is my little girl ill?\" he asked.  \"The telegram made me uneasy.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" she said with a reassuring hug.  \"Where's mother?\"\n\n\n\"She--she's got a--a--surprise for you.  We must hurry--she'll be\nimpatient, though she's seen you since I have.\"\n\nAt the curbstone stood the familiar surrey, with Mordecai humped upon\nthe front seat.  \"I don't see how the colonel ever knowed you,\" said\nhe, as she shook hands with him.  \"I never seen the like for growin'.\"\n\n\"But YOU look just the same, Mordecai--you and the surrey and the\nhorses.  And how's Amanda?\"\n\n\"Poorly,\" replied Mordecai--his invariable answer to inquiries about\nhis wife.  She patterned after the old school, which held that for a\nwoman to confess to good health was for her to confess to lack of\nrefinement, if not of delicacy.\n\n\"You think I've changed, father?\" asked Pauline, when the horses were\nwhirling them home.  She was so busily greeting the familiar streets\nand houses and trees and faces that she hardly heard his reply.\n\n\"'I never seen the like for growin','\" he quoted, his eyes shining with\npride in her.  He was a reticent man by nature as well as by training;\nhe could not have SAID how beautiful, how wonderful he thought her, or\nhow intensely he loved her.  The most he could do to express himself to\nher was, a little shyly, to pat her hand--and to LOOK it into\nMordecai's back.\n\nShe was about to snuggle up to him as a wave of delight at being home\nagain swept over her; but her secret rushed from the background of her\nmind.  \"How could I have done it?  How can I tell them?\"  Then, the\nserene and beautiful kindness of her father's face reassured her.\n\nHer mother was waiting in the open front door as the surrey came up the\ndrive--still the same dear old-young mother, with the same sweet\ndignity and gentleness.\n\n\"Oh, mother, mother!\" exclaimed Pauline, leaping from the carriage into\nher arms.  And as they closed about her she felt that sorrow and evil\ncould not touch her; felt just as when she, a little girl, fleeing from\nsome frightful phantom of her own imagining, had rushed there for\nsafety.  She choked, she sobbed, she led her mother to the big sofa\nopposite the stairway; and, sitting there, they held each the other\ntightly, Pauline kissing her, smoothing her hair, she caressing Pauline\nand crying softly.\n\n\"We've got a surprise for you, Polly,\" said she, when they were calmer.\n\n\"I don't want anything but you and father,\" replied Pauline.\n\nHer father turned away--and so she did not see the shadow deepen in his\nface.  Her mother shook her head, mischief in her eyes that were young\nas a girl's--younger far than her daughter's at that moment.  \"Go into\nthe sitting-room and see,\" she said.\n\nPauline opened the sitting-room door.  John Dumont caught her in his\narms.  \"Polly!\" he exclaimed.  \"It's all right.  They've come round\nand--and--here I am!\"\n\nPauline pushed him away from her and sank to the floor in a faint.\n\nWhen she came to herself she was lying on the divan in the\nsitting-room.  Her mother was kneeling beside her, bathing her temples\nwith cold water; her father and her husband were standing, helplessly\nlooking at her.  \"Send him away,\" she murmured, closing her eyes.\n\nOnly her mother heard.  She motioned to the two men to leave the room.\nWhen the door closed Pauline sat up.\n\n\"He said it was all right,\" she began feverishly.  \"What did he mean,\nmother?\"  She was hoping she was to be spared the worst part of her\nordeal.\n\nBut her mother's reply dashed her hopes, made her settle back among the\ncushions and hide her face.  \"It IS all right, Polly. You're to have\nyour own way, and it's your father's way.  John has convinced him that\nhe really has changed.  We knew--that is, I suspected why you were\ncoming, and we thought we'd give you a surprise--give you what your\nheart was set on, before you had to ask for it.  I'm so sorry, dear,\nthat the shock was--\"\n\nPauline lay perfectly still, her face hidden.  After a pause: \"I don't\nfeel well enough to see him now.  I want this day with you and father.\nTo-morrow--to-morrow, we'll--to-day I want to be as I was when I\nwas--just you and father, and the house and the garden.\"\n\nHer mother left her for a moment and, when she came back, said: \"He's\ngone.\"\n\nPauline gave a quick sigh of relief.  Soon she rose.  \"I'm going for\nfather, and we'll walk in the garden and forget there's anybody else in\nthe world but just us three.\"\n\nAt half-past eight they had family prayers in the sitting-room; Pauline\nkneeling near her mother, her father kneeling beside his arm-chair and\nin a tremulous voice pouring out his gratitude to God for keeping them\nall \"safe from the snares and temptations of the world,\" for leading\nthem thus far on the journey.\n\n\"And, God, our Father, we pray Thee, have this daughter of ours, this\nhandmaiden of Thine, ever in Thy keeping.  And these things we ask in\nthe name of Thy Son--Amen.\"  The serene quiet, the beloved old room,\nthe evening scene familiar to her from her earliest childhood, her\nfather's reverent, earnest voice, halting and almost breaking after\nevery word of the petition for her; her mother's soft echo of his\n\"Amen\"--Pauline's eyes were swimming as she rose from her knees.\n\nHer mother went with her to her bedroom, hovered about her as she\nundressed, helped her now and then with fingers that trembled with\nhappiness, and, when she was in bed, put out the light and \"tucked her\nin\" and kissed her--as in the old days.  \"Good night--God bless my\nlittle daughter--my HAPPY little daughter.\"\n\nPauline waited until she knew that they were sleeping.  Then she put on\na dressing-gown and went to the open window--how many springtimes had\nshe sat there in the moonlight to watch, as now, the tulips and the\nhyacinths standing like fairies and bombarding the stars with the most\ndelicious perfumes.\n\nShe sat hour after hour, giving no outward sign of battle within. In\nevery lull came Scarborough's \"Be SURE, Pauline!\" to start the tumult\nafresh.  When the stars began to pale in the dawn she rose--she WAS\nsure.  Far from sure that she was doing the best for herself; but sure,\nsure without a doubt, that she was doing her duty to her parents.\n\n\"I must not punish THEM for MY sin,\" she said.\n\n\nLate the next morning she went to the farthest corner of the garden, to\nthe small summer-house where she had played with her dolls and her\ndishes, where she had worked with slate and spelling-book, where she\nhad read her favorite school-girl romances, where she had dreamed her\nown school-girl romance.  She was waiting under the friendly old canopy\nof bark--the posts supporting it were bark-clad, too; up and around and\nbetween them clambered the morning-glories in whose gorgeous,\nvelvet-soft trumpets the sun-jewels glittered.\n\nAnd presently he came down the path, his keen face and insolent eyes\ntriumphant.  He was too absorbed in his own emotion especially to note\nhers.  Besides, she had always been receptive rather than demonstrative\nwith him.\n\n\"We'll be married again, and do the gossips out of a sensation,\" he\nsaid.  Though she was not looking at him, his eyes shifted from her\nface as he added in a voice which at another time she might have\nthought strained:  \"Then, too, your father and mother and mine are so\nstrait-laced--it'd give 'em a terrible jar to find out.  You're a good\ndeal like them, Polly--only in a modern sort of way.\"\n\nPauline flushed scarlet and compressed her lips.  She said presently:\n\"You're sure you wish it?\"\n\n\"Wish what?\"\n\n\"To marry me.  Sometimes I've thought we're both too young, that we\nmight wait----\"\n\nHe put his arm round her with an air of proud possession. \"What'd be\nthe sense in that?\" he demanded gaily.  \"Aren't you MINE?\"\n\nAnd again she flushed and lowered her eyes and compressed her lips.\nThen she astonished him by flinging her arms round his neck and kissing\nhim hysterically.  \"But I DO love you!\" she exclaimed.  \"I do! I DO!\"\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nA THOROUGHBRED RUNS AWAY.\n\nIt was midday six weeks later, and Pauline and Dumont were landing at\nLiverpool, when Scarborough read in the college-news column of the\nBattle Field Banner that she had \"married the only son of Henry Dumont,\nof Saint Christopher, one of the richest men in our state, and has\ndeparted for an extended foreign tour.\" Olivia--and Pierson\nnaturally--had known, but neither had had the courage to tell him.\n\nScarborough was in Pierson's room.  He lowered the paper from in front\nof his face after a few minutes.\n\n\"I see Pauline has married and gone abroad,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, so I heard from Olivia,\" replied Pierson, avoiding Scarborough's\neyes.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" continued Scarborough, tranquil so far as\nPierson could judge.  \"I'd have liked to send her a note.\"\n\nPierson was silent.\n\n\"I thought it would cut him horribly,\" he was thinking.  \"And he's\ntaking it as if he had only a friendly interest.\" Scarborough's face\nwas again behind the newspaper.  When he had finished it he sauntered\ntoward the door.  He paused there to glance idly at the titles of the\ntop row in the book-case. Pierson was watching him.  \"No--it's all\nright,\" he concluded. Scarborough was too straight and calm just to\nhave received such a blow as that news would have been had HE cared for\nPauline. Pierson liked his look better than ever before--the tall,\npowerful figure; the fair hair growing above his wide and lofty brow,\nwith the one defiant lock; and in his aquiline nose and blue-gray eyes\nand almost perfect mouth and chin the stamp of one who would move\nforward irresistibly, moving others to his will.\n\n\"How old are you, Scarborough?\" he asked.\n\n\"Twenty-three-nearly twenty-four.  I ought to be ashamed to be only a\nfreshman, oughtn't I?\"  He shrugged his shoulders.  \"I'm tired of it\nall.\"  And he strolled out.\n\nHe avoided Pierson and Olivia and all his friends for several days,\nwent much into the woods alone, took long walks at night. Olivia would\nhave it that he had been hard hit, and almost convinced Pierson.\n\n\"He's the sort of person that suffers the most,\" she said. \"I've a\nbrother like him--won't have sympathy, keeps a wound covered up so that\nit can't heal.\"\n\n\"But what shall I do for him?\" asked Pierson.\n\n\"Don't do anything--he'd hate you if you did.\"\n\nAfter a week or ten days he called on Pierson and, seating himself at\nthe table, began to shuffle a pack of cards.  He looked tired.\n\n\"I never saw cards until I was fifteen,\" he said.\n\n\"At home they thought them one of the devil's worst devices--we had a\nreal devil in our house.\"\n\n\"So did we,\" said Pierson.\n\n\"But not a rip-snorter like ours--they don't have him in cities, or\neven in towns, any more.  I've seen ours lots of times after the lights\nwere out--saw him long after I'd convinced myself in daylight that he\ndidn't exist.  But I never saw him so close as the night of the day I\nlearned to play casino.\"\n\n\"Did you learn in the stable?\" asked Pierson.\n\n\"That's where I learned, and mother slipped up behind me--I didn't know\nwhat was coming till I saw the look in the other boy's face.  Then--\"\nPierson left the rest to imagination.\n\n\"I learned in the hay-loft--my sister and my cousin Ed and I. One of\nthe farm-hands taught us.  The cards were so stained we could hardly\nsee the faces.  That made them look the more devilish.  And a\nthunder-storm came up and the lightning struck a tree a few rods from\nthe barn.\"\n\n\"Horrible!\" exclaimed Pierson.  \"I'll bet you fell to praying.\"\n\n\"Not I.  I'd just finished Tom Paine's Age of Reason--a preacher's son\ndown the pike stole it from a locked closet in his father's library and\nloaned it to me.  But I'll admit the thunderbolt staggered me.  I said\nto them--pretty shakily, I guess:  'Come on, let's begin again.'  But\nthe farm-hand said: 'I reckon I'll get on the safe side,' and began to\npray--how he roared!  And I laughed--how wicked and reckless and brave\nthat laugh did sound to me.  'Bella and Ed didn't know which to be more\nafraid of--my ridicule or the lightning.  They compromised--they didn't\npray and they didn't play.\"\n\n\"And so you've never touched a card since.\"\n\n\"We played again the next afternoon--let's have a game of poker. I'm\nbored to death today.\"\n\nThis was Scarborough's first move toward the fast set of which Pierson\nwas leader.  It was a small fast set--there were not many spoiled sons\nat Battle Field.  But its pace was rapid; for every member of it had a\nconstitution that was a huge reservoir of animal spirits and western\nenergy.  They \"cribbed\" their way through recitations and\nexaminations--as the faculty did not put the students on honor but\nwatched them, they reasoned that cribbing was not dishonorable provided\none did barely enough of it to pull him through.  They drank a great\ndeal--usually whisky, which they disliked but poured down raw, because\nit was the \"manly\" drink and to take it undiluted was the \"manly\" way.\nThey made brief excursions to Indianapolis and Chicago for the sort of\ncarousals that appeal to the strong appetites and undiscriminating\ntastes of robust and curious youth.\n\nScarborough at once began to reap the reward of his advantages--a\nnaturally bold spirit, an unnaturally reckless mood.  In two weeks he\nwon three hundred dollars, half of it from Pierson.  He went to Chicago\nand in three nights' play increased this to twenty-nine hundred.  The\nnoise of the unprecedented achievement echoed through the college.  In\nits constellation of bad examples a new star had blazed out, a star of\nthe first magnitude.\n\nBladen Scarborough had used his surplus to improve and extend his\noriginal farm.  But farms were now practically unsalable, and Hampden\nand Arabella were glad to let their cousin Ed--Ed Warfield--stay on,\nrent free, because with him there they were certain that the place\nwould be well kept up.  Hampden, poor in cash, had intended to spend\nthe summer as a book agent.  Instead, he put by a thousand dollars of\nhis winnings to insure next year's expenses and visited Pierson at his\nfamily's cottage in the summer colony at Mackinac.  He won at poker\nthere and went on East, taking Pierson.  He lost all he had with him,\nall Pierson could lend him, telegraphed to Battle Field for half his\nthousand dollars, won back all he had lost and two thousand besides.\n\nWhen he reappeared at Battle Field in September he was dazzling to\nbehold.  His clothes were many and had been imported for him by the\nChicago agent of a London tailor.  His shirts and ties were in patterns\nand styles that startled Battle Field.  He had taken on manners and\npersonal habits befitting a \"man of the world\"--but he had not lost\nthat simplicity and directness which were as unchangeably a part of him\nas the outlines of his face or the force which forbade him to be idle\nfor a moment.  He and Pierson--Pierson was pupil, now--took a suite of\nrooms over a shop in the town and furnished them luxuriously.  They had\nbrought from New York to look after them and their belongings the first\nEnglish manservant Battle Field had seen.\n\nScarborough kept up his college work; he continued regularly to attend\nthe Literary Society and to be its most promising orator and debater;\nhe committed no overt act--others might break the college rules, might\nbe publicly intoxicated and noisy, but he was always master of himself\nand of the situation.  Some of the fanatical among the religious\nstudents believed and said that he had sold himself to the devil.  He\nwould have been expelled summarily but for Pierson--Pierson's father\nwas one of the two large contributors to the support of the college,\nand it was expected that he would will it a generous endowment.  To\nentrap Scarborough was to entrap Pierson.  To entrap Pierson--  The\nfaculty strove to hear and see as little as possible of their doings.\n\nIn the college Y.M.C.A. prayers were offered for Scarborough--his name\nwas not spoken, but every one understood.  A delegation of the\nreligious among his faithful fellow barbs called upon him to pray and\nto exhort.  They came away more charmed than ever with their champion,\nand convinced that he was the victim of slander and envy.  Not that he\nhad deliberately deceived them, for he hadn't; he was simply courteous\nand respectful of their sincerity.\n\n\"The fraternities are in this somewhere,\" the barbs decided. \"They're\ntrying to destroy him by lying about him.\"  And they liked it that\ntheir leader was the brilliant, the talked-about, the sought-after\nperson in the college.  When he stood up to speak in the assembly hall\nor the Literary Society they always greeted him with several rounds of\napplause.\n\nTo the chagrin of the faculty and the irritation of the fraternities a\njury of alumni selected him to represent Battle Field at the oratorical\ncontest among the colleges of the state. And he not only won there but\nalso at the interstate contest--a victory over the orators of the\ncolleges of seven western states in which public speaking was, and is,\nan essential part of higher education.  His oratory lacked style, they\nthought at Battle Field.  It was the same then, essentially, as it was\na few years later when the whole western country was discussing it.  He\nseemed to depend entirely upon the inherent carrying power of his ably\nconstructed sentences--like so many arrows, some flying gracefully,\nothers straight and swift, all reaching the mark at which they were\naimed.  In those days, as afterward, he stood upon the platform almost\nmotionless; his voice was clear and sweet, never noisy, but subtly\npenetrating and, when the sense demanded it, full of that mysterious\nquality which makes the blood run more swiftly and the nerves tingle.\n\"Merely a talker, not an orator,\" declared the professor of elocution,\nand few of those who saw him every day appreciated his genius then.  It\nwas on the subject-matter of his oration, not on his \"delivery,\" that\nthe judges decided for him--so they said and thought.\n\nIn February of this resplendent sophomore year there came in his mail a\nletter postmarked Battle Field and addressed in printed handwriting.\nThe envelope contained only a newspaper cutting--from the St.\nChristopher Republic:\n\n\nAt four o'clock yesterday afternoon a boy was born to Mr. and Mrs. John\nDumont.  It is their first child, the first grandchild of the Dumont\nand Gardiner families.  Mother and son are reported as doing well.\n\n\nScarborough spent little time in the futile effort to guess what coward\nenemy had sped this anonymous shaft on the chance of its hitting him.\nHis only enemies that interested him were those within himself.  He\ndestroyed envelope and clipping, then said to Pierson:  \"I neglected to\ncelebrate an important event not long ago.\"  He paused to laugh--so\nqueerly that Pierson looked at him uneasily.  \"We must go to Chicago to\ncelebrate it.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Fred.  \"We'll get Chalmers to go with us to-morrow.\"\n\n\"No-to-day--the four-o'clock train--we've got an hour and a half.  And\nwe'll have four clear days.\"\n\n\"But there's the ball to-night and I'm down for several dances.\"\n\n\"We'll dance them in Chicago.  I've never been really free to dance\nbefore.\"  He poured out a huge drink.  \"I'm impatient for the ball to\nbegin.\"  He lifted his glass.  \"To our ancestors,\" he said, \"who\nrepressed themselves, denied themselves, who hoarded health and\nstrength and capacity for joy, and transmitted them in great oceans to\nus--to drown our sorrows in!\"\n\nHe won six hundred dollars at faro in a club not far from the\nAuditorium, Pierson won two hundred at roulette, Chalmers lost\nseventy--they had about fourteen hundred dollars for their four days'\n\"dance.\"  When they took the train for Battle Field they had spent all\nthey had with them--had flung it away for dinners, for drives, for\ntheaters, for suppers, for champagne.  All the return journey\nScarborough stared moodily out of the car window. And at every movement\nthat disturbed his clothing there rose to nauseate him, to fill him\nwith self-loathing, the odors of strong, sickening-sweet perfumes.\n\nThe next day but one, as he was in the woods near Indian Rock, he saw\nOlivia coming toward him.  They had hardly spoken for several months.\nHe turned to avoid her but she came on after him.\n\n\"I wish to talk with you a few minutes, Mr. Scarborough,\" she said\ncoldly, storm in her brave eyes.\n\n\"At your service,\" he answered with strained courtesy.  And he walked\nbeside her.\n\n\"I happen to know,\" she began, \"that they're going to expel you and\nFred Pierson the next time you leave here without permission.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  You are very kind to warn me of my awful danger.\"  He looked\ndown at her with a quizzical smile.\n\n\"And I wish to say I think it's a disgrace that they didn't do it long\nago,\" she went on, her anger rising to the bait of his expression.\n\n\"Your opinions are always interesting,\" he replied.  \"If you have\nnothing further I'll ask your permission to relieve you of----\"\n\n\"No,\" she interrupted.  \"I've not said what I wished to say. You're\nmaking it hard for me.  I can't get accustomed to the change in you\nsince last year.  There used to be a good side to you, a side one could\nappeal to.  And I want to talk about--Fred. You're RUINING him.\"\n\n\"You flatter me.\"  He bowed mockingly.  \"But I doubt if HE'D feel\nflattered.\"\n\n\"I've told him the same thing, but you're too strong for me.\" Her voice\ntrembled; she steadied it with a frown.  \"I can't influence him any\nlonger.\"\n\n\"Really, Miss Shrewsbury----\"\n\n\"Please!\" she said.  \"Fred and I were engaged.  I broke it last night.\nI broke it because--you know why.\"\n\nScarborough flushed crimson.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said.  \"I didn't know he was engaged.\"\n\n\"I know you, Hampden Scarborough,\" Olivia continued.  \"I've understood\nwhy you've been degrading yourself.  And I haven't blamed you--though\nI've wondered at your lack of manhood.\"\n\n\"You are imposing on my courtesy,\" he said haughtily.\n\n\"I can't help it.  You and I must talk this thing to the end. You're\nrobbing me of the man I love.  Worse than that, you're destroying him,\ndragging him down to a level at which HE may stay, while YOU are sure\nto rise again.  You've got your living to make--I don't agree with\nthose who think you'll become a professional gambler.  But he his\nfather's rich and indulgent, and--God only knows how low he'll sink if\nyou keep on pushing him.\"\n\n\"You are excited, hysterical.  You misjudge him, believe me,\" said\nScarborough, gently.\n\n\"No--I know he's not depraved--yet.  Do you think _I_ could care for\nhim if he were?\"\n\n\"I hope so.  That's when he'd need it most.\"\n\nOlivia grew red.  \"Well, perhaps I should.  I'm a fool, like all women.\nBut I ask you to let him alone, to give his better self a chance.\"\n\n\"Why not ask him to let ME alone--to give MY better nature a chance?\"\n\n\"You--laughing at me in these circumstances!  You who pretended to be a\nman, pretended to love Pauline Gardiner----\"\n\nHe started and his eyes blazed, as if she had cut him across the face\nwith a whip.  Then he drew himself up with an expression of insolent\nfury.  His lips, his sharp white teeth, were cruel.\n\nShe bore his look without flinching.\n\n\"Yes,\" she went on, \"you think you love her.  Yet you act as if her\nlove were a degrading influence in your life, as if she were a bad\nwoman instead of one who ought to inspire a man to do and be his best.\nHow ashamed she'd be of you, of your love, if she could see you as you\nare now--the tempter of all the bad impulses in this college.\"\n\nHe could not trust himself to reply.  He was suffocating with rage and\nshame.  He lifted his hat, walked rapidly away from her and went home.\nPierson had never seen him in an ugly mood before.  And he, too, was in\nan ugly mood--disgusted with his own conduct, angry at Scarborough,\nwhom he held responsible for the unprecedented excesses of this last\ntrip to Chicago and for their consequences.\n\n\"What's happened?\" he asked sourly.  \"What's the matter with YOU?\"\n\n\"Your Olivia,\" replied Scarborough, with a vicious sneer, \"has been\ninsulting me for your sins.  She is a shrew!  I don't wonder you\ndropped her.\"\n\nPierson rose slowly and faced him.\n\n\"You astonish me,\" he said.  \"I shouldn't have believed you capable of\na speech which no gentleman could possibly utter.\"\n\n\"YOU, sitting as a court of honor to decide what's becoming a\ngentleman!\"  Scarborough looked amused contempt.  \"My dear Pierson,\nyou're worse than offensive--you are ridiculous.\"\n\n\"No man shall say such things to me especially a man who notoriously\nlives by his wits.\"\n\nScarborough caught him up as if he had been a child and pinned him\nagainst the wall.  \"Take that back,\" he said, \"or I'll kill you.\"  His\ntone was as colorless as his face.\n\n\"Kill and be damned,\" replied Pierson, cool and disdainful. \"You're a\ncoward.\"\n\nScarborough's fingers closed on Pierson's throat.  Then flashed into\nhis mind that warning which demands and gets a hearing in the wildest\ntempest of passion before an irrevocable act can be done.  It came to\nhim in the form of a reminder of his laughing remark to Pauline when he\ntold her of the traditions of murder in his family.  He released\nPierson and fled from the apartment.\n\nHalf an hour later Pierson was reading a note from him:\n\n\"I've invited some friends this evening.  I trust it will be convenient\nfor you to absent yourself.  They'll be out by eleven, and then, if you\nreturn, we can decide which is to stay in the apartment and which to\nleave.\"\n\nPierson went away to his fraternity house and at half-past eight\nScarborough, Chalmers, Jack Wilton and Brigham sat down to a game of\npoker.  They had played about an hour, the cards steadily against\nChalmers and Brigham--the cards were usually against Brigham.  He was a\nmere boy, with passionate aspirations to be considered a sport.  He had\nbeen going a rapid gait for a year. He had lost to Scarborough alone as\nmuch as he had expected to spend on the year's education.\n\nToward ten o'clock there was a jack-pot with forty-three dollars in it\nand Brigham was betting wildly, his hands and his voice trembling, his\nlips shriveled.  With a sudden gesture Chalmers caught the ends of the\ntable and jerked it back.  There--in Brigham's lap--were two cards.\n\n\"I thought so!\" exclaimed Chalmers.  \"You dirty little cheat! I've been\nwatching you.\"\n\nThe boy looked piteously at Chalmers' sneering face, at the faces of\nthe others.  The tears rolled down his cheeks.  \"For God's sake, boys,\"\nhe moaned, \"don't be hard on me.  I was desperate. I've lost\neverything, and my father can't give me any more.  He's a poor man, and\nhe and mother have been economizing and sacrificing to send me here.\nAnd when I saw I was ruined--God knows, I didn't think what I was\ndoing.\"  He buried his face in his hands.  \"Don't be hard on me,\" he\nsobbed.  \"Any one of you might have done the same if he was in my fix.\"\n\n\"You sniveling cur,\" said Chalmers, high and virtuous, \"how dare you\nsay such a thing!  You forget you're among gentlemen----\"\n\n\"None of that, Chalmers,\" interrupted Scarborough.  \"The boy's telling\nthe truth.  And nobody knows it better than YOU.\"  This with a\nsignificant look into Chalmers' eyes.  They shifted and he colored.\n\n\"I agree with Scarborough,\" said Wilton.  \"We oughtn't to have let the\nboy into our games.  We must never mention what has happened here this\nevening.\"\n\n\"But we can't allow a card sharp to masquerade as a gentleman,\"\nobjected Chalmers.  \"I confess, Scarborough, I don't understand how you\ncan be so easy-going in a matter of honor.\"\n\n\"You think I must have a fellow-feeling for dishonor, eh?\" Scarborough\nsmiled satirically.  \"I suppose because I was sympathetic enough with\nyou to overlook the fact that you were shy on your share of our Chicago\ntrip.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The three hundred you borrowed of Pierson when you thought he was too\nfar gone to know what he was doing.  My back was turned--but there was\nthe mirror.\"\n\nChalmers' sullen, red face confirmed Scarborough's charge.\n\n\"No,\" continued Scarborough, \"we GENTLEMEN ought to be charitable\ntoward one another's DISCOVERED lapses.\"  He seated himself at his desk\nand wrote rapidly:\n\n\nWe, the undersigned, exonerate Edwin Brigham of cheating in the poker\ngame in Hampden Scarborough's rooms on Saturday evening, February 20,\n18--.  And we pledge ourselves never to speak of the matter either to\neach other or to any one else.\n\n\n\"I've signed first,\" said Scarborough, rising and holding the pen\ntoward Chalmers.  \"Now, you fellows sign.  Chalmers!\"\n\nChalmers signed, and then Wilton.\n\n\"Take Chalmers away with you,\" said Scarborough to Wilton in an\nundertone.  \"I've something to say to Brigham.\"\n\nWhen they were gone he again seated himself at his desk and, taking his\ncheck-book, wrote a check and tore it out.\n\n\"Now, listen to me, Brig,\" he said friendlily to Brigham, who seemed to\nbe in a stupor.  \"I've won about six hundred dollars from you, first\nand last--more, rather than less.  Will that amount put you in the way\nof getting straight?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Brigham, dully.\n\n\"Then here's a check for it.  And here's the paper exonerating you.\nAnd--I guess you won't play again soon.\"\n\nThe boy choked back his sobs.\n\n\"I don't know how I ever came to do it, Scarborough.  Oh, I'm a dog, a\ndog!  When I started to come here my mother took me up to her bedroom\nand opened the drawer of her bureau and took out a savings-bank\nbook--it had a credit of twelve hundred dollars. 'Do you see that?' she\nsaid.  'When you were born I began to put by as soon as I was\nable--every cent I could from the butter and the eggs--to educate my\nboy.  And now it's all coming true,' she said, Scarborough, and we\ncried together.  And----\"  Brigham burst into a storm of tears and\nsobs.  \"Oh, how could I do it!\" he said.  \"How COULD I!\"\n\n\"You've done wrong,\" said Scarborough, shakily, \"but I've done much\nworse, Eddie.  And it's over now, and everything'll be all right.\"\n\n\"But I can't take your money, Scarborough.  I must pay for what I've\ndone.\"\n\n\"You mean, make your mother pay.  No, you must take it back, Brigham.\nI owe it to you--I owe it to your mother.  This, is the butter and egg\nmoney that I--I stole from her.\"\n\nHe put the papers into the boy's pocket.  \"You and I are going to be\nfriends,\" he went on.\n\n\"Come round and see me to-morrow--no, I'll look you up.\"  He put out\nhis hand and held Brigham's hand in a courage-giving grasp.  \"And--I\nhope I'll have the honor of meeting your mother some day.\"\n\nBrigham could only look his feelings.  Soon after he left Pierson came.\nHis anger had evaporated and his chief emotion was dread lest\nScarborough might still be angry.  \"I want to take back----\" he began\neagerly, as soon as his head was inside the door.\n\n\"I know you do, but you shan't,\" replied Scarborough.  \"What you said\nwas true, what Olivia said was true.  I've been acting like a\nblackguard.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pierson, \"what I said was a disgraceful lie.  Will you try\nto forget it, Scarborough?\"\n\n\"FORGET it?\" Scarborough looked at his friend with brilliant eyes.\n\"Never!  So help me God, never!  It's one of three things that have\noccurred to-day that I must never forget.\"\n\n\"Then we can go on as before.  You'll still be my friend?\"\n\n\"Not STILL, Fred, but for the first time.\"\n\nHe looked round the luxurious study with a laugh and a sigh. \"It'll be\na ghastly job, getting used to the sort of surroundings I can earn for\nmyself.  But I've got to grin and bear it.  We'll stay on here together\nto the end of the term--my share's paid, and besides, I'm not going to\ndo anything sensational.  Next year--we'll see.\"\n\nWhile Pierson was having his final cigarette before going to bed he\nlooked up from his book to see before him Scarborough, even more\ntremendous and handsome in his gaudy pajamas.\n\n\"I wish to register a solemn vow,\" said he, with mock solemnity that\ndid not hide the seriousness beneath.  \"Hear me, ye immortal gods!\nNever again, never again, will I engage in any game with a friend where\nthere is a stake.  I don't wish to tempt.  I don't wish to be tempted.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" said Pierson.  \"You're simply cutting yourself off\nfrom a lot of fun.\"\n\n\"I have spoken,\" said Scarborough, and he withdrew to his bedroom.\nWhen the door was closed and the light out he paused at the edge of the\nbed and said:  \"And never again, so long as he wishes to retain his\ntitle to the name man, will Hampden Scarborough take from anybody\nanything which he hasn't honestly earned.\"\n\nAnd when he was in bed he muttered:  \"I shall be alone, and I may stay\npoor and obscure, but I'll get back my self-respect--and keep\nit--Pauline!\"\n\n\n\nX.\n\nMRS. JOHN DUMONT.\n\nAnd Pauline?--She was now looking back upon the first year of her\nmarried life.\n\nShe had been so brought up that at seventeen, within a few weeks of\neighteen, she had only the vaguest notion of the meaning of the step\nshe was about to take in \"really marrying\" John Dumont.  Also, it had\nnever occurred to her as possible for a properly constituted woman not\nto love her husband.  It was clearly her duty to marry Jack; therefore,\nthe doubting thoughts and the ache at the heart which would not ease\nwere merely more outcroppings of the same evil part of her nature that\nhad tempted her into deceiving her parents, and into entangling herself\nand Scarborough.  She knew that, if she were absolutely free, she would\nnot marry Jack.  But she felt that she had bartered away her birthright\nof freedom; and now, being herself, the daughter of HER father and HER\nmother, she would honorably keep her bargain, would love where she\nought to love--at seventeen \"I will\" means \"I shall.\"  And so--they\nwere \"really married.\"\n\nBut the days passed, and there was no sign of the miracle she had\nconfidently expected.  The magic of the marriage vow failed to\ntransform her; Pauline Dumont was still Pauline Gardiner in mind and in\nheart.  There was, however, a miracle, undreamed of, mysterious,\noverwhelming--John Dumont, the lover, became John Dumont, the husband.\nBeside this transformation, the revelation that the world she loved and\nlived in did not exist for him, or his world for her, seemed of slight\nimportance.  She had not then experience enough to enable her to see\nthat transformation and revelation were as intimately related as a lock\nand its key.\n\n\"It's all my fault,\" she told herself.  \"It must be my fault.\"  And\nDumont, unanalytic and self-absorbed, was amused whenever Pauline's\ngentleness reminded him of his mother's half-believed warnings that his\nwife had \"a will of her own, and a mighty strong one.\"\n\nThey were back at Saint X in August and lived at the Frobisher place in\nIndiana Street--almost as pretentious as the Dumont homestead and in\nbetter taste.  Old Mrs. Dumont had gone to Chicago alone for the\nfurnishings for her own house; when she went for the furnishings for\nher son's house, she got Mrs. Gardiner to go along--and Pauline's\nmother gave another of her many charming illustrations of the valuable\ntruth that tact can always have its own way.  Saint X was too keen-eyed\nand too interested in the new Mrs. Dumont to fail to note a change in\nher.  It was satisfied with the surface explanation that Europe in\ngeneral and Paris in particular were responsible.  And it did not note\nthat, while she had always been full of life and fond of company, she\nwas now feverish in her restlessness, incessantly seeking distraction,\nnever alone when she could either go somewhere or induce some one to\ncome to her.\n\n\"You MUST be careful, my dear,\" said her mother-in-law, as soon as she\nlearned that she had a grandmotherly interest in her daughter-in-law's\nhealth.  \"You'll wear yourself out with all this running about.\"\n\nPauline laughed carelessly, recklessly.\n\n\"Oh, I'm disgustingly healthy.  Nothing hurts me.  Besides, if I were\nquiet, I think I should--EXPLODE!\"\n\nLate in September Dumont had to go to New York.  He asked her to go\nwith him, assuming that she would decline, as she had visitors coming.\nBut she was only too glad of the chance to give her increasing\nrestlessness wider range.  They went to the Waldorf--Scarborough and\nPierson had been stopping there not a week before, making ready for\nthat sensational descent upon Battle Field which has already been\nrecorded.  The first evening Dumont took her to the play.  The next\nmorning he left her early for a busy day down-town--\"and I may not be\nable to return for dinner.  I warned you before we left Saint X,\" he\nsaid, as he rose from breakfast in their sitting-room.\n\n\"I understand,\" she answered.  \"You needn't bother to send word even,\nif you don't wish.  I'll be tired from shopping and shan't care to go\nout this evening, anyhow.\"\n\nIn the afternoon she drove with Mrs. Fanshaw, wife of one of Jack's\nbusiness acquaintances--they had dined at the Fanshaws' when they\npaused in New York on the way home from Europe. Pauline was at the\nhotel again at five; while she and Mrs. Fanshaw were having tea\ntogether in the palm garden a telegram was handed to her.  She read it,\nthen said to Mrs. Fanshaw:  \"I was going to ask you and your husband to\ndine with us.  Jack sends word he can't be here, but--why shouldn't you\ncome just the same?\"\n\n\"No you must go with us,\" Mrs. Fanshaw replied.  \"We've got a box at\nWeber and Fields', and two men asked, and we need another woman.  I'd\nhave asked you before, but there wouldn't be room for any more men.\"\n\nMrs. Fanshaw had to insist until she had proved that the invitation was\nsincere; then, Pauline accepted--a distraction was always agreeable,\nnever so agreeable as when it offered itself unannounced.  It was\ntoward the end of the dinner that Mrs. Fanshaw happened to say:  \"I see\nyour husband's like all of them.  I don't believe there ever was a\nwoman an American man wouldn't desert for business.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't in the least mind,\" replied Pauline.  \"I like him to show\nthat he feels free.  Why, when we were in Paris on the return trip and\nhad been married only two months, he got tangled up in business and\nused to leave me for a day--for two days, once.\"\n\nAt Pauline's right sat a carefully dressed young man whose name she had\nnot caught--she learned afterward that he was Mowbray Langdon.  He was\nnow giving her a stare of amused mock-admiration.  When he saw that he\nhad her attention, he said: \"Really, Mrs. Dumont, I can't decide which\nto admire most--YOUR trust or your husband's.\"\n\nPauline laughed--it struck her as ridiculous that either she or Jack\nshould distrust the other.  Indeed, she only hazily knew what distrust\nmeant, and hadn't any real belief that \"such things\" actually existed.\n\nHalf an hour later the party was driving up to Weber and Fields'.\nPauline, glancing across the thronged sidewalk and along the empty,\nbrilliantly lighted passage leading into the theater, saw a striking,\npeculiar-looking woman standing at the box-office while her escort\nparleyed with the clerk within.  \"How much that man looks like Jack,\"\nshe said to herself--and then she saw that it was indeed Jack.  Not the\nJack she thought she knew, but quite another person, the one he tried\nto hide from her--too carelessly, because he made the common mistake of\nunderestimating the sagacity of simplicity.  A glance at the woman, a\nsecond glance at Dumont, his flushed, insolent face now turned full\nfront--and she KNEW this unfamiliar and hitherto-only-hinted Jack.\n\nThe omnibus was caught in a jam of cars and carriages; there were\nseveral moments of confusion and excitement.  When the Fanshaw party\nwas finally able to descend, she saw that Jack and his companion were\ngone--the danger of a scene was over for the moment.  She lingered and\nmade the others linger, wishing to give him time to get to his seats.\nWhen they entered the theater it was dark and the curtain was up.  But\nher eyes, searching the few boxes visible from the rear aisle, found\nthe woman, or, at least, enough of her for recognition--the huge black\nhat with its vast pale blue feather.  Pauline drew a long breath of\nrelief when the Fanshaws' box proved to be almost directly beneath, the\nbox.\n\nIf she had been a few years older, she would have given its proper\nsignificance to the curious fact that this sudden revelation of the\ntruth about her husband did not start a tempest of anger or jealousy,\nbut set her instantly to sacrificing at the shrine of the great god\nAppearances.  It is notorious that of all the household gods he alone\nerects his altar only upon the hearth where the ashes are cold.\n\nAs she sat there through the two acts, she seemed to be watching the\nstage and taking part in the conversation of the Fanshaws and their\nfriends; yet afterward she could not recall a single thing that had\noccurred, a single word that had been said.  At the end of the last act\nshe again made them linger so that they were the last to emerge into\nthe passage.  In the outside doorway, she saw the woman--just a glimpse\nof a pretty, empty, laughing face with a mouth made to utter\nimpertinences and eyes that invited them.\n\nMrs. Fanshaw was speaking--\"You're very tired, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Very,\" replied Pauline, with a struggle to smile.\n\n\"What a child you look!  It seems absurd that you are a married woman.\nWhy, you haven't your full growth yet.\"  And on an impulse of intuitive\nsympathy Mrs. Fanshaw pressed her arm, and Pauline was suddenly filled\nwith gratitude, and liked her from that moment.\n\nAlone in her sitting-room at the hotel, she went up to the mirror over\nthe mantel, and, staring absently at herself, put her hands up\nmechanically to take out her hat-pins.  \"No, I'll keep my hat on,\" she\nthought, without knowing why.  And she sat, hat and wrap on, and looked\nat a book.  Half an hour, and she took off her hat and wrap, put them\nin a chair near where she was sitting. The watched hands of the clock\ncrawled wearily round to half-past one, to two, to half-past two, to\nthree--each half-hour an interminable stage.  She wandered to the\nwindow and looked down into empty Fifth Avenue.  When she felt that at\nleast an hour had passed, she turned to look at the clock\nagain--twenty-five minutes to four.  Her eyes were heavy.\n\n\"He is not coming,\" she said aloud, and, leaving the lights on in the\nsitting-room, locked herself in the bedroom.\n\nAt five o'clock she started up and seized the dressing-gown on the\nchair near the head of the bed.  She listened--heard him muttering in\nthe sitting-room.  She knew now that a crash of some kind had roused\nher.  Several minutes of profound silence, then through the door came a\nsteady, heavy snore.\n\nThe dressing-gown dropped from her hand.  She slid from the bed, slowly\ncrossed the room, softly opened the door, looked into the sitting-room.\nA table and a chair lay upset in the middle of the floor.  He was on a\nsofa, sprawling, disheveled, snoring.\n\nSlowly she advanced toward him--she was barefooted, and the white\nnightgown clinging to her slender figure and the long braid down her\nback made her look as young as her soul--the soul that gazed from her\nfixed, fascinated eyes, the soul of a girl of eighteen, full as much\nchild as woman still.  She sat down before him in a low chair, her\nelbows on her knees, her chin supported by her hands, her eyes never\nleaving his swollen, dark red, brutish face--a cigar stump, much\nchewed, lay upon his cheek near his open mouth.  He was as absurd and\nas repulsive as a gorged pig asleep in a wallow.\n\nThe dawn burst into broad day, but she sat on motionless until the\nclock struck the half-hour after six.  Then she returned to the bedroom\nand locked herself in again.\n\nToward noon she dressed and went into the sitting-room.  He was gone\nand it had been put to rights.  When he came, at twenty minutes to one,\nshe was standing at the window, but she did not turn.\n\n\"Did you get my note?\" he asked, in a carefully careless tone. He went\non to answer himself:  \"No, there it is on the floor just where I put\nit, under the bedroom door.  No matter--it was only to say I had to go\nout but would be back to lunch.  Sorry I was kept so late last night.\nGlad you didn't wait up for me--but you might have left the bedroom\ndoor open--it'd have been perfectly safe.\"  He laughed good-naturedly.\n\"As it was, I was so kind-hearted that I didn't disturb you, but slept\non the sofa.\"\n\nAs he advanced toward her with the obvious intention of kissing her,\nshe slowly turned and faced him.  Their eyes met and he stopped\nshort--her look was like the eternal ice that guards the pole.\n\n\"I saw you at the theater last night,\" she said evenly.  \"And this\nmorning, I sat and watched you as you lay on the sofa over there.\"\n\nHe was taken completely off his guard.  With a gasp that was a kind of\ngroan he dropped into a chair, the surface of his mind strewn with the\nwreckage of the lying excuses he had got ready.\n\n\"Please don't try to explain,\" she went on in the same even tone.  \"I\nunderstand now about--about Paris and--everything.  I know that--father\nwas right.\"\n\nHe gave her a terrified glance--no tears, no trace of excitement, only\ncalmness and all the strength he knew was in her nature and, in\naddition, a strength he had not dreamed was there.\n\n\"What do you intend to do?\" he asked after a long silence.\n\nShe did not answer immediately.  When she did, she was not looking at\nhim.\n\n\"When I married you--across the river from Battle Field,\" she said, \"I\ncommitted a crime against my father and mother.  This is--my\npunishment--the beginning of it.  And now--there'll be\nthe--the--baby--\"  A pause, then:  \"I must bear the consequences--if I\ncan.  But I shall not be your wife--never--never again.  If you wish me\nto stay on that condition, I'll try.  If not--\"\n\n\"You MUST stay, Pauline,\" he interrupted.  \"I don't care what terms you\nmake, you must stay.  It's no use for me to try to defend myself when\nyou're in this mood.  You wouldn't listen. But you're right about not\ngoing.  If you did, it'd break your father's and mother's hearts.  I\nadmit I did drink too much last night, and made a fool of myself.  But\nif you were more experienced, you'd--\"\n\nHe thought he had worked his courage up to the point where he could\nmeet her eyes.  He tried it.  Her look froze his flow of words.  \"I\nKNOW that you were false from the beginning,\" she said.\n\n\"The man I thought you were never existed--and I know it.  We won't\nspeak of this--ever--after now.  Surely you can't wish me to stay?\"\nAnd into her voice surged all her longing to go, all her hope that he\nwould reject the only terms on which self-respect would let her stay.\n\n\"Wish you to stay?\" he repeated.  And he faced her, looking at her, his\nchest heaving under the tempest of hate and passion that was raging in\nhim--hate because she was defying and dictating to him, passion because\nshe was so beautiful as she stood there, like a delicate, fine\nhot-house rose poised on a long, graceful stem.  \"No wonder I LOVE\nyou!\" he exclaimed between his clenched teeth.\n\nA bright spot burned in each of her cheeks and her look made him redden\nand lower his eyes.\n\n\"Now that I understand these last five months,\" she said, \"that from\nyou is an insult.\"\n\nHis veins and muscles swelled with the fury he dared not show; for he\nsaw and felt how dangerous her mood was.\n\n\"I'll agree to whatever you like, Pauline,\" he said humbly. \"Only, we\nmustn't have a flare-up and a scandal.  I'll never speak to you again\nabout--about anything you don't want to hear.\"\n\nShe went into her bedroom.  When, after half an hour, she reappeared,\nshe was ready to go down to lunch.  In the elevator he stole a glance\nat her--there was no color in her face, not even in her lips.  His rage\nhad subsided; he was ashamed of himself--before her.  But he felt\ntriumphant too.\n\n\"I thought she'd go, sure, in spite of her fear of hurting her father\nand mother,\" he said to himself.  \"A mighty close squeak.  I was\nstepping round in a powder magazine, with every word a lit match.\"\n\n\nIn January she sank into a profound lassitude.  Nothing interested her,\neverything wearied her.  As the time drew near, her mother came to stay\nwith her; and day after day the two women sat silent, Mrs. Gardiner\nknitting, Pauline motionless, hands idle in her lap, mind vacant.  If\nshe had any emotion, it was a hope that she would die and take her\nchild with her.\n\n\"That would settle everything, settle it right,\" she reflected, with\nyouth's morbid fondness for finalities.\n\nWhen it was all over and she came out from under the opiate, she lay\nfor a while, open-eyed but unseeing, too inert to grope for the lost\nthread of memory.  She felt a stirring in the bed beside her, the\nmovement of some living thing.  She looked and there, squeezed into the\nedge of the pillow was a miniature head of a little old man--wrinkled,\ncopperish.  Yet the face was fat--ludicrously fat.  A painfully homely\nface with tears running from the closed eyes, with an open mouth that\ndriveled and drooled.\n\n\"What is it?\" she thought, looking with faint curiosity.  \"And why is\nit here?\"\n\nTwo small fists now rose aimlessly in the air above the face and\nflapped about; and a very tempest of noise issued from the sagging\nmouth.\n\n\"A baby,\" she reflected.  Then memory came--\"MY baby!\"\n\nShe put her finger in the way of the wandering fists.  First one of\nthem, then the other, awkwardly unclosed and as awkwardly closed upon\nit.  She smiled.  The grip tightened and tightened and tightened until\nshe wondered how hands so small and new could cling so close and hard.\nThen that electric clasp suddenly tightened about her heart.  She burst\ninto tears and drew the child against her breast.  The pulse of its\ncurrent of life was beating against her own--and she felt it.  She\nsobbed, laughed softly, sobbed again.\n\nHer mother was bending anxiously over her.\n\n\"What's the matter, dearest?\" she asked.  \"What do you wish?\"\n\n\"Nothing!\" Pauline was smiling through her tears.  \"Oh, mother, I am SO\nhappy!\" she murmured.\n\nAnd her happiness lasted with not a break, with hardly a pause, all\nthat spring and all that summer--or, so long as her baby's helplessness\nabsorbed the whole of her time and thought.\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nYOUNG AMERICA.\n\nWhen Pierson, laggard as usual, returned to Battle Field a week after\nthe end of the long vacation, he found Scarborough just establishing\nhimself.  He had taken two small and severely plain rooms in a quaint\nold frame cottage, one story high, but perched importantly upon a bank\nat the intersection of two much-traveled streets.\n\n\"What luck?\" asked Pierson, lounging in on him.\n\n\"A hundred days' campaign; a thousand dollars net,\" replied the book\nagent.  \"And I'm hard as oak from tramping those roads, and I've\nlearned--you ought to have been along, Pierson.  I know people as I\nnever could have come to know them by any other means--what they think,\nwhat they want, how they can be reached.\"\n\nThere was still much of the boy in Pierson's face.  But Scarborough\nlooked the man, developed, ready.\n\nPierson wandered into the bedroom to complete his survey.  \"I see\nyou're going to live by the clock,\" he called out presently. He had\nfound, pasted to the wall, Scarborough's schedule of the daily division\nof his time; just above it, upon a shelf, was a new alarm clock, the\nbell so big that it overhung like a canopy. \"You don't mean you're\ngoing to get up at four?\"\n\n\"Every morning--all winter,\" replied Scarborough, without stopping his\nunpacking.  \"You see, I'm going to finish this year--take the two years\nin one.  Then I've registered in a law office--Judge Holcombe's.  And\nthere's my speaking--I must practise that every day.\"\n\nPierson came back to the sitting-room and collapsed into a chair. \"I\nsee you allow yourself five hours for sleep,\" he said. \"It's too much,\nold man.  You're self-indulgent.\"\n\n\"That's a mistake,\" replied Scarborough. \"Since making out the schedule\nI've decided to cut sleep down to four hours and a half.\"\n\n\"That's more like it!\"\n\n\"We all sleep too much,\" he continued.  \"And as I shan't smoke, or\ndrink, or worry, I'll need even less than the average man.  I'm going\nto do nothing but work.  A man doesn't need much rest from mere work.\"\n\n\"What!  No play?\"\n\n\"Play all the time.  I've simply changed my playthings.\"\n\nPierson seated himself at the table and stared gloomily at his friend.\n\n\"Look here, old man.  For heaven's sake, don't let Olivia find out\nabout this program.\"\n\nBut Olivia did hear of it, and Pierson was compelled to leave his\nluxury in the main street and to take the two remaining available rooms\nat Scarborough's place.  His bed was against the wall of Scarborough's\nbedroom--the wall where the alarm clock was.  At four o'clock on his\nfirst morning he started from a profound sleep.\n\n\"My bed must be moved into my sitting-room to-day,\" he said to himself\nas soon as the clamor of Scarborough's gong died away and he could\ncollect his thoughts.  But at four o'clock the next morning the gong\npenetrated the two walls as if they had not been there.  \"I see my\nfinish,\" he groaned, sitting up and tearing at his hair.\n\nHe tried to sleep again, but the joint pressure of Olivia's\nmemory-mirrored gray eyes and of disordered nerves from the racking\ngong forced him to make an effort to bestir himself. Groaning and\nmuttering, he rose and in the starlight looked from his window.\nScarborough was going up the deserted street on his way to the woods\nfor his morning exercise.  His head was thrown back and his chest\nextended, and his long legs were covering four feet at a stride.  \"You\nold devil!\" said Pierson, his tone suggesting admiration and affection\nrather than anger.  \"But I'll outwit you.\"\n\nBy a subterfuge in which a sympathetic doctor was the main factor, he\nhad himself permanently excused from chapel.  Then he said to\nScarborough:  \"You get up too late, old man.  My grandfather used to\nsay that only a drone lies abed after two in the morning, wasting the\nbest part of the day.  You ought to turn in, say, at half-past nine and\nrise in time to get your hardest work out of the way before the college\nday begins.\"\n\n\"That sounds reasonable,\" replied Scarborough, after a moment's\nconsideration.  \"I'll try it.\"\n\nAnd so it came to pass that Pierson went to bed at the sound of\nScarborough's two-o'clock rising gong and pieced out his sleep with an\noccasional nap in recitations and lectures and for an hour or two late\nin the afternoon.  He was able once more to play poker as late as he\nliked, and often had time for reading before the gong sounded.  And\nScarborough was equally delighted with the new plan.  \"I gain at least\none hour a day, perhaps two,\" he said.  \"Your grandfather was a wise\nman.\"\n\nToward spring, Mills, western manager of the publishing house for which\nScarborough had sold Peaks of Progress through Michigan, came to Battle\nField to see him.\n\n\"You were far and away the best man we had out last year,\" said he.\n\"You're a born book agent.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Scarborough, sincerely.  He appreciated that a man\ncan pay no higher compliment than to say that another is master of his\nown trade.\n\n\"We got about fifty orders from people who thought it over after you'd\ntried to land them and failed--that shows the impression you made.  And\nyou sold as many books as our best agent in our best field.\"\n\n\"I'll never go as agent again,\" said Scarborough.  \"The experience was\ninvaluable--but sufficient.\"\n\n\"We don't want you to go as agent.  Our proposition is for much easier\nand more dignified work.\"\n\nAt the word dignified, Scarborough could not restrain a smile. \"I've\npractically made my plans for the summer,\" he said.\n\n\"I think we've got something worth your while, Mr. Scarborough. Our\nidea is for you to select about a hundred of the young fellows who're\nworking their way through here, and train them in your methods of\napproaching people.  Then you'll take them to Wisconsin and Minnesota\nand send them out, each man to a district you select for him.  In that\nway you'll help a hundred young men to earn a year at college and\nyou'll make a good sum for yourself--two or three times what you made\nlast summer.\"\n\nScarborough had intended to get admitted to the bar in June, to spend\nthe summer at an apprenticeship in a law office and to set up for\nhimself in the fall.  But this plan was most attractive--it would give\nhim a new kind of experience and would put him in funds for the wait\nfor clients.  The next day he signed an advantageous contract--his\nexpenses for the summer and a guaranty of not less than three thousand\ndollars clear.\n\nHe selected a hundred young men and twelve young women, the most\nintelligent of the five hundred self-supporting students at Battle\nField.  Pierson, having promised to behave himself, was permitted to\nattend the first lesson.  The scholars at the Scarborough, School for\nBook Agents filled his quarters and overflowed in swarms without the\nwindows and the door.  The weather was still cool; but all must hear,\nand the rooms would hold barely half the brigade.\n\n\"I assume that you've read the book,\" began Scarborough.  He was\nstanding at the table with the paraphernalia of a book agent spread\nupon it.  \"But you must read it again and again, until you know what's\non every page, until you have by heart the passages I'll point out to\nyou.\"  He looked at Drexel--a freshman of twenty-two, with earnest,\nsleepless eyes and a lofty forehead; in the past winter he had become\nacquainted with hunger and with that cold which creeps into the room,\ncrawls through the thin covers and closes in, icy as death, about the\nheart.  \"What do you think of the book, Drexel?\"\n\nThe young man--he is high in the national administration\nto-day--flushed and looked uneasy.\n\n\"Speak frankly.  I want your candid opinion.\"\n\n\"Well, I must say, Mr. Scarborough, I think it's pretty bad.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Scarborough; and he glanced round.  \"Does anybody\ndisagree with Mr. Drexel?\"\n\nThere was not a murmur.  Pierson covered his face to hide his smile at\nthis \"jolt\" for his friend.  In the group round one of the windows a\nlaugh started and spread everywhere except to seven of the twelve young\nwomen and to those near Scarborough--THEY looked frightened.\n\n\"I expected Mr. Drexel's answer,\" began Scarborough.  \"Before you can\nsell Peaks of Progress each of you must be convinced that it's a book\nhe himself would buy.  And I see you've not even read it.  You've at\nmost glanced at it with unfriendly eyes.  This book is not literature,\ngentlemen.  It is a storehouse of facts. It is an educational work so\nsimply written and so brilliantly illustrated that the very children\nwill hang over its pages with delight.  If you attend to your training\nin our coming three months of preliminary work you'll find during the\nsummer that the book's power to attract the children is its strongest\npoint.  I made nearly half my sales last summer by turning from the\nparents to the children and stirring their interest.\"\n\nPierson was now no more inclined to smile than were the pupils.\n\n\"When I started out,\" continued Scarborough, \"I, too, had just glanced\nat the book and had learned a few facts from the prospectus.  And I\nfailed to sell, except to an occasional fool whom I was able to\noverpower.  Every one instinctively felt the estimate I myself placed\nupon my goods.  But as I went on the book gradually forced itself upon\nme.  And, long before the summer was over, I felt that I was an\nambassador of education to those eager people.  And I'm proud that I\nsold as many books as I did.  Each book, I know, is a radiating center\nof pleasure, of thought, of aspiration to higher things.  No, ladies\nand gentlemen, you must first learn that these eight hundred pages\ncrowded with facts of history, these six hundred illustrations taken\nfrom the best sources and flooding the text with light, together\nconstitute a work that should be in all humble households.\"\n\nScarborough had his audience with him now.\n\n\"Never sneer,\" he said in conclusion.  \"Sneering will accomplish\nnothing.  Learn your business.  Put yourself, your BEST self, into it.\nAnd then you may hope to succeed at it.\"\n\nHe divided his pupils into six classes of about twenty each and\ndismissed them, asking the first class to come at three the next\nafternoon.  The young men and young women went thoughtfully away; they\nwere revolving their initial lesson in the cardinal principle of\nsuccess--enthusiasm.  When the two friends were alone Pierson said:\n\"Do you know, I'm beginning to get a glimpse of you.  And I see there\nisn't anything beyond your reach.  You'll get whatever you want.\"\n\nScarborough's reply was a sudden look of dejection, an impatient shrug.\nThen he straightened himself, lifted his head with a lion-like toss\nthat shook back the obstinate lock of hair from his forehead.  He laid\nhis hand on his friend's shoulder. \"Yes,\" he said, \"because I'm\ndetermined to want whatever I get.  Good fortune and bad--everything\nshall be grist for THIS mill.\"\n\nPierson attended next day's class and afterward went to Olivia with an\naccount of it.\n\n\"You ought to have seen him put those fellows through, one at a time.\nI tell you, he'll teach them more in the next three months than they'll\nlearn of the whole faculty.  And this summer he'll get every man and\nwoman of them enough to pay their way through college next year.\"\n\n\"What did he do to-day?\" asked Olivia.  Of the many qualities she loved\nin Pierson, the one she loved most was his unbounded, unselfish\nadmiration for his friend.\n\n\"He took each man separately, the others watching and listening. First\nhe'd play the part of book agent with his pupil as a reluctant\ncustomer.  Then he'd reverse, and the pupil as agent would try to sell\nhim the book, he pretending to be an ignorant, obstinate, ill-natured,\nclose-fisted farmer or farmer's wife.  It was a liberal education in\nthe art of persuasion.  If his pupils had his brains and his\npersonality, Peaks of Progress would be on the center-table in half the\nfarm parlors of Wisconsin and Minnesota by September.\"\n\n\"IF they had his personality, and IF they had his brains,\" said Olivia.\n\n\"Well, as it is, he'll make the dumbest ass in the lot bray to some\npurpose.\"\n\nIn September, when Scarborough closed his headquarters at Milwaukee and\nset out for Indianapolis, he found that the average earnings of his\nagents were two hundred and seventy-five dollars, and that he himself\nhad made forty-three hundred.  Mills came and offered him a place in\nthe publishing house at ten thousand a year and a commission.  He\ninstantly rejected it.  He had already arranged to spend a year with\none of the best law firms in Indianapolis before opening an office in\nSaint X, the largest town in the congressional district in which his\nfarm lay.\n\n\"But there's no hurry about deciding,\" said Mills.  \"Remember we'll\nmake you rich in a few years.\"\n\n\"My road happens not to lie in that direction,\" replied Scarborough,\ncarelessly.  \"I've no desire to be rich.  It's too easy, if one will\nconsent to give money-making his exclusive attention.\"\n\nMills looked amused--had he not known Scarborough's ability, he would\nhave felt derisive.\n\n\"Money's power,\" said he.  \"And there are only two ambitions for a\nwide-awake man--money and power.\"\n\n\"Money can't buy the kind of power I'd care for,\" answered Scarborough.\n\"If I were to seek power, it'd be the power that comes through ability\nto persuade.\"\n\n\"Money talks,\" said Mills, laughing.\n\n\"Money bellows,\" retorted Scarborough, \"and bribes and browbeats, bully\nand coward that it is.  But it never persuades.\"\n\n\"I'll admit it's a coward.\"\n\n\"And I hope I can always frighten enough of it into my service to\nsatisfy my needs.  But I'm not spending my life in its service--no,\nthank you!\"\n\n\n\nXII.\n\nAFTER EIGHT YEARS.\n\nWhile Scarborough was serving his clerkship at Indianapolis, Dumont was\nengaging in ever larger and more daring speculations with New York as\nhis base.  Thus it came about that when Scarborough established himself\nat Saint X, Dumont and Pauline were living in New York, in a big house\nin East Sixty-first Street.\n\nAnd Pauline had welcomed the change.  In Saint X she was constantly on\nguard, always afraid her father and mother would see below that smiling\nsurface of her domestic life which made them happy.  In New York she\nwas free from the crushing sense of peril and restraint, as their\ndelusions about her were secure. There, after she and he found their\nliving basis of \"let alone,\" they got on smoothly, rarely meeting\nexcept in the presence of servants or guests, never inquiring either\ninto the other's life, carrying on all negotiations about money and\nother household matters through their secretaries. He thought her cold\nby nature--therefore absolutely to be trusted. And what other man with\nthe pomp and circumstance of a great and growing fortune to maintain\nhad so admirable an instrument?  \"An ideal wife,\" he often said to\nhimself.  And he was not the man to speculate as to what was going on\nin her head.  He had no interest in what others thought; how they were\nfilling the places he had assigned them--that was his only concern.\n\nIn one of those days of pause which come now and then in the busiest\nlives she chanced upon his letters from Europe in her winter at Battle\nField.  She took one of them from its envelope and began to\nread--carelessly, with a languid curiosity to measure thus exactly the\nchange in herself.  But soon she was absorbed, her mind groping through\nletter after letter for the clue to a mystery.  The Dumont she now knew\nstood out so plainly in those letters that she could not understand how\nshe, inexperienced and infatuated though she then was, had failed to\nsee the perfect full-length portrait.  How had she read romance and\nhigh-mindedness and intellect into the personality so frankly flaunting\nitself in all its narrow sordidness, in all its poverty of real thought\nand real feeling?\n\nAnd there was Hampden Scarborough to contrast him with. With this\nthought the truth suddenly stared at her, made her drop the letter and\nvisibly shrink.  It was just because Scarborough was there that she had\nbeen tricked.  The slight surface resemblance between the two men,\nhardly more than the \"favor\" found in all men of the family of strong\nand tenacious will, had led her on to deck the absent Dumont with the\nmanhood of the present Scarborough.  She had read Scarborough into\nDumont's letters. Yes, and--the answers she addressed and mailed to\nDumont had really been written to Scarborough.\n\nShe tossed the letters back into the box from which they had reappeared\nafter four long years.  She seated herself on the white bear-skin\nbefore the open fire; and with hands clasped round her knees she rocked\nherself slowly to and fro like one trying to ease an intolerable pain.\n\nUntil custom dulled the edge of that pain, the days and the nights were\nthe cruelest in her apprenticeship up to that time.\n\nWhen her boy, Gardiner, was five years old, she got her father and\nmother to keep him at Saint X with them.\n\n\"New York's no place, I think, to bring up and educate a boy in the\nright way,\" she explained.  And it was the truth, though not the whole\ntruth.  The concealed part was that she would have made an open break\nwith her husband had there been no other way of safeguarding their\nall-seeing, all-noting boy from his example.\n\nBefore Gardiner went to live with his grandparents she stayed in the\nEast, making six or eight brief visits \"home\" each year. When he went\nshe resolved to divide her year between her pleasure as a mother and\nher obligation to her son's father, to her parents' son-in-law--her\ndevotions at the shrine of Appearances.\n\nIt was in the fall of the year she was twenty-five--eight years and a\nhalf after she left Battle Field--that Hampden Scarborough reappeared\nupon the surface of her life.\n\nOn a September afternoon in that year Olivia, descending from the train\nat Saint X, was almost as much embarrassed as pleased by her changed\nyoung cousin rushing at her with great energy--\"Dear, dear Olivia!  And\nhardly any different--how's the baby?  No--not Fred, but Fred Junior, I\nmean.  In some ways you positively look younger.  You know, you were SO\nserious at college!\"\n\n\"But you--I don't quite understand how any one can be so changed,\nyet--recognizable.  I guess it's the plumage.  You're in a new\nedition--an edition deluxe.\"\n\nPauline's dressmakers were bringing out the full value of her height\nand slender, graceful strength.  Her eyes, full of the same old\nfrankness and courage, now had experience in them, too. She was wearing\nher hair so that it fell from her brow in two sweeping curves\nreflecting the light in sparkles and flashes. Her manner was still\nsimple and genuine--the simplicity and genuineness of knowledge now,\nnot of innocence.  Extremes meet--but they remain extremes.  Her\n\"plumage\" was a fashionable dress of pale blue cloth, a big beplumed\nhat to match, a chiffon parasol like an azure cloud, at her throat a\nsapphire pendant, about her neck and swinging far below her waist a\nchain of sapphires.\n\n\"And the plumage just suits her,\" thought Olivia.  For it seemed to her\nthat her cousin had more than ever the quality she most admired--the\nquality of individuality, of distinction.  Even in her way of looking\nclean and fresh she was different, as if those prime feminine\nessentials were in her not matters of frequent reacquirement but\ninherent and inalienable, like her brilliance of eyes and smoothness of\nskin.\n\nOlivia felt a slight tugging at the bag she was carrying.  She\nlooked--an English groom in spotless summer livery was touching his hat\nin respectful appeal to her to let go.  \"Give Albert your checks, too,\"\nsaid Pauline, putting her arm around her cousin's waist to escort her\ndown the platform.  At the entrance, with a group of station loungers\ngaping at it, was a phaeton-victoria lined with some cream-colored\nstuff like silk, the horses and liveried coachman rigid.  \"She's giving\nSaint X a good deal to talk about,\" thought Olivia.\n\n\"Home, please, by the long road,\" said Pauline to the groom, and he\nsprang to the box beside the coachman, and they were instantly in rapid\nmotion.  \"That'll let us have twenty minutes more together,\" she went\non to Olivia.  \"There are several people stopping at the house.\"\n\nThe way led through Munroe Avenue, the main street of Saint X. Olivia\nwas astonished at the changes--the town of nine years before spread and\nremade into an energetic city of twenty-five thousand.\n\n\"Fred told me I'd hardly recognize it,\" said she, \"but I didn't expect\nthis.  It's another proof how far-sighted Hampden Scarborough is.\nEverybody advised him against coming here, but he would come.  And the\ntown has grown, and at the same time he's had a clear field to make a\nbig reputation as a lawyer in a few years, not to speak of the power\nhe's got in politics.\"\n\n\"But wouldn't he have won no matter where he was?\" suggested Pauline.\n\n\"Sooner or later--but not so soon,\" replied Olivia.\n\n\"No--a tree doesn't have to grow so tall among a lot of bushes before\nit's noticed as it does in a forest.\"\n\n\"And you've never seen him since Battle Field?\"  As Olivia put this\nquestion she watched her cousin narrowly without seeming to do so.\n\n\"But,\" replied Pauline--and Olivia thought that both her face and her\ntone were a shade off the easy and the natural--\"since he came I've\nbeen living in New York and haven't stayed here longer than a few days\nuntil this summer.  And he's been in Europe since April.  No,\" she went\non, \"I've not seen a soul from Battle Field.  It's been like a\npainting, finished and hanging on the wall one looks toward oftenest,\nand influencing one's life every day.\"\n\nThey talked on of Battle Field, of the boys and girls they had\nknown--how Thiebaud was dead and Mollie Crittenden had married the man\nwho was governor of California; what Howe was not doing, the novels\nChamberlayne was writing; the big women's college in Kansas that Grace\nWharton was vice-president of.  Then of Pierson--in the state senate\nand in a fair way to get to Congress the next year.  Then Scarborough\nagain--how he had distanced all the others; how he might have the\nlargest practice in the state if he would take the sort of clients most\nlawyers courted assiduously; how strong he was in politics in spite of\nthe opposition of the professionals--strong because he had a genius for\norganization and also had the ear and the confidence of the people and\nthe enthusiastic personal devotion of the young men throughout the\nstate.  Olivia, more of a politician than Fred even, knew the whole\nstory; and Pauline listened appreciatively. Few indeed are the homes in\nstrenuously political Indiana where politics is not the chief subject\nof conversation, and Pauline had known about parties and campaigns as\nearly as she had known about dolls and dresses.\n\n\"But you must have heard most of this,\" said Olivia, \"from people here\nin Saint X.\"\n\n\"Some of it--from father and mother,\" Pauline answered. \"They're the\nonly people I've seen really to talk to on my little visits.  They know\nhim very well indeed.  I think mother admires him almost as much as you\ndo.  Here's our place,\" she added, the warmth fading from her face as\nfrom a spring landscape when the shadow of the dusk begins to creep\nover it.\n\nThey were in the grounds of the Eyrie--the elder Dumont was just\ncompleting it when he died early in the previous spring.  His widow\nwent abroad to live with her daughter and her sister in Paris; so her\nson and his wife had taken it.  It was a great rambling stone house\nthat hung upon and in a lofty bluff.  From its windows and verandas and\nbalconies could be seen the panorama of Saint Christopher.  To the left\nlay the town, its ugly part--its factories and railway yards--hidden by\nthe jut of a hill.  Beneath and beyond to the right, the shining river\nwound among fields brown where the harvests had been gathered, green\nand white where myriads of graceful tassels waved above acres on acres\nof Indian corn.  And the broad leaves sent up through the murmur of the\nriver a rhythmic rustling like a sigh of content. Once in a while a\npassing steamboat made the sonorous cry of its whistle and the\nmelodious beat of its paddles echo from hill to hill.  Between the\nhouse and the hilltop, highway lay several hundred acres of lawn and\ngarden and wood.\n\nThe rooms of the Eyrie and its well-screened verandas were in a cool\ntwilight, though the September sun was hot.\n\n\"They're all out, or asleep,\" said Pauline, as she and Olivia entered\nthe wide reception hall.  \"Let's have tea on the east veranda.  Its\nview isn't so good, but we'll be cooler.  You'd like to go to your room\nfirst?\"\n\nOlivia said she was comfortable as she was and needed the tea. So they\nwent on through the splendidly-furnished drawing-room and were going\nthrough the library when Olivia paused before a portrait--\"Your\nhusband, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Pauline, standing behind her cousin.  \"We each had one\ndone in Paris.\"\n\n\"What a masterful face!\" said Olivia.  \"I've never seen a better\nforehead.\"  And she thought,\n\n\"He's of the same type as Scarborough, except--what is it I dislike in\nhis expression?\"\n\n\"Do you notice a resemblance to any one you know?\" asked Pauline.\n\n\"Ye-e-s,\" replied Olivia, coloring.  \"I think----\"\n\n\"Scarborough, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted Olivia.\n\nAfter a pause Pauline said ambiguously:  \"The resemblance is stronger\nthere than in life.\"\n\nOlivia glanced at her and was made vaguely uneasy by the look she was\ndirecting at the face of the portrait.  But though Pauline must have\nseen that she was observed, she did not change expression.  They went\nout upon the east veranda and Olivia stood at the railing.  She hardly\nnoted the view in the press of thoughts roused by the hints of what was\nbehind the richly embroidered curtain of her cousin's life.\n\nAll along the bluff, some exposed, some half hid by dense foliage, were\nthe pretentious houses of the thirty or forty families who had grown\nrich through the industries developed within the past ten years.  Two\nforeign-looking servants in foreign-looking house-liveries were\nbringing a table on which was an enormous silver tray with a\ntea-service of antique silver and artistic china.  As Olivia turned to\nseat herself a young man and a woman of perhaps forty, obviously from\nthe East, came through the doors at the far end of the long porch.\nBoth were in white, carefully dressed and groomed; both suggested a\nmode of life whose leisure had never been interrupted.\n\n\"Who are coming?\" asked Olivia.  She wished she had gone to her room\nbefore tea.  These people made her feel dowdy and mussy.\n\nPauline glanced round, smiled and nodded, turned back to her cousin.\n\n\"Mrs. Herron and Mr. Langdon.  She's the wife of a New York lawyer, and\nshe takes Mr. Langdon everywhere with her to amuse her, and he goes to\namuse himself.  He's a socialist, or something like that.  He thinks up\nand says things to shock conservative, conventional people.  He's rich\nand never has worked--couldn't if he would, probably.  But he denounces\nleisure classes and large fortunes and advocates manual labor every day\nfor everybody.  He's clever in a queer, cynical way.\"\n\nA Mrs. Fanshaw, also of New York, came from the library in a tea-gown\nof chiffon and real lace.  All were made acquainted and Pauline poured\nthe tea.  As Olivia felt shy and was hungry, she ate the little\nsandwiches and looked and listened and thought--looked and thought\nrather than listened.  These were certainly well-bred people, yet she\ndid not like them.\n\n\"They're in earnest about trifles,\" she said to herself, \"and trifle\nabout earnest things.\"  Yet it irritated her to feel that, though they\nwould care not at all for her low opinion of them, she did care a great\ndeal because they would fail to appreciate her.\n\n\"They ought to be jailed,\" Langdon was drawling with considerable\nemphasis.\n\n\"Who, Mr. Langdon?\" inquired Mrs. Fanshaw--she had been as abstracted\nas Olivia.  \"You've been filling the jails rapidly to-day, and hanging\nnot a few.\"\n\nMrs. Herron laughed.  \"He says your husband and Mrs. Dumont's and mine\nshould be locked up as conspirators.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Langdon, tranquilly.  \"They'll sign a few papers, and\nwhen they're done, what'll have happened?  Not one more sheep'll be\nraised.  Not one more pound of wool will be shorn.  Not one more\nlaborer'll be employed.  Not a single improvement in any process of\nmanufacture.  But, on the other hand, the farmer'll have to sell his\nwool cheaper, the consumer'll have to pay a bigger price for blankets\nand all kinds of clothes, for carpets--for everything wool goes into.\nAnd these few men will have trebled their fortunes and at least trebled\ntheir incomes.  Does anybody deny that such a performance is a crime?\nWhy, in comparison, a burglar is honorable and courageous.  HE risks\nliberty and life.\"\n\n\"Dreadful!  Dreadful!\" exclaimed Mrs. Fanshaw, in mock horror. \"You\nmust go at once, Mowbray, and lead the police in a raid on Jack's\noffice.\"\n\n\"Thanks--it's more comfortable here.\"  Langdon took a piece of a\ncurious-looking kind of hot bread.  \"Extraordinary good stuff this is,\"\nhe interjected; then went on:  \"And I've done my duty when I've stated\nthe facts.  Also, I'm taking a little stock in the new trust.  But I\ndon't pose as a 'captain of industry' or 'promoter of civilization.'  I\nadmit I'm a robber.  My point is the rotten hypocrisy of my fellow\nbandits--no, pickpockets, by gad!\"\n\nOlivia looked at him with disapproving interest.  It was the first time\nshe had been present at a game of battledore and shuttlecock with what\nshe regarded as fundamental morals. Langdon noted her expression and\nsaid to Pauline in a tone of contrition that did not conceal his\namusement:  \"I've shocked your cousin, Mrs. Dumont.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" replied Pauline.  \"I'm sure we all ought to be\nshocked--and should be, if it weren't you who are trying to do the\nshocking.  She'll soon get used to you.\"\n\n\"Then it was a jest?\" said Olivia to Langdon.\n\n\"A jest?\" He looked serious.  \"Not at all, my dear Mrs. Pierson.  Every\nword I said was true, and worse.  They----\"\n\n\"Stop your nonsense, Mowbray,\" interrupted Mrs. Herron, who appreciated\nthat Olivia was an \"outsider.\"  \"Certainly he was jesting, Mrs.\nPierson.  Mr. Langdon pretends to have eccentric ideas--one of them is\nthat everybody with brains should be put under the feet of the\nnumskulls; another is that anybody who has anything should be locked up\nand his property given to those who have nothing.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" exclaimed Langdon.  And he took out a gold cigarette case\nand lighted a large, expensive-looking cigarette with a match from a\ngold safe.  \"Go on, dear lady!  Herron should get you to write our\nprospectus when we're ready to unload on the public.  The dear public!\nHow it does yearn for a share in any piratical enterprise that flies\nthe snowy flag of respectability.\"  He rose.  \"Who'll play English\nbilliards?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Mrs. Herron, rising.\n\n\"And I, too,\" said Mrs. Fanshaw.\n\n\"Give me one of your cigarettes, Mowbray,\" said Mrs. Herron. \"I left my\ncase in my room.\"\n\nPauline, answering Olivia's expression, said as soon as the three had\ndisappeared:\n\n\"Why not?  Is it any worse for a woman than for a man?\"\n\n\"I don't know why not,\" replied Olivia.  \"There must be another reason\nthan because I don't do it, and didn't think ladies did.  But that's\nthe only reason I can give just now.\"\n\n\"What do you think of Langdon?\" asked Pauline.\n\n\"I guess my sense of humor's defective.  I don't like the sort of jest\nhe seems to excel in.\"\n\n\"I fancy it wasn't altogether a jest,\" said Pauline.  \"I don't inquire\ninto those matters any more.  I used to, but--the more I saw, the worse\nit was.  Tricks and traps and squeezes and--oh, business is all vulgar\nand low.  It's necessary, I suppose, but it's repulsive to me.\"  She\npaused, then added carelessly, yet with a certain deliberateness, \"I\nnever meddle with Mr. Dumont, nor he with me.\"\n\nOlivia wished to protest against Pauline's view of business. But--how\ncould she without seeming to attack, indeed, without attacking, her\ncousin's husband?\n\nDumont brought Fanshaw up in his automobile, Herron remaining at the\noffices for half an hour to give the newspapers a carefully considered\naccount of the much-discussed \"merger\" of the manufacturers of\nlow-grade woolens.  Herron had objected to any statement.  \"It's our\nprivate business,\" he said.  \"Let them howl.  The fewer facts they\nhave, the sooner they'll stop howling.\"  But Dumont held firm for\npublicity.  \"There's no such thing as a private business nowadays,\" he\nreplied. \"Besides, don't we want the public to take part of our stock?\nWhat's the use of acting shady--you've avoided the legal obstacles,\nhaven't you?  Let's tell the public frankly all we want it to know, and\nit'll think it knows all there is to know.\"\n\nThe whole party met in the drawing-room at a quarter-past eight,\nLangdon the last to come down--Olivia was uncertain whether or not she\nwas unjust to him when she suspected design in his late entrance, the\nhandsomest and the best-dressed man of the company.\n\nHe looked cynically at Dumont.  \"Well, fellow pirate: how go our plans\nfor a merry winter for the poor?\"\n\n\"Ass!\" muttered Herron to Olivia, who happened to, be nearest him.  \"He\nfancies impudence is wit.  He's devoid of moral sense or even of\ndecency.  He's a traitor to his class and shouldn't be tolerated in it.\"\n\nDumont was laughingly answering Langdon in his own vein.\n\n\"Splendidly,\" he replied, \"thanks to our worthy chaplain, Herron, who\nsecures us the blessing and protection of the law.\"\n\n\"That gives me an appetite!\" exclaimed Langdon.  \"I feared something\nmight miscarry in these last hours of our months of plotting.  Heaven\nbe praised, the people won't have so much to waste hereafter.  I'm\nproud to be in one of the many noble bands that are struggling to save\nthem from themselves.\"\n\nBut Dumont had turned away from him; so he dropped into Mrs. Herron's\ndiscussion with Mrs. Fanshaw on their proposed trip to the\nMediterranean.  Dinner was announced and he was put between Mrs. Herron\nand Olivia, with Dumont on her right.  It was a round table and\nOlivia's eyes lingered upon its details--the embroidered cloth with\nreal lace in the center, the graceful antique silver candlesticks, the\ntall vases filled with enormous roses--everything exquisitely simple\nand tasteful.\n\nLangdon talked with her until Mrs. Herron, impatient at his neglect,\ncaught his eye and compelled his attention.  Dumont, seeing that Olivia\nwas free, drew her into his conversation with Mrs. Fanshaw; and then\nMrs. Fanshaw began to talk with Mr. Herron, who was eating furiously\nbecause he had just overheard Langdon say:  \"That was a great day for\npirates when they thought of taking aboard the lawyers as chaplains.\"\n\nAll the men were in high spirits; Dumont was boyish in his exuberance.\nWhen he left home that morning he was four times a millionaire; now he\nwas at least twelve times a millionaire, through the magic of the\n\"merger.\"  True, eight of the twelve millions were on paper; but it was\npaper that would certainly pay dividends, paper that would presently\nsell at or near its face value.  And this success had come when he was\nonly thirty-four. His mind was already projecting greater triumphs in\nthis modern necromancy by which millionaires evoke and materialize\nmillions from the empty air--apparently.  He was bubbling over with\nhappiness--in the victory won, in victories to be won.\n\nOlivia tried him on several subjects, but the conversation dragged.  Of\nPauline he would not talk; of Europe, he was interested only in the\ncomfort of hotels and railway trains, in the comparative merits of the\ncooking and the wines in London and Paris.  But his face--alert,\nshrewd, aggressive--and his mode of expression made her feel that he\nwas uninteresting because he was thinking of something which he did not\ncare to expose to her and could not take his mind from.  And this was\nthe truth.  It was not until she adventured upon his business that he\nbecame talkative.  And soon she had him telling her about his\n\"combine\"--frankly, boastfully, his face more and more flushed, for as\nhe talked he drank.\n\n\"But,\" he said presently, \"this little matter to-day is only a fair\nbeginning.  It seemed big until it was about accomplished. Then I saw\nit was only a suggestion for a scheme that'd be really worth, while.\"\nAnd he went on to unfold one of those projects of to-day's commerce and\nfinance that were regarded as fantastic, delirious a few years ago.  He\nwould reach out and out for hundreds of millions of capital; with his\nwoolens \"combine\" as a basis he would build an enormous corporation to\ncontrol the sheep industry of the world--to buy millions of acres of\nsheep-ranges; to raise scores of millions of sheep; to acquire and to\nconstruct hundreds of plants for utilizing every part of the raw\nproduct of the ranges; to sell wherever the human race had or could\nhave a market.\n\nOlivia was ambitious herself, usually was delighted by ambition in\nothers.  But his exhibit of imagination and energy repelled her, even\nwhile it fascinated.  Partly through youth, more through that contempt\nfor concealment which characterizes the courageous type of large man,\nhe showed himself to her just as he was.  And she saw him not as an\nambition but as an appetite, or rather a bundle of appetites.\n\n\"He has no ideals,\" she thought.  \"He's like a man who wants food\nmerely for itself, not for the strength and the intellect it will build\nup.  And he likes or dislikes human beings only as one likes or\ndislikes different things to eat.\"\n\n\"It'll take you years and years,\" she said to him, because she must say\nsomething.\n\n\"Not at all.\"  He waved his hand--Olivia thought it looked as much like\na claw as like a hand.  \"It's a sky-scraper, but we build sky-scrapers\novernight.  Time and space used to be the big elements.  WE practically\ndisregard them.\"  He followed this with a self-satisfied laugh and an\nemptying of his champagne glass at a gulp.\n\nThe women were rising to withdraw.  After half an hour Langdon and\nHerron joined them.  Dumont and Fanshaw did not come until eleven\no'clock.  Then Dumont was so abrupt and surly that every one was\ngrateful to Mrs. Fanshaw for taking him away to the west veranda.  At\nmidnight all went to their rooms, Pauline going with Olivia, \"to make\nsure you haven't been neglected.\"\n\nShe lingered until after one, and when they kissed each the other good\nnight, she said:  \"It's done me a world of good to see you,\n'Livia--more even than I hoped.  I knew you'd be sympathetic with me\nwhere you understood.  Now, I feel that you're sympathetic where you\ndon't understand, too.  And it's there that one really needs sympathy.\"\n\n\"That's what friendship means--and--love,\" said Olivia.\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\"MY SISTER-IN-LAW, GLADYS.\"\n\nThe following afternoon Dumont took the Herrons, the Fanshaws and\nLangdon back to New York in his private car, and for three days Olivia\nand Pauline had the Eyrie to themselves.  Olivia was about to write to\nScarborough, asking him to call, when she saw in the News-Bulletin that\nhe had gone to Denver to speak.  A week after she left, Dumont\nreturned, bringing his sister Gladys, just arrived from Europe, and\nLangdon.  He stayed four days, took Langdon away with him and left\nGladys.\n\nThus it came about that Scarborough, riding into Colonel Gardiner's\ngrounds one hot afternoon in mid September, saw a phaeton-victoria with\ntwo women in it coming toward him on its way out.  He drew his horse\naside to make room.  He was conscious that there were two women; he saw\nonly one--she who was all in white except the scarlet poppies against\nthe brim of her big white hat.\n\nAs he bowed the carriage stopped and Pauline said cordially: \"Why, how\nd'ye do?\"\n\nHe drew his horse close to the carriage and they shook hands. She\nintroduced the other woman--\"My sister-in-law, Gladys Dumont\"--then\nwent on:  \"We've been lunching and spending the afternoon with father\nand mother.  They told us you returned this morning.\"\n\n\"I supposed you were in the East,\" said Scarborough--the first words he\nhad spoken.\n\n\"Oh--I'm living here now--Gladys and I.  Father says you never go\nanywhere, but I hope you'll make an exception for us.\"\n\n\"Thank you--I'll be glad to call.\"\n\n\"Why not dine with us--day after to-morrow night?\"\n\n\"I'd like that--certainly, I'll come.\"\n\n\"We dine at half-past eight--at least we're supposed to.\"\n\nScarborough lifted his hat.\n\nThe carriage drove on.\n\n\"Why, he's not a bit as I expected,\" Gladys began at once. \"He's much\nyounger.  ISN'T he handsome!  That's the way a MAN ought to look.  He's\nnot married?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Pauline.\n\n\"Why did you look so queer when you first caught sight of him?\"\n\n\"Did I?\" Pauline replied tranquilly.  \"Probably it was because he very\nsuddenly and vividly brought Battle Field back to me--that was the\nhappiest time of my life.  But I was too young or too foolish, or both,\nto know it till long afterward.  At seventeen one takes happiness for\ngranted.\"\n\n\"Did he look then as he does now?\"\n\n\"No--and yes,\" said Pauline.  \"He was just from the farm and dressed\nbadly and was awkward at times.  But--really he was the same person.  I\nguess it was the little change in him that startled me.\"  And she\nbecame absorbed in her thoughts.\n\n\"I hope you'll send him in to dinner with me,\" said Gladys, presently.\n\n\"What did you say?\" asked Pauline, absently.\n\n\"I was talking of Mr. Scarborough.  I asked if you wouldn't send him in\nto dinner with me--unless you want to discuss old times with him.\"\n\n\"Yes--certainly--if you wish.\"\n\nAnd Pauline gave Scarborough to Gladys and did her duty as hostess by\ntaking in the dullest man in the party--Newnham. While Newnham droned\nand prosed, she watched Gladys lay herself out to please the\ndistinguished Mr. Scarborough, successful as a lawyer, famous as an\norator, deferred to because of his influence with the rank and file of\nhis party in the middle West.\n\nGladys had blue-black hair which she wore pulled out into a sort of\nhalo about her small, delicate face.  There were points of light in her\ndark irises, giving them the look of black quartz in the sunshine.  She\nwas not tall, but her figure was perfect, and she had her dresses\nfitted immediately to it.  Her appeal was frankly to the senses, the\nedge taken from its audacity by its artistic effectiveness and by her\ningenuous, almost innocent, expression.\n\nSeeing Pauline looking at her, she tilted her head to a graceful angle\nand sent a radiant glance between two blossom-laden branches of the\ngreen and white bush that towered and spread in the center of the\ntable.  \"Mr. Scarborough says,\" she called out, \"character isn't a\ndevelopment, it's a disclosure.  He thinks one is born a certain kind\nof person and that one's life simply either gives it a chance to show\nor fails to give it a chance.  He says the boy isn't father to the man,\nbut the miniature of the man.  What do you think, Pauline?\"\n\n\"I haven't thought of it,\" replied Pauline.  \"But I'm certain it's\ntrue.  I used to dispute Mr. Scarborough's ideas sometimes, but I\nlearned better.\"\n\nAs she realized the implications of her careless remark, their eyes met\nsquarely for the first time since Battle Field.  Both hastily glanced\naway, and neither looked at the other again. When the men came up to\nthe drawing-room to join the women, Gladys adroitly intercepted him.\nWhen he went to Pauline to take leave, their manner each toward the\nother was formal, strained and even distant.\n\n\nDumont came again just after the November election.  It had been an\nunexpected victory for the party which Scarborough advocated, and\neverywhere the talk was that he had been the chief factor--his skill in\ndefining issues, his eloquence in presenting them, the public\nconfidence in his party through the dominance of a man so obviously\nfree from self-seeking or political trickery of any kind.  Dumont, to\nwhom control in both party machines and in the state government was a\nbusiness necessity, told his political agent, Merriweather, that they\nhad \"let Scarborough go about far enough,\" unless he could be brought\ninto their camp.\n\n\"I can't make out what he's looking for,\" said Merriweather. \"One\nthing's certain--he'll do US no good.  There's no way we can get our\nhooks in him.  He don't give a damn for money.  And as for power--he\ncan get more of that by fighting us than by falling in line.  We ain't\nexactly popular.\"\n\nThis seemed to Dumont rank ingratitude.  Had he not just divided a\nmillion dollars among charities and educational institutions in the\ndistricts where opposition to his \"merger\" was strongest?\n\n\"Well, we'll see,\" he said.  \"If he isn't careful we'll have to kill\nhim off in convention and make the committees stop his mouth.\"\n\n\"The trouble is he's been building up a following of his own--the sort\nof following that can't be honeyfugled,\" replied Merriweather.  \"The\ncommittees are afraid of him.\" Merriweather always took the gloomy view\nof everything, because he thus discounted his failures in advance and\ndoubled the effect of his successes.\n\n\"I'll see--I'll see,\" said Dumont, impatiently.  And he thought he was\nbeginning to \"see\" when Gladys expanded to him upon the subject of\nScarborough--his good looks, his wit, his \"distinction.\"\n\nScarborough came to dinner a few evenings later and Dumont was\nparticularly cordial to him; and Gladys made the most of the\nopportunity which Pauline again gave her.  That night, when the others\nhad left or had gone to bed, Gladys followed her brother into the\nsmoke-room adjoining the library.  They sat in silence drinking a\n\"night-cap.\"  In the dreaminess of her eyes, in the absent smile\ndrifting round the corners of her full red lips, Gladys showed that her\nthoughts were pleasant and sentimental.\n\n\"What do you think of Scarborough?\" her brother asked suddenly.\n\nShe started but did not flush--in her long European experience she had\ngained control of that signal of surprise.  \"How do you mean?\" she\nasked.  She rarely answered a question immediately, no matter how\nsimple it was, but usually put another question in reply.  Thus she\ninsured herself time to think if time should be necessary.\n\n\"I mean, do you like him?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly.  But I've seen him only a few times.\"\n\n\"He's an uncommon man,\" continued her brother.  \"He'd make a mighty\nsatisfactory husband for an ambitious woman, especially one with the\nmoney to push him fast.\"\n\nGladys slowly lifted and slowly lowered her smooth, slender shoulders.\n\n\"That sort of thing doesn't interest a woman in a man, unless she's\nmarried to him and has got over thinking more about him than about\nherself.\"\n\n\"It ought to,\" replied her brother.  \"A clever woman can always slosh\nround in sentimental slop with her head above it and cool.  If I were a\ngirl I'd make a dead set for that chap.\"\n\n\"If you were a girl,\" said Gladys, \"you'd do nothing of the sort.\nYou'd compel him to make a dead set for you.\"  And as she put down her\nglass she gave his hair an affectionate pull--which was her way of\nthanking him for saying what she most wished to hear on the subject she\nmost wished to hear about.\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\nSTRAINING AT THE ANCHORS.\n\nGladys was now twenty-four and was even more anxious to marry than is\nthe average unmarried person.  She had been eleven years a wanderer;\nshe was tired of it.  She had no home; and she wanted a home.\n\nHer aunt--her mother's widowed sister--had taken her abroad when she\nwas thirteen.  John was able to defy or to deceive their mother.  But\nshe could and did enforce upon Gladys the rigid rules which her\nfanatical nature had evolved--a minute and crushing tyranny.  Therefore\nGladys preferred any place to her home.  For ten years she had been\nroaming western Europe, nominally watched by her lazy, selfish, and\nphysically and mentally near-sighted aunt.  Actually her only guardian\nhad been her own precocious, curiously prudent, curiously reckless\nself. She had been free to do as she pleased; and she had pleased to do\nvery free indeed.  She had learned all that her intense and catholic\ncuriosity craved to know, had learned it of masters of her own\nselecting--the men and women who would naturally attract a lively young\nperson, eager to rejoice in an escape from slavery.  Her eyes had\npeered far into the human heart, farthest into the corrupted human\nheart; yet, with her innocence she had not lost her honesty or her\npreference for the things she had been brought up to think clean.\n\nBut she had at last wearied of a novelty which lay only in changes of\nscene and of names, without any important change in characters or plot.\nShe began to be bored with the game of baffling the hopes inspired by\nher beauty and encouraged by her seeming simplicity.  And when her\nmother came--as she said to Pauline, \"The only bearable view of mother\nis a distant view.  I had forgot there were such people left on\nearth--I had thought they'd all gone to their own kind of heaven.\"  So\nshe fled to America, to her brother and his wife.\n\nDumont stayed eight days at the Eyrie on that trip, then went back to\nhis congenial life in New York--to his business and his dissipation.\nHe tempered his indulgence in both nowadays with some exercise--his\nstomach, his heart, his nerves and his doctor had together given him a\nbad fright.  The evening before he left he saw Pauline and Gladys\nsitting apart and joined them.\n\n\"Why not invite Scarborough to spend a week up here?\" he asked, just\nglancing at his wife.  He never ventured to look at her when there was\nany danger of their eyes meeting.\n\nHer lips tightened and the color swiftly left her cheeks and swiftly\nreturned.\n\n\"Wouldn't you like it, Gladys?\" he went on.\n\n\"Oh, DO ask him, Pauline,\" said Gladys, with enthusiasm.  Like her\nbrother, she always went straight to the point--she was in the habit of\ndeciding for herself, of thinking what she did was above criticism, and\nof not especially caring if it was criticised.  \"Please do!\"\n\nPauline waited long--it seemed to her long enough for time to wrinkle\nher heart--before answering:  \"We'll need another man. I'll ask him--if\nyou wish.\"\n\nGladys pressed her hand gratefully--she was fond of Pauline, and\nPauline was liking her again as she had when they were children and\nplaymates and partners in the woes of John Dumont's raids upon their\ngames.  Just then Langdon's sister, Mrs. Barrow, called Gladys to the\nother end of the drawing-room.  Dumont's glance followed her.\n\n\"I think it'd be a good match,\" he said reflectively.\n\nPauline's heart missed a beat and a suffocating choke contracted her\nthroat.\n\n\"What?\" she succeeded in saying.\n\n\"Gladys and Scarborough,\" replied Dumont. \"She ought to marry--she's\ngot no place to go.  And it'd be good business for her--and for him,\ntoo, for that matter, if she could land him. Don't you think she's\nattractive to men?\"\n\n\"Very,\" said Pauline, lifelessly.\n\n\"Don't you think it would be a good match?\" he went on.\n\n\"Very,\" she said, looking round wildly, as her breath came more and\nmore quickly.\n\nLangdon strolled up.\n\n\"Am I interrupting a family council?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Dumont replied, rising.  \"Take my chair.\"  And he was gone.\n\n\"This room is too warm,\" said Pauline.  \"No, don't open the window.\nExcuse me a moment.\"  She went into the hall, threw a golf cape round\nher shoulders and stepped out on the veranda, closing the door-window\nbehind her.  It was a moonless, winter night--stars thronging the\nblue-black sky; the steady lamp of a planet set in the southern horizon.\n\nWhen she had been walking there for a quarter of an hour the\ndoor-window opened and Langdon looked out.  \"Oh--there you are!\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Won't you join me?\"  Her tone assured him that he would not be\nintruding.  He got a hat and overcoat and they walked up and down\ntogether.\n\n\"Those stars irritate me,\" he said after a while.  \"They make me\nappreciate that this world's a tiny grain of sand adrift in infinity,\nand that I'm----there's nothing little enough to express the human atom\nwhere the earth's only a grain.  And then they go on to taunt me with\nhow short-lived I am and how it'll soon be all over for me--for ever.\nA futile little insect, buzzing about, waiting to be crushed under the\nheel of the Great Executioner.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I feel that,\" answered Pauline.  \"But again--often, as a\nchild--and since, when everything has looked dark and ugly for me, I've\ngone where I could see them.  And they seemed to draw all the fever and\nthe fear out of me, and to put there instead a sort of--not happiness,\nnot even content, but--courage.\"\n\nThey were near the rail now, she gazing into the southern sky, he\nstudying her face.  It seemed to him that he had not seen any one so\nbeautiful.  She was all in black with a diamond star glittering in her\nhair high above her forehead.  She looked like a splendid plume dropped\nfrom the starry wing of night.\n\n\"The stars make you feel that way,\" he said, in the light tone that\ndisguises a compliment as a bit of raillery, \"because you're of their\nfamily.  And I feel as I do because I'm a blood-relation of the\nearthworms.\"\n\nHer face changed.  \"Oh, but so am I!\" she exclaimed, with a passion he\nhad never seen or suspected in her before.  She drew a long breath,\nclosed her eyes and opened them very wide.\n\n\"You don't know, you can't imagine, how I long to LIVE!  And KNOW what\n'to live' means.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you?\" he asked--he liked to catch people in their\nconfidential moods and to peer into the hidden places in their hearts,\nnot impudently but with a sort of scientific curiosity.\n\n\"Because I'm a daughter--that's anchor number one.  Because I'm a\nmother--that's anchor number two.  Because I'm a wife--that's anchor\nnumber three.  And anchor number four--because I'm under the spell of\ninherited instincts that rule me though I don't in the least believe in\nthem.  Tied, hands and feet!\"\n\n\"Inherited instinct.\"  He shook his head sadly.  \"That's the skeleton\nat life's banquet.  It takes away my appetite.\"\n\nShe laughed without mirth, then sighed with some self-mockery. \"It\nfrightens ME away from the table.\"\n\n\n\nXV.\n\nGRADUATED PEARLS.\n\nBut Scarborough declined her invitation.  However, he did come to\ndinner ten days later; and Gladys, who had no lack of confidence in her\npower to charm when and whom she chose, was elated by his friendliness\nthen and when she met him at other houses.\n\n\"He's not a bit sentimental,\" she told Pauline, whose silence whenever\nshe tried to discuss him did not discourage her.  \"But if he ever does\ncare for a woman he'll care in the same tremendous way that he sweeps\nthings before him in his career. Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pauline.\n\nShe had now lingered at Saint X two months beyond the time she\noriginally set.  She told herself she had reached the limit of\nendurance, that she must fly from the spectacle of Gladys' growing\nintimacy with Scarborough; she told Gladys it was impossible for her\nlonger to neglect the new house in Fifth Avenue.  With an effort she\nadded:  \"You'd rather stay on here, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"I detest New York,\" replied Gladys.  \"And I've never enjoyed myself in\nmy whole life as I'm enjoying it here.\"\n\nSo she went East alone, went direct to Dawn Hill, their country place\nat Manhasset, Long Island, which Dumont never visited.  She invited\nLeonora Fanshaw down to stand between her thoughts and herself.  Only\nthe society of a human being, one who was light-hearted and amusing,\ncould tide her back to any sort of peace in the old life--her books and\nher dogs, her horseback and her drawing and her gardening.  A life so\nfull of events, so empty of event.  It left her hardly time for proper\nsleep, yet it had not a single one of those vivid threads of intense\nand continuous interest--and one of them is enough to make bright the\ndullest pattern that issues from the Loom.\n\nIn her \"splendor\" her nearest approach to an intimacy had been with\nLeonora.\n\nShe had no illusions about the company she was keeping in the East.  To\nher these \"friends\" seemed in no proper sense either her friends or one\nanother's.  Drawn together from all parts of America, indeed of the\nworld, by the magnetism of millions, they had known one another not at\nall or only slightly in the period of life when thorough friendships\nare made; even where they had been associates as children, the\nassociation had rarely been of the kind that creates friendship's\ndemocratic intimacy.  They had no common traditions, no real\nclass-feeling, no common enthusiasms--unless the passion for keeping\nrich, for getting richer, for enjoying and displaying riches, could be\ncalled enthusiasm.  They were mere intimate acquaintances, making small\npretense of friendship, having small conception of it or desire for it\nbeyond that surface politeness which enables people whose selfish\ninterests lie in the same direction to get on comfortably together.\n\nShe divided them into two classes.  There were those who, like herself,\nkept up great establishments and entertained lavishly and engaged in\nthe courteous but fierce rivalry of fashionable ostentation.  Then\nthere were those who hung about the courts of the rich, invited because\nthey filled in the large backgrounds and contributed conversation or\nideas for new amusements, accepting because they loved the atmosphere\nof luxury which they could not afford to create for themselves.\n\nLeonora was undeniably in the latter class.  But she was associated in\nPauline's mind with the period before her splendor. She had been\nfriendly when Dumont was unknown beyond Saint X. The others sought\nher--well, for the same reasons of desire for distraction and dread of\nboredom which made her welcome them. But Leonora, she more than half\nbelieved, liked her to a certain extent for herself--\"likes me better\nthan I like her.\"  And at times she was self-reproachful for being thus\nexceeded in self-giving.  Leonora, for example, told her her most\nintimate secrets, some of them far from creditable to her.  Pauline\ntold nothing in return.  She sometimes longed for a confidant, or,\nrather, for some person who would understand without being told, some\none like Olivia; but her imagination refused to picture Leonora as that\nkind of friend.  Even more pronounced than her frankness, and she was\nfrank to her own hurt, was her biting cynicism--it was undeniably\namusing; it did not exactly inspire distrust, but it put Pauline\nvaguely on guard.  Also, she was candidly mercenary, and, in some\nmoods, rapaciously envious. \"But no worse,\" thought Pauline, \"than so\nmany of the others here, once one gets below their surface.  Besides,\nit's in a good-natured, good-hearted way.\"\n\nShe wished Fanshaw were as rich as Leonora longed for him to be. She\nwas glad Dumont seemed to be putting him in the way of making a\nfortune.  He was distasteful to her, because she saw that he was an\nill-tempered sycophant under a pretense of manliness thick enough to\nshield him from the unobservant eyes of a world of men and women greedy\nof flattery and busy each with himself or herself.  But for Leonora's\nsake she invited him.  And Leonora was appreciative, was witty, never\nmonotonous or commonplace, most helpful in getting up entertainments,\nand good to look at--always beautifully dressed and as fresh as if just\nfrom a bath; sparkling green eyes, usually with good-humored mockery in\nthem; hard, smooth, glistening shoulders and arms; lips a crimson line,\nat once cold and sensuous.\n\nOn a Friday in December Pauline came up from Dawn Hill and, after two\nhours at the new house, went to the jeweler's to buy a wedding present\nfor Aurora Galloway.  As she was passing the counter where the\nsuperintendent had his office, his assistant said:  \"Beg pardon, Mrs.\nDumont.  The necklace came in this morning.  Would you like to look at\nit?\"\n\nShe paused, not clearly hearing him.  He took a box from the safe\nbehind him and lifted from it a magnificent necklace of graduated\npearls with a huge solitaire diamond clasp.  \"It's one of the finest we\never got together,\" he went on.  \"But you can see for yourself.\"  He\nwas flushing in the excitement of his eagerness to ingratiate himself\nwith such a distinguished customer.\n\n\"Beautiful!\" said Pauline, taking the necklace as he held it out to\nher.  \"May I ask whom it's for?\"\n\nThe clerk looked puzzled, then frightened, as the implications of her\nobvious ignorance dawned upon him.\n\n\"Oh--I--I----\"  He almost snatched it from her, dropped it into the\nbox, put on the lid.  And he stood with mouth ajar and forehead beaded.\n\n\"Please give it to me again,\" said Pauline, coldly.  \"I had not\nfinished looking at it.\"\n\nHis uneasy eyes spied the superintendent approaching.  He grew scarlet,\nthen white, and in an agony of terror blurted out: \"Here comes the\nsuperintendent.  I beg you, Mrs. Dumont, don't tell him I showed it to\nyou.  I've made some sort of a mistake. You'll ruin me if you speak of\nit to any one.  I never thought it might be intended as a surprise to\nyou.  Indeed, I wasn't supposed to know anything about it.  Maybe I was\nmistaken----\"\n\nHis look and voice were so pitiful that Pauline replied reassuringly:\n\"I understand--I'll say nothing.  Please show me those,\" and she\npointed to a tray of unset rubies in the show-case.\n\nAnd when the superintendent, bowing obsequiously, came up himself to\ntake charge of this important customer, she was deep in the rubies\nwhich the assistant was showing her with hands that shook and fingers\nthat blundered.\n\nShe did not permit her feelings to appear until she was in her carriage\nagain and secure from observation.  The clerk's theory she could not\nentertain for an instant, contradicted as it was by the facts of eight\nyears.  She knew she had surprised Dumont. She had learned nothing new;\nbut it forced her to stare straight into the face of that which she had\nbeen ignoring, that which she must continue to ignore if she was to\nmeet the ever heavier and crueler exactions of the debt she had\nincurred when she betrayed her father and mother and herself.  At a\ntime when her mind was filled with bitter contrasts between what was\nand what might have been, it brought bluntly to her the precise kind of\nlife she was leading, the precise kind of surroundings she was\ntolerating.\n\n\"Whom can he be giving such a gift?\" she wondered.  And she had an\nimpulse to confide in Leonora to the extent of encouraging her to hint\nwho it was.  \"She would certainly know.  No doubt everybody knows,\nexcept me.\"\n\nShe called for her, as she had promised, and took her to lunch at\nSherry's.  But the impulse to confide died as Leonora talked--of money,\nof ways of spending money; of people who had money, and those who\nhadn't money; of people who were spending too much money, of those who\nweren't spending enough money; of what she would do if she had money,\nof what many did to get money.  Money, money, money--it was all of the\nweb and most of the woof of her talk.  Now it ran boldly on the surface\nof the pattern; now it was half hid under something about art or books\nor plays or schemes for patronizing the poor and undermining their\nself-respect--but it was always there.\n\nFor the first time Leonora jarred upon her fiercely--unendurably. She\nlistened until the sound grew indistinct, became mingled with the\nchatter of that money-flaunting throng.  And presently the chatter\nseemed to her to be a maddening repetition of one word, money--the\ncentral idea in all the thought and all the action of these people.  \"I\nmust get away,\" she thought, \"or I shall cry out.\"  And she left\nabruptly, alleging that she must hurry to catch her train.\n\nMoney-mad! her thoughts ran on.  The only test of honor--money, and\nability and willingness to spend it.  They must have money or they're\nnobodies.  And if they have money, who cares where it came from?  No\none asks where the men get it--why should any one ask where the women\nget it?\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\nCHOICE AMONG EVILS.\n\nA few days afterward--it was a Wednesday--Pauline came up to town early\nin the afternoon, as she had an appointment with the dressmaker and was\ngoing to the opera in the evening.  At the dressmaker's, while she\nwaited for a fitter to return from the workroom, she glanced at a\nnewspaper spread upon the table so that its entire front page was in\nview.  It was filled with an account of how the Woolens Monopoly had,\nin that bitter winter, advanced prices twenty to thirty-five per cent.\nall along the line.  From the center of the page stared a picture of\nJohn Dumont--its expression peculiarly arrogant and sinister.\n\nShe read the head-lines only, then turned from the table.  But on the\ndrive up-town she stopped the carriage at the Savoy and sent the\nfootman to the news-stand to get the paper.  She read the article\nthrough--parts of it several times.\n\nShe had Langdon and Honoria Longview at dinner that night; by indirect\nquestioning she drew him on to confirm the article, to describe how the\nWoolens Monopoly was \"giving the country an old-fashioned winter.\"  On\nthe way to the opera she was ashamed of her ermine wrap enfolding her\nfrom the slightest sense of the icy air.  She did not hear the singers,\nwas hardly conscious of her surroundings.  As they left the\nMetropolitan she threw back her wrap and sat with her neck bared to the\nintense cold.\n\n\"I say, don't do that!\" protested Langdon.\n\nShe reluctantly drew the fur about her.  But when she had dropped him\nand then Honoria and was driving on up the avenue alone, she bared her\nshoulders and arms again--\"like a silly child,\" she said.  But it gave\nher a certain satisfaction, for she felt like one who has a secret\nstore of food in time of famine and feasts upon it.  And she sat\nunprotected.\n\n\"Is Mr. Dumont in?\" she asked the butler as he closed the door of their\npalace behind her.\n\n\"I think he is, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Please tell him I'd like to see him--in the library.\"\n\nShe had to wait only three or four minutes before he came--in smoking\njacket and slippers.  It was long since she had looked at him so\ncarefully as she did then; and she noted how much grosser he was, the\npuffs under his eyes, the lines of cruelty that were coming out\nstrongly with autocratic power and the custom of receiving meek\nobedience.  And her heart sank.  \"Useless,\" she said to herself.\n\"Utterly useless!\"  And the incident of the necklace and its reminders\nof all she had suffered from him and through him came trooping into her\nmind; and it seemed to her that she could not speak, could not even\nremain in the room with him.\n\nHe dropped into a chair before the open fire.  \"Horribly cold, isn't\nit?\"\n\nShe moved uneasily.  He slowly lighted a cigar and began to smoke it,\nhis attitude one of waiting.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" she began at last--she was looking reflectively\ninto the fire--\"about your great talent for business and finance.  You\nformed your big combination, and because you understand everything\nabout wool you employ more men, you pay higher wages, and you make the\ngoods better than ever, and at less cost.\"\n\n\"Between a third and a half cheaper,\" he said.  \"We employ thirty\nthousand more men, and since we settled the last strike\"--a grim smile\nthat would have meant a great deal to her had she known the history of\nthat strike and how hard he had fought before he gave in--\"we've paid\nthirty per cent. higher wages.  Yet the profits are--well, you can\nimagine.\"\n\n\"And you've made millions for yourself and for those in with you.\"\n\n\"I haven't developed my ideas for nothing.\"\n\nShe paused again.  It was several minutes before she went on:\n\n\"When a doctor or a man of science or a philosopher makes a discovery\nthat'll be a benefit to the world\"--she looked at him suddenly,\nearnest, appealing--\"he gives it freely.  And he gets honor and fame.\nWhy shouldn't you do that, John?\"  She had forgotten herself in her\nsubject.\n\nHe smiled into the fire--hardly a day passed that he did not have\npresented to him some scheme for relieving him of the burden of his\nriches; here was another, and from such an unexpected quarter!\n\n\"You could be rich, too.  We spend twenty, fifty times as much as we\ncan possibly enjoy; and you have more than we could possibly spend.\nWhy shouldn't a man with financial genius be like men with other kinds\nof genius?  Why should he be the only one to stay down on the level\nwith dull, money-grubbing, sordid kinds of people?  Why shouldn't he\nhave ideals?\"\n\nHe made no reply.  Indeed, so earnest was she that she did not give him\ntime, but immediately went on:\n\n\"Just think, John!  Instead of giving out in these charities and\nphilanthropies--I never did believe in them--they're bound to be more\nor less degrading to the people that take, and when it's so hard to\nhelp a friend with money without harming him, how much harder it must\nbe to help strangers.  Instead of those things, why not be really\ngreat?  Just think, John, how the world would honor you and how you\nwould feel, if you used your genius to make the necessaries cheap for\nall these fellow-beings of ours who have such a hard time getting on.\nThat would be real superiority--and our life now is so vain, so empty.\nIt's brutal, John.\"\n\n\"What do you propose?\" he asked, curious as always when a new idea was\npresented to him.  And this was certainly new--apparently, philanthropy\nwithout expense.\n\n\"You are master.  You can do as you please.  Why not put your great\ncombine on such a basis that it would bring an honest, just return to\nyou and the others, and would pay the highest possible wages, and would\ngive the people the benefit of what your genius for manufacturing and\nfor finance has made possible?  I think we who are so comfortable and\nnever have to think of the necessaries of life forget how much a few\ncents here and there mean to most people.  And the things you control\nmean all the difference between warmth and cold, between life and\ndeath, John!\"\n\nAs she talked he settled back into his chair, and his face hardened\ninto its unyielding expression.  A preposterous project! Just like a\ngood, sentimental woman.  Not philanthropy without expense, but\nphilanthropy at the expense both, of his fortune and of his position as\na master.  To use his brain and his life for those ungrateful people\nwho derided his benefactions as either contributions to \"the conscience\nfund\" or as indirect attempts at public bribery!  He could not conceal\nhis impatience--though he did not venture to put it into words.\n\n\"If we--if you and I, John,\" she hurried on, leaning toward him in her\nearnestness, \"had something like that to live for, it might come to be\nvery different with us--and--I'm thinking of Gardiner most of all.\nThis'll ruin him some day.  No one, NO ONE, can lead this kind of life\nwithout being dragged down, without becoming selfish and sordid and\ncruel.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" he said curtly, without looking at her. \"I\nnever heard of such--such sentimentalism.\"\n\nShe winced and was silent, sat watching his bold, strong profile.\nPresently she said in a changed, strange, strained voice:  \"What I\nasked to see you for was--John, won't you put the prices--at least\nwhere they were at the beginning of this dreadful winter?\"\n\n\"Oh--I see!\" he exclaimed.  \"You've been listening to the lies about\nme.\"\n\n\"READING,\" she said, her eyes flashing at the insult in the accusation\nthat she had let people attack him to her.\n\n\"Well, reading then,\" he went on, wondering what he had said that\nangered her.  And he made an elaborate explanation--about \"the\nnecessity of meeting fixed charges\" which he himself had fixed, about\n\"fair share of prosperity,\" \"everything more expensive,\" \"the country\nbetter able to pay,\" \"every one doing as we are,\" and so on.\n\nShe listened closely; she had not come ignorant of the subject, and she\npenetrated his sophistries.  When he saw her expression, saw he had\nfailed to convince her, into, his eyes came the look she understood\nwell--the look that told her she would only infuriate him and bruise\nherself by flinging herself against the iron of his resolve.\n\n\"You must let me attend to my own business,\" he ended, his tone\ngood-natured, his eyes hard.\n\nShe sat staring into the fire for several minutes--from her eyes looked\na will as strong as his.  Then she rose and, her voice lower than\nbefore but vibrating, said:  \"All round us--here in New York--all over\nthis country--away off in Europe--I can see them--I can feel\nthem--SUFFERING!  As you yourself said, it's HORRIBLY cold!\"  She drew\nherself up and faced him, a light in her eyes before which he visibly\nshrank.  \"Yes, it's YOUR business.  But it shan't be mine or MY boy's!\"\n\nAnd she left the room.  In the morning she returned to Dawn Hill and\narranged her affairs so that she would be free to go.  Not since the\nspring day, nearly nine years before, when she began that Vergil lesson\nwhich ended in a lesson in the pitilessness of consequences that was\nnot yet finished, had her heart been so light, so hopeful.  In vain she\nreminded herself that the doing of this larger duty, so imperative,\nnevertheless endangered her father and mother.  \"They will be proud\nthat I'm doing it,\" she assured herself.\n\n\"For Gardiner's sake, as well as for mine, they'll be glad I separated\nhim and myself from this debased life.  They will--they MUST, since it\nis right!\"  And already she felt the easing of the bonds that had never\nfailed to cut deeper into the living flesh whenever she had ventured to\nhope that she was at last growing used to them.\n\n\"Free!\" she said to herself exultantly.  She dared to exult, but she\ndid not dare to express to herself the hopes, the wild, incredible\nhopes, which the very thought of freedom set to quivering deep down in\nher, as the first warmth makes the life toss in its slumber in the\nplanted seed.\n\nOn Friday she came up to New York late in the afternoon, and in the\nevening went to the opera--for a last look round.  As the lights were\nlowering for the rise of the curtain on the second act, Leonora and her\nhusband entered the box.  She had forgotten inviting them.  She gave\nLeonora the chair in front and took the one behind--Millicent Rowland,\nwhom she herself brought, had the other front seat.  As her chair was\nmidway between the two, she was seeing across Leonora's shoulders.\nPresently Dumont came in and took the chair behind Leonora's and leaned\nforward, his chin almost touching the slope of her neck as he talked to\nher in an undertone, she greatly amused or pretending to be.\n\nThe light from the stage fell across Leonora's bosom, fell upon a\nmagnificent string of graduated pearls clasped with a huge solitaire\nbeyond question the string the jeweler's clerk had blunderingly shown\nher.  And there was Dumont's heavy, coarse profile outlined against\nLeonora's cheek and throat, her cynical, sensuous profile showing just\nbeyond.\n\nOpen sprang a hundred doors of memory; into Pauline's mind was\ndischarged avalanche after avalanche of dreadful thoughts.  \"No! No!\"\nshe protested.  \"How infamous to think such things of my best friend!\"\nBut she tried in vain to thrust suspicions, accusations, proofs, back\ninto the closets.  Instead, she sank under the flood of them--sick and\ncertain.\n\nWhen the lights went up she said:  \"I'm feeling badly all at once.  I'm\nafraid I'll have to take you home, Milly.\"\n\n\"Are you ill, dear?\" asked Leonora.\n\n\"Oh, no--just faint,\" she replied, in a voice which she succeeded in\nmaking fairly natural.\n\n\"Please don't move.  Stay on--you really must.\"\n\nThe other man--Shenstone--helped her and Millicent with their wraps and\naccompanied them to their carriage.  When she had set Millicent down\nshe drew a long breath of relief.  For the first time in seven years\nher course lay straight before her.  \"I must be free!\" she said.  \"I\nmust be ENTIRELY free--free before the whole world--I and my boy.\"\n\n\nThe next morning, in the midst of her preparations to take the\nten-o'clock limited for the West, her maid brought a note to her--a\ncopy of a National Woolens Company circular to the trade, setting forth\nthat \"owing to a gratifying easing in the prices for raw wool, the\nCompany are able to announce and take great pleasure in announcing a\nten per cent. reduction.\"  On the margin Dumont had scrawled \"To go out\nto-morrow and to be followed in ten days by fifteen per cent. more.\nCouldn't resist your appeal.\"  Thus by the sheer luck that had so often\nsupplemented his skill and mitigated his mistakes, he had yielded to\nher plea just in time to confuse the issue between her and him.\n\nShe read the circular and the scrawl with a sinking heart.\n\"Nevertheless, I shall go!\" she tried to protest.  \"True, he won't send\nout this circular if I do.  But what does it matter, one infamy more or\nless in him?  Besides, he will accomplish his purpose in some other way\nof which I shall not know.\"  But this was only the beginning of the\nbattle.  Punishment on punishment for an act which seemed right at the\ntime had made her morbid, distrustful of herself.  And she could not\nconquer the dread lest her longing to be free was blinding her, was\nluring her on to fresh calamities, involving all whom she cared for,\nall who cared for her.  Whichever way she looked she could see only a\nchoice between wrongs.  To stay under the same roof with him or at Dawn\nHill--self-respect put that out of the question.  To free herself--how\ncould she, when it meant sacrificing her parents and also the thousands\nshivering under the extortions of his monopoly?\n\nIn the end she chose the course that seemed to combine the least evil\nwith the most good.  She would go to the Eyrie, and the world and her\nfather and mother would think she was absenting herself from her\nhusband to attend to the bringing up of her boy. She would see even\nless of Scarborough than she saw when she was last at Saint X.\n\nThat afternoon she wrote to Dumont:\n\n\nSince we had our talk I have found out about Leonora.  It is impossible\nfor me to stay here.  I shall go West to-morrow.  But I shall not go to\nmy father's; because of your circular I shall go to the Eyrie,\ninstead--at least for the present.\n\n                     PAULINE DUMONT.\n\n\nTwo weeks after she was again settled at the Eyrie, Langdon appeared in\nSaint X, alleging business at the National Woolens' factories there.\nHe accepted her invitation to stay with her, and devoted himself to\nGladys, who took up her flirtation with him precisely where she had\ndropped it when they bade each the other a mock-mournful good-by five\nmonths before.  They were so realistic that Pauline came to the\nsatisfying conclusion that her sister-in-law was either in earnest with\nLangdon or not in earnest with anybody.  If she had not been avoiding\nScarborough, she would probably have seen Gladys' real game--to use\nLangdon as a stalking horse for him.\n\n\"No doubt Scarborough, like all men, imagines he's above jealousy,\"\nGladys had said to herself, casting her keen eyes over the situation.\n\"But there never was a man who didn't race better with a pace-maker\nthan on an empty track.\"\n\nToward the end of Langdon's first week Pauline's suspicions as to one\nof the objects of his winter trip West were confirmed by his saying\nquite casually:  \"Dumont's dropped Fanshaw, and Leonora's talking of\nthe stage.  In fact, she's gone abroad to study.\"\n\nWhen he was leaving, after nearly three weeks, he asked her when she\nwas coming back East.\n\n\"Never--I hope,\" she said, her fingers playing with the close-cropped\ncurls of her boy standing beside her.\n\n\"I fancied so--I fancied so,\" replied Langdon, his eyes showing that he\nunderstood her and that he knew she understood for whom he had asked.\n\n\"You are going to stay on--at the Eyrie?\"\n\n\"I think so, unless something--disquieting--occurs.  I've not made up\nmy mind.  Fate plays such queer tricks that I've stopped guessing at\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"What was it Miss Dumont's friend, Scarborough, quoted from Spinoza at\nAtwater's the other night?  'If a stone, on its way from the sling\nthrough the air, could speak, it would say, \"How free I am!'\"  Is that\nthe way you feel?\"\n\nThere came into Pauline's eyes a look of pain so intense that he\nglanced away.\n\n\"We choose a path blindfold,\" she said, her tone as light as her look\nwas dark, \"and we must go where it goes--there's no other ever\nafterward.\"\n\n\"But if it leads down?\"\n\n\"All the PATHS lead up,\" she replied with a sad smile.  \"It's the\nprecipices that lead down.\"\n\nGladys joined them and Langdon said to her:\n\n\"Well, good-by, Miss Dumont--don't get married till you see me.\"  He\npatted the boy on the shoulder.  \"Good-by, Gardiner--remember, we men\nmust always be brave, and gentle with the ladies.  Good-by, Mrs.\nDumont--keep away from the precipices. And if you should want to come\nback to us you'll have no trouble in finding us.  We're a lot of slow\nold rotters, and we'll be just where you left us--yawning, and shying\nat new people and at all new ideas except about clothes, and gossiping\nabout each other.\"  And he was in the auto and off for the station.\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nTWO AND THE BARRIER.\n\nScarborough often rode with Gladys and Pauline, sometimes with Gladys\nalone.  One afternoon in August he came expecting to go out with both.\nBut Gladys was not well that day.  She had examined her pale face and\ndeeply circled eyes in her glass; she had counseled with her maid--a\ndiscreetly and soothingly frank French woman.  Too late to telephone\nhim, she had overruled her longing to see him and had decided that at\nwhat she hoped was his \"critical stage\" it would be wiser not to show\nherself to him thus even in her most becoming tea-gown, which compelled\nthe eyes of the beholder to a fascinating game of hide and seek with\nher neck and arms and the lines of her figure.\n\n\"And Mrs. Dumont?\" inquired Scarborough of the servant who brought\nGladys' message and note.\n\n\"She's out walking, sir.\"\n\nScarborough rode away, taking the long drive through the grounds of the\nEyrie, as it would save him a mile of dusty and not well-shaded\nhighway.  A few hundred yards and he was passing the sloping meadows\nthat lay golden bronze in the sun, beyond the narrow fringe of wood\nskirting and shielding the drive.  The grass and clover had been cut.\nPart of it was spread where it had fallen, part had been raked into\nlittle hillocks ready for the wagons.  At the edge of one of these\nhillocks far down the slope he saw the tail of a pale blue skirt, a\nwhite parasol cast upon the stubble beside it.  He reined in his horse,\nhesitated, dismounted, tied his bridle round a sapling.  He strode\nacross the field toward the hillock that had betrayed its secret to him.\n\n\"Do I interrupt?\" he called when he was still far enough away not to be\ntaking her by surprise.\n\nThere was no answer.  He paused, debating whether to call again or to\nturn back.\n\nBut soon she was rising--the lower part of her tall narrow figure hid\nby the hillock, the upper part revealing to him the strong stamp of\nthat vivid individuality of hers which separated her at once from no\nmatter what company.  She had on a big garden hat, trimmed just a\nlittle with summer flowers, a blouse of some soft white material, with\neven softer lace on the shoulders and in the long, loose sleeves.  She\ngave a friendly nod and glance in his direction, and said:  \"Oh,\nno--not at all.  I'm glad to have help in enjoying this.\"\n\nShe was looking out toward the mists of the horizon hills.  The heat of\nthe day had passed; the woods, the hillocks of hay were casting long\nshadows on the pale-bronze fields.  A breeze had sprung up and was\nlifting from the dried and drying grass and clover a keen, sweet,\nintoxicating perfume--like the odor which classic zephyrs used to shake\nfrom the flowing hair of woodland nymphs.\n\nHe stood beside her without speaking, looking intently at her. It was\nthe first time he had been alone with her since the afternoon at Battle\nField when she confessed her marriage and he his love.\n\n\"Bandit was lame,\" she said when it seemed necessary to say something.\n\nShe rode a thoroughbred, Bandit, who would let no one else mount him;\nwhenever she got a new saddle she herself had to help put it on, so\nalert was he for schemes to entrap him to some other's service.  He\nobeyed her in the haughty, nervous way characteristic of\nthoroughbreds--obeyed because he felt that she was without fear, and\nbecause she had the firm but gentle hand that does not fret a horse yet\ndoes not let him think for an instant that he is or can be free.  Then,\ntoo, he had his share of the universal, fundamental vanity we should\nprobably find swelling the oyster did we but know how to interpret it;\nand he must have appreciated what an altogether harmonious spectacle it\nwas when he swept along with his mistress upon his back as light and\nfree as a Valkyr.\n\n\"I was sorry to miss the ride,\" Pauline went on after another pause--to\nher, riding was the keenest of the many physical delights that are for\nthose who have vigorous and courageous bodies and sensitive nerves.\nWhenever it was possible she fought out her battles with herself on\nhorseback, usually finding herself able there to drown mental distress\nin the surge of physical exultation.\n\nAs he still did not speak she looked at him--and could not look away.\nShe had not seen that expression since their final hour together at\nBattle Field, though in these few last months she had been remembering\nit so exactly, had been wondering, doubting whether she could not bring\nit to his face again, had been forbidding herself to long to see it.\nAnd there it was, unchanged like all the inflexible purposes that made\nhis character and his career.  And back to her came, as it had come\nmany and many a time in those years, the story he had told her of his\nfather and mother, of his father's love for his mother--how it had\nenfolded her from the harshness and peril of pioneer life, had enfolded\nher in age no less than in youth, had gone down into and through the\nValley of the Shadow with her, had not left her even at the gates of\nDeath, but had taken him on with her into the Beyond.  And Pauline\ntrembled, an enormous joy thrilling through and through her.\n\n\"Don't!\" she said uncertainly.  \"Don't look at me like that, PLEASE!\"\n\n\"You were crying,\" he said abruptly.  He stood before her, obviously\none who had conquered the respect of the world in fair, open battle,\nand has the courage that is for those only who have tested their\nstrength and know it will not fail them.  And the sight of him, the\nlook of him, filled her not with the mere belief, but with the absolute\nconviction that no malign power in all the world or in the mystery\nround the world could come past him to her to harass or harm her.  The\ndoubts, the sense of desolation that had so agitated her a few minutes\nbefore now seemed trivial, weak, unworthy.\n\nShe lowered her eyes--she had thought he would not observe the slight\ntraces of the tears she had carefully wiped away.  She clasped her\nhands meekly and looked--and felt--like a guilty child.  The coldness,\nthe haughtiness were gone from her face.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said shyly.  \"Yes--I--I--\"  She lifted her eyes--her tears\nhad made them as soft and luminous as the eyes of a child just awake\nfrom a long, untroubled sleep.  \"But--you must not ask me.  It's\nnothing that can be helped.  Besides, it seems nothing--now.\"  She\nforced a faint smile.  \"If you knew what a comfort it is to cry you'd\ntry it.\"\n\n\"I have,\" he replied.  Then after a pause he added:  \"Once.\" Something\nin his tone--she did not venture to look at him again--made her catch\nher breath.  She instantly and instinctively knew when that \"once\" was.\n\"I don't care to try it again, thank you,\" he went on.  \"But it made me\nable to understand what sort of comfort you were getting.  For--YOU\ndon't cry easily.\"\n\nThe katydids were clamoring drowsily in the tops of the sycamores.\nFrom out of sight beyond the orchard came the monotonous, musical whir\nof a reaper.  A quail whistled his pert, hopeful, careless \"Bob White!\"\nfrom the rail fence edging the wheat field.  A bumblebee grumbled among\na cluster of swaying clover blossoms which the mower had spared.  And\nthe breeze tossed up and rolled over the meadow, over the senses of the\nyoung man and the young woman, great billows of that perfume which is\nthe combined essence of all nature's love philters.\n\nPauline sank on the hay, and Scarborough stretched himself on the\nground at her feet.  \"For a long time it's been getting darker and\ndarker for me,\" she began, in the tone of one who is talking of some\npast sorrow which casts a retreating shadow over present joy to make it\nthe brighter by contrast.  \"To-day--this afternoon it seemed as if the\nlight were just about to go out--for good and all.  And I came here.  I\nfound myself lying on the ground--on the bosom of this old cruel--kind\nmother of ours. And--\"  She did not finish--he would know the rest.\nBesides, what did it matter--now?\n\nHe said:  \"If only there were some way in which I could help.\"\n\n\"It isn't the people who appear at the crises of one's life, like the\nhero on the stage, that really help.  I'm afraid the crises, the real\ncrises of real life, must always be met alone.\"\n\n\"Alone,\" he said in an undertone.  The sky was blue now--cloudless\nblue; but in that word alone he could hear the rumble of storms below\nthe horizon, storms past, storms to come.\n\n\"The real helpers,\" she went on, \"are those who strengthen us day by\nday, hour by hour.  And when no physical presence would do any good,\nwhen no outside aid is possible--they--it's like finding a wall at\none's back when one's in dread of being surrounded.  I suppose you\ndon't realize how much it means to--to how many people--to watch a man\nwho goes straight and strong on his way--without blustering, without\ntrampling anybody, without taking any mean advantage.  You don't mind\nmy saying these things?\"\n\nShe felt the look which she did not venture to face as he answered:  \"I\nneeded to hear them to-day.  For it seemed to me that I, too, had got\nto the limit of my strength.\"\n\n\"But you hadn't.\"  She said this confidently.\n\n\"No--I suppose not.  I've thought so before; but somehow I've always\nmanaged to gather myself together.  This time it was the work of years\napparently undone--hopelessly undone.  They\"--she understood that\n\"they\" meant the leaders of the two corrupt rings whose rule of the\nstate his power with the people menaced--\"they have bought away some of\nmy best men--bought them with those 'favors' that are so much more\ndisreputable than money because they're respectable.  Then they came to\nme\"--he laughed unpleasantly--\"and took me up into a high mountain and\nshowed me all the kingdoms of the earth, as it were.  I could be\ngovernor, senator, they said, could probably have the nomination for\npresident even,--not if I would fall down and worship them, but if I\nwould let them alone.  I could accomplish nearly all that I've worked\nso long to accomplish if I would only concede a few things to them.  I\ncould be almost free.  ALMOST--that is, not free at all.\"\n\nShe said:  \"And they knew you no better than that!\"\n\n\"Now,\" he continued, \"it looks as if I'll have to build all over again.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" she replied.  \"If they weren't still afraid of you\nthey'd never have come to you.  But what does it matter?  YOU don't\nfight for victory, you fight for the fight's sake.  And so\"--she looked\nat him proudly--\"you can't lose.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  Thank you,\" he said in a low voice.\n\nShe sighed.  \"How I envy you!  You LIVE.  I can simply be alive.\nSometimes I feel as if I were sitting in a railway station waiting to\nbegin my journey--waiting for a train that's late--nobody knows how\nlate.  Simply alive--that's all.\"\n\n\"That's a great deal,\" he said.  He was looking round at the sky, at\nthe horizon, at the fields far and near, at her.  \"A great deal,\" he\nrepeated.\n\n\"You feel that, too?\" She smiled.  \"I suppose I should live on through\nanything and everything, because, away down under the surface, where\neven the worst storms can't reach, there's always a sort of tremendous\njoy--the sense of being alive--just alive.\" She drew a long breath.\n\"Often when I've been--anything but happy--a little while ago, for\ninstance--I suddenly have a feeling of ecstasy.  I say to myself:  Yes,\nI'm unhappy, but--I'm ALIVE!\"\n\nHe made a sudden impulsive movement toward her, then restrained\nhimself, pressed his lips together and fell back on his elbow.\n\n\"I suppose I ought to be ashamed of myself,' she added.\n\n\"You mustn't say that.\"  He was sitting up, was speaking with all his\nenergy.  \"All that you were telling me a while ago to encourage me\napplies to you, too--and more--more.  You DO live. You ARE what you\nlong to be.  That ideal you're always trying to grasp--don't you know\nwhy you can't grasp it, Pauline?  Because it's your own self, your own\nimage reflected as in a mirror.\"\n\nHe broke off abruptly, acutely conscious that he was leaning far over\nthe barrier between them.  There was a distant shout, from vigorous,\nboyish lungs.  Gardiner, mad with the joy of healthy seven, came\nrunning and jumping across the field to land with a leap astride the\nhillock, scattering wisps of hay over his mother and Scarborough.\nPauline turned without getting up, caught her boy by the arms and with\nmock violence shook and thrust him deep down into the damaged hillock.\nShe seemed to be making an outlet for some happiness too great to be\ncontained.  He laughed and shouted and struggled, pushed and pulled\nher.  Her hat fell off, her hair loosened and the sun showered gold of\nmany shades upon it.  She released him and stood up, straightening and\nsmoothing her hair and breathing quickly, the color high in her cheeks.\n\nScarborough was already standing, watching her with an expression of\ngreat cheerfulness.\n\n\"Good-by,\" he now said.  \"The caravan\"--his tone was half-jesting,\nhalf-serious--\"has been spending the heat and dust of the day on the\noasis.  It makes night journeys only.  It must push on.\"\n\n\"Night journeys only,\" repeated Pauline.  \"That sounds gloomy.\"\n\n\"But there are the stars--and the moon.\"\n\nShe laughed.  \"And other oases ahead.  Good-by--and thank you!\"\n\nThe boy, close to his mother and facing Scarborough, was looking from\nher to him and back again--curiously, it almost seemed suspiciously.\nBoth noticed it; both flushed slightly. Scarborough shook hands with\nher, bowed to the little boy with a formality and constraint that might\nhave seemed ludicrous to an onlooker.  He went toward his horse;\nGardiner and his mother took the course at right angles across the\nfield in the direction in which the towers of the Eyrie could be seen\nabove the tree-tops. Suddenly the boy said, as if it were the\nconclusion of a long internal argument:  \"I like Mr. Scarborough.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked his mother, amused.\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" replied the boy.  \"Anyhow, I like him.  I wish he'd\ncome and stay with us and Aunt Gladys.\"\n\nGladys!  The reminder made her uncomfortable, made her feel that she\nought to be remorseful.  But she hastened on to defend herself.  What\nreason had she to believe that Gladys cared for him, except as she\nalways cared for difficult conquest?  Hadn't Gladys again and again\ngone out of her way to explain that she wasn't in love with him?\nHadn't she said, only two days before: \"I don't believe I could fall in\nlove with any man.  Certainly I couldn't unless he had made it very\nclear to me that he was in love with me.\"\n\nPauline had latterly been suspecting that these elaborations of\nsuperfluous protestation were Gladys' efforts to curtain herself. Now\nshe dwelt upon them with eager pleasure, and assured and reassured\nherself that she had been supersensitive and that Gladys had really\nbeen frank and truthful with her.\n\n\n\nXVIII.\n\nON THE FARM.\n\nOn his way down the bluffs to town Scarborough felt as calm and\npeaceful as that tranquil evening.  He had a sense of the end of a long\nstrain of which he had until then been unconscious.  \"NOW I can go away\nand rest,\" he said to himself.  And at sundown he set out for his farm.\n\nHe arrived at ten o'clock, by moonlight, amid a baying of dogs so\nenergetic that it roused every living thing in the barnyard to protest\nin a peevish chorus of clucking and grunting and quacking and squealing.\n\n\"What on airth!\" exclaimed Mrs. Gabbard, his farmer's wife, standing at\nthe back door, in calico skirt and big shawl.  When she saw who it was,\nher irritated voice changed to welcome. \"Why, howdy, Mr. Scarborough!\nI thought it was old John Lovel among the chickens or at the granary.\nI might 'a' knowed he wouldn't come in the full of the moon and no\nclouds.\"\n\n\"Go straight back to bed, Mrs. Gabbard, and don't mind me,\" said\nScarborough.  \"I looked after my horse and don't want anything to eat.\nWhere's Eph?\"\n\n\"Can't you hear?\" asked Mrs. Gabbard, dryly.  And in the pause a lusty\nsnore penetrated.  \"When anything out of the way happens, I get up and\nnose around to see whether it's worth while to wake him.\"\n\nScarborough laughed.  \"I've come for a few days--to get some exercise,\"\nhe said.  \"But don't wake me with the others to-morrow morning.  I'm\naway behind on sleep and dead tired.\"\n\nHe went to bed--the rooms up-stairs in front were reserved for him and\nwere always ready.  His brain was apparently as busy and as determined\nnot to rest as on the worst of his many bad nights during the past four\nmonths.  But the thoughts were vastly different; and soon those\nmillions of monotonous murmurings from brook and field and forest were\nsoothing his senses.  He slept soundly, with that complete relaxing of\nevery nerve and muscle which does not come until the mind wholly yields\nup its despotic control and itself plunges into slumber unfathomable.\n\nThe change of the air with dawn slowly wakened him.  It was only a\nlittle after five, but he felt refreshed.  He got himself into farm\nworking clothes and went down to the summer dining-room--a shed against\nthe back of the house with three of its walls latticed.  In the\nadjoining kitchen Mrs. Gabbard and her daughters, Sally and Bertha,\nwere washing the breakfast dishes--Gabbard and his two sons and the\nthree \"hands\" had just started for the meadows with the hay wagons.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Scarborough, looking in on the three women.\n\nThey stopped work and smiled at him, and the girls dried their hands\nand shook hands with him--all with an absolute absence of embarrassment\nthat, to one familiar with the awkward shyness of country people, would\nhave told almost the whole story of Scarborough's character.  \"I'll get\nyou some breakfast in the dining-room,\" said Mrs. Gabbard.\n\n\"No--just a little--on the corner of the table out here,\" replied\nScarborough.\n\nMrs. Gabbard and Sally bustled about while he stood in the doorway of\nthe shed, looking out into the yard and watching the hens make their\ncareful early morning tour of the inclosure to glean whatever might be\nthere before scattering for the day's excursions and depredations.  He\nhad not long to wait and he did not linger over what was served.\n\n\"You've et in a manner nothing,\" complained Mrs. Gabbard.\n\n\"I haven't earned an appetite yet,\" he replied.  \"Just wait till this\nevening.\"\n\nAs soon as he was out of view he gave a great shout and started to run.\n\"What folly to bother with, a foolish, trouble-breeding thinking\napparatus in a world like this!\" he thought, as the tremendous currents\nof vitality surged through him.  And he vaulted a six-rail fence and\nran on.  Down the hollow drenched with dew, across the brook which was\nreally wide enough to be called a creek, up the steep slope of the\nopposite hill at a slower pace, and he was at the edge of the meadows.\nThe sun was clear of the horizon now, and the two wagons, piled high\nwith hay and \"poled down\" to keep the loads steady, were about to move\noff to the barn.\n\n\"Bring back a fork for me, Bill!\" he called to the driver of the nearer\nwagon--Bill was standing on the lofty top of his load, which projected\nforward and rear so far that, forward, the horses were half canopied.\nAgainst Bill's return he borrowed Gabbard's fork and helped complete\nthe other wagon, the sweat streaming from his face as his broad\nshoulders swung down with the empty fork and up with a great mat of hay.\n\nThey worked alternately in the fields and at the barns until half-past\neleven.  Then they went into the shade at the edge of the meadow and\nhad their dinner.\n\n\"My old woman,\" said Gabbard, \"says that two set-down meals a day in\nharvest time's as many as she'll stand for.  So we have dinner out here\nin good weather, and to the barn when it rains.\"\n\nThe talk was of weather prospects, of probable tonnage to the acre, of\nthe outlook for the corn, of the health and family expectations of the\nmares and the cows and the pigs.  It died away gradually as one man\nafter another stretched out upon his back with a bunch of hay for an\nodorous pillow and his broad-brimmed straw hat for a light-shade.\nScarborough was the fourth man to yield; as he dozed off his hat was\nhiding that smile of boundless content which comes only to him who\nstretches his well body upon grass or soft stubble and feels the vigor\nof the earth steal up and through him.  \"Why don't I do this oftener?\"\nScarborough was saying to himself.  \"I must--and I shall, now that my\nmind's more at ease.\"\n\nA long afternoon of the toil that tires and vexes not, and at sundown\nhe was glad to ride home on top of the last wagon instead of walking as\nhe had intended.  The supper-table was ready--was spread in the\ndining-shed.  They washed their hands and sunburnt arms and soused\ntheir heads in cold water from the well, and sat, Scarborough at one\nend, Gabbard at the other, the strapping sons and the \"hands\" down\neither side.  The whole meal was before them--huge platters of fried\nchicken, great dishes full of beans and corn and potatoes; plates piled\nhigh with hot corn bread, other plates of \"salt-rising\"; Mrs. Gabbard's\nmiraculous apple pies, and honey for which the plundered flowers might\nstill be mourning.  Yesterday it would have seemed to Scarborough\ndinner enough for a regiment.  To-day--he thought he could probably eat\nit all, and wished that he might try.  To drink, there were coffee and\ncider and two kinds of milk.  He tried the buttermilk and kept on with\nit.\n\n\"You must 'a' had a busy summer,\" said Gabbard.  \"This is the first\ntime you've been with us.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Scarborough replied.  \"I did hope to get here for the threshing,\nbut I couldn't.\"\n\nThe threshing set them all off--it had been a record year; thirty-eight\nbushels to the acre on the average, twenty-seven on the hillsides which\nGabbard had hesitated whether to \"put in\" or not.  An hour after supper\nScarborough could no longer hold his eyes open.  \"Wake me with the\nothers,\" he said to Mrs. Gabbard, who was making up the \"salt-rising\"\nyeast for the morrow's baking.  \"I'll have breakfast when they do.\"\n\n\"I reckon you've earned it,\" said Mrs. Gabbard.  \"Eph says you laid it\nover 'em all to-day.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess I at least earned my supper,\" replied Scarborough.  \"And\nI guess I ate it.\"\n\n\"You didn't do so bad, considerin',\" Mrs. Gabbard admitted. \"Nothin'\nlike livin' in town to take appetite away.\"\n\n\"That isn't all it takes away,\" said Scarborough, going on to his own\npart of the house without explaining his remark.  When his head touched\nthe pillow his brain instantly stopped the machinery.  He needed no\ncroonings or dronings from the fields to soothe him.  \"Not an idea in\nmy head all day,\" he said to himself with drowsy delight.\n\n\nFour days of this, and on the fifth came the outside world in the form\nof Burdick, chairman of the county committee of his party in the county\nin which his farm lay.  They sat on the fence under the big maple, out\nof earshot of the others.\n\n\"Larkin's come out for John Frankfort for the nomination for governor,\"\nsaid Burdick.\n\nScarborough smiled.  \"Even Larkin couldn't get it for Frankfort--he's\ntoo notorious.\"\n\n\"He don't want to get it for him,\" replied Burdick.  \"His real man's\nJudge Graney.\"\n\nScarborough stopped fanning himself with his wide-brimmed straw. Judge\nGraney was the most adroit and dangerous of John Dumont's tools.  He\nhad given invaluable aid from the bench at several of the National\nWoolens Company's most critical moments.  Yet he had retained and\nincreased his popularity and his reputation by deciding against his\nsecret master with a brave show of virtue when he knew the higher\ncourts must reverse him.  For several years Scarborough had been\nlooking forward to the inevitable open conflict between the forces of\nhonesty in his party and the forces of the machine as ruled by the\nhalf-dozen big corporations who also ruled the machine of the\nopposition party.  He had known that the contest must come, and that he\nmust take part in it; and he had been getting ready.  But he had not\nwished to give battle until he was strong enough to give a battle\nwhich, even if he lost it, would not strengthen the hold of the\ncorruptionists.\n\nAfter he rejected Larkin's dazzling offers, conditioned upon his\naloofness rather than frank subservience, he had thought the whole\nsituation over, and, as he hinted to Pauline, had realized how\napparently hopeless a fight against the machine would be just then,\nwith the people prosperous and therefore quiescent.  And he had decided\nto stand aside for the time.  He now saw that reluctance to attack\nDumont had been at least a factor in this decision; and he also saw\nthat he could not delay, as he had hoped.  There was no escape--either\nhe must let his work of years be undermined and destroyed or he must\ngive battle with all his strength and skill.  He remembered what\nPauline had said:  \"You can't lose!\"\n\n\"No, one can't lose in this sort of fight,\" he thought. \"Either WE win\nor there'll be no victory.\"  He sprang from the fence to the ground.\n\"Let's go to the house,\" he said to Burdick.\n\n\"What you going to do?\" asked Burdick, as they walked toward the gate,\nwhere his horse and buggy were hitched.\n\n\"Fight, of course,\" said Scarborough.  \"Fight Larkin and his gang in\nthe open.  I'll get ex-Governor Bowen to let us use his name and\ncanvass the state for him.\"\n\nBurdick shook his head sadly.\n\n\"It ain't politics,\" he said.  \"You'll split the party; then the\nparty'll turn and split you.\"  And later, as they were separating,\nScarborough to drive to Saint X, Burdick to go back to Marshaltown, he\nsaid:  \"I'll help all I can in a quiet way. But--I hope you've got your\ncyclone cellar dug.\"\n\nScarborough laughed.  \"I haven't been digging a cyclone cellar. I've\nbeen trying to manufacture a cyclone.\"\n\nThere were thirty-three clear days before the meeting of the\nconvention.  He wasted not an hour of them on the manufacturing towns;\nhe went to the country--to the farmers and the villagers, the men who\nlived each man in his own house, on his own soil from which he earned\nhis own living.  Up and down and across the state he went, speaking,\norganizing, planning, inspiring--he and the coterie of young men who\nlooked up to him as their leader and followed him in this desperate\nassault as courageously as if victory were assured.\n\nNot long before the convention he paused at ex-Judge Bowen's country\nplace and spent two hours with him in his great, quiet, cool library.\n\n\"Isn't it inspiring,\" Scarborough said, \"to see so many young men in\narms for a principle?\"\n\nThe old man slowly shook his magnificent white head and smiled at the\nyoung man.  \"Principles without leaders go begging,\" he replied.  \"Men\nrally to the standard only when the right voice calls.  The right voice\nat the right time.\"  He laid his hand on Scarborough's shoulder with\naffection and pride.  \"If the moment should come for you to think of\nit, do not forget that the leader is the principle, and that in this\nfight the leader is not I--but you.\"\n\n\n\nXIX.\n\nPAULINE GOES INTO POLITICS.\n\nLarkin decided that the state convention should be held at Saint X\nbecause his machine was most perfect there.  The National Woolens\nCompany, the Consolidated Pipe and Wire Company and the Indiana Oil and\nGas Corporation--the three principal political corporations in the\nstate--had their main plants there and were in complete political\ncontrol.  While Larkin had no fear of the Scarborough movement,\nregarding it as a sentimental outburst in the rank and file of the\nparty that would die away when its fomenter had been \"read out of the\nparty\" at the convention by the regular organization, still he had been\nin the game too long to take unnecessary chances.  He felt that it\nwould be wise to have the delegates assemble where all the surroundings\nwould be favorable and where his ablest and confidential men could do\ntheir work in peace and quiet.\n\nThe convention was to, meet on the last Thursday in September. On the\npreceding Monday morning, Culver--Dumont's small, thin, stealthy\nprivate secretary--arrived at Saint X and, after making an appointment\nwith Merriweather for half-past twelve, went out to the Eyrie to go\nthrough a lot of accumulated domestic business with Mrs. Dumont.  When\nshe in a most formal and unencouraging manner invited him to stop\nthere, he eagerly accepted.  \"Thank you so much,\" he said effusively.\n\"To be perfectly frank, I've been tempted to invite myself.  I have\nsome valuables with me that I don't feel at all easy about.  If I\nshould be robbed, it would be a very serious matter.  Would it be\nasking too much of you to ask you to put a package in your jewel safe?\"\n\n\"I'll be glad to do it for you,\" replied Pauline.  \"There's plenty of\nroom--the safe's almost empty and it's ridiculously large.\"\n\n\"My package isn't small,\" said Culver.  \"And on my mind it weighs\ntons.\"  He reached into his large bag--at sight of it Pauline had\nwondered why he had brought such a bag up from the hotel when his\npapers for her inspection were so few.  He lifted out an oblong, bulky\npackage.\n\n\"If you'll just touch that button,\" said she, \"James will come and show\nyou how to get to the safe.\"\n\nCulver hesitated nervously.  Finally he said:  \"I'm making a nuisance\nof myself, Mrs. Dumont, but would you mind going to the safe with me?\nI'd much rather none of the servants knew about this.\"\n\nPauline smiled and bade him follow her.  They went to her private\nsitting-room and she showed him the safe, in a small closet built into\nthe lower part of the book-case.  \"You have the combination?\" asked\nCulver, as he put the package away.\n\n\"I see that you don't lock this door often.\"\n\n\"How fortunate you spoke of it!\" said she.\n\n\"The combination is on a bit of paper in one of the little drawers.\"\n\nCulver found it in the first drawer he opened, and handed it to her\nwithout looking at it.\n\n\"You mustn't let me know it,\" said he.  \"I'll just fix the time lock so\nthat it won't interfere.\"  And when he had done so, he closed the safe.\nAs he left, he said, \"I shall only bother you to let me sleep in the\nhouse.  I'll be very busy all day each day I'm here.\"  When she thought\nhe had gone he returned to add: \"Perhaps I'd better explain to you that\nthere's forty-five thousand dollars in cash in the package.  That's why\nI was so anxious for no one to know.\"\n\n\"I'll say nothing about it,\" Pauline assured him.\n\nLarkin came down from Indianapolis the next day and registered at the\nPalace Hotel.  As soon as he could escape from the politicians and\nnewspaper correspondents in the hotel office, he went by a devious\nroute to a room on the floor below his own and, knocking, was admitted\nto Culver and Merriweather.  He nodded to Dumont's political agent,\nthen said to Culver:  \"You've got the dough?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Culver answered, in his best imitation of the tone of the man of\nlarge affairs.  \"In twenties, fifties and hundreds.\"\n\n\"I hope, mighty few hundreds,\" said Larkin.  \"The boys are kind o' shy\nabout changing hundred-dollar bills.  It seems to attract attention to\nthem.\"  He had large, dreamy, almost sentimental, brown eyes that\nabsurdly misrepresented his character, or, at least, his dominant\ncharacteristics.  His long, slightly bent nose and sharp chin and thin,\ntight mouth were more truthful.\n\n\"How do things look, Joe?\" asked Merriweather.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Dumont asked me to telegraph him after I'd talked with you,\"\nsaid Culver.  \"Has Scarborough made much headway?\"\n\n\"I must say, he's raised a darn sight more hell than I thought he\nwould,\" Larkin answered.\n\n\"The people seem to be in a nasty mood about corruption.  Darn their\nfool souls, as if they wouldn't be in the rottenest kind of a fix, with\nno property and no jobs, if we didn't keep the ignorant vote under\ncontrol and head off such firebrands as this fellow Scarborough.\"\n\n\"Got any figgers?\" demanded Merriweather, who had listened to this\ntirade with an expression suggesting cynicism.  He thought, and he knew\nJoe Larkin thought, politics a mere game of chance--you won or you\ndidn't win; and principles and oratory and likes and dislikes and\nresentments were so much \"hot air.\"  If the \"oil can\" had been with\nScarborough, Merriweather would have served him as cheerfully and as\nloyally as--well, as would Joe Larkin in those circumstances.\n\nLarkin wrenched a big bunch of letters and papers from the sagged\ninside pocket of his slouchy sack coat; after some fumbling and\nsorting, he paused upon the back of a dirty envelope.\n\n\"Here's how the convention stands, to a man,\" he said.  \"Sure, two\nhundred and sixty-seven-by 'sure' I mean the fellows we own outright.\nSafe, two hundred and forty-five-by 'safe' I mean those that'll stand\nby the organization, thick and thin. Insurgents, two hundred and\nninety-five--those are the chaps that've gone clean crazy with\nScarborough.  Doubtful, three hundred and eighty-six-some of 'em can be\nbought; most of 'em are waiting to see which way the cat jumps, so as\nto jump with her.\"\n\n\"Then we've got five hundred and twelve, and it takes five hundred and\nninety-seven to elect,\" said Merriweather, the instant the last word\nwas out of Larkin's mouth.  Merriweather was a mite of a man, could\nhardly have weighed more than a hundred pounds, had a bulging forehead,\nwas bald and gray at the temples, eyes brown as walnut juice and quick\nand keen as a rat-terrier's.  His expression was the gambler's--calm,\nwatchful, indifferent, pallid, as from years of nights under the\ngas-light in close, hot rooms, with the cards sliding from the faro box\nhour after hour.\n\n\"Eighty-five short--that's right,\" assented Larkin.  Then, with a look\nat Culver:  \"And some of 'em'll come mighty high.\"\n\n\"Where are you going to do business with them?\" inquired Merriweather.\n\"Here?\"\n\n\"Right here in this room, where I've done it many's the time before,\"\nreplied Larkin.  \"To-morrow night Conkey Sedgwick and my boy Tom'll\nbegin steerin' 'em in one at a time about eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"Then I'll turn the money over to you at seven to-morrow night,\" said\nCulver.  \"I've got it in a safe place.\"\n\n\"Not one of the banks, I hope,\" said Merriweather.\n\n\"We noted your suggestions on that point, and on all the others,\"\nCulver answered with gracious condescension.  \"That's why I brought\ncash in small denominations and didn't go near anybody with it.\"\n\nLarkin rose.  \"I've got to get to work.  See you here to-morrow night\nat seven, Mr. Culver--seven sharp.  I guess it'll be Judge Graney on\nthe third ballot.  On the first ballot the organization'll vote solid\nfor Graney, and my fellows'll vote for John Frankfort.  On the second\nballot half my Frankfort crowd'll switch over to Graney.  On the third\nI'll put the rest of 'em over, and that'll be enough to elect--probably\nthe Scarborough crowd'll see it's no use and let us make it unanimous.\nThe losers are always hot for harmony.\"\n\n\"That sounds well,\" said Merriweather--his was a voice that left his\nhearers doubtful whether he meant what his words said or the reverse.\n\nCulver looked with secret admiration from one man to the other, and\ncontinued to think of them and to admire, after they had gone.  He felt\nimportant, sitting in and by proxy directing the councils of these\npowerful men, these holders and manipulators of the secret strings\nwhereto were attached puppet peoples and puppet politicians.  Seven\nyears behind the scenes with Dumont's most private affairs had given\nhim a thoroughgoing contempt for the mass of mankind.  Did he not sit\nbeside the master, at the innermost wheels, deep at the very heart of\nthe intricate mechanism?  Did not that position make him a sort of\nmaster, at any rate far superior to the princeliest puppet?\n\nAt five the next afternoon--the afternoon of the day before the\nconvention--he was at the Eyrie, and sent a servant to say to Mrs.\nDumont that he would like to see her.  She came down to him in the\nlibrary.\n\n\"I'm only troubling you for a moment,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll relieve you of my package.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Pauline.  \"I haven't thought of it since day before\nyesterday.  I'll bring it down to you.\"\n\nShe left him in the library and went up the stairs--she had been\nreading everything that was published about the coming convention, and\nthe evident surprise of all the politicians at the strength Scarborough\nwas mustering for ex-Governor Bowen had put her in high good humor.\nShe cautioned herself that he could not carry the convention; but his\nshowing was a moral victory--and what a superb personal triumph!  With\neverything against him--money and the machine and the skilful confusing\nof the issues by his crafty opponents--he had rallied about him almost\nall that was really intelligent in his party; and he had demonstrated\nthat he had on his side a mass of the voters large out of all\nproportion to the number of delegates he had wrested away from the\nmachine--nearly three hundred, when everybody had supposed the machine\nwould retain all but a handful.\n\nMoney!  Her lips curled scornfully--out here, in her own home, among\nthese simple people, the brutal power of money was master just as in\nNew York, among a people crazed by the passion for luxury and display.\n\nShe was kneeling before the safe, was working the combination, paper in\nhand.  The knob clicked as the rings fell into place; she turned the\nbolt and swung the door open.  She reached into the safe.  Suddenly she\ndrew her hand back and sat up on the floor, looking at the package.\n\"Why, it's for use in the convention!\" she exclaimed.\n\nShe did not move for several minutes; when she did, it was to examine\nthe time lock, to reset it, to close the door and bolt it and throw the\nlock off the combination.  Then she rose and slowly descended to the\nlibrary.  As she reappeared, empty-handed, Culver started violently and\nscrutinized her face.  Its expression put him in a panic.  \"Mrs.\nDumont!\" he exclaimed wildly.\n\n\"Has it been stolen?\"\n\nShe shook her head.  \"No,\" she said.  \"It's there.\"\n\nTrembling from weakness in the reaction, he leaned against the table,\nwiping his sweating brow with sweating hands.\n\n\"But,\" she went on, \"it must stay there.\"\n\nHe looked open-mouthed at her.\n\n\"You have brought the money out here for use in the convention,\" she\nwent on with perfect calmness.  \"You have tried to make me a partner in\nthat vile business.  And--I refuse to play the part assigned me.  I\nshall keep the money until the convention is over.\"\n\nHe looked round like a terror-stricken drowning man, about to sink for\nthe last time.\n\n\"I'm ruined!  I'm ruined!\" he almost screamed.\n\n\"No,\" she said, still calm.  \"You will not be ruined, though you\ndeserve to be.  But I understand why you have become callous to the\ncommonplace decencies of life, and I shall see to it that no harm comes\nto you.\"\n\n\"Mr. Dumont will--DESTROY me!  You don't realize, Mrs. Dumont. Vast\nproperty interests are at stake on the result of this\nconvention--that's our cause.  And you are imperiling it!\"\n\n\"Imperiling a cause that needs lies and bribes to save it?\" she said\nironically.  \"Please calm yourself, Mr. Culver.  You certainly can't be\nblamed for putting your money in a safe place. I take the\nresponsibility for the rest.  And when you tell Mr. Dumont exactly what\nhappened, you will not be blamed or injured in any way.\"\n\n\"I shall telegraph him at once,\" he warned her.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Pauline.  \"He might blame you severely for failing to\ndo that.\"\n\nHe paused in his pacing up and down the room.  He flung his arms toward\nher, his eyes blazing.\n\n\"I WILL have it!\" he exclaimed.  \"Do you hear me, I WILL! I'll bring\nmen from down-town and have the safe blown open.  The money is not\nyours--it is----\"\n\nShe advanced to the bell.\n\n\"Another word, Mr. Culver, and I'll have the servants show you the\ndoor.  Yours is a strange courage--to dare to speak thus to me when\nyour head should be hanging in shame for trying to make such base use\nof me and my courtesy and friendliness.\"\n\nHis arms dropped, and he lowered his head.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said humbly.  \"I'm not myself.  I think I'm\ngoing insane.  PITY me!\"\n\nPauline looked at him sadly.  \"I wish I had the right to. But--I\nSYMPATHIZE, and I'm sorry--so sorry--to have to do this.\" A pause,\nthen--\"Good afternoon, Mr. Culver.\"  And she moved toward the door.  At\nthe threshold she turned.  \"I must say one thing further--THE\nCONVENTION MUST NOT BE PUT OFF.  If it is adjourned to-morrow without\nmaking nominations, I shall understand that you are getting the money\nelsewhere.  And--I shall be compelled to put such facts as I know in\nthe possession of--of those you came to injure.\"  And she was gone.\n\nCulver went to Merriweather's office and sent out for him and Larkin.\nWhen they arrived he shut the doors and told them what had\nhappened--and in his manner there was not left a trace of the New\nYorker and ambassador condescending to westerners and underlings.\nLarkin cursed; Merriweather gave no outward sign. Presently\nMerriweather said:  \"Larkin, you must adjourn the convention over\nto-morrow.  Culver can go to Chicago and get back with the money by\nto-morrow night.\"\n\n\"No use,\" groaned Culver.  And he told them the last part of his talk\nwith Mrs. Dumont.\n\n\"She thought of that!\" said Merriweather, and he looked the impartial\nadmiration of the connoisseur of cleverness.\n\n\"But she'd never carry out her threat--never in the world!\" persisted\nLarkin.\n\n\"If you had seen her when she said it, and if you'd known her as long\nas I have, you wouldn't say that,\" replied Culver.  \"We must try to get\nthe money here, right away--at the banks.\"\n\n\"All shut,\" said Merriweather \"I wonder how much cash there is at the\nWoolens and the Oil and Steel offices?  We must get together as much as\nwe can--quietly.\"  And he rapidly outlined a program that put all three\nat work within fifteen minutes.  They met again at seven.  Culver had\ntwenty-six hundred dollars, Larkin thirty-one hundred, Merriweather,\nwho had kept for himself the most difficult task, had only twelve\nhundred.\n\n\"Sixty-nine hundred,\" said Merriweather, eying the heap, of paper in\npackages and silver in bags.\n\n\"Better than nothing,\" suggested Culver, with a pitiful attempt to be\nhopeful.\n\nMerriweather shrugged his shoulders.  \"Let's get some supper,\" he said\nto Culver.  Then to Larkin:  \"Well, Joe, you'll have to try promises.\nWill you keep this cash or shall I?\"\n\n\"You might as well keep it,\" replied Larkin, with a string of oaths.\n\"It'd be ruination to pay one without paying all. Perhaps you can use\nsome of it between ballots to-morrow.\" Then, sharply to Culver:\n\"You've telegraphed Mr. Dumont?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Culver.  \"And it took some time as I had to put the\nwhole story into cipher.\"\n\nAs Culver and Merriweather were seated, with the dinner before them\nwhich Culver did not touch, and which Merriweather ate placidly, Culver\nasked him whether there was \"any hope at all.\"\n\n\"There's always hope,\" replied Merriweather.  \"Promises, especially\nfrom Joe Larkin, will go a long way, though they don't rouse the white\nhot enthusiasm that cold cash in the pocket does. We'll pull through\nall right.\"  He ate for a while in silence. Then:  \"This Mrs. Dumont\nmust be an uncommon woman.\"  A few more mouthfuls and with his small,\nicy, mirthless laugh, he added:  \"I've got one something like her at\nhome.  I keep her there.\"\n\nCulver decided to spend the night at the hotel.  He hung round the\nhotel office until two in the morning, expecting and dreading Dumont's\nreply to his telegram.  But nothing came either for him or for\nMerriweather.  \"Queer we don't get word of some sort, isn't it?\" said\nhe to Merriweather the next morning, as the latter was leaving for the\nconvention.\n\nMerriweather made no reply beyond a smile so faint that Culver barely\nsaw it.\n\n\"She was right, after all,\" thought Culver, less despondent. \"I'll get\nthe money just before I leave and take it back.  And I'll not open this\nsubject with Dumont.  Maybe he'll never speak of it to me.\"\n\nAnd Dumont never did.\n\n\n\nXX.\n\nA MAN IN HIS MIGHT.\n\nOlivia came to attend the convention as Fred was a delegate from Marion\nCounty.  Pauline and Gladys accepted her invitation and shared her\nbox--the convention was held in the Saint X Grand Opera House, the\nsecond largest auditorium in the state. Pauline, in the most retired\ncorner, could not see the Marion County delegation into which\nScarborough went by substitution. But she had had a glimpse of him as\nshe came in--he was sitting beside Fred Pierson and was gazing straight\nahead, as if lost in thought.  He looked tired and worn, but not cast\ndown.\n\n\"You should have been here, Polly, when Scarborough came in,\" said\nOlivia, who was just in front of her.  \"They almost tore the roof off.\nHe's got the audience with him, even if the delegates aren't.  A good\nmany of the delegates applauded, too,\" she added--but in a\nsignificantly depressed tone.\n\n\"Why isn't he a candidate, Mrs. Pierson?\" asked Gladys.\n\n\"They wanted him to be, of course,\" replied Olivia, \"and I think it was\na mistake that he didn't consent.  But he wouldn't hear of it.  He said\nit simply wouldn't do for him to make the fight to carry the convention\nfor himself.  He said that, even if he were nominated, the other side\nwould use it against him.\"\n\n\"That seems reasonable,\" said Gladys.\n\n\"But it isn't,\" replied Olivia.  \"He may not know it but he can lead\nmen where they wouldn't go for his merely sending them.\"\n\n\"I suppose it was his modesty,\" suggested Gladys.\n\n\"Modesty's a good deal of a vice, especially in a leader,\" replied\nOlivia.\n\nThere was an hour of dullness--routine business, reports of committees,\nwearisome speeches.  But, like every one of those five thousand people,\nPauline was in a fever of anticipation. For, while it was generally\nassumed that Scarborough and his friends had no chance and while Larkin\nwas apparently carrying everything through according to program, still\nit was impossible to conceive of such a man as Scarborough accepting\ndefeat on test votes tamely taken.  He would surely challenge.  Larkin\nwatched him uneasily, wondering at what point in the proceedings the\ngage would be flung down.  Even Merriweather could not keep still, but\nflitted about, his nervousness of body contrasting strangely with his\ncalmness of face; himself the most unquiet man in the hall, he diffused\nquiet wherever he paused.\n\nAt last came the call for nominations.  When the secretary of the\nconvention read Cass from the roll of counties, a Larkin henchman rose\nand spoke floridly for twenty minutes on the virtues of John Frankfort,\nput up as the Larkin \"draw-fire,\" the pretended candidate whose\nprearranged defeat was to be used on the stump as proof that Boss\nLarkin and his gang had been downed.  At the call of Hancock County,\nanother--a secret--Larkin henchman rose to eulogize \"that stanch foe of\ncorporate corruption and aggression, Hancock County's favorite son, the\npeople's judge, Judge Edward Howel Graney!\"  Then the roll-call\nproceeded amid steadily rising excitement which abruptly died into\nsilence as the clerk shouted, with impressive emphasis, \"Wayne!\"  That\nwas the home county of the Scarborough candidate.  A Wayne delegate\nrose and in a single sentence put ex-Governor Bowen in nomination.\nThere was a faint ripple of applause which was instantly checked.  A\nsilence of several seconds and--\n\n\"Mr. Chairman, and gentle--\"\n\nIt was the voice Pauline knew so well.  She could not see him, but that\nvoice seemed to make him visible to her.  She caught her breath and her\nheart beat wildly.  He got no further into seconding Bowen's nomination\nthan the middle of the fourth word. There may have been ears offended\nby the thunder-clap which burst in that theater, but those ears were\nnot Pauline's, were not in Olivia Pierson's box.  And then came\ntumbling and roaring, huge waves of adulation, with his name shouted in\nvoices hoarse and voices shrill like hissing foam on the triumphant\ncrests of billows.  And Pauline felt as if she were lifted from her\nbodily self, were tossing in a delirium of ecstasy on a sea of sheer\ndelight.\n\nAnd now he was on the platform, borne there above the shoulders of a\nhundred men.  He was standing pale and straight and mighty. He\nstretched out his hand, so large and strong, and somehow as honest as\nhis eyes; the tempest stilled.  He was speaking--what did he say?  She\nhardly heard, though she knew that it was of and for right and\njustice--what else could that voice utter or the brain behind those\nproud features think?  With her, and with all there, far more than his\nwords it was his voice, like music, like magic, rising and falling in\nthrilling inflections as it wove its spell of gold and fire.  Whenever\nhe paused there would be an instant of applause--a huge, hoarse\nthunder, the call of that mysterious and awful and splendid soul of the\nmass--an instant full of that one great, deep, throbbing note, then\nsilence to hear him again.\n\nScarborough had measured his task--to lift that convention from the\nslough of sordidness to which the wiles and bribes of Dumont and his\nclique had lured it; to set it in the highroad of what he believed with\nall his intensity to be the high-road of right. Usually he spoke with\nfeeling strongly repressed; but he knew that if he was to win that day\nagainst such odds he must take those delegates by surprise and by\nstorm, must win in a suddenly descended whirlwind of passion that would\nengulf calculation and craft, sordidness and cynicism.  He made few\ngestures; he did not move from the position he had first taken.  He\nstaked all upon his voice; into it he poured all his energy, all his\nfire, all his white-hot passion for right and justice, all his scorn of\nthe base and the low.\n\n\"Head above heart, when head is right,\" he had often said. \"But when\nhead is wrong, then heart above head.\"  And he reached for hearts that\nday.\n\nFive minutes, and delegates and spectators were his captives. Fifteen\nminutes, and he was riding a storm such as comes only when the\nfountains of the human deeps are broken up.  Thirty minutes and he was\nriding it as its master, was guiding it where he willed.\n\nIn vain Larkin sought to rally delegates round the shamed but steadfast\nnucleus of the bribed and the bossed.  In vain his orator moved an\nadjournment until \"calmness and reason shall be restored.\"  The answer\nmade him shrink and sink into his seat. For it was an awful, deafening\nroll of the war-drums of that exalted passion which Scarborough had\nroused.\n\nThe call of counties began.  The third on the list--Bartholomew--was\nthe first to say what the people longed to hear.  A giant farmer, fiery\nand freckled, rose and in a voice like a blast from a bass horn\nbellowed:  \"Bartholomew casts her solid vote for Hampden Scarborough!\"\n\nPauline had thought she heard that multitude speak before.  But she now\nknew she had heard hardly more than its awakening whisper.  For, with\nthe pronouncing of that name, the tempest really burst.  She sprang to\nher feet, obeying the imperious inward command which made every one in\nthat audience and most of the delegates leap up.  And for ten long\nminutes, for six hundred cyclonic seconds, the people poured out their\npassionate adoration.  At first Scarborough flung out his arms, and all\ncould see that he was shouting some sort of protest.  But they would\nnot hear him now.  He had told them WHAT to do.  He must let them say\nHOW to do it.\n\nPauline looked out at those flaming thousands with the maddest emotions\nstreaming like lightning from their faces.  But she looked without\nfear.  They--she--all were beside themselves; but it was no frenzy for\nblood or for the sordid things.  It was the divine madness of the\nsoldier of the right, battling for THE CAUSE, in utter forgetfulness of\nself and selfishness. \"Beautiful!  Beautiful!\" she murmured, every\nnerve tingling. \"I never knew before how beautiful human beings are!\"\n\nFinally the roll-call could proceed.  Long before it was ended the\nnecessary votes had been cast for Scarborough, and Larkin rose to move\nthat the nomination be made unanimous--Larkin, beaten down in the open,\nwas not the man to die there; he hastened to cover where he could\nresume the fight in the manner most to his liking.  Again Scarborough\nwas borne to the platform; again she saw him standing there--straight\nand mighty, but deathly pale, and sad--well he might be bowed by the\nresponsibility of that mandate, given by the god-in-man, but to be\nexecuted by and through plain men.  A few broken, hesitating words, and\nhe went into the wings and left the theater, applause sweeping and\nswirling after him like a tidal wave.\n\nPauline, coming out into the open, looked round her, dazed.  Why, it\nwas the same work-a-day world as before, with its actions so\ncommonplace and selfish, with only its impulses fine and high. If these\nmoments of exaltation could but last, could but become the fixed order\nand routine of life!  If high ideal and courage ruled, instead of low\ncalculation and fear!  She sighed, then her eyes shone.\n\n\"At least I have seen!\" she thought.  \"At least I have lived one of\nthose moments when the dreams come true.  And 'human being' has a new\nmeaning for me.\"\n\nTwo men, just behind her in the crowd, were talking of Scarborough.  \"A\ndemagogue!\" sneered one.\n\n\"A demi-god,\" retorted the other.  And Pauline turned suddenly and gave\nhim a look that astonished and dazzled him.\n\n\n\nXXI.\n\nA COYOTE AT BAY.\n\nSix weeks later, on the morning after the general election, Dumont\nawoke bubbling over with good humor--as always, when the world went\nwell with him and so set the strong, red currents of his body to\nflowing in unobstructed channels.\n\nHe had not gone to bed the previous night until he had definite news\nfrom Indiana, Illinois and New York, the three states in which his\nindustrial-political stakes were heaviest.  They had gone as he wished,\nas he and his friends had spent large sums of money to assist them to\ngo.  And now a glance at the morning papers confirmed his midnight\nbulletins.  Indiana, where he had made the strongest efforts because\nthe control of its statute book was vital to him, had gone his way\nbarely but, apparently, securely; Scarborough was beaten for governor\nby twenty-five hundred.  Presently he had Culver in to begin the day's\nbusiness. The first paper Culver handed him was a cipher telegram\nannouncing the closing of an agreement which made the National Woolens\nCompany absolute in the Northwest; the second item in Culver's budget\nwas also a cipher telegram--from Merriweather. It had been filed at\nfour o'clock--several hours later than the newspaper despatches.  It\nsaid that Scarborough's friends conceded his defeat, that the\nLegislature was safely Dumont's way in both houses.  Culver always\nsorted out to present first the agreeable part of the morning's budget;\nnever had he been more successful.\n\nAt the office Dumont found another cipher telegram from Merriweather:\n\"Later returns show Scarborough elected by a narrow majority.  But he\nwill be powerless as Legislature and all other state offices are with\nus.\"\n\nDumont crushed the telegram in his hand.  \"Powerless--hell!\" he\nmuttered.  \"Does he think I'm a fool?\"  He had spent three hundred\nthousand dollars to \"protect\" his monopoly in its home; for it was\nunder Indiana laws, as interpreted by Dumont's agents in public office,\nthat the main or holding corporation of his group was organized.  And\nhe knew that, in spite of his judges and his attorney-general and his\nlegislative lobby and his resourceful lawyers and his subsidized\nnewspapers, a governor of Scarborough's courage and sagacity could\nharass him, could force his tools in public office to activity against\nhim, might drive him from the state.  Heretofore he had felt, and had\nbeen, secure in the might of his millions.  But now--  He had a feeling\nof dread, close kin to fear, as he measured this peril, this man strong\nwith a strength against which money and intrigue were as futile as bow\nand arrow against rifle.\n\nHe opened the door into the room where his twenty personal clerks were\nat work.  They glanced at his face, winced, bent to their tasks. They\nknew that expression: it meant \"J. D. will take the hide off every one\nwho goes near him to-day.\"\n\n\"Tell Mr. Giddings I want to see him,\" he snapped, lifting the head of\nthe nearest clerk with a glance like an electric shock.\n\nThe clerk rose, tiptoed away to the office of the first vice-president\nof the Woolens Trust.  He came tiptoeing back to say in a faint,\ndeprecating voice:  \"Mr. Giddings isn't down yet, sir.\"\n\nDumont rolled out a volley of violent language about Giddings. In his\ntantrums he had no more regard for the dignity of his chief\nlieutenants, themselves rich men and middle-aged or old, than he had\nfor his office boys.  To the Ineffable Grand Turk what noteworthy\ndistinction is there between vizier and sandal-strapper?\n\n\"Send him in--quick,--you, as soon as he comes,\" he shouted in\nconclusion.  If he had not paid generously, if his lieutenants had not\nbeen coining huge dividends out of his brains and commercial audacity,\nif his magnetic, confidence-inspiring personality had not created in\nthe minds of all about him visions of golden rivers widening into\ngolden oceans, he would have been deserted and execrated.  As it was,\nhis service was eagerly sought; and his servants endured its mental and\nmoral hardships as the prospector endures the physical cruelties of the\nmountain fastnesses.\n\nHe was closing his private door when the door-boy from the outermost of\nthat maze of handsome offices came up to him with a card.\n\n\"Not here,\" he growled, and shut himself in.\n\nHalf an hour later the sounds of an angry tumult in the clerks' room\nmade him fling his door open.  \"What the--\" he began, his heavy face\npurple, then stopped amazed.\n\nThe outside doorkeeper, the watchman and several clerks were engaged in\na struggle with Fanshaw.  His hat was off, his hair wild, his necktie,\nshirt and coat awry.\n\n\"There you are now--I knew you were in,\" he shouted, as he caught sight\nof Dumont.  \"Call these curs off, Jack!\"\n\n\"Let him alone,\" snarled Dumont.\n\nFanshaw was released.  He advanced into Dumont's office, straightening\nhis clothing and panting with exertion, excitement and anger.  Dumont\nclosed the door.  \"Well,\" he said surlily. \"What d' you want?\"\n\n\"I'll have to go to the wall at half-past ten if you don't help me\nout,\" said Fanshaw.  \"The Montana election went against my crowd--I'm\nin the copper deal.  There's a slump, but the stock's dead sure to go\nup within a week.\"\n\n\"In trouble again?\" sneered Dumont.  \"It's been only three months since\nI pulled you through.\"\n\n\"You didn't lose anything by it, did you?\" retorted Fanshaw--he had\nrecovered himself and was eying Dumont with the cool, steady,\nsignificant stare of one rascal at another whom he thinks he has in his\npower.\n\nBefore that look Dumont flushed an angrier red.  \"I won't do it again!\"\nand he brought his fist down with a bang.\n\n\"All I want is five hundred thousand to carry my copper for a week at\nthe outside.  If I get it I'll clear a million.  If I don't\"--Fanshaw\nshrugged his shoulders--\"I'll be cleaned out.\" He looked with narrowed,\nshifting eyes at Dumont.  \"My wife has all she's got in this,\" he went\non, \"even her jewels.\"\n\nDumont's look shot straight into Fanshaw's.\n\n\"Not a cent!\" he said with vicious emphasis.  \"Not a red!\"\n\nFanshaw paled and pinched in his lips.  \"I'm a desperate man. I'm\nruined.  Leonora--\"\n\nDumont shook his head, the veins swelling in his forehead and neck.\nThe last strand of his self-restraint snapped.  \"Leave her out of this!\nShe has no claim on me NOW--and YOU never had.\"\n\nFanshaw stared at him, then sprang to his feet, all in a blaze. \"You\nscoundrel!\" he shouted, shaking his fist under Dumont's nose.\n\n\"If you don't clear out instantly I'll have you thrown out,\" said\nDumont.  He was cool and watchful now.\n\nFanshaw folded his arms and looked down at him with the dignified fury\nof the betrayed and outraged.  \"So!\" he exclaimed.  \"I see it all!\"\n\nDumont pressed an electric button, then leaned back in his revolving\nchair and surveyed Fanshaw tranquilly.  \"Not a cent!\" he repeated, a\ncruel smile in his eyes and round his mouth.  The boy came and Dumont\nsaid to him:  \"Send the watchman.\"\n\nFanshaw drew himself up.  \"I shall punish you,\" he said. \"Your wealth\nwill not save you.\"  And he stalked past the gaping office boy.\n\nHe stood in front of the Edison Building, looking aimlessly up and down\nthe street as he pulled his long, narrow, brown-gray mustache.  Gloom\nwas in his face and hate in his heart--not hate for Dumont alone but\nhate for all who were what he longed to be, all rich and \"successful\"\nmen.  And the towering steel and stone palaces of prosperity sneered\ndown on him with crushing mockery.\n\n\"Damn them all!\" he muttered.  \"The cold-hearted thieves!\"\n\nFrom his entry into that district he had played a gambling game, had\nplayed it dishonestly in a small way.  Again and again he had\nsneakingly violated Wall Street's code of morality--that curious code\nwith its quaint, unexpected incorporations of parts of the decalogue\nand its quainter, though not so unexpected, infringements thereof and\namendments thereto.  Now by \"pull,\" now by trickery, he had evaded\npunishment.  But apparently at last he was to be brought to bar,\nbranded and banished.\n\n\"Damn them all!\" he repeated.  \"They're a pack of wolves. They've got\nme down and they're going to eat me.\"\n\nHe blamed Dumont and he blamed his wife for his plight--and there was\nsome justice in both accusations.  Twenty years before, he had come\ndown to \"the Street\" a frank-looking boy, of an old and distinguished\nNew York family that had become too aristocratic for business and had\ntherefore lost its hold upon its once great fortune.  He was neither a\ngood boy nor a bad. But he was weak, and had the extravagant tastes and\ncynical morals to which he had been bred; and his intelligent brain was\nof the kind that goes with weakness--shrewd and sly, preferring to\nslink along the byways of craft even when the highway of courage lies\nstraight and easy.  But he had physical bravery and the self-confidence\nthat is based upon an assured social position in a community where\nsocial position is worshiped; so, he passed for manly and proud when he\nwas in reality neither.  Family vanity he had; personal pride he had\nnot.\n\nIn many environments his weakness would have remained hidden even from\nhimself, and he would have lived and died in the odor and complacence\nof respectability.  But not in the strain and stress of Wall Street.\nThere he had naturally developed not into a lion, not even into a wolf,\nbut into a coyote.\n\nWall Street found him out in ten years--about one year after it began\nto take note of him and his skulking ways and his habit of prowling in\nthe wake of the pack.  Only his adroit use of his family connections\nand social position saved him from being trampled to death by the\nwolves and eaten by his brother coyotes. Thereafter he lived\nprecariously, but on the whole sumptuously, upon carcasses of one kind\nand another.  He participated in \"strike\" suits against big\ncorporations--he would set on a pack of coyotes to dog the lions and to\nraise discordant howls that inopportunely centered public attention\nupon leonine, lawless doings; the lions would pay him well to call off\nthe pack.  He assisted sometimes wolves and sometimes coyotes in\nflotations of worthless, or almost worthless, stocks and bonds from\ngold and mahogany offices and upon a sea of glittering prospectuses.\nHe had a hand in all manner of small, shady transactions of lawful, or\nalmost lawful, swindling that were tolerated by lions and wolves,\nbecause at bottom there is a feeling of fellowship among creatures of\nprey as against creatures preyed upon.\n\nThere were days when he came home haggard and blue in the lips to tell\nLeonora that he must fly.  There were days when he returned from the\nchase, or rather from the skulk, elated, youthful, his pockets full of\nmoney and his imagination afire with hopes of substantial wealth.  But\nhis course was steadily downward, his methods steadily farther and\nfarther from the line of the law. Dumont came just in time to save him,\ncame to build him up from the most shunned of coyotes into a deceptive\nimitation of a wolf with aspirations toward the lion class.\n\nLeonora knew that he was small, but she thought all men small--she had\nsupreme contempt for her own sex; and it seemed to her that men must be\neven less worthy of respect since they were under the influence of\nwomen and lavished time and money on them. Thus she was deceived into\ncherishing the hope that her husband, small and timid though he was,\nwould expand into a multi-millionaire and would help her to possess the\nsplendors she now enjoyed at the expense of her associates whom she\ndespised. She was always thinking how far more impressive than their\nsplendor her magnificence would be, if their money were added to her\nbrains and beauty.\n\nDumont had helped Fanshaw as much as he could.  He immediately detected\nthe coyote.  He knew it was impossible to make a lion or even a wolf\nout of one who was both small and crooked.  He used him only in minor\nmatters, chiefly in doing queer, dark things on the market with\nNational Woolens, things he indirectly ordered done but refused to know\nthe details of beyond the one important detail--the record of checks\nfor the profits in his bank account. For such matters Fanshaw did as\nwell as another.  But as Dumont became less of a wolf and more of a\nlion, less of a speculator and more of a financier, he had less and\nless work of the kind Fanshaw could do.\n\nBut Leonora, unaware of her husband's worthlessness and desperate in\nher calamities, sneered and jeered and lashed him on--to ruin. The\ncoyote could put on the airs of a lion so long as the lion was his\nfriend and protector; when he kept on in kingly ways after the lion had\ncast him off, he speedily came to grief.\n\nAs he stood looking helplessly up and down Broad Street he was debating\nwhat move to make.  There were about even measures of truth and\nfalsehood in his statement to Dumont--he did need two hundred thousand\ndollars; and he must have it before a quarter past two that day or go\ninto a bankruptcy from which he could not hope to save a shred of\nreputation or to secrete more than fifty thousand dollars.\n\n\"To the New York Life Building,\" he finally said to the driver as he\ngot into his hansom.  Then to himself:  \"I'll have a go at old Herron.\"\n\nHe knew that Dumont and Herron had quarreled, and that Herron had sold\nout of the National Woolens Company.  But he did not know that Herron\nwas a man with a fixed idea, hatred of Dumont, and a fixed purpose, to\ndamage him at every opportunity that offered or could be created, to\nruin him if possible.\n\nWhen the National Woolens Company was expanded into the huge\nconglomerate it now was--a hundred millions common, a hundred millions\npreferred, and twenty millions of bonds--Herron had devised and\ndirected the intricate and highly perilous course among the rocks of\nlaw and public opinion in many states and in the nation.  It was a\nsplendid exhibition of legal piloting, and he was bitterly dissatisfied\nwith the modest reward of ten millions of the preferred stock which\nDumont apportioned to him. He felt that that would have been about his\njust share in the new concern merely in exchange for his stock in the\nold.  When he found Dumont obdurate, and grew frank and spoke such\nwords as \"dishonor\" and \"dishonesty\" and got into the first syllable of\n\"swindling,\" Dumont cut him off with--\n\n\"If you don't like it, get out!  I can hire that sort of work for half\nwhat I've paid you.  You're swollen with vanity.  We ought to have a\nyoung man in your position, anyhow.\"\n\nHerron might have swallowed the insult to his pride as a lawyer. But\nthe insult to his pride in his youth!  He was fifty-seven and in dress\nand in expression was stoutly insisting that he was still a young man\nwhom hard work had made prematurely gray and somewhat wrinkled.\nDumont's insinuation that he was old and stale set a great fire of hate\nblazing; he, of course, told himself and others that his wrath was\nstirred solely because his sense of justice had been outraged by the\n\"swindling.\"\n\nFanshaw entered Herron's office wearing the jaunty air of arrogant\nprosperity, never so important as when prosperity has fled.  But\nHerron's shrewd, experienced eyes penetrated the sham. He had intended\nto be cold.  Scenting a \"hard-luck yarn\" and a \"touch\" he lowered his\ntemperature to the point at which conversation is ice-beset and\nconfidences are frozen tight.\n\nFanshaw's nerve deserted him.  \"Herron,\" he said, dropping his\nprosperous pose, \"I want to get a divorce and I want to punish Dumont.\"\n\nHerron's narrow, cold face lighted up.  He knew what everybody in their\nset knew of Fanshaw's domestic affairs, but like everybody else he had\npretended not to know.  He changed his expression to one of shock and\nindignation.\n\n\"You astound me!\" he exclaimed.  \"It is incredible!\"\n\n\"He told me himself not an hour ago,\" said Fanshaw.  \"I went to him as\na friend to ask him to help me out of a hole.  And--\" He rose and\ntheatrically paced the floor.\n\nHerron prided himself upon his acute conscience and his nice sense of\nhonor.  He felt that here was a chance to wreak vengeance upon\nDumont--or rather, as he put it to himself, to bring Dumont to an\naccounting for his depravity.  Just as Dumont maintained with himself a\ncharacter of honesty by ignoring all the dubious acts which his agents\nwere forced to do in carrying out his orders, so Herron kept peace with\na far more sensitive conscience by never permitting it to look in upon\nhis mind or out through his eyes.\n\n\"Frightful!  Frightful!\" he exclaimed, after a long pause in which his\nimmured and blindfold conscience decided that he could afford to\nsupport Fanshaw.  \"I knew he was a rascal in business--but THIS!\"\n\nThere was genuine emotion in his voice and in his mind.  He was strict\nto puritanic primness in his ideals of feminine morality; nor had he\nbeen relaxed by having a handsome wife, looking scarce a day over\nthirty behind her veil or in artificial light, and fond of gathering\nabout her young men who treated him as if he were old and \"didn't\ncount.\"\n\n\"You are certain, Fanshaw?\"\n\n\"I tell you, he hinted it himself,\" replied Fanshaw.  \"And instantly my\neyes were opened to scores of damning confirmations.\"  He struck his\nforehead with his open hand. \"How blind I've been!\" he exclaimed.\n\nHerron shook his head sympathetically and hastened on to business.\n\n\"WE can't handle your case,\" he said.  \"But Best and Sharpless, on the\nfloor above, are reliable.  And I'll be glad to help you with advice.\nI feel that this is the beginning of Dumont's end.  I knew such\ninsolent wickedness could not have a long course.\"\n\nFanshaw drew Herron on to tell the story of his wrongs--the\n\"swindling.\"  Before it was ended Fanshaw saw that he had found a man\nwho hated Dumont malignantly and was thirsting for vengeance.  This\nencouraged him to unfold his financial difficulties.  Herron listened\nsympathetically, asked ingeniously illuminating questions, and in the\nend agreed to tide him over. He had assured himself that Fanshaw had\nsimply undertaken too large an enterprise; the advance would be well\nsecured; he would make the loan in such a way that he would get a sure\nprofit, and would also bind Fanshaw firmly to him without binding\nhimself to Fanshaw.  Besides--\"It wouldn't do for him to go to the wall\njust now.\"\n\nArm in arm they went up to Best and Sharpless' to take the first steps\nin the suit.  Together they went down-town to relieve Fanshaw of the\npressure of the too heavy burden of copper stocks; then up to their\nclub where he assisted Fanshaw in composing the breaking-off letter to\nLeonora.\n\n\n\nXXII.\n\nSTORMS IN THE WEST.\n\nWhile the Fanshaw-Herron storm was slowly gathering in Dumont's eastern\nhorizon, two others equally black were lifting in the west.\n\nIn the two months between Scarborough's election and his inauguration,\nthe great monopolies thriving under the protection of the state's\ncorrupted statute-book and corrupted officials followed the lead of\ntheir leader, Dumont's National Woolens Company, in making sweeping but\nstealthy changes in their prices, wages, methods and even in their\nlegal status.  They hoped thus to enable their Legislature plausibly to\nresist Scarborough's demand for a revision of the laws--why revise when\nthe cry of monopoly had been shown to be a false issue raised by a\ndemagogue to discredit the tried leaders of the party and to aggrandize\nhimself?  And, when Scarborough had been thoroughly \"exposed,\" business\ncould be resumed gradually.\n\nBut Scarborough had the better brain, and had character as well. He\neasily upset their program and pressed their Legislature so hard that\nit was kept in line only by pouring out money like water.  This became\na public scandal which made him stronger than ever and also made it\nseem difficult or impossible for the monopolies to get a corruptible\nLegislature at the next election. At last the people had in their\nservice a lawyer equal in ability to the best the monopolies could buy,\nand one who understood human nature and political machinery to boot.\n\nDumont began to respect Scarborough profoundly--not for his character,\nwhich made him impregnable with the people, but for his intellect,\nwhich showed him how to convince the people of his character and to\nkeep them convinced.  When Merriweather came on \"to take his beating\"\nfrom his employer he said among other things deprecatory:\n\"Scarborough's a dreamer.  His head's among the clouds.\"  Dumont\nretorted:  \"Yes, but his feet are on the ground--too damned firmly to\nsuit me.\"  And after a moment's thought, he added:  \"What a shame for\nsuch a brain to go to waste!  Why, he could make millions.\"\n\nHe felt that Gladys was probably his best remaining card.  She had been\nin Indianapolis visiting the whole of February, Scarborough's second\nmonth as governor, and had gone on to her brother in New York with a\nglowing report of her progress with Scarborough's sister Arabella, now\na widow and at her own invitation living with him in Indianapolis to\nrelieve him of the social duties of his office.  She was a dozen years\nmore the Arabella who had roused her father's wrath by her plans for\neducating her brother \"like a gentleman\"; and Olivia and Fred were\nirritated and even alarmed by her anything but helpful\npeculiarities--though Scarborough seemed cheerful and indifferent\nenough about them.\n\nIt was a temperamental impossibility for Dumont to believe that\nScarborough could really be sincere in a course which was obviously\nunprofitable.  Therefore he attached even more importance to Arabella's\ncordiality than did Gladys herself. And, when the Legislature adjourned\nand Scarborough returned to Saint X for a brief stay, Dumont sent\nGladys post-haste back to the Eyrie--that is, she instantly and eagerly\nacted upon his hint.\n\nA few evenings after her return, she and Pauline were on the south\nveranda alone in the starlight.  She was in low spirits and presently\nbegan to rail against her lot.\n\n\"Don't be absurd,\" said Pauline.  \"You've no right to complain.  You\nhave everything--and you're--free!\"\n\nThat word \"free\" was often on Pauline's lips in those days. And a close\nobserver might have been struck by the tone in which she uttered it.\nNot the careless tone of those who have never had or have never lost\nfreedom, but the lingering, longing tone of those who have had it, and\nhave learned to value it through long years without it.\n\n\"Yes--everything!\" replied Gladys, bitterly.  \"Everything except the\none thing I want.\"\n\nPauline did not help her, but she was at the stage of suppressed\nfeeling where desire to confide is stronger than pride.\n\n\"The one thing I want,\" she repeated.  \"Pauline, I used to think I'd\nnever care much for any man, except to like it for him to like me.  Men\nhave always been a sort of amusement--and the oftener the man changed,\nthe better the fun.  I've known for several years that I simply must\nmarry, but I've refused to face it.  It seemed to me I was fated to\nwander the earth, homeless, begging from door to door for leave to come\nin and rest a while.\"\n\n\"You know perfectly well, Gladys, that this is your home.\"\n\n\"Of course--in a sense.  It's as much my home as another woman's house\ncould be.  But\"--with a little sob--\"I've seen my mate and I want to\nbegin my nest.\"\n\nThey were side by side on a wide, wicker sofa.  Pauline made an\nimpulsive move to put her arm round Gladys, then drew away and clasped\nher hands tightly in her lap.\n\nGladys was crying, sobbing, brokenly apologizing for it--\"I'm a little\nidiot--but I can't help it--I haven't any pride left--a woman never\ndoes have, really, when she's in love--oh, Pauline, do you think he\ncares at all for me?\"  And after a pause she went on, too absorbed in\nherself to observe Pauline or to wonder at her silence:  \"Sometimes I\nthink he does.  Again I fear that--that he doesn't.  And lately--why\ndoesn't he come here any more?\"\n\n\"You know how busy he is,\" said Pauline, in a voice so strained that\nGladys ought to have noticed it.\n\n\"But it isn't that--I'm sure it isn't.  No, it has something to do with\nme.  It means either that he doesn't care for me or that--that he does\ncare and is fighting against it.  Oh, I don't know what to think.\"\nThen, after a pause:  \"How I hate being a woman!  If I were a man I\ncould find out the truth--settle it one way or the other.  But I must\nsit dumb and wait, and wait, and wait!  You don't know how I love him,\"\nshe said brokenly, burying her face in the ends of the soft white shawl\nthat was flung about her bare shoulders.  \"I can't help it--he's the\nbest--he makes all the others look and talk like cheap imitations.\nHe's the best, and a woman can't help wanting the best.\"\n\nPauline rose and leaned against the railing--she could evade the truth\nno longer.  Gladys was in love with Scarborough, was at last caught in\nher own toils, would go on entangling herself deeper and deeper,\nabandoning herself more and more to a hopeless love, unless--\n\n\"What would you do, Pauline?\" pleaded Gladys.  \"There must be some\nreason why he doesn't speak.  It isn't fair to me--it isn't fair!  I\ncould stand anything--even giving him up--better than this uncertainty.\nIt's--it's breaking my heart--I who thought I didn't have a heart.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't fair,\" said Pauline, to herself rather than to Gladys.\n\n\"I suppose you don't sympathize with me,\" Gladys went on.  \"I know you\ndon't like him.  I've noticed how strained and distant you are toward\neach other.  And you seem to avoid each other. And he'll never talk of\nyou to me.  Did you have some sort of misunderstanding at college?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pauline, slowly.  \"A--a misunderstanding.\"\n\n\"And you both remember it, after all these years?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pauline.\n\n\"How relentless you are,\" said Gladys, \"and how tenacious!\" But she was\ntoo intent upon her own affairs to pursue a subject which seemed to\nlead away from them.  Presently she rose.\n\n\"I'll be ashamed of having confessed when I see you in daylight. But I\ndon't care.  I shan't be sorry.  I feel a little better. After all, why\nshould I be ashamed of any one knowing I care for him?\"  And she\nsighed, laughed, went into the house, whistling softly--sad, depressed,\nbut hopeful, feeling deep down that she surely must win where she had\nnever known what it was to lose.\n\nPauline looked after her.  \"No, it isn't fair,\" she repeated. She\nstayed on the veranda, walking slowly to and fro not to make up her\nmind, for she had done that while Gladys was confessing, but to decide\nhow she could best accomplish what she saw she must now no longer\ndelay.  It was not until two hours later that she went up to bed.\n\nWhen Gladys came down at nine the next morning Pauline had just gone\nout--\"I think, Miss Gladys, she told the coachman to drive to her\nfather's,\" said the butler.\n\nGladys set out alone.  Instead of keeping to the paths and the woods\nalong the edge of the bluff she descended to the valley and the river\nroad.  She walked rapidly, her face glowing, her eyes sparkling--she\nwas quick to respond to impressions through the senses, and to-day she\nfelt so well physically that it reacted upon her mind and forced her\nspirits up.  At the turn beyond Deer Creek bridge she met Scarborough\nsuddenly.  He, too, was afoot and alone, and his greeting was\ninterpreted to her hopes by her spirits.\n\n\"May I turn and walk with you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'm finding myself disagreeable company today.\"\n\n\"You did look dull,\" she said, as they set out together, \"dull as a\nlove-sick German.  But I supposed it was your executive pose.\"\n\n\"I was thinking that I'll be old before I know it.\"  His old-young face\nwas shadowed for an instant.  \"Old--that's an unpleasant thought, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Unpleasant for a man,\" said Gladys, with a laugh, light as youth's\ndread of age.  \"For a woman, ghastly!  Old and alone--either one's\ndreadful enough.  But--the two together!  I often think of them.  Don't\nlaugh at me--really I do.  Don't you?\"\n\n\"If you keep to that, our walk'll be a dismal failure.  It's a road I\nnever take--if I can help it.\"\n\n\"You don't look as though you were ever gloomy.\"  Gladys glanced up at\nhim admiringly.  \"I should have said you were one person the blue\ndevils wouldn't dare attack.\"\n\n\"Yes, but they do.  And sometimes they throw me.\"\n\n\"And trample you?\"\n\n\"And trample me,\" he answered absently.\n\n\"That's because you're alone too much,\" she said with a look of tactful\nsympathy.\n\n\"Precisely,\" he replied.  \"But how am I to prevent that?\"\n\n\"Marry, of course,\" she retorted, smiling gaily up at him, letting her\nheart just peep from her eyes.\n\n\"Thank you!  And it sounds so easy!  May I ask why you've refused to\ntake your own medicine--you who say you are so often blue?\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.  \"I've always suspected the men who asked\nme.  They were--\"  She did not finish what she feared might be an\nunwise, repelling remark in the circumstances.\n\n\"They were after your money,\" he finished for her.\n\nShe nodded.  \"They were Europeans,\" she explained.  \"Europeans want\nmoney when they marry.\"\n\n\"That's another of the curses of riches,\" he said judicially. \"And if\nyou marry a rich man over here, you may be pretty sure he'll marry you\nfor your money.  I've observed that rich men attach an exaggerated\nimportance to money, always.\"\n\n\"I'd prefer to marry a poor man,\" she hastened to answer, her heart\nbeating faster--certainly his warning against rich suitors must have\nbeen designed to help his own cause with her.\n\n\"Yes, that might be better,\" he agreed.  \"But you would have to be\ncareful after you were married or he might fancy you were using your\nmoney to tyrannize over him.  I've noticed that the poor husbands of\nrich women are supersensitive--often for cause.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd give it all to him.  He could do what he pleased with it.  I'd\nnot care so long as we were happy.\"\n\nScarborough liked the spirit of this, liked her look as she said it.\n\n\"That's very generous--very like you,\" he replied warmly. \"But I don't\nthink it would be at all wise.  You'd be in a dangerous position.  You\nmight spoil him--great wealth is a great danger, and when it's suddenly\nacquired, and so easily--  No, you'd better put your wealth aside and\nonly use so much of it as will make your income equal to his--if you\ncan stand living economically.\"\n\n\"I could stand anything with or from any one I cared for.\" Gladys was\neager for the conversation to turn from the general to the particular.\nShe went on, forcing her voice to hide her interest:  \"And you, why\ndon't you cure your blues?\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall,\" he replied carelessly.  \"But not with your medicine.\nEvery one to his own prescription.\"\n\n\"And what's yours for yourself?\" said Gladys, feeling tired and nervous\nfrom the strain of this delayed happiness.\n\n\"Mine?\" He laughed.  \"My dreams.\"\n\n\"You are a strange combination, aren't you?  In one way you're so very\npractical--with your politics and all that.  And in another way--I\nsuspect you of being sentimental--almost romantic.\"\n\n\"You've plucked out the heart of my mystery.  My real name is non\nQuixote de Saint X.\"\n\n\"And has your Dulcinea red hands and a flat nose and freckles like the\nlady of Toboso?\"  Gladys' hands were white, her nose notably fine, her\nskin transparently clear.\n\n\"Being Don Quixote, I don't know it if she has.\"\n\n\"And you prefer to worship afar, and to send her news of your triumphs\ninstead of going to her yourself?\"\n\n\"I dare not go.\"  He was looking away, far away.  \"There are wicked\nenchanters.  I'm powerless.  She alone can break their spells.\"\n\nThey walked in silence, her heart beating so loudly that she thought he\nmust be hearing it, must be hearing what it was saying.  Yes--she must\nbreak the spells.  But how--but how?  What must she say to make him\nsee?  Did he expect her to ask him to marry her?  She had heard that\nrich women often were forced to make this concession to the pride of\nthe men they wished to marry.  On the other hand, was there ever a man\nless likely than Scarborough to let any obstacle stand between him and\nwhat he wanted?\n\nThe first huge drops of a summer rain pattered in big, round stains,\nbrown upon the white of the road.  He glanced up--a cloud was rolling\nfrom beyond the cliffs, was swiftly curtaining the blue.\n\n\"Come,\" he commanded, and they darted into the underbrush, he guiding\nher by her arm.  A short dash among the trees and bushes and they were\nat the base of the bluff, were shielded by a shelf of rock.\n\n\"It'll be over soon,\" he assured her.  \"But you must stand close or\nyou'll be drenched.\"\n\nA clap of thunder deafened them as a flame and a force enswathed the\nsycamore tree a few yards away, blowing off its bark, scattering its\nbranches, making it all in an instant a blackened and blasted wreck.\nGladys gave a low scream of terror, fell against him, hid her face in\nhis shoulder.  She was trembling violently.  He put his arm round\nher--if he had not supported her she would have fallen.  She leaned\nagainst him, clinging to him, so that he felt the beat of her heart,\nthe swell and fall of her bosom, felt the rush of her young blood\nthrough her veins, felt the thrill from her smooth, delicate, olive\nskin.  And he, too, was trembling--shaken in all his nerves.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" he said--in his voice he unconsciously betrayed the\nimpulse that was fighting for possession of him.\n\nShe drew herself closer to him with a long, tremulous sigh.\n\n\"I'm a coward,\" she murmured.  \"I'm shaking so that I can't stand.\"\nShe tried to draw herself away--or did she only make pretense to him\nand to herself that she was trying?--then relaxed again into his arms.\n\nThe thunder cracked and crashed; the lightnings leaped in streaks and\nin sheets; the waters gushed from the torn clouds and obscured the\nlight like a heavy veil.  She looked up at him in the dimness--she,\ntoo, was drunk with the delirium of the storms raging without and\nwithin them.  His brain swam giddily.  The points of gold in her dark\neyes were drawing him like so many powerful magnets.  Their lips met\nand he caught her up in his arms.  And for a moment all the fire of his\nintensely masculine nature, so long repressed, raged over her lips, her\neyes, her hair, her cheeks, her chin.\n\nA moment she lay, happy as a petrel, beaten by a tempest; a moment her\nthirsty heart drank in the ecstasy of the lightnings through her lips\nand skin and hair.\n\nShe opened her eyes to find out why there was a sudden calm.  She saw\nhim staring with set, white face through the rain-veil.  His arms still\nheld her, but where they had been like the clasp of life itself, they\nwere now dead as the arms of a statue.  A feeling of cold chilled her\nskin, trickled icily in and in.  She released herself--he did not\noppose her.\n\n\"It seems to me I'll never be able to look you--or myself--in the face\nagain,\" he said at last.\n\n\"I didn't know it was in me to--to take advantage of a woman's\nhelplessness.\"\n\n\"I wanted you to do what you did,\" she said simply.\n\nHe shook his head.  \"You are generous,\" he answered.  \"But I deserve\nnothing but your contempt.\"\n\n\"I wanted you to do it,\" she repeated.  She was under the spell of her\nlove and of his touch.  She was clutching to save what she could, was\ndesperately hoping it might not be so little as she feared.  \"I had\nthe--the same impulse that you had.\"  She looked at him timidly, with a\npleading smile.  \"And please don't say you're sorry you did it, even if\nyou feel so.  You'll think me very bold--I know it isn't proper for\nyoung women to make such admissions.  But--don't reproach\nyourself--please!\"\n\nIf she could have looked into his mind as he stood there, crushed and\ndegraded in his own eyes, she would have been a little consoled--for,\nin defiance of his self-scorn and self-hate, his nerves were tingling\nwith the memory of that delirium, and his brain was throbbing with the\nsurge of impulses long dormant, now imperious.  But she was not even\nlooking toward him--for, through her sense of shame, of wounded pride,\nher love was clamoring to her to cry out:  \"Take me in your arms again!\nI care not on what terms, only take me and hold me and kiss me.\"\n\nThe rain presently ceased as abruptly as it had begun and they returned\nunder the dripping leaves to the highroad.  She glanced anxiously at\nhim as they walked toward the town, but he did not speak.  She saw that\nif the silence was to be broken, she must break it.\n\n\"What can I say to convince you?\" she asked, as if not he but she were\nthe offender.\n\nHe did not answer.\n\n\"Won't you look at me, please?\"\n\nHe looked, the color mounting in his cheeks, his eyes unsteady.\n\n\"Now, tell me you'll not make me suffer because you fancy you've\nwronged me.  Isn't it ungallant of you to act this way after I've\nhumiliated myself to confess I didn't mind?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said humbly, and looked away.\n\n\"You won't have it that I was in the least responsible?\"  She was\nteasing him now--he was plainly unaware of the meaning of her yielding.\n\"He's so modest,\" she thought, and went on:  \"You won't permit me to\nflatter myself I was a temptation too strong even for your iron heart,\nDon Quixote?\"\n\nHe flushed scarlet, and the suspicion, the realization of the truth set\nher eyes to flashing.\n\n\"It's before another woman he's abasing himself,\" she thought, \"not\nbefore me.  He isn't even thinking of me.\"  When she spoke her tone was\ncold and sneering:  \"I hope she will forgive you. She certainly would\nif she could know what a paladin you are.\"\n\nHe winced, but did not answer.  At the road up the bluffs she paused\nand there was an embarrassed silence.  Then he poured out abrupt\nsentences:\n\n\"It was doubly base.  I betrayed your friendly trust, I was false to\nher.  Don't misunderstand--she's nothing to me.  She's nothing to me,\nyet everything.  I began really to live when I began to love her.\nAnd--every one must have a--a pole-star.  And she's mine--the star I\nsail by, and always must.  And--\"  He halted altogether, then blundered\non:  \"I shall not forgive myself.  But you--be merciful--forgive\nme--forget it!\"\n\n\"I shall do neither,\" she replied curtly, jealousy and vanity stamping\ndown the generous impulse that rose in response to his appeal.  And she\nwent up her road.  A few yards and she paused, hoping to hear him\ncoming after her.  A few yards more and she sat down on a big boulder\nby the wayside.  Until now all the wishes of her life had been more or\nless material, had been wishes which her wealth or the position her\nwealth gave had enabled her instantly to gratify.  She buried her face\nin her arms and sobbed and rocked herself to and fro, in a cyclone of\nanger, and jealousy, and shame, and love, and despair.\n\n\"I hate him!\" she exclaimed between clenched teeth.  \"I hate him,\nbut--if he came and wanted me, oh, how I would LOVE him!\"\n\nMeanwhile Pauline was at her father's.\n\n\"He isn't down yet,\" said her mother.  \"You know, he doesn't finish\ndressing nowadays until he has read the papers and his mail.  Then he\nwalks in the garden.\"\n\n\"I'll go there,\" said Pauline.  \"Won't you bring him when he's ready?\"\n\nShe never entered the garden that the ghosts of her childhood--how far,\nfar it seemed!--did not join her, brushing against her, or rustling in\ntree and bush and leafy trellis.  She paused at the end of the long\narbor and sat on the rustic bench there.  A few feet away was the bed\nof lilies-of-the-valley. Every spring of her childhood she used to run\nfrom the house on the first warm morning and hurry to it; and if her\nglance raised her hopes she would kneel upon the young grass and lower\nher head until her long golden hair touched the black ground; and the\nsoil that had been hard and cold all winter would be cracked open this\nway and that; and from the cracks would issue an odor--the odor of\nlife.  And as she would peer into each crack in turn she would see,\ndown, away down, the pale tip of what she knew to be an up-shooting\nslender shaft.  And her heart would thrill with joy, for she knew that\nthe shafts would presently rise green above the black earth, would\nunfold, would blossom, would bloom, would fling from tremulous bells a\nperfumed proclamation of the arrival of spring.\n\nAs she sat waiting, it seemed to her that through the black earth of\nher life she could see and feel the backward heralds of her\nspring--\"after the long winter,\" she said to herself.\n\nShe glanced up--her father coming toward her.  He was alone, was\nholding a folded letter uncertainly in his hand.  He looked at her, his\neyes full of pity and grief.  \"Pauline,\" he began, \"has everything\nbeen--been well--of late between you and--your husband?\"\n\nShe started.  \"No, father,\" she replied.  Then, looking at him with\nclear directness:  \"I've not been showing you and mother the truth\nabout John and me--not for a long time.\"\n\nShe saw that her answer relieved him.  He hesitated, held out the\nletter.\n\n\"The best way is for you to read it,\" he said.  It was a letter to him\nfrom Fanshaw.  He was writing, he explained, because the discharge of a\npainful duty to himself would compel him \"to give pain to your daughter\nwhom I esteem highly,\" and he thought it only right \"to prepare her and\nher family for what was coming, in order that they might be ready to\ntake the action that would suggest itself.\"  And he went on to relate\nhis domestic troubles and his impending suit.\n\n\"Poor Leonora!\" murmured Pauline, as she finished and sat thinking of\nall that Fanshaw's letter involved.\n\n\"Is it true, Polly?\" asked her father.\n\nShe gave a great sigh of relief.  How easy this letter had made all\nthat she had been dreading!  \"Yes--it's true,\" she replied. \"I've known\nabout--about it ever since the time I came back from the East and\ndidn't return.\"\n\nThe habitual pallor of her father's face changed to gray.\n\n\"I left him, father.\"  She lifted her head, impatient of her\nstammering.  A bright flush was in her face as she went on rapidly:\n\"And I came to-day to tell you the whole story--to be truthful and\nhonest again.  I'm sick of deception and evasion.  I can't stand it any\nlonger--I mustn't.  I--you don't know how I've shrunk from wounding\nmother and you.  But I've no choice now. Father, I must be free--free!\"\n\n\"And you shall be,\" replied her father.  \"He shall not wreck your life\nand Gardiner's.\"\n\nPauline stared at him.  \"Father!\" she exclaimed.\n\nHe put his arm round her and drew her gently to him.\n\n\"I know the idea is repellent,\" he said, as if he were trying to\npersuade a child.  \"But it's right, Pauline.  There are cases in which\nnot to divorce would be a sin.  I hope my daughter sees that this is\none.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said confusedly.  \"I thought you and mother\nbelieved divorce was dreadful--no matter what might happen.\"\n\n\"We did, Pauline.  But we--that is, I--had never had it brought home.\nA hint of this story was published just after you came last year.  I\nthought it false, but it set me to thinking.  'If your daughter's\nhusband had turned out to be as you once thought him, would it be right\nfor her to live on with him?  To live a lie, to pretend to keep her\nvows to love and honor him?  Would it be right to condemn Gardiner to\nbe poisoned by such a father?' And at last I saw the truth, and your\nmother agreed with me.  We had been too narrow.  We had been laying\ndown our own notions as God's great justice.\"\n\nPauline drew away from her father so that she could look at him. And at\nlast she saw into his heart.  \"If I had only known,\" she said, and sat\nnumb and stunned.\n\n\"When you were coming home from college,\" her father went on, \"your\nmother and I talked over what we should do.  John had just confessed\nyour secret marriage--\"\n\n\"You knew that!\"\n\n\"Yes, and we understood, Polly.  You were so young--so headstrong--and\nyou couldn't appreciate our reasons.\"\n\nPauline's brain was reeling.\n\n\"Your mother and I talked it over before you got home and thought it\nbest to leave you entirely free to choose.  But when we saw you\novercome by joy--\"\n\n\"Don't!\" she interrupted, her voice a cry of pain.  \"I can't bear it!\nDon't!\"  Years of false self-sacrifice, of deceiving her parents and\nher child, of self-suppression and self-degradation, and this final\ncruelty to Gladys--all, all in vain, all a heaping of folly upon folly,\nof wrong upon wrong.\n\nShe rushed toward the house.  She must fly somewhere--anywhere--to\nescape the thoughts that were picking with sharp beaks at her aching\nheart.  Half-way up the walk she turned and fled to a refuge she would\nnot have thought of half an hour before to her father's arms.\n\n\"Oh, father,\" she cried.  \"If I had only known you!\"\n\n\nGladys, returning from her walk, went directly to Pauline's\nsitting-room.\n\n\"I'm off for New York and Europe to-morrow morning,\" she began\nabruptly, her voice hard, her expression bitter and reckless.\n\n\"Where can she have heard about Leonora?\" thought Pauline.  She said in\na strained voice:  \"I had hoped you would stay here to look after the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"To look after the house?  What do you mean?\" asked Gladys. But she was\ntoo full of herself to be interested in the answer, and went on:  \"I\nwant you to forget what I said to you.  I've got over all that.  I've\ncome to my senses.\"\n\nPauline began a nervous turning of her rings.\n\nGladys gave a short, grim laugh.  \"I detest him,\" she went on. \"We're\nvery changeable, we women, aren't we?  I went out of this house two\nhours ago loving him--to distraction.  I came back hating him.  And all\nthat has happened in between is that I met him and he kissed me a few\ntimes and stabbed my pride a few times.\"\n\nPauline stopped turning her rings--she rose slowly, mechanically,\nlooked straight at Gladys.\n\n\"That is not true,\" she said calmly.\n\nGladys laughed sardonically.  \"You don't know the cold and haughty\nGovernor Scarborough.  There's fire under the ice.  I can feel the\nplaces on my face where it scorched.  Can't you see them?\"\n\nPauline gave her a look of disgust.  \"How like John Dumont's sister!\"\nshe thought.  And she shut herself in her room and stayed there,\npleading illness in excuse, until Gladys was gone.\n\n\n\nXXIII.\n\nA SEA SURPRISE.\n\nOn the third day from New York, Gladys was so far recovered from\nseasickness that she dragged herself to the deck.  The water was fairly\nsmooth, but a sticky, foggy rain was falling.  A deck-steward put her\nsteamer-chair in a sheltered corner.  Her maid and a stewardess swathed\nher in capes and rugs; she closed her eyes and said:  \"Now leave me,\nplease, and don't come near me till I send for you.\"\n\nShe slept an hour.  When she awoke she felt better.  Some one had drawn\na chair beside hers and was seated there--a man, for she caught the\nfaint odor of a pipe, though the wind was the other way.  She turned\nher head.  It was Langdon, whom she had not seen since she went below a\nfew hours after Sandy Hook disappeared. Indeed, she had almost\nforgotten that he was on board and that her brother had asked him to\nlook after her.  He was staring at her in an absent-minded way, his\nwonted expression  of satire and lazy good-humor fainter than usual.\nIn fact, his face was almost serious.\n\n\"That pipe,\" she grumbled.  \"Please do put it away.\"\n\nHe tossed it into the sea.  \"Beg pardon,\" he said.  \"It was stupid of\nme.  I was absorbed in--in my book.\"\n\n\"What's the name of it?\"\n\nHe turned it to glance at the cover, but she went on: \"No--don't tell\nme.  I've no desire to know.  I asked merely to confirm my suspicion.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" he said.  \"I wasn't reading.  I was looking at you.\"\n\n\"That was impertinent.  A man should not look at a woman when she\ndoesn't intend him to look.\"\n\n\"Then I'd never look at all.  I'm interested only in things not meant\nfor my eyes.  I might even read letters not addressed to me if I didn't\nknow how dull letters are.  No intelligent person ever says anything in\na letter nowadays.  They use the telegraph for ordinary correspondence,\nand telepathy for the other kind. But it was interesting--looking at\nyou as you lay asleep.\"\n\n\"Was my mouth open?\"\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"Am I yellow?\"\n\n\"Very.\"\n\n\"Eyes red?  Hair in strings?  Lips blue?\"\n\n\"All that,\" he said, \"and skin somewhat mottled.  But I was not so much\ninterested in your beauty as I was in trying to determine whether you\nwere well enough to stand two shocks.\"\n\n\"I need them,\" replied Gladys.\n\n\"One is rather unpleasant, the other--the reverse, in fact a happiness.\"\n\n\"The unpleasant first, please.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" he replied.  \"Always the medicine first, then the candy.\"\nAnd he leaned back and closed his eyes and seemed to be settling\nhimself for indefinite silence.\n\n\"Go on,\" she said impatiently.  \"What's the medicine?  A death?\"\n\n\"I said unpleasant, didn't I?  When an enemy dies it's all joy. When a\nfriend passes over to eternal bliss, why, being good Christians, we are\nnot so faithless and selfish as to let the momentary separation\ndistress us.\"\n\n\"But what is it?  You're trying to gain time by all this beating about\nthe bush.  You ought to know me well enough to know you can speak\nstraight out.\"\n\n\"Fanshaw's suing his wife for divorce--and he names Jack.\"\n\n\"Is that your news?\" said Gladys, languidly.  Suddenly she flung aside\nthe robes and sat up.\n\n\"What's Pauline going to do?  Can she--\" Gladys paused.\n\n\"Yes, she can--if she wishes to.\"\n\n\"But--will she?  Will she?\" demanded Gladys.\n\n\"Jack doesn't know what she'll do,\" replied Langdon.  \"He's keeping\nquiet--the only sane course when that kind of storm breaks.  He had\nhoped you'd be there to smooth her down, but he says when he opened the\nsubject of your going back to Saint X you cut him off.\"\n\n\"Does she know?\"\n\n\"Somebody must have told her the day you left.  Don't you remember, she\nwas taken ill suddenly?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Gladys vividly recalled Pauline's strange look and manner.  She\ncould see her sister-in-law--the long, lithe form, the small, graceful\nhead, with its thick, soft, waving hair, the oval face, the skin as\nfine as the petals at the heart of a rose, the arched brows and\ngolden-brown eyes; that look, that air, as of buoyant life locked in\nthe spell of an icy trance, mysterious, fascinating, sometimes so\nmelancholy.\n\n\"I almost hope she'll do it, Mowbray,\" she said.  \"Jack doesn't deserve\nher.  He's not a bit her sort.  She ought to have married--\"\n\n\"Some one who had her sort of ideals--some one like that big, handsome\nchap--the one you admired so frantically--Governor Scarborough.  He was\nchock full of ideals.  And he's making the sort of career she could\nsympathize with.\"\n\n\"Scarborough!\" exclaimed Gladys, with some success at self-concealment.\n\"I detest him!  I detest 'careers'!\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Langdon, his face serious, his eyes amused. \"That opens\nthe way for my other shock.\"\n\n\"Oh, the good news.  What is it?\"\n\n\"That I'd like it if you'd marry me.\"\n\nGladys glanced into his still amused eyes, then with a shrug sank back\namong her wraps.  \"A poor joke,\" she said.\n\n\"I should say that marriage was a stale joke rather than a poor one.\nWill you try it--with me?  You might do worse.\"\n\n\"How did you have the courage to speak when I'm looking such a wreck?\"\nshe asked with mock gravity.\n\n\"But you ain't--you're looking better now.  That first shock braced you\nup.  Besides, this isn't romance.  It's no high flight with all the\nlonger drop and all the harder jolt at the landing. It's a plain,\npractical proposition.\"\n\nGladys slowly sat up and studied him curiously.\n\n\"Do you really mean it?\" she asked.  Each was leaning on an elbow,\ngazing gravely into the other's face.\n\n\"I'd never joke on such a dangerous subject as marriage.  I'm far too\ntimid for that.  What do you say, Gladys?\"\n\nShe had never seen him look serious before, and she was thinking that\nthe expression became him.\n\n\"He knows how to make himself attractive to a woman when he cares to,\"\nshe said to herself.\n\n\"I'd like a man that has lightness of mind.  Serious people bore one so\nafter a while.\"  By \"serious people\" she meant one serious person whom\nshe had admired particularly for his seriousness.  But she was in\nanother mood now, another atmosphere--the atmosphere she had breathed\nsince she was thirteen, except in the brief period when her infatuation\nfor Scarborough had swept her away from her world.\n\n\"No!\"  She shook her head with decision--and felt decided.  But to his\npractised ear there was in her voice a hint that she might hear him\nfurther on the subject.\n\nThey lay back in their chairs, he watching the ragged, dirty, scurrying\nclouds, she watching him.  After a while he said: \"Where are you going\nwhen we reach the other side?\"\n\n\"To join mother and auntie.\"\n\n\"And how long will you stay with them?\"\n\n\"Not more than a week, I should say,\" she answered with a grimace.\n\n\"And then--where?\"\n\nShe did not reply for some time.  Studying her face, he saw an\nexpression of lonesomeness gather and strengthen and deepen until she\nlooked so forlorn that he felt as if he must take her in his arms.\nWhen she spoke it was to say dubiously:  \"Back to New York--to keep\nhouse for my brother--perhaps.\"\n\n\"And when his wife frees herself and he marries again--where will you\ngo?\"\n\nGladys lifted a fold of her cape and drew it about her as if she were\ncold.  But he noted that it hid her face from him.\n\n\"You want--you need--a home?  So do I,\" he went on tranquilly. \"You are\ntired of wandering?  So am I.  You are bored with parade and\nparade--people?  So am I.  You wish freedom, not bondage, when you\nmarry?  I refuse to be bound, and I don't wish to bind any one.  We\nhave the same friends, the same tastes, have had pretty much the same\nexperiences.  You don't want to be married for your money.  I'm not\nlikely to be suspected of doing that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Some one has said that rich men marry more often for money than poor\nmen,\" interrupted Gladys.  And then she colored as she recalled who had\nsaid it.\n\nLangdon noted her color as he noted every point in any game he was\nplaying; he shrewdly guessed its origin.  \"When Scarborough told you\nthat,\" he replied calmly, \"he told you a great truth. But please\nremember, I merely said I shouldn't be SUSPECTED of marrying you for\nmoney.  I didn't say I wasn't guilty.\"\n\n\"Is your list of reasons complete?\"\n\n\"Two more the clinchers.  You are disappointed in love--so am I. You\nneed consolation--so do I.  When one can't have the best one takes the\nbest one can get, if one is sensible.  It has been known to turn out\nnot so badly.\"\n\nThey once more lay back watching the clouds.  An hour passed without\neither's speaking.  The deck-steward brought them tea and biscuits\nwhich he declined and she accepted.  She tried the big, hard, tasteless\ndisk between her strong white teeth, then said with a sly smile:  \"You\npried into my secret a few minutes ago. I'm going to pry into yours.\nWho was she?\"\n\n\"As the lady would have none of me, there's no harm in confessing,\"\nreplied Langdon, carelessly.  \"She was--and is--and--\" he looked at\nher--\"ever shall be, world without end--Gladys Dumont.\"\n\nGladys gasped and glanced at him with swift suspicion that he was\njesting.  He returned her glance in a calm, matter-of-fact way. She\nleaned back in her chair and they watched the slippery rail slide up\nand down against the background of chilly, rainy sea and sky.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" he asked after a long silence.\n\n\"No,\" she replied.  \"I was thinking.\"\n\n\"Of my--proposition?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it grow on you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe shifted himself to a sitting position with much deliberateness.  He\nput his hand in among her rugs and wraps until it touched hers.  \"It\nmay turn out better than you anticipate,\" he said, a little sentiment\nin his eyes and smile, a little raillery in his voice.\n\n\"I doubt if it will,\" she answered, without looking at him directly.\n\"For--I--anticipate a great deal.\"\n\n\n\nXXIV.\n\nDUMONT BETRAYS DUMONT.\n\nFanshaw versus Fanshaw was heard privately by a referee; and before\nMrs. Fanshaw's lawyers had a chance to ask that the referee's report be\nsealed from publicity, the judge of his own motion ordered it.  At the\npolitical club to which he belonged, he had received an intimation from\nthe local \"boss\" that if Dumont's name were anywhere printed in\nconnection with the case he would be held responsible.  Thus it came to\npass that on the morning of the filing of the decree the newspapers\nwere grumbling over their inability to give the eagerly-awaited details\nof the great scandal.  And Herron was Catonizing against \"judicial\ncorruption.\"\n\nBut Dumont was overswift in congratulating himself on his escape and in\npreening himself on his power.\n\nFor several days the popular newspapers were alone in denouncing the\njudge for favoritism and in pointing out that the judiciary were\n\"becoming subservient to the rich and the powerful in their\nrearrangements of their domestic relations--a long first step toward\ncomplete subservience.\"  Herron happened to have among his intimates\nthe editor of an eminently respectable newspaper that prides itself\nupon never publishing private scandals.  He impressed his friend with\nhis own strong views as to the gravity of this growing discrimination\nbetween masses and classes; and the organ of independent conservatism\nwas presently lifting up its solemn voice in a stentorian jeremiad.\n\nWithout this reinforcement the \"yellows\" might have shrieked in vain.\nIt was assumed that baffled sensationalism was by far a stronger motive\nwith them than justice, and the public was amused rather than aroused\nby their protests.  But now soberer dailies and weeklies took up the\ncase and the discussion spread to other cities, to the whole country.\nBy his audacity, by his arrogant frankness he had latterly treated\npublic opinion with scantiest courtesy--by his purchase of campaign\ncommittees, and legislatures, and courts, Dumont had made himself in\nthe public mind an embodiment of the \"mighty and menacing plutocracy\"\nof which the campaign orators talked so much.  And the various phases\nof the scandal gave the press a multitude of texts for satirical, or\npessimistic, or fiery discourses upon the public and private rottenness\nof \"plutocrats.\"\n\nBut Dumont's name was never directly mentioned.  Every one knew who was\nmeant; no newspaper dared to couple him in plain language with the\nscandal.  The nearest approach to it was where one New York newspaper\npublished, without comment, in the center of a long news article on the\ncase, two photographs of Dumont side by side--one taken when he first\ncame to New York, clear-cut, handsome, courageous, apparently a type of\nprogressive young manhood; the other, taken within the year, gross,\nlowering, tyrannical, obviously a type of indulged, self-indulgent\ndespot.\n\nHerron had forced Fanshaw to abandon the idea of suing Dumont for a\nmoney consolation.  He had been deeply impressed by his wife's warnings\nagainst Fanshaw--\"a lump of soot, and sure to smutch you if you go near\nhim.\"  He was reluctant to have Fanshaw give up the part of the plan\nwhich insured the public damnation of Dumont, but there was no other\nprudent course.  He assured himself that he knew Fanshaw to be an\nupright man; but he did not go to so perilous a length in\nself-deception as to fancy he could convince cynical and incredulous\nNew York.  It was too eager to find excuses for successful and admired\nmen like Dumont, too ready to laugh at and despise underdogs like\nFanshaw.  Herron never admitted it to himself, but in fact it was he\nwho put it into Fanshaw's resourceless mind to compass the revenge of\npublicity in another way.\n\nFanshaw was denouncing the judge for sealing the divorce testimony, and\nthe newspapers for being so timid about libel laws and contempt of\ncourt.\n\n\"If a newspaper should publish the testimony,\" said Herron, \"Judge\nGlassford would never dare bring the editor before him for contempt.\nHis record's too bad.  I happen to know he was in the News-Record\noffice no longer ago than last month, begging for the suppression of an\narticle that might have caused his impeachment, if published.  So\nthere's one paper that wouldn't be afraid of him.\"\n\n\"Then why does it shield the scoundrel?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Herron, his hand on the door of his office\nlaw-library, \"it hasn't been able to get hold of a copy of the\ntestimony.\"  And having thus dropped the seed on good soil, he left.\n\nFanshaw waited several weeks, waited until certain other plans of his\nand Herron's were perfected.  Then he suddenly deluged the sinking\nflames of the divorce discussion with a huge outpouring of oil.\nIndirectly and with great secrecy he sent a complete copy of the\ntestimony to the newspaper Herron had mentioned, the most sensational,\nand one of the most widely circulated in New York.\n\nThe next morning Dumont had to ring three times for his secretary.\nWhen Culver finally appeared he had in his trembling right hand a copy\nof the News-Record.  His face suggested that he was its owner,\npublisher and responsible editor, and that he expected then and there\nto be tortured to death for the two illustrated pages of the \"Great\nFanshaw-Dumont Divorce!  All the Testimony!  Shocking Revelations!\"\n\n\"I thought it necessary for you to know this without delay, sir,\" he\nsaid in a shaky voice, as he held out the newspaper to his master.\n\nDumont grew sickly yellow with the first glance at those head-lines.\nHe had long been used to seeing extensive and highly unflattering\naccounts of himself and his doings in print; but theretofore every open\nattack had been on some public matter where a newspaper \"pounding\"\nmight be attributed to politics or stock-jobbery.  Here--it was a\nverbatim official report, and of a private scandal, more dangerous to\nhis financial standing than the fiercest assault upon his honesty as a\nfinancier; for it tore away the foundation of reputation--private\ncharacter.  A faithful transcript throughout, it portrayed him as a bag\nof slimy gold and gilded slime.  He hated his own face staring out at\nhim from a three-column cut in the center of the first page--its heavy\njaw, its cynical mouth, its impudent eyes.  \"Do I look like THAT?\" he\nthought.  He was like one who, walking along the streets, catches sight\nof his own image in a show-window mirror and before he recognizes it,\nsees himself as others see him.  He flushed to his temples at the\ncontrast with the smaller cut beside it--the face of Pauline, high and\nfine icily beautiful as always in her New York days when her features\nwere in repose.\n\nCulver shifted from one weak leg to the other, and the movement\nreminded Dumont of his existence.  \"That's all.  Clear out!\" he\nexclaimed, and fell back into his big chair and closed his eyes. He\nthought he at last understood publicity.\n\nBut he was mistaken.\n\nHe finished dressing and choked down a little breakfast.  As he\nadvanced toward the front door the servant there coughed uneasily and\nsaid:  \"Beg pardon, sir, but I fear you won't be able to get out.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he demanded, his brows contracting and his lips\nbeginning to slide back in a snarl--it promised to be a sad morning for\nhuman curs of all kinds who did not scurry out of the lion's way.\n\n\"The crowd, sir,\" said the servant.  And he drew aside the curtain\nacross the glass in one of the inside pair of great double doors of the\npalace entrance.  \"It's quite safe to look, sir.  They can't see\nthrough the outside doors as far as this.\"\n\nDumont peered through the bronze fretwork.  A closely packed mass of\npeople was choking the sidewalk and street--his brougham was like an\nisland in a troubled lake.  He saw several policemen--they were trying\nto move the crowd on, but not trying sincerely.  He saw three huge\ncameras, their operators under the black cloths, their lenses pointed\nat the door--waiting for him to appear.  For the first time in his life\nhe completely lost his nerve.  Not only publicity, the paper--a\nlifeless sheet of print; but also publicity, the public--with living\neyes to peer and living voices to jeer.  He looked helplessly,\nappealingly at the \"cur\" he had itched to kick the moment before.\n\n\"What the devil shall I do?\" he asked in a voice without a trace of\ncourage.\n\n\"I don't know, sir,\" replied the servant.  \"The basement door wouldn't\nhelp very much, would it?\"\n\nThe basement door was in front also.  \"Idiot!  Is there no way out at\nthe rear?\" he asked.\n\n\"Only over the fences, sir,\" said the servant, perfectly\nmatter-of-fact.  Having no imagination, his mind made no picture of the\ngreat captain of industry scrambling over back fences like a stray cat\nflying from a brick.\n\nDumont turned back and into his first-floor sitting-room.  He unlocked\nhis stand of brandy bottles, poured out an enormous drink and gulped it\ndown.  His stomach reeled, then his head.  He went to the window and\nlooked out--there must have been five hundred people in the street, and\nvehicles were making their way slowly and with difficulty, drivers\ngaping at the house and joking with the crowd; newsboys, bent sidewise\nto balance their huge bundles of papers, were darting in and out, and\neven through the thick plate glass he could hear:  \"All about\nMillionaire Dumont's disgrace!\"\n\nHe went through to a rear window.  No, there was a continuous wall, a\nhigh brick wall.  A servant came and told him he was wanted at the\ntelephone.  It was Giddings, who said in a voice that was striving in\nvain to be calm against the pressure of some intense excitement:  \"You\nare coming down to-day, Mr. Dumont?\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Dumont, snapping the word out as short and savage as the\ncrack of a lash.\n\n\"There are disquieting rumors of a raid on us.\"\n\n\"Who's to do the raiding?\"\n\n\"They say it's Patterson and Fanning-Smith and Cassell and Herron.\nIt's a raid for control.\"\n\nDumont snorted scornfully.  \"Don't fret.  We're all right.  I'll be\ndown soon.\"  And he hung up the receiver, muttering:  \"The ass!  I must\nkick him out!  He's an old woman the instant I turn my back.\"\n\nHe had intended not to go down, but to shut himself in with the brandy\nbottle until nightfall.  This news made his presence in the Street\nimperative.  \"They couldn't have sprung at me at a worse time,\" he\nmuttered.  \"But I can take care of 'em!\"\n\nHe returned to the library, took another drink, larger than the first.\nHis blood began to pound through his veins and to rush along under the\nsurface of his skin like a sheet of fire.  Waves of fury surged into\nhis brain, making him dizzy, confusing his sight--he could scarcely\nrefrain from grinding his teeth.  He descended to the basement, his\nstep unsteady.\n\n\"A ladder,\" he ordered in a thick voice.\n\nHe led the way to the rear wall.  A dozen men-servants swarming about,\ntried to assist him.  He ordered them aside and began to climb.  As the\nupper part of his body rose above the wall-line he heard a triumphant\nshout, many voices crying:  \"There he is! There he is!\"\n\nThe lot round the corner from his place was not built upon; and there,\nin the side street, was a rapidly swelling crowd, the camera-bearers\nhastily putting their instruments in position, the black cloths\nfluttering like palls or pirate flags.  With a roaring howl he released\nhis hold upon the ladder and shook both fists, his swollen face blazing\nbetween them.  He tottered, fell backward, crashed upon the stone\nflooring of the area.  His head struck with a crack that made the\nwomen-servants scream.  The men lifted him and carried him into the\nhouse.  He was not stunned; he tried to stand.  But he staggered back\ninto the arms of his valet and his butler.\n\n\"Brandy!\" he gasped.\n\nHe took a third drink--and became unconscious.  When the doctor arrived\nhe was raving in a high fever.  For years he had drunk to excess--but\ntheretofore only when HE chose, never when his appetite chose, never\nwhen his affairs needed a clear brain.  Now appetite, long lying in\nwait for him, had found him helpless in the clutches of rage and fear,\nand had stolen away his mind.\n\nThe news was telephoned to the office at half-past eleven o'clock.  \"It\ndoesn't matter,\" said Giddings.  \"He'd only make things worse if he\nwere to come now.\"\n\nGiddings was apparently right.  From a tower of strength, supporting\nalone, yet with ease, National Woolens, and the vast structure based\nupon it, Dumont had crumbled into an obstruction and a weakness.  There\nis an abysmal difference between everybody knowing a thing privately\nand everybody knowing precisely the same thing publicly.  In that\nnewspaper exposure there was no fact of importance that was not known\nto the entire Street, to his chief supporters in his great syndicate of\nranches, railroads, factories, steamship lines and selling agencies.\nBut the tremendous blare of publicity acted like Joshua's horns at\nJericho.  The solid walls of his public reputation tottered, toppled,\nfell flat.\n\nThere had been a tight money-market for two weeks.  Though there had\nbeen uneasiness as to all the small and many of the large\n\"industrials,\" belief in National Woolens and in the stability of John\nDumont had remained strong.  But of all the cowards that stand sentinel\nfor capital, the most craven is Confidence.  At the deafening crash of\nthe fall of Dumont's private character, Confidence girded its loins and\ntightened its vocal cords to be in readiness for a shrieking flight.\n\nDumont ruled, through a parent and central corporation, the National\nWoolens Company, which held a majority of the stock in each of the\nseventeen corporations constituting the trust.  His control was in part\nthrough ownership of Woolens stock but chiefly through proxies sent him\nby thousands of small stock-holders because they had confidence in his\nabilities.  To wrest control from him it was necessary for the raiders\nboth to make him \"unload\" his own holdings of stock and to impair his\nreputation so that his supporters would desert him or stand aloof.\n\nOn the previous day National Woolens closed at eighty-two for the\npreferred and thirty-nine for the common.  In the first hour of the day\nof the raid Giddings and the other members of Dumont's supporting group\nof financiers were able to keep it fairly steady at about five points\nbelow the closing price of the previous day, by buying all that was\noffered--the early offerings were large, but not overwhelming.  The\nsupporters of other industrials saw that the assault on Woolens was a\nmenace to their stocks--if a strong industrial weakened, the weaker\nones would inevitably suffer disaster in the frightened market that\nwould surely result.  They showed a disposition to rally to the support\nof the Dumont stocks.\n\nAt eleven o'clock Giddings began to hope that the raid was a failure,\nif indeed it had been a real raid.  At eleven-twenty Herron played his\ntrump card.\n\nThe National Industrial Bank is the huge barometer to which both\nspeculative and investing Wall Street looks for guidance.  Whom that\nbank protects is as safe as was the medieval fugitive who laid hold of\nthe altar in the sanctuary; whom that bank frowns upon in the hour of\nstress is lost indeed if he have so much as a pin's-point area of heel\nthat is vulnerable.  Melville, president of the National Industrial,\nwas a fanatically religious man, with as keen a nose for heretics as\nfor rotten spots in collateral. He was peculiarly savage in his hatred\nof all matrimonial deviations.  He was a brother of Fanshaw's mother;\nand she and Herron had been working upon him.  But so long as Dumont's\nshare in the scandal was not publicly attributed he remained\nobdurate--he never permitted his up-town creed or code to interfere\nwith his down-town doings unless it became necessary--that is, unless\nit could be done without money loss. For up-town or down-town, to make\nmoney was always and in all circumstances the highest morality, to lose\nmoney the profoundest immorality.\n\nAt twenty minutes past eleven Melville and the president of the other\nbanks of his chain called loans to Dumont and the Dumont supporting\ngroup to the amount of three millions and a quarter. Ten minutes later\nother banks and trust companies whose loans to Dumont and his allies\neither were on call or contained provisions permitting a demand for\nincreased collateral, followed Melville's example and aimed and sped\ntheir knives for Dumont's vitals.\n\nGiddings found himself face to face with unexpected and peremptory\ndemands for eleven millions in cash and thirteen millions in additional\ncollateral securities.  If he did not meet these demands forthwith the\nbanks and trust companies, to protect themselves, would throw upon the\nmarket at whatever price they could get the thirty-odd millions of\nWoolens stocks which they held as collateral for the loans.\n\n\"What does this mean, Eaversole?\" he exclaimed, with white, wrinkled\nlips, heavy circles suddenly appearing under his eyes. \"Is Melville\ntrying to ruin everything?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Eaversole, third vice-president of the company. \"He's\nsupporting the market, all except us.  He says Dumont must be driven\nout of the Street.  He says his presence here is a pollution and a\nsource of constant danger.\"\n\nThe National Woolens supporting group was alone; it could get no help\nfrom any quarter, as every possible ally was frightened into his own\nbreastworks for the defense of his own interests. Dumont, the brain and\nthe will of the group, had made no false moves in business, had been\nbold only where his matchless judgment showed him a clear way; but he\nhad not foreseen the instantaneous annihilation of his chief asset--his\nreputation.\n\nGiddings sustained the unequal battle superbly.  He was cool, and\nwatchful, and effective.  It is doubtful if Dumont himself could have\ndone so well, handicapped as he would have been on that day by the\nFanshaw scandal.  Giddings cajoled and threatened, retreated slowly\nhere, advanced intrepidly there.  On the one side, he held back\nwavering banks and trust companies, persuading some that all was well,\nwarning others that if they pressed him they would lose all.  On the\nother side, he faced his powerful foes and made them quake as they saw\ntheir battalions of millions roll upon his unbroken line of battle only\nto break and disappear.  At noon National Woolens preferred was at\nfifty-eight, the common at twenty-nine.  Giddings was beginning to hope.\n\nAt three minutes past noon the tickers clicked out:  \"It is reported\nthat John Dumont is dying.\"\n\nAs that last word jerked letter by letter from under the printing wheel\nthe floor of the Stock Exchange became the rapids of a human Niagara.\nBy messenger, by telegraph, by telephone, holders of National Woolens\nand other industrials, in the financial district, in all parts of the\ncountry, across the sea, poured in their selling orders upon the\nfrenzied brokers.  And all these forces of hysteria and panic,\nprojected into that narrow, roofed-in space, made of it a chaos of\ncontending demons.  All stocks were caught in the upheaval; Melville's\nplans to limit the explosion were blown skyward, feeble as straws in a\ncyclone. Amid shrieks and howls and frantic tossings of arms and mad\nrushes and maniac contortions of faces, National Woolens and all the\nDumont stocks bent, broke, went smashing down, down, down, every one\nstruggling to unload.\n\nDumont's fortune was the stateliest of the many galleons that day\ndriven on the rocks and wrecked.  Dumont's crew was for the most part\nengulfed.  Giddings and a few selected friends reached the shore\nhalf-drowned and humbly applied at the wreckers' camp; they were\nhospitably received and were made as comfortable as their exhausted\ncondition permitted.\n\nJohn Dumont was at the mercy of Hubert Herron in his own company. If he\nlived he would be president only until the next annual meeting--less\nthan two months away; and the Herron crowd had won over enough of his\nboard of directors to make him meanwhile powerless where he had been\nautocrat.\n\n\n\nXXV.\n\nTHE FALLEN KING.\n\nToward noon the next day Dumont emerged from the stupor into which\nDoctor Sackett's opiate had plunged him.  At once his mind began to\ngrope about for the broken clues of his business.  His valet appeared.\n\n\"The morning papers,\" said Dumont.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the valet, and disappeared.\n\nAfter a few seconds Culver came and halted just within the doorway.\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but Doctor Sackett left strict orders that you were to\nbe quiet.  Your life depends on it.\"\n\nDumont scowled and his lower lip projected--the crowning touch in his\nmost imperious expression.  \"The papers, all of 'em,--quick!\" he\ncommanded.\n\nCulver took a last look at the blue-white face and bloodshot eyes to\ngive him courage to stand firm.  \"The doctor'll be here in a few\nminutes,\" he said, bowed and went out.\n\nChoking with impotent rage, Dumont rang for his valet and forced him to\nhelp him dress.  He was so weak when he finished that only his will\nkept him from fainting.  He took a stiff drink of the brandy--the odor\nwas sickening to him and he could hardly force it down.  But once down,\nit strengthened him.\n\n\"No, nothing to eat,\" he said thickly, and with slow but fairly steady\nstep left his room and descended to the library.  Culver was there--sat\nagape at sight of his master.  \"But you--you must not--\" he began.\n\nDumont gave him an ugly grin.  \"But I will!\" he said, and again drank\nbrandy.  He turned and went out and toward the front door, Culver\nfollowing with stammering protests which he heeded not at all.  On the\nsidewalk he hailed a passing hansom.  \"To the Edison Building,\" he said\nand drove off, Culver, bareheaded at the curb, looking dazedly after\nhim.  Before he reached Fifty-ninth Street he was half-sitting,\nhalf-reclining in the corner of the seat, his eyes closed and his\nsenses sinking into a stupor from the fumes of the powerful doses of\nbrandy.  As the hansom drove down the avenue many recognized him,\nwondered and pitied as they noted his color, his collapsed body, head\nfallen on one side, mouth open and lips greenish gray.  As the hansom\nslowly crossed the tracks at Twenty-third Street the heavy jolt roused\nhim.\n\n\"The newspapers,\" he muttered, and hurled up through the trap in the\nroof an order to the driver to stop.  He leaned over the doors and\nbought half a dozen newspapers of the woman at the Flat-iron stand.  As\nthe hansom moved on he glanced at the head-lines--they were big and\nstaring, but his blurred eyes could not read them.  He fell asleep\nagain, his hands clasped loosely about the huge proclamations of\nyesterday's battle and his rout.\n\nThe hansom was caught in a jam at Chambers Street.  The clamor of\nshouting, swearing drivers roused him.  The breeze from the open sea,\nblowing straight up Broadway into his face, braced him like the tonic\nthat it is.  He straightened himself, recovered his train of thought,\nstared at one of the newspapers and tried to grasp the meaning of its\nhead-lines.  But they made only a vague impression on him.\n\n\"It's all lies,\" he muttered.  \"Lies!  How could those fellows smash\nME!\"  And he flung the newspapers out of the hansom into the faces of\ntwo boys seated upon the tail of a truck.\n\n\"You're drunk early,\" yelled one of the boys.\n\n\"That's no one-day jag,\" shouted the other.  \"It's a hang-over.\"\n\nHe made a wild, threatening gesture and, as his hansom drove on,\nmuttered and mumbled to himself, vague profanity aimed at nothing and\nat everything.  At the Edison Building he got out.\n\n\"Wait!\" he said to the driver.  He did not see the impudent smirk on\nthe face of the elevator boy nor the hesitating, sheepish salutation of\nthe door-man, uncertain how to greet the fallen king.  He went straight\nto his office, unlocked his desk and, just in time to save himself from\nfainting, seized and half-emptied a flask of brandy he kept in a\ndrawer.  It had been there--but untouched ever since he came to New\nYork and took those offices; he never drank in business hours.\n\nHis head was aching horribly and at every throb of his pulse a pain\ntore through him.  He rang for his messenger.\n\n\"Tell Mr. Giddings I want to see him--you!\" he said, his teeth clenched\nand his eyes blazing--he looked insane.\n\nGiddings came.  His conscience was clear--he had never liked Dumont,\nowed him nothing, yet had stood by him until further fidelity would\nhave ruined himself, would not have saved Dumont, or prevented the\nHerron-Cassell raiders from getting control. Now that he could afford\nto look at his revenge-books he was deeply resenting the insults and\nindignities heaped upon him in the past five years.  But he was unable\nto gloat, was moved to pity, at sight of the physical and mental wreck\nin that chair which he had always seen occupied by the most robust of\ndespots.\n\n\"Well,\" said Dumont in a dull, far-away voice, without looking at him.\n\"What's happened?\"\n\nGiddings cast about for a smooth beginning but could find none. \"They\ndid us up--that's all,\" he said funereally.\n\nDumont lifted himself into a momentary semblance of his old look and\nmanner.  \"You lie, damn you!\" he shouted, his mouth raw and ragged as a\nhungry tiger's.\n\nGiddings began to cringe, remembered the changed conditions, bounded to\nhis feet.\n\n\"I'll tolerate such language from no man!\" he exclaimed.  \"I wish you\ngood morning, sir!\"  And he was on his way to the door.\n\n\"Come back!\" commanded Dumont.  And Giddings, the habit of implicit\nobedience to that voice still strong upon him, hesitated and half\nturned.\n\nDumont was more impressed with the truth of the cataclysm by Giddings'\nrevolt than by the newspaper head-lines or by Giddings' words.  And\nfrom somewhere in the depths of his reserve-self he summoned the last\nof his coolness and self-control.  \"Beg pardon, Giddings,\" said he.\n\"You see I'm not well.\"\n\nGiddings returned--he had taken orders all his life, he had submitted\nto this master slavishly; the concession of an apology mollified him\nand flattered him in spite of himself.\n\n\"Oh, don't mention it,\" he said, seating himself again.  \"As I was\nsaying, the raid was a success.  I did the best I could. Some called\nour loans and some demanded more collateral.  And while I was fighting\nfront and rear and both sides, bang came that lie about your condition.\nThe market broke.  All I could do was sell, sell, sell, to try to meet\nor protect our loans.\"\n\nGiddings heard a sound that made him glance at Dumont.  His head had\nfallen forward and he was snoring.  Giddings looked long and pityingly.\n\n\"A sure enough dead one,\" he muttered, unconsciously using the slang of\nthe Street which he habitually avoided.  And he went away, closing the\ndoor behind him.\n\nAfter half an hour Dumont roused himself--out of a stupor into a\nhalf-delirious dream.\n\n\"Must get cash,\" he mumbled, \"and look after the time loans.\" He lifted\nhis head and pushed back his hair from his hot forehead.  \"I'll stamp\non those curs yet!\"\n\nHe took another drink--his hands were so unsteady that he had to use\nboth of them in lifting it to his lips.  He put the flask in his pocket\ninstead of returning it to the drawer.  No one spoke to him, all\npretended not to see him as he passed through the offices on his way to\nthe elevator.  With glassy unseeing eyes he fumbled at the dash-board\nand side of the hansom; with a groan like a rheumatic old man's he\nlifted his heavy body up into the seat, dropped back and fell asleep.\nA crowd of clerks and messengers, newsboys and peddlers gathered and\ngaped, awed as they looked at the man who had been for five years one\nof the heroes of the Street, and thought of his dazzling catastrophe.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired a new-comer, apparently a tourist, edging\nhis way into the outskirts of the crowd.\n\n\"That's Dumont, the head of the Woolens Trust,\" the curb-broker he\naddressed replied in a low tone.  \"He was raided yesterday--woke up in\nthe morning worth a hundred millions, went to bed worth--perhaps five,\nmaybe nothing at all.\"\n\nAt this exaggeration of the height and depth of the disaster, awe and\nsympathy became intense in that cluster of faces.  A hundred millions\nto nothing at all, or at most a beggarly five millions--what a dizzy\nprecipice!  Great indeed must be he who could fall so far.  The driver\npeered through the trap, wondering why his distinguished fare endured\nthis vulgar scrutiny.  He saw that Dumont was asleep, thrust down a\nhand and shook him. \"Where to, sir?\" he asked, as Dumont straightened\nhimself.\n\n\"To the National Industrial Bank, you fool,\" snapped Dumont. \"How many\ntimes must I tell you?\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said the driver--without sarcasm, thinking\nsteadfastly of his pay--and drove swiftly away.\n\nTheretofore, whenever he had gone to the National Industrial Bank he\nhad been received as one king is received by another.  Either eager and\nobsequious high officers of King Melville had escorted him directly to\nthe presence, or King Melville, because he had a caller who could not\nbe summarily dismissed, had come out apologetically to conduct King\nDumont to another audience chamber.  That day the third assistant\ncashier greeted him with politeness carefully graded to the due of a\nman merely moderately rich and not a factor in the game of high finance.\n\n\"Be seated, Mr. Dumont,\" he said, pointing to a chair just inside the\nrailing--a seat not unworthy of a man of rank in the plutocratic\nhierarchy, but a man of far from high rank.  \"I'll see whether Mr.\nMelville's disengaged.\"\n\nDumont dropped into the chair and his heavy head was almost immediately\nresting upon his shirt-bosom.  The third assistant cashier returned,\nroused him somewhat impatiently.  \"Mr. Melville's engaged,\" said he.\n\"But Mr. Cowles will see you.\" Mr. Cowles was the third vice-president.\n\nDumont rose.  The blood flushed into his face and his body shook from\nhead to foot.  \"Tell Melville to go to hell,\" he jerked out, the haze\nclearing for a moment from his piercing, wicked eyes.  And he stalked\nthrough the gateway in the railing.  He turned.  \"Tell him I'll tear\nhim down and grind him into the gutter within six months.\"\n\nIn the hansom again, he reflected or tried to reflect.  But the lofty\nbuildings seemed to cast a black shadow on his mind, and the roar and\nrush of the tremendous tide of traffic through that deep canon set his\nthoughts to whirling like drink-maddened bacchanals dancing round a\npunch-bowl.  \"That woman!\" he exclaimed suddenly.  \"What asses they\nmake of us men!  And all these vultures--I'm not carrion yet.  But THEY\nsoon will be!\" And he laughed and his thoughts began their crazy spin\nagain.\n\nA newsboy came, waving an extra in at the open doors of the hansom.\n\"Dumont's downfall!\" he yelled in his shrill, childish voice.  \"All\nabout the big smash!\"\n\nDumont snatched a paper and flung a copper at the boy.\n\n\"Gimme a tip on Woolens, Mr. Dumont,\" said the boy, with an impudent\ngrin, balancing himself for flight.  \"How's Mrs. Fanshaw?\"\n\nThe newspapers had made his face as familiar as the details of his\nprivate life.  He shrank and quivered.  He pushed up the trap.  \"Home!\"\nhe said, forgetting that the hansom and driver were not his own.\n\n\"All right, Mr. Dumont!\" replied the driver.  Dumont shrank again and\nsat cowering in the corner--the very calling him by his name, now a\nsynonym for failure, disgrace, ridicule and contempt, seemed a subtile\ninsult.\n\nWith roaring brain and twitching, dizzy eyes he read at the newspaper's\naccount of his overthrow.  And gradually there formed in his mind a\ncoherent notion of how it had come to pass, of its extent; of why he\nfound himself lying in the depths, the victim of humiliations so\nfrightful that they penetrated even to him, stupefied and crazed with\ndrink and fever though he was.  His courage, his self-command were\nburnt up by the brandy.  His body had at last revolted, was having its\nterrible revenge upon the mind that had so long misused it in every\nkind of indulgence.\n\n\"I'm done for--done for,\" he repeated audibly again and again, at each\nrepetition looking round mentally for a fact or a hope that would deny\nthis assertion--but he cast about in vain. \"Yes, I'm done for.\"  And\nflinging away the newspaper he settled back and ceased to try to think\nof his affairs.  After a while tears rolled from under his blue\neyelids, dropped haltingly down his cheeks, spread out upon his lips,\ntasted salt in his half-open mouth.\n\nThe hansom stopped before his brick and marble palace.  The butler\nhurried out and helped him alight--not yet thirty-seven, he felt as if\nhe were a dying old man.  \"Pay the cabby,\" he said and groped his way\ninto the house and to the elevator and mechanically ran himself up to\nhis floor.  His valet was in his dressing-room.  He waved him away.\n\"Get out!  And don't disturb me till I ring.\"\n\n\"The doctor--\" began Mallow.\n\n\"Do as I tell you!\"\n\nWhen he was alone he poured out brandy and gulped it down a drink that\nmight have eaten the lining straight out of a stomach less powerful\nthan his.  He went from door to door, locking them all. Then he seated\nhimself in a lounging-chair before the long mirror.  He stared toward\nthe image of himself but was so dim-eyed that he could see nothing but\nspinning black disks. \"Life's not such a good game even when a man's\nwinning,\" he said aloud.  \"A rotten bad game when he's losing.\"\n\nHis head wabbled to fall forward but he roused himself.  \"Wife gone--\"\nThe tears flooded his eyes--tears of pity for himself, an injured and\nabandoned husband.  \"Wife gone,\" he repeated. \"Friends gone--\"  He\nlaughed sardonically.  \"No, never had friends, thank God, or I\nshouldn't have lasted this long.  No such thing as friends--a man gets\nwhat he can pay for.  Grip gone--luck gone!  What's the use?\"\n\nHe dozed off, presently to start into acute, shuddering consciousness.\nAt the far end of the room, stirring, slowly oozing from under the\ndivan was a--a Thing!  He could not define its shape, but he knew that\nit was vast, that it was scaly, with many short fat legs tipped with\nclaws; that its color was green, that its purpose was hideous, gleaming\nin craft from large, square, green-yellow eyes.  He wiped the sticky\nsweat from his brow.  \"It's only the brandy,\" he said loudly, and the\nThing faded, vanished.  He drew a deep breath of relief.\n\nHe went to a case of drawers and stood before it, supporting himself by\nthe handles of the second drawer.  \"Yes,\" he reflected, \"the revolver's\nin that drawer.\"  He released the handles and staggered back to his\nchair.  \"I'm crazy,\" he muttered, \"crazy as a loon.  I ought to ring\nfor the doctor.\"\n\nIn a moment he was up again, but instead of going toward the bell he\nwent to the drawers and opened the second one.  In a compartment lay a\npearl-handled, self-cocking revolver.  He put his hand on it, shivered,\ndrew his hand away--the steel and the pearl were cold.  He closed the\ndrawer with a quick push, opened it again slowly, took up the revolver,\nstaggered over to his desk and laid it there.  His face was chalk-white\nin spots and his eyes were stiff in their sockets.  He rested his\naching, burning, reeling head on his hands and stared at the revolver.\n\n\"But,\" he said aloud, as if contemptuously dismissing a suggestion,\n\"why should I shoot myself?  I can smash 'em all--to powder--grind 'em\ninto the dirt.\"\n\nHe took up the revolver.  \"What'd be the use of smashing 'em?\" he said\nwearily.  He felt tired and sick, horribly sick.\n\nHe laid it down.  \"I'd better be careful,\" he thought.  \"I'm not in my\nright mind.  I might--\"\n\nHe took it in his hand and went to the mirror and put the muzzle\nagainst his temple.  He laughed crazily.  \"A little pressure on that\ntrigger and--bang!  I'd be in kingdom come and shouldn't give a damn\nfor anybody.\"  He caught sight of his eyes in the mirror and hastily\ndropped his arm to his side.  \"No, I'd never shoot myself in the\ntemple.  The heart'd be better.  Just here\"--and he pressed the muzzle\ninto the soft material of his coat--\"if I touched the trigger--\"\n\nAnd his finger did touch the trigger.  Pains shot through his chest\nlike cracks radiating in glass when a stone strikes it.  He looked at\nhis face--white, with wild eyes, with lips blue and ajar, the sweat\nstreaming from his forehead.\n\n\"What have I done?\" he shrieked, mad with the dread of death. \"I must\ncall for help.\"  He turned toward the door, plunged forward, fell\nunconscious, the revolver flung half-way across the room.\n\n\nWhen he came to his senses he was in his bed--comfortable, weak, lazy.\nWith a slight effort he caught the thread of events.  He turned his\neyes and saw a nurse, seated at the head of his bed, reading.  \"Am I\ngoing to die?\" he asked--his voice was thin and came in faint gusts.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" replied the nurse, putting down her book and standing\nover him, her face showing genuine reassurance and cheerfulness.\n\n\"You'll be well very soon.  But you must lie quiet and not talk.\"\n\n\"Was it a bad wound?\"\n\n\"The fever was the worst.  The bullet glanced round just under the\nsurface.\"\n\n\"It was an accident,\" he said, after a moment's thought.  \"I suppose\neverybody is saying I tried to kill myself.\"\n\n\"'Everybody' doesn't know anything about it.  Almost nobody knows.\nEven the servants don't know.  Your secretary sent them away, broke in\nand found you.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes and slept.\n\nWhen he awoke again he felt that a long time had passed, that he was\nmuch better, that he was hungry.  \"Nurse!\" he called.\n\nThe woman at the head of the bed rose and laid a cool hand upon his\nforehead.  \"How good that feels,\" he mumbled gratefully. \"What nice\nhands you have, nurse,\" and he lifted his glance to her face.  He\nstared wonderingly, confusedly.  \"I thought I was awake and almost\nwell,\" he murmured.  \"And instead, I'm out of my head.\"\n\n\"Can I do anything for you?\" It certainly was HER voice.\n\n\"Is it you, Pauline?\" he asked, as if he feared a negative answer.\n\n\"Yes--John.\"\n\nA long silence, then he said:  \"Why did you come?\"\n\n\"The doctor wrote me that--wrote me the truth.\"\n\n\"But haven't you heard?  Haven't you seen the papers?  Don't they say\nI'm ruined?\"\n\n\"Yes, John.\"\n\nHe lay silent for several minutes.  Then he asked hesitatingly:\n\"And--when--do you--go back--West?\"\n\n\"I have come to stay,\" she replied.  Neither in her voice nor in her\nface was there a hint of what those five words meant to her.\n\nHe closed his eyes again.  Presently a tear slid from under each lid\nand stood in the deep, wasted hollows of his eye-sockets.\n\n\n\nXXVI.\n\nA DESPERATE RALLY.\n\nWhen he awoke again he felt that he should get well rapidly.  He was\nweak, but it seemed the weakness of hunger rather than of illness.  His\nhead was clear, his nerves tranquil; his mind was as hungry for action\nas his body was for food.\n\n\"As soon as I've had something to eat,\" he said to himself, \"I'll be\nbetter than for years.  I needed this.\"  And straightway he began to\ntake hold of the outside world.\n\n\"Are you there, Pauline?\" he asked, after perhaps half an hour during\nwhich his mind had swiftly swept the whole surface of his affairs.\n\nThe nurse rose from the lounge across the foot of the bed. \"Your wife\nwas worn out, Mr. Dumont,\" she began.  \"She has--\"\n\n\"What day is it?\" he interrupted.\n\n\"Thursday.\"\n\n\"Of the month, I mean.\"\n\n\"The seventeenth,\" she answered, smiling in anticipation of his\nastonishment.\n\nBut he said without change of expression,\n\n\"Then I've been ill three weeks and three days.  Tell Mr. Culver I wish\nto see him at once.\"\n\n\"But the doctor--\"\n\n\"Damn the doctor,\" replied Dumont, good-naturedly.  \"Don't irritate me\nby opposing.  I shan't talk with Culver a minute by the clock.  What I\nsay will put my mind at rest.  Then I'll eat something and sleep for a\nday at least.\"\n\nThe nurse hesitated, but his eyes fairly forced her out of the room to\nfetch Culver.  \"Now remember, Mr. Dumont--less than a minute,\" she\nsaid.  \"I'll come back in just sixty seconds.\"\n\n\"Come in forty,\" he replied.  When she had closed the door he said to\nCulver:  \"What are the quotations on Woolens?\"\n\n\"Preferred twenty-eight; Common seven,\" answered Culver. \"They've been\nabout steady for two weeks.\"\n\n\"Good.  And what's Great Lakes and Gulf?\"\n\nCulver showed his surprise.  \"I'll have to consult the paper,\" he said.\n\"You never asked me for that quotation before.  I'd no idea you'd want\nit.\"  He went to the next room and immediately returned.  \"G. L. and G.\none hundred and two.\"\n\nDumont smiled with a satisfied expression.\n\n\"Now--go down-town--what time is it?\"\n\n\"Eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"Morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, morning.\"\n\n\"Go down-town at once and set expert accountants--get Evarts and\nSchuman--set them at work on my personal accounts with the Woolens\nCompany.  Tell everybody I'm expected to die, and know it, and am\ngetting facts for making my will.  And stay down-town yourself all\nday--find out everything you can about National Woolens and that\nraiding crowd and about Great Lakes and Gulf. The better you succeed in\nthis mission the better it'll be for you.  Thank you, by the way, for\nkeeping my accident quiet.  Find out how the Fanning-Smiths are\ncarrying National Woolens.  Find out--\"\n\nThe door opened and the plain, clean figure of the nurse appeared.\n\"The minute's up,\" she said.\n\n\"One second more, please.  Close the door.\"  When she had obeyed he\nwent on:  \"See Tavistock--you know you must be careful not to let any\none at his office know that you're connected with me.  See him--ask\nhim--no, telephone Tavistock to come at once--and you find out all you\ncan independently--especially about the Fanning-Smiths and Great Lakes\nand Gulf.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Culver.\n\n\"A great deal depends on your success,\" continued Dumont--\"a great deal\nfor me, a great deal--a VERY great deal for you.\"\n\nHis look met Culver's and each seemed satisfied with what he saw. Then\nCulver went, saying to himself:  \"What makes him think the\nFanning-Smiths were mixed up in the raid?  And what on earth has G. L.\nand G.  got to do with it?  Gad, he's a WONDER!\"  The longer Culver\nlived in intimacy with Dumont the greater became to him the mystery of\nhis combination of bigness and littleness, audacity and caution, devil\nand man.  \"It gets me,\" he often reflected, \"how a man can plot to rob\nmillions of people in one hour and in the next plan endowments for\nhospitals and colleges; despise public opinion one minute and the next\nbe courting it like an actor.  But that's the way with all these big\nfellows. And I'll know how to do it when I get to be one of 'em.\"\n\nAs the nurse reentered Dumont's bedroom he called out, lively as a boy:\n\"SOMETHING to eat!  ANYthing to eat!  EVERYthing to eat!\"\n\n\nThe nurse at first flatly refused to admit Tavistock.  But at half-past\nnine he entered, tall, lean, lithe, sharp of face, shrewd of eye,\nrakish of mustache; by Dumont's direction he closed and locked the\ndoor.  \"Why!\" he exclaimed, \"you don't look much of a sick man.  You're\nthin, but your color's not bad and your eyes are clear.  And down-town\nthey have you dying.\"\n\nDumont laughed.  Tavistock instantly recognized in laugh and look\nDumont's battle expression.  \"Dying--yes.  Dying to get at 'em.\nTavistock, we'll kick those fellows out of Wall Street before the\nmiddle of next week.  How much Great Lakes is there floating on the\nmarket?\"\n\nTavistock looked puzzled.  He had expected to talk National Woolens,\nand this man did not even speak of it, seemed absorbed in a stock in\nwhich Tavistock did not know he had any interest whatever.  \"G. L. and\nG.?\" he said.  \"Not much--perhaps thirty thousand shares.  It's been\nquiet for a long time.  It's an investment stock, you know.\"\n\nDumont smiled peculiarly.  \"I want a list of the stock-holders--not\nall, only those holding more than a thousand shares.\"\n\n\"There aren't many big holders.  Most of the stock's in small lots in\nthe middle West.\"\n\n\"So much the better.\"\n\n\"I'm pretty sure I can get you a fairly accurate list.\"\n\nTavistock, Dumont's very private and personal broker, had many curious\nways of reaching into the carefully guarded books and other business\nsecrets of brokers and of the enterprises listed on the New York Stock\nExchange.  He and Dumont had long worked together in the speculative\nparts of Dumont's schemes.  Dumont was the chief source of his rapidly\ngrowing fortune, though no one except Culver, not even Mrs. Tavistock,\nknew that they had business relations.  Dumont moved through Tavistock\nsecretly, and Tavistock in turn moved through other agents secretly.\nBut for such precautions as these the great men of Wall Street would be\nplaying with all the cards exposed for the very lambs to cock their\nears at.\n\n\"I want it immediately,\" said Dumont.  \"Only the larger holders, you\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Haste always costs.  I'll have to get hold of a man who can get hold\nof some one high up in the Great Lakes dividend department.\"\n\n\"Pay what you must--ten--twenty thousand--more if necessary. But get it\nto-night!\"\n\n\"I'll try.\"\n\n\"Then you'll get it.\"\n\nHe slept, with a break of fifteen minutes, until ten the next morning.\nThen Tavistock appeared with the list.  \"It was nearly midnight before\nmy man could strike a bargain, so I didn't telephone you.  The dividend\nclerk made a memory list.  I had him verify it this morning as early as\nhe could get at the books.  He says at least a third of the road is\nheld in small lots abroad. He's been in charge of the books for twenty\nyears, and he says there have been more changes in the last two months\nthan in all that time.  He thinks somebody has sold a big block of the\nstock on the quiet.\"\n\nDumont smiled significantly.  \"I think I understand that,\" he said.  He\nglanced at the list.  \"It's even shorter than I thought.\"\n\n\"You notice, one-third of the stock's tied up in the Wentworth estate,\"\nsaid Tavistock.\n\n\"Yes.  And here's the name of Bowen's dividend clerk.  Bowen is\ntraveling in the far East.  Probably he's left no orders about his\nGreat Lakes--why should he when it's supposed to be as sound and steady\nas Government bonds?  That means another fifty thousand shares out of\nthe way for our purposes.  Which of these names stand for the\nFanning-Smiths?\"\n\n\"I only recognize Scannell--James Fanning-Smith's private secretary.\nBut there must be others, as he's down for only twenty-one thousand\nshares.\"\n\n\"Then he's the only one,\" said Dumont, \"for the Fanning-Smiths have\nonly twenty-one thousand shares at the present time.  I know that\npositively.\"\n\n\"What!\" Tavistock showed that he was astounded.  \"I knew James\nFanning-Smith was an ass, but I never suspected him of such folly as\nthat.  So they are the ones that have been selling?\"\n\n\"Yes--not only selling what they owned but also--  However, no matter.\nIt's safe to say there are less than a hundred and fifty thousand\nshares for us to take care of.  I want you to get me--right\naway--options for fifteen days on as many of these remaining big lots\nas possible.  Make the best terms you can--anything up to one hundred\nand twenty-five--and offer five or even ten dollars a share forfeit for\nthe option.  Make bigger offers--fifteen--where it's necessary.  Set\nyour people to work at once.  They've got the rest of to-day, all day\nto-morrow, all day Sunday.  But I'd rather the whole thing were closed\nup by Saturday night.  I'll be satisfied when you've got me control of\na hundred thousand shares--that'll be the outside of safety.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're reasonably sure to win, if you can carry that and look\nafter offerings of fifty thousand in the market.  The options on the\nhundred thousand shares oughtn't to cost you much more than a million.\nThe fifty thousand you'll have to buy in the market may cost you six or\nseven millions.\"  Tavistock recited these figures carelessly.  In\nreality he was watching Dumont shrewdly, for he had believed that the\nNational Woolens raid had ruined him, had certainly put him out of the\nlarge Wall Street moves.\n\n\"In that small drawer, to the left, in the desk there,\" said Dumont,\npointing.  \"Bring me the Inter-State National check-book, and pen and\nink.\"\n\nWhen he had the book he wrote eight checks, the first for fifty\nthousand, the next five for one hundred thousand each, the last two for\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand each.  \"The first check,\" he said, \"you\nmay use whenever you like.  The others, except the last two, will be\ngood after two o'clock to-day.  The last two can be used any time after\neleven to-morrow.  And--don't forget!  I'm supposed to be hopelessly\nill--but then, no one must know you've seen me or know anything about\nme.  Spread it as a rumor.\"\n\nTavistock went away convinced, enthusiastic.  There was that in Dumont\nwhich inspired men to their strongest, most intelligent efforts.  He\nwas harsh, he was tyrannical, treacherous even--in a large way, often\ncynically ungrateful.  But he knew how to lead, knew how to make men\nforget all but the passion for victory, and follow him loyally.\nTavistock had seen his financial brain solve too many \"unsolvable\"\nproblems not to have confidence in it.\n\n\"I might have known!\" he reflected.  \"Why, those fellows apparently\nonly scotched him.  They got the Woolens Company away from him.  He\nlets it go without a murmur when he sees he's beaten, and he turns his\nmind to grabbing a big railway as if Woolens had never existed.\"\n\nJust after his elevated train passed Chatham Square on the way\ndown-town Tavistock suddenly slapped his leg with noisy energy and\nexclaimed half-aloud, \"By Jove, of course!\" to the amusement of those\nnear him in the car.  He went on to himself: \"Why didn't I see it\nbefore?  Because it's so beautifully simple, like all the things the\nbig 'uns do.  He's a wonder.  So THAT'S what he's up to?  Gad, what a\nbreeze there'll be next week!\"\n\nAt eleven o'clock Doctor Sackett came into Dumont's bedroom, in arms\nagainst his patient.\n\n\"You're acting like a lunatic.  No business, I say--not for a week.\nAbsolute quiet, Mr. Dumont, or I'll not answer for the consequences.\"\n\n\"I see you want to drive me back into the fever,\" replied Dumont.  \"But\nI'm bent on getting well.  I need the medicine I've had this morning,\nand Culver's bringing me another dose.  If I'm not better when he\nleaves, I agree to try your prescription of fret and fume.\"\n\n\"You are risking your life.\"\n\nDumont smiled.  \"Possibly.  But I'm risking it for what's more than\nlife to me, my dear Sackett.\"\n\n\"You'll excite yourself.  You'll----\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I shall calm myself.  I'm never so calm and cheerful\nas when I'm fighting, unless it's when I'm getting ready to fight.\nThere's something inside me--I don't know what--but it won't let me\nrest till it has pushed me into action.  That's my nature.  If any one\nasks how I am, say you've no hope of my recovery.\"\n\n\"I shall tell only the truth in that case,\" said Sackett, but with\nresignation--he was beginning to believe that for his extraordinary\npatient extraordinary remedies might be best.\n\nDumont listened to Culver's report without interrupting him once.\nCulver's position had theretofore been most disadvantageous to himself.\nHe had been too near to Dumont, had been merged in Dumont's big\npersonality.  Whatever he did well seemed to Dumont merely the direct\nreflection of his own abilities; whatever he did ill seemed far more\nstupid than a similar blunder made by a less intimate subordinate--what\nexcuse for Culver's going wrong with the guiding hand of the Great Man\nalways upon him?\n\nIn this, his first important independent assignment, he had at last an\nopportunity to show his master what he could do, to show that he had\nnot learned the Dumont methods parrot-fashion, but intelligently, that\nhe was no mere reflecting asteroid to the Dumont sun, but a\nself-luminous, if lesser and dependent, star.\n\nDumont was in a peculiarly appreciative mood.\n\n\"Why, the fellow's got brains--GOOD brains,\" was his inward comment\nagain and again as Culver unfolded the information he had\ncollected--clear, accurate, non-essentials discarded, essentials given\nin detail, hidden points brought to the surface.\n\nIt was proof positive of Dumont's profound indifference to money that\nhe listened without any emotion either of anger or of regret to the\nfirst part of Culver's tale, the survey of the wreck--what had been\nforty millions now reduced to a dubious six.  Dumont had neither time\nnor strength for emotion; he was using all his mentality in gaging what\nhe had for the work in hand--just how long and how efficient was the\nbroken sword with which he must face his enemies in a struggle that\nmeant utter ruin to him if he failed.  For he felt that if he should\nfail he would never again be able to gather himself together to renew\nthe combat; either he would die outright or he would abandon himself to\nthe appetite which had just shown itself dangerously near to being the\nstrongest of the several passions ruling him.\n\nWhen Culver passed to the Herron coterie and the Fanning-Smiths and\nGreat Lakes and Gulf, Dumont was still motionless--he was now\nestimating the strength and the weaknesses of the enemy, and\nmiscalculation would be fatal.  At the end of three-quarters of an hour\nCulver stopped the steady, swift flow of his report--\"That's all the\nimportant facts.  There's a lot more but it would be largely\nrepetition.\"\n\nDumont looked at him with an expression that made him proud. \"Thanks,\nCulver.  At the next annual meeting we'll elect you to Giddings' place.\nPlease go back down-town and--\"  He rapidly indicated half a dozen\npoints which Culver had failed to see and investigate--the best\nsubordinate has not the master's eye; if he had, he would not be a\nsubordinate.\n\nDumont waved his hand in dismissal and settled himself to sleep. When\nCulver began to stammer thanks for the promised promotion, he frowned.\n\n\"Don't bother me with that sort of stuff.  The job's yours because\nyou've earned it.  It'll be yours as long as you can hold it down--or\nuntil you earn a better one.  And you'll be loyal as Giddings was--just\nas long as it's to your interest and not a second longer.  Otherwise\nyou'd be a fool, and I'd not have you about me.  Be off!\"\n\nHe slept an hour and a half, then Pauline brought him a cup of beef\nextract--\"A very small cup,\" he grumbled good-humoredly. \"And a very\nweak, watery mess in it.\"\n\nAs he lay propped in his bed drinking it--slowly to make it last the\nlonger--Pauline sat looking at him.  His hands had been fat and puffy;\nshe was filled with pity as she watched the almost scrawny hand holding\nthe cup to his lips; there were hollows between the tendons, and the\nwrist was gaunt.  Her gaze wandered to his face and rested there, in\nsympathy and tenderness.  The ravages of the fever had been\nfrightful--hollows where the swollen, sensual cheeks had been; the neck\ncaved in behind and under the jaw-bones; loose skin hanging in wattles,\ndeeply-set eyes, a pinched look about the nostrils and the corners of\nthe mouth.  He was homely, ugly even; except the noble curve of head\nand profile, not a trace of his former good looks--but at least that\nswinish, fleshy, fleshly expression was gone.\n\nA physical wreck, battered, torn, dismantled by the storm and fire of\ndisease!  It was hard for her to keep back her tears.\n\nTheir eyes met and his instantly shifted.  The rest of the world saw\nthe man of force bent upon the possessions which mean fame and honor\nregardless of how they are got.  He knew that he could deceive the\nworld, that so long as he was rich and powerful it would refuse to let\nhim undeceive it, though he might strive to show it what he was.  But\nhe knew that SHE saw him as he really was--knew him as only a husband\nand a wife can know each the other.  And he respected her for the\nqualities which gave her a right to despise him, and which had forced\nher to exercise that right.  He felt himself the superior of the rest\nof his fellow-beings, but her inferior; did she not successfully defy\nhim; could she not, without a word, by simply resting her calm gaze\nupon him, make him shift and slink?\n\nHe felt that he must change the subject--not of their conversation, for\nthey were not talking, but of their--her--thoughts.  He did not know\nprecisely what she was thinking of him, but he was certain that it was\nnot anything favorable how could it be?  In fact, fight though she did\nagainst the thought, into her mind as she looked, pitying yet\nshrinking, came his likeness to a wolf--starved and sick and gaunt, by\nweakness tamed into surface restraint, but in vicious teeth, in savage\nlips, in jaw made to crush for love of crushing, a wicked wolf,\nimpatient to resume the life of the beast of prey.\n\nBy a mischance unavoidable in a mind filled as was his he began to tell\nof his revenge--of the exhibition of power he purposed to give, sudden\nand terrible.  He talked of his enemies as a cat might of a mouse it\nwas teasing in the impassable circle of its paws.  She felt that they\ndeserved the thunderbolt he said he was about to hurl into them, but\nshe could not help feeling pity for them.  If what he said of his\nresources and power were true, how feeble, how helpless they\nwere--pygmies fatuously disporting themselves in the palm of a giant's\nhand, unconscious of where they were, of the cruel eyes laughing at\nthem, of the iron muscles that would presently contract that hand\nand--she shuddered; his voice came to her in a confused murmur.\n\n\"If he does not stop I shall loathe him AGAIN!\" she said to herself.\nThen to him:  \"Perhaps you'd like to see Langdon--he's in the\ndrawing-room with Gladys.\"\n\n\"I sent for him two hours ago.  Yes, tell him to come up at once.\"\n\nAs she took the cup he detained her hand.  She beat down the impulse to\nsnatch it away, let it lie passive.  He pressed his lips upon it.\n\n\"I haven't thanked you for coming back,\" he said in a low voice,\nholding to her hand nervously.\n\n\"But you know it wasn't because I'm not grateful, don't you?  I can\nhardly believe yet that it isn't a dream.  I'd have said there wasn't a\nhuman being on earth who'd have done it--except your mother.  No, not\neven you, only your mother.\"\n\nAt this tribute to her mother, unexpected, sincere, tears dimmed\nPauline's eyes and a sob choked up into her throat.\n\n\"It was your mother in you that made you come,\" he went on. \"But you\ncame--and I'll not forget it.  You said you had come to stay--is that\nso, Pauline?\"\n\nShe bent her head in assent.\n\n\"When I'm well and on top again--but there's nothing in words. All I'll\nsay is, you're giving me a chance, and I'll make the best of it.  I've\nlearned my lesson.\"\n\nHe slowly released her hand.  She stood there a moment, without\nspeaking, without any definite thought.  Then she left to send Langdon.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dumont reflected, \"it was her duty.  It's a woman's duty to be\nforgiving and gentle and loving and pure--they're made differently from\nmen.  It was unnatural, her ever going away at all.  But she's a good\nwoman, and she shall get what she deserves hereafter.  When I settle\nthis bill for my foolishness I'll not start another.\"\n\nDuty--that word summed up his whole conception of the right attitude of\na good woman toward a man.  A woman who acted from love might change\nher mind; but duty was safe, was always there when a man came back from\nwanderings which were mere amiable, natural weaknesses in the male.\nLove might adorn a honeymoon or an escapade; duty was the proper\nadornment of a home.\n\n\"I've just been viewing the wreck with Culver,\" he said, as Langdon\nentered, dressed in the extreme of the latest London fashion.\n\n\"Much damage?\"\n\n\"What didn't go in the storm was carried off by Giddings when he\nabandoned the ship.  But the hull's there and--oh, I'll get her off and\nfix her up all right.\"\n\n\"Always knew Giddings was a rascal.  He oozes piety and respectability.\nThat's the worst kind you have down-town.  When a man carries so much\ncharacter in his face--it's like a woman who carries so much color in\nher cheeks that you know it couldn't have come from the inside.\"\n\n\"You're wrong about Giddings.  He's honest enough.  Any other man would\nhave done the same in his place.  He stayed until there was no hope of\nsaving the ship.\"\n\n\"All lost but his honor--Wall Street honor, eh?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\nAfter a pause Langdon said:  \"I'd no idea you held much of your own\nstock.  I thought you controlled through other people's proxies and\nmade your profits by forcing the stock up or down and getting on the\nother side of the market.\"\n\n\"But, you see, I believe in Woolens,\" replied Dumont.  \"And I believe\nin it still, Langdon!\"  His eyes had in them the look of the fanatic.\n\n\"That concern is breath and blood and life to me, and wife and children\nand parents and brothers and sisters.  I've put my whole self into it.\nI conceived it.  I brought it into the world.  I nursed it and brought\nit up.  I made it big and strong and great. It's mine, by heaven!\nMINE!  And no man shall take it from me!\"\n\nHe was sitting up, his face flushed, his eyes blazing.  \"Gad--he does\nlook a wild beast!\" said Langdon to himself.  He would have said aloud,\nhad Dumont been well:  \"I'm precious glad I ain't the creature those\nfangs are reaching for!\"  He was about to caution him against exciting\nhimself when Dumont sank back with a cynical smile at his own outburst.\n\n\"But to get down to business,\" he went on.  \"I've eleven millions of\nthe stock left--about a hundred and twenty thousand shares.  Gladys has\nfifty thousand shares--how much have you got?\"\n\n\"Less than ten thousand.  And I'd have had none at all if my mind\nhadn't been full of other things as I was sailing.  I forgot to tell my\nbroker to sell.\"\n\nDumont was reflecting.  Presently he said:  \"Those curs not only took\nmost of my stock and forced the sale of most of my other securities;\nthey've put me in such a light that outside stockholders wouldn't send\nme their proxies now.  To get back control I must smash them, and I\nmust also acquire pretty nearly half the shares, and hold them till I'm\nfirm in the saddle again.\"\n\n\"You'd better devote yourself for the present to escaping the grave.\nWhy bother about business?  You've got enough--too much, as it is.\nTake a holiday--go away and amuse yourself.\"\n\n\nDumont smiled.  \"That's what I'm going to do, what I'm doing--amusing\nmyself.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't live, if I didn't feel that I was\non my way back to power.  Now--in the present market I couldn't borrow\non my Woolens stock.  I've two requests to make of you.\"\n\n\"Anything that's possible.\"\n\n\"The first is, I want you to lend me four millions, or, rather,\nnegotiate the loan for me, as if it were for yourself.  I've got about\nthat amount in Governments, in several good railways and in the\nproperty here.  The place at Saint X is Pauline's, but the things I can\nput up would bring four millions and a half at least at forced sale.\nSo, you'll be well secured.  I'm asking you to do it instead of doing\nit myself because, if I'm to win out, the Herron crowd must think I'm\ndone for and nearly dead.\"\n\nLangdon was silent several minutes.  At last he said:  \"What's your\nplan?\"\n\nDumont looked irritated--he did not like to be questioned, to take any\none into his confidence.  But he restrained his temper and said:  \"I'm\ngoing to make a counter-raid.  I know where to strike.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\nDumont frowned.  \"Don't disturb yourself,\" he said coldly.  \"I can\narrange the loan in another way.\"\n\n\"I'm asking you only for your own sake, Jack,\" Langdon hastily\ninterposed.  \"Of course you can have the money, and I don't want your\nsecurity.\"\n\n\"Then I'll not borrow through you.\"  Dumont never would accept a favor\nfrom any one.  He regarded favors as profitable investments but ruinous\ndebts.\n\n\"Oh--very well--I'll take the security,\" said Langdon.  \"When do you\nwant the money?\"\n\n\"It must be covered into my account at the Inter-State\nNational--remember, NOT the National Industrial, but the Inter-State\nNational.  A million must be deposited to-day--the rest by ten o'clock\nto-morrow at the latest.\"\n\n\"I'll attend to it.  What's your other request?\"\n\n\"Woolens'll take another big drop on Monday and at least two hundred\nand fifty thousand shares'll be thrown on the market at perhaps an\naverage price of eighteen--less rather than more.  I want you quietly\nto organize a syndicate to buy what's offered. They must agree to sell\nit to me for, say, two points advance on what they pay for it.  I'll\nput up--in your name--a million dollars in cash and forfeit it if I\ndon't take the stock off their hands.  As Woolens is worth easily\ndouble what it now stands at, they can't lose.  Of course the whole\nthing must be kept secret.\"\n\nLangdon deliberated this proposal.  Finally he said:  \"I think\nbrother-in-law Barrow and his partner and I can manage it.\"\n\n\"You can assure them they'll make from six hundred thousand to a\nmillion on a less than thirty days' investment of four millions and a\nhalf, with no risk whatever.\"\n\n\"Just about that,\" assented Langdon--he had been carefully brought up\nby his father to take care of a fortune and was cleverer at figures\nthan he pretended.\n\n\"Do your buying through Tavistock,\" continued Dumont.  \"Give him orders\nto take on Monday all offerings of National Woolens, preferred and\ncommon, at eighteen or less.  He'll understand what to do.\"\n\n\"But I may be unable to get up the syndicate on such short notice.\"\n\n\"You must,\" said Dumont.  \"And you will.  You can get a move on\nyourself when you try--I found that out when I was organizing my\noriginal combine.  One thing more--very important.  Learn for me all\nyou can--without being suspected--about the Fanning-Smiths and Great\nLakes.\"\n\nHe made Langdon go over the matters he was to attend to, point by\npoint, before he would let him leave.  He was asleep when the nurse,\nsent in by Langdon on his way out, reached his bed--the sound and\npeaceful sleep of a veteran campaigner whose nerves are trained to take\nadvantage of every lull.\n\nAt ten the next morning he sent the nurse out of his room.  \"And close\nthe doors,\" he said, \"and don't come until I ring.\"  He began to use\nthe branch telephone at his bedside, calling up Langdon, and then\nTavistock, to assure himself that all was going well.  Next he called\nup in succession five of the great individual money-lenders of Wall\nStreet, pledged them to secrecy and made arrangements for them to call\nupon him at his house at different hours that day and Sunday.  Another\nmight have intrusted the making of these arrangements to Culver or\nLangdon, but Dumont never let any one man know enough of his plan of\nbattle to get an idea of the whole.\n\n\"Now for the ammunition,\" he muttered, when the last appointment was\nmade.  And he rang for Culver.\n\nCulver brought him writing materials.  \"Take this order,\" he said, as\nhe wrote, \"to the Central Park Safety Deposit vaults and bring me from\nmy compartment the big tin box with my initials in white--remember, IN\nWHITE--on the end of it.\"\n\nThree-quarters of an hour later Culver returned, half-carrying,\nhalf-dragging the box.  Dumont's eyes lighted up at sight of it. \"Ah!\"\nhe said, in a sigh of satisfaction and relief.  \"Put it under the head\nof the bed here.  Thanks.  That's all.\"\n\nThe nurse came as Culver left, but he sent her away.  He supported\nhimself to the door, locked it.  He took his keys from the night-stand,\ndrew out the box and opened it.  On the mass of stocks and bonds lay an\nenvelope containing two lists--one, of the securities in the box that\nwere the property of Gladys Dumont; the other, of the securities there\nthat were the property of Laura Dumont, their mother.\n\nHis hands shook as he unfolded these lists, and a creaking in the walls\nor flooring made him start and glance round with the look of a\nsurprised thief.  But this weakness was momentary.  He was soon\nabsorbed in mentally arranging the securities to the best advantage for\ndistribution among the money-lenders as collateral for the cash he\npurposed to stake in his game.\n\nSuch thought as he gave to the moral quality of what he was doing with\nhis sister's and his mother's property without asking their consent was\naltogether favorable to himself.  His was a well-trained, \"practical\"\nconscience.  It often anticipated his drafts upon it for moral support\nin acts that might at first blush seem criminal, or for soothing\napologies for acts which were undeniably \"not QUITE right.\"  This\nparticular act, conscience assured him, was of the highest\nmorality--under his own code.  For the code enacted by ordinary human\nbeings to guide their foolish little selves he had no more respect than\na lion would have for a moral code enacted by and for sheep.  The sheep\nmight assert that their code was for lions also; but why should that\nmove the lions to anything but amusement?  He had made his own\ncode--not by special revelation from the Almighty, as did some of his\nfellow practitioners of high finance, but by especial command of his\nimperial \"destiny.\"  And it was a strict code--it had earned him his\nunblemished reputation for inflexible commercial honesty and commercial\ntruthfulness.  The foundation principle was his absolute right to the\ngreat property he had created.  This being granted, how could there be\nimmorality in any act whatsoever that might be necessary to hold or\nregain his kingdom?  As well debate the morality of a mother in\n\"commandeering\" bread or even a life to save her baby from death.\n\nHis kingdom!  His by discovery, his by adroit appropriation, his by\nintelligent development, his by the right of mental might--HIS!  Stake\nhis sister's and his mother's possessions for it?  Their lives, if\nnecessary!\n\nThan John Dumont, president of the Woolens Monopoly, there was no\nfirmer believer in the gospel of divine right--the divine right of this\nnew race of kings, the puissant lords of trade.\n\nWhen he had finished his preparations for the money-lenders he unlocked\nthe door and sank into bed exhausted.  Hardly had he settled himself\nwhen, without knocking, Gladys entered, Pauline just behind her.  His\nface blanched and from his dry throat came a hoarse, strange cry--it\ncertainly sounded like fright.  \"You startled me--that was all,\" he\nhastened to explain, as much to himself as to them.  For, a something\ninside him had echoed the wondering inquiry in the two women's faces--a\nsomething that persisted in reverencing the moral code which his new\ncode had superseded.\n\n\n\nXXVII.\n\nTHE OTHER MAN'S MIGHT.\n\nAt eleven o'clock on Monday morning James, head of the Fanning-Smith\nfamily, president of Fanning-Smith and Company, and chairman of the\nGreat Lakes and Gulf railway--to note his chief titles to eminence\nup-town and down--was seated in his grandfather's office, in his\ngrandfather's chair, at his grandfather's desk.  Above his head hung\nhis grandfather's portrait; and he was a slightly modernized\nreproduction of it. As he was thus in every outward essential his\ngrandfather over again, he and his family and the social and business\nworld assumed that he was the reincarnation of the crafty old fox who\nfirst saw the light of day through the chinks in a farm-hand's cottage\nin Maine and last saw it as it sifted through the real-lace curtains of\nhis gorgeous bedroom in his great Madison Avenue mansion.  But in fact\nJames was only physically and titularly the representative of his\ngrandfather.  Actually he was typical of the present generation of\nFanning-Smiths--a self-intoxicated, stupid and pretentious generation;\na polo-playing and racing and hunting, a yachting and palace-dwelling\nand money-scattering generation; a business-despising and\nbusiness-neglecting, an old-world aristocracy-imitating generation.  He\nmoved pompously through his two worlds, fashion and business, deceiving\nhimself completely, every one else except his wife more or less, her\nnot at all--but that was the one secret she kept.\n\nJames was the husband of Herron's daughter by his first wife, and\nHerron had induced him to finance the syndicate that had raided and\ncaptured National Woolens.\n\nJames was bred to conservatism.  His timidity was of that wholesome\nstrength which so often saves chuckle-heads from the legitimate\nconsequences of their vanity and folly.  But the spectacle of huge\nfortunes, risen overnight before the wands of financial magicians whose\nabilities he despised when he compared them with his own, was too much\nfor timidity.  He had been born with a large vanity, and it had been\nstuffed from his babyhood by all around him until it was become as\nabnormal as the liver of a Strasburg goose--and as supersensitive.  It\nsuffered acutely as these Jacks went climbing up their bean-stalk\nwealth to heights of magnificence from which the establishments and\nequipages of the Fanning-Smiths must seem poor to shabbiness.  He\nsneered at them as \"vulgar new-comers\"; he professed abhorrence of\ntheir ostentation.  But he--and Gertrude, his wife--envied them, talked\nof them constantly, longed to imitate, to surpass them.\n\nIn the fullness of time his temptation came.  He shivered, shrank,\nleaped headlong--his wife pushing.\n\nAbout ten days before the raid on National Woolens there had drifted in\nto Dumont through one of his many subterranean sources of information a\nrumor that the Fanning-Smiths had stealthily reduced their holdings of\nGreat Lakes to twenty-one thousand shares and that the property was not\nso good as it had once been. He never permitted any Wall Street\ndevelopment to pass unexplained--he thought it simple prudence for a\nman with the care of a great financial and commercial enterprise to\nlook into every dark corner of the Street and see what was hatching\nthere. Accordingly, he sent an inquiry back along his secret avenue.\nSoon he learned that Great Lakes was sound, but the Fanning-Smiths had\ngone rotten; that they were gambling in the stock of the road they\ncontrolled and were supposed in large part to own; that they were\nsecretly selling its stock \"short\"--that is, were betting it would go\ndown--when there was nothing in the condition of the property to\njustify a fall.  He reflected on this situation and reached these\nconclusions:  \"James Fanning-Smith purposes to pass the autumn\ndividend, which will cause the stock to drop.  Then he will take his\nprofits from the shares he has sold short and will buy back control at\nthe low price.  He is a fool and a knave.  Only an imbecile would thus\ntrifle with an established property.  A chance for some one to make a\nfortune and win a railroad by smashing the Fanning-Smiths.\"  Having\nrecorded in his indelible memory these facts and conclusions as to\nJames Fanning-Smith's plunge from business into gambling, Dumont\nreturned to his own exacting affairs.\n\nHe had himself begun the race for multi-millions as a gambler and had\nonly recently become ALMOST altogether a business man.  But he thought\nthere was a radical difference between his case and Fanning-Smith's.\nTo use courageous gambling as means to a foothold in business--he\nregarded that as wise audacity.  To use a firm-established foothold in\nbusiness as a means to gambling--he regarded that as the acme of\nreckless folly. Besides, when he marked the cards or loaded the dice\nfor a great Wall Street game of \"high finance,\" he did it with skill\nand intelligence; and Fanning-Smith had neither.\n\nWhen the banking-house of Fanning-Smith and Company undertook to\nfinance the raid on National Woolens it was already deep in the Great\nLakes gamble.  James was new to Wall Street's green table; and he liked\nthe sensations and felt that his swindle on other gamblers and the\npublic--he did not call it by that homely name, though he knew others\nwould if they found him out--was moving smoothly.  Still very, very\ndeep down his self-confidence was underlaid with quicksand.  But Herron\nwas adroit and convincing to the degree attainable only by those who\ndeceive themselves before trying to deceive others; and James' cupidity\nand conceit were enormous.  He ended by persuading himself that his\nhouse, directed and protected by his invincible self, could carry with\nease the burden of both loads.  Indeed, the Great Lakes gamble now\nseemed to him a negligible trifle in the comparison--what were its\nprofits of a few hundred thousands beside the millions that would\nsurely be his when the great Woolens Monopoly, bought in for a small\nfraction of its value, should be controlled by a group of which he\nwould be the dominant personality?\n\nHe ventured; he won.  He was now secure--was not Dumont dispossessed,\ndespoiled, dying?\n\nAt eleven o'clock on that Monday morning he was seated upon his\nembossed leather throne, under his grandfather's portrait, immersed in\nan atmosphere of self-adoration.  At intervals he straightened himself,\ndistended his chest, elevated his chin and glanced round with an air of\nhaughty dignity, though there was none to witness and to be impressed.\nIn Wall Street there is a fatuity which, always epidemic among the\nsmall fry, infects wise and foolish, great and small, whenever a\nparetic dream of an enormous haul at a single cast of the net happens\nto come true. This paretic fatuity now had possession of James; in\nimagination he was crowning and draping himself with multi-millions,\npower and fame.  At intervals he had been calling up on the telephone\nat his elbow Zabriskie, the firm's representative on 'Change, and had\nbeen spurring him on to larger and more frequent \"sales\" of Great Lakes.\n\n\nHis telephone bell rang.  He took down the receiver--\"Yes, it's Mr.\nFanning-Smith--oh--Mr. Fanshaw----\"  He listened, in his face for the\nfirst few seconds all the pitying amusement a small, vain man can put\ninto an expression of superiority.  \"Thank you, Mr. Fanshaw,\" he said.\n\"But really, it's impossible.  WE are perfectly secure.  No one would\nventure to disturb US.\"  And he pursed his lips and swelled his fat\ncheeks in the look for which his father was noted.  But, after\nlistening a few seconds longer, his eyes had in them the beginnings of\ntimidity.\n\nHe turned his head so that he could see the ticker-tape as it reeled\noff.  His heavy cheeks slowly relaxed.  \"Yes, yes,\" he said hurriedly.\n\n\"I'll just speak to our Mr. Zabriskie.  Good-by.\"  And he rang off and\nhad his telephone connected with the telephone Zabriskie was using at\nthe Stock Exchange.  All the while his eyes were on the ticker-tape.\nSuddenly he saw upon it where it was bending from under the turning\nwheel a figure that made him drop the receiver and seize it in both his\ntrembling hands.  \"Great heavens!\" he gasped.  \"Fanshaw may be right.\nGreat Lakes one hundred and twelve--and only a moment ago it was one\nhundred and three.\"\n\nHis visions of wealth and power and fame were whisking off in a gale of\nterror.  A new quotation was coming from under the wheel--Great Lakes\none hundred and fifteen.  In his eyes stared the awful thought that was\nraging in his brain--\"This may mean----\"  And his vanity instantly\nthrust out Herron and Gertrude and pointed at them as the criminals who\nwould be responsible if--he did not dare formulate the possibilities of\nthat bounding price.\n\nThe telephone boy at the other end, going in search of Zabriskie, left\nthe receiver off the hook and the door of the booth open. Into\nFanning-Smith's ear came the tumult from the floor of the\nExchange--shrieks and yells riding a roar like the breakers of an\ninfernal sea.  And on the ticker-tape James was reading the story of\nthe cause, was reading how his Great Lakes venture was caught in those\nbreakers, was rushing upon the rocks amid the despairing wails of its\ncrew, the triumphant jeers of the wreckers on shore. Great Lakes one\nhundred and eighteen--tick--tick--tick--Great Lakes one hundred and\ntwenty-three--tick--tick--tick--Great Lakes one hundred and\nthirty--tick--tick--tick--Great Lakes one hundred and thirty-five--\n\n\"It can't be true!\" he moaned.  \"It CAN'T be true!  If it is I'm\nruined--all of us ruined!\"\n\nThe roar in the receiver lessened--some one had entered the booth at\nthe other end and had closed the door.  \"Well!\" he heard in a sharp,\nimpatient voice--Zabriskie's.\n\n\"What is it, Ned--what's the matter?  Why didn't you tell me?\"\nFanning-Smith's voice was like the shrill shriek of a coward in a\nperilous storm.  It was in itself complete explanation of Zabriskie's\nneglect to call upon him for orders.\n\n\"Don't ask me.  Somebody's rocketing Great Lakes--taking all offerings.\nDon't keep me here.  I'm having a hard enough time, watching this crazy\nmarket and sending our orders by the roundabout way.  Got anything to\nsuggest?\"\n\nTick--tick--tick--Commander-in-chief Fanning-Smith watched the crawling\ntape in fascinated horror--Great Lakes one hundred and thirty-eight.\nIt had spelled out for him another letter of that hideous word, Ruin.\nAll the moisture of his body seemed to be on the outside; inside, he\nwas dry and hot as a desert.  If the price went no higher, if it did\nnot come down, nearly all he had in the world would be needed to settle\nhis \"short\" contracts. For he would have to deliver at one hundred and\nseven, more than two hundred thousand shares which he had contracted to\nsell; and to get them for delivery he would have to pay one hundred and\nthirty-eight dollars a share.  A net loss of more than six millions!\n\n\"You must get that price down--you must!  You MUST!\" quavered James.\n\n\"Hell!\" exclaimed Zabriskie--he was the youngest member of the firm, a\nson of James' oldest sister.  \"Tell me how, and I'll do it.\"\n\n\"You're there--you know what to do,\" pleaded James.  \"And I order you\nto get that price down!\"\n\n\"Don't keep me here, talking rot.  I've been fighting--and I'm going to\nkeep on.\"\n\nJames shivered.  Fighting!  There was no fight in him--all his life he\nhad got everything without fighting.  \"Do your best,\" he said.  \"I'm\nvery ill to-day.  I'm--\"\n\n\"Good-by--\" Zabriskie had hung up the receiver.\n\nJames sat staring at the tape like a paralytic staring at death. The\nminutes lengthened into an hour--into two hours.  No one disturbed\nhim--when the battle is on who thinks of the \"honorary commander\"?  At\none o'clock he shook himself, brushed his hand over his\neyes--quotations of Woolens were reeling off the tape, alternating with\nquotations of Great Lakes.\n\n\"Zabriskie is selling our Woolens,\" he thought.  Then, with a blinding\nflash the truth struck through his brain.  He gave a loud cry between a\nsob and a shriek and, flinging his arms at full length upon his desk,\nburied his face between them and burst into tears.\n\n\"Ruined!  Ruined!  Ruined!\"  And his shoulders, his whole body, shook\nlike a child in a paroxysm.\n\nA long, long ring at the telephone.  Fanning-Smith, irritated by the\ninsistent jingling so close to his ear, lifted himself and\nanswered--the tears were guttering his swollen face; his lips and\neyelids were twitching.\n\n\"Well?\" he said feebly.\n\n\"We've got 'em on the run,\" came the reply in Zabriskie's voice,\njubilant now.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Don't know who--whoever was trying to squeeze us.  I had to throw over\nsome Woolens--but I'll pick it up again--maybe to-day.\"\n\nFanning-Smith could hear the roar of the Exchange--wilder, fiercer than\nthree hours before, but music to him now.  He looked sheepishly at the\nportrait of his grandfather.  When its eyes met his he flushed and\nshifted his gaze guiltily.  \"Must have been something I ate for\nbreakfast,\" he muttered to the portrait and to himself in apologetic\nexplanation of his breakdown.\n\n\nIn a distant part of the field all this time was posted the\ncommander-in-chief of the army of attack.  Like all wise commanders in\nall well-conducted battles, he was far removed from the blinding smoke,\nfrom the distracting confusion.  He had placed himself where he could\nhear, see, instantly direct, without being disturbed by trifling\nreverse or success, by unimportant rumors to vast proportions blown.\n\nTo play his game for dominion or destruction John Dumont had had\nhimself arrayed in a wine-colored, wadded silk dressing-gown over his\nwhite silk pajamas and had stretched himself on a divan in his\nsitting-room in his palace.  A telephone and a stock-ticker within easy\nreach were his field-glasses and his aides--the stock-ticker would show\nhim second by second the precise posture of the battle; the telephone\nwould enable him to direct it to the minutest manoeuver.\n\nThe telephone led to the ear of his chief of staff, Tavistock, who was\nat his desk in his privatest office in the Mills Building, about him\ntelephones straight to the ears of the division commanders.  None of\nthese knew who was his commander; indeed, none knew that there was to\nbe a battle or, after the battle was on, that they were part of one of\nits two contending armies.  They would blindly obey orders, ignorant\nwho was aiming the guns they fired and at whom those guns were aimed.\nSuch conditions would have been fatal to the barbaric struggles for\nsupremacy which ambition has waged through all the past; they are ideal\nconditions for these modern conflicts of the market which more and more\nabsorb the ambitions of men.  Instead of shot and shell and regiments\nof \"cannon food,\" there are battalions of capital, the paper\ncertificates of the stored-up toil or trickery of men; instead of\nmangled bodies and dead, there are minds in the torment of financial\nperil or numb with the despair of financial ruin.  But the stakes are\nthe same old stakes--power and glory and wealth for a few, thousands on\nthousands dragged or cozened into the battle in whose victory they\nshare scantily, if at all, although they bear its heaviest losses on\nboth sides.\n\nIt was half-past eight o'clock when Dumont put the receiver to his ear\nand greeted Tavistock in a strong, cheerful voice. \"Never felt better\nin my life,\" was his answer to Tavistock's inquiry as to his health.\n\"Even old Sackett admits I'm in condition.  But he says I must have no\nirritations--so, be careful to carry out orders.\"\n\nHe felt as well as he said.  His body seemed the better for its rest\nand purification, for its long freedom from his occasional but terrific\nassaults upon it, for having got rid of the superfluous flesh which had\nbeen swelling and weighting it.\n\nHe made Tavistock repeat all the orders he had given him, to assure\nhimself he had not been misunderstood.  As he listened to the rehearsal\nof his own shrewd plans his eyes sparkled.  \"I'll bag the last----of\nthem,\" he muttered, and his lips twisted into a smile at which Culver\nwinced.\n\nWhen the ticker clicked the first quotation of Great Lakes Dumont said:\n\"Now, clear out, Culver!  And shut the door after you, and let no one\ninterrupt me until I call.\"  He wished to have no restraint upon his\nthoughts, no eyes to watch his face, no ears to hear what the fortune\nof the battle might wring from him.\n\nAs the ticker pushed out the news of the early declines and recoveries\nin Great Lakes, Tavistock leading the Fanning-Smith crowd on to make\nheavier and heavier plunges, Dumont could see in imagination the\nbattle-field--the floor of the Stock Exchange--as plainly as if he were\nthere.\n\nThe battle began with a languid cannonade between the two seemingly\nopposed parts of Dumont's army.  Under cover of this he captured most\nof the available actual shares of Great Lakes--valuable aids toward\nmaking his position, his \"corner,\" impregnable.  But before he had\naccomplished his full purpose Zabriskie, nominal lieutenant-commander,\nactual commander of the Fanning-Smith forces, advanced to give battle.\nInstead of becoming suspicious at the steadiness of the price under his\nattacks upon it, Zabriskie was lured on to sell more of those Great\nLakes shares which he did not have.  And he beamed from his masked\nposition as he thought of the batteries he was holding in reserve for\nhis grand movement to batter down the price of the stock late in the\nday, and capture these backers of the property that was supposed to be\nunder the protection of the high and honorable Fanning-Smiths.\n\nHe was still thinking along this line, as he stood aloof and apparently\ndisinterested, when Dumont began to close in upon him. Zabriskie,\nastonished by this sudden tremendous fire, was alarmed when under its\nprotection the price advanced.  He assaulted in force with large\nselling orders; but the price pushed on and the fierce cannonade of\nlarger and larger buying orders kept up. When Great Lakes had mounted\nin a dozen bounds from one hundred and seven to one hundred and\nthirty-nine, he for the first time realized that he was facing not an\nunorganized speculating public but a compact army, directed by a single\nmind to a single purpose.  \"A lunatic--a lot of lunatics,\" he said,\nhaving not the faintest suspicion of the reason for the creation of\nthese conditions of frenzy.  Still, if this rise continued or was not\nreversed the Fanning-Smiths would be ruined--by whom?  \"Some of those\nChicago bluffers,\" he finally decided.  \"I must throw a scare into I\nthem.\"\n\nHe could have withdrawn from the battle then with a pitiful remnant of\nthe Fanning-Smiths and their associates--that is, he thought he could,\nfor he did not dream of the existence of the \"corner.\"  But he chose\nthe opposite course.  He flung off his disguise and boldly attacked the\nstock with selling orders openly in the name of the Fanning-Smiths.\n\n\"When they see us apparently unloading our own ancestral property I\nthink they'll take to their heels,\" he said.  But his face was pale as\nhe awaited the effect of his assault.\n\nThe price staggered, trembled.  The clamor of the battle alarmed those\nin the galleries of the Stock Exchange--Zabriskie's brokers selling,\nthe brokers of the mysterious speculator buying, the speculating public\nthrough its brokers joining in on either side; men shrieking into each\nother's faces as they danced round and round the Great Lakes pillar.\nThe price went down, went up, went down, down, down--Zabriskie had\nhurled selling orders for nearly fifty thousand shares at it and Dumont\nhad commanded his guns to cease firing.  He did not dare take any more\nofferings; he had reached the end of the ammunition he had planned to\nexpend at that particular stage of the battle.\n\nThe alarm spread and, although Zabriskie ceased selling, the price\ncontinued to fall under the assaults of the speculating public, mad to\nget rid of that which its own best friends were so eagerly and so\nfrankly throwing over.  Down, down, down to one hundred and twenty, to\none hundred and ten, to one hundred and five----\n\nZabriskie telephoned victory to his nominal commander, lifting him,\nweak and trembling, from the depths into which he had fallen, to an at\nleast upright position upon his embossed leather throne.  Then\nZabriskie began stealthily to cover his appallingly long line of\n\"shorts\" by making purchases at the lowest obtainable prices--one\nhundred and four--one hundred and three--one hundred and\none--ninety-nine--one hundred and six!\n\nThe price rebounded so rapidly and so high that Zabriskie was forced to\nstop his retreat.  Dumont, noting the celerity with which the enemy\nwere escaping under cover of the demoralization, had decided no longer\nto delay the move for which he had saved himself.  He had suddenly\nexploded under the falling price mine after mine of buying orders that\nblew it skyward.  Zabriskie's retreat was cut off.\n\nBut before he had time to reason out this savage renewal of the assault\nby that mysterious foe whom he thought he had routed, he saw a new and\nmore dreadful peril.  Brackett, his firm's secret broker, rushed to him\nand, to make himself heard through the hurly-burly, shouted into his\near:\n\n\"Look what's doing in Woolens!\"\n\nDumont had ordered a general assault upon his enemies, front, rear and\nboth flanks.  His forces were now attacking not only through Great\nLakes but also through Woolens.  Two apparently opposing sets of his\nbrokers were trading in Woolens, were hammering the price down, down, a\npoint, an eighth, a half, a quarter, at a time.  The sweat burst out\nall over Zabriskie's body and his eyes rolled wildly.  He was caught\namong four fires:\n\nTo continue to sell Great Lakes in face of its rising price--that was\nruin.  To cease to sell it and so let its price go up to where he could\nnot buy when settlement time came--that was ruin. To sell Woolens, to\nhelp batter down its price, to shrink the value of his enormous\ninvestment in it--ruin again.  To buy Woolens in order to hold up its\nprice, to do it when he would need all obtainable cash to extricate him\nfrom the Great Lakes entanglement--ruin, certain ruin.\n\nHis judgment was gone; his brute instinct of fighting was dominant; he\nbegan to strike out wildly, his blows falling either nowhere or upon\nhimself.\n\nAt the Woolens post he was buying in the effort to sustain its price,\nbuying stock that might be worthless when he got it--and that he might\nnot be able to pay for.  At the Great Lakes post he was selling in the\neffort to force the price down, selling more and more of a stock he did\nnot have and----  At last the thought flashed into his befuddled brain:\n\"There may be a corner in Great Lakes.  What if there were no stock to\nbe had?\"\n\nHe struck his hands against the sides of his head.  \"Trapped!\" he\ngroaned, then bellowed in Brackett's ear.  \"Sell Woolens--do the best\nyou can to keep the price up, but sell at any price!  We must have\nmoney--all we can get!  And tell Farley\"--Farley was Brackett's\npartner--\"to buy Great Lakes--buy all he can get--at any price.\nSomebody's trying to corner us!\"\n\nHe felt--with an instinct he could not question--that there was indeed\na corner in Great Lakes, that he and his house and their associates\nwere caught.  Caught with promises to deliver thousands upon thousands\nof shares of Great Lakes, when Great Lakes could be had only of the\nmysterious cornerer, and at whatever price he might choose to ask!\n\n\"If we've got to go down,\" he said to himself, \"I'll see that it's a\ntremendous smash anyhow, and that we ain't alone in it.\" For he had in\nhim the stuff that makes a man lead a forlorn hope with a certain joy\nin the very hopelessness of it.\n\nThe scene on the day of Dumont's downfall was a calm in comparison with\nthe scene which Dumont, sitting alone among the piled-up coils of\nticker-tape, was reconstructing from its, to him, vivid\nsecond-by-second sketchings.\n\nThe mysterious force which had produced a succession of earthquakes\nmoved horribly on, still in mystery impenetrable, to produce a\ncataclysm.  In the midst of the chaos two vast whirlpools formed--one\nwhere Great Lakes sucked down men and fortunes, the other where Woolens\ndrew some down to destruction, flung others up to wealth.  Then Rumor,\nreleased by Tavistock when Dumont saw that the crisis had arrived, ran\nhot foot through the Exchange, screaming into the ears of the brokers,\nshrieking through the telephones, howling over the telegraph wires, \"A\ncorner!  A corner!  Great Lakes is cornered!\"  Thousands besides the\nFanning-Smith coterie had been gambling in Great Lakes, had sold shares\nthey did not have.  And now all knew that to get them they must go to\nthe unknown, but doubtless merciless, master-gambler--unless they could\nsave themselves by instantly buying elsewhere before the steel jaws of\nthe corner closed and clinched.\n\nReason fled, and self-control.  The veneer of civilization was torn\naway to the last shred; and men, turned brute again, gave themselves up\nto the elemental passions of the brute.\n\nIn the quiet, beautiful room in upper Fifth Avenue was Dumont in his\nwine-colored wadded silk dressing-gown and white silk pajamas.  The\nfloor near his lounge was littered with the snake-like coils of\nticker-tape.  They rose almost to his knees as he sat and through\ntelephone and ticker drank in the massacre of his making, glutted\nhimself with the joy of the vengeance he was taking--on his enemies, on\nhis false or feeble friends, on the fickle public that had trampled and\nspat upon him.  His wet hair was hanging in strings upon his forehead.\nHis face was flushed and his green-gray eyes gleamed like a mad dog's.\nAt intervals a jeer or a grunt of gratified appetite ripped from his\nmouth or nose.  Like a great lean spider he lay hid in the center of\nthat vast net of electric wires, watching his prey writhe helpless.\nPauline, made uneasy by his long isolation, opened his door and\nlooked--glanced, rather.  As she closed it, in haste to shut from view\nthat spectacle of a hungry monster at its banquet of living flesh,\nCulver saw her face.  Such an expression an angel might have, did it\nchance to glance down from the battlements of heaven and, before it\ncould turn away, catch a glimpse of some orgy in hell.\n\nBut Dumont did not hear the door open and close.  He was at the climax\nof his feast.\n\nUpon his two maelstroms, sucking in the wreckage from a dozen other\nexplosions as well as from those he had directly caused, he could see\nas well as if he were among the fascinated, horrified spectators in the\ngalleries of the Exchange, the mangled flotsam whirling and descending\nand ascending.  The entire stock list, the entire speculating public of\nthe country was involved.  And expression of the emotions everywhere\nwas by telegraph and telephone concentrated in the one hall, upon the\nfaces and bodies of those few hundred brokers.  All the passions which\nlove of wealth and dread of want breed in the human animal were there\nfinding vent--all degrees and shades and modes of greed, of hate, of\nfear, of despair.  It was like a shipwreck where the whole fleet is\nflung upon the reefs, and the sailors, drunk and insane, struggle with\ndeath each in his own awful way.  It was like the rout where frenzied\nvictors ride after and among frenzied vanquished to shoot and stab and\nsaber.\n\nAnd while this battle, precipitated by the passions of a few \"captains\nof industry,\" raged in Wall Street and filled the nation with the\nclamor of ruined or triumphant gamblers, ten-score thousand toilers in\nthe two great enterprises directly involved toiled tranquilly\non--herding sheep and shearing them, weaving cloths and dyeing them,\ndriving engines, handling freight, conducting trains, usefully busy,\nadding to the sum of human happiness, subtracting from the sum of human\nmisery.\n\n\nAt three o'clock Dumont sank back among his cushions and pillows. His\nchild, his other self, his Woolens Monopoly, was again his own; his\nenemies were under his heel, as much so as those heaps and coils of\nticker-tape he had been churning in his excitement. \"I'm dead tired,\"\nhe muttered, his face ghastly, his body relaxed in utter exhaustion.\n\nHe closed his eyes.  \"I must sleep--I've earned it. To-morrow\"--a smile\nflitted round his mouth--\"I'll hang their hides where every coyote and\nvulture can see.\"\n\nToward four o'clock in came Doctor Sackett and Culver.  The room was\nflooded with light--the infinite light of the late-spring afternoon\nreflected on the white enamel and white brocade of walls and furniture.\nOn the floor in the heaps and coils of ticker-tape lay Dumont.\n\nIn his struggles the tape had wound round and round his legs, his arms,\nhis neck.  It lay in a curling, coiling mat, like a serpent's head,\nupon his throat, where his hands clutched the collar of his pajamas.\n\nSackett knelt beside him, listening at his chest, feeling for his pulse\nin vain.  And Culver stood by, staring stupidly at the now worthless\ninstrument of his ambition for wealth and power.\n\n\n\nXXVIII.\n\nAFTER THE LONG WINTER.\n\nWithin two hours Langdon, in full control, had arranged with Tavistock\nto make the imperiled victory secure.  Thus, not until the next day but\none did it come out that the cataclysm had been caused by a man ruined\nand broken and with his back against death's door to hold it shut; that\nDumont himself had turned the triumphing host of his enemies into a\nflying mob, in its panic flinging away its own possessions as well as\nits booty.\n\nPerhaps the truth never would have been known, perhaps Langdon would\nhave bribed Tavistock to silence and would have posed as the conquering\ngenius, had he found out a day earlier how Dumont had put himself in\nfunds.  As it was, this discovery did not come too late for him to\nseize the opportunity that was his through Dumont's secret methods,\nPauline's indifference to wealth and his own unchecked authority.  He\nhas got many an hour of--strictly private--mental gymnastics out of the\nmoral problem he saw, in his keeping for himself and Gladys the spoils\nhe gathered up.  He is inclined to think he was intelligent rather than\nright; but, knowing his weakness for self-criticism, he never gives a\npositive verdict against himself.  That, however, is unimportant, as he\nis not the man to permit conscience to influence conduct in grave\nmatters.\n\nHe feels that, in any case, he did not despoil Pauline or Gardiner.\nFor, after he had told her what Dumont did--and to protect himself he\nhastened to tell it--she said:  \"Whatever there may be, it's all for\nGardiner.  I waive my own rights, if I have any.  But you must give me\nyour word of honor that you won't let anything tainted pass to him.\"\nLangdon, judging with the delicacy of a man of honor put on honor, was\nable to find little such wealth.\n\nHe gives himself most of the credit for Gardiner's turning out so\nwell--\"Inherited riches are a hopeless handicap,\" he often says to\nGladys when they are talking over the future of their children.\n\nPauline--\n\nThe first six months of her new life, of her resumed life, she spent in\nEurope with her father and mother and Gardiner.  Late in the fall they\nwere back at Saint X, at the old house in Jefferson Street.  In the\nfollowing June came Scarborough.  She was in the garden, was waiting\nfor him, was tying up a tall rose, whose splendid, haughty head had\nbent under the night's rain.\n\nHe was quite near her when she heard his step and turned.  He stood,\nlooked at her--the look she had seen that last afternoon at Battle\nField.  He came slowly up and took both her hands.\n\n\"After all the waiting and longing and hoping,\" he said, \"at last--you!\nI can't put it into words--except to say--just--Pauline!\"\n\nShe drew a long breath; her gaze met his.  And in her eyes he saw a\nflame that had never shone clearly there before--the fire of her own\nreal self, free and proud.  \"Once you told me about your father and\nmother--how he cared--cared always.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" he answered.\n\n\"Well--I--I,\" said Pauline, \"I care as SHE must have cared when she\ngave him herself--and YOU.\"",
