 "text": "THE COUNT’S MILLIONS\n\nBy Emile Gaboriau\n\nTranslated from the French\n\n\nA novel in two parts. Part Two of this novel is found in the volume:\nBaron Trigault’s Vengeance\n\n\n\n\n\nPASCAL AND MARGUERITE.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nIt was a Thursday evening, the fifteenth of October; and although only\nhalf-past six o’clock, it had been dark for some time already. The\nweather was cold, and the sky was as black as ink, while the wind blew\ntempestuously, and the rain fell in torrents.\n\nThe servants at the Hotel de Chalusse, one of the most magnificent\nmansions in the Rue de Courcelles in Paris, were assembled in the\nporter’s lodge, a little building comprising a couple of rooms standing\non the right hand side of the great gateway. Here, as in all large\nmansions, the “concierge” or porter, M. Bourigeau, was a person of\nimmense importance, always able and disposed to make any one who was\ninclined to doubt his authority, feel it in cruel fashion. As could be\neasily seen, he held all the other servants in his power. He could\nlet them absent themselves without leave, if he chose, and conceal all\nreturns late at night after the closing of public balls and wine-shops.\nThus, it is needless to say that M. Bourigeau and his wife were treated\nby their fellow-servants with the most servile adulation.\n\nThe owner of the house was not at home that evening, so that M. Casimir,\nthe count’s head valet, was serving coffee for the benefit of all the\nretainers. And while the company sipped the fragrant beverage which had\nbeen generously tinctured with cognac, provided by the butler, they all\nunited in abusing their common enemy, the master of the house. For the\ntime being, a pert little waiting-maid, with an odious turn-up nose, had\nthe floor. She was addressing her remarks to a big, burly, and rather\ninsolent-looking fellow, who had been added only the evening before to\nthe corps of footmen. “The place is really intolerable,” she was saying.\n“The wages are high, the food of the very best, the livery just such\nas would show off a good-looking man to the best advantage, and Madame\nLeon, the housekeeper, who has entire charge of everything, is not too\nlynx-eyed.”\n\n“And the work?”\n\n“A mere nothing. Think, there are eighteen of us to serve only two\npersons, the count and Mademoiselle Marguerite. But then there is never\nany pleasure, never any amusement here.”\n\n“What! is one bored then?”\n\n“Bored to death. This grand house is worse than a tomb. No receptions,\nno dinners--nothing. Would you believe it, I have never seen the\nreception-rooms! They are always closed; and the furniture is dropping\nto pieces under its coverings. There are not three visitors in the\ncourse of a month.”\n\nShe was evidently incensed, and the new footman seemed to share her\nindignation. “Why, how is it?” he exclaimed. “Is the count an owl? A\nman who’s not yet fifty years old, and who’s said to be worth several\nmillions.”\n\n“Yes, millions; you may safely say it--and perhaps ten, perhaps twenty\nmillions too.”\n\n“Then all the more reason why there should be something going on here.\nWhat does he do with himself alone, all the blessed day?”\n\n“Nothing. He reads in the library, or wanders about the garden.\nSometimes, in the evening, he drives with Mademoiselle Marguerite to the\nBois de Boulogne in a closed carriage; but that seldom happens. Besides,\nthere is no such thing as teasing the poor man. I’ve been in the house\nfor six months, and I’ve never heard him say anything but: ‘yes’; ‘no’;\n‘do this’; ‘very well’; ‘retire.’ You would think these are the only\nwords he knows. Ask M. Casimir if I’m not right.”\n\n“Our guv’nor isn’t very gay, that’s a fact,” responded the valet.\n\nThe footman was listening with a serious air, as if greatly interested\nin the character of the people whom he was to serve. “And mademoiselle,”\n he asked, “what does she say to such an existence?”\n\n“Bless me! during the six months she has been here, she has never once\ncomplained.”\n\n“If she is bored,” added M. Casimir, “she conceals it bravely.”\n\n“Naturally enough,” sneered the waiting-maid, with an ironical gesture;\n“each month that mademoiselle remains here, brings her too much money\nfor her to complain.”\n\nBy the laugh that greeted this reply, and by the looks the older\nservants exchanged, the new-comer must have realized that he had\ndiscovered the secret skeleton hidden in every house. “What! what!” he\nexclaimed, on fire with curiosity; “is there really anything in that? To\ntell the truth, I was inclined to doubt it.”\n\nHis companions were evidently about to tell him all they knew, or rather\nall they thought they knew, when the front-door bell rang vigorously.\n\n“There he comes!” exclaimed the concierge; “but he’s in too much of a\nhurry; hell have to wait awhile.”\n\nHe sullenly pulled the cord, however; the heavy door swayed on its\nhinges, and a cab-driver, breathless and hatless, burst into the room,\ncrying, “Help! help!”\n\nThe servants sprang to their feet.\n\n“Make haste!” continued the driver. “I was bringing a gentleman\nhere--you must know him. He’s outside, in my vehicle----”\n\nWithout pausing to listen any longer, the servants rushed out, and the\ndriver’s incoherent explanation at once became intelligible. At the\nbottom of the cab, a roomy four-wheeler, a man was lying all of a heap,\nspeechless and motionless. He must have fallen forward, face downward,\nand owing to the jolting of the vehicle his head had slipped under the\nfront seat.\n\n“Poor devil!” muttered M. Casimir, “he must have had a stroke of\napoplexy.” The valet was peering into the vehicle as he spoke, and his\ncomrades were approaching, when suddenly he drew back, uttering a cry of\nhorror. “Ah, my God! it is the count!”\n\nWhenever there is an accident in Paris, a throng of inquisitive\nspectators seems to spring up from the very pavement, and indeed more\nthan fifty persons had already congregated round about the vehicle. This\ncircumstance restored M. Casimir’s composure; or, at least, some portion\nof it. “You must drive into the courtyard,” he said, addressing the\ncabman. “M. Bourigeau, open the gate, if you please.” And then, turning\nto another servant, he added:\n\n“And you must make haste and fetch a physician--no matter who. Run to\nthe nearest doctor, and don’t return until you bring one with you.”\n\nThe concierge had opened the gate, but the driver had disappeared; they\ncalled him, and on receiving no reply the valet seized the reins and\nskilfully guided the cab through the gateway.\n\nHaving escaped the scrutiny of the crowd, it now remained to remove the\ncount from the vehicle, and this was a difficult task, on account of the\nsingular position of his body; still, they succeeded at last, by opening\nboth doors of the cab, the three strongest men uniting in their efforts.\nThen they placed him in a large arm-chair, carried him to his own room,\nand speedily had him undressed and in bed.\n\nHe had so far given no sign of life; and as he lay there with his head\nweighing heavily on the pillow, you might have thought that all was\nover. His most intimate friend would scarcely have recognized him. His\nfeatures were swollen and discolored; his eyes were closed, and a dark\npurple circle, looking almost like a terrible bruise, extended round\nthem. A spasm had twisted his lips, and his distorted mouth, which was\ndrawn on one side and hung half open imparted a most sinister expression\nto his face. In spite of every precaution, he had been wounded as he was\nremoved from the cab. His forehead had been grazed by a piece of iron,\nand a tiny stream of blood was trickling down upon his face. However,\nhe still breathed; and by listening attentively, one could distinguish a\nfaint rattling in his throat.\n\nThe servants, who had been so garrulous a few moments before, were\nsilent now. They lingered in the room, exchanging glances of mute\nconsternation. Their faces were pale and sad, and there were tears in\nthe eyes of some of them. What was passing in their minds? Perhaps they\nwere overcome by that unconquerable fear which sudden and unexpected\ndeath always provokes. Perhaps they unconsciously loved this master,\nwhose bread they ate. Perhaps their grief was only selfishness, and they\nwere merely wondering what would become of them, where they should find\nanother situation, and if it would prove a good one. Not knowing what to\ndo, they talked together in subdued voices, each suggesting some remedy\nhe had heard spoken of for such cases. The more sensible among them were\nproposing to go and inform mademoiselle or Madame Leon, whose rooms\nwere on the floor above, when the rustling of a skirt against the door\nsuddenly made them turn. The person whom they called “mademoiselle” was\nstanding on the threshold.\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite was a beautiful young girl, about twenty years\nof age. She was a brunette of medium height, with big gloomy eyes shaded\nby thick eyebrows. Heavy masses of jet-black hair wreathed her lofty but\nrather sad and thoughtful forehead. There was something peculiar in\nher face--an expression of concentrated suffering, and a sort of proud\nresignation, mingled with timidity.\n\n“What has happened?” she asked, gently. “What is the cause of all\nthe noise I have heard? I have rung three times and the bell was not\nanswered.”\n\nNo one ventured to reply, and in her surprise she cast a hasty glance\naround. From where she stood, she could not see the bed stationed in an\nalcove; but she instantly noted the dejected attitude of the servants,\nthe clothing scattered about the floor, and the disorder that pervaded\nthis magnificent but severely furnished chamber, which was only lighted\nby the lamp which M. Bourigeau, the concierge, carried. A sudden dread\nseized her; she shuddered, and in a faltering voice she added: “Why are\nyou all here? Speak, tell me what has happened.”\n\nM. Casimir stepped forward. “A great misfortune, mademoiselle, a\nterrible misfortune. The count----”\n\nAnd he paused, frightened by what he was about to say.\n\nBut Mademoiselle Marguerite had understood him. She clasped both hands\nto her heart, as if she had received a fatal wound, and uttered the\nsingle word: “Lost!”\n\nThe next moment she turned as pale as death, her head drooped, her eyes\nclosed, and she staggered as if about to fall. Two maids sprang forward\nto support her, but she gently repulsed them, murmuring, “Thanks!\nthanks! I am strong now.”\n\nShe was, in fact, sufficiently strong to conquer her weakness. She\nsummoned all her resolution, and, paler than a statue, with set teeth\nand dry, glittering eyes, she approached the alcove. She stood there for\na moment perfectly motionless, murmuring a few unintelligible words; but\nat last, crushed by her sorrow, she sank upon her knees beside the bed,\nburied her face in the counterpane and wept.\n\nDeeply moved by the sight of this despair, the servants held their\nbreath, wondering how it would all end. It ended suddenly. The girl\nsprang from her knees, as if a gleam of hope had darted through her\nheart. “A physician!” she said, eagerly.\n\n“I have sent for one, mademoiselle,” replied M. Casimir. And hearing\na voice and a sound of footsteps on the staircase, he added: “And\nfortunately, here he comes.”\n\nThe doctor entered. He was a young man, although his head was almost\nquite bald. He was short, very thin, clean-shaven, and clad in black\nfrom head to foot. Without a word, without a bow, he walked straight to\nthe bedside, lifted the unconscious man’s eyelids, felt his pulse, and\nuncovered his chest, applying his ear to it. “This is a serious case,”\n he said at the close of his examination.\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite, who had followed his movements with the most\npoignant anxiety, could not repress a sob. “But all hope is not lost,\nis it, monsieur?” she asked in a beseeching voice, with hands clasped\nin passionate entreaty. “You will save him, will you not--you will save\nhim?”\n\n“One may always hope for the best.”\n\nThis was the doctor’s only answer. He had drawn his case of instruments\nfrom his pocket, and was testing the points of his lancets on the tip\nof his finger. When he had found one to his liking: “I must ask you,\nmademoiselle,” said he, “to order these women to retire, and to retire\nyourself. The men will remain to assist me, if I require help.”\n\nShe obeyed submissively, but instead of returning to her own room,\nshe remained in the hall, seating herself upon the lower step of the\nstaircase near the door, counting the seconds, and drawing a thousand\nconjectures from the slightest sound.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the room, the physician was proceeding slowly, not\nfrom temperament however, but from principle. Dr. Jodon--for such was\nhis name--was an ambitious man who played a part. Educated by a “prince\nof science,” more celebrated for the money he gained than for the cures\nhe effected, he copied his master’s method, his gestures, and even the\ninflections of his voice. By casting in people’s eyes the same powder as\nhis teacher had employed, he hoped to obtain the same results: a large\npractice and an immense fortune. In his secret heart he was by no means\ndisconcerted by his patient’s condition; on the contrary, he did not\nconsider the count’s state nearly as precarious as it really was.\n\nBut bleeding and cupping alike failed to bring the sick man to\nconsciousness. He remained speechless and motionless; the only result\nobtained, was that his breathing became a trifle easier. Finding his\nendeavors fruitless, the doctor at last declared that all immediate\nremedies were exhausted, that “the women” might be allowed to return,\nand that nothing now remained but to wait for the effect of the remedies\nhe was about to prescribe, and which they must procure from the nearest\nchemist.\n\nAny other man would have been touched by the agony of entreaty contained\nin the glance that Mademoiselle Marguerite cast upon the physician as\nshe returned into the room; but it did not affect him in the least. He\ncalmly said, “I cannot give my decision as yet.”\n\n“My God!” murmured the unhappy girl; “oh, my God, have mercy upon me!”\n\nBut the doctor, copying his model, had stationed himself near the\nfireplace, with his elbow leaning on the mantel-shelf, in a graceful,\nthough rather pompous attitude. “Now,” he said, addressing his remarks\nto M. Casimir, “I desire to make a few inquiries. Is this the first time\nthe Count de Chalusse has had such an attack?”\n\n“Yes, sir--at least since I have been in attendance upon him.”\n\n“Very good. That is a chance in our favor. Tell me--have you ever heard\nhim complain of vertigo, or of a buzzing in his ears?”\n\n“Never.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite seemed inclined to volunteer some remark, but\nthe doctor imposed silence upon her by a gesture, and continued his\nexamination. “Is the count a great eater?” he inquired. “Does he drink\nheavily?”\n\n“The count is moderation itself, monsieur, and he always takes a great\ndeal of water with his wine.”\n\nThe doctor listened with an air of intent thoughtfulness, his head\nslightly inclined forward, his brow contracted, and his under lip puffed\nout, while from time to time he stroked his beardless chin. He was\ncopying his master. “The devil!” he said, sotto voce. “There must\nbe some cause for such an attack, however. Nothing in the count’s\nconstitution predisposes him to such an accident----” Then, suddenly\nturning toward Mademoiselle Marguerite: “Do you know, mademoiselle,\nwhether the count has experienced any very violent emotion during the\npast few days?”\n\n“Something occurred this very morning, which seemed to annoy him very\nmuch.”\n\n“Ah! now we have it,” said the doctor, with the air of an oracle. “Why\ndid you not tell me all this at first? It will be necessary for you to\ngive me the particulars, mademoiselle.”\n\nThe young girl hesitated. The servants were dazed by the doctor’s\nmanner; but Mademoiselle Marguerite was far from sharing their awe\nand admiration. She would have given anything to have had the regular\nphysician of the household there instead of him! As for this coarse\nexamination in the presence of all these servants, and by the bedside of\na man who, in spite of his apparent unconsciousness, was, perhaps, able\nto hear and to comprehend, she looked upon it as a breach of delicacy,\neven of propriety.\n\n“It is of the most urgent importance that I should be fully informed of\nthese particulars,” repeated the physician peremptorily.\n\nAfter such an assertion, further hesitation was out of the question.\nMademoiselle Marguerite seemed to collect her thoughts, and then she\nsadly said: “Just as we sat down to breakfast this morning, a letter\nwas handed to the count. No sooner had his eyes fallen upon it, than he\nturned as white as his napkin. He rose from his seat and began to walk\nhastily up and down the dining-room, uttering exclamations of anger and\nsorrow. I spoke to him, but he did not seem to hear me. However, after a\nfew moments, he resumed his seat at the table, and began to eat----”\n\n“As usual?”\n\n“He ate more than usual, monsieur. Only I must tell you that it seemed\nto me he was scarcely conscious of what he was doing. Four or five times\nhe left the table, and then came back again. At last, after quite a\nstruggle, he seemed to come to some decision. He tore the letter to\npieces, and threw the pieces out of the window that opens upon the\ngarden.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite expressed herself with the utmost simplicity,\nand there was certainly nothing particularly extraordinary in her story.\nStill, those around her listened with breathless curiosity, as though\nthey were expecting some startling revelation, so much does the\nhuman mind abhor that which is natural and incline to that which is\nmysterious.\n\nWithout seeming to notice the effect she had produced, and addressing\nherself to the physician alone, the girl continued: “After the letter\nwas destroyed, M. de Chalusse seemed himself again. Coffee was served,\nand he afterward lighted a cigar as usual. However, he soon let it go\nout. I dared not disturb him by any remarks; but suddenly he said to me:\n‘It’s strange, but I feel very uncomfortable.’ A moment passed, without\neither of us speaking, and then he added: ‘I am certainly not well.\nWill you do me the favor to go to my room for me? Here is the key of my\nescritoire; open it, and on the upper shelf you will find a small bottle\nwhich please bring to me.’ I noticed with some surprise that M. de\nChalusse, who usually speaks very distinctly, stammered and hesitated\nconsiderably in making this request, but, unfortunately, I did not think\nmuch about it at the time. I did as he requested, and he poured eight\nor ten drops of the contents of the vial into a glass of water, and\nswallowed it.”\n\nSo intense was Dr. Jodon’s interest that he became himself again. He\nforgot to attitudinize. “And after that?” he asked, eagerly.\n\n“After that, M. de Chalusse seemed to feel much better, and retired to\nhis study as usual. I fancied that any annoyance the letter had caused\nhim was forgotten; but I was wrong, for in the afternoon he sent a\nmessage, through Madame Leon, requesting me to join him in the garden.\nI hastened there, very much surprised, for the weather was extremely\ndisagreeable. ‘Dear Marguerite,’ he said, on seeing me, ‘help me to find\nthe fragments of that letter which I flung from the window this morning.\nI would give half my fortune for an address which it must certainly have\ncontained, but which I quite overlooked in my anger.’ I helped him as\nhe asked. He might have reasonably hoped to succeed, for it was raining\nwhen the scraps of paper were thrown out, and instead of flying through\nthe air, they fell directly on to the ground. We succeeded in finding\na large number of the scraps, but what M. de Chalusse so particularly\nwanted was not to be read on any one of them. Several times he spoke of\nhis regret, and cursed his precipitation.”\n\nM. Bourigeau, the concierge, and M. Casimir exchanged a significant\nsmile. They had seen the count searching for the remnants of this\nletter, and had thought him little better than an idiot. But now\neverything was explained.\n\n“I was much grieved at the count’s disappointment,” continued\nMademoiselle Marguerite, “but suddenly he exclaimed, joyfully: ‘That\naddress--why, such a person will give it to me--what a fool I am!’”\n\nThe physician evinced such absorbing interest in this narrative that he\nforgot to retain his usual impassive attitude. “Such a person! Who--who\nwas this person?” he inquired eagerly, without apparently realizing the\nimpropriety of his question.\n\nBut the girl felt indignant. She silenced her indiscreet questioner\nwith a haughty glance, and in the driest possible tone, replied: “I have\nforgotten the name.”\n\nCut to the quick, the doctor suddenly resumed his master’s pose; but all\nthe same his imperturbable sang-froid was sensibly impaired. “Believe\nme, mademoiselle, that interest alone--a most respectful interest--”\n\nShe did not even seem to hear his excuse, but resumed: “I know, however,\nmonsieur, that M. de Chalusse intended applying to the police if he\nfailed to obtain this address from the person in question. After this he\nappeared to be entirely at ease. At three o’clock he rang for his valet,\nand ordered dinner two hours earlier than usual. We sat down to table\nat about half-past four. At five he rose, kissed me gayly, and left the\nhouse on foot, telling me that he was confident of success, and that he\ndid not expect to return before midnight.” The poor child’s firmness now\ngave way; her eyes filled with tears, and it was in a voice choked with\nsobs that she added, pointing to M. de Chalusse: “But at half-past six\nthey brought him back as you see him now----”\n\nAn interval of silence ensued, so deep that one could hear the faint\nbreathing of the unconscious man still lying motionless on his bed.\nHowever, the particulars of the attack were yet to be learned; and it\nwas M. Casimir whom the physician next addressed. “What did the driver\nwho brought your master home say to you?”\n\n“Oh! almost nothing, sir; not ten words.”\n\n“You must find this man and bring him to me.”\n\nTwo servants rushed out in search of him. He could not be far away, for\nhis vehicle was still standing in the courtyard. They found him in\na wine-shop near by. Some of the inquisitive spectators who had been\ndisappointed in their curiosity by Casimir’s thoughtfulness had treated\nhim to some liquor, and in exchange he had told them all he knew about\nthe affair. He had quite recovered from his fright, and was cheerful,\neven gay.\n\n“Come make haste, you are wanted,” said the servants.\n\nHe emptied his glass and followed them with very bad grace, muttering\nand swearing between his set teeth. The doctor, strange to say, was\nconsiderate enough to go out into the hall to question him; but no\ninformation of value was gained by the man’s answers. He declared that\nthe gentleman had hired him at twelve o’clock, hoping by this means\nto extort pay for five hours’ driving, which, joined to the liberal\ngratuity he could not fail to obtain, would remunerate him handsomely\nfor his day’s work. Living is dear, it should be remembered, and a\nfellow makes as much as he can.\n\nWhen the cabby had gone off, still growling, although a couple of louis\nhad been placed in his hand, the doctor returned to his patient. He\ninvoluntarily assumed his accustomed attitude, with crossed arms, a\ngloomy expression of countenance, and his forehead furrowed as if with\nthought and anxiety. But this time he was not acting a part. In spite,\nor rather by reason of, the full explanation that had been given him,\nhe found something suspicious and mysterious in the whole affair. A\nthousand vague and undefinable suspicions crossed his mind. Was he in\npresence of a crime? Certainly, evidently not. But what was the cause\nthen of the mystery and reticence he detected? Was he upon the track of\nsome lamentable family secret--one of those terrible scandals, concealed\nfor a long time, but which at last burst forth with startling effect?\nThe prospect of being mixed up in such an affair caused him infinite\npleasure. It would bring him into notice; he would be mentioned in the\npapers; and his increased practice would fill his hands with gold.\n\nBut what could he do to ingratiate himself with these people, impose\nhimself upon them if needs be? He reflected for some time, and finally\nwhat he thought an excellent plan occurred to him. He approached\nMademoiselle Marguerite, who was weeping in an arm-chair, and touched\nher gently on the shoulder. She sprang to her feet at once. “One more\nquestion, mademoiselle,” said he, imparting as much solemnity to his\ntone as he could. “Do you know what liquid it was that M. de Chalusse\ntook this morning?”\n\n“Alas! no, monsieur.”\n\n“It is very important that I should know. The accuracy of my diagnosis\nis dependent upon it. What has become of the vial?”\n\n“I think M. de Chalusse replaced it in his escritoire.”\n\nThe physician pointed to an article of furniture to the left of the\nfireplace: “There?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, monsieur.”\n\nHe deliberated, but at last conquering his hesitation, he said: “Could\nwe not obtain this vial?”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite blushed. “I haven’t the key,” she faltered, in\nevident embarrassment.\n\nM. Casimir approached: “It must be in the count’s pocket, and if\nmademoiselle will allow me----”\n\nBut she stepped back with outstretched arms as if to protect the\nescritoire. “No,” she exclaimed, “no--the escritoire shall not be\ntouched. I will not permit it----”\n\n“But, mademoiselle,” insisted the doctor, “your father----”\n\n“The Count de Chalusse is not my father!”\n\nDr. Jodon was greatly disconcerted by Mademoiselle Marguerite’s\nvehemence. “Ah!” said he, in three different tones, “ah! ah!”\n\nIn less than a second, a thousand strange and contradictory suppositions\ndarted through his brain. Who, then, could this girl be, if she were not\nMademoiselle de Chalusse? What right had she in that house? How was\nit that she reigned as a sovereign there? Above all, why this angry\noutburst for no other apparent cause than a very natural and exceedingly\ninsignificant request on his part?\n\nHowever, she had regained her self-possession, and it was easy to see\nby her manner that she was seeking some means of escape from threatened\ndanger. At last she found it. “Casimir,” she said, authoritatively,\n“search M. de Chalusse’s pocket for the key of his escritoire.”\n\nAstonished by what he regarded as a new caprice, the valet obeyed. He\ngathered up the garments strewn over the floor, and eventually drew a\nkey from one of the waistcoat pockets. Mademoiselle Marguerite took it\nfrom him, and then in a determined tone, exclaimed: “A hammer.”\n\nIt was brought; whereupon, to the profound amazement of the physician,\nshe knelt down beside the fireplace, laid the key upon one of the\nandirons, and with a heavy blow of the hammer, broke it into fragments.\n“Now,” said she, quietly, “my mind will be at rest. I am certain,” she\nadded, turning toward the servants, “that M. de Chalusse would approve\nwhat I have done. When he recovers, he will have another key made.”\n\nThe explanation was superfluous. All the servants understood the motive\nthat had influenced her, and were saying to themselves, “Mademoiselle is\nright. It would not do to touch the escritoire of a dying man. Who knows\nbut what there are millions in it? If anything were missed, why any of\nus might be accused. But if the key is destroyed, it will be impossible\nto suspect any one.”\n\nHowever, the physician’s conjectures were of an entirely different\nnature. “What can there be in that escritoire which she desires to\nconceal?” he thought.\n\nBut there was no excuse for prolonging his visit. Once more he examined\nthe sick man, whose condition remained unchanged; and then, after\nexplaining what was to be done in his absence, he declared that he must\nleave at once, as he had a number of important visits to make; he added,\nhowever, that he would return about midnight.\n\n“Madame Leon and I will watch over M. de Chalusse,” replied Mademoiselle\nMarguerite; “that is sufficient assurance, monsieur, that your orders\nwill be obeyed to the letter. Only--you will not take offence, I trust,\nif I ask the count’s regular physician to meet you in consultation.”\n\nSuch a proposal was anything but pleasing to M. Jodon, who had met with\nthe same misfortune in this aristocratic neighborhood several times\nbefore. When an accident happened, he was summoned because he chanced\nto be close at hand, but just as he was flattering himself that he\nhad gained a desirable patient, he found himself in presence of some\ncelebrated physician, who had come from a distance in his carriage.\nAccustomed to such disappointments, he knew how to conceal his\ndissatisfaction.\n\n“Were I in your place, mademoiselle, I should do precisely what you\nsuggest,” he answered, “and should you think it unnecessary for me to\ncall, I----”\n\n“Oh! monsieur, on the contrary, I shall certainly expect you.”\n\n“In that case, very well.” Thereupon he bowed and left the room.\n\nBut Mademoiselle Marguerite followed him on to the landing. “You know,\nmonsieur,” she said, speaking rapidly in an undertone, “that I am not\nM. de Chalusse’s daughter. You may, therefore, tell me the truth. Is his\ncondition hopeless?”\n\n“Alarming--yes; hopeless--no.”\n\n“But, monsieur, this terrible unconsciousness----”\n\n“It usually follows such an attack as he has been the victim of. Still\nwe may hope that the paralysis will gradually disappear, and the power\nof motion return after a time.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite was listening, pale, agitated, and embarrassed.\nIt was evident that she had a question on her lips which she scarcely\ndared to ask. At last, however, summoning all her courage, she\nexclaimed: “And if M. de Chalusse should not recover, will he die\nwithout regaining consciousness--without being able to speak?”\n\n“I am unable to say, mademoiselle--the count’s malady is one of those\nwhich set at naught all the hypotheses of science.”\n\nShe thanked him sadly, sent a servant to summon Madame Leon, and\nreturned to the count’s room.\n\nAs for the doctor, he said to himself as he went downstairs, “What a\nstrange girl! Is she afraid that the count will regain consciousness?\nor, on the contrary, does she wish him to speak? Is there any question\nof a will under all this? What else can it be? What is at stake?” His\npreoccupation was so intense that he almost forgot where he was going,\nand he paused on every step. It was not until the fresh air of the\ncourtyard blew upon his face, reminding him of the realities of life,\nthat the charlatanesque element in his nature regained the ascendency.\n“My friend,” he said, addressing M. Casimir, who was lighting him out,\n“you must at once have some straw spread over the street so as to deaden\nthe sound of the vehicles. And to-morrow, you must inform the commissary\nof police.”\n\nTen minutes later a thick bed of straw had been strewed across the\nthoroughfare, and the drivers of passing vehicles involuntarily\nslackened their speed, for every one in Paris knows what this signifies.\nM. Casimir personally superintended the work which was intrusted to the\ngrooms, and he was about to return indoors again, when a young man, who\nhad been walking up and down in front of the mansion for more than an\nhour, hastily approached him. He was a beardless fellow with a strangely\nwrinkled face, as leaden-tinted as that of a confirmed absinthe-drinker.\nHis general expression was shrewd, and at the same time impudent, and\nsurprising audacity gleamed in his eyes. “What do you want?” asked M.\nCasimir.\n\nThe young fellow bowed humbly, and replied, “Ah, don’t you recognize\nme, monsieur? I’m Toto--excuse me--Victor Chupin, employed by M. Isidore\nFortunat.”\n\n“Oh, yes. I recollect.”\n\n“I came, in obedience to my employer’s orders, to inquire if you had\nobtained the information you promised him; but seeing that something had\nhappened at your house, I didn’t dare go in, but decided to watch for\nyou----”\n\n“And you did quite right, my lad. I have no information to give you--ah,\nyes! stop! The Marquis de Valorsay was closeted with the count for two\nhours yesterday. But what good will that do? The count has been taken\nsuddenly ill, and he will scarcely live through the night.”\n\nVictor Chupin was thunderstruck. “Impossible!” he cried. “Is it for him\nthat the straw has been strewed in the street?”\n\n“It’s for him.”\n\n“What a lucky fellow! No one would go to such expense for me! But I have\nan idea that my guv’nor will hardly laugh when I tell him this. Still,\nthank you all the same, m’sieur, and au revoir.” He was darting off when\na sudden thought detained him. “Excuse me,” said he, with conjuror\nlike volubility; “I was so horrified that I forgot business. Tell\nme, m’sieur, if the count dies, you’ll take charge of the funeral\narrangements, won’t you? Very well; a word of advice then. Don’t go to\nthe regular undertakers, but come to me: here’s my address”--proffering\na card--“I will treat with the undertakers for you, and take charge of\neverything. It will be much better and far cheaper for you, on account\nof certain arrangements I’ve made with these parties. Everything, to the\nvery last plume, is warranted to give perfect satisfaction. Each item\nwill be specified in the bill, and can be verified during the ceremony,\nno payment exacted until after delivery. Well, is it understood?”\n\nThe valet shrugged his shoulders. “Nonsense!” said he, carelessly; “what\nis all that to me?”\n\n“Ah! I forgot to mention that there would be a commission of two hundred\nfrancs to divide between us.”\n\n“That’s consideration. Give me your card, and rely on me. My compliments\nto M. Fortunat, please.” And so saying, he re-entered the house.\n\nVictor Chupin drew a huge silver watch from his pocket and consulted\nit. “Five minutes to eight,” he growled, “and the guv’nor expects me at\neight precisely. I shall have to stretch out my legs.”\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nM. Isidore Fortunat resided at No. 27 Place de la Bourse, on the\nthird floor. He had a handsome suite of apartments: a drawing-room, a\ndining-room, a bed-room, a large outer office where his clerks\nworked, and a private one, which was the sanctuary of his thoughts and\nmeditations. The whole cost him only six thousand francs a year, a mere\ntrifle as rents go nowadays. His lease entitled him, moreover, to the\nuse of a room ten feet square, up under the eaves, where he lodged his\nservant, Madame Dodelin, a woman of forty-six or thereabouts, who had\nmet with reverses of fortune, and who now took such good charge of his\nestablishment, that his table--for he ate at home--was truly fit for a\nsybarite.\n\nHaving been established here for five years or more, M. Fortunat was\nvery well known in the neighborhood, and, as he paid his rent promptly,\nand met all his obligations without demur, he was generally respected.\nBesides, people knew very well from what source M. Fortunat derived his\nincome. He gave his attention to contested claims, liquidations, the\nrecovery of legacies, and so on, as was shown by the inscription in\nlarge letters which figured on the elegant brass plate adorning his\ndoor. He must have had a prosperous business, for he employed six\ncollectors in addition to the clerks who wrote all day long in his\noffice; and his clients were so numerous that the concierge was often\nheard to complain of the way they ran up and down the stairs, declaring\nthat it was worse than a procession.\n\nTo be just, we must add that M. Fortunat’s appearance, manners\nand conduct were of a nature to quiet all suspicions. He was some\nthirty-eight years of age, extremely methodical in his habits, gentle\nand refined in his manner, intelligent, very good-looking, and always\ndressed in perfect taste. He was accused of being, in business matters,\nas cold, as polished, and as hard as one of the marble slabs of the\nMorgue; but then, no one was obliged to employ him unless they chose\nto do so. This much is certain: he did not frequent cafes or places of\namusement. If he went out at all after dinner, it was only to pass\nthe evening at the house of some rich client in the neighborhood. He\ndetested the smell of tobacco, and was inclined to be devout--never\nfailing to attend eight o’clock mass on Sunday mornings. His housekeeper\nsuspected him of matrimonial designs, and perhaps she was right.\n\nOn the evening that the Count de Chalusse was struck with apoplexy M.\nIsidore Fortunat had been dining alone and was sipping a cup of tea when\nthe door-bell rang, announcing the arrival of a visitor. Madame Dodelin\nhastened to open the door, and in walked Victor Chupin, breathless from\nhis hurried walk. It had not taken him twenty-five minutes to cover\nthe distance which separates the Rue de Courcelles from the Place de la\nBourse.\n\n“You are late, Victor,” said M. Fortunat, quietly.\n\n“That’s true, monsieur, but it isn’t my fault. Everything was in\nconfusion down there, and I was obliged to wait.”\n\n“How is that? Why?”\n\n“The Count de Chalusse was stricken with apoplexy this evening, and he\nis probably dead by this time.”\n\nM. Fortunat sprang from his chair with a livid face and trembling lips.\n“Stricken with apoplexy!” he exclaimed in a husky voice. “I am ruined!”\n\nThen, fearing Madame Dodelin’s curiosity, he seized the lamp and rushed\ninto his office, crying to Chupin: “Follow me.”\n\nChupin obeyed without a word, for he was a shrewd fellow, and knew how\nto make the best of a trying situation. He was not usually allowed\nto enter this private room, the floor of which was covered with a\nmagnificent carpet; and so, after carefully closing the door, he\nremained standing, hat in hand, and looking somewhat intimidated. But\nM. Fortunat seemed to have forgotten his presence. After depositing the\nlamp on the mantel-shelf, he walked several times round and round the\nroom like a hunted beast seeking for some means of egress.\n\n“If the count is dead,” he muttered, “the Marquis de Valorsay is lost!\nFarewell to the millions!”\n\nThe blow was so cruel, and so entirely unexpected, that he could not,\nwould not believe in its reality. He walked straight to Chupin, and\ncaught him by the collar, as if the young fellow had been the cause\nof this misfortune. “It isn’t possible,” said he; “the count CANNOT\nbe dead. You are deceiving me, or they deceived you. You must have\nmisunderstood--you only wished to give some excuse for your delay\nperhaps. Speak, say something!”\n\nAs a rule, Chupin was not easily impressed, but he felt almost\nfrightened by his employer’s agitation. “I only repeated what M. Casimir\ntold me, monsieur,” was his reply.\n\nHe then wished to furnish some particulars, but M. Fortunat had already\nresumed his furious tramp to and fro, giving vent to his wrath and\ndespair in incoherent exclamations. “Forty thousand francs lost!” he\nexclaimed. “Forty thousand francs, counted out there on my desk! I see\nthem yet, counted and placed in the hand of the Marquis de Valorsay in\nexchange for his signature. My savings for a number of years, and I have\nonly a worthless scrap of paper to show for them. That cursed marquis!\nAnd he was to come here this evening, and I was to give him ten thousand\nfrancs more. They are lying there in that drawer. Let him come, the\nwretch, let him come!”\n\nAnger had positively brought foam to M. Fortunat’s lips, and any one\nseeing him then would subsequently have had but little confidence in his\ncustomary good-natured air and unctuous politeness. “And yet the marquis\nis as much to be pitied as I am,” he continued. “He loses as much,\neven more! And such a sure thing it seemed, too! What speculation can a\nfellow engage in after this? And a man must put his money somewhere; he\ncan’t bury it in the ground!”\n\nChupin listened with an air of profound commiseration; but it was only\nassumed. He was inwardly jubilant, for his interest in the affair was in\ndirect opposition to that of his employer. Indeed, if M. Fortunat lost\nforty thousand francs by the Count de Chalusse’s death, Chupin expected\nto make a hundred francs commission on the funeral.\n\n“Still, he may have made a will!” pursued M. Fortunat. “But no, I’m\nsure he hasn’t. A poor devil who has only a few sous to leave behind him\nalways takes this precaution. He thinks he may be run over by an omnibus\nand suddenly killed, and he always writes and signs his last wishes.\nBut millionaires don’t think of such things; they believe themselves\nimmortal!” He paused to reflect for a moment, for power of reflection\nhad returned to him. His excitement had quickly spent itself by reason\nof its very violence. “This much is certain,” he resumed, slowly, and\nin a more composed voice, “whether the count has made a will or not,\nValorsay will lose the millions he expected from Chalusse. If there\nis no will, Mademoiselle Marguerite won’t have a sou, and then, good\nevening! If there is one, this devil of a girl, suddenly becoming\nher own mistress, and wealthy into the bargain, will send Monsieur de\nValorsay about his business, especially if she loves another, as he\nhimself admits--and in that case, again good evening!”\n\nM. Fortunat drew out his handkerchief, and, pausing in front of the\nlooking-glass, wiped the perspiration from his brow, and arranged his\ndisordered hair. He was one of those men who may be stunned, but never\ncrushed, by a catastrophe. “In conclusion,” he muttered, “I must enter\nmy forty thousand francs as an item in the profit and loss account. It\nonly remains to be seen if it would not be possible to regain them in\nthe same affair.” He was again master of himself, and never had his mind\nbeen more clear. He seated himself at his desk, leant his elbows upon\nit, rested his head on his hands, and remained for some time perfectly\nmotionless; but there was triumph in his gesture when he at last looked\nup again.\n\n“I am safe,” he muttered, so low that Chupin could not hear him. “What a\nfool I was! If there is no will a fourth of the millions shall be mine!\nAh, when a man knows his ground, he never need lose the battle! But I\nmust act quickly,” he added, “very quickly.” And so speaking, he rose\nand glanced at the clock. “Nine o’clock,” said he. “I must open the\ncampaign this very evening.”\n\nMotionless in his dark corner, Chupin still retained his commiserating\nattitude; but he was so oppressed with curiosity that he could scarcely\nbreathe. He opened his eyes and ears to the utmost, and watched his\nemployer’s slightest movements with intense interest.\n\nPrompt to act when he had once decided upon his course, M. Fortunat now\ndrew from his desk a large portfolio, crammed full of letters, receipts,\nbills, deeds of property, and old parchments. “I can certainly discover\nthe necessary pretext here,” he murmured, rummaging through the mass of\npapers. But he did not at once find what he sought, and he was growing\nimpatient, as could be seen by his feverish haste, when all at once he\npaused with a sigh of relief. “At last!”\n\nHe held in his hand a soiled and crumpled note of hand, affixed by a\npin to a huissier’s protest, thus proving conclusively that it had been\ndishonored. M. Fortunat waved these strips of paper triumphantly, and\nwith a satisfied air exclaimed: “It is here that I must strike; it is\nhere--if Casimir hasn’t deceived me--that I shall find the indispensable\ninformation I need.”\n\nHe was in such haste that he did not wait to put his portfolio in order.\nHe threw it with the papers it had contained into the drawer of his\ndesk again, and, approaching Chupin, he asked, “It was you, was it not,\nVictor, who obtained that information respecting the solvency of the\nVantrassons, husband and wife, who let out furnished rooms?”\n\n“Yes, monsieur, and I gave you the answer: nothing to hope for----”\n\n“I know; but that doesn’t matter. Do you remember their address?”\n\n“Perfectly. They are now living on the Asnieres Road, beyond the\nfortifications, on the right hand side.”\n\n“What is the number?”\n\nChupin hesitated, reflected for a moment, and then began to scratch\nhis head furiously, as he was in the habit of doing whenever his memory\nfailed him and he wished to recall it to duty. “I’m not sure whether the\nnumber is eighteen or forty-six,” he said, at last; “that is----”\n\n“Never mind,” interrupted M. Fortunat. “If I sent you to the house could\nyou find it?”\n\n“Oh--yes, m’sieur--at once--with my eyes shut. I can see the place\nperfectly--a rickety old barrack. There is a tract of unoccupied land on\none side, and a kitchen-garden in the rear.”\n\n“Very well; you shall accompany me there.”\n\nChupin seemed astonished by this strange proposal. “What, m’sieur,” said\nhe, “do you think of going there at this time of night?”\n\n“Why not? Shall we find the establishment closed?”\n\n“No; certainly not. Vantrasson doesn’t merely keep furnished rooms; he’s\na grocer, and sells liquor too. His place is open until eleven o’clock\nat least. But if you are going there to present a bill, it’s perhaps\na little late. If I were in your place, m’sieur, I should wait\ntill to-morrow. It’s raining, and the streets are deserted. It’s an\nout-of-the-way place too; and in such cases, a man has been known to\nsettle his account with whatever came handiest--with a cudgel, or a\nbullet, for instance.”\n\n“Are you afraid?”\n\nThis question seemed so utterly absurd to Chupin that he was not in\nthe least offended by it; his only answer was a disdainful shrug of the\nshoulders.\n\n“Then we will go,” remarked M. Fortunat. “While I’m getting ready, go\nand hire a cab, and see that you get a good horse.”\n\nChupin was off in an instant, tearing down the staircase like a tempest.\nThere was a cab-stand only a few steps from the house, but he preferred\nto run to the jobmaster’s stables in the Rue Feydeau.\n\n“Cab, sir!” shouted several men, as they saw him approaching.\n\nHe made no reply, but began to examine the horses with the air of a\nconnoisseur, until at last he found an animal that suited him. Thereupon\nhe beckoned to the driver, and going to the little office where a woman\nsat reading: “My five sous, if you please,” he said, authoritatively.\n\nThe woman looked at him. Most jobmasters are in the habit of giving five\nsous to any servant who comes in search of a cab for his master; and\nthis was the custom here. But the keeper of the office, who felt sure\nthat Chupin was not a servant, hesitated; and this made the young fellow\nangry. “Make haste,” he cried, imperiously. “If you don’t, I shall run\nto the nearest stand.”\n\nThe woman at once threw him five sous, which he pocketed with a\nsatisfied grin. They were his--rightfully his--since he had taken the\ntrouble to gain them. He then hastily returned to the office to inform\nhis employer that the cab was waiting at the door, and found himself\nface to face with a sight which made him open his eyes to their widest\nextent.\n\nM. Fortunat had profited by his clerk’s absence, not to disguise\nhimself--that would be saying too much--but to make some changes in his\nappearance. He had arrayed himself in a long overcoat, shiny with grease\nand wear, and falling below his knees; in place of his elegant satin\ncravat he had knotted a gaudy silk neckerchief about his throat; his\nboots were worn, and out of shape; and his hat would have been treated\nwith contempt even by a dealer in old clothes. Of the prosperous\nFortunat, so favorably known round about the Place de la Bourse, naught\nremained save his face and his hands. Another Fortunat had taken his\nplace, more than needy in aspect--wretched, famished, gaunt with hunger,\nready for any desperate deed. And, yet, he seemed at ease in this garb;\nit yielded to his every movement, as if he had worn it for a long time.\nThe butterfly had become a chrysalis again. Chupin’s admiring smile must\nhave repaid him for his trouble. Since the young clerk evinced approval,\nM. Fortunat felt sure that Vantrasson would take him for what he wished\nto appear--a poor devil of an agent, who was acting on some other\nperson’s behalf. “Let us start at once,” said he.\n\nBut just as he was leaving the ante-room, he remembered an order of\ngreat importance which he wished to give. He called Madame Dodelin, and\nwithout paying the slightest heed to her astonishment at seeing him thus\nattired: “If the Marquis de Valorsay comes, in my absence,” said\nhe--“and he WILL come--ask him to wait for me. I shall return\nbefore midnight. Don’t take him into my office--he can wait in the\ndrawing-room.”\n\nThis last order was certainly unnecessary, since M. Fortunat had closed\nand double-locked his office door and placed the key carefully in his\nown pocket. But perhaps he had forgotten this circumstance. There\nwere now no traces of his recent anger and disappointment. He was in\nexcellent humor; and you might have supposed that he was starting on an\nenterprise from which he expected to derive both pleasure and profit.\n\nChupin was climbing to a place on the box beside the driver when his\nemployer bade him take a seat inside the vehicle. They were not long in\nreaching their destination, for the horse was really a good one, and the\ndriver had been stimulated by the promise of a magnificent gratuity. In\nfact, M. Fortunat and his companion reached the Asnieres Road in less\nthan forty minutes.\n\nIn obedience to the orders he had received before starting, the cabman\ndrew up on the right hand side of the road, at about a hundred paces\nfrom the city gate, beyond the fortifications. “Well, sir, here you are!\nAre you satisfied?” he inquired, as he opened the door.\n\n“Perfectly satisfied,” replied M. Fortunat. “Here is your promised\ngratuity. Now, you have only to wait for us. Don’t stir from this place.\nDo you understand?”\n\nBut the driver shook his head. “Excuse me,” he said, “but if it’s all\nthe same to you, I will station myself over there near the gate. Here,\nyou see, I should be afraid to go to sleep, while over there----”\n\n“Very well; suit yourself,” M. Fortunat replied.\n\nThis precaution on the driver’s part convinced him that Chupin had not\nexaggerated the evil reputation of this quarter of the Parisian suburbs.\nAnd, indeed, there was little of a reassuring character in the aspect\nof this broad road, quite deserted at this hour, and shrouded in the\ndarkness of a tempestuous night. The rain had ceased falling, but the\nwind blew with increased violence, twisting the branches off the trees,\ntearing slates from the roofs, and shaking the street-lamps so furiously\nas to extinguish the gas. They could not see a step before them; the mud\nwas ankle-deep, and not a person, not a solitary soul was visible.\n\n“Are we almost there?” M. Fortunat asked every ten paces.\n\n“Almost there, m’sieur.”\n\nChupin said this; but to tell the truth, he knew nothing about it.\nHe tried to discover where he was, but did not succeed. Houses were\nbecoming scanty, and vacant plots of building ground more numerous;\nit was only with the greatest difficulty that one could occasionally\ndiscern a light. At last, however, after a quarter of an hour’s hard\nstruggling, Chupin uttered a joyful cry. “Here we are, m’sieur--look!”\n said he.\n\nA large building, five stories high, sinister of aspect, and standing\nquite alone, could just be distinguished in the darkness. It was already\nfalling to pieces, and yet it was not entirely completed. Plainly\nenough, the speculator who had undertaken the enterprise had not been\nrich enough to complete it. On seeing the many closely pierced windows\nof the facade, a passer-by could not fail to divine for what purpose\nthe building had been erected; and in order that no one should remain in\nignorance of it, this inscription: “Furnished Rooms,” figured in\nletters three feet high, between the third and fourth floors. The inside\narrangements could be easily divined: innumerable rooms, all small and\ninconvenient, and let out at exorbitant rentals.\n\nHowever, Victor Chupin’s memory had misled him. This establishment was\nnot on the right, but on the left-hand side of the road, a perfect mire\nthrough which M. Fortunat and his companion were obliged to cross. Their\neyes having become accustomed to the darkness, they could discern sundry\ndetails as they approached the building. The ground floor comprised\ntwo shops, one of which was closed, but the other was still open, and a\nfaint light gleamed through the soiled red curtains. Over the frontage\nappeared the shop-keeper’s name, Vantrasson, while on either side, in\nsmaller letters, were the words: “Groceries and Provisions--Foreign and\nFrench Wines.” Everything about this den denoted abject poverty and low\ndebauchery.\n\nM. Fortunat certainly did not recoil, but before entering the shop\nhe was not sorry to have an opportunity to reconnoitre. He approached\ncautiously, and peered through the window at a place where a rent in\nthe curtain allowed him some view of the interior. Behind the counter\na woman who looked some fifty years of age was seated, mending a soiled\ndress by the light of a smoking lamp. She was short and very stout.\nShe seemed literally weighed down, and puffed out by an unwholesome\nand unnatural mass of superfluous flesh; and she was as white as if her\nveins had been filled with water, instead of blood. Her hanging\ncheeks, her receding forehead, and her thin lips, imparted an alarming\nexpression of wickedness and cunning to her countenance. At the farther\nend of the store Fortunat could vaguely discern the figure of a man\nseated on a stool. He seemed to be asleep, for his crossed arms rested\non a table, with his head leaning on them.\n\n“Good luck!” whispered Chupin in his employer’s ear; “there is not\na customer in the place. Vantrasson and his wife are alone.” This\ncircumstance was by no means displeasing to M. Fortunat, as could be\nseen by his expression of face. “So, m’sieur,” continued Chupin, “you\nneed have no fears. I’ll remain here and watch, while you go in.”\n\nM. Fortunat did so. On hearing the door open and shut, the woman laid\ndown her work. “What can I do for monsieur?” she asked, in a wheedling\nvoice.\n\nM. Fortunat did not reply at once; but he drew the note with which\nhe had provided himself from his pocket, and displayed it. “I am a\nhuissier’s clerk,” he then exclaimed; “and I called in reference to this\nlittle matter--a note of hand for five hundred and eighty-three francs,\nvalue received in goods, signed Vantrasson, and made payable to the\norder of a person named Barutin.”\n\n“An execution!” said the woman, whose voice suddenly soured.\n“Vantrasson, wake up, and come and see about this.”\n\nThis summons was unnecessary. On hearing the words “note of hand,”\n the man had lifted his head; and at the name of Barutin, he rose and\napproached with a heavy, uncertain step, as if he had not yet slept\noff his intoxication. He was younger than his wife, tall, with a\nwell-proportioned and athletic form. His features were regular, but the\nabuse of alcohol and all sorts of excesses had greatly marred them, and\ntheir present expression was one of ferocious brutishness. “What’s that\nyou are talking about?” he asked in a harsh, grating voice. “Is it to\nmock people that you come and ask for money on the 15th of October--rent\nday? Where have you seen any money left after the landlord has made his\nround? Besides, what is this bill? Give it me to look at.”\n\nM. Fortunat was not guilty of such folly; he did not intrust the paper\nto Vantrasson’s hand, but held it a little distance from him, and then\nread it aloud.\n\nWhen he had finished: “That note fell due eighteen months ago,” declared\nVantrasson. “It is worth nothing now.”\n\n“You are mistaken--a note of this kind is of value any time within five\nyears after the day it goes to protest.”\n\n“Possibly; but as Barutin has failed, and gone no one knows where, I am\nreleased----”\n\n“Another mistake on your part. You owe these five hundred and\neighty-three francs to the person who bought this note at Barutin’s\nsale, and who has given my employer orders to prosecute----”\n\nThe blood had risen to Vantrasson’s face. “And what of that? Do you\nsuppose I’ve never been sued for debts before? Even the king can’t take\nanything from a person who possesses nothing; and I own nothing. My\nfurniture is all pawned or mortgaged, and my stock is not worth a\nhundred francs. When your employer finds it useless to waste money in\nworrying me, he’ll let me alone. You can’t injure a man like me.”\n\n“Do you really think so?”\n\n“I’m sure of it.”\n\n“Unfortunately you are again mistaken, for although the holder of the\nnote doesn’t care so very much about obtaining his dues, he’ll spend his\nown money like water to make trouble for you.” And thereupon M. Fortunat\nbegan to draw a vivid and frightful picture of a poor debtor pursued\nby a rich creditor who harassed him, and tortured him, and hounded him\neverywhere, until not even a change of clothing was left him.\n\nVantrasson rolled his eyes and brandished his formidable fist in the\nmost defiant manner; but his wife was evidently much alarmed. At last\nshe could bear it no longer, and rising hastily she led her husband to\nthe rear of the shop, saying: “Come, I must speak with you.”\n\nHe followed her, and they remained for some little time conversing\ntogether in a low tone, but with excited gestures. When they returned,\nthe woman opened the conversation. “Alas! sir,” she said to M. Fortunat,\n“we have no money just now; business is so very bad, and if you\nprosecute us, we are lost. What can be done? You look like an honest\nman; give us your advice.”\n\nM. Fortunat did not reply at once; he was apparently absorbed in\nthought, but suddenly he exclaimed: “One owes a duty to unfortunate\nfolks, and I’m going to tell you the exact truth. My employer, who isn’t\na bad man at heart, hasn’t the slightest desire for revenge. He said to\nme: ‘Go and see these Vantrassons, and if they seem to be worthy people,\npropose a compromise. If they choose to accept it, I shall be quite\nsatisfied.’”\n\n“And what is this compromise?”\n\n“It is this: you must write an acknowledgment of the debt on a sheet of\nstamped paper, together with a promise to pay a little on account each\nmonth. In exchange I will give you this note of hand.”\n\nThe husband and wife exchanged glances, and it was the woman who said:\n“We accept.”\n\nBut to carry out this arrangement it was necessary to have a sheet of\nstamped paper, and the spurious clerk had neglected to provide himself\nwith some. This circumstance seemed to annoy him greatly, and you might\nalmost have sworn that he regretted the concession he had promised. Did\nhe think of going? Madame Vantrasson feared so, and turning eagerly\nto her husband, she exclaimed: “Run to the tobacco shop in the Rue de\nLevis; you will find some paper there!”\n\nHe started off at once, and M. Fortunat breathed freely again. He had\ncertainly retained his composure admirably during the interview, but\nmore than once he had fancied that Vantrasson was about to spring on\nhim, crush him with his brawny hands, tear the note from him, burn it,\nand then throw him, Fortunat, out into the street, helpless and nearly\ndead. But now that danger had passed and Madame Vantrasson, fearing he\nmight tire of waiting, was prodigal in her attentions. She brought\nhim the only unbroken chair in the establishment, and insisted that he\nshould partake of some refreshment--a glass of wine at the very least.\nWhile rummaging among the bottles, she alternately thanked him and\ncomplained, declaring she had a right to repine, since she had known\nbetter days--but fate had been against her ever since her marriage,\nthough she had little thought she would end her days in such misery,\nafter having been so happy in the Count de Chalusse’s household many\nyears before.\n\nTo all appearance, M. Fortunat listened with the mere superficial\ninterest which ordinary politeness requires one to show, but in reality\nhis heart was filled with intense delight. Coming here without any\nclearly-defined plan, circumstances had served him a thousand times\nbetter than he could reasonably have hoped. He had preserved his\npower over the Vantrassons, had won their confidence, had succeeded\nin obtaining a tete-a-tete with the wife, and to crown all, this woman\nalluded, of her own accord, to the very subject upon which he was\nlonging to question her.\n\n“Ah! if I were only back in the Count’s household again,” she exclaimed.\n“Six hundred francs a year, and gifts worth double that amount. Those\nwere good times for me. But you know how it is--one is never content\nwith one’s lot, and then the heart is weak----”\n\nShe had not succeeded in finding the sweet wine which she proposed to\nher guest; so in its place she substituted a mixture of ratafia and\nbrandy in two large glasses which she placed upon the counter. “One\nevening, to my sorrow,” she resumed, “I met Vantrasson at a ball. It was\nthe 13th day of the month. I might have known no good would come of it.\nAh, you should have seen him at that time, in full uniform. He belonged\nto the Paris Guards then. All the women were crazy about soldiers, and\nmy head was turned, too----” Her tone, her gestures, and the compression\nof her thin lips, revealed the bitterness of her disappointment and her\nunavailing regret. “Ah, these handsome men!” she continued; “don’t\ntalk to me about them! This one had heard of my savings. I had nineteen\nthousand francs, so he begged me to marry him, and I was fool enough\nto consent. Yes, fool--for I was forty, and he was only thirty. I might\nhave known it was my money that he wanted, and not me. However, I gave\nup my situation, and even purchased a substitute for him, in order that\nI might have him all to myself.”\n\nShe had gradually warmed with her theme, as she described her confidence\nand blind credulity, and then, with a tragic gesture, as if she desired\nto drive away these cruel memories, she suddenly seized her glass and\nemptied it at a draught.\n\nChupin, who was still at his post outside, experienced a thrill of\nenvy, and involuntarily licked his lips. “A mixed ratafia,” he said,\nlongingly. “I shouldn’t object to one myself.”\n\nHowever, this choice compound seemed to inspire Madame Vantrasson with\nrenewed energy, for, with still greater earnestness, she resumed: “At\nfirst, all went well. We employed my savings in purchasing the Hotel des\nEspagnes, in the Rue Notre Dame des Victoires, and business prospered;\nthere was never a vacant room. But any person who has drank, sir, will\ndrink again. Vantrasson kept sober for a few months, but gradually he\nfell into his old habits. He was in such a condition most of the time\nthat he was scarcely able to ask for food. And if that had been all!\nBut, unfortunately, he was too handsome a man to be a good husband. One\nnight he didn’t come home, and the next day, when I ventured to reproach\nhim--very gently, I assure you--he answered me with an oath and a blow.\nAll our happiness was over! Monsieur declared that he was master, and\nwould do as he liked. He drank and carried away all the wine from the\ncellar--he took all the money--he remained away for weeks together; and\nif I complained--more blows!”\n\nHer voice trembled, and a tear gathered in her eye; but, wiping it away\nwith the back of her hand, she resumed: “Vantrasson was always drunk,\nand I spent my time in crying my very eyes out. Business became very\nbad, and soon everybody left the house. We were obliged to sell it.\nWe did so, and bought a small cafe. But by the end of the year we lost\nthat. Fortunately, I still had a little money left, and so I bought a\nstock of groceries in my own name; but in less than six months the stock\nwas eaten up, and we were cast into the street. What was to be done?\nVantrasson drank worse than ever; he demanded money when he knew that I\nhad none to give him, and he treated me even more cruelly than before.\nI lost courage--and yet one must live! Oh, you wouldn’t believe it if\nI told you how we have lived for the past four years.” She did not tell\nhim, but contented herself with adding, “When you begin to go down hill,\nthere is no such thing as stopping; you roll lower and lower, until you\nreach the bottom, as we have done. Here we live, no one knows how; we\nhave to pay our rent each week, and if we are driven from this place, I\nsee no refuge but the river.”\n\n“If I had been in your position, I should have left my husband,” M.\nFortunat ventured to remark.\n\n“Yes--it would have been better, no doubt. People advised me to do\nso, and I tried. Three or four times I went away, and yet I always\nreturned--it was stronger than myself. Besides, I’m his wife; I’ve paid\ndearly for him; he’s mine--I won’t yield him to any one else. He beats\nme, no doubt; I despise him, I hate him, and yet I----” She poured out\npart of a glass of brandy, and swallowed it; then, with a gesture of\nrage, she added: “I can’t give him up! It’s fate! As it is now, it will\nbe until the end, until he starves, or I----”\n\nM. Fortunat’s countenance wore an expression of profound commiseration.\nA looker-on would have supposed him interested and sympathetic to the\nlast degree; but in reality, he was furious. Time was passing, and the\nconversation was wandering farther and farther from the object of his\nvisit. “I am surprised, madame,” said he, “that you never applied to\nyour former employer, the Count de Chalusse.”\n\n“Alas! I did apply to him for assistance several times----”\n\n“With what result?”\n\n“The first time I went to him he received me; I told him my troubles,\nand he gave me bank-notes to the amount of five thousand francs.”\n\nM. Fortunat raised his hands to the ceiling. “Five thousand francs!” he\nrepeated, in a tone of astonishment; “this count must be very rich----”\n\n“So rich, monsieur, that he doesn’t know how much he’s worth. He owns,\nnobody knows how many houses in Paris, chateaux in every part of the\ncountry, entire villages, forests--his gold comes in by the shovelful.”\n\nThe spurious clerk closed his eyes, as if he were dazzled by this vision\nof wealth.\n\n“The second time I went to the count’s house,” resumed Madame\nVantrasson, “I didn’t see him, but he sent me a thousand francs. The\nthird and last time they gave me twenty francs at the door, and told me\nthat the count had gone on a journey. I understood that I could hope for\nno further help from him. Besides, all the servants had been changed.\nOne morning, without any apparent reason, M. de Chalusse dismissed all\nthe old servants, so they told me. He even sent away the concierge and\nthe housekeeper.”\n\n“Why didn’t you apply to his wife?”\n\n“M. de Chalusse isn’t married. He never has been married.”\n\nFrom the expression of solicitude upon her guest’s features, Madame\nVantrasson supposed he was racking his brain to discover some mode of\nescape from her present difficulties. “If I were in your place,” he\nsaid, “I should try to interest his relatives and family in my case----”\n\n“The count has no relatives.”\n\n“Impossible!”\n\n“He hasn’t, indeed. During the ten years I was in his service, I heard\nhim say more than a dozen times that he alone was left of all his\nfamily--that all the others were dead. People pretend that this is the\nreason why he is so immensely rich.”\n\nM. Fortunat’s interest was no longer assumed; he was rapidly approaching\nthe real object of his visit. “No relatives!” he muttered. “Who, then,\nwill inherit his millions when he dies?”\n\nMadame Vantrasson jerked her head. “Who can say?” she replied.\n“Everything will go to the government, probably, unless---- But no,\nthat’s impossible.”\n\n“What’s impossible?”\n\n“Nothing. I was thinking of the count’s sister, Mademoiselle Hermine.”\n\n“His sister! Why, you said just now that he had no relatives.”\n\n“It’s the same as if he hadn’t; no one knows what has become of her,\npoor creature! Some say that she married; others declare that she died.\nIt’s quite a romance.”\n\nM. Isidore Fortunat was literally upon the rack; and to make his\nsufferings still more horrible, he dared not ask any direct question,\nnor allow his curiosity to become manifest, for fear of alarming the\nwoman. “Let me see,” said he; “I think--I am sure that I have heard--or\nthat I have read--I cannot say which--some story about a Mademoiselle de\nChalusse. It was something terrible, wasn’t it?”\n\n“Terrible, indeed. But what I was speaking of happened a long time\nago--twenty-five or twenty-six years ago, at the very least. I was still\nin my own part of the country--at Besancon. No one knows the exact truth\nabout the affair.”\n\n“What! not even you?”\n\n“Oh! I--that’s an entirely different thing. When I entered the count’s\nservice, six years later, there was still an old gardener who knew the\nwhole story, and who told it to me, making me swear that I would never\nbetray his confidence.”\n\nLavish of details as she had been in telling her own story, it was\nevident that she was determined to exercise a prudent reserve in\neverything connected with the De Chalusse family; and M. Fortunat\ninwardly cursed this, to him, most unseasonable discretion. But he was\nexperienced in these examinations, and he had at his command little\ntricks for loosening tongues, which even an investigating magistrate\nmight have envied. Without seeming to attach the slightest importance to\nMadame Vantrasson’s narrative, he rose with a startled air, like a\nman who suddenly realizes that he has forgotten himself. “Zounds!” he\nexclaimed, “we sit here gossiping, and it’s growing late. I really can’t\nwait for your husband. If I remain here any longer, I shall miss the\nlast omnibus; and I live on the other side of the river, near the\nLuxembourg.”\n\n“But our agreement, monsieur?”\n\n“We will draw that up at some future time. I shall be passing again, or\nI will send one of my colleagues to see you.”\n\nIt was Madame Vantrasson’s turn to tremble now. She feared, if she\nallowed this supposed clerk to go without signing the agreement, that\nthe person who came in his stead might not prove so accommodating; and\neven if he called again himself, he might not be so kindly disposed.\n“Wait just a moment longer, monsieur,” she pleaded; “my husband will\nsoon be back, and the last omnibus doesn’t leave the Rue de Levis until\nmidnight.”\n\n“I wouldn’t refuse, but this part of the suburbs is so lonely.”\n\n“Vantrasson will see you on your way.” And, resolved to detain him at\nany cost, she poured out a fresh glass of liquor for him, and said:\n“Where were we? Oh, yes! I was about to tell you Mademoiselle Hermine’s\nstory.”\n\nConcealing his delight with an assumed air of resignation, M. Fortunat\nreseated himself, to the intense disgust of Chupin, who was thoroughly\ntired of waiting outside in the cold.\n\n“I must tell you,” began Madame Vantrasson, “that when this happened--at\nleast twenty-five years ago--the De Chalusse family lived in the Rue\nSaint-Dominique. They occupied a superb mansion, with extensive grounds,\nfull of splendid trees like those in the Tuileries gardens. Mademoiselle\nHermine, who was then about eighteen or nineteen years old, was,\naccording to all accounts, the prettiest young creature ever seen. Her\nskin was as white as milk, she had a profusion of golden hair, and her\neyes were as blue as forget-me-nots. She was very kind and generous,\nthey say, only, like all the rest of the family, she was very haughty\nand obstinate--oh, obstinate enough to allow herself to be roasted alive\nover a slow fire rather than yield an inch. That’s the count’s nature\nexactly. Having served him, I know something about it, to be sure,\nand----”\n\n“Excuse me,” interrupted M. Fortunat, who was determined to prevent\nthese digressions, “and Mademoiselle Hermine?”\n\n“I was coming to her. Although she was very beautiful and immensely\nrich, she had no suitors--for it was generally understood that she was\nto marry a marquis, whose father was a particular friend of the family.\nThe parents had arranged the matter between them years before, and\nnothing was wanting but the young lady’s consent; but Mademoiselle\nHermine absolutely refused to hear the marquis’s name mentioned.\n\n“They did everything to persuade her to consent to this marriage; they\nemployed prayers and threats alike, but they might as well have talked\nto a stone. When they asked her why she refused to marry the marquis,\nshe replied, ‘Because’--and that was all. In fact, at last she declared\nshe would leave home and take refuge in a convent, if they didn’t cease\nto torment her. Her relatives were certain there must be some reason\nfor her refusal. It isn’t natural for a girl to reject a suitor who\nis young, handsome, rich, and a marquis besides. Her friends suspected\nthere was something she wouldn’t confess; and M. Raymond swore that he\nwould watch his sister, and discover her secret.”\n\n“M. Raymond is the present Count de Chalusse, I suppose?” inquired M.\nFortunat.\n\n“Yes, monsieur. Such was the state of matters when, one night, the\ngardener thought he heard a noise in the pavilion, at the end of the\ngarden. This pavilion was very large. I have seen it. It contained\na sitting-room, a billiard-room, and a large fencing-hall. Naturally\nenough, the gardener got up to go and see what was the matter. As he\nleft the house, he fancied he saw two persons moving about among the\ntrees. He ran after them, but could find nothing. They had made their\nescape through a small gate leading from the garden into the street.\nWhen the gardener was telling me this story, he declared again and\nagain that he had fancied the noise he had heard was made by some of\nthe servants trying to leave the house secretly, and for this reason\nhe didn’t give the alarm. However, he hurried to the pavilion, but on\nseeing no light there, he went back to bed with an easy mind.”\n\n“And it was Mademoiselle Hermine eloping with a lover?” asked M.\nFortunat.\n\nMadame Vantrasson seemed as disappointed as an actor who has been\ndeprived of an opportunity of producing a grand effect. “Wait a moment,”\n she replied, “and you’ll see. The night passed, morning came, and\nthen the breakfast hour. But Mademoiselle Hermine did not make her\nappearance. Some one was sent to rap at her door--there was no answer.\nThe door was opened--the young lady was not in her room, and the bed had\nnot even been disturbed. In a few moments the whole household was in\nthe wildest commotion; the mother weeping, and the father half wild\nwith rage and sorrow. Of course, the next thought was of Mademoiselle\nHermine’s brother, and he was sent for. But, he, too, was not in his\nroom, and his bed had not been touched. The excitement was becoming\nfrenzy, when it occurred to the gardener to mention what he had heard\nand seen on the previous night. They hastened to the pavilion, and\ndiscovered what? Why, M. Raymond stretched upon the ground, stiff, cold,\nand motionless, weltering in his own blood. One of his rigid hands still\ngrasped a sword. They lifted him up, carried him to the house, laid him\nupon his bed, and sent for a physician. He had received two dangerous\nwounds; one in the throat, the other in the breast. For more than a\nmonth he hung between life and death, and six weeks elapsed before he\nhad strength to relate what had happened. He was lighting a cigar at his\nwindow when he thought he saw a woman’s form flit through the garden.\nA suspicion that it might be his sister flashed through his mind; so he\nhastened down, stole noiselessly into the pavilion, and there he found\nhis sister and a young man who was absolutely unknown to him. He might\nhave killed the intruder, but instead of doing so, he told him they\nwould fight then and there. Weapons were within reach, and they fought,\nwith the result that Raymond was wounded twice, in quick succession, and\nfell. His adversary, supposing him dead, thereupon fled from the spot,\ntaking Mademoiselle Hermine with him.”\n\nAt this point in her narrative Madame Vantrasson evinced a desire to\npause and draw a breath, and perhaps partake of some slight refreshment;\nbut M. Fortunat was impatient. The woman’s husband might return at any\nmoment. “And, after that?” he inquired.\n\n“After that--well--M. Raymond recovered, and in about three months’\ntime he was out again; but the parents, who were old folks, had received\ntheir death-blow. They never rallied from the shock. Perhaps they felt\nthat it was their own hard-heartedness and obstinacy that had caused\ntheir daughter’s ruin--and remorse is hard to bear. They waned\nperceptibly from day to day, and during the following year they were\nborne to the cemetery within two months of each other.”\n\nFrom the spurious clerk’s demeanor it was easy to see that he had ceased\nthinking about his omnibus, and his hostess felt both reassured and\nflattered. “And Mademoiselle Hermine?” he inquired, eagerly.\n\n“Alas! monsieur, no one ever knew where she went, or what became of\nher.”\n\n“Didn’t they try to find her?”\n\n“They searched for her everywhere, for I don’t know how long; all the\nablest detectives in France and in foreign countries tried to find her,\nbut not one of them succeeded in discovering the slightest trace of her\nwhereabouts. M. Raymond promised an enormous sum to the man who would\nfind his sister’s betrayer. He wished to kill him, and he sought for him\nfor years; but all in vain.”\n\n“And did they never receive any tidings of this unfortunate girl?”\n\n“I was told that they heard from her twice. On the morning following\nher flight her parents received a letter, in which she implored their\nforgiveness. Five or six months later, she wrote again to say that she\nknew her brother was not dead. She confessed that she was a wicked,\nungrateful girl--that she had been mad; but she said that her punishment\nhad come, and it was terrible. She added that every link was severed\nbetween herself and her friends, and she hoped they would forget her as\ncompletely as if she had never existed. She went so far as to say that\nher children should never know who their mother was, and that never in\nher life again would she utter the name which she had so disgraced.”\n\nIt was the old, sad story of a ruined girl paying for a moment’s madness\nwith her happiness and all her after life. A terrible drama, no doubt;\nbut one that is of such frequent occurrence that it seems as commonplace\nas life itself. Thus any one who was acquainted with M. Isidore Fortunat\nwould have been surprised to see how greatly he was moved by such a\ntrifle. “Poor girl!” said he, in view of saying something. And then, in\na tone of assumed carelessness, he inquired: “Did they never discover\nwhat scoundrel carried Mademoiselle de Chalusse away?”\n\n“Never. Who he was, whence he came, whether he was young or old, how he\nbecame acquainted with Mademoiselle Hermine--these questions were never\nanswered. It was rumored at one time that he was an American, a captain\nin the navy; but that was only a rumor. To tell the truth, they never\neven discovered his name.”\n\n“What, not even his name?”\n\n“Not even his name.”\n\nUnable to master his emotion, M. Fortunat had at least the presence of\nmind to rise and step back into the darker part of the shop. But his\ngesture of disappointment and the muttered oath that fell from his lips\ndid not escape Madame Vantrasson. She was startled, and from that moment\nshe looked upon the supposed clerk with evident distrust. It was not\nlong before he again resumed his seat nearer the counter, still a\ntrifle pale, perhaps, but apparently calm. Two questions more seemed\nindispensable to him, and yet either one of them would be sure to arouse\nsuspicion. Nevertheless, he resolved to incur the risk of betraying\nhimself. And, after all, what would it matter now? Did he not possess\nthe information he had wished for, at least as much of it as it was in\nthis woman’s power to impart? “I can scarcely tell you, my dear madame,\nhow much your narrative has interested me,” he began. “I can confess\nnow that I am slightly acquainted with the Count de Chalusse, and that I\nhave frequently visited the house in the Rue de Courcelles, where he now\nresides.”\n\n“You!” exclaimed the woman, taking a hasty inventory of M. Fortunat’s\ntoilette.\n\n“Yes, I--on the part of my employer, understand. Each time I’ve been\nto visit M. de Chalusse’s I’ve seen a young lady whom I took for his\ndaughter there. I was wrong, no doubt, since he isn’t a married man--”\n\nHe paused. Astonishment and anger seemed to be almost suffocating his\nhostess. Without understanding how or why, she felt convinced that she\nhad been duped; and if she had obeyed her first impulse she would have\nattacked M. Isidore then and there. If she restrained this impulse, if\nshe made an effort to control herself, it was only because she thought\nshe held a better revenge in reserve.\n\n“A young lady in the count’s house!” she said, thoughtfully. “That’s\nscarcely possible. I’ve never seen her; I’ve never heard her spoken of.\nHow long has she been there?”\n\n“For six or seven months?”\n\n“In that case, I can’t absolutely deny it. It’s two years since I set\nfoot in the count’s house.”\n\n“I fancied this young lady might be the count’s niece Mademoiselle\nHermine’s daughter.”\n\nMadame Vantrasson shook her head. “Put that fancy out of your head,”\n she remarked. “The count said that his sister was dead to him from the\nevening of her flight.”\n\n“Who CAN this young girl be, then?”\n\n“Bless me! I don’t know. What sort of a looking person is she?”\n\n“Very tall; a brunette.”\n\n“How old is she?”\n\n“Eighteen or nineteen.”\n\nThe woman made a rapid calculation on her fingers. “Nine and four are\nthirteen,” she muttered, “and five are eighteen. Ah, ha!--why not? I\nmust look into this.”\n\n“What did you say?”\n\n“Nothing; a little reflection I was making to myself. Do you know this\nyoung lady’s name?”\n\n“It’s Marguerite.”\n\nThe woman’s face clouded. “No; it can’t be then,” she muttered, in a\nscarcely audible voice.\n\nM. Fortunat was on coals of fire. It was evident that this frightful\ncreature, even if she knew nothing definite, had some idea, some vague\nsuspicion of the truth. How could he compel her to speak now that she\nwas on her guard? He had not time to ascertain, for the door suddenly\nopened, and Vantrasson appeared on the threshold. He was scarcely sober\nwhen he left the shop, but now he was fairly drunk; his heavy shamble\nhad become a stagger. “Oh, you wretch, you brigand!” howled his wife;\n“you’ve been drinking again!”\n\nHe succeeded in maintaining his equilibrium, and, gazing at her with the\nphlegmatic stare peculiar to intoxicated men, he replied: “Well, what\nof that! Can’t I have a little pleasure with my friends? I came across\na couple of men who were just taking their fifteenth glass; why should I\nrefuse a compliment?”\n\n“You can’t hold yourself up.”\n\n“That’s true.” And to prove it he tumbled on to a chair.\n\nA torrent of abuse now flowed from Madame Vantrasson’s lips! M.\nFortunat only imperfectly distinguished the words “thief,” “spy,” and\n“detective;” but he could not mistake the meaning of the looks which she\nalternately gave her husband and himself. “It’s a fortunate thing for\nyou that my husband is in this condition,” her glances plainly implied,\n“otherwise there would be an explanation, and then we should see--”\n\n“I’ve had a lucky escape,” thought the spurious clerk. But as matters\nstood there was nothing to fear. It was a case where one could show a\nbrave front to the enemy without incurring the slightest danger. “Let\nyour husband alone,” said he. “If he has only brought the paper that he\nwas sent to fetch, I sha’n’t have lost my evening to oblige you.”\n\nVantrasson had brought not one sheet of stamped paper, but two. A bad\npen and some muddy ink were produced, and M. Fortunat began to draw up\nan acknowledgment according to the established formula. However, it was\nnecessary to mention the name of the creditor of whom he had spoken, and\nnot wishing to state his own, he used that of poor Victor Chupin, who\nwas at that very moment shivering at the door, little suspecting what\nliberty was being taken with his cognomen.\n\n“Chupin!” repeated the vixen, as if to engrave the name on her memory;\n“Victor Chupin! I should just like to see him,” she added, viciously.\n\nWhen the document was finished, it became necessary to wake Vantrasson,\nso that he might sign it. He did so with very good grace, and his wife\nappended her signature beside her husband’s. Thereupon M. Fortunat gave\nthem in exchange the note which had served as a pretext for his visit.\n“And above all,” he remarked, as he opened the door to go, “don’t forget\nthat you are to pay something on account each month.”\n\n“Go to the devil, and your account with you!” growled Madame Vantrasson.\n\nBut Fortunat did not hear this. He was already walking down the road\nby the side of Chupin, who was saying: “Well, here you are, at last,\nm’sieur! I thought you had taken a lease of that old barrack. If ever I\ncome here again, I’ll bring a foot-warmer with me.”\n\nBut one of those fits of profound abstraction to which determined\nseekers after truth are subject had taken possession of M. Fortunat, and\nmade him oblivious of all surrounding circumstances. His heart had been\nfull of hope when he reached the Asnieres Road, but he went away gloomy\nand despondent; and quite unconscious of the darkness, the mud, and the\nrain, which was again falling, he silently plodded along in the middle\nof the highway. Chupin was obliged to stop him at the city gate, and\nremind him that the cab was waiting.\n\n“That’s true,” was M. Fortunat’s only answer. He entered the vehicle,\ncertainly without knowing it; and as they rolled homeward, the thoughts\nthat filled his brain to overflowing found vent in a sort of monologue,\nof which Chupin now and then caught a few words. “What a piece of\nbusiness!” he muttered--“what a piece of business! I’ve had seven years’\nexperience in such matters, and yet I’ve never met with an affair\nso shrouded in mystery. My forty thousand francs are in a precarious\ncondition. Certainly I’ve lost money before through heirs whose\nexistence I hadn’t even suspected; but by reinstating these same heirs\nin their rights, I’ve regained my lost money, and received a handsome\nreward in addition; but in this case all is darkness; there isn’t a\nsingle gleam of light--not the slightest clew. If I could only find\nthem! But how can I search for people whose names I don’t even know--for\npeople who have escaped all the inquiries of the police? And where shall\nI look for them--in Europe, in America? It would be sheer madness! To\nwhom, then, will the count’s millions go?”\n\nIt was only the sudden stoppage of the cab in front of his own door that\nrecalled M. Fortunat to the realities of life. “Here are twenty\nfrancs, Victor,” he said to Chupin. “Pay the driver, and keep the rest\nyourself.”\n\nAs he spoke, he sprang nimbly to the ground. A handsome brougham, drawn\nby two horses, was standing before the house. “The Marquis de Valorsay’s\ncarriage,” muttered M. Fortunat. “He has been very patient; he has\nwaited for me--or, rather, he has waited for my ten thousand francs.\nWell, we shall see.”\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nM. Fortunat had scarcely started off on his visit to the Vantrassons\nwhen the Marquis de Valorsay reached the Place de la Bourse.\n\n“Monsieur has gone out,” said Madame Dodelin, as she opened the door.\n\n“You must be mistaken, my good woman.”\n\n“No, no; my master said you would, perhaps, wait for him.”\n\n“Very well; I will do so.”\n\nFaithful to the orders she had received, the servant conducted the\nvisitor to the drawing-room, lit the tapers in the candelabra, and\nretired. “This is very strange!” growled the marquis. “Monsieur Fortunat\nmakes an appointment, Monsieur Fortunat expects me to wait for him! What\nwill happen next?” However, he drew a newspaper from his pocket, threw\nhimself into an arm-chair, and waited.\n\nBy his habits and tastes, the Marquis de Valorsay belonged to that\nsection of the aristocracy which has coined the term “high life” in view\nof describing its own manners and customs. The matters that engrossed\nthe marquis’s frivolous mind were club-life and first performances at\nthe opera and the leading theatres, social duties and visits to the\nfashionable watering-places, racing and the shooting and hunting\nseasons, together with his mistress and his tailor.\n\nHe considered that to ride in a steeple-chase was an act of prowess\nworthy of his ancestors; and when he galloped past the stand, clad as\na jockey, in top-boots and a violet silk jacket, he believed he read\nadmiration in every eye. This was his every-day life, which had been\nenlivened by a few salient episodes: two duels, an elopement with a\nmarried woman, a twenty-six hours’ seance at the gaming table, and a\nfall from his horse, while hunting, which nearly cost him his life.\nThese acts of valor had raised him considerably in the estimation of\nhis friends, and procured him a celebrity of which he was not a little\nproud. The newspaper reporters were constantly mentioning his name, and\nthe sporting journals never failed to chronicle his departure from Paris\nor his arrival in the city.\n\nUnfortunately, such a life of busy idleness has its trials and its\nvicissitudes, and M. de Valorsay was a living proof of this. He was only\nthirty-three, but in spite of the care he expended upon his toilette,\nhe looked at least forty. Wrinkles were beginning to show themselves;\nit required all the skill of his valet to conceal the bald spots on his\ncranium; and since his fall from his horse, he had been troubled by\na slight stiffness in his right leg, which stiffness became perfect\nlameness in threatening weather. Premature lassitude pervaded his\nentire person, and when he relaxed in vigilance even his eyes betrayed\na distaste for everything--weariness, satiety as it were. All the same,\nhowever, he bore himself with an undeniable air of distinction, albeit\nthe haughtiness of his manner indicated an exaggerated idea of his own\nimportance. He was indeed in the habit of treating all those whom he\nconsidered his inferiors with supercilious sufficiency.\n\nThe clock on M. Fortunat’s mantel-shelf struck eleven at last and the\nmarquis rose to his feet with a muttered oath. “This is too much!” he\ngrowled, angrily.\n\nHe looked about for a bell, and seeing none, he was reduced to the dire\nnecessity of opening the door himself, and calling some one. Madame\nDodelin answered the summons. “Monsieur said he would return before\nmidnight,” she replied; “so he will certainly be here. There is no one\nlike him for punctuality. Won’t monsieur have patience a little longer?”\n\n“Well, I will wait a few moments; but, my good woman, light the fire; my\nfeet are frozen!”\n\nM. Fortunat’s drawing-room being used but seldom, was really as frigid\nas an iceberg; and to make matters still worse, M. de Valorsay was in\nevening dress, with only a light overcoat. The servant hesitated for an\ninstant, thinking this visitor difficult to please, and inclined to make\nhimself very much at home, still she obeyed.\n\n“I think I ought to go,” muttered the marquis. “I really think I\nought to go.” And yet he remained. Necessity, it should be remembered,\neffectually quiets the revolts of pride.\n\nLeft an orphan in his early childhood, placed in possession of an\nimmense fortune at the age of twenty-three, M. de Valorsay had entered\nlife like a famished man enters a dining-room. His name entitled him to\na high position in the social world; and he installed himself at table\nwithout asking how much the banquet might cost him. It cost him dear,\nas he discovered at the end of the first year, on noting that his\ndisbursements had considerably exceeded his large income. It was very\nevident that if he went on in this way, each twelvemonth would deepen\nan abyss where in the one hundred and sixty thousand francs a year, left\nhim by his father, would finally be swallowed up. But he had plenty of\ntime to reflect upon this unpleasant possibility ere it could come to\npass! And, besides, he found his present life so delightful, and he\nobtained so much gratification for his money, that he was unwilling to\nmake any change. He possessed several fine estates, and he found plenty\nof men who were only too glad to lend him money on such excellent\nsecurity. He borrowed timidly at first, but more boldly when he\ndiscovered what a mere trifle a mortgage is. Moreover, his wants\nincreased in proportion to his vanity. Occupying a certain position in\nthe opinion of his acquaintances, he did not wish to descend from the\nheights to which they had exalted him; and the very fact that he had\nbeen foolishly extravagant one year made it necessary for him to be\nguilty of similar folly during the succeeding twelvemonth. He failed to\npay his creditors the interest that was due on his loans. They did not\nask him for it; and perhaps he forgot that it was slowly but surely\naccumulating, and that at the end of a certain number of years the\namount of his indebtedness would be doubled. He never thought what the\nend would be. He became absolutely ignorant of the condition of his\naffairs, and really arrived at the conclusion that his resources were\ninexhaustible. He believed this until one day when on going to his\nlawyer for some money, that gentleman coldly said: “You requested me to\nobtain one hundred thousand francs for you, Monsieur le Marquis--but I\nhave only been able to procure fifty thousand--here they are. And do not\nhope for more. All your real estate is encumbered beyond its value. Your\ncreditors will probably leave you in undisturbed possession for another\nyear--it will be to their interest--but when it has elapsed they will\ntake possession of their own, as they have a perfect right to do.” Then,\nwith a meaning smile, the smile of a wily prime minister, he added: “If\nI were in your place, Monsieur le Marquis, I would profit by this year\nof grace. You undoubtedly understand what I mean. I have the honor to\nwish you good-morning.”\n\nWhat an awakening--after a glorious dream that had lasted for ten years.\nM. de Valorsay was stunned--crushed. For three days he remained immured\nin his own room, obstinately refusing to receive any one. “The marquis\nis ill,” was his valet’s answer to every visitor.\n\nM. de Valorsay felt that he must have time to regain his mental\nequilibrium--to look his situation calmly in the face. It was a\nfrightful one, for his ruin was complete, absolute. He could save\nnothing from the wreck. What was to become of him? What could he do? He\nset his wits to work; but he found that he was incapable of plying any\nkind of avocation. All the energy he had been endowed with by nature had\nbeen squandered--exhausted in pandering to his self-conceit. If he had\nbeen younger he might have turned soldier; but at his age he had not\neven this resource. Then it was that his notary’s smile recurred to\nhis mind. “His advice was decidedly good,” he muttered. “All is not yet\nlost; one way of escape still remains--marriage.”\n\nAnd why, indeed, shouldn’t he marry, and marry a rich wife too? No one\nknew anything about his misfortune; for a year at least, he would retain\nall the advantages that wealth bestows upon its possessor. His name\nalone was a great advantage. It would be very strange if he could not\nfind some manufacturer’s or banker’s daughter who would be only too\ndelighted to have a marquisial coronet emblazoned on her carriage\npanels.\n\nHaving arrived at this conclusion, M. de Valorsay began his search, and\nit was not long before he thought he had found what he was seeking.\nBut something was still necessary. The bestowers of large dowers are\ninclined to be suspicious; they like to have a clear understanding as to\nthe financial position of the suitors who present themselves, and they\nnot unfrequently ask for information. Accordingly, before committing\nhimself, M. de Valorsay understood that it was necessary he should\nprovide himself with an intelligent and devoted adviser. There must be\nsome one to hold his creditors in check, to silence them, and obtain\nsundry concessions from them--in a word, some one to interest them in\nhis success. With this object in view, M. de Valorsay applied to his\nnotary; but the latter utterly refused to mix himself up in any such\naffair, and declared that the marquis’s suggestion was almost an insult.\nThen touched, perhaps, by his client’s apparent despair, he said, “But\nI can mention a person who might be of service to you. Go to M. Isidore\nFortunat, No. 27 Place de la Bourse. If you succeed in interesting him\nin your marriage, it is an accomplished fact.”\n\nIt was under these circumstances that the marquis became acquainted with\nM. Fortunat. M. de Valorsay was a man of no little penetration, and on\nhis first visit he carefully weighed his new acquaintance. He found\nhim to be the very counsellor he desired--prudent, and at the same\ntime courageous; fertile in expedients; a thorough master of the art\nof evading the law, and not at all troubled by scruples. With such\nan adviser, it would be mere child’s play to conceal his financial\nembarrassments and deceive the most suspicious father-in-law. So M. de\nValorsay did not hesitate a moment. He frankly disclosed his pecuniary\ncondition and his matrimonial hopes, and concluded by promising M.\nFortunat a certain percentage on the bride’s dowry, to be paid on the\nday following the marriage.\n\nAfter a prolonged conference, the agreement was drawn up and signed,\nand that very day M. Fortunat took the nobleman’s interests in hand. How\nheartily, and with what confidence in his success, is shown by the fact\nthat he had advanced forty thousand francs for his client’s use, out\nof his own private purse. After such a proof of confidence the marquis\ncould hardly have been dissatisfied with his adviser; in point of fact,\nhe was delighted with him, and all the more so, as this invaluable man\nalways treated him with extreme deference, verging on servility. And\nin M. de Valorsay’s eyes this was a great consideration; for he was\nbecoming more arrogant and more irascible in proportion as his right to\nbe so diminished. Secretly disgusted with himself, and deeply humiliated\nby the shameful intrigue to which he had stooped, he took a secret\nsatisfaction in crushing his accomplice with his imaginary superiority\nand lordly disdain. According as his humor was good or bad, he\ncalled him “my dear extortioner,” “Mons. Fortunat,” or “Master\nTwenty-per-cent.” But though these sneers and insults drove the\nobsequious smile from M. Fortunat’s lips, he was quite capable of\nincluding them in the bill under the head of sundries.\n\nThe unvarying deference and submission which M. de Valorsay’s adviser\ndisplayed made his failure to keep the present appointment all the\nmore remarkable. Such neglect of the commonest rules of courtesy was\ninconceivable on the part of so polite a man; and the marquis’s anger\ngradually changed to anxiety. “What can have happened?” he thought.\n\nHe was trying to decide whether he should leave or stay, when he heard a\nkey grate in the lock of the outer door, and then some quick steps\nalong the ante-room. “At last--here he is!” he muttered, with a sigh of\nrelief.\n\nHe expected to see M. Fortunat enter the room at once, but he was\ndisappointed. The agent had no desire to show himself in the garb which\nhe had assumed for his excursion with Chupin; and so he had hastened to\nhis room to don his wonted habiliments. He also desired a few moments\nfor deliberation.\n\nIf--as was most probably the case--M. de Valorsay were ignorant of the\nCount de Chalusse’s critical condition, was it advisable to tell him of\nit? M. Fortunat thought not, judging with reason that this would lead\nto a discussion and very possibly to a rupture, and he wished to avoid\nanything of the kind until he was quite certain of the count’s death.\n\nMeanwhile the marquis was thinking--he was a trifle late about it--that\nhe had done wrong to wait in that drawing-room for three mortal hours.\nWas such conduct worthy of him? Had he shown himself proper respect?\nWould not M. Fortunat construe this as an acknowledgment of the\nimportance of his services and his client’s urgent need? Would he not\nbecome more exacting, more exorbitant in his demands? If the marquis\ncould have made his escape unheard, he would, no doubt, have done so;\nbut this was out of the question. So he resorted to a stratagem which\nseemed to him likely to save his compromised dignity. He stretched\nhimself out in his arm-chair, closed his eyes, and pretended to doze.\nThen, when M. Fortunat at last entered the drawing-room he sprang up\nas if he were suddenly aroused from slumber, rubbed his eyes, and\nexclaimed: “Eh! what’s that? Upon my word I must have been asleep!”\n\nBut M. Fortunat was not deceived. He noticed, on the floor, a torn and\ncrumpled newspaper, which betrayed the impatience and anger his client\nhad experienced during his long waiting. “Well,” resumed the marquis,\n“what time is it? Half-past twelve? This is a pretty time to keep an\nappointment fixed for ten o’clock. This is presuming on my good-nature,\nM. Fortunat! Do you know that my carriage has been waiting below ever\nsince half-past nine, and that my horses have, perhaps, taken cold? A\npair of horses worth six hundred louis!”\n\nM. Fortunat listened to these reproaches with the deepest humility. “You\nmust excuse me, Monsieur le Marquis,” said he. “If I remained out so\nmuch later than usual, it was only because your business interests\ndetained me.”\n\n“Zounds! that is about the same as if it had been your own business that\ndetained you!” And well pleased with this joke, he added, “Ah well! How\nare affairs progressing?”\n\n“On my side as well as could be desired.”\n\nThe marquis had resumed his seat in the chimney-corner, and was poking\nthe fire with a haughty, but poorly assumed air of indifference. “I am\nlistening,” he said carelessly.\n\n“In that case, Monsieur le Marquis, I will state the facts in a few\nwords, without going into particulars. Thanks to an expedient devised\nby me, we shall obtain for twenty hours a release from all the mortgages\nthat now encumber your estates. On that very day we will request a\ncertificate from the recorder. This certificate will declare that your\nestates are free from all encumbrances; you will show this statement to\nM. de Chalusse, and all his doubts--that is, if he has any--will vanish.\nThe plan was very simple; the only difficulty was about raising the\nmoney, but I have succeeded in doing so. All your creditors but two lent\nthemselves very readily to the arrangement. I have now won the consent\nof the two who at first refused, but we shall have to pay dearly for it.\nIt will cost you about twenty-six thousand francs.”\n\nM. de Valorsay was so delighted that he could not refrain from clapping\nhis hands. “Then the affair is virtually concluded,” he exclaimed.\n“In less than a month Mademoiselle Marguerite will be the Marquise de\nValorsay, and I shall have a hundred thousand francs a year again.”\n Then, noting how gravely M. Fortunat shook his head: “Ah! so you doubt\nit!” he cried. “Very well; now it is your turn to listen. Yesterday I\nhad a long conference with the Count de Chalusse, and everything has\nbeen settled. We exchanged our word of honor, Master Twenty-per-cent.\nThe count does things in a princely fashion; he gives Mademoiselle\nMarguerite two millions.”\n\n“Two millions!” the other repeated like an echo.\n\n“Yes, my dear miser, neither more nor less. Only for private reasons,\nwhich he did not explain, the count stipulates that only two hundred\nthousand francs shall appear in the marriage contract. The remaining\neighteen hundred thousand francs, he gives to me unreservedly and\nunconditionally. Upon my word, I think this very charming. How does it\nstrike you?”\n\nM. Fortunat made no reply. M. de Valorsay’s gayety, instead of cheering,\nsaddened him. “Ah! my fine fellow,” he thought, “you would sing a\ndifferent song if you knew that by this time M. de Chalusse is probably\ndead, and that most likely Mademoiselle Marguerite has only her\nbeautiful eyes left her, and will dim them in weeping for her vanished\nmillions.”\n\nBut this brilliant scion of the aristocracy had no suspicion of the\nreal state of affairs, for he continued: “You will say, perhaps, it is\nstrange, that I, Ange-Marie Robert Dalbou, Marquis de Valorsay, should\nmarry a girl whose father and mother no one knows, and whose only name\nis Marguerite. In this respect it is true that the match is not exactly\na brilliant one. Still, as it will appear that she merely has a fortune\nof two hundred thousand francs, no one will accuse me of marrying for\nmoney on the strength of my name. On the contrary, it will seem to be a\nlove-match, and people will suppose that I have grown young again.” He\npaused, incensed by M. Fortunat’s lack of enthusiasm. “Judging from\nyour long face, Master Twenty-per-cent, one would fancy you doubted my\nsuccess,” he said.\n\n“It is always best to doubt,” replied his adviser, philosophically.\n\nThe marquis shrugged his shoulders. “Even when one has triumphed over\nall obstacles?” he asked sneeringly.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then, tell me, if you please, what prevents this marriage from being a\nforegone conclusion?”\n\n“Mademoiselle Marguerite’s consent, Monsieur le Marquis.”\n\nIt was as if a glass of ice-water had been thrown in M. de Valorsay’s\nface. He started, turned as pale as death, and then exclaimed: “I shall\nhave that; I am sure of it.”\n\nYou could not say that M. Fortunat was angry. Such a man, as cold and\nas smooth as a hundred franc piece, has no useless passions. But he was\nintensely irritated to hear his client foolishly chanting the paeons of\nvictory, while he was compelled to conceal his grief at the loss of his\nforty thousand francs, deep in the recesses of his heart. So, far from\nbeing touched by the marquis’s evident alarm, it pleased him to be able\nto turn the dagger in the wound he had just inflicted. “You must\nexcuse my incredulity,” said he. “It comes entirely from something you,\nyourself, told me about a week ago.”\n\n“What did I tell you?”\n\n“That you suspected Mademoiselle Marguerite of a--how shall I express\nit?--of a secret preference for some other person.”\n\nThe gloomiest despondency had now followed the marquis’s enthusiasm and\nexultation. He was evidently in torture. “I more than suspected it,”\n said he.\n\n“Ah!”\n\n“I was certain of it, thanks to the count’s house-keeper, Madame Leon,\na miserable old woman whom I have hired to look after my interests. She\nhas been watching Mademoiselle Marguerite, and saw a letter written by\nher----”\n\n“Oh!”\n\n“Certainly nothing has passed that Mademoiselle Marguerite has any\ncause to blush for. The letter, which is now in my possession, contains\nunmistakable proofs of that. She might proudly avow the love she has\ninspired, and which she undoubtedly returns. Yet----”\n\nM. Fortunat’s gaze was so intent that it became unbearable. “You see,\nthen,” he began, “that I had good cause to fear.”\n\nExasperated beyond endurance, M. de Valorsay sprang up so violently that\nhe overturned his chair. “No!” he exclaimed, “no, a thousand times no!\nYou are wrong--for the man who loves Mademoiselle Marguerite is now\nruined. Yes, such is really the case. While we are sitting here, at this\nvery moment, he is lost--irredeemably lost. Between him and the woman\nwhom I wish to marry--whom I SHALL marry--I have dug so broad and deep\nan abyss that the strongest love cannot overleap it. It is better\nand worse than if I had killed him. Dead, he would have been mourned,\nperhaps; while now, the lowest and most degraded woman would turn from\nhim in disgust, or, even if she loved him, she would not dare to confess\nit.”\n\nM. Fortunat seemed greatly disturbed. “Have you then put into execution\nthe project--the plan you spoke of?” he faltered. “I thought you were\nonly jesting.”\n\nThe marquis lowered his head. “Yes,” he answered.\n\nHis companion stood for a moment as if petrified, and then suddenly\nexclaimed: “What! You have done that--you--a gentleman?”\n\nM. de Valorsay paced the floor in a state of intense agitation. Had he\ncaught a glimpse of his own face in the looking-glass, it would have\nfrightened him. “A gentleman!” he repeated, in a tone of suppressed\nrage; “a gentleman! That word is in everybody’s mouth, nowadays. Pray,\nwhat do you understand by a gentleman, Mons. Fortunat? No doubt, you\nmean a heroic idiot who passed through life with a lofty mien, clad in\nall the virtues, as stoical as Job, and as resigned as a martyr--a sort\nof moral Don Quixote, preaching the austerest virtue, and practising\nit? But, unfortunately, nobility of soul and of purpose are expensive\nluxuries, and I am a ruined man. I am no saint! I love life and all that\nmakes life beautiful and desirable--and to procure its pleasures I must\nfight with the weapons of the age. No doubt, it is grand to be honest;\nbut in my case it is so impossible, that I prefer to be dishonest--to\ncommit an act of shameful infamy which will yield a hundred thousand\nfrancs a year. This man is in my way--I suppress him--so much the worse\nfor him--he has no business to be in my way. If I could have met him\nopenly, I would have dispatched him according to the accepted code of\nhonor; but, then, I should have had to renounce all idea of marrying\nMademoiselle Marguerite, so I was obliged to find some other way. I\ncould not choose my means. The drowning man does not reject the plank,\nwhich is his only chance of salvation, because it chances to be dirty.”\n\nHis gestures were even more forcible than his words; and when he\nconcluded, he threw himself on to the sofa, holding his head tightly\nbetween his hands, as if he felt that it was bursting. Anger choked\nhis utterance--not anger so much as something he would not confess,\nthe quickening of his own conscience and the revolt of every honorable\ninstinct; for, in spite of his sins of omission, and of commission,\nnever, until this day, had he actually violated any clause of the code\nacknowledged by men of honor.\n\n“You have been guilty of a most infamous act, Monsieur le Marquis,” said\nM. Fortunat, coldly.\n\n“Oh! no moralizing, if you please.”\n\n“Only evil will come of it.”\n\nThe marquis shrugged his shoulders, and in a tone of bitter scorn,\nretorted: “Come, Mons. Fortunat, if you wish to lose the forty thousand\nfrancs you advanced to me, it’s easy enough to do so. Run to Madame\nd’Argeles’s house, ask for M. de Coralth, and tell him I countermand my\norder. My rival will be saved, and will marry Mademoiselle Marguerite\nand her millions.”\n\nM. Fortunat remained silent. He could not tell the marquis: “My\nforty thousand francs are lost already. I know that only too well.\nMademoiselle Marguerite is no longer the possessor of millions, and you\nhave committed a useless crime.” However, it was this conviction which\nimparted such an accent of eagerness to his words as he continued to\nplead the cause of virtue and of honesty. Would he have said as much\nif he had entertained any great hope of the success of the marquis’s\nmatrimonial enterprise? It is doubtful, still we must do M. Fortunat the\njustice to admit that he was really and sincerely horrified by what he\nhad unhesitatingly styled an “infamous act.”\n\nThe marquis listened to his agent for a few moments in silence, and then\nrose to his feet again. “All this is very true,” he interrupted; “but\nI am, nevertheless, anxious to learn the result of my little plot. For\nthis reason, Monsieur Fortunat, give me at once the five hundred louis\nyou promised me, and I will then bid you good-evening.”\n\nThe agent had been preparing himself for this moment, and yet he\ntrembled. “I am deeply grieved, monsieur,” he replied, with a doleful\nsmile; “it was this matter that kept me out so much later than usual\nthis evening. I hoped to have obtained the money from a banker, who\nhas always accommodated me before--M. Prosper Bertomy, you know him: he\nmarried M. Andre Fauvel’s niece----”\n\n“Yes, I know; proceed, if you please.”\n\n“Ah, well! it was impossible for me to procure the money.”\n\nThe marquis had hitherto been pale, but now his face flushed crimson.\n“This is a jest, I suppose,” said he.\n\n“Alas!--unfortunately--no.”\n\nThere was a moment’s silence, which the marquis probably spent in\nreflecting upon the probable consequences of this disappointment, for\nit was in an almost threatening tone that he eventually exclaimed: “You\nknow that I must have this money at once--that I must have it.”\n\nM. Fortunat would certainly have preferred to lose a good pound of flesh\nrather than the sum of money mentioned; but, on the other hand, he felt\nthat it would not do for him to sever his connection with his client\nuntil the death of the Count de Chalusse was certain; and being anxious\nto save his money and to keep his client, his embarrassment was extreme.\n“It was the most unfortunate thing in the world,” he stammered; “I\napprehended no difficulty whatever--” Then, suddenly clapping his hand\nto his forehead, he exclaimed: “But, Monsieur le Marquis, couldn’t you\nborrow this amount from one of your friends, the Duke de Champdoce or\nthe Count de Commarin?--that would be a good idea.”\n\nM. de Valorsay was anything but unsophisticated, and his natural\nshrewdness had been rendered much more acute by the difficulties with\nwhich he had recently been obliged to contend. M. Fortunat’s confusion\nhad not escaped his keen glance; and this last suggestion aroused his\nsuspicions at once. “What!” he said, slowly, and with an air of evident\ndistrust. “YOU give me this advice, Master Twenty-per-cent. This is\nwonderful! How long is it since your opinions have undergone such a\nchange?”\n\n“My opinions?”\n\n“Yes. Didn’t you say to me during our first interview; ‘The thing that\nwill save you, is that you have never in your whole life borrowed\na louis from a friend. An ordinary creditor only thinks of a large\ninterest; and if that is paid him he holds his peace. A friend is never\nsatisfied until everybody knows that he has generously obliged you. It\nis far better to apply to a usurer.’ I thought all that very sensible,\nand I quite agreed with you when you added: ‘So, Monsieur le Marquis,\nno borrowing of this kind until after your marriage--not on any pretext\nwhatever. Go without eating rather than do it. Your credit is still\ngood; but it is being slowly undermined--and the indiscretion of a\nfriend who chanced to say: “I think Valorsay is hard up,” might fire the\ntrain, and then you’d explode.’”\n\nM. Fortunat’s embarrassment was really painful to witness. He was not\nusually wanting in courage, but the events of the evening had shaken his\nconfidence and his composure. The hope of gain and the fear of loss had\ndeprived him of his wonted clearness of mind. Feeling that he had just\ncommitted a terrible blunder, he racked his brain to find some way of\nrepairing it, and finding none, his confusion increased.\n\n“Did you, or didn’t you, use that language?” insisted M. de Valorsay.\n“What have you to say in reply?”\n\n“Circumstances----”\n\n“What circumstances?”\n\n“Urgent need--necessity. There is no rule without its exceptions. I did\nnot imagine you would be so rash. I have advanced you forty thousand\nfrancs in less than five months--it is outrageous. If I were in your\nplace, I would be more reasonable--I would economize----”\n\nHe paused! in fact, he was compelled to pause by the piercing glance\nwhich M. de Valorsay turned upon him. He was furious with himself. “I am\nlosing my wits,” he thought.\n\n“Still more wise counsel,” remarked the ruined nobleman ironically.\n“While you are about it, why don’t you advise me to sell my horses and\ncarriages, and establish myself in a garret in the Rue Amelot? Such a\ncourse would seem very natural, wouldn’t it? and, of course, it would\ninspire M. de Chalusse with boundless confidence!”\n\n“But without going to such extremes----”\n\n“Hold your tongue!” interrupted the marquis, violently. “Better than any\none else you know that I cannot retrench, although the reality no longer\nexists. I am condemned, cost what it may, to keep up appearances. That\nis my only hope of salvation. I have gambled, given expensive suppers,\nindulged in dissipation of every kind, and I must continue to do so.\nI have come to hate Ninette Simplon, for whom I have committed so many\nacts of folly, and yet I still keep her--to show that I am rolling in\nwealth. I have thrown thousand-franc notes out of the window, and I\nmustn’t stop throwing them. Indeed, what would people say if I stopped!\nWhy, ‘Valorsay is a ruined man!’ Then, farewell to my hopes of marrying\nan heiress. And so I am always gay and smiling; that is part of my role.\nWhat would my servants--the twenty spies that I pay--what would they\nthink if they saw me thoughtful or disturbed? You would scarcely believe\nit, M. Fortunat, but I have positively been reduced to dining on credit\nat my club, because I had paid, that morning, for a month’s provender\nfor my horses! It is true I have many valuable articles in my house, but\nI cannot dispose of them. People would recognize them at once; besides,\nthey form a part of my stock-in-trade. An actor doesn’t sell his\ncostumes because he’s hungry--he goes without food--and when it’s time\nfor the curtain to rise, he dons his satin and velvet garments, and,\ndespite his empty stomach, he chants the praises of a bountiful table\nand rare old wine. That is what I am doing--I, Robert Dalbou, Marquis\nde Valorsay! At the races at Vincennes, about a fortnight ago, I was\nbowling along the boulevard behind my four-in-hand, when I heard a\nlaborer say, ‘How happy those rich people must be!’ Happy, indeed! Why,\nI envied him his lot. He was sure that the morrow would be like the\nday that preceded it. On that occasion my entire fortune consisted of\na single louis, which I had won at baccarat the evening before. As I\nentered the enclosure, Isabelle, the flower-girl, handed me a rose for\nmy button-hole. I gave her my louis--but I longed to strangle her!”\n\nHe paused for a moment, and then, in a frenzy of passion, he advanced\ntoward M. Fortunat, who instinctively retreated into the protecting\nembrasure of a window. “And for eight months I have lived this horrible\nlife!” he resumed. “For eight months each moment has been so much\ntorture. Ah! better poverty, prison, and shame! And now, when the prize\nis almost won, actuated either by treason or caprice, you try to make\nall my toil and all my suffering unavailing. You try to thwart me on the\nvery threshold of success! No! I swear, by God’s sacred name, it shall\nnot be! I will rather crush you, you miserable scoundrel--crush you like\na venomous reptile!”\n\nThere was such a ring of fury in his voice that the crystals of the\ncandelabra vibrated; and Madame Dodelin, in her kitchen, heard it, and\nshuddered. “Some one will certainly do M. Fortunat an injury one of\nthese days,” she thought.\n\nIt was not by any means the first time that M. Fortunat had found\nhimself at variance with clients of a sanguine temperament; but he\nhad always escaped safe and sound, so that, after all, he was not\nparticularly alarmed in the present instance, as was proved by the fact\nthat he was still calm enough to reflect and plan. “In forty-eight hours\nI shall be certain of the count’s fate,” he thought; “he will be dead,\nor he will be in a fair way to recovery--so by promising to give this\nfrenzied man what he desires on the day after to-morrow, I shall incur\nno risk.”\n\nTaking advantage of an opportunity which M. de Valorsay furnished,\non pausing to draw breath, he hastily exclaimed, “Really, Monsieur le\nMarquis, I cannot understand your anger.”\n\n“What! scoundrel!”\n\n“Excuse me. Before insulting me, permit me to explain----”\n\n“No explanation--five hundred louis!”\n\n“Have the kindness to allow me to finish. Yes, I know that you are in\nurgent need of money--not by-and-by, but now. To-day I was unable\nto procure it, nor can I promise it to-morrow; but on the day after\nto-morrow, Saturday, I shall certainly have it ready for you.”\n\nThe marquis seemed to be trying to read his agent’s very soul. “Are you\nin earnest?” he asked. “Show your hand. If you don’t intend to help me\nout of my embarrassment, say so.”\n\n“Ah, Monsieur le Marquis, am I not as much interested in your success\nas you yourself can be? Have you not received abundant proofs of my\ndevotion?”\n\n“Then I can rely upon you.”\n\n“Absolutely.” And seeing a lingering doubt in his client’s eyes, M.\nFortunat added, “You have my word of honor!”\n\nThe clock struck three. The marquis took his hat and started toward\nthe door. But M. Fortunat, in whose heart the word scoundrel was still\nrankling, stopped him. “Are you going to that lady’s house now? What\nis she called? I’ve forgotten her name. Ah, yes, I remember now. Madame\nd’Argeles, isn’t she called? It’s at her place, I believe, that the\nreputation of Mademoiselle Marguerite’s favored lover is to be ruined.”\n\nThe marquis turned angrily. “What do you take me for, Master\nTwenty-per-cent?” he rudely asked. “That is one of those things no\nwell-bred gentleman will do himself. But in Paris people can be found to\ndo any kind of dirty work, if you are willing to pay them for it.”\n\n“Then how will you know the result?”\n\n“Why, twenty minutes after the affair is over, M. de Coralth will be\nat my house. He is there even now, perhaps.” And as this subject was\nanything but pleasant, he hastened away, exclaiming, “Get to bed, my\ndear extortioner. Au revoir. And, above all, remember your promise.”\n\n“My respects, Monsieur le Marquis.”\n\nBut when the door closed, M. Fortunat’s expression immediately changed.\n“Ah! you insult me!” he muttered sullenly. “You rob me, and you call\nme a scoundrel into the bargain. You shall pay dearly for it, my fine\nfellow, no matter what may happen!”\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nIt is in vain that the law has endeavored to shield private life from\nprying eyes. The scribes who pander to Parisian curiosity surmount all\nobstacles and brave every danger. Thanks to the “High Life” reporters,\nevery newspaper reader is aware that twice a week--Mondays and\nThursdays--Madame Lia d’Argeles holds a reception at her charming\nmansion in the Rue de Berry. Her guests find plenty of amusement there.\nThey seldom dance; but card-playing begins at midnight, and a dainty\nsupper is served before the departure of the guests.\n\nIt was on leaving one of these little entertainments that that\nunfortunate young man, Jules Chazel, a cashier in a large banking-house,\ncommitted suicide by blowing out his brains. The brilliant frequenters\nof Madame d’Argeles’s entertainments considered this act proof of\nexceeding bad taste and deplorable weakness on his part. “The fellow was\na coward,” they declared. “Why, he had lost hardly a thousand louis!”\n\nHe had lost only that, it is true--a mere trifle as times go. Only the\nmoney was not his; he had taken it from the safe which was confided\nto his keeping, expecting, probably, to double the amount in a single\nnight. In the morning, when he found himself alone, without a penny, and\nthe deficit staring him in the face, the voice of conscience cried, “You\nare a thief!” and he lost his reason.\n\nThe event created a great sensation at the time, and the Petit Journal\npublished a curious story concerning this unfortunate young man’s\nmother. The poor woman--she was a widow--sold all she possessed, even\nthe bed on which she slept, and when she had succeeded in gathering\ntogether twenty thousand francs--the ransom of her son’s honor--she\ncarried them to the banker by whom her boy had been employed. He took\nthem, without even asking the mother if she had enough left to purchase\nher dinner that evening; and the fine gentleman, who had won and\npocketed Jules Chazel’s stolen gold, thought the banker’s conduct\nperfectly natural and just. It is true that Madame d’Argeles was in\ndespair during forty-eight hours or so; for the police had begun a sort\nof investigation, and she feared this might frighten her visitors and\nempty her drawing-rooms. Not at all, however; on the contrary, she had\ngood cause to congratulate herself upon the notoriety she gained through\nthis suicide. For five days she was the talk of Paris, and Alfred\nd’Aunay even published her portrait in the Illustrated Chronicle.\n\nStill, no one was able to say exactly who Madame Lia d’Argeles was. Who\nwas she, and whence did she come? How had she lived until she sprang up,\nfull grown, in the sunshine of the fashionable world? Did the splendid\nmansion in the Rue de Berry really belong to her? Was she as rich as she\nwas supposed to be? Where had she acquired such manners, the manners of\na thorough woman of the world, with her many accomplishments, as well as\nher remarkable skill as a musician? Everything connected with her was\na subject of conjecture, even to the name inscribed upon her visiting\ncards--“Lia d’Argeles.”\n\nBut no matter. Her house was always filled to over-flowing; and at the\nvery moment when the Marquis de Valorsay and M. Fortunat were speaking\nof her, a dozen coroneted carriages stood before her door, and her\nrooms were thronged with guests. It was a little past midnight, and the\nbi-weekly card party had just been made up, when a footman announced,\n“Monsieur le Vicomte de Coralth! Monsieur Pascal Ferailleur!”\n\nFew of the players deigned to raise their heads. But one man growled,\n“Good--two more players!” And four or five young men exclaimed, “Ah!\nhere’s Ferdinand! Good evening, my dear fellow!”\n\nM. de Coralth was very young and remarkably good-looking, almost too\ngood-looking, indeed; for his handsomeness was somewhat startling and\nunnatural. He had an exceedingly fair complexion, and large, melting\nblack eyes, while a woman might have envied him his wavy brown hair\nand the exquisite delicacy of his skin. He dressed with great care and\ntaste, and even coquettishly; his turn-down collar left his firm white\nthroat uncovered, and his rose-tinted gloves fitted as perfectly as the\nskin upon his soft, delicate hands. He bowed familiarly on entering,\nand with a rather complacent smile on his lips, he approached Madame\nd’Argeles, who, half reclining in an easy chair near the fire-place,\nwas conversing with two elderly gentlemen of grave and distinguished\nbearing. “How late you are, viscount,” she remarked carelessly. “What\nhave you been doing to-day? I fancied I saw you in the Bois, in the\nMarquis de Valorsay’s dog-cart.”\n\nA slight flush suffused M. de Coralth’s cheeks, and to hide it, perhaps,\nhe turned toward the visitor who had entered with him, and drew him\ntoward Madame d’Argeles, saying, “Allow me, madame, to present to you\none of my great friends, M. Pascal Ferailleur, an advocate whose name\nwill be known to fame some day.”\n\n“Your friends are always welcome at my house, my dear viscount,” replied\nMadame d’Argeles. And before Pascal had concluded his bow, she averted\nher head, and resumed her interrupted conversation.\n\nThe new-comer, however, was worthy of more than that cursory notice. He\nwas a young man of five or six-and-twenty, dark-complexioned and tall;\neach movement of his person was imbued with that natural grace which is\nthe result of perfect harmony of the muscles, and of more than common\nvigor. His features were irregular, but they gave evidence of energy,\nkindness of heart, and honesty of purpose. A man possessing such a\nproud, intelligent, and open brow, such a clear, straightforward gaze,\nand such finely-cut lips, could be no ordinary one. Deserted by his\nsponsor, who was shaking hands right and left, he seated himself on a\nsofa a little in the background; not because he was embarrassed, but\nbecause he felt that instinctive distrust of self which frequently\nseizes hold of a person on entering a crowd of strangers. He did his\nbest to conceal his curiosity, but nevertheless he looked and listened\nwith all his might.\n\nThe salon, was an immense apartment, divided into two rooms by sliding\ndoors and hangings. When Madame d’Argeles gave a ball, the rooms were\nthrown into one; but, as a general rule, one room was occupied by the\ncard-players, and the other served as a refuge for those who wished\nto chat. The card-room, into which Pascal had been ushered, was an\napartment of noble proportions, furnished in a style of tasteful\nmagnificence. The tints of the carpet were subdued; there was not too\nmuch gilding on the cornices; the clock upon the mantel-shelf was chaste\nand elegant in design. The only thing at all peculiar about the room\nand its appointments was a reflector, ingeniously arranged above the\nchandelier in such a way as to throw the full glare of the candles upon\nthe card-table which stood directly beneath it. The table itself was\nadorned with a rich tapestry cover, but this was visible only at\nthe corners, for it was covered, in turn, with a green baize cloth\nconsiderably the worse for wear. Madame d’Argeles’s guests were probably\nnot over fifty in number, but they all seemed to belong to the very best\nsociety. The majority of them were men of forty or thereabouts; several\nwore decorations, and two or three of the eldest were treated with\nmarked deference. Certain well-known names which Pascal overheard\nsurprised him greatly. “What! these men here?” he said to himself; “and\nI--I regarded my visit as a sort of clandestine frolic.”\n\nThere were only seven or eight ladies present, none of them being\nespecially attractive. Their toilettes were very costly, but in rather\ndoubtful taste, and they wore a profusion of diamonds. Pascal noticed\nthat these ladies were treated with perfect indifference, and that,\nwhenever the gentlemen spoke to them, they assumed an air of politeness\nwhich was too exaggerated not to be ironical.\n\nA score of persons were seated at the card-table, and the guests who had\nretired into the adjoining salon were silently watching the progress of\nthe game, or quietly chatting in the corners of the room. It surprised\nhim to note that every one spoke in very low tones; there was something\nvery like respect, even awe, in this subdued murmur. One might\nhave supposed that those present were celebrating the rites of some\nmysterious worship. And is not gaming a species of idolatry, symbolized\nby cards, and which has its images, its fetishes, its miracles, its\nfanatics, and its martyrs?\n\nOccasionally, above the accompaniment of whispers, rose the strange and\nincoherent exclamations of the players: “Here are twenty louis! I take\nit--I pass! The play is made! Banco!”\n\n“What a strange gathering!” thought Pascal Ferailleur. “What singular\npeople!” And he turned his attention to the mistress of the house, as if\nhe hoped to decipher the solution of the enigma on her face.\n\nBut Madame Lia d’Argeles defied all analysis. She was one of those women\nwhose uncertain age varies according to their mood, between the thirties\nand the fifties; one who did not look over thirty in the evening, but\nwho would have been charged with being more than fifty the next morning.\nIn her youth she must have been very beautiful, and she was still\ngood-looking, though she had grown somewhat stout, and her face had\nbecome a trifle heavy, thus marring the symmetry of her very delicate\nfeatures. A perfect blonde, she had eyes of so clear a blue that they\nseemed almost faded. The whiteness of her skin was so unnatural that it\nalmost startled one. It was the dull, lifeless white which suggests an\nexcessive use of cosmetics and rice powder, and long baths, late hours,\nand sleep at day-time, in a darkened room. Her face was utterly devoid\nof expression. One might have fancied that its muscles had become\nrelaxed after terrible efforts to feign or to conceal some violent\nemotions; and there was something melancholy, almost terrifying in the\neternal, and perhaps involuntary smile, which curved her lips. She wore\na dress of black velvet, with slashed sleeves and bodice, a new design\nof the famous man-milliner, Van Klopen.\n\nPascal was engaged in these observations when M. de Coralth, having made\nhis round, came and sat down on the sofa beside him. “Well, what do you\nthink of it?” he inquired.\n\n“Upon my word!” replied the young advocate, “I am infinitely obliged to\nyou for inviting me to accompany you here. I am intensely amused.”\n\n“Good! My philosopher is captivated.”\n\n“Not captivated, but interested, I confess.” Then, in the tone of\ngood-humor which was habitual to him, he added: “As for being the sage\nyou call me, that’s all nonsense. And to prove it, I’m going to risk my\nlouis with the rest.”\n\nM. de Coralth seemed amazed, but a close observer might have detected a\ngleam of triumph in his eyes. “You are going to play--you?”\n\n“Yes. Why not?”\n\n“Take care!”\n\n“Of what, pray? The worst I can do is to lose what I have in my\npocket--something over two hundred francs.”\n\nThe viscount shook his head thoughtfully. “It isn’t that which one has\ncause to fear. The devil always has a hand in this business, and the\nfirst time a man plays he’s sure to win.”\n\n“And is that a misfortune?”\n\n“Yes, because the recollection of these first winnings is sure to lure\nyou back to the gaming-table again. You go back, you lose, you try to\nrecover your money, and that’s the end of it--you become a gambler.”\n\nPascal Ferailleur’s smile was the smile of a man who has full confidence\nin himself. “My brain is not so easily turned, I hope,” said he. “I have\nthe thought of my name, and the fortune I must make, as ballast for it.”\n\n“I beseech you not to play,” insisted the viscount. “Listen to me; you\ndon’t know what this passion for play is; the strongest and the coldest\nnatures succumb--don’t play.”\n\nHe had raised his voice, as if he intended to be overheard by two guests\nwho had just approached the sofa. They did indeed hear him. “Can I\nbelieve my own eyes and ears!” exclaimed one of them, an elderly man.\n“Can this really be Ferdinand who is trying to shake the allegiance of\nthe votaries of our noble lady--the Queen of Spades?”\n\nM. de Coralth turned quickly round: “Yes, it is indeed I,” he answered.\n“I have purchased with my patrimony the right of saying: ‘Distrust\nyourself, and don’t do as I’ve done,’ to an inexperienced friend.”\n\nThe wisest counsels, given in a certain fashion, never fail to produce\nan effect diametrically opposed to that which they seemingly aim at.\nM. de Coralth’s persistence, and the importance he attached to a mere\ntrifle, could not fail to annoy the most patient man in the world, and\nin fact his patronizing tone really irritated Pascal. “You are free, my\nfriend, to do as you please,” said he; “but I----”\n\n“Are you resolved?” interrupted the viscount.\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\n“So be it, then. You are no longer a child, and I have warned you. Let\nus play, then.” Thereupon they approached the table; room was made\nfor them, and they seated themselves, Pascal being on M. Ferdinand de\nCoralth’s right-hand side.\n\nThe guests were playing “Baccarat tournant,” a game of terrible and\ninfantile simplicity. There are no such things as skill or combination\npossible in it; science and calculation are useless. Chance alone\ndecides, and decides with the rapidity of lightning. Amateurs certainly\nassert that, with great coolness and long practice, one can, in a\nmeasure at least, avert prolonged ill-luck. Maybe they are right, but\nit is not conclusively proved. Each person takes the cards in his turn,\nrisks what he chooses, and when his stakes are covered, deals. If he\nwins, he is free to follow up his vein of good-luck, or to pass the\ndeal. When he loses, the deal passes at once to the next player on the\nright.\n\nA moment sufficed for Pascal Ferailleur to learn the rules of the game.\nIt was already Ferdinand’s deal. M. de Coralth staked a hundred francs;\nthe bet was taken; he dealt, lost, and handed the cards to Pascal.\n\nThe play, which had been rather timid at first--since it was necessary,\nas they say, to try the luck--had now become bolder. Several players\nhad large piles of gold before them, and the heavy artillery--that is to\nsay, bank-notes--were beginning to put in appearance. But Pascal had no\nfalse pride. “I stake a louis!” said he\n\nThe smallness of the sum attracted instant attention, and two or three\nvoices replied: “Taken!”\n\nHe dealt, and won. “Two louis!” he said again. This wager was also\ntaken; he won, and his run of luck was so remarkable that, in a\nwonderfully short space of time, he won six hundred francs.\n\n“Pass the deal,” whispered Ferdinand, and Pascal followed this advice.\n“Not because I desire to keep my winnings,” he whispered in M. de\nCoralth’s ear, “but because I wish to have enough to play until the end\nof the evening without risking anything.”\n\nBut such prudence was unnecessary so far as he was concerned. When the\ndeal came to him again, fortune favored him even more than before.\nHe started with a hundred francs, and doubling them each time in six\nsuccessive deals, he won more than three thousand francs.\n\n“The devil! Monsieur is in luck.”--“Zounds! And he is playing for the\nfirst time.”--“That accounts for it. The inexperienced always win.”\n\nPascal could not fail to hear these comments. The blood mantled over\nhis cheeks, and, conscious that he was flushing, he, as usually happens,\nflushed still more. His good fortune embarrassed him, as was evident,\nand he played most recklessly. Still his good luck did not desert him;\nand do what he would he won--won continually. In fact, by four o’clock\nin the morning he had thirty-five thousand francs before him.\n\nFor some time he had been the object of close attention. “Do you know\nthis gentleman?” inquired one of the guests.\n\n“No. He came with Coralth.”\n\n“He is an advocate, I understand.”\n\nAnd all these whispered doubts and suspicions, these questions fraught\nwith an evil significance, these uncharitable replies, grew into a\nmalevolent murmur, which resounded in Pascal’s ears and bewildered\nhim. He was really becoming most uncomfortable, when Madame d’Argeles\napproached the card-table and exclaimed: “This is the third time,\ngentlemen, that you have been told that supper is ready. What gentleman\nwill offer me his arm?”\n\nThere was an evident unwillingness to leave the table, but an old\ngentleman who had been losing heavily rose to his feet. “Yes, let us go\nto supper!” he exclaimed; “perhaps that will change the luck.”\n\nThis was a decisive consideration. The room emptied as if by magic; and\nno one was left at the table but Pascal, who scarcely knew what to\ndo with all the gold piled up before him. He succeeded, however, in\ndistributing it in his pockets, and was about to join the other guests\nin the dining-room, when Madame d’Argeles abruptly barred his passage.\n\n“I desire a word with you, monsieur,” she said. Her face still retained\nits strange immobility, and the same stereotyped smile played about her\nlips. And yet her agitation was so evident that Pascal, in spite of his\nown uneasiness, noticed it, and was astonished by it.\n\n“I am at your service, madame,” he stammered, bowing.\n\nShe at once took his arm, and led him to the embrasure of a window. “I\nam a stranger to you, monsieur,” she said, very hurriedly, and in very\nlow tones, “and yet I must ask, and you must grant me, a great favor.”\n\n“Speak, madame.”\n\nShe hesitated, as if at a loss for words, and then all of a sudden she\nsaid, eagerly: “You will leave this house at once, without warning any\none, and while the other guests are at supper.”\n\nPascal’s astonishment changed into stupor.\n\n“Why am I to go?” he asked.\n\n“Because--but, no; I cannot tell you. Consider it only a caprice on my\npart--it is so; but I entreat you, don’t refuse me. Do me this favor,\nand I shall be eternally grateful.”\n\nThere was such an agony of supplication in her voice and her attitude,\nthat Pascal was touched. A vague presentiment of some terrible,\nirreparable misfortune disturbed his own heart. Nevertheless, he sadly\nshook his head, and bitterly exclaimed: “You are, perhaps, not aware\nthat I have just won over thirty thousand francs.”\n\n“Yes, I am aware of it. And this is only another, and still stronger\nreason why you should protect yourself against possible loss. It is well\nto pattern after Charlemagne [1] in this house. The other night, the\nCount d’Antas quietly made his escape bareheaded. He took a thousand\nlouis away with him, and left his hat in exchange. The count is a brave\nman; and far from indulging in blame, every one applauded him the next\nday. Come, you have decided, I see--you will go; and to be still more\nsafe, I will show you out through the servants’ hall, then no one can\npossibly see you.”\n\nPascal had almost decided to yield to her entreaties; but this proposed\nretreat through the back-door was too revolting to his pride to be\nthought of for a moment. “I will never consent to such a thing,” he\ndeclared. “What would they think of me? Besides I owe them their revenge\nand I shall give it to them.”\n\nNeither Madame d’Argeles nor Pascal had noticed M. de Coralth, who in\nthe meantime had stolen into the room on tiptoe, and had been listening\nto their conversation, concealed behind the folds of a heavy curtain. He\nnow suddenly revealed his presence. “Ah! my dear friend,” he exclaimed,\nin a winning tone. “While I honor your scruples, I must say that I think\nmadame is a hundred times right. If I were in your place, if I had won\nwhat you have won, I shouldn’t hesitate. Others might think what they\npleased; you have the money, that is the main thing.”\n\nFor the second time, the viscount’s intervention decided Pascal. “I\nshall remain,” he said, resolutely.\n\nBut Madame d’Argeles laid her hand imploringly on his arm. “I entreat\nyou, monsieur,” said she. “Go now, there is still time.”\n\n“Yes, go,” said the viscount, approvingly, “it would be a most excellent\nmove. Retreat and save the cash.”\n\nThese words were like the drop which makes the cup overflow. Crimson\nwith anger and assailed by the strangest suspicions, Pascal turned from\nMadame d’Argeles and hastened into the dining-room. The conversation\nceased entirely on his arrival there. He could not fail to understand\nthat he had been the subject of it. A secret instinct warned him that\nall the men around him were his enemies--though he knew not why--and\nthat they were plotting against him. He also perceived that his\nslightest movements were watched and commented upon. However he was a\nbrave man; his conscience did not reproach him in the least, and he was\none of those persons who, rather than wait for danger, provoke it.\n\nSo, with an almost defiant air, he seated himself beside a young\nlady dressed in pink tulle, and began to laugh and chat with her. He\npossessed a ready wit, and what is even better, tact; and for a quarter\nof an hour astonished those around him by his brilliant sallies.\nChampagne was flowing freely; and he drank four or five glasses in quick\nsuccession. Was he really conscious of what he was doing and saying? He\nsubsequently declared that he was not, that he acted under the influence\nof a sort of hallucination similar to that produced by the inhalation of\ncarbonic gas.\n\nHowever, the guests did not linger long at the supper-table. “Let us go\nback!” cried the old gentleman, who had insisted upon the suspension of\nthe game; “we are wasting a deal of precious time here!”\n\nPascal rose with the others, and in his haste to enter the adjoining\nroom he jostled two men who were talking together near the door. “So it\nis understood,” said one of them.\n\n“Yes, yes, leave it to me; I will act as executioner.”\n\nThis word sent all Pascal’s blood bounding to his heart. “Who is to be\nexecuted?” he thought? “I am evidently to be the victim. But what does it\nall mean?”\n\nMeanwhile the players at the green table had changed places, and Pascal\nfound himself seated not on Ferdinand’s right, but directly opposite\nhim, and between two men about his own age--one of them being the person\nwho had announced his intention of acting as executioner. All eyes were\nfixed upon the unfortunate advocate when it came his turn to deal. He\nstaked two hundred louis, and lost them. There was a slight commotion\nround the table; and one of the players who had lost most heavily,\nremarked in an undertone: “Don’t look so hard at the gentleman--he won’t\nhave any more luck.”\n\nAs Pascal heard this ironical remark, uttered in a tone which made it as\ninsulting as a blow, a gleam of light darted through his puzzled brain.\nHe suspected at last, what any person less honest than himself would\nhave long before understood. He thought of rising and demanding an\napology; but he was stunned, almost overcome by the horrors of his\nsituation. His ears tingled, and it seemed to him as if the beating of\nhis heart were suspended.\n\nHowever the game proceeded; but no one paid any attention to it. The\nstakes were insignificant, and loss or gain drew no exclamation from any\none. The attention of the entire party was concentrated on Pascal; and\nhe, with despair in his heart, followed the movements of the cards,\nwhich were passing from hand to hand, and fast approaching him again.\nWhen they reached him the silence became breathless, menacing, even\nsinister. The ladies, and the guests who were not playing, approached\nand leaned over the table in evident anxiety. “My God!” thought Pascal,\n“my God, if I can only lose!”\n\nHe was as pale as death; the perspiration trickled down from his hair\nupon his temples, and his hands trembled so much that he could scarcely\nhold the cards. “I will stake four thousand francs,” he faltered.\n\n“I take your bet,” answered a voice.\n\nAlas! the unfortunate fellow’s wish was not gratified; he won. Then\nin the midst of the wildest confusion, he exclaimed: “Here are eight\nthousand francs!”\n\n“Taken!”\n\nBut as he began to deal the cards, his neighbor sprang up, seized him\nroughly by the hands and cried: “This time I’m sure of it--you are a\nthief!”\n\nWith a bound, Pascal was on his feet. While his peril had been vague and\nundetermined, his energy had been paralyzed. But it was restored to him\nintact when his danger declared itself in all its horror. He pushed away\nthe man who had caught his hands, with such violence that he sent him\nreeling under a sofa; then he stepped back and surveyed the excited\nthrong with an air of menace and defiance. Useless! Seven or eight\nplayers sprang upon him and overpowered him, as if he had been the\nvilest criminal.\n\nMeanwhile, the executioner, as he had styled himself, had risen to his\nfeet with his cravat untied, and his clothes in wild disorder. “Yes,”\n he said, addressing Pascal, “you are a thief! I saw you slip other cards\namong those which were handed to you.”\n\n“Wretch!” gasped Pascal.\n\n“I saw you--and I am going to prove it.” So saying he turned to\nthe mistress of the house, who had dropped into an arm-chair, and\nimperiously asked, “How many packs have we used?”\n\n“Five.”\n\n“Then there ought to be two hundred and sixty cards upon the table.”\n\nThereupon he counted them slowly and with particular care, and he found\nno fewer than three hundred and seven. “Well, scoundrel!” he cried; “are\nyou still bold enough to deny it?”\n\nPascal had no desire to deny it. He knew that words would weigh as\nnothing against this material, tangible, incontrovertible proof.\nForty-seven cards had been fraudulently inserted among the others.\nCertainly not by him! But by whom? Still he, alone, had been the gainer\nthrough the deception.\n\n“You see that the coward will not even defend himself!” exclaimed one of\nthe women.\n\nHe did not deign to turn his head. What did the insult matter to him? He\nknew himself to be innocent, and yet he felt that he was sinking to the\nlowest depths of infamy--he beheld himself disgraced, branded, ruined.\nAnd realizing that he must meet facts with facts, he besought God to\ngrant him an idea, an inspiration, that would unmask the real culprit.\n\nBut another person came to his aid. With a boldness which no one would\nhave expected on his part, M. de Coralth placed himself in front of\nPascal, and in a voice which betokened more indignation than sorrow, he\nexclaimed: “This is a terrible mistake, gentlemen. Pascal Ferailleur\nis my friend; and his past vouches for his present. Go to the Palais de\nJustice, and make inquiries respecting his character there. They will\ntell you how utterly impossible it is that this man can be guilty of the\nignoble act he is accused of.”\n\nNo one made any reply. In the opinion of all his listeners, Ferdinand\nwas simply fulfilling a duty which it would have been difficult for\nhim to escape. The old gentleman who had decided the suspension and\nthe resumption of the game, gave audible expression to the prevailing\nsentiment of the party. He was a portly man, who puffed like a porpoise\nwhen he talked, and whom his companions called the baron. “Your words do\nyou honor--really do you honor,” he said, addressing Ferdinand--“and no\npossible blame can attach to you. That your friend is not an honest\nman is no fault of yours. There is no outward sign to distinguish\nscoundrels.”\n\nPascal had so far not opened his lips. After struggling for a moment in\nthe hands of his captors, he now stood perfectly motionless, glancing\nfuriously around him as if hoping to discover the coward who had\nprepared the trap into which he had fallen. For he felt certain that he\nwas the victim of some atrocious conspiracy, though it was impossible\nfor him to divine what motive had actuated his enemies. Suddenly those\nwho were holding him felt him tremble. He raised his head; he fancied\nhe could detect a ray of hope. “Shall I be allowed to speak in my own\ndefence?” he asked.\n\n“Speak!”\n\nHe tried to free himself; but those beside him would not relax their\nhold, so he desisted, and then, in a voice husky with emotion, he\nexclaimed: “I am innocent! I am the victim of an infamous plot. Who\nthe author of it is I do not know. But there is some one here who must\nknow.” Angry exclamations and sneering laughs interrupted him. “Would\nyou condemn me unheard?” he resumed, raising his voice. “Listen to me.\nAbout an hour ago, while you were at supper, Madame d’Argeles almost\nthrew herself at my feet as she entreated me to leave this house. Her\nagitation astonished me. Now I understand it.”\n\nThe gentleman known as the baron turned toward Madame d’Argeles: “Is\nwhat this man says true?”\n\nShe was greatly agitated, but she answered: “Yes.”\n\n“Why were you so anxious for him to go?”\n\n“I don’t know--a presentiment--it seemed to me that something was going\nto happen.”\n\nThe least observant of the party could not fail to notice Madame\nd’Argeles’s hesitation and confusion; but even the shrewdest were\ndeceived. They supposed that she had seen the act committed, and had\ntried to induce the culprit to make his escape, in order to avoid a\nscandal.\n\nPascal saw he could expect no assistance from this source. “M. de\nCoralth could assure you,” he began.\n\n“Oh, enough of that,” interrupted a player. “I myself heard M. de\nCoralth do his best to persuade you not to play.”\n\nSo the unfortunate fellow’s last and only hope had vanished. Still he\nmade a supreme effort, and addressing Madame d’Argeles: “Madame,” he\nsaid, in a voice trembling with anguish? “I entreat you, tell what you\nknow. Will you allow an honorable man to be ruined before your very\neyes? Will you abandon an innocent man whom you could save by a single\nword?” But she remained silent; and Pascal staggered as if some one had\ndealt him a terrible blow. “It is all over!” he muttered.\n\nNo one heard him; everybody was listening to the baron, who seemed to\nbe very much put out. “We are wasting precious time with all this,” said\nhe. “We should have made at least five rounds while this absurd scene\nhas been going on. We must put an end to it. What are you going to do\nwith this fellow? I am in favor of sending for a commissary of police.”\n\nSuch was not at all the opinion of the majority of the guests. Four\nor five of the ladies took flight at the bare suggestion and several\nmen--the most aristocratic of the company--became angry at once. “Are\nyou mad?” said one of them. “Do you want to see us all summoned as\nwitnesses? You have probably forgotten that Garcia affair, and that\nrumpus at Jenny Fancy’s house. A fine thing it would be to see, no one\nknows how many great names mixed up with those of sharpers and notorious\nwomen!”\n\nNaturally of a florid complexion, the baron’s face now became scarlet.\n“So it’s fear of scandal that deters you! Zounds, sir! a man’s courage\nshould equal his vices. Look at me.”\n\nCelebrated for his income of eight hundred thousand francs a year, for\nhis estates in Burgundy, for his passion for gaming, his horses, and his\ncook, the baron wielded a mighty influence. Still, on this occasion he\ndid not carry the day, for it was decided that the “sharper” should\nbe allowed to depart unmolested. “Make him at least return the money,”\n growled a loser; “compel him to disgorge.”\n\n“His winnings are there upon the table.”\n\n“Don’t believe it,” cried the baron. “All these scoundrels have secret\npockets in which they stow away their plunder. Search him by all means.”\n\n“That’s it--search him!”\n\nCrushed by this unexpected, undeserved and incomprehensible misfortune,\nPascal had almost yielded to his fate. But the shameful cry: “Search\nhim!” kindled terrible wrath in his brain. He shook off his assailants\nas a lion shakes off the hounds that have attacked him, and, reaching\nthe fireplace with a single bound, he snatched up a heavy bronze\ncandelabrum and brandished it in the air, crying: “The first who\napproaches is a dead man!”\n\nHe was ready to strike, there was no doubt about it; and such a weapon\nin the hands of a determined man, becomes positively terrible. The\ndanger seemed so great and so certain that his enemies paused--each\nencouraging his neighbor with his glance; but no one was inclined to\nengage in this struggle, by which the victor would merely gain a\nfew bank-notes. “Stand back, and allow me to retire?” said Pascal,\nimperiously. They still hesitated; but finally made way. And, formidable\nin his indignation and audacity, he reached the door of the room\nunmolested, and disappeared.\n\nThis superb outburst of outraged honor, this marvellous\nenergy--succeeding, as it did, the most complete mental prostration--and\nthese terrible threats, had proved so prompt and awe-inspiring that\nno one had thought of cutting off Pascal’s retreat. The guests had\nnot recovered from their stupor, but were still standing silent and\nintimidated when they heard the outer door close after him.\n\nIt was a woman who at last broke the spell. “Ah, well!” she exclaimed,\nin a tone of intense admiration, “that handsome fellow is level-headed!”\n\n“He naturally desired to save his plunder!”\n\nIt was the same expression that M. de Coralth had employed; and which\nhad, perhaps, prevented Pascal from yielding to Madame d’Argeles’s\nentreaties. Everybody applauded the sentiment--everybody, the baron\nexcepted. This rich man, whose passions had dragged him into the vilest\ndens of Europe, was thoroughly acquainted with sharpers and scoundrels\nof every type, from those who ride in their carriages down to the\nbare-footed vagabond. He knew the thief who grovels at his victim’s\nfeet, humbly confessing his crime, the desperate knave who swallows the\nnotes he has stolen, the abject wretch who bares his back to receive the\nblows he deserves, and the rascal who boldly confronts his accusers and\nprotests his innocence with the indignation of an honest man. But never,\nin any of these scoundrels, had the baron seen the proud, steadfast\nglance with which this man had awed his accusers.\n\nWith this thought uppermost in his mind he drew the person who had\nseized Pascal’s hands at the card-table a little aside. “Tell me,” said\nhe, “did you actually see that young man slip the cards into the pack?”\n\n“No, not exactly. But you know what we agreed at supper? We were sure\nthat he was cheating; and it was necessary to find some pretext for\ncounting the cards.”\n\n“What if he shouldn’t be guilty, after all?”\n\n“Who else could be guilty then? He was the only winner.”\n\nTo this terrible argument--the same which had silenced Pascal--the baron\nmade no reply. Indeed his intervention became necessary elsewhere, for\nthe other guests were beginning to talk loudly and excitedly around the\npile of gold and bank-notes which Pascal had left on the table. They\nhad counted it, and found it to amount to the sum of thirty-six thousand\nthree hundred and twenty francs; and it was the question of dividing it\nproperly among the losers which was causing all this uproar. Among these\nguests, who belonged to the highest society--among these judges who had\nso summarily convicted an innocent man, and suggested the searching of\na supposed sharper only a moment before--there were several who\nunblushingly misrepresented their losses. This was undeniable; for on\nadding the various amounts that were claimed together a grand total of\nninety-one thousand francs was reached. Had this man who had just fled\ntaken the difference between the two sums away with him? A difference\namounting almost to fifty-five thousand francs? No, this was impossible;\nthe supposition could not be entertained for a moment. However, the\ndiscussion might have taken an unfortunate turn, had it not been for the\nbaron. In all matters relating to cards, his word was law. He quietly\nsaid, “It is all right;” and they submitted.\n\nNevertheless, he absolutely refused to take his share of the money; and\nafter the division, rubbing his hands as if he were delighted to see\nthis disagreeable affair concluded, he exclaimed: “It is only six\no’clock; we have still time for a few rounds.”\n\nBut the other guests, pale, disturbed, and secretly ashamed of\nthemselves, were eager to depart, and in fact they were already\nhastening to the cloak-room. “At least play a game of ecarte,” cried the\nbaron, “a simple game of ecarte, at twenty louis a point.”\n\nBut no one listened, and he reluctantly prepared to follow his departing\nfriends, who bowed to Madame d’Argeles on the landing, as they filed by,\nM. de Coralth, who was among the last to retire, had already reached\nthe staircase, and descended two or three steps, when Madame d’Argeles\ncalled to him. “Remain,” said she; “I want to speak with you.”\n\n“You will excuse me,” he began; “I----”\n\nBut she again bade him “remain” in such an imperious tone that he dared\nnot resist. He reascended the stairs, very much after the manner of a\nman who is being dragged into a dentist’s office, and followed Madame\nd’Argeles into a small boudoir at the end of the gambling-room. As soon\nas the door was closed and locked, the mistress of the house turned to\nher prisoner. “Now you will explain,” said she. “It was you who brought\nM. Pascal Ferailleur here.”\n\n“Alas! I know only too well that I ought to beg your forgiveness.\nHowever, this affair will cost me dear myself. It has already embroiled\nme in a difficulty with that fool of a Rochecote, with whom I shall have\nto fight in less than a couple of hours.”\n\n“Where did you make his acquaintance?”\n\n“Whose--Rochecote’s?”\n\nMadame d’Argeles’s sempiternal smile had altogether disappeared. “I am\nspeaking seriously,” said she, with a threatening ring in her voice.\n“How did you happen to become acquainted with M. Ferailleur?”\n\n“That can be very easily explained. Seven or eight months ago I had need\nof an advocate’s services, and he was recommended to me. He managed my\ncase very cleverly, and we kept up the acquaintance.”\n\n“What is his position?”\n\nM. de Coralth’s features wore an expression of exceeding weariness as if\nhe greatly longed to go to sleep. He had indeed installed himself in a\nlarge arm-chair, in a semi-recumbent position. “Upon my word, I\ndon’t know,” he replied. “Pascal had always seemed to be the most\nirreproachable man in the world--a man you might call a philosopher! He\nlives in a retired part of the city, near the Pantheon, with his mother,\nwho is a widow, a very respectable woman, always dressed in black. When\nshe opened the door for me, on the occasion of my first visit, I thought\nsome old family portrait had stepped down from its frame to receive\nme. I judge them to be in comfortable circumstances. Pascal has the\nreputation of being a remarkable man, and people supposed he would rise\nvery high in his profession.”\n\n“But now he is ruined; his career is finished.”\n\n“Certainly! You can be quite sure that by this evening all Paris will\nknow what occurred here last night.”\n\nHe paused, meeting Madame Argeles’s look of withering scorn with a\ncleverly assumed air of astonishment. “You are a villain! Monsieur de\nCoralth,” she said, indignantly.\n\n“I--and why?”\n\n“Because it was you who slipped those cards, which made M. Ferailleur\nwin, into the pack; I saw you do it! And yielding to my entreaties,\nthe young fellow was about to leave the house when you, intentionally,\nprevented him from saving himself. Oh! don’t deny it.”\n\nM. de Coralth rose in the coolest possible manner. “I deny nothing, my\ndear lady,” he replied, “absolutely nothing. You and I understand each\nother.”\n\nConfounded by his unblushing impudence, Madame d’Argeles remained\nspeechless for a moment. “You confess it!” she cried, at last. “You dare\nto confess it! Were you not afraid that I might speak and state what I\nhad seen?”\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “No one would have believed you,” he\nexclaimed.\n\n“Yes, I should have been believed, Monsieur de Coralth, for I could have\ngiven proofs. You must have forgotten that I know you, that your past\nlife is no secret to me, that I know who you are, and what dishonored\nname you hide beneath your borrowed title! I could have told my guests\nthat you are married--that you have abandoned your wife and child,\nleaving them to perish in want and misery--I could have told them where\nyou obtain the thirty or forty thousand francs you spend each year. You\nmust have forgotten that Rose told me everything, Monsieur--Paul!”\n\nShe had struck the right place this time, and with such precision that\nM. de Coralth turned livid, and made a furious gesture, as if he were\nabout to fell her to the ground. “Ah, take care!” he exclaimed; “take\ncare!”\n\nBut his rage speedily subsided, and with his usual indifferent manner,\nand in a bantering tone, he said: “Well, what of that? Do you fancy that\nthe world doesn’t already suspect what you could reveal? People have\nsuspected me of being even worse than I am. When you proclaim on the\nhousetops that I am an adventurer, folks will only laugh at you, and I\nshall be none the worse for it. A matter that would crush a dozen men\nlike Pascal Ferailleur would not injure me in the least. I am accustomed\nto it. I must have luxury and enjoyment, everything that is pleasant and\nbeautiful--and to procure all this, I do my very best. It is true that\nI don’t derive my income from my estate in Brie; but I have plenty of\nmoney, and that is the essential thing. Besides, it is so difficult to\nearn a livelihood nowadays, and the love of luxury is so intense that\nno one knows at night what he may do--or, rather, what he won’t do--the\nnext day. And last, but not least, the people who ought to be despised\nare so numerous that contempt is an impossibility. A Parisian who\nhappened to be so absurdly pretentious as to refuse to shake hands with\nsuch of his acquaintances as were not irreproachable characters, might\nwalk for hours on the Boulevards without finding an occasion to take his\nhands out of his pockets.”\n\nM. de Coralth talked well enough, and yet, in point of fact, all this\nwas sheer bravado on his part. He knew better than any one else, on what\na frail and uncertain basis his brilliant existence was established.\nCertainly, society does show great indulgence to people of doubtful\nreputation. It shuts its eyes and refuses to look or listen. But this is\nall the more reason why it should be pitiless when a person’s guilt is\npositively established. Thus, although he assumed an air of insolent\nsecurity, the “viscount” anxiously watched the effect of his words upon\nMadame d’Argeles. Fortunately for himself, he saw that she was abashed\nby his cynicism; and so he resumed: “Besides, as our friend, the baron,\nwould say, we are wasting precious time in discussing improbable, and\neven impossible, suppositions. I was sufficiently well acquainted with\nyour heart and your intelligence, my dear madame, to be sure that you\nwould not speak a word to my disparagement.”\n\n“Indeed! What prevented me from doing so?”\n\n“I did; or perhaps I ought rather to say, your own good sense, which\nclosed your mouth when Monsieur Pascal entreated you to speak in his\ndefence. I am entitled to considerable indulgence, madame, and a great\ndeal ought to be forgiven me. My mother, unfortunately, was an honest\nwoman, who did not furnish me with the means of gratifying every whim.”\n\nMadame d’Argeles recoiled as if a serpent had suddenly crossed her path.\n\n“What do you mean?” she faltered.\n\n“You know as well as I do.”\n\n“I don’t understand you--explain yourself.”\n\nWith the impatient gesture of a man who finds himself compelled\nto answer an idle question, and assuming an air of hypocritical\ncommiseration, he replied: “Well, since you insist upon it, I know,\nin Paris--in the Rue de Helder, to be more exact--a nice young fellow,\nwhose lot I have often envied. He has wanted for nothing since the day\nhe came into the world. At school, he had three times as much money\nas his richest playfellow. When his studies were finished, a tutor was\nprovided--with his pockets full of gold--to conduct this favored youth\nto Italy, Egypt, and Greece. He is now studying law; and four times\na year, with unvarying punctuality, he receives a letter from London\ncontaining five thousand francs. This is all the more remarkable, as\nthis young man has neither a father nor a mother. He is alone in the\nworld with his income of twenty thousand francs. I have heard him say,\njestingly, that some good fairy must be watching over him; but I know\nthat he believes himself to be the illegitimate son of some great\nEnglish nobleman. Sometimes, when he has drunk a little too much, he\ntalks of going in search of my lord, his father.”\n\nThe effect M. de Coralth had created by these words must have been\nextremely gratifying to him, for Madame d’Argeles had fallen back in her\nchair, almost fainting. “So, my dear madame,” he continued, “if I ever\nhad any reason to fancy that you intended causing me any trouble, I\nshould go to this charming youth and say: ‘My good fellow, you are\nstrangely deceived. Your money doesn’t come from the treasure-box of an\nEnglish peer, but from a small gambling den with which I am very well\nacquainted, having often had occasion to swell its revenues with my\nfranc-pieces.’ And if he mourned his vanished dreams, I should tell\nhim: ‘You are wrong; for, if the great nobleman is lost, the good fairy\nremains. She is none other than your mother, a very worthy person, whose\nonly object in life is your comfort and advancement.’ And if he doubted\nmy word, I should bring him to his mother’s house some baccarat night;\nand there would be a scene of recognition worthy of Fargueil’s genius.”\n\nAny man but M. de Coralth would have had some compassion, for Madame\nd’Argeles was evidently suffering agony. “It is as I feared!” she\nmoaned, in a scarcely audible voice.\n\nHowever, he heard her. “What!” he exclaimed in a tone of intense\nastonishment; “did you really doubt it? No; I can’t believe it; it would\nbe doing injustice to your intelligence and experience. Are people like\nourselves obliged to talk in order to understand each other? Should I\never have ventured to do what I have done, in your house, if I had not\nknown the secret of your maternal tenderness, delicacy of feeling, and\ndevotion?”\n\nShe was weeping; big tears were rolling down her face, tracing a broad\nfurrow through the powder on her cheeks. “He knows everything!” she\nmurmured; “he knows everything!”\n\n“By the merest chance, I assure you. As I don’t like folks to meddle\nwith my affairs, I never meddle with theirs. As I have just said, it was\nentirely the work of chance. One April afternoon I came to invite you\nto a drive in the Bois. I was ushered into this very room where we\nare sitting now, and found you writing. I said I would wait until you\nfinished your letter; but some one called you, and you hastily left the\nroom. How it was that I happened to approach your writing-table I cannot\nexplain; but I did approach it, and read your unfinished letter. Upon my\nword it touched me deeply. I can give no better proof of the truth of my\nassertion than the fact that I can repeat it, almost word for word, even\nnow. ‘DEAR SIR,’--you wrote to your London correspondent--‘I send you\nthree thousand francs, in addition to the five thousand for the regular\nquarterly payment. Forward the money without delay. I fear the poor boy\nis greatly annoyed by his creditors. Yesterday I had the happiness\nof seeing him in the Rue de Helder, and I found him looking pale and\ncareworn. When you send him this money, forward at the same time a\nletter of fatherly advice. It is true, he ought to work and win an\nhonorable position for himself; but think of the dangers and temptation\nthat beset him, alone and friendless, in this corrupt city.’ There, my\ndear lady, your letter ended; but the name and address were given, and\nit was easy enough to understand it. You remember, perhaps, a little\nincident that occurred after your return. On perceiving that you had\nforgotten your letter, you turned pale and glanced at me. ‘Have you\nread it, and do you understand it?’ your eyes asked; while mine replied:\n‘Yes, but I shall be silent.’”\n\n“And I shall be silent too,” said Madame d’Argeles.\n\nM. de Coralth took her hand and raised it to his lips. “I knew we should\nunderstand each other,” he remarked, gravely. “I am not bad at heart,\nbelieve me; and if I had possessed money of my own, or a mother like\nyou----”\n\nShe averted her face, fearing perhaps that M. de Coralth might read\nher opinion of him in her eyes; but after a short pause she exclaimed\nbeseechingly: “Now that I am your accomplice, let me entreat you to do\nall you possibly can to prevent last night’s affair from being noised\nabroad.”\n\n“Impossible.”\n\n“If not for M. Ferailleur’s sake, for the sake of his poor widowed\nmother.”\n\n“Pascal must be put out of the way!”\n\n“Why do you say that? Do you hate him so much then? What has he done to\nyou?”\n\n“To me, personally? Nothing--I even feel actual sympathy for him.”\n\nMadame d’Argeles was confounded. “What!” she stammered; “it wasn’t on\nyour own account that you did this?”\n\n“Why, no.”\n\nShe sprang to her feet, and quivering with scorn and indignation, cried:\n“Ah! then the deed is even more infamous--even more cowardly!” But\nalarmed by the threatening gleam in M. de Coralth’s eyes, she went no\nfurther.\n\n“A truce to these disagreeable truths,” said he, coldly. “If we\nexpressed our opinions of each other without reserve, in this world,\nwe should soon come to hard words. Do you think I acted for my own\npleasure? Suppose some one had seen me when I slipped the cards into the\npack. If that had happened, I should have been ruined.”\n\n“And you think that no one suspects you?”\n\n“No one. I lost more than a hundred louis myself. If Pascal belonged to\nour set, people might investigate the matter, perhaps; but to-morrow it\nwill be forgotten.”\n\n“And will he have no suspicions?”\n\n“He will have no proofs to offer, in any case.”\n\nMadame d’Argeles seemed to resign herself to the inevitable. “I hope you\nwill, at least, tell me on whose behalf you acted,” she remarked.\n\n“Impossible,” replied M. de Coralth. And, consulting his watch, he\nadded, “But I am forgetting myself; I am forgetting that that idiot of\na Rochecote is waiting for a sword-thrust. So go to sleep, my dear lady,\nand--till we meet again.”\n\nShe accompanied him so far as the landing. “It is quite certain that he\nis hastening to the house of M. Ferailleur’s enemy,” she thought. And,\ncalling her confidential servant, “Quick, Job,” she said; “follow M.\nde Coralth. I want to know where he is going. And, above all, take care\nthat he doesn’t see you.”\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nIf through the length and breadth of Paris there is a really quiet,\npeaceful street, a refuge for the thoughtfully inclined, it is surely\nthe broad Rue d’Ulm, which starts from the Place du Pantheon,\nand finishes abruptly at the Rue des Feuillantines. The shops are\nunassuming, and so few that one can easily count them. There is\na wine-shop on the left-hand side, at the corner of the Rue de la\nVieille-Estrapade; then a little toy-shop, then a washerwoman’s and then\na book-binder’s establishment; while on the right-hand you will find\nthe office of the Bulletin, with a locksmith’s, a fruiterer’s, and a\nbaker’s--that is all. Along the rest of the street run several spacious\nbuildings, somewhat austere in appearance, though some of them are\nsurrounded by large gardens. Here stands the Convent of the Sisters of\nthe Cross, with the House of Our Lady of Adoration; while further on,\nnear the Rue des Feuillantines, you find the Normal School, with the\noffice of the General Omnibus Company hard by. At day-time you mostly\nmeet grave and thoughtful faces in the street: priests, savants,\nprofessors, and clerks employed in the adjacent public libraries. The\nonly stir is round about the omnibus office; and if occasional bursts of\nlaughter are heard they are sure to come from the Normal School. After\nnightfall, a person might suppose himself to be at least a hundred\nleagues from the Boulevard Montmartre and the Opera-House, in some\nquiet old provincial town, at Poitiers, for instance. And it is only on\nlistening attentively that you can catch even a faint echo of the tumult\nof Paris.\n\nIt was in this street--“out of the world,” as M. de Coralth expressed\nit--that Pascal Ferailleur resided with his mother. They occupied a\nsecond floor, a pretty suite of five rooms, looking out upon a garden.\nTheir rent was high. Indeed, they paid fourteen hundred francs a year.\nBut this was a burden which Pascal’s profession imposed upon him; for\nhe, of course, required a private office and a little waiting-room for\nhis clients. With this exception, the mother and son led a straightened,\nsimple life. Their only servant was a woman who came at seven o’clock to\ndo the heavy work, went home again at twelve, and did not return again\nuntil the evening, to serve dinner. Madame Ferailleur attended to\neverything, not blushing in the least when she was compelled to open the\ndoor for some client. Besides, she could do this without the least risk\nof encountering disrespect, so imposing and dignified were her manners\nand her person.\n\nM. de Coralth had shown excellent judgment when he compared her to a\nfamily portrait. She was, in fact, exactly the person a painter would\nselect to represent some old burgher’s wife--a chaste and loving spouse,\na devoted mother, an incomparable housewife--in one phrase, the faithful\nguardian of her husband’s domestic happiness. She had just passed her\nfiftieth birthday, and looked fully her age. She had suffered. A close\nobserver would have detected traces of weeping about her wrinkled\neyelids; and the twinge of her lips was expressive of cruel anguish,\nheroically endured. Still, she was not severe, nor even too sedate; and\nthe few friends who visited her were often really astonished at her wit.\nBesides, she was one of those women who have no history, and who find\nhappiness in what others would call duty. Her life could be summed up in\na single sentence: she had loved; she had mourned.\n\nThe daughter of a petty clerk in one of the government departments, and\nmerely dowered with a modest portion of three thousand francs, she had\nmarried a young man as poor as herself, but intelligent and industrious,\nwhom she loved, and who adored her. This young man on marrying had sworn\nthat he would make a fortune; not that he cared for money for himself,\nbut he wished to provide his idol with every luxury. His love, enhancing\nhis energy, no doubt hastened his success. Attached as a chemist to\na large manufacturing establishment, his services soon became so\ninvaluable to his employers that they gave him a considerable interest\nin the business. His name even obtained an honorable place among modern\ninventors; and we are indebted to him for the discovery of one of those\nbrilliant colors that are extracted from common coal. At the end of ten\nyears he had become a man of means. He loved his wife as fondly as on\nthe day of their marriage, and he had a son--Pascal.\n\nUnfortunate fellow! One day, in the full sunshine of happiness and\nsuccess, while he was engaged in a series of experiments for the purpose\nof obtaining a durable, and at the same time perfectly harmless, green,\nthe chemicals exploded, smashing the mortar which he held, and wounding\nhim horribly about the head and chest. A fortnight later he died,\napparently calm, but in reality a prey to bitter regrets. It was a\nterrible blow for his poor wife, and the thought of her son alone\nreconciled her to life. Pascal was now everything to her--her present\nand her future; and she solemnly vowed that she would make a noble man\nof him. But alas! misfortunes never come singly. One of her husband’s\nfriends, who acted as administrator to the estate, took a contemptible\nadvantage of her inexperience. She went to sleep one night possessing\nan income of fifteen thousand francs, but she awoke to find herself\nruined--so completely ruined that she did not know where to obtain her\ndinner for that same evening. Had she been alone in the world, she would\nnot have grieved much over the catastrophe, but she was sadly affected\nby the thought that her son’s future was, perhaps, irrevocably blighted,\nand that, in any case, this disaster would condemn him to enter life\nthrough the cramped and gloomy portals of poverty.\n\nHowever, Madame Ferailleur was of too courageous and too proud a nature\nnot to meet this danger with virile energy. She wasted no time in\nuseless lamentations. She determined to repair the harm as far as it\nwas in her power to repair it, resolving that her son’s studies at the\ncollege of Louis-the-Great should not be interrupted, even if she had to\nlabor with her own hands. And when she spoke of manual toil, it was\nno wild, unmeaning exaggeration born of sorrow and a passing flash of\ncourage. She found employment as a day-servant and in sewing for\nlarge shops, until she at last obtained a situation as clerk in the\nestablishment where her husband had been a partner. To obtain this she\nwas obliged to acquire a knowledge of bookkeeping, but she was amply\nrepaid for her trouble; for the situation was worth eighteen hundred\nfrancs a year, besides food and lodging. Then only did her efforts\nmomentarily abate; she felt that her arduous task was drawing to a happy\nclose. Pascal’s expenses at school amounted to about nine hundred francs\na year; she did not spend more than one hundred on herself; and thus she\nwas able to save nearly eight hundred francs a year.\n\nIt must be admitted that she was admirably seconded in her efforts by\nher son. Pascal was only twelve years old when his mother said to him:\n“I have ruined you, my son. Nothing remains of the fortune which your\nfather accumulated by dint of toil and self-sacrifice. You will be\nobliged to rely upon yourself, my boy. God grant that in years to come\nyou will not reproach me for my imprudence.”\n\nThe child did not throw himself into her arms, but holding his head\nproudly erect, he answered: “I shall love you even more, dear mother,\nif that be possible. As for the fortune which my father left you, I will\nrestore it to you again. I am no longer a school-boy, I am a man--as you\nshall see.”\n\nOne could not fail to perceive that he had taken a solemn vow. Although\nhe possessed a remarkable mind, and the power of acquiring knowledge\nrapidly, he had, so far, worked indifferently, and then only by fits and\nstarts, whenever examination time drew near. But from that day forward\nhe did not lose a moment. His remarks, which were at once comical and\ntouching, were those of the head of a family, deeply impressed by a\nsense of his own responsibility. “You see,” he said to his companions,\nwho were astonished at his sudden thirst for knowledge, “I can’t afford\nto wear out my breeches on the college forms, now that my poor mother\nhas to pay for them with her work.”\n\nHis good-humor was not in the least impaired by his resolve not to spend\na single penny of his pocket money. With a tact unusual at his age, or\nindeed at any other, he bore his misfortunes simply and proudly, without\nany of the servile humility or sullen envy which so often accompanies\npoverty. For three years in succession the highest prizes at the\ncompetitions rewarded him for his efforts; but these successes, far from\nelating him unduly, seemed to afford him but little satisfaction.\n“This is only glory,” he thought; and his great ambition was to support\nhimself.\n\nHe was soon able to do so, thanks to the kindness of the head-master,\nwho offered him his tuition gratis if he would assist in superintending\nsome of the lower classes. Thus one day when Madame Ferailleur presented\nherself as usual to make her quarterly payment, the steward replied:\n“You owe us nothing, madame; everything has been paid by your son.”\n\nShe almost fainted; after bearing adversity so bravely, this happiness\nproved too much for her. She could scarcely believe it. A long\nexplanation was necessary to convince her of the truth, and then big\ntears, tears of joy this time, gushed from her eyes.\n\nIn this way, Pascal Ferailleur paid all the expenses of his education\nuntil he had won his degree, arming himself so as to resist the trials\nthat awaited him, and giving abundant proof of energy and ability.\nHe wished to be a lawyer; and the law, he was forced to admit, is a\nprofession which is almost beyond the reach of penniless young men. But\nthere are no insurmountable obstacles for those whose hearts are really\nset on an object. On the very day that Pascal inscribed his name as a\nstudent at the law school, he entered an advocate’s office as a clerk.\nHis duties, which were extremely tiresome at first, had the two-fold\nadvantage of familiarizing him with the forms of legal procedure, and of\nfurnishing him with the means of prosecuting his studies. After he had\nbeen in the office six months, his employer agreed to pay him eight\nhundred francs a year, which were increased to fifteen hundred at the\nend of the second twelvemonth. In three years, when he had passed his\nfinal examination qualifying him to practise, his patron raised him\nto the position of head-clerk, with a salary of three thousand francs,\nwhich Pascal was moreover able to increase considerably by drawing up\ndocuments for busy attorneys, and assisting them in the preparation of\ntheir least important cases.\n\nIt was certainly something wonderful to have achieved such a result in\nso short a time; but the most difficult part of his task had still to\nbe accomplished. It was a perilous undertaking to abandon an assured\nposition, to cast a certainty aside for the chances of life at the bar.\nIt was a grave step--so grave, indeed, that Pascal hesitated for a\nlong time. He was threatened with the danger that always threatens\nsubordinates who are useful to their superiors. He felt that his\nemployer, who was in the habit of relieving himself of his heaviest\nduties by intrusting them to him, would not be likely to forgive him\nfor leaving. And on starting on his own account, he could ill afford to\ndispense with this lawyer’s good-will. The patronage that could scarcely\nfail to follow him from an office where he had served for four years\nwas the most substantial basis of his calculations for the future.\nEventually he succeeded to his satisfaction, though not without some\ndifficulty, and only by employing that supreme finesse which consists in\nabsolute frankness.\n\nBefore his office had been open a fortnight, he had seven or eight\nbriefs waiting their turn upon his desk, and his first efforts were\nsuch as win the approving smile of old judges, and draw from them the\nprediction: “That young man will rise in his profession.” He had not\ndesired to make any display of his knowledge or talent, but merely to\nwin the cases confided to him; and, unlike many beginners, he evinced\nno inclination to shine at his clients’ expense. Rare modesty, and it\nserved him well. His first ten months of practice brought him about\neight thousand francs, absorbed in part by the expense attaching to a\nsuitable office. The second year his fees increased by about one-half,\nand, feeling that his position was now assured, he insisted that his\nmother should resign her clerkship. He proved to her what was indeed\nthe truth--that by superintending his establishment, she would save more\nthan she made in her present position.\n\nFrom that time the mother and the son had good reason to believe that\ntheir heroic energy had conquered fate. Clients became so numerous that\nPascal found it necessary to draw nearer the business centre, and\nhis rent was consequently doubled; but the income he derived from his\nprofession increased so rapidly that he soon had twelve thousand francs\nsafely invested as a resource against any emergency. Madame Ferailleur\nnow laid aside the mourning she had worn since her husband’s death. She\nfelt that she owed it to Pascal; and, besides, after believing there was\nno more happiness left for her on earth, her heart rejoiced at her son’s\nsuccess.\n\nPascal was thus on the high-road to fame, when a complication in M.\nFerdinand de Coralth’s affair, brought that young nobleman to his\noffice. The trouble arose from a little stock exchange operation\nwhich M. Ferdinand had engaged in--an affair which savored a trifle\nof knavery. It was strange, but Pascal rather took a liking to M. de\nCoralth. The honest worker felt interested in this dashing adventurer;\nhe was almost dazzled by his brilliant vices, his wit, his hardihood,\nconceit, marvellous assurance, and careless impudence; and he studied\nthis specimen of the Parisian flora with no little curiosity. M.\nde Coralth certainly did not confide the secret of his life and his\nresources to Pascal but the latter’s intelligence should have told him\nto distrust a man who treated the requirements of morality even more\nthan cavalierly, and who had infinitely more wants than scruples.\nHowever, the young advocate seemed to have no suspicions; they exchanged\nvisits occasionally, and it was Pascal himself who one day requested the\nviscount to take him to one of those “Reunions in High Life” which the\nnewspapers describe in such glowing terms.\n\nMadame Ferailleur was playing a game of whist with a party of old\nfriends, according to her custom every Thursday evening, when M. de\nCoralth called to invite the young advocate to accompany him to Madame\nd’Argeles’s reception. Pascal considered his friend’s invitation\nexceedingly well timed. He dressed himself with more than ordinary care,\nand, as usual before going out, he approached his mother to kiss her and\nwish her good-bye. “How fine you are!” she said, smiling.\n\n“I am going to a soiree, my dear mother,” he replied; “and it is\nprobable that I shall not return until very late. So don’t wait for me,\nI beg of you; promise me to go to bed at your usual hour.”\n\n“Have you the night-key?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Very well, then; I will not wait for you. When you come in you will\nfind your candle and some matches on the buffet in the ante-room. And\nwrap yourself up well, for it is very cold.” Then raising her forehead\nto her son’s lips, she gayly added: “A pleasant evening to you, my boy!”\n\nFaithful to her promise, Madame Ferailleur retired at the usual hour;\nbut she could not sleep. She certainly had no cause for anxiety, and\nyet the thought that her son was not at home filled her heart with\nvague misgivings such as she had never previously felt under similar\ncircumstances. Possibly it was because she did not know where Pascal was\ngoing. Possibly M. de Coralth was the cause of her strange disquietude,\nfor she utterly disliked the viscount. Her woman’s instinct warned her\nthat there was something unwholesome about this young man’s peculiar\nhandsomeness, and that it was not safe to trust to his professions of\nfriendship. At all events, she lay awake and heard the clock of the\nneighboring Normal School strike each successive hour--two, three, and\nfour. “How late Pascal stays,” she said to herself.\n\nAnd suddenly a fear more poignant even than her presentiments darted\nthrough her mind. She sprang out of bed and rushed to the window. She\nfancied she had heard a terrible cry of distress in the deserted street.\nAt that very moment, the insulting word “thief” was being hurled in her\nson’s face. But the street was silent, and deciding that she had been\nmistaken, she went back to bed laughing at herself for her fears; and\nat last she fell asleep. But judge of her terror in the morning when, on\nrising to let the servant in, she saw Pascal’s candle still standing on\nthe buffet. Was it possible that he had not returned? She hastened to\nhis room--he was not there. And it was nearly eight o’clock.\n\nThis was the first time that Pascal had spent a night from home without\nwarning his mother in advance; and such an act on the part of a man\nof his character was sufficient proof that something extraordinary\nhad occurred. In an instant all the dangers that lurk in Paris after\nnightfall flashed through her mind. She remembered all the stories she\nhad read of men decoyed into dark corners, of men stabbed at the turn of\nsome deserted street, or thrown into the Seine while crossing one of\nthe bridges. What should she do? Her first impulse was to run to the\nCommissary of Police’s office or to the house of Pascal’s friend; but\non the other hand, she dared not go out, for fear he might return in her\nabsence. Thus, in an agony of suspense, she waited--counting the seconds\nby the quick throbbings of her temples, and straining her ears to catch\nthe slightest sound.\n\nAt last, about half-past eight o’clock, she heard a heavy, uncertain\nfootfall on the stairs. She flew to the door and beheld her son. His\nclothes were torn and disordered; his cravat was missing, he wore no\novercoat, and he was bareheaded. He looked very pale, and his teeth were\nchattering. His eyes stared vacantly, and his features had an almost\nidiotic expression. “Pascal, what has happened to you?” she asked.\n\nHe trembled from head to foot as the sound of her voice suddenly roused\nhim from his stupor. “Nothing,” he stammered; “nothing at all.” And as\nhis mother pressed him with questions, he pushed her gently aside and\nwent on to his room.\n\n“Poor child!” murmured Madame Ferailleur, at once grieved and reassured;\n“and he is always so temperate. Some one must have forced him to drink.”\n\nShe was entirely wrong in her surmise, and yet Pascal’s sensations were\nexactly like those of an intoxicated man. How he had returned home, by\nwhat road, and what had happened on the way, he could not tell. He had\nfound his way back mechanically, merely by force of habit--physical\nmemory, as it might be called. He had a vague impression, however, that\nhe had sat down for some time on a bench in the Champs-Elysees, that he\nhad felt extremely cold, and that he had been accosted by a policeman,\nwho threatened him with arrest if he did not move on. The last thing he\ncould clearly recollect was rushing from Madame d’Argeles’s house in\nthe Rue de Berry. He knew that he had descended the staircase slowly\nand deliberately; that the servants in the vestibule had stood aside to\nallow him to pass; and that, while crossing the courtyard, he had thrown\naway the candelabrum with which he had defended himself. After that,\nhe remembered nothing distinctly. On reaching the street he had been\novercome by the fresh air, just as a carouser is overcome on emerging\nfrom a heated dining-room. Perhaps the champagne which he had drank had\ncontributed to this cerebral disorder. At all events, even now, in\nhis own room, seated in his own arm-chair, and surrounded by familiar\nobjects, he did not succeed in regaining the possession of his\nfaculties.\n\nHe had barely strength enough to throw himself on to the bed, and in\na moment he was sleeping with that heavy slumber which so often\nseizes hold of one on the occasion of a great crisis, and which has so\nfrequently been observed among persons condemned to death, on the night\npreceding their execution. Four or five times his mother came to listen\nat the door. Once she entered, and seeing her son sleeping soundly, she\ncould not repress a smile of satisfaction. “Poor Pascal!” she thought;\n“he can bear no excess but excess of work. Heavens! how surprised and\nmortified he will be when he awakes!”\n\nAlas! it was not a trifling mortification, but despair, which awaited\nthe sleeper on his wakening; for the past, the present, and the future\nwere presented simultaneously and visionlike to his imagination.\nAlthough he had scarcely regained the full use of his faculties, he was,\nto some extent, at least capable of reflection and deliberation, and he\ntried to look the situation bravely in the face. First, as to the past,\nhe had not the shadow of a doubt. He realized that he had fallen into a\nvile trap, and the person who had laid it for him was undoubtedly M. de\nCoralth, who, seated at his right, had prepared the “hands” with which\nhe had won. This was evident. It seemed equally proven that Madame\nd’Argeles knew the real culprit--possibly she had detected him in the\nact, possibly he had taken her into his confidence. But what he could\nnot fathom was M. de Coralth’s motive. What could have prompted the\nviscount to commit such an atrocious act? The incentive must have been\nvery powerful, since he had naturally incurred the danger of detection\nand of being considered an accomplice at the least. And then what\ninfluence had closed Madame d’Argeles’s lips? But after all, what\nwas the use of these conjectures? It was an actual, unanswerable, and\nterrible fact that this infamous plot had been successful, and\nthat Pascal was dishonored. He was honesty itself, and yet he was\naccused--more than that, CONVICTED--of cheating at cards! He was\ninnocent, and yet he could furnish no proofs of his innocence. He knew\nthe real culprit, and yet he could see no way of unmasking him or even\nof accusing him. Do what he would, this atrocious, incomprehensive\ncalumny would crush him. The bar was closed against him; his career was\nended. And the terrible conviction that there was no escape from the\nabyss into which he had fallen made his reason totter--he felt that he\nwas incapable of deciding on the best course, and that he must have a\nfriend’s advice.\n\nFull of this idea, he hastily changed his clothes, and hurried from\nhis room. His mother was watching for him--inclined to laugh at him\na little; but a single glance warned her that her son was in terrible\ntrouble, and that some dire misfortune had certainly befallen him.\n“Pascal, in heaven’s name, what has happened?” she cried.\n\n“A slight difficulty--a mere trifle,” he replied.\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“To the Palais de Justice.” And such was really the case, for he hoped\nto meet his most intimate friend there.\n\nContrary to his usual custom, he took the little staircase on the right,\nleading to the grand vestibule, where several lawyers were assembled,\nearnestly engaged in conversation. They were evidently astonished to\nsee Pascal, and their conversation abruptly ceased on his approach.\nThey assumed a grave look and turned away their heads in disgust. The\nunfortunate man at once realized the truth, and pressed his hand to\nhis forehead, with a despairing gesture, as he murmured:\n“Already!--already!”\n\nHowever, he passed on, and not seeing his friend, he hurried to the\nlittle conference hall, where he found five of his fellow-advocates. On\nPascal’s entrance, two of them at once left the hall, while two of the\nothers pretended to be very busily engaged in examining a brief which\nlay open on the table. The fifth, who did not move, was not the friend\nPascal sought, but an old college comrade named Dartelle. Pascal walked\nstraight toward him. “Well?” he asked.\n\nDartelle handed him a Figaro, still damp from the printing-press, but\ncrumpled and worn, as if it had already passed through more than a\nhundred hands. “Read!” said he.\n\nPascal read as follows: “There was great sensation and a terrible\nscandal last night at the residence of Madame d’A----, a well-known star\nof the first magnitude. A score of gentlemen of high rank and immense\nwealth were enjoying a quiet game of baccarat, when it was observed that\nM. F---- was winning in a most extraordinary manner. He was watched and\ndetected in the very act of dexterously slipping some cards into the\npack he held. Crushed by the overpowering evidence against him, he\nallowed himself to be searched, and without much demur consented to\nrefund the fruit of his knavery, to the amount of two thousand louis.\nThe strangest thing connected with this scandal is, that M. F----, who\nis an advocate by profession, has always enjoyed an enviable reputation\nfor integrity; and, unfortunately, this prank cannot be attributed to a\nmomentary fit of madness, for the fact that he had provided himself with\nthese cards in advance proves the act to have been premeditated. One of\nthe persons present was especially displeased. This was the Viscount de\nC----, who had introduced M. F---- to Madame d’A----. Extremely annoyed\nby this contretemps, he took umbrage at an offensive remark made by M.\nde R----, and it was rumored that these gentlemen would cross swords at\ndaybreak this morning.\n\n“LATER INTELLIGENCE.--We learn at the moment of going to press that an\nencounter has just taken place between M. de R---- and M. de C----.\nM. de R---- received a slight wound in the side, but his condition is\nsufficiently satisfactory not to alarm his friends.”\n\n\nThe paper slipped from Pascal’s hand. His features were almost\nunrecognizable in his passion and despair. “It is an infamous lie!”\n he said, hoarsely. “I am innocent; I swear it upon my honor!” Dartelle\naverted his face, but not quickly enough to prevent Pascal from noticing\nthe look of withering scorn in his eyes. Then, feeling that he was\ncondemned, that his sentence was irrevocable, and that there was no\nlonger any hope: “I know the only thing that remains for me to do!” he\nmurmured.\n\nDartelle turned, his eyes glistening with tears. He seized Pascal’s\nhands and pressed them with sorrowful tenderness, as if taking leave of\na friend who is about to die. “Courage!” he whispered.\n\nPascal fled like a madman. “Yes,” he repeated, as he rushed along the\nBoulevard Saint-Michel, “that is the only thing left me to do.”\n\nWhen he reached home he entered his office, double-locked the door, and\nwrote two letters--one to his mother, the other to the president of the\norder of Advocates. After a moment’s thought he began a third, but tore\nit into pieces before he had completed it. Then, without an instant’s\nhesitation, and like a man who had fully decided upon his course, he\ntook a revolver and a box of cartridges from a drawer in his desk. “Poor\nmother!” he murmured; “it will kill her--but my disgrace would kill her\ntoo. Better shorten the agony.”\n\nHe little fancied at that supreme moment that each of his gestures, each\ncontraction of his features, were viewed by the mother whose name he\nfaltered. Since her son had left her to go to the Palais de Justice, the\npoor woman had remained almost crazy with anxiety; and when she heard\nhim return and lock himself in his office--a thing he had never done\nbefore--a fearful presentiment was aroused in her mind. Gliding into her\nson’s bedroom, she at once approached the door communicating with his\noffice. The upper part of this portal was of glass; it was possible to\nsee what was occurring in the adjoining room. When Madame Ferailleur\nperceived Pascal seat himself at his desk and begin to write, she felt\na trifle reassured, and almost thought of going away. But a vague dread,\nstronger than reason or will, riveted her to the spot. A few moments\nlater, when she saw the revolver in her son’s hand, she understood\neverything. Her blood froze in her veins; and yet she had sufficient\nself-control to repress the cry of terror which sprang to her lips. She\nrealized that the danger was terrible, imminent, extreme. Her heart,\nrather than her bewildered reason, told her that her son’s life hung on\na single thread. The slightest sound, a word, a rap on the door might\nhasten the unfortunate man’s deed.\n\nAn inspiration from heaven came to the poor mother. Pascal had contented\nhimself with locking the door leading to the ante-room. He had forgotten\nthis one, or neglected it, not thinking that anybody would approach\nhis office through his bedroom. But his mother perceived that this door\nopened toward her. So, turning the knob with the utmost caution, she\nflung it suddenly open, and reaching her son’s side with a single bound,\nshe clasped him closely in her arms. “Pascal, wretched boy! what would\nyou do?”\n\nHe was so surprised that his weapon fell from his hand, and he sank\nback almost fainting in his arm-chair. The idea of denying his intention\nnever once occurred to him; besides, he was unable to articulate a word.\nBut on his desk there lay a letter addressed to his mother which would\nspeak for him.\n\nMadame Ferailleur took it, tore the envelope open, and read: “Forgive\nme--I’m about to die. It must be so. I cannot survive dishonor; and I am\ndishonored.”\n\n“Dishonored!--you!” exclaimed the heartbroken mother. “My God! what does\nthis mean? Speak. I implore you: tell me all--you must. I command you to\ndo so. I command you!”\n\nHe complied with this at once supplicating and imperious behest, and\nrelated in a despairing voice the events which had wrought his woe. He\ndid not omit a single particular, but tried rather to exaggerate than\npalliate the horrors of his situation. Perhaps he found a strange\nsatisfaction in proving to himself that there was no hope left; possibly\nhe believed his mother would say: “Yes, you are right; and death is your\nonly refuge!”\n\nAs Madame Ferailleur listened, however, her eyes dilated with fear and\nhorror, and she scarcely realized whether she were awake or in the\nmidst of some frightful dream. For this was one of those unexpected\ncatastrophes which are beyond the range of human foresight or even\nimagination, and which her mind could scarcely conceive or admit. But\nSHE did not doubt him, even though his friends had doubted him. Indeed,\nif he had himself told her that he was guilty of cheating at cards,\nshe would have refused to believe him. When his story was ended,\nshe exclaimed: “And you wished to kill yourself? Did you not think,\nsenseless boy, that your death would give an appearance of truth to this\nvile calumny?”\n\nWith a mother’s wonderful, sublime instinct, she had found the most\npowerful reason that could be urged to induce Pascal to live. “Did you\nnot feel, my son, that it showed a lack of courage on your part to brand\nyourself and your name with eternal infamy, in order to escape your\npresent sufferings? This thought ought to have stayed your hand. An\nhonest name is a sacred trust which no one has a right to abuse. Your\nfather bequeathed it to you, pure and untarnished, and so you must\npreserve it. If others try to cover it with opprobrium, you must live to\ndefend it.”\n\nHe lowered his head despondently, and in a tone of profound\ndiscouragement, he replied: “But what can I do? How can I escape from\nthe web which has been woven around me with such fiendish cunning? If I\nhad possessed my usual presence of mind at the moment of the accusation,\nI might have defended and justified myself, perhaps. But now the\nmisfortune is irreparable. How can I unmask the traitor, and what proofs\nof his guilt can I cast in his face?”\n\n“All the same, you ought not to yield without a struggle,” interrupted\nMadame Ferailleur, sternly. “It is wrong to abandon a task because it is\ndifficult; it must be accepted, and, even if one perish in the struggle,\nthere is, at least, the satisfaction of feeling that one has not failed\nin duty.”\n\n“But, mother----”\n\n“I must not keep the truth from you, Pascal! What! are you lacking in\nenergy? Come, my son, rise and raise your head. I shall not let you\nfight alone. I will fight with you.”\n\nWithout speaking a word, Pascal caught hold of his mother’s hands and\npressed them to his lips. His face was wet with tears. His overstrained\nnerves relaxed under the soothing influence of maternal tenderness and\ndevotion. Reason, too, had regained her ascendency. His mother’s noble\nwords found an echo in his own heart, and he now looked upon suicide as\nan act of madness and cowardice. Madame Ferailleur felt that the victory\nwas assured, but this did not suffice; she wished to enlist Pascal in\nher plans. “It is evident,” she resumed, “that M. de Coralth is the\nauthor of this abominable plot. But what could have been his object? Has\nhe any reason to fear you, Pascal? Has he confided to you, or have you\ndiscovered, any secret that might ruin him if it were divulged?”\n\n“No, mother.”\n\n“Then he must be the vile instrument of some even more despicable being.\nReflect, my son. Have you wounded any of your friends? Are you sure that\nyou are in nobody’s way? Consider carefully. Your profession has its\ndangers; and those who adopt it must expect to make bitter enemies.”\n\nPascal trembled. It seemed to him as if a ray of light at last illumined\nthe darkness--a dim and uncertain ray, it is true, but still a gleam of\nlight.\n\n“Who knows!” he muttered; “who knows!”\n\nMadame Ferailleur reflected a few moments, and the nature of her\nreflections brought a flush to her brow. “This is one of those cases\nin which a mother should overstep reserve,” said she. “If you had a\nmistress, my son----”\n\n“I have none,” he answered, promptly. Then his own face flushed, and\nafter an instant’s hesitation, he added: “But I entertain the most\nprofound and reverent love for a young girl, the most beautiful and\nchaste being on earth--a girl who, in intelligence and heart, is worthy\nof you, my own mother.”\n\nMadame Ferailleur nodded her head gravely, as much as to say that she\nhad expected to find a woman at the bottom of the mystery. “And who is\nthis young girl?” she inquired. “What is her name?”\n\n“Marguerite.”\n\n“Marguerite who?”\n\nPascal’s embarrassment increased. “She has no other name,” he replied,\nhurriedly, “and she does not know her parents. She formerly lived in our\nstreet with her companion, Madame Leon, and an old female servant. It\nwas there that I saw her for the first time. She now lives in the house\nof the Count de Chalusse, in the Rue de Courcelles.”\n\n“In what capacity?”\n\n“The count has always taken care of her--she owes her education to him.\nHe acts as her guardian; and although she has never spoken to me on the\nsubject, I fancy that the Count de Chalusse is her father.”\n\n“And does this girl love you, Pascal?”\n\n“I believe so, mother. She has promised me that she will have no other\nhusband than myself.”\n\n“And the count?”\n\n“He doesn’t know--he doesn’t even suspect anything about it. Day after\nday I have been trying to gather courage to tell you everything, and to\nask you to go to the Count de Chalusse. But my position is so modest as\nyet. The count is immensely rich, and he intends to give Marguerite an\nenormous fortune--two millions, I believe----”\n\nMadame Ferailleur interrupted him with a gesture. “Look no further,” she\nsaid; “you have found the explanation.”\n\nPascal sprang to his feet with crimson cheeks, flaming eyes, and\nquivering lips. “It may be so,” he exclaimed; “it may be so! The count’s\nimmense fortune may have tempted some miserable scoundrel. Who knows but\nsome one may have been watching Marguerite, and have discovered that I\nam an obstacle?”\n\n“Something told me that my suspicions were correct,” said Madame\nFerailleur. “I had no proofs, and yet I felt sure of it.”\n\nPascal was absorbed in thought. “And what a strange coincidence,” he\neventually remarked. “Do you know, the last time I saw Marguerite,\na week ago, she seemed so sad and anxious that I felt alarmed. I\nquestioned her, but at first she would not answer. After a little\nwhile, however, as I insisted, she said: ‘Ah, well, I fear the count is\nplanning a marriage for me. M. de Chalusse has not said a word to me on\nthe subject, but he has recently had several long conferences in private\nwith a young man whose father rendered him a great service in former\nyears. And this young man, whenever I meet him, looks at me in such a\npeculiar manner.’”\n\n“What is his name?” asked Madame Ferailleur.\n\n“I don’t know--she didn’t mention it; and her words so disturbed me\nthat I did not think of asking. But she will tell me. This evening, if\nI don’t succeed in obtaining an interview, I will write to her. If your\nsuspicions are correct, mother, our secret is in the hands of three\npersons, and so it is a secret no longer----”\n\nHe paused suddenly to listen. The noise of a spirited altercation\nbetween the servant and some visitor, came from the ante-room. “I tell\nyou that he IS at home,” said some one in a panting voice, “and I must\nsee him and speak with him at once. It is such an urgent matter that I\nleft a card-party just at the most critical moment to come here.”\n\n“I assure you, monsieur, that M. Ferailleur has gone out.”\n\n“Very well; I will wait for him, then. Take me to a room where I can sit\ndown.”\n\nPascal turned pale, for he recognized the voice of the individual who\nhad suggested searching him at Madame d’Argeles’s house. Nevertheless,\nhe opened the door; and a man, with a face like a full moon, and who was\npuffing and panting like a locomotive, came forward with the assurance\nof a person who thinks he may do anything he chooses by reason of his\nwealth. “Zounds!” he exclaimed. “I knew perfectly well that you\nwere here. You don’t recognize me, perhaps, my dear sir. I am Baron\nTrigault--I came to----”\n\nThe words died away on his lips, and he became as embarrassed as if he\nhad not possessed an income of eight hundred thousand francs a year. The\nfact is he had just perceived Madame Ferailleur. He bowed to her, and\nthen, with a significant glance at Pascal he said: “I should like to\nspeak to you in private, monsieur, in reference to a matter--”\n\nGreat as was Pascal’s astonishment, he showed none of it on his face.\n“You can speak in my mother’s presence,” he replied, coldly; “she knows\neverything.”\n\nThe baron’s surprise found vent in a positive distortion of his\nfeatures. “Ah!” said he, in three different tones; “ah! ah!” And as\nno one had offered him a seat, he approached an arm-chair and took\npossession of it, exclaiming, “You will allow me, I trust? Those stairs\nhave put me in such a state!”\n\nIn spite of his unwieldy appearance, this wealthy man was endowed with\ngreat natural shrewdness and an unusually active mind. And while he\npretended to be engaged in recovering his breath he studied the room\nand its occupants. A revolver was lying on the floor beside a torn and\ncrumpled letter, and tears were still glittering in the eyes of Madame\nFerailleur and her son. A keen observer needed no further explanation of\nthe scene.\n\n“I will not conceal from you, monsieur,” began the baron, “that I\nhave been led here by certain compunctions of conscience.” And,\nmisinterpreting a gesture which Pascal made, “I mean what I say,” he\ncontinued; “compunctions of conscience. I have them occasionally. Your\ndeparture this morning, after that deplorable scene, caused certain\ndoubts and suspicions to arise in my mind; and I said to myself, ‘We\nhave been too hasty; perhaps this young man may not be guilty.’”\n\n“Monsieur!” interrupted Pascal, in a threatening tone.\n\n“Excuse me, allow me to finish, if you please. Reflection, I must\nconfess, only confirmed this impression, and increased my doubts. ‘The\ndevil!’ I said to myself again; ‘if this young man is innocent, the\nculprit must be one of the habitues of Madame d’Argeles’s house--that is\nto say, a man with whom I play twice a week, and whom I shall play with\nagain next Monday.’ And then I became uneasy, and here I am!” Was the\nabsurd reason which the baron gave for his visit the true one? It was\ndifficult to decide. “I came,” he continued, “thinking that a look at\nyour home would teach me something; and now I have seen it, I am ready\nto take my oath that you are the victim of a vile conspiracy.”\n\nSo saying he noisily blew his nose, but this did not prevent him from\nobserving the quiet joy of Pascal and his mother. They were amazed. But\nalthough these words were calculated to make them feel intensely happy,\nthey still looked at their visitor with distrust. It is not natural for\na person to interest himself in other people’s misfortunes, unless he\nhas some special motive for doing so; and what could this singular man’s\nobject be?\n\nHowever, he did not seem in the slightest degree disconcerted by the\nglacial reserve with which his advances were received. “It is clear\nthat you are in some one’s way,” he resumed, “and that this some one has\ninvented this method of ruining you. There can be no question about it.\nThe intention became manifest to my mind the moment I read the paragraph\nconcerning you in the Figaro. Have you seen it? Yes? Well, what do you\nthink of it? I would be willing to swear that it was written from notes\nfurnished by your enemy. Moreover, the particulars are incorrect, and I\nam going to write a line of correction which I shall take to the office\nmyself.” So saying he transported his unwieldy person to Pascal’s desk,\nand hastily wrote as follows:\n\n\n   “MR. EDITOR,\n\n   “As a witness of the scene that took place at Madame d’A----s’s\n   house last night, allow me to make an important correction.  It is\n   only too true that extra cards were introduced into the pack, but\n   that they were introduced by M. F---- is not proven, since he was\n   NOT SEEN to do it.  I know that appearances are against him, but\n   he nevertheless possesses my entire confidence and esteem.\n\n                                   “BARON TRIGAULT.”\n\n\nMeanwhile Madame Ferailleur and her son had exchanged significant\nglances. Their impressions were the same. This man could not be an\nenemy. When the baron had finished his letter, and had read it aloud,\nPascal, who was deeply moved, exclaimed: “I do not know how to express\nmy gratitude to you, monsieur; but if you really wish to serve me, pray\ndon’t send that note. It would cause you a great deal of trouble and\nannoyance, and I should none the less be obliged to relinquish the\npractice of my profession--besides, I am especially anxious to be\nforgotten for a time.”\n\n“So be it--I understand you; you hope to discover the traitor, and you\ndo not wish to put him on his guard. I approve of your prudence. But\nremember my words: if you ever need a helping hand, rap at my door; and\nwhen you hold the necessary proofs, I will furnish you with the means of\nrendering your justification even more startling than the affront.” He\nprepared to go, but before crossing the threshold, he turned and said:\n“In future I shall watch the fingers of the player who sits on my left\nhand. And if I were in your place, I would obtain the notes from which\nthat newspaper article was written. One never knows the benefit that may\nbe derived, at a certain moment, from a page of writing.”\n\nAs he started off, Madame Ferailleur sprang from her chair. “Pascal,”\n she exclaimed, “that man knows something, and your enemies are his; I\nread it in his eyes. He, too, distrusts M. de Coralth.”\n\n“I understood him, mother, and my mind is made up. I must disappear.\nFrom this moment Pascal Ferailleur no longer exists.”\n\n\n\nThat same evening two large vans were standing outside Madame\nFerailleur’s house. She had sold her furniture without reserve, and was\nstarting to join her son, who had already left for Le Havre, she said,\nin view of sailing to America.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\n“There are a number of patients waiting for me. I will drop in again\nabout midnight. I still have several urgent visits to make.” Thus had\nDr. Jodon spoken to Mademoiselle Marguerite; and yet, when he left the\nHotel de Chalusse, after assuring himself that Casimir would have some\nstraw spread over the street, the doctor quietly walked home. The visits\nhe had spoken of merely existed in his imagination; but it was a part of\nhis role to appear to be overrun with patients. To tell the truth,\nthe only patient he had had to attend to that week was a superannuated\nporter, living in the Rue de la Pepiniere, and whom he visited twice a\nday, for want of something better to do. The remainder of his time\nwas spent in waiting for patients who never came, and in cursing the\nprofession of medicine, which was ruined, he declared, by excessive\ncompetition, combined with certain rules of decorum which hampered young\npractitioners beyond endurance.\n\nHowever, if Dr. Jodon had devoted one-half of the time he spent in\ncursing and building castles in the air to study, he might have,\nperhaps, raised his little skill to the height of his immense ambition.\nBut neither work nor patience formed any part of his system. He was\na man of the present age, and wished to rise speedily with as little\ntrouble as possible. A certain amount of display and assurance, a little\nluck, and a good deal of advertising would, in his opinion, suffice to\nbring about this result. It was with this conviction, indeed, that he\nhad taken up his abode in the Rue de Courcelles, situated in one of the\nmost aristocratic quarters of Paris. But so far, events had shown his\ntheory to be incorrect. In spite of the greatest economy, very cleverly\nconcealed, he had seen the little capital which constituted his entire\nfortune dwindle away. He had originally possessed but twenty thousand\nfrancs, a sum which in no wise corresponded with his lofty pretensions.\nHe had paid his rent that very morning; and he could not close his eyes\nto the fact that the time was near at hand when he would be unable to\npay it. What should he do then? When he thought of this contingency,\nand it was a subject that filled his mind to the exclusion of all other\nmatters, he felt the fires of wrath and hatred kindle in his soul. He\nutterly refused to regard himself as the cause of his own misfortunes;\non the contrary, following the example of many other disappointed\nindividuals, he railed at mankind and everything in general--at\ncircumstances, envious acquaintances, and enemies, whom he certainly did\nnot possess.\n\nAt times he was capable of doing almost anything to gratify his lust for\ngold, for the privations which he had endured so long were like oil cast\nupon the flame of covetousness which was ever burning in his breast. In\ncalmer moments he asked himself at what other door he could knock,\nin view of hastening the arrival of Fortune. Sometimes he thought of\nturning dentist, or of trying to find some capitalist who would join him\nin manufacturing one of those patent medicines which are warranted\nto yield their promoters a hundred thousand francs a year. On other\noccasions he dreamed of establishing a monster pharmacy, or of opening\na private hospital. But money was needed to carry out any one of these\nplans, and he had no money. There was the rub. However the time was fast\napproaching when he must decide upon his course; he could not possibly\nhold out much longer.\n\nHis third year of practice in the Rue de Courcelles had not yielded him\nenough to pay his servant’s wages. For he had a servant, of course.\nHe had a valet for the same reason as he had a suite of rooms of a\nsuperficially sumptuous aspect. Faithful to his system, or, rather, to\nhis master’s system, he had sacrificed everything to show. The display\nof gilding in his apartments was such as to make a man of taste shut\nhis eyes to escape the sight of it. There were gorgeous carpets and\nhangings, frescoed ceilings, spurious objects of virtu, and pier-tables\nloaded with ornaments. An unsophisticated youth from the country would\ncertainly have been dazzled; but it would not do to examine these things\ntoo closely. There was more cotton than silk in the velvet covering of\nthe furniture; and if various statuettes placed on brackets at a certain\nheight had been closely inspected, it would have been found that they\nwere of mere plaster, hidden beneath a coating of green paint, sprinkled\nwith copper filings. This plaster, playing the part of bronze, was in\nperfect keeping with the man, his system, and the present age.\n\nWhen the doctor reached home, his first question to his servant was as\nusual: “Has any one called?”\n\n“No one.”\n\nThe doctor sighed, and passing through his superb waiting-room, he\nentered his consulting sanctum, and seated himself in the chimney corner\nbeside an infinitesimal fire. He was even more thoughtful than usual.\nThe scene which he had just witnessed at the Count de Chalusse’s house\nrecurred to his mind, and he turned it over and over again in his brain,\nstriving to find some way by which he might derive an advantage from the\nmystery. For he was more than ever convinced that there was a mystery.\nHe had been engrossed in these thoughts for some time, when his\nmeditations were disturbed by a ring at the bell. Who could be calling\nat this hour?\n\nThe question was answered by his servant, who appeared and informed\nhim that a lady, who was in a great hurry, was waiting in the\nreception-room. “Very well,” was his reply; “but it is best to let her\nwait a few moments.” For he had at least this merit: he never deviated\nfrom his system. Under no circumstances whatever would he have admitted\na patient immediately; he wished him to wait so that he might have an\nopportunity of reflecting on the advantages of consulting a physician\nwhose time was constantly occupied.\n\nHowever, when ten minutes or so had elapsed, he opened the door, and\na tall lady came quickly forward, throwing back the veil which had\nconcealed her face. She must have been over forty-five; and if she had\never been handsome, there was nothing to indicate it now. She had brown\nhair, thickly sprinkled with gray, but very coarse and abundant, and\ngrowing low over her forehead; her nose was broad and flat; her lips\nwere thick, and her eyes were dull and expressionless. However, her\nmanners were gentle and rather melancholy; and one would have judged her\nto be somewhat of a devotee. Still for the time being she seemed greatly\nagitated. She seated herself at the doctor’s invitation; and without\nwaiting for him to ask any questions: “I ought to tell you at once,\nmonsieur,” she began, “that I am the Count de Chalusse’s house-keeper.”\n\nIn spite of his self-control, the doctor bounded from his chair. “Madame\nLeon?” he asked, in a tone of intense surprise.\n\nShe bowed, compressing her thick lips. “I am known by that name--yes,\nmonsieur. But it is only my Christian name. The one I have a right to\nbear would not accord with my present position. Reverses of fortune are\nnot rare in these days; and were it not for the consoling influences of\nreligion, one would not have strength to endure them.”\n\nThe physician was greatly puzzled. “What can she want of me?” he\nthought.\n\nMeanwhile, she had resumed speaking: “I was much reduced in\ncircumstances--at the end of my resources, indeed--when M. de\nChalusse--a family friend--requested me to act as companion to a young\ngirl in whom he was interested--Mademoiselle Marguerite. I accepted the\nposition; and I thank God every day that I did so, for I feel a mother’s\naffection for this young girl, and she loves me as fondly as if she were\nmy own daughter.” In support of her assertion, she drew a handkerchief\nfrom her pocket, and succeeded in forcing a few tears to her eyes.\n“Under these circumstances, doctor,” she continued, “you cannot fail to\nunderstand that the interests of my dearly beloved Marguerite bring me\nto you. I was shut up in my own room when M. de Chalusse was brought\nhome, and I did not hear of his illness until after your departure.\nPerhaps you might say that I ought to have waited until your next visit;\nbut I had not sufficient patience to do so. One cannot submit without\na struggle to the torture of suspense, when the future of a beloved\ndaughter is at stake. So here I am.” She paused to take breath, and then\nadded, “I have come, monsieur, to ask you to tell me the exact truth\nrespecting the count’s condition.”\n\nThe doctor was expecting something very different, but nevertheless he\nreplied with all due gravity and self-possession. “It is my painful duty\nto tell you, madame, that there is scarcely any hope, and that I expect\na fatal termination within twenty-four hours, unless the patient should\nregain consciousness.”\n\nThe housekeeper turned pale. “Then all is lost,” she faltered, “all\nis lost!” And unable to articulate another word she rose to her feet,\nbowed, and abruptly left the room.\n\nBefore the grate, with his mouth half open, and his right arm extended\nin an interrupted gesture, the doctor stood speechless and disconcerted.\nIt was only when the outer door closed with a bang that he seemed\nrestored to consciousness. And as he heard the noise he sprang forward\nas if to recall his visitor. “Ah!” he exclaimed, with an oath, “the\nmiserable old woman was mocking me!” And urged on by a wild, irrational\nimpulse, he caught up his hat and darted out in pursuit. Madame Leon was\nconsiderably in advance of him, and was walking very quickly; still, by\nquickening his pace, he might have overtaken her. However, he did not\njoin her, for he scarcely knew what excuse to offer for such a strange\nproceeding; he contented himself by cautiously following her at a little\ndistance. Suddenly she stopped short. It was in front of a tobacconist’s\nshop, where there was a post-office letter-box. The shop was closed, but\nthe box was there with its little slit for letters to be dropped into\nit. Madame Leon evidently hesitated. She paused, as one always does\nbefore venturing upon a decisive act, from which there will be no\nreturn, whatever may be the consequences. An observer never remains\ntwenty minutes before a letter-box without witnessing this pantomime so\nexpressive of irresolution. At last, however, she shrugged her\nshoulders with a gesture which eloquently expressed the result of her\ndeliberations; and drawing a letter from her bosom, she dropped it into\nthe box, and then hastened on more quickly than before.\n\n“There is not the slightest doubt,” thought the doctor, “that letter had\nbeen prepared in advance, and whether it should be sent or not depended\non the answer I gave.”\n\nWe have already said that M. Jodon was not a wealthy man, and yet\nhe would willingly have given a hundred-franc note to have known the\ncontents of this letter, or even the name of the person to whom it was\naddressed. But his chase was almost ended. Madame Leon had reached the\nHotel de Chalusse, and now went in. Should he follow her? His curiosity\nwas torturing him to such a degree that he had an idea of doing so;\nand it required an heroic effort of will to resist the temptation\nsuccessfully. But a gleam of common sense warned him that this would\nbe a terrible blunder. Once already during the evening his conduct had\nattracted attention; and he began to realize that there was a better\nway of winning confidence than by intruding almost forcibly into other\npeople’s affairs. Accordingly he thoughtfully retraced his steps,\nfeeling intensely disgusted with himself. “What a fool I am!” he\ngrumbled. “If I had kept the old woman in suspense, instead of blurting\nout the truth, I might have learned the real object of her visit; for\nshe had an object. But what was it?”\n\nThe doctor spent the two hours that remained to him before making his\nsecond visit in trying to discover it. But, although nothing prevented\nhim from exploring the boundless fields of improbable possibilities, he\ncould think of nothing satisfactory. There was only one certain point,\nthat Madame Leon and Mademoiselle Marguerite were equally interested in\nthe question as to whether the count would regain consciousness or not.\nAs to their interests in the matter, the doctor felt confident that\nthey were not identical; he was persuaded that a secret enmity\nexisted between them, and that the housekeeper had visited him without\nMademoiselle Marguerite’s knowledge. For he was not deceived by Madame\nLeon, or by her pretended devotion to Mademoiselle Marguerite. Her\nmanner, her smooth words, her tone of pious resignation, and the\nallusion to the grand name she had the right to bear, were all\ncalculated to impose upon one; but she had been too much disconcerted\ntoward the last to remember her part. Dr. Jodon lacked the courage to\nreturn to his sumptuous rooms, and it was in a little cafe that he thus\nreflected upon the situation, while drinking some execrable beer brewed\nin Paris out of a glass manufactured in Bavaria.\n\nAt last midnight sounded--the hour had come. Still the doctor did not\nmove. Having been obliged to wait himself, he wished, in revenge, to\nmake the others wait, and it was not until the cafe closed that he again\nwalked up the Rue de Courcelles. Madame Leon had left the gate ajar, and\nthe doctor had no difficulty in making his way into the courtyard. As\nin the earlier part of the evening, the servants were assembled in the\nconcierge’s lodge; but the careless gayety which shone upon their faces\na few hours before had given place to evident anxiety respecting their\nfuture prospects. Through the windows of the lodge they could be seen\nstanding round the two choice spirits of the household, M. Bourigeau,\nthe concierge, and M. Casimir, the valet, who were engaged in earnest\nconversation. And if the doctor had listened, he would have heard\nsuch words as “wages,” and “legacies,” and “remuneration for faithful\nservice,” and “annuities” repeated over and over again.\n\nBut M. Jodon did not listen. Thinking he should find some servant\ninside, he entered the house. However, there was nobody to announce his\npresence; the door closed noiselessly behind him, the heavy carpet which\ncovered the marble steps stifled the sound of his footsteps, and he\nascended the first flight without seeing any one. The door opening into\nthe count’s room was open, the room itself being brilliantly lighted by\na large fire, and a lamp which stood on a corner of the mantel-shelf.\nInstinctively the doctor paused and looked in. There had been no change\nsince his first visit. The count was still lying motionless on his\npillows; his face was swollen, his eyelids were closed, but he still\nbreathed, as was shown by the regular movement of the covering over his\nchest. Madame Leon and Mademoiselle Marguerite were his only attendants.\nThe housekeeper, who sat back a little in the shade, was half reclining\nin an arm-chair with her hands clasped in her lap, her lips firmly\ncompressed, and her eyes fixed upon vacancy. Pale but calm, and more\nimposing and more beautiful than ever, Mademoiselle Marguerite was\nkneeling beside the bed, eagerly watching for some sign of renewed life\nand intelligence on the count’s face.\n\nA little ashamed of his indiscretion, the doctor retreated seven or\neight steps down the stairs, and then ascended them again, coughing\nslightly, so as to announce his approach. This time he was heard.\nfor Mademoiselle Marguerite came to the door to meet him. “Well?” he\ninquired.\n\n“Alas!”\n\nHe advanced toward the bed, but before he had time to examine his\npatient Mademoiselle Marguerite handed him a scrap of paper. “The\nphysician who usually attends M. de Chalusse has been here in your\nabsence, monsieur,” said she. “This is his prescription, and we have\nalready administered a few drops of the potion.”\n\nM. Jodon, who was expecting this blow, bowed coldly.\n\n“I must add,” continued Mademoiselle Marguerite, “that the doctor\napproved of all that had been done; and I beg you will unite your skill\nwith his in treating the case.”\n\nUnfortunately all the medical skill of the faculty would have availed\nnothing here. After another examination, Dr. Jodon declared that it\nwould be necessary to wait for the action of nature, but that he must\nbe informed of the slightest change in the sick man’s condition. “And I\nwill tell my servant to wake me at once if I am sent for,” he added.\n\nHe was already leaving the room, when Madame Leon barred his passage.\n“Isn’t it true, doctor, that one attentive person would suffice to watch\nover the count?” she asked.\n\n“Most assuredly,” he answered.\n\nThe housekeeper turned toward Mademoiselle Marguerite. “Ah, you see, my\ndear young lady,” she said, “what did I tell you? Listen to me; take a\nlittle rest. Watching is not suitable work for one of your age----”\n\n“It is useless to insist,” interrupted the young girl, resolutely. “I\nshall remain here. I shall watch over him myself.”\n\nThe housekeeper made no reply; but it seemed to the doctor that the two\nwomen exchanged singular glances. “The devil!” he muttered, as he took\nhis departure; “one might think that they distrusted each other!”\n\nPerhaps he was right; but at all events he had scarcely left the house\nbefore Madame Leon again urged her dear young lady to take a few\nhours’ rest. “What can you fear?” she insisted, in her wheedling voice.\n“Sha’n’t I be here? Do you suppose your old Leon capable of losing\nherself in sleep, when your future depends upon a word from that poor\nman lying there?”\n\n“Pray, cease.”\n\n“Ah, no! my dear young lady; my love for you compels me.”\n\n“Oh, enough!” interrupted Mademoiselle Marguerite; “enough, Leon!”\n\nHer tone was so determined that the housekeeper was compelled to yield;\nbut not without a deep sigh, not without an imploring glance to Heaven,\nas if calling upon Providence to witness the purity of her motives and\nthe usefulness of her praiseworthy efforts. “At least, my dear lady,\nwrap yourself up warmly. Shall I go and bring you your heavy travelling\nshawl?”\n\n“Thanks, my dear Leon--Annette will bring it.”\n\n“Then, pray, send for it. But we are not going to watch alone? What\nshould we do if we needed anything?”\n\n“I will call,” replied Marguerite.\n\nThis was unnecessary, for Dr. Jodon’s departure from the house had put\nan abrupt termination to the servants’ conference; and they were now\nassembled on the landing, anxious and breathless, and peering eagerly\ninto the sick-room.\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite went toward them. “Madame Leon and myself will\nremain with the count,” she said. “Annette”--this was the woman whom\nshe liked best of all the servants “Casimir and a footman will spend the\nnight in the little side salon. The others may retire.”\n\nHer orders were obeyed. Two o’clock sounded from the church-tower near\nby, and then the solemn and terrible silence was only broken by the\nhard breathing of the unconscious man and the implacable ticktack of the\nclock on the mantel-shelf, numbering the seconds which were left for\nhim to live. From the streets outside, not a sound reached this princely\nabode, which stood between a vast courtyard and a garden as large as a\npark. Moreover, the straw which had been spread over the paving-stones\neffectually deadened the rumble of the few vehicles that passed.\nEnveloped in a soft, warm shawl, Madame Leon had again taken possession\nof her arm-chair, and while she pretended to be reading a prayer-book,\nshe kept a close watch over her dear young lady, as if she were striving\nto discover her in-most thoughts. Mademoiselle Marguerite did not\nsuspect this affectionate espionage. Besides, what would it have\nmattered to her? She had rolled a low arm-chair near the bedside, seated\nherself in it, and her eyes were fixed upon M. de Chalusse. Two or three\ntimes she started violently, and once even she said to Madame Leon:\n“Come--come and see!”\n\nIt seemed to her that there was a faint change in the patient’s face;\nbut it was only a fancy--she had been deceived by the shadows that\nplayed about the room, caused by the capricious flame in the grate. The\nhours were creeping on, and the housekeeper, wearying at last of her\nfruitless watch, dropped asleep; her head fell forward on to her breast,\nher prayer-book slipped from her hands, and finally she began to snore.\nBut Mademoiselle Marguerite did not perceive this, absorbed as she was\nin thoughts which, by reason of their very profundity, had ceased to\nbe sorrowful. Perhaps she felt she was keeping a last vigil over her\nhappiness, and that with the final breath of this dying man all her\ngirlhood’s dreams and all her dearest hopes would take flight for\nevermore. Undoubtedly her thoughts flew to the man to whom she had\npromised her life--to Pascal, to the unfortunate fellow whose honor\nwas being stolen from him at that very moment, in a fashionable\ngaming-house.\n\nAbout five o’clock the air became so close that she felt a sudden\nfaintness, and opened the window to obtain a breath of fresh air. The\nnoise aroused Madame Leon from her slumbers. She rose, yawned, and\nrather sullenly declared that she felt very queer, and would certainly\nfall ill if she did not take some refreshment. It became necessary to\nsummon M. Casimir, who brought her a glass of Madeira and some biscuits.\n“Now I feel better,” she murmured, after her repast. “My excessive\nsensibility will be the death of me.” And so saying, she dropped asleep\nagain.\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite had meanwhile returned to her seat; but her\nthoughts gradually became confused, her eyelids grew heavy, and although\nshe struggled, she at last fell asleep in her turn, with her head\nresting on the count’s bed. It was daylight when a strange and terrible\nshock awoke her. It seemed to her as if an icy hand, some dead person’s\nhand, was gently stroking her head, and tenderly caressing her hair. She\nat once sprang to her feet. The sick man had regained consciousness;\nhis eyes were open and his right arm was moving. Mademoiselle Marguerite\ndarted to the bell-rope and pulled it violently, and as a servant\nappeared in answer to the summons, she cried: “Run for the physician who\nlives near here--quick!--and tell him that the count is conscious.”\n\nIn an instant, almost, the sick-room was full of servants, but the girl\ndid not perceive it. She had approached M. de Chalusse, and taking his\nhand, she tenderly asked: “You hear me, do you not, monsieur? Do you\nunderstand me?”\n\nHis lips moved; but only a hollow, rattling sound, which was absolutely\nunintelligible, came from his throat. Still, he understood her; as\nit was easy to see by his gestures--despairing and painful ones, for\nparalysis had not released its hold on its victim, and it was only with\ngreat difficulty that he could slightly move his right arm. He evidently\ndesired something. But what?\n\nThey mentioned the different articles in the room--everything indeed\nthat they could think of. But in vain, until the housekeeper suddenly\nexclaimed: “He wishes to write.”\n\nThat was, indeed, what he desired. With the hand that was comparatively\nfree, with the hoarse rattle that was his only voice, M. de Chalusse\nanswered, “Yes, yes!” and his eyes even turned to Madame Leon with an\nexpression of joy and gratitude. They raised him on his pillows, and\nbrought him a small writing-desk, with some paper, and a pen that\nhad been dipped in ink. But like those around him, he had himself\nover-estimated his strength; if he could move his hand, he could not\nCONTROL its movements. After a terrible effort and intense suffering,\nhowever, he succeeded in tracing a few words, the meaning of which it\nwas impossible to understand. It was only with the greatest\ndifficulty that these words could be deciphered--“My entire\nfortune--give--friends--against----” This signified nothing.\n\nIn despair, he dropped the pen, and his glance and his hand turned to\nthat part of the room opposite his bed. “Monsieur means his escritoire,\nperhaps?”\n\n“Yes, yes,” the sick man hoarsely answered.\n\n“Perhaps the count wishes that it should be opened?”\n\n“Yes, yes!” was the reply again.\n\n“My God!” exclaimed Mademoiselle Marguerite, with a gesture of despair;\n“what have I done? I have broken the key. I feared the responsibility\nwhich would fall upon us all.”\n\nThe expression of the count’s face had become absolutely frightful.\nIt indicated utter discouragement, the most bitter suffering, the most\nhorrible despair. His soul was writhing in a body from which life had\nfled. Intelligence, mind, and will were fast bound in a corpse which\nthey could not electrify. The consciousness of his own powerlessness\ncaused him a paroxysm of frantic rage; his hands clinched, the veins in\nhis throat swelled, his eyes almost started from their sockets, and in\na harsh, shrill voice that had nothing human in it, he exclaimed:\n“Marguerite!--despoiled!--take care!--your mother!” And this was all--it\nwas the supreme effort that broke the last link that bound the soul to\nearth.\n\n“A priest!” cried Madame Leon! “A priest! In the name of Heaven, go for\na priest!”\n\n“Rather for a notary,” suggested M. Casimir. “You see he wishes to make\na will.”\n\nBut at that moment the physician entered, pale and breathless. He walked\nstraight to the bedside, glanced at the motionless form, and solemnly\nexclaimed: “The Count de Chalusse is dead!”\n\nThere was a moment’s stupor--the stupor which always follows death,\nespecially when death comes suddenly and unexpectedly. A feeling of\nmingled wonder, selfishness, and fear pervaded the group of servants.\n“Yes, it is over!” muttered the doctor; “it is all over!”\n\nAnd as he was familiar with these painful scenes, and had lost none\nof his self-possession, he furtively studied Mademoiselle Marguerite’s\nfeatures and attitude. She seemed thunderstruck. With dry, fixed eyes\nand contracted features, she stood rooted to her place, gazing at the\nlifeless form as if she were expecting some miracle--as if she still\nhoped to hear those rigid lips reveal the secret which he had tried in\nvain to disclose, and which he had carried with him to the grave.\n\nThe physician was the only person who observed this. The other occupants\nof the room were exchanging looks of distress. Some of the women had\nfallen upon their knees, and were sobbing and praying in the same\nbreath. But Madame Leon’s sobs could be heard above the rest. They were\nat first inarticulate moans, but suddenly she sprang toward Mademoiselle\nMarguerite, and clasping her in her arms, she cried: “What a misfortune!\nMy dearest child, what a loss!” Utterly incapable of uttering a word,\nthe poor girl tried to free herself from this close embrace, but the\nhousekeeper would not be repulsed, and continued: “Weep, my dear young\nlady, weep! Do not refuse to give vent to your sorrow.”\n\nShe herself displayed so little self-control that the physician\nreprimanded her with considerable severity, whereat her emotion\nincreased, and with her handkerchief pressed to her eyes, she sobbed:\n“Yes, doctor, yes; you are right; I ought to moderate my grief. But\npray, doctor, remove my beloved Marguerite from this scene, which is too\nterrible for her young and tender heart. Persuade her to retire to her\nown room, so that she may ask God for strength to bear the misfortune\nwhich has befallen her.”\n\nThe poor girl had certainly no intention of leaving the room, but\nbefore she could say so, M. Casimir stepped forward. “I think,” he dryly\nobserved, “that mademoiselle had better remain here.”\n\n“Eh?” said Madame Leon, looking up suddenly. “And why, if you please?”\n\n“Because--because----”\n\nAnger had dried the housekeeper’s tears. “What do you mean?” she asked.\n“Do you pretend to prevent mademoiselle from doing as she chooses in her\nown house?”\n\nM. Casimir gave vent to a contemptuous whistle, which, twenty-four hours\nearlier, would have been punished with a heavy blow from the man who\nwas now lying there--dead. “Her own house!” he answered; “her own house!\nYesterday I shouldn’t have denied it; but to-day it’s quite another\nthing. Is she a relative? No, she isn’t. What are you talking about,\nthen? We are all equals here.”\n\nHe spoke so impudently that even the doctor felt indignant. “Scoundrel!”\n said he.\n\nBut the valet turned toward him with an air which proved that he was\nwell acquainted with the doctor’s servant, and, consequently, with all\nthe secrets of the master’s life. “Call your own valet a scoundrel, if\nyou choose,” he retorted, “but not me. Your duties here are over, aren’t\nthey? So leave us to manage our own affairs. Thank heaven, I know what\nI’m talking about. Everybody knows that caution must be exercised in a\ndead man’s house, especially when that house is full of money, and when,\ninstead of relatives, there are--persons who--who are there nobody knows\nhow or why. In case any valuables were missed, who would be accused\nof taking them? Why, the poor servants, of course. Ah, they have broad\nshoulders! Their trunks would be searched; and even if nothing were\nfound, they would be sent to prison all the same. In the meantime other\npeople would escape with the booty. No, Lisette! No one will stir from\nthis room until the arrival of the justice----”\n\nMadame Leon was bursting with rage. “All right!” she interrupted; “I’m\ngoing to send for the count’s particular friend, General----”\n\n“I don’t care a fig for your general.”\n\n“Wretch!”\n\nIt was Mademoiselle Marguerite who put an end to this indecent dispute.\nIts increasing violence had aroused her from her stupor. Casimir’s\nimpudence brought a flush to her forehead, and stepping forward with\nhaughty resolution, she exclaimed: “You forget that one never raises\none’s voice in the chamber of death.” Her words were so true, and her\nmanner so majestic, that M. Casimir was silenced. Then, pointing to the\ndoor, she coldly added: “Go for the justice of the peace, and don’t set\nfoot here again, except in his company.”\n\nHe bowed, stammered an unintelligible apology, and left the room. “She\nalways gets the best of me,” he growled, as he went downstairs. “But\nseals shall be put on everything.”\n\nWhen he entered the porter’s lodge, M. Bourigeau was just getting up,\nhaving slept all night, while his wife watched. “Quick,” ordered M.\nCasimir; “make haste and finish dressing, and run for the justice of the\npeace--we must have him here at once. Everything must be done regularly\nand in order, upstairs.”\n\nThe concierge was in despair. “Heavens!” he exclaimed; “so the master’s\ndead! What a misfortune!”\n\n“You may well say so; and this is the second time such a thing has\nhappened to me. I remember now what a shrewd fellow named Chupin once\nsaid to me. ‘If I were a servant,’ he remarked, ‘before entering a man’s\nservice, I’d make him insure his life for my benefit in one of those\nnew-fangled companies, so that I might step into a handsome fortune if\nhe took it into his head to die.’ But make haste, Bourigeau.”\n\n“That’s a famous idea, but scarcely practicable,” growled the concierge.\n\n“I don’t know whether it is or not. But at all events I’m terribly\nannoyed. The count was giving me enormous wages, and I had got him\nnicely into my ways. Well, after all, I shall only have to begin again!”\n\nM. Bourigeau had not yet attained to the heights of such serene\nphilosophy, and as he buttoned his overcoat, he groaned: “Ah! you’re not\nsituated as I am, Casimir. You’ve only yourself to look out for. I have\nmy furniture; and if I don’t succeed in finding a position where I can\nhave two rooms, I shall be obliged to sell part of it. What a blessed\nnuisance!”\n\nAs soon as he was dressed he started off on his mission; and M. Casimir,\nwho dared not return to the house, began walking slowly to and fro\nin front of the lodge. He had made some thirty turns or so, and was\nbeginning to feel impatient, when he saw Victor Chupin approaching. “You\nare always on hand at the right moment,” remarked M. Casimir. “It’s all\nover!”\n\nChupin turned eagerly. “Then our bargain holds?” he exclaimed. “You\nunderstand what I mean--the funeral, you know.”\n\n“It isn’t certain that I shall have anything to do with it; but call\nagain in three hours from now.”\n\n“All right, I’ll be here.”\n\n“And M. Fortunat?” asked Casimir.\n\n“He received what he called a ‘violent shock’ last evening, but he’s\nbetter this morning. He instructed me to tell you that he should look\nfor you between twelve and one--you know where.”\n\n“I’ll endeavor to be there, although it may be difficult for me to get\naway. If I go, however, I’ll show him the letter that caused the count’s\nillness; for the count threw it away, after tearing it into several\npieces, and I found some of the bits which escaped his notice as well as\nmademoiselle’s. It’s a strange letter, upon my word!”\n\nChupin gazed at the valet with a look of mingled wonder and admiration.\n“By Jove!” he exclaimed, “how fortunate a man must be to secure a valet\nlike you!”\n\nHis companion smiled complacently, but all of a sudden he remarked:\n“Make haste and go. I see Bourigeau in the distance, bringing the\njustice of the peace.”\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nThe magistrate who was now approaching the Chalusse mansion in the\nconcierge’s company, exemplified in a remarkable manner all the ideas\nthat are awakened in one’s mind by the grand yet simple title of\n“Justice of the Peace.” He was the very person you would like to think\nof as the family magistrate; as the promoter of friendly feeling; as the\nguardian of the rights of the absent, the young, and the weak; as the\njust arbiter in unfortunate differences between those who are closely\nrelated; a sage of wide experience and boundless benevolence; a judge\nwhose paternal justice dispenses with all pomp and display, and who\nis allowed by French statutes to hold his court by his own fireside,\nproviding the doors stand open. He was considerably over fifty,\ntall, and very thin, with bent shoulders. His clothes were rather\nold-fashioned in cut, but by no means ridiculous. The expression of his\nface was gentleness itself; but it would not have done to presume upon\nthis gentleness, for his glance was keen and piercing--like the glance\nof all who are expert in diving into consciences, and discovering the\nsecrets hidden there. Moreover, like all men who are accustomed to\ndeliberate in public, his features were expressionless. He could see and\nhear everything, suspect and understand everything, without letting a\nmuscle of his face move. And yet the habitues of his audience-chamber,\nand his clerks, pretended that they could always detect the nature of\nhis impressions. A ring which he wore upon one of his fingers served\nas a barometer for those who knew him. If a difficult case, or one that\nembarrassed his conscience, presented itself, his eyes fixed themselves\nobstinately upon this ring. If he were satisfied that everything was\nright, he looked up again, and began playing with the ring, slipping it\nup and down between the first and second joint of his finger; but if he\nwere displeased, he abruptly turned the bezel inside.\n\nIn appearance, he was sufficiently imposing to intimidate even M.\nCasimir. The proud valet bowed low as the magistrate approached, and\nwith his heart in his mouth, and in an obsequious voice he said: “It was\nI who took the liberty of sending for you, monsieur.”\n\n“Ah!” said the magistrate, who already knew as much about the Hotel\nde Chalusse, and the events of the past twelve hours, as M. Casimir\nhimself; for on his way to the house, he had turned Bourigeau inside out\nlike a glove, by means of a dozen gentle questions.\n\n“If monsieur wishes I will explain,” resumed M. Casimir.\n\n“Nothing! It is quite unnecessary. Usher us in.”\n\nThis “us” astonished the valet; but before they reached the house it\nwas explained to him. He discovered a man of flourishing and even jovial\nmien who was walking along in the magistrate’s shadow carrying a large\nblack portfolio under his arm. This was evidently the clerk. He seemed\nto be as pleased with his employment as he was with himself; and as\nhe followed M. Casimir, he examined the adornments of the mansion, the\nmosaics in the vestibule, the statuary and the frescoed walls with an\nappraiser’s eye. Perhaps he was calculating how many years’ salary it\nwould require to pay for the decorating of this one staircase.\n\nOn the threshold of the death room the magistrate paused. There had been\nsome change during M. Casimir’s absence. The doctor had left. The bed\nhad been rearranged, and several candles were burning on a table covered\nwith a white cloth. Madame Leon had gone to her own room, accompanied by\ntwo servants, to fetch a vessel of holy water and a branch of withered\npalm. She was now engaged in repeating the prayers for the dead, pausing\nfrom time to time to dip the palm branch in the holy water, and sprinkle\nthe bed. Both windows had been opened in spite of the cold. On the\nmarble hearth stood a chafing-dish full of embers from which rose spiral\nrings of smoke, filling the room with a pungent odor as a servant poured\nsome vinegar and sugar on to the coals.\n\nAs the magistrate appeared, every one rose up. Then, after bestowing\nprolonged scrutiny upon the room and its occupants, he respectfully\nremoved his hat, and walked in. “Why are so many people here?” he\ninquired.\n\n“I suggested that they should remain,” replied M. Casimir, “because--”\n\n“You are--suspicious,” interrupted the magistrate.\n\nHis clerk had already drawn a pen and some paper from his portfolio, and\nwas engaged in reading the decision, rendered by the magistrate at the\nrequest of one Bourigeau, and in virtue of which, seals were about to\nbe affixed to the deceased nobleman’s personal effects. Since the\nmagistrate had entered the room, his eyes had not once wandered from\nMademoiselle Marguerite, who was standing near the fireplace, looking\npale but composed. At last he approached her, and in a tone of deep\nsympathy: “Are you Mademoiselle Marguerite?” he asked.\n\nShe raised her clear eyes, rendered more beautiful than ever, by the\ntears that trembled on her lashes, and in a faltering voice, replied:\n“Yes, monsieur.”\n\n“Are you a relative? Are you connected in any way with the Count de\nChalusse? Have you any right to his property?”\n\n“No, monsieur.”\n\n“Excuse me, mademoiselle, but these questions are indispensable. Who\nintrusted you to the care of M. de Chalusse, and by what right? Was it\nyour father or your mother?”\n\n“I have neither father nor mother, monsieur. I am alone in the\nworld--utterly alone.”\n\nThe magistrate glanced keenly round the room. “Ah! I understand,” said\nhe, at last; “advantage has been taken of your isolation to treat you\nwith disrespect, to insult you, perhaps.”\n\nEvery head drooped, and M. Casimir bitterly regretted that he had not\nremained below in the courtyard. Mademoiselle Marguerite looked at the\nmagistrate in astonishment, for she was amazed by his penetration. She\nwas ignorant of his conversation with Bourigeau on the road, and did not\nknow that through the concierge’s ridiculous statements and accusations,\nthe magistrate had succeeded in discovering at least a portion of the\ntruth.\n\n“I shall have the honor of asking for a few moments’ conversation with\nyou presently, mademoiselle,” he said. “But first, one question. I am\ntold that the Count de Chalusse entertained a very lively affection for\nyou. Are you sure that he has not taken care to provide for your future?\nAre you sure that he has not left a will?”\n\nThe girl shook her head. “He made one in my favor some time ago,” she\nreplied. “I saw it; he gave it to me to read; but it was destroyed a\nfortnight after my arrival here, and in compliance with my request.”\n\nMadame Leon had hitherto been dumb with fear, but, conquering\nher weakness, she now decided to draw near and take part in the\nconversation. “How can you say that, my dear young lady?” she exclaimed.\n“You know that the count--God rest his soul!--was an extremely cautious\nman. I am certain that there is a will somewhere.”\n\nThe magistrate’s eyes were fixed on his ring. “It would be well to look,\nperhaps, before affixing the seals. You have a right to require this;\nso, if you wish----”\n\nBut she made no reply.\n\n“Oh, yes!” insisted Madame Leon; “pray look, monsieur.”\n\n“But where should we be likely to find a will?”\n\n“Certainly in this room--in this escritoire, or in one of the deceased\ncount’s cabinets.”\n\nThe magistrate had learnt the story of the key from Bourigeau, but all\nthe same he asked: “Where is the key to this escritoire?”\n\n“Alas! monsieur,” replied Mademoiselle Marguerite, “I broke it last\nnight when M. de Chalusse was brought home unconscious. I hoped to avert\nwhat has, nevertheless, happened. Besides, I knew that his escritoire\ncontained something over two millions in gold and bank-notes.”\n\nTwo millions--there! The occupants of the room stood aghast. Even\nthe clerk was so startled that he let a blot fall upon his paper. Two\nmillions! The magistrate was evidently reflecting. “Hum!” he murmured,\nmeditatively. Then, as if deciding on his course, he exclaimed:\n\n“Let a locksmith be sent for.”\n\nA servant went in search of one; and while they were waiting for his\nreturn, the magistrate sat down beside his clerk and talked to him in a\nlow voice. At last the locksmith appeared, with his bag of tools\nhanging over his shoulder, and set to work at once. He found his task\na difficult one. His pick-locks would not catch, and he was talking of\nfiling the bolt, when, by chance, he found the joint, and the door flew\nopen. But the escritoire was empty. There were only a few papers, and a\nbottle about three-quarters full of a crimson liquid on the shelf. Had\nM. de Chalusse rose and shook off his winding sheet, the consternation\nwould not have been greater. The same instinctive fear thrilled the\nhearts of everybody present. An enormous fortune had disappeared. The\nsame suspicions would rest upon them all. And each servant already saw\nhimself arrested, imprisoned, and dragged before a law court.\n\nHowever, anger speedily followed bewilderment, and a furious clamor\narose. “A robbery has been committed!” cried the servants, in concert.\n“Mademoiselle had the key. It is wrong to suspect the innocent!”\n\nRevolting as this exhibition was, it did not modify the magistrate’s\ncalmness. He had witnessed too many such scenes in the course of\nhis career, and, at least, a score of times he had been compelled to\ninterpose between children who had come to blows over their inheritance\nbefore their father’s body was even cold. “Silence!” he commanded\nsternly. And as the tumult did not cease, as the servants continued\nto cry, “The thief must be found. We shall have no difficulty in\ndiscovering the culprit,” the magistrate exclaimed, still more\nimperiously: “Another word, and you all leave the room.”\n\nThey were silenced; but there was a mute eloquence about their looks and\ngestures which it was impossible to misunderstand. Every eye was fixed\nupon Mademoiselle Marguerite with an almost ferocious expression. She\nknew it only too well; but, sublime in her energy, she stood, with her\nhead proudly erect, facing the storm, and disdaining to answer these\nvile imputations. However she had a protector near by--the magistrate in\nperson. “If this treasure has been diverted from the inheritance,” said\nhe, “the thief will be discovered and punished. But I wish to have one\npoint explained--who said that Mademoiselle Marguerite had the key of\nthe escritoire?”\n\n“I did,” replied a footman. “I was in the dining-room yesterday morning\nwhen the count gave it to her.”\n\n“For what purpose did he give it to her?”\n\n“That she might obtain this vial--I recognized it at once. She brought\nit down to him.”\n\n“Did she return the key?”\n\n“Yes; she gave it to him when she handed him the vial, and I saw him put\nit in his pocket.”\n\nThe magistrate pointed to the bottle which was standing on the shelf.\n“Then the count himself must have put the vial back in its place,” said\nhe. “Further comment is unnecessary; for, if the money had then been\nmissing, he could not have failed to discover the fact.” No one had\nany reply to make to this quiet defence, which was, at the same time,\na complete vindication. “And, besides,” continued the magistrate, “who\ntold you that this immense sum would be found here? Did you know it?\nWhich one of you knew it?” And as nobody still ventured any remark,\nhe added in an even more severe tone, and without seeming to notice\nMademoiselle Marguerite’s look of gratitude, “It is by no means a proof\nof honesty to be so extremely suspicious. Would it not have been easier\nto suppose that the deceased had placed the money somewhere else, and\nthat it will yet be found?”\n\nThe clerk had been even less disturbed than the magistrate. He also was\nblase, having witnessed too many of those frightful and shameless dramas\nwhich are enacted at a dead man’s bedside, to be surprised at anything.\nIf he had deigned to glance at the escritoire, it was only because\nhe was curious to see how small a space would suffice to contain two\nmillions; and then he had begun to calculate how many years he would\nbe obliged to remain a clerk before he could succeed in amassing such\na fabulous sum. However, hearing his superior express the intention\nof continuing the search for the will, and the missing treasure, he\nabruptly abandoned his calculation, and exclaimed, “Then, I suppose, I\ncan commence my report, monsieur?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the magistrate, “write as follows:” And in a monotonous\nvoice he began to dictate the prescribed formula, an unnecessary\nproceeding, for the clerk was quite as familiar with it as the\nmagistrate himself:--“On the 16th of October, 186-, at nine o’clock\nin the morning, in compliance with the request of the servants of the\ndeceased Louis-Henri-Raymond de Durtal, Count de Chalusse, and in the\ninterest of his presumptive heirs, and all others connected with him,\nand in accordance with the requirements of clauses 819 (Code Napoleon)\nand 909 (Code of Procedure), we, justice of the peace, accompanied by\nour clerk, visited the residence of the deceased aforesaid, in the\nRue de Courcelles, where, having entered a bedroom opening on to the\ncourtyard, and lighted by two windows looking toward the south, we found\nthe body of the deceased aforesaid, lying on his bed, and covered with a\nsheet. In this room were----” He paused in his dictation, and addressing\nthe clerk, “Take down the names of all present,” said he. “That will\nrequire some little time, and, meanwhile, I will continue my search.”\n\nThey had, in fact, only examined the shelf of the escritoire, and the\ndrawers were still to be inspected. In the first which he opened, the\nmagistrate found ample proofs of the accuracy of the information which\nhad been furnished him by Mademoiselle Marguerite. The drawer contained\na memorandum which established the fact that the Credit Foncier had lent\nM. de Chalusse the sum of eight hundred and fifty thousand francs, which\nhad been remitted to him on the Saturday preceding his death. Beside\nthis document lay a second memorandum, signed by a stockbroker named\nPell, setting forth that the latter had sold for the count securities of\nvarious descriptions to the amount of fourteen hundred and twenty-three\nthousand francs, which sum had been paid to the count on the preceding\nTuesday, partly in bank-notes and partly in gold. It was thus evident\nthat M. de Chalusse had received a grand total of two million two\nhundred and seventy-three thousand francs within the past six days.\n\nIn the drawer which was next opened, the magistrate only found a number\nof deeds, bonds, leases, and mortgages; but they proved that public\nrumor, far from exaggerating the figures of the count’s fortune,\nhad diminished it, and this made it difficult to explain why he had\ncontracted a loan. The third and last drawer contained twenty-eight\nthousand francs, in packages of twenty-franc pieces. Finally, in a small\ncasket, the magistrate found a packet of letters, yellow with age and\nbound together with a broad piece of blue velvet; as well as three or\nfour withered bouquets, and a woman’s glove, which had been worn by a\nhand of marvellous smallness. These were evidently the relics of some\ngreat passion of many years before; and the magistrate looked at them\nfor a moment with a sigh.\n\nHis own interest prevented him from noticing Mademoiselle Marguerite’s\nagitation. She had almost fainted on perceiving these souvenirs of the\ncount’s past life so suddenly exhumed. However, the examination of\nthe escritoire being over, and the clerk having completed his task of\nrecording the names of all the servants, the magistrate said, in a loud\nvoice, “I shall now proceed to affix the seals; but, before doing so, I\nshall take a portion of the money found in this desk, and set it apart\nfor the expenses of the household, in accordance with the law. Who will\ntake charge of this money?”\n\n“Oh, not I!” exclaimed Madame Leon.\n\n“I will take charge of it,” said M. Casimir.\n\n“Then here are eight thousand francs, for which you will be held\naccountable.”\n\nM. Casimir being a prudent man, counted the money himself, and after\ndoing so, “Who will attend to the count’s obsequies?” he inquired.\n\n“You, and without loss of time.”\n\nProud of his new importance, the valet hastily left the room, his\nself-complacency increased by the thought that he was to breakfast with\nM. Isidore Fortunat, and would afterward share a fat commission with\nVictor Chupin.\n\nHowever, the magistrate had already resumed his dictation: “And at this\nmoment we have affixed bands of white tape, sealed at either end with\nred wax, bearing the impress of our seal as justice of the peace, to\nwit: In the aforesaid chamber of the deceased: First, A band of tape,\ncovering the keyhole of the lock of the escritoire, which had been\npreviously opened by a locksmith summoned by us, and closed again by the\nsaid locksmith----” And so the magistrate and his clerk went from\none piece of furniture to another, duly specifying in the report each\ninstance in which the seals were affixed.\n\nFrom the count’s bedroom they passed into his study, followed by\nMademoiselle Marguerite, Madame Leon, and the servants. By noon every\narticle of furniture in which M. de Chalusse would have been likely\nto deposit his valuables or a will, had been searched, and nothing,\nabsolutely nothing, had been found. The magistrate had pursued his\ninvestigation with the feverish energy which the most self-possessed\nof men are apt to display under such circumstances, especially when\ninfluenced by the conviction that the object they are seeking is\nsomewhere within their reach, perhaps under their very hand. Indeed, he\nwas persuaded--he was sure--he would, in fact, have sworn that the Count\nde Chalusse had taken all the precautions natural in childless men,\nwho have no near relatives to inherit their fortune, or who have placed\ntheir interest and affections beyond their family circle. And when he\nwas obliged to abandon his search, his gesture indicated anger rather\nthan discouragement; for apparent evidence had not shaken his conviction\nin the least. So he stood motionless, with his eyes riveted on his ring,\nas if waiting some miraculous inspiration from it. “For the count’s\nonly fault, I am sure, was in being too cautious,” he muttered. “This is\nfrequently the case, and it would be quite in keeping with the character\nof this man, judging from what I know of him.”\n\nMadame Leon lifted her hands to heaven. “Ah, yes! such was, indeed, his\nnature,” she remarked, approvingly. “Never, no never, have I seen such\na suspicious and distrustful person as he was. Not in reference to\nmoney--no, indeed--for he left that lying about everywhere; but about\nhis papers. He locked them up with the greatest care, as if he feared\nthat some terrible secret might evaporate from them. It was a mania with\nhim. If he had a letter to write, he barricaded his door, as if he were\nabout to commit some horrible crime. More than once have I seen him----”\n The words died away on her lips, and she remained motionless and\nabashed, like a person who has just escaped some great peril. One\nword more, and involuntarily, without even knowing it, she would\nhave confessed her besetting sin, which was listening at, and peering\nthrough, the keyholes of the doors that were closed against her. Still,\nshe deluded herself with the belief that this slight indiscretion of her\noverready tongue had escaped the magistrate’s notice.\n\nHe certainly did not seem to be conscious of it, for he was giving\nhis attention entirely to Mademoiselle Marguerite, who seemed to have\nregained the cold reserve and melancholy resignation habitual to her.\n“You see, mademoiselle,” he remarked, “that I have done all that is\nin my power to do. We must now leave the search to chance, and to the\nperson who takes the inventory. Who knows what surprise may be in store\nfor us in this immense house, of which we have only explored three\nrooms?”\n\nShe shook her head gently and replied: “I can never be sufficiently\ngrateful for your kindness, monsieur, and for the great service you\nrendered me in crushing that infamous accusation. As regards the rest, I\nhave never expected anything--I do not expect anything now.”\n\nShe believed what she said, and her tone of voice proved this so\nunmistakably that the magistrate was surprised and somewhat disturbed.\n“Come, come, my young lady,” he said, with almost paternal kindness of\nmanner, “you ought not to despond. Still, you must have certain reasons\nfor speaking as you do; and as I am free for an hour, we are going to\nhave a plain talk, as if we were father and daughter.”\n\nOn hearing these words, the clerk rose with a cloud on his jovial\nface. He impatiently jingled his bunch of keys; for as the seals are\nsuccessively affixed, each key is confided to the clerk, to remain in\nhis hands until the seals are removed.\n\n“I understand,” said the magistrate. “Your stomach, which is more\nexacting in its demands than mine, is not satisfied with a cup of\nchocolate till dinner-time. So, go and get your lunch; on your return,\nyou will find me here. You may now conclude the report, and request\nthese parties to sign it.”\n\nUrged on by hunger, the clerk hastily mumbled over the remainder of the\nformula, called all the names that he had inserted in the report, and\neach of the servants advanced in turn, signed his or her name, or made\na cross, and then retired. Madame Leon read in the judge’s face that she\nalso was expected to withdraw; and she was reluctantly leaving the room,\nwhen Mademoiselle Marguerite detained her to ask: “Are you quite sure\nthat nothing has come for me to-day?”\n\n“Nothing, mademoiselle; I went in person to inquire of the concierge.”\n\n“Did you post my letter last night?”\n\n“Oh! my dear young lady, can you doubt it?”\n\nThe young girl stifled a sigh, and then, with a gesture of dismissal,\nshe remarked, “M. de Fondege must be sent for.”\n\n“The General?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I will send for him at once,” replied the housekeeper; and thereupon\nshe left the room, closing the door behind her with a vicious slam.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nThe justice of the peace and Mademoiselle Marguerite were at last alone\nin M. de Chalusse’s study. This room, which the count had preferred\nabove all others, was a spacious, magnificent, but rather gloomy\napartment, with lofty walls and dark, richly carved furniture. Its\npresent aspect was more than ever solemn and lugubrious, for it gave\none a chill to see the bands of white tape affixed to the locks of the\ncabinets and bookcases. When the magistrate had installed himself in the\ncount’s arm-chair, and the girl had taken a seat near him, they remained\nlooking at each other in silence for a few moments. The magistrate\nwas asking himself how he should begin. Having fathomed Mademoiselle\nMarguerite’s extreme sensitiveness and reserve, he said to himself that\nif he offended or alarmed her, she would refuse him her confidence, in\nwhich case he would be powerless to serve her as he wished to do. He\nhad, in fact, an almost passionate desire to be of service to her,\nfeeling himself drawn toward her by an inexplicable feeling of sympathy,\nin which esteem, respect, and admiration alike were blended, though he\nhad only known her for a few hours. Still, he must make a beginning.\n“Mademoiselle,” he said, at last, “I abstained from questioning you\nbefore the servants--and if I take the liberty of doing so now, it\nis not, believe me, out of any idle curiosity; moreover, you are not\ncompelled to answer me. But you are young--and I am an old man; and it\nis my duty--even if my heart did not urge me to do so--to offer you the\naid of my experience----”\n\n“Speak, monsieur,” interrupted Marguerite. “I will answer your questions\nfrankly, or else not answer them at all.”\n\n“To resume, then,” said he, “I am told that M. de Chalusse has no\nrelatives, near or remote. Is this the truth?”\n\n“So far as I know--yes, monsieur. Still, I have heard it said that a\nsister of his, Mademoiselle Hermine de Chalusse, abandoned her home\ntwenty-five or thirty years ago, when she was about my age, and that\nshe has never received her share of the enormous fortune left by her\nparents.”\n\n“And has this sister never given any sign of life?”\n\n“Never! Still, monsieur, I have promised you to be perfectly frank. That\nletter which the Count de Chalusse received yesterday, that letter which\nI regard as the cause of his death--well, I have a presentiment that it\ncame from his sister. It could only have been written by her or--by that\nother person whose letters--and souvenirs--you found in the escritoire.”\n\n“And--this other person--who can she be?” As the young girl made no\nreply, the magistrate did not insist, but continued: “And you, my child,\nwho are you?”\n\nShe made a gesture of sorrowful resignation, and then, in a voice\nfaltering with emotion, she answered: “I do not know, monsieur. Perhaps\nI am the count’s daughter. I should be telling an untruth if I said that\nwas not my belief. Yes, I believe it, but I have never been certain of\nit. Sometimes I have believed, sometimes I have doubted it. On certain\ndays I have said to myself, ‘Yes, it must be so!’ and I have longed to\nthrow my arms around his neck. But at other times I have exclaimed: ‘No,\nit isn’t possible!’ and I have almost hated him. Besides, he never said\na word on the subject--never a decisive word, at least. When I saw him\nfor the first time, six years ago, I judged by the manner in which he\nforbade me to call him ‘father,’ that he would never answer any question\nI might ask on the subject.”\n\nIf there was a man in the world inaccessible to idle curiosity, it was\ncertainly this magistrate, whose profession condemned him to listen\nevery day to family grievances, neighborly quarrels, complaints,\naccusations, and slander. And yet as he listened to Mademoiselle\nMarguerite, he experienced that strange disquietude which seizes hold of\na person when a puzzling problem is presented. “Allow me to believe that\nmany decisive proofs may have escaped your notice on account of your\ninexperience,” he said.\n\nBut interrupting him with a gesture, she sadly remarked: “You are\nmistaken; I am not inexperienced.”\n\nHe could not help smiling at what he considered her self-conceit. “Poor\nchild!” said he; “how old are you? Eighteen?”\n\nShe shook her head. “Yes, by my certificate of birth I am only eighteen;\nbut by the sufferings I have endured I am, perhaps, older than you are,\nmonsieur, despite your white hair. Those who have lived such a life as\nI have, are never young; they are old in suffering, even in their\nchildhood. And if by experience you mean lack of confidence, a knowledge\nof good and evil, distrust of everything and everybody, mine, young girl\nthough I be, will no doubt equal yours.” She paused, hesitated for a\nmoment, and then continued: “But why should I wait for you to question\nme? It is neither sincere nor dignified on my part to do so. The person\nwho claims counsel owes absolute frankness to his adviser. I will speak\nto you as if I were communing with my own soul. I will tell you what no\nperson has ever known--no one, not even Pascal. And believe me, my\npast life was full of bitter misery, although you find me here in this\nsplendid house. But I have nothing to conceal; and if I have cause to\nblush, it is for others, not for myself.”\n\nPerhaps she was impelled by an irresistible desire to relieve her\noverburdened heart, after long years of self-restraint; perhaps she\nno longer felt sure of herself, and desired some other advice than\nthe dictates of her conscience, in presence of the calamity which had\nbefallen her. At all events, too much engrossed in her own thoughts to\nheed the magistrate’s surprise, or hear the words he faltered, she rose\nfrom her seat, and, with her hands pressed tightly on her throbbing\nbrow, she began to tell the story of her life.\n\n“My first recollections,” she said, “are of a narrow, cheerless\ncourtyard, surrounded by grim and massive walls, so high that I could\nscarcely see the top of them. At noontime in summer the sun visited one\nlittle corner, where there was a stone bench; but in winter it never\nshowed itself at all. There were five or six small, scrubby trees, with\nmoss-grown trunks and feeble branches, which put forth a few yellow\nleaves at springtime. We were some thirty children who assembled in\nthis courtyard--children from five to eight years old, all clad alike in\nbrown dresses, with a little blue handkerchief tied about our shoulders.\nWe all wore blue caps on week-days, and white ones on Sundays, with\nwoollen stockings, thick shoes, and a black ribbon, with a large metal\ncross dangling from our necks. Among us moved the good sisters, silent\nand sad, with their hands crossed in their large sleeves, their faces as\nwhite as their snowy caps, and their long strings of beads, set off\nwith numerous copper medals, clanking when they walked like prisoners’\nchains. As a rule, each face wore the same expression of resignation,\nunvarying gentleness, and inexhaustible patience. But there were some\nwho wore it only as one wears a mask--some whose eyes gleamed at\ntimes with passion, and who vented their cold, bitter anger upon us\ndefenceless children. However, there was one sister, still young and\nvery fair, whose manner was so gentle and so sad that even I, with\nmy mere infantile intelligence, felt that she must have some terrible\nsorrow. During play-time she often took me on her knee and embraced me\nwith convulsive tenderness, murmuring: ‘Dear little one! darling little\none!’ Sometimes her endearments were irksome to me, but I never allowed\nher to see it, for fear of making her still more sad; and in my heart I\nwas content and proud to suffer for and with her. Poor sister! I owe her\nthe only happy hours of my infancy. She was called Sister Calliste. I\ndo not know what has become of her, but often, when my heart fails me, I\nthink of her, and even now I cannot mention her name without tears.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite was indeed weeping--big tears which she made no\nattempt to conceal were coursing down her cheeks. It cost her a great\neffort to continue: “You have already understood, monsieur, what I\nmyself did not know for several years. I was in a foundling asylum, and\nI was a foundling myself. I cannot say that we lacked anything; and I\nshould be ungrateful if I did not say and feel that these good sisters\nwere charity personified. But, alas! their hearts had only a certain\namount of tenderness to distribute between thirty poor little girls, and\nso each child’s portion was small; the caresses were the same for all,\nand I longed to be loved differently, to have kind words and caresses\nfor myself alone. We slept in little white beds with snowy curtains,\nin a clean, well-ventilated dormitory, in the centre of which stood a\nstatue of the Virgin, who seemed to smile on us all alike. In winter we\nhad a fire. Our clothes were warm and neat; our food was excellent.\nWe were taught to read and write, to sew and embroider. There was a\nrecreation hour between all the exercises. Those who were studious and\ngood were rewarded; and twice a week we were taken into the country for\na long walk. It was during one of these excursions that I learned from\nthe talk of the passers-by, what we were, and what we were called.\nSometimes, in the afternoon, we were visited by elegantly-attired\nladies, who were accompanied by their own children, radiant with health\nand happiness. The good sisters told us that these were ‘pious ladies,’\nor ‘charitable ladies,’ whom we must love and respect, and whom we must\nnever forget to mention in our prayers. They always brought us toys and\ncakes. Sometimes the establishment was visited by priests and grave old\ngentlemen, whose sternness of manner alarmed us. They peered into every\nnook and corner, asked questions about everything, assured themselves\nthat everything was in its place, and some of them even tasted our soup.\nThey were always satisfied; and the lady superior led them through the\nbuilding, and bowed to them, exclaiming: ‘We love them so much, the poor\nlittle dears! ‘And the gentlemen replied: ‘Yes, yes, my dear sister,\nthey are very fortunate.’ And the gentlemen were right. Poor laborers’\nchildren are often obliged to endure privations which we knew nothing\nof; they are often obliged to make their supper off a piece of dry\nbread--but, then, the crust is given them by their mother, with a kiss.”\n\nThe magistrate, who was extremely ill at ease, had not yet succeeded in\nfinding a syllable to offer in reply. Indeed, Mademoiselle Marguerite\nhad not given him an opportunity to speak, so rapidly had this\nlong-repressed flood of recollections poured from her lips. When she\nspoke the word “mother,” the magistrate fancied she would show some sign\nof emotion.\n\nBut he was mistaken. On the contrary, her voice became harsher, and a\nflash of anger, as it were, darted from her eyes.\n\n“I suffered exceedingly in that asylum,” she resumed. “Sister Calliste\nleft the establishment, and all the surroundings chilled and repelled\nme. My only few hours of happiness were on Sundays, when we attended\nchurch. As the great organ pealed, and as I watched the priests\nofficiating at the altar in their gorgeous vestments, I forgot my own\nsorrows. It seemed to me that I was ascending on the clouds of incense\nto the celestial sphere which the sisters so often talked to us about,\nand where they said each little girl would find her mother.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite hesitated for an instant, as if she were\nsomewhat unwilling to give utterance to her thoughts; but at last,\nforcing herself to continue, she said: “Yes, I suffered exceedingly in\nthat foundling asylum. Almost all my little companions were spiteful,\nunattractive in person, sallow, thin, and afflicted with all kinds of\ndiseases, as if they were not unfortunate enough in being abandoned\nby their parents. And--to my shame, monsieur, I must confess it--these\nunfortunate little beings inspired me with unconquerable repugnance,\nwith disgust bordering on aversion. I would rather have pressed my lips\nto a red-hot iron than to the forehead of one of these children. I did\nnot reason on the subject, alas! I was only eight or nine years old;\nbut I felt this antipathy in every fibre of my being. The others knew it\ntoo; and, in revenge, they ironically styled me ‘the lady,’ and left me\nseverely alone. But sometimes, during playtime, when the good sisters’\nbacks were turned, the children attacked me, beat me, and scratched my\nface and tore my clothes. I endured these onslaughts uncomplainingly,\nfor I was conscious that I deserved them. But how many reprimands my\ntorn clothes cost me! How many times I received only a dry crust for my\nsupper, after being soundly scolded and called ‘little careless.’ But\nas I was quiet, studious, and industrious, a quicker learner than the\nmajority of my companions, the sisters were fond of me. They said that I\nwas a promising girl, and that they would have no difficulty in finding\nme a nice home with some of the rich and pious ladies who have a share\nin managing institutions of this kind. The only fault the sisters found\nwith me was that I was sullen. But such was not really the case; I was\nonly sad and resigned. Everything around me so depressed and saddened me\nthat I withdrew into myself, and buried all my thoughts and aspirations\ndeep in my heart. If I had naturally been a bad child, I scarcely know\nwhat would have been the result of this. I have often asked myself the\nquestion in all sincerity, but I have been unable to reply, for one\ncannot be an impartial judge respecting one’s self. However, this much\nis certain, although childhood generally leaves a train of pleasant\nrecollections in a young girl’s life, mine was only fraught with torture\nand misery, desperate struggles, and humiliation. I was unwilling to\nbe confirmed because I did not wish to wear a certain dress, which a\n‘benevolent lady’ had presented for the use of the asylum, and which had\nbelonged to a little girl of my own age who had died of consumption.\nThe thought of arraying myself in this dress to approach the holy table\nfrightened and revolted me as much as if I had been sentenced to\ndrape myself in a winding-sheet. And yet it was the prettiest dress of\nall--white muslin beautifully embroidered. It had been ardently coveted\nby the other children, and had been given to me as a sort of reward of\nmerit. And I dared not explain the cause of my unconquerable repugnance.\nWho would have understood me? I should only have been accused of undue\nsensitiveness and pride, absurd in one of my humble position. I was then\nonly twelve years old; but no one knew the struggle in my mind save\nthe old priest, my confessor. I could confess everything to him; he\nunderstood me, and did not reproach me. Still he answered: ‘You must\nwear this dress, my child, for your pride must be broken. Go--I shall\nimpose no other penance on you.’ I obeyed him, full of superstitious\nterror; for it seemed to me that this was a frightful omen which would\nbring me misfortune, my whole life through. And I was confirmed in the\ndead girl’s embroidered dress.”\n\nDuring the five-and-twenty years that he had held the position of\njustice of the peace, the magistrate had listened to many confessions,\nwrung from wretched souls by stern necessity, or sorrow, but never had\nhis heart been moved as it now was, by this narrative, told with such\nuncomplaining anguish, and in a tone of such sincerity. However she\nresumed her story. “The confirmation over, our life became as gloomily\nmonotonous as before; we read the same pious books and did the same work\nat the same hours as formerly. It seemed to me that I was stifling in\nthis atmosphere. I gasped for breath, and thought that anything would\nbe preferable to this semblance of existence, which was not real life.\nI was thinking of applying for the ‘good situation,’ which had so often\nbeen mentioned to me, when one morning I was summoned into the steward’s\noffice--a mysterious and frightful place to us children. He himself\nwas a stout, dirty man, wearing large blue spectacles and a black\nsilk skullcap; and from morning until night, summer and winter, he sat\nwriting at a desk behind a little grating, hung with green curtains.\nRound the room were ranged the registers, in which our names were\nrecorded and our appearances described, together with the boxes\ncontaining the articles found upon us, which were carefully preserved\nto assist in identifying us should occasion arise. I entered this office\nwith a throbbing heart. In addition to the stout gentleman and the\nLady Superior, I found there a thin, wiry man, with cunning eyes, and a\nportly woman, with a coarse but rather good-natured face. The superior\nat once informed me that I was in the presence of M. and Madame Greloux,\nbookbinders, who had come to the asylum in search of two apprentices,\nand she asked me if I should like to be one of them. Ah! monsieur, it\nseemed to me that heaven had opened before me and I boldly replied:\n‘Yes.’ The gentleman in the black skullcap immediately emerged from his\nplace behind the grating to explain my obligations and duties to me\nat length, especially insisting upon the point, that I ought to be\ngrateful--I, a miserable foundling, reared by public charity--for the\ngenerosity which this good gentleman and lady showed in offering to\ntake charge of me and employ me in their workshop. I must confess that\nI could not clearly realize in what this great generosity which he so\nhighly praised consisted, nor did I perceive any reason why I should be\nparticularly grateful. Still, to all the conditions imposed upon me,\nI answered, ‘Yes, yes, yes!’ so heartily that Madame Greloux seemed\ngreatly pleased. ‘It is evident that the child will be glad to get\naway,’ she said to herself. Then the superior began to enumerate the\nobligations my employers would incur, repeating again and again that\nI was one of the very best girls in the asylum--pious, obedient, and\nindustrious, reading and writing to perfection, and knowing how to sew\nand embroider as only those who are taught in such institutions can. She\nmade Madame Greloux promise to watch over me as she would have watched\nover her own daughter; never to leave me alone; to take me to church,\nand allow me an occasional Sunday afternoon, so that I might pay a visit\nto the asylum. The gentleman with the spectacles and the skullcap\nthen reminded the bookbinder of the duties of an employer toward his\napprentices, and turning to a bookcase behind him, he even took down a\nlarge volume from which he read extract after extract, which I listened\nto without understanding a word, though I was quite sure that the book\nwas written in French. At last, when the man and his wife had said\n‘Amen’ to everything, the gentleman with the spectacles drew up a\ndocument which we all signed in turn. I belonged to a master.”\n\nShe paused. Here her childhood ended. But almost immediately she\nresumed: “My recollections of these people are not altogether\nunpleasant. They were harassed and wearied by their efforts to support\ntheir son in a style of living far above their position; but, despite\ntheir sacrifices, their son had no affection for them, and on this\naccount I pitied them. However, not only was the husband gloomy and\nquick-tempered, but his wife also was subject to fits of passion, so\nthat the apprentices often had a hard time of it. Still, between Madame\nGreloux’s tempests of wrath there were occasional gleams of sunshine.\nAfter beating us for nothing, she would exclaim, with quite as little\nreason, ‘Come and kiss me, and don’t pout any more. Here are four sous;\ngo and buy yourself some cakes.’”\n\nThe justice started in his arm-chair. Was it, indeed, Mademoiselle\nMarguerite who was speaking, the proud young girl with a queenlike\nbearing, whose voice rang out like crystal? Was it she indeed, who\nimitated the harsh, coarse dialect of the lower classes with such\naccuracy of intonation? Ah! at that moment, as her past life rose so\nvividly before her, it seemed to her as if she were still in the\nyears gone by, and she fancied she could still hear the voice of the\nbookbinder’s wife.\n\nShe did not even notice the magistrate’s astonishment. “I had left the\nasylum,” she continued, “and that was everything to me. I felt that a\nnew and different life was beginning, and that was enough. I flattered\nmyself that I might win a more earnest and sincere affection among these\nhonest, industrious toilers, than I had found in the asylum; and to win\nit and deserve it, I neglected nothing that good-will could suggest, or\nstrength allow. My patrons no doubt fathomed my desire, and naturally\nenough, perhaps unconsciously, they took advantage of my wish to please.\nI can scarcely blame them. I had entered their home under certain\nconditions in view of learning a profession; they gradually made me\ntheir servant--it was praiseworthy economy on their part. What I had at\nfirst done of my own freewill and from a wish to please, at last became\nmy daily task, which I was rigidly required to fulfil. Compelled to rise\nlong before any one else in the house, I was expected to have everything\nin order by the time the others made their appearance with their eyes\nstill heavy with sleep. It is true that my benefactors rewarded me after\ntheir fashion. On Sundays they took me with them on their excursions\ninto the country, so as to give me a rest, they said, after the week’s\nwork. And I followed them along the dusty highways in the hot sunshine,\npanting, perspiring, and tottering under the weight of a heavy basket\nof provisions, which were eaten on the grass or in the woods, and\nthe remnants of which fell to me. Madame Greloux’s brother generally\naccompanied us; and his name would have lingered in my memory, even if\nit had not been a peculiar one. He was called Vantrasson. He was a tall,\nrobust man, with eyes that made me tremble whenever he fixed them upon\nme. He was a soldier; intensely proud of his uniform; a great talker,\nand enchanted with himself. He evidently thought himself irresistible.\nIt was from that man’s mouth that I heard the first coarse word at which\nmy unsophisticated heart took offence. It was not to be the last one.\nHe finally told me that he had taken a fancy to me, and I was obliged to\ncomplain to Madame Greloux of her brother’s persecutions. But she only\nlaughed at me, and said: ‘Nonsense! He’s merely talking to hear himself\ntalk.’ Yes, that was her answer. And yet she was an honest woman, a\ndevoted wife, and a fond mother. Ah! if she had had a daughter. But with\na poor apprentice, who has neither father nor mother, one need not\nbe over-fastidious. She had made a great many promises to the lady\nsuperior, but she fancied that the utterance of a few commonplace words\nof warning relieved her of all further obligations. ‘And so much the\nworse for those who allow themselves to be fooled,’ she always added in\nconclusion.\n\n“Fortunately, my pride, which I had so often been reproached with,\nshielded me. My condition might be humble, but my spirit was lofty.\nIt was a blessing from God, this pride of mine, for it saved me from\ntemptation, while so many fell around me. I slept, with the other\napprentices, in the attic, where we were entirely beyond the control of\nthose who should have been our guardians. That is to say, when the day’s\ntoil was over, and the work-shop closed, we were free--abandoned to\nour own instincts, and the most pernicious influences. And neither evil\nadvice nor bad example was wanting. The women employed in the bindery\nin nowise restrained themselves in our presence, and we heard them tell\nmarvellous stories that dazzled many a poor girl. They did not talk as\nthey did from any evil design, or out of a spirit of calculation, but\nfrom pure thoughtlessness, and because they were quite devoid of moral\nsense. And they never tired of telling us of the pleasures of life, of\nfine dinners at restaurants, gay excursions to Joinville-le-Pont, and\nmasked balls at Montparnasse or the Elysee Montmartre. Ah! experience\nis quickly gained in these work-shops. Sometimes those who went off at\nnight with ragged dresses and worn-out shoes, returned the next morning\nin superb toilettes to say that they resigned their situations, as they\nwere not made for work, and intended to live like ladies. They departed\nradiant, but often before a month was over they came back, emaciated,\nhollow-eyed, and despairing, and humbly begged for a little work.”\n\nShe paused, so crushed by the weight of these sad memories as to lose\nconsciousness of the present. And the judge also remained silent, not\ndaring to question her. And, besides, what good would it do? What could\nshe tell him about these poor little apprentices that he did not know\nalready? If he was surprised at anything, it was that this beautiful\nyoung girl, who had been left alone and defenceless, had possessed\nsufficient strength of character to escape the horrible dangers that\nthreatened her.\n\nHowever, it was not long before Mademoiselle Marguerite shook off the\ntorpor which had stolen over her. “I ought not to boast of my strength,\nsir,” she resumed. “Besides my pride, I had a hope to sustain me--a hope\nwhich I clung to with the tenacity of despair. I wished to become expert\nat my profession, for I had learned that skilled workers were always in\ndemand, and could always command good wages. So when my household duties\nwere over, I still found time to learn the business, and made such rapid\nprogress that I astonished even my employer. I knew that I should soon\nbe able to make five or six francs a day; and this prospect was pleasant\nenough to make me forget the present, well-nigh intolerable as it\nsometimes was. During the last winter that I spent with my employers,\ntheir orders were so numerous and pressing that they worked on Sundays\nas well as on week days, and it was with difficulty that I obtained an\nhour twice a month to pay a visit to the good sisters who had cared for\nme in my childhood. I had never failed in this duty, and indeed it had\nnow become my only pleasure. My employer’s conscience compelled him to\npay me a trifle occasionally for the additional toil he imposed upon me,\nand the few francs I thus received I carried to the poor children at the\nasylum. After living all my life on public charity, I was able to\ngive in my turn; and this thought gratified my pride, and increased\nmy importance in my own eyes. I was nearly fifteen, and my term of\napprenticeship had almost expired, when one bright day in March, I saw\none of the lay sisters of the asylum enter the work-room. She was in a\nflutter of excitement; her face was crimson, and she was so breathless\nfrom her hurried ascent of the stairs that she gasped rather than\nsaid to me: ‘Quick! come--follow me! Some one is waiting for you!’\n‘Who?--where?’--‘Make haste! Ah! my dear child, if you only knew----’ I\nhesitated; but Madame Greloux pushed me toward the door, exclaiming:\n‘Be off, you little stupid!’ I followed the sister without thinking\nof changing my dress--without even removing the kitchen apron I wore.\nDownstairs, at the front door, stood the most magnificent carriage I had\never seen in my life. Its rich silk cushions were so beautiful that\nI scarcely dared to enter it; and I was all the more intimidated by\na footman in gorgeous livery, who respectfully opened the door at our\napproach. ‘You must get into the carriage,’ said the sister; ‘it\nwas sent for you.’ I obeyed her, and before I had recovered from my\nastonishment we had reached the asylum, and I was ushered into the\noffice where the contract which bound me as an apprentice had been\nsigned. As soon as I entered, the superior took me by the hand and led\nme toward a gentleman who was sitting near the window. ‘Marguerite,’\nsaid she, ‘salute Monsieur le Comte de Chalusse.’”\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nFor some little time there had been a noise of footsteps and a subdued\nmurmur of voices in the vestibule. Annoyed by this interruption,\nalthough he perfectly understood its cause, the magistrate rose and\nhastily opened the door. He was not mistaken. His clerk had returned\nfrom lunch, and the time of waiting seemed extremely long to him. “Ah!\nit’s you,” said the magistrate. “Very well! begin your inventory. It\nwon’t be long before I join you.” And closing the door he resumed his\nseat again. Mademoiselle Marguerite was so absorbed in her narrative\nthat she scarcely noticed this incident, and he had not seated himself\nbefore she resumed. “In all my life, I had never seen such an imposing\nlooking person as the Count de Chalusse. His manner, attire, and\nfeatures could not fail to inspire a child like me with fear and\nrespect. I was so awed that I had scarcely enough presence of mind to\nbow to him. He glanced at me coldly, and exclaimed: ‘Ah! is this\nthe young girl you were speaking of?’ The count’s tone betrayed such\ndisagreeable surprise that the superior was dismayed. She looked at me,\nand seemed indignant at my more than modest attire. ‘It’s a shame\nto allow a child to leave home dressed in this fashion,’ she angrily\nexclaimed. And she almost tore my huge apron off me, and then with\nher own hands began to arrange my hair as if to display me to better\nadvantage. ‘Ah! these employers,’ she exclaimed, ‘the best of them are\nbad. How they do deceive you. It’s impossible to place any confidence in\ntheir promises. Still, one can’t always be at their heels.’\n\n“But the superior’s efforts were wasted, for M. de Chalusse had turned\naway and had begun talking with some gentlemen near by. For the office\nwas full that morning. Five or six gentlemen, whom I recognized as the\ndirectors of the asylum, were standing round the steward in the black\nskullcap. They were evidently talking about me. I was certain of this by\nthe glances they gave me, glances which, however, were full of kindness.\nThe superior joined the group and began speaking with unusual vivacity,\nwhile standing in the recess of a window, I listened with all my might.\nBut I must have overestimated my intelligence, for I could gain no\nmeaning whatever from the phrases which followed each other in rapid\nsuccession; though the words ‘adoption,’ ‘emancipation,’ ‘dowry,’\n‘compensation,’ ‘reimbursement for sums expended,’ recurred again and\nagain. I was only certain of one point: the Count de Chalusse wished\nsomething, and these gentlemen were specifying other things in exchange.\nTo each of their demands he answered: ‘Yes, yes--it’s granted. That’s\nunderstood.’ But at last he began to grow impatient, and in a voice\nwhich impressed one with the idea that he was accustomed to command, he\nexclaimed, ‘I will do whatever you wish. Do you desire anything more?’\nThe gentlemen at once became silent, and the superior hastily declared\nthat M. de Chalusse was a thousand times too good, but that one could\nexpect no less of him, the last representative of one of the greatest\nand oldest families of France.\n\n“I cannot describe the surprise and indignation that were raging in my\nsoul. I divined--I felt that it was MY fate, MY future, MY life that\nwere being decided, and I was not even consulted on the matter. They\nwere disposing of me as if they were sure in advance of my consent. My\npride revolted at the thought, but I could not find a word to say in\nprotest. Crimson with shame, confused and furious, I was wondering how I\ncould interfere, when suddenly the consultation ceased and the gentlemen\nat once surrounded me. One of them, a little old man with a vapid smile\nand twinkling eyes, tapped me on the cheek, and said: ‘So she is as good\nas she is pretty!’ I could have struck him; but all the others laughed\napprovingly, with the exception of M. de Chalusse, whose manner became\nmore and more frigid, and whose lips wore a constrained smile, as if he\nhad resolved to keep his temper despite all provocation. It seemed to me\nthat he was suffering terribly, and I afterward learned that I had not\nbeen mistaken. Far from imitating the old gentleman’s manner, he bowed\nto me very gravely, with an air of deference that quite abashed me, and\nwent away after saying that he would return the next day to conclude the\narrangements.\n\n“I was at last left alone with the superior, whom I longed to question,\nbut she gave me no time to do so, for with extreme volubility she began\nto tell me of my surprising good fortune, which was an unanswerable\nand conclusive proof of the kindness and protection of Providence. ‘The\ncount,’ she said, ‘was to become my guardian. He would certainly give me\na dowry; and by and by, if I were grateful to him for his goodness, he\nwould adopt me, a poor, fatherless and motherless girl, and I should\nbear the great name of Durtal de Chalusse, and inherit an immense\nfortune.’ In conclusion, she said that there was no limit to the count’s\ngenerosity, that he had consented to reimburse the asylum the money that\nhad been spent on me, that he had offered to dower, I do not know how\nmany poor girls, and that he had promised to build a chapel for the use\nof the establishment. This was all true, incredible as it might seem.\nThat very morning, M. de Chalusse had called at the asylum, declared\nthat he was old and childless, a bachelor without any near relatives,\nand that he wished to adopt a poor orphan. They had given him a list\nof all the children in the institution, and he had chosen me. ‘A mere\nchance, my dear Marguerite,’ repeated the superior. ‘A mere chance--or\nrather a true miracle.’ It did, indeed, seem a miracle, but I was more\nsurprised than elated. I longed to be alone, so as to deliberate and\nreflect, for I knew that I was free to accept or decline this dazzling\noffer.\n\n“I timidly asked permission to return to my employers to inform them of\nwhat had happened and consult with them; but my request was refused. The\nsuperior told me that I must deliberate and decide alone; and that when\nonce my decision was taken, there could be no change. So I remained at\nthe asylum, and dined at the superior’s table; and during the night I\noccupied the room of a sister who was absent. What surprised me most of\nall was the deference with which I was treated. The sisters all seemed\nto consider me a person of great importance. And yet I hesitated.\n\n“My indecision may seem absurd and hypocritical; but it was really\nsincere. My present situation was certainly by no means an enviable one.\nBut the worst was over; my term as an apprentice had nearly expired, and\nmy future seemed assured. My future! What could it be with the Count de\nChalusse? It was painted in such brilliant colors that it frightened me.\nWhy had the count chosen me in preference to any of the other girls? Was\nit really chance which had decided him in his choice? On reflecting,\nthe miracle seemed to me to have been prepared in advance, and I fancied\nthat it must conceal some mystery. More than this, the thought of\nyielding myself up to a stranger terrified me. Forty-eight hours had\nbeen granted me to consider my decision, and till the very last instant\nI remained in doubt. Who knows? Perhaps it would have been better for me\nif I had returned to my humble life. At all events, I should have been\nspared a great deal of sorrow and humiliation. But I lacked the courage;\nand when the time expired, I consented to the new arrangement.\n\n“Should I live a thousand years I shall never forget the day I left\nthe foundling asylum to become the Count de Chalusse’s ward. It was\na Saturday, and I had given my answer to the superior on the evening\nbefore. The next morning I received a visit from my former employers,\nwho, having been informed of the great change in my prospects, had come\nto bid me good-bye. The cancelling of my apprenticeship had at first\ncaused some trouble, but eventually the count’s gold silenced their\nobjections. Still, they were sorry to part with me, as I plainly saw.\nTheir eyes were moist with tears. They were sorry to lose the poor\nlittle servant who had served them so faithfully. At the same time,\nhowever, I noticed evident constraint in their manner. They no longer\nsaid ‘thee’ and ‘thou’ to me; they no longer spoke roughly; but they\nsaid ‘you,’ and addressed me as ‘mademoiselle.’ Poor people! they\nawkwardly apologized for having ventured to accept my services,\ndeclaring in the same breath that they should never be able to replace\nme at the same price. Madame Greloux, moreover, declared that she should\nnever forgive herself for not having sharply reproved her brother for\nhis abominable conduct. He was a good-for-nothing fellow, she said, as\nwas proved by the fact that he had dared to raise his eyes to me. For\nthe first time in my life, I felt that I was sincerely loved; and I was\nso deeply touched that if my decision had not been written and signed, I\nshould certainly have returned to live with these worthy people. But it\nwas too late. A sister came to tell me that the superior wished to see\nme. I bade Father and Mother Greloux farewell and went downstairs.\n\n“In the superior’s room, a lady and two shop-girls, laden with boxes and\nparcels, were waiting for me. It was a dressmaker who had come with some\nclothes suited to my new station in life. I was told that she had\nbeen sent by the Count de Chalusse. This great nobleman thought of\neverything; and, although he had thirty servants to do his bidding, he\nnever disdained to occupy himself with the pettiest details. So, for\nthe first time, I was arrayed in rustling silk and clinging cashmere.\nMy toilette was no trifling affair. All the good sisters clustered round\nme, and tried to beautify me with the same care and patience as they\nwould have displayed in adorning the Virgin’s statue for a fete-day. A\nsecret instinct warned me that they were overdoing the matter, and that\nthey were making me look ridiculous; but I did not mind. I allowed them\nto please themselves I could still feel Madame Greloux’s tears on my\nhand, and the scene seemed to me as lugubrious as the last toilette of a\nprisoner under sentence of death. When they had completed their task,\nI heard a buzz of admiration round me. If the sisters were worthy of\nbelief, they had never seen such a wonderful transformation. Those who\nwere in the class-rooms or the sewing-room, were summoned to view and\nadmire me, and some of the elder children were also admitted. Perhaps I\nwas intended as an example for the latter, for I heard the lady superior\nsay to them, ‘You see, my dear children, the result of good behavior. Be\ndiligent and dutiful, like our dear Marguerite, and God will reward\nyou as He has rewarded her.’ And, meantime, miserable in my finery, I\nwaited--waited for M. de Chalusse, who was coming to take me away.\n\n“At the appointed hour he appeared, with the same air of haughty\nreserve, that had so awed me on the occasion of our first meeting. He\nscarcely deigned to look at me, and although I watched him with poignant\nanxiety, I could read neither blame nor approval on his face. ‘You see\nthat your wishes have been scrupulously obeyed, Monsieur le Comte,’ said\nthe superior. ‘I thank you,’ he replied; ‘and I shall prove the extent\nof my gratitude to the poor children under your charge.’ Then, turning\nto me: ‘Marguerite,’ he said, ‘take leave of--your mothers, and tell\nthem that you will never forget their kindness.’”\n\nThe girl paused, for her emotion had rendered her words almost\nunintelligible. But, with an effort, she speedily conquered her\nweakness.\n\n“It was only then,” she continued, “that I realized how much I loved\nthese poor nuns, whom I had sometimes almost cursed. I felt now how\nclose the ties were, that bound me to this hospitable roof, and to these\nunfortunate children, my companions in misery and loneliness. It seemed\nto me as if my heart were breaking; and the superior, who was generally\nso impassible, appeared scarcely less moved than myself. At last, M. de\nChalusse took me by the hand and led me away. In the street there was a\ncarriage waiting for us, not such a beautiful one as that which had been\nsent to fetch me from my workshop, but a much larger one, with trunks\nand boxes piled on its roof. It was drawn by four gray horses. I felt\nmore dead than alive, as I entered the carriage and took the seat which\nthe count pointed out. He sat down opposite to me. All the sisters had\nassembled at the door of the asylum, and even the superior wept without\nmaking any attempt to hide her tears. ‘Farewell!’ they all cried;\n‘farewell, farewell, dear child! Don’t forget your old friends. We shall\npray for your happiness.’ Alas! God could not have heard their prayers.\nAt a sign from M. de Chalusse, a footman closed the door, the postilions\ncracked their whips, and the heavy vehicle rolled away.\n\n“The die was cast. Henceforth, an impassable gulf was to separate me\nfrom this asylum, whither I had been carried in my infancy half dead,\nand wrapped in swaddling clothes, from which every mark that could\npossibly lead to identification had been carefully cut away. Whatever my\nfuture might prove, I felt that my past was gone forever. But I was\ntoo greatly agitated even to think; and crouching in a corner of the\ncarriage, I watched M. de Chalusse with the poignant anxiety a slave\ndisplays as he studies his new master. Ah! monsieur, what a wondrous\nchange! A mask seemed to have fallen from the count’s face; his lips\nquivered, a tender light beamed in his eyes, and he drew me to him,\nexclaiming: ‘Oh, Marguerite! my beloved Marguerite! At last--at last!’\nHe sobbed--this old man, whom I had thought as cold and as insensible as\nmarble; he crushed me in his close embrace, he almost smothered me\nwith kisses. And I was frightfully agitated by the strange, indefinable\nfeeling, kindled in my heart; but I no longer trembled with fear.\nAn inward voice whispered that this was but the renewal of a former\ntie--one which had somehow been mysteriously broken. However, as I\nremembered the superior’s assertion that it was a miracle in my favor--a\nwonderful interposition of Providence, I had courage enough to ask: ‘So\nit was not chance that guided you in your choice?’\n\n“My question seemed to take him by surprise. ‘Poor Marguerite!’ he\nmurmured, ‘dearly beloved child! for years I have been laboring to bring\nabout this chance!’ Instantly all the romantic stories I had heard in\nthe asylum recurred to my mind. And Heaven knows there are plenty of\nthese stories transmitted by the sisters from generation to generation,\ntill they have become a sort of Golden Legend for poor foundlings. That\nsad formula, ‘Father and mother unknown,’ which figures on certificates\nof birth, acts as a dangerous stimulant for unhealthy imaginations, and\nleaves an open door for the most extravagant hopes. And thus influenced,\nI fixed my eyes on the face of the Count de Chalusse, striving to\ndiscover some resemblance in his features to my own. But he did not\nseem to notice my intent gaze, and following his train of thought, he\nmuttered: ‘Chance! It was necessary that they should think so, and\nthey did think so. And yet the cleverest detectives in Paris, from old\nTabaret to Fortunat, both masters in the art of following up a clue, had\nexhausted their resources in helping me in my despairing search.’ The\nagony of suspense I was enduring had become intolerable; and unable\nto restrain myself longer, I exclaimed, with a wildly throbbing heart:\n‘Then, you are my father, Monsieur le Comte?’ He pressed his hand to my\nlips with such violence that he hurt me, and then, in a voice quivering\nwith excitement, he replied: ‘Imprudent girl! What can you mean?\nForget that unfortunate idea. Never utter the name of father--you hear\nme--never! I forbid it!’ He had become extremely pale, and he looked\nanxiously around him, as if he feared that some one had overheard me--as\nif he had forgotten that we were alone in a carriage which was dashing\nonward at full speed!\n\n“I was stupefied and alarmed by the sudden terror which M. de Chalusse\nhad displayed and could not control. What could it all mean? What\nsorrowful recollections, what mysterious apprehensions, had my words\naroused in the count’s mind? I could not understand or imagine why he\nshould regard my question as strange or unnatural. On the contrary, I\nthought it perfectly natural, dictated as it had been by circumstances,\nand by the count’s own words and manner. And, in spite of my confusion\nand agitation, the inexplicable voice which we call presentiment\nwhispered in my heart: ‘He has forbidden you to CALL him father, but\nhe has not said that he is not your father.’ However, I had not time to\nreflect or to question M. de Chalusse any more, though at that moment I\nshould have had the courage to do so; afterward I did not dare.\n\n“Our carriage had drawn up outside the railway station, and the next\ninstant we alighted. Then, for the first time, I learned the magical\npower of money, I, a poor girl--reared by public charity--and who for\nthree years had worked for my daily bread. M. de Chalusse found the\nservants, who were to accompany us, awaiting him. They had thought of\neverything, and made every possible arrangement for our comfort. I had\nscarcely time to glance round me before we were on the platform in front\nof a train, which was ready to start. I perceived the very carriage that\nhad brought us to the station already fastened on a low open truck, and\nI was advancing to climb into it, when M. de Chalusse stopped me. ‘Not\nthere,’ said he, ‘come with me.’ I followed him, and he led me to a\nmagnificent saloon carriage, much higher and roomier than the others,\nand emblazoned with the Chalusse coat-of-arms. ‘This is our carriage,\ndear Marguerite, he said. I got in. The whistle sounded; and the train\nstarted off.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite was growing very tired. Big drops of\nperspiration stood out on her forehead, she panted for breath, and her\nvoice began to fail her.\n\nThe magistrate was almost frightened. “Pray rest a little,\nmademoiselle,” he entreated, “there is no hurry.”\n\nBut she shook her head and replied: “It is better to go on. I should\nnever have courage to begin again if I paused.” And thereupon she\ncontinued: “I had never gone farther than Versailles. This journey was\nat first as delightful as a glimpse into fairy-land. Our carriage\nwas one of those costly whims which some millionaires indulge in. It\nconsisted of a central saloon--a perfect chef-d’oeuvre of taste and\nluxury--with two compartments at either end, furnished with comfortable\nsleeping accommodation. And all this, the count seemed never weary of\nrepeating, was mine--mine alone. Leaning back on the velvet cushions, I\ngazed at the changing landscape, as the train rushed madly on. Leaning\nover me, M. de Chalusse named all the towns and villages we passed:\nBrunoy, Melun, Fontainebleau, Villeneuve, Sens, Laroche. And each time\nthe train stopped the servants came to ask if we wished for anything.\nWhen we reached Lyons, in the middle of the night, we found a delicious\nsupper awaiting us. It was served as soon as we alighted, and in due\ntime we were warned that the train was ready to start, and then we\nresumed our journey. You can imagine, perhaps, how marvellous all this\nseemed to a poor little apprentice, whose only ambition a week before\nwas to earn five francs a day. What a change indeed! At last the count\nmade me retire to one of the compartments, where I soon fell asleep,\nabandoning my efforts to distinguish what was dreamlike in my situation\nfrom reality. However, when I woke up I became terribly anxious. I\nasked myself what was awaiting me at the end of this long journey. M.\nde Chalusse’s manner continued kind, and even affectionate; but he had\nregained his accustomed reserve and self-control, and I realized that\nit would be useless on my part to question him. At last, after a thirty\nhours’ journey by rail, we again entered the count’s berline, drawn\nby post-horses, and eventually M. de Chalusse said to me: ‘Here is\nCannes--we are at our journey’s end.’\n\n“In this town, which is one of the most charming that overlook the blue\nwaters of the Mediterranean, the count owned a palace embowered among\nlovely orange-trees, only a few steps from the sea, and in full view of\nthe myrtle and laurel groves which deck the isles of Sainte Marguerite.\nHe told me that he proposed spending a few months here in seclusion, so\nas to give me time to accustom myself to my new position and the luxury\nthat surrounded me. I was, indeed, extremely awkward, and my excessive\ntimidity was increased by my pride. I did not know what to say, or what\nto do. I did not know how to use my hands, nor how to walk, nor how\nto carry myself. Everything embarrassed and frightened me; and I was\nconscious of my awkwardness, without being able to remedy it. I saw my\nblunders, and knew that I spoke a different language to that which was\nspoken around me. And yet the memory of Cannes will ever be dear to me.\nFor there I first met the only friend I have now left in this world. I\ndid not exchange a word with him, but by the quickened throbbings of\nmy heart, when our eyes met, I felt that he would exert a powerful\ninfluence over my life, and events have since proved that I was not\ndeceived. At that time, however, he was a stranger to me; and nothing\non earth would have induced me to make inquiries concerning him. It\nwas only by chance I learned that he lived in Paris, that his name was\nPascal, and that he had come south as a companion to a sick friend.\n\n“By a single word the count could have insured the happiness of my\nlife and his own, but he did not speak it. He was the kindest and\nmost indulgent of guardians, and I was often affected to tears by his\ntenderness. But, although my slightest wish was law, he did not grant me\nhis confidence. The secret--the mystery that stood between us--was like\na wall of ice. Still, I was gradually becoming accustomed to my new\nlife, and my mind was regaining its equilibrium, when one evening the\ncount returned home more agitated and excited, if possible, than on the\nday of my departure from the asylum. He summoned his valet, and, in a\ntone that admitted no reply, he exclaimed, ‘I wish to leave Cannes at\nonce--I must start in less than an hour--so procure some post-horses\ninstantly.’ And in answer to my inquiring glance, he said: ‘It must\nbe. It would be folly to hesitate. Each moment increases the peril that\nthreatens us.’\n\n“I was very young, inexperienced, and totally ignorant of life; but my\nsufferings, my loneliness, and the prospect of being compelled to rely\nupon myself, had imparted to my mind that precocious maturity which is\nso often observed among the children of the poor. Knowing from the very\nfirst that there was some mystery connected with the count’s life, I had\nstudied him with a child’s patient sagacity--a sagacity which is all the\nmore dangerous, as it is unsuspected--and I had come to the conclusion\nthat a constant dread rendered his life a burden. Could it be for\nhimself that he trembled, this great nobleman, who was so powerful by\nreason of his exalted rank, his connections, and his wealth? Certainly\nnot. Was it for me, then? Undoubtedly it was. But why? It had not taken\nme long to discover that he was concealing me, or, at least, that he\nendeavored by all means in his power to prevent my presence in his house\nfrom being known beyond a very limited circle of friends. Our hurried\ndeparture from Cannes confirmed me in my impression.\n\n“It might have been truly called a flight. We left that same evening at\neleven o’clock, in a pouring rain, with the first horses that could be\nprocured. Our only attendant was the count’s valet--not Casimir, the man\nwho insulted me a little while ago--but another man, an old and valued\nservant, who has since died, unfortunately, and who possessed his\nmaster’s entire confidence. The other servants were dismissed with a\nprincely gratuity, and told to disperse two days after our departure. We\ndid not return to Paris, but journeyed toward the Italian frontier, and\non arriving at Nice in the dead of night, we drove directly to the quay.\nThe postilions unharnessed the horses, and we remained in the carriage.\nThe valet, however, hastened off, and more than two hours elapsed before\nhe returned. He declared that he had found it very difficult to procure\nwhat he wished for, but that at last, by a prodigal outlay of money, he\nhad succeeded in overcoming all obstacles. What M. de Chalusse desired\nwas a vessel ready for sea, and the bark which the valet had chartered\nnow came up to the quay. Our carriage was put on board, we went below,\nand before daybreak we were under way.\n\n“Three days later we were in Genoa, registered under a false name in a\nsecond class hotel. While we were on the open sea, the count had seemed\nto be less agitated, but now he was far from calm, and the precautions\nhe took proved that he still feared pursuit. A malefactor flying from\njustice could not have taken greater pains to mislead the detectives on\nhis track. And facts proved conclusively that I was the sole cause of\nthe count’s apprehension. On one occasion I even heard him discussing\nwith his valet the feasibility of clothing me in masculine attire.\nAnd it was only the difficulty of obtaining a suitable costume that\nprevented him from carrying this project into execution. I ought to\nmention, however, that the servant did not share his master’s anxiety,\nfor three or four times I overheard him saying: ‘The count is too\ngood to worry himself so much about such bad stock. Besides, she won’t\novertake us. It isn’t certain that she has even followed us. How can\nshe know anything about it?’ She! Who was she? This is what I racked my\nbrain to discover, but without success. I must confess, monsieur, that\nbeing of a practical nature, and not in the least degree romantic, I\narrived at the conclusion that the peril chiefly existed in the count’s\nimagination, or that he greatly exaggerated it. Still he suffered none\nthe less on that account, as was shown by the fact that the following\nmonth was spent in hurried journeys from one Italian city to another.\n\n“It was the end of May before M. de Chalusse would consent to return to\nFrance; and then we went direct to Lyons. We had spent a couple of days\nthere, when the count informed me that prudence required us to separate\nfor a time--that our safety demanded this sacrifice. And without giving\nme time to say a word, he began to explain the advantages that would\naccrue from such an arrangement. I was extremely ignorant, and he wished\nme to profit by our temporary separation to raise my knowledge to\na level with my new social position. He had, accordingly, made\narrangements for me to enter the convent of Sainte-Marthe, an\neducational establishment which is as celebrated in the department of\nthe Rhone as the Convent des Oiseaux is in Paris. He added that it would\nnot be prudent for him to visit me; and he made me solemnly promise that\nI would never mention his name to any of my schoolmates. I was to send\nany letters I might write to an address which he would give me, and he\nwould sign his answers with a fictitious name. He also told me that the\nlady superior of Sainte-Marthe knew his secret, and that I could confide\nin her. He was so restless and so miserably unhappy on the day when\nhe acquainted me with these plans, that I really believed him insane.\nNevertheless, I replied that I would obey him, and to tell the truth,\nI was not ill pleased at the thought of the change. My life with M.\nde Chalusse was a monotonous and cheerless one. I was almost dying of\nennui, for I had been accustomed to work, bustle, and confusion with the\nGreloux, and I felt delighted at the prospect of finding myself among\ncompanions of my own age.\n\n“Unfortunately, M. de Chalusse had forgotten one circumstance, which\nmade my two years’ sojourn at Sainte-Marthe a lingering and cruel agony.\nAt first I was kindly treated by my schoolmates. A new pupil is always\nwelcome, for her arrival relieves the monotony of convent-life. But it\nwas not long before my companions wished to know my name; and I had none\nother than Marguerite to give them. They were astonished and wished to\nknow who my parents were. I could not tell an untruth; and I was obliged\nto confess that I knew nothing at all respecting my father or my mother.\nAfter that ‘the bastard’--for such was the name they gave me--was soon\ncondemned to isolation. No one would associate with me during play-time.\nNo one would sit beside me in the school-room. At the piano lesson, the\ngirl who played after me pretended to wipe the keyboard carefully\nbefore commencing her exercises. I struggled bravely against this\nunjust ostracism; but all in vain. I was so unlike these other girls in\ncharacter and disposition, and I had, moreover, been guilty of a great\nimprudence. I had been silly enough to show my companions the costly\njewels which M. de Chalusse had given me, but which I never wore. And on\ntwo occasions I had proved to them that I had more money at my disposal\nthan all the other pupils together. If I had been poor, they would,\nperhaps, have treated me with affected sympathy; but as I was rich,\nI became an enemy. It was war; and one of those merciless wars which\nsometimes rage so furiously in convents, despite their seeming quiet.\n\n“I should surprise you, monsieur, if I told you what refined torture\nthese daughters of noblemen invented to gratify their petty spite. I\nmight have complained to the superior, but I scorned to do so. I buried\nmy sorrow deep in my heart, as I had done years before; and I firmly\nresolved never to show ought but a smiling, placid face, so as to prove\nto my enemies that they were powerless to disturb my peace of mind.\nStudy became my refuge and consolation; and I plunged into work with the\nenergy of despair. I should probably still live at Sainte-Marthe now,\nhad it not been for a trivial circumstance. One day I had a quarrel\nwith my most determined enemy, a girl named Anais de Rochecote. I was a\nthousand times right; and I would not yield. The superior dared not\ntell me I was wrong. Anais was furious, and wrote I don’t know what\nfalsehoods to her mother. Madame de Rochecote thereupon interested the\nmothers of five or six other pupils in her daughter’s quarrel, and one\nevening these ladies came in a body, and nobly and courageously demanded\nthat the ‘bastard’ should be expelled. It was impossible, outrageous,\nmonstrous, they declared, that their daughters should be compelled to\nassociate with a girl like me--a nameless girl, who humiliated the other\ngirls with her ill-gotten wealth. The superior tried to take my part;\nbut these ladies declared they would take their daughters from the\nconvent if I were not sent away. There was no help for it: I was\nsacrificed. Summoned by telegraph, M. de Chalusse hastened to Lyons, and\ntwo days later I left Sainte-Marthe with jeers and opprobrious epithets\nringing in my ears.”\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nOnce before, that very morning, the magistrate had witnessed a display\nof the virile energy with which misfortune and suffering had endowed\nthis proud but naturally timid girl. But he was none the less surprised\nat the sudden explosion of hatred which he now beheld; for it was\nhatred. The way in which Mademoiselle Marguerite’s voice had quivered as\nshe pronounced the name of Anais de Rochecote proved, unmistakably, that\nhers was one of those haughty natures that never forget an insult. All\nsigns of fatigue had now disappeared. She had sprung from her chair,\nand remembrance of the shameful, cowardly affront she had received had\nbrought a vivid flush to her cheeks and a bright gleam to her eyes.\n\n“This atrocious humiliation happened scarcely a year ago, monsieur,” she\nresumed; “and there is but little left for me to tell you. My expulsion\nfrom Sainte-Marthe made M. de Chalusse frantic with indignation. He knew\nsomething that I was ignorant of--that Madame de Rochecote, who enacted\nthe part of a severe and implacable censor, was famed for the laxity\nof her morals. The count’s first impulse was to wreak vengeance on my\npersecutors; for, in spite of his usual coolness, M. de Chalusse had a\nfurious temper at times. It was only with the greatest difficulty that\nI dissuaded him from challenging General de Rochecote, who was living\nat the time. However, it now became necessary to make some other\narrangements for me. M. de Chalusse offered to find another school,\npromising to take such precautions as would insure my peace of mind. But\nI interrupted him before he had spoken a dozen words, declaring I would\nrather return to the book-binders than chance another such experiment.\nAnd what I said I meant. A subterfuge--a fictitious name, for\ninstance--could alone shield me from persecution similar to what I had\nendured at Sainte-Marthe. But I knew that I was incapable of playing\nsuch a part--I felt that I should somehow confess everything. My\nfirmness imparted some resolution to M. de Chalusse. He exclaimed, with\nan oath, that I was right--that he was weary of all this deception and\nconcealment, and that he would make arrangements to have me near him.\n‘Yes,’ he concluded, embracing me, ‘the die is cast, come what may!’\n\n“However, these measures required a certain delay; and, in the meantime,\nhe decided to install me in Paris, which is the only place where one can\nsuccessfully hide from prying eyes. He purchased a small but convenient\nhouse, surrounded by a garden, in the neighborhood of the Luxembourg\nPalace, and here he installed me, with two old women and a trusty\nman-servant. As I needed a chaperon, he went in quest of one, and found\nMadame Leon.”\n\nOn hearing this name, the magistrate gave the young girl a searching\nlook, as if he hoped to discover what estimate she had formed of the\nhousekeeper’s character, as well as what degree of confidence she had\ngranted her. But Mademoiselle Marguerite’s face remained unaltered in\nexpression.\n\n“After so many trials,” she resumed, “I thought I should now find rest\nand peace. Yes, I believed so; and the few months I spent in that quiet\nhouse will be the happiest of my life--I am sure of it. Judge of my\nsurprise when, on going down into the little garden on the second day\nafter my arrival, I saw the young man whom I had met at Cannes, and\nwhose face had lingered in my memory for more than two years as the\ntype of all that was best and noblest in the human countenance. He was\nstanding near the gate. A cloud passed before my eyes. What mysterious\nfreak of fate had caused him to pause there at that particular moment?\nThis much is certain, he recognized me as I had recognized him. He\nbowed, smiling somewhat, and I fled indoors again, indignant with myself\nfor not being angry at his audacity. I made many plans that day, but the\nnext morning, at the same hour, I hid myself behind a Venetian blind,\nand saw him pause at the gate, and gaze at the garden with evident\nanxiety. I soon learned that he lived near by, with his widowed mother;\nand twice a day, when he went to the Palais de Justice and returned, he\npassed my home.”\n\nHer cheeks were crimson now, her eyes were lowered, and she was\nevidently embarrassed. But suddenly, as if ashamed of her blushes, she\nproudly raised her head, and said, in a firmer voice: “Shall I tell you\nour simple story? Is it necessary? I should not have concealed anything\nthat has passed from my mother, if I had been so happy as to possess a\nmother. A few moments’ conversation now and then, the exchange of a few\nletters, the pressure of a hand through the garden gate, and that is\nall. Still, I have been guilty of a grave and irreparable fault: I have\ndisobeyed the one rule of my life--frankness; and I am cruelly punished\nfor doing so. I did not tell all this to M. de Chalusse--in fact, I\ndared not. I was ashamed of my cowardice; from day to day I vowed that\nI would confess everything, and yet I procrastinated. I said to myself\nevery night, ‘It shall be done to-morrow; but when the morrow came I\nsaid, ‘I will give myself another day--just one more day.’ Indeed, my\ncourage failed me when I thought of the count’s aristocratic prejudices;\nand besides, I knew how ambitious he was for my future. On the other\nhand, moreover, Pascal was always pleading: ‘Don’t speak now. My\ncircumstances are constantly improving. The day is not far off when I\nshall be able to offer you wealth and fame. When that day comes I will\ngo to your guardian and ask him for your hand; but in Heaven’s name\ndon’t speak now.’ I understood Pascal’s motives well enough. The count’s\nimmense fortune frightened him, and he feared that he would be accused\nof being a fortune-hunter. So I waited, with that secret anguish which\nstill haunts those who have been unhappy even when their present is\npeaceful, and their future seems bright. I kept my secret, saying to\nmyself that such happiness was not meant for me, that it would soon take\nflight.\n\n“It took flight all too soon. One morning I heard a carriage draw up\noutside our door, and the next moment the Count de Chalusse entered\nthe sitting-room. ‘Everything is ready to receive you at the Hotel de\nChalusse, Marguerite,’ said he, ‘come!’ He ceremoniously offered me his\narm, and I accompanied him. I could not even leave a message for Pascal,\nfor I had never made a confidante of Madame Leon. Still, a faint hope\nsustained me. I thought that the precautions taken by M. de Chalusse\nwould somewhat dispel the uncertainty of my position, and furnish me at\nleast with some idea of the vague danger which threatened me. But no.\nHis efforts, so far as I could discover, had been confined to changing\nhis servants. Our life in this grand house was the same as it had been\nat Cannes--even more secluded, if that were possible. The count had aged\nconsiderably. It was evident that he was sinking beneath the burden\nof some ever-present sorrow. ‘I am condemning you to a cheerless and\nmelancholy youth,’ he sometimes said to me, ‘but it will not last\nforever--patience, patience!’ Did he really love me? I think so. But his\naffection showed itself in a strange manner. Sometimes his voice was so\ntender that my heart was touched. At others there was a look of hatred\nin his eyes which terrified me. Occasionally he was severe almost to\nbrutality, and then the next moment he would implore me to forgive him,\norder the carriage, take me with him to his jewellers’, and insist upon\nme accepting some costly ornaments. Madame Leon declares that my jewels\nare worth more than twenty thousand francs. At times I wondered if his\ncapricious affection and sternness were really intended for myself. It\noften seemed to me that I was only a shadow--the phantom of some absent\nperson, in his eyes. It is certain that he often requested me to dress\nmyself or to arrange my hair in a certain fashion, to wear such and such\na color, or to use a particular perfume which he gave me. Frequently,\nwhen I was moving about the house, he suddenly exclaimed: ‘Marguerite! I\nentreat you, remain just where you are!’\n\n“I obeyed him, but the illusion had already vanished. A sob or an oath\nwould come from his lips, and then in an angry voice he would bid me\nleave the room.”\n\nThe magistrate did not raise his eyes from his talismanic ring; it might\nhave been supposed that it had fascinated him. Still, his expression\ndenoted profound commiseration, and he shook his head thoughtfully. The\nidea had occurred to him that this unfortunate young girl had been the\nvictim, not precisely of a madman, but of one of those maniacs who have\njust enough reason left to invent the tortures they inflict upon those\naround them.\n\nSpeaking more slowly than before, as if she were desirous of attracting\nincreased attention on the magistrate’s part, Mademoiselle Marguerite\nnow continued: “If I reminded M. de Chalusse of a person whom he had\nformerly loved, that person may have been my mother. I say, MAY HAVE\nBEEN, because I am not certain of it. All my efforts to discover\nthe truth were unavailing. M. de Chalusse seemed to take a malicious\npleasure in destroying all my carefully-arranged theories, and\nin upsetting the conjectures which he had encouraged himself only\ntwenty-four hours previously. Heaven only knows how anxiously I listened\nto his slightest word! And it can be easily understood why I did so. My\nstrange and compromising connection with him drove me nearly frantic.\nIt was not strange that people’s suspicions were aroused. True, he had\nchanged all his servants before my arrival here; but he had requested\nMadame Leon to remain with me, and who can tell what reports she may\nhave circulated? It has often happened that when returning from mass\non Sundays, I have overheard persons say, ‘Look! there is the Count\nde Chalusse’s mistress!’ Oh! not a single humiliation has been spared\nme--not a single one! However, on one point I did not feel the shadow\nof a doubt. The count had known my mother. He frequently alluded to her,\nsometimes with an outburst of passion which made me think that he had\nonce adored, and still loved her; sometimes, with insults and curses\nwhich impressed me with the idea that she had cruelly injured him. But\nmost frequently he reproached her for having unhesitatingly sacrificed\nme to insure her own safety. He said she could have had no heart; and\nthat it was an unheard of, incomprehensible, and monstrous thing that\na woman could enjoy luxury and wealth, undisturbed by remorse, knowing\nthat her innocent and defenceless child was exposed all the while to the\nhardships and temptations of abject poverty. I was also certain that my\nmother was a married woman, for M. de Chalusse alluded to her husband\nmore than once. He hated him with a terrible hatred. One evening, when\nhe was more communicative than usual, he gave me to understand that\nthe great danger he dreaded for me came either from my mother or her\nhusband. He afterward did his best to counteract this impression; but\nhe did not succeed in convincing me that his previous assertion was\nuntrue.”\n\nThe magistrate looked searchingly at Mademoiselle Marguerite. “Then\nthose letters which we found just now in the escritoire are from your\nmother, mademoiselle?” he remarked.\n\nThe girl blushed. She had previously been questioned respecting these\nletters, and she had then made no reply. Now, she hesitated for a\nmoment, and then quietly said: “Your opinion coincides with mine,\nmonsieur.”\n\nThereupon, as if she wished to avoid any further questioning on the\nsubject, she hurriedly continued: “At last a new and even greater\ntrouble came--a positive calamity, which made me forget the disgrace\nattached to my birth. One morning at breakfast, about a month ago, the\ncount informed me that he expected two guests to dinner that evening.\nThis was such an unusual occurrence that I was struck speechless with\nastonishment. ‘It is extraordinary, I admit,’ he added, gayly; ‘but it\nis nevertheless true. M. de Fondege and the Marquis de Valorsay will\ndine here this evening. So, my dear Marguerite, look your prettiest\nin honor of our old friend.’ At six o’clock the two gentlemen arrived\ntogether. I was well acquainted with M. de Fondege--the general, as he\nwas commonly called. He was the count’s only intimate friend, and often\nvisited us. But I had never before seen the Marquis de Valorsay, nor had\nI ever heard his name until M. de Chalusse mentioned it that morning. I\ndon’t pretend to judge him. I will only say that as soon as I saw him,\nthe dislike I felt for him bordered on aversion. My false position\nrendered his close scrutiny actually painful to me, and his attentions\nand compliments pleased me no better. At dinner he addressed his\nconversation exclusively to me, and I particularly remember a certain\npicture he drew of a model household, which positively disgusted me. In\nhis opinion, a husband ought to content himself with being his wife’s\nprime minister--the slave of her slightest caprice. He intended, if\nhe married, to allow the Marquise de Valorsay perfect freedom, with\nan unlimited amount of money, the handsomest carriages, and the most\nmagnificent diamonds in Paris--everything, indeed, that could gratify\nher vanity, and render her existence a fairylike dream. ‘With such ideas\non her husband’s part the marchioness will be very difficult to please\nif she is not contented with her lot,’ he added, glancing covertly at\nme. This exasperated me beyond endurance, and I dryly replied: ‘The mere\nthought of such a husband would drive me to the shelter of a convent.’\nHe seemed considerably disconcerted; and I noticed that the general, I\nmean M. de Fondege, gave him a mischievous look.\n\n“However, when the gentlemen had gone, M. de Chalusse scolded me\nseverely. He said that my sentimental philosophy was quite out of place\nin a drawing-room, and that my ideas of life, marriage, and duty could\nonly have been gained in a foundling asylum. As I attempted to reply, he\ninterrupted me to sound the praises of the Marquis de Valorsay, who\nnot only came of an ancient family, and possessed immense, unencumbered\nestates, but was a talented, handsome man into the bargain; in short,\none of those favored mortals whom all young girls sigh for. The scales\nfell from my eyes. I instantly understood that M. de Chalusse had\nselected the Marquis de Valorsay to be my husband, and thus the marquis\nhad designedly explained his matrimonial programme for my benefit. It\nwas a snare to catch the bird. I felt indignant that he should suppose\nme so wanting in delicacy of feeling and nobility of character as to\nbe dazzled by the life of display and facile pleasure which he had\ndepicted. I had disliked him at first, and now I despised him; for it\nwas impossible to misunderstand the shameless proposal concealed beneath\nhis half-jesting words. He offered me my liberty in exchange for my\nfortune. That is only a fair contract, one might say. Perhaps so; but if\nhe were willing to do this for a certain amount of money, what would\nhe not do for a sum twice or thrice as large? Such were my impressions,\nthough I asked myself again and again if I were not mistaken. No; the\nevents that followed only confirmed my suspicions. Three days later the\nmarquis came again. His visit was to the count, and they held a long\nconference in this study. Having occasion to enter the room, after the\nmarquis’s departure, I noticed on the table a number of title deeds\nwhich he had probably brought for the count’s inspection. On the\nfollowing week there was another conference, and this time a lawyer was\npresent. Any further doubts I might have felt were dispelled by Madame\nLeon, who was always well informed--thanks to her habit of listening\nat the keyholes. ‘They are talking of marrying you to the Marquis de\nValorsay--I heard them,’ she remarked to me.\n\n“However, the information did not terrify me. I had profited by the time\nallowed me for reflection, and I had decided upon the course I should\npursue. I am timid, but I am not weak; and I was determined to resist M.\nde Chalusse’s will in this matter, even if it became necessary for me\nto leave his house, and renounce all hopes of the wealth he had promised\nme. Still I said nothing to Pascal of my mental struggle and final\ndetermination. I did not wish to bind him by the advice which he would\ncertainly have given me. I had his troth, and that sufficed. And it was\nwith a thrill of joy that I said to myself: ‘What does it matter if M.\nde Chalusse should be so angered by my refusal to obey him as to drive\nme from his house? It will rather be so much the better; Pascal will\nprotect me.’\n\n“But resistance is only possible when you are attacked; and M. de\nChalusse did not even allude to the subject--perhaps because affairs\nhad not yet been satisfactorily arranged between the marquis and\nhimself--possibly because he wished to deprive me of the power to oppose\nhim by taking me unawares. It would have been great imprudence on\nmy part to broach the subject myself, and so I waited calmly and\nresignedly, storing up all my energy for the decisive hour. I willingly\nconfess that I am not a heroine of romance--I do not look upon\nmoney with the contempt it deserves. I was resolved to wed solely in\naccordance with the dictates of my heart; but I wished, and HOPED, that\nM. de Chalusse would give me, not a fortune, but a modest dowry. He had\nbecome more communicative than usual on money matters, and took no pains\nto conceal the fact that he was engaged in raising the largest possible\namount of ready cash. He received frequent visits from his stockbroker,\nand sometimes when the latter had left him, he showed me rolls of\nbank-notes and packages of bonds, saying, as he did so: ‘You see that\nyour future is assured, my dear Marguerite.’\n\n“I am only doing the count justice when I say that my future was a\nsubject of constant anxiety to him during the last few months of his\nlife. Less than a fortnight after he had taken me from the asylum, he\ndrew up a will, in which he adopted me and made me his sole legatee. But\nhe afterward destroyed this document on the plea that it did not afford\nme sufficient security; and a dozen others shared the same fate. For his\nmind was constantly occupied with the subject, and he seemed to have a\npresentiment that his death would be a sudden one. I am forced to\nadmit that he seemed less anxious to endow me with his fortune than to\nfrustrate the hopes of some persons I did not know. When he burned his\nlast will in my presence, he remarked: ‘This document is useless: they\nwould contest it, and probably succeed in having it set aside. I have\nthought of a better way; I have found an expedient which will provide\nfor all emergencies.’ And as I ventured some timid objection--for it was\nrepugnant to my sense of honor to act as an instrument of vengeance or\ninjustice, or assist, even passively, in despoiling any person of his\nrightful inheritance--he harshly, almost brutally, replied: ‘Mind\nyour own business! I will disappoint the folks who are waiting for my\nproperty as they deserve to be disappointed. They covet my estates do\nthey! Very well, they shall have them. I will leave them my property,\nbut they shall find it mortgaged to its full value.’\n\n“Unfortunate man! all his plans have failed. The heirs whom he hated so\nbitterly, and whom I don’t even know, whose existence people have not\neven suspected, can now come, and they will find the wealth he was\ndetermined to deprive them of intact. He dreamed of a brilliant destiny\nfor me--a proud name, and the rank of a marchioness--and he has not even\nsucceeded in protecting me from the most shameful insults. I have been\naccused of theft before his body was even cold. He wished to make\nme rich, frightfully rich, and he has not left me enough to buy my\nbread--literally, not enough to buy bread. He was in constant terror\nconcerning my safety, and he died without even telling me what were\nthe mysterious dangers which threatened me; without even telling me\nsomething which I am morally certain of--that he was my father. He\nraised me against my will to the highest social position--he placed that\nwonderful talisman, gold, in my hand; he showed me the world at my feet;\nand suddenly he allowed me to fall even to lower depths of misery than\nthose in which he found me. Ah! M. de Chalusse, it would have been far\nbetter for me if you had left me in the foundling asylum to have earned\nmy own bread. And yet, I freely forgive you.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite reflected for a moment, questioning her memory\nto ascertain if she had told everything--if she had forgotten any\nparticulars of importance. And as it seemed to her that she had nothing\nmore to add, she approached the magistrate, and, with impressive\nsolemnity of tone and manner, exclaimed: “My life up to the present hour\nis now as well known to you as it is to myself. You know what even the\nfriend, who is my only hope, does not know as yet. And now, when I tell\nhim what I really am, will he think me unworthy of him?”\n\nThe magistrate sprang to his feet, impelled by an irresistible force.\nTwo big tears, the first he had shed for years, trembled on his\neyelashes, and coursed down his furrowed cheeks. “You are a noble\ncreature, my child,” he replied, in a voice faltering with emotion; “and\nif I had a son, I should deem myself fortunate if he chose a wife like\nyou.”\n\nShe clasped her hands, with a gesture of intense joy and relief, and\nthen sank into an arm-chair, murmuring: “Oh, thanks, monsieur, thanks!”\n For she was thinking of Pascal; and she had feared he might shrink from\nher when she fully revealed to him her wretched, sorrowful past, of\nwhich he was entirely ignorant. But the magistrate’s words had reassured\nher.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nThe clock on the mantel-shelf struck half-past four. The magistrate and\nMademoiselle Marguerite could hear stealthy footsteps in the hall, and\na rustling near the door. The servants were prowling round about the\nstudy, wondering what was the reason of this prolonged conference. “I\nmust see how the clerk is progressing with the inventory.” said the\nmagistrate. “Excuse me if I absent myself for a moment; I will soon\nreturn.” And so saying he rose and left the room.\n\nBut it was only a pretext. He really wished to conceal his emotion\nand regain his composure, for he had been deeply affected by the young\ngirl’s narrative. He also needed time for reflection, for the situation\nhad become extremely complicated since Mademoiselle Marguerite had\ninformed him of the existence of heirs--of those mysterious enemies who\nhad poisoned the count’s peace. These persons would, of course, require\nto know what had become of the millions deposited in the escritoire,\nand who would be held accountable for the missing treasure? Mademoiselle\nMarguerite, unquestionably. Such were the thoughts that flitted through\nthe magistrate’s mind as he listened to his clerk’s report. Nor was this\nall; for having solicited Mademoiselle Marguerite’s confidence, he must\nnow advise her. And this was a matter of some difficulty.\n\nHowever, when he returned to the study he was quite self-possessed\nand impassive again, and he was pleased to see that on her side the\nunfortunate girl had, to some extent, at least, recovered her wonted\ncomposure. “Let us now discuss the situation calmly,” he began. “I shall\nconvince you that your prospects are not so frightful as you imagine.\nBut before speaking of the future, will you allow me to refer to the\npast?” The girl bowed her consent. “Let us first of all consider the\nsubject of the missing millions. They were certainly in the escritoire\nwhen M. de Chalusse replaced the vial; but now they are not to be found,\nso that the count must have taken them away with him.”\n\n“That thought occurred to me also.”\n\n“Did the treasure form a large package?”\n\n“Yes, it was large; but it could have been easily concealed under the\ncloak which M. de Chalusse wore.”\n\n“Very good! What was the time when he left the house?”\n\n“About five o’clock.”\n\n“When was he brought back?”\n\n“At about half-past six.”\n\n“Where did the cabman pick him up?”\n\n“Near the church of Notre Dame de Lorette, so he told me.”\n\n“Do you know the driver’s number?”\n\n“Casimir asked him for it, I believe.”\n\nHad any one inquired the reason of this semi-official examination, the\nmagistrate would have replied that Mademoiselle Marguerite’s interests\nalone influenced him in the course he was taking. This was quite true;\nand yet, without being altogether conscious of the fact, he was also\nimpelled by another motive. This affair interested, almost fascinated,\nhim on account of its mysterious surroundings, and influenced by the\ndesire for arriving at the truth which is inherent in every human heart,\nhe was anxious to solve the riddle. After a few moments’ thoughtful\nsilence, he remarked: “So the point of departure in our investigation,\nif there is an investigation, will be this: M. de Chalusse left the\nhouse with two millions in his possession; and while he was absent, he\neither disposed of that enormous sum--or else it was stolen from him.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite shuddered. “Oh! stolen,” she faltered.\n\n“Yes, my child--anything is possible. We must consider the situation in\nevery possible light. But to continue. Where was M. de Chalusse going?”\n\n“To the house of a gentleman who would, he thought, be able to furnish\nthe address given in the letter he had torn up.”\n\n“What was this gentleman’s name?”\n\n“Fortunat.”\n\nThe magistrate wrote the name down on his tablets, and then, resuming\nhis examination, he said: “Now, in reference to this unfortunate letter\nwhich, in your opinion, was the cause of the count’s death, what did it\nsay?”\n\n“I don’t know, monsieur. It is true that I helped the count in\ncollecting the fragments, but I did not read what was written on them.”\n\n“That is of little account. The main thing is to ascertain who wrote\nthe letter. You told me that it could only have come from the sister who\ndisappeared thirty years ago, or else from your mother.”\n\n“That was, and still is, my opinion.”\n\nThe magistrate toyed with his ring; and a smile of satisfaction stole\nover his face. “Very well!” he exclaimed, “in less than five minutes\nI shall be able to tell you whether the letter was from your mother\nor not. My method is perfectly simple. I have only to compare the\nhandwriting with that of the letters found in the escritoire.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite sprang up, exclaiming: “What a happy idea!”\n\nBut without seeming to notice the girl’s surprise, he added: “Where are\nthe remnants of this letter which you and the count picked up in the\ngarden?”\n\n“M. de Chalusse placed them in his pocket.”\n\n“They must be found. Tell the count’s valet to look for them.”\n\nThe girl rang; but M. Casimir, who was supposed to be engaged in making\npreparations for the funeral, was not in the house. However, another\nservant and Madame Leon offered their services, and certainly displayed\nthe most laudable zeal, but their search was fruitless; the fragments\nof the letter could not be found. “How unfortunate!” muttered the\nmagistrate, as he watched them turn the pockets of the count’s clothes\ninside out. “What a fatality! That letter would probably have solved the\nmystery.”\n\nCompelled to submit to this disappointment, he returned to the study;\nbut he was evidently discouraged. Although he did not consider the\nmystery insoluble, far from it, he realized that time and research\nwould be required to arrive at a solution, and that the affair was quite\nbeyond his province. One hope alone remained.\n\nBy carefully studying the last words which M. de Chalusse had written\nand spoken he might arrive at the intention which had dictated them.\nExperience had wonderfully sharpened his penetration, and perhaps he\nmight discover a hidden meaning which would throw light upon all this\ndoubt and uncertainty. Accordingly, he asked Mademoiselle Marguerite for\nthe paper upon which the count had endeavored to pen his last wishes;\nand in addition he requested her to write on a card the dying man’s last\nwords in the order they had been uttered. But on combining the written\nand the spoken words the only result obtained was as follows:--“My\nentire fortune--give--friends--against--Marguerite--despoiled--your\nmother--take care.” These twelve incoherent words revealed the count’s\nabsorbing and poignant anxiety concerning his fortune and Marguerite’s\nfuture, and also the fear and aversion with which Marguerite’s mother\ninspired him. But that was all; the sense was not precise enough for any\npractical purpose. Certainly the word “give” needed no explanation.\nIt was plain that the count had endeavored to write, “I give my entire\nfortune.” The meaning of the word “despoiled” was also clear. It had\nevidently been wrung from the half-unconscious man by the horrible\nthought that Marguerite--his own daughter, unquestionably--would not\nhave a penny of all the millions he had intended for her. “Take care”\n also explained itself. But there were two words which seemed absolutely\nincomprehensible to the magistrate, and which he vainly strove to\nconnect with the others in an intelligible manner. These were the words\n“friends” and “against,” and they were the most legibly written of\nall. For the thirtieth time the magistrate was repeating them in an\nundertone, when a rap came at the door, and almost immediately Madame\nLeon entered the room.\n\n“What is it?” inquired Mademoiselle Marguerite.\n\nLaying a package of letters, addressed to M. de Chalusse, on the desk,\nthe housekeeper replied: “These have just come by the post for the\npoor count. Heaven rest his soul!” And then handing a newspaper to\nMademoiselle Marguerite, she added, in an unctuous tone: “And some one\nleft this paper for mademoiselle at the same time.”\n\n“This paper--for me? You must be mistaken.”\n\n“Not at all. I was in the concierge’s lodge when the messenger brought\nit; and he said it was for Mademoiselle Marguerite, from one of her\nfriends.” And with these words she made one of her very best courtesies,\nand withdrew.\n\nThe girl had taken the newspaper, and now, with an air of astonishment\nand apprehension, she slowly unfolded it. What first attracted her\nattention was a paragraph on the first page marked round with red chalk.\nThe paper had evidently been sent in order that she might read this\nparticular passage, and accordingly she began to peruse it. “There was a\ngreat sensation and a terrible scandal last evening at the residence of\nMadame d’A----, a well known star of the first magnitude----”\n\nIt was the shameful article which described the events that had robbed\nPascal of his honor. And to make assurance doubly sure, to prevent the\nleast mistake concerning the printed initials, the coward who sent the\npaper had appended the names of the persons mixed up in the affair, at\nfull length, in pencil. He had written d’Argeles, Pascal Ferailleur,\nFerdinand de Coralth, Rochecote. And yet, in spite of these precautions,\nthe girl did not at first seize the full meaning of the article; and\nshe was obliged to read it over again. But when she finally understood\nit--when the horrible truth burst upon her--the paper fell from her\nnerveless hands, she turned as pale as death, and, gasping for breath,\nleaned heavily against the wall for support.\n\nHer features expressed such terrible suffering that the magistrate\nsprang from his chair with a bound. “What has happened?” he eagerly\nasked.\n\nShe tried to reply, but finding herself unable to do so, she pointed to\nthe paper lying upon the floor, and gasped: “There! there!”\n\nThe magistrate understood everything at the first glance; and this man,\nwho had witnessed so much misery--who had been the confidant of so many\nmartyrs--was filled with consternation at thought of the misfortunes\nwhich destiny was heaping upon this defenceless girl. He approached her,\nand led her gently to an arm-chair, upon which she sank, half fainting.\n“Poor child!” he murmured. “The man you had chosen--the man whom you\nwould have sacrificed everything for--is Pascal Ferailleur, is he not?”\n\n“Yes, it is he.”\n\n“He is an advocate?”\n\n“As I have already told you, monsieur.”\n\n“Does he live in the Rue d’Ulm?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nThe magistrate shook his head sadly. “It is the same,” said he. “I also\nknow him, my poor child; and I loved and honored him. Yesterday I should\nhave told you that he was worthy of you. He was above slander. But now,\nsee what depths love of play has brought him to. He is a thief!”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite’s weakness vanished. She sprang from her\nchair, and indignantly faced the magistrate. “It is false!” she cried,\nvehemently; “and what that paper says is false as well!”\n\nHad her reason been affected by so many successive blows? It seemed\nlikely; for, livid a moment before, her face had now turned scarlet. She\ntrembled nervously from head to foot, and there was a gleam of insanity\nin her big black eyes.\n\n“If she doesn’t weep, she is lost,” thought the magistrate. And, instead\nof encouraging her to hope, he deemed it best to try and destroy what he\nconsidered a dangerous illusion. “Alas! my poor child,” he said sadly,\n“you must not deceive yourself. The newspapers are often hasty in their\njudgment; but an article like that is only published when proof of its\ntruth is furnished by witnesses of unimpeachable veracity.”\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders as if she were listening to some monstrous\nabsurdities, and then thoughtfully muttered: “Ah! now Pascal’s silence\nis explained: now I understand why he has not yet replied to the letter\nI wrote him last night.”\n\nThe magistrate persevered, however, and added: “So, after the article\nyou have just read, no one can entertain the shadow of a doubt.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite hastily interrupted him. “But I have not doubted\nhim for a second!” she exclaimed. “Doubt Pascal! I doubt Pascal! I would\nsooner doubt myself. I might commit a dishonorable act; I am only a\npoor, weak, ignorant girl, while he--he----You don’t know, then, that\nhe was my conscience? Before undertaking anything, before deciding upon\nanything, if ever I felt any doubt, I asked myself, ‘What would he do?’\nAnd the mere thought of him is sufficient to banish any unworthy idea\nfrom my heart.” Her tone and manner betokened complete and unwavering\nconfidence; and her faith imparted an almost sublime expression to her\nface. “If I was overcome, monsieur,” she continued, “it was only because\nI was appalled by the audacity of the accusation. How was it possible to\nmake Pascal even SEEM to be guilty of a dishonorable act? This is beyond\nmy powers of comprehension. I am only certain of one thing--that he is\ninnocent. If the whole world rose to testify against him, it would not\nshake my faith in him, and even if he confessed that he was guilty I\nshould be more likely to believe that he was crazed than culpable!”\n\nA bitter smile curved her lips, she was beginning to judge the situation\nmore correctly, and in a calmer tone she resumed: “Moreover, what does\ncircumstantial evidence prove? Did you not this morning hear all our\nservants declaring that I was accountable for M. de Chalusse’s\nmillions? Who knows what might have happened if it had not been for your\nintervention? Perhaps, by this time, I should have been in prison.”\n\n“This is not a parallel case, my child.”\n\n“It IS a parallel case, monsieur. Suppose, for one moment, that I had\nbeen formally accused--what do you think Pascal would have replied if\npeople had gone to him, and said, ‘Marguerite is a thief?’ He would have\nlaughed them to scorn, and have exclaimed, ‘Impossible!”’\n\nThe magistrate’s mind was made up. In his opinion, Pascal Ferailleur was\nguilty. Still it was useless to argue with the girl, for he felt that he\nshould not be able to convince her. However, he determined, if possible,\nto ascertain her plans in order to oppose them, if they seemed to him at\nall dangerous. “Perhaps you are right, my child,” he conceded, “still,\nthis unfortunate affair must change all your arrangements.”\n\n“Rather, it modifies them.” Surprised by her calmness, he looked at her\ninquiringly. “An hour ago,” she added, “I had resolved to go to Pascal\nand claim his aid and protection as one claims an undeniable right or\nthe fulfilment of a solemn promise; but now--”\n\n“Well?” eagerly asked the magistrate.\n\n“I am still resolved to go to him--but as an humble suppliant. And I\nshall say to him, ‘You are suffering, but no sorrow is intolerable when\nthere are two to bear the burden; and so, here I am. Everything else\nmay fail you--your dearest friends may basely desert you; but here am I.\nWhatever your plans may be--whether you have decided to leave Europe or\nto remain in Paris to watch for your hour of vengeance, you will need\na faithful, trusty companion--a confidant--and here I am! Wife,\nfriend, sister--I will be which ever you desire. I am yours--yours\nunconditionally.’” And as if in reply to a gesture of surprise which\nescaped the magistrate, she added: “He is unhappy--I am free--I love\nhim!”\n\nThe magistrate was struck dumb with astonishment. He knew that she\nwould surely do what she said; he had realized that she was one of those\ngenerous, heroic women who are capable of any sacrifice for the man they\nlove--a woman who would never shrink from what she considered to be\nher duty, who was utterly incapable of weak hesitancy or selfish\ncalculation.\n\n“Fortunately, my dear young lady, your devotion will no doubt be\nuseless,” he said at last.\n\n“And why?”\n\n“Because M. Ferailleur owes it to you, and, what is more, he owes it\nto himself, not to accept such a sacrifice.” Failing to understand his\nmeaning, she looked at him inquiringly. “You will forgive me, I trust,”\n he continued, “if I warn you to prepare for a disappointment. Innocent\nor guilty, M. Ferailleur is--disgraced. Unless something little short of\na miracle comes to help him, his career is ended. This is one of those\ncharges--one of those slanders, if you prefer that term, which a man can\nnever shake off. So how can you hope that he will consent to link your\ndestiny to his?”\n\nShe had not thought of this objection, and it seemed to her a terrible\none. Tears came to her dark eyes, and in a despondent voice she\nmurmured: “God grant that he will not evince such cruel generosity. The\nonly great and true misfortune that could strike me now would be to have\nhim repel me. M. de Chalusse’s death leaves me without means--without\nbread; but now I can almost bless my poverty since it enables me to ask\nhim what would become of me if he abandoned me, and who would protect me\nif he refused to do so. The brilliant career he dreamed of is ended, you\nsay. Ah, well! I will console him, and though we are unfortunate, we\nmay yet be happy. Our enemies are triumphant--so be it: we should only\ntarnish our honor by stooping to contend against such villainy. But in\nsome new land, in America, perhaps, we shall be able to find some\nquiet spot where we can begin a new and better career.” It was almost\nimpossible to believe that it was Mademoiselle Marguerite, usually so\nhaughtily reserved, who was now speaking with such passionate vehemence.\nAnd to whom was she talking in this fashion? To a stranger, whom she saw\nfor the first time. But she was urged on by circumstances, the influence\nof which was stronger than her own will. They had led her to reveal her\ndearest and most sacred feelings and to display her real nature free\nfrom any kind of disguise.\n\nHowever, the magistrate concealed the emotion and sympathy which filled\nhis heart and refused to admit that the girl’s hopes were likely to be\nrealized. “And if M. Ferailleur refused to accept your sacrifice?” he\nasked.\n\n“It is not a sacrifice, monsieur.”\n\n“No matter; but supposing he refused it, what should you do?”\n\n“What should I do?” she muttered. “I don’t know. Still I should have\nno difficulty in earning a livelihood. I have been told that I have a\nremarkable voice. I might, perhaps, go upon the stage.”\n\nThe magistrate sprang from his arm-chair. “You become an actress, YOU?”\n\n“Under such circumstances it would little matter what became of me!”\n\n“But you don’t suspect--you cannot imagine----”\n\nHe was at a loss for words to explain the nature of his objections to\nsuch a career; and it was Mademoiselle Marguerite who found them for\nhim. “I suspect that theatrical life is an abominable life for a woman,”\n she said, gravely; “but I know that there are many noble and chaste\nwomen who have adopted the profession. That is enough for me. My pride\nis a sufficient protection. It preserved me as an apprentice; it would\npreserve me as an actress. I might be slandered; but that is not an\nirremediable misfortune. I despise the world too much to be troubled by\nits opinion so long as I have the approval of my own conscience. And\nwhy should I not become a great artiste if I consecrated all the\nintelligence, passion, energy, and will I might possess, to my art?”\n\nHearing a knock at the door she paused; and a moment later a footman\nentered with lights, for night was falling. He was closely followed by\nanother servant, who said: “Mademoiselle, the Marquis de Valorsay is\nbelow, and wishes to know if mademoiselle will grant him the honor of an\ninterview.”\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nOn hearing M. de Valorsay’s name, Mademoiselle Marguerite and the\nmagistrate exchanged glances full of wondering conjecture. The girl was\nundecided what course to pursue; but the magistrate put an end to her\nperplexity. “Ask the marquis to come up,” he said to the servant.\n\nThe footman left the room; and, as soon as he had disappeared,\nMademoiselle Marguerite exclaimed: “What, monsieur! after all I have\ntold you, you still wish me to receive him?”\n\n“It is absolutely necessary that you should do so. You must know what\nhe wishes and what hope brings him here. Calm yourself, and submit to\nnecessity.”\n\nIn a sort of bewilderment, the girl hastily arranged her disordered\ndress, and caught up her wavy hair which had fallen over her shoulders.\n“Ah! monsieur,” she remarked, “don’t you understand that he still\nbelieves me to be the count’s heiress? In his eyes, I am still\nsurrounded by the glamor of the millions which are mine no longer.”\n\n“Hush! here he comes!”\n\nThe Marquis de Valorsay was indeed upon the threshold, and a moment\nlater he entered the room. He was clad with the exquisite taste of\nthose intelligent gentlemen to whom the color of a pair of trousers is\na momentous matter, and whose ambition is satisfied if they are regarded\nas a sovereign authority respecting the cut of a waistcoat. As a rule,\nhis expression of face merely denoted supreme contentment with himself\nand indifference as to others, but now, strange to say, he looked grave\nand almost solemn. His right leg--the unfortunate limb which had been\nbroken when he fell from his horse in Ireland--seemed stiff, and dragged\na trifle more than usual, but this was probably solely due to the\ninfluence of the atmosphere. He bowed to Mademoiselle Marguerite with\nevery mark of profound respect, and without seeming to notice the\nmagistrate’s presence.\n\n“You will excuse me, I trust, mademoiselle,” said he, “in having\ninsisted upon seeing you, so that I might express my deep sympathy. I\nhave just heard of the terrible misfortune which has befallen you--the\nsudden death of your father.”\n\nShe drew back as if she were terrified, and repeated: “My father!”\n\nThe marquis did not evince the slightest surprise. “I know,” said he, in\na voice which he tried to make as feeling as possible, “I know that\nM. de Chalusse kept this fact concealed from you; but he confided his\nsecret to me.”\n\n“To you?” interrupted the magistrate, who was unable to restrain himself\nany longer.\n\nThe marquis turned haughtily to this old man dressed in black, and in\nthe dry tone one uses in speaking to an indiscreet inferior, he replied:\n“To me, yes, monsieur; and he acquainted me not only by word of mouth,\nbut in writing also, with the motives which influenced him, expressing\nhis fixed intention, not only of recognizing Mademoiselle Marguerite as\nhis daughter, but also of adopting her in order to insure her undisputed\nright to his fortune and his name.”\n\n“Ah!” said the magistrate as if suddenly enlightened; “ah! ah!”\n\nBut without noticing this exclamation which was, at least, remarkable\nin tone, M. de Valorsay again turned to Mademoiselle Marguerite, and\ncontinued: “Your ignorance on this subject, mademoiselle, convinces\nme that your servants have not deceived me in telling me that M. de\nChalusse was struck down without the slightest warning. But they have\ntold me one thing which I cannot believe. They have told me that the\ncount made no provision for you, that he left no will, and that--excuse\na liberty which is prompted only by the most respectful interest--and\nthat, the result of this incomprehensible and culpable neglect is that\nyou are ruined and almost without means. Can this be possible?”\n\n“It is the exact truth, monsieur,” replied Mademoiselle Marguerite. “I\nam reduced to the necessity of working for my daily bread.”\n\nShe spoke these words with a sort of satisfaction, expecting that the\nmarquis would betray his disappointed covetousness by some significant\ngesture or exclamation, and she was already prepared to rejoice at his\nconfusion. But her expectations were not realized. Instead of evincing\nthe slightest dismay or even regret, M. de Valorsay drew a long breath,\nas if a great burden had been lifted from his heart, and his eyes\nsparkled with apparent delight. “Then I may venture to speak,” he\nexclaimed, with unconcealed satisfaction, “I will speak, mademoiselle,\nif you will deign to allow me.”\n\nShe looked at him with anxious curiosity, wondering what was to come.\n“Speak, monsieur,” she faltered.\n\n“I will obey you, mademoiselle,” he said, bowing again. “But first,\nallow me to tell you how great my hopes have been. M. de Chalusse’s\ndeath is an irreparable misfortune for me as for yourself. He had\nallowed me, mademoiselle, to aspire to the honor of becoming a suitor\nfor your hand. If he did not speak to you on the subject, it was only\nbecause he wished to leave you absolutely free, and impose upon me\nthe difficult task of winning your consent. But between him and me\neverything had been arranged in principle, and he was to give a dowry\nof three millions of francs to Mademoiselle Marguerite de Chalusse, his\ndaughter.”\n\n“I am no longer Mademoiselle de Chalusse, Monsieur le Marquis, and I am\nno longer the possessor of a fortune.”\n\nHe felt the sharp sting of this retort, for the blood rose to his\ncheeks, still he did not lose his composure. “If you were still rich,\nmademoiselle,” he replied, in the reproachful tone of an honest man who\nfeels that he is misunderstood, “I should, perhaps, have strength to\nkeep the sentiments with which you have inspired me a secret in my own\nheart; but--” He rose, and with a gesture which was not devoid of\ngrace, and in a full ringing voice he added: “But you are no longer the\npossessor of millions; and so I may tell you, Mademoiselle Marguerite,\nthat I love you. Will you be my wife?”\n\nThe poor girl was obliged to exercise all her powers of self-control to\nrestrain an exclamation of dismay. It was indeed more than dismay;\nshe was absolutely terrified by the Marquis de Valorsay’s unexpected\ndeclaration, and she could only falter: “Monsieur! monsieur!”\n\nBut with an air of winning frankness he continued: “Need I tell you who\nI am, mademoiselle? No; that is unnecessary. The fact that my suit was\napproved of by M. de Chalusse is the best recommendation I can offer\nyou. The pure and stainless name I bear is one of the proudest in\nFrance; and though my fortune may have been somewhat impaired by\nyouthful folly, it is still more than sufficient to maintain an\nestablishment in keeping with my rank.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite was still powerless to reply. Her presence of\nmind had entirely deserted her, and her tongue seemed to cleave to her\npalate. She glanced entreatingly at the old magistrate, as if imploring\nhis intervention, but he was so absorbed in contemplating his wonderful\nring, that one might have imagined he was oblivious of all that was\ngoing on around him.\n\n“I am aware that I have so far not been fortunate enough to please you,\nmademoiselle,” continued the marquis. “M. de Chalusse did not conceal it\nfrom me--I remember, alas! that I advocated in your presence a number\nof stupid theories, which must have given you a very poor opinion of me.\nBut you will forgive me, I trust. My ideas have entirely changed since\nI have learned to understand and appreciate your vigorous intellect and\nnobility of soul. I thoughtlessly spoke to you in the language which\nis usually addressed to young ladies of our rank of life--frivolous\nbeauties, who are spoiled by vanity and luxury, and who look upon\nmarriage only as a means of enfranchisement.”\n\nHis words were disjointed as if emotion choked his utterance. At times,\nit seemed as if he could scarcely command his feelings; and then his\nvoice became so faint and trembling that it was scarcely intelligible.\n\nHowever, by allowing him to continue, by listening to what he said,\nMademoiselle Marguerite was encouraging him, even more--virtually\nbinding herself. She understood that this was the case, and making a\npowerful effort, she interrupted him, saying: “I assure you, Monsieur\nle Marquis, that I am deeply touched--and grateful--but I am no longer\nfree.”\n\n“Pray, mademoiselle, pray do not reply to-day. Grant me a little time to\novercome your prejudices.”\n\nShe shook her head, and in a firmer voice, replied: “I have no\nprejudices; but for some time past already, my future has been decided,\nirrevocably decided.”\n\nHe seemed thunderstruck, and his manner apparently indicated that the\npossibility of a repulse had never entered his mind. His eyes wandered\nrestlessly from Mademoiselle Marguerite to the countenance of the old\nmagistrate, who remained as impassive as a sphinx, and at last they\nlighted on a newspaper which was lying on the floor at the young girl’s\nfeet. “Do not deprive me of all hope,” he murmured.\n\nShe made no answer, and understanding her silence, he was about to\nretire when the door suddenly opened and a servant announced: “Monsieur\nde Fondege.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite touched the magistrate on the shoulder to\nattract his attention. “This gentleman is M. de Chalusse’s friend whom I\nsent for this morning.”\n\nAt the same moment a man who looked some sixty years of age entered the\nroom. He was very tall, and as straight as the letter I, being arrayed\nin a long blue frock-coat, while his neck, which was as red and as\nwrinkled as that of a turkey-cock, was encased in a very high and stiff\nsatin cravat. On seeing his ruddy face, his closely cropped hair, his\nlittle eyes twinkling under his bushy eyebrows, and his formidable\nmustaches a la Victor Emmanuel, you would have immediately exclaimed:\n“That man is an old soldier!”\n\nA great mistake! M. de Fondege had never been in the service, and it was\nonly in mockery of his somewhat bellicose manners and appearance that\nsome twenty years previously his friends had dubbed him “the General.”\n However, the appellation had clung to him. The nickname had been changed\nto a title, and now M. de Fondege was known as “the General” everywhere.\nHe was invited and announced as “the General.” Many people believed that\nhe had really been one, and perhaps he fancied so himself, for he had\nlong been in the habit of inscribing “General A. de Fondege” on his\nvisiting cards. The nickname had had a decisive influence on his life.\nHe had endeavored to show himself worthy of it, and the manners he had\nat first assumed, eventually became natural ones. He seemed to be the\nconventional old soldier--irascible and jovial at the same time; brusk\nand kind; at once frank, sensible and brutal; as simple as a child, and\nyet as true as steel. He swore the most tremendous oaths in a deep bass\nvoice, and whenever he talked his arms revolved like the sails of a\nwindmill. However, Madame de Fondege, who was a very angular lady, with\na sharp nose and very thin lips, assured people that her husband was not\nso terrible as he appeared. He was not considered very shrewd, and he\npretended to have an intense dislike for business matters. No one knew\nanything precise about his fortune, but he had a great many friends\nwho invited him to dinner, and they all declared that he was in very\ncomfortable circumstances.\n\nOn entering the study this worthy man did not pay the slightest\nattention to the Marquis de Valorsay, although they were intimate\nfriends. He walked straight up to Mademoiselle Marguerite, caught her in\nhis long arms, and pressed her to his heart, brushing her face with\nhis huge mustaches as he pretended to kiss her. “Courage, my dear,” he\ngrowled; “courage. Don’t give way. Follow my example. Look at me!”\n So saying he stepped back, and it was really amusing to see the\nextraordinary effort he made to combine a soldier’s stoicism with a\nfriend’s sorrow. “You must wonder at my delay, my dear,” he resumed,\n“but it was not my fault. I was at Madame de Rochecote’s when I was\ninformed that your messenger was at home waiting for me. I returned,\nand heard the frightful news. It was a thunderbolt. A friend of thirty\nyears’ standing! A thousand thunderclaps! I acted as his second when he\nfought his first duel. Poor Chalusse! A man as sturdy as an oak, and who\nought to have outlived us all. But it is always so; the best soldiers\nalways file by first at dress-parade.”\n\nThe Marquis de Valorsay had beaten a retreat, the magistrate was hidden\nin a dark corner, and Mademoiselle Marguerite, who was accustomed to the\nGeneral’s manner, remained silent, being well aware that there was no\nchance of putting in a word as long as he had possession of the floor.\n“Fortunately, poor Chalusse was a prudent man,” continued M. de Fondege.\n“He loved you devotedly, my dear, as his testamentary provisions must\nhave shown you.”\n\n“His provisions?”\n\n“Yes, most certainly. Surely you don’t mean to try and conceal anything\nfrom one who knows all. Ah! you will be one of the greatest catches in\nEurope, and you will have plenty of suitors.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite sadly shook her head. “You are mistaken,\nGeneral; the count left no will, and has made no provision whatever for\nme.”\n\nM. de Fondege trembled, turned a trifle pale, and in a faltering voice,\nexclaimed: “What! You tell me that? Chalusse! A thousand thunderclaps!\nIt isn’t possible.”\n\n“The count was stricken with apoplexy in a cab. He went out about\nfive o’clock, on foot, and a little before seven he was brought home\nunconscious. Where he had been we don’t know.”\n\n“You don’t know? you don’t know?”\n\n“Alas! no; and he was only able to utter a few incoherent words before\nhe died.” Thereupon the poor girl began a brief account of what had\ntaken place during the last four-and-twenty hours. Had she been less\nabsorbed in her narrative she would have noticed that the General was\nnot listening to her. He was sitting at the count’s desk and was toying\nwith the letters which Madame Leon had brought into the room a short\ntime previously. One of them especially seemed to attract his attention,\nto exercise a sort of fascination over him as it were. He looked at\nit with hungry eyes, and whenever he touched it, his hand trembled, or\ninvoluntarily clinched. His face, moreover, had become livid; his eyes\ntwitched nervously; he seemed to have a difficulty in breathing, and big\ndrops of perspiration trickled down his forehead. If the magistrate were\nable to see the General’s face, he must certainly have been of opinion\nthat a terrible conflict was raging in his mind. The struggle lasted\nindeed for fully five minutes, and then suddenly, certain that no one\nsaw him, he caught up the letter in question and slipped it into his\npocket.\n\nPoor Marguerite was now finishing her story: “You see, monsieur, that,\nfar from being an heiress, as you suppose, I am homeless and penniless,”\n she said.\n\nThe General had risen from his chair, and was striding up and down\nthe room with every token of intense agitation. “It’s true,” he said\napparently unconscious of his words. “She’s ruined--lost--the misfortune\nis complete!” Then, suddenly pausing with folded arms in front of\nMademoiselle Marguerite: “What are you going to do?” he asked.\n\n“God will not forsake me, General,” she replied.\n\nHe turned on his heel and resumed his promenade, wildly gesticulating\nand indulging in a furious monologue which was certainly not very easy\nto follow. “Frightful! terrible!” he growled. “The daughter of an old\ncomrade--zounds!--of a friend of thirty years’ standing--to be left in\nsuch a plight! Never, a thousand thunderclaps!--never! Poor child!--a\nheart of gold, and as pretty as an angel! This horrible Paris would\ndevour her at a single mouthful! It would be a crime--an abomination! It\nsha’n’t be!--the old veterans are here, firm as rocks!”\n\nThereupon, approaching the poor girl again, he exclaimed in a coarse but\nseemingly feeling voice: “Mademoiselle Marguerite.”\n\n“General?”\n\n“You are acquainted with my son, Gustave Fondege, are you not?”\n\n“I think I have heard you speak of him to M. de Chalusse several times.”\n\nThe General tugged furiously at his mustaches as was his wont whenever\nhe was perplexed or embarrassed. “My son,” he resumed, “is twenty-seven.\nHe’s now a lieutenant of hussars, and will soon be promoted to the rank\nof captain. He’s a handsome fellow, sure to make his way in the world,\nfor he’s not wanting in spirit. As I never attempt to hide the truth, I\nmust confess that he’s a trifle dissipated; but his heart is all right,\nand a charming little wife would soon turn him from the error of his\nways, and he’d become the pearl of husbands.” He paused, passed his\nforefinger three or four times between his collar and his neck, and\nthen, in a half-strangled voice, he added: “Mademoiselle Marguerite, I\nhave the honor to ask for your hand in marriage on behalf of Lieutenant\nGustave de Fondege, my son.”\n\nThere was a dangerous gleam of anger in Mademoiselle Marguerite’s eyes,\nas she coldly replied: “I am honored by your request, monsieur; but my\nfuture is already decided.”\n\nSome seconds elapsed before M. de Fondege could recover his powers of\nspeech. “This is a piece of foolishness,” he faltered, at last with\nsingular agitation. “Let me hope that you will reconsider the matter.\nAnd if Gustave doesn’t please you, we will find some one better. But\nunder no circumstances will Chalusse’s old comrade ever desert you. I\nshall send Madame de Fondege to see you this evening. She’s a good woman\nand you will understand each other. Come, answer me, what do you say to\nit?”\n\nHis persistence irritated the poor girl beyond endurance, and to put\nan end to the painful scene, she at last asked: “Would you not like to\nlook--for the last time--at M. de Chalusse?”\n\n“Ah! yes, certainly--an old friend of thirty years’ standing.” So saying\nhe advanced toward the door leading into the death-room, but on reaching\nthe threshold, he cried in sudden terror: “Oh! no, no, I could not.” And\nwith these words he withdrew or rather he fled from the room down the\nstairs.\n\nAs long as the General had been there, the magistrate had given no sign\nof life. But seated beyond the circle of light cast by the lamps, he\nhad remained an attentive spectator of the scene, and now that he found\nhimself once more alone with Mademoiselle Marguerite he came forward,\nand leaning against the mantelpiece and looking her full in the face he\nexclaimed: “Well, my child?”\n\nThe girl trembled like a culprit awaiting sentence of death, and it was\nin a hollow voice that she replied: “I understood--”\n\n“What?” insisted the pitiless magistrate.\n\nShe raised her beautiful eyes, in which angry tears were still\nglittering, and then answered in a voice which quivered with suppressed\npassion, “I have fathomed the infamy of those two men who have just left\nthe house. I understood the insult their apparent generosity conceals.\nThey had questioned the servants, and had ascertained that two millions\nwere missing. Ah, the scoundrels! They believe that I have stolen those\nmillions; and they came to ask me to share the ill-gotten wealth with\nthem. What an insult! and to think that I am powerless to avenge it! Ah!\nthe servants’ suspicions were nothing in comparison with this. At\nleast, they did not ask for a share of the booty as the price of their\nsilence!”\n\nThe magistrate shook his head as if this explanation scarcely satisfied\nhim. “There is something else, there is certainly something else,” he\nrepeated. But the doors were still open, so he closed them carefully,\nand then returned to the girl he was so desirous of advising. “I wish\nto tell you,” he said, “that you have mistaken the motives which induced\nthese gentlemen to ask for your hand in marriage.”\n\n“Do you believe, then, that you have fathomed them?”\n\n“I could almost swear that I had. Didn’t you remark a great difference\nin their manner? Didn’t one of them, the marquis, behave with all\nthe calmness and composure which are the result of reflection and\ncalculation? The other, on the contrary, acted most precipitately, as\nif he had suddenly come to a determination, and formed a plan on the\nimpulse of the moment.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite reflected.\n\n“That’s true,” she said, “that’s indeed true. Now I recollect the\ndifference.”\n\n“And this is my explanation of it,” resumed the magistrate. “‘The\nMarquis de Valorsay,’ I said to myself, ‘must have proofs in his\npossession that Mademoiselle Marguerite is the count’s daughter--written\nand conclusive proofs, that is certain--probably a voluntary admission\nof the fact from the father. Who can prove that M. de Valorsay does not\npossess this acknowledgment? In fact, he must possess it. He hinted it\nhimself.’ Accordingly on hearing of the count’s sudden death, he said to\nhimself, ‘If Marguerite was my wife, and if I could prove her to be M.\nde Chalusse’s daughter, I should obtain several millions.’ Whereupon he\nconsulted his legal adviser who assured him that it would be the best\ncourse he could pursue; and so he came here. You repulsed him, but he\nwill soon make another assault, you may rest assured of that. And some\nday or other he will come to you and say, ‘Whether we marry or not, let\nus divide.’”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite was amazed. The magistrate’s words seemed to\ndispel the mist which had hitherto hidden the truth from view. “Yes,”\n she exclaimed, “yes, you are right, monsieur.”\n\nHe was silent for a moment, and then he resumed: “I understand M. de\nFondege’s motive less clearly; but still I have some clue. He had not\nquestioned the servants. That is evident from the fact that on his\narrival here he believed you to be the sole legatee. He was also aware\nthat M. de Chalusse had taken certain precautions we are ignorant of,\nbut which he is no doubt fully acquainted with. What you told him about\nyour poverty amazed him, and he immediately evinced a desire to atone\nfor the count’s neglect with as much eagerness as if he were the cause\nof this negligence himself. And, indeed, judging by the agitation he\ndisplayed when he was imploring you to become his son’s wife, one might\nalmost imagine that the sight of your misery awakened a remorse which he\nwas endeavoring to quiet. Now, draw your own conclusions.”\n\nThe wretched girl looked questioningly at the magistrate as if she\nhesitated to trust the thoughts which his words had awakened in her\nmind. “Then you think, monsieur,” she said, with evident reluctance,\n“you think, you suppose, that the General is acquainted with the\nwhereabouts of the missing millions?”\n\n“Quite correct,” answered the magistrate, and then as if he feared that\nhe had gone too far, he added: “but draw your own conclusions respecting\nthe matter. You have the whole night before you. We will talk it over\nagain to-morrow, and if I can be of service to you in any way, I shall\nbe only too glad.”\n\n“But, monsieur--”\n\n“Oh--to-morrow, to-morrow--I must go to dinner now; besides, my clerk\nmust be getting terribly impatient.”\n\nThe clerk was, indeed, out of temper. Not that he had finished taking\nan inventory of the appurtenances of this immense house, but because he\nconsidered that he had done quite enough work for one day. And yet his\ndiscontent was sensibly diminished when he calculated the amount he\nwould receive for his pains. During the nine years he had held this\noffice he had never made such an extensive inventory before. He seemed\nsomewhat dazzled, and as he followed his superior out of the house, he\nremarked: “Do you know, monsieur, that as nearly as I can discover the\ndeceased’s fortune must amount to more than twenty millions--an income\nof a million a year! And to think that the poor young lady shouldn’t\nhave a penny of it. I suspect she’s crying her eyes out.”\n\nBut the clerk was mistaken. Mademoiselle Marguerite was then questioning\nM. Casimir respecting the arrangements which he had made for the\nfuneral, and when this sad duty was concluded, she consented to take a\nlittle food standing in front of the sideboard in the dining-room.\nThen she went to kneel in the count’s room, where four members of the\nparochial clergy were reciting the prayers for the dead.\n\nShe was so exhausted with fatigue that she could scarcely speak, and\nher eyelids were heavy with sleep. But she had another task to fulfil, a\ntask which she deemed a sacred duty. She sent a servant for a cab, threw\na shawl over her shoulders, and left the house accompanied by Madame\nLeon. The cabman drove as fast as possible to the house where Pascal and\nhis mother resided in the Rue d’Ulm; but on arriving there, the\nfront door was found to be closed, and the light in the vestibule was\nextinguished. Marguerite was obliged to ring five or six times before\nthe concierge made his appearance.\n\n“I wish to see Monsieur Ferailleur,” she quietly said.\n\nThe man glanced at her scornfully, and then replied: “He no longer lives\nhere. The landlord doesn’t want any thieves in his house. He’s sold his\nrubbish and started for America, with his old witch of a mother.”\n\nSo saying he closed the door again, and Marguerite was so overwhelmed by\nthis last and unexpected misfortune, that she could hardly stagger back\nto the vehicle. “Gone!” she murmured; “gone! without a thought of me! Or\ndoes he believe me to be like all the rest? But I will find him again.\nThat man Fortunat, who ascertained addresses for M. de Chalusse, will\nfind Pascal for me.”\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\nFew people have any idea of the great number of estates which, in\ndefault of heirs to claim them, annually revert to the government. The\ntreasury derives large sums from this source every year. And this is\neasily explained, for nowadays family ties are becoming less and less\nbinding. Brothers cease to meet; their children no longer know each\nother; and the members of the second generation are as perfect strangers\nas though they were not united by a bond of consanguinity. The young man\nwhom love of adventure lures to a far-off country, and the young girl\nwho marries against her parents’ wishes, soon cease to exist for their\nrelatives. No one even inquires what has become of them. Those who\nremain at home are afraid to ask whether they are prosperous or\nunfortunate, lest they should be called upon to assist the wanderers.\nForgotten themselves, the adventurers in their turn soon forget.\nIf fortune smiles upon them, they are careful not to inform their\nrelatives. Poor--they have been cast off; wealthy--they themselves deny\ntheir kindred. Having become rich unaided, they find an egotistical\nsatisfaction in spending their money alone in accordance with their own\nfancies. Now when a man of this class dies what happens? The servants\nand people around him profit of his loneliness and isolation, and the\njustice of the peace is only summoned to affix the seals, after they\nhave removed all the portable property. An inventory is taken, and after\na few formalities, as no heirs present themselves, the court declares\nthe inheritance to be in abeyance, and appoints a trustee.\n\nThis trustee’s duties are very simple. He manages the property and\nremits the income to the Treasury until a legal judgment declares the\nestate the property of the country, regardless of any heirs who may\npresent themselves in future.\n\n“If I only had a twentieth part of the money that is lost in this way,\nmy fortune would be made,” exclaimed a shrewd man, some thirty years\nago.\n\nThe person who spoke was Antoine Vaudore. For six months he secretly\nnursed the idea, studying it, examining it in all respects, weighing its\nadvantages and disadvantages, and at last he decided that it was a good\none. That same year, indeed, assisted by a little capital which he\nhad obtained no one knew how, he created a new, strange, and untried\nprofession to supply a new demand.\n\nThus Vaudore was the first man who made heir-hunting a profession.\nAs will be generally admitted, it is not a profession that can be\nsuccessfully followed by a craven. It requires the exercise of unusual\nshrewdness, untiring activity, extraordinary energy and courage, as\nwell as great tact and varied knowledge. The man who would follow it\nsuccessfully must possess the boldness of a gambler, the sang-froid of a\nduelist, the keen perceptive powers and patience of a detective, and the\nresources and quick wit of the shrewdest attorney.\n\nIt is easier to decry the profession than to exercise it. To begin with,\nthe heir-hunter must be posted up with information respecting unclaimed\ninheritances, and he must have sufficient acquaintance with the legal\nworld to be able to obtain information from the clerks of the different\ncourts, notaries, and so on. When he learns that a man has died without\nany known heirs, his first care is to ascertain the amount of unclaimed\nproperty, to see if it will pay him to take up the case. If he finds\nthat the inheritance is a valuable one, he begins operations without\ndelay. He must first ascertain the deceased’s full name and age. It is\neasy to procure this information; but it is more difficult to discover\nthe name of the place where the deceased was born, his profession,\nwhat countries he lived in, his tastes and mode of life--in a word,\neverything that constitutes a complete biography.\n\nHowever, when he has armed himself with the more indispensable facts,\nour agent opens the campaign with extreme prudence, for it would be\nruinous to awake suspicion. It is curious to observe the incomparable\naddress which the agent displays in his efforts to learn the particulars\nof the deceased’s life, by consulting his friends, his enemies, his\ndebtors, and all who ever knew him, until at last some one is found who\nsays: “Such and such a man--why, he came from our part of the country.\nI never knew HIM, but I am acquainted with one of his brothers--with one\nof his uncles--or with one of his nephews.”\n\nVery often years of constant research, a large outlay of money, and\ncostly and skilful advertising in all the European journals, are\nnecessary before this result is reached. And it is only when it has been\nattained that the agent can take time to breathe. But now the chances\nare greatly in his favor. The worst is over. The portion of his task\nwhich depended on chance alone is concluded. The rest is a matter of\nskill, tact, and shrewdness. The detective must give place to the crafty\nlawyer. The agent must confer with this heir, who has been discovered at\nthe cost of so much time and trouble and induce him to bestow a portion\nof this prospective wealth on the person who is able to establish\nhis claim. There must be an agreement in writing clearly stating what\nproportion--a tenth, a third, or a half--the agent will be entitled\nto. The negotiation is a very delicate and difficult one, requiring\nprodigious presence of mind, and an amount of duplicity which would make\nthe most astute diplomatist turn pale with envy. Occasionally, the heir\nsuspects the truth, sneers at the proposition, and hurries off to claim\nthe whole of the inheritance that belongs to him. The agent may then bid\nhis hopes farewell. He has worked and spent money for nothing.\n\nHowever, such a misfortune is of rare occurrence. On hearing of the\nunexpected good fortune that has befallen him, the heir is generally\nunsuspicious, and willingly promises to pay the amount demanded of him.\nA contract is drawn up and signed; and then, but only then, does the\nagent take his client into his confidence. “You are the relative of such\na person, are you not?” “Yes.” “Very well. He is dead, and you are his\nheir. Thank Providence, and make haste to claim your money.”\n\nAs a rule, the heir loyally fulfils his obligation. But sometimes\nit happens that, when he has obtained undisputed possession of the\nproperty, he declares that he has been swindled, and refuses to fulfil\nhis part of the contract. Then the case must go to the courts. It is\ntrue, however, that the judgment of the tribunals generally recalls the\nrefractory client to a sense of gratitude and humility.\n\nNow our friend M. Isidore Fortunat was a hunter of missing heirs.\nUndoubtedly he often engaged in other business which was a trifle less\nrespectable; but heir-hunting was one of the best and most substantial\nsources of his income. So we can readily understand why he so quickly\nleft off lamenting that forty thousand francs lent to the Marquis de\nValorsay.\n\nChanging his tactics, he said to himself that, even if he had lost this\namount through M. de Chalusse’s sudden death, it was much less than he\nmight obtain if he succeeded in discovering the unknown heirs to so many\nmillions. And he had some reason to hope that he would be able to do\nso. Having been employed by M. de Chalusse when the latter was\nseeking Mademoiselle Marguerite, M. Fortunat had gained some valuable\ninformation respecting his client, and the additional particulars which\nhe had obtained from Madame Vantrasson elated him to such an extent that\nmore than once he exclaimed: “Ah, well! it is, perhaps, a blessing in\ndisguise, after all.”\n\nStill, M. Isidore Fortunat slept but little after his stormy interview\nwith the Marquis de Valorsay. A loss of forty thousand francs is not\nlikely to impart a roseate hue to one’s dreams--and M. Fortunat prized\nhis money as if it had been the very marrow of his bones. By way of\nconsolation, he assured himself that he would not merely regain the sum,\nbut triple it; and yet this encouragement did not entirely restore\nhis peace of mind. The gain was only a possibility, and the loss was a\ncertainty. So he twisted, and turned, and tossed on his bed as if it had\nbeen a hot gridiron, exhausting himself in surmises, and preparing his\nmind for the difficulties which he would be obliged to overcome.\n\nHis plan was a simple one, but its execution was fraught with\ndifficulties. “I must discover M. de Chalusse’s sister, if she is\nstill living--I must discover her children, if she is dead,” he said to\nhimself. It was easy to SAY this; but how was he to do it? How could he\nhope to find this unfortunate girl, who had abandoned her home thirty\nyears previously, to fly, no one knew where, or with whom? How was he to\ngain any idea of the life she had lived, or the fate that had befallen\nher? At what point on the social scale, and in what country, should he\nbegin his investigations? These daughters of noble houses, who desert\nthe paternal roof in a moment of madness, generally die most miserably\nafter a wretched life. The girl of the lower classes is armed against\nmisfortune, and has been trained for the conflict. She can measure\nand calculate the force of her fall, and regulate and control it to a\ncertain extent. But the others cannot. They have never known privation\nand hardship, and are, therefore, defenceless. And for the very reason\nthat they have been hurled from a great height, they often fall down\ninto the lowest depths of infamy.\n\n“If morning would only come,” sighed M. Isidore Fortunat, as he tossed\nrestlessly to and fro. “As soon as morning comes I will set to work!”\n\nBut just before daybreak he fell asleep; and at nine o’clock he was\nstill slumbering so soundly that Madame Dodelin, his housekeeper, had\nconsiderable difficulty in waking him. “Your clerks have come,” she\nexclaimed, shaking him vigorously; “and two clients are waiting for you\nin the reception-room.”\n\nHe sprang up, hastily dressed himself, and went into his office. It cost\nhim no little effort to receive his visitors that morning; but it would\nhave been folly to neglect all his other business for the uncertain\nChalusse affair. The first client who entered was a man still young, of\ncommon, even vulgar appearance. Not being acquainted with M. Fortunat,\nhe deemed it proper to introduce himself without delay. “My name is\nLeplaintre, and I am a coal merchant,” said he. “I was recommended to\ncall on you by my friend Bouscat, who was formerly in the wine trade.”\n\nM. Fortunat bowed. “Pray be seated,” was his reply. “I remember your\nfriend very well. If I am not mistaken I gave him some advice with\nreference to his third failure.”\n\n“Precisely; and it is because I find myself in the same fix as Bouscat\nthat I have called on you. Business is very bad, and I have notes to a\nlarge amount overdue, so that--”\n\n“You will be obliged to go into bankruptcy.”\n\n“Alas! I fear so.”\n\nM. Fortunat already knew what his client desired, but it was against\nhis principles to meet these propositions more than half way. “Will you\nstate your case?” said he.\n\nThe coal merchant blushed. It was hard to confess the truth; but the\neffort had to be made. “This is my case,” he replied, at last. “Among\nmy creditors I have several enemies, who will refuse me a release. They\nwould like to deprive me of everything I possess. And in that case, what\nwould become of me? Is it right that I should be compelled to starve?”\n\n“It is a bad outlook.”\n\n“It is, indeed, monsieur; and for this reason, I desire--if possible, if\nI can do so without danger--for I am an honest man, monsieur--I wish to\nretain a little property--secretly, of course, not for myself, by any\nmeans, but I have a young wife and----”\n\nM. Fortunat took compassion on the man’s embarrassment. “In short,”\n he interrupted, “you wish to conceal a part of your capital from your\ncreditors?”\n\nOn hearing this precise and formal statement of his honorable\nintentions, the coal-merchant trembled. His feelings of integrity would\nnot have been alarmed by a periphrasis, but this plain speaking shocked\nhim. “Oh, monsieur!” he protested, “I would rather blow my brains out\nthan defraud my creditors of a single penny that was rightfully theirs.\nWhat I am doing is for their interest, you understand. I shall begin\nbusiness again under my wife’s name; and if I succeed, they shall be\npaid--yes, monsieur, every sou, with interest. Ah! if I had only myself\nto think of, it would be quite different; but I have two children, two\nlittle girls, so that----”\n\n“Very well,” replied M. Fortunat. “I should suggest to you the same\nexpedient as I suggested to your friend Bouscat. But you must gather a\nlittle ready money together before going into bankruptcy.”\n\n“I can do that by secretly disposing of a part of my stock, so----”\n\n“In that case, you are saved. Sell it and put the money beyond your\ncreditors’ reach.”\n\nThe worthy merchant scratched his ear in evident perplexity.\n“Excuse me,” said he. “I had thought of this plan; but it seemed to\nme--dishonorable--and--also very dangerous. How could I explain this\ndecrease in my stock? My creditors hate me. If they suspected anything,\nthey would accuse me of fraud, and perhaps throw me into prison; and\nthen----”\n\nM. Fortunat shrugged his shoulders. “When I give advice,” he roughly\nreplied, “I furnish the means of following it without danger. Listen\nto me attentively. Let us suppose, for a moment, that some time ago you\npurchased, at a very high figure, a quantity of stocks and shares,\nwhich are to-day almost worthless, could not this unfortunate investment\naccount for the absence of the sum which you wish to set aside? Your\ncreditors would be obliged to value these securities, not at their\npresent, but at their former value.”\n\n“Evidently; but, unfortunately, I do not possess any such securities.”\n\n“You can purchase them.”\n\nThe coal-merchant opened his eyes in astonishment. “Excuse me,” he\nmuttered, “I don’t exactly understand you.”\n\nHe did not understand in the least; but M. Fortunat enlightened him by\nopening his safe, and displaying an enormous bundle of stocks and shares\nwhich had flooded the country a few years previously, and ruined a great\nmany poor, ignorant fools which were hungering for wealth; among them\nwere shares in the Tifila Mining Company, the Berchem Coal Mines, the\nGreenland Fisheries, the Mutual Trust and Loan Association, and so on.\nThere had been a time when each of these securities would have fetched\nfive hundred or a thousand francs at the Bourse, but now they were not\nworth the paper on which they were printed.\n\n“Let us suppose, my dear sir,” resumed M. Fortunat, “that you had a\ndrawer full of these securities----”\n\nBut the other did not allow him to finish. “I see,” he exclaimed; “I\nsee--I can sell my stock, and put the proceeds in my pocket with perfect\nsafety. There is enough to represent my capital a thousand times over.”\n\nAnd, in a paroxysm of delight, he added:\n\n“Give me enough of these shares to represent a capital of one hundred\nand twenty thousand francs; and give me some of each kind. I should like\nmy creditors to have a variety.”\n\nThereupon M. Fortunat counted out a pile of these worthless securities\nas carefully as if he had been handling bank-notes; and his client at\nthe same time drew out his pocketbook.\n\n“How much do I owe you?” he inquired.\n\n“Three thousand francs.”\n\nThe honest merchant bounded from his chair. “Three thousand francs!” he\nrepeated. “You must be jesting. That trash is not worth a louis.”\n\n“I would not even give five francs for it,” rejoined M. Fortunat,\ncoldly; “but it is true that I don’t desire to purchase these shares in\nmy creditors’ interest. With you it is quite a different matter--this\ntrash, as you very justly call it, will save you at least a hundred\nthousand francs. I ask only three per cent., which is certainly not\ndear. Still, you know, I don’t force any one to purchase them.” And, in\na terribly significant tone, he added: “You can undoubtedly buy\nsimilar securities on better terms; but take care you don’t arouse your\ncreditors’ suspicions by applying elsewhere.”\n\n“He would betray me, the scoundrel!” thought the merchant. And,\nrealizing that he had fallen into a trap, “Here are three thousand\nfrancs,” he sighed; “but at least, my dear sir, give me good measure,\nand throw in a few thousand francs more.”\n\nThe coal-merchant smiled the ghastly smile of a man who sees no way of\nescape from imposition, and has, therefore, resolved to submit with the\nbest grace possible. But M. Fortunat’s gravity did not relax. He\ngave what he had promised--neither more nor less--in exchange for the\nbank-notes, and even gravely exclaimed: “See if the amount is correct.”\n\nHis client pocketed the shares without counting them: but before leaving\nthe room he made his estimable adviser promise to assist him at the\ndecisive moment, and help him to prepare one of those clear financial\nstatements which make creditors say: “This is an honest man who has been\nextremely unfortunate.”\n\nM. Fortunat was admirably fitted to render this little service; for he\ndevoted such part of his time as was not spent in hunting for missing\nheirs to difficult liquidations, and he had indeed made bankruptcy\na specialty in which he was without a rival. The business was a\nremunerative one, thanks to the expedient he had revealed to the\ncoal-merchant--an expedient which is common enough nowadays, but of\nwhich he might almost be called the inventor. It consisted in compelling\nthe persons who asked for his advice to purchase worthless shares\nat whatever price he chose to set upon them, and they were forced to\nsubmit, under penalty of denunciation and exposure.\n\nThe client who followed the coal-merchant proved to be a simple\ncreature, who had called to ask for some advice respecting a slight\ndifficulty between himself and his landlord. M. Fortunat speedily\ndisposed of him, and then, opening the door leading into the outer\noffice, he called: “Cashier!”\n\nA shabbily-dressed man, some thirty-five years of age, at once entered\nthe private sanctum, carrying a money-bag in one hand and a ledger in\nthe other.\n\n“How many debtors were visited yesterday?” inquired M. Fortunat.\n\n“Two hundred and thirty-seven.”\n\n“What was the amount collected?”\n\n“Eighty-nine francs.”\n\nM. Isidore Fortunat’s grimace was expressive of satisfaction. “Not bad,”\n said he, “not at all bad.”\n\nThen a singular performance began. M. Fortunat called over the names of\nhis debtors, one by one, and the cashier answered each name by reading\na memorandum written against it on the margin of a list he held. “Such\na one,” said the agent, “and such a one--and such----” Whereupon the\ncashier replied: “Has paid two francs--was not at home--paid twenty\nsous--would not pay anything.”\n\nHow did it happen that M. Fortunat had so many debtors? This question\ncan be easily answered. In settling bankrupts’ estates it was easy for\nhim to purchase a large number of debts which were considered worthless,\nat a trifling cost, and he reaped a bountiful harvest on a field which\nwould have yielded nothing to another person. It was not because he\nwas rigorous in his demands; he conquered by patience, gentleness, and\npoliteness, but also by unwearying perseverance and tenacity. When he\ndecided that a debtor was to pay him a certain sum, it was paid. He\nnever relaxed in his efforts. Every other day some one was sent to\nvisit the debtor, to follow him, and harass him; he was surrounded by\nM. Fortunat’s agents; they pursued him to his office, shop, or\ncafe--everywhere, continually, incessantly--and always with the most\nperfect urbanity. At last even the most determined succumbed; to escape\nthis frightful persecution, they, somehow or other, found the money to\nsatisfy M. Fortunat’s claim. Besides Victor Chupin, he had five other\nagents whose business it was to visit these poor wretches. A list was\nassigned to each man every morning; and when evening came, he made his\nreport to the cashier, who in turn reported to his employer. This branch\nof industry added considerably to the profits of M. Fortunat’s other\nbusiness, and was the third and last string to his bow.\n\nThe report proceeded as usual, but it was quite evident that M.\nFortunat’s thoughts were elsewhere. He paused each moment to listen\neagerly for the slightest sound outside, for before receiving the\ncoal-merchant he had told Victor Chupin to run to the Rue de Courcelles\nand ask M. Casimir for news of the Count de Chalusse. He had done this\nmore than an hour before; and Victor Chupin, who was usually so prompt,\nhad not yet made his appearance.\n\nAt last, however, he returned, whereupon M. Fortunat dismissed the\ncashier, and addressed his messenger: “Well?” he asked.\n\n“He is no longer living. They think he died without a will, and that the\npretty young lady will be turned out of the house.”\n\nThis information agreed so perfectly with M. Fortunat’s presentiments\nthat he did not even wince, but calmly asked: “Will Casimir keep his\nappointment?”\n\n“He told me that he would endeavor to come, and I’d wager a hundred to\none that he will be there; he would travel ten leagues to put something\ngood into his stomach.”\n\nM. Fortunat’s opinion coincided with Chupin’s. “Very well,” said he.\n“Only you were a long time on the road, Victor.”\n\n“That’s true, m’sieur; but I had a little matter of my own to attend\nto--a matter of a hundred francs, if you please.”\n\nM. Fortunat knit his brows angrily. “It’s only right to attend to\nbusiness,” said he; “but you think too much of money, Victor--altogether\ntoo much. You are insatiable.”\n\nThe young man proudly lifted his head, and with an air of importance,\nreplied: “I have so many responsibilities----”\n\n“Responsibilities!--you?”\n\n“Yes, indeed, m’sieur. And why not? My poor, good mother hasn’t been\nable to work for a year, and who would care for her if I didn’t?\nCertainly not my father, the good-for-nothing scamp, who squandered all\nthe Duke de Sairmeuse’s money without giving us a sou of it. Besides,\nI’m like other men, I’m anxious to be rich, and enjoy myself. I should\nlike to ride in my carriage like other people do. And whenever a gamin,\nsuch as I was once, opened the door for ME, I should put a five-franc\npiece in his hand----”\n\nHe was interrupted by Madame Dodelin, the worthy housekeeper, who rushed\ninto the room without knocking, in a terrible state of excitement.\n“Monsieur!” she exclaimed, in the same tone as if she would have called\n“Fire!” “here is Monsieur de Valorsay.”\n\nM. Fortunat sprang up and turned extremely pale. “What to the devil\nbrings him here?” he anxiously stammered. “Tell him that I’ve gone\nout--tell him--”\n\nBut it was useless, for the marquis at that very moment entered the\nroom, and the agent could only dismiss his housekeeper and Chupin.\n\nM. de Valorsay seemed to be very angry, and it looked as if he meant\nto give vent to his passion. Indeed, as soon as he was alone with M.\nFortunat, he began: “So this is the way you betray your friends,\nMaster Twenty-per-Cent! Why did you deceive me last night about the ten\nthousand francs you had promised me? Why didn’t you tell me the truth?\nYou knew of the misfortune that had befallen M. de Chalusse. I heard of\nit first scarcely an hour ago through a letter from Madame Leon.”\n\nM. Fortunat hesitated somewhat. He was a quiet man, opposed to violence\nof any kind; and it seemed to him that M. de Valorsay was twisting and\nturning his cane in a most ominous manner. “I must confess, Monsieur le\nMarquis,” he at last replied, “that I had not the courage to tell you of\nthe dreadful misfortune which had befallen us.”\n\n“How--US?”\n\n“Certainly. If you lose the hope of several millions, I also lose the\namount I advanced to you, forty thousand francs--my entire fortune. And\nyet, you see that I don’t complain. Do as I do--confess that the game is\nlost.”\n\nThe marquis was listening with an air of suppressed wrath; his face\nwas crimson, there was a dark frown on his brow, and his hands were\nclinched. He was apparently furious with passion, but in reality he\nwas perfectly self-possessed. The best proof that can be given of his\ncoolness is that he was carefully studying M. Fortunat’s face, and\ntrying to discover the agent’s real intentions under his meaningless\nwords. He had expected to find “his dear extortioner” exasperated by his\nloss, cursing and swearing, and demanding his money--but not at all.\nHe found him more gentle and calm, colder and more reserved than\never; brimful of resignation indeed, and preaching submission to the\ninevitable. “What can this mean?” he thought, with an anxious heart.\n“What mischief is the scoundrel plotting now? I’d wager a thousand to\none that he’s forging some thunderbolt to crush me.” And, in a haughty\ntone, he said aloud:\n\n“In a word, you desert me.”\n\nWith a deprecatory gesture, M. Fortunat exclaimed: “I desert you,\nMonsieur le Marquis! What have I done that you should think so ill\nof me? Alas! circumstances are the only traitors. I shouldn’t like to\ndeprive you of the courage you so much need, but, honestly, it would be\nfolly to struggle against destiny. How can you hope to succeed in your\nplans? Have you not resorted to every possible expedient to prolong your\napparently brilliant existence until the present time? Are you not at\nsuch a point that you must marry Mademoiselle Marguerite in a month’s\ntime, or perish? And now the count’s millions are lost! If I might\nbe allowed to give you some advice, I should say, ‘The shipwreck is\ninevitable; think only of saving yourself.’ By tact and shrewdness, you\nmight yet save something from your creditors. Compromise with them. And\nif you need my services, here I am. Go to Nice, and give me a power\nof attorney to act for you. From the debris of your fortune, I will\nundertake to guarantee you a competence which would satisfy many an\nambitious man.”\n\nThe marquis laughed sneeringly. “Excellent!” he exclaimed. “You would\nrid yourself of me and recover your forty thousand francs at the same\ntime. A very clever arrangement.”\n\nM. Fortunat realized that his client understood him; but what did it\nmatter? “I assure you----” he began.\n\nBut the marquis silenced him with a contemptuous gesture. “Let us stop\nthis nonsense,” said he. “We understand each other better than that.\nI have never made any attempt to deceive you, nor have I ever supposed\nthat I had succeeded in doing so, and pray do me the honor to consider\nme as shrewd as yourself.” And still refusing to listen to the agent, he\ncontinued: “If I have come to you, it is only because the case is not so\ndesperate as you suppose. I still hold some valuable cards which you\nare ignorant of. In your opinion, and every one else’s, Mademoiselle\nMarguerite is ruined. But I know that she is still worth three millions,\nat the very least.”\n\n“Mademoiselle Marguerite?”\n\n“Yes, Monsieur Twenty-per-Cent. Let her become my wife, and the very\nnext day I will place her in possession of an income of a hundred and\nfifty thousand francs. But she must marry me first; and this scornful\nmaiden will not grant me her hand unless I can convince her of my love\nand disinterestedness.”\n\n“But your rival?”\n\nM. de Valorsay gave a nervous start, but quickly controlled himself.\n“He no longer exists. Read this day’s Figaro, and you will be edified.\nI have no rival now. If I can only conceal my financial embarrassment a\nlittle longer, she is mine. A friendless and homeless girl cannot defend\nherself long in Paris--especially when she has an adviser like Madame\nLeon. Oh! I shall win her! I shall have her!--she is a necessity to me.\nNow you can judge if it would be wise on your part to deprive me of your\nassistance. Would you like to know what I want? Simply this--the means\nto sustain me two or three months longer--some thirty thousand francs.\nYou can procure the money--will you? It would make, in all, seventy\nthousand francs that I should owe you, and I will promise to pay you\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand if I succeed--and I shall succeed! Such\nprofit is worth some risk. Reflect, and decide. But no more subterfuges,\nif you please. Let your answer be plain yes or no.”\n\nWithout a second’s hesitation, M. Fortunat replied, “No.”\n\nThe flush on the marquis’s face deepened, and his voice became a trifle\nharsher; but that was all. “Confess, then, that you have resolved to\nruin me,” he said. “You refuse before you have heard me to the end.\nWait, at least, until I have told you my plans, and shown you the solid\nfoundation which my hopes rest upon.”\n\nBut M. Fortunat had resolved to listen to nothing. He wished for no\nexplanations, so distrustful was he of himself--so much did he fear\nthat his adventurous nature would urge him to incur further risk. He was\npositively afraid of the Marquis de Valorsay’s eloquence; besides, he\nknew well enough that the person who consents to listen is at least half\nconvinced. “Tell me nothing, monsieur,” he hastily answered; “it would\nbe useless. I haven’t the money. If I had given you ten thousand francs\nlast night, I should have been compelled to borrow them of M. Prosper\nBertomy. And even if I had the money, I should still say ‘Impossible.’\nEvery man has his system--his theory, you know. Mine is, never to run\nafter my money. With me, whatever I may lose, I regard it as finally\nlost; I think no more about it, and turn to something else. So your\nforty thousand francs have already been entered on my profit and loss\naccount. And yet it would be easy enough for you to repay me, if you\nwould follow my advice and go quietly into bankruptcy.”\n\n“Never!” interrupted M. de Valorsay; “never! I do not wish to\ntemporize,” he continued. “I will save all, or save nothing. If you\nrefuse me your help, I shall apply elsewhere. I will never give my\ngood friends, who detest me, and whom I cordially hate in return, the\ndelicious joy of seeing the Marquis de Valorsay fall step by step from\nthe high position he has occupied. I will never truckle to the men whom\nI have eclipsed for fifteen years. No, never! I would rather die, or\neven commit the greatest crime!”\n\nHe suddenly checked himself, a trifle astonished, perhaps, by his own\nplain-speaking; and, for a moment, he and M. Fortunat looked into each\nother’s eyes, striving to divine their respective secret thoughts.\n\nThe marquis was the first to speak. “And so,” said he, in a tone which\nhe strove to make persuasive, but which was threatening instead, “it is\nsettled--your decision is final?”\n\n“Final.”\n\n“You will not even condescend to listen to my explanation?”\n\n“It would be a loss of time.”\n\nOn receiving this cruel reply, M. de Valorsay struck the desk such a\nformidable blow with his clenched fist that several bundles of papers\nfell to the floor. His anger was not feigned now. “What are you\nplotting, then?” he exclaimed; “and what do you intend to do? What is\nyour object in betraying me? Take care! It is my life that I am going\nto defend, and as truly as there is a God in heaven, I shall defend it\nwell. A man who is determined to blow his brains out if he is defeated,\nis a terribly dangerous adversary. Woe to you, if I ever find you\nstanding between me and the Count de Chalusse’s millions!”\n\nEvery drop of blood had fled from M. Fortunat’s face, still his mien was\ncomposed and dignified. “You do wrong to threaten me,” said he. “I don’t\nfear you in the least. If I were your enemy, I should bring suit against\nyou for the forty thousand francs you owe me. I should not obtain my\nmoney, of course, but I could shatter the tottering edifice of your\nfortune by a single blow. Besides, you forget that I possess a copy of\nour agreement, signed by your own hand, and that I have only to show\nit to Mademoiselle Marguerite to give her a just opinion of your\ndisinterestedness. Let us sever our connection now, monsieur, and each\ngo his own way without reference to the other. If you should succeed you\nwill repay me.”\n\nVictory perched upon the agent’s banner, and it was with a feeling of\npride that he saw his noble client depart, white and speechless with\nrage. “What a rascal that marquis is,” he muttered. “I would certainly\nwarn Mademoiselle Marguerite, poor girl, if I were not so much afraid of\nhim.”\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\nM. Casimir, the deceased Count de Chalusse’s valet, was neither better\nnor worse than most of his fellows. Old men tell us that there formerly\nexisted a race of faithful servants, who considered themselves a part\nof the family that employed them, and who unhesitatingly embraced its\ninterests and its ideas. At the same time their masters requited their\ndevotion by efficacious protection and provision for the future. But\nsuch masters and such servants are nowadays only found in the old\nmelodramas performed at the Ambigu, in “The Emigre,” for instance, or\nin “The Last of the Chateauvieux.” At present servants wander from one\nhouse to another, looking on their abode as a mere inn where they may\nfind shelter till they are disposed for another journey. And families\nreceive them as transient, and not unfrequently as dangerous,\nguests, whom it is always wise to treat with distrust. The key of\nthe wine-cellar is not confided to these unreliable inmates; they are\nintrusted with the charge of little else than the children--a practice\nwhich is often productive of terrible results.\n\nM. Casimir was no doubt honest, in the strict sense of the word. He\nwould have scorned to rob his master of a ten-sous piece; and yet\nhe would not have hesitated in the least to defraud him of a hundred\nfrancs, if an opportunity had presented itself. Vain and rapacious in\ndisposition, he consoled himself by refusing to obey any one save his\nemployer, by envying him with his whole heart, and by cursing fate\nfor not having made him the Count de Chalusse instead of the Count de\nChalusse’s servant. As he received high wages, he served passably well;\nbut he employed the best part of his energy in watching the count. He\nscented some great family secret in the household, and he felt angry and\nhumiliated that this secret had not been intrusted to his discretion.\nAnd if he had discovered nothing, it was because M. de Chalusse had been\ncaution personified, as Madame Leon had declared.\n\nThus it happened that when M. Casimir saw Mademoiselle Marguerite\nand the count searching in the garden for the fragments of a letter\ndestroyed in a paroxysm of rage which he had personally witnessed,\nhis natural curiosity was heightened to such a degree as to become\nunendurable. He would have given a month’s wages, and something over,\nto have known the contents of that letter, the fragments of which were\nbeing so carefully collected by the count. And when he heard M. de\nChalusse tell Mademoiselle Marguerite that the most important part\nof the letter was still lacking, and saw his master relinquish his\nfruitless search, the worthy valet vowed that he would be more skilful\nor more fortunate than his master; and after diligent effort, he\nactually succeeded in recovering five tiny scraps of paper, which had\nbeen blown into the shrubbery.\n\nThey were covered with delicate handwriting, a lady’s unquestionably;\nbut he was utterly unable to extract the slightest meaning from them.\nNevertheless, he preserved them with jealous care, and was careful\nnot to say that he had found them. The incoherent words which he had\ndeciphered on these scraps of paper mixed strangely in his brain, and\nhe grew more and more anxious to learn what connection there was between\nthis letter and the count’s attack. This explains his extreme readiness\nto search the count’s clothes when Mademoiselle Marguerite told him to\nlook for the key of the escritoire. And fortune favored him, for he not\nonly found the key, but he also discovered the torn fragments of\nthe letter, and having crumpled them up in the palm of his hand, he\ncontrived to slip them into his pocket. Fruitless dexterity! M. Casimir\nhad joined these scraps to the fragments he had found himself, he had\nread and re-read the epistle, but it told him nothing; or, at least, the\ninformation it conveyed was so vague and incomplete that it heightened\nhis curiosity all the more. Once he almost decided to give the letter\nto Mademoiselle Marguerite, but he resisted this impulse, saying to\nhimself: “Ah, no; I’m not such a fool! It might be of use to her.”\n\nAnd M. Casimir had no desire to be of service to this unhappy girl, who\nhad always treated him with kindness. He hated her, under the pretence\nthat she was not in her proper place, that no one knew who or what she\nwas, and that it was absurd that he--he, Casimir--should be compelled\nto receive orders from her. The infamous slander which Mademoiselle\nMarguerite had overheard on her way home from church, “There goes the\nrich Count de Chalusse’s mistress,” was M. Casimir’s work. He had sworn\nto be avenged on this haughty creature; and no one can say what he\nmight have attempted, if it had not been for the intervention of the\nmagistrate. Imperatively called to order, M. Casimir consoled himself\nby the thought that the magistrate had intrusted him with eight thousand\nfrancs and the charge of the establishment. Nothing could have\npleased him better. First and foremost, it afforded him a magnificent\nopportunity to display his authority and act the master, and it also\nenabled him to carry out his compact with Victor Chupin, and repair to\nthe rendezvous which M. Isidore Fortunat had appointed.\n\nLeaving his comrades to watch the magistrate’s operations, he sent M.\nBourigeau to report the count’s death at the district mayor’s office,\nand then lighting a cigar he walked out of the house, and strolled\nleisurely up the Rue de Courcelles. The place appointed for his meeting\nwith M. Fortunat was on the Boulevard Haussmann, almost opposite\nBinder’s, the famous carriage builder. Although it was rather a\nwine-shop than a restaurant, a capital breakfast could be obtained there\nas M. Casimir had ascertained to his satisfaction several times before.\n“Has no one called for me?” he asked, as he went in.\n\n“No one.”\n\nHe consulted his watch, and evinced considerable surprise. “Not yet\nnoon!” he exclaimed. “I’m in advance; and as that is the case, give me a\nglass of absinthe and a newspaper.”\n\nHe was obeyed with far more alacrity than his deceased master had ever\nrequired him to show, and he forthwith plunged into the report of\nthe doings at the Bourse, with the eagerness of a man who has an\nall-sufficient reason for his anxiety in a drawer at home. Having\nemptied one glass of absinthe, he was about to order a second, when he\nfelt a tap on the shoulder, and on turning round he beheld M. Isidore\nFortunat.\n\nIn accordance with his wont, the agent was attired in a style of severe\nelegance--with gloves and boots fitting him to perfection--but an\nunusually winning smile played upon his lips. “You see I have been\nwaiting for you,” exclaimed M. Casimir.\n\n“I am late, it’s true,” replied M. Fortunat, “but we will do our best\nto make up for lost time; for, I trust, you will do me the honor of\nbreakfasting with me?”\n\n“Really, I don’t know that I ought.”\n\n“Yes, yes, you must. They will give us a private room; we must have a\ntalk.”\n\nIt was certainly not for the pleasure of the thing that M. Fortunat\ncultivated M. Casimir’s acquaintance, and entertained him at breakfast.\nM. Fortunat, who was a very proud man, considered this connection\nsomewhat beneath his dignity; but at first, circumstances, and afterward\ninterest, had required him to overcome his repugnance. It was through\nthe Count de Chalusse that he had made M. Casimir’s acquaintance. While\nthe count was employing the agent he had frequently sent his valet to\nhim with messages and letters. Naturally, M. Casimir had talked on these\noccasions, and the agent had listened to him; hence this superficial\nfriendship. Subsequently when the marriage contemplated by the Marquis\nde Valorsay was in course of preparation, M. Fortunat had profited of\nthe opportunity to make the count’s servant his spy; and it had been\neasy to find a pretext for continuing the acquaintance, as M. Casimir\nwas a speculator, or rather a dabbler in stocks and shares. So, whenever\nhe needed information, M. Fortunat invited M. Casimir to breakfast,\nknowing the potent influence of a good bottle of wine offered at the\nright moment. It is needless to say that he exercised uncommon care in\nthe composition of the menu on a day like this when his future course\ndepended, perhaps, on a word more or less.\n\nM. Casimir’s eye sparkled as he took his seat at the table opposite his\nentertainer. The crafty agent had chosen a little room looking out on to\nthe boulevard. Not that it was more spacious or elegant than the others,\nbut it was isolated, and this was a very great advantage; for every one\nknows how unsafe and perfidious are those so-called private rooms which\nare merely separated from each other by a thin partition, scarcely\nthicker than a sheet of paper. It was not long before M. Fortunat had\nreason to congratulate himself on his foresight, for the breakfast began\nwith a dish of shrimps, and M. Casimir had not finished his twelfth,\nwashed down by a glass of chablis, before he declared that he could see\nno impropriety in confiding certain things to a friend.\n\nThe events of the morning had completely turned his head; and gratified\nvanity and good cheer excited him to such a degree that he discoursed\nwith unwonted volubility. With total disregard of prudence, he talked\nwith inexcusable freedom of the Count de Chalusse, and M. de Valorsay,\nand especially of his enemy, Mademoiselle Marguerite. “For it is she,”\n he exclaimed, rapping on the table with his knife--“it is she who has\ntaken the missing millions! How she did it, no one will ever know, for\nshe has not an equal in craftiness; but it’s she who has stolen them,\nI’m sure of it! I would have taken my oath to that effect before the\nmagistrate, and I would have proved it, too, if he hadn’t taken her part\nbecause she’s pretty--for she is devilishly pretty.”\n\nEven if M. Fortunat had wished to put in a word or two, he could have\nfound no opportunity. But his guest’s loquacity did not displease him;\nit gave him an opportunity for reflection. Strange thoughts arose in his\nmind, and connecting M. Casimir’s affirmations with the assurances of\nthe Marquis de Valorsay, he was amazed at the coincidence. “It’s very\nsingular!” he thought. “Has this girl really stolen the money? and has\nthe marquis discovered the fact through Madame Leon, and determined to\nprofit by the theft? In that case, I may get my money back, after all! I\nmust look into the matter.”\n\nA partridge and a bottle of Pomard followed the shrimps and chablis; and\nM. Casimir’s loquacity increased, and his voice rose higher and higher.\nHe wandered from one absurd story to another, and from slander to\nslander, until suddenly, and without the slightest warning, he began to\nspeak of the mysterious letter which he considered the undoubted cause\nof the count’s illness.\n\nAt the first word respecting this missive, M. Fortunat started\nviolently. “Nonsense!” said he, with an incredulous air. “Why the devil\nshould this letter have had such an influence?”\n\n“I don’t know. But it is certain--it had.” And, in support of his\nassertion, he told M. Fortunat how the count had destroyed the letter\nalmost without reading it, and how he had afterward searched for the\nfragments, in order to find an address it had contained. “And I’m quite\nsure,” said the valet, “that the count intended to apply to you for the\naddress of the person who wrote the letter.”\n\n“Are you sure of that?”\n\n“As sure as I am of drinking Pomard!” exclaimed M. Casimir, draining his\nglass.\n\nRarely had the agent experienced such emotion. He did not doubt but what\nthis missive contained the solution of the mystery. “Were the scraps of\nthis letter found?” he asked.\n\n“I have them,” cried the valet, triumphantly. “I have them in my pocket,\nand, what’s more, I have the whole of them!”\n\nThis declaration made M. Fortunat turn pale with delight.\n“Indeed--indeed!” said he; “it must be a strange production.”\n\nHis companion pursed up his lips disdainfully. “May be so, may be not,”\n he retorted. “It’s impossible to understand a word of it. The only thing\ncertain about it is that it was written by a woman.”\n\n“Ah!”\n\n“Yes, by a former mistress, undoubtedly. And, naturally, she asks for\nmoney for a child. Women of that class always do so. They’ve tried the\ngame with me more than a dozen times, but I’m not so easily caught.” And\nbursting with vanity, he related three or four love affairs in which,\naccording to his own account, he must have played a most ignoble part.\n\nIf M. Fortunat’s chair had been a gridiron, heated by an excellent fire,\nhe could not have felt more uncomfortable. After pouring out bumper\nafter bumper for his guest, he perceived that he had gone too far,\nand that it would not be easy to check him. “And this letter?” he\ninterrupted, at last.\n\n“Well?”\n\n“You promised to let me read it.”\n\n“That’s true--that’s quite true; but it would be as well to have some\nmocha first, would it not? What if we ordered some mocha, eh?”\n\nCoffee was served, and when the waiter had closed the door, M. Casimir\ndrew the letter, the scraps of which were fixed together, from his\npocket, and unfolded it, saying: “Attention; I’m going to read.”\n\nThis did not suit M. Fortunat’s fancy. He would infinitely have\npreferred perusing it himself; but it is impossible to argue with an\nintoxicated man, and so M. Casimir with a more and more indistinct\nenunciation read as follows: “‘Paris, October 14, 186--.’ So the lady\nlives in Paris, as usual. After this she puts neither ‘monsieur,’ nor\n‘my friend,’ nor ‘dear count,’ nothing at all. She begins abruptly:\n‘Once before, many years ago, I came to you as a suppliant. You were\npitiless, and did not even deign to answer me. And yet, as I told you, I\nwas on the verge of a terrible precipice; my brain was reeling, vertigo\nhad seized hold of me. Deserted, I was wandering about Paris, homeless\nand penniless, and my child was starving!’”\n\nM. Casimir paused to laugh. “That’s like all the rest of them,” he\nexclaimed; “that is exactly like all the rest! I’ve ten such letters in\nmy drawer, even more imperative in their demands. If you’ll come home\nwith me after breakfast, I’ll show them to you. We’ll have a hearty\nlaugh over them!”\n\n“Let us finish this first.”\n\n“Of course.” And he resumed: “‘If I had been alone. I should not have\nhesitated. I was so wretched that death seemed a refuge to me. But\nwhat was to become of my child? Should I kill him, and destroy myself\nafterward? I thought of doing so, but I lacked the courage. And what\nI implored you in pity to give me, was rightfully mine. I had only to\npresent myself at your house and demand it. Alas! I did not know that\nthen. I believed myself bound by a solemn oath, and you inspired me\nwith inexpressible terror. And still I could not see my child die of\nstarvation before my very eyes. So I abandoned myself to my fate, and\nI have sunk so low that I have been obliged to separate from my son.\nHe must not know the shame to which he owes his livelihood. And he is\nignorant even of my existence.’”\n\nM. Fortunat was as motionless as if he had been turned to stone. After\nthe information he had obtained respecting the count’s past, and after\nthe story told him by Madame Vantrasson, he could scarcely doubt.\n“This letter,” he thought, “can only be from Mademoiselle Hermine de\nChalusse.”\n\nHowever, M. Casimir resumed his reading: “‘If I apply to you again, if\nfrom the depth of infamy into which I have fallen, I again call upon you\nfor help, it is because I am at the end of my resources--because, before\nI die, I must see my son’s future assured. It is not a fortune that I\nask for him, but sufficient to live upon, and I expect to receive it\nfrom you.’”\n\nOnce more the valet paused in his perusal of the letter to remark:\n“There it is again sufficient to live upon, and I expect to receive it\nfrom you!--Excellent! Women are remarkable creatures, upon my word! But\nlisten to the rest! ‘It is absolutely necessary that I should see you\nas soon as possible. Oblige me, therefore, by calling to-morrow, October\n15th, at the Hotel de Homburg, in the Rue du Helder. You will ask for\nMadame Lucy Huntley, and they will conduct you to me. I shall expect you\nfrom three o’clock to six. Come. I implore you, come. It is painful to\nme to add that if I do not hear from you, I am resolved to demand and\nOBTAIN--no matter what may be the consequences--the means which I have,\nso far, asked of you on my bended knees and with clasped hands.’”\n\nHaving finished the letter, M. Casimir laid it on the table, and poured\nout a glassful of brandy, which he drained at a single draught. “And\nthat’s all,” he remarked. “No signature--not even an initial. It was a\nso-called respectable woman who wrote that. They never sign their notes,\nthe hussies! for fear of compromising themselves, as I’ve reason to\nknow.” And so saying, he laughed the idiotic laugh of a man who has been\ndrinking immoderately. “If I had time,” he resumed, “I should make some\ninquiries about this Madame Lucy Huntley--a feigned name, evidently.\nI should like to know---- But what’s the matter with you, Monsieur\nFortunat? You are as pale as death. Are you ill?”\n\nTo tell the truth, the agent did look as if he were indisposed.\n“Thanks,” he stammered. “I’m very well, only I just remembered that some\none is waiting for me.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“A client.”\n\n“Nonsense!” rejoined the valet; “make some excuse; let him go about his\nbusiness. Aren’t you rich enough? Pour us out another glass of wine; it\nwill make you all right again.”\n\nM. Fortunat complied, but he performed the task so awkwardly, or,\nrather, so skilfully, that he drew toward him, with his sleeve, the\nletter which was lying beside M. Casimir’s plate. “To your health,” said\nthe valet. “To yours,” replied M. Fortunat. And in drawing back the arm\nhe had extended to chink glasses with his guest, he caused the letter to\nfall on his knees.\n\nM. Casimir, who had not observed this successful manoeuvre, was trying\nto light his cigar; and while vainly consuming a large quantity of\nmatches in the attempt, he exclaimed: “What you just said, my friend,\nmeans that you would like to desert me. That won’t do, my dear fellow!\nYou are going home with me; and I will read you some love-letters from\na woman of the world. Then we will go to Mourloup’s, and play a game of\nbilliards. That’s the place to enjoy one’s self. You’ll see Joseph, of\nthe Commarin household, a splendid comedian.”\n\n“Very well; but first I must settle the score here.”\n\n“Yes, pay.”\n\nM. Fortunat rang for his bill. He had obtained more information than\nhe expected; he had the letter in his pocket, and he had now only one\ndesire, to rid himself of M. Casimir. But this was no easy task. Drunken\nmen cling tenaciously to their friends; and M. Fortunat was asking\nhimself what strategy he could employ, when the waiter entered, and\nsaid: “There’s a very light-complexioned man here, who looks as if he\nwere a huissier’s clerk. He wishes to speak with you, gentlemen.”\n\n“Ah! it’s Chupin!” exclaimed the valet. “He is a friend. Let him come\nin, and bring us another glass. ‘The more the merrier,’ as the saying\ngoes.”\n\nWhat could Chupin want? M. Fortunat had no idea, but he was none the\nless grateful for his coming, being determined to hand this troublesome\nCasimir over to his keeping. On entering the room Chupin realized the\nvalet’s condition at the first glance, and his face clouded. He\nbowed politely to M. Fortunat, but addressed Casimir in an extremely\ndiscontented tone. “It’s three o’clock,” said he, “and I’ve come, as we\nagreed, to arrange with you about the count’s funeral.”\n\nThese words had the effect of a cold shower-bath on M. Casimir. “Upon\nmy word, I had forgotten--forgotten entirely, upon my word!” And the\nthought of his condition, and the responsibility he had accepted, coming\nupon him at the same time, he continued: “Good Heavens! I’m in a nice\nstate! It is all I can do to stand. What will they think at the house?\nWhat will they say?”\n\nM. Fortunat had drawn his clerk a little on one side. “Victor,” said he,\nquickly and earnestly, “I must go at once. Everything has been paid for;\nbut in case you need some money for a cab or anything of the sort, here\nare ten francs. If there’s any you don’t use, keep it for yourself. I\nleave this fool in your charge, take care of him.”\n\nThe sight of the ten-franc piece made Chupin’s face brighten a little.\n“Very well,” he replied. “I understand the business. I served my\napprenticeship as a ‘guardian angel’ when my grandmother kept the\nPoivriere.” [2]\n\n“Above all, don’t let him return home in his present state.”\n\n“Have no fears, monsieur, I must talk business with him, and so I shall\nhave him all right in a jiffy.” And as M. Fortunat made his escape,\nChupin beckoned to the waiter, and said:\n\n“Fetch me some very strong coffee, a handful of salt, and a lemon.\nThere’s nothing better for bringing a drunken man to his senses.”\n\n\n\n\nXV.\n\n\nM. Fortunat left the restaurant, almost on the run, for he feared that\nhe might be pursued and overtaken by M. Casimir. But after he had gone\na couple of hundred paces, he paused, not so much to take breath, as to\ncollect his scattered wits; and though the weather was cold, he seated\nhimself on a bench to reflect.\n\nNever in all his changeful life had he known such intense anxiety and\ntorturing suspense as he had just experienced in that little room in the\nrestaurant. He had longed for positive information and he had obtained\nit; but it had upset all his plans and annihilated all his hopes.\nImagining that the count’s heirs had been lost sight of, he had\ndetermined to find them and make a bargain with them, before they\nlearned that they were worth their millions. But on the contrary, these\nheirs were close at hand, watching M. de Chalusse, and knowing their\nrights so well that they were ready to fight for them. “For it was\ncertainly the count’s sister who wrote the letter which I have in my\npocket,” he murmured. “Not wishing to receive him at her own home, she\nprudently appointed a meeting at a hotel. But what about this name of\nHuntley? Is it really hers, or is it only assumed for the occasion?\nIs it the name of the man who enticed her from home, or is it the name\ngiven to the son from whom she has separated herself?”\n\nBut after all what was the use of all these conjectures? There was\nbut one certain and positive thing, and this was that the money he had\ncounted upon had escaped him; and he experienced as acute a pang as\nif he had lost forty thousand francs a second time. Perhaps, at that\nmoment, he was sorry that he had severed his connection with the\nmarquis. Still, he was not the man to despond, however desperate his\nplight might appear, without an attempt to better his situation. He\nknew how many surprising and sudden changes in fortune have been brought\nabout by some apparently trivial action. “I must discover this sister,”\n he said to himself--“I must ascertain her position and her plans.\nIf she has no one to advise her, I will offer my services; and who\nknows----”\n\nA cab was passing; M. Fortunat hailed it, and ordered the Jehu to drive\nhim to the Rue du Helder, No. 43, Hotel de Homburg.\n\nWas it by chance or premeditation that this establishment had received\nthe name of one of the gambling dens of Europe? Perhaps the following\ninformation may serve to answer the question. The Hotel de Homburg was\none of those flash hostelries frequented by adventurers of distinction,\nwho are attracted to Paris by the millions that are annually squandered\nthere. Spurious counts and questionable Russian princesses were sure\nto find a cordial welcome there with princely luxury, moderate prices,\nand--but very little confidence. Each person was called by the title\nwhich it pleased him to give on his arrival--Excellency or Prince,\naccording to his fancy. He could also find numerous servants carefully\ndrilled to play the part of old family retainers, and carriages upon\nwhich the most elaborate coat-of-arms could be painted at an hour’s\nnotice. Nor was there any difficulty whatever in immediately procuring\nall the accessories of a life of grandeur--all that is needful to dazzle\nthe unsuspecting, to throw dust in people’s eyes, and to dupe one’s\nchance acquaintances. All these things were provided without delay, by\nthe month, by the day or by the hour, just as the applicant pleased.\nBut there was no such thing as credit there. Bills were presented every\nevening, to those lodgers who did not pay in advance: and he who could\nnot, or would not, settle the score, even if he were Excellency or\nPrince, was requested to depart at once, and his trunks were held as\nsecurity.\n\nWhen M. Fortunat entered the office of the hotel, a woman, with a crafty\nlooking face, was holding a conference with an elderly gentleman, who\nhad a black velvet skullcap on his head, and a magnifying glass in his\nhand. They applied their eyes to the glass in turn, and were engaged in\nexamining some very handsome diamonds, which had no doubt been offered\nin lieu of money by some noble but impecunious foreigner. On hearing M.\nFortunat enter, the woman looked up.\n\n“What do you desire, monsieur?” she inquired, politely.\n\n“I wish to see Madame Lucy Huntley.”\n\nThe woman did not reply at first, but raised her eyes to the ceiling, as\nif she were reading there the list of all the foreigners of distinction\nwho honored the Hotel de Homburg by their presence at that moment. “Lucy\nHuntley!” she repeated. “I don’t recollect that name! I don’t think\nthere’s such a person in the house--Lucy Huntley! What kind of a person\nis she?”\n\nFor many reasons M. Fortunat could not answer. First of all, he did\nnot know. But he was not in the least disconcerted, and he avoided the\nquestion without the slightest embarrassment, at the same time trying to\nquicken the woman’s faulty memory. “The person I wished to see was here\non Friday, between three and six in the afternoon; and she was waiting\nfor a visitor with an anxiety which could not possibly have escaped your\nnotice.”\n\nThis detail quickened the memory of the man with the magnifying\nglass--none other than the woman’s husband and landlord of the hotel.\n“Ah! the gentleman is speaking of the lady of No. 2--you remember--the\nsame who insisted upon having the large private room.”\n\n“To be sure,” replied the wife; “where could my wits have been!” And\nturning to M. Fortunat: “Excuse my forgetfulness,” she added. “The lady\nis no longer in the house; she only remained here for a few hours.”\n\nThis reply did not surprise M. Fortunat--he had expected it; and yet\nhe assumed an air of the utmost consternation. “Only a few hours!” he\nrepeated, like a despairing echo.\n\n“Yes, monsieur. She arrived here about eleven o’clock in the morning,\nwith only a large valise by way of luggage, and she left that same\nevening at eight o’clock.”\n\n“Alas! and where was she going?”\n\n“She didn’t tell me.”\n\nYou might have sworn that M. Fortunat was about to burst into tears.\n“Poor Lucy!” said he, in a tragical tone; “it was for me, madame, that\nshe was waiting. But it was only this morning that I received her letter\nappointing a meeting here. She must have been in despair. The post can’t\nbe depended on!”\n\nThe husband and wife simultaneously shrugged their shoulders, and the\nexpression of their faces unmistakably implied: “What can we do about\nit? It is no business of ours. Don’t trouble us.”\n\nBut M. Fortunat was not the man to be dismayed by such a trifle.\n\n“She was taken to the railway station, no doubt,” he insisted.\n\n“Really, I know nothing about it.”\n\n“You told me just now that she had a large valise, so she could not have\nleft your hotel on foot. She must have asked for a vehicle. Who was\nsent to fetch it? One of your boys? If I could find the driver I should,\nperhaps, be able to obtain some valuable information from him.”\n\nThe husband and wife exchanged a whole volume of suspicions in a single\nglance. M. Isidore Fortunat’s appearance was incontestably respectable,\nbut they were well aware that those strange men styled detectives are\nperfectly conversant with the art of dressing to perfection. So the\nhotelkeeper quickly decided on his course. “Your idea is an excellent\none,” he said to M. Fortunat. “This lady must certainly have taken\na vehicle on leaving; and what is more, it must have been a vehicle\nbelonging to the hotel. If you will follow me, we will make some\ninquiries on the subject.”\n\nAnd rising with a willingness that augured well for their success,\nhe led the agent into the courtyard, where five or six vehicles were\nstationed, while the drivers lounged on a bench, chatting and smoking\ntheir pipes “Which of you was employed by a lady yesterday evening at\nabout eight o’clock?”\n\n“What sort of a person was she?”\n\n“She was a handsome woman, between thirty and forty years’ old, very\nfair, rather stout, and dressed in black. She had a large Russia-leather\ntravelling-bag.”\n\n“I took her,” answered one of the drivers promptly. M. Fortunat advanced\ntoward the man with open arms, and with such eagerness that it might\nhave been supposed he meant to embrace him. “Ah, my worthy fellow!” he\nexclaimed, “you can save my life!”\n\nThe driver looked exceedingly pleased. He was thinking that this\ngentleman would certainly requite his salvation by a magnificent\ngratuity. “What do you want of me?” he asked.\n\n“Tell me where you drove this lady?”\n\n“I took her to the Rue de Berry.”\n\n“To what number?”\n\n“Ah, I can’t tell. I’ve forgotten it.”\n\nBut M. Fortunat no longer felt any anxiety. “Very good,” said he.\n“You’ve forgotten it--that’s not at all strange. But you would know the\nhouse again, wouldn’t you?”\n\n“Undoubtedly I should.”\n\n“Will you take me there?”\n\n“Certainly, sir. This is my vehicle.”\n\nThe hunter of missing heirs at once climbed inside; but it was not until\nthe carriage had left the courtyard that the landlord returned to his\noffice. “That man must be a detective,” he remarked to his wife.\n\n“So I fancy.”\n\n“It’s strange we’re not acquainted with him. He must be a new member of\nthe force.”\n\nBut M. Fortunat was quite indifferent as to what impression he had left\nbehind him at the Hotel de Homburg, for he never expected to set foot\nthere again. The one essential thing was that he had obtained the\ninformation he wished for, and even a description of the lady, and he\nfelt that he was now really on the track. The vehicle soon reached the\nRue de Berry, and drew up in front of a charming little private house.\n“Here we are, monsieur,” said the driver, bowing at the door.\n\nM. Fortunat sprang nimbly on to the pavement, and handed five francs\nto the coachman, who went off growling and swearing, for he thought the\nreward a contemptibly small one, coming as it did from a man whose life\nhad been saved, according to his own confession. However, the person the\nJehu anathematized certainly did not hear him. Standing motionless where\nhe had alighted, M. Fortunat scrutinized the house in front of him with\nclose attention. “So she lives here,” he muttered. “This is the place;\nbut I can’t present myself without knowing her name. I must make some\ninquiries.”\n\nThere was a wine-shop some fifty paces distant, and thither M. Fortunat\nhastened, and ordered a glass of currant syrup. As he slowly sipped\nthe beverage, he pointed to the house in question, with an air of\nwell-assumed indifference, and asked: “Whom does that pretty dwelling\nbelong to?”\n\n“To Madame Lia d’Argeles,” answered the landlady.\n\nM. Fortunat started. He well remembered that this was the name the\nMarquis de Valorsay had mentioned when speaking of the vile conspiracy\nhe had planned. It was at this woman’s house that the man whom\nMademoiselle Marguerite loved had been disgraced! Still he managed to\nmaster his surprise, and in a light, frank tone he resumed: “What a\npretty name! And what does this lady do?”\n\n“What does she do? Why, she amuses herself.”\n\nM. Fortunat seemed astonished. “Dash it!” said he. “She must amuse\nherself to good purpose to have a house like that. Is she pretty?”\n\n“That depends on taste. She’s no longer young, at any rate; but she\nhas superb golden hair. And, oh! how white she is--as white as snow,\nmonsieur--as white as snow! She has a fine figure as well, and a most\ndistinguished bearing--pays cash, too, to the very last farthing.”\n\nThere could no longer be any doubt. The portrait sketched by the\nwine-vendor fully corresponded with the description given by the\nhotelkeeper in the Rue de Helder. Accordingly, M. Fortunat drained\nhis glass, and threw fifty centimes on the counter. Then, crossing the\nstreet, he boldly rang at the door of Madame d’Argeles’s house. If any\none had asked him what he proposed doing and saying if he succeeded in\neffecting an entrance, he might have replied with perfect sincerity, “I\ndon’t know.” The fact is, he had but one aim, one settled purpose in\nhis mind. He was obstinately, FURIOUSLY resolved to derive some benefit,\nsmall or great, from this mysterious affair. As for the means of\nexecution, he relied entirely on his audacity and sang-froid, convinced\nthat they would not fail him when the decisive moment came. “First of\nall, I must see this lady,” he said to himself. “The first words will\ndepend solely upon my first impressions. After that, I shall be guided\nby circumstances.”\n\nAn old serving-man, in a quiet, tasteful livery, opened the door,\nwhereupon M. Fortunat, in a tone of authority, asked: “Madame Lia\nd’Argeles?”\n\n“Madame does not receive on Friday,” was the reply.\n\nWith a petulant gesture, M. Fortunat rejoined: “All the same I must\nspeak with her to-day. It is on a matter of the greatest importance.\nGive her my card.” So saying, he held out a bit of pasteboard, on which,\nbelow his name, were inscribed the words: “Liquidations. Settlements\neffected for insolvent parties.”\n\n“Ah! that’s a different thing,” said the servant. “Will monsieur take\nthe trouble to follow me?”\n\nM. Fortunat did take the trouble; and he was conducted into a large\ndrawing-room where he was requested to sit down and await madame’s\ncoming. Left to himself, he began an inventory of the apartment, as a\ngeneral studies the ground on which he is about to give battle. No trace\nremained of the unfortunate scene of the previous night, save a broken\ncandelabrum on the chimney-piece. It was the one which Pascal Ferailleur\nhad armed himself with, when they talked of searching him, and which he\nhad thrown down in the courtyard, as he left the house. But this detail\ndid not attract M. Fortunat’s attention. The only thing that puzzled\nhim was the large reflector placed above the chandelier, and it took\nhim some time to fathom with what object it was placed there. Without\nprecisely intimidating him, the luxurious appointments of the house\naroused his astonishment. “Everything here is in princely style,” he\nmuttered, “and this shows that all the lunatics are not at Charenton\nyet. If Madame d’Argeles lacked bread in days gone by, she does so no\nlonger--that’s evident.”\n\nNaturally enough this reflection led him to wonder why such a rich woman\nshould become the Marquis de Valorsay’s accomplice, and lend a hand in\nso vile and cowardly a plot, which horrified even him--Fortunat. “For\nshe must be an accomplice,” he thought.\n\nAnd he marvelled at the freak of fate which had connected the\nunfortunate man who had been sacrificed with the unacknowledged\ndaughter, and the cast-off sister, of the Count de Chalusse. A vague\npresentiment, the mysterious voice of instinct, warned him, moreover,\nthat his profit in the affair would depend upon the antagonism, or\nalliance, of Mademoiselle Marguerite and Madame d’Argeles. But his\nmeditations were suddenly interrupted by the sound of a discussion in\nan adjoining room. He stepped eagerly forward, hoping to hear something,\nand he did hear a man saying in a coarse voice: “What! I leave an\ninteresting game, and lose precious time in coming to offer you my\nservices, and you receive me like this! Zounds! madame, this will teach\nme not to meddle with what doesn’t concern me, in future. So, good-bye,\nmy dear lady. You’ll learn some day, to your cost, the real nature of\nthis villain of a Coralth whom you now defend so warmly.”\n\nThis name of Coralth was also one of those which were engraven upon\nM. Fortunat’s memory; and yet he did not notice it at the moment. His\nattention was so absorbed by what he had just heard that he could not\nfix his mind upon the object of his mission; and he only abandoned his\nconjectures on hearing a rustling of skirts against the panels of the\ndoor leading into the hall.\n\nThe next moment Madame Lia d’Argeles entered the room. She was arrayed\nin a very elegant dressing-gown of gray cashmere, with blue satin\ntrimmings, her hair was beautifully arranged, and she had neglected none\nof the usual artifices of the toilette-table; still any one would have\nconsidered her to be over forty years of age. Her sad face wore an\nexpression of melancholy resignation; and there were signs of recent\ntears in her swollen eyes, surrounded by bluish circles. She glanced at\nher visitor, and, in anything but an encouraging tone exclaimed: “You\ndesired to speak with me, I believe?”\n\nM. Fortunat bowed, almost disconcerted. He had expected to meet one of\nthose stupid, ignorant young women, who make themselves conspicuous at\nthe afternoon promenade in the Bois de Boulogne; and he found himself in\nthe presence of an evidently cultivated and imperious woman, who,\neven in her degradation, retained all her pride of race, and awed him,\ndespite all his coolness and assurance. “I do, indeed, madame, wish to\nconfer with you respecting some important interests,” he answered.\n\nShe sank on to a chair; and, without asking her visitor to take a seat:\n“Explain yourself,” she said, briefly.\n\nM. Fortunat’s knowledge of the importance of the game in which he had\nalready risked so much had already restored his presence of mind. He\nhad only needed a glance to form a true estimate of Madame d’Argeles’s\ncharacter; and he realized that it would require a sudden, powerful, and\nwell-directed blow to shatter her composure. “I have the unpleasant duty\nof informing you of a great misfortune, madame,” he began. “A person who\nis very dear to you, and who is nearly related to you, was a victim of a\nfrightful accident yesterday evening and died this morning.”\n\nThis gloomy preamble did not seem to produce the slightest effect on\nMadame d’Argeles. “Whom are you speaking of?” she coldly asked.\n\nM. Fortunat assumed his most solemn manner as he replied: “Of your\nbrother, madame--of the Count de Chalusse.”\n\nShe sprang up, and a convulsive shudder shook her from head to foot.\n“Raymond is dead!” she faltered.\n\n“Alas! yes, madame. Struck with death at the very moment he was\nrepairing to the appointment you had given him at the Hotel de Homburg.”\n\nThis clever falsehood, which was not entirely one, would, so the agent\nthought, be of advantage to him, since it would prove he was acquainted\nwith previous events. But Madame d’Argeles did not seem to notice, or\neven to hear the remark. She had fallen back in her arm-chair, paler\nthan death. “How did he die?” she asked.\n\n“From an attack of apoplexy.”\n\n“My God!” exclaimed the wretched woman, who now suspected the truth; “my\nGod, forgive me. It was my letter that killed him!” and she wept as if\nher heart were breaking--this woman who had suffered and wept so much.\n\nIt is needless to say that M. Fortunat was moved with sympathy; he\nalways evinced a respectful sympathy for the woes of others; but in the\npresent instance, his emotion was greatly mitigated by the satisfaction\nhe felt at having succeeded so quickly and so completely. Madame\nd’Argeles had confessed everything! This was indeed a victory, for it\nmust be admitted that he had trembled lest she should deny all, and bid\nhim leave the house. He still saw many difficulties between his pocket\nand the Count de Chalusse’s money; but he did not despair of conquering\nthem after such a successful beginning. And he was muttering some words\nof consolation, when Madame d’Argeles suddenly looked up and said: “I\nmust see him--I will see him once more! Come, monsieur!” But a terrible\nmemory rooted her to the spot and with a despairing gesture, and in a\nvoice quivering with anguish she exclaimed:\n\n“No, no--I cannot even do that.”\n\nM. Fortunat was not a little disturbed; and it was with a look of\nsomething very like consternation that he glanced at Madame d’Argeles,\nwho had reseated herself and was now sobbing violently, with her face\nhidden on the arm of her chair. “What prevents her?” he thought. “Why\nthis sudden terror now that her brother is dead? Is she unwilling\nto confess that she is a Chalusse? She must make up her mind to it,\nhowever, if she wishes to receive the count’s property--and she must\nmake up her mind to it, for my sake, if not for her own.”\n\nHe remained silent, until it seemed to him that Madame d’Argeles was\ncalmer, then: “Excuse me, madame,” he began, “for breaking in upon\nyour very natural grief, but duty requires me to remind you of your\ninterests.”\n\nWith the passive docility of those who are wretched, she wiped away her\ntears, and replied, gently: “I am listening, monsieur.”\n\nHe had had time to prepare his discourse. “First of all, madame,” he\nremarked, “I must tell you that I was the count’s confidential agent. In\nhim I lose a protector. Respect alone prevents me from saying a friend.\nHe had no secrets from me.” M. Fortunat saw so plainly that Madame\nd’Argeles did not understand a word of this sentimental exordium that he\nthought it necessary to add: “I tell you this, not so much to gain\nyour consideration and good-will, as to explain to you how I became\nacquainted with these matters relating to your family--how I became\naware of your existence, for instance, which no one else suspected.” He\npaused, hoping for some reply, a word, a sign, but not receiving this\nencouragement, he continued: “I must, first of all, call your attention\nto the peculiar situation of M. de Chalusse, and to the circumstances\nwhich immediately preceded and attended his departure from life. His\ndeath was so unexpected that he was unable to make any disposition of\nhis property by will, or even to indicate his last wishes. This, madame,\nis fortunate for you. M. de Chalusse had certain prejudices against you,\nas you are aware. Poor count. He certainly had the best heart in the\nworld, and yet hatred with him was almost barbaric in its intensity.\nThere can be no doubt whatever, that he had determined to deprive you\nof your inheritance. With this intention he had already begun to convert\nhis estates into ready money, and had he lived six months longer you\nwould not have received a penny.”\n\nWith a gesture of indifference, which was difficult to explain after\nthe vehemence and the threatening tone of her letter, Madame d’Argeles\nmurmured:\n\n“Ah, well! what does it matter?”\n\n“What does it matter?” repeated M. Fortunat. “I see, madame, that your\ngrief prevents you from realizing the extent of the peril you have\nescaped. M. de Chalusse had other, and more powerful reasons even than\nhis hatred for wishing to deprive you of your share of his property.\nHe had sworn that he would give a princely fortune to his beloved\ndaughter.”\n\nFor the first time, Madame d’Argeles’s features assumed an expression of\nsurprise. “What, my brother had a child?”\n\n“Yes, madame, an illegitimate daughter, Mademoiselle Marguerite, a\nlovely and charming girl whom I had the pleasure of restoring to his\ncare some years ago. She has been living with him for six months or so;\nand he was about to marry her, with an enormous dowry, to a nobleman\nbearing one of the proudest names in France, the Marquis de Valorsay.”\n\nThe name shook Madame d’Argeles as if she had experienced the shock of\nan electric battery, and springing to her feet, with flashing eyes: “You\nsay that my brother’s daughter was to marry M. de Valorsay?” she asked.\n\n“It was decided--the marquis adored her.”\n\n“But she--she did not love him--confess that she did not love him.”\n\nM. Fortunat did not know what to reply. The question took him completely\nby surprise; and feeling that his answer would have a very considerable\ninfluence upon what might follow, he hesitated.\n\n“Will you answer me?” insisted Madame d’Argeles, imperiously. “She loved\nanother, did she not?”\n\n“To tell the truth, I believe she did,” the agent stammered. “But I have\nno proof of it, madame.”\n\n“Ah! the wretch!” she exclaimed with a threatening gesture; “the\ntraitor! the infamous scoundrel! Now I understand it all. And to think\nthat it occurred in my house. But no; it was best so, I can still repair\neverything.” And darting to the bell-rope, she pulled it violently.\n\nA servant at once appeared. “Job,” she said, “hasten after Baron\nTrigault--he left the house a moment ago and bring him back. I must\nspeak with him. If you do not overtake him, go to his club, to his\nhouse, to the houses of his friends, go to every place where there is\nany chance of finding him. Make haste, and do not return without him.”\n\nAnd as the man turned to obey, she added: “My carriage must be in the\ncourtyard. Take it.”\n\nMeanwhile M. Fortunat’s expression of countenance had undergone a marked\nchange. “Well!” thought he, “I have just made a mess of it! M. Valorsay\nis unmasked; and now, may I be hung, if he ever marries Mademoiselle\nMarguerite. Certainly, I do not owe much to the scoundrel, for he has\ndefrauded me of forty thousand francs, but what will he say when he\ndiscovers what I’ve done? He will never believe me if I tell him that it\nwas an involuntary blunder, and Heaven only knows what revenge he will\nplan! A man of his disposition, knowing that he is ruined, is capable\nof anything! So much the worse for me. Before night I shall warn the\ncommissary of police in my district, and I shall not go out unarmed!”\n\nThe servant went off, and Madame d’Argeles then turned to her visitor\nagain. But she seemed literally transfigured by the storm of passion\nwhich was raging in her heart and mind; her cheeks were crimson, and an\nunwonted energy sparkled in her eyes. “Let us finish this business,” she\nsaid, curtly; “I am expecting some one.”\n\nM. Fortunat bowed with a rather pompous, but at the same time obsequious\nair. “I have only a few more words to say,” he declared. “M. de Chalusse\nhaving no other heir, I have come to acquaint you with your rights.”\n\n“Very good; continue, if you please.”\n\n“You have only to present yourself, and establish your identity, to be\nput in possession of your brother’s property.”\n\nMadame d’Argeles gave the agent a look of mingled irony and distrust;\nand after a moment’s reflection, she replied: “I am very grateful\nfor your interest, monsieur; but if I have any rights, it is not my\nintention to urge them.”\n\nIt seemed to M. Fortunat as if he were suddenly falling from some\nimmense height. “You are not in earnest,” he exclaimed, “or you are\nignorant of the fact that M. de Chalusse leaves perhaps twenty millions\nbehind him.”\n\n“My course is decided on, monsieur; irrevocably decided on.”\n\n“Very well, madame; but it often happens that the court institutes\ninquiries for the heirs of large fortunes, and this may happen in your\ncase.”\n\n“I should reply that I was not a member of the Chalusse family, and that\nwould end it. Startled by the news of my brother’s death, I allowed my\nsecret to escape me. I shall know how to keep it in future.”\n\nAnger succeeded astonishment in M. Fortunat’s mind. “Madame, madame,\nwhat can you be thinking of?” he cried, impetuously. “Accept--in\nHeaven’s name--accept this inheritance; if not for yourself, for the\nsake of----”\n\nIn his excitement, he was about to commit a terrible blunder. He saw it\nin time, and checked himself.\n\n“For the sake of whom?” asked Madame d’Argeles, in an altered voice.\n\n“For the sake of Mademoiselle Marguerite, madame; for the sake of this\npoor child, who is your niece. The count never having acknowledged her\nas his daughter, she will be left actually without bread, while her\nfather’s millions go to enrich the state.”\n\n“That will suffice, monsieur; I will think of it. And now, enough!”\n\nThe dismissal was so imperious that M. Fortunat bowed and went off,\ncompletely bewildered by this denouement. “She’s crazy!” he said to\nhimself. “Crazy in the fullest sense of the word. She refuses the\ncount’s millions from a silly fear of telling people that she belongs\nto the Chalusse family. She threatened her brother, but she would never\nhave carried her threats into execution. And she prefers her present\nposition to such a fortune. What lunacy!” But, although he was\ndisappointed and angry, he did not by any means despair. “Fortunately\nfor me,” he thought, “this proud and haughty lady has a son somewhere\nin the world. And she’ll do for him what she would not consent to do for\nherself. Through her, with a little patience and Victor Chupin’s aid,\nI shall succeed in discovering this boy. He must be an intelligent\nyouth--and we’ll see if he surrenders his millions as easily as his\nmamma does.”\n\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\n\nIt is a terrible task to break suddenly with one’s past, without even\nhaving had time for preparation; to renounce the life one has so far\nlived, to return to the starting point, and begin existence anew; to\nabandon everything--the position one has gained, the work one has become\nfamiliar with, every fondly cherished hope, and friend, and habit; to\nforsake the known to plunge into the unknown, to leave the certain for\nthe uncertain, and desert light for darkness; to cast one’s identity\naside, assume a strange individuality, become a living lie, change name,\nposition, face, and clothes--in one phrase, to cease to be one’s self,\nin order to become some one else.\n\nThis is indeed, a terrible ordeal, and requires an amount of resolution\nand energy which few human beings possess. The boldest hesitate before\nsuch a sacrifice, and many a man has surrendered himself to justice\nrather than resort to this last extremity. And yet this was what\nPascal Ferailleur had the courage to do, on the morrow of the shameful\nconspiracy that had deprived him of his good name. When his mother’s\nexhortations and Baron Trigault’s encouraging words had restored his\nwonted clearness of perception, the only course he felt disposed to\npursue was to disappear and fly from the storm of slander and\ncontempt; and then, in a secure hiding-place, to watch for the time and\nopportunity of rehabilitation and revenge.\n\nMadame Ferailleur and her son made all needful arrangements. “I shall\nstart out at once,” said Pascal, “and before two hours have elapsed I\nshall have found a modest lodging, where we must conceal ourselves for\nthe present. I know a locality that will suit us, and where no one will\ncertainly ever think of looking for us.”\n\n“And I,” asked Madame Ferailleur, “what shall I do in the meantime?”\n\n“You, mother; you must, at once, sell all that we possess\nhere--everything--even my books. You will only keep such of our linen\nand clothes as you can pack in three or four trunks. We are undoubtedly\nwatched; and so it is of the utmost importance that every one should\nimagine I have left Paris, and that you are going to join me.”\n\n“And when everything is sold, and my trunks are ready?”\n\n“Then, mother, you must send some one for a cab, and order the driver to\ntake you to the Western Railway Station, where you will have the trunks\nremoved from the cab and placed in the baggage-room, as if you did not\nintend to leave Paris till the next day.”\n\n“Very good, I will do so; even if any one is watching us, he won’t be\nlikely to suspect this ruse. But afterward?”\n\n“Afterward, mother, you must go to the waiting-room upstairs, and you\nwill find me there. I will then take you to the rooms I shall have\nrented, and to-morrow we’ll send a messenger with the receipt the\nrailway people will give you, to fetch our luggage for us.”\n\nMadame Ferailleur approved of this plan, deeming herself fortunate in\nthis great calamity that despair had not destroyed her son’s energy and\nresources of mind. “Shall we retain our name, Pascal?”\n\n“Oh, no. That would be an unpardonable imprudence.”\n\n“What name shall we take, then? I must know, for they may ask me at the\nstation.”\n\nHe reflected for a moment and then said: “We’ll take your maiden name,\nmother. It will bring us good luck. Our new lodgings shall be hired in\nthe name of the Widow Maumejan.”\n\nThey talked for some time longer, anxious to take every precaution\nthat prudence could suggest. And when they were convinced that they had\nforgotten nothing, Madame Ferailleur suggested that Pascal should start\noff. But before doing so he had a sacred duty to perform. “I must warn\nMarguerite,” he muttered. And seating himself at his desk, he wrote his\nbeloved a concise and exact account of the events which had taken place.\nHe told her of the course he intended to pursue; and promised her\nthat she should know his new abode as soon as he knew it himself. In\nconclusion, he entreated her to grant him an interview, in which he\ncould give her the full particulars of the affair and acquaint her\nwith his hopes. As for exculpating himself, even by so much as a single\nword--as for explaining the snare he had been the victim of, the idea\nnever once occurred to him. He was worthy of Mademoiselle Marguerite;\nhe knew that not a doubt would disturb the perfect faith she had in his\nhonor.\n\nLeaning over her son’s shoulder, Madame Ferailleur read what he had\nwritten. “Do you intend to trust this letter to the post?” she\ninquired. “Are you sure, perfectly sure, that it will reach Mademoiselle\nMarguerite, and not some one else who might use it against you?”\n\nPascal shook his head. “I know how to insure its safe receipt,” he\nreplied. “Some time ago, Marguerite told me that if ever any great peril\nthreatened us, I might call for the housekeeper at the Chalusse mansion\nand intrust my message to her. The danger is sufficiently great to\njustify such a course in the present instance. So I shall pass down the\nRue de Courcelles, ask to see Madame Leon, and give her this letter.\nHave no fear, my dear mother.”\n\nAs he spoke, he began to pack all the legal documents which had been\nconfided to him into a large box, which was to be carried to one of his\nformer friends, who would distribute the papers among the people they\nbelonged to. He next made a small bundle of the few important private\npapers and valuables he possessed; and then, ready for the sacrifice,\nhe took a last survey of the pleasant home where success had smiled so\nfavorably upon his efforts, where he had been so happy, and where he\nhad cherished such bright dreams of the future. Overcome by a flood of\nrecollections, the tears sprang to his eyes. He embraced his mother, and\nfled precipitately from the house.\n\n“Poor child!” murmured Madame Ferailleur; “poor Pascal!”\n\nWas she not also to be pitied? This was the second time within twenty\nyears that a thunderbolt had fallen on her in the full sunlight of\nhappiness. And yet now, as on the day following her husband’s death, she\nfound in her heart the robust energy and heroic maternal constancy which\nenable one to rise above every misfortune. It was in a firm voice that\nshe ordered her servant to go in search of the nearest furniture dealer,\nno matter which, provided he would pay cash. And when the man arrived\nshe showed him through the rooms with stoical calmness. God alone knew\nhow intensely she was suffering. And yet while she was waiting for the\ndealer, each piece of furniture had acquired an extraordinary value in\nher eyes. It seemed to her as if each object were a part of herself, and\nwhen the man turned and twisted a chair or a table she almost considered\nit a personal affront.\n\nThe rich, who are accustomed from birth to the luxury that surrounds\nthem, are ignorant of the terrible sufferings which attend such cases\nas these. The persons who do suffer are those of the middle classes, not\nthe parvenus, but those who bid fair to become parvenus when misfortune\novertook them. Their hearts bleed when inexorable necessity deprives\nthem of all the little comforts with which they had gradually surrounded\nthemselves, for there is not an object that does not recall a long\nungratified desire, and the almost infantile joy of possession. What\nhappiness they felt on the day when they purchased that large arm-chair!\nHow many times they had gone to admire those velvet curtains in the\nshop windows before buying them! Those carpets represented months of\nself-denial. And that pretty clock--ah! they had fancied it would only\nherald the flight of prosperous and pleasant hours. And all these things\nthe dealer handles, and shakes, and jeers at, and depreciates. He will\nscarcely condescend to purchase. Who would care to buy such trash?\nHe knows that the owner is in need of money, and he profits by this\nknowledge. It is his business. “How much did this cost you?” he asks, as\nhe inspects one piece of furniture after another.\n\n“So much.”\n\n“Well, you must have been terribly cheated.”\n\nYou know very well that if there is a cheat in the world, it is this\nsame man; but what can you say? Any other dealer you might send for\nwould act in the same way. Now, Madame Ferailleur’s furniture had cost\nsome ten thousand francs; and, although it was no longer new, it was\nworth at least a third of that sum. But she obtained only seven hundred\nand sixty francs for it. It is true, however, that she was in haste, and\nthat she was paid cash.\n\nNine o’clock was striking when her trunks were at last piled on a cab,\nand she called out to the driver: “Take me to the Place du Havre--to the\nrailway station.” Once before, when defrauded by a scoundrel, she had\nbeen obliged to part with all her household treasures. Once before she\nhad left her home, taking merely the wreck of her fortune with her. But\nwhat a difference between then and now!\n\nThen, the esteem and sympathy of all who knew her was hers, and the\nadmiring praise she received divested the sacrifice of much of its\nbitterness, and increased her courage two-fold. Now, she was flying\nsecretly, and alone, under an assumed name, trembling at the thought\nof pursuit or recognition--flying as a criminal flies at thought of his\ncrime, and fear of punishment. She had far less suffered on the day,\nwhen, with her son upon her knees, she journeyed to the cemetery,\nfollowing all that was mortal of the man who had been her only thought,\nher love, her pride, her happiness, and hope. Though crushed by the\nsense of her irreparable loss, she had not rebelled against the hand\nthat struck her; but now it was human wickedness that assailed her\nthrough her son, and her suffering was like that of the innocent man who\nperishes for want of power to prove his innocence. Her husband’s death\nhad not caused her such bitter tears as her son’s dishonor. She who was\nso proud, and who had such good reason to be proud, she could note the\nglances of scorn she was favored with as she left her home. She heard\nthe insulting remarks made by some of her neighbors, who, like so many\nfolks, found their chief delight in other people’s misfortunes.\n\n“Crocodile tears,” some had exclaimed. “She is going to meet her son;\nand with what he has stolen they will live like princes in America.”\n Rumor, which enlarges and misrepresents everything, had, indeed,\nabsurdly exaggerated the affair at Madame d’Argeles’s house. It was\nreported in the Rue d’Ulm that Pascal had spent every night at the\ngaming table for more than five years; and that, being an incomparable\ntrickster, he had stolen millions.\n\nMeanwhile, Madame Ferailleur was approaching the station. The cab horse\nsoon slackened its pace to climb the acclivity of the Rue d’Amsterdam;\nand shortly afterward the vehicle drew up in the courtyard of the\nrailway station. Faithfully observing the directions which had been\ngiven her, the worthy woman had her trunks taken to the baggage-room,\ndeclaring that she should not leave Paris until the next day, whereupon\nshe received a receipt from the man in charge of the room. She was\noppressed by vague apprehensions, and looked closely at every one who\npassed her; fearing the presence of spies, and knowing full well that\nthe most profound secrecy could alone insure the success of Pascal’s\nplans. However, she did not see a single suspicious looking person.\nSome Englishmen--those strange travellers, who are at the same time so\nfoolishly prodigal and so ridiculously miserly--were making a great hue\nand cry over the four sous gratuity claimed by a poor commissionaire;\nbut these were the only persons in sight.\n\nPartially reassured, Madame Ferailleur hastily ascended the staircase,\nand entered the large waiting-room. It was here that Pascal had promised\nto meet her; but, though she looked round on all sides, she did not\nperceive him. Still, this delay did not alarm her much; nor was it at\nall strange, since Pascal had scarcely known what he would have to do\nwhen he left the house. She seated herself on a bench, as far back in\nthe shade as possible and gazed sadly at the ever-changing throng, when\nall of a sudden she was startled by a man, who abruptly paused in front\nof her. This man proved to be Pascal. But his hair had been closely cut,\nand he had shaved off his beard. And thus shorn, with his smooth face,\nand with a brown silk neckerchief in lieu of the white muslin tie he\nusually wore, he was so greatly changed that for an instant his own\nmother did not recognize him. “Well?” asked Madame Ferailleur, as she\nrealized his identity.\n\n“I have succeeded. We have secured such rooms as I wished for.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Ah!--a long way off, my poor mother--many a league from those we have\nknown and loved--in a thinly populated part of the suburbs, on the Route\nde la Revolte, just outside the fortifications, and almost at the point\nwhere it intersects the Asnieres road. You will not be very comfortable\nthere, but you will have the pleasure of a little garden.”\n\nShe rose, summoning all her energy. “What does it matter where or what\nour abode is?” she interrupted, with forced gayety. “I am confident that\nwe shall not remain there long.”\n\nBut it seemed as if her son did not share her hopes, for he remained\nsilent and dejected; and as his mother observed him closely, she fancied\nby the expression of his eyes, that some new anxiety had been added to\nall his other troubles.\n\n“What is the matter?” she inquired, unable to master her alarm--“what\nhas happened?”\n\n“Ah! a great misfortune!”\n\n“My God! still another?”\n\n“I have been to the Rue de Courcelles; and I have spoken to Madame\nLeon.”\n\n“What did she say?”\n\n“The Count de Chalusse died this morning.”\n\nMadame Ferailleur drew a long breath, as if greatly relieved. She was\ncertainly expecting to hear something very different, and she did\nnot understand why this death should be a great misfortune to them\npersonally. One point, however, she did realize, that it was imprudent,\nand even dangerous, to carry on this conversation in a hall where a\nhundred persons were passing and repassing every minute. So she took her\nson’s arm, and led him away, saying: “Come, let us go.”\n\nPascal had kept the cab which he had been using during the afternoon;\nand having installed his mother inside, he got in himself, and gave his\nnew address to the driver. “Now tell me all,” said Madame Ferailleur.\n\nPoor Pascal was in that state of mind in which it costs one actual\nsuffering to talk; but he wished to mitigate his mother’s anxiety as\nmuch as possible; and moreover, he did not like her to suppose him\nwanting in endurance. So, with a powerful effort, he shook off the\nlethargy that was creeping over him, and in a voice loud enough to be\nheard above the noise of the carriage wheels, he began: “This is what\nI have done, mother, since I left you. I remembered that some time ago,\nwhile I was appraising some property, I had seen three or four houses\non the Route de la Revolte, admirably suited to our present wants.\nNaturally I went there first. A suite of rooms was vacant in one of\nthese houses. I have taken it; and in order that nothing may interfere\nwith the liberty of my movements, I have paid six months’ rent in\nadvance. Here is the receipt, drawn up in the name we shall henceforth\nbear.” So saying, he showed his mother a document in which the landlord\ndeclared that he had received from M. Maumejan the sum of three hundred\nand fifty francs for two quarters’ rent, etc. “My bargain concluded,” he\nresumed, “I returned into Paris, and entered the first furniture shop\nI saw. I meant to hire the necessary things to furnish our little\nhome, but the dealer made all sorts of objections. He trembled for his\nfurniture, he wanted a sum of money to be deposited as security, or the\nguarantee of three responsible business men. Seeing this, and knowing\nthat I had no time to lose, I preferred to purchase such articles as\nwere absolutely necessary. One of the conditions of the purchase was\nthat everything should be in the house and in its place by eleven\no’clock to-night. As I stipulated in writing that the dealer should\nforfeit three hundred francs in case he failed to fulfil his agreement,\nI can rely upon his punctuality; I confided the key of our lodgings to\nhim, and he must now be there waiting for us.”\n\nSo, before thinking of his love, and Mademoiselle Marguerite, Pascal had\ntaken the necessary measures for the execution of his plan to regain his\nlost honor. Madame Ferailleur had scarcely supposed him capable of so\nmuch courage and firmness, and she rewarded him with a warm pressure of\nthe hand. Then, as he was silent: “When did you see Madame Leon, then?”\n she asked.\n\n“When all the household arrangements were completed, mother. On leaving\nthe furniture-shop, I found that I had still an hour and a quarter\nbefore me. I could defer no longer, and at the risk of obliging you to\nwait for me, I hastened to the Rue de Courcelles.”\n\nIt was evident that Pascal felt extreme embarrassment in speaking of\nMademoiselle Marguerite. There is an instinctive delicacy and dislike of\npublicity in all deep passion, and true and chaste love is ever\naverse to laying aside the veil with which it conceals itself from the\ninquisitive. Madame Ferailleur understood this feeling; but she was a\nmother, and as such, jealous of her son’s tenderness, and anxious for\nparticulars concerning this rival who had suddenly usurped her place in\nthe heart where she had long reigned supreme. She was also a woman--that\nis to say, distrustful and suspicious in reference to all other women.\nSo, without taking pity on Pascal’s embarrassment, she urged him to\ncontinue.\n\n“I gave the driver five francs on condition that he would hurry his\nhorses,” he resumed, “and we were rattling along at a rapid rate, when,\nsuddenly, near the Hotel de Chalusse, I noticed a change in the motion\nof the vehicle. I looked out and saw that we were driving over a thick\nlayer of straw which had been spread across the street. I can scarcely\ndescribe my feelings on seeing this. A cold perspiration came over me--I\nfancied I saw Marguerite in agony, dying--far from me, and calling me in\nvain. Without waiting for the vehicle to stop, I sprang to the ground,\nand was obliged to exercise all my self-control to prevent myself from\nrushing into the concierge’s lodge, and wildly asking: ‘Who is dying\nhere?’ But an unforeseen difficulty presented itself. It was evident\nthat I ought not to go in person to inquire for Madame Leon. Whom could\nI send? There were no commissionaires at the street corners, and nothing\nwould have induced me to confide the message to any of the lads in the\nneighboring wine-shops. Fortunately, my driver--the same who is driving\nus now--is an obliging fellow, and I intrusted him with the commission,\nwhile I stood guard over his horses. Ten minutes later, Madame Leon left\nthe house and came to meet me. I knew her at once, for I had seen her a\nhundred times with Marguerite when they lived near the Luxembourg; and\nhaving seen me pass and repass so often, she recognized me in spite\nof my changed appearance. Her first words, ‘M. de Chalusse is dead,’\nrelieved my heart of a terrible weight. I could breathe again. But she\nwas in such haste that she could not stop to tell me any particulars.\nStill I gave her my letter, and she promised me a prompt reply from\nMarguerite. Everybody will be up and moving about the house to-night,\nand she said she could easily make her escape for a few moments. So, at\nhalf-past twelve to-night she will be at the little garden gate, and if\nI am promptly at hand, I shall have a reply from Marguerite.”\n\nMadame Ferailleur seemed to be expecting something more, and as Pascal\nremained silent, she remarked: “You spoke of a great misfortune. In what\ndoes it consist? I do not perceive it.”\n\nWith an almost threatening gesture, and in a gloomy voice, he answered:\n“The misfortune is this: if it had not been for this abominable\nconspiracy, which has dishonored me, Marguerite would have been my wife\nbefore a month had elapsed, for now she is free, absolutely free to obey\nthe dictates of her own will and heart.”\n\n“Then why do you complain?”\n\n“Oh, mother! don’t you understand? How can I marry her? Would it be\nright for me to think of offering her a dishonored name? It seems to me\nthat I should be guilty of a most contemptible act--of something even\nworse than a crime--if I dared speak to her of my love and our future\nbefore I have crushed the villains who have ruined me.”\n\nRegret, anger, and the consciousness of his present powerlessness drew\nfrom him tears which fell upon Madame Ferailleur’s heart like molten\nlead; but she succeeded in concealing her agony. “All the more reason,”\n she answered, almost coldly, “why you should not lose a second, but\ndevote all your energy and intelligence to the work of justification.”\n\n“Oh, I shall have my revenge, never fear. But in the meantime, what is\nto become of HER? Think, mother, she is alone in the world, without a\nsingle friend. It is enough to drive one mad!”\n\n“She loves you, you tell me. What have you to fear? Now she will be\nfreed from the persecutions of the suitor they intended to force upon\nher, whom she has spoken to you about--the Marquis de Valorsay, is it\nnot?”\n\nThis name sent Pascal’s blood to his brain. “Ah, the scoundrel!” he\nexclaimed. “If there was a God in heaven----”\n\n“Wretched boy!” interrupted Madame Ferailleur; “you blaspheme when\nProvidence has already interposed on your behalf. And who suffers most\nat this moment, do you think?--you, strong in your innocence, or the\nmarquis, who realizes that he has committed an infamous crime in vain?”\n\nThe sudden stopping of the cab put an end to their conversation.\nLeaving the Route d’Asnieres, the driver had turned into the Route de la\nRevolte, and had drawn up in front of an unpretentious two-storied house\nwhich stood entirely alone. “We have arrived, mother,” said Pascal.\n\nA man, who was standing on the threshold, stepped forward to open\nthe cab door. It was the furniture-dealer. “Here you are at last,\nM. Maumejan,” said he. “Come in, and you’ll see that I’ve strictly\nfulfilled the conditions of our contract.” His words proved true. He was\npaid the sum stipulated, and went away satisfied.\n\n“Now, my dear mother,” said Pascal, “allow me to do the honors of the\npoor abode I have selected.”\n\nHe had taken only the ground floor of this humble dwelling. The story\nabove, which had an independent entrance and staircase, was occupied\nby the quiet family of the owner. Although the space was small, the\narchitect had made the most of it. He had divided it into four small\nrooms, separated by a corridor; and the kitchen looked out upon a little\ngarden about four times as large as an ordinary sheet. The furniture\nwhich Pascal had purchased was more than plain; but it was well suited\nto this humble abode. It had just been brought in, but any one would\nhave supposed it had been in its place for a couple of years.\n\n“We shall be very comfortable here,” declared Madame Ferailleur. “Yes,\nvery comfortable. By to-morrow evening you won’t recognize the place.\nI have saved a few trifles from the wreck--some curtains, a couple of\nlamps, a clock--you’ll see. It’s wonderful how much four trunks can be\nmade to hold.”\n\nWhen his mother set him such a noble example Pascal would have blushed\nto allow himself to be outdone. He very quietly explained the reasons\nwhich had influenced him in choosing these rooms, the principal one\nbeing that there was no concierge, and he was therefore assured absolute\nliberty in his movements, as well as entire immunity from indiscreet\ngossip. “Certainly, my dear mother,” he added, “it is a lonely and\nunattractive neighborhood; but you will find all the necessaries of life\nnear at hand. The owner of the house lives on the floor above. I have\ntalked with the wife--they seem to be honest, quiet people--and she will\npilot you about. I inquired for some one to do the heavy work, and she\nmentioned a poor woman named Vantrasson, who lives in the neighborhood,\nand who is anxious to obtain employment. They were to inform her this\nevening, and you will see her to-morrow. And above all, don’t forget\nthat you are henceforth Madame Maumejan.”\n\nOccupied with these arrangements for the future, he was still talking,\nwhen Madame Ferailleur, drawing out her watch, gently remarked: “And\nyour appointment? You forget that the cab is waiting at the door.”\n\nIt was true; he had forgotten it. He caught up his hat, hastily\nembraced his mother, and sprang into the vehicle. The horses were almost\nexhausted, but the driver was so willing that he found a means of making\nthem trot as far as the Rue de Courcelles. However, on arriving there,\nhe declared that his animals and himself could endure no more, and after\nreceiving the amount due to him, he departed.\n\nThe air was chilly, the night dark, and the street deserted. The gloomy\nsilence was only disturbed at long intervals by the opening or shutting\nof a door, or by the distant tread of some belated pedestrian. Having at\nleast twenty minutes to wait, Pascal sat down on the curbstone opposite\nthe Hotel de Chalusse, and fixed his eyes upon the building as if he\nwere striving to penetrate the massive walls, and see what was passing\nwithin. Only one window--that of the room where the dead man was\nlying--was lighted up, and he could vaguely distinguish the motionless\nform of a woman standing with her forehead pressed against the pane\nof glass. A prey to the indescribable agony which seizes a man when\nhe feels that his life is at stake--that his future is about to be\nirrevocably decided--Pascal counted the seconds as they passed by. He\nfound it impossible to reflect, to deliberate, to decide on any plan\nof action. He forgot the tortures he had endured during the last\ntwenty-four hours; Coralth, Valorsay, Madame d’Argeles, the baron, no\nlonger existed for him. He forgot his loss of honor and position, and\nthe disgrace attached to his name. The past was annihilated, as it\nwere, and he could think of no future beyond the next few moments. His\nphysical condition undoubtedly contributed to his mental weakness. He\nhad taken no food that day, and he was faint from want of nourishment.\nHe had come without an overcoat, moreover, and the cold night air\nchilled him to the bone. There was a strange ringing in his ears, and\na mist swam before his eyes. At last the bell at the Beaujon Hospital\ntolled the appointed hour, and roused him from his lethargy. He seemed\nto hear a voice crying to him in the darkness, “Up! the hour has come!”\n\nTrembling, and with tottering limbs, he dragged himself to the little\ngate opening into the gardens of the Chalusse mansion. Soon it softly\nopened, and Madame Leon appeared. Ah! it was not she that Pascal had\nhoped to see. Unfortunate man! He had been listening to that mysterious\necho of our own desires which we so often mistake for a presentiment;\nand it had whispered in his heart: “Marguerite herself will come!”\n\nWith the candor of wretchedness, he could not refrain from telling\nMadame Leon the hope he had entertained. But, on hearing him, the\nhousekeeper recoiled with a gesture of outraged propriety, and\nreproachfully exclaimed: “What are you thinking of, monsieur? What!\ncould you suppose that Mademoiselle Marguerite would abandon her place\nby her dead father’s bedside to come to a rendezvous? Ah! you should\nthink better of her than that, the dear child!”\n\nHe sighed deeply, and in a scarcely audible voice, he asked: “Hasn’t she\neven sent me a reply?”\n\n“Yes, monsieur, she has; and although it is a great indiscretion on my\npart, I bring you the letter. Here it is. Now, good-evening. I must go\nat once. What would become of me if the servants discovered my absence,\nand found that I had gone out alone----”\n\nShe was hurrying away, but Pascal detained her. “Pray wait until I see\nwhat she has written,” he said, imploringly. “I shall perhaps be obliged\nto send her some message in reply.”\n\nMadame Leon obeyed, though with rather bad grace, and not without\nseveral times repeating: “Make haste!”--while Pascal ran to a street\nlamp near by. It was not a letter that Marguerite had sent him, but\na short note, written on a scrap of crumpled paper, folded, and not\nsealed. It was written in pencil; and the handwriting was irregular and\nindistinct. Still, by the flickering light of the gas, Pascal deciphered\nthe word “Monsieur.” It made him shudder. “Monsieur!” What did this\nmean? In writing to him of recent times, Marguerite had always said, “My\ndear Pascal,” or, “My friend.”\n\nNevertheless, he continued: “I have not had the courage to resist the\nentreaties made to me by the Count de Chalusse, my father, in his last\nagony. I have solemnly pledged myself to become the wife of the Marquis\nde Valorsay.\n\n“One cannot break a promise made to the dying. I shall keep mine, even\nthough my heart break. I shall do my duty. God will give me strength and\ncourage. Forget her whom you loved. She is now the betrothed of another,\nand honor commands her to forget your very name. Once more, and for the\nlast time, farewell! If you love me, you will not try to see me again.\nIt would only add to my misery.\n\n“Think as though she were dead--she who signs herself--MARGUERITE.”\n\nThe commonplace wording of this letter, and the mistakes in spelling\nthat marred it, entirely escaped Pascal’s notice. He only understood one\nthing, that Marguerite was lost to him, and that she was on the point of\nbecoming the wife of the vile scoundrel who had planned the snare which\nhad ruined him at the Hotel d’Argeles. Breathless, despairing, and half\ncrazed with rage, he sprang toward Madame Leon. “Marguerite, where is\nshe?” he demanded, in a hoarse, unnatural voice; “I must see her!”\n\n“Oh! monsieur, what do you ask? Is it possible? Allow me to explain\nto you----” But the housekeeper was unable to finish her sentence, for\nPascal had caught her by the hands, and holding them in a vicelike grip,\nhe repeated: “I must see Marguerite, and speak to her. I must tell her\nthat she has been deceived; I will unmask the scoundrel who----”\n\nThe frightened housekeeper struggled with all her might, trying her best\nto reach the little gate which was standing open. “You hurt me!” she\ncried. “Are you mad? Let me go or I shall call for help?” And twice\nindeed she shouted in a loud voice, “Help! murder!”\n\nBut her cries were lost in the stillness of the night. If any one\nheard them, no one came; still they recalled Pascal to a sense of the\nsituation, and he was ashamed of his violence. He released Madame Leon,\nand his manner suddenly became as humble as it had been threatening.\n“Excuse me,” he said, entreatingly. “I am suffering so much that I\ndon’t know what I’m doing. I beseech you to take me to Mademoiselle\nMarguerite, or else run and beg her to come here. I ask but a moment.”\n\nMadame Leon pretended to be listening attentively; but, in reality, she\nwas quietly manoeuvring to gain the garden gate. Soon she succeeded in\ndoing so, whereupon, with marvellous strength and agility, she pushed\nPascal away, and sprang inside the garden, closing the gate after her,\nand saying as she did so, “Begone, you scoundrel!”\n\nThis was the final blow; and for more than a minute Pascal stood\nmotionless in front of the gate, stupefied with mingled rage and sorrow.\nHis condition was not unlike that of a man who, after falling to the\nbottom of a precipice, is dragging himself up, all mangled and bleeding,\nswearing that he will yet save himself, when suddenly a heavy stone\nwhich he had loosened in his descent, falls forward and crushes him. All\nthat he had so far endured was nothing in comparison with the thought\nthat Valorsay would wed Marguerite. Was such a thing possible? Would\nGod permit such a monstrous iniquity? “No, that shall never be,” he\nmuttered. “I will murder the scoundrel rather; and afterward justice may\ndo whatever it likes with me.”\n\nHe experienced that implacable, merciless thirsting for vengeance\nwhich does not even recoil before the commission of a crime to secure\nsatisfaction, and this longing inflamed him with such energy that,\nalthough he had been so utterly exhausted a few moments before--he was\nnot half an hour in making his way back to his new home. His mother, who\nwas waiting for him with an anxious heart, was surprised by the flush\non his cheeks, and the light glittering in his eyes. “Ah, you bring good\nnews,” she exclaimed.\n\nHis only answer was to hand her the letter which Madame Leon had given\nhim, saying as he did so, “Read.”\n\nMadame Ferailleur’s eyes fell upon the words: “Once more, and for the\nlast time, farewell!” She understood everything, turned very pale, and\nin a trembling voice exclaimed: “Don’t grieve, my son; the girl did not\nlove you.”\n\n“Oh, mother! if you knew----”\n\nBut she checked him with a gesture, and lifting her head proudly, she\nsaid: “I know what it is to love, Pascal--it is to have perfect faith.\nIf the whole world had accused your father of a crime, would a single\ndoubt of his innocence have ever entered my mind? This girl has doubted\nyou. They have told her that you cheated at cards--and she has believed\nit. You have failed to see that this oath at the bedside of the dying\ncount is only an excuse.”\n\nIt was true; the thought had not occurred to Pascal. “My God!” he cried\nin agony; “are you the only one who believes in my innocence?”\n\n“Without proofs--yes. It must be your task to obtain these proofs.”\n\n“And I shall obtain them,” he rejoined, in a tone of determination. “I\nam strong now that I have Marguerite’s life to defend--for they have\ndeceived her, mother, or she would never have given me up. Oh! don’t\nshake your head. I love her, and so I trust her.”\n\n\n\n\nXVII.\n\n\nM. Isidore Fortunat was not the man to go to sleep over a plan when it\nwas once formed. Whenever he said to himself, “I’ll do this, or that,”\n he did it as soon as possible--that very evening, rather than the next\nday. Having sworn that he would find out Madame d’Argeles’s son, the\nheir to the Count de Chalusse’s millions, it did not take him long\nto decide which of his agents he would select to assist him in this\ndifficult task. Thus his first care, on returning home, was to ask his\nbookkeeper for Victor Chupin’s address.\n\n“He lives in the Faubourg Saint-Denis,” replied the bookkeeper, “at\nNo.--.”\n\n“Very well,” muttered M. Fortunat; “I’ll go there as soon as I have\neaten my dinner.” And, indeed, as soon as he had swallowed his coffee,\nhe requested Madame Dodelin to bring him his overcoat, and half an hour\nlater he reached the door of the house where his clerk resided.\n\nThe house was one of those huge, ungainly structures, large enough\nto shelter the population of a small village, with three or four\ncourtyards, as many staircases as there are letters in the alphabet,\nand a concierge who seldom remembers the names of the tenants except on\nquarter-days when he goes to collect the rent, and at New Year, when he\nexpects a gratuity. But, by one of those lucky chances made expressly\nfor M. Fortunat, the porter did recollect Chupin, knew him and was\nkindly disposed toward him, and so he told the visitor exactly how and\nwhere to find him. It was very simple. He had only to cross the first\ncourtyard, take staircase D, on the left-hand side, ascend to the sixth\nfloor, go straight ahead, etc., etc.\n\nThanks to this unusual civility, M. Fortunat did not lose his way more\nthan five times before reaching the door upon which was fastened a bit\nof pasteboard bearing Victor Chupin’s name. Noticing that a bell-rope\nhung beside the door, M. Fortunat pulled it, whereupon there was a\ntinkling, and a voice called out, “Come in!” He complied, and found\nhimself in a small and cheaply furnished room, which was, however,\nradiant with the cleanliness which is in itself a luxury. The waxed\nfloor shone like a mirror; the furniture was brilliantly polished, and\nthe counterpane and curtains of the bed were as white as snow. What\nfirst attracted the agent’s attention was the number of superfluous\narticles scattered about the apartment--some plaster statuettes on\neither side of a gilt clock, an etagere crowded with knickknacks, and\nfive or six passable engravings. When he entered, Victor Chupin was\nsitting, in his shirt-sleeves, at a little table, where, by the light of\na small lamp, and with a zeal that brought a flush to his cheeks, he was\ncopying, in a very fair hand a page from a French dictionary. Near the\nbed, in the shade, sat a poorly but neatly clad woman about forty years\nof age, who was knitting industriously with some long wooden needles.\n\n“M. Victor Chupin?” inquired M. Fortunat.\n\nThe sound of his voice made the young man spring to his feet. He quickly\nlifted the shade from his lamp, and, without attempting to conceal his\nastonishment, exclaimed: “M’sieur Fortunat!--at this hour! Where’s\nthe fire?” Then, in a grave manner that contrasted strangely with\nhis accustomed levity: “Mother,” said he, “this is one of my patrons,\nM’sieur Fortunat--you know--the gentleman whom I collect for.”\n\nThe knitter rose, bowed respectfully, and said: “I hope, sir, that you\nare pleased with my son, and that he’s honest.”\n\n“Certainly, madame,” replied the agent; “certainly. Victor is one of my\nbest and most reliable clerks.”\n\n“Then I’m content,” said the woman, reseating herself.\n\nChupin also seemed delighted “This is my good mother, sir,” said he.\n“She’s almost blind now; but, in less than six months she will be able\nto stand at her window and see a pin in the middle of the street, so\nthe physician who is treating her eyes promised me; then we shall be\nall right again. But take a seat, sir. May we venture to offer you\nanything?”\n\nAlthough his clerk had more than once alluded to his responsibilities,\nM. Fortunat was amazed. He marvelled at the perfume of honesty which\nexhaled from these poor people, at the dignity of this humble woman, and\nat the protecting and respectful affection evinced by her son--a young\nman, whose usual tone of voice and general behavior had seemed to\nindicate that he was decidedly a scapegrace. “Thanks, Victor,” he\nreplied, “I won’t take any refreshment. I’ve just left the dinner-table.\nI’ve come to give you my instructions respecting a very important and\nvery urgent matter.”\n\nChupin at once understood that his employer wished for a private\ninterview. Accordingly, he took up the lamp, opened a door, and, in the\npompous tone of a rich banker who is inviting some important personage\nto enter his private room, he said: “Will you be kind enough to step\ninto my chamber, m’sieur?”\n\nThe room which Chupin so emphatically denominated his “chamber” was a\ntiny nook, extraordinarily clean, it is true, but scantily furnished\nwith a small iron bedstead, a trunk, and a chair. He offered the chair\nto his visitor, placed the lamp on the trunk, and seated himself on the\nbed, saying as he did so: “This is scarcely on so grand a scale as your\nestablishment, m’sieur; but I am going to ask the landlord to gild the\nwindow of my snuff-box.”\n\nM. Fortunat was positively touched. He held out his hand to his clerk\nand exclaimed: “You’re a worthy fellow, Chupin.”\n\n“Nonsense, m’sieur, one does what one can; but, zounds! how hard it is\nto make money honestly! If my good mother could only see, she would\nhelp me famously, for there is no one like her for work! But you see one\ncan’t become a millionaire by knitting!”\n\n“Doesn’t your father live with you?”\n\nChupin’s eyes gleamed angrily. “Ah! don’t speak of that man to me,\nm’sieur!” he exclaimed, “or I shall hurt somebody.” And then, as if he\nfelt it necessary to explain and excuse his vindictive exclamation, he\nadded: “My father, Polyte Chupin, is a good-for-nothing scamp. And yet\nhe’s had his opportunities. First, he was fortunate enough to find a\nwife like my mother, who is honesty itself--so much so that she was\ncalled Toinon the Virtuous when she was young. She idolized him, and\nnearly killed herself by working to earn money for him. And yet he\nabused her so much, and made her weep so much, that she has become\nblind. But that’s not all. One morning there came to him--I don’t know\nwhence or how--enough money for him to have lived like a gentleman. I\nbelieve it was a munificent reward for some service he had rendered a\ngreat nobleman at the time when my grandmother, who is now dead, kept a\ndramshop called the Poivriere. Any other man would have treasured that\nmoney, but not he. What he did was to carouse day and night, and all the\nwhile my poor mother was working her fingers to the bone to earn food\nfor me. She never saw a penny of all his money; and, indeed, once when\nshe asked him to pay the rent, he beat her so cruelly that she was laid\nup in bed for a week. However, monsieur, you can very readily understand\nthat when a man leads that kind of life, he speedily comes to the end of\nhis banking account. So my father was soon without a penny in his purse,\nand then he was obliged to work in order to get something to eat, and\nthis didn’t suit him at all. But when he didn’t know where to find a\ncrust he remembered us; he sought us out, and found us. Once I lent him\na hundred sous; the next day he came for forty more, and the next for\nthree francs; then for five francs again. And so it was every day: ‘Give\nme this, or give me that!’ At last I said, ‘Enough of this, the bank’s\nclosed!’ Then, what do you think he did? He watched the house until he\nsaw me go out; then he came in with a second-hand furniture-dealer,\nand tried to sell everything, pretending that he was the master. And\nmy poor, dear mother would have allowed him to do it. Fortunately, I\nhappened to come in again. Let him sell my furniture? Not I. I would\nsooner have been chopped in pieces! I went and complained to the\ncommissary of police, who made my father leave the house, and since then\nwe’ve lived in peace.”\n\nCertainly this was more than sufficient to explain and excuse Victor\nChupin’s indignation. And yet he had prudently withheld the most serious\nand important cause of his dislike. What he refrained from telling\nwas that years before, when he was still a mere child, without will or\ndiscernment, his father had taken him from his mother, and had started\nhim down that terrible descent, which inevitably leads one to prison or\nthe gallows, unless there be an almost miraculous interposition on one’s\nbehalf. This miracle had occurred in Chupin’s case; but he did not boast\nof it.\n\n“Come, come!” said M. Fortunat, “don’t worry too much about it. A\nfather’s a father after all, and yours will undoubtedly reform by and\nby.”\n\nHe said this as he would have said anything else, out of politeness and\nfor the sake of testifying a friendly interest; but he really cared no\nmore for this information concerning the Chupin family than the grand\nTurk. His first emotion had quickly vanished; and he was beginning to\nfind these confidential disclosures rather wearisome. “Let us get back\nto business,” he remarked; “that is to say, to Casimir. What did you do\nwith the fool after my departure?”\n\n“First, monsieur, I sobered him; which was no easy task. The greedy\nidiot had converted himself into a wine-cask! At last, however, when he\ncould talk as well as you and I, and walk straight, I took him back to\nthe Hotel de Chalusse.”\n\n“That was right. But didn’t you have some business to transact with\nhim?”\n\n“That’s been arranged, monsieur; the agreement has been signed. The\ncount will have the best of funerals--the finest hearse out, with six\nhorses, twenty-four mourning coaches--a grand display, in fact. It will\nbe worth seeing.”\n\nM. Fortunat smiled graciously. “That ought to bring you a handsome\ncommission,” he said, benignly.\n\nEmployed by the job, Chupin was the master of his own time, free to\nutilize his intelligence and industry as he chose, but M. Fortunat did\nnot like his subordinates to make any money except through him. Hence\nhis approval, in the present instance, was so remarkable that it\nawakened Chupin’s suspicions. “I shall make a few sous, probably,” he\nmodestly replied, “a trifle to aid my good mother in keeping the pot\nboiling.”\n\n“So much the better, my boy,” said M. Fortunat. “I like to see money\ngained by those who make a good use of it. And to prove this, I’m\nabout to employ you in an affair which will pay you handsomely if you\nprosecute it successfully.”\n\nChupin’s eyes brightened at first but grew dark a moment afterward, for\ndelight had been quickly followed by a feeling of distrust. He thought\nit exceedingly strange that an employer should take the trouble to climb\nto a sixth floor merely for the purpose of conferring a favor on his\nclerk. There must be something behind all this; and so it behove him to\nkeep his eyes open. However, he knew how to conceal his real feelings;\nand it was with a joyous air that he exclaimed: “Eh! What? Money? Now?\nWhat must I do to earn it?”\n\n“Oh! a mere trifle,” replied the agent; “almost nothing, indeed.” And\ndrawing his chair nearer to the bed on which his employee was seated,\nhe added: “But first, one question, Victor. By the way in which a woman\nlooks at a young man in the street, at the theatre or anywhere--would\nyou know if she were watching her son?”\n\nChupin shrugged his shoulders. “What a question!” he retorted.\n“Nonsense! monsieur, it would be impossible to deceive me. I should only\nhave to remember my mother’s eyes when I return home in the evening.\nPoor woman! although she’s half blind, she sees me--and if you wish\nto make her happy, you’ve only to tell her I’m the handsomest and most\namiable youth in Paris.”\n\nM. Fortunat could not refrain from rubbing his hands, so delighted was\nhe to see his idea so perfectly understood and so admirably expressed.\n“Good!” he declared; “very good! That’s intelligence, if I am any judge.\nI have not been deceived in you, Victor.”\n\nVictor was on fire with curiosity. “What am I to do, monsieur?” he asked\neagerly.\n\n“This: you must follow a woman whom I shall point out to you, follow her\neverywhere without once losing sight of her, and so skilfully as not to\nlet her suspect it. You must watch her every glance, and when her eyes\ntell you that she is looking at her son, your task will be nearly over.\nYou will then only have to follow this son, and find out his name and\naddress, what he does, and how he lives. I don’t know if I explain what\nI mean very clearly.”\n\nThis doubt was awakened in M. Fortunat’s mind by Chupin’s features,\nwhich were expressive of lively astonishment and discontent. “Excuse me,\nmonsieur,” he said, at last, “I do not understand at all.”\n\n“It’s very simple, however. The lady in question has a son about twenty.\nI know it--I’m sure of it. But she denies it; she conceals the fact, and\nhe doesn’t even know her. She secretly watches over him, however--she\nprovides him with money, and every day she finds some way of seeing him.\nNow, it is to my interest to find this son.”\n\nChupin’s mobile face became actually threatening in its expression; he\nfrowned darkly, and his lips quivered. Still this did not prevent M.\nFortunat from adding, with the assurance of a man who does not even\nsuspect the possibility of a refusal: “Now, when shall we set about our\ntask?”\n\n“Never!” cried Chupin, violently; and, rising, he continued: “No! I\nwouldn’t let my good mother eat bread earned in that way--it would\nstrangle her! Turn spy! I? Thanks--some one else may have the job!” He\nhad become as red as a turkey-cock, and such was his indignation that he\nforgot his accustomed reserve and the caution with which he had so far\nconcealed his antecedents. “I know this game--I’ve tried it!” he went\non, vehemently. “One might as well take one’s ticket to prison by a\ndirect road. I should be there now if it hadn’t been for Monsieur Andre.\nI was thirsting for gold, and, like the brigand that I was, I should\nhave killed the man; but in revenge he drew me from the mire and placed\nmy feet on solid ground once more. And now, shall I go back to my vile\ntricks again? Why, I’d rather cut my leg off! I’m to hunt down this poor\nwoman--I’m to discover her secret so that you may extort money from her,\nam I? No, not I! I should like to be rich, and I shall be rich; but I’ll\nmake my money honestly. I hope to touch my hundred-franc pieces without\nbeing obliged to wash my hands afterward. So, a very good evening to\nyour establishment.”\n\nM. Fortunat was amazed, and at the same time much annoyed, to find\nhimself forsaken on account of such a trifle. He feared, too, that\nChupin might let his tongue wag if he left his employment. So, since he\nhad confided this project to Chupin, he was determined that Chupin alone\nshould carry it into execution. Assuming his most severe and injured\nmanner, he sternly exclaimed: “I think you have lost your senses.”\n His demeanor and intonation were so perfectly cool that Chupin seemed\nslightly abashed. “It seems that you think me capable of urging you to\ncommit some dangerous and dishonorable act,” continued M. Fortunat.\n\n“Why--no--m’sieur--I assure you.”\n\nThere was such evident hesitation in the utterance of this “no” that the\nagent at once resumed: “Come, you are not ignorant of the fact that\nin addition to my business as a collector, I give my attention to the\ndiscovery of the heirs of unclaimed estates? You are aware of this?\nVery well then: pray tell me how I am to find them without searching for\nthem? If I wish this lady to be watched, it is only in view of reaching\na poor lad who is likely to be defrauded of the wealth that rightfully\nbelongs to him. And when I give you a chance to make forty or fifty\nfrancs in a couple of days, you receive my proposition in this style!\nYou are an ingrate and a fool, Victor!”\n\nChupin’s nature combined, in a remarkable degree, the vices and\npeculiarities of the dweller in the Paris faubourgs, who is born old,\nbut who, when aged in years, still remains a gamin. In his youth he had\nseen many strange things, and acquired a knowledge of life that would\nhave put the experience of a philosopher to shame. But he was not fit to\ncope with M. Fortunat, who had an immense advantage over him, by reason\nof his position of employer, as well as by his fortune and education.\nSo Chupin was both bewildered and disconcerted by the cool arguments his\npatron brought forward; and what most effectually allayed his suspicions\nwas the small compensation offered for the work--merely forty or fifty\nfrancs. “Small potatoes, upon my word!” he thought. “Just the price of\nan honest service; he would have offered more for a piece of rascality.”\n So, after considering a moment, he said, aloud: “Very well; I’m your\nman, m’sieur.”\n\nM. Fortunat was secretly laughing at the success of his ruse. Having\ncome with the intention of offering his agent a handsome sum, he was\nagreeably surprised to find that Chupin’s scruples would enable him to\nsave his money. “If I hadn’t found you engaged in study, Victor,” he\nsaid, “I should have thought you had been drinking. What venomous insect\nstung you so suddenly? Haven’t I confided similar undertakings to you\ntwenty times since you have been in my employment? Who ransacked Paris\nto find certain debtors who were concealing themselves? Who discovered\nthe Vantrassons for me? Victor Chupin. Very well. Then allow me to say\nthat I see nothing in this case in any way differing from the others,\nnor can I understand why this should be wrong, if the others were not.”\n\nChupin could only have answered this remark by saying that there had\nbeen no mystery about the previous affairs, that they had not been\nproposed to him late at night at his own home, and that he had acted\nopenly, as a person who represents a creditor has a recognized right\nto act. But, though he felt that there WAS a difference in the present\ncase, it would have been very difficult for him to explain in what this\ndifference consisted. Hence, in his most resolute tone: “I’m only a\nfool, m’sieur,” he declared; “but I shall know how to make amends for my\nfolly.”\n\n“That means you have recovered your senses,” said M. Fortunat,\nironically. “Really, that’s fortunate. But let me give you one bit\nof advice: watch yourself, and learn to bridle your tongue. You won’t\nalways find me in such a good humor as I am this evening.”\n\nSo saying, he rose, passed out into the adjoining room, bowed civilly\nto his clerk’s mother, and went off. His last words, as he crossed the\nthreshold, were, “So I shall rely upon you. Be at the office to-morrow a\nlittle before noon.”\n\n“It’s agreed m’sieur.”\n\nThe blind woman had risen, and had bowed respectfully; but, as soon as\nshe was alone with her son, she asked: “What is this business he bids\nyou undertake in such a high and mighty tone?”\n\n“Oh! an every-day matter, mother.”\n\nThe old woman shook her head. “Why were you talking so loud then?” she\ninquired. “Weren’t you quarrelling? It must be something very grave when\nit’s necessary to conceal it from me. I couldn’t see your employer’s\nface, my son; but I heard his voice, and it didn’t please me. It isn’t\nthe voice of an honest, straightforward man. Take care, Toto, and don’t\nallow yourself to be cajoled--be prudent.”\n\nHowever, it was quite unnecessary to recommend prudence to Victor\nChupin. He had promised his assistance, but not without a mental\nreservation. “No need to see danger till it comes,” he had said to\nhimself. “If the thing proves to be of questionable propriety after all,\nthen good-evening; I desert.”\n\nIt remains to know what he meant by questionable propriety; the meaning\nof the expression is rather vague. He had returned in all honesty and\nsincerity of purpose to an honest life, and nothing in the world would\nhave induced him, avaricious though he was, to commit an act that was\npositively wrong. Only the line that separates good from evil was not\nvery clearly defined in his mind. This was due in a great measure to his\neducation, and to the fact that it had been long before he realized that\npolice regulations do not constitute the highest moral law. It was due\nalso to chance, and, since he had no decided calling, to the necessity\nof depending for a livelihood upon the many strange professions which\nimpecunious and untrained individuals, both of the higher and lower\nclasses, adopt in Paris.\n\nHowever, on the following morning he arrayed himself in his best\napparel, and at exactly half-past eleven o’clock he rang at his\nemployer’s door. M. Fortunat had made quick work with his clients that\nmorning, and was ready, dressed to go out. He took up his hat and said\nonly the one word, “Come.” The place where the agent conducted his\nclerk was the wine-shop in the Rue de Berry, where he had made inquiries\nrespecting Madame d’Argeles the evening before; and on arriving there,\nhe generously offered him a breakfast. Before entering, however, he\npointed out Madame d’Argeles’s pretty house on the opposite side of the\nstreet, and said to him: “The woman whom you are to follow, and whose\nson you are to discover, will emerge from that house.”\n\nAt that moment, after a night passed in meditating upon his mother’s\nprophetic warnings, Chupin was again beset by the same scruples which\nhad so greatly disturbed him on the previous evening. However, they\nsoon vanished when he heard the wine-vendor, in reply to M. Fortunat’s\nskilful questions, begin to relate all he knew concerning Madame Lia\nd’Argeles, and the scandalous doings at her house. The seeker after lost\nheirs and his clerk were served at a little table near the door;\nand while they partook of the classical beef-steak and; potatoes--M.\nFortunat eating daintily, and Chupin bolting his food with the appetite\nof a ship-wrecked mariner--they watched the house opposite.\n\nMadame d’Argeles received on Saturdays, and, as Chupin remarked, “there\nwas a regular procession of visitors.”\n\nStanding beside M. Fortunat, and flattered by the attention which such\na well-dressed gentleman paid to his chatter, the landlord of the house\nmentioned the names of all the visitors he knew. And he knew a good\nnumber of them, for the coachmen came to his shop for refreshments when\ntheir masters were spending the night in play at Madame d’Argeles’s\nhouse. So he was able to name the Viscount de Coralth, who dashed up to\nthe door in a two-horse phaeton, as well as Baron Trigault, who came on\nfoot, for exercise, puffing and blowing like a seal. The wine-vendor,\nmoreover, told his customers that Madame d’Argeles never went out before\nhalf-past two or three o’clock, and then always in a carriage--a piece\nof information which must have troubled Chupin; for, as soon as the\nlandlord had left them to serve some other customers, he leant forward\nand said to M. Fortunat: “Did you hear that? How is it possible to track\na person who’s in a carriage?”\n\n“By following in another vehicle, of course.”\n\n“Certainly, m’sieur; that’s as clear as daylight. But that isn’t the\nquestion. The point is this: How can one watch the face of a person who\nturns her back to you? I must see this woman’s face to know whom she\nlooks at, and how.”\n\nThis objection, grave as it appeared, did not seem to disturb M.\nFortunat. “Don’t worry about that, Victor,” he replied. “Under such\ncircumstances, a mother wouldn’t try to see her son from a rapidly\nmoving carriage. She will undoubtedly alight, and contrive some means of\npassing and repassing him--of touching him, if possible. Your task will\nonly consist in following her closely enough to be on the ground as soon\nas she is. Confine your efforts to that; and if you fail to-day,\nyou’ll succeed to-morrow or the day after--the essential thing is to be\npatient.”\n\nHe did better than to preach patience--he practised it. The hours wore\naway, and yet he did not stir from his post, though nothing could have\nbeen more disagreeable to him than to remain on exhibition, as it were,\nat the door of a wine-shop. At last, at a little before three o’clock,\nthe gates over the way turned upon their hinges, and a dark-blue\nvictoria, in which a woman was seated, rolled forth into the street.\n“Look!” said M. Fortunat, eagerly. “There she is!”\n\n\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n\nThe woman in the carriage was none other than Madame Lia d’Argeles.\nShe was attired in one of those startling costumes which are the rage\nnowadays, and which impart the same bold and brazen appearance to all\nwho wear them: so much so, that the most experienced observers are\nno longer able to distinguish the honest mother of a family from a\nnotorious character. A Dutchman, named Van Klopen, who was originally a\ntailor at Rotterdam, rightfully ascribes the honor of this progress to\nhimself. One can scarcely explain how it happens that this individual,\nwho calls himself “the dressmaker of the queens of Europe,” has become\nthe arbiter of Parisian elegance; but it is an undeniable fact that\nhe does reign over fashion. He decrees the colors that shall be worn,\ndecides whether dresses shall be short or long, whether paniers shall\nbe adopted or discarded, whether ruches and puffs and flowers shall be\nallowed, and in what form; and his subjects, the so-called elegant women\nof Paris, obey him implicitly.\n\nMadame d’Argeles would personally have preferred less finery, perhaps,\nbut it would not have done for her to be out of the fashion. She wore an\nimperceptible hat, balanced on an immense pyramidal chignon, from which\nescaped a torrent of wavy hair. “What a beautiful woman!” exclaimed the\ndazzled Chupin, and indeed, seen from this distance, she did not look a\nday more than thirty-five--an age when beauty possesses all the alluring\ncharm of the luscious fruit of autumn. She was giving orders for the\ndrive, and her coachman, with a rose in his buttonhole, listened while\nhe reined in the spirited horse. “The weather’s superb,” added Chupin.\n“She’ll no doubt drive round the lakes in the Bois de Boulogne----”\n\n“Ah, she’s off!” interrupted M. Fortunat. “Run, Victor, run! and\ndon’t be miserly as regards carriage hire; all your expenses shall be\nliberally refunded you.”\n\nChupin was already far away. Madame d’Argeles’s horse went swiftly\nenough, but the agent’s emissary had the limbs and the endurance of a\nstag, and he kept pace with the victoria without much difficulty. And\nas he ran along, his brain was busy. “If I don’t take a cab,” he said to\nhimself, “if I follow the woman on foot, I shall have a perfect right to\npocket the forty-five sous an hour--fifty, counting the gratuity--that a\ncab would cost.”\n\nBut on reaching the Champ Elysees, he discovered, to his regret,\nthat this plan was impracticable, for on running down the Avenue de\nl’Imperatrice after the rapidly driven carriage, he could not fail to\nattract attention. Stifling a sigh of regret, and seeing a cab at a\nstand near by, he hastily hailed it. “Where do you want to go, sir?”\n inquired the driver.\n\n“Just follow that blue victoria, in which a handsome lady is seated, my\ngood fellow.”\n\nThe order did not surprise the cabman, but rather the person who gave\nit; for in spite of his fine apparel, Chupin did not seem quite the\nman for such an adventure. “Excuse me,” said the Jehu, in a slightly\nironical tone, “I----”\n\n“I said exactly what I mean,” retorted Chupin, whose pride was severely\nwounded. “And no more talk--hurry on, or we shall miss the track.”\n\nThis last remark was correct, for if Madame d’Argeles’s coachman had not\nslackened his horse’s speed on passing round the Arc de Triomphe, the\nwoman would have escaped Chupin, for that day at least. However, this\ncircumstance gave the cabman an opportunity to overtake the victoria;\nand after that the two vehicles kept close together as they proceeded\ndown the Avenue de l’Imperatrice. But at the entrance of the Bois de\nBoulogne Chupin ordered his driver to stop. “Halt!” he exclaimed; “I\nshall get out. Pay the extra cab charges for passing beyond the limits\nof Paris!--never! I’ll crawl on my hands and knees first. Here are forty\nsous for your fare--and good-evening to you.”\n\nAnd, as the blue victoria was already some distance in advance, he\nstarted off at the top of his speed to overtake it. This manoeuvre was\nthe result of his meditations while riding along. “What will this fine\nlady do when she gets to the Bois?” he asked himself. “Why, her coachman\nwill take his place in the procession, and drive her slowly round and\nround the lakes. Meantime I can trot along beside her without attracting\nattention--and it will be good for my health.”\n\nHis expectations were realized in every respect. The victoria soon\nturned to the left, and took its place in the long line of equipages\nwhich were slowly winding round the lake. Having gained the foot-path\nwhich borders the sheet of water, Chupin followed the carriage easily\nenough, with his hands in his pockets, and his heart jubilant at the\nthought that he would gain the sum supposed to have been spent in cab\nhire, in addition to the compensation which had been promised him. “This\nis a strange way of enjoying one’s self,” he muttered, as he trotted\nalong. “There can’t be much pleasure in going round and round this lake.\nIf ever I’m rich, I’ll find some other way of amusing myself.”\n\nPoor Chupin did not know that people do not go to the Bois to enjoy\nthemselves, but rather to torment others. This broad drive is in reality\nonly a field for the airing of vanity--a sort of open-air bazaar for\nthe display of dresses and equipages. People come here to see and to\nbe seen; and, moreover, this is neutral ground, where so-called honest\nwomen can meet those notorious characters from whom they are elsewhere\nseparated by an impassable abyss. What exquisite pleasure it must be to\nthe dames of society to find themselves beside Jenny Fancy or Ninette\nSimplon, or any other of those young ladies whom they habitually\ncall “creatures,” but whom they are continually talking of, and whose\ntoilettes, make-up, and jargon, they assiduously copy!\n\nHowever, Chupin indulged in none of these reflections. He was engaged in\nnoting Madame d’Argeles’s evident anxiety and restlessness. She looked\neagerly on all sides, sometimes half leaning out of her carriage, and\nimmediately turning her head whenever she heard the gallop of a horseman\nbehind her. She was evidently looking or waiting for some one, but the\nperson did not make his appearance, and so, growing weary of waiting,\nafter driving three times round the lake, she made a sign to her\ncoachman, who at once drew out of line, and turned his horse into a\nside-path. Chupin hastened after the victoria, keeping it in sight until\nhe was fortunate enough to meet an empty cab, which he at once hired.\nMadame d’Argeles’s coachman, who had received his orders, now drove down\nthe Champs Elysees, again crossed the Place de la Concorde, turned into\nthe boulevards, and stopped short at the corner of the Chaussee d’Antin,\nwhere, having tied a thick veil over her face, Madame Lia abruptly\nalighted and walked away.\n\nThis was done so quickly that Chupin barely had time to fling two francs\nto his driver and rush after her. She had already turned round the\ncorner of the Rue du Helder, and was walking rapidly up the street.\nIt was a little after five o’clock, and dusk was setting in. Madame\nd’Argeles had taken the side of the street allotted to the uneven\nnumbers. After she had passed the Hotel de Homburg, she slackened her\npace, and eagerly scrutinized one of the houses opposite--No. 48. Her\nexamination lasted but a moment, and seemed to be satisfactory. She then\nturned, and rapidly retraced her steps as far as the boulevard, when,\ncrossing the street to the side of the even numbers, she walked up it\nagain very slowly, stopping before every shop-window.\n\nConvinced that he had almost reached the goal, Chupin also crossed,\nand followed closely at her heels. He soon saw her start and resume her\nrapid gait. A young man was coming toward her so quickly indeed that she\nhad not time to avoid him, and a collision ensued, whereupon the young\nman gave vent to an oath, and hurling an opprobrious epithet in her\nface, passed on.\n\nChupin shuddered. “What if that should be her son?” he thought. And\nwhile he pretended to be gazing into a shop window, he stealthily\nwatched the poor woman. She had paused, and he was so near that he\ncould almost have touched her. He saw her raise her veil and follow her\ninsulter with a look which it was impossible to misunderstand. “Oh! oh!\nIt was her son that called her that----” said Chupin to himself, quite\nhorrified. And without more ado, he hastened after the young man.\n\nHe was between two and four-and-twenty years of age, rather above the\nmedium height, with very light hair and an extremely pale complexion.\nHis slight mustache would have been almost imperceptible if it had not\nbeen dyed several shades darker than his hair. He was attired with that\nstudied carelessness which many consider to be the height of elegance,\nbut which is just the reverse. And his bearing, his mustache, and\nhis low hat, tipped rakishly over one ear, gave him an arrogant,\npretentious, rowdyish appearance. “Zounds! that fellow doesn’t suit my\nfancy,” growled Chupin, as he trotted along. For he was almost running\nin his efforts to keep pace with Madame d’Argeles’s insulter. The\nlatter’s haste was soon explained. He was carrying a letter which he\nwished to have delivered, and no doubt he feared he would not be able\nto find a commissionaire. Having discovered one at last, he called him,\ngave him the missive, and then pursued his way more leisurely.\n\nHe had reached the boulevard, when a florid-faced youth, remarkably\nshort and stout, rushed toward him with both hands amicably extended,\nat the same time crying, loud enough to attract the attention of the\npassers-by: “Is it possible that this is my dear Wilkie?”\n\n“Yes--alive and in the flesh,” replied the young man.\n\n“Well, and what the devil have you been doing with yourself? Last\nSunday, at the races, I looked for you everywhere, and not a vestige\nof Wilkie was to be found. However, you were wise not to go. I am three\nhundred louis out of pocket. I staked everything on Domingo, the Marquis\nde Valorsay’s horse. I thought I was sure to win--yes, sure. Well,\nDomingo came in third. Can you understand that? If every one didn’t know\nthat Valorsay was a millionaire, it might be supposed there had been\nsome foul play--yes, upon my word--that he had bet against his own\nhorse, and forbidden his jockey to win the race.” But the speaker did\nnot really believe this, so he continued, more gayly: “Fortunately,\nI shall retrieve my losses to-morrow, at Vincennes. Shall we see you\nthere?”\n\n“Probably.”\n\n“Then good-by, until to-morrow.”\n\n“Until to-morrow.”\n\nThereupon they shook hands, and each departed on his way.\n\nChupin had not lost a word of this conversation. “Valorsay a\nmillionaire!” he said to himself. “That’s good! Ah, well! now I know\nmy little gamecock’s name, and I also know that he goes to the races.\nWilkie that must be an English name; I like the name of d’Argeles\nbetter. But where the devil is he going now?”\n\nM. Wilkie had simply paused to replenish his cigar-case at the tobacco\noffice of the Grand Hotel; and, after lighting a cigar, he came out\nagain, and walked up the boulevard in the direction of the Faubourg\nMontmartre. He was no longer in a hurry now; he strolled along in view\nof killing time, displaying his charms, and staring impudently at every\nwoman who passed. With his shoulders drawn up on a level with his ears,\nand his chest thrown back, he dragged his feet after him as if his\nlimbs were half paralyzed; he was indeed doing his best to create the\nimpression that he was used up, exhausted, broken down by excesses and\ndissipation. For that is the fashion--the latest fancy--chic!\n\n“Will you never have done?” growled Chupin.\n\n“You shall pay for this, you little wretch!” He was so indignant that\nthe gamin element in his nature stirred again under his fine broadcloth,\nand he had a wild longing to throw stones at M. Wilkie. He would\ncertainly have trodden on his heels, and have picked a quarrel with him,\nhad it not been for a fear of failing in his mission, and thereby losing\nhis promised reward.\n\nHe followed his man closely, for the crowd was very great. Light was\ncoming on, and the gas was lit on all sides. The weather was very mild,\nand there was not an unoccupied table in front of the cafes, for it was\nnow the absinthe hour. How does it happen that every evening, between\nfive and seven o’clock, every one in Paris who is known--who is somebody\nor something--can be found between the Passage de l’Opera and the\nPassage Jouffroy? Hereabout you may hear all the latest news and gossip\nof the fashionable world, the last political canards--all the incidents\nof Parisian life which will be recorded by the papers on the following\nmorning. You may learn the price of stocks, and obtain tips for\nto-morrow’s Bourse; ascertain how much Mademoiselle A’s necklace cost,\nand who gave it to her; with the latest news from Prussia; and the name\nof the bank chairman or cashier who has absconded during the day, and\nthe amount he has taken with him.\n\nThe crowd became more dense as the Faubourg Montmartre was approached,\nbut Wilkie made his way through the throng with the ease of an old\nboulevardier. He must have had a large circle of acquaintances, for\nhe distributed bows right and left, and was spoken to by five or six\npromenaders. He did not pass the Terrasse Jouffroy, but, pausing there,\nhe purchased an evening paper, retraced his steps, and about seven\no’clock reached the Cafe Riche, which he entered triumphantly. He did\nnot even touch the rim of his hat on going in--that would have been\nexcessively BAD form; but he called a waiter, in a very loud voice,\nand imperiously ordered him to serve dinner on a table near the window,\nwhere he could see the boulevard--and be seen.\n\n“And now my little fighting-cock is going to feed,” thought Chupin. He,\ntoo, was hungry; and he was trying to think of some modest restaurant\nin the neighborhood, when two young men passed near him and glanced into\nthe cafe.\n\n“Look, there’s Wilkie!” observed one of them.\n\n“That’s so, upon my word!” responded the other. “And he has money, too;\nfortune has smiled upon him.”\n\n“How do you know that?”\n\n“Why, by watching the fellow; one can tell the condition of his purse\nas correctly as he could himself. If his funds are low, he has his meals\nbrought to his room from a cook-shop where he has credit; his mustache\ndroops despondingly; he is humble even to servility with his friends,\nand he brushes his hair over his forehead. When he is in average\ncircumstances, he dines at Launay’s, waxes his mustache, and brushes his\nhair back from his face. But when he dines at the Cafe Riche, my boy,\nwhen he has dyed his mustache, and tips his hat over his ear, and\ndeports himself in that arrogant fashion, why, he has at least five or\nsix thousand francs in his pocket, and all is well with him.”\n\n“Where does he get his money from?”\n\n“Who can tell?”\n\n“Is he rich?”\n\n“He must have plenty of money--I lent him ten louis once, and he paid me\nback.”\n\n“Zounds! He’s a very honorable fellow, then.” Thereupon the two young\nmen laughed, and passed on.\n\nChupin had been greatly edified. “Now I know you as well as if I were\nyour concierge,” he muttered, addressing the unconscious Wilkie; “and\nwhen I’ve followed you home, and learned your number, I shall have\nrichly earned the fifty francs M. Fortunat promised me.” As well as he\ncould judge through the windowpane, M. Wilkie was eating his dinner\nwith an excellent appetite. “Ah!” he exclaimed, not without envy, “these\nfighting-cocks take good care of their stomachs. He’s there for an hour\nat least, and I shall have time to run and swallow a mouthful myself.”\n\nSo saying, Chupin hastened to a small restaurant in a neighboring\nstreet, and magnificently disbursed the sum of thirty-nine sous. Such\nextravagance was unusual on his part, for he had lived very frugally\nsince he had taken a vow to become rich. Formerly, when he lived from\nhand to mouth--to use his own expression--he indulged in cigars and in\nabsinthe; but now he contented himself with the fare of an anchorite,\ndrank nothing but water, and only smoked when some one gave him a cigar.\nNor was this any great privation to him, since he gained a penny by\nit--and a penny was another grain of sand added to the foundation of his\nfuture wealth. However, this evening he indulged in the extravagance of\na glass of wine, deciding in his own mind that he had fairly earned it.\n\nWhen he returned to his post in front of the Cafe Riche, M. Wilkie was\nno longer alone at his table. He was finishing his coffee in the company\nof a man of his own age, who was remarkably good-looking--almost too\ngood-looking, in fact--and a glance at whom caused Chupin to exclaim:\n“What! what! I’ve seen that face somewhere before--“. But he racked his\nbrain in vain in trying to remember who this newcomer was, in trying to\nset a name on this face, which was positively annoying in its classical\nbeauty, and which he felt convinced had occupied a place among the\nphantoms of his past. Irritated beyond endurance by what he termed his\nstupidity, he was trying to decide whether he should enter the cafe or\nnot, when he saw M. Wilkie take his bill from the hands of a waiter,\nglance at it, and throw a louis on the table. His companion had drawn\nout his pocketbook for the ostensible purpose of paying for the coffee\nhe had taken; but Wilkie, with a cordial gesture, forbade it, and\nmade that magnificent, imperious sign to the waiter, which so clearly\nimplies: “Take nothing! All is paid! Keep the change.” Thereupon the\nservant gravely retired, more than ever convinced of the fact that\nvanity increases the fabulous total of Parisian gratuities by more than\na million francs a year.\n\n“My gallant youths are coming out,” thought Chupin. “I must keep my ears\nopen.” And approaching the door, he dropped on one knee, and pretended\nto be engaged in tying his shoestrings. This is one of the thousand\nexpedients adopted by spies and inquisitive people. And when a man is\nfoolish enough to tell his secrets in the street, he should at least be\nwise enough to distrust the people near him who pretend to be absorbed\nin something else; for in nine cases out of ten these persons are\nlistening to him, possibly for pay, or possibly from curiosity.\n\nHowever, the young men whom Chupin was watching were far from suspecting\nthat they were under surveillance. M. Wilkie came out first, talking\nvery loud, as often happens when a man has just partaken of a good\ndinner, and is blessed with an excellent digestion. “Come, Coralth,\nmy good fellow, you won’t desert me in this way? I have a box for the\nVarietes, and you must go with me. We’ll see if Silly imitates Theresa\nas perfectly as they say.”\n\n“But I have an appointment.”\n\n“Oh, well, let it wait. Come, viscount, is it agreed?”\n\n“Ah, you do with me just as you like.”\n\n“Good! But, first of all let us take a glass of beer to finish our\ncigars. And do you know whom you will find in my box?”\n\nAt this moment they passed, and Chupin rose to his feet. “Coralth,” he\nmuttered, “Viscount de Coralth. He’s not one of our clients. Let me see,\nCoralth. This is certainly the first time I have ever heard the name.\nCan it be that I’m mistaken? Impossible!”\n\nThe more he reflected, the more thoroughly he became convinced of the\naccuracy of his first impression, consoling himself with the thought\nthat a name has but a slight significance after all. His preoccupation\nhad at least the advantage of shortening the time which he spent in\npromenading to and fro, while the friends sat outside a cafe smoking and\ndrinking. It was still M. Wilkie who monopolized the conversation, while\nhis companion listened with his elbow resting on the table, occasionally\nnodding his head in token of approbation. One thing that incensed Chupin\nwas that they loitered there, when one of them had a ticket for a box at\nthe theatre in his pocket.\n\n“Idiots!” he growled; “they’ll wait till the play’s half over before\nthey go in. And then they’ll let the doors slam behind them for the\nexpress purpose of disturbing everybody. Fools, go!”\n\nAs if they had heard the command, they rose suddenly, and an instant\nafter they entered the Varietes. They entered, but Chupin remained on\nthe pavement, scratching his head furiously, in accordance with his\nhabit whenever he wished to develop his powers of imagination. He was\ntrying to think how he might procure admission to the theatre without\npaying for it. For several years he had seen every play put upon the\nstage in Paris, without spending a sou, and he felt that it would be\nactually degrading to purchase a ticket at the office now. “Pay to see a\nfarce!” he thought. “Not I. I must know some one here--I’ll wait for the\nentr’acte.”\n\nThe wisdom of this course became apparent when among those who left the\ntheatre at the close of the first act he recognized an old acquaintance,\nwho was now working on the claque, [3] and who at once procured him\na ticket of admission for nothing. “Well, it is a good thing to have\nfriends everywhere,” he muttered, as he took the seat assigned him.\n\nIt was a very good place they had given him--a seat in the second\ngallery commanding an excellent view of the house. The first glance\naround told him that his “customers,” as he styled them, were in a\nbox exactly opposite. They were now in the company of two damsels in\nstartling toilettes, with exceedingly dishevelled yellow hair, who moved\nrestlessly about, and giggled and stared, and tried in every possible\nway to attract attention. And their stratagem succeeded. However, this\ndid not seem to please the Viscount de Coralth, who kept himself as far\nback in the shade as he possibly could. But young Wilkie was evidently\ndelighted, and seemed manifestly proud of the attention which the public\nwas compelled to bestow upon his box. He offered himself as much as\npossible to the gaze of the audience; moved about, leaned forward, and\nmade himself fully as conspicuous as his fair companions. Less than ever\ndid Chupin now forgive Wilkie for the insult he had cast in the face of\nMadame Lia d’Argeles, who was probably his mother.\n\nAs for the play, M. Fortunat’s emissary did not hear twenty words of it.\nHe was so overcome with fatigue that he soon fell asleep. The noise and\nbustle of each entr’acte aroused him a little, but he did not thoroughly\nwake up until the close of the performance. His “customers” were still\nin their box, and M. Wilkie was gallantly wrapping the ladies in their\ncloaks and shawls. In the vestibule, he and M. de Coralth were joined by\nseveral other young men, and the whole party adjourned to a neighboring\ncafe. “These people are certainly afflicted with an unquenchable\nthirst,” growled Chupin. “I wonder if this is their everyday life?”\n\nHe, too, was thirsty after his hastily eaten dinner; and necessity\nprevailing over economy, he seated himself at a table outside the cafe,\nand called for a glass of beer, in which he moistened his parched lips\nwith a sigh of intense satisfaction. He sipped the beverage slowly, in\norder to make it last the longer, but this did not prevent his glass\nfrom becoming dry long before M. Wilkie and his friends were ready to\nleave. “It seems to me we are going to stay here all night,” he thought,\nangrily.\n\nHis ill-humor was not strange under the circumstances, for it was one\no’clock in the morning; and after carrying all the tables and chairs\nround about, inside, a waiter came to ask Chupin to go away. All the\nother cafes were closing too, and the fastening of bolts or the clanking\nof shutter chains could be heard on every side. On the pavement stood\ngroups of waiters in their shirt-sleeves, stretching and yawning,\nand inhaling the fresh night air with delight. The boulevard was fast\nbecoming deserted--the men were going off in little groups, and female\nforms could be seen gliding along in the dark shadow cast by the houses.\nThe police were watching everywhere, with a word of menace ever ready\non their lips; and soon the only means of egress from the cafes were\nthe narrow, low doorways cut in the shutters through which the last\ncustomers--the insatiable, who are always ordering one thimbleful more\nto finish--passed out.\n\nIt was through a portal of this sort that M. Wilkie and his companions\nat last emerged, and on perceiving them, Chupin gave a grunt of\nsatisfaction. “At last,” he thought, “I can follow the man to his door,\ntake his number, and go home.”\n\nBut his joy was short-lived, for M. Wilkie proposed that the whole party\nshould go and take supper. M. de Coralth demurred to the idea, but the\nothers over-ruled his objections, and dragged him away with them.\n\n\n\n\nXIX.\n\n\n“Ah! this is a bad job!” growled Chupin. “Go, go, and never stop!”\n\nWhat exasperated him even more than his want of sleep was the thought\nthat his good mother must be waiting for him at home in an agony of\nanxiety; for since his reformation he had become remarkably regular in\nhis habits. What should he do? “Go home,” said Reason; “it will be easy\nenough to find this Wilkie again. There can be little doubt that he\nlives at No. 48, in the Rue du Helder.” “Remain,” whispered Avarice;\n“and, since you have accomplished so much, finish your work. M. Fortunat\nwon’t pay for conjectures, but for a certainty.”\n\nLove of money carried the day; so, weaving an interminable chaplet of\noaths, he followed the party until they entered Brebant’s restaurant,\none of the best known establishments which remain open at night-time. It\nwas nearly two o’clock in the morning now; the boulevard was silent and\ndeserted, and yet this restaurant was brilliantly lighted from top to\nbottom, and snatches of song and shouts of laughter, with the clatter\nof knives and forks and the clink of glasses, could be heard through the\nhalf opened windows.\n\n“Eight dozen Marennes for No. 6,” shouted a waiter to the man who opened\noysters near the restaurant door.\n\nOn hearing this order, Chupin shook his clenched fist at the stars. “The\nwretches!” he muttered through his set teeth; “bad luck to them! Those\noysters are for their mouths, plainly enough, for there are eight of\nthem in all, counting those yellow-haired women. They will, no doubt,\nremain at table until six o’clock in the morning. And they call this\nenjoying themselves. And meanwhile, poor little Chupin must wear out his\nshoe-leather on the pavement. Ah! they shall pay for this!”\n\nIt ought to have been some consolation to him to see that he was not\nalone in his misery, for in front of the restaurant stood a dozen cabs\nwith sleepy drivers, who were waiting for chance to send them one of\nthose half-intoxicated passengers who refuse to pay more than fifteen\nsous for their fare, but give their Jehu a gratuity of a louis. All\nthese vehicles belonged to the peculiar category known as “night\ncabs”--dilapidated conveyances with soiled, ragged linings, and drawn by\nhalf-starved, jaded horses.\n\nHowever, Chupin neither thought of these vehicles, nor of the poor\nhorses, nor, indeed, of the drivers themselves. His wrath had been\nsucceeded by philosophical resignation; he accepted with good grace what\nhe could not avoid. As the night air had become very cool, he turned up\nthe collar of his overcoat, and began to pace to and fro on the pavement\nin front of the restaurant. He had made a hundred turns perhaps, passing\nthe events of the day in review, when suddenly such a strange and\nstartling idea flashed across his mind that he stood motionless, lost\nin astonishment. Reflecting on the manner in which M. Wilkie and the\nViscount de Coralth had behaved during the evening, a singular suspicion\nassailed him. While M. Wilkie gradually lost his wits, M. de Coralth\nhad become remarkably cold and reserved. He had seemed to oppose all M.\nWilkie’s propositions; but he had agreed to them at last, so that his\nobjections had produced much the same effect as a stimulant. It seemed\nthen as if M. de Coralth had some strange interest in wishing to gain\nascendency over his friend. At least such was Chupin’s opinion. “Oh,\noh!” he murmured. “What if HE should be working up the same little\nscheme? What if he were acquainted with Madame Lia d’Argeles? What if he\nknew that there’s a fortune waiting for a claimant? I shouldn’t at all\nbe surprised if I found that he wanted to cook his bread in our oven.\nBut father Fortunat wouldn’t be pleased with the news. Ah! no--he\nwouldn’t even smile----”\n\nWhile carrying on this little conversation with himself, he stood just\nin front of the restaurant, looking up into the air, when all of a\nsudden a window was thrown noisily open, and the figures of two men\nbecame plainly visible. They were engaged in a friendly struggle; one of\nthem seemed to be trying to seize hold of something which the other had\nin his hand, and which he refused to part with. One of these men was M.\nWilkie as Chupin at once perceived. “Good!” he said to himself; “this is\nthe beginning of the end!”\n\nAs he spoke, M. Wilkie’s hat fell on the window-sill, slipped off, and\ndropped on to the pavement below. With a natural impulse Chupin picked\nit up, and he was turning it over and over in his hands, when M. Wilkie\nleant out of the window and shouted in a voice that was thick with wine:\n“Halloo! Eh, there! Who picked up my hat? Honesty shall be rewarded. A\nglass of champagne and a cigar for the fellow who’ll bring it me in room\nNo. 6.”\n\nChupin hesitated. By going up, he might, perhaps, compromise the success\nof his mission. But on the other hand his curiosity was aroused, and\nhe very much wished to see, with his own eyes, how these young men were\namusing themselves. Besides, he would have an opportunity of examining\nthis handsome viscount, whom he was certain he had met before, though he\ncould not tell when or where. In the meantime, M. Wilkie had perceived\nhim.\n\n“Come, you simpleton!” he cried; “make haste. You can’t be very\nthirsty.”\n\nThe thought of the viscount decided Chupin. Entering the restaurant\nand climbing the staircase, he had just reached the landing when a\npale-looking man, who had a smoothly-shaven face and was dressed in\nblack, barred his way and asked: “What do you want?”\n\n“M’sieur, here’s a hat which fell from one of your windows and----”\n\n“All right, hand it here.”\n\nBut Chupin did not seem to hear this order. He was beginning a long\nexplanation, when a curtain near by was pushed aside, and M. Wilkie\ncalled out: “Philippe! eh, Philippe!--bring me the man who picked up my\nhat.”\n\n“Ah!” said Chupin, “you see, m’sieur, that he asks for me.”\n\n“Very well,” said Philippe. “Go on, then.” And raising the portiere he\npushed Chupin into room No. 6.\n\nIt was a small, square apartment, with a very low ceiling. The\ntemperature was like that of a furnace, and the glare of the gaslights\nalmost blinded one. The supper was over, but the table had not yet been\ncleared, and plates full of leavings showed that the guests had fairly\nexhausted their appetites. Still, with the exception of M. Wilkie, every\none present seemed to be terribly bored. In one corner, with her head\nresting on a piano, sat one of the yellow-haired damsels, fast asleep,\nwhile, beside the window, M. de Coralth was smoking with his elbows\npropped upon the table. The four other young men were looking on\nphlegmatically. “Ah! here’s my hat,” exclaimed M. Wilkie, as soon as\nChupin appeared. “Wait and receive your promised reward.” And\nthereupon he rang the bell, crying at the top of his voice: “Henry,\nyou sleepy-head--a clean glass and some more of the widow Cliquot’s\nchampagne!”\n\nSeveral bottles were standing upon the table, only half empty, and\none of M. Wilkie’s friends called his attention to this fact, but he\nshrugged his shoulders disdainfully. “You must take me for a fool,” he\nsaid, contemptuously. “A man doesn’t drink stale wine when he has the\nprospect of such an inheritance as is coming to me.”\n\n“Wilkie!” interrupted M. de Coralth, quickly; “Wilkie!”\n\nBut he was too late; Chupin had heard and understood everything. His\nconjectures had proved correct. M. Wilkie knew his right to the estate;\nM. Fortunat had been forestalled by the viscount, and would merely\nhave his labor for his pains. “No chance for the guv’nor!” thought the\nagent’s emissary. “And what a blow after the De Valorsay affair! It’s\nenough to give him the jaundice!”\n\nFor a youth of his age, Chupin controlled his feelings admirably; but\nthe revelation came so suddenly that he had started despite himself, and\nchanged color a trifle. M. de Coralth saw this; and, though he was far\nfrom suspecting the truth, his long repressed anger burst forth. He rose\nabruptly, took up a bottle, and filling the nearest glass, he rudely\nexclaimed: “Come, drink that--make haste--and clear out!”\n\nVictor Chupin must have become very sensitive since his conversion. In\nformer times he was not wont to be so susceptible as to lose his temper\nwhen some one chanced to address him in a rather peremptory manner, or\nto offer him wine out of the first available glass. But M. de Coralth\ninspired him with one of those inexplicable aversions which cannot be\nrestrained “Eh! tell me if it’s because we’ve drank champagne together\nbefore that you talk to me like that?” the young fellow retorted,\nsavagely.\n\nIt was only a random shot, but it reached home. The viscount seemed\ntouched to the quick. “You hear that, Wilkie,” said he. “This will teach\nyou that the time of your compatriot, Lord Seymour, has passed by. The\ngood-humored race of plebeians who respectfully submitted to the blows\nwith which noblemen honored them after drinking, has died out. This\nought to cure you of your unfortunate habit of placing yourself on terms\nof equality with all the vagabonds you meet.”\n\nChupin’s hair fairly bristled with anger. “What! what!” he exclaimed;\n“I’ll teach you to call me a vagabond, you scoundrel!”\n\nHis gesture, his attitude, and his eyes were so expressive of defiance\nand menace that two of the guests sprang up and caught him by the arm.\n“Go, go,” they said.\n\nBut he freed himself from their grasp. “Go!” he replied. “Never! He\ncalled me a vagabond. Am I to pocket the insult quietly and walk off\nwith it? You can scarcely expect that. First, I demand an apology.”\n\nThis was asking too much of the Viscount de Coralth. “Let the fool\nalone,” he remarked, with affected coolness, “and ring for the waiters\nto kick him out.”\n\nIt did not require this new insult to put Chupin in a furious passion.\n“Come on!” he exclaimed. “Ah, ha! Where’s the fellow who’ll turn me out?\nLet him come. I’ll teach him a lesson!” And as he spoke he squared his\nshoulders, inflated his chest, and threw the weight of his entire body\non his left leg, after the most approved method of sparring-masters.\n\n“Go, go!” insisted Wilkie’s friends.\n\n“Yes, I’ll go with pleasure, but your friend must go, too. Is he a man?\nThen let him come, and we’ll settle this outside.” And seeing that they\nwere again trying to seize him: “Hands off!” he thundered, “or I’ll\nstrike. You were not obliged to invite me here. It isn’t my business to\nfurnish amusement to parties who’ve drunk too much wine. And why\nshould you despise me? It’s true I haven’t any money while you have\nplenty--that I work and you carouse. Still that’s no reason why\nyou should scorn me. Besides, those who are poor in the morning are\nsometimes rich in the evening. Every dog has his day. I have an idea\nthat I shall have some coin when yours is all gone. Then it will be\nmy turn to laugh; and as I’m a good-natured fellow, I will give you my\nhalf-smoked cigars.”\n\nM. Wilkie seemed delighted. He had climbed on to the piano and seated\nhimself, with his feet on the keyboard; and there, as on a judgment\nseat, he listened and applauded, alternately taking Chupin’s part, and\nthen the viscount’s. “Bravo, gamin!” or, “Give it to him, Coralth!” he\nshouted in turn.\n\nThis irritated the viscount exceedingly. “I see that we shall be obliged\nto call in the police to settle the affair,” he said, sneeringly.\n\n“The police!” roared Chupin. “Ah! that won’t do, you scamp--” But his\nvoice died away in his throat, and he stood motionless, speechless, with\nhis arm raised as if he were about to strike, and his eyes dilated with\nastonishment.\n\nFor a change of expression in M. de Coralth’s face had enlightened him;\nand he suddenly recollected when and under what circumstances he had\nknown this so-called viscount. He remembered, too, the name he had borne\nwhen he first met him. “Oh!” he stammered; “oh! oh!”\n\nHowever, the effect of this discovery was to dispel his anger, or rather\nto restore his calmness, and, addressing M. de Coralth, he exclaimed:\n“Don’t be angry at what I’ve said, m’sieur; it was only a jest--I\nknow that there’s a wide difference between a poor devil like me and a\nviscount like you--I haven’t a sou, you see, and that maddens me. But\nI’m not so very bad-looking, fortunately, and I’m always hoping that\nthe daughter of some rich banker will fall in love with me and marry me.\nSome people have such luck, you know. If I meet with any you may be sure\nI shall pass myself off as the lost child of some great personage--of\na duke, for instance--and if the real son exists, and troubles me, why\nI’ll quietly put him out of the way, if possible.”\n\nWith but one exception the persons present did not understand a single\nword of this apparent nonsense; and indeed the yellow-haired damsels\nstared at the speaker in amazement. Still it was evident that each of\nthese words had a meaning, and a terrible meaning for M. de Coralth.\nAccustomed for years to control his features, he remained apparently\nunmoved--he even smiled; but a close observer could have detected\nanguish in his eyes, and he had become very pale. At last, unable to\nendure the scene any longer, he drew a hundred-franc bank-note from\nhis pocketbook, crumpled it in his hand and threw it at Chupin, saying:\n“That’s a very pretty story you are telling, my boy; but we’ve had\nenough of it. Take your pay and leave us.”\n\nUnfortunately, the note struck Chupin full in the face. He uttered a\nhoarse cry of rage, and, by the way in which he seized and brandished an\nempty bottle, it might have been imagined that M. de Coralth was about\nto have his head broken. But no. Thanks to a supreme effort of will,\nChupin conquered this mad fury; and, dropping the bottle, he remarked\nto the young women who were uttering panic-stricken shrieks: “Be quiet;\ndon’t you see that I was only in fun.”\n\nBut even M. Wilkie had found the fun a little rough, and even dangerous.\nSeveral of the young fellows present sprang up, with the evident\nintention of pushing Chupin out of the room, but he checked them with\na gesture. “Don’t disturb yourselves, gentlemen,” he said. “I’m going,\nonly let me find the bank-note which this gentleman threw at me.”\n\n“That’s quite proper,” replied M. Wilkie, approvingly; “look for it.”\n\nChupin did so, and at last found it lying almost under the piano. “Now,”\n he remarked, “I should like a cigar.”\n\nA score or so were lying in a dish. He gravely selected one of them\nand coolly cut off the end of it before placing it in his mouth.\nThose around watched him with an air of profound astonishment, not\nunderstanding this ironical calmness following so closely upon such a\nstorm of passion. Then he, Victor Chupin, who had, it seems to me, but\none aim in life--to become rich--Victor Chupin, who loved money above\nanything else, and had stifled all other passions in his soul--he who\noften worked two whole days to earn five francs--he who did not disdain\nto claim his five sous when he went to hire a cab for his employer--he,\nChupin, twisted the bank-note in his fingers, lit it at the gas, and\nused it to light his cigar.\n\n“Ah! he’s crazy!” murmured the yellow-haired damsels, with despair in\ntheir voices.\n\nBut M. Wilkie was enthusiastic. “There’s form!” said he. “Fine form and\nno mistake!”\n\nBut Chupin did not even deign to turn his head. He opened the door, and\nstanding on the threshold, he bowed to M. de Coralth with an ironical\nsmile. “Until we meet again, Monsieur Paul,” said he. “And kindly\nremember me to Madame Paul, if you please.”\n\nIf the others had been less astonished, they would have no doubt have\nremarked the prodigious effect of this name upon their brilliant friend.\nHe became ghastly pale and fell back in his chair. Then, suddenly,\nhe bounded up as if he wished to attack his enemy. But pursuit seemed\nlikely to yield no result, for Chupin was already on the boulevard.\n\nIt was daybreak. Paris was waking up; the bakers were standing at their\ndoors, and boys in their shirt-sleeves, with their eyes swollen with\nsleep, were taking down the shutters of the wine-shops. A cloud of dust,\nraised by the street-sweepers, hung in the distance; the rag-pickers\nwandered about, peering among the rubbish; the noisy milk-carts jolted\nalong at a gallop, and workmen were proceeding to their daily toil,\nwith hunches of bread in their hands. The morning air was very chilly;\nnevertheless, Chupin seated himself on a bench across the boulevard, at\na spot where he could watch the entrance of the restaurant without\nbeing seen. He had just experienced one of those sudden shocks which so\ndisturb the mind, that one becomes insensible to outward circumstances,\nwhatever they may be. He had recognized in the so-called Viscount de\nCoralth, the man whom he had hated above all others in the world,\nor, rather, the only man whom he hated, for his was not a bad heart.\nImpressionable to excess like a true child of the faubourgs, he had the\nParisian’s strange mobility of feeling. If his anger was kindled by\na trifle, the merest nothing usually sufficed to extinguish it. But\nmatters were different respecting this handsome viscount! “God! how I\nhate him!” he hissed through his set teeth. “God! how I hate him!”\n\nFor once, years before, as he had confessed to M. Fortunat, Chupin had\nbeen guilty of a cowardly and abominable act, which had nearly cost\na man his life. And this crime, if it had been successful, would have\nbenefited the very fellow who concealed his sinful, shameful past\nunder the high-sounding name of Coralth. How was it that Chupin had not\nrecognized him at once? Because he had worked for this fellow without\nknowing him, receiving his orders through the miserable wretches who\npandered to his vices. He had only seen him personally once or twice,\nand had never spoken to him. Later--too late--he discovered what\nvile intrigue it was that he had served. And when he became sincerely\nrepentant he loathed this Coralth who had caused his crime.\n\nNor was this all. The recognition of Coralth had inspired him with\nremorse. It had aroused in the recesses of his conscience a threatening\nvoice which cried: “What are you doing here? You are acting as a spy for\na man you distrust, and whose real designs you are ignorant of. It was\nin this way you began before. Have you forgotten what it led to? Have\nyou not sin enough already upon your conscience? Blood enough upon your\nhands? It is folly to pretend that one may serve as a tool for villains,\nand still remain an honest man!”\n\nIt was this voice which had given Chupin the courage to light his cigar\nwith the bank-note. And this voice still tortured him, as seated on the\nbench he now tried to review the situation. Where, indeed, was he? With\nrare good luck he had discovered the son whom Madame Lia d’Argeles had\nso long and successfully concealed. But contrary to all expectations,\nthis young fellow already knew of the inheritance which he was entitled\nto. M. de Coralth had already achieved what M. Fortunat had meant to do;\nand so the plan was a failure, and it was useless to persist in it.\n\nThis would have ended the matter if Chupin had not chanced to know\nthe Viscount de Coralth’s shameful past. And this knowledge changed\neverything, for it gave him the power to interfere in a most effectual\nmanner. Armed with this secret, he could bestow the victory on M.\nFortunat, and force M. de Coralth to capitulate. And he could do this\nall the more easily, as he was sure that Coralth had not recognized\nhim, and that he was perhaps ignorant of his very existence. Chupin had\nallowed himself to be carried away by a sudden impulse of anger which\nhe regretted; he had made an ironical illusion to his enemy’s past life,\nbut after all this had done no particular harm. So nothing prevented him\nfrom lending M. Fortunat his assistance, and thus killing two birds with\none stone. He could have his revenge on Coralth, and at the same time\ninsure his patron a large fee, of which he could claim a considerable\nshare for himself. But no! The idea of deriving any profit whatever from\nthis affair inspired him with a feeling of disgust--honor triumphed over\nhis naturally crafty and avaricious nature. It seemed to him that any\nmoney made in this way would soil his fingers; for he realized there\nmust be some deep villainy under all this plotting and planning; he was\nsure of it, since Coralth was mixed up in the affair. “I will serve\nmy guv’nor for nothing,” he decided. “When a man is avenged, he’s well\npaid.”\n\nChupin decided upon this course because he could think of no better\nplan. Still, if he had been master of events he would have acted\notherwise. He would have quietly presented the government with this\ninheritance which he found M. Wilkie so unworthy of. “The devil only\nknows what he’ll do with it,” he thought. “He’ll squander it as my\nfather squandered the fortune that was given him. It is only fools who\nmeet with such luck as that.”\n\nHowever, his meditations did not prevent him from keeping a close watch\nover the restaurant, for it was of the utmost importance that M. Wilkie\nshould not escape him. It was now broad daylight, and customers were\nleaving the establishment; for, after passing what is generally conceded\nto be a joyous night, they felt the need of returning home to rest and\nsleep. Chupin watched them as they emerged. There were some who came out\nwith drooping heads, mumbling incoherent phrases; while others who were\nequally intoxicated, but more nervous, evinced considerable animation,\nand sang snatches of songs, or jested loudly with the street-sweepers as\nthey passed on. The more sober, surprised by the sunlight, and blushing\nat themselves, slunk hastily and quietly away. There was one man,\nmoreover, whom the waiters were obliged to carry to his cab, for he\ncould no longer stand on his feet.\n\nAt last Chupin saw the individual clad in black whom Wilkie had\naddressed as Philippe, and who had endeavored to prevent him from\nentering the restaurant, come out, and walk rapidly away. He was warmly\nclad in a thick overcoat, but he shivered, and his pale, wan face\nbetrayed the man who is a martyr to the pleasures of others--the man who\nis condemned to be up all night and sleep only in the daytime--the man\nwho can tell you how much folly and beastliness lurk in the depths of\nthe wine-cup, and who knows exactly how many yawns are expressed by the\nverb “to amuse one’s self.” Chupin was beginning to feel uneasy. “Can M.\nWilkie and his friends have made their escape?” he wondered.\n\nBut at that very moment they made their appearance. They lingered awhile\non the pavement to chat, and Chupin had an opportunity of observing\nthe effect of their night’s dissipation on their faces. The brilliant\nsunlight made their eyes blink, and the cold sent purple blotches to\ntheir bloated cheeks. As for the young women with yellow hair, they\nappeared as they really were--hideous. They entered the only cab that\nremained, the most dilapidated one of all, and the driver of which\nhad no little difficulty in setting his horse in motion; whereupon the\ngentlemen went off on foot.\n\nMany persons would have been vexed and even humiliated by the necessity\nof appearing at this hour on the boulevard in disorderly attire, which\nplainly indicated that they had spent the night in debauchery. But\nwith the exception of the Viscount de Coralth, who was evidently out of\nhumor, the party seemed delighted with themselves, as it was easy to\nsee by the way they met the glances of the passers-by. They considered\nthemselves first-class form--they were producing an effect--they were\nastonishing people. And what more could they desire?\n\nOne thing is certain--they were irritating Chupin terribly. He was\nfollowing them on the opposite side of the boulevard, at some little\ndistance in the rear, for he was afraid of being recognized. “The\nwretches!” he growled. “One couldn’t draw a pint of manly blood from the\nveins of all six of them. Ah, if they knew how I hate them!”\n\nBut he had not long to nurse his wrath. On reaching the Rue Drouot,\ntwo of the gentlemen left the party, and two more went down the Rue\nLepelletier. M. Wilkie and the viscount were left to walk down the\nboulevard alone. They linked their arms and carried on an animated\nconversation until they reached the Rue du Helder, where they shook\nhands and separated. What had they said at parting? What agreement had\nbeen made between them? Chupin would willingly have given a hundred sous\nfrom his private purse to have known. He would have given as much more\nto have been able to double himself, in order to pursue the viscount,\nwho had started off in the direction of the Madeleine, without having to\ngive up watching and following his friend. But the days of miracles are\nover. So Chupin sighed, and, following Wilkie, he soon saw him enter\nNo. 48 of the Rue du Helder. The concierge, who was at the door busily\nengaged in polishing the bell-handle, bowed respectfully. “So there it\nis!” grumbled Chupin. “I knew he lived there--I knew it by the way that\nMadame d’Argeles looked at the windows yesterday evening. Poor woman!\nAh! her son’s a fine fellow and no mistake!”\n\nHis compassion for the unhappy mother seemed to recall him to a sense\nof duty. “Scoundrel that I am!” he exclaimed, striking his forehead with\nhis clenched fist. “Why, I’m forgetting my own good mother!” And as his\ntask was now ended, he started off on the run, taking the shortest cut\nto the Faubourg Saint-Denis. “Poor mother!” he said to himself as he\ntore along, “what a night she must have had! She must have cried her\neyes out!”\n\nHe spoke the truth. The poor woman had passed a night of agony--counting\nthe hours, and trembling each time the door of the house opened,\nannouncing some tenant’s return. And as morning approached, her anxiety\nincreased. “For her son would not have allowed her to remain in such\nsuspense,” she said to herself, “unless he had met with some accident or\nencountered some of his former friends--those detestable scamps who had\ntried to make him as vile as themselves.” Perhaps he had met his father,\nPolyte Chupin, the man whom she still loved in spite of everything,\nbecause he was her husband, but whom she judged, and whom indeed she\nknew, to be capable of any crime. And of all misfortunes, it was an\naccident, even a fatal accident, that she dreaded least. In her heroic\nsoul the voice of honor spoke even more loudly than the imperious\ninstinct of maternity; and she would rather have found her son lying\ndead on the marble slabs of the Morgue than seated in the dock at the\nAssize Court.\n\nHer poor eyes were weary of weeping when she at last recognized Victor’s\nfamiliar step approaching down the passage. She hastily opened the door,\nand as soon as she FELT that he was near her, for she could not see him,\nshe asked: “Where have you spent the night? Where have you come from?\nWhat has happened?”\n\nHis only answer was to fling his arms round her neck, following alike\nthe impulse of his heart and the advice of experience, which told him\nthat this would be the best explanation he could give. Still it did not\nprevent him from trying to justify himself, although he was careful not\nto confess the truth, for he dreaded his mother’s censure, knowing well\nenough that she would be less indulgent than his own conscience.\n\n“I believe you, my son,” said the good woman, gravely; “you wouldn’t\ndeceive me, I’m sure.” And she added: “What reassured me, when you\nkissed me, was that you hadn’t been drinking.”\n\nChupin did not speak a word; this confidence made him strangely uneasy.\n“May I be hung,” he thought, “if after this I ever do anything that I\ncan’t confess to this poor good woman!”\n\nBut he hadn’t time for sentimental reflections. He had gone too far\nto draw back, and it was necessary for him to report the result of his\nresearches as soon as possible. Accordingly, he hastily ate a morsel,\nfor he was faint with hunger, and started out again, promising to return\nto dinner. He was in all the greater haste as it was Sunday. M. Fortunat\nwas in the habit of passing these days in the country, and Chupin feared\nhe might fail to see him if he was not expeditious in his movements. And\nwhile running to the Place de la Bourse, he carefully prepared the story\nhe meant to relate, deeply impressed by the wisdom of the popular maxim\nwhich says: “It is not always well to tell the whole truth.” Ought he\nto describe the scene at the restaurant, mention Coralth, and say that\nthere was nothing more to be done respecting M. Wilkie? After mature\ndeliberation he decided in the negative. If he revealed everything, M.\nFortunat might become discouraged and abandon the affair. It would be\nbetter to let him discover the truth himself, and profit by his anger to\nindicate a means of vengeance.\n\nIt happened that M. Fortunat had decided not to go to the country\nthat Sunday. He had slept later than usual, and was still in his\ndressing-gown when Chupin made his appearance. He uttered a joyful cry\non seeing his emissary, feeling assured that he must be the bearer\nof good news, since he came so early. “You have succeeded, then?” he\nexclaimed.\n\n“Yes, monsieur.”\n\n“You have discovered Madame d’Argeles’s son?”\n\n“I have him.”\n\n“Ah! I knew that you were a clever fellow. Quick, tell me everything.\nBut no, wait a moment.”\n\nHe rang the bell, and Madame Dodelin at once made her appearance. “Put\nanother plate on the table,” said the agent. “M. Chupin will breakfast\nwith me--and serve us at once. You agree, don’t you, Victor? It’s ten\no’clock; I’m hungry; and we can talk better over a bottle of wine.”\n\nThis was a great honor; and it gave Chupin a fitting idea of the value\nof the service he had rendered. He was not too much elated, however;\nthough he felt very sorry that he had eaten before he came. On his side,\nM. Fortunat by no means regretted having conferred this favor on his\nclerk, for the story which the latter related, caused him intense\ndelight. “Very good!--well done,” he exclaimed every other minute. “I\ncould not have done better myself. You shall be abundantly rewarded,\nVictor, if this affair is successful.” And at this thought his\nsatisfaction overflowed in a complacent monologue: “Why shouldn’t it\nsucceed?” he asked himself. “Could anything be more simple and certain?\nI can make any demand I please--one, two, three hundred thousand francs.\nAh, it was a good thing that the Count de Chalusse died! Now, I can\nforgive Valorsay. Let him keep my forty thousand francs; he’s quite\nwelcome to them! Let him marry Mademoiselle Marguerite; I wish them\na large and flourishing family! And Madame d’Argeles, too, has my\nbenediction!”\n\nHe was so confident his fortune was made that at noon he could restrain\nhimself no longer. He hired a cab and accompanied by Chupin he set out\nfor M. Wilkie’s abode, declaring that he would wake that young gentleman\nup if needs be, but at all events he must see him without delay. When he\nreached the Rue du Helder, he told Chupin to wait in the cab, and then\nentering the house, he asked: “Monsieur Wilkie?”\n\n“On the second floor, the door to the right,” replied the concierge.\n\nM. Fortunat ascended the stairs very slowly, for he felt the necessity\nof regaining all his composure, and it was not until he had brought\nhimself to a proper frame of mind that he rang the bell. A small\nservant, M. Wilkie’s fag, who took his revenge in robbing his employer\nmost outrageously, came to the door, and began by declaring that his\nmaster was out of town. But M. Fortunat understood how to force doors\nopen, and his manoeuvres succeeded so well that he was finally allowed\nto enter a small sitting-room, while the servant went off, saying: “I\nwill go and inform monsieur.”\n\nInstead of wasting time in congratulating himself on this first\nachievement the agent began to inspect the room in which he found\nhimself, as well as another apartment, the door of which stood open. For\nhe was of the opinion that a dwelling-place indicates the character of\nits inmate, as surely as a shell indicates the form of the creature that\ninhabits it. M. Wilkie was comfortably lodged; but his rooms were\nmost pretentiously ornamented. They were indeed decorated in more\nthan doubtful taste. There were very few books lying about, but costly\nriding-whips, spurs, rifles, cartridge-boxes, and all the paraphernalia\nof a fashionable sporting man, were here in abundance.\n\nThe only pictures on the wall were a few portraits of celebrated horses,\nwhich foreshadowed the fact that M. Wilkie must have, at least, an\neighth share in some well-known racer. After this inspection, M.\nFortunat smiled complacently. “This young fellow has expensive tastes,”\n he thought. “It will be very easy to manage him.”\n\nHowever his reflections were interrupted by the return of the servant,\nwho exclaimed: “My master is in the dining-room, and if monsieur will\nenter----”\n\nThe heir-hunter did enter, and found himself face to face with M.\nWilkie, who was partaking of a cup of chocolate. He was not only up,\nbut he was dressed to go out--dressed in such a style that he would have\nbeen taken for a respectable groom. A couple of hours’ sleep had made\nhim himself again; and he had regained the arrogance of manner which was\nthe distinguishing trait of his character, and a sure sign that he was\nin prosperous circumstances. As his unknown visitor entered he looked\nup, and bruskly asked: “What do you want?”\n\n“I called on business, monsieur.”\n\n“Ah, well! this isn’t a favorable moment. I must be at Vincennes for the\nraces. I’m interested in a horse. So, you understand----”\n\nM. Fortunat was secretly amused by M. Wilkie’s nonchalance. “The young\nfellow won’t be in so much of a hurry when he learns my business,” he\nthought. And he replied aloud: “I can explain what brings me in a few\nwords, monsieur.”\n\n“Proceed, then.”\n\nM. Fortunat began by closing the door which had been intentionally left\nopen by the servant; and then, returning to M. Wilkie’s side, he began\nwith an air of the greatest mystery: “What would you give a shrewd\nman if he suddenly placed you in undisputed possession of an immense\nfortune--of a million--two millions, perhaps?”\n\nHe had prepared this little effect most carefully, and he fully expected\nto see Wilkie fall on his knees before him. But not at all; the young\ngentleman’s face never moved a muscle; and it was in the calmest\npossible tone, and with his mouth half full that he replied: “I know\nthe rest. You come, don’t you, to sell me the secret of an unclaimed\ninheritance, which belongs to me? Very well, you have come too late.”\n\nIf the ceiling had fallen and crushed M. Fortunat there and then he\nwould, mentally at least, have not been in a more pitiable condition. He\nstood silent, motionless, utterly confounded, with his mouth wide open,\nand such an expression of consternation in his eyes that M. Wilkie\nburst into a hearty laugh. Still the agent struggled against fate, and\nultimately faltered: “Let me explain--permit me----”\n\n“Oh, it would be useless. I know my rights. I have already arranged with\na party to prosecute my claims; the agreement will be signed on the day\nafter to-morrow.”\n\n“With whom?”\n\n“Ah, excuse me; that’s my affair.”\n\nHe had finished his chocolate, and he now poured out a glass of\nice-water, drank it, wiped his mouth, and rose from the table. “You will\nexcuse me, my dear sir, if I leave you,” he remarked. “As I said before,\nI am going to Vincennes. I have staked a thousand louis on ‘Pompier de\nNanterre,’ my horse, and my friends have ventured ten times as much. Who\nknows what may happen if I’m not there at the start?” And then, ignoring\nM. Fortunat as completely as if he had not existed, M. Wilkie exclaimed:\n“Toby, you fool! where are you? Is my carriage below? Quick, bring me my\ncane, my gloves, and my glasses. Take down that basket of champagne. Run\nand put on your new livery. Make haste, you little beast, I shall be too\nlate.”\n\nM. Fortunat left the room. The frightful anger that had followed his\nidiotic stupor sent his blood rushing madly to his brain. A purple mist\nswam before his eyes; there was a loud ringing in his ears, and with\neach pulsation of his heart his head seemed to receive a blow from\na heavy hammer. His feelings were so terrible that he was really\nfrightened. “Am I about to have an attack of apoplexy?” he wondered.\nAnd, as every surrounding object seemed to whirl around him, the very\nfloor itself apparently rising and falling under his feet, he remained\non the landing waiting for this horrible vertigo to subside and doing\nhis best to reason with himself. It was fully five minutes before he\ndared to risk the descent; and even when he reached the street, his\nfeatures were so frightfully distorted that Chupin trembled.\n\nHe sprang out, assisted his employer into the cab, and bade the driver\nreturn to the Place de la Bourse. It was really pitiful to see the\ndespair which had succeeded M. Fortunat’s joyful confidence. “This is\nthe end of everything,” he groaned. “I’m robbed, despoiled, ruined! And\nsuch a sure thing as it seemed. These misfortunes happen to no one but\nme! Some one in advance of me! Some one else will capture the prize! Oh,\nif I knew the wretch, if I only knew him!”\n\n“One moment,” interrupted Chupin; “I think know the man.”\n\nM. Fortunat gave a violent start. “Impossible!” he exclaimed.\n\n“Excuse me, monsieur--it must be a vile rascal named Coralth.”\n\nIt was a bellow rather than a cry of rage that escaped M. Fortunat’s\nlips. To a man of his experience, only a glimmer of light was required\nto reveal the whole situation. “Ah! I understand!--I see!” he exclaimed.\n“Yes, you are right, Victor; it’s he--Coralth--Valorsay’s tool! Coralth\nwas the traitor who, in obedience to Valorsay’s orders, ruined the\nman who loved Mademoiselle Marguerite. The deed was done at Madame\nd’Argeles’s house. So Coralth knows her, and knows her secret. It’s he\nwho has outwitted me.” He reflected for a moment, and then, in a very\ndifferent tone, he said: “I shall never see a penny of the count’s\nmillions, and my forty thousand francs are gone forever; but, as Heaven\nhears me, I will have some satisfaction for my money. Ah!--so Coralth\nand Valorsay combine to ruin me! Very well!--since this is the case,\nI shall espouse the cause of Mademoiselle Marguerite and of the\nunfortunate man they’ve ruined. Ah, my cherubs, you don’t know Fortunat\nyet! Now well see if the innocent don’t get the best of you, and if they\ndon’t unmask you. I shall do my best, since you have forced me to do\nit--and gratis too!”\n\nChupin was radiant; his vengeance was assured. “And I, monsieur,” said\nhe, “will give you some information about this Coralth. First of all,\nthe scoundrel’s married and his wife keeps a tobacco-shop somewhere near\nthe Route d’Asnieres. I’ll find her for you--see if I don’t.”\n\nThe sudden stopping of the vehicle which had reached the Place de la\nBourse, cut his words short. M. Fortunat ordered him to pay the\ndriver, while he himself rushed upstairs, eager to arrange his plan of\ncampaign--to use his own expression. In his absence a commissionaire had\nbrought a letter for him which Madame Dodelin now produced. He broke the\nseal, and read to his intense surprise: “Monsieur--I am the ward of\nthe late Count de Chalusse. I must speak to you. Will you grant me an\ninterview on Wednesday next, at a quarter-past three o’clock? Yours\nrespectfully,\n\n                                    “MARGUERITE.”\n\n\n\n\nXX.\n\n\nWhen Mademoiselle Marguerite left the dead count’s bedside at ten\no’clock at night to repair to Pascal Ferailleur’s house, she did not yet\ndespair of the future. Father, friend, rank, security, fortune--she had\nlost all these in a single moment--but she could still see a promise of\nhappiness in the distance.\n\nShe suffered undoubtedly, and yet she experienced a sort of bitter\npleasure at the thought of uniting her life to the man who was as\nunfortunate as herself, who was slandered as she herself had been\nslandered, branded with the most cruel and unjust imputations, and had\nneither fortune nor friends. Others might scorn them; but what did they\ncare for the world’s disdain so long as they had the approval of their\nconsciences? Would not their mutual esteem suffice since they loved each\nother? It seemed to Marguerite that their very misfortunes would bind\nthem more closely to each other, and cement the bonds of their love\nmore strongly. And if it were absolutely necessary for them to leave\nFrance--ah, well! they would leave it. To them Fatherland would always\nbe the spot where they lived together.\n\nAs the cab approached the Rue d’Ulm she pictured Pascal’s sorrow, and\nthe joy and surprise he would feel when she suddenly appeared before\nhim, and faltered: “They accuse you--here I am! I know that you are\ninnocent, and I love you!”\n\nBut the brutal voice of the concierge, informing her of Pascal’s secret\ndeparture, in the most insulting terms, abruptly dispelled her dreams.\nIf Pascal had failed her, everything had failed her. If she had lost\nhim, she had lost her all. The world seemed empty--struggling would be\nfolly--happiness was only an empty name. She indeed longed for death!\n\nMadame Leon who had a set of formulas adapted to all circumstances,\nundertook to console her. “Weep, my dear young lady, weep; it will do\nyou good. Ah! this is certainly a horrible catastrophe. You are young,\nfortunately, and Time is a great consoler. M. Ferailleur isn’t the\nonly man on earth. Others will love you. There are others who love you\nalready!”\n\n“Silence!” interrupted Marguerite, more revolted than if she had heard\na libertine whispering shameful proposals in her ear. “Silence! I forbid\nyou to add another word.” To speak of another--what sacrilege! Poor\ngirl. She was one of those whose life is bound up in one love alone, and\nif that fails them--it is death!\n\nThe thought that she was utterly alone added to the horror of her\nsituation. Whom could she depend upon? Not on Madame Leon. She\ndistrusted her; she had no confidence whatever in her. Should she\nask for the advice of either of her suitors? The Marquis de Valorsay\ninspired her with unconquerable aversion, and she despised the so-called\nGeneral de Fondege. So her only friend, her only protector was a\nstranger, the old justice of the peace who had taken her defence, by\ncrushing the slander of the servants, and whom she had opened her heart\nto. But he would soon forget her, she thought; and the future, such as\nit was presented to her imagination, seemed a terrible one. However, she\nwas too courageous to remain for long in despair--she struggled against\nher sorrow; and the thought that she might, perhaps, reach Pascal\nthrough M. Fortunat at last occurred to her mind. This hope was her sole\nchance of salvation. She clung to it as a shipwrecked mariner clings to\nthe plank which is his only hope of life.\n\nWhen she returned to the mansion her mind was made up, and she had\nregained her usual composure. For ten minutes or so she had been praying\nby the count’s bedside, when M. Bourigeau, the concierge, appeared and\nhanded her a letter which had just been brought to the house. It was\naddressed to “Mademoiselle Marguerite de Durtal de Chalusse, at the\nHotel de Chalusse, Rue de Courcelles.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite blushed. Who was it that addressed her by\nthis name which she no longer had the right to bear? She studied the\nhandwriting for a moment, but she did not remember ever having seen it\nbefore. At last, however, she opened the letter and read: “My dear,\ndear child.” “Dear child!” indeed. What could this mean? Was there any\none in the world sufficiently interested in her welfare, or loving her\nenough, to address her in this style? She quickly turned the sheet to\nsee the signature; and when her eyes fell on it she turned pale. “Ah!”\n she exclaimed, involuntarily, “ah! ah!”\n\nThe letter was signed: “Athenais de Fondege.” It had been written by\nthe General’s wife. She resumed her perusal of it, and this is what she\nread: “I this instant hear of the cruel loss you have sustained, and\nalso learn that, for want of testamentary provisions, the poor Count de\nChalusse leaves you, his idolized daughter, almost without resources. I\nwill not attempt to offer you consolation, God alone can assuage certain\nsorrows. I should come and weep with you if I were not kept in bed by\nillness. But to-morrow, whatever happens, I shall be with you before\nbreakfast. It is at such a time as this, my poor dear afflicted child,\nthat one can tell one’s true friends; and we are yours as I hope to\nprove. The General feels that he should be insulting and betraying the\nmemory of a man who was his dearest friend for thirty years, if he did\nnot take the count’s place, if he did not become your second father.\nHe has offered you our modest home; you have refused. Why? With the\nauthority conferred upon me by my age and my position as the mother of\na family, I tell you that you ought to accept. What other course can you\npossibly think of? Where would you go, my poor, dear child? But we will\ndiscuss this matter to-morrow. I shall find a way to persuade you to\nlove us, and to allow yourself to be loved. In MY heart you will fill\nthe place of the beloved and lamented daughter I have lost--my beautiful\nand gentle Bathilde. Once more I say farewell until to-morrow--trusting\nthat you will accept the sympathy and affection of your best friend,\n\n                             “ATHENAIS DE FONDEGE.”\n\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite was thunderstruck, for the writer of this\nepistle was a lady whom she had only met five or six times, who had\nnever visited her, and with whom she had scarcely exchanged twenty\nwords. Moreover, she well remembered certain glances with which Madame\nde Fondege had, on one occasion, tried to crush her--glances so full of\ncruel contempt that they had drawn bitter tears of sorrow, shame, and\nanger, from the poor girl. The count himself had said to her at the\ntime: “Don’t be so childish, Marguerite, as to trouble yourself about\nthis foolish and impudent woman.”\n\nAnd now this same woman sent her a letter overflowing with sympathy,\nand claimed her affection and confidence in the tone of an old and tried\nfriend. Was such a change natural? Not being what is called a credulous\nperson, Mademoiselle Marguerite was unable to believe it. She divined\nthat Madame de Fondege must have had some hidden motive in writing such\na letter--but what motive was it? Alas! she divined this also only too\nwell. The General, suspecting that she had stolen the missing money, had\nimparted his suspicions to his wife; and she, being as avaricious and as\nunscrupulous as himself, was doing her best to secure the booty for her\nson. Such a calculation is a common one nowadays. Steal yourself? Fie.\nnever! You would not dare. Besides, you are honest. But it is quite a\ndifferent thing to profit by other people’s rascality. Besides, there\nare no risks to be encountered.\n\nOn perusing the letter a second time, it seemed to Mademoiselle\nMarguerite that she could hear the General and his wife discussing the\nmeans of obtaining a share of the two millions. She could hear Madame de\nFondege saying to her husband: “You are a block-head! You frightened the\ngirl by your precipitancy and roughness. But fortunately, I’m here. Let\nme manage the affair; and I’ll prove that women are far more clever than\nmen.” And, thereupon, she had seized her pen, and commenced this letter.\nIn Mademoiselle Marguerite’s opinion, the epistle betrayed the joint\nefforts of the pair. She could have sworn that the husband had dictated\nthe sentence: “The General feels that he should be insulting and\nbetraying the memory of a man who was his dearest friend for thirty\nyears, if he did not become your second father.” On the other hand, the\nphrase, “I shall find a way to persuade you to love us, and to allow\nyourself to be loved,” was unmistakably the wife’s work. The writer’s\ninsincerity was fully revealed by one passage of the letter. “You will\nfill the place of the beloved daughter I have lost,” wrote Madame de\nFondege. It is true that she had once had a daughter; but the child had\ndied of croup when only six months old, and more than twenty-five years\npreviously.\n\nIt was strange, moreover, that this letter had not been sent until ten\no’clock in the evening; but, on reflection, Mademoiselle Marguerite\nwas able to explain this circumstance satisfactorily to herself. Before\ntaking any decided step, M. and Madame de Fondege had wished to consult\ntheir son; and they had been unable to see him until late in the\nevening. However, as soon as the brilliant hussar had approved the noble\nscheme concocted by his parents, a servant had been dispatched with\nthe letter. All these surmises were surely very plausible; but it\nwas difficult to reconcile them with the opinion advanced by the\nmagistrate--that M. de Fondege must know what had become of the missing\nmillions.\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite did not think of this, however. She was losing\nher presence of mind at thought of the odious suspicions which rested\non her, suspicions which she had seemed to read in the eyes of all who\napproached her, from Dr. Jodon to the Marquis de Valorsay. It is true\nthat the magistrate had taken her defence; he had silenced the servants,\nbut would that suffice? Would she not remain branded by an abominable\naccusation? And even the consciousness of her innocence did not reassure\nher, for Pascal’s case warned her that innocence is not a sufficient\nsafeguard against slander.\n\nCould she hope to escape when he had succumbed? She could tell by the\nagony that was torturing her own heart, how much he must have suffered.\nWhere was he now? Beyond the frontiers of France? They had told her so,\nbut she did not, could not believe it. Knowing him as she knew him, it\nseemed to her impossible that he had accepted his fate so quickly and\nwithout a struggle. A secret presentiment told her that his absence was\nonly feigned, that he was only biding his time, and that M. Fortunat\nwould not have far to go in search of him. It was in M. de Chalusse’s\nbedroom that she thus reflected, but a few steps from the bed on which\nreposed all that was mortal of the man whose weakness had made her life\none long martyrdom, whose want of foresight had ruined her future, but\nwhom she had not the heart to censure. She was standing in front of the\nwindow with her burning forehead resting against the glass. At that very\nmoment Pascal was waiting, seated on the curbstone opposite the mansion.\nAt that very moment he was watching the shadow on the window-curtain,\nwondering if it were not Marguerite’s. If the night had been clear she\nmight have discerned the motionless watcher in the street below, and\ndivined that it was Pascal. But how could she suspect his presence? How\ncould she suspect that he had hastened to the Rue de Courcelles as she\nhad hastened to the Rue d’Ulm?\n\nIt was almost midnight when a slight noise, a sound of stealthy\nfootsteps, made her turn. Madame Leon was leaving the room, and a moment\nlater Marguerite heard the house-door leading into the garden open and\nshut again. There was nothing extraordinary about such an occurrence,\nand yet a strange misgiving assailed her. Why, she could not explain;\nbut many trivial circumstances, suddenly invested with a new and\nalarming significance, recurred to her mind. She remembered that Madame\nLeon had been restless and nervous all the evening. The housekeeper,\nwho was usually so inactive, who lounged in her arm-chair for hours\ntogether, had been moving uneasily about, going up and down stairs at\nleast a dozen times, and continually glancing at her watch or the clock.\nTwice, moreover, had the concierge come to tell her that some one\nwished to see her. “Where can she be going now, at midnight?” thought\nMademoiselle Marguerite; “she who is usually so timid?”\n\nAt first, the girl resisted her desire to solve the question; her\nsuspicions seemed absurd to her, and, besides, it was distasteful to\nher to play the spy. Still, she listened, waiting to hear Madame Leon\nre-enter the house. But more than a quarter of an hour elapsed, and yet\nthe door did not open or close again. Either Madame Leon had not left\nthe house at all, or else she was still outside. “This is very strange!”\n thought Mademoiselle Marguerite. “Was I mistaken? I must convince\nmyself.” And, obeying a mysterious influence, stronger than her own\nwill, she left the room and went down the stairs. She had reached the\nhall, when the garden door suddenly opened, and Madame Leon came in. The\nlights in the hall were burning brightly, so that it was easy to observe\nthe housekeeper’s manner and countenance. She was panting for breath,\nlike a person who had been running. She was very pale, and her dress was\ndisordered. Her cap-strings were untied, and her cap had slipped from\nher head and was hanging over her shoulders. “What is the matter with\nyou?” asked Mademoiselle Marguerite in astonishment. “Where have you\nbeen?”\n\nOn seeing the girl Madame Leon recoiled. Should she fly off or remain?\nShe hesitated for an instant; and it was easy to read her hesitation in\nher eyes. She decided to remain; but it was with a constrained smile\nand in an unnatural voice that she replied: “Why do you speak to me like\nthat, my dear young lady? One might suppose you were angry with me. You\nmust know very well that I’ve been in the garden!”\n\n“At this hour of the night?”\n\n“MON DIEU! yes--and not for pleasure, I assure you--not by any\nmeans--I--I----” She was evidently seeking for some excuse; and, for\na moment or two, she stammered forth one incoherent sentence after\nanother, trying to gain time and imploring Heaven to grant her an\ninspiration.\n\n“Well?” insisted Mademoiselle Marguerite, impatiently. “Why did you go\nout?”\n\n“Ah! I--I--thought I heard Mirza barking in the garden. I thought she\nhad been forgotten in all the confusion, and that the poor creature had\nbeen shut out, so I summoned all my courage, and----”\n\nMirza was an old spaniel that M. de Chalusse had been very fond of, and\nthe animal’s caprices were respected by all the inmates of the house.\n\n“That’s very strange,” remarked Mademoiselle Marguerite, “for when you\nrose to leave the room, half an hour ago, Mirza was sleeping at your\nfeet.”\n\n“What--really--is it possible?”\n\n“It’s certain.”\n\nBut the worthy woman had already recovered her self-possession and her\naccustomed loquacity at the same time. “Ah! my dear young lady,” she\nsaid, bravely, “I’m in such sorrow that I’m losing my senses completely.\nStill, it was only from the kindest of motives that I ventured into the\ngarden, and I had scarcely entered it before I saw something white run\naway from me--I felt sure it was Mirza--and so I ran after it. But\nI could find nothing. I called ‘Mirza! Mirza!’ and still nothing. I\nsearched under all the trees, and yet I could not find her. It was as\ndark as pitch, and suddenly a terrible fear seized hold of me--such a\nterrible fright that I really believe I called for help, and I ran back\nto the house half crazed.”\n\nAny one hearing her would have sworn that she was telling the truth.\nBut, unfortunately, her earlier manner had proved her guilt.\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite was not deceived when she said to herself: “I\nam on the track of some abominable act.” However, she had sufficient\nself-control to conceal her suspicions; and she pretended to be\nperfectly satisfied with the explanation which the house-keeper had\nconcocted. “Ah, my dear Leon, you are altogether too timid; it’s\nabsurd,” she said, kindly.\n\nThe housekeeper hung her head. “I know that I make myself ridiculous,”\n she said, humbly. “But how can I help it? When a person’s frightened,\nshe can’t reason. And that white object which I saw, as plainly as I\nsee you, what could it have been?” And, convinced that her fable was\nbelieved, she grew bolder, and ventured to add: “Oh, my dear young lady,\nI shall tremble all night if the garden isn’t searched. Pray send the\nservants out to look. There are so many thieves and rascals in Paris!”\n\nUnder any other circumstances Mademoiselle Marguerite would have refused\nto listen to this ridiculous request; but, determined to repay the\nhypocrite in her own coin, she replied. “Very well; it shall be done.”\n And calling M. Casimir and Bourigeau, the concierge, she ordered them to\ntake a lantern and explore the garden carefully.\n\nThey obeyed, though with rather bad grace, not being particularly\ncourageous, either of them, and, of course, they found nothing.\n\n“No matter,” said Madame Leon, “I feel safe now.” And she did indeed\nfeel more tranquil in mind. “I had a lucky escape!” she said to herself.\n“What would have become of me, if Mademoiselle Marguerite had discovered\nthe truth?”\n\nBut the housekeeper congratulated herself on her victory too soon.\nMademoiselle Marguerite not only suspected her of treason, but she was\nendeavoring to procure proofs of it. She felt certain that the plausible\nhousekeeper had deceived her, and cruelly wronged her as well. But what\nshe could not understand was, how Madame Leon had been able to do so.\nShe had spent a long time in fruitless conjectures, when suddenly she\nremembered the little garden gate. “The deceitful creature must have\nused that gate,” she thought.\n\nIt was easy for her to verify her suspicion. The little gate had not\nbeen exactly condemned, but many months had elapsed since it had been\nused; so it would be a very simple matter to ascertain whether it had\nbeen recently opened or not. “And I will know for certain before an hour\nhas passed,” said Mademoiselle Marguerite to herself.\n\nHaving come to this conclusion, she feigned sleep, keeping a sharp watch\nover Madame Leon from between her half-closed eyelids. The housekeeper,\nafter twisting uneasily in her arm-chair, at last became quiet again;\nand it was soon evident that she was sleeping soundly. Thereupon\nMademoiselle Marguerite rose to her feet and stole noiselessly from the\nroom downstairs into the garden. She had provided herself with a candle\nand some matches, and as soon as she struck a light, she saw that her\nsurmises were correct. The little gate had just been opened and closed\nagain. The cobwebs round about the bolts were torn and broken; the rust\nwhich had filled the keyhole had been removed, and on the dust covering\nthe lock the impress of a hand could be detected. “And I have confided\nmy most precious secrets to this wicked woman!” thought Mademoiselle\nMarguerite. “Fool that I was!”\n\nAlready thoroughly convinced, she extinguished her candle. Still, having\ndiscovered so much, she wished to pursue her investigation to the end,\nand so she opened the little gate. The ground outside had been soaked\nby the recent rains, and had not yet dried, and by the light of\nthe neighboring street-lamp, she plainly distinguished a number of\nwell-defined footprints on the muddy soil. An experienced observer would\nhave realized by the disposition of these footprints that something like\na struggle had taken place here; but Mademoiselle Marguerite was not\nsufficiently expert for that. She only understood what a child would\nhave understood--that two people had been standing here for some time.\nPoor girl! She had not seen Pascal when he was sitting in front of the\nmansion some hours before! And now no presentiment warned her that these\nfootprints were his. In her opinion, the man who had been talking with\nMadame Leon was either M. de Fondege, or the Marquis de Valorsay--that\nis to say, Madame Leon was hired to watch her and to render an account\nof all she said and did.\n\nHer first impulse was to denounce and dismiss this miserable hypocrite;\nbut as she was returning to the house, an idea which an old diplomatist\nneed not have been ashamed of entered her mind. She said to herself\nthat as Madame Leon was unmasked she was no longer to be feared; so\nwhy should she be sent away? “A known spy can undoubtedly be made a most\nvaluable auxiliary. Why shouldn’t I make use of this wicked woman?”\n thought Mademoiselle Marguerite. “I can conceal from her what I don’t\nwish her to know, and with a little skill I can make her carry to her\nemployers such information as will serve my plans. By watching her, I\nshall soon discover my enemy; and who knows if, by this means, I may not\nsucceed in finding an explanation of the fatality that pursues me?”\n\nWhen Mademoiselle Marguerite returned to her place beside the count’s\nbedside, she had calmly and irrevocably made up her mind. She would\nnot only retain Madame Leon in her service, but she would display even\ngreater confidence in her than before. Such a course was most repugnant\nto Marguerite’s loyal, truthful nature; but reason whispered to her that\nin fighting with villains, it is often necessary to use their weapons;\nand she had her honor, her life, and her future to defend. A strange and\nbut imperfectly defined suspicion had entered her mind. To-night, for\nthe first time, she thought she could discover a mysterious connection\nbetween Pascal’s misfortunes and her own. Was it mere chance which had\nstruck them at the same time, and in much the same manner? Who would\nhave profited by the abominable crime which had dishonored her lover,\nhad it not been for M. de Chalusse’s death and her own firmness?\nEvidently the Marquis de Valorsay, for whom Pascal’s flight had left the\nfield clear.\n\nAll these thoughts were well calculated to drive away sleep; but the\npoor girl was only twenty, and it was the second night she had watched\nby the count’s bedside. Thus at last fatigue overcame her, and she fell\nasleep.\n\nIn the morning, about seven o’clock, Madame Leon was obliged to shake\nher to rouse her from the kind of lethargy into which she had fallen.\n“Mademoiselle,” said the housekeeper, in her honeyed voice; “dear\nmademoiselle, wake up at once!”\n\n“What is the matter? What is it?”\n\n“Ah! how can I explain? My dear young lady, the undertaker’s men have\ncome to make arrangements for the ceremony.”\n\nThose in charge of the last rites had indeed arrived, and their heavy\ntread could be heard in the hall and in the courtyard. M. Casimir, who\nwas bursting with self-sufficiency, hurried here, there? and everywhere,\nindicating, with an imperious gesture, where he wished the black\nhangings, embroidered with silver and emblazoned with the De Chalusse\narms, to be suspended. As the magistrate had given him carte-blanche,\nhe deemed it proper, as he remarked to Concierge Bourigeau, to have\neverything done in grand style. But he took good care not to reveal the\nfact that he had exacted a very handsome commission from all the people\nhe employed. The hundred francs derived from Chupin had only whetted his\nappetite for more. At all events, he had certainly spared no pains in\nview of having everything as magnificent as possible; and it was not\nuntil he considered the display thoroughly satisfactory that he went to\nwarn Mademoiselle Marguerite. “I come to beg mademoiselle to retire to\nher own room,” he said.\n\n“Retire--why?”\n\nHe did not reply by words, but pointed to the bed on which the body was\nlying, and the poor girl realized that the moment of eternal separation\nhad come. She rose, and dragged herself to the bedside. Death had\nnow effaced all traces of the count’s last agony. His face wore its\naccustomed expression again, and it might have been fancied that he was\nasleep. For a long time Mademoiselle Marguerite stood looking at him, as\nif to engrave the features she would never behold again upon her memory.\n“Mademoiselle,” insisted M. Casimir; “mademoiselle, do not remain here.”\n\nShe heard him, and summoning all her strength, she leaned over the\nbed, kissed M. de Chalusse, and went away. But she was too late, for in\npassing through the hall she encountered the undertakers, who carried on\ntheir shoulders a long metallic case enclosed in two oaken ones. And she\nhad scarcely reached her own room before a smell of resin told her that\nthe men were closing the coffin which contained all that was mortal of\nM. de Chalusse, her father.\n\nSo, none of those terrible details, which so increase one’s grief, were\nspared her. But she had already suffered so much that she had reached\na state of gloomy apathy, almost insensibility; and the exercise of her\nfaculties was virtually suspended. Whiter than marble, she fell, rather\nthan seated herself, on a chair, scarcely perceiving Madame Leon, who\nhad followed her.\n\nThe worthy housekeeper was greatly excited, and not without cause. As\nthere were no relations, it had been decided that M. de Fondege, the\ncount’s oldest friend, should do the honors of the mansion to the\npersons invited to attend the funeral; and he had sworn that he would be\nunder arms at daybreak, and that they might positively depend upon him.\nBut the hour fixed for the ceremony was approaching, several persons had\nalready arrived, and yet M. de Fondege had not put in an appearance.\n“It is incomprehensible,” exclaimed Madame Leon. “The General is usually\npunctuality personified. He must have met with some accident.” And\nin her anxiety she stationed herself at the window, whence she could\ncommand a view of the courtyard, carefully scrutinizing every fresh\narrival.\n\nAt last, about half-past nine o’clock, she suddenly exclaimed: “Here he\nis! Do you hear, mademoiselle, here’s the General!”\n\nA moment later, indeed, there was a gentle rap at the door, and M. de\nFondege entered. “Ah, I’m late!” he exclaimed; “but, dash it all! it’s\nnot my fault!” And, struck by Mademoiselle Marguerite’s immobility, he\nadvanced and took her hand. “And you, my dear little one, what is the\nmatter with you?” he asked. “Have you been ill? You are frightfully\npale.”\n\nShe succeeded in shaking off the torpor which was stealing over her, and\nreplied in a faint voice; “I am not ill, monsieur.”\n\n“So much the better, my dear child, so much the better. It is our little\nheart that is suffering, is it not? Yes--yes--I understand. But your old\nfriends will console you. You received my wife’s letter, did you not?\nAh, well! what she told you, she will do--she will do it. And to prove\nit, in spite of her illness, she followed me--in fact, she is here!”\n\n\n\n\nXXI.\n\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite sprang to her feet, quivering with indignation.\nHer eyes sparkled and her lips trembled as she threw back her head with\na superb gesture of scorn, which loosened her beautiful dark hair, and\ncaused it to fall in rippling masses over her shoulders. “Ah! Madame de\nFondege is here!” she repeated, in a tone of crushing contempt--“Madame\nde Fondege, your wife, here!”\n\nIt seemed to her an impossibility to receive the hypocrite who had\nwritten the letter of the previous evening--the accomplice of the\nscoundrels who took advantage of her wretchedness and isolation. Her\nheart revolted at the thought of meeting this woman, who had neither\nconscience nor shame, who could stoop so low as to intrigue for the\nmillions which she fancied had been stolen. Mademoiselle Marguerite was\nabout to forbid her to enter, or to retire herself, when the thought\nof her determination to act stealthily restrained her. She instantly\nrealized her imprudence, and, mastering herself with a great effort,\nshe murmured: “Madame de Fondege is too kind! How can I ever express my\ngratitude?”\n\nMadame de Fondege must have heard this, for at the same moment she\nentered the room. She was short, and very stout--a faded blonde, with\nher complexion spoilt by a multitude of freckles. She had very large\nhands, broad, thick feet, and a shrill voice; and the vulgarity of her\nappearance was all the more noticeable on account of her pretensions to\nelegance. For although her father had been a wood-merchant, she\nboasted of her exalted birth, and endeavored to impress people with\nthe magnificence of her style of living, though her fortune was\nproblematical, and her household conducted in the most frugal style.\nHer attire suggested a continual conflict between elegance and\neconomy--between real poverty and feigned prodigality. She wore\na corsage and overskirt of black satin; but the upper part of the\nunderskirt, which was not visible, was made of lute-string costing\nthirty sous a yard, and her laces were Chantilly only in appearance.\nStill, her love of finery had never carried her so far as shop-lifting,\nor induced her to part with her honor for gewgaws--irregularities which\nare so common nowadays, even among wives and mothers of families, that\npeople are no longer astonished to hear of them.\n\nNo--Madame de Fondege was a faithful wife, in the strict and legal sense\nof the word. But how she revenged herself! She was “virtuous;” but so\ndangerously virtuous that one might have supposed she was so against her\nwill, and that she bitterly regretted it. She ruled her husband with a\nrod of iron. And he who was so terrible in appearance, he who twirled\nhis ferocious mustaches in such a threatening manner, he who swore\nhorribly enough to make an old hussar blush, became more submissive\nthan a child, and more timid than a lamb when he was beside his wife.\nHe trembled when she turned her pale blue eyes upon him in a certain\nfashion. And woe to him if he ventured to rebel. She suppressed his\npocket-money, and during these penitential seasons he was reduced to the\nnecessity of asking his friends to lend him twenty-franc pieces, which\nhe generally forgot to return.\n\nMadame de Fondege was, as a rule, most imperious, envious, and spiteful\nin disposition; but on coming to the Hotel de Chalusse she had provided\nherself with any amount of sweetness and sensibility, and when she\nentered the room, she held her handkerchief to her lips as if to stifle\nher sobs. The General led her toward Mademoiselle Marguerite, and, in a\nsemi-solemn, semi-sentimental tone, he exclaimed: “Dear Athenais, this\nis the daughter of my best and oldest friend. I know your heart--I know\nthat she will find in you a second mother.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite stood speechless and rigid. Persuaded that\nMadame de Fondege was about to throw her arms round her neck and kiss\nher, she was imposing the most terrible constraint upon herself, in\norder to conceal her horror and aversion. But she was unnecessarily\nalarmed. The hypocrisy of the General’s wife was superior to that\nof Madame Leon. Madame de Fondege contented herself with pressing\nMademoiselle Marguerite’s hands and faltering: “What a misfortune! So\nyoung--so sudden! It is frightful!” And, as she received no reply,\nshe added, with an air of sorrowful dignity: “I dare not ask your full\nconfidence, my dear unfortunate child. Confidence can be born only of\nlong acquaintance and mutual esteem. But you will learn to know me. You\nwill give me that sweet name of mother when I shall have deserved it.”\n\nStanding at a little distance off, the General listened with the air of\na man who has a profound respect for his wife’s ability. “Now the ice is\nbroken,” he thought, “it will be strange if Athenais doesn’t do whatever\nshe pleases with that little savage.”\n\nHis hopes were so brightly reflected upon his countenance, that Madame\nLeon, who was furtively watching him, became alarmed. “Ah! what do these\npeople want?” she said to herself; “and what do all these endearments\nmean? Upon my word, I must warn my patron at once.” And, fancying that\nno one noticed her, she slipped quietly and noiselessly from the room.\n\nBut Mademoiselle Marguerite was on the watch. Determined to fathom the\nplotting that was going on around her, and frustrate it, she realized\nthat everything depended upon her watchfulness and her ability to\nprofit even by the most futile incidents. She had noticed the General’s\ntriumphant smile, and the look of anxiety that had suddenly clouded\nMadame Leon’s face. So, without troubling herself about “the\nproprieties,” she asked M. and Madame de Fondege to excuse her for a\nsecond, and darted alter the housekeeper. Ah! she did not need to go\nfar. Leaning over the banisters, she saw Madame Leon and the Marquis\nde Valorsay in earnest conversation in the hall below; the marquis as\nphlegmatic and as haughty as usual, but the house-keeper fairly excited.\nMarguerite at once understood that as Madame Leon knew that the marquis\nwas among the funeral guests, she had gone to warn him of Madame\nde Fondege’s presence. This trivial circumstance proved that M. de\nFondege’s interests were opposed to those of M. de Valorsay; that they\nmust, therefore, hate each other, and that, with a little patience and\nskill, she might utilize them, one against the other. It also proved\nthat Madame Leon was the Marquis de Valorsay’s paid spy and that he must\ntherefore have long been aware of Pascal’s existence. But she lacked the\ntime to follow out this train of thought. Her absence might awaken the\nFondeges’ suspicions; and her success depended on letting them suppose\nthat she was their dupe. She therefore returned to them as soon as\npossible, excusing herself for her abrupt departure as well as she\ncould; but she was not accustomed to deceive, and her embarrassment\nmight have betrayed her had it not been for the General, who fortunately\ninterrupted her by saying: “I, too, must excuse myself, my dear child;\nbut Madame de Fondege will remain with you. I must fulfil a sacred\nduty. They are waiting for me downstairs, and they are no doubt becoming\nimpatient. It is the first time in my life that I was ever behind time.”\n\nThe General was right in losing no more time. At least a hundred and\nfifty guests had assembled in the reception-rooms on the ground floor,\nand they were beginning to think it very strange that they should be\nkept waiting in this style. And yet curiosity somewhat tempered their\nimpatience. Some of the strange circumstances attending the count’s\ndeath had been noised abroad; and some well-informed persons declared\nthat a fabulous sum of money had been stolen by a young girl. It\nis true, they did not think this embezzlement a positive crime. It\ncertainly proved that the young lady in question possessed a strong and\ndetermined character; and many of the proudest among the guests would\ngladly have taken the place of De Valorsay, who, it was rumored, was\nabout to marry the pretty thief and her millions.\n\nThe person who was most disturbed by the delay was the master of the\nceremonies. Arrayed in his best uniform, his thin legs encased in black\nsilk stockings, his mantle thrown gracefully over his shoulders, and his\ncocked hat under his arm, he was looking anxiously about for some one in\nthe assembled crowd to whom he could give the signal for departure. He\nwas already talking of starting off when M. de Fondege appeared. The\nfriends of M. de Chalusse who were to hold the cords of the pall came\nforward. There was a moment’s confusion, then the hearse started, and\nthe whole cortege filed out of the courtyard.\n\nDeep silence followed, so deep that the noise made in closing the\nheavy gates came upon one with startling effect. “Ah!” moaned Madame de\nFondege, “it is over.”\n\nMarguerite’s only reply was a despairing gesture. It would have been\nimpossible for her to articulate a syllable--her tears were choking her.\nWhat would she not have given to be alone at this moment--to have\nbeen able to abandon herself without constraint to her emotions! Alas!\nprudence condemned her to play a part even now. The thought of her\nfuture and her honor lent her strength to submit to the deceitful\nconsolations of a woman whom she knew to be a dangerous enemy. And the\nGeneral’s wife was by no means sparing of her consolatory phrases; in\nfact, it was only after a long homily on the uncertainty of life below\nthat she ventured to approach the subject of her letter of the previous\nevening. “For it is necessary to face the inevitable,” she pursued. “The\ntroublesome realities of life have no respect for our grief. So it is\nwith you, my dear child; you would find a bitter pleasure in giving vent\nto your sorrow, but you are compelled to think of your future. As M. de\nChalusse has no heirs, this house will be closed--you can remain here no\nlonger.”\n\n“I know it, madame.”\n\n“Where will you go?”\n\n“Alas! I don’t know.”\n\nMadame de Fondege raised her handkerchief to her eyes as if to wipe a\nfurtive tear away, and then, almost roughly, she exclaimed: “I must tell\nyou the truth, my child. Listen to me. I see only two courses for you\nto adopt. Either to ask the protection of some respectable family, or to\nenter a convent. This is your only hope of safety.”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite bowed her head, without replying. To learn the\nplans which the General’s wife had formed she must let her disclose\nthem. However, the girl’s silence seemed to make Madame de Fondege\nuncomfortable, and at last she resumed: “Is it possible that you think\nof braving the perils of life alone? I cannot believe it! It would be\nmadness. Young, beautiful, and attractive as you are, it is impossible\nfor you to live unprotected. Even if you had sufficient strength of\ncharacter to lead a pure and honest life, the world would none the less\nrefuse you its esteem. Mere prejudice, you say? You are quite right; but\nit is nevertheless true that a young girl who braves public opinion is\nlost.”\n\nIt was easy to see by Madame de Fondege’s earnestness that she feared\nMademoiselle Marguerite would avail herself of this opportunity of\nrecovering her liberty. “What shall I do, then?” asked the girl.\n\n“There is the convent.”\n\n“But I love life.”\n\n“Then ask the protection of some respectable family.”\n\n“The idea of being in any one’s charge is disagreeable to me.”\n\nStrange to say, Madame de Fondege did not protest, did not speak of her\nown house. She was too proud for that. Having once offered hospitality,\nshe thought it would arouse suspicion if she insisted. So she contented\nherself with enumerating the arguments for and against the two\npropositions, remarking from time to time: “Come, you must decide! Don’t\nwait until the last moment!”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite had already decided but before announcing\nher decision she wished to confer with the only friend she had in the\nworld--the old justice of the peace. On the previous evening he had said\nto her: “Farewell until to-morrow,” and knowing that his work in the\nhouse had not been concluded, she was extremely surprised that he had\nnot yet put in an appearance.\n\nWhile conversing with Madame de Fondege she had dexterously avoided\ncompromising herself in any way when suddenly a servant appeared and\nannounced the magistrate’s arrival. He entered the room, with his usual\nbenevolent smile upon his lips, but his searching eyes were never once\ntaken off Madame de Fondege’s face. He bowed, made a few polite remarks,\nand then addressing Marguerite, he said: “I must speak with you,\nmademoiselle, at once. You may tell madame, however, that you will\ncertainly return in less than a quarter of an hour.”\n\nMarguerite followed him, and when they were alone in the count’s study\nand the doors had been carefully closed, the magistrate exclaimed: “I\nhave been thinking a great deal of you, my child, a great deal; and\nit seems to me that I can explain certain things which worried you\nyesterday. But first of all, what has happened since I left you?”\n\nBriefly, but with remarkable precision, Marguerite recounted the various\nincidents which had occurred--her useless journey to the Rue d’Ulm,\nMadame Leon’s strange midnight ramble and conversation with the Marquis\nde Valorsay, Madame de Fondege’s letter, and lastly, her visit and all\nthat she had said.\n\nThe magistrate listened with his eyes fixed on his ring “This is very\nserious, very serious,” he said at last. “Perhaps you are right. Perhaps\nM. Ferailleur is innocent. And yet, why should he abscond? why should he\nleave the country?”\n\n“Ah! monsieur, Pascal’s flight is only feigned. He is in\nParis--concealed somewhere--I’m sure of it; and I know a man who will\nfind him for me. Only one thing puzzles me--his silence. To disappear\nwithout a word, without giving me any sign of life----”\n\nThe magistrate interrupted her by a gesture. “I see nothing surprising\nin that since your companion is the Marquis de Valorsay’s spy. How do\nyou know that she has not intercepted or destroyed some letter from M.\nPascal?”\n\nMademoiselle Marguerite turned pale. “Great Heavens! how blind I have\nbeen!” she exclaimed. “I did not think of that. Oh, the wretch! if one\ncould only question her and make her confess her crime. It is horrible\nto think that if I wish to arrive at the truth, I must remain with her\nand treat her in the future just as I have treated her till now.”\n\nBut the magistrate was not the man to wander from the subject he was\ninvestigating. “Let us return to Madame de Fondege,” said he. “She\nis extremely unwilling to see you go out into the world alone.\nWhy?--through affection? No. Why, then? This is what we must ascertain.\nSecondly, she seems indifferent as to whether you accept her hospitality\nor enter a convent.”\n\n“She seems to prefer that I should enter a convent.”\n\n“Very well. What conclusion can we draw from that? Simply, that the\nFondege family don’t particularly care about keeping you with them, or\nmarrying you to their son. If they don’t desire this, it is because they\nare perfectly sure that the missing money was not taken by you. Now, let\nme ask, how can they be so certain? Simply because they know where the\nmissing millions are--and if they know----”\n\n“Ah! monsieur, it is because they’ve stolen them!”\n\nThe magistrate was silent. He had turned the bezel of his ring inside, a\nsure sign of stormy weather, so his clerk would have said--and though he\nhad his features under excellent control he could not entirely conceal\nsome signs of a severe mental conflict he was undergoing. “Well, yes,\nmy child,” he said, at last. “Yes, it is my conviction that the Fondeges\npossess the millions you saw in the count’s escritoire, and which we\nhave been unable to find. How they obtained possession of the money I\ncan’t conceive--but they have it, or else logic is no longer logic.”\n He paused again for a moment, and then he resumed, more slowly: “In\nacquainting you with my opinion on this subject, I have given you, a\nyoung girl, almost a child, a proof of esteem and confidence which,\nit seems to me, few men are worthy of; for I may be deceived, and a\nmagistrate ought not to accuse a person unless he is absolutely certain\nof his guilt. So you must forget what I have just told you, Mademoiselle\nMarguerite.”\n\nShe looked at him with an air of utter astonishment. “You advise me to\nforget,” she murmured, “you wish me to forget.”\n\n“Yes; you must conceal these suspicions in the deepest recesses of your\nheart, until the time comes when you have sufficient proof to convict\nthe culprits. It is true that it will be a difficult task to collect\nsuch proofs; but it is not impossible, with the aid of time, which\ndivulges so many crimes. And you may count upon me; I will give you the\nbenefit of all my influence and experience. It shall never be said that\nI allowed a defenceless girl to be crushed while I saw any chance of\nsaving her.”\n\nTears came to Mademoiselle Marguerite’s eyes. So the world was not\ncomposed entirely of scoundrels! “Ah! how kind you are, monsieur,” she\nsaid; “how kind you are!”\n\n“To be sure!” he interrupted, in a benevolent tone. “But, my child,\nyou must help yourself. Remember this: if the Fondeges suspect our\nsuspicions, all is lost. Repeat this to yourself at every moment in the\nday--and be discreet, impenetrable; for people with unclean consciences\nand hands are always distrustful of others.”\n\nThere was no necessity to say anything more on this point; and so, with\na sudden change of tone he asked: “Have you any plan?”\n\nShe felt that she could, and ought, to confide everything to this\nworthy old man, and so rising to her feet, with a look of energy and\ndetermination on her face, she replied in a firm voice: “My decision\nis taken, monsieur, subject, of course, to your approval. In the first\nplace I shall keep Madame Leon with me, in whatever capacity she likes,\nit doesn’t matter what. Through her I shall no doubt be able to watch\nthe Marquis de Valorsay, and perhaps eventually discover his hopes and\nhis aim. In the second place, I shall accept the hospitality offered me\nby the General and his wife. With them, I shall be in the very centre of\nthe intrigue, and in a position to collect proofs of their infamy.”\n\nThe magistrate gave vent to an exclamation of delight. “You are a brave\ngirl, Mademoiselle Marguerite,” he said, “and at the same time a prudent\none. Yes; that is the proper course to pursue.”\n\nNothing now remained save to make arrangements for her departure. She\npossessed some very handsome diamonds and other costly jewels; should\nshe keep them? “They are undoubtedly mine,” said she; “but after the\ninfamous accusations levelled at me, I can’t consent to take them away\nwith me. They are worth a very handsome amount. I shall leave them with\nyou, monsieur. If the courts restore them to me later--well--I shall\ntake them--and not without pleasure, I frankly confess.” Then as the\nmagistrate questioned her anxiously as to her resources, she replied:\n“Oh! I’m not without money. M. de Chalusse was generosity itself, and my\ntastes are very simple. From the money he gave me for my clothes I saved\nmore than eight thousand francs in less than six months. That is more\nthan sufficient to maintain me for a year.”\n\nThe magistrate then explained that when the court took possession\nof this immense estate, it would surely allow her a certain sum.\nFor whether the count was her father or not, he was at any rate her\nofficially appointed guardian, and she would be considered a minor. And\nin support of his assertion, he quoted Article 367 of the Civil Code,\nwhich says: “In the event of the officially appointed guardian dying\nwithout adopting, his ward, the said ward shall be furnished during her\nminority with the means of subsistence from the said guardian’s estate,”\n etc., etc.\n\n“An additional reason why I should give up my jewels,” said Mademoiselle\nMarguerite.\n\nThe only point that now remained was to decide upon some plan by which\nshe could communicate with her friend, the magistrate, without the\nknowledge of the General or his wife. The magistrate accordingly\nexplained a system of correspondence which would defy the closest\nsurveillance, and then added: “Now, make haste back to your visitor. Who\nknows what suspicions your absence may have caused her?”\n\nBut Mademoiselle Marguerite had one more request to make. She had often\nseen in M. de Chalusse’s possession a little note-book, in which he\nentered the names and addresses of the persons with whom he had business\ntransactions. M. Fortunat’s address must be there, so she asked and\nobtained permission to examine this note-book, and to her great joy,\nunder the letter “F,” she found the entry: “Fortunat (Isidore), No. 28\nPlace de la Bourse.” “Ah! I’m sure that I shall find Pascal now!” she\nexclaimed. And after once more thanking the magistrate, she returned to\nher room again.\n\nMadame de Fondege was awaiting her with feverish impatience. “How long\nyou stayed!” she cried.\n\n“I had so many explanations to give, madame.”\n\n“How you are tormented, my poor child!”\n\n“Oh, shamefully!”\n\nThis furnished Madame de Fondege with another excuse for proffering\nher advice. But Mademoiselle Marguerite would not allow herself to be\nconvinced at once. She raised a great many objections, and parleyed for\na long time before telling Madame de Fondege that she would be happy to\naccept the hospitality which had been offered her. And her consent\nwas by no means unconditional. She insisted on paying her board, and\nexpressed the wish to retain the services of Madame Leon to whom she was\nso much attached. The worthy housekeeper was present at this conference.\nFor an instant she had feared that Mademoiselle Marguerite suspected her\nmanoeuvres but her fears were now dispelled, and she even congratulated\nherself on her skilfulness. Everything was arranged, and the agreement\nhad been sealed with a kiss, when the General returned about four\no’clock. “Ah, my dear!” cried his wife, “what happiness! We have a\ndaughter!”\n\nBut even this intelligence was scarcely sufficient to revive her\nhusband’s drooping spirits. He had almost fainted when he heard the\nearth falling on M. de Chalusse’s coffin; and this display of weakness\non the part of a man adorned with such terrible and ferocious mustaches\nhad excited no little comment. “Yes, it is a great happiness!” he now\nreplied. “But thunder and lightning! I never doubted the dear girl’s\nheart!”\n\nStill both he and his wife could scarcely conceal their disappointment\nwhen the magistrate informed them that their beloved daughter would\nnot take her diamonds. “Dash it!” growled the General. “I recognize her\nfather in this! What delicacy! almost too much, perhaps!”\n\nHowever, when the magistrate informed him that the court would\nundoubtedly order the restitution of the jewels, his face brightened\nagain, and he went down to superintend the removal of Mademoiselle\nMarguerite’s trunks, which were being loaded on one of the vehicles of\nthe establishment.\n\nThen the moment of departure came. Mademoiselle Marguerite acknowledged\nthe parting remarks of the servants, who were secretly delighted to be\nfreed from her presence, and then, before entering the carriage, she\ncast a long, sad look upon this princely mansion which she had once had\nthe right to believe her own, but which she was, alas! now leaving, in\nall probability, for ever.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of this narrative will be found in the volume called\n“Baron Trigault’s Vengeance.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Footnote 1: French gamblers use this expression which they explain by the fact\nthat Charlemagne departed this life with all his possessions intact,\nhaving always added to his dominions without ever experiencing a\nloss.
