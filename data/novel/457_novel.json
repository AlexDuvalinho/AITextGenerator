 "text": "THE PRICE SHE PAID\n\n\nby\n\nDavid Graham Phillips\n\n\n\nI\n\nHENRY GOWER was dead at sixty-one--the end of a lifelong fraud which\nnever had been suspected, and never would be.  With the world, with his\nacquaintances and neighbors, with his wife and son and daughter, he\npassed as a generous, warm-hearted, good-natured man, ready at all\ntimes to do anything to help anybody, incapable of envy or hatred or\nmeanness.  In fact, not once in all his days had he ever thought or\ndone a single thing except for his own comfort.  Like all intensely\nselfish people who are wise, he was cheerful and amiable, because that\nwas the way to be healthy and happy and to have those around one\nagreeable and in the mood to do what one wished them to do.  He told\npeople, not the truth, not the unpleasant thing that might help them,\nbut what they wished to hear.  His family lived in luxurious comfort\nonly because he himself was fond of luxurious comfort. His wife and his\ndaughter dressed fashionably and went about and entertained in the\nfashionable, expensive way only because that was the sort of life that\ngratified his vanity.  He lived to get what he wanted; he got it every\nday and every hour of a life into which no rain ever fell; he died,\nhonored, respected, beloved, and lamented.\n\nThe clever trick he had played upon his fellow beings came very near to\ndiscovery a few days after his death.  His widow and her son and\ndaughter-in-law and daughter were in the living-room of the charming\nhouse at Hanging Rock, near New York, alternating between sorrowings\nover the dead man and plannings for the future.  Said the widow:\n\n\"If Henry had only thought what would become of us if he were taken\naway!\"\n\n\"If he had saved even a small part of what he made every year from the\ntime he was twenty-six--for he always made a big income,\" said his son,\nFrank.\n\n\"But he was so generous, so soft-hearted!\" exclaimed the widow.  \"He\ncould deny us nothing.\"\n\n\"He couldn't bear seeing us with the slightest wish ungratified,\" said\nFrank.\n\n\"He was the best father that ever lived!\" cried the daughter, Mildred.\n\nAnd Mrs. Gower the elder and Mrs. Gower the younger wept; and Mildred\nturned away to hide the emotion distorting her face; and Frank stared\ngloomily at the carpet and sighed.  The hideous secret of the life of\nduplicity was safe, safe forever.\n\nIn fact, Henry Gower had often thought of the fate of his family if he\nshould die.  In the first year of his married life, at a time when\npassion for a beautiful bride was almost sweeping him into generous\nthought, he had listened for upward of an hour to the eloquence of a\nlife insurance agent.  Then the agent, misled by Gower's effusively\ngenerous and unselfish expressions, had taken a false tack.  He had\ndescanted upon the supreme satisfaction that would be felt by a dying\nman as he reflected how his young widow would be left in affluence.  He\nmade a vivid picture; Gower saw--saw his bride happier after his death\nthan she had been during his life, and attracting a swarm of admirers\nby her beauty, well set off in becoming black, and by her independent\nincome.  The generous impulse then and there shriveled to its weak and\nshallow roots.  With tears in his kind, clear eyes he thanked the agent\nand said:\n\n\"You have convinced me.  You need say no more. I'll send for you in a\nfew days.\"\n\nThe agent never got into his presence again. Gower lived up to his\nincome, secure in the knowledge that his ability as a lawyer made him\ncertain of plenty of money as long as he should live.  But it would\nshow an utter lack of comprehension of his peculiar species of\ncharacter to imagine that he let himself into the secret of his own\nicy-heartedness by ceasing to think of the problem of his wife and two\nchildren without him to take care of them.  On the contrary, he thought\nof it every day, and planned what he would do about it--to-morrow.  And\nfor his delay he had excellent convincing excuses.  Did he not take\ncare of his naturally robust health?  Would he not certainly outlive\nhis wife, who was always doctoring more or less? Frank would be able to\ntake care of himself; anyhow, it was not well to bring a boy up to\nexpectations, because every man should be self-supporting and\nself-reliant.  As for Mildred, why, with her beauty and her cleverness\nshe could not but make a brilliant marriage. Really, there was for him\nno problem of an orphaned family's future; there was no reason why he\nshould deny himself any comfort or luxury, or his vanity any of the\ntitillations that come from social display.\n\nThat one of his calculations which was the most vital and seemed the\nsurest proved to be worthless.  It is not the weaklings who die, after\ninfancy and youth, but the strong, healthy men and women.  The\nweaklings have to look out for themselves, receive ample warning in the\ndisastrous obvious effects of the slightest imprudence.  The robust,\neven the wariest of them, even the Henry Gowers, overestimate and\novertax their strength.  Gower's downfall was champagne.  He could not\nresist a bottle of it for dinner every night. As so often happens, the\ncollapse of the kidneys came without any warning that a man of powerful\nconstitution would deem worthy of notice.  By the time the doctor began\nto suspect the gravity of his trouble he was too far gone.\n\nFrank, candidly greedy and selfish--\"Such a contrast to his father!\"\neveryone said--was married to the prettiest girl in Hanging Rock and\nhad a satisfactory law practice in New York.  His income was about\nfifteen thousand a year.  But his wife had tastes as extravagant as his\nown; and Hanging Rock is one of those suburbs of New York where gather\nwell-to-do middle-class people to live luxuriously and to delude each\nother and themselves with the notion that they are fashionable, rich\nNew Yorkers who prefer to live in the country \"like the English.\" Thus,\nHenry Gower's widow and daughter could count on little help from\nFrank--and they knew it.\n\n\"You and Milly will have to move to some less expensive place than\nHanging Rock,\" said Frank--it was the living-room conference a few days\nafter the funeral.\n\nMildred flushed and her eyes flashed.  She opened her lips to\nspeak--closed them again with the angry retort unuttered.  After all,\nFrank was her mother's and her sole dependence.  They could hope for\nlittle from him, but nothing must be said that would give him and his\nmean, selfish wife a chance to break with them and refuse to do\nanything whatever.\n\n\"And Mildred must get married,\" said Natalie. In Hanging Rock most of\nthe girls and many of the boys had given names taken from Burke's\nPeerage, the Almanac de Gotha, and fashionable novels.\n\nAgain Mildred flushed; but her eyes did not flash, neither did she open\nher lips to speak.  The little remark of her sister-in-law, apparently\nso harmless and sensible, was in fact a poisoned arrow.  For Mildred\nwas twenty-three, had been \"out\" five years, and was not even in the\nway to become engaged.  She and everyone had assumed from her lovely\nbabyhood that she would marry splendidly, would marry wealth and social\nposition.  How could it be otherwise?  Had she not beauty?  Had she not\nfamily and position?  Had she not style and cleverness?  Yet--five\nyears out and not a \"serious\" proposal.  An impudent poor fellow with\nno prospects had asked her.  An impudent rich man from fashionable New\nYork had hung after her--and had presently abandoned whatever dark\nprojects he may have been concealing and had married in his own set,\n\"as they always do, the miserable snobs,\" raved Mrs. Gower, who had\nbeen building high upon those lavish outpourings of candy, flowers, and\nautomobile rides.  Mildred, however, had accepted the defection more\nphilosophically.  She had had enough vanity to like the attentions of\nthe rich and fashionable New Yorker, enough good sense to suspect,\nperhaps not definitely, what those attentions meant, but certainly what\nthey did not mean.  Also, in the back of her head had been an intention\nto refuse Stanley Baird, if by chance he should ask her.  Was there any\nsubstance to this intention, sprung from her disliking the conceited,\nself-assured snob as much as she liked his wealth and station?  Perhaps\nnot.  Who can say?  At any rate, may we not claim credit for our good\nintentions--so long as, even through lack of opportunity, we have not\nstultified them?\n\nWith every natural advantage apparently, Mildred's failure to catch a\nhusband seemed to be somehow her own fault.  Other girls, less endowed\nthan she, were marrying, were marrying fairly well.  Why, then, was\nMildred lagging in the market?\n\nThere may have been other reasons, reasons of accident--for, in the\nhigher class matrimonial market, few are called and fewer chosen. There\nwas one reason not accidental; Hanging Rock was no place for a girl so\nsuperior as was Mildred Gower to find a fitting husband.  As has been\nhinted, Hanging Rock was one of those upper-middle-class colonies where\nsplurge and social ambition dominate the community life. In such\ncolonies the young men are of two classes--those beneath such a girl as\nMildred, and those who had the looks, the manners, the intelligence,\nand the prospects to justify them in looking higher socially--in\nlooking among the very rich and really fashionable.  In the Hanging\nRock sort of community, having all the snobbishness of Fifth Avenue,\nBack Bay, and Rittenhouse Square, with the added torment of the\nsnobbishness being perpetually ungratified--in such communities,\nbeneath a surface reeking culture and idealistic folderol, there is a\ncoarse and brutal materialism, a passion for money, for luxury, for\ndisplay, that equals aristocratic societies at their worst.  No one can\nlive for a winter, much less grow up, in such a place without becoming\nsaturated with sycophantry.  Thus, only by some impossible combination\nof chances could there have been at Hanging Rock a young man who would\nhave appreciated Mildred and have had the courage of his appreciation.\nThis combination did not happen. In Mildred's generation and set there\nwere only the two classes of men noted above.  The men of the one of\nthem which could not have attracted her accepted their fate of mating\nwith second-choice females to whom they were themselves second choice.\nThe men of the other class rarely appeared at Hanging Rock functions,\nhung about the rich people in New York, Newport, and on Long Island,\nand would as soon have thought of taking a Hanging Rock society girl to\nwife as of exchanging hundred-dollar bills for twenty-five-cent pieces.\nHaving attractions acceptable in the best markets, they took them\nthere.  Hanging Rock denounced them as snobs, for Hanging Rock was\nvirtuously eloquent on the subject of snobbishness--we human creatures\nbeing never so effective as when assailing in others the vice or\nweakness we know from lifelong, intimate, internal association with it.\nBut secretly the successfully ambitious spurners of that suburban\nsociety were approved, were envied.  And Hanging Rock was most gracious\nto them whenever it got the chance.\n\nIn her five years of social life Mildred had gone only with the various\nclasses of fashionable people, had therefore known only the men who are\nfull of the poison of snobbishness.  She had been born and bred in an\nenvironment as impregnated with that poison as the air of a\nkitchen-garden with onions.  She knew nothing else.  The secret\nintention to refuse Stanley Baird, should he propose, was therefore the\nmore astonishing--and the more significant.  From time to time in any\ngiven environment you will find some isolated person, some personality,\nwith a trait wholly foreign and out of place there.  Now it is a soft\nvoice and courteous manners in a slum; again it is a longing for a life\nof freedom and equality in a member of a royal family that has known\nnothing but sordid slavery for centuries.  Or, in the petty\nconventionality of a prosperous middle- or upper-class community you\ncome upon one who dreams--perhaps vaguely but still longingly--of an\nexistence where love and ideas shall elevate and glorify life.  In\nspite of her training, in spite of the teaching and example of all\nabout her from the moment of her opening her eyes upon the world,\nMildred Gower at twenty-three still retained something of these dream\nflowers sown in the soil of her naturally good mind by some book or\nplay or perhaps by some casually read and soon forgotten article in\nmagazine or newspaper.  We have the habit of thinking only weeds\nproduce seeds that penetrate and prosper everywhere and anywhere.  The\ntruth is that fine plants of all kinds, vegetable, fruit, and flower of\nrarest color and perfume, have this same hardiness and fecundity.  Pull\naway at the weeds in your garden for a while, and see if this is not\nso.  Though you may plant nothing, you will be amazed at the results if\nyou but clear a little space of its weeds--which you have been planting\nand cultivating.\n\nMildred--woman fashion--regarded it as a reproach upon her that she had\nnot yet succeeded in making the marriage everyone, including herself,\npredicted for her and expected of her.  On the contrary, it was the\nmost savage indictment possible of the marriageable and marrying men\nwho had met her--of their stupidity, of their short-sighted and\nmean-souled calculation, of their lack of courage--the courage to take\nwhat they, as men of flesh and blood wanted, instead of what their\nsnobbishness ordered.  And if Stanley Baird, the nearest to a\nflesh-and-blood man of any who had known her, had not been so\nprofoundly afraid of his fashionable mother and of his sister, the\nCountess of Waring--  But he was profoundly afraid of them; so, it is\nidle to speculate about him.\n\nWhat did men see when they looked at Mildred Gower?  Usually, when men\nlook at a woman, they have a hazy, either pleasant or unpleasant, sense\nof something feminine.  That, and nothing more.  Afterward, through\nsome whim or some thrust from chance they may see in her, or fancy they\nsee in her, the thing feminine that their souls--it is always\n\"soul\"--most yearns after.  But just at first glance, so colorless or\nconventionally colored is the usual human being, the average\nwoman--indeed every woman but she who is exceptional--creates upon man\nthe mere impression of pleasant or unpleasant petticoats.  In the\nexceptional woman something obtrudes.  She has astonishing hair, or\nextraordinary eyes, or a mouth that seems to draw a man like a magnet;\nor it is the allure of a peculiar smile or of a figure whose\nsinuosities as she moves seem to cause a corresponding wave-disturbance\nin masculine nerves.  Further, the possession of one of these signal\ncharms usually causes all her charms to have more than ordinary\npotency.  The sight of the man is so bewitched by the one potent charm\nthat he sees the whole woman under a spell.\n\nMildred Gower, of the medium height and of a slender and well-formed\nfigure, had a face of the kind that is called lovely; and her smile,\nsweet, dreamy, revealing white and even teeth, gave her loveliness\ndelicate animation.  She had an abundance of hair, neither light nor\ndark; she had a fine clear skin.  Her eyes, gray and rather serious and\nwell set under long straight brows, gave her a look of honesty and\nintelligence. But the charm that won men, her charm of charms, was her\nmouth--mobile, slightly pouted, not too narrow, of a wonderful, vividly\nhealthy and vital red.  She had beauty, she had intelligence.  But it\nwas impossible for a man to think of either, once his glance had been\ncaught by those expressive, inviting lips of hers, so young, so fresh,\nwith their ever-changing, ever-fascinating line expressing in a\nthousand ways the passion and poetry of the kiss.\n\nOf all the men who had admired her and had edged away because they\nfeared she would bewitch them into forgetting what the world calls\n\"good common sense\"--of all those men only one had suspected the real\nreason for her physical power over men.  All but Stanley Baird had\nthought themselves attracted because she was so pretty or so stylish or\nso clever and amusing to talk with.  Baird had lived intelligently\nenough to learn that feminine charm is never general, is always\nspecific.  He knew it was Mildred Gower's lips that haunted, that\nfrightened ambitious men away, that sent men who knew they hadn't a\nghost of a chance with her discontentedly back to the second-choice\nwomen who alone were available for them.  Fortunately for Mildred,\nStanley Baird, too wise to flatter a woman discriminatingly, did not\ntell her the secret of her fascination.  If he had told her, she would\nno doubt have tried to train and to use it--and so would inevitably\nhave lost it.\n\nTo go on with that important conference in the sitting-room in the\nhandsome, roomy house of the Gowers at Hanging Rock, Frank Gower\neagerly seized upon his wife's subtly nasty remark.  \"I don't see why\nin thunder you haven't married, Milly,\" said he.  \"You've had every\nchance, these last four or five years.\"\n\n\"And it'll be harder now,\" moaned her mother. \"For it looks as though\nwe were going to be wretchedly poor.  And poverty is so repulsive.\"\n\n\"Do you think,\" said Mildred, \"that giving me the idea that I must\nmarry right away will make it easier for me to marry?  Everyone who\nknows us knows our circumstances.\"  She looked significantly at Frank's\nwife, who had been wailing through Hanging Rock the woeful plight of\nher dead father-in-law's family. The young Mrs. Gower blushed and\nglanced away. \"And,\" Mildred went on, \"everyone is saying that I must\nmarry at once--that there's nothing else for me to do.\"  She smiled\nbitterly.  \"When I go into the street again I shall see nothing but\nflying men.  And no man would come to call unless he brought a chaperon\nand a witness with him.\"\n\n\"How can you be so frivolous?\" reproached her mother.\n\nMildred was used to being misunderstood by her mother, who had long\nsince been made hopelessly dull by the suffocating life she led and by\npain from her feet, which never left her at ease for a moment except\nwhen she had them soaking in cold water.  Mrs. Gower had been born with\nordinary feet, neither ugly nor pretty and entirely fit for the uses\nfor which nature intended feet.  She had spoiled them by wearing shoes\nto make them look smaller and slimmer than they were. In steady weather\nshe was plaintive; in changeable weather she varied between irritable\nand violent.\n\nSaid Mildred to her brother:  \"How much--JUST how much is there?\"\n\n\"I can't say exactly,\" replied her brother, who had not yet solved to\nhis satisfaction the moral problem of how much of the estate he ought\nto allow his mother and sister and how much he ought to claim for\nhimself--in such a way that the claim could not be disputed.\n\nMildred looked fixedly at him.  He showed his uneasiness not by\nglancing away, but by the appearance of a certain hard defiance in his\neyes.  Said she:\n\n\"What is the very most we can hope for?\"\n\nA silence.  Her mother broke it.  \"Mildred, how CAN you talk of those\nthings--already?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Mildred.  \"Perhaps because it's got to be done.\"\n\nThis seemed to them all--and to herself--a lame excuse for such\napparent hardness of heart.  Her father had always been\nSENDER-HEARTED--HAD NEVER SPOKEN OF MONEY, OR ENCOURAGED HIS FAMILY IN\nSPEAKING OF IT.\n\nA LONG AND PAINFUL SILENCE.  THEN, THE WIDOW ABRUPTLY:\n\n\"YOU'RE SURE, Frank, there's NO insurance?\"\n\n\"Father always said that you disliked the idea,\" replied her son; \"that\nyou thought insurance looked like your calculating on his death.\"\n\nUnder her husband's adroit prompting Mrs. Gower had discovered such a\nview of insurance in her brain. She now recalled expressing it--and\nregretted.  But she was silenced.  She tried to take her mind of the\nsubject of money.  But, like Mildred, she could not.  The thought of\nimminent poverty was nagging at them like toothache.  \"There'll be\nenough for a year or so?\" she said, timidly interrogative.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Frank.\n\nMildred was eying him fixedly again.  Said she: \"Have you found\nanything at all?\"\n\n\"He had about eight thousand dollars in bank,\" said Frank.  \"But most\nof it will go for the pressing debts.\"\n\n\"But how did HE expect to live?\" urged Mildred.\n\n\"Yes, there must have been SOMETHING,\" said her mother.\n\n\"Of course, there's his share of the unsettled and unfinished business\nof the firm,\" admitted Frank.\n\n\"How much will that be?\" persisted Mildred.\n\n\"I can't tell, offhand,\" said Frank, with virtuous reproach.  \"My\nmind's been on--other things.\"\n\nHenry Gower's widow was not without her share of instinctive\nshrewdness.  Neither had she, unobservant though she was, been within\nsight of her son's character for twenty-eight years without having\nunconfessed, unformed misgivings concerning it. \"You mustn't bother\nabout these things now, Frank dear,\" said she.  \"I'll get my brother to\nlook into it.\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary,\" hastily said Frank.  \"I don't want any rival\nlawyer peeping into our firm's affairs.\"\n\n\"My brother Wharton is the soul of honor,\" said Mrs. Gower, the elder,\nwith dignity.  \"You are too young to take all the responsibility of\nsettling the estate.  Yes, I'll send for Wharton to-morrow.\"\n\n\"It'll look as though you didn't trust me,\" said Frank sourly.\n\n\"We mustn't do anything to start the gossips in this town,\" said his\nwife, assisting.\n\n\"Then send for him yourself, Frank,\" said Mildred, \"and give him charge\nof the whole matter.\"\n\nFrank eyed her furiously.  \"How ashamed father would be!\" exclaimed he.\n\nBut this solemn invoking of the dead man's spirit was uneffectual.  The\nspecter of poverty was too insistent, too terrible.  Said the widow:\n\n\"I'm sure, in the circumstances, my dear dead husband would want me to\nget help from someone older and more experienced.\"\n\nAnd Frank, guilty of conscience and an expert in the ways of\nconventional and highly moral rascality, ceased to resist.  His wife,\nscenting danger to their getting the share that \"rightfully belongs to\nthe son, especially when he has been the brains of the firm for several\nyears,\" made angry and indiscreet battle for no outside interference.\nThe longer she talked the firmer the widow and the daughter became, not\nonly because she clarified suspicions that had been too hazy to take\nform, but also because they disliked her intensely. The following day\nWharton Conover became unofficial administrator.  He had no difficulty\nin baffling Frank Gower's half-hearted and clumsy efforts to hide two\nlarge fees due the dead man's estate.  He discovered clear assets\namounting in all to sixty-three thousand dollars, most of it available\nwithin a few months.\n\n\"As you have the good-will of the firm and as your mother and sister\nhave only what can be realized in cash,\" said he to Frank, \"no doubt\nyou won't insist on your third.\"\n\n\"I've got to consider my wife,\" said Frank.  \"I can't do as I'd like.\"\n\n\"You are going to insist on your third?\" said Conover, with an accent\nthat made Frank quiver.\n\n\"I can't do otherwise,\" said he in a dogged, shamed way.\n\n\"Um,\" said Conover.  \"Then, on behalf of my sister and her daughter\nI'll have to insist on a more detailed accounting than you have been\nwilling to give--and on the production of that small book bound in red\nleather which disappeared from my brother-in-law's desk the afternoon\nof his death.\"\n\nA wave of rage and fear surged up within Frank Gower and crashed\nagainst the seat of his life.  For days thereafter he was from time to\ntime seized with violent spasms of trembling; years afterward he was\nattributing premature weaknesses of old age to the effects of that\nmoment of horror.  His uncle's words came as a sudden, high shot climax\nto weeks of exasperating peeping and prying and questioning, of sneer\nand insinuation.  Conover had been only moderately successful at the\nlaw, had lost clients to Frank's father, had been beaten when they were\non opposite sides.  He hated the father with the secret, hypocritical\nhatred of the highly moral and religious man.  He despised the son. It\nis not often that a Christian gentleman has such an opportunity to\ncombine justice and revenge, to feed to bursting an ancient grudge, the\nwhile conscious that he is but doing his duty.\n\nSaid Frank, when he was able to speak:  \"You have been listening to the\nlies of some treacherous clerk here.\"\n\n\"Don't destroy that little book,\" proceeded Conover tranquilly.  \"We\ncan prove that you took it.\"\n\nYoung Gower rose.  \"I must decline to have anything further to say to\nyou, sir,\" said he.  \"You will leave this office, and you will not be\nadmitted here again unless you come with proper papers as\nadministrator.\"\n\nConover smiled with cold satisfaction and departed. There followed a\nseries of quarrels--between Frank and his sister, between Frank and his\nmother, between Frank's wife and his mother, between Mildred and her\nmother, between the mother and Conover.  Mrs. Gower was suspicious of\nher son; but she knew her brother for a pinchpenny, exacting the last\ndrop of what he regarded as his own.  And she discovered that, if she\nauthorized him to act as administrator for her, he could--and beyond\nquestion would--take a large share of the estate.  The upshot was that\nFrank paid over to his mother and sister forty-seven thousand dollars,\nand his mother and her brother stopped speaking to each other.\n\n\"I see that you have turned over all your money to mother,\" said Frank\nto Mildred a few days after the settlement.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mildred.  She was in a mood of high scorn for\nsordidness--a mood induced by the spectacle of the shameful manners of\nConover, Frank, and his wife.\n\n\"Do you think that's wise?\" suggested Frank.\n\n\"I think it's decent,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Well, I hope you'll not live to regret it,\" said her brother.\n\nNeither Mrs. Gower nor her daughter had ever had any experience in the\ncare of money.  To both forty-seven thousand dollars seemed a\nfortune--forty-seven thousand dollars in cash in the bank, ready to\nissue forth and do their bidding at the mere writing of a few figures\nand a signature on a piece of paper.  In a sense they knew that for\nmany years the family's annual expenses had ranged between forty and\nfifty thousand, but in the sense of actuality they knew nothing about\nit--a state of affairs common enough in families where the man is in\nabsolute control and spends all he makes.  Money always had been\nforthcoming; therefore money always would be forthcoming.\n\nThe mourning and the loss of the person who had filled and employed\ntheir lives caused the widow and the daughter to live very quietly\nduring the succeeding year.  They spent only half of their capital. For\nreasons of selfish and far-sighted prudence which need no detailing\nFrank moved away to New York within six months of his father's death\nand reduced communication between himself and wife and his mother and\nsister to a frigid and rapidly congealing minimum. He calculated that\nby the time their capital was consumed they would have left no feeling\nof claim upon him or he feeling of duty toward them.\n\nIt was not until eighteen months after her father's death, when the\ntotal capital was sunk to less than fifteen thousand dollars, that\nMildred awakened to the truth of their plight.  A few months at most,\nand they would have to give up that beautiful house which had been her\nhome all her life.  She tried to grasp the meaning of the facts as her\nintelligence presented them to her, but she could not.  She had no\npractical training whatever.  She had been brought up as a rich man's\nchild, to be married to a rich man, and never to know anything of the\nmaterial details of life beyond what was necessary in managing servants\nafter the indifferent fashion of the usual American woman of the\ncomfortable classes.  She had always had a maid; she could not even\ndress herself properly without the maid's assistance.  Life without a\nmaid was inconceivable; life without servants was impossible.\n\nShe wandered through the house, through the grounds.  She said to\nherself again and again:  \"We have got to give up all this, and be\nmiserably poor--with not a servant, with less than the tenement people\nhave.\"  But the words conveyed no meaning to her. She said to herself\nagain and again:  \"I must rouse myself.  I must do something.  I\nmust--must--must!\"  But she did not rouse, because there was nothing to\nrouse.  So far as practical life was concerned she was as devoid of\nideas as a new-born baby.\n\nThere was but the one hope--marriage, a rich marriage.  It is the habit\nof men who can take care of themselves and of women who are securely\nwell taken care of to scorn the woman or the helpless-bred man who\nmarries for money or even entertains that idea. How little imagination\nthese scorners have!  To marry for a mere living, hardly better than\none could make for oneself, assuredly does show a pitiful lack of\nself-reliance, a melancholy lack of self-respect.  But for men or women\nall their lives used to luxury and with no ability whatever at earning\nmoney--for such persons to marry money in order to save themselves from\nthe misery and shame that poverty means to them is the most natural,\nthe most human action conceivable.  The man or the woman who says he or\nshe would not do it, either is a hypocrite or is talking without\nthinking. You may in honesty criticize and condemn a social system that\nsuffers men and women to be so crudely and criminally miseducated by\nbeing given luxury they did not earn.  But to condemn the victims of\nthat system for acting as its logic compels is sheer folly or sheer\nphariseeism.\n\nWould Mildred Gower have married for money?  As the weeks fled, as the\nbank account dwindled, she would have grasped eagerly at any rich man\nwho might have offered himself--no matter how repellent he might have\nbeen.  She did not want a bare living; she did not want what passes\nwith the mass of middle-class people for comfort.  She wanted what she\nhad--the beautiful and spacious house, the costly and fashionable\nclothing, the servants, the carriages and motors, the thousand and one\ncomforts, luxuries, and vanities to which she had always been used.  In\nthe brain of a young woman of poor or only comfortably off family the\nthoughts that seethed in Mildred Gower's brain would have been so many\nindications of depravity.  In Mildred Gower's brain they were the\nnatural, the inevitable, thoughts. They indicated everything as to her\ntraining, nothing as to her character.  So, when she, thinking only of\na rich marriage with no matter whom, and contrasting herself with the\nfine women portrayed in the novels and plays, condemned herself as\nshameless and degraded, she did herself grave injustice.\n\nBut no rich man, whether attractive or repulsive, offered.  Indeed, no\nman of any kind offered.  Instead, it was her mother who married.\n\nA widower named James Presbury, elderly, with an income of five to six\nthousand a year from inherited wealth, stumbled into Hanging Rock to\nlive, was impressed by the style the widow Gower maintained, believed\nthe rumor that her husband had left her better off than was generally\nthought, proposed, and was accepted.  And two years and a month after\nHenry Gower's death his widow became Mrs. James Presbury--and ceased to\nveil from her new husband the truth as to her affairs.\n\nMildred had thought that, than the family quarrels incident to settling\nher father's estate, human nature could no lower descend.  She was now\nto be disillusioned. When a young man or a young woman blunders into a\npoor marriage in trying to make a rich one, he or she is usually\nwithheld from immediate and frank expression by the timidity of youth.\nNot so the elderly man or woman.  As we grow older, no matter how\ntimidly conventional we are by nature, we become, through selfishness\nor through indifference to the opinion of others or through impatience\nof petty restraint, more and more outspoken.  Old Presbury discovered\nhow he had tricked himself four days after the wedding.  He and his\nbride were at the Waldorf in New York, a-honeymooning.\n\nThe bride had never professed to be rich.  She had simply continued in\nher lifelong way, had simply acted rich.  She well knew the gaudy\ndelusions her admirer was entertaining, and she saw to it that nothing\nwas said or done to disturb him.  She inquired into his affairs, made\nsure of the substantiality of the comparatively small income he\npossessed, decided to accept him as her best available chance to escape\nbecoming a charge upon her anything but eager and generous relatives.\nShe awaited the explosion with serenity. She cared not a flip for\nPresbury, who was a soft and silly old fool, full of antiquated\ncompliments and so drearily the inferior of Henry Gower, physically and\nmentally, that even she could appreciate the difference, the descent.\nShe rather enjoyed the prospect of a combat with him, of the end of\ndissimulating her contempt.  She had thought out and had put in arsenal\nready for use a variety of sneers, jeers, and insults that suggested\nthemselves to her as she listened and simpered and responded while he\nwas courting.\n\nHad the opportunity offered earlier than the fourth day she would have\nseized it, but not until that fourth morning was she in just the right\nmood.  She had eaten too much dinner the night before, and had followed\nit after two hours in a stuffy theater with an indigestible supper.  He\nliked the bedroom windows open at night; she liked them closed.  After\nshe fell into a heavy sleep, he slipped out of bed and opened the\nwindows wide--to teach her by the night's happy experience that she was\nentirely mistaken as to the harmfulness of fresh winter air.  The\nresult was that she awakened with a frightful cold and a splitting\nheadache.  And as the weather was about to change she had shooting\npains like toothache through her toes the instant she thrust them into\nher shoes. The elderly groom, believing he had a rich bride, was all\nsolicitude and infuriating attention.  She waited until he had wrought\nher to the proper pitch of fury.  Then she said--in reply to some\nremark of his:\n\n\"Yes, I shall rely upon you entirely.  I want you to take absolute\ncharge of my affairs.\"\n\nThe tears sprang to his eyes.  His weak old mouth, rapidly falling to\npieces, twisted and twitched with emotion.  \"I'll try to deserve your\nconfidence, darling,\" said he.  \"I've had large business experience--in\nthe way of investing carefully, I mean.  I don't think your affairs\nwill suffer in my hands.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure they'll not trouble you,\" said she in a sweet, sure tone\nas the pains shot through her feet and her head.  \"You'll hardly notice\nmy little mite in your property.\"  She pretended to reflect.  \"Let me\nsee--there's seven thousand left, but of course half of that is\nMillie's.\"\n\n\"It must be very well invested,\" said he.  \"Those seven thousand shares\nmust be of the very best.\"\n\n\"Shares?\" said she, with a gentle little laugh.  \"I mean dollars.\"\n\nPresbury was about to lift a cup of cafe au lait to his lips.  Instead,\nhe turned it over into the platter of eggs and bacon.\n\n\"We--Mildred and I,\" pursued his bride, \"were left with only forty-odd\nthousand between us.  Of course, we had to live.  So, naturally,\nthere's very little left.\"\n\nPresbury was shaking so violently that his head and arms waggled like a\njumping-jack's.  He wrapped his elegant white fingers about the arms of\nhis chair to steady himself.  In a suffocated voice he said:  \"Do you\nmean to say that you have only seven thousand dollars in the world?\"\n\n\"Only half that,\" corrected she.  \"Oh, dear, how my head aches!  Less\nthan half that, for there are some debts.\"\n\nShe was impatient for the explosion; the agony of her feet and head\nneeded outlet and relief.  But he disappointed her.  That was one of\nthe situations in which one appeals in vain to the resources of\nlanguage.  He shrank and sank back in his chair, his jaw dropped, and\nhe vented a strange, imbecile cackling laugh.  It was not an expression\nof philosophic mirth, of sense of the grotesqueness of an anti-climax.\nIt was not an expression of any emotion whatever.  It was simply a\nsignal from a mind temporarily dethroned.\n\n\"What are you laughing at?\" she said sharply.\n\nHis answer was a repetition of the idiotic sound.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" demanded she. \"Please close your mouth.\"\n\nIt was a timely piece of advice; for his upper and false teeth had\nbecome partially dislodged and threatened to drop upon the shirt-bosom\ngayly showing between the lapels of his dark-blue silk house-coat.  He\nslowly closed his mouth, moving his teeth back into place with his\ntongue--a gesture that made her face twitch with rage and disgust.\n\n\"Seven thousand dollars,\" he mumbled dazedly.\n\n\"I said less than half that,\" retorted she sharply.\n\n\"And I--thought you were--rich.\"\n\nA peculiar rolling of the eyes and twisting of the lips gave her the\nidea that he was about to vent that repulsive sound again.  \"Don't you\nlaugh!\" she cried. \"I can't bear your laugh--even at its best.\"\n\nSuddenly he galvanized into fury.  \"This is an outrage!\" he cried,\nwaving his useless-looking white fists. \"You have swindled me--SWINDLED\nme!\"\n\nHer head stopped aching.  The pains in her feet either ceased or she\nforgot them.  In a suspiciously calm voice she said:  \"What do you\nmean?\"\n\n\"I mean that you are a swindler!\" he shouted, banging one fist on the\ntable and waving the other.\n\nShe acted as though his meaning were just dawning upon her.  \"Do you\nmean,\" said she tranquilly, \"that you married me for money?\"\n\n\"I mean that I thought you a substantial woman, and that I find you are\nan adventuress.\"\n\n\"Did you think,\" inquired she, \"that any woman who had money would\nmarry YOU?\" She laughed very quietly.  \"You ARE a fool!\"\n\nHe sat back to look at her.  This mode of combat in such circumstances\npuzzled him.\n\n\"I knew that you were rich,\" she went on, \"or you would not have dared\noffer yourself to me.  All my friends were amazed at my stooping to\naccept you. Your father was an Irish Tammany contractor, wasn't he?--a\nsort of criminal?  But I simply had to marry. So I gave you my family\nand position and name in exchange for your wealth--a good bargain for\nyou, but a poor one for me.\"\n\nThese references to HIS wealth were most disconcerting, especially as\nthey were accompanied by remarks about his origin, of which he was so\nashamed that he had changed the spelling of his name in the effort to\nclear himself of it.  However, some retort was imperative. He looked at\nher and said:\n\n\"Swindler and adventuress!\"\n\n\"Don't repeat that lie,\" said she.  \"You are the adventurer--despite\nthe fact that you are very rich.\"\n\n\"Don't say that again,\" cried he.  \"I never said or pretended I was\nrich.  I have about five thousand a year--and you'll not get a cent of\nit, madam!\"\n\nShe knew his income, but no one would have suspected it from her\nexpression of horror.  \"What!\" she gasped.  \"You dared to marry ME when\nyou were a--beggar!  Me--the widow of Henry Gower!  You impudent old\nwreck!  Why, you haven't enough to pay my servants.  What are we to\nlive on, pray?\"\n\n\"I don't know what YOU'LL live on,\" replied he. \"_I_ shall live as I\nalways have.\"\n\n\"A beggar!\" she exclaimed.  \"I--married to a beggar.\"  She burst into\ntears.  \"How men take advantage of a woman alone!  If my son had been\nnear me!  But there's surely some law to protect me.  Yes, I'm sure\nthere is.  Oh, I'll punish you for having deceived me.\"  Her eyes dried\nas she looked at him. \"How dare you sit there?  How dare you face me,\nyou miserable fraud!\"\n\nEarly in her acquaintance with him she had discovered that determining\nfactors in his character were sensitiveness about his origin and\nsensitiveness about his social position.  On this knowledge of his\nweaknesses was securely based her confidence that she could act as she\npleased toward him.  To ease her pains she proceeded to pour out her\nprivate opinion of him--all the disagreeable things, all the insults\nshe had been storing up.\n\nShe watched him as only a woman can watch a man. She saw that his rage\nwas not dangerous, that she was forcing him into a position where fear\nof her revenging herself by disgracing him would overcome anger at the\ncollapse of his fatuous dreams of wealth.  She did not despise him the\nmore deeply for sitting there, for not flying from the room or trying\nto kill her or somehow compelling her to check that flow of insult. She\nalready despised him utterly; also, she attached small importance to\nself-respect, having no knowledge of what that quality really is.\n\nWhen she grew tired, she became quiet.  They sat there a long time in\nsilence.  At last he ran up the white flag of abject surrender by\nsaying:\n\n\"What'll we live on--that's what I'd like to know?\"\n\nAn eavesdropper upon the preceding violence of upward of an hour would\nhave assumed that at its end this pair must separate, never to see each\nother again voluntarily.  But that idea, even as a possibility, had not\nentered the mind of either.  They had lived a long time; they were\npractical people.  They knew from the outset that somehow they must\narrange to go on together. The alternative meant a mere pittance of\nalimony for her; meant for him social ostracism and the small income\ncut in half; meant for both scandal and confusion.\n\nSaid she fretfully:  \"Oh, I suppose we'll get along, somehow.  I don't\nknow anything about those things. I've always been looked after--kept\nfrom contact with the sordid side of life.\"\n\n\"That house you live in,\" he went on, \"does it belong to you?\"\n\nShe gave him a contemptuous glance.  \"Of course,\" said she.  \"What low\npeople you must have been used to!\"\n\n\"I thought perhaps you had rented it for your bunco game,\" retorted he.\n\"The furniture, the horses, the motor--all those things--do they belong\nto you?\"\n\n\"I shall leave the room if you insult me,\" said she.\n\n\"Did you include them in the seven thousand dollars?\"\n\n\"The money is in the bank.  It has nothing to do with our house and our\nproperty.\"\n\nHe reflected, presently said:  \"The horses and carriages must be sold\nat once--and all those servants dismissed except perhaps two.  We can\nlive in the house.\"\n\nShe grew purple with rage.  \"Sell MY carriages! Discharge MY servants!\nI'd like to see you try!\"\n\n\"Who's to pay for keeping up that establishment?\" demanded he.\n\nShe was silent.  She saw what he had in mind.\n\n\"If you want to keep that house and live comfortably,\" he went on,\n\"you've got to cut expenses to the bone.  You see that, don't you?\"\n\n\"I can't live any way but the way I've been used to all my life,\"\nwailed she.\n\nHe eyed her disgustedly.  Was there anything equal to a woman for folly?\n\n\"We've got to make the most of what little we have,\" said he.\n\n\"I tell you I don't know anything about those things,\" repeated she.\n\"You'll have to look after them. Mildred and I aren't like the women\nyou've been used to. We are ladies.\"\n\nPresbury's rage boiled over again at the mention of Mildred.  \"That\ndaughter of yours!\" he cried. \"What's to be done about her?  I've got\nno money to waste on her.\"\n\n\"You miserable Tammany THING!\" exclaimed she. \"Don't you dare SPEAK of\nmy daughter except in the most respectful way.\"\n\nAnd once more she opened out upon him, wreaking upon him all her wrath\nagainst fate, all the pent-up fury of two years--fury which had been\ndenied such fury's usual and natural expression in denunciations of the\ndead bread-winner.  The generous and ever-kind Henry Gower could not be\nto blame for her wretched plight; and, of course, she herself could not\nbe to blame for it.  So, until now there had been no scapegoat.\nPresbury therefore received the whole burden.  He, alarmed lest a\ncreature apparently so irrational, should in wild rage drive him away,\nruin him socially, perhaps induce a sympathetic court to award her a\nlarge part of his income as alimony, said not a word in reply.  He bade\nhis wrath wait.  Later on, when the peril was over, when he had a firm\ngrip upon the situation--then he would take his revenge.\n\nThey gave up the expensive suite at the Waldorf that very day and\nreturned to Hanging Rock.  They alternated between silence and the\ncoarsest, crudest quarrelings, for neither had the intelligence to\nquarrel wittily or the refinement to quarrel artistically.  As soon as\nthey arrived at the Gower house, Mildred was dragged into the wrangle.\n\n\"I married this terrible man for your sake,\" was the burden of her\nmother's wail.  \"And he is a beggar--wants to sell off everything and\ndismiss the servants.\"\n\n\"You are a pair of paupers,\" cried the old man. \"You are shameless\ntricksters.  Be careful how you goad me!\"\n\nMildred had anticipated an unhappy ending to her mother's marriage, but\nshe had not knowledge enough of life or of human nature to anticipate\nany such horrors as now began.  Every day, all day long the vulgar\nfight raged.  Her mother and her stepfather withdrew from each other's\npresence only to think up fresh insults to fling at each other.  As\nsoon as they were armed they hastened to give battle again.  She\navoided Presbury.  Her mother she could not avoid; and when her mother\nwas not in combat with him, she was weeping or wailing or railing to\nMildred.\n\nIt was at Mildred's urging that her mother acquiesced in Presbury's\nplans for reducing expenses within income.  At first the girl, even\nmore ignorant than her mother of practical affairs, did not appreciate\nthe wisdom, not to say the necessity, of what he wished to do, but soon\nshe saw that he was right, that the servants must go, that the horses\nand carriages and the motors must be sold.  When she was convinced and\nhad convinced her mother, she still did not realize what the thing\nreally meant.  Not until she no longer had a maid did she comprehend.\nTo a woman who has never had a maid, or who has taken on a maid as a\nluxury, it will seem an exaggeration to say that Mildred felt as\nhelpless as a baby lying alone in a crib before it has learned to\ncrawl.  Yet that is rather an understatement of her plight.  The maid\nleft in the afternoon. Mildred, not without inconveniences that had in\nthe novelty their amusing side, contrived to dress that evening for\ndinner and to get to bed; but when she awakened in the morning and was\nready to dress, the loss of Therese became a tragedy.  It took the girl\nnearly four hours to get herself together presentably--and then, never\nhad she looked so unkempt.  With her hair, thick and soft, she could do\nnothing.\n\n\"What a wonderful person Therese was!\" thought she.  \"And I always\nregarded her as rather stupid.\" Her mother, who had not had a maid\nuntil she was about thirty and had never become completely dependent,\nfared somewhat better, though, hearing her moans, you would have\nthought she was faring worse.\n\nMildred's unhappiness increased from day to day, as her wardrobe fell\ninto confusion and disrepair.  She felt that she must rise to the\nsituation, must teach herself, must save herself from impending\ndowdiness and slovenliness.  But her brain seemed to be paralyzed. She\ndid not know how or where to begin to learn.  She often in secret gave\nway to the futility of tears.\n\nThere were now only a cook and one housemaid and a man of all work--all\nthree newcomers, for Presbury insisted--most wisely--that none of the\nservants of the luxurious, wasteful days would be useful in the new\ncircumstances.  He was one of those small, orderly men who have a\ngenius for just such situations as the one he now proceeded to grapple\nwith and solve.  In his pleasure at managing everything about that\nhouse, in distributing the work among the three servants, in marketing,\nand, in inspecting purchases and nosing into the garbage-barrel, in\nlooking for dust on picture-frames and table-tops and for neglected\nweeds in the garden walks--in this multitude of engrossing delights he\nforgot his anger over the trick that had been played upon him.  He\nstill fought with his wife and denounced her and met insult with\ninsult.  But that, too, was one of his pleasures.  Also, he felt that\non the whole he had done well in marrying.  He had been lonely as a\nbachelor, had had no one to talk with, or to quarrel with, nothing to\ndo.  The marriage was not so expensive, as his wife had brought him a\nhouse--and it such a one as he had always regarded as the apogee of\nelegance.  Living was not dear in Hanging Rock, if one understood\nmanaging and gave time to it.  And socially he was at last established.\n\nSoon his wife was about as contented as she had ever been in her life.\nShe hated and despised her husband, but quarreling with him and railing\nagainst him gave her occupation and aim--two valuable assets toward\nhappiness that she had theretofore lacked.  Her living--shelter, food,\nclothing enough--was now secure. But the most important factor of all\nin her content was the one apparently too trivial to be worthy of\nrecord. From girlhood she could not recall a single day in which she\nhad not suffered from her feet.  And she had been ashamed to say\nanything about it--had never let anyone, even her maid, see her feet,\nwhich were about the only unsightly part of her.  None had guessed the\ncause of her chronic ill-temper until Presbury, that genius for the\nlittle, said within a week of their marriage:\n\n\"You talk and act like a woman with chronic corns.\"\n\nHe did not dream of the effect this chance thrust had upon his wife.\nFor the first time he had really \"landed.\"  She concealed her fright\nand her shame as best she could and went on quarreling more viciously\nthan ever.  But he presently returned to the attack. Said he:\n\n\"Your feet hurt you.  I'm sure they do.  Now that I think of it, you\nwalk that way.\"\n\n\"I suppose I deserve my fate,\" said she.  \"When a woman marries beneath\nher she must expect insult and low conversation.\"\n\n\"You must cure your feet,\" said he.  \"I'll not live in the house with a\nperson who is made fiendish by corns. I think it's only corns.  I see\nno signs of bunions.\"\n\n\"You brute!\" cried his wife, rushing from the room.\n\nBut when they met again, he at once resumed the subject, telling her\njust how she could cure herself--and he kept on telling her, she\napparently ignoring but secretly acting on his advice.  He knew what he\nwas about, and her feet grew better, grew well--and she was happier\nthan she had been since girlhood when she began ruining her feet with\ntight shoes.\n\nSix months after the marriage, Presbury and his wife were getting on\nabout as comfortably as it is given to average humanity to get on in\nthis world of incessant struggle between uncomfortable man and his\nuncomfortable environment.  But Mildred had become more and more\nunhappy.  Her mother, sometimes angrily, again reproachfully--and that\nwas far harder to bear--blamed her for \"my miserable marriage to this\nlow, quarrelsome brute.\"  Presbury let no day pass without telling her\nopenly that she was a beggar living off him, that she would better\nmarry soon or he would take drastic steps to release himself of the\nburden.  When he attacked her before her mother, there was a violent\nquarrel from which Mildred fled to hide in her room or in the remotest\npart of the garden.  When he hunted her out to insult her alone, she\nsat or stood with eyes down and face ghastly pale, mute, quivering. She\ndid not interrupt, did not try to escape.  She was like the chained and\nspiritless dog that crouches and takes the shower of blows from its\ncruel master.\n\nWhere could she go?  Nowhere.  What could she do?  Nothing.  In the\ndays of prosperity she had regarded herself as proud and high spirited.\nShe now wondered at herself!  What had become of the pride? What of the\nspirit?  She avoided looking at her image in the glass--that thin,\npallid face, those circled eyes, the drawn, sick expression about the\nmouth and nose. \"I'm stunned,\" she said to herself.  \"I've been stunned\never since father's death.  I've never recovered--nor has mother.\"  And\nshe gave way to tears--for her father, she fancied; in fact, from shame\nat her weakness and helplessness.  She thought--hoped--that she would\nnot be thus feeble and cowardly, if she were not living at home, in the\nhouse she loved, the house where she had spent her whole life.  And\nsuch a house!  Comfort and luxury and taste; every room, every corner\nof the grounds, full of the tenderest and most beautiful associations.\nAlso, there was her position in Hanging Rock.  Everywhere else she\nwould be a stranger and would have either no position at all or one\nworse than that of the utter outsider.  There, she was of the few\nlooked up to by the whole community.  No one knew, or even suspected,\nhow she was degraded by her step-father.  Before the world he was\ncourteous and considerate toward her as toward everybody.  Indeed,\nPresbury's natural instincts were gentle and kindly.  His hatred of\nMildred and his passion for humiliating her were the result of his\nconviction that he had been tricked into the marriage and his inability\nto gratify his resentment upon his wife.  He could not make the mother\nsuffer; but he could make the daughter suffer--and he did.  Besides,\nshe was of no use to him and would presently be an expense.\n\n\"Your money will soon be gone,\" he said to her. \"If you paid your just\nshare of the expenses it would be gone now.  When it is gone, what will\nyou do?\"\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"Your mother has written to your brother about you.\"\n\nMildred lifted her head, a gleam of her former spirit in her eyes. Then\nshe remembered, and bent her gaze upon the ground.\n\n\"But he, like the cur that he is, answered through a secretary that he\nwished to have nothing to do with either of you.\"\n\nMildred guessed that Frank had made the marriage an excuse.\n\n\"Surely some of your relatives will do something for you.  I have my\nhands full, supporting your mother. I don't propose to have two\nstrapping, worthless women hanging from my neck.\"\n\nShe bent her head lower, and remained silent.\n\n\"I warn you to bestir yourself,\" he went on.  \"I give you four months.\nAfter the first of the year you can't stay here unless you pay your\nshare--your third.\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"You hear what I say, miss?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied she.\n\n\"If you had any sense you wouldn't wait until your last cent was gone.\nYou'd go to New York now and get something to do.\"\n\n\"What?\" she asked--all she could trust herself to speak.\n\n\"How should _I_ know?\" retorted he furiously. \"You are a stranger to\nme.  You've been educated, I assume.  Surely there's something you can\ndo.  You've been out six years now, and have had no success, for you're\nneither married nor engaged.  You can't call it success to be flattered\nand sought by people who wanted invitations to this house when it was a\nsocial center.\"\n\nHe paused for response from her.  None came.\n\n\"You admit you are a failure?\" he said sharply.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she.\n\n\"You must have realized it several years ago,\" he went on.  \"Instead of\nallowing your mother to keep on wasting money in entertaining lavishly\nhere to give you a chance to marry, you should have been preparing\nyourself to earn a living.\"  A pause.  \"Isn't that true, miss?\"\n\nHe had a way of pronouncing the word \"miss\" that made it an epithet, a\nsneer at her unmarried and unmarriageable state.  She colored, paled,\nmurmured:\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then, better late than never.  You'll do well to follow my advice and\ngo to New York and look about you.\"\n\n\"I'll--I'll think of it,\" stammered she.\n\nAnd she did think of it.  But in all her life she had never considered\nthe idea of money-making.  That was something for men, and for the\nmiddle and lower classes--while Hanging Rock was regarded as most\nnoisomely middle class by fashionable people, it did not so regard\nitself.  Money-making was not for ladies.  Like all her class, she was\na constant and a severe critic of the women of the lower orders who\nworked for her as milliners, dressmakers, shop-attendants, cooks,\nmaids.  But, as she now realized, it is one thing to pass upon the work\nof others; it is another thing to do work oneself. She--  There was\nliterally nothing that she could do. Any occupation, even the most\nmenial, was either beyond her skill or beyond her strength, or beyond\nboth.\n\nSuddenly she recalled that she could sing.  Her prostrate spirit\nsuddenly leaped erect.  Yes, she could sing! Her voice had been praised\nby experts.  Her singing had been in demand at charity entertainments\nwhere amateurs had to compete with professionals.  Then down she\ndropped again.  She sang well enough to know how badly she sang--the\nlong and toilsome and expensive training that lay between her and\noperatic or concert or even music-hall stage.  Her voice was fine at\ntimes.  Again--most of the time--it was unreliable. No, she could not\nhope to get paying employment even as a church choir-singer.  Miss\nDresser who sang in the choir of the Good Shepherd for ten dollars a\nSunday, had not nearly so good a voice as she, but it was reliable.\n\n\"There is nothing I can do--nothing!\"\n\nAll at once, with no apparent bridge across the vast chasm, her heart\nwent out, not in pity but in human understanding and sisterly sympathy,\nto the women of the pariah class at whom, during her stops in New York,\nshe had sometimes gazed in wonder and horror.  \"Why, we and they are\nonly a step apart,\" she said to herself in amazement.  \"We and they are\nmuch nearer than my maid or the cook and they!\"\n\nAnd then her heart skipped a beat and her skin grew cold and a fog\nswirled over her brain.  If she should be cast out--if she could find\nno work and no one to support her--would she--  \"O my God!\" she moaned.\n\"I must be crazy, to think such thoughts.  I never could!  I'd die\nfirst--DIE!\"  But if anyone had pictured to her the kind of life she\nwas now leading--the humiliation and degradation she was meekly\nenduring with no thought of flight, with an ever stronger desire to\nstay on, regardless of pride and self-respect--if anyone had pictured\nthis to her as what she would endure, what would she have said?  She\ncould see herself flashing scornful denial, saying that she would\nrather kill herself.  Yet she was living--and was not even\ncontemplating suicide as a way out!\n\nA few days after Presbury gave her warning, her mother took advantage\nof his absence for his religiously observed daily constitutional to say\nto her:\n\n\"I hope you didn't think I was behind him in what he said to you about\ngoing away?\"\n\nMildred had not thought so, but in her mother's guilty tone and\nguiltier eyes she now read that her mother wished her to go.\n\n\"It'd be awful for me to be left here alone with him,\" wailed her\nmother insincerely.  \"Of course we've got no money, and beggars can't\nbe choosers.  But it'd just about kill me to have you go.\"\n\nMildred could not speak.\n\n\"I don't know a thing about money,\" Mrs. Presbury went on.  \"Your\nfather always looked after everything.\" She had fallen into the way of\nspeaking of her first husband as part of some vague, remote past,\nwhich, indeed, he had become for her.  \"This man\"--meaning\nPresbury--\"has only about five thousand a year, as you know.  I suppose\nthat's as small as he says it is.  I remember our bills for one month\nused to be as much or more than that.\"  She waved her useless, pretty\nhands helplessly.  \"I don't see HOW we are to get on, Mildred!\"\n\nHer mother wished her to go!  Her mother had fallen under the influence\nof Presbury--her mother, woman-like, or rather, ladylike, was of kin to\nthe helpless, flabby things that float in the sea and attach themselves\nto whatever they happen to lodge against.  Her mother wished her to go!\n\n\"At the same time,\" Mrs. Presbury went on, \"I can't live without\nsomebody here to stand between me and him.  I'd kill him or kill\nmyself.\"\n\nMildred muttered some excuse and fled from the room, to lock herself in.\n\nBut when she came forth again to descend to dinner, she had resolved\nnothing, because there was nothing to resolve.  When she was a child\nshe leaned from the nursery window one day and saw a stable-boy\ndrowning a rat that was in a big, oval, wire cage with a wooden bottom.\nThe boy pressed the cage slowly down in the vat of water.  The rat, in\nthe very top of the cage, watched the floor sink, watched the water\nrise.  And as it watched it uttered a strange, shrill, feeble sound\nwhich she could still remember distinctly and terribly.  It seemed to\nher now that if she were to utter any sound at all, it would be that\none.\n\n\n\nII\n\nON the Monday before Thanksgiving, Presbury went up to New York to look\nafter one of the little speculations in Wall Street at which he was so\nclever. Throughout the civilized world nowadays, and especially in and\nnear the great capitals of finance, there is a class of men and women\nof small capital and of a character in which are combined iron\nself-restraint, rabbit-like timidity, and great shrewdness, who make\noften a not inconsiderable income by gambling in stocks.  They buy only\nwhen the market is advancing strongly; they sell as soon as they have\ngained the scantest margin of profit.  They never permit themselves to\nbe tempted by the most absolute certainty of larger gains.  They will\nlet weeks, months even, go by without once risking a dollar.  They wait\nuntil they simply cannot lose.  Tens of thousands every year try to\njoin this class.  All but the few soon succumb to the hourly dazzling\ntemptations the big gamblers dangle before the eyes of the little\ngamblers to lure them within reach of the merciless shears.\n\nPresbury had for many years added from one to ten thousand a year to\nhis income by this form of gambling, success at which is in itself\nsufficient to stamp a man as infinitely little of soul.  On that Monday\nhe, venturing for the first time in six months, returned to Hanging\nRock on the three-thirty train the richer by two hundred and fifty\ndollars--as large a \"killing\" as he had ever made in any single day,\none large enough to elevate him to the rank of prince among the\n\"sure-thing snides.\" He said nothing about his luck to his family, but\nlet them attribute his unprecedented good humor to the news he brought\nand announced at dinner.\n\n\"I met an old friend in the street this afternoon,\" said he.  \"He has\ninvited us to take Thanksgiving dinner with him.  And I think it will\nbe a dinner worth while--the food, I mean, and the wine.  Not the\nguests; for there won't be any guests but us.  General Siddall is a\nstranger in New York.\"\n\n\"There are Siddalls in New York,\" said his wife; \"very nice, refined\npeople--going in the best society.\"\n\nPresbury showed his false teeth in a genial smile; for the\nold-fashioned or plate kind of false teeth they were extraordinarily\ngood--when exactly in place.  \"But not my old friend Bill Siddall,\"\nsaid he.  \"He's next door to an outlaw.  I'd not have accepted his\ninvitation if he had been asking us to dine in public.  But this is to\nbe at his own house--his new house--and a very grand house it is,\njudging by the photos he showed me. A regular palace!  He'll not be an\noutlaw long, I guess. But we must wait and see how he comes out\nsocially before we commit ourselves.\"\n\n\"Did you accept for me, too?\" asked Mrs. Presbury.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Presbury.  \"And for your daughter, too.\"\n\n\"I can't go,\" said Mildred.  \"I'm dining with the Fassetts.\"\n\nThe family no longer had a servant in constant attendance in the\ndining-room.  The maid of many functions also acted as butler and as\nfetch-and-carry between kitchen and butler's pantry.  Before speaking,\nPresbury waited until this maid had withdrawn to bring the roast and\nthe vegetables.  Then he said:\n\n\"You are going, too, miss.\"  This with the full infusion of insult into\nthe \"miss.\"\n\nMildred was silent.\n\n\"Bill Siddall is looking for a wife,\" proceeded Presbury.  \"And he has\nHeaven knows how many millions.\"\n\n\"Do you think there's a chance for Milly?\" cried Mrs. Presbury, who was\nfull of alternating hopes and fears, both wholly irrational.\n\n\"She can have him--if she wants him,\" replied Presbury.  \"But it's only\nfair to warn her that he's a stiff dose.\"\n\n\"Is the money--CERTAIN?\" inquired Mildred's mother with that shrewdness\nwhose rare occasional displays laid her open to the unjust suspicion of\nfeigning her habitual stupidity.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Presbury amiably.  \"It's nothing like yours was.  He's so\nrich he doesn't know what to do with his income.  He owns mines\nscattered all over the world.  And if they all failed, he's got bundles\nof railway stocks and bonds, and gilt-edged trust stocks, too. And he's\na comparatively young man--hardly fifty, I should say.  He pretends to\nbe forty.\"\n\n\"It's strange I never heard of him,\" said Mrs. Presbury.\n\n\"If you went to South America or South Africa or Alaska, you'd hear of\nhim,\" said Presbury.  He laughed. \"And I guess you'd hear some pretty\ndreadful things. When I knew him twenty-five years ago he had just been\narrested for forging my father's name to a check. But he got out of\nthat--and it's all past and gone. Probably he hasn't committed any\nworse crimes than have most of our big rich men.  Bill's handicap has\nbeen that he hadn't much education or any swell relatives.  But he's a\ngenius at money-making.\" Presbury looked at Mildred with a grin.  \"And\nhe's just the husband for Mildred.  She can't afford to be too\nparticular.  Somebody's got to support her.  _I_ can't and won't, and\nshe can't support herself.\"\n\n\"You'll go--won't you, Mildred?\" said her mother. \"He may not be so\nbad.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll go,\" said Mildred.  Her gaze was upon the untouched food on\nher plate.\n\n\"Of course she'll go,\" said Presbury.  \"And she'll marry him if she\ncan.  Won't you, miss?\"\n\nHe spoke in his amiably insulting way--as distinguished from the way of\nsavagely sneering insult he usually took with her.  He expected no\nreply.  She surprised him.  She lifted her tragic eyes and looked\nfixedly at him.  She said:\n\n\"Yes, I'll go.  And I'll marry him if I can.\"\n\n\"I told him he could have you,\" said Presbury.  \"I explained to him\nthat you were a rare specimen of the perfect lady--just what he\nwanted--and that you, and all your family, would be grateful to anybody\nwho would undertake your support.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury flushed angrily.  \"You've made it perfectly useless for\nher to go!\" she cried.\n\n\"Calm yourself, my love,\" said her husband.  \"I know Bill Siddall\nthoroughly.  I said what would help. I want to get rid of her as much\nas you do--and that's saying a great deal.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury flamed with the wrath of those who are justly accused.\n\"If Mildred left, I should go, too,\" cried she.\n\n\"Go where?\" inquired her husband.  \"To the poorhouse?\"\n\nBy persistent rubbing in Presbury had succeeded in making the truth\nabout her poverty and dependence clear to his wife.  She continued to\nfrown and to look unutterable contempt, but he had silenced her. He\nnoted this with a sort of satisfaction and went on:\n\n\"If Bill Siddall takes her, you certainly won't go there.  He wouldn't\nhave you.  He feels strongly on the subject of mothers-in-law.\"\n\n\"Has he been married before?\" asked Mrs. Presbury.\n\n\"Twice,\" replied her husband.  \"His first wife died. He divorced the\nsecond for unfaithfulness.\"\n\nMildred saw in this painstaking recital of all the disagreeable and\nrepellent facts about Siddall an effort further to humiliate her by\nmaking it apparent how desperately off she was, how she could not\nrefuse any offer, revolting though it might be to her pride and to her\nwomanly instincts.  Doubtless this was in part the explanation of\nPresbury's malicious candor.  But an element in that candor was a\nprudent preparing of the girl's mind for worse than the reality.  That\nhe was in earnest in his profession of a desire to bring about the\nmatch showed when he proposed that they should take rooms at a hotel in\nNew York, to give her a chance to dress properly for the dinner.  True,\nhe hastened to say that the expense must be met altogether out of the\nremnant of Mildred's share of her father's estate, but the idea would\nnot have occurred to him had he not been really planning a marriage.\n\nNever had Mildred looked more beautiful or more attractive than when\nthe three were ready to sally forth from the Manhattan Hotel on that\nThanksgiving evening. At twenty-five, a soundly healthy and vigorous\ntwenty-five, it is impossible for mind and nerves, however wrought\nupon, to make serious inroads upon surface charms.  The hope of\nemancipation from her hideous slavery had been acting upon the girl\nlike a powerful tonic.  She had gained several pounds in the three\nintervening days; her face had filled out, color had come back in all\nits former beauty to her lips.  Perhaps there was some slight aid from\nart in the extraordinary brilliancy of her eyes.\n\nPresbury inventoried her with a succession of grunts of satisfaction.\n\"Yes, he'll want you,\" he said. \"You'll strike him as just the show\npiece he needs. And he's too shrewd not to be aware that his choice is\nlimited.\"\n\n\"You can't frighten me,\" said Mildred, with a radiant, coquettish\nsmile--for practice.  \"Nothing could frighten me.\"\n\n\"I'm not trying,\" replied Presbury.  \"Nor will Siddall frighten you.  A\nwoman who's after a bill-payer can stomach anything.\"\n\n\"Or a man,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Oh, your mother wasn't as bad as all that,\" said Presbury, who never\nlost an opportunity.\n\nMrs. Presbury, seated beside her daughter in the cab, gave an\nexclamation of rage.  \"My own daughter insulting me!\" she said.\n\n\"Such a thought did not enter my head,\" protested Mildred.  \"I wasn't\nthinking of anyone in particular.\"\n\n\"Let's not quarrel now,\" said Presbury, with unprecedented amiability.\n\"We must give Bill a spectacle of the happy family.\"\n\nThe cab entered the porte-cochere of a huge palace of white stone just\noff Fifth Avenue.  The house was even grander than they had\nanticipated.  The wrought-iron fence around it had cost a small\nfortune; the house itself, without reference to its contents, a large\nfortune. The massive outer doors were opened by two lackeys in\ncherry-colored silk and velvet livery; a butler, looking like an\nEnglish gentleman, was waiting to receive them at the top of a short\nflight of marble steps between the outer and the inner entrance doors.\nAs Mildred ascended, she happened to note the sculpturing over the\ninner entrance--a reclining nude figure of a woman, Cupids with\ngarlands and hymeneal torches hovering about her.\n\nMildred had been in many pretentious houses in and near New York, but\nthis far surpassed the grandest of them.  Everything was brand new,\nseemed to have been only that moment placed, and was of the\ncostliest--statuary, carpets, armor, carved seats of stone and wood,\nmarble staircase rising majestically, tapestries, pictures,\ndrawing-room furniture.  The hall was vast, but the drawing-room was\nvaster.  Empty, one would have said that it could not possibly be\nfurnished.  Yet it was not only full, but crowded-chairs and sofas,\nhassocks and tete-a-tetes, cabinets, tables, pictures, statues, busts,\npalms, flowers, a mighty fireplace in which, behind enormous and costly\nandirons, crackled enormous and costly logs.  There was danger in\nmoving about; one could not be sure of not upsetting something, and one\nfelt that the least damage that could be done there would be an\nappallingly expensive matter.\n\nBefore that cavernous fireplace posed General Siddall.  He was a tiny\nmite of a man with a thin wiry body supporting the head of a\nprofessional barber. His black hair was glossy and most romantically\narranged.  His black mustache and imperial were waxed and\nbrilliantined.  There was no mistaking the liberal use of dye, also.\nFrom the rather thin, very sharp face looked a pair of small, muddy,\nbrown-green eyes--dull, crafty, cold, cruel.  But the little man was so\ninsignificant and so bebarbered and betailored that one could not take\nhim seriously.  Never had there been so new, so carefully pressed, so\nperfectly fitting evening clothes; never a shirt so expensively got\ntogether, or jeweled studs, waistcoat buttons and links so high priced.\nFrom every part of the room, from every part of the little man's\nperfumed and groomed person, every individual article seemed to be\nshrieking, \"The best is not too good for Bill Siddall!\"\n\nMildred was agreeably surprised--she was looking with fierce\ndetermination for agreeable surprises--when the costly little man\nspoke, in a quiet, pleasant voice with an elusive, attractive foreign\naccent.\n\n\"My, but this is grand--grand, General Siddall!\" said Presbury in the\nvoice of the noisy flatterer. \"Princely!  Royal!\"\n\nMildred glanced nervously at Siddall.  She feared that Presbury had\ntaken the wrong tone.  She saw in the unpleasant eyes a glance of\ngratified vanity.  Said he:\n\n\"Not so bad, not so bad.  I saw the house in Paris, when I was taking a\nwalk one day.  I went to the American ambassador and asked for the best\narchitect in Paris.  I went to him, told him about the house--and here\nit is.\"\n\n\"Decorations, furniture, and all!\" exclaimed Presbury.\n\n\"No, just the house.  I picked up the interiors in different parts of\nEurope--had everything reproduced where I couldn't buy outright.  I\nwant to enjoy my money while I'm still young.  I didn't care what it\ncost to get the proper surroundings.  As I said to my architect and to\nmy staff of artists, I expected to be cheated, but I wanted the goods.\nAnd I got the goods.  I'll show you through the house after dinner.\nIt's on this same scale throughout.  And they're putting me together a\ncountry place--same sort of thing.\"  He threw back his little shoulders\nand protruded his little chest.  \"And the joke of it is that the whole\nbusiness isn't costing me a cent.\"\n\n\"Not a cent less than half a dozen or a dozen millions,\" said Presbury.\n\n\"Not so much as that--not quite,\" protested the delightedly sparkling\nlittle general.  \"But what I meant was that, as fast as these fellows\nspend, I go down-town and make.  Fact is, I'm a little better off than\nI was when I started in to build.\"\n\n\"Well, you didn't get any of MY money,\" laughed Presbury.  \"But I\nsuppose pretty much everybody else in the country must have\ncontributed.\"\n\nGeneral Siddall smiled.  Mildred wondered whether the points of his\nmustache and imperial would crack and break of, if he should touch\nthem.  She noted that his hair was roached absurdly high above the\nmiddle of his forehead and that he was wearing the tallest heels she\nhad ever seen.  She calculated that, with his hair flat and his feet on\nthe ground, he would hardly come to her shoulder--and she was barely of\nwoman's medium height.  She caught sight of his hands--the square,\nstubby hands of a working man; the fingers permanently slightly curved\nas by the handle of shovel and pick; the skin shriveled but white with\na ghastly, sickening bleached white, the nails repulsively manicured\ninto long white curves.  \"If he should touch me, I'd scream,\" she\nthought.  And then she looked at Presbury--and around her at the\nevidences of enormous wealth.\n\nThe general--she wondered where he had got that title--led her mother\nin to dinner, Presbury gave her his arm.  On the way he found\nopportunity to mutter:\n\n\"Lay it on thick!  Flatter the fool.  You can't offend him.  Tell him\nhe's divinely handsome--a Louis Fourteen, a Napoleon.  Praise\neverything--napkins, tablecloth, dishes, food.  Rave over the wine.\"\n\nBut Mildred could not adopt this obviously excellent advice.  She sat\nsilent and cold, while Presbury and her mother raved and drew out the\ngeneral to talk of himself--the only subject in the whole world that\nseemed to him thoroughly worth while.  As Mildred listened and\nfurtively observed, it seemed to her that this tiny fool, so obviously\npleased by these coarse and insulting flatteries, could not possibly\nhave had the brains to amass the vast fortune he apparently possessed.\nBut presently she noted that behind the personality that was pleased by\nthis gross fawning and bootlicking there lay--lay in wait and on\nguard--another personality, one that despised these guests of his,\nestimating them at their true value and using them contemptuously for\nthe gratification of his coarse appetites.  In the glimpse she caught\nof that deeper and real personality, she liked it even less than she\nliked the one upon the surface.\n\nIt was evidence of superior acumen that she saw even vaguely the real\nBill Siddall, the money-maker, beneath the General William Siddall, raw\nand ignorant and vulgar--more vulgar in his refinement than the most\nshocking bum at home and at ease in foul-smelling stew. Every man of\nachievement hides beneath his surface--personality this second and real\nman, who makes the fortune, discovers the secret of chemistry, fights\nthe battle, carries the election, paints the picture, commits the\nfrightful murder, evolves the divine sermon or poem or symphony. Thus,\nwhen we meet a man of achievement, we invariably have a sense of\ndisappointment. \"Why, that's not the man!\" we exclaim.  \"There must be\nsome mistake.\"  And it is, indeed, not the man. Him we are incapable of\nseeing.  We have only eyes for surfaces; and, not being doers of\nextraordinary deeds, but mere plodders in the routines of existence, we\ncannot believe that there is any more to another than there is to\nourselves.  The pleasant or unpleasant surface for the conventional\nrelations of life is about all there is to us; therefore it is all\nthere is to human nature.  Well, there's no help for it.  In measuring\nour fellow beings we can use only the measurements of our own selves;\nwe have no others, and if others are given to us we are as foozled as\none knowing only feet and inches who has a tape marked off in meters\nand centimeters.\n\nIt so happened that in her social excursions Mildred had never been in\nany of the numerous homes of the suddenly and vastly rich of humble\norigin.  She was used to--and regarded as proper and elegant--the\nordinary ostentations and crudities of the rich of conventional\nsociety.  No more than you or I was she moved to ridicule or disdain by\nthe silliness and the tawdry vulgarity of the life of palace and\nliveried lackey and empty ceremonial, by the tedious entertainments, by\nthe displays of costly and poisonous food. But General Siddall's\nestablishment presented a new phase to her--and she thought it unique\nin dreadfulness and absurdity.\n\nThe general had had a home life in his youth--in a coal-miner's cabin\nnear Wilkes-Barre.  Ever since, he had lived in boarding-houses or\nhotels.  As his shrewd and rapacious mind had gathered in more and more\nwealth, he had lived more and more luxuriously--but always at hotels.\nHe had seen little of the private life of the rich.  Thus he had been\ncompelled to get his ideas of luxury and of ceremonial altogether from\nthe hotel-keepers and caterers who give the rich what the more\nintelligent and informed of the rich are usually shamed by people of\ntaste from giving themselves at home.\n\nShe thought the tablecloth, napkins, and gaudy gold and flowery cut\nglass a little overdone, but on the whole not so bad.  She had seen\nsuch almost as grand at a few New York houses.  The lace in the cloth\nand in the napkins was merely a little too magnificent.  It made the\ntable lumpy, it made the napkins unfit for use. But the way the dinner\nwas served!  You would have said you were in a glorified palace-hotel\nrestaurant. You looked about for the cashier's desk; you were certain a\nbill would be presented after the last course.\n\nThe general, tinier and more grotesque than ever in the great\nhigh-backed, richly carved armchair, surveyed the progress of the\nbanquet with the air of a god performing miracles of creation and\npassing them in review and giving them his divine endorsement.  He was\nwell pleased with the enthusiastic praises Presbury and his wife\nlavished upon the food and drink.  He would have been better pleased\nhad they preceded and followed every mouthful with a eulogy.  He\nsupplemented their compliments with even more fulsome compliments,\nadding details as to the origin and the cost.\n\n\"Darcy\"--this to the butler--\"tell the chef that this fish is the best\nyet--really exquisite.\"  To Presbury:  \"I had it brought over from\nFrance--alive, of course.  We have many excellent fish, but I like a\nchange now and then.  So I have a standing order with Prunier--he's the\nbig oyster- and fish-man of Paris--to send me over some things every\ntwo weeks by special express.  That way, an oyster costs about fifty\ncents and a fish about five or six dollars.\"\n\nTo Mrs. Presbury:  \"I'll have Darcy make you and Miss Presbury--excuse\nme, Miss Gower--bouquets of the flowers afterward.  Most of them come\nfrom New York--and very high really first-class flowers are. I pay two\ndollars apiece for my roses even at this season.  And orchids--well, I\nfeel really extravagant when I indulge in orchids as I have this\nevening.  Ten dollars apiece for those.  But they're worth it.\"\n\nThe dinner was interminably long--upward of twenty kinds of food, no\nless than five kinds of wine; enough served and spoiled to have fed and\nintoxicated a dozen people at least.  And upon every item of food and\ndrink the general had some remarks to make.  He impressed it upon his\nguests that this dinner was very little better than the one served to\nhim every night, that the increase in expense and luxury was not in\ntheir honor, but in his own--to show them what he could do when he\nwished to make a holiday.  Finally the grand course was reached.  Into\nthe dining-room, to the amazement of the guests, were rolled two great\nrestaurant joint wagons.  Instead of being made of silver-plated nickel\nor plain nickel they were of silver embossed with gold, and the large\ncarvers and serving-spoons and forks had gold-mounted silver handles.\nWhen the lackeys turned back the covers there were disclosed several\ntruly wonderful young turkeys, fattened as if by painstaking and\nskillful hand and superbly browned.\n\nUp to that time the rich and costly food had been sadly medium--like\nthe wines.  But these turkeys were a genuine triumph.  Even Mildred\ngave them a look of interest and admiration.  In a voice that made\nGeneral Siddall ecstatic Presbury cried:\n\n\"GOD bless my soul!  WHERE did you get those beauties, old man!\"\n\n\"Paris,\" said Siddall in a voice tremulous with pride and\nself-admiration.  You would have thought that he had created not merely\nthe turkeys, but Paris, also. \"Potin sends them over to me.  Potin, you\nknow, is the finest dealer in groceries, fruit, game, and so on in the\nworld.  I have a standing order with him for the best of--everything\nthat comes in.  I'd hate to tell you what my bill with Potin is every\nmonth--he only sends it to me once a year.  Really, I think I ought to\nbe ashamed of myself, but I reason that, if a man can afford it, he's a\nfool to put anything but the best into his stomach.\"\n\n\"You're right there!\" mumbled Presbury.  His mouth was full of turkey.\n\"You HAVE got a chef, General!\"\n\n\"He ought to cook well.  I pay him more than most bank-presidents get.\nWhat do you think of those joint wagons, Mrs. Presbury?\"\n\n\"They're very--interesting,\" replied she, a little nervous because she\nsuspected they were some sort of vulgar joke.\n\n\"I knew you'd like them,\" said the general.  \"My own idea entirely.  I\nsaw them in several restaurants abroad--only of course those they had\nwere just ordinary affairs, not fit to be introduced into a gentleman's\ndining-room.  But I took the idea and adapted it to my purposes--and\nthere you are!\"\n\n\"Very original, old man,\" said Presbury, who had been drinking too\nmuch.  \"I've never seen it before, and I don't think I ever shall\nagain.  Got the idea patented?\"\n\nBut Siddall in his soberest moment would have been slow to admit a\nsuspicion that any of the human race, which he regarded as on its knees\nbefore him, was venturing to poke fun at him.  Drunk as he now was, the\nopenest sarcasm would have been accepted as a compliment. After a\ngorgeous dessert which nobody more than touched--a molded mousse of\nwhipped and frozen cream and strawberries--\"specially sent on to me\nfrom Florida and costing me a dollar apiece, I guess\"--after this\ncostly wonder had disappeared fruit was served. General Siddall had\nready a long oration upon this course.  He delivered it in a\ndisgustingly thick tone. The pineapple was an English hothouse product,\nthe grapes were grown by a costly process under glass in Belgium.  As\nfor the peaches, Potin had sent those delicately blushing marvels, and\nthe charge for this would be \"not less than a louis apiece, sir--a\nlouis d'or--which, as you no doubt know, is about four dollars of Uncle\nSam's money.\"\n\nThe coffee--\"the Queen of Holland may have it on her PRIVATE\ntable--MAY, I say--but I doubt if anyone else in the world gets a smell\nof it except me\"--the coffee and the brandy came not a moment too soon.\nPresbury was becoming stupefied with indigestion; his wife was nodding\nand was wearing that vague, forced, pleasant smile which stands\npropriety-guard over a mind asleep; Mildred Gower felt that her nerves\nwould endure no more; and the general was falling into a besotted\nstate, spilling his wine, mumbling his words. The coffee and the brandy\nrevived them all somewhat. Mildred, lifting her eyes, saw by way of a\nmirrored section of the enormous sideboard the English butler surveying\nmaster and guests with slowly moving, sneering glance of ineffable\ncontempt.\n\nIn the drawing-room again Mildred, requested by Siddall and ordered by\nPresbury, sang a little French song and then--at the urging of\nSiddall--\"Annie Laurie.\"  Siddall was wiping his eyes when she turned\naround.  He said to Presbury:\n\n\"Take your wife into the conservatory to look at my orchids.  I want to\nsay a word to your stepdaughter.\"\n\nMildred started up nervously.  She saw how drunk the general was, saw\nthe expression of his face that a woman has to be innocent indeed not\nto understand. She was afraid to be left alone with him.  Presbury came\nup to her, said rapidly, in a low tone:\n\n\"It's all right.  He's got a high sense of what's due a respectable\nwoman of our class.  He isn't as drunk as he looks and acts.\"\n\nHaving said which, he took his wife by the arm and pushed her into the\nadjoining conservatory.  Mildred reseated herself upon the inlaid\npiano-bench.  The little man, his face now shiny with the sweat of\ndrink and emotion, drew up a chair in front of her.  He sat--and he was\nalmost as tall sitting as standing.  He said graciously:\n\n\"Don't be afraid, my dear girl.  I'm not that dangerous.\"\n\nShe lifted her eyes and looked at him.  She tried to conceal her\naversion; she feared she was not succeeding. But she need not have\nconcerned herself about that. General Siddall, after the manner of very\nrich men, could not conceive of anyone being less impressed with his\nsuperiority in any way than he himself was.  For years he had heard\nonly flatteries of himself--his own voice singing his praises, the\nfawning voices of those he hired and of those hoping to get some\nfinancial advantage.  He could not have imagined a mere woman not being\noverwhelmed by the prospect of his courting her.  Nor would it have\nentered his head that his money would be the chief, much less the only,\nconsideration with her.  He had long since lost all point of view, and\nbelieved that the adulation paid his wealth was evoked by his charms of\nperson, mind, and manner.  Those who imagine this was evidence of folly\nand weak-mindedness and extraordinary vanity show how little they know\nhuman nature.  The strongest head could not remain steady, the most\naccurate eyes could not retain their measuring skill, in such an\nenvironment as always completely envelops wealth and power.  And the\nmuch-talked-of difference between those born to wealth and power and\nthose who rise to it from obscurity resolves itself to little more than\nthe difference between those born mad and those who go insane.\n\nLooking at the little man with the disagreeable eyes, so dull yet so\nshrewd, Mildred saw that within the drunkard who could scarcely sit\nstraight upon the richly upholstered and carved gilt chair there was\nanother person, coldly sober, calmly calculating.  And she realized\nthat it was this person with whom she was about to have the most\nserious conversation of her life thus far.\n\nThe drunkard smiled with a repulsive wiping and smacking of the thin,\nsensual lips.  \"I suppose you know why I had you brought here this\nevening?\" said he.\n\nMildred looked and waited.\n\n\"I didn't intend to say anything to-night.  In fact, I didn't expect to\nfind in you what I've been looking for.  I thought that old fool of a\nstepfather of yours was cracking up his goods beyond their merits.  But\nhe wasn't.  My dear, you suit me from the ground up.  I've been looking\nyou over carefully.  You were made for the place I want to fill.\"\n\nMildred had lowered her eyes.  Her face had become deathly pale.  \"I\nfeel faint,\" she murmured.  \"It is very warm here.\"\n\n\"You're not sickly?\" inquired the general sharply. \"You look like a\ngood solid woman--thin but wiry. Ever been sick?  I must look into your\nhealth.  That's a point on which I must be satisfied.\"\n\nA wave of anger swept through her, restoring her strength.  She was\nabout to speak--a rebuke to his colossal impudence that he would not\nsoon forget. Then she remembered, and bit her lips.\n\n\"I don't ask you to decide to-night,\" pursued he, hastening to explain\nthis concession by adding:  \"I don't intend to decide, myself.  All I\nsay is that I am willing--if the goods are up to the sample.\"\n\nMildred saw her stepfather and her mother watching from just within the\nconservatory door.  A movement of the portiere at the door into the\nhall let her know that Darcy, the butler, was peeping and listening\nthere.  She stood up, clenched her hands, struck them together, struck\nthem against her temples, crossed the room swiftly, flung herself down\nupon a sofa, and burst into tears.  Presbury and his wife entered.\nSiddall was standing, looking after Mildred with a grin.  He winked at\nPresbury and said:\n\n\"I guess we gave her too much of that wine.  It's all old and stronger\nthan you'd think.\"\n\n\"My daughter hardly touched her glasses,\" cried Mrs. Presbury.\n\n\"I know that, ma'am,\" replied Siddall.  \"I watched her.  If she'd done\nmuch drinking, I'd have been done, then and there.\"\n\n\"I suspect she's upset by what you've been saying, General,\" said\nPresbury.  \"Wasn't it enough to upset a girl?  You don't realize how\nmagnificent you are--how magnificent everything is here.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry if I upset her,\" said the general, swelling and loftily\ncontrite.  \"I don t know why it is that people never seem to be able to\nact natural with me.\"  He hated those who did, regarding them as\nsodden, unappreciative fools.\n\nMrs. Presbury was quieting her daughter.  Presbury and Siddall lighted\ncigars and went into the smoking--and billiard-room across the hall.\nSaid Presbury:\n\n\"I didn't deceive you, did I, General?\"\n\n\"She's entirely satisfactory,\" replied Siddall.  \"I'm going to make\ncareful inquiries about her character and her health.  If those things\nprove to be all right I'm ready to go ahead.\"\n\n\"Then the thing's settled,\" said Presbury.  \"She's all that a lady\nshould be.  And except a cold now and then she never has anything the\nmatter with her.  She comes of good healthy stock.\"\n\n\"I can't stand a sickly, ailing woman,\" said Siddall. \"I wouldn't marry\none, and if one I married turned out to be that kind, I'd make short\nwork of her.  When you get right down to facts, what is a woman?  Why,\na body.  If she ain't pretty and well, she ain't nothing. While I'm\nlooking up her pedigree, so to speak, I want you to get her mother to\nexplain to her just what kind of a man I am.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" said Presbury.\n\n\"Have her told that I don't put up with foolishness. If she wants to\nlook at a man, let her look at me.\"\n\n\"You'll have no trouble in that way,\" said Presbury.\n\n\"I DID have trouble in that way,\" replied the general sourly.  \"Women\nare fools--ALL women.  But the principal trouble with the second Mrs.\nSiddall was that she wasn't a lady born.\"\n\n\"That's why I say you'll have no trouble,\" said Presbury.\n\n\"Well, I want her mother to talk to her plainer than a gentleman can\ntalk to a young lady.  I want her to understand that I am marrying so\nthat I can have a WIFE--cheerful, ready, and healthy.  I'll not put up\nwith foolishness of any kind.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Presbury.  \"You'll find that she'll meet all your\nconditions.\"\n\n\"Explain to her that, while I'm the easiest, most liberal-spending man\nin the world when I'm getting what I want, I am just the opposite when\nI'm not getting what I pay for.  If I take her and if she acts right,\nshe'll have more of everything that women want than any woman in the\nworld.  I'd take a pride in my wife. There isn't anything I wouldn't\nspend in showing her off to advantage.  And I'm willing to be liberal\nwith her mother, too.\"\n\nPresbury had been hoping for this.  His eyes sparkled. \"You're a\nprince, General,\" he said.  \"A genuine prince.  You know how to do\nthings right.\"\n\n\"I flatter myself I do,\" said the general.  \"I've been up and down the\nworld, and I tell you most of the kings live cheap beside me.  And when\nI get a wife worth showing of, I'll do still better.  I've got\nwonderful creative ability.  There isn't anything I can't and won't\nbuy.\"\n\nPresbury noted uneasily how cold and straight, how obviously repelled\nand repelling the girl was as she yielded her fingers to Siddall at the\nleave-taking.  He and her mother covered the silence and ice with hot\nand voluble sycophantry.  They might have spared themselves the\nexertion.  To Siddall Mildred was at her most fascinating when she was\nthus \"the lady and the queen.\"  The final impression she made upon him\nwas the most favorable of all.\n\nIn the cab Mrs. Presbury talked out of the fullness of an overflowing\nheart.  \"What a remarkable man the general is!\" said she.  \"You've only\nto look at him to realize that you're in the presence of a really\nsuperior person.  And what tact he has!--and how generous he is!--and\nhow beautifully he entertains! So much dignity--so much simplicity--so\nmuch--\"\n\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" interrupted Presbury.  \"Your daughter isn't a damn\nfool, Mrs. Presbury.\"\n\nMildred gave a short, dry laugh.\n\nUp flared her mother.  \"I mean every word I said!\" cried she.  \"If I\nhadn't admired and appreciated him, I'd certainly not have acted as I\ndid.  _I_ couldn't stoop to such hypocrisy.\"\n\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" sneered Presbury.  \"Bill Siddall is a horror.  His\nhouse is a horror.  His dinner was a horror.  These loathsome rich\npeople!  They're ruining the world--as they always have.  They're\nmaking it impossible for anyone to get good service or good food or\ngood furniture or good clothing or good anything.  They don't know good\nthings, and they pay exorbitant prices for showy trash, for crude\nvulgar luxury.  They corrupt taste.  They make everyone round them or\nnear them sycophants and cheats.  They substitute money for\nintelligence and discrimination. They degrade every fine thing in life.\nCivilization is built up by brains and hard work, and along come the\nrich and rot and ruin it!\"\n\nMildred and her mother were listening in astonishment. Said the mother:\n\n\"I'd be ashamed to confess myself such a hypocrite.\"\n\n\"And I, madam, would be ashamed to be such a hypocrite without taking a\nbath of confession afterward,\" retorted Presbury.\n\n\"At least you might have waited until Mildred wasn't in hearing,\"\nsnapped she.\n\n\"I shall marry him if I can,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"And blissfully happy you'll be,\" said Presbury. \"Women, ladies--true\nladies, like you and your mother--have no sensibilities.  All you ask\nis luxury. If Bill Siddall were a thousand times worse than he is, his\nmoney would buy him almost any refined, delicate lady anywhere in\nChristendom.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury laughed angrily.  \"YOU, talking like this--you of all\nmen.  Is there anything YOU wouldn't stoop to for money?\"\n\n\"Do you think I laid myself open to that charge by marrying you?\" said\nPresbury, made cheerful despite his savage indigestion by the\nopportunity for effective insult she had given him and he had promptly\nseized. \"I am far too gallant to agree with you.  But I'm also too\ngallant to contradict a lady.  By the way, you must be careful in\ndealing with Siddall.  Rich people like to be fawned on, but not to be\nslobbered on. You went entirely too far.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury, whom indigestion had rendered stupid, could think of no\nreply.  So she burst into tears. \"And my own daughter sitting silent\nwhile that man insults her mother!\" she sobbed.\n\nMildred sat stiff and cold.\n\n\"It'll be a week before I recover from that dinner,\" Presbury went on\nsourly.  \"What a dinner!  What a villainous mess!  These vulgar, showy\nrich!  That champagne!  He said it cost him six dollars a bottle, and\nno doubt it did.  I doubt if it ever saw France. The dealers rarely\nwaste genuine wine on such cattle. The wine-cellars of fine houses the\nworld through are the laughing-stock of connoisseurs--like their\npicture-galleries and their other attempts to make money do the work of\ntaste.  I forgot to put my pills in my bag. I'll have to hunt up an\nall-night drug-store.  I'd not dare go to bed without taking an\nantidote for that poison.\"\n\nBut Presbury had not been altogether improvident. He had hoped great\nthings of Bill Siddall's wine-cellar--this despite an almost unbroken\nseries of bitter disillusionments and disappointments in experience\nwith those who had the wealth to buy, if they had had the taste to\nselect, the fine wines he loved.  So, resolving to indulge himself, he\nhad put into his bag his pair of gout-boots.\n\nThis was a device of his own inventing, on which he prided himself.  It\nconsisted of a pair of roomy doe-skin slippers reenforced with heavy\nsoles and provided with a set of three thin insoles to be used\naccording as the state of his toes made advisable.  The cost of the\nPresbury gout-boot had been, thanks to patient search for a cheap\ncobbler, something under four dollars--this, when men paid shoe\nspecialists twenty, thirty, and even forty dollars a pair for\ngout-boots that gave less comfort.  The morning after the dinner at\nwhich he had drunk to drown his chagrin and to give him courage and\ntongue for sycophantry, he put on the boots. Without them it would have\nbeen necessary to carry him from his room to a cab and from cab to\ntrain.  With them he was able to hobble to a street-car.  He tried to\ndistract his mind from his sufferings by lashing away without ceasing\nat his wife and his step-daughter.\n\nWhen they were once more at home, and the mother and daughter escaped\nfrom him, the mother said:\n\n\"I was glad to see that you put up with that wretch, and didn't answer\nhim back.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mildred.  \"He's mad to be rid of me, but if I\noffended him he might snatch away this chance.\"\n\n\"He would,\" said Mrs. Presbury.  \"I'm sure he would.  But--\" she\nlaughed viciously--\"once you're married you can revenge yourself--and\nme!\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Mildred thoughtfully.\n\n\"Why not?\" exclaimed her mother, irritated.\n\n\"I can't make Mr. Presbury out,\" replied the girl. \"I understand why\nhe's helping me to this chance, but I don't understand why he isn't\nmaking friends with me, in the hope of getting something after I'm\nmarried.\"\n\nHer mother saw the point, and was instantly agitated. \"Perhaps he's\nsimply leading you on, intending to upset it all at the last minute.\"\nShe gritted her teeth. \"Oh, what a wretch!\"\n\nMildred was not heeding.  \"I must have General Siddall looked up\ncarefully,\" she went on.  \"It may be that he isn't rich, or that he has\nanother wife somewhere, or that there's some other awful reason why\nmarrying him would be even worse than it seems.\"\n\n\"Worse than it seems!\" cried her mother.  \"How CAN you talk so, Milly!\nThe general seems to be an ideal husband--simply ideal!  I wish _I_ had\nyour chance.  Any sensible woman could love him.\"\n\nA strange look came into the girl's face, and her mother could not\nwithstand her eyes.  \"Don't, mother,\" she said quietly.  \"Either you\ntake me for a fool or you are trying to show me that you have no\nself-respect.  I am not deceiving myself about what I'm doing.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury opened her lips to remonstrate, changed her mind, drew a\ndeep sigh.  \"It's frightful to be a woman,\" she said.\n\n\"To be a lady, Mr. Presbury would say,\" suggested Mildred.\n\nAfter some discussion, they fixed upon Joseph Tilker as the best\navailable investigator of General Siddall. Tilker had been head clerk\nfor Henry Gower.  He was now in for himself and had offered to look\nafter any legal business Mrs. Presbury might have without charging her.\nHe presently reported that there was not a doubt as to the wealth of\nthe little general. \"There are all sorts of ugly stories about how he\nmade his money,\" said Tilker; \"but all the great fortunes have a\nscandalous history, and I doubt if Siddall's is any worse than the\nothers.  I don't see how it well could be.  Siddall has the reputation\nof being a mean and cruel little tyrant.  He is said to be pompous,\nvain, ignorant--\"\n\n\"Indeed he's not,\" cried Mrs. Presbury.  \"He's a rough diamond, but a\nnatural gentleman.  I've met him.\"\n\n\"Well, he's rich enough, and that was all you asked me to find out,\"\nsaid Tilker.  \"But I must warn you, Mrs. Presbury, not to have any\nbusiness or intimate personal relations with him.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury congratulated herself on her wisdom in having come alone\nto hear Tilker's report.  She did not repeat any part of it to Mildred\nexcept what he had said about the wealth.  That she enlarged upon until\nMildred's patience gave out.  She interrupted with a shrewd:\n\n\"Anything else, mamma?  Anything about him personally?\"\n\n\"We've got to judge him in that way for ourselves,\" replied Mrs.\nPresbury.  \"You know how wickedly they lie about anyone who has\nanything.\"\n\n\"I should like to read a full account of General Siddall,\" said Mildred\nreflectively; \"just to satisfy my curiosity.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury made no reply.\n\nPresbury had decided that it was best to make no advance, but to wait\nuntil they heard from Siddall.  He let a week, ten days, go by; then\nhis impatience got the better of his shrewdness.  He sought admittance\nto the great man at the offices of the International Metals and\nMinerals Company in Cedar Street.  After being subjected to varied\nindignities by sundry under-strappers, he received a message from the\ngeneral through a secretary:  \"The general says he'll let you know when\nhe's ready to take up that matter.  He says he hasn't got round to it\nyet.\"  Presbury apologized courteously for his intrusion and went away,\ncursing under his breath.  You may be sure that he made his wife and\nhis stepdaughter suffer for what he had been through.  Two weeks more\npassed--three--a month. One morning in the mail there arrived this\nnote--type-written upon business paper:\n\n\nJAMES PRESBURY, Esqr.:\n\nDEAR SIR:\n\nGeneral Siddall asks me to present his compliments and to say that he\nwill be pleased if you and your wife and the young lady will dine with\nhim at his house next Thursday the seventeenth at half-past seven sharp.\n\nROBERT CHANDLESS, Secretary.\n\n\nThe only words in longhand were the two forming the name of the\nsecretary.  Presbury laughed and tossed the note across the breakfast\ntable to his wife. \"You see what an ignorant creature he is,\" said he.\n\"He imagines he has done the thing up in grand style. He's the sort of\nman that can't be taught manners because he thinks manners, the\nordinary civilities, are for the lower orders of people.  Oh, he's a\njoke, is Bill Siddall--a horrible joke.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury read and passed the letter to Mildred. She simply glanced\nat it and returned it to her step-father.\n\n\"I'm just about over that last dinner,\" pursued Presbury.  \"I'll eat\nlittle Thursday and drink less. And I'd advise you to do the same, Mrs.\nPresbury.\"\n\nHe always addressed her as \"Mrs. Presbury\" because he had discovered\nthat when so addressed she always winced, and, if he put a certain tone\ninto his voice, she quivered.\n\n\"That dinner aged you five years,\" he went on. \"Besides, you drank so\nmuch that it went to your head and made you slather him with flatteries\nthat irritated him.  He thought you were a fool, and no one is stupid\nenough to like to be flattered by a fool.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury bridled, swallowed hard, said mildly: \"We'll have to\nspend the night in town again, I suppose.\"\n\n\"You and your daughter may do as you like,\" said Presbury.  \"I shall\nreturn here that night.  I always catch cold in strange beds.\"\n\n\"We might as well all return here,\" said Mildred. \"I shall not wear\nevening dress; that is, I'll wear a high-neck dress and a hat.\"\n\nShe had just got a new hat that was peculiarly becoming to her.  She\nhad shown Siddall herself at the best in evening attire; another sort\nof costume would give him a different view of her looks, one which she\nflattered herself was not less attractive.  But Presbury interposed an\nemphatic veto.\n\n\"You'll wear full evening dress,\" said he.  \"Bare neck and arms for men\nlike Bill Siddall.  They want to see what they're getting.\"\n\nMildred flushed scarlet and her lips trembled as though she were about\nto cry.  In fact, her emotion was altogether shame--a shame so poignant\nthat even Presbury was abashed, and mumbled something apologetic.\nNevertheless she wore a low-neck dress on Thursday evening, one as\ndaring as the extremely daring fashions of that year permitted an\nunmarried woman to wear.  It seemed to her that Siddall was still more\ncostly and elegant-looking than before, though this may have been due\nto the fact that he always created an impression that in the retrospect\nof memory seemed exaggerated.  It seemed impossible that anyone could\nbe so clean, so polished and scoured, so groomed and tailored, so\nbedecked, so high-heeled and loftily coiffed. His mean little\ncountenance with its grotesquely waxed mustache and imperial wore an\nexpression of gracious benignity that assured his guests they need\nanticipate no disagreeable news.\n\n\"I owe you an apology for keeping you in suspense so long,\" said he.\n\"I'm a very busy man, with interests in all parts of the world.  I keep\nhouse--some of 'em bigger than this--open and going in six different\nplaces.  I always like to be at home wherever my business takes me.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury rolled her eyes.  \"Isn't that WONDERFUL!\" she exclaimed.\n\"What an interesting life you must lead!\"\n\n\"Oh, so--so,\" replied the general.  \"But I get awful lonesome.  I'm\nnaturally a domestic man.  I don't care for friends.  They're expensive\nand dangerous. A man in my position is like a king.  He can't have\nfriends.  So, if he hasn't got a family, he hasn't got noth--anything.\"\n\n\"Nothing like home life,\" said Presbury.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Presbury.\n\nThe little general smiled upon Mildred, sitting pale and silent, with\neyes downcast.  \"Well, I don't intend to be alone much longer, if I can\nhelp it,\" said he. \"And I may say that I can make a woman happy if\nshe's the right sort--if she has sense enough to appreciate a good\nhusband.\"  This last he said sternly, with more than a hint of his past\nmatrimonial misfortunes in his frown and in his voice.  \"The trouble\nwith a great many women is that they're fools--flighty, ungrateful\nfools.  If I married a woman like that, I'd make short work of her.\"\n\n\"And she'd deserve it, General,\" said Mildred's mother earnestly.  \"But\nyou'll have no trouble if you select a lady--a girl who's been well\nbrought up and has respect for herself.\"\n\n\"That's my opinion, ma'am,\" said the general. \"I'm convinced that while\na man can become a gentleman, a woman's got to be born a lady or she\nnever is one.\"\n\n\"Very true, General,\" cried Mrs. Presbury.  \"I never thought of it\nbefore, but it's the truest thing I ever heard.\"\n\nPresbury grinned at his plate.  He stole a glance at Mildred.  Their\neyes met.  She flushed faintly.\n\n\"I've had a great deal of experience of women,\" pursued the general.\n\"In my boyhood days I was a ladies' man.  And of course since I've had\nmoney they've swarmed round me like bees in a clover-patch.\"\n\n\"Oh, General, you're far too modest,\" cried Mrs. Presbury.  \"A man like\nyou wouldn't need to be afraid, if he hadn't a cent.\"\n\n\"But not the kind of women I want,\" replied he, firmly if complacently.\n\"A lady needs money to keep up her position.  She has to have it.  On\nthe other hand, a man of wealth and station needs a lady to assist him\nin the proper kind of life for men of his sort. So they need each\nother.  They've got to have each other.  That's the practical, sensible\nway to look at it.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Presbury.\n\n\"And I've made up my mind to marry, and marry right away.  But we'll\ncome back to this later on. Presbury, you're neglecting that wine.\"\n\n\"I'm drinking it slowly to enjoy it better,\" said Presbury.\n\nThe dinner was the same unending and expensive function that had\nwearied them and upset their digestions on Thanksgiving Day.  There was\ntoo much of everything, and it was all just wrong.  The general was not\nquite so voluble as he had been before; his gaze was fixed most of the\ntime on Mildred--roving from her lovely face to her smooth, slender\nshoulders and back again.  As he drank and ate his gesture of slightly\nsmacking his thin lips seemed to include an enjoyment of the girl's\ncharms.  And a sensitive observer might have suspected that she was not\nunconscious of this and was suffering some such pain as if abhorrent\nand cruel lips and teeth were actually mouthing and mumbling her.  She\nsaid not a word from sitting down at table until they rose to go into\nthe library for coffee.\n\n\"Do tell me about your early life, General,\" Mrs. Presbury said.  \"Only\nthe other day Millie was saying she wished she could read a biography\nof your romantic career.\"\n\n\"Yes, it has been rather--unusual,\" conceded the general with swelling\nchest and gently waving dollar-and-a-half-apiece cigar.\n\n\"I do so ADMIRE a man who carves out his own fortune,\" Mrs. Presbury\nwent on--she had not obeyed her husband's injunction as to the\nchampagne.  \"It seems so wonderful to me that a man could with his own\nhands just dig a fortune out of the ground.\"\n\n\"He couldn't, ma'am,\" said the general, with gracious tolerance.  \"It\nwasn't till I stopped the fool digging and hunting around for gold that\nI began to get ahead.  I threw away the pick and shovel and opened a\nhotel.\"  (There were two or three sleeping-rooms of a kind in that\n\"hotel,\" but it was rather a saloon of the species known as \"doggery.\")\n\"Yes, it was in the hotel that I got my start.  The fellows that make\nthe money in mining countries ain't the prospectors and diggers, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Really!\" cried Mrs. Presbury breathlessly.  \"How interesting!\"\n\n\"They're fools, they are,\" proceeded the general. \"No, the money's made\nby the fellows that grub-stake the fools--give 'em supplies and send\n'em out to nose around in the mountains.  Then them that find anything\nhave to give half to the fellow that did the grub-staking.  And he\nlooks into the claim, and if there's anything in it, why, he buys the\nfool out.  In mines, like everywhere else, ma'am, it ain't work, it's\nbrains that makes the money.  No miner ever made a mining fortune--not\none.  It's the brainy, foxy fellows that stay back in the camps.  I\nused to send out fifty and a hundred men a year.  Maybe only two or\nthree'd turn up anything worth while.  No, ma'am, I never got a dollar\nahead on my digging.  All the gold I ever dug went right off for\ngrub--or a good time.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" exclaimed Mrs. Presbury.  \"I never heard of such a thing.\"\n\n\"But we're not here to talk about mines,\" said the general, his eyes\nupon Mildred.  \"I've been looking into matters--to get down to\nbusiness--and I've asked you here to let you know that I'm willing to\ngo ahead.\"\n\nProfound silence.  Mildred suddenly drew in her breath with a sound so\nsharp that the three others started and glanced hastily at her.  But\nshe made no further sign.  She sat still and cold and pale.\n\nThe general, perfectly at ease, broke the silence. \"I think Miss Gower\nand I would get on faster alone.\"\n\nPresbury at once stood up; his wife hesitated, her eyes uneasily upon\nher daughter.  Presbury said: \"Come on, Alice.\"  She rose and preceded\nhim into the adjoining conservatory.  The little general posed himself\nbefore the huge open fire, one hand behind him, the other at the level\nof his waistcoat, the big cigar between his first and second fingers.\n\"Well, my dear?\" said he.\n\nMildred somewhat hesitatingly lifted her eyes; but, once she had them\nup, their gaze held steadily enough upon his--too steadily for his\ncomfort.  He addressed himself to his cigar:\n\n\"I'm not quite ready to say I'm willing to go the limit,\" said he.  \"We\ndon't exactly know each other sufficiently well as yet, do we?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"I've been making inquiries,\" he went on; \"that is, I had my chief\nsecretary make them--and he's a very thorough man, thanks to my\ntraining.  He reports everything entirely all right.  I admire dignity\nand reserve in a woman, and you have been very particular. Were you\nengaged to Stanley Baird?\"\n\nMildred flushed, veiled her eyes to hide their resentful flash at this\nimpertinence.  She debated with herself, decided that any rebuke short\nof one that would anger him would be wasted upon him.  \"No,\" said she.\n\n\"That agrees with Harding's report,\" said the general.  \"It was a mere\ngirlish flirtation--very dignified and proper,\" he hastened to add.  \"I\ndon't mean to suggest that you were at all flighty.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mildred sweetly.\n\n\"Are there any questions you would like to ask about me?\" inquired he.\n\n\"No,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"As I understand it--from my talk with Presbury--you are willing to go\non?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mildred.\n\nThe general smiled genially.  \"I think I may say without conceit that\nyou will like me as you know me better.  I have no bad habits--I've too\nmuch regard for my health to over-indulge or run loose.  In my boyhood\ndays I may have put in rather a heavy sowing of wild oats\"--the general\nlaughed; Mildred conjured up the wintriest and faintest of echoing\nsmiles--\"but that's all past,\" he went on, \"and there's nothing that\ncould rise up to interfere with our happiness.  You are fond of\nchildren?\"\n\nA pause, then Mildred said quite evenly, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" said the general.  \"I'll expect you and your mother and\nfather to dinner Sunday night.  Is that satisfactory?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mildred.\n\nA longish pause.  Then the general:  \"You seem to be a little--afraid\nof me.  I don't know why it is that people are always that way with\nme.\"  A halt, to give her the opportunity to say the obvious flattering\nthing. Mildred said nothing, gave no sign.  He went on:  \"It will wear\naway as we know each other better.  I am a simple, plain man--kind and\ngenerous in my instincts. Of course I am dignified, and I do not like\nfamiliarity. But I do not mean to inspire fear and awe.\"\n\nA still longer pause.  \"Well, everything is settled,\" said the general.\n\"We understand each other clearly?--not an engagement, nothing binding\non either side--simply a--a--an option without forfeit.\"  And he\nlaughed--his laugh was a ghoulish sound, not loud but explosive and an\ninstant check upon demonstration of mirth from anyone else.\n\n\"I understand,\" said Mildred with a glance toward the door through\nwhich Presbury and his wife had disappeared.\n\n\"Now, we'll join the others, and I'll show you the house\"--again the\nlaugh--\"what may be your future home--one of them.\"\n\nThe four were soon started upon what was for three of them a weariful\njourney despite the elevator that spared them the ascents of the\nstairways.  The house was an exaggerated reproduction of all the\nestablishments of the rich who confuse expenditure with luxury and\ncomfort.  Bill Siddall had bought \"the best of everything\"; that is,\nthe things into which the purveyors of costly furnishings have put the\nmost excuses for charging.  Of taste, of comfort, of discrimination,\nthere were few traces and these obviously accidental. \"I picked out the\nmen acknowledged to be the best in their different lines,\" said the\ngeneral, \"and I gave them carte blanche.\"\n\n\"I see that at a glance,\" said Presbury.  \"You've done the grand thing\non the grandest possible scale.\"\n\n\"I've looked into the finest of the famous places on the other side,\"\nsaid the general.  \"All I can say is, I've had no regrets.\"\n\n\"I should say not,\" cried Mrs. Presbury.\n\nWith an affectation of modest hesitation--to show that he was a\ngentleman with a gentleman's fine appreciation of the due of maiden\nmodesty--Siddall paused at the outer door of his own apartments.  But\nat one sentence of urging from Mrs. Presbury he opened the door and\nushered them in.  And soon he was showing them everything--his Carrara\nmarble bathroom and bathing-pool, his bed that had been used by several\nFrench kings, his dressing-room with its appliances of gold and\nplatinum and precious stones, his clothing. They had to inspect a room\nfull of suits, huge chiffoniers crowded with shirts and ties and\nunderclothes. He exhibited silk dressing-robes and pajamas, pointed out\nthe marks of the fashionable London and Paris makers, the monograms,\nthe linings of ermine and sable. \"I'm very particular about everything\nthat touches me,\" explained he.  \"It seems to me a gentleman can't be\ntoo particular.\"  With a meaning glance at Mildred, \"And I'd feel the\nsame way about my wife.\"\n\n\"You hear that, Mildred?\" said Presbury, with a nasty little laugh.  He\nhad been relieving the tedium of this sight-seeing tour by\nobserving--and from time to time aggravating--Mildred's sufferings.\n\nThe general released his mirth-strangling goat laugh; Mrs. Presbury\nechoed it with a gale of rather wild hysterics.  So well pleased was\nthe general with the excursion and so far did he feel advanced toward\nintimacy that on the way down the majestic marble stairway he ventured\nto give Mildred's arm a gentle, playful squeeze.  And at the parting he\nkissed her hand.  Presbury had changed his mind about returning to the\ncountry.  On the way to the hotel he girded at Mildred, reviewing all\nthat the little general had said and done, and sneering, jeering at it.\nMildred made not a single retort until they were upstairs in the hotel.\nAt the door to her room she said to Presbury--said it in a quiet, cold,\nterrible way:\n\n\"If you really want me to go through with this thing, you will stop\ninsulting him and me.  If you do it again, I'll give up--and go on the\nstreets before I'll marry him.\"\n\nPresbury shrugged his shoulders and went on to the other room.  But he\ndid not begin again the next day, and from that time forth avoided\nreference to the general.  In fact, there was an astonishing change in\nhis whole demeanor.  He ceased to bait his wife, became polite, even\naffable.  If he had conducted himself thus from the outset, he would\nhave got far less credit, would have made far less progress toward\nwinning the liking of his wife, and of her daughter, than he did in a\nbrief two weeks of change from petty and malignant tyrant to\ngood-natured, interestingly talkative old gentleman. After the manner\nof human nature, Mildred and her mother, in their relief, in their\npleasure through this amazing sudden and wholly unexpected geniality,\nnot merely forgave but forgot all they had suffered at his hands.\nMildred was not without a suspicion of the truth that this change,\ninaugurated in his own good time, was fresh evidence of his contempt\nfor both of them--of his feeling that he could easily make reparation\nwith a little kindness and decency and put himself in the way of\ngetting any possible benefits from the rich alliance.  But though she\npractically knew what was going on in his mind, she could not prevent\nherself from softening toward him.\n\nNow followed a succession of dinners, of theater- and opera-goings, of\nweek-ends at the general's new country palace in the fashionable region\nof Long Island. All these festivities were of the same formal and\ntedious character.  At all the general was the central sun with the\nothers dim and draggled satellites, hardly more important than the\nouter rim of satellite servants.  He did most of the talking; he was\nthe sole topic of conversation; for when he was not talking about\nhimself he wished to be hearing about himself.  If Mildred had not been\nseeing more and more plainly that other and real personality of his,\nher contempt for him and for herself would have grown beyond control.\nBut, with him or away from him, at every instant there was the sense of\nthat other real William Siddall--a shadowy menace full of terror.  She\ndreamed of it--was startled from sleep by visions of a monstrous and\nmighty distortion of the little general's grotesque exterior.  \"I shall\nmarry him if I can,\" she said to her self.  \"But--can I?\"  And she\nfeared and hoped that she could not, that courage would fail her, or\nwould come to her rescue, whichever it was, and that she would refuse\nhim.  Aside from the sense of her body that cannot but be with any\nwoman who is beautiful, she had never theretofore been especially\nphysical in thought.  That side of life had remained vague, as she had\nnever indulged in or even been strongly tempted with the things that\nrouse it from its virginal sleep. But now she thought only of her body,\nbecause that it was, and that alone, that had drawn this prospective\npurchaser, and his eyes never let her forget it.  She fell into the\nhabit of looking at herself in the glass--at her face, at her\nshoulders, at her whole person, not in vanity but in a kind of wonder\nor aversion.  And in the visions, both the waking and the sleeping, she\nreached the climax of horror when the monster touched her--with clammy,\ncreepy fingers, with munching lips, with the sharp ends of the mustache\nor imperial.\n\nSaid Mrs. Presbury to her husband, \"I'm afraid the general will be\nirritated by Mildred's unresponsiveness.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" replied Presbury.  \"He's so crazy about himself that he\nimagines the whole world is in the same state.\"\n\n\"Isn't it strange that he doesn't give her presents? Never anything but\ncandy and flowers.\"\n\n\"And he never will,\" said Presbury.\n\n\"Not until they're married, I suppose.\"\n\nPresbury was silent.\n\n\"I can't help thinking that if Milly were to rouse herself and show\nsome--some liking--or at least interest, it'd be wiser.\"\n\n\"She's taking the best possible course,\" said Presbury.  \"Unconsciously\nto both of them, she's leading him on.  He thinks that's the way a lady\nshould act--restrained, refined.\"\n\nMildred's attitude was simple inertia.  The most positive effort she\nmade was avoiding saying or doing anything to displease him--no\ndifficult matter, as she was silent and almost lifeless when he was\nnear.  Without any encouragement from her he gradually got a deep\nrespect for her--which meant that he became convinced of her coldness\nand exclusiveness, of her absolute trustworthiness.  Presbury was more\nprofoundly right than he knew.  The girl pursued the only course that\nmade possible the success she longed for, yet dreaded and loathed.  For\nat the outset Siddall had not been nearly so strongly in earnest in his\nmatrimonial project as he had professed and had believed himself.  He\nwished to marry, wished to add to his possessions the admirable\nshow-piece and exhibition opportunity afforded by the right sort of\nwife; but in the bottom of his heart he felt that such a woman as he\ndreamed of did not exist in all the foolish, fickle, and shallow female\nsex.  This girl--so cold, so proud, beautiful yet not eager to display\nher charms or to have them praised--she was the rare bird he sought.\n\nIn a month he asked her to marry him; that is, he said:  \"My dear, I\nfind that I am ready to go the limit--if you are.\"  And she assented.\nHe put his arm around her and kissed her cheek--and was delighted to\ndiscover that the alluring embrace made no impression upon the ice of\nher \"purity and ladylike dignity.\"  Up to the very last moment of the\nformal courtship he held himself ready to withdraw should she reveal to\nhis watchfulness the slightest sign of having any \"unladylike\"\ntendencies or feelings.  She revealed no such sign, but remained\n\"ladylike\"; and certainly, so the general reasoned, a woman who could\nthus resist him, even in the license of the formal engagement, would\nresist anybody.\n\nAs soon as the engagement was formally concluded, the general hurried\non the preparations for the wedding. He opened accounts at half a dozen\nshops in New York--dressmakers, milliners, dealers in fine and\nfashionable clothing of every kind--and gave them orders to execute\nwhatever commands Miss Gower or her mother--for HER--might give them.\nWhen he told her of this munificence and magnificence and paused for\nthe outburst of gratitude, he listened in vain. Mildred colored to the\nroots of her hair and was silent, was seeking the courage to refuse.\n\n\"I know that you and your people can't afford to do the thing as things\nrelated to me must be done,\" he went on to say.  \"So I decided to just\nstart in a little early at what I've got to do anyhow.  Not that I\nblame you for your not having money, my dear.  On the contrary, that's\none of your merits with me.  I wouldn't marry a woman with money.  It\nputs the family life on a wrong basis.\"\n\n\"I had planned a quiet wedding,\" said Mildred. \"I'd much prefer it.\"\n\n\"Now you can be frank with me, my dear,\" said the general.  \"I know you\nladies--how cheated you feel if you aren't married with all the frills\nand fixings. So that's the way it shall be done.\"\n\n\"Really,\" protested Mildred, \"I'm absolutely frank. I wish it to be\nquite quiet--in our drawing-room, with no guests.\"\n\nSiddall smiled, genial and tolerant.  \"Don't argue with me, my dear.  I\nknow what you want, and I'll see that you get it.  Go ahead with these\nshop-people I've put at your disposal--and go as far as you like. There\nisn't anything--ANYTHING--in the way of clothes that you can't\nhave--that you mustn't have. Mrs. General Siddall is going to be the\nbest-dressed woman in the world--as she is the prettiest.  I haven't\nopened an account for you with Tiffany's or any of those people.  I'll\nlook out for that part of the business, myself.\"\n\n\"I don't care for jewelry,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Naturally not for the kind that's been within your means heretofore,\"\nreplied he; \"but you'll open your eyes when you see MY jewelry for MY\nwife.  All in good time, my dear.  You and your mother must start right\nin with the shopping; and, a week or so before the wedding, I'll send\nmy people down to transform the house.  I may be wrong, but I rather\nthink that the Siddall wedding will cause some talk.\"\n\nHe was not wrong.  Through his confidential secretary, Harding the\nthorough, the newspaper press was induced to take an interest in the\nincredible extravagance Siddall was perpetrating in arranging for a\nfitting wedding for General William Siddall.  For many days before the\nceremony there were daily columns about him and his romantic career and\nhis romantic wooing of the New Jersey girl of excellent family and\nsocial position but of comparatively modest means. The shopkeepers gave\ninterviews on the trousseau.  The decorators and caterers detailed the\nsplendors and the costliness of the preparations of which they had\ncharge. From morning until dark a crowd hung round the house at Hanging\nRock, and on the wedding day the streets leading to it were\nblocked--chiefly with people come from a distance, many of them from\nNew York.\n\nAt the outset all this noise was deeply distasteful to Mildred, but\nafter a few days she recovered her normal point of view, forgot the\nkind of man she was marrying in the excitement and exultation over her\nsudden splendor and fame.  So strongly did the delusion presently\nbecome, that she was looking at the little general with anything but\nunfavorable eyes.  He seemed to her a quaint, fascinating, benevolent\nnecromancer, having miraculous powers which he was exercising in her\nbehalf. She even reproached herself with ingratitude in not being\nwildly in love with him.  Would not any other girl, in her place, have\nfallen over ears in love with this marvelous man?\n\nHowever, while she could not quite convince herself that she loved, she\nbecame convinced without effort that she was happy, that she was going\nto be still happier. The excitement wrought her into a state of\nexaltation and swept her through the wedding ceremony and the going\naway as radiant a bride as a man would care to have.\n\nThere is much to be said against the noisy, showy wedding.  Certainly\nlove has rarely been known to degrade himself to the point of attending\nany such.  But there is something to be said for that sort of married\nstart--for instance, where love is neither invited nor desired, an\neffort must be made to cover the painful vacancy his absence always\ncauses.\n\nThe little general's insistence on a \"real wedding\" was most happy for\nhim.  It probably got him his bride.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE intoxication of that wedding held on long enough and strongly\nenough to soften and blunt the disillusionments of the first few days\nof the honeymoon.  In the prospect that period had seemed, even to\nMildred's rather unsophisticated imagination, appalling beyond her\npower to endure.  In the fact--thanks in large part to that\nintoxication--it was certainly not unendurable.  A human being, even an\ninnocent young girl, can usually bear up under any experience to which\na human being can be subjected.  The general in pajamas--of the finest\nsilk and of pigeon's-egg blue with a vast gorgeous monogram on the\npocket--was more grotesque, rather than more repellent, than the\ngeneral in morning or evening attire.  Also he--that is, his expert\nstaff of providers of luxury--had arranged for the bride a series of\nthe most ravishing sensations in whisking her, like the heroine of an\nArabian Night's tale, from straitened circumstances to the very\nparadise of luxury.\n\nThe general's ideas on the subject of woman were old fashioned, of the\nhard-shell variety.  Woman was made for luxury, and luxury was made for\nwoman.  His woman must be the most divinely easeful of the luxurious.\nAt all times she must be fit and ready for any and every sybaritic idea\nthat might enter her husband's head--and other purpose she had none.\nWhen she was not directly engaged in ministering to his joy she must be\nbusy preparing herself for his next call upon her.  A woman was a\nluxury, was the luxury of luxuries, must have and must use to their\nuttermost all capacities for gratifying his senses and his vanity.\nAlone with him, she must make him constantly feel how rich and rare and\nexpensive a prize he had captured. When others were about, she must be\nconstantly making them envy and admire him for having exclusive rights\nin such wonderful preserves.  All this with an inflexible devotion to\nthe loftiest ideals of chastity.\n\nBut the first realizations of her husband's notions as to women were\naltogether pleasant.  As she entered the automobile in which they went\nto the private car in the special train that took them to New York and\nthe steamer--as she entered that new and prodigally luxurious\nautomobile, she had a first, keen sense of her changed position.  Then\nthere was the superb private car--her car, since she was his wife--and\nthere was the beautiful suite in the magnificent steamer.  And at every\ninstant menials thrusting attentions upon her, addressing her as if she\nwere a queen, revealing in their nervous tones and anxious eyes their\neagerness to please, their fear of displeasing.  And on the steamer,\nfrom New York to Cherbourg, she was never permitted to lose sight of\nthe material splendors that were now hers. All the servants, all the\npassengers, reminded her by their looks, their tones.  At Paris, in the\nhotel, in the restaurants, in the shops--especially in the shops--those\nsnobbish instincts that are latent in the sanest and the wisest of us\nwere fed and fattened and pampered until her head was quite turned.\nAnd the general began to buy jewels for her.  Such jewels--ropes of\ndiamonds and pearls and emeralds, rings such as she had never dreamed\nexisted!  Those shopping excursions of theirs in the Rue de la Paix\nwould make such a tale as your ordinary simple citizen, ignorant of the\nworld's resources in luxury and therefore incredulous about them, would\nread with a laugh at the extravagance of the teller.\n\nBefore the intoxication of the wedding had worn away it was re-enforced\nby the intoxication of the honeymoon--not an intoxication of love's\nproviding, but one exceeding potent in its influence upon our weak\nhuman brains and hearts, one from which the strongest of us, instead of\nsneering at poor Mildred, would better be praying to be delivered.\n\nAt her marriage she had a few hundred dollars left of her\npatrimony--three hundred and fifty and odd, to be more exact.  She\nspent a little money of her own here and there--in tips, in buying\npresents for her mother, in picking up trifles for her own toilet.  The\nday came when she looked in her purse and found two one-franc pieces, a\nfifty-franc note, and a few coppers. And suddenly she sat back and\nstared, her mouth open like her almost empty gold bag, which the\ngeneral had bought her on their first day in the Rue de la Paix. About\nten dollars in all the world, and the general had forgotten to\nspeak--or to make any arrangement, at least any arrangement of which\nshe was aware--about a further supply of money.\n\nThey had been married nearly a month.  He knew that she was poor.  Why\nhadn't he said something or, better still, DONE something?  Doubtless\nhe had simply forgotten.  But since he had forgotten for a month, might\nhe not continue to forget?  True, he had himself been poor at one time\nin his life, very poor, and that for a long time.  But it had been so\nmany years ago that he had probably lost all sense of the meaning of\npoverty.  She frowned at this evidence of his lack of the finer\nsensibilities--by no means the first time that lack had been\ndisagreeably thrust upon her.  Soon she would be without money--and she\nmust have money--not much, as all the serious expenses were looked\nafter by the general, but still a little money.  How could she get it?\nHow could she remind him of his neglect without seeming to be\nindelicate?  It was a difficult problem.  She worked at it more and\nmore continuously, and irritably, and nervously, as the days went by\nand her fifty-two francs dwindled to five.\n\nShe lay awake, planning long and elaborate conversations that would\nimperceptibly lead him up to where he must see what she needed without\nseeing that he had been led.  She carried out these ingenious\nconversations. She led him along, he docilely and unsuspectingly\nfollowing.  She brought him up to where it seemed to her impossible for\nany human being endowed with the ordinary faculties to fail to see what\nwas so plainly in view.  All in vain.  General William Siddall gazed\nplacidly--and saw nothing.\n\nSeveral days of these failures, and with her funds reduced to a\nfifty-centime piece and a two-sous copper she made a frontal attack.\nWhen they went forth for the day's shopping she left her gold bag\nbehind.  After an hour or so she said:\n\n\"I've got to go to the Galleries Lafayette for some little things.  I\nshan't ask you to sacrifice yourself.  I know you hate those stuffy,\nsmelly big shops.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said he.  \"I'll use the time in a call on my bankers.\"\n\nAs they were about to separate, she taking the motor and he walking,\nshe made a face of charming dismay and said:  \"How provoking!  I've\nleft my bag at the hotel.\"\n\nInstead of the expected prompt offer of money he said, \"It'll only take\nyou a minute or so to drive there.\"\n\n\"But it's out of the way,\" she replied.  \"I'll need only a hundred\nfrancs or so.\"\n\nSaid he:  \"I've an account at the Bon Marche.  Go there and have the\nthings charged.  It's much the best big shop in Paris.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" was all she could trust herself to say. She concealed her\nanger beneath a careless smile and drove away.  How dense he was! Could\nanything be more exasperating--or more disagreeable?  What SHOULD she\ndo?  The situation was intolerable; yet how could it be ended, except\nby a humiliating direct request for money?  She wondered how young\nwives habitually dealt with this problem, when they happened to marry\nhusbands so negligent, not to say underbred, as to cause them the\nawkwardness and the shame.  There followed several days during which\nthe money idea was an obsession, nagging and grinning at her every\ninstant.  The sight of money gave her a peculiar itching sensation.\nWhen the little general paid for anything--always drawing out a great\nsheaf of bank notes in doing it--she flushed hot and cold, her glance\nfell guiltily and sought the money furtively.  At last her desperation\ngave birth to an inspiration.\n\nAbout her and the general, or, rather, about the general, revolved the\nusual rich man's small army of satellites of various\ndegrees--secretaries, butlers, footmen, valets, other servants male and\nfemale, some of them supposed to be devoted entirely to her service,\nbut all in fact looking ever to the little general.  The members of\nthis company, regardless of differences of rank and pay, were banded\ntogether in a sort of democratic fellowship, talking freely with one\nanother, on terms of perfect equality.  She herself had, curiously,\ngotten on excellent terms with this motley fraternity and found no\nsmall relief from the strain of the general's formal dignity in talking\nwith them with a freedom and ease she had never before felt in the\nsociety of underlings. The most conspicuous and most agreeable figure\nin this company was Harding, the general's factotum.  Why not lay the\ncase before Harding?  He was notably sensible, and sympathetic--and\ndiscreet.\n\nThe following day she did so.  Said she, blushing furiously:  \"Mr.\nHarding, I find myself in a very embarrassing position.  I wonder if\nyou can help me?\"\n\nHarding, a young man and of one of the best blond types, said:  \"No\ndoubt I can--and I'll be glad to.\"\n\n\"The fact is\"--  Her voice was trembling with nervousness.  She opened\nthe gold bag, took out the little silver pieces and the big copper\npiece, extended her pink palm with them upon it--\"there's all I've got\nleft of the money I brought with me.\"\n\nHarding gazed at the exhibit tranquilly.  He was chiefly remarkable for\nhis perfect self-possession.  Said he:  \"Do you wish me to cash a check\nfor you?\"\n\nThe stupidity of men!  Tears of vexation gathered in her eyes.  When\nshe could speak she faltered:\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHe was looking at her now--a grave, kind glance.\n\nShe somehow felt encouraged and heartened.  She went on:  \"I was\nhoping--that--that the gen--that my husband had said something to you\nand that you perhaps had not thought to say anything to me.\"\n\nTheir glances met, his movingly sympathetic and understanding, hers\npiteously forlorn--the look of a lovely girl, stranded and friendless\nin a far strange land.  Presently he said gently:\n\n\"Yes, he told me to say something to you--if you should speak to me\nabout this matter.\"  His tone caused in her heart a horrible stillness\nof suspense.  He went on:  \"He said--I give you his exact words: 'If my\nwife should ask you for money, tell her my ideas on the subject.'\"\n\nA pause.  She started up, crimson, her glance darting nervously this\nway and that to avoid his.  \"Never mind.  Really, it's of no\nimportance.  Thank you--I'll get on very well--I'm sorry to have\ntroubled you--\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Mrs. Siddall,\" he interposed, \"but I think you'd best let\nme finish.\"\n\nShe started to protest, she tried to move toward the door.  Her\nstrength failed her, she sat down, waited, nervously clasping and\nunclasping the costly, jewel-embroidered bag.\n\n\"He has explained to me, many times,\" continued Harding, \"that he\nbelieves women do not understand the value of money and ought not to be\ntrusted with it. He proposes to provide everything for you, every\ncomfort and luxury--I am using his own language, Mrs. Siddall--and he\nhas open accounts at the principal shops in every city where you will\ngo--New York, Washington, Chicago, Denver, Paris, London, Rome. He says\nyou are at liberty to get practically anything you please at these\nshops, and he will pay the bills. He thus entirely spares you the\nnecessity of ever spending any money.  Should you see anything you wish\nat some shop where he has no account, you can have it sent collect, and\nI or my assistant, Mr. Drawl, will settle for it.  All he asks is that\nyou use discretion in this freedom.  He says it would be extremely\npainful to him to have to withdraw it.\"\n\nHarding had pronounced this long speech in a dry monotonous voice, like\none reading mechanically from a dull book.  As Mildred listened, her\nthoughts began to whirl about the central idea until she fell into a\nkind of stupor.  When he finished she was staring vacantly at the bag\nin her lap--the bag she was holding open wide.\n\nHarding continued:  \"He also instructed me to say something about his\nformer--his experiences.  The first Mrs. Siddall he married when he was\nvery young and poor.  As he grew rich, she became madly extravagant.\nAnd as they had started on a basis on which she had free access to his\nmoney he could not check her. The result, finally, was a succession of\nbitter quarrels, and they were about to divorce when she died.  He made\nthe second Mrs. Siddall an allowance, a liberal allowance.  Her follies\ncompelled him to withdraw it. She resorted to underhanded means to get\nmoney from him without his knowing it.  He detected the fraud. After a\nseries of disagreeable incidents she committed the indiscretion which\ncaused him to divorce her.  He says that these experiences have\nconvinced him that--\"\n\n\"The second Mrs. Siddall,\" interrupted Mildred, \"is she still alive?\"\n\nHarding hesitated.  \"Yes,\" he said reluctantly.\n\n\"Is she--poor?\" asked Mildred.\n\n\"I should prefer not to--\"\n\n\"Did the general forbid you to tell me?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, he instructed me--  But I'd rather not talk about it,\nMrs. Siddall.\"\n\n\"Is she poor?\" repeated Mildred.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What became of her?\"\n\nA long pause.  Then Harding said:  \"She was a poor girl when the\ngeneral married her.  After the divorce she lived for a while with the\nman.  But he had nothing.  They separated.  She tried various kinds of\nwork--and other things.  Since she lost her looks--  She writes from\ntime to time, asking for money.\"\n\n\"Which she never gets?\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Which she never gets,\" said Harding.  \"Lately she was cashier or head\nwaitress in a cheap restaurant in St. Louis.\"\n\nAfter a long silence Mildred said:  \"I understand. I understand.\"  She\ndrew a long breath.  \"I shall understand better as time goes on, but I\nunderstand fairly well now.\"\n\n\"I need not tell you, Mrs. Siddall,\" said Harding in his gentle,\ntranquil way, \"that the general is the kindest and most generous of\nmen, but he has his own methods--as who has not?\"\n\nMildred had forgotten that he was there--not a difficult matter, when\nhe had in its perfection the secretarial manner of complete\nself-effacement.  Said she reflectively, like one puzzling out a\ndifficult problem:\n\n\"He buys a woman, as he buys a dog or a horse. He does not give his\ndog, his horse, pocket-money. Why should he give his woman\npocket-money?\"\n\n\"Will it help matters, Mrs. Siddall, to go to the other extreme and do\nhim a grave injustice?\"\n\nShe did not hear.  At the picture presented to her mind by her own\nthoughts she gave a short satirical laugh.  \"How stupid of me not to\nhave understood from the outset,\" said she.  \"Why, I've often heard of\nthis very thing.\"\n\n\"It is more and more the custom among men of large property, I\nbelieve,\" said Harding.  \"Perhaps, Mrs. Siddall, you would not blame\nthem if you were in their position.  The rich men who are\ncareless--they ruin everybody about them, I assure you.  I've seen it\nagain and again.\"\n\nBut the young wife was absorbed in her own thoughts.  Harding, feeling\nher mood, did not interrupt. After a while she said:\n\n\"I must ask you some questions.  These jewels the general has been\nbuying--\"\n\nHarding made a movement of embarrassment and protest.  She smiled\nironically and went on:\n\n\"One moment, please.  Every time I wish to wear any of them I have to\ngo to him to get them.  He asks me to return them when I am undressing.\nHe says it is safer to keep everything in his strong box.  I have been\nassuming that that was the only reason.  I begin to suspect--  Am I\nright, Mr. Harding?\"\n\n\"Really I can't say, Mrs. Siddall,\" said Harding. \"These are not\nmatters to discuss with me, if you will permit me to say so.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, they are,\" replied she laughingly. \"Aren't we all in the same\nboat?--all employes of the general?\"\n\nHarding made no reply.\n\nMildred was beside herself with a kind of rage that, because outlet was\nnecessary and because raving against the little general would be\nabsolutely futile, found outlet in self-mockery and reckless sarcasm.\n\n\"I understand about the jewels, too,\" she went on. \"They are not mine.\nNothing is mine.  Everything, including myself, belongs to him.  If I\ngive satisfaction in the position for which I've been hired for my\nboard and clothes, I may continue to eat the general's food and sleep\nin the general's house and wear the general's jewels and dresses and\nride in the general's traps and be waited on by the general's servants.\nIf I don't like my place or he doesn't like my way of filling it\"--she\nlaughed merrily, mockingly--\"out I go--into the streets--after the\nsecond Mrs. Siddall.  And the general will hire a new--\"  She paused,\ncast about for a word in vain, appealed to the secretary, \"What would\nyou call it, Mr. Harding?\"\n\nHarding rose, looking at her with a very soothing tranquillity.  \"If I\nwere you, Mrs. Siddall,\" said he, \"I should get into the auto and go\nfor a long drive--out to the Bois--out to Versailles--a long, long\ndrive.  I should be gone four or five hours at least, and I should look\nat the thing from all sides.  Especially, I'd look at it from HIS\nstandpoint.\"\n\nMildred, somewhat quieter, but still mocking, said: \"If I should decide\nto quit, would my expenses be paid back to where I was engaged?  I\nfancy not.\"\n\nHarding looked grave.  \"If you had had money enough to pay your own\nexpenses about, would you have married him?\" said he.  \"Isn't he\npaying--paying liberally, Mrs. Siddall--for ALL he gets?\"\n\nMildred, stung, drew herself up haughtily, gave him a look that\nreminded him who she was and who he was. But Harding was not impressed.\n\n\"You said a moment ago--truly--that we are all in the same boat,\"\nobserved he.  \"I put those questions to you because I honestly wish to\nhelp you--because I wish you not to act foolishly, hastily.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Harding,\" said Mildred coldly. And with a slight nod\nshe went, angry and ashamed that she had so unaccountably opened up her\nsecret soul, bared its ugly wounds, before a man she knew so slightly,\na man in a position but one remove from menial.  However, she took his\nadvice--not as to trying to view the matter from all sides, for she was\nconvinced that there was only the one side, but as to calming herself\nby a long drive alone in the woods and along quiet roads.  When she\nreturned she was under control once more.\n\nShe found the general impatiently awaiting her. Many packages had\ncome--from the jewelers, from the furriers, from a shop whose specialty\nwas the thinnest and most delicate of hand-made underwear.  The general\nloved to open and inspect finery for her--loved it more than he loved\ninspecting finery for himself, because feminine finery was far more\nattractive than masculine.  To whet his pleasure to the keenest she\nmust be there to admire with him, to try on, to exhibit.  As she\nentered the salon where the little man was fussing about among the\npackages, their glances met.  She saw that Harding had told him--at\nleast in discreet outline--of their conversation.  She also saw that if\nshe reopened the subject she would find herself straightway whirled out\nupon a stormy sea of danger that might easily overwhelm her flimsy\nboat.  She silently and sullenly dropped into her place; she ministered\nto the general's pleasure in packages of finery. But she did not\nexclaim, or admire, or respond in any way.  The honeymoon was over. Her\ndream of wifehood was dissipated.\n\nShe understood now the look she so often had seen on the faces of rich\nmen's poor wives driving in state in Fifth Avenue.  That night, as she\ninspected herself in the glass while the general's maid for her brushed\nher long thick hair, she saw the beginnings of that look in her own\nface.  \"I don't know just what I am,\" she said to herself.  \"But I do\nknow what I am not.  I am not a wife.\"\n\nShe sent away the maid, and sat there in the dressing-room before the\nmirror, waiting, her glance traveling about and noting the profuse and\nprodigal luxury.  In the corner stood a circular rack loaded with\ndressing-gowns--more than a score of exquisite combinations of silk and\nlace or silk and chiffon.  It so happened that there was nowhere in\nsight a single article of her apparel or for her toilet that was not\nbought with the general's money.  No, there were some hairpins that she\nhad paid for herself, and a comb with widely separated teeth that she\nhad chanced to see in a window when she was alone one day.  Anything\nelse? Yes, a two-franc box of pins.  And that was all. Everything else\nbelonged to the general.  In the closets, in the trunks--all the\ngeneral's, part of the trousseau he had paid for.  Not an undergarment;\nnot an outer garment; not a hat or a pair of shoes, not a wrap, not a\npair of gloves.  All, the general's.\n\nHe was in the door of the dressing-room--the small wiry figure in\nrose-silk pajamas.  The mustache and imperial were carefully waxed as\nalways, day and night. On the little feet were high-heeled slippers. On\nthe head was a rose-silk Neapolitan nightcap with gay tassel. The\nnightcap hid the bald spot from which the lofty toupee had been\nremoved.  A grotesque little figure, but not grotesque to her.  Through\nthe mask of the vain, boastful little face she saw the general watching\nher, as she had seen him that afternoon when she came in--the\nmysterious and terrible personality that had made the vast fortune,\nthat had ridden ruthlessly over friend and foe, over man and woman and\nchild--to the goal of its desires.\n\n\"It's late, my dear?\" said the little man.  \"Come to bed.\"\n\nShe rose to obey--she in the general's purchases of filmy nightgown\nunder a pale-pink silk dressing-gown.\n\nHe smiled with that curious noiseless mumbling and smacking of the thin\nlips.  She sat down again.\n\n\"Don't keep me waiting.  It's chilly,\" he said, advancing toward her.\n\n\"I shall sleep in here to-night--on the couch,\" said she.  She was\ntrembling with fright at her own audacity. She could see a\nfifty-centime piece and a copper dancing before her eyes.  She felt\nhorribly alone and weak, but she had no desire to retract the words\nwith which she had thrown down the gauntlet.\n\nThe little general halted.  The mask dropped; the man, the monster,\nlooked at her.  \"What's the matter?\" said he in an ominously quiet\nvoice.\n\n\"Mr. Harding delivered your message to-day,\" said she, and her steady\nvoice astonished her.  \"So I am going back home.\"\n\nHe waited, looking steadily at her.\n\n\"After he told me and I thought about it, I decided to submit, but just\nnow I saw that I couldn't.  I don't know what possesses me.  I don't\nknow what I'm going to do, or how I'm going to do it.  But it's all\nover between us.\"  She said this rapidly, fluently, in a decisive way,\nquite foreign to her character as she had thought it.\n\n\"You are coming to bed, where you belong,\" said he quietly.\n\n\"No,\" replied she, pressing herself against her chair as if force were\nbeing used to drag her from it.  She cast about for something that\nwould make yielding impossible.  \"You are--repulsive to me.\"\n\nHe looked at her without change of countenance. Said he:  \"Come to bed.\nI ask you for the last time.\"\n\nThere was no anger in his voice, no menace either open or covert;\nsimply finality--the last word of the man who had made himself feared\nand secure in the mining-camps where the equation of personal courage\nis straightway applied to every situation.  Mildred shivered.  She\nlonged to yield, to stammer out some excuse and obey him.  But she\ncould not; nor was she able to rise from her chair.  She saw in his\nhard eyes a look of astonishment, of curiosity as to this unaccountable\ndefiance in one who had seemed docile, who had apparently no\nalternative but obedience.  He was not so astonished at her as she was\nat herself.  \"What is to become of me?\" her terror-stricken soul was\ncrying. \"I must do as he says--I must--yet I cannot!\" And she looked at\nhim and sat motionless.\n\nHe turned away, moved slowly toward the door, halted at the threshold\nto give her time, was gone.  A fit of trembling seized her; she leaned\nforward and rested her arms upon the dressing-table or she would have\nfallen from the chair to the floor.  Yet, even as her fear made her\nsick and weak, she knew that she would not yield.\n\nThe cold drove her to the couch, to lie under half a dozen of the\ndressing-gowns and presently to fall into a sleep of exhaustion.  When\nshe awoke after what she thought was a few minutes of unconsciousness,\nthe clamor of traffic in the Rue de Rivoli startled her.  She started\nup, glanced at the clock on the chimneypiece. It was ten minutes past\nnine!  When, by all the rules governing the action of the nerves, she\nought to have passed a wakeful night she had overslept more than an\nhour.  Indeed, she had had the first sound and prolonged sleep that had\ncome to her since the honeymoon began; for until then she had slept\nalone all her life and the new order had almost given her chronic\ninsomnia. She rang for her maid and began to dress.  The maid did not\ncome.  She rang again and again; apparently the bell was broken.  She\nfinished dressing and went out into the huge, grandly and gaudily\nfurnished salon.  Harding was at a carved old-gold and lacquer desk,\nwriting.  As she entered he rose and bowed.\n\n\"Won't you please call one of the servants?\" said she.  \"I want my\ncoffee.  I guess the bell in my room is broken.  My maid doesn't\nanswer.\"\n\n\"No, the bell is not broken,\" said Harding.\n\nShe looked at him questioningly.\n\n\"The general has issued an order that nothing is to be done in this\napartment, and nothing served, unless he personally authorizes it.\"\n\nMildred paled, drew herself up in what seemed a gesture of haughtiness\nbut was an effort to muster her strength.  To save herself from the\nhumiliation of a breakdown before him, she hastily retreated by the way\nshe had come.  After perhaps a quarter of an hour she reappeared in the\nsalon; she was now dressed for the street.  Harding looked up from his\nwriting, rose and bowed gravely.  Said she:\n\n\"I am going out for a walk.  I'll be back in an hour or so.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" said Harding, halting her as she was opening the door\ninto the public hall.  \"The general has issued an order that if you go\nout, you are not to be allowed to return.\"\n\nHer hand fell from the knob.  With flashing eyes she cried, \"But that\nis impossible!\"\n\n\"It is his orders,\" said Harding, in his usual quiet manner.  \"And as\nhe pays the bills he will be obeyed.\"\n\nShe debated.  Against her will, her trembling hand sought the knob\nagain.  Against her will, her weak arm began to draw the door open.\nHarding came toward her, stood before her and looked directly into her\neyes. His eyes had dread and entreaty in them, but his voice was as\nalways when he said:\n\n\"You know him, Mrs. Siddall.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\n\"The reason he has got ALL he wanted--whatever he wanted--is that he\nwill go to any length.  Every other human being, almost, has a limit,\nbeyond which they will not go--a physical fear or a moral fear or a\nfear of public opinion.  But the general--he has no limit.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.  And deathly pale and almost staggering she drew open\nthe door and went out into the public hall.\n\n\"For God's sake, Mrs. Siddall!\" cried Harding, in great agitation.\n\"Come in quickly.  They are watching--they will tell him!  Are you mad?\"\n\n\"I think I must be,\" said she.  \"I am sick with fear. I can hardly keep\nfrom dropping down here in a faint. Yet--\" a strange look, a mingling\nof abject terror and passionate defiance, gave her an aspect quite\ninsane--\"I am going.  Perhaps I, too, have no limit.\"\n\nAnd she went along the corridor, past a group of gaping and frightened\nservants, down the stairway and out by the private entrance for the\ngrand apartments of the hotel in the Rue Raymond de l'Isle.  She\ncrossed the Rue de Rivoli and entered the Tuileries Gardens. It was\nonly bracingly cool in the sunshine of that winter day.  She seated\nherself on a chair on the terrace to regain her ebbed strength.  Hardly\nhad she sat down when the woman collector came and stood waiting for\nthe two sous for the chair.  Mildred opened her bag, found two coins.\nShe gave the coppers to the woman.  The other--all the money she\nhad--was the fifty-centime piece.\n\n\"But the bag--I can get a good deal for that,\" she said aloud.\n\n\"I beg your pardon--I didn't catch that.\"\n\nShe came back to a sense of her surroundings.  Stanley Baird was\nstanding a few feet away, smiling down at her.  He was, if possible,\neven more attractively dressed than in the days when he hovered about\nher, hoping vague things of which he was ashamed and trying to get the\ncourage to put down his snobbishness and marry her because she so\nexactly suited him.  He was wearing a new kind of collar and tie,\nstriking yet in excellent quiet taste.  Also, his face and figure had\nfilled out just enough--he had been too thin in the former days.  But\nhe was now entered upon that period of the fearsome forties when,\nunless a man amounts to something, he begins to look insignificant.  He\ndid not amount to anything; he was therefore paling and waning as a\npersonality.\n\n\"Was I thinking aloud?\" said Mildred, as she gave him her hand.\n\n\"You said something about 'getting a good deal.'\" He inspected her with\nthe freedom of an old friend and with the thoroughness of a\nconnoisseur.  Women who took pains with themselves and were satisfied\nwith the results liked Stanley Baird's knowing and appreciative way of\nnoting the best points in their toilets.  \"You're looking fine,\"\ndeclared he.  \"It must be a pleasure to them up in the Rue de la Paix\nto dress you.  That's more than can be said for nine out of ten of the\nwomen who go there.  Yes, you're looking fine--and in grand health,\ntoo.  Why, you look younger than I ever saw you.  Nothing like marriage\nto freshen a girl up. Well, I suppose waiting round for a husband who\nmay or may not turn up does wear a woman down.\"\n\n\"It almost killed me,\" laughed Mildred.  \"And you were largely\nresponsible.\"\n\n\"I?\" said Baird.  \"You didn't want me.  I was too old for you.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't want you,\" said Mildred.  \"But you spoiled me.  I\ncouldn't endure the boys of my own age.\"\n\nStanley was remembering that Mildred had married a man much older than\nhe.  With some notion of a careless sort of tact in mind he said, \"I\nwas betwixt and between--neither young enough nor old enough.\"\n\n\"You've married, too, since we met.  By the way, thank you again for\nthat charming remembrance. You always did have such good taste.  But\nwhy didn't you come to the wedding--you and your wife?\"\n\nHe laughed.  \"We were busy busting up,\" said he. \"You hadn't heard?\nIt's been in the papers.  She's gone back to her people.  Oh, nothing\ndisgraceful on either side.  Simply that we bored each other to death.\nShe was crazy about horses and dogs, and that set.  I think the\nstable's the place for horses--don't care to have 'em parading through\nthe house all the time, every room, every meal, sleeping and waking.\nAnd dogs--the infernal brutes always have fleas.  Fleas only tickled\nher, but they bite me--raise welts and hills.  There's your husband\nnow, isn't it?\"\n\nBaird was looking up at the windows of the Continental, across the\nstreet.  Mildred's glance slowly and carelessly followed his.  At one\nwindow stood the little general, gazing abstractedly out over the\ngardens.  At another window Mildred saw Harding; at a third, her maid;\nat a fourth, Harding's assistant, Drawl; at a fifth, three servants of\nthe retinue.  Except the general, all were looking at her.\n\n\"You've married a very extraordinary man,\" said Baird, in a correct\ntone of admiration.  \"One of the ablest and most interesting men we've\ngot, _I_ think.\"\n\n\"So you are free again?\" said Mildred, looking at him with a queer,\ncold smile.\n\n\"Yes, and no,\" replied Stanley.  \"I hope to be entirely free.  It's her\nmove next.  I'm expecting it every day.  But I'm thoroughly\nrespectable.  Won't you and the general dine with me?\"\n\n\"Thanks, but I'm sailing for home to-morrow or next day.\"\n\n\"That's interesting,\" said Baird, with enthusiasm. \"So am I.  What ship\ndo you go on?\"\n\n\"I don't know yet.  I'm to decide this afternoon, after lunch.\"  She\nlaughed.  \"I'm sitting here waiting for someone to ask me to lunch.\nI've not had even coffee yet.\"\n\n\"Lunch with me!\" cried Baird.  \"I'll go get the general--I know him\nslightly.\"\n\n\"I didn't say anything about the general,\" said Mildred.\n\nStanley smiled apologetically.  \"It wouldn't do for you to go about\nwith me--not when my missus is looking for grounds for divorce.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Mildred.  \"So's my husband.\"\n\n\"You busted up, too?  Now, that's what _I_ call jolly.\"  And he cast a\npuzzled glance up at the abstracted general.  \"I say, Mildred, this is\nno place for either of us, is it?\"\n\n\"I'd rather be where there's food,\" confessed she.\n\n\"You think it's a joke, but I assure you--  Oh, you WERE joking--about\nYOUR bust-up?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" she assured him.  \"I walked out a while ago, and I\ncouldn't go back if I would--and I don't think I would if I could.\"\n\n\"That's foolish.  Better go back,\" advised he.  He was preparing\nhastily to decamp from so perilous a neighborhood.  \"One marriage is\nabout like another, once you get through the surface.  I'm sure you'll\nbe better off than--back with your stepfather.\"\n\n\"I've no intention of going to his house,\" she declared. \"Oh, there's\nyour brother.  I forgot.\"\n\n\"So had I forgotten him.  I'll not go there, either. In fact, I've not\nthought where I'll go.\"\n\n\"You seem to have done mighty little thinking before you took a very\nserious step for a woman.\"  He was uneasily eying the rigid, abstracted\nlittle figure a story up across the way.\n\n\"Those things aren't a question of thinking,\" said she absently.  \"I\nnever thought in my life--don't think I could if I tried.  But when the\ntime came I--I walked out.\"  She came back to herself, laughed. \"I\ndon't understand why I'm telling you all this, especially as you're mad\nwith fright and wild to get away. Well, good-by, Stanley.\"\n\nHe lifted his hat.  \"Good-by.  We'll meet when we can do so without my\ngetting a scandal on you.\"  He walked a few paces, turned, and came\nback.  \"By the way, I'm sailing on the Deutschland.  I thought you'd\nlike to know--so that you and I wouldn't by any chance cross on the\nsame boat.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said she dryly.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked he, arrested, despite his anxiety to be\ngone, by the sad, scornful look in her eyes.\n\n\"Nothing.  Why?\"\n\n\"You had such a--such a queer look.\"\n\n\"Really?  Good-by.\"\n\nIn fact, she had thought--had hoped for the sake of her liking for\nhim--that he had come back to make the glaringly omitted offer of help\nthat should have come from any human being learning that a fellow being\nwas in the precarious position in which she had told him she was.  Not\nthat she would have accepted any such offer.  Still, she would have\nliked to have heard the kindly words.  She sat watching his handsome,\ngraceful figure, draped in the most artistically cut of long dark\novercoats, until he disappeared in the crowd in the Rue de Castiglione.\nThen, without a glance up at the interested, not to say excited windows\nof the general's splendid and spreading apartments, she strolled down\nthe gardens toward the Place Concorde. In Paris the beautiful, on a\nbright and brisk day it is all but impossible to despair when one still\nhas left youth and health.  Mildred was not happy--far from it.  The\nfuture, the immediate future, pressed its terrors upon her.  But in\nmitigation there was, perhaps born of youth and inexperience, a giddy\nsense of relief. She had not realized how abhorrent the general\nwas--married life with the general.  She had been resigning herself to\nit, accepting it as the only thing possible, keeping it heavily draped\nwith her vanities of wealth and luxury--until she discovered that the\nwealth and the luxury were in reality no more hers than they were her\nmaid's. And now she was free!\n\nThat word free did not have its full meaning for her. She had never\nknown what real freedom was; women of the comfortable class--and men,\ntoo, for that matter--usually are born into the petty slavery of\nconventions at least, and know nothing else their whole lives\nthrough--never know the joy of the thought and the act of a free mind\nand a free heart.  Still, she was released from a bondage that seemed\nslavish even to her, and the release gave her a sensation akin to the\njoy of freedom.  A heavy hand that was crushing her very soul had been\nlifted off--no, FLUNG off, and by herself. That thought, terrifying\nthough it was, also gave her a certain new and exalting self-respect.\nAfter all, she was not a worm.  She must have somewhere in her the\ngerms of something less contemptible than the essential character of so\nmany of the eminently respectable women she knew.  She could picture\nthem in the situation in which she had found herself.  What would they\nhave done?  Why, what every instinct of her education impelled her to\ndo; what some latent love of freedom, some unsuspected courage of\nself-respect had forbidden her to do, had withheld her from doing.\n\nHer thoughts and the gorgeous sunshine and her youth and health put her\nin a steadily less cheerless mood as by a roundabout way she sought the\nshop of the jeweler who sold the general the gold bag she had selected.\nThe proprietor himself was in the front part of the shop and received\n\"Madame la Generale\" with all the honors of her husband's wealth.  She\nbrought no experience and no natural trading talent to the enterprise\nshe was about to undertake; so she went directly to the main point.\n\n\"This bag,\" said she, laying it upon the glass between them, \"I bought\nit here a short time ago.\"\n\n\"I remember perfectly, madame.  It is the handsomest, the most\nartistic, we have sold this year.\"\n\n\"I wish to sell it back to you,\" said she.\n\n\"You wish to get something else and include it as part payment, madame?\"\n\n\"No, I wish to get the money for it.\"\n\n\"Ah, but that is difficult.  We do not often make those arrangements.\nSecond-hand articles--\"\n\n\"But the bag is quite new.  Anyhow, it must have some value.  Of course\nI'd not expect the full price.\"\n\nThe jeweler smiled.  \"The full price?  Ah, madame, we should not think\nof offering it again as it is. We should--\"\n\n\"No matter,\" interrupted Mildred.  The man's expression--the normally\npleasant and agreeable countenance turned to repulsive by craft and\nlying--made her eager to be gone.  \"What is the most you will give me?\"\n\n\"I shall have to consider--\"\n\n\"I've only a few minutes.  Please do not irritate me.\"\n\nThe man was studying her countenance with a desperate look.  Why was\nshe, the bride of the monstrously rich American, why was she trying to\nsell the bag?  Did it mean the end of her resources?  Or, were there\nstill huge orders to be got from her?  His shrewdness, trained by\nthirty years of dealing with all kinds of luxurious human beings, went\nexploring in vain.  He was alarmed by her frown.  He began hesitatingly:\n\n\"The jewels and the gold are only a small part of the value.  The chief\nvalue is the unique design, so elegant yet so simple.  For the jewels\nand the gold, perhaps two thousand francs--\"\n\n\"The purse was twelve thousand francs,\" interrupted she.\n\n\"Perfectly, madame.  But--\" \"I am in great haste.  How much will you\ngive me?\"\n\n\"The most would be four thousand, I fear.  I shall count up more\ncarefully, if madame will--\"\n\n\"No, four thousand will do.\"\n\n\"I will send the money to madame at her hotel.  The Continental, is it\nnot?\"\n\n\"No, I must have it at once.\"\n\nThe jeweler hesitated.  Mildred, flushing scarlet with shame--but he\nluckily thought it anger--took up the bag and moved toward the door.\n\n\"Pardon, madame, but certainly.  Do you wish some gold or all notes?\"\n\n\"Notes,\" answered she.  \"Fifty and hundred-franc notes.\"\n\nA moment later she was in the street with the notes in a small bundle\nin the bosom of her wrap.  She went hurriedly up the street.  As she\nwas about to turn the corner into the boulevard she on impulse glanced\nback. An automobile had just drawn up at the jeweler's door and General\nSiddall--top-hat, sable-lined overcoat, waxed mustache and imperial,\nhigh-heeled boots, gold-mounted cane--was descending.  And she knew\nthat he had awakened to his one oversight, and was on his way to repair\nit.  But she did not know that the jeweler--old and wise in human\nways--would hastily vanish with the bag and that an assistant would\ncome forward with assurances that madame had not been in the shop and\nthat, if she should come in, no business would be negotiated without\nthe general's express consent.  She all but fainted at the narrowness\nof her escape and fled round into the boulevard.  She entered a taxi\nand told the man to drive to Foyot's restaurant on the left bank--where\nthe general would never think of looking for her.\n\nWhen she had breakfasted she strolled in the Luxembourg Gardens, in\neven better humor with herself and with the world.  There was still\nthat horrid-faced future, but it was not leering into her very face. It\nwas nearly four thousand francs away--\"and if I hadn't been so stupid,\nI'd have got eight thousand, I'm sure,\" she said.  But she was rather\nproud of a stupidity about money matters.  And four thousand francs,\neight hundred dollars--that was quite a good sum.\n\nShe had an instinct that the general would do something disagreeable\nabout the French and English ports of departure for America.  But\nperhaps he would not think of the Italian ports.  That night she set\nout for Genoa, and three days later, in a different dress and with her\nhair done as she never wore it, sailed as Miss Mary Stevens for America\non a German Mediterranean boat.\n\nShe had taken the whole of a cabin on the quieter deck below the\npromenade, paying for it nearly half of what was left of the four\nthousand francs.  The first three days she kept to her cabin except at\nthe dinner-hour, when she ventured to the deck just outside and walked\nup and down for exercise.  Then followed four days of nasty weather\nduring which she did not leave her bed.  As the sea calmed, she,\nwretched and reckless, had a chair put for herself under her window and\nsat there, veiled and swathed and turning her face away whenever a rare\nwandering passenger happened to pass along.  Toward noon a man paused\nbefore her to light a cigarette.  She, forgetting for the moment her\nprecautions, looked at him.  It chanced that he looked at her at\nexactly the same instant.  Their glances met.  He started nervously,\nmoved on a few steps, returned.  Said she mockingly:\n\n\"You know you needn't speak if you don't want to, Stanley.\"\n\n\"There isn't a soul on board that anybody ever knew or that ever knew\nanybody,\" said he.  \"So why not?\"\n\n\"And you look horribly bored.\"\n\n\"Unspeakably,\" replied Baird.  \"I've spoken to no one since I left\nParis.\"\n\n\"What are you doing on this ship?\" inquired she.\n\n\"To be perfectly honest,\" said he, \"I came this way to avoid you.  I\nwas afraid you'd take passage on my steamer just to amuse yourself with\nmy nervousness. And--here you are!\"\n\n\"Amusing myself with your nervousness.\"\n\n\"But I'm not nervous.  There's no danger.  Will you let me have a chair\nput beside yours?\"\n\n\"It will be a charity on your part,\" said she.\n\nWhen he was comfortably settled, he explained his uneasiness.  \"I see\nI've got to tell you,\" said he, \"for I don't want you to think me a\nshouting ass.  The fact is my wife wants to get a divorce from me and\nto soak me for big alimony.  She's a woman who'll do anything to gain\nher end, and--well, for some reason she's always been jealous of you. I\ndidn't care to get into trouble, or to get you into trouble.\"\n\n\"I'm traveling as Mary Stevens,\" said Mildred. \"No one knows I'm\naboard.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure we're quite safe.  We can enjoy the rest of this voyage.\"\n\nA sea voyage not merely induces but compels a feeling of absolute\ndetachment from the world.  To both Stanley and Mildred their\naffairs--the difficulties in which they were involved on terra\nfirma--ceased for the time to have any reality.  The universe was\nnothing but a vast stretch of water under a vast stretch of sky; the\nearth and the things thereof were a retrospect and a foreboding.\nWithout analyzing it, both he and she felt that they were free--free\nfrom cares, from responsibilities--free to amuse themselves.  And they\nproceeded to enjoy themselves in the necessarily quiet and limited way\nimposed by the littleness of their present world and the meagerness of\nthe resources.\n\nAs neither had the kind of mind that expands in abstractions, they were\nsoon talking in the most intimate and personal way about\nthemselves--were confessing things which neither would have breathed to\nanyone on land.  It was the man who set the example of breaking through\nthe barriers of conventional restraint--perhaps of delicacy, though it\nmust be said that human beings are rarely so fine in their reticences\nas the theory of refinement would have us believe.  Said Stanley, after\nthe preliminaries of partial confidence and halting avowal that could\nnot be omitted, even at sea, by a man of \"gentlemanly instinct\":\n\n\"I don't know why I shouldn't own up.  I know you'll never tell\nanybody.  Fact is, I and my wife were never in love with each other for\na second.  We married because we were in the same set and because our\nincomes together gave us enough to do the thing rather well.\" After a\nsolemn pause.  \"I was in love with another woman--one I couldn't marry.\nBut I'll not go into that.  As for my wife, I don't think she was in\nlove with anyone.  She's as cold as a stone.\"\n\nMildred smiled ironically.\n\nBaird saw and flushed.  \"At least, she was to me. I was ready to make a\nsort of bluff.  You see, a man feels guilty in those circumstances and\ndoesn't want to humiliate a woman.  But she--\" he laughed\nunpleasantly--\"she wasn't bothering about MY feelings. That's a nice,\nselfish little way you ladies have.\"\n\n\"She probably saw through you and hated you for playing the hypocrite\nto her,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"You may be right, I never thought of that,\" confessed he.  \"She\ncertainly had a vicious way of hammering the other woman indirectly.\nNot that she ever admitted being jealous.  I guess she knew.  Everybody\nusually knows everything.\"\n\n\"And there was a great deal of talk about you and me,\" said Mildred\nplacidly.\n\n\"I didn't say it was you,\" protested Stanley, reddening.\n\n\"No matter,\" said Mildred.  \"Don't bother about that.  It's all past\nand gone.\"\n\n\"Well, at any rate, my marriage was the mistake of my life.  I'm\ndetermined that she shan't trip me up and trim me for any alimony.  And\nas matters stand, she can't.  She left me of her own accord.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Mildred thoughtfully, \"if the wife leaves of her own\naccord, she can't get alimony?\"\n\n\"Certainly not--not a cent.\"\n\n\"I supposed so,\" said she.  \"I'm not sure I'd take it if I could get\nit.  Still, I suppose I would.\"  She laughed.  \"What's the use of being\na hypocrite with oneself?  I know I would.  All I could get.\"\n\n\"Then you had no LEGAL excuse for leaving?\"\n\n\"No,\" said she.  \"I--just bolted.  I don't know what's to become of me.\nI seem not to care, at present, but no doubt I shall as soon as we see\nland again.\"\n\n\"You'll go back to him,\" said Stanley.\n\n\"No,\" replied she, without emphasis or any accent whatever.\n\n\"Sure you will,\" rejoined he.  \"It's your living. What else can you do?\"\n\n\"That's what I must find out.  Surely there's something else for a\nwoman besides such a married life as mine.  I can't and won't go back\nto my husband.  And I can't and won't go to the house at Hanging Rock.\nThose two things are settled.\"\n\n\"You mean that?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.  And I've got--less than three hundred and fifty dollars\nin the whole world.\"\n\nBaird was silent.  He was roused from his abstraction by gradual\nconsciousness of an ironical smile on the face of the girl, for she did\nnot look like a married woman.  \"You are laughing at me.  Why?\"\ninquired he.\n\n\"I was reading your thoughts.\"\n\n\"You think you've frightened me?\"\n\n\"Naturally.  Isn't a confession such as I made enough to frighten a\nman?  It sounded as though I were getting ready to ask alms.\"\n\n\"So it did,\" said he.  \"But I wasn't thinking of it in that way.  You\nWILL be in a frightful fix pretty soon, won't you?\"\n\n\"It looks that way.  But you need not be uneasy.\"\n\n\"Oh, I want to help you.  I'll do everything I can. I was trying to\nthink of something you could make money at.  I was thinking of the\nstage, but I suppose you'd balk at that.  I'll admit it isn't the life\nfor a lady.  But the same thing's true of whatever money can be made\nat.  If I were you, I'd go back.\"\n\n\"If I were myself, I'd go back,\" said Mildred. \"But I'm not myself.\"\n\n\"You will be again, as soon as you face the situation.\"\n\n\"No,\" said she slowly, \"no, I shall never be myself again.\"\n\n\"But you could have everything a woman wants. Except, of\ncourse--perhaps--  But you never struck me as being especially\nsentimental.\"\n\n\"Sentiment has nothing to do with it,\" rejoined she. \"Do you think I\ncould get a place on the stage?\"\n\n\"Oh, you'd have to study a while, I suppose.\"\n\n\"But I can't afford that.  If I could afford to study, I'd have my\nvoice trained.\"\n\nBaird's face lighted up with enthusiasm.  \"The very thing!\" he cried.\n\"You've got a voice, a grand-opera voice.  I've heard lots of people\nsay so, and it sounded that way to me.  You must cultivate your voice.\"\n\nMildred laughed.  \"Don't talk nonsense.  Even I know that's nonsense.\nThe lessons alone would cost thousands of dollars.  And how could I\nlive for the four or five years?\"\n\n\"You didn't let me finish,\" said Baird.  \"I was going to say that when\nyou get to New York you must go and have your voice passed on--by some\nimpartial person.  If that person says it's worth cultivating, why, I'm\nwilling to back you--as a business proposition. I can afford to take\nthe risk.  So, you see, it's all perfectly simple.\"\n\nHe had spoken rapidly, with a covert suggestion of fear lest she would\nrebuke him sharply for what she might regard as an impertinent offer.\nShe surprised him by looking at him calmly, reflectively, and saying:\n\n\"Yes, you could afford it, couldn't you?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I could.  And it's the sort of thing that's done every day.\nOf course, no one'd know that we had made this little business\narrangement.  But that's easily managed.  I'd be glad if you'd let me\ndo it, Mildred. I'd like to feel that I was of some use in the world.\nAnd I'd like to do something for YOU.\"\n\nBy way of exceedingly cautious experiment he ventured to put ever so\nslight an accent of tenderness upon the \"you.\"  He observed her\nfurtively but nervously. He could not get a hint of what was in her\nmind.  She gazed out toward the rising and falling horizon line.\nPresently she said:\n\n\"I'll think about it.\"\n\n\"You must let me do it, Mildred.  It's the sensible thing--and you know\nme well enough to know that my friendship can be counted on.\"\n\n\"I'll think about it,\" was all she would concede.\n\nThey discussed the singing career all that and the succeeding days--the\npossibilities, the hopes, the dangers--but the hopes a great deal more\nthan the dangers. He became more and more interested in her and in the\nproject, as her beauty shone out with the tranquillizing sea and as her\nold charm of cleverness at saying things that amused him reasserted\nitself.  She, dubious and lukewarm at first, soon was trying to curb\nher own excited optimism; but long before they sighted Sandy Hook she\nwas merely pretending to hang back. He felt discouraged by her parting!\n\"If I decide to go on, I'll write you in a few days.\"  But he need not\nhave felt so.  She had made up her mind to accept his offer.  As for\nthe complications involved in such curiously intimate relations with a\nman of his temperament, habits, and inclinations, she saw them very\nvaguely indeed--refused to permit herself to see them any less vaguely.\nTime enough to deal with complications when and as they arose; why\nneedlessly and foolishly annoy herself and hamper herself? Said she to\nherself, \"I must begin to be practical.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\nAT the pier Mildred sent her mother a telegram, giving the train by\nwhich she would arrive--that and nothing more.  As she descended from\nthe parlor-car there stood Mrs. Presbury upon the platform, face\nwreathed in the most joyous of welcoming smiles, not a surface trace of\nthe curiosity and alarm storming within.  After they had kissed and\nembraced with a genuine emotion which they did not try to hide, because\nboth suddenly became unconscious of that world whereof ordinarily they\nwere constantly mindful--after caresses and tears Mrs. Presbury said:\n\n\"It's all very well to dress plain, when everyone knows you can afford\nthe best.  But don't you think you're overdoing it a little?\"\n\nMildred laughed somewhat nervously.  \"Wait till we're safe at home,\"\nsaid she.\n\nOn the way up from the station in the carriage they chattered away in\nthe liveliest fashion, to make the proper impression upon any observing\nHanging-Rockers.  \"Luckily, Presbury's gone to town to-day,\" said his\nwife.  \"But really he's quite livable--hasn't gone back to his old\nways.  He doesn't know it, but he's rapidly growing deaf.  He imagines\nthat everyone is speaking more and more indistinctly, and he has lost\ninterest in conversation.  Then, too, he has done well in Wall Street,\nand that has put him in a good humor.\"\n\n\"He'll not be surprised to see me--alone,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Wait till we're home,\" said her mother nervously.\n\nAt the house Mrs. Presbury carried on a foolish, false-sounding\nconversation for the benefit of the servants, and finally conducted\nMildred to her bedroom and shut doors and drew portieres and glanced\ninto closets before saying:  \"Now, what IS the matter, Millie? WHERE is\nyour husband?\"\n\n\"In Paris, I suppose,\" replied Mildred.  \"I have left him, and I shall\nnever go back.\"\n\n\"Presbury said you would!\" cried her mother. \"But I didn't believe it.\nI don't believe it.  I brought you up to do your duty, and I know you\nwill.\"\n\nThis was Mildred's first opportunity for frank and plain speaking; and\nthat is highly conducive to frank and plain thinking.  She now began to\nsee clearly why she had quit the general.  Said she:  \"Mamma, to be\nhonest and not mince words, I've left him because there's nothing in\nit.\"\n\n\"Isn't he rich?\" inquired her mother.  \"I've always had a kind of\npresent--\"\n\n\"Oh, he's rich, all right,\" interrupted the girl. \"But he saw to it\nthat I got no benefit from that.\"\n\n\"But you wrote me how he was buying you everything!\"\n\n\"So I thought.  In fact he was buying ME nothing.\" And she went on to\nexplain the general's system.\n\nHer mother listened impatiently.  She would have interrupted the long\nand angry recital many times had not Mildred insisted on a full hearing\nof her grievances, of the outrages that had been heaped upon her.\n\"And,\" she ended, \"I suppose he's got it so arranged that he could have\nme arrested as a thief for taking the gold bag.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's terrible and all that,\" said her mother. \"But I should have\nthought living with me here when Presbury was carrying on so dreadfully\nwould have taught you something.  Your case isn't an exception, any\nmore than mine is.  That's the sort of thing we women have to put up\nwith from men, when we're in their power.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said Mildred loftily.\n\n\"Yes, you,\" retorted her mother.  \"ANY woman. EVERY woman.  Unless we\nhave money of our own, we all have trouble with the men about money,\nsooner or later, in one way or another.  And rich men!--why, it's\nnotorious that they're always more or less mean about money. A wife has\ngot to use tact.  Why, I even had to use some tact with your father,\nand he was as generous a man as ever lived.  Tact--that's a woman's\nwhole life. You ought to have used tact.  You'll go back to him and use\ntact.\"\n\n\"You don't know him, mamma!\" cried Mildred. \"He's a monster.  He isn't\nhuman.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury drew a long face and said in a sad, soothing voice: \"Yes,\nI know, dear.  Men are very, very awful, in some ways, to a nice\nwoman--with refined, ladylike instincts.  It's a great shock to a\npure--\"\n\n\"Oh, gammon!\" interrupted Mildred.  \"Don't be silly, mother.  It isn't\nworth while for one woman to talk that kind of thing to another.  I\ndidn't fully know what I was doing when I married a man I didn't\nlove--a man who was almost repulsive to me.  But I knew enough.  And I\nwas getting along well enough, as any woman does, no matter what she\nmay say--yes, you needn't look shocked, for that's hypocrisy, and I\nknow it now--  But, as I was saying, I didn't begin to HATE him until\nhe tried to make a slave of me.  A slave!\" she shuddered.  \"He's a\nmonster!\"\n\n\"A little tact, and you can get everything you want,\" insisted her\nmother.\n\n\"I tell you, you don't know the man,\" cried Mildred. \"By tact I suppose\nyou mean I could have sold things behind his back--and all that.\"  She\nlaughed.  \"He hasn't got any back.  He had it so arranged that those\ncold, wicked eyes of his were always watching me.  His second wife\ntried 'tact.'  He caught her and drove her into the streets.  I'd have\nhad no chance to get a cent, and if I had gotten it I'd not have dared\nspend it.  Do you imagine I ran away from him without having THOUGHT?\nIf there'd been any way of staying on, any way of making things even\nendurable, I'd have stayed.\"\n\n\"But you've got to go back, Milly,\" cried her mother, in tears.\n\n\"You mean that you can't support me?\"\n\n\"And your brother Frank--\" Mrs. Presbury's eyes flashed and her rather\nstout cheeks quivered.  \"I never thought I'd tell anybody, but I'll\ntell you.  I never liked your brother Frank, and he never liked me.\nThat sounds dreadful, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"No, mother dear,\" said Mildred gently.  \"I've learned that life isn't\nat all as--as everybody pretends.\"\n\n\"Indeed it isn't,\" said her mother.  \"Mothers always have favorites\namong their children, and very often a mother dislikes one of her\nchildren.  Of course she hides her feeling and does her duty.  But all\nthe same she can't help the feeling that is down in her heart.  I had a\npresentiment before he was born that I wouldn't like him, and sure\nenough, I didn't.  And he didn't like me, or his father, or any of us.\"\n\n\"It would never occur to me to turn to him,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Then you see that you've got to go back to the general.  You can't get\na divorce and alimony, for it was you that left him--and for no cause.\nHe was within his rights.\"\n\nMildred hesitated, confessed:  \"I had thought of going back to him and\nacting in such a way that he'd be glad to give me a divorce and an\nallowance.\"\n\n\"Yes, you might do that,\" said her mother.  \"A great many women do.\nAnd, after all, haven't they a right to?  A lady has got to have proper\nsupport, and is it just to ask her to live with a man she loathes?\"\n\n\"I haven't thought of the right or wrong of it,\" said Mildred.  \"It\nlooks to me as though right and wrong have very little to do with life\nas it's lived.  They're for hypocrites--and fools.\"\n\n\"Mildred!\" exclaimed her mother, deeply shocked.\n\nMildred was not a little shocked at her own thoughts as she inspected\nthem in the full light into which speech had dragged them.  \"Anyhow,\"\nshe went on, \"I soon saw that such a plan was hopeless.  He's not the\nman to be trifled with.  Long before I could drive him to give me a\nliving and let me go he would have driven me to flight or suicide.\"\n\nHer mother had now had time to reflect upon Mildred's revelations.\nAided by the impressions she herself had gotten of the little general,\nshe began to understand why her daughter had fled and why she would not\nreturn. She felt that the situation was one which time alone could\nsolve.  Said she:  \"Well, the best thing is for you to stay on here and\nwait until he makes some move.\"\n\n\"He'll have me watched--that's all he'll do,\" said Mildred.  \"When he\ngets ready he'll divorce me for deserting him.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury felt that she was right.  But, concealing her\ndespondency, she said:  \"All we can do is to wait and see.  You must\nsend for your luggage.\"\n\n\"I've nothing but a large bag,\" said Mildred.  \"I checked it in the\nparcel-room of the New York station.\"\n\nMrs. Presbury was overwhelmed.  How account to Hanging Rock for the\nreappearance of a baggageless and husbandless bride?  But she held up\nbravely. With a cheerfulness that did credit to her heart and showed\nhow well she loved her daughter she said:  \"We must do the best we can.\nWe'll get up some story.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mildred.  \"I'm going back to New York.  You can tell people\nhere what you please--that I've gone to rejoin him or to wait for\nhim--any old thing.\"\n\n\"At least you'll wait and talk with Presbury,\" pleaded her mother.  \"He\nis VERY sensible.\"\n\n\"If he has anything to suggest,\" said Mildred, \"he can write it.  I'll\nsend you my address.\"\n\n\"Milly,\" cried her mother, agitated to the depths, \"where ARE you\ngoing?  WHAT are you going to do? You look so strange--not at all like\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I'm going to a hotel to-night--probably to a boarding-house\nto-morrow,\" said Mildred.  \"In a few days I shall begin to--\" she\nhesitated, decided against confidence--\"begin to support myself at\nsomething or other.\"\n\n\"You must be crazy!\" cried her mother.  \"You wouldn't do anything--and\nyou couldn't.\"\n\n\"Let's not discuss it, mamma,\" said the girl tranquilly.\n\nThe mother looked at her with eyes full of the suspicion one lady\ncannot but have as to the projects of another lady in such\ncircumstances.\n\n\"Mildred,\" she said pleadingly, \"you must be careful.  You'll find\nyourself involved in a dreadful scandal. I know you wouldn't DO\nanything WRONG no matter how you were driven.  But--\"\n\n\"I'll not do anything FOOLISH, mamma,\" interrupted the girl.  \"You are\nthinking about men, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Men are always ready to destroy a woman,\" said her mother.  \"You must\nbe careful--\"\n\nMildred was laughing.  \"Oh, mamma,\" she cried, \"do be sensible and do\ngive me credit for a little sense.  I've got a very clear idea of what\na woman ought to do about men, and I assure you I'm not going to be\nFOOLISH. And you know a woman who isn't foolish can be trusted where a\nwoman who's only protected by her principles would yield to the first\ntemptation--or hunt round for a temptation.\"\n\n\"But you simply can't go to New York and live there all alone--and with\nnothing!\"\n\n\"Can I stay here--for more than a few days?\"\n\n\"But maybe, after a few days--\" stammered her mother.\n\n\"You see, I've got to begin,\" said Mildred.  \"So why delay?  I'd gain\nnothing.  I'd simply start Hanging Rock to gossiping--and start Mr.\nPresbury to acting like a fiend again.\"\n\nHer mother refused to be convinced--was the firmer, perhaps, because\nshe saw that Mildred was unshakable in her resolve to leave\nforthwith--the obviously sensible and less troublesome course.  They\nemployed the rest of Mildred's three hours' stop in arguing--when\nMildred was not raging against the little general.  Her mother was more\nthan willing to assist her in this denunciation, but Mildred preferred\nto do it all herself. She had--perhaps by unconsciously absorbed\ntraining from her lawyer father--an unusual degree of ability to see\nboth sides of a question.  When she assailed her husband, she saw only\nher own side; but somehow when her mother railed and raved, she began\nto see another side--and the sight was not agreeable.  She wished to\nfeel that her husband was altogether in the wrong; she did not wish to\nhave intruded upon her such facts as that she had sold herself to\nhim--quite in the customary way of ladies, but nevertheless quite\nshamelessly--or that in strict justice she had done nothing for him to\nentitle her to a liberal money allowance or any allowance at all.\n\nOn the train, going back to New York, she admitted to herself that the\nrepulsive little general had held strictly to the terms of the\nbargain--\"but only a devil and one with not a single gentlemanly\ninstinct would insist on such a bargain.\"  It took away much of the\nshame, and all of the sting, of despising herself to feel that she was\nlooking still lower when she turned to despising him.\n\nTo edge out the little general she began to think of her mother, but as\nshe passed in review what her mother had said and how she had said it\nshe saw that for all the protests and arguings her mother was more than\nresigned to her departure.  Mildred felt no bitterness; ever since she\ncould remember her mother had been a shifter of responsibility.  Still,\nto stare into the face of so disagreeable a fact as that one had no\nplace on earth to go to, no one on earth to turn to, not even one's own\nmother--to stare on at that grimacing ugliness did not tend to\ncheerfulness.  Mildred tried to think of the future--but how could she\nthink of something that was nothing?  She knew that she would go on,\nsomehow, in some direction, but by no effort of her imagination could\nshe picture it.  She was so impressed by the necessity of considering\nthe future that, to rouse herself, she tried to frighten herself with\npictures of poverty and misery, of herself a derelict in the vast and\ncold desert of New York--perhaps in rags, hungry, ill, but all in vain.\nShe did not believe it. Always she had had plenty to wear and to eat,\nand comfortable surroundings.  She could no more think of herself as\nwithout those things than a living person can imagine himself dead.\n\n\"I'm a fool,\" she said to herself.  \"I'm certain to get into all sorts\nof trouble.  How can it be otherwise, when I've no money, no friends,\nno experience, no way of making a living--no honest way--perhaps no way\nof the other kind, either?\"  There are many women who ecstasize their\neasily tickled vanities by fancying that if they were so disposed they\nneed only flutter an eyelid to have men by the legion striving for\ntheir favors, each man with a bag of gold.  Mildred, inexperienced as\nshe was, had no such delusions.  Her mind happened not to be of that\nchastely licentious caste which continually revolves and fantastically\nexaggerates the things of the body.\n\nShe could not understand her own indifference about the future.  She\ndid not realize that it was wholly due to Stanley Baird's offer.  She\nwas imagining she was regarding that offer as something she might\npossibly consider, but probably would not.  She did not know that her\nsoul had seized upon it, had enfolded it and would on no account let it\ngo.  It is the habit of our secret selves thus to make decisions and\nawait their own good time for making us acquainted with them.\n\nWith her bag on the seat beside her she set out to find a temporary\nlodging.  Not until several hotels had refused her admittance on the\npretext that they were \"full up\" did she realize that a young woman\nalone is an object of suspicion in New York.  When a fourth room-clerk\nexpressed his polite regrets she looked him straight in the eye and\nsaid:\n\n\"I understand.  But I can't sleep in the street.  You must tell me\nwhere I can go.\"\n\n\"Well, there's the Ripon over in Seventh Avenue,\" said he.\n\n\"Is it respectable?\" said she.\n\n\"Oh, it's very clean and comfortable there,\" said he. \"They'll treat\nyou right.\"\n\n\"Is it respectable?\" said she.\n\n\"Well, now, it doesn't LOOK queer, if that's what you mean,\" replied\nhe.  \"You'll do very nicely there.  You can be just as quiet as you\nwant.\"\n\nShe saw that hotel New York would not believe her respectable.  So to\nthe Ripon she went, and was admitted without discussion.  As the last\nrespectable clerk had said, it did not LOOK queer.  But it FELT queer;\nshe resolved that she would go into a boarding-house the very next day.\n\nHere again what seemed simple proved difficult.  No respectable\nboarding-house would have Miss Mary Stevens.  She was confident that\nnothing in her dress or manner hinted mystery.  Yet those sharp-eyed\nlandladies seemed to know at once that there was something peculiar\nabout her.  Most of them became rude the instant they set eyes upon\nher.  A few--of the obviously less prosperous class--talked with her,\nseemed to be listening for something which her failing to say decided\nthem upon all but ordering her out of the house.  She, hindered by her\ninnocence, was slow in realizing that she could not hope for admission\nto any select respectable circle, even of high-class salesladies and\nclerks, unless she gave a free and clear account of herself--whence she\nhad come, what she was doing, how she got her money.\n\nToward the end of the second day's wearisome and humiliating search she\nfound a house that would admit her.  It was a pretentious,\nwell-furnished big house in Madison Avenue.  The price--thirty-five\ndollars a week for board, a bedroom with a folding bed in an alcove,\nand a bath, was more than double what she had counted on paying, but\nshe discovered that decent and clean lodgings and food fit to eat were\nnot to be had for less.  \"And I simply can't live pig-fashion,\" said\nshe.  \"I'd be so depressed that I could do nothing.  I can't live like\na wild animal, and I won't.\"  She had some vague\nnotion--foreboding--that this was not the proper spirit with which to\nface life.  \"I suppose I'm horribly foolish,\" reflected she, \"but if I\nmust go down, I'll go down with my colors flying.\"  She did not know\nprecisely what that phrase meant, but it sounded fine and brave and\nheartened her to take the expensive lodgings.\n\nThe landlady was a Mrs. Belloc.  Mildred had not talked with her twenty\nminutes before she had a feeling that this name was assumed.  The\nevening of her first day in the house she learned that her guess was\ncorrect--learned it from the landlady herself.  After dinner Mrs.\nBelloc came into her room to cheer her up, to find out about her and to\ntell her about herself.\n\n\"Now that you've come,\" said she, \"the house is full up--except some\nlittle rooms at the top that I'd as lief not fill.  The probabilities\nare that any ladies who would take them wouldn't be refined enough to\nsuit those I have.  There are six, not counting me, every one with a\nbath and two with private parlors.  And as they're all handsome,\nsensible women, ladylike and steady, I think the prospects are that\nthey'll pay promptly and that I won't have any trouble.\"\n\nMildred reflected upon this curious statement.  It sounded innocent\nenough, yet what a peculiar way to put a simple fact.\n\n\"Of course it's none of my business how people live as long as they\nkeep up the respectabilities,\" pursued Mrs. Belloc.  \"It don't do to\ninquire into people in New York.  Most of 'em come here because they\nwant to live as they please.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said Mildred a little nervously, for she suspected her\nlandlady of hitting at her, and wondered if she had come to\ncross-examine her and, if the results were not satisfactory, to put her\ninto the street.\n\n\"I know _I_ came for that reason,\" pursued Mrs. Belloc.  \"I was a\nschool-teacher up in New England until about two years ago.  Did you\never teach school?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Mildred.  \"And I don't think I ever shall.  I don't\nknow enough.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you do.  A teacher doesn't need to know much.  The wages are\nso poor--at least up in New England--that they don't expect you to know\nanything. It's all in the books.  I left because I couldn't endure the\nlife.  Lord! how dull those little towns are! Ever live in a little\ntown?\"\n\n\"All my life,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Well, you'll never go back.\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"You won't.  Why should you?  A sensible woman with looks--especially\nif she knows how to carry her clothes--can stay in New York as long as\nshe pleases, and live off the fat of the land.\"\n\n\"That's good news,\" said Mildred.  She began to like the landlady--not\nfor what she said, but for the free and frank and friendly way of the\nsaying--a human way, a comradely way, a live-and-let-live way.\n\n\"I didn't escape from New England without a struggle,\" continued Mrs.\nBelloc, who was plainly showing that she had taken a great fancy to\n\"Mary Stevens.\"\n\n\"I suppose it was hard to save the money out of your salary,\" said\nMildred.\n\nMrs. Belloc laughed.  She was about thirty-five years old, though her\neyes and her figure were younger than that.  Her mouth was pleasant\nenough, but had lost some of its freshness.  \"Save money!\" cried she.\n\"I'd never have succeeded that way.  I'd be there yet. I had never\nmarried--had two or three chances, but all from poor sticks looking for\nsomeone to support them.  I saw myself getting old.  I was looking\nyears older than I do now.  Talk about sea air for freshening a woman\nup--it isn't in it with the air of New York. Here's the town where\nwomen stay young.  If I had come here five years ago I could almost try\nfor the squab class.\"\n\n\"Squab class?\" queried Mildred.\n\n\"Yes, squabs.  Don't you see them around everywhere?--the women dressed\nlike girls of sixteen to eighteen--and some of them are that, and\nyounger. They go hopping and laughing about--and they seem to please\nthe men and to have no end of a good time. Especially the oldish men.\nOh, yes, you know a squab on sight--tight skirt, low shoes and silk\nstockings, cute pretty face, always laughing, hat set on rakishly and\nhair done to match, and always a big purse or bag--with a yellow-back\nor so in it--as a kind of a hint, I guess.\"\n\nMildred had seen squabs.  \"I've envied them--in a way,\" said she.\n\"Their parents seem to let them do about as they please.\"\n\n\"Their parents don't know--or don't care.  Sometimes it's one,\nsometimes the other.  They travel in two sets.  One is where they meet\nyoung fellows of their own class--the kind they'll probably marry,\nunless they happen to draw the capital prize.  The other set they\ntravel in--well, it's the older men they meet round the swell hotels\nand so on--the yellow-back men.\"\n\n\"How queer!\" exclaimed Mildred, before whose eyes a new world was\nopening.  \"But how do they--these--squabs--account for the money?\"\n\n\"How do a thousand and one women in this funny town account at home for\nmoney and things?\" retorted Mrs. Belloc.  \"Nothing's easier.  For\ninstance, often these squabs do--or pretend to do--a little something\nin the way of work--a little canvassing or artists' model or anything\nyou please.  That helps them to explain at home--and also to make each\nof the yellow-back men think he's the only one and that he's being\nalmost loved for himself alone.\"\n\nMrs. Belloc laughed.  Mildred was too astonished to laugh, and too\ninterested--and too startled or shocked.\n\n\"But I was telling you how _I_ got down here,\" continued the landlady.\n\"Up in my town there was an old man--about seventy-five--close as the\nbark on a tree, and ugly and mean.\"  She paused to draw a long breath\nand to shake her head angrily yet triumphantly at some figure her fancy\nconjured up. \"Oh, he WAS a pup!--and is!  Well, anyhow, I decided that\nI'd marry him.  So I wrote home for fifty dollars.  I borrowed another\nfifty here and there.  I had seventy-five saved up against sickness.  I\nwent up to Boston and laid it all out in underclothes and house\nthings--not showy but fine and good to look at.  Then one day, when the\nweather was fine and I knew the old man would be out in his buggy\ndriving round--I dressed myself up to beat the band.  I took hours to\nit--scrubbing, powdering, sacheting, perfuming, fixing the hair, fixing\nmy finger-nails, fixing up my feet, polishing every nail and making\nthem look better than most hands.\"\n\nMildred was so interested that she was excited.  What strange freak was\ncoming?\n\n\"You never could guess,\" pursued Mrs. Belloc, complacently.  \"I took my\nsunshade and went out, all got up to kill.  And I walked along the road\nuntil I saw the old man's buggy coming with him in it.  Then I gave my\nankle a frightful wrench.  My!  How it hurt!\"\n\n\"What a pity!\" said Mildred sympathetically. \"What a shame!\"\n\n\"A pity?  A shame?\" cried Mrs. Belloc, laughing. \"Why, my dear, I did\nit a-purpose.\"\n\n\"On purpose!\" exclaimed Mildred.\n\n\"Certainly.  That was my game.  I screamed out with pain--and the\nscream was no fake, I can tell you.  And I fell down by the roadside on\na nice grassy spot where no dust would get on me.  Well, up comes the\nold skinflint in his buggy.  He climbed down and helped me get off my\nslipper and stocking.  I knew I had him the minute I saw his old face\nlooking at that foot I had fixed up so beautifully.\"\n\n\"How DID you ever think of it?\" exclaimed Mildred.\n\n\"Go and teach school for ten years in a dull little town, my dear--and\nlook in the glass every day and see your youth fading away--and you'll\nthink of most anything.  Well, to make a long story short, the old man\ntook me in the buggy to his house where he lived with his deaf,\nhalf-blind old widowed daughter.  I had to stay there three weeks.  I\nmarried him the fourth week.  And just two months to a day from the\nafternoon I sprained my ankle, he gave me fifty dollars a week--all\nsigned and sealed by a lawyer--to go away and leave him alone.  I might\nhave stood out for more, but I was too anxious to get to New York.  And\nhere I am!\"  She gazed about the well-furnished room, typical of that\nalmost luxurious house, with an air of triumphant satisfaction.  Said\nshe:  \"I've no patience with a woman who says she can't get on. Where's\nher brains?\"\n\nMildred was silent.  Perhaps it was a feeling of what was hazily in the\nyounger woman's mind and a desire to answer it that led Mrs. Belloc to\nsay further:  \"I suppose there's some that would criticize my way of\ngetting there.  But I want to know, don't all women get there by\nworking men?  Only most of them are so stupid that they have to go on\nliving with the man. I think it's low to live with a man you hate.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not criticizing anybody,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"I didn't think you were,\" said Mrs. Belloc.  \"If I hadn't seen you\nweren't that kind, I'd not have been so confidential.  Not that I'm\nsecretive with anybody. I say and do what I please.  Anyone who doesn't\nlike my way or me can take the other side of the street. I didn't come\nto New York to go in society.  I came here to LIVE.\"\n\nMildred looked at her admiringly.  There were things about Mrs. Belloc\nthat she did not admire; other things--suspected rather than known\nthings--that she knew she would shrink from, but she heartily admired\nand profoundly envied her utter indifference to the opinion of others,\nher fine independent way of walking her own path at her own gait.\n\n\"I took this boarding-house,\" Mrs. Belloc went on, \"because I didn't\nwant to be lonesome.  I don't like all--or even most of--the ladies\nthat live here.  But they're all amusing to talk with--and don't put on\nairs except with their men friends.  And one or two are the real\nthing--good-hearted, fond of a joke, without any meanness.  I tell you,\nNew York is a mighty fine place if you get 'in right.'  Of course, if\nyou don't, it's h-e-l-l.\"  (Mrs. Belloc took off its unrefined edge by\nspelling it.)  \"But what place isn't?\" she added.\n\n\"And your husband never bothers you?\" inquired Mildred.\n\n\"And never will,\" replied Mrs. Belloc.  \"When he dies I'll come into a\nlittle more--about a hundred and fifty a week in all.  Not a fortune,\nbut enough with what the boarding-house brings in.  I'm a pretty fair\nbusiness woman.\"\n\n\"I should say so!\" exclaimed Mildred.\n\n\"You said you were Miss Stevens, didn't you?\" said Mrs. Belloc--and\nMildred knew that her turn had come.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied she.  \"But I am also a married woman.\"  She hesitated,\nreddened.  \"I didn't give you my married name.\"\n\n\"That's your own business,\" said Mrs. Belloc in her easiest manner. \"My\nright name isn't Belloc, either. But I've dropped that other life. You\nneedn't feel a bit embarrassed in this house.  Some of my boarders SEEM\nto be married.  All that have regular-appearing husbands SAY they are.\nWhat do I care, so long as everything goes along smoothly?  I don't get\nexcited about trifles.\"\n\n\"Some day perhaps I'll tell you about myself,\" said Mildred.  \"Just at\npresent I--well, I seem not to be able to talk about things.\"\n\n\"It's not a bad idea to keep your mouth shut, as long as your affairs\nare unsettled,\" advised Mrs. Belloc. \"I can see you've had little\nexperience.  But you'll come out all right.  Just keep cool, and don't\nfret about trifles.  And don't let any man make a fool of you.  That's\nwhere we women get left.  We're afraid of men.  We needn't be.  We can\nmighty easily make them afraid of us.  Use the soft hand till you get\nhim well in your grip.  Then the firm hand.  Nothing coarse or cruel or\nmean.  But firm and self-respecting.\"\n\nMildred was tempted to take Mrs. Belloc fully into her confidence and\nget the benefit of the advice of shrewdness and experience.  So strong\nwas the temptation, she would have yielded to it had Mrs. Belloc asked\na few tactful, penetrating questions.  But Mrs. Belloc refrained, and\nMildred's timidity or delicacy induced her to postpone.  The next day\nshe wrote Stanley Baird, giving her address and her name and asking him\nto call \"any afternoon at four or five.\"  She assumed that he would\ncome on the following day, but the letter happened to reach him within\nan hour of her mailing it, and he came that very afternoon.\n\nWhen she went down to the drawing-room to receive him, she found him\nstanding in the middle of the room gazing about with a quizzical\nexpression.  As soon as the greetings were over he said:\n\n\"You must get out of here, Mildred.  This won't do.\"\n\n\"Indeed I shan't,\" said she.  \"I've looked everywhere, and this is the\nonly comfortable place I could find--where the rates were reasonable\nand where the landlady didn't have her nose in everybody's business.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said he.  \"This is a bird-cage.  Highly gilded,\nbut a bird-cage.\"\n\nShe had never heard the phrase, but she understood--and instantly she\nknew that he was right.  She colored violently, sat down abruptly.  But\nin a moment she recovered herself, and with fine defiance said:\n\n\"I don't care.  Mrs. Belloc is a kind-hearted woman, and it's as easy\nto be respectable here as anywhere.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" assented he.  \"But you've got to consider appearances to a\ncertain extent.  You won't be able to find the right sort of a\nboarding-house--one you'd be comfortable in.  You've got to have a flat\nof your own.\"\n\n\"I can't afford it,\" said Mildred.  \"I can't afford this, even.  But I\nsimply will not live in a shabby, mussy way.\"\n\n\"That's right!\" cried Stanley.  \"You can't do proper work in poor\nsurroundings.  Some women could, but not your sort.  But don't worry.\nI'm going to see you through.  I'll find a place--right away. You want\nto start in at once, don't you?\"\n\n\"I've got to,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Then leave it all to me.\"\n\n\"But WHAT am I to do?\"\n\n\"Sing, if you can.  If not, then act.  We'll have you on the stage\nwithin a year or so.  I'm sure of it. And I'll get my money back, with\ninterest.\"\n\n\"I don't see how I can accept it,\" said Mildred very feebly.\n\n\"You've got to,\" said Stanley.  \"What alternative is there?  None.  So\nlet's bother no more about it. I'll consult with those who know, find\nout what the thing costs, and arrange everything.  You're as helpless\nas a baby, and you know it.\"\n\nYes, Mildred knew it.\n\nHe looked at her with an amused smile.  \"Come, out with it!\" he cried.\n\"You've got something on your mind.  Let's get everything straight--and\nkeep it that way.\"\n\nMildred hung her head.\n\n\"You're uneasy because I, a man, am doing this for you, a young woman?\nIs that it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she confessed.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, and spoke in a brisk,\nbusinesslike way.  \"In the first place, it's got to be done, hasn't it?\nAnd someone has got to do it?  And there is no one offering but me?  Am\nI right?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Then _I_'ve got to do it, and you've GOT to let me. There's logic, if\never there was logic.  A Philadelphia lawyer couldn't knock a hole in\nit.  You trust me, don't you?\"\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"You don't trust me, then,\" said he cheerfully. \"Well, perhaps you're\nright.  But you trust yourself, don't you?\"\n\nShe moved restlessly, but remained silent.\n\n\"You are afraid I might put you in a difficult position?\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" she admitted, in a low, embarrassed voice.\n\n\"You fear that I expect some return which you do not intend to give?\"\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"Well, I don't,\" said he bluntly.  \"So put your mind at rest.  Some day\nI'll tell you why I am doing this, but I want you to feel that I ask\nnothing of you but my money back with interest, when you can afford to\npay.\"\n\n\"I can't feel that,\" said she.  \"You're putting me in your debt--so\nheavily that I'd feel I ought to pay anything you asked.  But I\ncouldn't and wouldn't pay.\"\n\n\"Unless you felt like it?\" suggested he.\n\n\"It's honest for me to warn you that I'm not likely to feel that way.\"\n\n\"There is such a thing as winning a woman's love, isn't there?\" said he\njestingly.  It was difficult to tell when Stanley Baird was jesting and\nwhen he was in earnest.\n\n\"Is that what you expect?\" said she gravely.\n\n\"If I say yes?\"\n\nShe lowered her eyes and laughed in an embarrassed way.\n\nHe was frankly amused.  \"You see, you feel that you're in my power. And\nyou are.  So why not make the best of it?\"  A pause, then he said\nabruptly and with a convincing manliness, \"I think, Mildred, you can\ntrust me not to be a beast.\"\n\nShe colored and looked at him with quick contrition. \"I'm ashamed of\nmyself,\" said she.  \"Please forget that I said anything.  I'll take\nwhat I must, and I'll pay it back as soon as I can.  And--thank you,\nStanley.\" The tears were in her eyes.  \"If I had anything worth your\ntaking I'd be glad to give it to you.  What vain fools we women are!\"\n\n\"Aren't you, though!\" laughed he.  \"And now it's all settled--until\nyou're on the stage, and free, and the money's paid back--WITH\ninterest.  I shall charge you six per cent.\"\n\nWhen she first knew him she had not been in the least impressed by what\nnow seemed to her his finest and rarest trait, for, in those days she\nhad been as ignorant of the realities of human nature as one who has\nnever adventured his boat beyond the mouth of the peaceful land-locked\nharbor is ignorant of the open sea.  But in the hard years she had been\nlearning--not only from Presbury and General Siddall, but from the cook\nand the housemaid, from every creditor, every tradesman, everyone whose\nattitude socially toward her had been modified by her changed\nfortunes--and whose attitude had not been changed?  Thus, she was now\nable to appreciate--at least in some measure--Stanley Baird's delicacy\nand tact.  No, not delicacy and tact, for that implied effort.  His\nability to put this offer in such a way that she could accept without\nserious embarrassment arose from a genuine indifference to money as\nmoney, a habit of looking upon it simply as a means to an end.  He\noffered her the money precisely as he would have offered her his\nsuperior strength if it had been necessary to cross a too deep and\nswift creek.  She had the sense that he felt he was doing something\neven less notable than he admitted, and that he talked of it as a\nvaluable and rather unusual service simply because it was the habit\nthus to regard such matters.\n\nAs they talked on of \"the great career\" her spirits went up and up.  It\nwas evident that he now had a new and keen interest in life, that she\nwas doing him a greater favor than he was doing her.  He had always had\nmoney, plenty of it, more than he could use.  He now had more than\never--for, several rich relatives had died and, after the habit of the\nrich, had left everything to him, the one of all the connections who\nneeded it least.  He had a very human aversion to spending money upon\npeople or things he did not like.  He would have fought to the last\ncourt an attempt by his wife to get alimony.  He had a reputation with\nthe \"charity gang\" of being stingy because he would not give them so\nmuch as the price of a bazaar ticket. Also, the impecunious spongers at\nhis clubs spread his fame as a \"tight-wad\" because he refused to let\nthem \"stick him up\" for even a round of drinks.  Where many a really\nstingy man yielded through weakness or fear of public opinion, he stood\nfirm.  His one notable surrender of any kind had been his marriage;\nthat bitter experience had cured him of the surrendering habit for all\ntime.  Thenceforth he did absolutely and in everything as he pleased.\n\nMildred had heard that he was close about money. She had all but\nforgotten it, because her own experience with him had made such a\ncharge seem ridiculous. She now assumed--so far as she thought about it\nat all--that he was extremely generous.  She did not realize what a\nfine discriminating generosity his was, or how striking an evidence of\nhis belief in her as well as of his liking for her.\n\nAs he rose to go he said:  \"You mustn't forget that our arrangement is\na secret between us.  Neither of us can afford to have anyone know it.\"\n\n\"There isn't anyone in the world who wouldn't misunderstand it,\" said\nshe, without the least feeling of embarrassment.\n\n\"Just so,\" said he.  \"And I want you to live in such a way that I can\ncome to call.  We must arrange things so that you will take your own\nname--\"\n\n\"I intend to use the name Mary Stevens in my work,\" she interrupted.\n\n\"But there mustn't be any concealment, any mystery to excite curiosity\nand scandal--\"\n\nThis time the interruption was her expression.  He turned to see what\nhad startled her, and saw in the doorway of the drawing-room the\ngrotesquely neat and stylish figure of the little general.  Before\neither could speak he said:\n\n\"How d'you do, Mr. Baird?  You'll pardon me if I ask you to leave me\nalone with my WIFE.\"\n\nStanley met the situation with perfect coolness. \"How are you,\nGeneral?\" said he.  \"Certainly, I was just going.\"  He extended his\nhand to Mildred, said in a correct tone of conventional friendliness,\n\"Then you'll let me know when you're settled?\"  He bowed, moved toward\nthe door, shook hands with the general, and passed out, giving from\nstart to finish a model example of a man of the world extricating\nhimself from an impossible situation and leaving it the better for his\nhaving been entangled.  To a man of Siddall's incessant and clumsy\nself-consciousness such unaffected ease could not but be proof positive\nof Mildred's innocence--unless he had overheard.  And his first words\nconvinced her that he had not.  Said he:\n\n\"So you sent for your old admirer?\"\n\n\"I ran across him accidentally,\" replied Mildred.\n\n\"I know,\" said the little general.  \"My men picked you up at the pier\nand haven't lost sight of you since. It's fortunate that I've kept\nmyself informed, or I might have misunderstood that chap's being here.\"\nA queer, cloudy look came into his eyes.  \"I must give him a warning\nfor safety's sake.\"  He waved his hand in dismissal of such an\nunimportant trifle as the accidental Baird.  He went on, his wicked\neyes bent coldly and dully upon her:  \"Do you know what kind of a house\nthis is?\"\n\n\"Stanley Baird urged me to leave,\" replied she. \"But I shall stay until\nI find a better--and that's not easy.\"\n\n\"Yes, my men have reported to me on the difficulties you've had.  It\nwas certainly fortunate for you that I had them look after you.\nOtherwise I'd never have understood your landing in this sort of a\nhouse. You are ready to come with me?\"\n\n\"Your secretary explained that if I left the hotel it was the end.\"\n\n\"He told you that by my orders.\"\n\n\"So he explained,\" said Mildred.  She seated herself, overcome by a\nsudden lassitude that was accompanied not by fear, but by indifference.\n\"Won't you sit down? I am willing to hear what you have to say.\"\n\nThe little general, about to sit, was so astonished that he\nstraightened and stiffened himself.  \"In consenting to overlook your\nconduct and take you back I have gone farther than I ever intended.  I\nhave taken into consideration your youth and inexperience.\"\n\n\"But I am not going back,\" said Mildred.\n\nThe little general slowly seated himself.  \"You have less than two\nhundred and fifty dollars left,\" said he.\n\n\"Really?  Your spies know better than I.\"\n\n\"I have seen Presbury.  He assures me that in no circumstances will he\nand your mother take you back.\"\n\n\"They will not have the chance to refuse,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"As for your brother--\"\n\n\"I have no brother,\" said she coldly.\n\n\"Then you are coming back with me.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mildred.  \"I should\"--she cast about for an impressive\nalternative--\"I should stay on here, rather.\"\n\nThe little general--his neat varnished leather and be-spatted shoes\njust touched the floor--examined his highly polished top-hat at several\nangles.  Finally he said:  \"You need not fear that your misconduct will\nbe remembered against you.  I shall treat you in every way as my wife.\nI shall assume that your--your flight was an impulse that you regret.\"\n\n\"I shan't go back,\" said Mildred.  \"Nothing you could offer would\nchange me.\"\n\n\"I cannot make any immediate concession on the--the matter that caused\nyou to go,\" pursued he, as if she had not spoken, \"but if I see that\nyou have reliability and good sense, I'll agree to give you an\nallowance later.\"\n\nMildred eyed him curiously.  \"Why are you making these offers, these\nconcessions?\" she said.  \"You think everyone in the world is a fool\nexcept yourself.  You're greatly deceived.  I know that you don't mean\nwhat you've been saying.  I know that if you got me in your power\nagain, you would do something frightful. I've seen through that mask\nyou wear.  I know the kind of man you are.\"\n\n\"If you know that,\" said the general in his even slow way, monotonous,\nalmost lifeless, \"you know you'd better come with me than stand out\nagainst me.\"\n\nShe did not let him see how this struck terror into her.  She said: \"No\nmatter what you might do to me, when I'm away from you, it would be\nless than you'd do with me under your roof.  At any rate, it'd seem\nless.\"\n\nThe general reflected, decided to change to another point:  \"You made a\nbargain with me.  You've broken it.  I never let anyone break a bargain\nwith me without making them regret it.  I'm giving you a chance to keep\nyour bargain.\"\n\nShe was tempted to discuss, but she could not find the words, or the\nstrength.  Besides, how futile to discuss with such a man.  She sank\nback in her chair wearily.  \"I shall never go back,\" she said.\n\nHe looked at her, his face devoid of expression, but she had a sense of\nmalignance unutterable eying her from behind a screen.  He said:  \"I\nsee you've misunderstood my generosity.  You think I'm weak where you\nare concerned because I've come to you instead of doing as I said and\nmaking you come to me.\"  He rose. \"Well, my offer to you is closed. And\nonce more I say, you will come to me and ask to be taken back.  I may\nor may not take you back.  It depends on how I'll feel at that time.\"\n\nSlowly, with his ludicrously pompous strut, he marched to the\ndrawing-room door.  She had not felt like smiling, but if there had\nbeen any such inclination it would have fled before the countenance\nthat turned upon her at the threshold.  It was the lean, little face\nwith the funny toupee and needle-like mustache and imperial, but behind\nit lay a personality like the dull, cold, yellow eyes of the devil-fish\nambushed in the hazy mass of dun-colored formlessness of collapsed body\nand tentacles.  He said:\n\n\"You'd best be careful how you conduct yourself. You'll be under\nconstant observation.  And any friends you make--they'd do well to\navoid you.\"\n\nHe was gone.  She sat without the power of motion, without the power of\nthought.  After a time--perhaps long, perhaps short, she did not\nknow--Mrs. Belloc came in and entered upon a voluble apology for the\nmaid's having shown \"the little gentleman\" into the drawing-room when\nanother was already there. \"That maid's as green as spring corn,\" said\nshe. \"Such a thing never happened in my house before. And it'll never\nhappen again.  I do hope it didn't cause trouble.\"\n\n\"It was my husband,\" said Mildred.  \"I had to see him some time.\"\n\n\"He's certainly a very elegant little gentleman,\" said Mrs. Belloc.  \"I\nrather like small men, myself.\"\n\nMildred gazed at her vaguely and said, \"Tell me--a rich man, a very\nrich man--if he hates anyone, can he make trouble?\"\n\n\"Money can do anything in this town,\" replied Mrs. Belloc.  \"But\nusually rich men are timid and stingy. If they weren't, they'd make us\nall cringe.  As it is, I've heard some awful stories of how men and\nwomen who've got some powerful person down on them have been hounded.\"\n\nMildred turned deathly sick.  \"I think I'll go to my room,\" she said,\nrising uncertainly and forcing herself toward the door.\n\nMrs. Belloc's curiosity could not restrain itself. \"You're leaving?\"\nshe asked.  \"You're going back to your husband?\"\n\nShe was startled when the girl abruptly turned on her and cried with\nflashing eyes and voice strong and vibrant with passion:  \"Never!\nNever!  No matter what comes--NEVER!\"\n\n\nThe rest of the day and that night she hid in her room and made no\neffort to resist the terror that preyed upon her.  Just as our strength\nis often the source of weakness, so our weaknesses often give birth to\nstrength. Her terror of the little general, given full swing, shrieked\nand grimaced itself into absurdity.  She was ashamed of her orgy, was\nlaughing at it as the sun and intoxicating air of a typical New York\nmorning poured in upon her.  She accepted Mrs. Belloc's invitation to\ntake a turn through the park and up Riverside Drive in a taxicab, came\nback restored to her normal state of blind confidence in the future.\nAbout noon Stanley Baird telephoned.\n\n\"We must not see each other again for some time,\" said he.  \"I rather\nsuspect that you--know--who may be having you watched.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it,\" said she.  \"He warned me.\"\n\n\"Don't let that disturb you,\" pursued Stanley.  \"A man--a singing\nteacher--his name's Eugene Jennings--will call on you this afternoon at\nthree.  Do exactly as he suggests.  Let him do all the talking.\"\n\nShe had intended to tell Baird frankly that she thought, indeed knew,\nthat it was highly dangerous for him to enter into her affairs in any\nway, and to urge him to draw off.  She felt that it was only fair to\nact so toward one who had been unselfishly generous to her.  But now\nthat the time for speaking had come, she found herself unable to speak.\nOnly by flatly refusing to have anything to do with his project could\nshe prevail upon him.  To say less than that she had completely and\nfinally changed her mind would sound, and would be, insincere.  And\nthat she could not say. She felt how noble it would be to say this, how\nselfish, and weak, too, it was to cling to him, possibly to involve him\nin disagreeable and even dangerous complications, but she had no\nstrength to do what she would have denounced another as base for not\ndoing.  Instead of the lofty words that flow so freely from the lips of\nstage and fiction heroines, instead of the words that any and every\nreader of this history would doubtless have pronounced in the same\ncircumstances, she said:\n\n\"You're quite sure you want to go on?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" came instantly back over the wire.\n\n\"He is a very, very relentless man,\" replied she.\n\n\"Did he try to frighten you?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he succeeded.\"\n\n\"You're not going back on the career!\" exclaimed he excitedly.  \"I'll\ncome down there and--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried she.  \"I was simply giving you a chance to free\nyourself.\"  She felt sure of him now. She scrambled toward the heights\nof moral grandeur. \"I want you to stop.  I've no right to ask you to\ninvolve yourself in my misfortunes.  Stanley, you mustn't.  I can't\nallow it.\"\n\n\"Oh, fudge!\" laughed he.  \"Don't give me these scares.  Don't\nforget--Jennings at three.  Good-by and good luck.\"\n\nAnd he rang off that she might have no chance on impulse to do herself\nmischief with her generous thoughtfulness for him.  She felt rather\nmean, but not nearly so mean as she would have felt had she let the\nopportunity go by with no generous word said.  \"And no doubt my\naversion for that little wretch,\" thought she, \"makes me think him more\nterrible than he is. After all, what can he do?  Watch me--and discover\nnothing, because there'll be nothing to discover.\"\n\nJennings came exactly at three--came with the air of a man who wastes\nno one's time and lets no one waste his time.  He was a youngish man of\nforty or thereabouts, with a long sharp nose, a large tight mouth, and\neyes that seemed to be looking restlessly about for money.  That they\nhad not looked in vain seemed to be indicated by such facts as that he\ncame in a private brougham and that he was most carefully dressed,\napparently with the aid of a valet.\n\n\"Miss Stevens,\" he said with an abrupt bow, before Mildred had a chance\nto speak, \"you have come to New York to take singing lessons--to\nprepare yourself for the stage.  And you wish a comfortable place to\nlive and to work.\"  He extended his gloved hand, shook hers frigidly,\ndropped it.  \"We shall get on--IF you work, but only if you work.  I do\nnot waste myself upon triflers.\"  He drew a card from his pocket.  \"If\nyou will go to see the lady whose name and address are written on this\ncard, I think you will find the quarters you are looking for.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Come to me--my address is on the card, also--at half-past ten on\nSaturday.  We will then lay out your work.\"\n\n\"If you find I have a voice worth while,\" Mildred ventured.\n\n\"That, of course,\" said Mr. Jennings curtly. \"Until half-past ten on\nSaturday, good day.\"\n\nAgain he gave the abrupt foreign bow and, while Mildred was still\nstruggling with her surprise and confusion, she saw him, through the\nwindow, driving rapidly away.  Mrs. Belloc came drifting through the\nroom; she had the habit of looking about whenever there were new\nvisitors, and in her it was not irritating because her interest was\ninnocent and sympathetic. Said Mildred:\n\n\"Did you see that man, Mrs. Belloc?\"\n\n\"What an extraordinary nose he had,\" replied she.\n\n\"Yes, I noticed that,\" said Mildred.  \"But it was the only thing I did\nnotice.  He is a singing teacher--Mr. Jennings.\"\n\n\"Eugene Jennings?\"\n\n\"Yes, Eugene.\"\n\n\"He's the best known singing teacher in New York. He gets fifteen\ndollars a half-hour.\"\n\n\"Then I simply can't take from him!\" exclaimed Mildred, before she\nthought.  \"That's frightful!\"\n\n\"Isn't it, though?\" echoed Mrs. Belloc.  \"I've heard his income is\nfifty thousand a year, what with lessons and coaching and odds and\nends.  There's a lot of them that do well, because so many fool women\nwith nothing to do cultivate their voices--when they can't sing a\nlittle bit.  But he tops them all.  I don't see how ANY teacher can put\nfifteen dollars of value into half an hour.  But I suppose he does, or\nhe wouldn't get it.  Still, his may be just another case of New York\nnerve.  This is the biggest bluff town in the world, I do believe.\nHere, you can get away with anything, I don't care what it is, if only\nyou bluff hard enough.\"\n\nAs there was no reason for delay and many reasons against it, Mildred\nwent at once to the address on the card Jennings had left.  She found\nMrs. Howell Brindley installed in a plain comfortable apartment in\nFifty-ninth Street, overlooking the park and high enough to make the\nnoise of the traffic endurable.  A Swedish maid, prepossessingly white\nand clean, ushered her into the little drawing-room, which was\nfurnished with more simplicity and individual taste than is usual\nanywhere in New York, cursed of the mania for useless and tasteless\nshowiness.  There were no messy draperies, no fussy statuettes, vases,\ngilt boxes, and the like. Mildred awaited the entrance of Mrs. Brindley\nhopefully.\n\nShe was not disappointed.  Presently in came a quietly-dressed,\nfrank-looking woman of a young forty--a woman who had by no means lost\nher physical freshness, but had gained charm of another and more\nenduring kind.  As she came forward with extended but not overeager\nhand, she said:\n\n\"I was expecting you, Mrs. Siddall--that is, Miss Stevens.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jennings did not say when I was to come.  If I am disturbing you--\"\n\nMrs. Brindley hastened to assure her that her visit was quite\nconvenient.  \"I must have someone to share the expense of this\napartment with me, and I want the matter settled.  Mr. Jennings has\nexplained about you to me, and now that I've seen you--\" here she\nsmiled charmingly--\"I am ready to say that it is for you to say.\"\n\nMildred did not know how to begin.  She looked at Mrs. Brindley with\nappeal in her troubled young eyes.\n\n\"You no doubt wish to know something about me,\" said Mrs. Brindley. \"My\nhusband was a composer--a friend of Mr. Jennings.  He died two years\nago. I am here in New York to teach the piano.  What the lessons will\nbring, with my small income, will enable me to live--if I can find\nsomeone to help out at the expenses here.  As I understand it, you are\nwilling to pay forty dollars a week, I to run the house, pay all the\nbills, and so on--all, of course, if you wish to come here.\"\n\nMildred made a not very successful attempt to conceal her embarrassment.\n\n\"Perhaps you would like to look at the apartment?\" suggested Mrs.\nBrindley.\n\n\"Thank you, yes,\" said Mildred.\n\nThe tour of the apartment--two bedrooms, dining-room, kitchen,\nsitting-room, large bath-room, drawing-room--took only a few minutes,\nbut Mildred and Mrs. Brindley contrived to become much better\nacquainted. Said Mildred, when they were in the drawing-room again:\n\n\"It's most attractive--just what I should like. What--how much did Mr.\nJennings say?\"\n\n\"Forty dollars a week.\"  She colored slightly and spoke with the\nnervousness of one not in the habit of discussing money matters.  \"I do\nnot see how I could make it less.  That is the fair share of the--\"\n\n\"Oh, I think that is most reasonable,\" interrupted Mildred.  \"And I\nwish to come.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley gave an almost childlike sigh of relief and smiled\nradiantly.  \"Then it's settled,\" said she. \"I've been so nervous about\nit.\"  She looked at Mildred with friendly understanding.  \"I think you\nand I are somewhat alike about practical things.  You've not had much\nexperience, either, have you?  I judge so from the fact that Mr.\nJennings is looking after everything for you.\"\n\n\"I've had no experience at all,\" said Mildred. \"That is why I'm\nhesitating.  I'm wondering if I can afford to pay so much.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley laughed.  \"Mr. Jennings wished to fix it at sixty a week,\nbut I insisted that forty was enough,\" said she.\n\nMildred colored high with embarrassment.  How much did Mrs. Brindley\nknow?--or how little?  She stammered:  \"Well, if Mr. Jennings says it\nis all right, I'll come.\"\n\n\"You'll let me know to-morrow?  You can telephone Mr. Jennings.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll let you know to-morrow.  I'm almost sure I'll come.  In\nfact, I'm quite sure.  And--I think we shall get on well together.\"\n\n\"We can help each other,\" said Mrs. Brindley.  \"I don't care for\nanything in the world but music.\"\n\n\"I want to be that way,\" said Mildred.  \"I shall be that way.\"\n\n\"It's the only sure happiness--to care for something, for some THING,\"\nsaid Mrs. Brindley.  \"People die, or disappoint one, or become\nestranged.  But when one centers on some kind of work, it gives\npleasure always--more and more pleasure.\"\n\n\"I am so afraid I haven't voice enough, or of the right kind,\" said\nMildred.  \"Mr. Jennings is going to try me on Saturday.  Really I've no\nright to settle anything until he has given his opinion.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley smiled with her eyes only, and Mildred wondered.\n\n\"If he should say that I wouldn't do,\" she went on, \"I'd not know which\nway to turn.\"\n\n\"But he'll not say that,\" said Mrs. Brindley.  \"You can sing, can't\nyou?  You have sung?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"Then you'll be accepted by him.  And it will take him a long time to\nfind out whether you'll do for a professional.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I sing very badly.\"\n\n\"That will not matter.  You'll sing better than at least half of\nJennings's pupils.\"\n\n\"Then he doesn't take only those worth while?\"\n\nMrs. Brindley looked amused.  \"How would he live if he did that?  It's\na teacher's business to teach. Learning--that's the pupil's lookout. If\nteachers taught only those who could and would learn, how would they\nlive?\"\n\n\"Then I'll not know whether I'll do!\" exclaimed Mildred.\n\n\"You'll have to find out for yourself,\" said Mrs. Brindley.  \"No one\ncan tell you.  Anyone's opinion might be wrong.  For example, I've\nknown Jennings, who is a very good judge, to be wrong--both ways.\"\nHesitatingly:  \"Why not sing for me?  I'd like to hear.\"\n\n\"Would you tell me what you honestly thought?\" said Mildred.\n\nMrs. Brindley laughingly shook her head. Mildred liked her honesty.\n\"Then it'd be useless to sing for you,\" said she.  \"I'm not vain about\nmy voice. I'd simply like to make a living by it, if I could.  I'll\neven confess that there are many things I care for more than for music.\nDoes that prove that I can never sing professionally?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" Mrs. Brindley assured her.  \"It'd be strange if a girl of\nyour age cared exclusively for music.  The passion comes with the work,\nwith progress, success.  And some of the greatest--that is, the most\nfamous and best paid--singers never care much about music, except as a\nvanity, and never understand it.  A singer means a person born with a\ncertain shape of mouth and throat, a certain kind of vocal chords.  The\nrest may be natural or acquired.  It's the instrument that makes the\nsinger, not brains or temperament.\"\n\n\"Do let me sing for you,\" said Mildred.  \"I think it will help me.\"\n\nBetween them they chose a little French song--\"Chanson d'Antonine\"--and\nMrs. Brindley insisted on her playing her own accompaniment.  \"I wish\nto listen,\" said she, \"and I can't if I play.\"\n\nMildred was surprised at her own freedom from nervousness.  She sang\nneither better nor worse than usual--sang in the clear and pleasant\nsoprano which she flattered herself was not unmusical.  When she\nfinished she said:\n\n\"That's about as I usually sing.  What do you think?\"\n\nMrs. Brindley reflected before she replied:  \"I BELIEVE it's worth\ntrying.  If I were you, I should keep on trying, no matter what anyone\nsaid.\"\n\nMildred was instantly depressed.  \"You think Mr. Jennings may reject\nme?\" she asked.\n\n\"I KNOW he will not,\" replied Mrs. Brindley.  \"Not as long as you can\npay for the lessons.  But I was thinking of the real thing--of whether\nyou could win out as a singer.\"\n\n\"And you don't think I can?\" said Mildred.\n\n\"On the contrary, I believe you can,\" replied Mrs. Brindley.  \"A singer\nmeans so much besides singing. The singing is the smallest part of it.\nYou'll understand when you get to work.  I couldn't explain now. But I\ncan say that you ought to go ahead.\"\n\nMildred, who had her share of vanity, had hoped for some enthusiasm.\nMrs. Brindley's judicial tone was a severe blow.  She felt a little\nresentful, began to cast about for vanity-consoling reasons for Mrs.\nBrindley's restraint.  \"She means well,\" she said to herself, \"but\nshe's probably just a tiny bit jealous.  She's not so young as she once\nwas, and she hasn't the faintest hope of ever being anything more than\na piano-teacher.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley showed that she had more than an inkling of Mildred's\nframe of mind by going on to say in a gentle, candid way:  \"I want to\nhelp you.  So I shall be careful not to encourage you to believe too\nmuch in what you have.  That would prevent you from getting what you\nneed.  You must remember, you are no longer a drawing-room singer, but\na candidate for the profession.  That's a very different thing.\"\n\nMildred saw that she was mistaken, that Mrs. Brindley was honest and\nfrank and had doubtless told her the exact truth.  But her vanity\nremained sore.  Never before had anyone said any less of her singing\nthan that it was wonderful, marvelous, equal to a great deal that\npassed for fine in grand opera.  She had known that this was\nexaggeration, but she had not known how grossly exaggerated.  Thus,\nthis her first experience of the professional attitude was galling.\nOnly her unusual good sense saved her from being angry with Mrs.\nBrindley.  And it was that same good sense that moved her presently to\ntry to laugh at herself.  With a brave attempt to smile gayly she said:\n\n\"You don't realize how you've taken me down.  I had no idea I was so\nconceited about my singing.  I can't truthfully say I like your\nfrankness, but there's a part of me that's grateful to you for it, and\nwhen I get over feeling hurt, I'll be grateful through and through.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley's face lighted up beautifully.  \"You'll DO!\" she cried.\n\"I'm sure you'll do.  I've been waiting and watching to see how you\nwould take my criticism. That's the test--how they take criticism.  If\nthey don't take it at all, they'll not go very far, no matter how\ntalented they are.  If they take it as you've taken it, there's\nhope--great hope.  Now, I'm not afraid to tell you that you sang\nsplendidly for an amateur--that you surprised me.\"\n\n\"Don't spoil it all,\" said Mildred.  \"You were right; I can't sing.\"\n\n\"Not for grand opera, not for comic opera even,\" replied Mrs. Brindley.\n\"But you will sing, and sing well, in one or the other, if you work.\"\n\n\"You really mean that?\" said Mildred.\n\n\"If you work intelligently and persistently,\" said Mrs. Brindley.\n\"That's a big if--as you'll discover in a year or so.\"\n\n\"You'll see,\" said Mildred confidently.  \"Why, I've nothing else to do,\nand no other hope.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley's smile had a certain sadness in it. She said:\n\n\"It's the biggest if in all this world.\"\n\n\n\nV\n\nAT Mrs. Belloc's a telephone message from Jennings was awaiting her; he\nwould call at a quarter-past eight and would detain Miss Stevens only a\nmoment.  And at eight fifteen exactly he rang the bell.  This time\nMildred was prepared; she refused to be disconcerted by his abrupt\nmanner and by his long sharp nose that seemed to warn away, to threaten\naway, even to thrust away any glance seeking to investigate the rest of\nhis face or his personality.  She looked at him candidly, calmly, and\nseeingly.  Seeingly.  With eyes that saw as they had never seen before.\nPerhaps from the death of her father, certainly from the beginning of\nSiddall's courtship, Mildred had been waking up.  There is a part of\nour nature--the active and aggressive part--that sleeps all our lives\nlong or becomes atrophied if we lead lives of ease and secure\ndependence.  It is the important part of us, too--the part that\ndetermines character.  The thing that completed the awakening of\nMildred was her acquaintance with Mrs. Belloc. That positive and\nfinely-poised lady fascinated her, influenced her powerfully--gave her\njust what she needed at the particular moment.  The vital moments in\nlife are not the crises over which shallow people linger, but are the\nmoments where we met and absorbed the ideas that enabled us to weather\nthese crises.  The acquaintance with Mrs. Belloc was one of those vital\nmoments; for, Mrs. Belloc's personality--her look and manner, what she\nsaid and the way she said it--was a proffer to Mildred of invaluable\nlessons which her awakening character eagerly absorbed.  She saw\nJennings as he was.  She decided that he was of common origin, that his\nvanity was colossal and aquiver throughout with sensitiveness; that he\nbelonged to the familiar type of New-Yorker who succeeds by bluffing.\nAlso, she saw or felt a certain sexlessness or indifference to sex--and\nthis she later understood.  Men whose occupation compels them\nconstantly to deal with women go to one extreme or the other--either\nbecome acutely sensitive to women as women or become utterly\nindifferent, unless their highly discriminated taste is appealed\nto--which cannot happen often.  Jennings, teaching only women because\nonly women spending money they had not earned and could not earn would\ntolerate his terms and his methods, had, as much through necessity as\nthrough inclination, gone to the extreme of lack of interest in all\nmatters of sex.  One look at him and the woman who had come with the\nidea of offering herself in full or part payment for lessons drooped in\ninstinctive discouragement.\n\nJennings hastened to explain to Mildred that she need not hesitate\nabout closing with Mrs. Brindley.  \"Your lessons are arranged for,\"\nsaid he.  \"There has been put in the Plaza Trust Company to your credit\nthe sum of five thousand dollars.  This gives you about a hundred\ndollars a week for your board and other personal expenses.  If that is\nnot enough, you will let me know. But I estimated that it would be\nenough.  I do not think it wise for young women entering upon the\npreparation for a serious career to have too much money.\"\n\n\"It is more than enough,\" murmured the girl.  \"I know nothing about\nthose things, but it seems to me--\"\n\n\"You can use as little of it as you like,\" interrupted Jennings, rising.\n\nMildred felt as though she had been caught and exposed in a\nhypocritical protest.  Jennings was holding out something toward her.\nShe took it, and he went on:\n\n\"That's your check-book.  The bank will send you statements of your\naccount, and will notify you when any further sums are added.  Now, I\nhave nothing more to do with your affairs--except, of course, the\nartistic side--your development as a singer.  You've not forgotten your\nappointment?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mildred, like a primary school-child before a formidable\nteacher.\n\n\"Be prompt, please.  I make no reduction for lessons wholly or partly\nmissed.  The half-hour I shall assign to you belongs to you.  If you do\nnot use it, that is your affair.  At first you will probably be like\nall women--careless about your appointments, coming with lessons\nunprepared, telephoning excuses.  But if you are serious you will soon\nfall into the routine.\" \"I shall try to be regular,\" murmured Mildred.\n\nJennings apparently did not hear.  \"I'm on my way to the opera-house,\"\nsaid he.  \"One of my old pupils is appearing in a new role, and she is\nnervous.  Good night.\"\n\nOnce more that swift, quiet exit, followed almost instantaneously by\nthe sound of wheels rolling away. Never had she seen such rapidity of\nmotion without loss of dignity.  \"Yes, he's a fraud,\" she said to\nherself, \"but he's a good one.\"\n\nThe idea of a career had now become less indefinite. It was still\nwithout any attraction--not because of the toil it involved, for that\nmade small impression upon her who had never worked and had never seen\nanyone work, but because a career meant cutting herself off from\neverything she had been brought up to regard as fit and proper for a\nlady.  She was ashamed of this; she did not admit its existence even to\nherself, and in her talks with Baird about the career she had professed\nexactly the opposite view.  Yet there it was--nor need she have been\nashamed of a feeling that is instilled into women of her class from\nbabyhood as part of their ladylike education.  The career had not\nbecome definite. She could not imagine herself out on a stage in some\nsort of a costume, with a painted face, singing before an audience.\nStill, the career was less indefinite than when it had no existence\nbeyond Stanley Baird's enthusiasm and her own whipped-up pretense of\nenthusiasm.\n\nShe shrank from the actual start, but at the same time was eager for\nit.  Inaction began to fret her nerves, and she wished to be doing\nsomething to show her appreciation of Stanley Baird's generosity.  She\ntelephoned Mrs. Brindley that she would come in the morning, and then\nshe told her landlady.\n\nMrs. Belloc was more than regretful; she was distressed.  Said she:\n\"I've taken a tremendous fancy to you, and I hate to give you up.  I'd\ndo most anything to keep you.\"\n\nMildred explained that her work compelled her to go.\n\n\"That's very interesting,\" said Mrs. Belloc.  \"If I were a few years\nyounger, and hadn't spent all my energy in teaching school and putting\nthrough that marriage, I'd try to get on the stage, myself.  I don't\nwant to lose sight of you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll come to see you from time to time.\"\n\n\"No, you won't,\" said Mrs. Belloc practically.  \"No more than I'd come\nto see you.  Our lives lie in different directions, and in New York\nthat means we'll never have time to meet.  But we may be thrown\ntogether again, some time.  As I've got a twenty years' lease on this\nhouse, I guess you'll have no trouble in finding me.  I suppose I could\nlook you up through Professor Jennings?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mildred.  Then impulsively, \"Mrs. Belloc, there's a reason\nwhy I'd like to change without anyone's knowing what has become of\nme--I mean, anyone that might be--watching me.\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly,\" said Mrs. Belloc with a ready sympathy that\nmade Mildred appreciate the advantages of the friendship of\nunconventional, knock-about people.  \"Nothing could be easier.  You've\ngot no luggage but that bag.  I'll take it up to the Grand Central\nStation and check it, and bring the check back here.  You can send for\nit when you please.\"\n\n\"But what about me?\" said Mildred.\n\n\"I was coming to that.  You walk out of here, say, about half an hour\nafter I go in the taxi.  You walk through to the corner of Lexington\nAvenue and Thirty-seventh Street--there aren't any cabs to be had\nthere. I'll be waiting in the taxi, and we'll make a dash up the East\nSide and I can drop you at some quiet place in the park and go on--and\nyou can walk to your new address.  How does that strike you?\"\n\nMildred expressed her admiration.  The plan was carried out, as Mrs.\nBelloc--a born genius at all forms of intrigue--had evolved it in\nperfection on the spur of the moment.  As they went up the far East\nSide, Mrs. Belloc, looking back through the little rear window, saw a\ntaxi a few blocks behind them.  \"We haven't given them the slip yet,\"\nsaid she, \"but we will in the park.\"  They entered the park at East\nNinetieth Street, crossed to the West Drive.  Acting on Mrs. Belloc's\ninstructions, the motorman put on full speed--with due regard to the\noccasional policeman.  At a sharp turning near the Mall, when the taxi\ncould be seen from neither direction, he abruptly stopped.  Out sprang\nMildred and disappeared behind the bushes completely screening the walk\nfrom the drive.  At once the taxi was under-way again.  She, waiting\nwhere the screen of bushes was securely thick, saw the taxi that had\nfollowed them in the East Side flash by--in pursuit of Mrs. Belloc\nalone.\n\nShe was free--at least until some mischance uncovered her to the little\ngeneral.  At Mrs. Brindley's she found a note awaiting her--a note from\nStanley Baird:\n\n\nDEAR MILDRED:\n\nI'm of for the Far West, and probably shall not be in town again until\nthe early summer.  The club forwards my mail and repeats telegrams as\nmarked.  Go in and win, and don't hesitate to call on me if you need\nme.  No false pride, PLEASE!  I'm getting out of the way because it's\nobviously best for the present.\n\nSTANLEY.\n\n\nAs she finished, her sense of freedom was complete. She had not\nrealized how uneasy she was feeling about Stanley.  She did not doubt\nhis generosity, did not doubt that he genuinely intended to leave her\nfree, and she believed that his delicacy was worthy of his generosity.\nStill, she was constantly fearing lest circumstances should thrust them\nboth--as much against his will as hers--into a position in which she\nwould have to choose between seeming, not to say being, ungrateful, and\nplaying the hypocrite, perhaps basely, with him. The little general\neluded, Stanley voluntarily removed; she was indeed free.  Now she\ncould work with an untroubled mind, could show Mrs. Brindley that\nintelligent and persistent work--her \"biggest if in all the world\"--was\nin fact a very simple matter.\n\nShe had not been settled at Mrs. Brindley's many hours before she\ndiscovered that not only was she free from all hindrances, but was to\nhave a positive and great help.  Mrs. Brindley's talent for putting\npeople at their ease was no mere drawing-room trick.\n\nShe made Mildred feel immediately at home, as she had not felt at home\nsince her mother introduced James Presbury into their house at Hanging\nRock.  Mrs. Brindley was absolutely devoid of pretenses.  When Mildred\nspoke to her of this quality in her she said:\n\n\"I owe that to my husband.  I was brought up like everybody else--to be\nmore or less of a poser and a hypocrite.  In fact, I think there was\nalmost nothing genuine about me.  My husband taught me to be myself, to\nbe afraid of nobody's opinion, to show myself just as I was and to let\npeople seek or avoid me as they saw fit.  He was that sort of man\nhimself.\"\n\n\"He must have been a remarkable man,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"He was,\" replied Mrs. Brindley.  \"But not attractive--at least not to\nme.  Our marriage was a mistake.  We quarreled whenever we were not at\nwork with the music.  If he had not died, we should have been\ndivorced.\"  She smiled merrily.  \"Then he would have hired me as his\nmusical secretary, and we'd have got on beautifully.\"\n\nMildred was still thinking of Mrs. Brindley's freedom from pretense.\n\"I've never dared be myself,\" confessed she.  \"I don't know what myself\nreally is like. I was thinking the other day how for one reason and\nanother I've been a hypocrite all my life.  You see, I've always been a\ndependent--have always had to please someone in order to get what I\nwanted.\"\n\n\"You can never be yourself until you have an independent income,\nhowever small,\" said Mrs. Brindley. \"I've had that joy only since my\nhusband died.  It's as well that I didn't have it sooner.  One is the\nbetter for having served an apprenticeship at self-repression and at\npretending to virtues one has not.  Only those who earn their freedom\nknow how to use it.  If I had had it ten or fifteen years ago I'd have\nbeen an intolerable tyrant, making everyone around me unhappy and\ntherefore myself.  The ideal world would be one where everyone was born\nfree and never knew anything else. Then, no one being afraid or having\nto serve, everyone would have to be considerate in order to get himself\ntolerated.\"\n\n\"I wonder if I really ever shall be able to earn a living?\" sighed\nMildred.\n\n\"You must decide that whatever you can make shall be for you a living,\"\nsaid the older woman.  \"I have lived on my fixed income, which is under\ntwo thousand a year.  And I am ready to do it again rather than\ntolerate anything or anybody that does not suit me.\"\n\n\"I shall have to be extremely careful,\" laughed Mildred.  \"I shall be a\ndreadful hypocrite with you.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley smiled; but underneath, Mildred saw--or perhaps\nfelt--that her new friend was indeed not one to be trifled with.  She\nsaid:\n\n\"You and I will get on.  We'll let each other alone. We have to be more\nor less intimate, but we'll never be familiar.\"\n\nAfter a time she discovered that Mrs. Brindley's first name was\nCyrilla, but Mrs. Brindley and Miss Stevens they remained to each other\nfor a long time--until circumstances changed their accidental intimacy\ninto enduring friendship.  Not to anticipate, in the course of that\nsame conversation Mildred said:\n\n\"If there is anything about me--about my life--that you wish me to\nexplain, I shall be glad to do so.\"\n\n\"I know all I wish to know,\" replied Cyrilla Brindley.  \"Your face and\nyour manner and your way of speaking tell me all the essentials.\"\n\n\"Then you must not think it strange when I say I wish no one to know\nanything about me.\"\n\n\"It will be impossible for you entirely to avoid meeting people,\" said\nCyrilla.  \"You must have some simple explanation about yourself, or you\nwill attract attention and defeat your object.\"\n\n\"Lead people to believe that I'm an orphan--perhaps of some obscure\nfamily--who is trying to get up in the world.  That is practically the\ntruth.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley laughed.  \"Quite enough for New York,\" said she.  \"It is\nnot interested in facts.  All the New-Yorker asks of you is, 'Can you\npay your bills and help me pay mine?'\"\n\nCompetent men are rare; but, thanks to the advantage of the male sex in\nhaving to make the struggle for a living, they are not so rare as\ncompetent women. Mrs. Brindley was the first competent woman Mildred\nhad ever known.  She had spent but a few hours with her before she\nbegan to appreciate what a bad atmosphere she had always breathed--bad\nfor a woman who has her way to make in the world, or indeed for any\nwoman not willing to be content as mere more or less shiftless, more or\nless hypocritical and pretentious, dependent and parasite.  Mrs.\nBrindley--well bred and well educated--knew all the little matters\nwhich Mildred had been taught to regard as the whole of a lady's\neducation.  But Mildred saw that these trifles were but a trifling\nincident in Mrs. Brindley's knowledge.  She knew real things, this\nwoman who was a thorough-going housekeeper and who trebled her income\nby giving music lessons a few hours a day to such pupils as she thought\nworth the teaching.  When she spoke, she always said something one of\nthe first things noticed by Mildred, who, being too lazy to think\nexcept as her naturally good mind insisted on exercising itself,\nusually talked simply to kill time and without any idea of getting\nanywhere.  But while Cyrilla--without in the least intending it--roused\nher to a painful sense of her own limitations, she did not discourage\nher.  Mildred also began to feel that in this new atmosphere of ideas,\nof work, of accomplishment, she would rapidly develop into a different\nsort of person.  It was extremely fortunate for her, thought she, that\nshe was living with such a person as Cyrilla Brindley.  In the old\natmosphere, or with any taint of it, she would have been unable to\nbecome a serious person.  She would simply have dawdled along,\ntwaddling about \"art\" and seriousness and careers and sacrifice,\ncontent with the amateur's methods and the amateur's results--and\ndeluding herself that she was making progress.  Now--It was as\ndifferent as public school from private school--public school where the\nmind is rudely stimulated, private school where it is sedulously\nmollycoddled.  She had come out of the hothouse into the open.\n\nAt first she thought that Jennings was to be as great a help to her as\nCyrilla Brindley.  Certainly if ever there was a man with the air of a\nworker and a place with the air of a workshop, that man and that place\nwere Eugene Jennings and his studio in Carnegie Hall. When Mildred\nentered, on that Saturday morning, at exactly half-past ten,\nJennings--in a plain if elegant house-suit--looked at her, looked at\nthe clock, stopped a girl in the midst of a burst of tremulous noisy\nmelody.\n\n\"That will do, Miss Bristow,\" said he.  \"You have never sung it worse.\nYou do not improve.  Another lesson like this, and we shall go back and\nbegin all over again.\"\n\nThe girl, a fattish, \"temperamental\" blonde, burst into tears.\n\n\"Kindly take that out into the hall,\" said Jennings coldly.  \"Your time\nis up.  We cannot waste Miss Stevens's time with your hysterics.\"\n\nMiss Bristow switched from tears to fury.  \"You brute!  You beast!\" she\nshrieked, and flung herself out of the room, slamming the door after\nher.  Jennings took a book from a pile upon a table, opened it, and set\nit on a music-stand.  Evidently Miss Bristow was forgotten--indeed, had\npassed out of his mind at half-past ten exactly, not to enter it again\nuntil she should appear at ten on Monday morning.  He said to Mildred:\n\n\"Now, we'll see what you can do.  Begin.\"\n\n\"I'm a little nervous,\" said Mildred with a shy laugh.  \"If you don't\nmind, I'd like to wait till I've got used to my surroundings.\"\n\nJennings looked at her.  The long sharp nose seemed to be rapping her\non the forehead like a woodpecker's beak on the bark of the tree.\n\"Begin,\" he said, pointing to the book.\n\nMildred flushed angrily.  \"I shall not begin until I CAN begin,\" said\nshe.  The time to show this man that he could not treat her brutally\nwas at the outset.\n\nJennings opened the door into the hall.  \"Good day, Miss Stevens,\" he\nsaid with his abrupt bow.\n\nMildred looked at him; he looked at her.  Her lip trembled, the hot\ntears flooded and blinded her eyes. She went unsteadily to the\nmusic-stand and tried to see the notes of the exercises.  Jennings\nclosed the door and seated himself at the far end of the room.  She\nbegan--a ridiculous attempt.  She stopped, gritted her teeth, began\nagain.  Once more the result was absurd; but this time she was able to\nkeep on, not improving, but maintaining her initial off-key quavering.\nShe stopped.\n\n\"You see,\" said she.  \"Shall I go on?\"\n\n\"Don't stop again until I tell you to, please,\" said he.\n\nShe staggered and stumbled and somersaulted through two pages of\nDO-RE-ME-FA-SOL-LA-SI.  Then he held up his finger.\n\n\"Enough,\" said he.\n\nSilence, an awful silence.  She recalled what Mrs. Belloc had told her\nabout him, what Mrs. Brindley had implied.  But she got no consolation.\nShe said timidly:\n\n\"Really, Mr. Jennings, I can do better than that. Won't you let me try\na song?\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" said he.  \"You can't stand.  You can't breathe.  You\ncan't open your mouth.  Naturally, you can't sing.\"\n\nShe dropped to a chair.\n\n\"Take the book, and go over the same thing, sitting,\" said he.\n\nShe began to remove her wraps.\n\n\"Just as you are,\" he commanded.  \"Try to forget yourself.  Try to\nforget me.  Try to forget what a brute I am, and what a wonderful\nsinger you are.  Just open your mouth and throw the notes out.\"\n\nShe was rosy with rage.  She was reckless.  She sang.  At the end of\nthree pages he stopped her with an enthusiastic hand-clapping.  \"Good!\nGood!\" he cried.  \"I'll take you.  I'll make a singer of you. Yes, yes,\nthere's something to work on.\"\n\nThe door opened.  A tall, thin woman with many jewels and a superb fur\nwrap came gliding in.  Jennings looked at the clock.  The hands pointed\nto eleven. Said he to Mildred:\n\n\"Take that book with you.  Practice what you've done to-day.  Learn to\nkeep your mouth open.  We'll go into that further next time.\"  He was\nholding the door open for her.  As she passed out, she heard him say:\n\n\"Ah, Mrs. Roswell.  We'll go at that third song first.\"\n\nThe door closed.  Reviewing all that had occurred, Mildred decided that\nshe must revise her opinion of Jennings.  A money-maker he no doubt\nwas.  And why not?  Did he not have to live?  But a teacher also, and a\ngreat teacher.  Had he not destroyed her vanity at one blow, demolished\nit?--yet without discouraging her.  And he went straight to the bottom\nof things--very different from any of the teachers she used to have\nwhen she was posing in drawing-rooms as a person with a voice equal to\nthe most difficult opera, if only she weren't a lady and therefore not\nforced to be a professional singing person.  Yes, a great teacher--and\nin deadly earnest.  He would permit no trifling!  How she would have to\nwork!\n\nAnd she went to work with an energy she would not have believed she\npossessed.  He instructed her minutely in how to stand, in how to\nbreathe, in how to open her mouth and keep it open, in how to relax her\nthroat and leave it relaxed.  He filled every second of her half-hour;\nshe had never before realized how much time half an hour was, how use\ncould be made of every one of its eighteen hundred seconds.  She went\nto hear other teachers give lessons, and she understood why Jennings\ncould get such prices, could treat his pupils as he saw fit.  She\nbecame an extravagant admirer of him as a teacher, thought him a\ngenius, felt confident that he would make a great singer of her.  With\nthe second lesson she began to progress rapidly.  In a few weeks she\namazed herself.  At last she was really singing. Not in a great way,\nbut in the beginnings of a great way.  Her voice had many times the\npower of her drawing-room days.  Her notes were full and round, and\ncame without an effort.  Her former ideas of what constituted facial\nand vocal expression now seemed ridiculous to her.  She was now singing\nwithout making those dreadful faces which she had once thought charming\nand necessary.  Her lower register, always her best, was almost\nperfect.  Her middle register--the test part of a voice--was showing\nsigns of strength and steadiness and evenness.  And she was fast\ngetting a real upper register, as distinguished from the forced and\nshrieky high notes that pass as an upper register with most singers,\neven opera singers.  After a month of this marvelous forward march, she\nsang for Mrs. Brindley--sang the same song she had essayed at their\nfirst meeting.  When she finished, Mrs. Brindley said:\n\n\"Yes, you've done wonders.  I've been noticing your improvement as you\npracticed.  You certainly have a very different voice and method from\nthose you had a month ago,\" and so on through about five minutes of\ncritical and discriminating praise.\n\nMildred listened, wondering why her dissatisfaction, her irritation,\nincreased as Mrs. Brindley praised on and on.  Beyond question Cyrilla\nwas sincere, and was saying even more than Mildred had hoped she would\nsay.  Yet--  Mildred sat moodily measuring off octaves on the keyboard\nof the piano.  If she had been looking at her friend's face she would\nhave flared out in anger; for Cyrilla Brindley was taking advantage of\nher abstraction to observe her with friendly sympathy and sadness.\nPresently she concealed this candid expression and said:\n\n\"You are satisfied with your progress, aren't you, Miss Stevens?\"\n\nMildred flared up angrily.  \"Certainly!\" replied she.  \"How could I\nfail to be?\"\n\nMrs. Brindley did not answer--perhaps because she thought no answer was\nneeded or expected.  But to Mildred her silence somehow seemed a denial.\n\n\"If you can only keep what you've got--and go on,\" said Mrs. Brindley.\n\n\"Oh, I shall, never fear,\" retorted Mildred.\n\n\"But I do fear,\" said Mrs. Brindley.  \"I think it's always well to fear\nuntil success is actually won.  And then there's the awful fear of not\nbeing able to hold it.\"\n\nAfter a moment's silence Mildred, who could not hide away resentment\nagainst one she liked, said:  \"Why aren't YOU satisfied, Mrs. Brindley?\"\n\n\"But I am satisfied,\" protested Cyrilla.  \"Only it makes me afraid to\nsee YOU so well satisfied.  I've seen that often in people first\nstarting, and it's always dangerous.  You see, my dear, you've got a\nstraight-away hundred miles to walk.  Can't you see that it would be\npossible for you to become too much elated by the way you walked the\nfirst part of the first mile?\"\n\n\"Why do you try to discourage me?\" said Mildred.\n\nMrs. Brindley colored.  \"I do it because I want to save you from\ndespair a little later,\" said she.  \"But that is foolish of me.  I\nshall only irritate you against me.  I'll not do it again.  And please\ndon't ask my opinion.  If you do, I can't help showing exactly what I\nthink.\"\n\n\"Then you don't think I've done well?\" cried Mildred.\n\n\"Indeed you have,\" replied Cyrilla warmly.\n\n\"Then I don't understand.  What DO you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, and then I'll stop and you must not ask my opinion\nagain.  We live too close together to be able to afford to criticize\neach other.  What I meant was this:  You have done well the first part\nof the great task that's before you.  If you had done it any less well,\nit would have been folly for you to go on.\"\n\n\"That is, what I've done doesn't amount to anything?  Mr. Jennings\ndoesn't agree with you.\"\n\n\"Doubtless he's right,\" said Mrs. Brindley.  \"At any rate, we all agree\nthat you have shown that you have a voice.\"\n\nShe said this so simply and heartily that Mildred could not but be\nmollified.  Mrs. Brindley changed the subject to the song Mildred had\nsung, and Mildred stopped puzzling over the mystery of what she had\nmeant by her apparently enthusiastic words, which had yet diffused a\nchill atmosphere of doubt.\n\nShe was doing her scales so well that she became impatient of such\n\"tiresome child's play.\"  And presently Jennings gave her songs, and\ndid not discourage her when she talked of roles, of getting seriously\nat what, after all, she intended to do.  Then there came a week of vile\nweather, and Mildred caught a cold.  She neglected it.  Her voice left\nher.  Her tonsils swelled. She had a bad attack of ulcerated sore\nthroat.  For nearly three weeks she could not take a single one of the\nlessons, which were, nevertheless, paid for.  Jennings rebuked her\nsharply.\n\n\"A singer has no right to be sick,\" said he.\n\n\"You have a cold yourself,\" retorted she.\n\n\"But I am not a singer.  I've nothing that interferes with my work.\"\n\n\"It's impossible not to take cold,\" said Mildred. \"You are unreasonable\nwith me.\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.  \"Go get well,\" he said.\n\nThe sore throat finally yielded to the treatment of Dr. Hicks, the\nthroat-specialist.  His bill was seventy-five dollars.  But while the\nswelling in the tonsils subsided it did not depart.  She could take\nlessons again. Some days she sang as well as ever, and on those days\nJennings was charming.  Other days she sang atrociously, and Jennings\ntreated her as if she were doing it deliberately.  A third and worse\nstate was that of the days when she in the same half-hour alternately\nsang well and badly.  On those days Jennings acted like a lunatic.  He\nraved up and down the studio, all but swearing at her.  At first she\nwas afraid of him--withered under his scorn, feared he would throw open\nhis door and order her out and forbid her ever to enter again. But\ngradually she came to understand him--not enough to lose her fear of\nhim altogether, but enough to lose the fear of his giving up so\nprofitable a pupil.\n\nThe truth was that Jennings, like every man who succeeds at anything in\nthis world, operated upon a system to which he rigidly adhered.  He was\na man of small talent and knowledge, but of great, persistence and not\na little common sense.  He had tried to be a singer, had failed because\nhis voice was small and unreliable.  He had adopted teaching singing as\na means of getting a living.  He had learned just enough about it to\nenable him to teach the technical elements--what is set down in the\nbooks.  By observing other and older teachers he had got together a\nteaching system that was as good--and as bad--as any, and this he\ndubbed the Jennings Method and proceeded to exploit as the only one\nworth while.  When that method was worked out and perfected, he ceased\nlearning, ceased to give a thought to the professional side of his\nprofession, just as most professional men do.  He would have resented a\nsuggestion or a new idea as an attack upon the Jennings Method.  The\noverwhelming majority of the human race--indeed, all but a small\nhandful--have this passion for stagnation, this ferocity against\nchange. It is in large part due to laziness; for a new idea means work\nin learning it and in unlearning the old ideas that have been true\nuntil the unwelcome advent of the new.  In part also this resistance to\nthe new idea arises from a fear that the new idea, if tolerated, will\nput one out of business, will set him adrift without any means of\nsupport.  The coachman hates the automobile, the hand-worker hates the\nmachine, the orthodox preacher hates the heretic, the politician hates\nthe reformer, the doctor hates the bacteriologist and the chemist, the\nold woman hates the new--all these in varying proportions according to\nthe degree in which the iconoclast attacks laziness or livelihood.\nFinally we all hate any and all new ideas because they seem to imply\nthat we, who have held the old ideas, have been ignorant and stupid in\nso doing.  A new idea is an attack upon the vanity of everyone who has\nbeen a partisan of the old ideas and their established order.\n\nJennings, thoroughly human in thus closing his mind to all ideas about\nhis profession, was equally human in that he had his mind and his\nsenses opened full width to ideas on how to make more money.  If there\nhad been money in new ideas about teaching singing Jennings would not\nhave closed to them.  But the money was all in studying and learning\nhow better to handle the women--they were all women who came to him for\ninstruction.  His common sense warned him at the outset that the\nobviously easygoing teacher would not long retain his pupils.  On the\nother hand, he saw that the really severe teacher would not retain his\npupils, either.\n\nWho were these pupils?  In the first place, they were all ignorant, for\npeople who already know do not go to school to learn.  They had the\nuniversal delusion that a teacher can teach.  The fact is that a\nteacher is a well.  Some wells are full, others almost dry.  Some are\nso arranged that water cannot be got from them, others have attachments\nof various kinds, making the drawing of water more or less easy.  But\nnot from the best well with the latest pump attachment can one get a\ndrink unless one does the drinking oneself.  A teacher is rarely a\nwell.  The pupil must not only draw the water, but also drink it, must\nnot only teach himself, but also learn what he teaches.  Now we are all\nof us born thirsty for knowledge, and nearly all of us are born both\ncapable of teaching ourselves and capable of learning what we teach,\nthat is, of retaining and assimilating it.  There is such a thing as\nartificially feeding the mind, just as there is such a thing as\nartificially feeding the body; but while everyone knows that artificial\nfeeding of the body is a success only to a limited extent and for a\nbrief period, everyone believes that the artificial feeding of the mind\nis not only the best method, but the only method.  Nor does the\ndiscovery that the mind is simply the brain, is simply a part of the\nbody, subject to the body's laws, seem materially to have lessened this\nfatuous delusion.\n\nSome of Jennings's pupils--not more than two of the forty-odd were in\ngenuine earnest; that is, those two were educating themselves to be\nprofessional singers, were determined so to be, had limited time and\nmeans and endless capacity for work.  Others of the forty--about\nhalf-thought they were serious, though in fact the idea of a career was\nmore or less hazy.  They were simply taking lessons and toiling\naimlessly along, not less aimlessly because they indulged in vague talk\nand vaguer thought about a career.  The rest--the other half of the\nforty--were amusing themselves by taking singing lessons.  It killed\ntime, it gave them a feeling of doing something, it gave them a\nreputation of being serious people and not mere idlers, it gave them an\nexcuse for neglecting the domestic duties which they regarded as\ndegrading--probably because to do them well requires study and earnest,\nhard work.  The Jennings singing lesson, at fifteen dollars a\nhalf-hour, was rather an expensive hypocrisy; but the women who used it\nas a cloak for idleness as utter as the mere yawners and bridgers and\nshoppers had rich husbands or fathers.\n\nThus it appears that the Jennings School was a perfect microcosm, as\nthe scientists would say, of the human race--the serious very few,\ntoiling more or less successfully toward a definite goal; the many,\ncompelled to do something, and imagining themselves serious and\npurposeful as they toiled along toward nothing in particular but the\nnext lesson--that is, the next day's appointed task; the utterly idle,\nfancying themselves busy and important when in truth they were simply a\nfraud and an expense.\n\nJennings got very little from the deeply and genuinely serious.  One of\nthem he taught free, taking promissory notes for the lessons.  But he\nheld on to them because when they finally did teach themselves to sing\nand arrived at fame, his would be part of the glory--and glory meant\nmore and more pupils of the paying kinds.  His large income came from\nthe other two kinds of pupils, the larger part of it from the kind that\nhad no seriousness in them.  His problem was how to keep all these\npaying pupils and also keep his reputation as a teacher.  In solving\nthat problem he evolved a method that was the true Jennings's method.\nNot in all New York, filled as it is with people living and living well\nupon the manipulation of the weaknesses of their fellow beings--not in\nall New York was there an adroiter manipulator than Eugene Jennings. He\nwas harsh to brutality when he saw fit to be so--or, rather, when he\ndeemed it wise to be so.  Yet never had he lost a paying pupil through\nhis harshness. These were fashionable women--most delicate, sensitive\nladies--at whom he swore.  They wept, stayed on, advertised him as a\n\"wonderful serious teacher who won't stand any nonsense and doesn't\ncare a hang whether you stay or go--and he can teach absolutely anybody\nto sing!\"  He knew how to be gentle without seeming to be so; he knew\nhow to flatter without uttering a single word that did not seem to be\nreluctant praise or savage criticism; he knew how to make a lady with a\nlittle voice work enough to make a showing that would spur her to keep\non and on with him; he knew how to encourage a rich woman with no more\nsong than a peacock until she would come to him three times a week for\nmany years--and how he did make her pay for what he suffered in\nlistening to the hideous squawkings and yelpings she inflicted upon him!\n\nDid Jennings think himself a fraud?  No more than the next human being\nwho lives by fraud.  Is there any trade or profession whose\npractitioners, in the bottom of their hearts, do not think they are\nliving excusably and perhaps creditably?  The Jennings theory was that\nhe was a great teacher; that there were only a very few serious and\nworth-while seekers of the singing art; that in order to live and to\nteach these few, he had to receive the others; that, anyhow, singing\nwas a fine art for anyone to have and taking singing lessons made the\nworst voice a little less bad--or, at the least, singing was splendid\nfor the health.  One of his favorite dicta was, \"Every child should be\ntaught singing--for its health, if for nothing else.\"  And perhaps he\nwas right!  At any rate, he made his forty to fifty thousand a\nyear--and on days when he had a succession of the noisy, tuneless\nsquawkers, he felt that he more than earned every cent of it.\n\nMildred did not penetrate far into the secret of the money-making\nbranch of the Jennings method.  It was crude enough, too.  But are not\nall the frauds that fool the human race crude?  Human beings both\ncannot and will not look beneath surfaces.  All Mildred learned was\nthat Jennings did not give up paying pupils. She had not confidence\nenough in this discovery to put it to the test.  She did not dare\ndisobey him or shirk--even when she was most disposed to do so.  But\ngradually she ceased from that intense application she had at first\nbrought to her work.  She kept up the forms. She learned her lessons.\nShe did all that was asked. She seemed to be toiling as in the\nbeginning.  In reality, she became by the middle of spring a mere\nlesson-taker. Her interest in clothes and in going about revived.  She\nsaw in the newspapers that General Siddall had taken a party of friends\non a yachting trip around the world, so she felt that she was no longer\nbeing searched for, at least not vigorously.  She became acquainted\nwith smart, rich West Side women, taking lessons at Jennings's.  She\namused herself going about with them and with the \"musical\" men they\nattracted--amateur and semi-professional singers and players upon\ninstruments. She drew Mrs. Brindley into their society.  They had\nlittle parties at the flat in Fifty-ninth Street--the most delightful\nlittle parties imaginable--dinners and suppers, music, clever\nconversations, flirtations of a harmless but fascinating kind.  If\nanyone had accused Mildred of neglecting her work, of forgetting her\ncareer, she would have grown indignant, and if Mrs. Brindley had\noverheard, she would have been indignant for her. Mildred worked as\nmuch as ever.  She was making excellent progress.  She was doing all\nthat could be done. It takes time to develop a voice, to make an\nopera-singer. Forcing is dangerous, when it is not downright useless.\n\nIn May--toward the end of the month--Stanley Baird returned.  Mildred,\nwho happened to be in unusually good voice that day, sang for him at\nthe Jennings studio, and he was enchanted.  As the last note died away\nhe cried out to Jennings:\n\n\"She's a wonder, isn't she?\"\n\nJennings nodded.  \"She's got a voice,\" said he.\n\n\"She ought to go on next year.\"\n\n\"Not quite that,\" said Jennings.  \"We want to get that upper register\nright first.  And it's a young voice--she's very young for her age.  We\nmust be careful not to strain it.\"\n\n\"Why, what's a voice for if not to sing with?\" said Stanley.\n\n\"A fine voice is a very delicate instrument,\" replied the teacher.  He\nadded coldly, \"You must let me judge as to what shall be done.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" said Stanley in haste.\n\n\"She's had several colds this winter and spring,\" pursued Jennings.\n\"Those things are dangerous until the voice has its full growth.  She\nshould have two months' complete rest.\"\n\nJennings was going away for a two months' vacation. He was giving this\nadvice to all his pupils.\n\n\"You're right,\" said Baird.  \"Did you hear, Mildred?\"\n\n\"But I hate to stop work,\" objected Mildred.  \"I want to be doing\nsomething.  I'm very impatient of this long wait.\"\n\nAnd honest she was in this protest.  She had no idea of the state of\nher own mind.  She fancied she was still as eager as ever for the\ncareer, as intensely interested as ever in her work.  She did not dream\nof the real meaning of her content with her voice as it was, of her\nlack of uneasiness over the appalling fact that such voice as she had\nwas unreliable, came and went for no apparent reason.\n\n\"Absolute rest for two months,\" declared Jennings grimly.  \"Not a note\nuntil I return in August.\"\n\nMildred gave a resigned sigh.\n\nThere is much inveighing against hypocrisy, a vice unsightly rather\nthan desperately wicked.  And in the excitement about it its dangerous,\neven deadly near kinsman, self-deception, escapes unassailed.  Seven\ncardinal sins; but what of the eighth?--the parent of all the others,\nthe one beside which the children seem almost white?\n\n\nDuring the first few weeks Mildred had been careful about spending\nmoney.  Economy she did not understand; how could she, when she had\nnever had a lesson in it or a valuable hint about it?  So economy was\nimpossible.  The only way in which such people can keep order in their\nfinances is by not spending any money at all.  Mildred drew nothing,\nspent nothing. This, so long as she gave her whole mind to her work.\nBut after the first great cold, so depressing, so subtly undermining,\nshe began to go about, to think of, to need and to buy clothes, to\nspend money in a dozen necessary ways.  After all, she was simply\nborrowing the money.  Presently, she would be making a career, would be\nearning large sums.  She would pay back everything, with interest.\nStanley meant for her to use the money.  Really, she ought to use it.\nHow would her career be helped by her going about looking a dowd and a\nfrump?  She had always been used to the comforts of life.  If she\ndeprived herself of them, she would surely get into a frame of mind\nwhere her work would suffer.  No, she must lead the normal life of a\nwoman of her class.  To work all the time--why, as Jennings said, that\ntook away all the freshness, made one stale and unfit.  A little\ndistraction--always, of course, with musical people, people who talked\nand thought and did music--that sort of distraction was quite as much a\npart of her education as the singing lessons.  Mrs. Brindley, certainly\na sensible and serious woman if ever there was one--Mrs. Brindley\nbelieved so, and it must be so.\n\nAfter that illness and before she began to go about, she had fallen\ninto several fits of hideous blues, had been in despair as to the\nfuture.  As soon as she saw something of people--always the valuable,\nmusical sort of people--her spirits improved.  And when she got a few\nnew dresses--very simple and inexpensive, but stylish and charming--and\nthe hats, too, were successful--as soon as she was freshly arrayed she\nwas singing better and was talking hopefully of the career again.  Yes,\nit was really necessary that she live as she had always been used to\nliving.\n\nWhen Stanley came back her account was drawn up to the last cent of the\nproportionate amount.  In fact, it might have been a few dollars--a\nhundred or so--overdrawn.  She was not sure.  Still, that was a small\nmatter.  During the summer she would spend less, and by fall she would\nbe far ahead again--and ready to buy fall clothes.  One day he said:\n\n\"You must be needing more money.\"\n\n\"No indeed,\" cried she.  \"I've been living within the hundred a\nweek--or nearly.  I'm afraid I'm frightfully extravagant, and--\"\n\n\"Extravagant?\" laughed he.  \"You are afraid to borrow!  Why, three or\nfour nights of singing will pay back all you've borrowed.\"\n\n\"I suppose I WILL make a lot of money,\" said she. \"They all tell me so.\nBut it doesn't seem real to me.\" She hastily added:  \"I don't mean the\ncareer.  That seems real enough.  I can hardly wait to begin at the\nroles.  I mean the money part.  You see, I never earned any money and\nnever really had any money of my own.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll have plenty of it in two or three years,\" said Stanley,\nconfidently.  \"And you mustn't try to live like girls who've been\nbrought up to hardship.  It isn't necessary, and it would only unfit\nyou for your work.\"\n\n\"I think that's true,\" said she.  \"But I've enough--more than enough.\"\nShe gave him a nervous, shy, almost agonized look.  \"Please don't try\nto put me under any heavier obligations than I have to be.\"\n\n\"Please don't talk nonsense about obligation,\" retorted he.  \"Let's get\naway from this subject.  You don't seem to realize that you're doing me\na favor, that it's a privilege to be allowed to help develop such a\nmarvelous voice as yours.  Scores of people would jump at the chance.\"\n\n\"That doesn't lessen my obligation,\" said she.  And she thought she\nmeant it, though, in fact, his generous and plausible statement of the\ncase had immediately lessened not a little her sense of obligation.\n\nOn the whole, however, she was not sorry she had this chance to talk of\nobligation.  Slowly, as they saw each other from time to time, often\nalone, Stanley had begun--perhaps in spite of himself and\nunconsciously--to show his feeling for her.  Sometimes his hand\naccidentally touched hers, and he did not draw it away as quickly as he\nmight.  And she--it was impossible for her to make any gesture, much\nless say anything, that suggested sensitiveness on her part.  It would\nput him in an awkward position, would humiliate him most unjustly.  He\nfell into the habit of holding her hand longer than was necessary at\ngreeting or parting, of touching her caressingly, of looking at her\nwith the eyes of a lover instead of a friend.  She did not like these\nthings.  For some mysterious reason--from sheer perversity, she\nthought--she had taken a strong physical dislike to him.  Perfectly\nabsurd, for there was nothing intrinsically repellent about this\nhandsome, clean, most attractively dressed man, of the best type of\nAmerican and New-Yorker. No, only perversity could explain such a silly\nnotion.  She was always afraid he would try to take advantage of her\ndelicate position--always afraid she would have to yield something,\nsome trifle; yet the idea of giving anything from a sense of obligation\nwas galling to her.  His very refraining made her more nervous, the\nmore shrinking. If he would only commit some overt act--seize her, kiss\nher, make outrageous demands--but this refraining, these touches that\nmight be accidental and again might be stealthy approach--  She hated\nto have him shake hands with her, would have liked to draw away when\nhis clothing chanced to brush against hers.\n\nSo she was glad of the talk about obligation.  It set him at a\ndistance, immediately.  He ceased to look lovingly, to indulge in the\nnerve-rasping little caresses. He became carefully formal.  He was\nevidently eager to prove the sincerity of his protestations--too eager\nperhaps, her perverse mind suggested.  Still, sincere or not, he held\nto all the forms of sincerity.\n\nSome friends of Mrs. Brindley's who were going abroad offered her their\ncottage on the New Jersey coast near Seabright, and a big new\ntouring-car and chauffeur.  She and Mildred at once gave up the plan\nfor a summer in the Adirondacks, the more readily as several of the men\nand women they saw the most of lived within easy distance of them at\nDeal Beach and Elberon.  When Mildred went shopping she was lured into\nbuying a lot of summer things she would not have needed in the\nAdirondacks--a mere matter of two hundred and fifty dollars or\nthereabouts.  A little additional economy in the fall would soon make\nup for such a trifle, and if there is one time more than another when a\nwoman wishes to look well and must look well, that time is\nsummer--especially by the sea.\n\nWhen her monthly statement from the bank came on the first of July she\nfound that five thousand dollars had been deposited to her credit.  She\nwas moved by this discovery to devote several hours--very depressed\nhours they were--to her finances.  She had spent a great deal more\nmoney than she had thought; indeed, since March she had been living at\nthe rate of fifteen thousand a year.  She tried to account for this\namazing extravagance.  But she could recall no expenditure that was not\nreally almost, if not quite, necessary.  It took a frightful lot of\nmoney to live in New York. How DID people with small incomes manage to\nget along? Whatever would have become of her if she had not had the\ngood luck to be able to borrow from Stanley?  What would become of her\nif, before she was succeeding on the stage, Stanley should die or lose\nfaith in her or interest in her?  What would become of her!  She had\nbeen living these last few months among people who had wide-open eyes\nand knew everything that was going on--and did some \"going-on\"\nthemselves, as she was now more than suspecting.  There were many\nwomen, thousands of them--among the attractive, costily dressed throngs\nshe saw in the carriages and autos and cabs--who would not like to have\nit published how they contrived to live so luxuriously.  No, they would\nnot like to have it published, though they cared not a fig for its\nbeing whispered; New York too thoroughly understood how necessary\nluxurious living was, and was too completely divested of the follies of\nthe old-fashioned, straight-laced morality, to mind little shabby\ndetails of queer conduct in striving to keep up with the procession.\nEven the married women, using their husbands--and letting their\nhusbands use them--did not frown on the irregularities of their sisters\nless fortunately married or not able to find a permanent \"leg to pull.\"\nAs for the girls--Mildred had observed strange things in the lives of\nthe girls she knew more or less well nowadays.  In fact, all the women,\nof all classes and conditions, were engaged in the same mad struggle to\nget hold of money to spend upon fun and finery--a struggle matching in\nrecklessness and resoluteness the struggle of the men down-town for\nmoney for the same purposes.  It was curious, this double mania of the\nmen and the women--the mania to get money, no matter how; the instantly\nsucceeding mania to get rid of it, no matter how.  Looking about her,\nMildred felt that she was peculiar and apart from nearly all the women\nshe knew.  SHE got her money honorably. SHE did not degrade herself,\ndid not sell herself, did not wheedle or cajole or pretend in the least\ndegree.  She had grown more liberal as her outlook on life had widened\nwith contact with the New York mind--no, with the mind of the whole\neasy-going, luxury-mad, morality-scorning modern world.  She still kept\nher standard for herself high, and believed in a purity for herself\nwhich she did not exact or expect in her friends. In this respect she\nand Cyrilla Brindley were sympathetically alike.  No, Mildred was\nconfident that in no circumstances, in NO circumstances, would she\nrelax her ideas of what she personally could do and could not do. Not\nthat she blamed, or judged at all, women who did as she would not; but\nshe could not, simply could not, however hard she might be driven, do\nthose things--though she could easily understand how other women did\nthem in preference to sinking down into the working class or eking out\na frowsy existence in some poor boarding-house.  The temptation would\nbe great. Thank Heaven, it was not teasing her.  She would resist it,\nof course.  But--\n\nWhat if Stanley Baird should lose interest?  What if, after he lost\ninterest, she should find herself without money, worse of than she had\nbeen when she sold herself into slavery--highly moral and\nconventionally correct slavery, but still slavery--to the little\ngeneral with the peaked pink-silk nightcap hiding the absence of the\nremoved toupee--and with the wonderful pink-silk pajamas, gorgeously\nmonogramed in violet--and the tiny feet and ugly hands--and those\nloathsome needle-pointed mustaches and the hideous habit of mumbling\nhis tongue and smacking his lips?  What if, moneyless, she should not\nbe able to find another Stanley or a man of the class gentleman willing\nto help her generously even on ANY terms?  What then?\n\nShe was looking out over the sea, her bank-book and statements and\ncanceled checks in her lap.  Their cottage was at the very edge of the\nstrand; its veranda was often damp from spray after a storm.  It was\nnot storming as she sat there, \"taking stock\"; under a blue sky an\nalmost tranquil sea was crooning softly in the sunlight, innocent and\nhappy and playful as a child. She, dressed in a charming negligee and\nlooking forward to a merry day in the auto, with lunch and dinner at\nattractive, luxurious places farther down the coast--she was stricken\nwith a horrible sadness, with a terror that made her heart beat wildly.\n\n\"I must be crazy!\" she said, half aloud.  \"I've never earned a dollar\nwith my voice.  And for two months it has been unreliable.  I'm acting\nlike a crazy person.  What WILL become of me?\"\n\nJust then Stanley Baird came through the pretty little house, seeking\nher.  \"There you are!\" he cried.  \"Do go get dressed.\"\n\nHastily she flung a scarf over the book and papers in her lap.  She had\nintended to speak to him about that fresh deposit of five thousand\ndollars--to refuse it, to rebuke him.  Now she did not dare.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he went on.  \"Headache?\"\n\n\"It was the wine at dinner last night,\" explained she. \"I ought never\nto touch red wine.  It disagrees with me horribly.\"\n\n\"That was filthy stuff,\" said he.  \"You must take some champagne at\nlunch.  That'll set you right.\"\n\nShe stealthily wound the scarf about the papers. When she felt that all\nwere secure she rose.  She was looking sweet and sad and peculiarly\nbeautiful.  There was an exquisite sheen on her skin.  She had washed\nher hair that morning, and it was straying fascinatingly about her brow\nand ears and neck.  Baird looked at her, lowered his eyes and colored.\n\n\"I'll not be long,\" she said hurriedly.\n\nShe had to pass him in the rather narrow doorway. From her garments\nshook a delicious perfume.  He caught her in his arms.  The blood had\nflushed into his face in a torrent, swelling out the veins, giving him\na distorted and wild expression.\n\n\"Mildred!\" he cried.  \"Say that you love me a little!  I'm so lonely\nfor you--so hungry for you!\"\n\nShe grew cold with fear and with repulsion.  She neither yielded to his\nembrace nor shook it off.  She simply stood, her round smooth body hard\nthough corsetless. He kissed her on the throat, kissed the lace over\nher bosom, crying out inarticulately.  In the frenzy of his passion he\ndid not for a while realize her lack of response.  As he felt it, his\narms relaxed, dropped away from her, fell at his side.  He hung his\nhead.  He was breathing so heavily that she glanced into the house\napprehensively, fearing someone else might hear.\n\n\"I beg pardon,\" he muttered.  \"You were too much for me this morning.\nIt was your fault.  You are maddening!\"\n\nShe moved on into the house.\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" he called after her.\n\nShe halted, hesitating.\n\n\"Come back,\" he said.  \"I've got something to say to you.\"\n\nShe turned and went back to the veranda, he retreating before her and\nhis eyes sinking before the cold, clear blue of hers.\n\n\"You're going up, not to come down again,\" he said. \"You think I've\ninsulted you--think I've acted outrageously.\"\n\nHow glad she was that he had so misread her thoughts--had not\ndiscovered the fear, the weakness, the sudden collapse of all her\nboasted confidence in her strength of character.\n\n\"You'll never feel the same toward me again,\" he went fatuously on.\n\"You think I'm a fraud.  Well, I'll admit that I am in love with\nyou--have been ever since the steamer--always was crazy about that\nmouth of yours--and your figure, and the sound of your voice.  I'll\nadmit I'm an utter fool about you--respect you and trust you as I never\nused to think any woman deserved to be respected and trusted.  I'll\neven admit that I've been hoping--all sorts of things.  I knew a woman\nlike you wouldn't let a man help her unless she loved him.\"\n\nAt this her heart beat wildly and a blush of shame poured over her face\nand neck.  He did not see.  He had not the courage to look at her--to\nface that expression of the violated goddess he felt confident her face\nwas wearing.  In love, he reasoned and felt about her like an\ninexperienced boy, all his experience going for nothing.  He went on:\n\n\"I understand we can never be anything to each other until you're on\nthe stage and arrived.  I'd not have it otherwise, if I could.  For I\nwant YOU, and I'd never believe I had you unless you were free.\"\n\nThe color was fading from her cheeks.  At this it flushed deeper than\nbefore.  She must speak.  Not to speak was to lie, was to play the\nhypocrite.  Yet speak she dared not.  At least Stanley Baird was better\nthan Siddall.  Anyhow, who was she, that had been the wife of Siddall,\nto be so finicky?\n\n\"You don't believe me?\" he said miserably.  \"You think I'll forget\nmyself sometime again?\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" she said gently.  \"I believe not.  I trust you, Stanley.\"\n\nAnd she went into the house.  He looked after her, in admiration of the\nsweet and pure calm of this quiet rebuke.  She tried to take the same\nexalted view of it herself, but she could not fool herself just then\nwith the familiar \"good woman\" fake.  She knew that she had struck the\nflag of self-respect.  She knew what she would really have done had he\nbeen less delicate, less in love, and more \"practical.\"  And she found\na small and poor consolation in reflecting, \"I wonder how many women\nthere are who take high ground because it costs nothing.\"  We are prone\nto suspect everybody of any weakness we find in ourselves--and perhaps\nwe are not so far wrong as are those who accept without question the\nnoisy protestations of a world of self-deceivers.\n\nThenceforth she and Stanley got on better than ever--apparently.  But\nthough she ignored it, she knew the truth--knew her new and deep\ncontent was due to her not having challenged his assertion that she\nloved him.  He, believing her honest and high minded, assumed that the\nfailure to challenge was a good woman's way of admitting.  But with the\nday of reckoning--not only with him but also with her own\nself-respect--put off until that vague and remote time when she should\nbe a successful prima donna, she gave herself up to enjoyment.  That\nwas a summer of rarely fine weather, particularly fine along the Jersey\ncoast.  They--always in gay parties--motored up and down the coast and\ninland.  Several of the \"musical\" men--notably Richardson of\nElberon--had plenty of money; Stanley, stopping with his cousins, the\nFrasers, on the Rumson Road, brought several of his friends, all rich\nand more or less free.  As every moment of Mildred's day was full and\nas it was impossible not to sleep and sleep well in that ocean air,\nwith the surf soothing the nerves as the lullaby of a nurse soothes a\nbaby, she was able to put everything unpleasant out of mind.  She was\nresting her voice, was building up her health; therefore the career was\nbeing steadily advanced and no time was being wasted.  She felt sorry\nfor those who had to do unpleasant or disagreeable things in making\ntheir careers.  She told herself that she did not deserve her good\nfortune in being able to advance to a brilliant career not through\nhardship but over the most delightful road imaginable--amusing herself,\nwearing charming and satisfactory clothes, swimming and dancing,\nmotoring and feasting.  Without realizing it, she was strongly under\nthe delusion that she was herself already rich--the inevitable delusion\nwith a woman when she moves easily and freely and luxuriously about,\nnever bothered for money, always in the company of rich people.  The\nrich are fated to demoralize those around them.  The stingy rich fill\ntheir satellites with envy and hatred.  The generous rich fill them\nwith the feeling that the light by which they shine and the heat with\nwhich they are warm are not reflected light and heat but their own.\n\nNever had she been so happy.  She even did not especially mind Donald\nKeith, a friend of Stanley's and of Mrs. Brindley's, who, much too\noften to suit her, made one of the party.  She had tried in vain to\ndiscover what there was in Keith that inspired such intense liking in\ntwo people so widely different as expansive and emotional Stanley Baird\nand reserved and distinctly cold Cyrilla Brindley.  Keith talked\nlittle, not only seemed not to listen well, but showed plainly, even in\ntete-a-tete conversations, that his thoughts had been elsewhere. He\nmade no pretense of being other than he was--an indifferent man who\ncame because it did not especially matter to him where he was.\nSometimes his silence and his indifference annoyed Mildred;\nagain--thanks to her profound and reckless contentment--she was able to\nforget that he was along.  He seemed to be and probably was about forty\nyears old.  His head was beautifully shaped, the line of its\nprofile--front, top, and back--being perfect in intellectuality,\nstrength and symmetry.  He was rather under the medium height, about\nthe same height as Mildred herself.  He was extremely thin and loosely\nbuilt, and his clothes seemed to hang awry, giving him an air of\nslovenliness which became surprising when one noted how scrupulously\nneat and clean he was.  His brown hair, considerably tinged with rusty\ngray, grew thinly upon that beautiful head.  His skin was dry and\nsmooth and dead white. This, taken with the classic regularity of his\nfeatures, gave him an air of lifelessness, of one burnt out by the fire\nof too much living; but whether the living had been done by Keith\nhimself or by his immediate ancestors appearances did not disclose.\nThis look of passionless, motionless repose, like classic sculpture,\nwas sharply and startlingly belied by a pair of really wonderful\neyes--deeply and intensely blue, brilliant, all seeing, all\ncomprehending, eyes that seemed never to sleep, seemed the ceaselessly\nindustrious servants of a brain that busied itself without pause.  The\ncontrast between the dead white calm of his face, the listlessness of\nhis relaxed figure, and these vivid eyes, so intensely alive, gave to\nDonald Keith's personality an uncanniness that was most disagreeable to\nMildred.\n\n\"That's what fascinates me,\" said Cyrilla, when they were discussing\nhim one day.\n\n\"Fascinates!\" exclaimed Mildred.  \"He's tiresome--when he isn't rude.\"\n\n\"Rude?\"\n\n\"Not actively rude but, worse still, passively rude.\"\n\n\"He is the only man I've ever seen with whom I could imagine myself\nfalling in love,\" said Mrs. Brindley.\n\nMildred laughed in derision.  \"Why, he's a dead man!\" cried she.\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said Cyrilla.  \"You've never lived with a man.\"\nShe forgot completely, as did Mildred herself, so completely had Mrs.\nSiddall returned to the modes and thoughts of a girl.  \"At home--to\nlive with--you want only reposeful things.  That is why the Greeks,\nwhose instincts were unerring, had so much reposeful statuary.  One\ngrows weary of agitating objects.  They soon seem hysterical and\nshallow. The same thing's true of persons.  For permanent love and\nfriendship you want reposeful men--calm, strong, silent.  The other\nkind either wear you out or wear themselves out with you.\"\n\n\"You forget his eyes,\" put in Stanley.  \"Did you ever see such eyes!\"\n\n\"Yes, those eyes of his!\" cried Mildred.  \"You certainly can't call\nthem reposeful, Mrs. Brindley.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley did not seize the opportunity to convict her of\ninconsistency.  Said she:\n\n\"I admit the eyes.  They're the eyes of the kind of man a woman wants,\nor another man wants in his friend. When Keith looks at you, you feel\nthat you are seeing the rarest being in the world--an absolutely\nreliable person.  When I think of him I think of reliable, just as when\nyou think of the sun you think of brightness.\"\n\n\"I had no idea it was so serious as this,\" teased Stanley.\n\n\"Nor had I,\" returned Cyrilla easily, \"until I began to talk about him.\nDon't tell him, Mr. Baird, or he might take advantage of me.\"\n\nThe idea amused Stanley.  \"He doesn't care a rap about women,\" said he.\n\"I hear he has let a few care about him from time to time, but he soon\nceased to be good-natured.  He hates to be bored.\"\n\nAs he came just then, they had to find another subject.  Mildred\nobserved him with more interest.  She had learned to have respect for\nMrs. Brindley's judgments.  But she soon gave over watching him.  That\nprofound calm, those eyes concentrating all the life of the man like a\nburning glass--  She had a disagreeable sense of being seen through,\neven to her secretest thought, of being understood and measured and\nweighed--and found wanting.  It occurred to her for the first time that\npart of the reason for her not liking him was the best of reasons--that\nhe did not like her.\n\nThe first time she was left alone with him, after this discovery, she\nhappened to be in an audacious and talkative mood, and his lack of\nresponse finally goaded her into saying:  \"WHY don't you like me?\"  She\ncared nothing about it; she simply wished to hear what he would say--if\nhe could be roused into saying anything. He was sitting on the steps\nleading from the veranda to the sea--was smoking a cigarette and gazing\nout over the waves like a graven image, as if he had always been posed\nthere and always would be there, the embodiment of repose gazing in\nineffable indifference upon the embodiment of its opposite.  He made no\nanswer.\n\n\"I asked you why you do not like me,\" said she. \"Did you hear?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he.\n\nShe waited; nothing further from him.  Said she:\n\n\"Well, give me one of your cigarettes.\"\n\nHe rose, extended his case, then a light.  He was never remiss in those\nkinds of politeness.  When she was smoking, he seated himself again and\ndropped into the former attitude.  She eyed him, wondering how it could\nbe possible that he had endured the incredible fatigues and hardships\nStanley Baird had related of him--hunting and exploring expeditions\ninto tropics and into frozen regions, mountain climbs, wild sea voyages\nin small boats, all with no sign of being able to stand anything, yet\nalso with no sign of being any more disturbed than now in this seaside\nlaziness.  Stanley had showed them a picture of him taken twenty years\nand more ago when he was in college; he had looked almost the same\nthen--perhaps a little older.\n\n\"Well, I am waiting,\" persisted she.\n\nShe thought he was about to look at her--a thing he had never done, to\nher knowledge, since they had known each other.  She nerved herself to\nreceive the shock, with a certain flutter of expectancy, of excitement\neven.  But instead of looking, he settled himself in a slightly\ndifferent position and fixed his gaze upon another point in the\nhorizon.  She noted that he had splendid hands--ideal hands for a man,\nwith the same suggestion of intense vitality and aliveness that flashed\nfrom his eyes.  She had not noted this before.  Next she saw that he\nhad good feet, and that his boots were his only article of apparel that\nfitted him, or rather, that looked as if made for him.\n\nShe tossed her cigarette over the rail to the sand. He startled her by\nspeaking, in his unemotional way. He said:\n\n\"Now, I like you better.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said she.\n\nNo answer from him.  The cigarette depending listlessly from his lips\nseemed--as usual--uncertain whether it would stay or fall.  She watched\nthis uncertainty with a curious, nervous interest.  She was always\nthinking that cigarette would fall, but it never did. Said she:\n\n\"Why did you say you liked me less?\"\n\n\"Better,\" corrected he.\n\n\"We used to have a pump in our back yard at home,\" laughed she.  \"One\ntoiled away at the handle, but nothing ever came.  And it was a\npromising-looking pump, too.\"\n\nHe smiled--a slow, reluctant smile, but undeniably attractive.  Said he:\n\n\"Because you threw away your cigarette.\"\n\n\"You object to women smoking?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he.  His tone made her feel how absurd it was to suspect him\nof such provincialism.\n\n\"You object to MY smoking?\" suggested she; laughing, \"Pump!  Pump!\"\n\n\"No,\" said he.\n\n\"Then your remark meant nothing at all?\"\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\"You are rude,\" said she coldly, rising to go into the house.\n\nHe said something, what she did not hear, in her agitation.  She paused\nand inquired:\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I said, I am not rude but kind,\" replied he.\n\n\"That is detestable!\" cried she.  \"I have not liked you, but I have\nbeen polite to you because of Stanley and Mrs. Brindley.  Why should\nyou be insulting to me?\"\n\n\"What have I done?\" inquired he, unmoved.  He had risen as she rose,\nbut instead of facing her he was leaning against the post of the\nveranda, bent upon his seaward vigil.\n\n\"You have insinuated that your reasons for not liking me were a\nreflection on me.\"\n\n\"You insisted,\" said he.\n\n\"You mean that they are?\" demanded she furiously. She was amazed at her\nwild, unaccountable rage.\n\nHe slowly turned his head and looked at her--a glance without any\nemotion whatever, simply a look that, like the beam of a powerful\nsearchlight, seemed to thrust through fog and darkness and to light up\neverything in its path.  Said he:\n\n\"Do you wish me to tell you why I don't like you?\"\n\n\"No!\" she cried hysterically.  \"Never mind--I don't know what I'm\nsaying.\"  And she went hastily into the house.  A moment later, in her\nown room upstairs, she was wondering at herself.  Why had she become\nconfused?  What did he mean?  What had she seen--or half seen--in the\ndarkness and fog within herself when he looked at her?  In a passion\nshe cried:\n\n\"If he would only stay away!\"\n\n\n\nVI\n\nBUT he did not stay away.  He owned and lived in a small house up on\nthe Rumson Road.  While the house was little more than a bungalow and\nhad a simplicity that completely hid its rare good taste from the\naverage observer, its grounds were the most spacious in that\nneighborhood of costly, showy houses set in grounds not much more\nextensive than a city building lot.  The grounds had been cleared and\ndrained to drive out and to keep out the obnoxious insect life, but had\nbeen left a forest, concealing the house from the roads.  Stanley Baird\nwas now stopping with Keith, and brought him along to the cottage by\nthe sea every day.\n\nThe parties narrowed to the same four persons.  Mrs. Brindley seemed\nnever to tire of talking to Keith--or to tire of talking about him when\nthe two men had left, late each night.  As for Stanley, he referred\neverything to Keith--the weather prospects, where they should go for\nthe day, what should be eaten and drunk, any point about politics or\nfashion, life or literature or what not, that happened to be discussed.\nAnd he looked upon Donald's monosyllabic reply to his inquiry as a\nfinal judgment, ending all possibility of argument. Mildred held out\nlong.  Then, in spite of herself, she began to yield, ceased to dislike\nhim, found a kind of pleasure--or, perhaps, fascinated interest--in the\nnervousness his silent and indifferent presence caused her.  She liked\nto watch that immobile, perfect profile, neither young nor old, indeed\nnot suggesting age in any degree, but only experience and\nknowledge--and an infinite capacity for emotion, for passion even.  The\ndead-white color declared it had already been lived; the brilliant,\nusually averted or veiled eyes asserted present vitality, pulsing under\na calm surface.\n\nOne day when Stanley, in the manner of one who wishes a thing settled\nand settled right, said he would ask Donald Keith about it, Mildred, a\nlittle piqued, a little amused, retorted:\n\n\"And what will he answer?  Why, simply yes or no.\"\n\n\"That's all,\" assented Stanley.  \"And that's quite enough, isn't it?\"\n\n\"But how do you know he's as wise as he pretends?\"\n\n\"He doesn't pretend to be anything or to know anything.  That's\nprecisely it.\"\n\nMildred suddenly began to like Keith.  She had never thought of this\nbefore.  Yes, it was true, he did not pretend.  Not in the least, not\nabout anything.  When you saw him, you saw at once the worst there was\nto see.  It was afterward that you discovered he was not slovenly, but\nclean and neat, not badly but well dressed, not homely but handsome,\nnot sickly but soundly well, not physically weak but strong, not dull\nbut vividly alive, not a tiresome void but an unfathomable mystery.\n\n\"What does he do?\" she asked Mrs. Brindley.\n\nCyrilla's usually positive gray eyes looked vague. She smiled.  \"I\nnever asked,\" said she.  \"I've known him nearly three years, and it\nnever occurred to me to ask, or to wonder.  Isn't that strange? Usually\nabout the first inquiry we make is what a man does.\"\n\n\"I'll ask Stanley,\" said Mildred.  And she did about an hour later,\nwhen they were in the surf together, with the other two out of earshot.\nSaid Stanley:\n\n\"He's a lawyer, of course.  Also, he's written a novel or two and a\nbook of poems.  I've never read them. Somehow, I never get around to\nreading.\"\n\n\"Oh, he's a lawyer?  That's the way he makes his living.\"\n\n\"A queer kind of lawyer.  He never goes to court, and his clients are\nalmost all other lawyers.  They go to him to get him to tell them what\nto do, and what not to do.  He's got a big reputation among lawyers,\nFred Norman tells me, but makes comparatively little, as he either\ncan't or won't charge what he ought.  I told him what Norman said, and\nhe only smiled in that queer way he has.  I said:  'You make twenty or\nthirty thousand a year.  You ought to make ten times that.'\"\n\n\"And what did he answer?\" asked Mildred.  \"Nothing?\"\n\n\"He said:  'I make all I want.  If I took in more, I'd be bothered\ngetting rid of it or investing it.  I can always make all I'll\nwant--unless I go crazy.  And what could a crazy man do with money?  It\ndoesn't cost anything to live in a lunatic asylum.'\"\n\nSeveral items of interest to add to those she had collected.  He could\ntalk brilliantly, but he preferred silence.  He could make himself\nattractive to women and to men, but he preferred to be detached.  He\ncould be a great lawyer, but he preferred the quiet of obscurity. He\ncould be a rich man, but he preferred to be comparatively poor.\n\nSaid Mildred:  \"I suppose some woman--some disappointment in love--has\nkilled ambition, and everything like that.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" replied Baird.  \"The men who knew him as a boy say\nhe was always as he is now.  He lived in the Arabian desert for two\nyears.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he stay?\" laughed Mildred.  \"That life would exactly suit\nhim.\"\n\n\"It did,\" said Stanley.  \"But his father died, and he had to come home\nand support his mother--until she died.  That's the way his whole life\nhas been. He drifts in the current of circumstances.  He might let\nhimself be blown away to-morrow to the other end of the earth and stay\naway years--or never come back.\"\n\n\"But how would he live?\"\n\n\"On his wits.  And as well or as poorly as he cared. He's the sort of\nman everyone instinctively asks advice of--me, you, his valet, the\nfarmer who meets him at a boundary fence, the fellow who sits nest him\nin a train--anyone.\"\n\nMildred did not merely cease to dislike him; she went farther, and\nrapidly.  She began to like him, to circle round that tantalizing,\nindolent mystery as a deer about a queer bit of brush in the\nundergrowth.  She liked to watch him.  She was alternately afraid to\ntalk before him and recklessly confidential--all with no response or\nsign of interest from him.  If she was silent, when they were alone\ntogether, he was silent, too.  If she talked, still he was silent. What\nWAS he thinking about? What did he think of her?--that especially.\n\n\"What ARE you thinking?\" she interrupted herself to say one afternoon\nas they sat together on the strand under a big sunshade.  She had been\ntalking on and on about her career--talking conceitedly, as her subject\nintoxicated her--telling him what triumphs awaited her as soon as she\nshould be ready to debut.  As he did not answer, she repeated her\nquestion, adding:\n\n\"I knew you weren't listening to me, or I shouldn't have had the\ncourage to say the foolish things I did.\"\n\n\"No, I wasn't,\" admitted he.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"For the reason you gave.\"\n\n\"That what I said was--just talk?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You don't believe I'll do those things?\"\n\n\"Do you?\"\n\n\"I've GOT to believe it,\" said she.  \"If I didn't--\" She came to a full\nstop.\n\n\"If you didn't, then what?\"  It was the first time he had ever\nflattered her with interest enough to ask her a question about herself.\n\n\"If I didn't believe I was going to succeed--and succeed big--\" she\nbegan.  After a pause, she added, \"I'd not dare say it.\"\n\n\"Or think it,\" said he.\n\nShe colored.  \"What do you mean?\" she asked.\n\nHe did not reply.\n\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Keith?\" she urged.\n\n\"You are always asking me questions to which you already know the\nanswer,\" said he.\n\n\"You're referring to a week or so ago, when I asked you why you\ndisliked me?\"\n\nNo answer.  No sign of having heard.  No outward sign of interest in\nanything, even in the cigarette drooping from the corner of his mouth.\n\n\"Wasn't that it?\" she insisted.\n\n\"You are always asking me questions to which you already know the\nanswer,\" repeated he.\n\n\"I am annoying you?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\nShe laughed.  \"Do you want me to go away and leave you in peace with\nthat--law case--or whatever it is?\"\n\n\"I don't like to be alone.\"\n\n\"But anyone would do?--a dog?\"\n\nNo reply.\n\n\"You mean, a dog would be better because it doesn't ask questions to\nwhich it knows the answer.\"\n\nNo reply.\n\n\"Well, I have a pleasant-sounding voice.  As I'm saying nothing, it may\nbe soothing--like the sound of the waves.  I've learned to take you as\nyou are.  I rather like your pose.\"\n\nNo reply.  No sign that he was even tempted to rise to this bait and\nprotest.\n\n\"But you don't like mine,\" she went on.  \"Yes, it is a pose.  But I've\ngot to keep it up, and to pretend to myself that it isn't.  And it\nisn't altogether.  I shall be a successful singer.\"\n\n\"When?\" said he.  Actually he was listening!\n\nShe answered:  \"In--about two years, I think.\"\n\nNo comment.\n\n\"You don't believe it?\"\n\n\"Do you?\"  A pause.  \"Why ask these questions you've already answered\nyourself?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you why,\" replied she, her face suddenly flushed with\nearnestness.  \"Because I want you to help me.  You help everyone else.\nWhy not me?\"\n\n\"You never asked me,\" said he.\n\n\"I didn't know I wanted it until just now--as I said it.  But YOU must\nhave known, because you are so much more experienced than I--and\nunderstand people--what's going on in their minds, deeper than they can\nsee.\"  Her tone became indignant, reproachful. \"Yes, you must have\nknown I needed your help. And you ought to have helped me, even if you\ndid dislike me.  You've no right to dislike anyone as young as I.\"\n\nHe was looking at her now, the intensely alive blue eyes sympathetic,\npenetrating, understanding.  It was frightful to be so thoroughly\nunderstood--all one's weaknesses laid bare--yet it was a relief and a\njoy, too--like the cruel healing knife of the surgeon.  Said he:\n\n\"I do not like kept women.\"\n\nShe gasped, grew ghastly.  It was a frightful insult, one for which she\nwas wholly unprepared.  \"You--believe--that?\" she said slowly.\n\n\"Another of those questions,\" he said.  And he looked calmly away, out\nover the sea, as if his interest in the conversation were at an end.\n\nWhat should she say?  How deny--how convince him?  For convince him she\nmust, and then go away and never permit him to speak to her again until\nhe had apologized.  She said quietly:  \"Mr. Keith, you have insulted\nme.\"\n\n\"I do not like kept women, either with or without a license,\" said he\nin the same even, indifferent way. \"When you ceased to be a kept woman,\nI would help you, if I could.  But no one can help a kept woman.\"\n\nThere was nothing to do but to rise and go away. She rose and went\ntoward the house.  At the veranda she paused.  He had not moved.  She\nreturned.  He was still inspecting the horizon, the cigarette depending\nfrom his lips--how DID he keep it alight?  She said:\n\n\"Mr. Keith, I am sure you did not mean to insult me. What did you mean?\"\n\n\"Another of those questions,\" said he.\n\n\"Honestly, I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Then think.  And when you have thought, you will understand.\"\n\n\"But I have thought.  I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Then it would be useless to explain,\" said he. \"That is one of those\nvital things which, if one cannot understand them for oneself, one is\nhopeless--is beyond helping.\"\n\n\"You mean I am not in earnest about my career?\"\n\n\"Another of those questions.  If you had not seen clearly what I meant,\nyou would have been really offended.  You'd have gone away and not come\nback.\"\n\nShe saw that this was true.  And, seeing, she wondered how she could\nhave been so stupid as not to have seen it at once.  She had yet to\nlearn that overlooking the obvious is a universal human failing and\nthat seeing the obvious is the talent and the use of the superior of\nearth--the few who dominate and determine the race.\n\n\"You reproach me for not having helped you,\" he went on.  \"How does it\nhappen that you are uneasy in mind--so uneasy that you are quarreling\nat me?\"\n\nA light broke upon her.  \"You have been drawing me on, from the\nbeginning,\" she cried.  \"You have been helping me--making me see that I\nneeded help.\"\n\n\"No,\" said he.  \"I've been waiting to see whether you would rouse from\nyour dream of grandeur.\"\n\n\"YOU have been rousing me.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said.  \"You've roused yourself.  So you may be worth helping\nor, rather, worth encouraging, for no one can HELP you but yourself.\"\n\nShe looked at him pathetically.  \"But what shall I do?\" she asked.\n\"I've got no money, no experience, no sense.  I'm a vain, luxury-loving\nfool, cursed with a--with a--is it a conscience?\"\n\n\"I hope it's something more substantial.  I hope it's common sense.\"\n\n\"But I have been working--honestly I have.\"\n\n\"Don't begin lying to yourself again.\"\n\n\"Don't be harsh with me.\"\n\nHe drew in his legs, in preparation for rising--no doubt to go away.\n\n\"I don't mean that,\" she cried testily.  \"You are not harsh with me.\nIt's the truth that's harsh--the truth I'm beginning to see--and feel.\nI am afraid--afraid.  I haven't the courage to face it.\"\n\n\"Why whine?\" said he.  \"There's nothing in that.\"\n\n\"Do you think there's any hope for me?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" said he.\n\n\"On what?\"\n\n\"On what you want.\"\n\n\"I want to be a singer, a great singer.\"\n\n\"No, there's no hope.\"\n\nShe grew cold with despair.  He had a way of saying a thing that gave\nit the full weight of a verdict from which there was no appeal.\n\n\"Now, if you wanted to make a living,\" he went on, \"and if you were\ndetermined to learn to sing as well as you could, with the idea that\nyou might be able to make a living--why, then there might be hope.\"\n\n\"You think I can sing?\"\n\n\"I never heard you.  Can you?\"\n\n\"They say I can.\"\n\n\"What do YOU say?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she confessed.  \"I've never been able to judge.\nSometimes I think I'm singing well, and I find out afterward that I've\nsung badly.  Again, it's the other way.\"\n\n\"Then, obviously, what's the first thing to do?\"\n\n\"To learn to judge myself,\" said she.  \"I never thought of it\nbefore--how important that is.  Do you know Jennings--Eugene Jennings?\"\n\n\"The singing teacher?  No.\"\n\n\"Is he a good teacher?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because he has not taught you that you will never sing until you are\nyour own teacher.  Because he has not taught you that singing is a\nsmall and minor part of a career as a singer.\"\n\n\"But it isn't,\" protested she.\n\nA long silence.  Looking at him, she felt that he had dismissed her and\nher affairs from his mind.\n\n\"Is it?\" she said, to bring him back.\n\n\"What?\" asked he vaguely.\n\n\"You said that a singer didn't have to be able to sing.\"\n\n\"Did I?\"  He glanced down the shore toward the house.  \"It feels like\nlunch-time.\"  He rose.\n\n\"What did you mean by what you said?\"\n\n\"When you have thought about your case a while longer, we'll talk of it\nagain--if you wish.  But until you've thought, talking is a waste of\ntime.\"\n\nShe rose, stood staring out to sea.  He was observing her, a faint\nsmile about his lips.  He said:\n\n\"Why bother about a career?  After all, kept woman is a thoroughly\nrespectable occupation--or can be made so by any preacher or justice of\nthe peace. It's followed by many of our best women--those who pride\nthemselves on their high characters--and on their pride.\"\n\n\"I could not belong to a man unless I cared for him,\" said she.  \"I\ntried it once.  I shall never do it again.\"\n\n\"That sounds fine,\" said he.  \"Let's go to lunch.\"\n\n\"You don't believe me?\"\n\n\"Do you?\"\n\nShe sank down upon the sand and burst into a wild passion of sobs and\ntears.  When her fight for self-control was over and she looked up to\napologize for her pitiful exhibition of weakness--and to note whether\nshe had made an impression upon his sympathies--she saw him just\nentering the house, a quarter of a mile away.  To anger succeeded a\nmood of desperate forlornness.  She fell upon herself with gloomy\nferocity. She could not sing.  She had no brains.  She was taking\nmoney--a disgracefully large amount of money--from Stanley Baird under\nfalse pretenses.  How could she hope to sing when her voice could not\nbe relied upon? Was not her throat at that very moment slightly sore?\nWas it not always going queer?  She--sing!  Absurd. Did Stanley Baird\nsuspect?  Was he waiting for the time when she would gladly accept what\nshe must have from him, on his own terms?  No, not on his terms, but on\nthe terms she herself would arrange--the only terms she could make. No,\nStanley believed in her absolutely--believed in her career.  When he\ndiscovered the truth, he would lose interest in her, would regard her\nas a poor, worthless creature, would be eager to rid himself of her.\nInstead of returning to the house, she went in the opposite direction,\nmade a circuit and buried herself in the woods beyond the Shrewsbury.\nShe was mad to get away from her own company; but the only company she\ncould fly to was more depressing than the solitude and the taunt and\nsneer and lash of her own thoughts.  It was late in the afternoon\nbefore she nerved herself to go home.  She hoped the others would have\ngone off somewhere; but they were waiting for her, Stanley anxious and\nCyrilla Brindley irritated.  Her eyes sought Keith.  He was, as usual,\nthe indifferent spectator.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" cried Stanley.\n\n\"Making up my mind,\" said she in the tone that forewarns of a storm.\n\nA brief pause.  She struggled in vain against an impulse to look at\nKeith.  When her eyes turned in his direction he, not looking at her,\nmoved in his listless way toward the door.  Said he:\n\n\"The auto's waiting.  Come on.\"\n\nShe vacillated, yielded, began to put on the wraps Stanley was\ncollecting for her.  It was a big touring-car, and they sat two and\ntwo, with the chauffeur alone. Keith was beside Mildred.  When they\nwere under way, she said:\n\n\"Why did you stop me?  Perhaps I'll never have the courage again.\"\n\n\"Courage for what?\" asked he.\n\n\"To take your advice, and break off.\"\n\n\"MY advice?\"\n\n\"Yes, your advice.\"\n\n\"You have to clutch at and cling to somebody, don't you?  You can't\nbear the idea of standing up by your own strength.\"\n\n\"You think I'm trying to fasten to you?\" she said, with an angry laugh.\n\n\"I know it.  You admitted it.  You are not satisfied with the way\nthings are going.  You have doubts about your career.  You shrink from\nyour only comfortable alternative, if the career winks out.  You ask me\nmy opinion about yourself and about careers.  I give it. Now, I find\nyou asked only that you might have someone to lean on, to accuse of\nhaving got you into a mess, if doing what you think you ought to do\nturns out as badly as you fear.\"\n\nIt was the longest speech she had heard him make. She had no\ninclination to dispute his analysis of her motives.  \"I did not realize\nit,\" said she, \"but that is probably so.  But--remember how I was\nbrought up.\"\n\n\"There's only one thing for you to do.\"\n\n\"Go back to my husband?  You know--about me--don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"I can't go back to him.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then--what?\" she asked.\n\n\"Go on, as now,\" replied he.\n\n\"You despise me, don't you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But you said you did.\"\n\n\"Dislike and despise are not at all the same.\"\n\n\"You admit that you dislike me,\" cried she triumphantly. He did not\nanswer.\n\n\"You think me a weak, clinging creature, not able to do anything but\nmake pretenses.\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Don't you?\" she persisted.\n\n\"Probably I have about the same opinion of you that you have of\nyourself.\"\n\n\"What WILL become of me?\" she said.  Her face lighted up with an\nexpression of reckless beauty.  \"If I could only get started I'd go to\nthe devil, laughing and dancing--and taking a train with me.\"\n\n\"You ARE started,\" said he, with an amiable smile. \"Keep on.  But I\ndoubt if you'll be so well amused as you may imagine.  Going to the\ndevil isn't as it's painted in novels by homely old maids and by men\ntoo timid to go out of nights.  A few steps farther, and your\ndisillusionment will begin.  But there'll be no turning back.  Already,\nyou are almost too old to make a career.\"\n\n\"I'm only twenty-four.  I flattered myself I looked still younger.\"\n\n\"It's worse than I thought,\" said he.  \"Most of the singers, even the\nsecond-rate ones, began at fifteen--began seriously.  And you haven't\nbegun yet.\"\n\n\"That's unjust,\" she protested.  \"I've done a little. Many great people\nwould think it a great deal.\"\n\n\"You haven't begun yet,\" repeated he calmly.  \"You have spent a lot of\nmoney, and have done a lot of dreaming and talking and listening to\ncompliments, and have taken a lot of lessons of an expensive charlatan.\nBut what have those things to do with a career?\"\n\n\"You've never heard me sing.\"\n\n\"I do not care for singing.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said she in a tone of relief.  \"Then you know nothing about all\nthis.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I know everything about a career. And we were talking\nof careers, not of singing.\"\n\n\"You mean that my voice is worthless because I haven't the other\nelements?\"\n\n\"What else could I have meant?\" said he.  \"You haven't the strength.\nYou haven't the health.\"\n\nShe laughed as she straightened herself.  \"Do I look weak and sickly?\"\ncried she.\n\n\"For the purposes of a career as a female you are strong and well,\"\nsaid he.  \"For the purpose of a career as a singer--\"  He smiled and\nshook his head. \"A singer must have muscles like wire ropes, like a\nblacksmith or a washerwoman.  The other day we were climbing a hill--a\nnot very steep hill.  You stopped five times for breath, and twice you\nsat down to rest.\"\n\nShe was literally hanging her head with shame.  \"I wasn't very well\nthat day,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Don't deceive yourself,\" said he.  \"Don't indulge in the fatal folly\nof self-excuse.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" she said humbly.  \"I want to hear it all.\"\n\n\"Is your throat sore to-day?\" pursued he.\n\nShe colored.  \"It's better,\" she murmured.\n\n\"A singer with sore throat!\" mocked he.  \"You've had a slight fogginess\nof the voice all summer.\"\n\n\"It's this sea air,\" she eagerly protested.  \"It affects everyone.\"\n\n\"No self-excuse, please,\" interrupted he.  \"Cigarettes, champagne, all\nkinds of foolish food, an impaired digestion--that's the truth, and you\nknow it.\"\n\n\"I've got splendid digestion!  I can eat anything!\" she cried.  \"Oh,\nyou don't know the first thing about singing.  You don't know about\ntemperament, about art, about all the things that singing really means.\"\n\n\"We were talking of careers,\" said he.  \"A career means a person who\ncan be relied upon to do what is demanded of him.  A singer's career\nmeans a powerful body, perfect health, a sound digestion.  Without\nthem, the voice will not be reliable.  What you need is not singing\nteachers, but teachers of athletics and of hygiene. To hear you talk\nabout a career is like listening to a child.  You think you can become\na professional singer by paying money to a teacher.  There are lawyers\nand doctors and business men in all lines who think that way about\ntheir professions--that learning a little routine of technical\nknowledge makes a lawyer or a doctor or a merchant or a financier.\"\n\n\"Tell me--WHAT ought I to learn?\"\n\n\"Learn to think--and to persist.  Learn to concentrate.  Learn to make\nsacrifices.  Learn to handle yourself as a great painter handles his\nbrush and colors. Then perhaps you'll make a career as a singer.  If\nnot, it'll be a career as something or other.\"\n\nShe was watching him with a wistful, puzzled expression. \"Could I ever\ndo all that?\"\n\n\"Anyone could, by working away at it every day. If you gain only one\ninch a day, in a year you'll have gained three hundred and sixty-five\ninches.  And if you gain an inch a day for a while and hold it, you\nsoon begin to gain a foot a day.  But there's no need to worry about\nthat.\"  He was gazing at her now with an expression of animation that\nshowed how feverishly alive he was behind that mask of calmness.  \"The\nday's work--that's the story of success.  Do the day's work\npersistently, thoroughly, intelligently.  Never mind about to-morrow.\nThinking of it means dreaming or despairing--both futilities.  Just the\nday's work.\"\n\n\"I begin to understand,\" she said thoughtfully. \"You are right.  I've\ndone nothing.  Oh, I've been a fool--more foolish even than I thought.\"\n\nA long silence, then she said, somewhat embarrassed and in a low voice,\nthough there was no danger of those in front of them hearing:\n\n\"I want you to know that there has been nothing wrong--between Stanley\nand me.\"\n\n\"Do you wish me to put that to your credit or to your discredit?\"\ninquired he.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, you've just told me that you haven't given Stanley anything at\nall for his money--that you've cheated him outright.  The thing itself\nis discreditable, but your tone suggests that you think I'll admire you\nfor it.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that you'd think more highly of me if I were--what\nmost women would be in the same circumstances?\"\n\n\"I mean to say that I think the whole business is discreditable to both\nof you--to his intelligence, to your character.\"\n\n\"You are frank,\" said she, trying to hide her anger.\n\n\"I am frank,\" replied he, undisturbed.  He looked at her.  \"Why should\nI not be?\"\n\n\"You know that I need you, that I don't dare resent,\" said she.  \"So\nisn't it--a little cowardly?\"\n\n\"Why do you need me?  Not for money, for you know you'll not get that.\"\n\n\"I don't want it,\" cried she, agitated.  \"I never thought of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, you've probably thought of it,\" replied he coolly.  \"But you will\nnot get it.\"\n\n\"Well, that's settled--I'll not get it.\"\n\n\"Then why do you need me?  Of what use can I be to you?  Only one use\nin the world.  To tell you the truth--the exact truth.  Is not that so?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.  \"That is what I want from you--what I can't get from\nanyone else.  No one else knows the truth--not even Mrs. Brindley,\nthough she's intelligent.  I take back what I said about your being\ncowardly.  Oh, you do stab my vanity so!  You mustn't mind my crying\nout.  I can't help it--at least, not till I get used to you.\"\n\n\"Cry out,\" said he.  \"It does no harm.\"\n\n\"How wonderfully you understand me!\" exclaimed she.  \"That's why I let\nyou say to me anything you please.\"\n\nHe was smiling peculiarly--a smile that somehow made her feel\nuncomfortable.  She nerved herself for some still deeper stab into her\nvanity.  He said, his gaze upon her and ironical:\n\n\"I'm sorry I can't return the compliment.\"\n\n\"What compliment?\" asked she.\n\n\"Can't say that you understand me.  Why do you think I am doing this?\"\n\nShe colored.  \"Oh, no indeed, Mr. Keith,\" she protested, \"I don't think\nyou are in love with me--or anything of that sort.  Indeed, I do not. I\nknow you better than that.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said he, amused.  \"Then you are not human.\"\n\n\"How can you think me so vain?\" she protested.\n\n\"Because you are so,\" replied he.  \"You are as vain--no more so, but\njust as much so--as the average pretty and attractive woman brought up\nas you have been.  You are not obsessed by the notion that your\nphysical charms are all-powerful, and in that fact there is hope for\nyou.  But you attach entirely too much importance to them.  You will\nfind them a hindrance for a long time before they begin to be a help to\nyou in your career.  And they will always be a temptation to you to\ntake the easy, stupid way of making a living--the only way open to most\nwomen that is not positively repulsive.\"\n\n\"I think it is the most repulsive,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Don't cant,\" replied he, unimpressed.  \"It's not so repulsive to your\nsort of woman as manual labor--or as any kind of work that means no\nleisure, no luxury and small pay.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Mildred.  \"I--I'm afraid you're right.  But I WON'T\nadmit it.  I don't dare.\"\n\n\"That's the finest, truest thing I've ever heard you say,\" said Keith.\n\nMildred was pleased out of all proportion to the compliment.  Said she\nwith frank eagerness, \"Then I'm not altogether hopeless?\"\n\n\"As a character, no indeed,\" replied he.  \"But as a career--  I was\nabout to say, you may set your mind at rest.  I shall never try to\ncollect for my services. I am doing all this solely out of obstinacy.\"\n\n\"Obstinacy?\" asked the puzzled girl.\n\n\"The impossible attracts me.  That's why I've never been interested to\nmake a career in law or politics or those things.  I care only for the\nthing that can't be done.  When I saw you and studied you, as I study\nevery new thing, I decided that you could not possibly make a career.\"\n\n\"Why have you changed your mind?\" she interrupted eagerly.\n\n\"I haven't,\" replied he.  \"If I had, I should have lost interest in\nyou.  Just as soon as you show signs of making a career, I shall lose\ninterest in you.  I have a friend, a doctor, who will take only cases\nwhere cure is impossible.  Looking at you, it occurred to me that here\nwas a chance to make an experiment more interesting than any of his.\nAnd as I have no other impossible task inviting me at present, I\ndecided to undertake you--if you were willing.\"\n\n\"Why do you tell me this?\" she asked.  \"To discourage me?\"\n\n\"No.  Your vanity will prevent that.\"\n\n\"Then why?\"\n\n\"To clear myself of all responsibility for you.  You understand--I bind\nmyself to nothing.  I am free to stop or to go on at any time.\"\n\n\"And I?\" said Mildred.\n\n\"You must do exactly as I tell you.\"\n\n\"But that is not fair,\" cried she.\n\n\"Why not?\" inquired he.  \"Without me you have no hope--none whatever.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that,\" declared she.  \"It is not true.\"\n\n\"Very well.  Then we'll drop the business,\" said he tranquilly.  \"If\nthe time comes when you see that I'm your only hope, and if then I'm in\nmy present humor, we will go on.\"\n\nAnd he lapsed into silence from which she soon gave over trying to\nrouse him.  She thought of what he had said, studied him, but could\nmake nothing of it.  She let four days go by, days of increasing unrest\nand unhappiness.  She could not account for herself.  Donald Keith\nseemed to have cast a spell over her--an evil spell.  Her throat gave\nher more and more trouble.  She tried her voice, found that it had\nvanished. She examined herself in the glass, and saw or fancied that\nher looks were going--not so that others would note it, but in the\nsubtle ways that give the first alarm to a woman who has beauty worth\ntaking care of and thinks about it intelligently.  She thought Mrs.\nBrindley was beginning to doubt her, suspected a covert uneasiness in\nStanley.  Her foundations, such as they were, seemed tottering and\nready to disintegrate.  She saw her own past with clear vision for the\nfirst time--saw how futile she had been, and why Keith believed there\nwas no hope for her.  She made desperate efforts to stop thinking about\npast and future, to absorb herself in present comfort and luxury and\nopportunities for enjoyment.  But Keith was always there--and to see\nhim was to lose all capacity for enjoyment.  She was curt, almost rude\nto him--had some vague idea of forcing him to stay away.  Yet every\ntime she lost sight of him, she was in terror until she saw him again.\n\nShe was alone on the small veranda facing the high-road.  She happened\nto glance toward the station; her gaze became fixed, her body rigid,\nfor, coming leisurely and pompously toward the house, was General\nSiddall, in the full panoply of his wonderful tailoring and\nhaberdashery.  She thought of flight, but instantly knew that flight\nwas useless; the little general was not there by accident.  She waited,\nher rigidity giving her a deceptive seeming of calm and even ease.  He\nentered the little yard, taking off his glossy hat and exposing the\nrampant toupee.  He smiled at her so slightly that the angle of the\nneedle-pointed mustaches and imperial was not changed.  The cold,\nexpressionless, fishy eyes simply looked at her.\n\n\"A delightful little house,\" said he, with a patronizing glance around.\n\"May I sit down?\"\n\nShe inclined her head.\n\n\"And you are looking well, charming,\" he went on, and he seated himself\nand carefully planted his neat boots side by side.  \"For the summer\nthere's nothing equal to the seashore.  You are surprised to see me?\"\n\n\"I thought you were abroad,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"So I was--until yesterday.  I came back because my men had found you.\nAnd I'm here because I venture to hope that you have had enough of this\nfoolish escapade.  I hope we can come to an understanding. I've lost my\ntaste for wandering about.  I wish to settle down--to have a home and\nto stay in it.  By that I mean, of course, two or three--or possibly\nfour--houses, according to the season.\"  Mildred sent her glance\ndarting about.  The little general saw and began to talk more rapidly.\n\"I've given considerable thought to our--our misunderstanding.  I feel\nthat I gave too much importance to your--your--  I did not take your\nyouth and inexperience of the world and of married life sufficiently\ninto account.  Also the first Mrs. Siddall was not a lady--nor the\nsecond.  A lady, a young lady, was a new experience to me.  I am a\ngenerous man.  So I say frankly that I ought to have been more patient.\"\n\n\"You said you would never see me again until I came to you,\" said\nMildred.  As he was not looking at her, she watched his face.  She now\nsaw a change--behind the mask.  But he went on in an unchanged voice:\n\n\"Were you aware that Mrs. Baird is about to sue her husband for a\nseparation--not for a divorce but for a separation--and name you?\"\n\nMildred dropped limply back in her chair.\n\n\"That means scandal,\" continued Siddall, \"scandal touching my name--my\nhonor.  I may say, I do not believe what Mrs. Baird charges.  My men\nhave had you under observation for several weeks.  Also, Mrs. Brindley\nis, I learn, a woman of the highest character. But the thing looks\nbad--you hiding from your husband, living under an assumed name,\nreceiving the visits of a former admirer.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken,\" said Mildred.  \"Mrs. Baird would not bring such a\nfalse, wicked charge.\"\n\n\"You are innocent, my dear,\" said the general.\n\n\"You don't realize how your conduct looks.  She intends to charge that\nher husband has been supporting you.\"\n\nMildred, quivering, started up, sank weakly back again.\n\n\"But,\" he went on, \"you will easily prove that your money is your\ninheritance from your father.  I assured myself of that before I\nconsented to come here.\"\n\n\"Consented?\" said Mildred.  \"At whose request?\"\n\n\"That of my own generosity,\" replied he.  \"But my honor had to be\nreassured.  When I was satisfied that you were innocent, and simply\nflighty and foolish, I came.  If there had been any taint upon you, of\ncourse I could not have taken you back.  As it is, I am willing--I may\nsay, more than willing.  Mrs. Baird can be bought off and frightened\noff.  When she finds you have me to protect you, she will move very\ncautiously, you may be sure.\"\n\nAs the little man talked, Mildred saw and felt behind the mask the\nthoughts, the longings of his physical infatuation for her coiling and\nuncoiling and reaching tremulously out toward her like unclean,\nhorrible tentacles.  She was drawn as far as could be back into her\nchair, and her soul was shrinking within her body.\n\n\"I am willing to make you a proper allowance, and to give you all\nproper freedom,\" he went on.  He showed his sharp white teeth in a\ngracious smile.  \"I realize I must concede something of my\nold-fashioned ideas to the modern spirit.  I never thought I would, but\nI didn't appreciate how fond I was of you, my dear.\"  He mumbled his\ntongue and noiselessly smacked his thin lips.  \"Yes, you are worth\nconcessions and sacrifices.\"\n\n\"I am not going back,\" said Mildred.  \"Nothing you could offer me would\nmake any difference.\"  She felt suddenly calm and strong.  She stood.\n\"Please consider this final.\"\n\n\"But, my dear,\" said the general softly, though there was a wicked\ngleam behind the mask, \"you forget the scandal--\"\n\n\"I forget nothing,\" interrupted she.  \"I shall not go back.\"\n\nBefore he could attempt further to detain her she opened the screen\ndoor and entered.  It closed on the spring and on the spring lock.\n\nDonald Keith, coming in from the sea-front veranda, was just in time to\nsave her from falling.  She pushed him fiercely away and sank down on\nthe sofa just within the pretty little drawing-room.  She said:\n\n\"Thank you.  I didn't mean to be rude.  I was only angry with myself.\nI'm getting to be one of those absurd females who blubber and keel\nover.\"\n\n\"You're white and limp,\" said he.  \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"General Siddall is out there.\"\n\n\"Um--he's come back, has he?\" said Keith.\n\n\"And I am afraid of him--horribly afraid of him.\"\n\n\"In some places and circumstances he would be a dangerous proposition,\"\nsaid Keith.  \"But not here in the East--and not to you.\"\n\n\"He would do ANYTHING.  I don't know what he can do, but I am sure it\nwill be frightful--will destroy me.\"\n\n\"You are going with him?\"\n\nShe laughed.  \"I loathe him.  I thought I left him through fear and\nanger.  I was mistaken.  It was loathing.  And my fear of him--it's\nloathing, too.\"\n\n\"You mean that?\" said Keith, observing her intently.  \"You wish to be\nrid of him?\"\n\n\"What a poor opinion you have of me,\" said she. \"Really, I don't\ndeserve quite that.\"\n\n\"Then come with me.\"\n\nThe look of terror and shrinking returned. \"Where?  To see him?\"\n\n\"For the last time,\" said Keith.  \"There'll be no scene.\"\n\nIt was the supreme test of her confidence in him. Without hesitation,\nshe rose, preceded him into the hall, and advanced firmly toward the\nscreen door through which the little general could be seen.  He was\nstanding at the top step, his back to them.  At the sound of the\nopening door he turned.\n\n\"This is Mr. Donald Keith,\" said Mildred.  \"He wishes to speak to you.\"\n\nThe general bowed; Keith bent his head.  They eyed each other with the\nmeasuring glance.  Keith said in his dry, terse way:  \"I asked Miss\nGower to come with me because I wish her to hear what I have to say to\nyou.\"\n\n\"You mean my wife,\" said the general with a gracious smile.\n\n\"I mean Miss Gower,\" returned Keith.  \"As you know, she is not your\nwife.\"\n\nMildred uttered a cry; but the two men continued to look each at the\nother, with impassive countenances.\n\n\"Your only wife is the woman who has been in the private insane asylum\nof Doctor Rivers at Pueblo, Colorado, for the past eleven years.  For\nabout twenty years before that she was in the Delavan private asylum\nnear Denver.  You could not divorce her under the laws of Colorado. The\ndivorce you got in Nevada was fraudulent.\"\n\n\"That's a lie,\" said the general coldly.\n\nKeith went on, as if he had not heard:  \"You will not annoy this lady\nagain.  And you will stop bribing Stanley Baird's wife to make a fool\nof herself.  And you will stop buying houses in the blocks where Baird\nowns real estate, and moving colored families into them.\"\n\n\"I tell you that about my divorce is a lie,\" replied Siddall.\n\n\"I can prove it,\" said Keith.  \"And I can prove that you knew it before\nyou married your second wife.\"\n\nFor the first time Siddall betrayed at the surface a hint of how hard\nhe was hit.  His skin grew bright yellow; wrinkles round his eyes and\nround the base of his nose sprang into sudden prominence.\n\n\"I see you know what I mean--that attempt to falsify the record at\nCarson City,\" said Keith.  He opened the screen door for Mildred to\npass in.  He followed her, and the door closed behind them.  They went\ninto the drawing-room.  He dropped into an easy chair, crossed his\nlegs, leaned his head back indolently--a favorite attitude of his.\n\n\"How long have you known?\" said she.  Her cheeks were flushed with\nexcitement.\n\n\"Oh, a good many years,\" replied he.  \"It was one of those accidental\nbits of information a man runs across in knocking about.  As soon as\nBaird told me about you, I had the thing looked up, quietly.  I was\ngoing up to see him to-morrow--about the negroes and Mrs. Baird's suit.\"\n\n\"Does Stanley know?\" inquired she.\n\n\"No,\" said Keith.  \"Not necessary.  Never will be.  If you like, you\ncan have the marriage annulled without notoriety.  But that's not\nnecessary, either.\"\n\nAfter a long silence, she said:  \"What does this make out of me?\"\n\n\"You mean, what would be thought of you, if it were known?\" inquired\nhe.  \"Well, it probably wouldn't improve your social position.\"\n\n\"I am disgraced,\" said she, curiously rather than emotionally.\n\n\"Would be, if it were known,\" corrected he, \"and if you are nothing but\na woman without money looking for a husband.  If you happened to be a\nsinger or an actress, it would add to your reputation--make you more\ntalked about.\"\n\n\"But I am not an actress or a singer.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, I should say you didn't amount to much socially.\nExcept in Hanging Rock, of course--if there is still a Hanging Rock.\nDon't worry about your reputation.  Fussing and fretting about your\nsocial position doesn't help toward a career.\"\n\n\"Naturally, you take it coolly.  But you can hardly expect me to,\"\ncried she.\n\n\"You are taking it coolly,\" said he.  \"Then why try to work yourself up\ninto a fit of hysterics?  The thing is of no importance--except that\nyou're free now--will never be bothered by Siddall again.  You ought to\nthank me, and forget it.  Don't be one of the little people who are\nforever agitating about trifles.\"\n\nTrifles!  To speak of such things as trifles!  And yet--  Well, what\ndid they actually amount to in her life?  \"Yes, I AM free,\" she said\nthoughtfully.  \"I've got what I wanted--got it in the easiest way\npossible.\"\n\n\"That's better,\" said he approvingly.\n\n\"And I've burnt my bridges behind me,\" pursued she.  \"There's nothing\nfor me now but to go ahead.\"\n\n\"Which road?\" inquired he carelessly.\n\n\"The career,\" cried she.  \"There's no other for me. Of course I COULD\nmarry Stanley, when he's free, as he would be before very long, if I\nsuggested it.  Yes, I could marry him.\"\n\n\"Could you?\" observed he.\n\n\"Doesn't he love me?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"Then why do you say he would not marry me?\" demanded she.\n\n\"Did I say that?\"\n\n\"You insinuated it.  You suggested that there was a doubt.\"\n\n\"Then, there is no doubt?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is,\" she cried angrily.  \"You won't let me enjoy the least\nbit of a delusion.  He might marry me if I were famous.  But as I am\nnow--  He's an inbred snob.  He can't help it.  He simply couldn't\nmarry a woman in my position.  But you're overlooking one thing--that\n_I_ would not marry HIM.\"\n\n\"That's unimportant, if true,\" said Keith.\n\n\"You don't believe it?\"\n\n\"I don't care anything about it, my dear lady,\" said Keith.  \"Have you\ngot time to waste in thinking about how much I am in love with you?\nWhat a womanly woman you are, to be sure.  Your true woman, you know,\nnever thinks of anything but love--not how much she loves, but how much\nshe is loved.\"\n\n\"Be careful!\" she warned.  \"Some day you'll go too far in saying\noutrageous things to me.\"\n\n\"And then?\" said he smilingly.\n\n\"You care nothing for our friendship?\"\n\n\"The experiment is the only interest I have in you,\" replied he.\n\n\"That is not true,\" said she.  \"You have always liked me.  That's why\nyou looked up my hus-- General Siddall and got ready for him. That's\nwhy you saved me to-day.  You are a very tender-hearted and generous\nman--and you hide it as you do everything else about yourself.\"\n\nHe was looking off into space from the depths of the easy chair, a\nmocking smile on his classical, impassive face.\n\n\"What puzzles me,\" she went on, \"is why you interest yourself in as\nvain and shallow and vacillating a woman as I am.  You don't care for\nmy looks--and that's all there is to me.\"\n\n\"Don't pause to be contradicted,\" said he.\n\nShe was in a fine humor now.  \"You might at least have said I was up to\nthe female average, for I am. What have they got to offer a man but\ntheir looks? Do you know why I despise men?\"\n\n\"Do you?\"\n\n\"I do.  And it's because they put up with women as much as they\ndo--spend so much money on them, listen to their chatter, admire their\nridiculous clothes. Oh, I understand why.  I've learned that.  And I\ncan imagine myself putting up with anything in some one man I happened\nto fancy strongly.  But men are foolish about the whole sex--or all of\nthem that have a shadow of a claim to good looks.\"\n\n\"Yes, the men make fools of themselves,\" admitted he.  \"But I notice\nthat the men manage somehow to make the careers, and hold on to the\nmoney and the power, while the women have to wheedle and fawn and\nsubmit in order to get what they want from the men. There's nothing to\nbe said for your sex.  It's been hopelessly corrupted by mine.  For all\nthe talk about the influence of woman, what impression has your sex\nmade upon mine?  And your sex--it has been made by mine into exactly\nwhat we wished it to be.  Take my advice, get out of your sex.  Abandon\nit, and make a career.\"\n\nAfter a while she recalled with a start the events of less than an hour\nago--events that ought to have seemed wildly exciting, arousing the\ndeepest and strongest emotions.  Yet they had made no impression upon\nher.  Absolutely none.  She had no horror in the thought that she had\nbeen the victim of a bigamist; she had no elation over her release into\nfreedom and safety.  She wondered whether this arose from utter\nfrivolousness or from indifference to the trifles of conventional joys,\nsorrows, agitations, excitements which are the whole life of most\npeople--that indifference which is the cause of the general opinion\nthat men and women who make careers are usually hardened in the process.\n\nAs she lay awake that night--she had got a very bad habit of lying\nawake hour after hour--she suddenly came to a decision.  But she did\nnot tell Keith for several days.  She did it in this way:\n\n\"Don't you think I'm looking better?\" she asked.\n\n\"You're sleeping again,\" said he.\n\n\"Do you know why?  Because my mind's at rest. I've decided to accept\nyour offer.\"\n\n\"And my terms?\" said he, apparently not interested by her announcement.\n\n\"And your terms,\" assented she.  \"You are free to stop whenever the\nwhim strikes you; I must do exactly as you bid.  What do you wish me to\ndo?\"\n\n\"Nothing at present,\" replied he.  \"I will let you know.\"\n\nShe was disappointed.  She had assumed that something--something new\nand interesting, probably irritating, perhaps enraging, would occur at\nonce.  His indifference, his putting off to a future time, which his\nmanner made seem most hazily indefinite, gave her the foolish and\ncollapsing sense of having broken through an open door.\n\n\n\nVII\n\nTHE first of September they went up to town. Stanley left at once for\nhis annual shooting trip; Donald Keith disappeared, saying--as was his\nhabit--neither what he was about nor when he would be seen again. Mrs.\nBrindley summoned her pupils and her musical friends.  Mildred resumed\nthe lessons with Jennings.  There was no doubt about it, she had\nastonishingly improved during the summer.  There had come--or, rather,\nhad come back--into her voice the birdlike quality, free, joyous,\nspontaneous, that had not been there since her father's death and the\nfamily's downfall.  She was glad that her arrangement with Donald Keith\nwas of such a nature that she was really not bound to go on with it--if\nhe should ever come back and remind her of what she had said.  Now that\nJennings was enthusiastic--giving just and deserved praise, as her own\near and Mrs. Brindley assured her, she was angry at herself for having\ntolerated Keith's frankness, his insolence, his insulting and\ncontemptuous denials of her ability.  She was impatient to see him,\nthat she might put him down.  She said to Jennings:\n\n\"You think I can make a career?\"\n\n\"There isn't a doubt in my mind now,\" replied he. \"You ought to be one\nof the few great lyric sopranos within five years.\"\n\n\"A man, this summer--a really unusual man in some ways--told me there\nwas no hope for me.\"\n\n\"A singing teacher?\"\n\n\"No, a lawyer.  A Mr. Keith--Donald Keith.\"\n\n\"I've heard of him,\" said Jennings.  \"His mother was Rivi, the famous\ncoloratura of twenty years ago.\"\n\nMildred was astounded.  \"He must know something about music.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" replied Jennings.  \"He lived with her in Italy, I believe,\nuntil he was almost grown.  Then she died.  You sang for him?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mildred said it hesitatingly.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Jennings, and his expression--interested, disturbed,\npuzzled--made Mildred understand why she had been so reluctant to\nconfess.  Jennings did not pursue the subject, but abruptly began the\nlesson.  That day and several days thereafter he put her to tests he\nhad never used before.  She saw that he was searching for\nsomething--for the flaw implied in the adverse verdict of the son of\nLucia Rivi.  She was enormously relieved when he gave over the search\nwithout having found the flaw.  She felt that Donald Keith's verdict\nhad been proved false or at least faulty. Yet she was not wholly\nreassured, and from time to time she suspected that Jennings had not\nbeen, either.\n\nSoon the gayety of the preceding winter and spring was in full swing\nagain.  Keith did not return, did not write, and Cyrilla Brindley\ninquired and telephoned in vain.  Mildred worked with enthusiasm, with\nhope, presently with confidence.  She hoped every day that Keith would\ncome; she would make him listen to her, force him to admit.  She caught\na slight cold, neglected it, tried to sing it away.  Her voice left her\nabruptly.  She went to Jennings as usual the day she found herself able\nto do nothing more musical than squeak.  She told him her plight.  Said\nhe:\n\n\"Begin!  Let's hear.\"\n\nShe made a few dismal attempts, stopped short, and, half laughing, half\nashamed, faced him for the lecture she knew would be forthcoming.  Now,\nit so happened that Jennings was in a frightful humor that day--one of\nthose humors in which the most prudent lose their self-control.  He had\nbeen listening to a succession of new pupils--women with money and no\nvoice, women who screeched and screamed and thoroughly enjoyed\nthemselves and angled confidently for compliments.  As Jennings had an\nacute musical ear, his sufferings had been frightful.  He was used to\nthese torments, had the habit of turning the fury into which they put\nhim into excellent financial or disciplinary account.  But on this\nparticular day his nerves went to pieces, and it was with Mildred that\nthe explosion came.  When she looked at him, she was horrified to see a\nface distorted and discolored by sheer rage.\n\n\"You fool!\" he shouted, storming up and down. \"You fool!  You can't\nsing!  Keith was right.  You wouldn't do even for a church choir.  You\ncan't be relied on.  There's nothing behind your voice--no strength, no\nendurance, no brains.  No brains!  Do you hear?--no brains, I say!\"\n\nMildred was terrified.  She had seen him in tantrums before, but always\nthere had been a judicious reserving of part of the truth.  Instead of\nresenting, instead of flashing eye or quivering lips, Mildred sat down\nand with white face and dazed eyes stared straight before her. Jennings\nraved and roared himself out.  As he came to his senses from this\ndebauch of truth-telling his first thought was how expensive it might\nbe.  Thus, long before there was any outward sign that the storm had\npassed, the ravings, the insults were shrewdly tempered with\nqualifyings.  If she kept on catching these colds, if she did not obey\nhis instructions, she might put off her debut for years--for three\nyears, for two years at least.  And she would always be rowing with\nmanagers and irritating the public--and so on and on.  But the mischief\nhad been done.  The girl did not rouse.\n\n\"No use to go on to-day,\" he said gruffly--the pretense at last\nrumblings of an expiring storm.\n\n\"Nor any other day,\" said Mildred.\n\nShe stood and straightened herself.  Her face was beautiful rather than\nlovely.  Its pallor, its strong lines, the melancholy intensity of the\neyes, made her seem more the woman fully developed, less, far less, the\nmaturing girl.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" scolded Jennings.  \"But no more colds like that.  They\nimpair the quality of the voice.\"\n\n\"I have no voice,\" said the girl.  \"I see the truth.\"\n\nJennings was inwardly cursing his insane temper. In about the kindliest\ntone he had ever used with her, he said:  \"My dear Miss Stevens, you\nare in no condition to judge to-day.  Come back to-morrow.  Do\nsomething for that cold to-night.  Clear out the throat--and come back\nto-morrow.  You will see.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know those tricks,\" said she, with a sad little smile.  \"You\ncan make a crow seem to sing.  But you told me the truth.\"\n\n\"To-morrow,\" he cried pleasantly, giving her an encouraging pat on the\nshoulder.  He knew the folly of talking too much, the danger of\nconfirming her fears by pretending to make light of them.  \"A good\nsleep, and to-morrow things will look brighter.\"\n\nHe did not like her expression.  It was not the one he was used to\nseeing in those vain, \"temperamental\" pupils of his--the downcast\nvanity that will be up again in a few hours.  It was rather the\nexpression of one who has been finally and forever disillusioned.\n\nOn her way home she stopped to send Keith a telegram:  \"I must see you\nat once.\"\n\nThere were several at the apartment for tea, among them Cullan, an\namateur violinist and critic on music whom she especially liked.  For,\ninstead of the dreamy, romantic character his large brown eyes and\nsensitive features suggested, he revealed in talk and actions a boyish\ngayety--free, be it said, from boyish silliness--that was most\ninfectious.  His was one of those souls that put us in the mood to\nlaugh at all seriousness, to forget all else in the supreme fact of the\nreality of existence.  He made her forget that day--forget until\nKeith's answering telegram interrupted:  \"Next Monday afternoon.\"\n\nA week less a day away!  She shrank and trembled at the prospect of\nrelying upon herself alone for six long days.  Every prop had been\ntaken away from her. Even the dubious prop of the strange,\nunsatisfactory Keith.  For had he not failed her?  She had said, \"must\"\nand \"at once\"; and he had responded with three words of curt refusal.\n\nAfter dinner Stanley unexpectedly appeared.  He hardly waited for the\nnecessary formalities of the greeting before he said to Mrs. Brindley:\n\"I want to see Mildred alone.  I know you won't mind, Mrs. Brindley.\nIt's very important.\"  He laughed nervously but cheerfully. \"And in a\nfew minutes I'll call you in.  I think I'll have something interesting\nto tell you.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley laughed.  With her cigarette in one hand and her cup of\nafter-dinner coffee in the other, she moved toward the door, saying\ngayly to Mildred:\n\n\"I'll be in the next room.  If you scream I shall hear.  So don't be\nalarmed.\"\n\nStanley closed the door, turned beaming upon Mildred.  Said he: \"Here's\nmy news.  My missus has got her divorce.\"\n\nMildred started up.\n\n\"Yes, the real thing,\" he assured her.  \"Of course I knew what was\ndoing.  But I kept mum--didn't want to say anything to you till I could\nsay everything. Mildred, I'm free.  We can be married to-morrow, if you\nwill.\"\n\n\"Then you know about me?\" said she, confused.\n\n\"On the way I stopped in to see Keith.  He told me about that\nskunk--told me you were free, too.\"\n\nMildred slowly sat down.  Her elbows rested upon the table.  There was\nher bare forearm, slender and round, and her long, graceful fingers lay\nagainst her cheek.  The light from above reflected charmingly from the\nsoft waves and curves of her hair.  \"You're lovely--simply lovely!\"\ncried Stanley.  \"Mildred--darling--you WILL marry me, won't you?  You\ncan go right on with the career, if you like.  In fact, I'd rather you\nwould, for I'm frightfully proud of your voice.  And I've changed a lot\nsince I became sincerely interested in you.  The other sort of life and\npeople don't amuse me any more.  Mildred, say you'll marry me.  I'll\nmake you as happy as the days are long.\"\n\nShe moved slightly.  Her hand dropped to the table.\n\n\"I guess I came down on you too suddenly,\" said he.  \"You look a bit\ndazed.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not dazed,\" replied she.\n\n\"I'll call Mrs. Brindley in, and we'll all three talk it over.\"\n\n\"Please don't,\" said she.  \"I've got to think it out for myself.\"\n\n\"I know there isn't anyone else,\" he went on.  \"So, I'm sure--dead\nsure, Mildred, that I can teach you to love me.\"\n\nShe looked at him pleadingly.  \"I don't have to answer right away?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" laughed he.  \"But why shouldn't you?  What is there\nagainst our getting married? Nothing.  And everything for it.  Our\nmarriage will straighten out all the--the little difficulties, and you\ncan go ahead with the singing and not bother about money, or what\npeople might say, or any of those things.\"\n\n\"I--I've got to think about it, Stanley,\" she said gently.  \"I want to\ndo the decent thing by you and by myself.\"\n\n\"You're afraid I'll interfere in the career--won't want you to go on?\nMildred, I swear I'm--\"\n\n\"It isn't that,\" she interrupted, her color high. \"The truth is--\" she\nfaltered, came to a full stop--cried, \"Oh, I can't talk about it\nto-night.\"\n\n\"To-morrow?\" he suggested.\n\n\"I--don't know,\" she stammered.  \"Perhaps to-morrow.  But it may be two\nor three days.\"\n\nStanley looked crestfallen.  \"That hurts, Mildred,\" he said.  \"I was SO\nfull of it, so anxious to be entirely happy, and I thought you'd fall\nright in with it. Something to do with money?  You're horribly\nsensitive about money, dear.  I like that in you, of course. Not many\nwomen would have been as square, would have taken as little--and worked\nhard--and thought and cared about nothing but making good--  By Jove,\nit's no wonder I'm stark crazy about YOU!\"\n\nShe was flushed and trembling.  \"Don't,\" she pleaded.  \"You're beating\nme down into the dust.  I--I'm--\"  She started up.  \"I can't talk\nto-night. I might say things I'd be--  I can't talk about it.  I must--\"\n\nShe pressed her lips together and fled through the hall to her own\nroom, to shut and lock herself in.  He stared in amazement.  When he\nheard the distant sound of the turning key he dropped to a chair again\nand laughed.  Certainly women were queer creatures--always doing what\none didn't expect.  Still, in the end--well, a sensible woman knew a\ngood chance to marry and took it.  There was no doubt a good deal of\npretense in Mildred's delicacy as to money matters--but a devilish\ncreditable sort of pretense.  He liked the ladylike, \"nice\" pretenses,\nof women of the right sort--liked them when they fooled him, liked them\nwhen they only half fooled him.\n\nPresently he knocked on the door of the little library, opened it when\npermission came in Cyrilla's voice.  She was reading the evening\npaper--he did not see the glasses she hastily thrust into a drawer.  In\nthat soft light she looked a scant thirty, handsome, but for his taste\ntoo intellectual of type to be attractive--except as a friend.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, as he lit a cigarette and dropped the match into the\nbig copper ash-bowl, \"I'll bet you can't guess what I've been up to.\"\n\n\"Making love to Miss Stevens,\" replied she.  \"And very foolish it is of\nyou.  She's got a steady head in that way.\"\n\n\"You're mighty right,\" said he heartily.  \"And I admire her for that\nmore than for anything else.  I'd trust her anywhere.\"\n\n\"You're paying yourself a high compliment,\" laughed Cyrilla.\n\n\"How's that?\" inquired he.  \"You're too subtle for me.  I'm a bit slow.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley decided against explaining.  It was not wise to risk\nraising an unjust doubt in the mind of a man who fancied that a woman\nwho resisted him would be adamant to every other man.  \"Then I've got\nto guess again?\" said she.\n\n\"I've been asking her to marry me,\" said Stanley, who could contain it\nno longer.  \"Mrs. B. was released from me to-day by the court in\nProvidence.\"\n\n\"But SHE'S not free,\" said Cyrilla, a little severely.\n\nStanley looked confused, finally said:  \"Yes, she is. It's a queer\nstory.  Don't say anything.  I can't explain.  I know I can trust you\nto keep a close mouth.\"\n\n\"Minding my own business is my one supreme talent,\" said Cyrilla.\n\n\"She hasn't accepted me--in so many words,\" pursued Baird, \"but I've\nhopes that it'll come out all right.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" commented Cyrilla dryly.\n\n\"I know I'm not--not objectionable to her.  And how I do love her!\"  He\nsettled himself at his ease. \"I can't believe it's really me.  I never\nthought I'd marry--just for love.  Did you?\"\n\n\"You're very self-indulgent,\" said Cyrilla.\n\n\"You mean I'm marrying her because I can't get her any other way.\nThere's where you're wrong, Mrs. Brindley.  I'm marrying her because I\ndon't want her any other way.  That's why I know it's love.  I didn't\nthink I was capable of it.  Of course, I've been rather strong after\nthe ladies all my life.  You know how it is with men.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Mrs. Brindley.\n\n\"No, you don't either,\" retorted he.  \"You're one of those cold,\nstand-me-off women who can't comprehend the nature of man.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" said she.  In her eyes there was a gleam that more\nthan suggested a possibility of some man--some man she might\nfancy--seeing an amazingly different Cyrilla Brindley.\n\n\"I may say I was daft about pretty women,\" continued Baird.  \"I never\nread an item about a pretty woman in the papers, or saw a picture of a\npretty woman that I didn't wish I knew her--well.  Can you imagine\nthat?\" laughed he.\n\n\"Commonplace,\" said Cyrilla.  \"All men are so. That's why the papers\nalways describe the woman as pretty and why the pictures are published.\"\n\n\"Really?  Yes, I suppose so.\"  Baird looked chagrined.  \"Anyhow, here I\nam, all for one woman. And why?  I can't explain it to myself.  She's\npretty, lovely, entrancing sometimes.  She has charm, grace, sweetness.\nShe dresses well and carries herself with a kind of sweet haughtiness.\nShe looks as if she knew a lot--and nothing bad.  Do you know, I can't\nimagine her having been married to that beast!  I've tried to imagine\nit.  I simply can't.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't try if I were you,\" said Mrs. Brindley.\n\n\"But I was talking about why I love her.  Does this bore you?\"\n\n\"A little,\" laughed Cyrilla.  \"I'd rather hear some man talking about\nMY charms.  But go on.  You are amusing, in a way.\"\n\n\"I'll wager I am.  You never thought I'd be caught? I believed I was\nimmune--vaccinated against it. I thought I knew all the tricks and\nturns of the sex. Yet here I am!\"\n\n\"What do you think caught you?\"\n\n\"That's the mystery.  It's simply that I can't do without her.\nEverything she looks and says and does interests me more than anything\nelse in the world.  And when I'm not with her I'm wishing I were and\nwondering how she's looking or what she's saying or doing.  You don't\nthink she'll refuse me?\"  This last with real anxiety.\n\n\"I haven't an idea,\" replied Mrs. Brindley.  \"She's--peculiar.  In some\nmoods she would.  In others, she couldn't.  And I've never been able to\nsettle to my satisfaction which kind of mood was the real Mary Stevens.\"\n\n\"She IS queer, isn't she?\" said Stanley thoughtfully. \"But I've told\nher she'd be free to go on with the career. Fact is, I want her to do\nit.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley's eyes twinkled.  \"You think it would justify you to your\nset in marrying her, if she made a great hit?\"\n\nStanley blushed ingenuously.  \"I'll not deny that has something to do\nwith it,\" he admitted.  \"And why not?\"\n\n\"Why not, indeed?\" said she.  \"But, after she had made the hit, you'd\nwant her to quit the stage and take her place in society.  Isn't that\nso?\"\n\n\"You ARE a keen one,\" exclaimed he admiringly. \"But I didn't say that\nto her.  And you won't, will you?\"\n\n\"It's hardly necessary to ask that,\" said Mrs. Brindley.  \"Now,\nsuppose--  You don't mind my talking about this?\"\n\n\"What I want,\" replied he.  \"I can't talk or think anything but her.\"\n\n\"Now, suppose she shouldn't make a hit.  Suppose she should\nfail--should not develop reliable voice enough?\"\n\nStanley looked frightened.  \"But she can't fail,\" he cried with\nover-energy.  \"There's no question about her voice.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Mrs. Brindley hastened to say.  \"I was simply making\nconversation with her as the subject.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\"  Stanley settled back.\n\n\"Suppose she should prove not to be a great artist--what then?\"\npersisted Cyrilla, who was deeply interested in the intricate obscure\nproblem of what people really thought as distinguished from what they\nprofessed and also from what they imagined they thought.\n\n\"The fact that she's a great artist--that's part of her,\" said Baird.\n\"If she weren't a great singer, she wouldn't be she--don't you see?\"\n\n\"Yes, I see,\" said Mrs. Brindley with an ironic sadness which she\nindulged openly because there was no danger of his understanding.\n\n\"I don't exactly love her because she amounts to a lot--or is sure to,\"\npursued he, vaguely dissatisfied with himself.  \"It's just as she\ndoesn't care for me because I've got the means to take care of her\nright, yet that's part of me--and she'd not be able to marry me if I\nhadn't.  Don't you see?\"\n\n\"Yes, I see,\" said Mrs. Brindley with more irony and less sadness.\n\"There's always SOME reason beside love.\"\n\n\"I'd say there's always some reason FOR love,\" said Baird, and he felt\nthat he had said something brilliant--as is the habit of people of\nsluggish mentality when they say a thing they do not themselves\nunderstand. \"You don't doubt that I love her?\" he went on.  \"Why should\nI ask her to marry me if I didn't?\"\n\n\"I suppose that settles it,\" said Cyrilla.\n\n\"Of course it does,\" declared he.\n\nFor an hour he sat there, talking on, most of it a pretty dull kind of\ndrivel.  Mrs. Brindley listened patiently, because she liked him and\nbecause she had nothing else to do until bedtime.  At last he rose with\na long sigh and said:\n\n\"I guess I might as well be going.\"\n\n\"She'll not come in to-night again,\" said Cyrilla slyly.\n\nHe laughed.  \"You are a good one.  I'll own up, I've been staying on\npartly in the hope that she'd come back.  But it's been a great joy to\ntalk to you about her.  I know you love her, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm extremely fond of her,\" said she.  \"I've not known many\nwomen--many people without petty mean tricks.  She's one.\"\n\n\"Isn't she, though?\" exclaimed he.\n\n\"I don't mean she's perfect,\" said Mrs. Brindley. \"I don't even mean\nthat she's as angelic as you think her.  I'd not like her, if she were.\nBut she's a superior kind of human.\"\n\nShe was tired of him now, and got him out speedily. As she closed the\nfront door upon him, Mildred's door, down the hall, opened.  Her head\nappeared, an inquiring look upon her face.  Mrs. Brindley nodded.\nMildred, her hair done close to her head, a dressing-robe over her\nnightgown and her bare feet in little slippers, came down the hall. She\ncoiled herself up in a big chair in the library and lit a cigarette.\nShe looked like a handsome young boy.\n\n\"He told you?\" she said to Mrs. Brindley.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Cyrilla.\n\nSilence.  In all their intimate acquaintance there had never been an\napproach to the confidential on either side.  It was Cyrilla's notion\nthat confidences were a mistake, and that the more closely people were\nthrown together the more resolutely they ought to keep certain barriers\nbetween them.  She and Mildred got on too admirably, liked each other\ntoo well, for there to be any trifling with their relations--and\nover-intimacy inevitably led to trifling.  Mildred had restrained\nherself because Mrs. Brindley had compelled it by rigid example.  Often\nshe had longed to talk things over, to ask advice; but she had never\nventured further than generalities, and Mrs. Brindley had never\nproffered advice, had never accepted opportunities to give it except in\nthe vaguest way.  She had taught Mildred a great deal, but always by\nexample, by doing, never by saying what ought or ought not to be done.\nThus, such development of Mildred's character as there had been was\nnatural and permanent.\n\n\"He has put me in a peculiar position,\" said Mildred.  \"Or, rather, I\nhave let myself drift into a peculiar position.  For I think you're\nright in saying that oneself is always to blame.  Won't you let me talk\nabout it to you, please?  I know you hate confidences. But I've got\nto--to talk.  I'd like you to advise me, if you can.  But even if you\ndon't, it'll do me good to say things aloud.\"\n\n\"Often one sees more clearly,\" was Cyrilla's reply--noncommittal, yet\nnot discouraging.\n\n\"I'm free to marry him,\" Mildred went on.  \"That is, I'm not married.\nI'd rather not explain--\"\n\n\"Don't,\" said Mrs. Brindley.  \"It's unnecessary.\"\n\n\"You know that it's Stanley who has been lending me the money to live\non while I study.  Well, from the beginning I've been afraid I'd find\nmyself in a difficult position.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Mrs. Brindley, as she paused.\n\n\"But I've always expected it to come in another way--not about\nmarriage, but--\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Mrs. Brindley.  \"You feared you'd be called on to\npay in the way women usually pay debts to men.\"\n\nMildred nodded.  \"But this is worse than I expected--much worse.\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought of that,\" said Cyrilla.  \"Yes, you're right.  If he\nhad hinted the other thing, you could have pretended not to understand.\nIf he had suggested it, you could have made him feel cheap and mean.\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Mildred.  \"He has been--really wonderful--better than\nalmost any man would have been--more considerate than I deserved.  And\nI took advantage of it.\"\n\n\"A woman has to,\" said Cyrilla.  \"The fight between men and women is so\nunequal.\"\n\n\"I took advantage of him,\" repeated Mildred. \"And he apologized, and\nI--I went on taking the money.  I didn't know what else to do.  Isn't\nthat dreadful?\"\n\n\"Nothing to be proud of,\" said Cyrilla.  \"But a very usual transaction.\"\n\n\"And then,\" pursued Mildred, \"I discovered that I--that I'd not be able\nto make a career.  But still I kept on, though I've been trying to\nforce myself to--to show some pride and self-respect.  I discovered it\nonly a short time ago, and it wasn't really until to-day that I was\nabsolutely sure.\"\n\n\"You ARE sure?\"\n\n\"There's hardly a doubt,\" replied Mildred.  \"But never mind that now.\nI've got to make a living at something, and while I'm learning whatever\nit is, I've got to have money to live on.  And I can get it only from\nhim.  Now, he asks me to marry him.  He wouldn't ask me if he didn't\nthink I was going to be a great singer.  He doesn't know it, but I do.\"\n\nMrs. Brindley smiled sweetly.\n\n\"And he thinks that I love him, also.  If I accept him, it will be\nunder doubly false pretenses.  If I refuse him I've got to stop taking\nthe money.\"\n\nA long silence; then Mrs. Brindley said:  \"Women--the good ones,\ntoo--often feel that they've a right to treat men as men treat them.  I\nthink almost any woman would feel justified in putting off the crisis.\"\n\n\"You mean, I might tell him I'd give him my answer when I was\nindependent and had paid back.\"\n\nCyrilla nodded.  Mildred relit her cigarette, which she had let go out.\n\"I had thought of that,\" said she. \"But--I doubt if he'd tolerate it.\nAlso\"--she laughed with the peculiar intonation that accompanies the\nlifting of the veil over a deeply and carefully hidden corner of one's\nsecret self--\"I am afraid.  If I don't marry him, in a few weeks, or\nmonths at most, he'll probably find out that I shall never be a great\nsinger, and then I'd not be able to marry him if I wished to.\"\n\n\"He IS a temptation,\" said Cyrilla.  \"That is, his money is--and he\npersonally is very nice.\"\n\n\"I married a man I didn't care for,\" pursued Mildred.  \"I don't want\never to do that again.  It is--even in the best circumstances--not\nagreeable, not as simple as it looks to the inexperienced girls who are\nalways doing it.\"\n\n\"Still, a woman can endure that sort of thing,\" said Mrs. Brindley,\n\"unless she happens to be in love with another man.\"  She was observing\nthe unconscious Mildred narrowly, a state of inward tension and\nexcitement hinted in her face, but not in her voice.\n\n\"That's just it?\" said Mildred, her face carefully averted.  \"I--I\nhappen to be in love with another man.\"\n\nA spasm of pain crossed Cyrilla's face.\n\n\"A man who cares nothing about me--and never will.  He's just a\nfriend--so much the friend that he couldn't possibly think of me as--as\na woman, needing him and wanting him\"--her eyes were on fire now, and a\nsoft glow had come into her cheeks--\"and never daring to show it\nbecause if I did he would fly and never let me see him again.\"\n\nCyrilla Brindley's face was tragic as she looked at the beautiful girl,\nso gracefully adjusted to the big chair.  She sighed covertly.  \"You\nare lovely,\" she said, \"and young--above all, young.\"\n\n\"This man is peculiar,\" replied Mildred forlornly. \"Anyhow, he doesn't\nwant ME.  He knows me for the futile, weak, worthless creature I am. He\nsaw through my bluff, even before I saw through it myself.  If it\nweren't for him, I could go ahead--do the sensible thing--do as women\nusually do.  But--\"  She came to a full stop.\n\n\"Love is a woman's sense of honor,\" said Cyrilla softly.  \"We're\nmerciless and unscrupulous--anything--everything--where we don't love.\nBut where we do love, we'll go farther for honor than the most\nhonorable man.  That's why we're both worse and better than men--and\nseem to be so contradictory and puzzling.\"\n\n\"I'd do anything for him,\" said Mildred.  She smiled drearily.  \"And he\nwants nothing.\"\n\nShe had nothing more to say.  She had talked herself out about Stanley,\nand her mind was now filled with thoughts that could not be spoken.  As\nshe rose to go to bed, she looked appealingly at Cyrilla.  Then, with a\nsudden and shy rush she flung her arms round her and kissed her. \"Thank\nyou--so much,\" she said. \"You've done me a world of good. Saying it all\nout loud before YOU has made me see.  I know my own mind, now.\"\n\nShe did not note the pathetic tenderness of Cyrilla's face as she said,\n\"Good night, Mildred.\"  But she did note the use of her first name--and\nher own right first name--for the first time since they had known each\nother.  She embraced and kissed her again.  \"Good night, Cyrilla,\" she\nsaid gratefully.\n\n\nAs she entered Jennings's studio the next day he looked at her; and\nwhen Jennings looked, he saw--as must anyone who lives well by playing\nupon human nature. He did not like her expression.  She did not\nhabitually smile; her light-heartedness, her optimism, did not show\nthemselves in that inane way.  But this seriousness of hers was of a\nnew kind, of the kind that bespeaks sobriety and saneness of soul.  And\nthat kind of seriousness--the deep, inward gravity of a person whose\ndays of trifling with themselves and with the facts of life, and of\nbeing trifled with, are over--would have impressed Jennings equally had\nshe come in laughing, had her every word been a jest.\n\n\"No, I didn't come for a lesson--at least not the usual kind,\" said she.\n\nHe was not one to yield without a struggle.  Also he wished to feel his\nway to the meaning of this new mood.  He put her music on the rack.\n\"We'll begin where we--\"\n\n\"This half-hour of your time is mine, is it not?\" said she quietly.\n\"Let's not waste any of it.  Yesterday you told me that I could not\nhope to make a career because my voice is unreliable.  Why is it\nunreliable?\"\n\n\"Because you have a delicate throat,\" replied he, yielding at once\nwhere he instinctively knew he could not win.\n\n\"Then why can I sing so well sometimes?\"\n\n\"Because your throat is in good condition some days--in perfect\ncondition.\"\n\n\"It's the colds then--and the slight attacks of colds?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"If I did not catch colds--if I kept perfectly well--could I rely on my\nvoice?\"\n\n\"But that's impossible,\" said he.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You're not strong enough.\"\n\n\"Then I haven't the physical strength for a career?\"\n\n\"That--and also you are lacking in muscular development.  But after\nseveral years of lessons--\"\n\n\"If I developed my muscles--if I became strong--\"\n\n\"Most of the great singers come from the lower classes--from people who\ndo manual labor.  They did manual labor in their youth.  You girls of\nthe better class have to overcome that handicap.\"\n\n\"But so many of the great singers are fat.\"\n\n\"Yes, and under that fat you'll find great ropes of muscle--like a\nblacksmith.\"\n\n\"What Keith meant,\" she said.  \"I wonder--  Why do I catch cold so\neasily?  Why do I almost always have a slight catch in the throat? Have\nyou noticed that I nearly always have to clear my throat just a little?\"\n\nHer expression held him.  He hesitated, tried to evade, gave it up.\n\"Until that passes, you can never hope to be a thoroughly reliable\nsinger,\" said he.\n\n\"That is, I can't hope to make a career?\"\n\nHis silence was assent.\n\n\"But I have the voice?\"\n\n\"You have the voice.\"\n\n\"An unusual voice?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not so unusual as might be thought.  As a matter of fact,\nthere are thousands of fine voices. The trouble is in reliability. Only\na few are reliable.\"\n\nShe nodded slowly and thoughtfully.  \"I begin to understand what Mr.\nKeith meant,\" she said.  \"I begin to see what I have to do, and\nhow--how impossible it is.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" declared Jennings.  \"If I did not think otherwise, I'd\nnot be giving my time to you.\"\n\nShe looked at him gravely.  His eyes shifted, then returned defiantly,\naggressively.  She said:\n\n\"You can't help me to what I want.  So this is my last lesson--for the\npresent.  I may come back some day--when I am ready for what you have\nto give.\"\n\n\"You are going to give up?\"\n\n\"Oh, no--oh, dear me, no,\" replied she.  \"I realize that you're\nlaughing in your sleeve as I say so, because you think I'll never get\nanywhere.  But you--and Mr. Keith--may be mistaken.\"  She drew from her\nmuff a piece of music--the \"Batti Batti,\" from \"Don Giovanni.\"  \"If you\nplease,\" said she, \"we'll spend the rest of my time in going over this.\nI want to be able to sing it as well as possible.\"\n\nHe looked searchingly at her.  \"If you wish,\" said he.  \"But I doubt if\nyou'll be able to sing at all.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, my cold's entirely gone,\" replied she.  \"I had an\nexciting evening, I doctored myself before I went to bed, and three or\nfour times in the night. I found, this morning, that I could sing.\"\n\nAnd it was so.  Never had she sung better.  \"Like a true artist!\" he\ndeclared with an enthusiasm that had a foundation of sincerity.  \"You\nknow, Miss Stevens, you came very near to having that rarest of all\ngifts--a naturally placed voice.  If you hadn't had singing teachers as\na girl to make you self-conscious and to teach you wrong, you'd have\nbeen a wonder.\"\n\n\"I may get it back,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"That never happens,\" replied he.  \"But I can almost do it.\"\n\nHe coached her for half an hour straight ahead, sending the next pupil\ninto the adjoining room--an unprecedented transgression of routine.  He\nshowed her for the first time what a teacher he could be, when he\nwished.  There was an astonishing difference between her first singing\nof the song and her sixth and last--for they went through it carefully\nfive times.  She thanked him and then put out her hand, saying:\n\n\"This is a long good-by.\"\n\n\"To-morrow,\" replied he, ignoring her hand.\n\n\"No.  My money is all gone.  Besides, I have no time for amateur\ntrifling.\"\n\n\"Your lessons are paid for until the end of the month.  This is only\nthe nineteenth.\"\n\n\"Then you are so much in.\"  Again she put out her hand.\n\nHe took it.  \"You owe me an explanation.\"\n\nShe smiled mockingly.  \"As a friend of mine says, don't ask questions\nto which you already know the answer.\"\n\nAnd she departed, the smile still on her charming face, but the new\nseriousness beneath it.  As she had anticipated, she found Stanley\nBaird waiting for her in the drawing-room of the apartment.  Being by\nhabit much interested in his own emotions and not at all in the\nemotions of others, he saw only the healthful radiance the sharp\nOctober air had put into her cheeks and eyes.  Certainly, to look at\nMildred Gower was to get no impression of lack of health and strength.\nHer glance wavered a little at sight of him, then the expression of\nfirmness came back.\n\n\"You look like that picture you gave me a long time ago,\" said he.  \"Do\nyou remember it?\"\n\nShe did not.\n\n\"It has a--different expression,\" he went on.  \"I don't think I'd have\nnoticed it but for Keith.  I happened to show it to him one day, and he\nstared at it in that way he has--you know?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Mildred.  She was seeing those uncanny, brilliant,\npenetrating eyes, in such startling contrast to the calm, lifeless\ncoloring and classic chiseling of features.\n\n\"And after a while he said, 'So, THAT'S Miss Stevens!'  And I asked him\nwhat he meant, and he took one of your later photos and put the two\nside by side. To my notion the later was a lot the more attractive, for\nthe face was rounder and softer and didn't have a certain kind\nof--well, hardness, as if you had a will and could ride rough shod. Not\nthat you look so frightfully unattractive.\"\n\n\"I remember the picture,\" interrupted Mildred.  \"It was taken when I\nwas twenty--just after an illness.\"\n\n\"The face WAS thin,\" said Stanley.  \"Keith called it a 'give away.'\"\n\n\"I'd like to see it,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"I'll try to find it.  But I'm afraid I can't.  I haven't seen it since\nI showed it to Keith, and when I hunted for it the other day, it didn't\nturn up.  I've changed valets several times in the last six months--\"\n\nBut Mildred had ceased listening.  Keith had seen the picture, had\ncalled it a \"give away,\" had been interested in it--and the picture had\ndisappeared.  She laughed at her own folly, yet she was glad Stanley\nhad given her this chance to make up a silly day-dream. She waited\nuntil he had exhausted himself on the subject of valets, their\ndrunkenness, their thievish habits, their incompetence, then she said:\n\n\"I took my last lesson from Jennings to-day.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?  Do you want to change? You didn't say anything\nabout it?  Isn't he good?\"\n\n\"Good enough.  But I've discovered that my voice isn't reliable, and\nunless one has a reliable voice there's no chance for a grand-opera\ncareer--or for comic opera, either.\"\n\nStanley was straightway all agitation and protest. \"Who put that notion\nin your head?  There's nothing in it, Mildred.  Jennings is crazy about\nyour voice, and he knows.\"\n\n\"Jennings is after the money,\" replied Mildred. \"What I'm saying is the\ntruth.  Stanley, our beautiful dream of a career has winked out.\"\n\nHis expression was most revealing.\n\n\"And,\" she went on, \"I'm not going to take any more of your money--and,\nof course, I'll pay back what I've borrowed when I can\"--she\nsmiled--\"which may not be very soon.\"\n\n\"What's all this about, anyhow?\" demanded he.  \"I don't see any sign of\nit in your face.  You wouldn't take it so coolly if it were so.\"\n\n\"I don't understand why I'm not wringing my hands and weeping,\" replied\nshe.  \"Every few minutes I tell myself that I ought to be.  But I stay\nquite calm.  I suppose I'm--sort of stupefied.\"\n\n\"Do you really mean that you've given up?\" cried he.\n\n\"It's no use to waste the money, Stanley.  I've got the voice, and\nthat's what deceived us all.  But there's nothing BEHIND the voice.\nWith a great singer the greatness is in what's behind the voice, not in\nthe voice itself.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" cried he violently. \"You've been\ndiscouraged by a little cold.  Everybody has colds.  Why, in this\nclimate the colds are always getting the Metropolitan singers down.\"\n\n\"But they've got strong throats, and my throat's delicate.\"\n\n\"You must go to a better climate.  You ought to be abroad, anyhow. That\nwas part of my plan--for us to go abroad--\"  He stopped in confusion,\nreddened, went bravely on--\"and you to study there and make your debut.\"\n\nMildred shook her head.  \"That's all over,\" said she. \"I've got to\nchange my plans entirely.\"\n\n\"You're a little depressed, that's all.  For a minute you almost\nconvinced me.  What a turn you did give me!  I forgot how your voice\nsounded the last time I heard it.  No, you'd not be so calm, if you\ndidn't know everything was all right.\"\n\nHer eyes lit up with sly humor.  \"Perhaps I'm calm because I feel that\nmy future's secure as your wife. What more could a woman ask?\"\n\nHe forced an uncomfortable laugh.  \"Of course--of course,\" he said with\na painful effort to be easy and jocose.\n\n\"I knew you'd marry me, even if I couldn't sing a note.  I knew your\nbelief in my career had nothing to do with it.\"\n\nHe hesitated, blurted out the truth.  \"Speaking seriously, that isn't\nquite so,\" said he.  \"I've got my heart set on your making a great\ntear--and I know you'll do it.\"\n\n\"And if you knew I wouldn't, you'd not want to marry me?\"\n\n\"I don't say that,\" protested he.  \"How can I say how I'd feel if you\nwere different?\"\n\nShe nodded.  \"That's sensible, and it's candid,\" she said.  She laid\nher hand impulsively on his arm.  \"I DO like you, Stanley.  You have\ngot such a lot of good qualities.  Don't worry.  I'm not going to\ninsist on your marrying me.\"\n\n\"You don't have to do that, Mildred,\" said he. \"I'm staring, raving\ncrazy about you, though I'm a damn fool to let you know it.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is foolish,\" said she.  \"If you'd kept me worrying--  Still, I\nguess not.  But it doesn't matter. You can protest and urge all you\nplease, quite safely. I'm not going to marry you.  Now let's talk\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Let's talk marriage,\" said he.  \"I want this thing settled.  You know\nyou intend to marry me, Mildred. Why not say so?  Why keep me gasping\non the hook?\"\n\nThey heard the front door open, and the rustling of skirts down the\nhall.  Mildred called:\n\n\"Mrs. Brindley!  Cyrilla!\"\n\nAn instant and Cyrilla appeared in the doorway. When she and Baird had\nshaken hands, Mildred said:\n\n\"Cyrilla, I want you to tell the exact, honest truth. Is there any hope\nfor a woman with a delicate throat to make a grand-opera career?\"\n\nCyrilla paled, looked pleadingly at Mildred.\n\n\"Tell him,\" commanded Mildred.\n\n\"Very little,\" said Mrs. Brindley.  \"But--\"\n\n\"Don't try to soften it,\" interrupted Mildred. \"The truth, the plain\ntruth.\"\n\n\"You've no right to draw me into this,\" cried Cyrilla indignantly, and\nshe started to leave the room.\n\n\"I want him to know,\" said Mildred.  \"And he wants to know.\"\n\n\"I refuse to be drawn into it,\" Cyrilla said, and disappeared.\n\nBut Mildred saw that Stanley had been shaken.  She proceeded to explain\nto him at length what a singer's career meant--the hardships, the\ndrafts on health and strength, the absolute necessity of being\nreliable, of singing true, of not disappointing audiences--what a\ndelicate throat meant--how delicate her throat was--how deficient she\nwas in the kind of physical strength needed--muscular power with\nendurance back of it. When she finished he understood.\n\n\"I'd always thought of it as an art,\" he said ruefully.  \"Why, it's\nmostly health and muscles and things that have nothing to do with\nmusic.\"  He was dazed and offended by this uncovering of the mechanism\nof the art--by the discovery of the coarse and painful toil, the\ngrossly physical basis, of what had seemed to him all idealism.  He had\nbeen full of the delusions of spontaneity and inspiration, like all\nlaymen, and all artists, too, except those of the higher ranks--those\nwho have fought their way up to the heights and, so, have learned that\none does not achieve them by being caught up to them gloriously in a\nfiery cloud, but by doggedly and dirtily and sweatily toiling over\nevery inch of the cruel climb.\n\nHe sat silent when she had finished.  She waited, then said:\n\n\"Now, you see.  I release you, and I'll take no more money to waste.\"\n\nHe looked at her with dumb misery that smote her heart.  Then his\nexpression changed--to the shining, hungry eyes, the swollen veins, the\nreddened countenance, the watering lips of desire.  He seized her in\nhis arms, and in a voice trembling with passion, he cried: \"You must\nmarry me, anyhow!  I've GOT to have you, Mildred.\"\n\nIf she had loved him, his expression, his impassioned voice would have\nthrilled her.  But she did not love him. It took all her liking for\nhim, and the memory of all she owed him--that unpaid debt!--to enable\nher to push him away gently and to say without any show of the\nrepulsion she felt:\n\n\"Stanley, you mustn't do that.  And it's useless to talk of marriage.\nYou're generous, so you are taking pity on me.  But believe me, I'll\nget along somehow.\"\n\n\"Pity?  I tell you I love you,\" he cried, catching desperately at her\nhands and holding them in a grip she could not break.  \"You've no right\nto treat me like this.\"\n\nIt was one of those veiled and stealthy reminders of obligation\nhabitually indulged in by delicate people seeking repayment of the\ndebt, but shunning the coarseness of direct demand.  Mildred saw her\nopportunity. Said she quietly:\n\n\"You mean you want me to give myself to you in payment, or part\npayment, for the money you've loaned me?\"\n\nHe released her hands and sprang up.  He had meant just that, but he\nhad not had the courage, or the meanness, or both, to admit boldly his\nown secret wish. She had calculated on this--had calculated well.\n\"Mildred!\" he cried in a shocked voice.  \"YOU so lacking in delicacy as\nto say such a thing!\"\n\n\"If you didn't mean that, Stanley, what DID you mean?\"\n\n\"I was appealing to our friendship--our--our love for each other.\"\n\n\"Then you should have waited until I was free.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" he cried, \"don't you see that's hopeless?  Mildred, be\nsensible--be merciful.\"\n\n\"I shall never marry a man when he could justly suspect I did it to\nlive off him.\"\n\n\"What an idea!  It's a man's place to support a woman!\"\n\n\"I was speaking only of myself.  _I_ can't do it. And it's absurd for\nyou and me to be talking about love and marriage when anyone can see\nI'd be marrying you only because I was afraid to face poverty and a\nstruggle.\"\n\nHer manner calmed him somewhat.  \"Of course it's obvious that you've\ngot to have money,\" said he, \"and that the only way you can get it is\nby marriage.  But there's something else, too, and in my opinion it's\nthe principal thing--we care for each other.  Why not be sensible,\nMildred?  Why not thank God that as long as you have to marry, you can\nmarry someone you care for.\"\n\n\"Could you feel that I cared for you, if I married you now?\" inquired\nshe.\n\n\"Why not?  I'm not so entirely lacking in self-esteem.  I feel that I\nmust count for something.\"\n\nMildred sat silently wondering at this phenomenon so astounding, yet a\ncommonplace of masculine egotism. She had no conception of this vanity\nwhich causes the man, at whom the street woman smiles, to feel\nflattered, though he knows full well what she is and her dire\nnecessity.  She could not doubt that he was speaking the truth, yet she\ncould not believe that conceit could so befog common sense in a man\nwho, for all his slowness and shallowness, was more than ordinarily\nshrewd.\n\n\"Even if I thought I loved you,\" said she, \"I couldn't be sure in these\ncircumstances that I wasn't after your money.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" replied he.  \"I understand you better than\nyou understand yourself.\"\n\n\"Let's stop talking about it,\" said she impatiently. \"I want to explain\nto you the business side of this.\" She took her purse from the table.\n\"Here are the papers.\"  She handed him a check and a note.  \"I made\nthem out at the bank this morning.  The note is for what I owe you--and\ndraws interest at four per cent.  The check is for all the money I have\nleft except about four hundred dollars.  I've some bills I must pay,\nand also I didn't dare quite strip myself.  The note may not be worth\nthe paper it's written on, but I hope--\"\n\nBefore she could prevent him he took the two papers, and, holding them\nout of her reach, tore them to bits.\n\nHer eyes gleamed angrily.  \"I see you despise me--as much as I've\ninvited.  But, I'll make them out again and mail them to you.\"\n\n\"You're a silly child,\" said he gruffly.  \"We're going to be married.\"\n\nShe eyed him with amused exasperation.  \"It's too absurd!\" she cried.\n\"And if I yielded, you'd be trying to get out of it.\"  She hesitated\nwhether to tell him frankly just how she felt toward him.  She decided\nagainst it, not through consideration--for a woman feels no\nconsideration for a man she does not love, if he has irritated her--but\nthrough being ashamed to say harsh things to one whom she owed so much.\n\"It's useless for you to pretend and to plead,\" she went on.  \"I shall\nnot yield.  You'll have to wait until I'm free and independent.\"\n\n\"You'll marry me then?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied she, laughing.  \"But I'll be able to refuse you in such a\nway that you'll believe.\"\n\n\"But you've got to marry, Mildred, and right away.\" A suspicion entered\nhis mind and instantly gleamed in his eyes.  \"Are you in love with\nsomeone else?\"\n\nShe smiled mockingly.\n\n\"It looks as if you were,\" he went on, arguing with himself aloud. \"For\nif you weren't you'd marry me, even though you didn't like me.  A woman\nin your fix simply couldn't keep herself from it.  Is THAT why you're\nso calm?\"\n\n\"I'm not marrying anybody,\" said she.\n\n\"Then what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"You'll see.\"\n\nOnce more the passionate side of his nature showed--not merely\ngrotesque, unattractive, repellent, as in the mood of longing, but\nhideous.  Among men Stanley Baird passed for a man of rather arrogant\nand violent temper, but that man who had seen him at his most violent\nwould have been amazed.  The temper men show toward men bears small\nresemblance either in kind or in degree to the temper of jealous\npassion they show toward the woman who baffles them or arouses their\nsuspicions; and no man would recognize his most intimate man friend--or\nhimself--when in that paroxysm. Mildred had seen this mood, gleaming at\nher through a mask, in General Siddall.  It had made her sick with fear\nand repulsion.  In Stanley Baird it first astounded her, then filled\nher with hate.\n\n\"Stanley!\" she gasped.\n\n\"WHO is it?\" he ground out between his teeth. And he seized her\nsavagely.\n\n\"If you don't release me at once,\" said she calmly, \"I shall call Mrs.\nBrindley, and have you put out of the house.  No matter if I do owe you\nall that money.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" he cried, releasing her.  \"You're very clever, aren't\nyou?--turning that against me and making me powerless.\"\n\n\"But for that, would you dare presume to touch me, to question me?\"\nsaid she.\n\nHe lowered his gaze, stood panting with the effort to subdue his fury.\n\nShe went back to her own room.  A few hours later came a letter of\napology from him.  She answered it friendlily, said she would let him\nknow when she could see him again, and enclosed a note and a check.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nMILDRED went to bed that night proud of her strength of character. Were\nthere many women--was there any other woman she knew or knew about--who\nin her desperate circumstances would have done what she had done?  She\ncould have married a man who would have given her wealth and the very\nbest social position.  She had refused him.  She could have continued\nto \"borrow\" from him the wherewithal to keep her in luxurious comfort\nwhile she looked about at her ease for a position that meant\nindependence. She had thrust the temptation from her.  All this from\npurely high-minded motives; for other motive there could be none.  She\nwent to sleep, confident that on the morrow she would continue to tread\nthe path of self-respect with unfaltering feet.  But when morning came\nher throat was once more slightly off--enough to make it wise to\npostpone the excursion in search of a trial for musical comedy.  The\nexcitement or the reaction from excitement--it must be the one or the\nother--had resulted in weakness showing itself, naturally, at her\nweakest point--that delicate throat.  When life was calm and orderly,\nand her mind was at peace, the trouble would pass, and she could get a\nposition of some kind.  Not the career she had dreamed; that was\nimpossible.  But she had voice enough for a little part, where a living\ncould be made; and perhaps she would presently fathom the secret of the\ncause of her delicate throat and would be able to go far--possibly as\nfar as she had dreamed.\n\nThe delay of a few days was irritating.  She would have preferred to\npush straight on, while her courage was taut.  Still, the delay had one\nadvantage--she could prepare the details of her plan.  So, instead of\ngoing to the office of the theatrical manager--Crossley, the most\nsuccessful producer of light, musical pieces of all kinds--she went to\ncall on several of the girls she knew who were more or less in touch\nwith matters theatrical.  And she found out just how to proceed toward\naccomplishing a purpose which ought not to be difficult for one with\nsuch a voice as hers and with physical charms peculiarly fitted for\nstage exhibition.\n\nNot until Saturday was her voice at its best again. She, naturally,\ndecided not to go to the theatrical office on Monday, but to wait until\nshe had seen and talked with Keith.  One more day did not matter, and\nKeith might be stimulating, might even have some useful suggestions to\noffer.  She received him with a manner that was a version, and a most\ncharming version, of his own tranquil indifference.  But his first\nremark threw her into a panic.  Said he:\n\n\"I've only a few minutes.  No, thanks, I'll not sit.\"\n\n\"You needn't have bothered to come,\" said she coldly.\n\n\"I always keep my engagements.  Baird tells me you have given up the\narrangement you had with him. You'll probably be moving from here, as\nyou'll not have the money to stay on.  Send me your new address,\nplease.\"  He took a paper from his pocket and gave it to her.  \"You\nwill find this useful--if you are in earnest,\" said he.  \"Good-by, and\ngood luck.  I'll hope to see you in a few weeks.\"\n\nBefore she had recovered herself in the least, she was standing there\nalone, the paper in her hand, her stupefied gaze upon the door through\nwhich he had disappeared. All his movements and his speech had been of\nhis customary, his invariable, deliberateness; but she had the\nimpression of whirling and rushing haste. With a long gasping sigh she\nfell to trembling all over. She sped to her room, got its door safely\nclosed just in time.  Down she sank upon the bed, to give way to an\nattack of hysterics.\n\nWe are constantly finding ourselves putting forth the lovely flowers\nand fruit of the virtues whereof the heroes and heroines of romance are\nso prolific.  Usually nothing occurs to disillusion us about ourselves.\nBut now and then fate, in unusually brutal ironic mood, forces us to\nsee the real reason why we did this or that virtuous, self-sacrificing\naction, or blossomed forth in this or that nobility of character.\nMildred was destined now to suffer one of these savage blows of\ndisillusionment about self that thrust us down from the exalted moral\nheights where we have been preening into humble kinship with the weak\nand frail human race.  She saw why she had refused Stanley, why she had\nstopped \"borrowing,\" why she had put off going to the theatrical\nmanagers, why she had delayed moving into quarters within her\ndiminished and rapidly diminishing means.  She had been counting on\nDonald Keith.  She had convinced herself that he loved her even as she\nloved him.  He would fling away his cold reserve, would burst into\nraptures over her virtue and her courage, would ask her to marry him.\nOr, if he should put off that, he would at least undertake the\nresponsibility of getting her started in her career.  Well!  He had\ncome; he had shown that Stanley had told him all or practically all;\nand he had gone, without asking a sympathetic question or making an\nencouraging remark.  As indifferent as he seemed.  Burnt out, cold,\nheartless. She had leaned upon him; he had slipped away, leaving her to\nfall painfully, and ludicrously, to the ground. She had been boasting\nto herself that she was strong, that she would of her own strength\nestablish herself in independence.  She had not dreamed that she would\nbe called upon to \"make good.\"  She raved against Keith, against\nherself, against fate.  And above the chaos and the wreck within her,\nround and round, hither and yon, flapped and shied the black thought,\n\"What SHALL I do?\"\n\nWhen she sat up and dried her eyes, she chanced to see the paper Keith\nhad left; with wonder at her having forgotten it and with a throb of\nhope she opened and began to read his small, difficult writing:\n\n\nA career means self-denial.  Not occasional, intermittent, but steady,\nconstant, daily, hourly--a purpose that never relaxes.\n\nA career as a singer means not only the routine, the patient tedious\nwork, the cutting out of time-wasting people and time-wasting pleasures\nthat are necessary to any and all careers.  It means in addition--for\nsuch a person--sacrifices far beyond a character so undisciplined and\nso corrupted by conventional life as is yours.  The basis of a singing\ncareer is health and strength.  You must have great physical strength\nto be able to sing operas.  You must have perfect health.\n\nDiet and exercise.  A routine life, its routine rigidly adhered to, day\nin and day out, month after month, year after year.  Small and\nuninteresting and monotonous food, nothing to drink, and, of course, no\ncigarettes.  Such is the secret of a reliable voice for you who have a\n\"delicate throat\"--which is the silly, shallow, and misleading way of\nsaying a delicate digestion, for sore throat always means indigestion,\nnever means anything else.  To sing, the instrument, the absolutely\nmaterial machine, must be in perfect order.  The rest is easy.\n\nSome singers can commit indiscretions of diet and of lack of exercise.\nBut not you, because you lack this natural strength.  Do not be\ndeceived and misled by their example.\n\nExercise.  You must make your body strong, powerful. You have not the\nmuscles by nature.  You must acquire them.\n\nThe following routine of diet and exercise made one of the great\nsingers, and kept her great for a quarter of a century. If you adopt\nit, without variation, you can make a career. If you do not, you need\nnot hope for anything but failure and humiliation.  Within my knowledge\nsixty-eight young men and young women have started in on this system.\nNot one had the character to persist to success.  This may suggest why,\nexcept two who are at the very top, all of the great singers are men\nand women whom nature has made powerful of body and of digestion--so\npowerful that their indiscretions only occasionally make them\nunreliable.\n\n\nThere Mildred stopped and flung the paper aside. She did not care even\nto glance at the exercises prescribed or at the diet and the routine of\ndaily work. How dull and uninspired!  How grossly material! Stomach!\nChewing!  Exercising machines!  Plodding dreary miles daily, rain or\nshine!  What could such things have to do with the free and glorious\ncareer of an inspired singer?  Keith was laughing at her as he hastened\naway, abandoning her to her fate.\n\nShe examined herself in the glass to make sure that the ravages of her\nattack of rage and grief and despair could be effaced within a few\nhours, then she wrote a note--formal yet friendly--to Stanley Baird,\ninforming him that she would receive him that evening.  He came while\nCyrilla and Mildred were having their after, dinner coffee and\ncigarettes.  He was a man who took great pains with his clothes, and\ngot them where pains was not in vain.  That evening he had arrayed\nhimself with unusual care, and the result was a fine, manly figure of\nthe well-bred New-Yorker type.  Certainly Stanley had ground for his\nfeeling that he deserved and got liking for himself.  The three sat in\nthe library for perhaps half an hour, then Mrs. Brindley rose to leave\nthe other two alone.  Mildred urged her to stay--Mildred who had been\nimpatient of her presence when Stanley was announced.  Urged her to\nstay in such a tone that Cyrilla could not persist, but had to sit down\nagain. As the three talked on and on, Mildred continued to picture life\nwith Stanley--continued the vivid picturing she had begun within ten\nminutes of Stanley's entering, the picturing that had caused her to\ninsist on Cyrilla's remaining as chaperon.  A young girl can do no such\npicturing as Mildred could not avoid doing.  To the young girl married\nlife, its tete-a-tetes, its intimacies, its routine, are all a blank.\nAny attempt she makes to fill in details goes far astray.  But Mildred,\nwith Stanley there before her, could see her life as it would be.\n\nToward half-past ten, Stanley said, shame-faced and pleading, \"Mildred,\nI should like to see you alone for just a minute before I go.\"\n\nMildred said to Cyrilla:  \"No, don't move.  We'll go into the\ndrawing-room.\"\n\nHe followed her there, and when the sound of Mrs. Brindley's step in\nthe hall had died away, he began: \"I think I understand you a little\nnow.  I shan't insult you by returning or destroying that note or the\ncheck.  I accept your decision--unless you wish to change it.\"  He\nlooked at her with eager appeal.  His heart was trembling, was sick\nwith apprehension, with the sense of weakness, of danger and gloom\nahead. \"Why shouldn't I help you, at least, Mildred?\" he urged.\n\nWhence the courage came she knew not, but through her choking throat\nshe forced a positive, \"No.\"\n\n\"And,\" he went on, \"I meant what I said.  I love you.  I'm wretched\nwithout you.  I want you to marry me, career or no career.\"\n\nHer fears were clamorous, but she forced herself to say, \"I can't\nchange.\"\n\n\"I hoped--a little--that you sent me the note to-day because you--  You\ndidn't?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mildred.  \"I want us to be friends. But you must keep away.\"\n\nHe bent his head.  \"Then I'll go 'way off somewhere. I can't bear being\nhere in New York and not seeing you.  And when I've been away a year or\nso, perhaps I'll get control of myself again.\"\n\nGoing away!--to try to forget!--no doubt, to succeed in forgetting!\nThen this was her last chance.\n\n\"Must I go, Mildred?  Won't you relent?\"\n\n\"I don't love you--and I never can.\"  She was deathly white and\ntrembling.  She lifted her eyes to begin a retreat, for her courage had\nquite oozed away. He was looking at her, his face distorted with a\nmingling of the passion of desire and the passion of jealousy. She\nshrank, caught at the back of a chair for support, felt suddenly strong\nand defiant.  To be this man's plaything, to submit to his moods, to\nhis jealousies, to his caprices--to be his to fumble and caress, his to\nhave the fury of his passion wreak itself upon her with no response\nfrom her but only repulsion and loathing--and the long dreary hours and\ndays and years alone with him, listening to his commonplaces, often so\ntedious, forced to try to amuse him and to keep him in a good humor\nbecause he held the purse-strings--\n\n\"Please go,\" she said.\n\nShe was still very young, still had years and years of youth unspent.\nSurely she could find something better than this.  Surely life must\nmean something more than this.  At least it was worth a trial.\n\nHe held out his hand.  She gave him her reluctant and cold fingers.  He\nsaid something, what she did not hear, for the blood was roaring in her\nears as the room swam round.  He was gone, and the next thing she\ndefinitely knew she was at the threshold of Cyrilla's room.  Cyrilla\ngave her a tenderly sympathetic glance. She saw herself in a mirror and\nknew why; her face was gray and drawn, and her eyes lay dully deep\nwithin dark circles.\n\n\"I couldn't do it,\" she said.  \"I sent for him to marry him.  But I\ncouldn't.\"\n\n\"I'm glad,\" said Cyrilla.  \"Marriage without love is a last resort. And\nyou're a long way from last resorts.\"\n\n\"You don't think I'm crazy?\"\n\n\"I think you've won a great victory.\"\n\n\"Victory!\"  And Mildred laughed dolefully.  \"If this is victory, I hope\nI'll never know defeat.\"\n\nWhy did Mildred refuse Stanley Baird and cut herself off from him, even\nafter her hopes of Donald Keith died through lack of food, real or\nimaginary?  It would be gratifying to offer this as a case of pure\ncourage and high principle, untainted of the motives which govern\nordinary human actions.  But unluckily this is a biography, not a\nromance, a history and not a eulogy. And Mildred Gower is a human\nbeing, even as you and I, not a galvanized embodiment of superhuman\nvirtues such as you and I are pretending to be, perhaps even to\nourselves.  The explanation of her strange aberration, which will be\ndoubted or secretly condemned by every woman of the sheltered classes\nwho loves her dependence and seeks to disguise it as something sweet\nand fine and \"womanly\"--the explanation of her almost insane act of\nrenunciation of all that a lady holds most dear is simple enough,\npuzzling though she found it.  Ignorance, which accounts for so much of\nthe squalid failure in human life, accounts also for much if not all\nthe most splendid audacious achievement.  Very often--very, very\noften--the impossibilities are achieved by those who in their ignorance\nadvance not boldly but unconcernedly where a wiser man or woman would\nshrink and retreat.  Fortunate indeed is he or she who in a crisis is\nby chance equipped with neither too little nor too much knowledge--who\nknows enough to enable him to advance, but does not know enough to\nappreciate how perilous, how foolhardy, how harsh and cruel, advance\nwill be.  Mildred was in this instance thus fortunate--unfortunate, she\nwas presently to think it. She knew enough about loveless marriage to\nshrink from it.  She did not know enough about what poverty,\nmoneylessness, and friendlessness mean in the actuality to a woman bred\nas she had been.  She imagined she knew--and sick at heart her notion\nof poverty made her.  But imagination was only faintest foreshadowing\nof actuality.  If she had known, she would have yielded to the\ntemptation that was almost too strong for her.  And if she had\nyielded--what then? Not such a repulsive lot, as our comfortable\nclasses look at it.  Plenty to eat and drink and to wear, servants and\nequipages and fine houses and fine society, the envy of her gaping\nkind--a comfortable life for the body, a comfortable death for mind and\nheart, slowly and softly suffocated in luxury.  Partly through\nknowledge that strongly affected her character, which was on the whole\naspiring and sensitive beyond the average to the true and the\nbeautiful, partly through ignorance that veiled the future from her\nnone too valorous and hardy heart, she did not yield to the temptation.\nAnd thus, instead of dying, she began to live, for what is life but\ngrowth in experience, in strength and knowledge and capability?\n\nA baby enters the world screaming with pain.  The first sensations of\nliving are agonizing.  It is the same with the birth of souls, for a\nsoul is not really born until that day when it is offered choice\nbetween life and death and chooses life.  In Mildred Gower's case this\nbirth was an agony.  She awoke the following morning with a dull\nheadache, a fainting heart, and a throat so sore that she felt a\npainful catch whenever she tried to swallow.  She used the spray; she\nmassaged her throat and neck vigorously.  In vain; it was folly to\nthink of going where she might have to risk a trial of her voice that\nday.  The sun was brilliant and the air sharp without being humid or\ntoo cold.  She dressed, breakfasted, went out for a walk.  The throat\ngrew worse, then better.  She returned for luncheon, and afterward\nbegan to think of packing, not that she had chosen a new place, but\nbecause she wished to have some sort of a sense of action.  But her\nunhappiness drove her out again--to the park where the air was fine and\nshe could walk in comparative solitude.\n\n\"What a silly fool I am!\" thought she.  \"Why did I do this in the\nworst, the hardest possible way?  I should have held on to Stanley\nuntil I had a position. No, I'm such a poor creature that I could never\nhave done it in that way.  I'd simply have kept on bluffing, fooling\nmyself, putting off and putting of.  I had to jump into the water with\nnobody near to help me, or I'd never have begun to learn to swim.  I\nhaven't begun yet.  I may never learn to swim.  I may drown. Yes, I\nprobably shall drown.\"\n\nShe wandered aimlessly on--around the upper reservoir where the strong\nbreeze freshened her through and through and made her feel less forlorn\nin spite of her chicken heart.  She crossed the bridge at the lower end\nand came down toward the East Drive.  A taxicab rushed by, not so fast,\nhowever, that she failed to recognize Donald Keith and Cyrilla\nBrindley.  They were talking so earnestly--Keith was talking, for a\nwonder, and Mrs. Brindley listening--that they did not see her.  She\nwent straight home.  But as she was afoot, the journey took about half\nan hour.  Cyrilla was already there, in a negligee, looking as if she\nhad not been out of the little library for hours.  She was writing a\nletter.  Mildred strolled in and seated herself. Cyrilla went on\nwriting.  Mildred watched her impatiently.  She wished to talk, to be\ntalked to, to be consoled and cheered, to hear about Donald Keith.\nWould that letter never be finished?  At last it was, and Cyrilla took\na book and settled herself to reading.  There was a vague something in\nher manner--a change, an attitude toward Mildred--that disturbed\nMildred.  Or, was that notion of a change merely the offspring of her\nown somber mood?  Seeing that Mrs. Brindley would not begin, she broke\nthe silence herself.  Said she awkwardly:\n\n\"I've decided to move.  In fact, I've got to move.\"\n\nCyrilla laid down the book and regarded her tranquilly.  \"Of course,\"\nsaid she.  \"I've already begun to arrange for someone else.\"\n\nMildred choked, and the tears welled into her eyes. She had not been\nmistaken; Cyrilla had changed toward her.  Now that she had no\nprospects for a brilliant career, now that her money was gone, Cyrilla\nhad begun to--to be human.  No doubt, in the course of that drive,\nCyrilla had discovered that Keith had no interest in her either.\nMildred beat down her emotion and was soon able to say in a voice as\nunconcerned as Cyrilla's:\n\n\"I'll find a place to-morrow or next day, and go at once.\"\n\n\"I'll be sorry to lose you,\" said Mrs. Brindley, \"but I agree with you\nthat you can't get settled any too soon.\"\n\n\"You don't happen to know of any cheap, good place?\" said Mildred.\n\n\"If it's cheap, I don't think it's likely to be good--in New York,\"\nreplied Cyrilla.  \"You'll have to put up with inconveniences--and\nworse.  I'd offer to help you find a place, but I think everything\nself-reliant one does helps one to learn.  Don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" assented Mildred.  The thing was self-evidently true;\nstill she began to hate Cyrilla. This cold-hearted New York!  How she\nwould grind down her heel when she got it on the neck of New York!\nFriendship, love, helpfulness--what did New York and New-Yorkers know\nof these things?  \"Or Hanging Rock, either,\" reflected she.  What a\ncold and lonely world!\n\n\"Have you been to see about a position?\" inquired Cyrilla.\n\nMildred was thrown into confusion.  \"I can't go--for a--day or so,\" she\nstammered.  \"The changeable weather has rather upset my throat. Nothing\nserious, but I want to be at my best.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Brindley.  Her direct gaze made Mildred\nuncomfortable.  She went on:  \"You're sure it's the weather?\"\n\n\"What else could it be?\" demanded Mildred with a latent resentment\nwhose interesting origin she did not pause to inquire into.\n\n\"Well, salad, or sauces, or desserts, or cafe au lait in the morning,\nor candy, or tea,\" said Cyrilla.  \"Or it might be cigarettes, or all\nthose things--and thin stockings and low shoes--mightn't it?\"\n\nNever before had she known Cyrilla to say anything meddlesome or\ncattish.  Said Mildred with a faint sneer, \"That sounds like Mr.\nKeith's crankiness.\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied Cyrilla.  \"I used to think he was a crank on the\nsubject of singing and stomachs, and singing and ankles.  But I've been\nconvinced, partly by him, mostly by what I've observed.\"\n\nMildred maintained an icy silence.\n\n\"I see you are resenting what I said,\" observed Cyrilla.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Mildred.  \"No doubt you meant well.\"\n\n\"You will please remember that you asked me a question.\"\n\nSo she had.  But the discovery that she was clearly in the wrong, that\nshe had invited the disguised lecture, only aggravated her sense of\nresentment against Mrs. Brindley.  She spent the rest of the afternoon\nin sorting and packing her belongings--and in crying.  She came upon\nthe paper Donald Keith had left.  She read it through carefully,\nthoughtfully, read it to the last direction as to exercise with the\nmachine, the last arrangement for a daily routine of life, the last\nsuggestion as to diet.\n\n\"Fortunately all that isn't necessary,\" said she to herself, when she\nhad finished.  \"If it were, I could never make a career.  I'm not\nstupid enough to be able to lead that kind of life.  Why, I'd not care\nto make a career, at that price.  Slavery--plain slavery.\"\n\nWhen she went in to dinner, she saw instantly that Cyrilla too had been\ncrying.  Cyrilla did not look old, anything but that, indeed was not\nold and would not begin to be for many a year.  Still, after\nthirty-five or forty a woman cannot indulge a good cry without its\nleaving serious traces that will show hours afterward. At sight of the\nevidences of Cyrilla's grief Mildred straightway forgot her resentment.\nThere must have been some other cause for Cyrilla's peculiar conduct.\nNo matter what, since it was not hardness of heart.\n\nIt was a sad, even a gloomy dinner.  But the two women were once more\nin perfect sympathy.  And afterward Mildred brought the Keith paper and\nasked Cyrilla's opinion.  Cyrilla read slowly and without comment.  At\nlast she said:\n\n\"He got this from his mother, Lucia Rivi.  Have you read her life?\"\n\n\"No.  I've heard almost nothing about her, except that she was famous.\"\n\n\"She was more than that,\" said Mrs. Brindley. \"She was great, a great\npersonality.  She was an almost sickly child and girl.  Her first\nattempts on the stage were humiliating failures.  She had no health, no\nendurance, nothing but a small voice of rare quality.\" Cyrilla held up\nthe paper.  \"This tells how she became one of the surest and most\npowerful dramatic sopranos that ever lived.\"\n\n\"She must have been a dull person to have been able to lead the kind of\nlife that's described there,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Only two kinds of persons could do it,\" replied Cyrilla--\"a dull\nperson--a plodder--and a genius. Middling people--they're the kind that\nfill the world, they're you and I, my dear--middling people have to\nfuss with the trifles that must be sacrificed if one is to do anything\nbig.  You call those trifles your freedom, but they're your slavery.\nAnd by sacrificing them the Lucia Rivis buy their freedom.\"  Cyrilla\nlooked at the paper with a heavy sigh.  \"Ah, I wish I had seen this\nwhen I was your age.  Now, it's too late.\"\n\nSaid Mildred:  \"Would you seriously advise me to try that?\"\n\nCyrilla came and sat beside her and put an arm around her.  \"Mildred,\"\nshe said, \"I've never thrust advice on you.  I only dare do it now\nbecause you ask me, and because I love you.  You must try it.  It's\nyour one chance.  If you do not, you will fail.  You don't believe me?\"\n\nIn a tone that was admission, Mildred said:  \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Keith has given you there the secret of a successful career.  You'll\nnever read it in any book, or get it from any teacher, or from any\nsinger or manager or doctor.  You must live like that, you must do\nthose things or you will fail even in musical comedy.  You would fail\neven as an actress, if you tried that, when you found out that the\nsinging was out of the question.\"\n\nMildred was impressed.  Perhaps she would have been more impressed had\nshe not seen Keith and Mrs. Brindley in the taxi, Keith talking\nearnestly and Mrs. Brindley listening as if to an oracle.  Said she:\n\"Perhaps I'll adopt some of the suggestions.\"\n\nCyrilla shook her head.  \"It's a route to success. You must go the\nwhole route or not at all.\"\n\n\"Don't forget that there have been other singers besides Rivi.\"\n\n\"Not any that I recall who weren't naturally powerful in every way. And\nhow many of them break down? Mildred, please do put the silly nonsense\nabout nerves and temperament and inspiration and overwork and weather\nand climate--put all that out of your head. Build your temple of a\ncareer as high and graceful and delicate as you like, but build it on\nthe coarse, hard, solid rock, dear!\"\n\nMildred tried to laugh lightly.  \"How Mr. Keith does hypnotize people!\"\ncried she.\n\nMrs. Brindley's cheeks burned, and her eyes lowered in acute\nembarrassment.  \"He has a way of being splendidly and sensibly right,\"\nsaid she.  \"And the truth is wonderfully convincing--once one sees it.\"\nShe changed the subject, and it did not come up--or, perhaps, come OUT\nagain--before they went to bed. The next day Mildred began the\ndepressing, hopeless search for a place to live that would be clean,\ncomfortable, and cheap.  Those three adjectives describe the ideal\nlodging; but it will be noted that all these are relative.  In fact,\nnone of the three means exactly the same thing to any two members of\nthe human family. Mildred's notion of clean--like her notion of\ncomfortable--on account of her bringing up implied a large element of\nluxury.  As for the word \"cheap,\" it really meant nothing at all to\nher.  From one standpoint everything seemed cheap; from another,\neverything seemed dear; that is, too dear for a young woman with less\nthan five hundred dollars in the world and no substantial prospect of\ngetting a single dollar more--unless by hook and crook, both of which\nmeans she was resolved not to employ.\n\nNever having earned so much as a single penny, the idea of anyone's\ngiving her anything for what she might be able to do was disturbingly\nvague and unreal. On the other hand, looking about her, she saw scores\nof men and women, personally known to her to be dull of conversation,\nand not well mannered or well dressed or well anything, who were making\nlivings without overwhelming difficulty.  Why not Mildred Gower?  In\nthis view the outlook was not discouraging.  \"I'll no doubt go through\nsome discomfort, getting myself placed.  But somewhere and somehow I\nshall be placed--and how I shall revenge myself on Donald Keith!\" His\nfascination for her had not been destroyed by his humiliating lack of\nbelief in her, nor by his cold-hearted desertion at just the critical\nmoment.  But his conduct had given her the incentive of rage, of stung\nvanity--or wounded pride, if you prefer.  She would get him back; she\nwould force him to admit; she would win him, if she could--and that\nought not to be difficult when she should be successful.  Having won\nhim, then--  What then?  Something superb in the way of revenge; she\nwould decide what, when the hour of triumph came. Meanwhile she must\nsearch for lodgings.\n\nIn her journeyings under the guidance of attractive advertisements and\n\"carefully selected\" agents' lists, she found herself in front of her\nfirst lodgings in New York--the house of Mrs. Belloc.  She had often\nthought of the New England school-teacher, arrived by such strange\npaths at such a strange position in New York.  She had started to call\non her many times, but each time had been turned aside; New York makes\nit more than difficult to find time to do anything that does not have\nto be done at a definite time and for a definite reason.  She was worn\nout with her futile trampings up and down streets, up and down stairs.\nUp the stone steps she went and rang the bell.\n\nYes, Mrs. Belloc was in, and would be glad to see her, if Miss Stevens\nwould wait in the drawing-room a few minutes.  She had not seated\nherself when down the stairs came the fresh, pleasantly countrified\nvoice of Mrs. Belloc, inviting her to ascend.  As Mildred started up,\nshe saw at the head of the stairs the frank and cheerful face of the\nlady herself.  She was holding together at the neck a thin silk wrapper\nwhose lines strongly suggested that it was the only garment she had on.\n\n\"Why should old friends stand on ceremony?\" said Mrs. Belloc.  \"Come\nright up.  I've been taking a bath.  My masseuse has just gone.\"  Mrs.\nBelloc enclosed her in a delightfully perfumed embrace, and they kissed\nwith enthusiasm.\n\n\"I AM glad to see you,\" said Mildred, feeling all at once a thrilling\nsense of at-homeness.  \"I didn't realize how glad I'd be till I saw\nyou.\"\n\n\"It'd be a pretty stiff sort that wouldn't feel at home with me,\"\nobserved Mrs. Belloc.  \"New York usually stiffens people up.  It's had\nthe opposite effect on me. Though I must say, I have learned to stiffen\nwith people I don't like--and I'll have to admit that I like fewer and\nfewer.  People don't wear well, do they?  What IS the matter with them?\nWhy can't they be natural and not make themselves into rubbishy, old\nscrap-bags full of fakes and pretenses?  You're looking at my hair.\"\n\nThey were in Mrs. Belloc's comfortable sitting-room now, and she was\nsmoking a cigarette and regarding Mildred with an expression of delight\nthat was most flattering.  Said Mildred:\n\n\"Your hair does look well.  It's thicker--isn't it?\"\n\n\"Think so?\" said Mrs. Belloc.  \"It ought to be, with all the time and\nmoney I've spent on it.  My, how New York does set a woman to repairing\nand fixing up. Nothing artificial goes here.  It mustn't be paint and\nplumpers and pads, but the real teeth.  Why, I've had four real teeth\nset in as if they were rooted--and my hips toned down.  You may\nremember what heavy legs I had--piano-legs.  Look at 'em now.\"  Mrs.\nBelloc drew the wrapper to her knee and exposed in a pale-blue silk\nstocking a thin and comely calf.\n\n\"You HAVE been busy!\" said Mildred.\n\n\"That's only a little part.  I started to tell you about the hair.  It\nwas getting gray--not in a nice, pretty way, all over, but in spots and\nstreaks.  Nothing else makes a woman look so ragged and dingy and old\nas spotted, streaky gray hair.  So I had the hair-woman touch it up.\nShe vows it won't make my face hard. That's the trouble with dyed or\ntouched hair, you know. But this is a new process.\"\n\n\"It's certainly a success,\" said Mildred.  And in fact it was, and\nthanks to it and the other improvements Mrs. Belloc was an attractive\nand even a pretty woman, years younger than when Mildred saw her.\n\n\"Yes, I think I've improved,\" said Mrs. Belloc. \"Nothing to scream\nabout--but worth while.  That's what we're alive for--to improve--isn't\nit?  I've no patience with people who slide back, or don't get\non--people who get less and less as they grow older.  The trouble with\nthem is they're vain, satisfied with themselves as they are, and lazy.\nMost women are too lazy to live.  They'll only fix up to catch a man.\"\n\nMildred had grown sober and thoughtful.\n\n\"To catch a man,\" continued Mrs. Belloc.  \"And not much even for that.\nI'll warrant YOU'RE getting on. Tell me about it.\"\n\n\"Tell me about yourself, first,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"WHY all this excitement about improving?\" And she smiled significantly.\n\n\"No, you'll have to guess again,\" said Mrs. Belloc. \"Not a man.  You\nremember, I used to be crazy about gay life in New York--going out, and\nmen, theaters, and lobster-palaces--everything I didn't get in my home\ntown, everything the city means to the jays. Well, I've gotten over all\nthat.  I'm improving, mind and body, just to keep myself interested in\nlife, to keep myself young and cheerful.  I'm interested in myself, in\nmy house and in woman's suffrage.  Not that the women are fit to vote.\nThey aren't, any more than the men.  But what MAKES people?  Why,\nresponsibility. That old scamp I married--he's dead.  And I've got the\nmoney, and everything's very comfortable with me. Just think, I didn't\nhave any luck till I was an old maid far gone.  I'm not telling my age.\nAll my life it had rained bad luck--pitchforks, tines down.  And why?\"\n\n\"Yes, why?\" said Mildred.  She did not understand how it was, but Mrs.\nBelloc seemed to be saying the exact things she needed to hear.\n\n\"I'll tell you why.  Because I didn't work.  Drudging along isn't work\nany more than dawdling along. Work means purpose, means head.  And my\nluck began just as anybody's does--when I rose up and got busy.  You\nmay say it wasn't very creditable, the way I began; but it was the best\n_I_ could do.  I know it isn't good morals, but I'm willing to bet that\nmany a man has laid the foundations of a big fine career by doing\nsomething that wasn't at all nice or right.  He had to do it, to 'get\nthrough.'  If he hadn't done it, he'd never have 'got through.' Anyhow,\nwhether that's so or not, everyone's got to make a fight to break into\nthe part of the world where living's really worth living. But I needn't\ntell YOU that.  You're doing it.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" replied Mildred.  \"I'm ashamed to say so, but I'm not.\nI've been bluffing--and wasting time.\"\n\n\"That's bad, that's bad,\" said Mrs. Belloc. \"Especially, as you've got\nit in you to get there.  What's been the trouble?  The wrong kind of\nassociations?\"\n\n\"Partly,\" said Mildred.\n\nMrs. Belloc, watching her interestedly, suddenly lighted up.  \"Why not\ncome back here to live?\" said she.  \"Now, please don't refuse till I\nexplain.  You remember what kind of people I had here?\"\n\nMildred smiled.  \"Rather--unconventional?\"\n\n\"That's polite.  Well, I've cleared 'em out.  Not that I minded their\nunconventionality; I liked it.  It was so different from the\nstraight-jackets and the hypocrisy I'd been living among and hating.\nBut I soon found out that--well, Miss Stevens, the average human being\nought to be pretty conventional in his morals of a certain kind.  If\nhe--or SHE--isn't, they begin to get unconventional in every way--about\npaying their bills, for instance, and about drinking.  I got sick and\ntired of those people.  So, I put 'em all out--made a sweep.  And now\nI've become quite as respectable as I care to be--or as is necessary.\nThe couples in the house are married, and they're nice people of good\nfamilies.  It was Mrs. Dyckman--she's got the whole second floor front,\nshe and her husband and the daughter--it was Mrs. Dyckman who\ninterested me in the suffrage movement.  You must hear her speak.  And\nthe daughter does well at it, too--and keeps a fashionable\nmillinery-shop--and she's only twenty-four.  Then there's Nora Blond.\"\n\n\"The actress?\"\n\n\"The actress.  She's the quietest, hardest-working person here.  She's\ngot the whole first floor front. Nobody ever comes to see her, except\non Sunday afternoon. She leads the queerest life.\"\n\n\"Tell me about that,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"I don't know much about it,\" confessed Mrs. Belloc.  \"She's regular as\na clock--does everything on time, and at the same time.  Two meals a\nday--one of them a dry little breakfast she gets herself.  Walks,\nfencing, athletics, study.\"\n\n\"What slavery!\"\n\n\"She's the happiest person I ever saw,\" retorted Mrs. Belloc.  \"Why,\nshe's got her work, her career.  You don't look at it right, Miss\nStevens.  You don't look happy.  What's the matter?  Isn't it because\nyou haven't been working right--because you've been doing these alleged\npleasant things that leave a bad taste in your mouth and weaken you?\nI'll bet, if you had been working hard, you'd not be unhappy now.\nBetter come here to live.\"\n\n\"Will you let me tell you about myself?\"\n\n\"Go right ahead.  May I ask questions, where I want to know more?  I do\nhate to get things halfway.\"\n\nMildred freely gave her leave, then proceeded to tell her whole story,\nomitting nothing that was essential to an understanding.  In conclusion\nshe said:  \"I'd like to come.  You see, I've very little money.  When\nit's gone, I'll go, unless I make some more.\"\n\n\"Yes, you must come.  That Mrs. Brindley seems to be a nice woman, a\nmighty nice woman.  But her house, and the people that come there--they\naren't the right sort for a girl that's making a start.  I can give you\na room on the top floor--in front.  The young lady next to you is a\nclerk in an architect's office, and a fine girl she is.\"\n\n\"How much does she pay?\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Your room won't be quite as nice as hers.  I put you at the top\nbecause you can sing up there, part of the mornings and part of the\nafternoons, without disturbing anybody.  I don't have a general table\nany more.  You can take your meals in your room or at the restaurant in\nthe apartment-house next door.  It's good and quite reasonable.\"\n\n\"How much for the room?\" persisted Mildred, laughing.\n\n\"Seven dollars a week, and the use of the bath.\"\n\nMildred finally wrung from her that the right price was twelve dollars\na week, and insisted on paying that--\"until my money gets low.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" said Mrs. Belloc.\n\n\"You mustn't weaken me,\" cried Mildred.  \"You mustn't encourage me to\nbe a coward and to shirk. That's why I'm coming here.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Mrs. Belloc.  \"I've got the New England streak of\nhardness in me, though I believe that masseuse has almost ironed it out\nof my face. Do I look like a New England schoolmarm?\"\n\nMildred could truthfully answer that there wasn't a trace of it.\n\nWhen she returned to Mrs. Brindley's--already she had ceased to think\nof it as home--she announced her new plans.  Mrs. Brindley said\nnothing, but Mildred understood the quick tightening of the lines round\nher mouth and the shifting of the eyes.  She hastened to explain that\nMrs. Belloc was no longer the sort of woman or the sort of landlady she\nhad been a few months before.  Mrs. Brindley of the older New York,\ncould neither understand nor believe in the people of the new and real\nNew York whom it molds for better or for worse so rapidly--and even\nremolds again and again.  But Mildred was able to satisfy her that the\nhouse was at least not suspicious.\n\n\"It doesn't matter where you're going,\" said Mrs. Brindley.  \"It's that\nyou are going.  I can't bear giving you up.  I had hoped that our lives\nwould flow on and on together.\"  She was with difficulty controlling\nher emotions.  \"It's these separations that age one, that take one's\nlife.  I almost wish I hadn't met you.\"\n\nMildred was moved, herself.  Not so much as Mrs. Brindley because she\nhad the necessities of her career gripping her and claiming the\nstrongest feelings there were in her.  Also, she was much the younger,\nnot merely in years but in experience.  And separations have no real\npoignancy in them for youth.\n\n\"Yes, I know you love me,\" said Cyrilla, \"but love doesn't mean to you\nwhat it means to me.  I'm in that middle period of life where\neverything has its fullest meaning.  In youth we're easily consoled and\ndistracted because life seems so full of possibilities, and we can't\nbelieve friendship and love are rare, and still more rarely worth\nwhile.  In old age, when the arteries harden and the blood flows slow\nand cold, we become indifferent. But between thirty-five and fifty-five\nhow the heart can ache!\"  She smiled, with trembling lips.  \"And how it\ncan rejoice!\" she cried bravely.  \"I must not forget to mention that.\nAh, my dear, you must learn to live intensely.  If I had had your\nchance!\"\n\n\"Ridiculous!\" laughed Mildred.  \"You talk like an old woman.  And I\nnever think of you as older than myself.\"\n\n\"I AM an old woman,\" said Cyrilla.  And, with a tightening at the heart\nMildred saw, deep in the depths of her eyes, the look of old age. \"I've\nfound that I'm too old for love--for man-and-woman love--and that means\nI'm an old woman.\"\n\nMildred felt that there was only a thin barrier of reserve between her\nand some sad secret of this strange, shy, loving woman's--a barrier so\nthin that she could almost hear the stifled moan of a broken heart. But\nthe barrier remained; it would have been impossible for Cyrilla\nBrindley to talk frankly about herself.\n\nWhen Mildred came out of her room the next morning, Cyrilla had gone,\nleaving a note:\n\n\nI can't bear good-bys.  Besides, we'll see each other very soon.\nForgive me for shrinking, but really I can't.\n\n\nBefore night Mildred was settled in the new place and the new room,\nwith no sense of strangeness.  She was reproaching herself for\nhardness, for not caring about Cyrilla, the best and truest friend she\nhad ever had. But the truth lay in quite a different direction.  The\nhouse, the surroundings, where she had lived luxuriously, dreaming her\nfoolish and fatuous dreams, was not the place for such a struggle as\nwas now upon her. And for that struggle she preferred, to sensitive,\nsober, refined, impractical Cyrilla Brindley, the companionship and the\nsympathy, the practical sympathy, of Agnes Belloc.  No one need be\nashamed or nervous before Agnes Belloc about being poor or unsuccessful\nor having to resort to shabby makeshifts or having to endure coarse\ncontacts.  Cyrilla represented refinement, appreciation of the finished\nwork--luxurious and sterile appreciation and enjoyment.  Agnes\nrepresented the workshop--where all the doers of all that is done live\nand work.  Mildred was descending from the heights where live those who\nhave graduated from the lot of the human race and have lost all that\nsuperficial or casual resemblance to that race.  She was going down to\nlive with the race, to share in its lot.  She was glad Agnes Belloc was\nto be there.\n\nGeneralizing about such a haphazard conglomerate as human nature is\nhighly unsatisfactory, but it may be cautiously ventured that in New\nEngland, as in old England, there is a curiously contradictory way of\ndealing with conventionality.  Nowhere is conventionality more in\nreverence; yet when a New-Englander, man or woman, happens to elect to\nbreak with it, nowhere is the break so utter and so defiant.  If Agnes\nBelloc, cut loose from the conventions that had bound her from\nchildhood to well into middle life, had remained at home, no doubt she\nwould have spent a large part of her nights in thinking out ways of\nemploying her days in outraging the conventionalities before her\nhorrified and infuriated neighbors.  But of what use in New York to\ncuff and spit upon deities revered by only an insignificant class--and\nonly officially revered by that class? Agnes had soon seen that there\nwas no amusement or interest whatever in an enterprise which in her New\nEngland home would have filled her life to the brim with excitement.\nAlso, she saw that she was well into that time of life where the\nabsence of reputation in a woman endangers her comfort, makes her\nliable to be left alone--not despised and denounced, but simply avoided\nand ignored.  So she was telling Mildred the exact truth. She had laid\ndown the arms she had taken up against the social system, and had come\nin--and was fighting it from the safer and wiser inside.  She still\ninsisted that a woman had the same rights as a man; but she took care\nto make it clear that she claimed those rights only for others, that\nshe neither exercised them nor cared for them for herself.  And to make\nher propaganda the more effective, she was not only circumspect\nherself, but was exceedingly careful to be surrounded by circumspect\npeople.  No one could cite her case as proof that woman would expand\nliberty into license.  In theory there was nothing lively that she did\nnot look upon at least with tolerance; in practice, more and more she\ndisliked seeing one of her sex do anything that might cause the world\nto say \"woman would abuse liberty if she had it.\"  \"Sensible people,\"\nshe now said, \"do as they like.  But they don't give fools a chance to\ntitter and chatter.\"\n\nAgnes Belloc was typical--certainly of a large and growing class in\nthis day--of the decay of ancient temples and the decline of the\nold-fashioned idealism that made men fancy they lived nobly because\nthey professed and believed nobly.  She had no ethical standards.  She\nsimply met each situation as it arose and dealt with it as common sense\nseemed in that particular instance to dictate.  For a thousand years\ngenius has been striving with the human race to induce it to abandon\nits superstitions and hypocrisies and to defy common sense, so\nadaptable, so tolerant, so conducive to long and healthy and happy\nlife.  Grossly materialistic, but alluringly comfortable.  Whether for\ngood or for evil or for both good and evil, the geniuses seem in a fair\nway at last to prevail over the idealists, religious and political. And\nMrs. Belloc, without in the least realizing it, was a most significant\nsign of the times.\n\n\"Your throat seems to be better to-day,\" said she to Mildred at\nbreakfast.  \"Those simple house-remedies I tried on you last night seem\nto have done some good. Nothing like heat--hot water--and no eating.\nThe main thing was doing without dinner last night.\"\n\n\"My nerves are quieter,\" advanced Mildred as the likelier explanation\nof the return of the soul of music to its seat.  \"And my mind's at\nrest.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's good,\" said plain Agnes Belloc.  \"But getting the stomach\nstraight and keeping it straight's the main thing.  My old grandmother\ncould eat anything and do anything.  I've seen her put in a glass of\nmilk or a saucer of ice-cream on top of a tomato-salad. The way she\nkept well was, whenever she began to feel the least bit off, she\nstopped eating.  Not a bite would she touch till she felt well again.\"\n\nMildred, moved by an impulse stronger than her inclination, produced\nthe Keith paper.  \"I wish you'd read this, and tell me what you think\nof it.  You've got so much common sense.\"\n\nAgnes read it through to the end, began at the beginning and read it\nthrough again.  \"That sounds good to me,\" said she.  \"I want to think\nit over.  If you don't mind I'd like to show it to Miss Blond.  She\nknows a lot about those things.  I suppose you're going to see Mr.\nCrossley to-day?--that's the musical manager's name, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I'm going at eleven.  That isn't too early, is it?\"\n\n\"If I were you, I'd go as soon as I was dressed for the street.  And if\nyou don't get to see him, wait till you do.  Don't talk to\nunder-staffers.  Always go straight for the head man.  You've got\nsomething that's worth his while.  How did he get to be head man?\nBecause he knows a good thing the minute he sees it.  The under fellows\nare usually under because they are so taken up with themselves and with\nimpressing people how grand they are that they don't see anything else.\nSo, when you talk to them, you wear yourself out and waste your time.\"\n\n\"There's only one thing that makes me nervous,\" said Mildred. \"Everyone\nI've ever talked with about going on the stage--everyone who has talked\ncandidly--has said--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Mrs. Belloc, as Mildred paused to search for\nsmooth-sounding words in which to dress, without disguising, a\ndistinctly ugly idea.  \"I've heard that, too.  I don't know whether\nthere's anything in it or not.\"  She looked admiringly at Mildred, who\nthat morning was certainly lovely enough to tempt any man. \"If there is\nanything in it, why, I reckon YOU'D be up against it.  That's the worst\nof having men at the top in any trade and profession.  A woman's got to\nget her chance through some man, and if he don't choose to let her have\nit, she's likely to fail.\"\n\nMildred showed how this depressed her.\n\n\"But don't you fret about that till you have to,\" advised Mrs. Belloc.\n\"I've a notion that, even if it's true, it may not apply to you.  Where\na woman offers for a place that she can fill about as well as a hundred\nother women, she's at the man's mercy; but if she knows that she's far\nand away the best for the place, I don't think a man's going to stand\nin his own light.  Let him see that he can make money through YOU,\nmoney he won't make if he don't get you.  Then, I don't think you'll\nhave any trouble.\"\n\nBut Mildred's depression did not decrease.  \"If my voice could only be\nrelied on!\" she exclaimed.  \"Isn't it exasperating that I've got a\ndelicate throat!\"\n\n\"It's always something,\" said Mrs. Belloc.  \"One thing's about as bad\nas another, and anything can be overcome.\"\n\n\"No, not in my case,\" said Mildred.  \"The peculiar quality of my\nvoice--what makes it unusual--is due to the delicateness of my throat.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" said Mrs. Belloc.\n\n\"Of course, I can always sing--after a fashion,\" continued Mildred.\n\"But to be really valuable on the stage you've got to be able always to\nsing at your best. So I'm afraid I'm in the class of those who'll suit,\none about as well as another.\"\n\n\"You've got to get out of that class,\" said Mrs. Belloc.  \"The men in\nthat class, and the women, have to do any dirty work the boss sees fit\nto give 'em--and not much pay, either.  Let me tell you one thing, Miss\nStevens.  If you can't get among the few at the top in the singing\ngame, you must look round for some game where you can hope to be among\nthe few.  No matter WHAT it is.  By using your brains and working hard,\nthere's something you can do better than pretty nearly anybody else can\nor will do it.  You find that.\"\n\nThe words sank in, sank deep.  Mildred, sense of her surroundings lost,\nwas gazing straight ahead with an expression that gave Mrs. Belloc hope\nand even a certain amount of confidence.  There was a distinct advance;\nfor, after she reflected upon all that Mildred had told her, little of\nher former opinion of Mildred's chances for success had remained but a\nhope detained not without difficulty.  Mrs. Belloc knew the human race\nunusually well for a woman--unusually well for a human being of\nwhatever sex or experience.  She had discovered how rare is the\ntemperament, the combination of intelligence and tenacity, that makes\nfor success. She had learned that most people, judged by any standard,\nwere almost total failures, that most of the more or less successful\nwere so merely because the world had an enormous amount of important\nwork to be done, even though half-way, and had no one but those\nhalf-competents to do it.  As incompetence in a man would be tolerated\nwhere it would not be in a woman, obviously a woman, to get on, must\nhave the real temperament of success.\n\nShe now knew enough about Mildred to be able to \"place\" her in the\n\"lady\" class--those brought up not only knowing how to do nothing with\na money value (except lawful or unlawful man-trapping), but also\ntrained to a sensitiveness and refinement and false shame about work\nthat made it exceedingly difficult if not impossible for them to learn\nusefulness.  She knew all Mildred's handicaps, both those the girl was\nconscious of and those far heavier ones which she fatuously regarded as\nadvantages.  How was Mildred ever to learn to dismiss and disregard\nherself as the pretty woman of good social position, an object of\nadmiration and consideration?  Mildred, in the bottom of her heart, was\nregarding herself as already successful--successful at the highest a\nwoman can achieve or ought to aspire to achieve--was regarding her\ncareer, however she might talk or might fancy she believed, as a mere\nlivelihood, a side issue.  She would be perhaps more than a little\nashamed of her stage connections, should she make any, until she should\nbe at the very top--and how get to the top when one is working under\nthe handicap of shame?  Above all, how was this indulgently and\nshelteredly reared lady to become a working woman, living a routine\nlife, toiling away day in and day out, with no let up, permitting no\none and nothing to break her routine?  \"Really,\" thought Agnes Belloc,\n\"she ought to have married that Baird man--or stayed on with the nasty\ngeneral.  I wonder why she didn't!  That's the only thing that gives me\nhope.  There must be something in her--something that don't\nappear--something she doesn't know about, herself.  What is it?  Maybe\nit was only vanity and vacillation.  Again, I don't know.\"\n\nThe difficulty Mrs. Belloc labored under in her attempt to explore and\nmap Mildred Gower was a difficulty we all labor under in those same\nenterprises.  We cannot convince ourselves--in spite of experience\nafter experience--that a human character is never consistent and\nhomogeneous, is always conglomerate, that there are no two traits,\nhowever naturally exclusive, which cannot coexist in the same\npersonality, that circumstance is the dominating factor in human action\nand brings forward as dominant characteristics now one trait or set of\ntraits, consistent or inconsistent, and now another.  The Alexander who\nwas Aristotle's model pupil was the same Alexander as the drunken\ndebaucher. Indeed, may it not be that the characters which play the\nlarge parts in the comedy of life are naturally those that offer to the\nshifting winds of circumstances the greatest variety of strongly\ndeveloped and contradictory qualities?  For example, if it was\nMildred's latent courage rescued her from Siddall, was it not her\nstrong tendency to vacillation that saved her from a loveless and\nmercenary marriage to Stanley Baird?  Perhaps the deep underlying truth\nis that all unusual people have in common the character that centers a\npowerful aversion to stagnation; thus, now by their strong qualities,\nnow by their weaknesses, they are swept inevitably on and on and ever\non.  Good to-day, bad to-morrow, good again the day after, weak in this\ninstance, strong in that, now brave and now cowardly, soft at one time,\nhard at another, generous and the reverse by turns, they are consistent\nonly in that they are never at rest, but incessantly and inevitably go.\n\nMildred reluctantly rose, moved toward the door with lingering step. \"I\nguess I'd better make a start,\" said she.\n\n\"That's the talk,\" said Mrs. Belloc heartily.  But the affectionate\nglance she sent after the girl was dubious--even pitying.\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTWO minutes' walk through to Broadway, and she was at her destination.\nThere, on the other side of the way, stood the Gayety Theater, with the\noffices of Mr. Clarence Crossley overlooking the intersection of the\ntwo streets.  Crossley was intrenched in the remotest of a series of\nrooms, each tenanted by under-staffers of diminishing importance as you\ndrew way from the great man.  It was next to impossible to get at\nhim--a cause of much sneering and dissatisfaction in theatrical\ncircles. Crossley, they said, was exclusive, had the swollen head, had\nforgotten that only a few years before he had been a cheap little\nticket-seller grateful for a bow from any actor who had ever had his\nname up. Crossley insisted that he was not a victim of folie de\ngrandeur, that, on the contrary, he had become less vain as he had\nrisen, where he could see how trivial a thing rising was and how\naccidental.  Said he:\n\n\"Why do I shut myself in?  Because I'm what I am--a good thing, easy\nfruit.  You say that men a hundred times bigger than I'll ever be don't\nshut themselves up.  You say that Mountain, the biggest financier in\nthe country, sits right out where anybody can go up to him.  Yes, but\nwho'd dare go up to him?  It's generally known that he's a cannibal,\nthat he kills his own food and eats it warm and raw.  So he can afford\nto sit in the open.  If I did that, all my time and all my money would\ngo to the cheap-skates with hard-luck tales.  I don't hide because I'm\nhaughty, but because I'm weak and soft.\"\n\nIn appearance Mr. Crossley did not suggest his name. He was a tallish,\npowerful-looking person with a smooth, handsome, audacious face, with\nfine, laughing, but somehow untrustworthy eyes--at least untrustworthy\nfor women, though women had never profited by the warning.  He dressed\nin excellent taste, almost conspicuously, and the gay and expensive\ndetails of his toilet suggested a man given over to liveliness.  As a\nmatter of fact, this liveliness was potential rather than actual.  Mr.\nCrossley was always intending to resume the giddy ways of the years\nbefore he became a great man, but was always so far behind in the\nimportant things to be done and done at once that he was forced to put\noff.  However, his neckties and his shirts and his flirtations,\nuntrustworthy eyes kept him a reputation for being one of the worst\ncases in Broadway.  In vain did his achievements show that he could not\npossibly have time or strength for anything but work.  He looked like a\nrounder; he was in a business that gave endless dazzling opportunities\nfor the lively life; a rounder he was, therefore.\n\nHe was about forty.  At first glance, so vivid and energetic was he, he\nlooked like thirty-five, but at second glance one saw the lines, the\nunderlying melancholy signs of strain, the heavy price he had paid for\nphenomenal success won by a series of the sort of risks that make the\nhair fall as autumn leaves on a windy day and make such hairs as stick\nturn rapidly gray.  Thus, there were many who thought Crossley was\nthrough vanity shy of the truth by five or six years when he said forty.\n\nIn ordinary circumstances Mildred would never have got at Crossley.\nThis was the first business call of her life where she had come as an\nunknown and unsupported suitor.  Her reception would have been such at\nthe hands of Crossley's insolent and ill-mannered underlings that she\nwould have fled in shame and confusion. It is even well within the\npossibilities that she would have given up all idea of a career, would\nhave sent for Baird, and so on.  And not one of those who, timid and\ninexperienced, have suffered rude rebuff at their first advance, would\nhave condemned her.  But it so chanced--whether by good fortune or by\nill the event was to tell--that she did not have to face a single\nunderling. The hall door was open.  She entered.  It happened that\nwhile she was coming up in the elevator a quarrel between a motorman\nand a driver had heated into a fight, into a small riot.  All the\nunderlings had rushed out on a balcony that commanded a superb view of\nthe battle.  The connecting doors were open; Mildred advanced from room\nto room, seeking someone who would take her card to Mr. Crossley.  When\nshe at last faced a closed door she knocked.\n\n\"Come!\" cried a pleasant voice.\n\nAnd in she went, to face Crossley himself--Crossley, the \"weak and\nsoft,\" caught behind his last entrenchment with no chance to escape.\nHad Mildred looked the usual sort who come looking for jobs in musical\ncomedy, Mr. Crossley would not have risen--not because he was snobbish,\nbut because, being a sensitive, high-strung person, he instinctively\nadopted the manner that would put the person before him at ease.  He\nglanced at Mildred, rose, and thrust back forthwith the slangy, offhand\npersonality that was perhaps the most natural--or was it merely the\nmost used?--of his many personalities.  It was Crossley the man of the\nworld, the man of the artistic world, who delighted Mildred with a\ncourteous bow and offer of a chair, as he said:\n\n\"You wished to see me?\"\n\n\"If you are Mr. Crossley,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"I should be tempted to say I was, if I wasn't,\" said he, and his\nmanner made it a mere pleasantry to put her at ease.\n\n\"There was no one in the outside room, so I walked on and on until your\ndoor stopped me.\"\n\n\"You'll never know how lucky you were,\" said he. \"They tell me those\nfellows out there have shocking manners.\"\n\n\"Have you time to see me now?  I've come to apply for a position in\nmusical comedy.\"\n\n\"You have not been on the stage, Miss--\"\n\n\"Gower.  Mildred Gower.  I've decided to use my own name.\"\n\n\"I know you have not been on the stage.\"\n\n\"Except as an amateur--and not even that for several years.  But I've\nbeen working at my voice.\"\n\nCrossley was studying her, as she stood talking--she had refused the\nchair.  He was more than favorably impressed.  But the deciding element\nwas not Mildred's excellent figure or her charm of manner or her sweet\nand lovely face.  It was superstition.  Just at that time Crossley had\nbeen abruptly deserted by Estelle Howard; instead of going on with the\nrehearsals of \"The Full Moon,\" in which she was to be starred, she had\nrushed away to Europe with a violinist with whom she had fallen in love\nat the first rehearsal. Crossley was looking about for someone to take\nher place.  He had been entrenched in those offices for nearly five\nyears; in all that time not a single soul of the desperate crowds that\ndogged him had broken through his guard.  Crossley was as superstitious\nas was everyone else who has to do with the stage.\n\n\"What kind of a voice?\" asked he.\n\n\"Lyric soprano.\"\n\n\"You have music there.  What?\"\n\n\"'Batti Batti' and a little song in English--'The Rose and the Bee.'\"\n\nCrossley forgot his manners, turned his back squarely upon her, thrust\nhis hands deep into his trousers pockets, and stared out through the\nwindow.  He presently wheeled round.  She would not have thought his\neyes could be so keen.  Said he:  \"You were studying for grand opera?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why do you drop it and take up this?\"\n\n\"No money,\" replied she.  \"I've got to make my living at once.\"\n\n\"Well, let's see.  Come with me, please.\"\n\nThey went out by a door into the hall, went back to the rear of the\nbuilding, in at an iron door, down a flight of steep iron skeleton\nsteps dimly lighted. Mildred had often been behind the scenes in her\namateur theatrical days; but even if she had not, she would have known\nwhere she was.  Crossley called, \"Moldini! Moldini!\"\n\nThe name was caught up by other voices and repeated again and again,\nmore and more remotely.  A moment, and a small dark man with a\nsuperabundance of greasy dark hair appeared.  \"Miss Gower,\" said\nCrossley, \"this is Signor Moldini.  He will play your accompaniments.\"\nThen to the little Italian, \"Piano on the stage?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nTo Mildred with a smile, \"Will you try?\"\n\nShe bent her head.  She had no voice--not for song, not for speech, not\neven for a monosyllable.\n\nCrossley took Moldini aside where Mildred could not hear.  \"Mollie,\"\nsaid he, \"this girl crept up on me, and I've got to give her a trial.\nAs you see, she's a lady, and you know what they are.\"\n\n\"Punk,\" said Moldini.\n\nCrossley nodded.  \"She seems a nice sort, so I want to let her down\neasy.  I'll sit back in the house, in the dark.  Run her through that\n'Batti Batti' thing she's got with her.  If she's plainly on the fritz,\nI'll light a cigarette.  If I don't light up, try the other song she\nhas.  If I still don't light up make her go through that 'Ah, were you\nhere, love,' from the piece.  But if I light up, it means that I'm\ngoing to light out, and that you're to get rid of her--tell her we'll\nlet her know if she'll leave her address.  You understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\nFar from being thrilled and inspired, her surroundings made her sick at\nheart--the chill, the dampness, the bare walls, the dim, dreary lights,\nthe coarsely-painted flats--  At last she was on the threshold of her\nchosen profession.  What a profession for such a person as she had\nalways been!  She stood beside Moldini, seated at the piano.  She gazed\nat the darkness, somewhere in whose depths Crossley was hidden.  After\nseveral false starts she sang the \"Batti Batti\" through, sang it\natrociously--not like a poor professional, but like a pretentious\namateur, a reversion to a manner of singing she had once had, but had\nlong since got rid of. She paused at the end, appalled by the silence,\nby the awfulness of her own performance.\n\nFrom the darkness a slight click.  If she had known!--for, it was\nCrossley's match-safe.\n\nThe sound, slight yet so clear, startled her, roused her.  She called\nout:  \"Mr. Crossley, won't you please be patient enough to let me try\nthat again?\"\n\nA brief hesitation, then:  \"Certainly.\"\n\nOnce more she began.  But this time there was no hesitation.  From\nfirst to last she did it as Jennings had coached her, did it with all\nthe beauty and energy of her really lovely voice.  As she ended,\nMoldini said in a quiet but intense undertone:  \"Bravo!  Bravo! Fresh\nas a bird on a bright spring morning.\"  And from the darkness came:\n\"Ah--that's better, Miss Gower.  That was professional work.  Now for\nthe other.\"\n\nThus encouraged and with her voice well warmed, she could not but make\na success of the song that was nearer to what would be expected of her\nin musical comedy. Crossley called out:  \"Now, the sight singing,\nMoldini. I don't expect you to do this well, Miss Gower.  I simply wish\nto get an idea of how you'd do a piece we have in rehearsal.\"\n\n\"You'll have no trouble with this,\" said Moldini, as he opened the\ncomedy song upon the rack with a contemptuous whirl.  \"It's the easy\nshowy stuff that suits the tired business man and his laced-in wife. Go\nat it and yell.\"\n\nMildred glanced through it.  There was a subtle something in the\natmosphere now that put her at her ease.  She read the words aloud,\nlaughing at their silly sentimentality, she and Moldini and Crossley\nmaking jokes about it.  Soon she said:  \"I'm ready.\"\n\nShe sang it well.  She asked them to let her try it again.  And the\nsecond time, with the words in her mind and the simple melody, she was\nable to put expression into it and to indicate, with restraint, the\naction.  Crossley came down the aisle.\n\n\"What do you think, Mollie?\" he said to Moldini.\n\n\"We might test her at a few rehearsals.\"\n\nCrossley meekly accepted the salutary check on his enthusiasm.  \"Do you\nwish to try, Miss Gower?\"\n\nMildred was silent.  She knew now the sort of piece in which she was to\nappear.  She had seen a few of them, those cheap and vulgar farces with\ntheir thin music, their more than dubious-looking people.  What a\ncome-down!  What a degradation!  It was as bad in its way as being the\nwife of General Siddall.  And she was to do this, in preference to\nmarrying Stanley Baird.\n\n\"You will be paid, of course, during rehearsal; that is, as long as we\nare taking your time.  Fifty dollars a week is about as much as we can\nafford.\"  Crossley was watching her shrewdly, was advancing these\nremarks in response to the hesitation he saw so plainly. \"Of course it\nisn't grand opera,\" he went on.  \"In fact, it's pretty low--almost as\nlow as the public taste. You see, we aren't subsidized by millionaires\nwho want people to think they're artistic, so we have to hustle to\nseparate the public from its money.  But if you make a hit, you can\nearn enough to put you into grand opera in fine style.\"\n\n\"I never heard of anyone's graduating from here into grand opera,\" said\nMildred.\n\n\"Because our stars make so much money and make it so easily.  It'll be\nyour own fault if you don't.\"\n\n\"Can't I come to just one rehearsal--to see whether I can--can do it?\"\npleaded Mildred.\n\nCrossley, made the more eager and the more superstitious by this\nunprecedented reluctance, shook his head.\n\n\"No.  You must agree to stay as long as we want you,\" said he.  \"We\ncan't allow ourselves to be trifled with.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Mildred resignedly.  \"I will rehearse as long as you\nwant me.\"\n\n\"And will stay for the run of the piece, if we want that?\" said\nCrossley.  \"You to get a hundred a week if you are put in the cast.\nMore, of course, if you make a hit.\"\n\n\"You mean I'm to sign a contract?\" cried Mildred in dismay.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Crossley.  A truly amazing performance.  Moldini was\nnot astonished, however, for he had heard the songs, and he knew\nCrossley's difficulties through Estelle Howard's flight.  Also, he knew\nCrossley--never so \"weak and soft\" that he trifled with unlikely\ncandidates for his productions.  Crossley had got up because he knew\nwhat to do and when to do it.\n\nMildred acquiesced.  Before she was free to go into the street again,\nshe had signed a paper that bound her to rehearse for three weeks at\nfifty dollars a week and to stay on at a hundred dollars a week for\nforty weeks or the run of \"The Full Moon,\" if Crossley so desired; if\nhe did not, she was free at the end of the rehearsals. A shrewdly\none-sided contract.  But Crossley told himself he would correct it, if\nshe should by some remote chance be good enough for the part and should\nmake a hit in it.  This was no mere salve to conscience, by the way.\nCrossley would not be foolish enough to give a successful star just\ncause for disliking and distrusting him and at the earliest opportunity\nleaving him to make money for some rival manager.\n\nMrs. Belloc had not gone out, had been waiting in a fever of anxiety.\nWhen Mildred came into her sitting-room with a gloomy face and dropped\nto a chair as if her last hope had abandoned her, it was all Agnes\nBelloc could do to restrain her tears.  Said she:\n\n\"Don't be foolish, my dear.  You couldn't expect anything to come of\nyour first attempt.\"\n\n\"That isn't it,\" said Mildred.  \"I think I'll give it up--do something\nelse.  Grand opera's bad enough. There were a lot of things about it\nthat I was fighting my distaste for.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Agnes.  \"And you'd better fight them hard.  They're\nunworthy of you.\"\n\n\"But--musical comedy!  It's--frightful!\"\n\n\"It's an honest way of making a living, and that's more than can be\nsaid of--of some things.  I suppose you're afraid you'll have to wear\ntights--or some nonsense like that.\"\n\n\"No, no.  It's doing it at all.  Such rotten music--and what a\nloathsome mess!\"\n\nMrs. Belloc's eyes flashed.  \"I'm losing all patience!\" she cried.  \"I\nknow you've been brought up like a fool and always surrounded by fools.\nI suppose you'd rather sell yourself to some man.  Do you know what's\nthe matter with you, at bottom?  Why, you're lazy and you're a coward.\nToo lazy to work.  And afraid of what a lot of cheap women'll\nsay--women earning their board and clothes in about the lowest way such\na thing can be done.  Haven't you got any self-respect?\"\n\nMildred rose.  \"Mrs. Belloc,\" she said angrily, \"I can't permit even\nyou to say such things to me.\"\n\n\"The shoe seems to fit,\" retorted Mrs. Belloc.  \"I never yet saw a\nlady, a real, silk-and-diamonds, sit-in-the-parlor lady, who had any\nself-respect.  If I had my way they wouldn't get a mouthful to eat till\nthey had earned it.  That'd be a sure cure for the lady disease.  I'm\nashamed of you, Miss Stevens!  And you're ashamed of yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" said Mildred, with a sudden change of mood.\n\n\"The best thing you can do is to rest till lunch-time. Then start out\nafter lunch and hunt a job.  I'll go with you.\"\n\n\"But I've got a job,\" said Mildred.  \"That's what's the matter.\"\n\nAgnes Belloc's jaw dropped and her rather heavy eyebrows shot up toward\nthe low sweeping line of her auburn hair.  She made such a ludicrous\nface that Mildred laughed outright.  Said she:\n\n\"It's quite time.  Fifty a week, for three weeks of rehearsal.  No\ndoubt _I_ can go on if I like.  Nothing could be easier.\"\n\n\"Crossley?\"\n\n\"Yes.  He was very nice--heard me sing three pieces--and it was all\nsettled.  I'm to begin to-morrow.\"\n\nThe color rose in Agnes Belloc's face until she looked apoplectic.  She\nabruptly retreated to her bedroom. After a few minutes she came back,\nher normal complexion restored.  \"I couldn't trust myself to speak,\"\nsaid she.  \"That was the worst case of ingratitude I ever met up with.\nYou, getting a place at fifty dollars a week--and on your first\ntrial--and you come in looking as if you'd lost your money and your\nreputation.  What kind of a girl are you, anyway?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Mildred.  \"I wish I did.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry you got it so easy.  Now you'll have a false notion\nfrom the start.  It's always better to have a hard time getting things.\nThen you appreciate them, and have learned how to hold on.\"\n\n\"No trouble about holding on to this,\" said Mildred carelessly.\n\n\"Please don't talk that way, child,\" pleaded Agnes, almost tearful.\n\"It's frightful to me, who've had experience, to hear you invite a\nfall-down.\"\n\nMildred disdainfully fluttered the typewritten copy of the musical\ncomedy.  \"This is child's play,\" said she. \"The lines are beneath\ncontempt.  As for the songs, you never heard such slop.\"\n\n\"The stars in those pieces get four and five hundred, and more, a\nweek,\" said Mrs. Belloc.  \"Believe me, those managers don't pay out any\nsuch sums for child's play.  You look out.  You're going at this wrong.\"\n\n\"I shan't care if I do fail,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Do you mean that?\" demanded Mrs. Belloc.\n\n\"No, I don't,\" said Mildred.  \"Oh, I don't know what I mean.\"\n\n\"I guess you're just talking,\" said Mrs. Belloc after a reflective\nsilence.  \"I guess a girl who goes and gets a good job, first crack out\nof the box, must have a streak of shrewdness.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Mildred doubtfully.\n\n\"I guess you'll work hard, all right.  After you went out this morning,\nI took that paper down to Miss Blond.  She's crazy about it.  She wants\nto make a copy of it.  I told her I'd ask you.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Mildred. \"She says she'll return it the same day.\"\n\n\"Tell her she can keep it as long as she likes.\"\n\nMrs. Belloc eyed her gravely, started to speak, checked herself.\nInstead, she said, \"No, I shan't do that.  I'll have it back in your\nroom by this evening. You might change your mind, and want to use it.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Mildred, pointedly uninterested and ignoring Mrs.\nBelloc's delicate but distinct emphasis upon \"might.\"\n\nMrs. Belloc kept a suspicious eye upon her--an eye that was not easily\ndeceived.  The more she thought about Mildred's state of depression and\ndisdain the more tolerant she became.  That mood was the natural and\nnecessary result of the girl's bringing up and mode of life.  The\nimportant thing--and the wonderful thing--was her being able to\novercome it.  After a week of rehearsal she said:  \"I'm making the best\nof it.  But I don't like it, and never shall.\"\n\n\"I should hope not,\" replied Mrs. Belloc.  \"You're going to the top.\nI'd hate to see you contented at the bottom.  Aren't you learning a\ngood deal that'll be useful later on?\"\n\n\"That's why I'm reconciled to it,\" said she.  \"The stage director, Mr.\nRansdell, is teaching me everything--even how to sing.  He knows his\nbusiness.\"\n\nRansdell not only knew, but also took endless pains with her.  He was a\ntall, thin, dark man, strikingly handsome in the distinguished way.  So\ndistinguished looking was he that to meet him was to wonder why he had\nnot made a great name for himself.  An extraordinary mind he certainly\nhad, and an insight into the reasons for things that is given only to\ngenius.  He had failed as a composer, failed as a playwright, failed as\na singer, failed as an actor.  He had been forced to take up the\nprofession of putting on dramatic and musical plays, a profession that\nrequired vast knowledge and high talents and paid for them in niggardly\nfashion both in money and in fame.  Crossley owed to him more than to\nany other single element the series of successes that had made him\nrich; yet the ten thousand a year Crossley paid him was regarded as\nevidence of Crossley's lavish generosity and was so.  It would have\nbeen difficult to say why a man so splendidly endowed by nature and so\ntireless in improving himself was thus unsuccessful.  Probably he\nlacked judgment; indeed, that lack must have been the cause.  He could\njudge for Crossley; but not for himself, not when he had the feeling of\nultimate responsibility.\n\nMildred had anticipated the most repulsive associations--men and women\nof low origin and of vulgar tastes and of vulgarly loose lives.  She\nfound herself surrounded by simple, pleasant people, undoubtedly\nerratic for the most part in all their habits, but without viciousness.\nAnd they were hard workers, all.  Ransdell--for Crossley--tolerated no\nnonsense.  His people could live as they pleased, away from the\ntheater, but there they must be prompt and fit.  The discipline was as\nsevere as that of a monastery.  She saw many signs that all sorts of\nthings of the sort with which she wished to have no contact were going\non about her; but as she held slightly--but not at all\nhaughtily--aloof, she would have had to go out of her way to see enough\nto scandalize her.  She soon suspected that she was being treated with\nextraordinary consideration.  This was by Crossley's orders.  But the\ncarrying out of their spirit as well as their letter was due to\nRansdell.  Before the end of that first week she knew that there was\nthe personal element behind his admiration for her voice and her talent\nfor acting, behind his concentrating most of his attention upon her\npart.  He looked his love boldly whenever they were alone; he was\nalways trying to touch her--never in a way that she could have\nresented, or felt like resenting.  He was not unattractive to her, and\nshe was eager to learn all he had to teach, and saw no harm in helping\nherself by letting him love.\n\nToward the middle of the second week, when they were alone in her\ndressing-room, he--with the ingenious lack of abruptness of the\nexperienced man at the game--took her hand, and before she was ready,\nkissed her. He did not accompany these advances with an outburst of\npassionate words or with any fiery lighting up of the eyes, but calmly,\nsmilingly, as if it were what she was expecting him to do, what he had\na right to do.\n\nShe did not know quite how to meet this novel attack. She drew her hand\naway, went on talking about the part--the changes he had suggested in\nher entrance, as she sang her best solo.  He discussed this with her\nuntil they rose to leave the theater.  He looked smilingly down on her,\nand said with the flattering air of the satisfied connoisseur:\n\n\"Yes, you are charming, Mildred.  I can make a great artist and a great\nsuccess out of you.  We need each other.\"\n\n\"I certainly need you,\" said she gratefully.  \"How much you've done for\nme.\"\n\n\"Only the beginning,\" replied he.  \"Ah, I have such plans for you--such\nplans.  Crossley doesn't realize how far you can be made to go--with\nthe right training.  Without it--\"  He shook his head laughingly. \"But\nyou shall have it, my dear.\"  And he laid his hands lightly and\ncaressingly upon her shoulders.\n\nThe gesture was apparently a friendly familiarity. To resent it, even\nto draw away, would put her in the attitude of the woman absurdly\nexercised about the desirability and sacredness of her own charms.\n\nStill smiling, in that friendly, assured way, he went on:  \"You've been\nvery cold and reserved with me, my dear.  Very unappreciative.\"\n\nMildred, red and trembling, hung her head in confusion.\n\n\"I've been at the business ten years,\" he went on, \"and you're the\nfirst woman I've been more than casually interested in.  The pretty\nones were bores.  The homely ones--I can't interest myself in a homely\nwoman, no matter how much talent she has.  A woman must first of all\nsatisfy the eye.  And you--\"  He seated himself and drew her toward\nhim.  She, cold all over and confused in mind and almost stupefied,\nresisted with all her strength; but her strength seemed to be oozing\naway.  She said:\n\n\"You must not do this.  You must not do this.  I'm horribly\ndisappointed in you.\"\n\nHe drew her to his lap and held her there without any apparent tax upon\nhis strength.  He kissed her, laughingly pushing away the arms with\nwhich she tried to shield her face.  Suddenly she found strength to\nwrench herself free and stood at a distance from him. She was panting a\nlittle, was pale, was looking at him with cold anger.\n\n\"You will please leave this room,\" said she.\n\nHe lit a cigarette, crossed his legs comfortably, and looked at her\nwith laughing eyes.  \"Don't do that,\" he said genially.  \"Surely my\nlessons in acting haven't been in vain.  That's too obviously a pose.\"\n\nShe went to the mirror, arranged her hat, and moved toward the door. He\nrose and barred the way.\n\n\"You are as sensible as you are sweet and lovely,\" said he.  \"Why\nshould you insist on our being bad friends?\"\n\n\"If you don't stand aside, I'll call out to the watchman.\"\n\n\"I'd never have thought you were dishonest.  In fact, I don't believe\nit yet.  You don't look like one of those ladies who wish to take\neverything and give nothing.\"  His tone and manner were most\nattractive. Besides, she could not forget all he had done for her--and\nall he could do for her.  Said she:\n\n\"Mr. Ransdell, if I've done anything to cause you to misunderstand, it\nwas unconscious.  And I'm sorry. But I--\"\n\n\"Be honest,\" interrupted he.  \"Haven't I made it plain that I was\nfascinated by you?\"\n\nShe could not deny it.\n\n\"Haven't I been showing you that I was willing to do everything I could\nfor you?\"\n\n\"I thought you were concerned only about the success of the piece.\"\n\n\"The piece be jiggered,\" said he.  \"You don't imagine YOU are necessary\nto its success, do you?  You, a raw, untrained girl.  Don't your good\nsense tell you I could find a dozen who would do, let us say, ALMOST as\nwell?\"\n\n\"I understand that,\" murmured she.\n\n\"Perhaps you do, but I doubt it,\" rejoined he. \"Vanity's a fast growing\nweed.  However, I rather expected that you would remain sane and\nreasonably humble until you'd had a real success.  But it seems not.\nNow tell me, why should I give my time and my talent to training\nyou--to putting you in the way of quick and big success?\"\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"What did you count on giving me in return?  Your thanks?\"\n\nShe colored, hung her head.\n\n\"Wasn't I doing for you something worth while? And what had you to give\nin return?\"  He laughed with gentle mockery.  \"Really, you should have\nbeen grateful that I was willing to do so much for so little, for what\nI wanted ought--if you are a sensible woman--to seem to you a trifle in\ncomparison with what I was doing for you.  It was my part, not yours,\nto think the complimentary things about you.  How shallow and vain you\nwomen are!  Can't you see that the value of your charms is not in them,\nbut in the imagination of some man?\"\n\n\"I can't answer you,\" said she.  \"You've put it all wrong.  You\noughtn't to ask payment for a favor beyond price.\"\n\n\"No, I oughtn't to HAVE to ask,\" corrected he, in the same pleasantly\nironic way.  \"You ought to have been more than glad to give freely.\nBut, curiously, while we've been talking, I've changed my mind about\nthose precious jewels of yours.  We'll say they're pearls, and that my\ntaste has suddenly changed to diamonds.\"  He bowed mockingly.  \"So,\ndear lady, keep your pearls.\"\n\nAnd he stood aside, opening the door for her.  She hesitated, dazed\nthat she was leaving, with the feeling of the conquered, a field on\nwhich, by all the precedents, she ought to have been victor.  She\npassed a troubled night, debated whether to relate her queer experience\nto Mrs. Belloc, decided for silence.  It drafted into service all her\nreserve of courage to walk into the theater the next day and to appear\non the stage among the assembled company with her usual air.  Ransdell\ngreeted her with his customary friendly courtesy and gave her his\nattention, as always.  By the time they had got through the first act,\nin which her part was one of four of about equal importance, she had\nrecovered herself and was in the way to forget the strange stage\ndirector's strange attack and even stranger retreat.  But the situation\nchanged with the second act, in which she was on the stage all the time\nand had the whole burden.  The act as originally written had been less\ngenerous to her; but Ransdell had taken one thing after another away\nfrom the others and had given it to her.  She made her first entrance\nprecisely as he had trained her to make it and began.  A few seconds,\nand he stopped her.\n\n\"Please try again, Miss Gower,\" said he.  \"I'm afraid that won't do.\"\n\nShe tried again; again he stopped her.  She tried a third time.  His\nmanner was all courtesy and consideration, not the shade of a change.\nBut she began to feel a latent hostility.  Instinctively she knew that\nhe would no longer help her, that he would leave her to her own\nresources, and judge her by how she acquitted herself.  She made a\nblunder of her third trial.\n\n\"Really, Miss Gower, that will never do,\" said he mildly.  \"Let me show\nyou how you did it.\"\n\nHe gave an imitation of her--a slight caricature. A titter ran through\nthe chorus.  He sternly rebuked them and requested her to try again.\nHer fourth attempt was her worst.  He shook his head in gentle\nremonstrance.  \"Not quite right yet,\" said he regretfully.  \"But we'll\ngo on.\"\n\nNot far, however.  He stopped her again.  Again the courteous, kindly\ncriticism.  And so on, through the entire act.  By the end of it,\nMildred's nerves were unstrung.  She saw the whole game, and realized\nhow helpless she was.  Before the end of that rehearsal, Mildred had\nslipped back from promising professional into clumsy amateur, tolerable\nonly because of the beautiful freshness of her voice--and it was a\nquestion whether voice alone would save her.  Yet no one but Mildred\nherself suspected that Ransdell had done it, had revenged himself, had\nserved notice on her that since she felt strong enough to stand alone\nshe was to have every opportunity to do so.  He had said nothing\ndisagreeable; on the contrary, he had been most courteous, most\nforbearing.\n\nIn the third act she was worse than in the second. At the end of the\nrehearsal the others, theretofore flattering and encouraging, turned\naway to talk among themselves and avoided her.  Ransdell, about to\nleave, said:\n\n\"Don't look so down-hearted, Miss Gower.  You'll be all right\nto-morrow.  An off day's nothing.\"\n\nHe said it loudly enough for the others to hear. Mildred's face grew\nred with white streaks across it, like the prints of a lash.  The\nsubtlest feature of his malevolence had been that, whereas on other\ndays he had taken her aside to criticize her, on this day he had spoken\nout--gently, deprecatingly, but frankly--before the whole company.\nNever had Mildred Gower been so sad and so blue as she was that day and\nthat night.  She came to the rehearsal the following day with a sore\nthroat.  She sang, but her voice cracked on the high notes.  It was a\npainful exhibition.  Her fellow principals, who had been rather glad of\nher set-back the day before, were full of pity and sympathy.  They did\nnot express it; they were too kind for that.  But their looks, their\ndrawing away from her--Mildred could have borne sneers and jeers\nbetter.  And Ransdell was SO forbearing, SO gentle.\n\nHer voice got better, got worse.  Her acting remained mediocre to bad.\nAt the fifth rehearsal after the break with the stage-director, Mildred\nsaw Crossley seated far back in the dusk of the empty theater.  It was\nhis first appearance at rehearsals since the middle of the first week.\nAs soon as he had satisfied himself that all was going well, he had\ngiven his attention to other matters where things were not going well.\nMildred knew why he was there--and she acted and sang atrociously.\nRansdell aggravated her nervousness by ostentatiously trying to help\nher, by making seemingly adroit attempts to cover her\nmistakes--attempts apparently thwarted and exposed only because she was\nhopelessly bad.\n\nIn the pause between the second and third acts Ransdell went down and\nsat with Crossley, and they engaged in earnest conversation.  The\nwhile, the members of the company wandered restlessly about the stage,\nmaking feeble attempts to lift the gloom with affected cheerfulness.\nRansdell returned to the stage, went up to Mildred, who was sitting\nidly turning the leaves of a part-book.\n\n\"Miss Gower,\" said he, and never had his voice been so friendly as in\nthese regretful accents, \"don't try to go on to-day.  You're evidently\nnot yourself.  Go home and rest for a few days.  We'll get along with\nyour understudy, Miss Esmond.  When Mr. Crossley wants to put you in\nagain, he'll send for you.  You mustn't be discouraged.  I know how\nbeginners take these things to heart.  Don't fret about it.  You can't\nfail to succeed.\"\n\nMildred rose and, how she never knew, crossed the stage.  She stumbled\ninto the flats, fumbled her way to the passageway, to her\ndressing-room.  She felt that she must escape from that theater\nquickly, or she would give way to some sort of wild attack of nerves.\nShe fairly ran through the streets to Mrs. Belloc's, shut herself in\nher room.  But instead of the relief of a storm of tears, there came a\nblack, hideous depression.  Hour after hour she sat, almost without\nmotion.  The afternoon waned; the early darkness came.  Still she did\nnot move--could not move.  At eight o'clock Mrs. Belloc knocked.\nMildred did not answer.  Her door opened--she had forgotten to lock it.\nIn came Mrs. Belloc.\n\n\"Isn't that you, sitting by the window?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mildred.\n\n\"I recognized the outline of your hat.  Besides, who else could it be\nbut you?  I've saved some dinner for you.  I thought you were still\nout.\"\n\nMildred did not answer.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said Agnes?  \"Ill? bad news?\"\n\n\"I've lost my position,\" said Mildred.\n\nA pause.  Then Mrs. Belloc felt her way across the room until she was\ntouching the girl.  \"Tell me about it, dear,\" said she.\n\nIn a monotonous, lifeless way Mildred told the story. It was some time\nafter she finished when Agnes said:\n\n\"That's bad--bad, but it might be worse.  You must go to see the\nmanager, Crossley.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Tell him what you told me.\"\n\nMildred's silence was dissent.\n\n\"It can't do any harm,\" urged Agnes.\n\n\"It can't do any good,\" replied Mildred.\n\n\"That isn't the way to look at it.\"\n\nA long pause.  Then Mildred said:  \"If I got a place somewhere else,\nI'd meet the same thing in another form.\"\n\n\"You've got to risk that.\"\n\n\"Besides, I'd never have had a chance of succeeding if Mr. Ransdell\nhadn't taught me and stood behind me.\"\n\nIt was many minutes before Agnes Belloc said in a hesitating,\nrestrained voice:  \"They say that success--any kind of success--has its\nprice, and that one has to be ready to pay that price or fail.\"\n\nAgain the profound silence.  Into it gradually penetrated the soft,\ninsistent sound of the distant roar of New York--a cruel, clamorous,\ndevouring sound like a demand for that price of success.  Said Agnes\ntimidly:\n\n\"Why not go to see Mr. Ransdell.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't make it up,\" said Mildred.  \"And I--I couldn't.  I tried\nto marry Stanley Baird for money--and I couldn't.  It would be the same\nway now--only more so.\"\n\n\"But you've got to do something.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I will.\"  Mildred had risen abruptly, was standing at the\nwindow.  Agnes Belloc could feel her soul rearing defiantly at the city\ninto which she was gazing.  \"I will!\" she replied.\n\n\"It sounds as if you'd been pushed to where you'd turn and make a\nfight,\" said Agnes.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Mildred.  \"It's high time.\"\n\nShe thought out several more or less ingenious indirect routes into Mr.\nCrossley's stronghold, for use in case frontal attack failed.  But she\ndid not need them. Still, the hours she spent in planning them were by\nno means wasted.  No time is wasted that is spent in desperate,\nconcentrated thinking about any of the practical problems of life.  And\nMildred Gower, as much as any other woman of her training--or lack of\ntraining--was deficient in ability to use her mind purposefully. Most\nof us let our minds act like a sheep in a pasture--go wandering hither\nand yon, nibbling at whatever happens to offer.  Only the superior few\ndeliberately select a pasture, select a line of procedure in that\npasture and keep to it, concentrating upon what is useful to us, and\nthat alone.  So it was excellent experience for Mildred to sit down and\nthink connectedly and with wholly absorbed mind upon the phase of her\ncareer most important at the moment.  When she had worked out all the\nplans that had promise in them she went tranquilly to sleep, a stronger\nand a more determined person, for she had said with the energy that\ncounts:  \"I shall see him, somehow.  If none of these schemes works,\nI'll work out others.  He's got to see me.\"\n\nBut it was no occult \"bearing down\" that led him to order her admitted\nthe instant her card came.  He liked her; he wished to see her again;\nhe felt that it was the decent thing, and somehow not difficult gently\nbut clearly to convey to her the truth.  On her side she, who had\nlooked forward to the interview with some nervousness, was at her ease\nthe moment she faced him alone in that inner office.  He had\nextraordinary personal charm--more than Ransdell, though Ransdell had\nthe charm invariably found in a handsome human being with the\nmany-sided intellect that gives lightness of mind.  Crossley was not\nintellectual, not in the least.  One had only to glance at him to see\nthat he was one of those men who reserve all their intelligence for the\npractical sides of the practical thing that forms the basis of their\nmaterial career.  He knew something of many things, had a wonderful\nassortment of talents--could sing, could play piano or violin, could\ncompose, could act, could do mystifying card tricks, could order\nwomen's clothes as discriminatingly as he could order his own--all\nthese things a little, but nothing much except making a success of\nmusical comedy and comic opera.  He had an ambition, carefully\nrestrained in a closet of his mind, where it could not issue forth and\ninterfere with his business.  This ambition was to be a giver of grand\nopera on a superb scale.  He regarded himself as a mere\nmoney-maker--was not ashamed of this, but neither was he proud of it.\nHis ambition then represented a dream of a rise to something more than\nbusiness man, to friend and encourager and wet nurse to art.\n\nMildred Gower had happened to set his imagination to working.  The\ndiscovery that she was one of those whose personalities rouse high\nexpectations only to mock them had been a severe blow to his confidence\nin his own judgment.  Though he pretended to believe, and had the habit\nof saying that he was \"weak and soft,\" was always being misled by his\ngood nature, he really believed himself an unerring judge of human\nbeings, and, as his success evidenced, he was not far wrong.  Thus,\nthough convinced that Mildred was a \"false alarm,\" his secret vanity\nwould not let him release his original idea.  He had the tenacity that\nis an important element in all successes; and tenacity become a fixed\nhabit has even been known to ruin in the end the very careers it has\nmade.\n\nSaid Mildred, in a manner which was astonishingly unemotional and\nbusinesslike:  \"I've not come to tattle and to whine, Mr. Crossley.\nI've hesitated about coming at all, partly because I've an instinct\nit's useless, partly because what I have to say isn't easy.\"\n\nCrossley's expression hardened.  The old story!--excuses, excuses,\nself-excuse--somebody else to blame.\n\n\"If it hadn't been for Mr. Ransdell--the trouble he took with me, the\ncoaching he gave me--I'd have been a ridiculous failure at the very\nfirst rehearsal.  But--it is to Mr. Ransdell that my failure is due.\"\n\n\"My dear Miss Gower,\" said Crossley, polite but cold, \"I regret hearing\nyou say that.  The fact is very different.  Not until you had done\nso--so unacceptably at several rehearsals that news of it reached me by\nanother way--not until I myself went to Mr. Ransdell about you did he\nadmit that there could be a possibility of a doubt of your succeeding.\nI had to go to rehearsal myself and directly order him to restore Miss\nEsmond and lay you off.\"\n\nMildred was not unprepared.  She received this tranquilly.  \"Mr.\nRansdell is a very clever man,\" said she with perfect good humor. \"I've\nno hope of convincing you, but I must tell my side.\"\n\nAnd clearly and simply, with no concealments through fear of disturbing\nhis high ideal of her ladylike delicacy, she told him the story.  He\nlistened, seated well back in his tilted desk-chair, his gaze upon the\nceiling. When she finished he held his pose a moment, then got up and\npaced the length of the office several times, his hands in his pockets.\nHe paused, looked keenly at her, a good-humored smile in those eyes of\nhis so fascinating to women because of their frank wavering of an\ninconstancy it would indeed be a triumph to seize and hold. Said he:\n\n\"And your bad throat?  Did Ransdell give you a germ?\"\n\nShe colored.  He had gone straight at the weak point.\n\n\"If you'd been able to sing,\" he went on, \"nobody could have done you\nup.\"\n\nShe could not gather herself together for speech.\n\n\"Didn't you know your voice wasn't reliable when you came to me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she admitted.\n\n\"And wasn't that the REAL reason you had given up grand opera?\" pursued\nhe mercilessly.\n\n\"The reason was what I told you--lack of money,\" replied she.  \"I did\nnot go into the reason why I lacked money.  Why should I when, even on\nmy worst days, I could get through all my part in a musical\ncomedy--except songs that could be cut down or cut out?  If I could\nhave made good at acting, would you have given me up on account of my\nvoice?\"\n\n\"Not if you had been good enough,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Then I did not get my engagement on false pretenses?\"\n\n\"No.  You are right.  Still, your fall-down as a singer is the\nimportant fact.  Don't lose sight of it.\"\n\n\"I shan't,\" said she tersely.\n\nHis eyes were frankly laughing.  \"As to Ransdell--what a clever trick!\nHe's a remarkable man.  If he weren't so shrewd in those little ways,\nhe might have been a great man.  Same old story--just a little too\nsmart, and so always doing the little thing and missing the big thing.\nYes, he went gunning for you--and got you.\"  He dropped into his chair.\nHe thought a moment, laughed aloud, went on:  \"No doubt he has worked\nthat same trick many a time.  I've suspected it once or twice, but this\ntime he fooled me.  He got you, Miss Gower, and I can do nothing.  You\nmust see that I can't look after details.  And I can't give up as\ninvaluable a man as Ransdell.  If I put you back, he'd put you\nout--would make the piece fail rather than let you succeed.\"\n\nMildred was gazing somberly at the floor.\n\n\"It's hard lines--devilish hard lines,\" he went on sympathetically.\n\"But what can I do?\"\n\n\"What can I do?\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Do as all people do who succeed--meet the conditions.\"\n\n\"I'm not prepared to go as far as that, at least not yet,\" said she\nwith bitter sarcasm.  \"Perhaps when I'm actually starving and in rags--\"\n\n\"A very distressing future,\" interrupted Crossley. \"But--I didn't make\nthe world.  Don't berate me. Be sensible--and be honest, Miss Gower,\nand tell me--how could I possibly protect you and continue to give\nsuccessful shows?  If you can suggest any feasible way, I'll take it.\"\n\n\"No, there isn't any way,\" replied she, rising to go.\n\nHe rose to escort her to the hall door.  \"Personally, the Ransdell sort\nof thing is--distasteful to me.  Perhaps if I were not so busy I might\nbe forced by my own giddy misconduct to take less high ground.  I've\nobserved that the best that can be said for human nature at its best is\nthat it is as well behaved as its real temptations permit.  He was\nmaking you, you know.  You've admitted it.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt about that,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Mind you, I'm not excusing him.  I'm simply explaining him.  If your\nvoice had been all right--if you could have stood to any degree the\ntest he put you to, the test of standing alone--you'd have defeated\nhim.  He wouldn't have dared go on.  He's too shrewd to think a real\ntalent can be beaten.\"\n\nThe strong lines, the latent character, in Mildred's face were so\nstrongly in evidence that looking at her then no one would have thought\nof her beauty or even of her sex, but only of the force that resists\nall and overcomes all.  \"Yes--the voice,\" said she.  \"The voice.\"\n\n\"If it's ever reliable, come to see me.  Until then--\" He put out his\nhand.  When she gave him hers, he held it in a way that gave her no\nimpulse to draw back. \"You know the conditions of success now.  You\nmust prepare to meet them.  If you put yourself at the mercy of the\nRansdells--or any other of the petty intriguers that beset every avenue\nof success--you must take the consequences, you must conciliate them as\nbest you can. If you don't wish to be at their mercy, you must do your\npart.\"\n\nShe nodded.  He released her hand, opened the hall door.  He said:\n\n\"Forgive my little lecture.  But I like you, and I can't help having\nhope of you.\"  He smiled charmingly, his keen, inconstant eyes dimming.\n\"Perhaps I hope because you're young and extremely lovely and I am\npitifully susceptible.  You see, you'd better go. Every man's a\nRansdell at heart where pretty women are concerned.\"\n\nShe did not leave the building.  She went to the elevator and asked the\nboy where she could find Signor Moldini.  His office was the big room\non the third floor where voice candidates were usually tried out, three\ndays in the week.  At the moment he was engaged.  Mildred, seated in\nthe tiny anteroom, heard through the glass door a girl singing, or\ntrying to sing.  It was a distressing performance, and Mildred wondered\nthat Moldini could be so tolerant as to hear her through.  He came to\nthe door with her, thanked her profusely, told her he would let her\nknow whenever there was an opening \"suited to your talents.\"  As he\nobserved Mildred, he was still sighing and shaking his head over the\ndeparted candidate.\n\n\"Ugly and ignorant!\" he groaned.  \"Poor creature!  Poor, poor creature.\nShe makes three dollars a week--in a factory owned by a great\nphilanthropist. Three dollars a week.  And she has no way to make a\ncent more.  Miss Gower, they talk about the sad, naughty girls who sell\nthemselves in the street to piece out their wages.  But think, dear\nyoung lady, how infinitely better of they are than the ugly ones who\ncan't piece out their wages.\"\n\nThere he looked directly at her for the first time. Before she could\ngrasp the tragic sadness of his idea, he, with the mobility of candid\nand highly sensitized natures, shifted from melancholy to gay, for in\nlooking at her he had caught only the charm of dress, of face, of\narrangement of hair.  \"What a pleasure!\" he exclaimed, bursting into\nsmiles and seizing and kissing her gloved hands.  \"Voice like a bird,\nface like an angel--only not TOO good, no, not TOO good.  But it is so\nrare--to look as one sings, to sing as one looks.\"\n\nFor once, compliment, sincere compliment from one whose opinion was\nworth while, gave Mildred pain.  She burst out with her news:  \"Signor\nMoldini, I've lost my place in the company.  My voice has gone back on\nme.\"\n\nUsually Moldini abounded in the consideration of fine natures that have\nsuffered deeply from lack of consideration. But he was so astounded\nthat he could only stare stupidly at her, smoothing his long greasy\nhair with his thin brown hand.\n\n\"It's all my fault; I don't take care of myself,\" she went on.  \"I\ndon't take care of my health.  At least, I hope that's it.\"\n\n\"Hope!\" he said, suddenly angry.\n\n\"Hope so, because if it isn't that, then I've no chance for a career,\"\nexplained she.\n\nHe looked at her feet, pointed an uncannily long forefinger at them.\n\"The crossings and sidewalks are slush--and you, a singer, without\novershoes!  Lunacy! Lunacy!\"\n\n\"I've never worn overshoes?\" said Mildred apologetically.\n\n\"Don't tell me!  I wish not to hear.  It makes me--like madness here.\"\nHe struck his low sloping brow with his palm.  \"What vanity!  That the\nfeet may look well to the passing stranger, no overshoes! Rheumatism,\nsore throat, colds, pneumonia.  Is it not disgusting.  If you were a\nman I should swear in all the languages I know--which are five,\nincluding Hungarian, and when one swears in Hungarian it is 'going\nsome,' as you say in America.  Yes, it is going quite some.\"\n\n\"I shall wear overshoes,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"And indigestion--you have that?\"\n\n\"A little, I guess.\"\n\n\"Much--much, I tell you!\" cried Moldini, shaking the long finger at\nher.  \"You Americans!  You eat too fast and you eat too much.  That is\nwhy you are always sick, and consulting the doctors who give the\nmedicines that make worse, not better.  Yes, you Americans are like\nchildren.  You know nothing.  Sing? Americans cannot sing until they\nlearn that a stomach isn't a waste-basket, to toss everything into. You\nhave been to that throat specialist, Hicks?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Mildred brightening.  \"He said there was nothing\norganically wrong.\"\n\n\"He is an ass, and a criminal.  He ruins throats. He likes to cut, and\nhe likes to spray.  He sprays those poisons that relieve colds and\nparalyze the throat and cords.  Americans sing?  It is to laugh!  They\nhave too many doctors; they take too many pills.  Do you know what your\nnational emblem should be?  A dollar-sign--yes.  But that for all\nnations.  No, a pill--a pill, I tell you.  You take pills?\"\n\n\"Now and then,\" said Mildred, laughing.  \"I admit I have several kinds\nalways on hand.\"\n\n\"You see!\" cried he triumphantly.  \"No, it is not mere art that America\nneeds, but more sense about eating--and to keep away from the doctors.\nPeople full of pills, they cannot make poems and pictures, and write\noperas and sing them.  Throw away those pills, dear young lady, I\nimplore you.\"\n\n\"Signor Moldini, I've come to ask you to help me.\"\n\nInstantly the Italian cleared his face of its half-humorous,\nhalf-querulous expression.  In its place came a grave and courteous\neagerness to serve her that was a pleasure, even if it was not\naltogether sincere.  And Mildred could not believe it sincere.  Why\nshould he care what became of her, or be willing to put himself out for\nher?\n\n\"You told me one day that you had at one time taught singing,\"\ncontinued she.\n\n\"Until I was starved out?\" replied he.  \"I told people the truth.  If\nthey could not sing I said so.  If they sang badly I told them why, and\nit was always the upset stomach, the foolish food, and people will not\ntake care about food.  They will eat what they please, and they say\neating is good for them, and that anyone who opposes them is a crank.\nSo most of my pupils left, except those I taught for nothing--and they\ndid not heed me, and came to nothing.\"\n\n\"You showed me in ten minutes one day how to cure my worst fault.  I've\nsung better, more naturally ever since.\"\n\n\"You could sing like the birds.  You do--almost. You could be taught to\nsing as freely and sweetly and naturally as a flower gives perfume.\nThat is YOUR divine gift, young lady song as pure and fresh as a bird's\nsong raining down through the leaves from the tree-top.\"\n\n\"I have no money.  I've got to get it, and I shall get it,\" continued\nMildred.  \"I want you to teach me--at any hour that you are free.  And\nI want to know how much you will charge, so that I shall know how much\nto get.\"\n\n\"Two dollars a lesson.  Or, if you take six lessons a week, ten\ndollars.  Those were my terms.  I could not take less.\"\n\n\"It is too little,\" said Mildred.  \"The poorest kinds of teachers get\nfive dollars an hour--and teach nothing.\"\n\n\"Two dollars, ten dollars a week,\" replied he.  \"It is the most I ever\ncould get.  I will not take more from you.\"\n\n\"It is too little,\" said she.  \"But I'll not insist--for obvious\nreasons.  Now, if you'll give me your home address, I'll go.  When I\nget the money, I'll write to you.\"\n\n\"But wait!\" cried he, as she rose to depart.  \"Why so hurried?  Let us\nsee.  Take of the wrap.  Step behind the screen and loosen your corset.\nPerhaps even you could take it off?\"\n\n\"Not without undressing,\" said Mildred.  \"But I can do that if it's\nnecessary.\"  She laughed queerly. \"From this time on I'll do ANYTHING\nthat's necessary.\"\n\n\"No,--never mind.  The dress of woman--of your kind of women.  It is\nnot serious.\"  He laughed grimly.  \"As for the other kind, their dress\nis the only serious thing about them.  It is a mistake to think that\nwomen who dress badly are serious.  My experience has been that they\nare the most foolish of all.  Fashionable dress--it is part of a\nwoman's tools.  It shows that she is good at her business.  The women\nwho try to dress like men, they are good neither at men's business nor\nat women's.\"\n\nThis, while Mildred was behind the screen, loosening her\ncorset--though, in fact, she wore it so loose at all times that she\ninconvenienced herself simply to show her willingness to do as she was\ntold.  When she came out, Moldini put her through a rigid physical\nexamination--made her breathe while he held one hand on her stomach,\nthe other on her back, listened at her heart, opened wide her throat\nand peered down, thrust his long strong fingers deep into the muscles\nof her arms, her throat, her chest, until she had difficulty in not\ncrying out with pain.\n\n\"The foundation is there,\" was his verdict.  \"You have a good body,\ngood muscles, but flabby--a lady's muscles, not an opera singer's.  And\nyou are stiff--not so stiff as when you first came here, but stiff for\na professional.  Ah, we must go at this scientifically, thoroughly.\"\n\n\"You will teach me to breathe--and how to produce my voice naturally?\"\n\n\"I will teach you nothing,\" replied he.  \"I will tell you what to do,\nand you will teach yourself.  You must get strong--strong in the supple\nway--and then you will sing as God intended.  The way to sing, dear\nyoung lady, is to sing.  Not to breathe artificially, and make faces,\nand fuss with your throat, but simply to drop your mouth and throat\nopen and let it out!\"\n\nMildred produced from her hand-bag the Keith paper.  \"What do YOU think\nof that?\" she asked.\n\nPresently he looked up from his reading.  \"This part I have seen\nbefore,\" said he.  \"It is Lucia Rivi's. Her cousin, Lotta Drusini,\nshowed it to me--she was a great singer also.\"\n\n\"You approve of it?\"\n\n\"If you will follow that for two years, faithfully, you will be\nsecurely great, and then you will follow it all your singing life--and\nit will be long.  But remember, dear young lady, I said IF you follow\nit, and I said faithfully.  I do not believe you can.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Because that means self-denial, colossal self-denial. You love things\nto eat--yes?\"\n\nMildred nodded.\n\n\"We all do,\" said Moldini.  \"And we hate routine, and we like foolish,\naimless little pleasures of all kinds.\"\n\n\"And it will be two years before I can try grand opera--can make my\nliving?\" said Mildred slowly.\n\n\"I did not say that.  I said, before you would be great.  No, you can\nsing, I think, in--wait.\"\n\nMoldini flung rapidly through an enormous mass of music on a large\ntable.  \"Ah, here!\" he cried, and he showed her a manuscript of scales.\n\"Those two papers. It does not look much?  Well, I have made it up,\nmyself.  And when you can sing those two papers perfectly, you will be\na greater singer than any that ever lived.\"  He laughed delightedly.\n\"Yes, it is all there--in two pages.  But do not weep, dear lady,\nbecause you will never sing them perfectly.  You will do very well if--\nAlways that if, remember!  Now, let us see.  Take this, sit in the\nchair, and begin.  Don't bother about me.  I expect nothing.  Just do\nthe best you can.\"\n\nDesperation, when it falls short of despair, is the best word for\nachievement.  Mildred's voice, especially at the outset, was far from\nperfect condition.  Her high notes, which had never been developed\nproperly, were almost bad.  But she acquitted herself admirably from\nthe standpoint of showing what her possibilities were.  And Moldini,\nunkempt, almost unclean, but as natural and simple and human a soul as\never paid the penalties of poverty and obscurity and friendlessness for\nbeing natural and simple and human, exactly suited her peculiar\ntemperament.  She knew that he liked her, that he believed in her; she\nknew that he was as sympathetic toward her as her own self, that there\nwas no meanness anywhere in him.  So she sang like a bird--a bird that\nwas not too well in soul or in body, but still a bird out in the\nsunshine, with the airs of spring cheering his breast and its foliage\ngladdening his eyes.  He kept her at it for nearly an hour.  She saw\nthat he was pleased, that he had thought out some plan and was bursting\nto tell her, but had forbidden himself to speak of it.  He said:\n\n\"You say you have no money?\"\n\n\"No, but I shall get it.\"\n\n\"You may have to pay high for it--yes?\"\n\nShe colored, but did not flinch.  \"At worst, it will be--unpleasant,\nbut that's all.\"\n\n\"Wait one--two days--until you hear from me. I may--I do not say will,\nbut may--get it.  Yes, I who have nothing.\"  He laughed gayly.  \"And\nwe--you and I--we will divide the spoils.\"  Gravely.  \"Do not\nmisunderstand.  That was my little joke.  If I get the money for you it\nwill be quite honorable and businesslike. So--wait, dear young lady.\"\n\nAs she was going, she could not resist saying:\n\n\"You are SURE I can sing?--IF, of course--always the if.\"\n\n\"It is not to be doubted.\"\n\n\"How well, do you think?\"\n\n\"You mean how many dollars a night well?  You mean as well as this\ngreat singer or that?  I do not know.  And you are not to compare\nyourself with anyone but yourself.  You will sing as well as Mildred\nGower at her best.\"\n\nFor some reason her blood went tingling through her veins.  If she had\ndared she would have kissed him.\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHAT same afternoon Donald Keith, arrived at the top of Mrs. Belloc's\nsteps, met Mildred coming out. Seeing their greeting, one would have\nthought they had seen each other but a few minutes before or were\ncasual acquaintances.  Said she:\n\n\"I'm going for a walk.\"\n\n\"Let's take the taxi,\" said he.\n\nThere it stood invitingly at the curb.  She felt tired. She disliked\nwalking.  She wished to sit beside him and be whirled away--out of the\nnoisy part of the city, up where the air was clean and where there were\nno crowds. But she had begun the regimen of Lucia Rivi.  She hesitated.\nWhat matter if she began now or put off beginning until after this one\nlast drive?\n\n\"No, we will walk,\" said she.\n\n\"But the streets are in frightful condition.\"\n\nShe thrust out a foot covered with a new and shiny storm-rubber.\n\n\"Let's drive to the park then.  We'll walk there.\"\n\n\"No.  If I get into the taxi, I'll not get out.  Send it away.\"\n\nWhen they were moving afoot up Madison Avenue, he said:  \"What's the\nmatter?  This isn't like you.\"\n\n\"I've come to my senses,\" replied she.  \"It may be too late, but I'm\ngoing to see.\"\n\n\"When I called on Mrs. Brindley the other day,\" said he, \"she had your\nnote, saying that you were going into musical comedy with Crossley.\"\n\n\"That's over,\" said she.  \"I lost my voice, and I lost my job.\"\n\n\"So I heard,\" said he.  \"I know Crossley.  I dropped in to see him this\nmorning, and he told me about a foolish, fashionable girl who made a\nbluff at going on the stage--he said she had a good voice and was a\nswell looker, but proved to be a regular 'four-flusher.' I recognized\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said she dryly.\n\n\"So, I came to see you.\"\n\nShe inquired about Mrs. Brindley and then about Stanley Baird.  Finding\nthat he was in Italy, she inquired:  \"Do you happen to know his\naddress?\"\n\n\"I'll get it and send it to you.  He has taken a house at Monte Carlo\nfor the winter.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I shall stay here--I think.\"\n\n\"You may join him?\"\n\n\"It depends\"--he looked at her--\"upon you.\"\n\nHe could put a wonderful amount of meaning into a slight inflection.\nShe struggled--not in vain--to keep from changing expression.\n\n\"You realize now that the career is quite hopeless?\" said he.\n\nShe did not answer.\n\n\"You do not like the stage life?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And the stage life does not like you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Your voice lacks both strength and stability?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you have found the one way by which you could get on--and you\ndon't like it?\"\n\n\"Crossley told you?\" said she, the color flaring.\n\n\"Your name was not mentioned.  You may not believe it, but Crossley is\na gentleman.\"\n\nShe walked on in silence.\n\n\"I did not expect your failure to come so soon--or in quite that way,\"\nhe went on.  \"I got Mrs. Brindley to exact a promise from you that\nyou'd let her know about yourself.  I called on Mrs. Belloc one day\nwhen you were out, and gave her my confidence and got hers--and assured\nmyself that you were in good hands. Crossley's tale gave me--a shock.\nI came at once.\"\n\n\"Then you didn't abandon me to my fate, as I thought?\"\n\nHe smiled in his strange way.  \"I?--when I loved you?  Hardly.\"\n\n\"Then you did interest yourself in me because you cared--precisely as I\nsaid,\" laughed she.\n\n\"And I should have given you up if you had succeeded--precisely as I\nsaid,\" replied he.\n\n\"You wished me to fail?\"\n\n\"I wished you to fail.  I did everything I could to help you to\nsucceed.  I even left you absolutely alone, set you in the right\nway--the only way in which anyone can win success.\"\n\n\"Yes, you made me throw away the crutches and try to walk.\"\n\n\"It was hard to do that.  Those strains are very wearing at my time of\nlife.\"\n\n\"You never were any younger, and you'll never be any older,\" laughed\nshe.  \"That's your charm--one of them.\"\n\n\"Mildred, do you still care?\"\n\n\"How did you know?\" inquired she mockingly.\n\n\"You didn't try to conceal it.  I'd not have ventured to say and do the\nthings I said and did if I hadn't felt that we cared for each other.\nBut, so long as you were leading that fatuous life and dreaming those\nfoolish dreams, I knew we could never be happy.\"\n\n\"That is true--oh, SO true,\" replied she.\n\n\"But now--you have tried, and that has made a woman of you.  And you\nhave failed, and that has made you ready to be a wife--to be happy in\nthe quiet, private ways.\"\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"I can make enough for us both--as much as we will need or want--as\nmuch as you please, if you aren't too extravagant.  And I can do it\neasily.  It's making little sums--a small income--that's hard in this\nridiculous world.  Let's marry, go to California or Europe for several\nmonths, then come back here and live like human beings.\"\n\nShe was silent.  Block after block they walked along, as if neither had\nanything especial in mind, anything worth the trouble of speech.\nFinally he said:\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I can't answer--yet,\" said she.  \"Not to-day--not till I've thought.\"\n\nShe glanced quickly at him.  Over his impassive face, so beautifully\nregular and, to her, so fascinating, there passed a quick dark shadow,\nand she knew that he was suffering.  He laughed quietly, his old\ncareless, indifferent laugh.\n\n\"Oh, yes, you can answer,\" said he.  \"You have answered.\"\n\nShe drew in her breath sharply.\n\n\"You have refused.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that, Donald?\" she pleaded.\n\n\"To hesitate over a proposal is to refuse,\" said he with gentle\nraillery.  \"A man is a fool who does not understand and sheer off when\na woman asks for time.\"\n\n\"You know that I love you,\" she cried.\n\n\"I also know that you love something else more. But it's finished.\nLet's talk about something else.\"\n\n\"Won't you let me tell you why I hesitate?\" begged she.\n\n\"It doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"But it does.  Yes, I do refuse, Donald.  I'll never marry you until I\nam independent.  You said a while ago that what I've been through had\nmade a woman of me.  Not yet.  I'm only beginning.  I'm still\nweak--still a coward.  Donald, I must and will be free.\"\n\nHe looked full at her, with a strange smile in his brilliant eyes. Said\nhe, with obvious intent to change the subject:  \"Mrs. Brindley's very\nunhappy that you haven't been to see her.\"\n\n\"When you asked me to marry you, the only reason I almost accepted was\nbecause I want someone to support me.  I love you--yes.  But it is as\none loves before one has given oneself and has lived the same life with\nanother.  In the ordinary sense, it's love that I feel.  But--do you\nunderstand me, dearest?--in another sense, it's only the hope of love,\nthe belief that love will come.\"\n\nHe stopped short and looked at her, his eyes alive with the stimulus of\na new and startling idea.\n\n\"If you and I had been everything to each other, and you were saying\n'Let us go on living the one life' and I were hesitating, then you'd be\nright.  And I couldn't hesitate, Donald.  If you were mine, nothing\ncould make me give you up, but when it's only the hope of having you,\nthen pride and self-respect have a chance to be heard.\"\n\nHe was ready to move on.  \"There's something in that,\" said he, lapsed\ninto his usual seeming of impassiveness.  \"But not much.\"\n\n\"I never before knew you to fail to understand.\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly.  You care, but you don't care enough to suit\nme.  I haven't waited all these years before giving a woman my love, to\nbe content with a love seated quietly and demurely between pride and\nself-respect.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't marry me until I had failed,\" said she shrewdly.  \"Now\nyou attack me for refusing to marry you until I've succeeded.\"\n\nA slight shrug.  \"Proposal withdrawn,\" said he. \"Now let's talk about\nyour career, your plans.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to understand myself a little,\" said she.  \"I suppose\nyou think that sort of personal talk is very silly and vain--and\ntrivial.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" replied he, \"it isn't absolutely necessary to\nunderstand oneself.  One is swept on in the same general direction,\nanyhow.  But understanding helps one to go faster and steadier.\"\n\n\"It began, away back, when I was a girl--this idea of a career.  I\nenvied men and despised women, the sort of women I knew and met with. I\ndidn't realize why, then.  But it was because a man had a chance to be\nsomebody in himself and to do something, while a woman was just a--a\nmore or less ornamental belonging of some man's--what you want me to\nbecome now.\"\n\n\"As far as possible from my idea.\"\n\n\"Don't you want me to belong to you?\"\n\n\"As I belong to you.\"\n\n\"That sounds well, but it isn't what could happen. The fact is, Donald,\nthat I want to belong to you--want to be owned by you and to lose\nmyself in you. And it's that I'm fighting.\"\n\nShe felt the look he was bending upon her, and glowed and colored under\nit, but did not dare to turn her eyes to meet it.  Said he:  \"Why fight\nit?  Why not be happy?\"\n\n\"Ah, but that's just it,\" cried she.  \"I shouldn't be happy.  And I\nshould make you miserable.  The idea of a career--the idea that's\nrooted deep in me and can't ever be got out, Donald; it would torment\nme.  You couldn't kill it, no matter how much you loved me.  I'd yield\nfor the time.  Then, I'd go back--or, if I didn't, I'd be wretched and\nmake you wish you'd never seen me.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said he.  \"I don't believe it, but I understand.\"\n\n\"You think I'm deceiving myself, because you saw me wasting my life,\nplaying the idler and the fool, pretending I was working toward a\ncareer when I was really making myself fit for nothing but to be\nStanley Baird's mistress.\"\n\n\"And you're still deceiving yourself.  You won't see the truth.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said she.  \"I must go on and make a career--some kind of a\ncareer.\"\n\n\"At what?\"\n\n\"At grand opera.\"\n\n\"How'll you get the money?\"\n\n\"Of Stanley, if necessary.  That's why I asked his address.  I shan't\nask for much.  He'll not refuse.\"\n\n\"A few minutes ago you were talking of self-respect.\"\n\n\"As something I hoped to get.  It comes with independence.  I'll pay\nany price to get it.\"\n\n\"Any price?\" said he, and never before had she seen his self-control in\ndanger.\n\n\"I shan't ask Stanley until my other plans have failed.\"\n\n\"What other plans?\"\n\n\"I am going to ask Mrs. Belloc for the money.  She could afford to\ngive--to lend--the little I'd want. I'm going to ask her in such a way\nthat it will be as hard as possible for her to refuse.  That isn't\nladylike, but--I've dropped out of the lady class.\"\n\n\"And if she refuses?\"\n\n\"Then I'll go one after another to several very rich men I know, and\nask them as a business proposition.\"\n\n\"Go in person,\" advised he with an undisguised sneer.\n\n\"I'll raise no false hopes in them,\" she said.  \"If they choose to\ndelude themselves, I'll not go out of my way to undeceive them--until I\nhave to.\"\n\n\"So THIS is Mildred Gower?\"\n\n\"You made that remark before.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"When Stanley showed you a certain photograph of me.\"\n\n\"I remember.  This is the same woman.\"\n\n\"It's me,\" laughed she.  \"The real me.  You'd not care to be married to\nher?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he.  Then, after a brief silence:  \"Yet, curiously, it was\nthat woman with whom I fell in love. No, not exactly in love, for I've\nbeen thinking about what you said as to the difference between love in\nposse and love in esse, to put it scientifically--between love as a\nprospect and love as a reality.\"\n\n\"And I was right,\" said she.  \"It explains why marriages go to pieces\nand affairs come to grief.  Those lovers mistook love's promise to come\nfor fulfillment. Love doesn't die.  It simply fails to come--doesn't\nredeem its promise.\"\n\n\"That's the way it might be with us,\" said he. \"That's the way it would\nbe with us,\" rejoined she.\n\nHe did not answer.  When they spoke again it was of indifferent\nmatters.  An hour and a half after they started, they were at Mrs.\nBelloc's again.  She asked him to have tea in the restaurant next door.\nHe declined.  He went up the steps with her, said:\n\n\"Well, I wish you luck.  Moldini is the best teacher in America.\"\n\n\"How did you know Moldini was to teach me?\" exclaimed she.\n\nHe smiled, put out his hand in farewell.  \"Crossley told me.  Good-by.\"\n\n\"He told Crossley!  I wonder why.\"  She was so interested in this new\nphase that she did not see his outstretched hand, or the look of bitter\nirony that came into his eyes at this proof of the subordinate place\nlove and he had in her thoughts.\n\n\"I'm nervous and anxious,\" she said apologetically. \"Moldini told me he\nhad some scheme about getting the money.  If he only could!  But no\nsuch luck for me,\" she added sadly.\n\nKeith hesitated, debated with himself, said:  \"You needn't worry.\nMoldini got it--from Crossley. Fifty dollars a week for a year.\"\n\n\"You got Crossley to do it?\"\n\n\"No.  He had done it before I saw him.  He had just promised Moldini\nand was cursing himself as 'weak and soft.'  But that means nothing.\nYou may be sure he did it because Moldini convinced him it was a good\nspeculation.\"\n\nShe was radiant.  She had not vanity enough where he was concerned to\nbelieve that he deeply cared, that her joy would give him pain because\nit meant forgetfulness of him.  Nor was she much impressed by the\nexpression of his eyes.  And even as she hurt him, she made him love\nher the more; for he appreciated how rare was the woman who, in such\ncircumstances, does not feed her vanity with pity for the poor man\nsuffering so horribly because he is not to get her precious self.\n\nIt flashed upon her why he had not offered to help her.  \"There isn't\nanybody like you,\" said she, with no explanation of her apparent\nirrelevancy.\n\n\"Don't let Moldini see that you know,\" said he, with characteristic\nfine thoughtfulness for others in the midst of his own unhappiness. \"It\nwould deprive him of a great pleasure.\"\n\nHe was about to go.  Suddenly her eyes filled and, opening the outer\ndoor, she drew him in.  \"Donald,\" she said, \"I love you.  Take me in\nyour arms and make me behave.\"\n\nHe looked past her; his arms hung at his sides.  Said he:  \"And\nto-night I'd get a note by messenger saying that you had taken it all\nback.  No, the girl in the photograph--that was you.  She wasn't made\nto be MY wife.  Or I to be her husband.  I love you because you are\nwhat you are.  I should not love you if you were the ordinary woman,\nthe sort who marries and merges.  But I'm old enough to spare\nmyself--and you--the consequences of what it would mean if we were\nanything but strangers to each other.\"\n\n\"Yes, you must keep away--altogether.  If you didn't, I'd be neither\nthe one thing nor the other, but just a poor failure.\"\n\n\"You'll not fail,\" said he.  \"I know it.  It's written in your face.\"\nHe looked at her.  She was not looking at him, but with eyes gazing\nstraight ahead was revealing that latent, inexplicable power which,\nwhen it appeared at the surface, so strongly dominated and subordinated\nher beauty and her sex.  He shut his teeth together hard and glanced\naway.\n\n\"You will not fail,\" he repeated bitterly.  \"And that's the worst of\nit.\"\n\nWithout another word, without a handshake, he went. And she knew that,\nexcept by chance, he would never see her again--or she him.\n\nMoldini, disheveled and hysterical with delight and suspense, was in\nthe drawing-room--had been there half an hour.  At first she could\nhardly force her mind to listen; but as he talked on and on, he\ncaptured her attention and held it.\n\n\nThe next day she began with Moldini, and put the Lucia Rivi system into\nforce in all its more than conventual rigors.  And for about a month\nshe worked like a devouring flame.  Never had there been such energy,\nsuch enthusiasm.  Mrs. Belloc was alarmed for her health, but the Rivi\nsystem took care of that; and presently Mrs. Belloc was moved to say,\n\"Well, I've often heard that hard work never harmed anyone, but I never\nbelieved it.  Now I know the truth.\"\n\nThen Mildred went to Hanging Rock to spend Saturday to Monday with her\nmother.  Presbury, reduced now by various infirmities--by absolute\ndeafness, by dimness of sight, by difficulty in walking--to where\neating was his sole remaining pleasure, or, indeed, distraction, spent\nall his time in concocting dishes for himself.  Mildred could not\nresist--and who can when seated at table with the dish before one's\neyes and under one's nose.  The Rivi regimen was suspended for the\nvisit.  Mildred, back in New York and at work again, found that she was\napparently none the worse for her holiday, was in fact better.  So she\ndrifted into the way of suspending the regimen for an evening now and\nthen--when she dined with Mrs. Brindley, or when Agnes Belloc had\nsomething particularly good.  All went well for a time.  Then--a cold.\nShe neglected it, feeling sure it could not stay with one so soundly\nhealthy through and through.  But it did stay; it grew worse.  She\ndecided that she ought to take medicine for it.  True, starvation was\nthe cure prescribed by the regimen, but Mildred could not bring herself\nto two or three days of discomfort.  Also, many people told her that\nsuch a cure was foolish and even dangerous. The cold got better, got\nworse, got better.  But her throat became queer, and at last her voice\nleft her. She was ashamed to go to Moldini in such a condition. She\ndropped in upon Hicks, the throat specialist.  He \"fixed her up\"\nbeautifully with a few sprayings.  A week--and her voice left her\nagain, and Hicks could not bring it back.  As she left his office, it\nwas raining--an icy, dreary drizzle.  She splashed her way home, in\nabout the lowest spirits she had ever known.  She locked her door and\nseated herself at the window and stared out, while the storm raged\nwithin her.  After an hour or two she wrote and sent Moldini a note: \"I\nhave been making a fool of myself.  I'll not come again until I am all\nright.  Be patient with me.  I don't think this will occur again.\"  She\nfirst wrote \"happen.\"  She scratched it out and put \"occur\" in its\nplace.  Not that Moldini would have noted the slip; simply that she\nwould not permit herself the satisfaction of the false and\nself-excusing \"happen.\"  It had not been a \"happen.\"  It had been a\ndeliberate folly, a lapse to the Mildred she had buried the day she\nsent Donald Keith away.  When the note was on its way, she threw out\nall her medicines, and broke the new spraying apparatus Hicks had\ninstructed her to buy.\n\nShe went back to the Rivi regime.  A week passed, and she was little\nbetter.  Two weeks, and she began to mend.  But it was six weeks before\nthe last traces of her folly disappeared.  Moldini said not a word,\ngave no sign.  Once more her life went on in uneventful, unbroken\nroutine--diet, exercise, singing--singing, exercise, diet--no\ndistractions except an occasional visit to the opera with Moldini, and\nshe was hating opera now.  All her enthusiasm was gone.  She simply\nworked doggedly, drudged, slaved.\n\nWhen the days began to grow warm, Mrs. Belloc said: \"I suppose you'll\nsoon be off to the country?  Are you going to visit Mrs. Brindley?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mildred.\n\n\"Then come with me.\"\n\n\"Thank you, but I can't do it.\"\n\n\"But you've got to rest somewhere.\"\n\n\"Rest?\" said Mildred.  \"Why should I rest?\"\n\nMrs. Belloc started to protest, then abruptly changed.  \"Come to think\nof it, why should you? You're in perfect health, and it'll be time\nenough to rest when you 'get there.'\"\n\n\"I'm tired through and through,\" said Mildred, \"but it isn't the kind\nof tired that could be rested except by throwing up this frightful\nnightmare of a career.\"\n\n\"And you can't do that.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" said Mildred, her lips compressed and her eyes narrowed.\n\nShe and Moldini--and fat, funny little Mrs. Moldini--went to the\nmountains.  And she worked on.  She would listen to none of the\nsuggestions about the dangers of keeping too steadily at it, about\nworking oneself into a state of staleness, about the imperative demands\nof the artistic temperament for rest, change, variety.  \"It may be so,\"\nshe said to Mrs. Brindley. \"But I've gone mad.  I can no more drop this\nroutine than--than you could take it up and keep to it for a week.\"\n\n\"I'll admit I couldn't,\" said Cyrilla.  \"And Mildred, you're making a\nmistake.\"\n\n\"Then I'll have to suffer for it.  I must do what seems best to me.\"\n\n\"But I'm sure you're wrong.  I never knew anyone to act as you're\nacting.  Everyone rests and freshens up.\"\n\nMildred lost patience, almost lost her temper. \"You're trying to tempt\nme to ruin myself,\" she said. \"Please stop it.  You say you never knew\nanyone to do as I'm doing.  Very well.  But how many girls have you\nknown who have succeeded?\"\n\nCyrilla hesitatingly confessed that she had known none.\n\n\"Yet you've known scores who've tried.\"\n\n\"But they didn't fail because they didn't work enough. Many of them\nworked too much.\"\n\nMildred laughed.  \"How do you know why they failed?\" said she.  \"You\nhaven't thought about it as I have.  You haven't LIVED it.  Cyrilla, I\nserved my apprenticeship at listening to nonsense about careers. I want\nto have nothing to do with inspiration, and artistic temperament, and\nspontaneous genius, and all the rest of the lies.  Moldini and I know\nwhat we are about.  So I'm living as those who have succeeded lived and\nnot as those who have failed.\"\n\nCyrilla was silenced, but not convinced.  The amazing improvement in\nMildred's health, the splendid slim strength and suppleness of her\nbody, the new and stable glories of her voice--all these she knew\nabout, but they did not convince her.  She believed in work, in hard\nwork, but to her work meant the music itself.  She felt that the Rivi\nsystem and the dirty, obscure little Moldini between them were\ndestroying Mildred by destroying all \"temperament\" in her.\n\nIt was the old, old criticism of talent upon genius. Genius has always\nwon in its own time and generation all the world except talent.  To\ntalent contemporaneous genius, genius seen at its patient, plodding\ntoil, seems coarse and obvious and lacking altogether in inspiration.\nTalent cannot comprehend that creation is necessarily in travail and in\nall manner of unloveliness.\n\nMildred toiled on like a slave under the lash, and Moldini and the Rivi\nsystem were her twin relentless drivers.  She learned to rule herself\nwith an iron hand. She discovered the full measure of her own\ndeficiencies, and she determined to make herself a competent lyric\nsoprano, perhaps something of a dramatic soprano. She dismissed from\nher mind all the \"high\" thoughts, all the dreams wherewith the little\npeople, even the little people who achieve a certain success, beguile\nthe tedium of their journey along the hard road.  She was not working\nto \"interpret the thought of the great master\" or to \"advance the\nsinging art yet higher\" or even to win fame and applause.  She had one\nobject--to earn her living on the grand opera stage, and to earn it as\na prima donna because that meant the best living.  She frankly told\nCyrilla that this was her object, when Cyrilla forced her one day to\ntalk about her aims.  Cyrilla looked pained, broke a melancholy silence\nto say:\n\n\"I know you don't mean that.  You are too intelligent.  You sing too\nwell.\"\n\n\"Yes, I mean just that,\" said Mildred.  \"A living.\"\n\n\"At any rate, don't say it.  You give such a false impression.\"\n\n\"To whom?  Not to Crossley, and not to Moldini, and why should I care\nwhat any others think?  They are not paying my expenses.  And\nregardless of what they think now, they'll be at my feet if I succeed,\nand they'll put me under theirs if I don't.\"\n\n\"How hard you have grown,\" cried Cyrilla.\n\n\"How sensible, you mean.  I've merely stopped being a self-deceiver and\na sentimentalist.\"\n\n\"Believe me, my dear, you are sacrificing your character to your\nambition.\"\n\n\"I never had any real character until ambition came,\" replied Mildred.\n\"The soft, vacillating, sweet and weak thing I used to have wasn't\ncharacter.\"\n\n\"But, dear, you can't think it superior character to center one's whole\nlife about a sordid ambition.\"\n\n\"Sordid?\"\n\n\"Merely to make a living.\"\n\nMildred laughed merrily and mockingly.  \"You call that sordid?  Then\nfor heaven's sake what is high? You had left you money enough to live\non, if you have to.  No one left me an income.  So, I'm fighting for\nindependence--and that means for self-respect.  Is self-respect sordid,\nCyrilla!\"\n\nAnd then Cyrilla understood--in part, not altogether. She lived in the\nordinary environment of flap-doodle and sweet hypocrisy and\nsentimentality; and none such can more than vaguely glimpse the\nrealities.\n\nToward the end of the summer Moldini said:\n\n\"It's over.  You have won.\"\n\nMildred looked at him in puzzled surprise.\n\n\"You have learned it all.  You will succeed.  The rest is detail.\"\n\n\"But I've learned nothing as yet,\" protested she.\n\n\"You have learned to teach yourself,\" replied the Italian.  \"You at\nlast can hear yourself sing, and you know when you sing right and when\nyou sing wrong, and you know how to sing right.  The rest is easy. Ah,\nmy dear Miss Gower, you will work NOW!\"\n\nMildred did not understand.  She was even daunted by that \"You will\nwork NOW!\"  She had been thinking that to work harder was impossible.\nWhat did he expect of her?  Something she feared she could not realize.\nBut soon she understood--when he gave her songs, then began to teach\nher a role, the part of Madame Butterfly herself.  \"I can help you only\na little there,\" he said.  \"You will have to go to my friend Ferreri\nfor roles.  But we can make a beginning.\"\n\nShe had indeed won.  She had passed from the stage where a career is\nall drudgery--the stage through which only the strong can pass without\ngiving up and accepting failure or small success.  She had passed to\nthe stage where there is added pleasure to the drudgery, for, the\ndrudgery never ceases.  And what was the pleasure?  Why, more\nwork--always work--bringing into use not merely the routine parts of\nthe mind, but also the imaginative and creative faculties.  She had\nlearned her trade--not well enough, for no superior man or woman ever\nfeels that he or she knows the trade well enough--but well enough to\nbegin to use it.\n\nSaid Moldini:  \"When the great one, who has achieved and arrived, is\nasked for advice by the sweet, enthusiastic young beginner, what is the\nanswer? Always the same:  'My dear child, don't!  Go back home, and\nmarry and have babies.'  You know why now?\"\n\nAnd Mildred, looking back over the dreary drudgery that had been, and\nlooking forward to the drudgery yet to come, dreary enough for all the\nprospects of a few flowers and a little sun--Mildred said:  \"Indeed I\ndo, maestro.\"\n\n\"They think it means what you Americans call morals--as if that were\nall of morality!  But it doesn't mean morals; not at all.  Sex and the\ngame of sex is all through life everywhere--in the home no less than in\nthe theater.  In town and country, indoors and out, sunlight,\nmoonlight, and rain--always it goes on. And the temptations and the\nstruggles are no more and no less on the stage than off.  No, there is\ntoo much talk about 'morals.'  The reason the great one says 'don't' is\nthe work.\"  He shook his head sadly. \"They do not realize, those eager\nyoung beginners. They read the story-books and the lives of the great\nsuccesses and they hear the foolish chatter of common-place\npeople--those imbecile 'cultured' people who know nothing!  And they\nthink a career is a triumphal march.  What think you, Miss Gower--eh?\"\n\n\"If I had known I'd not have had the courage, or the vanity, to begin,\"\nsaid she.  \"And if I could realize what's before me, I probably\nshouldn't have the courage to go on.\"\n\n\"But why not?  Haven't you also learned that it's just the day's work,\ndoing every day the best you can?\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall go on,\" rejoined she.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, looking at her with awed admiration. \"It is in your\nface.  I saw it there, the day you came--after you sang the 'Batti\nBatti' the first time and failed.\"\n\n\"There was nothing to me then.\"\n\n\"The seed,\" replied he.  \"And I saw it was an acorn, not the seed of\none of those weak plants that spring up overnight and wither at noon.\nYes, you will win.\" He laughed gayly, rolled his eyes and kissed his\nfingers. \"And then you can afford to take a little holiday, and fall in\nlove.  Love!  Ah, it is a joyous pastime--for a holiday.  Only for a\nholiday, mind you.  I shall be there and I shall seize you and take you\nback to your art.\"\n\n\nIn the following winter and summer Crossley disclosed why he had been\nsufficiently interested in grand opera to begin to back undeveloped\nvoices.  Crossley was one of those men who are never so practical as\nwhen they profess to be, and fancy themselves, impractical. He became a\ngrand-opera manager and organized for a season that would surpass in\ninterest any New York had known.  Thus it came about that on a March\nnight Mildred made her debut.\n\nThe opera was \"Faust.\"  As the three principal men singers were all\nexpensive--the tenor alone, twelve hundred a night--Crossley put in a\ncomparatively modestly salaried Marguerite.  She was seized with a cold\nat the last moment, and Crossley ventured to substitute Mildred Gower.\nThe Rivi system was still in force.  She was ready--indeed, she was\nalways ready, as Rivi herself had been.  And within ten minutes of her\ncoming forth from the wings, Mildred Gower had leaped from obscurity\ninto fame.  It happens so, often in the story books, the newly\ngloriously arrived one having been wholly unprepared, achieving by\nsheer force of genius.  It occurs so, occasionally, in life--never when\nthere is lack of preparation, never by force of unassisted genius,\nnever by accident.  Mildred succeeded because she had got ready to\nsucceed.  How could she have failed?\n\nPerhaps you read the stories in the newspapers--how she had discovered\nherself possessed of a marvelous voice, how she had decided to use it\nin public, how she had coached for a part, had appeared, had become one\nof the world's few hundred great singers all in a single act of an\nopera.  You read nothing about what she went through in developing a\nhopelessly uncertain and far from strong voice into one which, while\nnot nearly so good as thousands of voices that are tried and cast\naside, yet sufficed, with her will and her concentration back of it, to\ncarry her to fame--and wealth.\n\nThat birdlike voice!  So sweet and spontaneous, so true, so like the\nbird that \"sings of summer in full throated ease!\"  No wonder the\naudience welcomed it with cheers on cheers.  Greater voices they had\nheard, but none more natural--and that was Moldini.\n\nHe came to her dressing-room at the intermission. He stretched out his\narms, but emotion overcame him, and he dropped to a chair and sobbed\nand cried and laughed.  She came and put her arms round him and kissed\nhim.  She was almost calm.  The GREAT fear had seized her--Can I keep\nwhat I have won?\n\n\"I am a fool,\" cried Moldini.  \"I will agitate you.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid of that,\" said she.  \"I am nervous, yes, horribly\nnervous.  But you have taught me so that I could sing, no matter what\nwas happening.\" It was true.  And her body was like iron to the touch.\n\nHe looked at her, and though he knew her and had seen her train herself\nand had helped in it, he marveled. \"You are happy?\" he said eagerly.\n\"Surely--yes, you MUST be happy.\"\n\n\"More than that,\" answered she.  \"You'll have to find another word than\nhappiness--something bigger and stronger and deeper.\"\n\n\"Now you can have your holiday,\" laughed he. \"But\"--with mock\nsternness--\"in moderation!  He must be an incident only.  With those\nwho win the high places, sex is an incident--a charming, necessary\nincident, but only an incident.  He must not spoil your career.  If you\nallowed that you would be like a mother who deserts her children for a\nlover.  He must not touch your career!\"\n\nMildred, giving the last touches to her costume before the glass,\nglanced merrily at Moldini by way of it. \"If he did touch it,\" said\nshe, \"how long do you think he would last with me?\"\n\nMoldini paused half-way in his nod of approval, was stricken with\nsilence and sadness.  It would have been natural and proper for a man\nthus to put sex beneath the career.  It was necessary for anyone who\ndeveloped the strong character that compels success and holds it. But--\nThe Italian could not get away from tradition; woman was made for the\npleasure of one man, not for herself and the world.\n\n\"You don't like that, maestro?\" said she, still observing him in the\nglass.\n\n\"No man would,\" said he, with returning cheerfulness.  \"It hurts man's\nvanity.  And no woman would, either; you rebuke their laziness and\ntheir dependence!\"\n\nShe laughed and rushed away to fresh triumphs.",
