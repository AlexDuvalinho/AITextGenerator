The nature and character of slavery have been subjects of an\nalmost endless variety of artistic representation; and after the\nbrilliant achievements in that field, and while those achievements are\nyet fresh in the memory of the million, he who would add another to the\nlegion, must possess the charm of transcendent excellence, or apologize\nfor something worse than rashness. The reader is, therefore, assured,\nwith all due promptitude, that his attention is not invited to a work of\nART, but to a work of FACTS--Facts, terrible and almost incredible, it\nmay be yet FACTS, nevertheless.\n\nI am authorized to say that there is not a fictitious name nor place\nin the whole volume; but that names and places are literally given, and\nthat every transaction therein described actually transpired.\n\nPerhaps the best Preface to this volume is furnished in the following\nletter of Mr. Douglass, written in answer to my urgent solicitation for\nsuch a work:\n\n                                ROCHESTER, N. Y. _July_ 2, 1855.\n\nDEAR FRIEND: I have long entertained, as you very well know, a somewhat\npositive repugnance to writing or speaking anything for the public,\nwhich could, with any degree of plausibilty, make me liable to the\nimputation of seeking personal notoriety, for its own sake. Entertaining\nthat feeling very sincerely, and permitting its control, perhaps, quite\nunreasonably, I have often{2} refused to narrate my personal experience\nin public anti-slavery meetings, and in sympathizing circles, when urged\nto do so by friends, with whose views and wishes, ordinarily, it were a\npleasure to comply. In my letters and speeches, I have generally\naimed to discuss the question of Slavery in the light of fundamental\nprinciples, and upon facts, notorious and open to all; making, I trust,\nno more of the fact of my own former enslavement, than circumstances\nseemed absolutely to require. I have never placed my opposition to\nslavery on a basis so narrow as my own enslavement, but rather upon the\nindestructible and unchangeable laws of human nature, every one of which\nis perpetually and flagrantly violated by the slave system. I have also\nfelt that it was best for those having histories worth the writing--or\nsupposed to be so--to commit such work to hands other than their own. To\nwrite of one’s self, in such a manner as not to incur the imputation of\nweakness, vanity, and egotism, is a work within the ability of but few;\nand I have little reason to believe that I belong to that fortunate few.\n\nThese considerations caused me to hesitate, when first you kindly urged\nme to prepare for publication a full account of my life as a slave, and\nmy life as a freeman.\n\nNevertheless, I see, with you, many reasons for regarding my\nautobiography as exceptional in its character, and as being, in some\nsense, naturally beyond the reach of those reproaches which honorable\nand sensitive minds dislike to incur. It is not to illustrate any heroic\nachievements of a man, but to vindicate a just and beneficent principle,\nin its application to the whole human family, by letting in the light of\ntruth upon a system, esteemed by some as a blessing, and by others as a\ncurse and a crime. I agree with you, that this system is now at the bar\nof public opinion--not only of this country, but of the whole civilized\nworld--for judgment. Its friends have made for it the usual plea--“not\nguilty;” the case must, therefore, proceed. Any facts, either from\nslaves, slaveholders, or by-standers, calculated to enlighten the public\nmind, by revealing the true nature, character, and tendency of the slave\nsystem, are in order, and can scarcely be innocently withheld.\n\nI see, too, that there are special reasons why I should write my own\nbiography, in preference to employing another to do it. Not only is\nslavery on trial, but unfortunately, the enslaved people are also on\ntrial. It is alleged, that they are, naturally, inferior; that they are\n_so low_ in the scale of humanity, and so utterly stupid, that they are\nunconscious of their wrongs, and do not apprehend their rights. Looking,\nthen, at your request, from this stand-point, and wishing everything of\nwhich you think me capable to go to the benefit of my afflicted people,\nI part with my doubts and hesitation, and proceed to furnish you\nthe desired manuscript; hoping that you may be able to make such\narrangements for its publication as shall be best adapted to accomplish\nthat good which you so enthusiastically anticipate.\n\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS\n{3}\n\nThere was little necessity for doubt and hesitation on the part of Mr.\nDouglass, as to the propriety of his giving to the world a full account\nof himself. A man who was born and brought up in slavery, a living\nwitness of its horrors; who often himself experienced its cruelties; and\nwho, despite the depressing influences surrounding his birth, youth and\nmanhood, has risen, from a dark and almost absolute obscurity, to the\ndistinguished position which he now occupies, might very well assume the\nexistence of a commendable curiosity, on the part of the public, to know\nthe facts of his remarkable history.\n\nEDITOR\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nWhen a man raises himself from the lowest condition in society to\nthe highest, mankind pay him the tribute of their admiration; when he\naccomplishes this elevation by native energy, guided by prudence and\nwisdom, their admiration is increased; but when his course, onward and\nupward, excellent in itself, furthermore proves a possible, what had\nhitherto been regarded as an impossible, reform, then he becomes a\nburning and a shining light, on which the aged may look with gladness,\nthe young with hope, and the down-trodden, as a representative of\nwhat they may themselves become. To such a man, dear reader, it is my\nprivilege to introduce you.\n\nThe life of Frederick Douglass, recorded in the pages which follow,\nis not merely an example of self-elevation under the most adverse\ncircumstances; it is, moreover, a noble vindication of the highest aims\nof the American anti-slavery movement. The real object of that movement\nis not only to disenthrall, it is, also, to bestow upon the Negro the\nexercise of all those rights, from the possession of which he has been\nso long debarred.\n\nBut this full recognition of the colored man to the right, and the\nentire admission of the same to the full privileges, political,\nreligious and social, of manhood, requires powerful effort on the part\nof the enthralled, as well as on the part of those who would disenthrall\nthem. The people at large must feel the conviction, as well as admit the\nabstract logic, of human equality;{5} the Negro, for the first time in\nthe world’s history, brought in full contact with high civilization,\nmust prove his title first to all that is demanded for him; in the teeth\nof unequal chances, he must prove himself equal to the mass of those who\noppress him--therefore, absolutely superior to his apparent fate, and\nto their relative ability. And it is most cheering to the friends of\nfreedom, today, that evidence of this equality is rapidly accumulating,\nnot from the ranks of the half-freed colored people of the free states,\nbut from the very depths of slavery itself; the indestructible equality\nof man to man is demonstrated by the ease with which black men, scarce\none remove from barbarism--if slavery can be honored with such a\ndistinction--vault into the high places of the most advanced and\npainfully acquired civilization. Ward and Garnett, Wells Brown and\nPennington, Loguen and Douglass, are banners on the outer wall, under\nwhich abolition is fighting its most successful battles, because\nthey are living exemplars of the practicability of the most radical\nabolitionism; for, they were all of them born to the doom of slavery,\nsome of them remained slaves until adult age, yet they all have not\nonly won equality to their white fellow citizens, in civil, religious,\npolitical and social rank, but they have also illustrated and adorned\nour common country by their genius, learning and eloquence.\n\nThe characteristics whereby Mr. Douglass has won first rank among these\nremarkable men, and is still rising toward highest rank among living\nAmericans, are abundantly laid bare in the book before us. Like the\nautobiography of Hugh Miller, it carries us so far back into early\nchildhood, as to throw light upon the question, “when positive and\npersistent memory begins in the human being.” And, like Hugh Miller, he\nmust have been a shy old-fashioned child, occasionally oppressed by what\nhe could not well account for, peering and poking about among the layers\nof right and wrong, of tyrant and thrall, and the wonderfulness of that\nhopeless tide of things which brought power to one race, and unrequited\ntoil to another, until, finally, he stumbled upon{6} his “first-found\nAmmonite,” hidden away down in the depths of his own nature, and which\nrevealed to him the fact that liberty and right, for all men, were\nanterior to slavery and wrong. When his knowledge of the world was\nbounded by the visible horizon on Col. Lloyd’s plantation, and while\nevery thing around him bore a fixed, iron stamp, as if it had always\nbeen so, this was, for one so young, a notable discovery.\n\nTo his uncommon memory, then, we must add a keen and accurate insight\ninto men and things; an original breadth of common sense which enabled\nhim to see, and weigh, and compare whatever passed before him, and\nwhich kindled a desire to search out and define their relations to other\nthings not so patent, but which never succumbed to the marvelous nor the\nsupernatural; a sacred thirst for liberty and for learning, first as a\nmeans of attaining liberty, then as an end in itself most desirable; a\nwill; an unfaltering energy and determination to obtain what his soul\npronounced desirable; a majestic self-hood; determined courage; a deep\nand agonizing sympathy with his embruted, crushed and bleeding fellow\nslaves, and an extraordinary depth of passion, together with that rare\nalliance between passion and intellect, which enables the former, when\ndeeply roused, to excite, develop and sustain the latter.\n\nWith these original gifts in view, let us look at his schooling; the\nfearful discipline through which it pleased God to prepare him for the\nhigh calling on which he has since entered--the advocacy of emancipation\nby the people who are not slaves. And for this special mission, his\nplantation education was better than any he could have acquired in any\nlettered school. What he needed, was facts and experiences, welded to\nacutely wrought up sympathies, and these he could not elsewhere have\nobtained, in a manner so peculiarly adapted to his nature. His physical\nbeing was well trained, also, running wild until advanced into boyhood;\nhard work and light diet, thereafter, and a skill in handicraft in\nyouth.{7}\n\nFor his special mission, then, this was, considered in connection with\nhis natural gifts, a good schooling; and, for his special mission,\nhe doubtless “left school” just at the proper moment. Had he remained\nlonger in slavery--had he fretted under bonds until the ripening of\nmanhood and its passions, until the drear agony of slave-wife and\nslave-children had been piled upon his already bitter experiences--then,\nnot only would his own history have had another termination, but the\ndrama of American slavery would have been essentially varied; for I\ncannot resist the belief, that the boy who learned to read and write as\nhe did, who taught his fellow slaves these precious acquirements as he\ndid, who plotted for their mutual escape as he did, would, when a man\nat bay, strike a blow which would make slavery reel and stagger.\nFurthermore, blows and insults he bore, at the moment, without\nresentment; deep but suppressed emotion rendered him insensible to\ntheir sting; but it was afterward, when the memory of them went\nseething through his brain, breeding a fiery indignation at his injured\nself-hood, that the resolve came to resist, and the time fixed when\nto resist, and the plot laid, how to resist; and he always kept his\nself-pledged word. In what he undertook, in this line, he looked fate\nin the face, and had a cool, keen look at the relation of means to ends.\nHenry Bibb, to avoid chastisement, strewed his master’s bed with charmed\nleaves and _was whipped_. Frederick Douglass quietly pocketed a like\n_fetiche_, compared his muscles with those of Covey--and _whipped him_.\n\nIn the history of his life in bondage, we find, well developed, that\ninherent and continuous energy of character which will ever render him\ndistinguished. What his hand found to do, he did with his might; even\nwhile conscious that he was wronged out of his daily earnings, he\nworked, and worked hard. At his daily labor he went with a will; with\nkeen, well set eye, brawny chest, lithe figure, and fair sweep of arm,\nhe would have been king among calkers, had that been his mission.\n\nIt must not be overlooked, in this glance at his education, that{8} Mr.\nDouglass lacked one aid to which so many men of mark have been deeply\nindebted--he had neither a mother’s care, nor a mother’s culture, save\nthat which slavery grudgingly meted out to him. Bitter nurse! may not\neven her features relax with human feeling, when she gazes at\nsuch offspring! How susceptible he was to the kindly influences of\nmother-culture, may be gathered from his own words, on page 57: “It\nhas been a life-long standing grief to me, that I know so little of my\nmother, and that I was so early separated from her. The counsels of\nher love must have been beneficial to me. The side view of her face is\nimaged on my memory, and I take few steps in life, without feeling her\npresence; but the image is mute, and I have no striking words of hers\ntreasured up.”\n\nFrom the depths of chattel slavery in Maryland, our author escaped into\nthe caste-slavery of the north, in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Here he\nfound oppression assuming another, and hardly less bitter, form; of\nthat very handicraft which the greed of slavery had taught him, his\nhalf-freedom denied him the exercise for an honest living; he found\nhimself one of a class--free colored men--whose position he has\ndescribed in the following words:\n\n“Aliens are we in our native land. The fundamental principles of\nthe republic, to which the humblest white man, whether born here or\nelsewhere, may appeal with confidence, in the hope of awakening a\nfavorable response, are held to be inapplicable to us. The glorious\ndoctrines of your revolutionary fathers, and the more glorious teachings\nof the Son of God, are construed and applied against us. We are\nliterally scourged beyond the beneficent range of both authorities,\nhuman and divine. * * * * American humanity hates us, scorns us, disowns\nand denies, in a thousand ways, our very personality. The outspread wing\nof American christianity, apparently broad enough to give shelter to a\nperishing world, refuses to cover us. To us, its bones are brass, and\nits features iron. In running thither for shelter and{9} succor, we\nhave only fled from the hungry blood-hound to the devouring wolf--from\na corrupt and selfish world, to a hollow and hypocritical\nchurch.”--_Speech before American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society,\nMay_, 1854.\n\nFour years or more, from 1837 to 1841, he struggled on, in New Bedford,\nsawing wood, rolling casks, or doing what labor he might, to support\nhimself and young family; four years he brooded over the scars which\nslavery and semi-slavery had inflicted upon his body and soul; and then,\nwith his wounds yet unhealed, he fell among the Garrisonians--a glorious\nwaif to those most ardent reformers. It happened one day, at Nantucket,\nthat he, diffidently and reluctantly, was led to address an anti-slavery\nmeeting. He was about the age when the younger Pitt entered the House of\nCommons; like Pitt, too, he stood up a born orator.\n\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, who was happily present, writes thus of Mr.\nDouglass’ maiden effort; “I shall never forget his first speech at the\nconvention--the extraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind--the\npowerful impression it created upon a crowded auditory, completely taken\nby surprise. * * * I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at\nthat moment; certainly, my perception of the enormous outrage which is\ninflicted by it on the godlike nature of its victims, was rendered\nfar more clear than ever. There stood one in physical proportions and\nstature commanding and exact--in intellect richly endowed--in natural\neloquence a prodigy.”\n [1]\n\nIt is of interest to compare Mr. Douglass’s account of this meeting with\nMr. Garrison’s. Of the two, I think the latter the most correct. It must\nhave been a grand burst of eloquence! The pent up agony, indignation and\npathos of an abused and harrowed boyhood and youth, bursting out in all\ntheir freshness and overwhelming earnestness!\n\nThis unique introduction to its great leader, led immediately{10} to\nthe employment of Mr. Douglass as an agent by the American Anti-Slavery\nSociety. So far as his self-relying and independent character would\npermit, he became, after the strictest sect, a Garrisonian. It is not\ntoo much to say, that he formed a complement which they needed, and they\nwere a complement equally necessary to his “make-up.” With his deep and\nkeen sensitiveness to wrong, and his wonderful memory, he came from the\nland of bondage full of its woes and its evils, and painting them in\ncharacters of living light; and, on his part, he found, told out in\nsound Saxon phrase, all those principles of justice and right and\nliberty, which had dimly brooded over the dreams of his youth, seeking\ndefinite forms and verbal expression. It must have been an electric\nflashing of thought, and a knitting of soul, granted to but few in this\nlife, and will be a life-long memory to those who participated in it. In\nthe society, moreover, of Wendell Phillips, Edmund Quincy, William\nLloyd Garrison, and other men of earnest faith and refined culture, Mr.\nDouglass enjoyed the high advantage of their assistance and counsel in\nthe labor of self-culture, to which he now addressed himself with wonted\nenergy. Yet, these gentlemen, although proud of Frederick Douglass,\nfailed to fathom, and bring out to the light of day, the highest\nqualities of his mind; the force of their own education stood in\ntheir own way: they did not delve into the mind of a colored man for\ncapacities which the pride of race led them to believe to be restricted\nto their own Saxon blood. Bitter and vindictive sarcasm, irresistible\nmimicry, and a pathetic narrative of his own experiences of slavery,\nwere the intellectual manifestations which they encouraged him to\nexhibit on the platform or in the lecture desk.\n\nA visit to England, in 1845, threw Mr. Douglass among men and women of\nearnest souls and high culture, and who, moreover, had never drank of\nthe bitter waters of American caste. For the first time in his life, he\nbreathed an atmosphere congenial to the longings of his spirit, and felt\nhis manhood free and{11} unrestricted. The cordial and manly greetings\nof the British and Irish audiences in public, and the refinement and\nelegance of the social circles in which he mingled, not only as an\nequal, but as a recognized man of genius, were, doubtless, genial and\npleasant resting places in his hitherto thorny and troubled journey\nthrough life. There are joys on the earth, and, to the wayfaring\nfugitive from American slavery or American caste, this is one of them.\n\nBut his sojourn in England was more than a joy to Mr. Douglass. Like\nthe platform at Nantucket, it awakened him to the consciousness of new\npowers that lay in him. From the pupilage of Garrisonism he rose to the\ndignity of a teacher and a thinker; his opinions on the broader aspects\nof the great American question were earnestly and incessantly sought,\nfrom various points of view, and he must, perforce, bestir himself to\ngive suitable answer. With that prompt and truthful perception which\nhas led their sisters in all ages of the world to gather at the feet\nand support the hands of reformers, the gentlewomen of England [2] were\nforemost to encourage and strengthen him to carve out for himself a path\nfitted to his powers and energies, in the life-battle against slavery\nand caste to which he was pledged. And one stirring thought, inseparable\nfrom the British idea of the evangel of freedom, must have smote his ear\nfrom every side--\n\n        _Hereditary bondmen! know ye not\n        Who would be free, themselves mast strike the blow?_\n\n\nThe result of this visit was, that on his return to the United States,\nhe established a newspaper. This proceeding was sorely against the\nwishes and the advice of the leaders of the American Anti-Slavery\nSociety, but our author had fully grown up to the conviction of a truth\nwhich they had once promulged, but now{12} forgotten, to wit: that in\ntheir own elevation--self-elevation--colored men have a blow to strike\n“on their own hook,” against slavery and caste. Differing from his\nBoston friends in this matter, diffident in his own abilities, reluctant\nat their dissuadings, how beautiful is the loyalty with which he still\nclung to their principles in all things else, and even in this.\n\nNow came the trial hour. Without cordial support from any large body of\nmen or party on this side the Atlantic, and too far distant in space and\nimmediate interest to expect much more, after the much already done,\non the other side, he stood up, almost alone, to the arduous labor and\nheavy expenditure of editor and lecturer. The Garrison party, to which\nhe still adhered, did not want a _colored_ newspaper--there was an odor\nof _caste_ about it; the Liberty party could hardly be expected to give\nwarm support to a man who smote their principles as with a hammer;\nand the wide gulf which separated the free colored people from the\nGarrisonians, also separated them from their brother, Frederick\nDouglass.\n\nThe arduous nature of his labors, from the date of the establishment of\nhis paper, may be estimated by the fact, that anti-slavery papers in the\nUnited States, even while organs of, and when supported by, anti-slavery\nparties, have, with a single exception, failed to pay expenses. Mr.\nDouglass has maintained, and does maintain, his paper without the\nsupport of any party, and even in the teeth of the opposition of those\nfrom whom he had reason to expect counsel and encouragement. He has been\ncompelled, at one and the same time, and almost constantly, during the\npast seven years, to contribute matter to its columns as editor, and\nto raise funds for its support as lecturer. It is within bounds to say,\nthat he has expended twelve thousand dollars of his own hard earned\nmoney, in publishing this paper, a larger sum than has been contributed\nby any one individual for the general advancement of the colored people.\nThere had been many other papers published and edited by colored men,\nbeginning as far back as{13} 1827, when the Rev. Samuel E. Cornish and\nJohn B. Russworm (a graduate of Bowdoin college, and afterward Governor\nof Cape Palmas) published the _Freedom’s Journal_, in New York City;\nprobably not less than one hundred newspaper enterprises have been\nstarted in the United States, by free colored men, born free, and some\nof them of liberal education and fair talents for this work; but, one\nafter another, they have fallen through, although, in several instances,\nanti-slavery friends contributed to their support. [3] It had almost\nbeen given up, as an impracticable thing, to maintain a colored\nnewspaper, when Mr. Douglass, with fewest early advantages of all his\ncompetitors, essayed, and has proved the thing perfectly practicable,\nand, moreover, of great public benefit. This paper, in addition to its\npower in holding up the hands of those to whom it is especially\ndevoted, also affords irrefutable evidence of the justice, safety and\npracticability of Immediate Emancipation; it further proves the immense\nloss which slavery inflicts on the land while it dooms such energies as\nhis to the hereditary degradation of slavery.\n\nIt has been said in this Introduction, that Mr. Douglass had raised\nhimself by his own efforts to the highest position in society. As a\nsuccessful editor, in our land, he occupies this position. Our editors\nrule the land, and he is one of them. As an orator and thinker, his\nposition is equally high, in the opinion of his countrymen. If a\nstranger in the United States would seek its most distinguished men--the\nmovers of public opinion--he will find their names mentioned, and their\nmovements chronicled, under the head of “BY MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH,” in the\ndaily papers. The keen caterers for the public attention, set down, in\nthis column, such men only as have won high mark in the public esteem.\nDuring the past winter--1854-5--very frequent mention of Frederick\nDouglass was made under this head in the daily papers; his name glided\nas often--this week from Chicago, next{14} week from Boston--over the\nlightning wires, as the name of any other man, of whatever note. To no\nman did the people more widely nor more earnestly say, _“Tell me thy\nthought!”_ And, somehow or other, revolution seemed to follow in his\nwake. His were not the mere words of eloquence which Kossuth speaks\nof, that delight the ear and then pass away. No! They were _work_-able,\n_do_-able words, that brought forth fruits in the revolution in\nIllinois, and in the passage of the franchise resolutions by the\nAssembly of New York.\n\nAnd the secret of his power, what is it? He is a Representative American\nman--a type of his countrymen. Naturalists tell us that a full grown man\nis a resultant or representative of all animated nature on this globe;\nbeginning with the early embryo state, then representing the lowest\nforms of organic life, [4] and passing through every subordinate grade\nor type, until he reaches the last and highest--manhood. In like manner,\nand to the fullest extent, has Frederick Douglass passed through every\ngradation of rank comprised in our national make-up, and bears upon his\nperson and upon his soul every thing that is American. And he has not\nonly full sympathy with every thing American; his proclivity or bent,\nto active toil and visible progress, are in the strictly national\ndirection, delighting to outstrip “all creation.”\n\nNor have the natural gifts, already named as his, lost anything by his\nsevere training. When unexcited, his mental processes are probably slow,\nbut singularly clear in perception, and wide in vision, the unfailing\nmemory bringing up all the facts in their every aspect; incongruities\nhe lays hold of incontinently, and holds up on the edge of his keen and\ntelling wit. But this wit never descends to frivolity; it is rigidly\nin the keeping of his truthful common sense, and always used in\nillustration or proof of some point which could not so readily be\nreached any other way. “Beware of a Yankee when he is feeding,” is a\nshaft that strikes home{15} in a matter never so laid bare by satire\nbefore. “The Garrisonian views of disunion, if carried to a successful\nissue, would only place the people of the north in the same relation\nto American slavery which they now bear to the slavery of Cuba or the\nBrazils,” is a statement, in a few words, which contains the result and\nthe evidence of an argument which might cover pages, but could not carry\nstronger conviction, nor be stated in less pregnable form. In proof\nof this, I may say, that having been submitted to the attention of the\nGarrisonians in print, in March, it was repeated before them at their\nbusiness meeting in May--the platform, _par excellence_, on which they\ninvite free fight, _a l’outrance_, to all comers. It was given out in\nthe clear, ringing tones, wherewith the hall of shields was wont to\nresound of old, yet neither Garrison, nor Phillips, nor May, nor Remond,\nnor Foster, nor Burleigh, with his subtle steel of “the ice brook’s\ntemper,” ventured to break a lance upon it! The doctrine of the\ndissolution of the Union, as a means for the abolition of American\nslavery, was silenced upon the lips that gave it birth, and in the\npresence of an array of defenders who compose the keenest intellects in\nthe land.\n\n_“The man who is right is a majority”_ is an aphorism struck out by\nMr. Douglass in that great gathering of the friends of freedom, at\nPittsburgh, in 1852, where he towered among the highest, because, with\nabilities inferior to none, and moved more deeply than any, there was\nneither policy nor party to trammel the outpourings of his soul. Thus\nwe find, opposed to all disadvantages which a black man in the United\nStates labors and struggles under, is this one vantage ground--when the\nchance comes, and the audience where he may have a say, he stands forth\nthe freest, most deeply moved and most earnest of all men.\n\nIt has been said of Mr. Douglass, that his descriptive and declamatory\npowers, admitted to be of the very highest order, take precedence of\nhis logical force. Whilst the schools might have trained him to\nthe exhibition of the formulas of deductive{16} logic, nature and\ncircumstances forced him into the exercise of the higher faculties\nrequired by induction. The first ninety pages of this “Life in Bondage,”\n afford specimens of observing, comparing, and careful classifying,\nof such superior character, that it is difficult to believe them the\nresults of a child’s thinking; he questions the earth, and the children\nand the slaves around him again and again, and finally looks to _“God in\nthe sky”_ for the why and the wherefore of the unnatural thing, slavery.\n_“Yes, if indeed thou art, wherefore dost thou suffer us to be slain?”_\nis the only prayer and worship of the God-forsaken Dodos in the heart of\nAfrica. Almost the same was his prayer. One of his earliest observations\nwas that white children should know their ages, while the colored\nchildren were ignorant of theirs; and the songs of the slaves grated on\nhis inmost soul, because a something told him that harmony in sound, and\nmusic of the spirit, could not consociate with miserable degradation.\n\nTo such a mind, the ordinary processes of logical deduction are like\nproving that two and two make four. Mastering the intermediate steps\nby an intuitive glance, or recurring to them as Ferguson resorted to\ngeometry, it goes down to the deeper relation of things, and brings out\nwhat may seem, to some, mere statements, but which are new and brilliant\ngeneralizations, each resting on a broad and stable basis. Thus, Chief\nJustice Marshall gave his decisions, and then told Brother Story to look\nup the authorities--and they never differed from him. Thus, also, in his\n“Lecture on the Anti-Slavery Movement,” delivered before the Rochester\nLadies’ Anti-Slavery Society, Mr. Douglass presents a mass of thought,\nwhich, without any showy display of logic on his part, requires an\nexercise of the reasoning faculties of the reader to keep pace with him.\nAnd his “Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered,” is full of new\nand fresh thoughts on the dawning science of race-history.\n\nIf, as has been stated, his intellection is slow, when unexcited, it is\nmost prompt and rapid when he is thoroughly aroused.{17} Memory, logic,\nwit, sarcasm, invective pathos and bold imagery of rare structural\nbeauty, well up as from a copious fountain, yet each in its proper\nplace, and contributing to form a whole, grand in itself, yet complete\nin the minutest proportions. It is most difficult to hedge him in a\ncorner, for his positions are taken so deliberately, that it is rare to\nfind a point in them undefended aforethought. Professor Reason tells me\nthe following: “On a recent visit of a public nature, to Philadelphia,\nand in a meeting composed mostly of his colored brethren, Mr. Douglass\nproposed a comparison of views in the matters of the relations and\nduties of ‘our people;’ he holding that prejudice was the result\nof condition, and could be conquered by the efforts of the degraded\nthemselves. A gentleman present, distinguished for logical acumen and\nsubtlety, and who had devoted no small portion of the last twenty-five\nyears to the study and elucidation of this very question, held the\nopposite view, that prejudice is innate and unconquerable. He terminated\na series of well dove-tailed, Socratic questions to Mr. Douglass,\nwith the following: ‘If the legislature at Harrisburgh should awaken,\nto-morrow morning, and find each man’s skin turned black and his hair\nwoolly, what could they do to remove prejudice?’ ‘Immediately pass laws\nentitling black men to all civil, political and social privileges,’ was\nthe instant reply--and the questioning ceased.”\n\nThe most remarkable mental phenomenon in Mr. Douglass, is his style in\nwriting and speaking. In March, 1855, he delivered an address in the\nassembly chamber before the members of the legislature of the state of\nNew York. An eye witness [5] describes the crowded and most intelligent\naudience, and their rapt attention to the speaker, as the grandest scene\nhe ever witnessed in the capitol. Among those whose eyes were riveted on\nthe speaker full two hours and a half, were Thurlow Weed and Lieutenant\nGovernor Raymond; the latter, at the conclusion of the address,\nexclaimed to a friend, “I would give twenty thousand dollars,{18} if I\ncould deliver that address in that manner.” Mr. Raymond is a first class\ngraduate of Dartmouth, a rising politician, ranking foremost in the\nlegislature; of course, his ideal of oratory must be of the most\npolished and finished description.\n\nThe style of Mr. Douglass in writing, is to me an intellectual puzzle.\nThe strength, affluence and terseness may easily be accounted for,\nbecause the style of a man is the man; but how are we to account\nfor that rare polish in his style of writing, which, most critically\nexamined, seems the result of careful early culture among the best\nclassics of our language; it equals if it does not surpass the style of\nHugh Miller, which was the wonder of the British literary public, until\nhe unraveled the mystery in the most interesting of autobiographies. But\nFrederick Douglass was still calking the seams of Baltimore clippers,\nand had only written a “pass,” at the age when Miller’s style was\nalready formed.\n\nI asked William Whipper, of Pennsylvania, the gentleman alluded to\nabove, whether he thought Mr. Douglass’s power inherited from the\nNegroid, or from what is called the Caucasian side of his make up? After\nsome reflection, he frankly answered, “I must admit, although sorry to\ndo so, that the Caucasian predominates.” At that time, I almost agreed\nwith him; but, facts narrated in the first part of this work, throw a\ndifferent light on this interesting question.\n\nWe are left in the dark as to who was the paternal ancestor of our\nauthor; a fact which generally holds good of the Romuluses and Remuses\nwho are to inaugurate the new birth of our republic. In the absence of\ntestimony from the Caucasian side, we must see what evidence is given on\nthe other side of the house.\n\n“My grandmother, though advanced in years, * * * was yet a woman of\npower and spirit. She was marvelously straight in figure, elastic and\nmuscular.” (p. 46.)\n\nAfter describing her skill in constructing nets, her perseverance in\nusing them, and her wide-spread fame in the agricultural way he adds,\n“It happened to her--as it will happen to any careful{19} and thrifty\nperson residing in an ignorant and improvident neighborhood--to enjoy\nthe reputation of being born to good luck.” And his grandmother was a\nblack woman.\n\n“My mother was tall, and finely proportioned; of deep black, glossy\ncomplexion; had regular features; and among other slaves was remarkably\nsedate in her manners.” “Being a field hand, she was obliged to walk\ntwelve miles and return, between nightfall and daybreak, to see her\nchildren” (p. 54.) “I shall never forget the indescribable expression of\nher countenance when I told her that I had had no food since morning.\n* * * There was pity in her glance at me, and a fiery indignation at Aunt\nKaty at the same time; * * * * she read Aunt Katy a lecture which she\nnever forgot.” (p. 56.) “I learned after my mother’s death, that she\ncould read, and that she was the _only_ one of all the slaves and\ncolored people in Tuckahoe who enjoyed that advantage. How she acquired\nthis knowledge, I know not, for Tuckahoe is the last place in the world\nwhere she would be apt to find facilities for learning.” (p. 57.) “There\nis, in _Prichard’s Natural History of Man_, the head of a figure--on\npage 157--the features of which so resemble those of my mother, that I\noften recur to it with something of the feeling which I suppose others\nexperience when looking upon the pictures of dear departed ones.” (p.\n52.)\n\nThe head alluded to is copied from the statue of Ramses the Great, an\nEgyptian king of the nineteenth dynasty. The authors of the _Types of\nMankind_ give a side view of the same on page 148, remarking that the\nprofile, “like Napoleon’s, is superbly European!” The nearness of its\nresemblance to Mr. Douglass’ mother rests upon the evidence of his\nmemory, and judging from his almost marvelous feats of recollection\nof forms and outlines recorded in this book, this testimony may be\nadmitted.\n\nThese facts show that for his energy, perseverance, eloquence,\ninvective, sagacity, and wide sympathy, he is indebted to his Negro\nblood. The very marvel of his style would seem to be a development of\nthat other marvel--how his mother learned to read.{20} The versatility\nof talent which he wields, in common with Dumas, Ira Aldridge, and\nMiss Greenfield, would seem to be the result of the grafting of the\nAnglo-Saxon on good, original, Negro stock. If the friends of “Caucasus”\n choose to claim, for that region, what remains after this analysis--to\nwit: combination--they are welcome to it. They will forgive me for\nreminding them that the term “Caucasian” is dropped by recent writers on\nEthnology; for the people about Mount Caucasus, are, and have ever been,\nMongols. The great “white race” now seek paternity, according to Dr.\nPickering, in Arabia--“Arida Nutrix” of the best breed of horses &c.\nKeep on, gentlemen; you will find yourselves in Africa, by-and-by. The\nEgyptians, like the Americans, were a _mixed race_, with some Negro\nblood circling around the throne, as well as in the mud hovels.\n\nThis is the proper place to remark of our author, that the same strong\nself-hood, which led him to measure strength with Mr. Covey, and to\nwrench himself from the embrace of the Garrisonians, and which has borne\nhim through many resistances to the personal indignities offered him as\na colored man, sometimes becomes a hyper-sensitiveness to such assaults\nas men of his mark will meet with, on paper. Keen and unscrupulous\nopponents have sought, and not unsuccessfully, to pierce him in this\ndirection; for well they know, that if assailed, he will smite back.\n\nIt is not without a feeling of pride, dear reader, that I present you\nwith this book. The son of a self-emancipated bond-woman, I feel joy in\nintroducing to you my brother, who has rent his own bonds, and who, in\nhis every relation--as a public man, as a husband and as a father--is\nsuch as does honor to the land which gave him birth. I shall place this\nbook in the hands of the only child spared me, bidding him to strive and\nemulate its noble example. You may do likewise. It is an American book,\nfor Americans, in the fullest sense of the idea. It shows that the\nworst of our institutions, in its worst aspect, cannot keep down energy,\ntruthfulness, and earnest struggle for the right. It proves the{21}\njustice and practicability of Immediate Emancipation. It shows that any\nman in our land, “no matter in what battle his liberty may have been\ncloven down, * * * * no matter what complexion an Indian or an African\nsun may have burned upon him,” not only may “stand forth redeemed\nand disenthralled,” but may also stand up a candidate for the highest\nsuffrage of a great people--the tribute of their honest, hearty\nadmiration. Reader, _Vale! New York_\n\nJAMES M’CUNE SMITH\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. _Childhood_\n\nPLACE OF BIRTH--CHARACTER OF THE DISTRICT--TUCKAHOE--ORIGIN OF THE\nNAME--CHOPTANK RIVER--TIME OF BIRTH--GENEALOGICAL TREES--MODE OF\nCOUNTING TIME--NAMES OF GRANDPARENTS--THEIR POSITION--GRANDMOTHER\nESPECIALLY ESTEEMED--“BORN TO GOOD LUCK”--SWEET\nPOTATOES--SUPERSTITION--THE LOG CABIN--ITS CHARMS--SEPARATING\nCHILDREN--MY AUNTS--THEIR NAMES--FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF BEING A SLAVE--OLD\nMASTER--GRIEFS AND JOYS OF CHILDHOOD--COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS OF THE\nSLAVE-BOY AND THE SON OF A SLAVEHOLDER.\n\n\nIn Talbot county, Eastern Shore, Maryland, near Easton, the county town\nof that county, there is a small district of country, thinly populated,\nand remarkable for nothing that I know of more than for the worn-out,\nsandy, desert-like appearance of its soil, the general dilapidation\nof its farms and fences, the indigent and spiritless character of its\ninhabitants, and the prevalence of ague and fever.\n\nThe name of this singularly unpromising and truly famine stricken\ndistrict is Tuckahoe, a name well known to all Marylanders, black and\nwhite. It was given to this section of country probably, at the first,\nmerely in derision; or it may possibly have been applied to it, as I\nhave heard, because some one of its earlier inhabitants had been guilty\nof the petty meanness of stealing a hoe--or taking a hoe that did not\nbelong to him. Eastern Shore men usually pronounce the word _took_, as\n_tuck; Took-a-hoe_, therefore, is, in Maryland parlance, _Tuckahoe_.\nBut, whatever may have been its origin--and about this I will not be\n{26} positive--that name has stuck to the district in question; and it\nis seldom mentioned but with contempt and derision, on account of the\nbarrenness of its soil, and the ignorance, indolence, and poverty of its\npeople. Decay and ruin are everywhere visible, and the thin population\nof the place would have quitted it long ago, but for the Choptank\nriver, which runs through it, from which they take abundance of shad and\nherring, and plenty of ague and fever.\n\nIt was in this dull, flat, and unthrifty district, or neighborhood,\nsurrounded by a white population of the lowest order, indolent and\ndrunken to a proverb, and among slaves, who seemed to ask, _“Oh! what’s\nthe use?”_ every time they lifted a hoe, that I--without any fault of\nmine was born, and spent the first years of my childhood.\n\nThe reader will pardon so much about the place of my birth, on the score\nthat it is always a fact of some importance to know where a man is born,\nif, indeed, it be important to know anything about him. In regard to the\n_time_ of my birth, I cannot be as definite as I have been respecting\nthe _place_. Nor, indeed, can I impart much knowledge concerning my\nparents. Genealogical trees do not flourish among slaves. A person of\nsome consequence here in the north, sometimes designated _father_, is\nliterally abolished in slave law and slave practice. It is only once in\na while that an exception is found to this statement. I never met with a\nslave who could tell me how old he was. Few slave-mothers know anything\nof the months of the year, nor of the days of the month. They keep no\nfamily records, with marriages, births, and deaths. They measure the\nages of their children by spring time, winter time, harvest time,\nplanting time, and the like; but these soon become undistinguishable\nand forgotten. Like other slaves, I cannot tell how old I am. This\ndestitution was among my earliest troubles. I learned when I grew up,\nthat my master--and this is the case with masters generally--allowed\nno questions to be put to him, by which a slave might learn his{27\nGRANDPARENTS} age. Such questions deemed evidence of impatience, and\neven of impudent curiosity. From certain events, however, the dates of\nwhich I have since learned, I suppose myself to have been born about the\nyear 1817.\n\nThe first experience of life with me that I now remember--and I remember\nit but hazily--began in the family of my grandmother and grandfather.\nBetsey and Isaac Baily. They were quite advanced in life, and had long\nlived on the spot where they then resided. They were considered old\nsettlers in the neighborhood, and, from certain circumstances, I infer\nthat my grandmother, especially, was held in high esteem, far higher\nthan is the lot of most colored persons in the slave states. She was\na good nurse, and a capital hand at making nets for catching shad and\nherring; and these nets were in great demand, not only in Tuckahoe, but\nat Denton and Hillsboro, neighboring villages. She was not only good at\nmaking the nets, but was also somewhat famous for her good fortune in\ntaking the fishes referred to. I have known her to be in the water\nhalf the day. Grandmother was likewise more provident than most of\nher neighbors in the preservation of seedling sweet potatoes, and it\nhappened to her--as it will happen to any careful and thrifty person\nresiding in an ignorant and improvident community--to enjoy the\nreputation of having been born to “good luck.” Her “good luck” was owing\nto the exceeding care which she took in preventing the succulent root\nfrom getting bruised in the digging, and in placing it beyond the reach\nof frost, by actually burying it under the hearth of her cabin during\nthe winter months. In the time of planting sweet potatoes, “Grandmother\nBetty,” as she was familiarly called, was sent for in all directions,\nsimply to place the seedling potatoes in the hills; for superstition had\nit, that if “Grandmamma Betty but touches them at planting, they will be\nsure to grow and flourish.” This high reputation was full of advantage\nto her, and to the children around her. Though Tuckahoe had but few of\nthe good things of{28} life, yet of such as it did possess grandmother\ngot a full share, in the way of presents. If good potato crops came\nafter her planting, she was not forgotten by those for whom she planted;\nand as she was remembered by others, so she remembered the hungry little\nones around her.\n\nThe dwelling of my grandmother and grandfather had few pretensions. It\nwas a log hut, or cabin, built of clay, wood, and straw. At a\ndistance it resembled--though it was smaller, less commodious and less\nsubstantial--the cabins erected in the western states by the first\nsettlers. To my child’s eye, however, it was a noble structure,\nadmirably adapted to promote the comforts and conveniences of its\ninmates. A few rough, Virginia fence-rails, flung loosely over the\nrafters above, answered the triple purpose of floors, ceilings, and\nbedsteads. To be sure, this upper apartment was reached only by a\nladder--but what in the world for climbing could be better than a\nladder? To me, this ladder was really a high invention, and possessed\na sort of charm as I played with delight upon the rounds of it. In this\nlittle hut there was a large family of children: I dare not say how\nmany. My grandmother--whether because too old for field service, or\nbecause she had so faithfully discharged the duties of her station in\nearly life, I know not--enjoyed the high privilege of living in a cabin,\nseparate from the quarter, with no other burden than her own support,\nand the necessary care of the little children, imposed. She evidently\nesteemed it a great fortune to live so. The children were not her own,\nbut her grandchildren--the children of her daughters. She took delight\nin having them around her, and in attending to their few wants. The\npractice of separating children from their mother, and hiring the latter\nout at distances too great to admit of their meeting, except at long\nintervals, is a marked feature of the cruelty and barbarity of the\nslave system. But it is in harmony with the grand aim of slavery, which,\nalways and everywhere, is to reduce man to a level with the brute. It is\na successful method of obliterating{29 “OLD MASTER”} from the mind and\nheart of the slave, all just ideas of the sacredness of _the family_, as\nan institution.\n\nMost of the children, however, in this instance, being the children of\nmy grandmother’s daughters, the notions of family, and the reciprocal\nduties and benefits of the relation, had a better chance of being\nunderstood than where children are placed--as they often are in the\nhands of strangers, who have no care for them, apart from the wishes\nof their masters. The daughters of my grandmother were five in number.\nTheir names were JENNY, ESTHER, MILLY, PRISCILLA, and HARRIET. The\ndaughter last named was my mother, of whom the reader shall learn more\nby-and-by.\n\nLiving here, with my dear old grandmother and grandfather, it was a\nlong time before I knew myself to be _a slave_. I knew many other things\nbefore I knew that. Grandmother and grandfather were the greatest people\nin the world to me; and being with them so snugly in their own little\ncabin--I supposed it be their own--knowing no higher authority over me\nor the other children than the authority of grandmamma, for a time there\nwas nothing to disturb me; but, as I grew larger and older, I learned\nby degrees the sad fact, that the “little hut,” and the lot on which it\nstood, belonged not to my dear old grandparents, but to some person who\nlived a great distance off, and who was called, by grandmother, “OLD\nMASTER.” I further learned the sadder fact, that not only the house and\nlot, but that grandmother herself, (grandfather was free,) and all\nthe little children around her, belonged to this mysterious personage,\ncalled by grandmother, with every mark of reverence, “Old Master.” Thus\nearly did clouds and shadows begin to fall upon my path. Once on the\ntrack--troubles never come singly--I was not long in finding out another\nfact, still more grievous to my childish heart. I was told that this\n“old master,” whose name seemed ever to be mentioned with fear and\nshuddering, only allowed the children to live with grandmother for a\nlimited time, and that in fact as soon{30} as they were big enough, they\nwere promptly taken away, to live with the said “old master.” These\nwere distressing revelations indeed; and though I was quite too young\nto comprehend the full import of the intelligence, and mostly spent my\nchildhood days in gleesome sports with the other children, a shade of\ndisquiet rested upon me.\n\nThe absolute power of this distant “old master” had touched my young\nspirit with but the point of its cold, cruel iron, and left me something\nto brood over after the play and in moments of repose. Grandmammy was,\nindeed, at that time, all the world to me; and the thought of being\nseparated from her, in any considerable time, was more than an unwelcome\nintruder. It was intolerable.\n\nChildren have their sorrows as well as men and women; and it would be\nwell to remember this in our dealings with them. SLAVE-children _are_\nchildren, and prove no exceptions to the general rule. The liability\nto be separated from my grandmother, seldom or never to see her again,\nhaunted me. I dreaded the thought of going to live with that mysterious\n“old master,” whose name I never heard mentioned with affection, but\nalways with fear. I look back to this as among the heaviest of my\nchildhood’s sorrows. My grandmother! my grandmother! and the little hut,\nand the joyous circle under her care, but especially _she_, who made\nus sorry when she left us but for an hour, and glad on her return,--how\ncould I leave her and the good old home?\n\nBut the sorrows of childhood, like the pleasures of after life,\nare transient. It is not even within the power of slavery to write\n_indelible_ sorrow, at a single dash, over the heart of a child.\n\n                _The tear down childhood’s cheek that flows,\n                Is like the dew-drop on the rose--\n                When next the summer breeze comes by,\n                And waves the bush--the flower is dry_.\n\n\nThere is, after all, but little difference in the measure of contentment\nfelt by the slave-child neglected and the slaveholder’s{31 COMPARATIVE\nHAPPINESS} child cared for and petted. The spirit of the All Just\nmercifully holds the balance for the young.\n\nThe slaveholder, having nothing to fear from impotent childhood, easily\naffords to refrain from cruel inflictions; and if cold and hunger do\nnot pierce the tender frame, the first seven or eight years of the\nslave-boy’s life are about as full of sweet content as those of the most\nfavored and petted _white_ children of the slaveholder. The slave-boy\nescapes many troubles which befall and vex his white brother. He seldom\nhas to listen to lectures on propriety of behavior, or on anything else.\nHe is never chided for handling his little knife and fork improperly\nor awkwardly, for he uses none. He is never reprimanded for soiling the\ntable-cloth, for he takes his meals on the clay floor. He never has the\nmisfortune, in his games or sports, of soiling or tearing his clothes,\nfor he has almost none to soil or tear. He is never expected to act like\na nice little gentleman, for he is only a rude little slave. Thus, freed\nfrom all restraint, the slave-boy can be, in his life and conduct, a\ngenuine boy, doing whatever his boyish nature suggests; enacting, by\nturns, all the strange antics and freaks of horses, dogs, pigs, and\nbarn-door fowls, without in any manner compromising his dignity, or\nincurring reproach of any sort. He literally runs wild; has no pretty\nlittle verses to learn in the nursery; no nice little speeches to make\nfor aunts, uncles, or cousins, to show how smart he is; and, if he can\nonly manage to keep out of the way of the heavy feet and fists of the\nolder slave boys, he may trot on, in his joyous and roguish tricks, as\nhappy as any little heathen under the palm trees of Africa. To be\nsure, he is occasionally reminded, when he stumbles in the path of his\nmaster--and this he early learns to avoid--that he is eating his _“white\nbread,”_ and that he will be made to _“see sights”_ by-and-by. The\nthreat is soon forgotten; the shadow soon passes, and our sable boy\ncontinues to roll in the dust, or play in the mud, as bests suits him,\nand in the veriest freedom. If he feels uncomfortable, from mud or from\ndust, the coast is clear; he can plunge into{32} the river or the pond,\nwithout the ceremony of undressing, or the fear of wetting his clothes;\nhis little tow-linen shirt--for that is all he has on--is easily dried;\nand it needed ablution as much as did his skin. His food is of the\ncoarsest kind, consisting for the most part of cornmeal mush, which\noften finds it way from the wooden tray to his mouth in an oyster shell.\nHis days, when the weather is warm, are spent in the pure, open air, and\nin the bright sunshine. He always sleeps in airy apartments; he seldom\nhas to take powders, or to be paid to swallow pretty little sugar-coated\npills, to cleanse his blood, or to quicken his appetite. He eats no\ncandies; gets no lumps of loaf sugar; always relishes his food; cries\nbut little, for nobody cares for his crying; learns to esteem his\nbruises but slight, because others so esteem them. In a word, he is, for\nthe most part of the first eight years of his life, a spirited, joyous,\nuproarious, and happy boy, upon whom troubles fall only like water on a\nduck’s back. And such a boy, so far as I can now remember, was the boy\nwhose life in slavery I am now narrating.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. _Removed from My First Home_\n\nTHE NAME “OLD MASTER” A TERROR--COLONEL LLOYD’S PLANTATION--WYE\nRIVER--WHENCE ITS NAME--POSITION OF THE LLOYDS--HOME ATTRACTION--MEET\nOFFERING--JOURNEY FROM TUCKAHOE TO WYE RIVER--SCENE ON REACHING OLD\nMASTER’S--DEPARTURE OF GRANDMOTHER--STRANGE MEETING OF SISTERS AND\nBROTHERS--REFUSAL TO BE COMFORTED--SWEET SLEEP.\n\n\nThat mysterious individual referred to in the first chapter as an object\nof terror among the inhabitants of our little cabin, under the ominous\ntitle of “old master,” was really a man of some consequence. He owned\nseveral farms in Tuckahoe; was the chief clerk and butler on the home\nplantation of Col. Edward Lloyd; had overseers on his own farms; and\ngave directions to overseers on the farms belonging to Col. Lloyd.\nThis plantation is situated on Wye river--the river receiving its name,\ndoubtless, from Wales, where the Lloyds originated. They (the Lloyds)\nare an old and honored family in Maryland, exceedingly wealthy. The home\nplantation, where they have resided, perhaps for a century or more, is\none of the largest, most fertile, and best appointed, in the state.\n\nAbout this plantation, and about that queer old master--who must be\nsomething more than a man, and something worse than an angel--the reader\nwill easily imagine that I was not only curious, but eager, to know all\nthat could be known. Unhappily for me, however, all the information\nI could get concerning him increased my great dread of being carried\nthither--of being{34} separated from and deprived of the protection of\nmy grandmother and grandfather. It was, evidently, a great thing to go\nto Col. Lloyd’s; and I was not without a little curiosity to see the\nplace; but no amount of coaxing could induce in me the wish to remain\nthere. The fact is, such was my dread of leaving the little cabin, that\nI wished to remain little forever, for I knew the taller I grew the\nshorter my stay. The old cabin, with its rail floor and rail bedsteads\nupstairs, and its clay floor downstairs, and its dirt chimney, and\nwindowless sides, and that most curious piece of workmanship dug in\nfront of the fireplace, beneath which grandmammy placed the sweet\npotatoes to keep them from the frost, was MY HOME--the only home I ever\nhad; and I loved it, and all connected with it. The old fences around\nit, and the stumps in the edge of the woods near it, and the squirrels\nthat ran, skipped, and played upon them, were objects of interest and\naffection. There, too, right at the side of the hut, stood the old well,\nwith its stately and skyward-pointing beam, so aptly placed between the\nlimbs of what had once been a tree, and so nicely balanced that I could\nmove it up and down with only one hand, and could get a drink myself\nwithout calling for help. Where else in the world could such a well be\nfound, and where could such another home be met with? Nor were these\nall the attractions of the place. Down in a little valley, not far from\ngrandmammy’s cabin, stood Mr. Lee’s mill, where the people came often in\nlarge numbers to get their corn ground. It was a watermill; and I never\nshall be able to tell the many things thought and felt, while I sat on\nthe bank and watched that mill, and the turning of that ponderous wheel.\nThe mill-pond, too, had its charms; and with my pinhook, and thread\nline, I could get _nibbles_, if I could catch no fish. But, in all my\nsports and plays, and in spite of them, there would, occasionally, come\nthe painful foreboding that I was not long to remain there, and that I\nmust soon be called away to the home of old master.\n\nI was A SLAVE--born a slave and though the fact was in{35 DEPARTURE FROM\nTUCKAHOE} comprehensible to me, it conveyed to my mind a sense of my\nentire dependence on the will of _somebody_ I had never seen; and, from\nsome cause or other, I had been made to fear this somebody above all\nelse on earth. Born for another’s benefit, as the _firstling_ of the\ncabin flock I was soon to be selected as a meet offering to the fearful\nand inexorable _demigod_, whose huge image on so many occasions haunted\nmy childhood’s imagination. When the time of my departure was decided\nupon, my grandmother, knowing my fears, and in pity for them, kindly\nkept me ignorant of the dreaded event about to transpire. Up to the\nmorning (a beautiful summer morning) when we were to start, and, indeed,\nduring the whole journey--a journey which, child as I was, I remember as\nwell as if it were yesterday--she kept the sad fact hidden from me. This\nreserve was necessary; for, could I have known all, I should have\ngiven grandmother some trouble in getting me started. As it was, I was\nhelpless, and she--dear woman!--led me along by the hand, resisting,\nwith the reserve and solemnity of a priestess, all my inquiring looks to\nthe last.\n\nThe distance from Tuckahoe to Wye river--where my old master lived--was\nfull twelve miles, and the walk was quite a severe test of the endurance\nof my young legs. The journey would have proved too severe for me,\nbut that my dear old grandmother--blessings on her memory!--afforded\noccasional relief by “toting” me (as Marylanders have it) on her\nshoulder. My grandmother, though advanced in years--as was evident\nfrom more than one gray hair, which peeped from between the ample and\ngraceful folds of her newly-ironed bandana turban--was yet a woman of\npower and spirit. She was marvelously straight in figure, elastic, and\nmuscular. I seemed hardly to be a burden to her. She would have “toted”\n me farther, but that I felt myself too much of a man to allow it, and\ninsisted on walking. Releasing dear grandmamma from carrying me, did not\nmake me altogether independent of her, when we happened to pass through\nportions of the somber woods which lay between Tuckahoe and{36} Wye\nriver. She often found me increasing the energy of my grip, and holding\nher clothing, lest something should come out of the woods and eat me up.\nSeveral old logs and stumps imposed upon me, and got themselves taken\nfor wild beasts. I could see their legs, eyes, and ears, or I could see\nsomething like eyes, legs, and ears, till I got close enough to them to\nsee that the eyes were knots, washed white with rain, and the legs were\nbroken limbs, and the ears, only ears owing to the point from which they\nwere seen. Thus early I learned that the point from which a thing is\nviewed is of some importance.\n\nAs the day advanced the heat increased; and it was not until the\nafternoon that we reached the much dreaded end of the journey. I found\nmyself in the midst of a group of children of many colors; black,\nbrown, copper colored, and nearly white. I had not seen so many children\nbefore. Great houses loomed up in different directions, and a great many\nmen and women were at work in the fields. All this hurry, noise, and\nsinging was very different from the stillness of Tuckahoe. As a new\ncomer, I was an object of special interest; and, after laughing and\nyelling around me, and playing all sorts of wild tricks, they (the\nchildren) asked me to go out and play with them. This I refused to do,\npreferring to stay with grandmamma. I could not help feeling that our\nbeing there boded no good to me. Grandmamma looked sad. She was soon to\nlose another object of affection, as she had lost many before. I knew\nshe was unhappy, and the shadow fell from her brow on me, though I knew\nnot the cause.\n\nAll suspense, however, must have an end; and the end of mine, in this\ninstance, was at hand. Affectionately patting me on the head, and\nexhorting me to be a good boy, grandmamma told me to go and play with\nthe little children. “They are kin to you,” said she; “go and play with\nthem.” Among a number of cousins were Phil, Tom, Steve, and Jerry, Nance\nand Betty.\n\nGrandmother pointed out my brother PERRY, my sister SARAH, and my sister\nELIZA, who stood in the group. I had never seen{37 BROTHERS AND SISTERS}\nmy brother nor my sisters before; and, though I had sometimes heard of\nthem, and felt a curious interest in them, I really did not understand\nwhat they were to me, or I to them. We were brothers and sisters, but\nwhat of that? Why should they be attached to me, or I to them? Brothers\nand sisters we were by blood; but _slavery_ had made us strangers. I\nheard the words brother and sisters, and knew they must mean something;\nbut slavery had robbed these terms of their true meaning. The experience\nthrough which I was passing, they had passed through before. They had\nalready been initiated into the mysteries of old master’s domicile, and\nthey seemed to look upon me with a certain degree of compassion; but my\nheart clave to my grandmother. Think it not strange, dear reader, that\nso little sympathy of feeling existed between us. The conditions of\nbrotherly and sisterly feeling were wanting--we had never nestled and\nplayed together. My poor mother, like many other slave-women, had many\n_children_, but NO FAMILY! The domestic hearth, with its holy lessons\nand precious endearments, is abolished in the case of a slave-mother\nand her children. “Little children, love one another,” are words seldom\nheard in a slave cabin.\n\nI really wanted to play with my brother and sisters, but they were\nstrangers to me, and I was full of fear that grandmother might leave\nwithout taking me with her. Entreated to do so, however, and that, too,\nby my dear grandmother, I went to the back part of the house, to play\nwith them and the other children. _Play_, however, I did not, but stood\nwith my back against the wall, witnessing the playing of the others.\nAt last, while standing there, one of the children, who had been in the\nkitchen, ran up to me, in a sort of roguish glee, exclaiming, “Fed, Fed!\ngrandmammy gone! grandmammy gone!” I could not believe it; yet, fearing\nthe worst, I ran into the kitchen, to see for myself, and found it even\nso. Grandmammy had indeed gone, and was now far away, “clean” out of\nsight. I need not tell all that happened now. Almost heart-broken at the\ndiscovery, I fell upon the ground, and{38} wept a boy’s bitter tears,\nrefusing to be comforted. My brother and sisters came around me, and\nsaid, “Don’t cry,” and gave me peaches and pears, but I flung them away,\nand refused all their kindly advances. I had never been deceived before;\nand I felt not only grieved at parting--as I supposed forever--with my\ngrandmother, but indignant that a trick had been played upon me in a\nmatter so serious.\n\nIt was now late in the afternoon. The day had been an exciting and\nwearisome one, and I knew not how or where, but I suppose I sobbed\nmyself to sleep. There is a healing in the angel wing of sleep, even for\nthe slave-boy; and its balm was never more welcome to any wounded soul\nthan it was to mine, the first night I spent at the domicile of old\nmaster. The reader may be surprised that I narrate so minutely an\nincident apparently so trivial, and which must have occurred when I was\nnot more than seven years old; but as I wish to give a faithful history\nof my experience in slavery, I cannot withhold a circumstance which, at\nthe time, affected me so deeply. Besides, this was, in fact, my first\nintroduction to the realities of slavery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. _Parentage_\n\nMY FATHER SHROUDED IN MYSTERY--MY MOTHER--HER PERSONAL\nAPPEARANCE--INTERFERENCE OF SLAVERY WITH THE NATURAL AFFECTIONS OF\nMOTHER AND CHILDREN--SITUATION OF MY MOTHER--HER NIGHTLY VISITS TO HER\nBOY--STRIKING INCIDENT--HER DEATH--HER PLACE OF BURIAL.\n\n\nIf the reader will now be kind enough to allow me time to grow bigger,\nand afford me an opportunity for my experience to become greater, I will\ntell him something, by-and-by, of slave life, as I saw, felt, and heard\nit, on Col. Edward Lloyd’s plantation, and at the house of old master,\nwhere I had now, despite of myself, most suddenly, but not unexpectedly,\nbeen dropped. Meanwhile, I will redeem my promise to say something more\nof my dear mother.\n\nI say nothing of _father_, for he is shrouded in a mystery I have never\nbeen able to penetrate. Slavery does away with fathers, as it does away\nwith families. Slavery has no use for either fathers or families, and\nits laws do not recognize their existence in the social arrangements\nof the plantation. When they _do_ exist, they are not the outgrowths of\nslavery, but are antagonistic to that system. The order of civilization\nis reversed here. The name of the child is not expected to be that of\nits father, and his condition does not necessarily affect that of the\nchild. He may be the slave of Mr. Tilgman; and his child, when born, may\nbe the slave of Mr. Gross. He may be a _freeman;_ and yet his child\nmay be a _chattel_. He may be white, glorying in the purity of his\nAnglo-Saxon{40} blood; and his child may be ranked with the blackest\nslaves. Indeed, he _may_ be, and often _is_, master and father to the\nsame child. He can be father without being a husband, and may sell his\nchild without incurring reproach, if the child be by a woman in whose\nveins courses one thirty-second part of African blood. My father was a\nwhite man, or nearly white. It was sometimes whispered that my master\nwas my father.\n\nBut to return, or rather, to begin. My knowledge of my mother is very\nscanty, but very distinct. Her personal appearance and bearing\nare ineffaceably stamped upon my memory. She was tall, and finely\nproportioned; of deep black, glossy complexion; had regular features,\nand, among the other slaves, was remarkably sedate in her manners. There\nis in _Prichard’s Natural History of Man_, the head of a figure--on page\n157--the features of which so resemble those of my mother, that I\noften recur to it with something of the feeling which I suppose others\nexperience when looking upon the pictures of dear departed ones.\n\nYet I cannot say that I was very deeply attached to my mother; certainly\nnot so deeply as I should have been had our relations in childhood been\ndifferent. We were separated, according to the common custom, when I\nwas but an infant, and, of course, before I knew my mother from any one\nelse.\n\nThe germs of affection with which the Almighty, in his wisdom and mercy,\narms the hopeless infant against the ills and vicissitudes of his lot,\nhad been directed in their growth toward that loving old grandmother,\nwhose gentle hand and kind deportment it was in the first effort of my\ninfantile understanding to comprehend and appreciate. Accordingly,\nthe tenderest affection which a beneficent Father allows, as a partial\ncompensation to the mother for the pains and lacerations of her heart,\nincident to the maternal relation, was, in my case, diverted from its\ntrue and natural object, by the envious, greedy, and treacherous hand of\nslavery. The slave-mother can be spared long enough from{41 MY MOTHER}\nthe field to endure all the bitterness of a mother’s anguish, when it\nadds another name to a master’s ledger, but _not_ long enough to receive\nthe joyous reward afforded by the intelligent smiles of her child. I\nnever think of this terrible interference of slavery with my infantile\naffections, and its diverting them from their natural course, without\nfeelings to which I can give no adequate expression.\n\nI do not remember to have seen my mother at my grandmother’s at\nany time. I remember her only in her visits to me at Col. Lloyd’s\nplantation, and in the kitchen of my old master. Her visits to me there\nwere few in number, brief in duration, and mostly made in the night.\nThe pains she took, and the toil she endured, to see me, tells me that\na true mother’s heart was hers, and that slavery had difficulty in\nparalyzing it with unmotherly indifference.\n\nMy mother was hired out to a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve miles\nfrom old master’s, and, being a field hand, she seldom had leisure, by\nday, for the performance of the journey. The nights and the distance\nwere both obstacles to her visits. She was obliged to walk, unless\nchance flung into her way an opportunity to ride; and the latter was\nsometimes her good luck. But she always had to walk one way or the\nother. It was a greater luxury than slavery could afford, to allow a\nblack slave-mother a horse or a mule, upon which to travel twenty-four\nmiles, when she could walk the distance. Besides, it is deemed a foolish\nwhim for a slave-mother to manifest concern to see her children, and,\nin one point of view, the case is made out--she can do nothing for them.\nShe has no control over them; the master is even more than the mother,\nin all matters touching the fate of her child. Why, then, should\nshe give herself any concern? She has no responsibility. Such is the\nreasoning, and such the practice. The iron rule of the plantation,\nalways passionately and violently enforced in that neighborhood, makes\nflogging the penalty of{42} failing to be in the field before sunrise in\nthe morning, unless special permission be given to the absenting slave.\n“I went to see my child,” is no excuse to the ear or heart of the\noverseer.\n\nOne of the visits of my mother to me, while at Col. Lloyd’s, I remember\nvery vividly, as affording a bright gleam of a mother’s love, and the\nearnestness of a mother’s care.\n\n“I had on that day offended “Aunt Katy,” (called “Aunt” by way of\nrespect,) the cook of old master’s establishment. I do not now remember\nthe nature of my offense in this instance, for my offenses were numerous\nin that quarter, greatly depending, however, upon the mood of Aunt Katy,\nas to their heinousness; but she had adopted, that day, her favorite\nmode of punishing me, namely, making me go without food all day--that\nis, from after breakfast. The first hour or two after dinner, I\nsucceeded pretty well in keeping up my spirits; but though I made\nan excellent stand against the foe, and fought bravely during the\nafternoon, I knew I must be conquered at last, unless I got the\naccustomed reenforcement of a slice of corn bread, at sundown. Sundown\ncame, but _no bread_, and, in its stead, their came the threat, with a\nscowl well suited to its terrible import, that she “meant to _starve\nthe life out of me!”_ Brandishing her knife, she chopped off the heavy\nslices for the other children, and put the loaf away, muttering, all the\nwhile, her savage designs upon myself. Against this disappointment, for\nI was expecting that her heart would relent at last, I made an extra\neffort to maintain my dignity; but when I saw all the other children\naround me with merry and satisfied faces, I could stand it no longer. I\nwent out behind the house, and cried like a fine fellow! When tired of\nthis, I returned to the kitchen, sat by the fire, and brooded over my\nhard lot. I was too hungry to sleep. While I sat in the corner, I caught\nsight of an ear of Indian corn on an upper shelf of the kitchen. I\nwatched my chance, and got it, and, shelling off a few grains, I put\nit back again. The grains in my hand, I quickly put in some ashes,\nand covered them with embers, to roast them. All this I{43} did\nat the risk of getting a brutual thumping, for Aunt Katy could beat, as\nwell as starve me. My corn was not long in roasting, and, with my keen\nappetite, it did not matter even if the grains were not exactly done. I\neagerly pulled them out, and placed them on my stool, in a clever little\npile. Just as I began to help myself to my very dry meal, in came my\ndear mother. And now, dear reader, a scene occurred which was altogether\nworth beholding, and to me it was instructive as well as interesting.\nThe friendless and hungry boy, in his extremest need--and when he did\nnot dare to look for succor--found himself in the strong, protecting\narms of a mother; a mother who was, at the moment (being endowed with\nhigh powers of manner as well as matter) more than a match for all\nhis enemies. I shall never forget the indescribable expression of her\ncountenance, when I told her that I had had no food since morning; and\nthat Aunt Katy said she “meant to starve the life out of me.” There was\npity in her glance at me, and a fiery indignation at Aunt Katy at the\nsame time; and, while she took the corn from me, and gave me a large\nginger cake, in its stead, she read Aunt Katy a lecture which she never\nforgot. My mother threatened her with complaining to old master in my\nbehalf; for the latter, though harsh and cruel himself, at times, did\nnot sanction the meanness, injustice, partiality and oppressions enacted\nby Aunt Katy in the kitchen. That night I learned the fact, that I was,\nnot only a child, but _somebody’s_ child. The “sweet cake” my mother\ngave me was in the shape of a heart, with a rich, dark ring glazed upon\nthe edge of it. I was victorious, and well off for the moment; prouder,\non my mother’s knee, than a king upon his throne. But my triumph was\nshort. I dropped off to sleep, and waked in the morning only to find my\nmother gone, and myself left at the mercy of the sable virago, dominant\nin my old master’s kitchen, whose fiery wrath was my constant dread.\n\nI do not remember to have seen my mother after this occurrence. Death\nsoon ended the little communication that had{44} existed between us;\nand with it, I believe, a life judging from her weary, sad, down-cast\ncountenance and mute demeanor--full of heartfelt sorrow. I was not\nallowed to visit her during any part of her long illness; nor did I see\nher for a long time before she was taken ill and died. The heartless and\nghastly form of _slavery_ rises between mother and child, even at the\nbed of death. The mother, at the verge of the grave, may not gather her\nchildren, to impart to them her holy admonitions, and invoke for them\nher dying benediction. The bond-woman lives as a slave, and is left to\ndie as a beast; often with fewer attentions than are paid to a favorite\nhorse. Scenes of sacred tenderness, around the death-bed, never\nforgotten, and which often arrest the vicious and confirm the virtuous\nduring life, must be looked for among the free, though they sometimes\noccur among the slaves. It has been a life-long, standing grief to me,\nthat I knew so little of my mother; and that I was so early separated\nfrom her. The counsels of her love must have been beneficial to me. The\nside view of her face is imaged on my memory, and I take few steps in\nlife, without feeling her presence; but the image is mute, and I have no\nstriking words of her’s treasured up.\n\nI learned, after my mother’s death, that she could read, and that she\nwas the _only_ one of all the slaves and colored people in Tuckahoe who\nenjoyed that advantage. How she acquired this knowledge, I know not, for\nTuckahoe is the last place in the world where she would be apt to find\nfacilities for learning. I can, therefore, fondly and proudly ascribe\nto her an earnest love of knowledge. That a “field hand” should learn\nto read, in any slave state, is remarkable; but the achievement of my\nmother, considering the place, was very extraordinary; and, in view of\nthat fact, I am quite willing, and even happy, to attribute any love of\nletters I possess, and for which I have got--despite of prejudices only\ntoo much credit, _not_ to my admitted Anglo-Saxon paternity, but to the\nnative genius of my sable, unprotected, and uncultivated _mother_--a\nwoman, who belonged to a race{45 PENALTY FOR HAVING A WHITE FATHER}\nwhose mental endowments it is, at present, fashionable to hold in\ndisparagement and contempt.\n\nSummoned away to her account, with the impassable gulf of slavery\nbetween us during her entire illness, my mother died without leaving me\na single intimation of _who_ my father was. There was a whisper, that my\nmaster was my father; yet it was only a whisper, and I cannot say that\nI ever gave it credence. Indeed, I now have reason to think he was not;\nnevertheless, the fact remains, in all its glaring odiousness, that,\nby the laws of slavery, children, in all cases, are reduced to the\ncondition of their mothers. This arrangement admits of the greatest\nlicense to brutal slaveholders, and their profligate sons, brothers,\nrelations and friends, and gives to the pleasure of sin, the additional\nattraction of profit. A whole volume might be written on this single\nfeature of slavery, as I have observed it.\n\nOne might imagine, that the children of such connections, would fare\nbetter, in the hands of their masters, than other slaves. The rule\nis quite the other way; and a very little reflection will satisfy the\nreader that such is the case. A man who will enslave his own blood,\nmay not be safely relied on for magnanimity. Men do not love those who\nremind them of their sins unless they have a mind to repent--and the\nmulatto child’s face is a standing accusation against him who is master\nand father to the child. What is still worse, perhaps, such a child is\na constant offense to the wife. She hates its very presence, and when a\nslaveholding woman hates, she wants not means to give that hate telling\neffect. Women--white women, I mean--are IDOLS at the south, not WIVES,\nfor the slave women are preferred in many instances; and if these\n_idols_ but nod, or lift a finger, woe to the poor victim: kicks, cuffs\nand stripes are sure to follow. Masters are frequently compelled to sell\nthis class of their slaves, out of deference to the feelings of their\nwhite wives; and shocking and scandalous as it may seem for a man to\nsell his own blood to the traffickers in human flesh, it is often an\nact of humanity{46} toward the slave-child to be thus removed from his\nmerciless tormentors.\n\nIt is not within the scope of the design of my simple story, to comment\nupon every phase of slavery not within my experience as a slave.\n\nBut, I may remark, that, if the lineal descendants of Ham are only to be\nenslaved, according to the scriptures, slavery in this country will soon\nbecome an unscriptural institution; for thousands are ushered into the\nworld, annually, who--like myself--owe their existence to white\nfathers, and, most frequently, to their masters, and master’s sons.\nThe slave-woman is at the mercy of the fathers, sons or brothers of her\nmaster. The thoughtful know the rest.\n\nAfter what I have now said of the circumstances of my mother, and my\nrelations to her, the reader will not be surprised, nor be disposed to\ncensure me, when I tell but the simple truth, viz: that I received the\ntidings of her death with no strong emotions of sorrow for her, and with\nvery little regret for myself on account of her loss. I had to learn the\nvalue of my mother long after her death, and by witnessing the devotion\nof other mothers to their children.\n\nThere is not, beneath the sky, an enemy to filial affection so\ndestructive as slavery. It had made my brothers and sisters strangers\nto me; it converted the mother that bore me, into a myth; it shrouded my\nfather in mystery, and left me without an intelligible beginning in the\nworld.\n\nMy mother died when I could not have been more than eight or nine years\nold, on one of old master’s farms in Tuckahoe, in the neighborhood of\nHillsborough. Her grave is, as the grave of the dead at sea, unmarked,\nand without stone or stake.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. _A General Survey of the Slave Plantation_\n\nISOLATION OF LLOYD S PLANTATION--PUBLIC OPINION THERE NO PROTECTION TO\nTHE SLAVE--ABSOLUTE POWER OF THE OVERSEER--NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL CHARMS\nOF THE PLACE--ITS BUSINESS-LIKE APPEARANCE--SUPERSTITION ABOUT THE\nBURIAL GROUND--GREAT IDEAS OF COL. LLOYD--ETIQUETTE AMONG SLAVES--THE\nCOMIC SLAVE DOCTOR--PRAYING AND FLOGGING--OLD MASTER LOSING ITS\nTERRORS--HIS BUSINESS--CHARACTER OF AUNT KATY--SUFFERINGS FROM\nHUNGER--OLD MASTER’S HOME--JARGON OF THE PLANTATION--GUINEA\nSLAVES--MASTER DANIEL--FAMILY OF COL. LLOYD--FAMILY OF CAPT.\nANTHONY--HIS SOCIAL POSITION--NOTIONS OF RANK AND STATION.\n\n\nIt is generally supposed that slavery, in the state of Maryland, exists\nin its mildest form, and that it is totally divested of those harsh and\nterrible peculiarities, which mark and characterize the slave system,\nin the southern and south-western states of the American union. The\nargument in favor of this opinion, is the contiguity of the free states,\nand the exposed condition of slavery in Maryland to the moral, religious\nand humane sentiment of the free states.\n\nI am not about to refute this argument, so far as it relates to slavery\nin that state, generally; on the contrary, I am willing to admit that,\nto this general point, the arguments is well grounded. Public opinion\nis, indeed, an unfailing restraint upon the cruelty and barbarity of\nmasters, overseers, and slave-drivers, whenever and wherever it can\nreach them; but there are certain secluded and out-of-the-way places,\neven in the state of Maryland, seldom visited by a single ray of\nhealthy public sentiment--where{48} slavery, wrapt in its own congenial,\nmidnight darkness, _can_, and _does_, develop all its malign and\nshocking characteristics; where it can be indecent without shame,\ncruel without shuddering, and murderous without apprehension or fear of\nexposure.\n\nJust such a secluded, dark, and out-of-the-way place, is the “home\nplantation” of Col. Edward Lloyd, on the Eastern Shore, Maryland. It is\nfar away from all the great thoroughfares, and is proximate to no\ntown or village. There is neither school-house, nor town-house in its\nneighborhood. The school-house is unnecessary, for there are no children\nto go to school. The children and grand-children of Col. Lloyd were\ntaught in the house, by a private tutor--a Mr. Page a tall, gaunt\nsapling of a man, who did not speak a dozen words to a slave in a whole\nyear. The overseers’ children go off somewhere to school; and they,\ntherefore, bring no foreign or dangerous influence from abroad, to\nembarrass the natural operation of the slave system of the place. Not\neven the mechanics--through whom there is an occasional out-burst\nof honest and telling indignation, at cruelty and wrong on other\nplantations--are white men, on this plantation. Its whole public is\nmade up of, and divided into, three classes--SLAVEHOLDERS, SLAVES and\nOVERSEERS. Its blacksmiths, wheelwrights, shoemakers, weavers, and\ncoopers, are slaves. Not even commerce, selfish and iron-hearted at\nit is, and ready, as it ever is, to side with the strong against the\nweak--the rich against the poor--is trusted or permitted within its\nsecluded precincts. Whether with a view of guarding against the escape\nof its secrets, I know not, but it is a fact, the every leaf and grain\nof the produce of this plantation, and those of the neighboring farms\nbelonging to Col. Lloyd, are transported to Baltimore in Col.\nLloyd’s own vessels; every man and boy on board of which--except\nthe captain--are owned by him. In return, everything brought to the\nplantation, comes through the same channel. Thus, even the glimmering\nand unsteady light of trade, which sometimes exerts a civilizing\ninfluence, is excluded from this “tabooed” spot.{49}\n\nNearly all the plantations or farms in the vicinity of the “home\nplantation” of Col. Lloyd, belong to him; and those which do not, are\nowned by personal friends of his, as deeply interested in maintaining\nthe slave system, in all its rigor, as Col. Lloyd himself. Some of his\nneighbors are said to be even more stringent than he. The Skinners, the\nPeakers, the Tilgmans, the Lockermans, and the Gipsons, are in the same\nboat; being slaveholding neighbors, they may have strengthened each\nother in their iron rule. They are on intimate terms, and their\ninterests and tastes are identical.\n\nPublic opinion in such a quarter, the reader will see, is not likely to\nvery efficient in protecting the slave from cruelty. On the contrary,\nit must increase and intensify his wrongs. Public opinion seldom differs\nvery widely from public practice. To be a restraint upon cruelty and\nvice, public opinion must emanate from a humane and virtuous community.\nTo no such humane and virtuous community, is Col. Lloyd’s plantation\nexposed. That plantation is a little nation of its own, having its\nown language, its own rules, regulations and customs. The laws and\ninstitutions of the state, apparently touch it nowhere. The troubles\narising here, are not settled by the civil power of the state. The\noverseer is generally accuser, judge, jury, advocate and executioner.\nThe criminal is always dumb. The overseer attends to all sides of a\ncase.\n\nThere are no conflicting rights of property, for all the people are\nowned by one man; and they can themselves own no property. Religion and\npolitics are alike excluded. One class of the population is too high to\nbe reached by the preacher; and the other class is too low to be cared\nfor by the preacher. The poor have the gospel preached to them, in this\nneighborhood, only when they are able to pay for it. The slaves, having\nno money, get no gospel. The politician keeps away, because the people\nhave no votes, and the preacher keeps away, because the people have no\nmoney. The rich planter can afford to learn politics in the parlor, and\nto dispense with religion altogether.{50}\n\nIn its isolation, seclusion, and self-reliant independence, Col. Lloyd’s\nplantation resembles what the baronial domains were during the middle\nages in Europe. Grim, cold, and unapproachable by all genial influences\nfrom communities without, _there it stands;_ full three hundred years\nbehind the age, in all that relates to humanity and morals.\n\nThis, however, is not the only view that the place presents.\nCivilization is shut out, but nature cannot be. Though separated from\nthe rest of the world; though public opinion, as I have said, seldom\ngets a chance to penetrate its dark domain; though the whole place\nis stamped with its own peculiar, ironlike individuality; and though\ncrimes, high-handed and atrocious, may there be committed, with almost\nas much impunity as upon the deck of a pirate ship--it is, nevertheless,\naltogether, to outward seeming, a most strikingly interesting place,\nfull of life, activity, and spirit; and presents a very favorable\ncontrast to the indolent monotony and languor of Tuckahoe. Keen as was\nmy regret and great as was my sorrow at leaving the latter, I was not\nlong in adapting myself to this, my new home. A man’s troubles are\nalways half disposed of, when he finds endurance his only remedy. I\nfound myself here; there was no getting away; and what remained for me,\nbut to make the best of it? Here were plenty of children to play with,\nand plenty of places of pleasant resort for boys of my age, and boys\nolder. The little tendrils of affection, so rudely and treacherously\nbroken from around the darling objects of my grandmother’s hut,\ngradually began to extend, and to entwine about the new objects by which\nI now found myself surrounded.\n\nThere was a windmill (always a commanding object to a child’s eye) on\nLong Point--a tract of land dividing Miles river from the Wye a mile or\nmore from my old master’s house. There was a creek to swim in, at the\nbottom of an open flat space, of twenty acres or more, called “the Long\nGreen”--a very beautiful play-ground for the children.{51}\n\nIn the river, a short distance from the shore, lying quietly at anchor,\nwith her small boat dancing at her stern, was a large sloop--the Sally\nLloyd; called by that name in honor of a favorite daughter of the\ncolonel. The sloop and the mill were wondrous things, full of thoughts\nand ideas. A child cannot well look at such objects without _thinking_.\n\nThen here were a great many houses; human habitations, full of the\nmysteries of life at every stage of it. There was the little red house,\nup the road, occupied by Mr. Sevier, the overseer. A little nearer to\nmy old master’s, stood a very long, rough, low building, literally alive\nwith slaves, of all ages, conditions and sizes. This was called “the\nLonge Quarter.” Perched upon a hill, across the Long Green, was a very\ntall, dilapidated, old brick building--the architectural dimensions of\nwhich proclaimed its erection for a different purpose--now occupied by\nslaves, in a similar manner to the Long Quarter. Besides these, there\nwere numerous other slave houses and huts, scattered around in the\nneighborhood, every nook and corner of which was completely occupied.\nOld master’s house, a long, brick building, plain, but substantial,\nstood in the center of the plantation life, and constituted one\nindependent establishment on the premises of Col. Lloyd.\n\nBesides these dwellings, there were barns, stables, store-houses,\nand tobacco-houses; blacksmiths’ shops, wheelwrights’ shops, coopers’\nshops--all objects of interest; but, above all, there stood the grandest\nbuilding my eyes had then ever beheld, called, by every one on the\nplantation, the “Great House.” This was occupied by Col. Lloyd and his\nfamily. They occupied it; _I_ enjoyed it. The great house was surrounded\nby numerous and variously shaped out-buildings. There were kitchens,\nwash-houses, dairies, summer-house, green-houses, hen-houses,\nturkey-houses, pigeon-houses, and arbors, of many sizes and devices,\nall neatly painted, and altogether interspersed with grand old trees,\nornamental and primitive, which afforded delightful shade in{52}\nsummer, and imparted to the scene a high degree of stately beauty. The\ngreat house itself was a large, white, wooden building, with wings\non three sides of it. In front, a large portico, extending the entire\nlength of the building, and supported by a long range of columns, gave\nto the whole establishment an air of solemn grandeur. It was a treat to\nmy young and gradually opening mind, to behold this elaborate exhibition\nof wealth, power, and vanity. The carriage entrance to the house was\na large gate, more than a quarter of a mile distant from it; the\nintermediate space was a beautiful lawn, very neatly trimmed, and\nwatched with the greatest care. It was dotted thickly over with\ndelightful trees, shrubbery, and flowers. The road, or lane, from the\ngate to the great house, was richly paved with white pebbles from the\nbeach, and, in its course, formed a complete circle around the beautiful\nlawn. Carriages going in and retiring from the great house, made the\ncircuit of the lawn, and their passengers were permitted to behold a\nscene of almost Eden-like beauty. Outside this select inclosure, were\nparks, where as about the residences of the English nobility--rabbits,\ndeer, and other wild game, might be seen, peering and playing about,\nwith none to molest them or make them afraid. The tops of the stately\npoplars were often covered with the red-winged black-birds, making all\nnature vocal with the joyous life and beauty of their wild, warbling\nnotes. These all belonged to me, as well as to Col. Edward Lloyd, and\nfor a time I greatly enjoyed them.\n\nA short distance from the great house, were the stately mansions of\nthe dead, a place of somber aspect. Vast tombs, embowered beneath the\nweeping willow and the fir tree, told of the antiquities of the Lloyd\nfamily, as well as of their wealth. Superstition was rife among the\nslaves about this family burying ground. Strange sights had been seen\nthere by some of the older slaves. Shrouded ghosts, riding on great\nblack horses, had been seen to enter; balls of fire had been seen to fly\nthere at midnight, and horrid sounds had been repeatedly heard. Slaves\nknow{53} enough of the rudiments of theology to believe that those go\nto hell who die slaveholders; and they often fancy such persons wishing\nthemselves back again, to wield the lash. Tales of sights and sounds,\nstrange and terrible, connected with the huge black tombs, were a very\ngreat security to the grounds about them, for few of the slaves felt\nlike approaching them even in the day time. It was a dark, gloomy and\nforbidding place, and it was difficult to feel that the spirits of the\nsleeping dust there deposited, reigned with the blest in the realms of\neternal peace.\n\nThe business of twenty or thirty farms was transacted at this, called,\nby way of eminence, “great house farm.” These farms all belonged to\nCol. Lloyd, as did, also, the slaves upon them. Each farm was under the\nmanagement of an overseer. As I have said of the overseer of the home\nplantation, so I may say of the overseers on the smaller ones; they\nstand between the slave and all civil constitutions--their word is law,\nand is implicitly obeyed.\n\nThe colonel, at this time, was reputed to be, and he apparently was,\nvery rich. His slaves, alone, were an immense fortune. These, small and\ngreat, could not have been fewer than one thousand in number, and though\nscarcely a month passed without the sale of one or more lots to the\nGeorgia traders, there was no apparent diminution in the number of his\nhuman stock: the home plantation merely groaned at a removal of the\nyoung increase, or human crop, then proceeded as lively as ever.\nHorse-shoeing, cart-mending, plow-repairing, coopering, grinding, and\nweaving, for all the neighboring farms, were performed here, and slaves\nwere employed in all these branches. “Uncle Tony” was the blacksmith;\n“Uncle Harry” was the cartwright; “Uncle Abel” was the shoemaker; and\nall these had hands to assist them in their several departments.\n\nThese mechanics were called “uncles” by all the younger slaves, not\nbecause they really sustained that relationship to any, but according to\nplantation _etiquette_, as a mark of respect, due{54} from the younger\nto the older slaves. Strange, and even ridiculous as it may seem, among\na people so uncultivated, and with so many stern trials to look in\nthe face, there is not to be found, among any people, a more rigid\nenforcement of the law of respect to elders, than they maintain. I\nset this down as partly constitutional with my race, and partly\nconventional. There is no better material in the world for making a\ngentleman, than is furnished in the African. He shows to others, and\nexacts for himself, all the tokens of respect which he is compelled to\nmanifest toward his master. A young slave must approach the company\nof the older with hat in hand, and woe betide him, if he fails to\nacknowledge a favor, of any sort, with the accustomed _“tank’ee,”_ &c.\nSo uniformly are good manners enforced among slaves, I can easily detect\na “bogus” fugitive by his manners.\n\nAmong other slave notabilities of the plantation, was one called by\neverybody Uncle Isaac Copper. It is seldom that a slave gets a surname\nfrom anybody in Maryland; and so completely has the south shaped the\nmanners of the north, in this respect, that even abolitionists make very\nlittle of the surname of a Negro. The only improvement on the “Bills,”\n “Jacks,” “Jims,” and “Neds” of the south, observable here is, that\n“William,” “John,” “James,” “Edward,” are substituted. It goes against\nthe grain to treat and address a Negro precisely as they would treat\nand address a white man. But, once in a while, in slavery as in the\nfree states, by some extraordinary circumstance, the Negro has a surname\nfastened to him, and holds it against all conventionalities. This was\nthe case with Uncle Isaac Copper. When the “uncle” was dropped, he\ngenerally had the prefix “doctor,” in its stead. He was our doctor of\nmedicine, and doctor of divinity as well. Where he took his degree I am\nunable to say, for he was not very communicative to inferiors, and I was\nemphatically such, being but a boy seven or eight years old. He was too\nwell established in his profession to permit questions as to his native\nskill, or his attainments. One qualification he undoubtedly had--he{55\nPRAYING AND FLOGGING} was a confirmed _cripple;_ and he could neither\nwork, nor would he bring anything if offered for sale in the market.\nThe old man, though lame, was no sluggard. He was a man that made his\ncrutches do him good service. He was always on the alert, looking up the\nsick, and all such as were supposed to need his counsel. His remedial\nprescriptions embraced four articles. For diseases of the body, _Epsom\nsalts and castor oil;_ for those of the soul, _the Lord’s Prayer_, and\n_hickory switches_!\n\nI was not long at Col. Lloyd’s before I was placed under the care of\nDoctor Issac Copper. I was sent to him with twenty or thirty other\nchildren, to learn the “Lord’s Prayer.” I found the old gentleman seated\non a huge three-legged oaken stool, armed with several large hickory\nswitches; and, from his position, he could reach--lame as he was--any\nboy in the room. After standing awhile to learn what was expected of us,\nthe old gentleman, in any other than a devotional tone, commanded us\nto kneel down. This done, he commenced telling us to say everything\nhe said. “Our Father”--this was repeated after him with promptness\nand uniformity; “Who art in heaven”--was less promptly and uniformly\nrepeated; and the old gentleman paused in the prayer, to give us a short\nlecture upon the consequences of inattention, both immediate and future,\nand especially those more immediate. About these he was absolutely\ncertain, for he held in his right hand the means of bringing all his\npredictions and warnings to pass. On he proceeded with the prayer; and\nwe with our thick tongues and unskilled ears, followed him to the best\nof our ability. This, however, was not sufficient to please the old\ngentleman. Everybody, in the south, wants the privilege of whipping\nsomebody else. Uncle Isaac shared the common passion of his country,\nand, therefore, seldom found any means of keeping his disciples in\norder short of flogging. “Say everything I say;” and bang would come\nthe switch on some poor boy’s undevotional head. _“What you looking at\nthere”--“Stop that pushing”_--and down again would come the lash.{56}\n\nThe whip is all in all. It is supposed to secure obedience to the\nslaveholder, and is held as a sovereign remedy among the slaves\nthemselves, for every form of disobedience, temporal or spiritual.\nSlaves, as well as slaveholders, use it with an unsparing hand. Our\ndevotions at Uncle Isaac’s combined too much of the tragic and comic, to\nmake them very salutary in a spiritual point of view; and it is due\nto truth to say, I was often a truant when the time for attending the\npraying and flogging of Doctor Isaac Copper came on.\n\nThe windmill under the care of Mr. Kinney, a kind hearted old\nEnglishman, was to me a source of infinite interest and pleasure. The\nold man always seemed pleased when he saw a troop of darkey little\nurchins, with their tow-linen shirts fluttering in the breeze,\napproaching to view and admire the whirling wings of his wondrous\nmachine. From the mill we could see other objects of deep interest.\nThese were, the vessels from St. Michael’s, on their way to Baltimore.\nIt was a source of much amusement to view the flowing sails and\ncomplicated rigging, as the little crafts dashed by, and to speculate\nupon Baltimore, as to the kind and quality of the place. With so many\nsources of interest around me, the reader may be prepared to learn that\nI began to think very highly of Col. L.’s plantation. It was just a\nplace to my boyish taste. There were fish to be caught in the creek, if\none only had a hook and line; and crabs, clams and oysters were to be\ncaught by wading, digging and raking for them. Here was a field for\nindustry and enterprise, strongly inviting; and the reader may be\nassured that I entered upon it with spirit.\n\nEven the much dreaded old master, whose merciless fiat had brought me\nfrom Tuckahoe, gradually, to my mind, parted with his terrors. Strange\nenough, his reverence seemed to take no particular notice of me, nor of\nmy coming. Instead of leaping out and devouring me, he scarcely seemed\nconscious of my presence. The fact is, he was occupied with matters\nmore weighty and important than either looking after or vexing me. He\nprobably thought as{57 “OLD MASTER” LOSING ITS TERRORS} little of my\nadvent, as he would have thought of the addition of a single pig to his\nstock!\n\nAs the chief butler on Col. Lloyd’s plantation, his duties were numerous\nand perplexing. In almost all important matters he answered in Col.\nLloyd’s stead. The overseers of all the farms were in some sort under\nhim, and received the law from his mouth. The colonel himself seldom\naddressed an overseer, or allowed an overseer to address him. Old master\ncarried the keys of all store houses; measured out the allowance for\neach slave at the end of every month; superintended the storing of all\ngoods brought to the plantation; dealt out the raw material to all the\nhandicraftsmen; shipped the grain, tobacco, and all saleable produce of\nthe plantation to market, and had the general oversight of the coopers’\nshop, wheelwrights’ shop, blacksmiths’ shop, and shoemakers’ shop.\nBesides the care of these, he often had business for the plantation\nwhich required him to be absent two and three days.\n\nThus largely employed, he had little time, and perhaps as little\ndisposition, to interfere with the children individually. What he was to\nCol. Lloyd, he made Aunt Katy to him. When he had anything to say or do\nabout us, it was said or done in a wholesale manner; disposing of us in\nclasses or sizes, leaving all minor details to Aunt Katy, a person of\nwhom the reader has already received no very favorable impression. Aunt\nKaty was a woman who never allowed herself to act greatly within the\nmargin of power granted to her, no matter how broad that authority might\nbe. Ambitious, ill-tempered and cruel, she found in her present position\nan ample field for the exercise of her ill-omened qualities. She had a\nstrong hold on old master she was considered a first rate cook, and she\nreally was very industrious. She was, therefore, greatly favored by old\nmaster, and as one mark of his favor, she was the only mother who was\npermitted to retain her children around her. Even to these children she\nwas often fiendish in her brutality. She pursued her son Phil, one day,\nin{58} my presence, with a huge butcher knife, and dealt a blow with its\nedge which left a shocking gash on his arm, near the wrist. For this,\nold master did sharply rebuke her, and threatened that if she ever\nshould do the like again, he would take the skin off her back. Cruel,\nhowever, as Aunt Katy was to her own children, at times she was not\ndestitute of maternal feeling, as I often had occasion to know, in the\nbitter pinches of hunger I had to endure. Differing from the practice\nof Col. Lloyd, old master, instead of allowing so much for each slave,\ncommitted the allowance for all to the care of Aunt Katy, to be divided\nafter cooking it, amongst us. The allowance, consisting of coarse\ncorn-meal, was not very abundant--indeed, it was very slender; and in\npassing through Aunt Katy’s hands, it was made more slender still, for\nsome of us. William, Phil and Jerry were her children, and it is not to\naccuse her too severely, to allege that she was often guilty of starving\nmyself and the other children, while she was literally cramming her own.\nWant of food was my chief trouble the first summer at my old master’s.\nOysters and clams would do very well, with an occasional supply of\nbread, but they soon failed in the absence of bread. I speak but the\nsimple truth, when I say, I have often been so pinched with hunger, that\nI have fought with the dog--“Old Nep”--for the smallest crumbs that fell\nfrom the kitchen table, and have been glad when I won a single crumb\nin the combat. Many times have I followed, with eager step, the\nwaiting-girl when she went out to shake the table cloth, to get the\ncrumbs and small bones flung out for the cats. The water, in which meat\nhad been boiled, was as eagerly sought for by me. It was a great thing\nto get the privilege of dipping a piece of bread in such water; and\nthe skin taken from rusty bacon, was a positive luxury. Nevertheless,\nI sometimes got full meals and kind words from sympathizing old slaves,\nwho knew my sufferings, and received the comforting assurance that I\nshould be a man some day. “Never mind, honey--better day comin’,” was\neven then a solace, a cheering consolation to me in my{59} troubles. Nor\nwere all the kind words I received from slaves. I had a friend in the\nparlor, as well, and one to whom I shall be glad to do justice, before I\nhave finished this part of my story.\n\nI was not long at old master’s, before I learned that his surname was\nAnthony, and that he was generally called “Captain Anthony”--a title\nwhich he probably acquired by sailing a craft in the Chesapeake Bay.\nCol. Lloyd’s slaves never called Capt. Anthony “old master,” but always\nCapt. Anthony; and _me_ they called “Captain Anthony Fred.” There\nis not, probably, in the whole south, a plantation where the English\nlanguage is more imperfectly spoken than on Col. Lloyd’s. It is a\nmixture of Guinea and everything else you please. At the time of which\nI am now writing, there were slaves there who had been brought from the\ncoast of Africa. They never used the “s” in indication of the possessive\ncase. “Cap’n Ant’ney Tom,” “Lloyd Bill,” “Aunt Rose Harry,” means\n“Captain Anthony’s Tom,” “Lloyd’s Bill,” &c. _“Oo you dem long to?”_\nmeans, “Whom do you belong to?” _“Oo dem got any peachy?”_ means, “Have\nyou got any peaches?” I could scarcely understand them when I first went\namong them, so broken was their speech; and I am persuaded that I could\nnot have been dropped anywhere on the globe, where I could reap less,\nin the way of knowledge, from my immediate associates, than on this\nplantation. Even “MAS’ DANIEL,” by his association with his father’s\nslaves, had measurably adopted their dialect and their ideas, so far\nas they had ideas to be adopted. The equality of nature is strongly\nasserted in childhood, and childhood requires children for associates.\n_Color_ makes no difference with a child. Are you a child with wants,\ntastes and pursuits common to children, not put on, but natural? then,\nwere you black as ebony you would be welcome to the child of alabaster\nwhiteness. The law of compensation holds here, as well as elsewhere.\nMas’ Daniel could not associate with ignorance without sharing its\nshade; and he could not give his black playmates his company, without\ngiving them his intelligence, as well. Without knowing{60} this, or\ncaring about it, at the time, I, for some cause or other, spent much of\nmy time with Mas’ Daniel, in preference to spending it with most of the\nother boys.\n\nMas’ Daniel was the youngest son of Col. Lloyd; his older brothers\nwere Edward and Murray--both grown up, and fine looking men. Edward was\nespecially esteemed by the children, and by me among the rest; not that\nhe ever said anything to us or for us, which could be called especially\nkind; it was enough for us, that he never looked nor acted scornfully\ntoward us. There were also three sisters, all married; one to Edward\nWinder; a second to Edward Nicholson; a third to Mr. Lownes.\n\nThe family of old master consisted of two sons, Andrew and Richard; his\ndaughter, Lucretia, and her newly married husband, Capt. Auld. This\nwas the house family. The kitchen family consisted of Aunt Katy, Aunt\nEsther, and ten or a dozen children, most of them older than myself.\nCapt. Anthony was not considered a rich slaveholder, but was pretty well\noff in the world. He owned about thirty _“head”_ of slaves, and three\nfarms in Tuckahoe. The most valuable part of his property was his\nslaves, of whom he could afford to sell one every year. This crop,\ntherefore, brought him seven or eight hundred dollars a year, besides\nhis yearly salary, and other revenue from his farms.\n\nThe idea of rank and station was rigidly maintained on Col. Lloyd’s\nplantation. Our family never visited the great house, and the Lloyds\nnever came to our home. Equal non-intercourse was observed between Capt.\nAnthony’s family and that of Mr. Sevier, the overseer.\n\nSuch, kind reader, was the community, and such the place, in which my\nearliest and most lasting impressions of slavery, and of slave-life,\nwere received; of which impressions you will learn more in the coming\nchapters of this book.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. _Gradual Initiation to the Mysteries of Slavery_\n\nGROWING ACQUAINTANCE WITH OLD MASTER--HIS CHARACTER--EVILS OF\nUNRESTRAINED PASSION--APPARENT TENDERNESS--OLD MASTER A MAN OF\nTROUBLE--CUSTOM OF MUTTERING TO HIMSELF--NECESSITY OF BEING AWARE OF\nHIS WORDS--THE SUPPOSED OBTUSENESS OF SLAVE-CHILDREN--BRUTAL\nOUTRAGE--DRUNKEN OVERSEER--SLAVEHOLDER’S IMPATIENCE--WISDOM OF APPEALING\nTO SUPERIORS--THE SLAVEHOLDER S WRATH BAD AS THAT OF THE OVERSEER--A\nBASE AND SELFISH ATTEMPT TO BREAK UP A COURTSHIP--A HARROWING SCENE.\n\n\nAlthough my old master--Capt. Anthony--gave me at first, (as the reader\nwill have already seen) very little attention, and although that little\nwas of a remarkably mild and gentle description, a few months only were\nsufficient to convince me that mildness and gentleness were not the\nprevailing or governing traits of his character. These excellent\nqualities were displayed only occasionally. He could, when it suited\nhim, appear to be literally insensible to the claims of humanity, when\nappealed to by the helpless against an aggressor, and he could himself\ncommit outrages, deep, dark and nameless. Yet he was not by nature worse\nthan other men. Had he been brought up in a free state, surrounded by\nthe just restraints of free society--restraints which are necessary to\nthe freedom of all its members, alike and equally--Capt. Anthony might\nhave been as humane a man, and every way as respectable, as many who\nnow oppose the slave system; certainly as humane and respectable as are\nmembers of society generally. The slaveholder, as well as the slave, is\nthe victim of the slave{62} system. A man’s character greatly takes its\nhue and shape from the form and color of things about him. Under the\nwhole heavens there is no relation more unfavorable to the development\nof honorable character, than that sustained by the slaveholder to the\nslave. Reason is imprisoned here, and passions run wild. Like the fires\nof the prairie, once lighted, they are at the mercy of every wind, and\nmust burn, till they have consumed all that is combustible within their\nremorseless grasp. Capt. Anthony could be kind, and, at times, he even\nshowed an affectionate disposition. Could the reader have seen him\ngently leading me by the hand--as he sometimes did--patting me on the\nhead, speaking to me in soft, caressing tones and calling me his “little\nIndian boy,” he would have deemed him a kind old man, and really,\nalmost fatherly. But the pleasant moods of a slaveholder are remarkably\nbrittle; they are easily snapped; they neither come often, nor remain\nlong. His temper is subjected to perpetual trials; but, since these\ntrials are never borne patiently, they add nothing to his natural stock\nof patience.\n\nOld master very early impressed me with the idea that he was an unhappy\nman. Even to my child’s eye, he wore a troubled, and at times, a haggard\naspect. His strange movements excited my curiosity, and awakened my\ncompassion. He seldom walked alone without muttering to himself; and he\noccasionally stormed about, as if defying an army of invisible foes. “He\nwould do this, that, and the other; he’d be d--d if he did not,”--was\nthe usual form of his threats. Most of his leisure was spent in\nwalking, cursing and gesticulating, like one possessed by a demon. Most\nevidently, he was a wretched man, at war with his own soul, and with\nall the world around him. To be overheard by the children, disturbed him\nvery little. He made no more of our presence, than of that of the ducks\nand geese which he met on the green. He little thought that the little\nblack urchins around him, could see, through those vocal crevices, the\nvery secrets of his heart. Slaveholders ever underrate the intelligence\nwith which{63 SUPPOSED OBTUSENESS OF SLAVE-CHILDREN} they have to\ngrapple. I really understood the old man’s mutterings, attitudes and\ngestures, about as well as he did himself. But slaveholders never\nencourage that kind of communication, with the slaves, by which they\nmight learn to measure the depths of his knowledge. Ignorance is a high\nvirtue in a human chattel; and as the master studies to keep the slave\nignorant, the slave is cunning enough to make the master think he\nsucceeds. The slave fully appreciates the saying, “where ignorance is\nbliss, ‘tis folly to be wise.” When old master’s gestures were violent,\nending with a threatening shake of the head, and a sharp snap of his\nmiddle finger and thumb, I deemed it wise to keep at a respectable\ndistance from him; for, at such times, trifling faults stood, in\nhis eyes, as momentous offenses; and, having both the power and the\ndisposition, the victim had only to be near him to catch the punishment,\ndeserved or undeserved.\n\nOne of the first circumstances that opened my eyes to the cruelty and\nwickedness of slavery, and the heartlessness of my old master, was the\nrefusal of the latter to interpose his authority, to protect and shield\na young woman, who had been most cruelly abused and beaten by his\noverseer in Tuckahoe. This overseer--a Mr. Plummer--was a man like most\nof his class, little better than a human brute; and, in addition to\nhis general profligacy and repulsive coarseness, the creature was a\nmiserable drunkard. He was, probably, employed by my old master, less\non account of the excellence of his services, than for the cheap rate at\nwhich they could be obtained. He was not fit to have the management of\na drove of mules. In a fit of drunken madness, he committed the outrage\nwhich brought the young woman in question down to my old master’s for\nprotection. This young woman was the daughter of Milly, an own aunt\nof mine. The poor girl, on arriving at our house, presented a pitiable\nappearance. She had left in haste, and without preparation; and,\nprobably, without the knowledge of Mr. Plummer. She had traveled\ntwelve miles, bare-footed, bare-necked and bare-headed. Her neck and\nshoulders{64} were covered with scars, newly made; and not content with\nmarring her neck and shoulders, with the cowhide, the cowardly brute had\ndealt her a blow on the head with a hickory club, which cut a horrible\ngash, and left her face literally covered with blood. In this condition,\nthe poor young woman came down, to implore protection at the hands of my\nold master. I expected to see him boil over with rage at the revolting\ndeed, and to hear him fill the air with curses upon the brutual Plummer;\nbut I was disappointed. He sternly told her, in an angry tone, he\n“believed she deserved every bit of it,” and, if she did not go home\ninstantly, he would himself take the remaining skin from her neck and\nback. Thus was the poor girl compelled to return, without redress, and\nperhaps to receive an additional flogging for daring to appeal to old\nmaster against the overseer.\n\nOld master seemed furious at the thought of being troubled by such\ncomplaints. I did not, at that time, understand the philosophy of his\ntreatment of my cousin. It was stern, unnatural, violent. Had the man no\nbowels of compassion? Was he dead to all sense of humanity? No. I think\nI now understand it. This treatment is a part of the system, rather than\na part of the man. Were slaveholders to listen to complaints of this\nsort against the overseers, the luxury of owning large numbers of\nslaves, would be impossible. It would do away with the office of\noverseer, entirely; or, in other words, it would convert the master\nhimself into an overseer. It would occasion great loss of time and\nlabor, leaving the overseer in fetters, and without the necessary power\nto secure obedience to his orders. A privilege so dangerous as that of\nappeal, is, therefore, strictly prohibited; and any one exercising it,\nruns a fearful hazard. Nevertheless, when a slave has nerve enough\nto exercise it, and boldly approaches his master, with a well-founded\ncomplaint against an overseer, though he may be repulsed, and may even\nhave that of which he complains repeated at the time, and, though he may\nbe beaten by his master, as well as by the overseer, for his temerity,\nin the end the{65} policy of complaining is, generally, vindicated by\nthe relaxed rigor of the overseer’s treatment. The latter becomes more\ncareful, and less disposed to use the lash upon such slaves thereafter.\nIt is with this final result in view, rather than with any expectation\nof immediate good, that the outraged slave is induced to meet his master\nwith a complaint. The overseer very naturally dislikes to have the\near of the master disturbed by complaints; and, either upon this\nconsideration, or upon advice and warning privately given him by\nhis employers, he generally modifies the rigor of his rule, after an\noutbreak of the kind to which I have been referring.\n\nHowsoever the slaveholder may allow himself to act toward his slave,\nand, whatever cruelty he may deem it wise, for example’s sake, or for\nthe gratification of his humor, to inflict, he cannot, in the absence\nof all provocation, look with pleasure upon the bleeding wounds of a\ndefenseless slave-woman. When he drives her from his presence without\nredress, or the hope of redress, he acts, generally, from motives of\npolicy, rather than from a hardened nature, or from innate brutality.\nYet, let but his own temper be stirred, his own passions get loose, and\nthe slave-owner will go _far beyond_ the overseer in cruelty. He will\nconvince the slave that his wrath is far more terrible and boundless,\nand vastly more to be dreaded, than that of the underling overseer. What\nmay have been mechanically and heartlessly done by the overseer, is now\ndone with a will. The man who now wields the lash is irresponsible.\nHe may, if he pleases, cripple or kill, without fear of consequences;\nexcept in so far as it may concern profit or loss. To a man of\nviolent temper--as my old master was--this was but a very slender and\ninefficient restraint. I have seen him in a tempest of passion, such\nas I have just described--a passion into which entered all the bitter\ningredients of pride, hatred, envy, jealousy, and the thrist(sic) for\nrevenge.\n\nThe circumstances which I am about to narrate, and which gave rise to\nthis fearful tempest of passion, are not singular nor{66} isolated in\nslave life, but are common in every slaveholding community in which I\nhave lived. They are incidental to the relation of master and slave, and\nexist in all sections of slave-holding countries.\n\nThe reader will have noticed that, in enumerating the names of the\nslaves who lived with my old master, _Esther_ is mentioned. This was a\nyoung woman who possessed that which is ever a curse to the slave-girl;\nnamely--personal beauty. She was tall, well formed, and made a fine\nappearance. The daughters of Col. Lloyd could scarcely surpass her in\npersonal charms. Esther was courted by Ned Roberts, and he was as fine\nlooking a young man, as she was a woman. He was the son of a favorite\nslave of Col. Lloyd. Some slaveholders would have been glad to promote\nthe marriage of two such persons; but, for some reason or other, my old\nmaster took it upon him to break up the growing intimacy between Esther\nand Edward. He strictly ordered her to quit the company of said Roberts,\ntelling her that he would punish her severely if he ever found her again\nin Edward’s company. This unnatural and heartless order was, of course,\nbroken. A woman’s love is not to be annihilated by the peremptory\ncommand of any one, whose breath is in his nostrils. It was impossible\nto keep Edward and Esther apart. Meet they would, and meet they did. Had\nold master been a man of honor and purity, his motives, in this matter,\nmight have been viewed more favorably. As it was, his motives were as\nabhorrent, as his methods were foolish and contemptible. It was too\nevident that he was not concerned for the girl’s welfare. It is one\nof the damning characteristics of the slave system, that it robs its\nvictims of every earthly incentive to a holy life. The fear of God, and\nthe hope of heaven, are found sufficient to sustain many slave-women,\namidst the snares and dangers of their strange lot; but, this side of\nGod and heaven, a slave-woman is at the mercy of the power, caprice\nand passion of her owner. Slavery provides no means for the honorable\ncontinuance of the race. Marriage as imposing obligations on the parties\nto it--has no{67 A HARROWING SCENE} existence here, except in such\nhearts as are purer and higher than the standard morality around them.\nIt is one of the consolations of my life, that I know of many honorable\ninstances of persons who maintained their honor, where all around was\ncorrupt.\n\nEsther was evidently much attached to Edward, and abhorred--as she had\nreason to do--the tyrannical and base behavior of old master. Edward\nwas young, and fine looking, and he loved and courted her. He might have\nbeen her husband, in the high sense just alluded to; but WHO and _what_\nwas this old master? His attentions were plainly brutal and selfish, and\nit was as natural that Esther should loathe him, as that she should\nlove Edward. Abhorred and circumvented as he was, old master, having the\npower, very easily took revenge. I happened to see this exhibition of\nhis rage and cruelty toward Esther. The time selected was singular. It\nwas early in the morning, when all besides was still, and before any of\nthe family, in the house or kitchen, had left their beds. I saw but few\nof the shocking preliminaries, for the cruel work had begun before I\nawoke. I was probably awakened by the shrieks and piteous cries of poor\nEsther. My sleeping place was on the floor of a little, rough closet,\nwhich opened into the kitchen; and through the cracks of its unplaned\nboards, I could distinctly see and hear what was going on, without being\nseen by old master. Esther’s wrists were firmly tied, and the twisted\nrope was fastened to a strong staple in a heavy wooden joist above, near\nthe fireplace. Here she stood, on a bench, her arms tightly drawn over\nher breast. Her back and shoulders were bare to the waist. Behind her\nstood old master, with cowskin in hand, preparing his barbarous work\nwith all manner of harsh, coarse, and tantalizing epithets. The screams\nof his victim were most piercing. He was cruelly deliberate, and\nprotracted the torture, as one who was delighted with the scene. Again\nand again he drew the hateful whip through his hand, adjusting it with\na view of dealing the most pain-giving blow. Poor Esther had never yet\nbeen severely whipped, and her shoulders{68} were plump and tender.\nEach blow, vigorously laid on, brought screams as well as blood. _“Have\nmercy; Oh! have mercy”_ she cried; “_I won’t do so no more;”_ but her\npiercing cries seemed only to increase his fury. His answers to them are\ntoo coarse and blasphemous to be produced here. The whole scene, with\nall its attendants, was revolting and shocking, to the last degree; and\nwhen the motives of this brutal castigation are considered,--language\nhas no power to convey a just sense of its awful criminality. After\nlaying on some thirty or forty stripes, old master untied his suffering\nvictim, and let her get down. She could scarcely stand, when untied.\nFrom my heart I pitied her, and--child though I was--the outrage kindled\nin me a feeling far from peaceful; but I was hushed, terrified, stunned,\nand could do nothing, and the fate of Esther might be mine next. The\nscene here described was often repeated in the case of poor Esther, and\nher life, as I knew it, was one of wretchedness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. _Treatment of Slaves on Lloyd’s Plantation_\n\nEARLY REFLECTIONS ON SLAVERY--PRESENTIMENT OF ONE DAY BEING A\nFREEMAN--COMBAT BETWEEN AN OVERSEER AND A SLAVEWOMAN--THE ADVANTAGES\nOF RESISTANCE--ALLOWANCE DAY ON THE HOME PLANTATION--THE SINGING\nOF SLAVES--AN EXPLANATION--THE SLAVES FOOD AND CLOTHING--NAKED\nCHILDREN--LIFE IN THE QUARTER--DEPRIVATION OF SLEEP--NURSING CHILDREN\nCARRIED TO THE FIELD--DESCRIPTION OF THE COWSKIN--THE ASH-CAKE--MANNER\nOF MAKING IT--THE DINNER HOUR--THE CONTRAST.\n\n\nThe heart-rending incidents, related in the foregoing chapter, led me,\nthus early, to inquire into the nature and history of slavery. _Why am I\na slave? Why are some people slaves, and others masters? Was there ever\na time this was not so? How did the relation commence?_ These were\nthe perplexing questions which began now to claim my thoughts, and to\nexercise the weak powers of my mind, for I was still but a child,\nand knew less than children of the same age in the free states. As my\nquestions concerning these things were only put to children a little\nolder, and little better informed than myself, I was not rapid in\nreaching a solid footing. By some means I learned from these inquiries\nthat _“God, up in the sky,”_ made every body; and that he made _white_\npeople to be masters and mistresses, and _black_ people to be slaves.\nThis did not satisfy me, nor lessen my interest in the subject. I was\ntold, too, that God was good, and that He knew what was best for me, and\nbest for everybody. This was less satisfactory than the first statement;\nbecause it came, point blank, against all my{70} notions of goodness.\nIt was not good to let old master cut the flesh off Esther, and make her\ncry so. Besides, how did people know that God made black people to be\nslaves? Did they go up in the sky and learn it? or, did He come down and\ntell them so? All was dark here. It was some relief to my hard\nnotions of the goodness of God, that, although he made white men to be\nslaveholders, he did not make them to be _bad_ slaveholders, and that,\nin due time, he would punish the bad slaveholders; that he would, when\nthey died, send them to the bad place, where they would be “burnt up.”\n Nevertheless, I could not reconcile the relation of slavery with my\ncrude notions of goodness.\n\nThen, too, I found that there were puzzling exceptions to this theory\nof slavery on both sides, and in the middle. I knew of blacks who were\n_not_ slaves; I knew of whites who were _not_ slaveholders; and I knew\nof persons who were _nearly_ white, who were slaves. _Color_, therefore,\nwas a very unsatisfactory basis for slavery.\n\nOnce, however, engaged in the inquiry, I was not very long in finding\nout the true solution of the matter. It was not _color_, but _crime_,\nnot _God_, but _man_, that afforded the true explanation of the\nexistence of slavery; nor was I long in finding out another important\ntruth, viz: what man can make, man can unmake. The appalling darkness\nfaded away, and I was master of the subject. There were slaves here,\ndirect from Guinea; and there were many who could say that their fathers\nand mothers were stolen from Africa--forced from their homes, and\ncompelled to serve as slaves. This, to me, was knowledge; but it was\na kind of knowledge which filled me with a burning hatred of slavery,\nincreased my suffering, and left me without the means of breaking away\nfrom my bondage. Yet it was knowledge quite worth possessing. I could\nnot have been more than seven or eight years old, when I began to make\nthis subject my study. It was with me in the woods and fields; along the\nshore of the river, and wherever my boyish wanderings led me; and though\nI was, at that time,{71 EARLY REFLECTIONS ON SLAVERY} quite ignorant\nof the existence of the free states, I distinctly remember being, _even\nthen_, most strongly impressed with the idea of being a freeman some\nday. This cheering assurance was an inborn dream of my human nature a\nconstant menace to slavery--and one which all the powers of slavery were\nunable to silence or extinguish.\n\nUp to the time of the brutal flogging of my Aunt Esther--for she was\nmy own aunt--and the horrid plight in which I had seen my cousin from\nTuckahoe, who had been so badly beaten by the cruel Mr. Plummer, my\nattention had not been called, especially, to the gross features of\nslavery. I had, of course, heard of whippings and of savage _rencontres_\nbetween overseers and slaves, but I had always been out of the way at\nthe times and places of their occurrence. My plays and sports, most of\nthe time, took me from the corn and tobacco fields, where the great body\nof the hands were at work, and where scenes of cruelty were enacted and\nwitnessed. But, after the whipping of Aunt Esther, I saw many cases of\nthe same shocking nature, not only in my master’s house, but on Col.\nLloyd’s plantation. One of the first which I saw, and which greatly\nagitated me, was the whipping of a woman belonging to Col. Lloyd, named\nNelly. The offense alleged against Nelly, was one of the commonest and\nmost indefinite in the whole catalogue of offenses usually laid to the\ncharge of slaves, viz: “impudence.” This may mean almost anything, or\nnothing at all, just according to the caprice of the master or overseer,\nat the moment. But, whatever it is, or is not, if it gets the name\nof “impudence,” the party charged with it is sure of a flogging. This\noffense may be committed in various ways; in the tone of an answer; in\nanswering at all; in not answering; in the expression of countenance; in\nthe motion of the head; in the gait, manner and bearing of the slave.\nIn the case under consideration, I can easily believe that, according to\nall slaveholding standards, here was a genuine instance of impudence.\nIn Nelly there were all the necessary conditions for committing the\noffense. She was{72} a bright mulatto, the recognized wife of a favorite\n“hand” on board Col. Lloyd’s sloop, and the mother of five sprightly\nchildren. She was a vigorous and spirited woman, and one of the most\nlikely, on the plantation, to be guilty of impudence. My attention was\ncalled to the scene, by the noise, curses and screams that proceeded\nfrom it; and, on going a little in that direction, I came upon the\nparties engaged in the skirmish. Mr. Siever, the overseer, had hold\nof Nelly, when I caught sight of them; he was endeavoring to drag her\ntoward a tree, which endeavor Nelly was sternly resisting; but to\nno purpose, except to retard the progress of the overseer’s plans.\nNelly--as I have said--was the mother of five children; three of them\nwere present, and though quite small (from seven to ten years old, I\nshould think) they gallantly came to their mother’s defense, and gave\nthe overseer an excellent pelting with stones. One of the little fellows\nran up, seized the overseer by the leg and bit him; but the monster was\ntoo busily engaged with Nelly, to pay any attention to the assaults of\nthe children. There were numerous bloody marks on Mr. Sevier’s face,\nwhen I first saw him, and they increased as the struggle went on. The\nimprints of Nelly’s fingers were visible, and I was glad to see them.\nAmidst the wild screams of the children--“_Let my mammy go”--“let my\nmammy go_”--there escaped, from between the teeth of the bullet-headed\noverseer, a few bitter curses, mingled with threats, that “he would\nteach the d--d b--h how to give a white man impudence.” There is no\ndoubt that Nelly felt herself superior, in some respects, to the slaves\naround her. She was a wife and a mother; her husband was a valued and\nfavorite slave. Besides, he was one of the first hands on board of the\nsloop, and the sloop hands--since they had to represent the plantation\nabroad--were generally treated tenderly. The overseer never was allowed\nto whip Harry; why then should he be allowed to whip Harry’s wife?\nThoughts of this kind, no doubt, influenced her; but, for whatever\nreason, she nobly resisted, and, unlike most of the slaves,{73 COMBAT\nBETWEEN MR. SEVIER AND NELLY} seemed determined to make her whipping\ncost Mr. Sevier as much as possible. The blood on his (and her) face,\nattested her skill, as well as her courage and dexterity in using her\nnails. Maddened by her resistance, I expected to see Mr. Sevier\nlevel her to the ground by a stunning blow; but no; like a savage\nbull-dog--which he resembled both in temper and appearance--he\nmaintained his grip, and steadily dragged his victim toward the tree,\ndisregarding alike her blows, and the cries of the children for their\nmother’s release. He would, doubtless, have knocked her down with his\nhickory stick, but that such act might have cost him his place. It is\noften deemed advisable to knock a _man_ slave down, in order to tie him,\nbut it is considered cowardly and inexcusable, in an overseer, thus to\ndeal with a _woman_. He is expected to tie her up, and to give her what\nis called, in southern parlance, a “genteel flogging,” without any very\ngreat outlay of strength or skill. I watched, with palpitating interest,\nthe course of the preliminary struggle, and was saddened by every new\nadvantage gained over her by the ruffian. There were times when she\nseemed likely to get the better of the brute, but he finally overpowered\nher, and succeeded in getting his rope around her arms, and in firmly\ntying her to the tree, at which he had been aiming. This done, and Nelly\nwas at the mercy of his merciless lash; and now, what followed, I have\nno heart to describe. The cowardly creature made good his every threat;\nand wielded the lash with all the hot zest of furious revenge. The cries\nof the woman, while undergoing the terrible infliction, were mingled\nwith those of the children, sounds which I hope the reader may never be\ncalled upon to hear. When Nelly was untied, her back was covered\nwith blood. The red stripes were all over her shoulders. She was\nwhipped--severely whipped; but she was not subdued, for she continued to\ndenounce the overseer, and to call him every vile name. He had bruised\nher flesh, but had left her invincible spirit undaunted. Such floggings\nare seldom repeated by the same overseer. They prefer to whip those{74}\nwho are most easily whipped. The old doctrine that submission is the\nvery best cure for outrage and wrong, does not hold good on the slave\nplantation. He is whipped oftenest, who is whipped easiest; and that\nslave who has the courage to stand up for himself against the overseer,\nalthough he may have many hard stripes at the first, becomes, in the\nend, a freeman, even though he sustain the formal relation of a slave.\n“You can shoot me but you can’t whip me,” said a slave to Rigby Hopkins;\nand the result was that he was neither whipped nor shot. If the latter\nhad been his fate, it would have been less deplorable than the living\nand lingering death to which cowardly and slavish souls are subjected.\nI do not know that Mr. Sevier ever undertook to whip Nelly again. He\nprobably never did, for it was not long after his attempt to subdue her,\nthat he was taken sick, and died. The wretched man died as he had lived,\nunrepentant; and it was said--with how much truth I know not--that in\nthe very last hours of his life, his ruling passion showed itself,\nand that when wrestling with death, he was uttering horrid oaths, and\nflourishing the cowskin, as though he was tearing the flesh off some\nhelpless slave. One thing is certain, that when he was in health, it was\nenough to chill the blood, and to stiffen the hair of an ordinary man,\nto hear Mr. Sevier talk. Nature, or his cruel habits, had given to\nhis face an expression of unusual savageness, even for a slave-driver.\nTobacco and rage had worn his teeth short, and nearly every sentence\nthat escaped their compressed grating, was commenced or concluded with\nsome outburst of profanity. His presence made the field alike the field\nof blood, and of blasphemy. Hated for his cruelty, despised for his\ncowardice, his death was deplored by no one outside his own house--if\nindeed it was deplored there; it was regarded by the slaves as a\nmerciful interposition of Providence. Never went there a man to the\ngrave loaded with heavier curses. Mr. Sevier’s place was promptly taken\nby a Mr. Hopkins, and the change was quite a relief, he being a very\ndifferent man. He was, in{75} all respects, a better man than his\npredecessor; as good as any man can be, and yet be an overseer. His\ncourse was characterized by no extraordinary cruelty; and when he\nwhipped a slave, as he sometimes did, he seemed to take no especial\npleasure in it, but, on the contrary, acted as though he felt it to be\na mean business. Mr. Hopkins stayed but a short time; his place much\nto the regret of the slaves generally--was taken by a Mr. Gore, of whom\nmore will be said hereafter. It is enough, for the present, to say, that\nhe was no improvement on Mr. Sevier, except that he was less noisy and\nless profane.\n\nI have already referred to the business-like aspect of Col. Lloyd’s\nplantation. This business-like appearance was much increased on the two\ndays at the end of each month, when the slaves from the different farms\ncame to get their monthly allowance of meal and meat. These were gala\ndays for the slaves, and there was much rivalry among them as to _who_\nshould be elected to go up to the great house farm for the allowance,\nand, indeed, to attend to any business at this (for them) the capital.\nThe beauty and grandeur of the place, its numerous slave population,\nand the fact that Harry, Peter and Jake the sailors of the sloop--almost\nalways kept, privately, little trinkets which they bought at Baltimore,\nto sell, made it a privilege to come to the great house farm. Being\nselected, too, for this office, was deemed a high honor. It was taken as\na proof of confidence and favor; but, probably, the chief motive of the\ncompetitors for the place, was, a desire to break the dull monotony of\nthe field, and to get beyond the overseer’s eye and lash. Once on the\nroad with an ox team, and seated on the tongue of his cart, with no\noverseer to look after him, the slave was comparatively free; and, if\nthoughtful, he had time to think. Slaves are generally expected to sing\nas well as to work. A silent slave is not liked by masters or overseers.\n_“Make a noise,” “make a noise,”_ and _“bear a hand,”_ are the words\nusually addressed to the slaves when there is silence amongst them. This\nmay account for the almost constant singing{76} heard in the southern\nstates. There was, generally, more or less singing among the teamsters,\nas it was one means of letting the overseer know where they were, and\nthat they were moving on with the work. But, on allowance day, those who\nvisited the great house farm were peculiarly excited and noisy. While\non their way, they would make the dense old woods, for miles around,\nreverberate with their wild notes. These were not always merry because\nthey were wild. On the contrary, they were mostly of a plaintive cast,\nand told a tale of grief and sorrow. In the most boisterous outbursts of\nrapturous sentiment, there was ever a tinge of deep melancholy. I have\nnever heard any songs like those anywhere since I left slavery, except\nwhen in Ireland. There I heard the same _wailing notes_, and was much\naffected by them. It was during the famine of 1845-6. In all the songs\nof the slaves, there was ever some expression in praise of the great\nhouse farm; something which would flatter the pride of the owner, and,\npossibly, draw a favorable glance from him.\n\n            _I am going away to the great house farm,\n            O yea!  O yea!  O yea!\n            My old master is a good old master,\n            O yea!  O yea!  O yea!_\n\n\nThis they would sing, with other words of their own improvising--jargon\nto others, but full of meaning to themselves. I have sometimes thought,\nthat the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress truly\nspiritual-minded men and women with the soul-crushing and death-dealing\ncharacter of slavery, than the reading of whole volumes of its mere\nphysical cruelties. They speak to the heart and to the soul of the\nthoughtful. I cannot better express my sense of them now, than ten years\nago, when, in sketching my life, I thus spoke of this feature of my\nplantation experience:\n\n\nI did not, when a slave, understand the deep meanings of those rude, and\napparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle, so that I\nneither saw or heard as those without might see and hear. They told a\ntale which was{77} then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they\nwere tones, loud, long and deep, breathing the prayer and complaint\nof souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a\ntestimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from\nchains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirits, and\nfilled my heart with ineffable sadness. The mere recurrence, even now,\nafflicts my spirit, and while I am writing these lines, my tears are\nfalling. To those songs I trace my first glimmering conceptions of\nthe dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that\nconception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery,\nand quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to\nbe impressed with a sense of the soul-killing power of slavery, let him\ngo to Col. Lloyd’s plantation, and, on allowance day, place himself\nin the deep, pine woods, and there let him, in silence, thoughtfully\nanalyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul, and\nif he is not thus impressed, it will only be because “there is no flesh\nin his obdurate heart.”\n\n\nThe remark is not unfrequently made, that slaves are the most contended\nand happy laborers in the world. They dance and sing, and make all\nmanner of joyful noises--so they do; but it is a great mistake to\nsuppose them happy because they sing. The songs of the slave represent\nthe sorrows, rather than the joys, of his heart; and he is relieved\nby them, only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears. Such is the\nconstitution of the human mind, that, when pressed to extremes, it often\navails itself of the most opposite methods. Extremes meet in mind as\nin matter. When the slaves on board of the “Pearl” were overtaken,\narrested, and carried to prison--their hopes for freedom blasted--as\nthey marched in chains they sang, and found (as Emily Edmunson tells\nus) a melancholy relief in singing. The singing of a man cast away on a\ndesolate island, might be as appropriately considered an evidence of\nhis contentment and happiness, as the singing of a slave. Sorrow and\ndesolation have their songs, as well as joy and peace. Slaves sing more\nto _make_ themselves happy, than to express their happiness.\n\nIt is the boast of slaveholders, that their slaves enjoy more of the\nphysical comforts of life than the peasantry of any country in the\nworld. My experience contradicts this. The men and the women slaves on\nCol. Lloyd’s farm, received, as their monthly{78} allowance of food,\neight pounds of pickled pork, or their equivalent in fish. The pork was\noften tainted, and the fish was of the poorest quality--herrings, which\nwould bring very little if offered for sale in any northern market. With\ntheir pork or fish, they had one bushel of Indian meal--unbolted--of\nwhich quite fifteen per cent was fit only to feed pigs. With this, one\npint of salt was given; and this was the entire monthly allowance of\na full grown slave, working constantly in the open field, from morning\nuntil night, every day in the month except Sunday, and living on a\nfraction more than a quarter of a pound of meat per day, and less than\na peck of corn-meal per week. There is no kind of work that a man can do\nwhich requires a better supply of food to prevent physical exhaustion,\nthan the field-work of a slave. So much for the slave’s allowance of\nfood; now for his raiment. The yearly allowance of clothing for the\nslaves on this plantation, consisted of two tow-linen shirts--such linen\nas the coarsest crash towels are made of; one pair of trowsers of\nthe same material, for summer, and a pair of trowsers and a jacket\nof woolen, most slazily put together, for winter; one pair of yarn\nstockings, and one pair of shoes of the coarsest description. The\nslave’s entire apparel could not have cost more than eight dollars per\nyear. The allowance of food and clothing for the little children, was\ncommitted to their mothers, or to the older slavewomen having the care\nof them. Children who were unable to work in the field, had neither\nshoes, stockings, jackets nor trowsers given them. Their clothing\nconsisted of two coarse tow-linen shirts--already described--per year;\nand when these failed them, as they often did, they went naked until\nthe next allowance day. Flocks of little children from five to ten years\nold, might be seen on Col. Lloyd’s plantation, as destitute of clothing\nas any little heathen on the west coast of Africa; and this, not merely\nduring the summer months, but during the frosty weather of March. The\nlittle girls were no better off than the boys; all were nearly in a\nstate of nudity.{79}\n\nAs to beds to sleep on, they were known to none of the field hands;\nnothing but a coarse blanket--not so good as those used in the north to\ncover horses--was given them, and this only to the men and women. The\nchildren stuck themselves in holes and corners, about the quarters;\noften in the corner of the huge chimneys, with their feet in the ashes\nto keep them warm. The want of beds, however, was not considered a very\ngreat privation. Time to sleep was of far greater importance, for, when\nthe day’s work is done, most of the slaves have their washing, mending\nand cooking to do; and, having few or none of the ordinary facilities\nfor doing such things, very many of their sleeping hours are consumed in\nnecessary preparations for the duties of the coming day.\n\nThe sleeping apartments--if they may be called such--have little regard\nto comfort or decency. Old and young, male and female, married and\nsingle, drop down upon the common clay floor, each covering up with his\nor her blanket,--the only protection they have from cold or exposure.\nThe night, however, is shortened at both ends. The slaves work often as\nlong as they can see, and are late in cooking and mending for the coming\nday; and, at the first gray streak of morning, they are summoned to the\nfield by the driver’s horn.\n\nMore slaves are whipped for oversleeping than for any other fault.\nNeither age nor sex finds any favor. The overseer stands at the quarter\ndoor, armed with stick and cowskin, ready to whip any who may be a few\nminutes behind time. When the horn is blown, there is a rush for the\ndoor, and the hindermost one is sure to get a blow from the overseer.\nYoung mothers who worked in the field, were allowed an hour, about ten\no’clock in the morning, to go home to nurse their children. Sometimes\nthey were compelled to take their children with them, and to leave them\nin the corner of the fences, to prevent loss of time in nursing them.\nThe overseer generally rides about the field on horseback. A cowskin and\na hickory stick are his constant companions. The{80} cowskin is a\nkind of whip seldom seen in the northern states. It is made entirely\nof untanned, but dried, ox hide, and is about as hard as a piece of\nwell-seasoned live oak. It is made of various sizes, but the usual\nlength is about three feet. The part held in the hand is nearly an\ninch in thickness; and, from the extreme end of the butt or handle, the\ncowskin tapers its whole length to a point. This makes it quite elastic\nand springy. A blow with it, on the hardest back, will gash the flesh,\nand make the blood start. Cowskins are painted red, blue and green,\nand are the favorite slave whip. I think this whip worse than the\n“cat-o’nine-tails.” It condenses the whole strength of the arm to a\nsingle point, and comes with a spring that makes the air whistle. It\nis a terrible instrument, and is so handy, that the overseer can always\nhave it on his person, and ready for use. The temptation to use it is\never strong; and an overseer can, if disposed, always have cause for\nusing it. With him, it is literally a word and a blow, and, in most\ncases, the blow comes first.\n\nAs a general rule, slaves do not come to the quarters for either\nbreakfast or dinner, but take their “ash cake” with them, and eat it\nin the field. This was so on the home plantation; probably, because\nthe distance from the quarter to the field, was sometimes two, and even\nthree miles.\n\nThe dinner of the slaves consisted of a huge piece of ash cake, and a\nsmall piece of pork, or two salt herrings. Not having ovens, nor any\nsuitable cooking utensils, the slaves mixed their meal with a little\nwater, to such thickness that a spoon would stand erect in it; and,\nafter the wood had burned away to coals and ashes, they would place the\ndough between oak leaves and lay it carefully in the ashes, completely\ncovering it; hence, the bread is called ash cake. The surface of this\npeculiar bread is covered with ashes, to the depth of a sixteenth part\nof an inch, and the ashes, certainly, do not make it very grateful to\nthe teeth, nor render it very palatable. The bran, or coarse part of\nthe meal, is baked with the fine, and bright scales run through the\nbread.{81} This bread, with its ashes and bran, would disgust and choke\na northern man, but it is quite liked by the slaves. They eat it with\navidity, and are more concerned about the quantity than about the\nquality. They are far too scantily provided for, and are worked too\nsteadily, to be much concerned for the quality of their food. The few\nminutes allowed them at dinner time, after partaking of their coarse\nrepast, are variously spent. Some lie down on the “turning row,” and go\nto sleep; others draw together, and talk; and others are at work with\nneedle and thread, mending their tattered garments. Sometimes you may\nhear a wild, hoarse laugh arise from a circle, and often a song. Soon,\nhowever, the overseer comes dashing through the field. _“Tumble up!\nTumble up_, and to _work, work,”_ is the cry; and, now, from twelve\no’clock (mid-day) till dark, the human cattle are in motion, wielding\ntheir clumsy hoes; hurried on by no hope of reward, no sense of\ngratitude, no love of children, no prospect of bettering their\ncondition; nothing, save the dread and terror of the slave-driver’s\nlash. So goes one day, and so comes and goes another.\n\nBut, let us now leave the rough usage of the field, where vulgar\ncoarseness and brutal cruelty spread themselves and flourish, rank as\nweeds in the tropics; where a vile wretch, in the shape of a man,\nrides, walks, or struts about, dealing blows, and leaving gashes on\nbroken-spirited men and helpless women, for thirty dollars per month--a\nbusiness so horrible, hardening and disgraceful, that, rather, than\nengage in it, a decent man would blow his own brains out--and let the\nreader view with me the equally wicked, but less repulsive aspects of\nslave life; where pride and pomp roll luxuriously at ease; where the\ntoil of a thousand men supports a single family in easy idleness and\nsin. This is the great house; it is the home of the LLOYDS! Some idea of\nits splendor has already been given--and, it is here that we shall find\nthat height of luxury which is the opposite of that depth of poverty\nand physical wretchedness that we have just now been contemplating. But,\nthere is this difference in the two extremes;{82} viz: that in the\ncase of the slave, the miseries and hardships of his lot are imposed\nby others, and, in the master’s case, they are imposed by himself. The\nslave is a subject, subjected by others; the slaveholder is a subject,\nbut he is the author of his own subjection. There is more truth in the\nsaying, that slavery is a greater evil to the master than to the slave,\nthan many, who utter it, suppose. The self-executing laws of eternal\njustice follow close on the heels of the evil-doer here, as well as\nelsewhere; making escape from all its penalties impossible. But, let\nothers philosophize; it is my province here to relate and describe; only\nallowing myself a word or two, occasionally, to assist the reader in the\nproper understanding of the facts narrated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. _Life in the Great House_\n\nCOMFORTS AND LUXURIES--ELABORATE EXPENDITURE--HOUSE SERVANTS--MEN\nSERVANTS AND MAID SERVANTS--APPEARANCES--SLAVE ARISTOCRACY--STABLE AND\nCARRIAGE HOUSE--BOUNDLESS HOSPITALITY--FRAGRANCE OF RICH DISHES--THE\nDECEPTIVE CHARACTER OF SLAVERY--SLAVES SEEM HAPPY--SLAVES\nAND SLAVEHOLDERS ALIKE WRETCHED--FRETFUL DISCONTENT\nOF SLAVEHOLDERS--FAULT-FINDING--OLD BARNEY--HIS\nPROFESSION--WHIPPING--HUMILIATING SPECTACLE--CASE EXCEPTIONAL--WILLIAM\nWILKS--SUPPOSED SON OF COL. LLOYD--CURIOUS INCIDENT--SLAVES PREFER RICH\nMASTERS TO POOR ONES.\n\n\nThe close-fisted stinginess that fed the poor slave on coarse corn-meal\nand tainted meat; that clothed him in crashy tow-linen, and hurried him\nto toil through the field, in all weathers, with wind and rain beating\nthrough his tattered garments; that scarcely gave even the young\nslave-mother time to nurse her hungry infant in the fence corner; wholly\nvanishes on approaching the sacred precincts of the great house,\nthe home of the Lloyds. There the scriptural phrase finds an exact\nillustration; the highly favored inmates of this mansion are literally\narrayed “in purple and fine linen,” and fare sumptuously every day! The\ntable groans under the heavy and blood-bought luxuries gathered with\npainstaking care, at home and abroad. Fields, forests, rivers and seas,\nare made tributary here. Immense wealth, and its lavish expenditure,\nfill the great house with all that can please the eye, or tempt the\ntaste. Here, appetite, not food, is the great _desideratum_. Fish, flesh\nand fowl, are here in profusion. Chickens, of{84} all breeds; ducks,\nof all kinds, wild and tame, the common, and the huge Muscovite; Guinea\nfowls, turkeys, geese, and pea fowls, are in their several pens, fat and\nfatting for the destined vortex. The graceful swan, the mongrels, the\nblack-necked wild goose; partridges, quails, pheasants and pigeons;\nchoice water fowl, with all their strange varieties, are caught in this\nhuge family net. Beef, veal, mutton and venison, of the most select\nkinds and quality, roll bounteously to this grand consumer. The teeming\nriches of the Chesapeake bay, its rock, perch, drums, crocus, trout,\noysters, crabs, and terrapin, are drawn hither to adorn the glittering\ntable of the great house. The dairy, too, probably the finest on the\nEastern Shore of Maryland--supplied by cattle of the best English stock,\nimported for the purpose, pours its rich donations of fragant cheese,\ngolden butter, and delicious cream, to heighten the attraction of the\ngorgeous, unending round of feasting. Nor are the fruits of the\nearth forgotten or neglected. The fertile garden, many acres in\nsize, constituting a separate establishment, distinct from the common\nfarm--with its scientific gardener, imported from Scotland (a Mr.\nMcDermott) with four men under his direction, was not behind, either in\nthe abundance or in the delicacy of its contributions to the same full\nboard. The tender asparagus, the succulent celery, and the delicate\ncauliflower; egg plants, beets, lettuce, parsnips, peas, and French\nbeans, early and late; radishes, cantelopes, melons of all kinds; the\nfruits and flowers of all climes and of all descriptions, from the hardy\napple of the north, to the lemon and orange of the south, culminated at\nthis point. Baltimore gathered figs, raisins, almonds and juicy grapes\nfrom Spain. Wines and brandies from France; teas of various flavor, from\nChina; and rich, aromatic coffee from Java, all conspired to swell\nthe tide of high life, where pride and indolence rolled and lounged in\nmagnificence and satiety.\n\nBehind the tall-backed and elaborately wrought chairs, stand the\nservants, men and maidens--fifteen in number--discriminately selected,\nnot only with a view to their industry and faithfulness,{85} but with\nspecial regard to their personal appearance, their graceful agility and\ncaptivating address. Some of these are armed with fans, and are fanning\nreviving breezes toward the over-heated brows of the alabaster ladies;\nothers watch with eager eye, and with fawn-like step anticipate and\nsupply wants before they are sufficiently formed to be announced by word\nor sign.\n\nThese servants constituted a sort of black aristocracy on Col. Lloyd’s\nplantation. They resembled the field hands in nothing, except in color,\nand in this they held the advantage of a velvet-like glossiness, rich\nand beautiful. The hair, too, showed the same advantage. The delicate\ncolored maid rustled in the scarcely worn silk of her young mistress,\nwhile the servant men were equally well attired from the over-flowing\nwardrobe of their young masters; so that, in dress, as well as in form\nand feature, in manner and speech, in tastes and habits, the distance\nbetween these favored few, and the sorrow and hunger-smitten multitudes\nof the quarter and the field, was immense; and this is seldom passed\nover.\n\nLet us now glance at the stables and the carriage house, and we shall\nfind the same evidences of pride and luxurious extravagance. Here are\nthree splendid coaches, soft within and lustrous without. Here, too,\nare gigs, phaetons, barouches, sulkeys and sleighs. Here are saddles and\nharnesses--beautifully wrought and silver mounted--kept with every care.\nIn the stable you will find, kept only for pleasure, full thirty-five\nhorses, of the most approved blood for speed and beauty. There are two\nmen here constantly employed in taking care of these horses. One of\nthese men must be always in the stable, to answer every call from the\ngreat house. Over the way from the stable, is a house built expressly\nfor the hounds--a pack of twenty-five or thirty--whose fare would have\nmade glad the heart of a dozen slaves. Horses and hounds are not the\nonly consumers of the slave’s toil. There was practiced, at the\nLloyd’s, a hospitality which would have{86} astonished and charmed any\nhealth-seeking northern divine or merchant, who might have chanced\nto share it. Viewed from his own table, and _not_ from the field, the\ncolonel was a model of generous hospitality. His house was, literally,\na hotel, for weeks during the summer months. At these times, especially,\nthe air was freighted with the rich fumes of baking, boiling, roasting\nand broiling. The odors I shared with the winds; but the meats were\nunder a more stringent monopoly except that, occasionally, I got a cake\nfrom Mas’ Daniel. In Mas’ Daniel I had a friend at court, from whom\nI learned many things which my eager curiosity was excited to know. I\nalways knew when company was expected, and who they were, although I was\nan outsider, being the property, not of Col. Lloyd, but of a servant of\nthe wealthy colonel. On these occasions, all that pride, taste and money\ncould do, to dazzle and charm, was done.\n\nWho could say that the servants of Col. Lloyd were not well clad and\ncared for, after witnessing one of his magnificent entertainments? Who\ncould say that they did not seem to glory in being the slaves of such a\nmaster? Who, but a fanatic, could get up any sympathy for persons\nwhose every movement was agile, easy and graceful, and who evinced a\nconsciousness of high superiority? And who would ever venture to suspect\nthat Col. Lloyd was subject to the troubles of ordinary mortals? Master\nand slave seem alike in their glory here? Can it all be seeming?\nAlas! it may only be a sham at last! This immense wealth; this gilded\nsplendor; this profusion of luxury; this exemption from toil; this life\nof ease; this sea of plenty; aye, what of it all? Are the pearly gates\nof happiness and sweet content flung open to such suitors? _far from\nit!_ The poor slave, on his hard, pine plank, but scantily covered with\nhis thin blanket, sleeps more soundly than the feverish voluptuary who\nreclines upon his feather bed and downy pillow. Food, to the indolent\nlounger, is poison, not sustenance. Lurking beneath all their\ndishes, are invisible spirits of evil, ready to feed the self-deluded\ngormandizers{87} which aches, pains, fierce temper, uncontrolled\npassions, dyspepsia, rheumatism, lumbago and gout; and of these the\nLloyds got their full share. To the pampered love of ease, there is no\nresting place. What is pleasant today, is repulsive tomorrow; what is\nsoft now, is hard at another time; what is sweet in the morning, is\nbitter in the evening. Neither to the wicked, nor to the idler, is there\nany solid peace: _“Troubled, like the restless sea.”_\n\nI had excellent opportunities of witnessing the restless discontent and\nthe capricious irritation of the Lloyds. My fondness for horses--not\npeculiar to me more than to other boys attracted me, much of the time,\nto the stables. This establishment was especially under the care of\n“old” and “young” Barney--father and son. Old Barney was a fine looking\nold man, of a brownish complexion, who was quite portly, and wore a\ndignified aspect for a slave. He was, evidently, much devoted to his\nprofession, and held his office an honorable one. He was a farrier as\nwell as an ostler; he could bleed, remove lampers from the mouths of the\nhorses, and was well instructed in horse medicines. No one on the farm\nknew, so well as Old Barney, what to do with a sick horse. But his gifts\nand acquirements were of little advantage to him. His office was by\nno means an enviable one. He often got presents, but he got stripes as\nwell; for in nothing was Col. Lloyd more unreasonable and exacting,\nthan in respect to the management of his pleasure horses. Any supposed\ninattention to these animals were sure to be visited with degrading\npunishment. His horses and dogs fared better than his men. Their beds\nmust be softer and cleaner than those of his human cattle. No excuse\ncould shield Old Barney, if the colonel only suspected something\nwrong about his horses; and, consequently, he was often punished when\nfaultless. It was absolutely painful to listen to the many unreasonable\nand fretful scoldings, poured out at the stable, by Col. Lloyd, his sons\nand sons-in-law. Of the latter, he had three--Messrs. Nicholson, Winder\nand Lownes. These all{88} lived at the great house a portion of the\nyear, and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased,\nwhich was by no means unfrequently. A horse was seldom brought out of\nthe stable to which no objection could be raised. “There was dust in\nhis hair;” “there was a twist in his reins;” “his mane did not lie\nstraight;” “he had not been properly grained;” “his head did not look\nwell;” “his fore-top was not combed out;” “his fetlocks had not been\nproperly trimmed;” something was always wrong. Listening to complaints,\nhowever groundless, Barney must stand, hat in hand, lips sealed, never\nanswering a word. He must make no reply, no explanation; the judgment\nof the master must be deemed infallible, for his power is absolute\nand irresponsible. In a free state, a master, thus complaining without\ncause, of his ostler, might be told--“Sir, I am sorry I cannot please\nyou, but, since I have done the best I can, your remedy is to dismiss\nme.” Here, however, the ostler must stand, listen and tremble. One of\nthe most heart-saddening and humiliating scenes I ever witnessed, was\nthe whipping of Old Barney, by Col. Lloyd himself. Here were two men,\nboth advanced in years; there were the silvery locks of Col. L., and\nthere was the bald and toil-worn brow of Old Barney; master and slave;\nsuperior and inferior here, but _equals_ at the bar of God; and, in the\ncommon course of events, they must both soon meet in another world, in\na world where all distinctions, except those based on obedience and\ndisobedience, are blotted out forever. “Uncover your head!” said the\nimperious master; he was obeyed. “Take off your jacket, you old rascal!”\n and off came Barney’s jacket. “Down on your knees!” down knelt the old\nman, his shoulders bare, his bald head glistening in the sun, and\nhis aged knees on the cold, damp ground. In his humble and debasing\nattitude, the master--that master to whom he had given the best years\nand the best strength of his life--came forward, and laid on thirty\nlashes, with his horse whip. The old man bore it patiently, to the last,\nanswering each blow with a slight shrug of the shoulders, and a groan.\nI cannot think that{89} Col. Lloyd succeeded in marring the flesh of Old\nBarney very seriously, for the whip was a light, riding whip; but the\nspectacle of an aged man--a husband and a father--humbly kneeling before\na worm of the dust, surprised and shocked me at the time; and since I\nhave grown old enough to think on the wickedness of slavery, few facts\nhave been of more value to me than this, to which I was a witness. It\nreveals slavery in its true color, and in its maturity of repulsive\nhatefulness. I owe it to truth, however, to say, that this was the first\nand the last time I ever saw Old Barney, or any other slave, compelled\nto kneel to receive a whipping.\n\nI saw, at the stable, another incident, which I will relate, as it is\nillustrative of a phase of slavery to which I have already referred in\nanother connection. Besides two other coachmen, Col. Lloyd owned one\nnamed William, who, strangely enough, was often called by his surname,\nWilks, by white and colored people on the home plantation. Wilks was\na very fine looking man. He was about as white as anybody on the\nplantation; and in manliness of form, and comeliness of features, he\nbore a very striking resemblance to Mr. Murray Lloyd. It was whispered,\nand pretty generally admitted as a fact, that William Wilks was a son\nof Col. Lloyd, by a highly favored slave-woman, who was still on the\nplantation. There were many reasons for believing this whisper, not only\nin William’s appearance, but in the undeniable freedom which he enjoyed\nover all others, and his apparent consciousness of being something more\nthan a slave to his master. It was notorious, too, that William had a\ndeadly enemy in Murray Lloyd, whom he so much resembled, and that the\nlatter greatly worried his father with importunities to sell William.\nIndeed, he gave his father no rest until he did sell him, to Austin\nWoldfolk, the great slave-trader at that time. Before selling him,\nhowever, Mr. L. tried what giving William a whipping would do, toward\nmaking things smooth; but this was a failure. It was a compromise,\nand defeated itself; for,{90} immediately after the infliction, the\nheart-sickened colonel atoned to William for the abuse, by giving him\na gold watch and chain. Another fact, somewhat curious, is, that though\nsold to the remorseless _Woldfolk_, taken in irons to Baltimore and\ncast into prison, with a view to being driven to the south, William, by\n_some_ means--always a mystery to me--outbid all his purchasers, paid\nfor himself, _and now resides in Baltimore, a_ FREEMAN. Is there not\nroom to suspect, that, as the gold watch was presented to atone for the\nwhipping, a purse of gold was given him by the same hand, with which\nto effect his purchase, as an atonement for the indignity involved in\nselling his own flesh and blood. All the circumstances of William, on\nthe great house farm, show him to have occupied a different position\nfrom the other slaves, and, certainly, there is nothing in the supposed\nhostility of slaveholders to amalgamation, to forbid the supposition\nthat William Wilks was the son of Edward Lloyd. _Practical_ amalgamation\nis common in every neighborhood where I have been in slavery.\n\nCol. Lloyd was not in the way of knowing much of the real opinions and\nfeelings of his slaves respecting him. The distance between him and\nthem was far too great to admit of such knowledge. His slaves were so\nnumerous, that he did not know them when he saw them. Nor, indeed, did\nall his slaves know him. In this respect, he was inconveniently rich. It\nis reported of him, that, while riding along the road one day, he met a\ncolored man, and addressed him in the usual way of speaking to colored\npeople on the public highways of the south: “Well, boy, who do you\nbelong to?” “To Col. Lloyd,” replied the slave. “Well, does the colonel\ntreat you well?” “No, sir,” was the ready reply. “What? does he work you\ntoo hard?” “Yes, sir.” “Well, don’t he give enough to eat?” “Yes, sir,\nhe gives me enough, such as it is.” The colonel, after ascertaining\nwhere the slave belonged, rode on; the slave also went on about his\nbusiness, not dreaming that he had been conversing with his master. He\nthought, said and heard nothing more of the matter, until two or three\nweeks afterwards.{91} The poor man was then informed by his overseer,\nthat, for having found fault with his master, he was now to be sold to\na Georgia trader. He was immediately chained and handcuffed; and thus,\nwithout a moment’s warning he was snatched away, and forever sundered\nfrom his family and friends, by a hand more unrelenting than that of\ndeath. _This_ is the penalty of telling the simple truth, in answer to\na series of plain questions. It is partly in consequence of such facts,\nthat slaves, when inquired of as to their condition and the character of\ntheir masters, almost invariably say they are contented, and that their\nmasters are kind. Slaveholders have been known to send spies among their\nslaves, to ascertain, if possible, their views and feelings in regard to\ntheir condition. The frequency of this had the effect to establish\namong the slaves the maxim, that a still tongue makes a wise head. They\nsuppress the truth rather than take the consequence of telling it, and,\nin so doing, they prove themselves a part of the human family. If they\nhave anything to say of their master, it is, generally, something in his\nfavor, especially when speaking to strangers. I was frequently asked,\nwhile a slave, if I had a kind master, and I do not remember ever to\nhave given a negative reply. Nor did I, when pursuing this course,\nconsider myself as uttering what was utterly false; for I always\nmeasured the kindness of my master by the standard of kindness set up\nby slaveholders around us. However, slaves are like other people, and\nimbibe similar prejudices. They are apt to think _their condition_\nbetter than that of others. Many, under the influence of this prejudice,\nthink their own masters are better than the masters of other slaves; and\nthis, too, in some cases, when the very reverse is true. Indeed, it is\nnot uncommon for slaves even to fall out and quarrel among themselves\nabout the relative kindness of their masters, contending for the\nsuperior goodness of his own over that of others. At the very same time,\nthey mutually execrate their masters, when viewed separately. It was so\non our plantation. When Col. Lloyd’s slaves met those of Jacob Jepson,\nthey{92} seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters; Col.\nLloyd’s slaves contending that he was the richest, and Mr. Jepson’s\nslaves that he was the smartest, man of the two. Col. Lloyd’s slaves\nwould boost his ability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson; Mr. Jepson’s\nslaves would boast his ability to whip Col. Lloyd. These quarrels would\nalmost always end in a fight between the parties; those that beat were\nsupposed to have gained the point at issue. They seemed to think that\nthe greatness of their masters was transferable to themselves. To be a\nSLAVE, was thought to be bad enough; but to be a _poor man’s_ slave, was\ndeemed a disgrace, indeed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. _A Chapter of Horrors_\n\nAUSTIN GORE--A SKETCH OF HIS CHARACTER--OVERSEERS AS A CLASS--THEIR\nPECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS--THE MARKED INDIVIDUALITY OF AUSTIN\nGORE--HIS SENSE OF DUTY--HOW HE WHIPPED--MURDER OF POOR DENBY--HOW IT\nOCCURRED--SENSATION--HOW GORE MADE PEACE WITH COL. LLOYD--THE MURDER\nUNPUNISHED--ANOTHER DREADFUL MURDER NARRATED--NO LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION\nOF SLAVES CAN BE ENFORCED IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.\n\n\nAs I have already intimated elsewhere, the slaves on Col. Lloyd’s\nplantation, whose hard lot, under Mr. Sevier, the reader has already\nnoticed and deplored, were not permitted to enjoy the comparatively\nmoderate rule of Mr. Hopkins. The latter was succeeded by a very\ndifferent man. The name of the new overseer was Austin Gore. Upon this\nindividual I would fix particular attention; for under his rule there\nwas more suffering from violence and bloodshed than had--according to\nthe older slaves ever been experienced before on this plantation. I\nconfess, I hardly know how to bring this man fitly before the reader.\nHe was, it is true, an overseer, and possessed, to a large extent,\nthe peculiar characteristics of his class; yet, to call him merely an\noverseer, would not give the reader a fair notion of the man. I speak\nof overseers as a class. They are such. They are as distinct from the\nslaveholding gentry of the south, as are the fishwomen of Paris, and\nthe coal-heavers of London, distinct from other members of society. They\nconstitute a separate fraternity at the south, not less marked than is\nthe fraternity of Park Lane bullies in New York. They have been arranged\nand classified{94} by that great law of attraction, which determines the\nspheres and affinities of men; which ordains, that men, whose malign\nand brutal propensities predominate over their moral and intellectual\nendowments, shall, naturally, fall into those employments which\npromise the largest gratification to those predominating instincts\nor propensities. The office of overseer takes this raw material of\nvulgarity and brutality, and stamps it as a distinct class of southern\nsociety. But, in this class, as in all other classes, there are\ncharacters of marked individuality, even while they bear a general\nresemblance to the mass. Mr. Gore was one of those, to whom a general\ncharacterization would do no manner of justice. He was an overseer; but\nhe was something more. With the malign and tyrannical qualities of\nan overseer, he combined something of the lawful master. He had the\nartfulness and the mean ambition of his class; but he was wholly free\nfrom the disgusting swagger and noisy bravado of his fraternity. There\nwas an easy air of independence about him; a calm self-possession, and a\nsternness of glance, which might well daunt hearts less timid than those\nof poor slaves, accustomed from childhood and through life to cower\nbefore a driver’s lash. The home plantation of Col. Lloyd afforded an\nample field for the exercise of the qualifications for overseership,\nwhich he possessed in such an eminent degree.\n\nMr. Gore was one of those overseers, who could torture the slightest\nword or look into impudence; he had the nerve, not only to resent,\nbut to punish, promptly and severely. He never allowed himself to be\nanswered back, by a slave. In this, he was as lordly and as imperious as\nCol. Edward Lloyd, himself; acting always up to the maxim, practically\nmaintained by slaveholders, that it is better that a dozen slaves suffer\nunder the lash, without fault, than that the master or the overseer\nshould _seem_ to have been wrong in the presence of the slave.\n_Everything must be absolute here_. Guilty or not guilty, it is enough\nto be accused, to be sure of a flogging. The very presence of this\nman Gore was{95} painful, and I shunned him as I would have shunned a\nrattlesnake. His piercing, black eyes, and sharp, shrill voice, ever\nawakened sensations of terror among the slaves. For so young a man (I\ndescribe him as he was, twenty-five or thirty years ago) Mr. Gore was\nsingularly reserved and grave in the presence of slaves. He indulged\nin no jokes, said no funny things, and kept his own counsels. Other\noverseers, how brutal soever they might be, were, at times, inclined to\ngain favor with the slaves, by indulging a little pleasantry; but Gore\nwas never known to be guilty of any such weakness. He was always\nthe cold, distant, unapproachable _overseer_ of Col. Edward Lloyd’s\nplantation, and needed no higher pleasure than was involved in a\nfaithful discharge of the duties of his office. When he whipped, he\nseemed to do so from a sense of duty, and feared no consequences. What\nHopkins did reluctantly, Gore did with alacrity. There was a stern will,\nan iron-like reality, about this Gore, which would have easily made him\nthe chief of a band of pirates, had his environments been favorable to\nsuch a course of life. All the coolness, savage barbarity and freedom\nfrom moral restraint, which are necessary in the character of a\npirate-chief, centered, I think, in this man Gore. Among many other\ndeeds of shocking cruelty which he perpetrated, while I was at Mr.\nLloyd’s, was the murder of a young colored man, named Denby. He was\nsometimes called Bill Denby, or Demby; (I write from sound, and the\nsounds on Lloyd’s plantation are not very certain.) I knew him well. He\nwas a powerful young man, full of animal spirits, and, so far as I know,\nhe was among the most valuable of Col. Lloyd’s slaves. In something--I\nknow not what--he offended this Mr. Austin Gore, and, in accordance with\nthe custom of the latter, he under took to flog him. He gave Denby but\nfew stripes; the latter broke away from him and plunged into the creek,\nand, standing there to the depth of his neck in water, he refused to\ncome out at the order of the overseer; whereupon, for this refusal,\n_Gore shot him dead!_ It is said that Gore gave Denby three calls,\ntelling him that{96} if he did not obey the last call, he would shoot\nhim. When the third call was given, Denby stood his ground firmly; and\nthis raised the question, in the minds of the by-standing slaves--“Will\nhe dare to shoot?” Mr. Gore, without further parley, and without making\nany further effort to induce Denby to come out of the water, raised his\ngun deliberately to his face, took deadly aim at his standing victim,\nand, in an instant, poor Denby was numbered with the dead. His mangled\nbody sank out of sight, and only his warm, red blood marked the place\nwhere he had stood.\n\nThis devilish outrage, this fiendish murder, produced, as it was well\ncalculated to do, a tremendous sensation. A thrill of horror flashed\nthrough every soul on the plantation, if I may except the guilty wretch\nwho had committed the hell-black deed. While the slaves generally were\npanic-struck, and howling with alarm, the murderer himself was calm\nand collected, and appeared as though nothing unusual had happened. The\natrocity roused my old master, and he spoke out, in reprobation of it;\nbut the whole thing proved to be less than a nine days’ wonder. Both\nCol. Lloyd and my old master arraigned Gore for his cruelty in the\nmatter, but this amounted to nothing. His reply, or explanation--as\nI remember to have heard it at the time was, that the extraordinary\nexpedient was demanded by necessity; that Denby had become unmanageable;\nthat he had set a dangerous example to the other slaves; and that,\nwithout some such prompt measure as that to which he had resorted, were\nadopted, there would be an end to all rule and order on the plantation.\nThat very convenient covert for all manner of cruelty and outrage\nthat cowardly alarm-cry, that the slaves would _“take the place,”_ was\npleaded, in extenuation of this revolting crime, just as it had been\ncited in defense of a thousand similar ones. He argued, that if one\nslave refused to be corrected, and was allowed to escape with his life,\nwhen he had been told that he should lose it if he persisted in his\ncourse, the other slaves would soon copy his example; the result of\nwhich would be, the freedom of the slaves, and the enslavement of\nthe{97} whites. I have every reason to believe that Mr. Gore’s defense,\nor explanation, was deemed satisfactory--at least to Col. Lloyd. He was\ncontinued in his office on the plantation. His fame as an overseer\nwent abroad, and his horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial\ninvestigation. The murder was committed in the presence of slaves, and\nthey, of course, could neither institute a suit, nor testify against\nthe murderer. His bare word would go further in a court of law, than the\nunited testimony of ten thousand black witnesses.\n\nAll that Mr. Gore had to do, was to make his peace with Col. Lloyd. This\ndone, and the guilty perpetrator of one of the most foul murders goes\nunwhipped of justice, and uncensured by the community in which he lives.\nMr. Gore lived in St. Michael’s, Talbot county, when I left Maryland; if\nhe is still alive he probably yet resides there; and I have no reason\nto doubt that he is now as highly esteemed, and as greatly respected, as\nthough his guilty soul had never been stained with innocent blood. I am\nwell aware that what I have now written will by some be branded as false\nand malicious. It will be denied, not only that such a thing ever did\ntranspire, as I have now narrated, but that such a thing could happen in\n_Maryland_. I can only say--believe it or not--that I have said nothing\nbut the literal truth, gainsay it who may.\n\nI speak advisedly when I say this,--that killing a slave, or any colored\nperson, in Talbot county, Maryland, is not treated as a crime, either by\nthe courts or the community. Mr. Thomas Lanman, ship carpenter, of St.\nMichael’s, killed two slaves, one of whom he butchered with a hatchet,\nby knocking his brains out. He used to boast of the commission of the\nawful and bloody deed. I have heard him do so, laughingly, saying, among\nother things, that he was the only benefactor of his country in the\ncompany, and that when “others would do as much as he had done, we\nshould be relieved of the d--d niggers.”\n\nAs an evidence of the reckless disregard of human life where the life\nis that of a slave I may state the notorious fact, that the{98} wife of\nMr. Giles Hicks, who lived but a short distance from Col. Lloyd’s, with\nher own hands murdered my wife’s cousin, a young girl between fifteen\nand sixteen years of age--mutilating her person in a most shocking\nmanner. The atrocious woman, in the paroxysm of her wrath, not content\nwith murdering her victim, literally mangled her face, and broke her\nbreast bone. Wild, however, and infuriated as she was, she took the\nprecaution to cause the slave-girl to be buried; but the facts of the\ncase coming abroad, very speedily led to the disinterment of the remains\nof the murdered slave-girl. A coroner’s jury was assembled, who\ndecided that the girl had come to her death by severe beating. It was\nascertained that the offense for which this girl was thus hurried out of\nthe world, was this: she had been set that night, and several preceding\nnights, to mind Mrs. Hicks’s baby, and having fallen into a sound sleep,\nthe baby cried, waking Mrs. Hicks, but not the slave-girl. Mrs. Hicks,\nbecoming infuriated at the girl’s tardiness, after calling several\ntimes, jumped from her bed and seized a piece of fire-wood from the\nfireplace; and then, as she lay fast asleep, she deliberately pounded in\nher skull and breast-bone, and thus ended her life. I will not say that\nthis most horrid murder produced no sensation in the community. It _did_\nproduce a sensation; but, incredible to tell, the moral sense of the\ncommunity was blunted too entirely by the ordinary nature of slavery\nhorrors, to bring the murderess to punishment. A warrant was issued\nfor her arrest, but, for some reason or other, that warrant was never\nserved. Thus did Mrs. Hicks not only escape condign punishment, but even\nthe pain and mortification of being arraigned before a court of justice.\n\nWhilst I am detailing the bloody deeds that took place during my stay\non Col. Lloyd’s plantation, I will briefly narrate another dark\ntransaction, which occurred about the same time as the murder of Denby\nby Mr. Gore.\n\nOn the side of the river Wye, opposite from Col. Lloyd’s, there lived\na Mr. Beal Bondley, a wealthy slaveholder. In the direction{99} of his\nland, and near the shore, there was an excellent oyster fishing ground,\nand to this, some of the slaves of Col. Lloyd occasionally resorted in\ntheir little canoes, at night, with a view to make up the deficiency of\ntheir scanty allowance of food, by the oysters that they could easily\nget there. This, Mr. Bondley took it into his head to regard as a\ntrespass, and while an old man belonging to Col. Lloyd was engaged in\ncatching a few of the many millions of oysters that lined the bottom of\nthat creek, to satisfy his hunger, the villainous Mr. Bondley, lying in\nambush, without the slightest ceremony, discharged the contents of his\nmusket into the back and shoulders of the poor old man. As good fortune\nwould have it, the shot did not prove mortal, and Mr. Bondley came over,\nthe next day, to see Col. Lloyd--whether to pay him for his property,\nor to justify himself for what he had done, I know not; but this I _can_\nsay, the cruel and dastardly transaction was speedily hushed up; there\nwas very little said about it at all, and nothing was publicly done\nwhich looked like the application of the principle of justice to the\nman whom _chance_, only, saved from being an actual murderer. One of\nthe commonest sayings to which my ears early became accustomed, on Col.\nLloyd’s plantation and elsewhere in Maryland, was, that it was _“worth\nbut half a cent to kill a nigger, and a half a cent to bury him;”_ and\nthe facts of my experience go far to justify the practical truth of this\nstrange proverb. Laws for the protection of the lives of the slaves,\nare, as they must needs be, utterly incapable of being enforced, where\nthe very parties who are nominally protected, are not permitted to give\nevidence, in courts of law, against the only class of persons from whom\nabuse, outrage and murder might be reasonably apprehended. While I heard\nof numerous murders committed by slaveholders on the Eastern Shores of\nMaryland, I never knew a solitary instance in which a slaveholder was\neither hung or imprisoned for having murdered a slave. The usual pretext\nfor killing a slave is, that the slave has offered resistance. Should\na slave, when assaulted, but raise his hand in self defense, the white\nassaulting{100} party is fully justified by southern, or Maryland,\npublic opinion, in shooting the slave down. Sometimes this is done,\nsimply because it is alleged that the slave has been saucy. But here I\nleave this phase of the society of my early childhood, and will relieve\nthe kind reader of these heart-sickening details.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. _Personal Treatment_\n\nMISS LUCRETIA--HER KINDNESS--HOW IT WAS MANIFESTED--“IKE”--A BATTLE\nWITH HIM--THE CONSEQUENCES THEREOF--MISS LUCRETIA’S BALSAM--BREAD--HOW\nI OBTAINED IT--BEAMS OF SUNLIGHT AMIDST THE GENERAL DARKNESS--SUFFERING\nFROM COLD--HOW WE TOOK OUR MEALS--ORDERS TO PREPARE\nFOR BALTIMORE--OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT OF QUITTING THE\nPLANTATION--EXTRAORDINARY CLEANSING--COUSIN TOM’S VERSION OF\nBALTIMORE--ARRIVAL THERE--KIND RECEPTION GIVEN ME BY MRS. SOPHIA\nAULD--LITTLE TOMMY--MY NEW POSITION--MY NEW DUTIES--A TURNING POINT IN\nMY HISTORY.\n\n\nI have nothing cruel or shocking to relate of my own personal\nexperience, while I remained on Col. Lloyd’s plantation, at the home of\nmy old master. An occasional cuff from Aunt Katy, and a regular whipping\nfrom old master, such as any heedless and mischievous boy might get from\nhis father, is all that I can mention of this sort. I was not old enough\nto work in the field, and, there being little else than field work to\nperform, I had much leisure. The most I had to do, was, to drive up the\ncows in the evening, to keep the front yard clean, and to perform\nsmall errands for my young mistress, Lucretia Auld. I have reasons for\nthinking this lady was very kindly disposed toward me, and, although I\nwas not often the object of her attention, I constantly regarded her\nas my friend, and was always glad when it was my privilege to do her a\nservice. In a family where there was so much that was harsh, cold and\nindifferent, the slightest word or look of kindness passed, with me, for\nits full value. Miss Lucretia--as{102} we all continued to call her long\nafter her marriage--had bestowed upon me such words and looks as taught\nme that she pitied me, if she did not love me. In addition to words and\nlooks, she sometimes gave me a piece of bread and butter; a thing not\nset down in the bill of fare, and which must have been an extra ration,\nplanned aside from either Aunt Katy or old master, solely out of the\ntender regard and friendship she had for me. Then, too, I one day got\ninto the wars with Uncle Able’s son, “Ike,” and had got sadly worsted;\nin fact, the little rascal had struck me directly in the forehead with a\nsharp piece of cinder, fused with iron, from the old blacksmith’s forge,\nwhich made a cross in my forehead very plainly to be seen now. The gash\nbled very freely, and I roared very loudly and betook myself home.\nThe coldhearted Aunt Katy paid no attention either to my wound or my\nroaring, except to tell me it served me right; I had no business\nwith Ike; it was good for me; I would now keep away _“from dem Lloyd\nniggers.”_ Miss Lucretia, in this state of the case, came forward;\nand, in quite a different spirit from that manifested by Aunt Katy, she\ncalled me into the parlor (an extra privilege of itself) and, without\nusing toward me any of the hard-hearted and reproachful epithets of my\nkitchen tormentor, she quietly acted the good Samaritan. With her own\nsoft hand she washed the blood from my head and face, fetched her own\nbalsam bottle, and with the balsam wetted a nice piece of white linen,\nand bound up my head. The balsam was not more healing to the wound in my\nhead, than her kindness was healing to the wounds in my spirit, made\nby the unfeeling words of Aunt Katy. After this, Miss Lucretia was my\nfriend. I felt her to be such; and I have no doubt that the simple act\nof binding up my head, did much to awaken in her mind an interest in my\nwelfare. It is quite true, that this interest was never very marked, and\nit seldom showed itself in anything more than in giving me a piece\nof bread when I was hungry; but this was a great favor on a slave\nplantation, and I was the only one of the children to whom such\nattention was paid.{103} When very hungry, I would go into the back yard\nand play under Miss Lucretia’s window. When pretty severely pinched by\nhunger, I had a habit of singing, which the good lady very soon came to\nunderstand as a petition for a piece of bread. When I sung under Miss\nLucretia’s window, I was very apt to get well paid for my music.\nThe reader will see that I now had two friends, both at important\npoints--Mas’ Daniel at the great house, and Miss Lucretia at home.\nFrom Mas’ Daniel I got protection from the bigger boys; and from Miss\nLucretia I got bread, by singing when I was hungry, and sympathy when\nI was abused by that termagant, who had the reins of government in the\nkitchen. For such friendship I felt deeply grateful, and bitter as are\nmy recollections of slavery, I love to recall any instances of kindness,\nany sunbeams of humane treatment, which found way to my soul through the\niron grating of my house of bondage. Such beams seem all the brighter\nfrom the general darkness into which they penetrate, and the impression\nthey make is vividly distinct and beautiful.\n\nAs I have before intimated, I was seldom whipped--and never severely--by\nmy old master. I suffered little from the treatment I received, except\nfrom hunger and cold. These were my two great physical troubles. I could\nneither get a sufficiency of food nor of clothing; but I suffered less\nfrom hunger than from cold. In hottest summer and coldest winter, I was\nkept almost in a state of nudity; no shoes, no stockings, no jacket, no\ntrowsers; nothing but coarse sackcloth or tow-linen, made into a sort of\nshirt, reaching down to my knees. This I wore night and day, changing\nit once a week. In the day time I could protect myself pretty well,\nby keeping on the sunny side of the house; and in bad weather, in the\ncorner of the kitchen chimney. The great difficulty was, to keep warm\nduring the night. I had no bed. The pigs in the pen had leaves, and\nthe horses in the stable had straw, but the children had no beds. They\nlodged anywhere in the ample kitchen. I slept, generally, in a little\ncloset, without even a blanket to cover me. In very cold weather. I\nsometimes got down the bag in which corn{104} meal was usually carried\nto the mill, and crawled into that. Sleeping there, with my head in and\nfeet out, I was partly protected, though not comfortable. My feet have\nbeen so cracked with the frost, that the pen with which I am writing\nmight be laid in the gashes. The manner of taking our meals at old\nmaster’s, indicated but little refinement. Our corn-meal mush, when\nsufficiently cooled, was placed in a large wooden tray, or trough, like\nthose used in making maple sugar here in the north. This tray was set\ndown, either on the floor of the kitchen, or out of doors on the ground;\nand the children were called, like so many pigs; and like so many pigs\nthey would come, and literally devour the mush--some with oyster shells,\nsome with pieces of shingles, and none with spoons. He that eat fastest\ngot most, and he that was strongest got the best place; and few left the\ntrough really satisfied. I was the most unlucky of any, for Aunt Katy\nhad no good feeling for me; and if I pushed any of the other children,\nor if they told her anything unfavorable of me, she always believed the\nworst, and was sure to whip me.\n\nAs I grew older and more thoughtful, I was more and more filled with a\nsense of my wretchedness. The cruelty of Aunt Katy, the hunger and cold\nI suffered, and the terrible reports of wrong and outrage which came to\nmy ear, together with what I almost daily witnessed, led me, when yet\nbut eight or nine years old, to wish I had never been born. I used to\ncontrast my condition with the black-birds, in whose wild and sweet\nsongs I fancied them so happy! Their apparent joy only deepened\nthe shades of my sorrow. There are thoughtful days in the lives of\nchildren--at least there were in mine when they grapple with all\nthe great, primary subjects of knowledge, and reach, in a moment,\nconclusions which no subsequent experience can shake. I was just as well\naware of the unjust, unnatural and murderous character of slavery, when\nnine years old, as I am now. Without any appeal to books, to laws, or\nto authorities of any kind, it was enough to accept God as a father, to\nregard slavery as a crime.{105}\n\nI was not ten years old when I left Col. Lloyd’s plantation for\nBalitmore(sic). I left that plantation with inexpressible joy. I never\nshall forget the ecstacy with which I received the intelligence from my\nfriend, Miss Lucretia, that my old master had determined to let me go to\nBaltimore to live with Mr. Hugh Auld, a brother to Mr. Thomas Auld, my\nold master’s son-in-law. I received this information about three\ndays before my departure. They were three of the happiest days of my\nchildhood. I spent the largest part of these three days in the creek,\nwashing off the plantation scurf, and preparing for my new home. Mrs.\nLucretia took a lively interest in getting me ready. She told me I\nmust get all the dead skin off my feet and knees, before I could go to\nBaltimore, for the people there were very cleanly, and would laugh at me\nif I looked dirty; and, besides, she was intending to give me a pair of\ntrowsers, which I should not put on unless I got all the dirt off. This\nwas a warning to which I was bound to take heed; for the thought of\nowning a pair of trowsers, was great, indeed. It was almost a sufficient\nmotive, not only to induce me to scrub off the _mange_ (as pig drovers\nwould call it) but the skin as well. So I went at it in good earnest,\nworking for the first time in the hope of reward. I was greatly excited,\nand could hardly consent to sleep, lest I should be left. The ties that,\nordinarily, bind children to their homes, were all severed, or they\nnever had any existence in my case, at least so far as the home\nplantation of Col. L. was concerned. I therefore found no severe trail\nat the moment of my departure, such as I had experienced when separated\nfrom my home in Tuckahoe. My home at my old master’s was charmless to\nme; it was not home, but a prison to me; on parting from it, I could not\nfeel that I was leaving anything which I could have enjoyed by staying.\nMy mother was now long dead; my grandmother was far away, so that I\nseldom saw her; Aunt Katy was my unrelenting tormentor; and my two\nsisters and brothers, owing to our early separation in life, and the\nfamily-destroying power of slavery, were, comparatively, strangers{106}\nto me. The fact of our relationship was almost blotted out. I looked\nfor _home_ elsewhere, and was confident of finding none which I should\nrelish less than the one I was leaving. If, however, I found in my new\nhome to which I was going with such blissful anticipations--hardship,\nwhipping and nakedness, I had the questionable consolation that I\nshould not have escaped any one of these evils by remaining under the\nmanagement of Aunt Katy. Then, too, I thought, since I had endured much\nin this line on Lloyd’s plantation, I could endure as much elsewhere,\nand especially at Baltimore; for I had something of the feeling about\nthat city which is expressed in the saying, that being “hanged in\nEngland, is better than dying a natural death in Ireland.” I had the\nstrongest desire to see Baltimore. My cousin Tom--a boy two or three\nyears older than I--had been there, and though not fluent (he stuttered\nimmoderately) in speech, he had inspired me with that desire, by his\neloquent description of the place. Tom was, sometimes, Capt. Auld’s\ncabin boy; and when he came from Baltimore, he was always a sort of\nhero amongst us, at least till his Baltimore trip was forgotten. I could\nnever tell him of anything, or point out anything that struck me as\nbeautiful or powerful, but that he had seen something in Baltimore\nfar surpassing it. Even the great house itself, with all its pictures\nwithin, and pillars without, he had the hardihood to say “was nothing to\nBaltimore.” He bought a trumpet (worth six pence) and brought it home;\ntold what he had seen in the windows of stores; that he had heard\nshooting crackers, and seen soldiers; that he had seen a steamboat; that\nthere were ships in Baltimore that could carry four such sloops as the\n“Sally Lloyd.” He said a great deal about the market-house; he spoke of\nthe bells ringing; and of many other things which roused my curiosity\nvery much; and, indeed, which heightened my hopes of happiness in my new\nhome.\n\nWe sailed out of Miles river for Baltimore early on a Saturday morning.\nI remember only the day of the week; for, at that time,{107} I had no\nknowledge of the days of the month, nor, indeed, of the months of the\nyear. On setting sail, I walked aft, and gave to Col. Lloyd’s plantation\nwhat I hoped would be the last look I should ever give to it, or to any\nplace like it. My strong aversion to the great farm, was not owing to\nmy own personal suffering, but the daily suffering of others, and to the\ncertainty that I must, sooner or later, be placed under the barbarous\nrule of an overseer, such as the accomplished Gore, or the brutal and\ndrunken Plummer. After taking this last view, I quitted the quarter\ndeck, made my way to the bow of the sloop, and spent the remainder\nof the day in looking ahead; interesting myself in what was in the\ndistance, rather than what was near by or behind. The vessels, sweeping\nalong the bay, were very interesting objects. The broad bay opened\nlike a shoreless ocean on my boyish vision, filling me with wonder and\nadmiration.\n\nLate in the afternoon, we reached Annapolis, the capital of the state,\nstopping there not long enough to admit of my going ashore. It was the\nfirst large town I had ever seen; and though it was inferior to many a\nfactory village in New England, my feelings, on seeing it, were excited\nto a pitch very little below that reached by travelers at the first\nview of Rome. The dome of the state house was especially imposing, and\nsurpassed in grandeur the appearance of the great house. The great world\nwas opening upon me very rapidly, and I was eagerly acquainting myself\nwith its multifarious lessons.\n\nWe arrived in Baltimore on Sunday morning, and landed at Smith’s wharf,\nnot far from Bowly’s wharf. We had on board the sloop a large flock of\nsheep, for the Baltimore market; and, after assisting in driving them\nto the slaughter house of Mr. Curtis, on Loudon Slater’s Hill, I was\nspeedily conducted by Rich--one of the hands belonging to the sloop--to\nmy new home in Alliciana street, near Gardiner’s ship-yard, on Fell’s\nPoint. Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Auld, my new mistress and master, were both at\nhome, and met me at the door with their rosy cheeked little son, Thomas,\n{108} to take care of whom was to constitute my future occupation. In\nfact, it was to “little Tommy,” rather than to his parents, that old\nmaster made a present of me; and though there was no _legal_ form or\narrangement entered into, I have no doubt that Mr. and Mrs. Auld felt\nthat, in due time, I should be the legal property of their bright-eyed\nand beloved boy, Tommy. I was struck with the appearance, especially, of\nmy new mistress. Her face was lighted with the kindliest emotions; and\nthe reflex influence of her countenance, as well as the tenderness with\nwhich she seemed to regard me, while asking me sundry little questions,\ngreatly delighted me, and lit up, to my fancy, the pathway of my future.\nMiss Lucretia was kind; but my new mistress, “Miss Sophy,” surpassed\nher in kindness of manner. Little Thomas was affectionately told by his\nmother, that _“there was his Freddy,”_ and that “Freddy would take care\nof him;” and I was told to “be kind to little Tommy”--an injunction I\nscarcely needed, for I had already fallen in love with the dear boy;\nand with these little ceremonies I was initiated into my new home, and\nentered upon my peculiar duties, with not a cloud above the horizon.\n\nI may say here, that I regard my removal from Col. Lloyd’s plantation as\none of the most interesting and fortunate events of my life. Viewing it\nin the light of human likelihoods, it is quite probable that, but for\nthe mere circumstance of being thus removed before the rigors of slavery\nhad fastened upon me; before my young spirit had been crushed under the\niron control of the slave-driver, instead of being, today, a FREEMAN, I\nmight have been wearing the galling chains of slavery. I have sometimes\nfelt, however, that there was something more intelligent than _chance_,\nand something more certain than _luck_, to be seen in the circumstance.\nIf I have made any progress in knowledge; if I have cherished any\nhonorable aspirations, or have, in any manner, worthily discharged the\nduties of a member of an oppressed people; this little circumstance must\nbe allowed its due weight{109} in giving my life that direction. I have\never regarded it as the first plain manifestation of that\n\n                _Divinity that shapes our ends,\n                Rough hew them as we will_.\n\n\nI was not the only boy on the plantation that might have been sent to\nlive in Baltimore. There was a wide margin from which to select. There\nwere boys younger, boys older, and boys of the same age, belonging to\nmy old master some at his own house, and some at his farm--but the high\nprivilege fell to my lot.\n\nI may be deemed superstitious and egotistical, in regarding this event\nas a special interposition of Divine Providence in my favor; but the\nthought is a part of my history, and I should be false to the earliest\nand most cherished sentiments of my soul, if I suppressed, or hesitated\nto avow that opinion, although it may be characterized as irrational by\nthe wise, and ridiculous by the scoffer. From my earliest recollections\nof serious matters, I date the entertainment of something like an\nineffaceable conviction, that slavery would not always be able to hold\nme within its foul embrace; and this conviction, like a word of living\nfaith, strengthened me through the darkest trials of my lot. This good\nspirit was from God; and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. _Life in Baltimore_\n\nCITY ANNOYANCES--PLANTATION REGRETS--MY MISTRESS, MISS SOPHA--HER\nHISTORY--HER KINDNESS TO ME--MY MASTER, HUGH AULD--HIS SOURNESS--MY\nINCREASED SENSITIVENESS--MY COMFORTS--MY OCCUPATION--THE BANEFUL EFFECTS\nOF SLAVEHOLDING ON MY DEAR AND GOOD MISTRESS--HOW SHE COMMENCED TEACHING\nME TO READ--WHY SHE CEASED TEACHING ME--CLOUDS GATHERING OVER MY\nBRIGHT PROSPECTS--MASTER AULD’S EXPOSITION OF THE TRUE PHILOSOPHY OF\nSLAVERY--CITY SLAVES--PLANTATION SLAVES--THE CONTRAST--EXCEPTIONS--MR.\nHAMILTON’S TWO SLAVES, HENRIETTA AND MARY--MRS. HAMILTON’S CRUEL\nTREATMENT OF THEM--THE PITEOUS ASPECT THEY PRESENTED--NO POWER MUST COME\nBETWEEN THE SLAVE AND THE SLAVEHOLDER.\n\n\nOnce in Baltimore, with hard brick pavements under my feet, which almost\nraised blisters, by their very heat, for it was in the height of summer;\nwalled in on all sides by towering brick buildings; with troops of\nhostile boys ready to pounce upon me at every street corner; with new\nand strange objects glaring upon me at every step, and with startling\nsounds reaching my ears from all directions, I for a time thought that,\nafter all, the home plantation was a more desirable place of residence\nthan my home on Alliciana street, in Baltimore. My country eyes and ears\nwere confused and bewildered here; but the boys were my chief trouble.\nThey chased me, and called me _“Eastern Shore man,”_ till really I\nalmost wished myself back on the Eastern Shore. I had to undergo a sort\nof moral acclimation, and when that was over, I did much better. My new\nmistress happily proved to be all she _seemed_ to be, when, with her\nhusband, she met me at{111} the door, with a most beaming, benignant\ncountenance. She was, naturally, of an excellent disposition, kind,\ngentle and cheerful. The supercilious contempt for the rights and\nfeelings of the slave, and the petulance and bad humor which generally\ncharacterize slaveholding ladies, were all quite absent from kind “Miss”\n Sophia’s manner and bearing toward me. She had, in truth, never been\na slaveholder, but had--a thing quite unusual in the south--depended\nalmost entirely upon her own industry for a living. To this fact the\ndear lady, no doubt, owed the excellent preservation of her natural\ngoodness of heart, for slavery can change a saint into a sinner, and an\nangel into a demon. I hardly knew how to behave toward “Miss Sopha,”\n as I used to call Mrs. Hugh Auld. I had been treated as a _pig_ on the\nplantation; I was treated as a _child_ now. I could not even approach\nher as I had formerly approached Mrs. Thomas Auld. How could I hang down\nmy head, and speak with bated breath, when there was no pride to scorn\nme, no coldness to repel me, and no hatred to inspire me with fear? I\ntherefore soon learned to regard her as something more akin to a mother,\nthan a slaveholding mistress. The crouching servility of a slave,\nusually so acceptable a quality to the haughty slaveholder, was not\nunderstood nor desired by this gentle woman. So far from deeming\nit impudent in a slave to look her straight in the face, as some\nslaveholding ladies do, she seemed ever to say, “look up, child; don’t\nbe afraid; see, I am full of kindness and good will toward you.” The\nhands belonging to Col. Lloyd’s sloop, esteemed it a great privilege to\nbe the bearers of parcels or messages to my new mistress; for whenever\nthey came, they were sure of a most kind and pleasant reception. If\nlittle Thomas was her son, and her most dearly beloved child, she, for\na time, at least, made me something like his half-brother in her\naffections. If dear Tommy was exalted to a place on his mother’s knee,\n“Feddy” was honored by a place at his mother’s side. Nor did he lack\nthe caressing strokes of her gentle hand, to convince him that, though\n_motherless_, he was not _friendless_. Mrs. Auld{112} was not only\na kind-hearted woman, but she was remarkably pious; frequent in her\nattendance of public worship, much given to reading the bible, and to\nchanting hymns of praise, when alone. Mr. Hugh Auld was altogether a\ndifferent character. He cared very little about religion, knew more\nof the world, and was more of the world, than his wife. He set out,\ndoubtless to be--as the world goes--a respectable man, and to get on by\nbecoming a successful ship builder, in that city of ship building. This\nwas his ambition, and it fully occupied him. I was, of course, of very\nlittle consequence to him, compared with what I was to good Mrs. Auld;\nand, when he smiled upon me, as he sometimes did, the smile was borrowed\nfrom his lovely wife, and, like all borrowed light, was transient,\nand vanished with the source whence it was derived. While I must\ncharacterize Master Hugh as being a very sour man, and of forbidding\nappearance, it is due to him to acknowledge, that he was never very\ncruel to me, according to the notion of cruelty in Maryland. The first\nyear or two which I spent in his house, he left me almost exclusively to\nthe management of his wife. She was my law-giver. In hands so tender as\nhers, and in the absence of the cruelties of the plantation, I became,\nboth physically and mentally, much more sensitive to good and ill\ntreatment; and, perhaps, suffered more from a frown from my mistress,\nthan I formerly did from a cuff at the hands of Aunt Katy. Instead\nof the cold, damp floor of my old master’s kitchen, I found myself on\ncarpets; for the corn bag in winter, I now had a good straw bed, well\nfurnished with covers; for the coarse corn-meal in the morning, I now\nhad good bread, and mush occasionally; for my poor tow-lien shirt,\nreaching to my knees, I had good, clean clothes. I was really well off.\nMy employment was to run errands, and to take care of Tommy; to prevent\nhis getting in the way of carriages, and to keep him out of harm’s way\ngenerally. Tommy, and I, and his mother, got on swimmingly together, for\na time. I say _for a time_, because the fatal poison of irresponsible\npower, and the natural influence{113} of slavery customs, were not long\nin making a suitable impression on the gentle and loving disposition of\nmy excellent mistress. At first, Mrs. Auld evidently regarded me simply\nas a child, like any other child; she had not come to regard me as\n_property_. This latter thought was a thing of conventional growth. The\nfirst was natural and spontaneous. A noble nature, like hers, could not,\ninstantly, be wholly perverted; and it took several years to change the\nnatural sweetness of her temper into fretful bitterness. In her worst\nestate, however, there were, during the first seven years I lived with\nher, occasional returns of her former kindly disposition.\n\nThe frequent hearing of my mistress reading the bible for she often read\naloud when her husband was absent soon awakened my curiosity in respect\nto this _mystery_ of reading, and roused in me the desire to learn.\nHaving no fear of my kind mistress before my eyes, (she had then given\nme no reason to fear,) I frankly asked her to teach me to read; and,\nwithout hesitation, the dear woman began the task, and very soon, by her\nassistance, I was master of the alphabet, and could spell words of three\nor four letters. My mistress seemed almost as proud of my progress, as\nif I had been her own child; and, supposing that her husband would be as\nwell pleased, she made no secret of what she was doing for me. Indeed,\nshe exultingly told him of the aptness of her pupil, of her intention to\npersevere in teaching me, and of the duty which she felt it to teach\nme, at least to read _the bible_. Here arose the first cloud over my\nBaltimore prospects, the precursor of drenching rains and chilling\nblasts.\n\nMaster Hugh was amazed at the simplicity of his spouse, and, probably\nfor the first time, he unfolded to her the true philosophy of slavery,\nand the peculiar rules necessary to be observed by masters and\nmistresses, in the management of their human chattels. Mr. Auld promptly\nforbade continuance of her instruction; telling her, in the first place,\nthat the thing itself was unlawful; that it was also unsafe, and could\nonly lead to mischief. To use{114} his own words, further, he said, “if\nyou give a nigger an inch, he will take an ell;” “he should know nothing\nbut the will of his master, and learn to obey it.” “if you teach that\nnigger--speaking of myself--how to read the bible, there will be no\nkeeping him;” “it would forever unfit him for the duties of a slave;”\n and “as to himself, learning would do him no good, but probably, a great\ndeal of harm--making him disconsolate and unhappy.” “If you learn him\nnow to read, he’ll want to know how to write; and, this accomplished,\nhe’ll be running away with himself.” Such was the tenor of Master Hugh’s\noracular exposition of the true philosophy of training a human chattel;\nand it must be confessed that he very clearly comprehended the nature\nand the requirements of the relation of master and slave. His discourse\nwas the first decidedly anti-slavery lecture to which it had been my lot\nto listen. Mrs. Auld evidently felt the force of his remarks; and, like\nan obedient wife, began to shape her course in the direction indicated\nby her husband. The effect of his words, _on me_, was neither slight nor\ntransitory. His iron sentences--cold and harsh--sunk deep into my\nheart, and stirred up not only my feelings into a sort of rebellion, but\nawakened within me a slumbering train of vital thought. It was a new\nand special revelation, dispelling a painful mystery, against which my\nyouthful understanding had struggled, and struggled in vain, to wit: the\n_white_ man’s power to perpetuate the enslavement of the _black_ man.\n“Very well,” thought I; “knowledge unfits a child to be a slave.”\n I instinctively assented to the proposition; and from that moment I\nunderstood the direct pathway from slavery to freedom. This was just\nwhat I needed; and I got it at a time, and from a source, whence I least\nexpected it. I was saddened at the thought of losing the assistance of\nmy kind mistress; but the information, so instantly derived, to some\nextent compensated me for the loss I had sustained in this direction.\nWise as Mr. Auld was, he evidently underrated my comprehension, and\nhad little idea of the use to which I was capable of putting{115} the\nimpressive lesson he was giving to his wife. _He_ wanted me to be _a\nslave;_ I had already voted against that on the home plantation of Col.\nLloyd. That which he most loved I most hated; and the very determination\nwhich he expressed to keep me in ignorance, only rendered me the more\nresolute in seeking intelligence. In learning to read, therefore, I am\nnot sure that I do not owe quite as much to the opposition of my master,\nas to the kindly assistance of my amiable mistress. I acknowledge the\nbenefit rendered me by the one, and by the other; believing, that but\nfor my mistress, I might have grown up in ignorance.\n\nI had resided but a short time in Baltimore, before I observed a marked\ndifference in the manner of treating slaves, generally, from which I had\nwitnessed in that isolated and out-of-the-way part of the country where\nI began life. A city slave is almost a free citizen, in Baltimore,\ncompared with a slave on Col. Lloyd’s plantation. He is much better fed\nand clothed, is less dejected in his appearance, and enjoys privileges\naltogether unknown to the whip-driven slave on the plantation.\nSlavery dislikes a dense population, in which there is a majority of\nnon-slaveholders. The general sense of decency that must pervade such a\npopulation, does much to check and prevent those outbreaks of atrocious\ncruelty, and those dark crimes without a name, almost openly perpetrated\non the plantation. He is a desperate slaveholder who will shock\nthe humanity of his non-slaveholding neighbors, by the cries of the\nlacerated slaves; and very few in the city are willing to incur the\nodium of being cruel masters. I found, in Baltimore, that no man was\nmore odious to the white, as well as to the colored people, than he, who\nhad the reputation of starving his slaves. Work them, flog them, if need\nbe, but don’t starve them. These are, however, some painful exceptions\nto this rule. While it is quite true that most of the slaveholders in\nBaltimore feed and clothe their slaves well, there are others who keep\nup their country cruelties in the city.\n\nAn instance of this sort is furnished in the case of a family{116}\nwho lived directly opposite to our house, and were named Hamilton. Mrs.\nHamilton owned two slaves. Their names were Henrietta and Mary. They had\nalways been house slaves. One was aged about twenty-two, and the other\nabout fourteen. They were a fragile couple by nature, and the treatment\nthey received was enough to break down the constitution of a horse. Of\nall the dejected, emaciated, mangled and excoriated creatures I ever\nsaw, those two girls--in the refined, church going and Christian city\nof Baltimore were the most deplorable. Of stone must that heart be made,\nthat could look upon Henrietta and Mary, without being sickened to the\ncore with sadness. Especially was Mary a heart-sickening object.\nHer head, neck and shoulders, were literally cut to pieces. I have\nfrequently felt her head, and found it nearly covered over with\nfestering sores, caused by the lash of her cruel mistress. I do not know\nthat her master ever whipped her, but I have often been an eye witness\nof the revolting and brutal inflictions by Mrs. Hamilton; and what lends\na deeper shade to this woman’s conduct, is the fact, that, almost in the\nvery moments of her shocking outrages of humanity and decency, she would\ncharm you by the sweetness of her voice and her seeming piety. She used\nto sit in a large rocking chair, near the middle of the room, with a\nheavy cowskin, such as I have elsewhere described; and I speak within\nthe truth when I say, that these girls seldom passed that chair, during\nthe day, without a blow from that cowskin, either upon their bare arms,\nor upon their shoulders. As they passed her, she would draw her cowskin\nand give them a blow, saying, _“move faster, you black jip!”_ and,\nagain, _“take that, you black jip!”_ continuing, _“if you don’t move\nfaster, I will give you more.”_ Then the lady would go on, singing her\nsweet hymns, as though her _righteous_ soul were sighing for the holy\nrealms of paradise.\n\nAdded to the cruel lashings to which these poor slave-girls were\nsubjected--enough in themselves to crush the spirit of men--they were,\nreally, kept nearly half starved; they seldom knew{117} what it was to\neat a full meal, except when they got it in the kitchens of neighbors,\nless mean and stingy than the psalm-singing Mrs. Hamilton. I have seen\npoor Mary contending for the offal, with the pigs in the street. So much\nwas the poor girl pinched, kicked, cut and pecked to pieces, that the\nboys in the street knew her only by the name of _“pecked,”_ a name\nderived from the scars and blotches on her neck, head and shoulders.\n\nIt is some relief to this picture of slavery in Baltimore, to say--what\nis but the simple truth--that Mrs. Hamilton’s treatment of her slaves\nwas generally condemned, as disgraceful and shocking; but while I say\nthis, it must also be remembered, that the very parties who censured the\ncruelty of Mrs. Hamilton, would have condemned and promptly punished any\nattempt to interfere with Mrs. Hamilton’s _right_ to cut and slash\nher slaves to pieces. There must be no force between the slave and the\nslaveholder, to restrain the power of the one, and protect the weakness\nof the other; and the cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton is as justly chargeable\nto the upholders of the slave system, as drunkenness is chargeable\non those who, by precept and example, or by indifference, uphold the\ndrinking system.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. _“A Change Came O’er the Spirit of My Dream”_\n\nHOW I LEARNED TO READ--MY MISTRESS--HER SLAVEHOLDING DUTIES--THEIR\nDEPLORABLE EFFECTS UPON HER ORIGINALLY NOBLE NATURE--THE CONFLICT IN HER\nMIND--HER FINAL OPPOSITION TO MY LEARNING TO READ--TOO LATE--SHE HAD\nGIVEN ME THE INCH, I WAS RESOLVED TO TAKE THE ELL--HOW I PURSUED\nMY EDUCATION--MY TUTORS--HOW I COMPENSATED THEM--WHAT PROGRESS I\nMADE--SLAVERY--WHAT I HEARD SAID ABOUT IT--THIRTEEN YEARS OLD--THE\n_Columbian Orator_--A RICH SCENE--A DIALOGUE--SPEECHES OF CHATHAM,\nSHERIDAN, PITT AND FOX--KNOWLEDGE EVER INCREASING--MY EYES\nOPENED--LIBERTY--HOW I PINED FOR IT--MY SADNESS--THE DISSATISFACTION OF\nMY POOR MISTRESS--MY HATRED OF SLAVERY--ONE UPAS TREE OVERSHADOWED US\nBOTH.\n\n\nI lived in the family of Master Hugh, at Baltimore, seven years, during\nwhich time--as the almanac makers say of the weather--my condition\nwas variable. The most interesting feature of my history here, was my\nlearning to read and write, under somewhat marked disadvantages. In\nattaining this knowledge, I was compelled to resort to indirections by\nno means congenial to my nature, and which were really humiliating to\nme. My mistress--who, as the reader has already seen, had begun to teach\nme was suddenly checked in her benevolent design, by the strong advice\nof her husband. In faithful compliance with this advice, the good lady\nhad not only ceased to instruct me, herself, but had set her face as a\nflint against my learning to read by any means. It is due, however,\nto my mistress to say, that she did not adopt this course in all its\nstringency at the first. She either thought it unnecessary, or she\nlacked the depravity indispensable to shutting me up in{119} mental\ndarkness. It was, at least, necessary for her to have some training,\nand some hardening, in the exercise of the slaveholder’s prerogative,\nto make her equal to forgetting my human nature and character, and to\ntreating me as a thing destitute of a moral or an intellectual\nnature. Mrs. Auld--my mistress--was, as I have said, a most kind\nand tender-hearted woman; and, in the humanity of her heart, and the\nsimplicity of her mind, she set out, when I first went to live with her,\nto treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another.\n\nIt is easy to see, that, in entering upon the duties of a slaveholder,\nsome little experience is needed. Nature has done almost nothing to\nprepare men and women to be either slaves or slaveholders. Nothing but\nrigid training, long persisted in, can perfect the character of the one\nor the other. One cannot easily forget to love freedom; and it is as\nhard to cease to respect that natural love in our fellow creatures.\nOn entering upon the career of a slaveholding mistress, Mrs. Auld was\nsingularly deficient; nature, which fits nobody for such an office, had\ndone less for her than any lady I had known. It was no easy matter to\ninduce her to think and to feel that the curly-headed boy, who stood by\nher side, and even leaned on her lap; who was loved by little Tommy, and\nwho loved little Tommy in turn; sustained to her only the relation of a\nchattel. I was _more_ than that, and she felt me to be more than that.\nI could talk and sing; I could laugh and weep; I could reason and\nremember; I could love and hate. I was human, and she, dear lady, knew\nand felt me to be so. How could she, then, treat me as a brute, without\na mighty struggle with all the noble powers of her own soul. That\nstruggle came, and the will and power of the husband was victorious. Her\nnoble soul was overthrown; but, he that overthrew it did not, himself,\nescape the consequences. He, not less than the other parties, was\ninjured in his domestic peace by the fall.\n\nWhen I went into their family, it was the abode of happiness and\ncontentment. The mistress of the house was a model of affection{120}\nand tenderness. Her fervent piety and watchful uprightness made it\nimpossible to see her without thinking and feeling--“_that woman is a\nChristian_.” There was no sorrow nor suffering for which she had not a\ntear, and there was no innocent joy for which she did not a smile. She\nhad bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every\nmourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability\nto divest her of these excellent qualities, and her home of its early\nhappiness. Conscience cannot stand much violence. Once thoroughly broken\ndown, _who_ is he that can repair the damage? It may be broken toward\nthe slave, on Sunday, and toward the master on Monday. It cannot endure\nsuch shocks. It must stand entire, or it does not stand at all. If my\ncondition waxed bad, that of the family waxed not better. The first\nstep, in the wrong direction, was the violence done to nature and to\nconscience, in arresting the benevolence that would have enlightened my\nyoung mind. In ceasing to instruct me, she must begin to justify herself\n_to_ herself; and, once consenting to take sides in such a debate, she\nwas riveted to her position. One needs very little knowledge of moral\nphilosophy, to see _where_ my mistress now landed. She finally became\neven more violent in her opposition to my learning to read, than was her\nhusband himself. She was not satisfied with simply doing as _well_\nas her husband had commanded her, but seemed resolved to better his\ninstruction. Nothing appeared to make my poor mistress--after her\nturning toward the downward path--more angry, than seeing me, seated in\nsome nook or corner, quietly reading a book or a newspaper. I have\nhad her rush at me, with the utmost fury, and snatch from my hand such\nnewspaper or book, with something of the wrath and consternation which a\ntraitor might be supposed to feel on being discovered in a plot by some\ndangerous spy.\n\nMrs. Auld was an apt woman, and the advice of her husband, and her\nown experience, soon demonstrated, to her entire satisfaction, that\neducation and slavery are incompatible with each other. When this\nconviction was thoroughly established, I was{121} most narrowly watched\nin all my movements. If I remained in a separate room from the family\nfor any considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of\nhaving a book, and was at once called upon to give an account of myself.\nAll this, however, was entirely _too late_. The first, and never to be\nretraced, step had been taken. In teaching me the alphabet, in the days\nof her simplicity and kindness, my mistress had given me the _“inch,”_\nand now, no ordinary precaution could prevent me from taking the\n_“ell.”_\n\nSeized with a determination to learn to read, at any cost, I hit upon\nmany expedients to accomplish the desired end. The plea which I mainly\nadopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was that of using\nmy young white playmates, with whom I met in the streets as teachers. I\nused to carry, almost constantly, a copy of Webster’s spelling book in\nmy pocket; and, when sent of errands, or when play time was allowed\nme, I would step, with my young friends, aside, and take a lesson in\nspelling. I generally paid my _tuition fee_ to the boys, with bread,\nwhich I also carried in my pocket. For a single biscuit, any of my\nhungry little comrades would give me a lesson more valuable to me than\nbread. Not every one, however, demanded this consideration, for there\nwere those who took pleasure in teaching me, whenever I had a chance\nto be taught by them. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or\nthree of those little boys, as a slight testimonial of the gratitude and\naffection I bear them, but prudence forbids; not that it would injure\nme, but it might, possibly, embarrass them; for it is almost an\nunpardonable offense to do any thing, directly or indirectly, to\npromote a slave’s freedom, in a slave state. It is enough to say, of\nmy warm-hearted little play fellows, that they lived on Philpot street,\nvery near Durgin & Bailey’s shipyard.\n\nAlthough slavery was a delicate subject, and very cautiously talked\nabout among grown up people in Maryland, I frequently talked about\nit--and that very freely--with the white boys. I{122} would, sometimes,\nsay to them, while seated on a curb stone or a cellar door, “I wish\nI could be free, as you will be when you get to be men.” “You will be\nfree, you know, as soon as you are twenty-one, and can go where you\nlike, but I am a slave for life. Have I not as good a right to be free\nas you have?” Words like these, I observed, always troubled them; and I\nhad no small satisfaction in wringing from the boys, occasionally, that\nfresh and bitter condemnation of slavery, that springs from nature,\nunseared and unperverted. Of all consciences let me have those to deal\nwith which have not been bewildered by the cares of life. I do not\nremember ever to have met with a _boy_, while I was in slavery, who\ndefended the slave system; but I have often had boys to console me, with\nthe hope that something would yet occur, by which I might be made free.\nOver and over again, they have told me, that “they believed I had as\ngood a right to be free as _they_ had;” and that “they did not believe\nGod ever made any one to be a slave.” The reader will easily see, that\nsuch little conversations with my play fellows, had no tendency to\nweaken my love of liberty, nor to render me contented with my condition\nas a slave.\n\nWhen I was about thirteen years old, and had succeeded in learning\nto read, every increase of knowledge, especially respecting the\nFREE STATES, added something to the almost intolerable burden of the\nthought--I AM A SLAVE FOR LIFE. To my bondage I saw no end. It was\na terrible reality, and I shall never be able to tell how sadly that\nthought chafed my young spirit. Fortunately, or unfortunately, about\nthis time in my life, I had made enough money to buy what was then a\nvery popular school book, viz: the _Columbian Orator_. I bought this\naddition to my library, of Mr. Knight, on Thames street, Fell’s Point,\nBaltimore, and paid him fifty cents for it. I was first led to buy this\nbook, by hearing some little boys say they were going to learn some\nlittle pieces out of it for the Exhibition. This volume was, indeed, a\nrich treasure, and every opportunity afforded me, for{123} a time, was\nspent in diligently perusing it. Among much other interesting matter,\nthat which I had perused and reperused with unflagging satisfaction,\nwas a short dialogue between a master and his slave. The slave is\nrepresented as having been recaptured, in a second attempt to run away;\nand the master opens the dialogue with an upbraiding speech, charging\nthe slave with ingratitude, and demanding to know what he has to say\nin his own defense. Thus upbraided, and thus called upon to reply, the\nslave rejoins, that he knows how little anything that he can say will\navail, seeing that he is completely in the hands of his owner; and with\nnoble resolution, calmly says, “I submit to my fate.” Touched by the\nslave’s answer, the master insists upon his further speaking, and\nrecapitulates the many acts of kindness which he has performed toward\nthe slave, and tells him he is permitted to speak for himself. Thus\ninvited to the debate, the quondam slave made a spirited defense of\nhimself, and thereafter the whole argument, for and against slavery, was\nbrought out. The master was vanquished at every turn in the argument;\nand seeing himself to be thus vanquished, he generously and meekly\nemancipates the slave, with his best wishes for his prosperity. It is\nscarcely neccessary(sic) to say, that a dialogue, with such an origin,\nand such an ending--read when the fact of my being a slave was a\nconstant burden of grief--powerfully affected me; and I could not help\nfeeling that the day might come, when the well-directed answers made by\nthe slave to the master, in this instance, would find their counterpart\nin myself.\n\nThis, however, was not all the fanaticism which I found in this\n_Columbian Orator_. I met there one of Sheridan’s mighty speeches,\non the subject of Catholic Emancipation, Lord Chatham’s speech on the\nAmerican war, and speeches by the great William Pitt and by Fox. These\nwere all choice documents to me, and I read them, over and over again,\nwith an interest that was ever increasing, because it was ever gaining\nin intelligence; for the more I read them, the better I understood them.\nThe reading of{124} these speeches added much to my limited stock of\nlanguage, and enabled me to give tongue to many interesting thoughts,\nwhich had frequently flashed through my soul, and died away for want\nof utterance. The mighty power and heart-searching directness of truth,\npenetrating even the heart of a slaveholder, compelling him to yield\nup his earthly interests to the claims of eternal justice, were finely\nillustrated in the dialogue, just referred to; and from the speeches of\nSheridan, I got a bold and powerful denunciation of oppression, and a\nmost brilliant vindication of the rights of man. Here was, indeed, a\nnoble acquisition. If I ever wavered under the consideration, that the\nAlmighty, in some way, ordained slavery, and willed my enslavement for\nhis own glory, I wavered no longer. I had now penetrated the secret of\nall slavery and oppression, and had ascertained their true foundation to\nbe in the pride, the power and the avarice of man. The dialogue and\nthe speeches were all redolent of the principles of liberty, and poured\nfloods of light on the nature and character of slavery. With a book\nof this kind in my hand, my own human nature, and the facts of my\nexperience, to help me, I was equal to a contest with the religious\nadvocates of slavery, whether among the whites or among the colored\npeople, for blindness, in this matter, is not confined to the former. I\nhave met many religious colored people, at the south, who are under the\ndelusion that God requires them to submit to slavery, and to wear their\nchains with meekness and humility. I could entertain no such nonsense\nas this; and I almost lost my patience when I found any colored man weak\nenough to believe such stuff. Nevertheless, the increase of knowledge\nwas attended with bitter, as well as sweet results. The more I read,\nthe more I was led to abhor and detest slavery, and my enslavers.\n“Slaveholders,” thought I, “are only a band of successful robbers, who\nleft their homes and went into Africa for the purpose of stealing and\nreducing my people to slavery.” I loathed them as the meanest and\nthe most wicked of men. As I read, behold! the very discontent so\ngraphically pre{125} dicted by Master Hugh, had already come upon me. I\nwas no longer the light-hearted, gleesome boy, full of mirth and play,\nas when I landed first at Baltimore. Knowledge had come; light had\npenetrated the moral dungeon where I dwelt; and, behold! there lay the\nbloody whip, for my back, and here was the iron chain; and my good,\n_kind master_, he was the author of my situation. The revelation haunted\nme, stung me, and made me gloomy and miserable. As I writhed under the\nsting and torment of this knowledge, I almost envied my fellow slaves\ntheir stupid contentment. This knowledge opened my eyes to the horrible\npit, and revealed the teeth of the frightful dragon that was ready to\npounce upon me, but it opened no way for my escape. I have often wished\nmyself a beast, or a bird--anything, rather than a slave. I was wretched\nand gloomy, beyond my ability to describe. I was too thoughtful to be\nhappy. It was this everlasting thinking which distressed and tormented\nme; and yet there was no getting rid of the subject of my thoughts.\nAll nature was redolent of it. Once awakened by the silver trump of\nknowledge, my spirit was roused to eternal wakefulness. Liberty! the\ninestimable birthright of every man, had, for me, converted every object\ninto an asserter of this great right. It was heard in every sound, and\nbeheld in every object. It was ever present, to torment me with a sense\nof my wretched condition. The more beautiful and charming were the\nsmiles of nature, the more horrible and desolate was my condition. I saw\nnothing without seeing it, and I heard nothing without hearing it. I do\nnot exaggerate, when I say, that it looked from every star, smiled in\nevery calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in every storm.\n\nI have no doubt that my state of mind had something to do with the\nchange in the treatment adopted, by my once kind mistress toward me. I\ncan easily believe, that my leaden, downcast, and discontented look,\nwas very offensive to her. Poor lady! She did not know my trouble, and\nI dared not tell her. Could I have freely made her acquainted with the\nreal state of my mind, and{126} given her the reasons therefor, it\nmight have been well for both of us. Her abuse of me fell upon me like\nthe blows of the false prophet upon his ass; she did not know that an\n_angel_ stood in the way; and--such is the relation of master and slave\nI could not tell her. Nature had made us _friends;_ slavery made us\n_enemies_. My interests were in a direction opposite to hers, and we\nboth had our private thoughts and plans. She aimed to keep me ignorant;\nand I resolved to know, although knowledge only increased my discontent.\nMy feelings were not the result of any marked cruelty in the treatment I\nreceived; they sprung from the consideration of my being a slave at all.\nIt was _slavery_--not its mere _incidents_--that I hated. I had been\ncheated. I saw through the attempt to keep me in ignorance; I saw that\nslaveholders would have gladly made me believe that they were merely\nacting under the authority of God, in making a slave of me, and in\nmaking slaves of others; and I treated them as robbers and deceivers.\nThe feeding and clothing me well, could not atone for taking my liberty\nfrom me. The smiles of my mistress could not remove the deep sorrow that\ndwelt in my young bosom. Indeed, these, in time, came only to deepen\nmy sorrow. She had changed; and the reader will see that I had changed,\ntoo. We were both victims to the same overshadowing evil--_she_, as\nmistress, I, as slave. I will not censure her harshly; she cannot\ncensure me, for she knows I speak but the truth, and have acted in\nmy opposition to slavery, just as she herself would have acted, in a\nreverse of circumstances.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. _Religious Nature Awakened_\n\nABOLITIONISTS SPOKEN OF--MY EAGERNESS TO KNOW WHAT THIS WORD MEANT--MY\nCONSULTATION OF THE DICTIONARY--INCENDIARY INFORMATION--HOW AND WHERE\nDERIVED--THE ENIGMA SOLVED--NATHANIEL TURNER’S INSURRECTION--THE\nCHOLERA--RELIGION--FIRST AWAKENED BY A METHODIST MINISTER NAMED\nHANSON--MY DEAR AND GOOD OLD COLORED FRIEND, LAWSON--HIS CHARACTER AND\nOCCUPATION--HIS INFLUENCE OVER ME--OUR MUTUAL ATTACHMENT--THE COMFORT\nI DERIVED FROM HIS TEACHING--NEW HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS--HEAVENLY\nLIGHT AMIDST EARTHLY DARKNESS--THE TWO IRISHMEN ON THE WHARF--THEIR\nCONVERSATION--HOW I LEARNED TO WRITE--WHAT WERE MY AIMS.\n\n\nWhilst in the painful state of mind described in the foregoing chapter,\nalmost regretting my very existence, because doomed to a life of\nbondage, so goaded and so wretched, at times, that I was even tempted to\ndestroy my own life, I was keenly sensitive and eager to know any,\nand every thing that transpired, having any relation to the subject of\nslavery. I was all ears, all eyes, whenever the words _slave, slavery_,\ndropped from the lips of any white person, and the occasions were not\nunfrequent when these words became leading ones, in high, social debate,\nat our house. Every little while, I could hear Master Hugh, or some\nof his company, speaking with much warmth and excitement about\n_“abolitionists.”_ Of _who_ or _what_ these were, I was totally\nignorant. I found, however, that whatever they might be, they were most\ncordially hated and soundly abused by slaveholders, of every grade. I\nvery soon discovered, too, that slavery was, in some{128} sort, under\nconsideration, whenever the abolitionists were alluded to. This made the\nterm a very interesting one to me. If a slave, for instance, had made\ngood his escape from slavery, it was generally alleged, that he had been\npersuaded and assisted by the abolitionists. If, also, a slave killed\nhis master--as was sometimes the case--or struck down his overseer, or\nset fire to his master’s dwelling, or committed any violence or crime,\nout of the common way, it was certain to be said, that such a crime was\nthe legitimate fruits of the abolition movement. Hearing such charges\noften repeated, I, naturally enough, received the impression that\nabolition--whatever else it might be--could not be unfriendly to the\nslave, nor very friendly to the slaveholder. I therefore set about\nfinding out, if possible, _who_ and _what_ the abolitionists were,\nand _why_ they were so obnoxious to the slaveholders. The dictionary\nafforded me very little help. It taught me that abolition was the “act\nof abolishing;” but it left me in ignorance at the very point where\nI most wanted information--and that was, as to the _thing_ to be\nabolished. A city newspaper, the _Baltimore American_, gave me the\nincendiary information denied me by the dictionary. In its columns I\nfound, that, on a certain day, a vast number of petitions and memorials\nhad been presented to congress, praying for the abolition of slavery\nin the District of Columbia, and for the abolition of the slave trade\nbetween the states of the Union. This was enough. The vindictive\nbitterness, the marked caution, the studied reverse, and the cumbrous\nambiguity, practiced by our white folks, when alluding to this subject,\nwas now fully explained. Ever, after that, when I heard the words\n“abolition,” or “abolition movement,” mentioned, I felt the matter one\nof a personal concern; and I drew near to listen, when I could do so,\nwithout seeming too solicitous and prying. There was HOPE in those\nwords. Ever and anon, too, I could see some terrible denunciation of\nslavery, in our papers--copied from abolition papers at the north--and\nthe injustice of such denunciation commented on. These I read with\navidity.{129} I had a deep satisfaction in the thought, that the\nrascality of slaveholders was not concealed from the eyes of the world,\nand that I was not alone in abhorring the cruelty and brutality of\nslavery. A still deeper train of thought was stirred. I saw that\nthere was _fear_, as well as _rage_, in the manner of speaking of the\nabolitionists. The latter, therefore, I was compelled to regard as\nhaving some power in the country; and I felt that they might, possibly,\nsucceed in their designs. When I met with a slave to whom I deemed\nit safe to talk on the subject, I would impart to him so much of the\nmystery as I had been able to penetrate. Thus, the light of this grand\nmovement broke in upon my mind, by degrees; and I must say, that,\nignorant as I then was of the philosophy of that movement, I believe in\nit from the first--and I believed in it, partly, because I saw that it\nalarmed the consciences of slaveholders. The insurrection of Nathaniel\nTurner had been quelled, but the alarm and terror had not subsided. The\ncholera was on its way, and the thought was present, that God was angry\nwith the white people because of their slaveholding wickedness, and,\ntherefore, his judgments were abroad in the land. It was impossible for\nme not to hope much from the abolition movement, when I saw it supported\nby the Almighty, and armed with DEATH!\n\nPrevious to my contemplation of the anti-slavery movement, and its\nprobable results, my mind had been seriously awakened to the subject of\nreligion. I was not more than thirteen years old, when I felt the need\nof God, as a father and protector. My religious nature was awakened by\nthe preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson. He thought\nthat all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight\nof God; that they were, by nature, rebels against His government; and\nthat they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God, through\nChrist. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was\nrequired of me; but one thing I knew very well--I was wretched, and had\nno means of making myself otherwise. Moreover, I knew that I could pray\nfor light. I consulted a good colored man, named{130} Charles Johnson;\nand, in tones of holy affection, he told me to pray, and what to pray\nfor. I was, for weeks, a poor, brokenhearted mourner, traveling through\nthe darkness and misery of doubts and fears. I finally found that change\nof heart which comes by “casting all one’s care” upon God, and by having\nfaith in Jesus Christ, as the Redeemer, Friend, and Savior of those who\ndiligently seek Him.\n\nAfter this, I saw the world in a new light. I seemed to live in a new\nworld, surrounded by new objects, and to be animated by new hopes\nand desires. I loved all mankind--slaveholders not excepted; though I\nabhorred slavery more than ever. My great concern was, now, to have the\nworld converted. The desire for knowledge increased, and especially did\nI want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the bible. I have\ngathered scattered pages from this holy book, from the filthy street\ngutters of Baltimore, and washed and dried them, that in the moments of\nmy leisure, I might get a word or two of wisdom from them. While thus\nreligiously seeking knowledge, I became acquainted with a good old\ncolored man, named Lawson. A more devout man than he, I never saw. He\ndrove a dray for Mr. James Ramsey, the owner of a rope-walk on Fell’s\nPoint, Baltimore. This man not only prayed three time a day, but he\nprayed as he walked through the streets, at his work--on his dray\neverywhere. His life was a life of prayer, and his words (when he spoke\nto his friends,) were about a better world. Uncle Lawson lived near\nMaster Hugh’s house; and, becoming deeply attached to the old man, I\nwent often with him to prayer-meeting, and spent much of my leisure time\nwith him on Sunday. The old man could read a little, and I was a great\nhelp to him, in making out the hard words, for I was a better reader\nthan he. I could teach him _“the letter,”_ but he could teach me _“the\nspirit;”_ and high, refreshing times we had together, in singing,\npraying and glorifying God. These meetings with Uncle Lawson went on for\na long time, without the knowledge of Master Hugh or my mistress. Both\nknew, how{131} ever, that I had become religious, and they seemed to\nrespect my conscientious piety. My mistress was still a professor of\nreligion, and belonged to class. Her leader was no less a person than\nthe Rev. Beverly Waugh, the presiding elder, and now one of the bishops\nof the Methodist Episcopal church. Mr. Waugh was then stationed over\nWilk street church. I am careful to state these facts, that the reader\nmay be able to form an idea of the precise influences which had to do\nwith shaping and directing my mind.\n\nIn view of the cares and anxieties incident to the life she was then\nleading, and, especially, in view of the separation from religious\nassociations to which she was subjected, my mistress had, as I have\nbefore stated, become lukewarm, and needed to be looked up by her\nleader. This brought Mr. Waugh to our house, and gave me an opportunity\nto hear him exhort and pray. But my chief instructor, in matters of\nreligion, was Uncle Lawson. He was my spiritual father; and I loved him\nintensely, and was at his house every chance I got.\n\nThis pleasure was not long allowed me. Master Hugh became averse to my\ngoing to Father Lawson’s, and threatened to whip me if I ever went there\nagain. I now felt myself persecuted by a wicked man; and I _would_ go to\nFather Lawson’s, notwithstanding the threat. The good old man had told\nme, that the “Lord had a great work for me to do;” and I must prepare\nto do it; and that he had been shown that I must preach the gospel. His\nwords made a deep impression on my mind, and I verily felt that some\nsuch work was before me, though I could not see _how_ I should ever\nengage in its performance. “The good Lord,” he said, “would bring it to\npass in his own good time,” and that I must go on reading and studying\nthe scriptures. The advice and the suggestions of Uncle Lawson, were\nnot without their influence upon my character and destiny. He threw my\nthoughts into a channel from which they have never entirely diverged. He\nfanned my already intense love of knowledge into a flame, by assuring\nme that I was to be a useful man in the world. When I would{132} say\nto him, “How can these things be and what can _I_ do?” his simple reply\nwas, _“Trust in the Lord.”_ When I told him that “I was a slave, and\na slave FOR LIFE,” he said, “the Lord can make you free, my dear. All\nthings are possible with him, only _have faith in God.”_ “Ask, and it\nshall be given.” “If you want liberty,” said the good old man, “ask the\nLord for it, _in faith_, AND HE WILL GIVE IT TO YOU.”\n\nThus assured, and cheered on, under the inspiration of hope, I worked\nand prayed with a light heart, believing that my life was under the\nguidance of a wisdom higher than my own. With all other blessings sought\nat the mercy seat, I always prayed that God would, of His great mercy,\nand in His own good time, deliver me from my bondage.\n\nI went, one day, on the wharf of Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen\nunloading a large scow of stone, or ballast I went on board, unasked,\nand helped them. When we had finished the work, one of the men came to\nme, aside, and asked me a number of questions, and among them, if I\nwere a slave. I told him “I was a slave, and a slave for life.” The good\nIrishman gave his shoulders a shrug, and seemed deeply affected by the\nstatement. He said, “it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself\nshould be a slave for life.” They both had much to say about the matter,\nand expressed the deepest sympathy with me, and the most decided hatred\nof slavery. They went so far as to tell me that I ought to run away, and\ngo to the north; that I should find friends there, and that I would be\nas free as anybody. I, however, pretended not to be interested in what\nthey said, for I feared they might be treacherous. White men have been\nknown to encourage slaves to escape, and then--to get the reward--they\nhave kidnapped them, and returned them to their masters. And while I\nmainly inclined to the notion that these men were honest and meant me\nno ill, I feared it might be otherwise. I nevertheless remembered their\nwords and their advice, and looked forward to an escape to the north, as\na possible means of gaining the liberty{133} for which my heart panted.\nIt was not my enslavement, at the then present time, that most affected\nme; the being a slave _for life_, was the saddest thought. I was too\nyoung to think of running away immediately; besides, I wished to learn\nhow to write, before going, as I might have occasion to write my own\npass. I now not only had the hope of freedom, but a foreshadowing of the\nmeans by which I might, some day, gain that inestimable boon. Meanwhile,\nI resolved to add to my educational attainments the art of writing.\n\nAfter this manner I began to learn to write: I was much in the ship\nyard--Master Hugh’s, and that of Durgan & Bailey--and I observed that\nthe carpenters, after hewing and getting a piece of timber ready for\nuse, wrote on it the initials of the name of that part of the ship for\nwhich it was intended. When, for instance, a piece of timber was ready\nfor the starboard side, it was marked with a capital “S.” A piece for\nthe larboard side was marked “L;” larboard forward, “L. F.;” larboard\naft, was marked “L. A.;” starboard aft, “S. A.;” and starboard forward\n“S. F.” I soon learned these letters, and for what they were placed on\nthe timbers.\n\nMy work was now, to keep fire under the steam box, and to watch the ship\nyard while the carpenters had gone to dinner. This interval gave me a\nfine opportunity for copying the letters named. I soon astonished myself\nwith the ease with which I made the letters; and the thought was soon\npresent, “if I can make four, I can make more.” But having made these\neasily, when I met boys about Bethel church, or any of our play-grounds,\nI entered the lists with them in the art of writing, and would make the\nletters which I had been so fortunate as to learn, and ask them to\n“beat that if they could.” With playmates for my teachers, fences and\npavements for my copy books, and chalk for my pen and ink, I learned\nthe art of writing. I, however, afterward adopted various methods of\nimproving my hand. The most successful, was copying the _italics_\nin Webster’s spelling book, until{134} I could make them all without\nlooking on the book. By this time, my little “Master Tommy” had grown to\nbe a big boy, and had written over a number of copy books, and brought\nthem home. They had been shown to the neighbors, had elicited due\npraise, and were now laid carefully away. Spending my time between the\nship yard and house, I was as often the lone keeper of the latter as\nof the former. When my mistress left me in charge of the house, I had a\ngrand time; I got Master Tommy’s copy books and a pen and ink, and, in\nthe ample spaces between the lines, I wrote other lines, as nearly like\nhis as possible. The process was a tedious one, and I ran the risk\nof getting a flogging for marring the highly prized copy books of the\noldest son. In addition to those opportunities, sleeping, as I did, in\nthe kitchen loft--a room seldom visited by any of the family--I got a\nflour barrel up there, and a chair; and upon the head of that barrel\nI have written (or endeavored to write) copying from the bible and the\nMethodist hymn book, and other books which had accumulated on my hands,\ntill late at night, and when all the family were in bed and asleep. I\nwas supported in my endeavors by renewed advice, and by holy promises\nfrom the good Father Lawson, with whom I continued to meet, and pray,\nand read the scriptures. Although Master Hugh was aware of my going\nthere, I must say, for his credit, that he never executed his threat to\nwhip me, for having thus, innocently, employed-my leisure time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. _The Vicissitudes of Slave Life_\n\nDEATH OF OLD MASTER’S SON RICHARD, SPEEDILY FOLLOWED BY THAT OF OLD\nMASTER--VALUATION AND DIVISION OF ALL THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING THE\nSLAVES--MY PRESENCE REQUIRED AT HILLSBOROUGH TO BE APPRAISED AND\nALLOTTED TO A NEW OWNER--MY SAD PROSPECTS AND GRIEF--PARTING--THE UTTER\nPOWERLESSNESS OF THE SLAVES TO DECIDE THEIR OWN DESTINY--A GENERAL\nDREAD OF MASTER ANDREW--HIS WICKEDNESS AND CRUELTY--MISS LUCRETIA MY NEW\nOWNER--MY RETURN TO BALTIMORE--JOY UNDER THE ROOF OF MASTER HUGH--DEATH\nOF MRS.

Lloyd’s plantation, in _form_ the slave of Master Hugh, I was, in\n_fact_, and in _law_, the slave of my old master, Capt. Anthony. Very\nwell.\n\nIn a very short time after I went to Baltimore, my old master’s youngest\nson, Richard, died; and, in three years and six months after his death,\nmy old master himself died, leaving only his son, Andrew, and his\ndaughter, Lucretia, to share his estate. The{136} old man died while\non a visit to his daughter, in Hillsborough, where Capt. Auld and Mrs.\nLucretia now lived. The former, having given up the command of Col.\nLloyd’s sloop, was now keeping a store in that town.\n\nCut off, thus unexpectedly, Capt. Anthony died intestate; and his\nproperty must now be equally divided between his two children, Andrew\nand Lucretia.\n\nThe valuation and the division of slaves, among contending heirs, is an\nimportant incident in slave life. The character and tendencies of the\nheirs, are generally well understood among the slaves who are to be\ndivided, and all have their aversions and preferences. But, neither\ntheir aversions nor their preferences avail them anything.\n\nOn the death of old master, I was immediately sent for, to be valued\nand divided with the other property. Personally, my concern was, mainly,\nabout my possible removal from the home of Master Hugh, which, after\nthat of my grandmother, was the most endeared to me. But, the whole\nthing, as a feature of slavery, shocked me. It furnished me anew insight\ninto the unnatural power to which I was subjected. My detestation of\nslavery, already great, rose with this new conception of its enormity.\n\nThat was a sad day for me, a sad day for little Tommy, and a sad day\nfor my dear Baltimore mistress and teacher, when I left for the Eastern\nShore, to be valued and divided. We, all three, wept bitterly that day;\nfor we might be parting, and we feared we were parting, forever. No one\ncould tell among which pile of chattels I should be flung. Thus early, I\ngot a foretaste of that painful uncertainty which slavery brings to the\nordinary lot of mortals. Sickness, adversity and death may interfere\nwith the plans and purposes of all; but the slave has the added danger\nof changing homes, changing hands, and of having separations unknown\nto other men. Then, too, there was the intensified degradation of the\nspectacle. What an assemblage! Men and women, young and old, married\nand single; moral and intellectual beings, in open contempt of their\nhumanity, level at a blow with{137} horses, sheep, horned cattle and\nswine! Horses and men--cattle and women--pigs and children--all holding\nthe same rank in the scale of social existence; and all subjected to the\nsame narrow inspection, to ascertain their value in gold and silver--the\nonly standard of worth applied by slaveholders to slaves! How vividly,\nat that moment, did the brutalizing power of slavery flash before me!\nPersonality swallowed up in the sordid idea of property! Manhood lost in\nchattelhood!\n\nAfter the valuation, then came the division. This was an hour of high\nexcitement and distressing anxiety. Our destiny was now to be _fixed for\nlife_, and we had no more voice in the decision of the question, than\nthe oxen and cows that stood chewing at the haymow. One word from the\nappraisers, against all preferences or prayers, was enough to sunder all\nthe ties of friendship and affection, and even to separate husbands and\nwives, parents and children. We were all appalled before that power,\nwhich, to human seeming, could bless or blast us in a moment. Added to\nthe dread of separation, most painful to the majority of the slaves,\nwe all had a decided horror of the thought of falling into the hands of\nMaster Andrew. He was distinguished for cruelty and intemperance.\n\nSlaves generally dread to fall into the hands of drunken owners. Master\nAndrew was almost a confirmed sot, and had already, by his reckless\nmismanagement and profligate dissipation, wasted a large portion of old\nmaster’s property. To fall into his hands, was, therefore, considered\nmerely as the first step toward being sold away to the far south. He\nwould spend his fortune in a few years, and his farms and slaves would\nbe sold, we thought, at public outcry; and we should be hurried away\nto the cotton fields, and rice swamps, of the sunny south. This was the\ncause of deep consternation.\n\nThe people of the north, and free people generally, I think, have less\nattachment to the places where they are born and brought up, than have\nthe slaves. Their freedom to go and come,{138} to be here and there,\nas they list, prevents any extravagant attachment to any one particular\nplace, in their case. On the other hand, the slave is a fixture; he has\nno choice, no goal, no destination; but is pegged down to a single spot,\nand must take root here, or nowhere. The idea of removal elsewhere,\ncomes, generally, in the shape of a threat, and in punishment of crime.\nIt is, therefore, attended with fear and dread. A slave seldom thinks\nof bettering his condition by being sold, and hence he looks upon\nseparation from his native place, with none of the enthusiasm which\nanimates the bosoms of young freemen, when they contemplate a life in\nthe far west, or in some distant country where they intend to rise to\nwealth and distinction. Nor can those from whom they separate, give them\nup with that cheerfulness with which friends and relations yield each\nother up, when they feel that it is for the good of the departing\none that he is removed from his native place. Then, too, there is\ncorrespondence, and there is, at least, the hope of reunion, because\nreunion is _possible_. But, with the slave, all these mitigating\ncircumstances are wanting. There is no improvement in his condition\n_probable_,--no correspondence _possible_,--no reunion attainable. His\ngoing out into the world, is like a living man going into the tomb, who,\nwith open eyes, sees himself buried out of sight and hearing of wife,\nchildren and friends of kindred tie.\n\nIn contemplating the likelihoods and possibilities of our circumstances,\nI probably suffered more than most of my fellow servants. I had known\nwhat it was to experience kind, and even tender treatment; they had\nknown nothing of the sort. Life, to them, had been rough and thorny, as\nwell as dark. They had--most of them--lived on my old master’s farm in\nTuckahoe, and had felt the reign of Mr. Plummer’s rule. The overseer had\nwritten his character on the living parchment of most of their backs,\nand left them callous; my back (thanks to my early removal from the\nplantation to Baltimore) was yet tender. I had left a kind mistress{139}\nat Baltimore, who was almost a mother to me. She was in tears when we\nparted, and the probabilities of ever seeing her again, trembling in the\nbalance as they did, could not be viewed without alarm and agony. The\nthought of leaving that kind mistress forever, and, worse still, of\nbeing the slave of Andrew Anthony--a man who, but a few days before the\ndivision of the property, had, in my presence, seized my brother Perry\nby the throat, dashed him on the ground, and with the heel of his\nboot stamped him on the head, until the blood gushed from his nose and\nears--was terrible! This fiendish proceeding had no better apology than\nthe fact, that Perry had gone to play, when Master Andrew wanted him\nfor some trifling service. This cruelty, too, was of a piece with his\ngeneral character. After inflicting his heavy blows on my brother, on\nobserving me looking at him with intense astonishment, he said, “_That_\nis the way I will serve you, one of these days;” meaning, no doubt,\nwhen I should come into his possession. This threat, the reader may well\nsuppose, was not very tranquilizing to my feelings. I could see that he\nreally thirsted to get hold of me. But I was there only for a few days.\nI had not received any orders, and had violated none, and there was,\ntherefore, no excuse for flogging me.\n\nAt last, the anxiety and suspense were ended; and they ended, thanks to\na kind Providence, in accordance with my wishes. I fell to the portion\nof Mrs. Lucretia--the dear lady who bound up my head, when the savage\nAunt Katy was adding to my sufferings her bitterest maledictions.\n\nCapt. Thomas Auld and Mrs. Lucretia at once decided on my return\nto Baltimore. They knew how sincerely and warmly Mrs. Hugh Auld was\nattached to me, and how delighted Mr. Hugh’s son would be to have\nme back; and, withal, having no immediate use for one so young, they\nwillingly let me off to Baltimore.\n\nI need not stop here to narrate my joy on returning to Baltimore, nor\nthat of little Tommy; nor the tearful joy of his mother;{140} nor the\nevident saticfaction(sic) of Master Hugh. I was just one month absent\nfrom Baltimore, before the matter was decided; and the time really\nseemed full six months.\n\nOne trouble over, and on comes another. The slave’s life is full of\nuncertainty. I had returned to Baltimore but a short time, when the\ntidings reached me, that my friend, Mrs. Lucretia, who was only second\nin my regard to Mrs. Hugh Auld, was dead, leaving her husband and only\none child--a daughter, named Amanda.\n\nShortly after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, strange to say, Master Andrew\ndied, leaving his wife and one child. Thus, the whole family of Anthonys\nwas swept away; only two children remained. All this happened within\nfive years of my leaving Col. Lloyd’s.\n\nNo alteration took place in the condition of the slaves, in consequence\nof these deaths, yet I could not help feeling less secure, after the\ndeath of my friend, Mrs. Lucretia, than I had done during her life.\nWhile she lived, I felt that I had a strong friend to plead for me in\nany emergency. Ten years ago, while speaking of the state of things in\nour family, after the events just named, I used this language:\n\nNow all the property of my old master, slaves included, was in the hands\nof strangers--strangers who had nothing to do in accumulating it. Not\na slave was left free. All remained slaves, from youngest to oldest. If\nany one thing in my experience, more than another, served to deepen my\nconviction of the infernal character of slavery, and to fill me with\nunutterable loathing of slaveholders, it was their base ingratitude to\nmy poor old grandmother. She had served my old master faithfully from\nyouth to old age. She had been the source of all his wealth; she had\npeopled his plantation with slaves; she had become a great-grandmother\nin his service. She had rocked him in infancy, attended him in\nchildhood, served him through life, and at his death wiped from his\nicy brow the cold death-sweat, and closed his eyes forever. She was\nnevertheless left a slave--a slave for life--a slave in the hands of\nstrangers; and in their hands she saw her children, her grandchildren,\nand her great-grandchildren, divided, like so many sheep, without being\ngratified with the small privilege of a single word, as to their or\nher own destiny. And, to cap the climax of their base ingratitude\nand fiendish barbarity, my grandmother, who was now very old, having\noutlived my old master and all his children, having seen the beginning\nand end of all of them, and her present owners finding she{141} was of\nbut little value, her frame already racked with the pains of old age,\nand complete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs,\nthey took her to the woods, built her a little hut, put up a little\nmud-chimney, and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting\nherself there in perfect loneliness; thus virtually turning her out to\ndie! If my poor old grandmother now lives, she lives to suffer in utter\nloneliness; she lives to remember and mourn over the loss of children,\nthe loss of grandchildren, and the loss of great-grandchildren. They\nare, in the language of the slave’s poet, Whittier--\n\n                _Gone, gone, sold and gone,\n                To the rice swamp dank and lone,\n                Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings,\n                Where the noisome insect stings,\n                Where the fever-demon strews\n                Poison with the falling dews,\n                Where the sickly sunbeams glare\n                Through the hot and misty air:--\n                        Gone, gone, sold and gone\n                        To the rice swamp dank and lone,\n                        From Virginia hills and waters--\n                        Woe is me, my stolen daughters_!\n\n\nThe hearth is desolate. The children, the unconscious children, who once\nsang and danced in her presence, are gone. She gropes her way, in the\ndarkness of age, for a drink of water. Instead of the voices of her\nchildren, she hears by day the moans of the dove, and by night the\nscreams of the hideous owl. All is gloom. The grave is at the door. And\nnow, when weighed down by the pains and aches of old age, when the head\ninclines to the feet, when the beginning and ending of human existence\nmeet, and helpless infancy and painful old age combine together--at\nthis time, this most needful time, the time for the exercise of that\ntenderness and affection which children only can exercise toward a\ndeclining parent--my poor old grandmother, the devoted mother of twelve\nchildren, is left all alone, in yonder little hut, before a few dim\nembers.\n\nTwo years after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, Master Thomas married his\nsecond wife. Her name was Rowena Hamilton, the eldest daughter of Mr.\nWilliam Hamilton, a rich slaveholder on the Eastern Shore of Maryland,\nwho lived about five miles from St. Michael’s, the then place of my\nmaster’s residence.\n\nNot long after his marriage, Master Thomas had a misunderstanding with\nMaster Hugh, and, as a means of punishing his brother, he ordered him to\nsend me home.{142}\n\nAs the ground of misunderstanding will serve to illustrate the character\nof southern chivalry, and humanity, I will relate it.\n\nAmong the children of my Aunt Milly, was a daughter, named Henny. When\nquite a child, Henny had fallen into the fire, and burnt her hands so\nbad that they were of very little use to her. Her fingers were drawn\nalmost into the palms of her hands. She could make out to do something,\nbut she was considered hardly worth the having--of little more value\nthan a horse with a broken leg. This unprofitable piece of human\nproperty, ill shapen, and disfigured, Capt. Auld sent off to Baltimore,\nmaking his brother Hugh welcome to her services.\n\nAfter giving poor Henny a fair trial, Master Hugh and his wife came to\nthe conclusion, that they had no use for the crippled servant, and\nthey sent her back to Master Thomas. Thus, the latter took as an act\nof ingratitude, on the part of his brother; and, as a mark of his\ndispleasure, he required him to send me immediately to St. Michael’s,\nsaying, if he cannot keep _“Hen,”_ he shall not have _“Fred.”_\n\nHere was another shock to my nerves, another breaking up of my plans,\nand another severance of my religious and social alliances. I was now a\nbig boy. I had become quite useful to several young colored men, who\nhad made me their teacher. I had taught some of them to read, and was\naccustomed to spend many of my leisure hours with them. Our attachment\nwas strong, and I greatly dreaded the separation. But regrets,\nespecially in a slave, are unavailing. I was only a slave; my wishes\nwere nothing, and my happiness was the sport of my masters.\n\nMy regrets at now leaving Baltimore, were not for the same reasons as\nwhen I before left that city, to be valued and handed over to my proper\nowner. My home was not now the pleasant place it had formerly been. A\nchange had taken place, both in Master Hugh, and in his once pious and\naffectionate wife. The influence of brandy and bad company on him, and\nthe influence of slavery and social isolation upon her, had wrought\ndisastrously upon the{143} characters of both. Thomas was no longer\n“little Tommy,” but was a big boy, and had learned to assume the airs\nof his class toward me. My condition, therefore, in the house of Master\nHugh, was not, by any means, so comfortable as in former years. My\nattachments were now outside of our family. They were felt to those to\nwhom I _imparted_ instruction, and to those little white boys from whom\nI _received_ instruction. There, too, was my dear old father, the pious\nLawson, who was, in christian graces, the very counterpart of “Uncle”\n Tom. The resemblance is so perfect, that he might have been the original\nof Mrs. Stowe’s christian hero. The thought of leaving these dear\nfriends, greatly troubled me, for I was going without the hope of ever\nreturning to Baltimore again; the feud between Master Hugh and his\nbrother being bitter and irreconcilable, or, at least, supposed to be\nso.\n\nIn addition to thoughts of friends from whom I was parting, as I\nsupposed, _forever_, I had the grief of neglected chances of escape to\nbrood over. I had put off running away, until now I was to be placed\nwhere the opportunities for escaping were much fewer than in a large\ncity like Baltimore.\n\nOn my way from Baltimore to St. Michael’s, down the Chesapeake bay, our\nsloop--the “Amanda”--was passed by the steamers plying between that city\nand Philadelphia, and I watched the course of those steamers, and, while\ngoing to St. Michael’s, I formed a plan to escape from slavery; of which\nplan, and matters connected therewith the kind reader shall learn more\nhereafter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. _Experience in St. Michael’s_\n\nTHE VILLAGE--ITS INHABITANTS--THEIR OCCUPATION AND LOW PROPENSITIES\nCAPTAN(sic) THOMAS AULD--HIS CHARACTER--HIS SECOND WIFE, ROWENA--WELL\nMATCHED--SUFFERINGS FROM HUNGER--OBLIGED TO TAKE FOOD--MODE OF ARGUMENT\nIN VINDICATION THEREOF--NO MORAL CODE OF FREE SOCIETY CAN APPLY TO\nSLAVE SOCIETY--SOUTHERN CAMP MEETING--WHAT MASTER THOMAS DID\nTHERE--HOPES--SUSPICIONS ABOUT HIS CONVERSION--THE RESULT--FAITH AND\nWORKS ENTIRELY AT VARIANCE--HIS RISE AND PROGRESS IN THE CHURCH--POOR\nCOUSIN “HENNY”--HIS TREATMENT OF HER--THE METHODIST PREACHERS--THEIR\nUTTER DISREGARD OF US--ONE EXCELLENT EXCEPTION--REV.

There were a few\ncomfortable dwellings in it, but the place, as a whole, wore a dull,\nslovenly, enterprise-forsaken aspect. The mass of the buildings were\nwood; they had never enjoyed the artificial adornment of paint, and\ntime and storms had worn off the bright color of the wood, leaving them\nalmost as black as buildings charred by a conflagration.\n\nSt. Michael’s had, in former years, (previous to 1833, for that was the\nyear I went to reside there,) enjoyed some reputation as a ship building\ncommunity, but that business had almost entirely given place to oyster\nfishing, for the Baltimore and Philadelphia markets--a course of life\nhighly unfavorable to morals, industry, and manners. Miles river was\nbroad, and its oyster fishing{145} grounds were extensive; and the\nfishermen were out, often, all day, and a part of the night, during\nautumn, winter and spring. This exposure was an excuse for carrying\nwith them, in considerable quanties(sic), spirituous liquors, the then\nsupposed best antidote for cold. Each canoe was supplied with its jug\nof rum; and tippling, among this class of the citizens of St. Michael’s,\nbecame general. This drinking habit, in an ignorant population,\nfostered coarseness, vulgarity and an indolent disregard for the social\nimprovement of the place, so that it was admitted, by the few sober,\nthinking people who remained there, that St. Michael’s had become a very\n_unsaintly_, as well as unsightly place, before I went there to reside.\n\nI left Baltimore for St. Michael’s in the month of March, 1833. I\nknow the year, because it was the one succeeding the first cholera in\nBaltimore, and was the year, also, of that strange phenomenon, when the\nheavens seemed about to part with its starry train. I witnessed this\ngorgeous spectacle, and was awe-struck. The air seemed filled with\nbright, descending messengers from the sky. It was about daybreak when I\nsaw this sublime scene. I was not without the suggestion, at the moment,\nthat it might be the harbinger of the coming of the Son of Man; and,\nin my then state of mind, I was prepared to hail Him as my friend and\ndeliverer. I had read, that the “stars shall fall from heaven”; and\nthey were now falling. I was suffering much in my mind. It did seem that\nevery time the young tendrils of my affection became attached, they were\nrudely broken by some unnatural outside power; and I was beginning to\nlook away to heaven for the rest denied me on earth.\n\nBut, to my story. It was now more than seven years since I had lived\nwith Master Thomas Auld, in the family of my old master, on Col. Lloyd’s\nplantation. We were almost entire strangers to each other; for, when I\nknew him at the house of my old master, it was not as a _master_, but\nsimply as “Captain Auld,” who had married old master’s daughter. All my\nlessons concerning his{146} temper and disposition, and the best methods\nof pleasing him, were yet to be learnt. Slaveholders, however, are not\nvery ceremonious in approaching a slave; and my ignorance of the new\nmaterial in shape of a master was but transient. Nor was my mistress\nlong in making known her animus. She was not a “Miss Lucretia,” traces\nof whom I yet remembered, and the more especially, as I saw them\nshining in the face of little Amanda, her daughter, now living under a\nstep-mother’s government. I had not forgotten the soft hand, guided by a\ntender heart, that bound up with healing balsam the gash made in my head\nby Ike, the son of Abel. Thomas and Rowena, I found to be a well-matched\npair. _He_ was stingy, and _she_ was cruel; and--what was quite natural\nin such cases--she possessed the ability to make him as cruel as\nherself, while she could easily descend to the level of his meanness.\nIn the house of Master Thomas, I was made--for the first time in seven\nyears to feel the pinchings of hunger, and this was not very easy to\nbear.\n\nFor, in all the changes of Master Hugh’s family, there was no change in\nthe bountifulness with which they supplied me with food. Not to give a\nslave enough to eat, is meanness intensified, and it is so recognized\namong slaveholders generally, in Maryland. The rule is, no matter how\ncoarse the food, only let there be enough of it. This is the theory,\nand--in the part of Maryland I came from--the general practice accords\nwith this theory. Lloyd’s plantation was an exception, as was, also, the\nhouse of Master Thomas Auld.\n\nAll know the lightness of Indian corn-meal, as an article of food, and\ncan easily judge from the following facts whether the statements I have\nmade of the stinginess of Master Thomas, are borne out. There were four\nslaves of us in the kitchen, and four whites in the great house Thomas\nAuld, Mrs. Auld, Hadaway Auld (brother of Thomas Auld) and little\nAmanda. The names of the slaves in the kitchen, were Eliza, my sister;\nPriscilla, my aunt; Henny, my cousin; and myself. There were eight\npersons{147} in the family. There was, each week, one half bushel of\ncorn-meal brought from the mill; and in the kitchen, corn-meal was\nalmost our exclusive food, for very little else was allowed us. Out of\nthis bushel of corn-meal, the family in the great house had a small loaf\nevery morning; thus leaving us, in the kitchen, with not quite a half a\npeck per week, apiece. This allowance was less than half the allowance\nof food on Lloyd’s plantation. It was not enough to subsist upon; and\nwe were, therefore, reduced to the wretched necessity of living at the\nexpense of our neighbors. We were compelled either to beg, or to steal,\nand we did both. I frankly confess, that while I hated everything like\nstealing, _as such_, I nevertheless did not hesitate to take food, when\nI was hungry, wherever I could find it. Nor was this practice the mere\nresult of an unreasoning instinct; it was, in my case, the result of a\nclear apprehension of the claims of morality. I weighed and considered\nthe matter closely, before I ventured to satisfy my hunger by such\nmeans. Considering that my labor and person were the property of Master\nThomas, and that I was by him deprived of the necessaries of life\nnecessaries obtained by my own labor--it was easy to deduce the right to\nsupply myself with what was my own. It was simply appropriating what was\nmy own to the use of my master, since the health and strength derived\nfrom such food were exerted in _his_ service. To be sure, this was\nstealing, according to the law and gospel I heard from St. Michael’s\npulpit; but I had already begun to attach less importance to what\ndropped from that quarter, on that point, while, as yet, I retained\nmy reverence for religion. It was not always convenient to steal from\nmaster, and the same reason why I might, innocently, steal from him,\ndid not seem to justify me in stealing from others. In the case of my\nmaster, it was only a question of _removal_--the taking his meat out of\none tub, and putting it into another; the ownership of the meat was not\naffected by the transaction. At first, he owned it in the _tub_, and\nlast, he owned it in _me_. His meat house was not always open. There was\na strict watch kept on that{148} point, and the key was on a large bunch\nin Rowena’s pocket. A great many times have we, poor creatures, been\nseverely pinched with hunger, when meat and bread have been moulding\nunder the lock, while the key was in the pocket of our mistress. This\nhad been so when she _knew_ we were nearly half starved; and yet, that\nmistress, with saintly air, would kneel with her husband, and pray each\nmorning that a merciful God would bless them in basket and in store, and\nsave them, at last, in his kingdom. But I proceed with the argument.\n\nIt was necessary that right to steal from _others_ should be\nestablished; and this could only rest upon a wider range of\ngeneralization than that which supposed the right to steal from my\nmaster.\n\nIt was sometime before I arrived at this clear right. The reader will\nget some idea of my train of reasoning, by a brief statement of the\ncase. “I am,” thought I, “not only the slave of Thomas, but I am the\nslave of society at large. Society at large has bound itself, in form\nand in fact, to assist Master Thomas in robbing me of my rightful\nliberty, and of the just reward of my labor; therefore, whatever\nrights I have against Master Thomas, I have, equally, against those\nconfederated with him in robbing me of liberty. As society has marked\nme out as privileged plunder, on the principle of self-preservation I\nam justified in plundering in turn. Since each slave belongs to all; all\nmust, therefore, belong to each.”\n\nI shall here make a profession of faith which may shock some, offend\nothers, and be dissented from by all. It is this: Within the bounds of\nhis just earnings, I hold that the slave is fully justified in helping\nhimself to the _gold and silver, and the best apparel of his master, or\nthat of any other slaveholder; and that such taking is not stealing in\nany just sense of that word_.\n\nThe morality of _free_ society can have no application to _slave_\nsociety. Slaveholders have made it almost impossible for the slave to\ncommit any crime, known either to the laws of God or to the laws of man.\nIf he steals, he takes his own; if he kills his master,{149} he\nimitates only the heroes of the revolution. Slaveholders I hold to be\nindividually and collectively responsible for all the evils which grow\nout of the horrid relation, and I believe they will be so held at the\njudgment, in the sight of a just God. Make a man a slave, and you rob\nhim of moral responsibility. Freedom of choice is the essence of all\naccountability. But my kind readers are, probably, less concerned about\nmy opinions, than about that which more nearly touches my personal\nexperience; albeit, my opinions have, in some sort, been formed by that\nexperience.\n\nBad as slaveholders are, I have seldom met with one so entirely\ndestitute of every element of character capable of inspiring respect, as\nwas my present master, Capt. Thomas Auld.\n\nWhen I lived with him, I thought him incapable of a noble action. The\nleading trait in his character was intense selfishness. I think he was\nfully aware of this fact himself, and often tried to conceal it. Capt.\nAuld was not a _born_ slaveholder--not a birthright member of the\nslaveholding oligarchy. He was only a slaveholder by _marriage-right;_\nand, of all slaveholders, these latter are, _by far_, the most exacting.\nThere was in him all the love of domination, the pride of mastery,\nand the swagger of authority, but his rule lacked the vital element\nof consistency. He could be cruel; but his methods of showing it were\ncowardly, and evinced his meanness rather than his spirit. His commands\nwere strong, his enforcement weak.\n\nSlaves are not insensible to the whole-souled characteristics of a\ngenerous, dashing slaveholder, who is fearless of consequences; and\nthey prefer a master of this bold and daring kind--even with the risk\nof being shot down for impudence to the fretful, little soul, who never\nuses the lash but at the suggestion of a love of gain.\n\nSlaves, too, readily distinguish between the birthright bearing of\nthe original slaveholder and the assumed attitudes of the accidental\nslaveholder; and while they cannot respect either, they certainly\ndespise the latter more than the former.{150}\n\nThe luxury of having slaves wait upon him was something new to Master\nThomas; and for it he was wholly unprepared. He was a slaveholder,\nwithout the ability to hold or manage his slaves. We seldom called him\n“master,” but generally addressed him by his “bay craft” title--“_Capt.\nAuld_.” It is easy to see that such conduct might do much to make him\nappear awkward, and, consequently, fretful. His wife was especially\nsolicitous to have us call her husband “master.” Is your _master_ at the\nstore?”--“Where is your _master_?”--“Go and tell your _master”_--“I will\nmake your _master_ acquainted with your conduct”--she would say; but we\nwere inapt scholars. Especially were I and my sister Eliza inapt in this\nparticular. Aunt Priscilla was less stubborn and defiant in her spirit\nthan Eliza and myself; and, I think, her road was less rough than ours.\n\nIn the month of August, 1833, when I had almost become desperate under\nthe treatment of Master Thomas, and when I entertained more strongly\nthan ever the oft-repeated determination to run away, a circumstance\noccurred which seemed to promise brighter and better days for us all.\nAt a Methodist camp-meeting, held in the Bay Side (a famous place for\ncampmeetings) about eight miles from St. Michael’s, Master Thomas\ncame out with a profession of religion. He had long been an object\nof interest to the church, and to the ministers, as I had seen by the\nrepeated visits and lengthy exhortations of the latter. He was a fish\nquite worth catching, for he had money and standing. In the community\nof St. Michael’s he was equal to the best citizen. He was strictly\ntemperate; _perhaps_, from principle, but most likely, from interest.\nThere was very little to do for him, to give him the appearance of\npiety, and to make him a pillar in the church. Well, the camp-meeting\ncontinued a week; people gathered from all parts of the county, and\ntwo steamboat loads came from Baltimore. The ground was happily chosen;\nseats were arranged; a stand erected; a rude altar fenced in, fronting\nthe preachers’ stand, with straw in it for the accommodation of{151}\nmourners. This latter would hold at least one hundred persons. In front,\nand on the sides of the preachers’ stand, and outside the long rows of\nseats, rose the first class of stately tents, each vieing with the\nother in strength, neatness, and capacity for accommodating its inmates.\nBehind this first circle of tents was another, less imposing, which\nreached round the camp-ground to the speakers’ stand. Outside this\nsecond class of tents were covered wagons, ox carts, and vehicles of\nevery shape and size. These served as tents to their owners. Outside of\nthese, huge fires were burning, in all directions, where roasting, and\nboiling, and frying, were going on, for the benefit of those who were\nattending to their own spiritual welfare within the circle. _Behind_\nthe preachers’ stand, a narrow space was marked out for the use of the\ncolored people. There were no seats provided for this class of persons;\nthe preachers addressed them, _“over the left,”_ if they addressed them\nat all. After the preaching was over, at every service, an invitation\nwas given to mourners to come into the pen; and, in some cases,\nministers went out to persuade men and women to come in. By one of these\nministers, Master Thomas Auld was persuaded to go inside the pen. I\nwas deeply interested in that matter, and followed; and, though colored\npeople were not allowed either in the pen or in front of the preachers’\nstand, I ventured to take my stand at a sort of half-way place between\nthe blacks and whites, where I could distinctly see the movements of\nmourners, and especially the progress of Master Thomas.\n\n“If he has got religion,” thought I, “he will emancipate his slaves; and\nif he should not do so much as this, he will, at any rate, behave toward\nus more kindly, and feed us more generously than he has heretofore\ndone.” Appealing to my own religious experience, and judging my master\nby what was true in my own case, I could not regard him as soundly\nconverted, unless some such good results followed his profession of\nreligion.\n\nBut in my expectations I was doubly disappointed; Master Thomas was\n_Master Thomas_ still. The fruits of his righteousness{152} were to\nshow themselves in no such way as I had anticipated. His conversion\nwas not to change his relation toward men--at any rate not toward BLACK\nmen--but toward God. My faith, I confess, was not great. There was\nsomething in his appearance that, in my mind, cast a doubt over his\nconversion. Standing where I did, I could see his every movement. I\nwatched narrowly while he remained in the little pen; and although I saw\nthat his face was extremely red, and his hair disheveled, and though\nI heard him groan, and saw a stray tear halting on his cheek, as if\ninquiring “which way shall I go?”--I could not wholly confide in the\ngenuineness of his conversion. The hesitating behavior of that tear-drop\nand its loneliness, distressed me, and cast a doubt upon the whole\ntransaction, of which it was a part. But people said, _“Capt. Auld had\ncome through,”_ and it was for me to hope for the best. I was bound\nto do this, in charity, for I, too, was religious, and had been in the\nchurch full three years, although now I was not more than sixteen years\nold. Slaveholders may, sometimes, have confidence in the piety of some\nof their slaves; but the slaves seldom have confidence in the piety of\ntheir masters. _“He cant go to heaven with our blood in his skirts_,”\n is a settled point in the creed of every slave; rising superior to all\nteaching to the contrary, and standing forever as a fixed fact. The\nhighest evidence the slaveholder can give the slave of his acceptance\nwith God, is the emancipation of his slaves. This is proof that he is\nwilling to give up all to God, and for the sake of God. Not to do this,\nwas, in my estimation, and in the opinion of all the slaves, an evidence\nof half-heartedness, and wholly inconsistent with the idea of genuine\nconversion. I had read, also, somewhere in the Methodist Discipline, the\nfollowing question and answer:\n\n“_Question_. What shall be done for the extirpation of slavery?\n\n“_Answer_. We declare that we are much as ever convinced of the great\nevil of slavery; therefore, no slaveholder shall be eligible to any\nofficial station in our church.”\n\n\nThese words sounded in my ears for a long time, and{153} encouraged me\nto hope. But, as I have before said, I was doomed to disappointment.\nMaster Thomas seemed to be aware of my hopes and expectations concerning\nhim. I have thought, before now, that he looked at me in answer to my\nglances, as much as to say, “I will teach you, young man, that, though I\nhave parted with my sins, I have not parted with my sense. I shall hold\nmy slaves, and go to heaven too.”\n\nPossibly, to convince us that we must not presume _too much_ upon his\nrecent conversion, he became rather more rigid and stringent in his\nexactions. There always was a scarcity of good nature about the man; but\nnow his whole countenance was _soured_ over with the seemings of piety.\nHis religion, therefore, neither made him emancipate his slaves, nor\ncaused him to treat them with greater humanity. If religion had any\neffect on his character at all, it made him more cruel and hateful in\nall his ways. The natural wickedness of his heart had not been removed,\nbut only reinforced, by the profession of religion. Do I judge him\nharshly? God forbid. Facts _are_ facts. Capt. Auld made the greatest\nprofession of piety. His house was, literally, a house of prayer. In the\nmorning, and in the evening, loud prayers and hymns were heard there, in\nwhich both himself and his wife joined; yet, _no more meal_ was brought\nfrom the mill, _no more attention_ was paid to the moral welfare of the\nkitchen; and nothing was done to make us feel that the heart of Master\nThomas was one whit better than it was before he went into the little\npen, opposite to the preachers’ stand, on the camp ground.\n\nOur hopes (founded on the discipline) soon vanished; for the authorities\nlet him into the church _at once_, and before he was out of his term\nof _probation_, I heard of his leading class! He distinguished himself\ngreatly among the brethren, and was soon an exhorter. His progress was\nalmost as rapid as the growth of the fabled vine of Jack’s bean. No man\nwas more active than he, in revivals. He would go many miles to assist\nin carrying them on, and in getting outsiders interested in religion.\nHis house being{154} one of the holiest, if not the happiest in St.\nMichael’s, became the “preachers’ home.” These preachers evidently liked\nto share Master Thomas’s hospitality; for while he _starved us_,\nhe _stuffed_ them. Three or four of these ambassadors of the\ngospel--according to slavery--have been there at a time; all living on\nthe fat of the land, while we, in the kitchen, were nearly starving. Not\noften did we get a smile of recognition from these holy men. They seemed\nalmost as unconcerned about our getting to heaven, as they were about\nour getting out of slavery. To this general charge there was one\nexception--the Rev. GEORGE COOKMAN. Unlike Rev. Messrs. Storks, Ewry,\nHickey, Humphrey and Cooper (all whom were on the St. Michael’s circuit)\nhe kindly took an interest in our temporal and spiritual welfare. Our\nsouls and our bodies were all alike sacred in his sight; and he really\nhad a good deal of genuine anti-slavery feeling mingled with his\ncolonization ideas. There was not a slave in our neighborhood that did\nnot love, and almost venerate, Mr. Cookman. It was pretty generally\nbelieved that he had been chiefly instrumental in bringing one of the\nlargest slaveholders--Mr. Samuel Harrison--in that neighborhood, to\nemancipate all his slaves, and, indeed, the general impression was, that\nMr. Cookman had labored faithfully with slaveholders, whenever he met\nthem, to induce them to emancipate their bondmen, and that he did this\nas a religious duty. When this good man was at our house, we were all\nsure to be called in to prayers in the morning; and he was not slow in\nmaking inquiries as to the state of our minds, nor in giving us a word\nof exhortation and of encouragement. Great was the sorrow of all the\nslaves, when this faithful preacher of the gospel was removed from the\nTalbot county circuit. He was an eloquent preacher, and possessed what\nfew ministers, south of Mason Dixon’s line, possess, or _dare_ to show,\nviz: a warm and philanthropic heart. The Mr. Cookman, of whom I speak,\nwas an Englishman by birth, and perished while on his way to England, on\nboard the ill-fated “President”. Could the thousands of slaves{155} in\nMaryland know the fate of the good man, to whose words of comfort they\nwere so largely indebted, they would thank me for dropping a tear on\nthis page, in memory of their favorite preacher, friend and benefactor.\n\nBut, let me return to Master Thomas, and to my experience, after his\nconversion. In Baltimore, I could, occasionally, get into a Sabbath\nschool, among the free children, and receive lessons, with the rest;\nbut, having already learned both to read and to write, I was more of\na teacher than a pupil, even there. When, however, I went back to the\nEastern Shore, and was at the house of Master Thomas, I was neither\nallowed to teach, nor to be taught. The whole community--with but\na single exception, among the whites--frowned upon everything like\nimparting instruction either to slaves or to free colored persons. That\nsingle exception, a pious young man, named Wilson, asked me, one day, if\nI would like to assist him in teaching a little Sabbath school, at the\nhouse of a free colored man in St. Michael’s, named James Mitchell. The\nidea was to me a delightful one, and I told him I would gladly devote as\nmuch of my Sabbath as I could command, to that most laudable work.\nMr. Wilson soon mustered up a dozen old spelling books, and a few\ntestaments; and we commenced operations, with some twenty scholars, in\nour Sunday school. Here, thought I, is something worth living for; here\nis an excellent chance for usefulness; and I shall soon have a company\nof young friends, lovers of knowledge, like some of my Baltimore\nfriends, from whom I now felt parted forever.\n\nOur first Sabbath passed delightfully, and I spent the week after\nvery joyously. I could not go to Baltimore, but I could make a little\nBaltimore here. At our second meeting, I learned that there was some\nobjection to the existence of the Sabbath school; and, sure enough, we\nhad scarcely got at work--_good work_, simply teaching a few colored\nchildren how to read the gospel of the Son of God--when in rushed a\nmob, headed by Mr. Wright Fairbanks and Mr. Garrison West--two\nclass-leaders{156} --and Master Thomas; who, armed with sticks and\nother missiles, drove us off, and commanded us never to meet for such\na purpose again. One of this pious crew told me, that as for my part, I\nwanted to be another Nat Turner; and if I did not look out, I should\nget as many balls into me, as Nat did into him. Thus ended the infant\nSabbath school, in the town of St. Michael’s. The reader will not be\nsurprised when I say, that the breaking up of my Sabbath school,\nby these class-leaders, and professedly holy men, did not serve to\nstrengthen my religious convictions. The cloud over my St. Michael’s\nhome grew heavier and blacker than ever.\n\nIt was not merely the agency of Master Thomas, in breaking up and\ndestroying my Sabbath school, that shook my confidence in the power of\nsouthern religion to make men wiser or better; but I saw in him all the\ncruelty and meanness, _after_ his conversion, which he had exhibited\nbefore he made a profession of religion. His cruelty and meanness were\nespecially displayed in his treatment of my unfortunate cousin, Henny,\nwhose lameness made her a burden to him. I have no extraordinary\npersonal hard usage toward myself to complain of, against him, but I\nhave seen him tie up the lame and maimed woman, and whip her in a manner\nmost brutal, and shocking; and then, with blood-chilling blasphemy,\nhe would quote the passage of scripture, “That servant which knew his\nlord’s will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his\nwill, shall be beaten with many stripes.” Master would keep this\nlacerated woman tied up by her wrists, to a bolt in the joist, three,\nfour and five hours at a time. He would tie her up early in the morning,\nwhip her with a cowskin before breakfast; leave her tied up; go to his\nstore, and, returning to his dinner, repeat the castigation; laying on\nthe rugged lash, on flesh already made raw by repeated blows. He seemed\ndesirous to get the poor girl out of existence, or, at any rate, off his\nhands. In proof of this, he afterwards gave her away to his sister Sarah\n(Mrs. Cline) but, as in the case of Master{157} Hugh, Henny was soon\nreturned on his hands. Finally, upon a pretense that he could do nothing\nwith her (I use his own words) he “set her adrift, to take care of\nherself.” Here was a recently converted man, holding, with tight grasp,\nthe well-framed, and able bodied slaves left him by old master--the\npersons, who, in freedom, could have taken care of themselves; yet,\nturning loose the only cripple among them, virtually to starve and die.\n\nNo doubt, had Master Thomas been asked, by some pious northern brother,\n_why_ he continued to sustain the relation of a slaveholder, to those\nwhom he retained, his answer would have been precisely the same as many\nother religious slaveholders have returned to that inquiry, viz: “I hold\nmy slaves for their own good.”\n\nBad as my condition was when I lived with Master Thomas, I was soon\nto experience a life far more goading and bitter. The many differences\nspringing up between myself and Master Thomas, owing to the clear\nperception I had of his character, and the boldness with which I\ndefended myself against his capricious complaints, led him to declare\nthat I was unsuited to his wants; that my city life had affected me\nperniciously; that, in fact, it had almost ruined me for every good\npurpose, and had fitted me for everything that was bad. One of my\ngreatest faults, or offenses, was that of letting his horse get away,\nand go down to the farm belonging to his father-in-law. The animal had a\nliking for that farm, with which I fully sympathized. Whenever I let it\nout, it would go dashing down the road to Mr. Hamilton’s, as if going\non a grand frolic. My horse gone, of course I must go after it. The\nexplanation of our mutual attachment to the place is the same; the\nhorse found there good pasturage, and I found there plenty of bread. Mr.\nHamilton had his faults, but starving his slaves was not among them. He\ngave food, in abundance, and that, too, of an excellent quality. In\nMr. Hamilton’s cook--Aunt Mary--I found a most generous and considerate\nfriend. She never allowed me to go there without giving me bread\nenough{158} to make good the deficiencies of a day or two. Master Thomas\nat last resolved to endure my behavior no longer; he could neither keep\nme, nor his horse, we liked so well to be at his father-in-law’s farm. I\nhad now lived with him nearly nine months, and he had given me a number\nof severe whippings, without any visible improvement in my character, or\nmy conduct; and now he was resolved to put me out--as he said--“_to be\nbroken._”\n\nThere was, in the Bay Side, very near the camp ground, where my master\ngot his religious impressions, a man named Edward Covey, who enjoyed\nthe execrated reputation, of being a first rate hand at breaking young\nNegroes. This Covey was a poor man, a farm renter; and this reputation\n(hateful as it was to the slaves and to all good men) was, at the same\ntime, of immense advantage to him. It enabled him to get his farm tilled\nwith very little expense, compared with what it would have cost him\nwithout this most extraordinary reputation. Some slaveholders thought it\nan advantage to let Mr. Covey have the government of their slaves a year\nor two, almost free of charge, for the sake of the excellent training\nsuch slaves got under his happy management! Like some horse breakers,\nnoted for their skill, who ride the best horses in the country without\nexpense, Mr. Covey could have under him, the most fiery bloods of the\nneighborhood, for the simple reward of returning them to their owners,\n_well broken_. Added to the natural fitness of Mr. Covey for the duties\nof his profession, he was said to “enjoy religion,” and was as strict\nin the cultivation of piety, as he was in the cultivation of his farm. I\nwas made aware of his character by some who had been under his hand; and\nwhile I could not look forward to going to him with any pleasure, I was\nglad to get away from St. Michael’s. I was sure of getting enough to eat\nat Covey’s, even if I suffered in other respects. _This_, to a hungry\nman, is not a prospect to be regarded with indifference.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. _Covey, the Negro Breaker_\n\nJOURNEY TO MY NEW MASTER’S--MEDITATIONS BY THE WAY--VIEW OF COVEY’S\nRESIDENCE--THE FAMILY--MY AWKWARDNESS AS A FIELD HAND--A CRUEL\nBEATING--WHY IT WAS GIVEN--DESCRIPTION OF COVEY--FIRST ADVENTURE AT OX\nDRIVING--HAIR BREADTH ESCAPES--OX AND MAN ALIKE PROPERTY--COVEY’S MANNER\nOF PROCEEDING TO WHIP--HARD LABOR BETTER THAN THE WHIP FOR BREAKING\nDOWN THE SPIRIT--CUNNING AND TRICKERY OF COVEY--FAMILY WORSHIP--SHOCKING\nCONTEMPT FOR CHASTITY--I AM BROKEN DOWN--GREAT MENTAL AGITATION IN\nCONTRASTING THE FREEDOM OF THE SHIPS WITH HIS OWN SLAVERY--ANGUISH\nBEYOND DESCRIPTION.\n\n\nThe morning of the first of January, 1834, with its chilling wind and\npinching frost, quite in harmony with the winter in my own mind, found\nme, with my little bundle of clothing on the end of a stick, swung\nacross my shoulder, on the main road, bending my way toward Covey’s,\nwhither I had been imperiously ordered by Master Thomas. The latter had\nbeen as good as his word, and had committed me, without reserve, to the\nmastery of Mr. Edward Covey. Eight or ten years had now passed since\nI had been taken from my grandmother’s cabin, in Tuckahoe; and these\nyears, for the most part, I had spent in Baltimore, where--as the reader\nhas already seen--I was treated with comparative tenderness. I was now\nabout to sound profounder depths in slave life. The rigors of a field,\nless tolerable than the field of battle, awaited me. My new master was\nnotorious for his fierce and savage disposition, and my only consolation\nin going to live{160} with him was, the certainty of finding him\nprecisely as represented by common fame. There was neither joy in my\nheart, nor elasticity in my step, as I started in search of the tyrant’s\nhome. Starvation made me glad to leave Thomas Auld’s, and the cruel lash\nmade me dread to go to Covey’s. Escape was impossible; so, heavy and\nsad, I paced the seven miles, which separated Covey’s house from St.\nMichael’s--thinking much by the solitary way--averse to my condition;\nbut _thinking_ was all I could do. Like a fish in a net, allowed to play\nfor a time, I was now drawn rapidly to the shore, secured at all points.\n“I am,” thought I, “but the sport of a power which makes no account,\neither of my welfare or of my happiness. By a law which I can clearly\ncomprehend, but cannot evade nor resist, I am ruthlessly snatched from\nthe hearth of a fond grandmother, and hurried away to the home of a\nmysterious ‘old master;’ again I am removed from there, to a master in\nBaltimore; thence am I snatched away to the Eastern Shore, to be valued\nwith the beasts of the field, and, with them, divided and set apart for\na possessor; then I am sent back to Baltimore; and by the time I have\nformed new attachments, and have begun to hope that no more rude shocks\nshall touch me, a difference arises between brothers, and I am again\nbroken up, and sent to St. Michael’s; and now, from the latter place,\nI am footing my way to the home of a new master, where, I am given to\nunderstand, that, like a wild young working animal, I am to be broken to\nthe yoke of a bitter and life-long bondage.”\n\nWith thoughts and reflections like these, I came in sight of a small\nwood-colored building, about a mile from the main road, which, from the\ndescription I had received, at starting, I easily recognized as my new\nhome. The Chesapeake bay--upon the jutting banks of which the little\nwood-colored house was standing--white with foam, raised by the heavy\nnorth-west wind; Poplar Island, covered with a thick, black pine forest,\nstanding out amid this half ocean; and Kent Point, stretching its sandy,\ndesert-like shores out into the foam-cested bay--were all in{161} sight,\nand deepened the wild and desolate aspect of my new home.\n\nThe good clothes I had brought with me from Baltimore were now worn\nthin, and had not been replaced; for Master Thomas was as little careful\nto provide us against cold, as against hunger. Met here by a north wind,\nsweeping through an open space of forty miles, I was glad to make any\nport; and, therefore, I speedily pressed on to the little wood-colored\nhouse. The family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Covey; Miss Kemp (a\nbroken-backed woman) a sister of Mrs. Covey; William Hughes, cousin to\nEdward Covey; Caroline, the cook; Bill Smith, a hired man; and myself.\nBill Smith, Bill Hughes, and myself, were the working force of the farm,\nwhich consisted of three or four hundred acres. I was now, for the first\ntime in my life, to be a field hand; and in my new employment I found\nmyself even more awkward than a green country boy may be supposed to be,\nupon his first entrance into the bewildering scenes of city life; and my\nawkwardness gave me much trouble. Strange and unnatural as it may seem,\nI had been at my new home but three days, before Mr. Covey (my brother\nin the Methodist church) gave me a bitter foretaste of what was in\nreserve for me. I presume he thought, that since he had but a single\nyear in which to complete his work, the sooner he began, the better.\nPerhaps he thought that by coming to blows at once, we should mutually\nbetter understand our relations. But to whatever motive, direct or\nindirect, the cause may be referred, I had not been in his possession\nthree whole days, before he subjected me to a most brutal chastisement.\nUnder his heavy blows, blood flowed freely, and wales were left on\nmy back as large as my little finger. The sores on my back, from this\nflogging, continued for weeks, for they were kept open by the rough and\ncoarse cloth which I wore for shirting. The occasion and details of this\nfirst chapter of my experience as a field hand, must be told, that the\nreader may see how unreasonable, as well as how cruel, my new master,\nCovey, was.{162} The whole thing I found to be characteristic of the\nman; and I was probably treated no worse by him than scores of lads who\nhad previously been committed to him, for reasons similar to those\nwhich induced my master to place me with him. But, here are the facts\nconnected with the affair, precisely as they occurred.\n\nOn one of the coldest days of the whole month of January, 1834, I was\nordered, at day break, to get a load of wood, from a forest about two\nmiles from the house. In order to perform this work, Mr. Covey gave me\na pair of unbroken oxen, for, it seems, his breaking abilities had\nnot been turned in this direction; and I may remark, in passing, that\nworking animals in the south, are seldom so well trained as in the\nnorth. In due form, and with all proper ceremony, I was introduced\nto this huge yoke of unbroken oxen, and was carefully told which was\n“Buck,” and which was “Darby”--which was the “in hand,” and which was\nthe “off hand” ox. The master of this important ceremony was no less a\nperson than Mr. Covey, himself; and the introduction was the first of\nthe kind I had ever had. My life, hitherto, had led me away from horned\ncattle, and I had no knowledge of the art of managing them. What was\nmeant by the “in ox,” as against the “off ox,” when both were equally\nfastened to one cart, and under one yoke, I could not very easily\ndivine; and the difference, implied by the names, and the peculiar\nduties of each, were alike _Greek_ to me. Why was not the “off ox”\n called the “in ox?” Where and what is the reason for this distinction in\nnames, when there is none in the things themselves? After initiating\nme into the _“woa,” “back” “gee,” “hither”_--the entire spoken language\nbetween oxen and driver--Mr. Covey took a rope, about ten feet long and\none inch thick, and placed one end of it around the horns of the “in\nhand ox,” and gave the other end to me, telling me that if the oxen\nstarted to run away, as the scamp knew they would, I must hold on to\nthe rope and stop them. I need not tell any one who is acquainted with\neither the strength of the disposition of an untamed ox, that this\norder{163} was about as unreasonable as a command to shoulder a mad\nbull! I had never driven oxen before, and I was as awkward, as a\ndriver, as it is possible to conceive. It did not answer for me to plead\nignorance, to Mr. Covey; there was something in his manner that quite\nforbade that. He was a man to whom a slave seldom felt any disposition\nto speak. Cold, distant, morose, with a face wearing all the marks of\ncaptious pride and malicious sternness, he repelled all advances. Covey\nwas not a large man; he was only about five feet ten inches in height,\nI should think; short necked, round shoulders; of quick and wiry motion,\nof thin and wolfish visage; with a pair of small, greenish-gray eyes,\nset well back under a forehead without dignity, and constantly in\nmotion, and floating his passions, rather than his thoughts, in\nsight, but denying them utterance in words. The creature presented\nan appearance altogether ferocious and sinister, disagreeable and\nforbidding, in the extreme. When he spoke, it was from the corner of his\nmouth, and in a sort of light growl, like a dog, when an attempt is made\nto take a bone from him. The fellow had already made me believe him even\n_worse_ than he had been presented. With his directions, and without\nstopping to question, I started for the woods, quite anxious to perform\nmy first exploit in driving, in a creditable manner. The distance from\nthe house to the woods gate a full mile, I should think--was passed over\nwith very little difficulty; for although the animals ran, I was fleet\nenough, in the open field, to keep pace with them; especially as they\npulled me along at the end of the rope; but, on reaching the woods, I\nwas speedily thrown into a distressing plight. The animals took fright,\nand started off ferociously into the woods, carrying the cart, full\ntilt, against trees, over stumps, and dashing from side to side, in a\nmanner altogether frightful. As I held the rope, I expected every moment\nto be crushed between the cart and the huge trees, among which they were\nso furiously dashing. After running thus for several minutes, my oxen\nwere, finally, brought to a stand, by a tree, against which they dashed\n{164} themselves with great violence, upsetting the cart, and entangling\nthemselves among sundry young saplings. By the shock, the body of the\ncart was flung in one direction, and the wheels and tongue in another,\nand all in the greatest confusion. There I was, all alone, in a thick\nwood, to which I was a stranger; my cart upset and shattered; my oxen\nentangled, wild, and enraged; and I, poor soul! but a green hand, to set\nall this disorder right. I knew no more of oxen than the ox driver is\nsupposed to know of wisdom. After standing a few moments surveying the\ndamage and disorder, and not without a presentiment that this trouble\nwould draw after it others, even more distressing, I took one end of the\ncart body, and, by an extra outlay of strength, I lifted it toward\nthe axle-tree, from which it had been violently flung; and after much\npulling and straining, I succeeded in getting the body of the cart in\nits place. This was an important step out of the difficulty, and its\nperformance increased my courage for the work which remained to be done.\nThe cart was provided with an ax, a tool with which I had become pretty\nwell acquainted in the ship yard at Baltimore. With this, I cut down the\nsaplings by which my oxen were entangled, and again pursued my journey,\nwith my heart in my mouth, lest the oxen should again take it into their\nsenseless heads to cut up a caper. My fears were groundless. Their spree\nwas over for the present, and the rascals now moved off as soberly as\nthough their behavior had been natural and exemplary. On reaching the\npart of the forest where I had been, the day before, chopping wood, I\nfilled the cart with a heavy load, as a security against another running\naway. But, the neck of an ox is equal in strength to iron. It defies\nall ordinary burdens, when excited. Tame and docile to a proverb, when\n_well_ trained, the ox is the most sullen and intractable of animals\nwhen but half broken to the yoke.\n\nI now saw, in my situation, several points of similarity with that of\nthe oxen. They were property, so was I; they were to be{165} broken,\nso was I. Covey was to break me, I was to break them; break and be\nbroken--such is life.\n\nHalf the day already gone, and my face not yet homeward! It required\nonly two day’s experience and observation to teach me, that such\napparent waste of time would not be lightly overlooked by Covey. I\ntherefore hurried toward home; but, on reaching the lane gate, I met\nwith the crowning disaster for the day. This gate was a fair specimen\nof southern handicraft. There were two huge posts, eighteen inches in\ndiameter, rough hewed and square, and the heavy gate was so hung on\none of these, that it opened only about half the proper distance. On\narriving here, it was necessary for me to let go the end of the rope on\nthe horns of the “in hand ox;” and now as soon as the gate was open, and\nI let go of it to get the rope, again, off went my oxen--making nothing\nof their load--full tilt; and in doing so they caught the huge gate\nbetween the wheel and the cart body, literally crushing it to splinters,\nand coming only within a few inches of subjecting me to a similar\ncrushing, for I was just in advance of the wheel when it struck the\nleft gate post. With these two hair-breadth escape, I thought I could\nsucessfully(sic) explain to Mr. Covey the delay, and avert apprehended\npunishment. I was not without a faint hope of being commended for the\nstern resolution which I had displayed in accomplishing the difficult\ntask--a task which, I afterwards learned, even Covey himself would not\nhave undertaken, without first driving the oxen for some time in the\nopen field, preparatory to their going into the woods. But, in this I\nwas disappointed. On coming to him, his countenance assumed an aspect of\nrigid displeasure, and, as I gave him a history of the casualties of\nmy trip, his wolfish face, with his greenish eyes, became intensely\nferocious. “Go back to the woods again,” he said, muttering something\nelse about wasting time. I hastily obeyed; but I had not gone far on my\nway, when I saw him coming after me. My oxen now behaved themselves\nwith singular{166} propriety, opposing their present conduct to my\nrepresentation of their former antics. I almost wished, now that Covey\nwas coming, they would do something in keeping with the character I had\ngiven them; but no, they had already had their spree, and they could\nafford now to be extra good, readily obeying my orders, and seeming to\nunderstand them quite as well as I did myself. On reaching the woods, my\ntormentor--who seemed all the way to be remarking upon the good\nbehavior of his oxen--came up to me, and ordered me to stop the cart,\naccompanying the same with the threat that he would now teach me how\nto break gates, and idle away my time, when he sent me to the woods.\nSuiting the action to the word, Covey paced off, in his own wiry\nfashion, to a large, black gum tree, the young shoots of which are\ngenerally used for ox _goads_, they being exceedingly tough. Three of\nthese _goads_, from four to six feet long, he cut off, and trimmed\nup, with his large jack-knife. This done, he ordered me to take off my\nclothes. To this unreasonable order I made no reply, but sternly refused\nto take off my clothing. “If you will beat me,” thought I, “you shall do\nso over my clothes.” After many threats, which made no impression on me,\nhe rushed at me with something of the savage fierceness of a wolf, tore\noff the few and thinly worn clothes I had on, and proceeded to wear out,\non my back, the heavy goads which he had cut from the gum tree. This\nflogging was the first of a series of floggings; and though very severe,\nit was less so than many which came after it, and these, for offenses\nfar lighter than the gate breaking.\n\nI remained with Mr. Covey one year (I cannot say I _lived_ with him) and\nduring the first six months that I was there, I was whipped, either with\nsticks or cowskins, every week. Aching bones and a sore back were my\nconstant companions. Frequent as the lash was used, Mr. Covey thought\nless of it, as a means of breaking down my spirit, than that of hard\nand long continued labor. He worked me steadily, up to the point of\nmy powers of endurance. From the dawn of day in the morning, till the\ndarkness{167} was complete in the evening, I was kept at hard work, in\nthe field or the woods. At certain seasons of the year, we were all kept\nin the field till eleven and twelve o’clock at night. At these times,\nCovey would attend us in the field, and urge us on with words or blows,\nas it seemed best to him. He had, in his life, been an overseer, and he\nwell understood the business of slave driving. There was no deceiving\nhim. He knew just what a man or boy could do, and he held both to strict\naccount. When he pleased, he would work himself, like a very Turk,\nmaking everything fly before him. It was, however, scarcely necessary\nfor Mr. Covey to be really present in the field, to have his work go on\nindustriously. He had the faculty of making us feel that he was always\npresent. By a series of adroitly managed surprises, which he practiced,\nI was prepared to expect him at any moment. His plan was, never to\napproach the spot where his hands were at work, in an open, manly and\ndirect manner. No thief was ever more artful in his devices than this\nman Covey. He would creep and crawl, in ditches and gullies; hide behind\nstumps and bushes, and practice so much of the cunning of the serpent,\nthat Bill Smith and I--between ourselves--never called him by any other\nname than _“the snake.”_ We fancied that in his eyes and his gait we\ncould see a snakish resemblance. One half of his proficiency in the\nart of Negro breaking, consisted, I should think, in this species of\ncunning. We were never secure. He could see or hear us nearly all the\ntime. He was, to us, behind every stump, tree, bush and fence on the\nplantation. He carried this kind of trickery so far, that he would\nsometimes mount his horse, and make believe he was going to St.\nMichael’s; and, in thirty minutes afterward, you might find his horse\ntied in the woods, and the snake-like Covey lying flat in the ditch,\nwith his head lifted above its edge, or in a fence corner, watching\nevery movement of the slaves! I have known him walk up to us and give us\nspecial orders, as to our work, in advance, as if he were leaving home\nwith a view to being absent several days; and before he got half way\nto the{168} house, he would avail himself of our inattention to his\nmovements, to turn short on his heels, conceal himself behind a fence\ncorner or a tree, and watch us until the going down of the sun. Mean and\ncontemptible as is all this, it is in keeping with the character which\nthe life of a slaveholder is calculated to produce. There is no earthly\ninducement, in the slave’s condition, to incite him to labor faithfully.\nThe fear of punishment is the sole motive for any sort of industry, with\nhim. Knowing this fact, as the slaveholder does, and judging the slave\nby himself, he naturally concludes the slave will be idle whenever the\ncause for this fear is absent. Hence, all sorts of petty deceptions are\npracticed, to inspire this fear.\n\nBut, with Mr. Covey, trickery was natural. Everything in the shape of\nlearning or religion, which he possessed, was made to conform to this\nsemi-lying propensity. He did not seem conscious that the practice had\nanything unmanly, base or contemptible about it. It was a part of an\nimportant system, with him, essential to the relation of master\nand slave. I thought I saw, in his very religious devotions, this\ncontrolling element of his character. A long prayer at night made up for\nthe short prayer in the morning; and few men could seem more devotional\nthan he, when he had nothing else to do.\n\nMr. Covey was not content with the cold style of family worship, adopted\nin these cold latitudes, which begin and end with a simple prayer. No!\nthe voice of praise, as well as of prayer, must be heard in his house,\nnight and morning. At first, I was called upon to bear some part in\nthese exercises; but the repeated flogging given me by Covey, turned the\nwhole thing into mockery. He was a poor singer, and mainly relied on me\nfor raising the hymn for the family, and when I failed to do so, he was\nthrown into much confusion. I do not think that he ever abused me on\naccount of these vexations. His religion was a thing altogether apart\nfrom his worldly concerns. He knew nothing of it as a holy principle,\ndirecting and controlling his daily life,{169} making the latter conform\nto the requirements of the gospel. One or two facts will illustrate his\ncharacter better than a volume of generalties(sic).\n\nI have already said, or implied, that Mr. Edward Covey was a poor man.\nHe was, in fact, just commencing to lay the foundation of his fortune,\nas fortune is regarded in a slave state. The first condition of wealth\nand respectability there, being the ownership of human property, every\nnerve is strained, by the poor man, to obtain it, and very little regard\nis had to the manner of obtaining it. In pursuit of this object, pious\nas Mr. Covey was, he proved himself to be as unscrupulous and base as\nthe worst of his neighbors. In the beginning, he was only able--as he\nsaid--“to buy one slave;” and, scandalous and shocking as is the fact,\nhe boasted that he bought her simply “_as a breeder_.” But the worst\nis not told in this naked statement. This young woman (Caroline was her\nname) was virtually compelled by Mr. Covey to abandon herself to the\nobject for which he had purchased her; and the result was, the birth of\ntwins at the end of the year. At this addition to his human stock, both\nEdward Covey and his wife, Susan, were ecstatic with joy. No one dreamed\nof reproaching the woman, or of finding fault with the hired man--Bill\nSmith--the father of the children, for Mr. Covey himself had locked the\ntwo up together every night, thus inviting the result.\n\nBut I will pursue this revolting subject no further. No better\nillustration of the unchaste and demoralizing character of slavery can\nbe found, than is furnished in the fact that this professedly Christian\nslaveholder, amidst all his prayers and hymns, was shamelessly and\nboastfully encouraging, and actually compelling, in his own house,\nundisguised and unmitigated fornication, as a means of increasing his\nhuman stock. I may remark here, that, while this fact will be read with\ndisgust and shame at the north, it will be _laughed at_, as smart and\npraiseworthy in Mr. Covey, at the south; for a man is no more condemned\nthere for buying a woman and devoting her to this life of dishonor,{170}\nthan for buying a cow, and raising stock from her. The same rules\nare observed, with a view to increasing the number and quality of the\nformer, as of the latter.\n\nI will here reproduce what I said of my own experience in this wretched\nplace, more than ten years ago:\n\n\nIf at any one time of my life, more than another, I was made to drink\nthe bitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six\nmonths of my stay with Mr. Covey. We were worked all weathers. It was\nnever too hot or too cold; it could never rain, blow, snow, or hail too\nhard for us to work in the field. Work, work, work, was scarcely more\nthe order of the day than the night. The longest days were too short\nfor him, and the shortest nights were too long for him. I was somewhat\nunmanageable when I first went there; but a few months of his discipline\ntamed me. Mr. Covey succeeded in breaking me. I was broken in body, soul\nand spirit. My natural elasticity was crushed; my intellect languished;\nthe disposition to read departed; the cheerful spark that lingered about\nmy eye died; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me; and behold a\nman transformed into a brute!\n\nSunday was my only leisure time. I spent this in a sort of beast-like\nstupor, between sleep and wake, under some large tree. At times, I\nwould rise up, a flash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul,\naccompanied with a faint beam of hope, flickered for a moment, and then\nvanished. I sank down again, mourning over my wretched condition. I was\nsometimes prompted to take my life, and that of Covey, but was prevented\nby a combination of hope and fear. My sufferings on this plantation seem\nnow like a dream rather than a stern reality.\n\nOur house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake bay, whose broad\nbosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable\nglobe. Those beautiful vessels, robed in purest white, so delightful to\nthe eye of freemen, were to me so many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and\ntorment me with thoughts of my wretched condition. I have often, in the\ndeep stillness of a summer’s Sabbath, stood all alone upon the banks\nof that noble bay, and traced, with saddened heart and tearful eye, the\ncountless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean. The sight of\nthese always affected me powerfully. My thoughts would compel utterance;\nand there, with no audience but the Almighty, I would pour out my soul’s\ncomplaint in my rude way, with an apostrophe to the moving multitude of\nships:\n\n“You are loosed from your moorings, and free; I am fast in my chains,\nand am a slave! You move merrily before the gentle gale, and I sadly\nbefore the bloody whip! You are freedom’s swift-winged angels, that fly\naround the world; I am confined in bands of iron! O, that I were free!\nO, that I were on one of your gallant decks, and under your protecting\nwing! Alas! betwixt me{171} and you the turbid waters roll. Go on, go\non. O that I could also go! Could I but swim! If I could fly! O, why was\nI born a man, of whom to make a brute! The glad ship is gone; she hides\nin the dim distance. I am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery.\nO God, save me! God, deliver me! Let me be free! Is there any God? Why\nam I a slave? I will run away. I will not stand it. Get caught, or get\nclear, I’ll try it. I had as well die with ague as with fever. I have\nonly one life to lose. I had as well be killed running as die standing.\nOnly think of it; one hundred miles straight north, and I am free! Try\nit? Yes! God helping me, I will. It cannot be that I shall live and die\na slave. I will take to the water. This very bay shall yet bear me into\nfreedom. The steamboats steered in a north-east coast from North Point.\nI will do the same; and when I get to the head of the bay, I will turn\nmy canoe adrift, and walk straight through Delaware into Pennsylvania.\nWhen I get there, I shall not be required to have a pass; I will travel\nwithout being disturbed. Let but the first opportunity offer, and come\nwhat will, I am off. Meanwhile, I will try to bear up under the yoke.\nI am not the only slave in the world. Why should I fret? I can bear as\nmuch as any of them. Besides, I am but a boy, and all boys are bound\nto some one. It may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my\nhappiness when I get free. There is a better day coming.”\n\nI shall never be able to narrate the mental experience through which it\nwas my lot to pass during my stay at Covey’s. I was completely wrecked,\nchanged and bewildered; goaded almost to madness at one time, and at\nanother reconciling myself to my wretched condition. Everything in the\nway of kindness, which I had experienced at Baltimore; all my former\nhopes and aspirations for usefulness in the world, and the happy moments\nspent in the exercises of religion, contrasted with my then present lot,\nbut increased my anguish.\n\nI suffered bodily as well as mentally. I had neither sufficient time\nin which to eat or to sleep, except on Sundays. The overwork, and the\nbrutal chastisements of which I was the victim, combined with that\never-gnawing and soul-devouring thought--“_I am a slave--a slave for\nlife--a slave with no rational ground to hope for freedom_”--rendered me\na living embodiment of mental and physical wretchedness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. _Another Pressure of the Tyrant’s Vice_\n\nEXPERIENCE AT COVEY’S SUMMED UP--FIRST SIX MONTHS SEVERER THAN\nTHE SECOND--PRELIMINARIES TO THE CHANCE--REASONS FOR NARRATING THE\nCIRCUMSTANCES--SCENE IN TREADING YARD--TAKEN ILL--UNUSUAL BRUTALITY\nOF COVEY--ESCAPE TO ST.

The reader has but to repeat, in his own mind,\nonce a week, the scene in the woods, where Covey subjected me to his\nmerciless lash, to have a true idea of my bitter experience there,\nduring the first period of the breaking process through which Mr. Covey\ncarried me. I have no heart to repeat each separate transaction, in\nwhich I was victim of his violence and brutality. Such a narration would\nfill a volume much larger than the present one. I aim only to give the\nreader a truthful impression of my slave life, without unnecessarily\naffecting him with harrowing details.\n\nAs I have elsewhere intimated that my hardships were much greater during\nthe first six months of my stay at Covey’s, than during the remainder\nof the year, and as the change in my condition was owing to causes which\nmay help the reader to a better understanding of human nature, when\nsubjected to the terrible extremities of slavery, I will narrate the\ncircumstances of this{173} change, although I may seem thereby\nto applaud my own courage. You have, dear reader, seen me humbled,\ndegraded, broken down, enslaved, and brutalized, and you understand how\nit was done; now let us see the converse of all this, and how it was\nbrought about; and this will take us through the year 1834.\n\nOn one of the hottest days of the month of August, of the year just\nmentioned, had the reader been passing through Covey’s farm, he might\nhave seen me at work, in what is there called the “treading yard”--a\nyard upon which wheat is trodden out from the straw, by the horses’\nfeet. I was there, at work, feeding the “fan,” or rather bringing wheat\nto the fan, while Bill Smith was feeding. Our force consisted of Bill\nHughes, Bill Smith, and a slave by the name of Eli; the latter having\nbeen hired for this occasion. The work was simple, and required strength\nand activity, rather than any skill or intelligence, and yet, to one\nentirely unused to such work, it came very hard. The heat was intense\nand overpowering, and there was much hurry to get the wheat, trodden out\nthat day, through the fan; since, if that work was done an hour before\nsundown, the hands would have, according to a promise of Covey, that\nhour added to their night’s rest. I was not behind any of them in the\nwish to complete the day’s work before sundown, and, hence, I struggled\nwith all my might to get the work forward. The promise of one hour’s\nrepose on a week day, was sufficient to quicken my pace, and to spur me\non to extra endeavor. Besides, we had all planned to go fishing, and I\ncertainly wished to have a hand in that. But I was disappointed, and\nthe day turned out to be one of the bitterest I ever experienced. About\nthree o’clock, while the sun was pouring down his burning rays, and not\na breeze was stirring, I broke down; my strength failed me; I was seized\nwith a violent aching of the head, attended with extreme dizziness, and\ntrembling in every limb. Finding what was coming, and feeling it would\nnever do to stop work, I nerved myself up, and staggered on until I fell\nby the side of the wheat fan, feeling that the earth had fallen{174}\nupon me. This brought the entire work to a dead stand. There was work\nfor four; each one had his part to perform, and each part depended on\nthe other, so that when one stopped, all were compelled to stop. Covey,\nwho had now become my dread, as well as my tormentor, was at the house,\nabout a hundred yards from where I was fanning, and instantly, upon\nhearing the fan stop, he came down to the treading yard, to inquire into\nthe cause of our stopping. Bill Smith told him I was sick, and that I\nwas unable longer to bring wheat to the fan.\n\nI had, by this time, crawled away, under the side of a post-and-rail\nfence, in the shade, and was exceeding ill. The intense heat of the sun,\nthe heavy dust rising from the fan, the stooping, to take up the wheat\nfrom the yard, together with the hurrying, to get through, had caused a\nrush of blood to my head. In this condition, Covey finding out where I\nwas, came to me; and, after standing over me a while, he asked me\nwhat the matter was. I told him as well as I could, for it was with\ndifficulty that I could speak. He then gave me a savage kick in the\nside, which jarred my whole frame, and commanded me to get up. The man\nhad obtained complete control over me; and if he had commanded me to do\nany possible thing, I should, in my then state of mind, have endeavored\nto comply. I made an effort to rise, but fell back in the attempt,\nbefore gaining my feet. The brute now gave me another heavy kick, and\nagain told me to rise. I again tried to rise, and succeeded in gaining\nmy feet; but upon stooping to get the tub with which I was feeding\nthe fan, I again staggered and fell to the ground; and I must have so\nfallen, had I been sure that a hundred bullets would have pierced me,\nas the consequence. While down, in this sad condition, and perfectly\nhelpless, the merciless Negro breaker took up the hickory slab, with\nwhich Hughes had been striking off the wheat to a level with the sides\nof the half bushel measure (a very hard weapon) and with the sharp edge\nof it, he dealt me a heavy blow on my head which made a large gash, and\ncaused the blood to run freely, saying,{175} at the same time, “If _you\nhave got the headache, I’ll cure you_.” This done, he ordered me again\nto rise, but I made no effort to do so; for I had made up my mind that\nit was useless, and that the heartless monster might now do his worst;\nhe could but kill me, and that might put me out of my misery. Finding me\nunable to rise, or rather despairing of my doing so, Covey left me,\nwith a view to getting on with the work without me. I was bleeding\nvery freely, and my face was soon covered with my warm blood. Cruel and\nmerciless as was the motive that dealt that blow, dear reader, the wound\nwas fortunate for me. Bleeding was never more efficacious. The pain in\nmy head speedily abated, and I was soon able to rise. Covey had, as I\nhave said, now left me to my fate; and the question was, shall I return\nto my work, or shall I find my way to St. Michael’s, and make Capt. Auld\nacquainted with the atrocious cruelty of his brother Covey, and beseech\nhim to get me another master? Remembering the object he had in view,\nin placing me under the management of Covey, and further, his cruel\ntreatment of my poor crippled cousin, Henny, and his meanness in the\nmatter of feeding and clothing his slaves, there was little ground\nto hope for a favorable reception at the hands of Capt. Thomas Auld.\nNevertheless, I resolved to go straight to Capt. Auld, thinking that, if\nnot animated by motives of humanity, he might be induced to interfere\non my behalf from selfish considerations. “He cannot,” thought I, “allow\nhis property to be thus bruised and battered, marred and defaced; and\nI will go to him, and tell him the simple truth about the matter.” In\norder to get to St. Michael’s, by the most favorable and direct road,\nI must walk seven miles; and this, in my sad condition, was no easy\nperformance. I had already lost much blood; I was exhausted by over\nexertion; my sides were sore from the heavy blows planted there by the\nstout boots of Mr. Covey; and I was, in every way, in an unfavorable\nplight for the journey. I however watched my chance, while the cruel\nand cunning Covey was looking in an opposite direction, and started{176}\noff, across the field, for St. Michael’s. This was a daring step; if it\nfailed, it would only exasperate Covey, and increase the rigors of my\nbondage, during the remainder of my term of service under him; but the\nstep was taken, and I must go forward. I succeeded in getting nearly\nhalf way across the broad field, toward the woods, before Mr. Covey\nobserved me. I was still bleeding, and the exertion of running had\nstarted the blood afresh. _“Come back! Come back!”_ vociferated Covey,\nwith threats of what he would do if I did not return instantly. But,\ndisregarding his calls and his threats, I pressed on toward the woods\nas fast as my feeble state would allow. Seeing no signs of my stopping,\nCovey caused his horse to be brought out and saddled, as if he intended\nto pursue me. The race was now to be an unequal one; and, thinking I\nmight be overhauled by him, if I kept the main road, I walked nearly the\nwhole distance in the woods, keeping far enough from the road to\navoid detection and pursuit. But, I had not gone far, before my little\nstrength again failed me, and I laid down. The blood was still oozing\nfrom the wound in my head; and, for a time, I suffered more than I can\ndescribe. There I was, in the deep woods, sick and emaciated, pursued by\na wretch whose character for revolting cruelty beggars all opprobrious\nspeech--bleeding, and almost bloodless. I was not without the fear of\nbleeding to death. The thought of dying in the woods, all alone, and\nof being torn to pieces by the buzzards, had not yet been rendered\ntolerable by my many troubles and hardships, and I was glad when the\nshade of the trees, and the cool evening breeze, combined with my matted\nhair to stop the flow of blood. After lying there about three quarters\nof an hour, brooding over the singular and mournful lot to which I was\ndoomed, my mind passing over the whole scale or circle of belief\nand unbelief, from faith in the overruling providence of God, to the\nblackest atheism, I again took up my journey toward St. Michael’s, more\nweary and sad than in the morning when I left Thomas Auld’s for the home\nof Mr. Covey. I was bare-footed and bare-headed, and in{177} my shirt\nsleeves. The way was through bogs and briers, and I tore my feet often\nduring the journey. I was full five hours in going the seven or eight\nmiles; partly, because of the difficulties of the way, and partly,\nbecause of the feebleness induced by my illness, bruises and loss\nof blood. On gaining my master’s store, I presented an appearance of\nwretchedness and woe, fitted to move any but a heart of stone. From the\ncrown of my head to the sole of my feet, there were marks of blood. My\nhair was all clotted with dust and blood, and the back of my shirt was\nliterally stiff with the same. Briers and thorns had scarred and torn\nmy feet and legs, leaving blood marks there. Had I escaped from a den\nof tigers, I could not have looked worse than I did on reaching St.\nMichael’s. In this unhappy plight, I appeared before my professedly\n_Christian_ master, humbly to invoke the interposition of his power and\nauthority, to protect me from further abuse and violence. I had begun to\nhope, during the latter part of my tedious journey toward St. Michael’s,\nthat Capt. Auld would now show himself in a nobler light than I had ever\nbefore seen him. I was disappointed. I had jumped from a sinking ship\ninto the sea; I had fled from the tiger to something worse. I told him\nall the circumstances, as well as I could; how I was endeavoring to\nplease Covey; how hard I was at work in the present instance; how\nunwilling I sunk down under the heat, toil and pain; the brutal manner\nin which Covey had kicked me in the side; the gash cut in my head; my\nhesitation about troubling him (Capt. Auld) with complaints; but, that\nnow I felt it would not be best longer to conceal from him the outrages\ncommitted on me from time to time by Covey. At first, master Thomas\nseemed somewhat affected by the story of my wrongs, but he soon\nrepressed his feelings and became cold as iron. It was impossible--as I\nstood before him at the first--for him to seem indifferent. I distinctly\nsaw his human nature asserting its conviction against the slave system,\nwhich made cases like mine _possible;_ but, as I have said, humanity\nfell before the systematic tyranny of slavery. He first walked{178} the\nfloor, apparently much agitated by my story, and the sad spectacle\nI presented; but, presently, it was _his_ turn to talk. He began\nmoderately, by finding excuses for Covey, and ending with a full\njustification of him, and a passionate condemnation of me. “He had no\ndoubt I deserved the flogging. He did not believe I was sick; I was only\nendeavoring to get rid of work. My dizziness was laziness, and Covey did\nright to flog me, as he had done.” After thus fairly annihilating me,\nand rousing himself by his own eloquence, he fiercely demanded what I\nwished _him_ to do in the case!\n\nWith such a complete knock-down to all my hopes, as he had given me, and\nfeeling, as I did, my entire subjection to his power, I had very little\nheart to reply. I must not affirm my innocence of the allegations which\nhe had piled up against me; for that would be impudence, and would\nprobably call down fresh violence as well as wrath upon me. The guilt\nof a slave is always, and everywhere, presumed; and the innocence of the\nslaveholder or the slave employer, is always asserted. The word of the\nslave, against this presumption, is generally treated as impudence,\nworthy of punishment. “Do you contradict me, you rascal?” is a final\nsilencer of counter statements from the lips of a slave.\n\nCalming down a little in view of my silence and hesitation, and,\nperhaps, from a rapid glance at the picture of misery I presented, he\ninquired again, “what I would have him do?” Thus invited a second time,\nI told Master Thomas I wished him to allow me to get a new home and to\nfind a new master; that, as sure as I went back to live with Mr. Covey\nagain, I should be killed by him; that he would never forgive my coming\nto him (Capt. Auld) with a complaint against him (Covey); that, since I\nhad lived with him, he almost crushed my spirit, and I believed that\nhe would ruin me for future service; that my life was not safe in his\nhands. This, Master Thomas _(my brother in the church)_ regarded as\n“nonsence(sic).” “There was no danger of Mr. Covey’s killing me; he was\na good man, industrious and religious, and he would not think of{179}\nremoving me from that home; besides,” said he and this I found was the\nmost distressing thought of all to him--“if you should leave Covey now,\nthat your year has but half expired, I should lose your wages for the\nentire year. You belong to Mr. Covey for one year, and you _must go\nback_ to him, come what will. You must not trouble me with any more\nstories about Mr. Covey; and if you do not go immediately home, I will\nget hold of you myself.” This was just what I expected, when I found he\nhad _prejudged_ the case against me. “But, Sir,” I said, “I am sick and\ntired, and I cannot get home to-night.” At this, he again relented, and\nfinally he allowed me to remain all night at St. Michael’s; but said I\nmust be off early in the morning, and concluded his directions by making\nme swallow a huge dose of _epsom salts_--about the only medicine ever\nadministered to slaves.\n\nIt was quite natural for Master Thomas to presume I was feigning\nsickness to escape work, for he probably thought that were _he_ in the\nplace of a slave with no wages for his work, no praise for well doing,\nno motive for toil but the lash--he would try every possible scheme by\nwhich to escape labor. I say I have no doubt of this; the reason is,\nthat there are not, under the whole heavens, a set of men who cultivate\nsuch an intense dread of labor as do the slaveholders. The charge of\nlaziness against the slave is ever on their lips, and is the standing\napology for every species of cruelty and brutality. These men literally\n“bind heavy burdens, grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s\nshoulders; but they, themselves, will not move them with one of their\nfingers.”\n\nMy kind readers shall have, in the next chapter--what they were led,\nperhaps, to expect to find in this--namely: an account of my partial\ndisenthrallment from the tyranny of Covey, and the marked change which\nit brought about.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. _The Last Flogging_\n\nA SLEEPLESS NIGHT--RETURN TO COVEY’S--PURSUED BY COVEY--THE\nCHASE DEFEATED--VENGEANCE POSTPONED--MUSINGS IN THE WOODS--THE\nALTERNATIVE--DEPLORABLE SPECTACLE--NIGHT IN THE WOODS--EXPECTED\nATTACK--ACCOSTED BY SANDY, A FRIEND, NOT A HUNTER--SANDY’S\nHOSPITALITY--THE “ASH CAKE” SUPPER--THE INTERVIEW WITH SANDY--HIS\nADVICE--SANDY A CONJURER AS WELL AS A CHRISTIAN--THE MAGIC ROOT--STRANGE\nMEETING WITH COVEY--HIS MANNER--COVEY’S SUNDAY FACE--MY DEFENSIVE\nRESOLVE--THE FIGHT--THE VICTORY, AND ITS RESULTS.\n\n\nSleep itself does not always come to the relief of the weary in body,\nand the broken in spirit; especially when past troubles only foreshadow\ncoming disasters. The last hope had been extinguished. My master, who\nI did not venture to hope would protect me as _a man_, had even now\nrefused to protect me as _his property;_ and had cast me back, covered\nwith reproaches and bruises, into the hands of a stranger to that mercy\nwhich was the soul of the religion he professed. May the reader never\nspend such a night as that allotted to me, previous to the morning which\nwas to herald my return to the den of horrors from which I had made a\ntemporary escape.\n\nI remained all night--sleep I did not--at St. Michael’s; and in the\nmorning (Saturday) I started off, according to the order of Master\nThomas, feeling that I had no friend on earth, and doubting if I had one\nin heaven. I reached Covey’s about nine o’clock; and just as I stepped\ninto the field, before I had reached the house, Covey, true to his\nsnakish habits, darted out at me{181} from a fence corner, in which\nhe had secreted himself, for the purpose of securing me. He was amply\nprovided with a cowskin and a rope; and he evidently intended to _tie\nme up_, and to wreak his vengeance on me to the fullest extent. I should\nhave been an easy prey, had he succeeded in getting his hands upon me,\nfor I had taken no refreshment since noon on Friday; and this, together\nwith the pelting, excitement, and the loss of blood, had reduced my\nstrength. I, however, darted back into the woods, before the ferocious\nhound could get hold of me, and buried myself in a thicket, where he\nlost sight of me. The corn-field afforded me cover, in getting to the\nwoods. But for the tall corn, Covey would have overtaken me, and made me\nhis captive. He seemed very much chagrined that he did not catch me,\nand gave up the chase, very reluctantly; for I could see his angry\nmovements, toward the house from which he had sallied, on his foray.\n\nWell, now I am clear of Covey, and of his wrathful lash, for present.\nI am in the wood, buried in its somber gloom, and hushed in its solemn\nsilence; hid from all human eyes; shut in with nature and nature’s God,\nand absent from all human contrivances. Here was a good place to pray;\nto pray for help for deliverance--a prayer I had often made before. But\nhow could I pray? Covey could pray--Capt. Auld could pray--I would fain\npray; but doubts (arising partly from my own neglect of the means of\ngrace, and partly from the sham religion which everywhere prevailed,\ncast in my mind a doubt upon all religion, and led me to the conviction\nthat prayers were unavailing and delusive) prevented my embracing the\nopportunity, as a religious one. Life, in itself, had almost become\nburdensome to me. All my outward relations were against me; I must stay\nhere and starve (I was already hungry) or go home to Covey’s, and have\nmy flesh torn to pieces, and my spirit humbled under the cruel lash of\nCovey. This was the painful alternative presented to me. The day was\nlong and irksome. My physical condition was deplorable. I was weak, from\nthe toils of the previous day, and from the want of{182} food and rest;\nand had been so little concerned about my appearance, that I had not yet\nwashed the blood from my garments. I was an object of horror, even to\nmyself. Life, in Baltimore, when most oppressive, was a paradise to\nthis. What had I done, what had my parents done, that such a life as\nthis should be mine? That day, in the woods, I would have exchanged my\nmanhood for the brutehood of an ox.\n\nNight came. I was still in the woods, unresolved what to do. Hunger had\nnot yet pinched me to the point of going home, and I laid myself down in\nthe leaves to rest; for I had been watching for hunters all day, but\nnot being molested during the day, I expected no disturbance during the\nnight. I had come to the conclusion that Covey relied upon hunger to\ndrive me home; and in this I was quite correct--the facts showed that he\nhad made no effort to catch me, since morning.\n\nDuring the night, I heard the step of a man in the woods. He was coming\ntoward the place where I lay. A person lying still has the advantage\nover one walking in the woods, in the day time, and this advantage is\nmuch greater at night. I was not able to engage in a physical struggle,\nand I had recourse to the common resort of the weak. I hid myself in the\nleaves to prevent discovery. But, as the night rambler in the woods drew\nnearer, I found him to be a _friend_, not an enemy; it was a slave of\nMr. William Groomes, of Easton, a kind hearted fellow, named “Sandy.”\n Sandy lived with Mr. Kemp that year, about four miles from St.\nMichael’s. He, like myself had been hired out by the year; but, unlike\nmyself, had not been hired out to be broken. Sandy was the husband of a\nfree woman, who lived in the lower part of _“Potpie Neck,”_ and he was\nnow on his way through the woods, to see her, and to spend the Sabbath\nwith her.\n\nAs soon as I had ascertained that the disturber of my solitude was not\nan enemy, but the good-hearted Sandy--a man as famous among the slaves\nof the neighborhood for his good nature, as for his good sense I came\nout from my hiding place, and made{183} myself known to him. I explained\nthe circumstances of the past two days, which had driven me to the\nwoods, and he deeply compassionated my distress. It was a bold thing\nfor him to shelter me, and I could not ask him to do so; for, had I\nbeen found in his hut, he would have suffered the penalty of thirty-nine\nlashes on his bare back, if not something worse. But Sandy was too\ngenerous to permit the fear of punishment to prevent his relieving a\nbrother bondman from hunger and exposure; and, therefore, on his own\nmotion, I accompanied him to his home, or rather to the home of his\nwife--for the house and lot were hers. His wife was called up--for it\nwas now about midnight--a fire was made, some Indian meal was soon mixed\nwith salt and water, and an ash cake was baked in a hurry to relieve\nmy hunger. Sandy’s wife was not behind him in kindness--both seemed to\nesteem it a privilege to succor me; for, although I was hated by Covey\nand by my master, I was loved by the colored people, because _they_\nthought I was hated for my knowledge, and persecuted because I was\nfeared. I was the _only_ slave _now_ in that region who could read and\nwrite. There had been one other man, belonging to Mr. Hugh Hamilton, who\ncould read (his name was “Jim”), but he, poor fellow, had, shortly after\nmy coming into the neighborhood, been sold off to the far south. I saw\nJim ironed, in the cart, to be carried to Easton for sale--pinioned\nlike a yearling for the slaughter. My knowledge was now the pride of\nmy brother slaves; and, no doubt, Sandy felt something of the general\ninterest in me on that account. The supper was soon ready, and though I\nhave feasted since, with honorables, lord mayors and aldermen, over the\nsea, my supper on ash cake and cold water, with Sandy, was the meal, of\nall my life, most sweet to my taste, and now most vivid in my memory.\n\nSupper over, Sandy and I went into a discussion of what was _possible_\nfor me, under the perils and hardships which now overshadowed my path.\nThe question was, must I go back to Covey, or must I now tempt to run\naway? Upon a careful survey, the latter was found to be impossible; for\nI was on a narrow neck of land,{184} every avenue from which would bring\nme in sight of pursuers. There was the Chesapeake bay to the right,\nand “Pot-pie” river to the left, and St. Michael’s and its neighborhood\noccupying the only space through which there was any retreat.\n\nI found Sandy an old advisor. He was not only a religious man, but he\nprofessed to believe in a system for which I have no name. He was a\ngenuine African, and had inherited some of the so-called magical powers,\nsaid to be possessed by African and eastern nations. He told me that he\ncould help me; that, in those very woods, there was an herb, which in\nthe morning might be found, possessing all the powers required for my\nprotection (I put his thoughts in my own language); and that, if I would\ntake his advice, he would procure me the root of the herb of which he\nspoke. He told me further, that if I would take that root and wear it\non my right side, it would be impossible for Covey to strike me a blow;\nthat with this root about my person, no white man could whip me. He said\nhe had carried it for years, and that he had fully tested its virtues.\nHe had never received a blow from a slaveholder since he carried it; and\nhe never expected to receive one, for he always meant to carry that root\nas a protection. He knew Covey well, for Mrs. Covey was the daughter of\nMr. Kemp; and he (Sandy) had heard of the barbarous treatment to which I\nwas subjected, and he wanted to do something for me.\n\nNow all this talk about the root, was to me, very absurd and ridiculous,\nif not positively sinful. I at first rejected the idea that the simple\ncarrying a root on my right side (a root, by the way, over which I\nwalked every time I went into the woods) could possess any such magic\npower as he ascribed to it, and I was, therefore, not disposed to\ncumber my pocket with it. I had a positive aversion to all pretenders\nto _“divination.”_ It was beneath one of my intelligence to countenance\nsuch dealings with the devil, as this power implied. But, with all my\nlearning--it was really precious little--Sandy was more than a match\nfor me. “My book learning,” he said, “had not kept Covey off me” (a\npowerful{185} argument just then) and he entreated me, with flashing\neyes, to try this. If it did me no good, it could do me no harm, and it\nwould cost me nothing, any way. Sandy was so earnest, and so confident\nof the good qualities of this weed, that, to please him, rather than\nfrom any conviction of its excellence, I was induced to take it. He had\nbeen to me the good Samaritan, and had, almost providentially, found me,\nand helped me when I could not help myself; how did I know but that the\nhand of the Lord was in it? With thoughts of this sort, I took the roots\nfrom Sandy, and put them in my right hand pocket.\n\nThis was, of course, Sunday morning. Sandy now urged me to go home, with\nall speed, and to walk up bravely to the house, as though nothing had\nhappened. I saw in Sandy too deep an insight into human nature, with all\nhis superstition, not to have some respect for his advice; and perhaps,\ntoo, a slight gleam or shadow of his superstition had fallen upon me.\nAt any rate, I started off toward Covey’s, as directed by Sandy. Having,\nthe previous night, poured my griefs into Sandy’s ears, and got him\nenlisted in my behalf, having made his wife a sharer in my sorrows,\nand having, also, become well refreshed by sleep and food, I moved off,\nquite courageously, toward the much dreaded Covey’s. Singularly enough,\njust as I entered his yard gate, I met him and his wife, dressed in\ntheir Sunday best--looking as smiling as angels--on their way to church.\nThe manner of Covey astonished me. There was something really benignant\nin his countenance. He spoke to me as never before; told me that the\npigs had got into the lot, and he wished me to drive them out; inquired\nhow I was, and seemed an altered man. This extraordinary conduct of\nCovey, really made me begin to think that Sandy’s herb had more virtue\nin it than I, in my pride, had been willing to allow; and, had the day\nbeen other than Sunday, I should have attributed Covey’s altered manner\nsolely to the magic power of the root. I suspected, however, that the\n_Sabbath_, and not the _root_, was the real explanation of Covey’s\nmanner. His religion hindered him from breaking the{186} Sabbath, but\nnot from breaking my skin. He had more respect for the _day_ than for\nthe _man_, for whom the day was mercifully given; for while he would cut\nand slash my body during the week, he would not hesitate, on Sunday, to\nteach me the value of my soul, or the way of life and salvation by Jesus\nChrist.\n\nAll went well with me till Monday morning; and then, whether the root\nhad lost its virtue, or whether my tormentor had gone deeper into the\nblack art than myself (as was sometimes said of him), or whether he had\nobtained a special indulgence, for his faithful Sabbath day’s worship,\nit is not necessary for me to know, or to inform the reader; but, this\nI _may_ say--the pious and benignant smile which graced Covey’s face on\n_Sunday_, wholly disappeared on _Monday_. Long before daylight, I was\ncalled up to go and feed, rub, and curry the horses. I obeyed the call,\nand would have so obeyed it, had it been made at an earilier(sic)\nhour, for I had brought my mind to a firm resolve, during that Sunday’s\nreflection, viz: to obey every order, however unreasonable, if it were\npossible, and, if Mr. Covey should then undertake to beat me, to defend\nand protect myself to the best of my ability. My religious views on the\nsubject of resisting my master, had suffered a serious shock, by the\nsavage persecution to which I had been subjected, and my hands were no\nlonger tied by my religion. Master Thomas’s indifference had served the\nlast link. I had now to this extent “backslidden” from this point in the\nslave’s religious creed; and I soon had occasion to make my fallen state\nknown to my Sunday-pious brother, Covey.\n\nWhilst I was obeying his order to feed and get the horses ready for the\nfield, and when in the act of going up the stable loft for the purpose\nof throwing down some blades, Covey sneaked into the stable, in his\npeculiar snake-like way, and seizing me suddenly by the leg, he brought\nme to the stable floor, giving my newly mended body a fearful jar. I\nnow forgot my roots, and remembered my pledge to _stand up in my own\ndefense_. The brute was endeavoring skillfully to get a slip-knot on my\nlegs, before I could{187} draw up my feet. As soon as I found what he\nwas up to, I gave a sudden spring (my two day’s rest had been of much\nservice to me,) and by that means, no doubt, he was able to bring me\nto the floor so heavily. He was defeated in his plan of tying me. While\ndown, he seemed to think he had me very securely in his power. He little\nthought he was--as the rowdies say--“in” for a “rough and tumble”\n fight; but such was the fact. Whence came the daring spirit necessary\nto grapple with a man who, eight-and-forty hours before, could, with\nhis slightest word have made me tremble like a leaf in a storm, I do\nnot know; at any rate, _I was resolved to fight_, and, what was better\nstill, I was actually hard at it. The fighting madness had come upon\nme, and I found my strong fingers firmly attached to the throat of\nmy cowardly tormentor; as heedless of consequences, at the moment, as\nthough we stood as equals before the law. The very color of the man\nwas forgotten. I felt as supple as a cat, and was ready for the snakish\ncreature at every turn. Every blow of his was parried, though I dealt\nno blows in turn. I was strictly on the _defensive_, preventing him from\ninjuring me, rather than trying to injure him. I flung him on the ground\nseveral times, when he meant to have hurled me there. I held him so\nfirmly by the throat, that his blood followed my nails. He held me, and\nI held him.\n\nAll was fair, thus far, and the contest was about equal. My resistance\nwas entirely unexpected, and Covey was taken all aback by it, for he\ntrembled in every limb. _“Are you going to resist_, you scoundrel?”\n said he. To which, I returned a polite _“Yes sir;”_ steadily gazing my\ninterrogator in the eye, to meet the first approach or dawning of the\nblow, which I expected my answer would call forth. But, the conflict did\nnot long remain thus equal. Covey soon cried out lustily for help; not\nthat I was obtaining any marked advantage over him, or was injuring\nhim, but because he was gaining none over me, and was not able, single\nhanded, to conquer me. He called for his cousin Hughs, to come to his\nassistance, and now the scene was changed. I was compelled to{188}\ngive blows, as well as to parry them; and, since I was, in any case, to\nsuffer for resistance, I felt (as the musty proverb goes) that “I might\nas well be hanged for an old sheep as a lamb.” I was still _defensive_\ntoward Covey, but _aggressive_ toward Hughs; and, at the first approach\nof the latter, I dealt a blow, in my desperation, which fairly sickened\nmy youthful assailant. He went off, bending over with pain, and\nmanifesting no disposition to come within my reach again. The poor\nfellow was in the act of trying to catch and tie my right hand, and\nwhile flattering himself with success, I gave him the kick which sent\nhim staggering away in pain, at the same time that I held Covey with a\nfirm hand.\n\nTaken completely by surprise, Covey seemed to have lost his usual\nstrength and coolness. He was frightened, and stood puffing and blowing,\nseemingly unable to command words or blows. When he saw that poor Hughes\nwas standing half bent with pain--his courage quite gone the cowardly\ntyrant asked if I “meant to persist in my resistance.” I told him “_I\ndid mean to resist, come what might_;” that I had been by him treated\nlike a _brute_, during the last six months; and that I should stand it\n_no longer_. With that, he gave me a shake, and attempted to drag me\ntoward a stick of wood, that was lying just outside the stable door. He\nmeant to knock me down with it; but, just as he leaned over to get the\nstick, I seized him with both hands by the collar, and, with a vigorous\nand sudden snatch, I brought my assailant harmlessly, his full length,\non the _not_ overclean ground--for we were now in the cow yard. He had\nselected the place for the fight, and it was but right that he should\nhave all the advantges(sic) of his own selection.\n\nBy this time, Bill, the hiredman, came home. He had been to Mr.\nHemsley’s, to spend the Sunday with his nominal wife, and was coming\nhome on Monday morning, to go to work. Covey and I had been skirmishing\nfrom before daybreak, till now, that the sun was almost shooting his\nbeams over the eastern woods, and we were still at it. I could not see\nwhere the matter was to terminate. He evidently was afraid to let me\ngo, lest I should again{189} make off to the woods; otherwise, he would\nprobably have obtained arms from the house, to frighten me. Holding me,\nCovey called upon Bill for assistance. The scene here, had something\ncomic about it. “Bill,” who knew _precisely_ what Covey wished him to\ndo, affected ignorance, and pretended he did not know what to do. “What\nshall I do, Mr. Covey,” said Bill. “Take hold of him--take hold of him!”\n said Covey. With a toss of his head, peculiar to Bill, he said, “indeed,\nMr. Covey I want to go to work.” _“This is_ your work,” said Covey;\n“take hold of him.” Bill replied, with spirit, “My master hired me here,\nto work, and _not_ to help you whip Frederick.” It was now my turn\nto speak. “Bill,” said I, “don’t put your hands on me.” To which he\nreplied, “My GOD! Frederick, I ain’t goin’ to tech ye,” and Bill walked\noff, leaving Covey and myself to settle our matters as best we might.\n\nBut, my present advantage was threatened when I saw Caroline (the\nslave-woman of Covey) coming to the cow yard to milk, for she was a\npowerful woman, and could have mastered me very easily, exhausted as I\nnow was. As soon as she came into the yard, Covey attempted to rally her\nto his aid. Strangely--and, I may add, fortunately--Caroline was in no\nhumor to take a hand in any such sport. We were all in open rebellion,\nthat morning. Caroline answered the command of her master to _“take hold\nof me,”_ precisely as Bill had answered, but in _her_, it was at greater\nperil so to answer; she was the slave of Covey, and he could do what he\npleased with her. It was _not_ so with Bill, and Bill knew it. Samuel\nHarris, to whom Bill belonged, did not allow his slaves to be beaten,\nunless they were guilty of some crime which the law would punish. But,\npoor Caroline, like myself, was at the mercy of the merciless Covey;\nnor did she escape the dire effects of her refusal. He gave her several\nsharp blows.\n\nCovey at length (two hours had elapsed) gave up the contest. Letting me\ngo, he said--puffing and blowing at a great rate--“Now, you scoundrel,\ngo to your work; I would not have whipped you half so much as I have had\nyou not resisted.” The fact was,{190} _he had not whipped me at all_.\nHe had not, in all the scuffle, drawn a single drop of blood from me. I\nhad drawn blood from him; and, even without this satisfaction, I should\nhave been victorious, because my aim had not been to injure him, but to\nprevent his injuring me.\n\nDuring the whole six months that I lived with Covey, after this\ntransaction, he never laid on me the weight of his finger in anger.\nHe would, occasionally, say he did not want to have to get hold of me\nagain--a declaration which I had no difficulty in believing; and I had\na secret feeling, which answered, “You need not wish to get hold of me\nagain, for you will be likely to come off worse in a second fight than\nyou did in the first.”\n\nWell, my dear reader, this battle with Mr. Covey--undignified as it was,\nand as I fear my narration of it is--was the turning point in my _“life\nas a slave_.” It rekindled in my breast the smouldering embers of\nliberty; it brought up my Baltimore dreams, and revived a sense of my\nown manhood. I was a changed being after that fight. I was _nothing_\nbefore; I WAS A MAN NOW. It recalled to life my crushed self-respect and\nmy self-confidence, and inspired me with a renewed determination to be\nA FREEMAN. A man, without force, is without the essential dignity of\nhumanity. Human nature is so constituted, that it cannot _honor_ a\nhelpless man, although it can _pity_ him; and even this it cannot do\nlong, if the signs of power do not arise.\n\nHe can only understand the effect of this combat on my spirit, who has\nhimself incurred something, hazarded something, in repelling the unjust\nand cruel aggressions of a tyrant. Covey was a tyrant, and a cowardly\none, withal. After resisting him, I felt as I had never felt before. It\nwas a resurrection from the dark and pestiferous tomb of slavery, to\nthe heaven of comparative freedom. I was no longer a servile coward,\ntrembling under the frown of a brother worm of the dust, but, my\nlong-cowed spirit was roused to an attitude of manly independence. I had\nreached the point, at which I was _not afraid to die_. This{191} spirit\nmade me a freeman in _fact_, while I remained a slave in _form_. When\na slave cannot be flogged he is more than half free. He has a domain as\nbroad as his own manly heart to defend, and he is really _“a power on\nearth_.” While slaves prefer their lives, with flogging, to instant\ndeath, they will always find Christians enough, like unto Covey, to\naccommodate that preference. From this time, until that of my escape\nfrom slavery, I was never fairly whipped. Several attempts were made\nto whip me, but they were always unsuccessful. Bruises I did get, as I\nshall hereafter inform the reader; but the case I have been describing,\nwas the end of the brutification to which slavery had subjected me.\n\nThe reader will be glad to know why, after I had so grievously offended\nMr. Covey, he did not have me taken in hand by the authorities; indeed,\nwhy the law of Maryland, which assigns hanging to the slave who resists\nhis master, was not put in force against me; at any rate, why I was\nnot taken up, as is usual in such cases, and publicly whipped, for an\nexample to other slaves, and as a means of deterring me from committing\nthe same offense again. I confess, that the easy manner in which I got\noff, for a long time, a surprise to me, and I cannot, even now, fully\nexplain the cause.\n\nThe only explanation I can venture to suggest, is the fact, that Covey\nwas, probably, ashamed to have it known and confessed that he had been\nmastered by a boy of sixteen. Mr. Covey enjoyed the unbounded and very\nvaluable reputation, of being a first rate overseer and _Negro breaker_.\nBy means of this reputation, he was able to procure his hands for _very\ntrifling_ compensation, and with very great ease. His interest and\nhis pride mutually suggested the wisdom of passing the matter by, in\nsilence. The story that he had undertaken to whip a lad, and had been\nresisted, was, of itself, sufficient to damage him; for his bearing\nshould, in the estimation of slaveholders, be of that imperial order\nthat should make such an occurrence _impossible_. I judge from these\ncircumstances, that Covey deemed it best to{192} give me the go-by. It\nis, perhaps, not altogether creditable to my natural temper, that, after\nthis conflict with Mr. Covey, I did, at times, purposely aim to provoke\nhim to an attack, by refusing to keep with the other hands in the field,\nbut I could never bully him to another battle. I had made up my mind to\ndo him serious damage, if he ever again attempted to lay violent hands\non me.\n\n           _Hereditary bondmen, know ye not\n           Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow?_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. _New Relations and Duties_\n\nCHANGE OF MASTERS--BENEFITS DERIVED BY THE CHANGE--FAME OF THE FIGHT\nWITH COVEY--RECKLESS UNCONCERN--MY ABHORRENCE OF SLAVERY--ABILITY\nTO READ A CAUSE OF PREJUDICE--THE HOLIDAYS--HOW SPENT--SHARP HIT AT\nSLAVERY--EFFECTS OF HOLIDAYS--A DEVICE OF SLAVERY--DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\nCOVEY AND FREELAND--AN IRRELIGIOUS MASTER PREFERRED TO A RELIGIOUS\nONE--CATALOGUE OF FLOGGABLE OFFENSES--HARD LIFE AT COVEY’S\nUSEFUL--IMPROVED CONDITION NOT FOLLOWED BY CONTENTMENT--CONGENIAL\nSOCIETY AT FREELAND’S--SABBATH SCHOOL INSTITUTED--SECRECY\nNECESSARY--AFFECTIONATE RELATIONS OF TUTOR AND PUPILS--CONFIDENCE\nAND FRIENDSHIP AMONG SLAVES--I DECLINE PUBLISHING PARTICULARS OF\nCONVERSATIONS WITH MY FRIENDS--SLAVERY THE INVITER OF VENGEANCE.\n\n\nMy term of actual service to Mr. Edward Covey ended on Christmas day,\n1834. I gladly left the snakish Covey, although he was now as gentle as\na lamb. My home for the year 1835 was already secured--my next master\nwas already selected. There is always more or less excitement about the\nmatter of changing hands, but I had become somewhat reckless. I cared\nvery little into whose hands I fell--I meant to fight my way. Despite of\nCovey, too, the report got abroad, that I was hard to whip; that I was\nguilty of kicking back; that though generally a good tempered Negro,\nI sometimes “_got the devil in me_.” These sayings were rife in Talbot\ncounty, and they distinguished me among my servile brethren. Slaves,\ngenerally, will fight each other, and die at each other’s hands; but\nthere are few who are not held in awe by a white man. Trained from the\ncradle up, to think and{194} feel that their masters are superior, and\ninvested with a sort of sacredness, there are few who can outgrow or\nrise above the control which that sentiment exercises. I had now got\nfree from it, and the thing was known. One bad sheep will spoil a\nwhole flock. Among the slaves, I was a bad sheep. I hated slavery,\nslaveholders, and all pertaining to them; and I did not fail to inspire\nothers with the same feeling, wherever and whenever opportunity was\npresented. This made me a marked lad among the slaves, and a suspected\none among the slaveholders. A knowledge of my ability to read and write,\ngot pretty widely spread, which was very much against me.\n\nThe days between Christmas day and New Year’s, are allowed the slaves as\nholidays. During these days, all regular work was suspended, and there\nwas nothing to do but to keep fires, and look after the stock. This time\nwas regarded as our own, by the grace of our masters, and we, therefore\nused it, or abused it, as we pleased. Those who had families at a\ndistance, were now expected to visit them, and to spend with them the\nentire week. The younger slaves, or the unmarried ones, were expected to\nsee to the cattle, and attend to incidental duties at home. The holidays\nwere variously spent. The sober, thinking and industrious ones of our\nnumber, would employ themselves in manufacturing corn brooms, mats,\nhorse collars and baskets, and some of these were very well made.\nAnother class spent their time in hunting opossums, coons, rabbits, and\nother game. But the majority spent the holidays in sports, ball playing,\nwrestling, boxing, running foot races, dancing, and drinking whisky; and\nthis latter mode of spending the time was generally most agreeable to\ntheir masters. A slave who would work during the holidays, was thought,\nby his master, undeserving of holidays. Such an one had rejected the\nfavor of his master. There was, in this simple act of continued work, an\naccusation against slaves; and a slave could not help thinking, that if\nhe made three dollars during the holidays, he might make three\nhundred during the year. Not to be drunk during the holidays,{195} was\ndisgraceful; and he was esteemed a lazy and improvident man, who could\nnot afford to drink whisky during Christmas.\n\nThe fiddling, dancing and _“jubilee beating_,” was going on in all\ndirections. This latter performance is strictly southern. It supplies\nthe place of a violin, or of other musical instruments, and is played\nso easily, that almost every farm has its “Juba” beater. The performer\nimprovises as he beats, and sings his merry songs, so ordering the words\nas to have them fall pat with the movement of his hands. Among a mass\nof nonsense and wild frolic, once in a while a sharp hit is given to the\nmeanness of slaveholders. Take the following, for an example:\n\n            _We raise de wheat,\n            Dey gib us de corn;\n            We bake de bread,\n            Dey gib us de cruss;\n            We sif de meal,\n            Dey gib us de huss;\n            We peal de meat,\n            Dey gib us de skin,\n            And dat’s de way\n            Dey takes us in.\n            We skim de pot,\n            Dey gib us the liquor,\n            And say dat’s good enough for nigger.\n                    Walk over! walk over!\n            Tom butter and de fat;\n                    Poor nigger you can’t get over dat;\n                                            Walk over_!\n\n\nThis is not a bad summary of the palpable injustice and fraud of\nslavery, giving--as it does--to the lazy and idle, the comforts which\nGod designed should be given solely to the honest laborer. But to the\nholiday’s.\n\nJudging from my own observation and experience, I believe these holidays\nto be among the most effective means, in the hands of slaveholders, of\nkeeping down the spirit of insurrection among the slaves.\n\nTo enslave men, successfully and safely, it is necessary to{196} have\ntheir minds occupied with thoughts and aspirations short of the liberty\nof which they are deprived. A certain degree of attainable good must be\nkept before them. These holidays serve the purpose of keeping the minds\nof the slaves occupied with prospective pleasure, within the limits\nof slavery. The young man can go wooing; the married man can visit his\nwife; the father and mother can see their children; the industrious and\nmoney loving can make a few dollars; the great wrestler can win laurels;\nthe young people can meet, and enjoy each other’s society; the drunken\nman can get plenty of whisky; and the religious man can hold prayer\nmeetings, preach, pray and exhort during the holidays. Before the\nholidays, these are pleasures in prospect; after the holidays, they\nbecome pleasures of memory, and they serve to keep out thoughts and\nwishes of a more dangerous character. Were slaveholders at once\nto abandon the practice of allowing their slaves these liberties,\nperiodically, and to keep them, the year round, closely confined to the\nnarrow circle of their homes, I doubt not that the south would blaze\nwith insurrections. These holidays are conductors or safety valves to\ncarry off the explosive elements inseparable from the human mind,\nwhen reduced to the condition of slavery. But for these, the rigors of\nbondage would become too severe for endurance, and the slave would\nbe forced up to dangerous desperation. Woe to the slaveholder when\nhe undertakes to hinder or to prevent the operation of these electric\nconductors. A succession of earthquakes would be less destructive,\nthan the insurrectionary fires which would be sure to burst forth in\ndifferent parts of the south, from such interference.\n\nThus, the holidays, became part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrongs\nand inhumanity of slavery. Ostensibly, they are institutions of\nbenevolence, designed to mitigate the rigors of slave life, but,\npractically, they are a fraud, instituted by human selfishness, the\nbetter to secure the ends of injustice and oppression. The slave’s\nhappiness is not the end sought, but, rather, the master’s{197} safety.\nIt is not from a generous unconcern for the slave’s labor that this\ncessation from labor is allowed, but from a prudent regard to the safety\nof the slave system. I am strengthened in this opinion, by the fact,\nthat most slaveholders like to have their slaves spend the holidays in\nsuch a manner as to be of no real benefit to the slaves. It is plain,\nthat everything like rational enjoyment among the slaves, is frowned\nupon; and only those wild and low sports, peculiar to semi-civilized\npeople, are encouraged. All the license allowed, appears to have no\nother object than to disgust the slaves with their temporary freedom,\nand to make them as glad to return to their work, as they were to\nleave it. By plunging them into exhausting depths of drunkenness and\ndissipation, this effect is almost certain to follow. I have known\nslaveholders resort to cunning tricks, with a view of getting their\nslaves deplorably drunk. A usual plan is, to make bets on a slave, that\nhe can drink more whisky than any other; and so to induce a rivalry\namong them, for the mastery in this degradation. The scenes, brought\nabout in this way, were often scandalous and loathsome in the extreme.\nWhole multitudes might be found stretched out in brutal drunkenness, at\nonce helpless and disgusting. Thus, when the slave asks for a few\nhours of virtuous freedom, his cunning master takes advantage of\nhis ignorance, and cheers him with a dose of vicious and revolting\ndissipation, artfully labeled with the name of LIBERTY. We were induced\nto drink, I among the rest, and when the holidays were over, we all\nstaggered up from our filth and wallowing, took a long breath, and went\naway to our various fields of work; feeling, upon the whole, rather glad\nto go from that which our masters artfully deceived us into the belief\nwas freedom, back again to the arms of slavery. It was not what we had\ntaken it to be, nor what it might have been, had it not been abused by\nus. It was about as well to be a slave to _master_, as to be a slave to\n_rum_ and _whisky._\n\nI am the more induced to take this view of the holiday system,{198}\nadopted by slaveholders, from what I know of their treatment of slaves,\nin regard to other things. It is the commonest thing for them to try\nto disgust their slaves with what they do not want them to have, or to\nenjoy. A slave, for instance, likes molasses; he steals some; to cure\nhim of the taste for it, his master, in many cases, will go away to\ntown, and buy a large quantity of the _poorest_ quality, and set it\nbefore his slave, and, with whip in hand, compel him to eat it, until\nthe poor fellow is made to sicken at the very thought of molasses. The\nsame course is often adopted to cure slaves of the disagreeable and\ninconvenient practice of asking for more food, when their allowance\nhas failed them. The same disgusting process works well, too, in other\nthings, but I need not cite them. When a slave is drunk, the slaveholder\nhas no fear that he will plan an insurrection; no fear that he will\nescape to the north. It is the sober, thinking slave who is dangerous,\nand needs the vigilance of his master, to keep him a slave. But, to\nproceed with my narrative.\n\nOn the first of January, 1835, I proceeded from St. Michael’s to Mr.\nWilliam Freeland’s, my new home. Mr. Freeland lived only three miles\nfrom St. Michael’s, on an old worn out farm, which required much labor\nto restore it to anything like a self-supporting establishment.\n\nI was not long in finding Mr. Freeland to be a very different man\nfrom Mr. Covey. Though not rich, Mr. Freeland was what may be called a\nwell-bred southern gentleman, as different from Covey, as a well-trained\nand hardened Negro breaker is from the best specimen of the first\nfamilies of the south. Though Freeland was a slaveholder, and shared\nmany of the vices of his class, he seemed alive to the sentiment of\nhonor. He had some sense of justice, and some feelings of humanity. He\nwas fretful, impulsive and passionate, but I must do him the justice\nto say, he was free from the mean and selfish characteristics which\ndistinguished the creature from which I had now, happily, escaped.\nHe was open, frank, imperative, and practiced no concealments,{199}\ndisdaining to play the spy. In all this, he was the opposite of the\ncrafty Covey.\n\nAmong the many advantages gained in my change from Covey’s to\nFreeland’s--startling as the statement may be--was the fact that\nthe latter gentleman made no profession of religion. I assert _most\nunhesitatingly_, that the religion of the south--as I have observed\nit and proved it--is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes; the\njustifier of the most appalling barbarity; a sanctifier of the most\nhateful frauds; and a secure shelter, under which the darkest, foulest,\ngrossest, and most infernal abominations fester and flourish. Were\nI again to be reduced to the condition of a slave, _next_ to that\ncalamity, I should regard the fact of being the slave of a religious\nslaveholder, the greatest that could befall me. For all slaveholders\nwith whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst. I have\nfound them, almost invariably, the vilest, meanest and basest of\ntheir class. Exceptions there may be, but this is true of religious\nslaveholders, _as a class_. It is not for me to explain the fact. Others\nmay do that; I simply state it as a fact, and leave the theological,\nand psychological inquiry, which it raises, to be decided by others\nmore competent than myself. Religious slaveholders, like religious\npersecutors, are ever extreme in their malice and violence. Very near my\nnew home, on an adjoining farm, there lived the Rev. Daniel Weeden, who\nwas both pious and cruel after the real Covey pattern. Mr. Weeden was\na local preacher of the Protestant Methodist persuasion, and a most\nzealous supporter of the ordinances of religion, generally. This\nWeeden owned a woman called “Ceal,” who was a standing proof of his\nmercilessness. Poor Ceal’s back, always scantily clothed, was kept\nliterally raw, by the lash of this religious man and gospel minister.\nThe most notoriously wicked man--so called in distinction from church\nmembers--could hire hands more easily than this brute. When sent out to\nfind a home, a slave would never enter the gates of the preacher Weeden,\nwhile a sinful sinner needed a hand. Be{200} have ill, or behave well,\nit was the known maxim of Weeden, that it is the duty of a master to use\nthe lash. If, for no other reason, he contended that this was essential\nto remind a slave of his condition, and of his master’s authority. The\ngood slave must be whipped, to be _kept_ good, and the bad slave must be\nwhipped, to be _made_ good. Such was Weeden’s theory, and such was his\npractice. The back of his slave-woman will, in the judgment, be the\nswiftest witness against him.\n\nWhile I am stating particular cases, I might as well immortalize another\nof my neighbors, by calling him by name, and putting him in print.\nHe did not think that a “chiel” was near, “taking notes,” and will,\ndoubtless, feel quite angry at having his character touched off in the\nragged style of a slave’s pen. I beg to introduce the reader to REV.\nRIGBY HOPKINS. Mr. Hopkins resides between Easton and St. Michael’s,\nin Talbot county, Maryland. The severity of this man made him a perfect\nterror to the slaves of his neighborhood. The peculiar feature of his\ngovernment, was, his system of whipping slaves, as he said, _in advance_\nof deserving it. He always managed to have one or two slaves to whip\non Monday morning, so as to start his hands to their work, under the\ninspiration of a new assurance on Monday, that his preaching about\nkindness, mercy, brotherly love, and the like, on Sunday, did not\ninterfere with, or prevent him from establishing his authority, by the\ncowskin. He seemed to wish to assure them, that his tears over poor,\nlost and ruined sinners, and his pity for them, did not reach to the\nblacks who tilled his fields. This saintly Hopkins used to boast, that\nhe was the best hand to manage a Negro in the county. He whipped for the\nsmallest offenses, by way of preventing the commission of large ones.\n\nThe reader might imagine a difficulty in finding faults enough for\nsuch frequent whipping. But this is because you have no idea how easy\na matter it is to offend a man who is on the look-out for offenses. The\nman, unaccustomed to slaveholding, would be astonished to observe how\nmany _foggable_ offenses there are in{201} the slaveholder’s catalogue\nof crimes; and how easy it is to commit any one of them, even when the\nslave least intends it. A slaveholder, bent on finding fault, will hatch\nup a dozen a day, if he chooses to do so, and each one of these shall\nbe of a punishable description. A mere look, word, or motion, a mistake,\naccident, or want of power, are all matters for which a slave may be\nwhipped at any time. Does a slave look dissatisfied with his condition?\nIt is said, that he has the devil in him, and it must be whipped out.\nDoes he answer _loudly_, when spoken to by his master, with an air of\nself-consciousness? Then, must he be taken down a button-hole lower, by\nthe lash, well laid on. Does he forget, and omit to pull off his hat,\nwhen approaching a white person? Then, he must, or may be, whipped for\nhis bad manners. Does he ever venture to vindicate his conduct, when\nharshly and unjustly accused? Then, he is guilty of impudence, one of\nthe greatest crimes in the social catalogue of southern society. To\nallow a slave to escape punishment, who has impudently attempted to\nexculpate himself from unjust charges, preferred against him by some\nwhite person, is to be guilty of great dereliction of duty. Does a slave\never venture to suggest a better way of doing a thing, no matter what?\nHe is, altogether, too officious--wise above what is written--and he\ndeserves, even if he does not get, a flogging for his presumption. Does\nhe, while plowing, break a plow, or while hoeing, break a hoe, or while\nchopping, break an ax? No matter what were the imperfections of the\nimplement broken, or the natural liabilities for breaking, the slave\ncan be whipped for carelessness. The _reverend_ slaveholder could always\nfind something of this sort, to justify him in using the lash several\ntimes during the week. Hopkins--like Covey and Weeden--were shunned by\nslaves who had the privilege (as many had) of finding their own masters\nat the end of each year; and yet, there was not a man in all that\nsection of country, who made a louder profession of religion, than did\nMR. RIGBY HOPKINS.{202}\n\nBut, to continue the thread of my story, through my experience when at\nMr. William Freeland’s.\n\nMy poor, weather-beaten bark now reached smoother water, and gentler\nbreezes. My stormy life at Covey’s had been of service to me. The things\nthat would have seemed very hard, had I gone direct to Mr. Freeland’s,\nfrom the home of Master Thomas, were now (after the hardships at\nCovey’s) “trifles light as air.” I was still a field hand, and had come\nto prefer the severe labor of the field, to the enervating duties of\na house servant. I had become large and strong; and had begun to take\npride in the fact, that I could do as much hard work as some of the\nolder men. There is much rivalry among slaves, at times, as to which can\ndo the most work, and masters generally seek to promote such rivalry.\nBut some of us were too wise to race with each other very long. Such\nracing, we had the sagacity to see, was not likely to pay. We had our\ntimes for measuring each other’s strength, but we knew too much to keep\nup the competition so long as to produce an extraordinary day’s work.\nWe knew that if, by extraordinary exertion, a large quantity of work was\ndone in one day, the fact, becoming known to the master, might lead him\nto require the same amount every day. This thought was enough to bring\nus to a dead halt when over so much excited for the race.\n\nAt Mr. Freeland’s, my condition was every way improved. I was no longer\nthe poor scape-goat that I was when at Covey’s, where every wrong thing\ndone was saddled upon me, and where other slaves were whipped over my\nshoulders. Mr. Freeland was too just a man thus to impose upon me, or\nupon any one else.\n\nIt is quite usual to make one slave the object of especial abuse, and to\nbeat him often, with a view to its effect upon others, rather than with\nany expectation that the slave whipped will be improved by it, but\nthe man with whom I now was, could descend to no such meanness and\nwickedness. Every man here was held individually responsible for his own\nconduct.\n\nThis was a vast improvement on the rule at Covey’s. There, I{203}\nwas the general pack horse. Bill Smith was protected, by a positive\nprohibition made by his rich master, and the command of the rich\nslaveholder is LAW to the poor one; Hughes was favored, because of\nhis relationship to Covey; and the hands hired temporarily, escaped\nflogging, except as they got it over my poor shoulders. Of course, this\ncomparison refers to the time when Covey _could_ whip me.\n\nMr. Freeland, like Mr. Covey, gave his hands enough to eat, but, unlike\nMr. Covey, he gave them time to take their meals; he worked us hard\nduring the day, but gave us the night for rest--another advantage to be\nset to the credit of the sinner, as against that of the saint. We were\nseldom in the field after dark in the evening, or before sunrise in the\nmorning. Our implements of husbandry were of the most improved pattern,\nand much superior to those used at Covey’s.\n\nNothwithstanding the improved condition which was now mine, and the many\nadvantages I had gained by my new home, and my new master, I was still\nrestless and discontented. I was about as hard to please by a master,\nas a master is by slave. The freedom from bodily torture and unceasing\nlabor, had given my mind an increased sensibility, and imparted to it\ngreater activity. I was not yet exactly in right relations. “How be it,\nthat was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and\nafterward that which is spiritual.” When entombed at Covey’s, shrouded\nin darkness and physical wretchedness, temporal wellbeing was the grand\n_desideratum;_ but, temporal wants supplied, the spirit puts in its\nclaims. Beat and cuff your slave, keep him hungry and spiritless, and he\nwill follow the chain of his master like a dog; but, feed and clothe\nhim well--work him moderately--surround him with physical comfort--and\ndreams of freedom intrude. Give him a _bad_ master, and he aspires to a\n_good_ master; give him a good master, and he wishes to become his _own_\nmaster. Such is human nature. You may hurl a man so low, beneath\nthe level of his kind, that he loses all just ideas of his natural\nposition;{204} but elevate him a little, and the clear conception of\nrights arises to life and power, and leads him onward. Thus elevated,\na little, at Freeland’s, the dreams called into being by that good man,\nFather Lawson, when in Baltimore, began to visit me; and shoots from\nthe tree of liberty began to put forth tender buds, and dim hopes of the\nfuture began to dawn.\n\nI found myself in congenial society, at Mr. Freeland’s. There were Henry\nHarris, John Harris, Handy Caldwell, and Sandy Jenkins. [6]\n\nHenry and John were brothers, and belonged to Mr. Freeland. They were\nboth remarkably bright and intelligent, though neither of them could\nread. Now for mischief! I had not been long at Freeland’s before I\nwas up to my old tricks. I early began to address my companions on the\nsubject of education, and the advantages of intelligence over ignorance,\nand, as far as I dared, I tried to show the agency of ignorance in\nkeeping men in slavery. Webster’s spelling book and the _Columbian\nOrator_ were looked into again. As summer came on, and the long Sabbath\ndays stretched themselves over our idleness, I became uneasy, and wanted\na Sabbath school, in which to exercise my gifts, and to impart the\nlittle knowledge of letters which I possessed, to my brother slaves. A\nhouse was hardly necessary in the summer time; I could hold my school\nunder the shade of an old oak tree, as well as any where else. The thing\nwas, to get the scholars, and to have them thoroughly imbued with the\ndesire to learn. Two such boys were quickly secured, in Henry and John,\nand from them the contagion spread. I was not long bringing around\nme twenty or thirty young men, who enrolled themselves, gladly, in my\nSabbath school, and were willing to meet me regularly, under the\ntrees or elsewhere, for the purpose of learning to read. It was{205}\nsurprising with what ease they provided themselves with spelling\nbooks. These were mostly the cast off books of their young masters or\nmistresses. I taught, at first, on our own farm. All were impressed with\nthe necessity of keeping the matter as private as possible, for the fate\nof the St. Michael’s attempt was notorious, and fresh in the minds of\nall. Our pious masters, at St. Michael’s, must not know that a few of\ntheir dusky brothers were learning to read the word of God, lest they\nshould come down upon us with the lash and chain. We might have met to\ndrink whisky, to wrestle, fight, and to do other unseemly things, with\nno fear of interruption from the saints or sinners of St. Michael’s.\n\nBut, to meet for the purpose of improving the mind and heart, by\nlearning to read the sacred scriptures, was esteemed a most dangerous\nnuisance, to be instantly stopped. The slaveholders of St. Michael’s,\nlike slaveholders elsewhere, would always prefer to see the slaves\nengaged in degrading sports, rather than to see them acting like moral\nand accountable beings.\n\nHad any one asked a religious white man, in St. Michael’s, twenty years\nago, the names of three men in that town, whose lives were most after\nthe pattern of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, the first three would\nhave been as follows:\n\n    GARRISON WEST, _Class Leader_.\n    WRIGHT FAIRBANKS, _Class Leader_.\n    THOMAS AULD, _Class Leader_.\n\nAnd yet, these were men who ferociously rushed in upon my Sabbath\nschool, at St. Michael’s, armed with mob-like missiles, and I must say,\nI thought him a Christian, until he took part in bloody by the lash.\nThis same Garrison West was my class leader, and I must say, I thought\nhim a Christian, until he took part in breaking up my school. He led me\nno more after that. The plea for this outrage was then, as it is now and\nat all times--the danger to good order. If the slaves learnt to read,\nthey would learn something else, and something worse. The peace of\nslavery would be disturbed; slave rule would be endangered. I leave the\nreader to{206} characterize a system which is endangered by such causes.\nI do not dispute the soundness of the reasoning. It is perfectly sound;\nand, if slavery be _right_, Sabbath schools for teaching slaves to read\nthe bible are _wrong_, and ought to be put down. These Christian class\nleaders were, to this extent, consistent. They had settled the question,\nthat slavery is _right_, and, by that standard, they determined that\nSabbath schools are wrong. To be sure, they were Protestant, and held to\nthe great Protestant right of every man to _“search the scriptures”_ for\nhimself; but, then, to all general rules, there are _exceptions_. How\nconvenient! What crimes may not be committed under the doctrine of the\nlast remark. But, my dear, class leading Methodist brethren, did not\ncondescend to give me a reason for breaking up the Sabbath school at St.\nMichael’s; it was enough that they had determined upon its destruction.\nI am, however, digressing.\n\nAfter getting the school cleverly into operation, the second time\nholding it in the woods, behind the barn, and in the shade of trees--I\nsucceeded in inducing a free colored man, who lived several miles from\nour house, to permit me to hold my school in a room at his house. He,\nvery kindly, gave me this liberty; but he incurred much peril in doing\nso, for the assemblage was an unlawful one. I shall not mention,\nhere, the name of this man; for it might, even now, subject him to\npersecution, although the offenses were committed more than twenty years\nago. I had, at one time, more than forty scholars, all of the right\nsort; and many of them succeeded in learning to read. I have met several\nslaves from Maryland, who were once my scholars; and who obtained their\nfreedom, I doubt not, partly in consequence of the ideas imparted to\nthem in that school. I have had various employments during my short\nlife; but I look back to _none_ with more satisfaction, than to that\nafforded by my Sunday school. An attachment, deep and lasting, sprung\nup between me and my persecuted pupils, which made parting from them\nintensely grievous; and,{207} when I think that most of these dear souls\nare yet shut up in this abject thralldom, I am overwhelmed with grief.\n\nBesides my Sunday school, I devoted three evenings a week to my fellow\nslaves, during the winter. Let the reader reflect upon the fact, that,\nin this christian country, men and women are hiding from professors of\nreligion, in barns, in the woods and fields, in order to learn to read\nthe _holy bible_. Those dear souls, who came to my Sabbath school, came\n_not_ because it was popular or reputable to attend such a place, for\nthey came under the liability of having forty stripes laid on their\nnaked backs. Every moment they spend in my school, they were under this\nterrible liability; and, in this respect, I was sharer with them. Their\nminds had been cramped and starved by their cruel masters; the light of\neducation had been completely excluded; and their hard earnings had\nbeen taken to educate their master’s children. I felt a delight in\ncircumventing the tyrants, and in blessing the victims of their curses.\n\nThe year at Mr. Freeland’s passed off very smoothly, to outward seeming.\nNot a blow was given me during the whole year. To the credit of Mr.\nFreeland--irreligious though he was--it must be stated, that he was the\nbest master I ever had, until I became my own master, and assumed for\nmyself, as I had a right to do, the responsibility of my own existence\nand the exercise of my own powers. For much of the happiness--or\nabsence of misery--with which I passed this year with Mr. Freeland, I\nam indebted to the genial temper and ardent friendship of my brother\nslaves. They were, every one of them, manly, generous and brave, yes; I\nsay they were brave, and I will add, fine looking. It is seldom the lot\nof mortals to have truer and better friends than were the slaves on this\nfarm. It is not uncommon to charge slaves with great treachery toward\neach other, and to believe them incapable of confiding in each other;\nbut I must say, that I never loved, esteemed, or confided in men, more\nthan I did in these. They were as true as steel, and no band of brothers\ncould have been more{208} loving. There were no mean advantages taken\nof each other, as is sometimes the case where slaves are situated as we\nwere; no tattling; no giving each other bad names to Mr. Freeland; and\nno elevating one at the expense of the other. We never undertook to do\nany thing, of any importance, which was likely to affect each other,\nwithout mutual consultation. We were generally a unit, and moved\ntogether. Thoughts and sentiments were exchanged between us, which might\nwell be called very incendiary, by oppressors and tyrants; and perhaps\nthe time has not even now come, when it is safe to unfold all the flying\nsuggestions which arise in the minds of intelligent slaves. Several of\nmy friends and brothers, if yet alive, are still in some part of\nthe house of bondage; and though twenty years have passed away, the\nsuspicious malice of slavery might punish them for even listening to my\nthoughts.\n\nThe slaveholder, kind or cruel, is a slaveholder still--the every\nhour violator of the just and inalienable rights of man; and he is,\ntherefore, every hour silently whetting the knife of vengeance for his\nown throat. He never lisps a syllable in commendation of the fathers\nof this republic, nor denounces any attempted oppression of himself,\nwithout inviting the knife to his own throat, and asserting the rights\nof rebellion for his own slaves.\n\nThe year is ended, and we are now in the midst of the Christmas\nholidays, which are kept this year as last, according to the general\ndescription previously given.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. _The Run-Away Plot_\n\nNEW YEAR’S THOUGHTS AND MEDITATIONS--AGAIN BOUGHT BY FREELAND--NO\nAMBITION TO BE A SLAVE--KINDNESS NO COMPENSATION FOR SLAVERY--INCIPIENT\nSTEPS TOWARD ESCAPE--CONSIDERATIONS LEADING THERETO--IRRECONCILABLE\nHOSTILITY TO SLAVERY--SOLEMN VOW TAKEN--PLAN DIVULGED TO THE\nSLAVES--_Columbian Orator--_SCHEME GAINS FAVOR, DESPITE PRO-SLAVERY\nPREACHING--DANGER OF DISCOVERY--SKILL OF SLAVEHOLDERS IN READING\nTHE MINDS OF THEIR SLAVES--SUSPICION AND COERCION--HYMNS WITH\nDOUBLE MEANING--VALUE, IN DOLLARS, OF OUR COMPANY--PRELIMINARY\nCONSULTATION--PASS-WORD--CONFLICTS OF HOPE AND FEAR--DIFFICULTIES TO BE\nOVERCOME--IGNORANCE OF GEOGRAPHY--SURVEY OF IMAGINARY DIFFICULTIES--EFFECT\nON OUR MINDS--PATRICK HENRY--SANDY BECOMES A DREAMER--ROUTE TO THE NORTH\nLAID OUT--OBJECTIONS CONSIDERED--FRAUDS PRACTICED ON FREEMEN--PASSES\nWRITTEN--ANXIETIES AS THE TIME DREW NEAR--DREAD OF FAILURE--APPEALS\nTO COMRADES--STRANGE PRESENTIMENT--COINCIDENCE--THE BETRAYAL\nDISCOVERED--THE MANNER OF ARRESTING US--RESISTANCE MADE BY HENRY\nHARRIS--ITS EFFECT--THE UNIQUE SPEECH OF MRS.

The mind naturally occupies itself with the mysteries of life\nin all its phases--the ideal, the real and the actual. Sober people\nlook both ways at the beginning of the year, surveying the errors of the\npast, and providing against possible errors of the future. I, too,\nwas thus exercised. I had little pleasure{210} in retrospect, and the\nprospect was not very brilliant. “Notwithstanding,” thought I, “the many\nresolutions and prayers I have made, in behalf of freedom, I am, this\nfirst day of the year 1836, still a slave, still wandering in the depths\nof spirit-devouring thralldom. My faculties and powers of body and soul\nare not my own, but are the property of a fellow mortal, in no sense\nsuperior to me, except that he has the physical power to compel me to\nbe owned and controlled by him. By the combined physical force of the\ncommunity, I am his slave--a slave for life.” With thoughts like these,\nI was perplexed and chafed; they rendered me gloomy and disconsolate.\nThe anguish of my mind may not be written.\n\nAt the close of the year 1835, Mr. Freeland, my temporary master, had\nbought me of Capt. Thomas Auld, for the year 1836. His promptness in\nsecuring my services, would have been flattering to my vanity, had I\nbeen ambitious to win the reputation of being a valuable slave. Even as\nit was, I felt a slight degree of complacency at the circumstance. It\nshowed he was as well pleased with me as a slave, as I was with him as\na master. I have already intimated my regard for Mr. Freeland, and I may\nsay here, in addressing northern readers--where is no selfish motive for\nspeaking in praise of a slaveholder--that Mr. Freeland was a man of many\nexcellent qualities, and to me quite preferable to any master I ever\nhad.\n\nBut the kindness of the slavemaster only gilds the chain of slavery, and\ndetracts nothing from its weight or power. The thought that men are made\nfor other and better uses than slavery, thrives best under the gentle\ntreatment of a kind master. But the grim visage of slavery can assume\nno smiles which can fascinate the partially enlightened slave, into a\nforgetfulness of his bondage, nor of the desirableness of liberty.\n\nI was not through the first month of this, my second year with the kind\nand gentlemanly Mr. Freeland, before I was earnestly considering and\nadvising plans for gaining that freedom, which,{211} when I was but\na mere child, I had ascertained to be the natural and inborn right of\nevery member of the human family. The desire for this freedom had been\nbenumbed, while I was under the brutalizing dominion of Covey; and\nit had been postponed, and rendered inoperative, by my truly pleasant\nSunday school engagements with my friends, during the year 1835, at Mr.\nFreeland’s. It had, however, never entirely subsided. I hated slavery,\nalways, and the desire for freedom only needed a favorable breeze, to\nfan it into a blaze, at any moment. The thought of only being a creature\nof the _present_ and the _past_, troubled me, and I longed to have a\n_future_--a future with hope in it. To be shut up entirely to the past\nand present, is abhorrent to the human mind; it is to the soul--whose\nlife and happiness is unceasing progress--what the prison is to the\nbody; a blight and mildew, a hell of horrors. The dawning of this,\nanother year, awakened me from my temporary slumber, and roused into\nlife my latent, but long cherished aspirations for freedom. I was now\nnot only ashamed to be contented in slavery, but ashamed to _seem_ to be\ncontented, and in my present favorable condition, under the mild rule\nof Mr. F., I am not sure that some kind reader will not condemn me for\nbeing over ambitious, and greatly wanting in proper humility, when I say\nthe truth, that I now drove from me all thoughts of making the best of\nmy lot, and welcomed only such thoughts as led me away from the house\nof bondage. The intense desires, now felt, _to be free_, quickened by my\npresent favorable circumstances, brought me to the determination to act,\nas well as to think and speak. Accordingly, at the beginning of this\nyear 1836, I took upon me a solemn vow, that the year which had now\ndawned upon me should not close, without witnessing an earnest attempt,\non my part, to gain my liberty. This vow only bound me to make my escape\nindividually; but the year spent with Mr. Freeland had attached me, as\nwith “hooks of steel,” to my brother slaves. The most affectionate and\nconfiding friendship existed between us; and I felt it my duty to give\nthem an opportunity to share in my{212} virtuous determination by\nfrankly disclosing to them my plans and purposes. Toward Henry and John\nHarris, I felt a friendship as strong as one man can feel for another;\nfor I could have died with and for them. To them, therefore, with a\nsuitable degree of caution, I began to disclose my sentiments and plans;\nsounding them, the while on the subject of running away, provided a\ngood chance should offer. I scarcely need tell the reader, that I did my\n_very best_ to imbue the minds of my dear friends with my own views and\nfeelings. Thoroughly awakened, now, and with a definite vow upon me, all\nmy little reading, which had any bearing on the subject of human rights,\nwas rendered available in my communications with my friends. That (to\nme) gem of a book, the _Columbian Orator_, with its eloquent orations\nand spicy dialogues, denouncing oppression and slavery--telling of what\nhad been dared, done and suffered by men, to obtain the inestimable boon\nof liberty--was still fresh in my memory, and whirled into the ranks of\nmy speech with the aptitude of well trained soldiers, going through the\ndrill. The fact is, I here began my public speaking. I canvassed,\nwith Henry and John, the subject of slavery, and dashed against it the\ncondemning brand of God’s eternal justice, which it every hour violates.\nMy fellow servants were neither indifferent, dull, nor inapt. Our\nfeelings were more alike than our opinions. All, however, were ready to\nact, when a feasible plan should be proposed. “Show us _how_ the thing\nis to be done,” said they, “and all is clear.”\n\nWe were all, except Sandy, quite free from slaveholding priestcraft. It\nwas in vain that we had been taught from the pulpit at St. Michael’s,\nthe duty of obedience to our masters; to recognize God as the author of\nour enslavement; to regard running away an offense, alike against God\nand man; to deem our enslavement a merciful and beneficial arrangement;\nto esteem our condition, in this country, a paradise to that from which\nwe had been snatched in Africa; to consider our hard hands and dark\ncolor as God’s mark of displeasure, and as pointing us out as the\nproper{213} subjects of slavery; that the relation of master and slave\nwas one of reciprocal benefits; that our work was not more serviceable\nto our masters, than our master’s thinking was serviceable to us. I\nsay, it was in vain that the pulpit of St. Michael’s had constantly\ninculcated these plausible doctrine. Nature laughed them to scorn. For\nmy own part, I had now become altogether too big for my chains. Father\nLawson’s solemn words, of what I ought to be, and might be, in the\nprovidence of God, had not fallen dead on my soul. I was fast\nverging toward manhood, and the prophecies of my childhood were still\nunfulfilled. The thought, that year after year had passed away, and\nmy resolutions to run away had failed and faded--that I was _still a\nslave_, and a slave, too, with chances for gaining my freedom diminished\nand still diminishing--was not a matter to be slept over easily; nor did\nI easily sleep over it.\n\nBut here came a new trouble. Thoughts and purposes so incendiary as\nthose I now cherished, could not agitate the mind long, without danger\nof making themselves manifest to scrutinizing and unfriendly beholders.\nI had reason to fear that my sable face might prove altogether too\ntransparent for the safe concealment of my hazardous enterprise. Plans\nof greater moment have leaked through stone walls, and revealed their\nprojectors. But, here was no stone wall to hide my purpose. I would\nhave given my poor, tell tale face for the immoveable countenance of\nan Indian, for it was far from being proof against the daily, searching\nglances of those with whom I met.\n\nIt is the interest and business of slaveholders to study human nature,\nwith a view to practical results, and many of them attain astonishing\nproficiency in discerning the thoughts and emotions of slaves. They have\nto deal not with earth, wood, or stone, but with _men;_ and, by every\nregard they have for their safety and prosperity, they must study to\nknow the material on which they are at work. So much intellect as the\nslaveholder has around him, requires watching. Their safety depends upon\ntheir vigilance. Conscious of the injustice and wrong they are every\nhour{214} perpetrating, and knowing what they themselves would do if\nmade the victims of such wrongs, they are looking out for the first\nsigns of the dread retribution of justice. They watch, therefore,\nwith skilled and practiced eyes, and have learned to read, with great\naccuracy, the state of mind and heart of the slaves, through his sable\nface. These uneasy sinners are quick to inquire into the matter,\nwhere the slave is concerned. Unusual sobriety, apparent abstraction,\nsullenness and indifference--indeed, any mood out of the common\nway--afford ground for suspicion and inquiry. Often relying on their\nsuperior position and wisdom, they hector and torture the slave into a\nconfession, by affecting to know the truth of their accusations. “You\nhave got the devil in you,” say they, “and we will whip him out of\nyou.” I have often been put thus to the torture, on bare suspicion. This\nsystem has its disadvantages as well as their opposite. The slave\nis sometimes whipped into the confession of offenses which he never\ncommitted. The reader will see that the good old rule--“a man is to\nbe held innocent until proved to be guilty”--does not hold good on the\nslave plantation. Suspicion and torture are the approved methods of\ngetting at the truth, here. It was necessary for me, therefore, to keep\na watch over my deportment, lest the enemy should get the better of me.\n\nBut with all our caution and studied reserve, I am not sure that Mr.\nFreeland did not suspect that all was not right with us. It _did_ seem\nthat he watched us more narrowly, after the plan of escape had been\nconceived and discussed amongst us. Men seldom see themselves as\nothers see them; and while, to ourselves, everything connected with our\ncontemplated escape appeared concealed, Mr. Freeland may have, with the\npeculiar prescience of a slaveholder, mastered the huge thought which\nwas disturbing our peace in slavery.\n\nI am the more inclined to think that he suspected us, because, prudent\nas we were, as I now look back, I can see that we did many silly things,\nvery well calculated to awaken suspicion. We were,{215} at times,\nremarkably buoyant, singing hymns and making joyous exclamations, almost\nas triumphant in their tone as if we reached a land of freedom and\nsafety. A keen observer might have detected in our repeated singing of\n\n            _O Canaan, sweet Canaan,\n            I am bound for the land of Canaan,_\n\nsomething more than a hope of reaching heaven. We meant to reach the\n_north_--and the north was our Canaan.\n\n            _I thought I heard them say,\n            There were lions in the way,\n            I don’t expect to Star\n                    Much longer here._\n\n            _Run to Jesus--shun the danger--\n             I don’t expect to stay\n                    Much longer here_.\n\nwas a favorite air, and had a double meaning. In the lips of some, it\nmeant the expectation of a speedy summons to a world of spirits; but, in\nthe lips of _our_ company, it simply meant, a speedy pilgrimage toward a\nfree state, and deliverance from all the evils and dangers of slavery.\n\nI had succeeded in winning to my (what slaveholders would call\nwicked) scheme, a company of five young men, the very flower of the\nneighborhood, each one of whom would have commanded one thousand dollars\nin the home market. At New Orleans, they would have brought fifteen\nhundred dollars a piece, and, perhaps, more. The names of our party were\nas follows: Henry Harris; John Harris, brother to Henry; Sandy Jenkins,\nof root memory; Charles Roberts, and Henry Bailey. I was the youngest,\nbut one, of the party. I had, however, the advantage of them all, in\nexperience, and in a knowledge of letters. This gave me great influence\nover them. Perhaps not one of them, left to himself, would have dreamed\nof escape as a possible thing. Not one of them was self-moved in the\nmatter. They all wanted to be free; but the serious thought of running\naway, had not entered into{216} their minds, until I won them to the\nundertaking. They all were tolerably well off--for slaves--and had dim\nhopes of being set free, some day, by their masters. If any one is to\nblame for disturbing the quiet of the slaves and slave-masters of\nthe neighborhood of St. Michael’s, _I am the man_. I claim to be the\ninstigator of the high crime (as the slaveholders regard it) and I kept\nlife in it, until life could be kept in it no longer.\n\nPending the time of our contemplated departure out of our Egypt, we met\noften by night, and on every Sunday. At these meetings we talked the\nmatter over; told our hopes and fears, and the difficulties discovered\nor imagined; and, like men of sense, we counted the cost of the\nenterprise to which we were committing ourselves.\n\nThese meetings must have resembled, on a small scale, the meetings of\nrevolutionary conspirators, in their primary condition. We were plotting\nagainst our (so called) lawful rulers; with this difference that we\nsought our own good, and not the harm of our enemies. We did not seek\nto overthrow them, but to escape from them. As for Mr. Freeland, we\nall liked him, and would have gladly remained with him, _as freeman_.\nLIBERTY was our aim; and we had now come to think that we had a right to\nliberty, against every obstacle even against the lives of our enslavers.\n\nWe had several words, expressive of things, important to us, which we\nunderstood, but which, even if distinctly heard by an outsider,\nwould convey no certain meaning. I have reasons for suppressing these\n_pass-words_, which the reader will easily divine. I hated the secrecy;\nbut where slavery is powerful, and liberty is weak, the latter is driven\nto concealment or to destruction.\n\nThe prospect was not always a bright one. At times, we were almost\ntempted to abandon the enterprise, and to get back to that comparative\npeace of mind, which even a man under the gallows might feel, when all\nhope of escape had vanished. Quiet bondage was felt to be better than\nthe doubts, fears and uncertainties, which now so sadly perplexed and\ndisturbed us.{217}\n\nThe infirmities of humanity, generally, were represented in our little\nband. We were confident, bold and determined, at times; and, again,\ndoubting, timid and wavering; whistling, like the boy in the graveyard,\nto keep away the spirits.\n\nTo look at the map, and observe the proximity of Eastern Shore,\nMaryland, to Delaware and Pennsylvania, it may seem to the reader quite\nabsurd, to regard the proposed escape as a formidable undertaking. But\nto _understand_, some one has said a man must _stand under_. The\nreal distance was great enough, but the imagined distance was, to our\nignorance, even greater. Every slaveholder seeks to impress his slave\nwith a belief in the boundlessness of slave territory, and of his own\nalmost illimitable power. We all had vague and indistinct notions of the\ngeography of the country.\n\nThe distance, however, is not the chief trouble. The nearer are the\nlines of a slave state and the borders of a free one, the greater the\nperil. Hired kidnappers infest these borders. Then, too, we knew that\nmerely reaching a free state did not free us; that, wherever caught,\nwe could be returned to slavery. We could see no spot on this side the\nocean, where we could be free. We had heard of Canada, the real Canaan\nof the American bondmen, simply as a country to which the wild goose and\nthe swan repaired at the end of winter, to escape the heat of summer,\nbut not as the home of man. I knew something of theology, but nothing of\ngeography. I really did not, at that time, know that there was a state\nof New York, or a state of Massachusetts. I had heard of Pennsylvania,\nDelaware and New Jersey, and all the southern states, but was ignorant\nof the free states, generally. New York city was our northern limit, and\nto go there, and be forever harassed with the liability of being hunted\ndown and returned to slavery--with the certainty of being treated ten\ntimes worse than we had ever been treated before was a prospect far from\ndelightful, and it might well cause some hesitation about engaging in\nthe enterprise. The case, sometimes, to our excited visions,{218} stood\nthus: At every gate through which we had to pass, we saw a watchman; at\nevery ferry, a guard; on every bridge, a sentinel; and in every wood, a\npatrol or slave-hunter. We were hemmed in on every side. The good to\nbe sought, and the evil to be shunned, were flung in the balance, and\nweighed against each other. On the one hand, there stood slavery; a\nstern reality, glaring frightfully upon us, with the blood of millions\nin his polluted skirts--terrible to behold--greedily devouring our hard\nearnings and feeding himself upon our flesh. Here was the evil from\nwhich to escape. On the other hand, far away, back in the hazy distance,\nwhere all forms seemed but shadows, under the flickering light of the\nnorth star--behind some craggy hill or snow-covered mountain--stood a\ndoubtful freedom, half frozen, beckoning us to her icy domain. This\nwas the good to be sought. The inequality was as great as that between\ncertainty and uncertainty. This, in itself, was enough to stagger us;\nbut when we came to survey the untrodden road, and conjecture the many\npossible difficulties, we were appalled, and at times, as I have said,\nwere upon the point of giving over the struggle altogether.\n\nThe reader can have little idea of the phantoms of trouble which flit,\nin such circumstances, before the uneducated mind of the slave. Upon\neither side, we saw grim death assuming a variety of horrid shapes. Now,\nit was starvation, causing us, in a strange and friendless land, to eat\nour own flesh. Now, we were contending with the waves (for our journey\nwas in part by water) and were drowned. Now, we were hunted by dogs, and\novertaken and torn to pieces by their merciless fangs. We were stung by\nscorpions--chased by wild beasts--bitten by snakes; and, worst of\nall, after having succeeded in swimming rivers--encountering wild\nbeasts--sleeping in the woods--suffering hunger, cold, heat and\nnakedness--we supposed ourselves to be overtaken by hired kidnappers,\nwho, in the name of the law, and for their thrice accursed reward,\nwould, perchance, fire upon us--kill some, wound others, and capture\nall. This dark picture,{219} drawn by ignorance and fear, at times\ngreatly shook our determination, and not unfrequently caused us to\n\n            _Rather bear those ills we had\n            Than fly to others which we knew not of_.\n\n\nI am not disposed to magnify this circumstance in my experience, and yet\nI think I shall seem to be so disposed, to the reader. No man can tell\nthe intense agony which is felt by the slave, when wavering on the point\nof making his escape. All that he has is at stake; and even that which\nhe has not, is at stake, also. The life which he has, may be lost, and\nthe liberty which he seeks, may not be gained.\n\nPatrick Henry, to a listening senate, thrilled by his magic eloquence,\nand ready to stand by him in his boldest flights, could say, GIVE ME\nLIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH, and this saying was a sublime one, even for\na freeman; but, incomparably more sublime, is the same sentiment, when\n_practically_ asserted by men accustomed to the lash and chain--men\nwhose sensibilities must have become more or less deadened by their\nbondage. With us it was a _doubtful_ liberty, at best, that we sought;\nand a certain, lingering death in the rice swamps and sugar fields,\nif we failed. Life is not lightly regarded by men of sane minds. It is\nprecious, alike to the pauper and to the prince--to the slave, and to\nhis master; and yet, I believe there was not one among us, who would not\nrather have been shot down, than pass away life in hopeless bondage.\n\nIn the progress of our preparations, Sandy, the root man, became\ntroubled. He began to have dreams, and some of them were very\ndistressing. One of these, which happened on a Friday night, was, to\nhim, of great significance; and I am quite ready to confess, that I felt\nsomewhat damped by it myself. He said, “I dreamed, last night, that I\nwas roused from sleep, by strange noises, like the voices of a swarm of\nangry birds, that caused a roar as they passed, which fell upon my ear\nlike a coming gale{220} over the tops of the trees. Looking up to see\nwhat it could mean,” said Sandy, “I saw you, Frederick, in the claws of\na huge bird, surrounded by a large number of birds, of all colors and\nsizes. These were all picking at you, while you, with your arms, seemed\nto be trying to protect your eyes. Passing over me, the birds flew in a\nsouth-westerly direction, and I watched them until they were clean\nout of sight. Now, I saw this as plainly as I now see you; and furder,\nhoney, watch de Friday night dream; dare is sumpon in it, shose you\nborn; dare is, indeed, honey.”\n\nI confess I did not like this dream; but I threw off concern about it,\nby attributing it to the general excitement and perturbation consequent\nupon our contemplated plan of escape. I could not, however, shake off\nits effect at once. I felt that it boded me no good. Sandy was unusually\nemphatic and oracular, and his manner had much to do with the impression\nmade upon me.\n\nThe plan of escape which I recommended, and to which my comrades\nassented, was to take a large canoe, owned by Mr. Hamilton, and, on\nthe Saturday night previous to the Easter holidays, launch out into the\nChesapeake bay, and paddle for its head--a distance of seventy miles\nwith all our might. Our course, on reaching this point, was, to turn the\ncanoe adrift, and bend our steps toward the north star, till we reached\na free state.\n\nThere were several objections to this plan. One was, the danger from\ngales on the bay. In rough weather, the waters of the Chesapeake are\nmuch agitated, and there is danger, in a canoe, of being swamped by the\nwaves. Another objection was, that the canoe would soon be missed; the\nabsent persons would, at once, be suspected of having taken it; and\nwe should be pursued by some of the fast sailing bay craft out of St.\nMichael’s. Then, again, if we reached the head of the bay, and turned\nthe canoe adrift, she might prove a guide to our track, and bring the\nland hunters after us.\n\nThese and other objections were set aside, by the stronger ones which\ncould be urged against every other plan that could then be{221 PASSES\nWRITTEN} suggested. On the water, we had a chance of being regarded as\nfishermen, in the service of a master. On the other hand, by taking\nthe land route, through the counties adjoining Delaware, we should be\nsubjected to all manner of interruptions, and many very disagreeable\nquestions, which might give us serious trouble. Any white man is\nauthorized to stop a man of color, on any road, and examine him, and\narrest him, if he so desires.\n\nBy this arrangement, many abuses (considered such even by slaveholders)\noccur. Cases have been known, where freemen have been called upon to\nshow their free papers, by a pack of ruffians--and, on the presentation\nof the papers, the ruffians have torn them up, and seized their victim,\nand sold him to a life of endless bondage.\n\nThe week before our intended start, I wrote a pass for each of our\nparty, giving them permission to visit Baltimore, during the Easter\nholidays. The pass ran after this manner:\n\n\n     This is to certify, that I, the undersigned, have given the\n     bearer, my servant, John, full liberty to go to Baltimore, to\n     spend the Easter holidays.\n                                                     W.H.\n                     Near St. Michael’s, Talbot county, Maryland\n\n\nAlthough we were not going to Baltimore, and were intending to land\neast of North Point, in the direction where I had seen the Philadelphia\nsteamers go, these passes might be made useful to us in the lower part\nof the bay, while steering toward Baltimore. These were not, however, to\nbe shown by us, until all other answers failed to satisfy the\ninquirer. We were all fully alive to the importance of being calm and\nself-possessed, when accosted, if accosted we should be; and we more\ntimes than one rehearsed to each other how we should behave in the hour\nof trial.\n\nThese were long, tedious days and nights. The suspense was painful, in\nthe extreme. To balance probabilities, where life and liberty hang on\nthe result, requires steady nerves. I panted for action, and was glad\nwhen the day, at the close of which we were to start, dawned upon us.\nSleeping, the night before, was{222} out of the question. I probably\nfelt more deeply than any of my companions, because I was the instigator\nof the movement. The responsibility of the whole enterprise rested on my\nshoulders. The glory of success, and the shame and confusion of failure,\ncould not be matters of indifference to me. Our food was prepared;\nour clothes were packed up; we were all ready to go, and impatient for\nSaturday morning--considering that the last morning of our bondage.\n\nI cannot describe the tempest and tumult of my brain, that morning.\nThe reader will please to bear in mind, that, in a slave state, an\nunsuccessful runaway is not only subjected to cruel torture, and sold\naway to the far south, but he is frequently execrated by the other\nslaves. He is charged with making the condition of the other\nslaves intolerable, by laying them all under the suspicion of their\nmasters--subjecting them to greater vigilance, and imposing greater\nlimitations on their privileges. I dreaded murmurs from this quarter.\nIt is difficult, too, for a slavemaster to believe that slaves escaping\nhave not been aided in their flight by some one of their fellow slaves.\nWhen, therefore, a slave is missing, every slave on the place is closely\nexamined as to his knowledge of the undertaking; and they are sometimes\neven tortured, to make them disclose what they are suspected of knowing\nof such escape.\n\nOur anxiety grew more and more intense, as the time of our intended\ndeparture for the north drew nigh. It was truly felt to be a matter\nof life and death with us; and we fully intended to _fight_ as well as\n_run_, if necessity should occur for that extremity. But the trial hour\nwas not yet to come. It was easy to resolve, but not so easy to act. I\nexpected there might be some drawing back, at the last. It was natural\nthat there should be; therefore, during the intervening time, I lost no\nopportunity to explain away difficulties, to remove doubts, to dispel\nfears, and to inspire all with firmness. It was too late to look back;\nand _now_ was the time to go forward. Like most other men, we had done\nthe talking part of our{223} work, long and well; and the time had come\nto _act_ as if we were in earnest, and meant to be as true in action\nas in words. I did not forget to appeal to the pride of my comrades, by\ntelling them that, if after having solemnly promised to go, as they had\ndone, they now failed to make the attempt, they would, in effect, brand\nthemselves with cowardice, and might as well sit down, fold their arms,\nand acknowledge themselves as fit only to be _slaves_. This detestable\ncharacter, all were unwilling to assume. Every man except Sandy (he,\nmuch to our regret, withdrew) stood firm; and at our last meeting we\npledged ourselves afresh, and in the most solemn manner, that, at the\ntime appointed, we _would_ certainly start on our long journey for a\nfree country. This meeting was in the middle of the week, at the end of\nwhich we were to start.\n\nEarly that morning we went, as usual, to the field, but with hearts that\nbeat quickly and anxiously. Any one intimately acquainted with us, might\nhave seen that all was not well with us, and that some monster lingered\nin our thoughts. Our work that morning was the same as it had been for\nseveral days past--drawing out and spreading manure. While thus engaged,\nI had a sudden presentiment, which flashed upon me like lightning in a\ndark night, revealing to the lonely traveler the gulf before, and the\nenemy behind. I instantly turned to Sandy Jenkins, who was near me, and\nsaid to him, _“Sandy, we are betrayed;_ something has just told me so.”\n I felt as sure of it, as if the officers were there in sight.\nSandy said, “Man, dat is strange; but I feel just as you do.” If my\nmother--then long in her grave--had appeared before me, and told me that\nwe were betrayed, I could not, at that moment, have felt more certain of\nthe fact.\n\nIn a few minutes after this, the long, low and distant notes of the horn\nsummoned us from the field to breakfast. I felt as one may be supposed\nto feel before being led forth to be executed for some great offense. I\nwanted no breakfast; but I went with the other slaves toward the house,\nfor form’s sake. My feelings were{224} not disturbed as to the right of\nrunning away; on that point I had no trouble, whatever. My anxiety arose\nfrom a sense of the consequences of failure.\n\nIn thirty minutes after that vivid presentiment came the apprehended\ncrash. On reaching the house, for breakfast, and glancing my eye toward\nthe lane gate, the worst was at once made known. The lane gate off Mr.\nFreeland’s house, is nearly a half mile from the door, and shaded by the\nheavy wood which bordered the main road. I was, however, able to descry\nfour white men, and two colored men, approaching. The white men were\non horseback, and the colored men were walking behind, and seemed to be\ntied. _“It is all over with us,”_ thought I, _“we are surely betrayed_.”\n I now became composed, or at least comparatively so, and calmly awaited\nthe result. I watched the ill-omened company, till I saw them enter the\ngate. Successful flight was impossible, and I made up my mind to stand,\nand meet the evil, whatever it might be; for I was not without a slight\nhope that things might turn differently from what I at first expected.\nIn a few moments, in came Mr. William Hamilton, riding very rapidly, and\nevidently much excited. He was in the habit of riding very slowly, and\nwas seldom known to gallop his horse. This time, his horse was nearly\nat full speed, causing the dust to roll thick behind him. Mr. Hamilton,\nthough one of the most resolute men in the whole neighborhood, was,\nnevertheless, a remarkably mild spoken man; and, even when greatly\nexcited, his language was cool and circumspect. He came to the door, and\ninquired if Mr. Freeland was in. I told him that Mr. Freeland was at the\nbarn. Off the old gentleman rode, toward the barn, with unwonted speed.\nMary, the cook, was at a loss to know what was the matter, and I did\nnot profess any skill in making her understand. I knew she would have\nunited, as readily as any one, in cursing me for bringing trouble into\nthe family; so I held my peace, leaving matters to develop themselves,\nwithout my assistance. In a few moments, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Freeland\ncame down from the barn to the house; and, just as they{225} made their\nappearance in the front yard, three men (who proved to be constables)\ncame dashing into the lane, on horseback, as if summoned by a sign\nrequiring quick work. A few seconds brought them into the front yard,\nwhere they hastily dismounted, and tied their horses. This done, they\njoined Mr. Freeland and Mr. Hamilton, who were standing a short distance\nfrom the kitchen. A few moments were spent, as if in consulting how to\nproceed, and then the whole party walked up to the kitchen door. There\nwas now no one in the kitchen but myself and John Harris. Henry and\nSandy were yet at the barn. Mr. Freeland came inside the kitchen door,\nand with an agitated voice, called me by name, and told me to come\nforward; that there was some gentlemen who wished to see me. I\nstepped toward them, at the door, and asked what they wanted, when the\nconstables grabbed me, and told me that I had better not resist; that\nI had been in a scrape, or was said to have been in one; that they were\nmerely going to take me where I could be examined; that they were going\nto carry me to St. Michael’s, to have me brought before my master. They\nfurther said, that, in case the evidence against me was not true, I\nshould be acquitted. I was now firmly tied, and completely at the mercy\nof my captors. Resistance was idle. They were five in number, armed\nto the very teeth. When they had secured me, they next turned to John\nHarris, and, in a few moments, succeeded in tying him as firmly as they\nhad already tied me. They next turned toward Henry Harris, who had now\nreturned from the barn. “Cross your hands,” said the constables, to\nHenry. “I won’t” said Henry, in a voice so firm and clear, and in a\nmanner so determined, as for a moment to arrest all proceedings. “Won’t\nyou cross your hands?” said Tom Graham, the constable. “_No I won’t_,”\n said Henry, with increasing emphasis. Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Freeland, and\nthe officers, now came near to Henry. Two of the constables drew out\ntheir shining pistols, and swore by the name of God, that he should\ncross his hands, or they would shoot him down. Each of these hired\nruffians now cocked their pistols,{226} and, with fingers apparently\non the triggers, presented their deadly weapons to the breast of the\nunarmed slave, saying, at the same time, if he did not cross his hands,\nthey would “blow his d--d heart out of him.”\n\n_“Shoot! shoot me!”_ said Henry. “_You can’t kill me but once_.\nShoot!--shoot! and be d--d. _I won’t be tied_.” This, the brave fellow\nsaid in a voice as defiant and heroic in its tone, as was the language\nitself; and, at the moment of saying this, with the pistols at his very\nbreast, he quickly raised his arms, and dashed them from the puny hands\nof his assassins, the weapons flying in opposite directions. Now came\nthe struggle. All hands was now rushed upon the brave fellow, and, after\nbeating him for some time, they succeeded in overpowering and tying him.\nHenry put me to shame; he fought, and fought bravely. John and I had\nmade no resistance. The fact is, I never see much use in fighting,\nunless there is a reasonable probability of whipping somebody. Yet there\nwas something almost providential in the resistance made by the gallant\nHenry. But for that resistance, every soul of us would have been hurried\noff to the far south. Just a moment previous to the trouble with Henry,\nMr. Hamilton _mildly_ said--and this gave me the unmistakable clue to\nthe cause of our arrest--“Perhaps we had now better make a search for\nthose protections, which we understand Frederick has written for himself\nand the rest.” Had these passes been found, they would have been point\nblank proof against us, and would have confirmed all the statements of\nour betrayer. Thanks to the resistance of Henry, the excitement produced\nby the scuffle drew all attention in that direction, and I succeeded\nin flinging my pass, unobserved, into the fire. The confusion attendant\nupon the scuffle, and the apprehension of further trouble, perhaps,\nled our captors to forego, for the present, any search for _“those\nprotections” which Frederick was said to have written for his\ncompanions_; so we were not yet convicted of the purpose to run away;\nand it was evident that there was some doubt, on the part of all,\nwhether we had been guilty of such a purpose.{227}\n\nJust as we were all completely tied, and about ready to start toward St.\nMichael’s, and thence to jail, Mrs. Betsey Freeland (mother to William,\nwho was very much attached--after the southern fashion--to Henry and\nJohn, they having been reared from childhood in her house) came to the\nkitchen door, with her hands full of biscuits--for we had not had time\nto take our breakfast that morning--and divided them between Henry and\nJohn. This done, the lady made the following parting address to me,\nlooking and pointing her bony finger at me. “You devil! you yellow\ndevil! It was you that put it into the heads of Henry and John to run\naway. But for _you_, you _long legged yellow devil_, Henry and John\nwould never have thought of running away.” I gave the lady a look, which\ncalled forth a scream of mingled wrath and terror, as she slammed the\nkitchen door, and went in, leaving me, with the rest, in hands as harsh\nas her own broken voice.\n\nCould the kind reader have been quietly riding along the main road to\nor from Easton, that morning, his eye would have met a painful sight.\nHe would have seen five young men, guilty of no crime, save that of\npreferring _liberty_ to a life of _bondage_, drawn along the public\nhighway--firmly bound together--tramping through dust and heat,\nbare-footed and bare-headed--fastened to three strong horses, whose\nriders were armed to the teeth, with pistols and daggers--on their way\nto prison, like felons, and suffering every possible insult from the\ncrowds of idle, vulgar people, who clustered around, and heartlessly\nmade their failure the occasion for all manner of ribaldry and sport.\nAs I looked upon this crowd of vile persons, and saw myself and friends\nthus assailed and persecuted, I could not help seeing the fulfillment of\nSandy’s dream. I was in the hands of moral vultures, and firmly held\nin their sharp talons, and was hurried away toward Easton, in a\nsouth-easterly direction, amid the jeers of new birds of the same\nfeather, through every neighborhood we passed. It seemed to me (and this\nshows the good understanding between the slaveholders and their allies)\nthat every body we met knew{228} the cause of our arrest, and were out,\nawaiting our passing by, to feast their vindictive eyes on our misery\nand to gloat over our ruin. Some said, _I ought to be hanged_, and\nothers, _I ought to be burnt_, others, I ought to have the _“hide”_\ntaken from my back; while no one gave us a kind word or sympathizing\nlook, except the poor slaves, who were lifting their heavy hoes, and who\ncautiously glanced at us through the post-and-rail fences, behind which\nthey were at work. Our sufferings, that morning, can be more easily\nimagined than described. Our hopes were all blasted, at a blow.\nThe cruel injustice, the victorious crime, and the helplessness of\ninnocence, led me to ask, in my ignorance and weakness “Where now is the\nGod of justice and mercy? And why have these wicked men the power thus\nto trample upon our rights, and to insult our feelings?” And yet, in\nthe next moment, came the consoling thought, _“The day of oppressor\nwill come at last.”_ Of one thing I could be glad--not one of my dear\nfriends, upon whom I had brought this great calamity, either by word\nor look, reproached me for having led them into it. We were a band of\nbrothers, and never dearer to each other than now. The thought which\ngave us the most pain, was the probable separation which would now take\nplace, in case we were sold off to the far south, as we were likely\nto be. While the constables were looking forward, Henry and I, being\nfastened together, could occasionally exchange a word, without being\nobserved by the kidnappers who had us in charge. “What shall I do with\nmy pass?” said Henry. “Eat it with your biscuit,” said I; “it won’t do\nto tear it up.” We were now near St. Michael’s. The direction concerning\nthe passes was passed around, and executed. _“Own nothing!”_ said I.\n_“Own nothing!”_ was passed around and enjoined, and assented to. Our\nconfidence in each other was unshaken; and we were quite resolved to\nsucceed or fail together--as much after the calamity which had befallen\nus, as before.\n\nOn reaching St. Michael’s, we underwent a sort of examination at my\nmaster’s store, and it was evident to my mind, that Master{229} Thomas\nsuspected the truthfulness of the evidence upon which they had acted\nin arresting us; and that he only affected, to some extent, the\npositiveness with which he asserted our guilt. There was nothing said by\nany of our company, which could, in any manner, prejudice our cause; and\nthere was hope, yet, that we should be able to return to our homes--if\nfor nothing else, at least to find out the guilty man or woman who had\nbetrayed us.\n\nTo this end, we all denied that we had been guilty of intended flight.\nMaster Thomas said that the evidence he had of our intention to run\naway, was strong enough to hang us, in a case of murder. “But,” said I,\n“the cases are not equal. If murder were committed, some one must have\ncommitted it--the thing is done! In our case, nothing has been done! We\nhave not run away. Where is the evidence against us? We were quietly\nat our work.” I talked thus, with unusual freedom, to bring out the\nevidence against us, for we all wanted, above all things, to know the\nguilty wretch who had betrayed us, that we might have something tangible\nupon which to pour the execrations. From something which dropped, in the\ncourse of the talk, it appeared that there was but one witness against\nus--and that that witness could not be produced. Master Thomas would not\ntell us _who_ his informant was; but we suspected, and suspected _one_\nperson _only_. Several circumstances seemed to point SANDY out, as\nour betrayer. His entire knowledge of our plans his participation\nin them--his withdrawal from us--his dream, and his simultaneous\npresentiment that we were betrayed--the taking us, and the leaving\nhim--were calculated to turn suspicion toward him; and yet, we could not\nsuspect him. We all loved him too well to think it _possible_ that he\ncould have betrayed us. So we rolled the guilt on other shoulders.\n\nWe were literally dragged, that morning, behind horses, a distance of\nfifteen miles, and placed in the Easton jail. We were glad to reach the\nend of our journey, for our pathway had been the scene of insult and\nmortification. Such is the power of public{230} opinion, that it\nis hard, even for the innocent, to feel the happy consolations of\ninnocence, when they fall under the maledictions of this power. How\ncould we regard ourselves as in the right, when all about us denounced\nus as criminals, and had the power and the disposition to treat us as\nsuch.\n\nIn jail, we were placed under the care of Mr. Joseph Graham, the sheriff\nof the county. Henry, and John, and myself, were placed in one room,\nand Henry Baily and Charles Roberts, in another, by themselves. This\nseparation was intended to deprive us of the advantage of concert, and\nto prevent trouble in jail.\n\nOnce shut up, a new set of tormentors came upon us. A swarm of imps,\nin human shape the slave-traders, deputy slave-traders, and agents of\nslave-traders--that gather in every country town of the state, watching\nfor chances to buy human flesh (as buzzards to eat carrion) flocked in\nupon us, to ascertain if our masters had placed us in jail to be sold.\nSuch a set of debased and villainous creatures, I never saw before,\nand hope never to see again. I felt myself surrounded as by a pack of\n_fiends_, fresh from _perdition_. They laughed, leered, and grinned at\nus; saying, “Ah! boys, we’ve got you, havn’t we? So you were about\nto make your escape? Where were you going to?” After taunting us, and\npeering at us, as long as they liked, they one by one subjected us to\nan examination, with a view to ascertain our value; feeling our arms\nand legs, and shaking us by the shoulders to see if we were sound and\nhealthy; impudently asking us, “how we would like to have them for\nmasters?” To such questions, we were, very much to their annoyance,\nquite dumb, disdaining to answer them. For one, I detested the\nwhisky-bloated gamblers in human flesh; and I believe I was as much\ndetested by them in turn. One fellow told me, “if he had me, he would\ncut the devil out of me pretty quick.”\n\nThese Negro buyers are very offensive to the genteel southern Christian\npublic. They are looked upon, in respectable Maryland society, as\nnecessary, but detestable characters. As a class, they{231} are hardened\nruffians, made such by nature and by occupation. Their ears are made\nquite familiar with the agonizing cry of outraged and woe-smitted\nhumanity. Their eyes are forever open to human misery. They walk amid\ndesecrated affections, insulted virtue, and blasted hopes. They\nhave grown intimate with vice and blood; they gloat over the wildest\nillustrations of their soul-damning and earth-polluting business, and\nare moral pests. Yes; they are a legitimate fruit of slavery; and it is\na puzzle to make out a case of greater villainy for them, than for the\nslaveholders, who make such a class _possible_. They are mere hucksters\nof the surplus slave produce of Maryland and Virginia coarse, cruel, and\nswaggering bullies, whose very breathing is of blasphemy and blood.\n\nAside from these slave-buyers, who infested the prison, from time to\ntime, our quarters were much more comfortable than we had any right to\nexpect they would be. Our allowance of food was small and coarse, but\nour room was the best in the jail--neat and spacious, and with nothing\nabout it necessarily reminding us of being in prison, but its heavy\nlocks and bolts and the black, iron lattice-work at the windows. We\nwere prisoners of state, compared with most slaves who are put into that\nEaston jail. But the place was not one of contentment. Bolts, bars and\ngrated windows are not acceptable to freedom-loving people of any color.\nThe suspense, too, was painful. Every step on the stairway was listened\nto, in the hope that the comer would cast a ray of light on our fate. We\nwould have given the hair off our heads for half a dozen words with one\nof the waiters in Sol. Lowe’s hotel. Such waiters were in the way of\nhearing, at the table, the probable course of things. We could see them\nflitting about in their white jackets in front of this hotel, but could\nspeak to none of them.\n\nSoon after the holidays were over, contrary to all our expectations,\nMessrs. Hamilton and Freeland came up to Easton; not to make a bargain\nwith the “Georgia traders,” nor to send us up to Austin Woldfolk, as is\nusual in the case of run-away salves,{232} but to release Charles, Henry\nHarris, Henry Baily and John Harris, from prison, and this, too, without\nthe infliction of a single blow. I was now left entirely alone in\nprison. The innocent had been taken, and the guilty left. My friends\nwere separated from me, and apparently forever. This circumstance caused\nme more pain than any other incident connected with our capture and\nimprisonment. Thirty-nine lashes on my naked and bleeding back, would\nhave been joyfully borne, in preference to this separation from these,\nthe friends of my youth. And yet, I could not but feel that I was the\nvictim of something like justice. Why should these young men, who were\nled into this scheme by me, suffer as much as the instigator? I felt\nglad that they were leased from prison, and from the dread prospect of a\nlife (or death I should rather say) in the rice swamps. It is due to\nthe noble Henry, to say, that he seemed almost as reluctant to leave the\nprison with me in it, as he was to be tied and dragged to prison. But he\nand the rest knew that we should, in all the likelihoods of the case, be\nseparated, in the event of being sold; and since we were now completely\nin the hands of our owners, we all concluded it would be best to go\npeaceably home.\n\nNot until this last separation, dear reader, had I touched those\nprofounder depths of desolation, which it is the lot of slaves often\nto reach. I was solitary in the world, and alone within the walls of\na stone prison, left to a fate of life-long misery. I had hoped and\nexpected much, for months before, but my hopes and expectations were now\nwithered and blasted. The ever dreaded slave life in Georgia, Louisiana\nand Alabama--from which escape is next to impossible now, in my\nloneliness, stared me in the face. The possibility of ever becoming\nanything but an abject slave, a mere machine in the hands of an owner,\nhad now fled, and it seemed to me it had fled forever. A life of living\ndeath, beset with the innumerable horrors of the cotton field, and the\nsugar plantation, seemed to be my doom. The fiends, who rushed into the\nprison when we were first put there, continued to visit me,{233} and\nto ply me with questions and with their tantalizing remarks. I was\ninsulted, but helpless; keenly alive to the demands of justice and\nliberty, but with no means of asserting them. To talk to those imps\nabout justice and mercy, would have been as absurd as to reason with\nbears and tigers. Lead and steel are the only arguments that they\nunderstand.\n\nAfter remaining in this life of misery and despair about a week, which,\nby the way, seemed a month, Master Thomas, very much to my surprise,\nand greatly to my relief, came to the prison, and took me out, for the\npurpose, as he said, of sending me to Alabama, with a friend of his, who\nwould emancipate me at the end of eight years. I was glad enough to get\nout of prison; but I had no faith in the story that this friend of Capt.\nAuld would emancipate me, at the end of the time indicated. Besides,\nI never had heard of his having a friend in Alabama, and I took the\nannouncement, simply as an easy and comfortable method of shipping me\noff to the far south. There was a little scandal, too, connected with\nthe idea of one Christian selling another to the Georgia traders, while\nit was deemed every way proper for them to sell to others. I thought\nthis friend in Alabama was an invention, to meet this difficulty, for\nMaster Thomas was quite jealous of his Christian reputation, however\nunconcerned he might be about his real Christian character. In these\nremarks, however, it is possible that I do Master Thomas Auld injustice.\nHe certainly did not exhaust his power upon me, in the case, but acted,\nupon the whole, very generously, considering the nature of my offense.\nHe had the power and the provocation to send me, without reserve,\ninto the very everglades of Florida, beyond the remotest hope of\nemancipation; and his refusal to exercise that power, must be set down\nto his credit.\n\nAfter lingering about St. Michael’s a few days, and no friend from\nAlabama making his appearance, to take me there, Master Thomas decided\nto send me back again to Baltimore, to live with his brother Hugh, with\nwhom he was now at peace; possibly he{234} became so by his profession\nof religion, at the camp-meeting in the Bay Side. Master Thomas told me\nthat he wished me to go to Baltimore, and learn a trade; and that, if I\nbehaved myself properly, he would _emancipate me at twenty-five!_ Thanks\nfor this one beam of hope in the future. The promise had but one fault;\nit seemed too good to be true.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. _Apprenticeship Life_\n\nNOTHING LOST BY THE ATTEMPT TO RUN AWAY--COMRADES IN THEIR OLD\nHOMES--REASONS FOR SENDING ME AWAY--RETURN TO BALTIMORE--CONTRAST\nBETWEEN TOMMY AND THAT OF HIS COLORED COMPANION--TRIALS IN GARDINER’S\nSHIP YARD--DESPERATE FIGHT--ITS CAUSES--CONFLICT BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACK\nLABOR--DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTRAGE--COLORED TESTIMONY NOTHING--CONDUCT OF\nMASTER HUGH--SPIRIT OF SLAVERY IN BALTIMORE--MY CONDITION IMPROVES--NEW\nASSOCIATIONS--SLAVEHOLDER’S RIGHT TO TAKE HIS WAGES--HOW TO MAKE A\nCONTENTED SLAVE.\n\n\nWell! dear reader, I am not, as you may have already inferred, a loser\nby the general upstir, described in the foregoing chapter. The little\ndomestic revolution, notwithstanding the sudden snub it got by the\ntreachery of somebody--I dare not say or think who--did not, after all,\nend so disastrously, as when in the iron cage at Easton, I conceived it\nwould. The prospect, from that point, did look about as dark as any that\never cast its gloom over the vision of the anxious, out-looking, human\nspirit. “All is well that ends well.” My affectionate comrades, Henry\nand John Harris, are still with Mr. William Freeland. Charles Roberts\nand Henry Baily are safe at their homes. I have not, therefore, any\nthing to regret on their account. Their masters have mercifully forgiven\nthem, probably on the ground suggested in the spirited little speech of\nMrs. Freeland, made to me just before leaving for the jail--namely: that\nthey had been allured into the wicked scheme of making their escape, by\nme; and that, but for me, they would never have dreamed of a thing so\nshocking! My{236} friends had nothing to regret, either; for while they\nwere watched more closely on account of what had happened, they were,\ndoubtless, treated more kindly than before, and got new assurances that\nthey would be legally emancipated, some day, provided their behavior\nshould make them deserving, from that time forward. Not a blow, as I\nlearned, was struck any one of them. As for Master William Freeland,\ngood, unsuspecting soul, he did not believe that we were intending to\nrun away at all. Having given--as he thought--no occasion to his boys\nto leave him, he could not think it probable that they had entertained a\ndesign so grievous. This, however, was not the view taken of the matter\nby “Mas’ Billy,” as we used to call the soft spoken, but crafty and\nresolute Mr. William Hamilton. He had no doubt that the crime had been\nmeditated; and regarding me as the instigator of it, he frankly told\nMaster Thomas that he must remove me from that neighborhood, or he\nwould shoot me down. He would not have one so dangerous as “Frederick”\n tampering with his slaves. William Hamilton was not a man whose threat\nmight be safely disregarded. I have no doubt that he would have proved\nas good as his word, had the warning given not been promptly taken. He\nwas furious at the thought of such a piece of high-handed _theft_, as we\nwere about to perpetrate the stealing of our own bodies and souls! The\nfeasibility of the plan, too, could the first steps have been taken, was\nmarvelously plain. Besides, this was a _new_ idea, this use of the\nbay. Slaves escaping, until now, had taken to the woods; they had never\ndreamed of profaning and abusing the waters of the noble Chesapeake, by\nmaking them the highway from slavery to freedom. Here was a broad road\nof destruction to slavery, which, before, had been looked upon as a wall\nof security by slaveholders. But Master Billy could not get Mr. Freeland\nto see matters precisely as he did; nor could he get Master Thomas\nso excited as he was himself. The latter--I must say it to his\ncredit--showed much humane feeling in his part of the transaction, and\natoned for much that had been harsh, cruel{237} and unreasonable in his\nformer treatment of me and others. His clemency was quite unusual and\nunlooked for. “Cousin Tom” told me that while I was in jail, Master\nThomas was very unhappy; and that the night before his going up to\nrelease me, he had walked the floor nearly all night, evincing great\ndistress; that very tempting offers had been made to him, by the\nNegro-traders, but he had rejected them all, saying that _money could\nnot tempt him to sell me to the far south_. All this I can easily\nbelieve, for he seemed quite reluctant to send me away, at all. He told\nme that he only consented to do so, because of the very strong prejudice\nagainst me in the neighborhood, and that he feared for my safety if I\nremained there.\n\nThus, after three years spent in the country, roughing it in the field,\nand experiencing all sorts of hardships, I was again permitted to return\nto Baltimore, the very place, of all others, short of a free state,\nwhere I most desired to live. The three years spent in the country, had\nmade some difference in me, and in the household of Master Hugh. “Little\nTommy” was no longer _little_ Tommy; and I was not the slender lad\nwho had left for the Eastern Shore just three years before. The loving\nrelations between me and Mas’ Tommy were broken up. He was no longer\ndependent on me for protection, but felt himself a _man_, with other\nand more suitable associates. In childhood, he scarcely considered me\ninferior to himself certainly, as good as any other boy with whom he\nplayed; but the time had come when his _friend_ must become his _slave_.\nSo we were cold, and we parted. It was a sad thing to me, that, loving\neach other as we had done, we must now take different roads. To him, a\nthousand avenues were open. Education had made him acquainted with\nall the treasures of the world, and liberty had flung open the gates\nthereunto; but I, who had attended him seven years, and had watched over\nhim with the care of a big brother, fighting his battles in the street,\nand shielding him from harm, to an extent which had induced his mother\nto say, “Oh! Tommy is always safe, when he is with{238} Freddy,” must be\nconfined to a single condition. He could grow, and become a MAN; I could\ngrow, though I could _not_ become a man, but must remain, all my life,\na minor--a mere boy. Thomas Auld, Junior, obtained a situation on board\nthe brig “Tweed,” and went to sea. I know not what has become of him; he\ncertainly has my good wishes for his welfare and prosperity. There were\nfew persons to whom I was more sincerely attached than to him, and there\nare few in the world I would be more pleased to meet.\n\nVery soon after I went to Baltimore to live, Master Hugh succeeded in\ngetting me hired to Mr. William Gardiner, an extensive ship builder on\nFell’s Point. I was placed here to learn to calk, a trade of which I\nalready had some knowledge, gained while in Mr. Hugh Auld’s ship-yard,\nwhen he was a master builder. Gardiner’s, however, proved a very\nunfavorable place for the accomplishment of that object. Mr. Gardiner\nwas, that season, engaged in building two large man-of-war vessels,\nprofessedly for the Mexican government. These vessels were to be\nlaunched in the month of July, of that year, and, in failure thereof,\nMr. G. would forfeit a very considerable sum of money. So, when I\nentered the ship-yard, all was hurry and driving. There were in the yard\nabout one hundred men; of these about seventy or eighty were regular\ncarpenters--privileged men. Speaking of my condition here I wrote, years\nago--and I have now no reason to vary the picture as follows:\n\n\nThere was no time to learn any thing. Every man had to do that which he\nknew how to do. In entering the ship-yard, my orders from Mr. Gardiner\nwere, to do whatever the carpenters commanded me to do. This was placing\nme at the beck and call of about seventy-five men. I was to regard all\nthese as masters. Their word was to be my law. My situation was a most\ntrying one. At times I needed a dozen pair of hands. I was called a\ndozen ways in the space of a single minute. Three or four voices would\nstrike my ear at the same moment. It was--“Fred., come help me to cant\nthis timber here.” “Fred., come carry this timber yonder.”--“Fred.,\nbring that roller here.”--“Fred., go get a fresh can of water.”--“Fred.,\ncome help saw off the end of this timber.”--“Fred., go quick and get the\ncrow bar.”--“Fred., hold on the end of this fall.”--“Fred., go to the\nblacksmith’s shop, and get a new punch.”--{239}\n\n“Hurra, Fred.! run and bring me a cold chisel.”--“I say, Fred., bear\na hand, and get up a fire as quick as lightning under that\nsteam-box.”--“Halloo, nigger! come, turn this grindstone.”--“Come, come!\nmove, move! and _bowse_ this timber forward.”--“I say, darkey, blast\nyour eyes, why don’t you heat up some pitch?”--“Halloo! halloo! halloo!”\n (Three voices at the same time.) “Come here!--Go there!--Hold on where\nyou are! D--n you, if you move, I’ll knock your brains out!”\n\n\nSuch, dear reader, is a glance at the school which was mine, during,\nthe first eight months of my stay at Baltimore. At the end of the\neight months, Master Hugh refused longer to allow me to remain with Mr.\nGardiner. The circumstance which led to his taking me away, was a brutal\noutrage, committed upon me by the white apprentices of the ship-yard.\nThe fight was a desperate one, and I came out of it most shockingly\nmangled. I was cut and bruised in sundry places, and my left eye was\nnearly knocked out of its socket. The facts, leading to this barbarous\noutrage upon me, illustrate a phase of slavery destined to become an\nimportant element in the overthrow of the slave system, and I may,\ntherefore state them with some minuteness. That phase is this: _the\nconflict of slavery with the interests of the white mechanics and\nlaborers of the south_. In the country, this conflict is not so\napparent; but, in cities, such as Baltimore, Richmond, New Orleans,\nMobile, &c., it is seen pretty clearly. The slaveholders, with a\ncraftiness peculiar to themselves, by encouraging the enmity of the\npoor, laboring white man against the blacks, succeeds in making the\nsaid white man almost as much a slave as the black slave himself. The\ndifference between the white slave, and the black slave, is this: the\nlatter belongs to _one_ slaveholder, and the former belongs to _all_\nthe slaveholders, collectively. The white slave has taken from him,\nby indirection, what the black slave has taken from him, directly, and\nwithout ceremony. Both are plundered, and by the same plunderers. The\nslave is robbed, by his master, of all his earnings, above what is\nrequired for his bare physical necessities; and the white man is robbed\nby the slave system, of the just results of his labor, because he is\nflung into{240} competition with a class of laborers who work without\nwages. The competition, and its injurious consequences, will, one day,\narray the nonslaveholding white people of the slave states, against the\nslave system, and make them the most effective workers against the great\nevil. At present, the slaveholders blind them to this competition, by\nkeeping alive their prejudice against the slaves, _as men_--not\nagainst them _as slaves_. They appeal to their pride, often denouncing\nemancipation, as tending to place the white man, on an equality with\nNegroes, and, by this means, they succeed in drawing off the minds of\nthe poor whites from the real fact, that, by the rich slave-master,\nthey are already regarded as but a single remove from equality with the\nslave. The impression is cunningly made, that slavery is the only power\nthat can prevent the laboring white man from falling to the level of\nthe slave’s poverty and degradation. To make this enmity deep and broad,\nbetween the slave and the poor white man, the latter is allowed to abuse\nand whip the former, without hinderance. But--as I have suggested--this\nstate of facts prevails _mostly_ in the country. In the city of\nBaltimore, there are not unfrequent murmurs, that educating the slaves\nto be mechanics may, in the end, give slavemasters power to dispense\nwith the services of the poor white man altogether. But, with\ncharacteristic dread of offending the slaveholders, these poor, white\nmechanics in Mr. Gardiner’s ship-yard--instead of applying the natural,\nhonest remedy for the apprehended evil, and objecting at once to work\nthere by the side of slaves--made a cowardly attack upon the free\ncolored mechanics, saying _they_ were eating the bread which should be\neaten by American freemen, and swearing that they would not work with\nthem. The feeling was, _really_, against having their labor brought into\ncompetition with that of the colored people at all; but it was too much\nto strike directly at the interest of the slaveholders; and, therefore\nproving their servility and cowardice they dealt their blows on the\npoor, colored freeman, and aimed to prevent _him_ from serving himself,\nin the evening of life, with the trade{241} with which he had served his\nmaster, during the more vigorous portion of his days. Had they succeeded\nin driving the black freemen out of the ship-yard, they would have\ndetermined also upon the removal of the black slaves. The feeling was\nvery bitter toward all colored people in Baltimore, about this time\n(1836), and they--free and slave suffered all manner of insult and\nwrong.\n\nUntil a very little before I went there, white and black ship carpenters\nworked side by side, in the ship yards of Mr. Gardiner, Mr. Duncan, Mr.\nWalter Price, and Mr. Robb. Nobody seemed to see any impropriety in it.\nTo outward seeming, all hands were well satisfied. Some of the blacks\nwere first rate workmen, and were given jobs requiring highest skill.\nAll at once, however, the white carpenters knocked off, and swore that\nthey would no longer work on the same stage with free Negroes. Taking\nadvantage of the heavy contract resting upon Mr. Gardiner, to have the\nwar vessels for Mexico ready to launch in July, and of the difficulty\nof getting other hands at that season of the year, they swore they would\nnot strike another blow for him, unless he would discharge his free\ncolored workmen.\n\nNow, although this movement did not extend to me, _in form_, it did\nreach me, _in fact_. The spirit which it awakened was one of malice and\nbitterness, toward colored people _generally_, and I suffered with the\nrest, and suffered severely. My fellow apprentices very soon began\nto feel it to be degrading to work with me. They began to put on high\nlooks, and to talk contemptuously and maliciously of _“the Niggers;”_\nsaying, that “they would take the country,” that “they ought to be\nkilled.” Encouraged by the cowardly workmen, who, knowing me to be a\nslave, made no issue with Mr. Gardiner about my being there, these young\nmen did their utmost to make it impossible for me to stay. They seldom\ncalled me to do any thing, without coupling the call with a curse, and\nEdward North, the biggest in every thing, rascality included, ventured\nto strike me, whereupon I picked him up, and threw{242} him into the\ndock. Whenever any of them struck me, I struck back again, regardless\nof consequences. I could manage any of them _singly_, and, while I could\nkeep them from combining, I succeeded very well. In the conflict\nwhich ended my stay at Mr. Gardiner’s, I was beset by four of them at\nonce--Ned North, Ned Hays, Bill Stewart, and Tom Humphreys. Two of them\nwere as large as myself, and they came near killing me, in broad day\nlight. The attack was made suddenly, and simultaneously. One came in\nfront, armed with a brick; there was one at each side, and one behind,\nand they closed up around me. I was struck on all sides; and, while\nI was attending to those in front, I received a blow on my head, from\nbehind, dealt with a heavy hand-spike. I was completely stunned by\nthe blow, and fell, heavily, on the ground, among the timbers. Taking\nadvantage of my fall, they rushed upon me, and began to pound me with\ntheir fists. I let them lay on, for a while, after I came to myself,\nwith a view of gaining strength. They did me little damage, so far;\nbut, finally, getting tired of that sport, I gave a sudden surge, and,\ndespite their weight, I rose to my hands and knees. Just as I did this,\none of their number (I know not which) planted a blow with his boot in\nmy left eye, which, for a time, seemed to have burst my eyeball. When\nthey saw my eye completely closed, my face covered with blood, and I\nstaggering under the stunning blows they had given me, they left me. As\nsoon as I gathered sufficient strength, I picked up the hand-spike,\nand, madly enough, attempted to pursue them; but here the carpenters\ninterfered, and compelled me to give up my frenzied pursuit. It was\nimpossible to stand against so many.\n\nDear reader, you can hardly believe the statement, but it is true, and,\ntherefore, I write it down: not fewer than fifty white men stood by, and\nsaw this brutal and shameless outrage committed, and not a man of them\nall interposed a single word of mercy. There were four against one, and\nthat one’s face was beaten and battered most horribly, and no one said,\n“that is enough;” but some cried out, “Kill him--kill him--kill the d--d\n{243} nigger! knock his brains out--he struck a white person.” I mention\nthis inhuman outcry, to show the character of the men, and the spirit of\nthe times, at Gardiner’s ship yard, and, indeed, in Baltimore generally,\nin 1836. As I look back to this period, I am almost amazed that I was\nnot murdered outright, in that ship yard, so murderous was the spirit\nwhich prevailed there. On two occasions, while there, I came near losing\nmy life. I was driving bolts in the hold, through the keelson, with\nHays. In its course, the bolt bent. Hays cursed me, and said that it was\nmy blow which bent the bolt. I denied this, and charged it upon him. In\na fit of rage he seized an adze, and darted toward me. I met him with a\nmaul, and parried his blow, or I should have then lost my life. A son of\nold Tom Lanman (the latter’s double murder I have elsewhere charged upon\nhim), in the spirit of his miserable father, made an assault upon me,\nbut the blow with his maul missed me. After the united assault of North,\nStewart, Hays and Humphreys, finding that the carpenters were as bitter\ntoward me as the apprentices, and that the latter were probably set\non by the former, I found my only chances for life was in flight. I\nsucceeded in getting away, without an additional blow. To strike a white\nman, was death, by Lynch law, in Gardiner’s ship yard; nor was there\nmuch of any other law toward colored people, at that time, in any other\npart of Maryland. The whole sentiment of Baltimore was murderous.\n\nAfter making my escape from the ship yard, I went straight home, and\nrelated the story of the outrage to Master Hugh Auld; and it is due to\nhim to say, that his conduct--though he was not a religious man--was\nevery way more humane than that of his brother, Thomas, when I went to\nthe latter in a somewhat similar plight, from the hands of _“Brother\nEdward Covey.”_ He listened attentively to my narration of the\ncircumstances leading to the ruffianly outrage, and gave many proofs\nof his strong indignation at what was done. Hugh was a rough, but\nmanly-hearted fellow, and, at this time, his best nature showed itself.\n{244}\n\nThe heart of my once almost over-kind mistress, Sophia, was again melted\nin pity toward me. My puffed-out eye, and my scarred and blood-covered\nface, moved the dear lady to tears. She kindly drew a chair by me, and\nwith friendly, consoling words, she took water, and washed the blood\nfrom my face. No mother’s hand could have been more tender than hers.\nShe bound up my head, and covered my wounded eye with a lean piece of\nfresh beef. It was almost compensation for the murderous assault, and\nmy suffering, that it furnished and occasion for the manifestation, once\nmore, of the orignally(sic) characteristic kindness of my mistress. Her\naffectionate heart was not yet dead, though much hardened by time and by\ncircumstances.\n\nAs for Master Hugh’s part, as I have said, he was furious about it;\nand he gave expression to his fury in the usual forms of speech in that\nlocality. He poured curses on the heads of the whole ship yard\ncompany, and swore that he would have satisfaction for the outrage.\nHis indignation was really strong and healthy; but, unfortunately, it\nresulted from the thought that his rights of property, in my person, had\nnot been respected, more than from any sense of the outrage committed on\nme _as a man_. I inferred as much as this, from the fact that he could,\nhimself, beat and mangle when it suited him to do so. Bent on having\nsatisfaction, as he said, just as soon as I got a little the better\nof my bruises, Master Hugh took me to Esquire Watson’s office, on Bond\nstreet, Fell’s Point, with a view to procuring the arrest of those who\nhad assaulted me. He related the outrage to the magistrate, as I had\nrelated it to him, and seemed to expect that a warrant would, at once,\nbe issued for the arrest of the lawless ruffians.\n\nMr. Watson heard it all, and instead of drawing up his warrant, he\ninquired.--\n\n“Mr. Auld, who saw this assault of which you speak?”\n\n“It was done, sir, in the presence of a ship yard full of hands.”\n\n“Sir,” said Watson, “I am sorry, but I cannot move in this matter except\nupon the oath of white witnesses.”{245}\n\n“But here’s the boy; look at his head and face,” said the excited Master\nHugh; _“they_ show _what_ has been done.”\n\nBut Watson insisted that he was not authorized to do anything, unless\n_white_ witnesses of the transaction would come forward, and testify\nto what had taken place. He could issue no warrant on my word, against\nwhite persons; and, if I had been killed in the presence of a _thousand\nblacks_, their testimony, combined would have been insufficient to\narrest a single murderer. Master Hugh, for once, was compelled to say,\nthat this state of things was _too bad;_ and he left the office of the\nmagistrate, disgusted.\n\nOf course, it was impossible to get any white man to testify against my\nassailants. The carpenters saw what was done; but the actors were but\nthe agents of their malice, and only what the carpenters sanctioned.\nThey had cried, with one accord, _“Kill the nigger!” “Kill the nigger!”_\nEven those who may have pitied me, if any such were among them, lacked\nthe moral courage to come and volunteer their evidence. The slightest\nmanifestation of sympathy or justice toward a person of color, was\ndenounced as abolitionism; and the name of abolitionist, subjected its\nbearer to frightful liabilities. “D--n _abolitionists,”_ and _“Kill the\nniggers,”_ were the watch-words of the foul-mouthed ruffians of those\ndays. Nothing was done, and probably there would not have been any thing\ndone, had I been killed in the affray. The laws and the morals of\nthe Christian city of Baltimore, afforded no protection to the sable\ndenizens of that city.\n\nMaster Hugh, on finding he could get no redress for the cruel wrong,\nwithdrew me from the employment of Mr. Gardiner, and took me into his\nown family, Mrs. Auld kindly taking care of me, and dressing my wounds,\nuntil they were healed, and I was ready to go again to work.\n\nWhile I was on the Eastern Shore, Master Hugh had met with reverses,\nwhich overthrew his business; and he had given up ship building in his\nown yard, on the City Block, and was now acting as foreman of Mr. Walter\nPrice. The best he could now do for me,{246} was to take me into Mr.\nPrice’s yard, and afford me the facilities there, for completing the\ntrade which I had began to learn at Gardiner’s. Here I rapidly became\nexpert in the use of my calking tools; and, in the course of a single\nyear, I was able to command the highest wages paid to journeymen calkers\nin Baltimore.\n\nThe reader will observe that I was now of some pecuniary value to my\nmaster. During the busy season, I was bringing six and seven dollars per\nweek. I have, sometimes, brought him as much as nine dollars a week, for\nthe wages were a dollar and a half per day.\n\nAfter learning to calk, I sought my own employment, made my own\ncontracts, and collected my own earnings; giving Master Hugh no trouble\nin any part of the transactions to which I was a party.\n\nHere, then, were better days for the Eastern Shore _slave_. I was\nnow free from the vexatious assalts(sic) of the apprentices at Mr.\nGardiner’s; and free from the perils of plantation life, and once more\nin a favorable condition to increase my little stock of education, which\nhad been at a dead stand since my removal from Baltimore. I had, on the\nEastern Shore, been only a teacher, when in company with other slaves,\nbut now there were colored persons who could instruct me. Many of\nthe young calkers could read, write and cipher. Some of them had high\nnotions about mental improvement; and the free ones, on Fell’s Point,\norganized what they called the _“East Baltimore Mental Improvement\nSociety.”_ To this society, notwithstanding it was intended that only\nfree persons should attach themselves, I was admitted, and was, several\ntimes, assigned a prominent part in its debates. I owe much to the\nsociety of these young men.\n\nThe reader already knows enough of the _ill_ effects of good treatment\non a slave, to anticipate what was now the case in my improved\ncondition. It was not long before I began to show signs of disquiet with\nslavery, and to look around for means to get out of that condition by\nthe shortest route. I was living among _free_{247} _men;_ and was, in\nall respects, equal to them by nature and by attainments. _Why should\nI be a slave?_ There was _no_ reason why I should be the thrall of any\nman.\n\nBesides, I was now getting--as I have said--a dollar and fifty cents per\nday. I contracted for it, worked for it, earned it, collected it; it\nwas paid to me, and it was _rightfully_ my own; and yet, upon every\nreturning Saturday night, this money--my own hard earnings, every cent\nof it--was demanded of me, and taken from me by Master Hugh. He did not\nearn it; he had no hand in earning it; why, then, should he have it? I\nowed him nothing. He had given me no schooling, and I had received from\nhim only my food and raiment; and for these, my services were supposed\nto pay, from the first. The right to take my earnings, was the right of\nthe robber. He had the power to compel me to give him the fruits of my\nlabor, and this power was his only right in the case. I became more and\nmore dissatisfied with this state of things; and, in so becoming, I only\ngave proof of the same human nature which every reader of this chapter\nin my life--slaveholder, or nonslaveholder--is conscious of possessing.\n\nTo make a contented slave, you must make a thoughtless one. It is\nnecessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as\npossible, to annihilate his power of reason. He must be able to detect\nno inconsistencies in slavery. The man that takes his earnings, must be\nable to convince him that he has a perfect right to do so. It must\nnot depend upon mere force; the slave must know no Higher Law than his\nmaster’s will. The whole relationship must not only demonstrate, to\nhis mind, its necessity, but its absolute rightfulness. If there be one\ncrevice through which a single drop can fall, it will certainly rust off\nthe slave’s chain.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. _My Escape from Slavery_\n\nCLOSING INCIDENTS OF “MY LIFE AS A SLAVE”--REASONS WHY FULL PARTICULARS\nOF THE MANNER OF MY ESCAPE WILL NOT BE GIVEN--CRAFTINESS AND MALICE OF\nSLAVEHOLDERS--SUSPICION OF AIDING A SLAVE’S ESCAPE ABOUT AS DANGEROUS\nAS POSITIVE EVIDENCE--WANT OF WISDOM SHOWN IN PUBLISHING DETAILS OF THE\nESCAPE OF THE FUGITIVES--PUBLISHED ACCOUNTS REACH THE MASTERS, NOT\nTHE SLAVES--SLAVEHOLDERS STIMULATED TO GREATER WATCHFULNESS--MY\nCONDITION--DISCONTENT--SUSPICIONS IMPLIED BY MASTER HUGH’S MANNER, WHEN\nRECEIVING MY WAGES--HIS OCCASIONAL GENEROSITY!--DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY\nOF ESCAPE--EVERY AVENUE GUARDED--PLAN TO OBTAIN MONEY--I AM ALLOWED\nTO HIRE MY TIME--A GLEAM OF HOPE--ATTENDS CAMP-MEETING, WITHOUT\nPERMISSION--ANGER OF MASTER HUGH THEREAT--THE RESULT--MY PLANS OF ESCAPE\nACCELERATED THERBY--THE DAY FOR MY DEPARTURE FIXED--HARASSED BY DOUBTS\nAND FEARS--PAINFUL THOUGHTS OF SEPARATION FROM FRIENDS--THE ATTEMPT\nMADE--ITS SUCCESS.\n\n\nI will now make the kind reader acquainted with the closing incidents of\nmy “Life as a Slave,” having already trenched upon the limit allotted to\nmy “Life as a Freeman.” Before, however, proceeding with this narration,\nit is, perhaps, proper that I should frankly state, in advance, my\nintention to withhold a part of the(sic) connected with my escape from\nslavery. There are reasons for this suppression, which I trust the\nreader will deem altogether valid. It may be easily conceived, that a\nfull and complete statement of all facts pertaining to the flight of a\nbondman, might implicate and embarrass some who may have, wittingly or\nunwittingly, assisted him; and no one can wish me to involve any\nman or{249} woman who has befriended me, even in the liability of\nembarrassment or trouble.\n\nKeen is the scent of the slaveholder; like the fangs of the rattlesnake,\nhis malice retains its poison long; and, although it is now nearly\nseventeen years since I made my escape, it is well to be careful, in\ndealing with the circumstances relating to it. Were I to give but a\nshadowy outline of the process adopted, with characteristic aptitude,\nthe crafty and malicious among the slaveholders might, possibly, hit\nupon the track I pursued, and involve some one in suspicion which, in\na slave state, is about as bad as positive evidence. The colored man,\nthere, must not only shun evil, but shun the very _appearance_ of evil,\nor be condemned as a criminal. A slaveholding community has a peculiar\ntaste for ferreting out offenses against the slave system, justice\nthere being more sensitive in its regard for the peculiar rights of\nthis system, than for any other interest or institution. By stringing\ntogether a train of events and circumstances, even if I were not very\nexplicit, the means of escape might be ascertained, and, possibly,\nthose means be rendered, thereafter, no longer available to the\nliberty-seeking children of bondage I have left behind me. No\nantislavery man can wish me to do anything favoring such results, and\nno slaveholding reader has any right to expect the impartment of such\ninformation.\n\nWhile, therefore, it would afford me pleasure, and perhaps would\nmaterially add to the interest of my story, were I at liberty to gratify\na curiosity which I know to exist in the minds of many, as to the manner\nof my escape, I must deprive myself of this pleasure, and the curious of\nthe gratification, which such a statement of facts would afford. I would\nallow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations that evil minded\nmen might suggest, rather than exculpate myself by explanation, and\nthereby run the hazards of closing the slightest avenue by which a\nbrother in suffering might clear himself of the chains and fetters of\nslavery.\n\nThe practice of publishing every new invention by which a{250} slave is\nknown to have escaped from slavery, has neither wisdom nor necessity\nto sustain it. Had not Henry Box Brown and his friends attracted\nslaveholding attention to the manner of his escape, we might have had a\nthousand _Box Browns_ per annum. The singularly original plan adopted by\nWilliam and Ellen Crafts, perished with the first using, because every\nslaveholder in the land was apprised of it. The _salt water slave_\nwho hung in the guards of a steamer, being washed three days and\nthree nights--like another Jonah--by the waves of the sea, has, by the\npublicity given to the circumstance, set a spy on the guards of every\nsteamer departing from southern ports.\n\nI have never approved of the very public manner, in which some of our\nwestern friends have conducted what _they_ call the _“Under-ground\nRailroad,”_ but which, I think, by their open declarations, has been\nmade, most emphatically, the _“Upper_-ground Railroad.” Its stations are\nfar better known to the slaveholders than to the slaves. I honor those\ngood men and women for their noble daring, in willingly subjecting\nthemselves to persecution, by openly avowing their participation in the\nescape of slaves; nevertheless, the good resulting from such avowals,\nis of a very questionable character. It may kindle an enthusiasm, very\npleasant to inhale; but that is of no practical benefit to themselves,\nnor to the slaves escaping. Nothing is more evident, than that such\ndisclosures are a positive evil to the slaves remaining, and seeking to\nescape. In publishing such accounts, the anti-slavery man addresses\nthe slaveholder, _not the slave;_ he stimulates the former to greater\nwatchfulness, and adds to his facilities for capturing his slave. We owe\nsomething to the slaves, south of Mason and Dixon’s line, as well as to\nthose north of it; and, in discharging the duty of aiding the latter, on\ntheir way to freedom, we should be careful to do nothing which would be\nlikely to hinder the former, in making their escape from slavery.\nSuch is my detestation of slavery, that I would keep the merciless\nslaveholder profoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the\nslave. He{251} should be left to imagine himself surrounded by myriads\nof invisible tormentors, ever ready to snatch, from his infernal grasp,\nhis trembling prey. In pursuing his victim, let him be left to feel his\nway in the dark; let shades of darkness, commensurate with his crime,\nshut every ray of light from his pathway; and let him be made to feel,\nthat, at every step he takes, with the hellish purpose of reducing a\nbrother man to slavery, he is running the frightful risk of having his\nhot brains dashed out by an invisible hand.\n\nBut, enough of this. I will now proceed to the statement of those facts,\nconnected with my escape, for which I am alone responsible, and for\nwhich no one can be made to suffer but myself.\n\nMy condition in the year (1838) of my escape, was, comparatively, a free\nand easy one, so far, at least, as the wants of the physical man were\nconcerned; but the reader will bear in mind, that my troubles from the\nbeginning, have been less physical than mental, and he will thus be\nprepared to find, after what is narrated in the previous chapters, that\nslave life was adding nothing to its charms for me, as I grew older, and\nbecame better acquainted with it. The practice, from week to week, of\nopenly robbing me of all my earnings, kept the nature and character of\nslavery constantly before me. I could be robbed by _indirection_, but\nthis was _too_ open and barefaced to be endured. I could see no reason\nwhy I should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of my honest toil\ninto the purse of any man. The thought itself vexed me, and the manner\nin which Master Hugh received my wages, vexed me more than the original\nwrong. Carefully counting the money and rolling it out, dollar by\ndollar, he would look me in the face, as if he would search my heart as\nwell as my pocket, and reproachfully ask me, “_Is that all_?”--implying\nthat I had, perhaps, kept back part of my wages; or, if not so, the\ndemand was made, possibly, to make me feel, that, after all, I was\nan “unprofitable servant.” Draining me of the last cent of my hard\nearnings, he would, however, occasionally--when I brought{252} home an\nextra large sum--dole out to me a sixpence or a shilling, with a view,\nperhaps, of kindling up my gratitude; but this practice had the opposite\neffect--it was an admission of _my right to the whole sum_. The fact,\nthat he gave me any part of my wages, was proof that he suspected that\nI had a right _to the whole of them_. I always felt uncomfortable, after\nhaving received anything in this way, for I feared that the giving me\na few cents, might, possibly, ease his conscience, and make him feel\nhimself a pretty honorable robber, after all!\n\nHeld to a strict account, and kept under a close watch--the old\nsuspicion of my running away not having been entirely removed--escape\nfrom slavery, even in Baltimore, was very difficult. The railroad from\nBaltimore to Philadelphia was under regulations so stringent, that even\n_free_ colored travelers were almost excluded. They must have _free_\npapers; they must be measured and carefully examined, before they were\nallowed to enter the cars; they only went in the day time, even when so\nexamined. The steamboats were under regulations equally stringent. All\nthe great turnpikes, leading northward, were beset with kidnappers, a\nclass of men who watched the newspapers for advertisements for runaway\nslaves, making their living by the accursed reward of slave hunting.\n\nMy discontent grew upon me, and I was on the look-out for means of\nescape. With money, I could easily have managed the matter, and,\ntherefore, I hit upon the plan of soliciting the privilege of hiring my\ntime. It is quite common, in Baltimore, to allow slaves this privilege,\nand it is the practice, also, in New Orleans. A slave who is considered\ntrustworthy, can, by paying his master a definite sum regularly, at the\nend of each week, dispose of his time as he likes. It so happened that I\nwas not in very good odor, and I was far from being a trustworthy\nslave. Nevertheless, I watched my opportunity when Master Thomas came to\nBaltimore (for I was still his property, Hugh only acted as his agent)\nin the spring of 1838, to purchase his spring supply of goods,{253} and\napplied to him, directly, for the much-coveted privilege of hiring my\ntime. This request Master Thomas unhesitatingly refused to grant; and he\ncharged me, with some sternness, with inventing this stratagem to make\nmy escape. He told me, “I could go _nowhere_ but he could catch me; and,\nin the event of my running away, I might be assured he should spare no\npains in his efforts to recapture me.” He recounted, with a good deal of\neloquence, the many kind offices he had done me, and exhorted me to be\ncontented and obedient. “Lay out no plans for the future,” said he. “If\nyou behave yourself properly, I will take care of you.” Now, kind and\nconsiderate as this offer was, it failed to soothe me into repose. In\nspite of Master Thomas, and, I may say, in spite of myself, also, I\ncontinued to think, and worse still, to think almost exclusively about\nthe injustice and wickedness of slavery. No effort of mine or of his\ncould silence this trouble-giving thought, or change my purpose to run\naway.\n\nAbout two months after applying to Master Thomas for the privilege of\nhiring my time, I applied to Master Hugh for the same liberty,\nsupposing him to be unacquainted with the fact that I had made a similar\napplication to Master Thomas, and had been refused. My boldness in\nmaking this request, fairly astounded him at the first. He gazed at me\nin amazement. But I had many good reasons for pressing the matter; and,\nafter listening to them awhile, he did not absolutely refuse, but told\nme he would think of it. Here, then, was a gleam of hope. Once master of\nmy own time, I felt sure that I could make, over and above my obligation\nto him, a dollar or two every week. Some slaves have made enough, in\nthis way, to purchase their freedom. It is a sharp spur to industry; and\nsome of the most enterprising colored men in Baltimore hire themselves\nin this way. After mature reflection--as I must suppose it was Master\nHugh granted me the privilege in question, on the following terms: I was\nto be allowed all my time; to make all bargains for work; to find my own\nemployment, and to collect my own wages; and,{254} in return for this\nliberty, I was required, or obliged, to pay him three dollars at the\nend of each week, and to board and clothe myself, and buy my own calking\ntools. A failure in any of these particulars would put an end to my\nprivilege. This was a hard bargain. The wear and tear of clothing,\nthe losing and breaking of tools, and the expense of board, made it\nnecessary for me to earn at least six dollars per week, to keep even\nwith the world. All who are acquainted with calking, know how uncertain\nand irregular that employment is. It can be done to advantage only in\ndry weather, for it is useless to put wet oakum into a seam. Rain or\nshine, however, work or no work, at the end of each week the money must\nbe forthcoming.\n\nMaster Hugh seemed to be very much pleased, for a time, with this\narrangement; and well he might be, for it was decidedly in his favor.\nIt relieved him of all anxiety concerning me. His money was sure. He had\narmed my love of liberty with a lash and a driver, far more efficient\nthan any I had before known; and, while he derived all the benefits of\nslaveholding by the arrangement, without its evils, I endured all the\nevils of being a slave, and yet suffered all the care and anxiety of\na responsible freeman. “Nevertheless,” thought I, “it is a valuable\nprivilege another step in my career toward freedom.” It was something\neven to be permitted to stagger under the disadvantages of liberty, and\nI was determined to hold on to the newly gained footing, by all proper\nindustry. I was ready to work by night as well as by day; and being\nin the enjoyment of excellent health, I was able not only to meet my\ncurrent expenses, but also to lay by a small sum at the end of each\nweek. All went on thus, from the month of May till August; then--for\nreasons which will become apparent as I proceed--my much valued liberty\nwas wrested from me.\n\nDuring the week previous to this (to me) calamitous event, I had made\narrangements with a few young friends, to accompany them, on Saturday\nnight, to a camp-meeting, held about twelve miles from Baltimore. On\nthe evening of our intended start for{255} the camp-ground, something\noccurred in the ship yard where I was at work, which detained me\nunusually late, and compelled me either to disappoint my young friends,\nor to neglect carrying my weekly dues to Master Hugh. Knowing that I had\nthe money, and could hand it to him on another day, I decided to go to\ncamp-meeting, and to pay him the three dollars, for the past week, on my\nreturn. Once on the camp-ground, I was induced to remain one day longer\nthan I had intended, when I left home. But, as soon as I returned, I\nwent straight to his house on Fell street, to hand him his (my) money.\nUnhappily, the fatal mistake had been committed. I found him exceedingly\nangry. He exhibited all the signs of apprehension and wrath, which\na slaveholder may be surmised to exhibit on the supposed escape of a\nfavorite slave. “You rascal! I have a great mind to give you a severe\nwhipping. How dare you go out of the city without first asking and\nobtaining my permission?” “Sir,” said I, “I hired my time and paid you\nthe price you asked for it. I did not know that it was any part of the\nbargain that I should ask you when or where I should go.”\n\n“You did not know, you rascal! You are bound to show yourself here every\nSaturday night.” After reflecting, a few moments, he became somewhat\ncooled down; but, evidently greatly troubled, he said, “Now, you\nscoundrel! you have done for yourself; you shall hire your time no\nlonger. The next thing I shall hear of, will be your running away. Bring\nhome your tools and your clothes, at once. I’ll teach you how to go off\nin this way.”\n\nThus ended my partial freedom. I could hire my time no longer; and I\nobeyed my master’s orders at once. The little taste of liberty which I\nhad had--although as the reader will have seen, it was far from being\nunalloyed--by no means enhanced my contentment with slavery. Punished\nthus by Master Hugh, it was now my turn to punish him. “Since,” thought\nI, “you _will_ make a slave of me, I will await your orders in all\nthings;” and, instead of going to look for work on Monday morning, as\nI had{256} formerly done, I remained at home during the entire week,\nwithout the performance of a single stroke of work. Saturday night came,\nand he called upon me, as usual, for my wages. I, of course, told him I\nhad done no work, and had no wages. Here we were at the point of coming\nto blows. His wrath had been accumulating during the whole week; for\nhe evidently saw that I was making no effort to get work, but was most\naggravatingly awaiting his orders, in all things. As I look back to this\nbehavior of mine, I scarcely know what possessed me, thus to trifle with\nthose who had such unlimited power to bless or to blast me. Master Hugh\nraved and swore his determination to _“get hold of me;”_ but, wisely\nfor _him_, and happily for _me_, his wrath only employed those very\nharmless, impalpable missiles, which roll from a limber tongue. In my\ndesperation, I had fully made up my mind to measure strength with Master\nHugh, in case he should undertake to execute his threats. I am glad\nthere was no necessity for this; for resistance to him could not have\nended so happily for me, as it did in the case of Covey. He was not\na man to be safely resisted by a slave; and I freely own, that in my\nconduct toward him, in this instance, there was more folly than wisdom.\nMaster Hugh closed his reproofs, by telling me that, hereafter, I need\ngive myself no uneasiness about getting work; that he “would, himself,\nsee to getting work for me, and enough of it, at that.” This threat I\nconfess had some terror in it; and, on thinking the matter over, during\nthe Sunday, I resolved, not only to save him the trouble of getting me\nwork, but that, upon the third day of September, I would attempt to\nmake my escape from slavery. The refusal to allow me to hire my time,\ntherefore, hastened the period of flight. I had three weeks, now, in\nwhich to prepare for my journey.\n\nOnce resolved, I felt a certain degree of repose, and on Monday, instead\nof waiting for Master Hugh to seek employment for me, I was up by break\nof day, and off to the ship yard of Mr. Butler, on the City Block, near\nthe draw-bridge. I was a favorite{257} with Mr. B., and, young as I was,\nI had served as his foreman on the float stage, at calking. Of course, I\neasily obtained work, and, at the end of the week--which by the way was\nexceedingly fine I brought Master Hugh nearly nine dollars. The effect\nof this mark of returning good sense, on my part, was excellent. He was\nvery much pleased; he took the money, commended me, and told me I might\nhave done the same thing the week before. It is a blessed thing that\nthe tyrant may not always know the thoughts and purposes of his victim.\nMaster Hugh little knew what my plans were. The going to camp-meeting\nwithout asking his permission--the insolent answers made to his\nreproaches--the sulky deportment the week after being deprived of the\nprivilege of hiring my time--had awakened in him the suspicion that I\nmight be cherishing disloyal purposes. My object, therefore, in working\nsteadily, was to remove suspicion, and in this I succeeded admirably. He\nprobably thought I was never better satisfied with my condition, than\nat the very time I was planning my escape. The second week passed, and\nagain I carried him my full week’s wages--_nine dollars;_ and so well\npleased was he, that he gave me TWENTY-FIVE CENTS! and “bade me make\ngood use of it!” I told him I would, for one of the uses to which I\nmeant to put it, was to pay my fare on the underground railroad.\n\nThings without went on as usual; but I was passing through the same\ninternal excitement and anxiety which I had experienced two years and\na half before. The failure, in that instance, was not calculated to\nincrease my confidence in the success of this, my second attempt; and I\nknew that a second failure could not leave me where my first did--I must\neither get to the _far north_, or be sent to the _far south_. Besides\nthe exercise of mind from this state of facts, I had the painful\nsensation of being about to separate from a circle of honest and warm\nhearted friends, in Baltimore. The thought of such a separation, where\nthe hope of ever meeting again is excluded, and where there can be no\ncorrespondence, is very painful. It is my opinion, that thousands would\nescape from{258} slavery who now remain there, but for the strong cords\nof affection that bind them to their families, relatives and friends.\nThe daughter is hindered from escaping, by the love she bears her\nmother, and the father, by the love he bears his children; and so, to\nthe end of the chapter. I had no relations in Baltimore, and I saw no\nprobability of ever living in the neighborhood of sisters and brothers;\nbut the thought of leaving my friends, was among the strongest\nobstacles to my running away. The last two days of the week--Friday and\nSaturday--were spent mostly in collecting my things together, for my\njourney. Having worked four days that week, for my master, I handed him\nsix dollars, on Saturday night. I seldom spent my Sundays at home; and,\nfor fear that something might be discovered in my conduct, I kept up\nmy custom, and absented myself all day. On Monday, the third day of\nSeptember, 1838, in accordance with my resolution, I bade farewell to\nthe city of Baltimore, and to that slavery which had been my abhorrence\nfrom childhood.\n\nHow I got away--in what direction I traveled--whether by land or by\nwater; whether with or without assistance--must, for reasons already\nmentioned, remain unexplained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIFE as a FREEMAN\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. _Liberty Attained_\n\nTRANSITION FROM SLAVERY TO FREEDOM--A WANDERER IN NEW YORK--FEELINGS\nON REACHING THAT CITY--AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE MET--UNFAVORABLE\nIMPRESSIONS--LONELINESS AND INSECURITY--APOLOGY FOR SLAVES WHO RETURN\nTO THEIR MASTERS--COMPELLED TO TELL MY CONDITION--SUCCORED BY A\nSAILOR--DAVID RUGGLES--THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD--MARRIAGE--BAGGAGE TAKEN\nFROM ME--KINDNESS OF NATHAN JOHNSON--MY CHANGE OF NAME--DARK NOTIONS OF\nNORTHERN CIVILIZATION--THE CONTRAST--COLORED PEOPLE IN NEW BEDFORD--AN\nINCIDENT ILLUSTRATING THEIR SPIRIT--A COMMON LABORER--DENIED WORK AT\nMY TRADE--THE FIRST WINTER AT THE NORTH--REPULSE AT THE DOORS OF THE\nCHURCH--SANCTIFIED HATE--THE _Liberator_ AND ITS EDITOR.\n\n\nThere is no necessity for any extended notice of the incidents of this\npart of my life. There is nothing very striking or peculiar about my\ncareer as a freeman, when viewed apart from my life as a slave. The\nrelation subsisting between my early experience and that which I am\nnow about to narrate, is, perhaps, my best apology for adding another\nchapter to this book.\n\nDisappearing from the kind reader, in a flying cloud or balloon\n(pardon the figure), driven by the wind, and knowing not where I should\nland--whether in slavery or in freedom--it is proper that I should\nremove, at once, all anxiety, by frankly making known where I alighted.\nThe flight was a bold and perilous one; but here I am, in the great city\nof New York, safe and sound, without loss of blood or bone. In less than\na week after leaving Baltimore, I was walking amid the hurrying throng,\nand gazing upon the dazzling wonders of Broadway. The dreams{262} of\nmy childhood and the purposes of my manhood were now fulfilled. A free\nstate around me, and a free earth under my feet! What a moment was this\nto me! A whole year was pressed into a single day. A new world burst\nupon my agitated vision. I have often been asked, by kind friends to\nwhom I have told my story, how I felt when first I found myself beyond\nthe limits of slavery; and I must say here, as I have often said to\nthem, there is scarcely anything about which I could not give a more\nsatisfactory answer. It was a moment of joyous excitement, which no\nwords can describe. In a letter to a friend, written soon after reaching\nNew York. I said I felt as one might be supposed to feel, on escaping\nfrom a den of hungry lions. But, in a moment like that, sensations are\ntoo intense and too rapid for words. Anguish and grief, like darkness\nand rain, may be described, but joy and gladness, like the rainbow of\npromise, defy alike the pen and pencil.\n\nFor ten or fifteen years I had been dragging a heavy chain, with a\nhuge block attached to it, cumbering my every motion. I had felt myself\ndoomed to drag this chain and this block through life. All efforts,\nbefore, to separate myself from the hateful encumbrance, had only seemed\nto rivet me the more firmly to it. Baffled and discouraged at times, I\nhad asked myself the question, May not this, after all, be God’s work?\nMay He not, for wise ends, have doomed me to this lot? A contest had\nbeen going on in my mind for years, between the clear consciousness of\nright and the plausible errors of superstition; between the wisdom of\nmanly courage, and the foolish weakness of timidity. The contest was now\nended; the chain was severed; God and right stood vindicated. I was A\nFREEMAN, and the voice of peace and joy thrilled my heart.\n\nFree and joyous, however, as I was, joy was not the only sensation I\nexperienced. It was like the quick blaze, beautiful at the first, but\nwhich subsiding, leaves the building charred and desolate. I was soon\ntaught that I was still in an enemy’s land. A sense of loneliness and\ninsecurity oppressed me sadly. I had{263} been but a few hours in New\nYork, before I was met in the streets by a fugitive slave, well known to\nme, and the information I got from him respecting New York, did nothing\nto lessen my apprehension of danger. The fugitive in question was\n“Allender’s Jake,” in Baltimore; but, said he, I am “WILLIAM DIXON,” in\nNew York! I knew Jake well, and knew when Tolly Allender and Mr. Price\n(for the latter employed Master Hugh as his foreman, in his shipyard on\nFell’s Point) made an attempt to recapture Jake, and failed. Jake told\nme all about his circumstances, and how narrowly he escaped being taken\nback to slavery; that the city was now full of southerners, returning\nfrom the springs; that the black people in New York were not to be\ntrusted; that there were hired men on the lookout for fugitives from\nslavery, and who, for a few dollars, would betray me into the hands of\nthe slave-catchers; that I must trust no man with my secret; that I must\nnot think of going either on the wharves to work, or to a boarding-house\nto board; and, worse still, this same Jake told me it was not in his\npower to help me. He seemed, even while cautioning me, to be fearing\nlest, after all, I might be a party to a second attempt to recapture\nhim. Under the inspiration of this thought, I must suppose it was, he\ngave signs of a wish to get rid of me, and soon left me his whitewash\nbrush in hand--as he said, for his work. He was soon lost to sight among\nthe throng, and I was alone again, an easy prey to the kidnappers, if\nany should happen to be on my track.\n\nNew York, seventeen years ago, was less a place of safety for a runaway\nslave than now, and all know how unsafe it now is, under the new\nfugitive slave bill. I was much troubled. I had very little money enough\nto buy me a few loaves of bread, but not enough to pay board, outside a\nlumber yard. I saw the wisdom of keeping away from the ship yards, for\nif Master Hugh pursued me, he would naturally expect to find me looking\nfor work among the calkers. For a time, every door seemed closed against\nme. A sense of my loneliness and helplessness crept over me,{264}\nand covered me with something bordering on despair. In the midst of\nthousands of my fellowmen, and yet a perfect stranger! In the midst of\nhuman brothers, and yet more fearful of them than of hungry wolves!\nI was without home, without friends, without work, without money, and\nwithout any definite knowledge of which way to go, or where to look for\nsuccor.\n\nSome apology can easily be made for the few slaves who have, after\nmaking good their escape, turned back to slavery, preferring the actual\nrule of their masters, to the life of loneliness, apprehension, hunger,\nand anxiety, which meets them on their first arrival in a free state. It\nis difficult for a freeman to enter into the feelings of such fugitives.\nHe cannot see things in the same light with the slave, because he does\nnot, and cannot, look from the same point from which the slave does.\n“Why do you tremble,” he says to the slave “you are in a free state;”\n but the difficulty is, in realizing that he is in a free state, the\nslave might reply. A freeman cannot understand why the slave-master’s\nshadow is bigger, to the slave, than the might and majesty of a free\nstate; but when he reflects that the slave knows more about the slavery\nof his master than he does of the might and majesty of the free state,\nhe has the explanation. The slave has been all his life learning the\npower of his master--being trained to dread his approach--and only a few\nhours learning the power of the state. The master is to him a stern and\nflinty reality, but the state is little more than a dream. He has been\naccustomed to regard every white man as the friend of his master, and\nevery colored man as more or less under the control of his master’s\nfriends--the white people. It takes stout nerves to stand up, in such\ncircumstances. A man, homeless, shelterless, breadless, friendless, and\nmoneyless, is not in a condition to assume a very proud or joyous tone;\nand in just this condition was I, while wandering about the streets of\nNew York city and lodging, at least one night, among the barrels on one\nof its wharves. I was not only free from slavery, but I was free from\nhome, as well. The reader{265} will easily see that I had something more\nthan the simple fact of being free to think of, in this extremity.\n\nI kept my secret as long as I could, and at last was forced to go in\nsearch of an honest man--a man sufficiently _human_ not to betray me\ninto the hands of slave-catchers. I was not a bad reader of the human\nface, nor long in selecting the right man, when once compelled to\ndisclose the facts of my condition to some one.\n\nI found my man in the person of one who said his name was Stewart. He\nwas a sailor, warm-hearted and generous, and he listened to my story\nwith a brother’s interest. I told him I was running for my freedom--knew\nnot where to go--money almost gone--was hungry--thought it unsafe to go\nthe shipyards for work, and needed a friend. Stewart promptly put me in\nthe way of getting out of my trouble. He took me to his house, and went\nin search of the late David Ruggles, who was then the secretary of the\nNew York Vigilance Committee, and a very active man in all anti-slavery\nworks. Once in the hands of Mr. Ruggles, I was comparatively safe. I was\nhidden with Mr. Ruggles several days. In the meantime, my intended wife,\nAnna, came on from Baltimore--to whom I had written, informing her of my\nsafe arrival at New York--and, in the presence of Mrs. Mitchell and Mr.\nRuggles, we were married, by Rev. James W. C. Pennington.\n\nMr. Ruggles [7] was the first officer on the under-ground railroad with\nwhom I met after reaching the north, and, indeed, the first of whom I\never heard anything. Learning that I was a calker by trade, he promptly\ndecided that New Bedford was the proper{266} place to send me. “Many\nships,” said he, “are there fitted out for the whaling business, and you\nmay there find work at your trade, and make a good living.” Thus, in\none fortnight after my flight from Maryland, I was safe in New Bedford,\nregularly entered upon the exercise of the rights, responsibilities, and\nduties of a freeman.\n\nI may mention a little circumstance which annoyed me on reaching New\nBedford. I had not a cent of money, and lacked two dollars toward paying\nour fare from Newport, and our baggage not very costly--was taken by the\nstage driver, and held until I could raise the money to redeem it. This\ndifficulty was soon surmounted. Mr. Nathan Johnson, to whom we had a\nline from Mr. Ruggles, not only received us kindly and hospitably, but,\non being informed about our baggage, promptly loaned me two dollars with\nwhich to redeem my little property. I shall ever be deeply grateful,\nboth to Mr. and Mrs. Nathan Johnson, for the lively interest they were\npleased to take in me, in this hour of my extremest need. They not only\ngave myself and wife bread and shelter, but taught us how to begin\nto secure those benefits for ourselves. Long may they live, and may\nblessings attend them in this life and in that which is to come!\n\nOnce initiated into the new life of freedom, and assured by Mr. Johnson\nthat New Bedford was a safe place, the comparatively unimportant matter,\nas to what should be my name, came up for considertion(sic). It was\nnecessary to have a name in my new relations. The name given me by\nmy beloved mother was no less pretentious than “Frederick Augustus\nWashington Bailey.” I had, however, before leaving Maryland, dispensed\nwith the _Augustus Washington_, and retained the name _Frederick\nBailey_. Between Baltimore and New Bedford, however, I had several\ndifferent names, the better to avoid being overhauled by the hunters,\nwhich I had good reason to believe would be put on my track. Among\nhonest men an honest man may well be content with one name, and\nto acknowledge it at all times and in all{267} places; but toward\nfugitives, Americans are not honest. When I arrived at New Bedford, my\nname was Johnson; and finding that the Johnson family in New Bedford\nwere already quite numerous--sufficiently so to produce some confusion\nin attempts to distinguish one from another--there was the more reason\nfor making another change in my name. In fact, “Johnson” had been\nassumed by nearly every slave who had arrived in New Bedford from\nMaryland, and this, much to the annoyance of the original “Johnsons”\n (of whom there were many) in that place. Mine host, unwilling to have\nanother of his own name added to the community in this unauthorized way,\nafter I spent a night and a day at his house, gave me my present name.\nHe had been reading the “Lady of the Lake,” and was pleased to regard me\nas a suitable person to wear this, one of Scotland’s many famous names.\nConsidering the noble hospitality and manly character of Nathan Johnson,\nI have felt that he, better than I, illustrated the virtues of the\ngreat Scottish chief. Sure I am, that had any slave-catcher entered his\ndomicile, with a view to molest any one of his household, he would have\nshown himself like him of the “stalwart hand.”\n\nThe reader will be amused at my ignorance, when I tell the notions I had\nof the state of northern wealth, enterprise, and civilization. Of wealth\nand refinement, I supposed the north had none. My _Columbian Orator_,\nwhich was almost my only book, had not done much to enlighten me\nconcerning northern society. The impressions I had received were all\nwide of the truth. New Bedford, especially, took me by surprise, in\nthe solid wealth and grandeur there exhibited. I had formed my notions\nrespecting the social condition of the free states, by what I had seen\nand known of free, white, non-slaveholding people in the slave states.\nRegarding slavery as the basis of wealth, I fancied that no people\ncould become very wealthy without slavery. A free white man, holding\nno slaves, in the country, I had known to be the most ignorant and\npoverty-stricken of men, and the laugh{268} ing stock even of slaves\nthemselves--called generally by them, in derision, _“poor white trash_.”\n Like the non-slaveholders at the south, in holding no slaves, I suppose\nthe northern people like them, also, in poverty and degradation. Judge,\nthen, of my amazement and joy, when I found--as I did find--the very\nlaboring population of New Bedford living in better houses, more\nelegantly furnished--surrounded by more comfort and refinement--than a\nmajority of the slaveholders on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. There was\nmy friend, Mr. Johnson, himself a colored man (who at the south would\nhave been regarded as a proper marketable commodity), who lived in a\nbetter house--dined at a richer board--was the owner of more books--the\nreader of more newspapers--was more conversant with the political and\nsocial condition of this nation and the world--than nine-tenths of\nall the slaveholders of Talbot county, Maryland. Yet Mr. Johnson was a\nworking man, and his hands were hardened by honest toil. Here, then,\nwas something for observation and study. Whence the difference? The\nexplanation was soon furnished, in the superiority of mind over\nsimple brute force. Many pages might be given to the contrast, and in\nexplanation of its causes. But an incident or two will suffice to show\nthe reader as to how the mystery gradually vanished before me.\n\nMy first afternoon, on reaching New Bedford, was spent in visiting the\nwharves and viewing the shipping. The sight of the broad brim and the\nplain, Quaker dress, which met me at every turn, greatly increased my\nsense of freedom and security. “I am among the Quakers,” thought I,\n“and am safe.” Lying at the wharves and riding in the stream, were\nfull-rigged ships of finest model, ready to start on whaling voyages.\nUpon the right and the left, I was walled in by large granite-fronted\nwarehouses, crowded with the good things of this world. On the wharves,\nI saw industry without bustle, labor without noise, and heavy toil\nwithout the whip. There was no loud singing, as in southern ports, where\nships are loading or unloading--no loud cursing or{269} swearing--but\neverything went on as smoothly as the works of a well adjusted machine.\nHow different was all this from the nosily fierce and clumsily absurd\nmanner of labor-life in Baltimore and St. Michael’s! One of the first\nincidents which illustrated the superior mental character of northern\nlabor over that of the south, was the manner of unloading a ship’s\ncargo of oil. In a southern port, twenty or thirty hands would have been\nemployed to do what five or six did here, with the aid of a single ox\nattached to the end of a fall. Main strength, unassisted by skill, is\nslavery’s method of labor. An old ox, worth eighty dollars, was doing,\nin New Bedford, what would have required fifteen thousand dollars worth\nof human bones and muscles to have performed in a southern port. I found\nthat everything was done here with a scrupulous regard to economy,\nboth in regard to men and things, time and strength. The maid servant,\ninstead of spending at least a tenth part of her time in bringing and\ncarrying water, as in Baltimore, had the pump at her elbow. The wood was\ndry, and snugly piled away for winter. Woodhouses, in-door pumps, sinks,\ndrains, self-shutting gates, washing machines, pounding barrels, were\nall new things, and told me that I was among a thoughtful and sensible\npeople. To the ship-repairing dock I went, and saw the same wise\nprudence. The carpenters struck where they aimed, and the calkers wasted\nno blows in idle flourishes of the mallet. I learned that men went from\nNew Bedford to Baltimore, and bought old ships, and brought them here\nto repair, and made them better and more valuable than they ever were\nbefore. Men talked here of going whaling on a four _years’_ voyage with\nmore coolness than sailors where I came from talked of going a four\n_months’_ voyage.\n\nI now find that I could have landed in no part of the United States,\nwhere I should have found a more striking and gratifying contrast to the\ncondition of the free people of color in Baltimore, than I found here in\nNew Bedford. No colored man is really free in a slaveholding state.\nHe wears the badge of bondage while{270} nominally free, and is often\nsubjected to hardships to which the slave is a stranger; but here in New\nBedford, it was my good fortune to see a pretty near approach to freedom\non the part of the colored people. I was taken all aback when Mr.\nJohnson--who lost no time in making me acquainted with the fact--told me\nthat there was nothing in the constitution of Massachusetts to prevent a\ncolored man from holding any office in the state. There, in New Bedford,\nthe black man’s children--although anti-slavery was then far from\npopular--went to school side by side with the white children, and\napparently without objection from any quarter. To make me at home,\nMr. Johnson assured me that no slaveholder could take a slave from\nNew Bedford; that there were men there who would lay down their\nlives, before such an outrage could be perpetrated. The colored people\nthemselves were of the best metal, and would fight for liberty to the\ndeath.\n\nSoon after my arrival in New Bedford, I was told the following story,\nwhich was said to illustrate the spirit of the colored people in that\ngoodly town: A colored man and a fugitive slave happened to have a\nlittle quarrel, and the former was heard to threaten the latter with\ninforming his master of his whereabouts. As soon as this threat became\nknown, a notice was read from the desk of what was then the only colored\nchurch in the place, stating that business of importance was to be then\nand there transacted. Special measures had been taken to secure\nthe attendance of the would-be Judas, and had proved successful.\nAccordingly, at the hour appointed, the people came, and the betrayer\nalso. All the usual formalities of public meetings were scrupulously\ngone through, even to the offering prayer for Divine direction in the\nduties of the occasion. The president himself performed this part of\nthe ceremony, and I was told that he was unusually fervent. Yet, at\nthe close of his prayer, the old man (one of the numerous family of\nJohnsons) rose from his knees, deliberately surveyed his audience, and\nthen said, in a tone of solemn resolution, _“Well, friends, we have got\nhim here, and I would now_{271} _recommend that you young men should\njust take him outside the door and kill him.”_ With this, a large body\nof the congregation, who well understood the business they had come\nthere to transact, made a rush at the villain, and doubtless would have\nkilled him, had he not availed himself of an open sash, and made good\nhis escape. He has never shown his head in New Bedford since that time.\nThis little incident is perfectly characteristic of the spirit of the\ncolored people in New Bedford. A slave could not be taken from that town\nseventeen years ago, any more than he could be so taken away now. The\nreason is, that the colored people in that city are educated up to the\npoint of fighting for their freedom, as well as speaking for it.\n\nOnce assured of my safety in New Bedford, I put on the habiliments of a\ncommon laborer, and went on the wharf in search of work. I had no notion\nof living on the honest and generous sympathy of my colored brother,\nJohnson, or that of the abolitionists. My cry was like that of Hood’s\nlaborer, “Oh! only give me work.” Happily for me, I was not long in\nsearching. I found employment, the third day after my arrival in New\nBedford, in stowing a sloop with a load of oil for the New York market.\nIt was new, hard, and dirty work, even for a calker, but I went at\nit with a glad heart and a willing hand. I was now my own master--a\ntremendous fact--and the rapturous excitement with which I seized the\njob, may not easily be understood, except by some one with an experience\nlike mine. The thoughts--“I can work! I can work for a living; I am not\nafraid of work; I have no Master Hugh to rob me of my earnings”--placed\nme in a state of independence, beyond seeking friendship or support\nof any man. That day’s work I considered the real starting point of\nsomething like a new existence. Having finished this job and got my pay\nfor the same, I went next in pursuit of a job at calking. It so happened\nthat Mr. Rodney French, late mayor of the city of New Bedford, had a\nship fitting out for sea, and to which there was a large job of calking\nand coppering to be done. I applied to that{272} noblehearted man for\nemployment, and he promptly told me to go to work; but going on the\nfloat-stage for the purpose, I was informed that every white man would\nleave the ship if I struck a blow upon her. “Well, well,” thought\nI, “this is a hardship, but yet not a very serious one for me.” The\ndifference between the wages of a calker and that of a common day\nlaborer, was an hundred per cent in favor of the former; but then I was\nfree, and free to work, though not at my trade. I now prepared myself\nto do anything which came to hand in the way of turning an honest penny;\nsawed wood--dug cellars--shoveled coal--swept chimneys with Uncle Lucas\nDebuty--rolled oil casks on the wharves--helped to load and unload\nvessels--worked in Ricketson’s candle works--in Richmond’s brass\nfoundery, and elsewhere; and thus supported myself and family for three\nyears.\n\nThe first winter was unusually severe, in consequence of the high prices\nof food; but even during that winter we probably suffered less than many\nwho had been free all their lives. During the hardest of the winter, I\nhired out for nine dolars(sic) a month; and out of this rented two rooms\nfor nine dollars per quarter, and supplied my wife--who was unable\nto work--with food and some necessary articles of furniture. We were\nclosely pinched to bring our wants within our means; but the jail stood\nover the way, and I had a wholesome dread of the consequences of running\nin debt. This winter past, and I was up with the times--got plenty of\nwork--got well paid for it--and felt that I had not done a foolish thing\nto leave Master Hugh and Master Thomas. I was now living in a new\nworld, and was wide awake to its advantages. I early began to attend the\nmeetings of the colored people of New Bedford, and to take part in them.\nI was somewhat amazed to see colored men drawing up resolutions and\noffering them for consideration. Several colored young men of New\nBedford, at that period, gave promise of great usefulness. They were\neducated, and possessed what seemed to me, at the time, very superior\ntalents. Some of them have been cut down by death, and{273} others have\nremoved to different parts of the world, and some remain there now, and\njustify, in their present activities, my early impressions of them.\n\nAmong my first concerns on reaching New Bedford, was to become united\nwith the church, for I had never given up, in reality, my religious\nfaith. I had become lukewarm and in a backslidden state, but I was still\nconvinced that it was my duty to join the Methodist church. I was not\nthen aware of the powerful influence of that religious body in favor\nof the enslavement of my race, nor did I see how the northern churches\ncould be responsible for the conduct of southern churches; neither did\nI fully understand how it could be my duty to remain separate from the\nchurch, because bad men were connected with it. The slaveholding church,\nwith its Coveys, Weedens, Aulds, and Hopkins, I could see through at\nonce, but I could not see how Elm Street church, in New Bedford, could\nbe regarded as sanctioning the Christianity of these characters in the\nchurch at St. Michael’s. I therefore resolved to join the Methodist\nchurch in New Bedford, and to enjoy the spiritual advantage of public\nworship. The minister of the Elm Street Methodist church, was the Rev.\nMr. Bonney; and although I was not allowed a seat in the body of\nthe house, and was proscribed on account of my color, regarding this\nproscription simply as an accommodation of the uncoverted congregation\nwho had not yet been won to Christ and his brotherhood, I was willing\nthus to be proscribed, lest sinners should be driven away form the\nsaving power of the gospel. Once converted, I thought they would be\nsure to treat me as a man and a brother. “Surely,” thought I, “these\nChristian people have none of this feeling against color. They, at\nleast, have renounced this unholy feeling.” Judge, then, dear reader, of\nmy astonishment and mortification, when I found, as soon I did find, all\nmy charitable assumptions at fault.\n\nAn opportunity was soon afforded me for ascertaining the exact position\nof Elm Street church on that subject. I had a chance of seeing the\nreligious part of the congregation by themselves; and{274} although\nthey disowned, in effect, their black brothers and sisters, before the\nworld, I did think that where none but the saints were assembled, and\nno offense could be given to the wicked, and the gospel could not be\n“blamed,” they would certainly recognize us as children of the same\nFather, and heirs of the same salvation, on equal terms with themselves.\n\nThe occasion to which I refer, was the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper,\nthat most sacred and most solemn of all the ordinances of the Christian\nchurch. Mr. Bonney had preached a very solemn and searching discourse,\nwhich really proved him to be acquainted with the inmost secerts(sic)\nof the human heart. At the close of his discourse, the congregation\nwas dismissed, and the church remained to partake of the sacrament. I\nremained to see, as I thought, this holy sacrament celebrated in the\nspirit of its great Founder.\n\nThere were only about a half dozen colored members attached to the Elm\nStreet church, at this time. After the congregation was dismissed,\nthese descended from the gallery, and took a seat against the wall most\ndistant from the altar. Brother Bonney was very animated, and sung very\nsweetly, “Salvation ‘tis a joyful sound,” and soon began to administer\nthe sacrament. I was anxious to observe the bearing of the colored\nmembers, and the result was most humiliating. During the whole ceremony,\nthey looked like sheep without a shepherd. The white members went\nforward to the altar by the bench full; and when it was evident that\nall the whites had been served with the bread and wine, Brother\nBonney--pious Brother Bonney--after a long pause, as if inquiring\nwhether all the whites members had been served, and fully assuring\nhimself on that important point, then raised his voice to an unnatural\npitch, and looking to the corner where his black sheep seemed penned,\nbeckoned with his hand, exclaiming, “Come forward, colored friends! come\nforward! You, too, have an interest in the blood of Christ. God is no\nrespecter of persons. Come forward, and take this holy sacrament\nto your{275} comfort.” The colored members poor, slavish souls went\nforward, as invited. I went out, and have never been in that church\nsince, although I honestly went there with a view to joining that body.\nI found it impossible to respect the religious profession of any who\nwere under the dominion of this wicked prejudice, and I could not,\ntherefore, feel that in joining them, I was joining a Christian church,\nat all. I tried other churches in New Bedford, with the same result, and\nfinally, I attached myself to a small body of colored Methodists, known\nas the Zion Methodists. Favored with the affection and confidence of the\nmembers of this humble communion, I was soon made a classleader and a\nlocal preacher among them. Many seasons of peace and joy I experienced\namong them, the remembrance of which is still precious, although I could\nnot see it to be my duty to remain with that body, when I found that it\nconsented to the same spirit which held my brethren in chains.\n\nIn four or five months after reaching New Bedford, there came a young\nman to me, with a copy of the _Liberator_, the paper edited by WILLIAM\nLLOYD GARRISON, and published by ISAAC KNAPP, and asked me to subscribe\nfor it. I told him I had but just escaped from slavery, and was of\ncourse very poor, and remarked further, that I was unable to pay for it\nthen; the agent, however, very willingly took me as a subscriber, and\nappeared to be much pleased with securing my name to his list. From this\ntime I was brought in contact with the mind of William Lloyd Garrison.\nHis paper took its place with me next to the bible.\n\nThe _Liberator_ was a paper after my own heart. It detested slavery\nexposed hypocrisy and wickedness in high places--made no truce with\nthe traffickers in the bodies and souls of men; it preached human\nbrotherhood, denounced oppression, and, with all the solemnity of God’s\nword, demanded the complete emancipation of my race. I not only liked--I\n_loved_ this paper, and its editor. He seemed a match for all the\noponents(sic) of emancipation, whether they spoke in the name of the\nlaw, or the gospel.{276} His words were few, full of holy fire, and\nstraight to the point. Learning to love him, through his paper, I was\nprepared to be pleased with his presence. Something of a hero worshiper,\nby nature, here was one, on first sight, to excite my love and\nreverence.\n\nSeventeen years ago, few men possessed a more heavenly countenance than\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, and few men evinced a more genuine or a more\nexalted piety. The bible was his text book--held sacred, as the word of\nthe Eternal Father--sinless perfection--complete submission to insults\nand injuries--literal obedience to the injunction, if smitten on one\nside to turn the other also. Not only was Sunday a Sabbath, but all\ndays were Sabbaths, and to be kept holy. All sectarism false and\nmischievous--the regenerated, throughout the world, members of one body,\nand the HEAD Christ Jesus. Prejudice against color was rebellion against\nGod. Of all men beneath the sky, the slaves, because most neglected and\ndespised, were nearest and dearest to his great heart. Those ministers\nwho defended slavery from the bible, were of their “father the devil”;\nand those churches which fellowshiped slaveholders as Christians, were\nsynagogues of Satan, and our nation was a nation of liars. Never loud or\nnoisy--calm and serene as a summer sky, and as pure. “You are the man,\nthe Moses, raised up by God, to deliver his modern Israel from bondage,”\n was the spontaneous feeling of my heart, as I sat away back in the\nhall and listened to his mighty words; mighty in truth--mighty in their\nsimple earnestness.\n\nI had not long been a reader of the _Liberator_, and listener to its\neditor, before I got a clear apprehension of the principles of the\nanti-slavery movement. I had already the spirit of the movement, and\nonly needed to understand its principles and measures. These I got\nfrom the _Liberator_, and from those who believed in that paper. My\nacquaintance with the movement increased my hope for the ultimate\nfreedom of my race, and I united with it from a sense of delight, as\nwell as duty.{277}\n\nEvery week the _Liberator_ came, and every week I made myself master\nof its contents. All the anti-slavery meetings held in New Bedford I\npromptly attended, my heart burning at every true utterance against\nthe slave system, and every rebuke of its friends and supporters. Thus\npassed the first three years of my residence in New Bedford. I had not\nthen dreamed of the posibility(sic) of my becoming a public advocate\nof the cause so deeply imbedded in my heart. It was enough for me to\nlisten--to receive and applaud the great words of others, and only\nwhisper in private, among the white laborers on the wharves, and\nelsewhere, the truths which burned in my breast.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. _Introduced to the Abolitionists_\n\nFIRST SPEECH AT NANTUCKET--MUCH SENSATION--EXTRAORDINARY SPEECH OF\nMR. GARRISON--AUTHOR BECOMES A PUBLIC LECTURER--FOURTEEN YEARS\nEXPERIENCE--YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM--A BRAND NEW FACT--MATTER OF MY AUTHOR’S\nSPEECH--COULD NOT FOLLOW THE PROGRAMME--FUGITIVE SLAVESHIP DOUBTED--TO\nSETTLE ALL DOUBT I WRITE MY EXPERIENCE OF SLAVERY--DANGER OF RECAPTURE\nINCREASED.\n\n\nIn the summer of 1841, a grand anti-slavery convention was held in\nNantucket, under the auspices of Mr. Garrison and his friends. Until\nnow, I had taken no holiday since my escape from slavery. Having\nworked very hard that spring and summer, in Richmond’s brass\nfoundery--sometimes working all night as well as all day--and needing a\nday or two of rest, I attended this convention, never supposing that I\nshould take part in the proceedings. Indeed, I was not aware that any\none connected with the convention even so much as knew my name. I\nwas, however, quite mistaken. Mr. William C. Coffin, a prominent\nabolitionst(sic) in those days of trial, had heard me speaking to\nmy colored friends, in the little school house on Second street, New\nBedford, where we worshiped. He sought me out in the crowd, and invited\nme to say a few words to the convention. Thus sought out, and thus\ninvited, I was induced to speak out the feelings inspired by the\noccasion, and the fresh recollection of the scenes through which I had\npassed as a slave. My speech on this occasion is about the only one I\never made, of which I do not remember a single connected sentence. It\nwas{279 EXTRAORDINARY SPEECH OF MR. GARRISON} with the utmost difficulty\nthat I could stand erect, or that I could command and articulate two\nwords without hesitation and stammering. I trembled in every limb. I\nam not sure that my embarrassment was not the most effective part of\nmy speech, if speech it could be called. At any rate, this is about the\nonly part of my performance that I now distinctly remember. But excited\nand convulsed as I was, the audience, though remarkably quiet before,\nbecame as much excited as myself. Mr. Garrison followed me, taking me\nas his text; and now, whether I had made an eloquent speech in behalf of\nfreedom or not, his was one never to be forgotten by those who heard it.\nThose who had heard Mr. Garrison oftenest, and had known him longest,\nwere astonished. It was an effort of unequaled power, sweeping down,\nlike a very tornado, every opposing barrier, whether of sentiment or\nopinion. For a moment, he possessed that almost fabulous inspiration,\noften referred to but seldom attained, in which a public meeting\nis transformed, as it were, into a single individuality--the orator\nwielding a thousand heads and hearts at once, and by the simple majesty\nof his all controlling thought, converting his hearers into the express\nimage of his own soul. That night there were at least one thousand\nGarrisonians in Nantucket! A(sic) the close of this great meeting, I\nwas duly waited on by Mr. John A. Collins--then the general agent of\nthe Massachusetts anti-slavery society--and urgently solicited by him\nto become an agent of that society, and to publicly advocate its\nanti-slavery principles. I was reluctant to take the proffered position.\nI had not been quite three years from slavery--was honestly distrustful\nof my ability--wished to be excused; publicity exposed me to discovery\nand arrest by my master; and other objections came up, but Mr. Collins\nwas not to be put off, and I finally consented to go out for three\nmonths, for I supposed that I should have got to the end of my story and\nmy usefulness, in that length of time.\n\nHere opened upon me a new life a life for which I had had no\npreparation. I was a “graduate from the peculiar institution,oath of white witnesses”{280} Mr.\nCollins used to say, when introducing me, _“with my diploma written\non my back!”_ The three years of my freedom had been spent in the\nhard school of adversity. My hands had been furnished by nature with\nsomething like a solid leather coating, and I had bravely marked out for\nmyself a life of rough labor, suited to the hardness of my hands, as a\nmeans of supporting myself and rearing my children.\n\nNow what shall I say of this fourteen years’ experience as a public\nadvocate of the cause of my enslaved brothers and sisters? The time\nis but as a speck, yet large enough to justify a pause for\nretrospection--and a pause it must only be.\n\nYoung, ardent, and hopeful, I entered upon this new life in the full\ngush of unsuspecting enthusiasm. The cause was good; the men engaged in\nit were good; the means to attain its triumph, good; Heaven’s blessing\nmust attend all, and freedom must soon be given to the pining millions\nunder a ruthless bondage. My whole heart went with the holy cause, and\nmy most fervent prayer to the Almighty Disposer of the hearts of men,\nwere continually offered for its early triumph. “Who or what,” thought\nI, “can withstand a cause so good, so holy, so indescribably glorious.\nThe God of Israel is with us. The might of the Eternal is on our side.\nNow let but the truth be spoken, and a nation will start forth at\nthe sound!” In this enthusiastic spirit, I dropped into the ranks of\nfreedom’s friends, and went forth to the battle. For a time I was\nmade to forget that my skin was dark and my hair crisped. For a time I\nregretted that I could not have shared the hardships and dangers endured\nby the earlier workers for the slave’s release. I soon, however, found\nthat my enthusiasm had been extravagant; that hardships and dangers were\nnot yet passed; and that the life now before me, had shadows as well as\nsunbeams.\n\nAmong the first duties assigned me, on entering the ranks, was to\ntravel, in company with Mr. George Foster, to secure subscribers to\nthe _Anti-slavery Standard_ and the _Liberator_. With{281 MATTER OF\nTHE SPEECH} him I traveled and lectured through the eastern counties\nof Massachusetts. Much interest was awakened--large meetings assembled.\nMany came, no doubt, from curiosity to hear what a Negro\ncould say in his own cause. I was generally introduced as a\n_“chattel”--_a_“thing”_--a piece of southern _“property”_--the chairman\nassuring the audience that _it_ could speak. Fugitive slaves, at that\ntime, were not so plentiful as now; and as a fugitive slave lecturer, I\nhad the advantage of being a _“brand new fact”_--the first one out. Up\nto that time, a colored man was deemed a fool who confessed himself\na runaway slave, not only because of the danger to which he exposed\nhimself of being retaken, but because it was a confession of a very\n_low_ origin! Some of my colored friends in New Bedford thought very\nbadly of my wisdom for thus exposing and degrading myself. The only\nprecaution I took, at the beginning, to prevent Master Thomas from\nknowing where I was, and what I was about, was the withholding my former\nname, my master’s name, and the name of the state and county from which\nI came. During the first three or four months, my speeches were almost\nexclusively made up of narrations of my own personal experience as a\nslave. “Let us have the facts,” said the people. So also said Friend\nGeorge Foster, who always wished to pin me down to my simple\nnarrative. “Give us the facts,” said Collins, “we will take care of the\nphilosophy.” Just here arose some embarrassment. It was impossible for\nme to repeat the same old story month after month, and to keep up my\ninterest in it. It was new to the people, it is true, but it was an old\nstory to me; and to go through with it night after night, was a task\naltogether too mechanical for my nature. “Tell your story, Frederick,”\n would whisper my then revered friend, William Lloyd Garrison, as I\nstepped upon the platform. I could not always obey, for I was now\nreading and thinking. New views of the subject were presented to my\nmind. It did not entirely satisfy me to _narrate_ wrongs; I felt like\n_denouncing_ them. I could not always curb my moral indignation{282}\nfor the perpetrators of slaveholding villainy, long enough for a\ncircumstantial statement of the facts which I felt almost everybody must\nknow. Besides, I was growing, and needed room. “People won’t believe\nyou ever was a slave, Frederick, if you keep on this way,” said Friend\nFoster. “Be yourself,” said Collins, “and tell your story.” It was said\nto me, “Better have a _little_ of the plantation manner of speech than\nnot; ‘tis not best that you seem too learned.” These excellent friends\nwere actuated by the best of motives, and were not altogether wrong in\ntheir advice; and still I must speak just the word that seemed to _me_\nthe word to be spoken _by_ me.\n\nAt last the apprehended trouble came. People doubted if I had ever been\na slave. They said I did not talk like a slave, look like a slave, nor\nact like a slave, and that they believed I had never been south of\nMason and Dixon’s line. “He don’t tell us where he came from--what his\nmaster’s name was--how he got away--nor the story of his experience.\nBesides, he is educated, and is, in this, a contradiction of all the\nfacts we have concerning the ignorance of the slaves.” Thus, I was in\na pretty fair way to be denounced as an impostor. The committee of the\nMassachusetts anti-slavery society knew all the facts in my case, and\nagreed with me in the prudence of keeping them private. They, therefore,\nnever doubted my being a genuine fugitive; but going down the aisles\nof the churches in which I spoke, and hearing the free spoken Yankees\nsaying, repeatedly, _“He’s never been a slave, I’ll warrant ye_,” I\nresolved to dispel all doubt, at no distant day, by such a revelation of\nfacts as could not be made by any other than a genuine fugitive.\n\nIn a little less than four years, therefore, after becoming a public\nlecturer, I was induced to write out the leading facts connected with my\nexperience in slavery, giving names of persons, places, and dates--thus\nputting it in the power of any who doubted, to ascertain the truth or\nfalsehood of my story of being a fugitive slave. This statement soon\nbecame known in Maryland,{283} and I had reason to believe that an\neffort would be made to recapture me.\n\nIt is not probable that any open attempt to secure me as a slave could\nhave succeeded, further than the obtainment, by my master, of the money\nvalue of my bones and sinews. Fortunately for me, in the four years of\nmy labors in the abolition cause, I had gained many friends, who would\nhave suffered themselves to be taxed to almost any extent to save me\nfrom slavery. It was felt that I had committed the double offense\nof running away, and exposing the secrets and crimes of slavery\nand slaveholders. There was a double motive for seeking my\nreenslavement--avarice and vengeance; and while, as I have said, there\nwas little probability of successful recapture, if attempted openly,\nI was constantly in danger of being spirited away, at a moment when my\nfriends could render me no assistance. In traveling about from place to\nplace--often alone I was much exposed to this sort of attack. Any\none cherishing the design to betray me, could easily do so, by simply\ntracing my whereabouts through the anti-slavery journals, for my\nmeetings and movements were promptly made known in advance. My true\nfriends, Mr. Garrison and Mr. Phillips, had no faith in the power of\nMassachusetts to protect me in my right to liberty. Public sentiment\nand the law, in their opinion, would hand me over to the tormentors. Mr.\nPhillips, especially, considered me in danger, and said, when I showed\nhim the manuscript of my story, if in my place, he would throw it into\nthe fire. Thus, the reader will observe, the settling of one difficulty\nonly opened the way for another; and that though I had reached a free\nstate, and had attained position for public usefulness, I ws(sic) still\ntormented with the liability of losing my liberty. How this liability\nwas dispelled, will be related, with other incidents, in the next\nchapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. _Twenty-One Months in Great Britain_\n\n\nGOOD ARISING OUT OF UNPROPITIOUS EVENTS--DENIED CABIN\nPASSAGE--PROSCRIPTION TURNED TO GOOD ACCOUNT--THE HUTCHINSON FAMILY--THE\nMOB ON BOARD THE “CAMBRIA”--HAPPY INTRODUCTION TO THE BRITISH\nPUBLIC--LETTER ADDRESSED TO WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON--TIME AND\nLABORS WHILE ABROAD--FREEDOM PURCHASED--MRS.

Thus, the painful liability to be returned again\nto slavery, which haunted me by day, and troubled my dreams by night,\nproved to be a necessary step in the path of knowledge and usefulness.\nThe writing of my pamphlet, in the spring of 1845, endangered my\nliberty, and led me to seek a refuge from republican slavery in\nmonarchical England. A rude, uncultivated fugitive slave was driven, by\nstern necessity, to that country to which young American gentlemen go\nto increase their stock of knowledge, to seek pleasure, to have their\nrough, democratic manners softened by contact with English aristocratic\nrefinement. On applying for a passage to England, on board the\n“Cambria”, of the Cunard line, my friend, James N. Buffum, of{285}\nLynn, Massachusetts, was informed that I could not be received on board\nas a cabin passenger. American prejudice against color triumphed over\nBritish liberality and civilization, and erected a color test and\ncondition for crossing the sea in the cabin of a British vessel. The\ninsult was keenly felt by my white friends, but to me, it was common,\nexpected, and therefore, a thing of no great consequence, whether I went\nin the cabin or in the steerage. Moreover, I felt that if I could not go\ninto the first cabin, first-cabin passengers could come into the second\ncabin, and the result justified my anticipations to the fullest extent.\nIndeed, I soon found myself an object of more general interest than\nI wished to be; and so far from being degraded by being placed in the\nsecond cabin, that part of the ship became the scene of as much pleasure\nand refinement, during the voyage, as the cabin itself. The Hutchinson\nFamily, celebrated vocalists--fellow-passengers--often came to my rude\nforecastle deck, and sung their sweetest songs, enlivening the place\nwith eloquent music, as well as spirited conversation, during the\nvoyage. In two days after leaving Boston, one part of the ship was about\nas free to me as another. My fellow-passengers not only visited me, but\ninvited me to visit them, on the saloon deck. My visits there, however,\nwere but seldom. I preferred to live within my privileges, and keep\nupon my own premises. I found this quite as much in accordance with good\npolicy, as with my own feelings. The effect was, that with the majority\nof the passengers, all color distinctions were flung to the winds, and\nI found myself treated with every mark of respect, from the beginning to\nthe end of the voyage, except in a single instance; and in that, I came\nnear being mobbed, for complying with an invitation given me by the\npassengers, and the captain of the “Cambria,” to deliver a lecture on\nslavery. Our New Orleans and Georgia passengers were pleased to regard\nmy lecture as an insult offered to them, and swore I should not speak.\nThey went so far as to threaten to throw me overboard, and but for\nthe firmness of Captain Judkins,{286} probably would have (under the\ninspiration of _slavery_ and _brandy_) attempted to put their threats\ninto execution. I have no space to describe this scene, although its\ntragic and comic peculiarities are well worth describing. An end was put\nto the _melee_, by the captain’s calling the ship’s company to put the\nsalt water mobocrats in irons. At this determined order, the gentlemen\nof the lash scampered, and for the rest of the voyage conducted\nthemselves very decorously.\n\nThis incident of the voyage, in two days after landing at Liverpool,\nbrought me at once before the British public, and that by no act of my\nown. The gentlemen so promptly snubbed in their meditated violence, flew\nto the press to justify their conduct, and to denounce me as a worthless\nand insolent Negro. This course was even less wise than the conduct\nit was intended to sustain; for, besides awakening something like a\nnational interest in me, and securing me an audience, it brought out\ncounter statements, and threw the blame upon themselves, which they had\nsought to fasten upon me and the gallant captain of the ship.\n\nSome notion may be formed of the difference in my feelings and\ncircumstances, while abroad, from the following extract from one of a\nseries of letters addressed by me to Mr. Garrison, and published in the\n_Liberator_. It was written on the first day of January, 1846:\n\n\nMY DEAR FRIEND GARRISON: Up to this time, I have given no direct\nexpression of the views, feelings, and opinions which I have formed,\nrespecting the character and condition of the people of this land. I\nhave refrained thus, purposely. I wish to speak advisedly, and in order\nto do this, I have waited till, I trust, experience has brought my\nopinions to an intelligent maturity. I have been thus careful, not\nbecause I think what I say will have much effect in shaping the opinions\nof the world, but because whatever of influence I may possess, whether\nlittle or much, I wish it to go in the right direction, and according\nto truth. I hardly need say that, in speaking of Ireland, I shall\nbe influenced by no prejudices in favor of America. I think my\ncircumstances all forbid that. I have no end to serve, no creed to\nuphold, no government to defend; and as to nation, I belong to none.\nI have no protection at home, or resting-place abroad. The land of\nmy birth welcomes me to her shores only as a slave, and spurns with\ncontempt the idea of treating me differently; so that I am an outcast\nfrom the society of my childhood, and an outlaw in the{287} land of my\nbirth. “I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers\nwere.” That men should be patriotic, is to me perfectly natural; and\nas a philosophical fact, I am able to give it an _intellectual_\nrecognition. But no further can I go. If ever I had any patriotism, or\nany capacity for the feeling, it was whipped out of me long since, by\nthe lash of the American soul-drivers.\n\nIn thinking of America, I sometimes find myself admiring her bright blue\nsky, her grand old woods, her fertile fields, her beautiful rivers,\nher mighty lakes, and star-crowned mountains. But my rapture is soon\nchecked, my joy is soon turned to mourning. When I remember that all\nis cursed with the infernal spirit of slaveholding, robbery, and wrong;\nwhen I remember that with the waters of her noblest rivers, the tears of\nmy brethren are borne to the ocean, disregarded and forgotten, and that\nher most fertile fields drink daily of the warm blood of my outraged\nsisters; I am filled with unutterable loathing, and led to reproach\nmyself that anything could fall from my lips in praise of such a land.\nAmerica will not allow her children to love her. She seems bent on\ncompelling those who would be her warmest friends, to be her worst\nenemies. May God give her repentance, before it is too late, is the\nardent prayer of my heart. I will continue to pray, labor, and wait,\nbelieving that she cannot always be insensible to the dictates of\njustice, or deaf to the voice of humanity.\n\nMy opportunities for learning the character and condition of the people\nof this land have been very great. I have traveled almost from the Hill\nof Howth to the Giant’s Causeway, and from the Giant’s Causway, to Cape\nClear. During these travels, I have met with much in the chara@@ and\ncondition of the people to approve, and much to condemn; much that\n@@thrilled me with pleasure, and very much that has filled me with\npain. I @@ @@t, in this letter, attempt to give any description of\nthose scenes which have given me pain. This I will do hereafter. I have\nenough, and more than your subscribers will be disposed to read at one\ntime, of the bright side of the picture. I can truly say, I have spent\nsome of the happiest moments of my life since landing in this country. I\nseem to have undergone a transformation. I live a new life. The warm and\ngenerous cooperation extended to me by the friends of my despised race;\nthe prompt and liberal manner with which the press has rendered me its\naid; the glorious enthusiasm with which thousands have flocked to hear\nthe cruel wrongs of my down-trodden and long-enslaved fellow-countrymen\nportrayed; the deep sympathy for the slave, and the strong abhorrence of\nthe slaveholder, everywhere evinced; the cordiality with which members\nand ministers of various religious bodies, and of various shades of\nreligious opinion, have embraced me, and lent me their aid; the kind of\nhospitality constantly proffered to me by persons of the highest rank\nin society; the spirit of freedom that seems to animate all with whom I\ncome in contact, and the entire absence of everything that looked like\nprejudice against me, on account of the color of my skin--contrasted so\nstrongly with my long and bitter experience in the United States, that\nI look with wonder and amazement on the transition. In the southern part\nof the United States, I was a slave, thought of{288} and spoken of\nas property; in the language of the LAW, “_held, taken, reputed, and\nadjudged to be a chattel in the hands of my owners and possessors,\nand their executors, administrators, and assigns, to all intents,\nconstructions, and purposes whatsoever_.” (Brev. Digest, 224). In the\nnorthern states, a fugitive slave, liable to be hunted at any moment,\nlike a felon, and to be hurled into the terrible jaws of slavery--doomed\nby an inveterate prejudice against color to insult and outrage on every\nhand (Massachusetts out of the question)--denied the privileges and\ncourtesies common to others in the use of the most humble means of\nconveyance--shut out from the cabins on steamboats--refused admission\nto respectable hotels--caricatured, scorned, scoffed, mocked, and\nmaltreated with impunity by any one (no matter how black his heart), so\nhe has a white skin. But now behold the change! Eleven days and a half\ngone, and I have crossed three thousand miles of the perilous deep.\nInstead of a democratic government, I am under a monarchical government.\nInstead of the bright, blue sky of America, I am covered with the soft,\ngrey fog of the Emerald Isle. I breathe, and lo! the chattel becomes a\nman. I gaze around in vain for one who will question my equal humanity,\nclaim me as his slave, or offer me an insult. I employ a cab--I am\nseated beside white people--I reach the hotel--I enter the same door--I\nam shown into the same parlor--I dine at the same table and no one is\noffended. No delicate nose grows deformed in my presence. I find no\ndifficulty here in obtaining admission into any place of worship,\ninstruction, or amusement, on equal terms with people as white as any\nI ever saw in the United States. I meet nothing to remind me of my\ncomplexion. I find myself regarded and treated at every turn with the\nkindness and deference paid to white people. When I go to church, I am\nmet by no upturned nose and scornful lip to tell me, “_We don’t allow\nniggers in here_!”\n\nI remember, about two years ago, there was in Boston, near the\nsouth-west corner of Boston Common, a menagerie. I had long desired to\nsee such a collection as I understood was being exhibited there. Never\nhaving had an opportunity while a slave, I resolved to seize this, my\nfirst, since my escape. I went, and as I approached the entrance to\ngain admission, I was met and told by the door-keeper, in a harsh and\ncontemptuous tone, “_We don’t allow niggers in here_.” I also remember\nattending a revival meeting in the Rev. Henry Jackson’s meeting-house,\nat New Bedford, and going up the broad aisle to find a seat, I was met\nby a good deacon, who told me, in a pious tone, “_We don’t allow niggers\nin here_!” Soon after my arrival in New Bedford, from the south, I had\na strong desire to attend the Lyceum, but was told, “_They don’t allow\nniggers in here_!” While passing from New York to Boston, on the steamer\nMassachusetts, on the night of the 9th of December, 1843, when chilled\nalmost through with the cold, I went into the cabin to get a little\nwarm. I was soon touched upon the shoulder, and told, “_We don’t allow\nniggers in here_!” On arriving in Boston, from an anti-slavery tour,\nhungry and tired, I went into an eating-house, near my friend, Mr.\nCampbell’s to get some refreshments. I was met by a lad in a white\napron, “_We don’t allow niggers in here_!”{289} A week or two before\nleaving the United States, I had a meeting appointed at Weymouth, the\nhome of that glorious band of true abolitionists, the Weston family, and\nothers. On attempting to take a seat in the omnibus to that place, I\nwas told by the driver (and I never shall forget his fiendish hate). “_I\ndon’t allow niggers in here_!” Thank heaven for the respite I now\nenjoy! I had been in Dublin but a few days, when a gentleman of great\nrespectability kindly offered to conduct me through all the public\nbuildings of that beautiful city; and a little afterward, I found myself\ndining with the lord mayor of Dublin. What a pity there was not some\nAmerican democratic Christian at the door of his splendid mansion, to\nbark out at my approach, “_They don’t allow niggers in here_!” The truth\nis, the people here know nothing of the republican Negro hate prevalent\nin our glorious land. They measure and esteem men according to their\nmoral and intellectual worth, and not according to the color of their\nskin. Whatever may be said of the aristocracies here, there is none\nbased on the color of a man’s skin. This species of aristocracy belongs\npreeminently to “the land of the free, and the home of the brave.” I\nhave never found it abroad, in any but Americans. It sticks to them\nwherever they go. They find it almost as hard to get rid of, as to get\nrid of their skins.\n\nThe second day after my arrival at Liverpool, in company with my friend,\nBuffum, and several other friends, I went to Eaton Hall, the residence\nof the Marquis of Westminster, one of the most splendid buildings\nin England. On approaching the door, I found several of our American\npassengers, who came out with us in the “Cambria,” waiting for\nadmission, as but one party was allowed in the house at a time. We all\nhad to wait till the company within came out. And of all the faces,\nexpressive of chagrin, those of the Americans were preeminent. They\nlooked as sour as vinegar, and as bitter as gall, when they found I was\nto be admitted on equal terms with themselves. When the door was opened,\nI walked in, on an equal footing with my white fellow-citizens, and from\nall I could see, I had as much attention paid me by the servants that\nshowed us through the house, as any with a paler skin. As I walked\nthrough the building, the statuary did not fall down, the pictures did\nnot leap from their places, the doors did not refuse to open, and the\nservants did not say, “_We don’t allow niggers in here_!”\n\nA happy new-year to you, and all the friends of freedom.\n\n\nMy time and labors, while abroad were divided between England, Ireland,\nScotland, and Wales. Upon this experience alone, I might write a book\ntwice the size of this, _My Bondage and My Freedom_. I visited and\nlectured in nearly all the large towns and cities in the United\nKingdom, and enjoyed many favorable opportunities for observation and\ninformation. But books on England are abundant, and the public may,\ntherefore, dismiss any fear that I am meditating another infliction in\nthat line;{290} though, in truth, I should like much to write a book\non those countries, if for nothing else, to make grateful mention of the\nmany dear friends, whose benevolent actions toward me are ineffaceably\nstamped upon my memory, and warmly treasured in my heart. To these\nfriends I owe my freedom in the United States. On their own motion,\nwithout any solicitation from me (Mrs. Henry Richardson, a clever lady,\nremarkable for her devotion to every good work, taking the lead), they\nraised a fund sufficient to purchase my freedom, and actually paid it\nover, and placed the papers [8] of my manumission in my hands, before\n{291} they would tolerate the idea of my returning to this, my native\ncountry. To this commercial transaction I owe my exemption from the\ndemocratic operation of the Fugitive Slave Bill of 1850. But for this,\nI might at any time become a victim of this most cruel and scandalous\nenactment, and be doomed to end my life, as I began it, a slave. The sum\npaid for my freedom was one hundred and fifty pounds sterling.\n\nSome of my uncompromising anti-slavery friends in this country failed\nto see the wisdom of this arrangement, and were not pleased that I\nconsented to it, even by my silence. They thought it a violation of\nanti-slavery principles--conceding a right of property in man--and a\nwasteful expenditure of money. On the other hand, viewing it simply in\nthe light of a ransom, or as money extorted by a robber, and my liberty\nof more value than one hundred and fifty pounds sterling, I could not\nsee either a violation of the laws of morality, or those of economy, in\nthe transaction.\n\nIt is true, I was not in the possession of my claimants, and could have\neasily remained in England, for the same friends who had so generously\npurchased my freedom, would have assisted me in establishing myself in\nthat country. To this, however, I could not consent. I felt that I had a\nduty to perform--and that was, to labor and suffer with the oppressed\nin my native land. Considering, therefore, all the circumstances--the\nfugitive slave bill included--I think the very best thing was done in\nletting Master Hugh have the hundred and fifty pounds sterling, and\nleaving me free to return to my appropriate field of labor. Had I been\na private person, having no other relations or duties than those of a\npersonal and family nature, I should never have consented to the\npayment of so large a sum for the privilege of living securely under\nour glorious republican form of government. I could have remained in\nEngland, or have gone to some other country; and perhaps I could even\nhave lived unobserved in this. But to this I could not consent. I had\nalready become some{292} what notorious, and withal quite as unpopular\nas notorious; and I was, therefore, much exposed to arrest and\nrecapture.\n\nThe main object to which my labors in Great Britain were directed, was\nthe concentration of the moral and religious sentiment of its people\nagainst American slavery. England is often charged with having\nestablished slavery in the United States, and if there were no other\njustification than this, for appealing to her people to lend their moral\naid for the abolition of slavery, I should be justified. My speeches in\nGreat Britain were wholly extemporaneous, and I may not always have been\nso guarded in my expressions, as I otherwise should have been. I was ten\nyears younger then than now, and only seven years from slavery. I cannot\ngive the reader a better idea of the nature of my discourses, than by\nrepublishing one of them, delivered in Finsbury chapel, London, to an\naudience of about two thousand persons, and which was published in the\n_London Universe_, at the time. [9]\n\nThose in the United States who may regard this speech as being harsh\nin its spirit and unjust in its statements, because delivered before\nan audience supposed to be anti-republican in their principles and\nfeelings, may view the matter differently, when they learn that the case\nsupposed did not exist. It so happened that the great mass of the people\nin England who attended and patronized my anti-slavery meetings, were,\nin truth, about as good republicans as the mass of Americans, and with\nthis decided advantage over the latter--they are lovers of republicanism\nfor all men, for black men as well as for white men. They are the people\nwho sympathize with Louis Kossuth and Mazzini, and with the oppressed\nand enslaved, of every color and nation, the world over. They constitute\nthe democratic element in British politics, and are as much opposed to\nthe union of church and state as we, in America, are to such an union.\nAt the meeting where this speech was delivered, Joseph Sturge--a\nworld-wide philanthropist,{293} and a member of the society of\nFriends--presided, and addressed the meeting. George William Alexander,\nanother Friend, who has spent more than an Ameriacn(sic) fortune in\npromoting the anti-slavery cause in different sections of the world, was\non the platform; and also Dr. Campbell (now of the _British Banner_) who\ncombines all the humane tenderness of Melanchthon, with the\ndirectness and boldness of Luther. He is in the very front ranks of\nnon-conformists, and looks with no unfriendly eye upon America. George\nThompson, too, was there; and America will yet own that he did a\ntrue man’s work in relighting the rapidly dying-out fire of true\nrepublicanism in the American heart, and be ashamed of the treatment he\nmet at her hands. Coming generations in this country will applaud the\nspirit of this much abused republican friend of freedom. There were\nothers of note seated on the platform, who would gladly ingraft upon\nEnglish institutions all that is purely republican in the institutions\nof America. Nothing, therefore, must be set down against this speech\non the score that it was delivered in the presence of those who\ncannot appreciate the many excellent things belonging to our system\nof government, and with a view to stir up prejudice against republican\ninstitutions.\n\nAgain, let it also be remembered--for it is the simple truth--that\nneither in this speech, nor in any other which I delivered in England,\ndid I ever allow myself to address Englishmen as against Americans.\nI took my stand on the high ground of human brotherhood, and spoke to\nEnglishmen as men, in behalf of men. Slavery is a crime, not against\nEnglishmen, but against God, and all the members of the human family;\nand it belongs to the whole human family to seek its suppression. In a\nletter to Mr. Greeley, of the New York Tribune, written while abroad, I\nsaid:\n\n\nI am, nevertheless aware that the wisdom of exposing the sins of one\nnation in the ear of another, has been seriously questioned by good and\nclear-sighted people, both on this and on your side of the Atlantic. And\nthe{294} thought is not without weight on my own mind. I am satisfied\nthat there are many evils which can be best removed by confining our\nefforts to the immediate locality where such evils exist. This, however,\nis by no means the case with the system of slavery. It is such a giant\nsin--such a monstrous aggregation of iniquity--so hardening to the human\nheart--so destructive to the moral sense, and so well calculated\nto beget a character, in every one around it, favorable to its own\ncontinuance,--that I feel not only at liberty, but abundantly justified,\nin appealing to the whole world to aid in its removal.\n\n\nBut, even if I had--as has been often charged--labored to bring American\ninstitutions generally into disrepute, and had not confined my labors\nstrictly within the limits of humanity and morality, I should not have\nbeen without illustrious examples to support me. Driven into semi-exile\nby civil and barbarous laws, and by a system which cannot be thought of\nwithout a shudder, I was fully justified in turning, if possible, the\ntide of the moral universe against the heaven-daring outrage.\n\nFour circumstances greatly assisted me in getting the question of\nAmerican slavery before the British public. First, the mob on board\nthe “Cambria,” already referred to, which was a sort of national\nannouncement of my arrival in England. Secondly, the highly\nreprehensible course pursued by the Free Church of Scotland, in\nsoliciting, receiving, and retaining money in its sustentation fund for\nsupporting the gospel in Scotland, which was evidently the ill-gotten\ngain of slaveholders and slave-traders. Third, the great Evangelical\nAlliance--or rather the attempt to form such an alliance, which should\ninclude slaveholders of a certain description--added immensely to the\ninterest felt in the slavery question. About the same time, there was\nthe World’s Temperance Convention, where I had the misfortune to come\nin collision with sundry American doctors of divinity--Dr. Cox among the\nnumber--with whom I had a small controversy.\n\nIt has happened to me--as it has happened to most other men engaged in a\ngood cause--often to be more indebted to my enemies than to my own skill\nor to the assistance of my friends, for whatever success has attended my\nlabors. Great surprise was{295} expressed by American newspapers, north\nand south, during my stay in Great Britain, that a person so illiterate\nand insignificant as myself could awaken an interest so marked in\nEngland. These papers were not the only parties surprised. I was myself\nnot far behind them in surprise. But the very contempt and scorn, the\nsystematic and extravagant disparagement of which I was the object,\nserved, perhaps, to magnify my few merits, and to render me of some\naccount, whether deserving or not. A man is sometimes made great, by\nthe greatness of the abuse a portion of mankind may think proper to heap\nupon him. Whether I was of as much consequence as the English papers\nmade me out to be, or not, it was easily seen, in England, that I could\nnot be the ignorant and worthless creature, some of the American\npapers would have them believe I was. Men, in their senses, do not take\nbowie-knives to kill mosquitoes, nor pistols to shoot flies; and the\nAmerican passengers who thought proper to get up a mob to silence me,\non board the “Cambria,” took the most effective method of telling the\nBritish public that I had something to say.\n\nBut to the second circumstance, namely, the position of the Free Church\nof Scotland, with the great Doctors Chalmers, Cunningham, and Candlish\nat its head. That church, with its leaders, put it out of the power of\nthe Scotch people to ask the old question, which we in the north have\noften most wickedly asked--“_What have we to do with slavery_?” That\nchurch had taken the price of blood into its treasury, with which to\nbuild _free_ churches, and to pay _free_ church ministers for preaching\nthe gospel; and, worse still, when honest John Murray, of Bowlien\nBay--now gone to his reward in heaven--with William Smeal, Andrew\nPaton, Frederick Card, and other sterling anti-slavery men in Glasgow,\ndenounced the transaction as disgraceful and shocking to the religious\nsentiment of Scotland, this church, through its leading divines, instead\nof repenting and seeking to mend the mistake into which it had fallen,\nmade it a flagrant sin, by undertaking to defend, in the name of God\nand the bible, the principle not only{296} of taking the money of\nslave-dealers to build churches, but of holding fellowship with the\nholders and traffickers in human flesh. This, the reader will see,\nbrought up the whole question of slavery, and opened the way to its full\ndiscussion, without any agency of mine. I have never seen a people more\ndeeply moved than were the people of Scotland, on this very question.\nPublic meeting succeeded public meeting. Speech after speech, pamphlet\nafter pamphlet, editorial after editorial, sermon after sermon, soon\nlashed the conscientious Scotch people into a perfect _furore_. “SEND\nBACK THE MONEY!” was indignantly cried out, from Greenock to Edinburgh,\nand from Edinburgh to Aberdeen. George Thompson, of London, Henry C.\nWright, of the United States, James N. Buffum, of Lynn, Massachusetts,\nand myself were on the anti-slavery side; and Doctors Chalmers,\nCunningham, and Candlish on the other. In a conflict where the latter\ncould have had even the show of right, the truth, in our hands as\nagainst them, must have been driven to the wall; and while I believe we\nwere able to carry the conscience of the country against the action of\nthe Free Church, the battle, it must be confessed, was a hard-fought\none. Abler defenders of the doctrine of fellowshiping slaveholders as\nchristians, have not been met with. In defending this doctrine, it was\nnecessary to deny that slavery is a sin. If driven from this position,\nthey were compelled to deny that slaveholders were responsible for the\nsin; and if driven from both these positions, they must deny that it\nis a sin in such a sense, and that slaveholders are sinners in such\na sense, as to make it wrong, in the circumstances in which they were\nplaced, to recognize them as Christians. Dr. Cunningham was the most\npowerful debater on the slavery side of the question; Mr. Thompson was\nthe ablest on the anti-slavery side. A scene occurred between these two\nmen, a parallel to which I think I never witnessed before, and I know\nI never have since. The scene was caused by a single exclamation on the\npart of Mr. Thompson.\n\nThe general assembly of the Free Church was in progress at{297} Cannon\nMills, Edinburgh. The building would hold about twenty-five hundred\npersons; and on this occasion it was densely packed, notice having been\ngiven that Doctors Cunningham and Candlish would speak, that day, in\ndefense of the relations of the Free Church of Scotland to slavery\nin America. Messrs. Thompson, Buffum, myself, and a few anti-slavery\nfriends, attended, but sat at such a distance, and in such a position,\nthat, perhaps we were not observed from the platform. The excitement was\nintense, having been greatly increased by a series of meetings held by\nMessrs. Thompson, Wright, Buffum, and myself, in the most splendid\nhall in that most beautiful city, just previous to the meetings of the\ngeneral assembly. “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” stared at us from every street\ncorner; “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” in large capitals, adorned the broad\nflags of the pavement; “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” was the chorus of the\npopular street songs; “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” was the heading of leading\neditorials in the daily newspapers. This day, at Cannon Mills, the great\ndoctors of the church were to give an answer to this loud and stern\ndemand. Men of all parties and all sects were most eager to hear.\nSomething great was expected. The occasion was great, the men great, and\ngreat speeches were expected from them.\n\nIn addition to the outside pressure upon Doctors Cunningham and\nCandlish, there was wavering in their own ranks. The conscience of the\nchurch itself was not at ease. A dissatisfaction with the position of\nthe church touching slavery, was sensibly manifest among the members,\nand something must be done to counteract this untoward influence. The\ngreat Dr. Chalmers was in feeble health, at the time. His most potent\neloquence could not now be summoned to Cannon Mills, as formerly. He\nwhose voice was able to rend asunder and dash down the granite walls\nof the established church of Scotland, and to lead a host in solemn\nprocession from it, as from a doomed city, was now old and enfeebled.\nBesides, he had said his word on this very question; and his word had\nnot silenced the clamor without, nor stilled{298} the anxious heavings\nwithin. The occasion was momentous, and felt to be so. The church was\nin a perilous condition. A change of some sort must take place in\nher condition, or she must go to pieces. To stand where she did, was\nimpossible. The whole weight of the matter fell on Cunningham and\nCandlish. No shoulders in the church were broader than theirs; and I\nmust say, badly as I detest the principles laid down and defended by\nthem, I was compelled to acknowledge the vast mental endowments of the\nmen. Cunningham rose; and his rising was the signal for almost tumultous\napplause. You will say this was scarcely in keeping with the solemnity\nof the occasion, but to me it served to increase its grandeur and\ngravity. The applause, though tumultuous, was not joyous. It seemed\nto me, as it thundered up from the vast audience, like the fall of\nan immense shaft, flung from shoulders already galled by its crushing\nweight. It was like saying, “Doctor, we have borne this burden long\nenough, and willingly fling it upon you. Since it was you who brought it\nupon us, take it now, and do what you will with it, for we are too weary\nto bear it.{no close “}\n\nDoctor Cunningham proceeded with his speech, abounding in logic,\nlearning, and eloquence, and apparently bearing down all opposition;\nbut at the moment--the fatal moment--when he was just bringing all his\narguments to a point, and that point being, that neither Jesus Christ\nnor his holy apostles regarded slaveholding as a sin, George Thompson,\nin a clear, sonorous, but rebuking voice, broke the deep stillness of\nthe audience, exclaiming, HEAR! HEAR! HEAR! The effect of this simple\nand common exclamation is almost incredible. It was as if a granite wall\nhad been suddenly flung up against the advancing current of a mighty\nriver. For a moment, speaker and audience were brought to a dead\nsilence. Both the doctor and his hearers seemed appalled by the\naudacity, as well as the fitness of the rebuke. At length a shout went\nup to the cry of “_Put him out_!” Happily, no one attempted to execute\nthis cowardly order, and the doctor proceeded with his discourse.\nNot, however, as before, did the{299} learned doctor proceed. The\nexclamation of Thompson must have reechoed itself a thousand times in\nhis memory, during the remainder of his speech, for the doctor never\nrecovered from the blow.\n\nThe deed was done, however; the pillars of the church--_the proud, Free\nChurch of Scotland_--were committed and the humility of repentance\nwas absent. The Free Church held on to the blood-stained money, and\ncontinued to justify itself in its position--and of course to apologize\nfor slavery--and does so till this day. She lost a glorious opportunity\nfor giving her voice, her vote, and her example to the cause of\nhumanity; and to-day she is staggering under the curse of the enslaved,\nwhose blood is in her skirts. The people of Scotland are, to this day,\ndeeply grieved at the course pursued by the Free Church, and would\nhail, as a relief from a deep and blighting shame, the “sending back the\nmoney” to the slaveholders from whom it was gathered.\n\nOne good result followed the conduct of the Free Church; it furnished\nan occasion for making the people of Scotland thoroughly acquainted with\nthe character of slavery, and for arraying against the system the moral\nand religious sentiment of that country. Therefore, while we did\nnot succeed in accomplishing the specific object of our mission,\nnamely--procure the sending back of the money--we were amply justified\nby the good which really did result from our labors.\n\nNext comes the Evangelical Alliance. This was an attempt to form a union\nof all evangelical Christians throughout the world. Sixty or seventy\nAmerican divines attended, and some of them went there merely to weave\na world-wide garment with which to clothe evangelical slaveholders.\nForemost among these divines, was the Rev. Samuel Hanson Cox, moderator\nof the New School Presbyterian General Assembly. He and his friends\nspared no pains to secure a platform broad enough to hold American\nslaveholders, and in this partly succeeded. But the question of slavery\nis too large a question to be finally disposed of, even by the{300}\nEvangelical Alliance. We appealed from the judgment of the Alliance,\nto the judgment of the people of Great Britain, and with the happiest\neffect. This controversy with the Alliance might be made the subject of\nextended remark, but I must forbear, except to say, that this effort to\nshield the Christian character of slaveholders greatly served to open a\nway to the British ear for anti-slavery discussion, and that it was well\nimproved.\n\nThe fourth and last circumstance that assisted me in getting before\nthe British public, was an attempt on the part of certain doctors\nof divinity to silence me on the platform of the World’s Temperance\nConvention. Here I was brought into point blank collison with Rev.\nDr. Cox, who made me the subject not only of bitter remark in the\nconvention, but also of a long denunciatory letter published in the New\nYork Evangelist and other American papers. I replied to the doctor as\nwell as I could, and was successful in getting a respectful hearing\nbefore the British public, who are by nature and practice ardent lovers\nof fair play, especially in a conflict between the weak and the strong.\n\nThus did circumstances favor me, and favor the cause of which I strove\nto be the advocate. After such distinguished notice, the public in both\ncountries was compelled to attach some importance to my labors. By the\nvery ill usage I received at the hands of Dr. Cox and his party, by the\nmob on board the “Cambria,” by the attacks made upon me in the American\nnewspapers, and by the aspersions cast upon me through the organs of the\nFree Church of Scotland, I became one of that class of men, who, for the\nmoment, at least, “have greatness forced upon them.” People became the\nmore anxious to hear for themselves, and to judge for themselves, of the\ntruth which I had to unfold. While, therefore, it is by no means easy\nfor a stranger to get fairly before the British public, it was my lot to\naccomplish it in the easiest manner possible.\n\nHaving continued in Great Britain and Ireland nearly two years, and\nbeing about to return to America--not as I left it, a{301} slave, but\na freeman--leading friends of the cause of emancipation in that country\nintimated their intention to make me a testimonial, not only on grounds\nof personal regard to myself, but also to the cause to which they were\nso ardently devoted. How far any such thing could have succeeded, I\ndo not know; but many reasons led me to prefer that my friends should\nsimply give me the means of obtaining a printing press and printing\nmaterials, to enable me to start a paper, devoted to the interests of\nmy enslaved and oppressed people. I told them that perhaps the greatest\nhinderance to the adoption of abolition principles by the people of the\nUnited States, was the low estimate, everywhere in that country,\nplaced upon the Negro, as a man; that because of his assumed natural\ninferiority, people reconciled themselves to his enslavement and\noppression, as things inevitable, if not desirable. The grand thing to\nbe done, therefore, was to change the estimation in which the colored\npeople of the United States were held; to remove the prejudice which\ndepreciated and depressed them; to prove them worthy of a higher\nconsideration; to disprove their alleged inferiority, and demonstrate\ntheir capacity for a more exalted civilization than slavery and\nprejudice had assigned to them. I further stated, that, in my judgment,\na tolerably well conducted press, in the hands of persons of the\ndespised race, by calling out the mental energies of the race itself; by\nmaking them acquainted with their own latent powers; by enkindling among\nthem the hope that for them there is a future; by developing their moral\npower; by combining and reflecting their talents--would prove a most\npowerful means of removing prejudice, and of awakening an interest\nin them. I further informed them--and at that time the statement was\ntrue--that there was not, in the United States, a single newspaper\nregularly published by the colored people; that many attempts had been\nmade to establish such papers; but that, up to that time, they had all\nfailed. These views I laid before my friends. The result was, nearly two\nthousand five hundred dollars were speedily{302} raised toward starting\nmy paper. For this prompt and generous assistance, rendered upon my bare\nsuggestion, without any personal efforts on my part, I shall never\ncease to feel deeply grateful; and the thought of fulfilling the noble\nexpectations of the dear friends who gave me this evidence of their\nconfidence, will never cease to be a motive for persevering exertion.\n\nProposing to leave England, and turning my face toward America, in\nthe spring of 1847, I was met, on the threshold, with something which\npainfully reminded me of the kind of life which awaited me in my native\nland. For the first time in the many months spent abroad, I was met with\nproscription on account of my color. A few weeks before departing from\nEngland, while in London, I was careful to purchase a ticket, and secure\na berth for returning home, in the “Cambria”--the steamer in which I\nleft the United States--paying therefor the round sum of forty pounds\nand nineteen shillings sterling. This was first cabin fare. But on going\naboard the Cambria, I found that the Liverpool agent had ordered my\nberth to be given to another, and had forbidden my entering the saloon!\nThis contemptible conduct met with stern rebuke from the British press.\nFor, upon the point of leaving England, I took occasion to expose the\ndisgusting tyranny, in the columns of the London _Times_. That journal,\nand other leading journals throughout the United Kingdom, held up the\noutrage to unmitigated condemnation. So good an opportunity for calling\nout a full expression of British sentiment on the subject, had not\nbefore occurred, and it was most fully embraced. The result was, that\nMr. Cunard came out in a letter to the public journals, assuring them\nof his regret at the outrage, and promising that the like should never\noccur again on board his steamers; and the like, we believe, has never\nsince occurred on board the steamships of the Cunard line.\n\nIt is not very pleasant to be made the subject of such insults; but if\nall such necessarily resulted as this one did, I should be very happy\nto bear, patiently, many more than I have borne, of{303} the same sort.\nAlbeit, the lash of proscription, to a man accustomed to equal social\nposition, even for a time, as I was, has a sting for the soul hardly\nless severe than that which bites the flesh and draws the blood from the\nback of the plantation slave. It was rather hard, after having enjoyed\nnearly two years of equal social privileges in England, often dining\nwith gentlemen of great literary, social, political, and religious\neminence never, during the whole time, having met with a single word,\nlook, or gesture, which gave me the slightest reason to think my color\nwas an offense to anybody--now to be cooped up in the stern of the\n“Cambria,” and denied the right to enter the saloon, lest my dark\npresence should be deemed an offense to some of my democratic\nfellow-passengers. The reader will easily imagine what must have been my\nfeelings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. _Various Incidents_\n\nNEWSPAPER ENTERPRISE--UNEXPECTED OPPOSITION--THE OBJECTIONS TO IT--THEIR\nPLAUSIBILITY ADMITTED--MOTIVES FOR COMING TO ROCHESTER--DISCIPLE OF MR.\nGARRISON--CHANGE OF OPINION--CAUSES LEADING TO IT--THE CONSEQUENCES OF\nTHE CHANGE--PREJUDICE AGAINST COLOR--AMUSING CONDESCENSION--“JIM CROW\nCARS”--COLLISIONS WITH CONDUCTORS AND BRAKEMEN--TRAINS ORDERED NOT TO\nSTOP AT LYNN--AMUSING DOMESTIC SCENE--SEPARATE TABLES FOR MASTER AND\nMAN--PREJUDICE UNNATURAL--ILLUSTRATIONS--IN HIGH COMPANY--ELEVATION OF\nTHE FREE PEOPLE OF COLOR--PLEDGE FOR THE FUTURE.\n\n\nI have now given the reader an imperfect sketch of nine years’\nexperience in freedom--three years as a common laborer on the wharves of\nNew Bedford, four years as a lecturer in New England, and two years of\nsemi-exile in Great Britain and Ireland. A single ray of light remains\nto be flung upon my life during the last eight years, and my story will\nbe done.\n\nA trial awaited me on my return from England to the United States, for\nwhich I was but very imperfectly prepared. My plans for my then future\nusefulness as an anti-slavery advocate were all settled. My friends in\nEngland had resolved to raise a given sum to purchase for me a press and\nprinting materials; and I already saw myself wielding my pen, as well as\nmy voice, in the great work of renovating the public mind, and\nbuilding up a public sentiment which should, at least, send slavery\nand oppression to the grave, and restore to “liberty and the pursuit of\nhappiness” the people with whom I had suffered, both as a{305} slave\nand as a freeman. Intimation had reached my friends in Boston of what\nI intended to do, before my arrival, and I was prepared to find them\nfavorably disposed toward my much cherished enterprise. In this I was\nmistaken. I found them very earnestly opposed to the idea of my starting\na paper, and for several reasons. First, the paper was not needed;\nsecondly, it would interfere with my usefulness as a lecturer; thirdly,\nI was better fitted to speak than to write; fourthly, the paper could\nnot succeed. This opposition, from a quarter so highly esteemed, and to\nwhich I had been accustomed to look for advice and direction, caused\nme not only to hesitate, but inclined me to abandon the enterprise. All\nprevious attempts to establish such a journal having failed, I felt\nthat probably I should but add another to the list of failures, and\nthus contribute another proof of the mental and moral deficiencies of my\nrace. Very much that was said to me in respect to my imperfect literary\nacquirements, I felt to be most painfully true. The unsuccessful\nprojectors of all the previous colored newspapers were my superiors in\npoint of education, and if they failed, how could I hope for success?\nYet I did hope for success, and persisted in the undertaking. Some of my\nEnglish friends greatly encouraged me to go forward, and I shall never\ncease to be grateful for their words of cheer and generous deeds.\n\nI can easily pardon those who have denounced me as ambitious and\npresumptuous, in view of my persistence in this enterprise. I was but\nnine years from slavery. In point of mental experience, I was but nine\nyears old. That one, in such circumstances, should aspire to establish\na printing press, among an educated people, might well be considered,\nif not ambitious, quite silly. My American friends looked at me with\nastonishment! “A wood-sawyer” offering himself to the public as an\neditor! A slave, brought up in the very depths of ignorance, assuming to\ninstruct the highly civilized people of the north in the principles of\nliberty, justice, and humanity! The thing looked absurd. Nevertheless,\nI{306} persevered. I felt that the want of education, great as it was,\ncould be overcome by study, and that knowledge would come by experience;\nand further (which was perhaps the most controlling consideration).\nI thought that an intelligent public, knowing my early history, would\neasily pardon a large share of the deficiencies which I was sure that\nmy paper would exhibit. The most distressing thing, however, was the\noffense which I was about to give my Boston friends, by what seemed to\nthem a reckless disregard of their sage advice. I am not sure that I\nwas not under the influence of something like a slavish adoration of my\nBoston friends, and I labored hard to convince them of the wisdom of\nmy undertaking, but without success. Indeed, I never expect to succeed,\nalthough time has answered all their original objections. The paper\nhas been successful. It is a large sheet, costing eighty dollars per\nweek--has three thousand subscribers--has been published regularly\nnearly eight years--and bids fair to stand eight years longer. At any\nrate, the eight years to come are as full of promise as were the eight\nthat are past.\n\nIt is not to be concealed, however, that the maintenance of such a\njournal, under the circumstances, has been a work of much difficulty;\nand could all the perplexity, anxiety, and trouble attending it, have\nbeen clearly foreseen, I might have shrunk from the undertaking. As it\nis, I rejoice in having engaged in the enterprise, and count it joy to\nhave been able to suffer, in many ways, for its success, and for the\nsuccess of the cause to which it has been faithfully devoted. I look\nupon the time, money, and labor bestowed upon it, as being amply\nrewarded, in the development of my own mental and moral energies, and in\nthe corresponding development of my deeply injured and oppressed people.\n\nFrom motives of peace, instead of issuing my paper in Boston, among\nmy New England friends, I came to Rochester, western New York, among\nstrangers, where the circulation of my paper could not interfere with\nthe local circulation of the _Liberator_ and the _Standard;_ for at\nthat time I was, on the anti-slavery question,{307 CHANGE OF VIEWS} a\nfaithful disciple of William Lloyd Garrison, and fully committed to his\ndoctrine touching the pro-slavery character of the constitution of the\nUnited States, and the _non-voting principle_, of which he is the known\nand distinguished advocate. With Mr. Garrison, I held it to be the\nfirst duty of the non-slaveholding states to dissolve the union with\nthe slaveholding states; and hence my cry, like his, was, “No union\nwith slaveholders.” With these views, I came into western New York; and\nduring the first four years of my labor here, I advocated them with pen\nand tongue, according to the best of my ability.\n\nAbout four years ago, upon a reconsideration of the whole subject, I\nbecame convinced that there was no necessity for dissolving the “union\nbetween the northern and southern states;” that to seek this dissolution\nwas no part of my duty as an abolitionist; that to abstain from voting,\nwas to refuse to exercise a legitimate and powerful means for abolishing\nslavery; and that the constitution of the United States not only\ncontained no guarantees in favor of slavery, but, on the contrary, it\nis, in its letter and spirit, an anti-slavery instrument, demanding the\nabolition of slavery as a condition of its own existence, as the supreme\nlaw of the land.\n\nHere was a radical change in my opinions, and in the action logically\nresulting from that change. To those with whom I had been in agreement\nand in sympathy, I was now in opposition. What they held to be a great\nand important truth, I now looked upon as a dangerous error. A very\npainful, and yet a very natural, thing now happened. Those who could not\nsee any honest reasons for changing their views, as I had done, could\nnot easily see any such reasons for my change, and the common punishment\nof apostates was mine.\n\nThe opinions first entertained were naturally derived and honestly\nentertained, and I trust that my present opinions have the same claims\nto respect. Brought directly, when I escaped from slavery, into contact\nwith a class of abolitionists regarding the{308} constitution as a\nslaveholding instrument, and finding their views supported by the united\nand entire history of every department of the government, it is\nnot strange that I assumed the constitution to be just what their\ninterpretation made it. I was bound, not only by their superior\nknowledge, to take their opinions as the true ones, in respect to the\nsubject, but also because I had no means of showing their unsoundness.\nBut for the responsibility of conducting a public journal, and the\nnecessity imposed upon me of meeting opposite views from abolitionists\nin this state, I should in all probability have remained as firm in my\ndisunion views as any other disciple of William Lloyd Garrison.\n\nMy new circumstances compelled me to re-think the whole subject, and\nto study, with some care, not only the just and proper rules of legal\ninterpretation, but the origin, design, nature, rights, powers, and\nduties of civil government, and also the relations which human beings\nsustain to it. By such a course of thought and reading, I was\nconducted to the conclusion that the constitution of the United\nStates--inaugurated “to form a more perfect union, establish justice,\ninsure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote\nthe general welfare, and secure the blessing of liberty”--could not well\nhave been designed at the same time to maintain and perpetuate a system\nof rapine and murder, like slavery; especially, as not one word can be\nfound in the constitution to authorize such a belief. Then, again, if\nthe declared purposes of an instrument are to govern the meaning of all\nits parts and details, as they clearly should, the constitution of our\ncountry is our warrant for the abolition of slavery in every state in\nthe American Union. I mean, however, not to argue, but simply to state\nmy views. It would require very many pages of a volume like this, to\nset forth the arguments demonstrating the unconstitutionality and the\ncomplete illegality of slavery in our land; and as my experience, and\nnot my arguments, is within the scope and contemplation of this volume,\nI omit the latter and proceed with the former.{309}\n\nI will now ask the kind reader to go back a little in my story, while I\nbring up a thread left behind for convenience sake, but which, small\nas it is, cannot be properly omitted altogether; and that thread is\nAmerican prejudice against color, and its varied illustrations in my own\nexperience.\n\nWhen I first went among the abolitionists of New England, and began\nto travel, I found this prejudice very strong and very annoying. The\nabolitionists themselves were not entirely free from it, and I could\nsee that they were nobly struggling against it. In their eagerness,\nsometimes, to show their contempt for the feeling, they proved that they\nhad not entirely recovered from it; often illustrating the saying,\nin their conduct, that a man may “stand up so straight as to lean\nbackward.” When it was said to me, “Mr. Douglass, I will walk to\nmeeting with you; I am not afraid of a black man,” I could not help\nthinking--seeing nothing very frightful in my appearance--“And why\nshould you be?” The children at the north had all been educated\nto believe that if they were bad, the old _black_ man--not the old\n_devil_--would get them; and it was evidence of some courage, for any so\neducated to get the better of their fears.\n\nThe custom of providing separate cars for the accommodation of colored\ntravelers, was established on nearly all the railroads of New England, a\ndozen years ago. Regarding this custom as fostering the spirit of caste,\nI made it a rule to seat myself in the cars for the accommodation of\npassengers generally. Thus seated, I was sure to be called upon to\nbetake myself to the “_Jim Crow car_.” Refusing to obey, I was often\ndragged out of my seat, beaten, and severely bruised, by conductors and\nbrakemen. Attempting to start from Lynn, one day, for Newburyport, on\nthe Eastern railroad, I went, as my custom was, into one of the best\nrailroad carriages on the road. The seats were very luxuriant and\nbeautiful. I was soon waited upon by the conductor, and ordered out;\nwhereupon I demanded the reason for my invidious removal. After a good\ndeal of parleying, I was told that it was because I{310} was black. This\nI denied, and appealed to the company to sustain my denial; but they\nwere evidently unwilling to commit themselves, on a point so delicate,\nand requiring such nice powers of discrimination, for they remained as\ndumb as death. I was soon waited on by half a dozen fellows of the\nbaser sort (just such as would volunteer to take a bull-dog out of a\nmeeting-house in time of public worship), and told that I must move out\nof that seat, and if I did not, they would drag me out. I refused\nto move, and they clutched me, head, neck, and shoulders. But, in\nanticipation of the stretching to which I was about to be subjected,\nI had interwoven myself among the seats. In dragging me out, on this\noccasion, it must have cost the company twenty-five or thirty dollars,\nfor I tore up seats and all. So great was the excitement in Lynn, on\nthe subject, that the superintendent, Mr. Stephen A. Chase, ordered the\ntrains to run through Lynn without stopping, while I remained in that\ntown; and this ridiculous farce was enacted. For several days the trains\nwent dashing through Lynn without stopping. At the same time that they\nexcluded a free colored man from their cars, this same company\nallowed slaves, in company with their masters and mistresses, to ride\nunmolested.\n\nAfter many battles with the railroad conductors, and being roughly\nhandled in not a few instances, proscription was at last abandoned; and\nthe “Jim Crow car”--set up for the degradation of colored people--is\nnowhere found in New England. This result was not brought about without\nthe intervention of the people, and the threatened enactment of a law\ncompelling railroad companies to respect the rights of travelers. Hon.\nCharles Francis Adams performed signal service in the Massachusetts\nlegislature, in bringing this reformation; and to him the colored\ncitizens of that state are deeply indebted.\n\nAlthough often annoyed, and sometimes outraged, by this prejudice\nagainst color, I am indebted to it for many passages of quiet amusement.\nA half-cured subject of it is sometimes driven into awkward straits,\nespecially if he happens to get a genuine specimen of the race into his\nhouse.{311}\n\nIn the summer of 1843, I was traveling and lecturing, in company with\nWilliam A. White, Esq., through the state of Indiana. Anti-slavery\nfriends were not very abundant in Indiana, at that time, and beds were\nnot more plentiful than friends. We often slept out, in preference\nto sleeping in the houses, at some points. At the close of one of our\nmeetings, we were invited home with a kindly-disposed old farmer, who,\nin the generous enthusiasm of the moment, seemed to have forgotten that\nhe had but one spare bed, and that his guests were an ill-matched pair.\nAll went on pretty well, till near bed time, when signs of uneasiness\nbegan to show themselves, among the unsophisticated sons and daughters.\nWhite is remarkably fine looking, and very evidently a born gentleman;\nthe idea of putting us in the same bed was hardly to be tolerated; and\nyet, there we were, and but the one bed for us, and that, by the way,\nwas in the same room occupied by the other members of the family. White,\nas well as I, perceived the difficulty, for yonder slept the old folks,\nthere the sons, and a little farther along slept the daughters; and\nbut one other bed remained. Who should have this bed, was the puzzling\nquestion. There was some whispering between the old folks, some confused\nlooks among the young, as the time for going to bed approached.\nAfter witnessing the confusion as long as I liked, I relieved the\nkindly-disposed family by playfully saying, “Friend White, having got\nentirely rid of my prejudice against color, I think, as a proof of it,\nI must allow you to sleep with me to-night.” White kept up the joke, by\nseeming to esteem himself the favored party, and thus the difficulty was\nremoved. If we went to a hotel, and called for dinner, the landlord was\nsure to set one table for White and another for me, always taking him to\nbe master, and me the servant. Large eyes were generally made when the\norder was given to remove the dishes from my table to that of White’s.\nIn those days, it was thought strange that a white man and a colored\nman could dine peaceably at the same table, and in some parts the\nstrangeness of such a sight has not entirely subsided.\n\nSome people will have it that there is a natural, an inherent, and{312}\nan invincible repugnance in the breast of the white race toward\ndark-colored people; and some very intelligent colored men think that\ntheir proscription is owing solely to the color which nature has given\nthem. They hold that they are rated according to their color, and that\nit is impossible for white people ever to look upon dark races of\nmen, or men belonging to the African race, with other than feelings\nof aversion. My experience, both serious and mirthful, combats this\nconclusion. Leaving out of sight, for a moment, grave facts, to this\npoint, I will state one or two, which illustrate a very interesting\nfeature of American character as well as American prejudice. Riding from\nBoston to Albany, a few years ago, I found myself in a large car, well\nfilled with passengers. The seat next to me was about the only vacant\none. At every stopping place we took in new passengers, all of whom,\non reaching the seat next to me, cast a disdainful glance upon it, and\npassed to another car, leaving me in the full enjoyment of a hole form.\nFor a time, I did not know but that my riding there was prejudicial to\nthe interest of the railroad company. A circumstance occurred, however,\nwhich gave me an elevated position at once. Among the passengers on this\ntrain was Gov. George N. Briggs. I was not acquainted with him, and had\nno idea that I was known to him, however, I was, for upon observing me,\nthe governor left his place, and making his way toward me, respectfully\nasked the privilege of a seat by my side; and upon introducing himself,\nwe entered into a conversation very pleasant and instructive to me. The\ndespised seat now became honored. His excellency had removed all the\nprejudice against sitting by the side of a Negro; and upon his leaving\nit, as he did, on reaching Pittsfield, there were at least one dozen\napplicants for the place. The governor had, without changing my skin a\nsingle shade, made the place respectable which before was despicable.\n\nA similar incident happened to me once on the Boston and New Bedford\nrailroad, and the leading party to it has since been governor of the\nstate of Massachusetts. I allude to Col. John Henry{313} Clifford. Lest\nthe reader may fancy I am aiming to elevate myself, by claiming too much\nintimacy with great men, I must state that my only acquaintance with\nCol. Clifford was formed while I was _his hired servant_, during the\nfirst winter of my escape from slavery. I owe it him to say, that\nin that relation I found him always kind and gentlemanly. But to the\nincident. I entered a car at Boston, for New Bedford, which, with the\nexception of a single seat was full, and found I must occupy this, or\nstand up, during the journey. Having no mind to do this, I stepped up to\nthe man having the next seat, and who had a few parcels on the seat, and\ngently asked leave to take a seat by his side. My fellow-passenger gave\nme a look made up of reproach and indignation, and asked me why I should\ncome to that particular seat. I assured him, in the gentlest manner,\nthat of all others this was the seat for me. Finding that I was actually\nabout to sit down, he sang out, “O! stop, stop! and let me get out!”\n Suiting the action to the word, up the agitated man got, and sauntered\nto the other end of the car, and was compelled to stand for most of\nthe way thereafter. Halfway to New Bedford, or more, Col. Clifford,\nrecognizing me, left his seat, and not having seen me before since I had\nceased to wait on him (in everything except hard arguments against his\npro-slavery position), apparently forgetful of his rank, manifested,\nin greeting me, something of the feeling of an old friend. This\ndemonstration was not lost on the gentleman whose dignity I had, an hour\nbefore, most seriously offended. Col. Clifford was known to be about\nthe most aristocratic gentleman in Bristol county; and it was evidently\nthought that I must be somebody, else I should not have been thus\nnoticed, by a person so distinguished. Sure enough, after Col. Clifford\nleft me, I found myself surrounded with friends; and among the number,\nmy offended friend stood nearest, and with an apology for his rudeness,\nwhich I could not resist, although it was one of the lamest ever\noffered. With such facts as these before me--and I have many of them--I\nam inclined to think that pride and fashion have much to do with{314}\nthe treatment commonly extended to colored people in the United States.\nI once heard a very plain man say (and he was cross-eyed, and awkwardly\nflung together in other respects) that he should be a handsome man when\npublic opinion shall be changed.\n\nSince I have been editing and publishing a journal devoted to the\ncause of liberty and progress, I have had my mind more directed to the\ncondition and circumstances of the free colored people than when I was\nthe agent of an abolition society. The result has been a corresponding\nchange in the disposition of my time and labors. I have felt it to be\na part of my mission--under a gracious Providence to impress my sable\nbrothers in this country with the conviction that, notwithstanding the\nten thousand discouragements and the powerful hinderances, which beset\ntheir existence in this country--notwithstanding the blood-written\nhistory of Africa, and her children, from whom we have descended, or the\nclouds and darkness (whose stillness and gloom are made only more awful\nby wrathful thunder and lightning) now overshadowing them--progress is\nyet possible, and bright skies shall yet shine upon their pathway; and\nthat “Ethiopia shall yet reach forth her hand unto God.”\n\nBelieving that one of the best means of emancipating the slaves of the\nsouth is to improve and elevate the character of the free colored people\nof the north I shall labor in the future, as I have labored in the past,\nto promote the moral, social, religious, and intellectual elevation of\nthe free colored people; never forgetting my own humble orgin(sic), nor\nrefusing, while Heaven lends me ability, to use my voice, my pen, or\nmy vote, to advocate the great and primary work of the universal and\nunconditional emancipation of my entire race.\n\n\n\n\n\nRECEPTION SPEECH [10]. At Finsbury Chapel, Moorfields, England, May 12,\n1846\n\n\nMr. Douglass rose amid loud cheers, and said: I feel exceedingly glad of\nthe opportunity now afforded me of presenting the claims of my brethren\nin bonds in the United States, to so many in London and from various\nparts of Britain, who have assembled here on the present occasion. I\nhave nothing to commend me to your consideration in the way of learning,\nnothing in the way of education, to entitle me to your attention; and\nyou are aware that slavery is a very bad school for rearing teachers of\nmorality and religion. Twenty-one years of my life have been spent in\nslavery--personal slavery--surrounded by degrading influences, such\nas can exist nowhere beyond the pale of slavery; and it will not be\nstrange, if under such circumstances, I should betray, in what I have\nto say to you, a deficiency of that refinement which is seldom or ever\nfound, except among persons that have experienced superior advantages to\nthose which I have enjoyed. But I will take it for granted that you know\nsomething about the degrading influences of slavery, and that you will\nnot expect great things from me this evening, but simply such facts as I\nmay be able to advance immediately in connection with my own experience\nof slavery.\n\nNow, what is this system of slavery? This is the subject of my lecture\nthis evening--what is the character of this institution? I am about\nto answer the inquiry, what is American slavery? I do this the more\nreadily, since I have found persons in this country who have identified\nthe term slavery with that which I think it is not, and in some\ninstances, I have feared, in so doing, have rather (unwittingly, I\nknow) detracted much from the horror with which the term slavery is\ncontemplated. It is common{318} in this country to distinguish every bad\nthing by the name of slavery. Intemperance is slavery; to be deprived of\nthe right to vote is slavery, says one; to have to work hard is slavery,\nsays another; and I do not know but that if we should let them go on,\nthey would say that to eat when we are hungry, to walk when we desire to\nhave exercise, or to minister to our necessities, or have necessities at\nall, is slavery. I do not wish for a moment to detract from the horror\nwith which the evil of intemperance is contemplated--not at all; nor do\nI wish to throw the slightest obstruction in the way of any political\nfreedom that any class of persons in this country may desire to obtain.\nBut I am here to say that I think the term slavery is sometimes abused\nby identifying it with that which it is not. Slavery in the United\nStates is the granting of that power by which one man exercises and\nenforces a right of property in the body and soul of another. The\ncondition of a slave is simply that of the brute beast. He is a piece\nof property--a marketable commodity, in the language of the law, to be\nbought or sold at the will and caprice of the master who claims him to\nbe his property; he is spoken of, thought of, and treated as property.\nHis own good, his conscience, his intellect, his affections, are all set\naside by the master. The will and the wishes of the master are the law\nof the slave. He is as much a piece of property as a horse. If he is\nfed, he is fed because he is property. If he is clothed, it is with a\nview to the increase of his value as property. Whatever of comfort is\nnecessary to him for his body or soul that is inconsistent with his\nbeing property, is carefully wrested from him, not only by public\nopinion, but by the law of the country. He is carefully deprived of\neverything that tends in the slightest degree to detract from his\nvalue as property. He is deprived of education. God has given him an\nintellect; the slaveholder declares it shall not be cultivated. If\nhis moral perception leads him in a course contrary to his value\nas property, the slaveholder declares he shall not exercise it. The\nmarriage institution cannot exist among slaves, and one-sixth of the\npopulation of democratic America is denied its privileges by the law\nof the land. What is to be thought of a nation boasting of its liberty,\nboasting of its humanity, boasting of its Christianity, boasting of its\nlove of justice and purity, and yet having within its own borders three\nmillions of persons denied by law the right of marriage?--what must be\nthe condition of that people? I need not lift up the veil by giving you\nany experience of my own. Every one that can put two ideas together,\nmust see the most fearful results from such a state of things as I\nhave just mentioned. If any of these three millions find for themselves\ncompanions, and prove themselves honest, upright, virtuous persons to\neach other, yet in these{319} cases--few as I am bound to confess they\nare--the virtuous live in constant apprehension of being torn asunder\nby the merciless men-stealers that claim them as their property. This\nis American slavery; no marriage--no education--the light of the gospel\nshut out from the dark mind of the bondman--and he forbidden by law to\nlearn to read. If a mother shall teach her children to read, the law in\nLouisiana proclaims that she may be hanged by the neck. If the father\nattempt to give his son a knowledge of letters, he may be punished by\nthe whip in one instance, and in another be killed, at the discretion\nof the court. Three millions of people shut out from the light of\nknowledge! It is easy for you to conceive the evil that must result from\nsuch a state of things.\n\nI now come to the physical evils of slavery. I do not wish to dwell at\nlength upon these, but it seems right to speak of them, not so much to\ninfluence your minds on this question, as to let the slaveholders of\nAmerica know that the curtain which conceals their crimes is being\nlifted abroad; that we are opening the dark cell, and leading the\npeople into the horrible recesses of what they are pleased to call their\ndomestic institution. We want them to know that a knowledge of their\nwhippings, their scourgings, their brandings, their chainings, is not\nconfined to their plantations, but that some Negro of theirs has broken\nloose from his chains--has burst through the dark incrustation of\nslavery, and is now exposing their deeds of deep damnation to the gaze\nof the christian people of England.\n\nThe slaveholders resort to all kinds of cruelty. If I were disposed,\nI have matter enough to interest you on this question for five or six\nevenings, but I will not dwell at length upon these cruelties. Suffice\nit to say, that all of the peculiar modes of torture that were resorted\nto in the West India islands, are resorted to, I believe, even more\nfrequently, in the United States of America. Starvation, the\nbloody whip, the chain, the gag, the thumb-screw, cat-hauling, the\ncat-o’-nine-tails, the dungeon, the blood-hound, are all in requisition\nto keep the slave in his condition as a slave in the United States. If\nany one has a doubt upon this point, I would ask him to read the chapter\non slavery in Dickens’s _Notes on America_. If any man has a doubt upon\nit, I have here the “testimony of a thousand witnesses,” which I can\ngive at any length, all going to prove the truth of my statement.\nThe blood-hound is regularly trained in the United States, and\nadvertisements are to be found in the southern papers of the Union, from\npersons advertising themselves as blood-hound trainers, and offering to\nhunt down slaves at fifteen dollars a piece, recommending their\nhounds as the fleetest in the neighborhood, never known to fail.{320}\nAdvertisements are from time to time inserted, stating that slaves have\nescaped with iron collars about their necks, with bands of iron about\ntheir feet, marked with the lash, branded with red-hot irons, the\ninitials of their master’s name burned into their flesh; and the masters\nadvertise the fact of their being thus branded with their own signature,\nthereby proving to the world, that, however damning it may appear to\nnon-slavers, such practices are not regarded discreditable among the\nslaveholders themselves. Why, I believe if a man should brand his horse\nin this country--burn the initials of his name into any of his cattle,\nand publish the ferocious deed here--that the united execrations of\nChristians in Britain would descend upon him. Yet in the United States,\nhuman beings are thus branded. As Whittier says--\n\n           ... _Our countrymen in chains,\n            The whip on woman’s shrinking flesh,\n            Our soil yet reddening with the stains\n            Caught from her scourgings warm and fresh_.\n\n\nThe slave-dealer boldly publishes his infamous acts to the world. Of all\nthings that have been said of slavery to which exception has been taken\nby slaveholders, this, the charge of cruelty, stands foremost, and yet\nthere is no charge capable of clearer demonstration, than that of the\nmost barbarous inhumanity on the part of the slaveholders toward their\nslaves. And all this is necessary; it is necessary to resort to these\ncruelties, in order to _make the slave a slave_, and to _keep him a\nslave_. Why, my experience all goes to prove the truth of what you will\ncall a marvelous proposition, that the better you treat a slave, the\nmore you destroy his value _as a slave_, and enhance the probability of\nhis eluding the grasp of the slaveholder; the more kindly you treat him,\nthe more wretched you make him, while you keep him in the condition of\na slave. My experience, I say, confirms the truth of this proposition.\nWhen I was treated exceedingly ill; when my back was being scourged\ndaily; when I was whipped within an inch of my life--_life_ was all I\ncared for. “Spare my life,” was my continual prayer. When I was looking\nfor the blow about to be inflicted upon my head, I was not thinking\nof my liberty; it was my life. But, as soon as the blow was not to be\nfeared, then came the longing for liberty. If a slave has a bad master,\nhis ambition is to get a better; when he gets a better, he aspires\nto have the best; and when he gets the best, he aspires to be his own\nmaster. But the slave must be brutalized to keep him as a slave. The\nslaveholder feels this necessity. I admit this necessity. If it be right\nto hold slaves at all, it is right to hold{321} them in the only way in\nwhich they can be held; and this can be done only by shutting out the\nlight of education from their minds, and brutalizing their persons. The\nwhip, the chain, the gag, the thumb-screw, the blood-hound, the\nstocks, and all the other bloody paraphernalia of the slave system, are\nindispensably necessary to the relation of master and slave. The slave\nmust be subjected to these, or he ceases to be a slave. Let him know\nthat the whip is burned; that the fetters have been turned to some\nuseful and profitable employment; that the chain is no longer for his\nlimbs; that the blood-hound is no longer to be put upon his track; that\nhis master’s authority over him is no longer to be enforced by taking\nhis life--and immediately he walks out from the house of bondage and\nasserts his freedom as a man. The slaveholder finds it necessary to have\nthese implements to keep the slave in bondage; finds it necessary to\nbe able to say, “Unless you do so and so; unless you do as I bid you--I\nwill take away your life!”\n\nSome of the most awful scenes of cruelty are constantly taking place in\nthe middle states of the Union. We have in those states what are called\nthe slave-breeding states. Allow me to speak plainly. Although it is\nharrowing to your feelings, it is necessary that the facts of the case\nshould be stated. We have in the United States slave-breeding states.\nThe very state from which the minister from our court to yours comes, is\none of these states--Maryland, where men, women, and children are reared\nfor the market, just as horses, sheep, and swine are raised for the\nmarket. Slave-rearing is there looked upon as a legitimate trade; the\nlaw sanctions it, public opinion upholds it, the church does not condemn\nit. It goes on in all its bloody horrors, sustained by the auctioneer’s\nblock. If you would see the cruelties of this system, hear the following\nnarrative. Not long since the following scene occurred. A slave-woman\nand a slaveman had united themselves as man and wife in the absence of\nany law to protect them as man and wife. They had lived together by the\npermission, not by right, of their master, and they had reared a family.\nThe master found it expedient, and for his interest, to sell them. He\ndid not ask them their wishes in regard to the matter at all; they were\nnot consulted. The man and woman were brought to the auctioneer’s block,\nunder the sound of the hammer. The cry was raised, “Here goes; who bids\ncash?” Think of it--a man and wife to be sold! The woman was placed\non the auctioneer’s block; her limbs, as is customary, were brutally\nexposed to the purchasers, who examined her with all the freedom with\nwhich they would examine a horse. There stood the husband, powerless; no\nright to his wife; the master’s right preeminent. She was sold. He was\nnext{322} brought to the auctioneer’s block. His eyes followed his wife\nin the distance; and he looked beseechingly, imploringly, to the man\nthat had bought his wife, to buy him also. But he was at length bid\noff to another person. He was about to be separated forever from her\nhe loved. No word of his, no work of his, could save him from this\nseparation. He asked permission of his new master to go and take the\nhand of his wife at parting. It was denied him. In the agony of his soul\nhe rushed from the man who had just bought him, that he might take a\nfarewell of his wife; but his way was obstructed, he was struck over the\nhead with a loaded whip, and was held for a moment; but his agony was\ntoo great. When he was let go, he fell a corpse at the feet of his\nmaster. His heart was broken. Such scenes are the everyday fruits of\nAmerican slavery. Some two years since, the Hon. Seth. M. Gates, an\nanti-slavery gentleman of the state of New York, a representative in\nthe congress of the United States, told me he saw with his own eyes\nthe following circumstances. In the national District of Columbia, over\nwhich the star-spangled emblem is constantly waving, where orators\nare ever holding forth on the subject of American liberty, American\ndemocracy, American republicanism, there are two slave prisons. When\ngoing across a bridge, leading to one of these prisons, he saw a\nyoung woman run out, bare-footed and bare-headed, and with very little\nclothing on. She was running with all speed to the bridge he was\napproaching. His eye was fixed upon her, and he stopped to see what was\nthe matter. He had not paused long before he saw three men run out after\nher. He now knew what the nature of the case was; a slave escaping from\nher chains--a young woman, a sister--escaping from the bondage in which\nshe had been held. She made her way to the bridge, but had not reached,\nere from the Virginia side there came two slaveholders. As soon as they\nsaw them, her pursuers called out, “Stop her!” True to their Virginian\ninstincts, they came to the rescue of their brother kidnappers, across\nthe bridge. The poor girl now saw that there was no chance for her.\nIt was a trying time. She knew if she went back, she must be a slave\nforever--she must be dragged down to the scenes of pollution which the\nslaveholders continually provide for most of the poor, sinking, wretched\nyoung women, whom they call their property. She formed her resolution;\nand just as those who were about to take her, were going to put hands\nupon her, to drag her back, she leaped over the balustrades of the\nbridge, and down she went to rise no more. She chose death, rather than\nto go back into the hands of those christian slaveholders from whom she\nhad escaped.\n\nCan it be possible that such things as these exist in the United\nStates?{323} Are not these the exceptions? Are any such scenes as this\ngeneral? Are not such deeds condemned by the law and denounced by public\nopinion? Let me read to you a few of the laws of the slaveholding states\nof America. I think no better exposure of slavery can be made than is\nmade by the laws of the states in which slavery exists. I prefer reading\nthe laws to making any statement in confirmation of what I have said\nmyself; for the slaveholders cannot object to this testimony, since it\nis the calm, the cool, the deliberate enactment of their wisest heads,\nof their most clear-sighted, their own constituted representatives. “If\nmore than seven slaves together are found in any road without a white\nperson, twenty lashes a piece; for visiting a plantation without a\nwritten pass, ten lashes; for letting loose a boat from where it is\nmade fast, thirty-nine lashes for the first offense; and for the second,\nshall have cut off from his head one ear; for keeping or carrying a\nclub, thirty-nine lashes; for having any article for sale, without a\nticket from his master, ten lashes; for traveling in any other than the\nmost usual and accustomed road, when going alone to any place, forty\nlashes; for traveling in the night without a pass, forty lashes.” I am\nafraid you do not understand the awful character of these lashes. You\nmust bring it before your mind. A human being in a perfect state of\nnudity, tied hand and foot to a stake, and a strong man standing behind\nwith a heavy whip, knotted at the end, each blow cutting into the flesh,\nand leaving the warm blood dripping to the feet; and for these trifles.\n“For being found in another person’s negro-quarters, forty lashes; for\nhunting with dogs in the woods, thirty lashes; for being on horseback\nwithout the written permission of his master, twenty-five lashes; for\nriding or going abroad in the night, or riding horses in the day time,\nwithout leave, a slave may be whipped, cropped, or branded in the cheek\nwith the letter R. or otherwise punished, such punishment not extending\nto life, or so as to render him unfit for labor.” The laws referred to,\nmay be found by consulting _Brevard’s Digest; Haywood’s Manual; Virginia\nRevised Code; Prince’s Digest; Missouri Laws; Mississippi Revised Code_.\nA man, for going to visit his brethren, without the permission of his\nmaster--and in many instances he may not have that permission; his\nmaster, from caprice or other reasons, may not be willing to allow\nit--may be caught on his way, dragged to a post, the branding-iron\nheated, and the name of his master or the letter R branded into his\ncheek or on his forehead. They treat slaves thus, on the principle that\nthey must punish for light offenses, in order to prevent the commission\nof larger ones. I wish you to mark that in the single state of Virginia\nthere are seventy-one crimes for which a colored man may be executed;\nwhile there are only three of{324} these crimes, which, when committed\nby a white man, will subject him to that punishment. There are many of\nthese crimes which if the white man did not commit, he would be regarded\nas a scoundrel and a coward. In the state of Maryland, there is a law to\nthis effect: that if a slave shall strike his master, he may be hanged,\nhis head severed from his body, his body quartered, and his head and\nquarters set up in the most prominent places in the neighborhood. If a\ncolored woman, in the defense of her own virtue, in defense of her own\nperson, should shield herself from the brutal attacks of her tyrannical\nmaster, or make the slightest resistance, she may be killed on the spot.\nNo law whatever will bring the guilty man to justice for the crime.\n\nBut you will ask me, can these things be possible in a land professing\nChristianity? Yes, they are so; and this is not the worst. No; a darker\nfeature is yet to be presented than the mere existence of these facts.\nI have to inform you that the religion of the southern states, at\nthis time, is the great supporter, the great sanctioner of the bloody\natrocities to which I have referred. While America is printing tracts\nand bibles; sending missionaries abroad to convert the heathen;\nexpending her money in various ways for the promotion of the gospel in\nforeign lands--the slave not only lies forgotten, uncared for, but is\ntrampled under foot by the very churches of the land. What have we in\nAmerica? Why, we have slavery made part of the religion of the land.\nYes, the pulpit there stands up as the great defender of this cursed\n_institution_, as it is called. Ministers of religion come forward and\ntorture the hallowed pages of inspired wisdom to sanction the bloody\ndeed. They stand forth as the foremost, the strongest defenders of this\n“institution.” As a proof of this, I need not do more than state the\ngeneral fact, that slavery has existed under the droppings of the\nsanctuary of the south for the last two hundred years, and there has\nnot been any war between the _religion_ and the _slavery_ of the south.\nWhips, chains, gags, and thumb-screws have all lain under the droppings\nof the sanctuary, and instead of rusting from off the limbs of the\nbondman, those droppings have served to preserve them in all their\nstrength. Instead of preaching the gospel against this tyranny, rebuke,\nand wrong, ministers of religion have sought, by all and every means, to\nthrow in the back-ground whatever in the bible could be construed\ninto opposition to slavery, and to bring forward that which they could\ntorture into its support. This I conceive to be the darkest feature of\nslavery, and the most difficult to attack, because it is identified with\nreligion, and exposes those who denounce it to the charge of infidelity.\nYes, those with whom I have been laboring, namely, the old{325}\norganization anti-slavery society of America, have been again and again\nstigmatized as infidels, and for what reason? Why, solely in consequence\nof the faithfulness of their attacks upon the slaveholding religion of\nthe southern states, and the northern religion that sympathizes with it.\nI have found it difficult to speak on this matter without persons coming\nforward and saying, “Douglass, are you not afraid of injuring the\ncause of Christ? You do not desire to do so, we know; but are you not\nundermining religion?” This has been said to me again and again, even\nsince I came to this country, but I cannot be induced to leave off\nthese exposures. I love the religion of our blessed Savior. I love that\nreligion that comes from above, in the “wisdom of God,” which is first\npure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy\nand good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. I love that\nreligion that sends its votaries to bind up the wounds of him that has\nfallen among thieves. I love that religion that makes it the duty of its\ndisciples to visit the father less and the widow in their affliction. I\nlove that religion that is based upon the glorious principle, of love\nto God and love to man; which makes its followers do unto others as they\nthemselves would be done by. If you demand liberty to yourself, it says,\ngrant it to your neighbors. If you claim a right to think for yourself,\nit says, allow your neighbors the same right. If you claim to act for\nyourself, it says, allow your neighbors the same right. It is because I\nlove this religion that I hate the slaveholding, the woman-whipping, the\nmind-darkening, the soul-destroying religion that exists in the southern\nstates of America. It is because I regard the one as good, and pure, and\nholy, that I cannot but regard the other as bad, corrupt, and wicked.\nLoving the one I must hate the other; holding to the one I must reject\nthe other.\n\nI may be asked, why I am so anxious to bring this subject before the\nBritish public--why I do not confine my efforts to the United States? My\nanswer is, first, that slavery is the common enemy of mankind, and all\nmankind should be made acquainted with its abominable character. My next\nanswer is, that the slave is a man, and, as such, is entitled to your\nsympathy as a brother. All the feelings, all the susceptibilities,\nall the capacities, which you have, he has. He is a part of the human\nfamily. He has been the prey--the common prey--of Christendom for the\nlast three hundred years, and it is but right, it is but just, it is\nbut proper, that his wrongs should be known throughout the world. I have\nanother reason for bringing this matter before the British public, and\nit is this: slavery is a system of wrong, so blinding to all around, so\nhardening to the heart, so corrupting to the morals, so deleterious\nto religion, so{326} sapping to all the principles of justice in its\nimmediate vicinity, that the community surrounding it lack the moral\nstamina necessary to its removal. It is a system of such gigantic evil,\nso strong, so overwhelming in its power, that no one nation is equal to\nits removal. It requires the humanity of Christianity, the morality of\nthe world to remove it. Hence, I call upon the people of Britain to\nlook at this matter, and to exert the influence I am about to show they\npossess, for the removal of slavery from America. I can appeal to them,\nas strongly by their regard for the slaveholder as for the slave, to\nlabor in this cause. I am here, because you have an influence on America\nthat no other nation can have. You have been drawn together by the power\nof steam to a marvelous extent; the distance between London and\nBoston is now reduced to some twelve or fourteen days, so that the\ndenunciations against slavery, uttered in London this week, may be heard\nin a fortnight in the streets of Boston, and reverberating amidst the\nhills of Massachusetts. There is nothing said here against slavery that\nwill not be recorded in the United States. I am here, also, because the\nslaveholders do not want me to be here; they would rather that I were\nnot here. I have adopted a maxim laid down by Napoleon, never to occupy\nground which the enemy would like me to occupy. The slaveholders would\nmuch rather have me, if I will denounce slavery, denounce it in the\nnorthern states, where their friends and supporters are, who will stand\nby and mob me for denouncing it. They feel something as the man felt,\nwhen he uttered his prayer, in which he made out a most horrible case\nfor himself, and one of his neighbors touched him and said, “My\nfriend, I always had the opinion of you that you have now expressed for\nyourself--that you are a very great sinner.” Coming from himself, it\nwas all very well, but coming from a stranger it was rather cutting. The\nslaveholders felt that when slavery was denounced among themselves, it\nwas not so bad; but let one of the slaves get loose, let him summon\nthe people of Britain, and make known to them the conduct of the\nslaveholders toward their slaves, and it cuts them to the quick, and\nproduces a sensation such as would be produced by nothing else. The\npower I exert now is something like the power that is exerted by the man\nat the end of the lever; my influence now is just in proportion to the\ndistance that I am from the United States. My exposure of slavery abroad\nwill tell more upon the hearts and consciences of slaveholders, than\nif I was attacking them in America; for almost every paper that I now\nreceive from the United States, comes teeming with statements about this\nfugitive Negro, calling him a “glib-tongued scoundrel,” and saying that\nhe is running out against the institutions and people of America. I\ndeny the charge that I am saying a word against the institutions of\nAmerica,{327} or the people, as such. What I have to say is against\nslavery and slaveholders. I feel at liberty to speak on this subject.\nI have on my back the marks of the lash; I have four sisters and one\nbrother now under the galling chain. I feel it my duty to cry aloud\nand spare not. I am not averse to having the good opinion of my fellow\ncreatures. I am not averse to being kindly regarded by all men; but I\nam bound, even at the hazard of making a large class of religionists in\nthis country hate me, oppose me, and malign me as they have done--I am\nbound by the prayers, and tears, and entreaties of three millions of\nkneeling bondsmen, to have no compromise with men who are in any shape\nor form connected with the slaveholders of America. I expose slavery\nin this country, because to expose it is to kill it. Slavery is one of\nthose monsters of darkness to whom the light of truth is death. Expose\nslavery, and it dies. Light is to slavery what the heat of the sun is to\nthe root of a tree; it must die under it. All the slaveholder asks of\nme is silence. He does not ask me to go abroad and preach _in favor_\nof slavery; he does not ask any one to do that. He would not say that\nslavery is a good thing, but the best under the circumstances. The\nslaveholders want total darkness on the subject. They want the hatchway\nshut down, that the monster may crawl in his den of darkness, crushing\nhuman hopes and happiness, destroying the bondman at will, and having no\none to reprove or rebuke him. Slavery shrinks from the light; it\nhateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest its deeds should be\nreproved. To tear off the mask from this abominable system, to expose\nit to the light of heaven, aye, to the heat of the sun, that it may burn\nand wither it out of existence, is my object in coming to this country.\nI want the slaveholder surrounded, as by a wall of anti-slavery fire, so\nthat he may see the condemnation of himself and his system glaring\ndown in letters of light. I want him to feel that he has no sympathy\nin England, Scotland, or Ireland; that he has none in Canada, none\nin Mexico, none among the poor wild Indians; that the voice of\nthe civilized, aye, and savage world is against him. I would have\ncondemnation blaze down upon him in every direction, till, stunned and\noverwhelmed with shame and confusion, he is compelled to let go the\ngrasp he holds upon the persons of his victims, and restore them to\ntheir long-lost rights.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Campbell’s Reply\n\n\nFrom Rev. Dr. Campbell’s brilliant reply we extract the following:\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS, “the beast of burden,” the portion of “goods and\nchattels,” the representative of three millions of men, has been\nraised{328} up! Shall I say the _man?_ If there is a man on earth, he is\na man. My blood boiled within me when I heard his address tonight, and\nthought that he had left behind him three millions of such men.\n\nWe must see more of this man; we must have more of this man. One would\nhave taken a voyage round the globe some forty years back--especially\nsince the introduction of steam--to have heard such an exposure of\nslavery from the lips of a slave. It will be an era in the individual\nhistory of the present assembly. Our children--our boys and girls--I\nhave tonight seen the delightful sympathy of their hearts evinced\nby their heaving breasts, while their eyes sparkled with wonder and\nadmiration, that this black man--this slave--had so much logic, so much\nwit, so much fancy, so much eloquence. He was something more than a man,\naccording to their little notions. Then, I say, we must hear him again.\nWe have got a purpose to accomplish. He has appealed to the pulpit of\nEngland. The English pulpit is with him. He has appealed to the press of\nEngland; the press of England is conducted by English hearts, and that\npress will do him justice. About ten days hence, and his second master,\nwho may well prize “such a piece of goods,” will have the pleasure of\nreading his burning words, and his first master will bless himself that\nhe has got quit of him. We have to create public opinion, or rather, not\nto create it, for it is created already; but we have to foster it; and\nwhen tonight I heard those magnificent words--the words of Curran, by\nwhich my heart, from boyhood, has ofttimes been deeply moved--I rejoice\nto think that they embody an instinct of an Englishman’s nature. I\nheard, with inexpressible delight, how they told on this mighty mass of\nthe citizens of the metropolis.\n\nBritain has now no slaves; we can therefore talk to the other nations\nnow, as we could not have talked a dozen years ago. I want the whole of\nthe London ministry to meet Douglass. For as his appeal is to England,\nand throughout England, I should rejoice in the idea of churchmen and\ndissenters merging all sectional distinctions in this cause. Let us have\na public breakfast. Let the ministers meet him; let them hear him; let\nthem grasp his hand; and let him enlist their sympathies on behalf of\nthe slave. Let him inspire them with abhorrence of the man-stealer--the\nslaveholder. No slaveholding American shall ever my cross my door.\nNo slaveholding or slavery-supporting minister shall ever pollute my\npulpit. While I have a tongue to speak, or a hand to write, I will,\nto the utmost of my power, oppose these slaveholding men. We must have\nDouglass amongst us to aid in fostering public opinion.\n\nThe great conflict with slavery must now take place in America; and{329}\nwhile they are adding other slave states to the Union, our business\nis to step forward and help the abolitionists there. It is a pleasing\ncircumstance that such a body of men has risen in America, and whilst we\nhurl our thunders against her slavers, let us make a distinction between\nthose who advocate slavery and those who oppose it. George Thompson has\nbeen there. This man, Frederick Douglass, has been there, and has been\ncompelled to flee. I wish, when he first set foot on our shores, he had\nmade a solemn vow, and said, “Now that I am free, and in the sanctuary\nof freedom, I will never return till I have seen the emancipation of my\ncountry completed.” He wants to surround these men, the slaveholders,\nas by a wall of fire; and he himself may do much toward kindling it.\nLet him travel over the island--east, west, north, and south--everywhere\ndiffusing knowledge and awakening principle, till the whole nation\nbecome a body of petitioners to America. He will, he must, do it. He\nmust for a season make England his home. He must send for his wife. He\nmust send for his children. I want to see the sons and daughters of\nsuch a sire. We, too, must do something for him and them worthy of the\nEnglish name. I do not like the idea of a man of such mental dimensions,\nsuch moral courage, and all but incomparable talent, having his own\nsmall wants, and the wants of a distant wife and children, supplied by\nthe poor profits of his publication, the sketch of his life. Let the\npamphlet be bought by tens of thousands. But we will do something more\nfor him, shall we not?\n\nIt only remains that we pass a resolution of thanks to Frederick\nDouglass, the slave that was, the man that is! He that was covered with\nchains, and that is now being covered with glory, and whom we will send\nback a gentleman.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER TO HIS OLD MASTER. [11]. To My Old Master, Thomas Auld\n\n\nSIR--The long and intimate, though by no means friendly, relation which\nunhappily subsisted between you and myself, leads me to hope that you\nwill easily account for the great liberty which I now take in addressing\nyou in this open and public manner. The same fact may remove any\ndisagreeable surprise which you may experience on again finding your\nname coupled with mine, in any other way than in an advertisement,\naccurately describing my person, and offering a large sum for my arrest.\nIn thus dragging you again before the public, I am aware that I shall\nsubject myself to no inconsiderable amount of censure. I shall probably\nbe charged with an unwarrantable, if not a wanton and reckless disregard\nof the rights and properties of private life. There are those north as\nwell as south who entertain a much higher respect for rights which are\nmerely conventional, than they do for rights which are personal and\nessential. Not a few there are in our country, who, while they have no\nscruples against robbing the laborer of the hard earned results of his\npatient industry, will be shocked by the extremely indelicate manner of\nbringing your name before the public. Believing this to be the case, and\nwishing to meet every reasonable or plausible objection to my conduct,\nI will frankly state the ground upon which I justfy(sic) myself in this\ninstance, as well as on former occasions when I have thought proper to\nmention your name in public. All will agree that a man guilty of theft,\nrobbery, or murder, has forfeited the right to concealment and private\nlife; that the community have a right to subject such persons to the\nmost complete exposure. However much they may desire retirement, and\naim to conceal themselves and their movements from the popular gaze,\nthe public have a right to ferret them out, and bring their conduct\nbefore{331} the proper tribunals of the country for investigation. Sir,\nyou will undoubtedly make the proper application of these generally\nadmitted principles, and will easily see the light in which you are\nregarded by me; I will not therefore manifest ill temper, by calling you\nhard names. I know you to be a man of some intelligence, and can readily\ndetermine the precise estimate which I entertain of your character. I\nmay therefore indulge in language which may seem to others indirect and\nambiguous, and yet be quite well understood by yourself.\n\nI have selected this day on which to address you, because it is the\nanniversary of my emancipation; and knowing no better way, I am led to\nthis as the best mode of celebrating that truly important events. Just\nten years ago this beautiful September morning, yon bright sun beheld me\na slave--a poor degraded chattel--trembling at the sound of your voice,\nlamenting that I was a man, and wishing myself a brute. The hopes which\nI had treasured up for weeks of a safe and successful escape from your\ngrasp, were powerfully confronted at this last hour by dark clouds of\ndoubt and fear, making my person shake and my bosom to heave with the\nheavy contest between hope and fear. I have no words to describe to you\nthe deep agony of soul which I experienced on that never-to-be-forgotten\nmorning--for I left by daylight. I was making a leap in the dark. The\nprobabilities, so far as I could by reason determine them, were stoutly\nagainst the undertaking. The preliminaries and precautions I had adopted\npreviously, all worked badly. I was like one going to war without\nweapons--ten chances of defeat to one of victory. One in whom I had\nconfided, and one who had promised me assistance, appalled by fear at\nthe trial hour, deserted me, thus leaving the responsibility of success\nor failure solely with myself. You, sir, can never know my feelings. As\nI look back to them, I can scarcely realize that I have passed through\na scene so trying. Trying, however, as they were, and gloomy as was\nthe prospect, thanks be to the Most High, who is ever the God of the\noppressed, at the moment which was to determine my whole earthly career,\nHis grace was sufficient; my mind was made up. I embraced the golden\nopportunity, took the morning tide at the flood, and a free man, young,\nactive, and strong, is the result.\n\nI have often thought I should like to explain to you the grounds upon\nwhich I have justified myself in running away from you. I am almost\nashamed to do so now, for by this time you may have discovered them\nyourself. I will, however, glance at them. When yet but a child about\nsix years old, I imbibed the determination to run away. The very first\nmental{332} effort that I now remember on my part, was an attempt to\nsolve the mystery--why am I a slave? and with this question my youthful\nmind was troubled for many days, pressing upon me more heavily at times\nthan others. When I saw the slave-driver whip a slave-woman, cut the\nblood out of her neck, and heard her piteous cries, I went away into the\ncorner of the fence, wept and pondered over the mystery. I had, through\nsome medium, I know not what, got some idea of God, the Creator of all\nmankind, the black and the white, and that he had made the blacks to\nserve the whites as slaves. How he could do this and be _good_, I\ncould not tell. I was not satisfied with this theory, which made God\nresponsible for slavery, for it pained me greatly, and I have wept over\nit long and often. At one time, your first wife, Mrs. Lucretia, heard me\nsighing and saw me shedding tears, and asked of me the matter, but I\nwas afraid to tell her. I was puzzled with this question, till one night\nwhile sitting in the kitchen, I heard some of the old slaves talking of\ntheir parents having been stolen from Africa by white men, and were sold\nhere as slaves. The whole mystery was solved at once. Very soon after\nthis, my Aunt Jinny and Uncle Noah ran away, and the great noise made\nabout it by your father-in-law, made me for the first time acquainted\nwith the fact, that there were free states as well as slave states. From\nthat time, I resolved that I would some day run away. The morality of\nthe act I dispose of as follows: I am myself; you are yourself; we are\ntwo distinct persons, equal persons. What you are, I am. You are a man,\nand so am I. God created both, and made us separate beings. I am not by\nnature bond to you, or you to me. Nature does not make your existence\ndepend upon me, or mine to depend upon yours. I cannot walk upon your\nlegs, or you upon mine. I cannot breathe for you, or you for me; I must\nbreathe for myself, and you for yourself. We are distinct persons, and\nare each equally provided with faculties necessary to our individual\nexistence. In leaving you, I took nothing but what belonged to me, and\nin no way lessened your means for obtaining an _honest_ living. Your\nfaculties remained yours, and mine became useful to their rightful\nowner. I therefore see no wrong in any part of the transaction. It is\ntrue, I went off secretly; but that was more your fault than mine. Had\nI let you into the secret, you would have defeated the enterprise\nentirely; but for this, I should have been really glad to have made you\nacquainted with my intentions to leave.\n\nYou may perhaps want to know how I like my present condition. I am free\nto say, I greatly prefer it to that which I occupied in Maryland. I\nam, however, by no means prejudiced against the state as such. Its\ngeography, climate, fertility, and products, are such as to make it\na very{333} desirable abode for any man; and but for the existence of\nslavery there, it is not impossible that I might again take up my abode\nin that state. It is not that I love Maryland less, but freedom more.\nYou will be surprised to learn that people at the north labor under the\nstrange delusion that if the slaves were emancipated at the south,\nthey would flock to the north. So far from this being the case, in\nthat event, you would see many old and familiar faces back again to the\nsouth. The fact is, there are few here who would not return to the south\nin the event of emancipation. We want to live in the land of our birth,\nand to lay our bones by the side of our fathers; and nothing short of an\nintense love of personal freedom keeps us from the south. For the sake\nof this, most of us would live on a crust of bread and a cup of cold\nwater.\n\nSince I left you, I have had a rich experience. I have occupied stations\nwhich I never dreamed of when a slave. Three out of the ten years since\nI left you, I spent as a common laborer on the wharves of New Bedford,\nMassachusetts. It was there I earned my first free dollar. It was mine.\nI could spend it as I pleased. I could buy hams or herring with it,\nwithout asking any odds of anybody. That was a precious dollar to me.\nYou remember when I used to make seven, or eight, or even nine dollars\na week in Baltimore, you would take every cent of it from me every\nSaturday night, saying that I belonged to you, and my earnings also. I\nnever liked this conduct on your part--to say the best, I thought it a\nlittle mean. I would not have served you so. But let that pass. I was a\nlittle awkward about counting money in New England fashion when I first\nlanded in New Bedford. I came near betraying myself several times. I\ncaught myself saying phip, for fourpence; and at one time a man actually\ncharged me with being a runaway, whereupon I was silly enough to become\none by running away from him, for I was greatly afraid he might adopt\nmeasures to get me again into slavery, a condition I then dreaded more\nthan death.\n\nI soon learned, however, to count money, as well as to make it, and got\non swimmingly. I married soon after leaving you; in fact, I was engaged\nto be married before I left you; and instead of finding my companion a\nburden, she was truly a helpmate. She went to live at service, and I to\nwork on the wharf, and though we toiled hard the first winter, we never\nlived more happily. After remaining in New Bedford for three years, I\nmet with William Lloyd Garrison, a person of whom you have _possibly_\nheard, as he is pretty generally known among slaveholders. He put it\ninto my head that I might make myself serviceable to the cause of the\nslave, by devoting a portion of my time to telling my own sorrows, and\nthose of other slaves, which had come under my observation. This{334}\nwas the commencement of a higher state of existence than any to which I\nhad ever aspired. I was thrown into society the most pure, enlightened,\nand benevolent, that the country affords. Among these I have\nnever forgotten you, but have invariably made you the topic of\nconversation--thus giving you all the notoriety I could do. I need not\ntell you that the opinion formed of you in these circles is far from\nbeing favorable. They have little respect for your honesty, and less for\nyour religion.\n\nBut I was going on to relate to you something of my interesting\nexperience. I had not long enjoyed the excellent society to which I\nhave referred, before the light of its excellence exerted a beneficial\ninfluence on my mind and heart. Much of my early dislike of white\npersons was removed, and their manners, habits, and customs, so\nentirely unlike what I had been used to in the kitchen-quarters on\nthe plantations of the south, fairly charmed me, and gave me a strong\ndisrelish for the coarse and degrading customs of my former condition. I\ntherefore made an effort so to improve my mind and deportment, as to be\nsomewhat fitted to the station to which I seemed almost providentially\ncalled. The transition from degradation to respectability was indeed\ngreat, and to get from one to the other without carrying some marks of\none’s former condition, is truly a difficult matter. I would not have\nyou think that I am now entirely clear of all plantation peculiarities,\nbut my friends here, while they entertain the strongest dislike to them,\nregard me with that charity to which my past life somewhat entitles me,\nso that my condition in this respect is exceedingly pleasant. So far\nas my domestic affairs are concerned, I can boast of as comfortable a\ndwelling as your own. I have an industrious and neat companion, and four\ndear children--the oldest a girl of nine years, and three fine boys, the\noldest eight, the next six, and the youngest four years old. The three\noldest are now going regularly to school--two can read and write, and\nthe other can spell, with tolerable correctness, words of two syllables.\nDear fellows! they are all in comfortable beds, and are sound asleep,\nperfectly secure under my own roof. There are no slaveholders here\nto rend my heart by snatching them from my arms, or blast a mother’s\ndearest hopes by tearing them from her bosom. These dear children are\nours--not to work up into rice, sugar, and tobacco, but to watch over,\nregard, and protect, and to rear them up in the nurture and admonition\nof the gospel--to train them up in the paths of wisdom and virtue, and,\nas far as we can, to make them useful to the world and to themselves.\nOh! sir, a slaveholder never appears to me so completely an agent of\nhell, as when I think of and look upon my dear children. It is then\nthat my feelings rise above my control. I meant to have said more with\nrespect to my own prosperity and happiness, but thoughts and feel{335}\nings which this recital has quickened, unfit me to proceed further in\nthat direction. The grim horrors of slavery rise in all their ghastly\nterror before me; the wails of millions pierce my heart and chill my\nblood. I remember the chain, the gag, the bloody whip; the death-like\ngloom overshadowing the broken spirit of the fettered bondman; the\nappalling liability of his being torn away from wife and children,\nand sold like a beast in the market. Say not that this is a picture of\nfancy. You well know that I wear stripes on my back, inflicted by your\ndirection; and that you, while we were brothers in the same church,\ncaused this right hand, with which I am now penning this letter, to be\nclosely tied to my left, and my person dragged, at the pistol’s mouth,\nfifteen miles, from the Bay Side to Easton, to be sold like a beast\nin the market, for the alleged crime of intending to escape from your\npossession. All this, and more, you remember, and know to be perfectly\ntrue, not only of yourself, but of nearly all of the slaveholders around\nyou.\n\nAt this moment, you are probably the guilty holder of at least three of\nmy own dear sisters, and my only brother, in bondage. These you regard\nas your property. They are recorded on your ledger, or perhaps have been\nsold to human flesh-mongers, with a view to filling our own ever-hungry\npurse. Sir, I desire to know how and where these dear sisters are. Have\nyou sold them? or are they still in your possession? What has become\nof them? are they living or dead? And my dear old grandmother, whom you\nturned out like an old horse to die in the woods--is she still alive?\nWrite and let me know all about them. If my grandmother be still alive,\nshe is of no service to you, for by this time she must be nearly eighty\nyears old--too old to be cared for by one to whom she has ceased to be\nof service; send her to me at Rochester, or bring her to Philadelphia,\nand it shall be the crowning happiness of my life to take care of her\nin her old age. Oh! she was to me a mother and a father, so far as hard\ntoil for my comfort could make her such. Send me my grandmother! that I\nmay watch over and take care of her in her old age. And my sisters--let\nme know all about them. I would write to them, and learn all I want to\nknow of them, without disturbing you in any way, but that, through your\nunrighteous conduct, they have been entirely deprived of the power\nto read and write. You have kept them in utter ignorance, and have\ntherefore robbed them of the sweet enjoyments of writing or receiving\nletters from absent friends and relatives. Your wickedness and cruelty,\ncommitted in this respect on your fellow-creatures, are greater than all\nthe stripes you have laid upon my back or theirs. It is an outrage upon\nthe soul, a war upon the immortal spirit, and one for which you must\ngive account at the bar of our common Father and Creator.{336}\n\nThe responsibility which you have assumed in this regard is truly awful,\nand how you could stagger under it these many years is marvelous. Your\nmind must have become darkened, your heart hardened, your conscience\nseared and petrified, or you would have long since thrown off the\naccursed load, and sought relief at the hands of a sin-forgiving God.\nHow, let me ask, would you look upon me, were I, some dark night, in\ncompany with a band of hardened villains, to enter the precincts of\nyour elegant dwelling, and seize the person of your own lovely daughter,\nAmanda, and carry her off from your family, friends, and all the loved\nones of her youth--make her my slave--compel her to work, and I take her\nwages--place her name on my ledger as property--disregard her personal\nrights--fetter the powers of her immortal soul by denying her the right\nand privilege of learning to read and write--feed her coarsely--clothe\nher scantily, and whip her on the naked back occasionally; more, and\nstill more horrible, leave her unprotected--a degraded victim to the\nbrutal lust of fiendish overseers, who would pollute, blight, and\nblast her fair soul--rob her of all dignity--destroy her virtue, and\nannihilate in her person all the graces that adorn the character of\nvirtuous womanhood? I ask, how would you regard me, if such were my\nconduct? Oh! the vocabulary of the damned would not afford a word\nsufficiently infernal to express your idea of my God-provoking\nwickedness. Yet, sir, your treatment of my beloved sisters is in all\nessential points precisely like the case I have now supposed. Damning as\nwould be such a deed on my part, it would be no more so than that which\nyou have committed against me and my sisters.\n\nI will now bring this letter to a close; you shall hear from me again\nunless you let me hear from you. I intend to make use of you as a weapon\nwith which to assail the system of slavery--as a means of concentrating\npublic attention on the system, and deepening the horror of trafficking\nin the souls and bodies of men. I shall make use of you as a means of\nexposing the character of the American church and clergy--and as a means\nof bringing this guilty nation, with yourself, to repentance. In doing\nthis, I entertain no malice toward you personally. There is no roof\nunder which you would be more safe than mine, and there is nothing in my\nhouse which you might need for your comfort, which I would not readily\ngrant. Indeed, I should esteem it a privilege to set you an example as\nto how mankind ought to treat each other.\n\n        _I am your fellow-man, but not your slave_.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE NATURE OF SLAVERY. Extract from a Lecture on Slavery, at Rochester,\nDecember 1, 1850\n\n\nMore than twenty years of my life were consumed in a state of slavery.\nMy childhood was environed by the baneful peculiarities of the slave\nsystem. I grew up to manhood in the presence of this hydra headed\nmonster--not as a master--not as an idle spectator--not as the guest of\nthe slaveholder--but as A SLAVE, eating the bread and drinking the cup\nof slavery with the most degraded of my brother-bondmen, and sharing\nwith them all the painful conditions of their wretched lot. In\nconsideration of these facts, I feel that I have a right to speak, and\nto speak _strongly_. Yet, my friends, I feel bound to speak truly.\n\nGoading as have been the cruelties to which I have been\nsubjected--bitter as have been the trials through which I have\npassed--exasperating as have been, and still are, the indignities\noffered to my manhood--I find in them no excuse for the slightest\ndeparture from truth in dealing with any branch of this subject.\n\nFirst of all, I will state, as well as I can, the legal and social\nrelation of master and slave. A master is one--to speak in the\nvocabulary of the southern states--who claims and exercises a right of\nproperty in the person of a fellow-man. This he does with the force of\nthe law and the sanction of southern religion. The law gives the master\nabsolute power over the slave. He may work him, flog him, hire him\nout, sell him, and, in certain contingencies, _kill_ him, with perfect\nimpunity. The slave is a human being, divested of all rights--reduced\nto the level of a brute--a mere “chattel” in the eye of the law--placed\nbeyond the circle of human brotherhood--cut off from his kind--his\nname, which the “recording angel” may have enrolled in heaven, among the\nblest, is impiously inserted in a _master’s ledger_, with horses, sheep,\nand swine. In law, the slave has no wife, no children, no country, and\nno home. He can own nothing, possess nothing, acquire nothing, but what\nmust belong to another. To{338} eat the fruit of his own toil, to clothe\nhis person with the work of his own hands, is considered stealing. He\ntoils that another may reap the fruit; he is industrious that another\nmay live in idleness; he eats unbolted meal that another may eat the\nbread of fine flour; he labors in chains at home, under a burning sun\nand biting lash, that another may ride in ease and splendor abroad;\nhe lives in ignorance that another may be educated; he is abused that\nanother may be exalted; he rests his toil-worn limbs on the cold, damp\nground that another may repose on the softest pillow; he is clad in\ncoarse and tattered raiment that another may be arrayed in purple and\nfine linen; he is sheltered only by the wretched hovel that a master may\ndwell in a magnificent mansion; and to this condition he is bound down\nas by an arm of iron.\n\nFrom this monstrous relation there springs an unceasing stream of most\nrevolting cruelties. The very accompaniments of the slave system\nstamp it as the offspring of hell itself. To ensure good behavior, the\nslaveholder relies on the whip; to induce proper humility, he relies on\nthe whip; to rebuke what he is pleased to term insolence, he relies\non the whip; to supply the place of wages as an incentive to toil, he\nrelies on the whip; to bind down the spirit of the slave, to imbrute\nand destroy his manhood, he relies on the whip, the chain, the gag,\nthe thumb-screw, the pillory, the bowie knife the pistol, and the\nblood-hound. These are the necessary and unvarying accompaniments of\nthe system. Wherever slavery is found, these horrid instruments are also\nfound. Whether on the coast of Africa, among the savage tribes, or in\nSouth Carolina, among the refined and civilized, slavery is the same,\nand its accompaniments one and the same. It makes no difference whether\nthe slaveholder worships the God of the Christians, or is a follower of\nMahomet, he is the minister of the same cruelty, and the author of\nthe same misery. _Slavery_ is always _slavery;_ always the same foul,\nhaggard, and damning scourge, whether found in the eastern or in the\nwestern hemisphere.\n\nThere is a still deeper shade to be given to this picture. The physical\ncruelties are indeed sufficiently harassing and revolting; but they are\nas a few grains of sand on the sea shore, or a few drops of water in the\ngreat ocean, compared with the stupendous wrongs which it inflicts upon\nthe mental, moral, and religious nature of its hapless victims. It is\nonly when we contemplate the slave as a moral and intellectual being,\nthat we can adequately comprehend the unparalleled enormity of slavery,\nand the intense criminality of the slaveholder. I have said that the\nslave was a man. “What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! How\ninfinite in faculties! In form and moving how express and admirable!\nIn action{339} how like an angel! In apprehension how like a God! The\nbeauty of the world! The paragon of animals!”\n\nThe slave is a man, “the image of God,” but “a little lower than the\nangels;” possessing a soul, eternal and indestructible; capable of\nendless happiness, or immeasurable woe; a creature of hopes and fears,\nof affections and passions, of joys and sorrows, and he is endowed with\nthose mysterious powers by which man soars above the things of time and\nsense, and grasps, with undying tenacity, the elevating and sublimely\nglorious idea of a God. It is _such_ a being that is smitten and\nblasted. The first work of slavery is to mar and deface those\ncharacteristics of its victims which distinguish _men_ from _things_,\nand _persons_ from _property_. Its first aim is to destroy all sense\nof high moral and religious responsibility. It reduces man to a mere\nmachine. It cuts him off from his Maker, it hides from him the laws of\nGod, and leaves him to grope his way from time to eternity in the dark,\nunder the arbitrary and despotic control of a frail, depraved, and\nsinful fellow-man. As the serpent-charmer of India is compelled to\nextract the deadly teeth of his venomous prey before he is able to\nhandle him with impunity, so the slaveholder must strike down the\nconscience of the slave before he can obtain the entire mastery over his\nvictim.\n\nIt is, then, the first business of the enslaver of men to blunt, deaden,\nand destroy the central principle of human responsibility. Conscience\nis, to the individual soul, and to society, what the law of gravitation\nis to the universe. It holds society together; it is the basis of all\ntrust and confidence; it is the pillar of all moral rectitude. Without\nit, suspicion would take the place of trust; vice would be more than a\nmatch for virtue; men would prey upon each other, like the wild beasts\nof the desert; and earth would become a _hell_.\n\nNor is slavery more adverse to the conscience than it is to the mind.\nThis is shown by the fact, that in every state of the American Union,\nwhere slavery exists, except the state of Kentucky, there are laws\nabsolutely prohibitory of education among the slaves. The crime\nof teaching a slave to read is punishable with severe fines and\nimprisonment, and, in some instances, with _death itself_.\n\nNor are the laws respecting this matter a dead letter. Cases may occur\nin which they are disregarded, and a few instances may be found where\nslaves may have learned to read; but such are isolated cases, and only\nprove the rule. The great mass of slaveholders look upon education among\nthe slaves as utterly subversive of the slave system. I well remember\nwhen my mistress first announced to my master that she had dis{340}\ncovered that I could read. His face colored at once with surprise and\nchagrin. He said that “I was ruined, and my value as a slave destroyed;\nthat a slave should know nothing but to obey his master; that to give a\nnegro an inch would lead him to take an ell; that having learned how to\nread, I would soon want to know how to write; and that by-and-by I\nwould be running away.” I think my audience will bear witness to the\ncorrectness of this philosophy, and to the literal fulfillment of this\nprophecy.\n\nIt is perfectly well understood at the south, that to educate a slave\nis to make him discontened(sic) with slavery, and to invest him with a\npower which shall open to him the treasures of freedom; and since the\nobject of the slaveholder is to maintain complete authority over his\nslave, his constant vigilance is exercised to prevent everything\nwhich militates against, or endangers, the stability of his authority.\nEducation being among the menacing influences, and, perhaps, the most\ndangerous, is, therefore, the most cautiously guarded against.\n\nIt is true that we do not often hear of the enforcement of the law,\npunishing as a crime the teaching of slaves to read, but this is not\nbecause of a want of disposition to enforce it. The true reason or\nexplanation of the matter is this: there is the greatest unanimity of\nopinion among the white population in the south in favor of the policy\nof keeping the slave in ignorance. There is, perhaps, another reason why\nthe law against education is so seldom violated. The slave is too poor\nto be able to offer a temptation sufficiently strong to induce a white\nman to violate it; and it is not to be supposed that in a community\nwhere the moral and religious sentiment is in favor of slavery, many\nmartyrs will be found sacrificing their liberty and lives by violating\nthose prohibitory enactments.\n\nAs a general rule, then, darkness reigns over the abodes of the\nenslaved, and “how great is that darkness!”\n\nWe are sometimes told of the contentment of the slaves, and are\nentertained with vivid pictures of their happiness. We are told that\nthey often dance and sing; that their masters frequently give them\nwherewith to make merry; in fine, that they have little of which to\ncomplain. I admit that the slave does sometimes sing, dance, and appear\nto be merry. But what does this prove? It only proves to my mind, that\nthough slavery is armed with a thousand stings, it is not able entirely\nto kill the elastic spirit of the bondman. That spirit will rise and\nwalk abroad, despite of whips and chains, and extract from the cup\nof nature occasional drops of joy and gladness. No thanks to the\nslaveholder, nor to slavery, that the{341} vivacious captive may\nsometimes dance in his chains; his very mirth in such circumstances\nstands before God as an accusing angel against his enslaver.\n\nIt is often said, by the opponents of the anti-slavery cause, that the\ncondition of the people of Ireland is more deplorable than that of the\nAmerican slaves. Far be it from me to underrate the sufferings of the\nIrish people. They have been long oppressed; and the same heart\nthat prompts me to plead the cause of the American bondman, makes it\nimpossible for me not to sympathize with the oppressed of all lands. Yet\nI must say that there is no analogy between the two cases. The Irishman\nis poor, but he is not a slave. He may be in rags, but he is not a\nslave. He is still the master of his own body, and can say with the\npoet, “The hand of Douglass is his own.” “The world is all before\nhim, where to choose;” and poor as may be my opinion of the British\nparliament, I cannot believe that it will ever sink to such a depth\nof infamy as to pass a law for the recapture of fugitive Irishmen! The\nshame and scandal of kidnapping will long remain wholly monopolized by\nthe American congress. The Irishman has not only the liberty to emigrate\nfrom his country, but he has liberty at home. He can write, and speak,\nand cooperate for the attainment of his rights and the redress of his\nwrongs.\n\nThe multitude can assemble upon all the green hills and fertile plains\nof the Emerald Isle; they can pour out their grievances, and proclaim\ntheir wants without molestation; and the press, that “swift-winged\nmessenger,” can bear the tidings of their doings to the extreme bounds\nof the civilized world. They have their “Conciliation Hall,” on the\nbanks of the Liffey, their reform clubs, and their newspapers; they pass\nresolutions, send forth addresses, and enjoy the right of petition. But\nhow is it with the American slave? Where may he assemble? Where is\nhis Conciliation Hall? Where are his newspapers? Where is his right of\npetition? Where is his freedom of speech? his liberty of the press? and\nhis right of locomotion? He is said to be happy; happy men can speak.\nBut ask the slave what is his condition--what his state of mind--what he\nthinks of enslavement? and you had as well address your inquiries to the\n_silent dead_. There comes no _voice_ from the enslaved. We are left to\ngather his feelings by imagining what ours would be, were our souls in\nhis soul’s stead.\n\nIf there were no other fact descriptive of slavery, than that the slave\nis dumb, this alone would be sufficient to mark the slave system as a\ngrand aggregation of human horrors.\n\nMost who are present, will have observed that leading men in this{342}\ncountry have been putting forth their skill to secure quiet to the\nnation. A system of measures to promote this object was adopted a few\nmonths ago in congress. The result of those measures is known. Instead\nof quiet, they have produced alarm; instead of peace, they have brought\nus war; and so it must ever be.\n\nWhile this nation is guilty of the enslavement of three millions of\ninnocent men and women, it is as idle to think of having a sound and\nlasting peace, as it is to think there is no God to take cognizance of\nthe affairs of men. There can be no peace to the wicked while slavery\ncontinues in the land. It will be condemned; and while it is condemned\nthere will be agitation. Nature must cease to be nature; men must\nbecome monsters; humanity must be transformed; Christianity must be\nexterminated; all ideas of justice and the laws of eternal goodness must\nbe utterly blotted out from the human soul--ere a system so foul and\ninfernal can escape condemnation, or this guilty republic can have a\nsound, enduring peace.\n\n\n\n\nINHUMANITY OF SLAVERY. Extract from A Lecture on Slavery, at Rochester,\nDecember 8, 1850\n\n\nThe relation of master and slave has been called patriarchal, and only\nsecond in benignity and tenderness to that of the parent and child. This\nrepresentation is doubtless believed by many northern people; and this\nmay account, in part, for the lack of interest which we find among\npersons whom we are bound to believe to be honest and humane. What,\nthen, are the facts? Here I will not quote my own experience in slavery;\nfor this you might call one-sided testimony. I will not cite\nthe declarations of abolitionists; for these you might pronounce\nexaggerations. I will not rely upon advertisements cut from newspapers;\nfor these you might call isolated cases. But I will refer you to the\nlaws adopted by the legislatures of the slave states. I give you such\nevidence, because it cannot be invalidated nor denied. I hold in my hand\nsundry extracts from the slave codes of our country, from which I will\nquote. * * *\n\nNow, if the foregoing be an indication of kindness, _what is cruelty_?\nIf this be parental affection, _what is bitter malignity_? A more\natrocious and blood-thirsty string of laws could not well be conceived\nof. And yet I am bound to say that they fall short of indicating the\nhorrible cruelties constantly practiced in the slave states.\n\nI admit that there are individual slaveholders less cruel and barbarous\nthan is allowed by law; but these form the exception. The majority of\nslaveholders find it necessary, to insure obedience, at times, to avail\nthemselves of the utmost extent of the law, and many go beyond it. If\nkindness were the rule, we should not see advertisements filling the\ncolumns of almost every southern newspaper, offering large rewards for\nfugitive slaves, and describing them as being branded with irons,\nloaded with chains, and scarred by the whip. One of the most telling\ntestimonies against the pretended kindness of slaveholders, is the fact\nthat uncounted numbers of fugitives are now inhabiting the Dismal\nSwamp, preferring{344} the untamed wilderness to their cultivated\nhomes--choosing rather to encounter hunger and thirst, and to roam with\nthe wild beasts of the forest, running the hazard of being hunted and\nshot down, than to submit to the authority of _kind_ masters.\n\nI tell you, my friends, humanity is never driven to such an unnatural\ncourse of life, without great wrong. The slave finds more of the milk of\nhuman kindness in the bosom of the savage Indian, than in the heart\nof his _Christian_ master. He leaves the man of the _bible_, and takes\nrefuge with the man of the _tomahawk_. He rushes from the praying\nslaveholder into the paws of the bear. He quits the homes of men for\nthe haunts of wolves. He prefers to encounter a life of trial, however\nbitter, or death, however terrible, to dragging out his existence under\nthe dominion of these _kind_ masters.\n\nThe apologists for slavery often speak of the abuses of slavery; and\nthey tell us that they are as much opposed to those abuses as we are;\nand that they would go as far to correct those abuses and to ameliorate\nthe condition of the slave as anybody. The answer to that view is, that\nslavery is itself an abuse; that it lives by abuse; and dies by the\nabsence of abuse. Grant that slavery is right; grant that the relations\nof master and slave may innocently exist; and there is not a single\noutrage which was ever committed against the slave but what finds an\napology in the very necessity of the case. As we said by a slaveholder\n(the Rev. A. G. Few) to the Methodist conference, “If the relation be\nright, the means to maintain it are also right;” for without those\nmeans slavery could not exist. Remove the dreadful scourge--the plaited\nthong--the galling fetter--the accursed chain--and let the slaveholder\nrely solely upon moral and religious power, by which to secure obedience\nto his orders, and how long do you suppose a slave would remain on\nhis plantation? The case only needs to be stated; it carries its own\nrefutation with it.\n\nAbsolute and arbitrary power can never be maintained by one man over the\nbody and soul of another man, without brutal chastisement and enormous\ncruelty.\n\nTo talk of _kindness_ entering into a relation in which one party is\nrobbed of wife, of children, of his hard earnings, of home, of friends,\nof society, of knowledge, and of all that makes this life desirable, is\nmost absurd, wicked, and preposterous.\n\nI have shown that slavery is wicked--wicked, in that it violates the\ngreat law of liberty, written on every human heart--wicked, in that it\nviolates the first command of the decalogue--wicked, in that it\nfosters the most disgusting licentiousness--wicked, in that it mars\nand defaces{345} the image of God by cruel and barbarous\ninflictions--wicked, in that it contravenes the laws of eternal justice,\nand tramples in the dust all the humane and heavenly precepts of the New\nTestament.\n\nThe evils resulting from this huge system of iniquity are not confined\nto the states south of Mason and Dixon’s line. Its noxious influence can\neasily be traced throughout our northern borders. It comes even as\nfar north as the state of New York. Traces of it may be seen even in\nRochester; and travelers have told me it casts its gloomy shadows across\nthe lake, approaching the very shores of Queen Victoria’s dominions.\n\nThe presence of slavery may be explained by--as it is the explanation\nof--the mobocratic violence which lately disgraced New York, and\nwhich still more recently disgraced the city of Boston. These violent\ndemonstrations, these outrageous invasions of human rights, faintly\nindicate the presence and power of slavery here. It is a significant\nfact, that while meetings for almost any purpose under heaven may be\nheld unmolested in the city of Boston, that in the same city, a meeting\ncannot be peaceably held for the purpose of preaching the doctrine of\nthe American Declaration of Independence, “that all men are created\nequal.” The pestiferous breath of slavery taints the whole moral\natmosphere of the north, and enervates the moral energies of the whole\npeople.\n\nThe moment a foreigner ventures upon our soil, and utters a natural\nrepugnance to oppression, that moment he is made to feel that there is\nlittle sympathy in this land for him. If he were greeted with smiles\nbefore, he meets with frowns now; and it shall go well with him if he\nbe not subjected to that peculiarly fining method of showing fealty to\nslavery, the assaults of a mob.\n\nNow, will any man tell me that such a state of things is natural, and\nthat such conduct on the part of the people of the north, springs from a\nconsciousness of rectitude? No! every fibre of the human heart unites\nin detestation of tyranny, and it is only when the human mind has become\nfamiliarized with slavery, is accustomed to its injustice, and corrupted\nby its selfishness, that it fails to record its abhorrence of slavery,\nand does not exult in the triumphs of liberty.\n\nThe northern people have been long connected with slavery; they have\nbeen linked to a decaying corpse, which has destroyed the moral health.\nThe union of the government; the union of the north and south, in the\npolitical parties; the union in the religious organizations of the land,\nhave all served to deaden the moral sense of the northern people, and to\nimpregnate them with sentiments and ideas forever in conflict with\nwhat as a nation we call _genius of American institutions_. Rightly\nviewed,{346} this is an alarming fact, and ought to rally all that is\npure, just, and holy in one determined effort to crush the monster of\ncorruption, and to scatter “its guilty profits” to the winds. In a high\nmoral sense, as well as in a national sense, the whole American people\nare responsible for slavery, and must share, in its guilt and shame,\nwith the most obdurate men-stealers of the south.\n\nWhile slavery exists, and the union of these states endures, every\nAmerican citizen must bear the chagrin of hearing his country branded\nbefore the world as a nation of liars and hypocrites; and behold his\ncherished flag pointed at with the utmost scorn and derision. Even now\nan American _abroad_ is pointed out in the crowd, as coming from a land\nwhere men gain their fortunes by “the blood of souls,” from a land of\nslave markets, of blood-hounds, and slave-hunters; and, in some circles,\nsuch a man is shunned altogether, as a moral pest. Is it not time, then,\nfor every American to awake, and inquire into his duty with respect to\nthis subject?\n\nWendell Phillips--the eloquent New England orator--on his return from\nEurope, in 1842, said, “As I stood upon the shores of Genoa, and saw\nfloating on the placid waters of the Mediterranean, the beautiful\nAmerican war ship Ohio, with her masts tapering proportionately aloft,\nand an eastern sun reflecting her noble form upon the sparkling waters,\nattracting the gaze of the multitude, my first impulse was of pride, to\nthink myself an American; but when I thought that the first time that\ngallant ship would gird on her gorgeous apparel, and wake from beneath\nher sides her dormant thunders, it would be in defense of the African\nslave trade, I blushed in utter _shame_ for my country.”\n\nLet me say again, _slavery is alike the sin and the shame of the\nAmerican people;_ it is a blot upon the American name, and the only\nnational reproach which need make an American hang his head in shame, in\nthe presence of monarchical governments.\n\nWith this gigantic evil in the land, we are constantly told to look\n_at home;_ if we say ought against crowned heads, we are pointed to our\nenslaved millions; if we talk of sending missionaries and bibles\nabroad, we are pointed to three millions now lying in worse than heathen\ndarkness; if we express a word of sympathy for Kossuth and his Hungarian\nfugitive brethren, we are pointed to that horrible and hell-black\nenactment, “the fugitive slave bill.”\n\nSlavery blunts the edge of all our rebukes of tyranny abroad--the\ncriticisms that we make upon other nations, only call forth ridicule,\ncontempt, and scorn. In a word, we are made a reproach and a by-word\nto a{347} mocking earth, and we must continue to be so made, so long as\nslavery continues to pollute our soil.\n\nWe have heard much of late of the virtue of patriotism, the love of\ncountry, &c., and this sentiment, so natural and so strong, has been\nimpiously appealed to, by all the powers of human selfishness, to\ncherish the viper which is stinging our national life away. In its name,\nwe have been called upon to deepen our infamy before the world, to\nrivet the fetter more firmly on the limbs of the enslaved, and to become\nutterly insensible to the voice of human woe that is wafted to us on\nevery southern gale. We have been called upon, in its name, to desecrate\nour whole land by the footprints of slave-hunters, and even to engage\nourselves in the horrible business of kidnapping.\n\nI, too, would invoke the spirit of patriotism; not in a narrow and\nrestricted sense, but, I trust, with a broad and manly signification;\nnot to cover up our national sins, but to inspire us with sincere\nrepentance; not to hide our shame from the the(sic) world’s gaze, but\nutterly to abolish the cause of that shame; not to explain away our\ngross inconsistencies as a nation, but to remove the hateful, jarring,\nand incongruous elements from the land; not to sustain an egregious\nwrong, but to unite all our energies in the grand effort to remedy that\nwrong.\n\nI would invoke the spirit of patriotism, in the name of the law of\nthe living God, natural and revealed, and in the full belief that\n“righteousness exalteth a nation, while sin is a reproach to any\npeople.” “He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that\ndespiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from the\nholding of bribes, he shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall\nbe the munitions of rocks, bread shall be given him, his water shall be\nsure.”\n\nWe have not only heard much lately of patriotism, and of its aid being\ninvoked on the side of slavery and injustice, but the very prosperity of\nthis people has been called in to deafen them to the voice of duty, and\nto lead them onward in the pathway of sin. Thus has the blessing of God\nbeen converted into a curse. In the spirit of genuine patriotism, I warn\nthe American people, by all that is just and honorable, to BEWARE!\n\nI warn them that, strong, proud, and prosperous though we be, there is\na power above us that can “bring down high looks; at the breath of whose\nmouth our wealth may take wings; and before whom every knee shall bow;”\n and who can tell how soon the avenging angel may pass over our land,\nand the sable bondmen now in chains, may become the instruments of our\nnation’s chastisement! Without appealing to any higher feeling, I would\nwarn the American people, and the American government,{348}  to be wise\nin their day and generation. I exhort them to remember the history of\nother nations; and I remind them that America cannot always sit “as a\nqueen,” in peace and repose; that prouder and stronger governments than\nthis have been shattered by the bolts of a just God; that the time may\ncome when those they now despise and hate, may be needed; when those\nwhom they now compel by oppression to be enemies, may be wanted as\nfriends. What has been, may be again. There is a point beyond which\nhuman endurance cannot go. The crushed worm may yet turn under the heel\nof the oppressor. I warn them, then, with all solemnity, and in the name\nof retributive justice, _to look to their ways;_ for in an evil hour,\nthose sable arms that have, for the last two centuries, been engaged in\ncultivating and adorning the fair fields of our country, may yet\nbecome the instruments of terror, desolation, and death, throughout our\nborders.\n\nIt was the sage of the Old Dominion that said--while speaking of the\npossibility of a conflict between the slaves and the slaveholders--“God\nhas no attribute that could take sides with the oppressor in such a\ncontest. I tremble for my country when I reflect that God _is just_,\nand that his justice cannot sleep forever.” Such is the warning voice of\nThomas Jefferson; and every day’s experience since its utterance until\nnow, confirms its wisdom, and commends its truth.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT TO THE SLAVE IS THE FOURTH OF JULY?. Extract from an Oration, at\nRochester, July 5, 1852\n\n\nFellow-Citizens--Pardon me, and allow me to ask, why am I called upon\nto speak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your\nnational independence? Are the great principles of political freedom\nand of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence,\nextended to us? and am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble\noffering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits, and express\ndevout gratitude for the blessings, resulting from your independence to\nus?\n\nWould to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer\ncould be truthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be\nlight, and my burden easy and delightful. For who is there so cold that\na nation’s sympathy could not warm him? Who so obdurate and dead to\nthe claims of gratitude, that would not thankfully acknowledge such\npriceless benefits? Who so stolid and selfish, that would not give his\nvoice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation’s jubilee, when the chains\nof servitude had been torn from his limbs? I am not that man. In a case\nlike that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the “lame man leap as an\nhart.”\n\nBut, such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the\ndisparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious\nanniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable\ndistance between us. The blessings in which you this day rejoice,\nare not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty,\nprosperity, and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by\nyou, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has\nbrought stripes and death to me. This Fourth of July is _yours_, not\nmine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the\ngrand illuminated{350} temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you\nin joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you\nmean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak to-day? If so, there\nis a parallel to your conduct. And let me warn you that it is dangerous\nto copy the example of a nation whose crimes, towering up to heaven,\nwere thrown down by the breath of the Almighty, burying that nation\nin irrecoverable ruin! I can to-day take up the plaintive lament of a\npeeled and woe-smitten people.\n\n“By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yea! we wept when we\nremembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst\nthereof. For there, they that carried us away captive, required of us a\nsong; and they who wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one\nof the songs of Zion. How can we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land?\nIf I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If\nI do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.”\n\nFellow-citizens, above your national, tumultous joy, I hear the mournful\nwail of millions, whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are to-day\nrendered more intolerable by the jubilant shouts that reach them. If I\ndo forget, if I do not faithfully remember those bleeding children\nof sorrow this day, “may my right hand forget her cunning, and may my\ntongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!” To forget them, to pass lightly\nover their wrongs, and to chime in with the popular theme, would be\ntreason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach\nbefore God and the world. My subject, then, fellow-citizens, is AMERICAN\nSLAVERY. I shall see this day and its popular characteristics from the\nslave’s point of view. Standing there, identified with the American\nbondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate to declare, with\nall my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked\nblacker to me than on this Fourth of July. Whether we turn to the\ndeclarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the\nconduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. America is\nfalse to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to\nbe false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding\nslave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which is\noutraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the\nconstitution and the bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon,\ndare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can\ncommand, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery--the great sin and\nshame of America! “I will not equivocate; I will not excuse;” I will use\nthe severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape\nme that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who\nis not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.\n{351}\n\nBut I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this\ncircumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a\nfavorable impression on the public mind. Would you argue more, and\ndenounce less, would you persuade more and rebuke less, your cause would\nbe much more likely to succeed. But, I submit, where all is plain there\nis nothing to be argued. What point in the anti-slavery creed would\nyou have me argue? On what branch of the subject do the people of this\ncountry need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is a man?\nThat point is conceded already. Nobody doubts it. The slaveholders\nthemselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government.\nThey acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the\nslave. There are seventy-two crimes in the state of Virginia, which, if\ncommitted by a black man (no matter how ignorant he be), subject him\nto the punishment of death; while only two of these same crimes will\nsubject a white man to the like punishment. What is this but the\nacknowledgement that the slave is a moral, intellectual, and responsible\nbeing. The manhood of the slave is conceded. It is admitted in the fact\nthat southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding,\nunder severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or\nwrite. When you can point to any such laws, in reference to the beasts\nof the field, then I may consent to argue the manhood of the slave. When\nthe dogs in your streets, when the fowls of the air, when the cattle on\nyour hills, when the fish of the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall\nbe unable to distinguish the slave from a brute, then will I argue with\nyou that the slave is a man!\n\nFor the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the Negro\nrace. Is it not astonishing that, while we are plowing, planting,\nand reaping, using all kinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses,\nconstructing bridges, building ships, working in metals of brass, iron,\ncopper, silver, and gold; that, while we are reading, writing, and\ncyphering, acting as clerks, merchants, and secretaries, having among\nus lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators, and\nteachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common\nto other men--digging gold in California, capturing the whale in the\nPacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hillside, living, moving,\nacting, thinking, planning, living in families as husbands, wives, and\nchildren, and, above all, confessing and worshiping the Christian’s God,\nand looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave--we are\ncalled upon to prove that we are men!\n\nWould you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? that he is the\nrightful owner of his own body? You have already declared it. Must\nI argue the wrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for\nrepublicans?{352} Is it to be settled by the rules of logic and\nargumentation, as a matter beset with great difficulty, involving a\ndoubtful application of the principle of justice, hard to be understood?\nHow should I look to-day in the presence of Americans, dividing and\nsubdividing a discourse, to show that men have a natural right to\nfreedom, speaking of it relatively and positively, negatively and\naffirmatively? To do so, would be to make myself ridiculous, and to\noffer an insult to your understanding. There is not a man beneath the\ncanopy of heaven that does not know that slavery is wrong for _him_.\n\nWhat! am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them\nof their liberty, to work them without wages, to keep them ignorant of\ntheir relations to their fellow-men, to beat them with sticks, to flay\ntheir flesh with the lash, to load their limbs with irons, to hunt them\nwith dogs, to sell them at auction, to sunder their families, to knock\nout their teeth, to burn their flesh, to starve them into obedience and\nsubmission to their masters? Must I argue that a system, thus marked\nwith blood and stained with pollution, is wrong? No; I will not. I have\nbetter employment for my time and strength than such arguments would\nimply.\n\nWhat, then, remains to be argued? Is it that slavery is not divine; that\nGod did not establish it; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken?\nThere is blasphemy in the thought. That which is inhuman cannot be\ndivine. Who can reason on such a proposition! They that can, may! I\ncannot. The time for such argument is past.\n\nAt a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is\nneeded. Oh! had I the ability, and could I reach the nation’s ear,\nI would to-day pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting\nreproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. For it is not light that\nis needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need\nthe storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation\nmust be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the\npropriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation\nmust be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed\nand denounced.\n\nWhat to the American slave is your Fourth of July? I answer, a day\nthat reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross\ninjustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your\ncelebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your\nnational greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty\nand heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass-fronted impudence;\nyour shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and\nhymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade\nand solemnity,{353} are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety,\nand hypocrisy--a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace\na nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of\npractices more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United\nStates, at this very hour.\n\nGo where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies\nand despotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search\nout every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the\nside of the every-day practices of this nation, and you will say with\nme, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America\nreigns without a rival.\n\n\n\n\nTHE INTERNAL SLAVE TRADE. Extract from an Oration, at Rochester, July\n5, 1852\n\n\nTake the American slave trade, which, we are told by the papers, is\nespecially prosperous just now. Ex-senator Benton tells us that the\nprice of men was never higher than now. He mentions the fact to show\nthat slavery is in no danger. This trade is one of the peculiarities\nof American institutions. It is carried on in all the large towns and\ncities in one-half of this confederacy; and millions are pocketed every\nyear by dealers in this horrid traffic. In several states this trade\nis a chief source of wealth. It is called (in contradistinction to the\nforeign slave trade) _“the internal slave trade_.” It is, probably,\ncalled so, too, in order to divert from it the horror with which the\nforeign slave trade is contemplated. That trade has long since been\ndenounced by this government as piracy. It has been denounced with\nburning words, from the high places of the nation, as an execrable\ntraffic. To arrest it, to put an end to it, this nation keeps a\nsquadron, at immense cost, on the coast of Africa. Everywhere in this\ncountry, it is safe to speak of this foreign slave trade as a most\ninhuman traffic, opposed alike to the laws of God and of man. The\nduty to extirpate and destroy it is admitted even by our _doctors\nof divinity_. In order to put an end to it, some of these last have\nconsented that their colored brethren (nominally free) should leave this\ncountry, and establish themselves on the western coast of Africa. It is,\nhowever, a notable fact, that, while so much execration is poured out\nby Americans, upon those engaged in the foreign slave trade, the men\nengaged in the slave trade between the states pass without condemnation,\nand their business is deemed honorable.\n\nBehold the practical operation of this internal slave trade--the\nAmerican slave trade sustained by American politics and American\nreligion! Here you will see men and women reared like swine for the\nmarket. You know what is a swine-drover? I will show you a man-drover.\nThey inhabit all our southern states. They perambulate the country, and\ncrowd the{355} highways of the nation with droves of human stock. You\nwill see one of these human-flesh-jobbers, armed with pistol, whip, and\nbowie-knife, driving a company of a hundred men, women, and children,\nfrom the Potomac to the slave market at New Orleans. These wretched\npeople are to be sold singly, or in lots, to suit purchasers. They\nare food for the cotton-field and the deadly sugar-mill. Mark the sad\nprocession as it moves wearily along, and the inhuman wretch who drives\nthem. Hear his savage yells and his blood-chilling oaths, as he hurries\non his affrighted captives. There, see the old man, with locks thinned\nand gray. Cast one glance, if you please, upon that young mother, whose\nshoulders are bare to the scorching sun, her briny tears falling on the\nbrow of the babe in her arms. See, too, that girl of thirteen, weeping,\nyes, weeping, as she thinks of the mother from whom she has been torn.\nThe drove moves tardily. Heat and sorrow have nearly consumed their\nstrength. Suddenly you hear a quick snap, like the discharge of a rifle;\nthe fetters clank, and the chain rattles simultaneously; your ears are\nsaluted with a scream that seems to have torn its way to the center\nof your soul. The crack you heard was the sound of the slave whip; the\nscream you heard was from the woman you saw with the babe. Her speed had\nfaltered under the weight of her child and her chains; that gash on her\nshoulder tells her to move on. Follow this drove to New Orleans. Attend\nthe auction; see men examined like horses; see the forms of women rudely\nand brutally exposed to the shocking gaze of American slave-buyers. See\nthis drove sold and separated forever; and never forget the deep, sad\nsobs that arose from that scattered multitude. Tell me, citizens, where,\nunder the sun, can you witness a spectacle more fiendish and shocking.\nYet this is but a glance at the American slave trade, as it exists at\nthis moment, in the ruling part of the United States.\n\nI was born amid such sights and scenes. To me the American slave trade\nis a terrible reality. When a child, my soul was often pierced with\na sense of its horrors. I lived on Philpot street, Fell’s Point,\nBaltimore, and have watched from the wharves the slave ships in the\nbasin, anchored from the shore, with their cargoes of human flesh,\nwaiting for favorable winds to waft them down the Chesapeake. There was,\nat that time, a grand slave mart kept at the head of Pratt street, by\nAustin Woldfolk. His agents were sent into every town and county in\nMaryland, announcing their arrival through the papers, and on flaming\nhand-bills, headed, “cash for negroes.” These men were generally well\ndressed, and very captivating in their manners; ever ready to drink, to\ntreat, and to gamble. The fate{356} of many a slave has depended upon\nthe turn of a single card; and many a child has been snatched from\nthe arms of its mothers by bargains arranged in a state of brutal\ndrunkenness.\n\nThe flesh-mongers gather up their victims by dozens, and drive them,\nchained, to the general depot at Baltimore. When a sufficient number\nhave been collected here, a ship is chartered, for the purpose of\nconveying the forlorn crew to Mobile or to New Orleans. From the\nslave-prison to the ship, they are usually driven in the darkness\nof night; for since the anti-slavery agitation a certain caution is\nobserved.\n\nIn the deep, still darkness of midnight, I have been often aroused by\nthe dead, heavy footsteps and the piteous cries of the chained gangs\nthat passed our door. The anguish of my boyish heart was intense; and I\nwas often consoled, when speaking to my mistress in the morning, to\nhear her say that the custom was very wicked; that she hated to hear the\nrattle of the chains, and the heart-rending cries. I was glad to find\none who sympathized with me in my horror.\n\nFellow citizens, this murderous traffic is to-day in active operation\nin this boasted republic. In the solitude of my spirit, I see clouds of\ndust raised on the highways of the south; I see the bleeding footsteps;\nI hear the doleful wail of fettered humanity, on the way to the slave\nmarkets, where the victims are to be sold like horses, sheep, and\nswine, knocked off to the highest bidder. There I see the tenderest ties\nruthlessly broken, to gratify the lust, caprice, and rapacity of the\nbuyers and sellers of men. My soul sickens at the sight.\n\n            _Is this the land your fathers loved?\n                The freedom which they toiled to win?\n            Is this the earth whereon they moved?\n                Are these the graves they slumber in?_\n\n\nBut a still more inhuman, disgraceful, and scandalous state of things\nremains to be presented. By an act of the American congress, not yet\ntwo years old, slavery has been nationalized in its most horrible\nand revolting form. By that act, Mason and Dixon’s line has been\nobliterated; New York has become as Virginia; and the power to hold,\nhunt, and sell men, women, and children as slaves, remains no longer a\nmere state institution, but is now an institution of the whole United\nStates. The power is coextensive with the star-spangled banner and\nAmerican christianity. Where these go, may also go the merciless\nslave-hunter. Where these are, man is not sacred. He is a bird for the\nsportsman’s gun. By that most foul and fiendish of all human decrees,\nthe liberty and person of every man are{357} put in peril. Your broad\nrepublican domain is a hunting-ground for _men_. Not for thieves and\nrobbers, enemies of society, merely, but for men guilty of no crime.\nYour law-makers have commanded all good citizens to engage in this\nhellish sport. Your president, your secretary of state, your lords,\nnobles, and ecclesiastics, enforce as a duty you owe to your free and\nglorious country and to your God, that you do this accursed thing. Not\nfewer than forty Americans have within the past two years been hunted\ndown, and without a moment’s warning, hurried away in chains, and\nconsigned to slavery and excruciating torture. Some of these have had\nwives and children dependent on them for bread; but of this no account\nwas made. The right of the hunter to his prey, stands superior to the\nright of marriage, and to _all_ rights in this republic, the rights of\nGod included! For black men there are neither law, justice, humanity,\nnor religion. The fugitive slave law makes MERCY TO THEM A CRIME; and\nbribes the judge who tries them. An American judge GETS TEN DOLLARS FOR\nEVERY VICTIM HE CONSIGNS to slavery, and five, when he fails to do so.\nThe oath of an(sic) two villains is sufficient, under this hell-black\nenactment, to send the most pious and exemplary black man into the\nremorseless jaws of slavery! His own testimony is nothing. He can bring\nno witnesses for himself. The minister of American justice is bound\nby the law to hear but _one side_, and that side is the side of\nthe oppressor. Let this damning fact be perpetually told. Let it be\nthundered around the world, that, in tyrant-killing, king hating,\npeople-loving, democratic, Christian America, the seats of justice are\nfilled with judges, who hold their office under an open and palpable\n_bribe_, and are bound, in deciding in the case of a man’s liberty, _to\nhear only his accusers!_\n\nIn glaring violation of justice, in shameless disregard of the forms of\nadministering law, in cunning arrangement to entrap the defenseless, and\nin diabolical intent, this fugitive slave law stands alone in the annals\nof tyrannical legislation. I doubt if there be another nation on\nthe globe having the brass and the baseness to put such a law on the\nstatute-book. If any man in this assembly thinks differently from me\nin this matter, and feels able to disprove my statements, I will gladly\nconfront him at any suitable time and place he may select.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SLAVERY PARTY. Extract from a Speech Delivered before the A. A. S.\nSociety, in New York, May, 1853.\n\n\nSir, it is evident that there is in this country a purely slavery\nparty--a party which exists for no other earthly purpose but to promote\nthe interests of slavery. The presence of this party is felt everywhere\nin the republic. It is known by no particular name, and has assumed no\ndefinite shape; but its branches reach far and wide in the church and in\nthe state. This shapeless and nameless party is not intangible in other\nand more important respects. That party, sir, has determined upon a\nfixed, definite, and comprehensive policy toward the whole colored\npopulation of the United States. What that policy is, it becomes us\nas abolitionists, and especially does it become the colored people\nthemselves, to consider and to understand fully. We ought to know\nwho our enemies are, where they are, and what are their objects and\nmeasures. Well, sir, here is my version of it--not original with me--but\nmine because I hold it to be true.\n\nI understand this policy to comprehend five cardinal objects. They are\nthese: 1st. The complete suppression of all anti-slavery discussion.\n2d. The expatriation of the entire free people of color from the United\nStates. 3d. The unending perpetuation of slavery in this republic. 4th.\nThe nationalization of slavery to the extent of making slavery respected\nin every state of the Union. 5th. The extension of slavery over Mexico\nand the entire South American states.\n\nSir, these objects are forcibly presented to us in the stern logic of\npassing events; in the facts which are and have been passing around us\nduring the last three years. The country has been and is now dividing\non these grand issues. In their magnitude, these issues cast all others\ninto the shade, depriving them of all life and vitality. Old party\nties are broken. Like is finding its like on either side of these great\nissues, and the great battle is at hand. For the present, the best\nrepresentative of the slavery party in politics is the democratic party.\nIts great head for the{359} present is President Pierce, whose boast it\nwas, before his election, that his whole life had been consistent with\nthe interests of slavery, that he is above reproach on that score. In\nhis inaugural address, he reassures the south on this point. Well,\nthe head of the slave power being in power, it is natural that the pro\nslavery elements should cluster around the administration, and this\nis rapidly being done. A fraternization is going on. The stringent\nprotectionists and the free-traders strike hands. The supporters of\nFillmore are becoming the supporters of Pierce. The silver-gray whig\nshakes hands with the hunker democrat; the former only differing from\nthe latter in name. They are of one heart, one mind, and the union is\nnatural and perhaps inevitable. Both hate Negroes; both hate progress;\nboth hate the “higher law;” both hate William H. Seward; both hate the\nfree democratic party; and upon this hateful basis they are forming\na union of hatred. “Pilate and Herod are thus made friends.” Even the\ncentral organ of the whig party is extending its beggar hand for a\nmorsel from the table of slavery democracy, and when spurned from the\nfeast by the more deserving, it pockets the insult; when kicked on one\nside it turns the other, and preseveres in its importunities. The fact\nis, that paper comprehends the demands of the times; it understands\nthe age and its issues; it wisely sees that slavery and freedom are the\ngreat antagonistic forces in the country, and it goes to its own side.\nSilver grays and hunkers all understand this. They are, therefore,\nrapidly sinking all other questions to nothing, compared with the\nincreasing demands of slavery. They are collecting, arranging, and\nconsolidating their forces for the accomplishment of their appointed\nwork.\n\nThe keystone to the arch of this grand union of the slavery party of the\nUnited States, is the compromise of 1850. In that compromise we have all\nthe objects of our slaveholding policy specified. It is, sir, favorable\nto this view of the designs of the slave power, that both the whig and\nthe democratic party bent lower, sunk deeper, and strained harder, in\ntheir conventions, preparatory to the late presidential election, to\nmeet the demands of the slavery party than at any previous time in\ntheir history. Never did parties come before the northern people with\npropositions of such undisguised contempt for the moral sentiment and\nthe religious ideas of that people. They virtually asked them to\nunite in a war upon free speech, and upon conscience, and to drive\nthe Almighty presence from the councils of the nation. Resting their\nplatforms upon the fugitive slave bill, they boldly asked the people\nfor political power to execute the horrible and hell-black provisions of\nthat bill. The history of that election reveals, with great clearness,\nthe extent to which{360} slavery has shot its leprous distillment\nthrough the life-blood of the nation. The party most thoroughly opposed\nto the cause of justice and humanity, triumphed; while the party\nsuspected of a leaning toward liberty, was overwhelmingly defeated, some\nsay annihilated.\n\nBut here is a still more important fact, illustrating the designs of\nthe slave power. It is a fact full of meaning, that no sooner did the\ndemocratic slavery party come into power, than a system of legislation\nwas presented to the legislatures of the northern states, designed to\nput the states in harmony with the fugitive slave law, and the malignant\nbearing of the national government toward the colored inhabitants of\nthe country. This whole movement on the part of the states, bears\nthe evidence of having one origin, emanating from one head, and urged\nforward by one power. It was simultaneous, uniform, and general, and\nlooked to one end. It was intended to put thorns under feet already\nbleeding; to crush a people already bowed down; to enslave a people\nalready but half free; in a word, it was intended to discourage,\ndishearten, and drive the free colored people out of the country. In\nlooking at the recent black law of Illinois, one is struck dumb with its\nenormity. It would seem that the men who enacted that law, had not only\nbanished from their minds all sense of justice, but all sense of\nshame. It coolly proposes to sell the bodies and souls of the blacks\nto increase the intelligence and refinement of the whites; to rob every\nblack stranger who ventures among them, to increase their literary fund.\n\nWhile this is going on in the states, a pro-slavery, political board of\nhealth is established at Washington. Senators Hale, Chase, and Sumner\nare robbed of a part of their senatorial dignity and consequence\nas representing sovereign states, because they have refused to be\ninoculated with the slavery virus. Among the services which a senator\nis expected by his state to perform, are many that can only be done\nefficiently on committees; and, in saying to these honorable senators,\nyou shall not serve on the committees of this body, the slavery party\ntook the responsibility of robbing and insulting the states that sent\nthem. It is an attempt at Washington to decide for the states who shall\nbe sent to the senate. Sir, it strikes me that this aggression on the\npart of the slave power did not meet at the hands of the proscribed\nsenators the rebuke which we had a right to expect would be\nadministered. It seems to me that an opportunity was lost, that the\ngreat principle of senatorial equality was left undefended, at a time\nwhen its vindication was sternly demanded. But it is not to the purpose\nof my present statement to criticise the conduct of our friends. I am\npersuaded that much ought to be left to the discretion of{361} anti\nslavery men in congress, and charges of recreancy should never be made\nbut on the most sufficient grounds. For, of all the places in the world\nwhere an anti-slavery man needs the confidence and encouragement of\nfriends, I take Washington to be that place.\n\nLet me now call attention to the social influences which are operating\nand cooperating with the slavery party of the country, designed to\ncontribute to one or all of the grand objects aimed at by that party.\nWe see here the black man attacked in his vital interests; prejudice and\nhate are excited against him; enmity is stirred up between him and other\nlaborers. The Irish people, warm-hearted, generous, and sympathizing\nwith the oppressed everywhere, when they stand upon their own green\nisland, are instantly taught, on arriving in this Christian country, to\nhate and despise the colored people. They are taught to believe that we\neat the bread which of right belongs to them. The cruel lie is told the\nIrish, that our adversity is essential to their prosperity. Sir, the\nIrish-American will find out his mistake one day. He will find that in\nassuming our avocation he also has assumed our degradation. But for\nthe present we are sufferers. The old employments by which we have\nheretofore gained our livelihood, are gradually, and it may be\ninevitably, passing into other hands. Every hour sees us elbowed out of\nsome employment to make room perhaps for some newly-arrived emigrants,\nwhose hunger and color are thought to give them a title to especial\nfavor. White men are becoming house-servants, cooks, and stewards,\ncommon laborers, and flunkeys to our gentry, and, for aught I see, they\nadjust themselves to their stations with all becoming obsequiousness.\nThis fact proves that if we cannot rise to the whites, the whites can\nfall to us. Now, sir, look once more. While the colored people are\nthus elbowed out of employment; while the enmity of emigrants is being\nexcited against us; while state after state enacts laws against us;\nwhile we are hunted down, like wild game, and oppressed with a general\nfeeling of insecurity--the American colonization society--that old\noffender against the best interests and slanderer of the colored\npeople--awakens to new life, and vigorously presses its scheme upon\nthe consideration of the people and the government. New papers are\nstarted--some for the north and some for the south--and each in its\ntone adapting itself to its latitude. Government, state and national, is\ncalled upon for appropriations to enable the society to send us out of\nthe country by steam! They want steamers to carry letters and Negroes\nto Africa. Evidently, this society looks upon our “extremity as its\nopportunity,” and we may expect that it will use the occasion well. They\ndo not deplore, but glory, in our misfortunes.{362}\n\nBut, sir, I must hasten. I have thus briefly given my view of one aspect\nof the present condition and future prospects of the colored people of\nthe United States. And what I have said is far from encouraging to my\nafflicted people. I have seen the cloud gather upon the sable brows of\nsome who hear me. I confess the case looks black enough. Sir, I am not a\nhopeful man. I think I am apt even to undercalculate the benefits of the\nfuture. Yet, sir, in this seemingly desperate case, I do not despair for\nmy people. There is a bright side to almost every picture of this kind;\nand ours is no exception to the general rule. If the influences against\nus are strong, those for us are also strong. To the inquiry, will our\nenemies prevail in the execution of their designs. In my God and in my\nsoul, I believe they _will not_. Let us look at the first object sought\nfor by the slavery party of the country, viz: the suppression of anti\nslavery discussion. They desire to suppress discussion on this subject,\nwith a view to the peace of the slaveholder and the security of slavery.\nNow, sir, neither the principle nor the subordinate objects here\ndeclared, can be at all gained by the slave power, and for this reason:\nIt involves the proposition to padlock the lips of the whites, in order\nto secure the fetters on the limbs of the blacks. The right of speech,\nprecious and priceless, _cannot, will not_, be surrendered to slavery.\nIts suppression is asked for, as I have said, to give peace and security\nto slaveholders. Sir, that thing cannot be done. God has interposed an\ninsuperable obstacle to any such result. “There can be _no peace_,\nsaith my God, to the wicked.” Suppose it were possible to put down this\ndiscussion, what would it avail the guilty slaveholder, pillowed as he\nis upon heaving bosoms of ruined souls? He could not have a peaceful\nspirit. If every anti-slavery tongue in the nation were silent--every\nanti-slavery organization dissolved--every anti-slavery press\ndemolished--every anti slavery periodical, paper, book, pamphlet, or\nwhat not, were searched out, gathered, deliberately burned to ashes,\nand their ashes given to the four winds of heaven, still, still the\nslaveholder could have _“no peace_.” In every pulsation of his heart, in\nevery throb of his life, in every glance of his eye, in the breeze that\nsoothes, and in the thunder that startles, would be waked up an accuser,\nwhose cause is, “Thou art, verily, guilty concerning thy brother.”\n\n\n\n\nTHE ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT. Extracts from a Lecture before Various\nAnti-Slavery Bodies, in the Winter of 1855.\n\n\nA grand movement on the part of mankind, in any direction, or for any\npurpose, moral or political, is an interesting fact, fit and proper to\nbe studied. It is such, not only for those who eagerly participate in\nit, but also for those who stand aloof from it--even for those by whom\nit is opposed. I take the anti-slavery movement to be such an one, and\na movement as sublime and glorious in its character, as it is holy and\nbeneficent in the ends it aims to accomplish. At this moment, I deem it\nsafe to say, it is properly engrossing more minds in this country than\nany other subject now before the American people. The late John C.\nCalhoun--one of the mightiest men that ever stood up in the American\nsenate--did not deem it beneath him; and he probably studied it as\ndeeply, though not as honestly, as Gerrit Smith, or William Lloyd\nGarrison. He evinced the greatest familiarity with the subject; and the\ngreatest efforts of his last years in the senate had direct reference\nto this movement. His eagle eye watched every new development connected\nwith it; and he was ever prompt to inform the south of every important\nstep in its progress. He never allowed himself to make light of it; but\nalways spoke of it and treated it as a matter of grave import; and in\nthis he showed himself a master of the mental, moral, and religious\nconstitution of human society. Daniel Webster, too, in the better days\nof his life, before he gave his assent to the fugitive slave bill, and\ntrampled upon all his earlier and better convictions--when his eye was\nyet single--he clearly comprehended the nature of the elements involved\nin this movement; and in his own majestic eloquence, warned the south,\nand the country, to have a care how they attempted to put it down. He is\nan illustration that it is easier to give, than to take, good advice.\nTo these two men--the greatest men to whom the nation has yet given\nbirth--may be traced the two great facts of the present--the south\ntriumphant, and the north humbled.{364} Their names may stand\nthus--Calhoun and domination--Webster and degradation. Yet again. If\nto the enemies of liberty this subject is one of engrossing interest,\nvastly more so should it be such to freedom’s friends. The latter, it\nleads to the gates of all valuable knowledge--philanthropic, ethical,\nand religious; for it brings them to the study of man, wonderfully and\nfearfully made--the proper study of man through all time--the open book,\nin which are the records of time and eternity.\n\nOf the existence and power of the anti-slavery movement, as a fact, you\nneed no evidence. The nation has seen its face, and felt the controlling\npressure of its hand. You have seen it moving in all directions, and in\nall weathers, and in all places, appearing most where desired least,\nand pressing hardest where most resisted. No place is exempt. The quiet\nprayer meeting, and the stormy halls of national debate, share its\npresence alike. It is a common intruder, and of course has the name\nof being ungentlemanly. Brethren who had long sung, in the most\naffectionate fervor, and with the greatest sense of security,\n\n            _Together let us sweetly live--together let us die,_\n\nhave been suddenly and violently separated by it, and ranged in hostile\nattitude toward each other. The Methodist, one of the most powerful\nreligious organizations of this country, has been rent asunder, and its\nstrongest bolts of denominational brotherhood started at a single surge.\nIt has changed the tone of the northern pulpit, and modified that of the\npress. A celebrated divine, who, four years ago, was for flinging\nhis own mother, or brother, into the remorseless jaws of the\nmonster slavery, lest he should swallow up the Union, now recognizes\nanti-slavery as a characteristic of future civilization. Signs and\nwonders follow this movement; and the fact just stated is one of them.\nParty ties are loosened by it; and men are compelled to take sides for\nor against it, whether they will or not. Come from where he may, or come\nfor what he may, he is compelled to show his hand. What is this mighty\nforce? What is its history? and what is its destiny? Is it ancient or\nmodern, transient or permanent? Has it turned aside, like a stranger\nand a sojourner, to tarry for a night? or has it come to rest with us\nforever? Excellent chances are here for speculation; and some of them\nare quite profound. We might, for instance, proceed to inquire not\nonly into the philosophy of the anti-slavery movement, but into the\nphilosophy of the law, in obedience to which that movement started into\nexistence. We might demand to know what is that law or power, which, at\ndifferent times, disposes the minds of men to this or that particular\nobject--now for peace, and now for war--now for free{365} dom, and now\nfor slavery; but this profound question I leave to the abolitionists of\nthe superior class to answer. The speculations which must precede\nsuch answer, would afford, perhaps, about the same satisfaction as the\nlearned theories which have rained down upon the world, from time to\ntime, as to the origin of evil. I shall, therefore, avoid water in which\nI cannot swim, and deal with anti-slavery as a fact, like any other fact\nin the history of mankind, capable of being described and understood,\nboth as to its internal forces, and its external phases and relations.\n\n[After an eloquent, a full, and highly interesting exposition of the\nnature, character, and history of the anti-slavery movement, from the\ninsertion of which want of space precludes us, he concluded in the\nfollowing happy manner.]\n\nPresent organizations may perish, but the cause will go on. That cause\nhas a life, distinct and independent of the organizations patched up\nfrom time to time to carry it forward. Looked at, apart from the bones\nand sinews and body, it is a thing immortal. It is the very essence of\njustice, liberty, and love. The moral life of human society, it cannot\ndie while conscience, honor, and humanity remain. If but one be filled\nwith it, the cause lives. Its incarnation in any one individual man,\nleaves the whole world a priesthood, occupying the highest moral\neminence even that of disinterested benevolence. Whoso has ascended his\nheight, and has the grace to stand there, has the world at his feet, and\nis the world’s teacher, as of divine right. He may set in judgment on\nthe age, upon the civilization of the age, and upon the religion of the\nage; for he has a test, a sure and certain test, by which to try all\ninstitutions, and to measure all men. I say, he may do this, but this\nis not the chief business for which he is qualified. The great work to\nwhich he is called is not that of judgment. Like the Prince of Peace, he\nmay say, if I judge, I judge righteous judgment; still mainly, like him,\nhe may say, this is not his work. The man who has thoroughly embraced\nthe principles of justice, love, and liberty, like the true preacher of\nChristianity, is less anxious to reproach the world of its sins, than\nto win it to repentance. His great work on earth is to exemplify, and\nto illustrate, and to ingraft those principles upon the living and\npractical understandings of all men within the reach of his influence.\nThis is his work; long or short his years, many or few his adherents,\npowerful or weak his instrumentalities, through good report, or through\nbad report, this is his work. It is to snatch from the bosom of nature\nthe latent facts of each individual man’s experience, and with steady\nhand to hold them up fresh and glowing, enforcing, with all his power,\ntheir acknowledgment and practical adoption. If there be but _one_{366}\nsuch man in the land, no matter what becomes of abolition societies\nand parties, there will be an anti-slavery cause, and an anti-slavery\nmovement. Fortunately for that cause, and fortunately for him by whom it\nis espoused, it requires no extraordinary amount of talent to preach it\nor to receive it when preached. The grand secret of its power is, that\neach of its principles is easily rendered appreciable to the faculty\nof reason in man, and that the most unenlightened conscience has no\ndifficulty in deciding on which side to register its testimony. It can\ncall its preachers from among the fishermen, and raise them to power. In\nevery human breast, it has an advocate which can be silent only when the\nheart is dead. It comes home to every man’s understanding, and appeals\ndirectly to every man’s conscience. A man that does not recognize and\napprove for himself the rights and privileges contended for, in behalf\nof the American slave, has not yet been found. In whatever else men may\ndiffer, they are alike in the apprehension of their natural and personal\nrights. The difference between abolitionists and those by whom they are\nopposed, is not as to principles. All are agreed in respect to these.\nThe manner of applying them is the point of difference.\n\nThe slaveholder himself, the daily robber of his equal brother,\ndiscourses eloquently as to the excellency of justice, and the man\nwho employs a brutal driver to flay the flesh of his negroes, is not\noffended when kindness and humanity are commended. Every time the\nabolitionist speaks of justice, the anti-abolitionist assents says, yes,\nI wish the world were filled with a disposition to render to every man\nwhat is rightfully due him; I should then get what is due me. That’s\nright; let us have justice. By all means, let us have justice. Every\ntime the abolitionist speaks in honor of human liberty, he touches\na chord in the heart of the anti-abolitionist, which responds in\nharmonious vibrations. Liberty--yes, that is evidently my right, and let\nhim beware who attempts to invade or abridge that right. Every time he\nspeaks of love, of human brotherhood, and the reciprocal duties of\nman and man, the anti-abolitionist assents--says, yes, all right--all\ntrue--we cannot have such ideas too often, or too fully expressed. So he\nsays, and so he feels, and only shows thereby that he is a man as well\nas an anti-abolitionist. You have only to keep out of sight the\nmanner of applying your principles, to get them endorsed every time.\nContemplating himself, he sees truth with absolute clearness and\ndistinctness. He only blunders when asked to lose sight of himself. In\nhis own cause he can beat a Boston lawyer, but he is dumb when asked to\nplead the cause of others. He knows very well whatsoever he would have\ndone unto himself, but is quite in doubt as to having the{367} same\nthing done unto others. It is just here, that lions spring up in the\npath of duty, and the battle once fought in heaven is refought on the\nearth. So it is, so hath it ever been, and so must it ever be, when\nthe claims of justice and mercy make their demand at the door of human\nselfishness. Nevertheless, there is that within which ever pleads for\nthe right and the just.\n\nIn conclusion, I have taken a sober view of the present anti-slavery\nmovement. I am sober, but not hopeless. There is no denying, for it is\neverywhere admitted, that the anti-slavery question is the great moral\nand social question now before the American people. A state of things\nhas gradually been developed, by which that question has become the\nfirst thing in order. It must be met. Herein is my hope. The great\nidea of impartial liberty is now fairly before the American people.\nAnti-slavery is no longer a thing to be prevented. The time for\nprevention is past. This is great gain. When the movement was younger\nand weaker--when it wrought in a Boston garret to human apprehension, it\nmight have been silently put out of the way. Things are different now.\nIt has grown too large--its friends are too numerous--its facilities too\nabundant--its ramifications too extended--its power too omnipotent, to\nbe snuffed out by the contingencies of infancy. A thousand strong men\nmight be struck down, and its ranks still be invincible. One flash from\nthe heart-supplied intellect of Harriet Beecher Stowe could light a\nmillion camp fires in front of the embattled host of slavery, which not\nall the waters of the Mississippi, mingled as they are with blood, could\nextinguish. The present will be looked to by after coming generations,\nas the age of anti-slavery literature--when supply on the gallop could\nnot keep pace with the ever growing demand--when a picture of a Negro\non the cover was a help to the sale of a book--when conservative lyceums\nand other American literary associations began first to select their\norators for distinguished occasions from the ranks of the previously\ndespised abolitionists. If the anti-slavery movement shall fail now,\nit will not be from outward opposition, but from inward decay. Its\nauxiliaries are everywhere. Scholars, authors, orators, poets, and\nstatesmen give it their aid. The most brilliant of American poets\nvolunteer in its service. Whittier speaks in burning verse to more than\nthirty thousand, in the National Era. Your own Longfellow whispers, in\nevery hour of trial and disappointment, “labor and wait.” James Russell\nLowell is reminding us that “men are more than institutions.” Pierpont\ncheers the heart of the pilgrim in search of liberty, by singing the\npraises of “the north star.” Bryant, too, is with us; and though chained\nto the car of party, and dragged on amidst a whirl of{368} political\nexcitement, he snatches a moment for letting drop a smiling verse of\nsympathy for the man in chains. The poets are with us. It would seem\nalmost absurd to say it, considering the use that has been made of them,\nthat we have allies in the Ethiopian songs; those songs that constitute\nour national music, and without which we have no national music. They\nare heart songs, and the finest feelings of human nature are expressed\nin them. “Lucy Neal,” “Old Kentucky Home,” and “Uncle Ned,” can make\nthe heart sad as well as merry, and can call forth a tear as well as a\nsmile. They awaken the sympathies for the slave, in which antislavery\nprinciples take root, grow, and flourish. In addition to authors, poets,\nand scholars at home, the moral sense of the civilized world is with\nus. England, France, and Germany, the three great lights of modern\ncivilization, are with us, and every American traveler learns to regret\nthe existence of slavery in his country. The growth of intelligence,\nthe influence of commerce, steam, wind, and lightning are our allies.\nIt would be easy to amplify this summary, and to swell the vast\nconglomeration of our material forces; but there is a deeper and truer\nmethod of measuring the power of our cause, and of comprehending its\nvitality. This is to be found in its accordance with the best elements\nof human nature. It is beyond the power of slavery to annihilate\naffinities recognized and established by the Almighty. The slave is\nbound to mankind by the powerful and inextricable net-work of human\nbrotherhood. His voice is the voice of a man, and his cry is the cry\nof a man in distress, and man must cease to be man before he can become\ninsensible to that cry. It is the righteous of the cause--the humanity\nof the cause--which constitutes its potency. As one genuine bankbill is\nworth more than a thousand counterfeits, so is one man, with right on\nhis side, worth more than a thousand in the wrong. “One may chase a\nthousand, and put ten thousand to flight.” It is, therefore, upon the\ngoodness of our cause, more than upon all other auxiliaries, that we\ndepend for its final triumph.\n\nAnother source of congratulations is the fact that, amid all the efforts\nmade by the church, the government, and the people at large, to stay\nthe onward progress of this movement, its course has been onward, steady,\nstraight, unshaken, and unchecked from the beginning. Slavery has\ngained victories large and numerous; but never as against this\nmovement--against a temporizing policy, and against northern timidity,\nthe slave power has been victorious; but against the spread and\nprevalence in the country, of a spirit of resistance to its aggression,\nand of sentiments favorable to its entire overthrow, it has yet\naccomplished nothing. Every measure, yet devised and executed, having\nfor its object the suppression{369} of anti-slavery, has been as idle\nand fruitless as pouring oil to extinguish fire. A general rejoicing\ntook place on the passage of “the compromise measures” of 1850. Those\nmeasures were called peace measures, and were afterward termed by both\nthe great parties of the country, as well as by leading statesmen, a\nfinal settlement of the whole question of slavery; but experience has\nlaughed to scorn the wisdom of pro-slavery statesmen; and their final\nsettlement of agitation seems to be the final revival, on a broader\nand grander scale than ever before, of the question which they vainly\nattempted to suppress forever. The fugitive slave bill has especially\nbeen of positive service to the anti-slavery movement. It has\nillustrated before all the people the horrible character of slavery\ntoward the slave, in hunting him down in a free state, and tearing\nhim away from wife and children, thus setting its claims higher\nthan marriage or parental claims. It has revealed the arrogant and\noverbearing spirit of the slave states toward the free states; despising\ntheir principles--shocking their feelings of humanity, not only by\nbringing before them the abominations of slavery, but by attempting to\nmake them parties to the crime. It has called into exercise among the\ncolored people, the hunted ones, a spirit of manly resistance well\ncalculated to surround them with a bulwark of sympathy and respect\nhitherto unknown. For men are always disposed to respect and defend\nrights, when the victims of oppression stand up manfully for themselves.\n\nThere is another element of power added to the anti-slavery movement, of\ngreat importance; it is the conviction, becoming every day more general\nand universal, that slavery must be abolished at the south, or it will\ndemoralize and destroy liberty at the north. It is the nature of\nslavery to beget a state of things all around it favorable to its\nown continuance. This fact, connected with the system of bondage, is\nbeginning to be more fully realized. The slave-holder is not satisfied\nto associate with men in the church or in the state, unless he can\nthereby stain them with the blood of his slaves. To be a slave-holder\nis to be a propagandist from necessity; for slavery can only live by\nkeeping down the under-growth morality which nature supplies. Every\nnew-born white babe comes armed from the Eternal presence, to make war\non slavery. The heart of pity, which would melt in due time over\nthe brutal chastisements it sees inflicted on the helpless, must be\nhardened. And this work goes on every day in the year, and every hour in\nthe day.\n\nWhat is done at home is being done also abroad here in the north. And\neven now the question may be asked, have we at this moment a single\nfree state in the Union? The alarm at this point will become more\ngeneral.{370} The slave power must go on in its career of exactions.\nGive, give, will be its cry, till the timidity which concedes shall give\nplace to courage, which shall resist. Such is the voice of experience,\nsuch has been the past, such is the present, and such will be that\nfuture, which, so sure as man is man, will come. Here I leave\nthe subject; and I leave off where I began, consoling myself\nand congratulating the friends of freedom upon the fact that the\nanti-slavery cause is not a new thing under the sun; not some moral\ndelusion which a few years’ experience may dispel. It has appeared\namong men in all ages, and summoned its advocates from all ranks. Its\nfoundations are laid in the deepest and holiest convictions, and from\nwhatever soul the demon, selfishness, is expelled, there will this cause\ntake up its abode. Old as the everlasting hills; immovable as the\nthrone of God; and certain as the purposes of eternal power, against all\nhinderances, and against all delays, and despite all the mutations\nof human instrumentalities, it is the faith of my soul, that this\nanti-slavery cause will triumph.\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Letter, Introduction to _Life of Frederick Douglass_, Boston, 1841.]\n\n[Footnote 2: One of these ladies, impelled by the same noble spirit which\ncarried Miss Nightingale to Scutari, has devoted her time, her untiring\nenergies, to a great extent her means, and her high literary abilities,\nto the advancement and support of Frederick Douglass’ Paper, the only\norgan of the downtrodden, edited and published by one of themselves, in\nthe United States.]\n\n[Footnote 3: Mr. Stephen Myers, of Albany, deserves mention as one of the most\npersevering among the colored editorial fraternity.]\n\n[Footnote 4: The German physiologists have even discovered vegetable\nmatter--starch--in the human body.
