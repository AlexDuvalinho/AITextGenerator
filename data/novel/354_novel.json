FIRST MEMORIES\n\nMy father's ancestors were the Shaws of Rothiemurchus, in Scotland,\nand the ruins of their castle may still be seen on the island of\nLoch-an-Eilan, in the northern Highlands. It was never the picturesque\ncastle of song and story, this home of the fighting Shaws, but an\naustere fortress, probably built in Roman times; and even to-day the\ncrumbling walls which alone are left of it show traces of the relentless\nassaults upon them. Of these the last and the most successful were made\nin the seventeenth century by the Grants and Rob Roy; and it was into\nthe hands of the Grants that the Shaw fortress finally fell, about 1700,\nafter almost a hundred years of ceaseless warfare.\n\nIt gives me no pleasure to read the grisly details of their struggles,\nbut I confess to a certain satisfaction in the knowledge that my\nancestors made a good showing in the defense of what was theirs. Beyond\ndoubt they were brave fighters and strong men. There were other sides to\ntheir natures, however, which the high lights of history throw up\nless appealingly. As an instance, we have in the family chronicles the\nblood-stained page of Allen Shaw, the oldest son of the last Lady Shaw\nwho lived in the fortress. It appears that when the father of this\nyoung man died, about 1560, his mother married again, to the intense\ndisapproval of her son. For some time after the marriage he made no open\nrevolt against the new-comer in the domestic circle; but finally, on the\npretext that his dog had been attacked by his stepfather, he forced a\nquarrel with the older man and the two fought a duel with swords, after\nwhich the victorious Allen showed a sad lack of chivalry. He not only\nkilled his stepfather, but he cut off that gentleman's head and bore it\nto his mother in her bedchamber--an action which was considered, even in\nthat tolerant age, to be carrying filial resentment too far.\n\nProbably Allen regretted it. Certainly he paid a high penalty for it,\nand his clan suffered with him. He was outlawed and fled, only to be\nhunted down for months, and finally captured and executed by one of the\nGrants, who, in further virtuous disapproval of Allen's act, seized and\nheld the Shaw stronghold. The other Shaws of the clan fought long and\nably for its recovery, but though they were helped by their kinsmen, the\nMackintoshes, and though good Scotch blood dyed the gray walls of the\nfortress for many generations, the castle never again came into the\nhands of the Shaws. It still entails certain obligations for the Grants,\nhowever, and one of these is to give the King of England a snowball\nwhenever he visits Loch-an-Eilan!\n\nAs the years passed the Shaw clan scattered. Many Shaws are still to be\nfound in the Mackintosh country and throughout southern Scotland. Others\nwent to England, and it was from this latter branch that my father\nsprang. His name was Thomas Shaw, and he was the younger son of a\ngentleman--a word which in those days seemed to define a man who devoted\nhis time largely to gambling and horse-racing. My grandfather, like his\nfather before him, was true to the traditions of his time and class.\nQuite naturally and simply he squandered all he had, and died abruptly,\nleaving his wife and two sons penniless. They were not, however, a\nhelpless band. They, too, had their traditions, handed down by the\nfighting Shaws. Peter, the older son, became a soldier, and died bravely\nin the Crimean War. My father, through some outside influence, turned\nhis attention to trade, learning to stain and emboss wallpaper by hand,\nand developing this work until he became the recognized expert in\nhis field. Indeed, he progressed until he himself checked his rise by\ninventing a machine that made his handwork unnecessary. His employer at\nonce claimed and utilized this invention, to which, by the laws of those\ndays, he was entitled, and thus the cornerstone on which my father had\nexpected to build a fortune proved the rock on which his career was\nwrecked. But that was years later, in America, and many other things had\nhappened first.\n\nFor one, he had temporarily dropped his trade and gone into the\nflour-and-grain business; and, for another, he had married my mother.\nShe was the daughter of a Scotch couple who had come to England and\nsettled in Alnwick, in Northumberland County. Her father, James Stott,\nwas the driver of the royal-mail stage between Alnwick and Newcastle,\nand his accidental death while he was still a young man left my\ngrandmother and her eight children almost destitute. She was immediately\ngiven a position in the castle of the Duke of Northumberland, and\nher sons were educated in the duke's school, while her daughters were\nentered in the school of the duchess.\n\nMy thoughts dwell lovingly on this grandmother, Nicolas Grant Stott, for\nshe was a remarkable woman, with a dauntless soul and progressive ideas\nfar in advance of her time. She was one of the first Unitarians in\nEngland, and years before any thought of woman suffrage entered the\nminds of her country-women she refused to pay tithes to the support of\nthe Church of England--an action which precipitated a long-drawn-out\nconflict between her and the law. In those days it was customary to\nassess tithes on every pane of glass in a window, and a portion of the\nmoney thus collected went to the support of the Church. Year after year\nmy intrepid grandmother refused to pay these assessments, and year after\nyear she sat pensively upon her door-step, watching articles of her\nfurniture being sold for money to pay her tithes. It must have been\nan impressive picture, and it was one with which the community became\nthoroughly familiar, as the determined old lady never won her fight and\nnever abandoned it. She had at least the comfort of public sympathy, for\nshe was by far the most popular woman in the countryside. Her neighbors\nadmired her courage; perhaps they appreciated still more what she did\nfor them, for she spent all her leisure in the homes of the very poor,\nmending their clothing and teaching them to sew. Also, she left behind\nher a path of cleanliness as definite as the line of foam that follows\na ship; for it soon became known among her protegees that Nicolas Stott\nwas as much opposed to dirt as she was to the payment of tithes.\n\nShe kept her children in the schools of the duke and duchess until they\nhad completed the entire course open to them. A hundred times, and among\nmany new scenes and strange people, I have heard my mother describe her\nown experiences as a pupil. All the children of the dependents of the\ncastle were expected to leave school at fourteen years of age. During\ntheir course they were not allowed to study geography, because, in the\nsage opinion of their elders, knowledge of foreign lands might make\nthem discontented and inclined to wander. Neither was composition\nencouraged--that might lead to the writing of love-notes! But they were\npermitted to absorb all the reading and arithmetic their little brains\ncould hold, while the art of sewing was not only encouraged, but\nproficiency in it was stimulated by the award of prizes. My mother,\nbeing a rather precocious young person, graduated at thirteen and\ncarried off the first prize. The garment she made was a linen chemise\nfor the duchess, and the little needlewoman had embroidered on it, with\nher own hair, the august lady's coat of arms. The offering must have\nbeen appreciated, for my mother's story always ended with the same\nwords, uttered with the same air of gentle pride, \"And the duchess\ngave me with her own hands my Bible and my mug of beer!\" She never saw\nanything amusing in this association of gifts, and I always stood behind\nher when she told the incident, that she might not see the disrespectful\nmirth it aroused in me.\n\nMy father and mother met in Alnwick, and were married in February, 1835.\nTen years after his marriage father was forced into bankruptcy by the\npassage of the corn law, and to meet the obligations attending\nhis failure he and my mother sold practically everything they\npossessed--their home, even their furniture. Their little sons, who were\naway at school, were brought home, and the family expenses were cut down\nto the barest margin; but all these sacrifices paid only part of the\ndebts. My mother, finding that her early gift had a market value, took\nin sewing. Father went to work on a small salary, and both my parents\nsaved every penny they could lay aside, with the desperate determination\nto pay their remaining debts. It was a long struggle and a painful one,\nbut they finally won it. Before they had done so, however, and during\ntheir bleakest days, their baby died, and my mother, like her mother\nbefore her, paid the penalty of being outside the fold of the Church of\nEngland. She, too, was a Unitarian, and her baby, therefore, could not\nbe laid in any consecrated burial-ground in her neighborhood. She had\neither to bury it in the Potter's Field, with criminals, suicides, and\npaupers, or to take it by stage-coach to Alnwick, twenty miles away, and\nleave it in the little Unitarian churchyard where, after her strenuous\nlife, Nicolas Stott now lay in peace. She made the dreary journey alone,\nwith the dear burden across her lap.\n\nIn 1846, my parents went to London. There they did not linger long,\nfor the big, indifferent city had nothing to offer them. They moved\nto Newcastle-on-Tyne, and here I was born, on the fourteenth day of\nFebruary, in 1847. Three boys and two girls had preceded me in the\nfamily circle, and when I was two years old my younger sister came. We\nwere little better off in Newcastle than in London, and now my father\nbegan to dream the great dream of those days. He would go to America.\nSurely, he felt, in that land of infinite promise all would be well with\nhim and his. He waited for the final payment of his debts and for my\nyounger sister's birth. Then he bade us good-by and sailed away to make\nan American home for us; and in the spring of 1851 my mother followed\nhim with her six children, starting from Liverpool in a sailing-vessel,\nthe John Jacob Westervelt.\n\nI was then little more than four years old, and the first vivid memory\nI have is that of being on shipboard and having a mighty wave roll\nover me. I was lying on what seemed to be an enormous red box under a\nhatchway, and the water poured from above, almost drowning me. This was\nthe beginning of a storm which raged for days, and I still have of it a\nconfused memory, a sort of nightmare, in which strange horrors figure,\nand which to this day haunts me at intervals when I am on the sea. The\nthing that stands out most strongly during that period is the white face\nof my mother, ill in her berth. We were with five hundred emigrants on\nthe lowest deck of the ship but one, and as the storm grew wilder an\nunreasoning terror filled our fellow-passengers. Too ill to protect her\nhelpless brood, my mother saw us carried away from her for hours at a\ntime, on the crests of waves of panic that sometimes approached her\nand sometimes receded, as they swept through the black hole in which\nwe found ourselves when the hatches were nailed down. No madhouse, I am\nsure, could throw more hideous pictures on the screen of life than\nthose which met our childish eyes during the appalling three days of the\nstorm. Our one comfort was the knowledge that our mother was not afraid.\nShe was desperately ill, but when we were able to reach her, to cling\nclose to her for a blessed interval, she was still the sure refuge she\nhad always been.\n\nOn the second day the masts went down, and on the third day the disabled\nship, which now had sprung a leak and was rolling helplessly in the\ntrough of the sea, was rescued by another ship and towed back to\nQueenstown, the nearest port. The passengers, relieved of their\nanxieties, went from their extreme of fear to an equal extreme of\ndrunken celebration. They laughed, sang, and danced, but when we reached\nthe shore many of them returned to the homes they had left, declaring\nthat they had had enough of the ocean. We, however, remained on the ship\nuntil she was repaired, and then sailed on her again. We were too poor\nto return home; indeed, we had no home to which we could return. We were\neven too poor to live ashore. But we made some penny excursions in the\nlittle boats that plied back and forth, and to us children at least\nthe weeks of waiting were not without interest. Among other places we\nvisited Spike Island, where the convicts were, and for hours we watched\nthe dreary shuttle of labor swing back and forth as the convicts carried\npails of water from one side of the island, only to empty them into the\nsea at the other side. It was merely \"busy work,\" to keep them occupied\nat hard labor; but even then I must have felt some dim sense of the\nirony of it, for I have remembered it vividly all these years.\n\nOur second voyage on the John Jacob Westervelt was a very different\nexperience from the first. By day a glorious sun shone overhead; by\nnight we had the moon and stars, as well as the racing waves we never\nwearied of watching. For some reason, probably because of my intense\nadmiration for them, which I showed with unmaidenly frankness, I became\nthe special pet of the sailors. They taught me to sing their songs\nas they hauled on their ropes, and I recall, as if I had learned it\nyesterday, one pleasing ditty:\n\n     Haul on the bow-line,\n     Kitty is my darling,\n     Haul on the bow-line,\n     The bow-line--HAUL!\n\nWhen I sang \"haul\" all the sailors pulled their hardest, and I had\nan exhilarating sense of sharing in their labors. As a return for my\nservice of song the men kept my little apron full of ship sugar--very\nblack stuff and probably very bad for me; but I ate an astonishing\namount of it during that voyage, and, so far as I remember, felt no ill\neffects.\n\nThe next thing I recall is being seriously scalded. I was at the foot\nof a ladder up which a sailor was carrying a great pot of hot coffee. He\nslipped, and the boiling liquid poured down on me. I must have had some\nbad days after that, for I was terribly burned, but they are mercifully\nvague. My next vivid impression is of seeing land, which we sighted at\nsunset, and I remember very distinctly just how it looked. It has never\nlooked the same since. The western sky was a mass of crimson and gold\nclouds, which took on the shapes of strange and beautiful things. To\nme it seemed that we were entering heaven. I remember also the doctors\ncoming on board to examine us, and I can still see a line of big\nIrishmen standing very straight and holding out their tongues for\ninspection. To a little girl only four years old their huge, open mouths\nlooked appalling.\n\nOn landing a grievous disappointment awaited us; my father did not\nmeet us. He was in New Bedford, Massachusetts, nursing his grief and\npreparing to return to England, for he had been told that the John Jacob\nWestervelt had been lost at sea with every soul on board. One of the\nmissionaries who met the ship took us under his wing and conducted us\nto a little hotel, where we remained until father had received his\nincredible news and rushed to New York. He could hardly believe that\nwe were really restored to him; and even now, through the mists of more\nthan half a century, I can still see the expression in his wet eyes as\nhe picked me up and tossed me into the air.\n\nI can see, too, the toys he brought me--a little saw and a hatchet,\nwhich became the dearest treasures of my childish days. They were\nfatidical gifts, that saw and hatchet; in the years ahead of me I was to\nuse tools as well as my brothers did, as I proved when I helped to build\nour frontier home.\n\nWe went to New Bedford with father, who had found work there at his old\ntrade; and here I laid the foundations of my first childhood friendship,\nnot with another child, but with my next-door neighbor, a ship-builder.\nMorning after morning this man swung me on his big shoulder and took\nme to his shipyard, where my hatchet and saw had violent exercise as I\nimitated the workers around me. Discovering that my tiny petticoats were\nin my way, my new friend had a little boy's suit made for me; and thus\nemancipated, at this tender age, I worked unwearyingly at his side all\nday long and day after day. No doubt it was due to him that I did not\ncasually saw off a few of my toes and fingers. Certainly I smashed them\noften enough with blows of my dull but active hatchet. I was very, very\nbusy; and I have always maintained that I began to earn my share of the\nfamily's living at the age of five--for in return for the delights of my\nsociety, which seemed never to pall upon him, my new friend allowed my\nbrothers to carry home from the shipyard all the wood my mother could\nuse.\n\nWe remained in New Bedford less than a year, for in the spring of\n1852 my father made another change, taking his family to Lawrence,\nMassachusetts, where we lived until 1859. The years in Lawrence were\ninteresting and formative ones. At the tender age of nine and ten I\nbecame interested in the Abolition movement. We were Unitarians, and\nGeneral Oliver and many of the prominent citizens of Lawrence belonged\nto the Unitarian Church. We knew Robert Shaw, who led the first negro\nregiment, and Judge Storrow, one of the leading New England judges of\nhis time, as well as the Cabots and George A. Walton, who was the author\nof Walton's Arithmetic and head of the Lawrence schools. Outbursts of\nwar talk thrilled me, and occasionally I had a little adventure of my\nown, as when one day, in visiting our cellar, I heard a noise in the\ncoal-bin. I investigated and discovered a negro woman concealed there.\nI had been reading Uncle Tom's Cabin, as well as listening to the\nconversation of my elders, so I was vastly stirred over the negro\nquestion. I raced up-stairs in a condition of awe-struck and quivering\nexcitement, which my mother promptly suppressed by sending me to bed. No\ndoubt she questioned my youthful discretion, for she almost convinced\nme that I had seen nothing at all--almost, but not quite; and she wisely\nkept me close to her for several days, until the escaped slave my father\nwas hiding was safely out of the house and away. Discovery of this\nserious offense might have borne grave results for him.\n\nIt was in Lawrence, too, that I received and spent my first twenty-five\ncents. I used an entire day in doing this, and the occasion was one of\nthe most delightful and memorable of my life. It was the Fourth of July,\nand I was dressed in white and rode in a procession. My sister Mary, who\nalso graced the procession, had also been given twenty-five cents; and\nduring the parade, when, for obvious reasons, we were unable to break\nranks and spend our wealth, the consciousness of it lay heavily upon\nus. When we finally began our shopping the first place we visited was a\ncandy store, and I recall distinctly that we forced the weary proprietor\nto take down and show us every jar in the place before we spent one\npenny. The first banana I ever ate was purchased that day, and I\nhesitated over it a long time. Its cost was five cents, and in view of\nthat large expenditure, the eating of the fruit, I was afraid, would be\ntoo brief a joy. I bought it, however, and the experience developed into\na tragedy, for, not knowing enough to peel the banana, I bit through\nskin and pulp alike, as if I were eating an apple, and then burst into\nears of disappointment. The beautiful conduct of my sister Mary shines\ndown through the years. She, wise child, had taken no chances with the\nunknown; but now, moved by my despair, she bought half of my banana,\nand we divided the fruit, the loss, and the lesson. Fate, moreover, had\nanother turn of the screw for us, for, after Mary had taken a bite of\nit, we gave what was left of the banana to a boy who stood near us and\nwho knew how to eat it; and not even the large amount of candy in our\nsticky hands enabled us to regard with calmness the subsequent happiness\nof that little boy.\n\nAnother experience with fruit in Lawrence illustrates the ideas of my\nmother and the character of the training she gave her children. Our\nneighbors, the Cabots, were one day giving a great garden party, and\nmy sister was helping to pick strawberries for the occasion. When I was\ngoing home from school I passed the berry-patches and stopped to speak\nto my sister, who at once presented me with two strawberries. She said\nMrs. Cabot had told her to eat all she wanted, but that she would eat\ntwo less than she wanted and give those two to me. To my mind, the\nsuggestion was generous and proper; in my life strawberries were rare.\nI ate one berry, and then, overcome by an ambition to be generous also,\ntook the other berry home to my mother, telling her how I had got it. To\nmy chagrin, mother was deeply shocked. She told me that the transaction\nwas all wrong, and she made me take back the berry and explain the\nmatter to Mrs. Cabot. By the time I reached that generous lady the berry\nwas the worse for its journey, and so was I. I was only nine years old\nand very sensitive. It was clear to me that I could hardly live through\nthe humiliation of the confession, and it was indeed a bitter experience\nthe worst, I think, in my young life, though Mrs. Cabot was both\nsympathetic and understanding. She kissed me, and sent a quart of\nstrawberries to my mother; but for a long time afterward I could not\nmeet her kind eyes, for I believed that in her heart she thought me a\nthief.\n\nMy second friendship, and one which had a strong influence on my\nafter-life, was formed in Lawrence. I was not more than ten years old\nwhen I met this new friend, but the memory of her in after-years, and\nthe impression she had made on my susceptible young mind, led me first\ninto the ministry, next into medicine, and finally into suffrage-work.\nLiving next door to us, on Prospect Hill, was a beautiful and mysterious\nwoman. All we children knew of her was that she was a vivid and romantic\nfigure, who seemed to have no friends and of whom our elders spoke in\nwhispers or not at all. To me she was a princess in a fairy-tale, for\nshe rode a white horse and wore a blue velvet riding-habit with a blue\nvelvet hat and a picturesquely drooping white plume. I soon learned at\nwhat hours she went forth to ride, and I used to hover around our gate\nfor the joy of seeing her mount and gallop away. I realized that there\nwas something unusual about her house, and I had an idea that the prince\nwas waiting for her somewhere in the far distance, and that for the time\nat least she had escaped the ogre in the castle she left behind. I was\nwrong about the prince, but right about the ogre. It was only when my\nunhappy lady left her castle that she was free.\n\nVery soon she noticed me. Possibly she saw the adoration in my childish\neyes. She began to nod and smile at me, and then to speak to me, but at\nfirst I was almost afraid to answer her. There were stories now among\nthe children that the house was haunted, and that by night a ghost\nwalked there and in the grounds. I felt an extraordinary interest in\nthe ghost, and I spent hours peering through our picket fence, trying\nto catch a glimpse of it; but I hesitated to be on terms of neighborly\nintimacy with one who dwelt with ghosts.\n\nOne day the mysterious lady bent and kissed me. Then, straightening up,\nshe looked at me queerly and said: \"Go and tell your mother I did that.\"\nThere was something very compelling in her manner. I knew at once that I\nmust tell my mother what she had done, and I ran into our house and did\nso. While my mother was considering the problem the situation presented,\nfor she knew the character of the house next door, a note was handed in\nto her--a very pathetic little note from my mysterious lady, asking my\nmother to let me come and see her. Long afterward mother showed it to\nme. It ended with the words: \"She will see no one but me. No harm shall\ncome to her. Trust me.\"\n\nThat night my parents talked the matter over and decided to let me go.\nProbably they felt that the slave next door was as much to be pitied as\nthe escaped-negro slaves they so often harbored in our home. I made my\nvisit, which was the first of many, and a strange friendship began and\ndeveloped between the woman of the town and the little girl she loved.\nSome of those visits I remember as vividly as if I had made them\nyesterday. There was never the slightest suggestion during any of them\nof things I should not see or hear, for while I was with her my hostess\nbecame a child again, and we played together like children. She had\nwonderful toys for me, and pictures and books; but the thing I loved\nbest of all and played with for hours was a little stuffed hen which she\ntold me had been her dearest treasure when she was a child at home. She\nhad also a stuffed puppy, and she once mentioned that those two things\nalone were left of her life as a little girl. Besides the toys and books\nand pictures, she gave me ice-cream and cake, and told me fairy-tales.\nShe had a wonderful understanding of what a child likes. There were half\na dozen women in the house with her, but I saw none of them nor any of\nthe men who came.\n\nOnce, when we had become very good friends indeed and my early shyness\nhad departed, I found courage to ask her where the ghost was--the ghost\nthat haunted her house. I can still see the look in her eyes as they\nmet mine. She told me the ghost lived in her heart, and that she did\nnot like to talk about it, and that we must not speak of it again. After\nthat I never mentioned it, but I was more deeply interested than ever,\nfor a ghost that lived in a heart was a new kind of ghost to me at\nthat time, though I have met many of them since then. During all our\nintercourse my mother never entered the house next door, nor did my\nmysterious lady enter our home; but she constantly sent my mother secret\ngifts for the poor and the sick of the neighborhood, and she was always\nthe first to offer help for those who were in trouble. Many years\nafterward mother told me she was the most generous woman she had ever\nknown, and that she had a rarely beautiful nature. Our departure for\nMichigan broke up the friendship, but I have never forgotten her; and\nwhenever, in my later work as minister, physician, and suffragist, I\nhave been able to help women of the class to which she belonged, I have\nmentally offered that help for credit in the tragic ledger of her life,\nin which the clean and the blotted pages were so strange a contrast.\n\nOne more incident of Lawrence I must describe before I leave that city\nbehind me, as we left it for ever in 1859. While we were still there\na number of Lawrence men decided to go West, and amid great public\nexcitement they departed in a body for Kansas, where they founded the\ntown of Lawrence in that state. I recall distinctly the public interest\nwhich attended their going, and the feeling every one seemed to have\nthat they were passing forever out of the civilized world. Their\nfarewells to their friends were eternal; no one expected to see them\nagain, and my small brain grew dizzy as I tried to imagine a place so\nremote as their destination. It was, I finally decided, at the\nuttermost ends of the earth, and it seemed quite possible that the brave\nadventurers who reached it might then drop off into space. Fifty years\nlater I was talking to a California girl who complained lightly of the\nmonotony of a climate where the sun shone and the flowers bloomed all\nthe year around. \"But I had a delightful change last year,\" she added,\nwith animation. \"I went East for the winter.\"\n\n\"To New York?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" corrected the California girl, easily, \"to Lawrence, Kansas.\"\n\nNothing, I think, has ever made me feel quite so old as that remark.\nThat in my life, not yet, to me at least, a long one, I should see such\nan arc described seemed actually oppressive until I realized that,\nafter all, the arc was merely a rainbow of time showing how gloriously\nrealized were the hopes of the Lawrence pioneers.\n\nThe move to Michigan meant a complete upheaval in our lives. In Lawrence\nwe had around us the fine flower of New England civilization. We\nchildren went to school; our parents, though they were in very humble\ncircumstances, were associated with the leading spirits and the\nbig movements of the day. When we went to Michigan we went to the\nwilderness, to the wild pioneer life of those times, and we were all old\nenough to keenly feel the change.\n\nMy father was one of a number of Englishmen who took up tracts in the\nnorthern forests of Michigan, with the old dream of establishing a\ncolony there. None of these men had the least practical knowledge\nof farming. They were city men or followers of trades which had\nno connection with farm life. They went straight into the thick\ntimber-land, instead of going to the rich and waiting prairies, and they\ncrowned this initial mistake by cutting down the splendid timber instead\nof letting it stand. Thus bird's-eye maple and other beautiful woods\nwere used as fire-wood and in the construction of rude cabins, and the\ngreatest asset of the pioneers was ignored.\n\nFather preceded us to the Michigan woods, and there, with his oldest\nson, James, took up a claim. They cleared a space in the wilderness just\nlarge enough for a log cabin, and put up the bare walls of the cabin\nitself. Then father returned to Lawrence and his work, leaving James\nbehind. A few months later (this was in 1859), my mother, my two\nsisters, Eleanor and Mary, my youngest brother, Henry, eight years of\nage, and I, then twelve, went to Michigan to work on and hold down the\nclaim while father, for eighteen months longer, stayed on in Lawrence,\nsending us such remittances as he could. His second and third sons, John\nand Thomas, remained in the East with him.\n\nEvery detail of our journey through the wilderness is clear in my mind.\nAt that time the railroad terminated at Grand Rapids, Michigan, and\nwe covered the remaining distance--about one hundred miles--by wagon,\nriding through a dense and often trackless forest. My brother James met\nus at Grand Rapids with what, in those days, was called a lumber-wagon,\nbut which had a horrible resemblance to a vehicle from the health\ndepartment. My sisters and I gave it one cold look and turned from\nit; we were so pained by its appearance that we refused to ride in it\nthrough the town. Instead, we started off on foot, trying to look as if\nwe had no association with it, and we climbed into the unwieldy vehicle\nonly when the city streets were far behind us. Every available inch of\nspace in the wagon was filled with bedding and provisions. As yet we\nhad no furniture; we were to make that for ourselves when we reached\nour cabin; and there was so little room for us to ride that we children\nwalked by turns, while James, from the beginning of the journey to its\nend, seven days later, led our weary horses.\n\nTo my mother, who was never strong, the whole experience must have been\na nightmare of suffering and stoical endurance. For us children there\nwere compensations. The expedition took on the character of a high\nadventure, in which we sometimes had shelter and sometimes failed\nto find it, sometimes were fed, but often went hungry. We forded\ninnumerable streams, the wheels of the heavy wagon sinking so deeply\ninto the stream-beds that we often had to empty our load before we could\nget them out again. Fallen trees lay across our paths, rivers caused\nlong detours, while again and again we lost our way or were turned aside\nby impenetrable forest tangles.\n\nOur first day's journey covered less than eight miles, and that night we\nstopped at a farm-house which was the last bit of civilization we saw.\nEarly the next morning we were off again, making the slow progress due\nto the rough roads and our heavy load. At night we stopped at a place\ncalled Thomas's Inn, only to be told by the woman who kept it that\nthere was nothing in the house to eat. Her husband, she said, had gone\n\"outside\" (to Grand Rapids) to get some flour, and had not returned--but\nshe added that we could spend the night, if we chose, and enjoy shelter,\nif not food. We had provisions in our wagon, so we wearily entered,\nafter my brother had got out some of our pork and opened a barrel of\nflour. With this help the woman made some biscuits, which were so green\nthat my poor mother could not eat them. She had admitted to us that\nthe one thing she had in the house was saleratus, and she had used this\ningredient with an unsparing hand. When the meal was eaten she broke the\nfurther news that there were no beds.\n\n\"The old woman can sleep with me,\" she suggested, \"and the girls can\nsleep on the floor. The boys will have to go to the barn.\" She and her\nbed were not especially attractive, and mother decided to lie on the\nfloor with us. We had taken our bedding from the wagon, and we slept\nvery well; but though she was usually superior to small annoyances, I\nthink my mother resented being called an \"old woman.\" She must have felt\nlike one that night, but she was only about forty-eight years of age.\n\nAt dawn the next morning we resumed our journey, and every day after\nthat we were able to cover the distance demanded by the schedule\narranged before we started. This meant that some sort of shelter usually\nawaited us at night. But one day we knew there would be no houses\nbetween the place we left in the morning and that where we were to\nsleep. The distance was about twenty miles, and when twilight fell we\nhad not made it. In the back of the wagon my mother had a box of little\npigs, and during the afternoon these had broken loose and escaped\ninto the woods. We had lost much time in finding them, and we were so\nexhausted that when we came to a hut made of twigs and boughs we decided\nto camp in it for the night, though we knew nothing about it. My brother\nhad unharnessed the horses, and my mother and sister were cooking\ndough-god--a mixture of flour, water, and soda, fried in a pan-when two\nmen rode up on horseback and called my brother to one side. Immediately\nafter the talk which followed James harnessed his horses again and\nforced us to go on, though by that time darkness had fallen. He told\nmother, but did not tell us children until long afterward, that a man\nhad been murdered in the hut only the night before. The murderer was\nstill at large in the woods, and the new-comers were members of a posse\nwho were searching for him. My brother needed no urging to put as many\nmiles as he could between us and the sinister spot.\n\nIn that fashion we made our way to our new home. The last day, like the\nfirst, we traveled only eight miles, but we spent the night in a house\nI shall never forget. It was beautifully clean, and for our evening meal\nits mistress brought out loaves of bread which were the largest we had\never seen. She cut great slices of this bread for us and spread maple\nsugar on them, and it seemed to us that never before had anything tasted\nso good.\n\nThe next morning we made the last stage of our journey, our hearts\nfilled with the joy of nearing our new home. We all had an idea that we\nwere going to a farm, and we expected some resemblance at least to the\nprosperous farms we had seen in New England. My mother's mental picture\nwas, naturally, of an English farm. Possibly she had visions of red\nbarns and deep meadows, sunny skies and daisies. What we found awaiting\nus were the four walls and the roof of a good-sized log-house, standing\nin a small cleared strip of the wilderness, its doors and windows\nrepresented by square holes, its floor also a thing of the future, its\nwhole effect achingly forlorn and desolate. It was late in the afternoon\nwhen we drove up to the opening that was its front entrance, and I shall\nnever forget the look my mother turned upon the place. Without a word\nshe crossed its threshold, and, standing very still, looked slowly\naround her. Then something within her seemed to give way, and she sank\nupon the ground. She could not realize even then, I think, that this was\nreally the place father had prepared for us, that here he expected us to\nlive. When she finally took it in she buried her face in her hands, and\nin that way she sat for hours without moving or speaking. For the first\ntime in her life she had forgotten us; and we, for our part, dared not\nspeak to her. We stood around her in a frightened group, talking to one\nanother in whispers. Our little world had crumbled under our feet. Never\nbefore had we seen our mother give way to despair.\n\nNight began to fall. The woods became alive with night creatures, and\nthe most harmless made the most noise. The owls began to hoot, and\nsoon we heard the wildcat, whose cry--a screech like that of a lost and\npanic-stricken child--is one of the most appalling sounds of the forest.\nLater the wolves added their howls to the uproar, but though darkness\ncame and we children whimpered around her, our mother still sat in her\nstrange lethargy.\n\nAt last my brother brought the horses close to the cabin and built fires\nto protect them and us. He was only twenty, but he showed himself a man\nduring those early pioneer days. While he was picketing the horses and\nbuilding his protecting fires my mother came to herself, but her face\nwhen she raised it was worse than her silence had been. She seemed to\nhave died and to have returned to us from the grave, and I am sure she\nfelt that she had done so. From that moment she took up again the burden\nof her life, a burden she did not lay down until she passed away; but\nher face never lost the deep lines those first hours of her pioneer life\nhad cut upon it.\n\nThat night we slept on boughs spread on the earth inside the cabin\nwalls, and we put blankets before the holes which represented our doors\nand windows, and kept our watch-fires burning. Soon the other children\nfell asleep, but there was no sleep for me. I was only twelve years old,\nbut my mind was full of fancies. Behind our blankets, swaying in the\nnight wind, I thought I saw the heads and pushing shoulders of animals\nand heard their padded footfalls. Later years brought familiarity with\nwild things, and with worse things than they. But to-night that which I\nmost feared was within, not outside of, the cabin. In some way which I\ndid not understand the one sure refuge in our new world had been taken\nfrom us. I hardly knew the silent woman who lay near me, tossing from\nside to side and staring into the darkness; I felt that we had lost our\nmother.\n\n\n\n\nII. IN THE WILDERNESS\n\nLike most men, my dear father should never have married. Though his\nnature was one of the sweetest I have ever known, and though he would\nat any call give his time to or risk his life for others, in practical\nmatters he remained to the end of his days as irresponsible as a child.\nIf his mind turned to practical details at all, it was solely in their\nbearing toward great developments of the future. To him an acorn was not\nan acorn, but a forest of young oaks.\n\nThus, when he took up his claim of three hundred and sixty acres of\nland in the wilderness of northern Michigan, and sent my mother and\nfive young children to live there alone until he could join us eighteen\nmonths later, he gave no thought to the manner in which we were to make\nthe struggle and survive the hardships before us. He had furnished us\nwith land and the four walls of a log cabin. Some day, he reasoned, the\nplace would be a fine estate, which his sons would inherit and in\nthe course of time pass on to their sons--always an Englishman's most\niridescent dream. That for the present we were one hundred miles from\na railroad, forty miles from the nearest post-office, and half a dozen\nmiles from any neighbors save Indians, wolves, and wildcats; that we\nwere wholly unlearned in the ways of the woods as well as in the most\nprimitive methods of farming; that we lacked not only every comfort, but\neven the bare necessities of life; and that we must begin, single-handed\nand untaught, a struggle for existence in which some of the severest\nforces of nature would be arrayed against us--these facts had no weight\nin my father's mind. Even if he had witnessed my mother's despair on the\nnight of our arrival in our new home, he would not have understood it.\nFrom his viewpoint, he was doing a man's duty. He was working steadily\nin Lawrence, and, incidentally, giving much time to the Abolition cause\nand to other big public movements of his day which had his interest and\nsympathy. He wrote to us regularly and sent us occasional remittances,\nas well as a generous supply of improving literature for our minds.\nIt remained for us to strengthen our bodies, to meet the conditions in\nwhich he had placed us, and to survive if we could.\n\nWe faced our situation with clear and unalarmed eyes the morning after\nour arrival. The problem of food, we knew, was at least temporarily\nsolved. We had brought with us enough coffee, pork, and flour to last\nfor several weeks; and the one necessity father had put inside the cabin\nwalls was a great fireplace, made of mud and stones, in which our food\ncould be cooked. The problem of our water-supply was less simple, but\nmy brother James solved it for the time by showing us a creek a long\ndistance from the house; and for months we carried from this creek, in\npails, every drop of water we used, save that which we caught in troughs\nwhen the rain fell.\n\nWe held a family council after breakfast, and in this, though I was only\ntwelve, I took an eager and determined part. I loved work--it has\nalways been my favorite form of recreation--and my spirit rose to the\nopportunities of it which smiled on us from every side. Obviously the\nfirst thing to do was to put doors and windows into the yawning holes\nfather had left for them, and to lay a board flooring over the earth\ninside our cabin walls, and these duties we accomplished before we had\noccupied our new home a fortnight. There was a small saw-mill nine miles\nfrom our cabin, on the spot that is now Big Rapids, and there we bought\nour lumber. The labor we supplied ourselves, and though we put our\nhearts into it and the results at the time seemed beautiful to our\npartial eyes, I am forced to admit, in looking back upon them, that they\nhalted this side of perfection. We began by making three windows and two\ndoors; then, inspired by these achievements, we ambitiously constructed\nan attic and divided the ground floor with partitions, which gave us\nfour rooms.\n\nThe general effect was temperamental and sketchy. The boards which\nformed the floor were never even nailed down; they were fine, wide\nplanks without a knot in them, and they looked so well that we merely\nfitted them together as closely as we could and lightheartedly let them\ngo at that. Neither did we properly chink the house. Nothing is\nmore comfortable than a log cabin which has been carefully built and\nfinished; but for some reason--probably because there seemed always a\nmore urgent duty calling to us around the corner--we never plastered\nour house at all. The result was that on many future winter mornings we\nawoke to find ourselves chastely blanketed by snow, while the only warm\nspot in our living-room was that directly in front of the fireplace,\nwhere great logs burned all day. Even there our faces scorched while\nour spines slowly congealed, until we learned to revolve before the fire\nlike a bird upon a spit. No doubt we would have worked more thoroughly\nif my brother James, who was twenty years old and our tower of strength,\nhad remained with us; but when we had been in our new home only a few\nmonths he fell and was forced to go East for an operation. He was never\nable to return to us, and thus my mother, we three young girls, and my\nyoungest brother--Harry, who was only eight years old--made our fight\nalone until father came to us, more than a year later.\n\nMother was practically an invalid. She had a nervous affection which\nmade it impossible for her to stand without the support of a chair. But\nshe sewed with unusual skill, and it was due to her that our clothes,\nnotwithstanding the strain to which we subjected them, were always in\ngood condition. She sewed for hours every day, and she was able to move\nabout the house, after a fashion, by pushing herself around on a stool\nwhich James made for her as soon as we arrived. He also built for her a\nmore comfortable chair with a high back.\n\nThe division of labor planned at the first council was that mother\nshould do our sewing, and my older sisters, Eleanor and Mary, the\nhousework, which was far from taxing, for of course we lived in the\nsimplest manner. My brothers and I were to do the work out of doors, an\narrangement that suited me very well, though at first, owing to our lack\nof experience, our activities were somewhat curtailed. It was too late\nin the season for plowing or planting, even if we had possessed anything\nwith which to plow, and, moreover, our so-called \"cleared\" land was\nthick with sturdy tree-stumps. Even during the second summer plowing was\nimpossible; we could only plant potatoes and corn, and follow the most\nprimitive method in doing even this. We took an ax, chopped up the sod,\nput the seed under it, and let the seed grow. The seed did grow, too--in\nthe most gratifying and encouraging manner. Our green corn and potatoes\nwere the best I have ever eaten. But for the present we lacked these\nluxuries.\n\nWe had, however, in their place, large quantities of wild\nfruit--gooseberries, raspberries, and plums--which Harry and I gathered\non the banks of our creek. Harry also became an expert fisherman. We\nhad no hooks or lines, but he took wires from our hoop-skirts and made\nsnares at the ends of poles. My part of this work was to stand on a\nlog and frighten the fish out of their holes by making horrible sounds,\nwhich I did with impassioned earnestness. When the fish hurried to the\nsurface of the water to investigate the appalling noises they had heard,\nthey were easily snared by our small boy, who was very proud of his\nability to contribute in this way to the family table.\n\nDuring our first winter we lived largely on cornmeal, making a little\njourney of twenty miles to the nearest mill to buy it; but even at that\nwe were better off than our neighbors, for I remember one family in our\nregion who for an entire winter lived solely on coarse-grained yellow\nturnips, gratefully changing their diet to leeks when these came in the\nspring.\n\nSuch furniture as we had we made ourselves. In addition to my mother's\ntwo chairs and the bunks which took the place of beds, James made a\nsettle for the living-room, as well as a table and several stools. At\nfirst we had our tree-cutting done for us, but we soon became expert in\nthis gentle art, and I developed such skill that in later years, after\nfather came, I used to stand with him and \"heart\" a log.\n\nOn every side, and at every hour of the day, we came up against the\nrelentless limitations of pioneer life. There was not a team of horses\nin our entire region. The team with which my brother had driven us\nthrough the wilderness had been hired at Grand Rapids for that occasion,\nand, of course, immediately returned. Our lumber was delivered by\nox-teams, and the absolutely essential purchases we made \"outside\" (at\nthe nearest shops, forty miles away) were carried through the forest on\nthe backs of men. Our mail was delivered once a month by a carrier who\nmade the journey in alternate stages of horseback riding and canoeing.\nBut we had health, youth, enthusiasm, good appetites, and the\nwherewithal to satisfy them, and at night in our primitive bunks we\nsank into abysses of dreamless slumber such as I have never known since.\nIndeed, looking back upon them, those first months seem to have been a\nlong-drawn-out and glorious picnic, interrupted only by occasional hours\nof pain or panic, when we were hurt or frightened.\n\nNaturally, our two greatest menaces were wild animals and Indians, but\nas the days passed the first of these lost the early terrors with which\nwe had associated them. We grew indifferent to the sounds that had made\nour first night a horror to us all--there was even a certain homeliness\nin them--while we regarded with accustomed, almost blase eyes the\nvarious furred creatures of which we caught distant glimpses as they\nslunk through the forest. Their experience with other settlers had\ntaught them caution; it soon became clear that they were as eager to\navoid us as we were to shun them, and by common consent we gave each\nother ample elbow-room. But the Indians were all around us, and every\nsettler had a collection of hair-raising tales to tell of them. It was\ngenerally agreed that they were dangerous only when they were drunk;\nbut as they were drunk whenever they could get whisky, and as whisky\nwas constantly given them in exchange for pelts and game, there was a\nharrowing doubt in our minds whenever they approached us.\n\nIn my first encounter with them I was alone in the woods at sunset with\nmy small brother Harry. We were hunting a cow James had bought, and our\nyoung eyes were peering eagerly among the trees, on the alert for any\nmoving object. Suddenly, at a little distance, and coming directly\ntoward us, we saw a party of Indians. There were five of them, all men,\nwalking in single file, as noiselessly as ghosts, their moccasined feet\ncausing not even a rustle among the dry leaves that carpeted the woods.\nAll the horrible stories we had heard of Indian cruelty flashed into\nour minds, and for a moment we were dumb with terror. Then I remembered\nhaving been told that the one thing one must not do before them is to\nshow fear. Harry was carrying a rope with which we had expected to lead\nhome our reluctant cow, and I seized one end of it and whispered to him\nthat we would \"play horse,\" pretending he was driving me. We pranced\ntoward the Indians on feet that felt like lead, and with eyes so glazed\nby terror that we could see nothing save a line of moving figures;\nbut as we passed them they did not give to our little impersonation\nof care-free children even the tribute of a side-glance. They were,\nwe realized, headed straight for our home; and after a few moments we\ndoubled on our tracks and, keeping at a safe distance from them among\nthe trees, ran back to warn our mother that they were coming.\n\nAs it happened, James was away, and mother had to meet her unwelcome\nguests supported only by her young children. She at once prepared a\nmeal, however, and when they arrived she welcomed them calmly and gave\nthem the best she had. After they had eaten they began to point at\nand demand objects they fancied in the room--my brother's pipe, some\ntobacco, a bowl, and such trifles--and my mother, who was afraid to\nannoy them by refusal, gave them what they asked. They were quite\nsober, and though they left without expressing any appreciation of her\nhospitality, they made her a second visit a few months later, bringing a\nlarge quantity of venison and a bag of cranberries as a graceful return.\nThese Indians were Ottawas; and later we became very friendly with them\nand their tribe, even to the degree of attending one of their dances,\nwhich I shall describe later.\n\nOur second encounter with Indians was a less agreeable experience. There\nwere seven \"Marquette warriors\" in the next group of callers, and they\nwere all intoxicated. Moreover, they had brought with them several jugs\nof bad whisky--the raw and craze-provoking product supplied them by the\nfur-dealers--and it was clear that our cabin was to be the scene of an\norgy. Fortunately, my brother James was at home on this occasion, and as\nthe evening grew old and the Indians, grouped together around the fire,\nbecame more and more irresponsible, he devised a plan for our safety.\nOur attic was finished, and its sole entrance was by a ladder through\na trap-door. At James's whispered command my sister Eleanor slipped up\ninto the attic, and from the back window let down a rope, to which he\ntied all the weapons we had--his gun and several axes. These Eleanor\ndrew up and concealed in one of the bunks. My brother then directed that\nas quietly as possible, and at long intervals, one member of the family\nafter another was to slip up the ladder and into the attic, going quite\ncasually, that the Indians might not realize what we were doing. Once\nthere, with the ladder drawn up after us and the trap-door closed, we\nwould be reasonably safe, unless our guests decided to burn the cabin.\n\nThe evening seemed endless, and was certainly nerve-racking. The Indians\nate everything in the house, and from my seat in a dim corner I watched\nthem while my sisters waited on them. I can still see the tableau they\nmade in the firelit room and hear the unfamiliar accents of their speech\nas they talked together. Occasionally one of them would pull a hair from\nhis head, seize his scalping-knife; and cut the hair with it--a most\nunpleasant sight! When either of my sisters approached them some of the\nIndians would make gestures, as if capturing and scalping her. Through\nit all, however, the whisky held their close attention, and it was due\nto this that we succeeded in reaching the attic unobserved, James coming\nlast of all and drawing the ladder after him. Mother and the children\nwere then put to bed; but through that interminable night James and\nEleanor lay flat upon the floor, watching through the cracks between the\nboards the revels of the drunken Indians, which grew wilder with every\nhour that crawled toward sunrise. There was no knowing when they would\nmiss us or how soon their mood might change. At any moment they might\nmake an attack upon us or set fire to the cabin. By dawn, however, their\nwhisky was all gone, and they were in so deep a stupor that, one after\nthe other, the seven fell from their chairs to the floor, where they\nsprawled unconscious. When they awoke they left quietly and without\ntrouble of any kind. They seemed a strangely subdued and chastened band;\nprobably they were wretchedly ill after their debauch on the adulterated\nwhisky the traders had given them.\n\nThat autumn the Ottawa tribe had a great corn celebration, to which we\nand the other settlers were invited. James and my older sisters attended\nit, and I went with them, by my own urgent invitation. It seemed to me\nthat as I was sharing the work and the perils of our new environment,\nI might as well share its joys; and I finally succeeded in making\nmy family see the logic of this position. The central feature of the\nfestivity was a huge kettle, many feet in circumference, into which the\nIndians dropped the most extraordinary variety of food we had ever seen\ncombined. Deer heads went into it whole, as well as every kind of meat\nand vegetable the members of the tribe could procure. We all ate some of\nthis agreeable mixture, and later, with one another, and even with\nthe Indians, we danced gaily to the music of a tom-tom and a drum. The\naffair was extremely interesting until the whisky entered and did its\nunpleasant work. When our hosts began to fall over in the dance and\nslumber where they lay, and when the squaws began to show the same ill\neffects of their refreshments, we unostentatiously slipped away.\n\nDuring the winter life offered us few diversions and many hardships. Our\ncreek froze over, and the water problem became a serious one, which\nwe met with increasing difficulty as the temperature steadily fell. We\nmelted snow and ice, and existed through the frozen months, but with\nan amount of discomfort which made us unwilling to repeat at least that\nspecial phase of our experience. In the spring, therefore, I made a\nwell. Long before this, James had gone, and Harry and I were now the\nonly outdoor members of our working-force. Harry was still too small to\nhelp with the well; but a young man, who had formed the neighborly habit\nof riding eighteen miles to call on us, gave me much friendly aid. We\nlocated the well with a switch, and when we had dug as far as we could\nreach with our spades, my assistant descended into the hole and threw\nthe earth up to the edge, from which I in turn removed it. As the well\ngrew deeper we made a half-way shelf, on which I stood, he throwing the\nearth on the shelf, and I shoveling it up from that point. Later, as he\ndescended still farther into the hole we were making, he shoveled the\nearth into buckets and passed them up to me, I passing them on to my\nsister, who was now pressed into service. When the excavation was deep\nenough we made the wall of slabs of wood, roughly joined together. I\nrecall that well with calm content. It was not a thing of beauty, but\nit was a thoroughly practical well, and it remained the only one we had\nduring the twelve years the family occupied the cabin.\n\nDuring our first year there was no school within ten miles of us, but\nthis lack failed to sadden Harry or me. We had brought with us from\nLawrence a box of books, in which, in winter months, when our outdoor\nwork was restricted, we found much comfort. They were the only books\nin that part of the country, and we read them until we knew them all by\nheart. Moreover, father sent us regularly the New York Independent, and\nwith this admirable literature, after reading it, we papered our walls.\nThus, on stormy days, we could lie on the settle or the floor and read\nthe Independent over again with increased interest and pleasure.\n\nOccasionally father sent us the Ledger, but here mother drew a definite\nline. She had a special dislike for that periodical, and her severest\ncomment on any woman was that she was the type who would \"keep a dog,\nmake saleratus biscuit, and read the New York Ledger in the daytime.\"\nOur modest library also contained several histories of Greece and Rome,\nwhich must have been good ones, for years later, when I entered college,\nI passed my examination in ancient history with no other preparation\nthan this reading. There were also a few arithmetics and algebras, a\nhistorical novel or two, and the inevitable copy of Uncle Tom's Cabin,\nwhose pages I had freely moistened with my tears.\n\nWhen the advantages of public education were finally extended to me,\nat thirteen, by the opening of a school three miles from our home,\nI accepted them with growing reluctance. The teacher was a spinster\nforty-four years of age and the only genuine \"old maid\" I have ever met\nwho was not a married woman or a man. She was the real thing, and\nher name, Prudence Duncan, seemed the fitting label for her rigidly\nuncompromising personality. I graced Prudence's school for three months,\nand then left it at her fervid request. I had walked six miles a day\nthrough trackless woods and Western blizzards to get what she could\ngive me, but she had little to offer my awakened and critical mind.\nMy reading and my Lawrence school-work had already taught me more than\nPrudence knew--a fact we both inwardry--admitted and fiercely resented\nfrom our different viewpoints. Beyond doubt I was a pert and trying\nyoung person. I lost no opportunity to lead Prudence beyond her\nintellectual depth and leave her there, and Prudence vented her chagrin\nnot alone upon me, but upon my little brother. I became a thorn in her\nside, and one day, after an especially unpleasant episode in which Harry\nalso figured, she plucked me out, as it were, and cast me for ever from\nher. From that time I studied at home, where I was a much more valuable\neconomic factor than I had been in school.\n\nThe second spring after our arrival Harry and I extended our operations\nby tapping the sugar-bushes, collecting all the sap, and carrying it\nhome in pails slung from our yoke-laden shoulders. Together we made one\nhundred and fifty pounds of sugar and a barrel of syrup, but here again,\nas always, we worked in primitive ways. To get the sap we chopped a gash\nin the tree and drove in a spile. Then we dug out a trough to catch the\nsap. It was no light task to lift these troughs full of sap and empty\nthe sap into buckets, but we did it successfully, and afterward built\nfires and boiled it down. By this time we had also cleared some of our\nground, and during the spring we were able to plow, dividing the work in\na way that seemed fair to us both. These were strenuous occupations\nfor a boy of nine and a girl of thirteen, but, though we were not\ninordinately good children, we never complained; we found them very\nsatisfactory substitutes for more normal bucolic joys. Inevitably, we\nhad our little tragedies. Our cow died, and for an entire winter we went\nwithout milk. Our coffee soon gave out, and as a substitute we made\nand used a mixture of browned peas and burnt rye. In the winter we were\nalways cold, and the water problem, until we had built our well, was\never with us.\n\nFather joined us at the end of eighteen months, but though his presence\ngave us pleasure and moral support, he was not an addition to our\nexecutive staff. He brought with him a rocking-chair for mother and a\nnew supply of books, on which I fell as a starving man falls upon food.\nFather read as eagerly as I, but much more steadily. His mind was always\nbusy with problems, and if, while he was laboring in the field, a new\nproblem presented itself to him, the imperishable curiosity that was in\nhim made him scurry at once to the house to solve it. I have known him\nto spend a planting season in figuring on the production of a certain\nnumber of kernels of corn, instead of planting the corn and raising\nit. In the winter he was supposed to spend his time clearing land for\norchards and the like, but instead he pored over his books and problems\nday after day and often half the night as well. It soon became known\namong our neighbors, who were rapidly increasing in number, that we had\nbooks and that father like to read aloud, and men walked ten miles or\nmore to spend the night with us and listen to his reading. Often, as his\nfame grew, ten or twelve men would arrive at our cabin on Saturday and\nremain over Sunday. When my mother once tried to check this influx of\nguests by mildly pointing out, among other things, the waste of candles\nrepresented by frequent all-night readings, every man humbly appeared\nagain on the following Saturday with a candle in each hand. They were\nnot sensitive; and, as they had brought their candles, it seemed fitting\nto them and to father that we girls should cook for them and supply them\nwith food.\n\nFather's tolerance of idleness in others, however, did not extend to\ntolerance of idleness in us, and this led to my first rebellion, which\noccurred when I was fourteen. For once, I had been in the woods all day,\nburied in my books; and when I returned at night, still in the dream\nworld these books had opened to me, father was awaiting my coming with\na brow dark with disapproval. As it happened, mother had felt that day\nsome special need of me, and father reproached me bitterly for being\nbeyond reach--an idler who wasted time while mother labored. He ended\na long arraignment by predicting gloomily that with such tendencies I\nwould make nothing of my life.\n\nThe injustice of the criticism cut deep; I knew I had done and was doing\nmy share for the family, and already, too, I had begun to feel the call\nof my career. For some reason I wanted to preach--to talk to people,\nto tell them things. Just why, just what, I did not yet know--but I had\nbegun to preach in the silent woods, to stand up on stumps and address\nthe unresponsive trees, to feel the stir of aspiration within me.\n\nWhen my father had finished all he wished to say, I looked at him and\nanswered, quietly, \"Father, some day I am going to college.\"\n\nI can still see his slight, ironical smile. It drove me to a second\nprediction. I was young enough to measure success by material results,\nso I added, recklessly:\n\n\"And before I die I shall be worth ten thousand dollars!\"\n\nThe amount staggered me even as it dropped from my lips. It was the\nlargest fortune my imagination could conceive, and in my heart I\nbelieved that no woman ever had possessed or would possess so much. So\nfar as I knew, too, no woman had gone to college. But now that I had put\nmy secret hopes into words, I was desperately determined to make those\nhopes come true. After I became a wage-earner I lost my desire to make\na fortune, but the college dream grew with the years; and though my\ncollege career seemed as remote as the most distant star, I hitched my\nlittle wagon to that star and never afterward wholly lost sight of its\nfriendly gleam.\n\nWhen I was fifteen years old I was offered a situation as\nschool-teacher. By this time the community was growing around us with\nthe rapidity characteristic of these Western settlements, and we\nhad nearer neighbors whose children needed instruction. I passed\nan examination before a schoolboard consisting of three nervous and\nself-conscious men whose certificate I still hold, and I at once began\nmy professional career on the modest salary of two dollars a week and my\nboard. The school was four miles from my home, so I \"boarded round\" with\nthe families of my pupils, staying two weeks in each place, and\noften walking from three to six miles a day to and from my little log\nschool-house in every kind of weather. During the first year I had about\nfourteen pupils, of varying ages, sizes, and temperaments, and there was\nhardly a book in the school-room except those I owned. One little girl,\nI remember, read from an almanac, while a second used a hymn-book.\n\nIn winter the school-house was heated by a woodstove, to which the\nteacher had to give close personal attention. I could not depend on\nmy pupils to make the fires or carry in the fuel; and it was often\nnecessary to fetch the wood myself, sometimes for long distances through\nthe forest. Again and again, after miles of walking through winter\nstorms, I reached the school-house with my clothing wet through, and\nin these soaked garments I taught during the day. In \"boarding round\"\nI often found myself in one-room cabins, with bunks at the end and the\nsole partition a sheet or a blanket, behind which I slept with one or\ntwo of the children. It was the custom on these occasions for the man\nof the house to delicately retire to the barn while we women got to bed,\nand to disappear again in the morning while we dressed. In some places\nthe meals were so badly cooked that I could not eat them, and often the\nonly food my poor little pupils brought to school for their noonday meal\nwas a piece of bread or a bit of raw pork.\n\nI earned my two dollars a week that year, but I had to wait for my wages\nuntil the dog tax was collected in the spring. When the money was thus\nraised, and the twenty-six dollars for my thirteen weeks of teaching\nwere graciously put into my hands, I went \"outside\" to the nearest shop\nand joyously spent almost the entire amount for my first \"party dress.\"\nThe gown I bought was, I considered, a beautiful creation. In color it\nwas a rich magenta, and the skirt was elaborately braided with black\ncable-cord. My admiration for it was justified, for it did all a young\ngirl's eager heart could ask of any gown--it led to my first proposal.\n\nThe youth who sought my hand was about twenty years old, and by an\nunhappy chance he was also the least attractive young person in the\ncountryside--the laughing-stock of the neighbors, the butt of his\nassociates. The night he came to offer me his heart there were already\ntwo young men at our home calling on my sisters, and we were all sitting\naround the fire in the living-room when my suitor appeared. His costume,\nlike himself, left much to be desired. He wore a blue flannel shirt and\na pair of trousers made of flour-bags. Such trousers were not uncommon\nin our region, and the boy's mother, who had made them for him, had\nthoughtfully selected a nice clean pair of sacks. But on one leg was\nthe name of the firm that made the flour--A. and G. W. Green--and by a\ncharming coincidence A. and G. W. Green happened to be the two young men\nwho were calling on my sisters! On the back of the bags, directly in the\nrear of the wearer, was the simple legend, \"96 pounds\"; and the striking\neffect of the young man's costume was completed by a bright yellow sash\nwhich held his trousers in place.\n\nThe vision fascinated my sisters and their two guests. They gave\nit their entire attention, and when the new-comer signified with an\neloquent gesture that he was calling on me, and beckoned me into an\ninner room, the quartet arose as one person and followed us to the door.\nThen, as we inhospitably closed the door, they fastened their eyes to\nthe cracks in the living-room wall, that they might miss none of the\nentertainment. When we were alone my guest and I sat down in facing\nchairs and in depressed silence. The young man was nervous, and I was\nboth frightened and annoyed. I had heard suppressed giggles on the other\nside of the wall, and I realized, as my self-centered visitor failed\nto do, that we were not enjoying the privacy the situation seemed to\ndemand. At last the youth informed me that his \"dad\" had just given him\na cabin, a yoke of steers, a cow, and some hens. When this announcement\nhad produced its full effect, he straightened up in his chair and asked,\nsolemnly, \"Will ye have me?\"\n\nAn outburst of chortles from the other side of the wall greeted the\nproposal, but the ardent youth ignored it, if indeed he heard it. With\neyes staring straight ahead, he sat rigid, waiting for my answer; and I,\nanxious only to get rid of him and to end the strain of the moment,\nsaid the first thing that came into my head. \"I can't,\" I told him. \"I'm\nsorry, but--but--I'm engaged.\"\n\nHe rose quickly, with the effect of a half-closed jack-knife that is\nsuddenly opened, and for an instant stood looking down upon me. He was\nsix feet two inches tall, and extremely thin. I am very short, and, as\nI looked up, his flour-bag trousers seemed to join his yellow sash\nsomewhere near the ceiling of the room. He put both hands into\nhis pockets and slowly delivered his valedictory. \"That's darned\ndisappointing to a fellow,\" he said, and left the house. After a\nmoment devoted to regaining my maidenly composure I returned to the\nliving-room, where I had the privilege of observing the enjoyment of\nmy sisters and their visitors. Helpless with mirth and with tears of\npleasure on their cheeks, the four rocked and shrieked as they recalled\nthe picture my gallant had presented. For some time after that incident\nI felt a strong distaste for sentiment.\n\nClad royally in the new gown, I attended my first ball in November,\ngoing with a party of eight that included my two sisters, another girl,\nand four young men. The ball was at Big Rapids, which by this time had\ngrown to be a thriving lumber town. It was impossible to get a team of\nhorses or even a yoke of oxen for the journey, so we made a raft and\nwent down the river on that, taking our party dresses with us in trunks.\nUnfortunately, the raft \"hung up\" in the stream, and the four young men\nhad to get out into the icy water and work a long time before they\ncould detach it from the rocks. Naturally, they were soaked and chilled\nthrough, but they all bore the experience with a gay philosophy.\n\nWhen we reached Big Rapids we dressed for the ball, and, as in those\ndays it was customary to change one's gown again at midnight, I had an\nopportunity to burst on the assemblage in two costumes--the second made\nof bedroom chintz, with a low neck and short sleeves. We danced the\n\"money musk,\" and the \"Virginia reel,\" \"hoeing her down\" (which means\nchanging partners) in true pioneer style. I never missed a dance at this\nor any subsequent affair, and I was considered the gayest and the most\ntireless young person at our parties until I became a Methodist minister\nand dropped such worldly vanities. The first time I preached in my home\nregion all my former partners came to hear me, and listened with wide,\nunderstanding, reminiscent smiles which made it very hard for me to keep\nsoberly to my text.\n\nIn the near future I had reason to regret the extravagant expenditure of\nmy first earnings. For my second year of teaching, in the same school, I\nwas to receive five dollars a week and to pay my own board. I selected a\nplace two miles and a half from the school-house, and was promptly asked\nby my host to pay my board in advance. This, he explained, was due to no\nlack of faith in me; the money would enable him to go \"outside\" to work,\nleaving his family well supplied with provisions. I allowed him to go\nto the school committee and collect my board in advance, at the rate of\nthree dollars a week for the season. When I presented myself at my new\nboarding-place, however, two days later, I found the house nailed up and\ndeserted; the man and his family had departed with my money, and I was\nleft, as my committeemen sympathetically remarked, \"high and dry.\" There\nwere only two dollars a week coming to me after that, so I walked back\nand forth between my home and my school, almost four miles, twice a day;\nand during this enforced exercise there was ample opportunity to reflect\non the fleeting joy of riches.\n\nIn the mean time war had been declared. When the news came that Fort\nSumter had been fired on, and that Lincoln had called for troops, our\nmen were threshing. There was only one threshing-machine in the region\nat that time, and it went from place to place, the farmers doing their\nthreshing whenever they could get the machine. I remember seeing a\nman ride up on horseback, shouting out Lincoln's demand for troops and\nexplaining that a regiment was being formed at Big Rapids. Before he had\nfinished speaking the men on the machine had leaped to the ground and\nrushed off to enlist, my brother Jack, who had recently joined us, among\nthem. In ten minutes not one man was left in the field. A few months\nlater my brother Tom enlisted as a bugler--he was a mere boy at the\ntime--and not long after that my father followed the example of his sons\nand served until the war was ended. He had entered on the twenty-ninth\nof August, 1862, as an army steward; he came back to us with the rank of\nlieutenant and assistant surgeon of field and staff.\n\nBetween those years I was the principal support of our family, and life\nbecame a strenuous and tragic affair. For months at a time we had no\nnews from the front. The work in our community, if it was done at all,\nwas done by despairing women whose hearts were with their men. When care\nhad become our constant guest, Death entered our home as well. My sister\nEleanor had married, and died in childbirth, leaving her baby to me;\nand the blackest hours of those black years were the hours that saw her\npassing. I can see her still, lying in a stupor from which she roused\nherself at intervals to ask about her child. She insisted that our\nbrother Tom should name the baby, but Tom was fighting for his country,\nunless he had already preceded Eleanor through the wide portal that was\nopening before her. I could only tell her that I had written to him; but\nbefore the assurance was an hour old she would climb up from the gulf\nof unconsciousness with infinite effort to ask if we had received his\nreply. At last, to calm her, I told her it had come, and that Tom had\nchosen for her little son the name of Arthur. She smiled at this and\ndrew a deep breath; then, still smiling, she passed away. Her baby\nslipped into her vacant place and almost filled our heavy hearts, but\nonly for a short time; for within a few months after his mother's death\nhis father married again and took him from me, and it seemed that with\nhis going we had lost all that made life worth while.\n\nThe problem of living grew harder with everyday. We eked out our little\nincome in every way we could, taking as boarders the workers in the\nlogging-camps, making quilts, which we sold, and losing no chance to\nearn a penny in any legitimate manner. Again my mother did such outside\nsewing as she could secure, yet with every month of our effort the gulf\nbetween our income and our expenses grew wider, and the price of the\nbare necessities of exisence{sic} climbed up and up. The largest amount\nI could earn at teaching was six dollars a week, and our school year\nincluded only two terms of thirteen weeks each. It was an incessant\nstruggle to keep our land, to pay our taxes, and to live. Calico was\nselling at fifty cents a yard. Coffee was one dollar a pound. There were\nno men left to grind our corn, to get in our crops, or to care for our\nlive stock; and all around us we saw our struggle reflected in the lives\nof our neighbors.\n\nAt long intervals word came to us of battles in which my father's\nregiment--the Tenth Michigan Cavalry Volunteers--or those of my brothers\nwere engaged, and then longer intervals followed in which we heard no\nnews. After Eleanor's death my brother Tom was wounded, and for months\nwe lived in terror of worse tidings, but he finally recovered. I was\nwalking seven and eight miles a day, and doing extra work before and\nafter school hours, and my health began to fail. Those were years I do\nnot like to look back upon--years in which life had degenerated into a\ntreadmill whose monotony was broken only by the grim messages from the\nfront. My sister Mary married and went to Big Rapids to live. I had no\ntime to dream my dream, but the star of my one purpose still glowed in\nmy dark horizon. It seemed that nothing short of a miracle could lift my\nfeet from their plodding way and set them on the wider path toward which\nmy eyes were turned, but I never lost faith that in some manner the\nmiracle would come to pass. As certainly as I have ever known anything,\nI KNEW that I was going to college!\n\n\n\n\nIII. HIGH-SCHOOL AND COLLEGE DAYS\n\nThe end of the Civil War brought freedom to me, too. When peace was\ndeclared my father and brothers returned to the claim in the wilderness\nwhich we women of the family had labored so desperately to hold while\nthey were gone. To us, as to others, the final years of the war had\nbrought many changes. My sister Eleanor's place was empty. Mary, as I\nhave said, had married and gone to live in Big Rapids, and my mother\nand I were alone with my brother Harry, now a boy of fourteen. After the\nreturn of our men it was no longer necessary to devote every penny of\nmy earnings to the maintenance of our home. For the first time I could\nbegin to save a portion of my income toward the fulfilment of my college\ndream, but even yet there was a long, arid stretch ahead of me before\nthe college doors came even distantly into sight.\n\nThe largest salary I could earn by teaching in our Northern woods was\none hundred and fifty-six dollars a year, for two terms of thirteen\nweeks each; and from this, of course, I had to deduct the cost of my\nboard and clothing--the sole expenditure I allowed myself. The dollars\nfor an education accumulated very, very slowly, until at last, in\ndesperation, weary of seeing the years of my youth rush past, bearing my\nhopes with them, I took a sudden and radical step. I gave up teaching,\nleft our cabin in the woods, and went to Big Rapids to live with my\nsister Mary, who had married a successful man and who generously offered\nme a home. There, I had decided, I would learn a trade of some kind, of\nany kind; it did not greatly matter what it was. The sole essential was\nthat it should be a money-making trade, offering wages which would make\nit possible to add more rapidly to my savings. In those days, almost\nfifty years ago, and in a small pioneer town, the fields open to women\nwere few and unfruitful. The needle at once presented itself, but at\nfirst I turned with loathing from it. I would have preferred the digging\nof ditches or the shoveling of coal; but the needle alone persistently\npointed out my way, and I was finally forced to take it.\n\nFate, however, as if weary at last of seeing me between her paws,\nsuddenly let me escape. Before I had been working a month at my\nuncongenial trade Big Rapids was favored by a visit from a Universalist\nwoman minister, the Reverend Marianna Thompson, who came there to\npreach. Her sermon was delivered on Sunday morning, and I was, I think,\nalmost the earliest arrival of the great congregation which filled the\nchurch. It was a wonderful moment when I saw my first woman minister\nenter her pulpit; and as I listened to her sermon, thrilled to the soul,\nall my early aspirations to become a minister myself stirred in me with\ncumulative force. After the services I hung for a time on the fringe of\nthe group that surrounded her, and at last, when she was alone and about\nto leave, I found courage to introduce myself and pour forth the tale of\nmy ambition. Her advice was as prompt as if she had studied my problem\nfor years.\n\n\"My child,\" she said, \"give up your foolish idea of learning a trade,\nand go to school. You can't do anything until you have an education. Get\nit, and get it NOW.\"\n\nHer suggestion was much to my liking, and I paid her the compliment of\nacting on it promptly, for the next morning I entered the Big Rapids\nHigh School, which was also a preparatory school for college. There I\nwould study, I determined, as long as my money held out, and with the\noptimism of youth I succeeded in confining my imagination to this side\nof that crisis. My home, thanks to Mary, was assured; the wardrobe I had\nbrought from the woods covered me sufficiently; to one who had\nwalked five and six miles a day for years, walking to school held no\ndiscomfort; and as for pleasure, I found it, like a heroine of fiction,\nin my studies. For the first time life was smiling at me, and with all\nmy young heart I smiled back.\n\nThe preceptress of the high school was Lucy Foot, a college graduate and\na remarkable woman. I had heard much of her sympathy and understanding;\nand on the evening following my first day in school I went to her\nand repeated the confidences I had reposed in the Reverend Marianna\nThompson. My trust in her was justified. She took an immediate interest\nin me, and proved it at once by putting me into the speaking and\ndebating classes, where I was given every opportunity to hold forth to\nhelpless classmates when the spirit of eloquence moved me.\n\nAs an aid to public speaking I was taught to \"elocute,\" and I remember\nin every mournful detail the occasion on which I gave my first\nrecitation. We were having our monthly \"public exhibition night,\" and\nthe audience included not only my classmates, but their parents and\nfriends as well. The selection I intended to recite was a poem entitled\n\"No Sects in Heaven,\" but when I faced my audience I was so appalled by\nits size and by the sudden realization of my own temerity that I fainted\nduring the delivery of the first verse. Sympathetic classmates carried\nme into an anteroom and revived me, after which they naturally assumed\nthat the entertainment I furnished was over for the evening. I, however,\nfelt that if I let that failure stand against me I could never afterward\nspeak in public; and within ten minutes, notwithstanding the protests of\nmy friends, I was back in the hall and beginning my recitation a second\ntime. The audience gave me its eager attention. Possibly it hoped to see\nme topple off the platform again, but nothing of the sort occurred.\nI went through the recitation with self-possession and received some\nfriendly applause at the end. Strangely enough, those first sensations\nof \"stage fright\" have been experienced, in a lesser degree, in\nconnection with each of the thousands of public speeches I have made\nsince that time. I have never again gone so far as to faint in the\npresence of an audience; but I have invariably walked out on the\nplatform feeling the sinking sensation at the pit of the stomach,\nthe weakness of the knees, that I felt in the hour of my debut. Now,\nhowever, the nervousness passes after a moment or two.\n\nFrom that night Miss Foot lost no opportunity of putting me into the\nforeground of our school affairs. I took part in all our debates,\nrecited yards of poetry to any audience we could attract, and even shone\nmildly in our amateur theatricals. It was probably owing to all this\nactivity that I attracted the interest of the presiding elder of our\ndistrict--Dr. Peck, a man of progressive ideas. There was at that time a\nmovement on foot to license women to preach in the Methodist Church, and\nDr. Peck was ambitious to be the first presiding elder to have a woman\nordained for the Methodist ministry. He had urged Miss Foot to be this\npioneer, but her ambitions did not turn in that direction. Though she\nwas a very devout Methodist, she had no wish to be the shepherd of a\nreligious flock. She loved her school-work, and asked nothing better\nthan to remain in it. Gently but persistently she directed the attention\nof Dr. Peck to me, and immediately things began to happen.\n\nWithout telling me to what it might lead, Miss Foot finally arranged\na meeting at her home by inviting Dr. Peck and me to dinner.\nBeing unconscious of any significance in the occasion, I chatted\nlight-heartedly about the large issues of life and probably settled most\nof them to my personal satisfaction. Dr. Peck drew me out and led me\non, listened and smiled. When the evening was over and we rose to go, he\nturned to me with sudden seriousness:\n\n\"My quarterly meeting will be held at Ashton,\" he remarked, casually. \"I\nwould like you to preach the quarterly sermon.\"\n\nFor a moment the earth seemed to slip away from my feet. I stared at\nhim in utter stupefaction. Then slowly I realized that, incredible as it\nseemed, the man was in earnest.\n\n\"Why,\" I stammered, \"_I_ can't preach a sermon!\"\n\nDr. Peck smiled at me. \"Have you ever tried?\" he asked.\n\nI started to assure him vehemently that I never had. Then, as if Time\nhad thrown a picture on a screen before me, I saw myself as a little\ngirl preaching alone in the forest, as I had so often preached to a\ncongregation of listening trees. I qualified my answer.\n\n\"Never,\" I said, \"to human beings.\"\n\nDr. Peck smiled again. \"Well,\" he told me, \"the door is open. Enter or\nnot, as you wish.\"\n\nHe left the house, but I remained to discuss his overwhelming\nproposition with Miss Foot. A sudden sobering thought had come to me.\n\n\"But,\" I exclaimed, \"I've never been converted. How can I preach to any\none?\"\n\nWe both had the old-time idea of conversion, which now seems so\nmistaken. We thought one had to struggle with sin and with the Lord\nuntil at last the heart opened, doubts were dispersed, and the light\npoured in. Miss Foot could only advise me to put the matter before the\nLord, to wrestle and to pray; and thereafter, for hours at a time, she\nworked and prayed with me, alternately urging, pleading, instructing,\nand sending up petitions in my behalf. Our last session was a dramatic\none, which took up the entire night. Long before it was over we were\nboth worn out; but toward morning, either from exhaustion of body or\nexaltation of soul, I seemed to see the light, and it made me very\nhappy. With all my heart I wanted to preach, and I believed that now at\nlast I had my call. The following day we sent word to Dr. Peck that I\nwould preach the sermon at Ashton as he had asked, but we urged him to\nsay nothing of the matter for the present, and Miss Foot and I also\nkept the secret locked in our breasts. I knew only too well what view\nmy family and my friends would take of such a step and of me. To them it\nwould mean nothing short of personal disgrace and a blotted page in the\nShaw record.\n\nI had six weeks in which to prepare my sermon, and I gave it most of my\nwaking hours as well as those in which I should have been asleep. I took\nfor my text: \"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even\nso must the Son of Man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in Him\nshould not perish, but have eternal life.\"\n\nIt was not until three days before I preached the sermon that I found\ncourage to confide my purpose to my sister Mary, and if I had confessed\nmy intention to commit a capital crime she could not have been more\ndisturbed. We two had always been very close, and the death of Eleanor,\nto whom we were both devoted, had drawn us even nearer to each other.\nNow Mary's tears and prayers wrung my heart and shook my resolution.\nBut, after all, she was asking me to give up my whole future, to close\nmy ears to my call, and I felt that I could not do it. My decision\ncaused an estrangement between us which lasted for years. On the day\npreceding the delivery of my sermon I left for Ashton on the afternoon\ntrain; and in the same car, but as far away from me as she could get,\nMary sat alone and wept throughout the journey. She was going to my\nmother, but she did not speak to me; and I, for my part, facing both\nalienation from her and the ordeal before me, found my one comfort in\nLucy Foot's presence and understanding sympathy.\n\nThere was no church in Ashton, so I preached my sermon in its one little\nschool-house, which was filled with a curious crowd, eager to look at\nand hear the girl who was defying all conventions by getting out of\nthe pew and into the pulpit. There was much whispering and suppressed\nexcitement before I began, but when I gave out my text silence fell upon\nthe room, and from that moment until I had finished my hearers listened\nquietly. A kerosene-lamp stood on a stand at my elbow, and as I preached\nI trembled so violently that the oil shook in its glass globe; but I\nfinished without breaking down, and at the end Dr. Peck, who had his own\nreasons for nervousness, handsomely assured me that my first sermon was\nbetter than his maiden effort had been. It was evidently not a failure,\nfor the next day he invited me to follow him around in his circuit,\nwhich included thirty-six appointments; he wished me to preach in\neach of the thirty-six places, as it was desirable to let the various\nministers hear and know me before I applied for my license as a local\npreacher.\n\nThe sermon also had another result, less gratifying. It brought out,\non the following morning, the first notice of me ever printed in a\nnewspaper. This was instigated by my brother-in-law, and it was brief\nbut pointed. It read:\n\n\nA young girl named Anna Shaw, seventeen years old, [1] preached at Ashton\nyesterday. Her real friends deprecate the course she is pursuing.\n\n[Footnote 1: A misstatement by the brother-in-law. Dr. Shaw was at\nthis time twenty-three years old.--E. J.]\n\nThe little notice had something of the effect of a lighted match applied\nto gunpowder. An explosion of public sentiment followed it, the entire\ncommunity arose in consternation, and I became a bone of contention over\nwhich friends and strangers alike wrangled until they wore themselves\nout. The members of my family, meeting in solemn council, sent for me,\nand I responded. They had a proposition to make, and they lost no time\nin putting it before me. If I gave up my preaching they would send me to\ncollege and pay for my entire course. They suggested Ann Arbor, and Ann\nArbor tempted me sorely; but to descend from the pulpit I had at last\nentered--the pulpit I had visualized in all my childish dreams--was\nnot to be considered. We had a long evening together, and it was a very\nunhappy one. At the end of it I was given twenty-four hours in which to\ndecide whether I would choose my people and college, or my pulpit and\nthe arctic loneliness of a life that held no family-circle. It did not\nrequire twenty-four hours of reflection to convince me that I must go my\nsolitary way.\n\nThat year I preached thirty-six times, at each of the presiding\nelder's appointments; and the following spring, at the annual Methodist\nConference of our district, held at Big Rapids, my name was presented to\nthe assembled ministers as that of a candidate for a license to preach.\nThere was unusual interest in the result, and my father was among\nthose who came to the Conference to see the vote taken. During these\nConferences a minister voted affirmatively on a question by holding up\nhis hand, and negatively by failing to do so. When the question of my\nlicense came up the majority of the ministers voted by raising both\nhands, and in the pleasant excitement which followed my father slipped\naway. Those who saw him told me he looked pleased; but he sent me no\nmessage showing a change of viewpoint, and the gulf between the family\nand its black sheep remained unbridged. Though the warmth of Mary's\nlove for me had become a memory, the warmth of her hearthstone was still\noffered me. I accepted it, perforce, and we lived together like shadows\nof what we had been. Two friends alone of all I had made stood by me\nwithout qualification--Miss Foot and Clara Osborn, the latter my \"chum\"\nat Big Rapids and a dweller in my heart to this day.\n\nIn the mean time my preaching had not interfered with my studies. I\nwas working day and night, but life was very difficult; for among my\nschoolmates, too, there were doubts and much head-shaking over this\nchoice of a career. I needed the sound of friendly voices, for I\nwas very lonely; and suddenly, when the pressure from all sides was\nstrongest and I was going down physically under it, a voice was raised\nthat I had never dared to dream would speak for me. Mary A. Livermore\ncame to Big Rapids, and as she was then at the height of her career, the\nentire countryside poured in to hear her. Far back in the crowded hall\nI sat alone and listened to her, thrilled by the lecture and tremulous\nwith the hope of meeting the lecturer. When she had finished speaking I\njoined the throng that surged forward from the body of the hall, and\nas I reached her and felt the grasp of her friendly hand I had a sudden\nconviction that the meeting was an epoch in my life. I was right. Some\none in the circle around us told her that I wanted to preach, and that\nI was meeting tremendous opposition. She was interested at once. She\nlooked at me with quickening sympathy, and then, suddenly putting an arm\naround me, drew me close to her side.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said, quietly, \"if you want to preach, go on and preach.\nDon't let anybody stop you. No matter what people say, don't let them\nstop you!\"\n\nFor a moment I was too overcome to answer her. These were almost my\nfirst encouraging words, and the morning stars singing together could\nnot have made sweeter music for my ears. Before I could recover a woman\nwithin hearing spoke up.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Livermore,\" she exclaimed, \"don't say that to her! We're all\ntrying to stop her. Her people are wretched over the whole thing. And\ndon't you see how ill she is? She has one foot in the grave and the\nother almost there!\"\n\nMrs. Livermore turned upon me a long and deeply thoughtful look. \"Yes,\"\nshe said at last, \"I see she has. But it is better that she should die\ndoing the thing she wants to do than that she should die because she\ncan't do it.\"\n\nHer words were a tonic which restored my voice. \"So they think I'm going\nto die!\" I cried. \"Well, I'm not! I'm going to live and preach!\"\n\nI have always felt since then that without the inspiration of Mrs.\nLivermore's encouragement I might not have continued my fight. Her\nsanction was a shield, however, from which the criticisms of the world\nfell back. Fate's more friendly interest in my affairs that year was\nshown by the fact that she sent Mrs. Livermore into my life before I had\nmet Anna Dickinson. Miss Dickinson came to us toward spring and lectured\non Joan of Arc. Never before or since have I been more deeply moved by\na speaker. When she had finished her address I made my happy way to the\nfront of the hall with the others who wished to meet the distinguished\nguest. It was our local manager who introduced me, and he said, \"This is\nour Anna Shaw. She is going to be a lecturer, too.\"\n\nI looked up at the brilliant Miss Dickinson with the trustfulness of\nyouth in my eyes. I remembered Mrs. Livermore and I thought all\ngreat women were like her, but I was now to experience a bitter\ndisillusionment. Miss Dickinson barely touched the tips of my fingers\nas she looked indifferently past the side of my face. \"Ah,\" she said,\nicily, and turned away. In later years I learned how impossible it is\nfor a public speaker to leave a gracious impression on every life that\nfor a moment touches her own; but I have never ceased to be thankful\nthat I met Mrs. Livermore before I met Miss Dickinson at the crisis in\nmy career.\n\nIn the autumn of 1873 I entered Albion College, in Albion, Michigan. I\nwas twenty-five years of age, but I looked much younger--probably not\nmore than eighteen to the casual glance. Though I had made every effort\nto save money, I had not been successful, for my expenses constantly\noutran my little income, and my position as preacher made it necessary\nfor me to have a suitable wardrobe. When the time came to enter college\nI had exactly eighteen dollars in the world, and I started for Albion\nwith this amount in my purse and without the slightest notion of how I\nwas to add to it. The money problem so pressed upon me, in fact, that\nwhen I reached my destination at midnight and discovered that it would\ncost fifty cents to ride from the station to the college, I saved that\namount by walking the entire distance on the railroad tracks, while my\nimagination busied itself pleasantly with pictures of the engine that\nmight be thundering upon me in the rear. I had chosen Albion because\nMiss Foot had been educated there, and I was encouraged by an incident\nthat happened the morning after my arrival. I was on the campus, walking\ntoward the main building, when I saw a big copper penny lying on the\nground, and, on picking it up, I discovered that it bore the year of my\nbirth. That seemed a good omen, and it was emphatically underlined by\nthe finding of two exactly similar pennies within a week. Though there\nhave been days since then when I was sorely tempted to spend them, I\nhave those three pennies still, and I confess to a certain comfort in\ntheir possession!\n\nAs I had not completed my high-school course, my first days at Albion\nwere spent in strenuous preparation for the entrance examinations; and\none morning, as I was crossing the campus with a History of the United\nStates tucked coyly under my arm, I met the president of the college,\nDr. Josclyn. He stopped for a word of greeting, during which I betrayed\nthe fact that I had never studied United States history. Dr. Josclyn at\nonce invited me into his office with, I am quite sure, the purpose of\nexplaining as kindly as he could that my preparation for college was\ninsufficient. As an opening to the subject he began to talk of history,\nand we talked and talked on, while unheeded hours were born and died.\nWe discussed the history of the United States, the governments of the\nworld, the causes which led to the influence of one nation on another,\nthe philosophical basis of the different national movements westward,\nand the like. It was the longest and by far the most interesting talk I\nhave ever had with a highly educated man, and during it I could actually\nfeel my brain expand. When I rose to go President Josclyn stopped me.\n\n\"I have something to give you,\" he said, and he wrote a few words on\na slip of paper and handed the slip to me. When, on reaching the\ndormitory, I opened it, I found that the president had passed me in the\nhistory of the entire college course! This, moreover, was not the only\npleasant result of our interview, for within a few weeks President and\nMrs. Josclyn, whose daughter had recently died, invited me to board with\nthem, and I made my home with them during my first year at Albion.\n\nMy triumph in history was followed by the swift and chastening discovery\nthat I was behind my associates in several other branches. Owing to my\nfather's early help, I was well up in mathematics, but I had much to\nlearn of philosophy and the languages, and to these I devoted many\nmidnight candles.\n\nNaturally, I soon plunged into speaking, and my first public speech at\ncollege was a defense of Xantippe. I have always felt that the poor lady\nwas greatly abused, and that Socrates deserved all he received from her,\nand more. I was glad to put myself on record as her champion, and my\nfellow-students must soon have felt that my admiration for Xantippe was\nbased on similarities of temperament, for within a few months I was\nleading the first college revolt against the authority of the men\nstudents.\n\nAlbion was a coeducational institution, and the brightest jewels in\nits crown were its three literary societies--the first composed of\nmen alone, the second of women alone, and the third of men and women\ntogether. Each of the societies made friendly advances to new students,\nand for some time I hesitated on the brink of the new joys they offered,\nuncertain which to choose. A representative of the mixed society, who\nwas putting its claims before me, unconsciously helped me to make up my\nmind.\n\n\"Women,\" he pompously assured me, \"need to be associated with men,\nbecause they don't know how to manage meetings.\"\n\nOn the instant the needle of decision swung around to the women's\nsociety and remained there, fixed.\n\n\"If they don't,\" I told the pompous young man, \"it's high time they\nlearned. I shall join the women, and we'll master the art.\"\n\nI did join the women's society, and I had not been a member very long\nbefore I discovered that when there was an advantage of any kind to be\nsecured the men invariably got it. While I was brooding somberly upon\nthis wrong an opportunity came to make a formal and effective protest\nagainst the men's high-handed methods. The Quinquennial reunion of all\nthe societies was about to be held, and the special feature of this\nfestivity was always an oration. The simple method of selecting the\norator which had formerly prevailed had been for the young men to decide\nupon the speaker and then announce his name to the women, who humbly\nconfirmed it. On this occasion, however, when the name came in to us,\nI sent a message to our brother society to the effect that we, too,\nintended to make a nomination and to send in a name.\n\nAt such unprecedented behavior the entire student body arose in\nexcitement, which, among the girls, was combined with equal parts of\nexhilaration and awe. The men refused to consider our nominee, and as a\nfriendly compromise we suggested that we have a joint meeting of all the\nsocieties and elect the speaker at this gathering; but this plan also\nthe men at first refused, giving in only after weeks of argument, during\nwhich no one had time for the calmer pleasures of study. When the joint\nmeeting was finally held, nothing was accomplished; we girls had one\nmore member than the boys had, and we promptly re-elected our candidate,\nwho was as promptly declined by the boys. Two of our girls were engaged\nto two of the boys, and it was secretly planned by our brother society\nthat during a second joint meeting these two men should take the girls\nout for a drive and then slip back to vote, leaving the girls at some\npoint sufficiently remote from college. We discovered the plot, however,\nin time to thwart it, and at last, when nothing but the unprecedented\ntie-up had been discussed for months, the boys suddenly gave up their\ncandidate and nominated me for orator.\n\nThis was not at all what I wanted, and I immediately declined to serve.\nWe girls then nominated the young man who had been first choice of our\nbrother society, but he haughtily refused to accept the compliment.\nThe reunion was only a fortnight away, and the programme had not\nbeen printed, so now the president took the situation in hand and\nperemptorily ordered me to accept the nomination or be suspended. This\nwas a wholly unexpected boomerang. I had wished to make a good fight for\nequal rights for the girls, and to impress the boys with the fact of our\nexistence as a society; but I had not desired to set the entire student\nbody by the ears nor to be forced to prepare and deliver an oration\nat the eleventh hour. Moreover, I had no suitable gown to wear on so\nimportant an occasion. One of my classmates, however, secretly wrote to\nmy sister, describing my blushing honors and explaining my need, and my\nfamily rallied to the call. My father bought the material, and my\nmother and Mary paid for the making of the gown. It was a white\nalpaca creation, trimmed with satin, and the consciousness that it\nwas extremely becoming sustained me greatly during the mental agony of\npreparing and delivering my oration. To my family that oration was the\nredeeming episode of my early career. For the moment it almost made them\nforget my crime of preaching.\n\nMy original fund of eighteen dollars was now supplemented by the\nproceeds of a series of lectures I gave on temperance. The temperance\nwomen were not yet organized, but they had their speakers, and I was\noccasionally paid five dollars to hold forth for an hour or two in the\nlittle country school-houses of our region. As a licensed preacher I\nhad no tuition fees to pay at college; but my board, in the home of the\npresident and his wife, was costing me four dollars a week, and this was\nthe limit of my expenses, as I did my own laundry-work. During my first\ncollege year the amount I paid for amusement was exactly fifty cents;\nthat went for a lecture. The mental strain of the whole experience was\nrather severe, for I never knew how much I would be able to earn; and\nI was beginning to feel the effects of this when Christmas came and\nbrought with it a gift of ninety-two dollars, which Miss Foot had\ncollected among my Big Rapids friends. That, with what I could earn,\ncarried me through the year.\n\nThe following spring our brother James, who was now living in St.\nJohnsbury, Vermont, invited my sister Mary and me to spend the summer\nwith him, and Mary and I finally dug a grave for our little hatchet and\nwent East together with something of our old-time joy in each other's\nsociety. We reached St. Johnsbury one Saturday, and within an hour of\nour arrival learned that my brother had arranged for me to preach in a\nlocal church the following day. That threatened to spoil the visit for\nMary and even to disinter the hatchet! At first she positively refused\nto go to hear me, but after a few hours of reflection she announced\ngloomily that if she did not go I would not have my hair arranged\nproperly or get my hat on straight. Moved by this conviction, she joined\nthe family parade to the church, and later, in the sacristy, she pulled\nme about and pinned me up to her heart's content. Then, reluctantly, she\nwent into the church and heard me preach. She offered no tributes after\nour return to the house, but her protests ceased from that time, and we\ngave each other the love and understanding which had marked our girlhood\ndays. The change made me very happy; for Mary was the salt of the earth,\nand next only to my longing for my mother, I had longed for her in the\nyears of our estrangement.\n\nEvery Sunday that summer I preached in or near St. Johnsbury, and toward\nautumn we had a big meeting which the ministers of all the surrounding\nchurches attended. I was asked to preach the sermon--a high\ncompliment--and I chose that important day to make a mistake in quoting\na passage from Scripture. I asked, \"Can the Ethiopian change his spots\nor the leopard his skin?\" I realized at once that I had transposed the\nwords, and no doubt a look of horror dawned in my eyes; but I went on\nwithout correcting myself and without the slightest pause. Later, one of\nthe ministers congratulated me on this presence of mind.\n\n\"If you had corrected yourself,\" he said, \"all the young people would\nhave been giggling yet over the spotted nigger. Keep to your rule of\ngoing right ahead!\"\n\nAt the end of the summer the various churches in which I had preached\ngave me a beautiful gold watch and one hundred dollars in money, and\nwith an exceedingly light heart I went back to college to begin my\nsecond year of work.\n\nFrom that time life was less complex. I had enough temperance-work and\npreaching in the country school-houses and churches to pay my college\nexpenses, and, now that my financial anxieties were relieved, my health\nsteadily improved. Several times I preached to the Indians, and these\noccasions were among the most interesting of my experiences. The squaws\ninvariably brought their babies with them, but they had a simple and\neffective method of relieving themselves of the care of the infants\nas soon as they reached the church. The papooses, who were strapped to\ntheir boards, were hung like a garment on the back wall of the building\nby a hole in the top of the board, which projected above their heads.\nEach papoose usually had a bit of fat pork tied to the end of a string\nfastened to its wrist, and with these sources of nourishment the\ninfants occupied themselves pleasantly while the sermon was in progress.\nFrequently the pork slipped down the throat of the papoose, but the\nstruggle of the child and the jerking of its hands in the strangulation\nthat followed pulled the piece safely out again. As I faced the\ncongregation I also faced the papooses, to whom the indifferent backs\nof their mothers were presented; it seemed to me there was never a time\nwhen some papoose was not choking, but no matter how much excitement or\ndiscomfort was going on among the babies, not one squaw turned her head\nto look back at them. In that assemblage the emotions were not allowed\nto interrupt the calm intellectual enjoyment of the sermon.\n\nMy most dramatic experience during this period occurred in the summer of\n1874, when I went to a Northern lumber-camp to preach in the pulpit of\na minister who was away on his honeymoon. The stage took me within\ntwenty-two miles of my destination, to a place called Seberwing. To my\ndismay, however, when I arrived at Seberwing, Saturday evening, I found\nthat the rest of the journey lay through a dense woods, and that I could\nreach my pulpit in time the next morning only by having some one drive\nme through the woods that night. It was not a pleasant prospect, for\nI had heard appalling tales of the stockades in this region and of the\nwomen who were kept prisoners there. But to miss the engagement was not\nto be thought of, and when, after I had made several vain efforts to\nfind a driver, a man appeared in a two-seated wagon and offered to take\nme to my destination, I felt that I had to go with him, though I did not\nlike his appearance. He was a huge, muscular person, with a protruding\njaw and a singularly evasive eye; but I reflected that his forbidding\nexpression might be due, in part at least, to the prospect of the long\nnight drive through the woods, to which possibly he objected as much as\nI did.\n\nIt was already growing dark when we started, and within a few moments we\nwere out of the little settlement and entering the woods. With me I\nhad a revolver I had long since learned to use, but which I very rarely\ncarried. I had hesitated to bring it now--had even left home without it;\nand then, impelled by some impulse I never afterward ceased to bless,\nhad returned for it and dropped it into my hand-bag.\n\nI sat on the back seat of the wagon, directly behind the driver, and for\na time, as we entered the darkening woods, his great shoulders blotted\nout all perspective as he drove on in stolid silence. Then, little by\nlittle, they disappeared like a rapidly fading negative. The woods were\nfilled with Norway pines, hemlocks, spruce, and tamaracks-great, somber\ntrees that must have shut out the light even on the brightest days.\nTo-night the heavens held no lamps aloft to guide us, and soon the\ndarkness folded around us like a garment. I could see neither the driver\nnor his horses. I could hear only the sibilant whisper of the trees and\nthe creak of our slow wheels in the rough forest road.\n\nSuddenly the driver began to talk, and at first I was glad to hear the\nreassuring human tones, for the experience had begun to seem like a bad\ndream. I replied readily, and at once regretted that I had done so,\nfor the man's choice of topics was most unpleasant. He began to tell me\nstories of the stockades--grim stories with horrible details, repeated\nso fully and with such gusto that I soon realized he was deliberately\naffronting my ears. I checked him and told him I could not listen to\nsuch talk.\n\nHe replied with a series of oaths and shocking vulgarities, stopping his\nhorses that he might turn and fling the words into my face. He ended\nby snarling that I must think him a fool to imagine he did not know\nthe kind of woman I was. What was I doing in that rough country, he\ndemanded, and why was I alone with him in those black woods at night?\n\nThough my heart missed a beat just then, I tried to answer him calmly.\n\n\"You know perfectly well who I am,\" I reminded him. \"And you understand\nthat I am making this journey to-night because I am to preach to-morrow\nmorning and there is no other way to keep my appointment.\"\n\nHe uttered a laugh which was a most unpleasant sound.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, coolly, \"I'm damned if I'll take you. I've got you\nhere, and I'm going to keep you here!\"\n\nI slipped my hand into the satchel in my lap, and it touched my\nrevolver. No touch of human fingers ever brought such comfort. With a\ndeep breath of thanksgiving I drew it out and cocked it, and as I did so\nhe recognized the sudden click.\n\n\"Here! What have you got there?\" he snapped.\n\n\"I have a revolver,\" I replied, as steadily as I could. \"And it is\ncocked and aimed straight at your back. Now drive on. If you stop again,\nor speak, I'll shoot you.\"\n\nFor an instant or two he blustered.\n\n\"By God,\" he cried, \"you wouldn't dare.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't I?\" I asked. \"Try me by speaking just once more.\"\n\nEven as I spoke I felt my hair rise on my scalp with the horror of the\nmoment, which seemed worse than any nightmare a woman could experience.\nBut the man was conquered by the knowledge of the waiting, willing\nweapon just behind him. He laid his whip savagely on the backs of his\nhorses and they responded with a leap that almost knocked me out of the\nwagon.\n\nThe rest of the night was a black terror I shall never forget. He did\nnot speak again, nor stop, but I dared not relax my caution for an\ninstant. Hour after hour crawled toward day, and still I sat in the\nunpierced darkness, the revolver ready. I knew he was inwardly raging,\nand that at any instant he might make a sudden jump and try to get the\nrevolver away from me. I decided that at his slightest movement I must\nshoot. But dawn came at last, and just as its bluish light touched the\ndark tips of the pines we drove up to the log hotel in the settlement\nthat was our destination. Here my driver spoke.\n\n\"Get down,\" he said, gruffly. \"This is the place.\"\n\nI sat still. Even yet I dared not trust him. Moreover, I was so stiff\nafter my vigil that I was not sure I could move.\n\n\"You get down,\" I directed, \"and wake up the landlord. Bring him out\nhere.\"\n\nHe sullenly obeyed and aroused the hotel-owner, and when the latter\nappeared I climbed out of the wagon with some effort but without\nexplanation. That morning I preached in my friend's pulpit as I had\npromised to do, and the rough building was packed to its doors with\nlumbermen who had come in from the neighboring camp. Their appearance\ncaused great surprise, as they had never attended a service before.\nThey formed a most picturesque congregation, for they all wore brilliant\nlumber-camp clothing--blue or red shirts with yellow scarfs twisted\naround their waists, and gay-colored jackets and logging-caps. There\nwere forty or fifty of them, and when we took up our collection they\nresponded with much liberality and cheerful shouts to one another.\n\n\"Put in fifty cents!\" they yelled across the church. \"Give her a\ndollar!\"\n\nThe collection was the largest that had been taken up in the history of\nthe settlement, but I soon learned that it was not the spiritual comfort\nI offered which had appealed to the lumber-men. My driver of the\nnight before, who was one of their number, had told his pals of his\nexperience, and the whole camp had poured into town to see the woman\nminister who carried a revolver.\n\n\"Her sermon?\" said one of them to my landlord, after the meeting. \"Huh!\nI dunno what she preached. But, say, don't make no mistake about one\nthing: the little preacher has sure got grit!\"\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE WOLF AT THE DOOR\n\nWhen I returned to Albion College in the autumn of 1875 I brought with\nme a problem which tormented me during my waking hours and chattered on\nmy pillow at night. Should I devote two more years of my vanishing\nyouth to the completion of my college course, or, instead, go at once\nto Boston University, enter upon my theological studies, take my degree,\nand be about my Father's business?\n\nI was now twenty-seven years old, and I had been a licensed preacher for\nthree years. My reputation in the Northwest was growing, and by sermons\nand lectures I could certainly earn enough to pay the expenses of the\nfull college course. On the other hand, Boston was a new world. There I\nwould be alone and practically penniless, and the opportunities for work\nmight be limited. Quite possibly in my final two years at Albion I could\neven save enough money to make the experience in Boston less difficult,\nand the clear common sense I had inherited from my mother reminded me\nthat in this course lay wisdom. Possibly it was some inheritance from my\nvisionary father which made me, at the end of three months, waive these\nsage reflections, pack my few possessions, and start for Boston, where I\nentered the theological school of the university in February, 1876.\n\nIt was an instance of stepping off a solid plank and into space; and\nthough there is exhilaration in the sensation, as I discovered then and\nat later crises in life when I did the same thing, there was also an\namount of subsequent discomfort for which even my lively imagination\nhad not prepared me. I went through some grim months in Boston--months\nduring which I learned what it was to go to bed cold and hungry, to\nwake up cold and hungry, and to have no knowledge of how long these\nconditions might continue. But not more than once or twice during the\nstruggle there, and then only for an hour or two in the physical and\nmental depression attending malnutrition, did I regret coming. At that\nperiod of my life I believed that the Lord had my small personal affairs\nvery much on His mind. If I starved and froze it was His test of my\nworthiness for the ministry, and if He had really chosen me for one of\nHis servants, He would see me through. The faith that sustained me\nthen has still a place in my life, and existence without it would be an\ninfinitely more dreary affair than it is. But I admit that I now call\nupon the Lord less often and less imperatively than I did before the\nstern years taught me my unimportance in the great scheme of things.\n\nMy class at the theological school was composed of forty-two young men\nand my unworthy self, and before I had been a member of it an hour I\nrealized that women theologians paid heavily for the privilege of being\nwomen. The young men of my class who were licensed preachers were given\nfree accommodations in the dormitory, and their board, at a club formed\nfor their assistance, cost each of them only one dollar and twenty-five\ncents a week. For me no such kindly provision was made. I was not\nallowed a place in the dormitory, but instead was given two dollars a\nweek to pay the rent of a room outside. Neither was I admitted to the\neconomical comforts of the club, but fed myself according to my income,\na plan which worked admirably when there was an income, but left an\nobvious void when there was not.\n\nWith characteristic optimism, however, I hired a little attic room on\nTremont Street and established myself therein. In lieu of a window\nthe room offered a pale skylight to the February storms, and there\nwas neither heat in it nor running water; but its possession gave me a\npleasant sense of proprietorship, and the whole experience seemed a high\nadventure. I at once sought opportunities to preach and lecture, but\nthese were even rarer than firelight and food. In Albion I had been\npractically the only licensed preacher available for substitute and\nspecial work. In Boston University's three theological classes there\nwere a hundred men, each snatching eagerly at the slightest possibility\nof employment; and when, despite this competition, I received and\nresponded to an invitation to preach, I never knew whether I was to be\npaid for my services in cash or in compliments. If, by a happy chance,\nthe compensation came in cash, the amount was rarely more than five\ndollars, and never more than ten. There was no help in sight from my\nfamily, whose early opposition to my career as a minister had hotly\nflamed forth again when I started East. I lived, therefore, on milk and\ncrackers, and for weeks at a time my hunger was never wholly satisfied.\nIn my home in the wilderness I had often heard the wolves prowling\naround our door at night. Now, in Boston, I heard them even at high\nnoon.\n\nThere is a special and almost indescribable depression attending such\nconditions. No one who has not experienced the combination of continued\ncold, hunger, and loneliness in a great, strange, indifferent city can\nrealize how it undermines the victim's nerves and even tears at the\nmoral fiber. The self-humiliation I experienced was also intense. I had\nworked my way in the Northwest; why could I not work my way in Boston?\nWas there, perhaps, some lack in me and in my courage? Again and again\nthese questions rose in my mind and poisoned my self-confidence. The\none comfort I had in those black days was the knowledge that no\none suspected the depth of the abyss in which I dwelt. We were\nall struggling; to the indifferent glance--and all glances were\nindifferent--my struggle was no worse than that of my classmates whose\nrooms and frugal meals were given them.\n\nAfter a few months of this existence I was almost ready to believe that\nthe Lord's work for me lay outside of the ministry, and while this fear\nwas gripping me a serious crisis came in my financial affairs. The day\ndawned when I had not a cent, nor any prospect of earning one. My stock\nof provisions consisted of a box of biscuit, and my courage was flowing\nfrom me like blood from an opened vein. Then came one of the quick turns\nof the wheel of chance which make for optimism. Late in the afternoon\nI was asked to do a week of revival work with a minister in a local\nchurch, and when I accepted his invitation I mentally resolved to let\nthat week decide my fate. My shoes had burst open at the sides; for lack\nof car-fare I had to walk to and from the scene of my meetings, though I\nhad barely strength for the effort. If my week of work brought me enough\nto buy a pair of cheap shoes and feed me for a few days I would, I\ndecided, continue my theological course. If it did not, I would give up\nthe fight.\n\nNever have I worked harder or better than during those seven days, when\nI put into the effort not only my heart and soul, but the last flame of\nmy dying vitality, We had a rousing revival--one of the good old-time\naffairs when the mourners' benches were constantly filled and the air\nresounded with alleluias. The excitement and our success, mildly aided\nby the box of biscuit, sustained me through the week, and not until\nthe last night did I realize how much of me had gone into this final\ndesperate charge of mine. Then, the service over and the people\ndeparted, I sank, weak and trembling, into a chair, trying to pull\nmyself together before hearing my fate in the good-night words of the\nminister I had assisted. When he came to me and began to compliment me\non the work I had done, I could not rise. I sat still and listened with\ndowncast eyes, afraid to lift them lest he read in them something of my\nneed and panic in this moment when my whole future seemed at stake.\n\nAt first his words rolled around the empty church as if they were\ntrying to get away from me, but at last I began to catch them. I was, it\nseemed, a most desirable helper. It had been a privilege and a pleasure\nto be associated with me. Beyond doubt, I would go far in my career.\nHe heartily wished that he could reward me adequately. I deserved fifty\ndollars.\n\nMy tired heart fluttered at this. Probably my empty stomach fluttered,\ntoo; but in the next moment something seemed to catch my throat and stop\nmy breath. For it appeared that, notwithstanding the enthusiasm and\nthe spiritual uplift of the week, the collections had been very\ndisappointing and the expenses unusually heavy. He could not give me\nfifty dollars. He could not give me anything at all. He thanked me\nwarmly and wished me good night.\n\nI managed to answer him and to get to my feet, but that journey down the\naisle from my chair to the church door was the longest journey I have\never made. During it I felt not only the heart-sick disappointment of\nthe moment, but the cumulative unhappiness of the years to come. I was\nfriendless, penniless, and starving, but it was not of these conditions\nthat I thought then. The one overwhelming fact was that I had been\nweighed and found wanting. I was not worthy.\n\nI stumbled along, passing blindly a woman who stood on the street near\nthe church entrance. She stopped me, timidly, and held out her hand.\nThen suddenly she put her arms around me and wept. She was an old lady,\nand I did not know her, but it seemed fitting that she should cry just\nthen, as it would have seemed fitting to me if at that black moment all\nthe people on the earth had broken into sudden wailing.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Shaw,\" she said, \"I'm the happiest woman in the world, and I\nowe my happiness to you. To-night you have converted my grandson. He's\nall I have left, but he has been a wild boy, and I've prayed over him\nfor years. Hereafter he is going to lead a different life. He has just\ngiven me his promise on his knees.\"\n\nHer hand fumbled in her purse.\n\n\"I am a poor woman,\" she went on, \"but I have enough, and I want to make\nyou a little present. I know how hard life is for you young students.\"\n\nShe pressed a bill into my fingers. \"It's very little,\" she said,\nhumbly; \"it is only five dollars.\"\n\nI laughed, and in that exultant moment I seemed to hear life laughing\nwith me. With the passing of the bill from her hand to mine existence\nhad become a new experience, wonderful and beautiful.\n\n\"It's the biggest gift I have ever had,\" I told her. \"This little bill\nis big enough to carry my future on its back!\"\n\nI had a good meal that night, and I bought the shoes the next morning.\nInfinitely more sustaining than the food, however, was the conviction\nthat the Lord was with me and had given me a sign of His approval. The\nexperience was the turning-point of my theological career. When the\nmoney was gone I succeeded in obtaining more work from time to time--and\nthough the grind was still cruelly hard, I never again lost hope. The\ntheological school was on Bromfield Street, and we students climbed\nthree flights of stairs to reach our class-rooms. Through lack of proper\nfood I had become too weak to ascend these stairs without sitting down\nonce or twice to rest, and within a month after my experience with the\nappreciative grandmother I was discovered during one of these resting\nperiods by Mrs. Barrett, the superintendent of the Woman's Foreign\nMissionary Society, which had offices in our building. She stopped,\nlooked me over, and then invited me into her room, where she asked me\nif I felt ill. I assured her that I did not. She asked a great many\nadditional questions and, little by little, under the womanly sympathy\nof them, my reserve broke down and she finally got at the truth, which\nuntil that hour I had succeeded in concealing. She let me leave without\nmuch comment, but the next day she again invited me into her office and\ncame directly to the purpose of the interview.\n\n\"Miss Shaw,\" she said, \"I have been talking to a friend of mine about\nyou, and she would like to make a bargain with you. She thinks you are\nworking too hard. She will pay you three dollars and a half a week\nfor the rest of this school year if you will promise to give up your\npreaching. She wants you to rest, study, and take care of your health.\"\n\nI asked the name of my unknown friend, but Mrs. Barrett said that was to\nremain a secret. She had been given a check for seventy-eight dollars,\nand from this, she explained, my allowance would be paid in weekly\ninstalments. I took the money very gratefully, and a few years later I\nreturned the amount to the Missionary Society; but I never learned the\nidentity of my benefactor. Her three dollars and a half a week, added to\nthe weekly two dollars I was allowed for room rent, at once solved the\nproblem of living; and now that meal-hours had a meaning in my life, my\nhealth improved and my horizon brightened. I spent most of my evenings\nin study, and my Sundays in the churches of Phillips Brooks and James\nFreeman Clark, my favorite ministers. Also, I joined the university's\npraying-band of students, and took part in the missionary-work among the\nwomen of the streets. I had never forgotten my early friend in Lawrence,\nthe beautiful \"mysterious lady\" who had loved me as a child, and, in\nmemory of her, I set earnestly about the effort to help unfortunates of\nher class. I went into the homes of these women, followed them to the\nstreets and the dance-halls, talked to them, prayed with them, and\nmade friends among them. Some of them I was able to help, but many were\nbeyond help; and I soon learned that the effective work in that field is\nthe work which is done for women before, not after, they have fallen.\n\nDuring my vacation in the summer of 1876 I went to Cape Cod and earned\nmy expenses by substituting in local pulpits. Here, at East Dennis, I\nformed the friendship which brought me at once the greatest happiness\nand the deepest sorrow of that period of my life. My new friend was\na widow whose name was Persis Addy, and she was also the daughter of\nCaptain Prince Crowell, then the most prominent man in the Cape Cod\ncommunity--a bank president, a railroad director, and a citizen of\nwealth, as wealth was rated in those days. When I returned to the\ntheological school in the autumn Mrs. Addy came to Boston with me, and\nfrom that time until her death, two years later, we lived together. She\nwas immensely interested in my work, and the friendly part she took in\nit diverted her mind from the bereavement over which she had brooded for\nyears, while to me her coming opened windows into a new world. I was\nno longer lonely; and though in my life with her I paid my way to\nthe extent of my small income, she gave me my first experience of\nan existence in which comfort and culture, recreation, and leisurely\nreading were cheerful commonplaces. For the first time I had some one\nto come home to, some one to confide in, some one to talk to, listen\nto, and love. We read together and went to concerts together; and it was\nduring this winter that I attended my first theatrical performance. The\nstar was Mary Anderson, in \"Pygmalion and Galatea,\" and play and player\ncharmed me so utterly that I saw them every night that week, sitting\nhigh in the gallery and enjoying to the utmost the unfolding of this new\ndelight. It was so glowing a pleasure that I longed to make some return\nto the giver of it; but not until many years afterward, when I met\nMadame Navarro in London, was I able to tell her what the experience had\nbeen and to thank her for it.\n\nI did not long enjoy the glimpses into my new world, for soon, and\nmost tragically, it was closed to me. In the spring following our first\nBoston winter together Mrs. Addy and I went to Hingham, Massachusetts,\nwhere I had been appointed temporary pastor of the Methodist Church.\nThere Mrs. Addy was taken ill, and as she grew steadily worse we\nreturned to Boston to live near the best available physicians, who for\nmonths theorized over her malady without being able to diagnose it. At\nlast her father, Captain Crowell, sent to Paris for Dr. Brown-Sequard,\nthen the most distinguished specialist of his day, and Dr.\nBrown-Sequard, when he arrived and examined his patient, discovered that\nshe had a tumor on the brain. She had had a great shock in her life--the\ntragic death of her husband at sea during their wedding tour around\nthe world--and it was believed that her disease dated from that time.\nNothing could be done for her, and she failed daily during our second\nyear together, and died in March, 1878, just before I finished my\ntheological course and while I was still temporary pastor of the church\nat Hingham. Every moment I could take from my parish and my studies I\nspent with her, and those were sorrowful months. In her poor, tortured\nbrain the idea formed that I, not she, was the sick person in our family\nof two, and when we were at home together she insisted that I must lie\ndown and let her nurse me; then for hours she brooded over me, trying to\nrelieve the agony she believed I was experiencing. When at last she was\nat peace her father and I took her home to Cape Cod and laid her in the\ngraveyard of the little church where we had met at the beginning of our\nbrief and beautiful friendship; and the subsequent loneliness I felt\nwas far greater than any I had ever suffered in the past, for now I had\nlearned the meaning of companionship.\n\nThree months after Mrs. Addy's death I graduated. She had planned\nto take me abroad, and during our first winter together we had spent\ncountless hours talking and dreaming of our European wanderings. When\nshe found that she must die she made her will and left me fifteen\nhundred dollars for the visit to Europe, insisting that I must carry out\nthe plan we had made; and during her conscious periods she constantly\ntalked of this and made me promise that I would go. After her death it\nseemed to me that to go without her was impossible. Everything of beauty\nI looked upon would hold memories of her, keeping fresh my sorrow and\nemphasizing my loneliness; but it was her last expressed desire that I\nshould go, and I went.\n\nFirst, however, I had graduated--clad in a brandnew black silk gown, and\nwith five dollars in my pocket, which I kept there during the graduation\nexercises. I felt a special satisfaction in the possession of that\nmoney, for, notwithstanding the handicap of being a woman, I was said to\nbe the only member of my class who had worked during the entire course,\ngraduated free from debt, and had a new outfit as well as a few dollars\nin cash.\n\nI graduated without any special honors. Possibly I might have won\nsome if I had made the effort, but my graduation year, as I have just\nexplained, had been very difficult. As it was, I was merely a good\naverage student, feeling my isolation as the only woman in my class,\nbut certainly not spurring on my men associates by the display of any\nbrilliant gifts. Naturally, I missed a great deal of class fellowship\nand class support, and throughout my entire course I rarely entered my\nclass-room without the abysmal conviction that I was not really wanted\nthere. But some of the men were goodhumoredly cordial, and several of\nthem are among my friends to-day. Between myself and my family there\nstill existed the breach I had created when I began to preach. With the\nexception of Mary and James, my people openly regarded me, during my\ntheological course, as a dweller in outer darkness, and even my mother's\nlove was clouded by what she felt to be my deliberate and persistent\nflouting of her wishes.\n\nToward the end of my university experience, however, an incident\noccurred which apparently changed my mother's viewpoint. She was\nnow living with my sister Mary, in Big Rapids, Michigan, and, on the\noccasion of one of my rare and brief visits to them I was invited to\npreach in the local church. Here, for the first time, my mother heard\nme. Dutifully escorted by one of my brothers, she attended church that\nmorning in a state of shivering nervousness. I do not know what she\nexpected me to do or say, but toward the end of the sermon it\nbecame clear that I had not justified her fears. The look of intense\napprehension left her eyes, her features relaxed into placidity, and\nlater in the day she paid me the highest compliment I had yet received\nfrom a member of my family.\n\n\"I liked the sermon very much,\" she peacefully told my brother. \"Anna\ndidn't say anything about hell, or about anything else!\"\n\nWhen we laughed at this handsome tribute, she hastened to qualify it.\n\n\"What I mean,\" she explained, \"is that Anna didn't say anything\nobjectionable in the pulpit!\" And with this recognition I was content.\n\nBetween the death of my friend and my departure for Europe I buried\nmyself in the work of the university and of my little church; and as if\nin answer to the call of my need, Mary E. Livermore, who had given me\nthe first professional encouragement I had ever received, re-entered my\nlife. Her husband, like myself, was pastor of a church in Hingham, and\nwhenever his finances grew low, or there was need of a fund for some\nspecial purpose--conditions that usually exist in a small church--his\nbrilliant wife came to his assistance and raised the money, while her\nhusband retired modestly to the background and regarded her with adoring\neyes. On one of these occasions, I remember, when she entered the pulpit\nto preach her sermon, she dropped her bonnet and coat on an unoccupied\nchair. A little later there was need of this chair, and Mr. Livermore,\nwho sat under the pulpit, leaned forward, picked up the garments, and,\nwithout the least trace of selfconsciousness, held them in his lap\nthroughout the sermon. One of the members of the church, who appeared\nto be irritated by the incident, later spoke of it to him and added,\nsardonically, \"How does it feel to be merely 'Mrs. Livermore's\nhusband'?\"\n\nIn reply Mr. Livermore flashed on him one of his charming smiles. \"Why,\nI'm very proud of it,\" he said, with the utmost cheerfulness. \"You see,\nI'm the only man in the world who has that distinction.\"\n\nThey were a charming couple, the Livermores, and they deserved far more\nthan they received from a world to which they gave so freely and so\nrichly. To me, as to others, they were more than kind; and I never\nrecall them without a deep feeling of gratitude and an equally deep\nsense of loss in their passing.\n\nIt was during this period, also, that I met Frances E. Willard. There\nwas a great Moody revival in progress in Boston, and Miss Willard was\nthe righthand assistant of Mr. Moody. To her that revival must have been\nmarked with a star, for during it she met for the first time Miss Anna\nGordon, who became her life-long friend and her biographer. The meetings\nalso laid the foundation of our friendship, and for many years Miss\nWillard and I were closely associated in work and affection.\n\nOn the second or third night of the revival, during one of the \"mixed\nmeetings,\" attended by both women and men, Mr. Moody invited those who\nwere willing to talk to sinners to come to the front. I went down the\naisle with others, and found a seat near Miss Willard, to whom I was\nthen introduced by some one who knew us both. I wore my hair short in\nthose days, and I had a little fur cap on my head. Though I had been\npreaching for several years, I looked absurdly young--far too young, it\nsoon became evident, to interest Mr. Moody. He was already moving about\namong the men and women who had responded to his invitation, and one by\none he invited them to speak, passing me each time until at last I\nwas left alone. Then he took pity on me and came to my side to whisper\nkindly that I had misunderstood his invitation. He did not want young\ngirls to talk to his people, he said, but mature women with worldly\nexperience. He advised me to go home to my mother, adding, to soften the\nblow, that some time in the future when there were young girls at the\nmeeting I could come and talk to them.\n\nI made no explanations to him, but started to leave, and Miss Willard,\nwho saw me departing, followed and stopped me. She asked why I was\ngoing, and I told her that Mr. Moody had sent me home to grow.\nFrances Willard had a keen sense of humor, and she enjoyed the joke so\nthoroughly that she finally convinced me it was amusing, though at\nfirst the humor of it had escaped me. She took me back to Mr. Moody and\nexplained the situation to him, and he apologized and put me to work.\nHe said he had thought I was about sixteen. After that I occasionally\nhelped him in the intervals of my other work.\n\nThe time had come to follow Mrs. Addy's wishes and go to Europe, and I\nsailed in the month of June following my graduation, and traveled\nfor three months with a party of tourists under the direction of Eben\nTourgee, of the Boston Conservatory of Music. We landed in Glasgow, and\nfrom there went to England, Belgium, Holland, Germany, France, and\nlast of all to Italy. Our company included many clergymen and a\nnever-to-be-forgotten widow whose light-hearted attitude toward the\nmemory of her departed spouse furnished the comedy of our first voyage.\nIt became a pet diversion to ask her if her husband still lived, for she\nalways answered the question in the same mournful words, and with the\nsame manner of irrepressible gaiety.\n\n\"Oh no!\" she would chirp. \"My dear departed has been in our Heavenly\nFather's house for the past eight years!\"\n\nAt its best, the vacation without my friend was tragically incomplete,\nand only a few of its incidents stand out with clearness across the\nforty-six years that have passed since then. One morning, I remember, I\npreached an impromptu sermon in the Castle of Heidelberg before a large\ngathering; and a little later, in Genoa, I preached a very different\nsermon to a wholly different congregation. There was a gospel-ship in\nthe harbor, and one Saturday the pastor of it came ashore to ask if\nsome American clergyman in our party would preach on his ship the next\nmorning. He was an old-time, orthodox Presbyterian, and from the tips\nof his broad-soled shoes to the severe part in the hair above his\nsanctimonious brow he looked the type. I was not present when he called\nat our hotel, and my absence gave my fellow-clergymen an opportunity to\nplay a joke on the gentleman from the gospel-ship. They assured him that\n\"Dr. Shaw\" would preach for him, and the pastor returned to his post\ngreatly pleased. When they told me of his invitation, however, they did\nnot add that they had neglected to tell him Dr. Shaw was a woman, and I\nwas greatly elated by the compliment I thought had been paid me.\n\nOur entire party of thirty went out to the gospelship the next morning,\nand when the pastor came to meet us, lank and forbidding, his austere\nlips vainly trying to curve into a smile of welcome, they introduced me\nto him as the minister who was to deliver the sermon. He had just taken\nmy hand; he dropped it as if it had burned his own. For a moment he had\nno words to meet the crisis. Then he stuttered something to the effect\nthat the situation was impossible that his men would not listen to a\nwoman, that they would mob her, that it would be blasphemous for a woman\nto preach. My associates, who had so light-heartedly let me in for this\nunpleasant experience, now realized that they must see me through it.\nThey persuaded him to allow me to preach the sermon.\n\nWith deep reluctance the pastor finally accepted me and the situation;\nbut when the moment came to introduce me, he devoted most of his time to\nheartfelt apologies for my presence. He explained to the sailors that\nI was a woman, and fervidly assured them that he himself was not\nresponsible for my appearance there. With every word he uttered he put a\nbrick in the wall he was building between me and the crew, until at last\nI felt that I could never get past it. I was very unhappy, very lonely,\nvery homesick; and suddenly the thought came to me that these men,\nnotwithstanding their sullen eyes and forbidding faces, might be lonely\nand homesick, too. I decided to talk to them as a woman and not as a\nminister, and I came down from the pulpit and faced them on their own\nlevel, looking them over and mentally selecting the hardest specimens of\nthe lot as the special objects of my appeal. One old fellow, who\nlooked like a pirate with his red-rimmed eyes, weather-beaten skin,\nand fimbriated face, grinned up at me in such sardonic challenge that I\nwalked directly in front of him and began to speak. I said:\n\n\"My friends, I hope you will forget everything Dr. Blank has just said.\nIt is true that I am a minister, and that I came here to preach. But now\nI do not intend to preach--only to have a friendly talk, on a text which\nis not in the Bible. I am very far from home, and I feel as homesick as\nsome of you men look. So my text is, 'Blessed are the homesick, for they\nshall go home.'\"\n\nIn my summers at Cape Cod I had learned something about sailors. I knew\nthat in the inprepossessing congregation before me there were many boys\nwho had run away from home, and men who had left home because of family\ntroubles. I talked to the young men first, to those who had forgotten\ntheir mothers and thought their mothers had forgotten them, and I told\nof my experiences with waiting, heavy-hearted mothers who had sons at\nsea. Some heads went down at that, and here and there I saw a boy gulp,\nbut the old fellow I was particularly anxious to move still grinned up\nat me like a malicious monkey. Then I talked of the sailor's wife, and\nof her double burden of homemaking and anxiety, and soon I could pick\nout some of the husbands by their softened faces. But still my old\nman grinned and squinted. Last of all I described the whalers who were\nabsent from home for years, and who came back to find their children and\ntheir grandchildren waiting for them. I told how I had seen them, in our\nNew England coast towns, covered, as a ship is covered with barnacles,\nby grandchildren who rode on their shoulders and sat astride of their\nnecks as they walked down the village streets. And now at last the sneer\nleft my old man's loose lips. He had grandchildren somewhere. He\ntwisted uneasily in his seat, coughed, and finally took out a big red\nhandkerchief and wiped his eyes. The episode encouraged me.\n\n\"When I came here,\" I added, \"I intended to preach a sermon on 'The\nHeavenly Vision.' Now I want to give you a glimpse of that in addition\nto the vision we have had of home.\"\n\nI ended with a bit of the sermon and a prayer, and when I raised my head\nthe old man of the sardonic grin was standing before me.\n\n\"Missus,\" he said in a husky whisper, \"I'd like to shake your hand.\"\n\nI took his hard old fist, and then, seeing that many of the other\nsailors were beginning to move hospitably but shyly toward me, I said:\n\n\"I would like to shake hands with every man here.\"\n\nAt the words they surged forward, and the affair became a reception,\nduring which I shook hands with every sailor of my congregation. The\nnext day my hand was swollen out of shape, for the sailors had gripped\nit as if they were hauling on a hawser; but the experience was worth\nthe discomfort. The best moment of the morning came, however, when the\npastor of the ship faced me, goggle-eyed and marveling.\n\n\"I wouldn't have believed it,\" was all he could say. \"I thought the men\nwould mob you.\"\n\n\"Why should they mob me?\" I wanted to know.\n\n\"Why,\" he stammered, \"because the thing is so--so--unnatural.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"if it is unnatural for women to talk to men, we have\nbeen living in an unnatural world for a long time. Moreover, if it is\nunnatural, why did Jesus send a woman out as the first preacher?\"\n\nHe waived a discussion of that question by inviting us all to his cabin\nto drink wine with him--and as we were \"total abstainers,\" it seemed\nas unnatural to us to have him offer us wine as a woman's preaching had\nseemed to him.\n\nThe next European incident on which memory throws a high-light was\nour audience with Pope Leo XIII. As there were several distinguished\nAmericans in our party, a private audience was arranged for us, and for\ndays before the time appointed we nervously rehearsed the etiquette of\nthe occasion. When we reached the Vatican we were marched between rows\nof Swiss Guards to the Throne Room, only to learn there that we were\nto be received in the Tapestry Room. Here we found a very impressive\nassemblage of cardinals and Vatican officials, and while we were still\nlost in the beauty of the picture they made against the room's\nsuperb background, the approach of the Pope was announced. Every\none immediately knelt, except a few persons who tried to show their\ndemocracy by standing; but I am sure that even these individuals felt a\nthrill when the slight, exquisite figure appeared at the door and gave\nus a general benediction. Then the Pope passed slowly down the line,\noffering his hand to each of us, and radiating a charm so gracious\nand so human that few failed to respond to the appeal of his engaging\npersonality. There was nothing fleshly about Leo XIII. His body was so\nfrail, so wraithlike, that one almost expected to see through it the\nmagnificent tapestries on the walls. But from the moment he appeared\nevery eye clung to him, every thought was concentrated upon him. This\neffect I think he would have produced even if he had come among us\nunrecognized, for through the thin shell that housed it shone the steady\nflame of a wonderful spirit.\n\nI had previously remarked to my friends that kissing the Pope's\nring after so many other lips had touched it did not appeal to me\nas hygienic, and that I intended to kiss his hand instead. When my\nopportunity came I kept my word; but after I had kissed the venerable\nhand I remained kneeling for an instant with bowed head, a little aghast\nat my daring. The gentle Father thought, however, that I was waiting\nfor a special blessing. He gave it to me gravely and passed on, and I\ndevoted the next few hours to ungodly crowing over the associates who\nhad received no such individual attention.\n\nIn Venice we attended the great fete celebrating the first visit of\nKing Humbert and Queen Margherita. It was also the first time Venice had\nentertained a queen since the Italian union, and the sea-queen of\nthe Adriatic outdid herself in the gorgeousness and the beauty of her\npreparations. The Grand Canal was like a flowing rainbow, reflecting\nthe brilliant decorations on every side, and at night the moonlight, the\nmusic, the chiming church-bells, the colored lanterns, the gay voices,\nthe lapping waters against the sides of countless gondolas made the\nexperience seem like a dream of a new and unbelievably beautiful world.\nForty thousand persons were gathered in the Square of St. Mark and\nin front of the Palace, and I recall a pretty incident in which the\ngracious Queen and a little street urchin figured. The small, ragged\nboy had crept as close to the royal balcony as he dared, and then,\nunobserved, had climbed up one of its pillars. At the moment when a\nsudden hush had fallen on the crowd this infant, overcome by patriotism\nand a glimpse of the royal lady on the balcony above him, suddenly piped\nup shrilly in the silence. \"Long live the Queen!\" he cried. \"Long live\nthe Queen!\"\n\nThe gracious Margherita heard the childish voice, and, amused and\ninterested, leaned over the balcony to see where it came from. What she\nsaw doubtless touched the mother-heart in her. She caught the eye of\nthe tattered urchin clinging to the pillar, and radiantly smiled on him.\nThen, probably thinking that the King was absorbing the attention of\nthe great assemblage, she indulged in a little diversion. Leaning\nfar forward, she kissed the tip of her lace handkerchief and swept\nit caressingly across the boy's brown cheek, smiling down at him as\nunconsciously as if she and the enraptured youngster were alone together\nin the world. The next instant she had straightened up and flushed, for\nthe watchful crowd had seen the episode and was wild with enthusiasm.\nFor ten minutes the people cheered the Queen without ceasing, and for\nthe next few days they talked of little but the spontaneous, girlish\naction which had delighted them all.\n\nOne more sentimental record, and I shall have reached another\nmile-stone. As I have said, my friend Mrs. Addy left me in her will\nfifteen hundred dollars for my visit to Europe, and before I sailed\nher father, who was one of the best friends I have ever had, made a\ncharacteristically kind proposition in connection with the little fund.\nInstead of giving me the money, he gave me two railroad bonds, one\nfor one thousand dollars, the other for five hundred dollars, and each\ndrawing seven per cent. interest. He suggested that I deposit these\nbonds in the bank of which he was president, and borrow from the bank\nthe money to go abroad. Then, when I returned and went into my new\nparish, I could use some of my salary every month toward repaying the\nloan. These monthly payments, he explained, could be as small as I\nwished, but each month the interest on the amount I paid would cease.\nI gladly took his advice and borrowed seven hundred dollars. After\nI returned from Europe I repaid the loan in monthly instalments, and\neventually got my bonds, which I still own. They will mature in 1916.\nI have had one hundred and five dollars a year from them, in interest,\never since I received them in 1878--more than twice as much interest\nas their face value--and every time I have gone abroad I have used this\ninterest toward paying my passage. Thus my friend has had a share in\neach of the many visits I have made to Europe, and in all of them her\nmemory has been vividly with me.\n\nWith my return from Europe my real career as a minister began. The year\nin the pulpit at Hingham had been merely tentative, and though I had\nsucceeded in building up the church membership to four times what it had\nbeen when I took charge, I was not reappointed. I had paid off a small\nchurch debt, and had had the building repaired, painted, and carpeted.\nNow that it was out of its difficulties it offered some advantages to\nthe occupant of its pulpit, and of these my successor, a man, received\nthe benefit. I, however, had small ground for complaint, for I was at\nonce offered and accepted the pastorate of a church at East Dennis, Cape\nCod. Here I went in October, 1878, and here I spent seven of the most\ninteresting years of my life.\n\n\n\n\nV. SHEPHERD OF A DIVIDED FLOCK\n\nOn my return from Europe, as I have said, I took up immediately and most\nbuoyantly the work of my new parish. My previous occupation of various\npulpits, whether long or short, had always been in the role of a\nsubstitute. Now, for the first time, I had a church of my own, and was\nto stand or fall by the record made in it. The ink was barely dry on\nmy diploma from the Boston Theological School, and, as it happened,\nthe little church to which I was called was in the hands of two warring\nfactions, whose battles furnished the most fervid interest of the Cape\nCod community. But my inexperience disturbed me not at all, and I was\nblissfully ignorant of the division in the congregation. So I entered my\nnew field as trustfully as a child enters a garden; and though I was\nin trouble from the beginning, and resigned three times in startling\nsuccession, I ended by remaining seven years.\n\nMy appointment did not cause even a lull in the warfare among my\nparishioners. Before I had crossed the threshold of my church I was\nmade to realize that I was shepherd of a divided flock. Exactly what\nhad caused the original breach I never learned; but it had widened with\ntime, until it seemed that no peacemaker could build a bridge large\nenough to span it. As soon as I arrived in East Dennis each faction\ntried to pour into my ears its bitter criticisms of the other, but I\nmade and consistently followed the safe rule of refusing to listen to\neither side, I announced publicly that I would hear no verbal charges\nwhatever, but that if my two flocks would state their troubles in\nwriting I would call a board meeting to discuss and pass upon them. This\nthey both resolutely refused to do (it was apparently the first time\nthey had ever agreed on any point); and as I steadily declined to listen\nto complaints, they devised an original method of putting them before\nme.\n\nDuring the regular Thursday-night prayer-meeting, held about two weeks\nafter my arrival, and at which, of course, I presided, they voiced their\ndifficulties in public prayer, loudly and urgently calling upon the Lord\nto pardon such and such a liar, mentioning the gentleman by name, and\nsuch and such a slanderer, whose name was also submitted. By the time\nthe prayers were ended there were few untarnished reputations in the\ncongregation, and I knew, perforce, what both sides had to say.\n\nThe following Thursday night they did the same thing, filling their\nprayers with intimate and surprising details of one another's history,\nand I endured the situation solely because I did not know how to meet\nit. I was still young, and my theological course had set no guide-posts\non roads as new as these. To interfere with souls in their communion\nwith God seemed impossible; to let them continue to utter personal\nattacks in church, under cover of prayer, was equally impossible. Any\ncourse I could follow seemed to lead away from my new parish, yet both\nduty and pride made prompt action necessary. By the time we gathered\nfor the third prayermeeting I had decided what to do, and before the\nservices began I rose and addressed my erring children. I explained that\nthe character of the prayers at our recent meetings was making us the\nlaughingstock of the community, that unbelievers were ridiculing our\nreligion, and that the discipline of the church was being wrecked; and I\nended with these words, each of which I had carefully weighed:\n\n\"Now one of two things must happen. Either you will stop this kind\nof praying, or you will remain away from our meetings. We will hold\nprayermeetings on another night, and I shall refuse admission to any\namong you who bring personal criticisms into your public prayers.\"\n\nAs I had expected it to do, the announcement created an immediate\nuproar. Both factions sprang to their feet, trying to talk at once. The\nstorm raged until I dismissed the congregation, telling the members that\ntheir conduct was an insult to the Lord, and that I would not listen to\neither their protests or their prayers. They went unwillingly, but they\nwent; and the excitement the next day raised the sick from their beds to\ntalk of it, and swept the length and breadth of Cape Cod. The following\nSunday the little church held the largest attendance in its history.\nSeemingly, every man and woman in town had come to hear what more I\nwould say about the trouble, but I ignored the whole matter. I preached\nthe sermon I had prepared, the subject of which was as remote from\nchurch quarrels as our atmosphere was remote from peace, and my\ncongregation dispersed with expressions of such artless disappointment\nthat it was all I could do to preserve a dignified gravity.\n\nThat night, however, the war was brought into my camp. At the evening\nmeeting the leader of one of the factions rose to his feet with the\nobvious purpose of starting trouble. He was a retired sea-captain, of\nthe ruthless type that knocks a man down with a belaying-pin, and\nhe made his attack on me in a characteristically \"straight from the\nshoulder\" fashion. He began with the proposition that my morning sermon\nhad been \"entirely contrary to the Scriptures,\" and for ten minutes\nhe quoted and misquoted me, hammering in his points. I let him go on\nwithout interruption. Then he added:\n\n\"And this gal comes to this church and undertakes to tell us how we\nshall pray. That's a highhanded measure, and I, for one, ain't goin' to\nstand it. I want to say right here that I shall pray as I like, when\nI like, and where I like. I have prayed in this heavenly way for fifty\nyears before that gal was born, and she can't dictate to me now!\"\n\nBy this time the whole congregation was aroused, and cries of \"Sit\ndown!\" \"Sit down!\" came from every side of the church. It was a hard\nmoment, but I was able to rise with some show of dignity. I was hurt\nthrough and through, but my fighting blood was stirring.\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"Captain Sears has the floor. Let him say now all he\nwishes to say, for it is the last time he will ever speak at one of our\nmeetings.\"\n\nCaptain Sears, whose exertions had already made him apoplectic, turned a\ndarker purple. \"What's that?\" he shouted. \"What d'ye mean?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" I replied, \"that I do not intend to allow you or anybody else\nto interfere with my meetings. You are a sea-captain. What would you do\nto me if I came on board your ship and started a mutiny in your crew, or\ntried to give you orders?\"\n\nCaptain Sears did not reply. He stood still, with his legs far apart and\nbraced, as he always stood when talking, but his eyes shifted a little.\nI answered my own question.\n\n\"You would put me ashore or in irons,\" I reminded him. \"Now, Captain\nSears, I intend to put you ashore. I am the master of this ship. I have\nset my course, and I mean to follow it. If you rebel, either you will\nget out or I will. But until the board asks for my resignation, I am in\ncommand.\"\n\nAs it happened, I had put my ultimatum in the one form the old man could\nunderstand. He sat down without a word and stared at me. We sang the\nDoxology, and I dismissed the meeting. Again we had omitted prayers.\nThe next day Captain Sears sent me a letter recalling his subscription\ntoward the support of the church; and for weeks he remained away from\nour services, returning under conditions I will mention later. Even at\nthe time, however, his attack helped rather than hurt me. At the\nregular meeting the following Thursday night no personal criticisms were\nincluded in the prayers, and eventually we had peace. But many battles\nwere lost and won before that happy day arrived.\n\nCaptain Sears's vacant place among us was promptly taken by another\ncaptain in East Dennis, whose name was also Sears. A few days after my\nencounter with the first captain I met the second on the street. He had\nnever come to church, and I stopped and invited him to do so. He replied\nwith simple candor.\n\n\"I ain't comin',\" he told me. \"There ain't no gal that can teach me\nnothin'.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are wrong, Captain Sears,\" I replied. \"I might teach you\nsomething.\"\n\n\"What?\" demanded the captain, with chilling distrust.\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, cheerfully, \"let us say tolerance, for one thing.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" muttered the old man. \"The Lord don't want none of your\ntolerance, and neither do I.\"\n\nI laughed. \"He doesn't object to tolerance,\" I said. \"Come to church.\nYou can talk, too; and the Lord will listen to us both.\"\n\nTo my surprise, the captain came the following Sunday, and during\nthe seven years I remained in the church he was one of my strongest\nsupporters and friends. I needed friends, for my second battle was not\nslow in following my first. There was, indeed, barely time between in\nwhich to care for the wounded.\n\nWe had in East Dennis what was known as the \"Free Religious Group,\" and\nwhen some of the members of my congregation were not wrangling among\nthemselves, they were usually locking horns with this group. For years,\nI was told, one of the prime diversions of the \"Free Religious\" faction\nwas to have a dance in our town hall on the night when we were using\nit for our annual church fair. The rules of the church positively\nprohibited dancing, so the worldly group took peculiar pleasure in\nattending the fair, and during the evening in getting up a dance and\nwhirling about among us, to the horror of our members. Then they spent\nthe remainder of the year boasting of the achievement. It came to my\nears that they had decided to follow this pleasing programme at our\nChristmas church celebration, so I called the church trustees together\nand put the situation to them.\n\n\"We must either enforce our discipline,\" I said, \"or give it up.\nPersonally I do not object to dancing, but, as the church has ruled\nagainst it, I intend to uphold the church. To allow these people to make\nus ridiculous year after year is impossible. Let us either tell them\nthat they may dance or that they may not dance; but whatever we tell\nthem, let us make them obey our ruling.\"\n\nThe trustees were shocked at the mere suggestion of letting them dance.\n\n\"Very well,\" I ended. \"Then they shall not dance. That is understood.\"\n\nCaptain Crowell, the father of my dead friend Mrs. Addy, and himself\nmy best man friend, was a strong supporter of the Free Religious Group.\nWhen its members raced to him with the news that I had said they could\nnot dance at the church's Christmas party, Captain Crowell laughed\ngoodhumoredly and told them to dance as much as they pleased, cheerfully\nadding that he would get them out of any trouble they got into. Knowing\nmy friendship for him, and that I even owed my church appointment to\nhim, the Free Religious people were certain that I would never take\nissue with him on dancing or on any other point. They made all their\npreparations for the dance, therefore, with entire confidence, and\nboasted that the affair would be the gayest they had ever arranged. My\npeople began to look at me with sympathy, and for a time I felt very\nsorry for myself. It seemed sufficiently clear that \"the gal\" was to\nhave more trouble.\n\nOn the night of the party things went badly from the first. There was\nan evident intention among the worst of the Free Religious Group to\nembarrass us at every turn. We opened the exercises with the Lord's\nPrayer, which this element loudly applauded. A live kitten was hung\nhigh on the Christmas tree, where it squalled mournfully beyond reach of\nrescue, and the young men of the outside group threw cake at one another\nacross the hall. Finally tiring of these innocent diversions, they began\nto prepare for their dance, and I protested. The spokesman of the group\nwaved me to one side.\n\n\"Captain Crowell said we could,\" he remarked, airily.\n\n\"Captain Crowell,\" I replied, \"has no authority whatever in this matter.\nThe church trustees have decided that you cannot dance here, and I\nintend to enforce their ruling.\"\n\nIt was interesting to observe how rapidly the men of my congregation\ndisappeared from that hall. Like shadows they crept along the walls\nand vanished through the doors. But the preparations for the dance went\nmerrily on. I walked to the middle of the room and raised my voice.\nI was always listened to, for my hearers always had the hope, usually\nrealized, that I was about to get into more trouble.\n\n\"You are determined to dance,\" I began. \"I cannot keep you from doing\nso. But I can and will make you regret that you have done so. The law\nof the State of Massachusetts is very definite in regard to religious\nmeetings and religious gatherings. This hall was engaged and paid for\nby the Wesleyan Methodist Church, of which I am pastor, and we have full\ncontrol of it to-night. Every man and woman who interrupts our exercises\nby attempting to dance, or by creating a disturbance of any kind, will\nbe arrested to-morrow morning.\"\n\nSurprise at first, then consternation, swept through the ranks of the\nFree Religious Group. They denied the existence of such a law as I had\nmentioned, and I promptly read it aloud to them. The leaders went off\ninto a corner and consulted. By this time not one man in my parish\nwas left in the hall. As a result of the consultation in the corner, a\ncommittee of the would-be dancers came to me and suggested a compromise.\n\n\"Will you agree to arrest the men only?\" they wanted to know.\n\n\"No,\" I declared. \"On the contrary, I shall have the women arrested\nfirst! For the women ought to be standing with me now in the support\nof law and order, instead of siding with the hoodlum element you\nrepresent.\"\n\nThat settled it. No girl or woman dared to go on the dancing-floor,\nand no man cared to revolve merrily by himself. A whisper went round,\nhowever, that the dance would begin when I had left. When the clock\nstruck twelve, at which hour, according to the town rule, the hall had\nto be closed, I was the last person to leave it. Then I locked the\ndoor myself, and carried the key away with me. There had been no Free\nReligious dance that night.\n\nOn the following Sunday morning the attendance at my church broke all\nprevious records. Every seat was occupied and every aisle was filled.\nMen and women came from surrounding towns, and strange horses were\ntied to all the fences in East Dennis. Every person in that church\nwas looking for excitement, and this time my congregation got what it\nexpected. Before I began my sermon I read my resignation, to take effect\nat the discretion of the trustees. Then, as it was presumably my last\nchance to tell the people and the place what I thought of them, I spent\nan hour and a half in fervidly doing so. In my study of English I\nhad acquired a fairly large vocabulary. I think I used it all that\nmorning--certainly I tried to. If ever an erring congregation and\ncommunity saw themselves as they really were, mine did on that occasion.\nI was heartsick, discouraged, and full of resentment and indignation,\nwhich until then had been pent up. Under the arraignment my people\nwrithed and squirmed. I ended:\n\n\"What I am saying hurts you, but in your hearts you know you deserve\nevery word of it. It is high time you saw yourselves as you are--a\ndisgrace to the religion you profess and to the community you live in.\"\n\nI was not sure the congregation would let me finish, but it did. My\nhearers seemed torn by conflicting sentiments, in which anger and\ncuriosity led opposing sides. Many of them left the church in a white\nfury, but others--more than I had expected--remained to speak to me\nand assure me of their sympathy. Once on the streets, different groups\nformed and mingled, and all day the little town rocked with arguments\nfor and against \"the gal.\"\n\nNight brought another surprisingly large attendance. I expected more\ntrouble, and I faced it with difficulty, for I was very tired. Just as I\ntook my place in the pulpit, Captain Sears entered the church and walked\ndown the aisle--the Captain Sears who had left us at my invitation some\nweeks before and had not since attended a church service. I was sure he\nwas there to make another attack on me while I was down, and, expecting\nthe worst, I wearily gave him his opportunity. The big old fellow\nstood up, braced himself on legs far apart, as if he were standing on a\nslippery deck during a high sea, and gave the congregation its biggest\nsurprise of the year.\n\nHe said he had come to make a confession. He had been angry with \"the\ngal\" in the past, as they all knew. But he had heard about the sermon\nshe had preached that morning, and this time she was right. It was high\ntime quarreling and backbiting were stopped. They had been going on too\nlong, and no good could come of them. Moreover, in all the years he\nhad been a member of that congregation he had never until now seen\nthe pulpit occupied by a minister with enough backbone to uphold the\ndiscipline of the church. \"I've come here to say I'm with the gal,\" he\nended. \"Put me down for my original subscription and ten dollars extra!\"\n\nSo we had the old man back again. He was a tower of strength, and he\nstood by me faithfully until he died. The trustees would not accept\nmy resignation (indeed, they refused to consider it at all), and the\ncongregation, when it had thought things over, apparently decided that\nthere might be worse things in the pulpit than \"the gal.\" It was even\nknown to brag of what it called my \"spunk,\" and perhaps it was this\nquality, rather than any other, which I most needed in that particular\nparish at that time. As for me, when the fight was over I dropped it\nfrom my mind, and it had not entered my thoughts for years, until I\nbegan to summon these memories.\n\nAt the end of my first six months in East Dennis I was asked to take on,\nalso, the temporary charge of the Congregational Church at Dennis, two\nmiles and a half away. I agreed to do this until a permanent pastor\ncould be found, on condition that I should preach at Dennis on Sunday\nafternoons, using the same sermon I preached in my own pulpit in the\nmorning. The arrangement worked so well that it lasted for six and a\nhalf years--until I resigned from my East Dennis church. During that\nperiod, moreover, I not only carried the two churches on my shoulders,\nholding three meetings each Sunday, but I entered upon and completed a\ncourse in the Boston Medical School, winning my M.D. in 1885, and I also\nlectured several times a month during the winter seasons. These were,\ntherefore, among the most strenuous as well as the most interesting\nyears of my existence, and I mention the strain of them only to prove my\nlife-long contention, that congenial work, no matter how much there is\nof it, has never yet killed any one!\n\nAfter my battle with the Free Religious Group things moved much more\nsmoothly in the parish. Captain Crowell, instead of resenting my\ndefiance of his ruling, helped to reconcile the divided factions in\nthe church; and though, as I have said, twice afterward I submitted my\nresignation, in each case the fight I was making was for a cause which I\nfirmly believed in and eventually won. My second resignation was brought\nabout by the unwillingness of the church to have me exchange pulpits\nwith the one minister on Cape Cod broad-minded enough to invite me to\npreach in his pulpit. I had done so, and had then sent him a return\ninvitation. He was a gentleman and a scholar, but he was also a\nUnitarian; and though my people were willing to let me preach in his\nchurch, they were loath to let him preach in mine. After a surprising\namount of discussion my resignation put a different aspect on the\nmatter; it also led to the satisfactory ruling that I could exchange\npulpits not only with this minister, but with any other in good standing\nin his own church.\n\nMy third resignation went before the trustees in consequence of my\nprotest from the pulpit against a small drinking and gambling saloon\nin East Dennis; which was rapidly demoralizing our boys. Theoretically,\nonly \"soft drinks\" were sold, but the gambling was open, and the resort\nwas constantly filled with boys of all ages. There were influences back\nof this place which tried to protect it, and its owner was very popular\nin the town. After my first sermon I was waited upon by a committee,\nthat warmly advised me to \"let East Dennis alone\" and confine my\ncriticisms \"to saloons in Boston and other big towns.\" As I had nothing\nto do with Boston, and much to do with East Dennis, I preached on that\nplace three Sundays in succession, and feeling became so intense that I\nhanded in my resignation and prepared to depart. Then my friends rallied\nand the resort was suppressed.\n\nThat was my last big struggle. During the remaining five years of my\npastorate on Cape Cod the relations between my people and myself were\nwholly harmonious and beautiful. If I have seemed to dwell too much on\nthese small victories, it must be remembered that I find in them such\ncomfort as I can. I have not yet won the great and vital fight of my\nlife, to which I have given myself, heart and soul, for the past thirty\nyears--the campaign for woman suffrage. I have seen victories here and\nthere, and shall see more. But when the ultimate triumph comes--when\nAmerican women in every state cast their ballots as naturally as their\nhusbands do--I may not be in this world to rejoice over it.\n\nIt is interesting to remember that during the strenuous period of the\nfirst few months in East Dennis, and notwithstanding the division in\nthe congregation, we women of the church got together and repainted and\nrefurnished the building, raising all the money and doing much of the\nwork ourselves, as the expense of having it done was prohibitive. We\npainted the church, and even cut down and modernized the pulpit. The\ntotal cost of material and furniture was not half so great as the\noriginal estimate had indicated, and we had learned a valuable lesson.\nAfter this we spent very little money for labor, but did our own\ncleaning, carpet-laying, and the like; and our little church, if I may\nbe allowed to say so, was a model of neatness and good taste.\n\nI have said that at the end of two years from the time of my appointment\nthe long-continued warfare in the church was ended. I was not\nimmediately allowed, however, to bask in an atmosphere of harmony, for\nin October, 1880, the celebrated contest over my ordination took place\nat the Methodist Protestant Conference in Tarrytown, New York; and for\nthree days I was a storm-center around which a large number of truly\ngood and wholly sincere men fought the fight of their religious lives.\nMany of them strongly believed that women were out of place in the\nministry. I did not blame them for this conviction. But I was in the\nministry, and I was greatly handicapped by the fact that, although I was\na licensed preacher and a graduate of the Boston Theological School, I\ncould not, until I had been regularly ordained, meet all the functions\nof my office. I could perform the marriage service, but I could not\nbaptize. I could bury the dead, but I could not take members into my\nchurch. That had to be done by the presiding elder or by some other\nminister. I could not administer the sacraments. So at the New England\nSpring Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, held in Boston in\n1880, I formally applied for ordination. At the same time application\nwas made by another woman--Miss Anna Oliver--and as a preliminary\nstep we were both examined by the Conference board, and were formally\nreported by that board as fitted for ordination. Our names were\ntherefore presented at the Conference, over which Bishop Andrews\npresided, and he immediately refused to accept them. Miss Oliver and\nI were sitting together in the gallery of the church when the bishop\nannounced his decision, and, while it staggered us, it did not really\nsurprise us. We had been warned of this gentleman's deep-seated\nprejudice against women in the ministry.\n\nAfter the services were over Miss Oliver and I called on him and asked\nhim what we should do. He told us calmly that there was nothing for\nus to do but to get out of the Church. We reminded him of our years of\nstudy and probation, and that I had been for two years in charge of two\nchurches. He set his thin lips and replied that there was no place\nfor women in the ministry, and, as he then evidently considered the\ninterview ended, we left him with heavy hearts. While we were walking\nslowly away, Miss Oliver confided to me that she did not intend to leave\nthe Church. Instead, she told me, she would stay in and fight the matter\nof her ordination to a finish. I, however, felt differently. I had done\nconsiderable fighting during the past two years, and my heart and soul\nwere weary. I said: \"I shall get out, I am no better and no stronger\nthan a man, and it is all a man can do to fight the world, the flesh,\nand the devil, without fighting his Church as well. I do not intend to\nfight my Church. But I am called to preach the gospel; and if I cannot\npreach it in my own Church, I will certainly preach it in some other\nChurch!\"\n\nAs if in response to this outburst, a young minister named Mark Trafton\nsoon called to see me. He had been present at our Conference, he had\nseen my Church refuse to ordain me, and he had come to suggest that I\napply for ordination in his Church--the Methodist Protestant. To leave\nmy Church, even though urged to do so by its appointed spokesman, seemed\na radical step. Before taking this I appealed from the decision of the\nConference to the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church,\nwhich held its session that year in Cincinnati, Ohio. Miss Oliver\nalso appealed, and again we were both refused ordination, the General\nConference voting to sustain Bishop Andrews in his decision. Not content\nwith this achievement, the Conference even took a backward step. It\ndeprived us of the right to be licensed as local preachers. After this\nblow I recalled with gratitude the Reverend Mark Trafton's excellent\nadvice, and I immediately applied for ordination in the Methodist\nProtestant Church. My name was presented at the Conference held in\nTarrytown in October, 1880, and the fight was on.\n\nDuring these Conferences it is customary for each candidate to retire\nwhile the discussion of his individual fitness for ordination is in\nprogress. When my name came up I was asked, as my predecessors had\nbeen, to leave the room for a few moments. I went into an anteroom and\nwaited--a half-hour, an hour, all afternoon, all evening, and still\nthe battle raged. I varied the monotony of sitting in the anteroom by\nstrolls around Tarrytown, and I think I learned to know its every stone\nand turn. The next day passed in the same way. At last, late on Saturday\nnight, it was suddenly announced by my opponents that I was not even\na member of the Church in which I had applied for ordination. The\nstatement created consternation among my friends. None of us had thought\nof that! The bomb, timed to explode at the very end of the session,\nthreatened to destroy all my hopes. Of course, my opponents had\nreasoned, it would be too late for me to do anything, and my name would\nbe dropped.\n\nBut it was not too late. Dr. Lyman Davis, the pastor of the Methodist\nProtestant Church in Tarrytown, was very friendly toward me and my\nordination, and he proved his friendship in a singularly prompt and\nefficient fashion. Late as it was, he immediately called together\nthe trustees of his church, and they responded. To them I made my\napplication for church membership, which they accepted within five\nminutes. I was now a member of the Church, but it was too late to obtain\nany further action from the Conference. The next day, Sunday, all the\nmen who had applied for ordination were ordained, and I was left out.\n\nOn Monday morning, however, when the Conference met in its final\nbusiness session, my case was reopened, and I was eventually called\nbefore the members to answer questions. Some of these were extremely\ninteresting, and several of the episodes that occurred were very\namusing. One old gentleman I can see as I write. He was greatly excited,\nand he led the opposition by racing up and down the aisles, quoting\nfrom the Scriptures to prove his case against women ministers. As he\nran about he had a trick of putting his arms under the back of his coat,\nmaking his coat-tails stand out like wings and incidentally revealing\ntwo long white tapestrings belonging to a flannel undergarment. Even\nin the painful stress of those hours I observed with interest how\nbeautifully those tape-strings were ironed!\n\nI was there to answer any questions that were asked of me, and the\nquestions came like hailstones in a sudden summer storm.\n\n\"Paul said, 'Wives, obey your husbands,'\" shouted my old man of the\ncoat-tails. \"Suppose your husband should refuse to allow you to preach?\nWhat then?\"\n\n\"In the first place,\" I answered, \"Paul did not say so, according to\nthe Scriptures. But even if he did, it would not concern me, for I am a\nspinster.\"\n\nThe old man looked me over. \"You might marry some day,\" he predicted,\ncautiously.\n\n\"Possibly,\" I admitted. \"Wiser women than I am have married. But it\nis equally possible that I might marry a man who would command me to\npreach; and in that case I want to be all ready to obey him.\"\n\nAt this another man, a bachelor, also began to draw from the Scriptures.\n\"An elder,\" he quoted, \"shall be the husband of one wife.\" And he\ndemanded, triumphantly, \"How is it possible for you to be the husband of\na wife?\"\n\nIn response to that I quoted a bit myself. \"Paul said, 'Anathema unto\nhim who addeth to or taketh from the Scriptures,'\" I reminded this\ngentleman; and added that a twisted interpretation of the Scriptures was\nas bad as adding to or taking from them, and that no one doubted that\nPaul was warning the elders against polygamy. Then I went a bit further,\nfor by this time the absurd character of the questions was getting on my\nnerves.\n\n\"Even if my good brother's interpretation is correct,\" I said, \"he has\noverlooked two important points. Though he is an elder, he is also a\nbachelor; so I am as much of a husband as he is!\"\n\nA good deal of that sort of thing went on. The most satisfactory episode\nof the session, to me, was the downfall of three pert young men who in\nturn tried to make it appear that as the duty of the Conference was to\nprovide churches for all its pastors, I might become a burden to the\nChurch if it proved impossible to provide a pastorate for me. At that,\none of my friends in the council rose to his feet.\n\n\"I have had official occasion to examine into the matter of Miss Shaw's\nparish and salary,\" he said, \"and I know what salaries the last three\nspeakers are drawing. It may interest the Conference to know that Miss\nShaw's present salary equals the combined salaries of the three young\nmen who are so afraid she will be a burden to the Church. If, before\nbeing ordained, she can earn three times as much as they now earn after\nbeing ordained, it seems fairly clear that they will never have to\nsupport her. We can only hope that she will never have to support them.\"\n\nThe three young ministers subsided into their seats with painful\nabruptness, and from that time my opponents were more careful in their\nremarks. Still, many unpleasant things were said, and too much warmth\nwas shown by both sides. We gained ground through the day, however, and\nat the end of the session the Conference, by a large majority, voted to\nordain me.\n\nThe ordination service was fixed for the following evening, and even the\ngentlemen who had most vigorously opposed me were not averse to making\nthe occasion a profitable one. The contention had already enormously\nadvertised the Conference, and the members now helped the good work\nalong by sending forth widespread announcements of the result. They also\ndecided that, as the attendance at the service would be very large, they\nwould take up a collection for the support of superannuated ministers.\nThe three young men who had feared I would become a burden were\nespecially active in the matter of this collection; and, as they had no\nsense of humor, it did not seem incongruous to them to use my ordination\nas a means of raising money for men who had already become burdens to\nthe Church.\n\nWhen the great night came (on October 12, 1880), the expected crowd came\nalso. And to the credit of my opponents I must add that, having lost\ntheir fight, they took their defeat in good part and gracefully assisted\nin the services. Sitting in one of the front pews was Mrs. Stiles, the\nwife of Dr. Stiles, who was superintendent of the Conference. She was\na dear little old lady of seventy, with a big, maternal heart; and when\nshe saw me rise to walk up the aisle alone, she immediately rose, too,\ncame to my side, offered me her arm, and led me to the altar.\n\nThe ordination service was very impressive and beautiful. Its peace\nand dignity, following the battle that had raged for days, moved me\nso deeply that I was nearly overcome. Indeed, I was on the verge of a\nbreakdown when I was mercifully saved by the clause in the discipline\ncalling for the pledge all ministers had to make--that I would not\nindulge in the use of tobacco. When this vow fell from my lips a\nperceptible ripple ran over the congregation.\n\nI was homesick for my Cape Cod parish, and I returned to East Dennis\nimmediately after my ordination, arriving there on Saturday night.\nI knew by the suppressed excitement of my friends that some surprise\nawaited me, but I did not learn what it was until I entered my dear\nlittle church the following morning. There I found the communion-table\nset forth with a beautiful new communion-service. This had been\npurchased during my absence, that I might dedicate it that day and for\nthe first time administer the sacrament to my people.\n\n\n\n\nVI. CAPE COD MEMORIES\n\nLooking back now upon those days, I see my Cape Cod friends as clearly\nas if the intervening years had been wiped out and we were again\ntogether. Among those I most loved were two widely differing\ntypes--Captain Doane, a retired sea-captain, and Relief Paine, an\ninvalid chained to her couch, but whose beautiful influence permeated\nthe community like an atmosphere. Captain Doane was one of the finest\nmen I have ever known--highminded, tolerant, sympathetic, and full of\nunderstanding, He was not only my friend, but my church barometer. He\noccupied a front pew, close to the pulpit; and when I was preaching\nwithout making much appeal he sat looking me straight in the face,\nlistening courteously, but without interest. When I got into my subject,\nhe would lean forward--the angle at which he sat indicating the\ndegree of attention I had aroused--and when I was strongly holding my\ncongregation Brother Doane would bend toward me, following every word\nI uttered with corresponding motions of his lips. When I resigned we\nparted with deep regret, but it was not until I visited the church\nseveral years afterward that he overcame his reserve enough to tell me\nhow much he had felt my going.\n\n\"Oh, did you?\" I asked, greatly touched. \"You're not saying that merely\nto please me?\"\n\nThe old man's hand fell on my shoulder. \"I miss you,\" he said, simply.\n\"I miss you all the time. You see, I love you.\" Then, with precipitate\nselfconsciousness, he closed the door of his New England heart, and from\nsome remote corner of it sent out his cautious after-thought. \"I love\nyou,\" he repeated, primly, \"as a sister in the Lord.\"\n\nRelief Paine lived in Brewster. Her name seemed prophetic, and she once\ntold me that she had always considered it so. Her brother-in-law was my\nSunday-school superintendent, and her family belonged to my church. Very\nsoon after my arrival in East Dennis I went to see her, and found\nher, as she always was, dressed in white and lying on a tiny white bed\ncovered with pansies, in a room whose windows overlooked the sea. I\nshall never forget the picture she made. Over her shoulders was an\nexquisite white lace shawl brought from the other side of the world by\nsome seafaring friend, and against her white pillow her hair seemed the\nblackest I had ever seen. When I entered she turned and looked toward\nme with wonderful dark eyes that were quite blind, and as she talked her\nhands played with the pansies around her. She loved pansies as she loved\nfew human beings, and she knew their colors by touching them. She was\nthen a little more than thirty years of age. At sixteen she had fallen\ndownstairs in the dark, receiving an injury that paralyzed her, and\nfor fifteen years she had lain on one side, perfectly still, the Stella\nMaris of the Cape. All who came to her, and they were many, went away\nthe better for the visit, and the mere mention of her name along the\ncoast softened eyes that had looked too bitterly on life.\n\nRelief and I became close friends. I was greatly drawn to her, and\ndeeply moved by the tragedy of her situation, as well as by the\nbeautiful spirit with which she bore it. During my first visit I regaled\nher with stories of the community and of my own experiences, and when I\nwas leaving it occurred to me that possibly I had been rather frivolous.\nSo I said:\n\n\"I am coming to see you often, and when I come I want to do whatever\nwill interest you most. Shall I bring some books and read to you?\"\n\nRelief smiled--the gay, mischievous little smile I was soon to know so\nwell, but which at first seemed out of place on the tragic mask of her\nface.\n\n\"No, don't read to me,\" she decided. \"There are enough ready to do that.\nTalk to me. Tell me about our life and our people here, as they strike\nyou.\" And she added, slowly: \"You are a queer minister. You have not\noffered to pray with me!\"\n\n\"I feel,\" I told her, \"more like asking you to pray for me.\"\n\nRelief continued her analysis. \"You have not told me that my affliction\nwas a visitation from God,\" she added; \"that it was discipline and well\nfor me I had it.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it was from God,\" I said. \"I don't believe God had\nanything to do with it. And I rejoice that you have not let it wreck\nyour life.\"\n\nShe pressed my hand. \"Thank you for saying that,\" she murmured. \"If I\nthought God did it I could not love Him, and if I did not love Him I\ncould not live. Please come and see me VERY often--and tell me stories!\"\n\nAfter that I collected stories for Relief. One of those which most\namused her, I remember, was about my horse, and this encourages me to\nrepeat it here. In my life in East Dennis I did not occupy the lonely\nlittle parsonage connected with my church, but instead boarded with a\nfriend--a widow named Crowell. (There seemed only two names in Cape Cod:\nSears and Crowell.) To keep in touch with my two churches, which were\nalmost three miles apart, it became necessary to have a horse. As Mrs.\nCrowell needed one, too, we decided to buy the animal in partnership,\nand Miss Crowell, the daughter of the widow, who knew no more about\nhorses than I did, undertook to lend me the support of her presence and\nadvice during the purchase. We did not care to have the entire community\ntake a passionate interest in the matter, as it would certainly have\ndone if it had heard of our intention; so my friend and I departed\nsomewhat stealthily for a neighboring town, where, we had heard, a very\ngood horse was offered for sale. We saw the animal and liked it; but\nbefore closing the bargain we cannily asked the owner if the horse was\nperfectly sound, and if it was gentle with women. He assured us that it\nwas both sound and gentle with women, and to prove the latter point\nhe had his wife harness it to the buggy and drive it around the\nstable-yard. The animal behaved beautifully. After it had gone through\nits paces, Miss Crowell and I leaned confidingly against its side,\npatting it and praising its beauty, and the horse seemed to enjoy our\nattentions. We bought it then and there, drove it home, and put it in\nour barn; and the next morning we hired a man in the neighborhood to\ncome over and take care of it.\n\nHe arrived. Five minutes later a frightful racket broke out in the\nbarn--sounds of stamping, kicking, and plunging, mingled with loud\nshouts. We ran to the scene of the trouble, and found our \"hired man\"\nrushing breathlessly toward the house. When he was able to speak he\ninformed us that we had \"a devil in there,\" pointing back to the barn,\nand that the new horse's legs were in the air, all four of them at once,\nthe minute he went near her. We insisted that he must have frightened or\nhurt her, but, solemnly and with anxious looks behind, he protested that\nhe had not. Finally Miss Crowell and I went into the barn, and received\na dignified welcome from the new horse, which seemed pleased by our\nvisit. Together we harnessed her and, without the least difficulty,\ndrove her out into the yard. As soon as our man took the reins, however,\nshe reared, kicked, and smashed our brand-new buggy. We changed the man\nand had the buggy repaired, but by the end of the week the animal had\nsmashed the buggy again. Then, with some natural resentment, we made a\nsecond visit to the man from whom we had bought her, and asked him why\nhe had sold us such a horse.\n\nHe said he had told us the exact truth. The horse WAS sound and she WAS\nextremely gentle with women, but--and this point he had seen no reason\nto mention, as we had not asked about it--she would not let a man come\nnear her. He firmly refused to take her back, and we had to make the\nbest of the bargain. As it was impossible to take care of her ourselves,\nI gave some thought to the problem she presented, and finally devised a\nplan which worked very well. I hired a neighbor who was a small, slight\nman to take care of her, and made him wear his wife's sunbonnet and\nwaterproof cloak whenever he approached the horse. The picture he\npresented in these garments still stands out pleasantly against the\nbackground of my Cape Cod memories. The horse, however, did not share\nour appreciation of it. She was suspicious, and for a time she shied\nwhenever the man and his sunbonnet and cloak appeared; but we stood by\nuntil she grew accustomed to them and him; and as he was both patient\nand gentle, she finally allowed him to harness and unharness her. But\nno man could drive her, and when I drove to church I was forced to hitch\nand unhitch her myself. No one else could do it, though many a gallant\nand subsequently resentful man attempted the feat.\n\nOn one occasion a man I greatly disliked, and who I had reason to know\ndisliked me, insisted that he could unhitch her, and started to do so,\nnotwithstanding my protests and explanations. At his approach she rose\non her hind-legs, and when he grasped her bridle she lifted him off his\nfeet. His expression as he hung in mid-air was an extraordinary mixture\nof surprise and regret. The moment I touched her, however, she quieted\ndown, and when I got into the buggy and gathered up the reins she\nwalked off like a lamb, leaving the man staring after her with his eyes\nstarting from his head.\n\nThe previous owner had called the horse Daisy, and we never changed the\nname, though it always seemed sadly inappropriate. Time proved, however,\nthat there were advantages in the ownership of Daisy. No man would allow\nhis wife or daughter to drive behind her, and no one wanted to borrow\nher. If she had been a different kind of animal she would have been\nused by the whole community, We kept Daisy for seven years, and our\nacquaintance ripened into a pleasant friendship.\n\nAnother Cape Cod resident to whose memory I must offer tribute in\nthese pages was Polly Ann Sears--one of the dearest and best of my\nparishioners. She had six sons, and when five had gone to sea she\ninsisted that the sixth must remain at home. In vain the boy begged\nher to let him follow his brothers. She stood firm. The sea, she said,\nshould not swallow all her boys; she had given it five--she must keep\none.\n\nAs it happened, the son she kept at home was the only one who was\ndrowned. He was caught in a fish-net and dragged under the waters of\nthe bay near his home; and when I went to see his mother to offer such\ncomfort as I could, she showed that she had learned the big lesson of\nthe experience.\n\n\"I tried to be a special Providence,\" she moaned, \"and the one boy I\nkept home was the only boy I lost. I ain't a-goin' to be a Providence no\nmore.\"\n\nThe number of funerals on Cape Cod was tragically large. I was in\ngreat demand on these occasions, and went all over the Cape, conducting\nfuneral services--which seemed to be the one thing people thought I\ncould do--and preaching funeral sermons. Besides the victims of the sea,\nmany of the residents who had drifted away were brought back to\nsleep their last sleep within sound of the waves. Once I asked an old\nsea-captain why so many Cape Cod men and women who had been gone for\nyears asked to be buried near their old homes, and his reply still\nlingers in my memory. He poked his toe in the sand for a moment and then\nsaid, slowly:\n\n\"Wal, I reckon it's because the Cape has such warm, comfortable sand to\nlie down in.\"\n\nMy friend Mrs. Addy lay in the Crowell family lot, and during my\npastorate at East Dennis I preached the funeral sermon of her father,\nand later of her mother. Long after I had left Cape Cod I was frequently\ncalled back to say the last words over the coffins of my old friends,\nand the saddest of those journeys was the one I made in response to\na telegram from the mother of Relief Paine. When I had arrived and we\nstood together beside the exquisite figure that seemed hardly more quiet\nin death than in life, Mrs. Paine voiced in her few words the feeling\nof the whole community--\"Where shall we get our comfort and our\ninspiration, now that Relief is gone?\"\n\nThe funeral which took all my courage from me, however, was that of\nmy sister Mary. In its suddenness, Mary's death, in 1883, was as a\nthunderbolt from the blue; for she had been in perfect health three days\nbefore she passed away. I was still in charge of my two parishes in\nCape Cod, but, as it mercifully happened, before she was stricken I had\nstarted West to visit Mary in her home at Big Rapids. When I arrived\non the second day of her illness, knowing nothing of it until I reached\nher, I found her already past hope. Her disease was pneumonia, but she\nwas conscious to the end, and her greatest desire seemed to be to see me\nchristen her little daughter and her husband before she left them. This\ncould not be realized, for my brotherin-law was absent on business,\nand with all his haste in returning did not reach his wife's side until\nafter her death. As his one thought then was to carry out her last\nwishes, I christened him and his little girl just before the funeral;\nand during the ceremony we all experienced a deep conviction that Mary\nknew and was content.\n\nShe had become a power in her community, and was so dearly loved that\non the day her body was borne to its last resting-place all the business\nhouses in Big Rapids were closed, and the streets were filled with men\nwho stood with bent, uncovered heads as the funeral procession went by.\nMy father and mother, also, to whom she had given a home after they left\nthe log-cabin where they had lived so long, had made many friends in\ntheir new environment and were affectionately known throughout the whole\nregion as \"Grandma and Grandpa Shaw.\"\n\nWhen I returned to East Dennis I brought my mother and Mary's three\nchildren with me, and they remained throughout the spring and summer.\nI had hoped that they would remain permanently, and had rented and\nfurnished a home for them with that end in view; but, though they\nenjoyed their visit, the prospect of the bleak winters of Cape Cod\ndisturbed my mother, and they all returned to Big Rapids late in the\nautumn. Since entering upon my parish work it had been possible for me\nto help my father and mother financially; and from the time of Mary's\ndeath I had the privilege, a very precious one, of seeing that they were\nwell cared for and contented. They were always appreciative, and as time\npassed they became more reconciled to the career I had chosen, and which\nin former days had filled them with such dire forebodings.\n\n\nAfter I had been in East Dennis four years I began to feel that I\nwas getting into a rut. It seemed to me that all I could do in that\nparticular field had been done. My people wished me to remain, however,\nand so, partly as an outlet for my surplus energy, but more especially\nbecause I realized the splendid work women could do as physicians, I\nbegan to study medicine. The trustees gave me permission to go to Boston\non certain days of each week, and we soon found that I could carry on my\nwork as a medical student without in the least neglecting my duty toward\nmy parish.\n\nI entered the Boston Medical School in 1882, and obtained my diploma\nas a full-fledged physician in 1885. During this period I also began to\nlecture for the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, of which\nLucy Stone was president. Henry Blackwell was associated with her, and\ntogether they developed in me a vital interest in the suffrage cause,\nwhich grew steadily from that time until it became the dominating\ninfluence in my life. I preached it in the pulpit, talked it to those I\nmet outside of the church, lectured on it whenever I had an opportunity,\nand carried it into my medical work in the Boston slums when I was\ntrying my prentice hand on helpless pauper patients.\n\nHere again, in my association with the women of the streets, I realized\nthe limitations of my work in the ministry and in medicine. As minister\nto soul and body one could do little for these women. For such as them,\none's efforts must begin at the very foundation of the social structure.\nLaws for them must be made and enforced, and some of those laws could\nonly be made and enforced by women. So many great avenues of life were\nopening up before me that my Cape Cod environment seemed almost a prison\nwhere I was held with tender force. I loved my people and they loved\nme--but the big outer world was calling, and I could not close my ears\nto its summons. The suffrage lectures helped to keep me contented,\nhowever, and I was certainly busy enough to find happiness in my work.\n\nI was in Boston three nights a week, and during these nights subject\nto sick calls at any hour. My favorite associates were Dr. Caroline\nHastings, our professor of anatomy, and little Dr. Mary Safford, a\nmite of a woman with an indomitable soul. Dr. Safford was especially\nprominent in philanthropic work in Massachusetts, and it was said of her\nthat at any hour of the day or night she could be found working in the\nslums of Boston. I, too, could frequently be found there--often, no\ndoubt, to the disadvantage of my patients. I was quite famous in three\nBoston alleys--Maiden's Lane, Fellows Court, and Andrews Court. It most\nfortunately happened that I did not lose a case in those alleys, though\nI took all kinds, as I had to treat a certain number of surgical and\nobstetrical cases in my course. No doubt my patients and I had many\nnarrow escapes of which we were blissfully ignorant, but I remember\ntwo which for a long time afterward continued to be features of my most\ntroubled dreams.\n\nThe first was that of a big Irishman who had pneumonia. When I looked\nhim over I was as much frightened as he was. I had got as far as\npneumonia in my course, and I realized that here was a bad case of it.\nI knew what to do. The patient must be carefully packed in towels wrung\nout of cold water. When I called for towels I found that there was\nnothing in the place but a dish-towel, which I washed with portentous\ngravity. The man owned but one shirt, and, in deference to my visit,\nhis wife had removed that to wash it. I packed the patient in the\ndish-towel, wrapped him in a piece of an old shawl, and left after\ninstructing his wife to repeat the process. When I reached home I\nremembered that the patient must be packed \"carefully,\" and I knew that\nhis wife would do it carelessly. That meant great risk to the man's\nlife. My impulse was to rush back to him at once, but this would never\ndo. It would destroy all confidence in the doctor. I walked the floor\nfor three hours, and then casually strolled in upon my patient, finding\nhim, to my great relief, better than I had left him. As I was leaving, a\nchild rushed into the room, begging me to come to an upper floor in the\nsame building.\n\n\"The baby's got the croup,\" she gasped, \"an' he's chokin' to death.\"\n\nWe had not reached croup in our course, and I had no idea what to do,\nbut I valiantly accompanied the little girl. As we climbed the long\nflights of stairs to the top floor I remembered a conversation I had\noverheard between two medical students. One of them had said: \"If the\nchild is strangling when it inhales, as if it were breathing through a\nsponge, then give it spongia; but if it is strangling when it breathes\nout, give it aconite.\"\n\nWhen I reached the baby I listened, but could not tell which way it was\nstrangling. However, I happened to have both medicines with me, so\nI called for two glasses and mixed the two remedies, each in its\nown glass. I gave them both to the mother, and told her to use them\nalternately, every fifteen minutes, until the baby was better. The baby\ngot well; but whether its recovery was due to the spongia or to the\naconite I never knew.\n\nIn my senior year I fell in love with an infant of three, named Patsy.\nHe was one of nine children when I was called to deliver his mother of\nher tenth child. She was drunk when I reached her, and so were two men\nwho lay on the floor in the same room. I had them carried out, and after\nthe mother and baby had been attended to I noticed Patsy. He was the\nmost beautiful child I had ever seen--with eyes like Italian skies and\nyellow hair in tight curls over his adorable little head; but he was\ncovered with filthy rags. I borrowed him, took him home with me, and fed\nand bathed him, and the next day fitted him out with new clothes. Every\nhour I had him tightened his hold on my heart-strings. I went to his\nmother and begged her to let me keep him, but she refused, and after a\ngreat deal of argument and entreaty I had to return him to her. When I\nwent to see him a few days later I found him again in his horrible rags.\nHis mother had pawned his new clothes for drink, and she was deeply\nunder its influence. But no pressure I could exert then or later would\nmake her part with Patsy. Finally, for my own peace of mind, I had\nto give up hope of getting him--but I have never ceased to regret the\nlittle adopted son I might have had.\n\n\n\n\nVII. THE GREAT CAUSE\n\nThere is a theory that every seven years each human being undergoes\na complete physical reconstruction, with corresponding changes in his\nmental and spiritual make-up. Possibly it was due to this reconstruction\nthat, at the end of seven years on Cape Cod, my soul sent forth a sudden\ncall to arms. I was, it reminded me, taking life too easily; I was\nin danger of settling into an agreeable routine. The work of my two\nchurches made little drain on my superabundant vitality, and not\neven the winning of a medical degree and the increasing demands of my\nactivities on the lecture platform wholly eased my conscience. I was\nhappy, for I loved my people and they seemed to love me. It would have\nbeen pleasant to go on almost indefinitely, living the life of a country\nminister and telling myself that what I could give to my flock made such\na life worth while.\n\nBut all the time, deep in my heart, I realized the needs of the outside\nworld, and heard its prayer for workers. My theological and medical\ncourses in Boston, with the experiences that accompanied them, had\ngreatly widened my horizon. Moreover, at my invitation, many of the\nnoble women of the day were coming to East Dennis to lecture, bringing\nwith them the stirring atmosphere of the conflicts they were waging.\nOne of the first of these was my friend Mary A. Livermore; and after her\ncame Julia Ward Howe, Anna Garlin Spencer, Lucy Stone, Mary F. Eastman,\nand many others, each charged with inspiration for my people and with\na special message for me, which she sent forth unknowingly and which\nI alone heard. They were fighting great battles, these women--for\nsuffrage, for temperance, for social purity--and in every word they\nuttered I heard a rallying-cry. So it was that, in 1885, I suddenly\npulled myself up to a radical decision and sent my resignation to the\ntrustees of the two churches whose pastor I had been since 1878.\n\nThe action caused a demonstration of regret which made it hard to keep\nto my resolution and leave these men and women whose friendship was\namong the dearest of my possessions. But when we had all talked things\nover, many of them saw the situation as I did. No doubt there were\nthose, too, who felt that a change of ministry would be good for the\nchurches. During the weeks that followed my resignation I received many\nodd tributes, and of these one of the most amusing came from a young\ngirl in the parish, who broke into loud protests when she heard that I\nwas going away. To comfort her I predicted that she would now have a man\nminister--doubtless a very nice man. But the young person continued to\nsniffle disconsolately.\n\n\"I don't want a man,\" she wailed. \"I don't like to see men in pulpits.\nThey look so awkward.\" Her grief culminated in a final outburst.\n\"They're all arms and legs!\" she sobbed.\n\nWhen my resignation was finally accepted, and the time of my departure\ndrew near, the men of the community spent much of their leisure in\ndiscussing it and me. The social center of East Dennis was a certain\ngrocery, to which almost every man in town regularly wended his way,\nand from which all the gossip of the town emanated. Here the men sat\nfor hours, tilted back in their chairs, whittling the rungs until they\nnearly cut the chairs from under them, and telling one another all they\nknew or had heard about their fellow-townsmen. Then, after each session,\nthey would return home and repeat the gossip to their wives. I used to\nsay that I would give a dollar to any woman in East Dennis who could\nquote a bit of gossip which did not come from the men at that grocery.\nEven my old friend Captain Doane, fine and high-minded citizen though\nhe was, was not above enjoying the mild diversion of these social\ngatherings, and on one occasion at least he furnished the best part of\nthe entertainment. The departing minister was, it seemed, the topic of\nthe day's discussion, and, to tease Captain Doane one young man who\nknew the strength of his friendship for me suddenly began to speak, then\npursed up his lips and looked eloquently mysterious. As he had expected,\nCaptain Doane immediately pounced on him.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" demanded the old man. \"Hev you got\nanything agin Miss Shaw?\"\n\nThe young man sighed and murmured that if he wished he could repeat a\ncharge never before made against a Cape Cod minister, but--and he shut\nhis lips more obviously. The other men, who were in the plot, grinned,\nand this added the last touch to Captain Doane's indignation. He sprang\nto his feet. One of his peculiarities was a constant misuse of words,\nand now, in his excitement, he outdid himself.\n\n\"You've made an incineration against Miss Shaw,\" he shouted. \"Do you\nhear--AN INCINERATION! Take it back or take a lickin'!\"\n\nThe young man decided that the joke had gone far enough, so he answered,\nmildly: \"Well, it is said that all the women in town are in love with\nMiss Shaw. Has that been charged against any other minister here?\"\n\nThe men roared with laughter, and Captain Doane sat down, looking\nsheepish.\n\n\"All I got to say is this,\" he muttered: \"That gal has been in this\ncommunity for seven years, and she 'ain't done a thing during the hull\nseven years that any one kin lay a finger on!\"\n\nThe men shouted again at this back-handed tribute, and the old fellow\nleft the grocery in a huff. Later I was told of the \"incineration\" and\nhis eloquent defense of me, and I thanked him for it. But I added:\n\n\"I hear you said I haven't done a thing in seven years that any one can\nlay a finger on?\"\n\n\"I said it,\" declared the Captain, \"and I'll stand by it.\"\n\n\"Haven't I done any good?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sartin you have,\" he assured me, heartily. \"Lots of good.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"can't you put your finger on that?\"\n\nThe Captain looked startled. \"Why--why--Sister Shaw,\" he stammered,\n\"you know I didn't mean THAT! What I meant,\" he repeated, slowly and\nsolemnly, \"was that the hull time you been here you ain't done nothin'\nanybody could put a finger on!\"\n\nCaptain Doane apparently shared my girl parishioner's prejudice against\nmen in the pulpit, for long afterward, on one of my visits to Cape Cod,\nhe admitted that he now went to church very rarely.\n\n\"When I heard you preach,\" he explained, \"I gen'ally followed you\nthrough and I knowed where you was a-comin' out. But these young fellers\nthat come from the theological school--why, Sister Shaw, the Lord\nHimself don't know where they're comin' out!\"\n\nFor a moment he pondered. Then he uttered a valedictory which I have\nalways been glad to recall as his last message, for I never saw him\nagain.\n\n\"When you fust come to us,\" he said, \"you had a lot of crooked places,\nan' we had a lot of crooked places; and we kind of run into each other,\nall of us. But before you left, Sister Shaw, why, all the crooked places\nwas wore off and everything was as smooth as silk.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I agreed, \"and that was the time to leave--when everything was\nrunning smoothly.\"\n\nAll is changed on Cape Cod since those days, thirty years ago. The old\nfamilies have died or moved away, and those who replaced them were of a\ndifferent type. I am happy in having known and loved the Cape as it was,\nand in having gathered there a store of delightful memories. In later\nstrenuous years it has rested me merely to think of the place, and long\nafterward I showed my continued love of it by building a home there,\nwhich I still possess. But I had little time to rest in this or in my\nMoylan home, of which I shall write later, for now I was back in Boston,\nliving my new life, and each crowded hour brought me more to do.\n\nWe were entering upon a deeply significant period. For the first time\nwomen were going into industrial competition with men, and already\nmen were intensely resenting their presence. Around me I saw women\noverworked and underpaid, doing men's work at half men's wages, not\nbecause their work was inferior, but because they were women. Again,\ntoo, I studied the obtrusive problems of the poor and of the women\nof the streets; and, looking at the whole social situation from every\nangle, I could find but one solution for women--the removal of the\nstigma of disfranchisement. As man's equal before the law, woman could\ndemand her rights, asking favors from no one. With all my heart I joined\nin the crusade of the men and women who were fighting for her. My real\nwork had begun.\n\nNaturally, at this period, I frequently met the members of Boston's most\ninspiring group--the Emersons and John Greenleaf Whittier, James Freeman\nClark, Reverend Minot Savage, Bronson Alcott and his daughter Louisa,\nWendell Phillips, William Lloyd Garrison, Stephen Foster, Theodore Weld,\nand the rest. Of them all, my favorite was Whittier. He had been present\nat my graduation from the theological school, and now he often attended\nour suffrage meetings. He was already an old man, nearing the end of\nhis life; and I recall him as singularly tall and thin, almost gaunt,\nbending forward as he talked, and wearing an expression of great\nserenity and benignity. I once told Susan B. Anthony that if I needed\nhelp in a crowd of strangers that included her, I would immediately\nturn to her, knowing from her face that, whatever I had done, she would\nunderstand and assist me. I could have offered the same tribute to\nWhittier. At our meetings he was like a vesper-bell chiming above a\nbattle-field. Garrison always became excited during our discussions, and\nthe others frequently did; but Whittier, in whose big heart the love\nof his fellow-man burned as unquenchably as in any heart there, always\npreserved his exquisite tranquillity.\n\nOnce, I remember, Stephen Foster insisted on having the word \"tyranny\"\nput into a resolution, stating that women were deprived of suffrage by\nthe TYRANNY of men. Mr. Garrison objected, and the debate that followed\nwas the most exciting I have ever heard. The combatants actually had\nto adjourn before they could calm down sufficiently to go on with\ntheir meeting. Knowing the stimulating atmosphere to which he had grown\naccustomed, I was not surprised to have Theodore Weld explain to me;\nlong afterward, why he no longer attended suffrage meetings.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"why should I go? There hasn't been any one mobbed in\ntwenty years!\"\n\nThe Ralph Waldo Emersons occasionally attended our meetings, and Mr.\nEmerson, at first opposed to woman suffrage, became a convert to it\nduring the last years of his life--a fact his son and daughter omitted\nto mention in his biography. After his death I gave two suffrage\nlectures in Concord, and each time Mrs. Emerson paid for the hall. At\nthese lectures Louisa M. Alcott graced the assembly with her splendid,\nwholesome presence, and on both occasions she was surrounded by a group\nof boys. She frankly cared much more for boys than for girls, and boys\ninevitably gravitated to her whenever she entered a place where they\nwere. When women were given school suffrage in Massachusetts, Miss\nAlcott was the first woman to vote in Concord, and she went to the polls\naccompanied by a group of her boys, all ardently \"for the Cause.\" My\ngeneral impression of her was that of a fresh breeze blowing over wide\nmoors. She was as different as possible from exquisite little Mrs.\nEmerson, who, in her daintiness and quiet charm, suggested an old New\nEngland garden.\n\nOf Abby May and Edna Cheney I retain a general impression of\n\"bagginess\"--of loose jackets over loose waistbands, of escaping locks\nof hair, of bodies seemingly one size from the neck down. Both women\nwere utterly indifferent to the details of their appearance, but they\nwere splendid workers and leading spirits in the New England Woman's\nClub. It was said to be the trouble between Abby May and Kate Gannett\nWells, both of whom stood for the presidency of the club, that led to\nthe beginning of the anti-suffrage movement in Boston. Abby May was\nelected president, and all the suffragists voted for her. Subsequently\nKate Gannett Wells began her anti-suffrage campaign. Mrs. Wells was the\nfirst anti-suffragist I ever knew in this country. Before her there had\nbeen Mrs. Dahlgren, wife of Admiral Dahlgren, and Mrs. William Tecumseh\nSherman. On one occasion Elizabeth Cady Stanton challenged Mrs. Dahlgren\nto a debate on woman suffrage, and in the light of later events Mrs.\nDahlgren's reply is amusing. She declined the challenge, explaining that\nfor anti-suffragists to appear upon a public platform would be a\ndirect violation of the principle for which they stood--which was the\nprotection of female modesty! Recalling this, and the present hectic\nactivity of the anti-suffragists, one must feel that they have either\nabandoned their principle or widened their views. For Julia Ward Howe I\nhad an immense admiration; but, though from first to last I saw much of\nher, I never felt that I really knew her. She was a woman of the widest\nculture, interested in every progressive movement. With all her big\nheart she tried to be a democrat, but she was an aristocrat to the very\ncore of her, and, despite her wonderful work for others, she lived in\na splendid isolation. Once when I called on her I found her resting her\nmind by reading Greek, and she laughingly admitted that she was using\na Latin pony, adding that she was growing \"rusty.\" She seemed a little\nembarrassed by being caught with the pony, but she must have been\nreassured by my cheerful confession that if _I_ tried to read either\nLatin or Greek I should need an English pony.\n\nOf Frances E. Willard, who frequently came to Boston, I saw a great\ndeal, and we soon became closely associated in our work. Early in our\nfriendship, and at Miss Willard's suggestion, we made a compact that\nonce a week each of us would point out to the other her most serious\nfaults, and thereby help her to remedy them; but we were both too sane\nto do anything of the kind, and the project soon died a natural death.\nThe nearest I ever came to carrying it out was in warning Miss Willard\nthat she was constantly defying all the laws of personal hygiene. She\nnever rested, rarely seemed to sleep, and had to be reminded at the\ntable that she was there for the purpose of eating food. She was always\nabsorbed in some great interest, and oblivious to anything else, I never\nknew a woman who could grip an audience and carry it with her as she\ncould. She was intensely emotional, and swayed others by their emotions\nrather than by logic; yet she was the least conscious of her physical\nexistence of any one I ever knew, with the exception of Susan B.\nAnthony. Like \"Aunt Susan,\" Miss Willard paid no heed to cold or heat or\nhunger, to privation or fatigue. In their relations to such trifles both\nwomen were disembodied spirits.\n\nAnother woman doing wonderful work at this time was Mrs. Quincy Shaw,\nwho had recently started her day nurseries for the care of tenement\nchildren whose mothers labored by the day. These nurseries were new in\nBoston, as was the kindergarten system she also established. I saw the\neffect of her work in the lives of the people, and it strengthened my\ngrowing conviction that little could be done for the poor in a spiritual\nor educational way until they were given a certain amount of physical\ncomfort, and until more time was devoted to the problem of prevention.\nIndeed, the more I studied economic issues, the more strongly I felt\nthat the position of most philanthropists is that of men who stand at\nthe bottom of a precipice gathering up and trying to heal those who\nfall into it, instead of guarding the top and preventing them from going\nover.\n\nOf course I had to earn my living; but, though I had taken my medical\ndegree only a few months before leaving Cape Cod, I had no intention\nof practising medicine. I had merely wished to add a certain amount\nof medical knowledge to my mental equipment. The Massachusetts Woman\nSuffrage Association, of which Lucy Stone was president, had frequently\nemployed me as a lecturer during the last two years of my pastorate. Now\nit offered me a salary of one hundred dollars a month as a lecturer and\norganizer. Though I may not have seemed so in these reminiscences, in\nwhich I have written as freely of my small victories as of my struggles\nand failures, I was a modest young person. The amount seemed too large,\nand I told Mrs. Stone as much, after which I humbly fixed my salary at\nfifty dollars a month. At the end of a year of work I felt that I had\n\"made good\"; then I asked for and received the one hundred dollars a\nmonth originally offered me.\n\nDuring my second year Miss Cora Scott Pond and I organized and carried\nthrough in Boston a great suffrage bazaar, clearing six thousand dollars\nfor the association--a large amount in those days. Elated by my share in\nthis success, I asked that my salary should be increased to one hundred\nand twenty-five dollars a month--but this was not done. Instead, I\nreceived a valuable lesson. It was freely admitted that my work was\nworth one hundred and twenty-five dollars, but I was told that one\nhundred was the limit which could be paid, and I was reminded that this\nwas a good salary for a woman.\n\nThe time seemed to have come to make a practical stand in defense of\nmy principles, and I did so by resigning and arranging an independent\nlecture tour. The first month after my resignation I earned three\nhundred dollars. Later I frequently earned more than that, and very\nrarely less. Eventually I lectured under the direction of the Slaton\nLecture Bureau of Chicago, and later still for the Redpath Bureau of\nBoston. My experience with the Redpath people was especially gratifying.\nMrs. Livermore, who was their only woman lecturer, was growing old and\nanxious to resign her work. She saw in me a possible successor, and\nasked them to take me on their list. They promptly refused, explaining\nthat I must \"make a reputation\" before they could even consider me. A\nyear later they wrote me, making a very good offer, which I accepted. It\nmay be worth while to mention here that through my lecture-work at this\nperiod I earned all the money I have ever saved. I lectured night after\nnight, week after week, month after month, in \"Chautauquas\" in the\nsummer, all over the country in the winter, earning a large income and\nputting aside at that time the small surplus I still hold in preparation\nfor the \"rainy day\" every working-woman inwardly fears.\n\nI gave the public at least a fair equivalent for what it gave me, for I\nput into my lectures all my vitality, and I rarely missed an engagement,\nthough again and again I risked my life to keep one. My special\nsubjects, of course, were the two I had most at heart-suffrage and\ntemperance. For Frances Willard, then President of the Woman's Christian\nTemperance Union, had persuaded me to head the Franchise Department of\nthat organization, succeeding Ziralda Wallace, the mother of Gen.\nLew Wallace; and Miss Susan B. Anthony, who was beginning to study me\nclosely, soon swung me into active work with her, of which, later, I\nshall have much to say. But before taking up a subject as absorbing to\nme as my friendship for and association with the most wonderful woman\nI have ever known, it may be interesting to record a few of my pioneer\nexperiences in the lecture-field.\n\nIn those days--thirty years ago--the lecture bureaus were wholly\nregardless of the comfort of their lecturers. They arranged a schedule\nof engagements with exactly one idea in mind--to get the lecturer from\none lecture-point to the next, utterly regardless of whether she had\ntime between for rest or food or sleep. So it happened that\nall-night journeys in freight-cars, engines, and cabooses were casual\ncommonplaces, while thirty and forty mile drives across the country in\nblizzards and bitter cold were equally inevitable. Usually these things\ndid not trouble me. They were high adventures which I enjoyed at the\ntime and afterward loved to recall. But there was an occasional hiatus\nin my optimism.\n\nOne night, for example, after lecturing in a town in Ohio, it was\nnecessary to drive eight miles across country to a tiny railroad station\nat which a train, passing about two o'clock in the morning, was to be\nflagged for me. When we reached the station it was closed, but my driver\ndeposited me on the platform and drove away, leaving me alone. The\nnight was cold and very dark. All day I had been feeling ill and in the\nevening had suffered so much pain that I had finished my lecture with\ngreat difficulty. Now toward midnight, in this desolate spot, miles from\nany house, I grew alarmingly worse. I am not easily frightened, but that\ntime I was sure I was going to die. Off in the darkness, very far away,\nas it seemed, I saw a faint light, and with infinite effort I dragged\nmyself toward it. To walk, even to stand, was impossible; I crawled\nalong the railroad track, collapsing, resting, going on again, whipping\nmy will power to the task of keeping my brain clear, until after a\nnightmare that seemed to last through centuries I lay across the door of\nthe switch-tower in which the light was burning. The switchman stationed\nthere heard the cry I was able to utter, and came to my assistance. He\ncarried me up to his signal-room and laid me on the floor by the stove;\nhe had nothing to give me except warmth and shelter; but these were now\nall I asked. I sank into a comatose condition shot through with pain.\nToward two o'clock in the morning he waked me and told me my train was\ncoming, asking if I felt able to take it. I decided to make the effort.\nHe dared not leave his post to help me, but he signaled to the train,\nand I began my progress back to the station. I never clearly remembered\nhow I got there; but I arrived and was helped into a car by a brakeman.\nAbout four o'clock in the morning I had to change again, but this time I\nwas left at the station of a town, and was there met by a man whose wife\nhad offered me hospitality. He drove me to their home, and I was cared\nfor. What I had, it developed, was a severe case of ptomaine poisoning,\nand I soon recovered; but even after all these years I do not like to\nrecall that night.\n\nTo be \"snowed in\" was a frequent experience. Once, in Minnesota, I was\none of a dozen travelers who were driven in an omnibus from a country\nhotel to the nearest railroad station, about two miles away. It was\nsnowing hard, and the driver left us on the station platform and\ndeparted. Time passed, but the train we were waiting for did not come.\nA true Western blizzard, growing wilder every moment, had set in, and we\nfinally realized that the train was not coming, and that, moreover, it\nwas now impossible to get back to the hotel. The only thing we could do\nwas to spend the night in the railroad station. I was the only woman in\nthe group, and my fellow-passengers were cattlemen who whiled away the\nhours by smoking, telling stories, and exchanging pocket flasks. The\nstation had a telegraph operator who occupied a tiny box by himself, and\nhe finally invited me to share the privacy of his microscopic quarters.\nI entered them very gratefully, and he laid a board on the floor,\ncovered it with an overcoat made of buffalo-skins, and cheerfully\ninvited me to go to bed. I went, and slept peacefully until morning.\nThen we all returned to the hotel, the men going ahead and shoveling a\npath.\n\nAgain, one Sunday, I was snowbound in a train near Faribault, and this\ntime also I was the only woman among a number of cattlemen. They were an\nodoriferous lot, who smoked diligently and played cards without ceasing,\nbut in deference to my presence they swore only mildly and under their\nbreath. At last they wearied of their game, and one of them rose and\ncame to me.\n\n\"I heard you lecture the other night,\" he said, awkwardly, \"and I've bin\ntellin' the fellers about it. We'd like to have a lecture now.\"\n\nTheir card-playing had seemed to me a sinful thing (I was stricter in\nmy views then than I am to-day), and I was glad to create a diversion.\nI agreed to give them a lecture, and they went through the train, which\nconsisted of two day coaches, and brought in the remaining passengers. A\nfew of them could sing, and we began with a Moody and Sankey hymn or two\nand the appealing ditty, \"Where is my wandering boy to-night?\" in which\nthey all joined with special zest. Then I delivered the lecture, and\nthey listened attentively. When I had finished they seemed to think that\nsome slight return was in order, so they proceeded to make a bed for me.\nThey took the bottoms out of two seats, arranged them crosswise, and\none man folded his overcoat into a pillow. Inspired by this, two others\nimmediately donated their fur overcoats for upper and lower coverings.\nWhen the bed was ready they waved me toward it with a most hospitable\nair, and I crept in between the overcoats and slumbered sweetly until I\nwas aroused the next morning by the welcome music of a snow-plow which\nhad been sent from St. Paul to our rescue. To drive fifty or sixty miles\nin a day to meet a lecture engagement was a frequent experience. I have\nbeen driven across the prairies in June when they were like a mammoth\nflower-bed, and in January when they seemed one huge snow-covered\ngrave--my grave, I thought, at times. Once during a thirty-mile drive,\nwhen the thermometer was twenty degrees below zero, I suddenly\nrealized that my face was freezing. I opened my satchel, took out the\ntissue-paper that protected my best gown, and put the paper over my face\nas a veil, tucking it inside of my bonnet. When I reached my destination\nthe tissue was a perfect mask, frozen stiff, and I had to be lifted\nfrom the sleigh. I was due on the lecture platform in half an hour, so I\ndrank a huge bowl of boiling ginger tea and appeared on time. That\nnight I went to bed expecting an attack of pneumonia as a result of the\nexposure, but I awoke next morning in superb condition. I possess what\nis called \"an iron constitution,\" and in those days I needed it.\n\nThat same winter, in Kansas, I was chased by wolves, and though I had\nbeen more or less intimately associated with wolves in my pioneer life\nin the Michigan woods, I found the occasion extremely unpleasant. During\nthe long winters of my girlhood wolves had frequently slunk around\nour log cabin, and at times in the lumber-camps we had even heard them\nprowling on the roofs. But those were very different creatures from the\ntwo huge, starving, tireless animals that hour after hour loped behind\nthe cutter in which I sat with another woman, who, throughout the whole\nexperience, never lost her head nor her control of our frantic horses.\nThey were mad with terror, for, try as they would, they could not outrun\nthe grim things that trailed us, seemingly not trying to gain on us, but\nkeeping always at the same distance, with a patience that was horrible.\nFrom time to time I turned to look at them, and the picture they made as\nthey came on and on is one I shall never forget. They were so near that\nI could see their eyes and slavering jaws, and they were as noiseless as\nthings in a dream. At last, little by little, they began to gain on us,\nand they were almost within striking distance of the whip, which was our\nonly weapon, when we reached the welcome outskirts of a town and they\nfell back.\n\nSome of the memories of those days have to do with personal encounters,\nbrief but poignant. Once when I was giving a series of Chautauqua\nlectures, I spoke at the Chautauqua in Pontiac, Illinois. The State\nReformatory for Boys was situated in that town, and, after the lecture\nthe superintendent of the Reformatory invited me to visit it and say a\nfew words to the inmates. I went and spoke for half an hour, carrying\naway a memory of the place and of the boys which haunted me for\nmonths. A year later, while I was waiting for a train in the station\nat Shelbyville, a lad about sixteen years old passed me and hesitated,\nlooking as if he knew me. I saw that he wanted to speak and dared not,\nso I nodded to him.\n\n\"You think you know me, don't you?\" I asked, when he came to my side.\n\n\"Yes'm, I do know you,\" he told me, eagerly. \"You are Miss Shaw, and\nyou talked to us boys at Pontiac last year. I'm out on parole now, but I\n'ain't forgot. Us boys enjoyed you the best of any show we ever had!\"\n\nI was touched by this artless compliment, and anxious to know how I had\nwon it, so I asked, \"What did I say that the boys liked?\"\n\nThe lad hesitated. Then he said, slowly, \"Well, you didn't talk as if\nyou thought we were all bad.\"\n\n\"My boy,\" I told him, \"I don't think you are all bad. I know better!\"\n\nAs if I had touched a spring in him, the lad dropped into the seat by\nmy side; then, leaning toward me, he said, impulsively, but almost in a\nwhisper:\n\n\"Say, Miss Shaw, SOME OF US BOYS SAYS OUR PRAYERS!\"\n\nRarely have I had a tribute that moved me more than that shy confidence;\nand often since then, in hours of discouragement or failure, I have\nreminded myself that at least there must have been something in me\nonce to make a lad of that age so open up his heart. We had a long\nand intimate talk, from which grew the abiding interest I feel in boys\ntoday.\n\nNaturally I was sometimes inconvenienced by slight misunderstandings\nbetween local committees and myself as to the subjects of my lectures,\nand the most extreme instance of this occurred in a town where I arrived\nto find myself widely advertised as \"Mrs. Anna Shaw, who whistled before\nQueen Victoria\"! Transfixed, I gaped before the billboards, and by\nreading their additional lettering discovered the gratifying fact that\nat least I was not expected to whistle now. Instead, it appeared, I was\nto lecture on \"The Missing Link.\"\n\nAs usual, I had arrived in town only an hour or two before the time\nfixed for my lecture; there was the briefest interval in which to clear\nup these painful misunderstandings. I repeatedly tried to reach the\nchairman who was to preside at the entertainment, but failed. At last\nI went to the hall at the hour appointed, and found the local committee\nthere, graciously waiting to receive me. Without wasting precious\nminutes in preliminaries, I asked why they had advertised me as the\nwoman who had \"whistled before Queen Victoria.\"\n\n\"Why, didn't you whistle before her?\" they exclaimed in grieved\nsurprise.\n\n\"I certainly did not,\" I explained. \"Moreover, I was never called 'The\nAmerican Nightingale,' and I have never lectured on 'The Missing Link.'\nWhere DID you get that subject? It was not on the list I sent you.\"\n\nThe members of the committee seemed dazed. They withdrew to a corner and\nconsulted in whispers. Then, with clearing brow, the spokesman returned.\n\n\"Why,\" he said, cheerfully, \"it's simple enough! We mixed you up with a\nShaw lady that whistles; and we've been discussing the missing link in\nour debating society, so our citizens want to hear your views.\"\n\n\"But I don't know anything about the missing link,\" I protested, \"and I\ncan't speak on it.\"\n\n\"Now, come,\" they begged. \"Why, you'll have to! We've sold all our\ntickets for that lecture. The whole town has turned out to hear it.\"\n\nThen, as I maintained a depressed silence, one of them had a bright\nidea.\n\n\"I'll tell you how to fix it!\" he cried. \"Speak on any subject you\nplease, but bring in something about the missing link every few minutes.\nThat will satisfy 'em.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I agreed, reluctantly. \"Open the meeting with a song. Get\nthe audience to sing 'America' or 'The Star-spangled Banner.' That will\ngive me a few minutes to think, and I will see what can be done.\"\n\nLed by a very nervous chairman, the big audience began to sing, and\nunder the inspiration of the music the solution of our problem flashed\ninto my mind.\n\n\"It is easy,\" I told myself. \"Woman is the missing link in our\ngovernment. I'll give them a suffrage speech along that line.\"\n\nWhen the song ended I began my part of the entertainment with a portion\nof my lecture on \"The Fate of Republics,\" tracing their growth and\ndecay, and pointing out that what our republic needed to give it a\nstable government was the missing link of woman suffrage. I got along\nadmirably, for every five minutes I mentioned \"the missing link,\" and\nthe audience sat content and apparently interested, while the members of\nthe committee burst into bloom on the platform.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. DRAMA IN THE LECTURE-FIELD\n\nMy most dramatic experience occurred in a city in Michigan, where I was\nmaking a temperance campaign. It was an important lumber and shipping\ncenter, and it harbored much intemperance. The editor of the leading\nnewspaper was with the temperance-workers in our fight there, and he had\nwarned me that the liquor people threatened to \"burn the building over\nmy head\" if I attempted to lecture. We were used to similar threats,\nso I proceeded with my preparations and held the meeting in the town\nskating-rink--a huge, bare, wooden structure.\n\nLectures were rare in that city, and rumors of some special excitement\non this occasion had been circulated; every seat in the rink was filled,\nand several hundred persons stood in the aisles and at the back of the\nbuilding. Just opposite the speaker's platform was a small gallery, and\nabove that, in the ceiling, was a trap-door. Before I had been speaking\nten minutes I saw a man drop through this trap-door to the balcony and\nclimb from there to the main floor. As he reached the floor he shouted\n\"Fire!\" and rushed out into the street. The next instant every person\nin the rink was up and a panic had started. I was very sure there was\nno fire, but I knew that many might be killed in the rush which was\nbeginning. So I sprang on a chair and shouted to the people with the\nfull strength of my lungs:\n\n\"There is no fire! It's only a trick! Sit down! Sit down!\"\n\nThe cooler persons in the crowd at once began to help in this calming\nprocess.\n\n\"Sit down!\" they repeated. \"It's all right! There's no fire! Sit down!\"\n\nIt looked as if we had the situation in hand, for the people hesitated,\nand most of them grew quiet; but just then a few words were hissed up to\nme that made my heart stop beating. A member of our local committee was\nstanding beside my chair, speaking in a terrified whisper:\n\n\"There IS a fire, Miss Shaw,\" he said. \"For God's sake get the people\nout--QUICKLY!\"\n\nThe shock was so unexpected that my knees almost gave way. The people\nwere still standing, wavering, looking uncertainly toward us. I raised\nmy voice again, and if it sounded unnatural my hearers probably thought\nit was because I was speaking so loudly.\n\n\"As we are already standing,\" I cried, \"and are all nervous, a little\nexercise will do us good. So march out, singing. Keep time to the music!\nLater you can come back and take your seats!\"\n\nThe man who had whispered the warning jumped into the aisle and struck\nup \"Jesus, Lover of My Soul.\" Then he led the march down to the door,\nwhile the big audience swung into line and followed him, joining in the\nsong. I remained on the chair, beating time and talking to the people\nas they went; but when the last of them had left the building I almost\ncollapsed; for the flames had begun to eat through the wooden walls and\nthe clang of the fire-engines was heard outside.\n\nAs soon as I was sure every one was safe, however, I experienced the\nmost intense anger I had yet known. My indignation against the men who\nhad risked hundreds of lives by setting fire to a crowded building made\nme \"see red\"; it was clear that they must be taught a lesson then and\nthere. As soon as I was outside the rink I called a meeting, and the\nCongregational minister, who was in the crowd, lent us his church\nand led the way to it. Most of the audience followed us, and we had a\nwonderful meeting, during which we were able at last to make clear to\nthe people of that town the character of the liquor interests we were\nfighting. That episode did the temperance cause more good than a hundred\nordinary meetings. Men who had been indifferent before became our\nfriends and supporters, and at the following election we carried the\ntown for prohibition by a big majority.\n\nThere have been other occasions when our opponents have not fought us\nfairly. Once, in an Ohio town, a group of politicians, hearing that I\nwas to lecture on temperance in the court-house on a certain night,\ntook possession of the building early in the evening, on the pretense of\nholding a meeting, and held it against us. When, escorted by a committee\nof leading women, I reached the building and tried to enter, we found\nthat the men had locked us out. Our audience was gathering and filling\nthe street, and we finally sent a courteous message to the men, assuming\nthat they had forgotten us and reminding them of our position. The\nmessenger reported that the men would leave \"about eight,\" but that the\nroom was \"black with smoke and filthy with tobacco-juice.\" We waited\npatiently until eight o'clock, holding little outside meetings in\ngroups, as our audience waited with us. At eight we again sent our\nmessenger into the hall, and he brought back word that the men were \"not\nthrough, didn't know when they would be through, and had told the women\nnot to wait.\"\n\nNaturally, the waiting townswomen were deeply chagrined by this. So were\nmany men in the outside crowd. We asked if there was no other entrance\nto the hall except through the locked front doors, and were told that\nthe judge's private room opened into it, and that one of our committee\nhad the key, as she had planned to use this room as a dressing and\nretiring room for the speakers. After some discussion we decided to\nstorm the hall and take possession. Within five minutes all the women\nhad formed in line and were crowding up the back stairs and into the\njudge's room. There we unlocked the door, again formed in line, and\nmarched into the hall, singing \"Onward, Christian Soldiers!\"\n\nThere were hundreds of us, and we marched directly to the platform,\nwhere the astonished men got up to stare at us. More and more women\nentered, coming up the back stairs from the street and filling the hall;\nand when the men realized what it all meant, and recognized their wives,\nsisters, and women friends in the throng, they sheepishly unlocked the\nfront doors and left us in possession, though we politely urged them to\nremain. We had a great meeting that night!\n\nAnother reminiscence may not be out of place. We were working for a\nprohibition amendment in the state of Pennsylvania, and the night\nbefore election I reached Coatesville. I had just completed six weeks of\nstrenuous campaigning, and that day I had already conducted and spoken\nat two big outdoor meetings. When I entered the town hall of Coatesville\nI found it filled with women. Only a few men were there; the rest were\ncelebrating and campaigning in the streets. So I arose and said:\n\n\"I would like to ask how many men there are in the audience who intend\nto vote for the amendment to-morrow?\"\n\nEvery man in the hall stood up.\n\n\"I thought so,\" I said. \"Now I intend to ask your indulgence. As you are\nall in favor of the amendment, there is no use in my setting its claims\nbefore you; and, as I am utterly exhausted, I suggest that we sing the\nDoxology and go home!\"\n\nThe audience saw the common sense of my position, so the people laughed\nand sang the Doxology and departed. As we were leaving the hall one of\nCoatesville's prominent citizens stopped me.\n\n\"I wish you were a man,\" he said. \"The town was to have a big outdoor\nmeeting to-night, and the orator has failed us. There are thousands of\nmen in the streets waiting for the speech, and the saloons are sending\nthem free drinks to get them drunk and carry the town to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"I'll talk to them if you wish.\"\n\n\"Great Scott!\" he gasped. \"I'd be afraid to let you. Something might\nhappen!\"\n\n\"If anything happens, it will be in a good cause,\" I reminded him. \"Let\nus go.\"\n\nDown-town we found the streets so packed with men that the cars could\nnot get through, and with the greatest difficulty we reached the stand\nwhich had been erected for the speaker. It was a gorgeous affair. There\nwere flaring torches all around it, and a \"bull's-eye,\" taken from the\nhead of a locomotive, made an especially brilliant patch of light.\nThe stand had been erected at a point where the city's four principal\nstreets meet, and as far as I could see there were solid masses of\ncitizens extending into these streets. A glee-club was doing its best\nto help things along, and the music of an organette, an instrument much\nused at the time in campaign rallies, swelled the joyful tumult. As\nI mounted the platform the crowd was singing \"Vote for Betty and the\nBaby,\" and I took that song for my text, speaking of the helplessness\nof women and children in the face of intemperance, and telling the crowd\nthe only hope of the Coatesville women lay in the vote cast by their men\nthe next day.\n\nDirectly in front of me stood a huge and extraordinarily\nrepellent-looking negro. A glance at him almost made one shudder, but\nbefore I had finished my first sentence he raised his right arm straight\nabove him and shouted, in a deep and wonderfully rich bass voice,\n\"Hallelujah to the Lamb!\" From that point on he punctuated my speech\nevery few moments with good, old-fashioned exclamations of salvation\nwhich helped to inspire the crowd. I spoke for almost an hour. Three\ntimes in my life, and only three times, I have made speeches that have\nsatisfied me to the degree, that is, of making me feel that at least I\nwas giving the best that was in me. The speech at Coatesville was one\nof those three. At the end of it the good-natured crowd cheered for ten\nminutes. The next day Coatesville voted for prohibition, and, rightly or\nwrongly, I have always believed that I helped to win that victory.\n\nHere, by the way, I may add that of the two other speeches which\nsatisfied me one was made in Chicago, during the World's Fair, in 1893,\nand the other in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1912. The International Council\nof Women, it will be remembered, met in Chicago during the Fair, and\nI was invited to preach the sermon at the Sunday-morning session. The\noccasion was a very important one, bringing together at least five\nthousand persons, including representative women from almost every\ncountry in Europe, and a large number of women ministers. These made an\nimpressive group, as they all wore their ministerial robes; and for the\nfirst time I preached in a ministerial robe, ordered especially for\nthat day. It was made of black crepe de Chine, with great double flowing\nsleeves, white silk undersleeves, and a wide white silk underfold down\nthe front; and I may mention casually that it looked very much better\nthan I felt, for I was very nervous. My father had come on to Chicago\nespecially to hear my sermon, and had been invited to sit on the\nplatform. Even yet he was not wholly reconciled to my public work, but\nhe was beginning to take a deep interest in it. I greatly desired to\nplease him and to satisfy Miss Anthony, who was extremely anxious that\non that day of all days I should do my best.\n\nI gave an unusual amount of time and thought to that sermon, and at last\nevolved what I modestly believed to be a good one. I never write out\na sermon in advance, but I did it this time, laboriously, and then\nmemorized the effort. The night before the sermon was to be delivered\nMiss Anthony asked me about it, and when I realized how deeply\ninterested she was I delivered it to her then and there as a rehearsal.\nIt was very late, and I knew we would not be interrupted. As she\nlistened her face grew longer and longer and her lips drooped at the\ncorners. Her disappointment was so obvious that I had difficulty in\nfinishing my recitation; but I finally got through it, though rather\nweakly toward the end, and waited to hear what she would say, hoping\nagainst hope that she had liked it better than she seemed to. But Susan\nB. Anthony was the frankest as well as the kindest of women. Resolutely\nshe shook her head.\n\n\"It's no good, Anna,\" she said; firmly. \"You'll have to do better.\nYou've polished and repolished that sermon until there's no life left in\nit. It's dead. Besides, I don't care for your text.\"\n\n\"Then give me a text,\" I demanded, gloomily.\n\n\"I can't,\" said Aunt Susan.\n\nI was tired and bitterly disappointed, and both conditions showed in my\nreply.\n\n\"Well,\" I asked, somberly, \"if you can't even supply a text, how do you\nsuppose I'm going to deliver a brand-new sermon at ten o'clock to-morrow\nmorning?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" declared Aunt Susan, blithely, \"you'll find a text.\"\n\nI suggested several, but she did not like them. At last I said, \"I have\nit--'Let no man take thy crown.'\"\n\n\"That's it!\" exclaimed Miss Anthony. \"Give us a good sermon on that\ntext.\"\n\nShe went to her room to sleep the sleep of the just and the untroubled,\nbut I tossed in my bed the rest of the night, planning the points of\nthe new sermon. After I had delivered it the next morning I went to my\nfather to assist him from the platform. He was trembling, and his eyes\nwere full of tears. He seized my arm and pressed it.\n\n\"Now I am ready to die,\" was all he said.\n\nI was so tired that I felt ready to die, too; but his satisfaction and a\nglance at Aunt Susan's contented face gave me the tonic I needed. Father\ndied two years later, and as I was campaigning in California I was not\nwith him at the end. It was a comfort to remember, however, that in the\ntwilight of his life he had learned to understand his most difficult\ndaughter, and to give her credit for earnestness of purpose, at least,\nin following the life that had led her away from him. After his death,\nand immediately upon my return from California, I visited my mother,\nand it was well indeed that I did, for within a few months she followed\nfather into the other world for which all of her unselfish life had been\na preparation.\n\nOur last days together were perfect. Her attitude was one of serene\nand cheerful expectancy, and I always think of her as sitting among the\nprimroses and bluebells she loved, which seemed to bloom unceasingly in\nthe windows of her room. I recall, too, with gratitude, a trifle which\ngave her a pleasure out of all proportion to what I had dreamed it\nwould do. She had expressed a longing for some English heather, \"not\nthe hot-house variety, but the kind that blooms on the hills,\" and I had\nsucceeded in getting a bunch for her by writing to an English friend.\n\nIts possession filled her with joy, and from the time it came until the\nday her eyes closed in their last sleep it was rarely beyond reach of\nher hand. At her request, when she was buried we laid the heather on her\nheart--the heart of a true and loyal woman, who, though her children had\nnot known it, must have longed without ceasing throughout her New World\nlife for the Old World of her youth.\n\nThe Scandinavian speech was an even more vital experience than the\nChicago one, for in Stockholm I delivered the first sermon ever preached\nby a woman in the State Church of Sweden, and the event was preceded\nby an amount of political and journalistic opposition which gave it an\ninternational importance. I had also been invited by the Norwegian\nwomen to preach in the State Church of Norway, but there we experienced\nobstacles. By the laws of Norway women are permitted to hold all public\noffices except those in the army, navy, and church--a rather remarkable\nmilitant and spiritual combination. As a woman, therefore, I was denied\nthe use of the church by the Minister of Church Affairs.\n\nThe decision created great excitement and much delving into the law.\nIt then appeared that if the use of a State Church is desired for a\nminister of a foreign country the government can give such permission.\nIt was thought that I might slip in through this loophole, and\napplication was made to the government. The reply came that permission\ncould be received only from the entire Cabinet; and while the Cabinet\ngentlemen were feverishly discussing the important issue, the Norwegian\npress became active, pointing out that the Minister of Church Affairs\nhad arrogantly assumed the right of the entire Cabinet in denying\nthe application. The charge was taken up by the party opposed to the\ngovernment party in Parliament, and the Minister of Church Affairs\nswiftly turned the whole matter over to his conferees.\n\nThe Cabinet held a session, and by a vote of four to three decided NOT\nto allow a woman to preach in the State Church. I am happy to add that\nof the three who voted favorably on the question one was the Premier of\nNorway. Again the newspapers grasped their opportunity--especially the\norgans of the opposition party. My rooms were filled with reporters,\nwhile daily the excitement grew. The question was brought up in\nParliament, and I was invited to attend and hear the discussion there.\nBy this time every newspaper in Scandinavia was for or against me; and\nthe result of the whole matter was that, though the State Church of\nNorway was not opened to me, a most unusual interest had been aroused in\nmy sermon in the State Church of Sweden. When I arrived there to keep\nmy engagement, not only was the wonderful structure packed to its walls,\nbut the waiting crowds in the street were so large that the police had\ndifficulty in opening a way for our party.\n\nI shall never forget my impression of the church itself when I entered\nit. It will always stand forth in my memory as one of the most beautiful\nchurches I have ever visited. On every side were monuments of dead\nheroes and statesmen, and the high, vaulted blue dome seemed like the\nopen sky above our heads. Over us lay a light like a soft twilight, and\nthe great congregation filled not only all the pews, but the aisles, the\nplatform, and even the steps of the pulpit. The ushers were young women\nfrom the University of Upsala, wearing white university caps with black\nvizors, and sashes in the university colors. The anthem was composed\nespecially for the occasion by the first woman cathedral organist in\nSweden--the organist of the cathedral in Gothenburg--and she had brought\nwith her thirty members of her choir, all of them remarkable singers.\n\nThe whole occasion was indescribably impressive, and I realized in\nevery fiber the necessity of being worthy of it. Also, I experienced\na sensation such as I had never known before, and which I can only\ndescribe as a seeming complete separation of my physical self from my\nspiritual self. It was as if my body stood aside and watched my soul\nenter that pulpit. There was no uncertainty, no nervousness, though\nusually I am very nervous when I begin to speak; and when I had finished\nI knew that I had done my best.\n\nBut all this is a long way from the early days I was discussing, when I\nwas making my first diffident bows to lecture audiences and learning the\nlessons of the pioneer in the lecture-field. I was soon to learn more,\nfor in 1888 Miss Anthony persuaded me to drop my temperance work\nand concentrate my energies on the suffrage cause. For a long time I\nhesitated. I was very happy in my connection with the Woman's Christian\nTemperance Union, and I knew that Miss Willard was depending on me to\ncontinue it. But Miss Anthony's arguments were irrefutable, and she was\nherself, as always, irresistible.\n\n\"You can't win two causes at once,\" she reminded me. \"You're merely\nscattering your energies. Begin at the beginning. Win suffrage for\nwomen, and the rest will follow.\" As an added argument, she took me with\nher on her Kansas campaign, and after that no further arguments were\nneeded. From then until her death, eighteen years later, Miss Anthony\nand I worked shoulder to shoulder.\n\nThe most interesting lecture episode of our first Kansas campaign was\nmy debate with Senator John J. Ingalls. Before this, however, on our\narrival at Atchison, Mrs. Ingalls gave a luncheon for Miss Anthony, and\nRachel Foster Avery and I were also invited. Miss Anthony sat at the\nright of Senator Ingalls, and I at his left, while Mrs. Ingalls, of\ncourse, adorned the opposite end of her table. Mrs. Avery and I had just\nbeen entertained for several days at the home of a vegetarian friend who\ndid not know how to cook vegetables, and we were both half starved. When\nwe were invited to the Ingalls home we had uttered in unison a joyous\ncry, \"Now we shall have something to eat!\" At the luncheon, however,\nSenator Ingalls kept Miss Anthony and me talking steadily. He was not in\nfavor of suffrage for women, but he wished to know all sorts of things\nabout the Cause, and we were anxious to have him know them. The result\nwas that I had time for only an occasional mouthful, while down at the\nend of the table Mrs. Avery ate and ate, pausing only to send me glances\nof heartfelt sympathy. Also, whenever she had an especially toothsome\nmorsel on the end of her fork she wickedly succeeded in catching my eye\nand thus adding the last sybaritic touch to her enjoyment.\n\nNotwithstanding the wealth of knowledge we had bestowed upon him, or\nperhaps because of it, the following night Senator Ingalls made his\nfamous speech against suffrage, and it fell to my lot to answer him. In\nthe course of his remarks he asked this question: \"Would you like to add\nthree million illiterate voters to the large body of illiterate voters\nwe have in America to-day?\" The audience applauded light-heartedly,\nbut I was disturbed by the sophistry of the question. One of Senator\nIngalls's most discussed personal peculiarities was the parting of his\nhair in the middle. Cartoonists and newspaper writers always made much\nof this, so when I rose to reply I felt justified in mentioning it.\n\n\"Senator Ingalls,\" I began, \"parts his hair in the middle, as we all\nknow, but he makes up for it by parting his figures on one side. Last\nnight he gave you the short side of his figures. At the present time\nthere are in the United States about eighteen million women of voting\nage. When the Senator asked whether you wanted three million additional\nilliterate women voters, he forgot to ask also if you didn't want\nfifteen million additional intelligent women voters! We will grant that\nit will take the votes of three million intelligent women to wipe out\nthe votes of three million illiterate women. But don't forget that that\nwould still leave us twelve million intelligent votes to the good!\"\n\nThe audience applauded as gaily as it had applauded Senator Ingalls when\nhe spoke on the other side, and I continued:\n\n\"Now women have always been generous to men. So of our twelve million\nintelligent voters we will offer four million to offset the votes of the\nfour million illiterate men in this country--and then we will still have\neight million intelligent votes to add to the other intelligent votes\nwhich are cast.\" The audience seemed to enjoy this.\n\n\"The anti-suffragists are fairly safe,\" I ended, \"as long as they remain\non the plane of prophecy. But as soon as they tackle mathematics they\nget into trouble!\"\n\nMiss Anthony was much pleased by the wide publicity given to this\ndebate, but Senator Ingalls failed to share her enthusiasm.\n\nIt was shortly after this encounter that I had two traveling experiences\nwhich nearly cost me my life. One of them occurred in Ohio at the time\nof a spring freshet. I know of no state that can cover itself with water\nas completely as Ohio can, and for no apparent reason. On this occasion\nit was breaking its own record. We had driven twenty miles across\ncountry in a buggy which was barely out of the water, and behind horses\nthat at times were almost forced to swim, and when we got near the town\nwhere I was to lecture, though still on the opposite side of the river\nfrom it, we discovered that the bridge was gone. We had a good view of\nthe town, situated high and dry on a steep bank; but the river which\nrolled between us and that town was a roaring, boiling stream, and the\nonly possible way to cross it, I found, was to walk over a railroad\ntrestle, already trembling under the force of the water.\n\nThere were hundreds of men on the river-bank watching the flood, and\nwhen they saw me start out on the empty trestle they set up a cheer that\nnearly threw me off. The river was wide and the ties far apart, and\nthe roar of the stream below was far from reassuring; but in some way I\nreached the other side, and was there helped off the trestle by what the\nnewspapers called \"strong and willing hands.\"\n\nAnother time, in a desperate resolve to meet a lecture engagement, I\nwalked across the railroad trestle at Elmira, New York, and when I was\nhalfway over I heard shouts of warning to turn back, as a train was\ncoming. The trestle was very high at that point, and I realized that if\nI turned and faced an oncoming train I would undoubtedly lose my nerve\nand fall. So I kept on, as rapidly as I could, accompanied by the\nshrieks of those who objected to witnessing a violent death, and I\nreached the end of the trestle just as an express-train thundered on the\nbeginning of it. The next instant a policeman had me by the shoulders\nand was shaking me as if I had been a bad child.\n\n\"If you ever do such a thing again,\" he thundered, \"I'll lock you up!\"\n\nAs soon as I could speak I assured him fervently that I never would; one\nsuch experience was all I desired.\n\nOccasionally a flash of humor, conscious or unconscious, lit up the\ngloom of a trying situation. Thus, in Parkersburg, West Virginia, the\ntrain I was on ran into a coal-car. I was sitting in a sleeper, leaning\nback comfortably with my feet on the seat in front of me, and the force\nof the collision lifted me up, turned me completely over, and deposited\nme, head first, two seats beyond. On every side I heard cries and\nthe crash of human bodies against unyielding substances as my\nfellow-passengers flew through the air, while high and clear above the\ntumult rang the voice of the conductor:\n\n\"Keep your seats!\" he yelled. \"KEEP YOUR SEATS!\"\n\nNobody in our car was seriously hurt; but, so great is the power of\nvested authority, no one smiled over that order but me.\n\nMany times my medical experience was useful. Once I was on a train which\nran into a buggy and killed the woman in it. Her little daughter, who\nwas with her, was badly hurt, and when the train had stopped the crew\nlifted the dead woman and the injured child on board, to take them to\nthe next station. As I was the only doctor among the passengers, the\nchild was turned over to me. I made up a bed on the seats and put the\nlittle patient there, but no woman in the car was able to assist me. The\ntragedy had made them hysterical, and on every side they were weeping\nand nerveless. The men were willing but inefficient, with the exception\nof one uncouth woodsman whose trousers were tucked into his boots and\nwhose hands were phenomenally big and awkward. But they were also very\ngentle, as I realized when he began to help me. I knew at once that\nhe was the man I needed, notwithstanding his unkempt hair, his general\nungainliness, the hat he wore on the back of his head, and the pink\ncarnation in his buttonhole, which, by its very incongruity, added the\nfinal accent to his unprepossessing appearance. Together we worked over\nthe child, making it as comfortable as we could. It was hardly necessary\nto tell my aide what I wanted done; he seemed to know and even to\nanticipate my efforts.\n\nWhen we reached the next station the dead woman was taken out and laid\non the platform, and a nurse and doctor who had been telegraphed for\nwere waiting to care for the little girl. She was conscious by this\ntime, and with the most exquisite gentleness my rustic Bayard lifted her\nin his arms to carry her off the train. Quite unnecessarily I motioned\nto him not to let her see her dead mother. He was not the sort who\nneeded that warning; he had already turned her face to his shoulder,\nand, with head bent low above her, was safely skirting the spot where\nthe long, covered figure lay.\n\nEvidently the station was his destination, too, for he remained there;\nbut just as the train pulled out he came hurrying to my window, took the\ncarnation from his buttonhole, and without a word handed it to me. And\nafter the tragic hour in which I had learned to know him the crushed\nflower, from that man, seemed the best fee I had ever received.\n\n\n\n\nIX. \"AUNT SUSAN\"\n\nIn The Life of Susan B. Anthony it is mentioned that 1888 was a year of\nspecial recognition of our great leader's work, but that it was also the\nyear in which many of her closest friends and strongest supporters were\ntaken from her by death. A. Bronson Alcott was among these, and Louisa\nM. Alcott, as well as Dr. Lozier; and special stress is laid on Miss\nAnthony's sense of loss in the diminishing circle of her friends--a loss\nwhich new friends and workers came forward, eager to supply.\n\n\"Chief among these,\" adds the record, \"was Anna Shaw, who, from the time\nof the International Council in '88, gave her truest allegiance to Miss\nAnthony.\"\n\nIt is true that from that year until Miss Anthony's death in 1906 we two\nwere rarely separated; and I never read the paragraph I have just\nquoted without seeing, as in a vision, the figure of \"Aunt Susan\" as she\nslipped into my hotel room in Chicago late one night after an evening\nmeeting of the International Council. I had gone to bed--indeed, I was\nalmost asleep when she came, for the day had been as exhausting as it\nwas interesting. But notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, \"Aunt\nSusan,\" then nearing seventy, was still as fresh and as full of\nenthusiasm as a young girl. She had a great deal to say, she declared,\nand she proceeded to say it--sitting in a big easy-chair near the bed,\nwith a rug around her knees, while I propped myself up with pillows and\nlistened.\n\nHours passed and the dawn peered wanly through the windows, but still\nMiss Anthony talked of the Cause always of the Cause--and of what we two\nmust do for it. The previous evening she had been too busy to eat any\ndinner, and I greatly doubt whether she had eaten any luncheon at noon.\nShe had been on her feet for hours at a time, and she had held numerous\ndiscussions with other women she wished to inspire to special effort.\nYet, after it all, here she was laying out our campaigns for years\nahead, foreseeing everything, forgetting nothing, and sweeping me with\nher in her flight toward our common goal, until I, who am not easily\ncarried off my feet, experienced an almost dizzy sense of exhilaration.\n\nSuddenly she stopped, looked at the gas-jets paling in the morning light\nthat filled the room, and for a fleeting instant seemed surprised. In\nthe next she had dismissed from her mind the realization that we had\ntalked all night. Why should we not talk all night? It was part of our\nwork. She threw off the enveloping rug and rose.\n\n\"I must dress now,\" she said, briskly. \"I've called a committee meeting\nbefore the morning session.\"\n\nOn her way to the door nature smote her with a rare reminder, but even\nthen she did not realize that it was personal. \"Perhaps,\" she remarked,\ntentatively, \"you ought to have a cup of coffee.\"\n\nThat was \"Aunt Susan.\" And in the eighteen years which followed I had\ndaily illustrations of her superiority to purely human weaknesses. To\nher the hardships we underwent later, in our Western campaigns for woman\nsuffrage, were as the airiest trifles. Like a true soldier, she could\nsnatch a moment of sleep or a mouthful of food where she found it, and\nif either was not forthcoming she did not miss it. To me she was an\nunceasing inspiration--the torch that illumined my life. We went through\nsome difficult years together--years when we fought hard for each inch\nof headway we gained--but I found full compensation for every effort in\nthe glory of working with her for the Cause that was first in both our\nhearts, and in the happiness of being her friend. Later I shall describe\nin more detail the suffrage campaigns and the National and International\ncouncils in which we took part; now it is of her I wish to write--of her\nbigness, her many-sidedness, her humor, her courage, her quickness, her\nsympathy, her understanding, her force, her supreme common-sense, her\nselflessness; in short, of the rare beauty of her nature as I learned to\nknow it.\n\nLike most great leaders, she took one's best work for granted, and was\nchary with her praise; and even when praise was given it usually came by\nindirect routes. I recall with amusement that the highest compliment she\never paid me in public involved her in a tangle from which, later, only\nher quick wit extricated her. We were lecturing in an especially pious\ntown which I shall call B----, and just before I went on the platform\nMiss Anthony remarked, peacefully:\n\n\"These people have always claimed that I am irreligious. They will not\naccept the fact that I am a Quaker--or, rather, they seem to think a\nQuaker is an infidel. I am glad you are a Methodist, for now they cannot\nclaim that we are not orthodox.\"\n\nShe was still enveloped in the comfort of this reflection when she\nintroduced me to our audience, and to impress my qualifications upon my\nhearers she made her introduction in these words:\n\n\"It is a pleasure to introduce Miss Shaw, who is a Methodist minister.\nAnd she is not only orthodox of the orthodox, but she is also my right\nbower!\"\n\nThere was a gasp from the pious audience, and then a roar of laughter\nfrom irreverent men, in which, I must confess, I light-heartedly joined.\nFor once in her life Miss Anthony lost her presence of mind; she did not\nknow how to meet the situation, for she had no idea what had caused the\nlaughter. It bubbled forth again and again during the evening, and\neach time Miss Anthony received the demonstration with the same air of\npuzzled surprise. When we had returned to our hotel rooms I explained\nthe matter to her. I do not remember now where I had acquired my own\nsinful knowledge, but that night I faced \"Aunt Susan\" from the pedestal\nof a sophisticated worldling.\n\n\"Don't you know what a right bower is?\" I demanded, sternly.\n\n\"Of course I do,\" insisted \"Aunt Susan.\" \"It's a right-hand man--the\nkind one can't do without.\"\n\n\"It is a card,\" I told her, firmly--\"a leading card in a game called\neuchre.\"\n\n\"Aunt Susan\" was dazed. \"I didn't know it had anything to do with\ncards,\" she mused, mournfully. \"What must they think of me?\"\n\nWhat they thought became quite evident. The newspapers made countless\njokes at our expense, and there were significant smiles on the faces in\nthe audience that awaited us the next night. When Miss Anthony walked\nupon the platform she at once proceeded to clear herself of the tacit\ncharge against her.\n\n\"When I came to your town,\" she began, cheerfully, \"I had been warned\nthat you were a very religious lot of people. I wanted to impress upon\nyou the fact that Miss Shaw and I are religious, too. But I admit that\nwhen I told you she was my right bower I did not know what a right bower\nwas. I have learned that, since last night.\"\n\nShe waited until the happy chortles of her hearers had subsided, and\nthen went on.\n\n\"It interests me very much, however,\" she concluded, \"to realize that\nevery one of you seemed to know all about a right bower, and that I had\nto come to your good, orthodox town to get the information.\"\n\nThat time the joke was on the audience. Miss Anthony's home was in\nRochester, New York, and it was said by our friends that on the rare\noccasions when we were not together, and I was lecturing independently,\n\"all return roads led through Rochester.\" I invariably found some excuse\nto go there and report to her. Together we must have worn out many\nRochester pavements, for \"Aunt Susan's\" pet recreation was walking,\nand she used to walk me round and round the city squares, far into the\nnight, and at a pace that made policemen gape at us as we flew by. Some\ndisrespectful youth once remarked that on these occasions we suggested a\nrace between a ruler and a rubber ball--for she was very tall and thin,\nwhile I am short and plump. To keep up with her I literally bounded at\nher side.\n\nA certain amount of independent lecturing was necessary for me, for I\nhad to earn my living. The National American Woman Suffrage\nAssociation has never paid salaries to its officers, so, when I became\nvice-president and eventually, in 1904, president of the association,\nI continued to work gratuitously for the Cause in these positions.\nEven Miss Anthony received not one penny of salary for all her years of\nunceasing labor, and she was so poor that she did not have a home of her\nown until she was seventy-five. Then it was a very simple one, and\nshe lived with the utmost economy. I decided that I could earn my bare\nexpenses by making one brief lecture tour each year, and I made an\narrangement with the Redpath Bureau which left me fully two-thirds of my\ntime for the suffrage work I loved.\n\nThis was one result of my all-night talk with Miss Anthony in Chicago,\nand it enabled me to carry out her plan that I should accompany her in\nmost of the campaigns in which she sought to arouse the West to the\nneed of suffrage for women. From that time on we traveled and lectured\ntogether so constantly that each of us developed an almost uncanny\nknowledge of the other's mental processes. At any point of either's\nlecture the other could pick it up and carry it on--a fortunate\ncondition, as it sometimes became necessary to do this. Miss Anthony\nwas subject to contractions of the throat, which for the moment caused\na slight strangulation. On such occasions--of which there were\nseveral--she would turn to me and indicate her helplessness. Then I\nwould repeat her last sentence, complete her speech, and afterward make\nmy own.\n\nThe first time this happened we were in Washington, and \"Aunt Susan\"\nstopped in the middle of a word. She could not speak; she merely\nmotioned to me to continue for her, and left the stage. At the end of\nthe evening a prominent Washington man who had been in our audience\nremarked to me, confidentially:\n\n\"That was a nice little play you and Miss Anthony made to-night--very\neffective indeed.\"\n\nFor an instant I did not catch his meaning, nor the implication in his\nknowing smile.\n\n\"Very clever, that strangling bit, and your going on with the speech,\"\nhe repeated. \"It hit the audience hard.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" I protested, \"you don't think it was a deliberate thing--that\nwe planned or rehearsed it.\"\n\nHe stared at me incredulously. \"Are you going to pretend,\" he demanded,\n\"that it wasn't a put-up job?\"\n\nI told him he had paid us a high compliment, and that we must really\nhave done very well if we had conveyed that impression; and I finally\nconvinced him that we not only had not rehearsed the episode, but that\nneither of us had known what the other meant to say. We never wrote out\nour speeches, but our subject was always suffrage or some ramification\nof suffrage, and, naturally, we had thoroughly digested each other's\nviews.\n\nIt is said by my friends that I write my speeches on the tips of my\nfingers--for I always make my points on my fingers and have my fingers\nnamed for points. When I plan a speech I decide how many points I wish\nto make and what those points shall be. My mental preparation follows.\nMiss Anthony's method was much the same; but very frequently both of us\nthrew over all our plans at the last moment and spoke extemporaneously\non some theme suggested by the atmosphere of the gathering or by the\nwords of another speaker.\n\nFrom Miss Anthony, more than from any one else, I learned to keep cool\nin the face of interruptions and of the small annoyances and disasters\ninevitable in campaigning. Often we were able to help each other out of\nembarrassing situations, and one incident of this kind occurred during\nour campaign in South Dakota. We were holding a meeting on the hottest\nSunday of the hottest month in the year--August--and hundreds of the\nnatives had driven twenty, thirty, and even forty miles across the\ncountry to hear us. We were to speak in a sod church, but it was\ndiscovered that the structure would not hold half the people who were\ntrying to enter it, so we decided that Miss Anthony should speak from\nthe door, in order that those both inside and outside might hear her. To\nelevate her above her audience, she was given an empty dry-goods box to\nstand on.\n\nThis makeshift platform was not large, and men, women, and children were\nseated on the ground around it, pressing up against it, as close to the\nspeaker as they could get. Directly in front of Miss Anthony sat a woman\nwith a child about two years old--a little boy; and this infant, like\nevery one else in the packed throng, was dripping with perspiration and\nsuffering acutely under the blazing sun. Every woman present seemed to\nhave brought children with her, doubtless because she could not leave\nthem alone at home; and babies were crying and fretting on all sides.\nThe infant nearest Miss Anthony fretted most strenuously; he was a\nsturdy little fellow with a fine pair of lungs, and he made it very\ndifficult for her to lift her voice above his dismal clamor. Suddenly,\nhowever, he discovered her feet on the drygoods box, about on a level\nwith his head. They were clad in black stockings and low shoes; they\nmoved about oddly; they fascinated him. With a yelp of interest he\ngrabbed for them and began pinching them to see what they were. His\nhowls ceased; he was happy.\n\nMiss Anthony was not. But it was a great relief to have the child quiet,\nso she bore the infliction of the pinching as long as she could. When\nendurance had found its limit she slipped back out of reach, and as his\nnew plaything receded the boy uttered shrieks of disapproval. There was\nonly one way to stop his noise; Miss Anthony brought her feet forward\nagain, and he resumed the pinching of her ankles, while his yelps\nsubsided to contented murmurs. The performance was repeated half a dozen\ntimes. Each time the ankles retreated the baby yelled. Finally, for once\nat the end of her patience, \"Aunt Susan\" leaned forward and addressed\nthe mother, whose facial expression throughout had shown a complete\nmental detachment from the situation.\n\n\"I think your little boy is hot and thirsty,\" she said, gently. \"If\nyou would take him out of the crowd and give him a drink of water and\nunfasten his clothes, I am sure he would be more comfortable.\" Before\nshe had finished speaking the woman had sprung to her feet and was\nfacing her with fierce indignation.\n\n\"This is the first time I have ever been insulted as a mother,\" she\ncried; \"and by an old maid at that!\" Then she grasped the infant and\nleft the scene, amid great confusion. The majority of those in the\naudience seemed to sympathize with her. They had not seen the episode of\nthe feet, and they thought Miss Anthony was complaining of the child's\ncrying. Their children were crying, too, and they felt that they had\nall been criticized. Other women rose and followed the irate mother, and\nmany men gallantly followed them. It seemed clear that motherhood had\nbeen outraged.\n\nMiss Anthony was greatly depressed by the episode, and she was not\ncomforted by a prediction one man made after the meeting.\n\n\"You've lost at least twenty votes by that little affair,\" he told her.\n\n\"Aunt Susan\" sighed. \"Well,\" she said, \"if those men knew how my ankles\nfelt I would have won twenty votes by enduring the torture as long as I\ndid.\"\n\nThe next day we had a second meeting. Miss Anthony made her speech early\nin the evening, and by the time it was my turn to begin all the children\nin the audience--and there were many--were both tired and sleepy. At\nleast half a dozen of them were crying, and I had to shout to make my\nvoice heard above their uproar. Miss Anthony remarked afterward that\nthere seemed to be a contest between me and the infants to see which\nof us could make more noise. The audience was plainly getting restless\nunder the combined effect, and finally a man in the rear rose and added\nhis voice to the tumult.\n\n\"Say, Miss Shaw,\" he yelled, \"don't you want these children put out?\"\n\nIt was our chance to remove the sad impression of yesterday, and I\ngrasped it.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" I yelled back. \"Nothing inspires me like the voice of a\nchild!\"\n\nA handsome round of applause from mothers and fathers greeted this noble\ndeclaration, after which the blessed babies and I resumed our joint\nvocal efforts. When the speech was finished and we were alone together,\nMiss Anthony put her arm around my shoulder and drew me to her side.\n\n\"Well, Anna,\" she said, gratefully, \"you've certainly evened us up on\nmotherhood this time.\"\n\nThat South Dakota campaign was one of the most difficult we ever made.\nIt extended over nine months; and it is impossible to describe the\npoverty which prevailed throughout the whole rural community of the\nState. There had been three consecutive years of drought. The sand was\nlike powder, so deep that the wheels of the wagons in which we rode\n\"across country\" sank half-way to the hubs; and in the midst of this dry\npowder lay withered tangles that had once been grass. Every one had the\nforsaken, desperate look worn by the pioneer who has reached the limit\nof his endurance, and the great stretches of prairie roads showed\ninnumerable canvas-covered wagons, drawn by starved horses, and followed\nby starved cows, on their way \"Back East.\" Our talks with the despairing\ndrivers of these wagons are among my most tragic memories. They had lost\neverything except what they had with them, and they were going East to\nleave \"the woman\" with her father and try to find work. Usually, with a\nlook of disgust at his wife, the man would say: \"I wanted to leave two\nyears ago, but the woman kept saying, 'Hold on a little longer.'\"\n\nBoth Miss Anthony and I gloried in the spirit of these pioneer women,\nand lost no opportunity to tell them so; for we realized what our nation\nowes to the patience and courage of such as they were. We often asked\nthem what was the hardest thing to bear in their pioneer life, and we\nusually received the same reply:\n\n\"To sit in our little adobe or sod houses at night and listen to the\nwolves howl over the graves of our babies. For the howl of the wolf is\nlike the cry of a child from the grave.\"\n\nMany days, and in all kinds of weather, we rode forty and fifty miles\nin uncovered wagons. Many nights we shared a one-room cabin with all\nthe members of the family. But the greatest hardship we suffered was the\nlack of water. There was very little good water in the state, and the\npurest water was so brackish that we could hardly drink it. The more we\ndrank the thirstier we became, and when the water was made into tea it\ntasted worse than when it was clear. A bath was the rarest of luxuries.\nThe only available fuel was buffalo manure, of which the odor permeated\nall our food. But despite these handicaps we were happy in our work, for\nwe had some great meetings and many wonderful experiences.\n\nWhen we reached the Black Hills we had more of this genuine campaigning.\nWe traveled over the mountains in wagons, behind teams of horses,\nvisiting the mining-camps; and often the gullies were so deep that when\nour horses got into them it was almost impossible to get them out. I\nrecall with special clearness one ride from Hill City to Custer City. It\nwas only a matter of thirty miles, but it was thoroughly exhausting; and\nafter our meeting that same night we had to drive forty miles farther\nover the mountains to get the early morning train from Buffalo Gap.\nThe trail from Custer City to Buffalo Gap was the one the animals had\noriginally made in their journeys over the pass, and the drive in\nthat wild region, throughout a cold, piercing October night, was an\nunforgetable experience. Our host at Custer City lent Miss Anthony his\nbig buffalo overcoat, and his wife lent hers to me. They also heated\nblocks of wood for our feet, and with these protections we started. A\nfull moon hung in the sky. The trees were covered with hoar-frost, and\nthe cold, still air seemed to sparkle in the brilliant light. Again Miss\nAnthony talked to me throughout the night--of the work, always of the\nwork, and of what it would mean to the women who followed us; and again\nshe fired my soul with the flame that burned so steadily in her own.\n\nIt was daylight when we reached the little station at Buffalo Gap where\nwe were to take the train. This was not due, however, for half an hour,\nand even then it did not come. The station was only large enough to hold\nthe stove, the ticket-office, and the inevitable cuspidor. There was\nbarely room in which to walk between these and the wall. Miss Anthony\nsat down on the floor. I had a few raisins in my bag, and we divided\nthem for breakfast. An hour passed, and another, and still the train\ndid not come. Miss Anthony, her back braced against the wall, buried her\nface in her hands and dropped into a peaceful abyss of slumber, while I\nwalked restlessly up and down the platform. The train arrived four hours\nlate, and when eventually we had reached our destination we learned\nthat the ministers of the town had persuaded the women to give up the\nsuffrage meeting scheduled for that night, as it was Sunday.\n\nThis disappointment, following our all-day and all-night drive to keep\nour appointment, aroused Miss Anthony's fighting spirit. She sent me out\nto rent the theater for the evening, and to have some hand-bills printed\nand distributed, announcing that we would speak. At three o'clock she\nmade the concession to her seventy years of lying down for an hour's\nrest. I was young and vigorous, so I trotted around town to get\nsomebody to preside, somebody to introduce us, somebody to take up the\ncollection, and somebody who would provide music--in short, to make all\nour preparations for the night meeting.\n\nWhen evening came the crowd which had assembled was so great that men\nand women sat in the windows and on the stage, and stood in the flies.\nNight attractions were rare in that Dakota town, and here was something\nnew. Nobody went to church, so the churches were forced to close. We had\na glorious meeting. Both Miss Anthony and I were in excellent fighting\ntrim, and Miss Anthony remarked that the only thing lacking to make me\ndo my best was a sick headache. The collection we took up paid all\nour expenses, the church singers sang for us, the great audience was\ninterested, and the whole occasion was an inspiring success.\n\nThe meeting ended about half after ten o'clock, and I remember taking\nMiss Anthony to our hotel and escorting her to her room. I also remember\nthat she followed me to the door and made some laughing remark as I left\nfor my own room; but I recall nothing more until the next morning when\nshe stood beside me telling me it was time for breakfast. She had found\nme lying on the cover of my bed, fully clothed even to my bonnet and\nshoes. I had fallen there, utterly exhausted, when I entered my room the\nnight before, and I do not think I had even moved from that time until\nthe moment--nine hours later--when I heard her voice and felt her hand\non my shoulder.\n\nAfter all our work, we did not win Dakota that year, but Miss Anthony\nbore the disappointment with the serenity she always showed. To her a\nfailure was merely another opportunity, and I mention our experience\nhere only to show of what she was capable in her gallant seventies. But\nI should misrepresent her if I did not show her human and sentimental\nside as well. With all her detachment from human needs she had emotional\nmoments, and of these the most satisfying came when she was listening\nto music. She knew nothing whatever about music, but was deeply moved by\nit; and I remember vividly one occasion when Nordica sang for her, at an\nafternoon reception given by a Chicago friend in \"Aunt Susan's\" honor.\nAs it happened, she had never heard Nordica sing until that day; and\nbefore the music began the great artiste and the great leader met, and\nin the moment of meeting became friends. When Nordica sang, half an hour\nlater, she sang directly to Miss Anthony, looking into her eyes; and\n\"Aunt Susan\" listened with her own eyes full of tears. When the last\nnotes had been sung she went to the singer and put both arms around her.\nThe music had carried her back to her girlhood and to the sentiment of\nsixteen.\n\n\"Oh, Nordica,\" she sighed, \"I could die listening to such singing!\"\n\nAnother example of her unquenchable youth has also a Chicago setting.\nDuring the World's Fair a certain clergyman made an especially violent\nstand in favor of closing the Fair grounds on Sunday. Miss Anthony took\nissue with him.\n\n\"If I had charge of a young man in Chicago at this time,\" she told the\nclergyman, \"I would much rather have him locked inside the Fair grounds\non Sunday or any other day than have him going about on the outside.\"\n\nThe clergyman was horrified. \"Would you like to have a son of yours go\nto Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show on Sunday?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Of course I would,\" admitted Miss Anthony. \"In fact, I think he would\nlearn more there than from the sermons preached in some churches.\"\n\nLater this remark was repeated to Colonel Cody (\"Buffalo Bill\"), who,\nof course, was delighted with it. He at once wrote to Miss Anthony,\nthanking her for the breadth of her views, and offering her a box for\nhis \"Show.\" She had no strong desire to see the performance, but some of\nus urged her to accept the invitation and to take us with her. She was\nalways ready to do anything that would give us pleasure, so she promised\nthat we should go the next afternoon. Others heard of the jaunt and\nbegged to go also, and Miss Anthony blithely took every applicant under\nher wing, with the result that when we arrived at the box-office the\nnext day there were twelve of us in the group. When she presented her\nnote and asked for a box, the local manager looked doubtfully at the\ndelegation.\n\n\"A box only holds six,\" he objected, logically. Miss Anthony, who had\ngiven no thought to that slight detail, looked us over and smiled her\nseraphic smile.\n\n\"Why, in that case,\" she said, cheerfully, \"you'll have to give us two\nboxes, won't you?\"\n\nThe amused manager decided that he would, and handed her the tickets;\nand she led her band to their places in triumph. When the performance\nbegan Colonel Cody, as was his custom, entered the arena from the far\nend of the building, riding his wonderful horse and bathed, of course,\nin the effulgence of his faithful spot-light. He rode directly to our\nboxes, reined his horse in front of Miss Anthony, rose in his stirrups,\nand with his characteristic gesture swept his slouch-hat to his\nsaddle-bow in salutation. \"Aunt Susan\" immediately rose, bowed in\nher turn and, for the moment as enthusiastic as a girl, waved her\nhandkerchief at him, while the big audience, catching the spirit of the\nscene, wildly applauded. It was a striking picture this meeting of the\npioneer man and woman; and, poor as I am, I would give a hundred dollars\nfor a snapshot of it.\n\nOn many occasions I saw instances of Miss Anthony's prescience--and\none of these was connected with the death of Frances E. Willard. \"Aunt\nSusan\" had called on Miss Willard, and, coming to me from the sick-room,\nhad walked the floor, beating her hands together as she talked of the\nvisit.\n\n\"Frances Willard is dying,\" she exclaimed, passionately. \"She is dying,\nand she doesn't know it, and no one around her realizes it. She is lying\nthere, seeing into two worlds, and making more plans than a thousand\nwomen could carry out in ten years. Her brain is wonderful. She has the\nmost extraordinary clearness of vision. There should be a stenographer\nin that room, and every word she utters should be taken down, for every\nword is golden. But they don't understand. They can't realize that she\nis going. I told Anna Gordon the truth, but she won't believe it.\"\n\nMiss Willard died a few days later, with a suddenness which seemed to be\na terrible shock to those around her.\n\nOf \"Aunt Susan's\" really remarkable lack of selfconsciousness we who\nworked close to her had a thousand extraordinary examples. Once, I\nremember, at the New Orleans Convention, she reached the hall a little\nlate, and as she entered the great audience already assembled gave her\na tremendous reception. The exercises of the day had not yet begun, and\nMiss Anthony stopped short and looked around for an explanation of the\noutburst. It never for a moment occurred to her that the tribute was to\nher.\n\n\"What has happened, Anna?\" she asked at last.\n\n\"You happened, Aunt Susan,\" I had to explain.\n\nAgain, on the great \"College Night\" of the Baltimore Convention,\nwhen President M. Carey Thomas of Bryn Mawr College had finished her\nwonderful tribute to Miss Anthony, the audience, carried away by the\nspeech and also by the presence of the venerable leader on the platform,\nbroke into a whirlwind of applause. In this \"Aunt Susan\" artlessly\njoined, clapping her hands as hard as she could. \"This is all for you,\nAunt Susan,\" I whispered, \"so it isn't your time to applaud.\"\n\n\"Aunt Susan\" continued to clap. \"Nonsense,\" she said, briskly. \"It's not\nfor me. It's for the Cause--the Cause!\"\n\nMiss Anthony told me in 1904 that she regarded her reception in Berlin,\nduring the meeting of the International Council of Women that year, as\nthe climax of her career. She said it after the unexpected and\nwonderful ovation she had received from the German people, and certainly\nthroughout her inspiring life nothing had happened that moved her more\ndeeply.\n\nFor some time Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, of whose splendid work for the\nCause I shall later have more to say, had cherished the plan of forming\nan International Suffrage Alliance. She believed the time had come when\nthe suffragists of the entire world could meet to their common benefit;\nand Miss Anthony, always Mrs. Catt's devoted friend and admirer, agreed\nwith her. A committee was appointed to meet in Berlin in 1904, just\nbefore the meeting of the International Council of Women, and Miss\nAnthony was appointed chairman of the committee. At first the plan of\nthe committee was not welcomed by the International Council; there was\neven a suspicion that its purpose was to start a rival organization.\nBut it met, a constitution was framed, and officers were elected, Mrs.\nCatt--the ideal choice for the place--being made president. As a climax\nto the organization, a great public mass-meeting had been arranged by\nthe German suffragists, but at the special plea of the president of the\nInternational Council Miss Anthony remained away from this meeting. It\nwas represented to her that the interests of the Council might suffer if\nshe and other of its leading speakers were also leaders in the suffrage\nmovement. In the interest of harmony, there fore, she followed the\nwishes of the Council's president--to my great unhappiness and to that\nof other suffragists.\n\nWhen the meeting was opened the first words of the presiding officer\nwere, \"Where is Susan B. Anthony?\" and the demonstration that followed\nthe question was the most unexpected and overwhelming incident of the\ngathering. The entire audience rose, men jumped on their chairs, and the\ncheering continued without a break for ten minutes. Every second of that\ntime I seemed to see Miss Anthony, alone in her hotel room, longing with\nall her big heart to be with us, as we longed to have her. I prayed that\nthe loss of a tribute which would have meant so much might be made up\nto her, and it was. Afterward, when we burst in upon her and told her\nof the great demonstration the mere mention of her name had caused, her\nlips quivered and her brave old eyes filled with tears. As we looked at\nher I think we all realized anew that what the world called stoicism\nin Susan B. Anthony throughout the years of her long struggle had been,\ninstead, the splendid courage of an indomitable soul--while all the time\nthe woman's heart had longed for affection and recognition. The next\nmorning the leading Berlin newspaper, in reporting the debate and\ndescribing the spontaneous tribute to Miss Anthony, closed with these\nsentences: \"The Americans call her 'Aunt Susan.' She is our 'Aunt\nSusan,' too!\"\n\nThroughout the remainder of Miss Anthony's visit she was the most\nhonored figure at the International Council. Every time she entered the\ngreat convention-hall the entire audience rose and remained standing\nuntil she was seated; each mention of her name was punctuated by cheers;\nand the enthusiasm when she appeared on the platform to say a few words\nwas beyond bounds. When the Empress of Germany gave her reception to the\nofficers of the Council, she crowned the hospitality of her people in a\ncharacteristically gracious way. As soon as Miss Anthony was presented\nto her the Empress invited her to be seated, and to remain seated,\nalthough every one else, including the august lady herself, was\nstanding. A little later, seeing the intrepid warrior of eighty-four\non her feet with the other delegates, the Empress sent one of her aides\nacross the room with this message: \"Please tell my friend Miss Anthony\nthat I especially wish her to be seated. We must not let her grow\nweary.\"\n\nIn her turn, Miss Anthony was fascinated by the Empress. She could not\nkeep her eyes off that charming royal lady. Probably the thing that most\nimpressed her was the ability of her Majesty as a linguist. Receiving\nwomen from every civilized country on the globe, the Empress seemed to\naddress each in her own tongue-slipping from one language into the next\nas easily as from one topic to another.\n\n\"And here I am,\" mourned \"Aunt Susan,\" \"speaking only one language, and\nthat not very well.\"\n\nAt this Berlin quinquennial, by the way, I preached the Council sermon,\nand the occasion gained a certain interest from the fact that I was the\nfirst ordained woman to preach in a church in Germany. It then took on\na tinge of humor from the additional fact that, according to the\nGerman law, as suddenly revealed to us by the police, no clergyman was\npermitted to preach unless clothed in clerical robes in the pulpit. It\nhappened that I had not taken my clerical robes with me--I am constantly\nforgetting those clerical robes!--so the pastor of the church kindly\noffered me his robes.\n\nNow the pastor was six feet tall and broad in proportion, and I, as I\nhave already confessed, am very short. His robes transformed me into\nsuch an absurd caricature of a preacher that it was quite impossible for\nme to wear them. What, then, were we to do? Lacking clerical robes, the\npolice would not allow me to utter six words. It was finally decided\nthat the clergyman should meet the letter of the law by entering the\npulpit in his robes and standing by my side while I delivered my sermon.\nThe law soberly accepted this solution of the problem, and we offered\nthe congregation the extraordinary tableau of a pulpit combining a large\nand impressive pastor standing silently beside a small and inwardly\nconvulsed woman who had all she could do to deliver her sermon with the\nsolemnity the occasion required.\n\nAt this same conference I made one of the few friendships I enjoy with\na member of a European royal family, for I met the Princess Blank of\nItaly, who overwhelmed me with attention during my visit, and from whom\nI still receive charming letters. She invited me to visit her in her\ncastle in Italy, and to accompany her to her mother's castle in Austria,\nand she finally insisted on knowing exactly why I persistently refused\nboth invitations.\n\n\"Because, my dear Princess,\" I explained, \"I am a working-woman.\"\n\n\"Nobody need KNOW that,\" murmured the Princess, calmly.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" I assured her, \"it is the first thing I should\nexplain.\"\n\n\"But why?\" the Princess wanted to know.\n\nI studied her in silence for a moment. She was a new and interesting\ntype to me, and I was glad to exchange viewpoints with her.\n\n\"You are proud of your family, are you not?\" I asked. \"You are proud of\nyour great line?\"\n\nThe Princess drew herself up. \"Assuredly,\" she said.\n\n\"Very well,\" I continued. \"I am proud, too. What I have done I have done\nunaided, and, to be frank with you, I rather approve of it. My work is\nmy patent of nobility, and I am not willing to associate with those from\nwhom it would have to be concealed or with those who would look down\nupon it.\"\n\nThe Princess sighed. I was a new type to her, too, as new as she was to\nme; but I had the advantage of her, for I could understand her point\nof view, whereas she apparently could not follow mine. She was very\ngracious to me, however, showing me kindness and friendship in a dozen\nways, giving me an immense amount of her time and taking rather more of\nmy time than I could spare, but never forgetting for a moment that her\nblood was among the oldest in Europe, and that all her traditions were\nin keeping with its honorable age.\n\nAfter the Berlin meeting Miss Anthony and I were invited to spend a\nweek-end at the home of Mrs. Jacob Bright, that \"Aunt Susan\" might renew\nher acquaintance with Annie Besant. This visit is among my most vivid\nmemories. Originally \"Aunt Susan\" had greatly admired Mrs. Besant,\nand had openly lamented the latter's concentration on theosophical\ninterests--when, as Miss Anthony put it, \"there are so many live\nproblems here in this world.\" Now she could not conceal her disapproval\nof the \"other-worldliness\" of Mrs. Besant, Mrs. Bright, and her\ndaughter. Some remarkable and, to me, most amusing discussions took\nplace among the three; but often, during Mrs. Besant's most sustained\noratorical flights, Miss Anthony's interest would wander, and she would\ndrop a remark that showed she had not heard a word. She had a great\nadmiration for Mrs. Besant's intellect; but she disapproved of her\nflowing and picturesque white robes, of her bare feet, of her incessant\ncigarette-smoking; above all, of her views. At last, one day.{sic} the\nclimax of the discussions came.\n\n\"Annie,\" demanded \"Aunt Susan,\" \"why don't you make that aura of\nyours do its gallivanting in this world, looking up the needs of the\noppressed, and investigating the causes of present wrongs? Then you\ncould reveal to us workers just what we should do to put things right,\nand we could be about it.\"\n\nMrs. Besant sighed and said that life was short and aeons were long,\nand that while every one would be perfected some time, it was useless to\ndeal with individuals here.\n\n\"But, Annie!\" exclaimed Miss Anthony, pathetically. \"We ARE here! Our\nbusiness is here! It's our duty to do what we can here.\"\n\nMrs. Besant seemed not to hear her. She was in a trance, gazing into the\naeons.\n\n\"I'd rather have one year of your ability, backed up with common sense,\nfor the work of making this world better,\" cried the exasperated \"Aunt\nSusan,\" \"than a million aeons in the hereafter!\"\n\nMrs. Besant sighed again. It was plain that she could not bring herself\nback from the other world, so Miss Anthony, perforce, accompanied her to\nit.\n\n\"When your aura goes visiting in the other world,\" she asked, curiously,\n\"does it ever meet your old friend Charles Bradlaugh?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" declared Mrs. Besant. \"Frequently.\"\n\n\"Wasn't he very much surprised,\" demanded Miss Anthony, with growing\ninterest, \"to discover that he was not dead?\"\n\nMrs. Besant did not seem to know what emotion Mr. Bradlaugh had\nexperienced when that revelation came.\n\n\"Well,\" mused \"Aunt Susan,\" \"I should think he would have been\nsurprised. He was so certain he was going to be dead that it must have\nbeen astounding to discover he wasn't. What was he doing in the other\nworld?\"\n\nMrs. Besant heaved a deeper sigh. \"I am very much discouraged over Mr.\nBradlaugh,\" she admitted, wanly. \"He is hovering too near this world.\nHe cannot seem to get away from his mundane interests. He is as much\nconcerned with parliamentary affairs now as when he was on this plane.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said Miss Anthony; \"that's the most sensible thing I've heard\nyet about the other world. It encourages me. I've always felt sure that\nif I entered the other life before women were enfranchised nothing in\nthe glories of heaven would interest me so much as the work for women's\nfreedom on earth. Now,\" she ended, \"I shall be like Mr. Bradlaugh. I\nshall hover round and continue my work here.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Besant had left the room Mrs. Bright felt that it was her duty\nto admonish \"Aunt Susan\" to be more careful in what she said.\n\n\"You are making too light of her creed,\" she expostulated. \"You do not\nrealize the important position Mrs. Besant holds. Why, in India, when\nshe walks from her home to her school all those she meets prostrate\nthemselves. Even the learned men prostrate themselves and put their\nfaces on the ground as she goes by.\"\n\n\"Aunt Susan's\" voice, when she replied, took on the tones of one who is\nsorely tried. \"But why in Heaven's name does any sensible Englishwoman\nwant a lot of heathen to prostrate themselves as she goes up the\nstreet?\" she demanded, wearily. \"It's the most foolish thing I ever\nheard.\"\n\nThe effort to win Miss Anthony over to the theosophical doctrine was\nabandoned. That night, after we had gone to our rooms, \"Aunt Susan\"\nsummed up her conclusions on the interview:\n\n\"It's a good thing for the world,\" she declared, \"that some of us don't\nknow so much. And it's a better thing for this world that some of us\nthink a little earthly common sense is more valuable than too much\nheavenly knowledge.\"\n\n\n\n\nX. THE PASSING OF \"AUNT SUSAN\"\n\n\nOn one occasion Miss Anthony had the doubtful pleasure of reading her\nown obituary notices, and her interest in them was characteristically\nnaive. She had made a speech at Lakeside, Ohio, during which, for the\nfirst time in her long experience, she fainted on the platform. I was\nnot with her at the time, and in the excitement following her collapse\nit was rumored that she had died. Immediately the news was telegraphed\nto the Associated Press of New York, and from there flashed over the\ncountry. At Miss Anthony's home in Rochester a reporter rang the bell\nand abruptly informed her sister, Miss Mary Anthony, who came to the\ndoor, that \"Aunt Susan\" was dead. Fortunately Miss Mary had a cool head.\n\n\"I think,\" she said, \"that if my sister had died I would have heard\nabout it. Please have your editors telegraph to Lakeside.\"\n\nThe reporter departed, but came back an hour later to say that his\nnewspaper had sent the telegram and the reply was that Susan B. Anthony\nwas dead.\n\n\"I have just received a better telegram than that,\" remarked Mary\nAnthony. \"Mine is from my sister; she tells me that she fainted\nto-night, but soon recovered and will be home to-morrow.\"\n\nNevertheless, the next morning the American newspapers gave much\nspace to Miss Anthony's obituary notices, and \"Aunt Susan\" spent some\ninteresting hours reading them. One that pleased her vastly was printed\nin the Wichita Eagle, whose editor, Mr. Murdock, had been almost her\nbitterest opponent. He had often exhausted his brilliant vocabulary in\neditorial denunciations of suffrage and suffragists, and Miss Anthony\nhad been the special target of his scorn. But the news of her death\nseemed to be a bitter blow to him; and of all the tributes the\nAmerican press gave to Susan B. Anthony dead, few equaled in beauty and\nappreciation the one penned by Mr. Murdock and published in the Eagle.\nHe must have been amused when, a few days later, he received a letter\nfrom \"Aunt Susan\" herself, thanking him warmly for his changed opinion\nof her and hoping that it meant the conversion of his soul to our Cause.\nIt did not, and Mr. Murdock, though never again quite as bitter as he\nhad been, soon resumed the free editorial expression of his antisuffrage\nsentiments. Times have changed, however, and to-day his son, now a\nmember of Congress, is one of our strongest supporters in that body.\n\nIn 1905 it became plain that Miss Anthony's health was failing. Her\nvisits to Germany and England the previous year, triumphant though they\nhad been, had also proved a drain on her vitality; and soon after her\nreturn to America she entered upon a task which helped to exhaust her\nremaining strength. She had been deeply interested in securing a fund of\n$50,000 to enable women to enter Rochester University, and, one morning,\njust after we had held a session of our executive committee in her\nRochester home, she read a newspaper announcement to the effect that\nat four o'clock that afternoon the opportunity to admit women to the\nuniversity would expire, as the full fifty thousand dollars had not been\nraised. The sum of eight thousand dollars was still lacking.\n\nWith characteristic energy, Miss Anthony undertook to save the situation\nby raising this amount within the time limit. Rushing to the telephone,\nshe called a cab and prepared to go forth on her difficult quest; but\nfirst, while she was putting on her hat and coat, she insisted that her\nsister, Mary Anthony, should start the fund by contributing one thousand\ndollars from her meager savings, and this Miss Mary did. \"Aunt Susan\"\nmade every second count that day, and by half after three o'clock\nshe had secured the necessary pledges. Several of the trustees of the\nuniversity, however, had not seemed especially anxious to have the\nfund raised, and at the last moment they objected to one pledge for a\nthousand dollars, on the ground that the man who had given it was very\nold and might die before the time set to pay it; then his family, they\nfeared, might repudiate the obligation. Without a word Miss Anthony\nseized the pledge and wrote her name across it as an indorsement. \"I am\ngood for it,\" she then said, quietly, \"if the gentleman who signed it is\nnot.\"\n\nThat afternoon she returned home greatly fatigued. A few hours later the\ngirl students who had been waiting admission to the university came to\nserenade her in recognition of her successful work for them, but she\nwas too ill to see them. She was passing through the first stage of what\nproved to be her final breakdown.\n\nIn 1906, when the date of the annual convention of the National American\nWoman Suffrage Association in Baltimore was drawing near, she became\nconvinced that it would be her last convention. She was right. She\nshowed a passionate eagerness to make it one of the greatest conventions\never held in the history of the movement; and we, who loved her and saw\nthat the flame of her life was burning low, also bent all our energies\nto the task of realizing her hopes. In November preceding the convention\nshe visited me and her niece, Miss Lucy Anthony, in our home in\nMount Airy, Philadelphia, and it was clear that her anxiety over the\nconvention was weighing heavily upon her. She visibly lost strength from\nday to day. One morning she said abruptly, \"Anna, let's go and call on\nPresident M. Carey Thomas, of Bryn Mawr.\"\n\nI wrote a note to Miss Thomas, telling her of Miss Anthony's desire to\nsee her, and received an immediate reply inviting us to luncheon the\nfollowing day. We found Miss Thomas deep in the work connected with her\nnew college buildings, over which she showed us with much pride. Miss\nAnthony, of course, gloried in the splendid results Miss Thomas had\nachieved, but she was, for her, strangely silent and preoccupied. At\nluncheon she said:\n\n\"Miss Thomas, your buildings are beautiful; your new library is a\nmarvel; but they are not the cause of our presence here.\"\n\n\"No,\" Miss Thomas said; \"I know you have something on your mind. I am\nwaiting for you to tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"We want your co-operation, and that of Miss Garrett,\" began Miss\nAnthony, promptly, \"to make our Baltimore Convention a success. We want\nyou to persuade the Arundel Club of Baltimore, the most fashionable club\nin the city, to give a reception to the delegates; and we want you to\narrange a college night on the programme--a great college night, with\nthe best college speakers ever brought together.\"\n\nThese were large commissions for two extremely busy women, but both\nMiss Thomas and Miss Garrett--realizing Miss Anthony's intense\nearnestness--promised to think over the suggestions and see what they\ncould do. The next morning we received a telegram from them stating that\nMiss Thomas would arrange the college evening, and that Miss Garrett\nwould reopen her Baltimore home, which she had closed, during the\nconvention. She also invited Miss Anthony and me to be her guests there,\nand added that she would try to arrange the reception by the Arundel\nClub.\n\n\"Aunt Susan\" was overjoyed. I have never seen her happier than she was\nover the receipt of that telegram. She knew that whatever Miss Thomas\nand Miss Garrett undertook would be accomplished, and she rightly\nregarded the success of the convention as already assured. Her\nexpectations were more than realized. The college evening was\nundoubtedly the most brilliant occasion of its kind ever arranged for a\nconvention. President Ira Remsen of Johns Hopkins University presided,\nand addresses were made by President Mary E. Woolley of Mount Holyoke,\nProfessor Lucy Salmon of Vassar, Professor Mary Jordan of Smith,\nPresident Thomas herself, and many others.\n\nFrom beginning to end the convention was probably the most notable yet\nheld in our history. Julia Ward Howe and her daughter, Florence Howe\nHall, were also guests of Miss Garrett, who, moreover, entertained all\nthe speakers of \"College Night.\" Miss Anthony, now eighty-six, arrived\nin Baltimore quite ill, and Mrs. Howe, who was ninety, was taken ill\nsoon after she reached there. The two great women made a dramatic\nexchange on the programme, for on the first night, when Miss Anthony was\nunable to speak, Mrs. Howe took her place, and on the second night,\nwhen Mrs. Howe had succumbed, Miss Anthony had recovered sufficiently\nto appear for her. Clara Barton was also an honored figure at the\nconvention, and Miss Anthony's joy in the presence of all these old and\ndear friends was overflowing. With them, too, were the younger women,\nready to take up and carry on the work the old leaders were laying down;\nand \"Aunt Susan,\" as she surveyed them all, felt like a general whose\nsuperb army is passing in review before him. At the close of the college\nprogramme, when the final address had been made by Miss Thomas, Miss\nAnthony rose and in a few words expressed her feeling that her life-work\nwas done, and her consciousness of the near approach of the end. After\nthat night she was unable to appear, and was indeed so ill that she\nwas confined to her bed in Miss Garrett's most hospitable home. Nothing\ncould have been more thoughtful or more beautiful than the care Miss\nGarrett and Miss Thomas bestowed on her. They engaged for her one of the\nbest physicians in Baltimore, who, in turn, consulted with the leading\nspecialists of Johns Hopkins, and they also secured a trained nurse.\nThis final attention required special tact, for Miss Anthony's fear of\n\"giving trouble\" was so great that she was not willing to have a nurse.\nThe nurse, therefore, wore a housemaid's uniform, and \"Aunt Susan\"\nremained wholly unconscious that she was being cared for by one of the\nbest nurses in the famous hospital.\n\nBetween sessions of the convention I used to sit by \"Aunt Susan's\" bed\nand tell her what was going on. She was triumphant over the immense\nsuccess of the convention, but it was clear that she was still worrying\nover the details of future work. One day at luncheon Miss Thomas asked\nme, casually:\n\n\"By the way, how do you raise the money to carry on your work?\"\n\nWhen I told her the work was wholly dependent on voluntary contributions\nand on the services of those who were willing to give themselves\ngratuitously to it, Miss Thomas was greatly surprised. She and Miss\nGarrett asked a number of practical questions, and at the end of our\ntalk they looked at each other.\n\n\"I don't think,\" said Miss Thomas, \"that we have quite done our duty in\nthis matter.\"\n\nThe next day they invited a number of us to dinner, to again discuss\nthe situation; and they admitted that they had sat up throughout the\nprevious night, talking the matter over and trying to find some way to\nhelp us. They had also discussed the situation with Miss Anthony, to\nher vast content, and had finally decided that they would try to raise\na fund of $60,000, to be paid in yearly instalments of $12,000 for five\nyears--part of these annual instalments to be used as salaries for the\nactive officers. The mere mention of so large a fund startled us all.\nWe feared that it could not possibly be raised. But Miss Anthony plainly\nbelieved that now the last great wish of her life had been granted.\nShe was convinced that Miss Thomas and Miss Garrett could accomplish\nanything--even the miracle of raising $60,000 for the suffrage\ncause--and they did, though \"Aunt Susan\" was not here to glory over the\nresult when they had achieved it.\n\nOn the 15th of February we left Baltimore for Washington, where Miss\nAnthony was to celebrate her eighty-sixth birthday. For many years\nthe National American Woman Suffrage Association had celebrated our\nbirthdays together, as hers came on the 15th of the month and mine on\nthe 14th. There had been an especially festive banquet when she was\nseventy-four and I was forty-seven, and our friends had decorated the\ntable with floral \"4's\" and \"7's\"--the centerpiece representing \"74\"\nduring the first half of the banquet, and \"47\" the latter half. This\ntime \"Aunt Susan\" should not have attempted the Washington celebration,\nfor she was still ill and exhausted by the strain of the convention. But\nnotwithstanding her sufferings and the warnings of her physicians, she\ninsisted on being present; so Miss Garrett sent the trained nurse to\nWashington with her, and we all tried to make the journey the least\npossible strain on the patient's vitality.\n\nOn our arrival in Washington we went to the Shoreham, where, as always,\nthe proprietor took pains to give Miss Anthony a room with a view of the\nWashington monument, which she greatly admired. When I entered her room\na little later I found her standing at a window, holding herself up with\nhands braced against the casement on either side, and so absorbed in the\nview that she did not hear my approach. When I spoke to her she answered\nwithout turning her head.\n\n\"That,\" she said, softly, \"is the most beautiful monument in the world.\"\n\nI stood by her side, and together we looked at it in silence I realizing\nwith a sick heart that \"Aunt Susan\" knew she was seeing it for the last\ntime.\n\nThe birthday celebration that followed our executive meeting was an\nimpressive one. It was held in the Church of Our Father, whose pastor,\nthe Rev. John Van Schaick, had always been exceedingly kind to Miss\nAnthony. Many prominent men spoke. President Roosevelt and other\nstatesmen sent most friendly letters, and William H. Taft had promised\nto be present. He did not come, nor did he, then or later, send any\nexcuse for not coming--an omission that greatly disappointed Miss\nAnthony, who had always admired him. I presided at the meeting, and\nthough we all did our best to make it gay, a strange hush hung over\nthe assemblage a solemn stillness, such as one feels in the presence\nof death. We became more and more conscious that Miss Anthony was\nsuffering, and we hastened the exercises all we could. When I read\nPresident Roosevelt's long tribute to her, Miss Anthony rose to comment\non it.\n\n\"One word from President Roosevelt in his message to Congress,\" she\nsaid, a little wearily, \"would be worth a thousand eulogies of Susan\nB. Anthony. When will men learn that what we ask is not praise, but\njustice?\"\n\nAt the close of the meeting, realizing how weak she was, I begged her\nto let me speak for her. But she again rose, rested her hand on my\nshoulder, and, standing by my side, uttered the last words she ever\nspoke in public, pleading with women to consecrate themselves to the\nCause, assuring them that no power could prevent its ultimate success,\nbut reminding them also that the time of its coming would depend wholly\non their work and their loyalty. She ended with three words--very\nfitting words from her lips, expressing as they did the spirit of her\nlife-work--\"FAILURE IS IMPOSSIBLE.\"\n\nThe next morning she was taken to her home in Rochester, and one month\nfrom that day we conducted her funeral services. The nurse who had\naccompanied her from Baltimore remained with her until two others had\nbeen secured to take her place, and every care that love or medical\nscience could suggest was lavished on the patient. But from the first\nit was plain that, as she herself had foretold, \"Aunt Susan's\" soul was\nmerely waiting for the hour of its passing.\n\nOne of her characteristic traits was a dislike to being seen, even by\nthose nearest to her, when she was not well. During the first three\nweeks of her last illness, therefore, I did what she wished me to do--I\ncontinued our work, trying to do hers as well as my own. But all the\ntime my heart was in her sick-room, and at last the day came when I\ncould no longer remain away from her. I had awakened in the morning with\na strong conviction that she needed me, and at the breakfast-table I\nannounced to her niece, Miss Lucy Anthony, the friend who for years has\nshared my home, that I was going at once to \"Aunt Susan.\"\n\n\"I shall not even wait to telegraph,\" I declared. \"I am sure she has\nsent for me; I shall take the first train.\"\n\nThe journey brought me very close to death. As we were approaching\nWilkes-Barre our train ran into a wagon loaded with powder and dynamite,\nwhich had been left on the track. The horses attached to it had been\nunhitched by their driver, who had spent his time in this effort, when\nhe saw the train coming, instead of in signaling to the engineer. I was\non my way to the dining-car when the collision occurred, and, with every\none else who happened to be standing, I was hurled to the floor by the\nimpact; flash after flash of blinding light outside, accompanied by\na terrific roar, added to the panic of the passengers. When the train\nstopped we learned how narrow had been our escape from an especially\nunpleasant form of death. The dynamite in the wagon was frozen, and\ntherefore had not exploded; it was the explosion of the powder that had\ncaused the flashes and the din. The dark-green cars were burned almost\nwhite, and as we stood staring at them, a silent, stunned group, our\nconductor said, quietly, \"You will never be as near death again, and\nescape, as you have been to-day.\"\n\nThe accident caused a long delay, and it was ten o'clock at night when\nI reached Rochester and Miss Anthony's home. As I entered the house Miss\nMary Anthony rose in surprise to greet me.\n\n\"How did you get here so soon?\" she cried. And then: \"We sent for you\nthis afternoon. Susan has been asking for you all day.\"\n\nWhen I reached my friend's bedside one glance at her face showed me the\nend was near; and from that time until it came, almost a week later, I\nremained with her; while again, as always, she talked of the Cause, and\nof the life-work she must now lay down. The first thing she spoke of was\nher will, which she had made several years before, and in which she\nhad left the small property she possessed to her sister Mary, her niece\nLucy, and myself, with instructions as to the use we three were to\nmake of it. Now she told me we were to pay no attention to these\ninstructions, but to give every dollar of her money to the $60,000\nfund Miss Thomas and Miss Garrett were trying to raise. She was vitally\ninterested in this fund, as its success meant that for five years the\nactive officers of the National American Woman Suffrage Association,\nincluding myself as president, would for the first time receive salaries\nfor our work. When she had given her instructions on this point she\nstill seemed depressed.\n\n\"I wish I could live on,\" she said, wistfully. \"But I cannot. My spirit\nis eager and my heart is as young as it ever was, but my poor old body\nis worn out. Before I go I want you to give me a promise: Promise me\nthat you will keep the presidency of the association as long as you are\nwell enough to do the work.\"\n\n\"But how can I promise that?\" I asked. \"I can keep it only as long as\nothers wish me to keep it.\"\n\n\"Promise to make them wish you to keep it,\" she urged. \"Just as I wish\nyou to keep it.\"\n\nI would have promised her anything then. So, though I knew that to hold\nthe presidency would tie me to a position that brought in no living\nincome, and though for several years past I had already drawn alarmingly\nupon my small financial reserve, I promised her that I would hold the\noffice as long as the majority of the women in the association wished\nme to do so. \"But,\" I added, \"if the time comes when I believe that some\none else can do better work in the presidency than I, then let me feel\nat liberty to resign it.\"\n\nThis did not satisfy her.\n\n\"No, no,\" she objected. \"You cannot be the judge of that. Promise me\nyou will remain until the friends you most trust tell you it is time to\nwithdraw, or make you understand that it is time. Promise me that.\"\n\nI made the promise. She seemed content, and again began to talk of the\nfuture.\n\n\"You will not have an easy path,\" she warned me. \"In some ways it will\nbe harder for you than it has ever been for me. I was so much older than\nthe rest of you, and I had been president so long, that you girls have\nall been willing to listen to me. It will be different with you. Other\nwomen of your own age have been in the work almost as long as you have\nbeen; you do not stand out from them by age or length of service, as I\ndid. There will be inevitable jealousies and misunderstandings; there\nwill be all sorts of criticism and misrepresentation. My last word\nto you is this: No matter what is done or is not done, how you are\ncriticized or misunderstood, or what efforts are made to block your\npath, remember that the only fear you need have is the fear of not\nstanding by the thing you believe to be right. Take your stand and hold\nit; then let come what will, and receive blows like a good soldier.\"\n\nI was too much overcome to answer her; and after a moment of silence\nshe, in her turn, made me a promise.\n\n\"I do not know anything about what comes to us after this life ends,\"\nshe said. \"But if there is a continuance of life beyond it, and if I\nhave any conscious knowledge of this world and of what you are doing, I\nshall not be far away from you; and in times of need I will help you all\nI can. Who knows? Perhaps I may be able to do more for the Cause after I\nam gone than while I am here.\"\n\nNine years have passed since then, and in each day of them all it seems\nto me, in looking back, I have had some occasion to recall her words.\nWhen they were uttered I did not fully comprehend all they meant, or the\nclearness of the vision that had suggested them. It seemed to me that\nno position I could hold would be of sufficient importance to attract\njealousy or personal attacks. The years have brought more wisdom; I have\nlearned that any one who assumes leadership, or who, like myself, has\nhad leadership forced upon her, must expect to bear many things of which\nthe world knows nothing. But with this knowledge, too, has come the\nmemory of \"Aunt Susan's\" last promise, and again and yet again in\nhours of discouragement and despair I have been helped by the blessed\nconviction that she was keeping it.\n\nDuring the last forty-eight hours of her life she was unwilling that I\nshould leave her side. So day and night I knelt by her bed, holding her\nhand and watching the flame of her wonderful spirit grow dim. At times,\neven then, it blazed up with startling suddenness. On the last afternoon\nof her life, when she had lain quiet for hours, she suddenly began to\nutter the names of the women who had worked with her, as if in a final\nroll-call. Many of them had preceded her into the next world; others\nwere still splendidly active in the work she was laying down. But young\nor old, living or dead, they all seemed to file past her dying eyes that\nday in an endless, shadowy review, and as they went by she spoke to each\nof them.\n\nNot all the names she mentioned were known in suffrage ranks; some of\nthese women lived only in the heart of Susan B. Anthony, and now, for\nthe last time, she was thanking them for what they had done. Here was\none who, at a moment of special need, had given her small savings; here\nwas another who had won valuable recruits to the Cause; this one had\nwritten a strong editorial; that one had made a stirring speech. In\nthese final hours it seemed that not a single sacrifice or service,\nhowever small, had been forgotten by the dying leader. Last of all,\nshe spoke to the women who had been on her board and had stood by her\nloyally so long--Rachel Foster Avery, Alice Stone Blackwell, Carrie\nChapman Catt, Mrs. Upton, Laura Clay, and others. Then, after lying in\nsilence for a long time with her cheek on my hand, she murmured: \"They\nare still passing before me--face after face, hundreds and hundreds of\nthem, representing all the efforts of fifty years. I know how hard they\nhave worked I know the sacrifices they have made. But it has all been\nworth while!\"\n\nJust before she lapsed into unconsciousness she seemed restless and\nanxious to say something, searching my face with her dimming eyes.\n\n\"Do you want me to repeat my promise?\" I asked, for she had already made\nme do so several times. She made a sign of assent, and I gave her the\nassurance she desired. As I did so she raised my hand to her lips and\nkissed it--her last conscious action. For more than thirty hours after\nthat I knelt by her side, but though she clung to my hand until her own\nhand grew cold, she did not speak again.\n\nShe had told me over and over how much our long friendship and\nassociation had meant to her, and the comfort I had given her. But\nwhatever I may have been to her, it was as nothing compared with what\nshe was to me. Kneeling close to her as she passed away, I knew that\nI would have given her a dozen lives had I had them, and endured\na thousand times more hardship than we had borne together, for the\ninspiration of her companionship and the joy of her affection. They were\nthe greatest blessings I have had in all my life, and I cherish as my\ndearest treasure the volume of her History of Woman Suffrage on the\nfly-leaf of which she had written this inscription:\n\n\nREVEREND ANNA HOWARD SHAW:\n\nThis huge volume IV I present to you with the love that a mother\nbeareth, and I hope you will find in it the facts about women, for you\nwill find them nowhere else. Your part will be to see that the four\nvolumes are duly placed in the libraries of the country, where every\nstudent of history may have access to them.\n\nWith unbounded love and faith,\n\nSUSAN B. ANTHONY.\n\n\nThat final line is still my greatest comfort. When I am misrepresented\nor misunderstood, when I am accused of personal ambition or of working\nfor personal ends, I turn to it and to similar lines penned by the same\nhand, and tell myself that I should not allow anything to interfere with\nthe serenity of my spirit or to disturb me in my work. At the end of\neighteen years of the most intimate companionship, the leader of\nour Cause, the greatest woman I have ever known, still felt for me\n\"unbounded love and faith.\" Having had that, I have had enough.\n\nFor two days after \"Aunt Susan's\" death she lay in her own home, as if\nin restful slumber, her face wearing its most exquisite look of peaceful\nserenity; and here her special friends, the poor and the unfortunate of\nthe city, came by hundreds to pay their last respects. On the third\nday there was a public funeral, held in the Congregational church,\nand, though a wild blizzard was raging, every one in Rochester seemed\nincluded in the great throng of mourners who came to her bier in\nreverence and left it in tears. The church services were conducted\nby the pastor, the Rev. C. C. Albertson, a lifelong friend of Miss\nAnthony's, assisted by the Rev. William C. Gannett. James G. Potter,\nthe Mayor of the city, and Dr. Rush Rhees, president of Rochester\nUniversity, occupied prominent places among the distinguished mourners,\nand Mrs. Jerome Jeffries, the head of a colored school, spoke in behalf\nof the negro race and its recognition of Miss Anthony's services.\nCollege clubs, medical societies, and reform groups were represented by\ndelegates sent from different states, and Miss Anna Gordon had come on\nfrom Illinois to represent the Woman's National Christian Temperance\nUnion. Mrs. Catt delivered a eulogy in which she expressed the love\nand recognition of the organized suffrage women of the world for Miss\nAnthony, as the one to whom they had all looked as their leader. William\nLloyd Garrison spoke of Miss Anthony's work with his father and other\nantislavery leaders, and Mrs. Jean Brooks Greenleaf spoke in behalf\nof the New York State Suffrage Association. Then, as \"Aunt Susan\" had\nrequested, I made the closing address. She had asked me to do this and\nto pronounce the benediction, as well as to say the final words at her\ngrave.\n\nIt was estimated that more than ten thousand persons were assembled\nin and around the church, and after the benediction those who had been\npatiently waiting out in the storm were permitted to pass inside in\nsingle file for a last look at their friend. They found the coffin\ncovered by a large American flag, on which lay a wreath of laurel and\npalms; around it stood a guard of honor composed of girl students of\nRochester University in their college caps and gowns. All day students\nhad mounted guard, relieving one another at intervals. On every side\nthere were flowers and floral emblems sent by various organizations, and\njust over \"Aunt Susan's\" head floated the silk flag given to her by the\nwomen of Colorado. It contained four gold stars, representing the four\nenfranchised states, while the other stars were in silver. On her breast\nwas pinned the jeweled flag given to her on her eightieth birthday\nby the women of Wyoming--the first place in the world where in the\nconstitution of the state women were given equal political rights with\nmen. Here the four stars representing the enfranchised states were\nmade of diamonds, the others of silver enamel. Just before the lid was\nfastened on the coffin this flag was removed and handed to Mary Anthony,\nwho presented it to me. From that day I have worn it on every occasion\nof importance to our Cause, and each time a state is won for woman\nsuffrage I have added a new diamond star. At the time I write this--in\n1914--there are twelve.\n\nAs the funeral procession went through the streets of Rochester it was\nseen that all the city flags were at half-mast, by order of the City\nCouncil. Many houses were draped in black, and the grief of the citizens\nmanifested itself on every side. All the way to Mount Hope Cemetery\nthe snow whirled blindingly around us, while the masses that had fallen\ncovered the earth as far as we could see a fitting winding-sheet for\nthe one who had gone. Under the fir-trees around her open grave I obeyed\n\"Aunt Susan's\" wish that I should utter the last words spoken over her\nbody as she was laid to rest:\n\n\"Dear friend,\" I said, \"thou hast tarried with us long. Now thou hast\ngone to thy well-earned rest. We beseech the Infinite Spirit Who has\nupheld thee to make us worthy to follow in thy steps and to carry on thy\nwork. Hail and farewell.\"\n\n\n\n\nXI. THE WIDENING SUFFRAGE STREAM\n\nIn my chapters on Miss Anthony I bridged the twenty years between 1886\nand 1906, omitting many of the stirring suffrage events of that\nlong period, in my desire to concentrate on those which most vitally\nconcerned her. I must now retrace my steps along the widening suffrage\nstream and describe, consecutively at least, and as fully as these\nincomplete reminiscences will permit, other incidents that occurred on\nits banks.\n\nOf these the most important was the union in 1889 of the two great\nsuffrage societies--the American Association, of which Lucy Stone was\nthe president, and the National Association, headed by Susan B. Anthony\nand Elizabeth Cady Stanton. At a convention held in Washington\nthese societies were merged as The National American Woman Suffrage\nAssociation--the name our association still bears--and Mrs. Stanton was\nelected president. She was then nearly eighty and past active work, but\nshe made a wonderful presiding officer at our subsequent meetings, and\nshe was as picturesque as she was efficient.\n\nMiss Anthony, who had an immense admiration for her and a great personal\npride in her, always escorted her to the capital, and, having worked\nher utmost to make the meeting a success, invariably gave Mrs. Stanton\ncredit for all that was accomplished. She often said that Mrs. Stanton\nwas the brains of the new association, while she herself was merely its\nhands and feet; but in truth the two women worked marvelously together,\nfor Mrs. Stanton was a master of words and could write and speak to\nperfection of the things Susan B. Anthony saw and felt but could not\nherself express. Usually Miss Anthony went to Mrs. Stanton's house and\ntook charge of it while she stimulated the venerable president to the\nwriting of her annual address. Then, at the subsequent convention, she\nwould listen to the report with as much delight and pleasure as if each\nword of it had been new to her. Even after Mrs. Stanton's resignation\nfrom the presidency--at the end, I think, of three years--and Miss\nAnthony's election as her successor, \"Aunt Susan\" still went to her\nold friend whenever an important resolution was to be written, and Mrs.\nStanton loyally drafted it for her.\n\nMrs. Stanton was the most brilliant conversationalist I have ever known;\nand the best talk I have heard anywhere was that to which I used to\nlisten in the home of Mrs. Eliza Wright Osborne, in Auburn, New York,\nwhen Mrs. Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Emily Howland, Elizabeth Smith\nMiller, Ida Husted Harper, Miss Mills, and I were gathered there for\nour occasional week-end visits. Mrs. Osborne inherited her suffrage\nsympathies, for she was the daughter of Martha Wright, who, with Mrs.\nStanton and Lucretia Mott, called the first suffrage convention in\nSeneca Falls, New York. I must add in passing that her son, Thomas Mott\nOsborne, who is doing such admirable work in prison reform at Sing Sing,\nhas shown himself worthy of the gifted and high-minded mother who gave\nhim to the world.\n\nMost of the conversation in Mrs. Osborne's home was contributed by Mrs.\nStanton and Miss Anthony, while the rest of us sat, as it were, at their\nfeet. Many human and feminine touches brightened the lofty discussions\nthat were constantly going on, and the varied characteristics of our\nleaders cropped up in amusing fashion. Mrs. Stanton, for example, was\nrarely accurate in giving figures or dates, while Miss Anthony was\nalways very exact in such matters. She frequently corrected Mrs.\nStanton's statements, and Mrs. Stanton usually took the interruption\nin the best possible spirit, promptly admitting that \"Aunt Susan\" knew\nbest. On one occasion I recall, however, she held fast to her opinion\nthat she was right as to the month in which a certain incident had\noccurred.\n\n\"No, Susan,\" she insisted, \"you're wrong for once. I remember perfectly\nwhen that happened, for it was at the time I was beginning to wean\nHarriet.\"\n\nAunt Susan, though somewhat staggered by the force of this testimony,\nstill maintained that Mrs. Stanton must be mistaken, whereupon the\nlatter repeated, in exasperation, \"I tell you it happened when I was\nweaning Harriet.\" And she added, scornfully, \"What event have you got to\nreckon from?\"\n\nMiss Anthony meekly subsided.\n\nMrs. Stanton had wonderful blue eyes, which held to the end of her life\nan expression of eternal youth. During our conventions she usually took\na little nap in the afternoon, and when she awoke her blue eyes always\nhad an expression of pleased and innocent surprise, as if she were\ngazing on the world for the first time--the round, unwinking, interested\nlook a baby's eyes have when something attractive is held up before\nthem.\n\nLet me give in a paragraph, before I swing off into the bypaths that\nalways allure me, the consecutive suffrage events of the past quarter\nof a century. Having done this, I can dwell on each as casually as I\nchoose, for it is possible to describe only a few incidents here and\nthere; and I shall not be departing from the story of my life, for my\nlife had become merged in the suffrage cause.\n\nOf the preliminary suffrage campaigns in Kansas, made in company with\n\"Aunt Susan,\" I have already written, and it remains only to say that\nduring the second Kansas campaign yellow was adopted as the suffrage\ncolor. In 1890, '92, and '93 we again worked in Kansas and in South\nDakota, with such indefatigable and brilliant speakers as Mrs. Catt (to\nwhose efforts also were largely due the winning of Colorado in '93),\nMrs. Laura Johns of Kansas, Mrs. Julia Nelson, Henry B. Blackwell, Dr.\nHelen V. Putnam of Dakota, Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe, Rev. Olympia Browne of\nWisconsin, and Dr. Mary Seymour Howell of New York. In '94, '95, and '96\nspecial efforts were devoted to Idaho, Utah, California, and Washington,\nand from then on our campaigns were waged steadily in the Western\nstates.\n\nThe Colorado victory gave us two full suffrage states, for in 1869\nthe Territory of Wyoming had enfranchised women under very interesting\nconditions, not now generally remembered. The achievement was due to\nthe influence of one woman, Esther Morris, a pioneer who was as good a\nneighbor as she was a suffragist. In those early days, in homes far from\nphysicians and surgeons, the women cared for one another in sickness,\nand Esther Morris, as it happened, once took full and skilful charge\nof a neighbor during the difficult birth of the latter's child. She had\ndone the same thing for many other women, but this woman's husband was\nespecially grateful. He was also a member of the Legislature, and he\ntold Mrs. Morris that if there was any measure she wished put through\nfor the women of the territory he would be glad to introduce it. She\nimmediately took him at his word by asking him to introduce a bill\nenfranchising women, and he promptly did so.\n\nThe Legislature was Democratic, and it pounced upon the measure as a\nhuge joke. With the amiable purpose of embarrassing the Governor of the\nterritory, who was a Republican and had been appointed by the President,\nthe members passed the bill and put it up to him to veto. To their\ncombined horror and amazement, the young Governor did nothing of the\nkind. He had come, as it happened, from Salem, Ohio, one of the first\ntowns in the United States in which a suffrage convention was held.\nThere, as a boy, he had heard Susan B. Anthony make a speech, and he had\ncarried into the years the impression it made upon him. He signed that\nbill; and, as the Legislature could not get a two-thirds vote to kill it,\nthe disgusted members had to make the best of the matter. The following\nyear a Democrat introduced a bill to repeal the measure, but already\npublic sentiment had changed and he was laughed down. After that no\nfurther effort was ever made to take the ballot away from the women of\nWyoming.\n\nWhen the territory applied for statehood, it was feared that the\nwoman-suffrage clause in the constitution might injure its chance of\nadmission, and the women sent this telegram to Joseph M. Carey:\n\n\"Drop us if you must. We can trust the men of Wyoming to enfranchise us\nafter our territory becomes a state.\"\n\nMr. Carey discussed this telegram with the other men who were urging\nupon Congress the admission of their territory, and the following reply\nwent back:\n\n\"We may stay out of the Union a hundred years, but we will come in with\nour women.\"\n\nThere is great inspiration in those two messages--and a great lesson, as\nwell.\n\nIn 1894 we conducted a campaign in New York, when an effort was made to\nsecure a clause to enfranchise women in the new state constitution; and\nfor the first time in the history of the woman-suffrage movement many of\nthe influential women in the state and city of New York took an active\npart in the work. Miss Anthony was, as always, our leader and greatest\ninspiration. Mrs. John Brooks Greenleaf was state president, and Miss\nMary Anthony was the most active worker in the Rochester headquarters.\nMrs. Lily Devereaux Blake had charge of the campaign in New York City,\nand Mrs. Marianna Chapman looked after the Brooklyn section, while a\nmost stimulating sign of the times was the organization of a committee\nof New York women of wealth and social influence, who established their\nheadquarters at Sherry's. Among these were Mrs. Josephine Shaw Lowell,\nMrs. Joseph H. Choate, Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, Mrs. J. Warren Goddard,\nand Mrs. Robert Abbe. Miss Anthony, then in her seventy-fifth year,\nspoke in every county of the state sixty in all. I spoke in forty, and\nMrs. Catt, as always, made a superb record. Miss Harriet May Mills, a\ngraduate of Cornell, and Miss Mary G. Hay, did admirable organization\nwork in the different counties. Our disappointment over the result was\ngreatly soothed by the fact that only two years later both Idaho and\nUtah swung into line as full suffrage states, though California, in\nwhich we had labored with equal zeal, waited fifteen years longer.\n\nAmong these campaigns, and overlapping them, were our annual\nconventions--each of which I attended from 1888 on--and the national\nand international councils, to a number of which, also, I have given\npreliminary mention. When Susan B. Anthony died in 1906, four American\nstates had granted suffrage to woman. At the time I write--1914--the\nresult of the American women's work for suffrage may be briefly\ntabulated thus:\n\n     SUFFRAGE STATUS\n\n     FULL SUFFRAGE FOR WOMEN\n\n                                     Number of\n     State           Year Won    Electoral Votes\n     Wyoming         1869             3\n     Colorado        1893             6\n     Idaho           1896             4\n     Utah            1896             4\n     Washington      1910             7\n     California      1911            13\n     Arizona         1912             3\n     Kansas          1912            10\n     Oregon          1912             5\n     Alaska          1913            --\n     Nevada          1914             3\n     Montana         1914             4\n\n\n     PRESIDENTIAL AND MUNICIPAL SUFFRAGE FOR WOMEN\n                                     Number of\n     State           Year Won    Electoral Votes\n\n     Illinois        1913            29\n\n\n     STATES WHERE AMENDMENT HAS PASSED ONE LEGISLATURE AND\n     MUST PASS ANOTHER\n\n                                                     Number Goes to\n     State           House       Senate  Voters      Electoral Votes\n     Iowa            81-26       31-15   1916            13\n     Massachusetts   169-39      34-2    1915            18\n     New Jersey      49-4        15-3    1915            14\n     New York        125-5       40-2    1915            45\n     North Dakota    77-29       31-19   1916             5\n     Pennsylvania    131-70      26-22   1915            38\n\n\n\n     To tabulate the wonderful work done by the\n     conventions and councils is not possible, but a con\n     secutive list of the meetings would run like this:\n\n\n     First National Convention, Washington, D.C., 1887.\n     First International Council of Women, Washington, D.C., 1888.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D.C., 1889.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D.C., 1890.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D.C., 1891.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D.C., 1892.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D.C., 1893.\n     International Council, Chicago, 1893.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D.C., 1894.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Atlanta, Ga., 1895.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D.C., 1896.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Des Moines, Iowa, 1897.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D.C., 1898.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Grand Rapids, Mich., 1899.\n     International Council, London, England, 1899.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D.C., 1900.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Minneapolis, Minn., 1901.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D.C., 1902.\n     National Suffrage Convention, New Orleans, La., 1903.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D.C., 1904.\n     International Council of Women, Berlin, Germany, 1904.\n     Formation of Intern'l Suffrage Alliance, Berlin, Germany, 1904.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Portland, Oregon, 1905.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Baltimore, Md., 1906.\n     International Suffrage Alliance, Copenhagen, Denmark, 1906.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Chicago, III., 1907.\n     International Suffrage Alliance, Amsterdam, Holland, 1908.\n     National Suffrage Convention, Buffalo, N.

I have set forth the record baldly and without comment,\nbecause the bare facts are far more eloquent than words. It must not be\nforgotten, too, that these great achievements of the progressive women\nof to-day have been accomplished against the opposition of a large\nnumber of their own sex--who, while they are out in the world's arena\nfighting against progress for their sisters, still shatter the ear-drum\nwith their incongruous war-cry, \"Woman's place is in the home!\"\n here: We were attending the Republican state nominating convention at\nMitchell--Miss Anthony, Mrs. Catt, other leaders, and myself--having\nbeen told that it would be at once the largest and the most interesting\ngathering ever held in the state as it proved to be. All the leading\npoliticians of the state were there, and in the wake of the white men\nhad come tribes of Indians with their camp outfits, their wives and\ntheir children--the groups forming a picturesque circle of tents and\ntepees around the town. It was a great occasion for them, an Indian\npowwow, for by the law all Indians who had lands in severalty were to be\npermitted to vote the following year. They were present, therefore, to\nstudy the ways of the white man, and an edifying exhibition of these was\npromptly offered them.\n\nThe crowd was so great that it was only through the courtesy of Major\nPickler, a member of Congress and a devoted believer in suffrage, that\nMiss Anthony, Mrs. Catt, and the rest of us were able to secure passes\nto the convention, and when we reached the hall we were escorted to the\nlast row of seats on the crowded platform. As the space between us and\nthe speakers was filled by rows upon rows of men, as well as by the band\nand their instruments, we could see very little that took place. Some of\nour friends pointed out this condition to the local committee and asked\nthat we be given seats on the floor, but received the reply that\nthere was \"absolutely no room on the floor except for delegates and\ndistinguished visitors.\" Our persistent friends then suggested that at\nleast a front seat should be given to Miss Anthony, who certainly\ncame under the head of a \"distinguished visitor\"; but this was not\ndone--probably because a large number of the best seats were filled by\nRussian laborers wearing badges inscribed \"Against Woman Suffrage and\nSusan B. Anthony.\" We remained, perforce, in our rear seats, finding\nsuch interest as we could in the back view of hundreds of heads.\n\nJust before the convention was called to order it was announced that a\ndelegation of influential Indians was waiting outside, and a motion\nto invite the red men into the hall was made and carried with great\nenthusiasm. A committee of leading citizens was appointed to act as\nescort, and these gentlemen filed out, returning a few moments later\nwith a party of Indian warriors in full war regalia, even to their\ngay blankets, their feathered head-dresses, and their paint. When they\nappeared the band struck up a stirring march of welcome, and the entire\naudience cheered while the Indians, flanked by the admiring committee,\nstalked solemnly down the aisle and were given seats of honor directly\nin front of the platform.\n\nAll we could see of them were the brilliant feathers of their\nwar-bonnets, but we got the full effect of their reception in the music\nand the cheers. I dared not look at Miss Anthony during this remarkable\nscene, and she, craning her venerable neck to get a glimpse of the\nincident from her obscure corner, made no comment to me; but I knew what\nshe was thinking. The following year these Indians would have votes.\nCourtesy, therefore, must be shown them. But the women did not matter,\nthe politicians reasoned, for even if they were enfranchised they would\nnever support the element represented at that convention. It was not\nsurprising that, notwithstanding our hard work, we did not win the\nstate, though all the conditions had seemed most favorable; for the\nstate was new, the men and women were working side by side in the\nfields, and there was discontent in the ranks of the political parties.\n\nAfter the election, when we analyzed the vote county by county, we\ndiscovered that in every county whose residents were principally\nAmericans the amendment was carried, whereas in all counties populated\nlargely by foreigners it was lost. In certain counties--those inhabited\nby Russian Jews--the vote was almost solidly against us, and this\nnotwithstanding the fact that the wives of these Russian voters were\ndoing a man's work on their farms in addition to the usual women's work\nin their homes. The fact that our Cause could be defeated by ignorant\nlaborers newly come to our country was a humiliating one to accept; and\nwe realized more forcibly than ever before the difficulty of the task we\nhad assumed--a task far beyond any ever undertaken by a body of men in\nthe history of democratic government throughout the world. We not only\nhad to bring American men back to a belief in the fundamental\nprinciples of republican government, but we had also to educate ignorant\nimmigrants, as well as our own Indians, whose degree of civilization\nwas indicated by their war-paint and the flaunting feathers of their\nhead-dresses.\n\nThe Kansas campaign, which Miss Anthony, Mrs. Catt, Mrs. Johns, and\nI conducted in 1894, held a special interest, due to the Populist\nmovement. There were so many problems before the people--prohibition,\nfree silver, and the Populist propaganda--that we found ourselves\ninvolved in the bitterest campaign ever fought out in the state. Our\ndesire, of course, was to get the indorsement of the different political\nparties and religious bodies, We succeeded in obtaining that of three\nout of four of the Methodist Episcopal conferences--the Congregational,\nthe Epworth League, and the Christian Endeavor League--as well as that\nof the State Teachers' Association, the Woman's Christian Temperance\nUnion, and various other religious and philanthropic societies. To\nobtain the indorsement of the political parties was much more difficult,\nand we were facing conditions in which partial success was worse than\ncomplete failure. It had long been an unwritten law before it became a\nwritten law in our National Association that we must not take partisan\naction or line up with any one political party. It was highly important,\ntherefore, that either all parties should support us or that none\nshould.\n\nThe Populist convention was held in Topeka before either the Democratic\nor Republican convention, and after two days of vigorous fighting, led\nby Mrs. Anna Diggs and other prominent Populist women, a suffrage plank\nwas added to the platform. The Populist party invited me, as a minister,\nto open the convention with prayer. This was an innovation, and served\nas a wedge for the admission of women representatives of the Suffrage\nAssociation to address the convention. We all did so, Miss Anthony\nspeaking first, Mrs. Catt second, and I last; after which, for the first\ntime in history, the Doxology was sung at a political convention.\n\nAt the Democratic convention we made the same appeal, and were refused.\nInstead of indorsing us, the Democrats put an anti-suffrage plank in\ntheir platform--but this, as the party had little standing in Kansas,\nprobably did us more good than harm. Trouble came thick and fast,\nhowever, when the Republicans, the dominant party in the state, held\ntheir convention; and a mighty struggle began over the admission of a\nsuffrage plank. There was a Woman's Republican Club in Kansas, which\nheld its convention in Topeka at the same time the Republicans were\nholding theirs. There was also a Mrs. Judith Ellen Foster, who, by\nstirring up opposition in this Republican Club against the insertion\nof a suffrage plank, caused a serious split in the convention. Miss\nAnthony, Mrs. Catt, and I, of course, urged the Republican women to\nstand by their sex, and to give their support to the Republicans only on\ncondition that the latter added suffrage to their platform. At no time,\nand in no field of work, have I ever seen a more bitter conflict in\nprogress than that which raged for two days during this Republican\nwomen's convention. Liquor-dealers, joint-keepers, \"boot-leggers,\"\nand all the lawless element of Kansas swung into line at a special\nconvention held under the auspices of the Liquor League of Kansas City,\nand cast their united weight against suffrage by threatening to deny\ntheir votes to any candidate or political party favoring our Cause.\nThe Republican women's convention finally adjourned with nothing\naccomplished except the passing of a resolution mildly requesting the\nRepublican party to indorse woman suffrage. The result was, of course,\nthat it was not indorsed by the Republican convention, and that it was\ndefeated at the following election.\n\nIt was at the time of these campaigns that I was elected Vice-President\nof the National Association and Lecturer at Large, and the latter\noffice brought in its train a glittering variety of experiences. On one\noccasion an episode occurred which \"Aunt Susan\" never afterward wearied\nof describing. There was a wreck somewhere on the road on which I was\nto travel to meet a lecture engagement, and the trains going my way were\nnot running. Looking up the track, however, I saw a train coming from\nthe opposite direction. I at once grasped my hand-luggage and started\nfor it.\n\n\"Wait! Wait!\" cried Miss Anthony. \"That train's going the wrong way!\"\n\n\"At least it's going SOMEWHERE!\" I replied, tersely, as the train\nstopped, and I climbed the steps.\n\nLooking back when the train had started again, I saw \"Aunt Susan\"\nstanding in the same spot on the platform and staring after it with\nincredulous eyes; but I was right, for I discovered that by going\nup into another state I could get a train which would take me to\nmy destination in time for the lecture that night. It was a fine\nillustration of my pet theory that if one intends to get somewhere it is\nbetter to start, even in the wrong direction, than to stand still.\n\nAgain and again in our work we had occasion to marvel over men's lack of\nunderstanding of the views of women, even of those nearest and dearest\nto them; and we had an especially striking illustration of this at one\nof our hearings in Washington. A certain distinguished gentleman (we\nwill call him Mr. H----) was chairman of the Judiciary, and after we had\nsaid what we wished to say, he remarked:\n\n\"Your arguments are logical. Your cause is just. The trouble is that\nwomen don't want suffrage. My wife doesn't want it. I don't know a\nsingle woman who does want it.\"\n\nAs it happened for this unfortunate gentleman, his wife was present at\nthe hearing and sitting beside Miss Anthony. She listened to his words\nwith surprise, and then whispered to \"Aunt Susan\":\n\n\"How CAN he say that? _I_ want suffrage, and I've told him so a hundred\ntimes in the last twenty years.\"\n\n\"Tell him again NOW,\" urged Miss Anthony. \"Here's your chance to impress\nit on his memory.\"\n\n\"Here!\" gasped the wife. \"Oh, I wouldn't dare.\"\n\n\"Then may I tell him?\"\n\n\"Why--yes! He can think what he pleases, but he has no right to publicly\nmisrepresent me.\"\n\nThe assent, hesitatingly begun, finished on a sudden note of firmness.\nMiss Anthony stood up.\n\n\"It may interest Mr. H----,\" she said, \"to know that his wife DOES wish\nto vote, and that for twenty years she has wished to vote, and has often\ntold him so, though he has evidently forgotten it. She is here beside\nme, and has just made this explanation.\"\n\nMr. H---- stammered and hesitated, and finally decided to laugh. But\nthere was no mirth in the sound he made, and I am afraid his wife had\na bad quarter of an hour when they met a little later in the privacy of\ntheir home.\n\nAmong other duties that fell to my lot at this period were numerous\nsuffrage debates with prominent opponents of the Cause. I have already\nreferred to the debate in Kansas with Senator Ingalls. Equaling this\nin importance was a bout with Dr. Buckley, the distinguished Methodist\ndebater, which had been arranged for us at Chautauqua by Bishop Vincent\nof the Methodist Church. The bishop was not a believer in suffrage, nor\nwas he one of my admirers. I had once aroused his ire by replying to\na sermon he had delivered on \"God's Women,\" and by proving, to my own\nsatisfaction at least, that the women he thought were God's women had\ndone very little, whereas the work of the world had been done by those\nhe believed were not \"God's Women.\" There was considerable interest,\ntherefore, in the Buckley-Shaw debate he had arranged; we all knew he\nexpected Dr. Buckley to wipe out that old score, and I was determined to\nmake it as difficult as possible for the distinguished gentleman to do\nso. We held the debate on two succeeding days, I speaking one afternoon\nand Dr. Buckley replying the following day. On the evening before I\nspoke, however, Dr. Buckley made an indiscreet remark, which, blown\nabout Chautauqua on the light breeze of gossip, was generally regarded\nas both unchivalrous and unfair.\n\nAs the hall in which we were to speak was enormous, he declared that one\nof two things would certainly happen. Either I would scream in order to\nbe heard by my great audience, or I would be unable to make myself heard\nat all. If I screamed it would be a powerful argument against women as\npublic speakers; if I could not be heard, it would be an even better\nargument. In either case, he summed up, I was doomed to failure.\nFollowing out this theory, he posted men in the extreme rear of the\ngreat hall on the day of my lecture, to report to him whether my words\nreached them, while he himself graciously occupied a front seat. Bishop\nVincent's antagonistic feeling was so strong, however, that though, as\nthe presiding officer of the occasion, he introduced me to the audience,\nhe did not wait to hear my speech, but immediately left the hall--and\nthis little slight added to the public's interest in the debate. It\nwas felt that the two gentlemen were not quite \"playing fair,\" and the\nchampions of the Cause were especially enthusiastic in their efforts to\nmake up for these failures in courtesy. My friends turned out in force\nto hear the lecture, and on the breast of every one of them flamed the\nyellow bow that stood for suffrage, giving to the vast hall something of\nthe effect of a field of yellow tulips in full bloom.\n\nWhen Dr. Buckley rose to reply the next day these friends were again\nawaiting him with an equally jocund display of the suffrage color, and\nthis did not add to his serenity. During his remarks he made the serious\nmistake of losing his temper; and, unfortunately for him, he directed\nhis wrath toward a very old man who had thoughtlessly applauded by\npounding on the floor with his cane when Dr. Buckley quoted a point I\nhad made. The doctor leaned forward and shook his fist at him.\n\n\"Think she's right, do you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted the venerable citizen, briskly, though a little startled\nby the manner of the question.\n\n\"Old man,\" shouted Dr. Buckley, \"I'll make you take that back if you've\ngot a grain of sense in your head!\"\n\nThe insult cost him his audience. When he realized this he lost all his\nself-possession, and, as the Buffalo Courier put it the next day, \"went\nup and down the platform raving like a Billingsgate fishwife.\" He lost\nthe debate, and the supply of yellow ribbon left in the surrounding\ncounties was purchased that night to be used in the suffrage celebration\nthat followed. My friends still refer to the occasion as \"the day we\nwiped up the earth with Dr. Buckley\"; but I do not deserve the implied\ntribute, for Dr. Buckley would have lost his case without a word from\nme. What really gave me some satisfaction, however, was the respective\ndegree of freshness with which he and I emerged from our combat. After\nmy speech Miss Anthony and I were given a reception, and stood for hours\nshaking hands with hundreds of men and women. Later in the evening we\nhad a dinner and another reception, which, lasting, as they did, until\nmidnight, kept us from our repose. Dr. Buckley, poor gentleman, had to\nbe taken to his hotel immediately after his speech, given a hot bath,\nrubbed down, and put tenderly to bed; and not even the sympathetic heart\nof Susan B. Anthony yearned over him when she heard of his exhaustion.\n\nIt was also at Chautauqua, by the way, though a number of years earlier,\nthat I had my much misquoted encounter with the minister who deplored\nthe fashion I followed in those days of wearing my hair short. This\nyoung man, who was rather a pompous person, saw fit to take me to task\nat a table where a number of us were dining together.\n\n\"Miss Shaw,\" he said, abruptly, \"I have been asked very often why\nyou wear your hair short, and I have not been able to explain. Of\ncourse\"--this kindly--\"I know there is some good reason. I ventured to\nadvance the theory that you have been ill and that your hair has fallen\nout. Is that it?\"\n\n\"No,\" I told him. \"There is a reason, as you suggest. But it is not that\none.\"\n\n\"Then why--\" he insisted.\n\n\"I am rather sensitive about it,\" I explained. \"I don't know that I care\nto discuss the subject.\"\n\nThe young minister looked pained. \"But among friends--\" he protested.\n\n\"True,\" I conceded. \"Well, then, among friends, I will admit frankly\nthat it is a birthmark. I was born with short hair.\"\n\nThat was the last time my short hair was criticized in my presence, but\nthe young minister was right in his disapproval and I was wrong, as I\nsubsequently realized. A few years later I let my hair grow long, for\nI had learned that no woman in public life can afford to make herself\nconspicuous by any eccentricity of dress or appearance. If she does so\nshe suffers for it herself, which may not disturb her, and to a greater\nor less degree she injures the cause she represents, which should\ndisturb her very much.\n\n\n\n\nXII. BUILDING A HOME\n\nIt is not generally known that the meeting of the International Council\nof Women held in Chicago during the World's Fair was suggested by Miss\nAnthony, as was also the appointment of the Exposition's \"Board of Lady\nManagers.\" \"Aunt Susan\" kept her name in the background, that she might\nnot array against these projects the opposition of those prejudiced\nagainst woman suffrage. We both spoke at the meetings, however, as\nI have already explained, and one of our most chastening experiences\noccurred on \"Actress Night.\" There was a great demand for tickets for\nthis occasion, as every one seemed anxious to know what kind of speeches\nour leading women of the stage would make; and the programme offered\nsuch magic names as Helena Modjeska, Julia Marlowe, Georgia Cayvan,\nClara Morris, and others of equal appeal. The hall was soon filled, and\nto keep out the increasing throng the doors were locked and the waiting\ncrowd was directed to a second hall for an overflow meeting.\n\nAs it happened, Miss Anthony and I were among the earliest arrivals at\nthe main hall. It was the first evening we had been free to do exactly\nas we pleased, and we were both in high spirits, looking forward to the\nspeeches, congratulating each other on the good seats we had been given\non the platform, and rallying the speakers on their stage fright; for,\nmuch to our amusement, we had found them all in mortal terror of their\naudience. Georgia Cayvan, for example, was so nervous that she had to\nbe strengthened with hot milk before she could speak, and Julia Marlowe\nadmitted freely that her knees were giving way beneath her. They really\nhad something of an ordeal before them, for it was decided that each\nactress must speak twice going immediately from the hall to the overflow\nmeeting and repeating there the speech she had just made. But in the\nmean time some one had to hold the impatient audience in the second\nhall, and as it was a duty every one else promptly repudiated, a row of\nsuddenly imploring faces turned toward Miss Anthony and me. I admit that\nwe responded to the appeal with great reluctance. We were SO comfortable\nwhere we were--and we were also deeply interested in the first intimate\nglimpse we were having of these stars in the dramatic sky. We saw our\nduty, however, and with deep sighs we rose and departed for the second\nhall, where a glance at the waiting throng did not add to our pleasure\nin the prospect before us.\n\nWhen I walked upon the stage I found myself facing an actually hostile\naudience. They had come to look at and listen to the actresses who had\nbeen promised them, and they thought they were being deprived of that\nprivilege by an interloper. Never before had I gazed out on a mass of\nsuch unresponsive faces or looked into so many angry eyes. They were\nexchanging views on their wrongs, and the general buzz of conversation\ncontinued when I appeared. For some moments I stood looking at them,\nmy hands behind my back. If I had tried to speak they would undoubtedly\nhave gone on talking; my silence attracted their attention and they\nbegan to wonder what I intended to do. When they had stopped whispering\nand moving about, I spoke to them with the frankness of an overburdened\nheart.\n\n\"I think,\" I said, slowly and distinctly, \"that you are the most\ndisagreeable audience I ever faced in my life.\"\n\nThey gasped and stared, almost open-mouthed in their surprise.\n\n\"Never,\" I went on, \"have I seen a gathering of people turn such ugly\nlooks upon a speaker who has sacrificed her own enjoyment to come and\ntalk to them. Do you think I want to talk to you?\" I demanded, warming\nto my subject. \"I certainly do not. Neither does Miss Anthony want to\ntalk to you, and the lady who spoke to you a few moments ago, and whom\nyou treated so rudely, did not wish to be here. We would all much prefer\nto be in the other hall, listening to the speakers from our comfortable\nseats on the stage. To entertain you we gave up our places and came here\nsimply because the committee begged us to do so. I have only one thing\nmore to say. If you care to listen to me courteously I am willing to\nwaste time on you; but don't imagine that I will stand here and wait\nwhile you criticize the management.\"\n\nBy this time I felt as if I had a child across my knee to whom I was\nadministering maternal chastisement, and the uneasiness of my audience\nunderlined the impression. They listened rather sulkily at first; then\na few of the best-natured among them laughed, and the laugh grew and\ndeveloped into applause. The experience had done them good, and they\nwere a chastened band when Clara Morris appeared, and I gladly yielded\nthe floor to her.\n\nAll the actresses who spoke that night delivered admirable addresses,\nbut no one equaled Madame Modjeska, who delivered exquisitely a speech\nwritten, not by herself, but by a friend and countrywoman, on the\ncondition of Polish women under the regime of Russia. We were all\ncharmed as we listened, but none of us dreamed what that address would\nmean to Modjeska. It resulted in her banishment from Poland, her native\nland, which she was never again permitted to enter. But though she paid\nso heavy a price for the revelation, I do not think she ever really\nregretted having given to America the facts in that speech.\n\nDuring this same period I embarked upon a high adventure. I had always\nlonged for a home, and my heart had always been loyal to Cape Cod. Now I\ndecided to have a home at Wianno, across the Cape from my old parish at\nEast Dennis. Deep-seated as my home-making aspiration had been, it was\nrealized largely as the result of chance. A special hobby of mine has\nalways been auction sales. I dearly love to drop into auction-rooms\nwhile sales are in progress, and bid up to the danger-point, taking care\nto stop just in time to let some one else get the offered article. But\nof course I sometimes failed to stop at the psychological moment, and\nthe result was a sudden realization that, in the course of the years, I\nhad accumulated an extraordinary number of articles for which I had no\nshelter and no possible use.\n\nThe crown jewel of the collection was a bedroom set I had picked up in\nPhiladelphia. Usually, cautious friends accompanied me on my auction-room\nexpeditions and restrained my ardor; but this time I got away alone and\nfound myself bidding at the sale of a solid bog-wood bedroom set which\nhad been exhibited as a show-piece at the World's Fair, and was now,\nin the words of the auctioneer, \"going for a song.\" I sang the song. I\noffered twenty dollars, thirty dollars, forty dollars, and other excited\nvoices drowned mine with higher bids. It was very thrilling. I offered\nfifty dollars, and there was a horrible silence, broken at last by the\nauctioneer's final, \"Going, going, GONE!\" I was mistress of the\nbog-wood bedroom set--a set wholly out of harmony with everything else\nI possessed, and so huge and massive that two men were required to\nlift the head-board alone. Like many of the previous treasures I had\nacquired, this was a white elephant; but, unlike some of them, it was\nworth more than I had paid for it. I was offered sixty dollars for one\npiece alone, but I coldly refused to sell it, though the tribute to my\njudgment warmed my heart. I had not the faintest idea what to do with\nthe set, however, and at last I confided my dilemma to my friend, Mrs.\nEllen Dietrick, who sagely advised me to build a house for it. The idea\nintrigued me. The bog-wood furniture needed a home, and so did I.\n\nThe result of our talk was that Mrs. Dietrick promised to select a\nlot for me at Wianno, where she herself lived, and even promised to\nsupervise the building of my cottage, and to attend to all the other\ndetails connected with it. Thus put, the temptation was irresistible.\nBesides Mrs. Dietrick, many other delightful friends lived at\nWianno--the Garrisons, the Chases of Rhode Island, the Wymans, the\nWellingtons--a most charming community. I gave Mrs. Dietrick full\nauthority to use her judgment in every detail connected with the\nundertaking, and the cottage was built. Having put her hand to this\nplow of friendship, Mrs. Dietrick did the work with characteristic\nthoroughness. I did not even visit Wianno to look at my land. She\nselected it, bought it, engaged a woman architect--Lois Howe of\nBoston--and followed the latter's work from beginning to end. The only\nstipulation I made was that the cottage must be far up on the beach, out\nof sight of everybody--really in the woods; and this was easily met, for\nalong that coast the trees came almost to the water's edge.\n\nThe cottage was a great success, and for many years I spent my vacations\nthere, filling the place with young people. From the time of my sister\nMary's death I had had the general oversight of her two daughters,\nLola and Grace, as well as of Nicolas and Eleanor, the two motherless\ndaughters of my brother John. They were all with me every summer in\nthe new home, together with Lucy Anthony, her sister and brother, Mrs.\nRachel Foster Avery, and other friends. We had special fishing costumes\nmade, and wore them much of the time. My nieces wore knickerbockers, and\nI found vast contentment in short, heavy skirts over bloomers. We lived\nout of doors, boating, fishing, and clamming all day long, and, as in my\nearly pioneer days in Michigan, my part of the work was in the open.\nI chopped all the wood, kept the fires going, and looked after the\ngrounds.\n\nRumors of our care-free and unconventional life began to circulate, and\npresently our Eden was invaded by the only serpent I have ever found in\nthe newspaper world--a girl reporter from Boston. She telegraphed that\nshe was coming to see us; and though, when she came, we had been warned\nof her propensities and received her in conventional attire, formally\nentertaining her with tea on the veranda, she went away and gave free\nplay to a hectic fancy. She wrote a sensational full-page article for\na Sunday newspaper, illustrated with pictures showing us all in\nknickerbockers. In this striking work of art I carried a fish net and\npole and wore a handkerchief tied over my head. The article, which was\nheaded THE ADAMLESS EDEN, was almost libelous, and I admit that for\na long time it dimmed our enjoyment of our beloved retreat. Then,\ngradually, my old friends died, Mrs. Dietrick among the first; others\nmoved away; and the character of the entire region changed. It became\nfashionable, privacy was no longer to be found there, and we ceased to\nvisit it. For five years I have not even seen the cottage.\n\nIn 1908 I built the house I now occupy (in Moylan, Pennsylvania), which\nis the realization of a desire I have always had--to build on a tract\nwhich had a stream, a grove of trees, great boulders and rocks, and a\nhill site for the house with a broad outlook, and a railroad station\nconveniently near. The friend who finally found the place for me had\nbegun his quest with the pessimistic remark that I would better wait for\nit until I got to Paradise; but two years later he telegraphed me that\nhe had discovered it on this planet, and he was right. I have only eight\nacres of land, but no one could ask a more ideal site for a cottage; and\non the place is my beloved forest, including a grove of three hundred\nfirs. From every country I have visited I have brought back a tiny tree\nfor this little forest, and now it is as full of memories as of beauty.\n\nTo the surprise of my neighbors, I built my house with its back toward\nthe public road, facing the valley and the stream. \"But you will never\nsee anybody go by,\" they protested. I answered that the one person in\nthe house who was necessarily interested in passers-by was my maid, and\nshe could see them perfectly from the kitchen, which faced the road.\nI enjoy my views from the broad veranda that overlooks the valley, the\nstream, and the country for miles around.\n\nEvery suffragist I have ever met has been a lover of home; and only the\nconviction that she is fighting for her home, her children, for other\nwomen, or for all of these, has sustained her in her public work.\nLooking back on many campaign experiences, I am forced to admit that it\nis not always the privations we endure which make us think most tenderly\nof home. Often we are more overcome by the attentions of well-meaning\nfriends. As an example of this I recall an incident of one Oregon\ncampaign. I was to speak in a small city in the southern part of the\nstate, and on reaching the station, hot, tired, and covered with the\ngrime of a midsummer journey, I found awaiting me a delegation of\ncitizens, a brass-band, and a white carriage drawn by a pair of\nbeautiful white horses. In this carriage, and devotedly escorted by the\ncitizens and the band, the latter playing its hardest, I was driven\nto the City Hall and there met by the mayor, who delivered an address,\nafter which I was crowned with a laurel wreath. Subsequently, with this\nwreath still resting upon my perspiring brow, I was again driven through\nthe streets of the city; and if ever a woman felt that her place was in\nthe home and longed to be in her place, I felt it that day.\n\nAn almost equally trying occasion had San Francisco for its setting. The\ncity had arranged a Fourth of July celebration, at which Miss Anthony\nand I were to speak. Here we rode in a carriage decorated with\nflowers--yellow roses--while just in front of us was the mayor in a\ncarriage gorgeously festooned with purple blossoms. Behind us, for more\nthan a mile, stretched a procession of uniformed policemen, soldiers,\nand citizens, while the sidewalks were lined with men and women whose\nenthusiastic greetings came to Miss Anthony from every side. She was\nenchanted over the whole experience, for to her it meant, as always, not\na personal tribute, but a triumph of the Cause. But I sat by her side\nacutely miserable; for across my shoulders and breast had been draped a\nhuge sash with the word \"Orator\" emblazoned on it, and this was further\nembellished by a striking rosette with streamers which hung nearly\nto the bottom of my gown. It is almost unnecessary to add that this\nremarkable decoration was furnished by a committee of men, and was also\nworn by all the men speakers of the day. Possibly I was overheated by\nthe sash, or by the emotions the sash aroused in me, for I was stricken\nwith pneumonia the following day and experienced my first serious\nillness, from which, however, I soon recovered.\n\nOn our way to California in 1895 Miss Anthony and I spent a day at\nCheyenne, Wyoming, as the guests of Senator and Mrs. Carey, who gave a\ndinner for us. At the table I asked Senator Carey what he considered the\nbest result of the enfranchisement of Wyoming women, and even after the\nlapse of twenty years I am able to give his reply almost word for word,\nfor it impressed me deeply at the time and I have since quoted it again\nand again.\n\n\"There have been many good results,\" he said, \"but the one I consider\nabove all the others is the great change for the better in the character\nof our candidates for office. Consider this for a moment: Since our\nwomen have voted there has never been an embezzlement of public funds,\nor a scandalous misuse of public funds, or a disgraceful condition of\ngraft. I attribute the better character of our public officials almost\nentirely to the votes of the women.\"\n\n\"Those are inspiring facts,\" I conceded, \"but let us be just. There are\nthree men in Wyoming to every woman, and no candidate for office could\nbe elected unless the men voted for him, too. Why, then, don't they\ndeserve as much credit for his election as the women?\"\n\n\"Because,\" explained Senator Carey, promptly, \"women are politically an\nuncertain factor. We can go among men and learn beforehand how they are\ngoing to vote, but we can't do that with women; they keep us guessing.\nIn the old days, when we went into the caucus we knew what resolutions\nput into our platforms would win the votes of the ranchmen, what would\nwin the miners, what would win the men of different nationalities; but\nwe did not know how to win the votes of the women until we began to\nnominate our candidates. Then we immediately discovered that if the\nDemocrats nominated a man of immoral character for office, the women\nvoted for his Republican opponent, and we learned our first big\nlesson--that whatever a candidate's other qualifications for office may\nbe, he must first of all have a clean record. In the old days, when we\nnominated a candidate we asked, 'Can he hold the saloon vote?' Now we\nask, 'Can he hold the women's vote?' Instead of bidding down to the\nsaloon, we bid up to the home.\"\n\nFollowing the dinner there was a large public meeting, at which Miss\nAnthony and I were to speak. Mrs. Jenkins, who was president of the\nSuffrage Association of the state, presided and introduced us to the\nassemblage. Then she added: \"I have introduced you ladies to your\naudience. Now I would like to introduce your audience to you.\" She began\nwith the two Senators and the member of Congress, then introduced the\nGovernor, the Lieutenant-Governor, the state Superintendent of Education,\nand numerous city and state officials. As she went on Miss Anthony grew\nmore and more excited, and when the introductions were over, she said:\n\"This is the first time I have ever seen an audience assembled for woman\nsuffrage made up of the public officials of a state. No one can ever\npersuade me now that men respect women without political power as much\nas they respect women who have it; for certainly in no other state in\nthe Union would it be possible to gather so many public officials under\none roof to listen to the addresses of women.\"\n\nThe following spring we again went West, with Mrs. Catt, Lucy Anthony,\nMiss Hay and Miss Sweet, her secretary, to carry on the Pacific coast\ncampaign of '96, arranged by Mrs. Cooper and her daughter Harriet, of\nOakland--both women of remarkable executive ability. Headquarters were\nsecured in San Francisco, and Miss Hay was put in charge, associated\nwith a large group of California women. It was the second time in the\nhistory of campaigns--the first being in New York--that all the money to\ncarry on the work was raised by the people of the state.\n\nThe last days of the campaign were extremely interesting, and one of\ntheir important events was that the Hon. Thomas Reed, then Speaker of\nthe House of Representatives, for the first time came out publicly for\nsuffrage. Mr. Reed had often expressed himself privately as in favor of\nthe Cause--but he had never made a public statement for us. At Oakland,\none day, the indefatigable and irresistible \"Aunt Susan\" caught him off\nhis guard by persuading his daughter, Kitty Reed, who was his idol, to\nask him to say just one word in favor of our amendment. When he arose we\ndid not know whether he had promised what she asked, and as his speech\nprogressed our hearts sank lower and lower, for all he said was remote\nfrom our Cause. But he ended with these words:\n\n\"There is an amendment of the constitution pending, granting suffrage\nto women. The women of California ought to have suffrage. The men of\nCalifornia ought to give it to them--and the next speaker, Dr. Shaw,\nwill tell you why.\"\n\nThe word was spoken. And though it was not a very strong word, it came\nfrom a strong man, and therefore helped us.\n\nElection day, as usual, brought its surprises and revelations. Mrs.\nCooper asked her Chinese cook how the Chinese were voting--i. e.,\nthe native-born Chinamen who were entitled to vote--and he replied,\nblithely, \"All Chinamen vote for Billy McKee and 'NO' to women!\" It is\nan interesting fact that every Chinese vote was cast against us.\n\nAll day we went from one to another of the polling-places, and I shall\nalways remember the picture of Miss Anthony and the wife of Senator\nSargent wandering around the polls arm in arm at eleven o'clock at\nnight, their tired faces taking on lines of deeper depression with every\nminute; for the count was against us. However, we made a fairly good\nshowing. When the final counts came in we found that we had won the\nstate from the north down to Oakland, and from the south up to San\nFrancisco; but there was not a sufficient majority to overcome the\nadverse votes of San Francisco and Oakland. With more than 230,000 votes\ncast, we were defeated by only 10,000 majority. In San Francisco the\nsaloon element and the most aristocratic section of the city made an\nequal showing against us, while the section occupied by the middle\nworking-class was largely in favor of our amendment. I dwell especially\non this campaign, partly because such splendid work was done by the\nwomen of California, and also because, during the same election, Utah\nand Idaho granted full suffrage to women. This gave us four suffrage\nstates--Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho--and we prepared for future\nstruggles with very hopeful hearts.\n\nIt was during this California campaign, by the way, that I unwittingly\ncaused much embarrassment to a worthy young man. At a mass-meeting held\nin San Francisco, Rabbi Vorsanger, who was not in favor of suffrage for\nwomen, advanced the heartening theory that in a thousand years more they\nmight possibly be ready for it. After a thousand years of education for\nwomen, of physically developed women, of uncorseted women, he said, we\nmight have the ideal woman, and could then begin to talk about freedom\nfor her.\n\nWhen the rabbi sat down there was a shout from the audience for me to\nanswer him, but all I said was that the ideal woman would be rather\nlonely, as it would certainly take another thousand years to develop an\nideal man capable of being a mate for her. On the following night Prof.\nHoward Griggs, of Stanford University, made a speech on the modern\nwoman--a speech so admirably thought out and delivered that we were all\ndelighted with it. When he had finished the audience again called on\nme, and I rose and proceeded to make what my friends frankly called \"the\nworst break\" of my experience. Rabbi Vorsanger's ideal woman was still\nin my mind, and I had been rather hard on the men in my reply to the\nrabbi the night before; so now I hastened to give this clever young\nman his full due. I said that though the rabbi thought it would take a\nthousand years to make an ideal woman, I believed that, after all, it\nmight not take as long to make the ideal man. We had something very near\nit in a speaker who could reveal such ability, such chivalry, and such\nbreadth of view as Professor Griggs had just shown that he possessed.\n\nThat night I slept the sleep of the just and the well-meaning, and it\nwas fortunate I did, for the morning newspapers had a surprise for me\nthat called for steady nerves and a sense of humor. Across the front\npage of every one of them ran startling head-lines to this effect:\n\n     DR. SHAW HAS FOUND HER IDEAL MAN\n     The Prospects Are That She Will\n     Remain in California\n\nProfessor Griggs was young enough to be my son, and he was already\nmarried and the father of two beautiful children; but these facts were\nnot permitted to interfere with the free play of fancy in journalistic\nminds. For a week the newspapers were filled with all sorts of articles,\ncaricatures, and editorials on my ideal man, which caused me much\nannoyance and some amusement, while they plunged Professor Griggs\ninto an abysmal gloom. In the end, however, the experience proved an\nexcellent one for him, for the publicity attending his speech made him\ndecide to take up lecturing as a profession, which he eventually did\nwith great success. But neither of us has yet heard the last of the\nIdeal Man episode. Only a few years ago, on his return to California\nafter a long absence, one of the leading Sunday newspapers of the state\nheralded Professor Griggs's arrival by publishing a full-page article\nbearing his photograph and mine and this flamboyant heading:\n\n     SHE MADE HIM\n     And Dr. Shaw's Ideal Man Became the\n     Idol of American Women and\n     Earns $30,000 a Year\n\nWe had other unusual experiences in California, and the display of\naffluence on every side was not the least impressive of them. In one\ntown, after a heavy rain, I remember seeing a number of little boys\nscraping the dirt from the gutters, washing it, and finding tiny nuggets\nof gold. We learned that these boys sometimes made two or three dollars\na day in this way, and that the streets of the town--I think it was\nMarysville--contained so much gold that a syndicate offered to level the\nwhole town and repave the streets in return for the right to wash out\nthe gold. This sounds like the kind of thing Americans tell to trustful\nvisitors from foreign lands, but it is quite true. Nuggets, indeed,\nwere so numerous that at one of our meetings, when we were taking up a\ncollection, I cheerfully suggested that our audience drop a few into the\nbox, as we had not had a nugget since we reached the state. There were\nno nuggets in the subsequent collection, but there was a note which\nread: \"If Dr. Shaw will accept a gold nugget, I will see that she does\nnot leave town without one.\" I read this aloud, and added, \"I have never\nrefused a gold nugget in my life.\"\n\nThe following day brought me a pin made of a very beautiful gold nugget,\nand a few days later another Californian produced a cluster of smaller\nnuggets which he had washed out of a panful of earth and insisted on my\naccepting half of them. I was not accustomed to this sort of generosity,\nbut it was characteristic of the spirit of the state. Nowhere else,\nduring our campaign experiences, were we so royally treated in every\nway. As a single example among many, I may mention that Mrs. Leland\nStanford once happened to be on a train with us and to meet Miss\nAnthony. As a result of this chance encounter she gave our whole party\npasses on all the lines of the Southern Pacific Railroad, for use during\nthe entire campaign. Similar generosity was shown us on every side, and\nthe question of finance did not burden us from the beginning to the end\nof the California work.\n\nIn our Utah and Idaho campaigns we had also our full share of new\nexperiences, and of these perhaps the most memorable to me was the\nsermon I preached in the Mormon Tabernacle at Salt Lake City. Before I\nleft New York the Mormon women had sent me the invitation to preach this\nsermon, and when I reached Salt Lake City and the so-called \"Gentile\"\nwomen heard of the plan, they at once invited me to preach to the\n\"Gentiles\" on the evening of the same Sunday, in the Salt Lake City\nOpera House.\n\nOn the morning of the sermon I approached the Mormon Tabernacle with\nmuch more trepidation than I usually experienced before entering a\npulpit. I was not sure what particular kind of trouble I would get into,\nbut I had an abysmal suspicion that trouble of some sort lay in wait for\nme, and I shivered in the anticipation of it. Fortunately, my anxiety\nwas not long drawn out. I arrived only a few moments before the hour\nfixed for the sermon, and found the congregation already assembled and\nthe Tabernacle filled with the beautiful music of the great organ. On\nthe platform, to which I was escorted by several leading dignitaries\nof the church, was the characteristic Mormon arrangement of seats. The\nfirst row was occupied by the deacons, and in the center of these was\nthe pulpit from which the deacons preach. Above these seats was a second\nrow, occupied by ordained elders, and there they too had their own\npulpit. The third row was occupied by, the bishops and the highest\ndignitaries of the church, with the pulpit from which the bishops\npreach; and behind them all, an effective human frieze, was the really\nwonderful Mormon choir.\n\nAs I am an ordained elder in my church, I occupied the pulpit in the\nmiddle row of seats, with the deacons below me and the bishops just\nbehind. Scattered among the congregation were hundreds of \"Gentiles\"\nready to leap mentally upon any concession I might make to the Mormon\nfaith; while the Mormons were equally on the alert for any implied\ncriticism of them and their church. The problem of preaching a sermon\nwhich should offer some appeal to both classes, without offending\neither, was a perplexing one, and I solved it to the best of my ability\nby delivering a sermon I had once given in my own church to my own\npeople. When I had finished I was wholly uncertain of its effect, but\nat the end of the services one of the bishops leaned toward me from his\nplace in the rear, and, to my mingled horror and amusement, offered me\nthis tribute, \"That is one of the best Mormon sermons ever preached in\nthis Tabernacle.\"\n\nI thanked him, but inwardly I was aghast. What had I said to give him\nsuch an impression? I racked my brain, but could recall nothing that\njustified it. I passed the day in a state of nervous apprehension,\nfully expecting some frank criticism from the \"Gentiles\" on the score of\nhaving delivered a Mormon sermon to ingratiate myself into the favor of\nthe Mormons and secure their votes for the constitutional amendment.\nBut nothing of the kind was said. That evening, after the sermon to the\n\"Gentiles,\" a reception was given to our party, and I drew my first deep\nbreath when the wife of a well-known clergyman came to me and introduced\nherself in these words:\n\n\"My husband could not come here to-night, but he heard your sermon this\nmorning. He asked me to tell you how glad he was that under such unusual\nconditions you held so firmly to the teachings of Christ.\"\n\nThe next day I was still more reassured. A reception was given us at\nthe home of one of Brigham Young's daughters, and the receiving-line was\ngraced by the presiding elder of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was\na bluff and jovial gentleman, and when he took my hand he said, warmly,\n\"Well, Sister Shaw, you certainly gave our Mormon friends the biggest\ndose of Methodism yesterday that they ever got in their lives.\"\n\nAfter this experience I reminded myself again that what Frances Willard\nso frequently said is true; All truth is our truth when it has reached\nour hearts; we merely rechristen it according to our individual creeds.\n\nDuring the visit I had an interesting conversation with a number of the\nyounger Mormon women. I was to leave the city on a midnight train, and\nabout twenty of them, including four daughters of Brigham Young, came to\nmy hotel to remain with me until it was time to go to the station. They\nfilled the room, sitting around in school-girl fashion on the floor and\neven on the bed. It was an unusual opportunity to learn some things I\nwished to know, and I could not resist it.\n\n\"There are some questions I would like to ask you,\" I began, \"and one\nor two of them may seem impertinent. But they won't be asked in that\nspirit--and please don't answer any that embarrass you.\"\n\nThey exchanged glances, and then told me to ask as many questions as I\nwished.\n\n\"First of all,\" I said, \"I would like to know the real attitude toward\npolygamy of the present generation of Mormon women. Do you all believe\nin it?\"\n\nThey assured me that they did.\n\n\"How many of you,\" I then asked, \"are polygamous wives?\"\n\nThere was not one in the group. \"But,\" I insisted, \"if you really\nbelieve in polygamy, why is it that some of your husbands have not taken\nmore than one wife?\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence, while each woman looked around as if\nwaiting for another to answer. At last one of them said, slowly:\n\n\"In my case, I alone was to blame. For years I could not force myself to\nconsent to my husband's taking another wife, though I tried hard. By\nthe time I had overcome my objection the law was passed prohibiting\npolygamy.\"\n\nA second member of the group hastened to tell her story. She had had a\nsimilar spiritual struggle, and just as she reached the point where she\nwas willing to have her husband take another wife, he died. And now the\nroom was filled with eager voices. Four or five women were telling at\nonce that they, too, had been reluctant in the beginning, and that when\nthey had reached the point of consent this, that, or another cause had\nkept the husbands from marrying again. They were all so passionately in\nearnest that they stared at me in puzzled wonder when I broke into the\nsudden laughter I could not restrain.\n\n\"What fortunate women you all were!\" I exclaimed, teasingly. \"Not one of\nyou arrived at the point of consenting to the presence of a second wife\nin your home until it was impossible for your husband to take her.\"\n\nThey flushed a little at that, and then laughed with me; but they\ndid not defend themselves against the tacit charge, and I turned the\nconversation into less personal channels. I learned that many of the\nMormon young men were marrying girls outside of the Church, and that two\nsons of a leading Mormon elder had married and were living very happily\nwith Catholic girls.\n\nAt this time the Mormon candidate for Congress (a man named Roberts)\nwas a bitter opponent of woman suffrage. The Mormon women begged me to\nchallenge him to a debate on the subject, which I did, but Mr. Roberts\ndeclined the challenge. The ground of his refusal, which he made public\nthrough the newspapers, was chastening to my spirit. He explained that\nhe would not debate with me because he was not willing to lower himself\nto the intellectual plane of a woman.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. PRESIDENT OF \"THE NATIONAL\"\n\nIn 1900 Miss Anthony, then over eighty, decided that she must resign\nthe presidency of our National Association, and the question of the\nsuccessor she would choose became an important one. It was conceded that\nthere were only two candidates in her mind--Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt and\nmyself--and for several months we gave the suffrage world the unusual\nspectacle of rivals vigorously pushing each other's claims. Miss Anthony\nwas devoted to us both, and I think the choice was a hard one for her to\nmake. On the one hand, I had been vice-president at large and her almost\nconstant companion for twelve years, and she had grown accustomed to\nthink of me as her successor. On the other hand, Mrs. Catt had been\nchairman of the organization committee, and through her splendid\nexecutive ability had built up our organization in many states. From\nMiss Anthony down, we all recognized her steadily growing powers; she\nhad, moreover, abundant means, which I had not.\n\nIn my mind there was no question of her superior qualification for the\npresidency. She seemed to me the logical and indeed the only possible\nsuccessor to Miss Anthony; and I told \"Aunt Susan\" so with all the\neloquence I could command, while simultaneously Mrs. Catt was pouring\ninto Miss Anthony's other ear a series of impassioned tributes to me.\nIt was an unusual situation and a very pleasant one, and it had two\nexcellent results: it simplified \"Aunt Susan's\" problem by eliminating\nthe element of personal ambition, and it led to her eventual choice of\nMrs. Catt as her successor.\n\nI will admit here for the first time that in urging Mrs. Catt's fitness\nfor the office I made the greatest sacrifice of my life. My highest\nambition had been to succeed Miss Anthony, for no one who knew her as I\ndid could underestimate the honor of being chosen by her to carry on her\nwork.\n\nAt the convention in Washington that year she formally refused the\nnomination for re-election, as we had all expected, and then, on being\nurged to choose her own successor, she stepped forward to do so. It was\na difficult hour, for her fiery soul resented the limitations imposed by\nher worn-out body, and to such a worker the most poignant experience in\nlife is to be forced to lay down one's work at the command of old age.\nOn this she touched briefly, but in a trembling voice; and then, in\nfurtherance of the understanding between the three of us, she presented\nthe name of Mrs. Catt to the convention with all the pride and hope a\nmother could feel in the presentation of a daughter.\n\nHer faith was fully justified. Mrs. Catt made an admirable president,\nand during every moment of the four years she held the office she had\nMiss Anthony's whole-hearted and enthusiastic support, while I, too,\nin my continued office of vice-president, did my utmost to help her\nin every way. In 1904, however, Mrs. Catt was elected president of the\nInternational Suffrage Alliance, as I have mentioned before, and that\nsame year she resigned the presidency of our National Association, as\nher health was not equal to the strain of carrying the two offices.\n\nMiss Anthony immediately urged me to accept the presidency of the\nNational Association, which I was now most unwilling to do; I had lost\nmy ambition to be president, and there were other reasons, into which I\nneed not go again, why I felt that I could not accept the post. At last,\nhowever, Miss Anthony actually commanded me to take the place, and there\nwas nothing to do but obey her. She was then eighty-four, and, as it\nproved, within two years of her death. It was no time for me to rebel\nagainst her wishes; but I yielded with the heaviest heart I have\never carried, and after my election to the presidency at the national\nconvention in Washington I left the stage, went into a dark corner of\nthe wings, and for the first time since my girlhood \"cried myself sick.\"\n\nIn the work I now took up I found myself much alone. Mrs. Catt was\nreally ill, and the strength of \"Aunt Susan\" must be saved in every way.\nNeither could give me much help, though each did all she should have\ndone, and more. Mrs. Catt, whose husband had recently died, was in a\ndeeply despondent frame of mind, and seemed to feel that the future was\nhopelessly dark. My own panacea for grief is work, and it seemed to\nme that both physically and mentally she would be helped by a wise\ncombination of travel and effort. During my lifetime I have cherished\ntwo ambitions, and only two: the first, as I have already confessed, had\nbeen to succeed Miss Anthony as president of our association; the second\nwas to go around the world, carrying the woman-suffrage ideal to every\ncountry, and starting in each a suffrage society. Long before the\ninception of the International Suffrage Alliance I had dreamed this\ndream; and, though it had receded as I followed it through life, I had\nnever wholly lost sight of it. Now I realized that for me it could never\nbe more than a dream. I could never hope to have enough money at my\ndisposal to carry it out, and it occurred to me that if Mrs. Catt\nundertook it as president of the International Suffrage Alliance the\nresults would be of the greatest benefit to the Cause and to her.\n\nIn my first visit to her after her husband's death I suggested this\nplan, but she replied that it was impossible for her to consider it.\nI did not lose thought of it, however, and at the next International\nConference, held in Copenhagen in 1907, I suggested to some of the\ndelegates that we introduce the matter as a resolution, asking Mrs. Catt\nto go around the world in behalf of woman suffrage. They approved the\nsuggestion so heartily that I followed it up with a speech setting forth\nthe whole plan and Mrs. Catt's peculiar fitness for the work. Several\nmonths later Mrs. Catt and Dr. Aletta Jacobs, president of the Holland\nSuffrage Association, started on their world tour; and not until after\nthey had gone did I fully realize that the two great personal ambitions\nof my life had been realized, not by me, but by another, and in each\ncase with my enthusiastic co-operation.\n\nIn 1904, following my election to the presidency, a strong appeal came\nfrom the Board of Managers of the exposition to be held in Portland,\nOregon, urging us to hold our next annual convention there during\nthe exposition. It was the first time an important body of men had\nrecognized us in this manner, and we gladly responded. So strong a\npolitical factor did the men of Oregon recognize us to be that every\npolitical party in the state asked to be represented on our platform;\nand one entire evening of the convention was given over to the\nrepresentatives chosen by the various parties to indorse the suffrage\nmovement. Thus we began in Oregon the good work we continued in 1906,\nand of which we reaped the harvest in 1912.\n\nNext to \"Suffrage Night,\" the most interesting feature of the exposition\nto us was the unveiling of the statue of Saccawagea, the young Indian\ngirl who led the Lewis and Clark expedition through the dangerous passes\nof the mountain ranges of the Northwest until they reached the Pacific\ncoast. This statue, presented to the exposition by the women of Oregon,\nis the belated tribute of the state to its most dauntless pioneer;\nand no one can look upon the noble face of the young squaw, whose\noutstretched hand points to the ocean, without marveling over the\ningratitude of the nation that ignored her supreme service. To\nSaccawagea is due the opening up of the entire western country. There\nwas no one to guide Lewis and Clark except this Indian, who alone knew\nthe way; and she led the whole party, carrying her papoose on her\nback. She was only sixteen, but she brought every man safely through an\nexperience of almost unparalleled hardship and danger, nursing them\nin sickness and setting them an example of unfaltering courage and\nendurance, until she stood at last on the Pacific coast, where her\nstatue stands now, pointing to the wide sweep of the Columbia River as\nit flows into the sea.\n\nThis recognition by women is the only recognition she ever received.\nBoth Lewis and Clark were sincerely grateful to her and warmly\nrecommended her to the government for reward; but the government allowed\nher absolutely nothing, though each man in the party she had led was\ngiven a large tract of land. Tradition says that she was bitterly\ndisappointed, as well she might have been, and her Indian brain must\nhave been sadly puzzled. But she was treated little worse than thousands\nof the white pioneer women who have followed her; and standing: there\nto-day on the bank of her river, she still seems sorrowfully reflective\nover the strange ways of the nation she so nobly served.\n\nThe Oregon campaign of 1906 was the carrying out of one of Miss\nAnthony's dearest wishes, and we who loved her set about this work soon\nafter her death. In the autumn preceding her passing, headquarters had\nbeen established in Oregon, and Miss Laura Gregg had been placed in\ncharge, with Miss Gale Laughlin as her associate. As the money for this\neffort was raised by the National Association, it was decided, after\nsome discussion, to let the National Association develop the work in\nOregon, which was admittedly a hard state to carry and full of possible\ndifficulties which soon became actual ones.\n\nAs a beginning, the Legislature had failed to submit an amendment; but\nas the initiative and referendum was the law in Oregon, the amendment\nwas submitted through initiative patent. The task of securing the\nnecessary signatures was not an easy one, but at last a sufficient\nnumber of signatures were secured and verified, and the authorities\nissued the necessary proclamation for the vote, which was to take place\nat a special election held on the 5th of June. Our campaign work had\nbeen carried on as extensively as possible, but the distances were great\nand the workers few, and as a result of the strain upon her Miss Gregg's\nhealth soon failed alarmingly.\n\nAll this was happening during Miss Anthony's last illness, and it added\ngreatly to our anxieties.\n\nShe instructed me to go to Oregon immediately after her death and to\ntake her sister Mary and her niece Lucy with me, and we followed these\norders within a week of her funeral, arriving in Portland on the third\nday of April. I had attempted too much, however, and I proved it\nby fainting as I got off the train, to the horror of the friendly\ndelegation waiting to receive us. The Portland women took very tender\ncare of me, and in a few days I was ready for work, but we found\nconditions even worse than we had expected. Miss Gregg had collapsed\nutterly and was unable to give us any information as to what had been\ndone or planned, and we had to make a new foundation. Miss Laura Clay,\nwho had been in the Portland work for a few weeks, proved a tower of\nstrength, and we were soon aided further by Ida Porter Boyer, who came\non to take charge of the publicity department. During the final six\nweeks of the campaign Alice Stone Blackwell, of Boston, was also with\nus, while Kate Gordon took under her special charge the organization of\nthe city of Portland and the parlor-meeting work. Miss Clay went into the\nstate, where Emma Smith DeVoe and other speakers were also working, and\nI spent my time between the office headquarters and \"the road,\" often\nworking at my desk until it was time to rush off and take a train for\nsome town where I was to hold a night meeting. Miss Mary and Miss Lucy\nAnthony confined themselves to office-work in the Portland headquarters,\nwhere they gave us very valuable assistance. I have always believed that\nwe would have carried Oregon that year if the disaster of the California\nearthquake had not occurred to divert the minds of Western men from\ninterest in anything save that great catastrophe.\n\nOn election day it seemed as if the heavens had opened to pour floods\nupon us. Never before or since have I seen such incessant, relentless\nrain. Nevertheless, the women of Portland turned out in force, led by\nMrs. Sarah Evans, president of the Oregon State Federation of Women's\nClubs, while all day long Dr. Pohl took me in her automobile from\none polling-place to another. At each we found representative women\npatiently enduring the drenching rain while they tried to persuade men\nto vote for us. We distributed sandwiches, courage, and inspiration\namong them, and tried to cheer in the same way the women watchers, whose\nappointment we had secured that year for the first time. Two women had\nbeen admitted to every polling-place--but the way in which we had been\nable to secure their presence throws a high-light on the difficulties we\nwere meeting. We had to persuade men candidates to select these women as\nwatchers; and the only men who allowed themselves to be persuaded\nwere those running on minority tickets and hopeless of election--the\nprohibitionists, the socialists, and the candidates of the labor party.\n\nThe result of the election taught us several things. We had been told\nthat all the prohibitionists and socialists would vote for us. Instead,\nwe discovered that the percentage of votes for woman suffrage was about\nthe same in every party, and that whenever the voter had cast a straight\nvote, without independence enough to \"scratch\" his ticket, that vote was\nusually against us. On the other hand, when the ticket was \"scratched\"\nthe vote was usually in our favor, whatever political party the man\nbelonged to.\n\nAnother interesting discovery was that the early morning vote was\nfavorable to our Cause the vote cast by working-men on their way to\ntheir employment. During the middle of the forenoon and afternoon, when\nthe idle class was at the polls, the vote ran against us. The late vote,\ncast as men were returning from their work, was again largely in our\nfavor--and we drew some conclusions from this.\n\nAlso, for the first time in the history of any campaign, the\nanti-suffragists had organized against us. Portland held a small body of\nwomen with antisuffrage sentiments, and there were others in the state\nwho formed themselves into an anti-suffrage society and carried on\na more or less active warfare. In this campaign, for the first time,\nobscene cards directed against the suffragists were circulated at the\npolls; and while I certainly do not accuse the Oregon anti-suffragists\nof circulating them, it is a fact that the cards were distributed as\ncoming from the anti-suffragists--undoubtedly by some vicious element\namong the men which had its own good reason for opposing us. The \"antis\"\nalso suffered in this campaign from the \"pernicious activity\" of their\nspokesman--a lawyer with an unenviable reputation. After the campaign\nwas over this man declared that it had cost the opponents of our measure\n$300,000.\n\nIn 1907 Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont began to show an interest in suffrage\nwork, and through the influence of several leaders in the movement,\nnotably that of Mrs. Ida Husted Harper, she decided to assist in the\nestablishment of national headquarters in the State of New York. For a\nlong time the association's headquarters had been in Warren, Ohio, the\nhome of Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, then national treasurer, and it was\nfelt that their removal to a larger city would have a great influence\nin developing the work. In 1909 Mrs. Belmont attended as a delegate\nthe meeting of the International Suffrage Alliance in London, and\nher interest in the Cause deepened. She became convinced that the\nheadquarters of the association should be in New York City, and at\nour Seattle convention that same year I presented to the delegates her\ngenerous offer to pay the rent and maintain a press department for two\nyears, on condition that our national headquarters were established in\nNew York.\n\nThis proposition was most gratefully accepted, and we promptly secured\nheadquarters in one of the most desirable buildings on Fifth Avenue.\nThe wisdom of the change was demonstrated at once by the extraordinary\ngrowth of the work. During our last year in Warren, for example, the\nproceeds from the sale of our literature were between $1,200 and $1,300.\nDuring the first year in New York our returns from such sales were\nbetween $13,000 and $14,000, and an equal growth was evident in our\nother departments.\n\nAt the end of two years Mrs. Belmont ceased to support the press\ndepartment or to pay the rent, but her timely aid had put us on our\nfeet, and we were able to continue our splendid progress and to meet our\nexpenses.\n\nThe special event of 1908 was the successful completion of the fund\nPresident M. Carey Thomas of Bryn Mawr and Miss Mary Garrett had\npromised in 1906 to raise for the Cause. For some time after Miss\nAnthony's death nothing more was said of this, but I knew those two\nindefatigable friends were not idle, and \"Aunt Susan\" had died in the\nblessed conviction that their success was certain. In 1907 I received a\nletter from Miss Thomas telling me that the project was progressing; and\nlater she sent an outline of her plan, which was to ask a certain number\nof wealthy persons to give five hundred dollars a year each for a term\nof years. In all, a fund of $60,000 was to be raised, of which we were\nto have $12,000 a year for five years; $4,500 of the $12,000 was to be\npaid in salaries to three active officers, and the remaining $7,500\nwas to go toward the work of the association. The entire fund was to be\nraised by May 1, 1908, she added, or the plan would be dropped.\n\nI was on a lecture tour in Ohio in April, 1908, when one night, as I was\nstarting for the hall where the lecture was to be given, my telephone\nbell rang. \"Long distance wants you,\" the operator said, and the\nnext minute a voice I recognized as that of Miss Thomas was offering\ncongratulations. \"The last dollar of the $60,000,\" she added, \"was\npledged at four o'clock this afternoon.\"\n\nI was so overcome by the news that I dropped the receiver and shook in\na violent nervous attack, and this trembling continued throughout my\nlecture. It had not seemed possible that such a burden could be lifted\nfrom my shoulders; $7,500 a year would greatly aid our work, and $4,500\na year, even though divided among three officers, would be a most\nwelcome help to each. As subsequently arranged, the salaries did not\ncome to us through the National Association treasury; they were paid\ndirectly by Miss Thomas and Miss Garrett as custodians of the fund. So\nit is quite correct to say that no salaries have ever been paid by the\nNational Association to its officers.\n\nThree years later, in 1911, another glorious surprise came to me in a\nvery innocent-looking letter. It was one of many in a heavy mail, and I\nopened it absent-mindedly, for the day had been problem-filled.\n\nThe writer stated very simply that she wished to put a large amount into\nmy hands to invest, to draw on, and to use for the Cause as I saw fit.\nThe matter was to be a secret between us, and she wished no subsequent\naccounting, as she had entire faith in my ability to put the money to\nthe best possible use.\n\nThe proposition rather dazed me, but I rallied my forces and replied\nthat I was infinitely grateful, but that the amount she mentioned was\na large one and I would much prefer to share the responsibility of\ndisbursing it. Could she not select one more person, at least, to\nshare the secret and act with me? She replied, telling me to make the\nselection, if I insisted on having a confidante, and I sent her the\nnames of Miss Thomas and Miss Garrett, suggesting that as Miss Thomas\nhad done so much of the work in connection with the $60,000 fund, Miss\nGarrett might be willing to accept the detail work of this fund.\nMy friend replied that either of these ladies would be perfectly\nsatisfactory to her. She knew them both, she said, and I was to arrange\nthe matter as I chose, as it rested wholly in my hands.\n\nI used this money in subsequent state campaigns, and I am very sure\nthat to it was largely due the winning of Arizona, Kansas, and Oregon\nin 1912, and of Montana and Nevada in 1914. It enabled us for the first\ntime to establish headquarters, secure an office force, and engage\ncampaign speakers. I also spent some of it in the states we lost then\nbut will win later--Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan--using in all more\nthan fifteen thousand dollars. In September, 1913, I received another\ncheck from the same friend, showing that she at least was satisfied with\nthe results we had achieved.\n\n\"It goes to you with my love,\" she wrote, \"and my earnest hopes for\nfurther success--not the least of this a crowning of your faithful,\nearnest, splendid work for our beloved Cause. How blessed it is that you\nare our president and leader!\"\n\nI had talked to this woman only twice in my life, and I had not seen her\nfor years when her first check came; so her confidence in me was an even\ngreater gift than her royal donation toward our Cause.\n\n\n\n\nXIV. RECENT CAMPAIGNS\n\nThe interval between the winning of Idaho and Utah in 1896 and that\nof Washington in 1910 seemed very long to lovers of the Cause. We were\nworking as hard as ever--harder, indeed, for the opposition against us\nwas growing stronger as our opponents realized what triumphant woman\nsuffrage would mean to the underworld, the grafters, and the whited\nsepulchers in public office. But in 1910 we were cheered by our\nWashington victory, followed the next year by the winning of California.\nThen, with our splendid banner year of 1912 came the winning of three\nstates--Arizona, Kansas, and Oregon--preceded by a campaign so full of\nvim and interest that it must have its brief chronicle here.\n\nTo begin, we conducted in 1912 the largest number of campaigns we\nhad ever undertaken, working in six states in which constitutional\namendments were pending--Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Oregon, Arizona, and\nKansas. Personally, I began my work in Ohio in August, with the modest\naspiration of speaking in each of the principal towns in every one\nof these states. In Michigan I had the invaluable assistance of Mrs.\nLawrence Lewis, of Philadelphia, and I visited at this time the region\nof my old home, greatly changed since the days of my girlhood, and\ntalked to the old friends and neighbors who had turned out in force to\nwelcome me. They showed their further interest in the most satisfactory\nway, by carrying the amendment in their part of the state.\n\nAt least four and five speeches a day were expected, and as usual\nwe traveled in every sort of conveyance, from freight-cars to eighty\nhorse-power French automobiles. In Eau Clair, Wisconsin, I spoke at the\nraces immediately after the passing of a procession of cattle. At the\nend of the procession rode a woman in an ox-cart, to represent pioneer\ndays. She wore a calico gown and a sunbonnet, and drove her ox-team with\ngenuine skill; and the last touch to the picture she made was furnished\nby the presence of a beautiful biplane which whirred lightly in the air\nabove her. The obvious comparison was too good to ignore, so I told my\nhearers that their women to-day were still riding in ox-teams while\nthe men soared in the air, and that women's work in the world's service\ncould be properly done only when they too were allowed to fly.\n\nIn Oregon we were joined by Miss Lucy Anthony. There, at Pendleton, I\nspoke during the great \"round up,\" holding the meeting at night on\nthe street, in which thousands of horsemen--cowboys, Indians, and\nranchmen--were riding up and down, blowing horns, shouting, and singing.\nIt seemed impossible to interest an audience under such conditions, but\nevidently the men liked variety, for when we began to speak they quieted\ndown and closed around us until we had an audience that filled the\nstreets in every direction and as far as our voices could reach. Never\nhave we had more courteous or enthusiastic listeners than those wild and\nhappy horsemen. Best of all, they not only cheered our sentiments,\nbut they followed up their cheers with their votes. I spoke from an\nautomobile, and when I had finished one of the cowboys rode close to\nme and asked for my New York address. \"You will hear from me later,\" he\nsaid, when he had made a note of it. In time I received a great linen\nbanner, on which he had made a superb pen-and-ink sketch of himself\nand his horse, and in every corner sketches of scenes in the different\nstates where women voted, together with drawings of all the details of\ncowboy equipment. Over these were drawn the words:\n\n        WOMAN SUFFRAGE--WE ARE ALL FOR IT.\n\nThe banner hangs to-day in the National Headquarters.\n\nIn California Mr. Edwards presented me with the money to purchase the\ndiamond in Miss Anthony's flag pin representing the victory of his state\nthe preceding year; and in Arizona one of the highlights of the campaign\nwas the splendid effort of Mrs. Frances Munds, the state president, and\nMrs. Alice Park, of Palo Alto, California, who were carrying on the work\nin their headquarters with tremendous courage, and, as it seemed to me,\nalmost unaided. Mrs. Park's specialty was the distribution of suffrage\nliterature, which she circulated with remarkable judgment. The Governor\nof Arizona was in favor of our Cause, but there were so few active\nworkers available that to me, at least, the winning of the state was a\nhappy surprise.\n\nIn Kansas we stole some of the prestige of Champ Clark, who was making\npolitical speeches in the same region. At one station a brass-band and\na great gathering were waiting for Mr. Clark's train just as our train\ndrew in; so the local suffragists persuaded the band to play for us,\ntoo, and I made a speech to the inspiring accompaniment of \"Hail to the\nChief.\" The passengers on our train were greatly impressed, thinking it\nwas all for us; the crowd at the station were glad to be amused until\nthe great man came, and I was glad of the opportunity to talk to so many\nrepresentative men--so we were all happy.\n\nIn the Soldiers' Home at Leavenworth I told the old men of the days when\nmy father and brothers left us in the wilderness, and my mother and I\ncared for the home while they fought at the front--and I have always\nbelieved that much of the large vote we received at Leavenworth was cast\nby those old soldiers.\n\nNo one who knows the conditions doubts that we really won Michigan that\nyear as well as the three other states, but strange things were done in\nthe count. For example, in one precinct in Detroit forty more votes were\ncounted against our amendment than there were voters in the district. In\nother districts there were seven or eight more votes than voters.\nUnder these conditions it is not surprising that, after the vigorous\nrecounting following the first wide-spread reports of our success,\nMichigan was declared lost to us.\n\nThe campaign of 1914, in which we won Montana and Nevada, deserves\nspecial mention here. I must express also my regret that as this book\nwill be on the presses before the campaign of 1915 is ended, I cannot\ninclude in these reminiscences the results of our work in New York and\nother states.\n\nAs a beginning of the 1914 campaign I spent a day in Chicago, on the way\nto South Dakota, to take my part in a moving-picture suffrage play. It\nwas my first experience as an actress, and I found it a taxing one. As\na modest beginning I was ordered to make a speech in thirty-three\nseconds--something of a task, as my usual time allowance for a speech is\none hour. The manager assured me, however, that a speech of thirty-three\nseconds made twenty-seven feet of film--enough, he thought, to convert\neven a lieutenant-governor!\n\nThe Dakota campaigns, as usual, resolved themselves largely into feats\nof physical endurance, in which I was inspired by the fine example of\nthe state presidents--Mrs. John Pyle of South Dakota and Mrs. Clara\nV. Darrow of North Dakota. Every day we made speeches from the rear\nplatform of the trains on which we were traveling--sometimes only two\nor three, sometimes half a dozen. One day I rode one hundred miles in an\nautomobile and spoke in five different towns. Another day I had to make\na journey in a freight-car. It was, with a few exceptions, the roughest\ntraveling I had yet known, and it took me six hours to reach my\ndestination. While I was gathering up hair-pins and pulling myself\ntogether to leave the car at the end of the ride I asked the conductor\nhow far we had traveled.\n\n\"Forty miles,\" said he, tersely.\n\n\"That means forty miles AHEAD,\" I murmured. \"How far up and down?\"\n\n\"Oh, a hundred miles up and down,\" grinned the conductor, and the\nexchange of persiflage cheered us both.\n\nThough we did not win, I have very pleasant memories of North Dakota,\nfor Mrs. Darrow accompanied me during the entire campaign, and took\nevery burden from my shoulders so efficiently that I had nothing to do\nbut make speeches.\n\nIn Montana our most interesting day was that of the State Fair, which\nended with a suffrage parade that I was invited to lead. On this\noccasion the suffragists wished me to wear my cap and gown and my\ndoctor's hood, but as I had not brought those garments with me, we\nborrowed and I proudly wore the cap and gown of the Unitarian minister.\nIt was a small but really beautiful parade, and all the costumes for it\nwere designed by the state president, Miss Jeannette Rankin, to whose\nfine work, by the way, combined with the work of her friends, the\nwinning of Montana was largely due.\n\nIn Butte the big strike was on, and the town was under martial law. A\nlarge banquet was given us there, and when we drove up to the club-house\nwhere this festivity was to be held we were stopped by two armed guards\nwho confronted us with stern faces and fixed bayonets. The situation\nseemed so absurd that I burst into happy laughter, and thus deeply\noffended the earnest young guards who were grasping the fixed bayonets.\nThis sad memory was wiped out, however, by the interest of the\nbanquet--a very delightful affair, attended by the mayor of Butte and\nother local dignitaries.\n\nIn Nevada the most interesting feature of the campaign was the splendid\nwork of the women. In each of the little towns there was the same spirit\nof ceaseless activity and determination. The president of the State\nAssociation, Miss Anne Martin, who was at the head of the campaign work,\naccompanied me one Sunday when we drove seventy miles in a motor and\nspoke four times, and she was also my companion in a wonderful journey\nover the mountains. Miss Martin was a tireless and worthy leader of the\nfine workers in her state.\n\nIn Missouri, under the direction of Mrs. Walter McNabb Miller, and in\nNebraska, where Mrs. E. Draper Smith was managing the campaign, we\nhad some inspiring meetings. At Lincoln Mrs. William Jennings Bryan\nintroduced me to the biggest audience of the year, and the programme\ntook on a special interest from the fact that it included Mrs. Bryan's\ndebut as a speaker for suffrage. She is a tall and attractive woman with\nan extremely pleasant voice, and she made an admirable speech--clear,\nterse, and much to the point, putting herself on record as a strong\nsupporter of the woman-suffrage movement. There was also an amusing\naftermath of this occasion, which Secretary Bryan himself confided to\nme several months later when I met him in Atlantic City. He assured me,\nwith the deep sincerity he assumes so well, that for five nights after\nmy speech in Lincoln his wife had kept him awake listening to her report\nof it--and he added, solemnly, that he now knew it \"by heart.\"\n\nA less pleasing memory of Nebraska is that I lost my voice there and my\nactivities were sadly interrupted. But I was taken to the home of Mr.\nand Mrs. Francis A. Brogan, of Omaha, and supplied with a trained nurse,\na throat specialist, and such care and comfort that I really enjoyed the\nenforced rest--knowing, too, that the campaign committee was carrying on\nour work with great enthusiasm.\n\nIn Missouri one of our most significant meetings was in Bowling Green,\nthe home of Champ Clark, Speaker of the House. Mrs. Clark gave a\nreception, made a speech, and introduced me at the meeting, as Mrs.\nBryan had done in Lincoln. She is one of the brightest memories of\nmy Missouri experience, for, with few exceptions, she is the most\nentertaining woman I have ever met. Subsequently we had an all-day motor\njourney together, during which Mrs. Clark rarely stopped talking and I\neven more rarely stopped laughing.\n\n\n\n\nXV. CONVENTION INCIDENTS\n\nFrom 1887 to 1914 we had a suffrage convention every year, and I\nattended each of them. In preceding chapters I have mentioned various\nconvention episodes of more or less importance. Now, looking back\nover them all as I near the end of these reminiscences, I recall a few\nadditional incidents which had a bearing on later events. There was,\nfor example, the much-discussed attack on suffrage during the Atlanta\nconvention of 1895, by a prominent clergyman of that city whose name I\nmercifully withhold. On the Sunday preceding our arrival this gentleman\npreached a sermon warning every one to keep away from our meetings, as\nour effort was not to secure the franchise for women, but to encourage\nthe intermarriage of the black and white races. Incidentally he declared\nthat the suffragists were trying to break up the homes of America\nand degrade the morals of women, and that we were all infidels and\nblasphemers. He ended with a personal attack on me, saying that on the\nprevious Sunday I had preached in the Epworth Memorial Methodist Church\nof Cleveland, Ohio, a sermon which was of so blasphemous a nature that\nnothing could purify the church after it except to burn it down.\n\nAs usual at our conventions, I had been announced to preach the sermon\nat our Sunday conference, and I need hardly point out that the reverend\ngentleman's charge created a deep public interest in this effort. I\nhad already selected a text, but I immediately changed my plans and\nannounced that I would repeat the sermon I had delivered in Cleveland\nand which the Atlanta minister considered so blasphemous. The\nannouncement brought out an audience which filled the Opera House and\ncalled for a squad of police officers to keep in order the street crowd\nthat could not secure entrance. The assemblage had naturally expected\nthat I would make some reply to the clergyman's attack, but I made no\nreference whatever to him. I merely repeated, with emphasis, the sermon\nI had delivered in Cleveland.\n\nAt the conclusion of the service one of the trustees of my reverend\ncritic's church came and apologized for his pastor. He had a high regard\nfor him, the trustee said, but in this instance there could be no doubt\nin the mind of any one who had heard both sermons that of the two mine\nwas the tolerant, the reverent, and the Christian one. The attack made\nmany friends for us, first because of its injustice, and next because of\nthe good-humored tolerance with which the suffragists accepted it.\n\nThe Atlanta convention, by the way, was arranged and largely financed by\nthe Misses Howard--three sisters living in Columbus, Georgia, and each\nan officer of the Georgia Woman Suffrage Association. It is a remarkable\nfact that in many of our Southern states the suffrage movement has been\nled by three sisters. In Kentucky the three Clay sisters were for many\nyears leaders in the work. In Texas the three Finnegan sisters did\nsplendid work; in Louisiana the Gordon sisters were our stanchest\nallies, while in Virginia we had the invaluable aid of Mary Johnston,\nthe novelist, and her two sisters. We used to say, laughingly, if there\nwas a failure to organize any state in the South, that it must be due to\nthe fact that no family there had three sisters to start the movement.\n\nFrom the Atlanta convention we went directly to Washington to attend\nthe convention of the National Council of Women, and on the first day of\nthis council Frederick Douglass came to the meeting. Mr. Douglass had a\nspecial place in the hearts of suffragists, for the reason that at the\nfirst convention ever held for woman suffrage in the United States (at\nSeneca Falls, New York) he was the only person present who stood by\nElizabeth Cady Stanton when she presented her resolution in favor of\nvotes for women. Even Lucretia Mott was startled by this radical step,\nand privately breathed into the ear of her friend, \"Elizabeth, thee is\nmaking us ridiculous!\" Frederick Douglass, however, took the floor in\ndefense of Mrs. Stanton's motion, a service we suffragists never forgot.\n\nTherefore, when the presiding officer of the council, Mrs. May Wright\nSewall, saw Mr. Douglass enter the convention hall in Washington on this\nparticular morning, she appointed Susan B. Anthony and me a committee to\nescort him to a seat on the platform, which we gladly did. Mr. Douglass\nmade a short speech and then left the building, going directly to his\nhome. There, on entering his hall, he had an attack of heart failure\nand dropped dead as he was removing his overcoat. His death cast a gloom\nover the convention, and his funeral, which took place three days\nlater, was attended by many prominent men and women who were among the\ndelegates. Miss Anthony and I were invited to take part in the funeral\nservices, and she made a short address, while I offered a prayer.\n\nThe event had an aftermath in Atlanta, for it led our clerical enemy\nto repeat his charges against us, and to offer the funeral of Frederick\nDouglass as proof that we were hand in glove with the negro race.\n\nUnder the gracious direction of Miss Kate Gordon and the Louisiana Woman\nSuffrage Association, we held an especially inspiring convention in\nNew Orleans in 1903. In no previous convention were arrangements\nmore perfect, and certainly nowhere else did the men of a community\nco-operate more generously with the women in entertaining us. A club of\nmen paid the rent of our hall, chartered a steamboat and gave us a ride\non the Mississippi, and in many other ways helped to make the occasion\na success. Miss Gordon, who was chairman of the programme committee,\nintroduced the innovation of putting me before the audience for twenty\nminutes every evening, at the close of the regular session, as a target\nfor questions. Those present were privileged to ask any questions they\npleased, and I answered them--if I could.\n\nWe were all conscious of the dangers attending a discussion of the negro\nquestion, and it was understood among the Northern women that we must\ntake every precaution to avoid being led into such discussion. It had\nnot been easy to persuade Miss Anthony of the wisdom of this course; her\nway was to face issues squarely and out in the open. But she agreed that\nwe must respect the convictions of the Southern men and women who were\nentertaining us so hospitably.\n\nOn the opening night, as I took my place to answer questions, almost the\nfirst slip passed up bore these words:\n\n\nWhat is your purpose in bringing your convention to the South? Is it the\ndesire of suffragists to force upon us the social equality of black and\nwhite women? Political equality lays the foundation for social equality.\nIf you give the ballot to women, won't you make the black and white\nwoman equal politically and therefore lay the foundation for a future\nclaim of social equality?\n\n\nI laid the paper on one side and did not answer the question. The second\nnight it came to me again, put in the same words, and again I ignored\nit. The third night it came with this addition:\n\nEvidently you do not dare to answer this question. Therefore our\nconclusion is that this is your purpose.\n\n\nWhen I had read this I went to the front of the platform.\n\n\"Here,\" I said, \"is a question which has been asked me on three\nsuccessive nights. I have not answered it because we Northern women had\ndecided not to enter into any discussion of the race question. But now I\nam told by the writer of this note that we dare not answer it. I wish\nto say that we dare to answer it if you dare to have it answered--and I\nleave it to you to decide whether I shall answer it or not.\"\n\nI read the question aloud. Then the audience called for the answer, and\nI gave it in these words, quoted as accurately as I can remember them:\n\n\"If political equality is the basis of social equality, and if by\ngranting political equality you lay the foundation for a claim of social\nequality, I can only answer that you have already laid that claim. You\ndid not wait for woman suffrage, but disfranchised both your black and\nyour white women, thus making them politically equal. But you have done\nmore than that. You have put the ballot into the hands of your black\nmen, thus making them the political superiors of your white women.\nNever before in the history of the world have men made former slaves the\npolitical masters of their former mistresses!\"\n\nThe point went home and it went deep. I drove it in a little further.\n\n\"The women of the South are not alone,\" I said, \"in their humiliation.\nAll the women of America share it with them. There is no other nation in\nthe world in which women hold the position of political degradation our\nAmerican women hold to-day. German women are governed by German men;\nFrench women are governed by French men. But in these United States\nAmerican women are governed by every race of men under the light of the\nsun. There is not a color from white to black, from red to yellow, there\nis not a nation from pole to pole, that does not send its contingent to\ngovern American women. If American men are willing to leave their women\nin a position as degrading as this they need not be surprised when\nAmerican women resolve to lift themselves out of it.\"\n\nFor a full moment after I had finished there was absolute silence in\nthe audience. We did not know what would happen. Then, suddenly, as the\ntruth of the statement struck them, the men began to applaud--and the\ndanger of that situation was over.\n\nAnother episode had its part in driving the suffrage lesson home to\nSouthern women. The Legislature had passed a bill permitting tax-paying\nwomen to vote at any election where special taxes were to be imposed for\nimprovements, and the first election following the passage of this bill\nwas one in New Orleans, in which the question of better drainage for\nthe city was before the public. Miss Gordon and the suffrage association\nknown as the Era Club entered enthusiastically into the fight for\ngood drainage. According to the law women could vote by proxy if they\npreferred, instead of in person, so Miss Gordon drove to the homes of\nthe old conservative Creole families and other families whose women\nwere unwilling to vote in public, and she collected their proxies while\nincidentally she showed them what position they held under the law.\n\nWith each proxy it was necessary to have the signature of a witness, but\naccording to the Louisiana law no woman could witness a legal document.\nMiss Gordon was driven from place to place by her colored coachman, and\nafter she had secured the proxy of her temporary hostess it was usually\ndiscovered that there was no man around the place to act as a witness.\nThis was Miss Gordon's opportunity. With a smile of great sweetness she\nwould say, \"I will have Sam come in and help us out\"; and the colored\ncoachman would get down from his box, and by scrawling his signature on\nthe proxy of the aristocratic lady he would give it the legal value it\nlacked. In this way Miss Gordon secured three hundred proxies, and three\nhundred very conservative women had an opportunity to compare their\nlegal standing with Sam's. The drainage bill was carried and interest in\nwoman suffrage developed steadily.\n\nThe special incident of the Buffalo convention of 1908 was the receipt\nof a note which was passed up to me as I sat on the platform. When I\nopened it a check dropped out--a check so large that I was sure it had\nbeen sent by mistake. However, after asking one or two friends on the\nplatform if I had read it correctly, I announced to the audience that if\na certain amount were subscribed immediately I would reveal a secret--a\nvery interesting secret. Audiences are as curious as individuals. The\namount was at once subscribed. Then I held up a check for $10,000, given\nfor our campaign work by Mrs. George Howard Lewis, in memory of Susan B.\nAnthony, and I read to the audience the charming letter that accompanied\nit. The money was used during the campaigns of the following year--part\nof it in Washington, where an amendment was already submitted.\n\nIn a previous chapter I have described the establishment of our New York\nheadquarters as a result of the generous offer of Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont\nat the Seattle convention in 1909. During our first year in these\nbeautiful Fifth Avenue rooms Mrs. Pankhurst made her first visit to\nAmerica, and we gave her a reception there. This, however, was before\nthe adoption of the destructive methods which have since marked the\nactivities of the band of militant suffragists of which Mrs. Pankhurst\nis president. There has never been any sympathy among American\nsuffragists for the militant suffrage movement in England, and\npersonally I am wholly opposed to it. I do not believe in war in any\nform; and if violence on the part of men is undesirable in achieving\ntheir ends, it is much more so on the part of women; for women never\nappear to less advantage than in physical combats with men. As for\nmilitancy in America, no generation that attempted it could win. No\nvictory could come to us in any state where militant methods were tried.\nThey are undignified, unworthy--in other words, un-American.\n\nThe Washington convention of 1910 was graced by the presence of\nPresident Taft, who, at the invitation of Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery,\nmade an address. It was understood, of course, that he was to come\nout strongly for woman suffrage; but, to our great disappointment, the\nPresident, a most charming and likable gentleman, seemed unable to grasp\nthe significance of the occasion. He began his address with fulsome\npraise of women, which was accepted in respectful silence. Then he got\nround to woman suffrage, floundered helplessly, became confused, and\nended with the most unfortunately chosen words he could have uttered: \"I\nam opposed,\" he said, \"to the extension of suffrage to women not fitted\nto vote. You would hardly expect to put the ballot into the hands of\nbarbarians or savages in the jungle!\"\n\nThe dropping of these remarkable words into a suffrage convention was\nnaturally followed by an oppressive silence, which Mr. Taft, now wholly\nbereft of his self-possession, broke by saying that the best women would\nnot vote and the worst women would.\n\nIn his audience were many women from suffrage states--high-minded women,\nwives and mothers, who had voted for Mr. Taft. The remarks to which\nthey had just listened must have seemed to them a poor return. Some one\nhissed--some man, some woman--no one knows which except the culprit--and\na demonstration started which I immediately silenced. Then the President\nfinished his address. He was very gracious to us when he left, shaking\nhands with many of us, and being especially cordial to Senator Owens's\naged mother, who had come to the convention to hear him make his maiden\nspeech on woman suffrage. I have often wondered what he thought of that\nspeech as he drove back to the White House. Probably he regretted as\nearnestly as we did that he had made it.\n\nIn 1912, at an official board meeting at Bryn Mawr, Mrs. Stanley\nMcCormack was appointed to fill a vacancy on the National Board.\nSubsequently she contributed $6,000 toward the payment of debts incident\nto our temporary connection with the Woman's Journal of Boston, and\ndid much efficient work for us, To me, personally, the entrance of\nMrs. Stanley McCormack into our work has been a source of the deepest\ngratification and comfort. I can truly say of her what Susan B. Anthony\nsaid of me, \"She is my right bower.\" At Nashville, in 1914, she was\nelected first vice-president, and to a remarkable degree she has since\nrelieved me of the burden of the technical work of the presidency,\nincluding the oversight of the work at headquarters. To this she gives\nall her time, aided by an executive secretary who takes charge of the\nroutine work of the association. She has thus made it possible for me\nto give the greater part of my time to the field in which such inspiring\nopportunities still confront us--campaign work in the various states.\n\nTo Mrs. Medill McCormack also we are indebted for most admirable work\nand enthusiastic support. At the Washington (D.C.) convention in 1913\nshe was made the chairman of the Congressional Committee, with Mrs.\nAntoinette Funk, Mrs. Helen Gardner of Washington, and Mrs. Booth of\nChicago as her assistants. The results they achieved were so brilliant\nthat they were unanimously re-elected to the same positions this year,\nwith the addition of Miss Jeannette Rankin, whose energy and service had\nhelped to win for us the state of Montana.\n\nIt was largely due to the work of this Congressional Committee,\nsupported by the large number of states which had been won for suffrage,\nthat we secured such an excellent vote in the Lower House of Congress\non the bill to amend the national Constitution granting suffrage to the\nwomen of the United States. This measure, known as the Susan B. Anthony\nbill, had been introduced into every Congress for forty-three years by\nthe National Woman Suffrage Association. In 1914, for the first time,\nit was brought out of committee, debated, and voted upon in the Lower\nHouse. We received 174 votes in favor of it to 204 against it. The\nprevious spring, in the same Congress, the same bill passed the Senate\nby 35 votes for it to 33 votes against it.\n\nThe most interesting features of the Washington convention of 1913 were\nthe labor mass-meetings led by Jane Addams and the hearing before the\nRules Committee of the Lower House of Congress--the latter the first\nhearing ever held before this Committee for the purpose of securing a\nCommittee on Suffrage in the Lower House to correspond with a similar\ncommittee in the Senate. For many years we had had hearings before the\nJudiciary Committee of the Lower House, which was such a busy committee\nthat it had neither time nor interest to give to our measure. We\ntherefore considered it necessary to have a special committee of\nour own. The hearing began on the morning of Wednesday, the third of\nDecember, and lasted for two hours. Then the anti-suffragists were given\ntime, and their hearing began the following day, continued throughout\nthat day and during the morning of the next day, when our National\nAssociation was given an opportunity for rebuttal argument in the\nafternoon. It was the longest hearing in the history of the suffrage\nmovement, and one of the most important.\n\nDuring the session of Congress in 1914 another strenuous effort was made\nto secure the appointment of a special suffrage committee in the Lower\nHouse. But when success began to loom large before us the Democrats were\ncalled in caucus by the minority leader, Mr. Underwood, of Alabama, and\nthey downed our measure by a vote of 127 against it to 58 for it. This\nwas evidently done by the Democrats because of the fear that the united\nvotes of Republican and Progressive members, with those of certain\nDemocratic members, would carry the measure; whereas if this caucus were\ncalled, and an unfavorable vote taken, \"the gentlemen's agreement\" which\ncontrols Democratic party action in Congress would force Democrats in\nfavor of suffrage to vote against the appointment of the committee,\nwhich of course would insure its defeat.\n\nThe caucus blocked the appointment of the committee, but it gave great\nencouragement to the suffragists of the country, for they knew it to be\na tacit admission that the measure would receive a favorable vote if it\ncame before Congress unhampered.\n\nAnother feature of the 1913 convention was the new method of electing\nofficers, by which a primary vote was taken on nominations, and\nafterward a regular ballot was cast; one officer was added to the\nmembers of the official board, making nine instead of eight, the former\nnumber. The new officers elected were Mrs. Breckenridge of Kentucky,\nthe great-granddaughter of Henry Clay, and Mrs. Catherine Ruutz-Rees\nof Greenwich, Connecticut. The old officers were re-elected--Miss Jane\nAddams as first vice-president, Mrs. Breckenridge and Mrs. Ruutz-Rees\nas second and third vice-presidents, Mrs. Mary Ware Dennett as\ncorresponding secretary, Mrs. Susan Fitzgerald as recording secretary,\nMrs. Stanley McCormack as treasurer, Mrs. Joseph Bowen of Chicago and\nMrs. James Lees Laidlaw of New York City as auditors.\n\nIt would be difficult to secure a group of women of more marked\nability, or better-known workers in various lines of philanthropic and\neducational work, than the members composing this admirable board. At\nthe convention of 1914, held in Nashville, several of them resigned, and\nat present (in 1914) the \"National's\" affairs are in the hands of this\ninspiring group, again headed by the much-criticized and chastened\nwriter of these reminiscences:\n\n     Mrs. Stanley McCormack, first vice-president.\n     Mrs. Desha Breckenridge, second vice-president.\n     Dr. Katharine B. Davis, third vice-president.\n     Mrs. Henry Wade Rogers, treasurer.\n     Mrs. John Clark, corresponding secretary.\n     Mrs. Susan Walker Fitzgerald, recording secretary.\n     Mrs. Medill McCormack,                  }\n                                             } Auditors\n     Mrs. Walter McNabb Miller, of Missouri  }\n\n\nIn a book of this size, and covering the details of my own life as well\nas the development of the great Cause, it is, of course, impossible\nto mention by name each woman who has worked for us--though, indeed,\nI would like to make a roll of honor and give them all their due. In\nlooking back I am surprised to see how little I have said about many\nwomen with whom I have worked most closely--Rachel Foster Avery, for\nexample, with whom I lived happily for several years; Ida Husted Harper,\nthe historian of the suffrage movement and the biographer of Miss\nAnthony, with whom I made many delightful voyages to Europe; Alice Stone\nBlackwell, Rev. Mary Saffard, Jane Addams, Katharine Waugh McCullough,\nElla Stewart, Mrs. Mary Wood Swift, Mrs. Mary S. Sperry, Mary Cogshall,\nFlorence Kelly, Mrs. Ogden Mills Reid and Mrs. Norman Whitehouse (to\nmention only two of the younger \"live wires\" in our New York work),\nSophonisba Breckenridge, Mrs. Clara B. Arthur, Rev. Caroline Bartlett\nCrane, Mrs. James Lees Laidlaw, Mrs. Raymond Brown, the splendidly\nexecutive president of our New York State Suffrage Association, and my\nbenefactress, Mrs. George Howard Lewis of Buffalo. To all of them,\nand to thousands of others, I make my grateful acknowledgment of\nindebtedness for friendship and for help.\n\n\n\n\nXVI. COUNCIL EPISODES\n\nI have said much of the interest attending the international meetings\nheld in Chicago, London, Berlin, and Stockholm. That I have said less\nabout those in Copenhagen, Geneva, The Hague, Budapest, and other\ncities does not mean that these were less important, and certainly the\nwonderful women leaders of Europe who made them so brilliant must not be\npassed over in silence.\n\nFirst, however, the difference between the Suffrage Alliance meetings\nand the International Council meetings should be explained. The Council\nmeetings are made up of societies from the various nations which are\nauxiliary to the International Council--these societies representing all\nlines of women's activities, whether educational, industrial, or\nsocial, while the membership, including more than eleven million women,\nrepresents probably the largest organization of women in the world.\nThe International Suffrage Alliance represents the suffrage interest\nprimarily, whereas the International Council has only a suffrage\ndepartment. So popular did this International Alliance become after\nits formation in Berlin by Mrs. Catt, in 1904, that at the Copenhagen\nmeeting, only three years later, more than sixteen different nations\nwere represented by regular delegates.\n\nIt was unfortunate, therefore, that I chose this occasion to make a\nspectacular personal failure in the pulpit. I had been invited to\npreach the convention sermon, and for the first time in my life I had an\ninterpreter. Few experiences, I believe, can be more unpleasant than to\nstand up in a pulpit, utter a remark, and then wait patiently while it\nis repeated in a tongue one does not understand, by a man who is\nputting its gist in his own words and quite possibly giving it his own\ninterpretative twist. I was very unhappy, and I fear I showed it, for I\nfelt, as I looked at the faces of those friends who understood Danish,\nthat they were not getting what I was giving them. Nor were they, for\nI afterward learned that the interpreter, a good orthodox brother, had\ngiven the sermon an ultra-orthodox bias which those who knew my creed\ncertainly did not recognize. The whole experience greatly disheartened\nme, but no doubt it was good for my soul.\n\nDuring the Copenhagen meeting we were given a banquet by the City\nCouncil, and in the course of his speech of welcome one of the city\nfathers airily remarked that he hoped on our next visit to Copenhagen\nthere would be women members in the Council to receive us. At the time\nthis seemed merely a pleasant jest, but two years from that day a bill\nwas enacted by Parliament granting municipal suffrage to the women of\nDenmark, and seven women were elected to the City Council of Copenhagen.\nSo rapidly does the woman suffrage movement grow in these inspiring\ndays!\n\nRecalling the International Council of 1899 in London, one of my most\nvivid pictures has Queen Victoria for its central figure. The English\ncourt was in mourning at the time and no public audiences were being\nheld; but we were invited to Windsor with the understanding that,\nalthough the Queen could not formally receive us, she would pass\nthrough our lines, receiving Lady Aberdeen and giving the rest of us\nan opportunity to courtesy and obtain Her Majesty's recognition of the\nCause. The Queen arranged with her chamberlain that we should be given\ntea and a collation; but before this refreshment was served, indeed\nimmediately after our arrival, she entered her familiar little pony-cart\nand was driven slowly along lines of bowing women who must have looked\nlike a wheat-field in a high wind.\n\nAmong us was a group of Indian women, and these, dressed in their native\ncostumes, contributed a picturesque bit of brilliant color to the scene\nas they deeply salaamed. They arrested the eye of the Queen, who stopped\nand spoke a few cordial words to them. This gave the rest of us an\nexcellent opportunity to observe her closely, and I admit that my\nEnglish blood stirred in me suddenly and loyally as I studied the plump\nlittle figure. She was dressed entirely and very simply in black, with a\nquaint flat black hat and a black cape. The only bit of color about her\nwas a black-and-white parasol with a gold handle. It was, however, her\nface which held me, for it gave me a wholly different impression of the\nQueen from those I had received from her photographs. Her pictured eyes\nwere always rather cold, and her pictured face rather haughty; but there\nwas a very sweet and winning softness in the eyes she turned upon the\nIndian women, and her whole expression was unexpectedly gentle and\nbenignant. Behind her, as a personal attendant, strode an enormous\nEast-Indian in full native costume, and closely surrounding her were\ngentlemen of her household, each in uniform.\n\nBy this time my thoughts were on my courtesy, which I desired to make\nconventional if not graceful; but nature has not made it easy for me to\ndouble to the earth as Lady Aberdeen and the Indian women were doing,\nand I fear I accomplished little save an exhibition of good intentions.\nThe Queen, however, was getting into the spirit of the occasion. She\nstopped to speak to a Canadian representative, and she would, I think,\nhave ended by talking to many others; but, just at the psychological\nmoment, a woman rushed out of the line, seized Her Majesty's hand\nand kissed it--and Victoria, startled and possibly fearing a general\nonslaught, hurriedly passed on.\n\nAnother picture I recall was made by the Duchess of Sutherland, the\nCountess of Aberdeen, and the Countess of Warwick standing together to\nreceive us at the foot of the marble stairway in Sutherland House. All\nof them literally blazed with jewels, and the Countess of Aberdeen wore\nthe famous Aberdeen emerald. At Lady Battersea's reception I had my\nfirst memorial meeting with Mary Anderson Navarro, and was able to thank\nher for the pleasure she had given me in Boston so long ago. Then I\nreproached her mildly for taking herself away from us, pointing out that\na great gift had been given her which she should have continued to share\nwith the world.\n\n\"Come and see my baby,\" laughed Madame Navarro. \"That's the best\nargument I can offer to refute yours.\"\n\nAt the same reception I had an interesting talk with James Bryce. He had\nrecently written his American Commonwealth, and I had just read it. It\nwas, therefore, the first subject I introduced in our conversation. Mr.\nBryce's comment amused me. He told me he had quite changed his opinion\ntoward the suffrage aspirations of women, because so many women had read\nhis book that he really believed they were intelligent, and he had come\nto feel much more kindly toward them. These were not his exact words,\nbut his meaning was unmistakable and his mental attitude artlessly\nsincere. And, on reflection, I agree with him that the American\nCommonwealth is something of an intellectual hurdle for the average\nhuman mind.\n\nIn 1908 the International Council was held in Geneva, and here, for\nthe first time, we were shown, as entertainment, the dances of a\ncountry--the scene being an especially brilliant one, as all the dancers\nwore their native costumes. Also, for the first time in the history of\nGeneva, the buildings of Parliament were opened to women and a woman's\norganization was given the key to the city. At that time the Swiss women\nwere making their fight for a vote in church matters, and we helped\ntheir cause as much as we could. To-day many Swiss women are permitted\nto exercise this right--the first political privilege free Switzerland\nhas given them.\n\nThe International Alliance meeting in Amsterdam in 1909 was the largest\nheld up to that time, and much of its success was due to Dr. Aletta\nJacobs, the president of the National Suffrage Association of Holland.\nDr. Jacobs had some wonderful helpers among the women of her country,\nand she herself was an ideal leader--patient, enthusiastic, and\ntireless. That year the governments of Australia, Norway, and Finland\npaid the expenses of the delegates from those countries--a heartening\ninnovation. One of the interesting features of the meeting was a cantata\ncomposed for the occasion and given by the Queen's Royal Band, under\nthe direction of a woman--Catharine van Rennes, one of the most\ndistinguished composers and teachers in Holland. She wrote both words\nand music of her cantata and directed it admirably; and the musicians\nof the Queen's Band entered fully into its spirit and played like\nmen inspired. That night we had more music, as well as a\nnever-to-be-forgotten exhibition of folk-dancing.\n\nThe same year, in June, we held the meeting of the International\nCouncil in Toronto, and, as Canada has never been eagerly interested in\nsuffrage, an unsuccessful effort was made to exclude this subject from\nthe programme. I was asked to preside at the suffrage meetings on the\nartless and obvious theory that I would thus be kept too busy to say\nmuch. I had hoped that the Countess of Aberdeen, who was the president\nof the International Council, would take the chair; but she declined\nto do this, or even to speak, as the Earl of Aberdeen had recently\nbeen appointed Viceroy of Ireland, and she desired to spare him any\nembarrassment which might be caused by her public activities. We\nrecognized the wisdom of her decision, but, of course, regretted it;\nand I was therefore especially pleased when, on suffrage night, the\ncountess, accompanied by her aides in their brilliant uniforms, entered\nthe hall. We had not been sure that she would be with us, but she\nentered in her usual charming and gracious manner, took a seat beside\nme on the platform, and showed a deep interest in the programme and the\ngreat gathering before us.\n\nAs the meeting went on I saw that she was growing more and more\nenthusiastic, and toward the end of the evening I quietly asked her if\nshe did not wish to say a few words. She said she would say a very few.\nI had put myself at the end of the programme, intending to talk\nabout twenty minutes; but before beginning my speech I introduced the\ncountess, and by this time she was so enthusiastic that, to my great\ndelight, she used up my twenty minutes in a capital speech in which\nshe came out vigorously for woman suffrage. It gave us the best and\ntimeliest help we could have had, and was a great impetus to the\nmovement.\n\nIn London, at the Alliance Council of 1911, we were entertained for\nthe first time by a suffrage organization of men, and by the organized\nactresses of the nation, as well as by the authors.\n\nIn Stockholm, the following year, we listened to several of the most\ninteresting women speakers in the world--Selma Lagerlof, who had just\nreceived the Nobel prize, Rosica Schwimmer of Hungary, Dr. Augsburg\nof Munich, and Mrs. Philip Snowden of England. Miss Schwimmer and Mrs.\nSnowden have since become familiar to American audiences, but until that\ntime I had not heard either of them, and I was immensely impressed by\ntheir ability and their different methods--Miss Schwimmer being all\nforce and fire, alive from her feet to her finger-tips, Mrs. Snowden all\nquiet reserve and dignity. Dr. Augsburg wore her hair short and dressed\nin a most eccentric manner; but we forgot her appearance as we listened\nto her, for she was an inspired speaker.\n\nSelma Lagerlof's speech made the great audience weep. Men as well\nas women openly wiped their eyes as she described the sacrifice and\nsuffering of Swedish women whose men had gone to America to make a home\nthere, and who, when they were left behind, struggled alone, waiting\nand hoping for the message to join their husbands, which too often never\ncame. The speech made so great an impression that we had it translated\nand distributed among the Swedes of the United States wherever we held\nmeetings in Swedish localities.\n\nMiss Lagerlof interested me extremely, and I was delighted by an\ninvitation to breakfast with her one morning. At our first meeting she\nhad seemed rather cold and shy--a little \"difficult,\" as we say; but\nwhen we began to talk I found her frank, cordial, and full of magnetism.\nShe is self-conscious about her English, but really speaks our language\nvery well. Her great interest at the time was in improving the condition\nof the peasants near her home. She talked of this work and of her books\nand of the Council programme with such friendly intimacy that when we\nparted I felt that I had always known her.\n\nAt the Hague Council in 1913 I was the guest of Mrs. Richard Halter, to\nwhom I am also indebted for a beautiful and wonderful motor journey from\nend to end of Holland, bringing up finally in Amsterdam at the home of\nDr. Aletta Jacobs. Here we met two young Holland women, Miss Boissevain\nand Rosa Manus, both wealthy, both anxious to help their countrywomen,\nbut still a little uncertain as to the direction of their efforts. They\ncame to Mrs. Catt and me and asked our advice as to what they should\ndo, with the result that later they organized and put through, largely\nunaided, a national exposition showing the development of women's work\nfrom 1813 to 1913. The suffrage-room at this exposition showed the\nprogress of suffrage in all parts of the world; but when the Queen of\nHolland visited the building she expressed a wish not to be detained in\nthis room, as she was not interested in suffrage. The Prince Consort,\nhowever, spent much time in it, and wanted the whole suffrage movement\nexplained to him, which was done cheerfully and thoroughly by Miss\nBoissevain and Miss Manus. The following winter, when the Queen read her\naddress from the throne, she expressed an interest in so changing the\nConstitution of Holland that suffrage might possibly be extended to\nwomen. We felt that this change of heart was due to the suffrage-room\narranged by our two young friends--aided, probably, by a few words from\nthe Prince Consort!\n\nImmediately after these days at Amsterdam we started for Budapest to\nattend the International Alliance Convention there, and incidentally we\nindulged in a series of two-day conventions en route--one at Berlin,\none at Dresden, one at Prague, and one at Vienna. At Prague I disgraced\nmyself by being in my hotel room in a sleep of utter exhaustion at the\nhour when I was supposed to be responding to an address of welcome by\nthe mayor; and the high-light of the evening session in that city falls\non the intellectual brow of a Bohemian lady who insisted on making her\naddress in the Czech language, which she poured forth for exactly one\nhour and fifteen minutes. I began my address at a quarter of twelve and\nleft the hall at midnight. Later I learned that the last speaker began\nher remarks at a quarter past one in the morning.\n\nIt may be in order to add here that Vienna did for me what Berlin had\ndone for Susan B. Anthony--it gave me the ovation of my life. At the\nconclusion of my speech the great audience rose and, still standing,\ncheered for many minutes. I was immensely surprised and deeply\ntouched by the unexpected tribute; but any undue elation I might have\nexperienced was checked by the memory of the skeptical snort with which\none of my auditors had received me. He was very German, and very, very\nfrank. After one pained look at me he rose to leave the hall.\n\n\"THAT old woman!\" he exclaimed. \"She cannot make herself heard.\"\n\nHe was half-way down the aisle when the opening words of my address\ncaught up with him and stopped him. Whatever their meaning may have\nbeen, it was at least carried to the far ends of that great hall, for\nthe old fellow had piqued me a bit and I had given my voice its fullest\nvolume. He crowded into an already over-occupied pew and stared at me\nwith goggling eyes.\n\n\"Mein Gott!\" he gasped. \"Mein Gott, she could be heard ANYWHERE.\"\n\nThe meeting at Budapest was a great personal triumph for Mrs. Catt. No\none, I am sure, but the almost adored president of the International\nSuffrage Alliance could have controlled a convention made up of women\nof so many different nationalities, with so many different viewpoints,\nwhile the confusion of languages made a general understanding seem\nalmost hopeless. But it was a great success in every way--and a\ndelightful feature of it was the hospitality of the city officials and,\nindeed, of the whole Hungarian people. After the convention I spent\na week with the Contessa Iska Teleki in her chateau in the Tatra\nMountains, and a friendship was there formed which ever since has been\na joy to me. Together we walked miles over the mountains and along\nthe banks of wonderful streams, while the countess, who knows all the\nfolk-lore of her land, told me stories and answered my innumerable\nquestions. When I left for Vienna I took with me a basket of tiny\nfir-trees from the tops of the Tatras; and after carrying the basket to\nand around Vienna, Florence, and Genoa, I finally got the trees home\nin good condition and proudly added them to the \"Forest of Arden\" on my\nplace at Moylan.\n\n\n\n\nXVII. VALE!\n\nIn looking back over the ten years of my administration as president\nof the National American Woman Suffrage Association, there can be no\nfeeling but gratitude and elation over the growth of the work. Our\nmembership has grown from 17,000 women to more than 200,000, and the\nnumber of auxiliary societies has increased in proportion.\n\nInstead of the old-time experience of one campaign in ten years, we\nnow have from five to ten campaigns each year. From an original yearly\nexpenditure of $14,000 or $15,000 in our campaign work, we now expend\nfrom $40,000 to $50,000. In New York, in 1915, we have already received\npledges of $150,000 for the New York State campaign alone, while\nPennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have made pledges in\nproportion.\n\nIn 1906 full suffrage prevailed in four states; we now have it in\ntwelve. Our movement has advanced from its academic stage until it\nhas become a vital political factor; no reform in the country is more\nheralded by the press or receives more attention from the public. It has\nbecome an issue which engages the attention of the entire nation--and\ntoward this result every woman working for the Cause has contributed to\nan inspiring degree. Splendid team-work, and that alone, has made\nour present success possible and our eventual triumph in every state\ninevitable. Every officer in our organization, every leader in our\ncampaigns, every speaker, every worker in the ranks, however humble, has\ndone her share.\n\nI do not claim anything so fantastic and Utopian as universal harmony\namong us. We have had our troubles and our differences. I have had mine.\nAt every annual convention since the one at Washington in 1910 there has\nbeen an effort to depose me from the presidency. There have been some\nsplendid fighters among my opponents--fine and high-minded women who\nsincerely believe that at sixty-eight I am getting too old for my big\njob. Possibly I am. Certainly I shall resign it with alacrity when the\nmajority of women in the organization wish me to do so. At present a\nlarge majority proves annually that it still has faith in my leadership,\nand with this assurance I am content to work on.\n\nLooking back over the period covered by these reminiscences, I realize\nthat there is truth in the grave charge that I am no longer young; and\nthis truth was once voiced by one of my little nieces in a way that\nbrought it strongly home to me. She and her small sister of six had\ndeclared themselves suffragettes, and as the first result of their\nconversion to the Cause both had been laughed at by their schoolmates.\nThe younger child came home after this tragic experience, weeping\nbitterly and declaring that she did not wish to be a suffragette any\nmore--an exhibition of apostasy for which her wise sister of eight took\nher roundly to task.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of yourself,\" she demanded, \"to stop just because\nyou have been laughed at once? Look at Aunt Anna! SHE has been laughed\nat for hundreds of years!\"\n\nI sometimes feel that it has indeed been hundreds of years since my work\nbegan; and then again it seems so brief a time that, by listening for\na moment, I fancy I can hear the echo of my childish-voice preaching to\nthe trees in the Michigan woods.\n\nBut long or short, the one sure thing is that, taking it all in all, the\nstruggles, the discouragements, the failures, and the little victories,\nthe fight has been, as Susan B. Anthony said in her last hours, \"worth\nwhile.\" Nothing bigger can come to a human being than to love a great\nCause more than life itself, and to have the privilege throughout life\nof working for that Cause.\n\nAs for life's other gifts, I have had some of them, too. I have made\nmany friendships; I have looked upon the beauty of many lands; I have\nthe assurance of the respect and affection of thousands of men and women\nI have never even met. Though I have given all I had, I have received a\nthousand times more than I have given. Neither the world nor my Cause is\nindebted to me but from the depths of a full and very grateful heart I\nacknowledge my lasting indebtedness to them both.\n\nTHE END",
